this report, we mainly demonstrate our research by 
three parts: the numerical models by boundary-type, 
domain-type, and the technique of interpolation for 
high-dimension cases.  
The boundary-type methods have the advantage of high 
accuracy and the high efficiency for numerical 
simulations by reducing the dimension of the 
problems, such as the famous method of fundamental

for the problems with fundamental solutions, and 
hence they are rarely considered in engineering 
problems. By our research of the boundary-type 
models, we make it possible for the MFS applied to 
the numerical model of wave and non-Newtonian fluid.

verified through simulating two typical SWE problems: 
a tidal wave and a dam-break problem, and then 
applied to the numerical analysis of the inflow

which is located at the upstream of the Keelung River 
in Taiwan.  
In addition to the establishment of the numerical

dimensional numerical examples governed respectively 
by the Poisson and the advection-diffusion equations 
are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and the

Abstract 
This study aims to employ meshless methods to establish numerical models for the 
numerical analysis of real-life engineering problems. The meshless methods are 
divided into boundary-type and domain-type fashions generally, and use both types 
are applied in this three-year project as an innovation of the region of 
computational-fluid dynamics. In this report, we mainly demonstrate our research by 
three parts: the numerical models by boundary-type, domain-type, and their 
application to the technique of interpolation for high-dimension cases.  
The boundary-type methods have the advantage of high accuracy and the high 
efficiency for numerical simulations by reducing the dimension of the problems, such 
as the famous method of fundamental solutions (MFS). However, they are only 
applicable for the problems with fundamental solutions, and hence they are rarely 
considered in engineering problems. By our research of the boundary-type models, we 
make it possible for the MFS applied to the numerical model of wave and 
non-Newtonian fluid. In the further work, we will continue the evolution of the 
research for the boundary-type models. 
For the research of domain-type models, we apply the local radial-basis-function 
based differential quadrature (LRBFDQ) method to establish a numerical model of 2D 
nonlinear shallow water equations (SWE). In this work, the established numerical 
model is verified through simulating two typical SWE problems: a tidal wave and a 
dam-break problem, and then applied to the numerical analysis of the inflow discharge 
in the Yuanshantze Flood Diversion (YFD) which is located at the upstream of the 
Keelung River in Taiwan. As a result, the verification shows that the adopted meshless 
method not only has superiority, but also brings better efficiency than several 
conventional meshless methods. Moreover, the acceptability of the measurement of the 
YFD problem is also verified according to the numerical analysis by our model. 
In addition to the establishment of the numerical models, an interpolation technique 
based on the LRBFDQ method is proposed to interpolate the field values with 
arbitrarily scattered given data. Three-dimensional numerical examples governed 
respectively by the Poisson and the advection-diffusion equations are performed to 
demonstrate the accuracy and the stability of the presented methods. The results are 
compared with those by the LPF and the QPF methods which show that the current 
interpolation methods are more accurate and robust than the conventional ones. 
By this report, it is convinced that we have successfully developed both the 
domain-type and boundary-type meshless numerical models in this three-year project. 
In the further work, we will continue to extend our existing meshless models to the 
numerical simulations of real-life problems.

1. Boundary-type meshless method 
1.1. Introduction 
In the recent years, the meshless or mesh-free methods have received a considerable 
attention as alternative numerical schemes to the classical mesh-dependent numerical 
methods. The boundary element method (BEM) is one of the most common 
mesh-reduction methods. One great advantage of this method is that the dimensionality 
of the problem is reduced by one order. Zhu (1998), Zhu et al. (1998), Bulgakov et al. 
(1998), Zerroukat (1999), Sutradhar et al. (2002), and Bialecki et al. (2002) applied the 
BEM to solve diffusion equations. However, when the governing equation contains any 
non-homogeneous term then the governing equation can be treated by the dual 
reciprocity method, which involves domain discretization and was by Nardini and 
Brebbia (1982). Most of the numerical schemes based on the boundary element method 
treats the time derivative term in the diffusion equation either using the Laplace 
transform [Zhu (1998), Zhu et al.(1998), Sutradhar et al.(2002)] or the finite difference 
scheme [Bulgakov et al.(1998)] to advance the solution in the time domain. However, 
the main drawback of the boundary element method is the determination of the singular 
integrals at the boundaries, which requires a great amount of computational effort 
especially for the case of three-dimensional problems. 
The problem posed by the boundary element method can be alleviated by the use of the 
method of fundamental solutions. Detailed accounts of this method for various types of 
partial differential equations were summarized by Tsai (2002). The method of 
fundamental solutions makes use of the fundamental solution to the given problem by 
satisfying the governing differential equation in the interior of the computational 
domain under consideration. By means of boundary collocation method, the boundary 
conditions for the problem are satisfied. This method is free from the singular integral 
evaluation problem as required by the boundary element method. If a fundamental 
solution exists for the given governing equation, then the method of fundamental 
solutions can be utilized to obtain numerical solutions of the variable at a definite 
number of points in the domain. Golberg (1995) and Golberg & Chen (1999) used the 
method of fundamental solutions to obtain numerical solution of the Poisson equation. 
Fairweather & Karageorghis(1998) and Poullikkas et al. (1998a, 1998b) solved the 
harmonic and biharmonic boundary value problems by the method of fundamental 
solutions. Chen et al. (1998) and Barakrishnan & Ramachandran (2000) applied the 
method of fundamental solutions for diffusion equations by using the modified 
Helmholtz fundamental solution. Walker (1992) applied the diffusion fundamental 
solution combined with the integration in time to solve the diffusion equation. An

Figure 1.1: The physical system of the Poiseuille flow 
Fig. 1.2 shows numerical solutions obtained by MAEM and FEM. In FEM scheme, 
we adopt uniform mesh and linear element. As the figure shown, the finite element 
solutions via coarse mesh (1600 elements) underestimate the temperature. The 
MAEM solutions by N=861 and N=231 show good agreements with the finite 
element solutions via finer mesh (40000 elements). Note that the MAEM with only 
231 collation nodes can obtain the numerical solution at almost the same accuracy as 
finite element solutions with 40000 elements.

1.2.2. The time-marching method of fundamental solutions for wave equations 
The time-dependent 2D membrane vibration problem in a simple geometry having 
analytic solutions is considered to validate the capability of the proposed meshless 
method. In this problem, the physical field is governed by the two-dimensional wave 
equation with unit wave speed in the unit square domain (0, 1) × (0, 1). The initial

1.2.3. Meshless method for steady Stokes flow of non-Newtonian fluid 
The non-Newtonian Stokes equations are simulated by two radial basis function based 
method, MFSMPS and pure MPS. The non-Newtonian Stokes equations are 
transformed to Stokes equations with a non-linear source term. The numerical scheme 
of MFSMPS is combined with the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) and 
method of particular solutions (MPS). The numerical solution is the summation of a 
homogeneous part and a particular part. We obtain the homogeneous solution by using 
the MFS, and the particular solution by the MPS. This pure MPS uses the integral 
radial basis functions (RBFs) to approximate the numerical solutions. The two 
meshless methods obtain the numerical results directly without generating a mesh or 
bookkeeping elements and nodes so that the simulation process can be accelerated and 
memory requirement can be reduced. We use the power-law model to describe the 
viscosity of the non-Newtonian fluid and extend the proposed scheme to solve a 
pressure driven flow and Couette flow problems. The numerical results show good 
agreements with analytical solutions. These two meshless numerical schemes can also 
be extend to simulate practical problem, such as granular flow and polymer flow 
under some simplify condition. In this research, we used the Power law model to 
define the viscosity of the non-Newtonian fluid. 
 
The viscosity, , is a function of shear rate . K is called the consistency index and n 
is the Power law index.

1.3. Conclusions 
For the boundary-type meshless method MFS, we have accomplished the 
above-mentioned computational achievements. It is observed that the boundary-type 
meshless method provides very efficient and accurate numerical solutions. Our 
published papers of SCI journal are listed in the last section “Referee papers”. In the 
next three years, we plan to continue these researches for real-life engineering 
problems.

grids are also available. Moreover, the band-width of the resultant matrix becomes 
smaller by reducing the number of supporting nodes. Several works in recent years 
show that the LRBFDQ method is an efficient method, such as Shen et al. (2005) [21] 
and S. Soleimani, et al. (2010) [22]. 
In this article, we examine the applications of the LRBFDQ to solve the SWE. First, 
the formulations will be introduced before the application of numerical procedures in 
Section 2.2. The LRBFDQ is introduced in Section 2.3. In this section, the governing 
equations are discretized in spatial domain by LRBFDQ and temporal direction by 
FDM. Section 2.4 demonstrates three examples. In first and second case, our model is 
verified by comparing the results with analytical solutions and benchmark in articles; 
in the third case, we will employ our model to numerically analyze and discuss the 
inflow discharge of Yuanshantze Flood Diversion (YFD). Finally, conclusions and 
suggestions will be given based on our results. 
2.2. The 2D shallow-water model 
The shallow water equations (SWEs, which are also called the de Saint-Venant 
equations) are used to describe flow behaviors in bodies of water where the horizontal 
length scales are much greater than the flow depth (i.e., the long wavelength 
phenomena). Here we briefly review the 2D SWEs. 
A shallow-water flow region is illustrated in Fig. 1. By the assumption of the 
hydrostatic pressure and uniform velocity profile along the vertical direction, the 3D 
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations can be simplified to the 2D SWEs. In the 
primitive form, the governing equations including a continuity equation and a 
momentum equation in each of the x- and y-directions are shown as follows:

A rectangular channel is illustrated in Fig. 2.3 with length L=872km and width 
W=50km. Inside the channel the fluid exists with water depth bh =20m initially. Now 
a wave-making source is located at the boundary 0x  and the others are given by land 
boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are given by

Based on the value of the water depth is relatively small to the scale of the rectangular 
channel, it is assumed that the governing equations are simplified as linear SWEs. In 
this case the numerical simulation of the water depth and horizontal velocity is made 
from time t = 0s to t = 43200s (12hr). To avoid the discontinuity for the wave made at 
starting, the initial conditions (2.15) are given from the analytical solution [13] of this

Figure 2.5: Computation nodes for 2-D dam break problem (41×41 nods) 
 
When the downstream water depth is 5m, the flow is subcritical everywhere. The 
boundary conditions at 0x   and 200x m  are assumed to be transmissive and all 
other boundaries are considered as reflective. At the instant of the dam break, water is 
released through the breach, forming a positive wave propagating downstream and a 
negative wave spreading upstream. The process of dam break is shown in Fig. 2.6. 
Computed results at 7.2t s , when the waves have not yet reached all the boundaries, 
are shown in Fig. 2.7. The right moving positive wave and left moving negative wave 
are both well resolved. The 41×41 computing nodes are used for the LRBFDQ 
method. The other parameters used for simulation are supporting nodes lN  is fixed as 
13, shape parameter is 20c   and time step is 0.2t s  , respectively. The velocity 
field is illustrated in Fig. 2.8. There is no analytical solution for this test case, but in 
the literature numerical results of various authors are available. The form and 
propagating speed of the wave can be obtained by [5, 8]. We use the 81×81 and 
121×121 computing nodes to calculate the solution as shown in Fig. 2.9. The results 
were confirmed more stable to capture the fine details of the flow. The behavior of the 
relaxation schemes is in satisfactory agreement with computed results of these 
researches.

2.4.3. Numerical Analysis of the Inflow Discharge of YFD 
The main purpose of YFD is to reduce the flood disaster caused by heavy amount of 
inflow discharge from the upstream of Keelung River in Taiwan. The facility of YFD 
is illustrated as Fig. 2.10 (a). The major properties of the facility as follows: the 
inflow at AB  is a cross section of natural river with width 42.541 m; the outflow at 
EF  is a rectangular dive hole with cross section heightlength = 2.5 m 16 m; CD 
is a weir with height 3.0 m. While the water height is larger than 3.0 m, a part of the 
inflow (which may cause flood disaster in the downstream of the Keelung River) will 
flow over the weir CD into a tunnel and other water remains to flow in the Keelung 
River through EF . The manning roughness coefficient n=0.02; the bed is assumed to 
be flat with height above sea level 60 m and the slope of bed is neglected.

Figure 2.10: Illustration of YFD 
To realize its effect, the information of the inflow discharge is important. Base on the 
report in [31, 32], with known data of the water stage at location A, F and D, there are 
two main methods used in practice. First is applying the data of stage at A to the 
stage-discharge rating curve at cross section AB  made by physical-model 
experiments. As described in [31, 32], first method overestimates the inflow discharge 
because it is supercritical flow at section AB  in physical-model experiment but 
subcritical flow in real. To capture the inflow discharge more accurately, the second 
method that the inflow measurement was progressed at a temporary bridge upstream

Our numerical model employs total 1389 nodes as shown in Fig. 2.10 (b); the other 
parameters used for the simulation are described as follows: 17lN  , 10c   and 
1.0t s  . The numerical experiments include four hydrological events during 2009 
to 2010; they are Typhoon BAMA and LUBI in 2009 and heavy rain in 09/24 and 
Typhoon MEGI in 2010. The numerical results of water surface and velocity are 
shown as Fig. 2.11 and 2.12. The comparison of estimated inflow and outflow 
discharge is shown in Table 2.3 where Q_R denotes the discharge is estimated by the 
rating curve and Q_S denotes the discharge is solved by our numerical model. Results 
show that for the case Typhoon LUBI, the inflow discharge calculated by our model is 
very close to the estimation by rating curve at the temporary bridge; however, for the 
other three events, results by our model are larger than the rating curve. It is 
concluded that although the rating curve at temporary bridge can provide close result 
of inflow discharge to the numerical solution in certain cases, it also underestimate the 
inflow discharge in general.

3. Localized meshless method for 3D interpolation 
3.1. Introduction 
The Differential quadrature (DQ) method developed by Bellman et al [1971; 1972] 
states that the function derivatives can be approximated by the weighted sum of all the 
function values in the domain. In his approach, polynomials are chosen as the basis 
functions.  Hence the method is mesh-dependent and can be applied only to problem 
with regular domain and orthogonal girds. Moreover, the resultant matrix to be solved 
is highly ill-conditioned when the problem scale is too large.  To improve the 
aforementioned DQ method, Wu and Shu [2002] proposed a new method that employs 
several RBFs, including the multi-quadrature (MQ) [Kansa (1990); Kansa et al. (2000)], 
general multi-quadrature (General MQ) and the Gaussian functions as the basis 
functions, which can be applied to problem with irregular domain and unstructured 
grids. However, large condition number of the system matrix is still observed with 
increasing computational nodes. To avoid the highly ill-conditioned problem and 
improve the computational efficiency, the localized RBF-DQ (LRBF-DQ) method was 
introduced by Shu et al. [2003]. The resultant system matrix is therefore sparse. On the 
other hand, the localized version differential quadrature (LDQ) method is developed 
and applied to problems such as two dimensional flows in stream function formulation 
[Tsai et al. (2007)], stochastic volatilities [Young et al. (2009)], and two dimensional 
flows and forced convection problems [Shen et al. (2009)] . 
Franke [1982] wrote a review article that compares thoroughly various interpolation 
methods based on the radial basis functions. Among the radial basis functions 
compared, the results by the MQ are the most accurate. Hence, the MQ is chosen as the 
test function in the LRBF-DQ formulation in this study. The MQ was first developed by 
Hardy [1971] and applied to approximate the geographical elevation. The shape 
parameter, c, contained in the MQ function is chosen be an arbitrary positive value. 
However, large numerical error occurs when improper shape parameter is adopted. A 
method that can determine an appropriate shape parameter to increase the accuracy was 
proposed by Tseng [2010], and is adopted in this work.  
The present interpolation technique is an extension of the refining technique given by 
Shen [2008], which supplies a high accuracy solver under systematic and 
multi-variable numerical computation. Two novel interpolation methods are first 
presented in this work, which utilize (I) the field gradient and (II) the governing 
equation. It is noted that the introduction of the field gradient can appropriately capture 
the characteristic of the solution field. On the other hand, inclusion of the governing 
equation in the formulation will constrain the results to obey the physical law, which 
整合無網格數值方法於工程問題之研究 (97-2221-E-002-247-MY3)

to replace the polynomials as the test functions, including the MQ, the General MQ 
and the Gaussian functions to compute the weighting coefficients. The true merit of 
employing the RBFs as the test functions is to completely remove the restrictions of 
regular boundary and orthogonal grids. However, large condition number of the 
system matrix is still observed with increasing computational nodes. To avoid the 
highly ill-conditioned problem and improve the computational efficiency, the 
localized RBF-DQ (LRBF-DQ) method was introduced by Shu et al. [2003], which 
approximates the function derivatives by the weighted sum of the function values of 
the NL local supporting nodes near the reference node xi (as shown in Fig. 3.1) as

Figure 3.1:  The schematic sketch describes the local DQ formulation. 
The function derivative of the reference node can be approximated by the weighted sum of function 
values of supporting knots within the dashed line only. 
 
The system matrix is therefore sparse and the computational cost is considerably 
reduced. The weighting coefficients can be obtained similar to Eq. (3.2). After the 
weighting coefficients wij
(m)
 are solved, the m
th
 order derivative of f at the reference 
node xi
 
can be obtained by Eq. (3.3). The weighting coefficients for derivatives along 
other directions can be obtained similarly.  
Now, consider a partial differential equation L f(x) = s(x) with L denoting the linear 
operator and s the source function. Substituting the discretization form of the 
derivatives at each reference node into the governing equation, we obtain

The unknown point can be interpolated by the relative points, and the derivative of each relative point 
can be approximated by the local supporting point within the dashed line. 
 
(I) With the field gradient 
First, consider that there is an arbitrary point of unknown field value and NR relative 
points which are chosen as the first NR nearest points with given data. The square 
with index k and the solid circles in Fig. 3.2 are denoted as the unknown point and the 
relative points, respectively. Next, according to the definition of the LRBF-DQ, the 
field gradient of the relative points can be approximated by Eq. (3.3) with a set of 
local supporting nodes. For example, as shown in Fig. 3.2, the circles enclosed by the 
dashed line are the supporting nodes for relative point 2 (without the inclusion of the 
unknown point). In is noted that the distribution of the local supporting nodes for each 
relative points are in general different. Now, consider the unknown point k as an 
additional supporting node in the formulation of the LRBF-DQ. The gradient at 
relative point 2 is expressed as

system as

3.3. Results 
To demonstrate the capability of the presented interpolation techniques, a set of 
sparsely distributed nodes with given data are used to interpolate the unknown field 
value of another denser mesh in the same domain. The given data are obtained from 
the exact solution of the Poisson equation or the advection-diffusion equation. In 
method (I), the field gradient in x-, y- and z-directions are employed separately for 
interpolation and are denoted as method (I)-x, (I)-y and (I)-z, respectively. The 
performances of the current methods are compared with the conventional ones, 
including the linear polynomial fitting (LPF) method and the quadratic polynomial 
fitting (QPF) method. The algorithms of the aforementioned interpolation methods are 
shown in Table 3.1.

where M is the number of the unknown points. Diminishing error with increasing 
number of data points is observed for each case. The results by the present 
interpolation methods all show better accuracy than those by either the LPF or the 
QPF method. In particular, the results by method (II) and (III) are even better than 
those by method (I). Since the results may be over-estimated when violently varying 
field gradient is adopted for interpolation.  
From Table 3.2, method (III) seems to provide a more reliable solution, thus the error 
analysis under different numbers of the relative points, NR, and the local support 
nodes, NL, are shown in Fig. 3.7. The number of the local support knots and the 
relative points range from 9 to 15 and 6 to 10, respectively. In general, the error 
diminishes with increasing NL when NL is below 12 and increases with larger NL. In 
the formulation of method (III), both the field gradient and the governing equation are 
considered, thus if high order derivative is contained in the governing equation such 
as the second order derivative in the Poison equation, unstable results may occur 
when inappropriate local supporting nodes are employed. Nevertheless, too many 
supporting nodes such as NL = 15 may pollute the results. Moreover, the adequate 
quantities of relative points and data points are also essential to obtain more stable 
inclination of decreasing error with increasing NL.

Although the result by method (I)-z is the most accurate among all the methods in this 
case due the characteristic of the temperature distribution, method (III) is considered as 
the most general interpolation approach with reliable accuracy. The error analysis of 
method (III) with different NR and NL are shown in Fig. 3.11. The testing NL ranges 
from 9 to 20 and NR is tested from 6 to 10. In general, diminishing error with increasing 
local supporting nodes can be observed.  Feasible number of local supporting knots, 
ranges from 14 to 18 in this case, can give good accuracy. The number of the relative 
point seems to provide minor contribution to the result.

邀遠赴加拿大、葡萄牙以及土耳其等國家發表演說，可見研究成果備受國際肯定
之程度。 
Sound and Vibration, Journal of Marine Science and Technology and Journal of Fluid 
Mechanics. The first and second conferences are very big international conferences 
and we are very honor to be invited to present our papers to the global international 
scholars. Thanks to the NSC supports, we thereby were able to make those three 
expensive trips possible. It is recommended that NSC should support more distinguish 
scholars to present their research results to the international communities through the 
participation of important international conferences.
