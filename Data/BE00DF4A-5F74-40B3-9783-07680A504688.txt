Abstract 
The project develops an automatic 
pneumatic-controlled centrifugal microfluidic 
inspection platform for defecting real-time 
biomedical reaction induced fluorescence. 
Organic phosphate examination in vegetables, 
plants and herbal medicines as well as human 
body fluids, have been taken and analyzed using 
the system. The fluorescence inspection with an 
array-sensed structure upon the special designed 
microfluidic disc provides high efficiency 
function of mixing, separation, order injection, 
buffering, screening, samples cultivation and 
concentration detection. A microfluidic 
sensing-array combined with a signal processing 
module has developed to detect dim resonance 
fluorescence produced from standard 
biochemical samples. The pneumatic-controlled 
centrifugal microfluidic inspection platform can 
separate liquid samples to different detecting 
wells accurately. Standard detection procedures 
and an experimental database induced 
fluorescence have been set up and calibrated by 
organic phosphate standards. The measurement 
sensitivity of Chlorpyrifos is 0.711 V/ppm in the 
range of 0.6 to 10 ppm, and the sensitivity of 
Fenitrothion is 0.310 V/ppm in the range of 0.06 
to 10 ppm.

二、緣由與目的 
行政院主計處公佈統計資料顯示，民國
九十八年，國內生產毛額在農業部分產值約
為 1950 億，所使用農藥以防治病蟲害的數量
非常大，因此使用農藥時的人身安全維護應
特別重視。近年來國人生活品質提升，對於
食品安全的重視與日俱增，特別是對平日大
量食用的蔬果，其殘餘農藥的種類與含量，
是大眾矚目的焦點。隨著半導體與微機電技
3 
發光檢測系統以 Luminol-Hydrogen peroxide 
為主要反應機制，以有機磷陶斯松為例，有
機磷農藥與 H2O2 氧化反應後， 產生不穩定
的膦酸鹽化合物(Peroxophosphonate)，反應如
(4)式所示，同時 Luminol 藉由 H2O2 氧化劑
氧 化 ， 分 解 釋 出 氮 氣 形 成 激 態 分 子
(3-aminophthalate)，與不穩定之膦酸鹽化合物
反應，函速產生激態物質，如(5)式所示，最
後激態物質回到基態並釋放出波長為 425 nm
的螢光，再以感測器測得光強度變化，如(6)
式所示[15]。

3.1離心驅動平台控制 
系統驅動方式分別為循跡模式與離心驅
動模式，完整的離心驅動平台電路如圖一所
示。離心力驅動源採用愛德利科技公司的工
業無刷直流馬達(AM-180H)，馬達無負載運轉
可達 6000 rpm，馬達體積與重量小，有利於
平台架構小型化的配置；利用外部控制電路
連結馬達控制器，改變外部輸入埠電位進行
馬達轉速之調變，以數位式可調電位計(Atml 
AD8403)為馬達控制器所需的外部輸入源，透
過串列式二進位編碼將 AD8403-10kΩ的可變
電阻分為 0~255 階，利用人機控制介面，透
過單晶片(89S51)輸出轉速控制，以調變控制
馬達的轉速。選擇強扭力之步進馬達作為微
流道取像之循跡角度的驅動源，設計當步進
馬達主軸驅動一步(1.8°)時，可帶動主軸負載
片轉動 1°，亦即 CCD 取像裝置的循跡角度同
步轉動 1°，不同尺寸軸承於步進馬達與驅動
馬達的主軸上，當步進馬達驅動 200 步時，
帶動負載片轉動一圈(360°)，設計驅動主軸之
外徑為 38 mm，可求得循跡主軸外徑約為 21.1 
mm。同時為能確保系統兩種驅動模式不會相
互動帶，造成馬達的損壞，分別在離心驅動
馬達與循跡步進馬達軸心函裝單向軸承，可
確保馬達正常驅動。  
 
3.2 多工螢光檢測電路設計 
螢光檢測電路方塊圖與信號趨勢如圖二
所示，待測物反應之螢光訊號以光二極體(PD, 
Hamamatsu, S1133)感測，有效感測面積
2.4×2.8 mm
2，檢測波長範圍 320~730 nm，可
量測光強度 10-4~104 Lux，適於量測 Luminol
螢光響應波長 425 nm。由信號控制與處理電
路先取得實驗背景訊號，如圖二(I)所示，再由
峰值保持電路量測，取得量測腔體的背景訊
號(初始訊號)，如圖二(II)所示；待測微流與
Luminol 檢測機制反應，由光二極體擷取螢光
反應的時變信號，如圖二(III)所示；時變響應
信號經由峰值保持電路取得響應訊號，如圖
二(IV)所示；再經由減法電路處理最大螢光反
應訊號和初始背景訊號差值，得到淨螢光響
應強度，如圖二(V)所示。此方法藉由峰值保
持電路取得每次反應所產生的最大值，不受
操作環境與人員差異影響，也不受反應時差
與不完全反應暫態誤差信號影響，解決微流
螢光響應不穩定的問題。 
    多工螢光感測電路設計如圖三，以兩組
螢光峰值保持電路組成，方塊(I)為光電轉換單
元，由 PD處理螢光響應之電訊號轉換(O/E)，
訊號經轉阻放大器將微弱的感應電流，以時
變電壓信號輸出。方塊(II)為背景最大訊號量
測單元，以微處理機(Microchip, PIC16F883)
控制開關電晶體(Q1,Q6)，當 Q1 和 Q6 ON
時，背景信號經耦合電容(C1, C5)進入高通濾
波裝置(C2, C6)，(R6, R21)濾除低頻雜訊，再
經緩衝放大級(A2, A9)進入峰值保持電路。取
樣保持電路均以光耦合器(OC1, OC3)作為保
持開關，並接至微處理機控制，光耦合器(OC1, 
OC3)的啟動時間需控制大於電晶體(Q1,Q6)
的啟動時間，以確保正確背景訊號的擷取。
二極體和電容串接峰值保持電路，二極體的
逆向電流不穩定且受溫度影響；因此，本電
路以 PNP 電晶體(Q2, Q7)代替二極體傳送電
流，降低錯誤訊號，以二極體(D1, D2, D5, D6)
為保護裝置。由於電晶體(Q2, Q7) B極連接緩
衝器(A4, A11)的輸出端，當背景信號由 A3、
A10流進 Q2, Q7 E 極時，緩衝器(A4, A11)之
虛短路特性使 Q2, Q7 之 BC 極電壓降趨近於
零，Q2、Q7 ON及 Q3、Q8 OFF使背景電壓
5 
合有機磷檢測，得到較佳的響應，以有機磷
標準液檢測比較三種微流結構的螢光動態響
應，如圖十所示。量測結果顯示試劑於各結
構的響應時間及螢光響應電壓值不同。滯流
彎道微流結構之螢光檢測顯示最佳反應過
程，峰值反應最快，響應電壓最大，且暫態
與後續不完全反應少。因此，樣品的螢光量
測響應優於其他微流結構，可縮短總響應時
間且具有最佳的電壓響應值，可應用生化檢
測陣列，有效地增函檢測效率。 
 
3.6 校正量測響應 
 利用藍光LED進行多工螢光感測電路之
可行性模擬測試，首先LED距離進行距離相關
性測試，光源與感測距離越遠時，測量到的
光電壓相對降低，如圖十一所示。利用照度
計驗證顯示距離增函使照度(Illuminance, Lux)
降低，如圖十二所示。 
光源與光感測器距離越近時，感測信號
越強。固定光源及光感測器距離0.5 cm，進行
亮度相關性測試，以1 mA電流為量測增幅，
光源亮度越亮，光電壓相對上升，如圖十三
所示。光驅電流與亮度成正比關係，如圖十
四所示。光感測器光電壓與亮度響應之關
係，如圖十五所示。相關校正曲線可應用於
螢光訊號檢測，快速得知其檢測訊號照度，
精確得知待測物的濃度。 
 
3.7 有機磷濃度測試 
有機磷農藥殘留檢測分析前，需先行建
立標準液稀釋的量測。以有機磷陶斯松與撲
滅松標準品分別配置成0-10 ppm的濃度。 
有機磷在 Luminol-H2O2 螢光檢測系統為
增強型反應，螢光電路量測結果顯示於圖十
六與圖十七，陶斯松 10 ppm 有 4.12 V 的響
應，最低可檢測濃度 0.6 ppm 有 1.81V 的響
應。而撲滅松 10 ppm 有 2.45 V的響應，最低
可檢測濃度 0.06 ppm。 
根據農藥使用說明與行政院農業委員會
提供的農藥稀釋倍數及用藥量對照表，40.8%
陶斯松乳劑與 50%撲滅松乳劑最少需要稀釋
1000倍，稀釋噴灑農作物的濃度為 4 ppm 與 
5 ppm。農藥對應防治病蟲害與適用作物之安
全容許殘留極限，陶斯松與撲滅松分別為
0.5-2 ppm 與 0.3-0.5 ppm，均在本系統可應用
於有機磷快速檢測分析之範圍。 
 
四、研究成果自評 
本自動化陣列式螢光即時量測系統對生
物體有機磷快速檢測分析研究已完成，成果
已達到計畫書預期目標。完成訓練碩士班研
究生 7 人，大學專題生 6 人。系統以簡易、
快速、低成本的考量構建整個檢測系統，以
精準微機電的技術製作微流碟片，改善微流
道結構效能與樣品試液的檢測可靠度，另外
設計混合微流結構，增函混合效率，減少反
應時間，可應用於多樣化試液的檢測與分
析。相關研究成果已投稿第二十屆自動化科
技研討會與 2012 年機械工程研討會，並已發
表 SCI 期凼論文一篇於 Journal of Biobased 
Materials and Bioenergy。 
 
五、結論 
本陣列式螢光即時檢測有機磷平台已研
製完成。模擬設計微流結構，增函击塊混合
槽，利用滯流彎道控制試劑於混合槽時間，
增函試劑混合效果，半同心矩形狀溝槽之檢
測槽，有效集中試劑的流向增函試劑作用與
檢測效率，提高檢測的時間響應與準確性。
比較流動注射檢測法，本離心檢測法以固定
突破頻率均勻混流，避免注射不一致產生不
準確的檢測缺失。使用光二極體為光感測元
件，具有體積小、成本低、高整合效率等優
點。陶斯松與撲滅松之感測靈敏度分別為
0.711 V/ppm 和 0.310 V/ppm。本多工生化檢
測系統陣列，可應用於食品相關產業，作為
輔助生醫食品製造成分之監控與含量測定。

Abstract 
In this study, an optoelectromechanical centrifugal-and-fluorescence microfluidic detection system with wireless 
transmission function is developed for measuring real-time tannic acid concentration based on the chemiluminescent 
and extinction reaction between tannic acid and luminal, oxidant and catalyst. The voltage response of fluorescence 
intensity detection has been experimented. The fluorescence intensity decreases by increasing concentration of tannic 
acid. Dynamic measurements show that the higher the concentration of tannic acid is, the shorter the reaction rise time 
and the longer the restored time have. The concentration of catalyst CuCl2 in 10
-4
 mol/l can provide optimal tannic 
acid detection for the concentration below 8×10
-2
 mol/l. Two segments linear approximation for calculating tannic acid 
concentration by measuring voltage is proposed. The sensitivities of -2616 mV/mol/l and -187 mV/mol/l are found to 
detect tannic acid concentration for the concentration below 1.07×10
-2
 mol/l and for the concentration between 
1.07×10
-2
 and 8×10
-2
 mol/l, respectively. The advantages of the tannic acid detection method are low-cost, high 
sensitivity, less sample required, real-time inspection and rapid response as well as high accuracy to promise that the 
method can be applied in measuring tannic acid concentration of agriculture, food and medicine. 
Keywords: Centrifugal microfluid platform, Tannic acid concentration analysis, Centrifugal-and- fluorescence 
detection, Microstructures, Chemiluminescent and extinction reaction 
1. Introduction 
To determine the ingredients of medicines and foods rapidly and accurately becomes important issues for 
improving modern life quality. Tannic acid is a naturally compounds of phenol found on some cuticles of fruit and tea 
plants that can affect food taste. It is also an important substance because it can precipitate protein to protect ulcer 
organizations of skin and mucous membrane by coagulating protein to converge skin surface. Tannic acid is an 
important ingredient of the water-insoluble methicillin by prescribing tannic acid with metals and alkaloids glycosides 
to resistand heal aureus, streptococcus, streptococcus pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, to analyze 
tannic acid concentration rapidly and accurately becomes the leading issue of researches. By improving traditional 
large-scale expensive and complicated measurement system, a multi-functional small detection system with 
visualization monitoring has been developed to analyze biochemical reactions using real-time quasi-static 
centrifugal-and-fluorescence microfluidic technology.
1-2
 The methods of flow injection, titration and 
spectrophotometry have been used to detect tannic acid.
3-5
 The capillary electrophoresis structures have been 
combined with chemiluminescent materials of luminol-Cu(II) or luminol-K3Fe(CN)6-OH to detect concentrations of 
green tea catechin and tannic acid for monitoring environmental water pollution from breweries and tanneries.
6-9
 In the 
study, a quasi-static real-time centrifugal-and-fluorescence microfluidic detection system with flexible microflow 
platforms has developed to analyze concentration of tannic acid speedily and correctly using tiny samples. 
2. Operation principle 
The operation system monitored by real-time human-machine interface is based on the hydrophobic and 
capillary effective microfluidic platform on a pneumatic-and-centrifugal controlled detection system. Varied speeds of 
the motor produced centrifugal forces to drive sample flows move into assigned reaction reservoirs. The centrifugal 
force is proportional to the channel diameter, the length difference and length average of flow paths, and the square of 
angular velocity. The location of microvalve determines the initial frequency of the platform rotation, it called the 
threshold frequency constrained the type of the sample movement. The microflow rate can be controlled by designing 
contact angle of the liquid-solid surface. 
The solution combination of luminol, alkaline, hydrogen peroxide and catalyst is used to detect tannic acid 
concentration based on the chemiluminescent and extinction reaction. Different oxidants and catalysts influence 
luminous efficiency of the chemiluminescent reaction. Luminol reacted with H2O2 in strong alkaline solution (pH 8-11) 
produce free radicals and nitrogen that combine with suitable catalyst’s metal ions to form 3-aminophthalate (3-APA *) 
in excited state. The excited 3-APA * will return to ground state and release chemiluminescent energy shown as 
Fig. 1.

 The concentration  of tannic acid can be measured by reacting with chemiluminescent and  extinction 
 10 
an intelligent human-machine interface as shown in Fig. 3. Based on quasi-static technology, the optical sensor and the 
reaction reservoir have same rotational speed that is aligned by a tracking motor. The optical sensor takes real-time 
microfluid fluorescence response and transmits to computer via Bluetooth wireless module. The centrifugal 
microfluidic structures are located on different radial sites with varied threshold frequencies controlled by variable 
motor speeds. A succession of tannic acid-and-luminol fluorescence reactions on a centrifugal microfluidic detection 
platform are shown in Fig. 3. Two input reservoirs with diameter of 5 mm and depth of 0.5 mm are injected test liquid 
samples of luminol/H2O2 and CuCl2/tannic acid respectively. When the centrifugal platform rotates at 350 rpm, these 
samples are breakthrough the microvalves into the reaction reservoir of 2.5×2.5 mm

to be detected.

4. Measurements and discussions 
4.1 Catalyst enhanced response 
The tannic acid concentration related largest fluorescence reaction is detected by measuring equivalent voltage 
output. The chemiluminescent and extinction reactions are dependent on operation temperature and catalyst (CuCl2) 
concentration. Experimental results are analyzed and shown in Fig. 4. It shows that CuCl2 concentration of 
1×10
-4
 mol/l at 50 ℃  provides optimal sensitivity to measure tannic acid concentration. Increasing CuCl2 
concentration will reduce measurable range of tannic acid concentration. When CuCl2 concentration exceeds 
2.0×10
-4
 mol/l, the measurable range of tannic acid concentration is constricted only below 3.38×10

 mol/l and 10

 mol/l interval is taken for the 
concentration from 1 to 8×10

 mol/l. The experiments show that the higher the tannic acid concentration is, the lower 
the response voltage is that is shown in Fig. 5. The response curve is processed by the method of piecewise linear 
approximation. Two sensitivities of tannic acid concentration are -26216 mV/mol/l and -187 mV/mol/l related to the 
concentration below 1.07×10

tannin concentration is, the lower the fluorescence intensity produces.  
 
3. Dynamic microfluidic fluorescence detection  
3.1 Fluorescence detection circuitry 
A photodiode (PD, Hamamatsu, S1133) is used as the photo detector with the characteristics of detectable 
wavelength between 320 and 730 nm, effective sensing area of 2.4×2.8 mm
2
, and sensing light intensity between 10
4 
and 10
-4
 Lux to detect tannin reacted fluorescence in wavelength of 425 nm. A block diagram of fluorescence sensing 
circuitry is shown in Fig. 1. PDs detect initial background signal and chemiluminescent fluorescence signal. The 
detected signal transmits to the peak-and-hold circuit and the subtraction circuit to catch the largest signal of 
fluorescence response for obtaining equivalent tannin concentration. The method prevents improper signal from 
unstable chemiluminescent reaction and environmental noise. The developed system can detect the largest signal 
accurately from fluorescence response to eliminate the unstable biochemical reactions and reduce the environmental 
disturbances. 
 
Fig. 1. The block diagram of fluorescence measurement circuitry that can detect and hold the peak signal in the 
chemiluminescence and extinction response 
The detector sensed analog signal converts to digital signal by an A/D converter (National, ADC0804) and 
transmits to a microcontroller (Atmel, 89S51) and a human-machine interface to monitor the fluorescence reaction via 
a Bluetooth wireless communication unit with the baud rate of 9600. The frequency of ADC0804 is 606 kHz which 
takes 64 cycles of 105 μs to convert 8-bit A/D signal. Therefore, a delay time of 200 μs is set to complete analog to 
digital conversion. The dynamic microfluid centrifugal-and-fluorescence reaction is monitored and analyzed 
automatically in real-time during full photoelectric response. 
 
3.2 Design of Dynamic detection platform 
To detect tannin concentration accurately and rapidly, a dynamic centrifugal-and-fluorescence microfluidic 
detection system as shown in Fig 2 is developed by integrating fluorescence detection units, time-varied photoelectric 
signal sensing circuits, a Bluetooth wireless transmission module, and an intelligent human-machine interface. 
Dynamic signal can be measured as stationary condition based on novel quasi-static design by aligning optical sensor 
with reacting microfluidic structures to keep relative motion in the rest. Different microvolves located on different 
radial positions to have different threshold frequencies are designed and controlled by different motor speeds that 
make microflow move to arranged paths at set time for inspecting tannin chemiluminescent reaction. The PD sensed 
real-time fluorescence signal is processed by the peak-and-hold circuit to catch the largest reaction signal and then 
transmits to the computer interface via Bluetooth module to analyze tannin concentration. 
 
4. Measurement and Discussion 
4.1 Experimental samples preparation 
The crude Gall has been ground to about 1 mm diameter powder for extracting tannin concentration precisely as 
 16 
 
Fig. 4. Fluorescence equivalent voltage response versus soaked time with temperatures as parameters to measure 
tannin concentration 
4.3 Tannin concentration measurement 
The experimental solutions for detecting tannin concentration are prepared in six beakers by mixing 1 gram 
crude Gall powder with 100 cc deionized water at 50 ℃ and obtaining in succession by an interval of 5 minutes from 
the soaked Gall solution. For samples stability sake, it must keep a constant volume of Gall solution during the 
sampling period. The soaked Gall solutions are injected to the centrifugal-and-fluorescence microfluidic detection 
platforms for dynamic tannin concentration detection. Time-varied tannin concentration of crude Gall is shown in Fig. 
5. The longer the immersion time is, the denser the tannin concentration releases. The time-varied tannin concentration 
slope of 1.4×10
-3
 mol/l/min shows a linear release rate when the soaked time is less than 30 minutes. A small slope of 
1.22×10
-5 
mol/l/min has observed to show low release rate of tannin concentration when soaked time is between 12 
and 48 hours. When soaked time is longer than 48 hours, the released tannin concentration approaches the saturation 
of 7.32×10
-2
 mol/l. 
   
Fig. 5. Time-varied tannin concentration response of crude Gall, left shows linear release rate for soaked time less 30 
minutes, right shows low release rate and the approach of saturation for long soaked time 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, tannin concentration extracted from the crude Gall powder is performed by measure luminol-based 
chemiluminescence and extinction response by using a real-time dynamic centrifugal- and-fluorescence microfluidic 
detection system with wireless transmission function. The largest fluorescent signal is sensed in the wavelength of 425 
nm by using selected photodiode and designed peak-and-hold circuit. Experimental results show that the higher 
soaked temperature and the longer soak time set, the higher tannin concentration release. Equal release rate of tannin 
concentration is observed at temperature 50 ℃ and 100 ℃ that are doubled than operation at temperature of 25 ℃. 
The tannin concentration extracts from crude Gall powder with a constant rate of 1.4×10

 mol/l/min     in early 
time and when soaked time is longer than 48 hours the release of tannin concentration approaches the saturated

concentration and the resistance. Because the gas to be measured and the semiconducting metal 
oxide have different work functions, the contact junction electrons flow from the low work 
function to the high work function. After balanced, the energy band bends on the surface. The 
main cause for the resistance change of metal-oxide gas sensor is that the metal oxide adsorbs or 
desorbs atmospheric oxygen, and reacts with metal oxide surface. The electronic affinity of 
oxidizing gases (e.g. O2, NOx) is greater than the work function of semiconducting metal oxide. 
The oxidizing gas obtains conduction electrons, anion adsorption is formed, and the conduction 
band free electron concentration is reduced, so that the conductivity decreases and the resistance 
rises. The electronic affinity of reducing gas (e.g. CO, NH3) sensor is smaller than the work 
function of semiconducting metal oxide. The conduction band of semiconducting metal oxide 
gathers a large number of electrons. The increased free electron concentration of the conduction 
band causes the conductivity to increase and the resistance to decrease.  
The n-type WO3 based gas sensor can adsorb oxygen atoms onto the WO3 surface to form 
O2(ads). As the electronic affinity of physically adsorbed oxygen molecules is greater than the work 
function of WO3, the free electrons of material form exothermic reaction chemosorption. If the 
metal oxide surface has reducing gas reacting with oxyanions on the absorption surface, resulting 
in oxyanion desorption, the electrons taken away by oxygen return into the material again, and the 
electrical resistance of material is reduced. 
                      
3. Design and fabrication  
 
3.1 Anodic treatment processes 
The porous anodic aluminum oxide equipment is shown in Fig. 1. First, 0.3 M oxalic acid 
electrolyte was placed into a thermal-isolated glass container. The electrolyte temperature was set 
to keep at 10 ℃ by the cooling water circulation system. The electromagnetic stirrer was used to 
maintain the electrolyte temperature and the uniformity of concentration. In the process of 
removing alumina and bore expanding, the mixed liquor of 2wt% chromic acid and 5 wt% 
phosphoric acid was used. The system cathode was not required in the oxidation reaction. Stable 
graphite rod was used as the electrode, and the aluminum sample was fixed to the carrier as the 
anode. The current signal capturer was designed, and Visual Basic was used to program the 
man-machine interface to complete the real-time AAO current monitoring system. The 
completeness of AAO can be observed to guarantee the growth.  
 
3.2 Design of AAO-based microsensor  
The gas microsensor used silicon wafer as substrate, the sensing membrane of WO3 with 
better selectivity was used for sensing CO gas. AAO structure was grown to enlarge the sensing 
area to enhance surface chemical reaction. The Pt was used as sensing electrode, the surface 
catalysis effect is enhanced, and the gas sensing sensitivity is improved. This microsensor had a 
built-in heater to maintain the sensor at better working temperature, providing the required energy 
for chemical reaction, accelerating the reaction. The heater and the temperature sensor were 
integrated into the same process to reduce the process cost and procedure. The heater pattern was 
round, so that the temperature was distributed on the sensing surface uniformly. The substrate of 
this sensor was n-type, <100> silicon wafer, and processes including lithography, coating by 
vaporization, sputtering, isotropic etching, and anodic treatment. The processes are shown in Fig.

band causes the conductivity to increase and the resistance to decrease.  
The n-type WO3 based gas sensor can adsorb oxygen atoms onto the WO3 surface to form 
O2(ads). As the electronic affinity of physically adsorbed oxygen molecules is greater than the work 
function of WO3, the free electrons of material form exothermic reaction chemosorption. If the 
metal oxide surface has reducing gas reacting with oxyanions on the absorption surface, resulting 
in oxyanion desorption, the electrons taken away by oxygen return into the material again, and the 
electrical resistance of material is reduced. 
                      
8. Design and fabrication  
 
3.3 Anodic treatment processes 
The porous anodic aluminum oxide equipment is shown in Fig. 1. First, 0.3 M oxalic acid 
electrolyte was placed into a thermal-isolated glass container. The electrolyte temperature was set 
to keep at 10 ℃ by the cooling water circulation system. The electromagnetic stirrer was used to 
maintain the electrolyte temperature and the uniformity of concentration. In the process of 
removing alumina and bore expanding, the mixed liquor of 2wt% chromic acid and 5 wt% 
phosphoric acid was used. The system cathode was not required in the oxidation reaction. Stable 
graphite rod was used as the electrode, and the aluminum sample was fixed to the carrier as the 
anode. The current signal capturer was designed, and Visual Basic was used to program the 
man-machine interface to complete the real-time AAO current monitoring system. The 
completeness of AAO can be observed to guarantee the growth.  
 
3.4 Design of AAO-based microsensor  
The gas microsensor used silicon wafer as substrate, the sensing membrane of WO3 with 
better selectivity was used for sensing CO gas. AAO structure was grown to enlarge the sensing 
area to enhance surface chemical reaction. The Pt was used as sensing electrode, the surface 
catalysis effect is enhanced, and the gas sensing sensitivity is improved. This microsensor had a 
built-in heater to maintain the sensor at better working temperature, providing the required energy 
for chemical reaction, accelerating the reaction. The heater and the temperature sensor were 
integrated into the same process to reduce the process cost and procedure. The heater pattern was 
round, so that the temperature was distributed on the sensing surface uniformly. The substrate of 
this sensor was n-type, <100> silicon wafer, and processes including lithography, coating by 
vaporization, sputtering, isotropic etching, and anodic treatment. The processes are shown in Fig.

4.1 Heat characteristic analysis  
The heater was biased in the seal cavity. The temperature measuring instrument (Centet, 309) 
and infrared thermal imager (Avid, TVS-200EX) were used to observe the temperature response. 
Fig. 5 shows the thermal temperature responses of heating voltages. When the supplied voltage 
was 120 V, the heater temperature in the confined sensing space was 296 ℃. The temperature was 
distributed over the microsensor uniformly.

4.4 Microsensor temperature characteristic 
In the experiment of hot resistance temperature effect of microsensor, the temperature 
measuring instrument was used to measure the center point temperature of the component, and the 
digital multimeter (Gwinstek, GDM-8245) was used to measure the temperature of sensor 
platinum metal resistance of microsesors. The sensitivity of temperature sensor was then analyzed. 
The result showed that the resistance change was linearly related to the temperature change, and 
the sensitivity was 2.21 Ω/℃.  
 
4.5 Microsensor characteristic  
The normalized gas sensing response was defined as the ratio of the electrical resistance 
change rate before the test gas was filled to that after the test gas was filled. CO and N2 were 
mixed to adjust the test gas concentration. When the gas was stabilized, the electrical resistance of 
sample was measured. The experimental measurement system is shown in Fig. 6, where nitrogen

10. Conclusions 
This study produced a gas microsensor containing nano-AAO structures, and implemented 
multi-functional sensing structure and measured the response characteristics. The nano porous 
structure enlarged the sensing area of tungsten oxide membrane and the gas to be measured, so 
that the impedance changes of the sensor adsorbed gas were more obvious, and the sensitivity was 
improved. The local temperature of sensing area can be heated to 296 ℃ by 120 V driving voltage. 
Theresponse of temperature sensor was linear, and the sensitivity was 2.21 Ω/℃. The optimum 
operating temperature of gas microsensor was 200 ℃, the measured CO gas concentration was 
100 ~ 1000 ppm, and the resistance change rate was 97.1 % ~ 52.4 %. As compared with the 
sensor without AAO, the resistance change rate sensed by this microsensor increased by 87.4 %. 
The sensing response time and recovery time were 6 and 9 min, respectively.
