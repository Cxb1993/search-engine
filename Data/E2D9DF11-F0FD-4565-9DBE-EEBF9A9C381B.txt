Because the MRC scheme cannot achieve satisfactory

multiuser detectors were proposed to further process 
the despreader output for performance improvement 
[4]-[7]. In the next section, we will review PPIC and 
one of its improved versions, called VRPPIC. Also, an 
OWF selection algorithm for VRPPIC will be 
presented for further performance enhancement.

MAI estimates, ( )mβ  is the weighting factor, and ( )mhp  
contains the hard decisions corresponding to ( )msp  of 
the mth IC stage, respectively. The PPIC detector 
improves the system performance by removing a part 
of MAI estimates from the despreaded signal with a 
weighting factor ( )mβ  at the mth IC stage and adding 
the soft decisions from the previous IC stage for 
compensation with a weighting factor ( )(1 )mβ− . The 
weighting factor ( )mβ  depends on the reliability of 
signal estimates and the amount of MAI at each IC 
stage, which usually has the relationship as follows: 
           (1) (2) ( )0 ... 1Mβ β β< ≤ ≤ ≤ <               (5) 
since more reliable MAI estimates can be obtained at 
later IC stages in the PPIC detector. 
3.2.1.2 The VRPPIC detector 
To further improve the system performance, Wang 
and Wu proposed a bit estimator to linearly combine 
the soft decisions at each IC stage of PPIC [7]. This 
improved version of PPIC is called VRPPIC and its 
operations are written by

VRPPIC detector has weighting factors to be 
determined. In the following subsection, we will derive 
a conditional variance function from the VRPPIC 
operations and use it to find the OWFs. 
3.2.2   AN OWF SELECTION ALGORITHM 
3.2.2.1 The conditional variance function based on 
VRPPIC 
The conditional variance function of the final signal 
estimates s  of VRPPIC is derived with the following 
assumptions and notations: 
(A.1) The channel matrix H is known, i.e., with 
perfect channel estimation. 
(A.2) The elements of the diagonal amplitude matrix 
A are all the same and given, i.e., with perfect 
power control. 
(A.3) Quadriphase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation 
is used for data sources. 
(A.4) ( )ˆ, , and each mcs w i  are mutually independent.

var[ ]• : the variance operation for a random variable  
wc: the AWGN term corresponding to the desired 
user  
( )ˆ mi : the MAI estimate at the mth IC stage 
corresponding to the desired user 
The conditional variance function according to the 
VRPPIC operations can be derived as given in (7) and 
the corresponding representation for the desired user is 
written in (8). It is easy to see that the conditional 
variance in (8) is a function of all the weighting factors. 
scheme. All the simulations were performed in a 
multipath Rayleigh fading channel with 4 paths for 
each user, where perfect channel estimation, power 
control, and no channel coding were assumed. The 
channel was assumed to be quasi-static, i.e., having 
constant impulse response and no Doppler shift during 
every burst transmission. QPSK modulation was used 
for data sources, and random PN codes were assigned 
for each user to spread the modulated signals in the 
frequency domain. The spreading factor was assumed 
to be N=64, which is equal to the number of subcarriers. 
To make a fair performance comparison, two cases of 
system loading were considered; one with 40 active 
users and the other with 60 active users, i.e., K=40, 60. 
Figs. 1 and 2 show the simulation results of the 
VRPPIC detectors for different weighting factor 
selection schemes and different system loading 
environments, where (1)Gβ  is set to be 0.646 and 0.5375, 
respectively. These figures illustrate that the VRPPIC 
detector with the proposed OWFs has a performance 
gain over that with randomly selected weighting factors, 
especially in high SNR scenarios. 
四、計畫成果自評 
In this report, we have proposed an OWF selection 
algorithm for VRPPIC in MC-CDMA uplink systems, 
where a monotonically increasing conditional variance 
function derived from the VRPPIC operations is 
minimized subject to a given weighting factor for the 
first IC stage. Without complicated BER analysis, it is 
easy to determine the OWFs for all the IC stages of 
VRPPIC, and they are just equal. Computer simulation 
results have also demonstrated that the proposed OWF 
selection algorithm can enhance the performance in 
different system loading scenarios. Part of this work 
was presented at the 2007 IEEE Wireless 
Communications and Networking Conference (IEEE 
WCNC 2007), Hong Kong, Mar. 2007. In addition to 
the OWF selection algorithm, we have also proposed a 
simple method of selecting the partial cancellation 
factor for the first stage of a hard-decision partial 
parallel interference cancellation detector for CDMA 
systems, which has been accepted for publication in the 
IEEE Communications Letters, and a low-complexity 
adaptive decision feedback equalization scheme for 
unique word based single carrier systems, which has 
been submitted to Globecom 2007 for publication. 
五、附錄 
In this Appendix, we first prove that the noise part of 
the conditional variance function in (8) is 
monotonically increasing with the final weighting 
factor ( )Mβ ; the detailed derivation is described in 
(AP.1). Then, with the definition of 
( 1)( )ˆ [ ( )] mm H H −−e e e e hi H H diag H H Ap  given after (4) 
and the assumptions of (A.1), (A.2), and (A.3), we 
obtain (1) (2) ( )ˆ ˆ ˆvar[ ] var[ ] ... var[ ]Mi i i= = = ; with this 
result, we can rewrite the MAI part of the conditional 
variance function in (8) as shown by (AP.2). Moreover, 
excluding the first and second terms, the MAI part in 
(AP.2) decreases very fast; accordingly, we can easily 
prove that the MAI part is also monotonically 
increasing with the final weighting factor ( )Mβ , where 
the corresponding derivation is shown in (AP.3). With 
(AP.1) and (AP.3), we can conclude that the 
conditional variance function in (8) is monotonically 
increasing with the final weighting factor ( )Mβ .

in [9]. The effect of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) 
is temporarily dropped for clarity. 
A. The Training Sequence Structure 
The training sequence is composed of an orthogonal 
sequence attached by both cyclic prefix and postfix as depicted 
in Fig. 1. A sequence is called orthogonal if and only if its 
autocorrelation function is a delta function. Let gP=[g(0), 
g(1), …, g(P−1)] denote the orthogonal sequence, and 
g(n)=g(n+P) for n=−M, −M+1, …, P−M−1 represent the cyclic 
extensions. Both the lengths of the cyclic extensions are chosen 
to be longer than the number of effective taps of the 
sample-spaced CIR denoted by hL=[h(0), h(1), …, h(L−1)]. 
Since we have M >L−1 and P−M >L−1, the selection of the 
length of the orthogonal sequence will be dependent on the 
number of effective taps of the sample-spaced CIR and must 
satisfy the following inequality 
2( 1).P L> −                                    (1) 
By appending sufficiently long cyclic extensions to the original 
orthogonal sequence, part of the received sequence can be 
modeled as the cyclic convolution of the CIR and the 
orthogonal sequence. It can be expressed as

represents the operation of modulo P. 
Since the autocorrelation between an orthogonal sequence 
and any of its cyclically-shifted versions is zero, the CIR 
information can be obtained by crosscorrelating the received 
training sequence and the original orthogonal sequence.

As we can see, based on the training sequence structure, the 
crosscorrelation function between the received training 
sequence and the original orthogonal sequence will contain a 
segment that perfectly matches the CIR. In addition, this 
desired segment will be guarded by leading and tailing zeros, 
and therefore can be clearly identified.

B. The Joint Time Synchronization and Channel Estimation 
Scheme 
With the special training sequence structure, time 
synchronization and channel estimation can be jointly 
accomplished by the following steps:

value of R(d) within a proper observation range. It locates 
the channel tap with the largest gain. Let ( )max 0  h R d=  
represent the largest channel gain and set a proper ratio α 
where 0 < α < 1. 
(3)  The optimum time synchronization instant (dopt) and the 
CIR are jointly obtained by finding

where D represents the range for time adjustment. 
Since d0 locates the channel tap with the largest gain, the 
parameter D can be chosen to be less than L−1. The parameter 
α represents a pre-defined minimal ratio of the channel’s first 
effective gain to hmax. For each timing instant d (d0−D ≤ d ≤ d0) 
such that the absolute value of R(d) is greater than or equal to 
α·hmax, the timing instant d will be considered to be within the 
desired region where R(d) matches h(d). It should be noted that 
{R(d)} is computed only once in this approach. 
III. THE PROPOSED TRAINING SEQUENCE STRUCTURE FOR 
MIMO SYSTEMS 
In this section, we present the proposed extension of the 
above-mentioned training sequence structure into MIMO 
systems. With the proposed extension, the interference among 
training sequences transmitted by different antennas will be 
eliminated. Furthermore, its special structure enables the 
receiver to perform time synchronization and channel 
estimation towards all transmit-antennas jointly through a 
simple correlator and a comparator. 
A. The MIMO System Model 
Let us consider a MIMO system that is formed by NT 
transmit-antennas and NR receive-antennas. Since each antenna 
will receive signals transmitted from all antennas through 
This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communications Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE GLOBECOM 2006 proceedings.
©1-4244-0357-X/06/$20.00     2006 IEEE
synchronization instant can be estimated jointly through the 
method described in section II-B within each region. 
In MIMO-OFDM systems, however, the effect of carrier 
frequency offset (CFO) should be taken into account. In this 
case, the sequence received by the jth antenna is modeled as 
( ) ( ) ( )2j n Nj j jr n y n e w nπε= ⋅ +                     (9) 
where N represents the number of OFDM subcarriers, ε denotes 
the CFO normalized to the OFDM subcarrier spacing, and w j(n) 
describes the AWGN. It should be noted that the training 
pattern for each transmit-antenna is additionally designed to 
contain two identical halves and each has a length of P. 
Consequently, conventional synchronization techniques for 
OFDM systems that based on time-domain repetition structures 
of the training sequences can be directly applied to perform 
coarse time synchronization and CFO estimation. Once a 
reference time has been obtained from the coarse time 
synchronization process and the effect of the CFO has also been 
properly handled, the received and compensated training 
sequence can be viewed as {yj(n)} garbled by slight residual 
CFO and AWGN. In other word, the above-mentioned 
approach can now be utilized to acquire CIR information of 
different transmit-receive branches along with the 
corresponding time synchronization instants. 
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
During computer simulations, we applied the multipath 
Rayleigh fading channel model described in [10] to generate the 
CIR of each transmit-receive branch independently. Each CIR is 
modeled by complex samples where the average power of them 
decays exponentially. Each of these samples has 
uniformly-distributed phase and Rayleigh-distributed amplitude. 
The CIR of the ijth transmit-receive branch at delay k is 
modeled as

where ( )20,  2kN σ  denotes a zero mean Gaussian random 
variable with variance 2 2kσ , Ts is the sampling period, and 
TRMS is the root-mean-squared delay spread of the channel. By 
setting Ts/TRMS=1/2, the number of effective taps (L) was 
chosen to be 10⋅(TRMS/Ts)=20 to provide the tail of the simulated 
CIR with sufficient decay. In addition, we assumed that each 
transmit-receive branch experienced the same CFO, which is 
uniformly distributed within 1± subcarrier spacing. 
The training sequence structure described in [1] was used 
for both the methods compared [1], [8]. In this training 
structure, the length of each modulatable orthogonal sequence 
was chosen to be 169 and the cyclic prefix attached was fixed to 
87 samples. On the other hand, a different length of the 
modulatable orthogonal sequence was adopted to form the 
proposed training sequence structure with parameters P=256, 
and M=64. In other words, the length of the proposed training 
sequence for each transmit-antenna is fixed to 512 samples, 
while that of the one compared [1] are set to 512 and 768 
samples in the 2×2 and 3×3 cases, respectively. It should be 
noted that the cases denoted by “MIMO” neglect the effect of 
CFO, while the cases denoted by “MIMO-OFDM” follow the 
system model described in (9) and require coarse time 
synchronization and CFO estimation. For the fairness of 
comparison, the coarse time synchronization and CFO 
estimation method described in [1] was adopted for both the 
proposed scheme and the one compared. 
The performance of the proposed joint time 
synchronization and channel estimation scheme and the 
methods compared was evaluated in several aspects. In Fig. 4, 
we can see that the proposed time estimator with different 
values of α performs unbiased when the signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) exceeds 15 dB. Since the proposed scheme acquires 
time and CIR information jointly and therefore is able to 
identify the first tap of the channel even if it’s not the strongest 
one. On the contrary, the estimator compared [1] has significant 
biases that are positive numbers. The biases of the estimator 
compared cannot be reduced by increasing SNR due to the fact 
that the estimator tends to locate the tap with the largest channel 
gain, which is frequently not the first tap but a delayed one. 
According to Fig. 5, we can see that the proposed scheme 
outperforms the method compared by orders. The variances of 
the proposed time estimator for 2×2 and 3×3 MIMO-OFDM 
systems become the same when SNR exceeds 20 dB. Since the 
mutual interference among training sequences transmitted by 
different antennas is eliminated, using more antennas will not 
degrade the performance in high SNR region. When a smaller α 
is used, the proposed estimator may achieve lower variance in 
high SNR region due to its ability to identify the first channel 
tap that is relatively small. On the other hand, a smaller α may 
degrade the estimator accuracy in low SNR region due to noise 
effect. Unlike the proposed scheme, the variances of the 
method compared degrade significantly as the number of 
transmit-antennas increases. It is simply because the mutual 
interference among training sequences increases in 
conventional training sequence structures when more antennas 
are used. 
In Fig. 6, the proposed joint scheme and a scheme that 
combines the synchronization method [1] and the channel 
estimation method [8] were evaluated in terms of the resultant 
mean-squared-error of the corresponding channel estimators. 
As we can see, the proposed joint scheme outperforms the 
combination one due to its ability to refine time 
synchronization results along with the corresponding CIR 
estimates. In the combination scheme, however, the 
frequently-delayed time estimator significantly degrades the 
channel estimation results that followed. It can be justified by 
comparing the results with those obtained in the perfect 
synchronization case. We can also observe that both the 
proposed scheme and the combination one are insensitive to 
residual CFO caused by imperfect estimation. We also noticed 
that the combination scheme with perfect synchronization still 
performed worse than the proposed one in low SNR region. 
Since the channel estimation method described in [8] requires 
pilot tone estimation in frequency-domain, for a training pattern 
that has inconstant amplitudes in frequency-domain, the 
corresponding results will be degraded due to the effect of noise 
enhancement.
