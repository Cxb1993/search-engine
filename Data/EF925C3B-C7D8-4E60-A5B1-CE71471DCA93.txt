Abstract 
Neighborhood system (NS) was introduced in late 80 from database, information retrieval 
and computer security. From the very beginning, the terminology has been adopted from 
topological spaces; some are appropriate, some have over used the analogy. In this research, we 
(re-)define definitively the important concepts and use the proposed NS to define Zadeh’s Granular 
Mathematics (GrM). The main results are: 
 
(1) GrM, though defined locally, can be axiomatized by global concepts. This axiomatization is 
significant, it has completed what Sierpinski had done partially in his book (1952). 
(2) GrM unifies the concepts of rough sets (RS), binary relations, and topological spaces.

3. 文獻探討 
Granular Computing is an emerging conceptual and computing paradigm of information 
processing. Lotfi A. Zadeh [22] first introduced the notion of information granulation in 1979 and 
suggested that fuzzy set theory may find potential applications in this respect. The concept of 
granular computing was initially called information granularity or information granulation in 
Zadeh’s early papers [20-22]. As footnoted by Zadeh in [19], the label “Granular Computing” was 
coined by Tsau Young Lin [7].  
Though the Granular Computing name is relatively recent, the ideas and principles of 
granular computing, have in fact appeared, under different names, in many related fields, such as 
granularity in artificial intelligence, divide and conquer in theoretical computer science, clustering, 
data compression, information hiding and rough set theory, and many others. 
Granular Computing, as defined in the CFP of the 2010 IEEE International Conference on 
Granular Computing (http://xanadu.cs.sjsu.edu/~grc/grc2010/), is a general computation theory for 
effectively using granules such as subsets, neighborhoods, tuples (ordered subsets), relations 
(subsets of Cartesian products), fuzzy sets (membership functions), random variables (measurable 
functions), turing machines (algorithms), and intervals to build an efficient computational model for 
complex applications with huge amounts of data, information and knowledge (see Granular 
Computing Information Center). Though the label is relatively recent, the basic notions and 
principles are quite common, even ancient. For example, granulations of daily objects, such as 
human body, are ancient practices. The infinitesimal that led to the invention of Calculus, are the 
ancient intuition on the granulation of space and time. Heisenburg uncertainty (a neighborhood of 
possible locations) are integral part of modern physics (quantum mechanics). Information hiding in 
programming, divide and conquer in algorithm development are common practices of granular 
computing in computer science. Fuzzy and rough set theories, neutrosophic computing, quotient 
space, belief functions, machine learning, databases, data mining, cluster analysis, interval 
computing, more recently social computing, cloud computing all involve granular computing. 
The study of granular computing as an emerging field appeared in 1997 (Zadeh [91-20], 1997, 
1998; Lin [5-7], 1997, 1998.). In the title of his talk “The Key Roles of Information Granulation and 
Fuzzy Logic in Human Reasoning, Concept Formulation and Computing with Words” at the 1996 
IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, Zadeh stated “Information granulation involves 
partitioning of a class of objects (points) into granules, with a granule being a clump of objects 
(points) drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity, or functionality.” 
Since the phrase “drawn together” implicitly implies certain level of symmetry in the clumps, 
and there are no constraints on how many clumps an object associated, T.Y. Lin [5-6] suggested 
that the above notion of granulation can be rephrased as “Information granulation is a collection of 
granules , with a granule being a clump of objects (points) drawn towards an object. In other words, 
each object is associated a family of clumps”, and pointed out that mathematically, the association 
of each object such a family of clumps is a neighborhood system [8].  
On the other hand, the rough set theory put forward by Zdzislaw Pawlak in his seminal paper 
[16] of 1982 is another important aspect of granular computing. Based on rough set theory, Pawlak

taking neighborhood systems as the primitive undeﬁned concept. We now present an ultimate 
generalization of topology. We will call it neighborhood system (NS); it is a pre-topology in 
the sense it generalizes the topology by dropping the axioms ((1), (2), (3), and (4) of 
Definition 2. 
 
Definition 3. Let NS be a mapping, called a neighborhood system (NS), 
 
NS : U → P(P(U)) , 
 
I n  o t h e r  w o r d s ,  N S  a s s o c i a t e s  e a c h  p o i n t  p  i n  U ,  a  family NS(p) of 
subsets of U .  Such a family of subsets is called a neighborhood system at p .  By 
abuse of language, both the mapping and the collection NS(U) = {NS(p) | p ∈ U } 
will be called a neighborhood system (NS).  
 
• The pair (U, NS(U)) is called a Local/First GrC Model in the Encyclopedia [4]. 
 
Remark. 
(1) Observe the difference between pretopological space and pre-topological space. 
(2) Observe that the NS (p) is a local base; see below. 
(3) Note that NS(p) may  
(i) contain an empty set and other subsets; 
(ii) contain an empty set only, that is, NS(p) = {∅} (singleton); 
(iii) be an empty set, that is, NS(p)= ∅; or equivalently { }. 
 
Deﬁni t ion  4 .  Let U and V be two universes. Le t  NS 1 (U )  =  { NS 1 (p) | p ∈ U } and   
NS 2 (V) = { NS 2 (q) | q ∈ V } be two neighborhood systems on U and V, respectively. A 
mapping  f : U → V  is said to be 
 
(1) continuous (or NS-continuous) at a point p ∈ U, if for every (possibly empty) 
neighborhood, denoted by M, of q = f(p), there is a neighborhood, denoted by N, of 
p, such that N is mapped by f into M; 
 
• Note that the premise “if for every neighborhood, denoted by M, of q = f(p)” rules out the 
possibility that NS(p) is an empty family, and that if the neighborhood system at q = f(p) is 
an empty family then, by vacuous truth,  f  is continuous at the point p ∈ U. 
 
(2) continuous iff  f  is continuous at every point of U; 
 
(3) a topological equivalence iff  f
−1
 exists and both  f and  f
−1
 are continuous. 
 
• Two neighborhood systems NS1(U) and NS2(U) on U are topologically equivalent iff 
the identity mapping of NS1(U) onto NS2(U) is a topological equivalence.  
 
More appropriate terms probably is “pre-continuous”. Observe that in TNS, “pre-continuous” 
is “continuous”. In general, the convention is: when a pre-topological concept becomes a 
topological concept if NS is restricted to TNS, then we will use the topological term. 
 
Deﬁni t ion  5 .  A-/Superset conditions: 
 
8 
second axioms are satisfied 
 
(4) NS(U) determines a Fre´chet (V)space (V-S), or briefly, a (V)space if there are no empty 
neighborhoods for any point. If Sierpinski’s concept of topological equivalence is adopted, then 
(V)space is not a special NS-space. 
 
‧Sierpinski equivalence: Two Fre´chet (V)spaces are said to be topologically equivalent, if their 
derived sets are the same. This equivalence is not a natural one. We believe it was introduced 
from the fact that Sierpinski’s axioms could not differentiate the anti-reflexive from reflexive NS. 
 
 
4.2. NEIGHBORHOOD SYSTEMS AND ROUGH SETS 
 
We will be interested in NS(U) = {NS(p) | p ∈ U }, where NS(p) is a singleton {B(p)}. In 
this case, instead of singleton, we will use the element. So NS will be replaced by 
 
B : U →P(U). 
 
Deﬁni t ion  8.  The Concept of BNS and GRS. 
 
(1) The mapping B or the collection B(U) = {B(p) | p ∈ U} is called a binary neighborhood 
system (BNS). B is equivalent to a binary relation; see below. 
 
(2) If B(U) is a partition, then B is equivalent to an equivalence relation; this is the main focus of 
rough set theory. 
 
(3) A collection C = {Ci ⊆ U | i ∈ I}, where I is an index set, is c a l l e d  a  p a r t i a l / f u l l  
c o v e r i n g  ( P c o v ) .  I t  deﬁnes NS(p) = {C i | p ∈ U }. Observe that NS(p) at 
         is an empty family.  
 
 • (U,B) is called Binary/Third GrC Model, and (U,C) is called Global/Secondary GrC Model in 
the Encyclopedia [4]. 
 
Observe that BNS deﬁnes a binary relation  (BR): 
 
BR = {(p, y) | y ∈ B(p) and p ∈ U }. 
 
Conversely, a binary relation deﬁnes a BNS as follows: 
 
p   B(p) = {y | (p, y) ∈ BR}  
 
 
4.3. FUNDAMENTAL OF NEIGHBORHOOD SYSTEMS 
 
Neighborhood systems have many signiﬁcant points that are very different from topological 
spaces. Let NS(U) be a given neighborhood system. Deﬁnition 3 suggests the following classiﬁcation of 
points in U: 
 
Let C0 be the set of points that is divided into two parts, C0i and C0t, where i 
represents the initial object (this object can be mapped continuously into any other object) 
10 
 
(6) RE-NS(S) is the reflexive empty neighborhood sys-tem (RE-NS) on U if NS(U) consists of an 
empty neighborhood and a nonempty family of reflexive (non-punctured) neighborhoods on S 
and empty families elsewhere. 
 
Remark. These six S are all different S. 
    
A. Decomposition into Simple Neighborhood Systems 
  Now we will decompose an arbitrary neighborhood system NS(U) = {NS(p) | p   U} on U into 
six simple neighborhood systems:    
        
        
        
        
     and    
     are 
defined as follows: 
 
(1)    
      EI-NS(  
 ), where   
                   .That is,    
                 
at     
    , and    
         at        
  . 
 
(2)    
      ET-NS(  
 ), where   
                .That is,    
           
   at     
    , and    
        at        
  . 
 
(3)    
      RE-NS   
  , that is,    
     is defined by two conditions: (1)    
     
                
           for all     
    (empty neighborhood has been 
subtracted away), (2) empty families elsewhere. In other words,    
     consists of (1) the 
empty neighborhood and the reflexive neighborhoods at     
  that are not supersets of 
anti-reflexive neighborhoods and (2) empty families elsewhere. 
 
(4)    
      AE-NS   
  , that is,   
     is defined by two conditions: (1)    
     is a 
subset of NS(p) for all     
    , that consists of the empty neighborhood and all the 
anti-reflexive (punctured) neighborhoods, and (2) empty families elsewhere        
  . 
   • Note that NS(p) may contain some reflexive neighborhoods, so    
     may be a proper 
subset of NS(p) for     
 . 
 
(5)    
      PR-NS   
  , that is,    
     is defined by two conditions: (1)    
     
                
       for all     
    , and (2) empty families elsewhere. In other 
words,    
     consists of (a) the reflexive neighborhoods at     
  that are not supersets 
of anti-reflexive neighborhoods and (b) empty families elsewhere. 
 
(6)    
      PA-NS   
  , that is,    
     is defined by two conditions: (1)    
     is a 
subset of NS(p)     
    , that consists of all the anti-reflexive (punctured) neighborhoods 
only, and (2) empty families elsewhere         
     
 
Theorem 2. 
 
 
Super(NS(p))= 
 
 
         
     , if       
         
     , if        
         
        
     , if      
         
        
     , if      
 
(1) If NS(p) consists of only one single empty neighborhood, then          
    . 
 
(2) If NS(p) is an empty family, then          
    .

(1)     ; 
 
(2)      for any nonempty X   U. 
 
Theorem 4. Let NS(U) be is EI-NS. Then 
 
(1)       ; 
 
(2)       for any nonempty X   U. 
 
Theorem 5. Let NS(U) be one of RE-NS(S), AE-NS(S),PR-NS(S) and PA-NS(S), on U. Then 
 
(1)       ; 
 
(2)    is monotonic on nonempty sets; 
 
(3)     ; 
 
(4) if      then           . 
 
Remark: These four S are all different S. 
 
 
4.5. SIMPLE NEIGHBORHOOD SYSTEMS 
 
Using Definition 11, we immediately obtain the following: 
 
Theorem 6. Let NS(U) be a RE-NS,AE-NS,PR-NS, or PA-NS on U. Then 
 
(1)          . 
 
(2)    is monotonic on nonempty sets. 
 
(3) if      then           . 
 
Remark: It is evident from theorems 4 and 3 that statements (1)-(3) still hold if NS(U) is ET-NS 
and EI-NS respectively. 
 
Theorem 7. Let Dp : P(U) →  P(U)  assign to each     a set Dp(X)   U which is subject 
to the following conditions: 
 
(1) Dp(∅) = DT   (U – Dp(U)). 
 
(2) Dp(X) is monotonic on nonempty sets. 
 
(3) If x   Dp(X) then x   Dp(X-{x}). 
  
It is then possible to define neighborhoods of the elements of U so that U is RE-NS, in which 
 
    Dp          (1) 
14 
condition (2), we obtain    Dp(X).This gives 
 
     Dp          (4) 
 
  Next assume that      and    . 
 
Case 1. If       Dp   , then from conditions (1) and (2),    Dp   . 
 
Case 2. If        ,  then there exists a nonempty reflexive neighborhood  H  of x 
such that  (H − {x}) ∩ X =   and therefore 
 
                                       (5) 
 
Since    , by condition (2), we obtain 
 
 Dp     Dp           . (6) 
 
Since H is a nonempty reflexive neighborhood of x and x   U −DT , it follows from (III) that 
       Dp     ; hence    Dp     . Since      ; therefore, from condition (3), 
  
    Dp           . (7) 
 
By (6) and (7), we obtain    Dp   . This gives  
 
 Dp              . (8) 
 
Combining (2), (4) and (8), we obtain (1). It follow from the above argument that all properties of 
pseudo-derived sets which can be proved to hold in every reflexive neighborhood system can be 
deduced from conditions (1), (2) and (3) of Theorem 7. 
 
Note that Theorem 7 has the following analogue for anti-reflexive empty neighborhood systems. 
 
Theorem 8. Let Dp : P(U)  → P(U)  assign to each     a set Dp(X)    which is subject 
to the following conditions: 
 
(1) Dp(         Dp    . 
 
(2) Dp(X) is monotonic on nonempty sets. 
 
(3) If x   Dp(X) then x   Dp       . 
 
It is then possible to define neighborhoods of the elements of U so that U is a AE-NS in which 
 
    Dp(X),      . 
 
Theorem 9. Let Dp : P(U)  → P(U) assign to each     a set Dp(X)    which is subject 
to the following conditions: 
 
(1) Dp( )       Dp    . 
 
(2) Dp(X) is monotonic on nonempty sets. 
 
16 
    Dp(X),     . 
 
Theorem 12. Let Dp : P(U) → P(U) assigns to each X   U a set Dp     U which is subject to 
the following conditions: 
 
(1) Dp(∅)              . 
 
(2) Dp(X) ∅  for any nonempty    . 
 
It is then possible to define neighborhoods of the elements of U so that U is an empty initial 
neighborhood system EI-NS(    ). Then 
 
    Dp(X),     . 
 
A. Axiomatization 
 
  Here we summarize the theorems into the axiomatization. Let   
  :  P(U) → P(U), 
  
   P(U)→P(U)  ,   
   P(U) → P(U), and   
         → P(U)  assign to     a set 
  
       
       
    , and   
      , respectively, which satisfy the three conditions and 
define the RE-NS    
    , the AE-NS    
    , the PR-NS    
    , and the PA-NS    
    , 
respectively. 
 
Let   
   P(U) → P(U) assign to each X   U a set   
       which is subject to the following 
conditions:  
 
(1)   
 (∅)  U. 
 
(2)   
     ∅ for any nonempty    . 
 
and define the EI-NS   
    . 
 
Let         
           
     ,          
           
      and          
    . 
 
Theorem13. If C1, C2, and C0i are pairwise disjoint, then the five operators   
    
    
    
   and 
  
  define a neighborhood system                   as follows: 
 
 
 
NS(p)= 
 
 
         
     , if       
         
        
     , if      
         
        
     , if      
  , elsewhere 
 
 
 
5. 結果與討論 
In this research, we examine NS as a mathematical system and regarded it as “the” GrM. We 
have completed the axiomatization that Sierpinski accomplished only partially in his book (1952). 
This is significant, as it implies that most likely we have captured a “correct” concept for 
non-numerical uncertainty. Mathematically GrM gives a unified view of fuzzy sets, pre-/topology

(Yang-Lin-Li, 2009) the concept of rough sets (Pawlak, 1982) and variable precision the-
ory (Ziarko, 1993). The consequence is: NS uniﬁes the concept of (ordered by time)
topological spaces, Sierpinski’s Fre´chet (V)space (Sierpinski, 1948) and rough sets that
include classical, variable precision, binary relational and covering theories. Since its
inception, the terminology has been adopt from topological spaces; some are appropri-
ate, some are over done it. In this paper, we shall (re-)deﬁne deﬁnitively the relevant
concepts: major work is focused on RS relevant concepts, closure and interior. There
are major eﬀorts in RS community to axiomatize the closure (upper approximation) by
right neighborhood (left neighborhood if the given neighborhood is left neighborhood);
we disagree with this approach. We take topological approach; we need a new set of in-
variants. For simple case, such invariants are available and axiomatization can be done.
All axiomatizations of RS can be done in this new setting; they will be reported in the
future.
2 Neighborhood Systems and Pre/Pre-/topology
Let U be a non-empty classical set (may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite), which will be the main
universe of discourse throughout this paper. The power set of U , denoted by P(U), is
the family of all subsets of U . That is, P(U) = {S | S ⊆ U}.
It should be remarked that the symbol ⊆ is used in order to allow for the possibility
of set equality. If A ⊆ B and A = B, we say that A is a proper subset of B, or that B
is a proper superset of A. In this case, we write A ⊂ B or B ⊃ A.
Let us recall the concept of topology (Kelley, 1955).
Definition 1 A family T of subsets of U is called a topology on U iﬀ T contains the
whole space U and the empty set ∅, and is closed under ﬁnite intersections and arbitrary
unions.
Here “iﬀ” is Halmos’ convention for “if and only if”. The pair (U, T ) is called a topological
space. The members of T are called open sets of (U, T ). We sometimes refer to U as a
topological space, with T being understood.
A set V in a topological space (U, T ) is called a neighborhood, or T -neighborhood,
of a point p ∈ U iﬀ there exists an open set O ∈ T such that p ∈ O ⊆ V . Topology can
also be deﬁned by using the notion of neighborhood system as a primitive; see (Kelley,
1955).
Definition 2 The Axioms of Topological Neighborhood System (TNS-axioms) is referred
to the following 4 properties of NS(U) = {NS(p) | p ∈ U}, where for every p ∈ U ,
NS(p) = {V (p) ⊆ U}. Observe that V (p) may be empty, ﬁnite or inﬁnite subsets, and
may or may not contain p.
1. p ∈ V (p) for each V (p) ∈ NS(p).

Let U1 and U2 be two universes, and let f : U1 → U2 be a mapping which assigns to each
point u1 ∈ U1 a unique object u2 ∈ U2. For any V ⊆ U1, the set of images of elements of
V is the subset of U2 deﬁned by
f(V ) = {f(u1) | u1 ∈ V }.
In this way, the mapping f : U1 → U2 induces a set mapping from P(U1) to P(U2) which
associates to each V ⊆ U1 its corresponding f(V ) ∈ P(U2). The mapping f : U1 → U2
also induces a set mapping from P(U2) to P(U1) which associates to each W ⊆ U2 the
subset f−1(W ) of U1 deﬁned by
f−1(W ) = {u1 | f(u1) ∈W}.
The two set mappings possess the following properties:
1. f(∅) = ∅;
2. f(U1) ⊆ U2;
3. A ⊆ B ⊆ U1 ⇒ f(A) ⊆ f(B);
4. f−1(∅) = ∅;
5. f−1(U2) = U1;
6. E ⊆ K ⊆ U2 ⇒ f−1(E) ⊆ f−1(K).
Definition 4 Let NS1(U1) = {NS1(u1) | u1 ∈ U1} and NS2(U2) = {NS2(u2) | u2 ∈
U2}, respectively, be two neighborhood systems on U1 and U2, respectively. The mapping
f : U1 → U2 is said to be
1. continuous (or NS-continuous) at u1, if u2 = f(u1) has an empty neighborhood then
the neighborhood system NS1(u1) of u1 must contain an empty neighborhood; and
for every non-empty neighborhood W ∈ NS2(u2), there is a non-empty neighbor-
hood, denoted by V , of u1, such that V is mapped by f into W (i.e., f(V ) ⊆ W );
2. continuous iﬀ f is continuous at every point of U1.
3. a topological equivalence iﬀ f is continuous, , one-to-one and onto such that f−1 is
also continuous.
• More appropriate terms probably is “pre-continuous”. Observe that in TNS, “pre-
continuous” is “continuous”.
• In general, when a pre-topological concept becomes a topological concept if NS is
restrcited to TNS, then we use the topological term. However, we need some caution: In
Lin (1992), “pre-closed set” was termed “closed set”; this is confusing: We shall not use
that, however, we will still use “closure of X”, instead of “pre-closure of X”.

4 Derived Sets and Pseudo-derived Sets
In this subsection, we introduce the concept of derived sets and pseudo-derived sets in a
given neighborhood system space as follows.
Definition 7 Let (U,NS(U)), where NS(U) = {NS(p) | p ∈ U}, be an NS-space and
X a subset of U .
1. A point p ∈ U is called a pseudo-limit point of X = ∅ if NS(p) consists of the
empty neighborhood only.
Such points has no non-empty neighborhood; for those that have non-empty neigh-
borhood, we have the followings:
2. A point p ∈ U is called a pseudo-limit point of non-empty X if p has non-empty
neighborhoods and each of its non-empty neighborhoods contains a point of X other
than p. That is,
• a point p ∈ U is a pseudo-limit point of X = ∅, if ∃ non-empty N ∈ NS(p) and
for every non-empty N ∈ NS(p), N ∩ (X \ {p}) = ∅.
The pseudo-derived set of X, denoted by X∗, is the set of all pseudo-limit points of
X.
3. A point p ∈ U is called a limit point of X if every neighborhood of p contains a
point of X other than p. That is,
• a point p ∈ U is a limit point of X, if every N ∈ NS(p), N ∩ (X \ {p}) = ∅.
The derived set of X, denoted by X ′, is the set of all limit points of X.
Remark This deﬁnition have many hidden points.
1. The pseudo-limit points of the ∅ is deﬁned directly. In other words, they are points
in C0
2. The criterion of limit points imposes constraints on every member of NS(p); so the
constraint implies that NS(p) cannot have empty neighborhood.
3. The criterion of pseudo-limit points imposes constraints only on the sub-family,
namely, the non-empty members of NS(p); some NS(p) may include empty neigh-
borhood. So pseudo-limit point include a limit point as a special case. The pseudo-
limit points are points in C1 ∪ C2, and limit points are points in C2.
6
3. If x ∈ X ′ then x ∈ (X \ {x})′.
4. X ′ ⊆ X∗ for any X ⊆ U .
Let I : P(U) → P(U) be the identity mapping. That is, I(X) = X for any set
X ⊆ U .
Theorem 4 Let Dp : P(U) → P(U) and P : P(U) → P(U) be functions which satisfy
the following conditions:
1. If x ∈ Dp(∅), then x /∈ Dp(X) for any non-empty set X ⊆ U
2. x /∈ Dp({x}) for any x ∈ U .
3. Dp(X) ⊆ Dp(Y ) is monotonic on non-empty sets.
4. If x ∈ Dp(X), then x ∈ Dp(X \ {x}).
5. If (I − P ) ◦Dp(X) = (I − P )(U) ∩Dp(X) for any X ⊆ U .
Then Dp(X) deﬁnes an NS-space U and consists of all pseudo-limit points of X for any
set X ⊆ U in this NS-space; and (I −P ) ◦Dp(X) = (I −P )(Dp(X)) consists of all limit
points of X for any set X ⊆ U .
Proof Suppose that Dp : P(U) → P(U) and P : P(U) → P(U) are functions which
satisfy conditions 1-5. It is then possible to deﬁne neighborhoods of the elements of U
so that U is an NS space in which
X∗ = Dp(X), ∀ X ⊆ U. (1)
and
X ′ = (I − P ) ◦Dp(X), ∀ X ⊆ U. (2)
We are going to deﬁne a neighborhood system at each point x ∈ U as follows:
(i) An empty set is the only neighborhood of a point x ∈ U iﬀ x ∈ Dp(∅).
(ii) An empty set is a neighborhood of a point x ∈ U iﬀ x ∈ P (U).
(iii) A set H ⊆ U is a non-empty neighborhood of the element x ∈ U iﬀ x ∈ U −Dp(U −
H).
It follows from (i) and the deﬁnition of ∅∗ that
∅∗ = Dp(∅). (3)
It follows from (iii) that the whole space U is a neighborhood of every element of U −
Dp(∅); consequently every element of U−Dp(∅) has at least one non-empty neighborhood.
Then, by (i), we see that a point x ∈ U has a non-empty neighborhood iﬀ x ∈ U−Dp(∅).

1. The neighborhoods that are deﬁned by Item (iii) meet the superset conditions
(TNS-axiom 2).
2. Let NS1(p) is generated by the superset condition from NS0(p). It is easy to see
NS1 and NS0 are topologically equivalent.
3. It is clear pseudo-derived set and derived set cannot determine the neighborhood
system completely; we believe the condition ”locally reﬂexive” at each neighborhood
is the needed condition; we will report in future paper.
4. As a corollary, all the closure sets and interior sets cannot always determine the
NS-spaces which include approximation spaces of rough sets
5 Closure and Pseudo-closure
In this subsection, we introduce the concept of closure and pseudo-closure, respectively,
based on limit points and pseudo-pseudo-limit points, respectively.
Definition 9 Let (U,NS(U)) be an NS-space, and let X ⊆ U .
1. The closure of X, denoted by C(X), is the union of X and its derived set. That is,
C(X) = X ∪X ′.
2. The pseudo-closure of X, denoted by Cp(X), is the union of X and its pseudo-
derived set. That is,
Cp(X) = X ∪X∗.
6 Interior and Pseudo-interior of a Set
In this subsection, we introduce the concept of interior points and pseudo-interior points
in a given neighborhood system space.
Definition 10 Let (U,NS(U)) be an NS-space, and let X ⊆ U .
1. A point p ∈ U is called a pseudo-interior point of X if there exists a non-empty
neighborhood of p which is contained in X. That is,
• a point p ∈ U is a pseudo-interior point of X, if ∃ non-empty N ∈ NS(p) such
that N ⊆ X.
The pseudo-interior of X, denoted by Ip(X), is the set of all pseudo-interior points
of X.
