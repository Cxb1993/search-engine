Abstract 
Structure parts under successively cyclic 
loading for a period will present the fact that 
is crack or fatigue. For the reason of safety, 
the requirement of inspection and valuation 
on structure parts are more precisely than 
ever. In order to estimate exactly fatigue 
level of a structure part, this research aims 
at the framework of detective process on the 
experimental fatigue damage growth rate of 
 carbon fiber compound material 
laminates and at development of the 
corresponding damage growth model. In 
order not to further damage the material 
structure while the Non-Destructive 
Evaluation (NDE) was utilized. A C-Scan 
examination were carried on the specimens 
which experience an assigned cycles with 
the load conditions of specific stress ratio, 
specific stress frequency and assigned stress 
level, and obtained their related surface 
scanning images. A program code which 
was able to quantify fatigue damage of a 
specimen was developed. With the help of 
this programmed code, the digital images 
were transferred to an array of numbers to 
match up in images evaluation formula to 
evaluate the damaged level of compound 
material. The obtained result of this research 
shows the tendency of the damage growth 
rate of the compound. The detective process 
on the quantification of the fatigue damage 
growth rate and the expectation of the 
remnant fatigue life of the compound were 
also completed.

1. Introduction  
Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) 
composite materials are extensively used in 
aerospace, marine and many other industries 
due to the advantages they provide in 
performance, structural efficiency and cost. 
While their mechanical behavior is mostly 
well known, their damage and fatigue 
mechanisms still require a better 
understanding.  The most current models 
 2
DIC method is a good non-destructive 
evaluation method utilized to inspect the 
fatigue damage level of a structure. With the 
verification of experiments aided by the 
image processing techniques, this will 
contribute to building a fatigue damage 
model and secure the life prediction and 
designing safety of composite material. 
The employment of digital image 
processing techniques in building an 
estimate model on the overall fatigue 
damage growth of composite materials will 
enable us to have understanding of their 
fatigue damage. Thus, a larger, faster and 
safer application of composite materials can 
be expected. Therefore, the study mainly 
aims to apply the digital image processing 
techniques to building an integrated fatigue 
damage growth model for composite 
materials. Another aim of this study is trying 
to design an empirical prediction system to 
detect the fatigue damage of carbon-fiber 
composite materials by the combination of 
digital image processing techniques with 
C-Scan analysis and detection method. We 
build an effective carbon-fiber composite 
materials fatigue damage prediction model 
by using the estimate system as well as the 
damage level after the different assigned 
fatigue cyclic loading conditions mentioned 
above. A systematic application of digital 
image processing techniques to the damage 
fracture rate estimate of composite materials 
is also discussed. 
One of the aims of this study is to 
develop an inspection method to identify the 
most fatigue damage history occurring in 
these materials in order to estimate their 
remaining lifetime in a non-destructive way. 
 
2. Experimental Details 
The fatigue tests of unidirectional 
specimens made of UD-12K/ Carbon/ 
FAW125 epoxy composites are conducted at 
room temperature under different stress 
levels, stress frequencies, and stress ratios. 
To fabricate the laminate, the bag moulding 
process and a two-stage curing cycle were 
used. The angles of the unidirectional 
composite specimens is . The specimen 
was made by 8 layers of prepregs. The 
geometry of the specimen and its 
dimensions are shown in Fig. 2.1. The end 
tabs are glass/epoxy material with 2.0 mm 
thickness and are bonded to the panels 
before cutting the specimens. The average 
material properties of carbon composite are 
listed in Table 2.1. The Young’s modulus, is 
denoted as 
o0
E . The longitudinal strength, 
volume friction, and ultimate elongation are 
expressed as X , , and fV f1ε  
respectively. The subscript 1 represents the 
fiber direction and 2 the direction transverse 
to the fiber. All the fatigue tests were 
conducted at a Shimadzu servo-hydraulic 
testing machine controlled by a Shimadzu 
winservo system. The tests were under the 
conditions of load control with a sinusoidal 
waveform. The temperature of each 
specimen is measured at its central point to 
monitor the temperature rising of the 
specimens and to prevent the temperature 
effect by properly stopping the fatigue load 
if necessary. The stress ratio here is defined 
as the ratio of the minimum stress to the

4. Results and Discussion 
Figures 4.1(a) – 4.1(f) are the C-San 
images of a composite specimen after 
specific fatigue cycles under the conditions 
of 10Hz stress frequency, 0 stress ratio, and 
0.6 times of the strength of the composites. 
From the images the colors change from 
yellow to green in the images reveals the 
locations and areas of damage level. 
Different colors in the images reveal 
different fatigue damage and the total areas 
of these defects increase with the colors 
change of yellow to green when the loading 
cycles increase. Red area reveals light 
damage and green area means that there are 
more defects inside the zone. The character 
of a color in the C-Scan image reveals a 
correspondent damage level can be utilized 
to be the damage index of the specimen 
under fatigue loading. By estimating the rate 
of each color, the damage level is obtained. 
In order to evaluate the damage level by 
way of the color ratio, a programmed code 
is developed in this study. By Figures 
4.1(a) – 4.1(f) and the code, a series of plots 
of damage index of the specimens’ vs. 
fatigue life were completed. The results are 
shown in Figures 4.4-4.6. from these figures 
and other results of different corresponding 
tests with specific loading conditions, the 
parameters of equation (4) were decided. 
The results are shown in Figures 4.7-4.15. 
By regressive method, the parameters, A, A2 
and a are obtained and shown as equation (5) 
- equation (7).

5. Conclusion 
This study has shown that C-Scan 
inspection and DIC method can be 
combined to detect and to quantify the 
damage of an element under cyclic loading. 
A non-destructive evaluation model utilized 
to inspect the fatigue damage level of a 
specimen is developed. This model 
estimates the fatigue damage level by 
C-Scan and DIC method, and these damage 
data can be utilized to decide the parameters 
of Equation (4), which can be used to 
predict damage level of the specimen with
