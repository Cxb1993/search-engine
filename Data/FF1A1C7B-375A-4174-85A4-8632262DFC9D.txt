deformation will satisfy, in the absence of body force, the following governing
equation:

where Q, R, T are 4x4 matrices whose components are defined by

calculated by

In the present investigations, we are going to discuss the flux singularities at the tip of
a crack with sliding surfaces. For such an investigation, it would be more convenient
to express the general solutions of the generalized displacement u (eq.( 2.5)) and the
stress function (eq(2.7)) in the following form
u=A )( zf q + A )( zf q

4. Generalzed stress singularities at a closed frictionally interfacial
crack
It is noted that the nature of singularities at the frictionally closed crack tips for
general anisotropic piezoelectric bimaterial may be analyzed directly from the
singular equations, however, it would be more straightforward to adopt the common
approach of near- tip expansion method. To do that, we may choose the complex
function )( zf in equation (2.13) to be in the form
)( zf =

*z
therefore the generalized displacement field u and stress function  may be
expressed as
 ~)θ(ζ)θ(ζ 1δ*1δ*1δ qAqAu  r (4.1a)
 ~)θ(ζ)θ(ζ 1δ*1δ*1δ qBqB  r (4.1b)
where
)θsin()θcos()θ(ζ ** p (4.2)
Now, consider the piezoelectric bimaterial that consists of two dissimilar half-planes.
Let material 1 occupies the upper half-plane
 0,0r
while the lower half-plane
0,0  r
is occupied by material 2. Employing Eqs.(4.1a,b) for material 1 and 2, we may have
 ~)θ(ζ)θ(ζ)θ,( (i)1δ*(i)(i)1δ*(i)1δ(i) qAqAu  rr (4.3a)
 ~)θ(ζ)θ(ζ)θ,( (i)1δ*(i)(i)1δ*(i)1δ)i( qBqB  rr (4.3b)
where the superscript (i) (i=1,2) represents quantities related to material 1 or material
2, respectively. It is noted that on the surface 0 and   , variable defined in
(4.1) takes the following special values
1)0(ζ

* 

, δπ

Since the two anisotropic piezoelectric materials are perfectly bonded along the
interface 0 while the surfaces at   are capable of sliding in both x1 and x3
directions and are always closed in x2 direction, hence the continuities of generalized
displacements and tractions at the interface 0 require

Eliminating )2(~q from equations (4.13) and (4.14) leads to an equation for 0q )1(
and from the nontrivial solution of )1(q the characteristic equation for the order of
generalized stress singularities may be obtained as
E 0)1()( 2112   DUUC  ii ee (4.19)

since 0)1( 2 ie . This is the characteristic equation for the frictional cracks for
general anisotropic piezoelectric biomaterial is the same form as that for elasticity
problems. The roots of Eq.(4.24) may be real or complex depending on the values of a,
b and c where the piezoelectric effects are embedded in these constants. The details of
the effects of the piezoelectric materials are carried out by Liou nad Sung(2009) and
results are reported elsewhere(Liou and Sung,2009)).
5. Conclusion
For a frictionally sliding interface crack embedded in an anisotropic piezoelectric
bimaterial with the assumption that uniform frictional resistance over the sliding zone
is assumed and the permeable crack is considered, the nature of flux singularities may
be obtained from the consideration of problem for elastic counterpart. Therefore, the
behavior of the interface crack for the anisotropic piezoelectric materials may be
studied by the same approach adopted for the analysis of elastostatics.
