 This proposal has been successful in developing a number of high-quality and unique results in 
signal processing and communications. From 8/2006 to 7/2007, we have one published journal 
article [5], 3 provisionally accepted papers [2-4], 7 conference papers [6-12], and one submitted 
journal paper [1]. All of them were sent to the best journals and conferences in signal processing 
and communications.  
 
A summary of our technical contributions is as follows: 
 
 Code designs for noncoherent orthogonal space-time coding [5]. In particular, the 
“non-intersecting subspace” orthogonal designs play a very important role, and the concepts 
cannot be found in the present literature to our best knowledge. It also lays groundwork for 
more complex noncoherent space-time coding problems. 
 
 Extension of noncoherent space-time coding to the frequency selective scenario [2,11], using 
combinations of orthogonal codes and OFDM. Using the powerful non-intersecting subspace 
code design results in [5], this work is able to extend our previous successful endeavors to the 
more challenging block faded frequency selective channels. 
 
 Blind multiuser MIMO receivers for block fading channels [3,6-8].  
 
More recently, we have also developed some exciting results regarding MIMO detection with 
high order constellations, new subspace blind MIMO channel identification approach, and further 
extensions to our noncoherent space-time coding and decoding techniques. These new results are 
currently being written, and are expected to submit to top-tier conferences and then journals soon. 
 
Some published articles are attached for reference.

Blind ML Detection of Orthogonal Space-Time Block
Codes: Identifiability and Code Construction
Wing-Kin Ma, Member, IEEE
Abstract—The blind maximum-likelihood (ML) detection of a
general space-time block code (STBC) is considered a challenging
implementation problem. Recent work has revealed that for the
orthogonal STBCs (OSTBCs), their special code structures can be
exploited to formulate highly effective blind ML-based algorithms.
Attracted by this realization merit, this paper investigates the blind
ML identifiability of OSTBCs, with an emphasis on the binary
PSK (BPSK) and quaternary PSK (QPSK) constellations. We find
a class of OSTBCs, called the nonrotatable OSTBCs, that can be
uniquely identified up to a sign (UIUTS) almost surely under a few
mild assumptions. For example, for an independently distributed
Rayleigh channel with any number of receiver antennas, a nonro-
tatable OSTBC can be UIUTS with probability 1. While this identi-
fiability looks appealing already, we further examine a subclass of
nonrotatable OSTBCs, called the nonintersecting subspace (NIS)
OSTBCs. We prove that NIS-OSTBCs are UIUTS for any nonzero
channel. However, NIS-OSTBCs are not available in the existing
literature. To fill this gap, we devise a code construction procedure
that can convert any (BPSK or QPSK) OSTBC to an NIS-OSTBC.

I. INTRODUCTION
I N multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, blinddetection [1], [2] or noncoherent detection [3]–[5] is an
attractive approach when channel state information (CSI) is
not available at the receiver.1 In a number of cases, we can
safely assume CSI being known at the receiver. That is because
CSI can be estimated reliably by transmitting pilot signals,
which has little loss in the data rate if there is an abundant
power resource at the transmitter (e.g., the downlink channel)
and/or if channel fading is slow. However, for channels having
smaller coherence time, accurate pilot-assisted CSI acquisition

1In the signal processing context, “blind detection” is used to to describe de-
tection without CSI. In the information theory context, “noncoherent detection”
is frequently employed. The developments in the two contexts are, in many
ways, different. Very roughly speaking, in signal processing the focus is often
on the blind receiver realization aspects, while in information theory the sub-
jects of interest are the noncoherent channel capacity and code designs.
requires more frequent pilot retransmission. Consequently, the
power and bandwidth overheads for the pilots would no longer
be negligible. In those cases, an alternative worth considering
is the blind or noncoherent detection methods, which either
estimate CSI from received data or bypass CSI in detection.
A popular noncoherent MIMO scheme is differential uni-
tary space-time modulation [6]–[9], which requires the channel
to be static over two space-time code blocks only. The differ-
ential scheme, however, incurs an approximately 3 dB perfor-
mance penalty compared to its coherent counterpart. On the
other hand, in the signal processing context there has been much
interest in developing blind detection methods for space-time
block codes [1], [2], [10]–[17]. In this direction, we consider
“quasi-static” channel fading, where the channel is assumed
to be static over multiple space-time code blocks but where
pilot-assisted CSI acquisition is still inefficient. Blind detection
methods may achieve near coherent detection performance, par-
ticularly when there is a sufficiently large data length (or number
of blocks in which quasi-static fading remains valid).
In this paper, the emphasis is placed on the blind max-
imum-likelihood (ML) detection of orthogonal space-time
block codes (OSTBCs) [18]–[25]. In the coherent space-time
coding scenario, OSTBCs have been well known for their max-
imal spatial diversity and low ML receiver complexity. Recent
research has revealed that OSTBCs are attractive in the non-
coherent scenario, as well. Essentially, given a generic MIMO
or space-time block coding (STBC) scheme, implementing the
blind ML receiver is a highly nonlinear optimization problem.
As a problem common to general multimodal nonlinear opti-
mization, it is hard to guarantee, in every problem instance,
that an optimal or near-optimal blind ML solution be obtained.
The OSTBC scheme is an exception where one can utilize
the special code structures to design more effective blind ML
algorithms, either optimally or suboptimally. In [2] (also [26]),
Stoica et al. proposed a cyclic minimization method for blind
ML OSTBC detection. This cyclic ML receiver exploits the low
coherent receiver complexity, and is simple to implement com-
pared to the same method applied to some other MIMO/STBC
schemes; e.g., spatial multiplexing [10]. As an additional merit,
cyclic ML can be generalized to handle unknown Gaussian
noise covariance [13]. However, cyclic ML requires initializa-
tion of either the channel estimate or the symbol decisions.
By simulation experience, the cyclic ML performance can be
unsatisfactory given a mediocre initialization. In [2], a blind
closed-form method jointly estimating the channel and symbols
was proposed to initialize cyclic ML. That blind closed-form
method is also based on the special characteristics of OSTBCs.
Interestingly, the closed-form method is functionally equivalent

where is the number of transmitter antennas; is the time
length of the code; is the basis matrices of the
code; is the vector containing real information
symbols; and is the th element of . Equation (1) repre-
sents not only OSTBCs with real symbol constellations, but also
those with complex symbol constellations. In the latter case, an
OSTBC can be expressed as [19]
(2)
for some real-valued basis matrices ,
where . In (2), forms a complex
symbol for and the number of complex
symbols per block is . By letting
, the complex code in (2)
can be reformulated as (1). In this paper we assume BPSK and
QPSK constellations, in which case we have . The
basis matrices are specially designed to satisfy [18], [19], [21]
(3)
such that every codeword is row orthogonal; i.e.,
(4)
for any . Here denotes the 2-norm.
In the coherent detection scenario, the code properties in (1),
(3), and (4) result in the well-known advantages of simple ML
detection structures and the maximum spatial diversity [18],
[19]. Orthogonal space-time block coding also provides bene-
fits in the noncoherent scenario, as we will review next.
Remark 1: In principle, any matrix function satisfying (1) and
(3) is said to be an OSTBC. OSTBCs are usually obtained by
applying the theory of generalized orthogonal designs (GODs)
[18]–[25], in which there are additional restrictions on the code
structures. In real GODs, the entries of are constrained to
be drawn from . Hence, the basis matrices
must satisfy the integer structure for all .
As for complex GODs, let
(5)
for notational convenience. The entries of in this
case are drawn from ,
thereby for , and
for . For example,
the complex Alamouti code
(6)
is a GOD. The analysis in this paper is established from (1) and
(3), and GODs will not be assumed unless specified. Hence, our
analysis is applicable to all OSTBCs, including non-GOD codes
(e.g., the “sporadic” codes [18]).
B. Blind ML Detection
We consider a standard scenario [13] where a sequence of OS-
TBCs is transmitted over a frequency-flat, quasi-static channel.
The received signal model is given by
(7)
where is the received code matrix at th code
block; is the MIMO channel matrix; is the
number of receiver antennas; is the frame length or number of
code blocks in which the channel remains static; is
the block of information bits transmitted at the th code block;
is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
matrix. Let
(8)
In the blind or noncoherent scenario, a usual assumption is that
is a deterministic unknown. The respective blind ML detector
is shown to be [10], [13]
(9)
where the unknown and are estimated jointly. Here
stands for the Frobenius norm. If is a generic linear STBC
function, then solving (9) is challenging due to the biconvexity
of the objective function and the constraints on . When
is an OSTBC, one can however exploit the linear disper-
sion and orthogonal structures to simplify the process of solving
Problem (9), either optimally or suboptimally. As discussed in
the introduction, the presently available algorithms for handling
(9) include the closed-form method [2], [16] (also [14]), the
cyclic ML method [2], [13], SDR and sphere decoding [14].
Some performance and complexity comparisons of the various
algorithms have been presented in the prequel of this paper [14].
C. Blind Identifiability Problem Statement
The implementation simplicity of blind ML OSTBC detec-
tion motivates us to investigate the blind identifiability aspects.
For ease of exposition of the identifiability problem, suppose
that the true channel and data matrix is a solution of the
blind ML problem in (9). This solution is unique only when we
cannot find another solution, denoted by , such that the
following channel-code ambiguity equations are satisfied
(10)
An obvious situation leading to (10) is when
. In practice this sign ambiguity problem can be
easily resolved by a number of ways; e.g., using channel coding
[10], or setting one element of to be a pilot. Throughout this
paper we are interested in examining other possible ambigui-
ties, and in finding OSTBCs that can avoid those situations.
Before proceeding to present our main results in the ensuing
sections, we describe a blind OSTBC identifiability condition
obtained by applying a result due to Talwar et al. [10]. The result
3316 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL. 55, NO. 7, JULY 2007
The following theorem shows a sufficient and necessary con-
dition of rotatable OSTBCs.
Theorem 1: The following statements are equivalent:
i) is a rotatable OSTBC.
ii) There exist satisfying
(26)
where , and is an index with
and for .
iii) There exist satisfying
(27)
where is a permutation ma-
trix with , and is diagonal with
.
It is straightforward that Statements ii) and iii) are equivalent,
and that if Statement ii) or iii) is true then Statement i) is true.
But it is not as obvious that Statement i) implies Statements ii)
and iii). The proof of this part is given in the Appendix. Theorem
1 indicates that a rotatable OSTBC always exhibits permutation
ambiguities.
Let us consider some implication of Theorem 1. The equiv-
alent rotatable code condition in (26) implies
for all (due to ). Hence, we have the
following necessary code rotation condition:
Corollary 1: A code rotation matrix , if exists, must be one
of the following candidates
(28)
Corollary 1 is useful in facilitating the numerical inspection
of code rotatability: We only need to check the possibili-
ties of in (28) instead of the considerably larger possibilities
in (18).
The following example illustrates two nonrotatable OSTBCs:
Example 2: Consider the following complex maximal-rate
code with , , and [19]:
(29)
where . Its basis matrices are
(30)
(31)
(32)
If is rotatable, then from (26) the condition
(33)
must be satisfied for some and . By observing the basis
matrices, we see that there does not exist satisfying (33) for
all : The fourth column of is all zero, while the fourth
column of for is not. It is impossible find a such that
the fourth column of is a nonzero vector. Now the problem
remained is the case of . Equation (33) is satisfied for
, but by inspection we found that the resultant
does not satisfy (26) for all . We conclude that the code in (29)
is nonrotatable.
In a similar way, we found that the following 3 4 real full-
rate OSTBC [18]
(34)
is nonrotatable.
Remark 2: It is commonly thought that for an STBC with
complex constellations, blind detection is always subject to a
phase rotation in the detected symbols. Example 2 shows an
interesting example where the complex code in (29) is subject
only to a sign change (assuming the QPSK constellation). This
is attributed to the salient characteristic that the entries of the
code matrix contain the complex symbols and their conjugates,
thereby giving the code some form of immunity to phase rota-
tions.
B. Nonrotatable and Strictly Nonrotatable Codes
While the development above shows that rotatable OSTBCs
are always susceptible to code ambiguities, an interesting ques-
tion is whether the ambiguities can be avoided by using nonro-
tatable OSTBCs. We notice from Definition 1 that for a nonro-
tatable code, there does not exist a unitary such that
(35)
can be satisfied for every . The nonrotatable code
definition, however, does not rule out the possibility that (35)
can be satisfied for some . Suppose that is
nonrotatable but satisfies (35) for two particular distinct bit vec-
tors , . Then, one can verify that the equations
(36)
for may not be satisfied for every ,
but is satisfied when or when
. Nevertheless, one would argue in-
tuitively that when increases, such a situation is unlikely to
happen. This is in fact true, and to illustrate this we consider
the following assumption:
A1) The columns of contains at least
distinct bit vectors.3
To satisfy A1) it is necessary that . For sufficiently
large there is a high probability that A1) holds [10], given
the standard assumption that each element of
is i.i.d. and uniform distributed. The following property shows
that if A1) is true then code rotation ambiguity is impossible.
3As an aside, A1) usually serves as one of the sufficient blind identifiability
conditions for some MIMO/STBC schemes such as spatial multiplexing [10]
and Khatri-Rao space-time coding [11].

C. Identifiability Conditions
Using nonrotatable or strictly nonrotatable OSTBCs is a nec-
essary condition for unique identifiability up to a sign, as shown
in the last subsections. Now, an interesting question is what
are the sufficient identifiability conditions for these two code
classes. Consider a standard MIMO assumption given as fol-
lows:
A2) The channel matrix is complex circular Gaussian dis-
tributed, possibly with nonzero mean and with correlated en-
tries.
Note that A2) encompasses the popular i.i.d. Rayleigh
channel model (or, equivalently, the i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian
channel model). Let denotes the th row of ; i.e.,
(41)
A blind identifiability condition is as follows:
Theorem 3: Suppose that is nonrotatable. Under A2),
is uniquely identifiable up to a sign (UIUTS) with probability 1
if
1) one of the covariance matrices is
positive definite, and
2) A1) holds.
In addition, the same condition holds without requiring A1) if
the code is strictly nonrotatable.
The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix C. A direct
consequence of Theorem 3 is as follows.
Corollary 2: For i.i.d. Rayleigh channels, nonrotatable OS-
TBCs are UIUTS with probability 1 if A1) holds. The same con-
dition holds without requiring A1) if the code is strictly nonro-
tatable.
Theorem 3 gives the important implication that for many
random Gaussian channel fading models, it is almost impos-
sible for strictly nonrotatable OSTBCs to encounter ambiguity
given every and . As for nonrotatable
OSTBCs, the same identifiability condition usually holds for a
sufficiently large data length , where there is a high chance
that A1) holds (cf., the discussion after A1)). We should also
point out that Theorem 3 places no restriction on the number
of receiver antennas . Hence, the probability 1 blind iden-
tifiability result holds even in multiple-input-single-output
(MISO) systems. In fact, the simulation in Example 3 serves as
a testimony to this attractive identifiability result.
As a side product of proving Theorem 3, we found in the
Appendix that
Lemma 3: For any full column rank , nonrotatable OS-
TBCs are always UIUTS if A1) holds. The same condition holds
without requiring A1) if the code is strictly nonrotatable.
Lemma 3 is not as profound as Theorem 3, but it is interesting
because not all MIMO/STBC scheme can be UIUTS given a full
column rank channel; e.g., spatial multiplexing [10]. (It should
be noted, though, that spatial multiplexing can be uniquely iden-
tifiable up to a permutation.)
IV. NONINTERSECTING SUBSPACES, PERFECT IDENTIFIABILITY,
AND CODE CONSTRUCTION
This section considers construction of OSTBCs with good
blind identifiability. This development is motivated by the fact
that many existing OSTBCs are rotatable, as noticed in the pre-
vious section. We examine a subclass of strictly nonrotatable
OSTBCs, viz. the nonintersecting subspace (NIS). This class
of OSTBCs exhibits ’perfect’ blind identifiability, in the sense
that the codes are uniquely identifiable up to a sign for every
nonzero channel and data matrix. The disadvantage of NIS-OS-
TBCs, though, is data rate reduction (under some standard as-
sumption). All these aspects are described in Section IV-A. In
Section IV-B, we propose a simple code construction proce-
dure that can convert the existing OSTBCs to NIS-OSTBCs. In
Section IV-C, we describe a simple way of reducing the rate loss
problem in NIS-OSTBC.
A. Nonintersecting Subspace OSTBCs
The class of NIS-OSTBCs is defined as follows.
Definition 3: An OSTBC is said to be a nonintersecting sub-
space (NIS) OSTBC if
(42)
for every , .
The NIS concepts were introduced in the noncoherent space-
time coding literature [34] for achieving the maximum nonco-
herent spatial diversity [3], [5] in an i.i.d. Rayleigh channel.
However, up to this point there is no study regarding the ex-
istence and construction of NIS-OSTBCs. An NIS-OSTBC is
strictly nonrotatable [compare (42) and Property 2], but the vice
versa is not true. Moreover, NIS-OSTBCs have an additional
constraint on the code length:
Property 4: All NIS-OSTBCs have .
Property 4 can be proven using standard matrix results [33],
[35]. In contrast, strictly nonrotatable codes require
only (Property 3). We found that many existing OSTBCs do not
satisfy Property 4, let alone being NIS.
The following theorem shows that NIS-OSTBCs are “per-
fect” from a blind identifiability standpoint:
Theorem 4: Given every nonzero channel channel
and data matrix , is UIUTS if
and only if is an NIS-OSTBC.
Proof: One can easily show that to be UIUTS for any
and nonzero , it is sufficient and nec-
essary that the following statement holds: For every pair of dis-
tinct bit vectors , , the condition
(43)
cannot be satisfied by any , . By noting that
(44)
and by comparing (44) and (43), we have the conclusion that the
condition in (43) is equivalent to have
for any .
There is a price for employing the NIS-OSTBCs, however.
Lemma 4: Suppose that is based on real or complex
GODs (see Remark 1, Section II-A for the descriptions re-
garding GODs). If is also an NIS-OSTBC, then it does not

(a) the SDR-ML method; and (b) the cyclic ML.
C. A Modified OSTBC Scheme
The NIS-OSTBCs generated by Construction I have a data
rate of bits per channel use (bpcu). This rate is
relatively lower than that of their original counterpart; that is,
bpcu. To reduce the rate loss, we propose the following
modified transmission scheme.
Modified OSTBC Transmission Scheme
Given an OSTBC where
is even, and a frame length .
Step 1. Set .
Step 2. For , transmit where .
Step 3. For , transmit where .
The difference between the original and modified transmis-
sion schemes lies in the first transmitted code block only, where

SDR-ML detector was used. (a) QPSK Alamouti. (b) BPSK 3 4 OSTBC.
the modified scheme transmits a 1-bit-reduced OSTBC
in place of in the original case. Since the first two code
blocks and can be seen as one NIS-OSTBC,
perfect identification of (up to a sign) is guaranteed and it
follows that the rest of the code blocks
are also perfectly identifiable. Alternatively, the code frame
can regarded as a supercode
that has the NIS property inherited from .
The rate of the modified scheme is bpcu.
Hence, for large , the rate of the modified scheme approaches
that of the original.
The performance of the modified OSTBC scheme is illus-
trated by simulations as follows:
Example 5: This example compares the performance of
the original and modified OSTBC transmission schemes. The
simulation settings here are identical to that in Example 4,
and the SDR-ML detector was employed. Fig. 3(a) plots the
performance in the QPSK Alamouti case. We see that the mod-
ified scheme has its bit error probability being consistent and
decaying at the same rate as that of the coherent ML (thereby

distance equals zero only when . Now, it

In the paper, our interest lies in jointly estimating H and detecting
s from Y . As mentioned and clariﬁed in Sec. 1, the signiﬁcance of
this investigation is in the block fading scenario where H may not
be the same for each OSTBC-OFDM block.
3. SEMIBLIND ML DETECTION
We consider the deterministic semiblind ML criterion [10,11] where
part of s is known at the receiver. For simplicity, assume that the ﬁrst
M subchannels contain pilots (generalization to other pilot place-
ments is straightforward). Let
s = [sTp , s
T
d ]
T ∈ {±1}NcK , (10)
where sp = [sT1 , ..., sTM ]
T stands for the pilot data and sd =
[sTM+1, ..., s
T
Nc ]
T denotes the unknown data. Then the semiblind
ML detector is given by
{sˆd, Hˆ} = arg min
sd ∈ {±1}(Nc−M)K
H ∈ CLNt×Nr
||Y − C(s)H||2F , (11)
where || · ||F denotes the Frobenius norm. We present a data iden-
tiﬁability analysis for (11), followed by the implementation method
of the semiblind ML detector. It will be shown in Sec. 3.1 that the
data identiﬁability can be guaranteed in a probability one sense when
there is one pilot code transmitted, i.e., M = 1. Regarding the re-
alization issue, in the next subsection, it is shown that (11) can be
reformulated as a Boolean quadratic program (BQP) where efﬁcient
implementation is possible [12].
3.1. Data Identiﬁability
To investigate the data identiﬁability, the signal model in (8) in the
absence of noise is considered
Y = C(s)H. (12)
It is clear that, in the absence of noise, {sd,H} is a solution pair
of (11). Suppose that there exist s′d ∈ {±1}(Nc−M)K and H′ ∈
C
LNt×Nr so that {s′d,H′} is also a solution pair of (11). Then
C(s′)H′ = C(s)H, (13)
where
s′ = [sTp , s
′T
d ]
T ∈ {±1}NcK . (14)
To ensure the data identiﬁability, we analyze (13) and look for con-
ditions under which (13) holds only if {s′d,H′} = {sd,H}.
We start our analysis by considering that there are at leastL pilot
codes (i.e., M ≥ L). Let
Cp(sp) =



C(s1)

INt ⊗ fT1

...
C(sM )

INt ⊗ fTM


	


∈ CMT×LNt . (15)
From (13) and (15), one can obtain
Cp(sp)H′ = Cp(sp)H. (16)
It is not hard to show that Cp(sp) is of full column rank for M ≥ L.
Hence, (16) results in H′ = H, i.e., the channel can be uniquely
identiﬁed. However, channel identiﬁcation does not imply data iden-
tiﬁcation because, if Hn = 0 for some n, then the data sn can never
be recovered even when full CSI is available. However, the probabil-
ity that this channel nullity occurs is quite low for an MIMO fading
channel. Let us consider the following channel assumption:
A1) The channel H is Gaussian distributed and at least one column
of H has a positive deﬁnite covariance matrix.
One can see that independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh
fading channels satisfy A1). Under A1), one can show that the
probability of the event {Hn = 0} is of measure zero. Thus we
conclude that the data can be identiﬁed with probability one if there
are at least L pilot codes. In practice, given M ≥ L, the channel can
be estimated by a least-squares (LS) channel estimator [10, 15]
Hˆ =
 
CHp (sp)Cp(sp)
−1 CHp (sp)YM , (17)
where YM = [YT1 , ...,YTM ]T .
In the paper, instead of usingL pilot codes, we show that a single
pilot code is sufﬁcient to ensure probability one data identiﬁability.
Let us look at the following lemma:
Lemma 1: Assume that A1) holds and that there is no noise. Sup-
pose that C(s) satisﬁes the following condition:
C1) Let s′ = [sTp , s′Td ]T ∈ {±1}NcK . There does not exist a
matrix U ∈ CLNt×LNt such that
C(s′)U = C(s), (18)
for any s′d = sd.
Then the data sd can be uniquely identiﬁed with probability one.
The proof of Lemma 1 is given in the Appendix. One can see that
the aforementioned LS method (which uses at least L pilot codes) is
an approach to make C1) hold and thereby can have the probability
one data identiﬁability. However, by exploiting the special structure

 CH(s′)C(s′)−1 CH(s′) on both sides of (13) re-
sults in
H′ = UH. (28)
Substituting (28) into (13) yields
 C(s)− C(s′)UH = 0. (29)
Let Φ = C(s) − C(s′)U. Under C1), we have Φ = 0. The proba-
bility that (29) holds is given by
Pr {ΦH = 0} = Pr

j=1
ΦHej = 0

≤ Pr {ΦHei = 0} , (30)
for some i, where ei ∈ RNr denotes a unit vector with the ith en-
try equal to unity. According to A1), let the ith column of H be
Gaussian distributed with a positive deﬁnite covariance matrix. Then
one can show that Pr {ΦHei = 0} is of measure zero. Hence, (13)
holds with probability zero. Therefore, the data sd can be uniquely
identiﬁed with probability one. 

3. NEW BSS CRITERION BY CONVEX ANALYSIS
In this section, we ¿rst review some convex analysis concepts essen-
tial to this work, and then present our main results.
3.1. Some Basic Concepts of Convex Analysis
We review two convex analysis concepts [9], [10] that will play an
important role to the ensuing development. The ¿rst is the af¿ne hull
of a set of vectors {s1, . . . , sN} ⊂ RL, de¿ned as
aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} =   x =
N

i=1
θisi 



θ ∈ RN ,
N

i=1
θi = 1  .
(4)
For N = 2, the af¿ne hull is a line passing through s1 and s2; see
Fig. 1(a). The af¿ne hull can always be represented by an af¿ne set:
aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} =  x = Cα + d


α ∈ RP  (5)
for some (non-unique) d ∈ RL andC ∈ RL×P . Here,C is assumed
to be of full column rank and P represents the dimension of the
af¿ne set which must be less than N . For example, if {s1, . . . , sN}
is a linearly independent set, then P = N − 1. In that case, a
legitimate (C,d) can simply be obtained by C = [ s1 − sN , s2 −
sN , . . . , sN−1 − sN ] and d = sN . In the ensuing subsections we
will be faced with the problem of ¿nding (C,d) from {s1, . . . , sN}
for P < N − 1.
The second key concept is that of the convex hull of a set of
vectors {s1, . . . , sN} ⊂ RL, de¿ned as
conv{s1, . . . , sN} =   x =
N

θi = 1  .
(6)
ForN = 2, the convex hull is a line segment between s1 and s2; see
Fig. 1(a). Geometrically s1, . . . , sN would be the ‘corner points’
of its convex hull, de¿ned formally as the extreme points. A point
x ∈ conv{s1, . . . , sN} is an extreme point of conv{s1, . . . , sN}
if it cannot be a nontrivial convex combination of s1, . . . , sN ; i.e.,
x =

i=1
θisi (7)
for all θ ∈ RN+ ,  Ni=1 θi = 1, and θ = ei for any i (where ei
is the unit vector with the ith entry being equal to 1). The set of
extreme points of conv{s1, . . . , sN} must be either the full set or
a subset of {s1, . . . , sN}. In addition, if {s1, . . . , sN} is a linearly
independent set, then the set of extreme points of conv{s1, . . . , sN}
is exactly {s1, . . . , sN}.

3.2. Signal Af¿ne Hull Characterization
With the aforedescribed convex analysis concepts, we see from the
signal formulation in (3) and (A3) that
xi ∈ aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} (8)
for all i = 1, . . . ,M . This leads to an interesting question whether
the observations x1, . . . ,xM provide suf¿cient information to deter-
mine the source signal af¿ne hull aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN}. This is indeed
possible, as described in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. Suppose that (A3) and (A4) hold. Then,
aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} = aﬀ{x1, . . . ,xM}. (9)
The proof of Lemma 1 is omitted due to the page limit. Fig. 1(b)
demonstrates geometrically the validity of Lemma 1. We will show
later that given knowledge of aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN}, it is possible to per-
fectly recover all s1, . . . , sN . Now let us focus on characteriza-
tion of aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN}. It can easily be shown from (A2) that
{s1, . . . , sN} is linearly independent. Hence, aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} has
dimension N − 1 and admits a representation
aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} =  x = Cα + d


α ∈ RN−1   A(C,d)
(10)
for some (C,d) ∈ RL×(N−1) × RL such that rank(C) = N − 1.
Note that (C,d) is non-unique. Without loss of generality, we can
restrictC to a semi-unitary matrix, i.e.,CTC = I.
It is easy to obtain (C,d) from the observations x1, . . . ,xM if
M = N ; see the example mentioned in Section 3.1. The nontrivial
case lies inM > N , for which a method, referred to as the af¿ne set
¿tting, is proposed next.
Consider the following projection problem
min
C˜,d˜
C˜
T
C˜=I
M

i=1
‖xi −PA(C˜,d˜)(xi)‖

where ‖.‖2 denotes the 2-norm; andPA(x) stands for the projection
of x onto the setA, de¿ned as
PA(x) = arg min
x˜∈A
‖x − x˜‖22. (12)
The idea behind is to ¿nd an (N − 1)-dimensional af¿ne set that has
the minimum projection error with respect to the observations. At
¿rst glance, (11) is a nonconvex optimization problem, but in fact it
can be solved analytically as stated in the following proposition:
Proposition 1. The af¿ne set ¿tting problem in (11) has a closed

The proof of Proposition 1 is given in Section 7. We should add
that the af¿ne set ¿tting solution in Proposition 1 works for M =
N as well. Moreover, in the presence of noise the af¿ne set ¿tting
would serve as a favorable way for noise reduction, since it provides
a best af¿ne set that achieves the minimum data ¿tting error.

Note that 0 ≤ ρ˜ ≤ 1 and the larger ρ˜, the better the performance
of the algorithm under test. Three correlated human face image
sources (N = 3) taken from the benchmarks in [2] were used
to generate three noise-free observations and ¿fteen noisy observa-
tions. Note that we add zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance
σ2i to produce noisy observations with the same signal-to-noise ra-
tio (SNR=SNRi=25dB) where SNRi = ‖ xi ‖22/Lσ2i . To maintain
non-negativity of the observations in the simulation, we force the
negative noisy observations to zero. The averaged values of ρ˜ over
the performed ¿fty independent runs are displayed in Table 1. From
this table, one can see that proposed method performs better than the
other three existing algorithms (i.e., maximum averaged ρ˜).

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTUREWORKS
We have developed a new blind separation criterion for non-negative
sources by a convex analysis approach. This approach is determinis-
tic and geometry-based, requiring no source independence assump-
tion. Based on the new criterion (Theorem 1), a BSS method (for
N = 2 and N = 3) has been proposed. Some experimental results
reveal that the proposed BSS method outperforms nLCA, nICA, and
NMF. As future directions, we shall consider extension to the case
ofN > 3 and investigate relaxations of the assumptions made in the
paper.

From (A2), it follows that z[i] = θisi[i] ≥ 0, ∀i. Since si[i] >
0, we must have θi ≥ 0, ∀i. Therefore, z lies in conv{s1, ..., sN}.
On the other hand, assume that z ∈ conv{s1, ..., sN}, i.e.,
z =
N
 

T
θ = 1, θ

implying that z ∈ aﬀ{s1, ..., sN}. From (A1), we have si 
 0 ∀i
and subsequently z 
 0. This completes the proof for (16). More-
over, the fact that s1, ..., sN are linearly independent (according to
(A2)) implies that {s1, ..., sN} is the set of all the extreme points of
conv{s1, ..., sN} (cf., Sec. 3.1).
Proof of Lemma 3. Equation (18) can also be expressed as
F =   α ∈ RN−1 |Cα + d ∈ conv{s1, ..., sN}  .
Thus, every α ∈ F satis¿es
Cα + d =

for some θ 
 0, θT1 = 1. Now, due to the one-to-one mapping
si = Cαi + d ∈ S (between S and F), one can infer that (25) is
equivalent to
α =
N

i=1
θiαi, θ
T
1 = 1, θ 
 0 (26)
meaning that F = conv{α1, ..., αN}. Now, suppose that α1 is not
an extreme point, i.e., α1 =  Ni=1 θiαi, θ = e1. Then one can
easily show that s1 = Cα1 + d =  Ni=1 θisi, θ = e1, i.e., s1
is not an extreme point (contradiction). So, all αi must be extreme
points of F .

In principle, any matrix function satisfying (1) and (2) is said
to be an OSTBC. In practice, most existing OSTBCs are based
on generalized orthogonal designs (GODs) [7–9], which have ad-
ditional restrictions on the code structures. In real GODs, for
instance, the entries of C(s) are constrained to be drawn from
{0,±s1, . . . ,±sK} thereby Xk ∈ {0,±1}Mt×T for all k. For
example, the BPSK Alamouti code
C(s) =
[
s1 −s2
s2 s1
]
(4)
is a GOD. The analysis here is established from (1) and (2), and
GODs will not be assumed unless speci¿ed. Hence our analysis is
also applicable to non-GOD codes (e.g., the ‘sporadic’ codes [7]).
2.2. Blind ML Detection and Blind Identi¿ability
We consider a standard scenario [2] where a sequence of OSTBCs
is transmitted over a frequency-Àat, quasi-static channel. The re-
spective received signal model is given by
Yp = HC(sp) + Vp, p = 1, . . . , P, (5)
whereYp ∈ CMr×T is the received code matrix at pth code block,
sp ∈ {±1}
K is the transmitted bit vector at the pth code block,
H ∈ CMr×Mt is the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
channel, Mr is the number of receiver antennas, P is the frame
length or number of code blocks in which the channel remains
static, and Vp ∈ CMr×T is an additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) matrix. Let
S = [ s1, . . . , sP ] ∈ {±1}
K×P , (6)
and assume that H is a deterministic unknown. The blind ML
detector is given by [2, 4]
{Hˆ, Sˆ} = arg min
H˜∈CMr×Mt ,
S˜∈{±1}K×P
P∑
p=1
‖Yp − H˜C(s˜p)‖
2
F (7)
where the unknown H and S are estimated jointly. Here ‖.‖F
stands for the Frobenius norm.
If C(.) is simply a linear dispersion code satisfying (1), then
solving (7) would be dif¿cult. It has been shown [2] that by ex-
ploiting the code orthogonality in (3), Problem (7) can simpli¿ed
to a Boolean quadratic program
Sˆ = arg max

(8)
where Gpq ∈ RK×K with [Gpq ]k = Re{tr{YpXHk XYHq }}
(While (8) leads to Sˆ only, Hˆ can be computed directly from Sˆ if
necessary; see [2, 4]). Problem (8) can then be handled subopti-
mally by either the closed-form method [1,3] or the quasi-optimal
SDR method [2]. Alternatively, (8) can be solved optimally by a
sphere decoding algorithm [2]. Some performance and complexity
aspects of the various algorithms have been reported in [2].
The implementation simplicity of blind ML OSTBC detection
motivates us to investigate the blind identi¿ability aspects, stated
as follows: Suppose that the true channel H and data matrix S is
a solution of the blind ML problem in (7). This desired solution
is unique only when we cannot ¿nd another solution, denoted by
{H˜, S˜}, such that
HC(sp) = H˜C(s˜p), p = 1, . . . , P. (9)
An obvious situation leading to (9) is when {H˜, S˜} =
{−H,−S}. Sign ambiguity is an inherent problem, but can be
¿xed easily by a number of ways; e.g., setting one element of S to
be a pilot. Given {H,S}, we say that S is uniquely identi¿able up
to a sign if (9) does not hold for any {H˜, S˜} = ±{H,S}. In the
next section, we will consider the class of the NIS-OSTBCs and
its blind identi¿ability.
3. NONINTERSECTING SUBSPACE OSTBCS
This section contains the main results of this paper. In the ¿rst
subsection we de¿ne the NIS-OSTBCs and study their properties.
The second subsection proposes an NIS-OSTBC construction pro-
cedure. The proof leading to our construction procedure is detailed
in the third subsection.
3.1. Nonintersecting Subspace Codes and Their Properties
LetR(A) denote the range space ofA. The following is our def-
inition for a nonintersecting subspace (NIS) OSTBC:
De¿nition 1 An OSTBC is said to be a NIS-OSTBC if
R(CT (s)) ∩ R(CT (s˜)) = {0} (10)
for every s, s˜ ∈ {±1}K , s = ±s˜.
The NIS concepts were introduced in the noncoherent space-time
coding literature [5] for achieving the full noncoherent spatial di-
versity in an i.i.d. Rayleigh channel. Up to this point there is no
study regarding the existence and construction of NIS-OSTBCs,
which is the subject of this paper. From a blind identi¿ability
standpoint, NIS-OSTBCs are ‘perfect’ blind space-time codes:
Theorem 1 Given every nonzero channel H ∈ CMr×Mt and
data matrix S ∈ {±1}K×P , S is uniquely identi¿able up to a
sign if and only ifC(.) is an NIS-OSTBC.
Proof: One can verify easily that to avoid the channel-code am-
biguity in (9) for any S ∈ {±1}K×P , H ∈ CMr×Mt \ {0}, it
is suf¿cient and necessary that the following statement holds: For
every pair of bit vectors (s, s˜) with s = ±s˜, the condition
hTC(s) = h˜TC(s˜) (11)
holds for any h, h˜ ∈ CMt \ {0}. By noting that
R(CT (s)) ∩R(CT (s˜)) ={
y
∣∣∣ y = CT (s)h = CT (s˜)h˜, for some h, h˜ ∈ CMt} (12)
and by comparing (12) and (11), we conclude that (11) is equiva-
lent to haveR(CT (s)) ∩ R(CT (s˜)) = {0} for any s = ±s˜. 
There is a price for using NIS-OSTBCs, however.
Lemma 1 Suppose that C(.) is a real or complex GOD. If C(.)
is also an NIS-OSTBC, then it does not achieve the full rate; i.e.,
K < T for real GODs and K/2 < T for complex GODs.

where

If Q1 − Q2 is singular, then at least one of its eigenvalues has
to be 0. From (26), the eigenvalues of Q1 − Q2 are given by
λi(Q1−Q2) = γ+λi(B1−B2), i = 1, . . . ,Mt. SinceB1−B2
is skew-Hermitian, its eigenvalues λi(B1 − B2) are either pure
imaginary or zero [11]. Hence, to have a singular Q1 − Q2 it is
necessary that γ = 0. Since K is even, we can write K = 2m
for some integerm. Likewise, α2 can be represented by α2 = 2c
where c ∈ {0,±1, . . . ,±m}. The condition γ = 0 implies that
α1 =
K − 1
K
α2 =
(2m− 1)c

From (24) α1 is an odd number, but Eq. (28) indicates that α1 is
not an integer unless c = 0 or c = ±m. For c = 0 we have
α1 = 0, a contradiction. For c = ±m, we have α1 = ±(K −
1) and α2 = ±K. Such a condition can only be satis¿ed when
[ μT νT ]T = ±[ μ˜T ν˜T ]T , a contradiction to s = ±s˜.
4. SIMULATION RESULTS
This simulation example compares the performance of the origi-
nal and modi¿ed OSTBC transmission schemes. The numbers of
transmitter and receiver antennas are Mt = 3 and Mr = 1, re-
spectively. The code matrix is the one in (13). In the simulation,
the channel is i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian distributed. The blind re-
ceiver employed here is the SDR-ML [2] (note that the other blind
ML implementations could also be used, but with the page limit
only SDR-ML is considered). The sign ambiguity effect is elim-
inated by assuming that one of the bit symbols is known at the
receiver.
The results were plotted in Fig. 1. In the ¿gure, we also show
the performance of differential OSTBC [12, 13], another effec-
tive noncoherent space-time technique. We see that the modi¿ed
scheme has a substantially better bit error performance than the
original scheme. It also yields better performance than the differ-
ential scheme for P ≥ 8, by about 1.5dB when P = 16.
Fig. 1 also reveals that the modi¿ed scheme achieves the full
noncoherent spatial diversity, as promised by its NIS characteris-
tic. In essence, the bit error probability of the modi¿ed scheme
is observed to be decaying at the same rate as that of the coherent
ML. However, such a decaying rate is lower in the original scheme.
5. CONCLUSION
The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we have exam-
ined the impacts of NIS-OSTBCs on blind ML space-time coding.
In particular, our analysis has shown that NIS-OSTBCs are an at-
tractive class of blind space-time codes, in the sense that they are
uniquely identi¿able up to a sign for any nonzero channel. Sec-
ond, we have derived an NIS-OSTBC construction procedure. The
procedure works by applying a simple modi¿cation to an existing
OSTBC, and is very easy to use.

i = 1, 2, · · · ,M , be the position of the ith sensor.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the positions
of the ﬁrst k of them, s1, s2, · · · , sk, where k ≥ 3, are
known. The task is to ﬁnd si, i = k+1, k+2, · · · ,M .
To derive our proposed positioning approach, we ﬁrst

of xi − xj and yi − yj , i > j, with at least one of
the si and sj being unknown. Mathematically, X is
represented as

The subspace method to be presented is based on
examining the subspace and rank properties of the so-
called multidimensional similarity matrix [13]
D = XXT (4)
The rank of D is rankD = rankX = 2. The matrix D

decomposed using eigenvalue factorization as

R(MC2−kC2)×2 and Un ∈ R(MC2−kC2)×(MC2−kC2−2) are
called the signal and noise eigenvectors, respectively.
As X lies in the signal subspace Us, we have

When disturbance is present, noise-free distances {di,j}
are available only for k ≥ i > j ≥ 1. In our study,
we generalize all the observed distance measurements,
denoted by ri,j , as
ri,j = rj,i = di,j + qi,j
where qi,j = qj,i is the possible zero-mean noise with
variance σ2i,j ≥ 0 if max(i, j) = k + 1, k + 2, · · · ,M ,
and σ2i,j = 0 otherwise with max(i, j) = i if i ≥ j.
This means that for practical purposes, {ri,j} will
be substituted for {di,j} in (5) when the latter is
unavailable in forming D. As a result, the equal signs
in (7) and (8) should be replaced by the approximate

Lp : total number of paths (or DOAs) of user p.
The channel is considered invariant within one OFDM block,
i.e., each path gain
αp,l = |αp,l|ejψp,l (2)
is constant within one block, and so are θp,l and τp,l. Assume
that the receiver at the base station is equipped with a uniform
linear antenna array of Q elements equally spaced by half a
carrier wavelength. The received signal can be expressed as
x[n] =
P∑
p=1
Lp∑
l=1
αp,la(θp,l)sp[n− τp,l] +w[n], (3)
n = −Ng, ..., N − 1, where w[n] is a Q× 1 noise vector and
a(θp,l) = [1, ejpi sin(θp,l), ..., ejpi(Q−1) sin(θp,l)]T (4)
is the steering vector of the lth path of user p.
Next, let us make some assumptions about the MIMO
channel model given by (3) as follows:
(A1) u1[k], u2[k], . . . , uP [k] are independent identically dis-
tributed (i.i.d.) quadriphase-shift keying (QPSK) sym-
bol sequences (i.e., up[k] ∈ {1,−1, j,−j}), and uq[k]
is statistically independent of up[k] for all q 6= p.
(A2) θq,m 6= θp,l for all (q,m) 6= (p, l); L = L1 + ...+ LP
(total number of paths of all the users) and Q > L.
(A3) τp,l ∈ {0, 1, ..., Ng} for all l and p (quasi-synchronous
OFDM system) and τp,1 < τp,2 < ... < τp,Lp .
(A4) w[n] is zero-mean Gaussian with E{w[n]wH[n]} =
σ2wIQ, and is statistically independent of up[k], p = 1,
2, ..., P , where IQ is a Q×Q identity matrix.
After the processes of the removal of GI, S/P conversion,
N -point FFT operation, and P/S conversion at each receive
antenna, the received signal at each subcarrier k can be ex-
pressed as:
x[k] =
P∑
p=1
Lp∑
l=1
αp,la(θp,l)up[k]e−j2pikτp,l/N +w[k]
= A(k)u(k) +w[k], k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, (5)
where w[k] is also a Q× 1 white Gaussian noise vector,
u(k) = (u1[k], u2[k], ..., uP [k])T ∈ CP×1, (6)
A(k) = (a(k)1 ,a
(k)
2 , ...,a
(k)
P ) ∈ CQ×P , (7)
and each column of A(k) is given by
a(k)p =
Lp∑
l=1
αp,la(θp,l)e−j2pikτp,l/N . (8)
Like the semi blind channel estimation method in the subcar-
rier domain [7], our objective is also to estimate the matrix
A(k) for all the N subcarriers, but blindly. It should be noted
that in the post-FFT MIMO model given by (5), the mix-
ing matrix A(k) is a function of subcarrier index k, implying
that a distinct blind channel estimator for each subcarrier is
needed, thus leading to a large computational load. Alterna-
tively, the MIMO signal model in (5) can also be re-expressed
as follows:
x[k] = Au[k] +w[k], k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, (9)
where A and u[k] are defined as follows:
A = (A1, ...,AP ) ∈ CQ×L, (10)
Ap = (αp,1a(θp,1), ..., αp,Lpa(θp,Lp)) ∈ CQ×Lp , (11)
u[k] = (uT1 [k],u
T
2 [k], ...,u
T
P [k])
T ∈ CL, (12)
up[k] = (up,1[k], up,2[k], ..., up,Lp [k])
T ∈ CLp , (13)
up,l[k] = up[k]e−j2pikτp,l/N . (14)
Based on the MIMO signal model (9), the proposed blind
channel estimator (not dependent on k) is to estimate the mix-
ing matrixA and all the time delays τp,l from which the chan-
nel estimate of A(k) can be obtained straightforwardly by (7)
and (8).
3. PROPOSED BLIND CHANNEL ESTIMATION
ALGORITHM
The proposed blind channel estimation algorithm is based on
the subcarrier averaging [8] over one OFDM block. Specifi-
cally, let
〈up,l[k]〉 , 1
N
N−1∑
k=0
up,l[k] (15)
denote the subcarrier average of up,l[k]. It can be observed,
from the source vector u[k] of (12), that up,l[k], l = 1, 2, ...,
Lp are correlated with each other since
E{up,i[k]u∗p,j [k]} = e−j2pik(τp,i−τp,j)/N 6= 0
for all i 6= j (by (14)).
Let
Ru , 〈u[k]uH[k]〉 (16)
denote the subcarrier average based correlation matrix ofu[k].
All the components of u[k] become uncorrelated by subcar-
rier averaging as stated in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. Under the assumptions (A1) and (A3), Ru
p−→
IL, where
p−→ denotes “convergence in probability” as N →
∞.
The proof of Lemma 1 is omitted due to page limit. Sim-
ilarly, the subcarrier average based correlation matrix of the
received signal x[k] can be easily seen to be
Rx = A〈u[k]uH[k]〉AH + 〈w[k]wH[k]〉
p−→ AAH + σ2wIQ. (by (9) and Lemma 1) (17)
is the normalized correlation coefficient between y(r)c [k] and
gp[k]. Note that ρ itself is complex and |ρ| ≤ 1.
At the end of stage p, by (27) and (29) the obtained Gp
turns out to be a set of all the path signals associated with
“user p”, i.e.,
Gp = {yp,l[k] | yp,l[k] = αp,lup[k], l = 1, 2, ..., Lp } , (31)
where p = 1, 2, ..., P and each p uniquely maps to a true user
number p′ and vice versa (i.e., user permutation ambiguity).
3.5. Path Gain Estimation
In this subsection, we present how to estimate the complex
path gain αp,l for each path signal of Gp. The path gain esti-
mation can be separated into two parts: magnitude estimation
and phase estimation of path gain.
3.5.1. Magnitude Estimation of Path Gain
Because up[k] is QPSK by (A1), it can be easily shown that〈
(yp,l[k])
4
〉
= (αp,l)
4 = |αp,l|4ej4ψp,l , (32)
where ψp,l is the phase of αp,l (see (2)). Therefore,〈
(yp,l[k])
4
〉1/4
=
∣∣∣〈(yp,l[k])4〉∣∣∣1/4 ejψ(i)p,l , (33)
where
ψ
(i)
p,l = ψp,l + (pi/2)i, i = 1, ..., 4. (34)
By (32) and (33), the path gain magnitude estimate can be
obtained as
|α̂p,l| =
∣∣∣∣〈(yp,l[k])4〉1/4∣∣∣∣ . (35)
3.5.2. Phase Estimation of Path Gain
As any other blind channel estimation algorithms, the pro-
posed blind channel estimation algorithm can only provide
the path phase estimates
ψ̂p,l = ψp,l + ϕp, l = 1, 2, ..., Lp, (36)
(i.e., the same phase ambiguity for all the Lp paths) simply
because each column a(k)p of A(k) associated with a up[k]
(see (8)) can only be estimated up to a phase ambiguity (i.e.,
â(k)p = a
(k)
p ejϕp). Therefore, by (36) and (31), it can be
easily seen that for all yp,l[k] ∈ Gp,
y′p,l[k] , yp,l[k]e−j
bψp,l = |αp,l|e−jϕpup[k], (37)
for which the equivalent path gains |αp,l|e−jϕp for all l have
the same phase −ϕp, implying that
ρ(y′p,l[k], y
′
p,m[k]) = 1 ∀ l andm. (38)
Based on (38) and (34), the following procedure is pro-
posed to determine ψ̂p,l from {ψ(i)p,l , i = 1, ..., 4}, l = 1, 2,
..., Lp.
Step P-1: Determine ψ̂p,1 by choosing an arbitrary member
of {ψ(i)p,1, i = 1, ..., 4}. Then obtain
y′p,1[k] = yp,1[k]e
−j bψp,l = |αp,1|up[k]e−jϕp , (39)
where ϕp ∈ {0,±pi/2, pi}.
Step P-2: For l = 2, ...,Lp, obtain y
(i)
p,l [k] = yp,l[k]e
−jψ(i)p,l
based on (37), and then compute
ρ(i) = ρ(y(i)p,l [k], y
′
p,1[k]), i = 1, ..., 4. (40)
Obtain ψ̂p,l = ψ
(m)
p,l where m = argmin1≤i≤4
∣∣ρ(i) − 1∣∣.
With the obtained estimates (φ̂(r), τ̂ (r)), r = 1, ..., L pre-
sented in Sections 3.1 and 3.3, one can easily retrieve the as-
sociated (θ̂p,l, τ̂p,l), p = 1, ...,P , l = 1, ..., Lp through the
one-to-one mapping between r and (p, l). Substituting the ob-
tained estimates (θ̂p,l, τ̂p,l) as well as the obtained estimates
α̂p,l presented in Section 3.5 into (8) and (7) yields
Â(k) = A(k)ΛP, (41)
where P is a P × P permutation matrix and
Λ = diag(ejϕ1 , ..., ejϕP ). (42)
Note that both the permutation matrix P and the phase ambi-
guity matrix Λ are the same for all k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, and
they can be eliminated by use of only one pilot subcarrier for
each user within one OFDM block.
4. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section some simulation results are presented to demon-
strate the efficacy of the proposed blind channel estimation
algorithm. Consider a two-user (P = 2) OFDM system with
system parameters N ∈ {64, 256, 1024}, Ng = 20 and Q =
10. The total number of paths for each user is Lp = 3, and
thus L = L1 + L2 = 6; path gains αp,l are zero-mean com-
plex Gaussian (i.e., Rayleigh fading); time delays τp,l are
uniformly distributed over {0, 1, ..., Ng}; DOA θp,l are uni-
formly distributed over (−pi/2, pi/2].
For each simulated value of Input SNR defined as
Input SNR =
E{‖x[n]−w[n]‖2}
P · E{‖w[n]‖2} ,

ABSTRACT
This paper considers blind beamforming of multiuser orthogonal fre-
quency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Assuming that the
channel is static within one OFDM block, a blind post-FFT multi-
stage beamforming algorithm (MSBFA) based on subcarrier averag-
ing over one OFDM block is proposed, which basically comprises: i)
source (path) extraction using a hybrid beamforming algorithm com-
posed of a Fourier beamformer and a kurtosis maximization beam-
former, ii) time delay estimation and compensation, iii) classifica-
tion (path-to-user association) and blind maximum ratio combining
(of paths). The designed beamformer effectively utilizes multipath
diversity for performance gain, and is robust against the effects of
correlated sources. Some simulation results are presented to demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed MSBFA.
1. INTRODUCTION
The need for high transmission rate and guaranteed quality of ser-
vice has grown rapidly in wireless communication systems. To meet
this need, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in
conjunction with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal pro-
cessing has been considered for broadband communications, espe-
cially in the beamforming design of the receiver, such as the pre-FFT
beamforming structure (pre-FFT BFS) and post-FFT beamforming
structure (post-FFT BFS) [1–3]. The nonblind minimum mean square
error (MMSE) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) beamformers
require the channel information estimated in advance through the use
of pilot signals resulting in reduced spectral efficiency. Thus, blind
beamforming algorithms without pilot signals are preferable [2, 4].
Some blind beamforming algorithms associated with the post-
FFT BFS have been reported such as the subspace-based method
proposed by Zeng and Ng [4] and the conventional fast kurtosis max-
imization algorithm (FKMA) proposed by Chi et al. [5,6]. However,
they require a set of N beamformers (where N is the total number
of subcarriers) each for a subcarrier and the channel to be static over
multiple OFDM blocks. Recently, Peng et al. [2] proposed a single-
user blind beamforming algorithm by kurtosis maximization based
on subcarrier averaging over one OFDM block associated with the
post-FFT BFS to combat co-channel interference, where the desired
signals are significantly stronger than the interfering signals, under
a channel condition of no correlated sources. Moreover, users’ data
sequences must be independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary
phase-shift keying (BPSK) symbol sequences.
Our work can be regarded as a multiuser generalization of [2]
provided that the carrier frequency synchronization is perfect. We

Grants NSC 95-2218-E-007-110 and NSC 95-2219-E-007-004.
propose a novel block-by-block blind beamforming algorithm asso-
ciated with the post-FFT BFS for multiuser OFDM systems based on
subcarrier averaging. The designed beamformer is exactly the same
for all the subcarriers, is applicable to both the BPSK case and the
quadriphase-shift keying (QPSK) case, effectively utilizes multipath
diversity for performance gain, and is also robust against the effects
of correlated sources.
2. MIMO MODELS
Consider the uplink of a quasi-synchronous multiuser OFDM sys-
tem [4] with P active users where each mobile unit has a single
transmit antenna and the base station is equipped with a uniform
linear array of Q elements equally spaced by half a carrier wave-
length of the radio. The baseband discrete-time transmitted OFDM
signal from user p after serial-to-parallel (S/P) conversion, N -point
IFFT operation, parallel-to-serial (P/S) conversion, and insertion of
a guard interval (GI) of length equal to Ng (< N/2) is known to be
sp[n] =
1
N
N−1X
k=0
up[k]e
j2pikn/N (1)
for n = −Ng, ..., N − 1, where up[k] is the data sequence of user
p. For ease of later use, let us define the following notations:
θp,l : direction of arrival (DOA) of the lth path of user p
a(θp,l) : Q× 1 steering vector of user p with DOA θp,l
αp,l : path gain of user p with DOA θp,l
τp,l : time delay (in samples) of user p with DOA θp,l
Lp : total number of paths (or DOAs) of user p.
The baseband discrete-time received signal can be expressed as
x[n] =
PX
p=1
LpX
l=1
αp,la(θp,l)sp[n− τp,l] +w[n] (2)
for n = −Ng, ..., N − 1, where w[n] is a Q× 1 noise vector.
Next, let us make some general assumptions for the received
signal x[n] given by (2) as follows:
(A1) u1[k], . . . , uP [k] are i.i.d. QPSK symbol sequences, and
uq[k] is statistically independent of up[k] for q 6= p.
(A2) θq,m 6= θp,l for all (q,m) 6= (p, l); L = L1+ ...+LP (total
number of paths of all the users) and Q ≥ L.
(A3) τp,l ∈ {0, ..., Ng} for all p and l (quasi-synchronous OFDM
system) and τp,1 < ... < τp,Lp .
(A4) w[n] is zero-mean Gaussian, and is statistically independent
of up[k], p = 1, ..., P .

which is nothing but the magnitude of the normalized cross corre-
lation between a(eθ) and ba(r) and 0 ≤ ρ(a(eθ), ba(r)) ≤ 1. As
mentioned above, eθ and ba(r) are estimates of θ(r) and α(r)a(θ(r)),
respectively, implying the following remark.
Remark 4: The better the estimation accuracy of both eθ and ba(r)
(i.e., the better performance of the associated blind beamformer), the
larger the value of ρ(a(eθ), ba(r)).
Next, let us present how to extract a path signal in u[k] based
on subcarrier averaging over one OFDM block, involving a Fourier
beamformer and a kurtosis maximization beamformer (KMBF).
3.1. Fourier Beamformer by Subcarrier Averaging
The Fourier beamformer by subcarrier averaging is given by
vFB =
1√
Q
a(eθ), (23)
and its output is eFB[k] = vHFBx[k]. Then the associated channel
estimate baFB can be obtained by (21) with e[k] replaced by eFB[k]
and the corresponding blind performance index
ρFB = ρ(a(eθ), baFB). (by (22)) (24)
3.2. KMBF by Subcarrier Averaging
The kurtosis of u(i)[k] by subcarrier averaging is defined as
γ{u(i)[k]} = 〈|u(i)[k]|4〉−2(〈|u(i)[k]|2〉)2−|〈(u(i)[k])2〉|2. (25)
The objective function to be maximized for the design of the KMBF
v is defined as [2]
J(v) = J(e[k]) =
|γ{e[k]}|
(〈|e[k]|2〉)2 (26)
which is also called the magnitude of normalized kurtosis of beam-
former output e[k]. The optimum KMBF, denoted vKMBF, by max-
imizing J(v) (see (26)) is supported by Theorem 1 below for which
three more assumptions are needed as follows:
(A5) τp,j 6= (τp,i + τp,l)/2, ∀ p, if Lp ≥ 3, where i, j, l are
distinct integers.
(A6) τp,i+ τp,l 6= τp,j + τp,m, ∀ p, if Lp ≥ 4, where i, j, l, m are
distinct integers.
(A7) |τp,j − τp,i| 6= |τq,m − τq,l|, ∀ p 6= q, j 6= i, and m 6= l, if
Lp ≥ 2 and Lq ≥ 2.
Theorem 1. Under the assumptions (A1) through (A3), (A5) through
(A7), and the noise-free assumption, J(vKMBF) = max{J(v)}
p−→ 1, vKMBF p−→ bv, and bvHx[k] = β(r)u(r)[k] where β(r) 6= 0
is an unknown constant and r ∈ {1, ..., L} is an unknown integer.
The proof of Theorem 1 is also omitted due to page limit. Al-
though the objective function J(v) given by (26) is a highly nonlin-
ear function of v without closed-form solutions, fortunately, the op-
timum vKMBF, and eKMBF[k] = vHKMBFx[k] can be efficiently ob-
tained through the same fashion of the conventional iterative FKMA
[5, 6] (simply with ensemble averages replaced by subcarrier aver-
ages), initialized by an initial condition v(0) = vFB. Then the as-
sociated channel estimate baKMBF can be obtained by (21) with e[k]
replaced by eKMBF[k] and the corresponding blind performance in-
dex
ρKMBF = ρ(a(eθ), baKMBF). (by (22)) (27)
3.3. Fourier-KMBF by Subcarrier Averaging
We empirically found that the KMBF performs better than the Fourier
beamformer (both based on subcarrier averaging), but the former re-
quires three extra assumptions (A5), (A6) and (A7). It may occur
that these three assumptions may not be valid all the time in prac-
tice, thus limiting the use of the KMBF. This motivates the follow-
ing two-step hybrid Fourier-KMBF which is free from these three
assumptions:
(S1) Obtain eFB[k] = vHFBx[k], baFB and ρFB as presented in
Section 3.1, and obtain eKMBF[k] = vHKMBFx[k], baKMBF
and ρKMBF as presented in Section 3.2.
(S2) Let ρmax = max{ρFB, ρKMBF}. If ρmax > η, then obtain
(e[k], ba) =  (eKMBF[k], baKMBF), if ρKMBF > ρFB
(eFB[k], baFB), if ρFB > ρKMBF,
(28)
otherwise no source (with enough power) can be extracted,
where η is a preassigned threshold.
Remark 5: This two-step Fourier-KMBF is an automatic selec-
tion scheme by the performance of the Fourier beamformer and the
KMBF by Remark 4. When any of the assumptions (A5), (A6) and
(A7) does not hold true, the selection scheme (28) will switch to the
Fourier beamformer since ρFB > ρKMBF in this case. Therefore,
the three extra assumptions (A5), (A6) and (A7) can be relaxed (i.e.,
removed).
4. PROPOSED BLIND MSBFA
Under Assumptions (A1) through (A4), the proposed blind MSBFA
basically includes source (path) extraction, time delay estimation
and compensation, classification (path-to-user association) and blind
maximum ratio combining (BMRC) (of paths) which are presented
next, respectively.
4.1. Multistage Source Extraction Using Fourier-KMBF
Assume that the source estimate e`−1[k] and the channel estimateba`−1 are obtained at stage ` − 1 and that x`−1[k] is the MIMO
signal deflated from x[k] at stage `− 1. At the `th stage,
x`[k] = x`−1[k]− ba`−1e`−1[k]. (29)
First, obtain a distinct DOA estimate eθ = bθ(r) by (19) with x[k]
replaced by x`[k], and then calculate vFB by (23). Then obtain
(e`[k], ba`) (see (28)) using the proposed Fourier-KMBF, where
e`[k] = bu(r)[k] ' β`up(r)[k]e−j2pikτ(r)/N (by (12)) (30)
in which β` is an unknown constant, r ∈ {1, ..., L} is unknown and
r maps to p(r) uniquely (by (16)). Note that x1[k] = x[k] and
the extracted source e`[k] is free from error propagation since x[k]
instead of x`[k] is processed by the Fourier-KMBF at each stage.
4.2. Time Delay Estimation and Compensation (TDEC)
The unknown time delay τ (r) in the extracted source e`[k] (see (30))
can be estimated by subcarrier averaging as
bτ (r) = arg max
0≤τ≤Ng
{φ(e`[k], ej2pikτ/N )}, (31)
lines) because of path diversity gain only achieved by the former (see
Remark 1). Note that the performance of the Capon’s MV beam-
former using the true covariance matrix, called theoretic Capon’s
MV beamformer (♦ and dashed line), is actually the same as the
MMSE beamformer (4 and dashed line) associated with the pre-
FFT BFS and they perform better than the Capon’s MV beamformer
using the estimated covariance matrix, called actual Capon’s MV
beamformer (∇ and dashed line). Moreover, the proposed blind
MSBFA(© and solid line) works well with better performance than
the MRC beamformer (¤ and solid line) associated with the post-
FFT BFS, although the performance of the former is slightly worse
than that of the MMSE beamformer associated with the post-FFT
BFS (4 and solid line).
Example 2. (Environment with Correlated Sources)
For this example, the simulation was conducted with each path in
Example 1 replaced by a cluster of four paths (i.e., Lp,l = 4 for all p
and l), and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3. Basically,
all the observations from Fig. 2 also apply to Fig. 3. Besides, all the
beamformers under test perform better for higher input SNR except
the Capon’s MV beamformer (either theoretical one or actual one),
which performs worse (better) for higher input SNR as input SNR is
higher (lower) than 4 dB, demonstrating that it is not applicable in
the presence of correlated sources.
The above simulation examples demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed blind MSBFA, whereas no comparison with other block-
by-block post-FFT beamforming algorithms for multiuser OFDM
systems since, to our best knowledge, none of them can be found
in the open literature.
6. CONCLUSION
Under Assumptions (A1) through (A4), we have presented a block-
by-block blind post-FFT beamforming algorithm based on subcar-
rier averaging (the blind MSBFA), which is well suited to outdoor
rural environments with some but not too many multiple paths, for
the estimation of symbol sequences of all the users of an OFDM sys-
tem. It is also a multistage blind beamforming algorithm consisting
of source extraction using the proposed blind Fourier-KMBF, TDEC
processing, classification and BMRC processing at each stage. Some
simulation results were provided to support that the proposed blind
MSBFA performs well no matter whether correlated path signals are
present or not, and its performance is close to the “optimal” nonblind
MMSE beamformer associated with the post-FFT BFS.

dimensional space is straightforward.) Let si = (xi, yi),
i = 1, 2, · · · ,M , be the position of the ith sensor.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the positions
of the ﬁrst k of them, s1, s2, · · · , sk, where k ≥ 3, are
known. The task is to ﬁnd si, i = k+1, k+2, · · · ,M .
To derive our proposed positioning approach, we ﬁrst
let the distance between the ith sensor and jth sensor
be di,j , given by:
di,j = dj,i =
√
(xi − xj)2 + (yi − yj)2,
i, j = 1, 2, · · · ,M. (1)
Let mCn = m!/[n!(m − n)!], and consider a matrix
X ∈ R(MC2−kC2)×2 which contains all the differences
of xi − xj and yi − yj , i > j, with at least one of
the si and sj being unknown. Mathematically, X is
represented as
X =

matrix X can be expressed a linear combination of

of X.
The subspace method to be presented is based on
examining the subspace and rank properties of the so-
called multidimensional similarity matrix [13]
D = XXT (4)
The rank of D is rankD = rankX = 2. The matrix D
is constructed from {di,j} using the following formula:
D = −0.5KRKT (5)

i = k + 1, k + 2, · · · ,M
and
ei,j = ei − ej
with 0i×j and ei denote respectively, the i × j zero
matrix and the ith column of IM . Since D is sym-
metric, positive semideﬁnite, and of rank 2, it can be
decomposed using eigenvalue factorization as
D = UsΛsUTs + UnΛnU
T
n (6)
where Λs = diag (λ1, λ2)  0, Λn =
diag (λ3, · · · , λMC2−kC2) with λ3 = λ4 = · · · =
λ
MC2−kC2 = 0 and the columns of Us ∈
R(MC2−kC2)×2 and Un ∈ R(MC2−kC2)×(MC2−kC2−2) are
called the signal and noise eigenvectors, respectively.
As X lies in the signal subspace Us, we have
UTnX = 0(MC2−kC2−2)×2 (7)
or by (3)
2(M−k)∑
i=1
φiUTnXi = −UTnX0. (8)
When disturbance is present, noise-free distances {di,j}
are available only for k ≥ i > j ≥ 1. In our study,
we generalize all the observed distance measurements,
denoted by ri,j , as
ri,j = rj,i = di,j + qi,j
where qi,j = qj,i is the possible zero-mean noise with
variance σ2i,j ≥ 0 if max(i, j) = k + 1, k + 2, · · · ,M ,
and σ2i,j = 0 otherwise with max(i, j) = i if i ≥ j.
This means that for practical purposes, {ri,j} will
be substituted for {di,j} in (5) when the latter is
unavailable in forming D. As a result, the equal signs
in (7) and (8) should be replaced by the approximate

In principle, any matrix function satisfying (1) and (2) is said
to be an OSTBC. In practice, most existing OSTBCs are based
on generalized orthogonal designs (GODs) [7–9], which have ad-
ditional restrictions on the code structures. In real GODs, for
instance, the entries of C(s) are constrained to be drawn from
{0,±s1, . . . ,±sK} thereby Xk ∈ {0,±1}Mt×T for all k. For
example, the BPSK Alamouti code
C(s) =
[
s1 −s2
s2 s1
]
(4)
is a GOD. The analysis here is established from (1) and (2), and
GODs will not be assumed unless speci¿ed. Hence our analysis is
also applicable to non-GOD codes (e.g., the ‘sporadic’ codes [7]).
2.2. Blind ML Detection and Blind Identi¿ability
We consider a standard scenario [2] where a sequence of OSTBCs
is transmitted over a frequency-Àat, quasi-static channel. The re-
spective received signal model is given by
Yp = HC(sp) + Vp, p = 1, . . . , P, (5)
whereYp ∈ CMr×T is the received code matrix at pth code block,
sp ∈ {±1}
K is the transmitted bit vector at the pth code block,
H ∈ CMr×Mt is the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
channel, Mr is the number of receiver antennas, P is the frame
length or number of code blocks in which the channel remains
static, and Vp ∈ CMr×T is an additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) matrix. Let
S = [ s1, . . . , sP ] ∈ {±1}
K×P , (6)
and assume that H is a deterministic unknown. The blind ML
detector is given by [2, 4]
{Hˆ, Sˆ} = arg min
H˜∈CMr×Mt ,
S˜∈{±1}K×P
P∑
p=1
‖Yp − H˜C(s˜p)‖
2
F (7)
where the unknown H and S are estimated jointly. Here ‖.‖F
stands for the Frobenius norm.
If C(.) is simply a linear dispersion code satisfying (1), then
solving (7) would be dif¿cult. It has been shown [2] that by ex-
ploiting the code orthogonality in (3), Problem (7) can simpli¿ed
to a Boolean quadratic program
Sˆ = arg max

(8)
where Gpq ∈ RK×K with [Gpq ]k = Re{tr{YpXHk XYHq }}
(While (8) leads to Sˆ only, Hˆ can be computed directly from Sˆ if
necessary; see [2, 4]). Problem (8) can then be handled subopti-
mally by either the closed-form method [1,3] or the quasi-optimal
SDR method [2]. Alternatively, (8) can be solved optimally by a
sphere decoding algorithm [2]. Some performance and complexity
aspects of the various algorithms have been reported in [2].
The implementation simplicity of blind ML OSTBC detection
motivates us to investigate the blind identi¿ability aspects, stated
as follows: Suppose that the true channel H and data matrix S is
a solution of the blind ML problem in (7). This desired solution
is unique only when we cannot ¿nd another solution, denoted by
{H˜, S˜}, such that
HC(sp) = H˜C(s˜p), p = 1, . . . , P. (9)
An obvious situation leading to (9) is when {H˜, S˜} =
{−H,−S}. Sign ambiguity is an inherent problem, but can be
¿xed easily by a number of ways; e.g., setting one element of S to
be a pilot. Given {H,S}, we say that S is uniquely identi¿able up
to a sign if (9) does not hold for any {H˜, S˜} = ±{H,S}. In the
next section, we will consider the class of the NIS-OSTBCs and
its blind identi¿ability.
3. NONINTERSECTING SUBSPACE OSTBCS
This section contains the main results of this paper. In the ¿rst
subsection we de¿ne the NIS-OSTBCs and study their properties.
The second subsection proposes an NIS-OSTBC construction pro-
cedure. The proof leading to our construction procedure is detailed
in the third subsection.
3.1. Nonintersecting Subspace Codes and Their Properties
LetR(A) denote the range space ofA. The following is our def-
inition for a nonintersecting subspace (NIS) OSTBC:
De¿nition 1 An OSTBC is said to be a NIS-OSTBC if
R(CT (s)) ∩ R(CT (s˜)) = {0} (10)
for every s, s˜ ∈ {±1}K , s = ±s˜.
The NIS concepts were introduced in the noncoherent space-time
coding literature [5] for achieving the full noncoherent spatial di-
versity in an i.i.d. Rayleigh channel. Up to this point there is no
study regarding the existence and construction of NIS-OSTBCs,
which is the subject of this paper. From a blind identi¿ability
standpoint, NIS-OSTBCs are ‘perfect’ blind space-time codes:
Theorem 1 Given every nonzero channel H ∈ CMr×Mt and
data matrix S ∈ {±1}K×P , S is uniquely identi¿able up to a
sign if and only ifC(.) is an NIS-OSTBC.
Proof: One can verify easily that to avoid the channel-code am-
biguity in (9) for any S ∈ {±1}K×P , H ∈ CMr×Mt \ {0}, it
is suf¿cient and necessary that the following statement holds: For
every pair of bit vectors (s, s˜) with s = ±s˜, the condition
h
T
C(s) = h˜TC(s˜) (11)
holds for any h, h˜ ∈ CMt \ {0}. By noting that
R(CT (s)) ∩R(CT (s˜)) ={
y
∣∣∣ y = CT (s)h = CT (s˜)h˜, for some h, h˜ ∈ CMt} (12)
and by comparing (12) and (11), we conclude that (11) is equiva-
lent to haveR(CT (s)) ∩ R(CT (s˜)) = {0} for any s = ±s˜. 
There is a price for using NIS-OSTBCs, however.
Lemma 1 Suppose that C(.) is a real or complex GOD. If C(.)
is also an NIS-OSTBC, then it does not achieve the full rate; i.e.,
K < T for real GODs and K/2 < T for complex GODs.

If Q1 − Q2 is singular, then at least one of its eigenvalues has
to be 0. From (26), the eigenvalues of Q1 − Q2 are given by
λi(Q1−Q2) = γ+λi(B1−B2), i = 1, . . . ,Mt. SinceB1−B2
is skew-Hermitian, its eigenvalues λi(B1 − B2) are either pure
imaginary or zero [11]. Hence, to have a singular Q1 − Q2 it is
necessary that γ = 0. Since K is even, we can write K = 2m
for some integerm. Likewise, α2 can be represented by α2 = 2c
where c ∈ {0,±1, . . . ,±m}. The condition γ = 0 implies that

From (24) α1 is an odd number, but Eq. (28) indicates that α1 is
not an integer unless c = 0 or c = ±m. For c = 0 we have
α1 = 0, a contradiction. For c = ±m, we have α1 = ±(K −
1) and α2 = ±K. Such a condition can only be satis¿ed when
[ μT νT ]T = ±[ μ˜T ν˜T ]T , a contradiction to s = ±s˜.
4. SIMULATION RESULTS
This simulation example compares the performance of the origi-
nal and modi¿ed OSTBC transmission schemes. The numbers of
transmitter and receiver antennas are Mt = 3 and Mr = 1, re-
spectively. The code matrix is the one in (13). In the simulation,
the channel is i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian distributed. The blind re-
ceiver employed here is the SDR-ML [2] (note that the other blind
ML implementations could also be used, but with the page limit
only SDR-ML is considered). The sign ambiguity effect is elim-
inated by assuming that one of the bit symbols is known at the
receiver.
The results were plotted in Fig. 1. In the ¿gure, we also show
the performance of differential OSTBC [12, 13], another effec-
tive noncoherent space-time technique. We see that the modi¿ed
scheme has a substantially better bit error performance than the
original scheme. It also yields better performance than the differ-
ential scheme for P ≥ 8, by about 1.5dB when P = 16.
Fig. 1 also reveals that the modi¿ed scheme achieves the full
noncoherent spatial diversity, as promised by its NIS characteris-
tic. In essence, the bit error probability of the modi¿ed scheme
is observed to be decaying at the same rate as that of the coherent
ML. However, such a decaying rate is lower in the original scheme.
5. CONCLUSION
The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we have exam-
ined the impacts of NIS-OSTBCs on blind ML space-time coding.
In particular, our analysis has shown that NIS-OSTBCs are an at-
tractive class of blind space-time codes, in the sense that they are
uniquely identi¿able up to a sign for any nonzero channel. Sec-
ond, we have derived an NIS-OSTBC construction procedure. The
procedure works by applying a simple modi¿cation to an existing
OSTBC, and is very easy to use.

In the paper, our interest lies in jointly estimating H and detecting
s from Y . As mentioned and clariﬁed in Sec. 1, the signiﬁcance of
this investigation is in the block fading scenario where H may not
be the same for each OSTBC-OFDM block.
3. SEMIBLIND ML DETECTION
We consider the deterministic semiblind ML criterion [10,11] where
part of s is known at the receiver. For simplicity, assume that the ﬁrst
M subchannels contain pilots (generalization to other pilot place-
ments is straightforward). Let
s = [sTp , s
T
d ]
T ∈ {±1}NcK , (10)
where sp = [sT1 , ..., sTM ]
T stands for the pilot data and sd =
[sTM+1, ..., s
T
Nc ]
T denotes the unknown data. Then the semiblind
ML detector is given by
{sˆd, Hˆ} = arg min
sd ∈ {±1}(Nc−M)K
H ∈ CLNt×Nr
||Y − C(s)H||2F , (11)
where || · ||F denotes the Frobenius norm. We present a data iden-
tiﬁability analysis for (11), followed by the implementation method
of the semiblind ML detector. It will be shown in Sec. 3.1 that the
data identiﬁability can be guaranteed in a probability one sense when
there is one pilot code transmitted, i.e., M = 1. Regarding the re-
alization issue, in the next subsection, it is shown that (11) can be
reformulated as a Boolean quadratic program (BQP) where efﬁcient
implementation is possible [12].
3.1. Data Identiﬁability
To investigate the data identiﬁability, the signal model in (8) in the
absence of noise is considered
Y = C(s)H. (12)
It is clear that, in the absence of noise, {sd,H} is a solution pair
of (11). Suppose that there exist s′d ∈ {±1}(Nc−M)K and H′ ∈
C
LNt×Nr so that {s′d,H′} is also a solution pair of (11). Then
C(s′)H′ = C(s)H, (13)
where
s
′ = [sTp , s
′T
d ]
T ∈ {±1}NcK . (14)
To ensure the data identiﬁability, we analyze (13) and look for con-
ditions under which (13) holds only if {s′d,H′} = {sd,H}.
We start our analysis by considering that there are at leastL pilot
codes (i.e., M ≥ L). Let
Cp(sp) =


...
C(sM )


	


∈ CMT×LNt . (15)
From (13) and (15), one can obtain
Cp(sp)H′ = Cp(sp)H. (16)
It is not hard to show that Cp(sp) is of full column rank for M ≥ L.
Hence, (16) results in H′ = H, i.e., the channel can be uniquely
identiﬁed. However, channel identiﬁcation does not imply data iden-
tiﬁcation because, if Hn = 0 for some n, then the data sn can never
be recovered even when full CSI is available. However, the probabil-
ity that this channel nullity occurs is quite low for an MIMO fading
channel. Let us consider the following channel assumption:
A1) The channel H is Gaussian distributed and at least one column
of H has a positive deﬁnite covariance matrix.
One can see that independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh
fading channels satisfy A1). Under A1), one can show that the
probability of the event {Hn = 0} is of measure zero. Thus we
conclude that the data can be identiﬁed with probability one if there
are at least L pilot codes. In practice, given M ≥ L, the channel can
be estimated by a least-squares (LS) channel estimator [10, 15]
Hˆ =

where YM = [YT1 , ...,YTM ]T .
In the paper, instead of usingL pilot codes, we show that a single
pilot code is sufﬁcient to ensure probability one data identiﬁability.
Let us look at the following lemma:
Lemma 1: Assume that A1) holds and that there is no noise. Sup-
pose that C(s) satisﬁes the following condition:
C1) Let s′ = [sTp , s′Td ]T ∈ {±1}NcK . There does not exist a
matrix U ∈ CLNt×LNt such that
C(s′)U = C(s), (18)
for any s′d = sd.
Then the data sd can be uniquely identiﬁed with probability one.
The proof of Lemma 1 is given in the Appendix. One can see that
the aforementioned LS method (which uses at least L pilot codes) is
an approach to make C1) hold and thereby can have the probability
one data identiﬁability. However, by exploiting the special structure

Substituting (28) into (13) yields
 C(s)− C(s′)UH = 0. (29)
Let Φ = C(s) − C(s′)U. Under C1), we have Φ = 0. The proba-

for some i, where ei ∈ RNr denotes a unit vector with the ith en-
try equal to unity. According to A1), let the ith column of H be
Gaussian distributed with a positive deﬁnite covariance matrix. Then
one can show that Pr {ΦHei = 0} is of measure zero. Hence, (13)
holds with probability zero. Therefore, the data sd can be uniquely
identiﬁed with probability one. 

3. NEW BSS CRITERION BY CONVEX ANALYSIS
In this section, we ¿rst review some convex analysis concepts essen-
tial to this work, and then present our main results.
3.1. Some Basic Concepts of Convex Analysis
We review two convex analysis concepts [9], [10] that will play an
important role to the ensuing development. The ¿rst is the af¿ne hull
of a set of vectors {s1, . . . , sN} ⊂ RL, de¿ned as
aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} =   x =
N

i=1
θisi 



θ ∈ RN ,
N

i=1
θi = 1  .
(4)
For N = 2, the af¿ne hull is a line passing through s1 and s2; see
Fig. 1(a). The af¿ne hull can always be represented by an af¿ne set:
aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} =  x = Cα + d


α ∈ RP  (5)
for some (non-unique) d ∈ RL andC ∈ RL×P . Here,C is assumed
to be of full column rank and P represents the dimension of the
af¿ne set which must be less than N . For example, if {s1, . . . , sN}
is a linearly independent set, then P = N − 1. In that case, a
legitimate (C,d) can simply be obtained by C = [ s1 − sN , s2 −
sN , . . . , sN−1 − sN ] and d = sN . In the ensuing subsections we
will be faced with the problem of ¿nding (C,d) from {s1, . . . , sN}
for P < N − 1.
The second key concept is that of the convex hull of a set of
vectors {s1, . . . , sN} ⊂ RL, de¿ned as
conv{s1, . . . , sN} =   x =
N

i=1


i=1
θi = 1  .
(6)
ForN = 2, the convex hull is a line segment between s1 and s2; see
Fig. 1(a). Geometrically s1, . . . , sN would be the ‘corner points’
of its convex hull, de¿ned formally as the extreme points. A point
x ∈ conv{s1, . . . , sN} is an extreme point of conv{s1, . . . , sN}
if it cannot be a nontrivial convex combination of s1, . . . , sN ; i.e.,
x =

i=1
θisi (7)
for all θ ∈ RN+ ,  Ni=1 θi = 1, and θ = ei for any i (where ei
is the unit vector with the ith entry being equal to 1). The set of
extreme points of conv{s1, . . . , sN} must be either the full set or
a subset of {s1, . . . , sN}. In addition, if {s1, . . . , sN} is a linearly
independent set, then the set of extreme points of conv{s1, . . . , sN}
is exactly {s1, . . . , sN}.

3.2. Signal Af¿ne Hull Characterization
With the aforedescribed convex analysis concepts, we see from the
signal formulation in (3) and (A3) that
xi ∈ aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} (8)
for all i = 1, . . . ,M . This leads to an interesting question whether
the observations x1, . . . ,xM provide suf¿cient information to deter-
mine the source signal af¿ne hull aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN}. This is indeed
possible, as described in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. Suppose that (A3) and (A4) hold. Then,
aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} = aﬀ{x1, . . . ,xM}. (9)
The proof of Lemma 1 is omitted due to the page limit. Fig. 1(b)
demonstrates geometrically the validity of Lemma 1. We will show
later that given knowledge of aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN}, it is possible to per-
fectly recover all s1, . . . , sN . Now let us focus on characteriza-
tion of aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN}. It can easily be shown from (A2) that
{s1, . . . , sN} is linearly independent. Hence, aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} has
dimension N − 1 and admits a representation
aﬀ{s1, . . . , sN} =  x = Cα + d


α ∈ RN−1   A(C,d)
(10)
for some (C,d) ∈ RL×(N−1) × RL such that rank(C) = N − 1.
Note that (C,d) is non-unique. Without loss of generality, we can
restrictC to a semi-unitary matrix, i.e.,CTC = I.
It is easy to obtain (C,d) from the observations x1, . . . ,xM if
M = N ; see the example mentioned in Section 3.1. The nontrivial
case lies inM > N , for which a method, referred to as the af¿ne set
¿tting, is proposed next.
Consider the following projection problem
min
C˜,d˜
C˜
T
C˜=I
M

i=1
‖xi −PA(C˜,d˜)(xi)‖

where ‖.‖2 denotes the 2-norm; andPA(x) stands for the projection
of x onto the setA, de¿ned as
PA(x) = arg min
x˜∈A
‖x − x˜‖22. (12)
The idea behind is to ¿nd an (N − 1)-dimensional af¿ne set that has
the minimum projection error with respect to the observations. At
¿rst glance, (11) is a nonconvex optimization problem, but in fact it
can be solved analytically as stated in the following proposition:
Proposition 1. The af¿ne set ¿tting problem in (11) has a closed
form solution
d =

M
M

i=1
xi (13)
C = [ q1(UU
T ), q2(UU
T ), . . . , qN−1(UU
T ) ] (14)
whereU = [ x1 − d, . . . ,xM − d ] ∈ RL×M , and qi(R) denotes
the eigenvector associated with the ith principal eigenvalue ofR.
The proof of Proposition 1 is given in Section 7. We should add
that the af¿ne set ¿tting solution in Proposition 1 works for M =
N as well. Moreover, in the presence of noise the af¿ne set ¿tting
would serve as a favorable way for noise reduction, since it provides
a best af¿ne set that achieves the minimum data ¿tting error.
III ­ 962
Note that 0 ≤ ρ˜ ≤ 1 and the larger ρ˜, the better the performance
of the algorithm under test. Three correlated human face image
sources (N = 3) taken from the benchmarks in [2] were used
to generate three noise-free observations and ¿fteen noisy observa-
tions. Note that we add zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance
σ2i to produce noisy observations with the same signal-to-noise ra-
tio (SNR=SNRi=25dB) where SNRi = ‖ xi ‖22/Lσ2i . To maintain
non-negativity of the observations in the simulation, we force the
negative noisy observations to zero. The averaged values of ρ˜ over
the performed ¿fty independent runs are displayed in Table 1. From
this table, one can see that proposed method performs better than the
other three existing algorithms (i.e., maximum averaged ρ˜).

6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTUREWORKS
We have developed a new blind separation criterion for non-negative
sources by a convex analysis approach. This approach is determinis-
tic and geometry-based, requiring no source independence assump-
tion. Based on the new criterion (Theorem 1), a BSS method (for
N = 2 and N = 3) has been proposed. Some experimental results
reveal that the proposed BSS method outperforms nLCA, nICA, and
NMF. As future directions, we shall consider extension to the case
ofN > 3 and investigate relaxations of the assumptions made in the
paper.

J(C˜, d˜) is a convex optimization problem. By solv-

J(C˜, d˜) = 0 for d˜ with a given C˜, we obtain an optimal

Proof of Lemma 2. Assume that z ∈ aﬀ{s1, ..., sN} ∩ RL+:
z =
N
 
i=1
θisi 
 0, 1
T
θ = 1.
From (A2), it follows that z[i] = θisi[i] ≥ 0, ∀i. Since si[i] >
0, we must have θi ≥ 0, ∀i. Therefore, z lies in conv{s1, ..., sN}.
On the other hand, assume that z ∈ conv{s1, ..., sN}, i.e.,
z =
N
 
i=1
θisi 
 0, 1
T
θ = 1, θ 
 0
implying that z ∈ aﬀ{s1, ..., sN}. From (A1), we have si 
 0 ∀i
and subsequently z 
 0. This completes the proof for (16). More-
over, the fact that s1, ..., sN are linearly independent (according to
(A2)) implies that {s1, ..., sN} is the set of all the extreme points of
conv{s1, ..., sN} (cf., Sec. 3.1).
Proof of Lemma 3. Equation (18) can also be expressed as
F =   α ∈ RN−1 |Cα + d ∈ conv{s1, ..., sN}  .
Thus, every α ∈ F satis¿es
Cα + d =
N

i=1
θisi. (25)
for some θ 
 0, θT1 = 1. Now, due to the one-to-one mapping
si = Cαi + d ∈ S (between S and F), one can infer that (25) is
equivalent to
α =
N

i=1
θiαi, θ
T
1 = 1, θ 
 0 (26)
meaning that F = conv{α1, ..., αN}. Now, suppose that α1 is not
an extreme point, i.e., α1 =  Ni=1 θiαi, θ = e1. Then one can
easily show that s1 = Cα1 + d =  Ni=1 θisi, θ = e1, i.e., s1
is not an extreme point (contradiction). So, all αi must be extreme
points of F .
