I. Introduction of Glass-Ceramics Systems for Sealing of SOFC 
Glass and glass-ceramic materials are the most common sealants used in 
SOFC. The glass-ceramic systems can be shaped as easy as a molten glass, and as 
strong as a polycrystalline ceramics. Several glass-ceramics, e.g. VycorTM, are well 
known and being widely applied in advanced applications.[1] 
There are several stringent requirements in mechanical, chemical and 
electrical aspects for the selection of a suitable glass or glass-ceramic sealants. Three 
properties are very fundamental for the glass. One is the glass transition 
temperature (Tg) and the other is the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the 
glass-ceramics. The glass transition temperature is important to allow the glass to 
flow sufficiently and to provid an adequate sealing function, while maintaining 
sufficient rigidity for mechanical integrity (compliant sealing). The coefficient of 
thermal expansion (CTE) must match other cell components, such as the 
yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and the interconnect material, to minimize 
thermal stresses. Finally, the electric resistivity of the glass-ceramics should better be 
than 106 ohm/cm.  
     Various glasses and glass-ceramics with values of Tg and CTE in target range 
(~800oC) are shown in Table 1.1 designed for ZrO2 electrolyte. Many glasses and 
glass–ceramics contain alkali metal oxides [2,3]. Although they have suitable CTE 
close to YSZ, the oxides easily react with other fuel cell components and poor electric 
resistivity. For SOFC applications, alkaline-earth-based (especially the BaO) 
boro-silicate glasses are more commonly used. It has been shown to operate at  
higher temperature (800oC) more that 1000 h without significant degradation.[4] The

Only five US patents have been found relating to the sealing glasses used for 
SOFC (Table 1.2). They have the claims covered the glass compositions and the 
applications that are similar to previous study. The oxide ingredients are mainly 
silicate, doped with ZnO- or the other alkaline-earth oxides. It is difficult without 
infringing on the formulation ranges and claims of those patents.

Bi-glasses were synthesized from analytical grade fused silica, Bi2O3, ZnO and 
H3BO3. Batch formulations were calculated to produce 50 g glass sample in Pt 
crucible. An electric furnace was used for melting the batches at temperature 1200oC 
and quenched with water. The glasses were ground using an agate and sieved through 
a sieve of 150 mesh. Pellets were made by die-pressing of granulated glass powder. 
   The design of this work required only the sealing between the electrolyte and 
interconnect. Yttria-stabilized zirconia is a common material used as SOFC 
electrolyte. The YSZ plates were prepared from 8 mol% YSZ (TEAMCera, Taiwan) 
by pressure filtration, sintering, and polishing. 
 
2.2 Characterization of the Glass-Ceramics 
   The as-prepared glasses were analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (Philips PW 1972, 
Philips Instrument, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation to confirm the amorphous 
nature of glass.  
   The thermal properties of the glasses, such as glass transition temperature (Tg) and 
crystallization temperature (Tc) were measured using differential thermal analysis 
(DTA, DuPont, 1600DTA) in air at a heating rate of 5oC/min. CTE values of glass and 
glass-ceramic were measured by TMA (TMA 2940 Thermo-mechanical Analyzer 
(TA), DuPont, USA) 
    After thermal treatments glass-ceramic were characterized using XRD and 
scanning electron microscopy to investigate the crystallization behavior of the glasses. 
XRD measurements were performed to identify the precipitated crystalline phases and 
to observe the development of crystalline phases, which were evaluated from the 
comparison of the relative intensities of the largest peaks corresponding to each phase 
in the XRD patterns. SEM (Tungsten, Philips XL30,) observation on the polished 
surface of heat-treated glass was conducted to investigate microstructure changes 
causing by crystallization and at operation temperature.

    In brief, P1 glass has a low melting point (630oC) and the Pb2+ in the glass would 
diffuse into YSZ to form PbZrO3, poisoned electrolyte. It is not suitable as SOFC 
sealing glass. 
  
2.3.2 Properties of Bi-Glass Ceramics 
 16
 
In order to develop a good sealant, it is necessary to understand the crystallization 
behavior, sealing properties, and long-term stability at applied temperature. Fig. 2.6 
exemplified the XRD patterns of the B4 glass powder and treated at 650oC. The 
spectra of the as-casted glass exhibited broad diffraction intensity in the XRD pattern. 
 
Fig. 2.6 XRD patterns of glass B4 heat-treated at 650oC for various periods. 
 
    At 650oC holding for 10 min, column crystal Bi2SiO5 was found to be the main 
crystalline phase in the glass, as shown in Fig. 2.6(b). As the holding time was longer 
than 1 hr, Bi2SiO5 dissolved into glass phase and re-crystallized into Bi4(SiO4)3, 
Bi12SiO20, and Zn2SiO4 (Fig. 2.6(c)). Detail micro-observation showed four crystalline 
phases in Fig. 2.7(a). It is believed that all B2O3 content due to its glass forming 
ability forms the glassy boundary with Bi2O3 and ZnO ingredients. 
The diffusion of Bi-species into ZrO2 is noted in Fig. 2.8(b) along YSZ grain 
boundary, especially the interface without the growth of Zn2SiO4 crystals. The 
Zn2SiO4 layer next to ZrO2 seems play a role to block the transport of the Bi-B-Zn-O 
glass. The depth of the diffusion is limited to a few micrometers as holding for 10 hr. 
The maxima diffusion depth of the sample was 8 μm in average. The crystallization 
reaction sequence of the glass is proposed as follows. Bi2O3, ZnO, SiO2 and B2O3 
react at 650oC, only the Bi2SiO5 phase exists at the first moment.  The other elements 
forms glass phase in small quantity in the matrix, but still not able to creep at this 
temperature. As the time extends, the Bi2SiO5 phase either dissolves into the glass 
phase, then re-crystallizes a new phase Bi4(SiO4)3. During the crystallization, both  
Bi2O3 and ZnO in borosilicate glass had shown different diffusive results in YSZ. The

    (c) Creeping behavior analysis.   TMA (DTA, DuPund, 1600DTA) was 
employed to analyze the creeping behavior of glass. All samples were measured in air 
with a heating rate of 5oC/min. Fig. 2.10 shows the creeping behavior result of 
as-crystallized YSZ/glass/YSZ sandwich sample at 750, 700 and 650oC with a heating 
rate of 10oC/min and 8.5 kPa loading. The creeping rate is higher as the temperature is 
higher. A creeping rate (0.114 μm/hr) at 650oC supply sufficient viscous flow to 
healing the cracks. The viscous flow of glass can explain this phenomenon[1]. 
The creep rate was proportional to temperature. The viscosity can be estimate by 
eq. (1) [2-3].

Kovar, as shown in Fig.11. A porous oxidization layer formed at alloy surface, which 
has lower joining strength, cracked during sample preparation. Large amount of 
Fe-rich crystals were caused by FeO diffusing into the glass and inducing 
crystallization. It needs surface coating on Kovar surface to prevent oxidization and 
supply better joining strength.

inside the glass-ceramic body. So B4-glass/Crofer 22 appeared a weak bonding, 
needed improvement by reducing CTE mismatch, of which doped with ZrO2 will be

extending to 100 hr, a new phase Bi7.38Zr0.62O12.31 grown from glass phase was

III. Ba-glass Ceramic Systems  
Currently, glass-ceramics are the preferred materials in these restrict 
requirements for sealing SOFC stacks. With an effort to develop such a suitable 
sealant for planar SOFCs, borosilicate, boron-free alkaline earth silicates, and 
phosphorus silicate had been suggested in many scientific articles for SOFC sealing 
applications. Because P2O5 not only increases the crystallization tendency in most 
silicate glass for the long-term stability concerns, but also the phosphorus silicates 
exhibit low CTE value of 5-6 ppm/K, too  low to be a good candidate. Neither 
boron-free alkaline earth silicates were considered because of its high viscosities. 
Consequently, the present work would emphasize on borosilicate glass-ceramics.21 
3.1 Experiment of Ba-Glass Preparation 
3.1.1. Glass preparation 
To prepare a suitable sealing glass, B2O3 and SiO2 were chosen as a glass former. 
As Sohn et al. mentioned that B2O3 can decrease the viscosity and crystallization 
tendency of glasses. With increasing the B2O3/SiO2 ratio, the CTE of the sealing 
glasses also increase22.  Other component, BaO, as network modifier, can increase 
the CTE value and show a better glass formation ability with decreasing phase 
separation tendency. Al2O3, as an intermediate additive, can prevent rapid 
crystallization of a glass during heat-treatment and also to increase the surface tension 
of glass. 23,24,25 
The composition of the glass listed in Table 3.1 were prepared by taking 
stoichiometric amounts of reagent-grade BaCO3, H2BO3, SiO2, and Al2O3, then 
milling thoroughly in a turbo-mixer for 24 h in alcohol (10 vol％).

3.1.3 Bonding and Wetting Behavior  
YSZ (8 mol% Y2O3-dope ZrO2) was used as a substrate material for bonding and 
wetting test. The YSZ plates were prepared by colloidal filtration of the YSZ powder 
into pellet and sequentially sintering at 1600oC in air for 1 hr. 
To examine the bonding characteristic and wetting behavior of the glass to YSZ 
plate, the glass bulk was put on YSZ plate and continuously heated up to 1100oC at a 
heating rate of 10oC/min in air. The contact angle is defined as the angle formed by 
two planes tangential to the liquid (or glass) and solid phase surfaces at the site of 
contact between the two phases. The change of contact angles at various temperatures 
was recorded. 
 
3.1.4 Long-term operation stability 
In order to investigate long-term stability when the cells operate, the G1A10 
glass bulk was aging at the operation temperature, 650oC, and tested by XRD and 
TMA. 
 
3.1.5 Interface reaction 
To investigate the interface reaction between the glass/YSZ and glass/metallic 
interconnect (Crofer 22), the glass bulk placed on YSZ or Crofer 22 plates were first 
heated up to 1000oC at 10oC/min and held for 15 min to seal the glass and YSZ/Crofer 
22 plates together, then the specimens were cooled down and aging at 650oC for a 
period of time. After the heat-treatment, the cross section of the specimens was 
examined using SEM to investigate microstructure change of the interface as a result 
of long-term treatment. 
 
 3.1.6 Bonding Strength 
Bonding strength was measured from YSZ and Crofer 22 test bars with nominal 
depth, width and length of 5×5×20 mm3 adhered by the selected paste, which was 
dispersed in H2O with 1 wt % PVA. The YSZ to YSZ, Crofer 22 to Crofer 22, and 
YSZ to Crofer 22 adhered sample were tested at ambient temperature in air using the 
four-point flexure test method which is illustrated in Fig. 3.1, according to the 
recommendation in ASTM test standards C1161.26,27 A displacement rate of 0.01 
mm/s was applied in displacement control. A total of 3 test specimens were tested for 
each different sealing condition.

Fig. 3.3 Changes in Tg, Tc and Tm values of the G-series glass. The values were 
obtained from the DTA thermograms. 
 
In general, the thermal stress developed at the sealed interface is strongly 
affected by the difference of CTE values between bonded materials and the Tg of the 
sealants. When fuel-cell stacks coolrf down to room temperature, stress begins to 
develop at the sealed interface only as the temperature decreases below the Tg of the 
sealants. This might cause severe damage to the stacks. Consequently, the Tg value of 
a compliant glass should be lower than the operation temperature capable of relaxing 
 30
also plotted in Fig. 3.5.  
 
Fig. 3.5 XRD patterns of glasses heat-treated at 850oC for 10 and 100 hr to 
identify the crystalline phase. 
 
For G1A10, according to the Gibbs’ phase rule, four phases would be observed 
at equilibrium. Compareing the X-ray pattern with the SEM micrographs (Fig. 3.6) 
and EDS analysis, there existed three crystalline phases and one glass phase, which 
are hexacelsian (BaAl2Si2O8), monocelsian (BaAl2Si2O8), and barium silicates 
(BaSiO3). Their CTE values of these crystalline phases are listed in Table 3.2.  
Hexacelsian always precipitates first, and is more compatible with the parent glasses 
than it’s polymorph, monocelsian, in terms of CTE mismatch. According to this, the 
crystallization of hexacelsian is desirable for preparing a suitable sealant for SOFCs. 
But, the platy-like shape of the hexacelsian implies that the thermal expansion is not 
isotropic which would lead to cracking due to the hexacelsian crystals. In our detail 
observation, intergranular fractures along the hexacelsian happened and decreased the 
sealing strength. The fractures were also harmful to gas- tight ability of the seal.

preparing a reliable glass sealant. Since the shape change of glass occurs because of 
decreasing of the viscosity., which is a function of temperature. According to Table 
3.1, G1A10 glass shows a higher Tg value than that of G0 and G0A5 glasses. Fig. 3.7 
shows the shape change of three glass bulks: G0, G0A5, and G1A10, placed on the 
YSZ plate at heating rate of 10oC/min. G0 and G05A glasses with a higher B2O3/SiO2 
ratio and lower Al2O3 additive, started wetting at 1050 oC and 1000 oC, but G1A10 
started wetting at 800oC. This is because of a crystalline phase growing in G0 and 
G0A5 at 580oC, which would result in a higher wetting temperature and  viscosity.

Fig. 3.8 shows the more detailed shape change behavior of the G1A10 bulks

IV. Leakage Rate Measurement of Glass G1A10  
Another important characteristic of these sealing glass systems is the leakage rate 
as it is used to seal the gaps between SOFC components. It determines whether the 
SOFC is reliable or not for short or long-term applications. This subject includes two 
parts which are shown below: 
¾ Leakage test device designing 
¾ Leakage rate measurement  
4.1 Design of Leakage Test Device 
    The equipment is totally made by S420 stainless steel in the causes of good 
oxidization resistance and good coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) matching 
with 8YSZ, glass sealant and interconnect (Crofer 22APU). Fig. 4.1 shows the 
AutoCAD diagram of the device, and the assembly diagram is also shown in Fig. 4.2. 
 
 38
 
 
 
4.2 Leakage Rate Measurement 
   We have completed the leakage test of the G1A10 glass at the temperatures at 
25oC and 600oC. The leakage rate is calculated by the following equation [29]: 
 
)/(
)(
cmsccc
tCP
VPP
L
f
fi
Δ
−= ……………………(4.1) 
 
Where L is the leakage rate, Pi is the initial pressure, Pf is the final pressure, V is the 
volume of the gas reservoir, t is t△ he time elapsed as the pressure decreases from Pi 
to Pf, and C is the circumferential length of the sealant. 
 According to the latest literature review [30,31,32,33], most of leakage tests are 
operated below 0.2 bar for the sake of being closer to the operating pressure of a 
SOFC. 
4.2.1 Test Sample Preparation 
    The test samples included a piece of disk-shaped 8YSZ, a piece of Crofer 22 and

V. Conclusions 
Bi2O3-ZnO-SiO2-B2O3 glass system shows a good wetting on sintered YSZ plate. 
Bi2O3 diffused slightly into YSZ along the grain boundary at 650oC and the Bi-species 
did not apparently react with YSZ. Zn2SiO4 segregated at the interface next to YSZ to 
form a barrier layer and prevent Bi2O3 diffusion. The crystallization and Bi diffusion 
can enhance the bonding strength in joining to YSZ, but not to Kovar. Bi-oxide based 
glass reacted with Kovar seriously and caused a weak interface.  
A significant creeping behavior of B4 and P1 glass ceramics was observed, 
which might perform a self-healing of cracks. Viscosity of residual glass was 
calculated in the range of 105 Pa*s. B4-glass has several advantages such as good 
wetting behavior, easy formation, better creep behavior and suitable Tg as an SOFC 
sealant better than lead-glass system. The disadvantage of B4-glass is low CTE value 
which decreases with crystallization. A 10-30 wt% ZrO2-dopant could increase the 
CTE of glass-ceramic and prevent cracks formation. Table 4.1 summarizes the 
differences of P1 and B4 glasses. 
 The glass-ceramics sealants based on BaO-SiO2-B2O3 with Al2O3 addition have 
been developed to meet the requirements for planar solid-oxide fuel cells. The thermal 
properties of the G-series glasses and the wetting behavior revealed that the glass 
forming range and the fluidity of the glass were strongly influenced by the B2O3/SiO2 
ratio. Also the crystallization can be retarded by addition of Al2O3. For the concerns, 
G1A10 glass is the most probable sealant for planer SOFC operating at 650-800oC.  
Three main crystalline phases in G1 glass would precipitate along the interface 
of YSZ/amorphous glass matrix, including BaSiO3, monocelsian, and hexacelsian. 
Hexacelsian has a CTE value of about 8 ppm/K which is more compatible with YSZ 
than monocelsian, which has a CTE value of 2.7 ppm/K. Because of the plate-liked 
shape of the hexacelsian grains, its CTE value is not isotropic. Therefore, the change 
of preventing the formation of monocelsian phase and shortening the aspect ratio of 
hexacelsian grain are the important issues in future work.  
From the cross-sectional morphologies of the glass sealing with YSZ or Crofer 
22, there existed a crystalline layer at the interface. The interfacial phase may lead to a 
thermal expansion mismatch and induce thermal stresses. Not only fine cracks were 
formed along and inside the crystalline phase, but also a gap was formed between the 
parent glass and the reaction layer. This would degrade the long-term stability of the 
sealants. 
G1A10 glass is a kind of good sealant for SOFC, which is demonstrated having a 
acceptable leakage rate for the common SOFC which is operated at the over-pressure 
lower than 1.0 bar. But the higher the operating pressure is, the higher the efficiency 
of the SOFC will be.

Abstract 
        The investigation at Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen- 
Nurmberg focused on the sealing material selection, creep behavior, viscosity 
variation and the composition analysis. Treated samples with different heat 
treatment conditions, and discussing the variation of glass phase content to creep 
behavior. There are some problems in G1 serial glass which was reported. In this 
investigation also tried to adjust the composition to modify the system to reach 
suitable sealing properties for SOFC.

        There are two kinds of model to calculate the viscosity. One is just for high content 
glass material. It uses a circular disc of glass, which is sandwiched between two refectory 
ceramic plates. The change in distance between the plates when a force is applied. Viscosity of 
corresponding glass, η, are calculated from the measured strain rate according to the formula

where σ  is the applied stress. The unit of σ  is Pa. ⋅ε   is the minimum strain rate 
measured during creep tests and υ  is the Poisson’s ratio of glass bulk. The viscosity range 
in 104-108 Pa‧s can be measured by this parallel plate method [Rawson, 1980]. 
        In general, viscosity is affected by temperature. The temperature dependency of 
viscosity can be described and calculated by Arrhenius equation [Rawson, 1980]:

The degree of crystallization in the glass also affects the viscosity. It changes with the

4. Results and discussion 
The results of G1 system 
        Casting G1 glass is hard to get a pure glass (without crystallization). Fig. 4-(a) shows 
the microstructure of as-cast G1 glass. There are a large amount of crystals inside. This might 
be caused by a rapidly crystallization during glass casting. Fig. 4-(b) shows the lower 
magnification of as-cast G1 glass. The formation of cracks is due to low strength and is hard to 
made TMA sample. Both of conditions with annealing at 300oC and without, G1 glass still 
show a rapidly crystallization.  
        Fig. 5 shows the wetting behavior of G1-cast glass. The melting point of G1 glass is 
950oC, but there is no wetting behavior for the glass-ceramics. Casting method can’t form a 
pure glass for SOFC application. The residual glass in Fig. 4-(a) is less than 1.5% measured by 
Image-C program.  
        Sandwich sample of YSZ/G1/YSZ also have the same problem. Rapidly 
crystallization was observed in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. After holding at 650oC for 10 min (Fig. 6) and 
1 hr (Fig. 7), the state of crystallization have no significant change. The average size of these 
crystals is 21 μm, and the thickness of glass-ceramic layer is 100 μm.

casting method. But the DTA results show the Tg of this glass is higher than 650oC that is a 
rigid sealing glass. The measurement of others properties will finish in Taiwan. 
Creep behavior analysis of G1 and B4 glass 
        There is no significant shape change (Fig. 5) at 1000oC; we set the temperature at 
800oC for creep test. Fig. 11 shows the creep result of G1 as-cast glass with the heating rate of 
5oC/min. The first 180 min represents the thermal expansion of glass-ceramic and alumina 
spacer. From 180 min to 200 min was the sinter behavior of G1 glass-ceramic. The period of 
200 min to 280 min showed crystallization and let this glass-ceramics more stable. After 280 
min to the end, a creep with the rate 0.12 μm/hr was observed. Integrating the creep behavior 
with micro-structural results can conclude that G1 is not a suitable glass as a sealant. The 
characters of this glass are less residual glass phase, less creep behavior at 800oC, and rapidly 
crystallization. It needs to adjust the composition to overcome these problems. The viscosity 
can be estimate by eq. (1), and get the apparent viscosity of G1 glass-ceramic is 5.9x1012 Pas. 
 
Fig. 10. The wetting behavior of as-cast B4-glass at different temperature. There is starting to 
wet at 910oC and completely wet on YSZ at 990oC. 
        Fig. 12 show the morphologies of B4-glass heat-treatment at 650oC holding for 
different period. Fig. 13 shows the creep result of YSZ/B4/YSZ sample at 650oC with and 
without load with a heating rate of 10oC/min. The first 60 min is the thermal expansion of YSZ, 
glass and alumina spacer. There is a deformation at 60 min to 85 min with 8.5 kPa loading. The 
viscous flow of glass can explain this phenomenon. The crystallization also corresponds to the

        Fig. 14 shows the creep behavior of as-crystallized samples with 8.5 kPa loading. 
Because the samples have been pre-crystallized, there is no observable deformation. The creep 
rate was proportional to temperature. The viscosity can be estimate by eq. (1). The results of 
apparent viscosity list in Table 2.

samples. G1 as-cast glass has higher CTE value than YSZ. B4 as-cast glass has suitable CTE 
value but a long time heat-treatment (crystallization) will decrease it.

during the whole melting process. The average loss of B2O3 is near to 7 mol% in each glass. 
Discussion 
        After finished the glass casting, wetting behavior measurement, microstructure 
observation and creep behavior measurement, comparisons of these four glasses are listed in 
Table 5. B4-glass has several advantages, but the decrease of CTE is the fatal disadvantage. 
G1-10A has potential as a sealant but still need to lower down Tg.
