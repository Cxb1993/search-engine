Furthermore, one of the major concerns for the decision makers is that among developed 
strategies and technologies for pollution prevention, how to find out the priorities for action. 
Causal analysis largely influences the effectiveness of decision making and the productivity 
of actions (Lin and Wu, 2008). The uncertainly and vague environmental interactions as well 
as the complex relationship between cause and effect make the causal analysis difficult. The 
Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) was developed in the belief 
that pioneering and appropriate use of scientific research methods could improve 
understanding of the specific problematique, the cluster of intertwined problems, and 
contribute to identification of workable solutions by a hierarchical structure. The DEMATEL 
method has become very popular worldwide because it is especially pragmatic to visualize 
the structure of complicated causal relationships (Wu and Lee, 2007) and has been applied 
into many practice in recent years, such as software system design (Hori and Shimizu 1999), 
reprioritization of failure modes in a failure mode and effects analysis (Seyed-Hosseini and 
Safaei, 2006), marketing strategy (Chiu et al., 2006) and evaluating intertwined effects in 
e-learning programs (Tzeng et al., 2007). In addition, the fuzzy logic is employed to improve 
approach on uncertainly and vague subjective judgment for complex environmental 
interactions. The fuzzy set theory is necessary introduced to represent and handle vagueness 
in decision making. The linguistic term approach is essential for decision makers to express 
their assessment. The fuzzy DEMATEL method has been applied on developing global 
manager’s competencies (Wu and Lee, 2007) and R&D project selection (Lin and Wu, 2008). 
A policy evaluating model of pollution prevention to sustainable water environment based 
on fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (fuzzy DEMATEL) is proposed. 
The purpose of this paper is to establish a hierarchical structure for influences degreed of 
water quality variables and to find out the critical variables for quality evaluation. The 
DEMATEL method illustrates the interrelations among variables, finds the central variables 
to represent the effectiveness of parameters and avoids the “overfitting” for evaluation. In 
addition, an empirical study is demonstrated on how to apply this proposed research. By 
analyzing the monitoring data, the performance of water management is reviewed and the 
priority of strategies is evaluated.

average matrix A  through the formulas (1) and (2), in which all principal diagonal elements

of the direct effects of problems along the powers of the matrix D , e.g. 2D , 3D , …, D , 
and therefore guarantees convergent solutions to the matrix inversion similar to an absorbing 
Markov chain matrix. The full total-relation matrix T  can be acquired by using the formula

and indirect relations between variables.

continuous value rather than the binary logic 0 or 1. A linguistic variable is a variable whose 
values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language ( Hsieh et al., 2004; Wu and 
Lee, 2007; Lin and Wu, 2008). To tackle the ambiguous involved in the process of linguistic 
estimation, it is a benefit way to convert these linguistic terms into fuzzy numbers. Since 
Bellman and Zadeh described the decision making methods in fuzzy environments (Bellman 
and Zadeh, 1970), an increasing number of studies have dealt with uncertain fuzzy problems 
by applying fuzzy measure (Chiou and Tzeng, 2002; Liou et al., 2003; Hsieh et al., 2004; 
Chiou et al., 2005; Wu and Lee, 2007). 
Fuzzy numbers are fuzzy sebset of real numbers, representing the expansion of the 
confidence interval. In practice, linguistic values can be represented by fuzzy numbers and 
the triangular fuzzy number (TFN) is commonly recommended. For the detail of essential 
definition of fuzzy logic and the operational laws of two TFNs please refer to Hsieh et al. and 
Wu and Lee (Hsieh et al., 2004; Wu and Lee, 2007). Corresponding to the scale representing 
of DEMATEL, for dealing with the ambiguities of human assessment, the linguistic variable 
“influence” is used with five linguistic term(Wu and Lee, 2007) as {No, Very low, Low, High, 
Very high} that are expressed in positive triangular fuzzy number , , ( )ij ij ijl m u  as shown in 
Table1.   
Take kijE  to indicate the linguistic variables “influence” of evaluator k towards criterion i  
affects the criterion j , i.e., ( ,  ,  )k k k kij ij ij ijE LE ME UE . A group of managers and decision 
makers are involved to express their opinion for achieving a favorable result. The rational 
behind the group decision making is the age-old adage: “two heads are better than one”. The 
average assessed value based on integrate the fuzzy judgment value of m  evaluators can be 
found as follows.

The sign   denotes fuzzy multiplication, the sign   denotes fuzzy addition, kijA shows 
the average fuzzy number of the judgment of the decision-makers, which can be displayed by 
a triangular fuzzy number as ( ,  ,  )ij ij ij ijA LA MA UA . The end-point values ijLA , ijMA and

Framework for National Sustainable development illustrates that environmental planning, 
resource conservation and pollution prevention are key policy items essential to sustainable 
development (Tzeng et al., 2007). One of our concerns is that do the key policy items are 
suitable and good enough to achieve the target of the EPA in 2011.  
 
2. Apply the proposed method on water management 
To achieve the goal stated above, the four variables for water quality evaluation (DO, 
BOD5, SS, and NH3-N) are employed in the study. The four variables are the key features 
suggested in water management related studies by earlier researches as well (Ross, 1977; 
Nives, 1999; Nagel, 2001; Liou et al., 2003). Experts are consulted to present their opinions 
on direct influent relation of variables in a natural or artificial language and than convert 
these linguistic terms into fuzzy numbers. Figure 1 shows an example of direct influent 
relation graph on water quality variables. The fuzzy numbers of direct influent relations 
between employed water variables for all the respondents are integrated and defuzzificaed. 
The total-relation matrix is computed and the results are shown in Table 3. Finally, the direct 
and indirect influence structure for river quality variables is resulted. The influence degree of 
water variables in water quality assessment by fuzzy DEMATEL is obtained and shown in 
Table 4. The purpose of the fuzzy DEMATEL enquiry in this research is the analysis 
components structure of each element, the direction and intensity of direct and indirect 
relationships that flow between apparently well-defined components. From the causal 
diagram, the results show that two variables BOD5 and SS are crucial cause variables among 
the four employed variables on water quality assessment (see Fig. 1). 
 
3. Discussion 
In 1991, the proliferation rate of public underground sewerage systems in Taiwan was 
merely 3%, and after years of construction, the rate reached 10.87% in 2003. While more 
attention has been paid in recent years to urban point source pollution through the 
establishment of wastewater treatment plants, no considerable planning nor any serious 
measures have been taken to control urban non-point source pollution (Taebi and Droste, 
2004). The achievement of wastewater pollution reduction based on the amount of BOD5 
(tonnes per day) from 1997 to 2006 is summarized in Figure 2. In addition, the percentage of 
non-polluted by river-lengths is shown as well. Although the reduction rate of BOD5 is 
increased gradually from 1997 to 2006 but the percentage of none pollution degreed does not
