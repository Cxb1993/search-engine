Abstract 
A simple method for determination of chemical oxygen demand using 
microwave digestion in wastewater is proposed. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is a 
widely used parameter used to measure water quality, as well as to control the 
treatment process. It is one of the important index in water monitoring. This 
parameter is defined as the amount of oxygen required for, or equivalent to, the 
oxidation of all chemically oxidizable matter in water. The traditional method for 
COD determination consists of oxidizing the organic matter of the sample, is done by 
adding a known amount of oxidant, refluxing at high temperature on open containers 
and titrating the excess oxidant. However, the method require the time-consuming 
process of heating samples to achieve more complete oxidation. It also consume some 
expensive( Ag2SO4 ) and toxic( HgSO4 ) chemicals.  
Therefore the goal of this study is to develop continuous and rapid 
determination of COD by microware digestion. In this system, the absorbance of Cr3+ 
generated during sample oxidation is measured at 600 nm, Chemical oxygen demand 
can be obtained in just 23 second. The optimal experimental condition are: 0.5 mL 
0.141 M silver nitrate solution; 3 mL 0.55 % sulfuric acid solution; 0.75 mL 0.0417 M 
potassium dichromate solution and 2 mL sample.?? 
The calibration graph is linear in the range of 0~500 mg/L. The interference of 
Cl- can be removed up to 4700mg/L. The method has a good precision and accuracy 
for KHP solution , glucose solution and sodium oxalate solution. This results showed 
that the certified reference materials were in good agreement with the preparation 
value. For four industrial wastewater, the results obtained by using this method 
presented exhibit good agreement with those given by the standard method of COD 
determination, and the relative error is less than 10 %.
