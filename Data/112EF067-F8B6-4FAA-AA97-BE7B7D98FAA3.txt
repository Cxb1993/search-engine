equations. After the monotonicity relation between the solution and the residual of a
differential equation is established, numerical calculation puts forth a new method,
the ‘‘residual correction method,’’ to overcome traditional problems in solving math-
ematical programming under inequality constraint conditions. Its idea is first to use
spline approximation to discretize the differential equation, then to use iteration
technique of residual correction to transform the once complex inequality constraint
problem into a simple problem of equation iteration.
PROBLEM FORMULATION FOR LOWER AND UPPER SOLUTIONS
Considering the problem of boundary-layer natural convection when a
Newtonian fluid passes through a flat plate, the governing equations on a dimen-
sionless flow field and temperature field [6] can be denoted as
f 000 þ 3ff 00  2f 02 þ h ¼ 0 ð1Þ
h00 þ 3 Pr f h0 ¼ 0 ð2Þ
with boundary conditions
On plate surface:
f ¼ f 0 ¼ 0; h ¼ 1 as g ¼ 0 ð3Þ
Far away from the surface:
f 0 ¼ h ¼ 0 as g!1 ð4Þ
where f ðgÞ and hðgÞ are dimensionless flow field and temperature parameters on the
g coordinate, respectively, and Pr is Prandtl number, which is assumed to be 1 in this
article.
In order to obtain the upper and lower solutions of a differential equation, in
most cases one has to rely on the maximum principle of the differential equation to
establish the solution’s monotonic relation (if any) with a residual function (also

concept of maximum principle to once nonmonotonic equations or systems of equa-
tions. The first step is to use the concept of virtual time to rewrite Eqs. (1) and (2)
into the following new differential equations:

where function u is the first differential value of f, indicating that Eqs. (13) and (14)
are the order-reduced expressions of Eq. (1). Ds denotes the positive increment of
virtual time. Superscript^ denotes the given or obtained function value in previous
time, which may be required to be either greater than or equal to, or smaller than
or equal to, the exact solution of the function, respectively, when extracting an upper
or lower approximate value. In addition, f^
a
and
^
f are the given values in previous
time that now can be determined to be smaller than or equal to, and greater than
or equal to, the exact solution. k is a variable used to complement the monotonicity
of the differential equation. In most cases, no doubt, it is impossible to obtain an
exact solution that satisfies Eqs. (13)–(15), so the relation between the approximate
function and exact solution is assumed as follows:
f ¼ ~f  d~f ð16Þ

h ¼ ~h d~h ð18Þ
where ~f , ~u, and ~h are the approximate solutions of exact solutions u, f, and h, respect-
ively, and d refers to the difference between the exact solutions and approximate
solutions. Putting Eqs. (16)–(18) into Eqs. (13)–(15) to obtain new residual
expressions,

it can be known that the sum on the right of the equal signs of Eqs. (23) and (24) is
positive, indicating that the residual of the differential equation is greater than or
equal to zero. It can be concluded from the concept of maximum principle that
d~f , d~u, and d~h have lower solutions that are smaller than or equal to zero (as their
exact solutions are zero). Therefore, from Eqs. (9)–(12), we can know when expres-
sions (30)–(35) are satisfied, and the obtained approximate solutions ~u, ~f , and ~h are
lower approximate solutions of their exact solutions. Certainly, it can be easily

where the superscripts m and n are iteration time and virtual time index, respectively,
subscripts i ¼ 0; 1; 2; . . . ;Ni are serial number of discretized calculation grid points,
and Rmi are residual correction values on calculation grid points, which are used to
correct the residual values on calculation grid points and ensure the residual values
of the neighboring subinterval of i grid point (xi1  x  xiþ1) are all positive or
negative. The complete process for residual correction is as follows.
1. Assume the residual on each grid point R0i ¼ 0.
2. Use Eqs. (50)–(52) to obtain new values unþ1i , u
0nþ1
i , and u
00nþ1

3. Estimate Rmþ1i required for the next iteration according to the residual value of
the neighboring subinterval of grid point i (xi1  x  xiþ1). Its residual correc-
tion relations are as follows:
When extracting the lower approximate solution
Rmþ1i ¼ Rmi minRðxÞ xi1  x  xiþ1 ð53Þ

Rmþ1Ni ¼ RmNi max½RðxÞ;RbðbÞ xNi1  x  b ð58Þ
where RðxÞ is the residual function obtained by putting the function and its deri-
vatives obtained from the previous step into the differential equation.
4. Progress one m value and repeat steps 2 and 3 until Rmþ1i ¼ Rmi .
To actually use the above method to solve residual correction equations (53)–
(58), we must obtain the residuals of neighboring subregions RðxÞ. However, the
functions and derivatives obtained from traditional difference are only those on grid
points. They are not continuous on noncalculation grid points, so they are not appli-
cable to this method. For this reason, this article adopts the concept of spline

In this way, the coefficients of functions and its first and second derivatives in Eqs.
(60), (61), (64), and (65) can be determined by the solutions obtained in previous vir-
tual time. For the method to obtain solutions, refer to Wang and Kahawita [7]. The
whole procedure to obtain solutions and correct residuals is as follows.
1. Set initial conditions: Set n ¼ m ¼ 0, set initial value according to Eqs. (62) and

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows the distribution curves of the residuals obtained by putting
upper and lower approximate solutions of dimensionless velocity and temperature
258 C.-C. WANG
into differential equations (20) and (21) before and after residual correction. There
are 11 calculation grid points that are evenly collocated on the plate surface between
ðg ¼ 0Þ and g ¼ 10 (i.e., the space of grid points is 1). It can be seen from Figure 1
that although the uncorrected residuals of the differential equation of the approxi-
mate solutions are always zero on calculation grid points (g ¼ 0, 1, 2,. . ., 10), they
are greater than or equal to zero on noncalculation grid points, as the approximate
solutions fail to satisfy all the inner regions within neighboring subintervals. After
residual correction, it is found that the residuals on calculation points are not always
zero. They are corrected by the residuals in neighboring regions to ensure that the
residuals in neighboring regions are all positive or all negative. For example, when
calculating upper solutions, the residuals at g ¼ 1 in Figures 1a and 1b are corrected
to about 0.01 and 0.04, respectively, making the residuals in the neighboring
regions 0 < g < 2 all smaller than or equal to zero. Noticeably, these two correction
values coincidently make the residual at about g ¼ 0:5 zero, indicating that these
two correction values are the optimal correction values that satisfy the condition that
the residuals in neighboring regions are all smaller than zero. On the other hand,
when calculating lower approximate solutions, the residuals at g ¼ 1 in Figures 1a
and 1b are corrected to 0.1 and 0.7, respectively, making the residual at about
g ¼ 0:8 zero and in neighboring regions all greater than zero.
Figure 2 illustrates the difference of approximate solutions and their first and
second derivatives of velocity and temperature before and after residual correction.
As the approximate curves are of cubic splines, both velocity and temperature curves
as well as their first and second derivatives are continuous, and only the second deri-
vatives show linear distribution in each subinterval (which means that the third deri-
vatives are not continuous on grid points). In any case, as second order is the highest
order in the differential equations (19)–(21), it is assured that the residuals of the dif-
ferential equations are continuous. That is the exact reason why this article gives up
traditional difference and adopts spline approximation. From Figure 2, we can easily
see the impact of residual correction on functions and their derivatives. When resi-
duals are corrected to be greater than or equal to zero, the approximate solutions
are smaller than those in the curve before residual correction. On the other hand,
when residuals are corrected to be smaller than or equal to zero, the approximate
solutions are greater than the approximate solutions before residual correction.
However, the monotonicity of solutions with residuals only exists in the function
itself and cannot be guaranteed in its first and second derivatives.
Since the residual distribution in Figure 1 indicates that the residual correction
method put forth by this article can correctly satisfy expressions (30)–(35) or (36)–
(41), it can be guaranteed that the curves of approximate solutions of various grid
points after residual correction as shown in Figure 3 have the following relations
with exact solutions: The top three curves in Figure 3 are for upper approximate
solutions of exact solutions, while the three curves below them are for lower approxi-
mate solutions of exact solutions. In other words, the curves of upper and lower
approximate solutions clearly limit the exact solutions in a region between them,
and the region shrinks with the increase of grid points as shown in Figure 4. That
means that the error of solutions tends to be reduced with an increase of grid points.
As the ultimate purpose of this problem is mostly for research on fluid shear
stress and thermal conductivity on walls, in order to more accurately study how

possible error obtained from Eq. (72), as expected, is reduced with increase of grid
points. For instance, when the number of grid points is 200, it is confirmed that
0:56729637  h0ð0Þ  0:56701472 ð74Þ
This result indicates that it is guaranteed the maximum possible error is smaller
than 0.04964%. In comparison with Relation [6] with an error of 5%,

we can see that these two are rather close. Notably, the maximum possible error here
refers to the possible maximum error between the exact solution and any approxi-
mate value within the range between the upper approximate solution and the lower
approximate solution. In practical applications, the mean approximate solutions
extracted from Eq. (71) can be used as the final and better numerical approximate
solutions, in this way, the error can be remarkably improved. In this example,
although exact solution cannot be determined exactly, as long as we put the lower
and upper approximate solutions in Tables 1 and 2 into Eq. (73), the error obtained
is certainly greater than the real error.
In order to validate the error range of the mean approximate solution in this
article, we put the upper and lower approximate solutions with 200 grid points into
terms g
a
and g of Eq. (73) and put mean approximate solution obtained with different
numbers of grid points into term g of the same equation. It is found that the
maximum errors of the mean approximate solutions in the last columns of Tables
1 and 2 are much smaller than the largest possible error. For instance, when there
are only 10 grid points, the errors of differential mean values of velocity and tem-
perature are already smaller than 1.5% and 0.4%, respectively. That indicates the
upper and lower solutions obtained by using the residual correction method in this
article can be used to analyze the maximum possible error of solutions. Moreover, as
the residuals of these two approximate solutions are always distributed on two sides
of zero in a basically symmetric manner as shown in Figure 1, the errors between the
upper=lower approximate solutions extracted from Figure 3 and the exact solution
are symmetric to considerable degree, and the values of mean approximate solutions
extracted from Eq. (73) are rather close to their exact solutions even there are only a

concluded that the numerical values obtained through this method and their diﬀerential values below the ﬁfth-
order are both continuous and very accurate. Recently, Wazwaz [8] and Syam and Atili [9] made attempts to
solve these problems through the Adomain decomposition method together with a modiﬁed technique, and
after having compared this approach with other numerical methods, came to the conclusion that such numer-
ical method can raise computational eﬃciency eﬀectively.
When we look back to the researches conducted in the past, we may ﬁnd out that most of the numerical
methods, when used to solve higher-order boundary-value problems, always base validation of the error range
of calculation results on the known exact solutions of these problems. In practical applications, however, the
exact solutions are often unknown to us. Under such circumstances, more grid points or approximation func-
tions are requisite to determine reliability of these results and their error range roughly, which requires a lot of
time and energy from us. In light of the above-mentioned situations, this paper suggests a new method ‘‘sixth-
degree B-spline residual correction method’’ to calculate maximum and minimum approximate solutions of
ﬁfth-order boundary-value problems for diﬀerential equations. The steps are as follows: ﬁrst establish the
residual expressions of a diﬀerential equation based on the maximum principle for diﬀerential equations; then
discretize and convert the residual relation into optimized constraint problems for inequations through sixth-
degree B-spline; and ﬁnally adopt the iterative technique for residual correction and the concept of virtual time
(if necessary) to translate originally complex inequational constraint problems into simple problems involving
equational iteration. The solutions obtained in such a way cannot only be deﬁned as the upper or lower solu-
tions of the exact solution, but also the value of error between the exact solution and the upper or lower solu-
tion can be considered as the maximum possible error of these approximate solutions.
2. Problem formulation for lower and upper solutions
2.1. Residual correction method
Let us begin by considering a nonlinear ﬁfth-order boundary-value problem as shown below:
uðvÞðxÞ ¼ Hðx; uÞ; x 2 ða; bÞ: ð1Þ
The traditional way to solve such a diﬀerential equation was no more than discretization of the equation into
an algebraic equation set or use of a trial function as its approximate solution. Yet such approximation meth-
od often fails to satisfy the diﬀerential equation completely on all calculation intervals. As a result, the residual
values of the diﬀerential equation occur. In order to obtain the maximum and minimum approximate solu-

where R(x) is a residual value function obtained from putting the function and its derivative value obtained
in the previous step into Expression (2).
4. Turn to the next value of m and repeat Steps 2 and 3, till Rmþ1i ¼ Rmi .
2.2. The sixth-degree B-spline
The residual values in the adjacent subdomains must be sought ﬁrst before the solutions of the residual cor-
rection expressions (6) and (7) may be obtained. However, the conventional ﬁnite diﬀerence method is more
often used to solve diﬀerential equations of lower order, and the functions derived through such method and
their derivatives only reﬂect the results at grid points and are not continuous at non-calculation grid points. To
address such issue, this article considers the sixth-degree B-spline as an approximation function to discretize
and convert Expression (2) into Expression (5), so as to ensure that the function itself and its derivative values
below the ﬁfth-order are not only continuous at grid points, but also continuous in any place. According to the
theory on B-spline, the relation of sth-degree B-spline may be expressed as follows [13]:

For the above-mentioned expression, s and d denote the greatest diﬀerentiable degrees and diﬀerentiation time
of the B-spline. Taking the sixth-degree B-spline into account, this expression can be rewritten into the follow-
ing form:

Apparently, the derivatives of Expression (9) below the ﬁfth-order are continuous in the x-aisle. So if the space
on [a,b] consisting of grid points X : a = x0 < x1 <    < xn = b is a uniform interval h = xi  xi1, the approx-
imation function of the diﬀerential equation can be expressed by many diﬀerent spline B6(x), enabling us to
suppose such approximation function takes the following form:

where the unknown coeﬃcient ci is a reference value for the spline at the grid point i. After substitution of
Expression (9) into Expression (10), we can get discrete relations below the ﬁfth-order at grid points as follows:

2. Let m = 0 and suppose that the quantity for residual correction Rmi ¼ 0.
3. Turn to the next value of m, determine the unknown coeﬃcient ci by using Expressions (24) and (25), and
then obtain the approximate solution u(x)m+1 and its derivatives below the ﬁfth-order based on Eqs. (9) and
(10).
4. Derive a new residual correction quantity Rmþ1i from Expression (6) or (7).
5. Repeat Steps 3 or 4, till Rmþ1i ¼ Rmi .
To make sure if the residual correction method really enables the constraint conditions of Expression (20)
or (22) to be met, Fig. 1 shows curve distributions of residual values of the diﬀerential equation on the x-axis
before and after residual correction is carried out. As shown in this ﬁgure, for the approximate solutions which
do not experience residual correction, although the residual values of the diﬀerential equation are equal to zero
at calculation grid points (x = 0,0.1,0.2, . . . , 1), the phenomena in which the residual values are not equal to
zero at non-calculation grid points do occur, because the approximate solution cannot satisfy all internal areas
on adjacent subintervals, leading to occurrence of the phenomena that the residual values are equal to zero at
non-calculation grid points. Through further observations, we can ﬁnd out that the residual values that do not
experience residual correction are distributed in such a way that meets the requirement for the residual values
to be smaller than or equal to zero in all areas, indicating that no residual correction is needed to obtain the
lower approximate solution. As a result, the two distribution curves of residual values overlap in the ﬁgure. On
the other hand, the residual values of Eq. (19) must satisfy the distribution of residual values for Expression
(22) (i.e. greater than or equal to zero). For this purpose, a residual value is added to each calculation grid
point in the process of residual correction to ensure that all residual values of the diﬀerential equation are
greater than or equal to zero on subintervals, as shown in the ﬁgure.
Since the residual values in Fig. 1 satisfy Expression (20) or (22), the following relationship between the
approximate solution listed in Table 1 and the exact solution can be ensured, even if the exact solution cannot
be sought: the approximate solution u
_
is the optimal upper approximate solution of the exact solution, while u
^
serves as the optimal lower approximate solution of the exact solution. In another word, residual correction
will result in such feature of the approximate solution: the upper approximate solution must be greater than
the lower approximate solution, and the exact solution must exist between the upper and lower approximate
solutions. Such feature provides the basis for determining the range of the maximum possible error of both

and lower approximate solutions obtained following the residual correction in relation to the exact solution is
also characterized by such symmetry to some extent, thus improving the accuracy of the mean approximate
solution indirectly. Secondly, the results from comparison between the solutions obtained in this paper and
those sought by Caglar et al. [7] under the condition of the same number of grid points show that the method
suggested by this article is not only useful in determining the maximum possible error, but also the accuracy of
the mean approximate solution is improved signiﬁcantly.

uðvÞðxÞ ¼ 24e5uðxÞ þ 48ð1þ xÞ5 ; 0 < x < 1; ð26Þ
uð0Þ ¼ 0; u0ð0Þ ¼ 1; u00ð0Þ ¼ 1; uð1Þ ¼ lnð2Þ; u0ð1Þ ¼ 1=2: ð27Þ

equation as follows:

We take the calculation steps as done in Example 1 and adopt the homotopy perturbation method [14] to han-
dle recursive solutions of nonlinear terms, and then we will see the residual values are distributed above or
below zero after residual correction is performed, as shown in Fig. 3, and the upper and lower approximate
solutions obtained are listed as in Table 3. In addition, the maximum error of approximate solutions is ana-
lyzed and the values of actual error are calculated under the conditions of diﬀerent number of grid points, with
the results shown in Fig. 4 and Table 4, respectively. In general, the relationship between approximate and
exact solutions and the number of grid points is similar to that in example, indicating that the residual cor-
rection method proposed in this article can also be applicable to solving nonlinear ﬁfth-order boundary-value
problems eﬀectively.

cannot be ensured based on the maximum principle for diﬀerential equation. However, after residual correc-
tion proposed in this article, the resulting residual values at calculation grid points, as shown in Fig. 5a and b,
are not necessarily equal to zero, instead, correction shall be carried out on residual values according to their
adjacent subintervals to ensure that every residual value is a positive or negative number on adjacent subin-
tervals of the grid point. To further conﬁrm the existence of monotonicity, Tables 5 and 6 show wall diﬀer-
ential values and error analysis of functions u and G. We can ﬁnd out from Tables that the lower
diﬀerential approximate values at wall (g = 0) of functions u and G always remain less than the corresponding
upper wall diﬀerential values. This is because the wall boundary conditions are ﬁxed (i.e. G(0) = u(0) = 0), so
the diﬀerential approximate values at wall also show the monotonicity properties similar to the inherent
monotonicity properties of the functions. Such monotonicity properties ensure the value of diﬀerence between

Abstract
This article presents two new test methods to decide monotonic increasing or decreasing properties of diﬀerential equa-
tions. For simple problems, the eigenfunction test method can be applied to obtain their exact monotonicity or their loosest
conditional expression, and can contribute to probes into accumulated eﬀect of various terms in equations on their mono-
tonicity. Secondly, the trial function test method sets relatively strict conditions for discrimination ofmonotonicity, but it can
verify complex non-linear problems in a simple and rapid way. Therefore, these two similar test methods will help to further
understand theories on monotonicity, thus making it possible to apply monotonic equations more widely to other problems.

1. Introduction
Regarding error analysis of approximate solutions of diﬀerential equations, early in 1964, Appl and Hung
[1] began to utilize the maximum principle [3–5] to judge monotonicity of such boundary value problems and
on this basis, to obtain upper and lower approximate solutions of exact solutions of diﬀerential equations in
order to understand error range of these approximate solutions. Again in 1966, Finlayson and Scriven [2]
made the similar attempts. However, such method requires conversion into mathematical programming prob-
lems of inequalities, resulting in very complex and lengthy process of operation. In light of this, to the author’s
knowledge, some scholars have recently tried to use given trial functions in combination with genetic algo-
rithms (Lin and Chen [6] and Chang and Lee [7]) instead of traditional non-linear programming methods
to get better approximate solutions. Besides, Wang [8,9] used Spline as the basic function to discretize diﬀer-
ential equations, followed by addition of residual correction values to discretized grid points, using the ‘‘resid-
ual correction method” he proposed, to convert complex constraint mathematical programming problems of
inequalities into simpler equational iteration ones. As a result, the eﬃciency of obtaining solutions is raised
signiﬁcantly.

Among eﬀorts on monotonicity analysis in the past, monotonicity of second order boundary values were
most thoroughly discussed. To describe monotonicity of such problems, let us consider the following diﬀeren-

where 0 6 h 6 p/2 and 0 6 / 6 p/2, and one of them is not equal to zero at any time. Suppose that u_ðxÞ and

this problem has the properties of monotonic decreasing [3].
As indicated above, Expression (13) is applied to judge existence of monotonicity in monotonicity analysis
of second order boundary value problems. Simple as this method is, it is often too strict in practice. Besides the
possibility that originally monotonic problems are decided as non-monotonic by using such method, it is not
applicable to solve high order boundary value problems. For this reason, this article presents two new discrim-
ination methods in an attempt to judge monotonicity more accurately.
2.2. The eigenfunction test method
Let us consider the boundary value problem involved in Expressions (1) and (2), if its corresponding
eigenfunctions
LðuÞ ¼ ku; 2 V ; ð14Þ
BðuÞ ¼ 0; 2 S ð15Þ
exist and have n eigenvalues {ki} (i = 1,2,3, . . . ,n), and their corresponding linearly independent eigenfunc-
tions are {ui} (i = 1,2,3, . . . ,n), the complete set of such eigenfunctions can be regarded as a group of the bases
for expression of function u(x) included in Eqs. (1) and (2), i.e.
uðxÞ ¼
Xn
i¼1
uiðxÞ: ð16Þ
So when
dRi
dui
P 0; i ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; n ð17Þ
it can be concluded that monotonicity of Expressions (1) and (2) exists and is characterized by monotonic
increasing that can satisfy Expressions (5)–(7). Conversely, when
dRi
dui
6 0; i ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . ; n ð18Þ
the monotonicity of Expressions (1) and (2) still exists and is characterized by monotonic decreasing that can
satisfy Expressions (7)–(9).
2.3. The approximate function test method
Similarly, consider the boundary value problem covered by Expressions (1) and (2), which leads to the
residual equation that can be denoted as
Rð~uÞ ¼ Lð~uÞ  f ðxÞ ¼ Lðd~uÞ; 2 V ð19Þ

the contribution of various terms to monotonic quantity in this expression will always be negative values and
satisfy Expression (17) if iP 1. This indicates that Example 1 has the properties of monotonic decreasing if the
above-mentioned expression is satisﬁed.
The eigenfunction test method can be applied to obtain the simplest and correct expression for monotonic-
ity analysis; however, sometimes diﬀerential equations are so complex that their eigenfunctions cannot be
sought easily. In such cases, the test method of trial functions may be useful for monotonicity analysis of these
diﬀerential equations. As in Example 1, suppose the approximate solution that meets the boundary condition
of Expression (26) is ~u(x) and the diﬀerence between this solution and the exact solution u is d ~u = ~u  u. Put
this solution and the expression of the diﬀerence into Expression (25) and rewrite it into a residual relation, as
what is done to Expression (19), i.e.
Rð~uÞ ¼ ~u00ðxÞ þ k2~uðxÞ MðxÞ ¼ d~u00ðxÞ þ k2d~uðxÞ; x 2 ð0; lÞ ð33Þ
then the monotonicity of this problem can be determined through use of function d~uðxÞ. Since the highest or-
der diﬀerential term of this problem is of monotonic decreasing, let trial functions u
_
and u
^
be polynomials that
satisfy Expression (21) and (22), respectively,
d u
_ðxÞ ¼ xðl xÞ
Xn
i¼1
aixi; ð34Þ
d u
^ðxÞ ¼ xðl xÞ
Xn
i¼1
aixi; ð35Þ
the problem can be recognized as monotonic, if Expression (24) is satisﬁed, too. Here, let us begin by consid-
ering the simplest form, i.e. let n = 0 and put Expressions (34) and (35) into Expression (33), then the necessary
condition for existence of monotonic decreasing is
ð2þ k2xðl xÞÞP 0P 2þ k2xðl xÞ; x 2 ð0; lÞ: ð36Þ
Similarly, based on Expression (32) derived by using the eigenfunction test method, the condition for
Expression (36) at x 2 (0, l) is
k2 6 8
l2
: ð37Þ
So the approximate function test method can lead us to conclude that this example is monotonic, provided
that Expression (37) is satisﬁed. It should be noted that the condition for monotonicity analysis of the expres-
sion indicated above is much stricter than that in Expression (32). The greater the value of n in Expression (34)
and (35) is, the more chances there will be to ﬁnd more proper trail functions, thus making the generated dis-
criminant closer to the correct one obtained with the eigenfunction test method.
In order to demonstrate the applicability of monotonicity test methods proposed in this text, the upper and
lower approximate solutions obtained with the methods suggested in [7,8] are required to meet the conditions
that residual value distribution of diﬀerential equations are always smaller or greater than zero at l = 1 and
M(x) = 1, as shown in Fig. 1. And Fig. 2 shows the error of upper and lower approximate solutions varies
as k2 increases. As indicated in Fig. 2a, because k < p, the upper and lower approximate solutions of the dif-
ferential equation obtained under monotonic decreasing are always distributed at both ends of the exact solu-
tion respectively and expectedly. However, when k continues to increase till it is greater than p, the upper and
lower solutions obtained ﬁrst at k2 = 20 are not really greater or smaller than the exact solution, but on the
contrary, as shown in Fig. 1b. When k2 further increases to be at 60, it is clear that the upper and lower
approximate solutions are distributed irregularly in upper and lower sides of the exact solution, showing that
when the diﬀerential equation is not monotonic any more, it is impossible to determine the relation of approx-
imate solutions with the exact solution, or in another word, it is impossible to judge whether the approximate
solutions are larger or smaller than the exact solution.

the value of Expression (44) will be always negative regardless of the value of i, indicating that Example 2 is
monotonic if Expression (45) is satisﬁed. In this example, since r and k are unknown, it will be diﬃcult to gen-
erate a simple discriminant by using the trial function test method. For this reason, the following example is
given to demonstrate the advantages of trial function test method.
Example 3. Let us begin with the following problem
u00ðxÞ þ 5xu0ðxÞ þ 10uðxÞ ¼ 1; x 2 ð0; 1Þ; ð46Þ
uð0Þ ¼ uð1Þ ¼ 0 ð47Þ
this example can be considered as a non-monotonic problem if its ﬁrst order diﬀerential term is not taken into
account. Yet, since ﬁrst order diﬀerential terms can have impact on monotonicity as Example 2 indicates, it is
still likely that monotonicity of this problem exists. For conﬁrmation, the trial function test method is applied
to ﬁrst generate the residual relation of Expression (46) as follows:
Fig. 2. Distribution of error between approximate function and exact solution when (a) monotonicity exists (b) monotonicity does not
exist for Example 1.

the value of the above expression will be always greater than zero in the domain of x at a = 0.3. So with the
boundary conditions in Expression (54), Expression (50) is monotonic increasing.
To further verify correctness of monotonicity test, Tables 2 and 3 show the numerical solutions obtained
under two diﬀerent boundary conditions as the value of k becomes smaller. As shown in Table 2, when k
is greater than p4, the diﬀerential equation in this example is monotonic, so if its residual values are greater
than or equal to zero, or smaller than or equal to zero, the approximate solutions will be the upper and lower
approximate solutions respectively. However, if the value of k is smaller than p4, the diﬀerential equation is
not monotonic any more, and the approximate solutions obtained under such conditions are not monotonic,
either. So we are not certain that the approximate solutions obtained under R(x)P 0 are still the upper solu-
tions. Similarly, it is not certain that the approximate solutions obtained under the condition of R(x) 6 0 are
the lower solutions any more. In addition, Table 3 shows the same results, except that its monotonicity exists
when k < 500.56 under diﬀerent boundary conditions.

Here, e and c are positive constants that represent the elasticity parameter and a boundary stress, respectively.
For such physical problems, the traditional approach of monotonicity analysis is no longer applicable in
deciding whether monotonicity of equations exists. So the approximate function test method suggested in

of time and space terms, and, generally speaking, can improve the error in time terms
effectively. Adopting the perturbation method, Aziz and Enamul [3] and Caldwell
and Kwan [4] considered the parameters for nonlinear terms in an equation as per-
turbation terms and unfolded them. This method is effective in solving nonlinear
problems, as these authors discussed and verified. Eslinger and Chung [5] and Pham
[6] employed the finite-element method to solve heat transfer problems with complex
geometric shapes. Recently, some scholars have also used hybrid differential
transformation methods [7] and Taylor transformation methods [8] to analyze heat
transfer of thermal fins, and found out that less calculation time is required in com-
parison with other methods. Additionally, there are methods of a kind which rely on
symbolic calculations to get series solutions of approximate solutions, such as Ado-
mian’s decomposition method [9, 10], the variational interation method [11, 12], and
the Frobenius series solution method [13]. The solutions gained with such methods
and their derivatives of certain orders are continuous and, in addition, these methods
can lead to fast series convergence. Other methods, including those by Galerkin
[14, 15] and Runge-Kutta [16], are also employed to solve heat transfer problems
of various types.
The literature review shows that different methods have different features, such
as fast convergence, high accuracy, applicability to complex geometric shapes,
efficiency in obtaining transient solutions, ease in solving nonlinear equations, etc.
However, few of them are devoted to error analysis of approximate solutions.
Usually, among the research on finding solutions, only a very few simple or
special boundary-value problems can be solved with exact solutions obtained; for
many other problems, only the approximation method is applied to approach their
approximate solutions. Although past research has shown that the error between
approximate solutions and exact ones tends to decrease as the number of calculation
grid points or approximate functions increases, this method requires relatively more
memory space and computational time, and most important, remains ineffective in
fully determining the accuracy of approximate solutions. In light of this, another
theory based on maximum principles in differential equations (Protten [17] and
Ladde et al. [18]) is utilized to determine the error range between approximate

when the relation holds true as
R~hðx; yÞ  Rhðx; yÞ ¼ 0  R~hðx; yÞ in D and on qV ð4Þ
the following relation between approximate solutions and exact solutions will
accordingly also be established (Protten [17] and Ladde et al. [18]):
~hðx; yÞ  hðx; yÞ  ~hðx; yÞ ð5Þ
In inequality (5), approximate solutions ~hðx; yÞ and ~hðx; yÞ are referred to as the
lower and upper approximate solutions of the exact solution hðx; yÞ, respectively,
and differential equations with such a relation are said to be of monotonicity.
The main purpose of this article is to decide whether maximum principles for
differential equations are applicable to the finite-difference method. According to
these principles, the preconditions for solving the residual relation R~hðx; yÞ are that
~hðx; yÞ and ~hðx; yÞ must have definitions and continuous derivatives up to second
order on the domain D. In view of this, research in the past focused on a combi-
nation of continuous functions (Chang and Lee [19]) as a trial function, or on a
‘‘continuous and smooth’’ B-spline function (Wang [20]) to discretize the approxi-
mate equation. Such an approach is adopted not only because it meets the require-
ments of maximum principles for differential equations, but also because it facilitates
obtaining the residual value at any point within the domain D to ensure that the
approximate functions meet the relation given in expression (4) within the domain
D. However, the functions and their derivatives gained with the finite-difference
method only reflect the results at grid points and do not have continuity. Thus, it
is necessary to ascertain first whether this method is applicable to maximum princi-
ples of differential equations.
To apply the finite-difference method, intervals of an approximate function
will be first divided into several subintervals, followed by approximation to deriva-
tive values at endpoints of each subinterval based on the finite concept. Though it
features a simple form and facilitating equation formulation, the method leads to
the question that the function or its derivatives are not continuous in boundaries
between adjacent subintervals. Taking one-dimensional space as an example, if the
approximate function on a discretized subinterval x 2 ðxi1; xiþ1Þ takes the form
hiðxÞ  hi þ h0iðx xiÞ þ h00i
ðx xiÞ2
2
x 2 ðxi1; xiþ1Þ ð6Þ
where the subscript i stands for the serial number of discretized grid points, hiðxÞ for
the approximate function on this subinterval, and hi; h
0
i, and h
0
i for the functional
value and its one-order and two-order differential values at the grid point i, respec-
tively. If the values of the above equation at hiðxiþ1Þ and hiðxi1Þ are equal to those
of hi1 and hiþ1 at adjacent grid points, respectively, when the intervals between
adjacent grid points are all equal to Dx, the well-known central finite-difference
expression can be derived, namely:

the differential equation and its boundaries will be generated as follows:
R~hðxÞ ¼ ~h00ðxÞ  ~h0ðxÞ  ~hðxÞ ¼ dh00ðxÞ  dh0ðxÞ  dhðxÞ 6¼ 0 ð12Þ
Rbðx ¼ aÞ ¼ c1  ~h0 ¼ dhðaÞ ¼ 0 ð13Þ
Rbðx ¼ bÞ ¼ c2  ~h3 ¼ dhðbÞ ð14Þ
Figure 2 shows schematically the distribution of the residual value dhðxÞ in
boundaries and calculation intervals. Based on this figure, as the finite-difference
method meets boundary conditions at x ¼ a and x ¼ b, the residual values on
boundaries can be set to zero, as in Eqs. (13) and (14). On the other hand, since
the approximate function ~hðxÞ cannot be satisfied on the domain of the differential
equation, i.e., not all residual values are equal to zero, it is assumed in this article
that the value ~h1 at grid point x1 is smaller than the exact solution (i.e., dh1 < 0),
while the value ~h2 at grid point x2 is larger than the exact solution (i.e., dh2 > 0),
as shown in Figure 2. To understand the relation between the approximate function
and the exact solution, at first we assume that ~hðxÞ is a function very much smaller
than the exact solution. Based on maximum principles, the residual equation of
expression (12) must satisfy the condition for the following relation:
R~hðxÞ ¼ ~h
00ðxÞ  ~h0ðxÞ  ~hðxÞ ¼ dh00ðxÞ  dh0ðxÞ  dhðxÞ > 0 x 2 ða; bÞ ð15Þ
From Figure 2, it can be observed that whether the maximum value occurs at
the grid point x ¼ x2 or in its vicinity, the approximate function derived with the
finite-difference method always has a curve which is continuous until second order
and passes through the grid point. For example, in the case that the maximum value
happens to occur at the grid point x2 (situations at nongrid points are similar to this),

then an optimal objective function (approximate solution) can be found,
hðx; yÞ ¼Max½~hðx; yÞ ð18Þ
to ensure that the approximate function ~hðx; yÞ is the optimal approximate solution
equal to or smaller than the exact solution. Conversely, when the residual value of
~hðx; yÞ meets the constraint conditions
R~hðx; yÞ  0 in D ð19Þ
R~hðx; yÞ  0 on qV ð20Þ
then an optimal objective function,
~hðx; yÞ ¼Min½~hðx; yÞ ð21Þ
can also be found accordingly to ensure that ~hðx; yÞ is equal to or larger than the
exact solution. Though upper and lower approximate solutions are useful in accu-
racy or reliability analysis of a solution, it is often complex and difficult to seek opti-
mal solutions from mathematical programming problems under these constraint
conditions. For this reason, such theory has been explored theoretically without
being applied in solving complex problems in the long run. In light of this situation,
this article proposes a residual correction method of finite-difference to simplify ine-
quational mathematical programming problems into equational iteration problems
that resemble differential equations in obtaining solutions traditionally. The concept
is to discretize the original equation into an inequality by using the iteration tech-
nique and then convert the inequality into the equational expression as follows:

where the superscript m stands for iteration times, the subscripts i and j for the serial
number of calculation grid points following discretization, and Rmi;j for the residual

produce convective heat transfer effect. The dimensionless energy equilibrium
equation is formulated as (Aziz and Enamul [3], Chiu and Chen [10])
ð1þ ehÞh00 þ eh02 N2h ¼ 0 0  x  1 ð30Þ
with the boundary conditions
h0ð0Þ ¼ 0 hð1Þ ¼ 1 ð31Þ
where e and N indicate the parameters of dimensionless thermal conductivity and
surface convection of longitudinal fins. When N¼ 0, it means the fin surfaces are
in a state of heat insulation with no convective effect; similarly, when e ¼ 0, it means
its thermal conductivity coefficient is a constant value and does not vary with
the temperature, which will be used to simplify the original equation into a linear
heat transfer equation. In addition to focusing on linear equations, this article will
also touch on the influence of nonlinear effect on the error of solutions within the
ranges 0:6  e  0:6 and 1  N  2.
Verification of Monotonicity and Residual Relation
It is necessary to decide whether Eq. (30) is monotonic before seeking its
approximate solutions. With expression (3), we can get
q
qh
½ð1þ ehÞh00 þ eh02 N2h ¼ e~h00 N2 ð32Þ
This formulation indicates that the monotonicity of this problem becomes weaker as
eh00 increases, and that when eh00 is larger than N2, the equation is no longer mono-
tonic, thus making it impossible to confirm that the approximate solution gained in
this case is the lower or upper value of the exact solution. For this example, we will
describe in detail how to strengthen the monotonicity of the equation and to induce
the existence of monotonicity. First, the monotone iterative method (Ladde et al.
[18]) is applied to add kðh h^Þ to both sides of the equation to enhance its mono-
tonicity, where h^ is a known function smaller or larger than the exact solution, while
k is a positive number. Since the finite-difference method can fully satisfy boundary
conditions, it is unnecessary to consider residual values in boundaries at both ends,
and only the internal residual equation is required to be considered. For the sake of
monotonicity analysis, assume that the error between the approximate function ~hðxÞ
and the exact solution hðxÞ is dhðxÞ, with the relation between them as being
hðxÞ ¼ ~hðxÞ  dhðxÞ ð33Þ
Put expression (33) into expression (30) with smaller items neglected, and an internal
residual relation can be generated as
RðxÞ ¼ kð~h h^Þ þ ð1þ e~hÞ~h00 þ e~h02 N2~h
¼ ð1þ e~hÞ dh00 þ 2e~h0 dh0  ðN2 þ k e~h00Þ dh kð~h h^Þ

2. First, discretize expression (34) at each calculation grid point and reformulate it
into an equation as follows:

hi ¼ 1 when i ¼ Ni ð44Þ
where Rmi is the residual correction value at the calculation grid point i used to
correct residual values at calculation grid points to ensure that every residual
value is a positive or negative value on the adjacent subintervals
(xi1  x  xiþ1) of the grid point.
3. Let m¼ 0 and suppose that the quantity for residual correction Rmi ¼ 0.
4. Solve the algebraic equation set consisting of expressions (42)–(44) to get the
approximate solution hmþ1i at each grid point, and obtain derivatives h
0mþ1
i and
h00mþ1i at grid points using central difference expressions (7) and (8).
5. Establish the approximate function at each grid point with the approximate
solutions obtained in step 4, taking the following form:
hmþ1i ðxÞ ¼ hmþ1i þ h0mþ1i ðx xiÞ þ h00mþ1i
ðx xiÞ2
2
x 2 ðxi1; xiþ1Þ ð45Þ
Substitute the above expression into residual expression (34) to get residual value
RðxÞ, and derive a new residual correction quantity from expressions (25) and
(26).
6. Turn to the next value of m, and repeat steps 4 and 5 until either expression (36)
or (39) is satisfied.
7. Let h^i ¼ hmþ1i , repeat steps 2–6, and continue until ðhi  h^iÞ=hi
 <105 is met.
Numerical Test Results and Discussion
Figure 4 shows the distribution of residual values obtained with the traditional
finite-difference method but without residual correction. In this figure, residual values
RðxÞ indicate the results of approximate function hiðxÞ defined by expression (6),
which are obtained through substituting the function into the residual relation (34).
According to this figure, all residuals at grid points are equal to zero, and some resi-
duals are not equal to zero any more in a place far from these points. This is because
traditional finite-difference methods satisfy differential equations only at grid points.
Thus, residual values at nongrid points are randomly larger or smaller than zero. Now
that the results fail to meet the requirements of expression (36) or (39), it is certain
that the approximate solutions obtained with traditional methods cannot be used

therefore is helpful to improve the numerical accuracy, and its actual error is usually
far less than the maximum possible error.

The heat flux varies with the change of value of length–width ratio c as shown in
Figure 10. In this figure, the heat flux gradually approaches a constant value as
the value of length–width ratio c increases, indicating that the temperature variation
along the y axis may be overlooked since it is far less than that along the x axis. And
this originally two-dimensional problem can accordingly be simplified into a one-
dimensional problem. Furthermore, the error analysis indicates that when the num-
ber of grid points is fixed, the error range of heat flux gradually enlarges with
increase of the length–width ratio c, meaning that larger c values are not favorable
to the error analysis and that the number of grid points will be increased to ensure
the accuracy of solutions. However, regardless of the error value, the method
proposed in this article can always be used to outline correctly the area where the
analytic solutions may exist and to determine the error bounds of approximate solu-
tions. This indicates that the method proposed in this article has good applicability.
Example 3. Consider a circular fin with a sysmetric rectangular profile. If the
circular fin produces convective and radiative heat transfer effect on its surface, its

in the time domain. In addition, Rizzo and Shippy [5] applied the Laplace transform
for the first time to convert time terms into simple algebraic functions in 1970, and
then used the BIEM and inverse Laplace transform to obtain transient numerical
solutions. Such a method features separate calculations of time and space terms,
and in general, is useful in improving the error in time terms effectively. From then
on, some scholars tried to integrate other numerical methods, including the finite-
difference method (Chen and Chen [6]) and the Taylor transformation method
(Yu and Chen [7]), to solve transient heat conduction problems. In addition to the
methods mentioned above, there are another symbolic operation methods, e.g.,
Adomian’s decomposition method [8, 9], which rely on symbolic operations to derive
the series solutions of approximate solutions. Methods of this kind are characterized
by existence of solutions and continuity of derivatives of many orders, in addition to
rapid convergence of series.
The preceding literature review shows that various methods for solving transi-
ent heat conduction problems provide many contributions to analysis of these pro-
blems, such as the features of rapid convergence, high accuracy, applicability to
complex geometric shapes, effectiveness in handling transient solutions, convenience
for processing nonlinear problems, etc. Yet these methods seldom touch on the error
relationship between the approximate solutions and the exact solution obtained with
these methods. Though in general the error between approximate solutions and the
exact solution will decrease with an increasing number of calculation grid points,
these methods require more computer memory and calculation time, and, most
important, are still unable to determine accuracy of approximate solutions com-
pletely. In light of this, another theory, which is based on the maximum principle
for differential equations (Protter [10] and Ladde et al. [11]), is explored to find
upper and lower approximate solutions of the exact solution. According to this prin-
ciple, any continuously differentiable function that satisfies the inequality f 00ðxÞ> 0
on an interval must reach the maximum value of the function f ðxÞ at one endpoint of
the interval. More generally, if a function satisfies a differentiable inequality on a
domain and reaches its maximum value on the domain boundary, we can say that
this differentiable equation satisfies the maximum principle and has monotonicity.
However, this method will lead to rather complex and lengthy calculations in the
solving process, because it requires finding the optimal solutions of an inequality
with constraint conditions (Finlayson and Scriven [12]). Over recent years, there
have been extremely few discussions of such kinds of theories, except for Chen
and Lee [13], who applied genetic algorithms, and Wang [14,15], who applied the
B-spline in combination with the residual correction method, to explore the possi-
bility of solving these problems in simpler ways. And as for the widely applied
finite-difference method, it requires the solution intervals to be divided into many
subintervals, followed by adoption of the difference concept to approximate deriva-
tive values at either endpoint of each subinterval, which makes it feature simple
forms and easy formulation. However, this method is generally considered as inap-
plicable to the maximum principle, as it is also accompanied by the problem of dis-
continuity of functions or their derivative values at the juncture of subintervals. As a
result, no discussion has thus far been focused on application of the finite-difference
method in combination with the maximum principle to seek upper and lower
approximate solutions of differential equations. In light of this, attempts will be

simply, the residual of the approximate function eT on the domain D of the
differential equation.
Suppose that the function Tðt; x; yÞ is the exact solution enabling the residuals
of Eqs. (3)–(5) to be zero, and that the approximate functions bTðt; x; yÞ and Tðt; x; yÞ
have definitions on the domain D and have continuous derivatives of second and
first order in relation to space and time terms. Then, as long as the following
traditional discriminant is satisfied (Protten [10] and Ladde et al. [11]),

 0 in D ð6Þ
we can conclude for sure that when
RTðt; x; yÞ  0  RbTðt; x; yÞ in D and on qV ð7Þ
holds true, the following relationship between the approximate solutions and the
exact solution will also hold:
Tðt; x; yÞ  Tðt; x; yÞ  bTðt; x; yÞ ð8Þ
For the above-mentioned relation, the approximate solutions Tðt; x; yÞ andbTðt; x; yÞ are known as the lower and upper approximate solutions of the exact sol-
ution Tðt; x; yÞ, respectively, and we may say that differential equations with such
relationship have monotonicity.
In addition to the basic descriptions given above, for more information on the
techniques of increasing monotonicity or looser discrimination methods for monoto-
nicity that have been proposed over recent years, refer to Wang [14, 16].
Although the maximum principle for differential equations can be adopted to
build a common monotonic relation like expression (8), two difficult issues still exist
when this principle is applied practically; one is that approximate functions must be
supplemented with the characteristics of continuity and differentiability, and the
other is how to quickly find the solutions that satisfy inequalities with constraint
conditions, as shown in expression (7). Discussions of these aspects are be given in
the next two sections.
2. Analysis of Characteristics of the Finite-Difference Method
To meet the requirements that approximate functions should be continuous and
differentiable in the space or time domain, past research focused on combining several
continuous functions (Chen and Lee [13]) as a trial function or use of a ‘‘continuous
and smooth’’ B-spline function to discretize an approximate equation (Wang [14]).
Such methods are adopted not only because they can meet the requirement for the
maximum principle of differential equations, but also because they make it easy to
get residual values in any space or time in the domain D to ensure that the approxi-
mate function can satisfy the residual relation of expression (7) in the domain D com-
pletely. When the finite-difference method is applied to discretize differential
equations and attempts are made to ensure that the obtained approximate solutions
satisfy the relation in expression (7), however, the function and its derivative obtained
with this method only represent the results at grid points and do not have the

satisfied in the domain of the differential equation, meaning that all residuals
ReTðt;xÞ of the differential equation are not equal to zero, its residual values at an
instant will be shown schematically as in Figure 1. According to this figure, because
the approximate curve developed from expression (12) can satisfy the values at the
neighboring grid points, there must be at least two approximate functions on every
interval. On the other hand, in order to ascertain whether the finite-difference
method applies to the maximum principle for differential equations, we first suppose
that eTðt;xÞ is a function which is fully smaller than the exact solution [i.e.,
dTðt;xÞ 0], thus, according to the maximum principle for differential equations,
the residual relation of expression (9) is required to satisfy
ReTðt;xÞ¼eTtþ eTxx eTx eTþ f ðt;xÞ¼dTtþdTxxdTxdT  0 ð13Þ
It can be seen from Figure 1, however, that if the maximum value happens to occur
at xi (the same as in the cases where the maximum value does not occur at any grid
point), even if the approximate functions dTr;i1ðt;xÞ and dTr;iþ1ðt;xÞ developed
from expression (12) can satisfy expression (13) at this point, yet because dTr;iðt;xÞ
has the following features at the point of the maximum value, i.e.,
dTðt;xÞ> 0
dTxðt;xÞ¼ 0
dTxxðt;xÞ 0
dTtðt;xÞ 0
8><>: ð14Þ
it is clear that substitution of the above expression into expression (13) will not make
expression (13) be satisfied. Thus it can be concluded that the curve close to this grid
point does not constitute lower approximate solutions of the exact solution. In light
of this, the residual at this point must be corrected, as shown in Figure 2, so as to
make it possible for all approximate curves to satisfy the requirement for expression
(13) and to further ensure that the approximate solutions obtained are functions
smaller than the exact solution. Similarly, it can also be concluded that when all
approximate curves on the intervals of grip points enable expression (9) to satisfy

3. Residual Correction Procedure
Though upper and lower approximate solutions of the exact solution, once
obtained, will be useful in analyzing solution accuracy or reliability, this kind of
mathematical programming problem, for which optimal solutions are sought under
constraint conditions, often constitutes a rather complex and difficult process. As a
result, theories of this kind have long been explored theoretically but not applied
practically to solve complex problems. In light of this, to follow up on the study con-
ducted by Wang [14, 15] on the procedure for correcting space and time terms, this
article proposes procedures for finite-difference residual correction for transient heat
problems, with a view to simplify mathematical programming problems originally
involving inequalities into the sort of equational iteration problems in which solu-
tions to differential equations are sought in a traditional way. The concept is to dis-
cretize the original equation by using the iteration technique and then rewrite the
inequality into an equational relation as follows:
Rmr;i;j ¼ F ðeTÞmþ1r;i;j ; ðeTtÞmþ1r;i;j ; ðeTxÞmþ1r;i;j ; ðeTyÞmþ1r;i;j ; ðeTxxÞmþ1r;i;j ; ðeTyyÞmþ1r;i;j  fr;i;j in D
ð15Þ
For the above expression, Rmr;i;j and the superscript m represent the residual correc-
tion values and times of correction iteration at calculation grid points, respectively,
which are used to correct residual values at calculation grid points to ensure that
residual values on each adjacent subinterval are positive or negative values. The
whole process of residual correction is as follows.
1. Let the iteration time m¼ 0, and assume that the residual correction value at each
grid point Rmr;i;j ¼ 0.
2. Use Eq. (15) with initial and boundary conditions to get the values of new Tmþ1r;i;j
at grid points and its derivatives within two orders, and develop approximate
curves at each grid point according to expression (12) and Table 1.
3. Substitute the approximate function at each grid point into the residual relation
to calculate the residual value Rðt; x; yÞ on adjacent subintervals [t 2 ðtr1; trÞ;
x 2 ðxi1; xiþ1Þ; and y 2 ðyj1; yjþ1Þ] of each grid point ðr; i; jÞ as a basis to
estimate the residual value Rmþ1r;i;j required for the next iteration. The residual
correction value is estimated as follows:
a. For lower approximate solutions,
Rmþ1r;i;j ¼ Rmr;i;j min Rðt; x; yÞ ð16Þ
b. For upper approximate solutions,
Rmþ1r;i;j ¼ Rmr;i;j max Rðt; x; yÞ ð17Þ
4. Advance to the next m value and repeat steps 2 and 3, until all residual values on
the intervals are smaller or larger than zero.

Analytical solutions exist as follows:
Tðt; xÞ ¼ 1þ 2x
x2 þ xþ 6tþ 1 ð25Þ
Since Eq. (22) can satisfy expression (6) in deciding monotonicity, the upper and
lower approximate solutions of the exact solution obtained with the method proposed
in this article are distributed as in Figures 4 and 5. As shown clearly in these figures, the
upper and lower approximate solutions are always on upper or lower side of the exact
solution, outlining the existing range of the exact solution, no matter what the distance
between grid points of time and space is. In fact, the range size virtually reflects the
errors between approximate solutions and the exact one. So the errors of the approxi-
mate solutions increase with time and reach the maximum value approximately at
t ¼ 0:25, and the errors of the approximate solutions in relation to time terms decrease
gradually as the temperature field gradually enters into a stable state, as shown in the
figures. Therefore, the overall error also decreases gradually until the values of error in
relation to space terms. In order to further verify the correctness of the method pro-
posed in this article and observe how the error range changes with grid points, the
initial temperature for expression (23) is reset to be at 1 to carry out analysis of the
errors of the upper and lower approximate solutions obtained under the condition
of different distances between grid points, as shown in Table 2. Pursuant to Table 2,
it is clear that the upper and lower approximate solutions gradually approximate to
a certain value and always satisfy the requirement for monotonicity of expression
(8), though there is no way to identify the value of the exact solution. In another words,
in general, it is always feasible to work out the maximum possible error between the
mean approximate solution T and the exact solution at any grid point based on the
Figure 4. Distribution curve of upper and lower approximate solutions in relation to the exact solution
in Example 1.

and the error obtained by such means is the error between the mean approximate
solution and the exact solution under the most unfavorable condition. In general, how-
ever, the errors between the upper and lower approximate solutions and the exact
solution occur in a considerably symmetrical way, so the actual error is far smaller
than the results derived from expression (26).
Example 2. Let us consider a one-dimensional annular heat sink. Suppose
that the boundaries at both ends of the heat sink are subject to periodic temperature
change and heat insulation, the thermal conductivity coefficient of the heat
sink changes with the temperature in the manner of a linear function, and the heat
convection effect occurs on the surface of the heat sink. Then the dimensionless
energy balance equation for this problem can be formulated as follows (Chiu and
Chen [8]):
Tt þ ð1þ eTÞTrr þ eT2r þ
1
r
ð1þ eTÞTr N2T ¼ 0 ð28Þ
subject to the initial and boundary conditions
Tð0; rÞ ¼ 1 ð29Þ
Tðt; 1Þ ¼ 1þ s sinðBtÞ Trðt; 2Þ ¼ 0 ð30Þ
where s and B refer to the dimensionless temperature change amplitude and fre-
quency parameter, respectively, while e and N stand for the dimensionless heat con-
duction parameter and convection parameter of the heat sink, respectively. When the
parameter N ¼ 0, the surface of the heat sink is under the condition of heat insu-
lation, indicating that there is no heat convection effect on the surface; similarly,
when the parameter e ¼ 0, the heat conductivity coefficient of the heat sink is a fixed
value, indicating that this physical quantity does not change with the temperature
and allows the heat conduction problem to be reduced to a linear heat conduction
equation. In this example, the parameters are set as follows: s ¼ 0:1, B ¼ 1,
N ¼ 1, and e ¼ 0:2.
Instead of focusing on periodic heat analysis, this example is intended to clarify
the distribution characteristics of errors of the approximate solutions found on the
maximum principle for differential equations. Therefore, the upper and lower
approximate solutions obtained through residual correction are shown as in
Figures 6 and 7, which show clearly that the upper approximate solutions are always
distributed on the upper side of the lower approximate solutions in the whole calcu-
lation area. The space left between the upper and lower approximate solutions repre-
sents the range where the exact solution may exist, and the maximum possible errors
between mean approximate solutions and the exact solution can be understood
through expression (26) and distributed as shown in Figure 8. Thus, a comprehensive
review of distribution features as shown in Figures 6–8 will lead to the conclusion
that the maximum possible error between approximate solutions and the exact
solution occurs at the rear end of the heat sink. Second, it is interesting to see that

Similar to the processes in which the one-dimensional heat conduction problem is

For this expression, the transient two-dimensional upper and lower approximate
solutions sought through the residual correction method proposed in this article
are as shown in Figures 9 and 10.
According to Figure 9, it is very clear that the upper and lower approximate
solutions satisfying expression (7) highlight the range where the exact solution
may exist, as expected, and Figure 10 further shows that the upper and lower
approximate solutions are distributed as expected on the upper and lower sides of
Figure 8. Maximum possible error between the mean approximate solution and the exact solution in the

at e ¼ 0 Similarly, when e ¼ 0:03; we can still conclude that the exact solution of this
nonlinear transient heat conduction problem must occur within the area surrounded
by the upper and lower approximate solutions, as shown in Figure 10, based on the
method proposed in this article, even though we are unable to know this exact
solution. In addition, because the boundary temperature in this problem declines
rapidly to 0F at the beginning of heat conduction, the maximum possible error is
considerably large for this problem at the very beginning and becomes gradually
smaller as heat conduction enters into a stable state, as shown in Figure 10. No mat-
ter how large the error is, however, it can be further seen from Figure 10 that mean
values of the upper and lower approximate solutions remain considerably close to
the value of the exact solution. Therefore, the method proposed in this article is
not only useful in roughing out the range where analytical solutions may exist and
the scale of errors, the mean values of their upper and lower approximate solutions
can also be considered as a solution that is closer to the exact solution.

and u and u′ shall be continuous at x = c or d . Functions f and g are continuous on the intervals
[a, b] and [c, d], while the parameters α, β and r are real finite constants. Such kind of mathemat-
ical models are commonly seen in many disciplines, including elasticity, transportation, structural
analysis, economics and optimization and so on, and are usually known as obstacle, unilateral,
contact, moving, free boundary value or equilibrium problems [4,6,7,9,14]. A review of studies
on such problems shows that many scholars have made their attempts to apply such methods
or techniques such as the Rayleigh–Ritz method [16], finite difference [12], cubic spline [2,11],
quadratic spline [1], quartic spline [3] and non-polynomial spline [15] to probe into accuracy and
convergence of solutions of these problems with success. However, none of the aforesaid methods
are effective in analysing the error range of approximate solutions simply, easily and clearly. For
this reason, the paper will rely on the maximum principle of differential equations, and further
apply the innovative ‘residual correction method’ to obtain the upper and lower approximate
solutions of these differential equations and analyse the error range of these.
Although the maximum principle of differential equations [8,13] has long been utilized to
estimate the error range of approximate solutions of differential equations, the complicated calcu-
lation and procedures lead to prevent this method from being applied to complex problems, since
the discrete expressions of differential equations have to be converted into inequalities’mathemat-
ical programming problems under constraint conditions in the process of solving these equations.
To the author’s knowledge, as for the recent studies in this regard, only Lin and Chen [10] and
Chang and Lee [5] attempted to employ the approach of genetic algorithms to solve these math-
ematical programming problems. This paper will present a new calculation method similar to
the concept of Wang [17] – ‘Asymptotic Iteration Residual Correction Method’ – to obtain upper
and lower approximate solutions of these special problems. For this purpose, the following steps
shall be fulfilled: first, apply the technique of asymptotic iteration to strengthen monotonicity of
these nonlinear differential equations, so as to make these problems satisfy the conditions of the
maximum principle of differential equations; second, use the spline approximation technique to
discretize these differential equations; and third, transform the once complex inequational con-
straint problems into simple problems of equational iteration based on the concept of residual
correction. By doing so, the inequational mathematical programming problems under constraint
conditions can be solved very quickly.
Problem formulation for lower and upper solutions
The maximum principle
Usually, in order to obtain upper and lower solutions of differential equations, it is necessary to
establish the monotonic relation of residual functions of these equations (also known as residual)
with their solutions based on the concept of the maximum principle of differential equations
(if such monotonic relation exists). Therefore, there is the need to illustrate the content of the
maximum principle before introduction of the residual correction method proposed in this text.
To begin with the description of the maximum principle of second-order boundary value problems,
let us consider a nonlinear boundary value problem as follows:
R(x, u) = u′′ + H(x, u, u′), x ∈ (a, b) (3)
with the boundary conditions
R(x = a, u) = u′(a) cos θ − u(a) sin θ + γa, (4)
R(x = b, u) = u′(b) cosφ − u(a) sin φ + γb, (5)

terms in Equation (14) are necessarily greater than or equal to zero on x ∈ (a, b) so as to ensure
that the sum of terms of Equation (14) in the right side of the equality sign is a positive value.
The reason for such requirements lies in: if the sum of terms of Equation (14) in the right side of
the equality sign is greater than or equal to zero, it implies that δu˜ is smaller than or equal to the
required value ‘zero’ (i.e. δu˜ = 0); and it can be seen from Equation (12) that only the negative
δu˜ can make the obtained approximate solution u˜ smaller than or equal to the exact solution u.
Similarly, this process is also applicable in obtaining the upper approximate solutions. Therefore,
the induction of all constraint conditions shows that in addition to the monotonicity (required by
Equation (6)), which should be satisfied in the course of obtaining solutions, the following must
also be satisfied in order to obtain the lower approximate solution:
R(x, u˜) = u˜′′ + H(x, u˜, u˜′) − λ2(u˜ − uˆ) ≥ 0, x ∈ (a, b), (15)
λ2(u − uˆ) ≥ 0, x ∈ (a, b), (16)
R(x = a) = α − u˜(a) ≥ 0, (17)
R(x = b) = β − u˜(b) ≥ 0. (18)
In this way, we may find an approximate solution 	u = max(u˜), and ensure 	u ≤ u and the approx-
imate solution is the optimal lower solution. Similarly, in order to obtain the upper approximate
solution, besides Equation (6), the following shall also be satisfied:
R(x, u˜) = u˜′′ + H(x, u˜, u˜′) − λ2(u˜ − uˆ) ≤ 0, x ∈ (a, b), (19)
λ2(u − uˆ) ≤ 0, x ∈ (a, b), (20)
Rb(x = a) = α − u˜(a) ≤ 0, (21)
Rb(x = b) = β − u˜(b) ≤ 0. (22)
Again in this way, an approximate solution u = min(u˜) can also be discovered, and we can ensure
that u ≥ u and u = min(u˜) is the optimal upper approximate solution.
The cubic spline
Inequalities (15)–(22) must be satisfied both on x ∈ (a, b) and on the boundary line. But the
functions and their derivatives obtained traditionally with the definite difference method are only
the results on grid points, and are not continuous on non-calculation grid points. In light of this,
the cubic spline is adopted in this paper as an approximate function to disrectize Equation (15) so
as to ensure that the function itself and its derivative values within second orders are continuous
not only on grid points, but also at any point. So if the interval between grid points {V : x0 < x1 <
· · · < xN } is considered as an unequal interval hi = xi − xi−1, based on the theory of the cubic
spline, the linear discrete general formula of one-dimensional second-order differential equations
is as follows:
ui = Fi + Gimi + SiMi, (23)
where F , G and S are constants. To find the solutions of thus expression, the functional relation
of the cubic spline can be applied to translate Equation (23) into an algebraic equation that only
includes ui and the first-order derivative mi or the second-order Mi . For example, the expression

αNu(xN) + βNu′(xN) = γN, (33)
where α0, β0 and γ0 as well as αN , βN and γN are all constants.
Based on the theory of the cubic spline, Equation (32) can be discretized and rewritten into
B0M0 + C0M0 = D0 (34)
subject to the conditions
B0 = 3G0G1h1α0 − 2G0h21α0 − 6G1S0α0 + 6h1S0α0 + 3G1h1β0 − 2h21β0 − 6S0β0, (35)

DN = 6 (FN (GN−1αN + hNαN + βN) − FN−1 (GNαN + βN) + γN (GN − GN−1 − hN))
(41)
Residual correction method
Although the upper and lower approximate solutions obtained with the aforesaid method can con-
tribute to accuracy or credibility analysis of the exact solution, yet Equations (15)–(22) represent
mathematical programming problems of optimal solutions to be obtained under constraint con-
ditions, of which the process is very complex and difficult. As a result, the cubic spline method
has long been confined to theoretical studies, but could not be applied to solve complex prob-
lems. In order to understand the effect of residual correction values added to grid points on
residual values within adjacent subintervals, we may consider a simple equation for the test
purpose, i.e.
u′′(x) − u′(x) − u(x) = 0, (42)
u(0) = u(1) = 0. (43)
First, the concept of the cubic spline is accepted as the basis for discretion of the equation as
indicated before, and then the calculation interval is divided into 10 uniform grid points; and finally
the residual correction quantity whose value is 1 is added at x = 0.2, 0.6 and 0.7. Following the
calculation, its effect on residual values of the differential equation and solutions of the function in

continuous. Based on these results, the complete process of residual correction can be outlined
as follows:
1. Establish the residual relation
R(x) = u˜′′ −
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
f (x) a ≤ x < c
g(x)u˜ + f (x) + r c < x < d
f (x) d < x ≤ b,
(44)
R(0) = α − u˜(a), (45)
R(1) = β − u˜(b). (46)
At x = c and d, because the differential value on the left side of these points is not always
equal to that on the right side, naturally the residual values on left and right sides of these
points are different. Accordingly, for the calculation of residual values at c or d, the residual
correction shall be carried out in the following.
For obtaining lower approximate solutions:
R(x) = min(R(x+), R(x−)) (47)
For obtaining upper approximate solutions:
R(x) = max(R(x+), R(x−)), (48)
where x+ means x ≥ c or x ≥ d , while x+ means x ≥ c or x ≥ d.
2. Discretize and rewrite the previous inequality into an equational iteration relation that includes
correction quantity based on the cubic spline concept
Rmi = u˜′′m+1i −
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
f (x) a ≤ x < c
g(x)u˜m+1i + f (x) + r c < x < d
f (x) d < x ≤ b,
(49)
where the superscript m refers to times of iteration for residual correction, while the subscript
i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N stands for the serial number of discretized calculation of grid points. Rmi
represents the residual correction quantity on the calculation of grid points and serves to correct
the residual values on the calculation of grid points to ensure that all these values are positive
or negative on the adjacent subintervals of grid points (xi−1 ≤ x ≤ xi+1).
3. Let m = 1 and suppose the residual on each grid point Rmi = 0.
4. Apply Equation (49) to obtain a new um+1i and its differential values below second orders.
5. Use the residual value on adjacent subintervals of the grid point i to estimate the correction
quantity required for next iteration Rm+1i . Its residual correction relation is as follows: For
obtaining lower approximate solutions:
Rm+1i = Rmi − max R(x). (50)
For obtaining upper approximate solutions:
Rm+1i = Rmi − min R(x), (51)
where the function R(x) is the residual value obtained in an adjacent subinterval by putting
the value of the function resulting from the last step and the function’s derivative value into
Equation (44).
6. Proceed to the next step with a new value of m and repeat steps 4 and 5 until Rm+1i = Rmi .

Based on the maximum principle of second-order differential equations, it is clear that when the
approximate function u˜ = 	u satisfies the constraint conditions
R(
	
u) ≥ 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ π (59)
and the objective function is
max(
	
u) (60)
the minimum value 	u(x) of the optimal approximate solutions can be found. Similarly, when the
approximate function u˜ = u satisfies the constraint conditions
R(

u) ≤ 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ π (61)
and the objective function is
min(u) (62)
the maximum approximate solution u(x) can also be obtained. Therefore, in order to solve
the inequational mathematical programming problems of Equations (59)–(62), steps 3–6 in the
previous section can be applicable to obtain upper and lower approximate solutions.
To make sure if the results obtained with the residual correction method are correct, the residual
distribution before and after residual correction are mapped in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively.
As shown in Figure 2a, for the approximate solutions before residual correction, the residual
values of their differential equation are distributed in the following way: (i) on the intervals
x < π/4 or x > 3π/4, the approximate function satisfies the differential equation completely; so,
all residual values are equal to zero on these intervals; (ii) in the neighbourhood of discontinuous
points x = π/4 and 3π/4, because the approximate function cannot satisfy discontinuity of the
differential equation at these points, the residual values fluctuate obviously at these points; (iii)
on the intervals of x > π/4 and x < 3π/4, because the approximate function still cannot satisfy
the differential equation completely, distribution of smaller residual values can be seen on the
adjacent subintervals between the grid points; (iv) however, since the approximate function can
satisfy the differential equation on discrete grid points, the residual values on the calculation of
grid points are always equal to zero. In addition, Figure 2b shows the distribution curve of the
residual values, which originate from those as shown in Figure 2a but have been processed with
residual correction, regardless of the original distribution of these residual values. As can be seen
in this figure, the residual values of Equation (57) will satisfy Equation (59) in order to obtain
lower approximate solutions. Given this reason, new values have been added to some calculation
of grid points (e.g. x = 2π/10 and 3π/10) in the process of residual correction to ensure the
residual values on the adjacent subintervals of these grid points are greater than or equal to zero,
as shown in Figure 2a. Similarly, at the time of obtaining upper approximate solutions, it is clear
that after residual correction on the grid points, the corrected residual values are smaller than zero,
thus satisfying the requirements that the residual values on their adjacent subintervals must be
smaller than or equal to zero. So it can be concluded from Figures 1a and 1b that, irrespective of the
residual values distributed before the residual correction, the residual correction method proposed
in this text can always be effective in correcting them to the residual values that are smaller or
greater than zero as required. The convergence of iterative correction is shown in Table 1. This table
indicates that the residual values after first correction have been very close to the requirements, so
totally three times of corrections are needed to obtain upper approximate solutions, while only two
times of corrections are needed to obtain lower approximate solutions. This means the correction
method presented in this article cannot only be applied to convert complex inequality constraint

both sides of the exact solution as the number of grid points increases. Accordingly, it can be
concluded that the exact solution will always be confined to this range even under the condition
of unknown exact solution. Further, it can also be concluded that the maximum possible error
between approximate solutions and the exact solution Ep(x) at any point of x will be equal to half
of the difference between the upper and lower approximate solutions, as shown in Figure 4. To
confirm its correctness and the error range more strictly, Table 2 lists the lower solutions, mean
solutions, upper solutions and related error ranges at x = π/2 with different numbers of grid
points. As the table shows, the lower and upper approximate values always stand on both sides
of the exact solution and gradually approximate the exact solution as the number of grid points
increases. So the maximum possible error calculated on the basis of Equation (53) tends to reduce
expectedly as the number of grid points increases. It is worthy to note that the maximum possible
error here refers to the maximum error of approximate values lying within the range of upper and
lower approximate solutions compared with the exact solution. Among practical applications, the
mean approximate solutions calculated on the basis of Equation (52) can be considered as the

accuracy of the mean approximate solutions obtained in this text is found to be slightly higher
than that obtained in [2,11,12]. Thus, it can be expected that approximate functions of higher
accuracy, if applied, will generate better results.
Problem 2 Further consider the nonlinear problem originating from Equation (1) when

(64)
Apparently, this expression does not satisfy Equation (6), because it is possible that the values
of u′(x) in the x-axis are negative. This means that it is uncertain if monotonicity of residuals of
its differential equation in relation to its solutions does exist. To achieve increased monotonicity
of Equation (64), based on the previous descriptions of monotonicity, a monotonicity correction
parameter λ is introduced here to reformulate the expression into the following relation:
u′′ − u′u − 1 − λ2(u − uˆ) = −λ2(u − uˆ), (65)
where the residual relation of its approximate function is:
R(x) = u˜′′ − u˜′u˜ − 1 − λ2(u˜ − uˆ) = δu˜′′ − u˜δu˜′ − (u˜′ + λ2)δu − λ2(u − uˆ). (66)
So, if the value of λ2 satisfies
u′ + λ2 ≥ 0 (67)
in order to obtain its lower approximate solution, provided its approximate function u˜ = 	u further
satisfies the conditions of
R(x) = 	u′′ − 	u′	u − 1 − λ(	u − uˆ) ≥ 0, (68)
u − uˆ ≥ 0, (69)
the equation will be monotonic, and it can be ensured that the max(	u(x)) obtained is the
lower approximate solution of the exact solution. On the contrary, in order to obtain the upper
approximate solution, provided that its approximate solution u˜ = u satisfies the conditions
R(x) = u˜′′ − u˜′′u˜ − 1 − λ(u˜ − uˆ) ≤ 0, (70)
u − uˆ ≤ 0. (71)
Similarly, it can also be ensured that the min(u(x)) obtained is the upper approximate solution of
the exact solution.
The calculation steps similar to those for Problem 1 can be taken to correct the residual values
of this problem, resulting in the distribution of residual values as shown in Figure 5, where all
residuals are greater or smaller than zero. The upper and lower approximate solutions obtained
are indicated as in Figure 6. To find solutions, let λ2 = 2, and further let the initial value of uˆ be
equal to zero to meet the requirement that the initial value shall be smaller than or equal to the
exact solution for the purpose of obtaining the lower approximate solution, and take the value of u
calculated each time as a new value of uˆ for the next iteration. Such effort is meant to ensure that
uˆ can approximate the value of the exact solution under the condition of being smaller than the
exact solution at any time of the calculation. Similarly, in order to obtain the upper approximate

approximate solutions obtained with different numbers of grid points is identified as shown in the
last column of Table 4. The table shows that, as in Problem 1, the mean approximate solutions
are still considerably accurate even with the fewest grid points. This implies that the method is
also effective, since the upper and lower approximate solutions obtained from nonlinear obstacle
problems are still symmetrical as shown in Figure 5, thus indirectly improving the accuracy of
this mean approximate solution.
Conclusions
As proved by the two examples given in the previous section, the residual correction method
proposed in this paper can be applicable in properly correcting residual values of such differential
equations as obstacle, unilateral, moving, free boundary value or equilibrium problems, so as
to make these residual values satisfy the requirement that residuals must be greater or smaller
than zero. The two examples show that based on the concept of residual correction quantity on
grid points, such methods can be effective in converting the constraint problems of inequalities
into new problems of equational iteration. Therefore, additional memories are unnecessary and
times of iteration are quite few in the process of obtaining upper and lower approximate solutions.
Compared with the other traditional methods, under the condition of the same grid points, this
method requires more times of iteration in the process of computation. In addition, the introduction
of ‘asymptotic iteration’ technique can also contribute to increased monotonicity of nonlinear
differential equations, thus making the maximum principle of differential equations applicable to
a wider range of problems.

and features of their own, for instance, fast convergence, high accuracy, effectiveness in dealing with transient terms, eas-
iness in solving non-linear equations, etc. and contribute much to solution of this equation. However, according to researches
on the solution of this equation, exact or inﬁnite series solutions of the differential equation can be sought as a comparing
criterion for numerical methods only under simple or special initial or boundary-value conditions; in other complex cases, it
is necessary to approximate exact solutions of the equation by addition of grid points or approximate functions. Thus, while
past researches suggest that the errors between approximate solutions and exact ones usually tend to reduce as the number
of calculation grid points or approximate functions increases, this approach requires more memory space and computing
time for computers, and most importantly, it is still ineffective in determining the range of approximate solutions’ errors
completely. In light of this, this paper will follow up the researches by Wang [7,8] with extension of the maximum principle
for differential equations from one-dimensional applications to the Burgers’ equation that contains transient terms. Besides,
the widely-applied ﬁnite difference method is generally considered as inapplicable to the maximum principle, since the
derivatives of its approximate functions are not continuous at any point. As a result, no attempt has been made thus far
to combine this method with the principle for obtaining upper and lower approximate solutions of exact solutions. This
is the main reason why the maximum principle for differential equations has seldom been applied so far. Given this, in
its numerical method, this paper will, for the ﬁrst time, apply the simple but well-known ﬁnite difference method instead
of the B-Spline function that is highly accurate and continuous at all points to analyze the errors of approximate solutions of
the Burgers’ equation.
2. Problem formulation for lower and upper solutions
2.1. The maximum principle for parabolic partial differential equations
The maximum principle for differential equations is the extension of basic problems in calculus. It states that any contin-
uously differentiable function which satisﬁes the inequality f00(x) > 0 within an interval must reach its maximum value at an
interval end point. More generally, if a function satisﬁes a differential inequality in its domain and reaches its maximum va-
lue at the boundary of the domain, we say that the differential equation satisﬁes the maximum principle and has monoto-
nicity. To ﬁnd upper and lower approximate solutions of the Burgers’ equation, this paper must be based on the maximum
principle for differential equations at ﬁrst to establish the monotonic relation of its residual function with its solutions. Thus,
the maximum principle for parabolic differential equations may be expressed as follows:
R~uðt; xiÞ ¼ L½u  f ðt; xiÞ ¼ F t; xi;u; @
~u
@xi
;
@2~u
@xi@xj
 !
 @~u
@t
 f ðt; xiÞ; x; t 2 E ð4Þ
with initial and boundary conditions:
R~uð0; xiÞ ¼ pðxiÞ  uð0; xiÞ; xi 2 V ; ð5Þ
R~uðt; xi ¼ aiÞ ¼ qðt; xiÞ  uðt; xiÞ; xi 2 S \ T: ð6Þ
L in (4) is the differential operator of this parabolic differential equation. If V is a ﬁnite ﬁeld in n-dimensional space and the
function ~uðt; xiÞ is the solution of Eq. (1) in the domain E = V \ (0,T), the function R~u in expressions (4)–(6) is known as the
residual function of the differential equation in the domain E or around the boundary S, or abbreviated as residuals. Suppose
that the function u(t,xi) is the exact solution that makes all residuals of Eqs. (4)–(6) equal to zero, and that the approximate
functions u
_ðt; xiÞ and u
^ðt; xiÞ have deﬁnitions in the domain E and these functions as well as their derivatives of some orders
are continuous. If @F/@u exists in the domain E and satisﬁes the following discriminant:
@F
@u
6 0 in E ð7Þ
when
Ru^ðt; xiÞP Ruðt; xiÞ ¼ 0P Ru_ðt; xiÞ in E and on S ð8Þ
holds true, the following relation will hold true, too [9]:
u
^ðt; xiÞ 6 uðt; xiÞ 6 u
_ðt; xiÞ: ð9Þ
In the above expression, the approximate solutions u
_ðt; xiÞ and u
^ðt; xiÞ are known as the lower and upper approximate solu-
tions of the exact solution u(t,xi) respectively, and the differential equations with such relationship are called to be
monotonic.
In the aforesaid descriptions on the maximum principle for parabolic differential equations, it is particularly stressed that
the derivatives of the approximate function with respect to time and space must be continuous. Therefore, Wang [7,8] ap-
plies second-order polynomials and cubic B-splines to discretize time and space terms in his researches. In addition to satisfy
the conditions as indicated above, this approach also makes it easy to ﬁnd the residuals at any point in the domain E in order
to check if the approximate function can satisfy the residual relation given in expression (8) in the domain E. However, when

include both time and space differential terms, and the descriptions about the maximum principle for such equations have
indicated the relationship between time and space differential terms as in Eq. (1). So, the following steps shall be followed to
ﬁnd upper and lower approximate solutions of a differential equation by using the ﬁnite difference method:
1. Find out the monotonic residual relation of the problem in question.
2. Word out function values at each grid point in accordance with the traditional ﬁnite difference process.
3. Obtain approximate functions similar to expression (10) at each grid point based on the values at adjacent grid points, as
shown in Table 1.
4. Put the derived approximate function ur,i(t,x) into Eq. (1) to work out the residuals of the function on intervals (i.e.
x 2 (xi1,xi+1) and t 2 (tr1, tr)) where it stands, and decide whether the residual relation is satisﬁed as required by expres-
sion (8). It shall be noted that, as Fig. 3 shows, space terms have two co-existing approximate functions on grid point
subintervals, except at the grid points at boundaries. So it is necessary to examine both approximate functions.
5. If Step 4 does not hold true, it is necessary to correct the function values at grid points and ﬁnd a new approximate func-
tion according to the instructions given in next section until all necessary residuals are satisﬁed.
3. Residual correction procedure
As stated at the last point in the previous section, when the approximate functions derived by using the ﬁnite difference
method do not satisfy the residual distribution as expected, these functions have to be corrected so that the approximate
solution ~uðt; xÞ consisting of these functions can meet the following constraint conditions:
R~uðt; xÞP 0 in E ð11Þ
or
R~uðt; xÞ 6 0 in E ð12Þ
when it can be ensured that the objective function u
^ðt; xÞ ¼ maxð~uðt; xÞÞ is the optimal lower approximate solution equal to
or less than the exact solution, while the objective function u
_ðt; xÞ ¼ minð~uðt; xÞÞ is the optimal upper approximate solution
equal to or bigger than the exact solution. The residual correction procedure proposed in this paper is similar to the one

Fig. 4 shows the distribution of transient approximate solutions and error analysis of Example 1 when Re = 1. According to
this ﬁgure, the approximate solutions obtained by using the ﬁnite difference method in the architecture of the maximum
principle are always effective in ﬁnding the approximate solutions equal to or larger than the exact solution correctly,
regardless of grid point intervals and time intervals. Moreover, the upper and lower approximate solutions conﬁne the exact
solution into the area between them, like an envelope. So if the mean approximate solution

and Dt = 0.0001. And if Dx and Dt continue to reduce, we can expect to obtain a set of upper and lower approximate solu-
tions which approximate to the analytical solution. Furthermore, this table also shows that the actual error Er of mean
approximate solutions is far less than the maximum possible error. This means that the maximum possible error obtained
in the paper is the worst situation for mean approximate solutions when the exact solution is unknown. In fact, however, as
shown in Fig. 4, the upper and lower approximate solutions are symmetric about the exact solution to some extent, so it is
possible for the error of mean approximate solutions to be far less than the maximum possible error. In this example, in addi-
tion to the number of grid points that may have impact on the error, as shown in Fig. 5, the Burgers’ equation will gradually
become more difﬁcult to solve as the parameter Re increases. The ﬁgure shows that the curve changes sharply near the
boundary x = 1, thus, the analysis on the errors generated by using the method proposed in this paper also shows that
the error at this place is far larger than those at other places as anticipated.

and lower approximate solutions gradually approximate to the exact solution as the grid point interval and time interval
