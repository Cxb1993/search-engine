黃酸鹽可與多種重金屬離子形成不溶性金屬黃酸鹽錯合物，並較 EDTA 具更強螯合能

Abstract 
In this study, the optimum operating condition for the removal of heavy metals from 
electroplating wastewater by insoluble starch xanthate (ISX) were investigated. The operating 
condition such as sulfur/copper molar ratio, reaction time, pH, ORP, chloride and sulfate 
concentration for copper removal were also investigated by batch experiments. Results from 
batch metal removal experiments showed that the removal of copper ion was optimized with 
sulfur/copper molar ratio between 1.8 and 2.5, pH between 3 and 6, and ORP between 200mV 
and 500mV. No significant effect on copper removal efficiency was observed with chloride and 
sulfate concentrations below 5%. Copper ion could even be selectively removal from aqueous 
multi-heavy metal solutions and electroplating wastewater by ISX under the optimum operating 
conditions.

三、文獻探討 
隨著人類追求生活品質的提升，與日常生活息息相關的工業如染整、電鍍、印刷電路板
及半導體業等也蓬勃發展，但也隨之產生許多重金屬廢水污染問題，如未能妥善處理而任
意排棄，則易對河川、土壤及地下水造成相當大的污染。其中以電鍍等金屬表面處理業所
排放的廢水最為嚴重，其產生的廢水中含有毒的重金屬如銅、鎳、鋅、鉻等，若未妥善處
理處置將造成環境危害。行政院環保署(2003)將事業、污水下水道系統及建築物污水處理設
施之放流水標準訂為：銅 3.0mg/L、鋅 5.0 mg/L、鎳 1.0 mg/L、鉛 1.0 mg/L，而目前金屬表
面處理業者大多將高濃度金屬廢液及廢水併入廢水處理廠，以化學混凝沉澱使廢水中金屬
離子產生各類金屬氫氧化物沉降去除。根據經濟部工業局(2002)對電鍍業輔導之資料統計，
台灣電鍍工廠約 3,314家，平均每家電鍍工廠之廢水量約為 53CMD，因此推估產生總排放
量約為 175,600CMD。另外，依據行政院環保署 93年度全年之事業廢棄物上網申報統計資
料顯示，電鍍製程之廢水處理污泥申報量為 25,893噸/年。 
目前電鍍上常用的氰化物本身屬於毒性化學物質而被管制，大多數電鍍業者均改添加
螯合劑（EDTA、Citrate...）以增加鍍液的穩定性，使得排放出的廢水中含有穩定性高的重
金屬螯合物，嚴重影響廢水中重金屬的去除效果，例如以化學沈澱法處理時不易形成重金
屬氫氧化物沈澱去除。因此，目前常用於含重金屬螯合物廢水的化學處理技術，有硫酸亞
鐵法（Wing et al., 1977）、鈣鹽處理法（Spearot et al., 1984）、硫化物沈澱法（Ku et al., 1986）
等，但這些處理技術均需要較長的處理停留時間，且上述重金屬廢水處理技術所產生之重
金屬污泥，若在環境中不具有長期穩定性，且未能有效的回收再利用或適當地處理處置，
則將衍生土壤與地下水的二次污染。而傳統含金屬離子廢水處理方法包括化學沉澱、離子
交換、吸附、逆滲透及薄膜過濾（Bryson and Dardis, 1980; Bailey et al., 1999）等，其中加
鹼化學混凝沉澱為最常使用之方式（Patterson, 1981），該程序所產生的重金屬污泥主要是
以難溶性之金屬氫氧化合物存在，但重金屬與氫氧根離子隨著 pH 值不同會產生各種不同
型態之錯合物，其在水中的溶解度亦隨之不同。在強酸或強鹼之環境下，重金屬氫氧化物
會由不溶態污泥轉而形成溶解態離子，使得重金屬氫氧化物污泥不再具化學穩定性。現國
內金屬表面處理產業廢水處理仍以中和混凝法進行重金屬沉澱分離為主，然而，多數業者
屬小規模者，對於傳統混凝沈澱及添加劑之操控性不易及不適，以致膠羽顆粒形成不佳，
沈澱性不好，影響處理成效。此外，混凝法所產生之重金屬污泥量多且經常具毒害性，需
進一步處理處置（如固化/穩定化）。而根據研究文獻(Tare and Chaudhari 1987; Jawed and Tare, 
1991)顯示，螯合劑如黃酸鹽等，可與重金屬離子形成不溶性金屬黃酸鹽錯合物，因此可將
黃酸鹽應用作為吸附穩定劑以吸附去除/穩定化處理含金屬離子之廢棄物，除可清淨金屬廢
污使其達放流水標準外，所形成生成物亦具較低之金屬溶出特性，多可符合毒性特性溶出
程序（TCLP）要求。

3.0實驗，探討 ISX對銅離子去除效率及吸附模式。圖 2為不同硫/銅比條件下，以 ISX處
理 500mg/L銅溶液之結果。由圖中可發現，當硫/銅比為 1.8、2.0、2.5時，銅離子去除率均
可達 99.9%以上，且其銅離子之殘存濃度皆低於放流水標準(銅：3mg/L)。但當硫/銅比達 3.0
時，可發現其銅離子去除率反而開始不穩定。顯示於適當的添加量下(硫/銅比 1.8-2.5)，ISX
可有效去除水中之銅離子。

(5) 實廠廢水去除效果之探討 
經由先前之實驗可歸納出：ISX 不適於低 pH 值、還原環境，不受高濃度氯鹽、硫酸
鹽等陰離子之干擾。為印證此結果，取南部某電鍍廠所產生之實際廢水進行重金屬吸附去
除實驗。原廢水之 pH值 2.66，ORP值 340 mV，氯鹽 101.6 mg/L、硫酸鹽 380.4mg/L、硝
酸鹽 8.0 mg/L應不會對 ISX去除重金屬產生影響。廢水中原有重金屬濃度：銅 166 mg/L、
鎳 39.9 mg/L、鋅 5.9 mg/L。經 ISX反應處理後，銅、鎳、鋅去除率如圖 4所示，由圖中可
看出，ISX選擇性先去除了溶解度積較小的銅，當銅去除率趨近於 100%時，ISX才開始大
量捕集鋅、鎳。因此，由實驗結果可證實，ISX 與銅、鋅、鎳之反應與溶解度積有關，且
可有效去除銅、鋅達放流水標準，至於鎳部分，則因其溶解度積大，所以無法完全去除。 
惟若使用另一黃酸鹽螯合劑(Potassium butyl xanthate, KBX)，則出現銅＞鎳＞鋅去除之順
序，此與黃酸鹽與金屬離子之溶解度積有關（如圖 5所示）。

Combined Two-Stage Xanthate Processes
for the Treatment of Copper-Containing
Wastewater*
Heavy metal removal is mainly conducted by adjusting the wastewater pH to form
metal hydroxide precipitates. However, in recent years, the xanthate process with a
high metal removal efficiency, attracted attention due to its use of sorption/desorp-
tion of heavy metals from aqueous solutions. In this study, two kinds of agricul-
tural xanthates, insoluble peanut-shell xanthate (IPX) and insoluble starch
xanthate (ISX), were used as sorbents to treat the copper-containing wastewater
(Cu concentration from 50 to 1,000 mg/L). The experimental results showed that
the maximum Cu removal efficiency by IPX was 93.5 % in the case of high Cu
concentrations, whereby 81.1 % of copper could rapidly be removed within one
minute. Moreover, copper-containing wastewater could also be treated by ISX over
a wide range (50 to 1,000 mg/L) to a level that meets the Taiwan EPA’s effluent reg-
ulations (3 mg/L) within 20 minutes. Whereas IPX had a maximum binding capa-
city for copper of 185 mg/g IPX, the capacity for ISX was 120 mg/g ISX. IPX is
cheaper than ISX, and has the benefits of a rapid reaction and a high copper bind-
ing capacity, however, it exhibits a lower copper removal efficiency. A sequential
IPX and ISX treatment (i.e., two-stage xanthate processes) could therefore be an
excellent alternative. The results obtained using the two-stage xanthate process
revealed an effective copper treatment. The effluent (Ce) was below 0.6 mg/L, com-
pared to the influent (C0) of 1,001 mg/L at pH = 4 and a dilution rate of 0.6 h
–1.
Furthermore, the Cu-ISX complex formed could meet the Taiwan TCLP regula-
tions, and be classified as non-hazardous waste. The xanthatilization of agricultural
wastes offers a comprehensive strategy for solving both agricultural waste disposal
andmetal-containing wastewater treatment problems.

1 Introduction
Wastewater generated from industries such as electroplating,
surface finishing, etc., contains heavy metals causing environ-
mental hazards. The treatment of such wastewater for the re-
moval of heavy metal is of great concern for environmental en-
gineering and policy. A variety of methods including chemical
precipitation, ion exchange, adsorption, reverse osmosis and
membrane filtration have been used for the removal and recov-
ery of heavy metals from wastes [1–2]. The chemical precipita-
tion using hydroxide ions to form metal hydroxide precipitate
is the most widely used process [3]. However, metal hydroxide
precipitate may release metals to the environment during dis-
posal and consequently further treatment such as solidifica-
tion/stabilization (S/S) to eliminate the contamination from
metal hydroxide is required. The cement-based S/S process can
be used for effectively treating various hazardous wastes, such
as metal-containing sludges, for a safe disposal in landfills. The
alkalinity of the cement-based paste requires a high pH envi-
ronment and confines metal mobility to solidified matrices. Re-

2.3 Analysis of Copper Xanthate
Complexes
2.3.1 Characteristic Analysis
In order to understand the mechanism of copper
ions removed by IPX and ISX and gain a funda-
mental understanding of the resulting complexes,
the Elemental analysis (EA), Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and Scanning elec-
tron microscopy (SEM) measurements were car-
ried out. These analyses allowed the specimens of
xanthate to be examined before and after copper-
xanthate complex formation. All the experimental
results should facilitate the identification of the
resultant copper xanthate complexes.
2.3.2 Evaluation of the Leaching Toxicity
of the Copper Xanthate Complexes
The TCLP test [12] has been recognized as a means
to classify materials as hazardous or non-hazar-
dous materials. Here, the TCLP test of the pulver-
ized copper xanthate complex (< 9.5 mm) was
carried out using acetic acid solution as a leachant
with a liquid-to-solid ratio of 20 (mL/g). The
TCLP test was conducted at 22 ± 3 °C by tumbling
the specimens for 18 hours. The samples were then
filtered by passing through a 0.7 lm borosilicate
glass fiber filter paper. The TCLP leachate (filtrate)
obtained was analyzed for heavy metals using
atomic absorption spectroscopy to determine the
degree of elution of the components from the solid
specimens.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of Insoluble Peanut
Shell Xanthate and Insoluble Starch Xanthate
Throughout the xanthate preparation process, IPX and ISX
formed were examined by EA and FTIR analyses. The results
are given in Tab. 1. Initially, there was no sulfur in the starch
and peanut shell material. But after the xanthalized proce-
dures, IPX and ISX (the synthesized xanthate product) con-
tained 9.8 % and 11.0 % sulfur, respectively. The subsequent
FTIR analyses essentially confirmed the sulfur insertion. For
example, originally there was no sulfur-bonding signal in corn
starch (see Fig. 2A), but after the xanthalization process, a C=S
bonding of 1,020–1,070 cm–1, a C-S bonding of 830–870 cm–1
and a S-C-S bonding of 1,035 cm–1 [13–14] were found in ISX
(see Fig. 2B), and thus confirmed the sulfur insertion.
3.2 Copper Removal Studies
Firstly, IPX and ISX were used as sorbents to treat the synthetic
copper-containing wastewater (with a Cu content of 500 mg/L)
under various molar S/Cu ratios. The results are presented in
Figs. 3 and 4. The optimum molar S/Cu ratio for IPX and ISX
was 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the molar S/Cu ratio for IPX
and ISX was set at 1 and 2 for the following batch copper
removal experiments.

column) commenced. The effluent (Ce) of the
two-stage xanthate processes was below 0.6 mg
Cu/L, and could meet the Taiwan EPA’s effluent
regulations (of 3 mg Cu/l). Hence, the two-stage
xanthate process is favorable to treat the copper-
containing wastewater effectively.
3.3 Characteristics of Copper Xanthate
Complexes
Fig. 6 exhibits the FTIR spectrum of the Cu-ISX
complex formed and displays the C-O-C, C-H,
C-S and metal-S bonding existing in the Cu-ISX
complex. The SEM micrographs and mapping
analysis (presented in Fig. 7) also confirmed that
the C, O, S, Cu elements exist in the Cu-ISX speci-
men. The results of TCLP showed that the copper
ion concentration was 0.5–1.0 mg/L in the TCLP
leachate of the Cu-ISX complex. The leached cop-
per concentration was much lower than the Taiwan
EPA’s TCLP regulatory limits (of 15 mg/L). Conse-
quently, it is reasonable to conclude that the Cu-ISX complex
is not a leaching-toxin and can be classified as a non-hazar-
dous waste which could be disposed off in sanitary landfills
without further treatment. This characteristic of the Cu-IPX
was also verified by FTIR and SEM measurements. However,
the TCLP result of Cu-IPX was at 144 mg/L, indicating that
further treatment such as a subsequent metal recovery process
is needed.
4 Conclusions
Agro-based waste, peanut shell and starch, could be xantha-
lized to form IPX and ISX as metal-chelating agents. The opti-
mum molar S/Cu ratio for IPX and ISX was 1 and 2 when the
copper-containing solution was treated. IPX had a maximum
binding capacity for copper of 185 mg/g IPX, and ISX had a
capacity of 120 mg/g ISX. However, only ISX could be used to

Abstract: Both xanthate stabilization and cement-based solidification processes are used for 
metal-containing waste treatment, but the formed metal-bearing materials should be much concerned 
about the metal immobilization when being landfilled. In this research, the copper immobilization 
study of both treatments was evaluated by semi-dynamic leach test (SDLT) with 1N acetic acid as 
leachant. The chemical structure variation was examined with UV-vis, FTIR and X-ray diffraction 
analyses. The results of the SDLT revealed that the cumulative fraction of copper released was 0.013 
% and 13.3 % of the stabilized copper xanthate complexes and the solidified copper-containing 
matrices, respectively. Even copper xanthate complexes slightly decomposed during SDLT, it would 
not induce the leaching of copper from the complexes. Both treatments are suitable for 
copper-containing waste treatment, and the xanthate process is concluded to be an alternative and an 
environmental friendly technique.

Dr. Yi-Kuo Chang is an assistant professor at the Department of Safety Health and Environmental 
Engineering, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology. His research interests are in the 
wastewater by the xanthate process (Chang et al., 2002).  The xanthate process is therefore concluded 
to be promising for the treatment of metal-bearing wastes.  
Even though xanthate process exhibits high metal removal efficacy, final disposal through landfill 
of the precipitates of metal-xanthate complex is still required.  Therefore, the long-term observation of 
heavy metal immobilization by the xanthate process should be evaluated.  Once the xanthate process 
demonstrates a good long-term stability for metal immobilization, then direct landfill of metal-xanthate 
complex precipitates may be appropriate.  And this paper is aimed to clarify this matter. 
In this study, the immobilization of copper ion had been conducted by both the xanthate and 
conventional cement-based S/S process.  And the leaching toxicity and long-term stability of the 
derivatives from the both treatments had been tested and evaluated by the toxicity characteristics 
leaching procedure (TCLP) and the semi-dynamic leach test (SDLT), respectively.  During the SDLT, 
chemical analyses, including UV-vis spectrometry, FTIR spectrometry, and XRD, were also performed 
to explicate the possible chemical structure changes of the derivatives from the both processes in an 
acidic environment. 
 
 
2 Materials and methods 
 
2.1 Immobilization of copper ion by xanthate process 
 
The immobilization of copper by the xanthate process was conducted by using potassium n-butyl 
xanthate (KBX, C4H9OCS2K) prepared in our laboratory. A synthetic copper wastewater containing 0.1 
M Cu(NO3)2 (pH = 4) was treated with a 0.2 M KBX solution (pH = 9) at equal volume. By mixing 
both solutions, the precipitation of copper xanthate complex was obtained as the chemical reaction 
expressed below: 
 
+2Cu  + −BX2  →  )(2)( sBXCu          (1) 
 
where BX- is (C4H9OCS2)- and Cu(BX)2 is copper xanthate complex.  
After slow agitation for 30 minutes, the precipitate of copper xanthate complex was collected by 
filtration through a 0.45 µm membrane filter paper, and sequentially vacuum dried and stored in a 
desiccator.  
 
2.2 Cement-based S/S process for immobilization of copper hydroxide 
 
Type I Portland cement was used for the solidification process. Copper hydroxide (Cu(OH)2, Showa, 
Japan) was mixed with cement by equal weight, and distilled water was then added to the cement 
degree/min.  The FTIR spectra were taken in a Bio-Rad Excalibur 3000 FTIR spectrometer using 
diffuse reflectance method. 
 
 
3 Results and discussion 
 
3.1 Leaching hazard of S/S derivatives 
 
Leaching hazards of both the S/S products from the xanthate and cement processes were examined by 
the TCLP results. Only 0.1 mg/L of copper was present in leachate from the TCLP of the S/S product 
obtained by the xanthate process, indicating that the xanthate process was effective for the 
immobilization of copper.  On the other hand, the cement-based solidification produced a solidified 
mass, which exhibited rigid construction with the compressive strength of 93 kg/cm2.  Nevertheless, 
leachate from the TCLP of the solidified mass contained a higher level of copper of 10.5 mg/L, but still 
matched the TCLP regulation (15 mg/L) in Taiwan. From the TCLP results, both the S/S processes 
present a good performance in elimination of copper leaching hazards, and the xanthate process seems 
to demonstrate a better result than the cement-based S/S process for the immobilization of copper 
wastes. 
 
3.2 Long-term performance of S/S processes for copper immobilization 
 
Although the TCLP results indicated that both the xanthate stabilization and cement-based 
solidification processes were effective in reducing the leaching toxicity to pass the regulation.  
Therefore, the derivatives from both S/S processes are approvable for final disposal through landfill.  
Nevertheless, considering the long-term impact of the S/S processes, it is essential to understand the 
possible heavy metal releasing from the S/S products.  Thus, a series of SDLT with a total of 10 
leaching cycles were conducted for this purpose.  Table 1 lists the releasing of copper from the S/S 
derivatives at each leaching cycle of the SDLT.  Even the leachate from each leaching cycle kept 
good acidic buffer at the pH range between 2.15 and 2.54, all the copper ion concentration released 
from the xanthate complex by the SDLT was lower than 0.6 mg/L, far below the effluent discharge 
limit in Taiwan (3 mg/L).  The Cu release phenomenon revealed that the metal leaching from copper 
xanthate complexes might due to the diffusion control.  On the other hand, the release of Cu from the 
cement-based S/S matrix influenced by the surface wash-off significantly, so the fast dissolution of 
soluble salts (see Ca2+ ions) from the product and the depletion of mobile species could be found in the 
initial two leaching (extraction) cycle of SDLT (van der Sloot and Dijkstra, 2004; van Zomeren et al., 
2005).

However, literatures (Sheikh and Leja, 1974; Sun and Forsling, 1997) had reported that xanthate might 
decompose under an acidic environment.  Therefore, the decomposition of xanthate might also happen 
under the acidic condition given by SDLT, and this could be observed by detection of CS2, the major 
decomposition product of xanthate (Tipman and Leja, 1975; Leja, 1982). 
 
Insert Fig 2 
Insert Fig 3 
Insert Table 2 
 
Figure 4 shows the UV-vis analysis results of leachates from the SDLT, and CS2 in the leachates 
were detected by the characteristic absorbance at 206 nm.  Since CS2 was present in the leachates 
from SDLT, the decomposition of copper xanthate complex during the SDLT could be confirmed, and 
inducing the release of copper ion from the copper xanthate precipitates.  Then the effect of SDLT on 
the decomposition of copper xanthate precipitates could be evaluated by the copper ion leaching 
amount.  By comparing the copper ion leaching results in Fig. 1, only a total 0.013% of copper in the 
copper xanthate precipitates was leached out by the decomposition during the SDLT, indicating the 
decomposition caused by the SDLT to be insignificant.  Since no significant structural change was 
observed by both XRD and FTIR analyses, the xanthate stabilized complex should be stable under 
acidic conditions. 
 
Insert Fig 4 
 
In contrast to the xanthate complex, cement solidified mass showed a larger amount of copper 
release during SDLT. The effect of SDLT on the crystalline phases in the cement solidified mass was 
examined by XRD analyses as shown in Fig. 5.  The major identified crystalline phases in the XRD 
pattern (Fig. 5a) of cement solidified mass before the SDLT are alite, ettringite, Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3. 
However, a noticeable alteration of crystalline phases in the cement solidified mass caused by the 
SDLT could be found.  The crystalline phases of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 in the XRD pattern of the 
solidified mass were diminished after the SDLT (Fig. 5b).  Alkalinity of the solidified mass is 
neutralized by acidic condition during leach test, which could also be confirmed from the SDLT 
concentration of calcium in Table 1.  Calcium leaches out in the first two cycles and pH value of 
leachate also drops from 4.18 to 3.83.  In consequence, copper leach out in the first few cycle due to 
the neutralization of alkalinity. 
The phenomena could be also observed by FTIR analyses results shown in Fig. 6.  As listed in 
Table 2, the two board bands at 1420-1490 cm-1 in the FTIR spectrum (Fig. 6a) could be owing to the 
CO32- stretching vibration of CaCO3 in the solidified mass, and the bands at 420 cm-1 and 1102 cm-1 
were assigned as ettringite (Omotoso et al., 1998; Saikia et al., 2002).  Nevertheless, the absorbance 
4 Conclusions 
 
Solidification with cement, in most cases, is a suitable technique to reduce the leachability of copper 
from the wastes. Stabilization with xanthate, in this present work, appears to be another way for copper 
containing wastestream treatment. Although copper xanthate complexes slightly decomposed under 
acidic environment, it would not induce the large leaching of copper.  The release of copper from the 
cement solidified mass might be occurred due to the loss of alkalinity in acidic environments initially, 
but most of copper was successfully immobilized by the cement solidification and was not affected by 
the acidic extraction.  The xanthate process exhibits good copper stability as well as cement-based 
solidification does. Hence, the xanthate process is concluded to be a promising and an environmental 
friendly technique for solving copper-containing wastes.

wastewater. The metal removal experiment was performed to explain how xanthate removes the 
metal ions from solution effectively and economically. And the Elemental analysis (EA) and Fourier 
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were also used to gain a fundamental understanding of the 
complex’s chemical reactions. 
 
 
Materials and methods 
 
Materials 
Preparation of potassium ethyl xanthate: All chemicals used were analytical grade quality. 
Deionized water was used in all experiments. The potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX, C2H5OCS2K), 
was used as a metal chelating agent and prepared according to Vogel and Furniss’ method [8], 
namely by the reaction of potassium hydroxide containing ethyl alcohol (KOH added to excess 
ethyl alcohol ) with CS2 at 10℃. The product was purified by three times of dissolution in acetone 
and recrystallization with petroleum ether [5]. The resultant material was then filtered, washed with 
ether, vacuum dried, and stored in a dessicator. The chemical structure of the xanthate was 
identified using X-ray diffraction and elemental analysis. 
 
Metal removal studies and metal-xanthate complex formation 
The xanthate process, interacting aqueous solutions containing KEX with a synthetic wastewater 
containing Cr3+ Ag+ ions was conducted in this research. In chromium removal experiment, the 
synthetic wastewater was tested at three different chromium concentrations (100, 500 and 1000 
mg/l) to evaluate the metal removal ability of the xanthate. The KEX solution was dosed with a 
KEX/Cr3+ molar ratio of 2 and 3, to form chromium-xanthate (Cr-EX) complexes. Gentle agitation 
was applied during the 30-min contacting period at room temperature. The Cr-EX complex was 
then filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane paper, thoroughly vacuum dried and stored in a 
dessicator. The resultant Cr-EX complexes were identified by use of elemental analysis, X-ray 
diffraction and Fourier-transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses.  The silver-contained solution of 100 
mg Ag/l with a KEX/Ag+ molar ratio of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 was conducted in similar silver removal 
experiments. Various ammonium ions and sulfate ions existing concentrations (500mg/l、
5000mg/l、50000mg/l) and the pH of aqueous solution were also conducted to explicate the possible 
effect of existing inorganic salts and pH environments. Finally, the selectivity of metal removal was 
tested with synthesized mixed metal solution (Hg, Ag and Cr) at 100 mg/l, respectively. The filtrate 
was analyzed for metal ions using ICP-OES to evaluate the metal removal efficiency of the xanthate 
process.

Conclusions 
The academic laboratory is a potential source of heavy metals wasteswater generator, especially the 
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) analysis wastewater. The small amount wastestream is usually 
accompanied with high collection costs and transportation problems. In this work, the performance 
of xanthate processes revealed that it could be an appropriate and competitive alternative to the 
need for local treatment, which could effectively treat wastewaters with a wide range of chromium 
concentrations and 100 mg/l of silver ions to a level that meets the Taiwan effluent limits. The 
optimum KEX/Cr molar ratio and KEX/Ag molar ratio was 3 and 1, respectively, when treating 
metal-bearing solution. No significant effect on metal removal efficiency was observed with high 
sulfate ions and ammonium ions concentration. A constant heavy metal removal was obtained for 
pH value higher than 5.0. And a stoichiometric chromium xanthate precipitate and silver xanthate 
precipitate was formed. Besides that, the xanthate process produces less volume of sludge, 
comparing with those treatments applying hydroxide precipitation combined with cement 
solidification. It was concluded the xanthate process to be a worthwhile alternative for solving 
traditional COD wastewater treatment problems.
