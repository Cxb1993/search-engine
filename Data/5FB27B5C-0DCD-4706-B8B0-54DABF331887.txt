If the point heat source is considered as moving 
along the x-axis at a constant velocity v （m/sec）, and 
then extinguished at t0 . The quasi-steady temperature 
distribution at t1 after the extinguishment of the moving 
source can be obtained by integrating Eq. (1), and

With constant torch velocity ξ=v(to+t1), Eq. (3) can 
be converted into Eq. (4) for a quasi-stationary solution 
of two-dimensional heat flow problem, where welded 
torch is initially applied to the coordinate origin and 
continued welding to t0 in a constant velocity v. In the 
modeling of weld repaired, to may be assumed to 
be , and welding advanced along the 
straight positive x-axis. The quasi-steady solution [2] 
along the x-axis in this modeling [may be evaluated and 
denote in Eq. (5).

The function of K0(z) is the Bessel function of the 
second kind with zero order, and λ=v/2D（m-1）where 
1/λ can be regards as a characterized length denoted as 
a in this thermal-elastic analysis. Eq. (5) may be 
evaluated for the temperature estimation in a weld 
repaired process with constant moving GTAW torch, 
and a numerical example is illustrated in Fig. (2).

3  Thermal Elasticity Analysis in Weld Repaired 
The weld repaired process on a mold holding a 
fatigue generated long crack is investigated in this study. 
The temperature distribution for an instantaneous point 
heat source as denoted in Eq. (1) with boundary 
condition in Eq. (2) had been derived in reference [3] 
and shown in Eq. (6).

(6) 
In Eq. (6),  μ is the shear modulus, m=(1+ν)α for plane 
stress and α is the coefficient of thermal expansion, 
nevertheless in the case of plane strain m=α(1+ν)/(1- ν), 
the geometric parameter 2 2r x y= + . 
 In the weld repaired, the accumulated thermal 
stress due to a moving heat source with constant 
velocity can be achieved by integrating Eq. (6), with 
considering of the same scheme in Eq. (3). With the 
variable change of t=ξ/v, the stress distribution in Eq. (6) 
is then summed up to imitate the induced thermal 
stresses owing to the quasi-stationary moving heat 
source, and it is denoted in Eq. (7) with the same 
circumstance as shown in Fig. (1), where point heat 
source initiated at coordinates origin and moving toward 
the positive x-axis in a constant velocity v.
