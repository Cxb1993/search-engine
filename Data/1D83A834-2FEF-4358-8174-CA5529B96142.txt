1. Introduction 
 Nafion is a material of considerable 
commercial significance because of their 
use as solid polymer electrolytes in fuel 
cells and other applications in 
electrochemistry and separation 
technology in a variety of 
electrochemical process and devices 
including chlor-alkali cells. The 
chemical structure of polymer consists 
of a linear backbone of fluorocarbon 
chains and ethylether pendant groups 
with sulfonic –SO3H cation exchange 
sites. Phase separation between the 
fluorocarbone backbones and ionic 
ethylether pendant –SO3H groups 
happens in the polymer which is 
heterogeneous on nanometer scale. The 
nono-structure of ionic aggregates is 
strongly correlated with proton transport 
properties of membranes. The solution 
casting film is of great interest in order 
to repair pin holes in Nafion chlor-alkali 
membranes or for coating of modified 
electrodes [1]. 
 It has been reported the 
micro-structure of block copolymers can 
be aligned using an electric field [2,3]. 
In this paper, we show that the proton 
conductivity of Nafion membranes can 
be improved by aligning the 
nano-structure of –SO3H groups 
aggregations using an electric field 
along the membrane thickness direction, 
which causes linear, less curved, and 
continuous proton transferring pathways. 
The membranes were prepared by 
solution casing from organic solvents, 
i.e. N,N’-dimethyl acetamide (DMAc), 
N,N’-dimethyl formamide (DMF), and 
N-methyl formamide (NMF), and 
alcohol/water mixture solvents, i.e. 
methanol/water (4/1 g/g), ethanol/water 
(4/1 g/g), and isopropanol/water (4/1 
g/g). The solvents was vacuum dried at 
50oC, which was below glass transition 
temperature Tg of Nafion, and then the 
membrane was annealed and applied 
with an electric field at 135oC, which 
was 35oC above Tg of Nafion (the Tg of 
Nafion is around ~100oC). 
Small angle neutron scattering 
(SANS), small angle X-ray scattering 
(SAXS), electron spin resonance (ESR), 
and dynamic light scattering (DLS) 
experiments have given an insight into 
the structure of Nafion colloid dilute 
solutions [4-10]. The SANS, SAXS, and 
ESR experimental results indicate a 
compact cylinder structure of Nafion in 
alcohol and aqueous solutions, in which 
several Nafion molecules aggregate 
through perfluorocarbon backbone 
hydrophobic interactions and form 
cylinders with ionic side chains 
surrounding the surfaces of cylinders. 
This degree of perfluorocarbon 
backbone hydrophobic aggregations 
increases with increasing dielectric 
constant of solvents and decreasing 
 4
solvents to prepare 10 wt% Nafion 
solutions. Each solution was cast in a 
glass vessel and the solvent was 
evaporated at 50oC (which is below 
Tg=100oC of Nafion) for 30 h, then 
under vacuum at 80oC for another 1 h. 
The membranes were kept at 25oC in 
distilled water at least for one week 
before TGA, DSC, and SAXS 
observations. 
2.2. Electric poling experiments: The 
detail of poling apparatus is similar to 
that described by Amudson et al [2]. The 
Nafion membranes were placed between 
the two electrodes. The distance 
between the two electrodes was 2.0 cm. 
A voltage of 15 kV was applied across 
the two electrodes. Heated nitrogen gas 
flowed through the poling apparatus 
with a temperature of 135oC, which was 
about 35oC above the Tg of Nafion. Two 
electric field alignment experiments 
were performed, one with the Nafion 
membrane surface parallel to the electric 
field (the electric field is vertical to the 
membrane thickness direction), the other 
with the Nafion membrane surface 
vertical to the electric field (the electric 
field is along the membrane thickness 
direction). After electric poling 
experiment each membrane was 
separated into two pieces. One piece the 
membrane was kept at 25oC in distilled 
water (wet membrane) before SAXS and 
TGA observations. The other piece of 
the membrane was kept in a container at 
25oC with a 37%RH (dry membrane) for 
DSC observations. 
2.5. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA): 
TGA observations were performed on a 
Thermal Analysis (TA) Model Q50 TGA. 
The samples sizes were around 5~10 mg. 
Before TGA observations, the surface 
each sample was dried with lens papers 
to clean the water on the surface of 
membrane. The heating rate was 
5oC/min and the N2 flow rate was 20 
ml/min. 
2.6. Differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC): DSC experiments were 
performed on a Thermal Analysis Model 
Q10 DSC. The samples sizes were 5~10 
mg. Before DSC observations, the 
surface each sample was dried with lens 
papers to clean the water on the surface 
of membrane. The heating rate was 
10oC/min and N2 flow rate was 20 
ml/min. 
2.7. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS): 
SAXS observations of Nafion 
membranes were performed at National 
Synchrotron Radiation Research Center 
(NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan. The wave 
length of X-ray was 5 Å. The 
polyethylene (PE) was used as a 
standard to obtain the absolute scattering 
intensity. The power of incident X-ray 
was 5 Å. Each experiment datum was 
collected for 20 min at 25oC. The 
thickness of each sample was around 
~50 μm. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 In the process of polymer 
crystallization, the polymer should be 
annealed at a temperature between TG 
 6
Table 1-b with Table 1-c, we found that 
H-series membranes had higher water 
content than V-series membranes. From 
Tables 1-3, we also found that the 
increase of water content in membranes 
caused a decrease in membranes 
decomposition temperature. The 
presence of water in the membranes 
could accelerate decomposition of ether 
sulfonic acid side chains and the 
decomposition of ether sulfonic acid 
side chains could further accelerate the 
decomposition of main chains. 
3.2. DSC study 
The influence of casting solvents and the 
direction of electric filed on the degree 
of main chain crystallinity and ether 
sulfonic acid side chains aggregations 
for Nafion membranes after annealing at 
135oC for 90 min were investigated 
using DSC. The membranes were kept in 
a container at 25oC with 37%RH before 
DSC experiments. The membranes 
without swelling with water were easy 
for observing Nafion main chains 
crystallinity using DSC. Figures 2-a, 2-b, 
and 2-c show the DSC curves of Nafion 
membranes prepared from various 
solvents without applying electric field 
(N-series membranes), with electric field 
applied vertical to the surfaces of the 
membranes (H-series membranes), and 
with electric filed applied parallel to the 
surfaces of the membranes (V-series 
membranes). Tables 2-a, 2-b, and 2-c 
summarize the data of endothermic peak 
temperatures and enthalpy of each 
endothermic peak. The DSC 
endothermic peak from 30-150oC (T2 
and ΔH2) can be attributed to the 
evaporation of water and the 
dissociation of Nafion side chains ionic 
aggregations. The endothermic peak 
around 200oC (T3 and ΔH3) is the 
melting of Nafion main chain crystalline. 
Comparing Table 2-b with Table 2-a, we 
found that H-series membranes had 
larger ΔH3 endothermic peak than 
N-series membranes. Comparing Table 
2-c with Table 2-b, we also found that 
H-series membranes had higher ΔH3 
endothermic peak than V-series 
membranes. These results suggest that 
applying electric field on the Nafion 
membranes could result in an increase in 
the degree of Nafion main chain 
crystallinity when they were annealed at 
a temperature between TG and Tm. 
3.3. SXAS study 
Figure 3 shows the SAXS curves of 
Nafion membranes prepared from 
solutions casting annealed at 135oC 
without applying electric field 
(N-membranes), with applying electric 
field vertical to the surfaces of 
membranes (H-membranes), and with 
applying electric field parallel to the 
surfaces of membranes (V-series 
membranes). It is known that the 
scattering peak at q~0.07A-1 is related to 
Nafion main chain crystalline and the 
scattering peak at q~0.2A-1 is related to 
the ether sulfonic acid side chain 
aggregations. Table 3 shows the long 
space distances of crystalline (Lcry) and 
sulfonic acid ionic group aggregations

ABSTRACT 
We present a method for fabrication of poly(benzimidazole)/ porous poly(tetra fluorocarbon) 
(PTFE) composite membranes. A coupling agent containing perfluorocarbon sulfonic acid is used as 
an interface between PTFE and poly(benzimidazole) (PBI), which containing –NH groups. The 
porous PTFE substrate is previously impregnated with a diluted coupling agent solution. The 
optimum concentration of a coupling agent solution is that the concentration of coupling agent just 
high enough to cover the surface of the fibers of porous PTFE substrate membranes. The PBI 
solutions are then fabricated onto the PTFE membranes containing coupling agent to prepare the 
proton exchange composite membranes. The PBI-PTFE composite membrane had a film thickness 
of ~22 µm and thus a lower proton resistance than a PBI membrane with a film thickness of ~80 µm. 
The PEMFC single cell tests showed that PBI-PTFE composite membrane had a better performance 
than PBI.
