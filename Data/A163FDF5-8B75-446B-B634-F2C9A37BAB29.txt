flame-hardened Cr/Cu LZ91 surface. This reduces its 
corrosion resistance significantly. On the other 
hand, the corrosion resistance of as-plated Cr/Cu 
LZ91 was not changed after wear test. That is, an as-
plated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen could have good 
corrosion and wear resistance.

bath contained 40 g L−1 CuSO4, 150 g L−1 KNaC4H4O6, 20 g L−1 H3BO3
and a small amount of phosphate to maintain its pH value at 9.8. To
obtain a Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen, the Cu-coated specimen was
further electroplated in an acidic Cu-sulfate bath followed by trivalent Cr
electroplating in a bath consisting of 0.8 M CrCl3·6H2O with urea as a
complexing agent, and a small amount of buffer salts tomaintain the pH
at 1.1 [9]. All the Cu and trivalent Cr electroplating baths are eco-friendly
without any highly toxic chemical components. Some of the Cr/Cu-
coated LZ91 specimens were heated with a reduction-ﬂame for about
0.5 s. The torch length of the reduction-ﬂamewas approximately 20 cm
long. The Cr/Cu-coated specimen was heated approximately at the
center of the torch length so that the whole Cr/Cu-deposited surface
could be heated at the same time.
The corrosion behavior of uncoated and coated LZ91 specimens was
evaluated in an electrochemical three-electrode cell by means of the
anodic polarization test in 0.1 MH2SO4 solution at 27 °C. The uncoated or
coated LZ91 specimen was used as the working electrode. A plantized Ti
mesh and an Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl solution were used as
counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The anodic polarization
behavior of the uncoated and coated LZ91 specimens was evaluated by
potentiodynamic scanning with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 from −0.25 V
(vs. open circuit potential) in the noble potential of 1.6 V (vs. Ag/AgClsat.).
The wear resistance of as-plated and ﬂame-heated Cr/Cu-coated
LZ91 specimenswas evaluatedwith a ball-on-platewear tester by using
a 5 mm steel-ball counterpart with a hardness value of ca. 450 Hv. A
constant load of 10 N was applied normally to the Cr/Cu-coated LZ91
specimen under unlubricated condition at 25 °C. Each wear resistance
test was conducted with a circular track of 3 mm in diameter, a
frequency of 10 Hz and a total sliding distance of 50 m. The wear
resistance of a coated specimen was quantitatively evaluated from its
weight-loss value before and after wear test.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Cu- and Cr-electrodeposition
Fig. 1 shows the potential variation of LZ91, AZ61 and AZ 31 during
anodic etching with a current density of 2 A dm−2 in the alkaline Cu
plating bath. Obviously a potential-plateau could be detected from
each specimen. Moreover, a relatively wide potential-plateau from 50
to 350 s was detected with the LZ91 substrate. The potential of 2.7 V
was detected which is almost the same as those of AZ31 and AZ61
materials. An obvious higher potential of 3.7 V was seen with the
AZ91D material. This implies that the AZ91D alloy is less active than
the other materials. In our previous study [9], we found that a Cu
deposit could be successfully electroplated on a Mg alloy specimen in
an alkaline Cu-plating bath after the Mg alloy specimen is galvanos-
tatically etched to a region corresponding to the potential-plateau.
After galvanostatic etching, the oxides on Mg surface were nearly
removed and an activeMg surface was achieved onwhich a dense and
well bonded Cu deposit can be electroplated [9–11]. According to the
results shown in Fig. 1, the LZ91 has the almost same anodic etching
behavior as that of Mg-Al-Zn alloys. This implies that a Cu deposit
could be electroplated on the LZ91 surface after anodic etching to
potential-plateau in an alkaline Cu plating bath. The Cu-coated LZ91
specimen would be further electroplated in acidic Cu- and then Cr-
plating baths to have a protective Cr/Cu coating.
Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the surface morphology and cross section
of as-plated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen. Typical nodular surface
with few narrow cracks was seen from the as-plated Cr/Cu-coated
LZ91 surface. Clearly, uniform Cu and Cr deposits were deposited on
LZ91 surface. A shinning surface could be visually observed after
1 μm-thick Cr electrodeposition. We have pointed out that the crack
density of Cr deposit could be reduced signiﬁcantly when a soft
undercoat, for example Ni- or Cu-undercoat, is pre-electroplated on
the plating substrate [12]. Since a Cu deposit could be successfully

plated Cr deposit is higher than that of steel-ball counterpart, the
steel-ball counterpart was ground heavily after wear test [see Fig. 5(a)
and (b)]. The ground steel-ball material could adhere on the surface of
Cr/Cu-coated specimen during wear test. As shown in Fig. 7(b),
abundant Fe element signals were detected at the position A in which
the Cr/Cu-coated surface was heavily ground. This implies that some
part of steel-ball counterpart was picked up and then adhered tightly
to the Cr/Cu coating during wear test. Meanwhile, a high Cr-content
was detected on slightly ground surface at the position B shown in
Fig. 7(c), but the typical nodular appearance of Cr deposit was not
found anymore.
The cross-section of worn as-plated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen is
shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that a smooth Cr/Cu coating became to be
concave in appearance. Because a soft Cu undercoat was pre-electro-
plated on the LZ91 surface, it deformed easily during wear test.
However, no any obvious defects, such as peeling, cracking and
detachment, were observed between Cr, Cu and LZ91 surfaces. This
suggests that the worn as-plated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen would
have good corrosion resistance.
Fig. 9(a) and (b) shows the worn surface morphologies of the
ﬂame-heated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen. It can be clearly seen that
wide and broad surface cracks on slightly ground Cr surface in which a
typical nodular surface was still observed. As shown in Fig. 9(b), slight
peeling of Cr deposit could be seen, leading to detection of the Cu
element with EDS. Although the surface hardness of Cr/Cu-coated
LZ91 specimen could be signiﬁcantly increased by means of ﬂame
heating, wide cracks of Cr deposit and peeling of Cr deposit from Cr/Cu
coated LZ91 specimen were observed [see Fig. 6(b)]. This is in fully
agreement with the results of wear test in which more weight loss
was found with the Cr/Cu- deposited LZ91 after ﬂame heating for
0.5 s. Therefore, it can be expected that the corrosion resistance of
ﬂame-heated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen would be reduced after
wear test.
3.3. Corrosion behavior test
Anodic polarization behavior of uncoated- and coated-LZ91 speci-
mens is shown in Fig. 10. Obviously, a very low corrosion potential of
−4.4 V and a high corrosion current density of 2×10−2 A cm−2 were
detected with the LZ91 substrate in a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. That is, the
LZ91 substrate has high chemical reactivity and corrodes easily. The
corrosion potential of LZ91 substrate could be obviously increased to
−0.1 V after Cr/Cu coating. Moreover, the corrosion current density is
approximately ﬁve-order reduced to 1×10−7 A cm−2. The corrosion
potential of ﬂame-hardened Cr/Cu-coated specimen is almost the same
as that of as-plated specimen, but the corrosion current density of
former is about one order higher than that of the latter. This suggests
that the corrosion resistance of as-plated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen
decreases slightly after ﬂame heating for 0.5 s.
In this study, as-plated and ﬂame-hardened Cr/Cu-coated LZ91
specimenswere electrochemically tested in a 0.1 MH2SO4 solution after
wear resistance test. The anodic polarization curves of worn as-plated
and ﬂame-hardened LZ91 specimens can be seen in Fig. 10. Clearly, the
corrosion potential of worn ﬂame-heated specimen increased from
−0.1 V to 0.4 V, but that of worn as-plated specimen decreased from
−0.1 V to −0.4 V. The corrosion current densities of worn specimens
are small and lower than 2×10−6 A cm−2. This implies that as-plated
and ﬂame-heated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimens seem to have a good

4. Conclusions
A uniform Cu deposit could be electroplated on the LZ91 surface
by using anodic etching followed by electroplating in an alkaline Cu
plating bath. The Cu-coated LZ91 substrate could be further elec-
troplated in acidic Cu- and Cr-plating baths to obtain a protective Cr/
Cu coating. The surface hardness of Cu-coated LZ91 could be
increased by means of electrodeposition of 1 μm-thick Cr deposit.
Further increase in the hardness of Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 was achieved
with ﬂame heating for 0.5 s. The wear resistance of LZ91 specimen
could be improved obviously by Cr/Cu electroplating. According to
electrochemical corrosion test in a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution, as-plated
and ﬂame-heated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimens have high corrosion
resistance. However, owing to peeling of Cr deposit from some
portions on the surface of Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen, the cor-
rosion resistance of ﬂame-heated Cr/Cu-coated LZ91 specimen re-
duced obviously after wear resistance test. The Cu-coated LZ91 has
deﬁnite good corrosion and wear resistances after 1 μm-thick Cr
