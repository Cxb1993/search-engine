Introduction 
Everything in the world we live in has its own color, which reflects to our eyes through the illumination of 
sun light, enabling us to see a colorful world.  Therefore, lighting describes the history we have gone through 
and enriches our living space [1]; as a result, lighting design is one of key steps to select appropriate light 
sources.  LED is the solid-state light source of the 21st century.  It features compact size, long service life, 
high reliability and performance, making it a choice of lighting that is energy efficient, and 
environmental-friendly[2].  LED has been used in large quantities in consumer products such as cell phones 
and laptops, and is now making its way into indoor lighting business [3]. LED features colors ranging from 
white to almost any color in the entire spectrum. LED lights create static or dynamic illumination in indoor 
lighting applications.  We hope to create different types of light source and lighting effects with light path 
design, which will allow us to create different scenarios of use and improve our perception of living arts and 
aesthetics.  For example, LivingColors decorative lights produced by Philips [4] create a different 
atmosphere in the living quarter with the multiple colors and low energy consumption of four LEDs, as shown 
in Fig. 1; therefore, modern light design and applications are tightly linked to the visual color perception and 
cognitive perspectives of users in both physical and psychological aspects [5-7].

There are two approaches to generate the colors from LEDs; the first is to use short wavelength LEDs and 
add phosphors during packaging to create white light, as shown in Fig. 2(a)[8]; and the other is to employ 
three monochromatic sources, red, blue and green (RGB) to create white light with specific color temperature 
using external circuit to control its color mixing ratio, as shown in Fig. 2(b) [8].  The RGB coloring mixing 
technique provides better color rendering [9, 10].  One of the most important characteristics of light sources 
for general lighting is color rendering.  Color rendering is a property of a light source that tells how natural 
the colors of objects look under the given illumination [9, 10].  In 2002, Muthu et al. [11] presented an LED 
light source made of red, green, and blue LEDs can provide the unique feature of color variability, allowing 
the user to select the desired color point of lamp.  Light sources used RGB mixed LEDs have best overall 
characteristics to be used as reading or task lights [12, 13].  Therefore, the use of RGB LEDs for color 
mixing gives us multiple light sources, and the color cognition from its light colors is much closer to the 
demands that meet our eyes.  Today, the color mixing technique employing RGB LEDs requires mainly the 
placement of three RGB chips in a single package.  With different alignment of RGB and the adjustment of 
currents passing through these chips, the color mixing effects can be achieved by controlling the color mixing 
ratio with the change of light flux emitted by each individual LED [12-15].  However, the LED color mixing 
technique based on RGB colors requires the package of the BRG chips in on single space for the creation of

Experiment Model 
From Fig. 3, it is clear that RGB LEDs chips are mounted on the couple link on each of the three four-bar 
linkages, and the couple links have an inclining angle that is designed to produce a light focusing and color 
mixing effect as the mechanism operates to project RGB on a surface, thus creating local scenario 
illumination.  At this point, an software: SolidWorks was used to simulate the operation of mechanism, and 
it was learned that the focusing and mixing effects of the RGB lights.  From the light tracks as the lights 
were projected on the surface, the area of RGB color overlapping was calculated.  The color overlapping 
areas were calculated at an angle ranging from 25 to 65 degrees.  The result shows that the optimal 
overlapping occurred at the angle of 40 degrees and it produced better effects for local scenario color mixing.  
Therefore, a color mixing mechanism was designed by incorporating one couple link inclining at 40 degree, 
two crank links as input and output links and one as a ground link.  Furthermore, the optical simulation 
program LightTools was used as the color mixing tool to simulate color mixing for this mechanism. 
In the optical simulation, the distribution curve of luminous intensity in the light source conditions of the 
LED chip mounted on the couple link was measured from the actual chips, as shown in Fig. 4(a).  The 
wavelengths of the RGB chips were measured as well, as shown in Fig.  4(b).  For lighting conditions, the 
number of lumens or light flux were the measurements of actual products.  The projection distance from 
light source was set at 100mm.
