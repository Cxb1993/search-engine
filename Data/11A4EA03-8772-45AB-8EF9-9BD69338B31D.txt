estimated of distillation compositions from multiple

comparison of ICA and PCA is also available by 
Yoo et al. (2004). 
 
The objective of this work is to derive a novel soft 
sensor by integrating the statistical key variable 
selection with an adaptation approach. The 
superiority of this approach is to narrow down the 
inferring fast measuring variables to some key 
variables so that the model becoming easy to 
maintain. On the other hand, by introducing the 
concept of adaptation, the model structure will reflect 
the current scenario of the plant, thus the accuracy of 
the soft sensor can be substantially improved.  This 
paper is organized as the follows.  In section 2, the 
novel methodology is derived. Section 3 describes 
the industrial distillation system. The main results are 
discussed in section 4. Finally, the conclusive 
remarks are given. 
 
 
2. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT 
 
 
2.1 Problem Statement 
 
Consider a plant with a set of n online detectable 
measurement ( ) ( ) ( ){ }1 2, , , nX x t x t x t= "  and a set 
of quality variable Y; assume that Y can also be 
measured with a much slower frequency than X.  For 
the ease of discussion, let’s only consider a single 
quality variable case, Y = y.  Then, let the plant be 
expressed by: 
 
( ) ( ) ( )( ),y t f U t D t=                              (1) 
 
where U are the internal states and D are the slow-
varying known/unknown disturbances from outside 
and t is the time.  It is also general that: 
 
( ) ( ) ( )( ),X t g U t D t=                            
(2) 
 
Now, assume that a set of on-line measurement that 
is collected in the following discrete time form: 
 { }( ), 1,..., , 1,...,ij ij ix x x t j T i n j HΩ = = − Δ = =     (3) 
 
where ΔT is a constant sampling time interval, 
subscript j indicates the jth observation of the online 
measurement variable collected in a time horizon H. 
Let’s also assume that a set of quality variable is also 
available: 
 { },..., 1,0,1,...,k j p fy j K K+Φ = = − −               (4) 
 
where subscript j indicates the jth observation of y. 
Now, let’s separate the observation into the following 
two categories: 
 { }
{ }
, 1,...,
, 1,...,
p k j p
f k j f
y y j K
y y j K
−
+
Φ = =
Φ = =
                       (5) 
 
where Φp indicates the information received before 
current time, while Φ f refers the information that 
will be received in the future. The objective of a soft 
sensor is to estimate slow measured/unmeasured y 
using X.  Assume that the structure of the soft sensor 
is in the following form: 
 
             ( )1 1, , ,k k k k Hy h X X X+ − −= Θ + Σ"               (6) 
 
where Θ is a set of parameters, Σ is a set of white 
noise.  The ultimate goal of a soft sensor is to 
minimize the following:

Since the future information is not available currently, 
a general approach to develop a soft sensor is based 
on the current information set Φp.  The real problem 
to be solved is as the following:

             (8) 
 
Let’s define that the length of horizon H that the 
online information is collected be the regression 
horizon.  It should be noted that this horizon, as 
discussed in the next section, should be determined 
based on the structure of the model. On the other 
hand, the length of time horizon Kp is the other 
identification horizon to be determined. In this work, 
a recursive parameter updating algorithm based on 
Kalman filtering theory is proposed to solve this 
problem as shown below. 
 
 
2.2 A Statistical Model Based on Stepwise 
Regression 
 
In this work, it is assumed that in a particular 
identification horizon Kp, there exists an optimal 
regression horizon H such that the following linear 
model is a solution of (8): 
 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )1 1 1 2 2 2ˆ m m m ty t w t k T w t k T w t k Tθ θ θ η= − Δ + − Δ + − Δ +"    (9) 
 
where iw X∈ , i=1,…,m, while ηt should be white 
noise ideally. In this work, the key variables wi ∈W, 
are determined based on standard statistical stepwise 
regression as below (Montgomery, 1997): 
     4
model should be rebuilt. To avoid the affect of 
measurement noise, it should be bigger than the 
noise level and can be determined by the operator.

3. PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
 
Figure 2 shows a flowsheet of an industrial-scale o-
xylene distillation column located in the Refining & 
Manufacturing Research Institute of CPC 
Corporation in Taiwan. The 56-stage column, 
including a total condenser and a partial reboiler, is 
operated at 1.57 kg/cm2. Its pressure drop is assumed 
to be 0.18 kg/cm2. A fifteen-component mixture with 
194.2 kmol/h is fed to the stage 27, numbering from 
the column top. The column is simulated by using 
ChemCad. The liquid phase activities were 
calculated by using SRK. Table 1 shows the fifteen 
component compositions of feed, distillate, and 
bottom, respectively at nominal operating condition.  
Distillate and bottom flow rates are 80.54 kmol/h and 
113.66 kmol/h, respectively. It should be noted that 
the feeding, product, and column specifications are 
similar to the industrial case. The column is sized as 
a tray-column with diameter 3 m. The 
isopropylbenzene (IPB) purity at the distillate of the 
column is required not to exceed 0.5 mol%. An on-
line GC was installed to detect distillate IPB 
composition. However, composition sensor suffers 
from measurement delay. In addition, the 
measurement also suffers from operating 
perturbations within the column, which result in 
uncertain indication of the average quality. In order 
to improve IPB control quality, real-time estimation 
of IPB purity is required and a composition soft 
sensor is desired to be developed by temperature 
measurements. A number of temperature sensors 
located at stages 1, 13, 23, 31, 44, 45, and 56 are 
installed in the column to monitor overhead IPB 
purity.

4. SIMULATION EXAMPLE 
 
Consider the case shown in figure 3, the input 
components change like figure (3a) and the IPB 
purity response is shown in figure (3b). Procedures 
suggested in section 2.5 are implemented and the 
result is shown in figure 4. It is noted that when the 
input component 1,2,3-Trimethylbenzene changed at 
1200th min, the model structure remained unchanged 
and large predicting error can be observed. Then we 
collect data and rebuild the model, new key variables 
are selected. The predicting error is small when 
1,2,3-Trimethylbenzene changed again at 2000th min. 
 
It can be seen that the proposed algorithm works well 
when the key variables are selected properly. 
However, in some cases, when the process has strong 
nonlinearity and the key variables are not selected 
correctively, the proposed algorithm may have bad 
performance or even failed.
