Abstract (英文摘要) 
Background/Purpose: Little information related to the treatment effects of the occipitomental anchorage 
(OMA) appliance of maxillary (Mx) protraction combined with chincup traction is available. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the treatment effects of the OMA orthopedic appliance on patients with Class III 
malocclusion. Methods: Pretreatment and post-treatment cephalometric records of 20 consecutively treated 
patients with Class III malocclusions were evaluated and compared with a matched sample of 20 untreated 
Class III control subjects. Results: The OMA appliance is effective for correcting skeletal Class III 
malocclusion in growing children. The treatment effects of this orthopedic appliance were considered to be 
from both skeletal and dentoalveolar changes. The skeletal effects were mainly obtained by stimulating 
forward growth of the Mx complex with negligible rotation of the Mx plane and restraining forward 
advancement of the mandible (Mn) with backward and downward rotation of the Mn plane. The observed 
dentoalveolar effects were mostly due to the labial tipping movement of the Mx incisors. Conclusion: Our 
results suggest that the OMA orthopedic appliance can correct the mesial jaw relationship and negative incisal 
overjet. This appliance is effective for correcting skeletal Class III malocclusion with both midface deficiency 
and Mn prognathism in growing children.

OMA appliance 
The OMA appliance used in the present study is shown in Figure 1. The force for Mx protraction of 200–250 
g was applied at each side. Elastics ran at an angle of 5°–10° downward to the occlusal plane from the buccal 
hooks on the upper first molars to the horns extending from the chincup. The retraction force on the mandible 
by chincup was 200–250 g each side. The upper first molars were reinforced for anchorage by a modified 
Nance appliance connecting the lingual bar with the vertical tubes and posts (ST Lock, Sankin Trading Co., 
Tokyo, Japan) semifixed on the lingual aspect of the bands on the Mx molars. Patients were instructed to wear 
the appliance for 12 hours/day. 
Cephalometric analysis 
Lateral cephalometric radiographs taken at two different times, at the pretreatment or initial stage (T1) and at 
the post-treatment or final stage (T2), of two groups were used. The magnification of each cephalograph used 
in this study was 10%, which was not corrected. Twenty-nine craniofacial landmarks were identified and 
digitized (Figure 2). 
A horizontal reference plane (x-axis) and a vertical reference plane (y-axis) of the x–y coordinate system 
were created.19,20 The x-axis was registered on sella and defined by the Frankfort horizontal parallel plane. 
The y-axis was perpendicular to the x-axis passing sella (Figure 3). 
Horizontal and vertical linear measurements were made on the following eight landmarks relative to the 
x–y coordinate system: anterior nasal spine (ANS), posterior nasal spine (PNS), point A, point B, incisal edge 
of the Mx incisor (UIE) or upper incisor incisal edge (Mx1), mesial contact point of the Mx first molar (UMC) 
or upper first molar mesial contact (Mx6), incisal edge of the Mn incisor (LIE) or lower incisor incisal edge 
(Mn1), and mesial contact point of the Mn first molar (LMC) or lower first molar mesial contact (Mn6). Mx 
length was measured by the projected distance between the pterygomaxillary fissure (Ptm) and point A to the 
maxillary plane (A-Ptm/MxP). Mn length was measured by the distance between condylion (Cd) and gnathion 
(Gn) (Cd–Gn). Measurements of the SNA, SNB, ANB, SN–MxP, SN–RP, SN–MnP, gonial, U1 to FH and L1 
to MnP angles, incisal overbite and overjet were taken. The software used in this study was written in the 
“MATALAB 5.3” (Version 2.3, CAESAR Lab, NCKU, Taiwan). 
In order to assess errors involved in cephalometric tracing and digitizing, 30 randomly selected lateral 
cephalographs were traced and digitized. The same cephalographs were retraced and redigitized after an 
interval of 1 week. Correlations between the double measurements were then analyzed for both angular and 
linear measurements.21 Method error (ME) was calculated by the Dahlberg formula: ME=√Σd2/2n22 where d 
is the difference between two measurements of a pair and n is the number of double measurements. The MEs 
were < 0.30 mm for linear measurements and not exceeding 0.60° for angular measurements. The reliability 
coefficients were from 0.973 to 1.00, indicating a high level of reliability. The combined ME in locating, 
superimposing and measuring the sagittal and vertical changes of the different cephalometric landmarks in the 
x–y coordinate system did not exceed 0.85 mm for any of the variables measured. The reliability coefficients 
were from 0.956 to 1.00, indicating a high level of reliability. 
Statistical analysis 
The two-sample t test was performed on T1 between the treated and control groups. The paired t test was 
performed between T1 and T2 (intragroup comparison) and the two-sample t test was performed on the 
cephalometric changes (T2–T1) between the treated and control groups (intergroup comparison).

group, −0.8°; p < 0.001).  
Dental changes 
The mean change in the U1 to FH angle and the horizontal position of the Mx incisor tip (Mx1-x) showed a 
significant labial tipping movement of the Mx incisors when compared with the treated group (Table 2; 8.2°, 
p < 0.001 and 6.0mm, p < 0.0001); the changes were also significant in comparison with the control group 
(Table 3; p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). On the contrary, the mean change in the L1 to MnP angle 
and the horizontal position of the mandibular incisor tip (Mn1-x) were not statistically significant when 
compared with the treated group (Table 2). Even though the change in the L1 to MnP angle was not 
significant in comparison with the control group, the horizontal change of the Mn incisor tip was significant in 
comparison with the control (Table 3; treated group, 0.0 mm and control group, 2.3mm; p = 0.001). Thus, in 
the treated group, there was a significant change in the incisal overjet from negative to positive values, with a 
mean increase of 5.7 mm (Table 3, p < 0.001). 
   A significant forward and downward eruption of the Mx molars (Mx6-x and Mx6-y) was observed in the 
treated group (Table 2, p<0.0001). But there was no significant difference in terms of horizontal and vertical 
change in comparison with the control group (Table 3). A significant forward and downward displacement of 
the Mn molars (Mn6-x and Mn6-y) was observed in both the treated and control groups (Tables 1 and 2, p < 
0.01 and p = 0.001; p < 0.01 and p < 0.001), but the range of difference between the groups did not reach 
statistically significant levels (Table 3). 
Treated example case 
A female case in early permanent dentition at pretreatment and post-treatment with the OMA appliance 
therapy in the treated group is illustrated by cephalometric radiographs with cephalometric analyses and 
lateral profile photographs (Figures 4 and 5). 
Discussion 
For a long time, skeletal Class III malocclusions were thought to arise primarily from overgrowth of the 
mandible. Traditional management of developing Class III malocclusions usually involved chincup therapy or 
orthopedic appliance treatment to restrain Mn growth, camouflage techniques to advance Mx1 and retract 
Mn1, or waiting until growth ceased to pursue orthognathic surgery. However, studies show that the skeletal 
Class III children with both Mx retrusion and Mn protrusion made up 15.0–28.0% of Class III patients.23,24 
   The orthopedic appliances used for Mx protraction may involve either a facemask/protraction headgear or 
be used in combination with a chincup. The Mx teeth regions become the point of force application, and the 
face (forehead, chin), top of head or occipital area become the sources of anchorage. Facemask or protraction 
headgear uses the chin and forehead for anchorage.25–27 Mx protraction headgear combined with a chincup 
uses the chin and the top of the head for anchorage.28–31 The OMA appliance of Mx protraction combined 
with a chincup uses the chin and occipital area for anchorage.13–17 The chincup portion of the orthopedic 
appliance applies retraction force to the mandible. 
   Mx protraction is recommended for developing skeletal Class III patients with Mx deficiency.25–27 
Appliances, which combine Mx protraction and chincup traction, are appropriate for skeletal Class III patients 
showing both midface deficiency and Mn prognathism.32 Combining Mx protraction therapy for the midface 
deficiency with the necessary Mn retraction strategy often produces satisfactory results. Skeletal Class III

shape changes are more easily visualized suggestive by means of grid deformations. 
   The ultimate treatment goal of skeletal Class III patients should not only be the correction of the jaw 
relationship and negative incisal overjet related to mesial occlusion at that stage, but also the stabilization of 
the intermaxillary skeletal and dental relationships resulting from orthopedic appliance therapy. Thus, close 
observation and follow-up of excessive Mn development and deficient Mx growth during adolescence, 
particularly during phase II orthodontic treatment, is essential. 
   In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that the OMA appliance of Mx protraction combined with 
chincup traction is effective for correcting skeletal Class III malocclusion with midface deficiency and Mn 
prognathism in growing children. The study also suggested that the treatment effects of this orthopedic 
appliance may be considered to be from skeletal and dentoalveolar changes. The skeletal effects were mainly 
obtained by stimulating forward growth of the Mx complex with negligible counterclockwise rotation of the 
MxP and restraining forward advancement of the mandible with backward and downward rotation of the MnP. 
The dentoalveolar effects were mostly due to the labial tipping movement of the Mx incisors. Further 
longitudinal long-term studies are required to fully ascertain the long-term stability of OMA orthopedic 
therapy.
