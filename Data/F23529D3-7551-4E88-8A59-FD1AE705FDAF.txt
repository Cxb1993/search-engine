一、摘要 
本計畫之目的在於研究如何在 IEEE 
802.16e全球互通微波存取網路 (Worldwide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access ，
WiMAX) 中使用賽局理論提出以使用效能
(utility)為基礎之資源分配演算法。 IEEE 
802.16e WiMAX能提供高速率、高行動性以
及大範圍的無線網路存取，是建構未來第四
代行動通訊的可能技術之一。IEEE 802.16 
WiMAX技術可根據連線之間的等級差異給
予不同之系統資源以支援用戶的服務品質 
(Quality of Service, QoS)。然而，資源分配
在 IEEE 802.16標準仍是一個開放議題。另
一方面，我們亦需要一個良好的換手請求演
算法，藉以降低換手過程中所造成的連線延
遲與中斷率，以改善行動用戶的服務品質。
相對於即時性與非即時性服務，換手連線與
新進連線由於傳輸情境不同，也應該於資源
分配時區分優先順序。在本次計畫中，我們
分析了即時、非即時、換手與非換手用戶之
間的資源分配優先順序。不同於目前已提出
的資源分配法，我們的方法同時考慮了兩種
屬性(如：換手狀態下的非即時服務用戶)。
我們運用納許議價均衡設計以使用效能為
基礎之資源分配演算法。憑藉本計畫的研
究，我們期許未來對於 IEEE 802.16 WiMAX
的系統設計有更徹底的了解。

Abstract 
In this project, we investigated the 
utility-based resource allocation problem via a 
game theoretical approach for IEEE 802.16e 
Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) networks. 
The IEEE 802.16e Worldwide Interoperability 
for Microwave Access (WiMAX) network is 
one of the most promising solutions to provide 
ubiquitous wireless access with high data rates, 
high mobility, and wide coverage. In IEEE 
802.16e BWA networks, the Base station (BS) 
could categorize the session flows by different 
QoS (quality of service) classes to improve 
the resource efficiency and also users’ 
satisfaction. However, it remains an open 
issue for resource allocations in the IEEE 
802.16 standard. On the other hand, it is also 
needed an elegant handoff algorithm which 
provides low handoff latency and also low 
dropping rates to improve QoS for mobile 
subscriber stations (SS). In contrast to real and 
non-real time services, handoff and 
new-incoming connections should also be 
prioritized in their resource allocations due to 
different transmission scenarios. In this 
project, we analyzed the priorities of resource 
allocations between real time, non-real time, 
handoff, and non-handoff users. Differing 
from the existing resource allocation 
approaches, our approach considers the two 
attributes jointly, e.g. users with non-real time 
services in handoff. We will use a Nash 
bargaining solution (NBS) to design our 
utility-based resource allocation algorithm. 
With our investigations in this project, we 
hope to thoroughly provide an in depth view 
about the system design of IEEE 802.16 
WiMAX in the future.

內，控制所有的通信傳輸和管理數據資源，
因此，這個基地台發射數據資料時不需要和
其他基地台協調。所有的傳輸都與用戶單向
連接，這是基於服務品質參數在一個服務流
(Service flow)的特徵上，例如，容忍延遲和
最小/最大流量速率。連接可以是下行（從
基站到用戶站）和上行鏈路（從用戶站到基
站）的，分別為每一條下行鏈路和上行鏈路
進行認證。這個下行鏈路和上行鏈路認證的
連接，是獨立且位於不同區間的物理層，例
如，正交分頻多重存取（ Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiple Access）的框
架。通道的下行鏈路是一個廣播頻道，而上
行鏈路通道是幾個用戶共享的方式認證，一
個用戶要求其需要的帶寬，由基站它通過排
程機制分配所有的請求。Fig. 2 顯示了上行
鏈路的排程結構。一開始 SS 先發送連線請
求(connection request)向 BS請求建立連線，
此時 BS 的連線允入控制 (connection 
admission control)會先判斷目前是否還有足
夠的頻寬可以提供且不會破壞現有連線(已
被建立連線)的 QoS。當連線建立後，連線
分類器(Connection Classifier)會根據每個連
線的識別碼(Connection Identifier Code)將來
分類並放入到對應的佇列中。基地台的排程
器會根據連線的服務種類，使用週期性或競
爭性的方式，或依據連線建立時的要求來分
配帶寬。上傳連線頻寬分配的結果最後放在
上傳配置圖(UL-MAP)，其中包含二維（時
間和頻率）通道分配訊息。上傳配置圖標示
了何時由哪個用戶可以使用哪些子通道傳
輸多久時間。要注意的是，基地台對於頻寬
分配的方式是以每個用戶為基礎的，並非以
個別連線為基礎。因此，用戶必須再經由內
部排程器將獲得的頻寬分配給各個連線。 
近年來由於無線接取（ Broadband 
Wireless Access，BWA）技術的進步，行動
多媒體服務例如影音串流服務、網路電視、
視訊會議等需求也隨之大幅提升。多媒體服
務具有即時性的特色，對於服務品質的要求
例如最大頻寬需求、最小頻寬需求、容許延
遲時間和抖動率等均有明確的規範。根據國
際行動電信進階標準(IMT-Advanced)定義
之 4G行動網路，新一代的通訊網路需要具
備高速下的寬頻功能以滿足無所不在
(ubiquitous)的行動寬頻服務使用者。新興的
IEEE 802.16e移動式WiMAX是其中適合的
解決方案之一。WiMAX在媒體存取控制層
能根據服務流要求的服務品質參數例如最
小頻寬需求和容許最大延遲時間進行允入
控制決策以及分配頻寬。移動用戶透過更換
基地台來保持連線的行為通稱換手，許多研
究均指出換手行為會嚴重影響用戶的連線
品質與滿意度，傳統做法中，換手連線可使
用專屬頻寬以提高允入機會。為了進一步提
升換手連線的允入與效率，研究[5]提出動態
調整專屬頻寬以保持換手連線的允入機
會，而研究[6]則更進一步的改良動態調整的
機制，在提升換手連線效率的同時保護一般
新進連線的允入權力。上述的相關研究，雖

有所差異，此差異性可運用來設計達成多數
用戶 QoS 的演算法[12][13]，而在進行演算
法設計前，找出一個可準確表達用戶 QoS
的傳輸使用率函式，對於達成整體網路下的
最大限度用戶服務有著決定性的影響。 
頻寬分享(bandwidth sharing)包含頻寬
分配 (bandwidth allocation)與允入控制
(admission control)，用戶資訊統合可以找出
不同協定所相對映的 QoS[14][15][16]，但是
上述步驟並不包含細部需求的確認，為了進
一步了解這些細部需求，頻寬分享機制因此
被提出來研究，目前的做法分為兩大類：理
想性分流與適應性分配。WiMAX基地台會
針對其下節點所提的 QoS 分配自己所掌管
的頻寬，但是一個節點可能同時執行不一樣
的網路服務(如一邊用 FTP 傳送檔案、一邊
看 YouTube上的影片)這時，理想的 QoS會
向基地台請求兩種不一樣的頻寬，在節點少
時，如此請求不會影響到整體傳輸，但是當
節點一多，這樣的請求請使得傳輸複雜化且
降低效益。所以，一般性的做法是將這兩種
頻寬經由計算找出一個整體值再做分配，如
果過程中有改變(譬如影片結束了)，則做一
個適應性的調整增加或減少所配給的頻
寬。允入控制[5][6][12][15]，則可以解決換
手連線的問題。通常無線網路會保留部分頻
寬來為換手的新連線作準備，但保留過多頻
寬會降低新連線的使用率，而過多的新連線
使用頻寬則會讓換手連線無法進入，因此，
研究頻寬保留對於無線網路資源使用率的
動態變化，將可提高頻寬使用效率。 
在本計畫中我們研究基於 QoS 滿意度
的 使 用 效 能 函 數 (QoS-based Utility 
Function)，並分析換手連線用戶的 QoS滿意
度，以設計基於使用效能的頻寬分配 
(Utility-Based Bandwidth Allocation) 演算
法。本計畫與目前的國內外研究之異同，在
於換手連線與即時服務連線的頻寬競爭，此
兩種連線於用戶端都有類似的特性，對延遲
敏感、頻寬急迫性等，相較於即時服務[17]，
鮮少有研究針對換手連線滿意度找出合理
定義，這也使其 QoS 定義陷入模糊，始終
無法如即時與非即時服務進行對照討論。圖
4為即時性與非即時性服務使用率曲線，其
隨給予頻寬變化並常用於探討 QoS 差異與
相關研究。 
最後，本計畫引用賽局理論幫助尋找
「最適頻寬分配」設計演算法，以[12][13]
為例，此兩篇文獻示範了以用戶為出發點的
競爭賽局，我們將於下簡述其研究內容。[12]
透過最佳回應(best response)尋找納許強勢
均衡(dominate equilibrium)，運算式最為簡
單，但是需要收集的節點資訊量最高，構成
策略集合(strategy set)矩陣的時間極長，對於
動態環境的調適性不佳，容易造成超載
(overhead)現象，使得資源利用率低落。[13]
利 用 史 坦 貝 克 賽 局 (Stackelberg 
leader-follower game)找出最佳的計價模
式，而後，使用基因演算法(genetic algorithm)
幫助 WiMAX 基地台和 APs/routers 收集齊
下節點的頻寬需求資訊以便調整計價函
數。競爭賽局做法的優點在於減少用戶端計
算的依賴，缺點是達到均衡的過程中，可能
會因過於頻繁的回覆，造成基地台端的負荷
(overhead)，且使用史坦貝克賽局設計對跟
隨者 (followers)本身即是一個小中求大策
略，先天上有獨厚先行者(leader)的缺陷。 
四、所提出之基於效用的 CAC機制 
4. 1. 效用函數 
效用函數描述了用戶在給定資源數量服
 8
及非即時性服務的換手連線。特別是對於換
手連線的值，即 α設為 1.7。 
如 Fig. 4，對於每種訊務流，在被分配
的資源以及相應的效用(例如:用戶滿意度)
之間的關係彼此是呈現單調函數(monotonic 
function)。也就是說， 我們可以得到所需的
效用函數程度 u之頻寬 b，它們之間的關係
如下: 
)(1 uUb x
-=       (5) 
1-
xU 是 xU  的反函數(inverse function)；此 
x 的形式分別 r、nr、H_r或者 H_nr。其個
自對應到的是即時性服務的新連線、非即時
性服務的新連線、即時性服務的換手連線以
及非即時性服務的換手連線。 
4. 2. 基於效用的CAC演算法 
基於效用函數的技術，在效用方面，可
以獲得資源分配的效益。有了這個資訊，因
此我們將設計了 CAC 機制來提高整體的效
用。令 B 是基地台內可用的頻寬資源以及 
bi 是第 i個連線所被分配到的頻寬資源。第 
I 個連線的效用函數可以被表示成 )( ii bU ，
此 )(×iU  是和第 i 個連線的訊務流類型相
關，可以經由本研究中的式子 Eq. (1)、 (2)、 
(3)、 或者 (4) 來做個別表示。假設在網路
中有 n 個帶有被分配到總資源的新連線， 
å
=
=
n
i
i
total bb

。 因此，n 個新連線的總體效用
utotal可以被表示如下: 
)(

我們所設計的 CAC 機制之目標就是要

CAC機制， 在網路中被認可的連線是必須
被選擇的，以便最大化總體效用。假設有 n 
個已經存在的連線以及 m 允入到個別頻
寬需求網路中的連線請求。 定義有 i 個連
線的邊際效用函數(marginal utility function) 
)(×iu ，其式子如下:

 的條件下，對於允入 m 個連
線請求之中，我們 CAC 的演算法將會有 k 
個較高邊際效用函數 )( kk bu 被認可。只要
我們在每次允入選擇的時間點當中，選擇一
個最高的邊際函數，因此最佳的 CAC 機制
可以在最大的效用函數下被提供。

以及平均離開率(departure rate)的卜瓦松程
序(Possion process)，平均離開率為平均到達
率的十分之一。這四種不同的訊物流類型的
發生機率假設為均勻分布(Uniform)。rtPS以
及 BE 的最小平寬需求 
ibmin  以及最大平均 
ibmax  呈現在 Table 2。我們透過靜態最大最
小 (Static-Min-Max)機制[21]以及頻寬適應
性(Adapt)機制[12]的比較來檢查我們 CAC
機制演算法的效能。對於即時性服務，靜態
最大最小機制採用最大平寬請求 ibmax  ，而
對於非即時服務則採用最小平寬請求 
ibmin。適應性機制對於新允入的用戶認為要
用最高 QoS規範 ibmax。 如果可用的頻寬資
源不足以滿足一個新允入用戶的頻寬需
求，為了滿足新允入用戶 QoS 的要求，分
配給現有用戶的頻寬資源將會減少。我們的
機制在這裡認為像最大最小機制，但是允入
的決策會透過效用函數來決，在此描述在
Fig. 4，透過使用 Eq. (1)、 (2)、 (3)以及(4)
來推倒，其參數描述在第三節 A 部分。假
設系統的容量 B 設為 100 Mbps。在所有三
個 CAC 機制演算法裡會採用一個固定頻寬
預留的機制[19]，對於被預期的換手連線，
在此會預留 20% 的系統頻寬，即 20 Mbps。
對於不同 CAC 機制演算法的效能會在新連
線的阻塞率(blocking rate)、換手連線的中斷
率 (dropping rate)以及聚集效用 (aggregate 
utility)的方案中各個比較。總模擬的週期為
1000秒，而模擬出的平均值是跑 20次。 
5. 1. 在不同 CAC機制中新連線的阻塞率以
及換手連線的中斷率 
Fig. 6 在不同的 CAC 機制中個別呈現
了新連線的阻塞率以及換手連線的中斷率。 
在適應性機制中呈現的阻塞率以及中斷率
為 0，這是所有機制中最低的，因為到達的
連線將始終. 和我們提出的機制相關的靜
態最大最小機制，在相同的到達率連線的情
況下，中斷率低於阻塞率，因為對於一個換
手連線，有確切的將會被預留頻寬。 舉例
來說，當到達率 λ 等於 0.6，靜態最大最小
機制和所提出的機制的阻塞率約為 62%，而
中斷率約為 41%。和靜態最大最小機制相
比，它呈現了我們機制提供了較低的換手中
斷率，但有稍高的新允入連線阻塞率，因為
所提議基於效用的方法，在換手連線時會有
較高的效用函數，因此優先權會比新允入連

制的 CAC 機制，它僅僅只考去頻寬的需求
作為允入的規範，並不能直接反映在用戶的
滿意度以及最佳效用函數的效能。在提供一
個最大的聚集效用方面，所提議的機制就做
得比其他兩種機制還來的好，尤其是當 λ 
大於 0.3的時候。特別是當到達率 λ 的範圍
從 0.4 到 0.9，相較於適應性機制以及靜態
最大最小機制來說，對於即時性服務以及非
即時性服務的換手連線之聚集效用平均約
個別提升 4.69%及 7.14% 。在效用方面，模
擬結果證明了 CAC 機制演算法可以有效地
改善資源的利用率以及增加用戶的滿意度。 
Fig. 8 個自呈現及時性以及非及時性
的效用函數，在每一種服務類型中還包含了
新允入連線以及換手連線。 它表明了在產
生效用方面中，兩種服務類型資源分配的效
益有很大的不同，尤其是當所分配的資源較
少的時候。 也就是說有較小的到達率 λ (請
注意，到達率連線和分配的資源量是呈比例
的)。 當 λ 等於 0.3時，即時性服務的效用
大約為 0.8，而非即時性服務高達 1.2 左
右。(請注意，Fig. 8a和 Fig. 8b 垂直軸的原
點是不同的)。這是因為即時性服務和非即
時性服務的特點不同，因此有不同的效用函
數。如 Fig. 4，即時性服務以及非即時性服
務的效用函數分別類似於一個布階函數和
凹面函數。由於即時性的效用函數有”硬式
QoS”的特性，用戶的語音封包會有明確的
資源數量以滿足具體的 QoS。相反地，非即
時性服務的用戶需要更多被提供的資源，所
以會有較高的用戶滿意度，但在有限資源的
範圍內仍然可以獲得一定的用戶滿意度。 
結果表明 CAC 機制應該要考慮效用，因為
有著相同資源的用戶可能會有不同的用戶
滿意度，而這些滿意度須各自遵循服務類型
的效用函數。 
從 Fig. 8 可以看出所提議的機制和其
他兩種機制相比，提供了較高的效用函數。
當 λ 從 0.4 變化到 0.9時， 我們提議的機
制和其他兩種機制相較，個別平均增加了 
2.46% 以及 11.13% 。 
最後 Fig. 9 呈現了所有服務類型的聚
集效用。它表明了當 λ 大於 0.3時，和適應
性以及靜態最大最小機制相比，我們所提議
的方案平均可提升約 5.32%。用所提議的
CAC機制，在每一個允入決策的時間點中，
資源將逐步地分配給有著最大效用函數的
用戶。最後結果證明了 CAC 機制在行動
Wimax環境中，能有效地提升用戶滿意度以
及最大化整體系統的效用。 
六、結論 
在本計畫中我們研究在 IEEE 802.16e
無線網路中使用賽局理論提出以使用效能
(utility)為基礎之資源分配演算法。對於即時
性服務以及非即時性服務的換手連線，我們
開發了其專用的效用函數。在 IEEE802.16e
行動WiMAX網路中，使用這些函數，我們
提出了一個新穎的基於效用 CAC 機制。我

Abstract—In this paper, we propose a simple and effective way to 
improve the uplink resource allocation for the extended-real-time 
polling service (ertPS) in IEEE 802.16e broadband wireless 
networks. Our proposed algorithm gathers statistics on the 
numbers of request header of medium access control layer (MAC) 
among various subscriber stations, and uses the information to 
enable a dynamic allocation of additional uplink resources to 
subscriber stations with continuously increasing demand upon 
the base stations. The simulation results show that in comparison 
with the original ertPS algorithm, the proposed uplink 
bandwidth allocation scheme is effective to improve the data 
throughput as well as to decrease the data packet loss rate.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In the recent years, the demands of broadband wireless 
accesses (BWA) are increasing due to the successful 
development of wireless multimedia services such as video 
conferencing, real-time multimedia streaming service, web TV 
and traditional Internet services. The IEEE802.16e network, 
the so-called mobile worldwide interoperability for microwave 
access (WiMAX) infrastructure, is a promising BWA solution 
which provides a high data transmission, an extensive scope of 
coverage, and high-speed mobility to support the quality of 
services (QoS) for multimedia applications. Since the 
characteristics of various multimedia applications have resulted 
in different issues such as heavy bandwidth demands and 
constrained time delays, how to effectively manage and 
allocate these limited IEEE802.16e wireless resources with 
respect to various QoS requirements has become an important 
current topic. 
In IEEE 802.16e standards [1], the media access control 
(MAC) layer defines five classes of scheduling services, which 
are unsolicited grant service (UGS), extended real-time polling 
service (ertPS), real-time polling service (rtPS), non-real-time 
polling service (nrtPS), and best effort (BE). In general, the 
UGS, ertPS and rtPS classes are classified for real-time traffic, 
while the nrtPS and BE classes are for non-real-time traffic. 
Each scheduling class is related to specific QoS parameters for 
quantifying its bandwidth requirement, e.g. minimum data rates, 
maximum packets delays, tolerable delay jitters, and so on. 
Based on the QoS requirements, the base station (BS) 
moderately allocates and schedules radio resources (i.e. time 
slots and frequency spectrums) among different types of traffic 
flows to provide differential QoS. However, the IEEE 802.16e 
standards do not clearly specify the resource allocation and 
scheduling mechanisms corresponding to the five service 
classes and remain that as open issues. 
Among the five scheduling classes, the ertPS was the latest 
one recommended, and adopted in the IEEE 802.16e standards. 
It is proposed by Lee et al. [2] to support real-time variable-bit-
rate (VBR) traffic and VoIP applications with silence 
suppression in particular. ertPS is developed by extending rtPS, 
while its characteristic is similar to that of both rtPS and UGS. 
On detecting the allocated bandwidth being either insufficient 
or excessive, the ertPS mechanism will send a request to 
change the amount of allocated bandwidth like rtPS does. 
Otherwise, if the bandwidth demand remains unchanged, ertPS 
behaves as UGS. Generally, the ertPS traffic reports at a higher 
priority compared with the rtPS and a lower priority than the 
UGS. 
The ertPS bandwidth request and allocation mechanism 
have been investigated in previous work [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 
[9]. In general, most of these work need to make additional 
modifications on the ertPS mechanism and introduce MAC 
overhead. In this paper we present a simple uplink bandwidth 
allocation algorithm for the ertPS mechanism. Our proposed 
algorithm allows the BS to actively allocate additional 
resources to subscriber stations (SS) which are with increasing 
demand or experiencing data loss caused by channel and 
movement, using information of statistics on the numbers of 
MAC bandwidth request (BR) header sent from SSs. The key 
idea of our resource allocation scheme is based on an 
observation that the statistics on the number of BR header in 
the ertPS mechanism provides information which indicates 
whether the demand on resources is satisfied within a certain 
observation period. A change in the number of BR header of 
respective SSs will, therefore, reflect historical information 
about its resource demand and can be exploited for our scheme 
to adaptively adjust the amount of bandwidth allocation for 
maintaining satisfactory QoS. 
We conduct simulations of 802.16e transmission scenarios 
to evaluate the performances of the proposed approach by 
comparison with the original ertPS algorithm. Simulations 
results illustrate that our approach can effectively improve the 
user-perceived QoS in terms of increasing data throughput and 
reducing packet loss rates over the ertPS algorithm.

A.  Proposed Context-based Uplink Bandwidth Allocation 
Algorithm 
To illustrate the proposed resource allocation algorithm, we 
have the definitions of system parameters as follows. Define 
)(nNireq  as the cumulative number of BR header successively 
sent by the ith SS till the nth polling cycle. Denore Nthr as the 
critical value for the number of consecutive BR header. bi(n) is 
defined as the default bandwidth volume granted for SS i in the 
nth polling cycle. The proposed resource allocation algorithm is 
described as follows. The BS records the statistic of BR header 
of each SS in every polling cycle. If BR header of SS i 
consecutively occur till the current cycle n, the BS gathers the 
cumulative number of consecutive BR header in the nth polling 
cycle, i.e.
 
)(nNireq , followed by a comparison of whether it 
exceeds Nthr to determine the actual amount of resource granted 
for SS i, )1( +′ nbi . If thrireq NnN     )( < , i.e. less than Nthr 
consecutive BR header occur till the nth cycle, the allocated 
bandwidth for SS i in the next transmission, i.e. the (n+1)th 
cycle, will remain unchanged as the default value bi(n+1). 
Otherwise, if thr
i
req NnN     )( ≥ , i.e. equal to or more than Nthr 
consecutive BR header occur till the nth cycle, it will increase 
the current amount by wi(n+1) for the subsequent transmission.

wi(n) is the additional amount of channel resources for SS i 
with increasing demands used to mitigate potential packet 
losses and service loads aggregated in succeeding transmission 
cycles. In general, determining the value of wi(n) should take 
into account the default allocation amount bi(n), the specific 
QoS parameters, current network loads, and so on. For the 
purpose of illustration, we consider the following example. 
Assume that a SS is with only one traffic flow. maxiR stands for 
the amount of channel resources which provides maximum 
sustained rate of SS i. nl(n) denotes the network load in the nth 
cycle. We have, 
).),(),(()( maxiii Rnnlnbfnw =
   
(2)
 )(⋅f  is defined as the weighted function of resources 
allocated to the SSs, which will affect whether the BS is able to 
allocate the proper amount wi(n) to SS i in need without 
causing an extra burden on the total network load. Besides, the 
determined amount of bandwidth allocation bi(n) + wi(n) 
should reflect on the QoS parameter maxiR , i.e. 
max)()( iii Rnwnb ≤+ . Thus wi(n) should be adjusted between 
zero and the maximum value, )(-max nbR ii  depending on the 
condition of network load, nl(n). Define a weighted factor α 
between [0, 1]. We can therefore determine the value of wi(n) 
as ))(-()( max nbRnw iii ⋅=α  by properly considering the value 
of α according the network load.  
We can consider several approaches to design the weighted 
function )(⋅f  with different setting of the weighted factor α. 
First a simple way, as shown in Fig. 2 (a), is to provide the 
maximum support or support nothing at all alternatively 
depending on the current network load nl regarding a threshold, 
γ. That is,

through the mechanism of BR header in the current polling 
period after the packet volume entering the system increased 
continuously for a few cycles. Reviewing our proposed 
algorithm, after a calculation of the number of requests 
)(nNireq  from respective SSs is conducted in the BS, we can 
observe from Fig. 3 that, more transmission resources are 
allocated corresponding to the period of a continuous increase 
in the number of packet arrivals. During the simulation period, 
our approach increased system packet processing capability 
from 4.13 to 14.10% by comparison with the primitive ertPS 
algorithm. 
B. Comparison of the packet loss rates with the primitive 
ertPS algorithm and the proposed algorithm 
Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the packet loss rates with the 
two algorithms. It is shown that our approach outperforms the 
primitive ertPS algorithm in terms of lower loss rates. The 
major reason for the primary ertPS algorithm with a higher 
packet loss rate was analyzed as follows. As the SS was unable 
to acquire sufficient resources for transmissions during a 
polling period, the data packets which should be transmitted 
immediately would be backlogged in the data queue. It will 
consequently lead to accumulated packet delays and cause 
packet losses due to a finite queue length in the next few 
transmission cycles. Our proposed algorithm enables timely 
acquisition of additional uplink resource by the SS when the 
data packet volume enters the system continuously, which 
reduces the packet waiting time in the queue, and decreases the 
incidence of declined packets. It is shown that the proposed 
approach provides a 19.8% improvement over the primitive 
ertPS. The results shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed context-based resource allocation 
algorithm to improve the performance of primitive ertPS 
mechanism in terms of higher data throughput and lower 
packet loss rates. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
Facing diverse multimedia streaming services in a wireless 
network, the question of how to achieve QoS requirements has 
been an urgent topic to date. In this paper, we propose a simple 
and effective way to improve the uplink resource allocation for 
the ertPS service in IEEE 802.16e broadband wireless 
networks. Our proposed algorithm gathers statistics on the 
numbers of MAC request header among various subscriber 
stations, and uses the information to enable a dynamic 
allocation of additional uplink resources to subscriber stations 
with continuously increasing demand upon the base stations. 
The simulation results show that in comparison with the 
original ertPS algorithm, our proposed approach is effective to 
improve data throughput as well as to decrease the data packet 
loss rate.

amounts of resources to meet specific QoS requirements
such as minimum throughput and delay boundary. This
fact implies that a CAC scheme should be developed
according to the application performance metric of ‘‘sat-
isfaction’’ rather than network performance metrics such as
‘‘throughput’’ or ‘‘fairness’’, and this is why we focus on
‘‘utility’’ for resource allocation throughout this paper.
The degree of user satisfaction with a given amount of
resource can be described by a utility function. Utility
functions are well developed mathematical models origi-
nally used in economics and have been widely used in
network researches such as Internet pricing and congestion
control [13, 14] in recent years. There have been numerous
researches based on utility functions of different objectives
for wireless networks [15–24]. Song and Li [15] presented
practical resource allocation algorithms based on a thor-
ough theoretical analysis to maximize the average utility of
active users in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) wireless networks. Cao and Li [17] proposed a
utility-based bandwidth allocation scheme which guaran-
tees the minimum utility of each user by adapting to the
dynamics of channel conditions and users’ requests. Jiang
et al. [22] analyzed the performance on the transmission
scenario of all users with best-effort traffic and presented
the scheduling algorithm which maximizes the total utility.
To satisfy users with different types of services, it is
essential to allocate resources to them based on specific
application-layer indicators, e.g. guaranteed minimum
quality or application-specific utility functions [25]. How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, very few utility-based
CAC schemes have been specifically proposed for IEEE
802.16e WMAN so far.
We are thus motivated to investigate the utility-based
CAC problem in IEEE 802.16e WMAN. In the design of
our utility-based CAC scheme, we further develop specific
utility functions for services in a handover process.
Handover occurs when mobile station (MS) transfers its
connection from the original serving BS with worse and
worse link qualities to a neighboring BS with better qual-
ities. In general, a handover user will be prioritized over a
new incoming user in order to provide better user-per-
ceived satisfaction especially when it is with real-time
applications which have specific QoS requirements, e.g.
throughput demands and delay/jitter constraints. Therefore,
the utility functions for a handover connection in general
should be different from a new connection. In this study we
develop feasible utility functions specific for a handover
connection. The numerical results show that our utility-
based CAC scheme can improve the overall utility in the
IEEE 802.16e mobile WiMAX network.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews
the related work. Section 3 introduces the QoS architecture
and handover mechanism in IEEE 802.16e WMANs. The
proposed utility-based CAC algorithm is presented in Sect.
4. Section 5 gives the performance evaluation of the pro-
posed scheme, and Sect. 6 draws collusions.
2 Related work
The CAC problems have been largely investigated in pre-
vious work [2, 3, 5–27]. The authors in [5, 6] propose to
adopt minimum bandwidth requirements as the admission
criteria for all classes of scheduling services. The approach
can provide more connections admitted into networks but
may cause a relatively low QoS performance. The authors
in [7] propose to divide the scheduling services into two
groups; one group consists of UGS, ertPS and rtPS adopting
maximum bandwidth requirements for the admission cri-
teria, while another group consists of nrtPS and BE adopt-
ing minimum bandwidth requirements. The approach may
over favor the higher-class services and cause a starvation
of lower-class services. Instead of using fixed criteria for an
admission control as described above, the studies in [2, 3]
propose to dynamically determine the admission criteria by
using a game-theoretic approach. However, it does not take
network loads into consideration and may introduce great
computational complexities.
Some other CAC schemes proposed in the literatures
[10–12] consider handover users in particular because it is
generally agreed that keeping an ongoing connection
unbroken is more important than admitting a new one.
Thus, these CAC schemes apply a bandwidth-reservation
mechanism to prioritize handover users over new-coming
users. In [10], the authors use a fixed guard channel scheme
to preserve a certain amount of bandwidth for probable
handover users to assure their QoS. When the total band-
width utilization of existing users reaches the threshold, no
more new connections can be admitted into the network.
Nevertheless, when a fixed amount of bandwidth can never
be used for new connections, a certain portion of network
resources may be wasted. The work [11] proposes to
dynamically adjust the quantity of reserved bandwidth
based on the arrival and departure behavior of handover
connections to make the resource utilization more efficient.
However, if handover connections occur infrequently, the
quantity of reserved bandwidth for handovers is almost
fixed and this approach would be similar to the fixed guard
channel scheme and cause a waste of network resources as
well. In [12], the authors consider the problems of CAC
and gateway relocations in the handover process jointly,
and propose a solution which triggers the gateway reloca-
tion at an appropriate time for handover users.
The CAC schemes proposed in [2, 3, 5–12] mainly
regard bandwidth demands, e.g. minimum and maximum
rate requirements, as the most important admission criteria

3.2 IEEE 802.16e handover mechanism
Mobility is one of the characteristics emphasized in the
IEEE 802.16e standard [1]. Handover occurs when a MS
transfers its connection from the original serving BS with
worse and worse link qualities to a neighboring BS with
better qualities. There are three different modes for hand-
over mechanism in the mobile WiMAX networks [28],
including hard handover (HHO), macro-diversity handover
(MDHO), and fast base station switching (FBSS). These
handover modes are triggered when the signal level
between the MS and serving BS is too weak. The HHO is
an obligatory handover mode, but MDHO and FBSS are
optional. In the HHO mode, the MS connects to only one
BS when transmitting. Once the MS performs handover, it
must break the link with the serving BS before establishing
communication with the target BS. The HHO mechanism is
easy to implement, but it can cause a temporary break of
wireless links and result in packet losses, which is unfa-
vorable for real-time services. The other two modes use the
diversity set, maintained in the MS, to achieve seamless
handover. The MS has to remain the list of the entire
neighbor BSs, and connect to each other with a least data
rate for status updating. The benefits of the diversity set
include a short handover delay and stable transmission, but
the handover procedure and special configuration become
substantially more complicated. Figure 2 illustrates sce-
narios for these modes. In this study we consider HHO as
the handover mode to analyze system performance.
4 Proposed utility-based CAC scheme
4.1 Utility function
Utility functions depict the degree of user satisfaction on
services with a given amount of resources. Users may have
different degrees of satisfaction with the same resource,
guided by the respective utility function of the traffic. In
particular, the utility functions for real-time and non-real-
time services can be quite different. For instance, the
authors in [29] represent the utility functions for video
streaming services, Ur(b) and that for best-effort services,
Unr(b) with a given amount of channel resources b as:
UrðbÞ ¼ 1
1 þ fd  exp½2b  lnðdÞ=Bmaxg ð1Þ
UnrðbÞ ¼ logðb=BminÞ
logðBmax=BminÞ ; ð2Þ
where Bmin and Bmax stand for the minimum and maxi-
mum amounts of supported resources respectively; d = 1/
dm - 1, where dm is the minimum utility with Bmin been
supported. Figure 3 shows utility curves using dm = 0.001,
Bmax = 10 Mbps, and Bmin = 100 or 700 Kbps for best-
effort or video streaming traffic respectively. It is shown
that the utility functions of real-time and non-real-time
services approximate to a unit-step function and a concave
function, respectively, with respect to the allocated band-
width, as depicted in Fig. 3.
In particular, the utility functions for a handover con-
nection should be different from that for a new connection
with the same services. The main reason is that a handover
connection generally would be prioritized over a new
connection in order to provide better user-perceived satis-
faction, which is somewhat analogous to the differential
priorities between real-time and best-effort services. Con-
sider a scenario as follows for example. Assume that there
is one new connection and one handover connection which
are with the same traffic type, e.g. IPTV traffic and
simultaneously request resources for transmissions. If the
resource available is only adequate to support one traffic
flow, the BS must determine which one can be admitted in
the network. It is apparent that tearing an on-going con-
nection down will cause a worse experience for users than
blocking a new connection. In other words, from the per-
spective of the BS, the same resources granted for a

process returns back to Step (1).
4.3 Design and implementation of the proposed CAC
algorithm
The design and implementation of the proposed utility-
based CAC scheme in practice can involve the overheads
as follows.
(1) The set-up of utility functions: In the initial phase of
network built-up, the BS has to maintain the specific
utility functions corresponding to the considered four
types of traffic flows which are real-time new
connection, non-real-time new connection, real-time
handover connection, and non-real-time handover
connection, respectively, like those shown in Eqs. (1),
(2), (3), and (4). The adopted values of the system
parameters such as dm, Bmin, Bmax, and a and the

highest QoS criteria bmax
i for a new coming user. If the
resources available are insufficient to meet the bandwidth
requirement of a new connection, the bandwidth allocated
to existing users will be decreased to satisfy the QoS
requirement of the new connection. Our scheme here
considers the criteria as that of the Static-Min-Max scheme,
but it makes admission decision based on the utility func-
tions derived from Eqs. (1), (2), (3), and (4) using the
parameters aforementioned in Sect. 4.1. The system
capacity B is set as 100 Mbps. A fixed bandwidth reser-
vation scheme [11] is adopted for all the three CAC
algorithms, which reserves a 20 % of system resources
(20 Mbps) for expected handover connections. The per-
formances for different CAC schemes are compared in
terms of the new-connection blocking rate, handover-con-
nection dropping rate as well as the aggregate utility i.e.
summation of the utility of individual traffic flows. The
total simulation period is 200 s while the results are pro-
vided with the average values over 10 times of simulations.
5.1 Comparison of new-connection blocking rate
and handover-connection dropping rate
Figure 6 shows the new-connection blocking rate and
handover-connection dropping rate respectively with dif-
ferent CAC schemes. It is shown that with the Adapt
scheme, the blocking rate and dropping rate is 0 steadily,
which is the lowest among all schemes since the arriving
connections will always be admitted into the network
regardless of the amount of bandwidth available. With both
the Static-Min-Max scheme and our proposed scheme, the
dropping rate is always lower than the blocking rate with a
given connection arrival rate because of a certain amount
of bandwidth reserved for handover connections. For
example, when the arrival rate k is equal to 0.5 in partic-
ular, the blocking rate with Static-Min-Max and the pro-
posed scheme is about 56 %, while the dropping rate is
about 32 %. It is shown that in comparison with the Static-
Min-Max scheme, our scheme provides a lower handover
dropping rate but a slightly higher new-connection block-
ing rate since the proposed utility-based approach essen-
tially will prioritize a handover connection which conducts
to a higher utility. In average our proposed scheme can
admit more connections by 8.03 % over the Static-Min-
Max scheme.
5.2 Aggregate utility of handover connections
with different CAC schemes
Figure 7 presents the aggregate utility of handover con-
nections with non-real-time and real-time services, respec-
tively. It is shown that the aggregate utility arises with the
increase of connection arrival rates because of growing
utilization efficiently of network resources. The Adapt and
Static-Min-Max schemes have similar performances of
utility in spite of their completely different blocking rate
and dropping rate as shown in Fig. 6. We can observe that
although the Adapt scheme provides the lowest blocking
rate and dropping rate which grants the greatest amount of
connections as shown in Fig. 6, it does not provide a better
utility performance than the other two schemes because it
will take away the bandwidth resources of existing con-
nections to satisfy new admitted connections. It is shown
that a CAC scheme like Adapt or Static-Min-Max which
considers only the bandwidth requirement as the admission
criterion cannot directly reflect on the user satisfaction to
optimize the utility performance. The proposed scheme

The results demonstrate that the proposed CAC algorithm
can efficiently improve the network utilization and increase
the user satisfaction in terms of utility.
5.3 Aggregate utility of non-real-time and real-time
traffic separately and collectively
Figure 8 presents the aggregate utility of non-real-time and
real-time services, respectively, with each type of services
comprising both new and handover connections. It is
shown from Fig. 8 that the proposed scheme provides
higher utilities than the other two schemes for both real-
time and non-real-time connections. It is also shown that
the performance difference between the proposed scheme
and the other two schemes for real-time services is much
larger than that for non-real-time services especially when
the arrival rate k is large (note that the amount of allocated
resources are generally proportion to the connection arrival
rate). When k is larger than 0.5, the utility improvement
with the proposed scheme over the other two schemes for
non-real-time services is about 4.15 %, while that for real-
time services is as large as 11.63 %. This is because of the
different characteristics of real-time and non-real-time
services and therefore the dissimilar behaviors of their
respective utility functions. As shown in Fig. 4, the utility
functions of real-time and non-real-time services are sim-
ilar to a unit-step function and a concave function,
respectively. Due to the ‘‘hard QoS’’ property of real-time
utility function, users call for explicit amounts of resources
to meet specific QoS. On the other hand, users of non-real-
time services experience a higher degree of satisfaction
with more resources provided, but still can obtain certain
satisfaction with limited resources. Thus users with dif-
ferent kinds of services may experience rather different
degrees of satisfaction with the same amount of network
resources, guided by the specific utility function of the
traffic. When the traffic intensity becomes large, the pro-
posed algorithm will tend to choose a connection which
conducts to higher utilities, i.e. a real-time connection.
When k is larger than 0.2, our proposed scheme averagely
can increase the aggregate utility by 4.18 and 10.22 % in
comparison with other two schemes for non-real-time and
real-time connections respectively. The results demonstrate
that the proposed CAC scheme which makes admission
decisions based on utility functions can optimize the effi-
ciency of network resources according to various service
types and traffic loads.
Figure 9 shows the aggregate utility of all the four types
of traffic. It is shown that our proposed scheme averagely
can increase the aggregate utility by about 6.93 % over the
