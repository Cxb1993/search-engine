In Masmoudi and Bouhlel’s scheme [5], the bit-stream of a certain resolution
image is hashed and appended as AC. The new extracted AC and the appended AC is
compared to determine image authentication. In Steinder et al.’s scheme, the 
wavelet-based and network-conscious concepts are incorporated to develop a blind
digital image signature technique [6]. Each multi-resolution image can be
authenticated in real time. In Huang et al.’s watermarking, the genetic algorithm is
applied to DCT domain and JPEG spectral selection mode [7]. In Amiri et al.’s 
watermarking, discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) sub-bands of watermark are
embedded into the corresponding DWT sub-bands [8].
In this paper, a multi-resolution images authenticator with a high precision is
proposed. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the proposed
scheme is introduced. The experimental results are shown in Section 3. Finally,
conclusions are given in Section 4.
2. The propose scheme
The proposed scheme extracts the most important image information to take as
the AC. The AC is then progressively embedded and extracted to authenticate the
multi-resolution images. The authentication code generation, embedding and
authentication procedures are involved in this scheme.
2.1. The authentication code generation
To develop an image authenticator, AC is first considered. In the proposed scheme,
AC is extracted from the image content which contains the feature to authenticate the
multi-resolution images. In addition, AC can be embedded into multi-resolution
images. So, the size of the AC should be considered carefully.
On the above considerations, we observed that DWT decomposed the image into
multi-levels. The coefficients in different levels hold the tree structure characteristics
in which the root nodes preserve the most important energy. So, LL coefficients are
selected as the AC.
To embed AC in image with imperceptibility, AC is further scaled. Finally,
scaled AC is rearranged into bit planes. The first MSB of each LL coefficient is first
embedded and extracted. And then, the second and the third MSB bit planes can be
embedded/extracted, respectively. From that, AC can be embedded according to their
importance.
An example shown in Table 1 illustrates the proposed AC generation. The scaled
AC also indicates to rough coefficient magnitude. For example, the AC valued at 7
shown in Table 1(b) implies the corresponding coefficient magnitude is greater than
- 4 -
To verify multi-resolution image integrity, the embedded AC will be extracted from
the low resolution images.
To authenticate the reconstructed multi-resolution images, the first embedded
AC bit plane is extracted from HH coefficients. The embedding bit, which is the same
as that of in embedding procedure, is extracted. If the second AC bit plane is not
available, only the first AC bit plane is employed to verify the current reconstructed
image. The first authentication bit plane implies the estimated coefficient magnitude
(est_mag). Therefore, the LL coefficient magnitude in current reconstructed image is
compared with est_mag. For example, the extracted AC bit value of 1 indicates that
the est_mag is greater than or equal to 128 and bit value of 0 indicates the est_mag is
less than 128. If the comparison result matches, the current reconstructed image is
authenticated. The authentication of the first authentication bit can be formulated as in
equation (1).

bitAC (1)
Once the current reconstructed low resolution image is authenticated, detailed
image information is received to refine the rough image. When the second AC bit
plane is received, the second AC bit plane can be extracted to verify the refined
images. Similarly, the embedding bit in HL coefficient is examined to extract the
embedded AC bit. Now, the AC is composed of the first and the second AC bit planes.
This AC bits indicated est_mag will be more precise. For example, two AC bits
valued at 3 (11)2 indicates the est_mag is greater than or equal to 192, bits value of 2
indicates the est_mag is greater than or equal to 128 and less than 192. The coefficient
comparison between the currently reconstructed coefficient and the est_mag
authenticates the currently reconstructed image. The authentication of the first and the
second AC bit planes can be formulated as in equation (2).

If further refine image information is received, the third AC bit plane can be
extracted from LH sub-band. Now, all of AC is available and a more precision
est_mag is indicated. The comparison result determines whether the multi-resolution
image is authenticated or not. Since the reconstructed images can be authenticated
from low resolution to high resolution, the significant tampering will be detected in
low resolution authentication procedure and slight modification will be located in
high resolution authentication procedure.

the same result in which text “F-16” with diferent contrasts was inserted into three 
locations and the number 8 in airplane number was removed in Figure 3(a). The
tampered areas were detected progressively according to their significance.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, a watermarking for multi-resolution images authentication is
presented. The size of the AC can be determined according to the embedding
distortion and the authentication precision. The experimental results show that the
reconstructed low and high resolution images can be authenticated according to the
extracted AC bits. Furthermore, the significant tampered areas can be detected and
located in low resolution images and slight tampered can be located from high
resolution images.

計畫成果自評：
從本計畫的研究成果內容顯示，預期的計畫目標已獲得達成，在多解析度的
影像傳輸架構下，接收者可快速地重建出影像重要結構，接著，再逐步增加影像
的解析度而重建出更精緻的影像。在這個過程中，若接收者所接收的低解析度影
像已能滿足他的需求時，資訊而的傳送就此中斷，此時所重建的影像尚未完整，
但也必須確保其傳輸過程的安全性。本計畫所發展的方法能夠驗證未完整重建的
影像，已達到本計畫之預期的目標，此一研究成果已有一篇國際研討會論文和一
篇期刊論文發表，國際研討會論文在International Conference on computer
information security and assurance (ISA 2012) pp.119-121, 2012 研討會中發表，期
刊論文發表於International Journal of Information Security & Its Applications, Vol.
6 No.2 pp. 161-166, 2012。未來將做進一步的探討，相信非常具有實務應用的價
值。
