    單相或多相連續體模型可用來描述土石流及泥漿流之流動。這些連續體模型雖然各自具
有不同的本構理論，且應用到重力驅動簡單剪切流會得到相同的結果，但對複雜流動問題其
結果可能會大不相同。為了解此問題，我們將會分析若干常見之非線性土石流本構方程式模
型，以了解彼此之間的差異性。在薄層假設（Shallowness assumption）之架構下，我們將利
用這些不同之模型來模擬土石流由流道進入空曠區所形成之扇形流動與堆積問題；比較不同
的模型所得到的數值結果，並與實驗量測之結果相較，可得到這些不同模型在描述土石流等
自然災害時其適用性以及限制性。

貳、報告內容 
(一) 前言及研究目的 
 
    A debris flow represents the gravity-driven flow of a cohesionless sand or a mixture of various 
sizes of sediment (from clay to boulders), water and air, down a steep slope, often initiated by 
heavy rainfall and/or landslides. The volume solids concentration in the front part of such a flow 
varies between about 30 and 65％, and generally decreases towards the rear. The flow depth is of 
the order of 1 to several meters, mean velocities may be as high as 15m/s, and channel gradients 
vary from about 40 in the starting zone to about 3 in the deposition zone.     
    Physically, debris flows can be regarded as flows of a large amount of discrete solid particles 
with interstices filled with a fluid and/or a gas. They are essentially multi-phase and 
multi-constituent, and their behaviour are the averaged responses of the interactions between 
particles-particles and particles-fluids. Methods employed to investigate debris flows can be 
classified into three different classes: (i) the approach of molecular dynamics/event driven 
dynamics/discrete element dynamics, (ii) the approach of statistical mechanics/kinetic theory and 
(iii) the approach of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics. In the context of continuum and 
thermodynamic approach, debris flows are modeled as one-phase or multi-phase continua 
exhibiting microstructural effects at their macroscale. The balance equations of one-phase debris 
flow models can thus be given by

where  is the density, v the velocity, t the Cauchy stress tensor, b the specific body force, tT the

known as the stretching tensor, q the heat flux, r the specific energy supply,  the specific entropy,

quantity). The notation   denotes the material time derivative of , e.g. v )grad(t / , 
while AB = tr(ABT) = tr(ATB) for two arbitrary second-rank tensors. In the formulations (1)-(5), 
debris flows are not considered micropolar or Cosserat type, so that the balance of angular 
momentum reduces to the symmetry of the Cauchy stress tensor. Depending on the complexity of 
the model, additional variables (e.g. the volume fraction  defined as the solid volume divided by 
the total volume of a representative volume element) are introduced to account for the specific 
microstructural effects, and are associated with additional equations for their evolutions. The

    Takahashi’s (1991) IAHR monograph summarizes the work as of that time; it gives a fairly 
critical account on the mechanisms of debris flows from their onset to deposition. It presents a 
detailed understanding of the mechanisms of the flow of a layer of a particle-fluid mixture under 
simple gravity driven shear for Bagnold’s (1954) grain inertia and macroviscous regimes. The model 
equations are eventually simplified to essentially a one-constituent model, and this view is 
maintained throughout. What emerges is a hydraulic model resembling Bagnold-type constitutive 
behaviour of the stresses. Two-dimensional flows are analyzed, time dependent and steady, and 
the snout behaviour. Cheng-Liung Chen (1987) works in a similar spirit. Based on his own work and 
on work by Jan & Chen (1993), Hungr (1994), Coussot (1994), O’Brian et al. (1993) and on Laigle & 
Coussot (1993), Chen presents a detailed analysis of the rheological models and deduces with 
these the velocity profiles for steady gravity driven flow of strictly parallel sided slab.    
    Other continuous models have been derived in the avalanche research community. They are 
based on nonlinear visco-plastic assumptions. Coulomb response or higher grade viscous 
behaviour. Mention might be made of the Voellmy-Salm model (Voellmy 1955, Salm 1968), the 
Bingham model (Liu & Mei 1994) and the Criminale-Ericksen fluid (Norm et al. 1987), which all are 
also only analyzed in plane hydraulic flow situations. For details see Salm & Gubler (1987).      
    Somewhat hidden in these existing formulations of the rheological behaviour of debris flows 
is the fact that these relations cannot be extended to a three-dimensional form of the constitutive 
relations. In other words, two sets of general constitutive relations can in plane simple shear be 
indistinguishable. In descriptions of the dispersion of a channelised flow into a fan – this often 
occurs in practices – this may be important. Furthermore, until the 90ies of the last century debris 
flow specialists also generally abstained from introducing variables and associated field equations 
for the internal or micro-structure, say the volume fraction of the solids (or the porosity), the 
fluctuation of the velocity and particle concentration fields due to grain collisions and/or possible 
turbulence in the interstitial fluid flow.  
(1) In the granular flow literature advancement has been achieved by postulating a 
constitutive relation for the Cauchy stress tensor of the form t = f(, grad, D), where D = 
sym(grad v),  is the solid volume fraction and f is of the Reiner-Rivilin type. Such propositions 
are by McTigue (1978) and Savage (1979), whilst Jenkins & Cowin (1979) postulate a higher 
rate law involving the second Rivlin-Ericksen tensor, but all threelaws predict the same 
behaviour under static plane shear flow. On the other hand, Rajagopal & Massoudi (1990) 
postulate the Cauchy stress to depend linearly on D and the “structure tensor M = grad  
grad” with coefficients that depend nonlinearly upon the solid volume fraction. Massoudi 
and Boyle (1991) demonstrate that this stress can also be derived from Enskog’s dense gas 
procedure, when treating the fluctuation of the granules with an approach of statistical 
mechanics. No examples of simple flows have so far been treated to our knowledge let alone 
the flow under somewhat realistic driving conditions. Furthermore, because of the higher
