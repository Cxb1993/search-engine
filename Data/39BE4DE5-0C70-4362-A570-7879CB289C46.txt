1. Introduction 
In the past few years, low voltage and low power designs have attracted significant attentions because 
of the popularity of portable devices. Emerging embedded biomedical applications have once more pushed the 
low-power designs into another extreme case. Scaling the supply voltage down below the threshold voltage is 
the most favorable solution for low-power designs. A 180mV, 1024-point FFT processor is a pioneer 
subthreshold-supply design. Subthreshold SRAM is another important category. Other designs include a 6-bit 
Flash ADC for use at 0.2–0.9V and a 14-tap 8-bit finite impulse response (FIR) at 20MHz under 0.27V. 
As technology continues to be scaled down, the on-chip global interconnect in the SoC design becomes 
a bottleneck with regard to speed, power and cost. The repeater insertion represents a feasible technique for 
the trade-off among speed, power and cost requirements.  
Subthreshold circuit design is challenging because the driving capability (Ion), the Ion/Ioff ratio, and 
process variations are degraded significantly, affecting the circuit performance, the power efficiency (leakage 
power), and the fabrication yield. First of all, although circuits down to the sub-threshold-supply can achieve 
ultra-low power consumption, the driving capability of CMOS devices in sub-threshold region remains 
challenging. Then, while requiring a large area to compensate for driving efficiency in sub-threshold power 
supply, a conventional CMOS tapered buffer also incurs a severe Ioff problem in the nano meter process. In 
addition, subthreshold circuits suffer serious process variations, which could be even several times variations. 
Unfortunately, in the subthreshold region, conventional CMOS repeaters still suffer from the severe 
design problems mentioned above. Bootstrapping is an effective means of enhancing the speed in order to 
raise the driving efficiency. Therefore, a previous work has developed a bootstrapped CMOS driver for large 
capacitive loads. According to Lou (JSSC 1997), the bootstrapped driver consists of a pull-up and pull-down 
control pair to drive the PMOS and NMOS transistors, respectively. In Lou’s and Kuo’s design, the gate 
voltages of PMOS and NMOS driver transistors are kept VDD and 0 in the cut-off phase. In the driving phase, 
the gate voltages of PMOS and NMOS transistors are fed -VDD and 2VDD to increase the current density. 
Several researchers have proposed some improvements based on the architecture in Fig. 1(a). Despite a 
previous effort to increase the boosting efficiency by rearranging the timing of the switching and boosting 
signals, reverse leakage current remains the main drawback of conventional bootstrapped drivers.  
This project proposes two bootstrap circuits, an active leakage-current-reduction bootstrapped inverter 
(ALBI) and an ISI-suppressed bootstrapped driver (ISBD). The ALBI is applicable in both increasing driving 
ability by boosting signals into super-threshold region and reducing the leakage current in sub-threshold 
region. The ISBD is designed to suppress ISI noise in data link applications, and improve the precharge and 
leakage current reduction schemes as well. The Ion/Ioff ratio enhancement is also adopted in these two circuits. 
Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) scheme is an efficient power saving method 
according to the relationship among power consumptions, supply voltage and operating frequency. DVFS 
scheme is applied to adjust PVT variation as well. As designer of view, simulation results should fit all kinds 
of PVT corners. In fact, such designs often remain large redundant margin in particle chip. DVFS can adjust 
the supply voltage or the frequency for the task appropriately and dynamically and therefore exceeds most 
efficient power saving. In the proposed DVFS system, supply voltage or the data rate can be dynamically

2. Background Review 
Bootstrapped Drivers 
 Bootstrapped Drivers (JSSC 1997) 
According to Lou’s the bootstrapped driver (JSSC 1997), which consists of a pull-up and pull-down 
control pair to drive the PMOS and NMOS transistors, respectively. In Lou’s and Kuo’s design as shown in 
Fig. 2-1, the gate voltages of PMOS and NMOS driver transistors are kept VDD and 0 in the cut-off phase. In 
the driving phase, the gate voltages of PMOS and NMOS transistors are fed -VDD and 2VDD to increase the 
current density. However, in the ultra-low voltage design, this circuit consist some drawbacks. First of all, due 
to the poor current capability, the precharge current from MN1 and MP1 restrict the speed of precharge time. 
Next, MN1 and MP1 incur reverse current at the boosting mode. The reverse current discharge bootstrap caps at 
the boosting nodes and flow charges back to the supply. Although the reverse current doesn’t consume power, 
more precharge time is needed. Moreover, the Ion/Ioff ratio is serious in the low-voltage design. The low Ion/Ioff 
ratio will induce more leakage power. 
 
Fig. 2-1. Bootstrapped driver reported in JSSC 1997 
 Bootstrapped Drivers (T. VLSI 2008) 
Kil et al. (2008) proposed a precharge enhancement scheme to accelerate the bootstrapped circuit 
operations in a 6MHz distributed clock network at 0.4V, as shown in Fig 2-2. That scheme also feeds back the 
output boosting signal to effectively suppress the reverse leakage current and maintain the output boosting 
voltage level. However, extra capacitors increase the hardware cost by two folds. However, this approach is 
not suitable for use in a data link due to the kick-back disturbance through the boosting capacitors degrades 
rapidly at a high frequency and causes a large timing jitter. Additionally, static power in this design 
encounters a serious problem since it accounts for most of the power consumption. Among other bootstrapped 
circuits, single capacitor ones reduce the costs of hardware overhead. However, their complex circuitry design 
seriously degrades charge sharing at the capacitor node. Moreover, the leakage current is problematic as well.

 VCO Using Bulk-Driven Technique (TCASII 2009) 
One important solution to the threshold voltage limitation is the bulk-driven technique. It is a typical 
technique to the operational amplifier design in low-voltage. The bulk-driven MOSFET allows zero, negative, 
and even small positive bias voltage to achieve the desired DC current. It also extends the input 
common-mode range which is difficult to achieve at low supply voltage. Typically, the bulk terminals of 
MOSFETs are always connected to the highest (or lowest) voltage in the circuit for PMOS (or NMOS) 
transistors to avoid the latch-up problem. In a 0.5-V design, no risk of forward biasing of this junction exists. 
The bulk terminal can be used with a rail-to-rail input. 
 
Fig. 2-4. Comparison between gate- and bulk- driven. 
Fig. 2-4 shows the characteristics of the gate- and bulk-driven PMOS transistors. In the gate-driven 
PMOS without forward body biasing (FBB), the source-to-gate voltage must be greater than the absolute 
value of the threshold voltage while in the bulk-driven technique, it can eliminate the above limitation.

Fig. 2-8. Fine tuning stage. 
Fig. 2-6 illustrates the architecture of an ultra-low-power DCO in 2007. The main idea is to change the 
oscillation frequency by means of modifying the delay time of the signal path. To preserve the control code 
resolution and the operation range, the DCO employs a cascade structure consisting of coarse-tuning and 
fine-tuning stages. Therefore, the control code-to-delay linearity and operating range can be achieved easily. 
Two low-power techniques are obtained. First, the segmental delay line (SDL) can disable the transition of 
redundant segmental delay cells in coarse-tuning stage, as shown in Fig. 2-7. Second, the hysteresis delay cell 
(HDC) is proposed for the fine tuning stage to reduce the number of short-delay cells. The fine tuning stage is 
shown in Fig. 2-8 which has three sub-fine-tune stages. It is composed of a HDC, a long-delay 
digitally-controlled varactor (DCV), and a short-delay DCV. In addition, it should be noted that the 
controllable range in each stage must be larger than the delay step of the previous stage. So the cascade DCO 
structure doesn’t have any dead zone larger than the LSB resolution of the DCO. 
 Low Jitter ADPLL (2009) 
In ADPLLs, digital loop filters replace analog loop filters to reduce the area overhead. But an extra adder 
is required to sum up the proportional and the integral parts of the digital loop filter. As shown in Fig. 2-9, 
with a mixed-signal PFD, the extra adder is no more needed and the longest transport delay is reduced. In 
addition, the PFD has a shorter switching time. It is proportional to the phase error. So it has better jitter 
performance than the bang-bang PFD. As for the DCO, higher frequency resolution of DCO can decrease the 
output jitter. Thus, a DCO resolution enhancement circuit is applied to achieve the low jitter requirement.

3. Proposed On-chip Bus  
Proposed on-chip bus 
Fig. 3-1 shows the proposed 4-bit on-chip bus for data communication under the subthreshold power 
supply. A bus is divided into several segments, each of which is driven by a bootstrapped repeater. Ground 
shielding is used to eliminate the effective-loading uncertainty and decouple noise from adjacent channels. 
The staggered repeaters on adjacent channels are misaligned to reduce the coupling noise and simultaneous 
switching noise (SSN).

Proposed bootstrapped drivers 
This project proposes two bootstrap circuits, an active leakage-current-reduction bootstrapped inverter 
(ALBI) and an ISI-suppressed bootstrapped driver (ISBD). We will introduce in following section. 
 ALBI 
Figure 3-2 schematically depicts the proposed bootstrapped CMOS inverter. Where CBP and CBN are the 
bootstrap capacitors; MP1 and MN1 are the transistors for CBP precharge and CBN pre-discharge; INV refers to 
the inverter to control MP2 and MN2; MPD and MND are the output drivers for CL; NP and NN are the boosted 
nodes. The node NB is boosted above VDD and below ground to enhance the driving capability. 
Figure 3-3 shows the simulated transient waveforms with an output load of 0.5pF under a power supply 
of 200 mV. According to this figure, before Vin transits from H-to-L, node NN has the initial voltage of 0 V. 
After transiting from H-to-L, NN is boosted below ground to (-188 mV). Meanwhile, MP2 is turned off and 
MN2 is turned on. Therefore, the boosted signal at NN passes through MN1 to NB to drive MPD in order to pull 
up the capacitive load CL. At this moment, MP1 is turned on to precharge NP to VDD (0.2 V). However, MN1 is 
turned on reversely causing the reverse current flow to charge NN. At the end of the period while Vin is L, NN 
still holds (-90 mV). When Vin goes from L to H, the operation is similar to Vin transiting from H to L. NP is

Where kf is a fitting parameter. However, circuit delay time is related to the RC loading effects. The proposed 
bootstrapped inverter has the shortest delay time among the other bootstrapped circuits since the loading of 
INV is only gate capacitance of MN2 and MP2.  
Fig. 3-4 summarizes the comparison results for the delay time (from H to L) and the power 
consumption as a function of CL at 10MHz with a supply of 200 mV. The proposed design is the lowest in 
power consumption and delay time.

 ISBD 
The proposed bootstrapped repeater is composed of an inverter as the driver and a bootstrap control 
circuit. The bootstrap control circuit has many important features. First, a precharge enhancement scheme 
improves the precharge capability to achieve high-speed operation. Second, a leakage current elimination 
technique suppresses the ISI noise. Third, the bootstrap control circuit produces a boosted output swing 
from –VDD to 2VDD to increase the driving current (2VDD) and turn off the transistor aggressively (–VDD). As a 
result, the Ion/Ioff ratio is improved substantially. 
Fig. 3-5 depicts the proposed bootstrapped CMOS repeater. CBP and CBN are the bootstrap capacitors; 
MP1 and MN1 are the precharge transistors for CBP and CBN; INVP and INVN are the pre-drivers to boost CBP 
and CBN; and MPD and MND are the output drivers. NBT is boosted to 2VDD and –VDD to enhance the driving 
capability of MPD and MND. NBT is also fed back to control MP1 and MN1 to enhance the precharge capacity 
and eliminate the reverse leakage current simultaneously.

Where µ  is the effective mobility; Cdep is the depletion capacitance; W and L are the width and length of the 
device; VT is the thermal voltage; VGS is the gate-to-source voltage; Vth is the threshold voltage; n is the 
sub-threshold slope factor, and VDS is the drain-to-source voltage. Scaling down to a sub-threshold supply 
voltage substantially reduces Ion, which is proportional to (VGS – Vth) and varies exponentially with VDS. Since 
Ioff also remains exponentially proportional to VDS, Ioff becomes responsible for a significant fraction of the 
total power consumption. As a result, scaling the supply voltage below the subthreshold directly lowers the 
Ion/Ioff ratio.  
Although HSPICE can simulate steady-state leakage power, characterizing the leakage power under 
dynamic operations is difficult. The following approach is taken. The total energy per bit is represented as 
T SW SC LeakageE E E E= + + . (3-4) 
Where TE  represents the total energy per bit; SWE  is the switching energy; SCE  is the short-circuit energy, 
and LeakageE  is the leakage energy. Here, SWE  and SCE  are independent of the period because they are 
consumed only when an H-to-L or an L-to-H transition occurs. However, LeakageE is proportional to T and can 
be represented as .Leakage LeakageE P T= ⋅  Thus, (3-6) can be rewritten as 
T SW SC LeakageE E E P T= + + ⋅ . (3-5)

To demonstrate the reduction of leakage current, the proposed design is compared with the conventional 
inverter and two reported works [16-17]. They are all designed to drive a 200fF CL. A 55nm SPRVT process 
is used. For all bootstrap drivers, CB = 50fF and the widths of MPD and MND are 288nm and 108nm, 
respectively, for a fair comparison. The conventional inverter was designed to be 50 times the size of the 
bootstrapped driver to obtain the same output trise and tfall as the bootstrapped one.  
Fig. 3-7 shows the PLeakage/PT ratio as function of the supply voltage. The proposed design has a 
PLeakage/PT ratio of less than 1% even though VDD = 0.1V. It is roughly one order of magnitude lower than 
those of the others.

4. DVFS scheme with a low-voltage multi-phase ADPLL 
Proposed DVFS scheme 
In order to achieve the highest power efficiency of on-chip bus, a new DVFS for on-chip bus scheme is 
proposed. In our proposed DVFS scheme, supply voltage or the data rate can be dynamically changed according 
to the practical PVT corners and noise condition by the measured timing margin; therefore the power 
consumption can be optimized to meet the specification requirements of the on-chip bus. However, timing 
margin is related to timing jitter. Timing jitter is due to the phase variation of a periodic signal in data 
communications and telecommunications; for instance, the maximum jitter is specified 0.7UI in the 
PCI-Express standard at the receiver end. Receiver can’t recover the data if the timing jitter is larger than 0.7UI. 
Timing jitter may be quite different in variable PVT conditions. However, the goal of our proposed DVFS 
scheme is to change supply voltage or the data rate to make timing margin just fit the timing specification 
whatever the corner of the practical IC is. If there is too much redundant margin, we can lower down supply 
voltage to save power dissipation according the results of DVFS. On the other hand, if there is not enough 
timing margin, we can increase supply voltage to speed up the circuits or slow down the operating frequency. 
Consequently malfunctions can be prevented from dynamical tuning. 
In order to measure the timing jitter on chip, the transitions monitoring scheme which can detect data 
transitional edge is shown in Figure 4-1. DIN represents input data and CK is multi-phase clock. The concept of 
data transitional edge detection is that when the adjacent sample phases get the different value from sampling 
data, data transition occurs. After many times of sampling from multi-phases, data transitions form 
peak-to-peak timing jitter which are represented by sampling phases. Furthermore, we can construct the region 
of jitter of whole eye-diagram by the results of timing measurement. On the other hand, results of timing 
measurement can also be represented by how much eye-diagram opening according to unit interval of data rate, 
which is shown in Figure 4-1(b).

Bootstrapped ring oscillator (BTRO) 
In recent years, low-voltage supply is essential in minimizing the energy consumption for battery and 
solar-powered electronics systems. However, the design of CMOS circuits under low-voltage supply in 
subthreshold region is challenging. Weak driving capability and large process variation are two major 
concerns. 
Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are key building blocks in integrated circuits. In which, voltage controlled

Fig. 4-3. Schematic diagram of the proposed bootstrapped CMOS delay cell. 
Fig. 4-3 depicts the proposed bootstrapped CMOS delay cell schematically. It consists of a bootstrap 
circuit and a driver. The bootstrap circuit includes INVP and INVN for the bootstrap control, CBP and CBN as 
the bootstrap capacitors, and MP1 and MN1 as the precharging transistors. Vin and Vout are the boosted input 
and output nodes with MP2 and MN2 as the driver. Besides, Vout is fed back to the gate of the MP1 and MN1 to 
enhance the precharge ability and also eliminate the reverse current to keep the charges on the bootstrap 
capacitors. The charges on the bootstrap capacitors dominate the boost efficiency which affects the driving 
enhancement directly. 
The simulated transient waveforms of a five-stage bootstrapped ring oscillator under a power supply of 
0.5 V are depicted in Fig. 4-4. When Vin has a H-to-L transition, NOP has a L-to-H transition. It bootstraps NBP 
to 2VDD through boost capacitor CBP. At the same time, MP2 is turned on to deliver the bootstrapped NBP (2VDD) 
to Vout. The bootstrapped Vout (2VDD) does not only drive MN2 of the next stage better but also close MP1 better 
to reduce the leakage current and turn on MN1 better to enhance the pre-discharge of NBN (CBN). The same 
operation is for the L-to-H transition.

Low-voltage operation degrades the yield due to its serious process variations, especially in the 
sub-threshold operation. Although the boosted control signal pushes the driver transistors into the triode 
region, the residue circuit devices still incur the same serious problems with the variation. With fewer devices 
in the sub-threshold region, the proposed design is less affected by the process variation. In our design, all the 
devices are boosted into higher voltage region. For a design example, the proposed bootstrapped ring 
oscillator is designed as a VCO using supply-regulation technique. As compared to conventional 
inverter-based VCO, the VCO transfer curve in different process corners is shown in Fig. 4-5. We can easily 
find out that our design has better linearity and is less affected by  the process variation.  
In the PLLs design, the linearity of VCO is an important requirement. As we mentioned in (4-3), the 
proposed delay cell operates in linear region. Fig. 4-5 also shows that the linearity using the conventional 
inverter delay cells degrade while supply voltage goes down. At SS corner, the oscillator can hardly work 
below 0.3V. In addition, the gain of output frequency versus supply voltage (KVCO) is high which may lead to 
the large output jitter for the PLL system. As compared to the conventional one, the output swing of proposed 
delay cell keeps the transistors from operating in sub-threshold region at low supply voltage. The 
bootstrapped ring oscillator has better linearity, lower KVCO, and better immunity against process variation. 
Low-voltage multi-phase ADPLL 
The proposed ADPLL, as shown in Fig.4-6, is composed of a phase frequency detector (PFD) to detect the 
phase error, a phase selector (PS) to reroute the signal path, a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to convert the 
phase error into digital code, a digital loop filter (DLF) to filter out the high frequency noise, a digitally 
controlled oscillator (DCO) to generate the required output frequency, and a divider (DIV) to divide and feed 
back the output frequency. To improve the resolution of the DCO, a 4-bit sigma-delta modulator (SDM) is 
used for the dithering. 
21 
has high linearity and high immunity against process variation because most of the devices are operated in the 
triode region. 
 
Fig. 4-7. Circuit schematic of the proposed DCO 
According to our previous work, the proposed monotonic DCO is composed of a 5-stage BTRO with its 
supply voltage VC connected to a digitally controlled resistance network, as shown in Fig. 4-7. The VC of the 
BTRO is controlled by a resistance network. The resistance network consists of 9-bit PMOS transistor arrays, 
thermometer-code-to-binary-code (T2B) converters and an SDM. Fully thermometer control occupies large 
area with complicated wiring. Hybrid architecture of binary and thermometer control is reported and costs less 
chip area. Because the linearity of the BTRO highly depends on the supply voltage, the PMOS arrays are no 
longer binary weighted to obtain a better linearity. With a dedicated transistor sizing, the PMOS arrays are 
arranged in a segmented thermometer code manner which is composed of a 2-bit T2B and 3-bit T2B for 
coarse codes and 4-bit T2B for fine codes. Additionally, a 4-bit 1
st
-order SDM is used to dither the 
least-significant bit (LSB) of the DCO. Furthermore, in order to improve the conductivity of resistance 
network at sub-0.5V VDD, only four PMOS transistors stacked on each array. Fig. 4-8 shows the DCO out 
frequency versus the coarse control code of the proposed and the binary weighted. The proposed DCO gain is 
563 kHz/code of the simulated TT corner. The binary weighted control results in various tuning steps.

5. Test chips and the measured results 
In this section, we will showcase several practical chip implementations in the project. The project has 
taped out three nm-process chips. The first chip is the bootstrapped driver, ALBI fabricated in 90nm process; 
the second one is the bootstrapped driver ISBD fabricated in 55nm process; the third one is the BTRO and 
ADPLL fabricated in 90nm process. This section will show the test chips and the measured results. 
ALBI 
A test chip of ALBI is implemented in 90nm 1P9M SPRVT process to demonstrate the effectiveness of 
the proposed design scheme. The test circuits include the reported bootstrapped circuits in JSSC (1997), in T. 
VLSI (2008), and the proposed design. The circuits also contain test keys to verify the interconnection model. 
Each bootstrapped circuit is implemented as a 10-stage cascade driver chain. In each stage, two 30fF MOM 
capacitors serve as bootstrap capacitors and a 200fF MOM capacitor as CL. Level shifters are used to boost 
the 200mV internal signal to 500mV chip I/O signal for the measurement. The total area is958µm 776µm× , 
and the core area is 566µm 102µm× . Figure 5-1 shows the die photograph. The cell layout of the proposed 
bootstrapped inverter is 25.8µm 4.1µm× .

TABLE 6-3 lists the comparison results with some reported VCOs. Our proposed design is able to 
operate at only 0.2 V supply voltage, at the subthreshold supply. Additionally, the energy per cycle is 13 fJ at 
0.2 V, 53 fJ at 0.4 V, and 0.114 pJ at 0.6 V. This indicates that our design is more power efficient then the 
others.

Conclusions 
This project proposed several key components of on-chip bus design based with DVFS concept. The 
main application domain includes low-voltage circuit systems, and the body of the proposed on-chip bus has a 
segmented buffer structure. According to the test chips and measured results, we can summarize our 
contribution as follows.  
The ALBI describes a sub-threshold-supply bootstrapped CMOS inverter with an active leakage current 
reduction technique. Based on 4500 times of Monte Carlo simulations, the average delay time of the proposed 
design with 200fF CL is 6.9ns with a standard deviation of 6.3ns, which achieves a 76% reduction from the 
conventional inverter. Measured results verify that the test chip can achieve 10MHz clock rate under 200mV 
VDD. Due to the negative VGS suppression, the measured leakage power is more than 50% improvement of the 
previously reported bootstrapped drivers. The power consumption is 1.01µW, and the leakage power is 
107nW. 
The second, we successful explore on-chip bus design with ISBD under the 0.1–0.3V supply voltage. 
With the proposed bootstrapped CMOS repeater insertion ISI-suppressed technique can accumulate low ISI 
jitter and achieve high clock/data rate even under the subthreshold-supply. In addition, the proposed 
bootstrapped repeater improves energy efficiency and has a PLeakage/PT ratio less than 1% even though VDD = 
0.1V, which is one order better than the other designs. The Measured results verified that our design achieve 
100MHz (0.6MHz) clock link and 100Mbps (0.8Mbps) data link at 0.3V (0.1V) VDD. Additionally, our design 
is energy efficient with only 123fJ (40fJ) per bit.  
The third chip described a 0.2-0.6 V BTRO and a low-voltage ADPLL. The proposed delay cell 
improves the linearity of output frequency as function of VDD by operating in the linear region. Measured 
results verify that the test chip can achieve 48 MHz at 0.2 V, and 771 MHz at 0.6 V. The resulting phase noise 
is – 93 dBc/Hz at 0.2 V, – 90 dBc/Hz at 0.4 V and – 88.5 dBc/Hz at 0.6 V at a 1-MHz offset. The active core 
area of the BTRO is only 0.002 mm
2
. As compared to other reported work, our design has higher power 
efficiency. The proposed ADPLL has 10-phase output frequency and consumes 78µW at 480MHz under a VDD 
of 0.5V, which is occupied 53.8% by the DCO. The proposed ADPLL can work even at VDD = 0.25V with a lock 
range of 36.8 to 44.8MHz. In terms of the FoM in pJ/cycle, the proposed one is almost an order better than the 
others. The overall active area is 326µm×175µm.

    本發明所提出的「拔靴帶式環型振盪器」，使用拔靴帶式延遲
單元架構而成，並利用拔靴帶式電路的技巧來加速電路的頻率輸

達到低功率的效果。即便在接近電晶體臨界電壓之次臨界操作電
壓(Subthreshold-supply)的操作環境下，也可以使得電晶體免於操

技術說明 
A bootstrapped ring oscillator which can be operated under 
low-voltage supply even subthreshold-supply is proposed in the report. 
Lowering the supply voltage is a common technique in low power 
design. However, the supply voltage dropping especially near the 
threshold voltage of the transistors results in some problems. First of 
all current driving ability decreases severely and the circuit 
characteristic suffers from process variation. Our proposed 
bootstrapped d ring oscillator using the bootstrapped delay cell, which 
can strengthen the driving ability and push the devices into linear 
region. In addition, since every boosted transistor is no longer working 
at the sub-threshold region, the circuit won’t suffer from the process 
variation. Besides, the bootstrapped technique can suppress the 
leakage current and enhance the ION / IOFF ratio。Furthermore, the high 
linearity of the proposed oscillator provides lower jitter interference in 
timing circuit applications.

He also give us a basic level of background knowlwdge in areas such as anatomy, physiology and 
measurement methods in clinical practice will be assumed, taking account of the different background of 
thedelegates. 
In tutorial session 2, Dr. Brandl introuduce physical principles of optical sensors including light 
absortion,transmission, reflection, Fluorescence dyes, Surface plasmon resonance, and fiber optical sensors. 
In recent years, IC processing technologies have such a great improvement on dimension scaling down that 
many applications are realized. In terms of audio applications, rapid expansion of the biomedical-electronic 
and consumer-product market has necessitated low-power low-voltage low-area systems. Since the battery 
power is used for these devices, expanding the battery lifetime with low-power dissipation is very crucial. 
However, the threshold voltage is not scaled down linearly with the dimension. It increases the difficulty of 
the low voltage design. According to the power consumption law, the power is in proportion to the square of 
the supply voltage. In order to design low power circuit, the low voltage design is necessary. 
Integrate Circuit (IC) design is moving toward lower power consumption, lower voltage, and miniaturized 
size, thus expanding its applications in biomedical equipment to the benefit of patients. As hearing impaired 
individuals greatly vary in their range of auditory loss, a hearing aid system is designed with a tunable 
function to satisfy specific needs. In particular, a programmable automatic gain control (AGC) system is 
applied to such a tunable function. Importantly, low power dissipation of the hearing aid system is crucial to 
expanding the battery lifetime. By using system on chip (SOC) technology, we can integrate biosensor and 
bio-device, then building bio-instrumentation smaller and lighter, finally makes the patient more comfortable.

market has necessitated low-power low-voltage low-area systems. Since the battery 
power is used for these devices, expanding the battery lifetime with low-power 
dissipation is very crucial. However, the threshold voltage is not scaled down linearly 
with the dimension. It increases the difficulty of the low voltage design. According to 
the power consumption law, the power is in proportion to the square of the supply 
voltage. In order to design low power circuit, the low voltage design is necessary. 
Integrate Circuit (IC) design is moving toward lower power consumption, lower 
voltage, and miniaturized size, thus expanding its applications in biomedical 
equipment to the benefit of patients. As hearing impaired individuals greatly vary in 
their range of auditory loss, a hearing aid system is designed with a tunable function 
to satisfy specific needs. In particular, a programmable automatic gain control (AGC) 
system is applied to such a tunable function. Importantly, low power dissipation of the 
hearing aid system is crucial to expanding the battery lifetime. By using system on 
chip (SOC) technology, we can integrate biosensor and bio-device, then building 
bio-instrumentation smaller and lighter, finally makes the patient more comfortable.

近年來，次臨界操作一直是學界不斷嘗試的新領域，在類比放大器中，次臨界操作可提供
較大的增益，試用於生醫領域；數位方面可以用在低頻時脈的系統中。但是次臨界電路讓
人覺得垢病的有下列三點：(1)無法操作在高速的應用中；(2)無法提供較大的驅動力；(3)
有非常嚴重的製程漂移。本計畫中所新提出的拔靴帶式的電路技巧，可以同時解決這三個
問題，是一大突破。 
 技術創新 
本計畫中新提出的拔靴帶式的電路技巧有下列三點：(1)加速預充電能力；(2)抑制靜態漏
電流；(3)不增加電容元件。綜合這三點，本計畫中新提出的拔靴帶式，不但具有傳統拔
靴帶式的電路的驅動能力，更可以操作在高速的系統中，且具有低成本的優勢。 
 社會影響 
本計畫中對社會的影響主要有兩大方面，首先，新提出的動態調整電壓頻率機制，是目前
各方研究的熱門主題，動態調整電壓頻率機制，可以讓系統的效能與功率消耗最佳化。這
是現今眾所追求的綠能生活一致的目標。而另一方面則是我們以拔靴帶式技術所設計的電
