Abstract— In this paper, a method for designing square-
root (SR) FIR filters for quadrature-amplitude modulation
(QAM) applications is proposed. Unlike the previously
published method that used only the frequency domain
constraints, the proposed method considers some time-
domain constraints as well, including the inter-symbol
interference (ISI) and the eye opening of the eye pattern at
the receiver output. Design examples show that using the
time-domain constraints can result in a more robust eye
opening and thus a robust ISI performance at the presence
of clock skew.
I. INTRODUCTION
A pair of matched square-root (SR) filters of a Nyquist
filter, used in the transmitter and the receiver of a band-
limited digital communication system, can provide zero inter-
symbol interference (ISI) [1] (see Fig. 1). In practice, the
SR filters are realized in FIR form. Conventionally, the SR
filters are designed in the following manner: directly design the
Nyquist filter with a nonnegative frequency response (ignoring
the linear phase factor) [2]–[6]. After the coefficients of the
Nyquist filter have been found, the matched SR transmitter
and receiver filters are determined by performing a spectral
factorization on the Nyquist filter polynomial.
Although zero ISI is desired theoretically, in practice, it is
not always necessary. In [7], [8], a concept of the required ISI
was proposed. The required ISI should depend on the operating
point (BER vs SNR) of a band-limited digital communication
system. As long as the ISI is sufficiently small (not necessarily
zero), the BER performance of a communication system will
not be deteriorated much at the operating point. The small but
non-zero ISI can give us some degree of freedom in designing
the SR filters.
In practical implementation of a band-limited communica-
tion system, since the synchronization between the transmitter
and the receiver cannot be perfect, there must be some timing
skew between the transmitter clock and the receiver clock. This
timing skew will deteriorate the BER performance if the eye
opening of the eye pattern is not sufficiently large. On the other
hand, the quality of the eye pattern is determined by how the
SR filter is designed. Therefore, in addition to the conventional
frequency domain specifications and the ISI constraint, the eye
opening should also be considered in designing SR filters.
In this paper, a method for designing an SR filter is
proposed. The proposed method takes the filter’s stopband

attenuation, the required ISI, and the eye opening into account
simultaneously. This paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, an example demonstrates that, at a certain operating point
of a communication system, the required ISI need not be
zero. In Section III, the formulation of the proposed method
is presented. Numerical design examples are given in Section
IV. Finally, a summary of conclusions is given in Section V.
II. REQUIRED ISI AT THE OPERATING POINT
We use the following example to demonstrate that the
required ISI should depend on the operating point of a dig-
ital communication system. The SR filters in the following
example are asymmetrical.
Example 1: A BPSK communication system with SR filters
at both transmitter and receiver is used. The system is designed
to be operated at 10 dB SNR. The specifications of the SR
filter are given as follows: the minimum stopband attenuation
SBATT = 23.5 dB, the roll-off factor α = 0.25, and the over-
sampling ratio T = 4. The term over-sampling ratio T means
that T samples per symbol are transmitted. According to the
Nyquist criterion, T ≥ 2.
Two SR filters are designed. One is designed with −23
dB ISI by the method of [7]. Its length is 21. The other is
designed with zero ISI by the conventional method. Having 24
taps, it is 14.3% longer than the filter with −23 dB ISI. Bit-
error-rate (BER) simulation results of a BPSK communication
system using these two different SR filters are shown in
Fig. 2. The symbol ‘∗’ denotes the BER performance of the
system with zero-ISI SR filters and the symbol ‘+’ denotes
the BER performance of the system employing the SR filters
that produce −23 dB ISI. One can see that, at the 10 dB SNR
operating point, the BER resulting from the two SR filters are
almost the same. However, the length of the −23 dB-ISI SR
filter is shorter than that of the zero-ISI SR filter. Therefore,
if we take the operating point of a communication system
into account, we can relax the zero-ISI constraint and we can
perhaps use a pair of simpler SR filters.
When we develop the method for designing SR filters in
the next section, we shall adopt the required ISI as an input
parameter.

The last thing we need to examine is the frequency response
at ω = pi/T . At that frequency, the magnitude response of a
Nyquist filter should be 1/2 [10], i.e.,

Combining (2), (4), (6), and (7), one can formulate the
design problem as follows. Given γISI and γEYE,

−δ ≤ 0
bN−1T c∑

∣∣∣h(N − 1 + jT )∣∣∣ ≤ γISI

.
The above formulation is not linear yet because the second
and the third constraints contain the absolute values of the
unknowns. However, it can be translated into a linear program-
ming problem by the following way. For the second constraint,
all combinations of positive and negative signs of all unknowns
are used to replace the absolute values of them; i.e., the second
constraint is replaced by the following 2b(N−1)/Tc constraints,
bN−1T c∑
j=1
±h(N − 1 + jT ) ≤ γISI
2T
. (9)
The above maneuver will make the problem size exponentially
increase. However, one can use any heuristic method to cut the
problem size down.
On the other hand, for the third constraint, since the Nyquist
filter coefficients h(n)s have alternate signs before and after
the zero crossing instances N − 1 + jT, j > 0, the sign of
h(N − 1 + jT ± 1) can be easily predicted. Therefore, the
third constraint can be rewritten as
bN−1T c∑
j=1
(−1)j−1
(
h(N − 2 + jT )− h(N + jT )
)
− h(N)
2γEYE
≤ 0
(10)
After translating the second and third constraints of (8)
into (9) and (10), one can use a standard linear programming
problem solver to obtain the Nyquist filter coefficients. Next,
the matched SR transmitter and receiver filters, ht(n) and
hr(n), are determined by performing a spectral factorization
on the Nyquist filter polynomial.

IV. DESIGN EXAMPLES
Example 2: Three SR filters are designed for the BPSK
application described in Example 1. The first one is the same
as the conventional FIR filter with zero ISI in Example 1.
Its length is 24. The second one is designed by the proposed
method with −31 dB ISI. However, the constraint over the eye
opening is not specified. Hence, the optimization still follows
(8) but the third constraint of (8) is ignored. The outcome filter
has 21 taps. This design process is named as a ‘method without
EYE control’. The last one is also designed by the proposed
method with −31 dB ISI. Now, the third constraint of (8) is
taken into account and γEYE is set as 1.27 dB. The resultant
filter has 23 taps. This design process is named as a ‘method
with EYE control’. All three SR filter coefficients are shown
in Table I.
Next, receiver clock skew is applied. The receiver clock may
not be synchronous with the symbol timing at the transmitter.
This will degrade the ISI performance. Fig. 2 shows the
simulation results for three communication system employing
three SR filter mentioned above at the presence of receiver
clock skew. The x-axis is the standard deviation of the receiver
clock skew, σ, divided by T .

VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we use a simple linearized PLL model to derive
an upper bound of the phase-jitter variance of a third-order charge-
pump PLL frequency synthesizer. From Inequality (28) shown in
Section IV, a small frequency divisor  , a large $

, a small $

,
and a large pumping current  
 
are helpful for reducing the phase-
jitter variance. An optimal resistance 

can also be obtained from
Equation (29) given in Section IV.
Although using a linear model to analyze a PLL output phase
jitter is not a new concept, through the experimental results, we
see that the closed form for the variance of the PLL output phase
jitter predicted by our theory is sufficiently good. Therefore, the
formula we derived in Section IV is helpful for the engineers to
design third-order charge-pump PLL frequency synthesizers.

5 月 29 日上午的 Keynote speaker 是 Texas Instruments
的一位副總 Dr. Dennis Buss，他的講題為 Si Technology 
Roadmap For Ubiquitous Computing, Sensing, and 
Perception，他為 SOC 整合 low power、low cost 的技術，提
出一份 roadmap，並認為 Moor’s Law 對 technology scaling
所做的預測雖終將失效，可是 SOC 的出現，整合多種功能
於單一晶片的趨勢，將使系統功能的成長，仍維持 Moor’s 
Law 的軌跡。 
之後我參觀了 poster session 中與 DSP 相關的部分，與許多學者討論了很多有趣的問題，
我的論文被安排在 5 月 29 日下午的第二個時段 FIR Digital Filters (Lecture) 中發表，我們提出
了一種設計對稱式 pulse shaping filters 的方法，因利用係數的對稱性，所以可節省一些硬體及
功率，我們也針對傳統上 pulse shaping filters 要求 zero inter-symbol interference (ISI) 的部分，
提出 zero ISI 不一定需要的觀點，我們認為需視通訊系統的工作點而設定所謂的 required ISI，
這有助於減少複雜度與功率消秏，之後回答了幾個問題，就完成我此行的最大任務。 
5 月 30 日上午的 Keynote speaker 是 M.I.T. Media Laboratory 的 Dr. Rosalind W. Picard，她
的講題是 Emotional Intelligence Technology and the Death of Clippy，這個題目是一跨領域的題
目，甚至與心理學有關，即使是所需與電機系相關的技術，如 multidimensional signal modeling, 
computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, and human-computer interaction，我也不熟
悉，由於實在是不懂，我也只能外行看熱鬧而已。 
因考量到 New Orleans 的治安不佳，30 日我就離
開 New Orleans，到休士頓等回台灣的班機，臨行前再
與 Professor Willson 夫妻及學弟妹合影留念。這次的
ISCAS 同前幾次一樣，讓我收穫滿滿，雖然國科會剩
餘的補助不足，讓我從 1 月確知論文被接受後，到處
找補助出國，所幸由台科大論文獎勵費中湊到一些
錢，雖然仍不夠，但總不至於讓我去不成，十分感謝國科會與台科大在經費上的支持，讓我
完成這次 ISCAS 2007 之行。
