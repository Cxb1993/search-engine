 applications (for example, vibrations of naval 
structures in fluids) and in advanced applications 
(for example, vibrations of magneto-electrically 
driven micro-electromechanical systems). In 
addition to the practical importance, the nonlinear 
vibration analysis of a magneto-elastic plate in 
fluid is of fundamental interest in the theory of 
nonlinear dynamical systems. Some researchers 
[1-3] have already tackled the problem of 
nonlinear vibrations of acoustically loaded elastic 
structures. The purpose of their investigations 
was to search for the possibility of energy 
exchange between vibrations at different 
frequencies and different modes that are 
uncoupled in a linear theory. Dowell [1] 
demonstrated that these interaction effects are 
generated by structural nonlinearities, while an 
acoustic part of the problem may be considered as 
a linear one in weak fluid excitation. Furthermore, 
it was assumed that resonant frequencies of an 
elastic structure are not influenced by the added 
mass of a surrounding acoustic medium. 
Abrahams [2] and Engineer and Abrahams [3] 
performed the analysis of non-linear vibrations of 
a baffled plate and a cylindrical shell in several 
excitation states by using the theory of non-linear 
structural-acoustic coupling. In the most general 
case of a non-linear acoustic medium coupled 
with a non-linear elastic structure, Nayfeh and 
Kelly [4] have proved that the motion of the fluid 
at a certain distance from a vibrating body ceases 
to be of an acoustic nature as shock waves are 
developed. However, the non-linear formulation 
of structural-acoustic coupling in heavy fluid 
loading conditions is not necessarily associated 
with transforming the acoustic waves into the 
shock ones. In order to consider a quadratic term 
in the Bernoulli integral for inspecting effects of 
second order in the linear acoustic field, the 
method stated by Lord Rayleigh [5] was adopted. 
Recently, Sorokin [6] has suggested a model of 
heavy loading of a non-linear elastic structure by 
a dense and weakly compressible fluid, and he 
has investigated several non-linear effects 
produced by the fluid’s non-linearity. In addition, 
the investigations done by Sorokin [7], 
Leppington [8], Crighton et al [9] and Sorokin 
[10] have shed some lights in the aforementioned 
research field. However, sometimes the structures 
are subjected to the effects of a magnetic field, 
therefore it is necessary to reformulate the 
nonlinear vibration analysis of a fluid plate 
subjected to the effects of a magnetic field. The 
following researchers made significant 
contributions in the vibration analysis of 
structures in a magnetic field. Moon and Pao [11] 
have proposed a mathematical model for the 
buckling problem of a cantilever beam-plate in a 
transverse magnetic field with distributed 
magnetic forces and torques. Wallerstein and 
Peach [12] have studied the magneto-elastic 
buckling of beams and plates with magnetically 
soft material. Miya et al. [13] have investigated 
the magneto-elastic buckling of a cantilevered 
beam-plate using experimental and finite element 
methods. Moon and Pao [14] have presented the 
vibration and parametric instability of a 
cantilevered beam-plate in a transverse magnetic 
field and also provided the theoretical and 
experimental results. In the Moon-Pao theoretical 
analysis, the magnetic torque without axial load 
was considered, but the axial pulsating load 
wasn’t included in their discussion. Kojima and 
Nagana [15] have investigated the case of 
nonlinear forced vibrations on a beam with a tip 
mass subjected to alternating electromagnetic 
forces acting on the tip mass. Shin, Wu and Chen 
[16] have studied the transient vibrations of a 
simply supported beam with axial loads and 
transverse magnetic fields. Recently Liu and 
Chang [17] performed the vibration analysis of a 
magneto-elastic beam with general boundary 
conditions subjected to axial load. Hasanyan et al. 
[18] used the method of multiple scales to 
investigate the nonlinear vibration and instability 
of perfectly conductive plates in an inclined 
magnetic field. The purpose of the present study 
is to adopt the non-linear structural-acoustic 
coupling formulation suggested in references [6-7] 
to the case of weak fluid loading of a structure 
subjected to an inclined magnetic field. Weak 
excitation conditions are taken into account with

plate are assumed as simply supported at both

 The first three resonant eigenvalues of a fluid-
loaded plate with or without magnetic field have 
been computed and presented in the first and 
second columns separately in Table 1. According 
to Table 1, the resonant eigenvalues without 
magnetic field based on the present study match 
those values from Reference [10] and Reference 
[7]. Meanwhile, the resonant eigenvalues of an 
isolated plate (no fluid) are listed in the last 
column for comparison. It can be concluded that 
not only the effect of the added mass on the 
resonant eigenvalues is quite significant, but also 
the effect of magnetic field on the resonant 
eigenvalues is notable. It is very obvious that the 
resonant eigenvalues are related to the ratio L/h. 
Figure 1 presents the first resonant eigenvalues 
versus the thickness of the plate with or without 
magnetic field. We detect that the effect of the 
magnetic field tends to decrease the magnitude of 
the first resonant eigenvalues. In Figures 2-3, we 
plot the second and third resonant eigenvalues 
separately with respect to the thickness of the 
plate with or without magnetic field; similar 
trends can be drawn except the effect of the 
magnetic field decreases, which is reasonable. In 
Figure 4, we plot the first three resonant 
eigenvalues against the thickness of the plate in 
the magnetic field (R=8) individually; once again, 
the first three resonant eigenvalues gets smaller as 
the thickness of the plate decreases. In Figure 5, 
the first resonant eigenvalues versus the intensity 
of the magnetic field is presented, and it can be 
found that as the intensity of the magnetic field 
gets larger, the magnitude of the first resonant 
eigenvalues gets smaller. 
 
In order to produce a very large amplitude of 
displacement of a rather thick plate, first we 
choose h/L=0.1 and 30 1020.0/
−×=Ef , and we 
denote 
L
rA =  as a normalized amplitude. For 
simplicity, we assume that the driving load is 
distributed in the kth mode shape, i.e., 
)()( xWxF k= .  Without the effect of magnetic 
field (R=0), the first resonant eigenvalue is 
computed as 501.21 =λ , and the corresponding 
first natural frequency is 93.2901 =ω  rad/sec; 
while if we consider the effect of magnetic field 
(R=8), the first resonant eigenvalue is calculated 
as 602.11 =λ , and the corresponding first natural 
frequency is 28.1201 =ω  rad/sec. In Figure 6, the 
normalized amplitude A is presented with respect 
to the driving frequency of the driving load 
without the effect of magnetic field (R=0), as 
seen in the figure, the amplitude based on the 
linear theory is larger than that of the nonlinear 
theory, which is fairly reasonable. In Figure 7, 
with the presence of the magnetic field (R=8) the 
amplitude from the linear theory is much larger 
than that of the same case without the magnetic 
field as presented in Figure 6; furthermore, the 
amplitude of the nonlinear theory is much less 
than that of the linear theory. It can be inferred 
that the effect of magnetic field has a significant 
impact on the amplitude of the plate, especially 
when the driving frequency of the excitation load 
is near the first natural frequency of the plate. It 
can also be concluded from Figure 6 that in the 
case of a thick plate the contributions due to the 
 linearity and linear effect of magnetic field only, 
and the fluid nonlinearity does not have any 
contributions to the amplitude of the response 
since the fluid loading is assumed to be weak. For 
a rather thick plate without the effect of magnetic 
field, the contributions due to the structural 
nonlinearity and acoustical linear radiation 
damping are of the same order. However, with 
the presence of magnetic field the influence of 
structural nonlinearity is still pronounced, but the 
resonant peak of the nonlinear response has 
disappeared as compared with that of the linear 
response. For a thin plate, the structural 
nonlinearity completely controls the behavior of 
the plate, which implies that in this case the 
effects of fluid loading is considerably negligible 
as compared with the effect of structural 
nonlinearity. In general, it can be concluded that 
the effects of magnetic field plays an important 
role only on the first few modes, as indicative of 
the first two modes dealt with in this study. In 
addition, the effects of structural nonlinearity on 
the behavior of the plate is quite remarkable for 
the first few modes, however, it is negligible as 
the higher modes are concerned.

In this study, the damping coefficient of the dashpot and the 
spring constants of the linear and nonlinear springs are 
considered as stochastic to characterize the random properties 
of the viscoelastic materials. Applying the perturbation 
technique, the following equations can be written: 
 
...2

...2
2
1 +++= pppp εε (5)

1 +++= qqqq εε              (6) 
 
where c  is the mean value of the damping coefficient, ε is a 
zero-mean small parameter and ic are parameters of order i , 
the similar definitions can be denoted in equations (5-6). 
Similarly, the displacement x  of the springs can be written as 
follows: 
 
              ...2
2
1 +++= xxxx εε              (7) 
 
Substituting equations (4-7) into equation (3) and applying the 
perturbation technique to equation (3), we can obtain the 
following equation based on the zero order of ε : 
 
 ( ) ( ) ( )tCxtBxtAx ++= 2&           (8) 
 
where

here       ,

Based on the first order of ε , we can get the following

(14)         
 
First of all, we can get the closed-form solution for the 
displacement x  in equation (8), then 1x  can be calculated 
by using equation (12) readily. Generally speaking, the solution 
to equation (12) must be estimated numerically due to its 
complexity. Eventually the statistical quantities of the 
displacement x  can be estimated by using equation (7). 
 
  
 CLOSED-FORM SOLUTION 
 
Equation (8) is a nonlinear non-homogeneous first-order 
differential equation, which happens to be a typical Riccati 
equation. To solve it, first try a particular solution as follows:  
 
βα += txp                        (15) 
 
Substituting equation (15) into equation (8) yields

Based on the zero order of t, we obtain: 
 
ββα rs −= 2                           (17) 
 
Based on the first order of t, we obtain:

Based on the second order of t, we obtain: 
 
22 20 sasas +−= αα                           (19) 
 
Solving the above equations simultaneously gives:

addition, we can also add higher order dashpot (such as second-
order dashpot) to the linear dashpot in parallel to describe the 
responses with quadratic components of the velocity. Once 
again, there is no way to obtain the closed-form solution to the 
mean value of the displacement. Needless to say, we can 
always estimate the solution to the higher-order model 
numerically, however, our goal is to present a simplified model 
to describe the nonlinear properties of the nonlinear system so 
that the closed-form solution to the mean value of the 
displacement is quite significant, since it is a basic solution for 
estimating the statistical response of some other quantities. In 
addition, if the stretched rate of the displacement is time 
dependent, then the numerical solution to the mean value of the 
displacement must be performed because getting the closed-
form solution is out of the question. In order to get higher order 
statistical quantities, we must match the higher order of ε , 
and then solve the equations successively; numerical 
approximation will be inevitable in that case. 
 
 
NUMERICAL EXAMPLES 
 
In the numerical analysis, the following parameter values 
are adopted for describing the properties of the nonlinear 
model:  
 
0.1=c  N-s/cm , 0.1=p  N/cm, 0.1=q  N/cm 
0.1=a  cm/s, .01.02 =⎥⎦

⎡εE    
 
 
In Figures 2-4, the mean value, standard deviation and 
coefficient of variation (COV) of the displacement of the 
nonlinear model are presented with respect to time. As it can be 
seen from Figure 2, the mean value of the displacement 
increases nonlinearly as time gets larger, which is very 
reasonable for the nonlinear model. In Figure 3, the standard 
deviation of the displacement also increases nonlinearly with 
respect to time, which is very similar to that in Figure 2. It is 
noted that from Figure 4 the coefficient of variation (COV) of 
the displacement fluctuates only between 0.18 and 0.20, which 
is almost a constant. In Figures 5-7, the mean value, standard 
deviation and coefficient of variation (COV) of the velocity of 
the nonlinear system are described with respect to time. Once 
again, the similar phenomena can be drawn as in Figures 2-4 
except the COV of the velocity is mostly higher than that of the 
displacement. Finally, in Figures 8-10 we plot the mean value, 
standard deviation and coefficient of variation (COV) of the 
force of the nonlinear system with respect to time. The similar 
trends of the numerical results are detected as in the previous 
figures except the COV of the force oscillates between 0.08 
and 0.14, which is generally lower than the other two. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
In this investigation, a simplified spring-dashpot model 
is proposed to represent the complicated nonlinear response of 
some viscoelastic materials. First of all, we adopt the standard 
Maxwell fluid model to obtain the softening behavior of the 
material, then we add a nonlinear spring in parallel to the linear 
spring to form a simplified nonlinear fluid model. Sometimes it 
is impossible to estimate the constant parameters in the model 
deterministically, therefore, the damping coefficient of the 
dashpot and the spring constants of the linear and nonlinear 
springs are considered as stochastic to characterize the random 
properties of the viscoelastic materials. The mean value of the 
displacement of the nonlinear model, subjected to constant rate 
displacement, can be solved analytically. Based on the closed-
form solution, the proposed method produces the statistical 
responses of the simplified nonlinear fluid model. The 
computed statistical responses play an important role in 
performing the reliability analysis of the simplified nonlinear 
fluid model.
