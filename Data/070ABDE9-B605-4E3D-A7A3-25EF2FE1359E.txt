Abstract
Dynamical switching behaviors of a
compliant bistable mechanism driven by
electromagnetic force are investigated. The
mechanism can be used for
assembly/disassembly of micro components.
Finite element analyses are used to characterize
the bistability of the mechanism under static
loading. An analytical model is developed to
analyze the dynamic behaviors of the
mechanism. The main advantage of this
dynamic actuation method is the absence of
on-chip driving mechanisms. The dynamical
switching characteristics of the bistable
mechanism are examined. Microscale
prototypes are fabricated and tested. Using the
driving technique, we demonstrate dynamical
switching in the fabricated device and verify that
the performance predicted by theory is attained.
Keywords: Dynamical switching; bistable
mechanism; assembly;disassembly
二、Introduction
Bistable micromechanisms (BMs) are
gaining attention in MEMS applications such as
accelerometers [1], memory cells [2], switches
[3-6], relays [7-9], valves [10] and feeding
systems [11]. One advantage of BMs is that no
3numerical integration. Figure 6 shows the
fabrication steps of the devices by an
electroforming process on glass substrates.
Figure 7(a) shows a photo of a fabricated BM.
The devices are tested in air using the
experimental apparatus shown schematically in
Figure 7(b). Figures 8(a-e) and (f-j) show
snapshots of forward and backward motions,
respectively. Sinusoidal currents of 96 and 72
mA peak-to-peak with no dc offset are passed
through the contact pads at frequency 2.3 and
3.3 kHz to dynamically switch the mechanism
forward and backward, respectively, and these
currents are less than the minimum currents
needed for static switching, i.e. 169 and 131 mA
for forward and backward motion, respectively.
四、Self critique
This proposal intended to design and
fabricated an on-substrate mechanism for micro
assembly task. A new mechanism for driving
the assembly mechanism was developed,
fabricated and successfully tested. Integration
of the driving mechanism and the assembly
mechanism is underway. Two papers have
been submitted for publication. They are
currently under review.
Dynamical switching of a compliant
bistable mechanism driven by electromagnetic
force is a new concept. The mechanism is used
for assembly/disassembly of micro components.
A patent application was filed based on the
outcome of this research.  It’s titled “振動驅動
的微定位機構”.
