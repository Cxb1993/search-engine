Effect of experimental conditions on measuring auto-ignition

Abstract：Autoignition temperature (AIT) is defined as the lowest temperature at which a substance will produce 
hot-flame ignition in air at atmospheric pressure without the aid of an external energy source such as spark or 
flame. The principal application of AIT is to define the maximum acceptable surface temperature in a particular 
area, usually for electrical classification purpose. Although AITs are indispensable information to safely handle 
flammable liquids, the reported AITs of flammable liquids in different data compilations are very diverse. 
Sometimes, the difference in separated compilations might up to more than 300K. This article aims at exploring 
quantitative effect of flask material, ambient temperature and ambient humidity on the accuracy for measuring AIT 
via the method of ASTM E659. To effectively analyze these factors simultaneously, the L9(34) orthogonal array are 
adopted to plan the experiments and this experimental matrix is then carefully conducted in a temperature and 
humidity controlled laboratory chamber. It is found that ambient humidity does not affect the measured AIT, but 
both flask material and ambient temperature are significant factors to the AIT experiment. An experiment of 
measuring AIT conducted with a flask of quartz is found to result in a reported AIT value higher than the one 
conducted with a flask of borosilicate by 20 ; and a quadratic relation between the reported AIT value and ℃ the 
ambient temperature is found. A quadratic polynomial of y = 3.450×10-2 x2 - 1.454x + 3.711×102 could properly fit 
the relation between the reported AIT value and the ambient temperature with R2 = 0.9939. According to 
aforementioned relation, the ambient temperature at which the lowest AIT appears is about 21 .℃

INTRODUCTION 
 
Autoignition temperature (AIT), which is also 
referred to as spontaneous ignition 
temperature (SIT), is defined as the lowest 
temperature at which a substance will produce 
hot-flame ignition in air at atmospheric 
pressure without the aid of an external energy 
source such as spark or flame. Based on the 
classical thermal theory of ignition, AIT can 
be regarded as that temperature to which a 
combustible mixture must be raised so that the 
rate of heat evolved by the exothermic 
oxidation reactions of the system will just 
overbalance the rate at which heat is lost to the 
surroundings [1]. The ability of a substance to 
spontaneously ignite introduces potential 
safety hazards for all who handle, transport, 
and store combustible materials. The principal 
application of AIT is to define the maximum 
acceptable surface temperature in a particular 
area, usually for electrical classification 
purpose, for example, article 500.8 of NFPA 
70, also known as the National Electric Code, 
provides that “Class I equipment shall not 
have any exposed surface that operates at a 
temperature in excess of the ignition 
temperature of the specific gas or vapors” [2]. 
Other applications include the hazard risk 
assessment of process equipment, for example, 
API Publication 581, which is also known as 
Risk-based inspection base resource document, 
requires the AIT of a flammable liquid to 
define the possible consequence in case a 
leakage occurs [3]. 
Although the AITs of flammable liquids 
are indispensable information to safely handle 
flammable liquids, the reported AITs are very 
diverse in different data compilations. 
Sometimes, the difference between these 
reported AITs might up to even 300K. For 
example, as it is shown in table 1, the AIT of 
acetaldehyde was reported to range from 
413K to 758.15K in five different 
authoritative sources [4-8]. Table 1 also lists 
some compounds that the difference in the 
reported AITs is more than 100K from 
As visual inspection was chosen to detect 
the sudden appearance of a flame inside the 
autoignition vessel in almost all existing 
methods of measuring AIT, thus the accuracy 
for measuring AIT is greatly limited by human 
capabilities. It has been pointed that in some 
cases autoignition actually begins with a 
nonluminous or barely luminous reaction 
which is difficult to detect by existing 
methods. Moreover, some researches also 
revealed that the measurement of AIT was 
notorious sensitive to vessel cleanliness, 
injection rate and uniformity of sample 
dispersion [13-14]. All of aforementioned 
effects make the values of reported AIT very 
diverse , even the same test method is 
employed. Thus, the reproducibility, i.e. the 
difference between measurements reported by 
two different laboratories, was announced to 
be 5% of the temperature in degree Celsius in 
ASTM E659 methods [11]. In fact, some 
authors pointed the average error in measuring 
AIT was around 30K [15]. 
Because of aforementioned accuracy and 
precision problem in measuring AIT, many 
theoretical methods were proposed to predict 
the AIT [10,13-21]. These predictive methods 
could be divided into two classes: (1) the 
quantitative-structure-property-relation 
approach and (2) the structure group 
contribution approach; the former used 
selected molecular descriptors to predict AIT 
and the later considered the contributions of 
molecular group in a compound to predict AIT. 
However, as all these predictive methods 
needed a large reliable data set of AIT to 
construct their models, the predictive 
performance of those models are very limited. 
In fact, a predictive error up to 70K is a very 
common case for them. 
As we know the purpose of the DIPPR 
project sponsored by the American Institute of 
Chemical Engineering (AIChE) is to satisfy 
industry needs for better data to meet new and 
more stringent requirements, such as 
environmental and safety regulations, so most 
properties reported in the DIPPR data set have 
been critical reviewed for consistency and 
soundness; however, AIT values reported in 
DIPPR database are still flagged as 
unevaluated now [4]. To author’s opinions, 
this situation might be attributed to the 
following two reasons. First, there are two 
now-existing standard test methods to measure 
AIT, i.e. ASTM E659 and DIN 51794, but it is 
very common that the results obtained from 
these two methods are different. Second, the 
AIT experiment is very laborious and requires 
patience very much, so there is very limited 
literature published recently. It is found in our 
experience that one test will last 24 to 48 
hours and in most of the time the operator 
must be present. Thus, although research on 
predicting AIT is very active in recent years, 
experimental research, to author’s knowledge, 
is very rare in recent years[22,23]. To this line, 
a systematical experimental study for the AIT 
of flammable liquids is still indispensable to 
those who handle and operate the flammable 
liquids. 
To make the experimental results of AIT 
be valuable to the chemical industries, the first 
question for the researcher is to choose the test 
method from the existing method of ASTM 
E659 and DIN 51794. Based on the fact that 
ASTM E659 was cited by NFPA 70, 497 and 
921 and the fact that ASTM E659 method 
usually reported a lower AIT than DIN 51794 
method, which will result in safer protection 
strategies for hazard assessment, ASTM E659 
method is employed in present study. 
This article is organized as follow. First, 
the experimental details, including apparatus, 
chemicals and procedures are described in 
section 2. The experimental design plan is also 
discussed in this section. The experimental 
results are presented and discussed in section 
3. Finally, main findings of this work are 
concluded in section 4. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 
 
EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS AND 
PROCEDURE 
Autoignition temperature measurements were 
made on the KOEHER company’s K47000 
autoignition apparatus. This instrument is 
designed to meet the test requirements 
described by the test method of ASTM 
E659-78(2005), Standard Test Method for 
Autoignition Temperature of Liquid 
Chemicals [11]. The apparatus consists of a 
commercial 500-ml borosilicate round-bottom, 
short-necked boiling flask wrapped with 
aluminum foil and electrical heated furnace 
with a cylindrical interior shape to maintain 
CONTROL FACTORS AND THEIR 
LEVELS 
The aim of this study is to explore how the 
flask material, environmental temperature and 
ambient humidity quantitatively affect the 
experimental result in measuring AIT. As 
earlier mentioned, the material of the test flask 
is assigned to be of borosilicate in the test 
method of ASTM E659-78(2005), but in our 
experience a flask made of borosilicate is apt 
to be softened and will change its shape while 
conducting an experiment with the 
temperature higher than 800℃, so a flask 
made of quartz is employed as the other level 
of this control factor because quartz is one of 
the few materials that can combine the 
chemical inert and high temperature properties 
required. 
The levels of the ambient temperatures 
considered in this study are selected to be of 
20 , 30  and 40 ; and the levels of the ℃ ℃ ℃
humidity are then chosen to be of 0.011, 0.012 
and 0.013 kg water/ kg air. Although it is a 
laboratory custom to use the relative humidity 
instead of the absolute humidity, we adopt 
here the absolute humidity as the unit of the 
humidity to avoid the interaction effects 
between the ambient temperature and the 
relative humidity. The relative humidity is 
defined as the percentage ratio of actual partial 
pressure of the water vapor present to its 
equilibrium vapor pressure at the ambient 
temperature, which obviously depends on the 
ambient temperature. The levels of ambient 
temperatures selected are due to the capability 
of temperature control range in our chamber; 
and the levels of the humidity are decided so 
because of the saturation of vapor. The 
experimental levels of the humidity and 
temperature in a psychrometric charts are 
shown in figure 1. As figure 1 shows, in case 
of 20 , a humidity of 0.013 kg water/ kg air ℃
is about 88% of the relative humidity; and in 
case of 40 , a humidity of 0.011 kg water/ kg ℃
air is about 25% of the relative humidity. 
Table 3 summarizes all the levels of the three 
control factors considered in this study.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
A typical time history of the temperature 
inside the test flask during an experiment is 
shown in figure 2. In this figure exact 
magnitudes of the temperature are not 
intended to be necessarily significant as the 
recorder is set to be of different scaling factors 
in different temperature ranges. The initial dip 
on the curve shown in the figure is caused by 
cooling due to vaporization of the sample. The 
occurrence of an auto-ignition evidenced by 
the sudden appearance of a flame inside the 
flask and by a sharp rise in the temperature of 
the gas mixture. When the mixture exhibited 
flames at the preset temperature, next sample 
of the same quantity is tested at a lower 
temperature. These procedures were repeated 
until the lowest temperature at which the 
sample of given quantity exhibited flame was 
obtained. These experiments were represented 
by those points on a vertical line shown in 
figure 3. Then, different sample quantities are 
employed until the amount gives the lowest 
temperature of auto-ignition is obtained. 
Figure 3 shows the experimental results for 
the case of test run #3. In this figure, circle is 
used to represent the flammable case and cross 
is used to represent the nonflammable case; 
and the autoignition temperature corresponds 
to the given test run is designated as a triangle. 
Likewise, such experiments are conducted for 
all the nine test runs described in table 4 and 
the results of AIT are summarized in table 5.

from this figure that there is a quadratic 
relation between the reported AIT and the 
ambient temperature. A quadratic polynomial 
of y = 3.450×10-2 x2 - 1.454x + 3.711×102

lowest AIT is reported is found to be about

1. Introduction 
Many manufacturing processes involve flammable chemicals, and an accident involving a fire or an explosion can occur in 
storage or process equipment if a flammable chemical exists inside it or if the loss of containment of flammable chemicals occurs. As 
the gas mixture of a flammable substance could be ignited only if the concentration of the flammable substance lying within a given 
range known as the flammability limits. Thus, the flammability limits are one of the important features in the development of safe 
practices for handling a flammable vapor or gas. For this reason, they constitute a crucial issue in research on processing and storing 
flammable chemicals safely. In the literature, different methods have been proposed to predict the flammability limits of a flammable 
chemical, especially the lower flammability limit of a pure flammable chemical [1-2]. 
Industry works with mixtures under many situations, for example, in a reactor or in a distillation column. The Le Chatelier 
equation is the one that widely adopted to estimate the flammability limits of a mixture composed of flammable gases [3-6]. Complex 
mixtures composed of flammable gases and nonflammable gases are also formed in the procedure known as inerting in process 
industries. Inerting is the process of adding an inert gas to a combustible mixture to reduce the concentration of oxygen below the 
limiting oxygen concentration (LOC) for the purpose of lowering the likelihood of explosion [7-8]. The inert gas is usually nitrogen or 
carbon dioxide, although sometimes steam may be used. 
As the inert gas does not take part in the reaction mechanism, the method of calculated adiabatic flame temperatures is usually 
applied to estimate the flammability limits of a mixture of fuel and inert gas in the literature [9-10]. Vidal et al. suggested that the 
method of calculated adiabatic flame temperatures is a powerful tool to estimate the lower flammability limit (LFL) of a gas mixture 
composed of fuel and inert gas, and an adiabatic flame temperature of approximately 1400 K will yield the most desirable results for 
both methane and ethylene when the predicted results are compared to the existing experimental data [9]. Shebeko et al. pointed that 
there exist two rival reaction mechanisms in a combustion system involving H2/CO/O2/N2: (1) if the HO2 free radical reacts to 
generate an OH free radical or an O free radical, the combustion reaction will sustain; and (2) if the HO2 free radical reacts to 
generate O2, the combustion reaction will terminate. Consequently, the combustion reaction does not proceed unless the temperature 
is above a specific threshold temperature (Tcr) at which the reaction rate of mechanism (1) will prevail over that of mechanism (2). 
The flammability limits of a flammable material are the conditions under which the produced reaction heat can just raise the 
temperature of the system to such a threshold, which is usually expressed as the adiabatic flame temperature of the combustion 
system [10]. Therefore, through the calculation of this threshold temperature, the flammability limits of a mixture composed of fuel 
and inert gas can be obtained. Prediction models based on adiabatic temperature theories typically produce satisfactory results in 
forecasting LFL; however, this is not the case in predicting the upper flammability limit (UFL). 
Because the procedure of diluting a combustible gas with inert gas could be also taken as a mixing process of fuel and inert gas, 
Knodo et al. have attempted to modify the famous Le Chatelier equation so that it could be applied to predict the flammability limits 
of a mixture composed of fuel and inert gas [11-12]. The following assumptions were included in their work: (K1) at LFL, the heat of 
combustion per mole of a mixture composed of fuel gas and inert gas is equal to the heat of combustion per mole of pure fuel gas 
times the molar fraction of the fuel gas in the mixture (i.e., adding inert gas to fuel gas does not change the reaction mechanism at 
LFL); (K2) the heat release is the same for all limit mixtures at LFL; (K3) the fuel gas would react completely when combustion 
takes place at LFL; (K4) at UFL, the ratio of the number of moles of oxygen required to burn one mole of the mixture of fuel gas and 
inert gas to the number of moles of oxygen required to burn one mole of pure fuel gas equals the molar fraction of the fuel gas in the 
mixture (i.e., adding the inert gas to the fuel gas does not change the reaction mechanism at UFL); (K5) oxygen would react 
completely when combustion takes place at UFL; (K6) the heat release is the same for all limit mixtures at UFL. Under the 
 5
inert gas. According to this assumption, the heat released for the blended gas could be estimated from the heat of reaction of pure 
hydrocarbon. This assumption is popular for those who estimates the flammability limits from the calculated adiabatic flame 
temperatures in the literature [9-10]. However, although this assumption is popular in the literature, experimental results do show that 
the stoichiometry of a combustion reaction occurring at both the upper and lower flammability limits might change in the presence of 
an inert gas. The change in the stoichiometry of a combustion reaction at these two flammability limits could be easily understood 
from the fact that the range of concentrations between the upper flammability limit and lower flammability limit would considerably 
narrow down and finally converge to a point, if inert gas was added to the hydrocarbon/oxidant mixture. This convergent point is 
usually known as the inertization point. It is widely accepted that the lean reactant of a combustion reaction occurring at UFL is 
different from that occurring at LFL; therefore, the stoichiometry of a combustion reaction must change by adding inert gas as these 
two limits will finally converge to a point. However, it is obvious that assumption U2 will hold if the concentration of the inert gas is 
low. 
As we know, a combustion reaction would continue only if the heat released by the combustion reaction can raise the 
temperature of the unburned materials to beyond the energy threshold of the combustion reaction; and this energy threshold was 
usually expressed in the form of an adiabatic temperature rise. The energy released at the flammability limit is deemed to be the one 
just sufficient to make the unburned materials reach this energy threshold [3, 9-10]. Because the inert gas is not involved in the kinetics 
of a combustion reaction, it seems reasonable to assume that this energy threshold (i.e. the adiabatic temperature rise) does not 
change by adding the inert gas. This is the reason why assumption U3 is adopted in this study. 
 
2.2 Derivation of the upper flammability limit 
As a flammable material will not undergo complete combustion at UFL, we assume that c mole CO can be obtained by burning 
one mole of the hydrocarbon material ( ba HC ). Thus, the stoichiometry of the combustion reaction occurring at UFL is expressed as 
follows. 
 ( )chbcaccba Δ−=ΔΗ+−+→−++ OH2CO)(COO)24(HC 222ba  (5) 
where ( )chΔ−  is the heat of reaction for burning one mole of hydrocarbon according to the stoichiometry shown in equation 
(5). For brevity in notation, the following notations are defined in this subsection:

Now, let us consider the case of burning one mole of the total mixture at UFL. Based on assumptions U1 and U2, we can list the 
number of moles of all the reactants and products before and after the combustion reaction. Before the combustion, there are U  
moles of hydrocarbon, xU  moles of blended gas, )( UxU − moles of inert nitrogen, and xU−1  moles of air. Because oxygen

not contained in the predictive values for adiabatic temperature ranging 1000 K to 1600 K, although they are close to the predicted 
values. It was believed by us that such a deviation comes from the violation of assumption U2.

As the known deviations between the theoretical value and experimental value, it is thus recommended that the value of Uφ  
had better be determined from the experiment data for practical applications. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The development of reliable predictive methods for estimating the upper flammability limit of combustible gas would reduce 
significantly the amount of experimental data required for a complete flammability characterization. In this study, a theoretical model 
for predicting the upper flammability limit of pure hydrocarbon diluted with nitrogen was developed. The main assumptions in 
developing the theoretical models include: 
(U1) the oxygen reacts completely at UFL. 
(U2) the stoichiometric relation of a combustion reaction occurring at UFL does not change by the presence of inert gas. 
(U3) the adiabatic temperature rises are the same for all limit mixture at UFL. 
With aforementioned assumptions, it was derived analytically that there is a linear relationship between the reciprocal of the 
upper flammability limit and the reciprocal of the molar fraction of hydrocarbon in a mixture composed of hydrocarbon and nitrogen. 
Experimental data reported in the literature, which include the cases of methane, propane, ethylene and propylene, are then used to 
examine these theoretical linear relationships. The coefficients of determination for these four case studies are all greater than 0.996. 
Thus, the proposed model is positively supported by these experimental results. 
The only parameter in the theoretical model is the slope of the theoretical line. Because the burning conditions of a combustion 
reaction occurring at flammability limits might somewhat deviate from our assumptions, the slope obtained from theoretical 
calculation and the slope obtained from regression on experiment data do not match each other very well. Thus, it is recommended 
determining this parameter from experimental data to elevate the precision of prediction. As the proposed theoretical model is a 
straight line passing through the origin, it needs the least number of experimental data to construct a reliable estimate.
