e-beam lithography, dry etching, selective wet 
etching, and planarization techniques, with disk 
diameter down to 10 μm. The etching process is 
carefully optimized to achieve smooth and 
vertical sidewalls. The devices are measured at 
various temperatures from 78 K to 300 K. L-I 
curves and emission spectra are recorded. The 
quantum-well emission peak at room 
temperature is at 1520 nm. 
 
2. Sample structure and device fabrication  
 
In this work, we use samples consisting of 
five In0.5Ga0.5As QDs layers with 10 nm-thick 
GaAs spacers and AlGaAs as cladding layers, 
grown on GaAs substrate. First we deposit a thin 
SiO2 layer by PECVD on the sample surface. 
The microdisk patterns are defined by 
electron-beam lithography on the SiO2 layer. The 
circular patterns are transferred to the SiO2 layer 
by reactive ion etching (RIE). And then, the 
circular SiO2 patterns are used as the etching 
mask for the following two-step wet etching 
processes. The SEM image of the fabricated 
microdisk cavity is shown in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 
For the fabrication of current-injection 
InGaAsP quantum-well microdisk lasers, we use 
multiple quantum wells (MQW) grown on InP 
substrate by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) as 
active layers. The thicknesses of quantum wells 
and barriers are 6 nm and 20 nm, respectively. 
The number of quantum wells is five. First, we 
use PECVD to deposit SiO2 and use e-beam 
lithography to define the disk pattern with 
diameter of 10 m.  Then, we use reactive ion 
etching (RIE) to transfer the pattern to the SiO2 
layer. Then we use inductively coupling plasma 
reactive ion etching (ICPRIE) to etch down 
along the SiO2 mask and form a pillar. To ensure 
the sidewall verticality and smoothness, the 
etching parameters were optimized. After the 
etching process, a double-disk structure is 
formed, as shown Fig. 2. The upper disk is the 
contact layer for current injection and the lower 
disk is the active layer which supports WGMs 
circulating around the disk periphery.

structure on InP with disk diameter 10 m. 
 
In order to have good metal contact for 
current injection, a planarization process is 
introduced. We use benzocyclobutene 
(BCB)-based polymer[9] for this purpose. We 
spin BCB polymer first and then etch the BCB 
film down to the upper disk to form a planar 
structure. The standard metallization process on 
both p- and n- sides, sample grinding, and rapid 
thermal annealing are then carried out to form 
good ohmic contact and hence to lower the series 
resistance. 
 
3. Measurement results and discussions 
 
For the optical investigations, the microdisk 
cavities are excited by optical pumping using a 
795 nm Ti:Sapphire mode-locked laser with 
repetition rate of 76 MHz and pulse width of 150 
fs. The measurements are performed at 78 K. 
Using a typical μ-PL (photoluminescence) setup 
which focuses the excitation beam and collects 
the luminescence by the same objective lens, the 
spectra are analyzed by a monochromator with a 
600-groove/mm grating, followed by a cooled

steadily with increasing injection current. The 
plot of light intensity versus injection current is 
in Fig. 5(b), and the threshold current is 
determined to be 25 μA. This very small 
threshold current is due to the high quality of 
microdisk cavity and very compact size of this 
type of lasers. This also promises very little 
power consumption. In order to determine the Q 
factor of these microdisk cavities, the spectral 
resolution is increased to record the lasing 
spectrum shown in Fig. 5(c). In our experiment, 
the smallest mode linewidth is 1.41 nm, 
corresponding to a Q factor of 1040 for the 
microdisk cavity[13]. Currently, the highest 
temperature at which our devices can show 
lasing behavior is 275 K as in Fig. 5(d).

injection of a 10 m microdisk at 78 K, (b) mode 
intensity vs current at 78 K with a threshold 
current of 25 A, (c) single-mode lasing 
spectrum at a current of 100 A at 78 K, (d) 
single-mode lasing spectrum at a current of 2.5 
mA at 275 K. 
 
    In summary, we demonstrated the 
enhancement of average spontaneous emission 
rate by a factor of 4.3 which is slightly higher 
than that reported in the literature. We also 
fabricated current-injection InGaAsP 
quantum-well microdisk lasers with smooth 
sidewall and good verticality. They demonstrate 
very low threshold current of 25 A and 
single-mode emission at 78 K. For these reasons, 
current-injection microdisk lasers have great 
potential as a light source in optical 
telecommunications.

出國參加會議報告 
會議名稱：2010 International Conference On Nanoscience and Nanotechnology  
(ICONN 2010) 
時間：2010/2/22-26 
地點：Sydney, Australia 
出席者：毛明華（計畫主持人） 
 
開會行程與心得： 
此會議為澳洲研究委員會（Australian Research Council）所主辦之大型國際
會議，在雪梨舉行，有七個 symposia，會議主題的範圍涵蓋：奈米光子、奈米電
子、奈米生醫、奈米材料、奈米計算、奈米製造以及奈米科技對環境衝擊等，既
有材料的研究，也有元件應用、工業製造等議題，十分廣泛。其中跟我們實驗室
研究相關的奈米結構與光電元件方面的論文不少，值得參考、交流。 
此次會議中，本人口頭發表了一篇關於砷化鎵微碟量子點雷射能夠單模操作
的論文，操作溫度可達 170K。報告後，有好幾位學者提出問題，討論關於如何
能夠進一步提升操作溫度等議題。在會議中，也積極觀摩其他相關研究團隊的成
果，譬如遇到探討量子點發光穩定性的研究團隊，對於如何透過成長條件的改變
以提升穩定性，交換彼此的心得。 
順道一提，由於澳幣匯率在過去一年大幅升值的四成以上，當地的物價對外
國人而言極為昂貴，因此頗有捉襟見肘之感，是參加此次會議美中不足的地方。
