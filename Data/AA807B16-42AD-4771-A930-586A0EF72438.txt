 Infrared (IR) detectors can be categorized as either photon or thermal detectors, 
determined by their response to electromagnetic radiation [1]. Photon detectors have 
characteristics of fast response and outstanding S/N ratio [2], although they must 
work with a cryogenic cooler, which restricts their operation temperature at switching 
bias current of 10 µA. They are defined as follows [10]:

2. Experiment Design 
 Vanadium oxy-triethoxide (Aldrich) was added to the solution and stirred for 24 
hours. The viscosity of the gel solutions was controlled around 1.08.1 ±  centipoises 
before spin coating to maintain a consistent film thickness. The vanadium oxide thin 
films were then calcined under reducing atmosphere (Ar/H2 5%) at 550℃ for 2 hours 
Nanoscope IIIa) operating in a tapping mode. The grain sizes and surface roughness 
were measured at five different locations in each specimen. The mean values of the 
grain size and surface roughness for cases (A) to (I) are summarized in Table 2. The 
plain VO2 film in case (A) has a grain size ranging from 20 to 40 nm, with a surface 
roughness of 2.26 nm. As the amount of silicon oxides increased, the grain size of the 
film tended to decrease. Associated with the particle shrinkage, an improvement in 
surface roughness was noticed in cases (B) and (C). With respect to the tungsten 
doped VO2 films, no significant changes in grain size or film roughness were found, 
compared to cases (D) and (H). In contrast to most cases, the shape of the particles 
from case (H), instead of growing isotropically, tended to grow elliptically, as shown 
in Figure 2. 
(2) Temperature-dependent electrical properties of VO2 composite films 
 Case (A) in Figure 3 shows the temperature-dependent electrical resistance of the 
undoped VO2 film. Accompanied with its phase transition temperature, which 
occurred at 70℃, its electrical resistance dropped from 26.04 KΩ to 1.09 KΩ. As the 
tungsten concentration increased, the onset temperature of the composite film tended 
to decrease. The phase transition temperature dropped to 20℃ with a tungsten mole 
ratio of 0.02, as shown in case (G). Apparently, the addition of tungsten atoms 
provided the vanadium crystalline more electrons in d-orbital, which strengthened the 
operational temperature range. Therefore, there is a trade-off between sensitivity and 
detectivity. 
(3) Figures of merit of VO2 composite films 
 Compared with the shapes of the thermal-resistance hysteresis loop of various 
V1-x-yWxSiyO2 films, only the cases of (G), (H) and (I) have a greater magnitude at in 
TCR and a switching temperature at room temperature. Therefore, further 
characterization of the figures of merit was implemented on these three cases. The 
responsivity was defined as the magnitude of a signal in response to the thermal 
radiation from a constant temperature black-body measured at various chopper 
frequencies. The responsivity for the three cases was plotted with respect to the 
chopper frequency, as shown in Figure 5. The curves show the increasing tendency 
with the frequency until they reach maximal values at 60 Hz. After the peak value, 
their responsivity dropped rapidly. In addition, case (G), which was only W doped, 
was found to have the highest responsivity values at most frequencies, compared with 
cases (H) and (I), where W and Si were commixed. The responsivity values measured 
at 30 Hz, frame frequency for infrared diction camera, were 2600 V/W for the three 
cases. 
 The noise equivalent power (NEP) for the three cases was plotted with various 
chopper frequencies, as shown in Figure 6. NEP represents the root-mean-square 
and the width of the hysteresis loop of V1-x-yWxSiyO2 thin films were also dominated 
by the Si and W dopants. For the cases of WX+/V4+ mixing ratio at 0.02, their 
switching temperature occurred at room temperature. Additionally, in the cases of 
SiY+/V4+ mixing ratio at 0.15, the thin composite films inherit a set of rather linear 
hysteresis loops. With regard to practical design considerations, films characterized by 
a linear hysteresis loop with tight bandwidth are well-suited for uncooled thermal 
detectors, due to their wider operating temperature and reduced sensitivity to 
environmental fluctuation. The responsivity and detectivity at room temperature were 
characterized over 2600 V/W and 9*106 cm Hz1/2/W for a 60 Hz of chopper frequency 
at 10 µA bias current. The higher responsivity and detectivity performance are 
expected if thin films are integrated into air-gap or suspended structures.
