Abstract 
This study developed a simple finite element model to simulate vehicle-bridge dynamic 
problems for the braking and acceleration of moving vehicles. In the meantime, we proposed the 
semi-theoretical solution to validate this finite element method. The most attraction of this model is 
that the theory and formulation are simple and can be added to dynamic finite element codes 
without difficulty. The numerical examples of this study indicate that the bridge longitudinal 
response is more sensitive than the bridge vertical response when the vehicle braking or 
acceleration is active, especially for higher piers. 
Additionally, the effect of train-induced vibration on bridges and soil is a complex problem; 
one of the most feasible methods to solve this problem is through in-situ experiments. This study is 
to investigate the pattern of ground vibration caused by moving trains through a number of field 
measurements at various speeds. The experimental results indicate that the frequency-domain 
vibration at the dominant-frequencies (nV/L) is significantly large not only in the vertical direction 
but also in the horizontal directions. Moreover, except when there is resonance, the vibration at the 
dominant frequencies increases proportionally with the train speed. 
In the last chapter, a time-domain finite element analyses are performed to investigate the 
behavior of the vehicle-induced building vibration. The effects and relationships among road 
irregularities, truck speeds, truck natural frequencies and building natural frequencies were all 
investigated in this study. Finally, the numerical results indicate that the resonance at the first 
building natural frequency is the most serious, even when shear walls or thick slabs are used to 
reinforce the building. To reduce building vibrations generated from adjacent moving trucks, the 
road roughness should be as small as possible. 
Keywords: finite element method, vehicle, bridge, building, vibration, and dominant-frequency.

 Chapter 1. Introduction 
Recently, people pay much attention to the ground vibration and noise, such as the floor or 
window shake during passing a heavy truck. Moreover, for some vibrations that cannot be sensed 
by human, those vibrations may harm the surgery operation or high-tech product. In our former 
study, the field measurement and finite element result indicate that a suitable mat foundation can 
significantly reduce the horizontal vibration transformed from soil but cannot reduce low-frequency 
vertical vibration. However, the wave transition pattern in the building is still rear in the literature. 
In addition, ground vibrations induced by road traffic are a major environmental issue especially for 
near-by hospitals or high-tech industries, since vibration transmitted from road traffic may harm 
surgery operations or high-tech product. Moreover, large vibration also makes it uncomfortable for 
human. Thus, predicting the response of buildings induced by road traffic vibration is more and 
more important. Hunaidi and Tremblay [1] performed measurements and analyses of building 
vibration induced by road traffic. Vibration levels were evaluated with reference to human 
annoyance and the potential for building damage using existing standards. Maeda et al. [2] recorded 
the road traffic-induced building vibration continuously for 24 h outside and inside the building. 
Several alternative objective methods of quantifying the severity of exposures to whole-body road 
traffic-induced building vibration were used. Clemente and Rinaldis [3] analyzed the traffic-induced 
vibrations in the basement of the building. Wave propagation in the soil around the building in 
presence of the anti-vibration paving was compared with that in absence of the anti-vibration paving. 
Hao and Ang [4] presented an analytical method to estimate the power spectral densities of 
traffic-induced ground vibrations, which are assumed to consist of primarily Rayleigh waves 
induced by moving forces and propagating along the surface of an elastic homogeneous half-space. 
Hao et al. [5] presented traffic-induced ground vibrations measured at four soil sites. Their 
characteristics in terms of the site conditions and distance to road center were discussed. Lombaert 
et al. [6] deals with the numerical modeling of free field traffic-induced vibrations during the 
passage of a vehicle on an uneven road, which subjects the vehicle to vertical oscillations that cause 
dynamic axle loads and vibrations. Lombaert and Degrande [7] validated a numerical model for the 
prediction of traffic-induced vibrations using experiments. The vibrations in the free field, 
generated by the passage of a vehicle on an uneven road, were predicted. Crispino and D'apuzzo [8] 
described the measurements of road traffic-induced vibrations in a building. The measurements 
have been related to vehicle type and speed and have been compared with values obtained by a 
modified prediction model. Lombaert et al. [9] dealed with the influence of the soil stratification on 
the free field vibrations generated by the passage of a vehicle on an uneven road. A two-stage 
solution procedure was applied for the numerical prediction of the free field traffic-induced 
vibrations. Clouteau et al. [10] computed free field vibrations induced by train or road traffic, the 
excitation being either deterministic or stochastic. Schevenels et al. [11] describes the influence of 
seasonal variations of the ground water table on free field traffic-induced vibrations. The passage of 
a truck on two types of road unevenness is considered. Pyl et al. [12,13] focused on the coupling of 
a validated source model for free field traffic-induced vibrations to a receiver model that enables 
one to predict the response of buildings. 
 
In this investigation, we first developed a simple finite element model to simulate 
vehicle-bridge dynamic problems for the braking and acceleration of moving vehicles. In the 
meantime, we proposed the semi-theoretical solution to validate this finite element method. As we 
know, this type of validation is limited in the literature. The most attraction of this model is that the 
theory and formulation are simple and can be added to dynamic finite element codes without 
difficulty. Moreover, very complicated vehicles can be appropriately modeled using this proposed

 Chapter 2. A finite element model of vehicle-bridge interaction considering braking and 
acceleration 
This chapter develops a finite element scheme to analyze vehicle-bridge dynamic responses 
due to vehicle braking and acceleration. In this model, an assumption is that the averaged vehicle 
acceleration at current time is known, so absolute vehicle displacements can be changed to relative 
vehicle displacements. Thus, the inertia force at the center of each vehicle mass can be generated. 
This scheme produces a linear and small displacement analysis. In the meantime, the 
semi-theoretical solution of a two-axle vehicle moving on a bridge was generated with the 
acceleration effect. Then, this scheme was used to validate the proposed finite element model with 
almost identical agreement. The most attraction of this model is that the theory and formulation are 
simple and can be added to standard dynamic finite element codes without difficulty.

Fig. 2-1 Two-axle vehicle model with vertical and horizontal spring-dampers 
 
The main purpose of this section is to evaluate a semi-theoretical solution to validate the finite 
element method mentioned in Section 2.3. Fryba [13] generated the formulations of a two-axle 
vehicle moving on a simply supported beam loaded in the gravity direction (z direction). This study 
added the horizontal (x direction) spring and damper into Fryba’s solution so that the braking and 
acceleration could be included. In this chapter, the x direction is the bridge longitudinal direction 
and the z direction is the gravity direction. Since, we solved the current equations using numerical 
methods, the bridge is not necessary to be simply supported. Figure 2-1 shows a two-axle vehicle 
with 7 degrees of freedom including rigid mass rotation ( φ ), rigid mass, wheel 1 and wheel 2 
displacements (v3, v1 and v2) in the z direction and those (u3, u1 and u2) in the x direction. The 
bridge surface where vehicles move is assumed in the x direction with a length of L. In the intervals

Equation (2-14) can be used to calculate the dynamic response of the two-axle vehicle, in 
which only the displacements (u(xi,t) and v(xi,t)) at wheels 1 and 2 of the force terms R1, R2, R1x 
and R2x are required from the bridge. For the bridge structure, these forces are applied to the current 
locations of wheels 1 and 2 in x and z directions. If these forces are known, the bridge structural 
analysis is a linear dynamic problem, which can be accurately solved using a traditional Newmark 
finite element method. Since these forces and displacements u1, u2, v1 and v2 are coupled together, 
we used following procedures to solve this bridge-vehicle problem. 
(1) Find R1, R2, R1x and R2x using the displacements of the last time step. 
(2) Solve Eq. (2-14) at the current time step using the Newmark method. 
(3) Solve the bridge dynamic analysis using the Newmark finite element method. 
(4) If Eps≦0.0001, the solution is convergent, and go to Step (1) for the next time step.

 The above equation can solve the vehicle dynamic response due to the vehicle acceleration. To 
solve the bridge dynamic response, the contact forces at wheels 1 and 2 in the x direction need to be 
modified as follows:

Replacing and by x1R x2R x1R and x2R  for the friction forces on the bridge structure, one can 
solve the bridge dynamic response due to the vehicle acceleration. 
 
2.3 Finite element solution 
Moving vehicles contain car bodies, bogies, wheel-axis sets, springs and dampers, which are 
modeled as the combination of moving wheel elements, spring-damper elements, lumped mass and 
rigid links. The vehicle is assumed to move in the X direction (road direction), the vertical direction 
is in the Z direction and the Y direction is perpendicular to the road. If vehicles move in other 
directions, a transformation should be used.

The moving wheel element contains a stiffness kr to model the elastic layer between the road

direction. The element includes a wheel node and a number of target nodes. The current wheel 
position is known, so the two target nodes where the wheel node is located between them can be 
found. If the two target nodes and the wheel node are nodes 1,3 and 2 respectively, the stiffness of 
this 3-node element for the nodal displacements (X1, 1θ , X2, X3, 3θ ) is

where [I] is the n by n unit matrix, [0]1 and [0]2 are zero matrices and [D] is obtained from Eq.

freedom at the master node, and two extra-degrees of freedom {MM} in Eq. (2-30) are contained at 
the last two degrees of freedom of the new matrix [SM]. Usually, an element contains parts of slave 
and parts of normal degrees of freedom. We can use Eq. (2-31) to do the transformation for each 
slave degree of freedom successfully. 
 
2.3.4 Braking and acceleration 
The assumptions are the same as those of Section 2.2, all the displacements, velocities and 
accelerations at vehicles in the motion (X) direction are relative to current averaged displacement, 
velocity and acceleration (similar in Eq.s (2-16)-(2-18)). For vehicles, the stiffness and damping 
forces are null for the averaged vehicle displacement and velocity, so the unknown terms change to 
the relative displacement and velocity. The mass forces due to the averaged vehicle acceleration in 
the motion direction can be calculated explicitly as inertia forces (masses multiplying averaged 
vehicle acceleration). Thus, all the mass locations at vehicles are subjected to inertia forces in the 
negative acceleration direction. After the above procedure, wheel element stiffness matrices are 
added to the finite element model. Since there are wheel elements connecting vehicles and bridges, 
the contact forces between them will be calculated automatically, so the applied forces (Eq.s (2-21) 
and (2-22)) subjected to bridges are not required. The above procedures produce a linear 
small-displacement finite element analysis for the vehicle-bridge dynamic problem. The advantage 
of this model is that the formulation is simple. The disadvantage is that the mass, damping and 
stiffness matrices vary with wheel position, which needs to be solved at each time step. This 
condition is not serious, since for a problem with large degrees of freedom the efficient conjugate 
gradient method [14] is often used to solve the matrix equation. At this time, solving a new matrix 
equation at each time step is necessary. This moving vehicle dynamic analysis with large degrees of 
freedom can be found in our previous investigations [15-17].

2.5 Conclusions 
This chapter developed a finite element scheme to calculate vehicle-bridge dynamic responses 
due to vehicle braking and acceleration. First, the semi-theoretical solution of a two-axle vehicle 
moving on a bridge was generated with the acceleration effect, and this scheme was used to validate 
the proposed finite element model. In the semi-theoretical scheme, springs and dampers in the 
motion direction were added into Fryba’s solution so that the braking and acceleration could be 
included. Since the bridge was solved using the traditional finite element method, this 
semi-theoretical scheme can work out the two-axle-vehicle-bridge dynamic problem with various 
bridge shapes. 
 
In the vehicle acceleration problem, we assume that the averaged vehicle acceleration at 
current time is known, so absolute vehicle displacements can be changed to relative vehicle 
displacements. Thus, the inertia force at the center of each vehicle mass can be generated. This 
scheme used into a traditional finite element method produces a linear and small displacement 
analysis. Numerical comparisons indicate that the results of the semi-theoretical and finite element 
analyses are almost identical. The most advantage of the proposed finite element model is that the 
theory and formulations are very simple with symmetric stiffness and damping matrices, so it can 
be added to a standard dynamic finite element codes easily. Moreover, very complicated vehicle 
models can be assembled using the proposed elements as simple as the traditional linear-elastic and 
small-deformation finite element method. 
 
The numerical examples of this chapter indicate that the bridge longitudinal response is more 
sensitive than the bridge vertical response when the vehicle braking or acceleration is active, 
especially for higher piers. The resonance may be invoked due to a series of vehicles, so only using 
steady-static results for vehicle braking or acceleration may produce large errors. The proposed 
finite element method can give a simple and accurate approach to calculate the effect of vehicle 
braking and acceleration.

that Eq.( 3-4) predicts the dominant frequencies precisely when the number of cars is larger than 3.

cars, they can still be predicted using Eq. (3-4) for more than 3 cars. Figure 3-1(b) shows the

3.2.2 Experiment Setup 
Field experiment contained four observation stations named 3-m, 50-m, 100-m, and 200-m, set 
up at distances of 3, 50, 100, and 200 m from the railroad centerline respectively. The velocity 
meters of each station contain three-direction measurements, which include two horizontal (X and 
Y) and a vertical (Z) direction. Since the vibration, presented as velocity, is often used as the 
international standard, (such as the 1/3 octave band for the semi-conductor industry) vibration 
velocities were used to represent experimental results. A computer system was used to record the 
velocity histories of the three stations with a sample rate of 512 Hz (512 measurements per second). 
The field measurements ran continuously for about eight hours per day, and then, computer 
software was used to pick up the 40-second data of the train passing the location. Two sets of the 
40-second ambient vibration data were also obtained 200 seconds before and after the running of 
each train. 
 
3.2.3 Arrangement of Experimental Data 
The arrangement of experimental data is explained as follows: 
(1) The 40-second vibration (yt(t)) recorded during the train passing a region was obtained first, and 
then two sets of 40-second ambient vibration (ya1(t) and ya2(t)), were recorded 200 seconds 
before and after of the train passing. 
(2) From the beginning of the 40-second data, the vibration data of 8 seconds was selected, and 
shifted 1 second to select another 8 seconds until the last time period was shorter than 8 seconds. 
Thus, there are 33 8-second measurements. Computer software was then used to analyze each 
8-second vibration by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain a number of the 
frequency-domain vibration data (yt(f)k, ya1(f)k, ya2(f)k, k=1,33). 
(3) For the vibrations measured while a train passed a region, the extreme values changing with 
each frequency (yt(f)) were obtained from the 33 frequency-domain vibration measurements 
(yt(f)k, k=1,33). For the ambient vibrations, the averaged values changing with each frequency 
 17
 wire-frame figures of the vertical vibration were investigated. These figures reveal that the 
vibration magnitude is approximately linearly proportional to the train speed. This condition is 
well explained in the previous section (Illustration of trainload characteristics), and Eq. (3-9) 
can be used to predict this train speed effect. 
(5) High-frequency vibration is damped faster than the low-frequency vibration. This condition can 
be clearly seen in the wire-frame figures in which the high-frequency vibration becomes 
gradually smaller as the distance of the observation station becomes larger. For example, the 
vibration of 6 to 8 V/L is still pronounced at the 3-m station, but it is much smaller at the 50-m 
station, and almost cannot be seen at the 200-m station. Ju (2004) used finite element analyses 
to indicate that the low-frequency ground vibration induced by moving trains is difficult to 
isolate. Only a suitable mat foundation can decrease the horizontal vibration, although it cannot 
decrease the low-frequency vertical vibration (Ju and Lin 2006). Thus, the low-frequency 
ground vibration in the vertical direction is more serious.

produces significant ground vibrations, which might affect the normal operation of precision 
instruments, such as hospital and precision production workshops. Thus, the main purpose of 
this chapter is to investigate the characteristics of the train-induced vibration through field 
experiments. A number of field experiments were performed to measure the vibration induced 
by moving trains at speeds ranging from 160 to 315 km/h. The experimental results indicate that 
the frequency-domain vibration at the dominant-frequencies (nV/L) is significantly large not 
only in the vertical direction but also in the horizontal directions, even though the trainload is 
mainly in the vertical direction. Moreover, except when there is resonance, the vibration at the 
dominant frequencies increases proportionally with the train speed. These experimental 
conclusions can be predicted by using two simple theoretical equations, the dominant frequency 
and influence factor equations, deduced from the trainload in the frequency domain. 
The experimental results also indicate that the high-frequency vibration, such as n≧6,  
attenuates faster than the low-frequency vibration. Thus, low-frequency ground vibration is 
more serious. This low-frequency train-induced vibration propagates through soil with the 
dominant frequencies of nV/L, and may cause resonance of the trainload and adjacent structures. 
Thus, to avoid resonance, the first several dominant train frequencies and the first natural 
frequencies of bridges or adjacent buildings should be as different as possible. 
 
 
 where r(X) is a function of the road or rail irregularity that will be further discussed in Section 
4.3.3, and X is the wheel location in the moving wheel direction (X axis). 
 
One could omit the interaction between the vehicle and the road, as the road is much stiffer 
than the vehicle. Thus, the dynamic loads could also have been calculated by considering the 
truck passing on a rigid, uneven road, which significantly simplifies the analysis, and gives a 
correct result in the case of road traffic. However, if one wants to know the ground vibration 
induced by the road traffic, the interaction between the vehicle and the road is still necessary.

 frequencies of the truck are 2.6 and 3.3 Hz, respectively. In the finite element model, each wheel 
set of the truck is modeled by three spring-damper elements in the X, Y, and Z directions, the

The location was the Tainan Science Park in southern Taiwan, which contains a soil profile 
of 10-m inorganic clays of low to medium plasticity, 40-m silty sands, and the rest is very hard 
sand. The Young's modulus of the surface soil is 0.75E5 kN/m2, and that of the soil more than 
50 m deep is 8E5 kN/m2. Linear interpolation was applied to determine the Young's modulus 
between these two depths. The mass density and Poisson’s ratio of the soil are 2 T/m3 and 0.48, 
respectively. The soil shear wave speeds are approximately 250 m/s for the 3-Hz wave. The two 
factors of Rayleigh damping ([Damping]=α[Mass]+β[Stiffness]) α and β for the soil 
equal 0.78/s and 3.7×10-4 s, respectively, which gives an approximately 2% damping ratio at 
frequencies of 4 Hz and 15 Hz. Shaker experiments were performed to measure the above soil 
damping using different load frequencies from 2 to 25 Hz, and the least-squares method [4-10] 
was used to find α and β by fitting the measured vibration data. An earlier experiment in 
reference [4-11] concentrated on frequencies from 2 to 25 Hz with a good estimation of the soil

 4.2.2 Finite element model 
 
 
Fig. 4-8 A typical 3D finite element mesh (1,336,592 nodes) 
 
The Newmark direct integration method and a consistent mass scheme were used to solve 
this problem with the solution scheme of the Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation (SSOR) 
preconditioned conjugated gradient method [4-11]. The finite element model is 498 m long, 429 
m wide, and 120 m deep with a maximum solid element size of 3 m. The soil and road are 
modeled by 8-node 3D solid elements, the truck is modeled by the moving wheel elements, and 
the five surfaces, except the top surface of the mesh, are modeled by the absorbing boundary 
condition [4-12], which avoids spurious reflections at the boundaries of the soil domain. The 
nearby building is modeled by 3D beam elements, and its floor slabs and retaining walls are 
modeled by assumed-strain shell elements. Nodes connected to the 3D beam and shell elements 
have six degrees of freedom, three translations, and three rotations. Other nodes have three 
translation degrees of freedom. Figure 4-8 shows a typical 3D finite element mesh, which 
contains 1,336,592 nodes. The time step length is 0.0135 seconds, and 2048 time steps were 
simulated. This time step is about one fifth of the 10-Hz wave period, so it is accurate enough to 
simulate waves lower than 10 Hz. The soil wavelength for the 10-Hz surface wave 
approximates to 22 m, which is about 7 times the maximum element size (3 m), so the finite 
element analysis should be accurate enough for wave frequencies lower than 10 Hz. However, 
waves higher than 10 Hz and lower than 30 Hz still contain more than two time steps and two 
maximum element sizes, so their references should be acceptable. 
Analyzing vibrations using the 1/3 octave band in the frequency domain has become an 
international standard in semi-conductor industries. Thus, this method, presented in decibels (dB) 
is utilized in this research. Table 4-5 briefly presents the recommended vibration guidelines 
[4-13]. A frequency-dependent dB and a total dB are used in the subsequent figures, and the 
calculation procedures can be found in [4-13,4-14].

measurements and the finite element analysis for truck speeds of 30 and 50 km/h 
 
4.3.2 Effect of the truck speed 
   The moving vehicle is the source of vibration, so its speed plays an important role in the 
vehicle-induced vibration. This section investigates the behavior of the building vibrations 
generated from an adjacent moving truck with speeds of 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90, and 110 km/h. 
The properties of the truck and soil were mentioned in Section 4.2.1, where the road center is 14 
m from the building edge, and the building analyzed is the third case, as shown in Table 4-3 and 
Fig. 4-7. The road irregularity is classified as very good, as the spectral roughness coefficient (A) 
is equal to 0.24× 10-6 m2/(m/cycle) (Table 4-3). Figure 4-10 shows the surface displacements of 
the finite element analysis for building case 3 under the truck speed of 70 km/h, in which the 
most obvious wavelength is about 80 m. The major soil wave in the figure is generated from the 
moving truck around its vertical natural frequencies (2.6 Hz and 3.3 Hz) with the approximate 
wavelengths of 90 m and 70 m. Figure 4-11 shows the finite element results, which indicate the 
following features: 
(1) In the Y and Z directions, when the truck speed increases, the building vibrations also 
increase. This is due to the increase in truck speed producing a larger power spectral density 
function  in equation (17) for a certain vibration frequency (f)f(Gr vibration). This vibration 
frequency (fvibration) is equal to fV, where f is the frequency per unit length in equation (4-17), 
and V is the truck speed. If the vibration frequency (fvibration) is not changed, a larger V 
should come with a smaller f, which produces a larger  from equation (4-17). 
Generally, a large power spectral density function causes large vehicle vibrations. The 
X-direction building vibration is the smallest, which approximately follows this rule. 
)f(Gr
(2) Figure 4-11 shows that the building vibration induced by a fast truck speed appears to have a 
limit. This is because the power spectral density function in equation (4-17) has a limit for f 
at 0.05 cycles/m. Moreover, a fast speed has a shorter duration time and may decrease 
vibrations near the resonance condition.

 vertical low-frequency vibrations. Road irregularity is the most influential factor in producing 
ground vibrations induced by moving vehicles. Thus, to decrease truck-induced vibrations, the 
road surface should be as smooth as possible.

4.3.4 Effect of building structures 
   This section studies truck-induced vibrations due to the effect of building structures. Shear 
walls and thicker floor slabs can increase the building stiffness, so they are often used to reduce 
building vibrations. Thus, finite element analyses were performed for the three building (Table 
4-3) with a truck speed of 50 km/h and the conditions of (1) 35cm-thick shear walls constructed 
around the building (shear-wall case), and (2) the thickness of all 12 cm floor slabs replaced by 
100 cm ones (thick-slab case). Figure 4-13 shows the particle frequency-dependent velocity dB 
in the Y and Z directions at the roof, and Fig. 4-14 shows the maximum total particle velocity 
dB changing with floor levels. The two figures indicate the following features: 
(1) Figure 4-13 shows that the Y- and Z-direction vibrations are concentrated at the frequencies 
between 2 to 5 Hz, which is caused by the truck vibrating at its vertical natural frequencies 
(2.6 Hz and 3.3 Hz) (see Fig. 4-10). Because the building foundation slab can reduce 
high-frequency vibrations [4-15], the vibrations with frequencies higher than 10 Hz in the 
Y-direction and 20 Hz in the Z-direction are relatively small, so they are not shown in the 
figure. The peaks of Z-direction vibrations between 7 to 20 Hz are due to the first vertical 
natural frequency of buildings. This figure further indicates that truck vertical natural 
frequencies play an import role in vehicle-induced vibration.  
(2) For the in-plane (X- and Y-directions) vibrations of building case 1, the thick-slab case has 
the smallest vibrations, and the shear-wall case has the largest. This is because the first and 
second in-plane natural frequencies of the thick-slab case are 1.5 and 5.4 Hz, respectively, 
which is very different from the truck’s vertical frequencies of 2.6 and 3.3 Hz. However, the 
first in-plane natural frequency of the shear-wall case is 2.9 Hz, which is close to the first 
vertical natural frequency of the truck, so resonance causes a large vibration of the 
shear-wall building and demonstrates a first-mode vibration pattern, as shown in Fig. 4-14. 
(3) For the in-plane vibrations of building case 2, the normal and thick-slab cases have smaller 
vibrations, and the shear-wall case has the largest. The reason is similar to the above 
discussed; the first and second in-plane natural frequencies of the thick-slab case are very 
different from the truck’s vertical frequencies, but the first in-plane natural frequency of the 
shear-wall case is 2.5 Hz, which is very close to the first vertical natural frequency of the 
truck, so resonance causes the building vibration to be the largest and also demonstrates a 
first-mode vibration pattern, as shown in Fig. 4-14.  
(4) For the in-plane vibrations of building case 3, Figure 4-14 shows that the normal case has

4.4 Conclusions 
This study developed a finite element method to simulate complicated 3D vehicles moving 
on a road, where car bodies, bogies, wheel-axis sets, springs, and dampers are modeled by 
assembling moving wheel elements, spring-damper elements, lumped masses, and rigid links. 
The theory and formulations of this vehicle model are simple and can be added to standard 
dynamic finite element codes without difficulty. Fryba’s solution of a simply supported beam 
subjected to a moving two-axle system was analyzed to validate this finite element model. The 
simulations, including road irregularities and changing the mesh of solid elements, are almost 
identical for the two schemes, which means that the proposed finite element model of moving
