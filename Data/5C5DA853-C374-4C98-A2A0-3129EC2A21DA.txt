I. INTRODUCTION 
     In the last years, the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) phenomenon in 
half-metal oxide manganite compounds has been intensively studied [1-6]. Besides, 
the prospect of technological applications, manganites show a variety of intriguing 
physical phenomena. Due to their electrical, transport, and magnetic properties, 
manganites are a very interesting model material for both the investigation of 
magnetism and in view of possible application in innovative magnetic devices. 
Moreover, doped pervoskite manganites R1-xAxMnO3, where part of the trivalent 
rare-earth ions R3+ are replaced by divalent alkaline-earth metal ions A2+ have been 
studied intensively the last years, since they show interesting metal-insulator 
transition [7-8]. Epitaxial thin films offer a large variety of opportunities to explore 
and to manipulate the properties of the doped manganites [9-10]. Furthermore, thin 
film structure is required for the envisaged device applications. In several experiments 
with ultra thin single film or manganite-insulator multilayers a loss in magnetic 
moment, a drop in the metal to insulator transition temperature and the Curie 
temperature, and an increase in resistivity are observed. It is also well known that 
strain due to lattice mismatch, and lattice distortions result from the thickness of film 
can strong affect the properties of manganite thin films [11]. Moreover, processes 
parameters are also reported to affect the magnetic and transport properties of the 
manganites even the manganites have a fixed doping level [12-15]. Recently, some 
novel properties were observed in CMR thin films [16], indicating that strain effect 
can be utilize to tailor or optimize the magnetic and transport properties of CMR thin 
films, although a thorough understanding of strain effect is still unavailable and 
challenging. Recently, (La,Ba)MnO3 (LBMO) manganite receives much attention due 
to its anomalous magnetic properties [17]. A detailed study of the strained LBMO thin 
film may help us go further in wholly understanding strain effect and further evaluate 
its application in devices. In this work, a systematic investigation of magnetic 
properties in the variety of strained LBMO thin films by means of 
LBMO/LaNiO3(LNO) asymmetric heterostructue was performed. The LNO was used 
because it has satisfactory crystallographic compatibility for heteroepitaxial growth of 
a perovskite layer [18]; Moreover, LNO is paramagnetic. The effect of modulation 
length and growth temperature on the strain state in the heterostructure was 
systemically investigated. The correlation between the strain size and the 
magnetization characterization of the heterostructure was initially reported.  
II. EXPERIMENTS  
In order to investigate strain effect on the physical properties of manganites, the 
heterostrctures with (LBMOm/LNOn)12 in which m=8 nm and n= 2, 4 nm were 
adopted in this work. Single crystal SrTiO3 (STO) with (100)-orientation was used as 
 6
lattice parameter c of the LBMO/LNO heterostructures is larger than the weighted 
mean of the lattice parameter c of unstrained LBMO and LNO films (horizontal lines) 
suggesting an elongation of the average c-axis lattice of the heterostructure along 
[00L] through heteroepitaxial strain in the heterostructure. The average c-axis lattice 
constant of the heterostructure grown at 700oC is not determined because of the loss 
of well-layered structure herein. The equation of (c-cw)/cw was used to further 
quantify the degree of the elongation of the average c-axis length in the 
heterostructure due to the strain effect. The c is the average c-axis length of the 
heterostructure and it can be determined from the XRD patterns; the cw is the 
weighted mean of the lattice parameter c of unstrained LBMO and LNO films. From 
Fig. 3, the degree of the elongation of the average c-axis length of the LBMO-8 
nm/LNO-4 nm is larger than that of the LBMO-8 nm/LNO-2 nm at a given growth 
temperature. The thicker LNO spacer (4 nm) has better performance in straining the 
LBMO layers herein. Moreover, higher growth temperature shows the better strain 
efficiency in the heterostructure. This may result from the larger grain size in the 
heterostructure when the film was grown at a higher temperature; the large grain 
exhibits better straining of the manganite in the heterostructure has also been reported 
[20]. The results of XRD experiments clearly demonstrate that the different degrees of 
lattice distortion were induced from lattice strain among these heterostructures. The 
LBMO-8 nm/LNO-4 nm heterostructure grown at 600oC shows the largest elongation 
of average c-axis length among all the samples. This means that the LBMO-8 
nm/LNO-4 nm heterostructure grown at 600oC has longest Mn-O bond length in the 
manganese sublayers (along c-axis) and the LBMO-8 nm/LNO-2 nm heterostructure 
grown at 400oC exhibits the narrowest Mn-O bond length distribution along c-axis. 
Strain in the thin film structure may contribute significantly to the distortion of MnO6 
orchestra in the manganese films and further affect the physical properties of the 
manganites [21].    
An epitaxial relationship between the manganite film and the 
non-ferromagnetic layer is key factor to investigate the strain effect on the manganite 
films. The epitaxy between the LBMO and LNO sublayers in the heterostructure is 
demonstrated by the in-plane orientation with respect to the major axes {102} of the 
STO substrate. The azimuthal (102) diffraction patterns of the heterostructure with 8 
nm-thick LBMO and 4 nm-thick LNO grown at 400 and 600oC are shown in Fig.4. 
No other peaks are observed in the intervals between the four peaks, indicating the 
well epitaxial nature between the LBNO and LNO sublayers grown on a STO 
substrate. The result of XRD Phi-scans demonstrates that the use of LNO buffer 
ensures the hereostructure remains epitaxial nature in a wide range of growth 
temperature.  
 8
show dense and smooth film surface. The AFM experimental results reveal that the 
LNO buffer effectively prohibits the roughening of the surface of the LBMO sublayer 
when the heterostructure is grown at 400-600oC. Comparatively, the LBMO-8 
nm/LNO-2 nm heterostructures have smoother film surface than that of the LBMO-8 
nm/LNO-4 nmheterostructures at a given temperature. The degree of the increase of 
surface roughness due to the LNO spacer thickness is small with respect to the effect 
of growth temperature. From the viewpoint of strain energy, the modulation lengths of 
the heterostructures are below the critical value herein; the growth temperature might 
play an important role in dominating the roughness of the film surface.  
A superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer was used to 
measure the magnetization of the samples. Figure 8(a) displays the temperature 
dependence of the magnetization for the heterostructures with different modulation 
lengths and grown at various temperatures. The magnetization of the heterostructures 
was normalized to the value at 10K. All the magnetization vs. temperature curves 
show that the heterostructures are ferromagnetic coupling below the Curie 
temperature. The Curie temperature of the heterostructures was determined from the 
magnetization curves. A low growth temperature results in a high Curie temperature 
of the heterostructures having the same modulation length (Fig. 8(b)). Moreover, the 
heterostructure has a lower Curie temperature for thicker LNO spacer. For growth 
temperature effect, the Curie temperature of the LBMO-8 nm/LNO-2 nm 
heterostructures decreased from 241 to 167K as the growth temperature increased 
from 400 to 600oC. A reduction of 30% in the Curie temperature was observed for the 
LBMO-8 nm/LNO-4 nm heterostructures. Furthermore, a drop of 20% in the Curie 
temperature was observed for the LBMO-8 nm/LNO-2 nm heterostructures in the 
temperature range of 400-600oC. The LBMO-8 nm/LNO-4 nm heterostructure grown 
at 600oC has the lowest Curie temperature of 167K, and that of the LBMO-8 
nm/LNO-2 nm heterostructure grown at 400oC is 252K which is the highest value 
among all the samples. Figure 9 shows the strain dependence of the Curie temperature 
for the heterostructures. It is clear that the higher lattice strain in the heterostructure 
incurs a lower Curie temperature in the heterostructure. Notably, the LNO space is a 
non-ferromagnetic material. The contribution of magnetization of the heterostructure 
is from the LBMO sublayers. The in-plane compressive strain of the LBMO sublayer 
in the heterostructure due to the insertion of the LNO spacer induces a measurable 
static anisotropic distortion of the MnO6 octahedra in the LBMO sulayers, with 
splitting of the in-plane and out-of-plane Mn-O bond lengths. This distortion may lead 
to an increase of the splitting of the eg levels tending to localize the charge carriers 
and explains the decrease of the temperature of ferromagnetic transition observed in 
thin films with respect to the bulk material [23]. In this work, the oxygen content of 
 10
values of Curie temperature and strain state of the heterostructures reflects that 
in-plane compressive strain in the ferromagnetic sublayers plays a significant factor to 
influence the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic LBMO sublayers. This will be a 
good reference for design of novel devices based on the manganites.
