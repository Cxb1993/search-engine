at the transmitter, our objective is to minimize the 
overall transmit power of the system under the 
constraint of a bit rate for each user while meeting 
the target BER. 
   Throughout the paper, we will use the following 
notations. Lower case and bold upper letters denote 
column vectors and matrices, respectively; T)(⋅ and 
H)(⋅ are transpose and Hermitian transpose, 
respectively; 
F
⋅  stands for the Frobenius norm. 
The rest of the report is organized as follows. Section 
II describes the system model and objective. A near 
optimal adaptive allocation algorithm for multiuser 
MIMO-OFDM transmission based on equivalent CSI 
with 2-D beamforming is derived in section III. In 
section IV, simulation results and some issues are 
presented. Finally, we make conclusions in section V. 
II. System Model and Problem Formulation 
In this project, we deal with a downlink 
adaptive multiuser MIMO-OFDM system equipped 
with cN subcarriers, tN transmit antennas at base 
station and rN  receive antennas for each user over 
a frequency-selective fading environment. Herein, 
we propose a novel algorithm according to this 
baseband system model, which is shown in Figure 1. 
OFDM subcarriers are deployed with the 
adaptive 2-D coder-beamformer which combines 
Alamouti’s space time block coding (STBC) [4] with 
transmit beamforming. For the 2-D 
coder-beamformer per subcarrier, it is necessary to 
pair two consecutive OFDM symbols to form one 
space-time-coded OFDM block. Because of 
frequency selective fading, different subcarriers will 
experience different attenuation through frequency 
domain interleaver. Thus, besides adapting 2-D 
coder-beamformers’ related parameters on each 
subcarrier, the total transmit power also should be 
allocated to different subcarriers based on the 
available CSI of each user at the transmitter.  
Let’s denote n the index of the space-time 
coded OFDM blocks, and k  is the subcarrier index, 
},...,2,1{ cNk ∈ ; m  is the user index, 
},...,2,1{ Mm∈ ; tN  and rN  are the numbers 
of transmit and receive antennas, respectively. For 
each STBC OFDM block time slot n , the input of 
each 2-D coder-beamformer entails two symbols [ ]mkns ;;1  and [ ]mkns ;;2 . These two 
symbols will be space-time coded, power-loaded, 
and multiplexed by the 2-D beamformer to generate 
a 2×tN  space-time matrix as

III. Enhanced Adaptive Allocation Algorithm 
for Multiuser MIMO-OFDM with 2-D 
Beamforming 
It is well-known that beamforming is one of the 
promising methods in terms of maximizing the 
received SNRs. Herein, we want to minimize the 
total tansmit power. Now, we shall concentrate our 
attention on the 2-D coder-beamformers of 
transmitter at base station. Considering the eigen 
decomposition for the “apparent channel” of a 
particular user.

   As the equivalent channels ];[ mkheqv  in (4) 
have been determined correctly at base station, we 
will develop our adaptive allocation algorithm at 
transmitter; the novel heuristic algorithm 
simultaneously determines the subcarrier, bit, and 
power allocation by enhanceing the suboptimal 
algorithm for subcarrier allocation in [1]. The 
proposed algorithm offers better performance than 
Wang’s algorithm in [1] under the same conditions. 
The Wang’s Subcarrier Allocation (WSA) algorithm 
is a two-step heuristic method, which assign 
subcarriers to users. It employs a constructive 
assignment to set up an initial point (i.e. Constructive 
Initial Assignment, CIA) [1], [5] and adopts the 
iterative improvement to reach a sub-optimal point.  
   Referring to the WSA algorithm, mS  is 
predetermined and set to a constant value. However, 
the WSA algorithm did not address how to obtain 
this number. Actually, mS  should be adjusted 
adaptively to conform with mobile channel 
variations. We believe the required total transmit 
power can be further reduced if mS  is updated 
adaptively in the allocation process. 
  In the CIA step, we assign the number of 
subcarriers to a user in proportion to the required 
data rate in our proposed dynamic channel 
assignment extension (DCA-EXT) algorithm. For 
example, if there are four users, twenty subcarriers, 
and 4321 ::: RRRR 3:2:2:3= , we may 
initially set )6,4,4,6():::( 4321 =SSSS , we 
propose the DCA-EXT scheme by adding another 
power reduction factor. Instead of the subcarrier 
swapping between two users, we consider the 
operation that a subcarrier assigned to users i  at the 
CIA step is reallocated to user j  at the iteration 
improvement step. By this operation, user j  will 
obtain one more subcarrier to transmit data and user 
i  will be deducted one subcarrier from the previous 
assigned subcarriers. Note that the data rate 
requirement },{ ji RR  still has to be satisfied, and 
the original bit and transmit power loading should be 
adjusted within the assigned subcarriers for 
user i and j . It is known that any Dynamic Bits 
Assignment (DBA) [5], [6], [7] scheme in the single 
 6
2=tN  and 1=rN  is simulated. The 
performance of our proposed algorithm is compared 
with those of the “pure” CIA and WSA schemes. By 
setting the transmit power of FDMA-OFDM scheme 
in 3 users situation as the performance compared 
reference, figures 2 to 3 show the relative transmit 
power for various path losses difference among users 
(herein, 0 and 30 dB, respectively). It is obvious that 
our proposed ESA scheme always outperforms 
FDMA, CIA and WSA schemes. Figure 4 to 5 
exhibit the transmit power performance gains of the 
ESA scheme which compared with the WSA and 
FDMA, respectively, by varying the different 
numbers of users versus the path losses difference. 
Figure 4 shows that the power gains of the ESA 
scheme increase as the path losses difference 
becomes greater; the gain also increases while the 
number of the users increases.   
  On the other hand, we applied the DBA algorithm 
to the assigned subcarriers for each user after the 
iteration step of the proposed ESA algorithm. In 
Figure 6, the transmit power gain achieved by adding 
the DBA operation is pretty small in multiuser 
systems except the path losses difference exceed 
30dB. In figure 7, it reveals that the gain of ESA is 
better than WSA with DBA. This implies that the 
ESA scheme is very efficient. Therefore, the DBA 
step can be skipped without any significant 
degradation in performance. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this project, we propose a downlink adaptive 
multiuser MIMO-OFDM transmit scheme with three 
adaptations: adaptive subcarrier allocation among 
users, adaptive modulation modes through OFDM 
subcarriers, and adaptive power allocation for each 
user’s subcarriers. The simulation results show that 
our presented scheme provides better performance 
than the subcarrier allocation algorithm [1] and the 
FDMA-OFDM assignment, under various situations, 
especially when the SNR differences of users are 
significant.
