kinetics of isothermal and nonisothermal crystallization. The melting behavior of the 
specimens after isothermal and/or nonisothermal crystallization was investigated by 
DSC and temperature modulated DSC (TMDSC) at different heating rates. The 
reversing, total, and non-reversing heat flow curves were analyzed. The crystal 
conformations at various temperatures were examined by wide-angle X-ray diffracto- 
meter and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The morphology of co- 
polyesters before and/or after biodegradation was studied using PLM, scanning 
electron microscopy and/or atomic force microscopy. Lipase was used to biodegrade 
PBS-rich copolyesters, poly(butylene succinate-co-2-methyl-1,3-propylene succinate) 
(PBMPSu) and poly(butylene succinate-co-1,3-propylene succinate) (PBPSu). Novel 
copolyesters, PBMPSu 50/50 and PBPSu 50/50, were examined under various iso- 
thermal conditions. Additionally, mechanisms and kinetics of thermal degradation of 
PBS, PBMPSu 95/5 and 90/10 were studied using TGA and FTIR.

1. Introduction
Biodegradable materials can be degraded to CO2,
CH4, H2O, or other natural substances by the action
of enzymes and microorganisms. They offer viable
solutions to solve environmental pollution caused
by the worldwide disposal of used synthetic poly-
mers in the last several decades. Among biodegrad-
able polymers, aliphatic polyesters have received
considerable attention [1]. Poly(butylene succinate)
(PBSu) is a chemosynthetic polyester with a rela-
tively high melting temperature (Tm ! 113°C) and
favorable mechanical properties, which are compa-
rable with those of such widely used polymers as
polyethylene and polypropylene [2]. Moreover,
owing to the excellent processability of PBSu, it
can be processed using conventional equipment.
In general, the degree of crystallinity, spherulite
size and lamellar structure of aliphatic polyesters
affect their biodegradation rates, because biodegra-
dation initially occurs in the amorphous regions [3,
4]. The crystalline structure [5–9], and crystalliza-
tion and melting behavior [10–18] of PBSu have
been investigated extensively. PBSu has a relatively
low biodegradation rate because of its high crystal-
lization rate and high crystallinity. To promote the
physical properties, extend the application field,
and increase the biodegradability of PBSu, numer-
ous approaches have been used, such as physical
blending, copolymerization, or formation of com-
posites. With respect to copolymers, the degrada-
tion rates of PBSu can be increased by incorporat-
ing small amounts of various diols [19–24] or
                                                                                                    284

Abstract. Poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu), poly(2-methyl-1,3-propylene succinate) (PMPSu), and PBSu-rich copolyesters
were synthesized using an effective catalyst, titanium tetraisopropoxide. Measurements of intrinsic viscosity (1.20–
1.28 dl/g) and gel permeation chromatography demonstrated the success of the preparation of polyesters with high molec-
ular weights. The compositions of the copolyesters were determined in three approaches from 1H and 13C NMR (nuclear
magnetic resonance) analyses, and good agreement between the results was obtained. The distributions of the comonomers
were found to be random from the spectra of carbonyl carbon. Their thermal properties were elucidated using a differential
scanning calorimeter and a thermogravimetric analyzer. No marked difference exists among the thermal stabilities of these
polyesters. However, the window between the glass transition and the melting temperatures becomes narrower with the
increase in the concentration of 2-methyl-1,3-propylene succinate in the copolymers. Additionally, the cold crystallization
ability decreases considerably. Finally, PMPSu is an amorphous homopolymer. Wide-angle X-ray diffractograms of
isothermally crystallized copolyesters also follow the same trend.

ABSTRACT: Poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu) and two
PBSu-rich poly(butylene succinate-co-propylene succinate)s
were studied. Copolyesters were characterized as random
copolymers, based on 13C-NMR spectra. TGA-FTIR was
used to monitor the degradation products at a heating rate
of 5C/min under N2. FTIR spectra revealed that the
major products were anhydrides, which were formed fol-
lowing two cyclic intramolecular degradation mechanisms
by the breaking of the weak O-CH2 bonds around succi-
nate groups. Thermal stability at heating rates of 1, 3, 5,
and 10C/min under N2 was investigated using TGA. The
model-free methods of the Friedman and Ozawa equations
are useful for studying the activation energy of degrada-
tion in each period of mass loss. The results reveal that
the random incorporation of minor propylene succinate
units into PBSu did not markedly affect their thermal re-
sistance. Two model-fitting mechanisms were used to
determine the mass loss function f(a), the activation energy
and the associated mechanism. The mechanism of autoca-
talysis nth-order, with f(a) ¼ am(1  a)n, fitted the experi-
mental data much more closely than did the nth-order
mechanism given by f(a) ¼ (1  a)n. The obtained activa-
tion energy was used to estimate the failure temperature
(Tf). The values of Tf for a mass loss of 5% and an endur-
ance time of 60,000 h are 160.7, 155.5, and 159.3C for
PBSu and two the copolyesters, respectively. VC 2011 Wiley

INTRODUCTION
Plastic products are part of daily life because of their
wide range of applications and extreme usefulness.
Imagining modern civilization without these prod-
ucts is difficult. However, they have led to the prob-
lem of the need to deal with a rapidly growing
amount of solid waste. Scientists and engineers are
considering solving problems of waste management
by replacing bio-resistant synthetic polymers with
biodegradable polymers. Aliphatic polyesters are
among the most interesting candidate biodegradable
materials because they are readily susceptible to
attack by enzymes or microorganisms. Bio-synthetic
aliphatic polyesters are generally regarded as one of
the most important classes of biodegradable poly-
mers. Some of them, such as bacterial poly(3-
hydroxy butyrate) (P3HB), are of particular interest.
Chemosynthetic aliphatic polyesters, including
poly(ethylene succinate) (PESu), poly(butylene succi-
nate) (PBSu), and poly(butylene adipate) (PBA), as
well as their copolymers, have been commercialized
because of their environmental compatibility.
PBSu is no doubt a highly promising biodegrad-
able polyester. It has a high melting temperature (Tm
 113C) and excellent mechanical properties which
are similar to the most extensively used polymers,
such as low-density polyethylene (LDPE).1 Many
studies of PBSu have been published to elucidate its
crystalline structure.2–4 The crystallization, spherulite
morphology, and melting behavior of PBSu have
also been extensively investigated.5–13 Copolymers
have higher degradation rates than homopolymers,
basically because they have lower crystallinity.
Therefore, some tests on PBSu and its various copo-
lyesters have been conducted to examine their
morphologies, crystallization kinetics, and melting
behaviors.9,14–17 Poly(propylene succinate) (PPSu),
with an odd number of methylene groups in the
diol monomer, has low crystallinity. It has attracted
increasing attention, because it has a higher biode-
gradation rate than that with an even number of
methylene groups in the diol monomer. To reduce
the crystallinity of PBSu, PBSu-rich aliphatic copo-
lyesters that combine the properties of the homopo-
lyesters—the high melting point of PBSu and the

Copolyester was synthesized and characterized as having 76.7 mol% butylene 
succinate (BS) units and 23.3 mol% propylene succinate (PS) units in a random 
sequence, as revealed by 
13
C NMR. After purification of this copolyester, its film 
was prepared in a hot press. Enzymatic degradation of this film was carried out 
at 37 °C in a 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The films (ca. 10 mg; 10 mm × 
10 mm × 0.1 mm) were placed in small test tubes containing 1.0 ml of the buffer. 
Biodegradation was performed by the addition of an aqueous solution of lipase (1 
mg/ml) and was incubated with shaking (100 rpm/min). In the Enzymatic 
degradation processing, buffer solution and enzyme were changed per day and 
the sample was washed with deionized water simultaneously. The film was 
periodically removed, washed with ethanol, water, and dried completely. The 
films after incubating for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 days were examined using 
GPC, 
1
H NMR, DSC and SEM. The percentage of weight loss was calculated. It 
was found that the molecular weight of this copolyester reduced continuously, but 
its weight decreased in two steps. The results of 
1
H NMR indicated that there 
was a corresponding composition change of BS units from 79 to 93 mol%. It was 
also found that there was a significant change in the degree of crystallinity and 
14 °C increase in the upper melting temperature of the films from the 10th to the 
15th days of incubation. It indicated that most of PS units in the copolyester were 
biodegraded before the 15th day. Therefore, the random incorporation of 21 
mol% PS units (
1
H NMR results) into poly(butylene succinate) markedly 
increases the biodegradation rate of the resultant polymer. Additionally, the 
lamellar of spherulites can be clearly observed in the SEM micrographs.
