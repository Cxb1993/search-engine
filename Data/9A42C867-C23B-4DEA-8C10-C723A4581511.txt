Recently, many methods have been 
proposed for constructing gene regulatory 
networks (GRNs). However, most of the 
existing methods ignored the time delay 
regulatory relation in the GRN predictions. 
In this paper, we propose a hybrid method, 
termed GA/PSO with DTW, to construct 
GRNs from microarray datasets. The 
proposed method uses test of correlation 
coefficient and the dynamic time warping 
(DTW) algorithm to determine the existence 
of a time delay relation between two genes. 
In addition, it uses the particle swarm 
optimization (PSO) to find thresholds for 
discretizing the microarray dataset. Based on 
the discretized microarray dataset and the 
predicted types of regulatory relations 
among genes, the proposed method uses a 
genetic algorithm to generate a set of 
candidate GRNs from which the predicted 
GRN is constructed. Three real-life 
sub-networks of yeast are used to verify the 
performance of the proposed method. The 
experimental results show that the GA/PSO 
with DTW is better than the other existing 
methods in terms of predicting sensitivity 
and specificity. 
 
3. 前言 
多年來，人類總是好奇究竟是哪些基因的
反應或調控(gene regulatory)影響了生物的
表現。微陣列技術的發明，讓生物學家減
少了研究所需花費的時間，也增加研究人
員了解生物基因反應的情形。以微陣列時
間序列資料為例，生物學家常用它來分析
基因之間彼此的互相反應(interaction)關
則以關聯規則表示為 A→B；若 A 基因同
時可以調控 B 基因與 C 基因，則可利用關
聯規則表示為 A→｛B, C｝。Mcinotosh and 
Chawla[9]提出了一個 high-confidence rule 
mining 的方法，此方法可有效地減少傳統
列列舉(row enumeration)演算法用在微陣
列資料中的計算複雜度，因此可以方便計
算出基因之間的關聯規則。上述的方法大
多用於預測少數基因之間的調控網路，因
此 Huang et al.[10]提出 modified Bayesian 
network 與 modified association rule，針對
大規模基因之間的調控網路進行預測；此
研究發現，不管是修正過或未修正的貝氏
網路，其表現皆比關聯規則還要好。 
  除了使用貝氏網路與關聯規則外，也有
人使用其他資料探勘(data mining)方法來
建立基因調控網路。例如，Linden and 
Bhaya[11]利用模糊規則(fuzzy rules)對基
因進行模糊化，再以基因規劃 (genetic 
programming) 搜尋基因的調控關係。 
   本計劃提出一個新的混合型的方法
(hybrid method) ， 利 用 動 態 時 間 校 正
(dynamic time warping, DTW)[13] 演 算
法，判斷基因之時間的有無延遲反應的關
係，再配合基因演算法、粒子群最佳化演
算法(particle swarm optimization, PSO)[14]
及統計條件機率，建立基因調控網路，我
們稱此方法為結合動態時間校正的基因/
粒 子 群 最 佳 化 演 算 法  (genetic 
algorithm/particle swarm optimization with 
dynamic time warping, 簡稱 GA/PSO with 
DTW)。

4.2 建立基本基因調控組合 
    由於最小的基因調控網路就是兩個
基因之間的調控關係；因此，我們藉由兩
個基因之間的調控關係往外擴張，建立整
個基因調控網路。藉由基因調控組合列
表，我們可以列出所有兩個基因之間的基
因調控組合。表(1)為 5 個基因的 10 種基

buy and hold policy. However, their system focused on 
single stock trading.  
    Chen et. al. [4] formulated the traditional portfolio 
problem as an investment strategy portfolio problem. 
They also proposed a combination genetic algorithm 
(CGA) to solve the investment strategy portfolio 
problem. Their experiments showed that the solution of 
CGA is better than uniform allocation.  
    
2.2 Fuzzy Time Series 
    
   Based on fuzzy sets [5], fuzzy time series model was 
proposed by Song and Chissom in 1993 [6]. According 
to Zadeh’s definition, a fuzzy set can be defined in the 
following. Let U, denoted by U={u1,u2,…,un}, be the set 
of universe of discourse. A fuzzy set A on U can be 
defined as follows: 
 
  
      
  
 
      
  
   
      
  
         (1) 
where 
          , 
and 
                    
 
   In Equation (1), fA is the membership function of 
fuzzy set A, and fA(ui) denotes the membership value of 
element ui  in  fuzzy set A.  
 
According to [6], the following definitions of fuzzy 
time series are given. 
Definition 1.  Let Y(t) (t =…,0,1,2,…), a subset of R1, 
be the universe of discourse in which fuzzy sets fi(t) (i = 
1,2...) are defined. If F(t) is a collection of fi(t), F(t) is 
called a fuzzy time series defined on Y(t). 
Definition 2. If for any fj(t)F(t), there exists an 
fi(t-1)F(t-1), such that there exists a fuzzy relation Rij(t, 
t-1) and fj(t)=fi(t-1)。Rij(t, t-l) where ‘。’ is the max-min 
composition, F(t) is said to be caused by F(t-1) only, and 
it can be represented by F(t-1)→F(t). 
Definition 3.  If F(t) is caused by F(t-1), F(t-2),…,and 
F(t-n), F(t) is called a 1-factor n-order fuzzy time series, 
and it can be represented by: 
Ft-n , …, Ft-2 , Ft-1 →Ft .    (2) 
 
2.3 Weighted Fuzzy Time Series 
 
   The weighted fuzzy time series model was proposed 
by Yu in 2005 [2]. Yu argued that recent fuzzy rules 
should play more important roles in prediction than the 
older fuzzy rules. Therefore, this model gives more 
weights to the recent fuzzy rules than the weights to the 
older rules.  
    
2.4 Genetic algorithms 
    
   Genetic algorithms (GAs), proposed by John Holland 
in 1970, provide a learning method motivated by 
analogy to biological evolution [3]. To find the optimal 
solution for a specific problem, a GA encodes the 
solutions to the problem into chromosomes. Each 
chromosome represents a feasible solution to the 
problem. A fitness function is devised to evaluate the 
goodness of the solutions to the problem. Better 
solutions will have higher fitness values. Through 
crossover and mutation operations, the GA generate a 
successor generation from the existing generation. With 
the selection operation, each successor generation 
contains solutions which are better than those of its 
predecessor generations. After evolving enough 
generations, GAs usually finds a good solution to the 
problem. Note that the solution found by GAs may not 
be the optimal solution. The flowchart of a prototypical 
genetic algorithm is shown in Fig. 1.

algorithm 
 
3. The proposed Method 
 
   In this section, we give the details of the proposed 
method for trading stock portfolios.  
 
3.1 Stock selection and investment allocation 
    
We integrate the stock selection and investment 
allocation into the integer encoding method of the GA. 
In the encoding method, we select at most five stocks in 
Taiwan 50 to construct a portfolio. For each selected 
stock, a weight for it in the investment is also selected.  
In the following, we use examples to illustrate the 
encoding method, the crossover and the mutation 
operations.

historical database. Then, put them together into a set 
called fuzzy logical relationship group (FLRG).  A 
matched FLR is an FLR whose left hand side matches 
the left hand side of the FLR of the prediction day. 
Step 5：Predict the stock price 
   The predicted value is the weighted sum of the right 
hand side of the rules in FLRG. The following example 
illustrates this step. Assume that the FLR database is as 
follows: 
  (t=1) A1 →A1 , 
  (t=2) A1 →A2 , 
  (t=3) A2 →A1 , 
  (t=4) A1 →A1 , 
  (t=5) A1 →A1 . 
Assume that the left hand side of the predicting day (t=6) 
is A1. Then the defuzzified values of the matched FLRs 
and their weights are shown as follows: 
  (t=1) A1  →A1   weight 1, 
  (t=2) A1  →A2   weight 2, 
  (t=4) A1  →A1   weight 3, 
  (t=5) A1  →A1   weight 4. 
Finally the value of day 6 is calculated according to 
Equation (2) as follows:   
 
Predicted value=     
 
       
   A2   
 
       
  
     
 
       
   A1   
 
       
    (2) 
 
Note that A1  is the mid-point value of its corresponding 
interval u1. 
 
3.3 Fitness function  
 
   The GA uses fitness function to select better 
chromosomes to survive in the evolution process. In this 
stock portfolio trading problem, the fitness function is 
the expected return rate of a portfolio. The expected 
return rate of a portfolio is the weighted sum of the 
returned rates of its constituent stocks, which is shown in 
Equation (3).  
 
Fitness value =    
 
                        ,  (3) 
 
where Fi (t+5) is the predicted price of stock i at date  
t+5;  Ni(t) is the price of stock i at date t; Ci is the 
proportion of the investment on stock i. Note that we 
assume that there are 5 stocks in each portfolio and the 
new portfolio is constructed at date t.   
 
3.4 Stock portfolio trading Strategy  
 
   The trading strategy comprises two policies: 
periodically checking and stop-lose point checking. 
  
3.4.1 Periodically checking 
 
Suppose that we buy a portfolio S at date t. Then five 
days later at date t+5, we generate a new portfolio S’ 
with the best expected return rate, and compute the 
expected return rate of portfolio S. If the expected return 
rate of the new portfolio S’ is greater than that of S, we 
sell S and buy S’; otherwise, we hold S. The scenario is 
shown in Fig. 2.  
 
 
 
Figure 2. Trading strategy at transaction time points 
 
3.4.2 Stop-lose point checking  
 
  When the market plunges abruptly, the loss of a stock 
portfolio may be huge if it is not sold promptly. To cope 
with the volatility of the market, we set a stop-lose point 
which is the amount of return loss beyond which we sell 
the stock portfolio. Two stop-lose points are set for the 
proposed strategy. They are daily stop-lose point and 
accumulated stop-lose point. The former is for the loss in 
a day, after opening and before closing of the market, 
while the later is for the accumulated loss within five 
consecutive trading days. When a stop-lose point is 
reached, we sell the stock portfolio and buy another 
stock portfolio at the next trading day. The stop-lose 
point is set at -7% in the following experiment. The 
scenario of stop-lose point is shown in Fig. 3.  
  
 
 
Figure 3. Trading strategy with stop-lose point 
 
4. Experiments and Analysis 
 
  To show the viability of the proposed strategy, we 
implement a trading system in JAVA. The system is 
composed of a GA and a weighted fuzzy time series 
model. With the predicted return rates of portfolios by 
the weighted fuzzy time series, the GA select best stock 
portfolios for investments. In the following, we report 
the experimental data, benchmarking indices and the 
experimental results.  
 
4.1Experimental data 
 
Table 6 and Fig. 4 also contrast the return rates for the 
strategies with or without transaction cost. It shows that 
the proposed strategy still attains much higher 7-year 
average return rate than the two benchmarking indices 
when the transaction cost is considered.  
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.4.2 Compared with the buy and hold policy 
 
   One common practice in stock trading is the buy and 
hold policy. With the buy and hold policy, the investor 
buys a stock and wait for some period of time before 
selling it. In this experiment we turn off the periodical 
check mechanism after buying a stock portfolio. Then 
we hold it for a month and then using the GA to find 
another portfolio to replace it. The return rates 
comparison is shown in both Table 7 and Fig. 5. The 
results show that to buy a stock portfolio with the buy 
and hold policy cannot rakes in profit due to not 
reacting to the market properly. 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Return rates including the buy and hold policy 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
   In this paper we propose to use the genetic algorithm 
and the fuzzy time series model to construct efficient 
stock portfolios. By integrating policies of periodical 
checking and stop lose-point checking with the GA, an 
effective stock portfolio system has been developed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Through experiments on stocks in Taiwan 50, we 
show that the return rates of the proposed system are 
significantly better than those of the markets, i.e., 
TAIEX and Taiwan 50 index, and the buy and hold 
policy. There are assumptions that limit the application 
of the system. Especially, the assumption on capability 
of buying odd shares needs to be lifted since odd share 
trading has many restrictions. Some improvements 
should be made to take into account the transaction lot 
constraint (i.e., minimum number of shares of a stock in 
a transaction) in constructing a stock portfolio.
