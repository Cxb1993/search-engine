shapes to meet antenna Radom and mechanical requirements of mobile handheld products. 
The proposed wire monopole antenna has become better acceptable solution for wireless 
applications. Issues such as internal environments, complexity of design, narrow bandwidth and 
dimensional requirements can be easily solved and co-integration together. The proposed antenna, 
therefore, has advantages to meet wider bandwidth requirements, easy fabrication, matching tuning, 
and radiation pattern control by wire radiator. We present an innovative wire monopole antenna 
(Fig. 1) suitable for application as an internal antenna in a 2.5G and 3G mobile handset. The 
proposed dual path monopole antenna co-design is designed on a practical PCB size (90mm x 
50mm), as shown in Fig. 2, which serves as a support for the monopole, and has a radiator 
compact size of 30mm x 6mm x 6mm. The proposed wire monopole is formed by two folded wire 
line. This long folded wire line radiator has a total length of about (2H+2L1+W1) 78mm, which 
excited low band antenna bandwidth of the wire monopole antenna. The short folded wire line 
radiator has a total length of about (H+L1-L2) 21mm, which excited high band antenna bandwidth 
of the wire monopole antenna. With the finite dimensions of the folded wire monopole antenna in 
this design, the total length of the effective radiator wire path of the antenna is close to one quarter 
wavelength at free space of the center frequency of low band and high band, the low band resonant 
frequency of the long wire radiator occurs at about 893MHz center frequency and high band 
resonant frequency of the short wire radiator occurs at about 1885MHz center frequency. 
In addition, by fine-tuning the length of the wire length of the long and short folded wire 
radiators, the antenna resonant frequency of the bandwidth can be effectively controlled, but 
antenna multi-coupling effect for long wire and short wire multi-interference so the antenna 
resonant frequency has affected with each other. These two wider resonant frequencies of wire 
monopole antenna, has a wider antenna impedance bandwidth, thereby making it possible that the 
resonant frequencies of the antenna be tuned to occur, respectively, at bandwidth about 
820MHz-960MHz and 1650MHz-2200MHz, as shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, the prototype of the 
proposed wire monopole antenna has been successfully implemented, manufacture, and in addition 
to the dual wider frequency resonator behavior obtained, wider antenna matching conduction, good 
quality radiation integrity characteristics across the operating bands have also been experimental. 
The operating bandwidths of the proposed antennas can cover the 2.5G/3G mobile handset 
operation, and the antenna gain is stable. Besides, it can also generate the good radiation patterns 
in the 3D measurement environment and good antenna performance has been obtained. Based on 
the 3D measurement system (Fig. 4) and far-field antenna scanning technology, the measured data 
of antenna radiation efficiency and peak gain are shown in Table 1.

Antenna Design & Results for DVB-H Operations 
 
In this DVB-H antenna design, a new cap structure of monopole antenna with a parallel feeding 
structure and band switching are investigated. This antenna provides a wide input impedance 
bandwidth, and a small size for handset co-integration. The measured results show that the return 
loss and wider antenna matching impedance of the cap type monopole antenna provides a 
considerably large bandwidth even with a radiating area. It is found that the cap loaded monopole 
antenna with a cap mounted metal is comparable to the different feeding position at the same 
monopole antenna radiator and with and respect to geometry size and electrical performance. The 
measured results of a low-Q monopole antenna with a cap metal mounted on the top and fed with 
parallel probe, simultaneously. In this design also review some mobile TV and GPS specification, 
future progress and application. 
A 3D metal-cap monopole antenna fed by using an effective one to four parallel feeding probes 
(Fig. 5) is presented. With the use of the proposed feeding structure, the 3D metal-cap monopole 
antenna (Fig. 6) studied shows a very wide impedance bandwidth of about 1230 MHz (about 
370-1600 MHz, bandwidth return loss about -5dB) for bands selection, which is larger than two 
times the bandwidth obtained using some simple one to one type, one to two type, one to three 
type and one to four type of parallel feeding probes. This antenna principle and design method can 
improve and control return loss bandwidth and antenna input impedance for suitable and fit design 
band. In addition, the proposed 3D metal-cap monopole antenna and multi-feeding probes can be 
co-integrated, that is, the feeding probes and the low-Q monopole together can be easily fabricated 
using a mechanism model, making the proposed antenna easy to construct at a low cost. Details of 
the experimental and simulation results for the proposed 3D metal-cap and low-Q monopole 
antenna are presented, analyzed and measured. An effective parallel feed three dimensional (3D) 
cap monopole antenna (Fig. 7) capable of wider frequency operation at about 400MHz-1600 MHz 
(referenced -5dB return loss) is presented. The 3D cap monopole antenna occupies a small area of 
60λ  at design frequency, and is easily made using thin copper. The 3D cap monopole antenna 
can be parallel fed and control the different feeding position and switching (Fig. 8) to the main 
circuit board of a wireless device so that it offers a compact design with a free degree of feed point 
so as to save RF device and antenna space, resulting in a low profile to the practical PDA ground 
plane. In addition, the obtained impedance bandwidths of the proposed antenna at about UHF/L

Antenna Design & Results for Wi-Fi Operations 
In this Wi-Fi antenna design, satisfy specific bandwidth specifications for modern wireless LAN 
co
 
 
mmunication systems such as IEEE 802.11a (5.15-5.35GHz and 5.47-5.825GHz), IEEE 802.11b 
(2.4-2.485GHz), IEEE 802.11g (2.4-2.485GHz) and IEEE 802.11n (2.4-2.485GHz, 5.15-5.35GHz 
and 5.47-5.825GHz) have been implemented and developed. In this implement, the study mainly 
focuses on the current trends in development of compact and low profile Wi-Fi PDA and smart 
mobile phone and provides a wideband monopole antenna design suitable for application in 
wireless LAN communicating system in the near future. By utilizing the monopole antenna 
structure, the proposed antenna design is easy to be embedded into the mobile phone co-integration 
operation. In this design, we applied a 50Ω semi-rigid cable fed dual wideband monopole radiator, 
which have the bandwidth covers IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n bands. This monopole antenna has good 
radiation characteristic and usable antenna gain. The design folded monopole antenna for wireless 
LAN mobile system application which can be applied. This antenna enhances the bandwidth of 
wire monopole antenna to cover the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n. The folded wire monopole antenna has 
wider coverage radiation beam pattern and suitable antenna gain. In this design, the innovative 
monopole antenna for single fed to excite dual radiator wire path is presented. 
These proposed antennas can find applications in wireless LAN IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n and 
Vo
opole antenna provide expertise especially in the area of compact 
as
rom degradation in performance of narrow bandwidth 
an
IP/WiFi wireless systems application. The design of a dual wideband wire monopole antenna 
with dual path of folded wire radiator with applications for wireless VoIP and VoWLAN uses is 
investigated. With the broadside radiations, the proposed wire monopole antenna carries a stable 
gain variation in the 2.4-2.5 GHz and 5-6 GHz bands, respectively. In this paper, wire line 
monopole antenna design in practical PDA mobile handheld size for experiment is designed. 
Frequency characteristics and antenna input impedance optimized with various design parameters 
are analyzed and measured. Designed internal monopole wire antenna on the handset is simulated 
and measured. And the internal monopole antenna attached on the handset is tested for far-field 
antenna anechoic chamber. And a result of the external monopole antenna bandwidth is referenced 
-10dB return loss and bandwidth cover 2200-2500MHz and 5000-5800MHz, respectively. So the 
internal wire monopole antenna has a wider antenna bandwidth in comparison with traditional 
patch antenna or PIFA antenna. 
The applications of wire mon
sembly on mobile PDA phone factor. Wire monopole antenna for internal configuration can be 
designed in various structures shapes to meet antenna radome and mechanical requirements of 
mobile products. The proposed wire monopole antenna has become better acceptable solution for 
wireless applications. Issues such as internal environments, complexity of design, narrow 
bandwidth and dimensional requirements can be easily solved and co-integration together. The 
proposed antenna, therefore, has advantages to meet wider bandwidth requirements, easy 
fabrication, matching tuning, multi-antennas terminal (MIMO) application, and radiation pattern 
control by wire radiator shape and path. Then, we present multi-band monopole antenna designs 
for mobile WLAN devices such as PDA phones and laptop computers operations. Although the 
designed antenna device is of innovation configuration, the folded monopole is applicable in 
wideband characteristic and the experiment rules are quite good performance. Thus, for this study, 
the design consideration of the monopole WLAN antenna will focus on return loss, input 
impedance of antenna bandwidth analysis.  
An internal small antenna usually suffers f
d radiation efficiency. In this experiment, we design and fabricate a dual broadband interior type 
wire monopole with a high performance radiation pattern over a design operation band using 
The measured antenna input impedance results of the optimized monopole antenna. The 
measured impedance bandwidth is cover 2400-2500 MHz and 5000-6000 MHz. The dual 
wideband impedance bandwidth is easily to apply practical PDA handset for VoIP/WiFi 
application and wireless system integration and easily to fine tuning the antenna and RF circuit 
matching interface. The dual path folded wire radiator in this monopole antenna structure, the 
operating impedance bandwidth for the further 4G VoWLAN wireless communication bands can 
be obtained. In this design and experiment, operating antenna resonant frequency and bandwidth 
can be easily obtained by adjusting the folded wire length for low band and high band bandwidth. 
An innovation design is an interior monopole with a folded wire radiator. It has a measured 
VSWR bandwidth (referenced rate=2) about 300MHz with center frequency at 2.35GHz 
(2.2-2.5GHz) and 800MHz with center frequency at 5.325GHz (5.0-5.8GHz), as shown in Fig. 5. 
The innovative monopole wire antenna, including diversity antennas, MIMO multi-antennas 
terminal, array antennas as access point and wideband antenna for WLAN, WiFi, VoIP and 
VoWLAN operation, is experimentally studied and presented in this paper. Novel and low-cost 
antennas suitable for wireless LAN antenna is presented. The operating bandwidths of the 
proposed antennas can cover the 2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz WLAN bands, and the antenna gain is about 
larger than 1dBi in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz full bands; respectively. Besides, they can also generate 
the good radiation patterns in the azimuth plane and good antenna performance has been obtained.

good agreement between 3D measurement and analysis has been obtained. The proposed antenna 
shows a wider operating bandwidth and it easy to cover the GSM, EDGE, CDMA, CDMA 2000, 
W-CDMA and UMTS band for wireless communication and 2.5G/3G dual mode operation of a 
mobile handset phone, co-design, co-integration and applications. 
A wideband 3D metal-cap monopole antenna for DVB-H and Media-FLO wireless mobile TV 
systems is presented. The proposed feeding structure consists of multi-probes with parallel feeding 
and radiator consists of a wideband and low-Q characteristics. In order to generate wideband 
characteristics, we propose that one to four parallel feeding structures are required. For some 
applications, it is required that a digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H) antenna be integrated 
into a PDA or smart phone to provide DVB-H signal reception. For this purpose, several wideband 
designs include the co-integration of DVB-T, DVB-H (Band IV, Band V and Band L), GPS, DMB 
and Media-FLO bands. These compact designs and experimental results are described in this study. 
This technique is suitable for creating wideband antenna with bandwidth improved and bandwidth 
and antenna impedance control. 
In Wi-Fi antenna design, a compact and low profile internal wire monopole antenna for 
multi-bands has been proposed. This antenna was designed and measured. A good agreement 
between measurement and analysis has been obtained. The proposed antenna shows a wider 
operating bandwidth and it easy to cover the IEEE 802.11a (5.15-5.35GHz and 5.47-5.825GHz), 
IEEE 802.11b (2.4-2.485GHz), IEEE 802.11g (2.4-2.485GHz) and IEEE 802.11n (2.4-2.485GHz, 
5.15-5.35GHz and 5.47-5.825GHz) bands for wireless communication and 4G wireless multimedia

In essence, flex circuits give you unlimited 
freedom of packaging and antenna geometry 
while retaining the precision density, and 
repeatability of printed circuits. FPC has these 
advantages over traditional PCB, such as below 
listing 
¾ Because they fit only one way, flexible 
circuits and FPC antenna structures eliminate 
wire routing errors, so you save testing time, 
rework, and rejects. 
¾ Flexible circuit and FPC antenna 
conductor patterns maintain uniform electrical 
characteristics, so you can predict and control 
noise, crosstalk, and impedance. 
¾ Flex circuits and FPC antenna structure 
can save 70% on space and weight. A single 
flexible circuit can replace several hardboards, 
cables, and connectors. 
¾ Flexible circuits and FPC antenna 
structure reduce the chance of assembly rejects 
and in-service failures, so total installed costs are 
lower, especially with volume production. 
¾ The flat foil conductors of flexible circuits 
and FPC antenna structure dissipate heat better 
and carry more current than round wires of the 
same cross-sectional area. 
¾ Flexible circuits and FPC antenna simplify 
assembly and give a better appearance. And 
there is no need to color code and wrap bundles 
of wire. 
The traditional mobile system with fixed 
antenna design that the radiation pattern easy 
influence by communication environment and 
handicap, therefore not to bring maximum 
radiation direction quality. In the recent radiation 
pattern control research, the diversity antenna 
technology [1] not only to settle signal 
propagation fading issue but also diversity 
receivers provide increased sensitivity immunity 
to dropouts due to multi-patch in wireless mobile 
communication. Another smart antenna [2] 
technology applied in wireless communications 
to supply optimum signal transceiver and the 
best signal to noise ratio by smart software 
control and wave propagation estimation. In this 
paper, authors propose a simple pattern control 
design by FPC antenna technology. The FPC 
serve flexible or soft antenna which designer 
based control that provides antenna parameters 
i.e. pattern direction, radiation efficiency, 
antenna impedance and specific absorption rate 
(SAR) issues control of any position and 
ancillary equipment, such as internal or external 
wireless system products application and quick 
to meet a life cycle of wireless products design 
and antenna performance fine tuning. The FPC 
antennas (Fig. 1) applied soft printer substrate 
not only for product configuration, effective 
radiation operation, variation impedance 
matching control by FPC antenna curve shape 
and antenna performance maintenance are very 
useful and quick to verify, but also to get rid of 
traditional RLC lumped matching condition. For 
radiation direction not only control by desired 
position or antenna shape but also can change 
radiation direction to reduce SAR value on 
human body with interaction. In FPC antenna 
flexible shape control are available in a variety 
of method and solution which suitable serve 
complex and crowded wireless system as an 
antenna application. 
II. DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE 
FPC material function, type and options, as 
shown in TABLE I, and electrical parameters, 
which quarter wavelength monopole FPC 
antenna [3] with 50 ohm CPW uniplanar feed 
network and design frequency at 2450MHz 
suitable for ISM band application. Based on 
CPW excited, which possess some advantages of 
low radiation loss, propagation dispersion, no 
via holes required easy fabrication and 
integration. Design environment with a FPC 
(Polyimide film, PI material which dielectric 
constant rε  is approach 2.8~3.2), metalized 
plastics with copper 35 mμ thickness and 
mechanical monopole antenna range size for 
40*15mm maximum rectangular form. 
Monopole antenna with flexible and ultra-light 
structures is essential and necessary for the 
future wireless telecommunication systems. The 
flexible structures have a very simple 
performance on the distortion of the structures 
for the beaming control. The PI film produced 
by flexible mobile antenna not only can fully 
meets any general wireless system requirements 
of different product applications, but also 
possess the advanced plasticity and malleability 
characteristics of high tensile strength, high 
temperature tolerance, and anti-corrosion are 
very suitable for mobile antenna implement. Key 
points that FPC antenna easily to meet the 
product mechanical design requirement of 
modern wireless electronics on desired 
environment. In Fig. 2 FPC antenna design 
based on meander structure which operated 
GSM (EDGE) and WCDMA (UMTS) dual 
wideband antenna resonance and frequency 
responses. And In Fig. 3 FPC antenna design 
based on branch lines structure which operated 
GSM and CDMA+GPS dual wideband antenna 
resonance and frequency responses. FPC 
antennas can easily integrated mechanism of 
consumer mobile phone structure.
III. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS 
In this VSWR for FPC antennas are less 
than 2.5:1 and antenna bandwidth is cover 
GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/BT/WLAN main 
frequency bands then FPC antennas are design 
and measured. Electromagnetic (EM) simulation
