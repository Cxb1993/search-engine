This object of this project is to reduce network traffic in a NCS with retaining control 
performances. Two approaches, network scheduling and deadband sampling, are employed to 
achieve the design goal. For network scheduling base NCSs we have found stability preserving 
scheduling policies for discrete-time NCSs; we have derived robust stability preserving scheduling 
policies for continuous-time polytopic NCSs; and we have developed L2-gain rendering scheduling 
policies for continuous-time NCSs. For deadband sampling NCSs we have found stability 
preserving deadband sampling rules for NCSs with; we have derived robust stability preserving 
deadband sampling policies for polytopic NCSs; and we have developed deadband sampling 
policies for NCSs with preserving L2-gain performance.

point-to-point wired feedback control system. On the other hand, the other systems are just like 
uncontrolled (open-loop).  
In order to preserve the stability, a plant should be attended with an adequate frequency and 
length in time. If the communication resources are not properly allocated, the systems may exhibit 
undesirable behaviors. Let the time be divided into periodic cycles with period T = Kh (h is the 
sampling period of the systems and K is a positive integer), see Fig. 3. Without loss of generality, 
we assume the network is operating in static scheduling protocol and in each period the first KONih 
time slot is allocated for the i-th system. Then, the i-th system would be uncontrolled (open-loop) in 
the remain time slot KOFFih= (K- KONi)h. Define  
        
K
KN ONiui =         (3) 
which is called the attention rate of the i-th plant. To reduce the network usage, the attention rate 
uiN  should be as small as possible. This means that we can preserve the stability of the closed-loop 
system with less network usage.

For the considered systems, the dynamics of the i-th subsystem can be modeled as a switched

where nRx ∈  is the state, mRu ∈  is the control input, iA  and iB  are know constant matrices, 
and iα , i=1,2,…,m, are uncertain parameters which satisfy 10 ≤≤ iα  and ∑ =p
i
i 1α . Suppose 
that the open-loop system is unstable. The feedback loop of (7) is closed via a shared network link. 
Suppose that only the sensor-to-controller path is networked. The used shared network link may 
need to transmit some other messages beside the data exchanging among the components of the 
NCS. Therefore, in each period, only a little time slot the network can be allocated for the NCS. In 
this subsection, we discuss how to allocate the communication resources to preserve the robust 
stability of the control system. We want to find a low bound for the attention rate for guaranteeing 
the stability of the NCS for all possible uncertainties. Assume that the data transmission in the 
network link is ideal (i.e., no data processing time, no transmission time, no data loss (packet loss), 
and no quantization error et al.). That is, if the network is allocated to the control system (7), then 
the behavior of the system is just like a point-to-point wired control system. However, if the 
network is not allocated to the system, it is just like an uncontrolled (open-loop) system.  
We consider the state feedback controller:

Suppose that the feedback law (8) stabilizes the system (7) in the traditional point-to-point wired

II.A.3、L2-gain rendering scheduling policy for networked feedback ∞H  control systems 
In this subsection, the ∞H  disturbance attenuation performance will be considered for 
scheduling-based NCSs. We consider the case that a set of continuous-time plants whose feedback 
loops are closed by a shared network link, as shown in Figure 2. The i-th system is described as: 
           )()()()( 21 tuBtwBtxAtx iiiiiii ++=& , i=1,2,…,N      (14) 
       )()()( 121 tuDtxCtz iiiii +=  
where ni Rx ∈  is the state, si Rw ∈  is the disturbance input, mi Ru ∈  is the control input, and 
r
i Rz ∈  is the controlled output of the i-th system, and iA , iB1 , iB2 , iC1 , and iD12  are constant 
matrices. Suppose that all the open-loop systems are unstable. In addition, we consider the case that 
only the sensor-to-controller path is networked. Due to the limited communication capacity, the 
network link can only close one feedback loop of a control system at a time, while the other control 
loops are assumed to be open-loop. In this subsection, we discuss how to allocate the 
communication resources so that the internal stability and 2L -gain performance of all the systems 
are guaranteed. 
Suppose that, by point-to-point wiring, the feedback laws 
)()( txFtu iii = , i=1,2,…,N         (15) 
are such that all the closed-loop systems are internally stable and satisfy the 2L  gain requirement: 
∫∫ ≤ T iTiiT iTi dttwtwdttztz  0 20 0 )()()()( γ , for each 0>T  and for some ii γγ <0 , i=1,2,…,N. (16) 
In the scheduling-based networked feedback architecture, according to the static state feedback 
law (15), each system communicates with its remote controller that occasionally transmits state 
signals over the shared network. We want to find low bounds of attention rates for the systems in 
(14) to guarantee finite L2 – induced gain. Assume that the data transmission in the communication

II.B Deadband Sampling Networked Control Systems 
II.B.1、Stability preserving deadband sampling rules for NCSs 
II.B.1.1、Discrete-time case 
In this subsection we will introduce a new concept for designing networked feedback controllers, 
with low network usage, for discrete-time systems. Consider the following discrete-time system: 
          )()()1( kBukAxkx +=+ ,         (23) 
Suppose that the open-loop system is unstable. The sensor samples the state periodically. However, 
not all the measured data are sent to the controller via the communication network. The measured 
data will be sent only if necessary. The other data are discarded to reduce network traffic.  
Here we assume that only the data from the sensor to controller are transmitted by network link. 
The control signal from the controller can be directly fed to the actuators. Moreover, suppose the 
network communicates ideally (no time-delay, no packet dropout, no quantization errors, et al.). 
Suppose that the feedback gain F satisfies  
1)( <+ BFAiλ . 
That is, for the traditional point-to-point wiring framework, the static state feedback controller:  
)()( kFxku =         (24) 
can asymptotically stabilizes the system (23). 
 
A、Periodic transmission 
We first consider the periodic transmission situation. Not all the state information measured by 
the sensor (x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3), ….) will be sent to the controller by shared network. Only the data 
measured at jq, j=1,2,…, will be sent (i.e., the feedback signals are: x(0), x(q), x(2q),…….). Under 
the condition of 1)( <+ BFAiλ , what’s the maximal q that will not destroy the stability the 
closed-loop system is our first problem. In this situation, the control signal is 
)()( iqFxku = , qikiq )1( +<≤  
Therefore, the dynamics of the considered system can be described as: 
qikiqiqBFxkAxkx )1( if  ),()()1( +<≤+=+ ,       (25) 
As q increases, the number of messages sent by the sensor node decreases and therefore the network 
traffic decreases. However, if q increases, the performance of the control system deteriorates. We 
have the following results

2. q=10  : [ ]1063.01315.0 −=F  
3. q=100 : [ ]0573.00708.0 −=F  
The responses of the system with different q are shown in Fig. 10(a), Fig. 10(b), and Fig. 10(c). It 
can be verified that the system is asymptotically stable in all cases.

decreases. However, as the size of the deadband increases, the performance of the control system 
deteriorates. Implementing deadbands to reduce network traffic produces uncertainty in the state of 
the system. Since the controller relies on the state to compute the control signal, it is important to 
determine the state dependent deadband to guarantee the stability and performance of the system. 
Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, we will derive a rule to determine whether a measured data 
should be sent to the controller. Let ki be the time that the i-th transmission occurs at the sensor 
node. That is, the control signal is

II.B.1.2、Continuous-time case 
A、Non-periodic transmission 
For continuous-time system, consider 
)()()( tButAxtx +=&        (31) 
Suppose that F is such that BFA +  is Hurwitz. Let ti be the time that the i-th transmission occurs 
at the sensor node. That is, the employed controller is 
)()( itFxtu = , 1i if +<≤ ittt       (32) 
The closed-loop system can be described as: 
 26
we can verify that it only needs to send 44 data per second. The response of the networked feedback 
closed-loop system is shown in Fig. 11. It is obvious that the trajectory converges to the origin very 
quickly even if only 44 measured data in the first second have been sent to the controller. In this 
method, the network usage is significantly reduced (44/10000).

B、Periodic transmission  
Here we consider the case that the measured data is sent periodically. Consider the system: 
         )()()( tButAxtx +=& ,           (37) 
Similarly, suppose that the open-loop system is unstable and the transmission process is ideal.  
Suppose that F is such that BFA +  is Hurwitz. Since BFA +  is Hurwitz, for any positive 
definite matrix Q there exists a unique positive definite solution P to 
        0)()( <++++ QBFAPPBFA T .        (38) 
For periodic transmission, at the sensor node, only the data measured at τk , k=1,2,…, will be 
sent to the controller (i.e., the feedback signal are x(0), x(τ ), x(2τ ),…). That is, the control signal 
is 
)()( τiFxtu = , ττ )1( +<≤ iti  
In this case the dynamic behavior of the networked feedback system is described by: 
τττ )1( if  ),()()( +<≤+= ktkkBFxtAxtx& .     (39) 
Define the error signal 
   )()()( τkxtxte −= , for ττ )1( +<≤ ktk . 
It is clear that 0)( =τke , k=1,2,…. We know that if transmission period τ  increases, then the 
communication rate will decrease (the network usage decreases). However, large τ  might destroy 
 28
low transmission rate networked feedback robust controllers for the polytopic system: 
        ( )∑
=

p

iiii tuBtxAtx

)()()( α& ,         (43) 
Similarly, suppose that the open-loop system is unstable and the transmission process is ideal.  
Suppose that a matrix F exists such that there exist positive definite matrices P and Q satisfying 
      0)()( <++++ QFBAPPFBA iiTii , i=1,2,…,p.       (44) 
It is obvious that, under (44), by traditional point-to-point wiring, the static state feedback controller 
             )()( tFxtu =         (45) 
asymptotically stabilizes the polytopic system (43). 
 
A、Non-periodic transmission 
 In here we do not require the measured data being sent periodically. They are sent only if 
necessary. We find a rule to decide whether the measured data is critical. If the measured data is not 
critical for stability, it will be discarded for reducing network traffic. For demonstration, let tj be the 
time that the j-th transmission occurs at the sensor node. The networked feedback law is 
           )()( jtFxtu = , 1+<≤ jj ttt .       (45)

then the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable.

B、Periodic transmission 
In this subsection we consider the periodic transmission case. At the sensor node, only the data 
measured at τk , k=1,2,…, will be sent to the controller via the network link (i.e., the feedback 
signal are x(0), x(τ ), x(2τ ),….). In this case the dynamic behavior of the networked feedback 
system is described by the following dynamic equation:
