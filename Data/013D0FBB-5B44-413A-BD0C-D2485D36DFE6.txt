  The small bandgap (EG) Ge shows high 
potential for MOSFET application due to both 
higher electron and hole mobility than Si. 
However, the difficult challenges are the high 
leakage current of small EG Ge, poor 
high-κ/Ge interface property, and low doping 
activation at ion-implanted source-drain 
[1]-[16]. To address the leakage current issue, 
we pioneered the defect-free Ge-on-insulator 
(GOI or GeOI)[1] structure and ultra-thin 
body Ge-on-Si[11]. The high-κ/Ge interface 
property can also be improved by using an 
ultra-thin robust SiO2 interfacial layer. 
Nevertheless, the poor doping activation by 
RTA is still an issue, while the high 
temperature RTA degrades the mobility by Ge 
out-diffusion and forming poor interface. 
Although a gate-last process with GeO2 
dielectric was developed for this purpose 
[11]-[15], the gate-first process is still 
attractive for much simple process. Besides, 
the filling in narrower gate opening with both 
high-κ and metal using gate-last process is 
another concern, since Ge is expected to 
implement in 15~10 nm node CMOS. In this 
paper we have used low energy laser 
annealing [16] to improve the doping 
activation of ion-implanted source-drain and 
preserve good high-κ/Ge interface, while laser 
annealing is also essential for ultra-shallow 
junction. High performance gate-first 
TaN/La2O3/SiO2/Ge n-MOSFET was obtained 
using laser annealing, with high peak mobility 
of 603 cm2/Vs and 0.75 MV/cm mobility of 
304 cm2/Vs at small 1.9 nm EOT. The good 
mobility at high effective electric field (Eeff) is 
required for highly scaled MOSFET with 
small EOT. These results are beyond the best 
reported data for gate-first 
metal-gate/high-κ/Ge n-MOSFET at small 
一、 簡介 
mobility of 603 cm2/Vs and 0.75 MV/cm 
mobility of 304 cm2/Vs are reached for the Ge 
n-MOSFETs using laser anneal, which is the 
highest electron mobility for gate-first Ge 
n-MOSFET. 
四、 結論 
Using low energy laser anneal on 
TaN/La2O3/SiO2 Ge n-MOSFETs, small 
junction n-factor of 1.3, big 105 n+/p junction 
forward/reverse current, high 603 cm2/Vs 
peak mobility and good high-field (0.75 
MV/cm) mobility of 304 cm2/Vs were reached 
simultaneously at small EOT of 1.9 nm.

Abstract  -  A 0.18 μm CMOS low noise amplifier using RC-
feedback topology is proposed with optimized matching, gain, 
noise, linearity and area for UWB applications. The IC prototype 
achieved 9.5 dB of average power gain, low 3.4 dB noise figure 
(NF), -9.2 dB input match, -13.5 dB return loss, -6 dBm of IIP3 
and only 0.54 mm2 size with 15 mW power consumption. Good 
agreement between the simulated and measured results is found.  
I. INTRODUCTION
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has 
distributed 7500 MHz bandwidth for ultra-wideband (UWB) 
applications. Ultra-wideband technology using the unlicensed 
frequency band from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz has become much 
interest of broadband wireless communication due to its high 
data rates, low power transmission, robustness for multi-path 
fading and low power dissipation. Among possible 
applications, UWB technology may be used for imaging 
systems, vehicular and ground penetrating radars, and 
communication systems. For such broadband applications, the 
low noise amplifier (LNA) is the first stage in the UWB 
receiver. It must provide good input impedance matching, low 
power consumption, low noise performance and sufficient gain 
with good S/N for the following stages, and small size over the 
entire frequency band [1]-[13]. Recently, the CMOS 
technology is a candidate for UWB LNA system [7]-[19] when 
considering the time to market, hardware cost, the degree of 
difficulty, and high integration with baseband digital circuits – 
for a good System-on-Chip (SoC) solution. However, these 
performance requirements for UWB are very challenging using 
CMOS technology. This is because the CMOS technology can 
only provide small gain at high frequency, low cut-off 
frequency (fT) [20]-[22], significant substrate loss [23]-[24] 
and poor inductor Q-factors [22] compared with GaAs 
technology. Several different circuit approaches, including 
distributed amplifier (DA), LC ladder, current-reused, shunt 
feedback, etc., have been proposed to overcome these issues 
[7]-[19]. 
The RC-feedback cascode topology is one of the main 
methods for wideband amplifier design [11]-[16]. The RC-
feedback cascode configuration can provide good input 
matching and improve gain flatness. However, the challenge of 
this technique is very wide bandwidth along with low noise 
and high gain. In this work an ultra-wideband CMOS LNA is 
proposed a cascode amplifier with three stages: new RC-
feedback cascode topology, LC shunt configuration and output 
current buffer technology, implemented in 0.18 μm CMOS 
technology. With new RC-feedback cascade connection and  
LC shunt techniques, this LNA achieved a 9.5 dB average 
power gain, a 3.4 dB NF, input reflect loss less than -9.2 dB, 
output return loss less than -13.5 dB and the input IIP3 is -6 
dBm from ultra-wide band LNA circuit. These results are 
suitable for UWB LNA circuit application.
II. CIRCUIT DESIGN
The UWB LNA requires high gain, low noise figure and 
high linearity over the entire band with low power 
consumption. The LNA also needs to have a good input 
mating over the whole band to capture the transmitted RF 
energy efficiently. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the proposed 
three stages amplifier. The first stage is the capacitance-
resistance feedback cascode topology that provides high gain, 
wider bandwidth, better stability and well reverse isolation. 
The middle stage is an inductor-capacitor parallel 
configuration (LB//CB) to pull up high frequency gain. The 
output stage is a simple current buffer that gives broadband 
output impedance of 50 Ω for measurement purposes. This 
circuit was designed with Agilent’s Design System (ADS), and 
implemented in TSMC’s 0.18 μm RF CMOS technology.

the UWB LNA circuit. The S21 displays a maximum gain of 
11.7 dB at 3.1 GHz and the average S21 value over the 3.1-10.6 
GHz frequency band is 9.5 dB. With RC-feedback cascade 
topology, the bandwidth extends to cover from 3.1 to 10.6 
GHz. An excellent S12 of less than -25.7 dB was obtained due 
to effective cascode configuration. It is noted that the input 
impedance was optimized for low noise figure while keeping 
the corresponding return loss at an acceptable level.

To optimize the performance, the transistors have been sized 
to provide good noise characteristics, while allowing a good 
input impedance matching over the required bandwidth. The 
measured NF of the implemented amplifier is shown in Figure 
6. The measured NF shows a minimum value of 3.41 dB at 9 
GHz. The measured NF range was 3.41~ 4.04 dB over the 
3.1~10.6 GHz range. Figure 7 shows the two-tone test for 
third-order intermodulation distortion of the UWB CMOS 
LNA circuit. The third order input intercept point (IIP3) is -6 
dBm.
