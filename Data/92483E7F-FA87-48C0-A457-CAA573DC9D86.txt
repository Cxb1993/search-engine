~1,269,000 tons/yr in 2003 accounting for ~14% world production. The manufacture 
of fasteners involves seven important industrial processes, including the wire drawing, 
forming, threading, cleaning, heat treatment, surface treatment, and packaging and 
shipping. Among them mineral oil-based metalworking fluids (MWFs) are used in 
forming, threading, heat treatment processes for cooling, lubricating, and corrosion 
inhibition purposes and hence might result in the emission of oil mist to the workplace 
atmosphere and lead to the exposures of workers [1-2]. Considering mineral oils are 
produced by petroleum distillation processes, semi-volatile organic compounds, such 
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), are expected to be contained in MWFs. 
Epidemiological and animal studies have indicated that oil mist exposures might 
result in the laryngeal cancer [4], asthma [5], bronchial hyper-responsiveness [6], 
lipoid pneumonia [7], lung cancer [8], and many other respiratory illnesses [9-10]. 
Particularly, workers conduct industrial operations with high airborne concentrations 
of PAHs might result in excess rates of lung cancer [11-12]. In additions, intensive 
studies have also reported that all mineral oils are mutagenic to skin because of their 
inherent PAH contents [13-15]. Elovaara et al. found that the daily output of creosote 
workers’ urinary 1-hydroxylpyrene (1-OHP) exceeded their daily intake of the inhaled 
pyrene. They concluded that workers’ dermal exposures might not be negligible, 
though no dermal PAH exposures were measured in their study [16]. To date, only 
very limited studies have been conducted to address workers’ dermal exposures to 
PAHs [17-18]. To the best of our knowledge, exposure and health-risk assessment for 
workers exposed to PAHs contained in oil mists via dermal exposure route has never 
been conducted.   
In fastener manufacturing industries workers are exposed to PAHs contained in oil 
mists via both inhalatory and dermal exposure routes. Therefore, it is important to 
know the resultant lung and skin cancer risks in order to prioritize their exposure 
abatement measurements from the health risk management aspect. This study 
illustrates a useful approach to meet the above mentioned purpose. Both personal 
inhalable and dermal PAH exposures to workers in a fastener manufacturing industry 
were assessed, and the resultant lung and skin cancer risks were estimated. Finally, 
control strategies were prioritized for reducing health risks posed on workers. 
2. Material and Methods 
2.1 Personal inhalable and dermal PAH exposure samplings  
For fastener manufacturing industries, the forming, threading, and heat treatment 
processes are involved in the use of mineral oil-based MWFs for cooling, lubricating, 
and corrosion inhibition purposes. Among them, the threading workers were found 
with the highest oil mist exposures in our previous study [3], and hence were selected 
in this study for illustration. All threading workers (n=8) in the selecetd fastener 
 2
μm), an HP-7673A automatic sampler, injection volume 1 μL, splitless injection at 
310 °C, ion sources temperature at 310 °C, oven temperature from 50 °C to 100 °C at 
20 °C/min; 100 °C to 290 °C at 3 °C /min; and hold at 290 °C for 40 min. The masses 
of primary and secondary ions of PAHs were determined using the scan mode for pure 
PAH standards. Qualification of PAHs was performed using the selected ion 
monitoring (SIM) mode [17, 22-28]. 
The concentrations of 22 PAH compounds were determined, including 
naphthalene (NaP), acenaphthylene (AcPy), acenaphthene (AcP), fluorene (Flu), 
phenanthrene (PA), anthracene (Ant), fluoranthene (FL), pyrene (Pyr), 
cyclopenta[c,d]pyrene (CYC), benz[a]anthracene (BaA), chrysene (CHR), 
benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF), benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF), benz[e]pyrene (BeP), 
benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), berylene (PER), indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IND), 
dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DBA), benzo[b]chrycene (BbC), benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP), 
coronene (COR) and dibenzo[a,e]pyrene (DBP). Analysis of the serial dilution of 
PAH standards show that the limit of detection (LOD) of GC/MS was 0.093-1.51 ng. 
Five internal standards (Nap-d8, Acp-d10, PA-d10, CHR-d12, and PER-d12) were 
used to check the response factors and recovery efficiencies for PAHs analysis. The 
recovery efficiencies of 22 individual PAHs and these five internal standards were 
determined by processing a solution containing known PAH concentrations through 
the same experimental procedure that used for the analyzing samples. The recovery 
efficiency of PAHs varied between 0.786 and 0.935, and averaged 0.865 in this study. 
The above values were used to adjust the observed concentration. The mean relative 
standard deviation (RSD) (%) of recovery efficiencies was 5.13% (range 1.28-8.89%). 
The recovery efficiencies of five internal standards were between 0.791 and 0.986 and 
were fairly consistent. The blank tests for PAHs were accomplished by the same 
procedure as the recovery-efficiency tests without adding the known standard solution 
before extraction. Analysis of field blank, including filters and PUF/resin cartridges, 
showed no significant contaminant. 
2.4 Data analysis 
In this study, the concentration of total PAHs was defined as the sum of the 
concentrations of the selected 22 PAH compounds. In addition, PAH contents were 
further sorted into three categories according to their molecular weights, including the 
low molecular weight (LMW-PAHs; containing two- and three-ringed PAHs), middle 
molecular weight (MMW-PAHs; containing four-ringed PAHs), and high molecular 
weight (HMW-PAHs; containing five-, six- and seven-ringed PAHs).  
Because BaP has been known to be the most carcinogenic PAH compound, the 
carcinogenic potency of each collected sample was also determined in terms of its 
BaP equivalent concentration (BaPeq). The carcinogenic potency of the total PAHs

3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Personal inhalatory PAH exposures 
Table 3 shows that the mean gas-phase total PAHs exposure level (86,100 ng/m3) 
was much higher than that of particle-phase (2,290 ng/m3). By examining PAH 
homologue distributions for both gas-phase and particle-phase PAHs, it can be seen 
that the fractions of LMW-, MMW- and HMW-PAHs for the former were 97.1% 
(=83,600/86,100), 2.9% (=2,430/86,100), and 0% (=0/86,100), and for the latter were 
67.6% (=1,530/2,290), 20.9% (=500/2,290), and 11.5% (=257/2,290), respectively. 
Gas-phase PAHs were dominated by PAHs with lower molecular weights simply 
because of their higher volatility in comparison with those with higher molecular 
weights. Table 3 also shows that the corresponding gas-phase total BaPeq level (108 
ng/m3) was lower than the corresponding particle-bound total BaPeq level (126 ng/m3). 
The above result is because, as mentioned earlier, gas-phase PAHs were dominated by 
low molecular weight PAHs with low TEFs. On the other hand, particle-phase PAHs 
were dominated by high molecular weight PAHs. Their high TEFs results in the high 
total BaPeq levels. 
By combining both gas- and particle-phase total PAHs for describing workers’ 
personal inhalatory PAH exposures, results show that their mean exposure level 
(=110,000 ng/m3) was slightly higher than the Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) 
promulgated by the U.S. NIOSH for PAHs (=100,000 ng/m3) [41]. In our previous 
study, we have found that the mean oil mist concentration exposed to threading 
workers (=2.11mg/m3) was lower than the limit value (=5.0 mg/m3) recommended by 
NIOSH [3]. Our results clearly indicate the inadequacy of simply measuring oil mist 
concentration for assessing personal inhalatory exposures for MWFs workers. 
3.2 Personal dermal PAH exposures 
In this study, dermal PAHs exposure level for a given PAH species i on the body 
surface area j (DEij; ng /day) was determined by using equation 1: 
DEij=DCij ×AD     (1) 
Where, 
DCij=unit dermal exposure level for PAH species i collected at the body surface j 
(unit: ng/100cm2/day) 
ADj=the corresponding body surface area for the body surface area j (unit: 
100cm2)  
The unit dermal PAHs exposure level for total PAHs (i.e., the sum of 22 PAH species) 
for the body surface area j (UDEtotal,,j; ng/cm2/day) was determined by using equation 
2: 
             22 
UDEtotal,,j=Σ (DCij/100)     (2)

uncovered (or partly uncovered) by clothes had higher exposure levels than the others, 
it implies the impaction of PAHs-containing oil mists on the uncovered body surface 
areas might play important role on dermal PAH exposures. 
3.3 Health-risk assessments for both inhalatory and dermal PAH exposures 
In this study, total BaPeq levels were used to estimate the corresponding lifetime 
lung cancer risks for the studied exposure group. As shown in Table 5, the estimated 
lifetime lung cancer risks caused by inhalatory PAH exposures for threading workers 
was found as 1.64×10-2 (=234×7.0×10-5), in which 8.81×10-3 (=126×7.0×10-5; 
accounting for 53.8% of total inhalatory related lung cancer risk) and 7.55×10-3 
(=108×7×10-5; accounting for 46.2% of total inhalatory related lung cancer risk) were 
contributed by the inhalatory gas-phase PAHs and particle-phase PAH exposures, 
respectively. However, it should be noted here that the estimated health risk for 
particle-phase PAHs could be overestimated, since in this study particle-phase PAHs 
was extracted by using a solvent solution (mixture of n-hexane and dichloromethane, 
v:v = 1:1), which could be very different from that could be extracted in the 
respiratory system. This question has been investigated by three types of studies: 
extraction of carbon black in vitro [42], extration of carbon black containingg added 
PAHs (usually BaP) in vitro [43], and elution in the presence of mammalian cells or 
cells constituents in vivo and in vitro [44]. It was thought the bioavailability of the 
particle-phase PAHs was very low when they were contained in or absorbed by 
particles. However, a study conducted by Strom showed that as both retention time 
and particle burden in the lungs increased, it might result in the increase of PAH 
elution potential [45]. At this stage, the elution rate of particle-phase PAHs deposited 
in lung still remains unknown which warrants the needs for further investigation in the 
future. 
Table 5 also shows whole body dermal total BaPeq exposure level and its resultant 
skin cancer risk. To date, desorption rates for particle-phase PAHs deposited on the 
skin surface still remains unknown. However, US EPA has suggested a maximum of 
20% of PAHs that adsorbed onto soil could be desorbed onto the skin in 24 hours [46]. 
Since no desorption rate was available for particle-phase PAHs that contained in oil 
mists, the above value was adopted in this study. Assuming workers experienced 25 
years employment (5 days per week, 50 weeks per year) during a life span of 70 years, 
and their body weights were the same as that for the standard man (=70 kg). The 
resultant lifetime averaged dermal total BaPeq exposure levels for threading workers 
were 0.259 µg/kg/day (=371000*10-3*20%*5*50*25/70/(70*365)). In this study, the 
unit risk of 37.47×10-3 (µg/kg /day)-1 suggested by Hussain et al. [38] for BaP was 
adopted to estimate the lifetime skin cancer risk associated with the dermal PAHs 
exposures. The estimated lifetime skin cancer risk was 9.71×10-3 (=0.259×37.47×10-3),
