thickness and screw spacing as FF specimen. The predicted values computed based on the AISI 
Specification seem to be conservative as compared to the tested values of FF specimens. 
Therefore, it is suggested that the effective length factor, K (Kx, Ky, and Kt), can be taken as 0.5 
to determine the wall stud assembly strength.

二、與會心得
由於環保的考量，木材、砂石等材料的短缺，目前許多國家，如美國、日本、英國
與澳洲等，正積極地推動中低層輕鋼構住宅。以美國為例，在 1992 年推動初期，僅有
500 棟此類建築興建，在 1998 年一年間已有 12 萬棟住宅使用輕鋼構建築，約佔當年住
宅建築的 10 %，而在 2000年，其輕鋼構住宅將達一年 20萬戶的規模(約佔當年住宅建
築的 20 %)。而日本更是在短短的幾年間，在鋼鐵製造業共同的努力下結盟成立協會(鋼
材俱樂部)，不但進行生產、製造及推廣，同時亦進行研究發展工作，讓所謂的鋼屋(steel
house)市場在日本蓬勃發展，2001 年間日本僅有 6000 戶的興建，2003 年業已有 5 萬戶
的規模，也因此，此次會議特加入了Wall Studs（牆立柱）與 Building Systems（建築系
統）之課題，以因應目前市場之需求。
本次會議舉辦兩日，會議於首日(11月 26日)早上 8:00準時開始，本以為至會場之參
加者必如研討會一般珊珊來遲，沒想到去時發現會場已是鴉鴉烏九成滿，著實讓人吃驚
不少。而自己所發表之場次安排於第二天下午(11月 27日，Session 9)，依在台灣參加研
討會或會議之經驗，一般估計與會聽眾相信不會太多，雖然當日洽臨星期五，可是出人
意表的是參加人數依然如第一天相當，著實讓人不得不打起精神努力發表論文，亦全程
參與至會議結束。此次會議的參與，除了發表論文外，亦讓自己收穫不少，相信對未來
相關領域的發展與研究方向有更深之了解外，也同時又有一番之看法與領悟。

4the effective net section is less than the tensile strength of the steel. The main
factor considered in the AISC Specification (1999) for computing the
effective net area is the shear lag effect. Shear lag effect occurs when some
elements of the tension member are not connected. This effect reduces the
strength of the member because the stresses distributed over the entire section
are not uniform (Easterling and Giroux, 1993). The average value of stresses
on the net section may thus be less than the tensile strength of the steel. The
reduced strength of the member can be expressed as the efficiency of the net
section. Research reported by Munse and Chesson (1963) suggests that the
shear lag effect can be accounted for by using a reduced net area. Based on
this assumption, AISC Specification (1999) states that the effective net area,
Ae, of such a member is to be determined by multiplying its net area (if
bolted or riveted) by a reduction factor U, that is, when the tension load is
transmitted only by fasteners:
Ae = UAn (1)
where U = reduction factor = 1.0- x /L < 0.9 (2)
x = connection eccentricity
L = length of the connection in the direction of loading
Due to the variety of cross sectional shapes for cold-formed steel
members, it is not normally possible or convenient to connect each element to
the end connection. Currently, the design formulas of the 1996 AISI
Specification do not consider the effect of shear lag. So, as described in the
AISI Specification, the nominal tensile strength (Tn) of axially loaded
cold-formed steel tension members is simply determined by the net area of
the cross section (An) and the yield stress of steel (Fy):
Tn = AnFy (3)
When a bolted connection is used, the nominal tensile strength is further
limited by the capacity specified in Specification Section E3.2 (1996). Based
on the research finding by LaBoube and Yu (1995), design equations have
been proposed and adopted in AISI Specification Supplement No.1 (1999) to
estimate the influence of shear lag. The same design provisions are now
included in Section E3.2 of Appendices A and C of the 2001 edition of the
North American Specification for the use in the USA and Mexico. The design
criteria for the channel and angle sections under axial tension load are listed
as follows:
Pn = AeFu (4)
where Fu = tensile strength of the connected part
Ae = UAn, effective net area with U defined as follows:
U = for angle members having two or more bolts in the line of
force = 1.0-1.20 x /L < 0.9 but shall not be less than 0.4 (5)
x = connection eccentricity (distance from shear plane to centroid
of the cross section)
6The test material used in this study is SSC400 sheet steel specified in
Chinese National Standard (1994) with a nominal ultimate tensile strength of
41 kgf/mm2 (400 N/mm2) and up. Two different thicknesses, 2.3 mm and 3.2
mm, of sheet steels were used to fabricate the specimens. The material
properties of both steels were obtained by tensile coupon tests. The yield
stress and tensile strength of the 3.2 mm–thick sheet steel are 314.10 MPa
and 434.24 MPa, respectively. And for the 2.3 mm–thick sheet steel, the yield
stress and tensile strength are 324.20 MPa and 438.53 MPa, respectively. The
fasteners used to connect the L-shaped specimens were ASTM A325T high
strength bolts.
2.1 Specimens
For the selection of the dimensions of cross sections, the specimens
were designed to have a failure type of fracture on the net cross section, so
that the shear lag effect can be evaluated. The specimens were also
numerically verified to avoid bearing failure of cross section and bearing
failure and shear failure of the bolt. Three groups of specimens were used to
conduct in this study:
Group A: L-shaped section with a nominal connected leg width of 100
mm and nominal unconnected leg width of 50 mm.
(AA-100503.2 and AB-100502.3)
Group B: L-shaped section with a nominal connected leg width of 100
mm and nominal unconnected leg width of 100 mm.
(BA-1001003.2 and BB-1001002.3)
Group C: L-shaped section with a nominal connected leg width of 100
mm and nominal unconnected leg width of 120 mm.
(CA-1001203.2 and CB-1001202.3)
Two L-shaped sections were assembled back to back by using four
high-strength bolts. A total of 12 pairs of sections were connected using two
bolts in two lines of force. In addition, another 12 pairs of sections were
connected using four bolts in one line of force. The spacing between the
centers of bolt holes, 40 mm, was chosen to be larger than three times the bolt
diameter. The distance from the end of the specimen to the nearest center of
bolt hole, 20 mm, was designed to be larger than 1.5 times the bolt diameter
according to the AISI Specification. All holes were drilled to 14.3 mm in
diameter, and were accommodated with 12.7 mm diameter ASTM A325T
bolts as a bearing-type connection.
2.2 Test Setup
A tensile testing machine with a capacity of 50 tons was used to conduct
all the tests. The configuration of test setup is shown in Figure 1. Two
L-shaped sections in same group were assembled back to back by using four
8to computed tensile strengths can be improved. It seems that the amended
formula (Equation (5)) gives a better result for L-shaped tension members
having two bolts in the line of force.
3.2 Comparison with BS Specification
The comparisons between test values and the computed tensile strength
based on the BS Specification are listed in Table 3. The computed tensile
strengths listed in Table 3 were calculated according to Equation 6. It can be
seen from Table 3 that the mean value of Ptest/Pn ratios (tested to computed
tensile strength ratios) is 0.884 with a standard deviation of 0.110. The scatter
between the tested and predicted values of tensile strength is probably due to
the lack of consideration of the connection length and type, even though the
areas of connected and unconnected elements of the member are considered
in the calculation of tensile strength for the BS Specification.
3.3 Comparison with AS/NSZ Specification
The predicted tensile strength for each specimen according to the
AS/NSZ Specification are listed in column (2) of Table 4. It was observed
from Table 4 that the ratios of tested to computed tensile strength for each
specimen are between 0.643 and 0.955. For the specimens with larger width
of unconnected leg, the ratios varied from 0.643 to 0.695. Thus the tensile
strength is much overestimated for the specimens with larger width of
unconnected leg tested in this study. The equation (Equation 7) for predicting
the tensile strength of a tension member is quite simple and convenient to use.
However, failure to consider the connection length may have caused the
discrepancies between the tested and computed values of tensile strength.
3.4 Comparison with AISC Specification
Table 5 compares tested tensile strengths with values according to the
AISC Specification. The predicted tensile strength for each specimen is
determined by Pn2 and listed in column (2) of Table 5. The range of values for
the ratio of tested to computed values for the specimens is from 1.339 to
2.851. It can be seen from Table 5 that the mean value of Ptest/Pn ratios (tested
to computed tensile strength ratios) is 1.894 with a standard deviation of
0.591. The computed values calculated based on the AISC Specification
provide bad correlation with the test results. Contrary, the current AISC
Specification is a relatively good predictor of the tensile strength for the
channel tension members (Pan, 2004).
4. Model Construction
Because the axial force in the main portion of the L-shaped member is
eccentric with respect to the connected ends, bending can also be present.
This portion of study is concentrated on proposing a model that is more
efficient than the currently used ones. The efficiency factor proposed here is
10
to conduct the non-linear transformation between layers. For the output layer,
PURELIN function (linear mapping between layers) was adopted. The initial
weight was randomly generated by the toolbox. According to Pan’s
recommendation (2004), the ratio of connection eccentricity to connection
length, x /L, and the ratio of unconnected elements to connected elements,
Wu/Wc, are the two factors which can mainly influence the tensile strength of
channel sections. Therefore, the input vectors used to compute the reduction
factor (U) are x1/L, x2/L, and Wu/Wc. The target values are the tested ultimate
load of specimens including the data conducted in this study and Holcomb’s
test results (1995). After 10,000 epochs, the mean squared error (MSE) was
reaching 0.028. In order to guarantee a convergence, the learning rate was set
a small value 0.001 with dynamically modification. The learning result is
listed in Table 6. The result shows that the constructed BP performed well in
data mapping.
5. Conclusions
In order to investigate the effect of shear lag on the C-shaped
cold-formed steel sections, four groups of specimens were tested under
tension. A total of 12 pairs of sections were tested in this study. Based on the
test specimens having the failure mode of net section fracture, the following
conclusions can be drawn for the L-shaped cold-formed steel tension
members:
1. From observing the strain readings in the test, it is apparent that the
stress distribution over the entire section of the specimen is not uniform.
The stresses in the connected leg are larger than the stresses in the
unconnected leg. Thus, the effect of shear lag is demonstrated, and the
effect of eccentricity noted
2. It was found that the tensile strengths of test specimens predicted by the
AISC Code (1999), which takes into account the shear lag effect, provide
bad correlation with the test results. The predictions according to AISI
Specification (1996) and AS/NZS Standard (1996) seem to be
overestimated as compared to the test results. However, the predicted
values calculated according to the 2001 AISI Specification gives a better
result for L-shaped tension members. It was also noted that there is quite
a discrepancy between the test results and the values predicted by British
Standard (1998). The scatter between the tested and predicted values of
tensile strength is probably due to the lack of consideration of the
connection length and type.
3. Artificial neural network might be a computational tool that can be used
to predict the strength of cold-formed steel tensile member.
Bacppropagation network is adopted to construct the mapping models in
this study. The result shows that the constructed BP performed well in
data mapping. However, more test data for the angle sections need to be
investigated to see whether they also meet this finding.
