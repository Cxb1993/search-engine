High-rise buildings possess characteristics of light-weighted, high strength, large aspect 
ratio, long period and low damping. They are therefore quite sensitive to wind disturbances. As a 
result, it has become a critical issue in the field of civil and structural engineering to try to reduce 
wind-induced displacement and acceleration responses for serviceability. Tuned Liquid Column 
Damper (TLCD) is a nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom system possessing advantageous 
features such as easy-tuning and dual functions for fire protection and vibration control. The 
objective of this study is to establish an analytical model for dynamic analysis of nonlinear TLCD 
systems, and fabricate both a TLCD and VTLCD device for component tests as well as 
performance tests. Results by component tests indicate good agreement of the fundamental 
frequency with the theoretical prediction, and the headloss is found to be dependent on both the 
orifice size and disturbing frequency. Performance tests, regardless of free vibration or harmonic
