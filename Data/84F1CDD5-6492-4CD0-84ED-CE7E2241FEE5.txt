一、中文摘要 
在現實生活中，很多實務的原因使得存
貨管理者儲存物品超過自有倉庫(記為OW)
的庫存容量(當銷售量增加而造成倉庫容量
不敷使用時)，此時，零售商會考慮租用另一
倉庫(記為RW)。因此，兩倉庫模式的研究者
認為當企業自有倉庫空間不足以支應儲存需
求時,可選擇在鄰近租倉儲放,透過決策,其
所決定的生產或採購批量將優於(至少不劣
於)一倉庫政策。為了提升存貨模式的實用
性，本研究針對現有兩倉庫存貨問題做一延
伸，探討當供應商提供零售商大量訂購才允
許信用交易的策略下，零售商該如何訂定退
化性商品在兩倉庫存貨模式的最佳訂購策
略，以使其存貨總成本為最低?同時，並探討
總成本函數是否具有凸性？若不具有凸性，
是否具有某種函數特性？在上述討論下，試
著發展一些簡單、正確並易執行之演算法，
供實務界使用。最後，以數值範例來闡明理
論的結果及探討系統中參數變動對最佳解的
敏感度分析。 
Abstract 
In real-life, there exist many practical 
cases that force inventory managers to hold 
more items than can be stored in own a 
warehouse (denoted by OW). Here, one 
additional warehouse is required. This 
additional warehouse may be a rented 
warehouse (denoted by RW) and the renting 
cost of a rented warehouse is seemed as an 
additional cost of business. From the practical 
point of view, the supplier proposes a certain 
credit period when the order quantity is more 
than a quantity at which the delay in payments 
is permitted. Here, when the retailer orders 
quantity more than the own warehouse, these 
excess quantities may stored in a rented 
warehouse. Therefore, this study will 
investigate that payment delays depend on the 
quantity ordered and according to such 
phenomenon, if the order quantity exceeds the 
owned warehouse capacity, it will be necessary 
to rent a warehouse which results in a rental 
cost of business is arrived. Otherwise, renting a 
warehouse is unnecessary. Finally, we provide 
the optimal ordering policy for the 
decision-maker to decision whether or not to 
rent RW for sale environment which is the 
Chung and Huang (2006) considered a 
two-warehouse inventory problem for 
deteriorating item with limited shortage space 
under permissible delay in payments. However, 
in certain practical situations, trade credits can 
be applied as an alternative to price discounts 
to order more quantities. Consequently, an 
important problem associated with inventory 
maintenance is deciding whether to rent an 
additional warehouse to hold more items to 
obtain a trade credit period. 
Based on the above arguments, this study 
incorporates both Chung and Huang (2006) and 
Chung and Liao (2004) under above conditions. 
This study considers payment delay to depend 
on order quantity where the order quantity is 
less than that at which delayed payment is 
permitted, meaning payment must be made 
immediately. Otherwise, the fixed trade credit 
period is permitted. Additionally, if the order 
quantity exceeds owned warehouse capacity it 
becomes necessary to rent a warehouse which 
results in an additional rental cost is arrived. 
Given this marketing situation, this study 
develops a deterministic inventory model for 
deteriorating items with two warehouses (one is 
OW and the other is RW) and where trade 
credit is linked to order quantity. This study 
then demonstrates easy-to-use theorems to 
identify the optimal replenishment cycle time 
and the optimal order lot-size to minimize. 
Numerical examples are used to illustrate all of 
the study theorems and revealed the decision 
whether to rental an additional warehouse. 
Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal 
solution with respect to the parameters of the 
system is carried out and some important 
managerial insights are obtained.
