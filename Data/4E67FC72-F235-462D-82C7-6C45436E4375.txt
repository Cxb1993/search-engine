Introduction
For the last two decades, organic luminescent materials have been attracting
attention in applications like organic light-emitting devices and organic lasers because
of their flexibility, low processing temperature, and broad emitting spectrum in the
visible range [1]. Characteristics of photonic crystals are another intriguing research
topic due to the specific band gap structure [2]. By using the structures as laser
cavities, light emission and propagation can be engineered. Although most researches
are done with semiconductor lasers, Meier et al. in 1999 reported the optical pumped
lasing action in two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal structure with organic gain
media and showed the importance of a saddle point in the k space concerning
photonic crystal laser [3,4]. The detail of feedback in the photonic crystal laser has
been demonstrated by Notomi et al. later [5].
In this paper, we report a study of lasing characteristics of a composite organic
thin-film laser with gain medium of 4-(Dicyanomethylene)-2-tertbutyl-6-(1, 1, 7,
7-tetramethyljulolidin-4-yl-vinyl)-4H-pyran (DCJTB) doped in
Poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) on a 2D photonic crystal structure of triangular lattice.
The wave propagates forwardly and backwardly will be coupled by periodic
structure like grating or corrugation-induced dielectric perturbation. To understand the
operational characteristics of a 2D-DFB laser, we consider the 1D-DFB structure first.
Fig. 1 shows the typically periodic structure with the perturbation of refractive index
n(z) and amplitude gainα(z)which can written as

whereλB is the Bragg wavelength, this is known as Bragg equation.

The order of Bragg diffraction m plays an important role in DFB lasers. By
choosing the suitable order, a surface emitting laser would be achieved. We can regard
the DFB structure as diffraction grating and realize the significance of the order of
Bragg diffraction m by the diffraction equation:

where 0, 1, 2,...dm    are the diffraction order, θm is the diffraction angle of mth
order, andθp is the angle of propagating wave (λ) in the grating. From this equation, it
is obvious that the difractive angle is depending on the grating period Λ and effective
refractive index neff when the incident angle of propagating wave is constant. This
tells us that one can control the direction of diffractive wave by selecting proper
parameters (i.e.Λand neff).
For example, if the parameters of effective refractive index neff and incident wave
of λand θi are still the same, but change the grating period as Λ=400 nm, (6) will
become sinθm = 1 + md. The solution satisfied this equation will be md = -1, -2. In
other words, at every periodic interval Λ, diffractive wave will propagate in two
different directions. As md = -1, the diffractive angle is 0°, the diffractive wave will
propagate out of the grating perpendicularly to the surface; as md = -2, the diffractive
angle is -90, that is the direction of diffractive wave is counter to the propagating

Lasing threshold
Fig. 13 shows the emission spectrum at different pumping energy withλpeak = 621
nm. As the pumping energy increases, the emission spectra get narrowed and grow
rapidly. We plot the (a) output intensity and (b) FWHM of Fig. 13 depending on
different pumping energy shown in Fig. 14. It is apparent that when the pumping
energy was at 4.67 μJ, the output intensity suddenly grew rapidly and lasing
phenomenon was observed. Furthermore as pumping energy was higher than 6.89μJ,
the saturation occurred that can be deduced from the output intensity in Fig. 13 and
the FWHM of the spectrum widths in Fig. 14.

Conclusion
We use the organic dye DCJTB doped in the matrix of PVK as the gain medium.
The organic thin-film laser with 2D photonic crystal is made by spin casting an
organic thin film onto a 2D photonic crystal structure with triangular lattice fabricated
by E-beam lithography and dry etching. The lattice constant is 405 5 nm with air
holes of radius 150 5 nm. Lasing phenomenon is observed at threshold pumping
energy of 6.7 μJ at the peak wavelength of 621 nm. The FWHM is indicated as 4.22 
nm due to the limitation on the dynamic range of the CCD spectrometer. The
calculated band diagram of lasing action at the peak wavelength of 622 nm shows
good agreement with measured wavelength of 621 nm.
The investigation of 2D photonic crystal laser has not yet completed, like
determine the influence of hole size (or shape) and the polarization of lasing beam.
The fabrication of 2D photonic crystal structure by e-beam lithography requests a lot
of time and cost. If we can develop the nano-imprint lithography6, the procedure of
2D photonic crystal structure can be much simplified. Another fascinating issue is
the possibility of three dimensional distributed feedback lasers7. It might have more
effective output beam, lower threshold energy, and good collimation of lasing beam.
