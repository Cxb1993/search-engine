This leads to that the three-step search 
may give a result worse than the motion 
vector obtained from the last iteration. To 
avoid this happen, we designed a dual 
three-step search algorithm in which a 
second three-step search is conditionally 
executed to find a new motion vector. By 
this way a motion vector better than the 
one from the last iteration can always be 
found. This project uses the bilinear 
transformation to perform the image 
warping task. We change the viewpoint 
from pixel position to pixel motion vector 
so that the motion vector at a point can be 
considered as the addition of the motion 
vectors at the control nodes of the point 
multiplied with their control rates. We 
derived the control rates for three types of 
nodes defined in the proposed MCHM: 
the general nodes (GN), the special node 
(SN) and the boundary node (BN). By this 
method the image warping from a regular 
hierarchical mesh is simply accomplished 
by using the control rate of each node. For 
the image warping from a non-regular 
hierarchical mesh, we proposed a novel 
indirect method. Firstly the texture of an 
intermediate regular mesh is obtained 
from the first non-regular mesh by 
backward warping that using the control 
rate of the intermediate regular mesh. 
Then the texture of the intermediate 
regular mesh is forward warped to 
produce the texture of the second 
non-regular frame by using the control 
rate of the intermediate regular mesh. In 
each of the above two warping process, a 
regular mesh is always involved and 
therefore can be accomplished by using 
the control rate formulae for the regular 
mesh. 
Experiments including the intra mode 
and the inter mode were conducted to test 
our proposed method. Experiment results 
comparing the proposed MCHM and other 
methods in terms of PSNR under the same  
node number were demonstrated. The 
results show that the PSNR of the former 
is about 1dB higher than that of the latter 
under the same number of the nodes. 
 
一.緣由與目的 
Motion compensation is used to reduce 
temporal redundancy in video 
compression and the block-matching 
algorithm (BMA) is the most popular 
technique used for motion estimation. But 
there are some drawbacks in BMA: 1) it 
cannot handle image rotations and scaling 
and 2) it cannot preserve the neighboring 
relations between the blocks, resulting in 
blocking artifacts [17]. A new motion 
compensation method named “Mesh” was 
developed in MPGE-4 to overcome the 
drawbacks in the BMA and offer high 
compression rate. In the mesh-based 
coding scheme, motion compensation 
within each mesh element is accomplished 
by more general spatial transformation 
related  to  the  eometry of  the  
mesh  element  [5,6,15,18,21]. The 
mesh method synthesizes image 
transfiguration/deformation with the 
motion trajectories of the node in the 
mesh thus offers a mechanism for video 
compression. 
reconstruct it in very high quality.  
 
二.研究方法 
Fig. 1 illustrates the flow chart of our 
mesh generation in which both intra and 
inter modes are considered. In the intra 
mode, a new motion complexity 
hierarchical mesh (MCHM) is generated. 
Then the geometry of the generated 
HCHM is encoded. In the inter mode, the 
displacement (motion vector) of each 
node of the hierarchical mesh is estimated 
by motion estimation. Then the 
incremental hierarchical mesh of the inter 
frame is produced by mesh updating 
which moves a node to its new position 
using its motion vector.

mesh generator- intra and inter modes. 
 
Three levels of motion estimation: 
level-1 motion estimation (L1ME), level-2 
motion estimation (L2ME) and level-3 
motion estimation (L3ME) are used in  
Fig. 1. The L1ME and L2ME are the 
simplified versions of the L3ME. They are 
all based on the three-step search but with 
different interpolation methods and with 
enforcing the convergence of motion 
vectors or without. In the L3ME, linear 
interpolation is used and the convergence 
of  motion  vectors  is  enforced.   
In The L2ME, nearest-neighborhood 
interpolation is used and the convergence 
of  motion  vectors  is  enforced.   
In the L1ME, nearest-neighborhood 
interpolation is used and the convergence 
of motion vectors is not enforced. 
In our method, motion estimation is 
based on the conventional three-step 
search [9] with some improvement. The 
purpose of search is to find an optimal 
motion vector that is defined as the one 
giving the minimum mean square error 
between the warped and the objective 
frames [29,30,31]. The three-step search is 
an efficient method for motion estimation, 
but with some problems. First, the result 
of the three-step search is not always 
optimal due to falling in local minima. 
Second, the search range is only from -6 
to 6, it is not enough to handle images 
with high motion. In this project, the 
above problems will be solved as follows. 
In the level-2 and level-3 motion 
estimation the convergence condition is 
enforced to give optimal result. Therefore 
the motion vector of a node may be 
iteratively estimated many times. If the 
three-step search is applied only once it 
may give a result worse than the motion 
vector obtained from the last iteration. To 
quadrangle. When the location of a node 
is on the boundary of an image frame and 
only one or two patches of the same size 
joins the node, the node is also defined as 
a GN. A SN is jointed by four patches of 
different size. The control area of a SN is 
a polygon but not a quadrangle. When the 
location of a node is on the boundary of 
an image frame and only two patches of 
different size joins this node, the node is 
considered as SN. A BN has three patches 
joining the node and the node is located at 
the vertex of two patches and at the 
boundary of the other patch. 
Image warping from a regular 
hierarchical mesh presented above is 
accomplished by using the control rate of 
each node. But the calculation of the 
control rate of a node in a non-regular 
hierarchical mesh is more complicated 
and an analytical formula is hard to obtain. 
In this project, the image warping from a 
non-regular hierarchical mesh is 
accomplished through an indirect method 
as follows. Firstly the texture of an 
intermediate regular mesh is obtained 
from the N th frame by backward 
warping that using the control rate of the 
intermediate regular mesh. Then the 
texture of the intermediate regular mesh is 
forward warped to produce the texture of 
the )1( +N th frame by using the control 
rate of the intermediate regular mesh. In 
each of the above two warping process, a 
regular mesh is always involved and 
therefore can be accomplished by using 
the control rate formulae for the regular 
mesh.
