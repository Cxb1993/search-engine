ABSTRACT 
Objective: The objective of this study was to develop an automatic data-mining tool, 
which transformed medical references in a digital archive of biomedical and life 
sciences journal literature into a knowledge-representing structure.  
Methods: The abstracts of biomedical articles were constructed into a PICO format 
that was able to represent the concepts of data collection, analysis, and interpretation 
contained in each article. Attributes including journal names, study types, case 
inclusion and number, association methods, effect size, stability of association, and 
amplitudes and direction of the conclusion were extracted. Evidence as judged by 
experts was categorized into A, B, and C. Classification machines were applied and 
an algorithm was used to perform automated classification. 
Results: The rank of a journal by impact factors was the most important predictor 
for Level A evidence. Research types fairly separated the evidence into different 
levels. Case number, p-value, and confidence interval also provided additional 
discriminative capacity.  
Future work: The near-future work will be a test and training process to evaluate 
the accuracy of the automated algorithms in differentiating evidence levels.  
Conclusion: We have developed a conceptualized database for evidence-base 
medicine and enabled the evidence foundation for medical experts to develop 
clinical guidelines and recommendations in panel discussion.

並從醫學文件中尋找”語意類型(semantic type)”和“關聯性(relations)”，以適合
醫學領域的答詢系統的特色。PICO 的內容可以對應到不同的語意類型。 
    此外，Demner-Fushman 和 Lin(University of Maryland)使用初級來源
(MEDLINE database, abstracts of general articles)來進行資訊擷取，用 PICO 的
format描述結構化的詢問(query) ，並從MEDLINE 摘要中自動擷取出相對應的
frames。研究者使用現有的軟體(MetaMap, SemRep, etc.)來找出文件中的醫學概念
(concepts)及其關聯性(relations)；並運用 coarser-grained semantic types[3]來獲得較
高階的推論(generalization)。設計”population extractor”，根據規則(rule-based 
methods)來找尋有關受試者(母群、人數)的語意；”problem extractor”用來認知與
疾病種類有關的概念； “intervention/comparison extractor”產生與該研究相關的治
療/處置有關的項目列表；而”outcome extractor”在語句的層次，進行分類
(classification)工作，預測該句子是否描述結果。文獻中的概念及語意關聯，都使
用 UMLS 的標準化定義(standards)。UMLS 是 1986 年初，由美國國家醫學圖書
館（National Library of Medicine，簡稱 NLM）開始著手的一個長期的研發計劃。
由於生物醫學資訊不斷大量的增加且分散於各個資料庫系統，因此想要查檢完整
而新穎的資訊殊為不易，是故 UMLS應運而生，其目的在提昇系統之能力，使
系統能了解讀者在生物醫學方面的問題意涵，並進而幫助讀者檢索及整合相關資
訊。UMLS 著重在解決二個影響有效檢索的問題：1) 同一概念經由不同的人或
在不同的資料庫中可能會有不同的表達方式；2) 資料庫系統分散所造成的檢索
不完整的問題。換言之，UMLS 試圖在讀者問題與資料來源間建立概念上的連
結。UMLS 創造出一個界面環境，負起三項主要功能： 1) 具備詮釋讀者問題
的能力；2) 具備判斷並連結相關資料庫的人工智慧；3) 執行有效檢索的能力。
為達到前述三項功能，UMLS 系統中設計了泛索引典(Metathesaurus)和語意網路
(Semantic Network)二個知識庫來達成系統在檢索問題(query)與各資料庫系統中
所存有之大量生物醫學文獻間建立概念上的關聯；而資訊來源圖(Information 
Source Map)的建置，可以幫助讀者判斷並建議合於讀者檢索需求之資料庫；至
於專家語典(Specialist Lexicon)則主要應用於提供各項語詞資料，以幫助系統處理
自然語言所產生的語法差異的問題[4]。 
    之後 Demner-Fushman 和 Lin再依據擷取內容做為判斷實證強度的依據[5]。
雖然說MEDLINE 中一篇文件的實證等級，可以由刊登型式”publication type” 
(review, original articles, case reports, etc.)，以及 MeSH heading 中所指稱的研究方
式(randomized control trials, cohort study, case-control studies, etc.)，即可初略得
知。然而，進行醫學文獻評讀(critical appraisal)，才是評判一篇文獻的實證等級
的最重要步驟；因此，必須從文獻摘要(abstract)的敘述性文字(narration)中，擷取
出病例數(case number)，受試者特性(study participants)，統計方法(statistical 
methods)，隨機分派(randomization)，雙盲實驗(blinding)，病例追蹤(quality of 
follow up)等重要資訊，才能進行有效的實證等級判定[6]。

Abstract: Introduction: The objective of this study was to develop and apply an automated 
acquisition system (AAS) for assessing quality of care (QC) measures for cardiovascular diseases.
Methods: An AAS combining both keyword search and natural language processing algorithms was 
developed to extract QC measures from electronic discharge notes of a tertiary medical center in 
Taiwan from 2002 to 2004, and produced the attainment rate to current standards of care. A 
cardiologist was asked to read the EDN and his assessment was used as the gold standard. 
Results: The system was able to reach an agreement rate (κ value) with the expert from 0.70 
(angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor use) to 0.96 (β-blocker at discharge) in the patients with 
ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The accuracy was reproducible (κ value from 0.65 to 
0.97) when the same algorithm was applied to the patients with unstable angina or non-ST-
segment elevation myocardial infarction. In the patients receiving coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery, the QC measures could be automatically retrieved.
Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that a novel AAS can be used to extract QC 
measures for cardiovascular diseases with accuracy, and to provide a reliable tool for determining 
quality of care.

4the objective of this study was to apply information retrieval technology to develop an 
automated acquisition system (AAS) for assessing QC measures for CVD, to validate 
the accuracy of the system, and to demonstrate its generalization to other applications.
METHODS
Study materials
Our institution, a 2400-bed university-affiliated teaching hospital is a tertiary 
referral center for CVD. Residents taking care of the inpatients are required to use 
English to write a discharge note into a word processor that is incorporated into the 
hospital CIS. Each discharge note is structured into the following fields: chart number, 
name, sex, birthday, department, admission date, discharge date, transfer to intensive 
care unit (Transfer), diagnosis at admission (InDx), diagnosis at discharge (OutDx), 
diagnosis in ICU, chief complaint, present illness, physical examination, operation, 
in-hospital course, complications, laboratory data (Lab), radiology reports, condition 
at discharge, pathology, and discharge orders (Discharge). The narrations of all the 
discharge notes from 2002 to 2004 were exported from hospital CIS into an ACCESS 
database [6]. Echocardiographic reports (in narrative forms) and laboratory test results 
were imported from other parts of CIS into related fields during EDN composition.
This use of CIS data was approved by the Institutional Review Board.
Quality of care measures
Parameters that could be readily retrieved from EDN were used to measure the 
process of quality of care in the patients with STEMI, UA/NSTEMI, and in those who 
underwent CABG. The universally used measures included: 1) the proportion of 
aspirin use after discharge in the patients without contraindications, 2) the proportion 
6Training set
The searching strategy using 1) keywords like “acute myocardial infarction” or 
“STEMI” in the fields “InDx” or “OutDx” and 2) a non-empty “Transfer” field
(indicating a transfer to cardiac care unit), was applied to find documented cases with 
STEMI. These cases were carefully reviewed and the process and outcome of quality 
care was measured [6]. A cardiologist was asked to validate each item of QC measures 
point by point and case by case as the gold standard. 
Test set
Keyword search like “acute coronary syndrome,” “unstable angina,” “non-ST 
segment elevation myocardial infarction,” “UA,” and “NSTEMI” in the fields of 
“InDx” and “OutDx” was used to retrieve cases with UA/NSTEMI. The same 
cardiologist was asked to review all the retrieved cases and confirmed the diagnosis. 
The QC measures determined by the AAS were used as the test set and compared to 
those determined by the cardiologist. 
Application set
All the records containing “coronary artery bypass graft” or “CABG” in the 
“Operation” field were retrieved from the database. All the QC measures were 
determined automatically by the AAS and then reported.
Automated acquisition system
An information-retrieval tool was developed to extract QC measures from EDN. 
This automated engine could receive narrative inputs and produce coded data as 
outputs that were ready for computation and data-mining. 
8rules applied to each class were diagramed in Figure 2. Technical details will be 
reported elsewhere. The fulfillment to each QC measure was determined at the end of 
each decision branch [test positive (T+) and test negative (T-)]. 
Statistics
The attainment rates of the above-mentioned QC measures were presented in 
percentages. The proportion was calculated after the patients with a contraindication 
were excluded from the denominator.
In the training set and the test set, the cardiologist’s opinions were used as the 
standard (D+ and D-) and the interpretation from the AAS was used as the test results 
(T+ and T-). The agreement between system evaluation and human expertise was 
judged by κ values. A κ value greater than 0.40, 0.60, and 0.80 was regarded as 
moderate, substantial, and almost perfect agreement between the two retrieval 
methods, respectively. Sensitivity [probability(T+|D+)] and specificity
[probability(T-|D-)] for each QC measure were also reported.
In the application set, the AAS was used to perform information retrieval from 
END and report the attainment rate of each QC measure.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Between 2002 and 2004, there were 281 cases with documented STEMI (227 
men, mean age: 60±14 and 54 women, mean age: 73±12), 627 cases with 
UA/NSTEMI (431 men, mean age: 66±12 and 196 women, mean age: 73±9), and 645 
10
(8.5%), atrial fibrillation (5.7%), asystole (5.3%), ventricular septal defect (1.8%), 
cardiac tamponade (0.7%) and cardiac rupture (0.4%).
The attainment rate to other QC measures for STEMI ranged from 0.26 (statin 
use during admission) to 0.95 (aspirin at discharge) by the standards used. Agreement 
rate, sensitivity, and specificity of the system performance on STEMI were shown in 
Table 2.
Test results
The algorithm in the AAS was no longer modified after the training set was 
applied. The discharge notes of the patients experiencing UA/NSTEMI were then
input into the system. It was found that 55% of the patients underwent coronary 
angioplasty (early intervention) during admission and the remaining 45% received 
conservative treatment. Among them, 86% survived to discharge and the other 14% 
required CABG or expired at the end of medical treatment. The attainment rate of 
others QC measures for UA/NSTEMI ranged from 0.34 (statin use during admission) 
to 0.95 (aspirin at discharge) by gold standard. The agreement between the system and 
the expert was all almost perfect (κ values: 0.82~0.97) in all measures except that the 
differentiation between early intervention and conservative management was 
substantial (κ value: 0.65). Agreement rate, sensitivity, and specificity were shown in 
Table 3.
The assessment by the AAS revealed that the LDL check-up rate during 
admission was 75.6%. Complications associated with UA/NSTEMI included shock
(18.5%), pulmonary edema (12.4%), bradycardia (11.5%), atrial fibrillation (9.4%), 
pneumonia (7.8%), asystole (1.6%), ventricular septal defect (1.0%), and cardiac 
12
were used less frequently in patients with NSTEMI [18]. The Can Rapid Risk 
Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress ADverse Outcomes with Early 
Implementation (CRUSADE) Quality Improvement Initiative was developed as a 
registry for NSTEMI/UA to track the use of guideline-based acute and discharge 
treatments for hospitalized patients, as well as outcomes associated with the use of 
these treatments [19].
In our previous study, we illustrated a particular QC pattern for STEMI at our 
institution as compared to the results in US standards, i.e., an extra-ordinary early 
reperfusion rate, adequate use of anti-platelet agents and ACE-I/ARB, and poor 
performance in -blocker usage and lipid management [6]. This phenomenon could be 
seen across different hospitals in the same health organization [20]. Given the 
similarity in the QC measures, we were able to train our AAS system with the STEMI 
set and validate it with the UA/NSTEMI set. The results in the patients with 
UA/NSTEMI also showed that the physicians did not prescribe -blockers as
rigorously as the guidelines suggested even after patients with potential
contraindications (hypotension, bradycardia, and bronchospasm) were removed. Little 
attention has been paid to lipid management in the high-risk patients (statin 
prescription to 26% patients with STEMI and 32% to those with UA/NSTEMI). In 
addition, cardiac surgeons prescribed aspirin, -blockers, ACE-I/ARB, and statin far 
less frequently than the internists. 
The methodology using textual reports as the information source has eliminated 
the need of complicated integration and database operation among different ancillary 
systems. More importantly, this approach has taken into account clinical conditions 
(e.g., shock, hypotension, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, azotemia, etc.) in which the 
doctors would consider not to use certain medications. The proportion in QC 
14
time during heart attack. On the other hand, the agreement rate was only substantial in 
the UA/NSTEMI set, in which a proportion of patients had been hospitalized for 
several times. When the “Present Illness” field did not record coronary angiography 
and intervention with a precise temporal relation, the AAS would encounter decision 
challenge about whether a procedure took place in the previous or in the current 
admission.
CONCLUSION
The results of this study demonstrate that an automated acquisition system 
equipped with novel information retrieval technology can be used to reliably extract 
QC measures for cardiovascular diseases efficiently. The applications can be 
generalized to evaluate the process and outcome of QC across the spectrum of CVD. 
Our study has provided a reliable tool and new perspective for determining the quality 
of care in all the hospitals across the country and around the world.
