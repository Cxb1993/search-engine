II. Introduction
Gas flowing through microchannels is a fundamental topic of great importance in the
fluid mechanics. The thriving development of various biochips enabled by MEMS
technology gives impetus to the researches focused on this interesting topic in the past
two decades. Study of gas flow in microchannels is not only of great importance to
the microfluidic devices but also may provide the understanding of how the toxic gas
flowing through the micro-cracks of chemical vessels.
The transport phenomena of gases flowing through microchannels are quite different
from those conventionally observed when the mean free path of the gas is commensurate
with the characteristic dimension of its confining structures. Gas rarefaction effect
becomes important when Knudsen number goes beyond 0.001. As a first sympton, no-
slip boundary conditions may break down due to the insufficient momentum exchange
between the gas molecules and its confining structures. Slip flows are even observed
when physicists were characterizing the transport properties of gases at a pressure of
one atmosphere [1]. The friction factor of the microchannel flow is reduced as slip flow
becomes prominant.
The large pressure drop per unit length through a long microchannel leads to the
significant variation in gas density along the microchannel. Thus compressibility be-
comes the pronounced effect for gas flow through microchannels.
Boundary conditions are particularly important in the prediction of rarefied gaseous
flows in microchannels. Although without a compelling argument and any microscopic
justification, it is well accepted that no slip boundary conditions do apply macroscopi-

reported by several experimental studies [10], [11]. Recently, Navier’s slip boundary
conditions have received the serious attention of researchers whose major interest is on
the physico-chemical nature of solid-liquid interface.
On the other hand, Maxwell (1879) treated the slip boundary conditions for the
case of gases rigorously [12]. Based upon the kinetic theory of gas, Maxwell proposed
that the tangential velocity vt of the gas on the wall to be calculated as follows:
vt =
2− f
f
Kn
∂v
∂y
∣∣∣∣
wall
,
where f is the tangential momentum accommendation coefficient or the fraction of
incident molecules that are reflected diffusively, Kn the local Knudsen number, v the
streamwise velocity, y is the normal coordinate directed toward the gas. A slip length
of the order of the mean free path of the gas molecules is expected. The case of f = 0 is
termed specular reflection, and this means no skin friction exists. The case of f = 1 is
called diffuse reflection, and the molecules are reflected with no net tangential velocity
macroscopically. As indicated by Sharipov [13], Maxwell assumed that the incident
molecules do not interact with the reflected ones in the Knudsen layer. Consequently,
the slip velocity calculated may not be accurate.
Though the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient can be determined
experimentally [14], [15], the physical nature of this coefficient is still not clear. In
particular, slip phenomenon depend crucially on the morphology and structure of the
surface which may differ from an experiment to the other drastically. In addition,
limitations in measurement accuracy at microscale tend to blur the conclusions that
may be drawn from the experiment.

sections of the microchannels are then characterized by a surface profiler (Dektak 6M,
Veeco). The averaged depth of the microchannel is 10.45µm. The inset in Figure 1
demonstrated the pillars formed in the channels using white light interferometry.

the pillars formed during the second stage ICP etching.
Two via holes (3 mm diameter) functioning as inlet and outlet ports are opened
on the Pyrex 7740 glass cover plate by ultrasonic machining developed and fabricated
in our laboratory. The silicon dies containing microchannels are then sealed with the
cover plates using anodic bonding (400◦C, 1100V, in air), also developed ans fabricated
in our own laboratory. In general, very good bonding (bonding strength > 20 MPa)
can be attained for a bonding time of 10 minutes [17]. To ensure perfect hermetic
sealing, all anodic bonding are conducted with a bonding time of 1 hour in this work.

them together with proper chemicals.
5. Test the hermetic sealing of the interconnect by holding pressure for 12 hours.
To measure the minute mass flowrate of the microchannel flows, the dual-tank mass
flow measurement system developed in [14], [16] is adopted and modified in this work.
The complete system is shown in Figure 4. Closeup of the dual-tank accumulation
system is shown in Figure 5.
For reliability and accuracy, all the test procedures are conducted sequentially by a
C program. Consequently, all the valves are pneumatically operated and controlled by
the solenoid valves. Pirani type pressure gauges based upon the thermal conductivity of
gas are gas-dependent and easily affected by the ambient thermal fluctuation. There-
fore, all direct total pressure measurements in this work are conducted with MKS
Baratron absolute capacitance pressure gauges. All the three MKS pressure gauges

tank and flow tank accurately?
In order to calculate the volumes of reference tank and flow tank very accurately,
a simple and reliable procedure was developed in this work. The volume of a tank
is first determined by filling distilled water into the tank and weighted on a precision
balance. Let the volume be Vt. This tank with know volume is then attached to the
system as shown in Figure 8. Pump down the pressure to a pressure pH close to the
upper limit (133 Pa) of the differential pressure sensor and isolate the tank with known
volume from the rest of the system. Pump down the pressure of the rest of the system
to a low pressure pL close to 0. Separate the flow tank and reference tank. After all
the pressures reach steady state, open the valve that separates the tank with known
volume and flow tank. Take the reading of the differential pressure sensor, ∆P . Then

Close the reference tank valve and let the system settle for 10 minutes. 4. Isolate the
two tanks by closing the isolation valve slowly. 5. Fill the system except the dual-tank
subsystem with gas till the desired inlet test pressure is reached. 6. Let the system
settle for 10 minutes before activating the microchannel flow (preflow measurement).
7. Open the chip valve to activate the microchannel flow till the differential pressure
sensor nearly reaches its full capacity (flow measurement). 8. Shut off the chip valve
and let the system settle for another 10 minutes (postflow measurement).
Ambient thermal fluctuations can be corrected for with the preflow-flow-postflow
signals. It is easy to make the correction for ambient thermal fluctuation with the
information of temperature histories. Consequently, this correction is made for all the
experimental data.
The low-density viscosities of helium, argon and nitrogen are obtained from [3] and
listed in Table 1.

V. Conclusions
A dual-tank mass flowrate measurement system with a resolution several orders of
magnitude higher than what is currently commercially available has been successfully
constructed. From the preliminary data, the experimental data for the case close to
the Poiseuille flow agrees well with theoretical data (within 10 %). We are currently
undertaking measurements of the mass flowrate of microchannels with artificial barriers
and the data will be submitted for publication soon.
VI. Self Evaluation
This project is very interesting but involves very delicate measurement in order to reach
affirmative conclusion in fundamental science. Under the limited budget, we are able
to build the anodic bonding system and ultrasonic machining system in our laboratory.
We don’t have sufficient funding for purchasing the necessary MKS baratron pressure
sensors that are critical for this work. Eventually, PI have to acquire these equipments
with personal funding. PI does believe this project will definitely run much well if the
funding is not too tight. In addition, PI believes very good data will be obtained and
published in the near future.
