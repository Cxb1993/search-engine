Abstract 
  In this research study, a control laboratory 
experiment, called the ball and wheel system, is 
introduced. The objective of this control system 
is to control the wheel such that the ball is 
balanced around its equilibrium position. This 
system is inherently nonlinear and unstable. 
The experimental setup of this system is very 
simple, easy to build, and suitable for the study 
of the nonlinear control system. One of salient 
features of this system is that it is feedback 
linearizable. Based on feedback linearization, a 
nonlinear controller is designed to achieve 
locally asymptotic stability of the system. The 
experimental results are given to demonstrate 
and validate the effectiveness of the control 
scheme. 
 
Keywords: Nonlinear control system; Full-
state feedback linearization. 
 
1.  Motivation and Objective 
 
  Over the past decades, a great number of 
control laboratory experimental setups, such as 
the inverted pendulum [1], [2], ball and beam 
[3], and inverted wedge [4], have been 
developed for control education and research. 
Many experimental setups provide challenging 
experiments and high-impact visual 
demonstrations that make them attractive to 
students. Moreover, because of inherent 
nonlinearity, instability and underactuation of 
many experimental setups, they often serve as 
testbeds for the research in nonlinear control 
systems. Feedback linearization [5]-[7] is an 
approach to nonlinear control design and has 
been an active research area since its 
development. The idea of this approach is to 
find a diffeomorphism and a state feedback 
control law that transform the nonlinear system 
into a linear time-invariant system. Then, the 
design is carried out on this new linear model 
using the well-established linear control design 
techniques. According to the availability of the 
measurement of system states, feedback 
linearization can be classified into full-state 
feedback linearization and input-output 
feedback linearization. Even though there are a 
number of successful applications of feedback 
linearization to the design of control systems 
for real-world problems [8]-[17], actual 
applications of full-state feedback linearization 
to the existing control laboratory experiments 
have been very few. So far, the electromagnetic

This system is linear and controllable. Then, a 
state feedback gain K  can be easily found 
such that the feedback control v Kx= -  
makes the closed-loop system stable. 
 
3.  System Modeling 
 
In this section, the mathematical model of 
the ball and wheel system is derived by using 
the Euler-Lagrange formulation [21]. The ball 
and wheel system is shown in Fig. 1. The 
parameters of the system are described in the 
following:

linearizability given in Theorem 1 are first 
examined. By computing ( )fad g x ,

is of interest to investigate the region of 
attraction of the closed-loop system under

denote

Let 0 1 2 3 4[ (0), (0), (0), (0)]
Tx x x x x=  be the

Denote 0 0( )T xx = , where the state 
transformation T is defined in (16)-(19). From 
the linear system (20)-(23) and the state 
feedback control law (24), since the closed-
loop system is exponentially stable, there exist 
positive constants a , b  and l  such that

where ×  stands for the Euclidean norm. The 
following proposition gives the sufficient 
condition of the region of attraction of the 
equilibrium point. 
  Proposition 1: Consider the polynomial 
 
6 4 2 4 2 6 3( ) 3 ,P z z z zr r a kb a= - - -    (31) 
 
where , , ,r k a  and b  are as defined before. 
Let minz be the minimum positive real root of 
P(z) and W  be as defined in (16). If the initial 
state 0x ÎW and 0 min( )T x z< , then the state 
 
( ) 0x t ®  as t ® ¥  
 
Proof: The objective here is to show that 
inequality (28) holds for 0x ÎW . Since ( )P z is 
a continuous function, (0) 0P > and ( ) 0P ¥ < , 
it gives that ( )P z  has at least one positive real 
root and ( ) 0P z >  for min[0, )z zÎ . Using (29)

7.  Concluding Remarks 
 
In this research study, the ball and wheel 
system was introduced. The mathematical 
model of the system was derived to facilitate 
the controller design. It has been shown that 
this system is locally full-state feedback 
linearizable. The stabilizing control law was 
then obtained based on the full-state feedback 
linearization. An estimate of the region of 
attraction was given. The experimental 
apparatus was constructed and the controller 
was implemented. Simulation and experimental 
results were presented to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the designed control system. A 
good agreement between the simulation and 
experimental results was also obtained. 
 
8. Self-evaluation of Significance 
   
  Many topics in control systems theory 
appear to be mathematically abstract. It is often 
difficult for student to visualize how control 
theory is related to practice. Direct 
implementation of theoretical control schemes 
in laboratory experiments should help students 
grasp abstract concepts. Significance of the 
results of this research is to introduce a control 
laboratory experimental setup that is full-state 
feedback linearizable. This experimental device 
is easy to build, in expensive, and well suited 
for nonlinear control study. The results of this 
research study has been published in the 
proceedings of the 45th IEEE conference on 
Decision and Control. The journal version of 
this study was submitted to IEEE Control 
Systems Magazine and it is currently under 
review.

決策暨控制研討會(Conference on Decision and Control，以下簡稱 CDC)
為 IEEE Control Systems Society的年會。IEEE Control Systems Society 創立
於 1954年，現有會員超過 10000人，其會員涵蓋全世界各大學、研究中心及
產業界從事控制工程理論與實務研究之學者專家，第 45 屆的 CDC 於 12 月
13日至 15日在美國的聖地牙哥舉行，為控制工程學界的一大盛事。 
今年共有 1081篇論文發表，每日分早上、中午、下午 3個時段，每個時
段約有 18個議程同時進行，3天會議下來共有 161個議程，所有論文以口頭
報告或海報的方式發表。會中並另外安排有 1場 Plenary Session、4場 Semi-
Plenary Sessions，主要是學術性論文的發表及專題演講，而主辦單位亦於會
議進行前舉辦一場歡迎會，簡單說明了此次會議的議程。 
本人於 12 月 12 日晚上向大會報到註冊。12 月 13 日大會正式揭幕，早

演講，他們精闢的演講內容勾勒出未來控制理論與實務應用的發展願景，也
增廣了本人的研究視野。 
此次會議中有將近 12個議程與非線性系統的控制、分析及穩定的相關論
文發表，由此可見，雖然針對非線性系統理論之相關研究已行之有年，但與
線性系統理論的完備性比起來，非線性系統理論仍有更多與更深入的發展空
間，而針對非線性系統的研究，國外有很多學者投入此研究領域中，並有相
當多的研究成果產出，此趨勢亦值得吾人針對非線性系統做更深入與更廣泛
的研究。此次會議除了傳統控制相關領域的議程外，大會亦安排有將控制理
論應用在飛行器、電力系統與微機電控制上的研究議程，而這些論文也對本
人未來研究的拓展有所助益。 
本次大會參與者超過千人，每日同一時段有 18個議程同時進行，規模雖
大，但議程皆已事先規劃完善，時間控制得宜，而能使會議圓滿落幕，其幕
後的大會人員的辛勞，令本人由衷的佩服。本次會議選在美國的聖地牙哥舉
行，聖地牙哥為美國前兩百大城市之ㄧ，此城市風景優美，交通便利，而會
場選在評價極佳的Manchester Grand Hyatt舉行，會場寬敞，旅館內即提供會
議、住宿、用餐之用，各項設施完備，堪稱為一流的會議場所。 
三、考察參觀活動（無是項活動者省略） 
四、建議 
大會為第一次參加 CDC 的學者、學生及隨行的家人舉辦歡迎會，讓他
們瞭解 CDC 的歷史淵源及會場環境。此次會議地點、會場環境、設施堪稱
一流。這些措施與相關設備為未來國內舉辦大型國際性會議時，非常值得借
鏡效法。 
CDC 每五年都會在美國以外的國家舉行，目前亞洲只有在日本主辦過
CDC，中國將於 2009 年承辦，本人深深感受到若國內控制學者先進能爭取
到 CDC 或其他大型國際性會議的主辦權，對於台灣邁向國際化將有莫大的
幫助。

Rn, and u e R is a scalar control signal. The derivative of
the smooth function h(x) along the vector field f(x) is
expressed by the Lie derivative
Lfh(x) = x
L'fh(x) stands for Lf(L$kj1h(x)) where L1fh(x)=Lfh(x)
and Ljfh(x) = h(x). The Lie bracket [f, g] is defined as
f ~ ~ ~ Ag d
[f, g](x) = f(x) - afg(ax ax
and
adfg(x) -[f, adf- gl(x)
where
adfg(x) = adfg(x) = [f , g](x)
adfg(x) = g(x).
If the nonlinear system (1) can be transformed into a linear
form by applying a state transformation and state feedback,
then controller design can be easily obtained based on this
linear form. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the
system feedback linearizability are given in the following
theorem.
Theorem 1 [5, 6, 7]: The nonlinear system (1) is feedback
linearizable, if and only if there exists a domainQ c R' such
that the following conditions hold:
(1) the matrix G(x) = [g(x), adfg(x) ,** ad)-lg(x)]
has rank n for all x E Q;
(2) the distribution
p = span{g(x), adfg(x) , ad)-2g(x)}
is involutive in Q .
Note that the above conditions are equivalent to the
existence of an output function h(x) for which the system
has relative degree n, i.e.,
Lgh(x) = 0
LgLfh(x) = 0
If the system (1) satisfies the above conditions, then there
exists a state transformation 5 = T(x) given by
h(x)
T(x) = Lfh(x)
LElh(x)
such that the system (1) can be transformed into the normal
form:
J1 = J2
J2 = J3

following state feedback control
u = I h() [-¾,h(x) + v]
the resulting system becomes
= A; + Bv
where
0 1 0 *-- 0 0
O 0 1 *--0 0
0
0 0 ... 0 1.
This system is linear and controllable. Then, a state feedback
gain K can be easily found such that the feedback control
v =
-Kj makes the closed-loop system stable.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
The ball and wheel system is shown in Fig 1. The
parameters of the system are described in the following:
rw : Radius of the wheel
rb : Radius of the ball
mb : Mass of the ball
I, : Moment of inertia of the wheel
L,Ln2h(x) = 0
LgLnflh(x) # O.

IV. STABILIZING CONTROLLER DESIGN VIA FULL-STATE
FEEDBACK LINEARIZATION
To derive a full-state feedback linearization control scheme,
the necessary and sufficient conditions for feedback
linearizability are examined for the ball and wheel system. By
computing adfg(x), ad'g(x), and adg(x), it gives that
-c
adfg(x) = -af
-f
-dfl
a]
ad 2g(= bc cos x + adf
f1gx) df
-cecosx1 +d2f_
-bccosx1 -a4
-bc(sin&-) x2
-afcosx=-acecosx--ad2f
-cecosxl-d2f
-ce(sinxl) *x2 -aefcosx1 -cd cos:x -df
From condition (1) of Theorem 1, by checking
det(G(x))
= det g(x) adfg(x) ad g(x) ad4g(x)]
= [C4e2 - 2Jbc3e + f2b2c2 ] (COS X )2
It gives that G(x) is full rank inQ, where
Q={(xI x2 x3 X4)- <xI <
It can be easily shown that
span {g(x) adfg(x) ad2g(x)} is also involutive in Q.
Thus, the system is full-state feedback linearizable in Q. To
find the change of variables that transforms the system
equations (7)-(10) into the normal form (2), it is necessary to
find the output h(x) satisfying
t Lgh(x) =O
LgLfh(x) = 0
LgL2fh(x) = 0
LgLfh(x) # 0.
A simple solution to above differential partial equations is
y = h(x) = fxl -cx3.
Then y y y(3) ,andy(4)are
y= Lfh(x) = fx2- CX4
= Lf2h(x) = (Jb - ce) sin x1
(3) = L3f h(x) = (fb - ce)x2cos x
y(4) = 4 h(x) + LgL h(x)
where
L4fh(x) =
-(Jb - ce)x22 sin x1 + (Jb - ce)(cos x1)
*(ax4 +bsinxl)
LgLfh(x) = c(Jb - ce) cos xl.
Note that LgL3fh(x) is nonzero in the region Q .
Then the new state variables are defined as follows:
,= h(x) = fxl - cx3
;2 =Lfh(x) = fx2 -cx4
3 =L2h(x) = (Jb-ce) sinx
;4 =L3h(x) = (Jb - ce)x2cosxI
This change of the variables transforms the system (7)-(10)
into the following normal form equations:
J1 = J2
42 = J3
J3 = J4
.4 =VL4h(x)+L Lgh(x)*u.
By choosing the feedback control
u = (x) [v -Lfh(x)]
it leads to the following linear system:
J1 = J2
42 = J3
43 = J4
= v
The new control variable v can then be taken as
v=
-Klj,- 2 2 - 3 3 - 4 4
