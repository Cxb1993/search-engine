1. Introduction 
    With increasing concern toward environmental protection, enterprises have 
become more and more responsible for their products to reduce pollution and damage 
in the world. One of the most important drivers of this phenomenon is the 
international regulations from the European Union (EU), the enforcement of Waste 
Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
(RoHS) and Eco-design Requirements for Energy using Products (EuP) have exerted 
pressures on industries worldwide to “think green” in every aspect of a company’s 
operations. 
    Another driver is the environmental consciousness from consumers who urge the 
company to enhance their ability of greening their product. Therefore, green supply 
chain management (GSCM) has emerged as a systematic and integrated solution for 
companies to maintain their sustainability and competitiveness in the market. Among 
issues of GSCM, green supplier selection is a crucial problem as a start to improve 
environmental performances since a good supplier helps to supply materials that 
comply with the regulations and furthermore assists in green design. 
    Taiwan manufacturers are now facing many challenges worldwide; they should 
contribute all effort to provide green product which conform to environmental 
regulations and meet the customers’ request. In the meanwhile, they have to compete 
with their competitors around the world. As a result, choosing a qualified supplier has 
become a matter of survival. 
    In this project, we will construct an effective decision support process for green 
supplier selection by adopting the integrated AHP/ANP approach and the ELECTRE 
III method. The integrated AHP/ANP approach is able to consider the 
interrelationships among criteria, and the ELECTRE III method is able to reflect the 
situations of incomparability and indifference. These methods are capable of 
containing both the quantitative and qualitative criteria in decision model. After that, 
we can compare the ranking results between the integrated AHP/ANP approach and 
the ELECTRE III method, and we attempt to provide a comprehensive procedure on 
green supplier selection issues. These methods also enable us to precede further 
analysis and to provide more knowledge about the evaluating result in order to make 
the decision process more reliable. 
 
2. Literature Review 
2.1 Criteria set 
    The collection of criteria includes across the field of traditional, partnership and 
green considerations for evaluating suppliers and they are the most representative in 
each field. The green criteria set are mainly adopted from Noci [6], who conduct an 
 3
2.3 ELECTRE III 
    ELECTRE III was proposed by Roy [7] which can analysis different criteria 
without converting them into a single scale. ELECTRE III was designed to deal with 
inaccurate, imprecise, uncertain or ill-determination of data, such as qualitative data. 
New ideas introduced by this method are the use of pseudo-criteria revealing the 
threshold concept, and fuzzy binary outranking relationship. ELECTRE III doesn’t 
only evaluate the best choice, and this should not be perceived as a structural 
deficiency of the method. Contrarily, it presents a specific ranking result and leaves 
the last selection judgment to the DMs. We firstly define the three threshold values 
involved in this method including indifference threshold, preference threshold and 
veto threshold. Indifference threshold is inserted to indicate a gap between the 
evaluations cores that are never the less still compatible with a situation of 
indifference. Preference threshold expresses the minimum difference between the 
values of some pair of criteria to which the DM attributes significance in terms of 
strict preference. Veto threshold expresses the minimum difference between the 
values of some pair of criteria beyond which the decision maker believes that the gap 
between the two scores cannot be compensated for by good performance of the other 
criteria. Once the set of alternatives and criteria are selected and the thresholds are 
evaluated by the DMs we can build up the concordance and discordance matrix. With 
the measure of concordance and discordance, the next step is to combine these two 
measures to produce a measure of the degree of the outranking which is called 
credibility index. The final step is to exploit the model and produce a ranking result 
from the credibility indexes. The general approach for exploitation is to construct two 
preorders by using the descending and ascending distillation process and then 
combine these two to produce a partial preorder. 
 
3. Green Criteria Framework of Green Supplier Selection 
    An integrated procedure of green supplier selection will be proposed in this 
section, focusing on only green related issues. We pair a supplier with its product that 
we needed as an alternative in the green supplier selection framework. This proposed 
procedure includes three phases which are thresholds, main criteria weighting with 
external factors, and sub-criteria weighting and evaluation. 
 
3.1 First phase 
    This phase collects the laws and directives on restricted substances in different 
countries, which will be treated as thresholds of supplier selection for preventing a 
supplier with certain unacceptable low performances in particular issues. The first 
phase can deleted the unqualified suppliers to reduce complexity in third phase. The 
 5
planning. The short term is defined by the reaction time, which is less than one year, 
referred from the ordinary rule of economics and accounting. We divide target market 
into European market and other markets since Europe plays an important role of 
benchmark in treaties, laws, and green concept. Green criteria cluster is the main part 
of this procedure of supplier selection, which connects the second phase and the third 
phase. The green criteria cluster considers three dimensions on green supplier 
selection, including management system, supplier’s image, and product performance. 
Summing up the three clusters and defined the relationship of interdependence, the 
relationship map in the second phase is shown in the mid-part of Fig. 1. 
Fig. 1 The overall framework of AHP/ANP 
3.2.1 Interdependence 
    Interdependence represents the influence between clusters, using arrows as the 
sign which also provide the direction of influence. Except the arrow from objective 
that means the pursuing of the goal, there are three arrows, which will be discussed in 
this paragraph, in the relationship map. The interdependences are green criteria to 
 7
supplier’s green image in another way, quantitative view. 
III. Green product performance 
    The sub-criteria components of green product performance are formulated based 
on the articles in first phase. Not only considering as the threshold but also seeking for 
the performance are the main concept of green product performance. Excluding the 
Yes/No articles, manufacturing process part includes only three components: 1. water 
emission, 2. air emission, 3. energy consumption. The evaluation of water emission 
considers the emission of PH, COD, BOD, SS, Cu2+, Pb2+, if it is possible, calculated 
as mean amount for each product. Just like water emission, air emission includes 
particulate pollutants, metal fume, SO2, NOx, HCl, Xylene. Finally, energy 
consumption is an additional element in third phase, considering the total energy use 
in manufacturing a single product. From the viewpoint of reversed logistics of the 
product, the level of recovery/recycle/reuse is the only sub-criterion in the framework. 
3.3.2 LCA introduced green criteria 
    By introducing an advanced concept, life cycle assessment, a new structure of 
green criteria formed. The two main activities in LCA are considered in the structure 
for a more general and quantitative evaluation. 
I. Green management system 
    Beside the original elements in normal green criteria cluster, the implementation 
of life cycle inventory are added in to the set of sub-criteria of green management 
system. LCI is the foundation of LCA, which has directive relationship with life cycle 
impact assessment, the other main activity in LCA. For evaluating the implementation 
of LCI, the completeness of data base of eco-profile is a practical viewpoint. We 
propose a list of check points to evaluate the performance on the implementation of 
LCI that are “Has implemented the LCI,” “Has Environmental Product Declaration or 
other evidence for the verification of data.” 
II. Supplier’s green image 
    A company’s LCA has a good performance does not directly affect the supplier’s 
green image since LCA is a new concept that are not mature enough to verify the 
performance with general acceptation of relevant industries. No additional element is 
suggested to join the main criterion of supplier’s green image in LCA introduced 
green criteria cluster. 
III. Green product performance 
    Instead of the original sub-criteria set in normal green criteria cluster, LCA 
introduced green criteria cluster uses a technique called life cycle impact assessment 
(LCIA) to evaluate the performance of the product attributed that LCIA is a 
cradle-to-grave method covering the whole life of a product.

4. Decision Framework 
4.1 Decision framework of AHP/ANP 
    As mentioned in Sec 2.1, the first phase is set to sift out qualified suppliers thus 
reducing the number of suppliers and decreasing the borden of evaluating suppliers in 
the fourth phase for ranking. The second and third phase is set to collect pairwise 
comparison data by distributing questionnaires so that we can calculate the weights of 
criteria and subcriteria respectively using ANP and AHP. This design is established to 
take the inherently interrelationship among criteria into account meanwhile not to 
make the comparison procedure too long to complete, assume the interrelationships 
among subcriteria causing by the relationships among criteria are minute and could be 
ignored without affecting the evaluation result. The fourth phase is composed of 
supplier evaluation and sensitivity analysis (SA). The former compute suppliers’ 
ranking regarding the current set of criteria/subcriteria weight; the latter adjust 
weights in this set to see whether this ranking is stable or not. Since the 
decision-making problems are usually decided by a group of experts, it is necessary to 
discuss how to synthesize the pairwise comparison values for a decision group. Saaty 
and Shang [9] advocate that geometric mean of each judgment values is the only 
appropriate way to stand for the group preference because of the reciprocity 
characteristic of the judgment matrix. We adopt their viewpoint to synthesize the 
opinion from consistent questionnaires and use Matlab to simulate a set of suppliers’ 
performances to demonstrate the decision procedure proposed by this study. 
    The mechanism of SA is written in Matlab for the convenience of matrix 
manipulation and its principle is narrated as follows. Alter one criterion/subcriterion at 
a time and suppose other criterion/subcriterion in the same cluster would adjust 
proportionally according to their original priorities so that the sum in the same cluster 
still remains to be 1. Afterwards a new ranking would come out with the new set of 
criterion/subcriterion weight. To graphically display how the ranking will change 
while one of the criterion/subcriterion weights is altered, several sets of the above 
mentioned new weight are demanded. Therefore, the chosen weight is set to be altered 
from 0.1, increase 0.1 at a time, to 0.9 to form a line. Other criterion/subcriterion in 
the same cluster will have a chance to increase or decrease their weight to form the 
new weighting set, depending on whether the chosen weight is decreasing or 
increasing. In the third hierarchy, except for the subcriterion—performance of 
environmental management system and the four subcriteria of green product 
performance, each of the rest six clusters has a function which is written for them to 
do this job. Nonetheless, each of the eight criteria in the second hierarchy has a 
function as those in the lower level. That is, both of the criterion/subcriterion 
hierarchy is tested and each criterion/subcriterion in the hierarchy is altered to see 
 13
to select the appropriate supplier(s). Therefore, when dealing with a large number of 
suppliers, we can present a preorder by ELECTRE III without considering the veto 
thresholds in the phase I procedure. Consequently, the complexity of calculation can 
be reduced and the numbers of parameters that need to be determined by the DMs are 
cut down. Accordingly, we can determine the efficient group and the further analysis 
will focus on them. After we obtain the final preorder in the phase I procedure, we 
take the top 50% suppliers as the efficient group. Then, we calculate final preorder 
again based on the efficient group including veto threshold. With the Phase II final 
preorder we can provide useful information to support the DMs. 
 
5. Illustrative Example 
5.1 Data collection 
    In order to demonstrate the selection framework, the following three kinds of 
data are needed to be collected: (1) the performance matrix which presents the 
suppliers’ performance under each criterion; (2) the weights for each criterion which 
represents the coefficients of importance of each criterion; and (3) the threshold that 
express the DMs’ feeling about realistic comparisons. In the demonstrated example, 
we evaluate 10 suppliers by considering 30 criteria, including 10 qualitative criteria 
evaluated by checkpoints respectively and 20 standards of the quantitative data. The 
weights for each criterion represent the coefficients of importance of each criterion. 
We use the integrated AHP/ANP approach and obtain the corresponding criteria 
weights as shown in Table 3. The criteria weight restrictions are collected by 
questionnaire procedures and the decision makers are composed of engineers, 
managers, and supervisors. There are six valid questionnaires out of 25, and the 
corresponding criteria weights are calculated by using the software Super Decision. 
    In order to compare the outcomes with the AHP/ANP approach, we use the same 
simulated data as the suppliers’ performance. This set of suppliers’ performances is 
generated by Matlab according to Tables 1 and 2. The former requires 0 or 1 for each 
checkpoint. Hence, a random function which generates uniform distribution numbers 
between 0 and 1 is used, and we set 1 for generated number above 0.5, otherwise 0. 
The latter demands for data produced within the regulation interval. We assume that 
the suppliers’ performances with regard to each quantitative subcriterion conform to 
normal distribution. The following setting also depicts the fact that most of suppliers 
would perform near the worst bound within the standards. A random function which 
generates numbers from standard normal distribution is utilized. The unknown 
average for each normal distribution is supposed to be 0.3 times of regulation 
intervals from the worst bound. For larger-the-better standards, the worst bound 
should be the lower one; otherwise it should be the larger one. The standard 
 15
    The last information we need to collect is the threshold values for each criterion, 
which includes the indifference, preference and veto threshold. We simulate the 
threshold values based on the relation which was proposed by Maystre et al. [5]. In 
our case we simulate the threshold values through the following process. For every 
criterion we simulate 21 suppliers’ performance values, and calculate the absolute 
difference for every pair of data, therefore there will be 210 values. We sort these 210 
data from the smallest to the largest, and take the value that locates around 1/3 (about 
the 70th data) as the value of q (indifference threshold), and the value that locates 
around 2/3 (about the 140th data) as the value of p (preference threshold). For the top 
50% importance criteria we set the veto threshold v twice of the value p, and for the 
rest of the criteria we adjust the value a little bit larger according to its significance. 
The simulated thresholds are shown in Table 3. 
 
5.2 Computational and comparison results 
    After we calculate the weights for each criterion, we can also use simple additive 
method to obtain the complete ranking result. Then, we want to compare the results 
between the AHP/ANP approach and the ELECTRE III method. From the previous 
studies, we can see that the AHP method provides output of the relative importance 
weightings of criteria and sub-factors. The AHP approach is the most prevalent one 
used among various integrated approaches for supplier selection because it can 
provide more and useful information for the decision makers [3]. We compile a brief 
summarize of the advantages and disadvantages of ELECTRE III method and AHP 
method in Table 4. The elements compared in Table 4 refer to Macharis et al. [4], 
which shows that a number of favorable characteristics of the AHP method could 
enhance ELECTRE III, namely at the level of the structuring of the decision problem 
and the determinations of weights, since with ELECTRE III, no guidelines are 
provided to determinate weights. 
   Based on the Two-Phase ELECTRE III method, we firstly obtain the preorder by 
concordance (credibility) matrix in the phase I procedure. The ranking result is shown 
in Fig. 3. After that, we take the result from the Phase I as a feedback to Phase II to 
find a more detailed evaluation. With this result we define the efficient group and go 
on to Phase II ranking procedure, and we consider the veto threshold set up by the 
DMs. In this example, we take the top 50% suppliers as the efficient group, therefore 
the efficient set are suppliers 1, 3, 4, 5 and 9. Different from Phase I procedure, this 
time we consider the veto threshold. Therefore, the next step is to calculate the 
discordance index. Differ from concordance, no aggregation over criteria take place. 
Therefore, for each criterion there is a complete set of discordance indices. The 
following step is to obtain credibility matrix by combining the concordance and 
 17
 
Fig. 3 Two-Phase ELECTRE III method – Phase I final preorder 
 
 
Fig. 4 Two-Phase ELECTRE III method – Phase II final preorder 
 
    We show that suppliers 3 and 9 are indifferent and ranked as the best suppliers, 
followed by suppliers 1 and 5 which are also incomparable and at last supplier 4. 
From the result, we can suggest the DMs that suppliers 3 and 9 perform well on 
different sides therefore incomparable. If the DMs needs to choice two suppliers, then 
suppliers 3 and 9 will be recommended. However, if only one supplier is needed, the 
DM can choice either suppliers 3 or 9 according to their preference. 
    We compare the result with the final preorder when using the original ELECTRE 
III method (veto thresholds considered) as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The relations between 
suppliers are the same between the two results. However, we can see that without 
sifting out the efficient group by the developed Two-Phase ELECTRE III method, the 
relations between the suppliers becomes too complicate since it contains more 
incomparable situations. With too many incomparable relations, it will confuse the 
DMs and make it even harder to make the final decision; therefore it can’t provide 
useful information. Hence, when the number of suppliers is large, it’s reasonable to 
introduce Two-Phase ELECTRE III method in order to reduce the complexity of 
calculation and simplify the final result to provide useful information to support the 
DMs. 
 19
comparing the results of Fig. 3 and Fig. 6 we have shown that the parameter set (0.2, 
0.15) is more distinguishable than the parameter set (0.3, 0.15) since the values in the 
credibility matrix are close. Based on the results we suggest the DMs to use (0.3, 0.15) 
as the initial parameter of the discrimination threshold according to the previous 
studies. However, if this set of parameter isn’t appropriate to distinguish the 
difference between alternatives, we should make an adjustment.

6. Conclusions 
    In this project, we proposed a green supplier selection procedure, which 
considers across the field of green, traditional, and partnership aspects in able to suite 
for real world applications. The proposed procedure is based on the ELECTRE III 
method which allows us to evaluate quantitative data and qualitative data together 
without converting them to a single scale. The ELECTRE III method introduces the 
concept of indifference, preference, and veto thresholds, to evaluate the performances 
between alternatives among different criteria. This method has a characteristic of 
non-compensatory, so a high degree of dissatisfaction regarding the performance of 
one alternative compared to another for one specific criterion may not necessarily be 
compensated for by good performance as regards the other remaining criteria. 
Therefore, it allows the situation of indifference or incomparable between alternatives, 
thus more suitable for the real world. The decision support procedure is suitable in 
multiple decisions makers and provides useful information regarding making a 
decision. After that, we compared the ranking results between the AHP/ANP
