英文摘要 
Accurate stress analysis of layered material systems that are sometimes very thin is of great 
importance in the assessment of their structural integrity and performance. To give satisfactory 
results, the discretised meshes of the conventional domain solution techniques, such as the finite 
element method, must have reasonable aspect ratios in the same order of unity. Therefore, the 
domain modeling of ultra-thin structures, such as the facings of sandwich composites and adhesive 
layers, shall require an enormous amount of discretised meshes that may incur overloading 
computations. Using the boundary element method as an alternative, the present work proposes an 
effective approach to analyze the interlaminar stresses of thin layered composites subjected to 
general thermal loads. The transformed boundary integral equation for anisotropic thermoelasticity 
is fully regularized using the technique of integration by parts and analytical integration. At the 
end, the veracity and applicability of the proposed scheme are demonstrated by numerical 
examples. 
 
Keywords: Boundary element method, thin anisotropic materials, thermoelastic interlaminar 
stresses 
 
Introduction 
 In recent years, multilayered composites have attracted substantial interests due to the 
multitude of benefits that they offer in practical engineering applications. In achieving this high 
performance, however, the interaction of the interfaces between constituent materials is of utmost 
importance. With proper simulation and analysis, effective design may diminish the possibility of 
layer delamination that leads to failure of composites. Since the through-thickness strength of 
composites, closely related to the delamination, is typically low as compared with their in-plane 
strength, the object of the present work is mainly focused on the interlaminar stresses in the 
through-thickness plane.

Cruse and Aithal [10] proposed a semi-analytical approach using Taylor series expansions for the 
kernels. Huang and Cruse [9] presented another approach taking a coordinate transformation to 
relax nearly singular kernels. Other approaches include Gaussian integration with fine subdivisions, 
kernel cancellation methods [11], the auxiliary surface of “tent'” method [12], and the line integral 
method [13]-[15].  There are too many to be mentioned herein for a thorough review. However, 
most works are mostly dealing with the nearly singular integrals for isotropic materials. Pertinent 
works in this regard for anisotropic materials still remain very scarce indeed.  Very recently, Wang 
and Sun [16] derived a non-singular boundary integral equation with the technique of integration 
by parts to analyze cracked anisotropic bodies. In this article, the scheme of integration by parts is 
applied to relax the weakly singular integral in the boundary integral equation of anisotropic 
elastostatics. For the traction kernel with strong singularity, the integral is analytically integrated to 
give exact formulation. Moreover, all other singular integrals associated with thermal effects are 
analytically integrated to give exact integration values. The algorithm has been successfully 
implemented in an existing BEM computer program to investigate the interlaminar thermoelastic 
stresses in thin multilayered composites. At the end, the effectiveness and applicability of the 
proposed scheme are demonstrated by numerical examples. 
 
Regularized BIE for 2D anisotropic heat conduction 
 For the problem of sequentially coupled thermoelasticity for anisotropic materials, the 
analysis involves not only elastostatics but also the problem of heat conduction in anisotropic 
media. As described in details by Shiah et al [17], the anisotropic field problem can be solved by a 
direct domain mapping scheme that adopts the isotropic fundamental solution. For solving the 
anisotropic thermal field by the mapping scheme, the coordinates of boundary nodes 1 2( , )x x  need 
to be transformed to 1 2ˆ ˆ( , )x x , given by

Also in Eqs. (20a) and (20b), Ajk are complex constants that are associated with the material’s 
properties. As already known, thermal effects shall lead to a domain integral in the associated BIE. 
Any attempt to directly evaluate this domain integral will involve domain discretisation that 
destroys the BEM’s notion as a truly boundary solution technique. As described in [8], the domain 
integral for the distorted boundary surface Sˆ  can be transformed into a series of boundary ones 
that gives the BIE

Similarily, the 4

  Another weakly integral needs to be treated is the 5
th

rearranged as follows, 
 12
In Eq. (41), mjδ  represents the Kronecker delta function defined as usual.  Although Eq. (40) is 
analytically exact, it is only considered a “semi-analytical” formulation since determination of Rjk 
for general elements of higher orders still needs to rely on a numerical root-finding scheme. 
Nevertheless, for quadratic elements (n=2) that are commonly used in the BEM analysis, the 
formulation is indeed analytically exact because the corresponding two roots can be analytically 
determined from its 2
nd
 order polynomial equation.  
 To this end, all nearly singular integrals of the BIE for anisotropic thermoelasticity have 
been fully regularized. However, there is one more issue needs to be addressed for the validity of 
the regularized BIE. As described in details by Shiah and Lin [8], the branch cut line of the multi-
value function log(z) needs be redefined to be oriented in the outward normal direction at the 
source point. The purpose of such a process is to avoid the intersection of the negative ξ axis 
through the domain, which will invalidate the volume integral transformation to yield the 
thermoelastic BIE due to the discontinuity of the kernel functions. To account for such argument 
redefinition, one needs to rewrite the logarithmic function in Eq. (35) to be

In Eq. (43), the branch cut of the first term on the right hand side is defined in the direction of the 
outward normal vector, while the others adopt the default setting in computers, which has the 
branch cut oriented in the negative ξ-axis.  To make compensation of this phase difference, the 
integration of Eq. (36) for ten-point Gauss integration, for example, is thus rewritten as

PLANE77 for thermal conduction analysis). Table 3 shows the uniformly distributed stresses 11σ  
along interfaces obtained by the un-regularized BIE (UBIE), the regularized BIE (RBIE), and 
ANSYS. From the comparison, it is seen that the results of RBIE with relatively coarse meshes 
agree pretty well with those obtained by ANSYS, while the UBIE fails to yield satisfactory results. 
All other stress components 12σ  and 22σ , which are not shown herein, are negligible as compared 
with 11σ .

 As shown in Fig. 4, the left and right surfaces, fully constrained from motion in any direction, are 
subjected to a temperature change of 0
0
C and 100
0
C, respectively, while the other surfaces are 
thermally insulated. As shown in Fig. 5, taking advantage of symmetry, the mesh discretisation

element of integration. Using coarse meshes, the proposed BEM approach can be applied to model 
ultra-thin layers of composites, while a tremendous amount of fine meshes are required for the 
modeling of the conventional finite element analysis.
