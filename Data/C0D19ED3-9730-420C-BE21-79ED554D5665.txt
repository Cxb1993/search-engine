WMSNs. Although the node importance of WMSNs plays a major role in cooperative 
caching, the characteristic of multimedia item is another essential issue in cache 
replacement that should be carefully treated. However, only taking the characteristic of 
multimedia item, such as data size and the timestamp of the latest access into consideration 
for cache replacement is insufficient. For instance, if a multimedia item is temporally 
requested by some sensor nodes, it may suffer from a frequent replacement due to the large 
data size.  
In this paper, we propose a concept named temporal region requesting pattern (TRRP), 
and an algorithm named TRRP-Mine for mining TRRPs efficiently. By utilizing the 
discovered TRRPs, we also designed a temporal region requesting cost function (TRRC) of 
the candidate cache victim to assist the cache replacement in reducing replacements and 
increasing hit rate. Through empirical evaluations, we observe that TRRC applied to the 
cache replacement mechanism works efficiently in terms of hit rate and the number of item 
replacements. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Preliminaries are stated in 
Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the problem definition, proposed pattern, mining 
algorithm, and cost function of the candidate cache victim. Some simulation results are 
made in Section 4. A conclusion is given in Section 5. 
2. Preliminaries. In the past decades, a lot of studies have probed into the caching 
techniques on many applications such as databases [12], web applications, and wireless 
networks. Existing research in caching on Web can be divided into two main architectures: 
1) cooperative and 2) non-cooperative [14]. Besides, there are a great number of caching 
approaches for wireless cellular network [11]. Some cooperative caching protocols have 
been proposed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) [2], [4], [16]. By utilizing 
geographical proximity or well-known clustering algorithms, a region concept has been 
employed for the cooperative caching approaches [2], [4], [16]. In [17], the authors took 
both data and node locality into considerations and proposed three approaches, which were 
CacheData, CachePath, and HybridCache respectively. However, the aforementioned 
caching techniques do not suit WMSNs due to the severe resource constraints like memory 
space and energy consumption.  
Most of existing studies on caching technique of wireless sensor networks focus on the 
placement of caches [15]. In [5], nevertheless, Dimokas et al first proposed an approach of 
cooperative caching in WMSNs. A node importance-based cooperative caching (NICoCa) 
in [5] creates a precedent of cooperative caching on WMSNs. The plain assumption of 
NICoCa is that each sensor node has a moderate local storage capacity associated with it, 
i.e., a flash memory. NICoCa exploits the importance of sensors relative to the network 
topology in terms of their position in the network and/or residual energy. A concept of 
mediator node [5], which plays a significant part of position in the network, is proposed to 
aid cooperative caching. Integrating the sensor’s position and residual energy into the 
caching strategy facilitates the prolongation of network lifetime and short latency in 
multimedia data retrieval.  
  
 
 
Time-to-Live, and the number of the item requested by the sensor node.  
The concept of LRU and the number of the item requested by the sensor node may be 
insufficient to reflect the requesting information such as items are temporally requested by 
some sensor nodes. Considering the requesting information, a temporal region requesting 
pattern (TRRP) is proposed in our work. A TRRP represents that the multimedia item is 
temporally requested by a sensor region and reveals the relation between the items’ 
requesting information and the sensor node. In next section, the problem definition, the 
definition of TRRP, mining methodology, and proposed cost function are described. 
3. Problem Definition and Mining Approach. In this section, we first state our network 
environments, the problem, and the definition of TRRP. Afterwards, we explain our 
proposed method, temporal region requesting pattern mining, abbreviated as TRRP-Mine. 
The temporal region requesting cost function (TRRC) of the candidate cache victim is 
proposed in the final subsection. 
3.1 Network Environment and Problem Statement. In our work, we adopt the network 
model as proposed in NICoCa. In this model, it is assumed that the elemental source of 
multimedia data is a Data Center and sensor nodes are capable of caching the datum which 
have requested. In addition, it is supposed that each sensor node is aware of its 2-hop 
neighborhood. An ordinary sensor routing protocol accompanies the sending of requests. 
Each sensor node stores the related metadata of a cached multimedia item (datum) [5]. A 
request item is in the form as (dataID, timestamp) and represents that a sensor node 
launches a request for a multimedia item, dataID, at the timestamp. A request transaction 
consists of a series of request items. Therefore, a request transaction table from NICoCa 
recording the request logs of each sensor node [5] can be obtained as Table 1 shown.   
Without loss of generality, some multimedia items are requested temporally by some 
nodes which are 2-hop neighbors of each other. For the existing cache replacement for 
WMSNs, a multimedia item whether is purged from the sensor node hosting it mainly 
depends on the size of the multimedia item and the last access timestamp. However, some 
multimedia items, whose size is large, are temporally requested by the mediator nodes 
locating a specific region. Such multimedia items may suffer from a frequent replacement.  
To solve the above problem, one of our purposes is to discover temporal region requesting 
patterns. A temporal region requesting pattern represents that the multimedia item is 
temporally requested by the sensor nodes locating a 2-hop region. In our work, we named 
the temporal region requesting patterns as TRRPs. A mining problem of TRRPs is 
explained in next subsection.

The concept of FDR is evolved from the Belady’s algorithm. If the time gap between two 
successive time stamps of R requested by S is larger, it implies that R would have a lower 
probability of being requested by S in the near future.     
Hence, the mining problem is defined as follows. Given a request transaction database, 
DRT, containing the request transactions of sensor nodes, two specific thresholds, namely 
temporal window size w, and purity threshold, ε, the problem is to discover the temporal 
region requesting patterns (TRRPs). Based on the above definitions, a mining algorithm of 
TRRPs is proposed in next subsection. 
3.3 TRRP-Mine Methodology. Our method is named Temporal Region Requesting Pattern 
Mining (TRRP-Mine). The algorithm is illustrated with Figure 3. First, all the sensors are 
clustered into the 2-hop region set (line 1). Then, the each 2-hop region is retrieved from 
the 2-hop region set one by one (line 2 and line 3). The time sequence table of the 2-hop 
region requesting all multimedia items is initialed (line4). The time sequence of each sensor 
node in the 2-hop region requesting all items is added to time sequence table (from line 5 to 
line 8). Afterwards, the time sequence of each multimedia item requested by the 2-hop 
region is retrieved from the time sequence table and taken as an input for temporal pattern 
mining, abbreviated as TP-Mine. Considering the computation ability of sensor node, 
TP-Mine only requires one scanning of the time sequence to discover the temporal pattern. 
In Figure 4, the inputs of TP-Mine are the requesting time sequence of the multimedia item, 
A, the 2-hop region, NH, time window threshold, δ, and purity threshold, ε.  
  
 
 
the future is employed (from line 6 to line 19). Afterwards, based on the given parameters, 
the purity of δ-temporal continuity of TS(NH,A) is checked whether A is a TRRP of NH or 
not (from line 20 to line 32).The temporal reference rate of A requested by the sensor node 
in NH is calculated based on Eq.4. The spirit of TRRP-Mine is two-folded, 1) discover the 
temporal region requesting pattern, and 2) derive the temporal reference rate and the future 
discarding rate of each multimedia item requested by each sensor node. In the next 
subsection, a novel cost function of the candidate cache victim integrating the temporal 
reference rate and future discarding rate for cache replacement is proposed.   
3.4 Cost Function of Cache Replacement. In this subsection, we describe our proposed 
cost function of the candidate cache victim, namely Temporal Region Requesting Cost 
Function, abbreviated as TRRC. Different from the existing cache algorithm, such as MRU, 
LRU, and the cache replacement policy of NICoCa, TRRC employs the concepts of 
temporal reference and future discarding rate. Given a multimedia item, R, and a sensor 
node, N, the formula of TRRC is listed as follows:

( , )= ( , ) (1 ( , ))
( ) ( , )
DataSizeOf R
TRRC R N FDR N R TR N R
TTLOf R num N R
            (6). 
The candidate cache victim of the cached items is the one with largest cost calculated by 
TRRC. In Eq.6, the num(N,R) denotes the number of R requested by N; the FDR(N,R) 
represents the future discarding rate of R requested by N; the TR(N,R) means the temporal 
reference rate of N requesting R. Through TRRP-Mine, if R was requested rarely by N and 
the time gap between two successive requesting stamps of N requesting R was too large, the 
FDR(N,R) was magnified. In this way, the probability of that R was chosen as a candidate 
cache victim of N increases correspondingly. On the contrast, if R was a TRRP of a sensor 
region containing N, then the TR(N,R) was bigger than the other cached items of N and the 
TRRC(R,N) was smaller than the other cached items. Therefore, as the FDR(N,R) was 
bigger than the other cached items and TR(N,R) was smaller than those ones, it implied that 
the probability of that R would be requested by N in the future was smaller than the other 
items. Taking both the characteristics of multimedia item and requesting information of the 
item cached by the sensor node into consideration, TRRC can exploit the cache 
replacement based on the requested probability built by temporal requesting information. In 
the next section, a number of experiments were conducted to show the performance of 
TRRC. 
4. Experimental Results. In this section, we state the descriptions of the data set generated 
by our proposed simulator and the metrics of our evaluations. Then, a number of 
experiments are conducted through comparisons with different cache algorithms.  
4.1 Experimental Settings and Metrics. All experiments were conducted on a P4-2.0 G 
Hz machine with 1 GB main memory. The proposed approach and data generator were 
implemented by using JAVA. We referred to the simulation model [5], and defined the 
primary parameters for the simulation model listed in Table 2. We collected the requesting 
log of three days for mining TRRP and took the requesting log of one day as the testing 
data sets.  
The most popular metrics of cache algorithm are hit rate and number of replacement. 
The hit rate is defined as: 
  
 
 
60 time units and purity threshold is set as 0.5, TRRC could have higher hit rate and fewer 
replacements. For the simplicity, therefore, the parameter settings of TRRP-Mine in the 
four major experiments are to set temporal window size as 60 time units and purity 
threshold as 0.5. 
Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) show that the results of varying the number of multimedia 
item. In Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b), we observe that the hit rate of the five methods 
decrease and the number of replacement of them increase as the increase in the number of 
multimedia item. This is because the number of LH, PH, and RH decrease with the increase 
in the number of multimedia item which the sensor node chooses to issue. In terms of hit 
rate and replacements, TRRC is the most near-optimal method. In addition, the hit rate of 
TRRC outperforms NICoCa by 7 % and the number of replacements of TRRC is smaller 
than NICoCa by 20%. Among the five methods, LRU and MRU only take the requesting 
timestamp to calculate the cost of the candidate cache victim. This is the reason that both 
LRU and MRU have an obviously lower hit rate and more replacements than the others.  
The results of varying the memory size of cache are shown as Figure 6(a) and Figure 
6(b). With the extension of the memory, the number of multimedia item held by the cache

predicted requests in the future (defaulted as 70) is large, all the cached items might occur 
in the predicted requests. In this way, the replacement mechanism must calculate the cost of 
all the cached items to decide the candidate cache victim. Nevertheless, the cached item 
with the largest cost may be the one requested in the next K requests, where K is smaller 
than 70. 
The experiments of adjusting the event probability are shown as Figure 8(a) and Figure 
8(b). A higher event probability represents that the sensor node more probably issues the 
requests which have been issued in the past. Therefore, with the increase in the event 
probability, the hit rate of the five methods has a gradual raise. In the meanwhile, the 
number of replacements of the five methods has relatively lessened. The cost functions of 
NICoCa, Belady’s Algorithm+NICoCa, and TRRC consider the occurrence of the 
requested items as well. As the event probability increases, therefore, the gap of the hit rate 
between the LRU and NICoCa enlarges. 
Overall speaking, in terms of hit rate, TRRC outperforms LRU, MRU, and NICoCa by 
7% at least. In addition, the replacements of TRRC are fewer than LRU, MRU and NICoCa 
by 25%.    
5. Conclusions. This paper proposed a novel concept named temporal region requesting 
pattern (TRRP) and a one-scanning mining approach, namely TRRP-Mine, to discover the 
TRRPs. In addition, by utilizing the discovered TRRPs, a pattern-based cost function, 
named as Temporal Region Requesting Cost Function (TRRC), is designed for cache 
replacement of WMSNs. In TRRC, two novel factors, namely temporal reference rate and 
future discarding rate, are proposed to calculate the score of candidate cache victim based 
on the requested probability built by temporal requesting information. To our best 
knowledge, this is the first work applying the pattern-based cost function to explore cache 
replacement of WMSNs. In the simulations, we compare TRRC with some well-known 
cache algorithms such as LRU, MRU, NICoCa, and Belady’s Algorithm+NICoCa in terms 
of hit rate and the number of replacement. In the meantime, the performance is evaluated 
by adjusting four key parameters, which are ItemNum, CacheSize, AvgItemSize, and 
AvgEventProb respectively. Through empirical evaluations of different parameter settings, 
the hit rate of TRRC is higher than the other methods by 7% and the replacements of 
TRRC are fewer than the others by 25% at least. This result indicates that TRRC achieves 
efficiently not only the prolongation of network lifetime but also the short latency in 
multimedia data retrieval.
