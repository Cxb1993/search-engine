The laser noise has been well studied theoretically and experimentally.  Most of the 
experimental works were concerned about the standard deviation of the noise, with the implicit 
assumption that the noise distribution is Gaussian, which disagrees with other publications 
where the distribution is studied.  We employ a new approach to measure the semiconductor 
laser noise distribution down to a 10-11 BER with a measurement time of less than an hour.  
This method takes advantage of the high sampling rate of BER testers (BERT) available today.  
We found that the noise distribution for a 1310nm Fabry-Perot semiconductor laser and a 
1550nm DFB semiconductor laser are well fitted by Gaussian distributions. 
 
The results have been sent and accepted for publication in IEEE Photonics Technology Letters.  
The paper title is “Intensity Noise Distribution of Semiconductor Lasers Measured Using Bit 
Error Rate Testers”.

To calibrate for the noise of the test equipments, the noise standard deviation from the OE 
converter output with the laser turned off is measured by the scope and found be to 0.56mV.  
Since the laser noise (at 0.5mW) measured on the scope (see below) is about 6mV, the noise due 
to the O/E converter and the scope is negligible.  It will also be shown below that the BERT 
measured noise standard deviation with 0.5mW laser power is consistent with that measured 
with the scope.  Thus the BERT noise is also negligible. 
 
Our approach of using the BERT to measure the laser noise is as follows.  The laser power 
fluctuates about its average.  It is the distribution of this fluctuation that we want to quantify 
and that is what is what contributes to the BER in an optical communication system.  If we 
vary the BERT 1/0 threshold setting and measure BER, we are effectively measuring the noise 
distribution.  Three different signal patterns can be used for this purpose, a pseudo random bit 
stream (PRBS), a “1010” periodic pattern, or a continuous wave (CW) pattern.  With the 
former two, the BERT should sample at the bit center for the noise distribution.  Since the laser 
has a finite bandwidth, a PRBS optical pattern has a deterministic jitter (DJ) causing every bit to 
have a different height.  The measured distribution will then be the sum of the DJ and the laser 
intensity noise, an undesirable situation.  With a “1010” periodic pattern, DJ is not present.  
However, there is still random jitter from the electronics and the laser random turn-on delay, 
which confound the laser noise.  We thus adopt the CW pattern, where the measured noise 
comes purely from the laser.  With this setup, since the intensity is from the sum of all modes.  
the mode partition noise is not manifested here. 
 
If the laser intensity distribution is f(x), then the probability, PL(x), that a sampled intensity is 
below x is given by .  Similarly the probability, P∫ ∞−= xL duufxP )()( H(x), that a sampled 
intensity is above x is .  With the laser running CW, we inform the BERT 
that the data pattern is “1111” when we sample the noise distribution below the average to find 
P
∫∞= xH duufxP )()(
L(x), and “0000” ” when we sample the noise distribution above the average to find PH(x).

III. Results and discussion 
Early in the experiment, we observed an unusually large instability in the measured BER when 
the test condition is fixed.  Figure 2 shows the BER versus time.  Each data point corresponds 
to the BER averaged over a 0.1 second interval.  In Fig.2(b) the laser pigtail output was

In each figure, the data points are fitted separately above and below the average power point 
with an error function which would result from a Gaussian intensity distribution.  Though the 
Gaussian fits the experimental data well, the standard deviation, σ, above and below the average 
differ slightly.  With the FP laser, σ is larger below the average, while the DFB trend is 
opposite.  Since the same DFB laser measured with the Emcore BERT skewed in the same 
direction as the FP, the difference observed here cannot be attributed to the lasers.  To find the 
cause, the DFB intensity histogram at 0.5mW is taken with the sampling scope.  The histogram 
in Fig. 4 clearly is symmetrical.  Since the voltage scale of the scope is expected to be much 
more accurate than that of the BERTs, we conclude that both noise distributions are symmetrical 
and the observed difference is due to the scaling uncertainty above and below the 0 mV in
