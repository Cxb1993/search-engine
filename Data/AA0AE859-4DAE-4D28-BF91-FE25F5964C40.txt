Recently, a closed-form gate tunneling current model for the
MOS device using a quantum approach [9] has been reported. In
order to simplify the analysis, here, the local gate tunneling current
density ðJGðyÞ), which is a function of the vertical electric ﬁeld in
the gate oxide or the difference in the voltage between the gate
and a position y at location y in the lateral channel ðVG  VðyÞ),
has been approximated as [10]:

Author's personal copy
shown in the ﬁgure, as veriﬁed by the experimentally measured
data, the partitioned gate tunneling current model provides an
accurate prediction of IG in both the triode and the saturation re-
gions. Without the partitioned gate tunneling current model,
IG; ISL, and IDL could not be modeled. As shown in ﬁgures, when
VD increases, IG; ISL and IDL decrease for both cases with the chan-
nel length of 10 lm and 0:24 lm. At VD ¼ 0 V; ISL is equal to IDL
since the channel potential is uniform, thus the gate tunneling cur-
rent distribution is also uniform. When VD increases, ISL becomes
larger than IDL, which implies that the dominance of the local gate
tunneling current near the source over that near the drain. This
trend continues until the device enters the saturation region. As
shown in Fig. 3a, when VD becomes larger further, IG; ISL and IDL le-
vel off. A further increase in VDS does not change them noticeably.
This is due to the dominance of the local gate tunneling current in
the pre-saturation region near the source as compared to the post-
saturation region in the channel near the drain. As shown in Fig. 3b,
with a shorter channel length of 0:24 lm, for case with the device
biased in the saturation at VG ¼ 0:5 V, when VD increases over
1.05 V, ISL and IDL decrease again. This is because of the more
importance of Segment c, where the direction of the gate tunneling
current is opposite to that in Segment a.
Fig. 4 shows the drain and the source currents versus the drain
voltage of the NMOS device with a 1 nm gate oxide, a channel
width of 10 lm and a channel length of 10 lm and 0:24 lm biased
at (a) VG ¼ 1:5 V and (b) VG ¼ 0:5 V, based on the partitioned gate
tunneling current models considering the distributed effect and
the experimentally data. As shown in the ﬁgure, the model results
of the IS and the ID curves for the 10 lm and 0:24 lm, match well
with the experimentally measured data. For the case with the
channel length of 10 lm, without considering the tunneling cur-
rent (dashed lines), the model results of the IS and the ID curves
are quite deviating from the measured data. On the other hand,
for the case with the channel length of 0:24 lm, regardless of con-
sidering the gate tunneling current or not, no difference exists be-
tween the model result and the data. This could be explained as
follows. For the case with the channel length of 10 lm, the differ-
ence between the ID=IS and the IG curves is smaller as compared to
the 0:24 lm case. Thus, the effect of the tunneling current on IS=ID
is noticeable. In addition, with a channel length of 10 lm, the dis-
tributed effect in the channel region in the saturation region of the
channel is much more important as compared to the 0:24 lm case.
Fig. 5 shows the total gate current versus VD of the NMOS device
with a 1 nm gate oxide, a channel width of 10 lm, and with a chan-
nel length of 10 lm and 0:24 lm, biased at VG ¼ 0:3 V, 0.5 V and
0.7 V, based on the partitioned gate tunneling model considering
the distributed effect and the experimentally measured data. As
shown in the ﬁgure, at VG ¼ 0:7, there is a rapid decrease in IG
when VD increases initially from VD ¼ 0 V , as compared to other
cases. This implies the dominance of the local tunneling current
in the pre-saturation region of the channel. After the initial de-
crease near VD ¼ 0 V, the gate current of all cases stays relatively
constant. For the short-channel case with the 0:24 lm channel
length, at VG ¼ 0:3 V, when VD is greater than 0.9 V, IG becomes
negative, which indicates that the local gate tunneling current with
the opposite direction in Segment c of the post-saturation region
becomes dominant as compared to that in the pre-saturation re-
gion of the channel (Segment a). As shown in the ﬁgure, the parti-
tioned gate tunneling current model considering the distributed
gate tunneling current could predict the total gate current for both
the long-channel and the short-channel cases biased in triode or
saturation accurately, as veriﬁed by the experimentally measured
data. For the long-channel case, the gate tunneling current in the
pre-saturation region in channel (Segment a) dominates. For the
short-channel case, while biased in the saturation region, the gate
tunneling current in the post-saturation region near the drain

Abstract-This paper reports the role of the parasitic 
bipolar device in the 40nm PD SOI NMOS device with 
the floating body effect. Using a unique extraction 
method, the function of the parasitic bipolar device 
during  transient operations could be modeled. 
During the turn-on transient by imposing a step 
voltage from 0V to 2V at the gate, the case with a 
slower rise time shows a faster turn-on in the drain 
current due to a stronger function of the parasitic 
bipolar device from smaller displacement currents 
through the gate oxide, as reflected in the current 
gain, as verified by the experimentally measured 
results. 
I. Introduction 
Floating body effect of PD SOI CMOS devices have 
been studied intensively in the past [1][2]. The parasitic 
bipolar device in the PD device, which could cause the 
Kink effect, is difficult to model [3][4]. In fact, the parasitic 
bipolar device is important for the behavior of the PD SOI 
CMOS devices. In this paper, using a unique extraction 
method, the function of the parasitic bipolar device during 
DC and transient operations could be modeled. In the 
following section, the test device is described first, 
followed by the DC and the transient operations and 
discussion.

Fig. 1 shows the TEM cross section in the channel 
length direction of the 40nm PD SOI NMOS device under 
study [3]. The test device has a 70nm thin film doped with 
a p-type doping density of 3x1018cm-3 above a buried 
oxide of 145nm and a gate oxide of 1.5nm. A 65nm LDD 
region doped with an n-type density of 1019cm-3 under a 
sidewall spacer has been used. A nickel polycide is 
formed on the top of the gate and a SiN capping layer is 
deposited over the device.  The effective channel length 
of the device is 40nm. Experimental measurement of the 
test device and 2D device simulation have been used to 
carry out the study. 
III. Transient Operation

gate based on experimentally measured data and the 2D 
simulation . 
The behavior of the parasitic bipolar device during the 
transient of the PD SOI NMOS may be quite different 
from that operating at DC. Fig. 2 shows the drain current 
of the PD device during the turn-on transient by imposing 
a step voltage from 0V to 2V at the gate of the test device 
based on the experimentally measured  data  and  2D  
simulation result for the cases with the rise times of 10ns 
and 100ns. As shown in the figure, with a rise time of 
10ns for the gate voltage, the drain current could not 
reach its peak value at the end of the gate voltage ramp 
while with a rise time of 100ns, it almost reaches it. The 
different slew rates of the drain current curves during the 
ramp up transients between the cases with different rise 
times may have some implications.

Floating-Body-Effect-Related Gate Tunneling Leakage Current Phenomenon of 40nm PD SOI 
NMOS Device

Due to the buried oxide structure, SOI MOS devices may suffer from floating-body related kink 
effects [1]. For nanometer MOS devices with a thin gate oxide, gate tunneling leakage current cannot 
be neglected [2]. In this paper, analysis of the floating-body-effect-related gate tunneling leakage 
current phenomenon of the 40nm PD NMOS device using the SPICE bipolar/MOS equivalent circuit 
approach is reported. Fig. 1 shows the cross section of the 40nm PD SOI NMOS device under study. 
As shown in the figure, a thin film of 70nm is above a buried oxide of 145nm. The effective channel 
length is 40nm and the gate oxide thickness is 1.5nm. Experimental measurement and an equivalent 
circuit approach based on the SPICE bipolar/MOS device models have been used to conduct the study.  
As shown in Fig. 2, the PD SOI NMOS device could be characterized using the combination of an 
MOS device with a bipolar device, which is used to account for the function of the parasitic BJT in the 
thin film. Using the SPICE bipolar/MOS equivalent circuit approach, considering the current 
conduction mechanism [3], the drain current of the PD SOI NMOS device is composed of the surface 
channel current (Ich), the hole current (Ih) generated by the impact ionization (II) in the high electric 
field region and the collector of the parasitic bipolar device (IC). The base current (Ib) of the parasitic 
BJT comes from a portion of the II current (kIh). The source current (IS) is composed of the channel 
current (Ich), the remaining portion of the II current ((1-k)Ih) and the emitter current (IE) of the parasitic 
bipolar device. A portion of the collector current (k’IC) goes to the high electric field region, also 
triggering II. The distributed gate tunneling leakage current is a function of the local vertical electric 
field in the gate oxide. From the partitioned model [2], the lumped gate-source/drain tunneling leakage 
current (IGS/IGD) could be found. Total gate tunneling leakage current is the sum of the lumped gate-
source/drain components- IG=IGS+IGD. Using the equivalent circuit based on the SPICE bipolar/MOS 
devices, the floating-body-effect-related gate tunneling leakage current could be analyzed assuming 
the existing models of the bipolar and the MOS devices. Fig. 3 shows the gate current versus the drain 
voltage of the 40nm PD SOI NMOS device based on the experimentally measured data and the SPICE 
bipolar/MOS equivalent circuit approach with and without considering the bipolar device. As shown in 
the figure, when the drain voltage increases, the gate tunneling leakage current decreases. When the 
gate voltage decreases, the gate tunneling leakage current also decreases. As the gate voltage becomes 
small, the gate tunneling leakage current becomes very small, possibly negative, at a large drain 
voltage. Using the SPICE bipolar/MOS equivalent circuit approach considering the bipolar device, the 
gate tunneling leakage current (IG) behavior especially at a large drain voltage could be predicted. 
Without considering the bipolar device, IG is over-estimated at a large VD. The trend on the gate 
tunneling leakage current as shown in Fig. 3 is closely correlated to the kink behavior [4], which is 
also due to the floating body effect of the PD SOI NMOS device. Fig. 4 shows (a) the base voltage 
(Vbe) of the parasitic bipolar device and (b) the drain current versus the drain voltage of the 40nm PD 
SOI NMOS device, extracted from the SPICE simulation results using the SPICE bipolar/MOS 
equivalent circuit approach. As shown in the figure, at a larger VG, the base voltage rises later, which 
indicates a slower turn-on of the bipolar device, confirming the trend as the result by 2D device 
simulation [4]. At a larger VG, the high electric field region in the lateral channel direction at the front 
Si/SiO2 interface shrinks. Thus, a reduced II leads to a weaker function of the parasitic bipolar device. 
On the other hand, as indicated in the figure, a smaller VG such as 0.4V brings in an earlier turn-on of 
the parasitic bipolar device due to a stronger II, which also affects the gate tunneling leakage current as 
the floating body effect. Fig. 5 shows the perpendicular electric field at the interface along the path 
around the three U-shaped edges of the poly gate of the 40nm PD SOI NMOS device, biased at 
VG=0.4V and VD=0.2V/1.2V, based on the 2D simulation results. As shown in the figure, when VD is 
large (1.2V), in the path close to the drain, the electric field is substantially reduced, possibly 
becoming negative. As a result, the corresponding local gate tunneling leakage current reverses its 
direction in this region- IG reduces substantially at a large VD. More insight into the mechanism of the 
gate tunneling leakage current could be obtained by studying the partitioned gate tunneling leakage 
current components. Lumped gate-source/gate-drain tunneling leakage currents IGS/IGD, which could be 
obtained by partitioning the distributed gate tunneling leakage current, is composed of the poly edge

Abstract- This paper describes a novel gate-level dual-
threshold total power optimization methodology
(GDTPOM) principle, which is based on the static timing
analysis (STA) and total power consumption optimization
techniques for designing high-speed low-power SOC
applications using 90nm MTCMOS technology. Based on
the GDTPOM principle, a multiplier circuit, which has
been designed using 90nm MTCMOS technology, has a
24.6% reduction in total power consumption.
1. Introduction
Design techniques of SOC applications
implemented using nanometer CMOS VLSI technology
have been evolving quickly [1]. Low power
consumption has always been a key requirement in the
system implementation. Multi-threshold CMOS
(MTCMOS) circuit techniques have been proven to be
an effective approach [2]-[5] in optimization of power
consumption for designing SOC systems. In this paper,
based on the power and timing optimization EDA tools,
using static timing analysis (STA) and total power
consumption optimization techniques, a gate-level dual-
threshold total power optimization methodology
(GDTPOM) is described. It will be shown that, based on
the GDTPOM principle, a 16-bit multiplier circuit,
which has been designed based on 90nm MTCMOS
technology, has a 24.6% reduction in the total power
consumption. In the following sections, the GDTPOM
principle is described first, followed by the performance
of the test multiplier circuit, discussion and conclusion.
2. Gate-Level Dual-Threshold Total Power
Optimization Methodology (GDTPOM)
Principle
Fig. 1 shows the flow chart of the gate-level dual-
threshold total power optimization methodology
(GDTPOM) principle used for designing high-speed
low-power SOC applications using MTCMOS
technology. As shown in the figure, an SOC design
written in register transfer language (RTL) is
synthesized in terms of a gate-level netlist of cells using
the low-threshold voltage (LVT) standard cell library
based on the 90nm MTCMOS technology. The 2nd step

is applying the testbench, which is used to conduct the
gate-level netlist simulation, to transform the inputs of
the design into value change dump (VCD) or fast signal
database (FSDB) files. Then, using the Prime Power
EDA tool to perform the total power consumption
analysis of the design, a list of cells, that are required to
swap from the LVT type to the (high-voltage threshold
voltage) HVT type to ensure that no LVT cells with a
total power consumption exceeding the limit, is
generated. A procedure Swap_Cell_List_l is carried out
to swap cells for creating the updated netlist of
HVT/LVT cells. Prime Time EDA tool is used to carry
out the static timing analysis (STA) such that a list of
cells that are required to swap from the HVT type to the
LVT type to meet the timing constraint, is reported.
Finally, the procedure Swap_Cell_List_2 is performed
to swap these cells for creating the optimized netlist
design.
In the flow of the GDTPOM principle, there are
two key blocks. The first key block is the total power

HVT since they have a total power consumption more
than 0.15JjW. After the STA optimization procedure
using Prime time EDA tool, as shown in Fig. 4(b), 242
cells out of 1915 are swapped from HVT to LVT since
the delay of all paths needs to meet the requirement of
2ns. One path (indicated in purple) between input IN1 8
and output P28 of this 16-bit multiplier circuit is used to
demonstrate the optimization procedure. As shown in
Fig 5(a), initially this path is in all-LVT. After
performing the total power consumption optimization
procedure, for those cells with the total power
consumption over 0.15JjW, they will be swapped from
LVT to HVT as shown in Fig. 5(b), which is correlated
to the purple path line as shown in Fig. 4(a) with a data
arrival time of 2.56ns, which is larger than the constraint
of 2ns. After the STA optimization procedure, as shown
in Fig 5(c), with some cells swapped back to LVT, its
data arrival time is 1.64ns, which meets the timing
constraint.
4. Discussion
More insight to the GDTPOM principle could be
obtained by further studying the function of the total
power consumption optimization procedure in the
GDTPOM principle. Fig. 6 shows the total power
consumption and data arrival time versus the number of
the total HVT cells of the 16-bit multiplier after the total
power consumption optimization procedure. After the
first 300 cells with the most total power consumption in
the 16-bit multiplier are swapped from LVT to HVT, the
total power consumption is reduced substantially- over
30% but the data arrival time is increased by
38%. After swapping the following 300 cells with the
most total power consumption to HVT, the total power
consumption could be cut further, however in a less
efficient way. Therefore, the swapping the first set of
300 cells with the most total power consumption is an
effective way in optimizing total power consumption. In
addition, the side effect of swapping from LVT to HVT-
the increased data arrival time could be lessed via the
STA optimization procedure. With the timing constraint
of 2ns as the data arrival time, the GDTPOM principle
based on the total power consumption optimization
procedure and the STA optimization procedure could
offer a 24.6% reduction in the total power consumption-
reducing from 758IJW using all-LVT to 571JjW using
LVT/HVT in 90nm MTCMOS technology.

circuit optimized by the GDTPOM principle using
90nm MTCMOS technology and generated by Astro.

Abstract- This paper reports an analysis of the STI-induced
mechanical stress-related breakdown characteristics of the
40nm PD SOl NMOS device with a closed-form formula. As
verified by the experimentally measured data, the 2D simulation
results and the closed-form formula, the breakdown voltage
becomes higher for the device with a smaller SID length of
O.17Jlm due to the weaker function of the parasitic bipolar
device, offset by the stronger impact ionization in the post-
pinchoff region. The breakdown voltage of this PD SOl NMOS
device is affected strongly by the STI-induced mechanical stress
effect when the SID length is smaller than O.2Jlm.
I. INTRODUCTION
Performance of CMOS devices could be affected by the
mechanical stress induced by STI [I]. Mechanical stress may
change several parameters of the CMOS devices [2]. For PD
SOl CMOS devices in the nanometer regime, the length of the
source/drain region may be very small; hence the STI-induced
mechanical stress effects cannot be neglected. Recently, STI-
induced mechanical stress effects on the kink effect behaviors
of the PD SOl NMOS devices have been reported [3]-[5]. In
this paper, an analysis of the STI-induced mechanical stress
related breakdown of the 40nm PD SOl NMOS device with a
closed-form formula is described. In the following sections,
the breakdown characteristics are reported first, followed by
the closed-form formula and discussion.

stress and the related bandgap narrowing distribution in the

correlated to the mechanical stress, has a strong influence in
the breakdown behavior of the device.

VG=O.4V and Vo=2V. From this figure, the current
conduction mechanism as shown in Fig. 5 [8] could be
obtained. Considering the effects of the impact ionization
and the parasitic bipolar device, the drain current is composed
of the channel current (Ieh), the impact ionization current (Ih),
and the collector current (Ie) of the parasitic bipolar device:
lo=lch+Ih+Ie(I), where the impact ionization current (Ih) is a
function of the channel current (Ich) and a portion of the
collector current (k'le): Ih=(M-I)(Ieh+k'le) (2). M-I is the
multiplication factor, which could be expressed as follows:
M-I=a(V0-Vdsat)exp(-~N0-Vdsat) [9]. The breakdown voltage
is defined as the drain voltage when the slope of the drain
current characteristics as shown in Fig. 2 reaches ImAN.

voltage of the 40nm PD SOl NMOS device with the SID

formula, the measured data and the 20 simulation results. As
shown in the figure, when the gate voltage decreases the
breakdown voltage becomes larger. With a smaller SID
length, the breakdown voltage becomes higher. From this
figure, as verified by the 2D simulation results and the
experimentally measured data, the closed-form breakdown
voltage formula could predict the breakdown behavior very
well.
IV. DISCUSSION
More insights into the role of STI-induced bandgap
narrowing in the breakdown mechanism could be obtained by
studying the current gain (~o=aoIl-Oo) of the parasitic bipolar
device and the multiplication factor (M-I) of the impact
ionization versus VGofthe 40nm PO SOl NMOS device as
where ~Ege and ~gb are bandgap narrowing in the emitter
and the base, respectively. a and ~ are the parameters used in
the M-I formula. ~ is dependent on the bandgap narrowing
in the post-pinchoff region mostly near the drain [II]. From
Eq.(4), the breakdown voltage is dependent on the parasitic
bipolar device parameter- 00 and the impact ionization
parameter-~, which are closely correlated to the bandgap
narrowing due to the STI-related mechanical stress.

Abstract-This paper reports modeling the 
parasitic bipolar device in the 40nm PD SOI 
NMOS device considering the floating body 
effect. Using a unique extraction method, the 
function of the parasitic bipolar device during  
transient operations could be modeled. During 
the turn-on transient by imposing a step voltage 
from 0V to 2V at the gate, the case with a slower 
rise time shows a faster turn-on in the drain 
current due to a stronger function of the 
parasitic bipolar device from smaller 
displacement currents through the gate oxide, 
as reflected in the current gain, as verified by 
the experimentally measured results. 
I. Introduction 
Floating body effect of PD SOI CMOS 
devices have been studied intensively in 
the past [1][2]. The parasitic bipolar device 
in the PD device, which could cause the 
Kink effect, is difficult to model [3][4]. In 
fact, the parasitic bipolar device is 
important for the behavior of the PD SOI 
CMOS devices. In this paper, using a 
unique extraction method, the function of 
the parasitic bipolar device during DC and 
transient operations could be modeled. It 
will be shown that during the turn-on 
transient by imposing a step voltage from 
0V to 2V at the gate, the case with a 
slower rise time shows a faster turn-on in 
the drain current due to a stronger function 
of the parasitic bipolar device as reflected 
in the current gain as verified by the 
experimentally measured results. In the 
following section, the test device is 
described first, followed by the DC and the 
transient operations and discussion.

a p-type doping density of 3x1018cm-3
above a buried oxide of 145nm and a gate 
oxide of 1.5nm. A 65nm LDD region doped 
with an n-type density of 1019cm-3 under a 
sidewall spacer has been used. A nickel

partitioned charge model (QS, QD) for the 
surface channel of the device with the 
current conduction mechanism described 
in the DC condition, one may obtain the 
multiplication factor (M-1) and the current 
gain of the parasitic bipolar device during 
the turn-on transient of the test device.
Fig. 4 shows the multiplication factor 
(M-1) considering the impact ionization in 
the post-saturation region in the lateral 
channel and the current gain of the 
parasitic bipolar device of the PD SOI 
NMOS device during the turn-on transient 
by imposing a step voltage from 0V to 2V 
at the gate for the cases with the rise times 
of 10ns and 100ns based on the 2D 
simulation result. As shown in the figure, 
along with the progress of time during the 
ramp-up period, the multiplication factor 
(M-1) decreases due to the increase of the 
gate voltage leading to a smaller post-
saturation region. On the other hand, when 
the gate voltage is small during the initial 
stage of the ramp-up period, the current 
gain of the parasitic bipolar device is 
relatively small, indicating that the parasitic 
bipolar device is not turned on yet. During 
the final stage of the gate ramp-up period, 
the current gain suddenly increases, which 
implies the turn-on of the parasitic bipolar 
device. As shown in the solid-lines, for the 
case with the longer rise time of 100ns, 
both M-1 and the current gain are larger, 
which means the impact ionization in the 
post-saturation region is larger and the 
parasitic bipolar device functions stronger. 
IV. Discussion 
More insight into the operation of the 
parasitic bipolar device in the PD SOI 
NMOS device during the turn-on transient 
could be obtained by the studying the 2D  
density contours in the thin film of the 
device at the end of the gate voltage ramp 
as shown in Fig. 5. As shown in the figure, 
for the rise time of 100ns, the less electron 
content in the  thin  film  implies a  stronger

function of the parasitic bipolar device. 
Hence, the drain current is larger for the 
case with the rise time of 100ns. With a 
larger rise time, the drain and source 
displacement currents (dQD/dt, dQS/dt) 
become smaller. As a result, more holes 
generated by the impact ionization in the 
post-saturation region stay at the bottom of 
the thin film, becoming the base current of 
the parasitic bipolar device. Therefore, the 
function of the parasitic bipolar device is 
stronger, leading to a larger drain current.

terms of hydrostatic pressure is large in the SA near STI and de-
creases away from it. The corresponding BGN, which is correlated
to the mechanical stress, has a dramatic impact on the saturation
region Kink effect behaviour of the 40 nm PD NMOS device.
3. Saturation region Kink effect behaviour
Fig. 3 shows ID versus VD of the 40 nm PD NMOS device with SA
of 1.7 lm and 0.17 lm, biased with its body ﬂoating, based on the
experimentally measured data and 2D device simulation results
using the mechanical stress model and the corresponding BGN
model. In order to discriminate the BGN effect in the BJT from that
in the II region, 2D device simulation results based on the II model
considering BGN and without have been done. As shown in the ﬁg-
ure, with a smaller SA of 0.17 lm, the Kink effect behaviour occurs
at a larger VD as compared to the case with the SA of 1.7 lm. Con-
sidering BGN in the II model, the Kink effect behaviour occurs at a
smaller VD. Without considering BGN in the II model while doing
the 2D device simulation, the curves shift to the right. Please note
that 2D simulation with and without considering the tunnelling
leakage current model has been done. Although the tunnelling
leakage current has a substantial effect on the gate current, the
drain current characteristics in the saturation region remain the
same with and without considering the tunnelling leakage current.
The difference between the simulation results and the experimen-
tal data is mainly due to the limitation of the mobility model used.

teristics of the PD device with the SA of 0.17 lm and 1.7 lm, based

II model, the difference in base-emitter voltage (DVbe) between the
cases for the 40 nm PD SOI NMOS devices with the SA of 0.17 lm
and 1.7 lm is 107 mV at VG = 0.8 V and 40 mV at VG = 0.4 V. The
parasitic BJT is more difﬁcult to turn on for the case with the SA
of 0.17 lm as compared to the case with the SA of 1.7 lm due to
the more negative value of DEgb  DEge. Therefore, the function
of the parasitic BJT in the thin ﬁlm of the device with the shorter
SA of 0.17 lm becomes weaker due to the BGN effect.
In addition to the BJT effect, the Kink effect behaviour is also af-
fected by the II in the high electric ﬁeld region near the drain. BGN
in the high electric ﬁeld region may help the II [10]. As shown in
Fig. 7 and Table 2, considering BGN in the II model, the difference
in VBE (DVbe) between the cases for the 40 nm PD SOI NMOS device
with the SA of 0.17 lm and the 1.7 lm becomes smaller. At
VD = 0.8 V, DVbe shrinks from 107 mV to 57 mV at VG = 0.8 V and
from 43 mV to 1.4 mV at VG = 0.4 V. Therefore, the Kink effect
behaviour in the saturation region occurs at a higher VD for the
40 nm PD device with a smaller SA of 0.17 lm due to the higher
body-source BGN effect on the parasitic BJT from the higher STI-in-
duced mechanical stress, offset by the II enhanced by the BGN in
the high electric ﬁeld region near the drain.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, the STI-induced mechanical stress-related Kink ef-
fect behaviour of the 40 nm PD SOI NMOS device has been re-
ported. As veriﬁed by the experimentally measured data and the
2D simulation results, the Kink effect behaviour in the saturation
region occurs at a higher VD for the 40 nm PD device with a smaller
SA of 0.17 lm as compared to the one with the SA of 1.7 lm due to
the higher body-source BGN effect on the BJT from the higher STI-
induced mechanical stress, offset by the II enhanced by the BGN in
the high electric ﬁeld region near the drain.
