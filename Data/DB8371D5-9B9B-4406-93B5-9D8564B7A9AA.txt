Abstract 
 
This 3-year project is intended to make further development on high-entropy alloys by 
exploiting the peculiar phenomena and potential applications. It comprises two parts. The first 
part is to compare arc melting, rapid solidification and mechanical alloying process on binary to 
octonary alloys and to investigate the basic effect of mixing entropy on Young’s modulus by 
mechanical alloying. The results show that the hardness increases with increasing the number of 
elements. This demonstrates the binding energy effect and lattice distortion effect on hardness. 
Moreover, two linear relations have been found to exist between the increase of Young’s modulus 
and mixing enthalpy, and exist between the increase of Young’s modulus and mixing free energy. 
However, the latter displays better linearity than the former. This demonstrates that mixing 
entropy basically has an enhanced effect for Young’s modulus and thus the strength. 
The second part is on the sluggish diffusion in high-entropy alloys. Different compositions 
of CoCrFeMnNi alloy with single FCC phase are designed as different diffusion couples which 
are annealed at high temperatures for certain time. From the concentration profiles of HEA 
diffusion couples, the diffusivities, activation energies, and pre-exponential factors, D0, have been 
determined. The results show that the diffusion coefficients normalized by the melting 
temperature of matrix alloy are smaller in HEA systems than those in pure metals or traditional 
alloys. Moreover, we propose a model to demonstrate the difficulty of cooperative diffusion for 
phase transformation in HEAs. Thus, the he sluggish diffusion effect in high-entropy alloys is due 
to the low diffusion rate and the difficulty of cooperative diffusion. Based on this advantage, we 
develop Ni22 alloy which shows very low grain growth exponent, n = 0.104 due to sluggish 
diffusion effect. Through grain refinement, the Ni22 HEA is found to exhibit superior 
strength-ductility combination than commercial stainless steels.

B. 高熵合金中的原子擴散行為 
第一年由先前的研究成果中，統整高熵
合金的微結構與熱動力學間之關聯，加強多
元下擴散模型的探討。第二年以擴散偶
(diffusion couple)實驗分析 CoCrFeMnNi五元
高熵合金系統中Cr和Mn原子的擴散係數和
擴散活化能。第三年繼續以擴散偶實驗分析
Fe 和 Ni 原子的相關數據，並檢驗先前所建
立之擴散模型。另外將高熵合金冷加工並退
火處理，分析再結晶後的高熵合金之晶粒成
長速率以驗證緩慢擴散效應。 
 
四、研究內容及成果 
A. 混合熵對楊氏模數的影響 
首先利用機械合金法、快速凝固法及電
弧熔煉法，配製二至八元合金，分析合金粉
末之機械性質，探討混合熵對楊氏模數之影
響，並且探討合金系統由傳統二元演變至八
元高熵合金時，機械性質之變化。 
機械合金法製備合金時，針對不同球磨
時間之合金粉末做分析，發現球磨 12 小時
後，二至八元合金皆為單一固溶體相，如圖
一所示，即使為多元系統，仍能形成簡單之
BCC/FCC 固溶相，因此取球磨 12 小時之合
金粉末，和快速凝固法及電弧熔煉法製備之
合金做比較。圖二為三種製程之合金元數對
維氏硬度之關係圖，由圖中可發現，無論製
程為何，合金之硬度皆會隨元數增加而上
升，此一趨勢顯示由傳統合金延伸進入高熵
合金時，多元效應增加了原子之間的鍵結及
晶格扭曲，因而具有提昇合金機械性質的效
果；若單以製程作比較時，可發現機械合金
法之試片具有最高之硬度，快速凝固法次
之，而電弧熔煉法最低，此結果相當合理，
機械合金之試片因經過大量應變、加工硬化
的效果，因此具有最高的硬度，而快速凝固
與電弧熔煉法皆為液-固相反應之製程，因此
硬度相近，但快速凝固法冷卻速度較快，其
內部微結構較細且成份偏析較少，因此具有
較高的硬度。由此可知，純固態反應的機械
合金製程，具有混合均勻、避免成份偏析的
優點，因此後續以機械合金之試片作進一步
探討。 
圖三為二至八元合金長時間球磨粉末之
X-ray 繞射圖形，由圖中可發現，即使經過
60小時的球磨，屬於傳統合金範疇的二元及
三元合金，仍是維持固溶體相，而四至八元
合金經長時間球磨之後，皆可形成非晶質
相，僅八元合金仍有部份 Mo 殘留。圖四為
二至八元合金長時間球磨之硬度，與圖二比
較可發現硬度與元數之間並無明顯之趨勢。
利用 nano-indentation分析長時間球磨之合金
粉末，可得合金之楊氏模數如圖五所示，可
知模數隨元數增加而下降，在四元後約趨於
定值。若進一步將非晶之四至七元合金粉末
繪製硬度與模數之關係，並和文獻之數據比
較，則如圖六所示，得到重要結果。圖中顯
示傳統塊狀非晶質合金系統之硬度與楊氏模
數呈現 Hv = 6.88 E之線性關係[9]，而非晶的
四至七元粉末亦相當符合此一關係，此顯示
機械合金法的非晶粉末與塊材非晶硬度及模
數關係相似。至於高熵合金中混合熵對模數
及硬度的影響，則有待進一步探討。 
由於粉末試片無法利用拉伸試驗的方式
直接獲得楊氏模數，故須採用其他方式量
測。由文獻中指出[10]，在完全加工硬化的系
統中，楊氏模數約是降伏強度的一百倍，而
由經驗中大部分的金屬材料，其降伏強度約
是維氏硬度的三分之一，因此只要量測合金
的維氏硬度，即可間接獲得其楊氏模數。 
表一為二至八元合金經機械合金法球磨
12小時後所測得之硬度，並和利用電弧熔煉
法所得之相同成份之合金硬度作比較，可發
現兩者之間有明顯差異。無論是機械合金或
電弧熔煉，當合金元數增加時，合金硬度亦
  4 
素有濃度梯度，如圖九所示，其中(a)系統只
改變 Cr 與 Mn 的成份，而(b)系統只改變 Fe
與 Ni的成份。 
本實驗中使用的 diffusion couple裝置如
圖十所示，將適當厚度的高熵合金(HEA1,2)
圓形試片表面拋光後置入由鉬製成的罐狀容
器中，利用鉬比大多數金屬熱膨脹係數低
(~5×10-6 /K)的特色，升溫後可使試片因膨脹
受到限制而產生壓力，使試片互相接合。改
變熱處理的溫度及時間，便可得到多組獨立
的 diffusion couple，而試片在進行擴散前，
皆預先以長時間的熱處理使試片達到穩定
態，避免其他因素影響擴散實驗的結果。 
試片經過不同溫度和時間的擴散熱處理
後，取橫截面進行線掃瞄成份分析及 curve 
fitting 如圖十一所示。而各元素擴散係數的
計算採用 Sauer-Freise method[12]，再將擴散
係數取對數對溫度之倒數作圖(圖十二)，即可
求得擴散活化能和 D0值。 
表四顯示並比較 Cr、Mn、Fe、Ni 在
CoCrFeMnNi 高熵合金及 FCC 的 Fe、Co、
Ni 純金屬中的擴散係數、活化能 Q、D0、
Q/Tm。圖十三為各種基材中（包括不同不鏽
鋼）原子擴散係數在 0.8 Tm（基材熔點）時
的比較，可看出高熵合金中的擴散遠低於純
金屬基地，且低於不鏽鋼，此顯示高熵合金
確實使元素的擴散速率變慢。 
擴散係數描述原子的擴散速度，但對於
相變化而言，一個新相的形成需要多種元素
原子的合作擴散，以造成成份重配
(partitioning)，然而多元素時，擴散較慢的元
素成為拖延反應，決定新相形成的因素，所
以合作擴散也是緩慢相變化的因素之一。因
此，多種原子的合作擴散，及元素本身的緩
慢擴散，其綜合結果即可解釋高熵合金相變
化較慢的現象，例如傾向形成固溶相或奈米
結構，增進再結晶溫度及抵抗高溫軟化。 
晶粒成長較慢也是緩慢擴散效應的一種
表現。為了分析高熵合金中的晶粒成長速
率，我們由 AlCoCrFeNi五元合金系統中開發
出含 22at%Ni 的 Ni22 高熵合金，具有單一
FCC 相且加工性優越。此研究利用冷滾壓搭
配退火之熱機處理法分析 Ni22 合金的晶粒
成長速率，同時達到細晶強化效果，得到一
強度與延性的綜合表現優異的新合金。 
Ni22合金鑄造態及均質化態下硬度皆為
HV171，均質化後的晶粒為數百微米，經滾壓
85%後硬度提昇至 HV393。滾壓材在不同溫度
及不同時間下退火，因退火軟化、富 Ni、Al
相析出硬化及細晶強化之不同，可得到不同
的晶粒尺寸及硬化量，最硬為 700°C退火 30
分鐘達 HV501。若排除析出硬化之影響，在
1000°C退火 2分鐘可得晶粒 9.4微米，硬度
HV210，顯現細晶強化的效果。圖十四為
1000°C不同時間退火之晶粒成長曲線，套入
晶粒成長方程式： 
  D = ktn 
其中 D為平均晶粒尺寸，k為成長常數，t為
時間，n為時間指數，可得到此合金於 1000°C
晶粒成長的時間指數 n = 0.104，較傳統合
金的常見值低很多，此顯示 Ni22合金的晶粒
成長緩慢，顯然為緩慢擴散效應的一種表
徵。圖十五為 Ni22合金與 304不鏽鋼的平均
晶粒尺寸對硬度之關係，顯示 Ni22 合金較
304不鏽鋼高。 
將 Ni22 滾壓材經不同溫度退火後進行
拉伸試驗，結果如圖十六所示，曲線皆呈延
性材料的表現，拉伸應力過降伏點後仍持續
上升，顯示其加工硬化性佳。圖十七為硬度、
降伏強度、抗拉強度及總伸長率隨不同退火
溫度的變化，可見總伸長率隨退火溫度增加
而上升，強度及硬度隨退火溫度增加而下
降。圖十八為不同溫度退火下之硬度對強度
關係，驗證其硬度與降伏強度及抗拉強度呈
線性關係，抗拉強度對硬度斜率接近經驗值
3.33。圖十九為 Ni22合金經不同細晶製程後

With an aim to bridge traditional alloys and high-entropy alloys with the alloying and amorphization
behaviors, the present study usedmechanical alloying (MA) to prepare a series of binary to octonary alloys
selected from Cu, Ni, Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ti, andMo in sequence. Binary and ternary alloys formed FCC phase and
BCC phase, respectively, and no amorphization was found even after 60h milling. Quaternary to octonary
alloys ﬁrst formed FCC solid solution and then transformed into amorphous phase after prolongedmilling.
Thus, the ﬁrst kind of amorphization process proposed by Weeber and Bakker based on binary systems
also occurs in the present multi-principal-element alloys. The preference of FCC solution phase over BCC
one is due to the easiest mixing of Cu, Ni, Al, and Co in the early stage in which Cu, Ni, and Co are FCC
formers. The diffuse scattering in XRD reﬂecting the lattice distortion is arisenmore signiﬁcantly from the
atomic size difference than that from heavy plastic deformation. A wider range of atomic size difference
provided by more constituent elements is beneﬁcial to form the amorphous structure and increase the
diffuse scattering.

1. Introduction
Within traditional alloy concept, most alloys are composed of
one principal metal element, such as Fe- (steel), Cu-, Al-, Ti-, Mg-,
and Ni-based alloys. Even in recently developed bulk amorphous
alloys, most alloys are also based on one principal metal element
[1–3]. It has reached a diminishing return in developing more
advanced alloys by the end of last century based on such a con-
cept. In order to search for more promising alloys, Yeh et al. [4–6]
started exploration of multi-principal-element alloys named as
“High-Entropy Alloys” (HEAs) since 1995. HEAs are composed of
at least ﬁve principal elements, each of which has an equal atomic
percentage or that between 5 and 35at.%. They are characteristic of
highentropydue to their relativelyhigher conﬁgurational entropies
than those of traditional alloys as compared in the liquid state or
regular solid solution state. For HEAs, high entropy leads to three
core effectiveness, i.e. sluggish diffusion, severe lattice distortion
and cocktail effects [6], which are all less pronounced in traditional
alloys. Many attractive features of HEAs have been reported in suit-

ably designedHEAs such as: (1) tendency to formsimple FCCand/or
BCC solid solution(s), (2) easy formation of nano-sized precipitates
and even amorphous phases, (3) exhibition of good thermal sta-
bility, (4) possessing high hardness, and (5) displaying excellent
corrosion resistance [7–15].
With an aim to understand more intrinsic behaviors of HEAs,
the present studywas focusing on the bridging between traditional
alloys and HEAs to see how the microstructure evolves by adding
more and more elements in the alloys prepared by mechanical
alloying (MA). It is also interesting to seewhether there is an exten-
sion or not the known phenomena from traditional alloys to HEAs.
For this purpose, a series of seven alloys, from binary to octonary
one (Cu0.5Ni, Cu0.5NiAl, Cu0.5NiAlCo, etc and Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFeTiMo,
all in molar ratio) were designed, in which binary to quaternary
alloys belong to traditional alloys whereas quinary to octonary
alloys fall in the category of high-entropy ones. MA is a high-
energy process which could transform elemental materials into an
alloy by repeated fracture and cold welding under the continuous
impacting action of amillingmedium. Thismethodwas ﬁrst devel-
opedbyBenjamin in 1966 and applied to fabricate oxide-dispersion
strengthening Ni- and Fe-based superalloys [16]. Although lots of
alloy systems have been studied afterwards [17–21], seldom works
could be found for multi-principal-element alloys like HEAs. Only

under XRD analysis, they were analyzed by SEM-EDS to check their
compositions. The results are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that
the concentration deviations of each element from nominal com-
positions are less than 2at.%. Although quantitative quality of EDS
is usually not very good, the analysis result is found to be quite
plausible for equal-mole or near equal-mole alloys. This is because
each major element has a signiﬁcant amount well above the pre-
cision of EDS. The content of oxygen and nitrogen of the powders
with prolonged milling is listed in Table 2. The oxygen contents
in binary to octonary alloy powders are 0.17–0.78wt. % while the
nitrogen contents 20–80ppm. This indicates that theoxidationdur-
ing mechanical alloying process was very limited.
3.2. Evolution of phases and grain size
3.2.1. Cu0.5Ni alloy
Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of Cu0.5Ni alloy powders with differ-
entmilling times. It can be seen that the peaks of Cu andNi become
lowered with increasing milling time and a new FCC solid solution
phase with in-between peaks forms after MA for 2h. At MA 3h this
FCC solution phase is the only phase under the resolution of XRD
analysis. This is reasonable since the alloying portion between Cu
and Ni will lead to a lattice constant between that of Cu and Ni,
and increases in proportion until full alloying (4h) is reached. It
also reveals that the lattice constant of this solid solution changes
from 3.57Å (4h) to 3.60Å (60h). This is mainly attributable to the
increased amount of point defects, such as interstitial atoms and
vacancies, which can expand the lattice [23,24]. In addition, the
grain size (d) calculated by Scherrer equation [24] from the ﬁrst

tion from the ordered BCC phase for Cu0.5NiAl alloy to FCC phase
for Cu0.5NiAlCo alloy is explainable since Co is a strong FCC for-
mer besides Cu and Ni [25] and hence leads to a more stable FCC
phase. However, as Co is similar to Ni in many aspects, Cu–Ni–Al
phase diagram is tentatively used to determine equilibrium phases
of the present composition with pseudo-alloy concept. By this, the
equilibrium phases should be a mixture of B2-type (Ni, Co)Al and
L12-type (Ni, Co)3Al. Hence, the preference of a single FCC phase
from 6 to 48h indicates that metastable FCC phase is dominant
over BCC under MA. That means MA leads to a stable FCC solu-
tion phase. The lattice constant of FCC phase increases from 3.59Å
(6h) to 3.63Å (48h) which is also due to increased point defects.
Grain size of the FCC phase is 4.4–5.3nm during MA for 6 to 48h as
shown in Fig. 4. But, XRD amorphous phase is ﬁnally obtained after
milling for 60h. This reﬂects much more deformation introduced
byMA can gradually destroy or destabilize the crystalline structure
of this quarternary alloy.
3.2.4. Cu0.5NiAlCoCr alloy
XRD patterns of Cu0.5NiAlCoCr alloy powders with different
milling times are shown in Fig. 5. After MA for 4h, a new FCC solid
solutionphase forms accompanyingwith thedisappearance of XRD
peaks of Cu, Ni, Al, and Co, except Cr. The slowest dissolution of
Cr is due to its highest bonding energy (the highest melting point)
among theﬁve elements and thus the lowest diffusion rate for other
elements to diffuse into its matrix. An amorphous phase indicated
by the broad overlapping peak centered at around 43◦ forms at MA
24h although elemental Cr still remains with much reduced inten-

shows an amorphous diffuse ring which corresponds to the amor-
phous broad peak in its XRD pattern. Dark ﬁeld image obtained by
choosing a part of the diffuse ring reveals that the whole particle
becomes bright and has lots of white dots smaller than 1nm dis-
persed throughout its matrix. This demonstrates that the particle
has a homogeneous amorphous structure with short-range-order
clusters. Similar phenomena have been found in other amorphous
alloy powders.
4. Discussion
4.1. Preference of forming FCC solution phase among studied
alloys
Except the ternary alloyCu0.5NiAl, thepreferenceof forming FCC
solid solution phase to BCC phase in addition to other compound
phases is found for all alloys. For binary alloy Cu0.5Ni, it is trivial
to understand this preference since Cu and Ni can form continuous
equilibrium FCC solution phase based on its binary phase diagram.
For ternary alloy Cu0.5NiAl, it is also easy to understand since the
orderedBCCsolid solution (B2)ofNiAl compound is theequilibrium
phase in Cu–Ni–Al phase diagram. However, for quaternary alloy
Cu0.5NiAlCo, FCC phase is formed and ordered BCC phase is inhib-
ited althoughboth are predicted to coexist based onpseudoCu–(Ni,
Co)–Al phase diagram. This FCC phase further becomes amorphous
after an extended milling. By adding more elements such as Cr, Fe,
Ti, and Mo one at a time to form higher order alloys, the FCC solu-
tion phase is still the main phase initially formed and then become
amorphous to accommodate more elements. Therefore, Cu, Ni, Al,
and Co are the four important elements to determine FCC phase.
By kinetics point of view, Cu, Ni, Al, and Co are the four elements
with lowermeltingpoint in thepresent alloy systemandhence eas-
ier to mix up in the early stage. By thermodynamics point of view,
Cu, Ni, and Co are FCC formers with transition metals, while Al is
a strong BCC former with transition metals due to the formation
of directional p–d hybrid orbitals. However, Al becomes dilute in
higher order alloys as compared with that in ternary alloy. In addi-
tion the severe lattice distortion of FCC solution phase imposed
by MA might extend its solubility for Al. Table 3 lists the bond-
ing energies of the possible unlike atom pairs [27]. Table 4 shows
the enthalpy of mixing for each alloy composition in the random

4.2. Diffuse scattering in X-ray diffraction due to severe lattice
distortion
It is well known that diffuse scattering in XRD mainly comes
from lattice distortion because those atoms deviated from a plane
satisfying Bragg’s law would scatter incident X-ray to the back-
ground. Thus larger distortion would cause lower peak intensity
and even low broad peak is obtained for the case of amorphous
structure. Lattice distortion could be induced by point defects and
thermal vibration besides the atomic size difference. In the present
case, thermal vibration is not considered to be a factor among
different alloys because all the XRDs were performed at room tem-
perature. Thus, the latticedistortiondue topointdefects introduced
by deformation during mechanical milling and that coming from
the difference in atomic sizes are considered. Fig. 12 shows XRD
patterns of binary to octonary alloy powders with similar long-
time milling (36 and 60h, respectively). It can be seen that the
diffraction intensities of ternary alloy are higher than that of binary
alloy, but after it, the intensities precipitously decrease with the
increasing number of elements. Although amorphous structure of
higher order alloys is used for the comparison, the same trend is
obtained if the crystalline state with a shorter milling time prior
to the amorphous state (see Figs. 4–7 and 9) is used for compari-
son. As for the higher intensity of ternary alloy than that of binary
alloy, it is attributable to the fact that ternary alloy has the strong
bonding ordered structure, B2 showing higher crystallinity than
that of binary one. As a summary, adding more different elements
would further produce a signiﬁcant degree of distortion and result
in remarkable diffuse scattering even though heavy deformation
and thus point defects have been imposed on all alloys by MA with
prolonged milling. Yeh et al. [29] reported the similar decrease of
peak intensity with the increasing number of element in an alloy
series of Cu–Ni–Al–Co–Cr–Fe–Si prepared by melting and cast-
ing. The anomalous decrease was attributed to the intrinsic severe
lattice distortion effect caused by the addition of multi-principal
elements with different atomic sizes.
4.3. Belonging to the ﬁrst kind of amorphization process by MA
With a certain milling time, the quaternary to octonary alloy
powders begin to form amorphous structure and all the transitions
are found to start fromtheelemental state toFCCsolid solutionstate
and then to amorphous state. Such transition is just of the ﬁrst kind
of processes in forming amorphous phase byMAproposed byWee-
ber and Bakker [18] based on binary systems. The other two kinds
differ fromtheﬁrstone in the transitionstate, that is, the secondone
has no transition state such that amorphous state is directly formed
from elemental state. The third one has the transition state of inter-
metallic compound(s). Thus, the present observation demonstrates
that amorphization process of the ﬁrst kind also occurs in multi-
principal-element alloys. Other kinds of transition may occur in
other alloy systems yet further veriﬁcation will be required. The
reason for the ﬁrst kind in the present multi-component alloys is
quite straightforward since the four low-melting-point elements,
Cu, Ni, Al, and Co, prefers to form the ﬁrst FCC solution phase. Based
on the high-entropy effect in inhibiting the intermetallic phase and
enhancing solid solution phase in most HEAs [5,6], it appears that
the second kind is much less likely. On the other hand, the direct
formation of amorphous phase during MA, i.e. of the second kind,
would easily occur in the alloys having components with chemical
compatibility but sufﬁcient large difference in atomic size.
5. Conclusions
A series of alloys from binary to octonary selected from Cu, Ni,
Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ti, and Mo in sequence were prepared by mechanical
alloying (MA). SEM, EDS, XRD and EXAFS were used to investi-
gate theirphaseevolutionandamorphizationbehaviorsduringMA.
Conclusions are drawn below.
(1) Binary and ternary alloys form FCC and BCC structures, respec-
tively and remain crystalline even after 60h milling. For
quaternary and alloys with more components, FCC solution
phase is ﬁrst formed and then transformed into amorphous
phase after prolonged milling.
(2) Before amorphization the FCC solution phase preferentially
forms consistingmainly of Cu, Ni, Al and Co inwhich Cu, Ni, and
Co are FCC formers. The dissolution of more elements such as
Cr, Fe, Ti andMo into the amorphous phase increases the degree
of disorder of amorphous structure. This reﬂects the accommo-
dation ability of FCC and amorphous structures are quite large
for different kinds of element during mechanical alloying.
(3) The diffuse scattering in XRD due to the difference in atomic
sizes for multi-component alloys is more signiﬁcant than that
due to the defects introduced by heavy plastic deformation.
(4) A wider range of atomic size difference provided by more con-
stituent elements is beneﬁcial to form the amorphous structure
and increase the diffuse scattering.
(5) Amorphization process of the ﬁrst kind proposed by Weeber
and Bakker based on binary systems occurs in the present
multi-principal-element alloys since all the transitions are from
the elemental state to a crystalline solid solution state and then
to the amorphous state.

The competition between the constituent elements of the Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFeTiMo alloy system during
mechanical alloying was investigated and ranked with their alloying rates in getting alloyed in the
mixture. By using XRD analysis, EDS mapping, extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure technique, and
synchrotron radiation diffraction, the alloying sequence for the present alloy system is determined as
Al→Cu→Co→Ni→ Fe→Ti→Cr→Mo in the order of decreasing alloying rate. The alloying rate is found
to correlate best with the melting point of the elements among metallurgical factors. The mechanism for
this correlation is explained through the effect of melting point on solid-state diffusion and mechanical
disintegration which are critical for the ﬁnal alloying. This ﬁnding is valuable in predicting the alloy-
ing sequence of elements, and thus the phase evolution in multi-component alloys during mechanical
alloying.

1. Introduction
Although most alloys contain a number of different elements,
and can therefore be referred to as being multi-component alloys,
they are nevertheless typically based upon one principal metal-
lic element occupying at least 50 at.% in the composition. Alloys
composed of three or more principal elements with similar molar
fractions are seldom reported besides the research for ternary
and higher order phase diagrams. The lack of scientiﬁc and tech-
nical interests in investigating alloys with a greater number of
principal components appears to relate with the anticipation that
such alloys will form complex and brittle microstructures with
many intermetallic compounds which are very difﬁcult to be anal-
ysed and understood [1]. To overcome these preconceptions for
multi-principal-component alloys Yeh and co-workers proposed
high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with at least ﬁve principal elements, in
which high mixing entropies in the liquid or regular solid solution
state could enhance the formation of solid solution phases [2–5]. It
has been determined that HEAs often possess simple microstruc-
tures and provide promising properties for wide range applications
[6–14].
Although HEAs have received more and more attention and
research, their thermodynamic equilibrium and kinetic behav-
iors are still lack of study, which are important to understand

microstructures and properties, and to design new alloys. In this
study, the gap between traditional and high-entropy alloys is
intended to be bridged with mechanically alloying method (MA)
by which some kinetic behaviors could be revealed. Thus, a series
of binary to octonary alloys with eight chemical compatible com-
mon elements, Cu, Ni, Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ti, and Mo, are designed,
experimented, andcompared to seeelemental alloying competition
during MA. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersion spectrum
(EDS) mapping, extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS),
and synchrotron radiation diffraction (SRD) analyses were used to
rank their alloying rates and determine the alloying sequence. It
should be mentioned that the chosen elements have atomic sizes
ranging from 1.25 to 1.46Å and melting points varying from 660
to 2617 ◦C. Three kinds of crystal structure, FCC, HCP, and BCC, are
involved. Moreover, seven alloys in total are experimented with
the repetition of constituent elements. This enables the alloying
competition to be checked with each other.
In the past two decades, there have been many researches on
mechanically alloyedmulti-element systems such as Ti–Ni–Cu [15],
Zr–Ti–Cu–Ni [16,17], and Zr–Ti–Al–Ni–Cu [18]. However, almost
all the compositions are based on one principal element having
a content more than 50at.%. Moreover, the alloying sequences
of the constituent elements were seldom investigated but the
phase evolution and/or ﬁnal state. Only one work on HEAs pre-
pared by MA was reported by Varalakshmi et al. [19]. In the study,

ferent milling time. It can be seen that peaks of Al decrease more
rapidly than other elements. Cu peaks essentially disappear while
peaks of Ni, Co, and Cr still remain after milling for 2h. Only peaks
of Ni and Cr are found for 3h. After milling for 4h, a FCC solid
solution phase formed with remained Cr peaks. After milling for
6h another BCC solid solution phase based on Cr forms but the
FCC solid solution phase almost disappears at the same time. After
milling for 36h the powder ﬁnally turns into amorphous struc-
ture. The phase evolution and its discussion of this alloy can be
referred to the previous research [21]. Consequently, from the XRD
patterns mentioned above, the alloying sequence of this quinary
alloy can be determined as Al→Cu→Co→Ni→Cr. Similarly, SEM
andEDSmappingwereused to check this sequence. Fig. 5 shows the
EDS mappings of the Cu0.5NiAlCoCr powders with different milling
times. Aftermilled for 1h, Fig. 5(a), concentrated spots can be found
in themappings of all elements except that Al almost becomes uni-
form and Cu has relatively few bright spots. After milling for 2h,
Fig 5(b), Cu distribution also becomes uniform while Co, Ni, and
Cr still have concentrated regions. After milling for 3h, as seen in
Fig. 5(c), Co becomes uniformly distributed, Ni has relatively few
bright spots but Cr still persists with many concentrated regions.

were used to determine the alloying sequence. It can be expected
that smaller amount of elemental powder in higher order pow-
der mixture would lead to decreased intensities of their XRD peaks
and lets the identiﬁcation more difﬁcult. Moreover when a solu-
tion phase forms, more solute elements would result in lower peak
intensities due to larger diffuse scattering effect exerted by lattice
distortion [20]. Therefore, EXAFS and SRD techniques were used
for a double check on the full range of the alloying sequence. Fig. 9
shows Fourier transformsof the EXAFSK-edge spectra for Cu,Ni, Co,
Cr, Fe, and Ti taken from the Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFeTiMo powder sample
milled for 36h. It reveals that the spectra of Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe have
their ﬁrst-shell peaks at the same radial coordinate whereas other
shells attenuate with small amplitudes. This indicates that these
four elements have lost their pure elemental structures and have
already dissolved into the same solid solution amorphous phase. In
contrary, Cr and Ti still show their own ﬁrst-, second-, and third-
shell peaks as seen in their typical elemental patterns. This implies
that Cr and Ti have not fully dissolved into the solution phase yet. It
is also noted that Ti’s spectra ismuch lower than Cr’s indicating that
Ti has a higher alloying rate thanCr. Therefore, EXAFS technique can
conﬁrm that the positions of Ti and Cr are after Al, Cu, Co, and Ni,
and that of Ti is before Cr in the alloying sequence of the octonary
alloy.
Fig. 10 shows the diffraction patterns transformed from syn-
chrotron radiation diffraction of Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFe powder and
Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFeTiMo powder, respectively. Two milling times of
36h and 60h were chosen for the analysis. The patterns display
much higher intensity and small noise than that from conventional
X-ray diffraction, which is beneﬁcial in phase identiﬁcation. For
Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFe powder an FCC solid solution phase and elemen-
tal Cr are identiﬁed after milling for 36h, and an amorphous phase
and some residue of elemental Cr coexists after milling for 60h.
This implies that Cr has the lowest alloying rate amongst these
six elements. Similarly for Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFeTiMo powder, elemen-
tal Mo and Cr exist with an amorphous solid solution phase after
milling for 36h and 60h. However, elemental Cr almost disap-
pears after 60h milling indicating that Cr has a higher alloying rate
than Mo. Therefore, SRD analysis can conﬁrm the relative positions
of Cr and Mo in the alloying sequence of the octonary alloy, i.e.
Al→Cu→Co→Ni→ Fe→Ti→Cr→Mo.
3.3. Metallurgical factor determining the alloying sequence
Then, what is the dominating factor affecting the alloying rate
and thus determining the alloying sequence of the experimental
elements? This understanding is important and valuable in the pre-
diction of alloying sequence and phase evolution during MA. Few
previous works investigated and explained the alloying competi-
tion between elements during MA but most concerned with the
phase evolution or the ﬁnal phase formed [15–18]. Schultz reported
the formation mechanism of amorphous metals and emphasized
that the ultra-ﬁne-layered microstructure produced by MA was
necessary before the formation of amorphous phase through
further interdiffusion [22]. He provided an example revealing the
phase evolution in the annealing of a sample composed of lamellar
Ni/Zr foils with a composition of Ni68Zr32. With a 4h-annealing,
it could be seen in the XRD pattern that an amorphous phase
existed with residual Ni. And with a 100h-annealing, all form an

is, highermelting temperature gives lower alloying rate. In conven-
tional alloy systems, it is well known from diffusion theory that
there is a close relation between diffusion coefﬁcient and melting
point. For a given crystal structure, a metal with higher melting
point has an increased bonding strength and thus a lower self-
diffusion coefﬁcient. Similarly an element with a higher melting
point would have a lower intrinsic diffusion coefﬁcient than that
with lower melting points in a solution matrix [25]. Although this
empirical relation is based on the diffusion of different species in
the same matrix with a host element, the present results demon-
strate that the above relationship can be extended to the intrinsic
diffusion of elements in the matrix with multi-principal-elements
[27].
It is also well known that interaction between different species
might affect the diffusion rate [25]. For example, the mixing of Au
and Ni gives a positive mixing enthalpy, i.e., they dislike each other.
It has been shown that their intrinsic diffusivities in a concentra-
tion gradient are smaller than tracer diffusivities determined with
a diffusion couple based on the chemically homogeneous Au–Ni
alloy. In contrary, negative mixing enthalpy would enhance dif-
fusion rate of the species [25]. Table 3 lists the bonding energies
[28,29] of the possible unlike atom pairs of the present alloy sys-
tem. It can be seen that there are positive, up to 19kJ/mole, and
negative, down to −35kJ/mole, mixing enthalpies among the pos-
sible pairs. If we choose the octonary alloy to check the possible
relation between bonding energy and the alloying rate ranked in
the alloying sequence Al→Cu→Co→Ni→ Fe→Ti→Cr→Mo, no
consistent relation between them can be found. For example, if a
summation of different bonding energies for each element is com-
pared, Al and Ti are the two strongest elements to bond with other
elements but they rank at the ﬁrst and sixth positions, respectively.
FurthermoreCuhas the lowest overall bondingwithother elements
but it ranks at the secondposition. This demonstrates that themelt-
ing point is still the dominant factor to determine the alloying rate
for the present alloy system. One possible explanation is that the
strongest interaction among different elements in the present sys-
tem is still not strong enough to overcome the effect of melting
point on diffusion rate. For the former, the effect is displayed with
themultiplying factor for intrinsic tracer diffusivity, which is called
as thermodynamic factor relating with the differential of activity
coefﬁcient [25]. For the latter, the effect is displayed with the acti-
vation energy in the exponential term, which is proportional to the
melting point in absolute temperature [25]. In summary, the domi-
nating factor is still themelting point of the elements in the present
system.

Besides the diffusion viewpoint, mechanical disintegration and
deformation structure of elemental particles are also considered.
For mechanical disintegration it is interesting to ﬁnd this factor is
also consistent with diffusion since an element with lower melting
point usually has lower hardness and thus bettermalleability to aid
their spatial dispersion. Thatmeans in the early stage ofmilling ele-
ments with better malleability such as Al and Cu can be spread out
faster in space and in the latter stage they can diffuse at a faster rate
into other elements or solution phases. Therefore, the mechanical
integration viewpoint also strengthens the dependence of alloying
rate on its melting point. On the other hand, the severe defor-
mation during MA would induce nanostructure and stored strain
energy in the particles. Koch [30] and Murty and Ranganathan [31]
have discussed about this with that for FCC elements having lower
melting points (Al, Ag, Cu, and Ni), the minimum grain size varies
inversely with their melting point, however, for BCC, HCP, and FCC
elementswith highermelting points, theminimumgrain size is vir-
tually insensitive to their melting points. In addition, lattice strain
or stored enthalpy rises with decreasing grain size, reaches a max-
imum, and then decreases to low values (lattice strain is around
0.1% and stored enthalpy is around 0.1 kJ/mole) for the minimum
grain sizes [30]. As the lattice strain and stored enthalpy is small,
minimum grain size is thus thought to be a possible factor to affect
the alloying rate of an element. However, it is apparent that the
ranking of alloying rate has no reasonable relationship with the
attainable minimum grain size. For Al, Cu, and Ni, it would lead to
that larger minimum grain size would give faster alloying rate. This
is unreasonable since the structure with smaller grain size is more
unstable than that with larger grain size in terms of overall grain
boundary energy. For Co, Fe, Ti, Cr, and Mo, minimum grain size
could not account for the variation of alloying rate since their mini-
mumgrain sizes are at the similar level. In summary, nanostructure
introduced by MA has a small inﬂuence on the ranking of alloying
rate.
As for the reverse tendency between Co and Ni, it is not read-
ily apparent when considering their melting point and atomic size
alone. As their diffusion coefﬁcients are very similar, a possible
explanation is proposed with the mechanical factor. That is the
reduced number of slip systems of the HCP structure making Co
more brittle and thus more prone to fragmentation than Ni dur-
ing the MA process. Therefore, the melting point is the primary
factor for determining the alloying rate of an element. Secondary
factors such as crystal structure becomemore important for similar
melting point elements.
3.4. Usefulness of the relationship between alloying rate and
melting point
The empirical relationship between alloying rate and melting
point would be useful in the prediction of alloying competition and
phase evolution for awide range alloys during the solid-state alloy-
ing. The alloying sequence of a set of elements to form a MA alloy
is much more important than the actual milling time required for a
certain degree of alloying since the former affects the phase evolu-
tion and ﬁnal phases formedwithin theMA alloy. This could aid the
understanding of thephase formationmechanism. The relationship

This investigation explores the deformation and annealing behaviors of high-entropy alloys using a duc-
tile high-entropy alloy of Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi. This alloy had excellent workability and exhibited a large work
hardening capacity in both hot forging and cold rolling. The main deformation and hardening mechanisms
during cold work are uniquely associated with the nanotwinning deformation of this alloy. The easy for-
mation of nanotwins appears to result from the blockage by the Widmanstätten Cu-rich precipitates of
local slip deformation in a space of several tens nanometers, and the low stacking fault energy, which
promotes the nucleation of nanotwins. This alloy was fully annealed in 5 h at 900 ◦C, revealing its sig-
niﬁcantly higher resistances to static anneal softening than traditional alloys with comparable melting
points. This resistance is attributable to extensive solution hardening, low stacking fault energy, and the
effect of sluggish diffusion on high-entropy alloys.

1. Introduction
Most traditional alloys are based on one host metallic element,
such as iron, aluminum, copper, titanium, or magnesium. In 1995,
a new concept that went beyond such conventional alloys was pro-
posed as a means of producing numerous other alloys [1]. The new
alloys have been called “high-entropy alloys” owing to the much
higher mixing entropies than traditional alloys in the liquid state
or random solid solution state. By deﬁnition, each such alloy has
at least ﬁve principal metallic elements, each with concentrations
between 5 at.% and 35 at.%. Recent developments in ﬁeld of high-
entropy alloys have revealed that they have versatile properties and
thus a number of promising applications [2–14].
Whether all phenomena of traditional alloys are exhibited by
correspondingly high-entropy alloys is of great interest. In the
wrought processing of traditional alloys [15,16], the microstructure
and mechanical properties of a cast ingot are well known to be
markedly affected by homogenization, hot working and cold work-
ing. Work-hardened stock can be recovered and/or recrystallized by
intermediate or ﬁnal annealing to restore its ductility and workabil-
ity. Vacancies, dislocations, twins and grain structures are the main
structural features that govern the effects of cold work, hot work
and annealing. The deformation and annealing behavior of a duc-

tile alloy, Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi, with favorable properties such as high
work hardening, elevated temperature strength, wear resistance
and oxidation resistance [4,6–8,14] were investigated to elucidate
the phenomena exhibited in high-entropy alloys. This investigation
is important to understand the extensibility of the phenomena that
are observed in traditional alloys.
2. Materials and methods
The high-entropy alloy Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi (subscripts mean molar ratio) was pre-
pared by arc-melting its constituent elements with at least 99 wt.% purity using a
current of 500 A in a water-cooled copper hearth. Melting and cooling were per-
formed in a vacuum of 0.01 atm after purging with argon three times. At least ﬁve
meltings were performed to improve the chemical homogeneity of the alloy. The
ﬁnal solidiﬁed slab had dimensions of 120 mm × 21 mm × 9 mm. After it was soaked
at 900 ◦C for 15 min, the cast slab was hot-forged with a thickness reduction of 40%
and then air-cooled. It was then homogenized at 1100 ◦C for 24 h. Two forms of
subsequent cooling to room temperature were applied: water quenching (WQ) and
furnace cooling (FC). The homogenized-FC slab was further cold rolled with thick-
ness reductions of 5%, 15%, 30% and 50%. The 50%-rolled specimens were ﬁnally
annealed at 900 ◦C for 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 h.
The metallographic specimens were prepared by cutting, grinding and polishing
in sequence. They were then etched with aqua regia, and observed under a scanning
electron microscope, JEOL-5410. The crystalline structure was analyzed using an
X-ray diffractometer, RIGAKU ME510-FM2, with Cu-target radiation at 30 kV and
20 mA. The sample was scanned at 2 angle from 20 to 100◦ with a scanning rate
of 4 deg/min. Thin-foil specimens were prepared by mechanical thinning followed
by ion milling at room temperature. They were then observed under a transmission
electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010,Tokyo, Japan). Hardness measurements
were made using a Vickers hardness tester, MATUSZAWA SEIKI MV-1, under a load
of 5 kg for a loading time 15 s. Measurements were made at least ﬁve points on each
specimen and averaged.

hot-forged sample and the homogenized-FC sample developed a
detectable amount of BCC phase.
The second FCC phase is the Cu-rich interdendritic phase which
initially appeared in the as-cast state, as reported upon elsewhere
[6–8]. Under the as-cast conditions, the lattice constant of the Cu-
rich phase is very close to that of the dendritic FCC phase, which
two phases are not easily distinguished by XRD. Forging or homoge-
nization adjusts the compositions of the constituent phases toward
equilibrium, and the Cu-rich FCC phase has its own set of peaks.
Fig. 2 compares the SEM microstructures of the four states. The
as-cast sample has a typical dendritic structure of dendrites and Cu-
rich interdendrite phases. Forging at 900 ◦C, reducing the thickness
by 40%, did not alter the dendritic morphology. However, the BCC
phase identiﬁed in the XRD patterns cannot be seen because of its
ﬁneness. Homogenizing at 1100 ◦C and quenching in water turned
the microstructure into a two-phase polygrain structure: the ﬁrst
FCC phase was formed from the cast dendrite and the second Cu-
rich FCC phase was formed from the Cu-rich interdendrite. Furnace
cooling after homogenization induced the formation of a coarse
BCC phase along grain boundaries and needle-like Widmanstät-
ten precipitates of Cu-rich phase inside the grains. The needle-like
precipitates become well contrasted as the plastic deformation
increases (see Fig. 3).

Tables 1 and 2 present the EDS analyses of the four states. The
interdendrite concentration of copper clearly exceeds that in the
dendrite. The interdendrite concentration of as-homogenized sam-
ples is even higher. Such segregation of copper could be explained
by the mixing enthalpy between the copper and the other elements,
as shown in Table 3. The positive mixing enthalpies demonstrate

the Cu-rich phase to hardening does not sufﬁciently account for
the work hardening. This fact suggests that even at 900 ◦C, the
present alloy exhibits a slow dynamic recovery to eliminate the
work hardening during hot forging. The effect is seldom exhib-
ited in conventional alloys based on Al, Co Cr, Cu, Fe or Ni. The
deformation on such conventional alloys above the recrystallization
temperature (approximately one half of the melting temperature
in degree Kelvin) easily induces dynamic recovery or even recrys-
tallization. Theoretically, dynamic recovery requires the climb of
edge dislocations and the cross-slip of screw dislocations to anni-
hilate dislocations and reduce dislocation density [18]. The present
alloy is less active in annihilating dislocations during hot working
than are conventional alloys. Three factors are proposed to explain
multi-principal-element effects involved in the present alloy: (1)
Solution hardening inhibits the slip or cross-slip of dislocations;
(2) Suzuki’s interaction in the whole-solute matrix signiﬁcantly
reduces the stacking fault energy and increases the spacing or
stacking fault between paired Shockley partial dislocations, making
cross-slip more difﬁcult; and (3) the equilibrium vacancy concen-
tration becomes low to reduce the activity of dislocation climb since
vacancies are less important in increasing the conﬁguration mix-
ing entropy in high-entropy alloys. These three mechanisms are
responsible for the slower dynamic recovery of high-entropy alloys
than that of conventional alloys.
3.2. Effects of cold rolling and deformation behavior
Table 5 lists the hardness of Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi alloys that have
undergone different amounts of cold rolling after homogenization
and furnace cooling. The hardness of as-homogenized-FC is also
compared. The work hardening capacity is signiﬁcant, since the
hardness increases by 60% from the as-homogenized-FC state to
the 50%-rolled state.
Fig. 3 shows the SEM microstructures in the rolling plane for
samples with different reductions in thickness. A needle-like Wid-
manstätten structure is found almost throughout the matrix. The
phase is about 0.2m long and 10–40 nm in width. However, this
phase is not a new phase formed by deformation, but is the existing
Cu-rich FCC phase revealed with greater contrast as the deforma-
tion strain increases. The TEM image of the as-homogenized-FC
sample, shown in Fig. 4, and the EDS composition analysis (Table 6)
support this ﬁnding. The matrix and the Widmanstätten Cu-rich
precipitates have the similar lattice constant of 3.58 Å. The habit
direction of Widmanstätten precipitation is 〈0 1 2〉. Notably, spheri-
cal nano-precipitates with an ordered L12 structure disperse in the
matrix and Cu-rich needles. Those in the former have a size around
10–15 nm and those in the latter have a size of around 5–10 nm.
This result is consistent with previous observations [6].
Fig. 5 compares the X-ray diffraction patterns of different rolling
reductions. The peak intensity of the FCC phase decreases signiﬁ-
cantly as the rolling reduction increases. The intensity of the (1 1 1)

peak in the sample with the 50%-reduction is less than 100 cps.
Moreover, the BCC diffraction peaks disappear after 30% reduction.
These facts demonstrate that lattice distortion and thus the diffuse
scattering of X-rays become more severe as the duration of cold
working is increased. The disappearance of BCC peaks is caused by
the smallness of the volume fraction of the BCC phase, whose peaks
are therefore easily hidden by diffusion scattering. The low diffrac-
tion intensity, exhibited by the sample with 0%-reduction (or the
as-homogenized-FC sample), is just a common phenomenon of all
previous high-entropy alloys. A theoretical explanation involves the
diffusion scattering caused by lattice distortion that is induced by
the presence of atoms of various elements and therefore of various
sizes [19].
Fig. 6 shows TEM microstructure of the Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi alloy
after its thickness is reduced by 5% by cold rolling. Nanotwins are
formed in spaces among the needle-like Widmanstätten precipi-
tates in the FCC matrix. They have the typical twin plane {1 1 1}
and twinning direction 〈1 1 2〉, as seen in traditional FCC metals.
The strain caused by this twinning mechanism can be estimated
from the maximum tensile strain, 0.4, which is reached when a
single crystal is transformed into a twin [20]. Thus, the estimated
maximum strain for the 5%-rolled sample is about 0.1 since the
inter-twin spacing is about four times the twin width, as shown in
Fig. 6. This result is consistent with the smaller true strain 0.05
imposed by 5%-rolling, since plastic deformation might be non-
uniform in different grains.
Since slip bands contain many dislocations etch pits that are not
found in the etched microstructure and dislocation tangles are also
not found in TEM samples, mechanical twinning is believed to be
the main mechanism of plastic deformation in the present alloy.
Pure FCC metals may exhibit deformation twinning only at very
low temperatures and a normal strain rate, as does Cu at 4.2 K, but
many highly alloyed FCC metals exhibit considerable deformation
twinning at room temperature, such as brass and bronze [20]. The
explanation is that their stacking fault energy declines as the con-
centration of solutes increases due to the Suzuki interaction and
thus the critical stress needed to nucleate twin decreases accord-
ingly. Following the same interaction, the present alloy contains
an extremely large amount of solutes, and the stacking fault energy
must be even lower. (In fact, all atoms in the present alloy are solutes
in the matrix.) Mechanical twinning is expected to be the preferred
mode for deformation.

precipitates, and sluggish diffusion importantly affect its deforma-
tion and annealing behaviors. Observed phenomena and related
mechanisms are as follows,
(1) Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi alloy has a simple dendritic structure that con-
sists of an FCC dendrite and a Cu-rich FCC interdendrite with a
similar lattice constant in the as-cast state.
(2) The BCC phase precipitated between the dendrite and the inter-
dendrite regions, and Widmanstätten needle-like precipitates
of the Cu-rich phase formed in the dendrite during furnace
cooling after homogenization.
(3) A signiﬁcant work hardening occurred during forging even at
900 ◦C. This low dynamic recovery at 900 ◦C may be attributable
to the large solution hardening, low stacking fault energy and
low equilibrium concentration of vacancies.
(4) Cold rolling with 50% reduction of thickness increased hard-
ness by 60% from that of the homogenized-FC state. Its
deformation and hardening mechanisms are unique with
nanotwinning deformation and increased nanotwin density,
respectively.
(5) Nanotwinning occurs in the early stage of deformation
because of low stacking fault energy and high matrix
strength. The former is related to the Suzuki interaction
in the whole-solute matrix. The latter is attributable to
solution hardening and the strengthening of Widmanstätten
precipitates.
(6) The work-hardening effect was eliminated by full annealing
at 900 ◦C for 5 h. The recovery and recrystallization proceeded
more slowly than those of traditional alloys with similar melting
points.
(7) The low recrystallization rate is mainly due to the low twin
boundary energy and thus the low driving force for recrys-
tallization. The sluggish diffusion of atoms and vacancies also
plays an important role since recrystallization involves grain
boundary migration.

investigating the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena in alloy
systems with multi-principal elements in equal or near equal mole
ratios.
This study reports the preparation of a series of HEA pow-
ders of Cu–Ni–Al–Co–Cr–Fe–Ti prepared byMA and then thermally
annealed. This approach reveals the thermodynamic and kinetic
aspects of HEApowders through structural evolution fromelemen-
tal materials to amorphous phases and then to equilibrium phases.
For comparison, HEA cast bulks with same compositions as the MA
alloys were also prepared by arc melting. The differences between
the constituent phases of the cast bulks and annealed powders can
be useful to reveal the deviation of the cast structure from equilib-
rium structure.
2. Experimental
Four MA specimens, including quaternary Cu0.5NiAlCo, quinary Cu0.5NiAlCoCr,
senary Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFe, and septenary Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFeTi alloys (all expressed in
molar ratio), were prepared. Table 1 lists the nominal compositions of experimental
alloys. Elemental powders of Cu, Ni, Al, Co, Cr, Fe, and Ti with purities higher than
99.9%were used as rawmaterials. Their average particle sizeswere 5, 10, 25, 5, 5, 40,
and 30m, respectively. In the ﬁrst step of the MA process, the various elemental
powders were charged into hardened SKD 11 (JIS G4404 SKD-11) steel vials with a
hardness of RC 50 together with chrome steel balls (6.4mm in diameter and 10:1
in ball-to-powder weight ratio) and sealed under an argon atmosphere. Milling was
then performed in an SPEX 8000 vibration ball-milling machine for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12,
24, 36, 48, and 60h, respectively. To avoid a signiﬁcant increase in temperature,
the steel vials were cooled by a continuous air ﬂow, and an interval of 10min was
applied after each milling cycle of 30min. The amorphous MA powders obtained
after a prolonged milling time were further sealed in quartz tubes, evacuated to
0.01 atm, and then annealed at designated high temperatures for 30min.
For comparison, cast bulks with the same compositions as the MA alloys were
prepared by arc melting raw elements of at least 99% purity. The melt was then
solidiﬁed in a Cu crucible under a vacuum of 0.01 atm [3]. The bulk samples were
cut, ground, polished, and etched by aqua regia for microstructure observations.
Thermal analysiswas performedwith a differential thermal analyzer (DTA, Pyris
Diamond) from room temperature to 1300 ◦C at a heating rate of 10 ◦Cmin−1 in an
argon atmosphere. An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku ME510-FM2) with Cu K
radiation (1.5405Å) was carried out to analyze the crystal structures of the MA
powders and cast bulks at a scanning speed of 4◦ min−1. A scanning electron micro-
scope (SEM, JEOL-5410) with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was used to
observe microstructures and measure the composition of alloy powders. The amor-
phous powders were also investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM,
JEOL-2010) for conﬁrmation.
3. Results
3.1. Phase evolution of elemental powders during MA
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the quaternary Cu0.5NiAlCo
MA powders with different milling times. In the early stages of
milling, the diffraction peaks of Cu and Ni ﬁrst merge and broaden,
implying the formation of a FCC Cu–Ni solution, as explained in
previous research [19,20]. At the same time, the peaks of Al and
Co decrease in intensity and disappear in sequence, implying the
dissolution of Al and Co into the Cu–Ni solution phase. This dis-
solution is caused by severe deformation enhanced diffusion even
at low milling temperatures. With prolonged milling, the Cu–Ni
solution diffraction peaks shift to a lower angle, indicating lattice
expansion due to the dissolution of the larger element, Al [19,20].
After milling for 6h, only one set of peaks of the FCC solid solution

times.
appears, with no peaks of residual pure elements. The grain size
(d) of the FCC solution phase calculated by the Scherrer equation
[21] ranges from 4.4 to 5.5nm at milling times ranging from 6 to
48h. After milling for 60h, the MA powders become amorphous,
indicating the complete deconstruction of crystalline structures
by severe mechanical deformation. Similar phase evolution occurs
in the other three MA powders as well. Fig. 2 plots the XRD pat-
terns of each alloy, which show the amorphous structures obtained
after extended milling. However, there are still some small protru-
sions in the patterns besides the broad amorphous peak, indicating
that a small amount of nanocrystalline phase exists in the powder
samples. The crystalline phase is considered to be from those par-
ticles with a partial amorphous structure. TEM analysis conﬁrms
the presence of these amorphous structures. Fig. 3 shows a typical
TEM image of Cu0.5NiAlCoCr amorphous powders. The bright ﬁeld
image in Fig. 3(a) exhibits no structural contrast but only thickness
contrast,which corresponds to thediffractionpattern showingonly
amorphous diffuse ring. By choosing a part of the diffuse ring, the
dark ﬁeld image shows a bright matrix dispersed with many bright
spots which are smaller than 1nm, as Fig. 3(b) shows. Although
some spots larger than 1nm still exist, asmarked by the circles, the

temperatures, but behave much like traditional amorphous alloys
formed under rapid solidiﬁcation with a cooling rate higher than
103 K s−1 [29,30]. Moreover, the XRD pattern of cast Cu0.5NiAlCo
bulk alloy in Fig. 5 shows that the peaks of dominant BCC and
minor FCC structures are apparent. This result indicates that the
phases seen in the cast state can be regarded as equilibrium phases
obtained by annealing amorphous MA powders. The deviation
fromequilibrium is small for the present alloy during solidiﬁcation.
3.2.2. Cu0.5NiAlCoCr quinary alloy
Fig. 6 shows the DTA curve of amorphous MA Cu0.5NiAlCoCr
powders. This ﬁgure shows exothermic peaks at 100, 245, 568, and
740 ◦C, and a sharp endothermic peak at 1230 ◦C as the alloy melt-
ing point. For comparison, Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns of MA
Cu0.5NiAlCo powders after annealing at 500, 600, and 900 ◦C. Simi-
lar to thequaternaryCu0.5NiAlCoalloy, theBCCphasewithveryﬁne
grains of about 6.9nm formed after annealing at 500 ◦C implies that
the exothermic peaks at 100 and 245 ◦C indicate the recovery of the
amorphous phase and the crystallization of the BCC phase, respec-
tively. The appearance of the FCC phase after annealing at 600 ◦C
indicates that the exothermic peak at 568 ◦C is due to the precipi-
tation of the FCC phase. The formation of the NiCoCr-rich  phase
(lattice constants a=0.874nm and c=0.459nm) similar to a binary

CoCr phase (tetragonal structure, lattice constants a=0.885nmand
c=0.471nm) after annealing at 900 ◦C demonstrates that the broad
exothermic peak at 740 ◦C in theDTA curve is generated by the pre-
cipitationof thephase andassociatedwith the grain growthof the
BCC and FCC phases. Similarly, the amorphous Cu0.5NiAlCoCr phase
does not show a glass transition temperature before the crystal-
lization temperature, indicating the traditional amorphous alloys
formedunder rapid solidiﬁcation. For comparison, Fig. 7 also shows
the XRD pattern of cast Cu0.5NiAlCoCr bulk alloy. Unlike annealed
powders, the cast bulk alloy is composed of only BCC and FCC
phases without the existence of the  phase. This indicates a non-
equilibrium state of the solidiﬁed structure, i.e., inhibition of the 
phase during solidiﬁcation. The  phase is the equilibrium phase,
as the XRD analysis in Fig. 7 shows that annealing on the cast alloy
at 1000 ◦C for 24h results in its formation.
3.2.3. Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFe senary alloy
Fig. 8 shows the DTA curve of amorphous MA Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFe
powders. This ﬁgure shows exothermic peaks at 100, 273, 546,
and 751 ◦C, with an endothermic peak at 1255 ◦C indicating alloy
melting. In addition, Fig. 9 shows the XRD patterns of the MA
Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFe powders after annealing at 500, 600, and 900 ◦C.
Similarly, the exothermic peaks denote the recovery of amorphous
powders, the crystallization to the BCC phase (grain size 13.8nm),
the precipitation of the FCC phase, and the grain growth of both

whereXi is themole fraction of element i in the alloy. Thus, themix-
ing entropies are 4.5, 5.3, 5.9, and 6.4 kJmole−1 for the Cu0.5NiAlCo,
Cu0.5NiAlCoCr, Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFe, and Cu0.5NiAlCoCrFeTi alloys,
respectively. As the enthalpy values are relatively small and the
entropy values are relatively high, the present alloys favor attrac-
tive interactions among the constituent atoms to form crystalline
nuclei of solid solution phase. This also means the present alloys
have poorer glass forming abilities, thus requiring a prolonged
milling time up to 60h to achieve full amorphization. In con-
trast, bulk amorphous alloys, which have larger negative mixing
enthalpies and smaller mixing entropies, can easily achieve an
amorphous structure within a much shorter milling time, e.g. less
than 10h.
Egami and Inoue proposed two main criteria for the amor-
phization of alloys, respectively. For glass formation during rapid
quenching, mechanical alloying, and solid-state reactions or inter-
diffusion, Egami’s theory predicts a critical volume strain of 5.54%
for binary alloys. This leads to the local topological instability of
crystalline structures, and thus the formation of amorphous struc-
ture. The minimum solute concentration for glass formation for
binary alloys can be further derived as the following equation
[35–37]:
CminS
|S − M |
M
= 0.1 (2)
where S and M are the volumes of solute and matrix atoms,
respectively. In considering a binary equimolar alloy, the small-
est atomic-size difference for forming a glass phase is 6.3%. The
other criterion, proposed by Inoue, emphasizes three empirical
rules for forming bulk metallic glass [25,29]: (1) more than three
components, (2) differences in atomic sizes larger than 12% among
the large, medium, and small components, and (3) high negative
mixing enthalpies. These rules effectively inhibit the nucleation of
crystalline phases from liquids, even at a low cooling rate.
Since the solid-state transformations in present MA processes
differ from the liquid-to-solid reactions in forming bulk amorphous
alloys, Egami’s criterion for the topological instability of crystalline
structure is more appropriate for discussing the amorphization of
MAalloys. Table3 lists theatomic radii of all theelements employed
in the present alloys. This table shows that Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, and Fe
have similar atomic sizes between 1.25 and 1.28Å, and Al and Ti
also have similar sizes, though larger than the former. Thus, each
alloy can be regarded as a pseudo-binary alloy with two levels of
atomic size, in which Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, and Fe can be treated as sol-
vents (M) while Al and Ti can be treated as solutes (S). Table 4
lists the compositions, average atomic sizes of solvent (RM) and

solute (RS) atoms, and predicted minimum concentration of solute
atoms fromEq. (1) for the pseudo-binary alloys. These results show
that the pseudo-solute atom concentration satisﬁes the minimum
concentration requirement, except for the senary alloy, for which
the solute concentration (18%) is lower than 23%. This suggests
that Egami’s criterion for the topological instability of crystalline
structures is a conservative measure of the amorphization of the
present MA alloys. The amorphization of the senary alloy indi-
cates that the criterion could be even lower for the present MA
alloys. This can be attributable to two more enhancing factors: (1)
high-energy milling, which might introduce excess vacancies and
distortion, and (2) atomic-size differences among elements with
the same atomic-size level. For the ﬁrst factor, Massobrio et al.
showed that amorphization can be triggered in binary crystalline
alloys by the percolation of distortions due to chemical disorders,
such as solid-state crystalline-to-amorphous transformations, irra-
diation, interdiffusion annealing, and mechanical alloying. Their
molecular dynamic simulation proved that the percolation thresh-
old is a universal quantity, amounting to dV/V∼17–20% [38,39].
Massobrio et al. hence demonstrated thatmore distortion imposed
on the crystalline structure bymechanicalmilling can complement
the insufﬁcient condition for the amorphization and thus achieve
an amorphous structure. Fig. 12 illustrates the evolution of the
metastable phase as the mechanical milling time increases. The
crystalline solid solution phase forms ﬁrst, but as the milling time
increases, severe deformation causes more defects and distortion,
ﬁnally resulting in a fully amorphous structure.
4.2. Nonexistence of glass transition temperatures of amorphous
MA structures
The nonexistence of the glass transition temperature in the
amorphous structures of the presentMA alloys is due to their small
atomic-size differences. Tables 3 and 4 show that the atomic-size

imposing more defects and lattice distortion into the structure

to meet Egami’s criterion.

cial to predicting the existence of glass transition, and thus the
temperature range of supercooled liquids.
