The Optimal Design of a New type Ridge-wave 
Circular Ultrasonic Motor 
Tai-Ho Yu 
Abstract—This paper proposes a strategy to improve the performance of ridge wave ultrasonic 
motors (RW-USM) in their infancy. In general, USMs are operated in the vicinity of a resonant 
frequency of a specific vibration mode, which must be well separated from the resonant frequencies of 
other modes. In the current prototype, unexpected disturbance occurred at the instant of switching 
on/off or changing the direction of the motor, both in simulations and through actual experimental 
observation. The simulated results indicated that good modal separation could be achieved if the height 
of the upper base beneath the piezoelectric tube was selected correctly. The experimental results show 
that the transient response in the revolution speed is quicker and more stable in this new design. The 
maximum output torque was increased by 8% when the unexpected modes were separated from 
excitation of the RW-USM.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Ultrasonic motors (USM) are also referred to as piezoelectric motors. By utilizing the mechanical vibration in 
the ultrasonic frequency range in conjunction with the frictional forces between the rotor and the stator, the 
rotor is driven rotationally in a special energy transform actuator. Ultrasonic motors provide superior 
performance compared with electromagnetic motors, by offering high torque at low rotational speed, a simple 
structure, freedom from electromagnetic interference and high controllability. 
The first ultrasonic motor was first discovered in the early 1960s, but until 1980, they were viewd as 
something of a revolutionary idea. Toshiiku and Sashida [1-2] proposed the concept of a ring-type 
traveling-wave ultrasonic motor, which proved to be a better design for the ultrasonic motors that followed. In 
1992, Aoyagi et al [3] combined a longitudinal wave and a bending wave to produce a mode coupling 
vibration, and developed a mono-phase driving rotary ultrasonic motor. In 2002, Koc et al [4] proposed a

solution to Eq. (2) results in the dispersion equation or frequency equation as follows

The resonant modes of flexural waves can be calculated if both the angular frequency fπ=ω 2  and the 
circumferential wave number Rnk =  in Eq. (3) are determined. The term R is the radius of the circular 
ridge. 
III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The motor stator shown in Fig. 1 comprised a stainless teethridge, a piezoelectric tube and a two-segment 
stepped metal base. The inner diameter, outer diameter, and height of the piezoelectric tube were 21.9 mm, 
25.9 mm, and 12.5 mm, respectively. The piezoelectric tube made of PZT-4 was supplied by Eleceram Inc., 
Taiwan. It had the following charge coefficients: d33 = 289 pC/N, d31 = -123 pC/N. The 36 tooth’s teethridge 
and two-segment stepped base were made of stainless steel, and all components were adhered together. 
The RW-USM was driven by the specific flexural mode. All of the flexural modes are represented as F(m, n), 
where m and n are the numbers of the radial modes and circumference modes on the circular stator. The elastic 
ridge waves traveling along the circumference of the motor stator were produced through the interference of 
two flexural vibrations of the same modes. The prototype motor fabricated for performance test was designed 
to be driven by the mode F(1, 4) traveling circumferentially around the ridge. The outer periphery was four 
times the wavelength. The electrodes were placed over one half of each wavelength around the circumference 
of the piezoelectric tube, which was radially polarized through the thickness on the walls from the inside to 
the outside. 
Numerical calculation for vibration of the motor stator was carried out by an FEM commercial code ANSYS 
10.0 (ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA). Fig. 2 shows two resonant modes for the upper base height H = 0. 
The flexural mode F(1, 4) had a resonant frequency fr = 36.199. There was only a 543 Hz difference between 
F(1,4) and the torsional mode T(1, 0) of its closest neighbor, whose resonant frequency was fr = 36.742 kHz. 
Both modes could be simultaneously stimulated and interfere with each other. In this manner, unexpected 
disturbance was induced at the instant of switching on/off or changing direction of the motor.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUTIONS 
The RW-USM is a motor driven by traveling ridge wave in conjunction with the frictional forces between the 
rotor and the stator. The confirmation of the resonant mode and its corresponding resonant frequency are 
important in the motor’s infancy. In the present prototype, the motor stator composes a stainless teethridge, a 
piezoelectric tube and a stainless base. The piezoelectric tube was made by powder metallurgy method, and 
therefore the structure was unsuitable for alteration by secondary machining processes. The supplier of 
piezoelectric tubes was unable to satisfy our design needs. For this reason, we adjusted the upper segment 
height H of the stainless base to achieve acceptable modal separation. The driving frequency of the prototype 
RW-USM was in the vicinity of the resonant frequency of mode F(1, 4), which had to be separated distinctly 
from other neighboring resonant modes. An excellent modal separation guarantees that the other modes do not 
participate of interfere with the operating mode of interest. 
Regardless of the longitudinal modes, torsional modes or flexural modes, the resonant frequency decreased 
with an increase the base height (H) of the upper segment. The fundamental flexural modes with axial mode 
number m = 1 were only slightly influenced by an increase in H. Because the energy carried by the 
fundamental flexural waves was concentrated in the area near the tip of the ridge, increasing the base height 
did not significantly alter the resonant frequencies. The wave energy was widely distributed over the top and 
beneath the stator for those modes having axial mode number greater than one. Damage induced through the 
generation of heat would occur within the piezoelectric tube in the stator, if wave energy spread underneath. 
For this reason, the fundamental mode was selected to drive the present RW-USM. 
The maximum revolution speeds are 104.62 rpm and 84.77 rpm for H = 12.5 mm and 0, respectively. The 
former has faster rotary speed than the latter. The maximum torque is 0.76 kg-mm for H = 12.5 mm. The 
value is greater than 0.70 kg-mm for H = 0. The average rise time of the transient response decreases from 89 
ms to 45 ms if H increases from 0 to 12.5 mm. The maximum output power increases from 31.87 mW to 
42.29 mW. These results indicate that the performance and dynamic response of the RW-USM are 
successfully improved by increasing the upper segment base height H of the stator to achieve excellent modal 
separation. 
The experimental result indicated the motor operates as expected. However, the output torque is still too small.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The motor stator shown in Fig. 1 comprised a stainless 
teethridge, a piezoelectric tube and a two-segment stepped 
metal base. The inner diameter, outer diameter, and height of 
the piezoelectric tube were 21.9 mm, 25.9 mm, and 12.5 mm, 
respectively. The piezoelectric tube made of PZT-4 was

The RW-USM was driven by the specific flexural mode. 
All of the flexural modes are represented as F(m, n), where m

unexpected disturbance was induced at the instant of switching 
on/off or changing direction of the motor. 
We increased the base height (H) upper segment from 0 to 
20 mm in 2.5 mm increments and repeated modal analysis by 
ANSYS to identify the structure with the optimal modal 
separation. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 3. It was 
found that the best model separation could be achieved when H 
= 12.5 mm. The mode F(1, 4) was separated from the other 
neighboring modes by at least 4 kHz. 
In the case where H = 0, the resonant frequency of mode 
T(1, 0) was very close to that of mode F(1, 4). In the new 
design with H = 12.5 mm, the resonant frequency of T(1, 0) 
was reduced to 26.738 kHz, which was far from the new 
resonant frequency of F(1, 4). Instead of T(1, 0), F(2, 1) 
became the mode closest to F(1, 4). Fig. 4 shows the resonant 
modes of F(1, 4) and F(2, 1) for the stator with H = 12.5 mm. 
The difference between the resonant frequencies of F(1, 4) (fr = 
34.008 kHz) and F(2, 1) (fr = 38.308 kHz) was 4.3 kHz.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUTIONS 
The RW-USM is a motor driven by traveling ridge wave in 
conjunction with the frictional forces between the rotor and the 
stator. The confirmation of the resonant mode and its 
corresponding resonant frequency are important in the motor’s 
infancy. In the present prototype, the motor stator composes a 
stainless teethridge, a piezoelectric tube and a stainless base. 
The piezoelectric tube was made by powder metallurgy method, 
and therefore the structure was unsuitable for alteration by 
secondary machining processes. The supplier of piezoelectric 
tubes was unable to satisfy our design needs. For this reason, 
we adjusted the upper segment height H of the stainless base to 
achieve acceptable modal separation. The driving frequency of 
the prototype RW-USM was in the vicinity of the resonant 
frequency of mode F(1, 4), which had to be separated distinctly 
from other neighboring resonant modes. An excellent modal 
separation guarantees that the other modes do not participate of 
interfere with the operating mode of interest. 
Regardless of the longitudinal modes, torsional modes or 
flexural modes, the resonant frequency decreased with an 
increase the base height (H) of the upper segment. The 
fundamental flexural modes with axial mode number m = 1 
were only slightly influenced by an increase in H. Because the 
energy carried by the fundamental flexural waves was 
concentrated in the area near the tip of the ridge, increasing the 
base height did not significantly alter the resonant frequencies. 
The wave energy was widely distributed over the top and 
beneath the stator for those modes having axial mode number 
greater than one. Damage induced through the generation of 
heat would occur within the piezoelectric tube in the stator, if 
wave energy spread underneath. For this reason, the 
fundamental mode was selected to drive the present RW-USM. 
The maximum revolution speeds are 104.62 rpm and 84.77 
rpm for H = 12.5 mm and 0, respectively. The former has faster 
rotary speed than the latter. The maximum torque is 0.76 
kg-mm for H = 12.5 mm. The value is greater than 0.70 kg-mm 
for H = 0. The average rise time of the transient response 
decreases from 89 ms to 45 ms if H increases from 0 to 12.5 
mm. The maximum output power increases from 31.87 mW to 
42.29 mW. These results indicate that the performance and 
dynamic response of the RW-USM are successfully improved 
by increasing the upper segment base height H of the stator to 
achieve excellent modal separation. 
The experimental result indicated the motor operates as 
expected. However, the output torque is still too small. From 
the viewpoint of the performance of the flexural vibrator, the 
output torque can be increased by increasing the pre-load and 
the driving voltage of the WW-USM. To reduce the wasted 
power and improve the overall performance of the actuator, a 
more suitable friction material between the rotor and the stator 
should be selected. This will be a significant future challenge 
for the WW-USM, as in other types of USMs.
