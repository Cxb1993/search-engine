英文摘要
Based on the first-year’s design (circle/ellipse critical-cornering cruise controller
design and car-following vision-based fuzzy controller design), we further propose: (1)
a vision-based human-in-the-loop (HITL) automatic car-following (ACC) and
intelligent cruise control (ICC) switching system. Human-driver and traffic network
are integrated into supervisory control design to achieve a hierarchical HITL
switching control structure. The proposed system has been implemented in Taiwan
iTS-1 for real road test. (2) TS-fuzzy-based integrated longitudinal and lateral coupled
automatic lane-change controller system. The fuzzy technique is used to design an
intelligent optimal lane-change controller. We demonstrate the system via CarSim
environment.
Keywords: Optimal lane-change control, hierarchical human-in-the-loop control,
inputs-coupled effect.
4technologies. Recently, some researchers developed coordinated longitudinal- and lateral-control
technologies to deal with nonlinearity and coupling-effect such that a vehicle system can drive safely in
various driving environment.
Based on the first year’s research, we propose (1) a human-in-the-loop hierarchical control structure to
achieve integrated intelligent lane-keeping and adaptive car-following. The special modifications to the
automation system are to ensure safety and smooth operation with workload reduction for the human
driver. Experimental results in real road environments document the performance of the overall system
integration extended to the capability of HITL design; (2) a omni-direction T-S fuzzy-based optimal
automotive lane-change control system to achieve multi-objectives following (vehicle speed and lateral
offset). A nonlinear T-S fuzzy-model is used to describe the nonlinear and coupled vehicle dynamics. The
proposed design scheme is demonstrated via CarSim; a professional vehicle software which can mimic
the vehicle dynamic behavior almost perfectly.
（二）研究方法與結果討論
1. Human-in-the-loop Hierarchical ACC/ICC Switch 影像系統
In this year, human-driver behavior is integrated into the 1st-year proposed car-following system to
achieve the following human-in-the-loop longitudinal automation system,
Figure 1.
Supervisory-control provides regulation-control the operation-mode decision and desired
velocity-command for executing velocity-tracking. We further integrate traffic-network
information into longitudinal automation system to obtain a hierarchical-control autonomy
structure,
6system.
Figure 3.
A target is available (valid target, target-vehicle) when it is in the feasible range of sensors (lacer
radar) and its velocity is less than that of the subject-vehicle. Intelligent-cruise-control (ICC)
mode is to automatically follow a preceding-vehicle under a driver’s supervision. The driver will
recognize possible emergency-conditions, set and issue a desired steering-velocity commend to
regulation-control. Adaptive- cruise-control (ACC) mode is to adapt the steering-velocity for
keeping a safety distance with the target-vehicle. Supervisory-control will communicate with
infrastructure systems, response to roadway-control commands, and use vehicle-to-vehicle (v-v)
communication to reach the preceding vehicle. Based on the desired headway-time command,
supervisory-control processes all available inputs and transmits appropriate velocity-command for
executing regulation-control to guarantee collision-free car-following. Notice that the transition
from automatic- to manual-control is on safe-consideration instead of on drivers’decision.
Platoon-control mode is to improve traffic-capacity in safety-driving environment. The
distinction between platoon-control mode and ACC mode is on the value of the headway distance.
The headway distance of platoon-control mode is fixed, while that of ACC mode is adapted to
safety headway-time strategy. And, it is smaller than that of ACC. Road-control system provides
supervisory-control system the intra-platoon distance to estimate the desired headway-distance,
which is then transmitted to regulation-control.
For reducing driver-workload, the logic selection in Fig.~3 will automatically detect road
environment and determine the operation mode. While car-following scenario is activated,
supervisory-control select the operation mode automatically. Once the valid-target is detected,
supervisory-control can choose ACC- or platoon-control mode if roadway-control is available.

We further reform the quadratic fuzzy tracking problem with regard to
system-states into a quadratic fuzzy control problem with regard to error-states.

converted to a regulation problem. In other words, we have a noise-included fuzzy

CarSim is a vehicle-platoon software, which can mimic the dynamic behavior of
vehicles almost perfectly. The included vehicle models are fully nonlinear and are
described as differential equations with over 70 dynamic states. Now we wish to steer
our vehicle to the neighborhood lane and then switch back to the original lane again.
The desired trajectory is, in fact, not physically marked on highways. It is a virtual
desired trajectory (VDT), determined on the basis of both passengers’ride comfort
and transition time. We regard the VDT as a reference for lateral offset. The design
purpose is to follow the VDT route at a desired velocity. Here, we adopt a smooth
double-lane-change trajectory in CarSim as our desired route, shown in Fig. 8. The
desired velocity is set at 25 m/s (90 km/h). We further regard the VDT route as an
imaginary road centerline. Therefore, the double-lane-change vehicle dynamics can
be described as (4).
The animation scenario for double lane-change steering system is shown in Fig. 9.
Figure 10 shows the perfect tracking for longitudinal velocity and VDT route.

(三) 計畫成果自評
An automated lane-change driving control technology for vehicles to achieve
smooth multi-objectives following (vehicle speed and lateral offset) is proposed. We
also propose a hierarchical human-in-the-loop structure; an adaptive sensory
processor, a supervisory control and a regulation control is proposed for ACC/ICC
switching system. The overall system is successfully implemented on a passenger
vehicle tested in real road environments. Parts of the results has been accepted for
