ABSTRACT 
Hydraulic pump-controlled servo systems 
have high energy-efficiency. However, the 
conventional pump-controlled systems, which 
are altered by displacement via variable 
displacement pumps, have lower response. This 
research aims to investigate the servo 
performance of the high response 
electro-hydraulic pump-controlled systems 
driven by an AC servo motor with variable 
rotational speed. Instead of internal gear pumps 
discussed in the references, a constant 
displacement axial piston pump, which has 
better performance and efficiency than the 
internal gear pump, is used in this research. 
Thus, the new hydraulic pump-controlled 
system with an AC motor servo and a constant 
displacement axial piston pump is investigated 
for force control in hydraulic injection moulding 
machines (HIMMs). For that, this research also 
develops the control strategy, sign-distance 
fuzzy sliding mode control (SD-FSMC). The 
SD-FSMC can simplify the fuzzy rule base 
through the sliding surface. The developed high 
response variable rotational speed 
pump-controlled systems controlled by 
SD-FSMC are implemented and verified 
experimentally for force control on different 
force targets and force tracking control with sine 
wave input. 
Keywords: Hydraulic injection moulding 
machines, electro-hydraulic pump-controlled 
system, AC servo motor, axial piston pump, 
force control, signed-distance fuzzy sliding 
mode control. 
1. Introduction 
Hydraulic servo driving systems have the 
advantages of high power-weight ratio, high 
 2
control targets. 
 
2. Layout of Experimental System 
The test rig in this work can be divided into 
three subsystems, including the hydraulic servo 
cylinder system, the hydraulic power supply 
system and the PC-based control system, as 
shown in Fig.1. The specifications of the main 
components are listed in Table 1. The hydraulic 
servo cylinder system contains a symmetrical 
cylinder fitted with a linear encoder with the 
resolution of 0,1 µm. The hydraulic power 
supply system, which consists of a swash plate 
axial piston pump with constant displacement of 
12 ml/rev and is driven by an AC servo motor of 
7.0 kW, adjusts the supply volume flow by the 
rotational speed controlled by the AC servo 
motor. The output control signals in RPM of the 
AC servo motor are given from the PC-based 
controller with the sampling time of 5 ms via 
D/A converters and enlarged by a servo 
amplifier. The force signal is measured by the 
load cell and fed back to the PC-based controller. 
Therefore, the overall system contains an 
electro-hydraulic pump-controlled system 
controlled by variable rotational speed AC servo 
motor. Besides, the disturbance system, 
including a disturbance cylinder, two relief 
valves and a gear pump, is used here to generate 
external disturbance force by closing the two 
relief valves DRV1 and DRV2 for the different 
loading conditions of experiments. 
3. Signed-Distance Fuzzy Sliding Mode 
Control  
Conventional fuzzy control theory contains 
fuzzification, fuzzy rule base, fuzzy inference 
and defuzzification. In many fuzzy control 
systems, the fuzzy rule base depends on control 
error  and control error rate  that 
complicate the fuzzy inference rules and the 
membership functions. In order to reduce the 
fuzzy rules in fuzzy controller, fuzzy sliding 
mode controllers (FSMC) that combine fuzzy 
control theory with sliding mode control were 
quite developed [15]. In this paper, 
signed-distance fuzzy sliding mode control 
(SD-FSMC) [18] is used to design the hydraulic 
servo controller. In most traditional fuzzy 
sliding mode control, the 2-dimensional rule 
table has the skew-symmetric property, and the 
absolute magnitude of the control input is 
proportional to the distance from the main 
diagonal line on the phase plane. Therefore, the 
signed-distance d
e e&
s is introduced, which is the 
distance from the actual state to the sliding 
surface: 
ZEROee =+⋅= )( &ασ                  (1) 
Note that the control inputs above and 
below the sliding surface have opposite signs. 
Let A( , ) be the intersection point of the 
switching line and the line perpendicular to the 
switching line from an operating point B( , ), 
as illustrated in Fig.2. Thus, define the signed- 
distance d
e e&

Since the sign of the control input  is 
negative for 
du
0>σ  and positive for 0<σ  
and its absolute magnitude is proportional to the 
distance ds from the line 0=σ , it can be 
concluded that: 
sd du −∝                         (4) 
Thus, the fuzzy rule table can be 
established on an one-dimensional space of ds 
instead of two-dimensional space of the ee &−  
plane. That is, the control input can be 
determined only by ds instead of error  and 
error rate .

By the SD-FSMC, the number of fuzzy 
rules can be considerably reduced and easily 
tuned. The sliding surface is divided into 7

only low power is needed and the energy 
efficiency is high. Therefore, the hydraulic 
pump-controlled servo system realizes the 
performance of high response and high energy 
efficiency.  The performances of the system 
under the three different test conditions are 
summarized in Table 4.

mplitude of 4000 kgf and the frequency of 
0.1 Hz is implemented to evaluate the tracking 
performance of the hydraulic pump-controlled 
servo system. Fig.8 indicates that the phase lag 
is about 0.2 seconds over the full cycles except 
on the dead band of the cylinder motion, at that 
time hysteresis exists when the hydraulic 
cylinder changes moving direction. On the other 
hand, only a little deterioration at the peak of 
sine wave force output when the AC servo 
motor changes rotation direction. The 
experimental results show that the tracking 
performance is acceptable over the full cycles.
