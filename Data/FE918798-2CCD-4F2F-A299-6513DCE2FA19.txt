The purpose of this investigation aims to combine two past investigation results: (1) 
SLG: an interactive allocation tool for architectural space layout; (2) CBA: an online case 
library based on rational database technology. This investigation aims to integrate SLG into 
CBA case library, thereby serving as a tool for encoding, representation and retrieval of the 
plane views of architectural design cases. Via SLG’s interactive and instinct manipulations, 
CBA case library can therefore be provided with an interactive encoding and indexing tool 
named STR: spatial topology retrieval. STR can assist encoding spatial topologies within a 
plane view of an architectural design case, and retrieve cases similar to spatial topology by 
searching and mapping functions of the CBA database. Finally, via the assistance of STR, 
CBA may be able to explicit the implicit knowledge within an architectural plane view, and 
help user to recognize spatial topology within a plane view.  
Concrete results of this study are as follows: 
1. Analysis of spatial topology code: Through literature review to collect necessary 
topology for house design, including the “adjacency”, “connected” and “seat to,” 
etc., and to establish coding means. 
2. Collecting and encoding cases of local residential types: Collection of common 
house types in Taiwan, such as “row house”, “condominium” and “villa,” then input 
the basic features and their plans of 30 to 50 cases of every type into CBA for 
testing and experiments of STR. 
3. Implementation of STR: According the codes of spatial topology to program STR 
system and to integrate it into CBA in order to facilitate encoding spatial topology 
and retrieval functions of case. 
4. Preliminary tests: Providing STR to teachers and assistant for preliminary testing of 
spatial topology encoding and retrieval, in order to detect system vulnerabilities as 
the basis for the next phase of improvement. 
Through the implementation of STR, the contribution of this project is to integrate the 
visual design language and graphic user interface in order to solve the problems for encoding, 
expression and acquisition of implicit “space topology” knowledge of a case library. 
Meanwhile, by providing the operating procedure of “spatial topology knowledge,” this 
project displays a different approach form the current BIM technology, and a digital tool 
which more meets design logical thinking and design procedures of an architect. The results 
of this project should be able to occur role model and inspire current CAAD software, which 
over-emphasis on relationships of solid geometry for the application of building construction. 
Second, for architectural design education, CAAD can no longer just a drawing, modeling 
techniques and perspective painting tools only, indeed can be used as a utility for design 
teaching, expression of design knowledge and design exploration.

design and performance analysis (Howell & Batchele, 2005). Consequently, those 
implementations all lack the topological information of the indoor and outdoor spaces, 
which is required for the early architectural design and performance analysis.  
The purpose of this paper aims to combine two previous investigation results: (1) Space 
Layout Game (SLG): a physical-based interactive allocation tool for the architectural space 
layout in the early design stage (Lin, 2005); (2) Open Case Study (OCS): an online case 
library with the rational database technology as an ontology-based authoring tool of the 
metadata of case features (Lin & Chiu, 2009). A visual tool named Spatial Topology 
Retrieval (STR) is developed to integrate SLG into OCS case library. Via Internet-ready 
visual interface and database connecting capabilities, STR thereby services OSC as a tool for 
modelling, representing, and retrieving the plane views of a design case. 
 
2. Approach for Modelling, Representation and Retrieval of Spatial Topology  
Modelling, representing and retrieving the spatial topology are critical to the 
investigation of the geographic information system (GIS), but are often overlooked by the 
recent CAAD researches. Early investigations involving case-based systems such as 
CADRE, FABEL, and SEED attempted to directly include spatial topology in their systems; 
however, due to the IT limitations in earlier times, those systems were either difficult to use 
or limited in terms of the function scope. Furthermore, earlier systems failed to link other 
existing case libraries to expand the indexing and retrieving capabilities of the case library. 
Many design theories, principles, and rules of the architectural design and performance 
analysis are expressed in terms of the topology relationship.  Common examples are space 
coordination, viewing sights, or circulation relationship. There are at least three approaches 
for modelling, representing and retrieving the spatial topology: (1) automatic, (2) BIM, and 
(3) content-based. 
 
2.1. AUTOMATIC APPROACH  
Design automation was one of the initial motivations to develop CAD and AI, and 
automated spatial layout was one of the first desired tasks. Many different methods and 
almost every AI algorithm for solving this problem have been proposed. Since the spatial 
topology is actually determined by the geometric information of spaces--such as the relevant 
positions and dimensions of spaces or components within the architectural layouts, it is 
possible to establish a tool for automatically recognizing, then indexing and retrieving the 
spatial topology from the spatial layouts. For example, algorithms were proposed for 
recognizing, then indexing and retrieving indoor furniture’s topological relation and their 
layouts from the existing architectural plans in FABEL (Coulon, 1995).  
The automatic approach is based on three criteria: (1) geometric information of the 
relevant spaces or physical components, (2) semantic attributes of the spaces or physical 
components for recognition, and (3) algorithms that can convert the geometric information 
and the topological relations to each other. Nevertheless, even modern BIM implementations 
usually fall short of the necessary geometric information of architectural spaces and the 
feasible algorithm for spatial topology. Let alone those old design cases without useful 
digital geometric and semantic information. Hence, even the automatic approach is practical, 
but how to extract the useful geometric information from the old cases and to integrate 
algorithms into a case library remains a critical problem. 
 
2.2. BIM APPROACH 
The geometric and semantic information is the key to the spatial topology, and many 
BIM implementations have modeled the essential information of building design objects. 
Therefore, one feasible approach is to extend the information models and necessary 
algorithms into the existing BIMs. To replenish BIM with spatial information, which 
obviously distinguishes the current BIM implementations from Eastman’s original intention, 
should be one reasonable means. For example, a space-syntax-based model is proposed to 
enhance the BIM capabilities for the early architectural design (Li, Lee & Choi, 2009).

by physical components of BIM, an alternative of automatic recognition by machines is to 
attach textual or other annotations with human efforts, such as the textual “tags” of image 
files on Flickr. However, simple textual annotations obviously cannot represent most of the 
implicit information in a floor plan, such as spatial topology. A visual interface for 
annotating graphic information such as spatial geometry and topology of the floor plan then 
becomes necessary in this situation.  
Another problem with extracting geometric space information from the image files is 
scale precision and correctness. Some basic image processing tools, such as scaling, rotating, 
and measuring, and manipulative skills, become necessary for a visual approach to improve 
the precision of geometric information. For example, an image file of a house floor plan may 
not be in appropriate scales. Assuming that the normal dimension of an interior door is 90cm 
wide, we can reproduce this image in the new scale. After simple adjustments, most of the 
image files of a floor plan can be used to annotate their spatial topology in STR. However, 
on account of API’s limited abilities in image processing, not all necessary per-processing of 
a floor plan image can be implemented in STR as of today. 
 
3.2. PHYSICAL-BASED VALIDATION FOR SPATIAL TOPOLOGY 
Annotations attached by human efforts cannot be free of mistakes and inconsistency. 
Therefore, a validating machine helps users to check up the inputs to determine whether or 
not these inputs are acceptable. STR is based on SLG. SLG has a physical-based algorithm 
to check every space whether it is overlapped, separate, adjacent, or connected by accesses 
or not, and to automatically modify the relative positions of the relevant spaces to satisfy 
assigned topologies. When a user wants to validate the inputted topology, STR will then (1) 
check every space whether it complies the topology assigned by the user or not, and (2) try 
to modify the relative positions of the relevant spaces, and/or (3) prompt the conflicts if any 
problem goes beyond the algorithm of SLG. 
Since the SLG-based algorithm is very simple for now, STR cannot automatically 
correct all conflicts caused by the inconsistent topologies. However, by comparing the 
previous layout inputted by the user to the new layout modified by STR, and by the visual 
cues of conflicts provided by STR, the user should be able to detect any inconsistency in the 
topological layout and to correct the inputted topological relations by interactions of relevant 
spaces in STR. 
 
3.3. TOPOLOGICAL LAYOUT AS VISUAL RETRIEVAL 
When a user finishes the topological layout of a floor plan, the layout will be stored in 
OCS database and, there, the user can retrieve it and its relevant image files of the floor plan. 
STR provides the same interface for annotating and retrieving topological layouts in the case 
library. By drawing spaces and assigning topological relations to those spaces, the user can 
enter a partial topological layout as a query in order to retrieve a similar layout in the case 
library. 
Based on the features of a queried layout, STR can rank the similarities of the query and 
the stored layouts in OCS database by comparing the semantic attributes--the name of a 
space, dimensions, relative positions, assigned topological relation, etc. Then, STR can 
retrieve cases with the similar topology and sort the similarities by the ranking results. Via 
STR’s visual and instinct manipulations, OCS can be a visual and interactive encoding and 
indexing tool for spatial topology. STR can then assist the designers in coding the existing 
design cases, indexing, and retrieving spatial topology of the design cases by searching and 
mapping functions of the OCS database, and further derive the similarities and differences 
among the retrieved cases. 
 
3.4. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STR 
OCS is an online case library of house design cases, which is developed in MySQL 
rational database, PHP script language for server-side data accessing, and JavaScript for 
client-side interface. The semantic information of the case features and their semantic
