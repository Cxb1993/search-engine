Abstract— It is difficult to design controllers for the complicated dynamics of omnidirectional 
vehicles steered by multiple wheels in distributed traction force.  In this research, the dynamic model 
of a three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle, which is linearized for simplifying controller design, is 
developed.  The conditions of making its dynamics linear are derived first.  Then, a strategy of 
planning wheel velocities to satisfy these conditions is proposed.  Consequently, three-wheel 
omnidirectional vehicle can be easily treated by classical linear control theories.  Finally, a linear 
optimal tracker is designed to control the omnidirectional vehicle for desired movement trajectories.  
In particular, the dynamic model includes the motors installed in the three-wheel omnidirectional 
vehicle, making it a practical model.  Three kinds of vehicle trajectories illustrate the planning of 
wheel trajectories for linearizing the vehicle dynamics, and simulation demonstrates the performance 
of the linear optimal tracker.  In addition, experimental results of a practical three-wheel 
omnidirectional vehicle are also included.

dynamics is proposed.  In contrast to minimum time trajectories developed by Kalmár-Nagy et al. [17] and 
Purwin and D’Andrea [23], the wheels’ velocity trajectories that lead an omnidirectional vehicle dynamics 
to be linear are derived.  As its dynamics is linear, controlling an omnidirectional vehicle to follow a derived 
trajectory becomes easy. 
Kinematic equations of a vehicle involve the velocity relationship between wheels and body.  Vehicle 
dynamics influences its body movement, but the traction force of the vehicle results from the wheels’ 
rotation, which in turn is related to its body movement via kinematics.  Intuitively, kinematics relates to 
dynamics when a vehicle is steered by wheels’ traction force.  In this research, a dynamic model simplified 
by kinematic constraint is proposed.  Although many researchers have developed control algorithms based 
on backstepping design to combine kinematics into dynamics [9][12][16], their ideas focused almost 
exclusively on vehicle dynamics in their control models.  The aim of this research is to develop a simplified 
model based on vehicle dynamics combined with its kinematics for easy controller design.  In fact, the 
complicated dynamics of a three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle solved by kinematics becomes a simple 
linear model.  A linear optimal tracker is thus suitable for the difficult problem of controlling the three-wheel 
omnidirectional vehicle.  The kinematics involved in the dynamics of the three-wheel omnidirectional 
vehicle simplifies its control problem.  That is the main contribution of this research. 
The kinematic transformation of wheel velocity to the velocity of the three-wheel omnidirectional 
vehicle is the vital factor in linearizing its dynamics.  The control problem of the three-wheel 
omnidirectional vehicle turns into a problem of planning wheel velocity trajectory to maintain linear 
dynamics.  In this research, three cases used as examples illustrate the problem of planning wheel trajectories 
for linear dynamics.  In addition, a linear optimal tracker solves the control problem of the three-wheel 
omnidirectional vehicle in linear dynamics.  This research demonstrates that the hard problem of controlling 
the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle becomes easy trajectory planning rather than complicated 
dynamics. 
The remainder of this research is organized as follows.  In section 2, new nonlinear dynamic equations 
of a three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle including motor model are derived.  The conditions of making the 
new nonlinear dynamic equations linear are derived in section 3.  In section 4, a linear optimal tracker for 
easily controlling the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle is proposed.  A way to plan wheels’ velocity 
trajectories to maintain the conditions of the vehicle in linear dynamics is proposed in section 5.  In section 6, 
the designed controller is demonstrated by simulation and experiments.  Finally, conclusions and discussion 
are given in section 7.

It is convenient to calculate absolute position and velocity as the vehicle is moving by transforming the 
vehicle frame (xr, yr) to workspace frame (xb, yb).  Let the vector P0 = [x, y]T be the position of the CM in the 
workspace frame.  Then, the drive positions and velocities of three wheels are given by 
ri = P0 + R(θ)P0i, (4) 
vi = i00 P)(RP θ+  , respectively, for i = 1, …, 3. (5) 
And then the individual wheel velocity is

Eq. (8) is usually named the inverse kinematics equation of the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle.  The 
motor traction force is the source of the vehicle motion. 
A model of the vehicle motor is depicted by Fig. 2, where Tl is the torque of a rolling vehicle wheel, 
ω+= )BsJ(T mmm  is the steering torque of the motor rotor.  Notice that Jm and Bm is the inertia moment and 
the viscous friction of the motor rotor, respectively.  If the motor steers via a gear box, Bm includes gear 
viscous friction.  As shown in Fig. 2, the torque of a rolling wheel is

where ω is the angle velocity of the motor, Ra is armature resistance, La is armature inductance, KM is a

motor. 
It is crucial to understand the relationship between motor traction force and vehicle motion to calculate 
the dynamics of the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle.  The following Lemma derives this relationship. 
Lemma 1: Let f be the motor traction force, u be the driving source of the motor, v be the linear velocity from

It is difficult to design a controller for the nonlinear and time-varying dynamic system as (16).  
Simplifying this dynamics for easy control of three-wheel omnidirectional vehicles was a major motivation 
of this study.  The methods to do so are presented in the following sections. 
III. THE DYNAMICS OF OMNIDIRECTIONAL VEHICLES SIMPLIFIED BY ITS KINEMATICS 
The main idea of this research is to simplify the dynamics of the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle as 
a linear time invariant model.  In this section, the conditions of the vehicle in a simplified model are derived.  
The usage of these conditions is also discussed. 
The main idea of simplifying the vehicle model is to combine its kinematics into its dynamics.  The 
vehicle forward kinematic equation derived from inverse kinematic equation Eq. (8) is

The following Theorem discloses the conditions of the vehicle dynamics simplified in a linear form. 
Theorem 1: Let a three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle maneuver along a trajectory X(t) in configuration 
space.  If its wheels’ velocities V(t) related to )t(X  satisfies inverse kinematic equation Eq. (8), then its 
 9
Given a trajectory )t(X  ([ )t(x  )t(y )t(θ ]T), the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle should been planned 
under Eq. (8) under condition (1) for its dynamics to be linear.  Note that condition (2) does not restrict the 
position trajectory of the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle.  This is because the particular advantage of 
omnidirectional vehicles is that the orientation trajectory θ(t) is independent of the position trajectory [x(t) 
y(t)].  Hence, its orientation trajectory )t(θ  can be manipulated with regardless of its position trajectory 
[ )t(x  )t(y ].  In general, it is not difficult to let the vehicle change by a fixed angle within the time of a fixed 
period.  As a result, the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle can be planned to maneuver on any position 
trajectory under condition (2).  In section V, three kinds of trajectories illustrate how to keep its dynamics 
linear. 
IV. DESIGN OF A LINEAR OPTIMAL TRACKER 
Once it is possible to linearize the dynamics of the three-wheel omnidirectional vehicle, linear optimal 
theories are suitable for its control.  In this section, a linear optimal tracker for the control of the three-wheel 
omnidirectional vehicle is proposed.  Finally, the linear optimal tracker is summarized by a calculation 
schema. 
Let a linear time invariant system be Eq. (21), W(t) be desired velocity in which t ∈ [t0, T], and C be a 
linear combination matrix for the scalar of v(t) corresponding to W(t).  Then, a controller U(t) is designed for 
minimizing a performance index defined as follows 
)T(MY)T(Y
2
1)t(J T0 = dt)]t(RU)t(U)t(QY)t(Y[2
1 T
t
TT
0∫ ++ , (22) 
where Y(t) = (CV(t) – W(t)) is the tracking error of wheel velocity, M, Q, and R are the matrices of weighting 
factors for terminal condition, tracking error and controller output, respectively, and M ≥ 0 , Q ≥ 0, and R > 
0 are all symmetric.  Note that D(t), the high order variables in Eq. (21), is regarded as system disturbance.  
Therefore, the control problem of the vehicle based on this performance index becomes optimal tracking 
control with disturbance. 
Here, a linear optimal tracking controller based on continuous linear quadratic tracker [18] is designed.  
However, the system as shown in Eq. (21) includes disturbance D(t) that is temporarily neglected.  The linear 
optimal tracking control law for the system with disturbance should be solved as follows. 
Theorem 2: For the linear time invariant dynamic system Eq. (21), the linear optimal tracker designed for the 
performance index Eq. (22) is: 
QCCSBSBRSASAS TT1T +−+=− − , S(T) = CTMC, (23) 
K(t) = R-1BTS(t), (24) 
 11
disturbance.  
 
Fig. 3. The calculation schema of the linear optimal tracker for overcoming disturbance. 
To summarize, the linear optimal tracker consists of an optimal tracking controller and a kinematic 
transformation to achieve the mission that the wheels’ velocity trajectories satisfy its kinematic constraint.  
Fig. 3 schematizes the linear optimal tracker.  The goal of the linear optimal tracker is to control wheel 
velocities V(t) to track W(t) which is transformed from r(t) based on the vehicle kinematics.  There are two 
closed loops in Fig. 3.  The first closed loop calculates the auxiliary function g(t) for tracking W(t) and 
rejecting the disturbance )t(DE 1− .  After obtaining g(t), the linear optimal controller U(t) is calculated to 
control the vehicle in the second closed loop.  Notice that the calculation of the gain matrix K(t) is not shown 
in Fig. 3.  K(t) is obtained from Eq. (24) after solving S(t) from the Riccati equation (23).  In addition, the 
integration interval of Eqs. (23) and (25) should be replaced by [T, 0] after canceling the minus signs of their 
left hand sides because their boundary conditions given are the terminal values S(T) = CTMC and g(T) = 
CTMW(T), respectively.  Therefore, if the tracked signal W(t) and the disturbance )t(DE 1−  are given, K(t) 
and g(t) are stored by off-line computation.  When the vehicle motors are controlled by the control signal U(t) 
calculated from K(t) and g(t), V(t) tracks W(t). 
V. TRAJECTORY PLANNING FOR KINEMATIC CONSTRAINTS 
When designing a vehicle movement trajectory, it is essential to carefully plan wheel velocities to 
satisfy the conditions that the vehicle dynamics is linear.  In this section, three cases, each with a different 
kind of trajectories, illustrate the planning strategy. 
Let r(t) = [rx(t) ry(t) rθ(t)]T ∈ X(t) be the vehicle movement trajectory in configuration space based on 
workspace (xb, yb), and W(t) = [w1(t) w2(t) w3(t)]T ∈ V(t) be the desired wheel velocity trajectory.  Under the 
condition (2), )t(rθ  must be constant when planning wheels’ velocity W(t) for the vehicle movement 
trajectory.  As well, it is necessary to design W(t) to satisfy inverse kinematics Eq. (8): 
)t(r)(P)t(W θ=  = [ ]Tyx )t(r)t(r)t(r)(P θθ  . (38) 
 13
constant for the straight line.  The straight line, therefore, satisfies 
)cos())t(r(v)t(r dvehiclex θ= , 
)sin())t(r(v)t(r dvehicley θ= , and 
0)t(r =θ . (39) 
where vvehicle( )t(r ) is the trajectory as shown in Fig. 4.  For the straight line, w1(t), w2(t) and w3(t) are solved 
by substituting Eq. (39) into Eq. (38).  Notice that 0)t(r =θ  satisfies the first condition of linear vehicle 
dynamics, and that in a nonholonomic vehicle (or mobile robot), rθ must equal θd, but omnidirectional 
vehicles don’t have this constraint.  Simulation will show this property. 
Case 2: A circle trace 
Let rR be the radius of a circle trace.  Then, the relationship between the linear velocity and the angular 
velocity of the vehicle (see Eq. (13)) is obtained by 
R
vehicle
r
))t(r(v
)t(r =θ  (40) 
The equation of the circle is 
rx(t) = rRcos(rθ(t)), and 
ry(t) = rRsin(rθ(t)). (41) 
The derivative of Eq. (41) with respect to time is 
)t(r))t(rsin(r)t(r Rx θθ−=  , and 
)t(r))t(rcos(r)t(r Ry θθ=  . (42) 
Eqs. (40) and (42) substituted into Eq. (38) can solve w1(t), w2(t) and w3(t) for the wheel velocity 
trajectories.  Two situations, fixed )t(rθ  and rθ (i. e. )t(rθ =0) meet the second conditions of the vehicle in 
linear dynamics.  Simulation in the next section will show both situations. 
Case 3: Two intersecting lines 
In this case, the key point of trajectory planning is the change in wheel velocities from the end of the first 
straight line to the beginning of the second one.  It is difficult during this period always satisfying kinematic 
equation (8).  The trajectory planning of this case is illustrated by an example below.

addition to trajectory tracking, the sub-figures (e) of Figs. 7 and 8 show the vehicle’s instantaneous 
orientation.  Both results show that the optimal controller does a good job tracking the desired trajectories for 
constant rθ and θr .  Sub-figures (c) and (f) show the tracking errors of wheel velocities and vehicle position, 
respectively. 
Simulation includes controlling the vehicle to follow two connected straight lines of different slopes.  
Fig. 9 (e) shows the vehicle can be controlled at orientation π/6 to follow the two straight lines very well.  
Sub-figures (c) and (f) show the trajectory errors of wheels’ velocities and the vehicle position, respectively.

In this study, a real omnidirectional vehicle was implemented for experiments.  Fig. 10 is the vehicle 
viewed from the top and bottom.  In the vehicle, a radio frequency module is installed to receive 
experimental command, and a RS-232 cable is connected to a personal computer for storing experimental 
data.  There are two experiments: one to control the vehicle to track a straight line, the other to track a circle.

demonstrates that complicated dynamics solved by kinematics is an easy way to control omnidirectional 
vehicles.  In addition, the examples of planning wheel trajectory for maintaining the conditions of the vehicle 
dynamics in linear illustrate that the vehicle movement trajectories of straight lines and circle traces are easy, 
but those of two straight lines with different slopes are difficult.  However, the strategy of varying 
acceleration in a fixed period solves the difficulty of the latter case.  Simulation and experiments demonstrate 
these study results. 
In this research, motion planning makes the omnidirectional vehicle linear, like decoupling the 
interaction among its three wheels.  In contrast to conventional motion planning, which usually focuses on 
smooth trajectories, this is innovative, and a concrete improvement on this control problem.  In general, 
controller design of robots only takes care of its dynamics, but ignores its kinematics.  This methodology 
paves a way to consider kinematics and dynamics together for controlling robots simply and easily.  This 
suggests further development to study controller design of robot arms, legs, and so on.
