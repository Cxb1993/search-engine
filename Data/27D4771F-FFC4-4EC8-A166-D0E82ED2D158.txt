Abstract  
Hydrogen formation from synthesis gas (syngas) through high-temperature and 
low-temperature water gas shift reactions (WGSRs) was investigated in the present study, 
through both experimental measurements and numerical predictions. An experimental 
system was conducted to measure the performance of the water gas shift reactions. 
Meanwhile, numerical models describing the chemical kinetics of the water gas shift 
reaction were also developed, based on the experimental data. The experimental results 
indicated that the performance of the high-temperature WGSR increased with increasing 
temperature, revealing that the reaction was governed by chemical kinetic. In contrast, 
the performance of the low-temperature WGSR decreased as the reaction temperature 
was raised. This suggested that the thermodynamic equilibrium was the dominant 
mechanism in determining the hydrogen formation. In the developed models, the effects 
of both the reaction temperature and the steam/CO ratio were taken into account. When 
both the high-temperature WGSR and the low-temperature WGSR in the catalyst beds 
were examined, the CO conversion near the wall was always faster than that that at and 
adjacent to the centerline, as a result of slower velocity in the vicinity of the wall. 
Meanwhile, by virtue of the higher CO concentration at the entrance of the catalyst bed, 
the intensity of the WGSRs was significant nearby and it decayed rapidly downstream.

catalogued into two different ways. One is a reaction in the presence of catalysts and the 
other is a reaction without the presence of catalysts. The catalytic processes can be 
further classified into two groups, depending on the reaction temperature or catalyst type. 
They are the high-temperature shift (HTS) reaction and the low-temperature shift (LTS) 
reaction. The HTS is usually developed at temperatures ranging from  320 to 4500C. 
The LTS is operated at temperatures ranging from 200 to 2500C [Bustamante, 2004]. 
Commercially, iron-chromium based catalysts are the most widely used catalysts for the 
HTS reactions [Costa et al., 2002；Johnsen et al., 2006]. Alternatively, copper-zinc based 
catalysts have been extensively applied in developing the LTS reactions [Vanden 
Bussche and Froment, 1996；Choi and Stenger, 2003]. Aside from the Fe-Cr based 
catalysts and the Cu-Zn based catalysts, gold-based [Cameron et al., 2003] catalysts and 
platinum group metals [Tibiletti et al., 2006] can also be used to facilitate the WGSR. 
However, the prices of gold and platinum are much higher than that of the commercial 
Fe-Cr or Cu-Zn based catalysts. Other metals such as zeolite [Souza et al., 1999] and Sn, 
Ce, Ru and Rd [Basinska et al., 2004] or B, Cu, Ba, Pb, Hg and Ag [Rhodes et al., 2002] 
imbedded in the catalyst have also been studied to increase the performance of WGSR. 
An examination of the aforementioned literature shows that many outstanding studies 
have been reported. When considering the catalytic process, hydrogen generation from a 
WGSR is deeply affected by the composition of the catalyst. For this reason, the 
attentions of the studies were always focused on the preparation of the catalysts and 
relatively little focus on the performance of the WGSR.. In the present study, the 
characteristics of the WGSR affected by various operational conditions will be explored 
and described under individual existences of a HTC and a LTC in a reactor. Recognizing 
the behaviors of the WGSR with the effects of the catalysts, better reaction parameters 
will be suggested to aid in the production of hydrogen for the application of fuel cells. In 
addition, by virtue of CO2 being an important product in a WGSR and the main reason 
for causing the greenhouse effect, the behaviors of carbon sequestration through CO2 
absorption by Ca(OH)2 solutions will also be investigated. 
As far as reaction kinetics of the WGSR is concerned, two different kinetic 
mechanisms have been proposed; one is the associative (or adsorptive) mechanism and 
the other the regenerative mechanism [Armstrong and Hilditch, 1920；Rhodes et al., 
1995；Choi and Stenger, 2003]. On the other hand, by assuming the reaction rate being 
proportional to the displacement of the gas composition from its thermodynamic 
equilibrium value, Moe[1962] used a simple reversible rate to express the WGSR. 
However, in the study of Keiski et al.[1993], they discovered that the WGSR was not a 
simple order reaction when the steam/CO ratio was high. Accordingly, a power-law rate 
equation was established. Sun et al.[2005] derived the catalytic mechanism of a WGSR 
on precious metal catalyst, using a Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics model and

2. Experimental 
In the present study, both the HTSR and LTSR are first studied based on the 
experimentally conducted system. The reaction system can be referred to the last year 
report for details [Chen, 2007]. Then the reactions are modeled and simulated. In the 
models, it is assumed that the flow field is laminar and axisymmetric along the centerline 
of the reactor. Two kinds of granular catalysts used in a previously experimental study 
are considered. It is postulated that the catalyst bed is uniformly packed by the pellets 
and the bed is a uniform porous media in the prediction. That is, the temperatures at the 
interface between the catalyst and the fluid are the same. The body force of the reagents 
is ignored because of the secondary effect. Gas mixture in the reactor abides by the ideal 
gas law. 
2.1 Reaction system 
A schematic of the conducted reaction system is sketched in Fig. 1. The main 
components of the system include five units; they are: (1) the reactants input unit, (2) the 
steam generation unit, (3) the reaction unit, (4) the product gas treatment unit and (5) the 
gas analysis unit. In a WGSR, main reactants are carbon monoxide and steam. Therefore, 
in the reactants input unit, the feeding gas was stored in a steel cylinder, whereas water 
was stored in a vessel. 
Water Gas Shift Reactions (WGSR) were performed by means of a conducted 
reaction system in this study (schematic of the system is sketched in Fig. 1). As shown in 
Fig. 1, in the input unit the volumetric flow rate of water was controlled by a rotary 
pump where a calibration curve of the flow rate was first established. With regard to the 
feeding gas, the residence time or gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of the reactants (i.e. 
H2O and CO) was fixed in the study. CO and N2 were blended in a mixer and their flow 
rates were controlled by use of an electric flow rate controller. The feeding of gas (i.e. 
CO+N2) and water were simultaneously sent into the preheater in a co-current pattern. 
Water was heated and transformed into steam which would then be uniformly mixed 
with the feeding gas. The mixture was then transported into the reactor. Both the 
preheater and reactor were heated by heating elements. The power of the heating 
elements was controlled by temperature controllers and power controllers. The tube 
inside the preheater was filled with glass balls, which were able to absorb heat and 
uniformly heat the water. 
 
  6
water would evolve into steam and mix with the feeding gas. When the mixture flew into 
the reactor, the water gas shift reaction was achieved. Thereafter, the product gas was 
washed by ice water to primarily condense the moisture, followed by flowing through 
the drier to completely absorb and remove the moisture. Subsequently, the treated gas 
was analyzed in the gas analysis unit. The electrical signals from the GA, indicating the 
concentrations of CO and CO2, were sent into a computer via a signal receiver to monitor 
and record the collected data. To ensure the measurement quality, prior to performing 
experiments the feeding gas with fixed volumetric flow rate was blown into the reaction 
system. Then, the flow rate of the gas and the concentration of CO were measured at the 
system exit. This guaranteed that no gas leakage occurred. The calibrations of the GC 
and the GA were also carried out by means of standard gases to ensure that the measured 
quality of the product gas was reliable. 
2.3 Catalysts and reactants flow rates 
In the present study, two kinds of catalyst were adopted for investigations; one 
belongs to a high-temperature catalyst (HTC, Sud-Chemie SHT-4) and the other pertains 
to a low-temperature catalyst (LTC, Sud-Chemie MDC-7). Their surface areas and 
components are listed in Table 1. From the table, it can be seen that the HTC is an 
iron-chromium-based catalyst and the LTC is a copper-zinc-based catalyst. Their 
scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4800) images (×200) on the surfaces are 
demonstrated in Fig. 2. Clearly, a number of pores are observed on the surfaces where 
the pore number of the LTC is larger than that of the HTC. It can also be seen that the 
largest size of pore is around 40μm. In the following studies, three sets of CO/steam 
ratio were considered for experiments; they are 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8. The volumetric flow 
rate of water was fixed at 0.463 mL/min. Therefore, corresponding to the ratios of 1/2, 
1/4 and 1/8, the volumetric flow rates of the feeding gas (250C and 1 atm) were 3166 
mL/min, 1583 mL/min and 791 mL/min, respectively. The porosity of the two catalyst 
beds was 0.3; accordingly, one was able to calculate the residence time of the reactants 
in the catalyst beds. 
The important parameters affecting WGSR for the study include reaction temperature, 
catalyst composition, residence time and concentrations of reactants in the catalyst bed. 
The purpose of the present study is to recognize the characteristics of the HTS and LTS 
reactions at various reaction temperatures and steam/CO ratios, to provide a useful 
insight into the production of hydrogen practically. Therefore, two different catalysts, 
consisting of a high-temperature catalyst (HTC, Sud-Chemie SHT-4) and a 
low-temperature catalyst (LTC, Sud-Chemie MDC-7), have been adopted to explore the 
reactions. The components of the two catalysts and their surface areas are shown in Table 
1. The scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S4800) observations and the energy 
dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analyses of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 3. It is clear

3.3 Models of water gas shift reactions 
In Moe’s model [Moe, 1962], the reaction rate of the WGSR is written as

where k and eqK  are the reaction rate constant and the equilibrium constant, respectively. 
Conventionally, the reaction rate constant obeys Arrhenius law and it is expressed by

ETAk aexp α           (12) 
The constants A and α are determined by experiments. In our tests, it was found that 
the activation energies of the HTSR and the LTSR with 70 and 35 kJ mol-1, respectively, 
could provide good predictions. Therefore, the aforementioned values were chosen. In 
many cases, the constant α was set as 0 to simplify the physical problems. However, 
the study of Keiski et al. [1993] indicated that the WGSR was not a simple order reaction 
when the steam/CO ratio was high. For this reason, a function of steam/CO ratio is 
considered in the reaction rate constant. The reaction rate constant is written as

In the following study, the function ( )δf  will be determined in accordance with the 
experimental measurements. 
3.4 Numerical method 
In the numerical method, the SIMPLE algorithm is followed to solve the equations. 
The first order upwind scheme is used to evaluate the convective and diffusive fluxes 
over the control volume surface. An orthogonal grid system is employed. 250 and 10 
points of grid uniformly distributed along the x-axis and the y-axis, respectively, are 
adopted for the predictions. The tests indicate that the employed grid system is large 
enough to satisfy the requirement of grid independence.

is long enough to establish an appropriate WGSR, from the point of view of the HTC 
operation.

1/8, Fig. 9b. suggests that the concentrations of CO2 and H2 are promoted obviously with 
increasing reaction temperature. As regards the WGSR with the effect of the LTC, from 
Figs. 10a. and 10b. one is able to observe that a threshold for exciting the WGSR is also 
exhibited at 2000C. In other words, the excitation of the WGSR with the LTC is not 
affected by varying the CO/steam ratio. In addition, the concentrations of CO2 and H2 at 
CO/steam=1/2 is lower than those at CO/steam=1/8 to a great extent. 
Eventually, CO conversions from the WGSR under the conditions of CO/steam=1/2, 
1/4 and 1/8 are compared with each other in Fig. 11. With the condition of fixed 
volumetric flow rate of water, when the ratio is decreased from 1/2 to 1/4, the flow rate 
of the feeding gas (i.e. CO+N2) is decreased from 3166 mL/min to 1583 mL/min. This 
results in elongating the residence time of the reactants in the catalyst bed. Moreover, 
from thermodynamic equilibrium, the depletion percentage of CO will be enhanced if the 
concentration of CO in the influent stream is decreased. In view of the two reasons 
mentioned above, the CO conversions shown in Figs. 11a. and 11b. grow substantially. 
Once the ratio is decreased from 1/4 to 1/8, despite further enhancement of the two 
factors, the CO conversion is just improved to a small extent. It is thus recognized that, 
when the CO/steam ratio is large than 1/4, the performance of the WGSR is sensitive the 
variation of the ratio. Alternatively, if the ratio is smaller than 1/4, varying the ratio 
merely has a slight influence on the performance.

When the performance of the WGSR with the effect of LTC is considered, Fig. 15. 
displays the distributions of CO conversion at various reaction temperatures where the 
steam/CO ratio varies from 1 to 10. From the distributions, it is noteworthy that the CO 
conversion is fairly different from that shown in Fig. 14. For example, the CO 
conversion at 2000C is relatively high when compared with the other reaction 
temperatures, with the exception of steam/CO ratio of 1. It follows that at 2000C 
hydrogen production increases with increasing steam/CO ratio. Yet, when the reaction 
temperature is as high as 2500C, increasing either reaction temperature or steam/CO 
ratio does not give an advantage to the CO conversion nor the hydrogen generation, 
excepting the steam/CO ratio between 1 and 4. It is thus recognized that there is an 
essential difference in reaction characteristics between using the HTC and the LTC, and 
an optimal reaction temperature exists when the LTC is employed.

Fig. 17a sketches a three-dimensional profile of the CO conversion from WGSR 
with the effect of the LTC. When the steam/CO ratio is increased from 1 to 4 (the first 
regime), the CO conversion is characterized by a rapid growth, whatever the reaction 
temperature is encountered. This result resembles that shown in Fig. 16a. When the 
steam/CO ratio is beyond 4 and the reaction temperature is increased from 200 to 2500C 
(the second regime), the CO conversion declines progressively with increasing reaction 
temperature. This implies that the increase of reaction temperature inhibits the WGSR. 
For the cases of steam/CO ratio beyond 4 and reaction temperature beyond 2500C (the 
third regime), the distribution of the CO conversion behaves as a plain with increasing 
reaction temperature or steam/CO ratio. In other words, hydrogen generation is almost 
independent of the ratio and the temperature in this regime. From the above observations, 
the entire reaction characteristics can also be grouped into three regimes. In the first 
regime (steam/CO≤4 and temperature=200-4000C), the WGSR belongs to a rapid 
growth mode. In the second regime (steam/CO>4 and temperature= 200-2500C), the 
reaction is governed by a progressive decay mode. In the third regime (steam/CO>4 and 
temperature=250-4000C), the reaction intrinsically pertains to a growth-frozen mode, as 
shown in Fig. 17b. From the distributions shown in Figs. 15. and 17b., a better or 
optimal operational condition at the reaction temperature of 2000C and the steam/CO 
ratio of 4 is suggested. 
From the above results, it has been known that increasing steam/CO ratio can 
promote the CO conversion percentage, but the overall thermal efficiency of the reaction 
system may decline, as described before. As a matter of fact, the overall thermal 
efficiency will be affected by some important parameters such as reaction temperature, 
steam/CO ratio and residence time of the reactants in a catalyst bed. Therefore, the 
analysis of the overall thermal efficiency is worthy of study in the future.

respectively, basically, the entire behavior of the LTSR (Fig. 23.) is similar to that of the 
HTSR (Fig. 22.). Despite the lower pre-exponential factor of the LTSR, the lower 
activation energy leads to better performance of CO conversion and hydrogen generation 
of the LTSR (Figs. 23a. and 23b.). Fig. 24a. and 24b. further display the distributions of 
H2, CO and CO conversion of the HTSRs and the LTSRs, respectively, along the 
centerline of the reactor. With the effect of the catalysts, the concentrations of H2 grow 
rapidly downstream, whereas the concentrations of CO decay substantially. Meanwhile, 
because of the diffusion of H2 and CO2 toward the centerline from the surrounding, the 
curves of H2 and CO conversion behind the catalyst bed climb a bit.

Subsequently, the distributions of CO conversion along the centerline of the reactor 
at steam/CO=2, 4 and 8 are examined in Fig. 25. Before the reactants enter the catalyst 
bed, no chemical reactions occur when the HTSRs (Fig. 25a.) or the LTSRs (Fig. 25b.) 
are tested. Soon after the reagents flow into the porous media, CO is consumed rapidly, 
resulting from the sudden drop in activation energy. The higher the steam/CO ratio, the 
more dramatic is the growth of the CO conversion.

5. Self-evaluation 
In the present study, the goal of the three-year project has been sufficiently 
achieved. Specifically, the high-temperature and low-temperature water gas shift 
reactions have been successfully investigated experimentally. In addition, a 
high-temperature WGSR model and a low-temperature WGSR model have been 
conducted. The experimental data has elucidated that the reaction behavior of the 
high-temperature WGSR is different from that of the low-temperature WGSR, and the 
two reactions can be divided into three different regions with varying the reaction 
temperature and steam/CO ratio. On th other hand, the established models not only 
consider the reaction temperature, the effect of stem/CO ratio is also taken into account. 
Though the pre-exponential factor of the HTSR is much larger than that of the LTSR, the 
effect of the activation energy on the WGSR is more important than that of the 
pre-exponential factor. Therefore, the performance of the LTSR is better than that of the 
HTSR, and the former is consistent with the results of thermodynamic equilibrium. Apart 
from the catalysts, the velocity of fluid in the reactor also plays a remarkable role on the 
reactions, resulting from CO conversion along the centerline being lower than that near 
the wall. With the reactants marching in the catalyst bed, the H2 concentration grows, 
whereas the CO concentration declines.

HYPOTHESIS VIII Lisbon (Portugal) April 1-3, 2009
________________________________________________________________________ 2
membranes, crystalline alloy membranes and
amorphous alloy membranes [11]. In ceramic ion-
transport membranes, hydrogen is transported
across the membrane in the ionic form and catalysts
are usually used to facilitate hydrogen ionization
[12]. Carbon microporous membranes are prepared
by pyrolysing a variety of organic precursors
[13,14], and they can be used in the reducing
environment of syngas with temperatures in the
range of 773 to 1173K. However, the carbon
membranes are brittle and still expensive [4].
Crystalline alloy membranes can be of many types,
such as pure metals, binary alloys and complex
alloys. The widely studied palladium (Pd) and Pd-
alloy membranes pertain to the crystalline alloy
membranes. Though high-purity hydrogen can be
obtained through the Pd and Pd-alloy membranes,
these membranes are not suitable for operation
when the temperature is below 3000C, as a
consequence of hydrogen embrittlement [15,16].
Membranes fabricated from some low-cost
elements, such as Zr, Ni, Cu and Al, are inherently
resistant to embrittlement. This arises from the fact
that the amorphous structure resists crystalline
hydride formation. For this reason, amorphous
alloy membranes are presently being developed to
tackle the problems of hydrogen embrittlement,
sintering and cost that occur with crystalline alloy
membranes. Recent studies [17,18] indicated that
the permeability of the amorphous alloy
membranes is comparable to that of pure palladium.
Though palladium and it alloy membranes
have been studied for a long time for gas
permeation and separation applications, they are
still the membranes with the highest hydrogen
permeability and selectivity [19]. In past studies
concerning the characteristics of Pd membranes, the
majority of attention was paid to hydrogen
permeance and permeability [20], poisoning effects
of the reactant mixture on hydrogen permeation
[21], carbon deposition on the membrane [22], and
hydrogen embrittlement [23] due to low
temperature operation of the Pd membrane, and so
forth. Many outstanding researches and reviews
[16,24,25] have been reported. Nevertheless, it
should be mentioned that the past emphases were
focused on the steady-state behavior of hydrogen
permeation across a membrane, and relatively little
research has been performed on the transient mass
transfer phenomena.
2 Experimental
Reaction system
Transient dynamic of hydrogen permeation
across a palladium membrane was performed by
means of a reaction system and the schematic of
the system is sketched in Fig. 1. As a whole, the
conducted system consists of a gas input unit, a
separation or permeation unit as well as a gas
control and monitor unit. In the gas input unit, pure
hydrogen and pure nitrogen were individually
stored in steel cylinders. The hydrogen was used
for investigating the transient permeation of the Pd-
membrane, whereas the nitrogen was used for
purging the reaction system. The permeation unit
was a tubular tube which composed of an outside
stainless steel shell (18.0 mm o.d.× 200 mm length)
and a inside membrane tube (9.8 mm o.d.× 150 mm
length). In the membrane tube, a thin palladium
membrane was supported on a porous stainless
steel tube and the thickness of the Pd membrane
was 20 μm. One mass flow controller (KD-4000)
and one flow meter were installed behind the
permeation unit. The mass flow controller was
placed at the exit of the retentate side of the
membrane tube. The controller’s signal was sent to
a readout device (Brooks 5850E) to indicate the
instantaneous flow rate, and the flow rate of
hydrogen was controlled in accordance with the
reference set in the readout. The flow meter was
located at the exit of the permeate side to measure
the flow rate of the permeated hydrogen. The
pressure of the system was controlled by regulators
and a back pressure valve. The regulators were
placed at the exit of the steel cylinders. The back
pressure valve was connected to the retentate side
at the exit of the membrane tube. In addition, a
pressure gauge was installed in the permeation unit
to monitor the pressure at the retentate side of the
membrane tube.
Experimental procedure
Prior to measuring the transient dynamic of
hydrogen permeation, the entire system was leak
tested by nitrogen with gauge pressure of 10 atm. If
the membrane tube had leaks, the nitrogen could be
detected by the flow meter located at the permeate
side of the membrane tube and the system pressure
would drop. In the present study, two important
parameters affecting hydrogen transfer rate were
considered; they were the operation temperature of
the Pd membrane and the pressure difference
between the two sides of the membrane tube. To
provide a basis of investigation, the flow rate of
hydrogen at the retentate side was fixed at 50 sccm
(50 cc min-1 at 25 0C) and the hydrogen was
controlled by the mass flow controller. Three
different membrane temperatures of 330, 350 and
370 0C were regarded. Three different pressure
differences between the two sides of the membrane
were also taken into account; they were 3, 5 and 8
atm. Before the experiments were carried out, pure
hydrogen with the pressure difference of 5 atm was
sent into the reaction system for 5 minutes.
Thereafter, pure nitrogen with the same pressure
difference was blown into the system to purge the

denote the hydrogen
permeation flux, the permeance, the permeability,

respectively. In examining the past studies, it
indicates that the n values of Pd membranes usually
range from 0.5 to 1.0 [20,25-27]. In the present
study, it is found that the n value of 0.6 will
follows Sievert’s law. Because of this, the n value
of 0.6 is adopted. Regarding the transient
permeation process, the temporal permeance ( Kt )
of hydrogen thus can be defined by

where the subscript t stands for the transient state.
The distributions of the temporal permeance at the
membrane temperatures of 330, 350 and 370 0C are
shown in Figs. 5a, 5b and 5c, respectively.
Whatever the membrane temperature is, the
increasing tendency of tK at 5 atm is always
faster than that at 8 atm, stemming from the
concave up nature in the initial period.
Alternatively, seeing that the characteristic of time
lag is exhibited at 3 atm, the time required for the
permeance to reach the steady state is by far longer
than the other two cases.
Activation energy of hydrogen permeation
Subsequently, Figs. 6a and 6b display the
distributions of the steady state permeance (Kss) and
permeability (Kss’) of the Pd membrane at various
operation conditions where the n value of 0.6 is
adopted, as mentioned above. Apparently, as long
as the membrane temperature is fixed, the values of
Kss and Kss’are almost independent of the pressure
difference. This reveals that the hydrogen
permeation rate at the steady state does abide by
Sieverts’law. At present, the obtained results
indicate that the values of Kss are in the range of
2.91×10-5 and 4.03×10-5 mol m-2 s-2 Pa-0.6, whereas
the values of Kss’ are between 5.81×10-10 and
8.05×10-10 mol m-2 s-1 Pa-0.6.
Furthermore, the effect of varied membrane
temperature on the steady state permeance is
usually expressed by

where K0’, Ea and T designates the pre-
exponential factor related to the permeability, the
apparent activation energy for the process and the
membrane temperature, respectively. After the
analyses, the values of Ea and K0’at the three
selected pressure differences are shown in Table 1.
The values of the apparent activation energy range
from 10.75 to 17.73 kJ/mol, which are in the same
order as those of other studies [20,25-27]. If all the
pressure differences are considered, the apparent
activation energy is 14.72 kJ/mol.
Hydrogen permeation ratio and recovery
Hydrogen permeation ratios between the
permeate side and the retentate side at the selected
pressures and membrane temperatures are plotted in
Fig. 7a, whereas the hydrogen recovery at the
permeate side with respect to the total hydrogen
flow rate at the inlet are provided in Fig. 7b. It is
obvious that the smaller the membrane temperature
and the pressure difference are, the less the
hydrogen permeation rate through the membrane,
and vice versa. When the membrane temperature
and the pressure difference are 330 0C and 3 atm,
respectively, the hydrogen permeation ratio is 4.1.
In contrast, under the condition of 3700C and 8 atm,
the hydrogen permeation ratio is obviously
promoted to 12.0 (Fig. 7a). It reflects that the
permeation ratio increases substantially with
increasing membrane temperature and pressure
difference. In examining the hydrogen recovery,
corresponding to the aforementioned conditions the
values are 80.4% and 92.3%, respectively. In other
words, for the membrane with the temperature of
3700C and the pressure difference of 8 atm, over
90% of hydrogen can be recovered from the inlet
stream.
4 Conclusions
Unsteady hydrogen permeation across a
palladium membrane has been studied
experimentally in the present study. The obtained
results suggest that the hydrogen permeation
mechanism is highly related to the driving force of
the mass transfer. When a low pressure difference
is encountered, such as 3 atm, the relatively low
driving force leads to the hydrogen permeation
being characterized by a three-stage mass transfer
process. The process includes a time lag period, a
concave up period and a concave down period,
sequentially. Increasing pressure difference
enhances the driving force of the hydrogen
permeation. As a result, a two-stage rather than the
three-stage mass transfer process is observed at the
pressure difference of 5 atm, and the concave up
period withers significantly. With increasing the
pressure difference to 8 atm, the hydrogen
permeation further evolves into a single stage
process where only the concave down period is
