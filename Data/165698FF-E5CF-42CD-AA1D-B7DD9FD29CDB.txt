m transmitted data bits bt0, b

1, · · · , btm−1 are represented as
one symbol bt =
∑m−1
i=0 b
t
i × 2i ∈ {0, 1, 2, · · · ,M − 1}. The
transmitted baseband symbol at time t is denoted by xt ∈ S,
and the corresponding received baseband symbol is
rt = xtejθ + nt (1)
where nt is zero-mean additive white complex Gaussian noise
(AWGN), and θt is an unknown channel phase assumed to be
constant for two consecutive symbols. Represent xt by xt =
ω(at) where 0 ≤ at < M is an integer and ω is a function
which maps at to xt. For convenience of presentation, we
use at to denote the signal point of the constellation in the
rest of this paper. Figure 1 shows the constellations of 8PSK,
16QAM, 16APSK and 16TAPSK, and at of signal points. The
following is the deﬁnition of differential encoding in [3].
Deﬁnition 1: Differential encoding is a function that, for any
xt−1 ∈ S, maps bt to xt = E(xt−1,bt) ∈ S such that for
bt 6= b′t, xt = E(xt−1,bt) 6= x′t = E(xt−1,b′t).
At time t, a conventional differential detector at the re-
ceiver determines bt based on two consecutive symbols rt−1
and rt. Therefore, (xt−1, xt) forms a codeword of interest.
Let dnc((xt−1, xt), (x′t−1, x
′
t)) denote the noncoherent dis-
tance between (xt−1, xt) and (x′t−1, x
′
t), which is deﬁned
by d2nc(c, c
′) = 12 (‖c‖2 + ‖c′‖2) − | < c, c′ > | where
<,> denotes the complex inner product [9]. If two codewords
(xt−1, xt) and (x′t−1, x
′
t) satisfy (xt−1, xt) = (x
′
t−1, x
′
t)e

for some θ, they are noncoherently indistinguishable, i.e.,

dnc((xt−1, xt), (x′t−1, x
′
t)) = 0. In [3], the minimum nonco-
herent distance of a differential encoder was deﬁned by
dmin = min
xt−1,x′t−1∈S
bt 6=b′t
dnc((xt−1, xt), (x′t−1, x
′
t)) (2)
where xt = E(xt−1,bt) and x′t = E(x
′
t−1,b
′
t).
Let all (xt−1, xt) codewords which correspond to the same
bt form a group. Consequently, there are totally M groups,
denoted by G0, G1, · · · , GM−1, and each group contains M
codewords (xt−1 = x0, xt), (xt−1 = x1, xt), · · · , (xt−1 =
xM−1, xt). To maximize dmin, if two codewords (xt−1, xt)
and (x′t−1, x
′
t) have small dnc((xt−1, xt), (x
′
t−1, x
′
t)), one
should put them into the same group if possible; Otherwise,
they should be put into two different groups which differ
smallest number of bits in bt. The algorithm to optimize
differential encoding is listed as follows.
Step 1 Sort all
(
M2
2
)
possible codeword pairs c = (xt−1, xt)
and c′ = (x′t−1, x
′
t) according to dnc(c, c
′), from
small values to large values.
Step 2 Arrange G0, G1, · · · , GM−1, and L: Take codeword
pairs one by one from the sorted codeword pairs in
order. Put two codewords of a pair into the same
group if possible; Otherwise, put them into two
different groups and the two groups are written into
the list of near group pairs denoted by L.
Step 3 Assign bt to G0, G1, · · · , GM−1 according to L:
Take group pairs one by one in order from L. The
number of different bits in bt for the considered two
groups should be as small as possible.
In [3], after three steps, we obtain the optimized table for
differential 16QAM shown in Table I, in which each column
shows M values of at for a given value of at−1, and different
rows represent different bt. At time t, according to at−1 and
bt, at can be obtained by looking up this table. However, the
task of assigning data bits in Step 3 is done by hands, which
is complicated and may not obtain the best assignment when
M is large such as 64.

possible values, the differential encoding can be represented
by anM -state trellis diagram shown in Fig. 4(b) in which state
i denotes at−1 (or at) = i. A distinct differential encoder E
(i.e., a distinct look-up table) means a distinct labeling of bt
to trellis branches.
Differential encoding by a table is equivalent to differential
encoding by a trellis. But with the trellis, a differential detector
can utilize the Viterbi algorithm. Using the Viterbi algorithm
with truncation length λ = 1 is equivalent to conventional dif-
ferential detection. However, using the Viterbi algorithm with
truncation length λ > 1 can improve the error performance,
except the M -state trellis diagram is equivalent to a one-
state trellis diagram. Usually, the M -state trellis diagram is
equivalent to a trellis diagram with fewer states. The following
theorem indicates the sufﬁcient number of states.
Theorem 1: Consider a differential encoder E whose min-
imum noncoherent distance is nonzero. If there is a par-
tition {S0, S1, · · · , SL−1} of the signal set S (i.e., S =
S0 ∪ S1 ∪ · · · ∪ SL−1 and Si ∩ Sj = ∅∀i 6= j) satisfying
Si = Si−1ej
2pi
L ∀0 < i < L, then an M/L-state trellis diagram
is sufﬁcient.
Divide S0 into two subsets S′0 and S
′′
0 such that ∀xt−1 ∈
S′′0 , ∃x′t−1 ∈ S′0 satisﬁes E(xt−1,bt) = E(x′t−1,bt) for all
bt. Furthermore, an ML − n-state trellis is sufﬁcient for this
differential encoder E where n denotes the number of the
symbols in S′′0 .
Proof: For any codeword (xt−1, xt), there is an integer k
satisfying (xt−1, xt)ej
2pi
L k = (x0t−1 ∈ S0, x′t ∈ S). Deﬁne
an M/L-state trellis diagram in which states represent all
possible values of x0t−1, i.e., all elements in S0. Because
the noncoherent distance between (xt−1, xt) and (x0t−1, x
′
t)
is zero, the two codewords have the same data bits bt –
otherwise the minimum noncoherent distance of E is zero.
Hence, the output of the differential encoder xt = E(xt−1,bt)
can be obtained by xt = x′te−j
2pi
L k = E(x0t−1,bt)xt−1/x
0
t−1.
Because xt can be generated by E(x0t−1bt) and xt−1 without
E(xt−1,bt), this M/L-state trellis diagram is enough. At
the receiver, since (xt−1, xt) and (x0t−1, x
′
t) have the same
decoding metric and bt, this M/L-state trellis diagram is
sufﬁcient.
Because ∀xt−1 ∈ S′′0 , ∃x′t−1 ∈ S′0 satisﬁes E(xt−1,bt) =
E(x′t−1,bt) for all bt, we can use the state of x
′
t−1 to
represent the state of xt−1 also. Consequently, n states can
be omitted so an ML − n-state trellis is sufﬁcient for this E.
¤
We ﬁrst consider differential M -ary PSK whose S is
S = {1, ej2pi 1M , ej2pi 2M , · · · , , ej2piM−1M }. Figure 1(a) shows
the constellation with M = 8. There is a partition
{S0, S1, · · · , SM−1} of S where Si = {ej2pi iM } satisfying
the requirement of Theorem 1 with L = M , so a single-state
trellis is sufﬁcient. Therefore, a differential detector using the
Viterbi algorithm cannot improve the error performance.
Then consider M -ary APSK and M -ary TAPSK with two
rings, whose constellations and at for M = 16 are shown in
Fig. 1. It can be observed that a partition {S0, S1, · · · , SM
2 −1}
of S where Si = {w(2i), w(2i+1)} satisﬁes Theorem 1 with
L = M2 . Consequently, a two-state trellis is sufﬁcient. For
the encoding table of 16APSK in [3], the two columns are
the same, so it is unnecessary to use the Viterbi algorithm
according to Theorem 1. For the encoding table of 16TAPSK,
Table II, the two columns are different, so differential detection
using the Viterbi algorithm with a two-state trellis can enhance
error performance.
Finally we consider M -ary QAM. The constellation and
at for M = 16 are presented in Fig. 1(d). A partition
{S0, S1, · · · , SM
4 −1} of S where Si = {w(4i), w(4i +
1), w(4i + 2), w(4i + 3)} satisﬁes Theorem 1 with L = M4 .

We use the algorithms in [3] to construct the encoding
table. The ﬁrst algorithm in Step 2 [3], which guarantees
optimization but does not guarantee convergence, is
successful. For convenience of presentation, represent Xt−1
and Xt by Xt−1 = Xat−1 and Xt = Xat and use (at−1, at)
to denote the DSTM codeword hereafter. There are 64
noncoherently indistinguishable, i.e., ζ = 0, codeword pairs
{(0, 0), (1, 1)}, {(0, 0), (2, 2)}, {(0, 0), (3, 3)}, {(0, 1), (1, 8)},
· · · , {(2, 15), (3, 14)}. Table III shows the obtained optimal
table of at in which the two codewords of each noncoherently
indistinguishable codeword pair belong to the same data bits.
The DSTM deﬁned by Table III has ζ = 0.5, which is better
than ζ of other DSTM without constellation expansion with 2
bits/sec/Hz, including the DSTM from [5] and [6]. Compared
with the DSTM with 2 bits/sec/Hz in [7] and [8] whose signal
constellation is expanded from QPSK to 9QAM, our DSTM
has the same ζ while the used constellation is QPSK only.
Simulation results for the quasistatic ﬂat fading channel with
nR = 2 are shown in Fig. 6. We compare this DSTM with
other DSTM from [5], [6] and [8]. Among all DSTM without
constellation expansion, the proposed DSTM is the best. We
ﬁnd that for the proposed DSTM using Table III, the average
number of the nearest codewords to the transmitted codeword
is 19.125, which is larger than the average number of the
DSTM in [8], 8. Therefore, differential detection without trellis
(λ = 1) for the proposed DSTM is slightly worse than the
DSTM in [8]. To improve the error performance, differential

detection by a trellis is considered. According to Theorem 2,
a four-state trellis is sufﬁcient since all columns of Table III
are different. The branch metric is ‖R†t−1Xt−1 + R†tXt‖ −
‖R†t−1Xt−1‖ [12] is used. At high SNRs, differential detection
using the four-state trellis with λ = 5 for the proposed DSTM
is similar to the DSTM in [8].
