known at the receiver to coherently combine the multiple temporal received signals 
for decodinga. Since STBC potentially entails low spectral efficiency and training 
based channel estimation further consumes bandwidth resource, blind approaches 
then become appealing candidate solutions. There has been extensive literature on 
blind multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel estimation [14], [16]. However, only 
a few studies are tailored for STBC systems, typically through a multi-input 
single-output (MISO) channel link. Under flat-fading assumption, several schemes 
were put forth for orthogonal STBC [4], [7], [32], and for a general linear code family 
[33]. For time-reversal STBC over frequency-selective channels, the work [5] focused 
on codes with time-domain equalization [26]. Through linear symbol precoding, blind 
schemes for OFDM-based STBC were shown in [27] and [40]. The method [27] 
resorts to zero-padding for removing inter-block interference, and is applicable only 
for constant-modulus sources and channel pairs without common zeros; the one in 
[40], instead, uses cyclic prefix (CP) as guard interval and leverages redundant 
precoding to relieve the source and channel-zero constraints imposed in [27]. For 
FDE-STBC, training based channel estimation is recently considered in [11]. It is 
known that single-carrier FDE systems fall within the class of precoded OFDM, with 
FFT matrix as precoder [25]. In view of this fact, the method in [40] for OFDM 
scenario also provides an immediate blind solution for FDE-STBC: one just chooses 
FFT precoding matrix to convert the multi-carrier transmission into a single-carrier 
scheme and then inserts certain redundancy into the symbol streams to facilitate 
channel identification. The price to be paid for this approach, however, would be the 
                                                 
a Differential STBC does not require channel information for decoding but incurs a 3-dB penalty in 
SNR [22, Sec. 9.6].

robustness. We consider two models of data mismatch, one as an unknown 
deterministic perturbation while the other statistically as a white noise, and propose 
the associated optimal precoder design criteria, aiming for minimizing the worst-case 
solution sensitivity to perturbation and mean-square errors, respectively. Both 
optimization problems are further formulated to take advantage of the BCCB system 
matrix property and are then analytically solved; the resultant solutions are shown to 
be the same two-level form precoder. Pair-wise error probability (PEP) analysis is 
conducted to investigate the equalization performance of the proposed optimal 
solution and characterize the associated design trade-off. It is noted that blind channel 
estimation via non-redundant diagonal precoding has been considered in the single 
channel case [31], [10], [24], [37]; the related generalizations to MIMO single- and 
multi-carrier spatial multiplexing systems can be found in [8] and [9]. The rest of this 
paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly describes the system model and the 
underlying assumptions. Section III presents the proposed method; the associated key 
features are investigated in Section IV. Section V addresses the optimal precoder 
design against imperfect data estimation. Section VI examines the equalization 
performance through PEP analysis. Section VII contains the simulation results. 
Finally, Section VIII is the conclusion.

System Model and Basic Assumptions 
 
 
 
We consider the discrete-time baseband model of an FDE-STBC system [2] over 
frequency-selective channels as shown in Figure 1. Let ks  and 1k+s  be two 
N-dimensional symbol blocks to be transmitted. Priori to the STBC encoder, each 
symbol block is precoded by an N N×  diagonal matrix 
 [ ]{ }: (0) ( 1)Tdiag p p N= −P " ,  (2.1) 
with R( )p n ∈ , to obtain 
 l l=x Ps , for  , 1l k k= + ,  (2.2) 
which are then spatially and temporally coded according to [2] for transmit diversity 
as well as for mitigating the multipath channel distortion. For 1 2i≤ ≤ , let ( )ih n  
be the impulse response of the channel between the thi transmit antenna and the 
receive antenna. In terms of block signals, the input-output relations in time-domain 
are described as [2] 
 1 2 1k k k k++ +y = G x G x v , (2.3) 
and 
 8
where 1 1 2 2:
H H N N×= + ∈D D D D D R  is diagonal with 2 21 2ii iiii⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤= +⎢ ⎥ ⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦⎣ ⎦D D D , 
1 i N≤ ≤ : this asserts that two-fold transmit diversity is achieved in the frequency 
domain. To recover the source signals, per-tone frequency-domain equalizer [2], [15] 
can be designed based on (2.8), as long as a channel estimate is available at the 
receiver. Based on the time-domain signal model (2.3) and (2.4), this paper proposes a 
blind channel estimation scheme by using the second-order statistics of the received 
signal and discusses an optimal design of the precoder ( )p n  for improving channel 
estimation accuracy. The following assumptions are made in the sequel. 
 
a) The source sequence ( )s n  is independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) with 
zero mean and *( ) ( ) ( )Es k s l k lδ= − , where ()δ ⋅  is the Kronecker delta 
function. 
b) The noise ( )v n  is white circular Gaussian with zero mean, variance 2vσ , and is 
independent of the source sequence ( )s n . 
 10
With (2.2) and (3.2), the signal models (2.3) and (2.4) then become 
  1 2 1k k k k++ +y = G Ps G Ps v ,  (3.3) 
and 
 * *1 21 1 1k k k k+ + += − +y G Ps G Ps vΓ Γ .  (3.4) 
From (3.3), (3.4), and by assumptions a) and b), it is easy to check 
   
{ }2 22 1 1 2 1 21 1 1 1 1(1) : T T T T T Tk k k k k k k kE E E EΓ Γ+ + + + += = − + + +yR y y G P G G P G G P s v G P s v v v
.    (3.5) 
Since the noise ( )v n  is circular, we have 1
T
k k NE + =v v 0 . Also, we assume that both 
the real and imaginary components of the noise process are independent of those of 
the source sequence ( )s n : this thus implies 1 1 1
T T
k k k k NE E+ + += =s v s v 0 . Under 
these conditions, the noise contributions to the conjugate cross-correlation matrix 
(1)yR  in (3.5) become a zero matrix, leading to 
 2 22 1 1 2(1)
T T= −yR G P G G P GΓ Γ .  (3.6) 
For a given (1)yR , the matrix equation (3.6) defines a set of 
2N  scalar equations 
nonlinear in the unknowns , , , (0) ( ) 1 2i ih h L i≤ ≤" , but is linear with respect to 
product channel coefficients ( ) ( )i ih k h l , ,1 2i i≤ ≤ . As a result, in lieu of directly 
solving for , , (0) ( )i ih h L" , we propose to exploit the imbedded linear structure in 
(1)yR  for channel estimation. This will be done by further taking into account the 
circulant property of the channel matrices iG ’s. 
 
  Specifically, define the following permutation matrix 
 12
that (1)yR  in (3.11) is a weighted sum of N  matrices of the form ( )N nn T −J G J , 
in which the unknown G  are pre, and post, multiplied by the known matrices nJ  
and ( )N nT −J . Based on this structural property, we can further rearrange (3.11) into 
a standard linear equation form. This is done via the next lemma.

The 2 2N N×  real-valued matrix Q  defined in (3.14), which is characterized by 
the N  circulant matrices { }, , , 2 2 2 1(0) (1) ( 1) NNp p p N −−I J J"  on the top row 
block, is block circulant with circulant blocks (BCCB) [12, p-184]. Equation (3.14) 
forms the basis of the proposed approach.

approach for blind channel estimation is also adopted in [13], [21], [24], [37]. 
 
C. On Ambiguity Removal 
 
  The matrix ambiguity (3.18) can be resolved through insertion of additional pilot 
symbols. To see this, let 1 2
⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦h h  be a dominant left singular vector pair associated 
with the rank-two matrix H  defined in (3.15). Then we have 
1 2 1 2
⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤=⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦h h h h U , with 
2 2×∈U C  fulfilling (3.18); this implies

h h h h U h h h h .  (3.20) 
Since both 1G  and 2G  are circulant, the first output branch (2.3), at some 0k k= , 
can be alternatively expressed as 
 
0 0 0 01 21k k k k+
+ +y = C g C g v ,  (3.21) 
where ig  , ( 1 2)i =  is the zero-padded channel impulse response as in (2.6), and 
N N
l
×∈C C  is circulant with the precoded symbol vector lx  as the first column, 
0 0, 1l k k= + . Let us write 
 1 ( 1)
T
T
i i N L× − −
⎡ ⎤= ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦g h 0 , 1 2i≤ ≤ ,  (3.22) 
where ih  is the desired channel impulse response vector defined in (3.17). With 
(3.22), equation (3.21) is then reduced to 
 
0 0 0 01 21k k k k+
+ +y = C h C h v  ,  (3.23) 
where ( 1)N Ll
× +∈C C  contains the first 1L +  columns of lC . With (3.20), we can 
 16
 
estimation formulation as well as the circulant signal structure (the proposed channel 
estimation procedures are outlined in Table I). 
 
 
 18
 
Then the 2N  eigenvalues of the matrix Q  defined in (3.14) are given by the N  
replicas of the N -tuple { }, , , 1(1) ( ) ( )Nω ω −p p p" .    
                         
  Theorem 4.1 shows that channel identifiability is guaranteed whenever ( ) 0nω ≠p  
for all 0 1n N≤ ≤ − ; this condition is quite mild and can hold for almost all 
choices of ( )p n . We should note that the significance of Theorem 4.1 is far above 
just characterizing a sufficient condition for unique channel recovery. It moreover 
specifies the eigenvalues associated with the matrix Q : this result will be exploited 
for selecting ( )p n  to improve the reliability of channel estimate against the 
finite-sample estimation error (see Section V). 
 
B. Computation of ( )vec G  
  A crucial step for implementing the proposed channel estimation scheme is the 
computation of the product channel coefficient vector ( )vec G  based on (3.14). In 
what follows we propose two methods for fulfilling this task. 
 
  i) Direct Matrix Inversion: An immediate approach to solving (3.14) is through 
direct matrix inversion so that 
 ( ) ( )1 (1)vec vec−= yG Q R .  (4.3) 
Observe from (3.14) that Q  is BCCB and is characterized by the particular set of 
circulant matrices { }, , , 2 2 2 1(0) (1) ( 1) NNp p p N −−I J J" . This appealing structure 
allows for a potentially low-complexity implementation via FFT operations. In 
 20
(4.7) 
The matrix R
2 2( 1)N L× +∈Q  in (4.7) is obtained by deleting 2 2( 1)N L− +  columns 
from Q . It is thus of full column rank whenever Q  is nonsingular and, if so, the 
product channel coefficients can be computed via 
 ( ) 1( ) ( (1))T Tvec vec−= yH Q Q Q R   .  (4.8) 
Compared with the direct matrix inversion method (4.3), the solution (4.8) can yield 
better estimation accuracy at the expense of computational complexity (see Appendix 
B for complexity evaluation). Based on (4.3) and (4.8), the selection of precoder 
( )p n  for optimal numerical robustness is discussed next. 
 
 22
 
A. Minimal Worst-Case Sensitivity to Error Perturbation 
 
  We will first treat w  as an unknown “deterministic” perturbation since the 
statistical property of the data estimation error is in general difficult to characterize. 
From this standpoint, typical solution robustness measures for (5.3) and (5.4) are the 
condition numbers of the matrices Q  and Q , respectively (see, e.g., [18] and [23]). 
Small ( )κ Q  and ( )κ Q , in particular, are known to ensure small worst-case 
sensitivity of the error-perturbed solution to data mismatch [18, p-338]. Since both Q  
and Q  depend entirely on ( )p n , a natural approach to improving the channel 
estimation accuracy is to choose ( )p n  so that both ( )κ Q  and ( )κ Q  are kept as 
small as possible. This type of optimization problem would seem formidable to tackle 
since the condition number of a matrix is in general a highly nonlinear function in the 
entries. Toward a tractable design formulation, we note the crucial fact: since Q  
contains a subset of columns of Q  (see (4.6)), it follows [23, p-27] 
 ( ) ( )κ κ≤Q Q .  (5.5) 
Inequality (5.5) suggests that, to jointly improve the accuracy of solutions (5.3) and 
(5.4), it is plausible to just minimize ( )κ Q  because a small ( )κ Q  will also 
guarantee ( )κ Q  to be small. Such a design strategy, on the one hand, can bypass 
direct minimization of ( )κ Q  which would appear rather intractable. More 
importantly, it will allow us to exploit the eigenvalue characteristics of the BCCB 
matrix Q  (in Theorem 4.1) to analytically derive a solution, as is shown below. 
Hence, we specifically propose to minimize ( )κ Q , subject to the following two 
 24
eigenvalues which, according to Theorem 4.1, are exactly the maximum and 
minimum among the N  elements { }, | , , | 1| (1) | ( ) | ( ) |Nω ω −p p p" , where ( )zp  is 
the polynomial defined in (4.2). More precisely, we have 
 
max ( )
( )
min ( )
k
k
ωκ ω=

Q
p
, for 0 1k N≤ ≤ − .  (5.9) 
To find the minimal ( )κ Q  based on (5.9), we shall further characterize ( )kωp ’s 
under the two constraints in (5.6). With (5.6a), it is easy to see from (4.2) that, for 
0k = ,

The following lemma provides an upper bound on ( )kωp  for 1 1k N≤ ≤ − ; the 
result is crucial for deriving the minimal ( )κ Q  (the proof of lemma is shown in 
Appendix C). 
 
Lemma 5.1: For any ( )p n  satisfying (5.6a) and (5.6b), we have 
 ( ) (1 )k Nω δ≤ −p  for all 1 1k N≤ ≤ − .  (5.11) 
   
 
With (5.9), (5.10), and (5.11), the minimal achievable ( )κ Q , and the corresponding 
optimal ( )p n , are shown in the following theorem. 
 
Theorem 5.2: Under the constraints (5.6a) and (5.6b), the minimal condition number 
associated with the matrix Q  is given by

The proof is thus completed.              
 
  Theorem 5.2 shows that min( )κ Q  depends entirely on the minimal power threshold 
δ , irrespective of the dimension of Q  (and hence the symbol block length N ). A 
small δ , in particular, is seen to yield small min( )κ Q  and thus improves the channel 
estimation accuracy. 
 
B. Minimization of Mean Square Error 
 
  In this subsection, we alternatively formulate w  as a zero-mean white noise 
vector with covariance matrix 2wσ I , and resort to the well-known minimum mean 
square error principle, see, e.g., [6], for constructing a solution. Although a theoretical 
justification of such statistical data error assumption is difficult to establish, our 
simulation study does confirm this tendency. 
 
  Since w  is white, the mean square errors incurred by solutions (5.3) and (5.4) are, 
respectively, 
 ( )

and 
 ( )2 12ˆ( ) ( ) HwE vec vec Trσ −⎡ ⎤− = ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦H H Q Q
    (5.19) 
Toward an utmost reduction of the white noise effect, the precoder ( )p n  should thus 
 28
 ( ) ( )1 1H HTr Tr− −⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤≤⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦M M M M .  (5.23) 
  
  Lemma 5.3 asserts ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q
   is upper bounded by ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q . This thus 
suggests a suboptimal, but would be more simple and efficient, way of precoder 
design: we can simply choose ( )p n  to minimize ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q , since 
( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q
   would in turn be kept small. The main advantage of the proposed 
design formulation, as expected, is that we can directly take profit of the BCCB 
property of Q  to derive a closed-form solution. Indeed, since ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q  is the 
sum of the eigenvalues associated with ( ) 1H −Q Q  which, according to Theorem 4.1, 
are exactly the N  replicas of the N -tuple { }2

Equation (5.24) rewrites ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q  in terms of ( )
nωp ’s; we can then further 
exploit equation (5.10) and Lemma 5.1 to construct an optimal solution, as is shown 
in the next theorem. 
 
Theorem 5.4: The optimal ( )p n  minimizing ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q , subject to constraints 
(5.6a) and (5.6b), is the two-level solution (5.13). The resultant minimal mean square

objective functions ( )κ Q  and ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q  are quite different in nature, the 
respective minimizing solutions, under constraints (5.6a) and (5.6b), are the same 
the two-level form choice (5.13); this is due to the BCCB property of the matrix 
Q . 
(b) The two-level solution (5.13) minimizes both ( )κ Q  and ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q , but its 
optimality with respect to ( )κ Q  and ( ) 1HTr −⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦Q Q
   appears intractable to verify. 
Our simulation results seem to indicate that it is indeed the minimizing solution. 
(c) Since ( ) ( )κ κ≤Q Q  and ( ) ( )1 1H HTr Tr− −⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤≤⎢ ⎥ ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦ ⎣ ⎦Q Q Q Q
  , solution (5.4) can yield 
better estimation accuracy than (5.3); numerical simulations (see Simulation 2) 
also evidence this tendency. 
(d) The optimal solution (5.13) does not depend on the index m  at which the peak 
power occurs: any 0 1m N≤ ≤ −  allows for an utmost mitigation for data 
estimation error. However, since the trailing components in each symbol block 
will be duplicated as CP, the peak power in (5.13) should not be located within the 
corresponding index region so as to conserve the power resource. 
(e) In the study of single channel blind identification via modulation-induced- 
cyclostationarity, the two-level sequence (5.13) is shown to be optimal for 
mitigating the channel noise effect for the serial transmission case [10], [24], and 
also for the FDE based block transmission [37].

induced power variation, therefore, will incur a loss in the decision performance. The 
precoder (5.13), however, turns out to be the worst-case choice, as can be seen from 
the following theorem (see Appendix E for a proof).

  Based on (6.7), simple manipulation shows the maximum value, when viewed as a 
function of δ , will increase as δ  is decreased. As a result, a small δ , although 
improving channel estimation accuracy, will enlarge the PEP upper bound in (6.5), 
and hence bring potentially poor equalization performance. This thus imposes a 
tradeoff in selecting δ ; our simulation study (see Simulation 5) indicates that 
0.7 0.8δ = ∼  are the compromising choices. 
 
 34
 
0.6δ = , we consider the optimal sequence (5.13) and another sub-optimal choice 
given as 2( ) 0.6p n =  for 0 15n≤ ≤  and 2( ) 1.4p n =  for 16 31n≤ ≤ . Figure 
2 shows the computed NMSE with various numbers of symbol blocks K (the product 
channel coefficients are computed via (5.4)). It can be seen that the optimal solution 
(5.13) significantly improves the performance. 
Simulation 2-Performance Comparison of Solutions (5.3) and (5.4): This simulation 
compares the estimation performance of solutions (5.3) and (5.4). Figure 3 shows the 
respective NMSE, versus number of symbol blocks, for three power thresholds δ : 
0.3 , 0.6 , and 0.92  (SNR is fixed at 10 dB). The result shows that the performances  
of the two methods are very close for 0.3δ =  and 0.6; however, solution (5.4) 
seems to yield smaller NMSE when 0.92δ = . This is because, for 0.3δ =  and 
0.6 , the associated condition number pair ( )( ), ( )κ κQ Q  are (1.4286,1.1370)  and  
 36
 
Simulation 4-Estimation Performance Against Blind Subspace Method with Transmit 
Redundancy [40]: This simulation compares channel estimation performances of the 
proposed scheme with the identical-precoder subspace method [40, p-1218], in which 
FFT precoding matrix is adopted to convert the multi-carrier scheme into 
single-carrier FDE-STBC systems considered in this paper. To implement the 
algorithm in [40], the last 8 entries in each symbol block are set to be zero; this 
introduces the minimal amount of transmit redundancy for fulfilling the associated 
channel identifiability condition (cf. [40, p-1218]). For fixed SNR= 10 dB, Figure 5 
shows the computed NMSE versus number of symbol blocks; the proposed method, 
depicted with solid lines, is implemented with various choices of δ . We can first see 
from the figure that the performance of the proposed method is improved as δ  
decreases: this is because small δ  results in small ( )κ Q , and also reduces the mean 
square error incurred by  
 38
 
Figure 6 shows the NMSE of the two methods at different SNR levels ( 500K = ). 
The result shows that, in the medium-to-low SNR region, our method performs better 
even with the moderate choice 0.7δ = . When SNR increases, the output NMSE of 
[40] exhibits a fast decay. This is not unexpected since the method [40] is 
“deterministic” in nature: it benefits from the finite-sample-convergence property, and 
can usually yield impressive estimation accuracy when SNR is high [31]. A similar 
tendency is also observed in [31, p-1942] when non-redundant diagonal precoding 
based identification is compared with the (deterministic) multi-channel subspace 
methods [29] and [38]. 
Simulation 5-On Selection of Power Threshold δ : This simulation considers the 
optimal precoder (5.13) and illustrates the impact of δ  on equalization performance. 
Figure 7 shows the bit-error-rate (BER) curves for 0.1 0.9δ≤ ≤ ; we set 500K = , 
1000I = , and use frequency-domain ZF equalizer [15] for symbol recovery. It can

constellation). Figure 8 shows the BER results of the three methods at different SNR 
levels ( 500K =  and 1000I = ); the known channel case is also included as the 
benchmark performance. The proposed method, as we can see, leads to the lowest 
BER. The performance advantage over the training method [11] would come from the 
reduction of number of unknowns from 2( 1)L +  to three: this would further 
smoothen the noise effect and thus improve performance. In contrast with [40], our 
method yields about a 3~4 dB SNR gain; this benefits from the non-redundant 
transmission of the proposed scheme: for a target data rate one can otherwise use 
lower order constellations to buy more BER floor margin. Finally we observe that, 
compared with the known channel case, our method seems to incur no more than 1 
dB penalty. We repeat the above experiment with the exponential delay power profile 
channel model [30]. Figure 9 shows the resultant BER curves, which are seen to 
exhibit a similar tendency as in the  
 42
 
optimal pilot sequence designed in [11] is placed in the initial symbol block pair per 
sub-burst, for training based estimation as well as for ambiguity removal in the two 
blind schemes; for the transmit-redundancy based solution [40], symbol constellations 
are likewise loaded for comparison under a fixed data rate. Figure 10 shows the 
respective BER curves (averaged over 2000I =  trials). Compared with the 
quasi-static case (Figures 8 and 9), the performances of the three methods degrade 
due to the time-varying channel characteristic; the proposed method, still, leads to the 
lowest error rate. 
 
Simulation 8-On PAPR Performance: This simulation investigates the PAPR results 
when the optimal precoder (5.13) is used. For the considered system parameters 
( 32N = , 8L = ) and with Nyquist pulse shaping filter, the values of PAPR for 
various choices of δ  with respect to different symbol constellations are tabulated in 
[37, p-1124]. The results show that the two-level precoder (5.13) does increase PAPR  
 44
the incurred instantaneous PAPR is also observed when different symbol 
constellations are used. As a result, with moderate choices of δ , the proposed 
optimal precoder (5.13) does not seem to induce a large power back-off in practice. It 
is noted that, although the instantaneous PAPR will increase when δ  falls below 0.7, 
small δ  should be precluded for maintaining the BER performance (see Figure 7).

compares favorably with existing training and blind methods fitted for FDE-STBC 
systems.

assuming that the noise components ,{ , }n q v  in (2.3) are 
mutually independent and the respective samples in ’s, iq ’s,
and iv ’s are also independent across sensors, the parameter R

A commonly used statistical description for sensing noise 
variance is [7], [13]: 
2
i izT E B  , 1 i Nb b ,      (2.6) 
where E  models the network-wide noise variance threshold, 
B  controls the underlying variation from the nominal 
minimum, and 21iz D  are i.i.d. central Chi-Square 
distributed random variables each with degrees-of-freedom 
equal to one [6, p-24]. The proposed energy-constrained 
MMSE decentralized estimation scheme is based on the noise 
variance model (2.6) and is discussed next. 
III. MAIN RESULTS 
A. Problem Setup 
We assume that the ith sensor sends the ib -bit message im
by using QAM with a constellation size 2 ib . The consumed 
energy is thus [2], [13],  
	 
2 1ibi iE w   for some iw , 1 i Nb b ;   (3.1) 
the energy density iw  is defined as [2] 
	 
: ln 2/ii i bw d PLS ¸ ,             (3.2) 
in which S  is a constant depending on the noise profile, id
is the distance between the ith node and the FC, iL  is the ith
path loss exponent, and bP  is the target bit error rate assumed 
common to all sensor-to-FC links. With (2.5) and (3.1), the 
energy allocated to the ith sensor is thus determined by the 
number of quantization bits ib . For a fixed set of sensing noise 
variances 2iT ’s, the problem of MMSE decentralized 
estimation, under an allowable total energy budget TE , can be 
formulated as 
a. As in [1], [7], and [13] we assume orthogonal channel access among 
all the sensor-to-fusion links, which can be realized via, e.g., TDMA or 
CDMA with orthogonal spreading.

The optimization problem (3.7) appears rather formidable to 
tackle because the cost function is highly nonlinear in ib . In 
what follows we will propose an alternative formulation which 
is more tractable and can yield an analytic solution. 
B. Alternative Formulation 
  The proposed approach is grounded on the following 
approximation to ()Q ¸  function [8, p-115]:

;   (3.8) 
the approximation (3.8) is quite accurate since the peak relative 
error is less than 1.2%  for 0x p , and is almost identical to 
zero whenever 5x p . Based on (3.8) together with some 
straightforward manipulations, the cost function in (3.7) can be 
well approximated by
