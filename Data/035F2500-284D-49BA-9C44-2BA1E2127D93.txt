transceiver would be achieved while maintaining 
reasonable performances. 
    During the two-years, a 60 GHz power amplifier, a 
60 GHz low noise amplifier, a 60 GHz mixer, a 60 GHz 
modulator/demodulator, and a 60 GHz highly integrated 
transceiver MMICs have been designed, fabricated, and 
implemented on 0.13-μm, and 90 nm CMOS process. The 
chips were fabricated by TSMC Semiconductors 
Corporation through the Chip Implementation Center 
(CIC). In addition, the DC power consumption of these 
key components of the transceiver is analyzed. 
Furthermore, different low-voltage operation and low-
power consumption technologies for different property 
of the components including power amplifier, low 
noise amplifier, mixer, modulator/demodulator, and 
transceiver are proposed.  Finally, these MMICs have 
been designed, fabricated, and measured through the 
Chip Implementation Center (CIC). Most of the results 
have been published in SCI journal and EI 
international conference paper [1]-[4].

 III. 60-GHZ PA DESIGN 
Although the transistor frequency response of the 130nm 
CMOS is inferior to advanced 90nm CMOS technique at V-
band, well device size selection and efficiency power combine 
scheme are adopted to achieve this 130nm V-band DAT PA 
design. The larger transistor size must be selected for power 
performance; however, the frequency response degrades.  
Therefore, compromise must be made to obtain sufficient 
gain performance for the V-band PA design. In this work, we 
choose the transistor of 28 fingers with a total gate periphery 
of 84 μm (each with 3-μm unit finger length). Furthermore, if 
we want to achieve larger saturation power, the power 
combine scheme is adopted. In this paper, the DAT structure 
concurrently performs multi-way power combination and 
impedance transformation [3] in millimeter-wave PA design.  
Figure 2 shows the whole block diagram of this V-band 
130nm CMOS DAT PA. Adopting three-stage cascode 
configuration provides high gain results at 60 GHz. The size 
ratio of these three stages is 1:2:4. First and second stages are 
driver amplifiers, and the third stage is composed of four 
identical power amplifier units performing four-time power 
combining mechanism. The impedance tuning and 
transforming characteristics are formed between baluns and 
DAT [6]. Therefore, the input and output matching stubs can 
be simplified in PA block compared to DA block at first two 
stages. Figure 3 illustrates the detailed schematic of output 
DAT and four PA units at final stage. Primary loop is 
consisted of thickened metal 8 in this 130nm CMOS process 
and the secondary loop is consisted of metal 7. These two 
loops are placed in broadside-coupled manner in order to 
render high coupling coefficient at V-band frequency. 
Capacitors C1 and C2 added in primary loop to perform 
impedance tuning feature. The capacitors C3 and C4 are used 
to re-confirm second harmonic short for good linearity [5]. 
Figure 4 shows the chip photograph of the V-band CMOS 
DAT PA with chip size of 0.8 x 0.85 mm2 including all 
testing pads and dummy metal.

IV. MEASURED RESULTS 
A.  LNA Measurement Results 
The 60-GHz LNA chip was measured through on-wafer 
probing. Figure 5 shows the measured S-parameter and noise 
figure from 50 to 70 GHz at 2.4V drain bias with total current 
of 28 mA. The amplifier has 1dB flat gain from 56-64 GHz 
with a peak gain of 20.5 dB at 62.7 GHz. The minimum input 
and output return losses are -24 and -11.8 dB, respectively. 
The measured noise figure at the same bias condition exhibits 
a minimum of 6.9 dB at 60 GHz. Figure 6 shows the input 
1dB compression point (P1dB) is –23 dBm and the saturated 
output power is 3.8 dBm at 60 GHz.

the resonator, the core of ILFD is the current-reused structure 
which replaces one of the NMOS cross-coupled transistors of 
a conventional ILFD with a PMOS transistor. The supply 
current IDC flow from VDD, PMOS (M2), L1, and reused by 
NMOS (M1) to ground. This structure is widely used in 
oscillator and amplifier designs [6]. It can be also 
implemented in frequency dividers to reduce the supply 
current by half. Due to the different mobility of PMOS and 
NMOS, the size of PMOS is three times larger than the size of 
NMOS. BPF is implemented by L1 and parasitic capacitor of 
transistors. M3 is a passive mixer. To enhance the locking 
range and transconductance of M3, the peaking inductor Lpeak 
is serialized with M3 [1].  
The simplified circuit model of the proposed ILFD is 
shown in Fig. 2. The summation of the injected current, Iinj, 
and current of the resonator, Io, generates current Ir flowing 
through cross-coupled pair. The phasor diagram of the 
simplified model of ILFD is shown in Fig. 3 [7], [8]. When 
output is locked by the input signal and oscillating at half 
input frequency, the phase shift φα and φβ cancel each other to 
satisfy Barkhausen’s criteria where φα is the phase shift of 
mixer, φβ is the phase shift of the resonator. When the output 
frequency is higher/lower than the resonant frequency fr of the 
tank, the phase of Io leads/lags the phase of Vp. To compensate 
the phase shift of BPF, the Iinj must lag/lead the VP so the 
mixer acts like an inductor/capacitor [9], [10]. Therefore, the 
proposed ILFD can be modeled by electrical components as 
shown in Fig. 4. The locking range of the divide-by-2 ILFD is

, where H0 is the maximum value of H(ω), Q is the quality 
factor of H(ω), ωr is resonant frequency and gm2 is the 
nonlinear coefficient of the drain-pumped transistor as 
following equation: 
2 3
1 2 3d m i m i m ii g v g v g v= + +  
To enhance the locking range, the input voltage swing, vi, 
and nonlinear coefficient, gm2, need to be increasing. By 
analysing the nonlinear coefficient, the peaking inductance 
can be chosen for optimum value. The Fig. 5 shows the 
simulated second-ordered nonlinear coefficient versus bias 
voltage of mixer with different peaking inductance. The gm2 
increases with peaking inductance. However, the inductance 
has upper limit as the chip area and the resonant frequency are 
taking into consideration. The VGS of mixer and the peaking 
inductance are chosen 0.6 V and 0.3 nH in this design.

 IV. CONCLUSIONS 
A 20.5-to-26 GHz injection-locked frequency divider has 
been designed, fabricated, and measured in a 0.18-µm CMOS 
process. The proposed circuit consists of a series inductive 
peaking and current-reused structure that demonstrates low-
power consumption and wide-locking-range performance at 
K-band. Via the incident signal power of 0 dBm, an input 
locking range of 5.5GHz (23.6 %) is achieved while 
maintaining low-power consumption of 1.5 mW. The VCO 
and ILFD using current-reused core is also fabricated and 
measured. The total power consumption of the PLL front-end 
is 11.5 mW with operating frequency from 22.7 to 23.3 GHz 
and it is suitable for low-power system.

selection of the linearizer is important. To understand the 
characteristic of transistor under different bias conditions, the 
nonlinear equation is analyzed. The output current respect to 
input voltage of a MOS transistor is listed below: 
2 3
1 2 3d m gs m gs m gsi g v g v g v= + + +⋅⋅⋅  
The first three coefficients are taking into consideration for 
simplicity [5]. The gm1 is the derivative of output current 
respective to input voltage. The gm2 and gm3 are the second 
and third derivative respectively. The IIP3 is impacted by gm3 
seriously as IIP3 = |4 gm1 / 3 gm3|1/2. The simulated nonlinear 
characteristics of the 0.18-μm CMOS at 24GHz is shown in 
Fig. 3. The VGS of MA and MB are selected 0.75 V and 0.4 V 
respectively in this design for the following reasons: (1) The 
gm3 is out of phase at these two bias conditions hence the IM3 
is improved after superposition; (2) These two biases have 
smaller gm2 compared to the IM3-free point hence they are 
more linear; (3) The gain and NF are good due to the higher 
gm1 when the VGS of MA is 0.75 V; (4) The power 
consumption of linearizer is negligible when the VGS of MB is 
0.4 V. From simulation, the linearizer consumes less than 0.1 
mA.  
The DS linearization technique for LNA is performed well 
at low frequency, at 900 MHz [4], which the parasitic 
capacitance of the parallel transistor is negligible. As the 
operating frequency above 20 GHz, the parasitic capacitance 
of transistor impact the linearity of DS technique. To reduce 
the impact of Cgs, the presented LNA uses the source-sensed 
technique [5]. The source-sensed technique senses the input 
signal from the source of the common source amplifier rather 
than from gate. To eliminate the effect of Cds, the distributed 
DS design is introduced. A compensation transmission line 
TL1 absorbs Cds to meet the out-of-phase condition of the IM3 
power at the output of the LNA and linearizer. It also 
achieves good matching network at the same time. With the 
same device size of three-stage amplifier, the third-order 
intercept point of cascaded amplifier is dominated by the last 
stage [10]. Therefore, the proposed linearizer is incorporated 
at the last stage. In addition, the linearizer contributes less 
noise to the overall NF. However, the output return loss is 
changed when the linearizer is turned on/off. This is not a 
problem since the linearizer is always turned on when it is 
integrated in front-end. 
The LNA MMIC is fabricated using TSMC 0.18-μm 
MS/RF CMOS technology with one poly and six metal layers. 
This technology provides a fT and fmax of better than 60 and 55 
GHz, respectively. The transmission lines utilize thin-film 
microstrip structures to reduce losses on lossy silicon 
substrate. Fig. 4 shows the photograph of the LNA chip with 
a chip size of 0.52 × 0.53 mm2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
III. MEASUREMENT RESULT 
The measurements of the LNA MMIC are taken directly 
using wafer probes. The total dc power consumption is 18 
mW from 1.8 V supply voltage. As shown in the Fig. 5, the 
MMIC achieves a measured small signal gain of 12.2 ± 1.5 
dB from 20.9 GHz to 24.8 GHz, with gain of 12.1 dB at 24 
GHz and peak gain of 13.7 dB at 22.3 GHz. In addition, the 
measured S21 increases 0.9 dB at 22.3 GHz when the 
linearizer is turned on. The input and output return losses are 
better than 20 dB at 24 GHz. The measured noise figure is 
plotted in Fig. 6 with NF of 3.8 dB at 24 GHz. The NF is 
slightly degraded when the linearizer is turned on. The 
measured input P1dB is -8 dBm at 24 GHz when the linearizer

techniques, the linearized LNA shows the IIP3 improvement 
of 5.3 dB and the IM3 is improved up to 10.6 dB at the input

shifter which provide a discrete phase change of 180°by 
controlling the dc voltage Vc180 on or off.  
A. 180°Reflection type phase shifter design 
Circuit design of the reflection type phase shifter is 
described in Fig. 1. It is constructed utilizing a compact 
quadrature coupler topology terminated by two identical 
reflection loads. The quadrature coupler was implemented 
with thin-film microstrip (TFMS) lines on the thick SiO2 layer 
to avoid the lossy silicon substrate. Fig.2 is the architecture of 
the three dimension quadrature coupler with an area of 136 × 
60 μm2. It use broadside couple to achieve a better coupling 
coefficient and was simulated by full-wave EM simulator 
(Sonnet). The phase tuning range of reflection type phase 
shifter is determined by the reactance tuning range of 
reflection load. Fig. 3 is a proposed π-type C-L-C load which 
is used to achieve 180
0
 continuous phase tuning in the RTPS. 
The effective reactance can be varied from inductive to 
capacitive over the varactor tuning range to achieve desired 
phase shift variation. The impedance trajectory on the smith 
chart is shown in Fig. 3. The simulation frequency is 24 GHz 
and the control voltage of the varactor is from -0.5 to 0.8 V. 
In order to minimize the loss and achieve 180
0
 degree phase 
shift, the two varactor size of the proposed π-type C-L-C load 
are chosen differently to match to 50 Ω and to avoid the 
impedance trajectory run inside the smith chart.

Fig. 3.   Impedance trajectory on the smith chart. 
B. 180°switch type phase shifter design [5] [8] 
Fig. 4 shows the circuit schematic of the switch phase 
shifter and its simplified circuit model. When M1 is off and 
M2 is on called the phase shift state neglecting the parasitic 
capacitance of M1 and the on resistance of M2, Ls1 and Cp1 
form a low pass pi network shown in Fig. 4(b) with phase 
shift 0 01sin ( )sL Z  [5]. The component value Ls and 
Cp1 are designed according to the desired phase shift   and 
characteristic impedance Z0. The nonzero on resistance of M2 
has a minimum impact on the insertion phase of the phase 
shift state and matching of the circuit. However, it will 
increase the insertion loss of the phase shift state. A low pass 
pi network can provide up to 90∘phase shift while being 
matched at the desired frequency. Therefore, to provide a 180
∘phase shift, two identical switch type phase shifter shown in 
Fig. 4(a) is connected in series. When M1 is on and M2 is off 
called the reference state, inductor LR is sized to resonate with 
the off parasitic capacitance of M2, which places the Ls and 
Cp/2 in parallel with the on resistance of M1 as shown in Fig. 
4(c). The reactance of Ls in parallel with Cp/2 is designed to 
be larger than Ron1 thus it has little impact on the insertion 
phase and the reference state can be modeled as a simple 
series resistor. Therefore, the insertion loss of the reference 
state is determined by the size of M1. The design procedure is 
summarized as follows. First, the component value of Ls and 
Cp1 is determined by the desired phase shift   thus the 
insertion loss of the phase shift state is primarily determined. 
Second, the size of M2 is chosen large enough to reduce the 
on-resistance thus it can reduce the insertion loss of the phase 
shift state to a level and the inductor value LR must be 
reduced accordingly so as to resonate the off capacitance of 
M2 at the desired frequency when in the reference state. 
Finally, the size of M1 is chosen to let the insertion loss of the 
reference state be the same as the phase shift state but the off 
capacitance of M1 will in parallel with the capacitance Cp1 
causing the phase in the phase shift state to deviate. Therefore, 
iteration of the process is necessary.

IV. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents a low insertion loss variation phase 
shifter at 22 GHz in standard 0.18-μm CMOS technology. 
With no power consumption, this phase shifter achieves 336
∘ continuously tuning range at 22 GHz with maximum 
insertion loss 16 dB and loss variation only 1.3 dB. The phase 
shift range can cover over 330∘from 21-25 GHz. Table I 
summarizes the performances of the presented phase shifter 
and other reported data. As can be observed, our MMIC 
demonstrates lowest insertion loss variation while 
maintaining comparable performances.

transconductance stage also makes the supply voltage of 
CML unsuitable in low-supply-voltage applications. The 
proposed low-supply-voltage CML is shown in Fig. 2. The 
current source and the transconductance stage of the CML 
divider are removed. The inductor L1,2 provide the dc current 
path and the proper matching network. Moreover, the swing 
at the input port can be lower than the ground hence it is 
suitable for low-voltage and high swing application.  
B. Injection-Locked Frequency Divider with 
Admittance-Transforming Technique 
The block diagram of ILFD is shown in Fig. 3 (a). The 
input signal is mixed with the output signal then generates 
two frequencies, fin+fout and fin-fout. The fin+fout signal is 
filtered by the band-pass filter (BPF) hence the frequency 
ratio of input and output is two. The conventional 
implementation of ILFD is shown in Fig. 3(b). The mixer is a 
transistor biased at the resistive region. The cross coupled 
pair provide the negative conductance to make the circuit 
oscillated. The parasitic capacitance of transistor and the 
inductor forms the BPF. This kind of implementation has 
narrow locking range problem. To widen the locking range, 
the parameters which impact the locking range are needed. 
The locking range equation is shown in the following 
equation [3]:

ωΔ <  
, where H0 is the maximum value of H(ω), Q is the quality 
factor of H(ω), ωr is resonant frequency and gm2 is the 
nonlinear coefficient of the drain-pumped transistor. From the 
equation, the locking range is proportional to the input swing, 
the gm2, the inductance of the resonator (H0/Q = ωL ∝ L ∝ 
1/C). Therefore, the proposed ILFD try to eliminate the 
parasitic capacitance to widen the locking range [3]. 
The proposed ILFD uses the admittance-transforming 
technique [1] [2] to eliminate the parasitic capacitance of 
passive mixer, Cmixer, and the cross-coupled pair, Ccross. The 
admittance-transforming technique is shown in the Fig. 4. 
The input admittance can be transformed as shown in the 
following equations [2]:

, the Y0 is the characteristic admittance of transmission line 
and the Gp, Cp is the parasitic conductance and capacitance. If

The admittance becomes a real number (the imaginary part of 
admittance is zero). Therefore, the admittance-transforming 
ILFD can operate wide bandwidth due to the parasitic 
capacitance can be eliminated. The proposed 
admittance-transforming ILFD is shown in Fig. 5. The 
parasitic effect of passive mixer and cross-coupled pair is 
transformed by transmission line, TL1,2 and TL3,4. The 
inductance is made by transmission line, too. Therefore, the 
transmission lines can be meandered to reduce the chip area.

 The dc level of their gate is 0.9 V. Since the arbitrary 
waveform generator (AWG) which is used to produce IF 
signals only supplies a limited dc level, level shifters are 
needed to convert the 0-V dc level of IF input signal to about 
0.9 V at the gate of M5 and M6. The level shifters are source 
followers consist of M3, M4 (16μm/0.13μm/PMOS), R3, and 
R4 (600 Ω). M7-M10 (16μm/0.13μm) form current 
commutating stage. R1 and R2 (600 Ω) are current injection 
resistors which reduces the current flowing through the 
commutating stage while keeping sufficient current for the 
trans-conductance stage. The differential RF signal is 
combined with a balun to generate single-ended signal. L1 and 
L2 are inductors for broadband matching network [6]. The 
inductance is 0.25 nH with self-resonance frequency at 140 
GHz, and the quality-factor is about 6.5. 
B. Quadrature Power Splitter 
The schematic of quadrature power splitter are shown in Fig. 
3. The microstrip transmission lines are implemented with 
thin-film microstrip lines (TFMS). The Wilkinson power 
divider is designed with center frequency of 80 GHz to 
minimize the length of the λ/4 transmission line. The HPF 
section is implemented by the unit-cell shown in Fig. 4. The 
capacitance of the HPF section for this design is only 0.15 pF, 
which is very small and may be very sensitive to process 
variation. Since the capacitances are critical design parameters 
which influence the phase performance of the broadband QPS 
drastically, to reduce the effect of process variation, two 
capacitors of 0.3 pF are series connected to form a 0.15 pF 
capacitor. The inductor is implemented by a short stub with 
characteristic impedance of 72 Ω. The LPF section is 
implemented by TFMS with characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. 
Cascade the HPF and LPF sections to the Wilkinson power 
divider and the simulated output phase difference is shown in 
Fig.5.

III. CONCLUSION 
    A broadband modulator integrated with HPF/LPF 
quadrature power splitter is designed, fabricated, and 
measured. The total power consumption is 39 mW. The 
MMIC achieves a conversion gain of -6.5 to -2 dB from 50 to 
70 GHz. The highest sideband suppression is 35 dBc at 54 
GHz. From 52.5 to 55.5, sideband suppression better than 30 
dBc is achieved. Via HPF/LPF quadrature power splitter, 
sideband suppression is better than 19 dBc from 50 to 75 GHz. 
The LO-to-RF isolation is 36 to 45 dB. This is the first CMOS 
modulator with quadrature power splitter using HPF/LPF 
concept to improve the sideband suppression.

II. CIRCUIT DESIGN 
The topology of the designed RTPS is shown in Fig. 1. 
The two resonated loads attached to the coupled and 
through ports of a quadrature coupler. The phase shift 
between input and isolated (output) ports will varies with 
the load reactance. 
Fig. 2 illustrates the layout of  the quadrature hybrid, 
with an area of 0.22 x 0.12 mm2, used for the phase shifter 
is realized with broadside couplers are composed of two 
parallel microstrip lines (Metal layers 5 and 6) which are 
positioned at the different layers in standard 0.18µm 
CMOS technology. Simulated results show that the 
proposed broadside coupler accomplishes the average 
coupling for the direct and coupled ports is 3.7 dB 
between 3–5 GHz. The phase difference between the 
direct and coupled ports is approximately 90∘with an 
error within 1 o in the desired band. Fig. 3 illustrates the 
schematic diagram of the proposed reflection loads.  The 
two resonated loads of the proposed RTPS are using one 
active inductor to substitute the large inductor (~4.5nH) 
for compact size design, and one small passive inductor 
(~1.5nH) for low-power design. Compared with other 
reported 360∘C-band CMOS RTPS, the proposed phase 
shifter has the smallest die size. Furthermore, it also has 
superior power consumption compared with the active 
phase shifters using fully integrated active circulator [1], 
or active inductor [2].

For RF applications, the regulated cascode topology is 
commonly used in the design of CMOS active inductors 
[5].  In this configuration, the gain boosting transistor M3 
is utilized as negative feedback to enhance the quality 
factor of the active inductor. To achieve high quality factor, 
we will modify the active inductor by adding one 
resistor fR  in the feedback path [6]. Hence, a low power 
consumption and high quality factor active inductor is 
implemented, shown in Fig. 4. Based on the simulated 
results, table I summarizes the performances of the active 
and passive inductors. The active inductors 1L  exhibit 
equivalent inductances of 4.5nH with a high quality factor 
more than 100 and a 1.7mW dc power consumption at 4-
GHz band. Compared with the same passive inductance 
(~4.5nH), the active inductor achieves low loss and 
compact chip area simultaneously.

SUMMARY  PERFORMANCE 
IV. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents a 3.5-4.5-GHz ultra compact 
reflection-type 360∘phase shifter in standard 0.18-µm 
CMOS technology. Using the dual active reflection load, 
the RTPS achieves 360∘phase range in one RTPS stage 
with chip size of 0.25 mm2 including all testing pads. The 
phase shift range can cover full band 360∘from 3.5-4.5 
GHz with signal losses of 6.4dB±1.5dB and less than 
2.4dB±0.6 dB loss variation. Table II summarizes the 
performances of the presented phase shifter below 5GHz. 
Although the active phase shifter [1], [2], [7] has low 
insertion low with compact size, the large power 
consumption is not suitable for low-power phase array 
system. The traditional RTPS has zero power consumption, 
but the high insertion loss and large chip size is the 
drawback [8]-[10]. Under the considerations of the dc 
power consumption and the chip area, the proposed 
reflection-type phase shifter using active reflection load has 
compact chip size and low power consumption while 
maintaining reasonable insertion loss, which is suitable for 
phase array system application.
