optical effect of large-scale structures as they 
exist in shear layer development, nor how these 
effects may be controlled. We are studying the 
optical effects of large scale structures in forced 
and unforced situations using periodic motion 
of a small flap at the trailing edge of the splitter 
plate. 
In order to understand the optical properties of 
the shear layers, it is necessary to understand 
their basic fluid mechanics. Many recent 
experiments have confirmed that large-scale 
coherent structures are indeed intrinsic features 
of a plane mixing layer over a wide range of 
Reynolds numbers [1,2]. The plane mixing 
layer consists of an array of large eddies of 
concentrated span wise vorticity. These 
quasi-two-dimensional large eddies are 
responsible for the transport of mass and 
momentum. In the past, the investigation of 
shear layer optical properties were based on the 
assumptions of homogeneous turbulence. There 
has been no study of the optical effects of 
large-scale structures which exist during the 
course of shear layer development. One 
purpose of this work is to identify the optical 
effects of coherent structures. It is also known 
from experiments that the shear layer flow 
pattern can be altered easily by introducing 
external perturbations near the point of initial 
mixing [3,4]. Since the spreading rate and the 
density profile (related to the index of 
refraction distribution) can be changed 
drastically by perturbing at a particular 
frequency with appropriate amplitude, another 
purpose of this research is to seek out the 
method of improving optical performance in 
the far-field by controlling of the mixing layer. 
The basic vortex dynamics in a shear layer are 
essentially inviscid. However, to simulate a 
free or forced shear layer numerically, 3-D 
Navier-Stokes equations are solved by 
alternating the MacCormack explicit, predictor- 
corrector and Godunov scheme [5,6]. The 3-D 
Navier-Stokes equations can be solved directly 
and the density fields obtained are used for 
shear layer optical property studies.

It has been shown that in order to resolve the 
large-scale structures in a mixing layer, 
unsteady boundary conditions must be applied 
[10]. In this case, at the inlet plane, a periodic 
forcing is introduced to simulate the “natural” 
mixing layer. The forcing frequencies consist 
of the fundamental frequency and the first three 
subharmonics of the shear layer. The 
fundamental frequency satisfies the Strothal 
number criterion which is derived from 
Rayleigh’s inviscid, linear stability theory [11]. 
In this case, the fundamental frequency is 
4.227KHZ. Furthermore, the forcing is 
modified by incorporating random phases to 
the Rayleigh modes to simulate random pairing 
of two neighboring vortices [12]. 
To advance the code in one time step t∆ , the 
numerical stability condition must be applied 
[5,6]. During this time interval, t∆ , waves 
from neighboring Riemann problems will not 
interact with each other. In our calculations, 
y ,x ∆∆ , and z∆  are of the order of millimeter, 
t∆  is therefore of the order of microsecond to 
satisfy the stability condition. Generally, the 
statistical stationary fluid dynamical results can 
be obtained after 10,000 time steps. To 
calculate the time averaged fluid dynamical 
variables, a time interval of 5,000 time steps is 
needed. 
 
?. Results and Discussions 
Figure 3 shows the instantaneous isodensity 
plot of a 3D free shear layer at velocity ratio 
0.5 and density ratio 1.1. Examining this figure 
carefully, the adjacent structures are connected 
by braids which are regions of low vorticity 
and highly strained. The center of the shear 
layer moves towards the low-speed side. There 
are more fluid particles entrained from the 
high-speed side than that from the low-speed 
side in the mixing region. Entrainment 
asymmetry is an important feature of the spatial 
shear layer and this result is consistent with the 
experimental evidence [13, 14] and other 
numerical simulations [15]. Figure 4 shows a 
sequence of instantaneous flow visualization of 
the density field for the natural shear layer. 
These figures clearly show the pairing 
phenomenon between two vortices. This vortex 
amalgamation process occurs randomly in 
space and time and it is responsible for the 
linear growth rate of shear layer. In the fully 
developed region, statistics of the fluid 
dynamical variables such as streamwise 
velocity, rms u-fluctuations, v-fluctuations, and 
w-fluctuations as well as the Reynolds stress 
distribution show that the flow is self-similar 
which are not shown due to limited space. 
Figure 5 and Figure 6 are plots of isodensity 
field for the shear layer under fundamental 
frequency and first subharmonic frequency 
perturation respectively. Forcing with 
fundamental or subharmonic frequency 
produces controlled coherent structures where 
the growth rate of the forced shear layer is zero. 
In the non-growing region of the shear layer, 
amalgamation of neighboring vortices are 
inhibited and the mixing layer consists of an 
array of large eddies in the lateral direction 
with no interactions.. The trends of all fluid 
dymical results obtained are consistent with 
experimental and numerical results of others  
[16, 17] lend full confidence that the code has 
been validated satisfactorily. The density field 
then can be used for shear layer optical 
property studies. 
The phase distortation of a coherent light beam 
plays a very important role in determing the 
far-field properties of the beam. Coherent 
structures of the shear layer generate phase
