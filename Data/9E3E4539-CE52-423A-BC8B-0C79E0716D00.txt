2. English Abstract 
In the first year, nine cellulolytic efficient bacterial strains were isolated from soil samples in 
southern Taiwan and by using 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis discovered that 
eight strains are belongs to Cellulomonas genus among which five strains (ANA-NS1, ANA-NS2, 
ANA-NS6, ANA-FP2 and ANA-FP4) have 99.7 sequence similarity with Cellulomonas uda DSM 
20107T and other strains are identified as (RP-3) Cellulomonas flavigena DSM 20109T, (I-1) 
Cellulomonas gelida DSM 2011T, (ANA-WS2), Cellulomonas fermentans DSM 20109T and (L-133) 
Cellulosimicrobium cellulans DSM 43879T with 97-99 % sequence similarity. These strains were 
confirmed to produce reducing sugar from hydrolyzing cellulosic substrates. Furthermore, 
production of cellulases (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, cellobiase) and xylanase by isolated strains 
pH, 200 rpm of agitation rate, and 10 U/ml of FPase activity. The best temperature for pretreatment 
of cellulosic feedstock on NaOH pretreated was high temperature (120oC) to get high reducing 
sugar yield for enzymatic hydrolysis. In this study, the dark fermentative strain (Clostridium 
butyricum CGS5) and photo fermentative strain (Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5) were used 
to investigate sequential dark-photo fermentation while carbon source was sucrose on continuously 
stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The maximum H2 yield was up to 5.81 mol H2/mol hexose. The 
Chlorella vulgaris C-C on microalgae photoautotrophic process was grown autotrophically using 
carbon dioxide produced from dark and photo fermentation processes as the sole carbon source. The 
CO2 was nearly completely consumed by Ch. vulgaris C-C, as no residual CO2 was detected in the 
gas effluent of the microalgal culture. Finally, the cellulose pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis 
processes were combined with sequential dark-photo fermentation and microalgae processes to 
produce bioH2 from cellulosic feedstock (i.e., rice straw). The results show that the sequential 
dark-photo fermentation and microalgae system was successfully integrated with cellulose 
pretreatment and hydrolysis for cellulosic bioH2 production with a high H2 yield of up to 6.94 mol 
H2/mol hexose on CSTR mode.

3. Introduction 
Nowadays global energy supply depends heavily on fossil fuel for current economy and 
lifestyle. Consequently fossil fuel demands growing at exponential rate and major consumption are 
in the transport sector. Depending on the production and consumption rates, the presently known 
reserves of fossil fuels are estimated to last anywhere from 41 to 700 years (1-2). The finitude of 
fossil fuels, concerns for energy security and the unfettered use of fossil fuels shows negative 
impacts on environment because of emission of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and CO) resulting in 
global warming and pollution (3-4). We have already witness the changes - glaciers are melting, 
plants and animals are being forced from their habitats, and the number of severe storms and 
droughts is increasing. If the warming continues, we would expect catastrophic consequences. For 
these reasons, in this century large efforts are being conducted worldwide to use noncarbonaceous 
fuels, produced from renewable feedstock which can reduce greenhouse gas emission, during fuel 
production and fuel combustion. 
Hydrogen has emerged as one of the most promising new energy carriers, because it is clean, 
the atmosphere, rather than properly trapped or removed to mitigate CO2 emissions. It would better 
if the CO2 produced from the fermentation processes could be used for the autotrophic growth of 
microalgae, converting it to microalgal biomass, which may contain high carbohydrate, protein or 
lipid contents for the production of biofuels and/or other value-added products (20-21).  
In first year study, we isolate nine microbial strains having higher efficiency in cellulose 
hydrolysis and determined the effects of different substrates (xylan, rice husk and rice straw) on the 
production of cellulase enzymes (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, cellobiase and xylanase) at their 
different locations (extracellular, intracellular and cell bound) by isolated cellulolytic 
microorganisms. HPLC analysis proves the degradation of these cellulosic substrates into soluble 
sugars. Finally, the resulting hydrolysate was used as the carbon substrate for dark fermentative H2 
production using various isolated Clostridium strains known to produce H2 efficiently from sugar 
substrates. The knowledge obtained from this study could be used to assess the feasibility of using 
this two-stage (i.e., hydrolysis-fermentation) strategy for fermentative H2 production, taking 
cellulosic materials as the feedstock. 
In second year study, we have determined the ability of Cellulomonas biazotea NCIM-2550 in 
the hydrolysis of different cellulosic substrates (CMC, bagasse, xylan) and also identify the 
production of cellulase enzymes at different cellular locations (extracellular, intracellular and cell 
bound) under shaking condition. Various physicochemical parameters were optimized to achieve 
maximum enzyme and reducing sugar production. Finally, the cellulose hydrolysate was used as the 
carbon substrate for dark fermentative H2 production using various isolated Clostridium strains 
known to produce H2 efficiently from sugar substrates. This work is expected to provide useful 
information for assessing the feasibility of using two-stage process involving sequential enzymatic 
cellulose hydrolysis and hydrogen fermentation for cellulosic biohydrogen production. 
In third year study, we first isolated efficient cellulase-producing thermophilic anaerobic 
bacterium able to grow efficiently on medium containing filter paper as the sole carbon source. This 
cellulolytic bacterium was used to produce cellulases and xylanase for the enzymatic hydrolysis of 
lignocellulosic feedstock (i.e., rice straw). The pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis was 
integrated with sequential dark-photo fermentation and photoautotrphic microalgae to develop a 
high-yield and CO2-free bioH2 production process. The favorable conditions were identified to 
achieve efficient cellulase production, cellulose pretreatment and hydrolysis, and integration of 
dark-photo fermentation and CO2-fixation via photoautotrphic microalgae growth. This study aimed 
to demonstrate the feasibility of combining novel microbiological and engineering technologies to 
enhance the efficiency and commercial viability of bioH2 production; thereby the goal toward 
hydrogen economy could be achieved in an accelerating way. 
The Clostridium sp. TCW1 (EU916270) was grown with anaerobic medium using filter-paper as 
substrate. The medium consisting of (g/l): filter-paper, 5.0; NH4HCO3, 6.72; NaHCO3, 5.24;

1.25×10−4.The thermophilic bacterium was cultivated at 60oC and 200 rpm anaerobically for 3 day 
to prepare the cellulosic enzyme. The initial pH value of medium was adjusted to 7.5. Argon gas 
was used to enhance anaerobic condition. 
Dark Hydrogen-producing bacterial strains were isolated from effluent sludge of a continuous 
dark fermentation bioreactor capable of producing H2 from synthetic wastewater containing sucrose 
(20 g COD/l) or xylose (20-40 g COD/l) as the sole carbon source (23-24). The pure H2-producing 
strains obtained in our recent study (namely, Clostridium butyricum CGS2, C. butyricum CGS5, C. 
pasteurianum CH1, C. pasteurianum CH4, C. pasteurianum CH5, C. pasteurianum CH7 and 
Klebsiella sp. HE1) were used for hydrogen production (23-24). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of 
the bacterial isolates used in this study have been deposited in the NCBI nucleotide sequence 
databases under the following accession number: AY540106 (strain CGS2), AY540109 (strain 
CGS5), EF140980 (strain CH1), EF140981 (strain CH4), EF140982 (strain CH5), EF140983 (strain 
CH7), and AY540111 (strain HE1). Those pure strains were precultured using sucrose (17.8 g/l) as 
the sole carbon source. Batch fermentation was carried out by static incubation in sealed serum 
bottles. The medium for dark H2 fermentation was (g/l): hydrolyzed cellulose, adjustable initial 
reducing sugar concentration; NH4HCO3, 6.72; NaHCO3, 5.24; K2HPO4, 0.125; MgCl2.6H2O, 0.1; 
MnSO4.6H2O, 0.015; FeSO4.7H2O, 0.025; CuSO4.5H2O, 0.005; CoCl2.5H2O, 1.25 × 10-4. The 
culture temperature and pH was 37oC and 7.5, respectively. During the course of fermentation, cell 
concentration, pH, residual reducing sugar, and production of biogas and soluble metabolites were 
monitored with respect to culture time. 
Rhodopseudomonas palustris WP3-5 isolated from a swine wastewater treatment plant located 
in central Taiwan (25-26) was used for phototrophic H2 production. The medium used to cultivate R. 
palustris WP3-5 consisted of (g/l): K2HPO4, 0.5; KH2PO4, 0.5; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.2; NaCl, 0.4; 
CaCl2.2H2O, 0.05; yeast extract, 0.2; iron citrate solution (1.0 g/l), 5 ml/l; trace element solution, 
1ml. The trace element solution contained (in mg/l) ZnCl2, 70; MnCl2.4H2O, 100; H3BO3, 60; 
CoCl2.6H2O, 200; CuCl2.2H2O, 20; NiCl2.6H2O, 20; NaMoO4.2H2O, 40; HCl (25%), 1 ml/l. 
The microalga strain used in this work was Chlorella vulgaris C-C isolated from freshwater 
located in southern Taiwan. The medium used to cultivate Ch. vulgaris C-C consisted of (g/l): 
KNO3, 0.3; KH2PO4,1.25; MgSO4.7H2O, 1.0; CaCl2, 0.0835; FeSO4.7H2O, 0.0498; Na2EDTA, 0.5; 
enzymes data presented are the average of three replicates. 
4.4 Protein determination 
The protein concentration was measured by the dye binding method of Bradford (32) using the 
Bio-Rad dye reagent concentrate (500-0006, Bio-Rad) in microtiter plates. A standard curve was 
generated using solutions containing 0.1 g/L bovine serum albumin (BSA). Absorbances were 
measured in triplicate at 595 nm after 20 min of incubation at room temperature. 
4.5 Analytical methods 
The cellulose hydrolysates and soluble metabolites in fermented broth were analyzed using 
HPLC (LC-10AT, RID-10A, Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a RI detector for the presence of 
sugars, acid content and ethanol. The column used in HPLC analysis was Transgenomic, USA 
(ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3) column using 0.008 N H2SO4 as eluent with a flow rate of 0.4 
mL/min. The column oven temperature was kept at 55oC. The gas products (mainly H2 and CO2) 
was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) using a thermal conductivity detector. The detailed 
procedures for GC analyses were described in our recent work (33). Standard methods (34) were 
used to determine biomass concentration. 
5. Materials and methods 
5.1 Isolation of cellulose and xylan hydrolytic bacterial strains (first year) 
The seven strains (ANA-NS1, ANA-NS2, ANA-NS6, DI-1, RP-3, ANA-WS2, and L-133) 
capable of producing cellulase and xylan hydrolytic activities were obtained from soil of rice field. 
All strains grew well under aerobic or facultatively anaerobic conditions at 35oC on CMC-amended 
BHM medium. Colonies on CMC agar plates are circular, smooth, creamy yellow circles within 3 
days at 35oC. Microscopic examination showed that the nine strains were in straight rods with Gram 
positive reaction. The nearly full-length sequences of 16S rRNA gene were also determined for the 
seven isolates. Based on the sequence identity of 16S rRNA gene, strains ANA-NS1, ANA-NS2, 
and ANA-NS6 resemble to each other with a 99.9% identity. The highest similarity values of strains 
ANA-NS1, ANA-NS2 and ANA-NS6 were obtained towards the type strain of Cellulomonas uda 
DSM 20107T (99.7% identity). Moreover, stains DI-1, RP-3 and ANA-WS2 were also found to 
belong to genus Cellulomonas, but represent different sublines within the genus Cellulomonas (Fig. 
1). The highest similarity values of strains DI-1, RP-3 and ANA-WS2 were obtained towards type 
strains of Cellulomonas gelida DSM 20111T (99.5% identity), Cellulomonas flavigena DSM 
20109T (98.5% identity) and Cellulomonas fermentans DSM 3133T (97.8% identity), respectively. 
A comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain L-133 with those of members of genera 
Astoundingly, in the presence of rice husk some strains (I-1 & ANA-WS2) gives maximum 
endoglucanase activity (1194.66 & 751.21 U/mg protein) extracellularly (Fig 4a) compared to xylan 
and rice straw. Some strains in the presence of rice straw (RP3, I-1, L-133) and xylan (ANA-NS-1, 
FP-2, ANA-WS2) L-133 can produce endoglucanase at extracellular and cell bound locations. 
Amazingly, some strains (ANA-NS-1/ rice straw; ANA-NS-2, RP3/xylan; ANA-WS2/rice husk) 
can produce endoglucanase at extracellular, intracellular and cell bound locations.  
Production of exoglucanase was significant extracellularly in the presence of xylan and rice 
straw by all isolated strains (except I-1, L-133/xylan & I-1/rice straw). When xylan was used as a 
cellulosic substrate the significant induction of exoglucanase activity (68.95 and 53.69 U/mg 
protein) was observed by strain (ANA-NS2 and ANA-NS6); whereas other strains give moderate 
induction at extracellular location (Fig 2a). It was noticed that ANA-WS2 strain can produce 
exoglucanase at extracellular, intracellular and cell bound locations. Negligible performance was 
observed by some strains at intracellular and cell bound locations (Fig 2b & c). When rice straw 
was used the exoglucanase activity was significant extracellularly by all strains (except I-1) (Fig 3a). 
Amazingly, RP-3 strain imparts maximum exoglucanase activity (31.94 U/mg protein) at 
intracellular location and also shows better performance at extracellular as well as cell bound 
locations (Fig 3a, b & c); whereas negligible performance was observed by some strains at 
intracellular and cell bound location (Fig 3b & c). In the presence of rice husk maximum 
exoglucanase activity (56.15 U/mg protein) was observed by ANA-WS2 strain intracellularly; 
which also secretes exoglucanase at extracellular and cell bound locations (Fig 4a). Some strains 
(I-1 and FP-4) produce exoglucanase significantly at intracellular and cell bound locations; whereas 
FP-2 can produce exoglucanase intracellularly (Fig 4b & c).  
Very poor performance of cellobiase was observed in the presence of xylan and rice straw as 
substrates. In the presence of all these cellulosic substrates there is no production of cellobiase at 
intracellular as well as cell bound locations exclusively, ANA-WS2, and L-133 in the presence 
xylan as cellulosic substrate. Significant production of cellobiase extracellularly observed in the 
presence of rice husk by all strains (Fig 4a) (except ANA-NS1 & RP3) and also in the presence of 
xylan and rice straw some strains can produce cellobiase extracellularly (Fig 2a & 3a). In the 
presence of rice husk the maximum activity (69.32 and 77.81 U/mg protein) was observed 
extracellularly by (ANA-NS-6 and L-133). Surprisingly, in the presence of xylan fantabulous 
cellobiase production performance (115.91 & 228.16 U/mg protein) was observed by ANA-WS2 
and L-133 at cell bound location among which L-133 can secrete cellobiase at extracellular as well 
as intracellular location.  
In the presence of xylan and rice straw production of xylanase was significant extracellularly. 
products. 
5.4 Dark fermentative H2 production from the cellulosic hydrolysate (first year) 
The efficiency of fermentative conversion of cellulosic hydrolysate into clean H2 energy was 
examined with seven H2-producing pure strains isolated from effluent sludge of high-rate 
H2-producing bioreactors developed in our recent work (42-43). The isolates were identified as 
Clostridium butyricum CGS2, Cl. butyricum CGS5, Cl. pasteurianum CH1, Cl. pasteurianum CH4, 
Cl. pasteurianum CH5, Cl. pasteurianum CH7 and Klebsiella sp. HE1. Figure 5 and 6 shows bioH2 
production from the with different initial reducing sugar concentration (0.99 and 0.67 g reducing 
sugar/l). Only C. butyricum species and Klebsiella sp. could use the hydrolyzed cellulose to produce 
H2, whereas C. pasteurianum species failed to produce H2 from the hydrolysate. With an initial 
reducing sugar concentration of 0.99 g/l, the best H2 production and yield (obtained by Cl. 
butyricum CGS5) was approximately 9.05 ml/l and 3.08 mmol H2/g reducing sugar (or 2.77 mmol 
H2/g cellulose), respectively. Analogously, while initial reducing sugar concentration was 0.67 g/l, 
the best H2 production and yield (obtained by Cl. butyricum CGS2) was approximately 13.05 ml/l 
and 4.45 mmol H2/g reducing sugar (or 4.01 mmol H2/g cellulose), respectively. (CGS5 18.71 ml/l 
4.07 mmol H2/g reducing sugar) (44) demonstrated the H2 production in batch fermentation under 
thermophilic conditions by employing pure strain of Thermotoga maritima (39.8 ml/l) and T. 
neapolitana (49.7 ml/l) using cellulose as a carbon source. The production yield attained from their 
study was yield of 0.96 and 1.07 mmol H2/g cellulose, respectively (44). Thus, despite operating at 
a mesophilic temperature, the H2 production performance of this work was higher than that obtained 
under thermophilic conditions (44). 
5.5 Cellulolytic enzymes production from cellulosic substrates by cellulolytic bacteria (second 
year) 
Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic feedstock has several advantages over chemical processes 
because of its potentially high saccharification efficiency, less energy consumption and avoidance 
of pollution (4, 45). Cellulomonas strains are found to be effective due to secretion of different 
cellulolytic enzymes that renders a promising tool due to high productivity and stability. These 
features make them industrially important microorganisms alternative to fungal system for the 
development of textile, food and paper-pulp processing (46).  
Production of cellulase (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, cellobiase, xylanase, etc.) in the 
presence of different cellulosic substrates (CMC, xylan, SCB) were studied by using four different 
cellulolytic microorganisms Cellulomonas biazotea NCIM-2550, Cellulomonas gelida NCIM-2482, 
Cellulomonas flavigena NCIM-2481 and Cellulomonas fimi NCIM-5015. All four strains were 
which is inducible in nature (49).  
In the presence of CMC; exoglucanase, endoglucanase, xylanase and total amylase production 
was observed at all cellular location. In which significant production of endoglucanase (27 U/mL), 
exoglucanase (16.4 U/mL), cellobiase (65 U/mL) and xylanase (245 U/mL) observed extracellularly, 
whereas moderate production of endoglucanase (8.0 and 3.0 U/mL), exoglucanase (3.82 and 1.75 
U/mL) and xylanase (159 and 140 U/mL) activity was observed at intracellular and cell bound 
locations, respectively (Fig. 8a). Cellobiase activity was also observed at intracellular (24 U/mL) 
location but there is no activity at cell bound location. In contrast, lignin peroxidase (0.15 & 0.12 
U/mL) and Mn peroxidase (0.35 & 0.28 U/mL) activities were observed at extracellular and 
intracellular location. All enzyme activities (except amylase) were significantly observed 
extracellularly however higher amylase (132.0 U/mL) activity was observed at intracellular location 
(Fig. 8a).  
In the presence of xylan significant induction in xylanase (365 U/mL), total amylase (169 
U/mL), endoglucanase (48 U/mL) and exoglucanase (27 U/mL) was observed extracellularly (Fig. 
8b). Interestingly, moderate production of xylanase (206 and 139 U/mL) and total amylase (196 and 
71 U/mL) was observed at intracellular and cell bound location, respectively. In contrast, 
exoglucanase (9.3 U/mL), endoglucanase (21 U/mL) and cellobiase (54 U/mL) activity was 
observed at intracellular location and there is no activity at cell bound location (Fig. 8b). Slight 
induction in lignin peroxidase (0.25 & 0.18 U/mL) and Mn peroxidase (0.55 & 0.23 U/mL) 
activities were observed at extracellular and intracellular compartments only. Thus in the presence 
of xylan the higher induction in xylanase activity was observed at extracellular location (365 U/mL), 
whereas surprisingly total amylase activity was higher at intracellular location (196 U/mL) (Fig. 
8b).  
From the economic point of view, there is a need to increase cellulase enzyme volumetric 
productivity by using cheaper substrates (lignocellulosic biomass), with higher stability and 
specificity (substrates) for specific processes (48). Therefore, in this study, a natural agricultural 
residue (i.e., sugarcane bagasse) was used as a carbon source for cellulase production by C. 
biazotea NCIM-2550. It was observed that during the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass, 
disaccharides and oligosaccharides were liberated and found to be strong inducers of cellulases (50). 
Using sugarcane bagasse as a carbon source, significant induction in the endoglucanase (56 U/mL), 
xylanase (330 U/mL), cellobiase (79 U/mL) and exoglucanase (27 U/mL) was observed 
extracellularly (Fig. 8c). In contrast, higher total amylase (199 U/mL) activity was observed 
intracellularly compared to extracellular (100 U/mL) and cell bound (102 U/mL) locations, as 
similar result was observed in Cellulomonas flavigena (49). Likewise, xylanase production was 
EU2D-21 (225.0 U/mL) (50), Trichoderma reesei (9.95 U/mL), and Trichoderma harzianum (12.56 
U/mL) (54) and mutant Fusarium oxysporum NTG-19, (35.6 U/mL) (62). 
5.7 Effect of different physical conditions on the cellulolytic enzyme production (second year) 
Microbial cellulase production has been influenced by a number of factors including the type 
of strain used, reaction conditions (temperature, pH, etc.) and inducer/substrate types. The 
relationship between these variables has a marked effect on the production of the cellulase enzymes 
(4, 45). Moreover, cellulases are relatively costly enzymes, and a significant reduction in the cost 
will be important for their commercial use in the preparation of cellulosic feedstock. Im this work, 
the effect of various physical conditions (agitation rate, temperature, and pH) on the production of 
cellulolytic enzymes by using C. biazotea NCIM-2550 was studied in detail. The effect of static and 
shaking (200 rpm) conditions on the reducing sugar production and cellular growth by C. biazotea 
NCIM-2550 in the presence of CMC as a carbon source was investigated. Reducing sugar 
production performance by hydrolyzing CMC using C. biazotea NCIM-2550 was higher under 
shaking (42 mg/L) condition when compared with static condition (21 mg/L) (Fig. 9). The growth 
of C. biazotea NCIM-2550 was better at shaking condition as compared to static condition (Fig. 9). 
Similar results were observed in case of Cellulomonas biazotea and Cellulomonas sp. where 
shaking condition found to be better for their growth as well as cellulolytic enzyme production (48, 
51). Thus, aerobic shaking condition was necessary for the better reducing sugar production due to 
more cellular interaction with the substrate for better cellular growth. In light of this, shaking 
conditions were adopted to investigate the cellulolytic enzyme production by C. biazotea 
NCIM-2550 in the following experiments. Identification of optimum conditions, like agitation rate, 
temperature and pH for better cellulolytic enzymes production is important in increasing the 
efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis. The cellulolytic enzyme production (exoglucanase, 
endoglucanase, cellobiase, xylanase and amylase) in the presence of all cellulosic substrates (CMC, 
xylan and SCB) by C. biazotea NCIM-2550 at different agitation rate (50 to 250 rpm) were studied. 
All enzyme activity sequentially increased from 50 to 200 rpm, while marginal reduction in all 
enzyme activity was observed at 250 rpm (Table 4). The foregoing results indicate the optimum 
agitation rate (200 rpm) for better cellulolytic enzyme production in the presence of all cellulosic 
substrates by C. biazotea NCIM-2550. The effect of temperature (30 to 55oC) and pH (3 to 8) on 
the production of cellulolytic enzymes in the presence of all cellulosic substrates by C. biazotea 
NCIM-2550 was determined. The optimum temperature for exoglucanase, endoglucanase, 
cellobiase and total amylase activity was observed at 40oC whereas maximum xylanase activity was 
recorded at 50oC for all cellulosic substrates. At 40 to 45oC, significant productions of cellobiase 
preliminary tests show that Mn2+ ions stimulated all enzyme activities from C. biazotea NCIM-2550, 
a detailed study was carried out by using various Mn2+ ion concentrations (1mM to 10 mM). In the 
presence of bagasse and xylan the maximal production of endoglucanase and exoglucanase was 
obtained at 2 mM and 3 mM concentration, respectively, whereas xylanase and cellobiase was 
significantly induced at a Mn2+ ion concentration of (5 and 2 mM) and (2 and 3 mM), respectively 
(data not shown). However, at higher Mn2+ concentration (above 5 mM) inhibition in all enzyme 
activities was observed. Likewise, the endoglucanase activity of C. biazotea and Aspergillus niger 
and activity of xylanase of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens got induced at an appropriate Mn2+ 
concentration, but were inhibited when the metal ion concentration was too high (64-65). 
5.9 Effect of cellulosic substrate and its concentration on reducing sugar production (second 
year) 
The cellulase enzyme system exhibited from C. biazotea NCIM-2550 may have different 
hydrolytic activity on different cellulosic materials comprising different composition of cellulose, 
hemicellulose and lignin (66). Hence, we determined the hydrolytic efficiency of C. biazotea grown 
on Dubos medium by taking purified (CMC-Sigma, avicel, xylan) and several agricultural residues 
(rice husk, rice straw, sugarcane bagasse) as the carbon source (all at an initial concentration of 5 
g/L) to explore the effect of carbon sources on cellulose hydrolysis. All carbon sources (except 
avicel) could be hydrolyzed significantly by C. biazotea NCIM-2550, producing reducing sugars. 
However, hydrolysis of the complex agricultural residue (SCB) and purified xylan exhibited high 
reducing sugar production and production rate than that with crystalline cellulose or more complex 
structure (i.e., avicel, rice husk, rice straw and CMC) (Fig. 10). Among the cellulosic materials 
examined, hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse and xylan gave the best hydrolysis efficiency with a 
maximum reducing sugar production quantity (1555 and 345 mg/L) and reducing sugar production 
rate (9.25 and 2.05 mg/h/L), respectively (Fig. 10). Using the most effective cellulosic substrates 
(i.e., SCB and xylan), the effect of increasing cellulose concentration on cellulose hydrolysis was 
further investigated. As indicated in Fig. 11, the reducing sugar production rate and the amount of 
reducing sugar produced increased when the carbon source concentration was increased from 1 to 
10 g/L. The maximum reducing sugar production (1990 and 443 mg/L) and the maximum reducing 
sugar production rate (11.84 and 2.63 mg/h/L) were achieved when SCB and xylan concentration 
was 10 g/L (Fig. 11a and 11b). The results show that there was essentially no signal of substrate 
inhibition on cellulose hydrolysis of SCB and xylan when the concentration range was within 1-10 
g/L. Similar results were observed in the hydrolysis of CMC for a CMC concentration range of 5-50 
g/L by cellulolytic mixed culture, showing a maximum total reducing sugar production quantity and 
and ethanol as soluble metabolites due to microbial metabolism. Therefore hydrolysates resulting 
from different cellulosic substrates comprised different composition of saccharide and other 
metabolic products, which could significantly affect the performance of follow-up energy (e.g., 
biohydrogen) production. 
5.12 Dark fermentative H2 production from the cellulosic hydrolysate (second year) 
As a sustainable energy supply with minimal or zero use of hydrocarbons, hydrogen is a 
promising alternative to fossil fuel with many social, economic and environmental benefits to its 
credit (67). The efficiency of fermentative conversion of cellulosic hydrolysate into clean H2 energy 
was examined with seven H2-producing pure strains isolated from effluent sludge of high-rate 
H2-producing bioreactors developed in our recent work (42-43). With sugarcane bagasse and xylan 
hydrolysate at an initial reducing sugar concentration of 1.545 g/L and 0.345 g/L, respectively, 
Clostridium butyricum CGS5 gave the best H2 production quantity of approximately 72.6 and 87.0 
mL/L, respectively, and the highest H2 yield of 2.13 and 5.03 mmol H2/g reducing sugar (1.91 and 
4.01 mmol H2/g cellulose), respectively (Table 7). The H2 content in the biogas was 50-65%. The 
results demonstrate the feasibility of using the two-stage system converting natural cellulosic 
feedstock to hydrogen under mild operating condition. The soluble metabolites formed along with 
cellulosic H2 production from bagasse consisted mainly of ethanol, followed by formate, acetate, 
butyrate and lactate. Using xylan as substrate, soluble metabolites mainly contained butyrate and 
formate followed by acetate, lactate and ethanol (Table 7). The primary soluble metabolite 
produced by Cl. butyricum CGS5 from using bagasse was ethanol, which is quite different from the 
composition obtained from using sucrose or xylose for H2 production, in which the soluble 
metabolites contained mainly butyrate and acetate (68). In this work, predominant ethanol 
production occurred due probably to the complex composition of sugarcane bagasse, making 
unfavorable for dark hydrogen production (5). Similarly, for sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate even 
though the presence of higher amount of reducing sugar (1.545 g/L), less amount of hydrogen 
production (2.13 mmol H2/g reducing sugar) was observed when compared to xylan hydrolysate 
(5.03 mmol H2/g reducing sugar) (Table 7). This suggests that the bioH2 production efficiency was 
influenced not only by the initial sugar concentration, but also by the content of the other 
metabolites present in the cellulosic hydrolysates. Also, it would require further optimization of 
bioreactor design and operation conditions to favor the H2 production metabolism and also to 
reduce the cost of bioH2 production via a more efficient sequencing hydrolysis-fermentation 
approach. 
5.13 Identification of enzyme production location (third year) 
(120oC) temperature. Then, enzyme from Cl. sp. TCW1 was used to investigate hydrolysis 
efficiency of rice straw which had none-pretreated, pretreated at room temperature, pretreated at 
low temperature and pretreated at high temperature. The enzymatic hydrolysis conditions were 
controlled at temperature: 55oC, pH: 7, agitation rate: 200 rpm, and FPase activity: 0.5 U/ml. The 
rice straw by alkaline pretreatment at high (120oC) temperature was higher reducing sugar yield 
than other pretreatment methods. The reducing sugar yield and reducing sugar production rate was 
75.42±2.60% and 0.357 g/L/h, respectively (Fig. 17). Mono-sugar and di-sugar content from rice 
straw by alkaline pretreatment at high (120oC) temperature was higher than other pretreatment 
methods (Table 10). Reducing sugar, mono-sugar (glucose, xylose and arabinose) and di-sugar 
(cellobiose and xylobiose) was increased when enzymatic reaction time was increased on rice straw 
with alkaline pretreatment at high (120oC) temperature (Fig. 18). Therefore, the suitable 
pretreatment by alkaline (NaOH) at high temperature was used to investigate optimal enzymatic 
hydrolysis for rice straw. 
5.16 Effect of temperature, pH, agitation rate and FPase activity on enzymatic hydrolysis of 
rice straw (third year) 
The optimal condition for enzymatic hydrolysis was investigated to enhance enzymatic 
hydrolysis efficiency. The temperature, pH, agitation rate and FPase activity were an important 
factor for enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, temperature (30-70oC), pH (4-10), agitation rate (0-200 
rpm) and FPase activity (0.625-10 U/ml) was investigated From those results (Fig. 19, Fig. 20, Fig. 
21 and Fig. 22), the optimal cellulosic (rice straw) hydrolysis conditions were temperature 
controlled at 60oC, pH at 6, agitation rate at 200 rpm and FPase activity at 10 U/ml. The cellulosic 
hydrolysis yield was enhanced on this condition when carbon source was rice straw.  
5.17 Continuous bioH2 production with sequential dark-photo fermentation (third year) 
The feasibility and stability of the sequential dark-photo fermentation (SDPF) processes were 
assessed on continuous mode using sucrose as the carbon source. The continuous dark fermentative 
H2 production was started up at 12 h HRT until it reached a steady state in terms of production rate 
and yield. For dark fermentation resulted in a higher H2 production rate and yield of 667.4 ml/h/L 
and 6.56 mol H2/mol sucrose, respectively (Table 11 and Fig. 23). The cell concentration also 
reached a nearly steady-state value of 1.62±0.22 g/L for the 80-day operation (Fig. 23). The H2 
content in biogas was nearly constant at 57.5±1.1% (Fig. 23). Moreover, a relatively low 
ammonium content of 46.94±3.61 mg/L was observed in the effluent of the dark fermentation 
system (Table 11 and Fig. 23), which is higher than the inhibitory level of ammonium (17 mg/L) to 
5.18 Phototrophic fixation of CO2 produced from SDPF processes with an isolated microalga 
Chlorella vulgaris C-C strain (third year) 
Since a large amount of carbon dioxide was produced from the dark and photo fermentation 
processes, removal of CO2 to reduce CO2 emissions in this SDPF process is desirable. Although the 
CO2 produced from dark-photo fermentation can be captured by using chemical or physical 
approaches, it would be better and more interesting to utilize this gaseous carbon dioxide via 
autotrophic growth of microalgae. Microalgal biofixation of CO2 is efficient, environmentally 
friendly, and the resulting microalgal biomass may contain high carbohydrate or lipid content, and 
could thus be used as an additional source for biofuel production (78-80). Therefore, the gas 
effluents (containing CO2 and H2) of dark and photo fermentation were directly introduced into a 
pure culture of an indigenous microalgal strain (Chlorella vulgaris C-C) cultivated in a 1.0 liter 
batch photo-bioreactor illuminated with TL5 filament lamps at a light intensity of ca. 60.0 
μmol/m2-s.  
The microalga was grown autotrophically using carbon dioxide produced from dark and photo 
fermentation processes as the sole carbon source. As shown in Fig. 25a and 25b, the average CO2 
content in the gas effluent of the dark and photo fermentation processes was 42.5% and 7.87%, 
respectively, and the gaseous flow rate entering the microalgal culture was around 437 ml/h/L and 
0.426 ml/h/L, respectively. Under this condition, the CO2 was nearly completely consumed by Ch. 
vulgaris C-C, as no residual CO2 was detected in the gas effluent of the microalgal culture (Fig. 
25c). In addition, a total microalgal biomass production of 1999 mg/L was obtained over the 30-day 
operation (Fig. 25c). These results demonstrate the feasibility of SDPF processses and autotrophic 
microalgal growth processes to achieve high-yield bioH2 production without any CO2 emissions. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the use of a three-stage process 
(dark fermentation, photo fermentation and microalgae culture) to achieve continuous and CO2-free 
fermentative bioH2 production. 
The microalgal biomass produced from the three-stage process could also have the potential to 
serve as the raw material for the production of biofuels or other value-added products. Therefore, to 
better understand the commercial potential of the microalgal biomass thus produced, the main 
chemical composition of Chlorella vulgaris C-C was analyzed. As depicted in Fig. 26, the major 
component in the microalgal biomass was protein, accounting for nearly 48±3% of the total 
biomass (based on dry weight), followed by carbohydrate (23±2%) and total lipid (12±1%). The 
high protein content in Ch. vulgaris C-C indicates a high potential for using the microalgal biomass 
for nutritional purposes (81). The carbohydrate and lipid content in Ch. vulgaris C-C could also be 
applied to produce biofuels or health food. The active components of Ch. vulgaris C-C biomass will 
and photo fermentation reached a high value of 34.17 mmol H2/g COD (with 10f-DSM).  
The microalga was grown autotrophically using carbon dioxide produced from dark and photo 
fermentation processes as the sole carbon source. As shown in Fig. 29a and 29b, the average CO2 
content in the gas effluent of the dark and photo fermentation processes was 25.8% and 8.29%, 
respectively, and the gaseous flow rate entering the microalgal culture was around 102 ml/h/L and 
0.572 ml/h/L, respectively. Under this condition, the CO2 was nearly completely consumed by Ch. 
vulgaris C-C, as no residual CO2 was detected in the gas effluent of the microalgal culture (Fig. 
29c). In addition, a total microalgal biomass production of 185 mg/L was obtained over the 9-day 
operation (Fig. 29c). These results demonstrate the feasibility of SDPF processses and autotrophic 
microalgal growth processes from rice straw hydrolysate to achieve high-yield bioH2 production 
without any CO2 emissions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the 
use of a three-stage process (dark fermentation, photo fermentation and microalgae culture) to 
achieve continuous and CO2-free fermentative bioH2 production.  
6. Conclusions 
This study was showed that all cellulosic hydrolysis bacterial strains could produce cellulase.  
The cellulase production from anaerobic thermophilic Clostridium sp. TCW1 was higher than from 
other bacteria strains (Cellulomonas uda, Cellulomonas flavigena, Cellulomonas gelida, 
Cellulomonas fermentans, Cellulosimicrobium cellulan, Cellulomonas biazotea NCIM-2550, 
Cellulomonas gelida NCIM-2482, Cellulomonas flavigena NCIM-2481 and Cellulomonas fimi 
NCIM-5015). Anaerobic thermophilic Clostridium sp TCW1 was isolated from cow dung. The 
Clostridium sp. TCW1 could produce cellulolytic enzymes (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, xylanase, 
and b-glucosidase) from a variety of carbon sources. The location of cellulolytic enzymes produced 
was mainly in extracellular compartment. Using an acetone/enzyme ratio of 2 could effectively 
concentrate and collect the enzymes with a high FPase activity. The collected cellulolytic enzymes 
were used to hydrolyze rice straw pretreated with alkaline (NaOH) at high temperature. The optimal 
enzymatic hydrolysis conditions were temperature, 60oC; initial pH, 6; agitation rate, 200 rpm; 
FPase activity, 10 U/ml. This work also demonstrated the feasibility of SDPF system and 
microalgae photosynthesis processes to not only increase the overall hydrogen yield, but also 
reduce CO2 emissions. Moreover, the pretreatment method and enzymatic hydrolysis were 
combined with SDPF and microalgae photosynthesis processes to enable H2 production from rice 
staw. The total hydrogen yield and overall H2 production rate with SDPF from sucrose were 11.61 
mol H2/mol sucrose (or 5.85 mol H2/mol hexose) and 673.93 ml/h/L, respectively. The total 
hydrogen yield and overall H2 production rate with SDPF from rice straw hydrolysate were 34.17
