計畫英文摘要。（五百字以內） 
Keywords：Silty sand, Soil liquefaction, Cyclic direct simple shear, Post-liquefaction 
Volumetric strain, Residual strength 
Low plasticity silty sands are widely spread in the eastern plains of Taiwan. In 
contrast with well graded, clean silica sands, these silty sands show significantly 
different liquefaction characteristics due to the mineral composition and fines content. 
This study used the cyclic simple shear tests with embedded bender elements and low 
friction stack rings to conduct series of K0 liquefaction tests to investigate the 
liquefaction resistance, shear modulus, shear strain and post-liquefaction volume 
change of undisturbed and remolded silty specimens. The shear wave velocities of 
specimens will be measured by bender elements and used to evaluate the quality of 
the undisturbed specimens and consistency of remolded techniques. The undisturbed 
samples were collected in Kueiren area near Tainan city. Based on test results, 
different pore pressure generation patterns have been observed between undisturbed 
and remolded specimens. However, variations in liquefaction resistance and dynamic 
soil properties between the undisturbed and remolded specimens are insignificant. As 
a result, it is concluded that effects of sample disturbance is limited in liquefaction 
characteristics and dynamic soil properties for silty sand with high fines content in 
southern Taiwan. Monotonic shearing results indicate that undrained shear strength 
decreases as fines content increases from 0 to 20% and the minimum undrained shear 
strength observes around 20 to 35% fines content, which is in the proximity of 
transitional fines content. The trend reverses as fines content exceeds 35%. 
Additionally, fines content will lower the position of critical state line on p’-e plane 
and reduce the slope.

反覆單剪儀(cyclic direct simple shear, CDSS)與環剪儀(ring shear)之優缺點，三軸
試驗因大變形時應變不均、剪力面不在沈積(deposition)平面，及無法模擬流動時
主應力面旋轉，因此並不適合進行不排水剪力試驗，而較佳之試驗儀器為單剪儀
與環剪儀，單剪儀之缺點為側向缺乏補償剪應力導致應力分佈不均與大變形下頂

由於不同儀器有誤差，有必要進行不同試驗儀器之比較。Landon et al. (2007)建

於工程界進行現地液化分析使用。 
 
2.2 液化後體積應變 
目前液化土層體積應變之研究多以乾淨砂之重模試體進行動態三軸試驗而
來，研究顯示體積應變與初始相對密度與土壤所受之最大剪應變量相關(Nagase 
and Ishihara1988)，其中後者之影響最大，常用之評估法有Tokimatsu and Seed 
(1987)根據砂土所受剪應力比與相對密度、體積應變之關係，建立砂土層體積應
變與(N1)60 及CSR 之關係，及Ishihara and Yoshimine (1992)以抗液化安全係數、
相對密度、最大剪應變與液化後體積應變關係，但這些均適用於乾淨砂，對粉土
質砂之液化後體積應變，僅有Tsukamoto et al. (2004)利用大型三軸試驗，建立類
似於圖2之關係，其推測液化後體積應變隨細粒料含量增加而增加， 且最大體積

p 為不排水強度比(undrained strength ratio)，式(7)顯示不排水強度比僅與

steady state line 向下移動且其移動量受土壤粒狀影響，對乾淨砂，其不排水強度
比會受剪動模式(mode of shear)影響，以三軸壓縮、三軸伸張及扭剪(torsional shear)
得到之不排水強度比有顯著不同，由現地破壞案例反算分析顯示扭剪之結果較符

液化後不排水殘餘強度試驗多先將試體以反覆加載方式達到初始液化後再
進行單向加載，由於土壤膨脹(dilate)之故，其軸差應力隨著剪應變量增加而增

乾淨砂討論且相關實驗多以重模試體進行，Yusuhara et al. (2003)以三軸試驗進行
低塑性粉土震後強度與勁度折減，發現震後行為與應變震幅相關，但是其結論能
否代表現地土壤行為仍有疑問。 
Seed et al. (2003)提到 Poulos et al. (1985)以重模試體及 steady-state 推估現地
不排水剪力強度其常高估現地強度，主要原因為重模試體與現地土樣因為擾動、
壓密應力與密度差異因此需要極大修正值，且現地剪動模式主要為單剪狀態且有
土壤孔隙重分佈效應，因此若要以室內實驗求取現地液化後不排水殘餘強度應以
低擾動試體，壓密至現地應力狀態(K0)，並以單剪進行液化與液化後剪動。 
 
2.4 細粒料對臨界狀態參數之影響 
Casagrande (1940)對臨界狀態(critical state)的定義為在排水條件下，當孔隙
比、正應力與剪應力在剪動的過程中保持固定，則代表臨界狀態已達到。臨界狀
態之影響因子包括：試驗設備與加載條件、試體準備、排水條件、孔隙參數與初
始圍壓以及細粒料含量等，前人研究顯示試體準備方式及排水條件對於臨界狀態
的影響較小，孔隙參數與初始圍壓、試驗設備及細粒料含量對於臨界狀態的影響
較大，但文獻中細粒料含量對臨界狀態線的結果卻大不相同，而探討液化後殘餘
強度其應力為 狀態，因此進行 條件下之單剪試驗有其重要性。 0K 0K
 
三、 研究方法 
 
本子計畫為利用室內動態單剪進行重模與現場取樣試體進行 K0 狀態下反覆
單剪試驗，模擬現地土壤因向上傳遞之剪力波之產生反覆剪動，導致土壤液化及
液化後體積應變與殘餘強度等液化相關特性，可瞭解低塑性粉土質砂土因細粒料
導致液化特徵之差異，結合其他子計畫成果，可提供工程界進行抗液化分析與設
計時相關參數與程序。 
首先對選定之取樣場址，配合進行以表面波譜法量測試驗場址波速與幾何剖
面，並配合 SCPTU 與 MASW 試驗，決定現場土壤波速，作為後續試體取樣品
質與重模一致性比較之用。同時建立細粒料含量對剪力模數之修正參數，進而回
饋至現地波速量測時之砂層與粉土層之判識。

2.5 剪力波速變化與液化潛能評估 
本研究進行現地土樣與重模土樣剪力波速量測，從試體安裝後、壓密完成
後、液化時與液化後再壓密等階段，檢驗其變化並探討剪力波速與平均有效應
力、抗液化強度的關係。圖 5 為各試驗階段波速與平均值變化，由剪力波速量測
結果可以發現，在試體進行壓密前，土壤的剪力波速較慢，最大值接近 66m/s
而最小值為 14m/s，平均值為 42m/s，此階段因為土壤尚未受到顯著之壓密應力
作用，自薄管中取出之現地土樣處於解壓的狀態，而重模試體的組成較為鬆散，
因此剪力波速較慢。從壓密前剪力波速資料中，無法發現一致或是趨勢相同的特
性，無論是低擾動現地土樣或是重模土樣。當試體壓密完成後土壤剪力波速有明
顯的提升，顯示土壤剪力模數增加且平均約為 124m/s。在試體進行剪動液化試
驗時，隨著反覆應力的施加及孔隙水壓力激發，土壤的剪力波速會持續下降，從
壓密後平均波速 124 m/s 下降到液化狀態時波速約 74 m/s，液化會經過排水再壓
密，大多試體的剪力波速會回復到接近壓密完成後的剪力波速。利用壓密後波速
與 CRR 值，可與 Andrus and Stokoe（2000）之剪力波速液化潛能評估法進行比
較，圖 6 為本研究與 Andrus and Stokoe（2000）建議曲線之比較，得知本試驗數
據皆在液化區，表示本研究實驗結果合理，但 Andrus and Stokoe 之抗液化強度
曲線明顯較為保守。

ABSTRACT 
 
Pile-supported wharf is a general option in port design to provide lateral resistance and bearing capacity under both static and dynamic 
loadings. In situ large-scale physical modeling using surface wave generator was performed to study the dynamic soil-structure 
interactions in pile-supported wharves and to serve as a prototype for in situ monitoring station. A wharf model consisting of 2 steel 
pipe piles welded on a steel slab was installed on a reconstituted underwater embankment. Due to screening of stress wave, the two 
piles are subjected to different loading conditions. Data reduction procedures were developed to analyze coupled shear strain-pore 
pressure generation behavior, pile responses, and soil-pile interaction characteristics. The results proved that the physical modeling 
can capture the interactions among the induced shear strain, generated excess pore pressure, and dynamic p-y behavior around piles. 
Preliminary results also show that evolutions of dynamic p-y curve with excess pore pressure variations should be included in soil-pile 
interaction modeling. 
   
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Soil liquefaction is the most widespread seismic damage to 
port and harbor facilities because native soils or hydraulic fills 
in ports are generally loose, saturated, cohesiveless soils. Pile-
supported wharves, consisting of a soil or rock underwater 
embankment, a rigid deck above the embankment, and piles 
connected to the deck, are common waterfront facilities 
providing lateral resistance and bearing capacity under both 
static and dynamic loadings. Pile-supported wharf failures in 
liquefied soils had been found at the port of Oakland during 
the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake (Werner 1998) and 
Takahama in Kobe during the 1995 Hyogo-ken Nambu 
Earthquake (Tokimatsu and Asaka 1998). Previous studies 
reveal that forces applied on wharf piles during seismic 
loading can be divided into inertial forces induced by 
vibrations of superstructure and kinematic forces from the 
relative deformations of surrounding soil.  However, 
evaluations of inertial and kinematic effects in soil-pile 
systems involve highly complicated soil-pile-structure 
interaction mechanism, which remains a highly challenging 
issue in geotechnical earthquake engineering field.  
Techniques for analyzing soil-pile interaction in liquefiable 
sandy soils can be categorized into four branches: pseudo-
static analyses (e.g., Rollins et al. 2005), dynamic numerical 
simulations (e.g., Boulanger et al. 1999), laboratory physical 
modeling (e.g., Brandenberg et al. 2005), and in situ dynamic 
testing (e.g., Kamaji et al. 2005). The complexity of the 
mechanism and knowledge involved makes these numerical 
simulations require rigorous verifications. To improve the 
applicability of pseudo-static approaches and verify numerical 
results, large-scale physical modeling and long waiting field 
monitoring stations are required.   
Many insights of soil-pile interaction behaviors come from 
observations and interpretations of laboratory physical 
modeling. Techniques used in this category include 1g-
shaking table tests (Tokimatsu and Suzuki 2004) and 
centrifuge tests (Brandenberg et al. 2005). However, due to 
the complexity of in situ soil stratum, nonlinear soil responses, 
and disturbance from pile installation, in situ dynamic soil-pile 
interaction testing is preferred and sometimes the only option 
in evaluating the site specific liquefaction responses of pile-
support wharves. Rollins et al. (2005) and Kamaji et al. (2005) 
 Paper No. 1.09b              3 
(2005) had proven that the generated surface waves is capable 
of inducing shear strain amplitude greater than the general 
threshold shear strain level (~10-2%) and generating 
significant excess pore pressure.  
Preparation of wharf model  
A model wharf consisting of two steel pipe piles with pile 
heads welded on a steel plate was installed on a reconstituted 
underwater embankment to represent a pile-supported wharf 
on liquefiable soil. The dimensions of deck plate are 250 by 
100 by 1 cm with respect to length, width, and thickness. Each 
steel pipe pile is 350 cm long with a 20 cm outer diameter and 
0.5 cm thickness. The bottom 100 cm of piles was pushed into 
the native soil statically after trench excavation and the 
remained 250 cm was buried by the reconstituted soil. After 
the driving of piles, the deck plate was welded on top of piles 
as rigid connections and the horizontal distance between the 
two piles was 190 cm from center to center.  
To produce uniform, saturated soil stratum, the reconstituted 
underwater embankment was prepared by water sedimentation. 
The reconstituted soil was divided into seabed, underwater 
slope, and level backfill. The seabed and the level backfill 
were constructed from two ends of the trench and the 
underwater slope was formed in the natural rest angle of soil. 
A test trench with dimensions of 5.0 by 2.5 by 2.5 m with 
respect to length, width and depth respectively was excavated. 
Because native ground water table is below 3 m, a thin, 
impermeable membrane was placed on the excavated surface 
to prevent water leakage from the trench and maintain the 
saturation of the reconstituted soil. Soil borrowed from the 
nearby beach was used to prepare the underwater embankment. 
The borrowed soil is a non-plastic, clean, fine sand classified 
as SM soil in USCS classification with a specific gravity of 
2.66. Post-test borings confirmed that the spatial variations of 
void ratio and unit weight were small, indicating that the 
reconstituted soil was quite uniform. The reconstituted soil has 
an initial void ratio of 0.94 and saturated unit weight of 18.1 
kN/m3. Bender element tests on reconstituted specimens 
showed that the shear wave velocity at 1.25 m deep was 80 
m/s and the value was checked by travel time of wave 
propagation in the level backfill. This shear wave velocity 
corresponds to a normalized shear wave velocity (Vs1) of 156 
m/s, which will liquefy under small cyclic stress ratio (~0.1) 
for earthquakes of magnitude 7.5. 
Instrumentation  
To simultaneously monitor soil motions and pore pressure 
variations, the “coupled sensor” was fabricated by integrating 
a triaxial, low-frequency accelerometer and a miniature pore 
pressure transducer in an cylindrical, acrylic case of a size of 
55 mm in diameter and 78 mm in length. A triaxial capacitive 
accelerometer was used for measuring the local ground 
accelerations in the vertical and two orthogonally horizontal 
directions. Eight coupled sensors were deployed, as shown in 
Fig. 1, to form two 0.6 by 0.6 m square arrays on the vertical 
plane along the center line of the trench. Other embedded 
sensors include one coupled sensor placed near the top of the 
level backfill, another one in front of Pile B, and five 
piezometers (P39, 40, 41, 43, and 44) at the bottom of the test 
pit. 
Pile responses were monitored by strain gage pairs glued on 
opposite sides of a pile with 30 cm vertical interval to measure 
the induced bending strain profiles. Advantages of this type of 
strain gage layout include temperature compensation, 
cancelation of thermal effect of lead wires, removal of axial 
strain, and double magnitude of output voltages. Using an 
elastic beam theorem with proper end conditions, profiles of 
moment distribution, lateral displacement, and subgrade 
reaction on piles can be evaluated. Deck plate motion was 
measured by a triaxial accelerometer and used to verify the 
evaluated lateral displacements of piles. 
All the embedded sensors were installed before the water 
sedimentation process. Piezometers and coupled sensors were 
fixed at the designated locations with proper orientations by 
fishing lines after excavation. All fishing lines were cut prior 
to shaking test to make sensors move with the soil. A 
customized, stand-alone dynamic data acquisition system was 
used for these sensors. In the performed tests, data acquired 
from accelerometers and piezometers were collected at a 
sampling rate of 1000 Hz for better resolution in wave 
velocity determination by travel time interval and smoother 
integration for soil displacement and velocity calculations. 
Piezometer data were continuously recorded after shaking to 
capture the dissipation process of the excess pore pressures. 
Down-sampling technique was adopted in data processing to 
reduce data points of pore pressure time histories.  
Testing procedure  
A total of 15 test events were conducted to study the effects of 
loading amplitude, frequency, and soil properties on soil-pile 
interactions. Several small amplitude tests were performed for 
system check and wave velocity measurements. After each test 
event, surface survey was conducted to monitor the surface 
variations and induced settlements.  
DATA ANALYSIS 
Data collected from the embedded instrumentation include 
histories of particle motion, pore pressure, pile bending strain, 
and deck acceleration. These data were processed and 
analyzed to evaluate the temporal and spatial variations of 
shear strain and excess pore pressure induced in the 
embankment, horizontal pile deformations, subgrade reactions, 
and nonlinear soil-pile interactions. The data reduction 
procedure is show in Fig. 3 and details are described below.

strain gage pairs on opposite sides, s (z) is equal to n (z)

The horizontal displacement of soil is evaluated from 
numerical double integration of acceleration data. The relative 
displacements between the pile and soil were evaluated 
accordingly.

horizontal force of unit length, is calculated from:  
( , ) ( , )p z t q z t kD                               (8) 
 Combine the subgrade reaction from Eq. (7) and relative 
displacement between the pile and surrounding soil and, the p-
y behavior was established.  
Curve fitting functions with existence of second derivatives 
have been used to interpret lateral response of piles subjected 
to lateral loading. The cubic spline interpolation is used in this 
study with specified boundary conditions at both pile ends. 
Advantages of using cubic spline interpolation include: (1) 
passing every measured point smoothly, (2) avoidance of error 
accumulation with order of polynomials, (3) being applicable 
to limited data points, and (4) simplicity (Nakamura 1995). 
Because the top of the pile is welded on the steel deck and the 
deck move horizontally, zero curvature at the pile top is 
assumed. Although the pile is 3.5 m long, only the portion 
within the reconstituted soil (2.5 m) was measured and the 
bottom 1.0 m was penetrated in the native soil, which was 
neither liquefied nor subjected to large stiffness reduction due 
to small shear strain level. Therefore, a fixed portion of piles 
within the native soil is assumed. The curvature at the bottom 
of the test pit is linearly extrapolated from the lowest 
measuring point (0.14 m from bottom).  
The fitted curvature curves were doubly integrated to compute 
the distribution of lateral displacement and differentiated twice 
to estimate the profile of subgrade reaction in every time step. 
To minimize the effects of noise on numerical calculations, 
band-passing filter, which retained components with 0.5 to 1.5 
times of loading frequency, was applied on bending strain 
histories before numerical calculations. Verifications of end 
condition assumptions and filtering effects were conducted by 
comparing the pile head displacement amplitudes with the 
measured relative deck displacement amplitudes estimated 
from double integration of the deck acceleration subtracting 
the bottom displacement and the results are shown in Fig. 4. 
The average pile head amplitudes of the two piles, which take 
into account of the deformation of deck plate, agree well with 
the relative deck displacement amplitudes, indicating that the 
procedure for bending strain processing is adequate for 
displacement evaluation. Validation of subgrade reaction 
evaluation is more complicated. However, qualitative 
agreements in the observed soil-pile interactions provide 
certain degree of confidence on the evaluated results.

TYPICAL TESTING RESULTS 
Results from event 9, which is the first test with liquefaction 
occurred in the entire embankment, are presented to show the 
wharf responses in liquefied sand.Data of the coupled shear 
strain-pore pressure response and the temporal and spatial 
variations of excess pore pressure are presented to 
demonstrate the liquefaction process. Dynamic p-y behaviour 
is evaluated from piles and adjacent soil responses to represent 
the dynamic soil-pile interactions.     
Pore pressure variations 
The accumulated excess pore pressure histories of event 9, 
processed by low-passing 1 Hz, are shown in Fig. 5 along with 
the time of initial liquefaction. Variations of excess pore 
pressure at level backfill and bottom of test pit are presented in 
group to demonstrate the liquefaction process of the 
embankment. The initial liquefaction was first observed at 
CS5 (Fig. 5(a)), where relatively large accelerations were

Dynamic soil-pile interaction   
Profiles of bending strain, lateral deflection, and subgrade load 
of Pile A and Pile Bduring the largest response cycle in event 
9 are shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), respectively. The 
maximum bending strain/moment was observed at the middle 
of the pile (from 90 cm to 150 cm deep) then gradually 
decreased as the depth decreased. The displacement profiles 
show that the pile vibrated in the fundamental mode with fixed 
end near the bottom of the trench and zero curvature at the top. 
The subgrade load distributions shown in Fig. 8(a) indicate 
that a uniform subgrade pressure was applied at the middle 
section of the pile. The uniform lateral pressure section 
provides a better controlled condition in back-calculating the 
p-y response. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate that Pile A 
was mainly subjected to kinematic forces from surrounding 
soil due to stress wave propagation.  
However, responses of Pile B at the same time steps are 
different although the pile head displacements are close, as 
shown in Fig. 8(b). The response profiles of Pile B indicate 
that Pile B was under a pushover condition with forced 
displacement on top in which the inertial forces is more 
dominating. The non-zero subgrade load above the ground 
surface is numerical error due to limited measurement points 
in cases of a point load on pile head. The cause of different 
loading condition of Pile B is the outcome of screening effects 
and rigid connections of piles on the deck plate. Although the 
current configuration induced two different loading 
mechanisms of piles on same deck plate, it provides a testing 
technique that can study the two loading conditions in one test 
and could represent pile groups subjected to inclined waves.

Fig. 8. Response profiles of piles in event 9 
Figure 9 shows the dynamic p-y curves of Pile A at different 
depths with three excess pore pressure ratios calculated from 
adjacent pore pressure measurements in level backfill (P39, 
P40, CS5, and CS3). The hysteretic curve of p-y response is 
similar to the BNWF model proposed by Boulanger et al. 
(1999). These figures demonstrate that the dynamic p-y curves 
were significantly affected by the generated excess pore 
pressure ratio of surrounding soils. For clear demonstration, 
the evolution of p-y curves with pore pressure ratio variation 
at the depth of 1.5 m are combined and shown in Fig. 10. At 
low ru, the p-y curves behaved almost linearly due to relatively 
constant soil stiffness and stress amplitude. As the excess pore 
pressure ratio increased, the secant modulus of the hysteretic 
loops decreased, and the areas of the loops increased, 
indicating that subgrade pressures have reduced and damping 
effects have increased. The evolution of dynamic p-y is the 
outcome of reduced soil stiffness and change of soil 
impedance.  
Combining the results of coupled soil responses and dynamic 
p-y behavior revealed that soil stiffness variations due to pore 
pressure generation and induced strain level should be 
considered in dynamic p-y framework for liquefied sand. Also, 
the preliminary results proved that the testing configuration 
can capture major characteristics of pile-support wharf under 
kinematic and inertial excitations.

dynamic p-y concept should be modified for soil with 
significant excess pore pressure generation. 
The performed test has following advantages. First, it can be 
performed in the field to evaluate seismic resistance of active 
wharf and to periodically check the integrity of in situ 
monitoring system. Second, the instrumentation configuration 
and data reduction procedure can be compared to real 
earthquake loading in terms of soil responses and soil-
structure interactions. Third, the processed shear strains are 
directly related to engineering properties and rigorous in 
mechanics aspects.  Finally, the pile responses due to 
kinematic and inertial effects can be studied in one testing 
configuration. The shortcomings include less screening effect 
in real seismic loadings, more sensors required for strain 
calculation, more complicated wave field than shaking table 
tests and real earthquake loadings, and scale and boundary 
effects on state of stress and wave fields that encounter in all 
model tests. Nevertheless, the proposed tests can be an 
alternative to current large-scale physical modeling and useful 
insights of soil-structure interaction can be obtained.
