fractional bandwidth is 3.5% for the lower band and 12.3% for
the upper band. The dimension of the PCB is chosen as
50 × 45 × 0.4 mm3, which is a typical size for many handset
devices. The antennas on the PCB are fed by 50-V
microstrip. In the design, the antenna simulation is performed
using high frequency structure simulator (HFSS) [20].
2.1 Dual-feed single-slot antenna
Fig. 1 shows the proposed design of the dual-band slot
antenna with two feeding microstrips. For convenience of
circuit analysis, the antenna is considered as a four-port
network. Ports 1 and 2 are feeding microstrips, and ports 3
and 4 are terminated with a capacitor and a short circuit,
respectively. With the four-port S-parameters simulated by
HFSS, the values of the capacitor, length and characteristic
impedance of the microstrips can be easily determined by
using advanced design system (ADS) [21]. Fig. 2 shows the
simulated reﬂection coefﬁcient of the slot antenna in Fig. 1.
The simulated antenna peak gain is 1.9 dBi at 2.45 GHz
and 3.03 dBi at 5.3 GHz. To investigate the ﬁeld
characteristics, the distribution of the tangential electric ﬁeld
in the slot is simulated and shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that,
while the slot resonates at 2.4 GHz, a travelling-wave mode
is excited at 5.3 GHz, as indicated by the ﬁeld null moving
along the slot in Fig. 3b. To further study the conditions of
mode excitation, two lumped ports are set at ports 1 and 2
in the simulation using HFSS to obtain the phase difference
between the voltages at these two ports. As shown in
Fig. 2, it is found that the travelling wave occurs because
the port 2 provides an excitation lagging in time phase,
which is2bsl and bs is the phase constant of the slot line.
Adjusting the values of the capacitor in port 3 and the
length difference between the microstrips at ports 1 and 2
by using ADS until
−bsl = phase (V2/V1) (1)
The travelling-wave mode can then be excited.
2.2 Centre frequency determination
A series of simulations are conducted in order to ﬁnd the
mechanisms for determining and adjusting the centre
frequencies and bandwidths of the antenna. First, the length
of the slot is chosen to be about quarter-wavelength in the
lower band. Care should be taken to determine both port
positions, because any inappropriate change in the position
of either port could simultaneously cause variation in both
centre frequencies. In what follows, a simple procedure for
the centre-frequency determination will be suggested:
1. Port 1 is ﬁrst set to the position similar to that of the
feeding microstrip of the single-band design [19].
2. Fig. 4 shows the simulated reﬂection coefﬁcient of the
antenna in Fig. 1 with different positions for port 2. As can
be seen, both centre frequencies are simultaneously shifted
as port 2 is moved. Therefore the position of port 2 will be
adjusted until both centre frequencies are located
approximately in the vicinities of the lower and upper bands.
3. Fig. 5 shows the simulated reﬂection coefﬁcient of the
antenna in Fig. 1 with different sizes for the square patch
(i.e. different capacitances). As the size changes, the lower-
band centre frequency is shifted, whereas the upper-band

divider, two microstrips are denoted by MS1 and MS2. The length and
characteristic impedance are respectively denoted by L1 (L2) and z1 (z2) for
MS1 (MS2). For the rest of the paper, the widths of the two strips over the
slot are both 0.5 mm

stronger when it approaches the open end of the slot.
Therefore it is sufﬁciently effective to only widen the slot
of the section close to the open end to achieve the required
bandwidths.
2.4 Radiation pattern improvement
The long electrical length of the antenna may result in very
directional radiation which could be undesired in some
wireless applications. In the upper band, the 23.5-mm slot
is more than 0.75 wavelength, which is the main reason
why the simulated peak gain of the antenna in Fig. 8
reaches 4.18 dBi. Fig. 10 shows the simulated radiation
gain pattern in the x–z plane. It is found that the radiated
energy is mainly directed towards the PCB (2x direction).
The simulated averaged gains in the x–y, x–z and y–z
planes are 21.22, 20.75 and 24.2 dBi, respectively. To
improve the radiation performance, the slot is folded into a
J-shape slot to decrease the antenna length, and re-deployed
to direct the radiation away from the PCB. Fig. 11 shows
the antenna conﬁguration using a folded slot, and the
corresponding simulated reﬂection coefﬁcient is also given
in Fig. 9. The simulated peak gain is 2.88 dBi, and
averaged gains in the x–y, x–z and y–z planes are 22.59,
20.17 and 21.5 dBi, respectively. The length of the
antenna in Fig. 11 is less than 18 mm, which is
signiﬁcantly shorter than that of the antenna in Fig. 8, so
the antenna in Fig. 11 is less directional than the one in
Fig. 8. Also, energy is mainly radiated away from PCB
(+z and +x directions) for the antenna in Fig. 10. More
description regarding the radiation patterns of the antenna in
Fig. 11 will be given in the next section.
2.5 Effect of PCB area on antenna
The effect of the PCB area on the bandwidth and reﬂection
coefﬁcient of the antenna is also investigated in Fig. 12.
Although the antenna in the lower band is insensitive to the
PCB area variation, the upper-band bandwidth is not

4 Conclusions
A dual-band antenna design using a dual-feed monopole slot
has been proposed for WLAN applications. The novelties of
the proposed design are that the proposed single-slot
conﬁguration is less complex, the multi-band response is
excited by the specially designed feeding circuit, and a
travelling-wave mode is excited in the upper band. Good
agreement is obtained in the comparison between
simulation and measurement regarding the reﬂection
coefﬁcients and radiation patterns of the antenna.

Abstract  —  This paper presents a bandwidth-enhancing 
technique for the design of quad-band PIFAs (Planar inverted F 
Antenna). By using a simple parasitic metal strip, the bandwidth 
of a typical PIFA is considerably broadened. With the proposed 
technique, the bandwidths of all passbands can be easily 
adjusted without significantly affecting that of the others. In the 
paper, the proposed quad-band PIFA fabricated in the air 
substrate for GSM900/DCS1800 handset is first designed. Then 
a metal strip is placed along the PIFA, and a quad-band 
(GSM900/DCS1800/PCS1900/UMTS2100) antenna is obtained. 
The position of the parasitic strip is carefully studied and chosen, 
so the performance of the PIFA in GSM900 and DCS1800 bands 
is not affected by the strip. The measured bandwidths of the 
proposed antenna are 80 MHz (880-960 MHz, |S11| < -6 dB) in 
the lower band, and 475 MHz (1695-2170 MHz, |S11| < -10 dB) 
in the upper band. Other results such as the simulated and 
measured reflection coefficient, simulated current distribution, 
and measured antenna patterns and gains are also presented. 
Index Terms — Mobile Phone Antenna, PIFA, Parasitic 
Antenna. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Conventional planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) have 
been widely applied in the mobile phone as internal antennas 
for the dual-band or multiband operation at about 900 and 
1800 MHz [1]. For wireless wide area network (WWAN) 
communications, antennas are often required to cover several 
or all operating bands for the GSM900 (890-960 MHz), DCS 
(1710-1880 MHz), PCS (1850-1990 MHz), and UMTS 
(1920-2170 MHz) systems [2]. Therefore, multiband 
antennas for wireless terminals and small size are emerging in 
the mobile handset industry. Many studies and works have 
been conducted to obtain single feed antennas supporting 
multiband operation, such as PIFAs (planar inverted F 
antennas) using L-/U- shaped slots [3] branch-line slits [4] or 
LC resonators [5]. However, it is still difficult to improve the 
bandwidth, because most internal antennas are electrically 
small in size [6]. 
In the paper, we propose a multiband PIFA with a short 
patch. The design is rather simple and very suitable for mass 
production. The driven element has a capacitive load similar 
to that in [7]. However, instead of using a single parasitic stub 
as in [7], short stub is used here to further enhance the 
impedance bandwidth of the upper frequency band of the 
antenna, and therefore the proposed antenna can cover 
GSM900 and DCS/PCS/UMTS systems. The measured 
results of the fabricated antenna are compared by the 
simulated ones which were obtained by using Ansoft HFSS

II. ANTENNA DESIGN  
Figure 1 shows the configuration of the proposed antenna 
formed by a PIFA and a parasite folding stub. As shown in 
Fig. 1(a), the antenna occupies a volume of 50 x 15 x 8 mm3 
and is placed on a FR4 substrate of 100 x 50 x 1.6 mm3 
(system circuit board of the mobile phone). The antenna is on 
top of PCB of 3 x 50 mm2. The dielectric constant and loss 
tangent of the PCBs are 4.3 and 0.015, respectively. The 
antenna on the PCB is fed with a 50 Ω microstrip. Figure 1(b) 
shows the detailed dimensions of the proposed antenna.

antenna in Fig. 1 with various values of  (a) Lh and (b) Li. 
 
Software with various values of the length of the stub and 
folded length of the parasitic antenna. Lh is the length of the 
stub that is situated on the ground plane around shorting pin. 
Li is the length of another folded section. The dimensions of 
the proposed antenna are given as follows: Lh = 12 mm and  
Li = 4 mm. Figure 5(a) shows the simulated reflection 
coefficient for various values of the stub length of 4, 8, 10, 12, 
and 14 mm. The center frequency of the upper band is 
decreased as the value of Lh increases from 4 to 14 mm. 
Figure 5(b) shows the simulated reflection coefficient for 
various values of the folder length of 0, 2, 4, and 6 mm, the 
center frequency of the upper band is decreased as the value 
of Li increases from 0 to 6 mm.  
Radiation characteristics of the antenna are also studied.
