一、中文摘要 
崩積地層之鑽探調查非常困難，而其穩
定性又常由降雨入滲與地下水位所控制，利
用非侵入式的地電阻法輔助工址調查及以
電學性質監測地層之含水特性應該是值得
發展的方向。崩積地層及殘餘土內之含水
量、飽和度、與地水位，影響崩積層邊坡之
穩定性甚巨，而地層含水特性與電學性質
（包括電阻率與介電度）具有密切的關連
性，本計畫旨在發展以電學性質調查地層分
佈及監測崩積地層之含水量、土壤吸力、地
水位之技術。本計畫所採用之量測方法包括
時域反射（TDR）量測技術與地電阻影像剖
面技術（ERT），TDR 是以導波器探測頭量
測土壤之電阻率與介電頻譜，而 ERT 則可
以非侵入的方式量測電阻率之二維分佈。
ERT 雖可以非破壞性的方法進行大範圍的
2-D 探測，但單一電阻率量測值受到許多物
理性質所影響（如含水量、土壤種類及地下
水特性等），TDR 介電頻譜較能直接反應
土壤含水量與土壤種類。因此本研究首先建
立並改良 TDR 與 ERT 量測系統，建立崩積
土之電學性質資料庫，再推導崩積土層含水
特性與電學性質間之關係，並討論判讀 ERT
影像剖面資料之原則，最終目的希望能發展
適合崩積地層之 TDR 多功能邊坡監測系統
包括降雨量、含水量、土壤吸力、地水位與
變形，及可提供在空間上與時間上連續資料

Abstract 
Drilling in colluvium, and especially in 
talus, is difficult, relatively expensive, and 
often does not provide the geotechnical 
engineer with a complete profile of the deposit.  
Intense rainfall is cited as the most common 
triggering mechanism for landslides involving 
colluvium.  Hence, electrical geophysical 
methods hold great promise to supplement 
drilling data and determine hydrogeological 
conditions in colluvium.  The main 
objectives of this study is to develop electrical 
techniques for site investigation and 
monitoring soil water content, matrix suction, 
and groundwater level in colluvium.  
Methods utilized include time domain 
reflectometry and electrical resistivity 
tomography.  ERT is a non-destructive 
method that can estimate 2-D distribution of 
ground resistivity.  However, interpretation 
of the resistivity alone for soil properties is 
difficult because it is sensitive to many factors, 
such as water content, soil types and ground 
water characteristics.  TDR uses a waveguide 
probe to measure soil dielectric spectrum and 
resistivity.  The dielectric permittivity 
provides extra information for estimating soil 
water content and soil types.  This study will 
first establish and improve the TDR and ERT 
measuring methodology.    A database will 
be constructed for electrical properties of 
colluvial materials.  The relationship 
between soil water retention characteristic and 
electrical properties will then be established.  
Guidelines for interpreting ERT resistivity 
tomograms will be subsequently illustrated.  
The final goal is to develop a multi-function 
TDR monitoring system for colluvial slopes 
including rainfall, water content, matrix 
suction, groundwater level, and slope 
deformation.  An ERT monitoring system 
will also be developed to obtain information

form. Neglecting the resistance effect may lead to unreasonable in-
terpretation, especially for surveillance with long TDR cable. He-
imovaara et al. 2004 used the multi-section wave propagation
model Feng et al. 1999; Lin 2003a to invert for the spatial distri-
bution of water content along a TDR probe. They added the resis-
tance term in calculating the wave propagation parameters of co-
axial lines, but the resistance effect was overlooked for noncoaxial
lines. In the context of monitoring deformation of rock masses,
Dowding et al. 2002 developed a wave propagation model trying
to account for cable resistance and multiple reflections. Dielectric
dispersion was not considered since they only considered cable de-
formation. In their model, the wave equation is solved by the finite
difference method and transformed into frequency domain. A
frequency-dependent magnitude loss is subsequently applied in the
frequency domain and the resistance-attenuated signal is then con-
verted back into the time domain. The numerical model is very
time-consuming and potentially unstable. Moreover, the cable re-
sistance results in not only the magnitude modulation but also a
phase distortion, which was not taken into account.
The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient, complete,
and general-purpose TDR model that accounts for multiple reflec-
tion, dielectric dispersion, and cable resistance in particular. The
TDR model is parametrized and formulated to be concise and ge-
neric for all types of transmission line and sensing waveguide. The
formulation and calibration of the model are introduced first. Simu-
lations of groundwater level and deformation monitoring are used
as examples to demonstrate the power of the model.
TDRWave Propagation Model
TDR Physical System
A TDR measurement setup is composed of a TDR device and a
transmission line system see Fig. 1a. The TDR device generally
consists of a pulse generator, a sampler, and an oscilloscope; the
transmission line is composed of a lead coaxial cable and a sensing
FIG. 1—a A typical TDR configuration, and b the lumped circuit model for
an infinitesimal section of the transmission line.OPY [GTJ100012] 003702GTJ  
waveguide. The sensing waveguide may be a coaxial cable e.g., for0012] 003702GTJ  
deformation and groundwater level monitoring or a specially-
designed multi-conductor waveguide. The pulse generator sends an
electromagnetic pulse along the lead cable and the sensing wave-
guide directs the electromagnetic wave into the material under test
or environment to be monitored. Impedance change occurs when
the measurement waveguide is subjected to deformation or electri-
cal properties of the surrounding material change. The reflections
due to the impedance change are recorded for analyzing relevant
influential parameters. TDR waveguides for geotechnical applica-
tions can be grouped into three categories according to the measur-
ing principles.
1. Crimp type: The characteristic impedance of the cable is
determined solely by its cross-sectional geometry if the in-
sulating material between conductors remains unchanged.
Reflections of the electromagnetic pulse are recorded if the
coaxial cable is subjected to loadings and “crimped.”When
a coaxial cable is embedded in a rock or soil mass, it can be
used to monitor the localized shear deformation of the rock
or soil mass. It has been shown that the magnitude of the
reflected pulse is related to the amount of displacement
Dowding et al. 1988; Dowding and Huang 1994.
2. Interface type: Reflections of the electromagnetic pulse
occur at the interfaces of impedance mismatches due to
changes in the dielectric properties of the insulating mate-
rials. These interfaces may represent groundwater level
air-water interface or scouring depth soil-water inter-
face depending on the design of the waveguide. TDR can
efficiently be used to locate the positions of these interfaces
Dowding et al. 1996; Yankielun and Zabilansky 1999.
3. Dielectric type: A waveguide probe with impedance mis-
matches on both ends is inserted into the material of inter-
est. The electromagnetic pulse is reflected at the beginning
and end of the probe. The electrical properties of a material
include frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity 
and electrical conductivity .A travel time analysis of the
two reflections can determine the apparent dielectric con-
stant, while the electrical conductivity  can be measured
using the steady-state response, which is readily obtained
from the reflected signal at long time. The apparent dielec-
tric constant and electrical conductivity is related to the soil
water content and density Lin et al. 2000; Yu and Drnevich
2004. The complex dielectric permittivity represents the
combined effect of frequency-dependent dielectric permit-
tivity and electrical conductivity. The spectral analysis of
the TDR signal allows dielectric spectroscopy i.e., mea-
surement of complex dielectric permittivity at various fre-
quencies for studying soil-water interaction Heimovaara
1994; Lin 2003a.
TDR Mathematical Model—Lumped Circuit Model
The cable resistance becomes an important issue in practice. Al-
though a TDR mathematical model has been formulated in various
forms Feng et al. 1999; Dowding et al. 2002; Lin 2003a, the effect
of cable resistance has not been properly considered in the model.
To complete the TDR mathematical model, a resistance correction
factor is formulated within the modeling framework proposed by
Lin 2003a. To begin with, the TDR physical system is mathemati-
cally described by the equivalent distributed parameter, lumped cir-
cuit Ramo et al. 1994. We may characterize an infinitesimal sec-

Simulation of TDR Waveforms
An actual TDR system consists of a cable tester and a nonuniform
transmission line. The line is comprised of a coaxial cable, a tran-
sitional device or probe head, and a sensing waveguide. The re-
sulting transmission line equations became nonconstant-coefficient
differential equations. However, a cascade of uniform sections, as
shown in Fig. 2, could be used to discretize the nonuniform trans-
mission line. Each uniform section is characterized by Li, Zp,i, r,i
* ,
and R,i. In a line with sections of different characteristic imped-
ances, waves can be reflected and transmitted at the interfaces of
the sections. The propagation velocity is a function of frequency
since the dielectric permittivity of the insulating material depends
on frequency. The TDR waveform recorded by the sampling oscil-
loscope is a result of multiple reflections and dispersion. Once the
propagation constants and characteristic impedances of each uni-
form section are determined by Eq 5, the frequency response of the
TDR sampling voltage V0 can be derived, following Lin 2003a,
as
V0 =
Zin0
Zin0 + ZS
VS = HVS 7
where V0 is the Fourier transform of theTDR waveform; Vs is the
Fourier transform of theTDR step input; Zs is the source impedance
of the TDR instrument typically Zs=50 , Zin0 is the input im-
pedance at z=0, and H=Zin0 / Zin0+ZS is the system function.
As shown in Fig. 2, the input impedance Zinz is the equivalent
impedance when looking into the circuit from position z. The input
impedance at z=0 i.e., Zin0 represents the total impedance of
the entire nonuniform transmission line. It can be derived recur-
sively from the characteristic impedance and the propagation con-
stant of each uniform section, starting from the terminal impedance

open loop ZL= or a closed loop ZL=0. The form of system
function in Eqs 7 and 8 is identical to that presented in Lin
2003a. But, here the effect of cable resistance is taken into ac-
count and formulated as the resistance correction factor in Eqs 5
and 6, which will then be used for calculating the complete system
function by Eqs 7 and 8. Both the resistance correction factor A and
system function are complex numbers. The effect of cable resis-
tance introduces not only a magnitude modulation but also phase
modulus to the system function. The phase modulation was not
taken into account in the wave propagation model introduced by
Dowding et al. 2002.
Equations 7 and 8 provide the system function to simulate TDR
waveforms of any TDR measurement system which may consist of
different types of transmission lines and dielectric materials. For a
given TDR measurement system, we need to know the length li, the
geometric impedance Zp,i, the cable resistance parameter R,i, the
equivalent dielectric permittivity r,i
* of each uniform section of the
nonuniform transmission line, and the terminal impedances, ZS and
ZL to predict the TDR waveform. Let the voltage source of the TDR
be denoted by vSt, the sampling voltage of theTDR be denoted by
vTDRt, and the FFT algorithm by function FFT . The simulation
of a TDR waveform takes the following steps:
1. Determine the model parameters of each uniform section
including Li, Zp,i, r,i
* , and R,i.
2. Determine appropriate window size for frequency and time
to avoid aliasing in discrete Fourier Transform.
3. Apply the Fast Fourier Transform to the source voltage in
frequency domain VS=FFTvS.
4. Subsequently applying Eqs 6, 5, 8, and 7 to determine V0
in frequency domain.
5. Perform an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform vTDRt
= IFFTV0.
The proposed algorithm is fairly efficient. Unlike the finite dif-
ference method, the transmission line is divided into sections only
at places where line properties change. Only one element with pa-
rameters Li, Zp,i, r,i
* , and R,i is needed for a long section of uni-
form line, making it much more efficient than finite difference
method Dowding et al. 2002.
A few simple TDR simulations were performed to demonstrate
how the model parameters L, Zp, r
*, and R affect the TDR signal

electric property. As an example, Fig. 5 shows the laboratory setup
for water level monitoring. A water level sensing waveguide made
of an air-dielectric coaxial cable Andrew HJ5-50 was connected
to the 30-m lead cable described in the preceding section. A TDR
measurement with the sensing waveguide simply in air was taken
for calibrating the transmission-line parameters Zp, r
*, and R of
the connector and the sensing waveguide. The sensing waveguide
was then inserted into a water-filled tube. Two measurements were
taken for water levels at 20 cm and 30 cm from the cable end.
Traditionally, the tangent-line method can be used to locate the
air-water interface. A line parallel to the horizontal axis is drawn
tangent to the trace at a local minimum around the reflection. A
second tangent is drawn at the point of maximum gradient after the
local minimum of the TDR waveform. The intersection of this line
with the horizontal line determines the reflection point of the inter-
face Timlin and Pachepsky 1996; Klemunes et al. 1997. The
water levels calculated by the tangent-line method are 22.31 cm for
the 20-cm water level and 33.72 cm for the 30-cm water level. The
discrepancy is attributed to the ambiguity of the empirical tangent-
line method. As the cable length increases, the reflected waveform
becomes smeared as a result of the cable resistance. Hence, water
level cannot be accurately determined by the empirical tangent-line
method.
Precise water level can be back calculated from the measured
waveform using the wave propagation model with known
transmission-line parameters Zps ,rs
* ,Rs of the sensing wave-
guide. The sensing waveguide is divided into two parts, one filled
with air and the other filled with water. The complex dielectric per-
mittivity including the electrical conductivity of groundwater
may vary with temperature and contamination. Therefore, it is
more general to treat rw
* complex dielectric permittivity of the
water in the sensing waveguide as an unknown.With the capability
of full-waveform simulation, the water level and rw
* f can be si-
multaneously determined using the full-waveform inversion. In this
case, the monitoring system is divided into three sections of uni-
form transmission line: the lead cable, sensing waveguide in air,
and sensing waveguide in water see Fig. 5. For simplicity, the con-
nector is considered as part of the lead cable. Parameters
Ll ,Zpl ,rl
* ,Rl and Ls ,Zps ,rs
* ,Rs can be calibrated beforehand.
The remaining unknowns are Lsw and rw
* . Since the dielectric re-
laxation frequency of water is much higher than theTDR frequency
range, dielectric permittivity of water can be considered frequency-
independent in the TDR frequency range. The complex dielectric
permittivity of the water can then be written as

Figure 6 shows the waveform matching when the inversion con-
verged. Also shown for comparison in Fig. 6 are the simulated
waveforms when cable resistance is ignored R=0. The resulting
estimations of water level Lsw were 20.01 cm for the 20-cm water
level and 30.48 cm for the 30-cm water level, respectively. In addi-
tion, rw=79.9 and w=0.0323 S/m were obtained from the inver-
sion, which compares well with the expected values rw=80.2 and
w=0.0323 S/m determined by a three-prong TDR probe and
conductivity meter. This example demonstrates the effectiveness of
the wave propagation model to infer from the TDR waveform both
the interface of impedance mismatch and electrical properties of
the material in the sensing waveguide. The interpretation of scour-
ing and sediment monitoring may be treated similarly. When a
multi-conductor waveguide or TDR penetrometer is used for soil
measurements, the accurate wave propagation model also serves as
a precise kernel for inverting dielectric spectrum of soils. Long dis-
cussion of dielectric spectroscopy should be left for a separate
paper.
Crimp Type Example
The cable is crimped when subjected to localized shear. Conven-
tional data interpretation correlates amplitude of the reflection
spike at the crimp with the localized shear deformation. However,
the amplitude of the reflection spike is also greatly affected by the
cable length and the width of the crimped zone. These factors can
be effectively taken into account using the wave propagation
model, as will be demonstrated on a direct shear test. Figure 7 illus-

1. Introduction 
In light of great demand for soil moisture monitoring over a short time interval, the 
measurement of soil dielectric properties as a surrogate for soil water content has 
become the major technique for such a purpose, including time domain reflectometry 
(TDR) (Topp et al., 1980; Topp and Ferre, 2002; Robinson et al., 2003a) and 5 
capacitance methods (Dean et al., 1987; Paltineanu and Starr, 1997). TDR is typically 
more accurate due to its higher effective frequency, and often does not require a 
site-specific calibration. It can also provide accurate measurement of soil electrical 
conductivity in the same sampling volume (Lin et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008). 
Conventional TDR probes using bifilar or trifilar TDR waveguides have limited 10 
penetration depth, but new TDR penetrometers have been developed to overcome this 
limitation (Vaz and Hopmans, 2001; Lin et al., 2006a; Lin et al., 2006b). Despite the 
success of current TDR technology, the travel time analysis algorithm that is used to 
extract apparent dielectric constant (Ka) has not been standardized, and there is room 
for further improving the accuracy of water content determination. Three aspects 15 
associated with the travel time analysis are: (a) determination of reflection arrivals, (b) 
probe calibration, and (c) physical meaning or effective frequency of travel time 
analysis. These three aspects are briefly reviewed as follows. 
Different methods have been proposed to determine the reflection arrivals in travel 
time analysis. The first methodology is based on the so-called “tangent method” (Topp 20 
et al., 1980). The reflection arrival is located at the intersection of the two tangents to 
the curve, marked as point A in Fig. 1a and called “dual tangent method”. While the 
second tangent line can be drawn at the point of maximum gradient in the rising limb, 
the location to draw the first tangent line often lacks a clear definition. To facilitate 
automation, Baker and Allmaras (1990) used a horizontal line tangent to the waveform 25 
 4
in water (i.e. only for probe length) using the apex of the first reflection as the first 
reference start point could introduce a small error at low permittivity values. Locating 
start reflection by the dual tangent method and calibrating the probe length along, 
Mattei et al. (2006) showed that the dual tangent method (for locating the end reflection) 
gives inconsistent probe length calibration in air and water while the derivative method 5 
can yield consistent probe length calibration. The anomalous result provided by the 
dual tangent method was explained by dispersion effects. However, the dielectric 
dispersion of water is not significant in the TDR frequency range. We believe that the 
inconsistent probe length calibration with the dual tangent method was attributed to the 
error in defining the start reflection point. The approach proposed by Heimovaara (1993) 10 
using the air-water calibration is supported and used in this study. 
The apparent dielectric constant traditionally determined by the travel time 
analysis using a tangent method does not have a clear physical meaning and is 
influenced by several system and material parameters. Logsdon (2000) experimentally 
demonstrated that cable length has a great effect on measurement in high surface area 15 
soils and suggested using the same cable length for calibration and measurements. 
Neglecting cable resistance, Lin (2003) examined how TDR bandwidth, probe length, 
dielectric relaxation, and electrical conductivity affect travel time analysis by the 
automated single tangent method.  Effects of TDR bandwidth and probe length could 
be quantified and calibrated, but the calibration equation for soil moisture 20 
measurements is still affected by dielectric relaxation and electrical conductivity, due to 
differences in soil texture and density. Using spectral analysis, Lin (2003) suggested 
that the optimal frequency range, in which the dielectric permittivity is most invariant 
to soil texture, lies between 500 MHz and 1 GHz, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Robinson et al. 
(2005) investigated the effective frequencies, defined by the 10-90% rise time of the 25 
 6
TDR wave propagation model to show the correct method for taking account of cable 
resistance and guideline for selecting proper recording time. With the proven capability 
to accurately simulate TDR measurements, the TDR wave propagation model can be 
used to systematically investigate effects of dielectric dispersion, electrical conductivity, 
and cable length on apparent dielectric constant and effective frequency. Synthetic TDR 5 
measurements (waveforms) were generated by varying the influential factors in a 
controlled fashion. The associated apparent dielectric constants and effective 
frequencies were calculated and compared.   
 
2.1 Synthetic TDR Measurements (Waveforms) 10 
The behavior of electromagnetic wave propagation in the frequency domain can be 
characterized by the propagation constant (γ) and the characteristic impedance (Zc).  
The propagation constant controls the velocity and attenuation of electromagnetic wave 
propagation and the characteristic impedance controls the magnitude of reflection.  
The propagation constant (γ) and characteristic impedance (Zc) taking into account 15 
dielectric dispersion, electrical conductivity, and cable resistance can be written as (Lin 
and Tang, 2007)

 8
measurement system uses an open loop (ZL = ∞). The frequency response of the TDR 
sampling voltage V(0) can then be written in terms of the input impedance as

where V(0) is the Fourier transform of the TDR waveform (vt) ; Vs is the Fourier

(typically Zs = 50 Ω), Zin(0) is the input impedance at z = 0, and H=Zin (0)/( Zin (0)+ZS) 
is the transfer function of the TDR response.  The TDR waveform is the inverse 
Fourier transform of V(0).  
The synthetic TDR measurement system is composed of a TDR device, a RG-58 
lead cable, and a sensing waveguide. Possible mismatches due to connectors and probe 10 
head are neglected since the simplification will not affect the apparent dielectric 
constant. Tap water and a silt loam modeled by the Cole-Cole equation were used as the 
basic materials. It is understood that the Cole-Cole equation may not be perfect for 
modeling dielectric dispersion of soils, since additional relaxations at lower frequencies 
might exist and multiple Cole-Cole relaxations would be more accurate. Although 15 
multiple Cole-Cole relaxations might be mandatory for dielectric spectroscopy, the 
simple Cole-Cole equation was used to parameterize the dielectric dispersion for the 
parametric study of dispersion effect. The transmission line parameters and dielectric 
properties used in the parametric study are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. 
Time interval Δt = 2.5×10-11 sec and time window T = 8.2×10-6 sec (slightly greater 20 
than the pulse length of 7×10-6 sec in a TDR 100) were used in the numerical 
simulations. The corresponding Nyquist frequency (half the sampling frequency, 
sometimes called the cut-off frequency) and frequency resolution are 20 GHz and 60 
kHz, respectively. The Nyquist frequency is well above the frequency bandwidth of 
 10
permittivity, as suggested by Heimovaara (1993). It should be noted that different 
values of system parameters (t0 and L) may be obtained when different methods of 
travel time analysis are used.   
Two methods have been used to investigate the “effective frequency” of the Ka 
measurement. One method compares the Ka from the travel time analysis with the 5 
permittivity obtained from the frequency domain dispersion curve (Or and Rasmussen, 
1999; Lin, 2003). The other method is based on the 10-90% rise time of the end 
reflection (Logsdon, 2000; Robinson et al., 2005). To avoid confusion, the first 
approach is termed “equivalent frequency feq”. It is determined by matching Ka 
estimated from travel time analysis methods to the frequency-dependent apparent 10 
dielectric permittivity εa(f) (Von Hippel, 1954)：

where 'rε  is the real part of the permittivity due to energy storage and "rε  is the 
imaginary component due to dielectric loss. For determining equivalent frequencies in 
the parametric study, the real and imaginary permittivity as functions of frequency were 15 
known a priori from model parameters listed in Table 1 and Table 2. Unlike Or and 
Rasmussen (1999), the apparent dielectric permittivity εa(f) is used instead of the real 
part of dielectric permittivity to take into account effects of dielectric loss and electrical 
conductivity on phase velocity. The second approach is termed “frequency bandwidth 
fbw”.  It is defined by the 10%-90% rise time (tr) of the end reflection as (Strickland, 20 
1970) 
 12
the relation deviates from the 1:1 line. Figure 3c and 3d reveal the effect of cable length 
for zero EC. Similarly, cable resistance becomes an influencing factor when the 
material is dispersive. These results show that both EC and cable resistance play 
important roles for dispersive materials and Robinson et al. (2005)’s finding that the 
frequency bandwidth correspond with Ka of the derivative method holds only for 5 
limited EC and cable length values. In the context of soil moisture determination, 
whether Ka is the same as the calculated permittivity from the effective frequency is not 
critical, it is of more concern how Ka varies with influencing factors while the actual 
water content may remain the same. It is also of interest whether the effective 
frequency can provide useful information for compensating the effects of the 10 
influencing factors. Therefore, the subsequent discussions focus on variation of 
apparent dielectric constant and effective frequency as functions of EC, cable length, 
and dielectric dispersion.  
 
3.2 Effect of Electrical Conductivity 15 
The electrical conductivity is well known for having a smoothing effect on the 
reflected waveform and hence affecting the Ka determination. However, the degree of 
influence may depend on dielectric dispersion and the method of travel time analysis. 
Varying the value of electrical conductivity in water (as a non-dispersive case) and silt 
loam (as a dispersive case), Fig.4 shows the effects of electrical conductivity on Ka for 20 
different methods of travel time analyses. In the non-dispersive case, only the single 
tangent method is slightly affected by the electrical conductivity. Both the dual tangent 
method and derivative method are unexpectedly immune to changing electrical 
conductivity (see Fig. 4a). As the medium becomes dispersive within the TDR 
bandwidth, the apparent dielectric constant becomes sensitive to changing electrical 25 
 14
associated with electrical properties of the medium and cross-sectional geometry of the 
waveguide. The per-unit-length resistance is a result of surface resistivity and 
cross-sectional geometry of the waveguide (including cable, connector, and sensing 
probe), which is often ignored in early studies of TDR waveform by assuming a short 
cable. The cable resistance is practically important since significantly long cable is 5 
often used in monitoring (Lin and Tang, 2007; Lin et al., 2007). Not only does it affect 
the steady-state response and how fast the TDR waveform approaches the steady state, 
the cable resistance also interferes with the transient waveform related to the travel time 
analysis, as shown in Fig. 6 for measurements in water with different cable lengths. The 
“significant length” in which cable resistance becomes unnegligible depends on the 10 
cable type, which could range from lower quality RG-58, medium quality RG-8, to 
higher quality cables with solid outer conductor used in CATV industry. The RG-58 
cable is used for simulation in this study to manifest the effect of cable resistance and 
since it has been widely used for its easy handling.   
The measurements of water and the silt loam with various cable lengths were 15 
simulated. As an attempt to counteract the effects of cable length, the system 
parameters (i.e. t0 and L) were obtained by air-water calibration for each cable length. 
The cable resistance significantly distorted the TDR waveform. Consequently, the 
calibrated probe length increases with increasing cable length, as shown in Table. 3. 
Figure 7 shows the effects of cable length on Ka for different methods of travel time 20 
analyses. In the non-dispersive case (Fig. 7a), all methods are not affected by cable 
length if air-water calibrations are performed for each cable length. As the medium 
becomes dispersive within the TDR bandwidth, the apparent dielectric constant 
becomes quite sensitive to changing cable length (see Fig. 7b), in particular for the 
derivative method, even though the probe parameters have been calibrated by the 25 
 16
bound frequency below which the dielectric permittivity is equivalently non-dispersive 
and equal toε∞, and a higher bound frequency above which the dielectric permittivity is 
equivalently non-dispersive and equal to εdc. As frel increases from the lower bound 
frequency to the higher bound frequency, the apparent dielectric constant goes from ε∞ 
to εdc. In these relaxation frequencies, the derivative method yields higher Ka than 5 
tangent methods because its equivalent frequency is always lower than that of tangent 
methods. Comparing Fig. 9a with Fig. 9b, the lower bound frequency seems to decrease 
as Δε increases. That is, the higher the Δε, the wider the relaxation frequency range is 
affected by the dielectric dispersion.  
Also depicted in Fig. 9 are the associated frequency bandwidths as affected by the 10 
relaxation frequency. When the relaxation frequency is outside the frequency range 
spanned by the aforementioned lower bound and higher bound, the dielectric 
permittivity does not show dispersion in the TDR frequency range, and hence the 
corresponding frequency bandwidth is relatively independent of frel. The frequency 
bandwidth decreases as the relaxation frequency becomes “active” and reaches the 15 
lowest point near the middle of the “active” frequency range spanned by the lower 
bound and higher bound.  
 
3.5 Apparent Dielectric Constant vs. Frequency Bandwidth 
The effects of electrical conductivity, cable resistance, and dielectric dispersion 20 
were systematically investigated. These factors can significantly affect the measured 
apparent dielectric constant. The equivalent frequency would give some physical 
meaning to the measured apparent dielectric constant, but no method is available for its 
direct determination from the TDR measurement. Even if the equivalent frequency of 
the apparent dielectric constant can be determined, it may not correspond to the optimal 25 
 18
actual real part of dielectric permittivity near the optimal frequency range should be 
measured and used to correlate with water content. Dielectric spectroscopy 
(measurement of frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity) based on the full 
waveform model that takes into account the electrical conductivity and cable resistance 
can be used for such a purpose. However, dielectric spectroscopy is still not the state of 5 
practice due to its complex computation and system calibration. Future studies are 
suggested to simplify the TDR dielectric spectroscopy or develop signal processing 
techniques for determining dielectric permittivity near the optimal frequency range.  
 
4. Conclusions 10 
The apparent dielectric constant (Ka) derived from various travel time analyses 
(e.g. duel tangent, single tangent, and derivative methods) does not have a clear 
physical meaning. Although earlier study showed that Ka of the derivative method 
corresponds with the effective frequency determined from the reflection rise time, this 
finding is true only for limited EC and cable length values. Using numerical 15 
simulations, this study systematically investigated the influencing factors, including 
electrical conductivity (EC), dielectric dispersion, and cable resistance, and the 
associated effective frequencies.  
The material is perceivably dispersive in a TDR measurement when the dielectric 
relaxation frequency (frel) is within a frequency range. Within this frequency range, the 20 
apparent dielectric constant and frequency bandwidth (determined from the rise time of 
the end reflection) are sensitive to frel. Dielectric dispersion also plays an important role 
on how electrical conductivity and cable length affect Ka. In non-dispersive cases, Ka is 
not affected by EC, and effects of cable length on Ka can be accounted for by adjusting 
the probe parameters (i.e. the probe length and a constant time associated with arrival 25 
time of the incident wave) using air-water calibration for each cable length. In

solutions of different concentrations to EC measurements made 
with a conventional conductivity meter. To expedite calibrations 
for probes of different lengths, Reece (1998) proposed a method 
that measures cable resistance directly. Unexplained differences in 
EC accuracy between the calibration method and the direct mea-
surement method for cable resistance was observed, however, in 
Heimovaara et al. (1995) and Huisman and Bouten (1999). They 
suggested that the series resistors theory may be slightly incom-
plete and the fi tting procedure corrects the deviation from theory. 
More recently, Castiglione and Shouse (2003) demonstrated, both 
theoretically and experimentally, that the formulation based on the 
series resistors model is incorrect; however, their disturbing argu-
ments, while seeming logical at a fi rst glance, were in fact troubled 
by wrong assumptions and incorrect data. The assumption that the 
steady-state voltage varies exponentially along the cable (their Eq. 
[17]) and the data (their Fig. 5b) showing the effect of cable resis-
tance on TDR waveforms are not correct. In light of the wrongly 
claimed insuffi ciency of the series resistors model, they presented 
an intuitive method, in which the measured steady-state refl ection 
coeffi cients are linearly scaled between −1.0 and 1.0 with respect 
to the range expanded by the measurements in air (EC = 0) and 
under the short-circuited condition (EC =∞) before applying the 
Giese–Tiemann method. Despite the lack of a theoretical basis, 
the effect of cable resistance is inactivated through this linear scal-
ing process and the method is becoming widely accepted (e.g., 
Robinson et al., 2003). It should be pointed out, however, that the 
effect of cable resistance on the steady-state refl ection coeffi cient 
has never been proven to be linear.
The EC measurement by TDR, as easy as it may seem, remains 
a controversial issue, particularly when long cables are used. It should 
be noted that TDR is a high-frequency measurement technique 
with frequency ranging from kiloHertz to gigaHertz. The pulse 
length (i.e., duration of a single step pulse) is in the order of several 
microseconds. When TDR is used for determining DC electrical 
conductivity, it can only work for cases where the time required to 
reach the steady state is less than the pulse length. The time required 
to reach steady state strongly depends on the cable resistance. An 
arbitrary “long” time is usually used without close examination of its 
legitimacy. No work has been done on the effect of recording time, 
particularly in the context of long cables. In this study, a comprehen-
sive full waveform analysis and the DC analysis were conducted in 
a well-parameterized manner. The full waveform analysis was used 
to examine the theoretical validity of the series resistors model and 
Castiglione–Shouse method, and to investigate the effect of record-
ing time on these methods. It will be shown that the series resistors 
model is theoretically sound; the unexplained observations and dis-
putes in the literature may be explained by the time effect.
THEORY
Full-Waveform Analysis
While dielectric spectroscopy requires the full waveform, only the 
steady-state refl ection magnitude is needed for determining EC. With the 
capability of modeling the full TDR waveform, however, the theoretical 
validity of DC methods can be objectively examined. The effect of record-
ing time on the DC analysis can also be investigated numerically.
The wave phenomena in a TDR measurement include multiple refl ec-
tion, dielectric dispersion, and attenuation due to conductive loss and cable 
resistance. Wave propagation models for TDR have been formulated in vari-
ous forms (Feng et al., 1999; Lin, 2003), in which multiple refl ections, dielec-
tric dispersion, and conductive loss are taken into account. Neglecting cable 
resistance in these models was justifi ed by the short lead cable used. Cable 
resistance becomes an important issue in practice, however, when long cables 
are used. To complete the TDR mathematical model, Lin and Tang (2007) 
formulated a resistance correction factor (A) within the modeling framework 
proposed by Lin (2003). The frequency-dependent resistance correction fac-
tor is put in a different form here to express the individual contributions of 
geometric impedance and surface resistivity of conductors.
The behavior of electromagnetic wave propagation in the frequency 
domain can be characterized by the propagation constant (γ) and the char-
acteristic impedance (Zc). The propagation constant controls the velocity 
and attenuation of electromagnetic wave propagation and the characteristic 
impedance controls the magnitude of refl ection. Theγ and Zc, taking into 
account the cable resistance, can be written as (Lin and Tang, 2007)

where c is the speed of light, εr* = εr − jσ/(2πfε0) is the complex 
dielectric permittivity (including the effect of dielectric permittivity εr 
and electrical conductivity σ, in which ε0 is the dielectric permittivity 
of free space), Zp is the geometric impedance (characteristic imped-
ance in air), A is the (per-unit-length) resistance correction factor, j is

geometry and surface resistivity due to skin effect), and f is the fre-
quency. If cable resistance is ignored (i.e., αR = 0), A becomes 1.0 and 
γ and Zc have expressions identical to the nonresistance formulations 
(Feng et al., 1999; Lin, 2003). Each uniform section of a transmission 
line is characterized by its length, cross-sectional geometry, dielectric 
property, and cable resistance. These properties are parameterized by 
the length (L), geometric impedance (Zp), dielectric permittivity (εr*), 
and resistance loss factor (αR), as shown in Fig. 1a. Once these param-
eters are known or calibrated, TDR waveforms can be simulated using 
Eq. [1] and the modeling framework proposed by Lin (2003). The 
propagation constants and characteristic impedances of each uniform 
section are fi rst determined by Eq. [1]. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the 
input impedance at z = 0, i.e., Zin(0), represents the total impedance 
of the entire nonuniform transmission line. It can be derived recur-
sively from the characteristic impedance and the propagation constant 
of each uniform section, starting from the terminal impedance ZL:

where αR,i, Zp,i and Li are the resistance loss factor, geometric imped-

Although the probe constant β and cable resistance Rcable can be 
determined analytically from Eq. [9] and [10], Zp,i and αR,i are typi-
cally not known a priori. Using the full waveform propagation model, 
Zp,i and αR,i can be obtained (calibrated) from an inverse analysis 
of a single measurement in a sample with known electrical proper-
ties (such as air or pure water). Alternatively and more practically, 
Rcable can be directly determined from a measurement on a sample 
with known R, as suggested by Reece (1998). In the limiting case of a 
sample with R = 0 (i.e., TDR waveguide probe whose conductors are 
shorted together), the Rcable can be determined as

ment in which the conductors are shorted together. With known 
Rcable, the probe constant β can be obtained using Eq. [6] and at least 
one calibration test in a salt solution with known EC.
The series resistors model should be theoretically sound accord-
ing to the well-established circuit theory. Castiglione and Shouse 
(2003) presented an alternative approach for taking cable resistance 
into account, however, in which the steady-state refl ection coeffi cients 
are linearly scaled between −1.0 and 1.0 with respect to the range 
expanded by the measurements in air (EC = 0) and the short-circuited 
condition (EC = ∞):

 [12]
where ρscaled is the TDR measurement corrected for cable resistance 
by the scaling process; ρopen and ρshort are the refl ection coeffi cients 
with the probe in open air and short-circuited, respectively. The value 
of ρscaled represents the TDR measurement as if there is no cable resis-
tance, so the Giese–Tiemann equation (Eq. [8]) can be used for calcu-
lating the EC. Castiglione and Shouse (2003) claimed that the series 
resistors model is incorrect and Eq. [12] leads to better agreement 
with experimental results. It should be pointed out, however, that 
the scaling process is linear while the effect of cable resistance on the 
steady-state refl ection coeffi cient will be shown to be nonlinear. We 
examined both the series resistors model and the Castiglione–Shouse 
method using full waveform analysis and experiments.

the resistance effect was fi rst verifi ed by several TDR measurements 
with a 30-m RG58A/U cable. The TDR measurements were made 
by attaching the TDR probe (12-cm two-rod probe with conductors 
3 mm in diameter with 20-mm spacing) to a Campbell Scientifi c 
TDR 100 (Campbell Scientifi c, Logan, UT) via the 30-m-long lead 
cable and a SDMX multiplexer. Any uniform transmission line sec-
tion can be parameterized by the length (L), geometric impedance 
(Zp), dielectric permittivity (εr*), and resistance loss factor (αR). One 
of the three parameters (L, Zp, or εr*) needs to be known so that the 
other two parameters and αR can be calibrated from a measured TDR 
waveform (Lin and Tang, 2007). With known lengths, the transmis-
sion line parameters (Zp, εr*, and αR) of the lead cable and multi-
plexer section were calibrated by a measurement with the lead cable 
open ended. The transmission line parameters (Zp, L, and αR) of the 
TDR probe were then calibrated by a measurement with the probe 
immersed in deionized water, whose dielectric property is known. 
Using the calibrated transmission line parameters, TDR waveforms 
were simulated and compared with measured waveforms for the probe 
in open air, immersed in tap water, and short-circuited. Time interval 
Δt = 2.5 × 10-11 s and number of data points N = 65,536 were used 
in the numerical simulations (for details, see Lin and Tang, 2007). 
The resulting effective time window 0.5NΔt = 8192 (40Δt) = 8.2 × 
10-6 s  is slightly greater than the pulse length of 7 × 10-6 s in a TDR 
100. The corresponding Nyquist frequency and frequency resolution 
are 20 GHz and 60 kHz, respectively. The Nyquist frequency is well 
above the frequency bandwidth of the TDR 100 and the long time 
window ensures that a steady state is obtained.
Using the verifi ed TDR wave propagation model, the theoreti-
cal validity of the series resistors model and the Castiglione–Shouse 
method can be examined. The EC was numerically controlled and 
compared with that estimated from the synthetic waveforms using 
the Giese–Tiemann method, series resistors model, and Castiglione–
Shouse method. The time window used for these numerical simula-
tions was excessively large to ensure that a steady state was obtained 
and DC analysis was examined. As will be seen, the cable resistance 
can have a great effect on how the refl ection approaches the steady 
state. Intermediate refl ection plateaus at long times may be mistakenly 
taken as the steady-state refl ection coeffi cient. The effect of record-
ing time on the series resistors model and the Castiglione–Shouse 
method was investigated through a parametric study. Factors con-
sidered include lead cable length, probe length, probe impedance, 
and electrical properties of the material being tested. The simulation 
parameters used in the parametric study are listed in Tables 1 and 2. 
The resistance loss factor (αR) of the waveguide was set as 0.0 for all 
cases, since it has a negligible effect on the TDR waveform due to the 
short probe length.

RG-58 cable (200 m) was used for the numerical 
simulation. The steady-state refl ection coeffi cient 
with the 200-m RG-58 cable (αR = 19.8 s−0.5) 
is plotted against that without cable loss (αR = 
0 s−0.5), as shown by the solid line in Fig. 3. This 
curve is not a linear line and the scaled line by 
applying Eq. [11] is a nonlinear line rather than 
the 1:1 linear line. This disparity reveals that the 
Castiglione–Shouse method is correct only for EC 
= 0 and EC = ∞, since the effect of cable resistance 
on the steady-state refl ection coeffi cient is nonlin-
ear while the scaling process is linear.
In Fig. 4, the electrical conductivity in 
the measurement system was numerically con-
trolled and compared with that estimated from 
the synthetic waveforms using three different 
DC analysis methods. The result shows that the 
series resistor model is theoretically correct (if 
the true steady-state response is obtained), while 
the Giese–Tiemann method and Castiglione–
Shouse methods result in underestimation and 
overestimation, respectively. The overestima-
tion by the Castiglione–Shouse method linearly 
increases with EC, while the underestimation 
by the Giese–Tiemann method nonlinearly 
increases with EC. In Fig. 4, the probe con-
stant β is determined by Eq. [9], which is only 
a function of probe geometry and indepen-
dent of cable resistance. If the probe constant 
β is obtained using least square fi tting of TDR 
EC measurements in salt solutions of differ-
ent concentrations to conductivity measure-
ments made with a conventional conductivity 
meter, the result becomes that shown in Fig. 5. 
The linear overestimation by the Castiglione–
Shouse method is completely compensated for 
by the fi tted probe constant, while the non-
linear underestimation by the Giese–Tiemann

approaches the steady state strongly depends on the EC, as also 
suggested by Fig. 2. Two extreme cases, the probe in open air 
(EC = 0) and the probe with conductors shorted together (EC 
= ∞), are shown in Fig. 7a and 7c. Figure 7b shows the results 
for two electrical conductivities in between the two extreme 
cases. At high EC, the ratio vt/v∞ decreases monotonically and 
gradually approaches the steady state, while at low EC, vt/v∞ 
increases slightly above 1.0 and then quickly approaches the 
steady state. The medium EC is least affected by the record-
ing time. The defi nition of “high,” “medium,” and “low” EC 
here means EC that results in refl ection coeffi cient near −1.0, 
0, and 1.0, respectively. This property depends on the probe 
characteristics (i.e., geometric impedance and probe length), as 
can be inferred from Eq. [9]. For example, the EC may be con-
sidered “high” for a long probe but is considered “medium” for 
a short probe. When the waveguide is short-circuited, it takes 
a much longer time to reach the steady state even with small 
cable resistance, as shown in Fig. 7a. Hence, cautions should 
be taken when determining the cable resistance from the TDR 
measurement of a short-circuited probe using Eq. [11].
Four approaches may be used to determine the TDR 
EC from the steady-state response: (i) using the series resis-
tor model with cable resistance directly measured by the 
short-circuited probe (Eq. [11]) and a probe constant fi t-
ted to calibration tests; (ii) using the series resistor model 
with both cable resistance and the probe constant fi tted 
to calibration tests; (iii) using the Castglione–Shouse 
method with an actual probe constant determined by Eq. 
[9] or calibrated with a very short cable; and (iv) using the 
Castiglione–Shouse method with a probe constant fi tted 
to calibration tests. Figure 8 reveals the effect of record-
ing time on estimated EC using these four different 
approaches, in which the estimated EC of any recording 
time is expressed as σt. In this illustration, calibrations were 
performed with EC ranging from 0 to 0.2 S m−1 with 
0.02 S m−1 spacing. The fi tted probe constant is the probe 
constant that results in the minimum least square error 
between estimated and actual EC in the fi tting range. It 
coincides with the theoretical probe constant only when 
the series resistors model is used and the recording time 
is representative of the steady state. As shown in Fig. 8, 
the estimated EC by the series resistors model eventually 
converges to the true value, but the rate of convergence 
depends on the calibration method, the cable length, and 
the EC. The results for fi tting both the probe constant and 
cable resistance (Fig. 8b) increase the estimation accuracy 
slightly for each recording time, but the convergence trend 
is similar to that for fi tting only the probe constant, with 
cable resistance directly measured by the short-circuited 
probe (Fig. 8a). The time window required to have accurate 
estimation of EC increases with cable length, as expected, 
and is generally less than that required to reach the steady 
state due to the fi tted probe constant. Unlike what Fig. 7b 
may suggest, however, high EC converges to the true value 
faster than low EC does. This is due to the fact that TDR 
EC measurements are affected by the recording time not 
only when making measurements but also when fi tting the 
probe constant and cable resistance. As shown in Fig. 7, 
the TDR response approaches the steady state in different 
ways for different electrical conductivities. Depending on the fi tting 
range and data sampling, the fi tted probe constant may work in 
favor of some electrical conductivities. But of most importance is 
how to obtain accurate estimation for all electrical conductivities. 
The recording time is expressed as the time that includes multiples 
of roundtrip travel time in the probe section (t0) in Fig. 8. The same 
result is plotted in Fig. 9 with recording time expressed as multiples 
of roundtrip travel time in the lead cable (tcable). Except for the case 
of a very short lead cable, accurate estimation of EC can be obtained 
with a recording time greater than 3tcable, regardless of the fi tting 
range for the probe constant. The characteristic impedance of the 
lead cable increases with increasing cable length, giving rise to mul-
tiple refl ections within the lead cable, as shown in Fig. 2a. The con-
vergence of EC estimation is governed by multiple refl ections in the 
sensing probe for a short lead cable, while it becomes dominated by 
multiple refl ections in the lead cable for a long lead cable. A simple 
guideline for selecting an appropriate recording time can be drawn 
from the parametric study. To determine the EC accurately, the 
recording time should be taken after 10 multiple refl ections within 
the probe and three multiple refl ections within the lead cable. Errors

At EC = 0, the steady-state response is not affected by the 
cable resistance. But as EC increases, cable resistance gives rise 
to a growing increase in the steady-state response. Hence, the 
TDR EC measurements are increasingly underestimated by the 
Giese–Tiemann method as EC increases. This effect of cable 
resistance can be precisely captured and taken into account by 
the series resistors model, which is theoretically sound accord-
ing to the well-established circuit theory and verifi ed by the 
full waveform analysis. The alternative Castiglione–Shouse 
method, in which the measured steady-state refl ection coeffi -
cients are linearly scaled between −1.0 and 1.0 with respect to 
the range expanded by the measurements in air (EC = 0) and 
under the short-circuited condition (EC = ∞), on the other 
hand, was shown to be incorrect. This can be explained by the 
fact that the effect of cable resistance on the steady-state refl ec-
tion coeffi cient is nonlinear while the scaling process is linear. 
The error using the Castiglione–Shouse method may be com-
pletely compensated for if the probe constant β is obtained 
using least square fi tting of TDR EC measurements to known 
EC values or to EC measurements made with a conventional 
conductivity meter. The fi tted probe constant then becomes a 
function of cable length (resistance).
The cable resistance affects not only the steady-state 
response but also the time required to approach the steady 
state. The characteristic impedance of the lead cable has a fre-
quency-dependent increase due to cable resistance, resulting in 
a rising step pulse and multiple refl ections within the cable sec-
tion. Hence, it takes a much longer time than conventionally 
thought to reach the steady state when long cables are used, 
in particular at very low and very high EC. To determine the 
electrical conductivity accurately, the recording time should be 
taken after 10 multiple refl ections within the probe and three 
multiple refl ections within the lead cable.

were attributed to the time effect. It takes much longer time 
than conventionally thought to reach a steady state when long 
cables are used, in particular at very high EC. To determine 
the EC accurately, the recording time should be taken after 10 
multiple refl ections within the probe and three multiple refl ec-
tions within the lead cable for EC ranging from 0 to 0.2 S m−1 
(Lin et al., 2007). Much longer time is required to directly 
determine the cable resistance using the short-circuited probe.
Some errors may still be observed, particularly at low EC, 
using the procedure suggested by Lin et al. (2007). Typically, 
these errors are not obvious because calibration of the cable 
resistance requires measurements at high EC. It is not reason-
able to attribute these errors and unexplained observations in 
the literature regarding the series resistors model to the time 
effect alone. In this study, we argue that these errors are related 
to inaccuracy in determining the refl ection coeffi cient. The ρ∞ 
of a measurement in air (i.e., open circuit without any conduc-
tion) is theoretically 1.0 regardless of the cable length; however, 
this is not the case for many TDR devices, resulting in non-
zero EC at the zero-EC condition. For example, the ρ∞ of our 
TDR100 units open in air range from 0.95 to 0.97. Typical 
fl uctuations between 0.96 and 1.00 are the best the manufac-
turer can do with the technology they are using (Campbell 
Scientifi c, personal communication, 2007). The objective of 
this study was to complement Lin et al. (2007) to clarify that 
the series resistors model is indeed accurate and that the non-
zero EC problem in air is due to something else—instrument 
error in defi ning the refl ection coeffi cient for TDR EC mea-
surement. A calibration (correction) method is proposed, lead-
ing to an accurate and theoretically sound procedure for TDR 
EC measurement.
THEORY
The transmission line in a TDR measurement system is com-
posed of a lead coaxial cable (including connectors) and a sensing 
waveguide, as shown in the classical model in Fig. 1a. The transmis-
sion line is driven by a step source voltage vS(t) of height vS0 with a 
source impedance RS and terminated in a load ZL. A typical TDR 
measurement system uses a 50 Ω source impedance and has an open 
termination with ZL = ∞.
Incident Step Pulse and Refl ection Coeffi cient
The TDR waveform is the voltage v(t) sampled at the beginning 
of the transmission line. A typical TDR waveform is shown in Fig. 1b. 
It starts with an incident step of height vi followed by added refl ections 
and eventually reaches the steady state v∞. Consider the characteristic 
impedance of the leading transmission line a constant Zc (i.e., no dielec-
tric dispersion or conductive loss) and let its length be infi nitely long 
(i.e., the condition of no subsequent refl ections). Then, the incident 
step as a function of the source step can be derived as (by substituting l 
= ∞ into Eq. [4] or Zin(0) = Zc into Eq. [5] in Lin [2003])

where Zc is the characteristic impedance of the leading transmission 
line, RS is the source impedance, and vS0 is the height of the source step 
voltage. The characteristic impedance of the leading transmission line is 
typically designed to match the source impedance such that vi = vS0/2.
If there is a mismatch in the transmission line, a refl ected wave 
will originate at the mismatch interface and propagate back up the 
line toward the source, as shown in Fig. 2a. The degree of mismatch is 
indicated by the ratio of the refl ected wave to the incident wave. This 
ratio is called the voltage refl ection coeffi cient, ρ, and is related to the 
transmission line impedance by

The underestimation is maximal at zero EC (e.g., TDR probe open 
in air) when ρ′ = 1. This phenomenon is often mistakenly interpreted 
as the effect of cable resistance. The effect of instrument error on the 
estimated TDR EC is shown in Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c for high and low 
EC, respectively. Using the actual probe constant (e.g., Kp = 8.93 for 
the probe used in this study) and condition of zero cable resistance in 
Eq. [7], the instrument error results in an overestimation of EC. This 
is particularly evident in the low-EC range. The overestimation may 
be minimized by fi tting the probe constant instead of using the actual 
probe constant. However, the fi tted Kp will now depend on the EC 
range used for calibration (see Fig. 4b and 4c). Although the fi tted 
Kp is only slightly lower than the actual one and small errors of the 
estimated TDR EC are not noticeable in the high-EC range, the fi t-
ted Kp is signifi cantly lower and errors of the estimated TDR EC are 
obvious in the low-EC range. Typically, one would determine the Kp 
with the high-EC measurements (e.g., Kp = 8.62) and apply it also to 
the low-EC data, resulting in considerable errors in the low-EC range, 
as shown in Fig. 4c.
From Eq. [7a], the EC-associated refl ection coeffi cient ρ′∞ in the 
case of zero EC should be 1.0 regardless of cable resistance. Therefore, 
the zero-EC ρ∞ obtained by a measurement with the TDR probe in 
air or simply disconnected, denoted by ρ∞,air, can be used to cor-
rect the instrument refl ection coeffi cient. The calibration equation to 
transform instrument refl ection coeffi cients into EC-associated refl ec-
tion coeffi cients can be derived from Fig. 4 as

Scaled Refl ection Coeffi cient for

Once the instrument refl ection coeffi cient is calibrated by Eq. [9], 
Eq. [7] can be used directly for determining EC. In another form, the 
steady-state refl ection coeffi cient can be scaled taking into account the 
instrument error and cable resistance such that the Giese–Tiemann

the steady-state refl ection coeffi cient is linearly scaled between −1.0

however, the amount of increase reduces nonlinearly with increasing 
ρ′∞ and vanishes at zero EC (ρ′∞ = 1). This nonlinear effect can-

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A TDR device may output voltage (e.g., a Tektronix 
1502C) or the refl ection coeffi cient (e.g., a Campbell Scientifi c 
TDR100). To determine EC, v∞/vS0 in Eq. [4] or ρ′∞ in 
Eq. [7a] should be known. The source-step voltage vS0 of a 
voltage-output TDR device is simply equal to the v∞ when 
the TDR probe is open in air, which then serves as the refer-
ence voltage for computing the EC. The original TDR wave-
form v(t) of a voltage-output TDR device is often converted 
to ρ(t) by applying Eq. [2], in which the incident step vi is 
determined by using a 50 Ω cable or terminating block as the 
impedance reference and for amplitude calibration. Figure 6a 
shows a group of TDR waveforms ρ(t) from the 1502C device, 
in which the front panel and a 10-m lead cable are shorted, 
open, and terminated with a nominal 50 Ω terminating block. 
The front panel terminated with a 50-Ω terminating block was 
used for amplitude calibration such that its refl ection coeffi -
cient at long times is equal to 0.0. In this case, the steady-
state refl ection coeffi cient ρ∞ is 0.995 for the probe open in 
air, regardless of the cable length. It is not precisely 1.0 due 
to an imperfect match between the source impedance and the 
terminating block. This refl ection coeffi cient corresponds to 
0.0045 dS m−1 for the TDR probe used in this study, a small 
EC error in the condition of zero EC. The ρ∞ for the shorted 
front panel not being −1.0 is attributed to some internal resis-
tance. The ρ∞ for a shorted cable increases as cable length 
increases. The amount of increase in ρ∞ due to cable resistance 
reduces nonlinearly with increasing ρ∞ and vanishes at ρ∞ = 1. 
Applying the calibration Eq. [9], the corrected refl ection coeffi -
cient ρ′∞(t) can be obtained as shown in Fig. 6b. The corrected ρ′∞ becomes 1.0 under the condition of zero EC. The degree 
of imperfect match between the source impedance and the ter-
minating block is indicated by ρ′∞ = 0.0025 in Fig. 6b. A TDR 
device that outputs the refl ection coeffi cient uses the nominal 
50 Ω internal cable as the impedance reference and for ampli-
tude calibration. Analogous to Fig. 6, Fig. 7 shows a group of 
TDR waveforms ρ(t) from the TDR100 device. The mismatch 
between the reference impedance and source impedance in the 
TDR100 is more signifi cant, leading to ρ∞ = 0.950 (corre-
sponding to EC = 0.046 dS m−1) for the open front panel and 
ρ∞ = 0.961 for the probe open in air as shown in Fig. 7a. The

Unlike what was claimed in Castiglione and Shouse (2003), 
the series resistors model is theoretically sound. Errors observed 
when using the series resistors model can be attributed to the 
instrument error due to imperfect amplitude calibration and 
insuffi cient recording time for the steady state. In this study, a 
countermeasure against the instrument error was proposed to 
complete the series resistors model in practice. The measure-
ments involved in the Castiglione–Shouse method and the new 
method presented here are identical. The Castiglione–Shouse 
method works well if the probe constant is calibrated for each 
measurement setup, which involves measurements in some 
electrolytic solutions with known electrical conductivities for 
all probes even if they are identically manufactured. The probe 
constant in the corrected series resistors model is indepen-
dent of the cable resistance. Only one calibration is needed to 
determine the probe constant of identical probes with vary-
ing cable lengths. Finally, we would like to urge that the use 
of the Castiglione–Shouse scaling method be discontinued. 
We feel that it is inappropriate to use a theoretically incorrect 
approach, despite the fact that the results obtained with the 
incorrect approach are as accurate as the results of the theoreti-
cally sound approach derived here.

ABSTRACT : Up-hole time domain reflectometry (TDR) devices that interrogate
passive mechanical transducers are advantageous for engineering monitoring in situ.
This technology is based on transmitting an electromagnetic pulse through a coaxial
cable connected to a sensing waveguide and watching for reflections of this transmission
due to changes in characteristic impedance along the waveguide. Depending on the
design of the wave guide and analysis method, the reflected signal can be used to
monitor various engineering parameters. This paper introduces some recent
developments to improve the understanding and extend the usefulness of TDR
technology. TDR waveguides for engineering monitoring are grouped into three
categories according to the sensing principle, namely interface type, crimp type, and
dielectric type. New design concepts and data reduction procedures for each type of
waveguide are introduced. These developments improve and lead to a variety of
transducers, such as water level, deformation, rainfall, scouring, soil moisture, sediment
concentration, and electrical conductivity. The versatility and merits of TDR are
highlighted by examples of hybrid economical TDR monitoring systems composed of a
single TDR device and multiple sensing waveguides.

3FIG. 1. A typical TDR configuration
1. Crimp type: The characteristic impedance of the cable is determined solely by its
cross-sectional geometry if the insulating material between conductors remains
unchanged. Reflections of the electromagnetic pulse are recorded if the coaxial
cable is deformed or "crimped". When a coaxial cable is embedded in a rock or soil
mass, it can be used to monitor the localized shear deformation of the rock or soil
mass (Dowding et al. 1988).
2. Interface type: Reflections of the electromagnetic pulse occur at the interfaces of
impedance mismatches due to changes in the dielectric properties of the insulating
materials. These interfaces may represent ground water level (air-water interface)
or scouring depth (soil-water interface) depending on the design of the waveguide.
TDR can efficiently be used to locate the positions of these interfaces (Dowding et
al. 1996; Yankielun and Zabilansky 1999).
3. Dielectric type: A waveguide probe with impedance mismatches on both ends is
inserted into the material of interest. The electromagnetic pulse is reflected at the
beginning and end of the probe. The electrical properties of a material include
frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity () and electrical conductivity (). A
travel time analysis of the two reflections can determine the apparent dielectric
constant, while the electrical conductivity () can be measured using the steady-
state response (Robinson et al. 2003). The apparent dielectric constant and
electrical conductivity are related to the soil water content and density (Lin et al.
2000; Yu and Drnevich 2004). The dielectric spectrum may be determined by the
spectral analysis of TDR signal for studying soil-water interaction (Lin 2003a).
COMPREHENSIVE TDR WAVE PROPAGATION MODEL
The behavior of electromagnetic wave propagation in a uniform transmission line
can be characterized by the propagation constant () and the characteristic impedance
(Zc). The propagation constant controls the velocity and attenuation of electromagnetic
wave propagation and the characteristic impedance controls the magnitude of reflection.
The propagation constant () and characteristic impedance (Zc) taking into account the
cable resistance can be written in the frequency domain as (Lin and Tang, 2007)
5represents the total impedance of the entire non-uniform transmission line. It can be
derived recursively from the characteristic impedance and the propagation constant of
each uniform section, starting from the terminal impedance ZL:

where Zc,i, i, and li, are the characteristic impedance, propagation constant, and length of
each section, respectively, and ZL is the terminal impedance. A typical TDR
measurement system uses an open loop (ZL = ). The frequency response of the TDR
sampling voltage V(0) can then be written in terms of the input impedance as

where V(0) is the Fourier transform of the TDR waveform (vt) ; Vs is the Fourier
transform of the TDR step input; Zs is the source impedance of the TDR instrument
(typically Zs = 50 ), Zin(0) is the input impedance at z = 0, and H=Zin (0)/( Zin (0)+ZS) is
the transfer function of the TDR response. The TDR waveform is the inverse Fourier
transform of V(0). Inversion for transmission line parameters or material properties can
be done based on this full waveform modeling.
DIELECTRIC TYPE MEASUREMENTS
A typical TDR waveform is shown in Fig 3a. The apparent dielectric constant (Ka) is
determined by the apparent traveltime (t0), while the electrical conductivity (EC) can be
determined by the steady state response (v). However, cable resistance and recording
time are important factors to TDR EC measurements when long lead cables are used.
The cable resistance affects not only the steady state response but also the time required
to approach the steady state. Fig. 3b shows measurements using a long cable and
corresponding numerical predictions based on the comprehensive TDR model. The
characteristic impedance (Zc) of the lead cable has a frequency-dependent increase due to
cable resistance (denoted by Rcable), resulting in a rising step pulse and multiple
reflections within the cable section. Hence, it takes much longer time than

Current TDR multiple-rod probes are made for near surface applications. To make

measuring dielectric constant and electrical conductivity during cone penetration was
developed (Lin et al. 2006a and 2006b). A TDR penetrometer is formed by placing a

based on the comprehensive TDR model.

CRIMP TYPE MEASUREMENTS
Time domain reflectometry (TDR) technology has become a valuable tool for
detecting displacements and locating shear planes in rock or soil slopes. However, early
detection of localized shear deformation in soft soils and quantifying the shear
displacement using TDR remains a challenge. TDR response from localized shear
deformation is affected by cable resistance, soil-grout-cable interaction, and shear
bandwidth, as shown in Fig. 9a. A simple procedure using the TDR wave propagation
model was recently introduced for correcting the effect of cable resistance (Lin et al.
2006c). Only one calibration measurement for cable properties is needed to generate the
resistance correction curve for each type of cable. In addition, a direct physical model is
needed to obtain better understanding of the effects of soil-grout-cable interaction and
shear bandwidth on the TDR response. A large direct shear device, 25 cm square and 50
cm long, is illustrated in Fig. 9b. To extend the TDR applicability in soft soils, efforts
have been directed to establishing a compliant cable-grout composite (Dowding et al.
2001). However, the physical model tests show that the deformation required to kink the
sensing cable without a grout (i.e. perfect compliance) is greater than that required to
fracture the grout. Once the grout is fractured, cable deformity becomes more sensitive

TDR MONITORING SYSTEMS
The output of a time domain reflectometer is digital data, which can be easily
manipulated and communicated by a computer or a data logger. A communication
module can be used with the data logger for remote monitoring. Figure 10 illustrates
example configurations for landslide and bridge monitoring. The TDR can also play
important roles for geo-environmental, agricultural, and water resource problems. The
multiple-use TDR monitoring system may use a single up-hole or surface device to
continuously interrogate multiple physical parameters at multiple points through a
multiplexer. Both the reliability and economy are achieved in such a system.
Simultaneous measurements of these parameters are precious for the stability analysis
and for understanding the dynamics of the process.
CONCLUSIONS
Increasing application of time domain reflectometry (TDR) in geotechnical
measurements and monitoring, is driving the demand for an accurate TDR wave
propagation model. An efficient, complete, and general-purpose TDR model was
developed to account for multiple reflection, dielectric dispersion, and cable resistance
all together. Many new applications and more reasonable data interpretations may be
developed with the assistance of the TDR wave propagation model. A single up-hole or
surface time-domain reflectometer can be used to interrogate multiple physical
parameters, such as water level, deformation, rainfall, scouring, soil moisture, sediment
concentration, and electrical conductivity, at multiple points through multiplexers,
leading to an economical and reliable hybrid TDR monitoring system for a particular
engineering problem. Examples of such hybrid TDR monitoring system are given for
slope and bridge monitoring.
