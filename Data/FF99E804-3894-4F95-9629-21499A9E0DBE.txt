Abstract 
The thermal reflow process is widely used in microlens array fabrication. However, the most 
common criticism of the thermal reflow process is the low fill-factor for the microlens array. In 
this work, the caulking process is applied to fill the gap between two adjacent lenses. The 
experimental results proved that a gapless microlens array with a maximum 100% fill factor 
could be successfully produced and the caulking time precisely controlled. Furthermore, the 
artificial neural network and genetic algorithm are used to achieve a high quality microlens array 
fabrication using the thermal reflow and caulking processes. The 18L  orthogonal array is used as 
the learning data for the artificial neural network to construct a system model that could predict 
the response (e.g. S/N, focal length and roughness) for arbitrary parameters setting. The genetic 
algorithm is then applied to obtain the optimal parameters settings. The major objectives in using 
the optimal design are to reduce the variation in the focal length and the surface roughness for a 
microlens array. This allows improved focus and enhanced illumination brightness. The results 
showed that microlens array quality could be significantly improved in comparison with the 
original design.

samples was improved compared with the conventional method.13 They showed that the a 
pressurized electrolyte in the electroforming process can increase the allowable applied current 
density and reduce the metallurgical grain size. These positive effects are beneficial to metallic 
microstructure fabrication using nickel electroforming in the LIGA process. 
Considering the deviations in design variables in the early design stages is a recent trend in 
quality engineering. Microlens array quality could be accomplished at low cost and high 
performance by reducing the variation. The variations due to the raw material, manufacturing 
process parameters and operation conditions would limit microlens array applications. This study 
introduced the parameter design concept which improves the quality of a microlens array whose 
manufacturing process involves significant variability. A systematic approach to achieving high 
quality gapless microlens array fabrication using the thermal reflow and caulking processes is 
developed. The two major objectives of this work are: 1) to minimize the performance variability 
in the focal lengths for the microlens array after the thermal reflow process; 2) to improve the 
surface roughness on the microlens array in the caulking process. These analyses will allow the 
microlens array to focus accurately on identical positions, enhancing the illumination brightness. 
2 Experiment structure and results 
The hexagonal layout pattern on the plastic mask is shown in figure 1. Silicon wafers are 
used as the substrate. The layout pattern is a design based on the aperture d = 70µm. The 
schematic representation of microlens array fabrication using thermal reflow and caulking 
processes is shown in figure 2. First, the photoresist is exposed through the plastic mask using a 
UV mask aligner (figure 2(a)). After developing, the column array on the silicon substrate could 
be defined (figure 2(b)). The column array is then heated to a temperature above the photoresist 
glass temperature. Surface tension transformed the melted columns into multiple half-spherical 
lenses with the same volume (figure 2(c)). Finally, the Ni electroforming process is applied to fill 
the gap between two adjacent half-spherical lenses, known as primary master mold (figure 2(d)). 
A gapless microlens array with a maximum 100% fill factor could be successfully produced by 
caulking process. A SEM photograph of a microlens array using the original design is shown in 
figure 3. Figure 4 shows the 3-D surface profile of a microlens array measured using NanoFocus 
µScan 3D laser profilometer. An atomic force microscope is used to measure the surface 
roughness of the mold insert. The S/N ratios and roughness of the original design are 25.0 and 
12.8 nm, respectively. The following two sections discuss how to improve the quality of 
microlens array in this study. 
2.1 Thermal reflow process 
In this work, the microstructure variations in the samples are observed and the optimal 
parameters combination is determined. We first identify the fabrication parameters which are 
sensitive in terms of affecting the focal length of the microlens array. According to our finding, 
the microlens focal length is dependent on the 1) spin coating revolution speed; 2) exposure 
time; 3) developing time; 4) thermal reflow temperature; 5) thermal reflow time. These 
fabrication parameters have the significant influence on the performance and variation of the 
design. The nonlinear effects of these factors at three factor levels are examined in this study. A 
L18 orthogonal array is used for these experiments. Table 1 shows each factor level selected for 
thermal reflow process. A 3-level factorial experiment design is used for the control factors. The 
original design is set as the central level. 
brightness appearance. The metal ion mass transportation is dominated by convection. Agitation 
(mixing) is required in the plating process to maintain optimum nickel deposit placement prevent 
anode/cathode polarization effects and improve coverage. 
The caulking time must be precisely controlled so that only the borders of two adjacent 
lenses make contact. Too much time causes a flattened lens sag profile. Too little time results in 
the lens border not reaching the neighbor lens, causing a gap between the two lenses. The 
thickness growth rate equation for electroforming layer is expressed as

thickness growth rate of deposition in µm/min and θ is the area current density deposition in 
mA/cm2. To easily calculate the growth rate, equation (1) can be written as 
0.0205V θ=  (2) 
where 0.0205 is the conversion constant. From geometry analysis in figure 6 the caulking time t

This work will concentrate on the relationship between the nickel electroforming surface 
property and electrolyte parameters. Electrolyte parameters such as pH-value, temperature, 
current density, the brightener content and wetting agent will be examined with respect to surface 
roughness. The primary function of nickel chloride is to improve anode corrosion and promote 
conductivity. The pH of the plating solution is an important control parameter, since it can affect 
the appearance, efficiency, and physical properties of the deposition. In general, higher pH values 
cause brittle deposits; lower pH values increase the pitting tendency and reduce the efficiency of 
the process. Each process has an optimum operating pH range. The pH range for plating solutions 
should be carefully controlled. Boric acid is an inexpensive pH buffer and tends to stabilize the 
pH in the cathode film of all nickel plating solutions. Wetting agents lower the surface tension of 
the plating solution to a range of 30 to 40 dynes/cm, reducing the tendency for hydrogen gas 
bubbles to remain on the surface of the part. These bubbles, eventually, will burst and produce a 
pit on the plated part. The brightener when added to a nickel electrolyte produces lustrous 
deposits with a high degree of reflectivity. Control factors and levels for the caulking process are 
listed as shown in table 4. 
An atomic force microscope was used to measure the surface roughness of the mold insert. 
The actual scanned area for each measurement point on the curved surfaces is 5 × 5 µm2. The 
roughness of the experiment results is shown in table 5. The effects plots of roughness on control 
factors for caulking process are shown in figure 7. It shows that a better surface is observed at the 
current density of 2ASD. It reveals that the nucleation rate is lower than the growth rate at lower 
current densities. A high deposition rate induces defects such as microtwin and microstrain. In 
addition, various pH values will also affect the surface roughness and figure 7 shows that less 
surface roughness is obtained at the middle level (pH value = 4). It also reveals that a smoother 
surface morphology can be produced at a temperature of 60°C. From figure 7, the optimal
