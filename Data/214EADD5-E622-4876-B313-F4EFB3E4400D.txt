Introduction 
 Granular filtration in the fixed bed is a time-dependent process in nature. During 
the course of filtration, the retention of deposited particles within the filter bed 
increases with filtration time until the breakthrough or the plug moment is achieved. 
As the deposition of particles in the filter increases, for a constant flow rate 
throughput, the structure of the filter media undergoes continuous change. This 
change, in turn, causes both the effluent particle concentration and the pressure drop 
across the filter bed vary with time. This dynamic behavior of granular filtration can 
be found by solving a set of phenomenological equations, and represented by a 
specific function describing the change of effluent concentration and of pressure 
gradient, respectively [1]. Those specific filtration functions were well reviewed in the 
chapters 2 and 3 of Prof. Tien Chi’s book [2]. 
In order to describe the effect of pore size distribution on the particle deposition 
behavior along the filter bed properly, the network model has been applied 
extensively to simulate the formation of porous media. A good review paper 
describing the continuum and discrete models of particle transport and gas reaction 
processes in disordered porous media was given by Sahimi et al. [3], at which the 
percolation theory and the statistical physics of disordered media were well described. 
In the network structure model, the topology of porous media can be defined by using 
 4 
individual particles with Brownian motion behavior as they move through the filter 
bed, by using the 2-D models of the modified square network and the triangular 
network, respectively. From which, the temporal variations of the permeability 
reduction and the pressure drop, either caused by the straining or by the direct 
deposition of particles on the pore walls, were determined. We found that the 
distribution of pore size has more profound effect on the reducing of the permeability 
ratio than that of the particle size distribution, especially at the initial period of 
filtration. But, we did not derive those specific functions from the breakthrough 
curves of effluent concentration and pressure drop obtained in those simulations. In 
order to amend this deficiency, the derivation of the specific filtration functions by 
using the same simulation method will be the main goal of the present paper. Three 
different 2-D network models of modified square, triangular and honeycomb will be 
adopted in the present simulations (see Fig. 1). The effects of two types of DLVO 
interaction energy curves [11] on the filter coefficients will also be investigated.  
Phenomenological Equations Describing Deep-Bed Filtration  
According to Tien and Payatakes [1], the phenomenological equations 
describing the dynamic behavior of deep bed filtration of a constant flow rate 
suspension can be summarized as follows,

where the subscript 0  denotes the initial filter state, and ),'(1 saF  and ),'(2 sbF  
are the specific functions to account for the deviation from the logarithmic law for the 
concentration profile and pressure drop, respectively. Usually, the specific filtration 
functions of ),'(1 saF  and ),'(2 sbF  can be determined from the breakthrough 
curves of effluent concentrations and pressure drop obtained by solving the above 
phenomenological equations numerically, and from those experimental filters by the 
optimization search technique. But, in order to take account of the Brownian motion 
behavior of those small particles considered in the present paper, we will use the 
Brownian dynamics simulation method and the network model to determine those two 
specific filtrations as follows. 
Network Model 
In the present study, we use three different 2-D network models, triangular, 
modified square and honeycomb, to represent the porous media structure of the filter 
(see Fig. 1), and adopt the Brownian dynamic simulation method to track the 
individual particles as they move through the network [8]. All pores in the network 
and particles in the influent are assumed to be with the Raleigh type size distribution 
[5]. Then, the pore size distribution can be assigned randomly to the bonds in the 
network as follows, 
 8 
the network, it has a choice of exit path. The exit path is selected randomly in the 
present model, but with a bias toward the paths with greater flow rates. Usually, the 
greater the flow rate, the greater the probability of the particle choosing that path. 
Details of this method can be found elsewhere [14]. 
In the current model, two different mechanisms of particle capture are considered: 
straining (size exclusion) and direct deposition. Straining occurs when the particle 
diameter is larger than the pore diameter selected for it to transport through the 
network. Straining plugs up the pore and drops its permeability to zero, and thereby 
changing the flow direction to other available pores. Direct deposition of a particle on 
a pore wall occurs as a result of hydrodynamic and DLVO interaction forces acting on 
the particle [15]. The details of this direct deposition mechanism in a constricted tube 
cell can be found in Chang et al. [16]. 
Constricted Tube Model 
 We represent the pore geometry in the present network by the constricted 
tube model [17]. As shown in Fig. 2, the sinusoidal geometric structure (SCT as 
sinusoidal constricted tube) used by Payatakes et al. [17] and Fedkiw and Newman 
[18] is considered for the constricted tube model in the present study. The expressions 
of the wall radius wr  corresponding to this SCT geometric structure with the radius 
varying from cr  ( cd /2) to maxr  ( maxd /2) is:  
 10 
and )(tA  represents the Brownian diffusion forces per unit mass of the particle 
caused by random collisions of the fluid molecules. 
  From those trajectories of influent particles in the network, the temporal 
variations of the pressure drop PD and the permeability reduction ratio 
0K
K in a 
filtration history can be determined [8, 16]. 
The Interaction Energy Curve of DLVO Theory 
    In the present paper, the effects of two types of interaction energy curves on the 
effluent concentration of particles, pressure drop and permeability ratio will be 
investigated for those three network models. In the DLVO theory [11], the total 
interaction energy between two approaching colloidal particles is the algebraic sum of 
the van der Waals and double- layer potentials as follows:

3. Simulation Results and Discussion 
 Simulations are performed on those two-dimensional networks shown in Fig. 1 
with the same initial permeability 0K = 0.39
2mm , and the influent velocity is kept at 
0.1 cm/sec. The number of bonds for the modified square network is 21070xN L = , 
for the triangular network is 21072xN L =  and for the honeycomb network is 
21073xN L = . The parameter values adopted in the simulation are: 0ie = 0.4, 
fr =10.0 mm , pmr = 0.5 mm  and inc = 1000 particles per 
3cm . Similar simulation 
procedure of tracking individual Brownian particles to move through the network 
described in our previous paper is adopted [8, 9].  
 Figs. 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c), respectively, shows the breakthrough curves of particles, 
the temporal variations of pressure drop and the permeability reduction when those 
three different network structures shown in Fig. 1 and two different types of 
interaction energy curves shown in Fig. 3 are considered. The existence of large 
primary energy barrier shown in curve A is unfavorable for the particles to deposit on 
the pore walls and therefore can transport more particles moving throughout the 
network, the value of 
in
out
c
c is always higher than that of curve B for all of those 
three network structures as shown in Fig. 4(a). Moreover, since more particles can

 The specific filtration func tion

lsa =F  of Eq. (7) can be determined 
from the effluent concentration history shown in Fig. 4(a) by calculating those 
integral area between the breakthrough curve of 
in

c
c and the curve of 
0.1=

c . Applying the same calculation method, the specific function 
),'(2 sbF of Eq. (8) for the pressure drop can be determined by using data shown in 
Fig. 4(b), too. The results are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. In Fig. 5(a), 
for all of the simulation cases considered in the present paper, we can find that 
),'(1 saF  decreases with the increase of the specific deposit s  until some 
maximum values of s max  are reached, beyond which ),'(1 saF  becomes zero and 
the filter can not perform its filtration function any more. The corresponding results 
on pressure drop increase are shown in Fig. 5(b). The data shown in this figure are in 
the form of 12 -F  vs. s . For the same network structure, since the “barrierless” 
interaction energy curve B is favorable for those particles to deposit on the pore walls, 
hence its corresponded specific deposit s  is higher than that of curve A at the same 
filter functions ),'(1 saF  and ),'(2 sbF  as shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), 
respectively. When comparing the effect of those three different network structures 
shown in Fig.1 with the same interaction energy curve, since the honeycomb network 
can filter those particles through the easiest way because of its lowest coordination

When

r  of a bond is smaller than 3.0 pmr , this bond is then assumed to be blocked 
by the captured particles in the present study [8, 9]. Eventually, the continuous 
decrease of the tube radius will let the first half of the constricted tube become a 
cylindrical tube which is less retentive to the incoming particles. This change in tube 
geometry resulting from the particle deposition can be applied to explain the 
decreasing tendency of ),'(1 saF  observed in Fig. 5(a).  
Conclusion 
  By applying the Brownian dynamics simulation method to track individual 
Brownian particles movement through the filter bed, the dynamic behavior of granular 
filtration is investigated. The histories of the particle effluent concentration and the 
pressure drop constitute the twin features of the dynamic behavior of granular 
filtration, and the expressions for those two specific filtration functions of ),'(1 saF  
and ),'(2 sbF are determined for three different network structures with the same 
initial permeability. The effects of two different types of DLVO interaction energy 
curves are also studied. Because those particles deposit on filter grains are assumed to 
form relatively smooth layers, the expressions obtained for the three network 
structures are presented in the form of decreases in collection efficiency and of

The Deposition Morphology of Brownian/non-Brownian particles within 
a Constricted Tube 
You-Im Chang*  
Department of Chemical Engineering, Tunghai University, Taichung, 40704, Taiwan, 
R.O.C. 
Abstract 
The deposition morphology of Brownian/non-Brownian particles within a 
constricted tube is investigated by applying the Brownian dynamics simulation 
method in the present paper. Two different geometric structures, the parabolic 
constricted tube (PCT) and the sinusoidal constricted tube (SCT), are adopted. The 
effect of various types of the total interaction energy curves of DLVO theory, and of 
the shadow area cast by those deposited particles, on the particles' collection 
efficiencies are also examined. For the PCT structure, under the same interaction 
energy curve, it is found that the non-Brownian particles always own a higher 
collection efficiency than that of the Brownian particles. Since the deposition location 
moves closer to the constriction part of the tube, the collection efficiencies of the 
Brownian/non-Brownian particles increase with the decrease of flow velocity. The 
SCT behaves differently, it is found that the collection efficiencies of non-Brownian 
particles are only slightly higher than those of Brownian particles when SCT is 
adopted. The steep slope of the tube wall near the constriction part of SCT dominates 
the whole deposition process of Brownian/non-Brownian particles. In comparison 
with the available experimental data, it is found that the present method can give a 
good simulation result.

attractive forces and the electrostatic repulsion forces of the DLVO theory [7]. 
In our previous paper [8], with the consideration of those hydrodynamic 
retardation factors, we had successfully investigated the deposition morphology and 
the corresponded collection efficiency of hydrosols onto a spherical collector by using 
the same Brownian dynamics simulation method developed by Ramarao et al. [4]. 
With the addition of the Brownian diffusion force in the force balanced equation 
describing the particle's trajectory, the effect of various types of the total interaction 
energy curves of DLVO theory, and of the shadow area cast by those deposited 
particles, on the particles' collection efficiencies were examined in this paper. 
Comparing with the case without considering the Brownian diffusion force in the 
trajectory equation, our simulation results showed that the collection efficiency is 
always higher when the particle's Brownian motion behavior is taken into 
consideration. As the deposition location moves closer to the front stagna tion point of 
the spherical collector, the dendrites formed for the case of considering the Brownian 
behavior of particles also contain more particles. 
In the present paper, instead of using a spherical collector, the deposition 
morphology of Brownian/non-Brownian particles within a constricted tube will be 
investigated by using the same simulation procedure established by Wang et al. [1] 
and Beizaie et al. [2]. Two different geometric structures, namely the parabolic 
constricted tube (PCT) and the sinusoidal constricted tube (SCT), will be adopted. In 
these simulations, the effects of the flow velocity and of the various shapes of the total 
interaction energy curves of DLVO theory are also considered. Distinguished 
deposition morphology is found between those particles with and without considering 
the Brownian diffusion behavior.

The difference between those two geometric structures is that the tube wall of PCT 
exhibits the highest slope at the entrance and the lowest slope at the constriction part 
of the tube, and vice versa for SCT. In the present study, the flow field equations 
established by Chow and Soda [18] and modified by Chiang and Tien [19] are 
adopted, which is briefly described as follows.

3. Brownian Dynamics Simulation 
 Similar to the previous papers of Ramarao et al. [4] and Chang et al.  [8], the 
principle of trajectory analysis and the method of Brownian dynamics simulation are 
adopted in the present study to simulate the direct deposition mechanism of particles. 
Unlike the case of the isolated spherical collector as described in our previous paper 
[8], the control window at the inlet cross-sectional area of the constricted tube is 
shown in Fig. 1. In the simulation of the present paper, we assume that the distribution 
of the initial position (r in , inq ) of each particle is assigned by the random number 
generator within the inlet control window. Note that the inlet positions of particles are 
located at 00 rrin <<  and pq 20 << in , at which 0r  is the radial distance beyond 
which no particle can be placed at the tube inlet (or control window), and 0r  can be 
found to be

With consideration of the inertia term in the force balance equation and of the 
specification of the flow fluid within the tube, the particle trajectory can be 
determined by integrating the Langevin equation as shown below.  
4. The Langevin trajectory equation 
In the present paper, if the gravity force is ignored, the Langevin trajectory 
5.3 of ref. [3], and ( )A t  represents a Gaussian white noise process in stochastic 
terms [4, 8].  In Eq. (21), 2V  is the normal coordinate of the particle center, and B  
and C  are the polynomial coefficients to represent the tangential component of the 
un-disturbed flow field uq  in the proximity of the collector surface, 
                       22 2u B Cq V V= +     (22) 
where the values of B  and C  are dependent on the geometry of the collector, and 
their evaluation method can be found in chapter 5.8 of ref. [3]. 
By substituting dr dt  for p rv , then the trajectory equation describing the ith 
particle path in the normal direction can be expressed as

Once the initial position of the ith particle pir  originated in the control window is 
known, its trajectory can be determined based on the above equations. When the 
separation distance between the particle and the collector surface (or the previous 
deposited particle) is smaller than the radius of this ith particle, then we assume that 
this ith particle is deposited in the present paper.

NE1=50.0 and NDL=5.02 for curve B, NE1=77.0 and NDL=10.0 for curve C, NE1=0.0 
and NDL=0.0 for curve D, and NE2=1.0 and NL0 =7.0 for all four curves. 
Corresponding to these four types of interaction energy curves with the defined values 
of NE1,  NE2, NL0 and NDL, the simulation results of the collection efficiency h  and 
the deposition morphology of particles will be given below. 
4. The Shadow effect 
The shadow effect arises from the fact that once a particle of finite size is 
deposited on the tube wall, as illustrated by the arc "' BBB  shown in Fig. 1, it creates 
a shadow area around itself within which no subsequent particle deposition can take 
place. The creation of a shadow area by deposited particles has two consequences [1]. 
First, because there is no deposition occurring in the shadow area, a discrete site 
deposition will result along the tube wall. If the shadow areas occupy most surface 
area of the tube wall, then those deposited particles can't be in the form of a smooth 
and uniform coating. Secondary, instead of depositing within the shadow area, those 
subsequent approaching particles now would attach themselves to the deposited 
particles. This behavior results in the formation of chainlike dendrites as observed in 
the experimental work of Payatakes et al. [21]. The dendritic growth of those 
deposited particles indicates that the morphology of particle deposits changes 
continuously during filtration. 
The magnitude of the shadow area is a function of the location of the deposited 
particle and other parameters shown in the above trajectory equations. The 
calculations made by Wang et al. [1] for Stokes flow around a spherical collector 
indicated that the magnitude of the shadow area is strongly dependent on the position 
of the deposition, the Stokes number and the relative size ratio RN  between the 
particle and the collector. The shadow area is shown to increase as the position of 
 
dM
dm
=h                              (30) 
In the present paper, the relationship between m  and M  will be investigated in 
order to obtain information on the increase of collection efficiency as a function of the 
extent of particle deposition. 
4. Numerical Simulation and Results 
The estimation of the collection efficiency from the trajectory equations based on 
the above stochastic simulation procedures for those four interaction energy curves 
shown in Fig. 2 are given below. The corresponding simulation parameters are 
presented in Table 1. The cases of considering and without considering the Brownian 
motion behavior of particles will be investigated as follows. 
 For inU =0.2 cm/sec, the simulation results of m  vs. M are shown in Fig. 3, 
which indicate that the number of particles collected increases with the increase of 
M  for all of those four interaction energy curves shown in Fig. 2 regardless whether 
the Brownian motion behavior of particles is considered or not. The order of the 
magnitude is curve D > curve C > curve B > curve A. Since there is no energy barrier 
existed in case D, the number of particles collected for curve D is always greater than 
that of the three other interaction energy curves. Comparing curve A with curves B 
and C, even with the presence of the deep secondary minimum which will give rise to 
an accumulation of particles, the steepest slope between the secondary minimum and 
the primary maximum energy barrier of curve A is still the main reason why it has the 
lowest m  value among these three curves. Because of a greater deposition 
probability caused by the normal convective force acting on those particles 
accumulated at the secondary minimum, the m  value of curve C is higher than that 
of curve B. In addition, since those particles without considering the Brownian 
diffusion forces own smaller ability to overcome the energy barrier shown in Fig. 2, 
region of the tube than the non-Brownian particles. On the other side, because of their 
greater opportunity to form the multi- layer dendrites at the constriction part of the 
tube, hence those non-Brownian particles always own higher collection efficiencies 
than Brownian particles as observed in Fig. 3. When those dendrites once formed, as 
observed in Figs. 4(a)-(d), the joint of individual dendrites and therefore the final 
"plug" stage is easier achieved at the constricted part than that at the entrance region 
of the tube. 
 Corresponding to those deposition results obtained for Brownian particles shown 
in Figs. 5(a)-(d), the shadow area created by the first deposited particle at different 
positions on the tube wall are shown in Figs. 6(a)-(d). In these four figures, like the 
arc "' BBB shown in Fig. 1, the magnitudes of shadow area are expressed as the arc 
length along the tube wall. It can be found that the shadow area increases as the 
position of deposition moves away from the entrance region of the tube for all of 
those four interaction energy curves. A maximum is reached at the region of 
0006.00004.0 ££ X  (measured horizontally from the inlet along the X-axis as 
shown in Fig. 4), where 
maxX =0.0004 for curve A, maxX =0.00048 for curve B, 
maxX =0.0005 for curve C and maxX =0.0006 for curve D. Hence, the maxX  value of 
the "barrierless" curve D is the closest to the constriction part of the tube among those 
four interaction energy curves shown in Fig. 2. Also, likes the order of the collection 
efficiency h  summarized in Table 2, the order of the magnitude of the maximum 
shadow area is curve D > curve C > curve B > curve A. Similarly, the same variation 
tendency of the 
maxX  value and the order of the maximum shadow area are obtained 
in our simulations for those non-Brownian particles. 
respectively. Different with those results obtained by using PCT, it can be found that 
the h  values of non-Brownian particles are only slightly higher than those of 
Brownian particles when SCT is adopted. The h  values also increase slightly when 
the flow velocity is decreased from 
inU =0.2 cm/sec to inU =0.1 cm/sec. The typical 
sets of the deposition morphology of Brownian/non-Brownian particles for curves A 
and D within SCT at 
inU =0.1 cm/sec and inU =0.2 cm/sec are illustrated in Figs. 
10(a)-(d) and Figs. 11(a)-(d), respectively.  From those two demonstrated structures of 
PCT (see Figs. 4 or 5) and SCT (see Figs. 10 or 11), it can be found that the tube wall 
of PCT exhibits a higher slope at the entrance and a lower slope at the constriction 
part of the tube than that of SCT. Therefore, the flow fields corresponding to these 
two geometric structures are different. For example, for SCT, the streamlines at the 
entrance of the tube are parallel to the axial direction, and persist along that direction 
over a certain distance before they move toward the center of the tube. This puts 
particles in a more favorable collection situation to deposit at the constriction part of 
SCT than that of PCT, at which the streamlines at the entrance are parallel to the axis, 
but change their direction very quickly as they move into the cell center [23]. In the 
simulations of using SCT, in addition to those factors of the flow rate and the DLVO 
interaction energy curves, we found that the steep slope of the tube wall near the 
constriction part of the tube dominates the whole deposition process of 
Brownian/non-Brownian particles. By this fact, as illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11, the 
joint of individual dendrites and therefore the final "plug" stage becomes more 
pronounced in SCT.  
8. Comparison with available experimental data 
Because of its ability to describe the deposition process of Brownian particles in 
a detailed step-by-step manner, the present dynamic simulation method can determine 
through a 0.44 cm  height filter column composed of nearly uniform glass spheres 
(i.e. fd = 500 mm ) with an influent flow rate of 13.8 sec/cm . The typical 
comparison results of )1/()( 00 hhh --  vs. s  are shown in Fig. 12.  In this figure, 
the solid line and the dashed line stand for the simulation results obtained by using the 
present method when PCT and SCT are adopted, respectively. It can be found that the 
simulation results obtained by the present method of using either PCT or SCT are 
only slightly lower than the Pannu's data at 34 103103 -- ´££´ s .  
In the experiment of Walata et al. [24], all collection data were measured by 
passing aerosol suspensions (i.e. made from suspensions of polyvinyltoluene latex 
spheres with meanpd , = 2.02 mm and a density of 1.027 3
g
cm
) through a Plexiglas 
cylinder with 3.97 cm  ID and a height of 0.42 cm . Nitrogen gas with a velocity of 
14.225 sec/cm  was passed through the three nozzles of the atomizer to provide the 
spray of aerosol droplets. The typical comparison results of 0 0( ) /h h h-  vs. s  are 
shown in Fig. 13. Same as those results observed for the Pannu's data shown in Fig. 
12, the simulation results obtained by the present method of using either PCT or SCT 
are only slightly lower than the data of Walata et al. at 4 310 10s- -£ £ .  
Those comparison results shown in Figs. 12 and 13 demonstrated the potential 
utility of the stochastic simulation technique adopted in the present paper, although 
the simulation demanded extensive computation time. Those slightly discrepancies 
observed between theoretical and experimental results indicate the incompleteness of 
the present simulation techniques in studying deposition in granular media, because 
the force balance equation (i.e. Eq. (19)) for determining particle trajectories were 
based on a clean collector flow field even if the extent of deposition was significant 
(i.e. the growth of dendrites). Based on the modification of Faxen's law for describing 
the drag force of a single small particle attached to a large spherical collector [25], 
angle between the main flow and the line of centers of the particles. Hence, by 
applying the equations described above, the values of ,D iFD  for those deposition 
morphologies shown in Figs. 4-5 and Figs. 8-11 can be estimated. Such effort will be 
executed in the author's future work. 
 
8. Conclusion 
By applying the Brownian dynamics simulation method, the deposition 
morphologies of Brownian particles within the constricted tube of two different 
geometric structures, PCT and SCT, for various types of the DLVO interaction energy 
curves have been studied. Both the singular and random motion behavior of the 
approaching particles and the shadow effect of deposited particles are considered. 
Because of their ability to move closer to the constriction part of the tube, the 
collection efficiencies of non-Brownian particles are always greater than those of 
Brownian particles. For PCT, the collection efficiencies of Brownian/non-Brownian 
particles increase significantly when the flow velocity is decreased from inU =0.2 
cm/sec to inU =0.1 cm/sec. But for SCT, since the steep slope of the tube wall near 
the constriction part of the tube dominates the whole deposition process, the 
collection efficiencies of Brownian/non-Brownian particles only increase slightly with 
the decrease of the flow velocity. From those illustration figures of Figs. 4-5 and Figs. 
8-11, it can be found that the present simulation method can describe the morphology 
of the deposits within the constricted tube well.
