closely related to the hypergraph transversal problem, for which the best currently known 
algorithm runs in incremental quasi-polynomial time (see, e.g., [16] and [21]). 
 
The problem of minimizing a linear objective function subject to a consistent system of sup-T M  
equations was first investigated by Fang and Li [14] and later by Wu et al. [36] and Wu and Guu [37]. 
Following the idea of Fang and Li [14], the linear optimization problem subject to a system of sup-T L  
equations was discussed by Loetamonphong and Fang [25], Guu and Wu [20], and Ghodousian and Khorram 
[17]. Furthermore, this problem was investigated under various composite operations by Wu and Guu [37], 
Khorram and Ghodousian [22], Wu [35], and Abbasi Molai and Khorram [2]. Some other generalizations on 
this issue can be found in [18, 1]. When the problem of minimizing a nonlinear objective function is 
concerned, the situation could be very complicated. Lu and Fang [27] designed a genetic algorithm to solve 
nonlinear optimization problems subject to a system of sup-TM equations. Yang and Cao [38] considered a 
special subclass of the problems of this type where the objective functions are posynomials. Fuzzy relational 
equation constrained geometric programming was investigated by Yang and Cao [39], which is a 
generalization of the so-called latticized linear programming problem considered in [34]. The multi-objective 
optimization problem was discussed in [33, 24]. These papers considered solving the sup-T equation 
constrained optimization problem with a certain specific composition as well as the instances with up to a few 
rows and columns. When larger scale sup-T equation constrained optimization problems are tackled, a 
systematic method is need. Most recently, it was shown by Li and Fang [23] that the problem of minimizing 
an objective function subject to a system of fuzzy relational equations can be reduced in general to a 0 − 1 
mixed integer programming problem in polynomial time. If the objective function is linear, or more generally, 
separable and monotone in each of the variables, then it can be further reduced to a set covering problem. 
 
     The set covering problem (SCP) is known to be one of Karp’s 21 NP-complete problems and has been 
extensively studied. See, for instance, Balas and Padberg [4], Caprara et al. [10] and Golumbic and Hartman 
[18]. Many algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the exact solution of the problem (see [5], [6], 
[15], [9], and [3].) It is well known that the computational time is high for any exact algorithm. Hence, large 
set covering problems are usually solved by means of a greedy type heuristic. Classical greedy algorithms are 
very fast in practice, but typically do not provide high quality solutions, as reported in [5] and [3]. The most 
effective heuristic approaches to SCP are those based on Lagrangian relaxation with subgradient optimization, 
following the work by [5], and then the improvements by [7], [15], [3], and [32]. An alternative to Lagrangian 
relaxation is surrogate relaxation. Lorena and Lopes [26] proposed an effective heuristic approach based on 
continuous surrogate relaxation and subgradient optimization. The experimental results reported in [26] 
suggested that the use of surrogate instead of Lagrangian relaxation within subgradient optimization allows 
one to obtain near optimal multipliers in a shorter computing time. Beasley and Chu [8] proposed a genetic 
algorithm-based heuristic approach and the computational results in [8] showed that the genetic algorithm is 
capable of producing high-quality solutions for the set covering problems. 
 
    This work follows the idea of Li and Fang [23] and considers the resolution of the sup-T equation 
constrained optimization problem (OP-T). Taking the advantage of well developed techniques and clarity of 
exposition in the theory of integer programming, a set covering-based surrogate approach is proposed to solve

may assume that 0)0( jf  for every j ∈  N. By Theorem 2, for an arbitrary weight vector, solving the  
system of sup-T equations with a separable and monotone objective function in each of the variables can be 
decomposed into two subproblems, one of which can be solved analytically while another is not easy to 
handle. The subproblem with nonnegative weight vector is inevitably an NP-hard problem since the classical 
set covering problem can be regarded as a special scenario of this problem. On the other hand, this problem 
can be polynomially reduced to a set covering problem or a constrained set covering problem, where the 
existence of additional constraints depends on whether the involved continuous triangular norm is 
Archimedean or not.

According to above theorems, the problem of minimizing a separable and monotone objective function 
in each of the variables subject to a system of sup-T equations, with T being a continuous t-norm, can be 
polynomially reduced to a set covering problem. This reduction can be completed in a time complexity of 
O(mn) if the t-norm T is Archimedean, or in a time complexity of O(m 2 n) if it is non-Archimedean. 
 
The set covering problem is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and, therefore, 
difficult to solve, i.e., computational time is high for any exact algorithm. Hence, large set covering problems 
are usually solved by means of a greedy type heuristic for quickly find optimal or near optimal solutions. 
However, classical greedy algorithms typically do not provide high quality solutions, an effective heuristic 
approach based upon continuous surrogate relaxations and subgradient optimization has been proposed for 
solving set covering problems. The computational results in [26] show that the surrogate heuristic approach is 
faster and more stable than the well considered heuristic algorithms based on Lagrangian relaxations. In this 
work, a surrogate heuristic is applied to solve the sup-T equation constrained optimization problem in view of 
the associated set covering problem.  
 
3. Conclusions 
      This paper studies the optimal solutions to the sup-T equation constrained optimization problems, with 
T being a continuous triangular norm. Taking advantage of the well developed techniques and clarity of 
exposition in the theory of integer programming, a set covering-based surrogate approach is proposed to solve 
the sup-T equation constrained optimization problem with a separable and monotone objective function in 
each of the variables. Computational results show that the proposed method can efficiently solve the sup-T 
equation constrained optimization problems. In fact, the proposed method has been tested on most examples 
reported in the literature, and it finds the solutions at very early iterations. This validates the properties of 
faster convergence and less oscillation of the surrogate heuristic. With the aid of the initial reduction 
technique and the replacement heuristic in the implementation, the performance of the proposed method can 
be further improved. This study provides, for the first time, an opportunity to solve the large scale sup-T 
equation constrained optimization problems.

此次會議中，筆者所發表的論文是有關探討具 sup-T 模糊關係限制式之最佳化問題。筆者提出以
集合覆蓋(set covering)方法為基礎的替代(surrogate)求解法，來處理同時具可分離(separable)及單調
(monotone)性質之目標函數在 sup-T 模糊關係限制式下的最佳化求解問題。這個方法首次提出用整數規
劃的角度和技巧，解具模糊關係限制式之最佳化問題 。數值結果說明此方法不僅可有效解決所提之問
題更具備解大型 sup-T模糊關係限制式之最佳化問題的能力。此篇論文引發些許相關領域學者(如David 
Yang Gao, University of Ballarat, Australia)之熱烈討論，並提出此主題之對偶問題等相關議題等寶貴意
見。 
此外，此次的研討會，依筆者參加的心得，可歸納為下列幾方面: 
 
1. Estimation of Pure Characteristics Demand Models with Pricing 
A pure characteristics model (PCM) is a class of discrete-choice random-coefficients demand models 
in which there is no idiosyncratic logit error term in a consumer's utility. The absence of the logit error term 
leads to a nonsmooth formulation of the predicted market share equations. As a result, inverting the market 
share equations for the unobserved product characteristics and estimating the model by using the nested 
fixed-point approach becomes computationally intractable. Prof. Pang introduced lotteries for consumers' 
purchase decisions, which are then characterized by a system of complementarity constraints. This 
reformulation leads to smooth market share equations. As a result, the generalized method of moments (GMM) 
estimation of a pure characteristics model can be reformulated as a quadratic program with nonlinear 
complementarity constraints. The reformulation of consumers' decision problem provides a unified framework 
to study the Nash-Bertrand pricing problem under pure characteristics demand models and the GMM 
estimation of the demand model with pricing equations.  
 
2. A Note on Cvar and Risk Measures  
As a coherent risk measure, the conditional value at risk (CvaR for short) has received considerable 
attention in both theory (Risk measure, robust optimization) and practice (financial and logistic applications). 
Prof. Sun and Qiang consider this measure from its dual definition as the worst case expected value over a 
risk envelope. The minimization formula of CVaR for the cases of discrete and continuous base distribution, 
which cover all base distributions arising in known applications of CvaR is derived. They further consider the
