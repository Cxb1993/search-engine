delivery of DOTAP, DOTAP/Chol, and DOTAP/DOPE liposomes, 
but caused decreases in the cellular entry of DC-Chol/DOPE 
liposomes. An approximately linear correlation between the 
internalized plasmid and the transgene expression was observed for 
all the treatments in this study. When the vectors were administered 
to mouse by intravenous injection, a 10 fold and 3 fold increases in 
the luciferase expression of lung were observed for DOTAP 
liposomes containing 330 mM cellobiose and trehalose, 
respectively. This study showed that using trehalose and cellobiose 
with lipid-based delivery system provides a straightforward 
approach to effectively enhance both in vitro and in vivo transgene 
expression.  
Expression plasmid was formulated with various concentrations of 
trehalose to be injected into the skeletal muscles of C57BL/6 mice. 
The levels of trangene expression were indicated by the levels of 
luciferase expression or by the histological X-gal staining of beta-
galactosidase expression. Trehalose was also added into serum to 
examine the ability of protecting DNA from degradation. An 
optimal trehalose concentration, 10 mM, exists to achieve a high 
level of transgene expression which is 7 fold higher than that in the 
absence of trehalose. When compared with other disaccharides, only 
the incorporation of trehalose can effectively enhance the transgene 
expression. Trehalose is able to improve the transgene expression of 
intramuscular injection at a low gene dosage and to prolong the 
durations of transgene expression. Trehalose is an effective adjuvant 
for intramuscular administration of naked plasmid for both 
enhanced levels and prolonged durations of transgene expression.

I.1	Abstract	 	
Lipid-based vectors have been widely applied to in vivo and in vitro gene delivery. 
Disaccharides can effectively stabilize lipid membranes. This study examined whether 
disaccharides could enhance the transgene expression mediated by lipid-based vectors. 
Different disaccharides were incorporated into the vectors prepared with 
DOTAP/protamine/DNA (LPD) or with DNA/cationic liposomes containing DOTAP, 
DOTAP/Chol, DOTAP/DOPE, or DC-Chol/DOPE. The levels of transgene expression 
and internalized plasmid of CHO cells were represented by the percentages of GFP 
positive cells and the fluorescence intensity of ethidium-monoazide covalently labeled 
plasmid, respectively. The vectors containing either cellobiose or trehalose were also 
intravenously injected into mouse tail vein to investigate the potentials of in vivo 
applications. For enhancing the transgene expression, cellobiose was found to be 
effective for all the vectors whereas maltose decreased the effectiveness of 
DOTAP/Chol liposomes and LPD. For the internalization of plasmid, most 
disaccharides were able to increase the cellular delivery of DOTAP, DOTAP/Chol, 
and DOTAP/DOPE liposomes, but caused decreases in the cellular entry of 
DC-Chol/DOPE liposomes. An approximately linear correlation between the 
internalized plasmid and the transgene expression was observed for all the treatments 
in this study. When the vectors were administered to mouse by intravenous injection, 
a 10 fold and 3 fold increases in the luciferase expression of lung were observed for 
DOTAP liposomes containing 330 mM cellobiose and trehalose, respectively. This 
study showed that using trehalose and cellobiose with lipid-based delivery system 
provides a straightforward approach to effectively enhance both in vitro and in vivo 
transgene expression.  
8 
 
bromide (EtBr), and protease inhibitors were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 
Ethidium monoazide (EMA) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugen, OR). 
1,2-Dioleoyl-3-Trimethylammonium-Propane (DOTAP) and 
1,2-Dioleoyl-Phosphatidylethanoamine (DOPE) were from Avanti Lipids (Alabaster, 
AL). All chemicals were used as received without further purification. 
3-[N-(N',N'-Dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl] Cholesterol (DC-Chol) was 
synthesized according to the descriptions previously reported [8]. Water was 
deionized by a Milli-Q water purification system (Bedford, MA). The pEGFP-C1 and 
gWiz-luciferase plasmids were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and from Genlantis 
(San Diego, CA), respectively. Plasmid purification kits were purchased from Qiagen 
(Palo Alto, CA). The Steady-Glo luciferase assay system was from Promega 
(Madison, WI). Antibiotics of penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin and fetal bovine 
serum were obtained from Hyclone (Logan, Utah). 
I.3.2 Plamsid amplification and labeling  
Both pEGFP-C1 and gWiz-luciferase plasmids were, respectively, amplified in E. 
coli DH5, and then purified by using a Qiagen kit. The purified pEGFP-C1 plasmid 
was covalently labeled with EMA through a photoreaction as previously described 
[15].  
I.3.3 Preparation of liposomes 
A lipid mixture containing DOTAP (10 mg), DOTAP/Chol (10 mg/45 mg, molar 
ratio 55/45), DOTAP/DOPE (10 mg/4.5 mg, molar ratio 45/55), or DC-Chol/DOPE 
(7.7 mg/10.7 mg, molar ratio 50/50) were, respectively, dissolved in 20 ml chloroform. 
After the removal of chloroform from the lipid mixture by vaccum evaporation, the 
dried film was rehydrated with water at 4 oC overnight. The hydrated liposomes were 
then extruded through stacked polycarbonate filters of 1.0 m, 0.4 m, and 0.1 m 
sequentially. The hydrodynamic size of extruded liposomes was confirmed by 
dynamic light scattering. 
I.3.4 Preparation of transfection reagent  
The DMEM/disaccharide buffer was prepared by mixing DMEM and one of the 
following disaccharides: cellobiose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose. In order 
to maintain the molality of transfection reagents around 320 – 360 mM, which was 
almost equivalent to the physiological molality, DMEM and each disaccharide stock 
solution of 375 mM were mixed at volumetric ratios of 1/4, 2/3, 3/2, and 4/1, to make 
75, 150, 225, 300 mM disaccharide, respectively. DNA-lipid or LPD complex was 
prepared by mixing 100 l of 2 g plasmid with 100 l of the desired liposomes in 
DMEM at a liposome/DNA charge ratio of 3, or by mixing the plasmid with a 
10 
 
injection. The organs were collected and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer 
containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors in 200 mM 
Tris-HCl (pH = 7.8) by a homogenizer (PolyTron PT2100, Littau-Lucerne, 
Switzerland) at 26,000 rpm for two cycles of 10 sec on and 10 sec off. After 
centrifugation at 10,000 g, 4 oC for 10 min, an aliquot of 50 l of the lysate 
supernatant was analyzed for the luciferase activity using a Steady-Glo luciferase 
system, and the luminescence intensity was measured using a luminometer (Turner 
Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). The protein content of the same lysate supernatant was 
quantitated using Bradford's method [16]. The expression levels of luciferase were 
represented by relative light units per mg of the lysate proteins.      
I.3.9 Statistical analysis 
Dunnett’s one-way ANOVA method was used to compare the samples which 
received disaccharide treatments and those in the absence of any disaccharides. 
Statistical significance was indicated by a p value less than 0.05.  
I.4	Results	and	Discussion	
I.4.1 Effects of disaccharides on the levels of transgene expression mediated by 
different lipid-based systems 
When DOTAP was the carrier to form lipoplex with DNA for gene delivery, the 
incorporation of a disaccharide into the transfection reagent was found to affect the 
GFP positive percentages of the transfected CHO cells (Figure 1). The changes in 
transfection efficiency depended on the disaccharide type and the disaccharide 
concentration in the transfection reagent. Cellobiose, lactose, sucrose, and trehalose 
were able to promote the transfection efficiency in an optimal concentration range. 
The efficiency was enhanced from 28% to above 40% at 180 mM lactose, sucrose, or 
trehalose, and was almost doubled at 120 mM cellobiose. Maltose, however, had a 
negative effect on the transgene expression, and high maltose concentrations 
produced less GFP positive cells. At a concentration of 240 mM maltose, a severe 
decrease in transfection efficiency from 28% to 9% was observed.  
We further investigated whether the disaccharides would also alter the transgene 
expression mediated by the liposomes containing different lipid compositions. The 
transfection reagent contained a final concentration of 120 mM disaccharide. The 
effects of colipids were examined by mixing DOTAP with cholesterol and DOPE, 
respectively, to form the liposomes of DOTAP/Chol and DOTAP/DOPE whereas the 
effects of cationic lipid structures were compared by using the liposomes of 
DOTAP/DOPE and DC-Chol/DOPE. The synergistic effects of disaccharides with 
protamine sulfate, an enhancer in lipid-based gene delivery, were studied using LPD 
12 
 
disaccharides, the intracellular amounts of plasmid delivered by the liposomes 
containing DOPE was less than those delivered by other liposomes (Fig. 3A), 
presumably due to vector destabilization caused by salts of DMEM. The presence of 
disaccharides showed opposite effects on the cellular entries of plasmid delivered by 
DC-Chol/DOPE liposomes and DOTAP-based liposomes, such as DOTAP/DOPE. 
The disaccharides enhanced the delivery of DOTAP/DOPE by 37% to nearly 70% of 
the amount in DMEM, but decreased the delivery of DC-Chol/DOPE by 44% to 78% 
(Figure 3B). On the other hand, the disaccharides had very minimal effects on the 
delivery for LPD except maltose which reduced the plasmid delivery of LPD.  
Most of the disaccharides have been shown to be effective stabilizers for cell 
membranes and liposomes, and therefore might cause the increases in the cellular 
entry of plasmid by stabilizing the liposomes containing DOTAP. As for 
DC-Chol/DOPE liposomes, the disaccharides might not be effective enough to 
stabilize the vector.  
I.4.3 Correlation between the levels of transgene expression and the amounts of 
internalized plasmid  
A quantitative relationship between the intracellular plasmid and the transfection 
efficiency was established by correlating the levels of EMA labeled plasmid with the 
percentages of GFP positive cells as shown in Figure 4. An approximately linear 
dependence was observed between the intracellular plasmid and the transfection 
efficiency. For most of the treatments, the percentage of GFP positive cells followed a 
trend increasing linearly with the intracellular plasmid. The linear dependence could 
be used to compare the utilization of plasmid delivered under different conditions of 
treatments. The plasmid was utilized more efficiently for the treatments under the 
linear dependence line than those above the linear dependence because the former 
produced higher GFP positive percentages at lower levels of intracellular plasmid. 
Specifically, the plasmid delivered by DOTAP in DMEM/trehalose was almost the 
least efficiently utilized whereas those delivered by DOTAP and DOTAP/Chol in 
DMEM/cellobiose and those delivered by DC-Chol/DOPE in the presence of all 
disaccharides were more efficiently utilized. These evidences implied that the 
disaccharides increased the transfection efficiency by at least two different 
mechanisms. One way might be to increase the amounts of intracellular plasmid 
which might result from the stabilizing effects of disaccharides on the lipid-based 
vectors because most disaccharides have been shown to very effective in stabilizing 
cell membrane and liposomes. Another way might be through the alterations in 
intracellular processing to facilitate the intracellular endosomal release of plasmid 
from lipid-based vectors.  
14 
 
showing low stability. But when DMEM/disaccharide buffers were used to replace 
DMEM, most of the relative changes became less than those in DMEM alone (Fig. 
6B). The observations indicated that the presence of disaccharides indeed improved 
vector stability, and supported that the improved stability by disaccharide attributed to 
the enhanced cellular uptake of the vectors as well as the enhanced levels of transgene 
expression. 
I.4.6 Applications of disaccharides to intravenous administration 
Because cellobiose was found to be the only disaccharide that was an effective 
enhancer for all the lipid compositions examined in this study, and trehalose has been 
shown to be the only effective enhancer for polyethylenimine, both cellobiose and 
trehalose were, respectively, incorporated into the reagents containing DOTAP 
liposomes, DOTAP/Chol liposomes, and LPD for intravenous injection through 
mouse tail vein. The results showed that mouse lung still appeared to be the organ 
with the highest level of transgene expression as compared to other organs for each 
different treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the incorporation of 
disaccharides did not change the pattern of in vivo transgene expression mediated by 
liposomal vectors. Namely, the entrapment of vectors within lung was still the major 
factor which influenced the transgene expression after i.v. administration. For DOTAP 
liposomes, both cellobiose and trehalose could increase the transgene expression of 
lung, and the enhancements strongly depended on the disaccharide concentrations 
(Fig. 7A). At 180 mM the enhancements became significantly noticeable. As the 
concentration increased to 330 mM, which is almost identical to the molality of body 
fluid, cellobiose could improve the luciferase expression of lung by more than 10 fold 
to a level which was almost equivalent to those of DOTAP/Chol (Fig. 7B). The 
enhancing effects of cellobiose and trehalose were further inspected for DOTAP/Chol 
liposomes and LPD combined with 330 mM cellobiose or trehlose. Cellobiose and 
trehalose were found to result in slight increases in the lucifierase activities of LPD 
and DOTAP/Chol by about 2-3 fold (Fig. 7B). In the absence of disaccharides, using 
cholesterol as a colipid has been shown to increase the transgene expression of mouse 
lung after i.v. injection mainly due to the stabilization of the aggregates of lipidic 
vectors in the lung. Cellobiose and trehalose might behave in a similar way to 
enhance the luciferase activity by increasing the stability, and such an effect became 
more pronounced when the disaccharides were used with DOTAP liposomes which 
had been shown to form less stable aggregates in the lung. However, a cellular 
mechanism which the disaccharides were involved with intracellular processing of the 
internalized plasmid might exist as well for in vivo transgene expression. Using the 
disaccharides in i.v. injection presented very little safety concern as evidenced by a 
previous study which has shown very minimal acute cytotoxicity after intravenous

Part II  
Using Trehalose as Adjuvant for Transgene Expression Delivered by 
Intramuscular Injection of Plasmid DNA  
 
 
 32 
 
have been shown to be effective enhancers for muscular injection of naked plasmid by 
retarding plasmid degradation in muscles. Some myofiber regenerating compounds, 
such as cardiotoxin and bupivacaine [14, 15], could also result in higher expression 
levels when the treated muscles got recovered.  
Recently trehalose has been shown to be able to improve the levels of transgene 
expression mediated both by the lipid-based gene delivery system [16] and by 
DNA-polyethylenimine complexes [17]. In this study, we examined whether the 
incorporation of trehalose into a naked plasmid solution could improve the transgene 
expression by muscular injection. Luciferase and -galatosidase expressions were 
used to provide a quantitative and a histological comparison, respectively. The dose 
response and durations of the trangene expression were also examined.  
II.3	Materials	and	Methods	
II.3.1 Chemicals 
Cellobiose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose were from Fluka Chemie 
(Buchs, Switzerland). Chitosan dimer and laminaribiose were obtained from 
Seikagaku (Chuo-ku, Japan ). Protease inhibitors, X-gal, and glucose were purchased 
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). All chemicals were used as received without further 
purification. Water was deionized by a Milli-Q water purification system (Bedford, 
MA). The gWiz-luciferase plasmid was from Genlantis (San Diego, CA). The 
Steady-Glo luciferase assay system and pCMV-β-Gal plasmid were from Promega 
(Madison, WI). Plasmid purification kits were purchased from Qiagen. Antibiotics of 
penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin and fetal bovine serum were obtained from 
Hyclone (Logan, Utah). 
II.3.2 Plasmid preparation 
The plasmids were amplified in E. coli DH5, and purified by a Qiagen plasmid 
purification kit according to the manufacture’s instructions. 
II.3.3 Intramuscular injection 
C57BL/6 female mice of 6-8 weeks were obtained from the National Animal 
Center (Taiwan).The mice were housed and sacrificed according to the guidelines of 
the National Taiwan Ocean University. The mice were anesthetized with 0.015 ml of 
2% Avertin solution per gram body weight before the injection of DNA into the 
quadriceps muscle of each mouse. The injection volume was kept at 50 μl, and 
contained 5.2% glucose and various amounts (5 to 50 g) of plasmid plus one of the 
following sugars: cellobiose, lactose, maltose, sucrose, trehalose, chitosan dimer, and 
laminaribiose.

mouse muscles were collected. The transgene expression of luciferase was assayed 
and expressed as relative light units per milligrams of protein (RLU/mg protein). It 
was noted that an optimal concentration of trehalose, 10 mM, existed to achieve a 
high transgene expression of luciferase activity, which was 7 fold higher than that in 
the absence of trehalose (Fig 1). Interestingly, when the trehalose concentration was at 
12.5 mM, a somewhat slight enhancement in the transgene expression was observed 
whereas the levels of transgene expression were rapidly restored to that in the absence 
of trehalose when the trehalose concentrations were at 15 and 20 mM. The results 
suggested that the transgene expression was very sensitive to the trehalose 
concentration in the injection. The effective range of trehalose might be caused by 
two different mechanisms of trehalose on the cellular functions. The lipids containing 
trehalose moiety has been shown to prevent the fusion between lysosomes and 
endosomes [19, 20], thus allowing more available plasmid for the transgene 
expression after the plasmid entered the muscular cells via injection. On the other 
hand, trehalose is also known as an effective stabilizer for the cellular memebranes 
[21, 22], and might prevent the cellular entry of plasmid. Therefore, an optimal range 
of trehalose existed to achieve a high level of transgene expression when those two 
opposite factors are counterbalanced. 
II.4.2 Effects of trehalose on the gene dosages  
In order to examine the effects of trehalose on the applied gene dosages, the 
optimal trehalose concentration, 10 mM, was incorporated into different amounts of 
plasmid for injection. The luciferase expression of each muscle was analyzed 7 days 
post injection (Fig. 2). The addition of trehalose was noticed to improve the levels of 
luciferase expression at different gene dosages. In the presence of trehalose, a low 
dosage of 5 g plasmid could achieve a transgene expression level which is 25% of 
that in the absence of trehalsoe and at a dosage as high as 50 g. When the dosage 
was increased to 15 g and injected with trehalose, the resulting luciferase activity 
was the same as that at a high dosage of 50 g in the absence of trehalsoe. However, a 
further increase in the dosage to 50 g did not show any improvements in the 
luciferase expression. The trehalose in intramuscular injection presented a dosage 
response similar to that in the absence of trehalsoe presumably because trehalose 
hardly altered the cellular mechanisms for transgene expression. The use of trehalose 
enabled the transgene expression to reach a plateau at a dosage as low as of 15 g 
possibly by allowing more accessible plasmid for expression through the retardation 
of plasmid degradation in the muscles.  
II.4.3 Histological assays of transgene expression in muscles 
In order to assess the pattern of transgene expression, the luciferase plasmid was 
 36 
 
degradation by nuclease in the muscle.  
II.4.6 Effects of trehalose on the durations of transgene expression 
In an effort to assess the effects of trehlose on the durations of transgene 
expression, a dose of 15 g plasmid was administered intramuscularly. The luciferase 
activity, which was assayed at different time intervals after injection, exhibited similar 
patterns in the absence and in the presence of 10 mM trehalose (Fig. 6), suggesting 
that trehalose did not affect the primary mechanisms of trangene expression mediated 
by intramuscular injection of naked plasmid. The existence of trehalose, however, 
resulted in higher levels of luciferase activity at different time intervals except at day 
3 when a very minimal level of expression was detected. The highest level of 
expression was observed at day 7 with a 7 fold increase when trehalose was used. 
Afterwards, the presence of trehalose could prolong the levels of expression from day 
14 up to day 30 without any significant decreases while the levels of expression 
gradually decreased with time in the absence of trehalose. The prolonged transgene 
expression might be also attributed to the inhibition of nuclease which allowed more 
intact plasmid remaining in the muscles for expression even 30 days post injection. 
Using trehalose presented very little safety concern as evidenced by a previous 
study which has shown very minimal acute cytotoxicity after intravenous injection of 
1000 mg trehalose/kg body weight into mice, rats, and pigs [26]. The concentration of 
10 mM in an injection volume of 50 μl is equivalent to 6.8 mg trehalose/kg body 
weight for a mouse typically of around 25g, and is lower than other trehalose 
concentrations which have been employed in a clinical trial of dry eye syndrome [27] 
and proposed to prevent the Huntington disease [28, 29]. Such a low concentration 
might avoid the damages to the muscles compared with other reagents [14, 15, 30]. 
Additionally, the low dosage of plasmid for high and sustained levels of transgene 
expression might minimize the potential immune responses elicited by the CpG 
motifs on plasmid of high and repeated dosages [23, 31, 32], and can allow injection 
to multiple sites for those treatments requiring a further enhanced levels of transgene 
expression without too much safety concern. 
II.5	Conclusions	
In this study, we observed that trehalose could enhance the levels of transgene 
expression by 7 fold and prolong the durations of transgene expression up to 30 days 
after muscular injection of naked plasmid. When other sugars were used to replace 
trehalose, the enhancement became insignificant. The actual mechanism of trehlaose 
still remains unclear, but is presumably attributed to the -1,1glucosidic linkage that 
does not exist in other sugars.

Figure II. 1 Effects of trehalose concentrations on the levels of transgene expression. 
An aliquot of 50 μl solution containing 5.2% glucose, 15 g gWiz-luciferase plasmid 
and trehalose was injected into the skeletal muscles of C57BL/6 female mice. After 7 
days, the transgene expression of the muscle was assayed, and the results showed that 
10 mM trehalose can effectively enhance the levels of transgene expression. The 
asterisk indicates a significant difference p<0.05.
