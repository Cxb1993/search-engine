Abstract
This project aims to reduce the sensing redundancy and maintain sufficient sensing coverage and network con-
nectivity in sensor networks. An efficient principled approach is developed for organizing an ad-hoc sensor network
into clusters with directional antennas. With directional antennas, random waiting timers, and local criterions, cluster
performance may be substantially improved and sensing redundancy and communication interference can be drastically
suppressed. This project evaluates the merits and trade-offs of the different available techniques towards developing
more efficient and practical algorithms to achieve connected coverage and provide efficient network topology man-
agement.
I. INTRODUCTION
Unlike wireless cellular systems with a robust infrastructure, sensors in an ad hoc network may be deployed
without infrastructure, which requires them to be able to self-organize. Such sensor networks are self-configuring
distributed systems and, for reliability, should also operate without centralized control. In addition, because of hardware
restrictions such as limited power, direct transmission may not be established across the complete network. In order to
share information between sensors which cannot communicate directly, communication may occur via intermediaries
in a multi-hop fashion. Scalability and the need to conserve energy lead to the idea of organizing the sensors
hierarchically, which can be accomplished by gathering collections of sensors into clusters. Clustering sensors is
advantageous because it improves energy efficiency, aggregates information from individual sensors, abstracts the
characteristics of network topology, and provides scalability and robustness for the network.
With sensors placed close to an event, wireless sensor networks can observe the phenomenon and receive data.
However, having too few active sensors or excessive ones may result in reduced sensing coverage or severe interfer-
ence, which will have a great influence on network performance features such as energy and bandwidth efficiency,
and sensing quality. Hence, reducing the sensing redundancy and maintaining sufficient sensing coverage and network
connectivity are critical requirements in sensor networks [1],[2]. In addition, the two issues of energy constraint and
communication interference have to be considered together with both the network connectivity and data collection.
Recently there has been great interest in using directional antennas on sensor nodes to improve the general performance
of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [3]-[6]. Compared with the traditional disc communication model, directional
antennas may actually promote communication quality by focusing transmission energy in one direction and reducing
interference and fading [8].
it is a primary sensing sector; this also serves to notify its neighboring sectors that they are complemental sensing
sectors.
Accordingly, the distributions of these two kinds of sensing sectors are determined. The purpose of this phase is
to reduce the sensing redundancy in the dense sensing field. Figure 1 shows an example of determining the primary
and complemental sensing sectors, which may serve as a basis for sensor scheduling management. Observe that the
sensing coverage with omnidirectional antennas (Figure 1 (top left)) and that of the primary sensing sectors (Figure
1 (top right)) are nearly the same.

B. Phase II: Choosing the Clusterheads and Intra-Cluster Communication Sectors
When completing the operation of Phase I, each sensor initiates a cluster waiting timer (CWT) for being a
clusterhead. Note that in Phase I, random SWTs are used to decide the primary sensing sectors. In Phase II, each
sensor sets a random CWT and update the timer based on the total number of message receptions in its sectors during
the operation in Phase I. The sensors that hear many neighbors are good candidates for initiating new clusters; those
with few neighbors should choose to wait. The updating formula for the random CWT of sensor i yields
WT
(CH)
i = α
NT ·WT (CH,0)i , α > 1, (2)
whereWT (CH,0)i is the initial CWT of sensor i for being a clusterhead,NT is the number of neighboring complemental
sensing sectors. The rationale for the setting of parameter α is that a sensor with a higher number of transmissions
in Phase I will make a higher portion of neighboring sectors become complemental sensing sectors, which may not
make the sensor a good clusterhead candidate.
If both of the following conditions apply, then sensor i declares itself a clusterhead:
• The random CWT expires. That is, WT (CH)i = 0.
• None of the neighboring sensors are already members of a cluster.
If sensor i satisfies the above conditions, its each complemental sensing sector rotationally broadcasts a message
proclaiming that it is beginning a new cluster; this also serves to notify its neighbors that they are assigned to join
the new cluster with ID i. Denote a sector of a sensor which performs intra-cluster communication as a communication
sector. When a sensor joins the cluster, it sends an updated Hello message, becomes a one-hop cluster member, stops
its timer, and selects its corresponding communication sector. On the other hand, when WT (CH)i = 0 and some of
3
3 expires, sensor 3 may select the earliest broadcasting gateway candidate (e.g. sensor 8) to establish a pair of
distributed gateways for cluster 4 and cluster 16. Accordingly, the results of Phase III processing are that each cluster
i assigns a single member to communicate with each nearby cluster j and the waiting timers help to ensure that
the chosen member is one of the appropriate members for inter-cluster communication even though the topology of
the system is unknown. By following the operation of choosing communication sectors in Phase II, the inter-cluster
communication sectors can be determined. If the clusters are too far apart (outside the communication range R), no
gateway sensors will be assigned. Readers are referred to the virtual flowchart in [9] for the complete procedure of
the gateway selection phase.

Fig. 3. The communication sectors of gateways (top); an example of gateway selection (bottom).
Once the communication sectors are selected, each sensor should update its communication responsibility in its
each sector. That is, each sensor will only perform communication in its communication sector(s). Thus, considering
both the sensing and communication responsibility in each sector, there are four different kinds of sectors: (1) the
sector has both primary sensing and communication responsibility (2) the sector has primary sensing responsibility
(3) the sector has both complemental sensing and communication responsibility (4) the sector has complemental
sensing responsibility. An example of sector classification is shown in Figure 4. Referring to Figure 4, sensor 2 has
one sector with primary sensing and communication responsibility, one sector with primary sensing responsibility,
and one complemental sensing sector. Based on the sensing responsibility, we further denote a sensor node with
only complemental sensing sectors as a complemental node. Otherwise, a sensor node is regraded as a primary node.
Therefore, referring to the role of a sensor, there are four different kinds of sensors: (1) clusterhead (2) primary node
with an assigned cluster ID (3) complemental node with an assigned cluster ID (4) gateway. Hence, the topology of
the ad-hoc network is now represented by a hierarchical collection of clusters.
D. Phase IV: Renewing the Clusterhead and Gateway
This subsection presents a distributed method for reclustering in order to balance the network burden and prolong
the network lifetime. The operation of the scheme is based on the information of the remaining energy of a clusterhead.
Let Ei and Emaxi be the energy and the initial energy of sensor i, respectively. When a clusterhead’s energy is below
the threshold (i.e. Ei < ηch · Emaxi ), it broadcasts a message to start the reselection mechanism. Thus, its cluster
members generate new waiting times for forming new clusters according to the procedures in Phases I and II. Hence,
in this scenario, the update formulas for Phases I, II, and III are equations (1), (2), and (3) modified by a factor
5
A. Phase I
In the initialization phase, each sector of a sensor broadcasts a Hello message to its neighboring sectors. Therefore,
the number of transmissions NTx is equal to the number of sectors in the network, kNS , and the number of receptions
NRx is the sum of the neighboring sectors of each sensor. That is, NTx = kNS and NRx =
∑NS
i=1
∑k
j=1N
(j)
i ,
where N (j)i is number of neighboring sectors of sector j of sensor i. Now let N
s
Tx
and N sRx denote the number of
transmissions and receptions for determining the primary sectors, respectively. Hence, we obtain N sTx = |IAS | and
N sRx =
∑
s
(j)
i ∈IAS N
(j)
i , where s
(j)
i denotes primary sector j of sensor i and IAS is a index set of primary sectors.
Thus, the total energy consumption, Estotal, in Phase I is E
s
total = NT ·ET /ϖ+NR ·ER, where NT = kNS + |IAS |
and NR =
∑NS

B. Phase II
As a sensor, say sensor i, meets the conditions of being a clusterhead, it assigns cluster ID i to its neighboring
sensors. Then, its neighboring sensors transmit a signal to their neighbors to update cluster ID information. Therefore,
the number of transmissions of each cluster can be obtained from the number of transmissions of clusterhead i, N chTx (i),
and the number of transmissions of its cluster members, NmTx(i), which yield
N chTx (i) = |s(j)i /∈ IAS |,
NmTx(i) =
Lh∑
o=1
∑
ℓ∈I
M
(o)
i
(|s(w)ℓ /∈ IAS |+ o),
where Lh is the largest number of hops in a cluster topology and IM (o)i is the index set of members of hop o of sensor
i. Moreover, The number of receptions is related to the operation of neighboring primary sectors of clusterhead i
and the operation of neighboring communication and complemental sectors of cluster members. Thus,
N chRx(i) =
∑
s
(j)
i /∈IAS
∑
ℓ∈I
N
(j)

|s(w)ℓ ∈ IAS |,
NmRx(i) =

∑
s
(j)
ℓ ∈ICS
|N (j)ℓ |+
∑
s
(j)
ℓ /∈IAS
|N (j)ℓ |),
where IN (j)i is the index set of neighboring sectors of sector j in sensor i and ICS is the index set of communication
sectors. This procedure is applied to all clusterheads and their cluster members. Now let N cTx and N
c
Rx
denote the
number of transmissions and receptions for all clusters, respectively. Hence, N cTx=
∑
i∈ICH (N
ch
Tx
(i) + NmTx(i)), and
N cRx=
∑
i∈ICH (N
ch
Rx
(i)+NmRx(i)), where ICH is a index set of clusterheads. Therefore, the total energy consumption,
Ectotal, for cluster formation in the wireless sensor network is E

B. Energy Consumption
The second set of experiments compares the total energy consumption of cluster formation of the ACDA and that
of the CAWT. A scenario with no packet loss and no retransmission is considered, which may provide an insight
into system design and define the best possible performance bound of the proposed scheme. For the purpose of
comparison, denote the Y-axis in Figure 7 as the normalized energy consumption of each protocol based on the
transmission/reception energy dissipation of an omnidirectional antenna (i.e ETxtotal/ET or E
Rx
total/ER).
Referring to the analysis in Section III and given α = 7.5, β = 0.4, and γ = 0.3, Figure 7 shows the average
number of transmissions and receptions of random networks after applying the proposed algorithm. Figure 7 also
shows that the number of receptions tends to increase as the transmission range R increases. This implies that energy
consumption is higher for the network with larger transmission power. This can be attributed to the fact that larger
transmission power allows sensors to detect more neighbors, which increases the number of receptions when assigning
cluster ID or updating cluster ID information.

VI. CONCLUSION
This project has presented a randomized, decentralized algorithm for organizing the sensors of an ad hoc network
into clusters. Directional antennas, random waiting timers, and a neighbor-based criterion are used to form clusters
automatically. The solution combines the advantages of clustering and the strength of directional antennas to achieve
both connectivity and sufficient coverage in wireless sensor networks.
Although the proposed strategy achieves effective network topology control, further experimental and theoretical
extensions are possible. In our future work, we plan to involve more mechanisms to make the protocol faultless
and practical, such as developing a new algorithm for sensor scheduling and power management, searching for an
appropriate transmission range for sensors with directional antennas, and proposing efficient mechanisms to make
protocol suitable for adaptive topology management.

一、參加會議經過 
 
Technologies, standards and procedures on their own provide little and or no 
meaningful service. It is essential that pervasive healthcare environments, through a 
combined approach of data collection, data correlation and data presentation, assist 
health care professionals in delivering high levels of patient care, and empower 
individuals and their families for self-care and health management. We presented our 
paper in a poster session, which was highly popular judging by the high number of 
attendees. We have a great discussion on pervasive healthcare problems with Professor 
Ehsan O. Sheybani at Virginia State University. I believe this special experience will be 
a very important step in my research progress.

Telling Traces  
Even the simplest mobile phone can be used to capture time-stamped self-reported 
data. These "tweets with a purpose" can be integrated with web-based applications 
that prompt, store, analyze, and visualize; providing individuals with traces of their 
health status, exposures, and behaviors. Moreover, more modern smartphones can 
be programmed to automatically record GPS coordinates, wireless fingerprints, 
accelerometer readings, and the digital exhaust of other mobile apps. These 
personal data streams can in turn be processed to create detailed, geocoded, 
time-stamped, activity logs of our everyday lives. When combined with the wealth 
of available spatial data and models these activity traces can be used to make 
strong inferences. Unlike much of the data captured by Internet and social media 
services, activity and self-report traces are already personally identified, legally 
reusable, and easily available to the individual. We have the opportunity to learn 
from our own traces, and at the same time feedback data to clinicians to inform 
clinical care.

Abstract-Exercise training is a crucial component of pul-
monary rehabilitation for patients with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). Based on fuzzy logic control and 
wireless sensor networking, we develop an approach with cali-
bration, rehabilitation, artifact/safety monitoring and endpoint 
decision (CRASE) to perform adaptive subject exercise training 
and monitoring. This preliminary study investigates an exercise 
training model with overload principle and safety concern. The 
experimental results show that the proposed CRASE scheme is 
promising to efficiently put exercise training into practice for 
home-based rehabilitation. 
Keywords-pulmonary rehabilitation; chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease; fuzzy control; wireless sensor networking. 
I. INTRO DUCTION 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a 
chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized 
by progressive downhill of the lung functions and frequent 
systemic involvement [ 1] .  The characteristics of COPD are 
the presence of lots of immunocytes in airways and the 
decrease of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 
due to airflow limitation. The most recent international treat­
ment guideline suggests that early introducing of pulmonary 
rehabilitation (PR) and pharmacological management may 
help improve the quality of life and reduce the frequency of 
acute exacerbation [2] , [3]. The incremental shuttle walking 
test (ISWT) has recently been proposed as an effective and 
reproducible alternative to the conventional 6-min walking 
(6MWT) in exercise tolerance evaluation of patients with 
COPD [4]. The initial procedure of the conventional ISWT 
is that the subject walks a lO-meter distance between two 
cones with a walking speed of 30 mlmin as defined in Stage 
1 (Table I). This walking speed increases 10 meters per 
minute until the speed reaches 140 mlmin as defined in Stage 
12. The endpoint of the test is determined when the subject 
is too short of breathing to keep up with the pace or is 
unable to complete the shuttle in the limited time [5]. The 
total distance and predicted V02 max = 0.025 * distance + 
4. 19 may be the outcome for pulmonary rehabilitation. 
Although the ISWT conforms overload principle [6] and 
maximum sustained voluntary ventilation in exercise, the

inflexible termination criterion of the training testing [5] may 
not help improve the max oxygen uptake (V02 max) of the 
subject. Moreover, because of the difficulty for defining the 
crisp endpoint with the predicted maximum heart rate (MHR 
= 220 - Age) [7] which depends on subjects' oxygen uptake, 
rest, deep breath and other non-physiological factors, it is 
essential to adaptively control the intensity and endurance 
in training-sensitive zone with safety consideration such 
that improving cardiorespiratory fitness is achievable. The 
recent study shows that the increment of endurance walking 
capacity with ground walk training is more than that with 
upright cycle ergometer in pulmonary rehabilitation for 
people with COPD [8] .  Currently, the design of walking 
exercise with overload and training-sensitive zone guidance 
is not reported in the literature. 
Accordingly, in contrast to the conventional ISWT method 
which surveys the subject manually [9], we develop an adap­
tive shuttle walking (ASW) as an exercise training model 
and propose the Calibration, Rehabilitation, Artifact/Safety 
monitoring and Endpoint decision (CRASE) protocol, which 
applies networked sensing and fuzzy characteristics to ex­
plore the performance in adaptive shuttle walking subjects, 
to optimize the shuttle walking endpoint, and to interpret 
the measurements in the cases as natural language variables 
such as "fast" and "too slow" with the developed fuzzy

inputs, the fuzzy outputs, and the fuzzy rules are described 
as follows. 
I) Fuzzy Inputs: The fuzzy input 1 is the percentage of 
MHR within the training-sensitivity zone [7]. We specify 
a range of values as input I, [min max] = [20 100] ; the 
member functions (as shown in Figure 3 (left)) are 'VS': 
'trapmf', [20 20 30 35] ; 'S': 'trimf', [30 50 70]; 'F': 
'trapmf', [60 70 90 100] ; 'TF': 'trimf', [90 100 100], where 
VS = very slow, S = slow, F = fit, and TF = too fast. 
The fuzzy input 2 is the difference between the rehabili­
tation level and the individual walking speed, 1':,. V (m/sec). 
The endpoint is determined when the individual is too short 
of breathing to keep up with the pace [5]. Here a range 
of values are specified as input 2, [min max] = [-2 2] ; the 
member functions (as shown in Figure 3 (middle)) are 'N': 
'traprnf', [-2 -2 - 1 0] ; 'S': 'trimf', [-0.5 0 0.5]; 'P': 'trapmf', 
[0 1 2 2] , where N = negative, S = small, and P = positive. 
2) Fuzzy Output: The fuzzy output is the degree of 
rehabilitation with the average per shuttle. We specify a 
range of values as fuzzy output, [min max] = [0 I] ; the 
member functions (Figure 3 (right)) are denoted as 'Main­
tain': 'trimf', [0.25 0.5 0.75]; 'Check': 'trimf', [0 0 O. I] ; 
'Stop': 'trimf', [0 0. 1 0.25] ; 'Down': 'trimf', [0.1 0.25 0.5] ; 
'Up' : 'trimf', [0.5 0.75 I] ; 'Up_Jump':'trimf', [0.75 1 I]. 
The outputs are defined by the template rhythm of sound 
guidance depicted in Table I: (I) Maintain: The rehabilitation 
level (RL) is followed with the original defined setting; 
(2) Check: The individual should check Np or Nr before 
doing the exercise; (3) Stop: The individual should stop the 
exercise for reaching the end point or safety consideration; 
(4) Down: RL decreases the training intensity to a level 
below after current shuttle; (5) Up: RL increases the training 
intensity to a level above after current shuttle; (6) Up_Jump: 
RL directly increases two stages of exercise rhythm after 
current shuttle. 
3) Fuzzy Rules: Based on the training-sensitivity zone 
and overload principle as suggested in Table I, twelve fuzzy 
rules are developed. Table II expresses the fuzzy logic in 
terms of fuzzy IF-THEN rules, which implements a mapping 
149 
of input functions into output functions. For instance, IF 
MHR (%) is F (fit) AND 1':,. V (m/sec) is N (negative), THEN 
the output (i.e. the degree of rehabilitation with the average 
per shuttle) is 'Maintain'.

III. CASE STUDY AND PERFORMAN CE EVALUATION 
For the purpose of comparison, the fuzzy inference system 
is applied to simulate the endpoint decision and survey the 
performances of two subjects undergoing the conventional 
ISWT with artificial monitoring and undergoing the pro­
posed CRASE protocol and ASW model, respectively. Note 
that the recorded physical data of real subjects with the 
conventional ISWT are applied for each case study. 
Subject I: A 68 y/o male with MHR = 152 who ended 
up the test because of shortness of breath (SOB). Figure 
4 shows that the total walking distance was 375 m (Stage 
7) with a duration of 250 seconds and heart rate reached 
222 beats per minute at 190 seconds by manual monitoring. 
Using the proposed CRASE protocol to survey the recorded 
data, decision of "Up" is made in Stage1, 2, 3 and 4, 
respectively. Check point of "Safety" is at 190 seconds. 
Afterwards, the CRASE output should be "Down" before 
entering Stage 6 and should be "Stop" at 255 seconds. Thus, 
the proposed CRASE shows the outputs of "Up", "Up", 
"Up", "Up", "Down" and "Stop" in Stage (S) I, S2, S3, 
S4, S5 and S6, respectively. 
Subject 2: 6 1  y/o male with MHR = 159 who ended up 
the test because of SOB. The total walking distance was 
160 m (Stage 4) through 160 seconds and heart rate reached 
126 beats per minute at 145 seconds by manual monitoring 
(Figure 5). Similarly, Using the proposed CRASE protocol
