英 文 摘 要 ： We attempted to design and synthesize novel 
electroluminescent and chemosensory materials. We 
choose crown ether as recognition moiety due to the 
natural characteristic of forming complex with 
cations. Combination of crown ether receptor with 
conjugated polymer backbone renders amplified 
fluorescence and absorption spectral variations in 
the presence of different metal ions. A 
copolyfluorene (PFC) containing pendant crown ether 
as receptor was synthesized to investigate its 
recognition ability to metal cations. The PL response 
of PFC demonstrated high selectivity toward Ru3+ and 
Fe3+ ions. The PFC shows high sensitivity for Ru3+ 
with detecting limit as low as 1 ppm. Unexpectedly, 
the PFC was an efficient emitter for 
electroluminescent device as well. To enhance 
sensitivity of the crown chemosensor, we synthesized 
a new chemosensory monoaza-15-crown-5 (CN-azacrown) 
with electron-withdrawing cyano group to promote 
intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. To 
study the effect of electron-withdrawing group upon 
sensory characteristics of fluorescent chemosensors a 
stilbene derivative H-azacrown without electron-
withdrawing group was also synthesized to compare its 
selectivity and sensitivity toward metal ions with

hyperbranched structure suppresses undesirable excimer/aggregate formation and 
improves film morphology, in which are beneficial to enhance PLED device performance. 
We synthesized a new trivinylfluorene monomer (M2) as branched unit to obtain 
hyperbranched polymer (HOFC) via Heck reaction to discuss the effects of 
hyperbranched structure on sensory characteristics and EL device performance (chapter 7). 
The corresponding analogous linear polymer (LOFC) was also synthesized for 
comparsion. The Stern-Volmer coefficient (Ksv) of HOFC toward Ru3+ ion is higher than 
LOFC slightly, which might be attributed to reduced conjugation caused by the twist 
(41.6o) at 4-position of fluorene units. This twist is unfavorable to the migration of 
excitons through the branch unit. Accordingly, the sensing properties of HOFC and 
LOFC are comparable. Moreover, hyperbranched HOFC reveals homogeneous film 
morphology. Double-layer electroluminescent devices, using thermally cross-linked HFC 
or LFC as emitting layer, showed that the turn-on voltage, maximum luminance and 
maximum luminance efficiency of HFC device (4.1 V, 7132 cd/m2 and 1.3 cd/A) 
surpassed those of LFC device (6.2 V, 331 cd/m2, 0.22 cd/A).  
Further, we used trivinylfluorene to react with dibromotriphenylamine to synthesize 
thermally cross-linkable hyperbranched polymer (HTP and HTPOCH3) serving as 
hole-transporting layer (HTL) in chapter 8. The resulted polymers demonstrated high 
solvent-resistance after thermal curing. The performance of MEH-PPV device (maximum 
luminance: 9310 cd/m2, luminance efficiency: 0.26 cd/A) was effectively enhanced by 
inserting the thermally cross-linked HTP or HTPOCH3 as HTL (HTP: 12610 cd/m2, 
0.32 cd/A; HTPOCH3: 14060 cd/m2, 0.33 cd/A).  
Combination of conjugated polyfluorene with crown ether gives rise to promising 
multi-functional polymers applicable in electroluminescent and chemosensory areas. The 
crown ether demostrats specifically recognizes metal ions with the conjugated backbone 
amplifying the signal produced by binding with the metal cations, leading to high 
sensitivity characteristics. The enhancement in PLED device performance can be 
attributed to polar characteristic of crown ether promote compatibility between emitting 
layer and cathode (Ca). To enhance sensitivity, we introduced electron-withdrawing group 
(CN) to facilitiate ICT process. This design concept can be applied to sketch new 
conjugated-based chemosensors. Furthermore, the novel branched monomer M2 was used 
to synthesize hole-transporting hyperbranched polymers. Their hole-transporting ability 
can be readily adjusted by replacing triphenylamine moiety with other hole-transporting 
groups.

   The band gape, determined by the onset of absorption band in film state is 2.95 eV.3 
Janietz et al. used the onset of redox waves in cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments to 
estimate the Ip and EA energies of poly(9,9-diotylfluorene) (PFO) (Figure 1-1-4). The 
gap between the obtained energy levels Ip－EA ~ 3.8 eV is higher than the one that 
calculated by the onset of absorption band. Although optical absorption and 
electrochemistry test are not expected to be the same.4 The Ip and the bans gap of PFO is 
-5.6±0.05 eV and 3.1±0.1 eV by using ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(UPS and XPS) measurements, which is also much close to the optical band gap than to 
the value deduced from electrochemistry in film.5 Considering the application in 
polymeric light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), the HOMO-LUMO levels of PF can be 
reasonable well-matched by the work function of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (-5.1 eV) and Ca 
electrode (-2.9 eV), which are beneficial for hole and electron injection, respectively.

rearrangement resulted in enhanced excimer formation.7

Yu et al. first reported the introduction of spiro links onto part of the PF backbone 
(Figure 1-1-2-2).8 The aim of this modification was to increase the glass-transition (Tg) 
of the polymers, so that moderate heating during the device operation would not result in 
a aggregate formation. A 90o geometry of spiro-annulated bifluorene units prevents 
interchain aggregation and the long-alkyl substitutes in second comonomer improve the 
solubility. The resulted spiro-copolymer show higher Tg than poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene) 
(PHF). Consequently, no long wavelength emission was found for films annealed at 100 
oC. The resulting spiro-funcationalized PF copolymer, exhibits narrower EL emission 
spectra than polyalkylfluorene attributed to the less dense molecular packing. However, 
the device [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK)/spiro-copolymer/Ca/Al] 
exhibits low efficiency (0.54%), low luminance (15 cdm–2), and high turn-on voltage (7 
V). 
Müllen’s group was the first to report using Dendron substituent to sterically hinder 
the excimer or aggregate formation, which delivers pure blue emission in substituted 
polyfluorene material.9 The polymerization was achieved by Yamamoto coupling and 
the polymer chain was terminated by arylation with bromobenzene. The resulting 
polymer is soluble in common organic solvent and forms homogeneous films. A PLED 
device with configuration of ITO/PEDOT/Dendron-substituted polymer/Ca/Al gave 
pure blue emission and no green emission was observed at driving voltages up to 12 V.

Except for their manifold use in organic and polymer electronics, fluorene-based 
π-conjugated materials have recently found widespread applications as sensors. The 
sensing process is dominated by noncovalent interactions between the analyte and 
sensor molecules. A high sensitivity toward subtle changes in the environments is made 
possible due to signal enhancement because of the conjugation via the polymer or 
oligomer backbones. Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy often allows an easy and 
sensitive detection. When metal binding ligands such as bipyridine derivatives are used 
as comonomers, APFs are obtained that display different sensitivities toward transition 
metal ions, depending on the complexation strength. In 2001, Huang and co-workers 
published a study concerning the metal ion sensing properties of three structurally 
related conjugated polymers, the main chains of which incorporated 2,2’-bipyridine 
moieties as shown in Figure1-1-2-5.11 The purpose of study was to understand the effect 
that the structure of the polymer backbone has on metal ion sensitivity. They synthesized 
conjugated polymers via Suzuki, Wittig-Horner, and Sonogashira polymerizations, 
respectively. All the polymers are sensitive to the existence of a variety of transition 
metal ions due to the chelation between the 2,2’-bipyridyl moieties and the metal ions. 
An obvious difference in response sensitivity is observed among the three polymers, 
which is attributed to the different backbone rigidity of the three polymers caused by the 
three different linkers. The results suggest the use of C-C single bond linker in the 
molecular design toward the 2,2’-bipyridyl-based conjugated polymer chemosensors for 
achieving higher sensing sensitivity. 
Since most of fluorene-based materials only dissolve in rather apolar organic 
solvents, they require special adaptations of their chemical structures to be used in 
aqueous media. The most commonly used strategy to achieve this goal is the attachment 
of ionic side chains to the 9-positions of the fluorenes (Figure1-1-2-6). In 2005 Wang

   Another important property of PF homopolymers is their thermotropic liquid 
crystallinity, which allows the orientation of these polymers on rubbed polyimide layers. 
At elevated temperatures, PFs generally develop nematic mesophases, which can 
become chiral (cholesteric) in the case of enantiomerically pure branched side chains. 
Dyreklev et al were the first to demonstrate the concept of polarized light emission can 
also be exploited in the case of PLEDs.13 In their pioneering work, they employed a 
modestly oriented conjugated polymer, and as a result, the emission of device was only 
moderately polarized, as evidenced by the report ratio of the electroluminescent 
intensities observed through a linear polarizer oriented parallel and perpendicular to the 
direction of uniaxial alignment as shown in Figure 1-1-2-7.

In 1982, Vincett et al. reported blue EL from anthracene sublimed onto oxidized 
aluminum as one electrode, and thermally evaporated semitransparent gold as the other 
electrode, and were able to reduce voltage considerably, for example, to 12 V. In 1983, 
the discovery of EL of poly(vinyl carbazole) led to a search for other electroluminescent 
materials covering other ranges of the visual spectrum.16 However, the development of 
electroluminescent organic devices was not successful at that point due to the relatively 
poor lifetimes and relatively low efficiencies. During 1987–1989, the seminal work of 
Tang and Van Slyke demonstrated efficient EL in two-layer sublimed molecular film 
devices comprised of a hole-transporting layer of an aromatic diamine and an emissive 
layer of 8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq3) as shown in the Figure 1-2-1-2.17 This 
result provided a basic design for light-emitting diode architecture which was applicable 
to systems employing low molecular weight electroluminescent materials either in neat 
form or in inert polymer matrix, or to electro-optically active polymers or copolymers. 
Indium–tin oxide (ITO) was used as hole injection electrode and a magnesium– silver 
(Ag:Mg) alloy as electron-injecting electrode.

In fact, advancements in semiconducting polymers have progressed steadily, since 
their discovery in 1977 by Heeger et al. at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) has been one of the most studied polymers. These facts 
led to the discovery in 1990 by the Cambridge group in England that it was possible to 
use PPV as the emitting element in a polymer-based LED (the device architecture: 
ITO/PPV/Al).18 The first PLED device architecture is shown as Figure 1-2-1-3-(a). 
Figure 1-2-1-3-(b) depicts the mechanism of electroluminescent as four steps: 1).

1-2-2. The Electroluminescent Devices. 
At present, two-layer structure represents the preferred embodiment for the 
commercial PLED device, illustrated in Figure 1-2-2-1. The hole-transporting layer 
(HTL) material film is laminated over the transparent ITO anode, over which is applied 
the emitting layer (EML) film. A cathode possessing a low work function is deposited to 
provide electron injection into the π* band of the EML. Afterwards, the whole device 
may receive an encapsulation of some kind to improve its durability. In Figure 1-2-2-1, 
the energy band diagram illustrates the equivalence of the valence band with the 
ionization potential (IP) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), as well as 
the equivalence of the conduction band with the electron affinity (EA) and the lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The work function, ψ, is also shown with 
reference to the vacuum potential, Ev.

LUMO. Likewise, the upper profile of the valence band or p state density (and therefore 
the HOMO) corresponds to the ionization potential of the material. The ionization 
potential of most organic material can be modified by choice of structure, and for the 
common conjugated polymers lies in the 5-6 eV range. As this corresponds to the 
relative magnitude of the work function of ITO, the ITO-organic semiconductor contact 
is, in some cases, close to ohmic. As amorphous organic films are disordered, the notion 
of a band edge seems oversimplified, especially when these materials can easily possess 
impurities left over from the synthesis process, which gives rise to inner gap states. In 
reality, the density of states possesses some distribution about the mean quoted value. 
c) The hole-transporting layer (HTL) 
There are several polymers that have been preferred as hole-transporting materials. 
Poly(vinyl carbazole) (PVK) is one that has been studied extensively. In some cases, 
PPV has been used as a HTL, including structures employing an evaporated 
low-molecular-weight emitter. An alternative to using an intrinsic HTL is to use a 
conducting polymer to transport holes to the EML. The internal electric field in a 
conducting polymer is much lower than in a semiconducting polymer, and this will slow 
the migration of unwanted ions from the ITO through the HTL over much longer 
operating time frames. Two popular conducting polymers are polyaniline (PANI) and 
poly-(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT).28 PEDOT has a π-π* electronic bandgap 
of 1.6-1.7 eV and possesses a conductivity between 1 to 10 S cm-1. Recently, a 
commercial grade of PEDOT has become available from Bayer. 
d) The cathode metals 
Different cathode metals have been employed in device architecture with varying 
degrees of success. The most obvious change to the choice of electron-injecting media is 
to vary the electronic work function and observe device performance. Michaelson has 
summarized metallic electronic work functions,29, 30 from which we tabulate these 
relevant metal properties that could be encountered in various PLED design 
configurations (Figure 1-2-2-2). 
16 
 
extending to within 20 to 30 nm of the cathode interface.35 It is assumed that the extent 
of the combination zone is linked to the mobility of the minority carrier and the efficient 
balance of space charge limited current of both charge carriers in the device. 
 
Figure 1-2-2-3 Energy level diagram of a two-layer PLED device under forward bias.34 
 
EL occurs when singlet excitons, formed by the coulombic combination of electron 
and hole pairs with opposite spin states, radiatively decay to the molecular ground state. 
This represents the same excited state that is formed when long-wave UV radiation is 
absorbed by the material in the PL process. The similarity (and differences) between the 
EL and PL spectra indicate the extent of similarity in accessing the associated electronic 
states of the molecular species.36-38  
PLED device architecture comes in two varieties: single-layer and multiple-layer 
structures as show in following: 
1-2-3. Single-layer devices 
The single-layer device rely on the emitting material to carry out the efficient 
injection and transport of both electrons (the minority charge carrier) and holes (the 
majority charge carrier) as well as facilitate the radiative decay of a narrow distribution 
of excited molecular states to ground. There are published accounts of single-layer 
PLED devices being operated using both PPV and its derivatives as the active medium. 
Unique difficulties arise for devices based on a single organic layer, however. It is 
difficult to balance the injection and transport of the two charge carriers in a 
single-material matrix over a reasonable voltage range. Any imbalance results in a 
relative increase in drive voltage and the subsequent loss of luminance efficiency from 
ideal conditions. Also, oxygen as well as metal ions are leached out of the ITO matrix 
into the EML under long-term action of the applied electric field, which can be as high 
as 107 V/cm. This leads to oxygen poisoning of the organic layer and generates metallic 
quenching sites for EL.39 
EL is the result of radiative recombination of electrons and holes in a material 
18 
 
incorporation of electron- or hole-transporting segments into the side-chain or backbone 
of the conjugated polymers to balance electrons and holes injection, and accordingly the 
architectures of EL polymers which possess both hole- and electron-transporting 
segments are widely adapted. 
1-2-4. Multi-layer PLED devices 
The motivation behind developing a multi-layer PLED system is to separate the 
active layer from the ITO and accommodate charge-transport specialization for both 
carriers using different molecular structures (Figure 1-2-4-1). Three layers or more can 
accomplish the functional separation of an ion-buffering layer over the anode from the 
hole- and electron-transporting media as well as provide an emitting layer. However, the 
cost associated with manufacturing increases commensurately with the number of layers. 
With device design for manufacturability as a guide, a two-layer design becomes the 
minimum number of layers that provides anode-ion buffering and charge-carrier 
transport differentiation. The first polymeric film over the anode becomes both the HTL 
and the ion-buffering layer, and the second film becomes both the electron-transporting 
layer and the EML. The OLED field has moved to adopt a two-layer PLED structure as 
the preferred embodiment. This two-layer device is an analog to the p-n junction LED, 
although in this case we are limiting ourselves to considerations employing only 
undoped intrinsic semiconductor systems. 
20 
 
various sensor devices among other materials.40 
Many scientists, including chemists, biologists, clinical biochemists and 
environmentalists, are interested in detecting cations. Many cations are involved in 
biological processes such as transmission of nerve impulses, muscle contraction, 
regulation of cell activity, etc. It is also well known that mercury, lead and cadmium are 
toxic for organisms. In medicine, it is important to control the serum levels of lithium in 
patients under treatment for manic depression, and potassium in the case of high blood 
pressure. The comment available analytical methods for the detection of cations are 
flame photometry, atomic absorption spectrometry, ion sensitive electrodes, electron 
microprobe analysis and neutron activation analysis, in which are expensive and often 
require large quantity of samples.41 In contrast, the methods based on fluorescent sensors 
offer distinct advantages: fluorescence measurements are usually very sensitive (single 
molecule detection is possible), low cost, easily performed, and versatile, offering 
subnanometer spatial resolution with submicron visualisation and submillisecond 
temporal resolution. Furthermore, many opportunities exist for modulating the 
photophysical properties of a luminophore, such as the introduction of proton-, energy- 
and electron-transfer processes, the presence of heavy-atom effects, changes of 
electronic density, and the destabilisation of a non-emissive nπ* excited state.42 
Moreover, remote sensing is possible by using optical fibers with a molecular sensor 
immobilized at the tip. Therefore, considerable efforts are being made to develop 
selective fluorescent sensors for cation detection. A chemosensor is a molecular system 
for which the physicochemical properties change upon interaction with a chemical 
species in such a way as to produce a detectable signal. The construction of a useful 
molecular-based sensory material generally requires a reversible recognition element 
and a reporter, so that the changes in color, emission, or even the redox potential are 
reflected to a certain recognition event.11 A chemosensor is usually comprised of a 
recognition moiety and a signal transducer group (Figure 1-3-1-1). The signal transducer 
converts the information, caused by the interaction between recognition moiety and 
analyte, into an optical signal and is expressed as changes in photo-physical 
characteristics of the fluorophore. These aspects are related to the field of 
photophysics.41 
 
22 
 
The monocyclic polyethers called crown ethers can be defined as uncharged 
macroheterocycles containing the repeat unit (–O–CH2–CH2–)n (Fig. 1-3-2-1). They are 
designed as molecular hosts able to complex alkali and alkaline earth cations, transition 
metal cations and ammonium cations.44 The stability of the crown ether-metal ion 
complex is dependent on the number of ether donor atoms. Of particular importance is 
the size and shape of the cavity relative to the cation siz. Though a given crown ether 
tends to form its most stable complexes with ions having diameters comparable to that 
of its opened cavity, it can also form complexes with ions of larger size. When the ion is 
able to fit within the cavity, the crown ether-metal ion complex forms in a 1:1 ratio. If 
the ion is larger than that of the crown cavity, there is a tendency for the crown ether 
moieties to ‘‘sandwich’’ the metal ions between adjacent crown units.45 
 
 
Figure 1-3-2-1. Some example of crown ethers and related compounds.44 
 
1-3-3. Crown Ether-based Chemosensor 
1-3-3-1. Principle of Photoinduced Charge Transfer46  
When a fluorophore contains an electron-donating group (often an amino group) 
conjugated to an electron-withdrawing group, it undergoes intramolecular charge 
transfer from the donor to the acceptor upon excitation by light. The consequent change 
in dipole moment results in a Stokes shift that depends on the micro-environment of the 
24 
 
 
Figure 1-3-3-1-1. Spectral displacements of PCT sensors resulting from the 
interaction of a bound cation with an electron-donating or 
electron-withdrawing group.46 
1-3-3-2. Crown Ether-based Sensors in Which Bound Cation Interacts With an 
Electron-Donating Group46 
Many fluoroionophores have been designed according to the following principle: 
the cation receptor is an azacrown containing a nitrogen atom which is conjugated to an 
electron-withdrawing group (Figure 1-3-3-2-1). Compounds PCT-1 to PCT-6 exhibit a 
common feature: the blue shift of the absorption spectrum is much larger than that of the 
emission spectrum on cation binding. Such a small shift of the fluorescence spectrum 
which is surprising at first sight can be interpreted as follows. The PCT reduces the 
electron density on the nitrogen atom of the crown, and this nitrogen atom becomes a 
noncoordinating atom because it is positively polarized. Therefore, excitation induces a 
photodisruption of the interaction between the cation and the nitrogen atom of the crown. 
The fluorescence spectrum is thus only slightly affected because most of the 
fluorescence is emitted from species in which the interaction between the cation and the 
fluorophore does not exist any more or is much weaker.  
This interpretation is supported by a thorough study of the photophysics of PCT-1 
and its complexes with Li+ and Ca2+. In particular, subpicosecond pump–probe 
spectroscopy provided compelling evidence for the disruption of the link between the 
26 
 
twist; with the latter being responsible for the main part of the emission. The existence 
of a fluorescent TICT state was also stated to be responsible for the photophysical 
properties of PCT-5. The absence of fluorescence of PCT-7 may be due to the 
formation of a nonfluorescent TICT state, and an acridinium type fluorescence is 
recovered upon binding of H+ and Ag+.  
In most cases, the change in fluorescence intensity upon cation binding in these 
PCT molecular sensors is not very large (factors of ca. two to five) as compared to PET 
sensors. A remarkable exception is offered by PCT-8 whose electron-withdrawing 
group is boron-dipyrromethene: the fluorescence enhancement factor varies from 90 for 
Li+ to 2250 for Mg2+. 
1-3-4. Conjugated-based Chemosensor.50, 51 
Chemical sensors and biosensors made of conjugated polymers (CPs) are of current 
importance due to its simple instrumentation and high sensitivity. CPs offer a myriad of 
opportunities to couple analyte receptor interactions, as well as nonspecific interactions, 
into observable (transducible) responses. A key advantage of CP-based sensors over 
devices using small molecule (chemosensor) elements is the potential of the CP to 
exhibit collective properties that are sensitive to very minor perturbations. Contrary to 
small molecules, conjugated polymers require only fractional occupancy that causes a 
series of signal transfer groups to be active as shown in Figure 1-3-4-1. In particular, the 
CP’s transport properties, electrical conductivity or rate of energy migration, provide 
amplified sensitivity. CP-based sensors have been formulated in a variety of schemes 
such as conductometric, potentiometric, colorimetric and fluorescent sensors. 
Conductometric sensors monitor the changes of electrical conductivity in response to an 
analyte interaction. This is a particularly natural sensory scheme for electrically 
conducting polymers. These measurements are easily performed by connecting two 
adjacent electrodes (often microelectrodes) with a polymer film and then measuring the 
film’s conductivity (or resistivity) as a function of analyte concentration. Potentiometric 
sensors rely on analyte-induced changes in the system’s chemical potential. The 
reversible nature of the redox processes in CPs, as well as their sensitivity to 
conformation and electrostatics, enables the development of sensors based on this 
principle. Potentiometric effects can also be used in hybrid semiconductor systems 
wherein changes to a CP’s work function affect the transport characteristics of a base 
semiconductor device. Colorimetric sensors refer to changes in a material’s absorption 
properties. Although the conjugated polymer’s absorption characteristics are largely 
determined by the local electronic structure, the sensitivity of the band gap to the 
polymer’s conformation provides a useful means to create this type of sensor. 
Fluorescence is a widely used and rapidly expanding method in chemical sensing. Aside 
from inherent sensitivity, this method offers diverse transduction schemes based upon 
28 
 
case, the sensitivity of the turn-on response will be decreased relative to the case of the 
quenching method. Specifically, removing a quenching site may not give the fully 
desired response because another quencher’s influence could overlap much of the same 
quenching volume. In recent researches, hyperbranched conjugated polymers showed 
better sensing efficiency than linear counterparts.52, 53 It has been attributed to that 
hyperbranched conjugated polymers provide greater number of possible exciton 
migration pathways through the join of branch unit, which increases the probability of 
exciton quenched by analyte as shown in Figure 1-3-4-3.

more than a century before. It is well known that direct polycondensation of A2 and B3 
monomers generally results in gelation. Thus, the crucial problem of this approach is 
how to avoid gelation, and obtain soluble three dimensional macromolecules. Soluble 
hyperbranched polymers can be obtained by stopping the polymerization through 
precipitation or end-capping prior to the critical point of gelation, by the slow addition 
of monomer, or by using special catalysts and condensation agents. 
 
Figure 1-4-1-2. The representation of a hyperbranched polymer constructed by the 
copolymerization of “A2 + B3” type monomers.54 
    Flory’s gelation theory for the ideal polymerization of A2 and B3 monomers is 
based on three assumptions: (1) equal reactivity of all A or B groups at any given stage 
of the reaction; (2) no side reactions, and the reaction restricted to the condensation of A 
and B groups; (3) no intramolecular cyclization and chain termination in the process. If 
the first assumption is invalid gelation could be avoided, leading to soluble 
hyperbranched polymers with high molar mass. The new strategy based on the 
non-equal reactivity of functional groups in specific monomer pairs was invented 
independently by Yan and Gao, and DSM Research, and further developed and extended 
by Yan and Gao. The two sorts of raw monomers would preferentially generate one type 
of ABn intermediate in situ in the initial stage of polymerization to produce 
hyperbranched macromolecules without gelation. The new strategy for preparation of 
hyperbranched polymers was named as CMM or couple-monomer strategy ( Figure 
1-4-1-3). 
32 
 
Figure 1-4-2-1. The polts for the relationship between Mw and [η] for 
macromolecules.55 
The size of dendritic polymers in solution has been shown to be greatly affected by 
solution parameters such as polarity and pH. Newkome et al., for example, have shown 
that the size of dendrimers with carboxylic acid end groups in water can be increased by 
as much as 50% on changing the pH. The dilution properties of hyperbranched polymers 
also differ from those of linear polymers. In a comparison between two alkyd resin 
systems, where one was a conventional high solid alkyd and the other based on 
hyperbranched aliphatic polyester, the conventional high solid alkyd was seen to exhibit 
a higher viscosity. A more rapid decrease in viscosity with solvent content was noted for 
the hyperbranched alkyd when the polymers were diluted. 
(b) Thermal properties 
    The classical visualization of Tg is related to relatively large segmental motions in 
the polymer chain segments and the fact that the role of the end groups diminishes above 
a certain molecular weight. This is more difficult to conceive for hyperbranched 
polymers since segmental motions are affected by the branching points and the presence 
of numerous end groups. It has instead been proposed that the glass transition for 
hyperbranched polymers is a translational movement of the entire molecule instead of a 
segmental movement. Chemical nature also affects the Tg; for example, an aliphatic 
polyester generally has a much lower Tg than an aromatic one. The Tg for polyether 
dendrimers has been found to follow a modified Flory equation where the number and 
structure of end groups are accounted. However, no complete model to predict the Tg 
for hyperbranched polymers exists since several other factors such as degree of 
branching, steric interactions due to crowding, backbone rigidity and polarity in 
combination also play an important role for the glass transition temperature. The glass 
temperature of dendritic polymers has been discussed in a paper by Stutz. 
    The thermal stability of hyperbranched polymers is related to the chemical structure 
in the same manner as for linear polymers; for example, aromatic esters are more stable 
than aliphatic ones. In one case, the addition of a small amount of a hyperbranched 
polyphenylene to polystyrene was found to improve the thermal stability of the blend as 
compared to the pure polystyrene. 
(c) Mechanical and rheological properties 
    The correct mechanical and rheological behavior is essential when introducing new 
materials onto the market. A material must possess both suitable material and processing 
properties in order to find an appropriate use. The rheological properties for 
hyperbranched polymers are characterized by a Newtonian behavior in the molten state; 
i.e., no shear thinning or thickening is observed, indicating a lack of entanglements for 
34 
 
even after annealing at 200 °C for 30 min in air.57      
 
Figure 1-4-3-2. Scheme of hyperbranched polyfluorene.57 
    In Figure 1-4-3-3, a “A2 + A’2 + B3” approach based on Suzuki polycodensation 
was developed for the hyperbranched polymer synthesis. The polymer films exhibited 
very stable blue light emission even after being annealed in the elevated temperatures in 
the N2 and air.58

(b) To elevate thermal and optical stability.59 
    In Figure 1-4-3-4, the structures and properties of the hyperbranched polymers are 
characterized and evaluated by IR, NMR, UV, PL, TGA, and optical limiting analyses. 
Most of the hb-PAs show outstanding thermal stability (Td up to 560 °C) with high 
weight residues (Wr up to 86%) after pyrolysis at 800°C. Upon photo-excitation, 
solutions of the hyperbranched polymers emit strong blue light of 400 nm with 
36 
 
a hyperbranched polymer with subsequently polymerizable vinyl groups at the periphery. 
Thermal polymerization afforded insoluble films, upon which a light-emitting polymer, 
MEH-PPV, could be spun-cast. The LEDs fabricated using the cross-linked HB-BVPA 
[hyperbranched-bis(4-vinylphenyl)aniline] exhibited comparable or superior 
performance to devices composed of conventional PEDOT-PSS as HTLs.  
(e) Enhance the sensitivity of conjugated-based chemosensor.52 
    In 2009, Yang and coworkers synthesized the fluorescent hyperbranched 
copolymer (HTP) and a linear copolymer (PTP) as a reference sample to HTP both 
containing triphenylamine and divinyl bipyridyl units were synthesized via Heck 
coupling reaction as shown in Figure 1-4-3-7. The fluorescence of the polymer in 
solution can be quenched by various transition metal ions. The effect of backbone 
structure of the conjugated polymer-based chemosensors on the sensitivity and 
selectivity in metal ions sensing have been investigated, and the quenching effect of 
HTP is more sensitive toward transition metal than linear copolymer PTP. This obvious 
quenching difference could be understood in terms of hyperbranched polymer provide 
greater number of possible exciton migration pathways, which increased the probability 
that an exciton will visit a new receptor and detect an analyte.

2-1. Common Polymerization for Electroluminescent Polymers 
Up till now, many synthesized procedures for electroluminescent polymers have 
been developed and published. However, the most common methodologies for preparing 
EL polymers are described as following. 
(a) Friedel-Craft Polymerization 
Polymerization based on oxidative coupling reactions was widely used during the 
early stages of conjugated polymeric researches. These reaction are best used with aryl 
and heterocyclic compounds which having electron-rich sites around their ring systems. 
For example, polycondensation of fluorene or substituted thiophenes can be carried out 
in the presence of FeCl3 as the oxidizing agent in chloroform. However, the molecular 
weight distributions of the polymers synthesized in this method are usually broad. 
Similar to the direct oxidative polymerization, Lewis acids, such as AlCl3, AlBr3, and 
FeCl3 can promote polymerization.62

followed by quenching with MgBr2。OEt2. The polymerization is catalyzed by a nickel 
catalyst, such asodichloro(1,1’-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene)nickel (II) 
(Ni(dppf)2Cl2). The overall reaction is controlled by the metal site to give stereoregular 
structures.63

(e) The Stille Coupling Reaction 
The Stille coupling reaction refers to the palladium-catalyzed coupling between an 
organostannane and an electrophile to form a new C-C bond.69 Advantages of this 
method are that organostannanes are insensitive to oxygen or moisture and tolerant a 
wide variety of functionalities. However, organostannanes are toxic and difficult to 
purify.

(f) Wittig and Wittig-Horner Reaction 
The reaction of an alkylidene phosphorane with an aldehyde or ketone to yield 
alkene and a phosphine oxide is called the Wittig reaction. By applying triphenyl 
phosphonium salts to couple with aldehyde, the overall reaction yields achieved are 
moderate to high, but the molecular weights are not high (ca. 10000 or less). One 
drawback of this method is the simultaneous production of cis- and trans-isomers. The 
former can be transformed into the trans-isomers by heating in the solvent containing 
iodine. The selectivity of the olefin-forming step can be improved by using 
phosphonates instead of phosphonium salts, namely, Wittig-Horner reaction. This 
variation produces almost all trans-alkenes.70

(i) Yamamoto-Type Aryl-Aryl Coupling 
Yamamoto coupling refers to the nickel-promoted C-C coupling through the 
condensation of dihaloaromatic compounds. The most widely used reagents employed 
for condensation included NiCl2 in the presence of Zn, PPh3, and bipyridine in 
dimethylformamide as solvent.75 A major advantage of this method is the 
straightforward preparation of the dihalogenated reactants. As compared to the 
FeCl3-catalyzed oxidative polymerization, Yamamoto coupling improves specificity and 
minimizes branching. A disadvantage of this method is that catalyst residues may be 
difficult to remove from the product. In addition, these nickel-catalyzed coupling 
reactions are not suitable for the synthesis of alternating copolymers. Recently, the 
nickel-mediated coupling of Yamamoto route76 has been used to prepare a variety of 
fluorene and substituted fluorene homo- and copolymers.77-79

2-2. Theory of fluorescence and phosphorescence80 
The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the 
same set of four quantum numbers. This restriction requires that no more than two 
electrons can occupy an orbital and furthermore the two must have opposed spin states. 
Under this circumstance, the spins are said to be paired. A molecular electronic state in 
which all electron spins are paired is called a singlet state, and no splitting of electronic 
energy levels occurs when the molecule is exposed to a magnetic field. When one of a 
pair of electrons of a molecule is excited to a higher energy level, either a singlet or 
triplet state is formed. In the excited singlet state, the spin of the promoted electron is 
still paired with the ground-state electron; in the triplet state, however, the spins of the 
two electrons have become unpaired and are thus parallel. These states can be 
represented as shown in Figure 2-2-1 where the arrows represent the direction of spin. 
46 
 
 
Figure 2-2-2 The energy-level diagram for a typical photoluminescent molecule. 
Moreover, an excited molecule can return to its ground state by a combination of 
several mechanistic steps. As shown in Figure 2-2-2 the straight vertical arrows, two of 
these steps, fluorescence and phosphorescence, involve the emission of a photon of 
radiation. The other deactivation steps, indicated by wavy arrows, are radiationless 
processes. The favored deactivation process of excited state to ground state is the one 
that minimize the lifetime of excited state. Thus if deactivation by fluorescence is rapid 
with respect to the radiationless process, such emission is observed. On the other hand, 
if a radiationless process path has a more favorable rate constant, fluorescence is either 
absent or less intense. As consequence, the average lifetime of an excited triplet state 
may range from 10-4 to several seconds, as compared with average lifetime of 10-5 to 
10-8s for an excited singlet state. 
Photoluminescence is limited to a relatively small number of systems incorporating 
structural and environmental features that case the rate of radiationless relaxation or 
deactivation processes to be slowed to point where the emission reaction can compete 
kinetically. In solution, the excess vibrational energy is immediately lost as a 
consequence of collisions between the molecules of excited species with the solvent; the 
result is an energy transfer and a minuscule increase in temperature of the solvent. The 
relaxation process is so efficient that average lifetime of a vibrational excited molecule 
is 10-12 s or less, a period significantly shorter than the average lifetime of an 
electronically excited state. As a consequence, fluorescence from solution, when it 
48 
 
example is the reaction of hydrogen with chlorine, in which a few hundred molecules of 
hydrochloric acid are typically formed per quantum of blue light absorbed. In optical 
spectroscopy, the quantum yield is the probability that a given quantum state is formed 
from the system initially prepared in some other quantum state. For example, a singlet to 
triplet transition quantum yield is the fraction of molecules that, after being photoexcited 
into a singlet state, cross over to the triplet state. The fluorescence quantum yield is 
defined as the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons 
absorbed.  
The fluorescent quantum yield Φ is determined by the relative rate constants for 
the processes by which the lowest excited singlet state is deactivated, namely 
fluorescence (kf), intersystem crossing (ki), external conversion (kec), internal conversion 
(kic), predissociation (kpd), and dissociation (kd). It can be express there relationship as 
following equation 2.1. 
=
kfΦ
kf + ki + kec + kic + kpd + kd           [eq. 2.1] 
The magnitude of kf , kpd, and kd are mainly dependent upon chemical structure; the 
remaining constants are strongly influenced by environment and to a somewhat lesser 
extent by structure. 
2-4. The Emission of Intermolecular Interaction 
From a theoretical study of PPV,81 the red-shift of the emitting peaks was as the 
result of increasing chain length, and the effective conjugation length were theoretically 
estimated to be 10–17 repeat units.82 However, experimental work with oligomer models 
led to the conclusion that the effective conjugation length of PPV in solid state is no 
larger than 7–10 units.83 In the studies of PPV derivatives, the spectral shifts (absorption 
and/or photoluminescence) from dilute solution to high concentration or solid state are 
usually observed. These shifts which do not originate from single polymeric chain are 
considered as contribution from intermolecular interaction of the polymers. Generally, 
the EL polymers consist of planar and rigid structures (for example, benzene ring). 
Therefore, in solid state, their chains are easy to stack and result in the overlap of 
conjugation. However, electroluminescents originated from interchain excitons which 
contributed from the delocalization of electron are usually observed and discussed. The 
delocalization stabilizes the excited state and shift emission to longer wavelength. So far, 
the emissions resulted from intermolecular interaction are regarded as the formation of 
excimers, exciplexes, electroplex, or aggregation. Their definitions are described as 
follows:84 
50 
 
molecular aggregates has a long tradition. Early theoretical contribution by T. Förster 
and D. L. Dexter were based on an incoherent rate equation approach.  
 
Figure 2-4-2 Exciton splitting in dimers for parallel and head-to-tail geometries of 
the constituent molecules.86 
Physical dimers are well known in organic molecules, and are formed from a weak 
interaction (i.e. no chemical bonds are formed) between two neighboring molecules. The 
dimerization causes a splitting of the exciton level into a higher and lower lying level.86 
The optical transitions allowed depend on the orientation of the transition dipoles of the 
constituent molecules, as shown in Figure 2-4-2. If the dipoles are parallel, transitions to 
one of the levels are forbidden. If the dipoles are not parallel then transitions to both 
levels are allowed. Knox has studied the case of randomly oriented transition dipoles 
and has found that on average the lower-lying level has lower oscillator strength.87 
Physical dimers generally have a broad emission spectrum. Evidence of inter-chain 
interactions in the conjugated oligomer, including the formation of physical dimers, has 
recently been reported by Yassar et al.88 A dimer can also form between an excited 
molecule and its unexcited neighbor, even though there would be a repulsion between 
them in the ground state. This sort of dimer, which only exists in the excited state, is 
known as an excimer. 
The formation of excimer is that an excited molecule is close to an unexcited 
molecule (identical molecule) around 0.3~0.4 nm, the π-stacking between these 
molecules split their molecular orbitals as shown in the Figure 2-4-3.89

Figure 2-4-5 Poly(fluorene) derivatives with large side groups (left) or spiro 
architecture (right).91 
Some EL materials emit a new peak only in EL, but not in PL. A similar 
phenomenon has also been found in devices with two materials as a binary blend or as a 
bilayer. The electric-field-induced complex was termed “electroplex”. Electroplex 
emission is formed by recombination of electrons and holes in acceptor and donor 
molecules, respectively. For example, the formation of electroplex can be found in the 
following polymer containing aromatic oxadiazole acceptor and carbazole donor 
moieties (Figure 2-4-6).92 
 
Figure 2-4-6 An EL polymer was observed formation of electroplex.92 
2-5. Förster and Dexter Energy Transfer93-95 
Molecules can transfer excitation energy in a number of ways including radiation 
(trivial radiative) energy transfer (for instance, reabsorption) and radiationless 
(non-trivial radiative) energy transfer (for instance, Dexter and Förster mechanism). The 
mechanism of these processes is shown as follows.

D* moves to the LUMO of A. Energy transfer requires that the wave functions overlap 
between D and A. The quantum mechanical state consisting of an excited electron and 
an unoccupied HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital) (a hole) at the same 
molecule is called Frenkel exciton. According different mechanisms, the Förster type 
and Dexter energy transfer are introduced as follows: 
(a) Förster type energy transfer  
A mechanism of excitation energy transfer which can occur between molecular 
entities separated by distances considerably exceeding the sum of their van der Waals 
radii. It is described in terms of an interaction between the transition dipole moments (a 
dipolar mechanism) as shown in Figure 2-5-3. 
 
Figure 2-5-3 The Förster type energy transfer. 93-95 
An example of energy transfer between Alq3 (donor) and DCM (acceptor) is 
depicted as follows: (Figure 2-5-4) 
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of the excited-state is transferred 
energy from the initially excited donor to an acceptor. Energy transfer occurs without the 
appearance of a photon and is the result of long-range dipole-dipole interactions between 
the donor and acceptor. The rate of energy transfer depends upon the following factors: 
1. The extent of spectral overlap between the emission of the energy donor and the 
absorption of energy acceptor. 
2. The quantum yield of the donor. 
3. The relative orientation of the donor and acceptor transitions dipoles. 
4. The distance between the donor and acceptor molecules. 
56 
 
to that of the lowest energy singlet ICT excited state (S1). The orientation of the solvent 
dipoles neighboring the thermally equilibriated S0 state would therefore be distributed in 
an unbiased manner. Upon photon absorption, the Franck-Condon S1 state is populated 
with the solvent dipole orientational distribution being conserved. Hence the solvent 
dipolar effects on the charge separation within the S1 state largely neutralize within the 
time scale of the absorption experiment. In contrast, the longer time scale of the 
emission experiment means that the solvent dipoles can relax around the S1 state in 
response to the charge separation. The field, due to the oriented solvent dipoles, is now 
non-zero and is responsible for perturbation of the thermally equilibriated S1 and 
Franck-Condon S0 states.  
When a molecule emits the light, the energy difference between the excited state 
(S1) and the ground state (S0) in non-polar solvent is larger than in the polar solvent so 
that blue shift will occur in the fluorescence spectrum.

2-7-2. Static Quenching. 
Static quenching frequently becomes a complicating factor in the analysis of 
quenching data, but it can also be valuable information to explain about the binding 
mechanism between the fluorescent sample and the quencher.   
The quenching of complex form between fluorophore M and quencher Q may be 
described by the following mechanism: 
a) M + Q　→ MQ                           Complex formation 
b) M + hν1 → M* → M + hν2                Fluorescence 
c) MQ + hν1 → (MQ*) → MQ + heat          Quenching by the complex 
Quenching can also occur as a result of the formation of a non-fluorescent complex 
between the fluorophore and quencher. When this complex absorbs light, it immediately 
returns to the ground state without emission of a photon.  
The dependence of the fluorescence intensity upon quencher concentration for 
static quenching is easily derived by consideration of the association constant for 
complex formation. This constant is given by 
]][[

QF
QFKS −=
                
[eq. 2.3] 
Where [F-Q] is the concentration of the complex, [F] is the concentration of 
uncomplexed fluorophore, and [Q] is the concentration of quencher. If the complexed 
species is non-fluorescent, then the fraction of the fluorescence that remains, F0/F, is 
given by the fraction of the total fluorophores that are not complexed, f =F0/F.

cell. This step is necessary for solvent with low vapor pressures. The electrolyte, 
added to enhance conductivity and to minimize double-layer and migration 
current effects, is chosen on the basis of solubility in a given solvent as well as 
inertness toward the electroactive substance and its electrolysis products. The 
tetraalkylammonium salts are the most commonly used nonaqueous electrolytes. 
Tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBATFB) and tetrabutylammonium 
hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP) are recommended that TBAHFP in acetonitrile 
has a particularly large useful potential range of +3.4 to -2.9 V (vs. SCE). The 
most common reference electrode (RE) systems used in aqueous solutions are 
Ag/AgCl and the calomel electrode. To avoid large junction potentials, the RE 
solvent should be as close in nature as possible to the cell solvent system. Often 
potentials are calibrated with a standard, such as ferrocence (FOC) or 
cobaltocene.  
The diagrammatic curves of cyclic voltammetry were measured on BAS 
CV-50W at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere using indium-tin oxide 
(ITO) glass (polymer-coated) as the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as 
the reference electrode and a platinum wire electrode as the auxiliary electrode, 
supporting in 0.1 M (n-Bu)4NClO4 in acetonitrile. The energy levels were 
calculated using the ferrocence (FOC) value of -4.8 eV with respect to vacuum 
level, which is defined as zero.

4-1. Introduction 
Electroluminescent (EL) polymers have attracted considerable attention among 
scientists due to their potential applications as emitting layer in polymer light-emitting 
diodes (PLEDs). The most extensively studied EL polymers are the linear conjugated 
ones, such as poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV),18 polyfluorene (PF)103 and their 
derivatives.104, 105 The emission color of EL conjugated polymers is tunable through 
molecular design, whereas its solution-processing is possible after appropriate derivation. 
These characteristics are especially suitable for large-area-display devices fabricated by 
spin-coating or printing methods. Applying an external electric field on a one-layer 
PLED, electrons are injected from the cathode into the π*-band (lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbital, LUMO) of the EL polymer and the holes are injected from the anode 
to the π-band (highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO). Therefore, energy 
differences between work functions of cathode or anode and LUMO or HOMO of the 
EL polymer, respectively, are the unavoidable energy barrier for electron or hole 
injection. Reducing barrier height of electron injection (between polymer-metal 
interfaces) and balancing charges injection are key points to achieve efficient light 
emission, which is a currently challenged issue. Since most EL conjugated polymers are 
favorable for hole injection (its barrier height is lower than that of electron injection), 
reducing barrier height for electron injection becomes the key to efficient emission. Two 
strategies have been proposed to attain the reduction:106 use low work function metals as 
cathode107, 108 or insert electron injection/transporting materials between emitting layer 
and cathode. However, low work-function metals are usually reactive and unstable upon 
exposure to air that makes device encapsulation a necessity. Accordingly, employing 
electron injection or transporting materials is a more practical option instead. For 
example, polymers containing polar substituents or polyelectrolytes were inserted 
between emitting layer and cathode to act as electron transporting or injection 
layer.109-114 Cao et al. synthesized a quaternary ammonium-containing polyfluorene to be 
used as electron injection layer. It enhanced device performance better than using low 
work-function Ba/Al cathode.115 External quantum efficiency of the EL device was 
greater than 2%.  
Polyfluorene (PFs) are widely applied in blue light-emitting material due to its high 
photoluminescence (PL), good chemical and thermal stability, and high quantum 
yield.116, 117 We incorporated orange-emitting chromophores and hyperbranched 
structure into polyfluorene main chain to prepare white-light emitting copolymers118 and 
to reduce its undesirable aggregate formation, respectively.119, 120 Wang et al. designed 
fluorene-based polymers with pendant phosphonate groups; the polymers exhibited 
moderate luminous efficiency (1750 cd/m2, 1.49 cd/A) when applied as an emitting 
layer in PLEDs.121 Traditionally, crown ether is exclusively designed as molecular host 
96 
 
There have been reports on chemical sensors based on conjugated polymers such as 
oligo-phenylenevinylenes,127 poly(p-phenylene vinylene),128 poly[p-(phenylene 
ethylene)-alt-(thienylene ethynylene)] containing oligo-pyridine as receptor,129 and 
water-soluble sodium poly[2-(3-thienyl)ethyloxy-4-butylsulfonate)].130, 131  
We attempted to combine fluorescence sensitivity of polyfluorene and selectivity of 
crown ether moiety to design a new chemosensory and bio-sensory material. For 
applying in EL material, we found that EL performance is significantly improved when 
the crown-containing PFC was used as emitting layer or as electron-injection layer. 
4-2. Experimental Section.  
All synthesized compounds were identified by 1H NMR, FT-IR, and elemental 
analysis (EA). The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-400 MHz 
FT-NMR, and chemical shifts are reported in ppm using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an 
internal standard. The FT-IR spectra were measured as KBr disk on a Fourier transform 
infrared spectrometer, model Valor III from Jasco. The elemental analysis was carried 
out on a Heraus CHN-Rapid elemental analyzer. Absorption and fluorescence spectra 
were obtained using a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-4500 
fluorescence spectrophotometer, respectively. The cyclic voltammograms of polymers 
were measured with a voltammetric apparatus (model CV-50W from BAS) equipped 
with a three-electrode cell. The cell was made up of a polymer-coated glassy carbon as 
the working electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and a platinum 
wire as the auxiliary electrode, immersing in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M 
(n-Bu)4NClO4. The energy levels were calculated using the ferrocene (FOC) value of 
-4.8 eV with respect to vacuum level, which is defined as zero.132 Double-layer 
light-emitting diodes with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Ca/Al were 
fabricated for the investigation of optoelectronic characteristics. The ITO-coated glasses 
were cleaned consecutively in ultrasonic baths of a neutraler reiniger/de-ionized water 
(v/v = 1/3) mixture, de-ionized water, acetone, 2-propanol and UV-O3 cleaner. A thick 
hole-injection layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of the cleaned ITO-coated 
glass and dried at 150 oC for 15 min in a dust-free atmosphere. The emitting layer was 
then spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer from a polymer solution in chlorobenzene 
(20 mg/1 mL, 2000 rpm). The double and triple layer PLED devices were fabricated 
using the same spin rate (2000 rpm). The polymer solutions were filtered through a 
syringe filter (0.2 μm) before the spin-coating. Finally, a thick layer of Ca and Al 
electrodes were consecutively deposited via vacuum evaporation under 2¯10-6 Torr as 
cathode. The luminance-bias, current density-bias, and EL spectral characteristics of the 
devices were recorded using a combination of Keithley power source (model 2400) and 
Ocean Optics usb2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The fabrication of the devices

4-3-2 Chemosensor fluorescence response to metal ion.  
Conjugated polymers have emerged as one of the most important classes of 
transduction materials for chemical sensing systems;126 they transform and amplify a 
chemical signal into an easily measured electrical or optical signal. Fluorescence is a 
widely used sensing signal in chemical sensors and biosensors. This fluorescence 
method offers diverse transduction schemes based on change in intensity, energy transfer, 
wavelength shifting and lifetime decay or flourish. Incorporation of crown ether receptor 
to the conjugated polymer backbone provides the opportunity to obtain changes in 
fluorescence and absorption spectra when different metal ions are presented. Since the 
crown ether groups in PFC are not directly conjugated to backbone, its conformation is 
hardly changed after forming complex with metal ions. Therefore, as shown in Fig.

It is well known that thermal annealing of polyfluorene usually leads to formation 
of inter-chain interaction (excimers) and/or ketone defects.139 And a new green emission 
around 500~600 nm grows in intensity with annealing time if the conditions are 
proper.140-142 Figure 4-11 shows the normalized PL emission spectra of PFC and PF 
films during annealing at 140 ℃  under nitrogen atmosphere. PF shows similar 
red-shifts in absorption and PL spectra after thermal annealing [Figure 4-11(b)]. The 
red-shifts are attributed to aggregate formed under thermal annealing, since aggregate 
possesses stable ground state. In contrast, PFC reveals very different variations in 
absorption and PL spectra after thermal annealing. The absorption spectra remain almost 
unchanged [inset in Figure 4-11(a)], excluding the possibility of aggregate formation. 
But in PL spectra a green-emission appears (peaked at ca. 521 nm) and its intensity 
increases gradually with annealing time. The green emission is negligible for model PF 
under the same annealing condition. Because the annealing is under nitrogen atmosphere, 
formation of ketone due to oxidation can be ruled out. Accordingly, the longer 
wavelength band (500~600 nm) is mainly contributed by the excimer formed under 
photo-excitation. Incorporated crown ether enhances the inter-chain interaction due to its 
polar characteristic that leads to form excimer easily. However, PFC still shows 
outstanding device performance when fabricated as PLED devices and the details will be 
discussed later.

4-3-7. Electroluminescent Properties of LED Devices 
Double-layer electroluminescent devices, with a configuration of 
ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/Ca (50 nm)/Al (100 nm), using PFC and PF as emitting 
materials were fabricated to investigate their optoelectronic characteristics. The PFC 
and PF films were obtained by spin-coating of their chlorobenzene solutions (20 mg/mL) 
onto treated ITO glass. Figure 4-14 shows the normalized EL spectra of PFC and PF 
devices under a bias of 8.7 V. For PF device, three major EL emission peaks locate at 
423, 448 and 479 nm, corresponding to S10→S00, S10→S01 and S10→S02 vibronic 
transitions respectively.143 However, the PFC device shows not only the intrinsic 
emissions of polyfluorene but also an additional intense peak at 522 nm and a shoulder 
at ca. 570 nm. In order to elucidate the origin of these new emissions, the PFC film was 
annealed at 140 ℃ under nitrogen atmosphere to investigate its PL spectral variations. 
As shown in Figure 4-15, a significant PL band appears between 500 nm and 600 nm 
after annealing for 170 min. The annealing-induced emission has been attributed to 
excimer formed. Therefore, the green emission under a bias can be attributed to 
formation of excimer as well.

Intimately compatible interface usually leads to decreased interfacial energy that is 
conducive to electron injection. Cao et al. proposed that insertion of charged or polar 
groups between cathode and emissive layer resulted in a positive interfacial dipole, 
which effectively lowered the work function of metals and led to a lowering of injection 
barrier heights at the interface.114, 145, 146

be 1.1 x 104 and 1.1 x 103 M-1 for Ru3+ and Fe3+, respectively. Moreover, the sensory 
sensitivity toward Ru3+ is very high and the detection limit can be as low as 1 ppm. 
These results suggest that PFC is a promising candidate for possible use as 
chemosensors for Ru3+ and Fe2+. In film state, the PL spectra of PFC (430 nm and 452 
nm) showed obvious red-shift comparing with poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene) (PF). After 
thermal annealing at 140 ℃ for 70 min, a new intense emission appeared at ca. 520 nm 
which had been ascribed to formation of excimer. The HOMO and LUMO levels of 
PFC were estimated to be -5.68 and -2.65 eV, respectively, resulting in more balanced 
charged injection when compared with those of PF (-5.77 eV, -2.75 eV). The band gaps 
of PFC and PF (3.02 ~ 3.03 eV) were comparable due to the same conjugated backbone. 
The maximum luminance and maximum luminance efficiency of PFC device 
(ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PFC/Ca/Al) were 7910 cd/m2 and 2.3 cd/A respectively, which was 
superior to those of PF device (860 cd/m2, 0.29 cd/A). The PFC was also confirmed as 
effective in promoting electron injection. The maximum luminance and maximum 
luminance efficiency of the triple-layer device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PF/PFC/Ca/Al) 
reached 2800 cd/m2 and 0.53 cd/A, respectively. Current results indicate that pendant 
crown ether groups in polyfluorene are effective in enhancing electron injection and 
device performance.

has now become an emergency for the sake of environment protection and human 
health.  
Interest in chemosensors is mainly attributed to their ability to produce signal gain 
in response to interactions with analytes. The study has been focused on design and 
synthesis of chemosensors for ions and neutral molecules in recent years.50, 149, 150 A 
chemosensor mainly comprises a recognition moiety and a signal transducer group, 
which is not wide apart from each other. The signal transducer can be linked to the 
acceptor unit via a spacer or not. In the design of such sensors, attention should be paid 
to both recognition and signal moieties. The signal transducer converts the information 
(recognition event) into an optical signal expressed as the changes in the photophysical 
characteristics of the fluorophore. The recognition moiety is responsible for the 
selectivity and efficiency of binding which depend on the ligand, on the characteristics 
of the cation (ionic radius, charge, coordination number, hardness, etc.), and on the 
nature of the solvent (and also pH and ionic strength in the case of aqueous solutions).46 
For chemical sensors, recognition moiety plays a dominant role in selectivity. The 
recognition moiety can be cryptand-based group,151 podand-based group,152 or crown 
ether-based group.43 In this work, we chose crown ether to be an acceptor, which showed 
unique selectivity and sensitivity toward specific metal ions. 
Crown ether was discovered in the early 1960s by Charles Pedersen at Du Pont 
Company.153 They are designed as molecular hosts to complex with alkali and alkaline 
earth cations, transition metal and ammonium cations. There are numerous reports in the 
literature that used crown ether as sensors for metal ions or small molecules.43 The 
crown ethers have oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms, which when coupled with the 
diameter of cavity, allow for selective complexation of a wide range of metal ions. The 
ability of crown ether-metal ion complexation depends on the number of ether donor 
atoms and conformation of the receptor. The most important factor is the relative size 
between the receptor cavity and the cation; however, conformation of the receptor may 
influence cavity size. When the ion is able to fit within the cavity, the crown ether and 
metal ion is formed in a 1:1 ratio.154, 155 For larger metal ions which cannot be 
accommodated by the crown ether due to its limited cavity size, the affinity between 
them is significantly reduced. In this case, there is a tendency for the metal ions being 
sandwiched between adjacent crown ether units.156, 157 
Recently, the  phenomenon  of  dual  fluorescence  emission  of electron 
donor (D)-spacer-electron acceptor (A) integrated systems has attracted considerable 
attention,47, 48 because interplay  of  the  two  emissive states with environment is 
not only informative on excited-state D-A interactions but also useful in fluorescence 
sensory applications. When a fluorophore contains an electron donating group (often an 
amino group) conjugated to an electron acceptor (electron-withdrawing group), it shows

mixing 9 mL of the metal ion solution and 1 mL of the CN-azacrown. (or H-azacrown.) 
solution. A set of titration  solutions of Li+ (5×10-6 M, 2×10-5 M, 5×10-5 M, 7×10-5 M, 
1×10-4 M, 2×10-4 M, 5×10-4 M, 7×10-4 M, 1×10-3 M in acetone) was also prepared to 
study the concentration effect of Li+ on sensors’ fluorescence. Fluorescence spectra of 
the sensors’ solutions were measured right after mixing 9 mL of the Li+ solutions with 1 
mL of the CN-azacrown. (or H-azacrown.) solution.  
5-3 Result and Discussion 
5-3-1. Synthesis and characterization of fluorescent crown ethers (CN-azacrown. 
and H-azacrown.) 
The synthetic routes for fluorescent sensors CN-azacrown. and H-azacrown. are 
depicted in Scheme 5-1. The intermediates were satisfactorily characterized by 1H NMR 
spectra, FT-IR spectra and elemental analysis. CN-azacrown. was successfully 
synthesized from compound 8 and (4-bromophenyl)acetonitrile by the Knoevenagel 
reaction using potassium tert-butoxide as the catalyst. H-azacrown. was prepared from 
compounds 8 and (4-bromophenyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (9) by the Wittig 
reaction using sodium ethoxide as the catalyst. FT-IR spectra of both H-azacrown. and 
CN-azacrown. demonstrate absorption around 1120 cm-1 assigned to asymmetric 
stretching of the C-O-C group in crown ether moiety. Furthermore, FT-IR spectrum of 
CN-azacrown. shows obvious peaks at 2199 and 2360 cm-1, indicating successful 
incorporation of cyano-group. The 1H NMR resonance peaks at 3.56-3.80 ppm and 
3.60-3.78 ppm are attributed to protons in crown ether moiety of CN-azacrown. and 
H-azacrown., respectively. Both CN-azacrown. and H-azacrown. are soluble in 
common organic solvents such as chloroform and toluene, even in high polar solvents 
such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and pyridine due to polar nature of the crown 
ether groups.

quenching of CN-azacrown. is still detectable when Li+ concentration is as low as 1 
ppm, indicating very high sensitivity of the sensor. To summarize, the CN-azacrown. 
sensor exhibits not only high selectivity toward Li+ but also with excellent sensitivity, 
among the metal ions investigated. Moreover, CN-azacrown. shows better selectivity 
(quenched by Li+ only) and sensitivity (Ksv = 6.39×104 M-1) than H-azacrown. 
(quenched by Li+ and Fe3+, Ksv = 6.13×103 M-1 toward Li+). When expressed as stability 
constants (logKS) the values are 6.1 and 4.5 for CN-azacrown. and H-azacrown., 
respectively. This enhanced sensitivity in CN-azacrown. can be reasonably attributed to 
an extra electron-withdrawing cyano group which promotes the intramolecular charge 
transfer (ICT) process. The recognition sensitivity of CN-azacrown. to Li+ has been 
improved significantly when compared to those reported previously for similar 
structures.47, 48, 100, 159, 160

Multi-functional Hyperbranched Oligo(fluorene 
vinylene) Containing Pendant Crown Ether: Synthesis, 
Chemosensory and Electroluminescent Properties 
 
Multi-functional hyperbranched oligo(fluorene vinylene) (HOFC) containing 
pendant crown ether was synthesized from 2,4,7-trivinyl-9,9-dihexylfluorene and 
2,7-dibromo-9-(15-crown-4)-9H-fluorene via Heck coupling reaction. Their 
chemosensory, photo-physical and electrochemical properties were investigated and 
compared with those of linear oligo(fluorene vinylene) (LOFC) to elucidate the effect of 
hyperbranched structure. Both HOFC and LOFC exhibit selective fluorescence 
quenching toward Fe3+ and Ru3+, with the Stern-Volmer coefficients (Ksv) to Ru3+ being 
2×104 and 1.9×104 M-1, respectively. The stability constant (Ks) of forming complex with 
Ru3+ are 3.1×103 and 5×103 M-1 for HOFC and LOFC. Moreover, hyperbranched 
HOFC reveals homogeneous film morphology due to its hyperbranched structure. After 
thermal treatment, the cured polymer (HFC) shows better thermal stability because of 
higher cross-linked density. Double-layer electroluminescent devices 
(ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HFC or LFC/Ca/Al), using thermally cross-linked HFC or LFC as 
emitting layer, were fabricated to investigate their optoelectronic properties. The turn-on 
voltage, maximum luminance and maximum luminance efficiency of HFC device (4.1 V, 
7130 cd/m2 and 1.3 cd/A) are superior to those of LFC device (6.2 V, 330 cd/m2, 0.22 
cd/A), which have been attributed to its homogeneous film morphology. Current results 
indicate that the hyperbranched oligo(fluorene vinylene) is a promising material for 
chemosensors and electroluminescent devices.

6-1. Introduction  
Conjugated polymers have attracted considerable attention among scientists due to 
their potential applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs),18, 168 chemical sensors,169, 170  
130 
 
and a signal transducer group. The signal transducer converts the information, caused by 
the interaction between recognition moiety and analyte, into an optical signal and is 
expressed as changes in photo-physical characteristics of the fluorophore. Comparing to 
small molecules, conjugated polymers is able to produce signal gain in response to 
interactions with analytes, resulting in the amplification of fluorescent signals.200 Due to 
their high sensitivity and ease of measurement, conjugated polymers have serviced as 
major stream in next generation. Moreover, introducing a recognition moiety into 
polyfluorene can result in a promising multi-functionalized conjugated polymer, in 
which can be applied in both of chemical sensor and PLED emitter. 
In this article, we synthesized a new trivinylfluorene (3) as branching monomer and 
copolymerized it with crown ether-containing fluorene (5) via Heck coupling reaction to 
give a multi-functionalized conjugated hyperbranched oligomer. The oligomer shows 
high selective response toward specific metal cations (Fe3+, Ru3+) and thermally 
cross-linkable character. The latter was examined by differential scanning calorimeter 
(DSC) to evaluate their curing behaviors. After thermal curing, the hyperbranched 
polymer demonstrated homogeneous film, good solvent resistance and high thermal 
stability. Moreover, its electroluminescent performance is also superior to those of linear 
counterpart. 
6-2. Experimental Section  
Double-layer light-emitting diodes with a configuration of 
ITO/PEDOT:PSS/cross-linked polymer/Ca/Al were fabricated to investigate their 
optoelectronic characteristics. The ITO-coated glasses were washed successively in 
ultrasonic baths of neutraler reiniger/de-ionized water (1:3 v/v) mixture, de-ionized 
water, acetone, and 2-propanol, followed with cleaning in a UV-O3 chamber. A thick 
hole-injection layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on top of the cleaned ITO glass and 
annealed at 150 oC for 15 min in a dust-free atmosphere. Upon the hole injecting 
PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated with an emitting layer from an oligomer solution in 
chlorobenzene (20 mg/ml, 2000 rpm) and heated at 180 °C for 1 h under nitrogen 
atmosphere. The oligomer solutions were filtered through a syringe filter (0.2 μm) 
before the spin-coating. Finally, a thick layer of Ca and Al were successively deposited 
as cathode via vacuum deposition under 1¯10-6 Torr. The luminance-bias, current 
density-bias, and EL spectral characteristics of the devices were recorded using a 
combination of Keithley power source (model 2400) and Ocean Optics usb2000 
fluorescence spectrophotometer. The fabrication of the devices was done in ambient 
conditions, with the following performance tests conducted in a glove-box filled with 
nitrogen.

6-3-2. Thermal Curing and Morphology Study.  
Both terminal vinyl and internal vinylene groups are reactive when subject to 
thermal treatment although the reactivity of the latter is much lower than the former. 
Thermal cross-linking of the terminal vinyl groups leads to improved thermal stability. 
Comparing with linear counterpart (LOFC), hyperbranched HOFC owns more 
peripheral reactive groups which readily form as three-dimensional structure after 
thermal curing. This definitely reduces inter-chain interaction and leads to high thermal 
stability. Thermal curing behaviors of oligomers HOFC and LOFC were investigated 
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as shown in Figure 6-1. During the first

respectively). 
Figure 6-5 shows the absorption and PL spectra of oligomers (HOFC, LOFC) and 
their cross-linked polymers (HFC, LFC) obtained by curing at 180 °C for 1 h under 
nitrogen atmosphere. Thermal treatment of polymer film possibly leads to formation of 
aggregate or excimer which cause shift in emission peak or change in spectral feature. 
This leads to change in emission color, especially when the applying temperature is 
higher than the glass-transition temperature of the polymer. After the thermal treatment,

backbone). The resulting polymers (HOFC, LOFC) are multi-functional material 
consisting of conjugated backbone and pendant crown ether as recognition moiety. 
Therefore, they can be applied either as a chemical sensor for cations or as emitting 
material for electroluminescent devices. Fluorescence is a widely used sensing signal in 
chemical sensors and biosensors, i.e., it offers diverse transduction schemes based on 
change in intensity, energy transfer, wavelength shifting and lifetime decay. Figure 6-6 
shows the PL spectra of oligomer HOFC in the presence of various cations. The PL 
intensity is decreased significantly in present of Fe3+ and Ru3+, suggesting its high 
selectivity to these two cations. Linear oligomer LOFC also demonstrates identical 
selective response to Fe3+ and Ru3+ due to having the same crown ether as recognition 
moiety. The chelating capability of crown ether depends on the match of its cavity size 
and the diameter of the metal ions. The selectivity response is governed by the 
complement of cavity size of crown ether and diameter of metal ions. The diameters of 
Fe3+ and Ru3+ (Fe3+: 1.34 Å; Ru3+: 1.24 Å) are more fitted to the cavity size of the 
pendant crown ether. In addition they are both trivalent ions which will bind with the 
crown ether to form more a stable complex than univalent and divalent ions. The PL 
quenching is probably caused by the crown ether-bound metal ions, to which the 
photo-excited energy of main chain is transferred. The energy transfer is highly probable 
due to the proximity between bound ions and main chain. The Stern-Volmer relationship 
allows us to investigate the kinetic of a photo-physical intermolecular deactivation 
process. As shown in Figure 6-7, the PL intensity is decreased with an increase in 
concentration of Ru3+ cation. The Stern-Volmer plot for Ru3+ shows upward curvature, 
suggesting that the quenching is attributed to the sphere-of-action mechanism.203-205 The 
Stern-Volmer constants (Ksv) of HOFC and LOFC toward Ru3+, estimated at low 
quencher concentration (below 1.38×10-4 M), are 2×104 and 1.9×104 M-1, respectively. 
The stability constant (Ks) of forming complex with Ru3+ are 3.1×103 and 5×103 M-1  
for HOFC and LOFC, respectively. These results indicate that the HOFC and LOFC 
containing pendant crown ether are promising chemical sensor for metal cations. In 
recent researches, hyperbranched conjugated polymers showed better sensing efficiency 
than linear counterparts.52, 200, 206 It has been attributed to that hyperbranched conjugated 
polymers provide greater number of possible exciton migration pathways through the 
join of branch unit, which increases the probability of exciton quenched by analyte. 
However, the branching at 4-position of HOFC leads to a 41.6o twist angle between the 
two fluorene units as shown in its optimized geometry as shown in Figure 6-8 in which 
was obtained by semi-empirical MNDO calculation. This twist is unfavorable to the 
migration of excitons through the branch unit.  Accordingly, the sensing properties of 
HOFC and LOFC are comparable.

6-3-4. Electrochemical Properties.  
Cyclic voltammetry has been applied and considered as an effective tool to 
investigate electrochemical properties of conjugated polymers. HOFC- or LOFC-coated 
glassy carbon was used as working electrode and immersed in anhydrous acetonitrile 
containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) as electrolyte. Figure 
6-9 demonstrates the cyclic voltammograms of HOFC and LOFC films. Two oxidation 
peaks of LOFC at 1.24 V and 2.14 V are probably attributed to the formation of radical 
cation and dication, respectively. However, only one broad peak at about 1.6 V is 
observed in HOFC. This phenomenon has been attributed to electronic interaction 
between branches upon oxidation, which is not electronically isolated.207 The onset 
oxidation potentials of HOFC and LOFC are observed at 1.03 V and 1.02 V, 
respectively. And the reduction potentials are situated at -1.77 V and -1.8 V (Table 6-3). 
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO) levels are estimated by using the equations EHOMO = -(Eox + 4.8) eV and 
ELUMO = -(Ered + 4.8) eV, where Eox and Ered are the onset reduction and oxidation 
potentials relative to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. The HOMO and LUMO energy 
levels of HOFC are -5.35 and -2.55 eV, respectively, and those of LOFC are -5.34 and

(475 nm and 502 nm for LFC device) which are similar to their corresponding PL 
spectra in film state. The turn-on voltage of HFC device (4.1 V) is much lower than that 
of LFC device (6.2 V). Furthermore, the maximum luminance and maximum luminance 
efficiency of HFC device (7132 cd/m2, 1.3 cd/A) are superior to those of LFC device 
(331 cd/m2, 0.22 cd/A). The EL performance enhancement in HFC device is attributable 
to its improved film morphology after thermal curing as discussed in AFM study. 
Moreover, the maximum luminance and maximum luminance efficiency of HFC device 
are also superior to those of hyperbranched poly(fluorene vinylene) without pendant 
crown ether groups (2180 cd/m2, 0.89 cd/A).208 Accordingly, side crown ether groups 
contribute greatly to the performance enhancement. The compatibility between organic 
emitting layer and cathode (calcium) is promoted in the presence of polar crown ether 
moieties. Intimately compatible interface usually leads to decreased interfacial energy 
that is conducive to electron injection.

undesirable aggregate and excimer which generally deteriorates the performance of 
polymeric light-emitting diode (PLED).210-214 Hyperbranched architecture can be viewed 
as an intermediate architectural state lying between linear polymers and dendrimers. 
There are two different synthetic strategies to obtain hyperbranched polymers: One is 
through self-condensation of ABn-type monomer with n ≧ 2; the other is via 
copolymerization of A2 with Bn comonomers where the n≧3.215-217 Hyperbranched 
polymers possess many advantages over linear counterparts, such as lower intrinsic 
viscosity, improved solubility and reduced intermolecular interaction, which are mainly 
originated from their highly branched and globular molecular structures.218 An additional 
conspicuous advantage of hyperbranched polymers over highly symmetric dendrimers 
lies in facile one-pot synthesis. Moreover, stable and homogeneous amorphous film is 
readily obtainable owing to reduced inter-chain cohesive force.219 This amorphous and 
homogeneous morphology is critical for the fabrication of efficient multilayer 
light-emitting diodes.56, 218-220 Moreover, the terminal functional groups of a 
hyperbranched polymer can be readily changed by controlling the stoichiometry of feed 
monomers. For instance, the terminal of a hyperbranched polymers are reactive vinyl 
groups when prepared by the Heck coupling reaction using an excess of di- or trivinyl 
aromatic monomer.60, 221, 222 Concentration of the terminal vinyl groups is much greater 
than that of linear counterparts due to their hyperbranched structures. High concentration 
of the reactive vinyl groups results in densely cross-linked polymer which usually 
exhibits better solvent resistance and thermal stability than lightly cross-linked one. 
Solvent resistant characteristic is essential in the fabrication of multiple-layer polymeric 
light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), since it will prevent solvent erosion during subsequent 
spin-coating processes. Accordingly, solvent resistance is a prerequisite for 
hole-transporting polymers applied in PLEDs.     
Polymeric light-emitting diodes have been viewed as major next-generation flat 
panel displays due to its low power consumption and large area display via spin-coating 
or inject-printing techniques.18, 185, 223, 224 To obtain high performance PLEDs 
necessitates efficient and balanced charges injection/transport from cathode and anode, 
respectively.225 However, it is very difficult for an electroluminescent material to posses 
both high luminescence and good electron- and hole-transporting ability simultaneously. 
Therefore, multiple-layer EL devices are an alternative to attain efficient EL emission. 
But during the fabrication of a multiple-layer device the deposited layer may be 
dissolved by the subsequent spin-coating solution.226 To avoid this undesirable 
dissolution, cross-linkable precursors become necessary for the device fabrication. The 
soluble precursors should be functionalized with some specific functional groups, such 
as siloxane, norbornene, oxetane, vinyl and trifluorovinyl ether, which are photo or 
thermally polymerizable or cross-linkable to produce insoluble polymer networks.225-228

syringe filter (0.2 μm pore size) before the spin-coating. Finally, a thick layer of Ca and 
Al were successively deposited as cathode via vacuum deposition under 1¯10-6 Torr. 
The luminance-bias, current density-bias, and EL spectral characteristics of the devices 
were recorded using a combination of Keithley power source (model 2400) and Ocean 
Optics usb2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Device fabrication was done in ambient 
conditions, with the following performance tests conducted in a glove-box filled with 
nitrogen. 
7-3. Result and Discussion 
7-3-1. Synthesis and Characterization of Hyperbranched Polymers (HTP and 
HTPOCH3) 
Dibromo monomer TPOCH3 was synthesized from 4-methoxy-N,N-diphenylaniline 
and N-bromosuccinimide, following the procedures reported in literature.239 The 
preparation procedure of branch monomer 2,4,7-trivinyl-9,9-dihexylfluorene (M2) had 
been reported in our previous study (Scheme 1).235 Hyperbranched hole-transporting 
polymers containing triphenylamine (HTP and HTPOCH3) were synthesized via the 
Heck coupling reaction using A2+B3 approach. To increase the amount of reactive vinyl 
groups available for following thermal curing, an excess of monomer M2 was employed 
for the polymerization. However, the polymerization led to final gellation even at this 
stoichiometric imbalance due to the presence of tri-functional monomer M2. In order to 
avoid the cross-linking of the polymers, the polymerization was interrupted before the 
gellation. This early interruption of polymerization gives rise to low polymer yields 
(45-56%). The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of HTP and HTPOCH3, as 
determined by gel permeation chromatography using mono-disperse polystyrene as 
standard, was 1.5×104 and 0.8×104 (Table 7-1), with the polydispersity indexes (PDI) 
being 2.1 and 2.6, respectively. The large PDI values are attributable to growth rate 
difference between larger molecules and small ones. Because the growth rate is 
proportional to functionality, larger molecules grow faster than smaller ones that results 
in broadened molecular weight distribution.240 The resulting polymers (HTP and 
HTPOCH3) are readily soluble in common organic solvent such as chloroform and 
toluene. The 1H NMR spectra of the hyperbranched HTP and HTPOCH3 show the 
peaks located at 0.6~1.3 ppm and 2.0 ppm has been assigned to protons of pendant hexyl 
groups. The characteristic peaks at 5.2~6.0 ppm confirms the existence of periphery 
vinyl groups, from which thermally cross-linkable characteristic can be expected for the 
hyperbranched polymers.

7-3-3. Photophysical Properties of HTP and HTPOCH3 
Table 7-2 summarizes the characteristic optical data of HTP and HTPOCH3 in 
CHCl3 and as thin films spin-coated on quartz plate, with their absorption and PL spectra 
being shown in Figure 7-4. The HTP and HTPOCH3 in CHCl3 show a absorption 
maxima at 418 nm and 423 nm with shoulders at 341 nm and 340 nm, which can be 
attributed to the π-π* transition of the main chain and the n-π* transition of the 
triphenylamine segments, respectively. In film state the absorption peaks red-shift 
slightly to 424 and 431 nm. The PL emission maxima in CHCl3 locate at 478 and 488 
nm for HTP and HTPOCH3 respectively, which shift bathochromically to 483 and 494 
nm in film state. The red-shifts for HTP (5 nm) and HTPOCH3 (6 nm) in going from 
solution to film state are close to those of absorption (6 nm, 8 nm). This suggests that the 
undesirable inter-chain interactions are effectively prevented by the hyperbranched 
structures of the polymers.

Both HTP and HTPOCH3 are thermally cross-linkable polymers which are 
potentially applicable in the fabrication of multilayer PLED devices. However, highly 
solvent-resistant is a prerequisite for multilayer PLEDs fabricated by solution processes. 
To examine the solvent-resistance of the HTP and HTPOCH3 before and after thermal 
curing, a good solvent (chlorobenzene) was spin-coated on the top of the polymer films 
and then their absorption spectral variations were investigates. As shown in Figure 7-5, 
the absorption spectra of the pristine HTP and HTPOCH3 films disappear almost 
completely after chlorobenzene spin-coating, indicating that the films are dissolved out 
during the coating process. However, the absorption spectral intensity of the thermally 
cured HTP and HTPOCH3 remains almost unchanged after the spin-coating. Their high

7-3-4. Electrochemical Properties 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) has been constantly applied and considered as an 
effective tool to investigate electrochemical properties of conjugated polymers. HTP- or 
HTPOCH3-coated ITO glasses were used as the working electrode, immersed in 
anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) 
as electrolyte, to conduct the CV measurements. Characteristic electrochemical data are 
summarized in Table 7-3. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is estimated 
by using the equation EHOMO = -(Eox + 4.8) eV, where Eox is the onset oxidation potential 
relative to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

7-3-5. Optoelectronic Properties of Light-emitting Diodes using HTP and 
HTPOCH3 as Hole-Transporting Layers 
To demonstrate the application of the hyperbranched polymers (HTP and 
HTPOCH3) as hole-transporting layer, multiple-layer PLEDs with a configuration of 
ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTP or HTPOCH3/MEH-PPV/Ca(50 nm)/Al(100 nm) were 
fabricated to investigate their optoelectronic characteristics. The hyperbranched 
polymers were spin-coated on top of ITO glass deposited with PEDOT:PSS, followed by 
thermal treatment at 210 oC for 30 min under nitrogen atmosphere to obtain transparent 
and insoluble films. The device without hole-transporting layer 
(ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MEH-PPV/Ca/Al) was also fabricated simultaneously for 
comparative study. Figure 8-8 shows current density versus bias and luminance versus 
bias relationships of the EL devices, with the characteristic data summarized in Table 
7-4. The main emission peaks are situated around 581 nm and 624 nm for all devices 
(Figure 7-9), mainly contributed from MEH-PPV. Furthermore, the luminance efficiency 
(at 1000 cd/m2) and maximum luminance of MEH-PPV devices with HTP or 
HTPOCH3 as hole-transporting layer devices are superior to those without 
hole-transporting layer. For instance, the maximum luminance (luminance efficiency at 
1000 cd/m2) of the devices are 12610 (0.32 cd/A) and 14060 cd/m2 (0.33 cd/A) 
respectively, while it is 9310 cd/m2 (0.26 cd/A) for that without hole-transporting layer. 
The performance enhancement of the multilayer PLEDs seems contributed by a 
combination of several factors. Firstly, hole transport is facilitated due to high HOMO 
levels of the hyperbranched HTP (-5.17 eV) and HTPOCH3 (-5.07 eV). Secondly, the 
thermally cross-linked HTP or HTPOCH3 acts as a buffer layer not only to smooth 
surface but also to prevent PEDOT:PSS chain from penetrating into the emitting layer to 
quench the emission.225, 242 Finally, the hyperbranched HTP and HTPOCH3 also serve 
as electron-blocking layer, especially the latter, to increase the possibility of 
recombination in emitting layer (MEH-PPV). Consequently, HTPOCH3-based device 
shows higher maximum luminance (14060 cd/m2) than HTP-based one (12610 cd/m2) 
due to its raised LUMO level. Furthermore, the energy levels of the hyperbranched 
polymers can be readily tuned by replacing the triphenylamine moieties with other 
hole-transporting groups. Accordingly, thermally cross-linkable hyperbranched polymers 
containing hole-transporting moieties are promising candidates for the fabrication of 
efficient multilayer PLEDs.

7-4. Summary 
We have successfully synthesized and characterized two hyperbranched polymers 
(HTP and HTPOCH3) containing triphenylamine moieties in main chain and reactive 
vinyl groups in periphery or terminal units. The hyperbranched HTP and HTPOCH3 
were thermally cross-linked to form as transparent films. The exothermic peaks were at 
221 °C and 210 °C for HTP and HTPOCH3, respectively. Their glass-transition 
temperatures (Tg) were as high as 149.6 °C and 141.7 °C after thermal curing at 210 °C 
for 30 min. Moreover, both HTP and HTPOCH3 demonstrated homogeneous film 
morphology after thermal curing, with the root-mean-square (rms) roughness being 0.77 
nm and 0.89 nm. Multilayer light-emitting diodes 
(ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/MEH-PPV/Ca/Al) using HTP or HTPOCH3 as 
hole-transporting layer (HTL) were successfully fabricated by successive spin-coating of 
polymer layers. Their maximum luminance were 12610 and 14060 cd/m2, with 
luminance efficiencies (at 1000 cd/m2) being 0.32 and 0.33 cd/A respectively, surpassing 
the performance of MEH-PPV device without HTL (9310 cd/m2, 0.26 cd/A). Current 
results demonstrate that the thermally cross-linkable hyperbranched polymers are 
promising hole-transporting materials applicable for the fabrication of multilayer PLEDs. 
Furthermore, their hole-transporting ability can be readily adjusted by replacing 
triphenylamine moiety with other hole-transporting groups.

respectively, surpassing the performance of MEH-PPV device without HTL (9310

Combination of conjugated polyfluorene with crown ether gives rise to promising 
multi-functional polymers applicable in electroluminescent and chemosensory areas. 
The crown ether specifically recognizes certain metal ions. The signal produced by the 
binding reaction is amplified by conjugated backbone, leading to high sensitivity 
characteristics. The design concept of introducing electron-withdrawing group (CN) 
can be applied to sketch new conjugated-based chemosensors. The novel branched 
monomer M2 is potential starting materials to synthesize hole-transporting 
hyperbranched polymers. Their hole-transporting ability can be readily adjusted by 
replacing triphenylamine moiety with other hole-transporting groups.
