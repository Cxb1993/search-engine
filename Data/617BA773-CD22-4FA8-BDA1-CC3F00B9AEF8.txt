1. INTRODUCTION
Heat transport in nanoscale heat conduction is predominantly by phonons,
which are quanta of crystal vibration energy. Transient heat transport by phonons is of
vital importance in several technological applications. For instance, microelectronics
devices are composed mainly of thin films of semiconductors such as Si or GaAs, of
dielectrics such as SiO2 and Si3N4, and of metals. The conventional approaches such
as Fourier’s law and hyperbolic heat equation to heat conduction problems break 
down if the analyzing transient heat transport is in the ballistic regime.
Thermal conductivity is one of the hardest transport coefficients to calculate in
microscale or nanoscale heat conduction (Evans and Morriss, [1]). The most widely
used model for determining the thermal conductivity is a method first proposed by
Callaway [2] which assumes that the N-processes dominate the scattering and the total
thermal conductivity can be expressed as a function of the combined relaxation time.
Holland [3] was the first to modify the form of Calaway’s model, it was known as
Holand’s model. Again the thermal conductivity is given as a function of relaxation 
time.
To date, several groups, such as Che et al. [4]; Chen [5]; Goodson et al. [6];
5surface heat fluxes for a three-dimensional inverse heat convection problem. Huang
and Chin [16] used CGM in a two-dimensional inverse problem of imaging the
thermal conductivity of a non-homogeneous medium. Huang [17] applied the CGM in
a non-linear inverse vibration problem in estimating the unknown external forces for a
system with displacement-dependent parameters. Huang and Lo [18] applied the
CGM in the inverse problems in estimating the unknown boundary heat fluxes for the
cutting tools.
In dealing with the integro-differential governing equations as were considered
here, some special treatment is needed. To obtain the adjoint equation, Kim and
Daniel [19] suggested that an extra integration with respect to angular variable is
needed in the objective function for the original integro-differential governing
equations. Finally, a compact form of the adjoint equations can be obtained.
Alifanov et al [13] defined that CGM may also be called the Iterative
Regularization Method (IRM). This is because the CGM together with the
regularizing discrepancy principal as a sopping criterion for linear inverse problems
give a regularization method in the Tikhonov sense where the last iteration index is
the regularization parameter, which means the regularization procedure is performed
during the iterative processes and thus the determination of optimal regularization
conditions is not needed. The CGM derives from the perturbation principles and
transforms the inverse problem to the solution of three problems, namely, the direct,
the direct problem in variations and the adjoint problem, which will be discussed in
detail in the next few sections.
2. THE DIRECT PROBLEM
The motivation of the present inverse phonon radiative transport problem is to
estimate the frequency and temperature dependent relaxation time for a nanoscale thin
film; thereafter the actual thermal performance as well as the thermal conductivity of
the thin film can be obtained. Figure 1 shows the geometry and coordinates for the
thin film domain considered here and the schematic diagram of phonon-mediated heat
conduction analysis is also illustrated.

The solution for the above phonon radiative transport problem is solved using
explicit upstream differencing method, i.e. using backward differencing in space in
Equation (3a) when the wave is traveling in the positive x direction and using forward
differencing in space in Equation (3b) when it is traveling in the negative x direction.
The direct problem considered here is concerned with the determination of the phonon
intensity of the medium when all the boundary conditions at all boundaries and
relaxation time are known.
3. THE INVERSE PROBLEM
For the inverse problem, the initial temperature T0(,0) and the boundary
temperatures T1(0,) at= 0 and T2(1,) at= 1 in equation (2) are known. However
the dimensionless parameter(,T), which is related to the relaxation timeR(,T), is
regarded as being unknown.
It would be a difficult task if(,T) is to be estimated as a function ofand T.
This is because that the measurements inside the film are needed since different
positions will result in different temperatures and thus different relaxation time. If the
boundary temperatures at = 0 and 1 are chosen as close as possible, the resultant
temperature distributions within the film are nearly identical and thus the relaxation
time becomes only function of frequency under the given temperature condition,
i.e.= (). To find the relaxation time at different temperatures, the procedure can
be repeated with different controlled boundary temperatures and finally the
temperature and frequency dependent relaxation time can be obtained.
In summary, there are two steps in determining (,T): (Step 1). The boundary
temperatures at = 0 and 1 are controlled as close as possible such that () can be
determined under the prescribed temperature, and (Step 2). By varying the prescribed
boundary temperatures, (,T) at those different temperatures can also be estimated.
9on the above statements the intensity measurements, instead of temperature
measurements, are adopted in the present study.
The techniques of phonon measurement is quite new and can be found, but not
many, in literatures [23 -25]. It is presumed that such techniques can be applied to the
present study to measure the phonon intensity.
It should also be noted that when a low frequency is chosen, the inverse solution
must become poor. This is because when the frequency is too low, the vibration of the
phonons becomes very weak and therefore the phonon intensity will also become low.
As a result the measured phonon intensity is very low and this makes it difficult to
obtain an accurate inverse solution for the estimated relaxation time. For this reason
the frequency domain can not be started from zero, it should be started fromL.
The solution of the present inverse problem is to be obtained in such a way that
the following functional is minimized:

               (6)
here  0I , ,1,   are the estimated or computed phonon intensity at = 0, = 1
and time , f is the final time. These quantities are determined from the solution of
the direct problem given previously by using estimated relaxation time for the exact
().
4. CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD FOR MINIMIZATION
The following iterative process based on the conjugate gradient method [13] is
used for the estimation of unknown relaxation timeby minimizing the functional
J[]
n 1 n n n( ) ( ) P ( )    for n = 0,1,2,........ (7a)
wheren is the search step size in going from iteration n to iteration n+1, and Pn()
is the direction of descent (i.e. search direction) given by
n ' n n n 1P ( ) J ( ) P ( )   (7b)
11
The technique of explicit upstream differencing method suggested by Joshi and
Majumdar [16] is used to solve the above variational problems.
The functional n 1J( ) for iteration n+1 is obtained by rewriting equation (6) as
f D

where n 1 is replaced by the expression given in equation (7a). If
+ n n n
0I ( , ,1, ; P )    is linearized by a Taylor’s expansion, equation (10a) takes
the form

The variation functions + n0I ( , ,1, ;P )    are taken as the solutions of problem
(8) at the measured position= 1 and timeby letting nP . The search step size

4-2. ADJOINT PROBLEMS AND GRADIENT EQUATION
Difficulty arises if the conventional procedure in obtaining the adjoint problems
is used to handle the present phonon radiative transport integro-differential equation.
By following the technique applied in [19], an extra integration with respect to
angular variable is needed in the objective function for the original integro-differential
governing equations.
To obtain the adjoint problem, equations (3a) and (3b) are multiplied by the
Lagrange multipliers (or adjoint functions)  and  and the resulting expressions
are integrated over the correspondent domains. It should be noted that an additional
integration with respect tois considered in accordance with [19]. The result is then
13
The adjoint problems are different from the standard initial value problems in
that the final time conditions at time=f is specified instead of the customary initial
condition. Moreover, the boundary conditions are also different from the direct
problems and the direct problem in variations since the known boundary conditions
for + and  are given at= 1 and 0, respectively.
These problems can be transformed into a similar type of integro-differential
equations, like the direct problems and the direct problem in variations, by the
transformation of the time and space variables as=f–and= 1–, respectively.
The solution algorithm applied in the direct problems and the direct problem in
variations can therefore be used for the above adjoint problems in determining the
adjoint functions + and  .
Finally, the following integral term is left

4-3. STOPPING CRITERION
If the problem contains no measurement errors, the traditional check condition
is specified as
J [ ( )]  (18a)
where is a small-specified number. However, the measurement data must contain
measurement errors. Therefore, we do not expect the functional equation (6) to be
equal to zero at the final iteration step. Following the experiences of the authors [15-
15
Step 8. Compute the search step sizen from equation (11).
Step 9. Compute the new estimation for n+1 from equation (7a) and return to
step 2.
Step 10.(,T) is transformed back toR(,T) in accordance with Equation (2c).
Change the boundary temperatures T1(0) and T2(1) and go to step 1.
6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The objective of this article is to show the validity of CGM in estimating the
accurate relaxation time for a nanoscale conduction problem with no prior information
on the functional form of the unknown quantities. The accuracy of the numerical
solution for the direct problem has been examined by Huang and Chen [22].
To illustrate the accuracy of the present inverse algorithm in predicting the
temperature and frequency dependent relaxation time using CGM and the transient
phonon intensity recordings, two specific materials, diamond and GaAs, having
different form of relaxation time are considered here.
In order to compare the results for situation involving random measurement
errors, a normally distributed uncorrelated error with zero mean and constant standard
deviation are considered. The simulated inexact measurement data Y can be expressed
as
+Y =
+
,exactY + (19)
where +,exactY is the solution of the direct problem with an exact relaxation time
(,T); is the standard deviation of the measurements; and is a random variable
that generated by subroutine DRNNOR of the IMSL [20] and will be within -2.576 to
2.576 for a 99% confidence bound.
One of the advantages of using CGM to solve the inverse problems is that the
initial guesses of the unknown quantities can be chosen arbitrarily. In all the test cases
considered here the initial guesses of (,T) is taken as zero, i.e. 0 ( ,T) = 0.0  .
Once the relaxation time is estimated, it can be used to determine the thermal
conductivity of the materials. Two numerical test cases are presented below in
determining(,T) or R(,T) by the inverse analysis using CGM.
17
using only the direction having the largest phonon intensity, the unknown relaxation
time can be determined. This will make the experimental set up easier and this is the
advantage of using CGM.
Based on the observations for numerical solutions of phonon intensity
 Y , , ,  at = 1and = always has the largest intensity among all other
different positions and angles. For this reason it is intended to choose the
measurement position and angle for phonon intensity at= 1 and0 = 1.
The inverse analysis is first performed by assuming exact measurements, =
0.0 and using T1(0,) = 250.1 K and T0(,0) = T2(1,) = 250 K. By using 15 iterations
the solution can be obtained. It should be noted that, in the inverse calculations,(,T)
is the unknown function and is to be estimated. Once (,T) is estimated, it is
transformed back toR(,T) by using Equation (2c). Based on the estimated relaxation
time, it is found that the estimation near zero frequency region is not accurate since
the phonon intensity is very low there. For this reason the estimation is started from
higher frequencyL, i.e. the first three intervals of the frequency are discarded and the
fourth frequency isL.
The average relative error of the exact and estimated relaxation time at 250 K is
calculated as ERR1 % = 5.942E-2%. The definition for average relative error for
ERR1 is given as

(21)
Here i represents the index of discreted frequency and R iˆ ( )  indicates the
estimated relaxation time. The average relative error between the measured and
estimated phonon intensity at 250 K is calculated as ERR2 = 2.088E-7%, where the
definition for average relative errors between the measured and estimated phonon
intensity is given as

other inverse problems. For this reason the iterative process is terminated at the 15
iterations.
The exact and estimated relaxation time with frequency at 250 and 350 K are
shown in Figure 5(a) for the case of 10= 10 and the measured and estimated
phonon intensity distributions at 250 and 350 K are shown in Figure 5(b). The relative
average errors in Figure 5(a) are calculated as ERR1 = 3.095% and 2.105%,
respectively, and in Figure 5(b) are as ERR2 = 1.332E-5% and 4.151E-6%,
respectively.
For the situation with 10= 3 10  , the exact and estimated relaxation time
with frequency at 250 and 320 K are shown in Figure 6(a) and the relative average
errors are calculated as ERR1 = 7.789% and 2.574%, respectively. The measured and
estimated phonon intensity distributions at 250 and 350 K are shown in Figure 6(b)
and the relative average errors are obtained as ERR2 = 3.724E-5% and 1.038E-5%,
respectively.
The estimated relaxation times with different errors show an obvious
difference (Figures 5a and 6a) even thought the measured phonons for different errors
look exactly the same! This implies that such a small error could result in such a large
error in the estimation of the relaxation times.
It should be noticed that the problem is in a nanoscale domain and this may be
the reason why such a small error can result in a large estimated error. It is not
because of the algorithm itself, but the nature of the present phonon radiative transfer
problem, since the CGM has proven its validation for many engineering inverse
problems.
It can be seen from Figures 5 and 6 that the residual between the measured
and estimated phonon intensity is very small for 10= 10 and 10= 3 10  ,
however the estimations near the region of low frequency and low temperature are
always worse than in the region of high frequency and high temperature. The results
also reveal that the present inverse algorithm is very accurate for the case exact
21
back to R(,T) by using Equation (2c) right after its estimation. Again, according to
the inverse solution it is found that the estimation is not accurate near low frequency
region for the reason that the phonon intensity is very low there. The estimation is
thus started from higher frequency, i.e. the first three intervals of the frequency are
discarded.
The average relative error of the exact and estimated relaxation time at 250 K
is calculated as ERR1 % = 1.049%, and the average relative error between the
measured and estimated phonon intensity is calculated as ERR2 = 1.597E-4%. When
the relaxation time at 250 K is estimated, the inverse calculation is then continued by
using 260 K, 270 K and up to 330 K with a step of 10 K.
The estimated R(,T) by using the present inverse algorithm is shown in
Figure 6(b). It is clear from Figures 7(a) and 7(b) that the estimated R(,T) by
utilizing CGM is very accurate, since the calculated relative errors between the exact
and estimated relaxation time are all small and they are listed in Table 2. Moreover,
the measured and estimated phonon intensity is shown in Figures 8(a) and 8(b),
respectively, and they are in a very good agreement. The differences between the
exact and estimated relaxation times are plotted in Figure 9, again in the region of low
frequency, a larger error exists. The relative errors are also listed in Table 2.
The influence of the measurement errors on the inverse solutions is then
examined. First, the measurement error for the phonon intensity measured by sensor is
assumed as 9= 10 , then error is increased to 9= 3 10  . The stopping criterion
can be calculated from equation (18c). Again this stopping criterion can not be used
since the iterative process can not converge to such a small number, instead, 15
number of iteration is used to stop the iteration.
The exact and estimated relaxation time with frequency at 250 and 330 K are
shown in Figure 10(a) for the case of 9= 10 and the measured and estimated
phonon intensity distributions at 250 and 350 K are shown in Figure 10(b). The
relative average errors in Figure 10(a) are calculated as ERR1 = 0.953% and 1.832%,

與會心得報告 
 
每年舉辦一次之亞洲計算熱傳與流力會議 ASCHT’2009， 全名
為 Asian Symposium on Computational Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow，均
為世界上所有研究熱傳與流力相關之學者專家所熱心、積極參與的一
個重要會議。今年在韓國之濟洲島(Jeju)於 2009 年 10 月 20 日至 10
月 23 日舉行。 
本人於 10 月 19 日由桃園出發，直飛濟洲島，全程約 1 個多小時。
本人於 10 月 19 日晚上抵達旅館，稍作休息即往會場辦理報到。 
隔天 10 月 20 日開始整個會議的行程，第一場受邀做專題演講的
為 Prof. Nahmkeon Hur,，講題為” Recent advances in numerical 
simulation of heat and fluid flow in complex heat exchangers”，內容精彩
與會人員皆印象深刻，接下來共分七個場次同時進行。 
本人被分在10月21日下午之場次的第四位演講者，題目為最近新
完成的論文  “A Three-Dimensional Shape Identification Problem in 
Estimating the Unknown Interfacial Surface for a Multiple Region 
Domain“ ，現場之聽眾對本題目極感興趣，在報告完畢後提出了一
些問題互相交換意見，可謂彼此互益良多。 
10 月 23 日上午為最後一天之議程，由於許多人已提前離開，又
僅有半天，因此參加人數不多，下午即舉行閉幕典禮，結束四天之議
