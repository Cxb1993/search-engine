n-dimensional space. The roots for the original alge-
braic equations are obtained by applying numerical 
integrations on the resulting ordinary differential equa-
tion, which do not require information on the deriva-
tion of nonlinear algebraic equations and their inverse. 
Furthermore, regarding BVPs, Liu (2008a) and Liu 
(2009) demonstrated the use of the FTIM for solving 
m-point boundary value problems and two-dimensional 
quasilinear elliptic BVPs. Several numerical examples, 
including the Laplace, Poisson, reaction diffusion, 
Helmholtz, the minimal surface, and explosion equa-
tions, were tested. It is shown that the FTIM can easily 
deal with nonlinear boundary value problems with high 
accuracy. 
In order to develop a construction of a space-time 
manifold and at the same time to maintain the proper-
ties of a Newton-like method, Liu et al. (2009) pro-
posed a scalar-based homotopy method that does not 
calculate the inverse of the Jacobian matrix to solve a 
system of nonlinear algorithm equations (NAEs). 
However, the convergence of this scalar-based ho-
motopy method is very slow; that is, it is difficult to 
satisfy tough convergence criterion. Hence, Kuo et al. 
(2009), Kuo et al. (2010b), and Kuo et al. (2010a) pro-
posed a scalar homotopy method with the incorporation 
of a MBECA; this is basically a scalar New-
ton-homotopy method combined with FTIM and a 
time-like function, which is used to solve NAEs. The 
MBECA is based on the construction of a space-time 
manifold by transforming a vector function into a 
time-dependent scalar function that employs a fictitious 
time variable. It uses the concept of plastic flow rate to 
force the trajectory of unknown vector onto the mani-
fold by assuming that the direction of the plastic flow 
rate of the unknown vector is in the gradient direction. 
The MBECA has the same important features as the 
FTIM with respect to the ability to solve a large class 
of problems effectively and an exponentially conver-
gent property. Although the MBECA and FTIM have 
many advantages, both the viscosity-damping and 
time-like function parameters must be determined. 
When these parameters are determined to be larger than 
some fixed finite value, numerical instability will occur, 
varying with time integrate. Hence, this report employs 
the group-preserving scheme (GPS) proposed by Liu 
(2001) to preserve the space-time manifold of the 
MBECA and to determine both the viscosity-damping 
and time-like function parameters. There are three 
kinds of properties in GPS, namely, cone construction, 
Lie algebra, and group properties. According to the 
plastic concept, the properties of the MBECA must 
satisfy the GPS cone condition. This means that the 
yielding surface under plastic theory must be kept on 
the surface of the cone such that the plastic flow is 
constrained according to the time integration path of 
the cone. 
The outline of this report is as follows. Section 2 
describes the mathematical formulation of the BVPs 
and introduces the numerical procedure of the novel 
finite difference method, manifold-based exponentially 
convergent algorithm (MBECA), and GPS. Then, in 
Section 3, we demonstrate six numerical examples, 
including both linear and nonlinear problems, to com-
pare our method with the original MBECA. Finally, in 
Section 4, we summarize the conclusions. 
 
3. The basic formulation 
3.1 The novel finite difference method(NFDM) 
In this report, elliptic-type BVPs are solved using 
FDM. The following quasilinear elliptic equation is 
considered: 
 ( , ) ( , , , , ),   , ,x yu x y P x y u u x y    (1) 
       , , , ,   , ,D N nu x y u x y H x y x y     (2) 
where D and N are coefficients,  is the Laplacian 
operator, is the boundary of the problem domain , 
and P and H are given functions. Here, the boundary 
 in polar coordinates can be described by a radius 
function with   ( , ) | ( ), 0,2 .r r        To 
conveniently deal with an arbitrary computational do-
main using the FDM, we introduce a fictitious equidis-
tant rectangle to enclose the problem domain . Figure 
1 illustrates the arbitrary problem domain. Suppose that 
the rectangle is given by    0 0 0 0: , ,a a b b     such 
that 0a and 0b can cover the maximum length of the 
problem domain along the x-axis and y-axis, respec-
tively. Then we divide the rectangle by a uniform 
grid, with 02 / ( 1)x a m   and 02 / ( 1)y b m   in the 
x-direction and y-direction, respectively. At the same 
time, we let , ( ) ( , , )i j i ju t u x y t be a numerical value of 
u at the grid point ( , )i jx y  , which varies with time t, 
where ( 1)ix i x   and ( 1)iy i y   .

Although an equidistant finite difference scheme can 
easily handle a governing equation, it is hard to match 
the boundary condition in (2) exactly. Usually, one uses 
an adaptive grid method to locate the circumferential 
grid points on the boundary. However, this may com-
plicate numerical computation on an arbitrary plane.  
Because the boundary condition is given on the contour 
 , not on the boundary of the rectangle , we must 
derive the governing equation of ,i ju at the nodal points 
on the rectangular boundary. 
To overcome this obstacle, we introduce the concept of 
a shape function to more easily address the boundary 
condition. Let and be the local coordinates in the 
x-direction and y-direction, respectively. Then, we de-
fine and as:

The matrix A must satisfy the following relation: 
0, TA g gA  (26) 
where A is an element of the Lie algebra so(n,1) of the 
proper orthochronous Lorentz group 0 1SO (n, ) .This fact 
prompts us to devise the group-preserving numerical 
scheme (GPS), whose discretized mapping G. must 
exactly preserve the following properties:

Accordingly, Liu (2001) has developed a GPS to guar-
antee that each kX locates on the cone:

where kX denotes the numerical value of X at kt , and 
0G( ) 1k SO (n, ) satisfies the properties in (27) through 
(29).

The group properties are preserved in this scheme for

scheme. 
 
4. Numerical examples 
In this section, we consider six numerical examples to 
test the accuracy and stability of the proposed numeri-
cal method. In order to illustrate the initial guess pa-
rameters in the examples, m, nb , , 0u , , and t are 
used to denote the number of fictitious grids in the 
x-direction and y-direction, the total boundary points 
numbers, the convergence rate, the initial guess value, 
the stopping criterion, and the time step, respectively. 
Additionally, in order to conveniently compare the 
numerical results with the original MBECA method, 
which is proposed by Fan (2010), we use the same ini-
tial guess parameters in all examples. 
4.1 Examples 1 
For this example, we consider a two-dimensional arbi-
trary domain with mixed-type boundary conditions to 
test the accuracy and stability of this method. The 
computational domain is plotted in Fig. 2, and the con-
tour shape of this problem is given by: 
 ( , ) | cos 1.5,  sin 1.5,  0 2 ,x y x y            
 (37) 
where 
 132cos(3 ) 2 sin (3 ) .      (38) 
Then, we consider the following analytical solution: 
( , ) cos 20xu x y e y   (39) 
of the Laplace equation: 
2 0, ( , ) .u x y    (40) 
First, we consider a Dirichlet-type boundary condition 
and fix following parameters at m=20, nb =160, =10, 
0u =1,
510  , and 0.001t  . We compare our re-
sults with the convergence rate of the original MBECA 
method by fixing constant parameters; the results of the 
convergence plot are shown in Fig. 3(a). 
Red and blue lines denote the proposed and original 
methods, respectively. We find that the convergence 
rate of present scheme is better than that from the orig-
inal method. Fig. 3(b) shows the time history of the 
weighting factor under the GPS. We can observe that 
the weighting factor of the GPS clearly describes the 
nonlinear variation when the initial guess values are 
not suitable. That is to say, the original MBECA cannot 
preserve each fictitious time on the manifold under a 
forward Euler scheme, which does not has the cone 
structure and group properties of the GPS. Furthermore, 
Fig. 4 shows the time history of (1 )t  and the viscosi-
ty-damping coefficient. We find that the viscosi-
ty-damping trend is anti-symmetric with (1 )t  ; the 
viscosity-damping rate is match with (1 )t  due to the 
cone condition and the group properties. When the 
numerical solutions are closed to the true solutions, the 
viscosity damping coefficient varying with the

convergent algorithm to solve a nonlinear elliptic boundary value problem defined in an 
arbitrary plane domain. It is very difficult to solve nonlinear and geometric complexity 
problems by conventional FDM. To overcome these problems, concepts of internal re-

by adding a fictitious time coordinate, a shape function can be easily detour. Furthermore, 
we do not need to directly treat complex boundary conditions only by using the shape 
function, and without solving an inverse matrix of algebraic equation by the MBECA. 
Moreover, in order to in-crease the numerical stability of the MBECA, we in-troduced a 
group-preserving scheme to address fictitious time integration.
