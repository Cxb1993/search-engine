1. 前言 
通訊一直與人類的生活息息相關，以前人們靠著有線電話互相聯絡。隨著無線通訊技
術的進步，現在行動通訊幾乎成為人人不可或缺的產品之一。而網際網路的快速發展，使
得WWW (Worldwide Web)、電子郵件和即時通訊軟體大大拉進人與人之間的距離。通訊含
括的範圍十分廣泛，從十九世紀開始，人類致力於電磁現象的探索與開發，一方面除了利
用電磁波進行各種資源探勘及遙測外；另一面也據以廣播、電視與電話等通訊科技以進行
資訊的傳遞與流通，成為人類文明發展的一大里程碑。近年來，由於衛星、光纖、半導體
和計算機等科技領域的發展，使得電信科技快速發展，而深深影響了航太、國防及民生等
工業。近年來科技的進步，電信、資訊、視訊網路的合流，語音、數據、影像、音樂等各
種媒體及服務的整合，引導出一個全數位化的網路。隨著網際網路的蓬勃發展，寬頻網路
基礎建設、高速無線或有線接取、隨選視訊和多媒體等新服務的需求方興未艾，舉凡提高
用戶網路頻寬，應用光纖和數位用戶迴路技術，整合所有形式的有線及無線媒介，依據各
種電信科技媒體及應用傳輸的需要分配適當的頻寬，大量傳送任何形式的資訊，以滿足這
些新服務之需求等等，都需要藉助通訊相關之科技的研發。例如現今的行動通訊，從第一

微波存取全球互通(Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX) ， 是應用在
無線都會網路(Wirless Metropolitan Area Netework WMAN)。各種無線通訊系統，都需經由

了必須滿足系統所需頻寬外，還得考慮到製作簡單、體積小等方面，以符合輕、薄、短、
小以及低成本的訴求。

3. 文獻導覽 
現今，有許多文章都有刊載抑制諧波的解決方法。例如，在文章[1]中，扇形微帶天線
可以有效地抑制二次諧波，但卻犧牲了天線的基本操作模態的輻射效能。或是增加一個短
路棒(shorting pin)和嵌入槽孔(slot)到輻射金屬片來擾亂高階模態的電流分佈[2-3]，作者證明
了諧波可以有效的被抑制。另外，也有一些關的文章提出蝕刻接地面的方法來抑制天線的
諧波共振。例如具有週期性的槽孔接地面[4]和穿孔的接地面[5]都能有效的抑制多餘的模
態。在早期，通常會使用較大接地面的(photonic band gap)結構，或是 DGS (defected ground 
structure)結構[6]，但後期，PBG 結構卻面臨具有較大的背向輻射的缺點，另外，也可針對
微帶天線使用微帶濾波器[7-10]。然而，這些技術在抑制諧波的旁生輻射的同時，經常都犠
牲了輻射效能及設計的簡單性。在文章[11]中，作者介紹 H 形狀的 DGS (defected ground

Abstract -This paper presents an integrated patch antenna for mode-controlling. The
harmonics and spurious suppression were effectively achieved by adding modified
periodic loads to the microstrip line. In this study, the proposed integrated microstrip
antenna not only suppressed the harmonics resonance within quad band, but also
retained the impedance matching and radiation performances of the original antenna.
The results suggest that the spurious control and design simplicity of an integrated
microstrip antenna can be achieved simultaneously. This article presents simple design
principles to control the harmonics resonance and spurious emission, and discusses the
design and experimental results for the spurious-free integrated circular patch antenna.
1. Introduction
There have been several articles for the IMA with regard to the characteristics of
harmonics suppression. In order to suppress the harmonics resonance, the studies in
[ 1-21 adopted some techniques such as adding short pins and slits to disturb the current
distribution of the higher order mode of the rectangular patch antenna. However, these
designs seem to be ineffectual for circular microstrip antennas because of its
non-longitudinal current distribution of the higher-order mode. In the article [3], the
sector circular microstrip antenna effectively suppressed the second harmonic at the
expense of the radiation performance of the operated mode. In addition, the Photonic
Bandgap structures, which excel in forbidding wave propagation in some frequency
bands, have been also widely applied to microwave circuits design for harmonics
suppression [4]. On the other hand, the approach presented in this paper is applicable.
By adding modified periodic loads to a microstrip line and choosing suitable geometry
dimension, we found that the proposed integrated microstrip antennas not only retained
good performance, but also eliminated harmonic resonances and spurious emission.
The experimental results indicate that the impedance matching and radiation
characteristics under the fundamental mode operation remained unaffected in spite of
the added quasi-periodical structure, and harmonics and spurious within the quad band
were completely suppressed.
2. Antenna design and experimental results
Figure 1 shows the geometry of the proposed integrated harmonic-free circular
microstrip antenna. The circular radiating patch with radius ofR was printed on an FR4
microwave substrate. In this study, the geometry parameters of h and e, were chosen to
be 1.6 mm and 4.4mm respectively. The inset length I of the microstrip line and the
gap g between the inset microstrip line and the radiating patch were set to be 16 mm

Abstract -This paper presents a novel microstrip filter design for tunable rejection
band. The proposed was mainly with a defected ground structure. A ladder-shaped slot,
which was located below the 50-fl microstrip line, was embedded in the ground plane.
For a fixed dimension, about 100% adjustment in rejection band was obtained by
simply modifying the geometry parameters of the embedded slot. Experimental results
indicate that the band control and design simplicity of the microstrip bandstop filter
can be achieved simultaneously. In this article, the author discusses the design and
experimental results for the adjustable bandstop filter.
1. Introduction
Microstrip filters are very promising for monolithic microwave integrated circuits
(MMlCs) with its easy synthesis. Many kinds of such designs have been presented. For
instance, a couple-line filter was easily fabricated in passband or stopband filters with a
narrower bandwidth [1]. To equalize the modal-phase velocities of the even- and odd
modes, and control the second harmonic resulted from the electromagnetic field
distribution of the modes, the rejection characteristics of the filter at twice the amount
of the passband frequency fo were enhanced by involving a ground plane aperture
beneath the coupling section [2], wiggly-line couple stage [3]. The Photonic Bandgap
structures, which excel in forbidding wave propagation in some frequency bands, have
been widely applied to microwave circuits design for harmonics suppression. Available
approaches to the structures include the PBG ground plane [4] and defected ground
plane [5-6]. All in all, an applicable microstrip filter with a simple structure and
suitable rejection bandwidth is expected for the suppression of the harmonics
resonance and spurious emission. This paper presents a new bandstop microstrip filter
design for tunable rejection band. The design involved a ladder-shaped slot, which was
embedded in the ground plane and located below the microstrip line, to form a defected
ground structure (DGS). Generally, the DGS was considered as an equivalent circuit
consisting of resistance, inductance and capacitance. The equivalent element R, L, and
C can be controlled by the geometry of DGS. In other words, the frequency responses
can be effectively controlled by using suitable DGS. In this design, about 100%
adjustment in rejection band was achieved by simple modifications of geometry
parameters of the ladder-shaped slot.
2. Filter design and experimental results
Figure 1 shows the proposed DGS, in which a 50-Q transmission line was printed on a
microwave substrate with thickness ofh and relative permittivity of F'. Also, the design
involved a ladder-shaped slot, which was embedded in the ground plane and located
0-7803-8883-6/05/$20.00 @2005 IEEE

3. Conclusion
This paper has presented a new technique for the tunable bandstop filter. The proposed
mainly involved a ladder-shaped defected ground structure. For a fixed dimension of
the embedded slot, a significant adjustment in the characteristics of the proposed filter
was obtained. Also, the optimum configuration for larger stopband was demonstrated.
Designers can easily meet the requirement of circuit by simple adjusting of the slot
geometry.

and hence it is believed that rectangular SRRs are very interesting
particles for the suppression of undesired frequency bands or for
the elimination of frequency parasitics in microwave or millime-
ter-wave circuits. It is also remarkable that some ripple in the
allowed band is present in the EBG structure, but absent in the
SRR-based device. In the latter structure, the signal does not see
the rings out of resonance, and this explains the low level of
in-band losses, as compared to the EBG microstrip line. This is an
important aspect in favor of the use of rectangular SRRs to
suppress undesired spurious in microwave devices or to reject
potential frequency parasitics that may be present in the vicinity of
their operative bandwidth.
4. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, a comparative analysis of the rejection band char-
acteristics of microstrip lines loaded with rectangular-shaped
SRRs and EBG microstrip lines has been carried out in this work.
The main relevant conclusion of the work is that by using SRRs,
the dimensions of the structure can be made much smaller than in
the case of a microstrip line with a periodic perturbation of line
geometry (for similar gap width and rejection level). It is believed
that SRRs and other related subwavelength resonators can ﬁnd
practical application as small-rejection-band structures. For this
reason, these structures have been patented.

1. INTRODUCTION
Patch antennas with microstrip feed-line are very promising in
modern wireless-communication systems for their features of good
polarization and ease of integration with the MMIC. In these
systems, the microstrip antenna acts not only as a radiator, but also
as a resonator for the power ampliﬁers in the active circuitry.
However, such an antenna can introduce a detrimental electromag-
netic compatibility (EMC) problem into the system if it lacks a
proper design to suppress the harmonic resonance and spurious
emission. Generally, a bandpass ﬁlter is placed between the mi-
crostrip antenna and the ampliﬁer to solve this problem. However,
the added ﬁlter may signiﬁcantly affect the impedance matching of
the microstrip antenna operating at the fundamental resonant fre-
quency, and thus degrade system performance. Alternative solu-
tions include modifying the patch geometry [1], using a photonic
bandgap (PBG) structure [2], adding a shorting pin and embedded
slots to the feed point and nonradiating edge [3], and using a
microstrip ﬁlter [4–7] for the microstrip antenna. However, these
methods achieve harmonic and spurious suppression at the ex-
pense of either radiation performance or design simplicity.
This paper presents a new harmonic-suppression technique for
the square microstrip antenna. The design involves an inset mi-
crostrip-line feed, added with appropriate loads. The frequency
response of loaded line is similar to that of the PBG structure;
wave propagation is forbidden in some frequency bands, and
therefore the 2nd and 3rd harmonic resonances were effectively
suppressed. The experimental results indicate that the impedance
matching and antenna performance under fundamental-mode op-
eration remain unaffected in spite of the added loads. This paper
ﬁrst describes the characteristics of the loaded transmission line
and presents simple design principles for estimating the frequency
response of the structure in section 2. The harmonic-suppression
design and measured results are given in section 3. The measured
return loss and radiation patterns are presented in order to conﬁrm
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TRANSMISSION LINE

dimensions of 2 1 mm2. To suppress the 2nd harmonic resonance
and excite the fundamental mode of the microstrip antennas, we
determined the ﬁrst resonance of the loaded line to be the same as
the operating frequency of the microstrip antenna. The distance S
and the side length r1 were determined by Eqs. (1) and (2) to be 13
and 5.8 mm, respectively. The distances d1 and d2 were both set
to be 5.6 mm. The central line of the two cells overlapped that of
the radiating patch’s edge and the feeding line’s edge. In addition,
r2 was chosen to be 4.1 mm. Figure 5 demonstrates the measured
return losses of the reference antenna and the proposed antennas 1
and 2. Apparently, for antenna 1 with only two larger cells, good
excitation of the TM01 mode was obtained, and the possible
excitations of the TM02, TM21 (the 2nd harmonic), and TM22
modes were suppressed successfully. As for antenna 2, it not only
realized the performances of antenna 1, but also effectively sup-
pressed the TM03 mode (the 3rd harmonic). Moreover, the imped-
ance matching for fundamental-mode operation did not need any
adjustment for both designs. This feature suggests that the design
of a regular microstrip antenna and the solution for harmonic
suppression can be conducted separately, and then integrated with-
out further retuning. Figure 6 shows the x–y and y–z plane
radiation patterns of the reference antenna and the proposed an-
tenna 2, resonating at the fundamental [Fig. 6(a)], 2nd [Fig. 6(b)],
and 3rd [Fig. 6(c)] harmonics, respectively. The fundamental-mode
radiation patterns of the proposed antenna 2 were almost the same
as those of the reference antenna; on the other hand, the radiation
of the 2nd and 3rd harmonics of the proposed one was effectively
reduced.
4. CONCLUSION
This paper has presented a new harmonic-suppression technique
for microstrip-antenna designs. The proposed design can be con-
structed easily by adding appropriate loads to the feeding line. The
experimental results conﬁrmed that, at the fundamental resonant
mode, the 2nd and 3rd harmonic resonances were effectively sup-
pressed, and the antenna still sustained good performance.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the design and development of a
dual-polarized shaped-beam antenna for airborne synthetic aperture
radar (SAR). A multilayer, stacked, printed antenna with electromag-
netic coupling is chosen as the radiating element due to wide band-
width and low cross polarization. Shaping in elevation plane is
achieved by employing the null-perturbation technique in order to
obtain complex excitation distribution. Many sets of coefﬁcients giv-
ing the same power patterns were obtained and the set with the mini-
mum current taper ratio was selected for realization of the antenna.
A planar array of 8  8 elements is designed and developed at the
C band. The measured and simulated radiation patterns and return-
loss performance are also presented. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1. INTRODUCTION
The desirable features of antennas for airborne synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) applications include multipolarization with good
cross-polarization isolation, shaped radiation pattern, and wide
bandwidth capability. Shaped radiation pattern across the track
improves the target dynamic range and compensates the require-
ment of sensitivity time control (STC) correction at the receiver
end. Wide-bandwidth performance results in ﬁner resolution and
multipolarization yields a better classiﬁcation of targets. Planar-
array antennas are preferred, as compared to reﬂector-type anten-
nas, for less air drag. The SAR system presented is conﬁgured for
dual-polarization capability using a single antenna with a swath of
100 km, operating at an altitude of 8 Km. Dual-polarized shaped
patterns with bandwidth on the order of 1% to 2% was reported in
[1]. Patterns-synthesis techniques are available in [2–4] for the
required shaping. This paper presents a printed planar array offer-
ing bandwidth of more than 10%, which is not possible with a
waveguide slotted array, which offers only 1% to 2% bandwidth.
Proper selection of the radiating element for a planar array
dictates the requirements of large bandwidth and low cross polar-
ization with dual polarization via a single aperture. A multilayer,
stacked, electromagnetically coupled printed antenna is selected,
which overcomes the bandwidth limitation of the conventional
microstrip antenna [5]. Although it offers the advantage of opti-
mizing the feeder network and patch independently, the aperture-
coupled antenna has poor impedance matching due to improper
grounding when a coaxial feed below the ground is required for the
array. In the present conﬁguration, dual polarization is achieved by
taking the top and bottom patches to be square shaped with
orthogonal feeding.
The complex excitation coefﬁcients for the required shape are
computed using the null-perturbation technique in which the roots
of the polynomial are moved in both radial and angular directions
in the shaped region, with only angular displacement for the
nonshaped region, as described in [3]. It is possible to achieve
lesser ripple with a larger number of elements (16 or more) in the
array, as described in [4]. This paper presents the design and
development of a shaped radiation pattern within 35° with only
eight elements and with ripple level better than 0.5 dB. Eight
elements in the linear array also make it possible to design the
feeder network for dual polarization with corporate feeding within
the limited available inter-element spacing, thus making the feed
network less frequency sensitive.
2. DESIGN AND SIMULATIONS
A multilayer printed antenna is selected as the basic radiating
element due to its large bandwidth, and a square patch shape is
selected to enable dual polarization. In this structure, the micro-
strip patch is effectively printed on foam material whose dielectric
constant is nearly equal to air in order to enhance the bandwidth
and also to minimize the surface-wave propagation. Since the
patch cannot be printed on the foam material, it is printed on the
opposite face of the dielectric sheet, which can be used as a radome
to protect the antenna from the environment. An electromagnetic
coupled feed was selected in order to avoid soldering the connec-

tagonal monopole, we obtained a controllable notched frequency
band within the UWB operating bandwidth. More promisingly, the
entire antenna dimension is largely reduced, which is superior to
other designs of printed planar monopoles for UWB operation [6].
2. ANTENNA DESIGN
Figure 1(a) shows the geometries of the ﬁrst design (Design 1),
printed on a rectangular FR4 substrate, with thickness h of 1.6 mm
and relative permittivity r of 4.4. The radiator was a rectangular
patch with a beveled angle  on both the upper corners, so that
they yielded a pentagonal monopole. To meet the requirement of
UWB communication systems, the angle  was adjusted by ex-
periment in this study. A 50- coaxial line, feeding at the lower
edge’s center, was adopted to excite the proposed antenna. On the
other side of the substrate, there was a ground plane with a
dimension of L2  W2. In applications, this ground plane can be
considered as the ground plane of the system board. Figure 1(b)
shows the conﬁguration of the Design 2, which had the same
dimension as Design 1 except for a simple inverted-V-shaped slot.
The slot was embedded along the boundary of the printed pentag-
onal monopole in order to achieve band-notched operation, and
was symmetric with respect to the central axis of the monopole.
The slot had a uniform width W3 and had a small distance ds and
dt from the side- and top-edge of the printed pentagonal monopole,
respectively. The total length (L) of the inverted-V-shaped slot was

Introduction 
 
Planar monopole antennas are eye-catching for its simple geometry and yet 
provide a very wide impedance bandwidth [1, 2]. Simply by adjusting the patch’s 
length to width [3] and beveling patch’s edge [4], the obtained impedance 
bandwidth can largely increase and easily cover the recently proposed UWB 
communication systems over the frequency band of 3.1–10.6 GHz. However, 
UWB transmitters should not cause any electromagnetic interference (EMI) on 
nearby communication systems such as wireless LAN systems (5725–5875 MHz). 
Therefore, a UWB antenna having a frequency band notch characteristic is 
desirable. In [5-6], it was shown that by etching a particular feature in the interior 
of the radiating element, a planar monopole can exhibit a narrow frequency notch 
band while maintaining ultra-wideband performance. In this paper, we 
demonstrate that by embedding a simple slot close to and along the boundary of 
the printed pentagon monopole, a notched frequency band in the UWB operating 
bandwidth can be obtained and easily controlled. Especially, compare to the 
design proposed in [6], the antenna dimension was largely reduced about 50%. 
 
Antenna Design 
 
Figure 1(a) shows the geometries of the first design (Design 1) printed on a 
square grounded FR4 substrate with thickness h of 1.6 mm and relative 
permittivity εr of 4.4. The radiator was a pentagonal patch with an included angle 
φ on the upper edge. For experimental study, φ was adjusted to make the 
impedance bandwidth meet the requirement of UWB communication systems. A 
50-Ω coaxial line, feeding at the lower edge’s center, was adopted to excite the 
proposed antenna. On the other side of the substrate, there was a ground plane 
with a dimension of L2 × W2. In applications, this ground plane can be considered 
as the ground plane of system board. The occupied area (A) of the proposed 
antenna was:

Introduction 
 
For narrow slot antenna, many microstrip-fed and coplanar waveguide-fed 
studies disclosed. The studies for dual- and multi-band operation [1-2], which 
were achieved by using technique of multipath, are mainly interested. 
However, the widely use of planar narrow slot antenna is still limited by its 
inherently narrow impedance bandwidth. On the other hand, Through the use 
of photonic bandgap (PBG) structures, which forbid the propagation of 
electromagnetic waves in certain frequency bands, it has been reported that 
microstrip antennas can have enhanced radiation performances [4-6]. By using 
of periodic structures, such as photonic bandgap (PBG) structures, is 
especially noted for enhancing impedance bandwidth. In this article, we 
present two promising applications of the periodic structure to the 
microstrip-fed narrow slot antenna (NSA). The proposed designs, which were 
linear- and square-ring NSA, had an array of 3 × 3 meandered dipole-type 
slots and ring-type slots on the antenna’s ground planes, respectively. 
Experimental studies were progressed to find the effects of periodic surface on 
the characteristics of NSA.  It was found that by resembling the shapes of 
periodic element in radiating element, a seven times enhancement of 
impedance bandwidth was obtained. The antenna design and experimental 
results are described in detail in this study, and the constructed prototypes for 
wireless communication systems of DCS (1710–1880 MHz), PCS (1850–1990 
MHz), UMTS (1920–2170 MHz) operations are also presented. 
 
Antenna Design 
 
Figure 1(a) shows the geometries of the first design (Design 1) fabricated on a 
square grounded FR4 substrate (thickness h = 1.6 mm and relative permittivity 
εr = 4.4) with dimension of 60×60 mm2. The main radiator was a linear slot 
with 2 mm width and 43 mm length. The periodic structure, with an array of 
3×3 meandered dipole-type elements spaced out s1, was etched on the ground 
plane. The s1 is also called as “period” of the periodic structure. The width and 
total length of the dipole-type element was denoted as g1 and l1. Figure 1(b) 
shows the configuration of the Design 2, which had the same dimension as 
Design 1. The main radiator, a square ring slot, had an outer side length of 
31.5 mm and an inner side length of 27.5 mm. The periodic structure, etched 
on the ground plane, was also constructed with an array of 3×3 square-ring 
type elements with side length l2, width g2 and periodic s2. In this study, the 
lengths of the periodic elements (l1 and l2) are about equal to half a guided
