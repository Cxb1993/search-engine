framework includes: (1) constructing the objectives of the ERP 
implementation project, (2) combining the strategic objectives of 
organization and he objectives of the ERP implementation project, (3) 
developing the common objectives, (4) extracting suitable ERP 
performance indicators and constructing their structure, and (5)

Abstract  
This project constructed a framework 
to elaborate the process of performance 
indicator development to link the ERP 
performance assessment contents with the 
strategic considerations of an enterprise. 
Managers can generate their strategic 
objectives by using the balanced-scorecard. 
Additionally, some common management 
objectives also can be defined. By using a 
systematic discussion method and Cause 
and Effect Network Graph, managers can 
extract some ERP objectives based on these 
strategic objectives and common 
management objectives. Then, they can 
discuss and analyze the relationship 
between the ERP objectives and ERP 
performance indicators. Extracting the 
knowledge of performance indicators, 
managers can describe the detailed contents 
of each performance indicators and develop 
the consistent evaluation guides. 
Additionally, a qualitative and quantitative 
performance measurement model will be 
presented by using fuzzy set theory. 
According to the results of ERP 
performance evaluation, managers can 
verify that the ERP performance evaluation 
process is in line with the competitive 
strategies and goals of the enterprise and 
guide the strategic plan for system 
improvement. Additionally, they also can 
modify and update their ERP system to 
ensure that the ERP system can effectively 
and efficiently support the strategic 
objectives and management activities..

Figure 1. Value chain model in enterprise logistics [2] 
 
they can be replenished many times during a selling season. 
Matsuyama [4] extended the classical newsboy model into a 
multi-period problem. In a multi-period newsboy model, the 
retailer must consider the sales results of last period and the 
expected demand of this period to decide the ordering 
quantity at the beginning of this period. If some unsold goods 
remained last period, the inventory holding cost must be 
incurred. Additionally, the ordering quantity of this period 
must be determined by calculating unsold inventory. If there 
is unsatisfied demand in last period, the ordering quantity of 
this period must be considered how to complement 
unsatisfied demand.   
For enhancing the coordination of supply chain, 
manufactures and retailers can adopt and negotiate many 
mechanisms, like wholesale price, cost sharing or subsidy 
provisions for holding inventory, backordering to meet 
unsatisfied demand, and return policies [3, 5-7]. These 
coordination policies share the cost and risk, increase profits 
and broaden real demand of market. Then, the profits of the 
whole supply chain and individual members can be 
enhanced.       
This paper will extend the model of [4] to solve the 
multi-period newsboy problems. Some coordination 
mechanisms will be considered to achieve the channel 
coordination and increase the profit of the channel and 
members in a supply chain. A numerical analysis will be 
provided to illustrate the proposed model.   
 
III. THE MODELS 
This paper considers a multi-period newsboy model for 
integrating both a retailer and the manufacturer. A 
manufacturer produces a product to a retailer. The product 
has short selling season or lifecycle, but it can be ordered 
once at beginning of each period during the selling season. 
The market demand is uncertain. Assume the sale price is 
fixed. If some unsold products remain, no any returns of 
remaining inventory are allowed except the end of selling 
season. But some inventory holding cost will occur at a 
specified period. Additionally, the portion of remaining 
inventory can be sold at next period. Conversely, if there is 
some unsatisfied demand, goodwill cost will be charged at a 
specified period. Assume some customers are willing to wait 
and get the product at next period. Then, a ratio of the amount 
of unsatisfied demand can be complemented at next period. 
No any salvage exists for both the retailer and manufacturer. 
In order to formulate the problem, the following symbols 
will be introduced first. 
xi : total amount of demand during the ith period 
f(xi) : probability density function of demand at the ith period 
pi : selling price per unit of the product by the retailer at the 
ith period 
qi : ordering quantity of the retailer at the beginning of the ith 
period 
wi : whole sales price per unit of the product from the 
manufacturer at the ith period 
ci : manufacturing cost per unit by the manufacturer at the ith 
period 
li : initial inventory level at the beginning of the ith period 
gi : goodwill cost per unit due to stockout incurred by the 
retailer at the ith period 
hi : holding cost per unit at the ith period  
SRi : setup cost by the retailer at the ith period  
SMi : setup cost by the manufacturer at the ith period 
STi : setup cost by the channel at the ith period e 
iii SMSRST +=  
α : ratio of the amount stocked to the amount unsold, 10 ≤≤ α   
β : ratio of the amount sold at the beginning of next period to 
the amount of unsatisfied demand during present period, 
0 1β≤ ≤  
In this paper, some coordination policies are adopted, 
including inventory holding cost sharing, and unsatisfied 
demand backordering mechanisms for each period and a 
return policy at the end of the selling season. As space is 
limited, we only present the framework of our models as 
Figure 2. 
Condition 1. If the real demand was smaller than the initial 
inventory in the previous period, 11 −− ≤ ii lx , some inventories 
was burdened by the retailer. Then, the inventory holding 
cost is incurred by the retailer. The retailer must consider the 
inventory level to decide the ordering quantity in the 
beginning of the current period.  
After coordinating with the manufacturer, the 
manufacturer is willing to share the inventory holding cost to 
reduce the risk of the retailer.  
Condition 2. If the real demand was larger than the initial
