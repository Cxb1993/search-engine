convection, mixed convection, and 
natural convection, Goertler 
vortices on flat and curved (concave 
or comvex) wall,  and vortex 
instability in a rotating boundary 
layer.  
This proposal is intended to employ 
experimental onset criteria studying 
the following subjects:  
1. Study of the effect of 
electromagnetic force on the 
vortex instability of wall jet flow 
over a heated rotating flat plate, 
2. Study of the effect of 
electromagnetic force on the 
vortex instability of wall jet flow 
over a heated rotating curved 
surface.  
The numerical experiment would be 
applied, and confirm the results 
with the experimental data. It  is 
believed that the results are to be as 
an important reference on boundary 
layer control and effective cooling 
in engineering.

The physical configuration of wall jet in 
rotating coordinates is shown Fig. 1. The 
results of perturbation quantities of velocity 
and temperatures for Ro=0, -0.1, 2, and -1 
on concave surface are shown in Fig. 2~5. 
The magnitude of v and w are larger than 
those of u and t because the scaling factor 
Re-1/2 is included in these quantities. The 
transverse perturbation velocity amplitude w 
behaves like a sine function in the 
η-direction. Negative perturbation velocity v
