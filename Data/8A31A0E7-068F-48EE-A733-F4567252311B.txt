solid state construction, and the possibility of 
miniaturization. However, pH-ISFET devices 
up to now have been limited to biomedical 
applications such as in vivo use of 
catheter-tip ISFETs [1], so that the glass 
electrodes are still dominant pH sensors in 
most applications. This is due to the pH 
sensors have some disadvantages, such as 
drift, hysteresis and photo-sensitivity [4-8], 
which lower the accuracy of the sensors. In 
addition, alkali metal ion sensitivity [9] and 
corrosion [10] restrain the application to pH 
measurement in strong acid and alkali 
solutions. High-k dielectric materials, 
including HfO2, ZrO2, and Gd2O3 [11-13], 
can be considered as a sensing membrane for 
pH-ISFET application. In general, high-k 
gate dielectrics need to be thermally and 
chemically stable on silicon substrates. 
Furthermore, they are also required to have a 
large dielectric constant, small leakage 
current, and good interface quality. 
Rare-earth oxides have attracted attention 
as such material because of their reasonably 
high permittivities, low leakage currents, 
relatively large conduction band offsets, 
large band gaps, and thermodynamic stability 
with Si [14-16]. On the other hand, 
Mikhelashvili et al. [17] reported that Er2O3 
thin film deposited on Si substrate exhibited 
a low leakage current density and a high 
breakdown electric field. In this paper, we 
studied on the physical and sensing 
properties of high-k Er2O3 sensing films 
grown on Si (100) substrate. The growth 
directions and the crystallinity of the films 
were investigated by XRD. The surface 
roughness of Er2O3 sensing films after 
annealing at various temperatures was 
characterized with AFM. The chemical 
structure of sensing films was analyzed by 
XPS. It is shown that the post-deposition 
annealing (PDA) temperature plays an 
important role in the formation of the silicate 
and of the interfacial layer at the dielectric/Si 
interface. Furthermore, sensing 
characteristics including pH sensitivity, 
hysteresis and drift are shown for Er2O3 films 
after PDA treatment. 
 
三、實驗 
The EIS devices with Er2O3 sensing 
membranes were fabricated 4-in p-type (100) 
Si wafers having a resistivity of 5-10 Ω-cm. 
Prior to Er2O3 deposition, the wafers were 
cleaned using a standard RCA process and 
then dipped in 1% hydrofluoric acid to 
remove native oxide from the surface. A ~12 
nm Er2O3 film was deposited on the Si 
substrate. Samples were annealed at different 
temperatures by RTA in O2 ambient for 30 
sec. A 4000-Å-thick Al film was deposited as 
the backside contact of the Si wafer. The 
sensing membrane size was defined through 
photolithographic processing under a 
photosensitive epoxy that behaves as an 
antiacid polymer. EIS devices were then 
fabricated on the copper lines of a printed 
circuit board by using a silver gel to form 
conductive lines. A hand-made epoxy 
package was employed to separate the EIS 
structure and the copper line. 
The surface morphologies of the Er2O3 
sensing films were analyzed using AFM. The 
film structure and composition of Er2O3 
dielectric films after PDA at various 
temperatures were examined by XRD and 
 2
Er-silicate increased suddenly at 800 °C. 
This finding suggests that the erbium moving 
from the Er2O3 film was mostly consumed by 
the larger formation of ErSixOy layer.  
It has been reported that the roughness 
at the dielectric/electrode interface can 
significantly affect the pH sensitivity [11]. 
The AFM surface morphologies of the Er2O3 
sensing films after PDA at different 
temperatures were shown in Fig. 3. The 
surface roughness of the Er2O3 films clearly 
increased upon increasing the PDA 
temperature, but decreased suddenly at 800 
°C. The increase in surface roughness after 
RTA treatment is plausibly due to 
crystallization and/or grain growth during 
annealing. During high-temperature 
annealing, the erbium atom removed from 
the film mostly migrated to the interface and 
increased the formation of an amorphous 
silicate layer, resulting in a smaller surface 
roughness. 
Figure 4 shows one group of C-V 
curves of the EIS structure using a high-k 
Er2O3 film that had been subjected to PDA at 
700 °C in different pH buffer solutions. A 
group of C-V curves as a function of 
different pH solutions was measured to 
determine the pH sensitivity of the gate 
sensing membrane. The pH sensitivity of the 
EIS device arises from the ionization by 
hydrogen ions or hydroxyl ions of the surface 
hydroxyl groups. The variation of the pH 
solution leads to the flatband voltage shift in 
the C-V curves. The reference voltages are 
obtained from the C-V curves for achieving 
the normalized capacitance of 0.2. The 
results indicate the shift of reference voltage 
for Er2O3 sensing films during a cycle of 
experiments from pH 2 to pH 12, as shown in 
the inset of Fig. 4. These C-V curves were 
shifted as a result of the surface potential 
modification by the formation of hydrogen 
ion dipole on the sensing film. It is found that 
EIS devices that had been subjected to PDA 
at 700 °C show a high pH sensitivity of 58.47 
mV/pH and good linearity  
The pH sensitivity of Er2O3 sensing 
membranes as a function of RTA 
temperatures is shown in Fig. 5. The EIS 
device after RTA at 700 °C exhibits a higher 
pH sensitivity than other PDA temperatures, 
suggesting a large surface roughness and a 
thin Er-silicate. According to the 
double-layer model [20], the pH sensitivity 
relies on the hydrogen ion concentration and 
surface potential. It is found that Er2O3 gate 
sensing membrane annealed at 800 °C is a 
higher pH sensitivity compared to 600 °C. 
This is due to a larger surface roughness 
during this RTA temperature, thus a high 
density of surface hydroxyl groups. Table I 
summarizes the surface roughness and 
sensing characteristics of high-k Er2O3 EIS 
devices for different RTA treatments. 
We subjected the EIS capacitors 
prepared under the Er2O3 sensing film to pH 
loops of 7→4→7→10→7 and 
7→10→7→4→7 over a period of 1500 s. A 
smaller hysteresis voltage of the Er2O3 
sensing films after RTA at 700 °C is 6.23 
mV and 12.4 mV in the pH loops 
7→4→7→10→7 and 7→ 10→7→4→7, 
respectively, as shown in Fig. 6. This may be 
due to the rough surface and the thin 
Er-silicate. It is noteworthy that the acid-side
