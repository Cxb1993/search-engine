英文摘要 
    A simple but powerful digital-to-time converter, or digital 
pulse generator, realizable with FPGA chips is proposed. Based 
on vernier principle, the effective resolution is made equivalent 
to the period difference of two phase-locked loop (PLL) outputs 
and is achieved as fine as 3.56ps with Altera Stratix II GX FPGA 
chips. The programmable delay range wider than ever is verified 
to be 33.4 minutes. The measured integral nonlinearity (INL) is 
between -0.23LSB to 0.2LSB (-0.8ps~0.7ps). It ensures every 
input bit is valid under such fine resolution. Only two embedded 
PLLs and some standard logic cells are required for circuit 
realization. Compared with its predecessors’, both design effort 
and chip cost of the proposed converter are lowered 
substantially. 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
The digital-to-time converter (DTC), one of the most 
important cores of automatic test equipments (ATE), 
measurement instruments and digital testing systems, 
generates a time signal with a width proportional to the 
programmed input value. It is extensively used by digital 
IC BIST (built-in self-test) applications for cost reduction. 
Due to different operational principles adopted, the 
digital-to-time conversion can be fulfilled by the absolute 
[1,5,7] or relative [2-4,6] time generation. The absolute 
time generation can be utilized to provide wide delay 
range with low offset. However the demerits are 
comparatively poor resolution and more sensitivity to PVT 
(process, voltage and temperature) variations. For the 
relative time generation, the effective resolution equals the 
delay difference between different transmission paths. The 
resolution can be made extremely fine, but the 
performance is easily hampered by the path or device 
mismatch. With 0 input, the delays of different paths 
cannot be made exactly the same after fabrication and 
there always exists a large offset. 
  For performance enhancement, the conventional 
DTCs were realized with GaAs or Bipolar processes based 
on the absolute time generation principle. Limited by the 
inherent accuracy of the DAC and comparator used, the 
achieved measurement range and resolution were 15.875ns 
and 125ps only [1]. Later, the programmable vernier delay 
line and calibration RAM were utilized to improve the 
resolution to 40ps [2]. Furthermore, the vernier delay lines 
were replaced with the delay matrices which composed of 
limited to one Ts. If the TDC operation is reversed as 
depicted in Fig. 1(b), the vernier principle can be applied 
likewise to high accuracy DTC. Both Ts and Tf signals 
oscillate continuously with small period difference ΔT. 
After the phase coincidence of Ts and Tf, each oscillation 
will add one more ΔT delay between Ts and Tf signals. If 
Tf and Ts signals are programmed to oscillate n cycles to 
activate Start and Stop signals correspondingly after phase 
coincidence, the width of output interval can also be 
derived as 
outT n T= Δ ,                                
(2) 
which is exactly proportional to the input value n and 
successfully fulfills the function of digital-to-time 
conversion. 
It deserves noticing that the width of output interval 
is no longer limited to one Ts since no restriction is 
imposed on the value of n which can be set to any value as 
required. However, the output latency reaches nTf which 
will be turned out to be unbearable for large n. Fortunately, 
a single-stage vernier TDC with self interpolation was 
invented to substantially extend the operation range with 
the timing diagram illustrated in Fig. 2(a) [10]. After the 
arrival of Start signal, a coarse counter was adopted to 
count the oscillations of the activated Ts signal until Stop 
signal arrived. Then the other fine counter was stimulated 
to count the racing oscillations between Tf and Ts signals 
before the phase coincidence. The input time width was 
derived as 
( )in coarse fine s s f sT T T T T T T Tα β α β= + = + − = + Δ , (3) 
where α and β represent the counting values of the 
coarse and fine counters accordingly. The operation 
principle can also be reversely applied to DTC for output 
latency reduction as depicted in Fig. 2(b) where CNTf and 
CNTs represent the down counters clocking by Tf and Ts 
signals respectively to count the cycles before setting Start 
and Stop signals. After phase coincidence, both counters 
start counting and the first β cycles of Tf and Ts signals 
are used to generate βΔT delay difference between Start 
and Stop signals. Then, CNTs is allowed to count extra α 
cycles for producing additional αTs delay difference. The 
width of output signal becomes 
( ) ( )out s f s s f sT T T T T T T Tα β β α β α β= + − = + − = + Δ .(4) 
For a required output width nΔT in Fig. 1(b) or 
equivalent αTs+βΔT in Fig. 2(b), we have

where ⎣x⎦ denotes the largest integer less than or 
equal to x and y mod z computes the remainder of y÷z. 
Usually, ΔT is designed to be much smaller than Ts. The 
output latency is reduced to merely βTf which is 
tremendously less than nTf for wide output. 
四、 電路描述 
Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of the proposed DTC 
which realizes the digital-to-time conversion function 
described in Fig. 2(b). Since the rise edges of Ts and Tf 
signals can be synchronized to that of Tref signal by 
phase-locked loops PLLs and PLLf, each rise edge of Tref 
signal indicates one phase coincidence of Ts and Tf 
signals. A period signal generator is added to set the 
output repetition rate and two output pulse generators are

五、 測量結果 
Except for phase-locked loops, all sub-circuits in Fig. 
3 only utilize standard digital logics which can be readily 
implemented with FPGA chips. Fortunately, there are 
usually several embedded phase-locked loops which can 
be used as PLLs and PLLf in nowadays FPGA chips. By 
full FPGA realization, the design effort and cost of the 
proposed DTC can be significantly reduced. For function 
verification and performance evaluation, Altera Stratix II 
GX FPGA is adopted for circuit implementation. Since the 
DTC accuracy is dominated by the performance of 
phase-locked loops, the simplified PLL block diagram of 
the Stratix II GX FPGA is re-plotted in Fig. 5 along with 
the important design parameters listed in Table I for easy 
reference. To achieve the finest resolution, the divisors (M) 
of PLL output frequency dividers should be designed the 
closest to each other. 
For Altera Stratix II GX series, the PLL output 
frequency Fout is limited to 550MHz. The finest 
resolution can be gotten by setting the input frequency Fin 
to 2.148MHz, the output frequency devisor M of 
PLLs/PLLf to 511/512, the input reference divisor D to 2 
and the post-scale counter divisor C to 1. The output 
frequency can be derived as 
out inF F D M C= ÷ × ÷ .                     (12)

The effective resolution reaches

For such an extraordinary fine resolution, the DTC 
output width was still measured from 1ΔT to 2Ts for every 
input value to validate both coarse and fine resolutions and 
reveal the excellence of the propose circuit. The reference 
clock was generated by Agilent 81130A 400/660MHz 
Pulse/Pattern Generator. The delay difference between 
Start and Stop signals was accurately measured by 
Tektronix DPO 70404 digital oscilloscope with 25GS/s 
real time sample rate. Fig. 6 illustrates the output interval 
width versus the digital input value. Unlike the 
conventional versions, the proposed DTC has no device 
mismatch problem and thus possesses excellent linearity. 
The integral nonlinearity is verified to be merely 
-0.23~0.2LSB as depicted in Fig. 7. It ensures that every 
input bit is valid. The DTC functions well with 49 input 
bits and achieves the widest operation range of 33.4 
minutes among its predecessors.

with Ts signal after some oscillations. At the phase 
coincidence, the input time width can be calculated as 
inT n T= Δ ,                                     (1) 
where n and ΔT are the number of oscillations before phase 
coincidence and the difference between Ts and Tf respectively. 
Since the resolution ΔT equals the period difference, it can be 
made extremely fine even with low operation frequencies. 
However, the measurement range is limited to one Ts. If the 
TDC operation is reversed as depicted in Fig. 1(b), the vernier 
principle can be applied likewise to high accuracy DTC. Both 
Ts and Tf signals oscillate continuously with small period 
difference ΔT. After the phase coincidence of Ts and Tf, each 
oscillation will add one more ΔT delay between Ts and Tf 
signals. If Tf and Ts signals are programmed to oscillate n 
cycles to activate Start and Stop signals correspondingly after 
phase coincidence, the width of output interval can also be 
derived as 
outT n T= Δ ,                                    (2) 
which is exactly proportional to the input value n and 
successfully fulfills the function of digital-to-time conversion. 
It deserves noticing that the width of output interval is no 
longer limited to one Ts since no restriction is imposed on the 
value of n which can be set to any value as required. However,

counter was adopted to count the oscillations of the activated 
Ts signal until Stop signal arrived. Then the other fine counter 
was stimulated to count the racing oscillations between Tf and 
Ts signals before the phase coincidence. The input time width 
was derived as ( )in coarse fine s s f sT T T T T T T Tα β α β= + = + − = + Δ ,     (3) 
where α and β represent the counting values of the coarse and 
fine counters accordingly. The operation principle can also be 
reversely applied to DTC for output latency reduction as 
depicted in Fig. 2(b) where CNTf and CNTs represent the 
down counters clocking by Tf and Ts signals respectively to 
count the cycles before setting Start and Stop signals. After 
phase coincidence, both counters start counting and the first β 
cycles of Tf and Ts signals are used to generate βΔT delay 
difference between Start and Stop signals. Then, CNTs is 
allowed to count extra α cycles for producing additional αTs

Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of the proposed DTC 
which realizes the digital-to-time conversion function 
described in Fig. 2(b). Since the rise edges of Ts and Tf signals 
can be synchronized to that of Tref signal by phase-locked
