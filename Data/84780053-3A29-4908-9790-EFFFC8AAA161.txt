They found that the groove location of a 
journal bearing affects the pressure 
distribution in the fluid film and its 
dynamic performance. 
   It is well known that rub-impact 
often exists or occurs between the contact 
surface of rotor and stator in rotating 
machineries. The rub-impact force will lead 
friction and increase temperature 
eventually. The whole rotor-bearing system 
will finally corrupt and may be failed to 
operate. Therefore is will cause significant 
damage for designing or operating 
rotor-bearing system. 
There have been many publications on this 
problem and relevant topics. Muszynska 
[13] may be the first researcher take a very 
comprehensive study about this problem 
and the contribution for analyzing 
dynamics of rotating machineries is also 
very significant. Goldman and Muszynska 
[14] presented a research paper about 
discussing the rotor-to-stator rub inducing 
thermal effects and rotor-dynamic 
responses. They emphasized that heat will 
be generated while rotor-stator-rub happen. 
Piccoli and Weber [15] took an experiment 
of rub-impact force occurring between 
rotor and stator, and they found chaotic 
motions existing in the system. Dai et al. 
[16] analyzed the dynamic responses of 
rotor rubbing with a motion-limiting stop. 
Feng and Zhang [17] found some vibration 
phenomena of a rotor rubbing with a stator 
caused by initial perturbation. Edwards et 
al. [18] studied the rubbing phenomenon of 
rotors and stators and the rubbing-induced 
torsion in rotating machinery. Al-Bedoor 
[19] analyzed a model coupling with 
torsion and lateral vibrations with rubbing 
effect between rotor and stator. Wang and 
Chu [20] performed an experiment 
combining the acoustic emission method 
and wavelet transforms to determine the 
locations of rubbing in the rotary system. 
Chang-Jian and Chen [21-23] modeled a 
rotor supported by oil-film journal bearings 
and also considered the rub-impact force 
between rotor and stator. They found very 
abundant non-periodic motions occurring 
in this system, inclusive of chaotic 
responses. It demonstrated that the 
consideration of rub-impact effect and 
nonlinear suspension effect in rotor-bearing 
system are very important. 
The contribution of those studies is also 
very significant and great for rotating 
machineries. The fluid film force, bearing 
clearance, rotor-stator rubbing and other 
effects induced the nonlinear dynamic 
response of rotor-bearing system for those 
studies. Therefore those studies indeed help 
the design and improvement for modern 
industry and academic researches. Most of 
the formal researches about dynamic 
response of rotor-bearing system simplified 
whole rotor-bearing system in rotating 
machinery as a rotor supported by two 
bearings and they didn’t take multi-rotors 
into consideration. The simplification of 
the dynamic motions of the traditional 
rotor-bearing system may cause some 
errors in numerical simulation comparing 
with the multi- rotors-bearings system, but 
it would be very difficult and inconvenient 
discussing the dynamic orbits of all the 
 4
nonlinear dynamic equations, the 
dimensionless type should also be 
performed. The nonlinear dynamic 
response of this system varied with 
rotational speed ratio (s) and other 
dimensionless parameters would also be 
presented and discussed in this study. 
 
2.2 Long Bearing Approximation

the first 800 revolutions are not used for 
dynamic behavior investigation to 
guarantee that the data used are for a steady 
state. These data are then used to generate 
the dynamic trajectories, Poincaré maps 
and bifurcation diagrams. The maximum 
Lyapunov exponent method is also applied 
to identify the onset of chaotic motion.  
 
3.  Numerical studies 
 
The fourth order Runge-Kutta method 
is applied to carry out the numerical 
analysis. In this study, the time step for the 
calculation is π/300 and the error tolerance 
is less than 0.0001. The time series data of 
the first 800 revolutions are not used for 
dynamic behavior investigation to 
guarantee that the data used are for a steady 
state. These data are then used to generate 
the dynamic trajectories, Poincaré maps 
and bifurcation diagrams. The maximum 
Lyapunov exponent method is also applied 
to identify the onset of chaotic motion. 
Some parameters are specified for different 
cases in Table.1, 2 and 3. 
 
 Dynamic Trajectories and Poincaré 
Section  
 The dynamic trajectories can only be 
used to distinguish whether the system is 
periodic or non-periodic and it can not 
provide enough information to determine 
the onset for chaotic motion. Therefore the 
usage of other analytical methods is 
necessary. The Poincaré section is a 
hyper-surface in the state space transverse 
to the flow of a given system. In 
non-autonomous systems, points on the 
Poincaré section represent the return 
points of the time series at a constant 
interval T, where T is the driving period of 
the exciting force. The projection of a 
Poincaré section on the 1 1( ) ( )x nT y nT− , 
2 2( ) ( )x nT y nT− , 3 3( ) ( )x nT y nT−  and 
4 4( ) ( )x nT y nT−  planes are referred to as 
the Poincaré map of the dynamic system. 
For quasi-periodic motion, the returns 
points in the Poincaré map form a closed 
curve. For chaotic motion, the return 
points in the Poincaré map form a 
particular structure or many irregular 
points. For nT-periodic motion, the return 
points in the Poincaré map are n discrete 
points.  
 Bifurcation Diagrams 
A bifurcation diagram provides a 
summary of the essential dynamics of the 
rotor-bearing system and is therefore a 
useful way of observing non-linear 
dynamic responses. To generate a 
bifurcation diagram, the rotor speed ratio 
(s) is varied with a constant step and the 
state variables at the end of one integration 
step are used as the initial values for the 
next step. The variations of the 1( )x nT , 
1( )y nT , 2 ( )x nT , 2( )y nT  , 3( )x nT , 3( )y nT  , 
4 ( )x nT and 4( )y nT  coordinates of the 
return points in the Poincaré map with the 
speed ratio are then plotted to form the 
bifurcation diagram. 
 Lyapunov exponents 
The dynamic characteristics describe 
the dynamic properties of nearby 
trajectories in phase space. Due to 
dynamics, the points of nearby trajectories 
of a chaotic system starting inside a sphere 
 8
may be suitable for lower speed rotating 
speed machineries. The difference between 
case1 and case3 is the mass of rotor and 
bearing. The results show that it doesn’t 
affect the dynamic orbits very obviously. 
The difference between case1, case4 and 
case6 is the length of shaft1, shaft2 and 
shaft3. The length of shaft2 is shorter than 
other shafts in case1, the length of shafts 
increase progressively in case4 and the 
length of shaft1 and shaft3 are longer than 
shaft2 in case6. The bifurcation results 
show that it is just periodic motion or 
2T-periodic motion in case4 and case6 and 
therefore we can conclude that the 
designing for rotor-bearing under case4 and 
case6 will help system more stable than 
case1, especially the non-periodic motions 
will no more exist. The bearing-1 clearance 
is not the same as bearing-2 clearance of 
case1, but they are the same in case7. The 
difference between dynamic trajectories 
shown in bifurcation maps in case1 and 
case7 are also unapparent. From the above 
analysis, there are many designing 
parameters will affect the whole dynamic 
responses of rotor and bearing and the 
consideration of all significant parameters 
will help the dynamic responses of 
rotor-bearing more stable. 
Figs. 19 and 20 are Lyapunov exponent 
diagrams for s=5.1(case1) and s=2.2(case5), 
respectively. To verify strongly that the 
onset of chaotic motion at s=5.1(case1) and 
s=2.2(case5), the Lyapunov exponent 
diagram is also proposed to ensure chaos 
happens. All that results of the maximum 
Lyapunov exponent of Figs. 19 and 20 are 
positive and it means that dynamic orbits 
are unstable, indicating that it is chaotic 
under those parameters. Comparing the 
above results of the figures of dynamic 
trajectories, Poincaré section, bifurcation 
diagrams and Lyapunov exponents, it is 
found that the results are corresponding 
one another. 
 
3.2 Numerical Results for Long Bearing 
Approximation 
Fig.21 represent the bifurcation 
diagrams for given parameters in case1 
(Table 2). Periodic orbits are found at low 
speed and the dynamic trajectories in the 
horizontal and vertical directions are not 
synchronous for bearings or rotors. As 
speed is increased, the non-periodic 
responses occur. It remains irregular 
between s = 1.12~2.45, and the 
non-periodic motions may be 
quasi-periodic or even chaotic motions. 
The irregularity terminate at s>2.45 but the 
jump phenomenon occurs at s = 3.2. Then 
the periodic orbits are observed at s>3.2. 
They remain regular until s≧3.75, i.e. high 
rotating speed, the periodic motions 
disappeared and the non-periodic motions 
again occur. The amplitudes of aperiodic 
responses occurring at s = 1.12~2.45 for 
geometric center of bearing-2 in the 
vertical direction are particular larger than 
other bearing, rotors or directions. The 
dynamic responses for bearing-1 and 
bearing-2 are not synchronous, and so are 
the rotor-1 and rotor2. In order to study the 
difference of non-periodic responses for 
different parameters or cases, I compare the 
dynamic motions of different cross 
sectional area and length of shaft, and mass 
of rotors by means of applying bifurcation 
 10
responses between long bearing 
assumption and short bearing assumption, 
the nonlinear simulation for rotor-bearing 
system under short bearing assumption is 
presented. The initial conditions and 
parameters are defined as case1 for long 
bearing assumption, except the bearing 
ratio (length/diameter) is 0.24 (L/D=1, for 
long bearing) and nonlinear oil film force 
calculations. The motions under short 
bearing assumptions show that they are 
periodic at low speed, 2T-periodic at 
s>2.41 and become irregular at high speed, 
i.e. s>5.1. 
 
3.3 Numerical Results for Short Bearing 
Approximation with Rub-impact 
Effect 
Figs. 29 to 35 show the bifurcation 
diagrams of geometric center of the 
bearing-1, bearing-2, rotor-1 and rotor-2 in 
the horizontal and vertical directions under 
different cases (Table 3) and Fig. 36 is the 
bifurcation diagram describing dynamic 
responses of the geometric center of 
bearing and rotor with case1, but the initial 
conditions are different. The bifurcation 
results reveal that the dynamic motions of 
those cases will be quite different from the 
comparison of those cases. The difference 
of parameters of case1, case2 and case5 is 
the diameters of shaft1, shaft2 and shaft3. 
The diameter of shaft2 is greater than other 
shafts of case1, the cross section of shaft of 
case2 increase progressively (d1=11mm; 
d2=22mm; d3=33mm) and diameter of 
shaft2 is smaller than other shafts of case5. 
Judging from the bifurcation maps of case1, 
case2 and case5, it will never help the 
whole system to be more stable in case2. 
There are very large range in non-periodic 
and the dynamic responses become 
non-periodic at low speeds in case2. It 
should be emphasized that non-periodic 
motions are the undesired responses, 
especially at low speeds and it should be 
avoided. The dynamic response will be 
2T-periodic motions at s=2.4~4.8 in case1 
and then it will become unstable and 
non-periodic. It is non-periodic at 
s=0.8~1.4 and 2.8~3.4 is case2 and it is 
aperidoic at s=2.1~3.2. The simulation 
results tell us that different diameters of 
shaft will cause quite different dynamic 
responses in systems. The whole 
rotor-bearing systems designing and 
operating for engineers may refer these 
data to escape the undesired motions. For 
instance, we may choose case1 for very 
high operating speed to escape 
non-periodic motions. The difference 
between case1 and case3 is the mass of 
rotor and bering. The results show that it 
doesn’t affect the dynamic orbits very 
obviously and it can be concluded that 
mass may not the significant factor 
affecting dynamic responses. The 
difference between case1, case4 and case6 
is the length of shaft1, shaft2 and shaft3. 
Different lengths will make different 
stiffness of shaft. The length of shaft2 is 
shorter than other shafts in case1, the 
length of shafts increase progressively in 
case4 and the length of shaft1 and shaft3 
are longer than shaft2 in case6. The 
dynamic motions are just periodic motion 
or 2T-periodic motion in case4 and case6; 
in other words, the dynamic responses are 
stable in case4 and case6 than case1.
