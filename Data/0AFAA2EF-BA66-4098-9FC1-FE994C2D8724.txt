An algorithm for calculation the detonability limits and the existence region of a steady 
detonation wave in the gas-chemically inert microparticles mixture with different mass 
fraction of condensed phase is proposed. The limits of detonation wave in 
methane-oxygen gaseous mixture with SiO2 microparticles are calculated. Results of 
calculations correspond to the available experimental data. 
 
In collaboration with Russian participants of the Project the unsteady interaction of 
gaseous detonation wave with cloud of particles and evolution of the wave structure 
inside and behind of it is calculated numerically. Different modes of detonation wave 
propagation have been analyzed and critical parameters of the cloud, which are necessary 
for successful quenching of detonation, are calculated.  
 
The main results, obtained in the frames of the Project, were published (both in English 
and in Russian) in articles [1-4], monograph [5], Proceedings of International 
Conferences [6, 7] and were presented in National First University of Science and 
Technology, Taiwan, Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Siberian Branch of 
Russian Academy of Sciences and Novosibirsk State University of Architecture and Civil 
Engineering, Novosibirsk, Russia. This report summarized the important results from the 
joint research work. 
 
Keywords：detonation, explosion suppression, gas-particle two-phase flow

Fig. 1. Scheme of suppression of the DW by means of injecting chemically inert 
particles. 
 
We use the critical condition for propagation of the multifront DW in the form a = πD, 
where a is the detonation cell width, D is the tube diameter. For estimations of H and M 
we assume that L  3F, F = 3a, where L is the size of the cloud after compression in DW, 
F is the distance between the leading shock front and C.-J. plane. The higher the ratio 
a/ap, the smaller the total mass of particles which should be injected for DW suppression 
(index “P” corresponds to a gas without particles).  
 
The formulas for calculation M = M(α, a, ud, usw) and H =H(a, ud, usw) have been 
proposed. Here  is the mass fraction of particles, ud and usw are DW velocity and 
velocity of the mixture behind shock front. These formulas can be used if the values of α, 
a and C.-J. parameters of DW, corresponding to the critical conditions of wave 
propagation, are calculated. 
 
To calculate the detonation cell size in gas-particles mixtures, the corresponding formula, 
presented in [8] for gaseous mixtures, was used. According to the formula, the detonation 
cell size depends on DW velocity and parameters of the flow behind the leading shock 
front. From this formula, the following equation have been used: 
/ ( , / , / , / )
P P PP a D D SW SW SW SWa a f E u u T T  , where Ea is the activation energy of 
Arrhenius formula for induction period of chemical reaction, TSW and SW are temperature

2. Chapman-Jouguet Parameters and Detonation Cell Size in 
the Gas-Particles Mixture 
 
2.1 The model of DW in gas-particles mixture 
 
We use the following assumptions to describe the steady one dimensional DW in the 
two-phase mixture. The gas is ideal and condensed phase is incompressible. The particles 
are in mechanical and thermal equilibrium with the gas (the gas and the particles have an 
identical velocity and temperature). The partial pressure, the total volume of the particles, 
and the pressure of the saturated vapors of the condensed phase are negligibly small. DW 
structure corresponds to the Zel’dovich–von Neumann–Doering model. The gas in 
Chapman-Jouget (C.-J.) plane is in chemical equilibrium. The losses due to friction and 
heat transfer to the tube walls are ignored. 
 
The closed system of algebraic equations of mass, momentum, energy, state, chemical 
equilibrium and C.-J. condition are used. The variables of the system are: pressure, 
density and molar mass of gas, velocity and temperature of the mixture in C.-J. plane and 
velocity of the wave. Thermodynamic parameters of gas-particles mixture are calculated 
by algebraic formulas, presented in the frames of the current project. At α = 0 the system 
of equation transforms to the system of equations that were successfully used in our 
previous work [11] for calculating the parameters of DW in gas without particles. 
 
To calculate parameters of the flow behind the leading DW front the closed system of 
algebraic equations of mass, momentum, energy and state are used. The variables of the 
system are: pressure, density, velocity and temperature of the mixture.  
 
2.2 The model of chemical equilibrium in mixture of a gas with chemically 
inert microparticles

parameters in the CJ plane (stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen mixture) are shown in Fig. 3. 
The flow parameters behind of the leading shock front of the wave and detonation cell 
size are shown in Fig. 4.

3. DW Reflection From a Rigid Wall in Mixtures of a Gas with 
Chemically Inert Micro-Particles 
 
The following questions were under consideration. Is it possible to reduce an impact of 
DW on the wall by the particles injection and therefore prevent crucial destruction of 
equipment, caused by detonation? How additions of the particles influence on pressure 
and temperature behind a reflected wave? What is the influence of thermodynamic 
parameters of particles on wall pressure and temperature loading? 
 
A problem of DW reflection from a rigid wall in gas/chemically inert particles mixtures is 
considered in the frames of the following scenario (Fig. 6). A steady one-dimensional 
DW with constant Chapman-Jouguet parameters behind the leading front impacts a rigid 
wall. As a result, reflected wave occurs. The gaseous phase behind the reflected wave 
front is in state of chemical equilibrium. Such kind of reflection in gaseous mixtures 
called D → D reflection. The same term for DW reflection in gas/particles mixtures is 
used here. Note, that the problem of D → D reflection for gaseous mixtures is known 
since a many years and can be calculated now in the frames not only scientific, but 
commercial engineering programs as well. But similar problem for gas/chemically inert 
particles mixtures is considered for the first time only in the frames of present Project.

4. DW Suppression by Particles Injection: the Influence of Gas 
Composition 
 
Based on the algorithm and computer code, developed in the frames of the Report, 
parameters and relative cell size of steady DW in cyclohexane/oxygen mixture with 
Al2O3 micro-particles are calculated. Different mass fractions of condensed phase and 
different relation between fuel and oxidizer are considered. Such type of calculation is 
performed for the first time. 
 
Results of calculations are shown in Fig. 8-10 (η is the molar fraction of the fuel in gas). 
As can be seen from Fig. 10, at fixed concentration of particles, the value a/a0 has a 
minimum. Such minimum corresponds to fuel rich mixture. For example, if α = 0.5, then 
a/a0 has minimum at η = 0.1625 (stoichiometric mixture corresponds to η = 0.1). If 
concentration of fuel decreases relatively this concentration, then a/a0 increases. It is 
means that efficiency of DW suppression by particles injection increases too. For 
example, if η decreases from 0.1625 to 0.05, then a/a0 increases more than in 2 times 
(from 0.1625 to 3.68). If concentration of fuel increases relatively the concentration, 
which corresponds to the minimum value of a/a0, then a/a0 increases too. But such effect 
is not so essential. 
 
Calculations of wave parameters and relative cell size have been performed for η ≤ 0.25. 
If η > 0.25, then concentration of soot in detonation products is not negligible small, and 
computer code for calculations needs to be modified.

5. Detonability Limits of Detonation Waves in Gas/Chemically 
Inert Particles Mixtures 
 
The detonation limits are very important safety characteristics of explosion systems. For 
mixture of explosive gas with chemically inert microparticles such limits depend not only 
on chemical composition of the gas, but on mass fraction of condensed phase too. 
 
How the detonability limits depend on the mass fraction of the condensed phase? Such 
question was not under any theoretical investigations up to now. And this problem is 
analyzed in the frames of the present Project for the first time. 
 
The algorithm for estimation the detonability limits in gaseous mixtures is well known 
(see, for example, [14]). For this purpose it is necessary to use equation Pa D  
(critical condition of multi-front detonation wave propagation in a tube) and the 
dependence of detonation cell size aP on chemical composition of the gas: 
(% )P Pa a fuel . 
 
This algorithm can be used for calculation the existence region of DW in the gas-particles 
mixtures too. For this purpose, equation a D  and the value of detonation cell size as 
a function of chemical composition of the mixture and mass fraction of the condensed 
phase  should be used: (% , )a a fuel  . 
 
As an example, detonability limits in methane-oxygen mixture with SiO2 microparticles 
are considered. The algorithm for calculation C.-J. parameters and relative cell size, 
presented in the frames of the Project, is used. Results of calculations of the relative cell 
size as a function of the chemical composition of the mixture and mass fraction of the 
condensed phase are shown in Fig. 11. Detonation cell size in pure methane-oxygen 
gaseous mixture can be found in [15]. Figure 11, article [15] and equation 
(% , )a a fuel   allow us to calculate the detonation limits in the heterogeneous mixture 
under consideration (Fig. 12). Results of calculations quite good correspond to the 
 25
existence region of detonation wave. D = 16.4 mm, P0 = 1 atm, T0 = 298 K.

So, if cloud length is less than critical, then DW suppression by cloud of particles is not 
observed.

Scope and Purpose of CGA G-13
 Addresses the hazards in handling 
silane
 Covers storage, use and cylinder 
filling facilities
 Prescribes controls for installation of 
silane systems
 Recommends methods for storage & 
transfer of silane
 Provides guidance for siting, design 
of equipment, safety systems & 
installation of silane storage and
gas delivery/filling systems
 Provides guidance on operational 
steps
 Does NOT cover user facilities and 
gas distribution after the gas 
cabinets or VMB’s
3
History of CGA Silane Standard
 Long history going back to 1994 when the first 
meetings were held to develop a silane standard.
 Bulk silane release testing in 1996 was part of the 
development effort
 Originally adopted by CGA as P-32 in 2000
 This was reviewed under the ANSI process. Over a 
1000 comments were submitted of which 300 were 
substantial, requiring additional work. Adopted and 
approved in 2006 as ANSI/CGA G13
4
CGA G13 Revision
 When P-32 was developed in 1999 very few ISO’s 
and bulk installations existed.
 Since then the use of bulk silane has increased 
substantially (> 500 ISO)
 CGA created a committee to review and revise G13 
based on comments received from EIGA, AIGA and 
JIMGA. First teleconference Nov 12, 2008
 Participants from
 Gas Suppliers (Praxair, Air Products, Linde, Matheson)
 Manufacturer (REC Silicon)
 Users (Micron, ST Micro, On Semi)
 Associations (ICC)
 Insurance (FM Global)
5
G13 Setback Distance Task Force
The committee established a Setback Distance 
task force in 2008 to review the original basis 
for the setback distances
Proposed removal of PRD by reviewing
 Incidents
 Industry statistics
 Fault Tree
 Risk Assessment
 In 25 years of silane filling no incidents of a full 
flow PRD release and a sudden overpressure 
event. This event is unlikely and is estimated to 
be 5.7 x 10-6
6
Silane PRD Leaker
 Leak on fire can very quickly develop into a full PRD 
discharge. The cylinder cap acts as an oven, melting 
the remaining fuse metal
 The flames impinging onto an adjacent silane 
cylinder can cause that PRD to also activate 
(domino affect)
 Many gas suppliers reported incidents where 
multiple cylinders of silane were vented

Conclusions
Heat flux from silane flame is stronger than 
ethylene, but the solid product may form a 
protective layer to reduce the heat 
absorption into nearby cylinder
Overpressure from large cylinder leak is 
significant, and will be the dominant factor 
in determining the set back distance
