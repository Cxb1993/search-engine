where pNNL  is the scrambling symbols via 
precoding matrix, and pN  is extra used symbols that ranges 
from 0 to N .

 As the overhead  in precoding matrix increases, the PAPR 
value can be efficiently minimizes. 
B. Mu-Law Companding Technique 
A Mu-Law companding technique utilizes Mu-Law 
algorithm companding transform by compressing the peak 
signals and enlarging the small signals for reducing PAPR. An 
OFDM transmitter based on Mu-Law companding is depicted 
in Fig.2.

Fig. 3  Block diagram of the combination of precoding and Mu-Law 
companding scheme in the OFDM transmitter. 
 
In this section, a combinative scheme is proposed by using 
precoding and Mu-Law companding techniques for reducing 
PAPR. An OFDM transmitter combines precoding approach in 
frequency domain with Mu-Law companding scheme in time 
domain is shown in Fig.3.  
Let C , denoted  T1-K210 ,,, ccccC  is modulating 
symbols on K  data subcarriers after the process of signal 
constellation mapping. The vector D  is obtained by precoder

V. CONCLUSION 
The proposed approach, that combines the advantage of 
precoding and μ -law companding method, has significant 
results in PAPR reduction.  Although the opportunities for high 
PAPR signals are significantly reduced by selects a large 
L and μ , the OOB emission may be a potential problem. 
Therefore, the proposed scheme, which chooses proper pN  in 
precoding matrix and μ  in Mu-Law parameter, gives 
flexibility both in terms of PAPR reduction and OOB emission 
suppression.
