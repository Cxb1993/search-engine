Adav et al., 2007a). Formation by self 
immobilization of bacteria as hypothesized by 
several researchers (Kim et al., 2004; McSwain et al., 
2004a; Qin et al., 2004a, b; Wang et al., 2004; Hu et 
al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005), the aerobic granules were 
densely packed microbial aggregates and their 
densities were much higher than that of conventional 
activated sludge. In addition, the aerobic granules 
were known to exhibit attributes of:  
(1) Regular, smooth and nearly round in shape  
(2) Excellent settleability  
(3) Dense and strong microbial structure  
(4) High biomass retention  
(5) Ability to withstand at high organic loading  
(6) Tolerance to toxicity  
Because of the unique granule attributes, the aerobic 
granulation technology was recently developed for 
treating high-strength wastewaters containing 
organics, nitrogen, phosphorus, toxic substances and 
xenobiotics (Jiang et al., 2002; Moy et al., 2002; Tay 
et al., 2002b; Lin et al., 2003; Adav et al., 2007a-d, 
Adav and Lee, 2008a).  
Recent development in aerobic 
biogranulation technology is now reviewed and 
presented in this paper. Materials covered by 
existing reviews are not duplicated herein. Factors 
affecting granulation, granule characterization, 
granulation hypotheses, effects of different 
operational parameters on aerobic granulation, 
response of aerobic granules to different 
environmental conditions, their applications in 
bioremediations, and possible future trends are 
delineated. Applications in treating municipal and 
toxic industrial wastewaters as well as useful 
information on exploring the underlined mechanisms 
are also highlighted. 
 
 
結果與討論 
EPS and granule stability 
One of the most serious barriers to practical 
applications of aerobic granules was the loss of 
stability of aerobic granules over long-term 
operation. Two different patterns were noted: 
granule break-up and filament overgrowth (Liu and 
Liu, 2006; Adav et al., 2007b, Zhu et al., 2008). For 
the former, the granules deteriorated into small 
pieces to flow out with the upflow liquid stream. For 
the latter, the outgrown filaments produced light and 
bulky granules for easy washout. Also, the filaments 
tended to block the pipelines that led to failed 
reactors. Long term operation was not possible 
without stable granules.  
An example of the EPS and cell distributions 
in phenol-fed granule is shown (Fig 1). The 
β-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides formed the core, 
while the cells and α-D-glucopyranose 
polysaccharides accumulated in the granule outer 
layers along with lipids. Wang et al. (2005b) applied 
only one dye, calcofluor white, to their granules and 
determined that non-soluble β-polysaccharide 
formed the outer shell of aerobic granules to provide 
its strength. Conversely, McSwain et al. (2005) 
stained their granules using 
fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC), concanavalin A 
(Con A) lectin conjugates and SYTO 63, to probe 
the content distribution of proteins, 
α-polysaccharides and cells in the granules. These 
authors and Zhang et al. (2007) argued that a 
non-cellular protein core in aerobic granule provided 
its stability. Based on the results by Chen et al. 
(2007a), the Wang’s and McSwain’s groups in fact 
highlighted only part of the whole story (Fig. 1). 
Staining technique should be used with caution.  
Adav et al. (2007d) selectively hydrolyzed 
proteins, α-, β-polysaccharides, and lipids using 
enzymes and determined the stability change 
following hydrolysis. These authors noted that, 
although protein was redundant at the core regime, 
the selective removal of proteins had minimal 
impacts on the structural stability of granules. 
Conversely, hydrolysis of β-polysaccharides caused 
granules’ disintegration. The updated view was: the 
granule structure was stabilized by a network 
principally composed of β-polysaccharides as the 
backbone for embedded proteins, lipids, 
α-polysaccharides, and cells. Hence, enrichment of 
certain (not all) EPS assisted granulation, and 
enhanced granule stability. Such a conclusion was 
significant to enhance granule stability during 
operation and to reduce granule loss in storage.  
Storage reduced granule stability (Tay et al., 
2002c; Zhu and Wilderer, 2003). Tay et al. (2002c) 
and Ng (2002) noted that the granules stored for 
eight weeks became more irregular and smaller 
compared to fresh granules and released soluble 
organic material due to cell hydrolysis. The 
glucose-fed granules cultivated by Zhu and Wilderer 
(2003) did not significantly change in size, color, or 
settleability after storage for seven weeks at room 
temperatures. Meanwhile, Zhu (2004) claimed that 
their granules remained stable even after storage for 
two years in tap water at an ambient temperature 
(16–26° C). This result was too good to be realized 
in practice. Adav et al. (2007f) concluded that 
phenol-fed aerobic granules could be preserved 
 3
1 Acinetobacter sp.) and found from the taxonomic 
analysis of all the strains reported for phenol 
biodegradation, more than 70% strains belong to 
Proteobacterium phyla.  
Adav and Lee (2008b) cultivated granules 
with a single strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, 
which exhibited a high autoaggregation potential 
with interconnecting fibrils (Fig. 2). Seed sludge 
with enriched Acinetobacter strains could form the 
granules faster than the sludge dominated by 
non-flocculating microbial strain. The 
auto-aggregating bacterial strains enhanced the 
granulation process (Adav and Lee, 2008b, Jiang et 
al., 2006). The single-culture granules cultivated 
with Acinetobacter calcoaceticus degraded phenol at 
a rate of 9930 mg g-1VSS d-1, significantly higher 
than that of activated sludge and of other aerobic 
granular sludge (Tay et al., 2005a; Watanabe et al., 
1996). The different process performances noted 
with the mixed-culture granules revealed the 
difficulty in precise control of the dominant strains 
in the granules, partly because of the presence of 
inhibiting strains. The single-culture granules could 
be biologically precise for engineered systems. The 
strains Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacillus 
thuringiensis and Acinetobacter sp. were both 
phenol degraders and autoaggregators, and were 
capable of forming granules individually when 
inoculated separately in a SBR (Adav et al., 2008b). 
These findings contradicted the previous view that 
autoaggregation and phenol degradation were 
mutually exclusive in aerobic granules and proposed 
“trade off” functional model (Jiang et al., 2004b; 
Jiang et al., 2006). In single culture granule, only 
one strain existed and the specific phenol 
degradation rate could be higher than those from 
multi-strains due to a lack of inhibiting strains, 
antibacterial substance and growth inhibiting 
metabolites. The interactions of Candida tropicalis 
with Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacillus 
thuringiensis suggested that the strains coaggregated 
through the cell surface polymers by 
lectin-saccharide interactions with the adhesin 
protein on Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and 
complementary sugar receptors on B. thuringiensis 
and C. tropicalis (Adav et al., 2008b). The presence 
of flagellum on the B. thuringiensis and Bacillus 
sphaericus helped the nutrient current towards the 
granules as both these strain were found to locate on 
the surface of the granules.  
 
 
V. 結論 
Formation of granules in aerobic conditions 
has been possible and appears as a promising 
technique for high strength or highly toxic 
wastewater treatment. These granular systems 
allowed, in many cases, a more stable operation, and 
the treatment of larger loads, removal of multiple 
toxic pollutants, inferior volumes for the settling 
systems and production of better quality effluents 
than any conventional systems. The formation 
mechanisms and applications and certain recent 
efforts to explore this technology in depth has been 
presented. We also propose the following 
perspectives to the potential development of the 
aerobic granular sludge technology in the future.
