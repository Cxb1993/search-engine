2. Abstract 
A new low power wide locking range divide-by-3 injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) using a 
standard 0.13 μm CMOS process is presented. The push-push ILFD circuit is realized with a cross-coupled 
n-core MOS LC-tank oscillator with linear mixer to extend the locking range. The core power consumption of 
the ILFD core is 2.05 mW. The divider’s free-running frequency is tunable from 4.37 to 5.43 GHz by tuning 
the varactor’s control bias, and at the incident power of 0 dBm the maximum locking range is 2.6 GHz 
(16.5%), from the incident frequency 14.5 to 17.1 GHz. The operation range is 5.1 GHz (35.1%), from 12.0 to 
17.1 GHz. 
 
3. Introduction 
  CMOS LC-tank injection-locked frequency dividers (ILFD) recently have received a lot of attention 
because they can operate at high frequency and low power consumption, and they are often used as the key 
components in fully-integrated RF systems. However, low power consumption is obtained at the expense of a 
narrow locking range due to a low voltage swing. High-modulus ILFDs can be used to reduce circuit 
complexity and power consumption, and division ratios higher than two can be obtained by making use of 
higher order harmonics generated by nonlinearity of MOSFETs. Due to the weak higher order harmonics 
generated by MOSFETs compared to divide-by-2 operation, the locking range decreases significantly as the 
modulus increases. 
  A conventional divide-by-3 ILFD uses two series [1-3] or parallel [4, 5] injection transistors; the injection 
transistors are used as nonlinear mixers and the locking range is generally narrow. Attempt to use two linear 
mixers in series in divide-by-3 ILFD has been reported [6] recently. This paper proposes a wide-locking range 
divide-by-3 push-push ILFD with a single-stage linear mixer in addition to the existing nonlinear mixer. At 
the incident power of 0 dBm the maximum locking range is 2.6 GHz (16.5%), from the incident frequency 
14.5 to 17.1 GHz. This is the highest locking range percentage at low power. The low power is obtained by 
using an inductive gate boosting technique so that the drain-source voltage can be reduced. 
 
4. Circuit Design 
   The proposed divide-by-3 circuit shown in Fig. 1 is composed of a cross-coupled n-core VCO with a 
resonator consisting of a pair of varactors Cvar and inductors L1 and L2. The varactors are used for frequency 
tuning. The voltage Vtune is used to tune the capacitance of MOS varactors and the oscillation frequency. The 
inductors L3 and L4 are used to increase the voltage swing [7] at the gates of mixers (M1, M2) so that a low 
supply voltage can be used to lower the power consumption. One level of transistors is used for low supply 
voltage. The injection MOSFETs are connected between the gates of cross-coupled transistors (M1, M2) and 
the common node of inductors L1 and L2. The injection signal is applied to the gates of (M3, M4) with dc gate 
bias Vinj. An external balun is used to convert a single-ended input from a signal source to a differential 
signal (Inj+, Inj-). Common source buffer amplifiers (M5, M6) are used for measurement. LB can be an 
integrated inductor and here it is the bonding wire. 
   Figure 2 shows the block diagram for a divide-by-3 ILFD. The input/output frequency relation is given by 
ωRF − 2ωo = ωo. ωRF is the frequency of injection signal and ωo is the frequency of ILFD output signal. In 
conventional divide-by-3 ILFD the ideal mixer and the multiplier  2 are generated by the nonlinearity of a 
mixer transistor. When LB in Fig. 1 is 0, the strength of the common source node voltage Vs of (M1, M2) is 
zero, and the injection MOSFETs (M3, M4) serve as the nonlinear mixers and the locking range is small.  
In the proposed ILFD shown in Fig. 1, LB is present and it serves as the load for the second harmonic 2ωo. 
The injection signals applied to the MOSFETs (M3, M4) are converted to the gate voltages of (M1, M2), which

linear mixer. Figure 4 shows the simulated voltage transients for the ILFD. The gate voltage swing of M1 is 
larger than the drain voltage swing of M2. The boosted gate voltage is used so that we can lower the 
drain-source voltage for lower power operation. 
 
5. Measurement Results of pre-stressed ILFD 
  The proposed ILFD was designed and fabricated in TSMC 0.13 μm CMOS technology. Figure 5 shows the 
micrograph of the 0.13 μm ILFD with chip area of 0.903 × 0.920 mm2. Four foundry-supplied symmetric 
3-turn octagonal inductors were used in the fabricated chip. To measure the locking range and phase noise 
performance of the ILFD, an Agilent 83752B signal source has been used with the Agilent E4407B spectrum 
analyzer. 
  Figure 6 shows the measured tuning curve by varying the varactor’s tuning voltage. The free-running 
frequency of the 0.13 μm ILFD is tunable from 4.37 to 5.43 GHz with a tuning voltage Vtune varied from 0 to 
1.3 V. With a supply voltage of 0.5 V, the current and power consumption of the ILFD core are 4.1 mA and

6. Conclusion 
A new LC oscillator based divide-by-3 injection-locked frequency divider has been proposed and 
fabricated in the TSMC 0.13 μm CMOS process. The proposed ILFD uses one level of transistors and the 
technique of inductive voltage boosting, so that the ILFD can operate at low supply voltage and low power. 
The proposed push-push ILFD uses one nonlinear injection mixer and one cross-coupled MOSFET as linear 
mixer, and the latter enhances the locking range. The present divide-by-3 ILFD has wider locking-range 
percentage than published divide-by-3 ILFDs.  The maximum locking range of 0.13 μm ILFD is from 14.5 
to 17.1 GHz at the injection power of 0 dBm.
