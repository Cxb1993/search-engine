1. Introduction 
Adequate measurement of the nearshore fluid motions and the geology of the 
beach response have been important research issues in the coastal engineering, they 
are also vital for various coastal management problems.  These measurements are 
however hampered by the logistical difficulty of maintaining in-situ instruments in the 
nearshore environment where bottom changes can bury or scour sensors.  As an 
alternative, time-lapse photography has been applied to a variety of nearshore 
problems due to the low expense and simple logistics of the technique.  For 
examples, Holman and Guza (1984) used one super-8 camera to provide synchronous 
runup measurements over a 1 km longshore distance, Holman and Lippmann (1987) 
used snapshots and ten-minute time averages from a 35 mm camera mounted on a 
tripod to study the nearshore bar system at Duck, NC. 
These earlier optical remote sensing techniques developed by Holman and 
Lippmann (1987) have been evolved into a network of video-based photography 
system called Argus.  The history and technical capabilities of Argus system is 
provided in a recent paper of Holman and Stanley (2007).  Briefly summarized, the 
Argus system has evolved from post-processing to automated-processing architectures, 
from black-and-white to color video signals, from analog to digital cameras, and from 
640 x 480 to 1024 x 768 pixel resolutions.  The Argus system has been adopted at 
 6 
focusing on the hydrodynamics and morphology of natural beaches have been 
successfully extended to address more complex environments and coastal 
management problems (Huntley and Stive, 2007). 
Other than the traditional image data, recent Argus sampling methods have been 
designed to return time series data from a selected small subset of pixels, called pixel 
instruments.  This strategy sharply reduces the amounts of returned data and at the 
same time provides useful information to measure waves and currents.  The pixel 
instruments summarized in Holman and Stanley (2007) include single pixel 
(estimating wave period), alpha array (estimating wave direction and directional 
spectrum), tess array (estimating dense spatial field of wave direction and directional 
spectra), bathy array (estimating bathymetry), runup array (estimating wave runup), 
and vbar array (estimating longshore current). 
To make scientific measurements from image data, the images must be rectified 
onto a map plane or space of world coordinates.  Rectification requires accurate 
transformation between image/world systems as well as accurate knowledge of the 
camera pointing parameters (azimuth, tilt, roll, field of view, etc.).  For 
two-dimensional applications, any point on an oblique image taken from the 
photography equipment can be transformed from its image coordinates to the 
horizontal world coordinates by spatial constraints or stereometric methods (Holland 
 8 
Xu and Prince (1998a) further generalized the GVF formulation to include two 
spatially varying weighting functions.  This generalized gradient vector flow (GGVF) 
model improves active contour convergence to long, thin boundary indentations while 
maintaining other desirable properties of GVF active contour model. 
The active contour model technique has been recently applied to water wave 
problems.  The classic active contour model was used by Duncan et al. (1999) to 
delineate the rapidly deforming crest profiles of spilling breakers in a wave tank.  
The GVF active contour model was applied by Yao and Wu (2005) to track sequential 
surface wave profiles of a spiller, a plunger, and a plunging breaker striking a vertical 
cylinder in a wave-current flume.  The applications of active contour models to 
water wave problems so far are limited to controllable wave tank experiments.  For 
imaging at a small field of view, light sheet converted from laser light beam is 
normally projected along the center vertical plane of the tank, while back-lighted 
techniques is usually arranged to illuminate the air-water interface for imaging a large 
field of view (Yao and Wu, 2005).  Fluorescein dyes with special absorption and 
emission wavelength are frequently used to sharpen the contrast at the air-water 
interface in these wave tank experiments.  The images obtained are two-dimensional 
planar with negligible distortion and need not to be rectified onto a map plane. 
Our objective in this study is to apply the active contour model in delineating

2. Mathematical description of Argus video techniques 
The fundamental principle of Argus video techniques can be found in Holland 
et al. (1997).  The following three sub-sections present those key elements of the 
techniques and several changes adopted in this paper. 
 
2.1. Direct linear transformation 
Fig. 1 is the definition sketch of space and image coordinate systems adopted in 
this paper.  Let ),,( zyx  represent the space coordinates of an object point O , and 
),,( ccc zyx  represent the space coordinates of optical projection center N .  A vector 
drawn from N  to O  becomes  ccc zzyyxx  ,, .  Let )0,,( vu  represent 
the image coordinates of the same object in a digitized image plane I , and )0,,( 00 vu  
represent image coordinates of the image plane center.  Since the image plane is at a 
distance f  (the effective focal length) from the projection center of the camera, the 
projection center can also be expressed as ),,( 00 fvu   in the image coordinate 
system.  A vector drawn from N  to I  becomes  fvvuu ,, 00  .  Under a 
distortion-free, pinhole camera model, points N , I , and O , are thus collinear. 
The collinearity condition is equivalent to the vector expression

     The undistorted image center coordinates ),( 00 vu  can be determined by a 
simple extrapolation from the predicted coordinates of adjacent control points.  The 
radial camera distortion coefficients are then determined by a best fit polynomial to 
the radial distance ijr  and radial distortion ijr  of all control points. 
The vertical conversion factor v  is typically set to a dimensionless 
normalized value of one since the effective focal length f  will be determined during

Expanding in terms of Taylor series and retaining only the first order terms 
yields

It is noted that these equations are slightly different from the corresponding equations 
in Holland et al. (1997) where the known image coordinates were erroneously 
included in the Taylor series.  The partial derivative coefficients ijkb  as listed in the 
Appendix of Holland et al. (1997) are also incorrect with several typo-errors.  The

same reference frame as illustrated in Fig. 3.  The horizontal and vertical distances 
between all neighboring ground control points were also calculated from all 
transformed images and an average error of 2.7 % was obtained with a total of 513 
segments. 
 
3. Mathematical description of GGVF active contour model  
A classic two-dimensional snake )}(),({)( sysxsC   is an elastic curve that 
dynamically deforms within an image domain toward features such as lines and edges 
by minimizing the following energy functional (Kass et al., 1988)

However the first term of Eq. 26 is neglected in numerical implementations of Xu and

it as function of time and solving the equilibrium solution of the following system of 
partial differential equations

4. Field test 
4.1. Experimental setup and data description 
    Fig. 4 illustrates the field site for this study.  This field site is located near the 
entrance of Kaohsiung Harbor located at the southwestern coast of Taiwan.  The 
sandy beach north of harbor breakwater, named Hsi-tzu bay (or Hsi-tzu-wan) beach, 
 24
ten-minute variance image.  This provides a feasible image identification model for 
submerged sand bars, rip channel topography and rip current system.  The long term 
topographic change of coastal area is also possible after the coast view data is 
accumulated.  During severe weather conditions, a ten-minute continuous sequence 
of images is also stored and analyzed by active contour model to study the shoaling 
transformation characteristics of nearshore wave patterns. 
The basic premise behind the video technique is that waves preferentially break 
over shallow features such as sand bars.  Breaking waves are seen as the 
discontinuous foam associated with individual breaker crests in snapshots while the 
integrated effect of the breaking waves yields a smooth white band in time average 
images, in clear contrast to darker regions of less wave breaking (Alexander and 
Holman, 2004).  For non-breaking waves, the individual wave crests are also seen as 
bright intensity sections in snapshots.  Since it is easy to identify the individual wave 
crests in snapshots taken from camera positioned on a higher ground looking in the 
longshore direction, the snapshots are ideal for incorporating with a suitable tracking 
model during the shoaling process. 
 
4.2. Traditional image data 
An example time average image prior to the typhoon season is shown in Fig. 6 
 26
4.3. Snake tracking data 
One apparent disadvantage of optical remote sensing in a field environment is 
that bad weather with heavy rainfalls would impede the acquisition of clear images.  
Two consecutive typhoons invaded Taiwan during the second week of August 2007, 
of which typhoon Pabuk landed on the southern peninsula of Taiwan on August 8.  
During typhoon passage the whole Hsi-tzu bay was covered with foams and 
whitecaps where the images acquired are not suitable for tracking purpose.  To 
illustrate the snake tracking of sequential nearshore wave crests in the shoaling 
process, we have selected some clear images on August 10 after typhoon Pabuk. 
The following example illustrates the snake tracking procedures in a snapshot.  
Four steps are required.  The first step is a pre-possessing step to calculate an edge 
map.  All the pre-possessing techniques employed in this study can be found in the 
textbooks of image processing and will not be elaborated in details in the following.  
Fig. 8 is the original image of a snapshot taken after typhoon Pabuk.  A total of eight 
wave crest profiles are clearly identified in this snapshot (in fact, between the farthest 
two profiles there is another wave crest which is not clearly identified by the 
following pre-possessing techniques).  This image is first converted to its gray-level 
image and then convolved with a Sobel mask in the vertical direction to obtain the 
gradient magnitude image as illustrated in Fig. 9.  This gradient magnitude image is 
 28
pre-possessing procedure.  The snapshot is first converted to its gray-level image and 
then smoothed with a binomial filter of order 2 (Fig. 12).  This smoothed image is 
convolved with gradient masks in both directions to obtain the gradient magnitude 
image.  A non-maxima suppression process is then applied and only pixels with 
locally maximal values of the gradient magnitude retain their values in the edge map 
as illustrated in Fig. 13.  A hysteresis thresholding process may be applied further in 
order to sharply define the edges, as illustrated in Fig. 14, which eliminates most 
high-intensity foams and whitecaps between the wave crests in the breaker zone.  It 
is noted that the width of each edge line in Figs. 13-14 only cover a single pixel and 
part of the edge line is broken.  Both edge maps in Figs. 13-14 can be used in the 
subsequent steps of snake tracking procedures.  The final snakes of wave crest 
profiles with unit width are overlaid in red color on the original snapshot as illustrated 
in Fig. 15 where the delineated snakes are tracked based on the edge map of Fig. 13. 
The following example illustrates the sequential snake tracking procedures.  A 
single pixel instrument is first used to determine the wave period by sampling 
intensity variations at 10 Hz from a set of sequential images.  The Fourier analysis 
yields a peak frequency of 0.1 Hz corresponding to a wave period of 10 s for the wave 
sequence.  A sub-set of these sequential images is then used where one particular 
snake (wave crest) is tracked for the following consecutive 50 s up to the swash zone 
 30
sequential images represent the shoaling evolution in time while the snake tracking 
results from a single snapshot represent the shoaling evolution in space. 
The wave directions and the wave phase speeds of the whole field may be 
estimated from the rectified map plane, where the wave phase speed is defined as the 
mean propagating velocity of a characteristic feature (wave crest profile) traveling 
between two cross-shore locations.  However there exist zigzag patterns of the wave 
crest profiles on the previous map plane of Fig. 16.  These zigzag patterns are caused 
by the increasing horizontal pixel resolutions in the offshore direction and the 
irregular wave crest profiles in the breaker zone.  The wave crest profiles are 
therefore smoothed further.  The results of the estimated wave directions and phase 
speeds are overlaid with these smoothed wave crest profiles on the rectified map 
plane and illustrated together in Fig. 17.  This rectified map plane represents a 
characteristic densely-spaced directional wave field of the studied area after typhoon 
Pabuk. 
 
5. Conclusions 
A generalized gradient vector flow active contour (snake) model is combined 
with the video techniques of Argus system to delineate and track sequential nearshore 
wave crest profiles in the shoaling process, up to their breaking on the shoreline.  
 32
while the more automated techniques generally produce secondary edge lines 
corresponding to wave trough profiles, high-intensity foams and whitecaps.  Since 
clear images is a prerequisite to the self-initialization algorithm for frame-to-frame 
sequential tracking, the tradeoff between automation in a single snapshot and 
sequential snapshots will be a research issue for further studies.  It is expected that 
situations may be different from case to case due to the variability encountered in the 
field experiments.  The accuracies and resolutions of the active contour model 
technique in the optical remote sensing of a nearshore environment, especially in the 
breaker zone, should be systematically studied in the future.
