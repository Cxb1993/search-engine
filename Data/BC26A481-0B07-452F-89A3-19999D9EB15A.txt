Abstract 
 
802.11p, also known as DSRC/WAVE, is a standard protocol intended for traffic systems in 
order to support safety and commercial non-safety applications for vehicular communication. 
802.11p is modified from 802.11a, and both are based on OFDM. The main difference between 
802.11a and 802.11p is that the latter is proposed to use 10 MHz frequency bandwidth (half of 
bandwidth of 802.11a) in order to make the signal more robust against fading and increase the 
tolerance for multipath propagation effects of signals in a vehicular environment.  
To enhance the commercial of DSRC, the service quality will be the top priority, passengers 
attach their mobile devices to an on-board Mobile Router (MR) which is connected to the Internet 
through various wireless access technologies. However, high packet loss rate and low bandwidth 
are commonly seen in a wireless environment. In prior work, a multi-homed NEMO architecture 
has been proposed to improve the reliability and aggregate the bandwidth by simultaneously using 
multiple wireless links, and is backward compatible with the TCP hosts in the Internet.  
In this work, we investigate the performance difference between 802.11a and 802.11p for 
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure communication through real-world experiments. We measure contact 
duration and losses of 802.11p and 802.11a in both LOS and NLOS environments. In addition, we 
investigate their throughput with different modulations over various distances between OBU and 
RSU to evaluate the feasibility of using rate adaptation for non-safety V-to-I applications. 
Moreover, to improve the DSRC quality of service for commercial applications in vehicular 
networks, we propose a novel protocol called MH-TCP (Multi-homed TCP) to improve the 
performance of TCP traffic for single connection over multiple wireless links. MH-TCP solves 
several performance issues that would happen in reality, and makes the commercial applications of 
DSRC-based vehicular networks more feasible and practicable.

1. 前言與目的 
To decrease the number of traffic accidents, the U.S. Federal Communication Commission 
(FCC) has allocated a 75MHz spectrum at 5.9GHz for vehicle-to-vehicle and 
vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. The proposed vehicular communication technology, 
known as the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), is currently being standardized by 
the IEEE [1][2]. Many major car manufacturers have responded positively, and are actively working 
together in bringing this promising technology into reality [3][4]. An IEEE 802.11 standard, called 
IEEE 802.11p [5], is designed as the basic model for DSRC, and can be used to provide safety and 
service applications for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in the vehicular environment. 
There are two basic types of nodes in a DSRC networks: an On Board Unit (OBU) is located on 
vehicles and acts as an IEEE 802.11 station, while a Road Side Unit (RSU) is deployed on the road 
side and serves as an IEEE 802.11 access point. WAVE (Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments) 
network can be operated in either infrastructure or ad-hoc modes. In the infrastructure mode, OBU 
accesses the network via WBSS (Wave Basic Service Set), which is consists of by OBUs and RSUs. 
The stations that create the WBSS to provide the service are called “providers,” while those joining 
the service are called “users”. In this work, we perform our experiments using DSRC short 
messages to send and receive packets. 
The performance of 802.11a for vehicular communication has been studied extensively in 
simulations as well as on various testbed. However, as far as we know, there very few studies have 
been performed to understand the performance of 802.11p in a real-life scenario. Theoretically, the 
PHY layer of IEEE 802.11p PHY is pretty similar to that of IEEE 802.11a. The important PHY 
parameters for both the protocols are listed in Table 1 [8][9]. In this work, we set out to evaluate the 
performance of the 802.11p for V-to-I communication as that of compared to 802.11a in a real-life 
situation. We want to understand if the performance of 802.11p matches the expectations that 
people have for it? Furthermore, wireless links generally have low bandwidth and are error-prone. 
Hence, using multiple DSRC links simultaneously is a solution to increase the reliability and the 
network throughput and will improve the DSRC-based vehicular network’s quality of service for 
business applications.

2. 文獻探討 
DSRC or, 802.11p, is an IEEE standard which provides enhancements to the physical (PHY) 
and medium access control (MAC) layers of 802.11a for vehicular communication. Many studies 
have proposed different wireless technologies for vehicle communications based on existing 
standardized wireless technologies, such as Infrared, GSM, DSRC, Wi-Fi, Wi-Max, Bluetooth, 
RFID, for communication under one umbrella for ITS [10]. 
The V-to-I architecture allows vehicles to communicate with some roadway infrastructure and 
can enable many promising ITS applications. For example, the speed and location of a vehicle to be 
transmitted to a central server directly or indirectly connected to the road side unit. This server will 
track the speed and location of all vehicles and will aggregate this data for ITS applications, such as 
3 
This is used to identify the packet comes from which link of the multi-homed MR. Further, the HA 
conducts network address translation (NAT) for the encapsulated packets. Therefore, the downlink 
traffic from corresponding host would be sent to the HA first. As uplink traffic, the HA encapsulates 
the packets of downlink traffic and sends to the MR. The above described the based operation how 
a multi-homed NEMO (NEtwork MObility) architecture can provide the ability of multihoming for 
TCP protocol.

3.1. Trace collection 
In this work, we use the IWCU from ITRI. The IWCU serial products are meant to provide 
V-to-V and V-to-I communication enabling ITS applications ranging from safety to infotainment, as 
shown in Table 2 [11]. We look at three performance metrics of 802.11p in our experiments: contact 
duration, loss distribution and throughput when different modulations are used. The scenarios and 
parameter settings are explained in the following three subsections.

3.1.1. Contact duration 
In this experiment, we measure how long a car can maintain a connection with the road-side 
unit (RSU) when it passes the unit. We define the contact duration as the longest interval between 
when the first packet was sent by the car and the time when the last packet was received by the 
road-side unit. We start the car at a position where it is out of the radio range of RSU, gradually 
increasing the car’s speed and achieving the desired speed at the ‘start’ point. The same speed is 
maintained from the ‘start’ to ‘end’ points. The distance between ‘start’ and ‘end’ is 200m, and the 
scenario is shown as in Figure 2.

experiments for 802.11p is 2.68%, even in the NLOS environment. Our results show that 802.11p is 
more robust against the multipath effect as compared to 802.11a, due to 802.11p has doubled its GI 
(1.6 us).

3.1.3. Measurements for different modulations of 802.11p 
Four different modulations are supported by 802.11p, namely BPSK (1/2), QPSK (1/2), 
16QAM (1/2), and 64QAM (3/4). Theoretically, their corresponding data rates are 3Mbps, 6Mbps, 
12Mbps, and 27Mbps, respectively. We measured the throughput of 802.11p based on different 
modulation schemes for various distances. We used 16 dbm as the transmission power level due to 
hardware limitations. The parameter settings are shown in Table 5.

To avoid the disturbance of passers-by and moving cars, we collected our measurements at 
midnight. We placed the 802.11p devices at a height of 3m on top of a pole. Finally, to understand 
the performance of 802.11p under different bit rates, we measure the throughput of 802.11p over 
various distances. Theoretically, different modulations have different sensitivity levels.  
The sensitivity level is defined as (1) where the SNRmin is the minimum SNR needed to obtain 
the wanted BER. A higher bit-rate requires a higher SNR; hence, the transmitted signal experiences 
degradation as the distance between the sender and receiver increases, as a receiver with a high 
bit-rate is not available to decode bits and this may introduce high bit error rate. As shown in Figure 
5 and Figure 6, the achievable throughput of 802.11p is significantly lower than its theoretical 
counterpart (here we use the log-normal path loss model to model the radio propagation and 
calculate the theoretical throughput), although their curves are quite similar. The highest achievable 
data rate using 64QAM is about 18M when the car is very close to the road side unit (< 25m).  The 
longest distance we can achieve with a throughput greater than 2M is 150m, when BPSK is 
employed. Such a distance and data rate might be sufficient to use the road-side unit as a gateway to 
the Internet and provide some Internet-based applications for the car.  In addition, we observe the 
variation of throughput becomes larger when we increase the data rate from BPSK to QAM, which 
is particularly obvious when the car and the road side unit are at a closer distance, as shown in 
Figure 6.

C.  Reordering in Heterogeneous Link 
Applying pure packet-level striping in a multi-homed NEMO architecture would incur low 
performance while the MR connects to the Internet through the heterogeneous links. The familiar 
wireless access technologies, such as 3.5G, WiMax etc, have different bandwidth which also means 
different links have different transmission delay. This results out-of-order packets to drop the 
performance in multi-homed environment. Even reordering would not introduce spurious 
retransmission and unnecessary cwnd reduction. It still can reduce the sending rate of the source 
leading to performance drop. Considering the behavior of flow control in TCP, transmitting the new 
data segments are always driven by the ACK segments being sent from corresponding host. In other 
words, the sending rate of the source host is affected by how fast the ACK segments arrive. In 
Figure 7, we assume each path already have their own maintained cwnd value in this example. The 
packet sending through path 2 is delayed by the late ACK reception due to out-of-order. Figure 8 
shows the case of transmission delay of path 1 is increased to 10 comparing to Figure 7. The 
queuing delay of the packets is raised, when the links become more heterogeneous. 
 
Figure 7: Data sending rate is reduced due to out-of-order packets in the case of heterogeneous link. 
(Transmission Delay: Path 1 = 6, Path 2 = 2; Propagation Delay: Both paths are 5) 
 
Figure 8: Data sending rate is reduced due to out-of-order packets in the case of heterogeneous link. 
(Transmission Delay: Path 1 = 10, Path 2 = 2; Propagation Delay: Both paths are 5) 
9 
Especially, the inappropriate cwnd updating would be a significant issue to affect the performance. 
Similarly, maintaining single rtt value to estimate multiple links is not reasonable. Intuitively, 
different paths should have different network delays. Therefore, we exploit the idea of split TCP 
and maintain multiple cwnd values for corresponding links. For every uplink link, we split a TCP 
connection into two on the MR. One is between the on-board device and the MR, and the other is 
between the MR and the corresponding host on the Internet. Similarly, downlink traffic is split on 
the HA. We call this behavior Single split connection. The MR calculates the smoothed round-trip 
time rtts and its deviation rttd as same as most implementations of TCP.  
2). Double Split Connection  
The difference between Single and Double split connection is the HA will reply a Reordering 
ACK to the MR when it receives an out-of-order packet. As shown in Figure 11, packet sending 
wouldn’t be delayed due to out-of-order packets. 
 
Figure 11: Replying the Reordering ACK while out-of-order packets have arrived in the case of 
heterogeneous link. (Transmission Delay: Path 1 = 10, Path 2 = 2; Propagation Delay: Both paths 
are 5) 
3). Congestion Control and Flow Control 
The part between the MR and the corresponding host of a split connection is further divided 
into multiple sub-connections based on the number of multi-homed links that the MR uses. Each 
sub-connection can adjust its sending rate according to its own cwnd and measured rtt. MH-TCP 
conducts a sliding window protocol as regular TCP according to the cwnd size for each 
sub-connection. Each sub-connection operates the flow control independently according to its own 
cwnd size and the amount of outstanding data size. Further, packet loss that happens in one 
sub-connection will not affect the other sub-connections.  
4). Error Control 
In MH-TCP, MR does not send data segments in a round-robin fashion. Hence, the sequence 
number of the transmitted packets on a particular link could be discontinuous. Due to IP-in-IP 
encapsulation used to change the route of packet to pass through the HA first, the outer IP header 
can be exploited for error control. First, the source IP address of outer header of data segment can 
be used to identify the packet coming from which one of multi-homed paths. Further, the Total 
Length field in the inner IP header which is the original IP header of the packet can be swapped to 
the Path Sequence for error detection in MH-TCP. The reason is the length of outer header is fixed 
in 20 bytes, and the total length field including outer IP header, inner IP header and IP payload. 
Therefore even if we remove the total length of inner header while the encapsulated packet is 
traveling, it still can be recovered by the total length of outer header. While the HA receives the 
encapsulated packet, it can detect packet loss according to the path sequence number which is a 
sequence number for each packet passing through the same path. As the example shown in Figure 
12, Packets had sequence number 2, 5, 7 and 8 are sent through the same path, and also have been
