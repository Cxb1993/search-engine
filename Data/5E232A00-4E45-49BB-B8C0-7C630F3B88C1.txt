1. Abstract
This study develops a two-dimensional
unsteady combustion model for a thin solid
fuel burning and extinction on the floor in a
quiescent, normal gravity environment. The
extinction mechanism is increase the mist
concentration and so the penetration amount
of the mist reaches the hot fuel surface, the
flame temperature decreases which eventually
cause the flame extinction. In unsteady
combustion model, vapor and oxidizer species
energy equations were accounted. From these
energy equations the variations of
concentration of vapor and oxidizer in the
flow field are estimated. The vapor and
oxidizer in flame not only dilute the fuel and
oxygen but also absorbs a lot of combustion
heat from the flame. The interaction with hot
air induced by the flame will occur
continuously when mist flow through the flow
field. The evaporation of the mist extracts a
large amount of heat from the flame. It was
found that, increase the mist concentration
results the flame size shrike and the flame
temperature decrease. The flame stick on the
fuel surface and the flames tip collapse in one
as the flame spread rate decrease. Further
increase the concentration of the mist, the
flame extinction phenomena occurred when
the critical mist concentration reaches.
Keywords: solid fuel, flame, mist
concentration, extinction
2. Introduction
Intense theoretical and experimental
investigations have recently been conducted
on downward flame spread over a solid thin
fuel surface. In the experimental studies,
Olson et al. [1] and Olson [2] used a
drop-tower to investigate the forced, opposed
flow and quiescent flame spread in
microgravity. The rate of flame spread was
measured, and a low velocity-quenching limit
was found to exist in low oxygen
environments. Quiescent flame spread in
microgravity experiments conducted on Space
Shuttle facilities were presented by
Bhattacharjee et al. [3]. The flame spread rate
was determined using a frame-by-frame
analysis of the film, and the solid surface
temperature was measured.
In purely buoyant flow flame spread
experiments, Altenkirch et al. [4] investigated
the buoyancy effects on downward spreading
flames over thermally thin fuel. The parameter
variation was determined by performing flame
spread experiments in a closed chamber,
which was swung on a centrifuge to generate a
gravitational acceleration above that of the
Earth. The rates of flame spread were obtained
as the 5-cm spacing, divided by the elapsed
time, was measured using an electrical clock.

2.3 Computational Grid
The strong coupling between pressure
and velocity in the full unsteady
Navier-Stokes equations in gas phase are
solved using the SIMPLE algorithm [7]. The
detail computational procedure can be referred
to Ref [5]. A non-uniform grid of exponential
distribution in the gas phase was used with the
grid points being concentrated near the
gas-solid interface, where ignition is likely, to
capture the significant change in the
temperatures and flow field. A grid test has
been conducted to ensure that the solutions are
independent of grid size. The grid numbers of
the entire computational domain were 238 for
x, 153 for y direction, the corresponding
nondimensional computational domain was
445.36363.21, and dimensional
computational area was 61.2450.16 cm2.
The nondimensional time step for
computation was 13 corresponding 0.0712 s
of the physical time.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The flames shape, flow velocities vector
distributions and temperature contours after 2
s of ignition occurs at various vapor
concentration are shown in the Figure 2 and
Figure 3, respectively. As shown in the figures,
the flame structure in zero vapor concentration
is strongest because the flame length and
flame temperature are greatest. While the
flame structure in 0.3 vapor concentration is
weakest because the flame length and
temperature are weakest. The weaker of the
flame is due to the decrease of the fuel
concentration caused by the greater of the
vapor concentration. This can be confirmed
from the OH2Y =0.3 plot in Figure 2 in which
the buoyant flow velocity vectors are the
biggest compare to the other cases. The
maximum buoyant flow velocity in OH2Y =0.3
case within the region show in the plot is
