computational efficiency and efficacy. In addition, a 
molten system was investigated using a similar 
multiscale scheme, revealing several previously 
unnoticed features of nonlinear chain relaxation in 
entangled state.

1. Background 
    For a basic understanding of the flowing behavior of complex fluids, rheo-optical measuring techniques 
are indispensable in resolving the microstructures and dynamics of the constituting molecules and/or 
particles. In our lab, we have established a series of rheo-optical measuring systems, including individual 
apparatuses on small-angle light scattering (SALS), flow wide-angle light scattering (FWALS), and 
phase-modulated flow birefringence (PMFB), which have all been well calibrated. The experimental setups 
are readily utilized to resolve structural features as well as their time evolutions in various flow systems, for 
a wide range of fluids and practical applications. 
 
Recently, we have succeeded in taking advantage of homemade DLS/SLS to delve into the structural 
features of dilute conjugated polymer solutions. Conducting conjugated polymers have nowadays become a 
popular molecular material for fabricating solution-processable polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED)
1-3
 and 
plastic solar cells.
4-6
 Among the most appealing features of exploiting long-chain organic semiconductors is 
the possibility of fine-tuning the optoelectronic behavior of solution-cast films by selecting different 
solvents or hybrid solvents.
7,8
 Considering a widely studied conjugated 
polymer,poly(2-methoxy-5-(2’-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV), dissolved in two 
distinct solvents (i.e., chloroform or toluene) for a range of concentrations (i.e., 0.1 3 mg/mlc   ) in the 
dilute regime, we propose a self-consistent formulation for analyzing DLS data that represents a plausible 
extension of an existing theory on free-draining bead-spring chains for dynamic structure factor, in 
conjunction with two candidate form factors for Gaussian coil and rigid sphere, respectively, to be further 
discriminated in SLS experiment. In this way, we show that it is possible to extract unequivocal information 
about the morphological feature, the size distribution (and mean size), mean aggregation number, and 
interior segmental dynamics of typical MEH-PPV solutions, which remained largely unexplored to date yet 
is valuable to contemporary applications with conducting conjugated polymers.  
 
On the other hand, multiscale simulations were utilized to clarify a long-standing ambiguity as to the 
molecular effects of specific solvents, unveiling previously unnoticed physics underlying the promising 
features of hybrid solvents in casting polymer thin films, as evidenced by recent experiments. Through 
multiscale simulation schemes, including AMD (atomistic molecular dynamics), CGMD (coarse-grained 
molecular dynamics) and CGLD (coarse-grained Langevin dynamics), aggregate morphologies of two 
standard conjugated polymers (e.g., MEH-PPV and PANI-EB) from solution to the quenching state have 
been explored. In addition to the structural/morphological studies on conjugated polymer systems, the 
relaxation dynamics of molten vinyl polymers was also scrutinized. Vinyl polymers, such as polystyrene and 
polyethylene, are commonly used as industrial polymeric materials.Viscoelastic properties play an essential 
role during the procession in molten state, as qualitatively captured by classical theories.
9 
Compared with 
atomistic polymer models and the attendant AMD simulations, CG polymer models and simulation schemes 
have recently been shown to be an effective means to investigate the viscoelastic properties of polymer 
melts at reasonable computational expense,
10 
thus permitting access to large-scale material properties.

3.1.3. Rheo-WALS 
As shown in Fig. 3c, installation of the main parts of rheo-WALS apparatus such as the quarts cell, index 
matching vat, double center goniometer, and optical fiber has been completed. In particular, the fiber was 
utilized to reduce the instrument size and helped transmit the scattering signal to the detector. The calibration 
result is shown in Fig. 6. 
 
3.2. Experiment 
3.2.1. Dynamic structure factor 
Intensity autocorrelation functions│g(2) (q,t)│were collected over a range of scattering angles (θ = 30º 
- 110
º
) for MEH-PPV in toluene and chloroform, respectively, at various polymer concentrations: 
0.1,  0.3,  1,  and 3 mg/ml . The aim is to unveil the aggregate morphologies and internal motions in the first 
place, so that the mean sizes and detailed size distributions may be determined unambiguously. The DLS 
curves in Fig. 7 do not collapse into a single curve after the rescaling of the delay time ( t ) with 2q , 
especially for the better solvent, chloroform. Specifically, the acceleration of relaxation with enlarged 
scattering angle clearly indicates that the contribution from internal segmental motions must be at play. 
 
Figures. 8 and 9 show the resolved distributions of the DLS results shown in Fig. 7 based on two 
different assumptions for the form factor. Figure 10 shows the area ratio AI/( AD+ AI ) denoting the fraction 
of the scattering intensity (obtained from an integration of the results shown in Figures 8 and 9) from the 
internal motions for the two solvent systems, where AD represents the contribution from the mass-center 
diffusion. As expected, the internal motions come into play at  q〈  Rg〉≥ 1. In general, this ratio for 
MEH-PPV/toluene solution keeps increasing with increased q〈  Rg〉, whereas it quickly reaches a plateau for 
MEH-PPV/chloroform solution at low concentrations. These trends are understandable, considering there is 
a relatively small amount of MEH-PPV aggregates in chloroform that meet the criterion q〈 Rg〉> 1 and thus 
contribute much less to the scattering intensity in this high-q regime; only as the concentration is elevated to 
3 mg/ml can a ratio as high as ~0.5 be attained at large angles. 
 
From a different perspective, we discuss a more detailed analysis of the interior dynamics of large 
aggregate species. Following the prediction of the Zimm model, for example, the reduced first cumulant 
(0) 3
Bq q k T  as a function of q〈  Rg〉 has often been employed to fathom the internal dynamics of flexible 
polymer solutions under the influence of hydrodynamic interactions. Figure 11 shows such relation for 
MEH-PPV solutions, along with the experimental results on polystyrene/toluene solutions reported earlier.
13 
For the poorer-solvent MEH-PPV/toluene solutions, the reduced cumulant begins to exhibit a plateau ( 3q  
dependence) at relatively large values of q〈  Rg〉 compared with MEH-PPV/chloroform solutions. In general, 
this quantity falls substantially below that for polystyrene/toluene solutions, indicating that the internal 
motions of MEH-PPV aggregates are considerably more suppressed, possibly due to stronger segmental 
interactions. Moreover, the suppression in internal motions becomes more prominent with decreasing 
6 
 
that are to be avoided by the phenyl backbone. On the other hand, they help shield the ―repulsions‖ directly 
between CF and MEH-PPV backbone, thus encouraging immigration of CF molecules into the ―boundary 
layer‖ regime to attract the side-chain groups more effectively. Figures 14a-b, revealed the detailed 
mechanisms of chain quenching as subject to their prior solvent-induced chain conformations. It is evident 
that a previously extended and loose chain conformation, such as that formed in the CF/CB=2:1 medium, 
permits a relatively regular chain folding along the pivotal tetrahedral defects and, in turn, results in a notably 
higher degree of ordered    stacking, as can be seen in Fig. 14c, which promotes the electronic 
delocalization quintessential for local charge transports. Overall, it appears that the sophisticatedly 
compromised, local-phase molecular environment as has been disclosed for two representative binary 
(aliphatic/aromatic) solvent media of MEH-PPV not only renders in-depth insight into fine morphological 
controls in amphiphilic polymer solution, but also points to the open opportunity of propelling the frontier 
performances of conjugated polymer thin films when cast from optimum hybrid solvent media. 
 
3.4. PANI-EB in single solvent (NMP) media  
A systematic multiscale simulation was also devoted to PANI-EB/NMP solution. From CGLD 
simulations, Fig. 15 plots the mean radius of gyration and end-to-end distance as functions of chain length. 
The solvent quality exponent was thus estimated to be 0.32 0.06 , which falls substantially below the 
so-called θ condition—0.5, and it is implied that the local segmental density of isolated PANI-EB chains in 
NMP might keep growing with increasing polymer molecular weight, and therefore chain collapse could 
result for sufficiently long PANI-EB chains even at large dilution. Table 1 compares the predicted values of 
Rh and Rg as well as their ratios for various chain lengths. It is of interest to note that the ratio falls around a 
fixed value 1.7 only for chain lengths above 100 repeating units, and the predicted ratio for Rh/Rg (>1) is 
indicative of a moderate structural compactness. In this way, the simulation provides a definite lower-bound 
in polymer molecular weight (ca. 36,000 Da) when dynamic light scattering data will be employed to infer 
the geometric coil size. 
 
Figure 16 illustrates the back-mapping procedure that returns an equilibrated PANI-EB chain in NMP 
from the CGLD simulation (stage (a)) all the way to the full-atom representation ready for an AMD 
simulation (stage (c)), where HB and pi-pi interactions were selectively turned on or off in order to 
discriminate their effects on the collapsed chain morphologies in a room-temperature quenching process. 
The contrast noted between the cases with or without anisotropic forces is significant. From a different 
perspective, the signature of forming hydrogen bonds in the quenching state can be easily identified in the 
corresponding RDF plots shown in Fig. 17. Overall, it appears that while the vdW forces regulate the bulk 
single-chain properties in PANI-EB/NMP solution, the HB and pi-pi interactions accordingly dictate the 
quenched chain morphologies that mimic closely those in prior solution state. 
 
Thus, the simulation has evidenced, for the first time, the so-called memory effect stressing the intimate 
correlation between the quenched chain morphology and the prior chain conformation in precursor solution,
7
 
emphasizing the importance of controlling the molecular state at the early stage of preparing a precursor 
solution for the fabrication of a PLED.
