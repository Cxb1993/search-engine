(二) 英文摘要 
 
Wireless broadband access networks are now in widespread use due to the development of micro 
electronic and wireless communication technologies. Many industrial companies and research institutes have 
began to study and to develop the related technologies for various applications of the wireless broadband 
access networks, especially in vehicular access applications. In IEEE 802.16 wireless broadband access 
networks, the data classifying, service scheduling and radio resource assignment are controlled by base 
stations, and the served mobile stations shall act according to its serving base station or its leading relay 
station. In order to achieve vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communications, we put our focus on 
the designs of the multi-hop vehicular protocol networks (MVPNets). 
We have been studying relative vehicular ad hot network technology such as short-transmission-distance 
IEEE 802.11p. This proposal aims to design of MVPNets based on long-transmission-distance IEEE 802.16e 
multi-hop WMAN. For speeding up the evaluations of the system performance, the popular QualNet 
simulator is adopted as the platform, and we will develop the related modules such as the proposed vehicular

本研究計畫之目的是發展行車間無線傳輸的關鍵技術，此車輛網路系統是以 IEEE 802.16e­2005 標
準規格為基礎，延伸出更適合用於車輛網路的前瞻性規格，以支援下一代車輛網路應用的需求。 
此車輛網路系統與原來 IEEE 802.16e 的無線網路架構不同，其需要能夠涵蓋更大的傳輸範圍以及
更有效率的傳輸品質，因車輛在行進中，不希望服務中斷或品質不穩定；再者，在目前通訊產品越來
越普及的狀況下，車用網路變成很多國際大廠下一步想要開發的市場，其相關服務包括了保全、安全
監控、通訊、智慧行運輸系統、娛樂、導航、資訊等大眾所關心的服務項目，但目前 IEEE 802.16e 的
軟體或硬體皆未普及，因此本計劃將以標準 IEEE 802.16e 的規格為基礎，建構出本計劃所設計之車輛
網路系統模擬環境，以驗證其比標準的 IEEE 802.16e 或 IEEE 802.16j 更適用於車輛網路。 
結合 IEEE 802.16e 與 IEEE 802.16j 為一內容新穎的網路研究計劃，計劃初期本計畫將以過去研究
的成果，進一步設計出完整的車輛網路系統規格，此規格包含從實體層（Physical Layer）與媒介存取
控制層（Medium Access Control Layer）的設計，並且完整建置此車輛網路系統之模擬環境，並依據每
一年的成果，同步完成該成果之研究分析，用以作為發展此具前瞻性系統的重要依據。 
以 QualNet 而言，因為本身已經具備 WiMAX 模組，所以規劃結合原有模型新增 IEEE 802.16j 模
組，藉著 QualNet 強大的圖形化介面及分析統計功能，將我們所設計的 IEEE 802.16j 模組作模擬、分

在這個 CSS 方法裡，我們結合了 WiMAX 及 WAVE 網路的優點去安排 D-RSU 及 D-OBU 使得它們
更有效率地存取多個頻道。所以我們讓 BS 來做 WAVE 網路的頻道存取排程，並將排程用 WiMAX 傳
輸資料用的 Burst 來把排程當成資料傳給傳輸範圍內的 OBU，因為 WiMAX 為都會區域型網路，所以
可以涵蓋和服務多個 RSU 及多個 OBU。除了修改 Burst 之外，還修改原本的 50ms 的 CCH interval 為
一個 5ms 的 WiMAX frame，CCH interval 和 WiMAX frame 的重疊將使 OBU 不再需要聽 WSA 而是聽
WiMAX frame 裡 Burst 的排程，5ms 的 CCH interval 則專門用來傳遞緊急訊息，再者其目的是讓 SCH 
interval 有較大的頻寬，在有中控排程下有更好的效能。此外我們不考慮從 RSU 來的資料，我們只考

2. 容錯傳輸機制： 
雖然標準規範中已提供很多種抗干擾方法，但外部 external 干擾仍然會對無線傳輸形成很大
干擾，為有效解決安全的傳輸問題，我們提出容錯傳輸機制 fault-tolerant  transmission 
mechanism  (FTM)。在 MAC 層(medium  access  control)中，將傳輸時槽(slot)  拆散，調整
burst 大小，重組傳輸槽位置，緊密重組下載傳輸資料框(frame)，當收到封包時，再和傳輸樣式
比對關係位置，還原 burst 資料，因此具有容錯能力，提高安全傳輸，達到較高的成功傳輸機率，
如圖十一所示。

對於車輛外部的無線傳輸環境和 Internet 結合研究，當資料需要傳輸到網際網路時，改進無線

差距離的變異數調整權重的 Scheme 2、依照內插和外插法調整權重的 Scheme 3。此三種方法將
詳細說明如下： 
  
圖十六、三種調整權重之定位演算法 
(1). Scheme 1(Current Divider Rule) 
此機制主要是將訓練點之定位誤差距離(Error Distance, ED)，其權重的計算方法是引用電流分
流規則(Current Divider Rule, CDR)，將誤差距離視為並聯電路的電阻，權重為各支路的電流。當該
定位方法的誤差距離越大的時候，得到的權重會越低，相反的，誤差距離越小，權重越高；所以
我們利用誤差距離的倒數當做判斷依據，而將誤差距離倒數的總和當成分母，藉此計算出三個不
同的權重 
(2). Scheme 2 (Variance of Error Distance) 
此機制是將訓練點之定位誤差距離結果，取其變異數為權重調整的依據，即先計算出誤差距離
的變異數，並求得誤差距離平均值並定位出使用者的位置。 
(3). Scheme 3 (Interpolation & Extrapolation) 
此機制混合使用內插法(Interpolation)及外插法(Extrapolation)調整定位結果。即每次調整權重
時，先依照誤差距離計算平均權重，並沿用到下次調整權重為止。不過依照不同的定位結果，分
別代入內插法或外插法調整定位結果。

INTRODUCTION
People are gradually becoming familiar with
using wireless networks to transfer various forms
of data such as emails, videos, and pictures,
which all benefit from the fast growing wireless
communication technologies. Many enhanced
technologies of wireless networks have been
investigated and contributed by academia and
industry over the past few decades. Along with
carrier aggregation, enhanced multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO), and coordinated mul-
tipoint processing (CoMP), relay is one of the
most attractive technologies [1, 2]. Consequently,
relay has been included in both candidates for
International Mobile Telecommunications
(IMT)-Advanced (fourth generation [4G]) stan-
dards, Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A)
by the Third Generation Partnership Project
(3GPP) for LTE and IEEE 802.16m (16m) by
the IEEE for WiMAX.
Despite their short history, three relay stan-
dards have been or are being specified for
WIMAX and LTE: IEEE 802.16j, IEEE
802.16m, and 3GPP LTE-A Release 10. IEEE
802.16j was completed in 2009 and published as
IEEE 802.16-2009. The IEEE 802.16m draft
standard, which is an amendment to IEEE
802.16-2009, entered the Sponsor Ballot phase in
June 2010, while its end-to-end protocols beyond
radio interfaces are left in the hands of the
WiMAX Forum to adopt 802.16m into a
WiMAX profile. Finally, after a year of debate
in the 3GPP radio access network (RAN1/
RAN2/RAN3) working groups, the relay study
item was closed in March 2010 with a consensus
on a single LTE-A relay architecture for Release
10, which is expected to be released in 2011.
Relay as discussed in standards can be divid-
ed into two categories, depending on whether
the relay node has the authority to manage the
resources, or more specifically whether the relay
node can generate cell control messages. One
relay category, named non-transparent (NT)
relay by the IEEE 802.16 working group and
type-1 relay by 3GPP, has the features of distinct
cell IDs and generating its own cell control mes-
sages. An NT-relay schedules assigned radio
resources within its own cell. The other relay
category, named transparent (T) relay by IEEE
802.16 working group and type-2 relay by 3GPP,
shares cell IDs and cell control messages with its
serving BS.
The radio link originating or terminating at a
subscriber station (SS) is named the access link
(Uu interface).The radio link between a BS and
a relay or between a pair of relays is called the
relay link (Un interface). In addition, based on
the assigned radio frequency (RF) channels for
the relay link and access link, a relay can be fur-
ther categorized as an inband (TTR) relay or an
outband (STR) relay. The inband relay uses the
same RF channel and the same radio resources
are shared between the relay link and the access
link, whereas the outband relay uses different
RF channels (or the same RF channel but with-
out sharing radio resources) on the relay and
access links.
Figure 1 shows various relay categories in
three standards. 802.16j has the most compre-
hensive relay categories compared to the other
standards. That is, 802.16m and LTE-A Release
10 include only a subset of relay categories
defined in 802.16j. In the subsequent design
trade-off subsection we explain various concerns
within each standard working group that led to
the relay feature down-selection just mentioned.
Table 1 is a terminology cross-reference
between WiMAX and LTE. For brevity, terms
listed in Table 1 are interchangeable in the ensu-
ing discussions.
The article is organized as follows. The next
ABSTRACT
There are two candidates for IMT-Advanced
(4G) standards, LTE-Advanced by 3GPP and
802.16m by IEEE. This article focuses on relay
architectures in 16m and LTE-A, and discusses
design principles and trade-offs leading to deci-
sions in each standards group. Basically, 16m
relay and LTE-A Release 10 relay are very simi-
lar technologies where the relay is essentially an
orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
base station with a wireless backhaul link. How-
ever, some open issues, such as mobility, power
saving, multihop architecture, transparent relay-
ing, multi-arrier transmission, and cooperative
transmission, are still left as challenges for engi-
neers and researchers. This article provides
insights to both relay standards that could be
helpful for readers to fully comprehend practical
ways of incorporating relays into 4G wireless
broadband networks.

receiving the R6 message, it reads the AMS
identity in the message and translates the R6
message between the two interfaces by means of
encapsulating the R6 message in an AAI_R6-
Container message (leaving the R6 message
unchanged) and sends it to the target ARS over
the management flow. Over the relay link, an
ARS’s R6 messages are carried in new contain-
ers over the management flow instead of over
UDP/IP as currently defined for R6 signaling.
In the latter case (Fig. 5b) the R6 messages
with UDP/IP are forwarded to the ARS via the
ABS in the original format through a data flow
and encapsulated in the relay medium access
control (MAC) protocol data unit (MPDU).
The U-plane of the R6 interface is terminat-
ed at the ABS (Fig. 5c) or ARS (Fig. 5d). In the
former case, the ASN-GW serving the AMS
maps the incoming IP packets to the generic
routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnels corre-
sponding to the data flow of the AMS and sends
the tunneled packets to the IP address of the
ABS. Upon the ABS receiving the tunneled
packets from the ASN-GW, the received packets
are detunneled, and the inner user packets are
mapped to a data flow of an AMS by means of
mapping the GRE tunnel ID (i.e., the KEY field
in the GRE header) to a data flow of the AMS.
The user packets are first packed into an MPDU,
and then a number of MPDUs are further encap-
sulated in the relay MPDU of the ARS and
mapped to a data flow with similar quality of
service (QoS) over the relay link.
In the latter case the packets received at the
ABS from the ASN-GW are not detunneled but
preserved in the original format before being
encapsulated into the relay MPDU.
In summary, the architecture is not expected
to require any new functionality in R1 and R6
protocols defined for the ABS; hence, it is possi-
ble to use the same R1 and R6 protocols in the
802.16m relay.
DESIGN TRADE-OFF
In view of the intricate protocol design for the
IEEE 802.16j relay, the simplicity and explicit-
ness of designing the IEEE 802.16m relay have
become the general consensus for the purpose of
speeding up standardization. For instance, the
mobile relay is not discussed in the IEEE
802.16m task group (TG), as the designs of
orthogonal preamble assignment within a cell,
hierarchical handover procedure, and so on
undoubtedly make mobile relay much more
complicated than fixed relay. Moreover, impos-
ing restrictions on a two-hop topology is an intu-
itive way to eliminate the controversial issues of
path management and data forwarding, which
were widely discussed and debated in the IEEE
802.16j TG and eventually led to the adoption of
four different data forwarding schemes. Consid-
ering the round-trip delay of conveying control
signals by multihop relays, the distributed con-
trol/scheduling mode adopted by 802.16m TG
seems more efficient than the centralized con-
trol/scheduling mode. Due to time constraints
for the IEEE 802.16m TG to prepare the pro-
posal for the ITU IMT-Advanced submission
and minimizing relay-only specifications, only
the non-transparent relay acting in TTR relay-
ing, which maximizes commonality between
ARSs and ABSs, was included in the present
specification.
OPEN ISSUES
It is evident that lots of issues with the IEEE
802.16m relay remain for further study. For exam-
ple, the present design implicitly supports two
options for configuring the R6 interface between
ASN-GW and ARS according to whether an ABS
would detunnel and interpret the R6 backhaul
signals exchanged between an ASN-GW and its
subordinate ARS(s) or not. The decision needs to
be made by the WiMAX Forum regarding
whether to choose one or both options for manip-
ulating backhaul control signals.
Moreover, supporting the flow aggregation
and header compression in the relay link needs
to be further studied before deploying 802.16m
relay in a commercial network. It is worthwhile
to note that other omitted features of an
advanced relay, such as mobility, power saving,
multihop architecture, transparent relaying, mul-
ticarrier transmission, and cooperative transmis-
sion, are attractive challenges for engineers and
researchers.
LTE-A RELAY
In Release 10 LTE-A a work item on relay was
created to support type 1 relay for at least cover-
age extension. Two variants of type 1 relay have
been added in LTE-A. Type 1a operates out-of-
band, and type 1b operates in-band but with
adequate antenna isolation. Both of them are
expected to have little impact on RAN1 specifi-
cations and would share the same sets of signal-
ing protocols in the higher layers with type 1
relay. LTE-A type 1 relay is equivalent to IEEE
802.16m TTR relaying, while LTE-A type 1a and
1b relays share the same characteristics as IEEE
802.16 STR relaying, where transmission to sub-
ordinate station(s) and reception from the super-
ordinate station, or transmission to the
superordinate station and reception from subor-
dinate station(s) are performed simultaneously.
MAJOR FEATURES IN SPECIFICATIONS
Type 1 relay has the following characteristics [3]:
• It controls cells, each of which appears to
UE as a separate cell distinct from the
donor cell.

The DeNB is responsible for which reference
signal is configured semi-statically for the back-
haul downlink. Note that if Release 10 LTE-A
UE units are the majority in the system, MBSFN
subframes can be used on the Un link, which
relies solely on Release 10 DM RSs for demodu-
lation. Also note the when global synchroniza-
tion is required between the DeNB and RNs,
the last few OFDM symbols would be punctured
and Release 10 DM RS pattern needs to be
modified. The detail is still in discussion.
The C-plane and U-plane architecture for
LTE-A Release 10 relay is shown in Fig. 7. S1-
AP is a radio network layer signaling protocol
for the S1 interface of LTE. In this case S1-AP
messages are terminated in both the DeNB
and RN. This operation corresponds to an S1-
AP proxy mechanism and is similar to home
eNB gateway (HeNB GW) functionality. The
S1-AP proxy operation would be transparent
for the MME and RN. That is, as seen from
the MME it looks as if the UE is connected to
the DeNB, while from the RN’s perspective it
looks as if  the RN is talking to the MME
directly. The S1-AP messages encapsulated by

GW-like functionality, a DeNB can perform
S1/X2 proxy functions.
DESIGN TRADE-OFF
Pros and cons of TDM+FDM vs. pure FDM are
compared in Table 2. Since R-PDCCH is in the
first slot of the subframe in TDM+FDM, an RN
can start decoding the R-PDCCH and data earli-
er. In TDM+FDM case, a scheduling grant mes-
sage fits well the resources for R-PDCCH within
a PRB. For pure FDM, grant messages of multi-
ple RNs are needed to fill up a PRB. So the
resource granularity is finer in TDM+FDM.
Hence, TDM+FDM offers more frequency
diversity when resources are distributed, and
more frequency selective or precoding gain when
resources are localized. Pure FDM provides
more scheduling flexibility for macro UE co-
scheduled in backhaul subframes, due to fewer
PRBs for R-PDCCH.
When considering the architecture of LTE-A
relays, there were four alternatives [4]; alterna-
tive 2 (Fig. 7) was jointly selected as the relay
architecture for Release 10 by RAN2 and RAN3.
The most important characteristics for each
alternative are listed below:
• Alternative 1: Full L3 relay, transparent to
the DeNB
• Alternative 2: Proxy S1/X2 at the DeNB
• Alternative 3: RN bearers terminated at the
DeNB
• Alternative 4: S1 U-plane terminated at the
DeNB
Table 3 compares the four alternatives in
more details. Some important design trade-offs
of the architecture are discussed below [5].
S1-AP/GTP-U Termination Point — If S1-AP
and GTP-U are only terminated at the RN as
proposed by alternatives 1 and 3, modification of
the DeNB is less because the DeNB is not
required to modify/forward S1-AP and GTP-U
connections. On the other hand, if S1-AP and
GTP-U connections are also terminated at the
DeNB as proposed by alternatives 2 and 4, some
optimizations can be performed (e.g., packet for-
warding during UE mobility) by integrating
HeNB GW functionality in the DeNB but at the
expense of increasing design complexity (e.g.,
updates of the DeNB are required) and develop-
ment cost of the DeNB.
Are S1-AP Connections Transferred in SRB
or DRB? — As described in [4], S1-AP is trans-
ferred in DRB in alternatives 1, 2, and 3 (i.e.,
architecture A), whereas S1-AP is transferred in
SRB in alternative 4 (i.e., architecture B). Pro-
ponents of architecture B have questioned the
security and latency issues of using DRB for
transferring S1-AP signals because DRB does
not have integrity functionality and its schedul-
ing priority is lower than that of SRB. Propo-
nents of architecture A believe that integrity
check functionality is easy to be applied in DRB
(if required) due to its similarity to SRB. Fur-
thermore, extending a number of SRBs to over-
come the head-of-line blocking issue and
accommodate the multistreaming requirement in
the transport layer of S1-AP were fully discussed
but without consensus.
Is SCTP/IP Required on the Un Interface? —
In the view of proponents of architecture B,
SCTP/IP is not required on the Un interface if
SRB is used for transferring S1-AP signals
because SRB can provide similar functions as
SCTP. Proponents of architecture A think that
the current design of SRB cannot provide the
multistreaming function required by the trans-
port layer of S1-AP. However, if SCTP/IP is
used to transport S1-AP messages on the Un
interface, an extra header compression (HC)
scheme may be required to reduce header over-
heads. Such header overhead can be significant
due to the excessive signaling in LTE networks
that primarily serve 4G smart phones or
machine-to-machine communications.
Many-to-One Mapping or One-to-One Map-
ping between the UE EPS Bearer and the
RN Radio Bearer? — As described in [4], EPS
bearers of UE connected to the same RN with
similar QoS are mapped into the same RN radio
bearer in architecture A (i.e., many-to-one map-
ping). However, for architecture B, each EPS
bearer of UE connected to the RN is mapped to
separate radio bearers over the Un interface
(i.e., one-to-one mapping). Therefore, QoS con-
trol is performed at a different level of granular-
ity in architecture A (i.e., the RN bearer level)
and architecture B (i.e., the UE bearer level).
Proponents of architecture A consider the Un
interface a wireless backhaul where static or
semi-static QoS configurations/mapping should
be sufficient in practice for deploying LTE-A
Release 10 networks.
OPEN ISSUES
As a complement to the coverage extension
capability of type 1 relay, type 2 relay in LTE-A
is suitable for capacity enhancement. 3GPP
RAN1 has spent quite some time studying type 2

CONTROL PLANE
From the C-plane’s point of view, 802.16m and
LTE-A Release 10 are similar. It is R6 over R1 in
802.16m and S1-MME over Un in LTE-A Release
10. Regarding hop count and mobility of the
relay, both 802.16m and LTE-A Release 10 are
limited to two-hop and fixed relay. Relay radio
resource scheduling is performed by relay in both
standards. HARQ and network layer security are
hop-by-hop in these two standards. One major
difference between the two standards is that
802.16m supports in-band relay only, whereas
LTE-A Release 10 supports in-band and out-of-
band relays. That is, LTE-A Release 10 relay pro-
vides more deployment options for operators.
USER PLANE
From the U-plane’s point of view, U-plane data
are aggregated on the relay link in both stan-
dards. Header compression is performed hop-by-
hop in both standards to reduce header
overheads. 802.16m relay provides more options
than LTE-A Release 10 relay due to the fact
that R6 can be terminated at the ABS or ARS,
whereas S1-U can only be terminated at the RN.
By performing side-by-side comparisons on
two relay systems, we observe quite a lot of simi-
larities between 802.16m relay and LTE-A
Release 10 relay with regard to the design tar-
gets and adopted solutions. However, the
802.16m AMS is ARS-aware, whereas LTE
Release 8 UE was not allowed to be enhanced
to be RN-aware. Hence, communications on the
backhaul link of an LTE-A inband relay are less
flexible and efficient than the similar backhaul
link of an 802.16m TTR relay. This disadvantage
is expected to be larger in the TDD system than
in the FDD system due to HARQ timing con-
straints.
CONCLUSIONS
In this article two relay standards are introduced.
Some insights on IEEE 802.16m and 3GPP LTE-
A Release 10 relays are provided to help readers
fully comprehend practical ways of incorporating
relays into 4G wireless broadband networks. Two
relay standards are also compared in various
aspects of the (sub)frame structure and protocol
stacks (C-plane and U-plane). From the compari-
son results, it can be seen that IEEE 802.16m
relay and LTE-A Release 10 relay are very simi-
lar technologies where the relay is essentially an
orthogonal frequency-division multiple access
base station with a wireless backhaul link. How-
ever, since both relay standards adopted only
basic relaying functionalities, many issues are still
left open for engineers and researchers investi-
gating next-generation relay systems.
