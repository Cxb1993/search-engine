Abstract
A set Q ⊆ V is a hub set of a graph G = (V,E) if, for every pair of vertices
u, v ∈ V \Q, there exists a path from u to v such that all intermediate vertices are
in Q. The hub number of G is the minimum size of a hub set in G. This paper
derives the hub numbers of Sierpin´ski graphs S(n, k). Meanwhile, the corresponding
minimum hub sets are also obtained.
Keywords: Hub numbers, Dominating sets, Sierpin´ski graphs, Extended Sierpin´ski
graphs, Sierpin´ski-like graphs.
1 Introduction
Let G = (V,E) be a simple connected graph with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G). Sets
V (G) and E(G) are simply written as V and E, respectively, when it is clear from context.
In [20], Walsh defined a hub set as follows: A set Q ⊆ V is a hub set of G if, for every pair
of vertices u, v ∈ V \ Q, there exists a path from u to v such that all intermediate vertices
are in Q. Such a path is called a Q-path, denoted hp(u, v;Q). The hub number of G, denoted
h(G), is the minimum size of a hub set in G. A hub set Q is connected if the subgraph of G
induced by Q is connected. The connected hub number of G, denoted hc(G), is the minimum
size of a connected hub set in G. For brevity, we use Qh(G) (respectively, Qch(G)) to stand for
a minimum (respectively, minimum connected) hub set of G. Walsh proved that determining
whether a graph G has a (connected) hub set of size k is NP-complete [20].

is, V (S(n, k)) = {1, 2, . . . , k}n. For simplicity, we use `(v) to denote the label of v. Thus,
if the label of v is 〈v1, v2, . . . , vn〉, then `(v) = 〈v1, v2, . . . , vn〉, or in the regular expression
form `(v) = v1v2 . . . vn. By using a convention on representing regular expression, we always
use w, x, y, and z to denote a substring of v1v2 . . . vn and a, b, c, and d to denote a number in
v1v2 . . . vn, i.e., a, b, c, d ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k}. For example, `(v) = wabn−h, for 1 ≤ h ≤ n, means
that the label of v begins with a prefix w, then concatenates with a number a, and finally ends
with n− h b′s where bh is the Kleen closure in regular expression. For convenience, we also use
the label form to represent a vertex. This means that if `(v) = wabn−h, then we also say that
wabn−h is a vertex.

Two different vertices u and v are adjacent in S(n, k) if and only if `(u) = wabn−h and
`(v) = wban−h with a 6= b for any 1 ≤ h ≤ n. Note that if h = 1, then w = ∅. Further, if
h = n, then both of bn−h and an−h are empty. We use (u, v) (or, in the label form, (`(u), `(v)))
to denote the edge incident to both u and v. By the above definition, the subgraph of S(n, k)
induced by the vertices whose labels begin with a is a Sierpin´ski subgraph S(n − 1, k) and we
use Sa(n − 1, k) to stand for these subgraphs. Vertex v ∈ V (S(n, k)) is an extreme vertex if
`(v) = an. Therefore, there are exactly k extreme vertices in S(n, k). Since the label of an
extreme vertex v is an, by definition, v can only has k−1 neighbors whose labels are of the form
an−1b with b 6= a. Every non-extreme vertex v with `(v) = wabn−h has exactly k neighbors
whose labels are of the form wban−h and wabn−h−1c with 1 ≤ c ≤ k and c 6= b. We use N(v)
to denote the open neighborhood of v, i.e., all adjacent vertices of v. The closed neighborhood

Proof. We shall prove this lemma by mathematical induction on n. For the basis step, i.e.,
n = 2, QS(2,k) is the vertex set {12, 13, . . . , 1k, 21, 31, . . . , k1}. By definition, there is an edge
between 1a and a1 for a 6= 1. Furthermore, 1a and 1b for 1 ≤ a, b ≤ k and a 6= b are also
adjacent. Thus, QS(2,k) is connected and the basis step holds.
By the induction hypothesis, every Sa(n, k), for a = 1, 2, . . . , k, has a corresponding set
QSa(n,k) which is connected. Moreover, vertex b1
n−1 is in QSb(n,k) for b = 2, 3, . . . , k. By
definition, vertex b1n−1, for b = 2, 3, . . . , k, is adjacent with vertex 1bn−1 which is in QS1(n,k).
This implies that QS(n,k) is connected and the lemma follows. 
Lemma 4. QS(n,k) is a connected hub set of S(n, k) for n ≥ 2.
Proof. By Lemma 3, QS(n,k) is a connected set. All we have to prove is that QS(n,k) is a hub
set. By definition, every S(n, k) contains k copies of S(n − 1, k), every S(n − 1, k) contains
k copies of S(n − 2, k), and so on. Consequently, S(n, k) contains kn−1 copies S(1, k) which
is a complete graph of k vertices. Clearly, every vertex belongs to some S(1, k) and every
S(1, k) has exactly one vertex whose label ends with a for a = 1, 2, . . . , k. By the definition of
QS(n,k), every vertex with label ended with 1 is in QS(n,k) except 1
n. Thus, every vertex with
label not ended with 1 is adjacent with a vertex with label ended with 1 in their corresponding
S(1, k) except the one containing 1n. For the S(1, k) containing 1n, by definition, all of its other
vertices are in QS(n,k). This reveals that every vertex in V (S(n, k)) \QS(n,k) is adjacent with a
vertex in QS(n,k). Therefore, for every pair of vertices u, v ∈ V (S(n, k)) \QS(n,k), there exists a
hp(u, v;QS(n,k)). This completes the proof. 
Corollary 5. For every S(n, k) with n ≥ 2, h(S(n, k)) ≤ hc(S(n, k)) ≤ 2(kn−1 − 1).
Proposition 6. For any two vertices u, v ∈ V in graph G = (V,E), if N [u] ⊆ N [v], then Qh(G)
cannot contain both of u and v.
Lemma 7. For any S(n, k) with n, k ≥ 1, h(S(n, k)) ≥ 2(kn−1 − 1).
Proof. We prove this lemma by induction on n. Since S(1, k) is a complete graph of k vertices,
h(S(1, k)) = 0 = 2(k1−1 − 1). Thus, the basis step holds immediately.
