finger-to-finger valleys. The proposed algorithm locates the finger-to-finger valleys more 
accurately and more efficiently; it amputates fingers from the hand image automatically and 
calculates the features and shapes of each finger; it also uses amputated fingers to generate 
additional geometrical features containing more opulent data than the finger crease pattern [Joshi 
et al., 1998] and the rude finger shape matching methods [Han et al., 2004; Sanchez-Reillo et al., 
2000]. Implicit polynomials [Oden et al., 2003] have much difficulty in describing finger shapes 
by the power-of-seven polynomial functions. Knuckle ridges extraction and enhancement [Ferrer 
et al., 2006; Ravikanth et al., 2007] and finger-to-finger seam recognition [Zheng et al., 2007] are 
new approach to recognize hands. In the previous research, palm-prints [Han et al., 2004], iris, 
fingerprints, facial features, and vein patterns [Lin et al., 2004] were also used to identify 
different individuals. Vein patterns [Lin et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2007] are 
susceptible to body temperature and are unreliable to identify the hands. 
In this study, the new technique [Su, 2003] is used to extract: thumb, index, middle, ring, and 
small fingers and to perform finger identification. The geometrical descriptor is used to transfer 
geometrical features of the finger to another feature domain for image comparison. For reducing 
the number of files in the system, all the fingers of one person are placed in one file. Image 
subtraction is used to examine the difference of the two fingers. The hand is fixed each time when 
photographing and it is assumed that each time when the hand image is taken, it presents the 
same shape as the previous acquired ones; subsequently, after the fingers are extracted, they can 
be used to identify different persons. This report consists of four sections. Section 2 acquires the 
hand image; section 3 extracts the finger images; section 4 describes the geometrical descriptor 
and image subtraction. section 5 concludes this report. 
 
2. Acquiring hand image. 
 
Figure 2.1 shows the acquired hand images. After further processing, one can obtain the 
hand-edge images. The hand-edge images are shown in figure 2.2. Figure 2.3 shows the geometry 
features of the hand image. By the edge thinning direction and the hand geometry features, one 
can extract the fingertips and finger-valleys. The results are shown in figure 2.4.

has 5 persons. Since one person has been taken three different photos, totally fifteen photos are 
taken for each group. To each group, one hundred and five comparisons are conducted to find the 
accurate-identification-rate of the developed identification algorithm. Within those one hundred 
and five comparisons, fifteen comparisons are conducted for self-comparison – since one person 
taken three different photos. The data of these fifteen comparisons are shown inside the 
rectangular boxes. The other ninety comparisons are conducted for comparisons between two 
different sources. Figure 5.1 shows parts of the data. The comparisons of the same person’s finger 
images yield much less values; however, the comparisons of the different person’s finger images 
yield much greater values. For the first group test, the error rate for the index finger is 22%, the 
middle finger is 9%, and the ring finger is 11%. For the second group, the error rate for the index 
finger is 35%, the middle finger is 29%, and the ring finger is 15%.

Abstract - This study invests a technique to recognize a hand. 
This study solves the hand rotating- and shifting-problems. A 
ring-to-line mapping technique is used to map a hand image 
to several straight-line signals. Moreover, the vector 
manipulating technique is used to transfer a hand signal to an 
invariant magnitude, whereby to recognize a hand. Various 
vertical magnitude strips are generated to manage the image-
shifting problem. The algorithm developed in this study can 
recognize a hand. 
Keywords: Hand dorsal recognition, rotated hand 
recognition, and complex vector manipulation. 
 
1 Introduction 
In the past twenty years, researchers have devoted 
much attention to identify the hands, which have included: 
hand-geometry matching [1, 2, 4, 6], middle finger crease 
pattern matching [7], various finger size measurements [3, 8, 
9], various finger lateral view size measurements [9, 12], vein 
pattern [5, 15], eigenpalm, implicit polynomials, algebraic 
invariants [10], Karen invariant computation [11, 16], line 
interception and slope comparisons, control point selection, 
coarse to fine strategy [17], 3-D palm [14], principal 
component analysis [13], Hausdorff distance, watershed 
transform, and HMM. However, some of these techniques are 
very sensitive to noise, some have very complicated 
mathematical models, and some have very complicated neural 
training algorithms. 
In the aforementioned research, when performing hand-
geometry matching for recognizing images, the hand must be 
placed in a precisely fixed position before the camera can 
capture the same image [7, 14]. In the present study the hand 
does not need to place in a fix position. Still, the hand 
recognition algorithm can recognize them. Implicit 
polynomials have much difficulty in describing finger shapes 
by the power-of-seven polynomial functions. Knuckle ridges 
extraction and enhancement and finger-to-finger seam 
recognition are new approach to recognize hands. In the 
previous research, palm-prints, iris, fingerprints, facial 
features, and vein patterns were also used to identify different 
individuals [7, 14]. Vein patterns [5, 15] are susceptible to 
body temperature and are unreliable to identify a hand. 
A new, practical, and effective hand recognition method is 
proposed to identify a hand as the steps of follows: (1) the tip 
of the middle finger is detected; (2) this middle finger tip is 
used as a centroid to generate an extracting circle; (3) this 
extracting circle is used to extract a hand image (4) a “vector 
magnitude invariant transform” technique is used to transfer 
this extracted signal to an invariant vector magnitudes and (5) 
this magnitude is served as an identifier to identify different 
hands. The remainder of this report consists of four sections. 
In Section 2, the mechanism for the “vector magnitude 
invariant transform” is explained. In Section 3, a hand signals 
are extracted. Section 4 shows how to solve a hand-shifting 
problem. Section 5 concludes this report 
2 Vector magnitude invariant transform 
Figure 1 shows the tip of the middle finger is used as 
the centroid to generate a circle. When following this circle, 
partial hand images can be extracted. For reducing and 
condensing the amount of signal, a 128-point sampling 
process is conducted to obtain signals 0x , 1x , 2x , L , 127x  
from this extracted hand signal. Equation 1 shows the 
function of “vector magnitude invariant transform”. In this 
equation, )( 0xf represents the gray level of pixel 0x ; 
)( 1xf , 1x ; )( 2xf , 2x ; L . The parameter ρ is set as 2.81, 
as there are 128 sampling points for an extracting circle. 
Equation 1 generates a complex number )( 0uF . 
Subsequently an absolute value of )( 0uF is generated, 
which is used as an identifier to identify different hands. For 
equation 1, the exponential of e can be gradually increased 
whereby to create a new identifier.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 Results and conclusions 
The top of figure 3 shows the original hand images. 
In this study, there are 40 persons participate this test.  For 
each person, three different images were obtained from him. 
Actually, 120 images were used in this system. The hands of 
five different persons were designated as a batch to verify 
the system. Since three images per hand were taken, 15 were 
tested in each batch. 40 hands were tested in eight different 
batches, wherein one hand was compared with 14 others. Of 
the 105 comparisons conducted altogether, 15 were run for 
genuine comparisons, and the other 90 being comparisons of 
different. In table 1, the data inside the bold rectangular 
boxes represent comparisons of identical sources; the others, 
different sources. Table.2 and figure 4 summarize the results 
listed in table 1 for eight different batches encompassing 120 
genuine and 720 imposter tests. In table 2, the subtracted 
values of imposter comparisons are 27667049~ 12969747; 
whereas, identical, 15125783~8621516; the gap tolerance 
between the two is 0. Figure 4 shows the total comparison 
times for imposters as 720 with 24 errors; for identical 
comparisons, 120 with no error.

In this study, the new technique is used to extract the thumb, index, middle, and 
ring finger. Subsequently, the orientations of each finger are calculated. The 
geometry features of each finger are compared. Thus different persons are 
identified. The technique developed in this study works precisely to identify 
different persons. 
This study can automatically compute and examine the finger-edge energy response 
signals. Subsequently the higher ones are used to locate the finger-to-finger 
valleys and fingertips of a hand. The developed algorithm in this study can locate 
finger-to-finger valleys and fingertips very accurately and efficiently. For the 
previous survey technique, implicit polynomials are very difficult to describe 
the finger shape by the power of seven polynomial functions. This study uses the 
moment and centroid computation technique to solve the image rotation and shift 
problem. Each finger is rotated to the same orientation and position for 
comparison. 
This study also uses the following techniques to identify a finger (1) ring to 
line mapping technique to transfer the finger edge to straight-line signal, (2) 
rotation invariant transform is applied to the aforementioned straight-line signal 
to obtain the comparison data, (3) character matrix can be established after obtain
