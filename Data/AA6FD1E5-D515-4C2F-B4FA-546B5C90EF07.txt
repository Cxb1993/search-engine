II. CORRUGATED COUPLED STAGE 
Fig. 1(a) shows the layout of an Nth-order coupled-line 
BPF consisting of a cascade of N + 1 coupled stages. Once the 
filter specification, like order, bandwidth and ripple level, is 
given, the even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances of 
each stage can be determined by the well-known synthesis 
formulas [15] and hence the linewidth and the gap size can be 
known. Fig. 1(b) plots the corrugated stage under 
investigation. The periodic corrugation pattern has a period P, 
tooth width d, and tooth length T. Here, W = W0 + T/2, where 
W0 together with the gap S are those of a corresponding 
uniform stage given by the synthesis formulas. Let M be the 
number of corrugation periods in a stage. The total length of a 
stage is MP. 
For a periodic structure, the Bragg reflection condition is 
given as [14] 
 
2βP = 2nπ    (1) 
 
where β is the mean phase constant of the coupled section and 
n denotes the order of the bandgap. Considering to allocate 
the first bandgap, i.e., n = 1, at mfo, the corrugation period P 
can be derived as 
 
m
P
2
λ=     (2) 
 
where λ denotes the guided wavelength of the coupled lines at 
fo. Since the total length of the section is λ/4 at fo, we have 
 
m = 2M    (3) 
 
It means that if a bandgap centered at mfo is required, the stage 
should have m/2 periods. Thus, if number of periods M is 
changed, the center frequency of the bandgap will be changed 
accordingly. This makes a wide upper stopband possible since 
the bandgaps of all coupled sections can have different center 
frequencies. The rejection level and width of the bandgap, 
however, are still unknown, it is thus worth investigating the 
bandgap properties of the stages as follows. 
III. BANDSTOP PROPERTIES 
Herein, all stages under investigation are designed for a 
BPF filter operation at fo = 1 GHz. Fig. 2 investigates the 
center frequency control of the corrugated stages by using M 
= 3, 4, and 5 periods. The transmission responses (|S21|) show 
that their center frequencies are 6, 8 and 10 GHz. These 
results are consistent with the prediction by (2) and (3). Note 
that the case with M = 5 has the largest bandwidth. The 
bandwidth of the bandgap for M = 3 near 6fo, however, is still 
much larger than that of a single transmission zero close to 2fo 
or 4fo. One can observe that at fo, the larger the M value, the 
higher the coupling level of the coupled stage. At 2fo, the 
transmission zero guarantees that the electrical length of the 
corrugated stage is accurately determined.  
Fig. 3 studies the dependence of the bandgap characteristics 
on S for a stage with M = 4. The centers of the three bandgaps 
are accurately allocated at 8 GHz. At fo, the coupling levels 
significantly decreased when S is increased. When S = 0.673 
mm, the bandgap has the best rejection performance.

Fig. 7(a) plots the simulation and measured performances of 
the fabricated BPF. In the measured |S21| response, for a 30-dB 
level, the stopband is extended up to 11.8fo. The measured 
data show good agreement with the simulation. The reason 
why the |S21| levels near 2 and 3 GHz are not so good as those 
in the band over 5 ~ 7 GHz is that the suppression scheme 
relies on the inherent transmission zeros of a coupled stage 
which have a much narrower bandwidth than the previous 
bandgaps. Fig. 7(b) is the photograph of the measured BPF. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The bandgap characteristics of a coupled-line stage with 
periodic corrugation have been studied. Based on the Bragg 
reflection condition, the center frequencies of the bandgaps 
can be determined by number of periods in a quarter-wave 
stages at fo. It is found that narrow linewidth and long 
corrugation teeth are important design rules for creating a 
bandgap with satisfactory rejection level and bandwidth. Four 
corrugated stages are cascaded to build a third-order parallel-
coupled BPF with an upper stopband to 11.8fo.
