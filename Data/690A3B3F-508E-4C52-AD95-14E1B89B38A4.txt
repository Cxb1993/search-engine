英文摘要 
    Four kinds of norborene monomers containing pendent ester group are prepared by 
reacting 5-(hydroxy methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene and four kinds of the substituents 
of the carboxylic acid chloride. Novel pendent ester group homopolymers of 
5-(octanoate methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMO), 5-(decanoate  methyl) bicycle 
[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMD), 5-(dodecanoate methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMDO) 
and 5-(benzoate methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMB) have been synthesized by 
precision metathesis polymerization using Ru catalyst{Cl2Ru(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2}. 
These four polymers with molecular weight( Mn ) between 112,000 to 201,000 and  
polydispersities ( Mw / Mn =1.4-2.2) were prepared.  
    Novel random copolymers of 5-(trimethylsiloxymethyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene 
(NBMTMS) or 5-(phthalimide methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMPI) with NBMO 
have been synthesized by precision metathesis polymerization using Ru catalyst 
{Cl2Ru(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2}. After hydrolysis and hydrazinolysis of the random 
copolymers, the random copolymers containing functional hydroxyl group and 
functional amino group were also obtained. Molecular weight( Mn ) are between 
62,100 to 153,000  and  polydispersity index are between 1.73 and 6.21. The 
temperatures of 10 % weight loss of these random copolymers were in the range of 255
－355 ℃ and were highly soluble in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, 
dichloromethane, benzene, xylene and toluene. Novel cross-linkable random 
copolymers were prepared from random copolymers containing functional hydroxyl 
group and functional amino group with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl isocyanate (MOI). 
Reaction of this multifunctionalized methacryloyl polymer with methyl methacrylate 
(MMA) under free-radical polymerization conditions has led to the formation of AB 
cross-linked system. The thermal stability of AB cross-linked material of poly(MMA) 
and random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) [decomposition temperature (Td10%) =367 ℃ 
in nitrogen] was enhanced by 42 ℃ compared with poly(MMA) (Td10% = 325 ℃ in 
nitrogen). 
    Novel amphiphilic random and block copolymers were obtained by precision 
metathesis polymerization of ester-bridged monomer (Nano-scale polymeric materials) , 
NBMO and NBMPI by using Ru catalyst. Highly stable copolynorbornenes containing 
hydrophilic ammonium salt and hydrophobic alkyl ester group (Nano-scale polymeric 
materials) were obtained by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), 
hydrogenation, hydrazinolysis, and subsequent quaternization. Various random 
copolymers with varying compositions of bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2-methyl octanoate 
(NBMO) and 5-(phthalimide methyl)-bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMPI) were 
synthesized to control the interaction and microstructure of aggregates via ROMP. The 
formation, structure, and morphologies of the aggregates were investigated. The 
association of polymer molecules in water were be confirmed by fluorescence 
spectroscopy. The size and morphologies of aggregates were characterized by scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
Nanometer-scale polymeric micelles having a uniform distribution of such random 
copolymers with 50-75 mol % of ammonium salts and 50-25 mol % of alkyl ester group 
were obtained, and their sizes were characterized by SEM (6.8-18.1 nm) and TEM 
(5.0-13.7 nm).

第一年度 
Synthesis of Ester-Containing Norbornenes 
Ester derivatives of 5-(octanoate methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMO),5- 
(decanoate methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene(NBMD),5-(dodecanoate methyl) bicycle 
[2.2.1]hept-2-ene(NBMDO),and 5-(benzoatemethyl) bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMB) 
were prepared according to earlier literature  
(Table 1).22,23 
 
General Procedure of ROMP of Various Monomer(s) 
A solution of catalyst was prepared by dissolving metathesis catalyst 1 (3 mg, 3.6 x  
10-3 mmol) in 1 mL of anhydrous methylene chloride in an argon-filled dry box. The 
monomer(s) (0.8 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of methylene chloride and then 
degassed via a freeze-pump-thaw cycle. After degassing the monomer(s) solution 
completely, the catalyst solution was injected into the monomer(s) solution by a syringe. 
The reaction was performed at 30℃  for 2h. The polymerization reaction was 
terminated by the addition of a small amount of ethyl vinyl ether (0.2 mL) and 
homo/copolymer were obtained by precipitating in excess methanol. The yields of the 
polymers were in the range of 72 and 94%.

Random Copolymer of NBMO and NBMTMS 
[Scheme. 1 (a)]. 
 
The 5-(trimethylsiloxy methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBMTMS) (44–46 ℃ /2 
mmHg, endo/exo = 82:18) was prepared by the reaction of 5-(hydroxy methyl) 
bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene with an equimolar solution of trimethylchlorosilane and 
triethylamine in diethyl ether.24 A solution of catalyst was prepared by dissolving 
metathesis catalyst {Cl2Ru(CHPh)[P(C6H11)3]2} (5 mg, 6.1x10-3 mmol) in 1 mL of 
anhydrous methylene chloride in an argon-filled dry box. The monomers, NBMO (0.2 g, 
0.8 mmol) and NBMTMS (157 mg, 0.08 mmol), were dissolved in 10 mL of methylene 
chloride and then degassed via a freeze-pump-thaw cycle. After degassing the monomer 
solution completely, the catalyst solution was injected into the monomer solution by a 
syringe. The polymerization was performed at 30 ℃ for 2 h. The color of the solution 
changed from pink to yellow after 10 min when the reaction was performed at 30 ℃. 
The reaction was terminated by the addition of a small amount of ethyl vinyl ether (0.2 
mL) and random copolymer [random poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS)] was obtained by 
precipitating in excess methanol (300 mL). The white-colored polymer was further 
purified by dissolving it in methylene chloride and re-precipitating it with methanol and 
drying it overnight under vacuum at ambient temperature. The yield of random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS) was 86%. The IR spectrum of random poly (NBMO 
-co-NBMTMS) exhibited bands at 1730 and 1102 cm-1 due to stretching of carbonyl and

31.69 (C10), 34.46 (C9), 35.83–44.39 (C1, C10, C4, C40, C5, C50, C6, C60, C7 and C7’), 
66.09–66.98 (C8 and C8’), 129.54–134.84 (C2, C2’, C3 and C3’), 173.88 (C16)  
[Figure 1 b]. 
 
Hydrazinolysis of Random Poly(NBMO-co-NBMPI) 
[Scheme. 1 (b) and 2 (g)]. 
 
Random poly(NBMO-co-NBMPI) (0.4 g, 1.60 mmol) was suspended in 15 mL of 
ethanol in Schlenk tube. To the above mixture, 5 mL of hydrazine monohydrate was 
added. The mixture was degassed via a freeze-pump-thaw cycle, then the tube was 
heated to 100℃. Hydrazinolysis was performed for 12 h, and then the solution was 
cooled to room temperature. The random copolymer with amine group, random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMA) was precipitated in excess methanol (yield = 83%). 1H NMR 
(500 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 0.87–0.90 (H15; 3H), 1.10–3.00 (H1, H10, H4, H4’, H5, H5’, 
H6, H6’, H7, H7’ and H9–H14; 26H), 3.87–4.04 (H8 and H8’; 4H), 5.22–5.46 (H2, H2’, 
H3, H3’ and H9’; 6H). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): 14.07 (C15), 22.59 (C14), 
25.01 (C13), 28.94 (C12), 29.14 (C11), 31.67 (C10), 34.45 (C9), 35.80–44.19 (C1, C10, C4, 
C4’, C5, C5’, C6, C6’, C7 and C7’), 66.06–66.90 (C8 and C8’), 129.50–134.83 (C2, C2’, 
C3 and C3’), 173.87 (C16). 
 
Modification of Random Poly(NBMO-co-NBMOH) and Random Poly(NBMO– 
co-NBMA) 
[Scheme. 1 (a) and (b)]. 
 
Random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOH) and random poly(NBMO-co-NBMA) were 
modified by reaction with MOI. A mixture of 0.25 g of polymer and 0.025 g of MOI 
was dissolved in 15 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), and continuously stirred at room 
temperature for 4 h. The modified random copolymers were then precipitated in excess 
methanol. The yields of modified random copolymers, random poly(NBMO-co-NBMO 
AC) and random poly(NBMO-co-NBMUAC) were in the range of 79 and 84%. 
 
Random Poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) 
[Scheme. 1 (a) and 2 (d)]. 
 
The IR spectrum of random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) exhibited an absorption band 
at 1645 cm-1 due to C=C of vinylic group of acryloyl moiety. 1H NMR (500 MHz, 
CDCl3, ppm): 0.87–0.89 (H15; 3H), 1.20–3.00 (H1, H1’,H4, H4’, H5, H5’, H6, H6’, H7, H7’, 
H12’, and H9–H14; 29H), 3.48 (H10’; 2H), 3.86–4.03 (H8 and H8’; 4H), 4.22 (H11’; 2H), 
5.21–5.34 (H2, H2’, H3,H3’, and H9’; 5H), 5.59 and 6.12 (H13’; 2H). 13C NMR(125 MHz, 
CDCl3, ppm): 14.09 (C15), 18.33 (C12’), 22.62 (C14), 25.03 (C13), 28.96 (C12), 29.17 
(C11), 31.69 (C10), 34.46 (C9), 35.82–46.50 (C1,C1’, C4, C4’, C5, C5’, C6, C6’, C7, C7’ and 
C10’), 63.74 (C11’), 66.09–66.95 (C8 and C8’), 126.00(C13’), 129.51–136.00 (C2, C2’, C3, 
C3’ and C14’), 167.24 (C15’), 173.88 (C16’and C16) [Figure 1 c]. 
 
Random Poly(NBMO-co-NBMUAC) 
[Scheme. 1 (c) and 2 (h)]. 
 
The IR spectrum of random poly(NBMO-co-NBMUAC) exhibited an absorption band

Hydrogenation, Hydrazinolysis, and Quaternization of Poly(NBMPI-b-NBMO) 
(Scheme 3) 
 
Hydrogenation of poly(NBMPI-b-NBMO)-3 was conducted in a typical experiment by 
using p-toluenesulfonhydrazide as hydrogenating agent as described in the previous 
reaction. The yield of poly(HNBMPI-b-HNBMO)-3 was 88%. In the 1H NMR (500 
MHz, CDCl3) spectrum of poly(HNBMPI-b-HNBMO)-3, the peak at δ (ppm) 5.2–5.6 
(olefinic) present in the reactant NMR spectrum had disappeared. The yield of 
quaternized block copolymer, poly(HNBMQ-b-HNBMO)-3, was 75%.

organosoluble random poly(NBMO-co-SNBMOAC), the vinylic proton peaks of 
crosslinkable methacryloyl moiety were observed at δ (ppm) 5.60 and 6.13. The content 
of crosslinkable moiety in the organosoluble random poly(NBMO-co-SNBMOAC) was 
calculated to be 3.6% by 1H NMR. Random poly(NBMO-co-SNBMOAC) was soluble 
in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, dichloromethane, 
1,2-dichlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, and xylene. It is difficult to control the reaction 
time to get organosoluble and crosslinkable polymer by saponification of poly(NBMO). 
Another route should be considered by ring-opening metathesis copolymerization of 
NBMO and NBMTMS. Random poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS) could be obtained via 
ROMP of NBMO and NBMTMS. The 1H NMR spectrum of random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS) shows resonances due to the olefinic resonance protons of 
the polymer at δ (ppm) 5.21–5.47 [Figure 1a]. The content of trimethylsilyl moiety in 
the random poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS) was calculated to be 12% by 1H NMR. 
Hydrolysis of random poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS) was performed under acidic 
conditions to remove the trimethylsilyl protecting groups and to unmask the alcohol 
functionalities. Characterization of the hydrolyzed random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOH) 
by the 1H NMR spectroscopy [Figure 1b] indicated disappearance of signals at δ (ppm) 
0.07–0.09 due to –O-Si-(CH3)3 and appearance of a new broad signal at δ (ppm) 3.33 
due to hydroxyl group confirmed the complete removal of the trimethylsilyl group from 
the polymer. After modification of random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOH) by reacting with 
MOI, random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) [Scheme 1(c)] was obtained. In the 1H NMR 
(500 MHz, CDCl3) spectrum of random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC)[Figure 1c], 
resonance signals of vinylic protons of MOI moiety were observed at δ (ppm) 5.59 and 
6.12. In the 13C NMR spectrum of random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC), the signal at δ 
(ppm) 126.00 [-O-C(O)-C(CH3)=CH2] was observed due to the carbon of vinylene units 
of the methacryloyl group of the side chains. The IR spectrum of random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) showed a new absorption band at 1645 cm-1 due to C=C 
vinylic group, and band due to hydroxyl group had disappeared in the IR spectrum of 
product. The content of methacryloyl moiety in the random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) 
was calculated to be 12% by 1H NMR. The chemical transformation from hydroxy 
group to methacryloyl group has been achieved completely.All the polymers were 
highly soluble in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, dichloromethane, 
1,2-dichlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, xylene and insoluble in DMSO. GPC curves of 
random poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS),random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOH), and random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) were broad and unimodal molecular weight distribution 
with a shoulder. The GPC curve of random poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS) with broader 
PDI value( Mn = 1.48 x 105, PDI = 4.32) than poly(NBMO) (PDI =1.9, Table 2) was 
observed. It might be attributable to the difference in the reactivity of two nonliving 
monomers, NBMO and NBMTMS. The GPC curve of random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMOH) showed a clear decrease in polymer molecular weight and 
PDI value ( Mn = 1.45 x105, PDI = 2.91) after deprotection, consistent with loss of the 
bulky trimethylsilyl group. Furthermore, random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOH) was 
modified by reacting with MOI and the random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) with 
flexible ethyl methacrylate group side chain was obtained. Random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC)( Mn  = 1.53 x105, PDI = 4.37 ) with relative high 
molecular weight and broad GPC curve containing a shoulder might be attributable to 
incorporation of the flexible ethyl methacrylate group in side chain and some sort of 
aggregation phenomenon caused by hydrogen bonding interaction between amide and 
carboxyl groups.25,26 Random poly(NBMO-co-NBMTMS), random poly(NBMO- 
co-NBMOH), and random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) exhibited 10% weight loss at 
 16
organosoluble and crosslinkable copolymer, random poly(NBMO-co-NBMUAC), was 
obtained after modification with MOI. The modified copolymer exhibited lower thermal 
stability, which might be attributed to the ester thermal decomposition of flexible ethyl 
methacrylate group in the side chain of polymer.32 Similar solubility of random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMPI), random poly(NBMO-co-NBMA), and random poly 
(NBMO-co-NBMUAC) was shown and the polymers were highly soluble in common 
organic solvents, such as THF, chloroform, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 
benzene, xylene, toluene, and DMAc but partially soluble in DMSO and DMF. 
 
AB Cross-linked Systems of Random Poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) and Poly(MMA) 
 
The incorporation of random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) into poly(MMA) by forming 
networked polymer was considered to be a strategy to improve thermal stability and 
chemical resistance of poly(MMA). Polymerization of MMA in the presence of random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) afforded poly(MMA) crosslinked with random 
poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC), thus yielding AB cross-linked material.29 The solubility of 
the cross-linked polymer was insoluble in THF, ethanol, acetone, benzene, toluene, and 
chloroform. The thermal stability of AB cross-linked material of poly(MMA) and 
random poly(NBMO-co-NBMOAC) [decomposition temperature (Td10%=367 ℃  in 
nitrogen] was enhanced by 42 ℃ compared with poly(MMA) (Td10% = 325 ℃ in 
nitrogen).

Amphiphilic block copolymer has attracted attention because it can form various 
nanostructures, such as micelles or nanoparticles by self assembling in the selective 
solvent or monolayers by adsorption at the air–liquid interface.33–36 In general, 
structures of the micelles or nanoparticles strongly depend on the hydrophilic–
hydrophobic balance and polymer architecture as well as the polymer concentration, salt 
concentration, temperature, solvent pH, and so on.33–36 To comprehensively investigate 
the self-assembling behavior of amphiphilic block copolymers, it is necessary to prepare 
polymer samples with well-controlled molecular weight of hydrophobic and hydrophilic 
segment and sufficiently high chemical stability. The morphology of nanoparticles 
derived from amphiphilic block copolymer, poly(HNBMQ-b-HNBMO)-1, was 
characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Diameters of nanoparticles of 
poly(HNBMQ-b-HNBMO)-1 (x = 500, y = 100 in theory and x =491, y = 270 by GPC, 
Figure 4) (15–25 nm) [Figure 3B] and poly(HNBMQ-b-HNBMO)-3 (x = 50, y=50 in 
theory and x = 51, y = 31 by GPC, Scheme 3) (11–20 nm)[Figure 3C] were in the 
range of 11–25 nm by SEM. SEM micrographs of block copolymers with higher 
hydrophobic and hydrophilic segmental lengths such as poly(HNBMQ-b-HNBMO)-2 
indicated slightly larger nanoparticles (15– 25 nm). Another block copolymer, 
poly(HNBMQ-b-HNBMO)-3, with shorter hydrophobic and hydrophilic segmental 
lengths showed slightly smaller nanoparticles (11–20 nm) in their SEM micrograph. 
 
Chacterization of Various Random Copolymers [Random Poly(NBMO-co-NBMPI)]. 
Random poly(NBMO-co-NBMPI)s exhibited unimodal molecular weight distribution 
curves. When the content of NBMPI increased from 50 to 80 mol % in the random 
copolymerization system, the nature of GPC curve becomes a broad molecular weight 
 18
1H NMR; Scheme 3) was soluble in ethanol and only partially soluble in water and 
methanol; hence, cmc could not be measured in aqueous solution. The cmc of 
poly(HNBMO-co-HNBMQ)-4 (fHNBMQ(th) = 80 mol %; fHNBMQ(exp) = 76.6 mol % by 1H 
NMR; Scheme 3) could not be observed due to relatively high ammonium salt content 
and low surface activity. It is interesting to find the individual micelles of random 
copolymers with composition range from 50 to 75 mol % ammonium salt (fHNBMQ) in 
SEM and TEM micrographs as isolated nanometer-scale spherical, and their average 
diameters were in the range of 6.8-18.1 nm in SEM and 5.0-13.7 nm in TEM 
micrographs. Nanometer-scale polymeric micelles having a uniform distribution of such 
random copolymers with 50-75 mol % of ammonium salts and 50-25 mol % of alkyl 
ester group were obtained. These results indicate that the intrapolymer aggregates 
formed by the random copolymer might be due to the formation of unimer (Figure 6A) 
depending on the molar ratio of hydrophobic group/hydrophilic group. When 
ammonium salt content (fHNBMQ) was increased more than 80 mol% (fHNBMQ(exp) = 76.6 
mol% by 1H NMR), the micelle morphology changed from spherical to network-like 
aggregates (Figure 6B) which is due to hydrophobically cross-linked chains of 
interpolymers. 
 
Micelles observation of block polymers 
DLS (dynamic light scattering) measurement of micelles in ethanol was performed and 
hydrodynamic radius was calculated as shown in Figure 7. The hydrodynamic radius 
(Rh) of poly(HNBMQ100-b-HNBMO100) (fHNBMQ(th) =50 mol% ; fHNBMQ(exp)= 51 mol% 
by GPC) in ethanol decreases as the concentration of poly(HNBMQ100-b-HNBMO100) 
increases, and then reaches a steady value about 160 nm at 3.2 x10-2 g dL-1. In our 
previous study,38 the poly(HNBMO) was insoluble in ethanol. However, quaternized 
block copolymer poly(HNBMQ100-b-HNBMO100) could be soluble in ethanol. 
Therefore, the difference of solubility resulted from the quaternized hydrophilic 
segments of polymer. In general, the polymer allows each segment to interact with its 
favored environment. The polymer can form aggregates in which the hydrophobic 
segments were oriented within the micelle and the hydrophilic segments were exposed 
to the solvent. If the size of micelles was controlled by the concentration of hydrophobic 
segments, larger size of micelles could be expected to form at higher concentration. 
However, the results are contradictory from DLS measurement, in which the size of 
micelles keeps constant beyond concentration of 3.2 x 10-2 g dL-1. Accordingly, the 
hydrodynamic radius of the cationic polymer in ethanol solution could result from 
electrostatic repulsive forces balance between intra- and intermicelles39. As 
hydrophobic segments aggregate, the cations will be located at the surroundings of the 
micelles. When polymer concentration is increased, the repulsive electrostatic forces 
between micelles increase and then reduce the size of micelles resulted so that the 
repulsive forces within intramicelles increase. Consequently, the size of micelles might 
reach a stable size due to the balance of electrostatic repulsive forces of intra- and 
inter-micelle. Figure 8 shows the TEM micrographs of the micelles of 
poly(HNBMQ100-b-HNBMO100), which was prepared from a polymer ethanol solution 
at the concentration of 0.02 g dL-1. The dark core regions correspond to hydrophobic 
segment of HNBMO in poly(HNBMQ100-b-HNBMO100). It can be seen from Figure 8. 
that poly(HNBMQ100-b-HNBMO100) micelle is roughly spherical in shape. The average 
diameter of cores calculated from the TEM micrograph (Figure 8) is ca. 224 nm (radius 
112 nm). From the DLS result (Figure 7), the hydrodynamic radius of poly 
(HNBMQ100-b-HNBMO100) in ethanol at 0.02 g dL-1 is 240 nm. The hydrodynamic 
diameter of micelles in ethanol solution measured by DLS is more than twice as large as 
the diameter calculated from TEM. This variation could be resulted from the influence 
 20
critical polymer concentration, which is defined as a critical micelle concentration 
(CMC) for micelle-forming polymers27. When fHNBMQ is increased from 67 to 75 mol%, 
all polymers in water exist as self-assembly unimeric micelles. The results of TEM and 
fluorescence spectroscopy on the micelles of different random copolymers containing 
various contents of ammonium salt in aqueous are summarized in Table 4. For the 
polymers in cosolvent, CMCs are not observed even at high concentration.When fHNBMQ 
is further increased to 80 mol%, polymer chains form much larger aggregates, which are 
different from that of the copolymer with fHNBMQ less than 75 mol%. The structure of 
aggregates changed from spheres to network-like aggregates due to hydrophobically 
cross-linked chains. In this case, no critical micelle concentration was observed (Table 
4 and Figure 9A). Unfortunately, random poly(HNBMQ250-r-HNBMO250) with 
fHNBMQ(th) = 50 mol% ( fHNBMQ(exp) = 48.7 mol%) was soluble in ethanol and only 
partially soluble in water and methanol; hence, CMC could not be measured in aqueous 
solution. The fluorescence spectral data of random and block copolymers with the same 
fHNBMQ(th) = 91 mol% at various concentrations are presented in (Figure 11). The block 
copolymer (poly(HNBMQ1000-b-HNBMO100) exhibited lower critical aggregation 
concentration (CAC = 2.5x10-4gdL-1) than that of the random copolymer 
(poly(HNBMQ1000 -r-HNBMO100) (CAC = 5.0x10-2 gdL-1). Furthermore, it can be seen 
that the block copolymer exhibited a well defined CMC at a concentration of 4.0 x 10-2 
g dL-1 . while CMC was not observed for the random copolymer even at high 
concentration (3.2 g dL-1). This study clearly demonstrates that the block copolymer 
[block poly(HNBMQ1000-b-HNBMO100)] with block hydrophobic and hydrophilic 
segments has much tendency to undergo association and to form micelles than 
corresponding random copolymer[random poly(HNBMQ1000-r-HNBMO100)]. (Figure 
12.) displays emission spectra of the cationic random poly(HNBMQ500-r-HNBMO250) 
(fHNBMQ(exp) = 67.2 mol%) at different polymer concentrations of 5.6 x 10-4 [CAC, 
(Figure 12A.)], 5.7 x 10-1 [higher than CAC, Figure 8B] and 0.1 g dL-1 [CMC, Figure 
8C] of pyrene molecules in the presence and absence of the polymers in aqueous 
solution. Monomer emission of pyrene could be observed in the range from 377 to 385 
nm and the excimer emission could be observed in the range from 450 to 480 nm. The 
peak maximum at 377 nm arises from the fluorescence emission of isolated 
pyrenes(monomer emission). The broad band centered around 450 nm results from 
emission of excited dimeric pyrene (excimer emission). (Figure 9.) plots IE/IM as a 
function of polymer concentration in water (Figure 9A.) and in ethanol/methylene 
chloride cosolvent [ethanol/methylene chloride = 2/1 (v/v)] (Figure 9B.)The association 
of pyrene hardly exists, and IE/IM almost keeps unchanged when the polymers are at low 
concentrations. As the polymer concentration increases, the degree of excimer 
formation increases the population of excited pyrene dimers, which results in IE/IM 
increase 41. For the aqueous system shown in (Figure 9A.), the IE/IM curves depend on 
the composition of polymers. The IE/IM increases rapidly at 0.01 g dL-1 (log Cp=2.0) for 
poly (HNBMQ500-r-HNBMQ250) and 0.2 gdL-1 (log Cp = 0.7) for poly (HNBMQ750- 
r-HNBMQ250). For the hydrophilic contents lower than 80 mol%, the excimer formation 
is at higher concentration for the polymer with higher hydrophilic content. While the 
IE/IM value increases rapidly at 0.016 gdL-1 (log Cp = 1.8) for poly (HNBMQ1000- 
r-HNBMO250), which is lower than that of poly (HNBMQ750-r-HNBMQ250). This 
variation might result from the different morphologies of polymer micelles. These 
results are in agreement with the conceptual illustration of self-assembly micelles 
(Figure 10). For the cosolvent system as shown in (Figure 9B.), the IE/IM curves of the 
random polymers are almost the same. The random copolymers begin to associate, and 
as a result, the IE/IM value increases rapidly at 0.1 g dL-1 (log Cp = -1), indicating that 
strong association occurs. Pyrene molecules are hydrophobic and easier to be embraced

A series of functional homopolymers were prepared and characterized using IR, NMR, 
and GPC methods. Thermal stability of protected, deprotected, and modified polymers 
was evaluated. Polymers with protection and after deprotection exhibited good thermal 
stability. 
 
 
第二年度 
Several random and block copolynorbornenes with side chains containing terminal 
hydroxyl, amino, methacryloyl or ammonium groups were derived from the functional 
alkyl ester-containing norbornenes by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). 
The main chain of ROMP-type polynorbornene had a more important role for 
glass-transition temperature in comparison with vinyl addition polymerization. There is 
little effect on glass-transition temperature (about -39℃) of polynorbornenes with 
different length of alkyl side chain. The organosoluble copolynorbornenes with active 
crosslinkable methylacryloyl side chains derived from functional hydroxyl group were 
prepared to improve the thermal stability of poly(methyl methacrylate)decomposition 
temperature (Td10% = 325 ℃ in nitrogen) by forming networked AB cross-linked 
polymer (Td10% = 367 ℃ in nitrogen). 
 
 
第三年度 
A series of novel polynorbornene copolymers with self assembly amphiphilic 
architecture containing hydrophilic ammonium salt and hydrophobic alkyl ester group 
were obtained via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Spherical micelles 
of such polynorbornenes are formed in an ethanol/methylene chloride (2/1) solution by 
varying the content of ammonium salts from 50 to 75 mol% of random copolymers. 
When the hydrophilic content of the random copolymer is higher than 80 mol%, the 
morphology of micelles transferred into network-like aggregates. Block copolymer has 
much tendency to undergo association and form micelles than the corresponding 
random copolymer. The topology of such amphiphilic copolymers having highly stable 
polynorbornene main chains makes them attractive for nanomaterial applications.
