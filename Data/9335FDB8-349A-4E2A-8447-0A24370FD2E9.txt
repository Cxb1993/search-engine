satellite has failed at a specified time and if the range 
measurements associated to the failed one is not yet 
excluded, the positioning result of the vehicle becomes 
inaccuracy and even unusable. To solve this, an algorithm 
based on multiple model (MM) approach is proposed. MM is 
a well known approach adopted in target tracking. The basic 
idea behind MM is to assume a set of models as possible 
candidates of the true model. The set of candidate models 
then generates overall estimates by running a bank of 
Kalman filters. Since the true model is among the set of 
possible candidates, the correct positioning result will be 
figured out. From that, the range measurements associated to 
the failed satellite can be identified. 
Linearization of the Ionosphere-Free Measurement 
Model 
  The modernized GPS receiver can provide two different 
types of ionosphere-free measurements: the pseudorange 
measurement and the delta range measurement 
. Assume the reference point  is the vector 
comprised of the nominal user position plus the nominal user 
clock drift. Then the linearization of and

can be obtained as

( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( ) ( )[ ] ( )kkkkkkkkkk refrefGIF ωxxHxxHdd +−−−−−−+−−= 1111φ (2) 
 
where  is the ( )kd n×1 predicted range vector based on the 
reference point ;  is the ( )krefx ( )kH n×4 observation matrix 
arrived at by linearizing around ;  is the 4×1 state 
vector comprised of the true position, plus the user clock 
drift; 
( )krefx ( )kx
( )kw  is the n×1 pseudorange measurement noises, 
and is assumed to be zero mean white Gaussian with the n×n 
covariance matrix ;  is the n×1 delta range 
measurement noises, and is assumed to be zero mean white 
Gaussian with the n×n covariance matrix ; n is the 
number of visible satellites.

Using Delta Range Equation for a Maneuvering Vehicle 
As a moving vehicle accelerates or slows down furiously, 
or as the vehicle corners at faster speeds, the conventional 
PVA model without using extra sensors can no longer be 
adequate for describing the motion of the vehicle.  
Therefore, the positioning result of the vehicle will become 
less accurate. Moreover, the normalized innovation squared 
will deviate from the chi-square distribution and is no longer 
suitable as the test statistic for FDE. To overcome this 
problem, the delta range (DR) equation is adopted as the 
dynamic equation for the Kalman filter. 
A. Positioning Algorithm 
According to (4), the delta range equation can be described 
as 
 
  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )u kkkkkk ωxHxH +−− 11  = −
 
Suppose that there are at least four visible satellites, i.e., 
the rank of ( )kH  is equal to its column dimension. Next, 
assume ( )kL  is a 4×n matrix satisfying that ( ) ( ) 4IHL =kk , 
where  is the 4×4 identity matrix. Multiply 4I ( )kL  on both 
sides of (4), and then the following equation can be derived 
 
  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )kkkkkk DRDR vxΦxuL −−−= 1           (5) 
 
where ( ) ( ) ( )1−= kkkDR HLΦ  is the 4×4 transition matrix, 
and ( ) ( ) ( )kkkDR ωLv −=  is the 4×1 noise vector, assumed 
to be zero mean white Gaussian with the covariance matrix 
( ) =kDRQ  ( ) ( ) ( )kkk TLΩL . 
To give a simple form of ( )kDRQ , we can select ( )kL  as 
 
  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( )kkkkkk TT 111 −−−= ΩHHΩHL           (6) 
 
Then the covariance matrix  can be derived as ( )kDRQ
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) 11 −−= kkkk TDR HΩHQ . As a result, ( )kDRQ  will have a 
simpler form if ( )kL  is chosen as in (6). 
 
  By applying (3) and (5) to the Kalman filter, a moving 
vehicle can be described by the following dynamic and 
measurement equations

Simulation Results 
  Two simulations are conducted to verify the proposed 
algorithms. In the first simulation, it is assumed that the 
vehicle will first complete a half circle at a specified time 
and then slows down rapidly at another time. The goal of 
this simulation is to verify that the proposed DR can still 
perform both positioning and FDE well as a vehicle 
maneuvers. In the second simulation, it is assumed that one 
of the visible satellites is failed at and remained after a 
specified time. The goal of this simulation is to verify that 
the proposed MM can reduce the positioning error to a 
reasonable range as a satellite is failed. In these two 
simulations, the software package “Satellite Navigation 
ToolBox 2.0 for Matlab,” by GPSoft LLC is adopted. It 
assumed a 24-satellite constellation with perfectly circular 
orbits. For each satellite, the dual frequency is used to 
eliminate the ionospheric delay. In addition, the receiver 
mask angle is set as 7.5°. 
 
A. Using Delta Range Equation for a Maneuvering              
Vehicle 
  Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to verify that the 
proposed DR can still perform positioning and FDE as the 
vehicle maneuvers. In this simulation, both algorithms, PVA 
and DR, are applied to a vehicle which followed a constant 
course with a constant velocity 250m/s along the x-axis until 
time k = 100 seconds, at which point it began to maneuver in 
uniform circular motion with a radius of 12.5 kilometers and 
a centripetal acceleration of 5m/s2 until time k = 257.0796 
seconds, at which point it completed a half circle. Then the 
vehicle followed a constant course with a constant velocity 
-250m/s along the x-axis until time k = 400 seconds, at 
which point it began to accelerate with a constant 
acceleration -2.5m/s2 along the z-axis until time k = 440 
seconds, at which point it began to course with a constant 
velocity -250m/s along the x-axis and -100m/s along the 
z-axis. According to the vehicle course described above, a 
total of 500 sample points were produced. Moreover, for 
each sample point, an estimated positioning result can be 
obtained. Furthermore, the norm of estimated positioning 
error ( )kposx~  can be calculated through the following 
equation 
 
  ( ) ( ) ( )kkˆk~ truepospos xxx −=                   (7) 
 
where ( )kposxˆ  is the 3×1 estimated position vector and 
( )ktruex  is the 3×1 true position vector. 
 
  The simulation results of applying the PVA and DR are 
plotted in Figure 3. It shows that, in comparison with the PVA 
model, the proposed DR equation possesses more accurate 
positioning results as a moving vehicle accelerates or slows 
down furiously, or as the vehicle corners at faster speeds. In 
addition, the NIS from the DR equation will still be 
chi-square distributed. Therefore, in comparison with the
