Wave Propagation in Chiral Medium 
1. Introduction 
 The wave phenomena associated with the class of bi-isotropic (BI) materials had 
attracted great interests for over two decades, and theoretical formulations and 
suggestions for potential applications had been put forward in literature [1].  In the 
past, efforts have been focused on the development of equivalent parameters in order 
to treat a BI medium as an isotropic one.  In this paper, we present a new approach to 
the propagation of uniform plane wave in BI media.  Firstly, we employ the 
technique of Scalarization to simplify the Maxwell equations in vector form to 
become a set of scalar ones, and then introduce the concept of perturbation analysis to 
exhibit the effect of the bi-isotropy on the wave characteristics in general.  The 
method of analysis is based on the development of the dispersion relation of a BI 
medium, so that the result obtained are cast in a concise form and will appear as an 
extension of well known ones of isotropic media.  In particular, the familiar 
technique of equivalent circuit is developed to enhance the understanding of the wave 
phenomena associated with BI media. 
2. Scalarization of Maxwell equations 
For the electromagnetic fields of the time variation, ejωt, the Maxwell equations 
for electromagnetic waves propagating in a bi-isotropic medium are written as: 
 EjHjE ωξωμ −−=×∇  (1a) 
 HjEjH ωζωε +=×∇  (1a) 
where μ and ε are the permeability and permittivity of the medium, and ξ and ζ are 
the BI coefficients.  Based on the law of energy conservation, it is required that the 
bi-isotropic coefficients be generally expressed by: ξ = ζ∗ = τ + jχ, where τ is the 
Tellegen coefficient and χ is the chirality coefficient.  For the sake of mathematical 
curiosity, we shall leave all the parameters μ, ε, ξ and ζ arbitrary, and then impose any 
physical requirements whenever needed.  In this way, we can explore the 
consequences of physical as well as non-physical situations. 
With respect to a fixed direction to be referred to as the longitudinal direction, 
say along the z-axis, a vector may be decomposed as: 
 zot AzAA +=  (2) 
where At is the two-dimensional transverse vector and Az is the longitudinal

where the coefficient dyadics, Z , P , Y , and Q , are defined in Table 1, together 
with the parameters in the row of remarks.  We observe that all these coefficient 
dyadics are commutative to one anther, and they share the same set of eigenvectors.  
By inspection, if 0≠tk , the eigenvectors are:

As shown, these two vectors are normalized to unity and they are orthogonal to each 
other.  The eigenvalues of each coefficient dyadic can be easily obtained by the 
direct scalar-multiplication of each dyadic with each of the two eigenvectors.  The 
results are summarized altogether in Table 1.  The special case of kt = 0 will be 
treated subsequently as a limiting case of the general formulation to follow.. 
With the set of orthonormal eigenvectors so determined, the electric and 
magnetic field vectors can be represented as: 
 2211 )()()( uzVuzVzEz to +=×  (8a) 
 2211 )()()( uzIuzIzH t +=  (8b) 
where the V’s describe the amplitude variations of the electric field along the 
z-direction and the I’s describe those of the magnetic field.  Substituting the 
expressions in the last two equations into those in (6), we obtain a set of four scalar 
equations, as: 
 21111 VPkIZkVdz
dj zz +=  (9a) 
 12222 VPkIZkVdz
dj zz −=  (9b) 
 21111 IQkVYkIdz
dj zz −=  (9c) 
 12222 IQkVYkIdz
dj zz +=  (9d) 
Thus, the Maxwell equations in vector form are reduced to the scalar ones for a given

for m = 1 and 2.  These are recognized as the governing equations for a lossless 
transmission line with the distributed inductance L = μ and distributed capacitance C 
= ε.  V and I are interpreted as the modal voltage and modal current of a TEM mode, 
respectively.  For simplicity, such a set of governing equations will be referred to as 
the “simple” transmission-line equations. 
Skipping the detailed analysis, the general solutions for the lossless transmission 
lines are given by:

where the characteristic exponent and wave admittance are determined by:

It is noted that (11c) is the well known dispersion relation for the simple medium.  
Physically, the general solutions in (11a) and (11b) consist of forward and backward 
traveling waves, both propagating with the same propagation constant and wave 
impedance regardless of their directions of propagation, because of the isotropic 
nature of the medium.  It is emphasized that the two sets of transmission-line 
equations are independent of each other; this means that the TEM mode is a 
degenerate case of the TM and TE modes in a linear, homogeneous and isotropic 
medium.. 
4. Bi-isotropic medium 
Now, return back to the general case of BI medium with non-vanishing ξ and ζ.  
The equations in (9) can be interpreted as two coupled sets of the transmission-line 
equations.  Alternatively, the last term in each equation in (9) is due to the effect of 
perturbation by the bi-isotropy, and may be regarded as an equivalent source along the 
simple transmission lines for the unperturbed simple medium.  Because the 
equivalent sources depend on the local field strength, they belong to the class of 
dependent sources, as shown in Fig. 1.  It is noted that the polarities of the dependent 
sources will affect the wave propagation in the two opposite directions; such an

two opposite directions, as in the general case in Fig, 1.  By taking the Fourier 
transformation on the last two equations, we obtain the algebraic equations: 
 mmm VYI =   (15a) 
 mmm IZV =  (15b) 
where Ym and Zm are defined by: 
 [ ]ωξωμ jkY mm )1(1 −+=  (16a) 
 [ ]ωζωε jkZ mm )1(1 −−=  (16b) 
The two equations in (15) relate the same set of voltage and current in reverse order.  
In order for Ym and Zm to be interpreted as the wave admittance and wave impedance, 
respectively, they must be reciprocal to each other, or they must satisfy the condition: 
 1=mmZY  (17a) 
Invoking the expressions in (16), such a condition yields the dispersion relation: 
 2 and 1  mfor    , 0)1( 22 ==−−− ppm kkjk δ  (17b) 
where we have defined the short-hand notations:

The dispersion relation is a quadratic equation of k, from which two roots are 
expected.  Once the dispersion roots are determined, the wave admittance and wave 
impedance are determined from the equations in (16).  The results are altogether 
summarized in Table 2.  Once the modes are identified and the difference in the 
propagation characteristics is recognized, each of the two mode may be modeled by 
an un-symmetric transmission line as shown in Fig. 3, in which the circuit parameters 
are given in Table 2.

where kx, ky and kz are the three components of the propagation vector, k.  Such a 
dispersion relation represents a spherical surface of the radius km in the 
three-dimensional phase domain, although the medium is bi-isotropic.  In the special 
case of Tellgen medium, we have: ξ = η and δ = 0; the two dispersion relations 
become identical, so that we have a case of double roots 222

physically that a Tellegen medium is totally isotropic.  Furthermore, with ξ = η = 0, 
the dispersion relations reduce correctly to the well known one for a simple medium:

expected, because both TM and TE polarized plane waves with respect to their 
direction of propagation in a simple medium will take the TEM wave as a limiting 
case. 
4.2 Oblique incidence 
The governing equations for the propagation of plane waves under the most 
general conditions are given in (9), which may be analyzed in terms of the eigenvalue 
problem of the coefficient matrix.  Taking the Fourier transform with respect to z, 
e.g., replacing 
dz
d  by -jλ, we obtain a homogeneous systems of linear equations, as 
given by: 
 ( )VSYI c −= 1λ  (19a) 
 ( )ITZV c −= 1λ  (19b) 
where we have defined the short-hand notations: 
 222111 uuZuuZZ c +=  (20a) 
 222111 uuYuuYY c +=  (20b) 
 212211 uuYuuPS +=  (20c)

eigenvectors in (7).  This shows that the power flow is given by the product of the 
modal voltage and the conjugate of the modal current, consistent with the concept of 
the circuit theory.  Furthermore, the total power flowing in the medium is determined 
by the sum of the individual power flow of the two modes.  Thus, the two modes can 
be considered independently in the analysis. 
5. Conclusion 
We have presented a unified approach to the analysis of wave propagation in 
bi-isotropic media.  The concept of perturbation analysis is employed for a easy 
understanding of the physical processes involved, but the mathematical formulation is 
an exact one to establish a solid foundation for the ensuing study in every aspect.  
Through the development of dispersion relation and equivalent network, the results 
are cast in the form that is well known in the microwave community.
