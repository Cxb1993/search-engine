3likely to be formed. On the contrary, if excess aluminum atoms are present, aluminum oxide tend to be
formed. The formation of these compounds influences the optoelectronic properties of CuAlO2
material. Furthermore, as noted, since CuAlO2 material has lower reaction free energy at high
temperature [1], its synthesis requires a higher process temperature as compared with that of CuO,
Al2O3 or CuAl2O4. This study aims at analyzing p-type CuAlO2 film in structural characteristics and
optoelectronic properties.
2. Experimental details
The films were deposited by using a vacuum reactive sputtering system. In this sputtering system,
the angle between the target surface and the substrate surface is about 60°, the atoms are sputtered on
to the substrate surface in an oblique incident angle. The experiment implemented only one target
material for the thin films deposition. The adopted target for sputtering was Cu0.5Al0.5, synthesized by
vacuum melting. For sputtering process, the background vacuum pressure was 6.0 ×10-6 torr, the
working pressure was 2.0 ×10-3 torr, and the sputtering power for the target was 200W DC. During
sputtering deposition, oxygen gas was added for making CuAlO2 films, the ratio of reaction gas
O2/(O2+Ar) was 3/(3+1). The films were deposited at the room temperature. The distance between the
quartz substrate and the target was 90 mm. The time for sputtering deposition was 200 minutes. In
order to develop and investigate the delafossite CuAlO2, after sputtering deposition, annealing was
performed in a furnace under a controlled argon (99.999% purity) atmosphere, where the argon gas
flow was 200 s.c.c.m, and the oxygen partial pressure in the furnace was controlled under 8.0×10-5 atm.
Annealing temperature was raised from room temperature to 800 at the rate of 5 /min, held for℃ ℃ 0.5,
1, 3, 4 and 5 hours in 5 different experiments. The structural and optoelectronic properties of these
films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission transmission electron microscope
(FETEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), spectrophotometer, and the Hall effect measurement.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction spectra of structural variations versus different annealing times.
The spectra reveal that the as-deposited film was amorphous, and after 0.5 hour of annealing at 800°C,
there was multi-phase structure of CuAlO2, CuAl2O4, CuO and Al2O3 formed. With the annealing
process lasting for 4 hours, the diffraction intensities of delafossite CuAlO2 increased, while the
diffraction intensities of Al2O3, CuAl2O4 and CuO decreased correspondingly. After 1 hour of
annealing, Al2O3 vanished. CuAl2O4 as well as CuO phases disappeared at the fourth hour of annealing;
at which point, the film was a single CuAlO2 structure.
From the X-ray diffraction patterns as shown, delafossite CuAlO2 mainly presented peaks at (006),
(101) and (012). Since diffraction peaks (101) and (012) are too close to differentiate their respective
FWHM (full width at half maximum) values as some part of the peaks overlap, the FWHM values of
CuAlO2 (006) peaks were taken for average grain sizes calculation. Fig. 2 shows an enlarged X-ray
diffraction spectra for CuAlO2 (006) peaks. The average grain size was estimated using
5by the annealing treatment. Fig. 4(b) is the selected area diffraction (SAD) of the thin film, whose
diffraction planes are (101), (104), (009) and (110) of the delafossite CuAlO2. Fig. 4(c) illustrates the
interface between the film and the quartz substrate. In this figure, the interface between the amorphous
quartz and the crystalline CuAlO2 is clearly shown; no interface compound was formed as a product of
high-temperature interdiffusion. The XRD diffraction analysis also proved that there was no additional
phase existing in the specimen which underwent 5 hours of annealing. Fig. 4(d) displays the CuAlO2
film’s high-resolution lattice image. Through measurement and calculation, the lattice is of the CuAlO2
plane (006) since the lattice pitch in this figure is determined to be 2.82 Å. The direction perpendicular
to the plane (006) is defined as [006].
Morphology roughness was measured by the atomic force microscope (AFM). Different
annealing holding times led to transfer of phase structures, and brought impact on films morphology.
Fig. 5(a) shows that the as-deposited amorphous film has a minimum root-mean-square (RMS) value
of 0.94 nm. As shown in Fig. 5(a)-5(c), the RMS values increased along with annealing time from 0.94
nm of the amorphous state to 4.45 nm after one hour of annealing. This is due to the transformation
from the initial amorphous state to multi-phase state and changes of crystalline structures. As shown in
Fig. 5(d)-5(f), at the 3rd to the 5th hours of annealing, the RMS values were within the range of
3.78~3.51nm, meaning the phase changes at this stage caused less impact on films morphology. This is
because the films have gradually transformed into single-phase CuAlO2 from the multi-phase
structure.
After the 4 and 5 hours annealing process at 800°C, the films became single-phase CuAlO2; no
multi-phase structure is left. For the single-phase film, the direct band gap can be effectively measured
by means of the plots of(αhν)2 versus hν. The relation equation of optical band gap (Eg) was evaluated
as shown below [17]:
(αhν)1/n =A ( hν－Eg ) (6)
Whereα is the absorption coeficient, hν is the photon energy, A is a constant and Eg is the optical band
gap. The n value for direct allowed transition is 1/2. Table 1 shows the direct band gaps and average
grain sizes of single-phase CuAlO2 after annealing for 4 and 5 hours at 800°C. As revealed in this table,
when the annealing time was 4 hours, the average grain size was 25.8 nm, and the band gap was 3.33
eV. When the annealing time reached 5 hours, the average grain size was 27.5 nm, and the band gap
was 3.26 eV. Increase of the annealing time reduced the band gap of CuAlO2. This could be explained
by a theory that the increased annealing time increases the grain sizes of CuAlO2 and decreases strain
energy of the grains in the film [18]. On the other hand, photoluminescence analysis is a useful tool for
analyzing the band gaps of semiconductor materials. When meeting an exciter of a certain wavelength,
valence electrons of a semiconductor material transit from the valence band (ground state) to the
conduction band (excited state) where the electrons are unstable, and then the electrons transit back to
the ground state from the excited state. Energy of a particular wavelength is emitted during this process,
and by measuring its wavelength we can confirm the band gap of the material. Generally speaking,
since amorphous materials have indirect band gaps, the valence electrons are less likely to transit to the
