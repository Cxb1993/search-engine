Gabor在1946年提出了短時傅利葉
轉換，短時傅利葉轉換的概念主要是將

換，如此便可獲得時間和頻率的關係

4. 實驗及結果分析
為了驗證本方法的可行性，本文實
驗利用一個 1000Hz 的發聲器製造暫態
聲場，並使用 3×4 麥克風陣列進行量
45. 結論
由於本文所採用的近似聲源法理
論，只適用於分析穩態訊號，對於暫態
訊號，則是將短時傅利葉轉換的觀念導
入近似聲源法理論中，使其也能適用於
分析暫態訊號，而非推倒新的暫態近似
聲源法理論，但用於實驗上，證明確實
可以有效的預估聲源開關及移動兩種暫
態聲場，但這兩種聲場的頻率，皆為固
定的 1000Hz，若是在可變的頻率聲場
下，此方法是否適用，仍有代後續的研
究。

Abstract
The paper presents a method of passive
localization for acoustic source in shallow
water based on Ray acoustic theory. Ray
acoustic theory is used to establish
underwater acoustic channel and to analyze
physical quantities (arrival time and arrival
angle ) received by sensors and to determine
mutual relationship of rays between sources
and receivers by using artificial neural
network for source localization . This
Ray-acoustic based method of passive
localization features its simplicity, calculation
efficiency and robust performance to
environment variations. Hence, the method is
more practicable and more valuable for
source localization. In this study, the Ray-
acoustic based method of passive localization
is not only used in shallow water, but it is also
verified by using a non-trained source to
proof its accuracy and reliability.
Key words：Ray acoustic theory, arrival time,
artificial neural network
Introduction
In the present study, a waveguide model
based on acoustic ray theory is used in
shallow water to extract physical quantities
of received rays , and then, sound source
position is evaluated by use of artificial
neural network.
From the late 70's, researchers from various
countries used matched-field processing
technology to do experiments for source
localization and for parameters of marine
environment. Their efforts result in a good
deal of precious, first, firsthand materials.
The depth estimation experiment [ 1 ] done
by Gingras and Gerstoft in 1995 was realized
in nearly ideal condition. In their experiment,
the vertical array was deployed most of water
and the position of hydrophones and
environment parameters were known. Besides,
they used the precise array position to
estimate the environment parameter. Their
method is called " Global forward modeling
parameter estimation" which greatly
enhanced the localization performance.
After the development for nearly twenty years,
matched-field processing technology
surmounted the limit of traditional passive
source localization and provided one way to
explore and understand the marine
environment simultaneously.
Motivation and Objective
Ray theory is used to express propagation of
the path of each ray. In the procedure for the
program in this study, it is assumed that
energy of each ray is greatly reduced due to
the reflections from sea surface and bottom.
In this study, a threshold number of the
reflections of ray is found to set up a upper
limit of reflection for a ray to translate energy
to the receivers. Therefore, the directional
source is assumed by setting the scope of
discharged angle. This will be discussed in
later section
a. Locus of acoustic ray
Considering a ray moves from one point
( , )i ir z to another point( , )r z . there should
be initial angle iand velocity ic ，and
arrival angle and velocity ( )c z at the
next stop. Based on Snel’s Law, it can be 
represented as:

In Ray acoustic theory, supposing that each
part of wave front can be regard as a plane
wave, and the hypothesis is applicative under
the condition of

Therefore, the arrival time that the ray moves

It is assumed that the sound velocity is

linear output layer, can approach to any
rational function. Adding layer number
mainly reduces error further and
increases level of preciseness, but also
makes network more complicated as
well as increases training time. Increase
of preciseness is obtained by increasing
neuron number of hiding layer and its
training effect can be easily observed by
adjusting the layer number. Therefore, it
generally considers increasing neuron
number of hidden layer first.
2. Neuron number of hidden layer:
To increase the level of preciseness of
network training can be achieved easily by
increasing neuron number in a hidden layer.
Then, how many hidden neuron cells should
be chosen? There are two ways to make sure
the number of neuron cells: One is pruning
algorithm developed by Abrahart in 1998.
This method starts the training by setting a
good deal of neuron number of a hidden layer,
then takes out the neuron one by one until a
fitting one is found. However, it’s waste 
plenty of calculating time and is less
economical. Another method constructive
algorithm is developed by Kwok and Yeung
in 1997, which is contrary to pruning
algorithm. The procedures of constructive
algorithm is setting up the numbers of neuron
to start training, then raise the numbers
gradually till mean square error(MSE) comes
to the tolerable range or the minimum of
neuron. When the change of MSE is marginal,
that is the most appropriate number.
3. Speed of learning
The speed of learning determines the changes
of weighting values in every training cycle.
High speed of learning will cause unstable
and slow speed of learning will result in slow
convergence and long training process.
Generally, a lower speed of learning is chosen
to make sure the stability of system. The
range of speed of learning is from 0.01 to 0.8.
The network must be trained by several
different speeds of learning in a neural
network. By observing 2e of each
training, a suitable speed of learning can be
chosen. The speed of learning is suitable if
2e decreases fast, however, if there is
oscillation in 2e , then, the speed of
learning is too high.
Procedures of simulation and results
1.Scope of initial ray acoustic angle
It is time-consuming for the program to
simulate propagation of ray, especially when
it needs to establish huge databases.
Therefore, it needs to find out the smallest
scope of initial acoustic angle to assure that
the program only takes the fewest evaluation
time to obtain physical quantities needed.
Besides the scope of initial acoustic angle, the
number of ray will affect the evaluation time.
Therefore, relationship between initial angle,
reflection times of ray, and travel time are
evaluated to decide the scope of discharged
Input layer: Physical quantities received
by sensors are arrival angle and arrival time.
The positions of sensors are 40m and 80m
below sea surface. The arrival time and
arrival angle from source to two different
positions of sensors are evaluated.
Hidden layer: Neuron numbers are 8, 5, and
8 for each hidden layer respectively. The first
two hidden layers use double tangent S type
transfer function, and the final layer uses
linear transfer function. Levenberg-Marquardt,
which is composed of Step method and
Newton’s method, is used as the rule of
network training.
Output layer: After physical quantities
received by sensors are evaluated or
measured, they are used as input of neural
network, then the position of source which
are the range between sensors and source, and
also the depth of source, are obtained.
Test cases
The source and the sensor is 18537m apart
in range ,and the sensor is 40m in depth. The
acoustic rays that the sensor receives are
analyzed to find the highest pick value of
arrival angle and travel time of rays, then
replace the result as input of artificial neural
network then the output is calculated by the
network. There is 1meter difference of the
inverse calculation in the range distance,
which is an error of 0.0053%. A difference of
2.85 meters of the inverse calculation in the
depth of source that is an error of 2.85%.

of source position 18765m in range and 100m
in depth
Conclusion
This research is to develop a new inversion
procedure for source localization in shallow
water. In this research, the physical quantities
(such as: arrival time and arrival angle) of
acoustic ray are evaluated by ray theory.
And these are cooperated with neural
networks to calculate the acoustic source
position. Main conclusions are generalized as
the followings:
1..The effects of the discharged angle:
In this article, we launches the acoustic ray by
controlling the discharged angle in the scope
of ±11°. From ray number - time distributed
chart , it can prove that the discharged angle
in the scope of ±11° is suitable and feasible.
