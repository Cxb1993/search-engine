limited to, study of biofouling in a running MBR.
III. Experimental (實驗方法)
Sample
Waste activated sludge was obtained from a
wastewater treatment plant owned by Presidential Enterprise
Corp., Taiwan, which treats 250 m3 of food-processing
wastewater daily using primary, secondary and tertiary
treatments. The sludge pH was approximately 6.84. The
chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the sludge and filtrate
passing through 0.45-m membrane was 16,000 mg l-1
(TCOD) and 86.7 mg l-1 (SCOD), respectively, as
determined using a spectrometer (DR/2000, HACH, USA).
The elemental composition of the dried samples, determined
by an elemental analyzer (Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN) was C,
41.3%; H, 6.6%; and, N, 5.4%.
The sludge supernatant obtained after 30 min of
settling was used as the test sample. Flocs were removed to
determine the contribution of the colloidal fractions in the
supernatant to resistance of the fouling layer. Dead-end
membrane filtration tests of obtained supernatant samples
were performed in a 30 cm-Hg vacuum using a 0.45m
mixed cellulose and ester membrane (Advantec MFS, Inc.,
CA, USA). The membrane and fouling layer were carefully
removed from the filtration chamber under fully hydrated
conditions for further processing.
Staining and imaging
Calcofluor white was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
USA). FITC, Con A conjugated with tetramethylrhodamine,
SYTO 63, SYTOX blue and Nile red were from Molecular
Probes (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
During staining, SYTO 63 (20 μM) was initialy
dipped on the sample (10 drops) and placed on a shaker
table for 30 min. Then, 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer
(pH 8.8) was added to the sample to maintain the amine
group in non-protonated form. Then, the FITC solution (10
g l-1) was added to the sample (10 drops) for 1 h at room
temperature. Subsequently, the Con A solution (250 mg l-1,
10 drops) was added to the sample and incubated for another
30 mins. Calcofluor white (fluorescent brightener 28, 300
mg l-1, 10 drops) was then adopted to stain the -linked
D-glucopyranose polysaccharides for 30 mins. In the next
step, the Nile Red solution (10 mg l-1, 10 drops) was applied
to the sample for 10 mins. After each of the aforementioned
five staining stages, the stained sample was washed twice to
remove extra stain using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at
pH 7.4. The stained sample was stored at 4oC. Before
observation, the SYTOX Blue solution was added to the
samples (10 drops) for incubation for 5 mins.
The stained samples were embedded for cryosectioning
and frozen at -20°C, after which 60μm sections were cut on 
a cryomicrotome and mounted on the microscopic slides for
observation.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM; Leica
TCS SP2 Confocal Spectral Microscope Imaging System,
Germany) was employed to probe the internal structure of
fouling layer. The layer was imaged using a 10x or 20x
objective and analyzed using Leika confocal software. The
fluorescence of SYTO 63 was detected by excitation at 633
nm and emission at 650-760 nm (Red). Excitation at 543 nm
and emission at 550-590 nm (light blue) were utilized to
detect Con A conjugates. Nile Red was excited at 514 nm
and emission collected over 630-700 nm (yellow). The FITC
probe was detected by excitation at 488 nm and emission at
500-540 nm (green). The fluorescent intensity of SYTOX
Blue was detected by excitation at 458 nm and emission at
460-500 nm (purple). The fluorescence of calcofluor white
was determined by excitation at 405 nm and the emission
width at 410-480 nm (blue). Both SYTO 63 and FITC were
detected together and the others were detected individually.
IV. Results and Discussion (結果與討論)
CLSM images of fouling layer
Figure 1 presents CLSM images scanned at 5 m
above the membrane surface, representing the deposited
layer on the membrane surface. In this scanned image, all
six probed EPS were distributed in clusters over the fouling
layer. The -D-glucopyranose polysaccharides, lipids and
proteins appeared to correspond closely to the cells
(particularly the dead cells), revealing that these EPS may
be mostly bound EPS to cell membranes. The presence of
-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides however is more
weakly correlated with the cells, as noted for the other
probed EPS, suggesting that it may contribute to the free
EPS that is not tightly bound to the cell membrane.
Figure 2 displays the side-view images of CLSM,
which combine three EPS (Calcofluor white, FITC and
SYTO 63), underneath which is a 35m thick membrane.
This cross-sectional view indicates that the fouling layer has
a thickness of 16–29 m, and a very non-uniform spatial
distribution. The -D-glucopyranose polysaccharides were
distributed over the fouling layer, while live cells were
present as clusters in the layer.
Building fouling layer model
Using a series of CLSM images scanned on the fouling
layer, the three dimensional distributions of nucleic acids
and EPS can be generated by a method presented elsewhere
[33.34]. The CLSM image was bileveled with a threshold
valuedetermined by Otsu’s method. Then, the boundaries in
the bileveled images were classified by connectivity and
whether they were in the object or its complement. The
connectivity of neighboring pixels in all analyses was set to
four to detect the edges. When the boundaries were sketched,
the isosurfaces were developed to determine the object’s 
three-dimensional shape. The advancing-front algorithm is
adopted to fill each region that is defined by the simplified
polygonal surface model of the pores, with unstructured
tetrahedral volumetric grids [35]. Over 106 grid cells were
included in the mesh model to describe the interior of the
fouling layer in Fig. 3 (the central, porous layer). The void
volume divided by the total volume obtained yielded the
mean porosity of the organic fouling layer, which was
estimated at 0.49.
The dark areas in the model represent the pore sites
among the organic molecules, which were probed in the
fouling layer. These can be blocked by other organic
substances or inorganic particles. Accordingly, the flow field
3j satisfies   4/ jjj dnk  . The parameter kj of the pores in
each category can be determined from Fig. 8, and the
number of pores can be estimated from the pore volume and
the pore thickness, based on the assumption that the pores
are cylindrical pipes. Figure 9 shows that the calculated
(kj/nj) value is approximated by a power-law in dj
4.
Therefore, the assumption that the interior pores can be
treated as a bundle of parallel pipes is basically correct.
However, the simulation results that are based on a complex
structure (Fig. 3) reveal a higher permeability than is
predicted by the Hagen-Poiseuille law (Eq. 4), perhaps
because many intersects among various pores facilitate
advection flow when some pores are blocked.
