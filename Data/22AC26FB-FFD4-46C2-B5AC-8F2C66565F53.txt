primary or high schools are children and teenagers. Students in pre- or 
circum-pubescence have a lower metabolism [5], a higher surface area per unit mass 
ratio resulting in losing heat faster [6], and are more sensitive to changes in core 
temperature [7] than adults. The maturation-related differences in thermoregulation 
for children and teenagers from adults make a rational suppose that the requirements 
of primary and high students on thermal comfort may differ from the thermal adaptive 
model in ASHRAE 55. Up to the present, a few studies had concerned with thermal 
comfort of children and teenagers in hot climates, such as Kawano et al [8], Kwok[9], 
and Wong et al[10]. In order to holistic understand thermal adaptive behaviors and 
thermal requirements of children and teenagers, a series of field comfort surveys in 
primary and high schools were conducted, and an adaptive comfort model basing on 
the surveyed data was established. 
The second task concerned with the role of AWSG in improving thermal comfort 
in NV classrooms. In the past decade, considerable researchers studied on the impact 
of building elements on the indoor environment for various types of building in hot 
climates. Radhi et al [11] analyzed the impact of energy regulations in the Gulf States 
on thermal comfort in residential buildings. Singh et al [12] used experimental 
validation and quantitative analysis to evaluate thermal performance and comfort 
temperatures in vernacular buildings of North-East India. Somsak et al [13] conducted 
a study on glass window and glass window with film of different types in aspect of 
thermal comfort and heat transmission in Bangkok, Thailand. In Australia, a study [14] 
was conducted to examine cooling technologies in order to provide comfortable 
internal thermal conditions. Daghigh et al [15] investigated the thermal comfort level 
of an office room through various windows-door opening arrangements in hot and 
humid climate of Malaysia. Zain et al[16] described typical strategies to naturally 
improve comfort in Malaysia without air conditioning. Feriadi and Wong[17] 
explored how to use of natural ventilation strategies in providing thermal comfort in 
hot humid climates. Most of them used building simulation program and conventional 
thermal comfort theories to investigate on how the building envelope should be 
designed to provide thermal comfortable internal conditions. With respect to the use 
of simulation software to assess the thermal comfort of buildings in which a strong 
dependency between weather data and thermal conditions exist, such as residential 
and classroom, Peter’s study [18] emphasized that the conventional algorithms are not 
adequate in such buildings because of the wide range of possibilities to adapt to the 
thermal environment. So an alternative method was used in this study. Long-term 
climatic measurements were carried out in classrooms with different AWSGs. With 
the measurements as inputs, the adaptive comfort model, which is the outcome of the 
first task, was used to act as criteria to ascertain the effects of ASWG on improvement

classrooms have different AWSGs resulting from their different orientations and types 
of external sun-shading system, while they are similar in layout, floor areas as well as 
numbers of pupils. All classrooms for measurement are located in the first floor of 
buildings with two external walls exposed to the outdoor environment and the other 
two internal walls shared with the adjacent classrooms. In addition, they rely on a 
combination of natural cross ventilation through windows on opposing walls and 
mechanical ventilation by ceiling fans to achieve thermal comfort. There are no blinds 
or drapes for the windows. Details of the classrooms’ physical characteristics are given 
in Table 1. The AWSGs in Table 1 were calculated as follows, code [1]:

Since no significant spatial differences in thermal parameters were found, each 
classroom can be qualified by a single value of index, such as operative temperature. 
In the middle of the classroom an indoor climate acquisition system was equipped to 
continuously measure and record the four environmental parameters relating to 
thermal comfort. The measured data were used to calculate the operative temperature 
which is the index in the ASHRAE Standard 55 to describe the acceptable comfort 
range for naturally conditioned spaces. Another set of instruments was placed in 
outdoor space to measure and record the ambient climatic conditions. Measurements 
were taken throughout a whole year, from Feb. 16, 2007 to Feb. 15, 2008. During the

where top is the actual operative temperature in the environment; tlimit is the lower or 
upper temperature limit of the comfort range specified; and tneutral is the neutral

a year, the severity can be evaluated by means of the following expressions, see Eqns. 
(4) and (5). The result is denominate as Iop and Ippd in this study when the weighting 
factor defined in Eqns. (2) and (3) are used, respectively, and expressed in hours.

where t is the time expressed in hour. 
3. Adaptive comfort model for children and teenagers 
One recognized method for predicting the subjective comfort is regression 
analysis [21]. In the regression analysis, a linear best-fit line of mean thermal 
sensation vote (TSV) of subjects was expressed as a function of operative temperature. 
In this study, the thermal sensation votes in classrooms with same rounding value of 
surveyed operative temperature were poured together to calculate the mean value of 
TSV. The mean TSV for each 1°C increment in operative temperature was calculated 
for each month, and these data were regressed to the operative temperature (top). The 
fitted equation is expressed as: 
ܸܶܵ ൌ ܽ ൈ ݐ௢௣ ൅ ܾ (6) 
Table 3 shows the results of regression analyses, and provides information on the 
thermal sensitivity (slope), neutral temperature and the level of statistical significance 
(R2). The R2 values of these regressions suggest a robust relationship between the 
TSV and the top in each monthly survey except in November. The slope of the 
regressed line suggests the thermal sensitivity of the subjects. A smaller value of the 
slope indicates that subjects are able to adapt to the variation in climatic environment 
in this month. It can be seen in Table 3 that the more pleasant weather is and the 
8 
 
recommended temperature in cool months. 
 
 
Figure 1 Relationship between mean monthly outdoor temperature and neutral 
temperature from the comfort survey and ASHRAE Standard 55 
 
The adaptive comfort model in ASHRAE standard 55 specifies a constant width 
of comfort band centralizing on the neutral temperature for 80% and 90% 
acceptability, respectively. It specifies discomfort temperature thresholds for hot or 
cold discomfort in NV buildings, while it does not provide a measure of diagnosing 
the severity of thermal discomfort. Even though the widths of comfort band in 
ASHRAE standard 55 are based on the formula of Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied 
(PPD) which is presented as a function of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Besides it is 
arguable whether the PMV/PPD is suitable for the children and teenagers, the thermal 
conditions in naturally ventilated buildings are often beyond the declared limitations 
for the applicability of the PMV-PPD model [20]. This makes the PMV-PPD mode 
loses the applicability to predict thermal discomfort in the circumstances of NV 
classrooms. In other words, the adaptive model in ASHRAE standard 55 specifies the 
temperature thresholds for NV buildings, while it does not provide a measure of 
diagnosing the severity of thermal discomfort. So, another important thing arose in 
course of the second task is to develop a formula to predict the likelihood that the 
children and teenagers will be uncomfortable in NV classrooms due to hot or cool 
conditions. 
In general, thermal discomfort may arise from departures from the comfort 
temperature, and a bigger difference between actual temperature and comfort 
temperature will cause more discomfort. Nicol et al [22, 23] suggested an approach to 
develop the non-linear likelihood of discomfort. By following such an approach, the 
results are shown in Fig. 2, and explained as follows. The first step is to calculating 
the departure (Δt) from the neutral temperature for each surveyed classroom in every

still express being uncomfortable. Of the 4% who express being uncomfortable, 
three-fourths of them expressed hot discomfort and the rest expressed cold discomfort. 
It is worth to mentioned that the curve of proportion of hot discomfort is 
unsymmetrical around Δt=0 to the curve of cold discomfort. The proportions of hot 
discomfort reach 10% and 20% at Δt=1.7°C and 2.9°C, respectively, while the 
proportions of cold discomfort reach 10% and 20% at Δt=-3.9°C and -5.3°C, 
respectively. The increase of proportion of cold discomfort with respect to departure 
from neutral temperature is almost double to the increase of proportion of cold 
discomfort. From Eqns. (9), (10) and (11) can be defined the Δt limits in accordance 
with the PPD limits for three comfort categories proposed by ISO 7730. The last 
column in Table 2 shows the results of calculated Δt limits for the three categories. 
 
4. Thermal comfort as a function of AWSG 
The outdoor climatic conditions of the investigated year were summarized as 
followed. There are 160 days, on average, when the daily maximum outdoor 
temperature is over 30°C, and 10 days with daily minimum temperature less than 
10°C. The monthly mean outdoor temperature ranges from a minimum of 16.1°C in 
January to a maximum of 28.4°C in August; for 158 days the daily mean temperature 
is over 25°C. The yearly mean relative humidity is 82.8%. 
The measured hourly indoor operative temperatures were used to calculate the 
departures from corresponding monthly neutral temperature determined from Eqn. (7). 
With the calculated hourly departures as input, the hourly PPDs were obtained from 
Eqns. (9)-(11). In Table 3 a statistical summary is given of the PPDs in the classrooms 
with different AWSGs during school time. As might be expected, the measured 
results show the thermal comfort of NV classroom as a function of AWSG. Thermal 
discomfort decreases with lower AWSG. The AWSG improves thermal comfort 
conditions in a classroom by two mechanisms: restraining the classroom orientation 
and attaching external sun shading system to windows. The properties of the two 
mechanisms are represented by the IH and K factor in Eqn. (1). According to the 
statistical results show in Table 3, a generalization can be made that south-north 
orientation and increased sun shading system help to decrease the level of discomfort, 
the south-north orientation more avail than the sun shading system.

lower AWSG frequently has lower operative temperatures when comparing to another 
classroom with higher AWSG. Almost the measured operative temperatures during 
this week in the two classrooms with higher AWSGs show good comfort conditions 
(category A), only the hours in the morning show acceptable thermal conditions 
(category B).On the side, the measurements in the two classrooms with lower AWSGs 
show thermal conditions falling in good or acceptable comfort categories with half of 
them in acceptable category.

When concerning the cold discomfort, during 10% of school hours in cool months the 
indoor operative temperature in the classroom with the highest AWSG stays outside 
the categories “A” and “B”, while in the classroom with the lowest AWSG it is 13%. 
The difference in cold discomfort between the two classrooms is not significantly 
evident. The statistic results in Table 4 illustrate that a very high percentage of school 
hours, 70% and 79% respectively, stay inside the good and acceptable comfort zones. 
In classroom with the highest AWSG, it remains about 20% of school time during 
which indoor operative temperature exceeds the upper limit of acceptable comfort 
condition, while it remain less frequently in classroom with the lowest AWSG. 
However, the maximum upper limit of acceptable comfort conditions during the four 
winter months is 25.9 °C. It is a temperature far less than the upper limit of 
temperature in warm months. In reality, the indoor operative temperatures remain 
under 28 °C rather frequently, and students can alleviate the hot discomfort handily 
through taking off some clothes they had worn, therefore it need not to worry about 
the hot discomfort matter in cool months.

Table 4 shows the frequency of occurrence in the four categories of thermal 
comfort during warm and cool months, respectively, as a function of AWSG, while 
the results in Figs. 7 and 8 illustrate the sensitivity of severity of thermal discomfort to 
the AWSG. The calculation of the long-term indices, Iop and Ippd, defined in Eqns. (4) 
and (5) respectively, has lead to the results reported in Figs. 7 and 8. It is noticeable 
that the two long-term indices show the consistency in comparison of severity of 
discomfort with respect to the AWSG. 
Figure 7 shows that the severity of hot discomfort in warm months increases 
with larger AWSG. Altering the AWSG from 123 to 156 kWh/m2-yr leads to a

AWSG with a purpose of inducing more solar heat gain into classroom seems to be 
not benefit on improving thermal comfort in those coldest days. Practically, no 
suggestion was made in this study on trade-off between hot and cold discomfort 
caused by the energy regulation of AWSG. 
 
 
Figure 8 Long term assessment of discomfort severity in the four monitored 
classrooms during cool months 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper, the effects of energy regulation on thermal comfort in NV 
classrooms in primary and high schools were discussed. The students in primary and 
high school are children and teenagers who have maturation-related differences in 
thermoregulation from adults. For holistic ascertainment of the benefits of energy 
regulation on thermal comfort in NV classrooms, two research tasks were developed. 
The first task is to conduct massive comfort surveys in primary and high schools. And, 
an adaptive comfort model of children and teenagers were established from the data 
gathered in the comfort surveys. The second task is to conduct an environmental 
monitoring in four different classrooms year-round. Their thermal comfort qualities 
were evaluated and compared according to the occurrence and severity of discomfort. 
The following statements about the research project can be made: 
The aim to determine the acceptable indoor thermal conditions for children and 
teenagers in NV buildings and compared them to the recommendatory conditions in 
ASHRAE standard 55 was achieved in the first task of the research project. The 
results of comfort surveys show that children and teenagers have their neutral 
temperatures vary with the mean monthly outdoor temperature in a stronger trend than 
ASHRAE standard 55. A higher neutral temperature for children and teenagers than 
recommendatory temperature by ASHRAE Standard 55 was observed in warm 
months, but the observed neutral temperature approximated to the recommended 
temperature in cool months. The equations, expressed as a function of departure

供全球與會者一個學術交流的平台，也給與科學家、顧問、工程師、建築師、承包商、設施經理、
業主和政策制定者交流科學知識與經驗應用和技術解決方案。來自六大洲五十六個國家共有八百五
十篇的學術文章在這個研討會發表交流。 
    本人於會議期間跟隨黃瑞隆教授、梁漢溪教授身旁，除張貼論文海報外，也於海報張貼的會場
與其他與會學者在會場內參與海報發表內容討論,聆聽與會學者研究成果之發表。 
 
三、與會心得 
 
本次會議期間跟隨於黃瑞隆教授、梁漢溪教授身旁，看著兩位教授與來自韓國、香港及歐、美
的專家學者做學術上的交流討論彼此的看法及經驗的學習。深深感受到雖然國家不同，但對學術研
究的熱忱卻是一樣的。這次參加國際研討會不僅藉此增加國際視野，也對在室內熱舒適方面的研究
有所不同的體悟與心得，同時也在其他的研究領域(音、光、熱、氣、水等)研究都有所窺知，增加
不同角度的思考，激發出更多不同研究方向。
