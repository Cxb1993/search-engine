前言 
As the device scaling continues, the increase of propagation (RC) delay, crosstalk noise and power 
dissipation of the interconnect structure become limiting factors for ultra-large-scale integration of integrated 
circuits. 1 , 2  To minimize the RC delay increase, the industry introduces copper metallization, led by 
International Business Machine Corp. (IBM) in 1997, to reduce the resistance as well as improve 
electromigration performance of the wiring.3 To further reduce the delay, low dielectric constant materials 
(low-k) materials4 such as carbondoped oxide or SiLKTM (k=2.6-3.0)5  are introduced starting 2001 to reduce 
the parasitic capacitance, which is 28-37% reduction from SiO2 (kTEOS=4.2) or 19-28% from fluorosilicate 
glass (kFSG=3.7).6,7 For ultra-low k materials (k<2.5) in 32 nm node and beyond, pores at various porosity 
have been incorporated into the dielectric matrix to reduce k-value. Most of ultra low-k films were prepared 
by introducing templating agent8 into silica structure using spin-on solution coating or plasma-enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition.9 The templating agent or pore generator (porogen) was then removed during the 
deposition or subsequent thermal process. However, due to large pore size/distribution or interconnected pores, 
porous low-k films faced some critical issues such as (1) low mechanical strength leading to delamination or 
cracks after chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) or packaging and (2) poor barrier/dielectric reliability due to 
non-continuous side-wall coverage of barrier. As a result, a late-porogen removal scheme, which uses a 
high-temperature porogen and new integration process to defer the formation of porous dielectric (i.e. the 
removal of high-temperature porogen after a metal/low-k layer is completed), was introduced to circumvent 
these issues.10 
The common method for preparing porous low-k films is to mix porogen into a matrix such as spin-on 
glass in a solution, then spin-coat the matrix/porogen solution onto a substrate. For as-deposited scheme, 
low-temperature porogen will be removed immediately after deposition and cure step. For high-temperature 
porogen in late-porogen removal scheme, a cure step preferably at ≤300 °C is employed to form a crosslinked 
dielectric as the starting interlayer dielectric (ILD). High-temperature porogen is then burned out at 300-400 
°C after CMP step in copper dual damascene process. However, there are serious reliability concerns such as 
interconnected pores and/or poor size distribution11 due to enhanced diffusion and porogen aggregation 
during the cure step.12,13 Such pore morphology leads to weak mechanical strength and insufficient barrier 
coverage at trench side-wall rendering it less suitable for applications in the copper/low-k backend 
interconnect. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of the pore size and especially the 
distribution for ultra low-k materials with high porosity (P > 40-50%). 
 
研究目的 
In order to circumvent the issues of large pore sizes, interconnected pores, and poor distribution in a 
matrix/porogen hybrid system caused by severe aggregation of porogen during the cure process, this proposal 
took a novel approach by grafting a functionalized porogen onto the backbone of low-k precursor, which is 
further crosslinked into a low-k matrix with well dispersed and discrete porogen to achieve excellent control 
of pore size and pore distribution. Therefore, we plan to synthesize the novel porogen with siloxane end-cap 
by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).14 ATRP involves an organic halide undergoing a reversible 
redox process catalyzed by a transition metal compound such as cuprous halide. The reactivity of ATRP 
reactivity is determined by monomer, metal catalyst, organic halides, temperature, and solvents. A number of

polystyrene, and synthesize mesoporous low-k films. We proposed a mesoporous organosilicate by using 
TEPSS and MSQ as reactive porogen and matrix to minimize porogen aggregation at high porosity. The 
TEPSS reactive porogen in this study include some characteristics such as polymer synthesize simply, 
controllable molecular weight (MW), and high reactive with matrix. To identify this novel low-k material, we 
first examined the structures and thermal characteristics of TEPSS reactive porogen and TEPSS-MSQ [i.e. 
triethoxy(polystyrene)silane-g-poly(methyl -silsesquioxane)], respectively. In addition, the morphology, pore 
size, the porosity, and dielectric of porous MSQ low-k film were investigated and discussed. 
 
研究方法 
Materials. -- Styrene (St) (Acros, 99%) was distilled and stored at 5 °C. Copper(I) bromide (CuBr(I)) 
(Sterm Chemicals, 98%) was sublimated before using and stored at 15 °C. Methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) 
(Acros, 97%), N,N,N’,N”,N”-pentamethyl- diethylenetriamine (PMDETA) (Acros, 99+%),  
hexafluorophosphoric acid (HPF6) (Acros, 60 wt%), (3-chloropropyl)(triethoxy)silane (CPTES) (TCI, 95%), 
and sodium laurylsulfate (SDS) (SHOWA, 90+%) were used as-received. Dimethylformamide (DMF) 
(Aldrich, 99%) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Echo, 99%) were distilled to keep them anhydrous before use. 
Toluene (Aldrich, 99.8%) and p-xylene (Aldrich, 99%) were used as-received. 
Synthesis of triethoxy(polystyrene)silane (TEPSS) using ATRP reaction. -- CuBr(I) (2.0 mM) was 
added to a 100 mL two-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a condenser. After sealing, the 
flask was degassed for 2 hours. The initiator, (CPTES, 1.0 mM), solvent (p-xylene, 4 mL), or styrene (50.0 
mM) was degassed individually by three freeze-pump-thaw cycles for each. Subsequently, p-xylene, the 
catalyst (PMDETA, 2.0 mM), CPTES, and styrene were transferred into a flask, which was immediately 
sealed under argon. The mixture in the flask was placed in an oil bath and stirred at 80 °C for 12 hours under 
argon atmosphere. At the end of the polymerization reaction, the flask was quenched in cold water, 
subsequently diluted with THF. Afterwards, Cu2+ was removed through an alumina column. The solvent was 
evaporated under reduced pressure, and the product was TEPSS with a yield of 58.6%. 
Synthesis of poly(methylsilsesquioxane) (MSQ) using sol-gel reaction. -- Methyltrismethoxysilane 
(MTMS, 24.0 mM), distilled water (DI water) (18.0 mM), and hexafluorophosphoric acid solution (HPF6) 
(0.3 mM) were added into an aluminum dish, which was then heated in an oven at 80 °C for 3.5 minutes.  
Grafting TEPPS onto MSQ through sol-gel reaction. -- TEPSS (2.9x10-3 mM) and SDS (3.5x10-3 mM) 
were first dissolved by 6 mL THF in a 100 mL flask. Afterwards, MSQ (1.6 mM) was added into the flask, 
and then 0.06 g of dilute HCl (10%) was added into the flask slowly. The mixture was carried out at 50 °C in 
an oil bath under N2 atmosphere for 6 hours. The sol-gel grafting reaction product was named TEPSS-MSQ. 
The TEPSS loading was varied from 0.6% to 6.6% to increase the loading of high-temperature reactive 
porogen. 
Preparation of porous low-k film. -- TEPSS-MSQ was dissolved in a chosen solvent, THF, to form a 20 
wt% solution. The solution was first filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter (Millipore Inc.), and then spun onto 
a (100) silicon wafer at 2000 rpm for 30 seconds. The TEPSS-MSQ film was subsequently baked at 100 °C 
for 1 minute, and then cured on a hot plate preheated at 250 °C for 30 minutes to form a crosslinked MSQ 
structure. The TEPSS reactive porogens were thermally decomposed at 400 °C for 90 minutes to form a 
porous low-k MSQ films. The nominal thickness of TEPSS-MSQ film cured at 250 °C is 280 nm, unless 
specified otherwise. 
loss is attributed to the decomposition of the PS long-chains in TEPSS. PS long-chains could be removed at T 
> 435 °C under N2 atmosphere in dynamic mode at heating rate of 10 °C/min. Meanwhile, PS long-chains 
also could be completely removed at 400 °C isothermally for 1 hour under a N2 atmosphere. As the result, 
reactive porogen, TEPSS, can be used in conventional back-end fabrication processes and can be burn out 
completely without issue. 
Molecular weight control of TEPSS. -- For low-k dielectric applications, one prefers a low-molecular 
weight TEPSS in order to obtain smaller porogen size in the low-k matrix/porogen mixture, thereby smaller 
pore size in the porous low-k materials after the removal of porogen through thermal decomposition. 
Furthermore, the control of molecular weight distribution is highly desirable to obtain tight pore size 
distribution. We first selected a solvent among toluene, p-xylene, and DMF for achieving TEPSS with a lower 
molecular weight using ATRP method at fixed CPTES initiator concentration (1x10-4 mole) and time (1000 
minutes). Then the dependence of TEPSS molecular weight on the CPTES initiator concentration in the fixed 
solvent was examined.  
The measured molecular weights (Mn and Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI) of TEPSS under various 
synthesis conditions (i.e. CPTES initiator concentration and different solvents) using ATRP method are 
summarized in Table 1. Firstly, it is found that TEPSS had the largest molecular weight (Mn: 81,400 g/mole) 
when DMF solvent was used. TEPSS molecular weight was decreased to 28,000 g/mole when toluene was 
used as the solvent. In contrast, p-xylene solvent yielded TEPSS with the smallest molecular weight (26,100 
g/mole). The difference in the molecular weight of TEPSS by various solvents can be attributed to the 
solubility parameter between the solvent and the CPTES initiator. In specific, the solubility parameters of 
CPTES, DMF, toluene, and p-xylene are 7.44, 10.6, 8.9 and 7.0, respectively.  
For ATRP reaction occurring in solution, the general expression for the rate of polymerization (RM) is 
given by RM = κp[IMy][M], where [IMy] represents the concentration of the growing chains, and [M] is the 
concentration of the monomer.34 The equation illustrated that the concentration of the growing chains can 
affect the reaction rate. The CPTES initiator was dissolved in p-xylene effortlessly due to it have closer 
solubility parameter to p-xylene. Therefore, the reaction solution may have more growing chains and can 
increase the termination rate when p-xylene was used as solvent. The polymer molecular weight can be 
decreased while more growing chains were grew and increasing the termination rate.35 
Table 1 also shows the effect of CPTES initiator concentration on the molecular weight of TEPSS. It was 
found that the molecular weight of TEPSS decreased from 26,100 g/mol to 3,500 g/mol with increasing 
CPTES initiator concentration from 1×10-4 mole to 4×10-4 mole. The relationship between initiator 
concentration and polymer molecular weight in ATRP method can be described by Eq. (2):36  
][

][ln 0 IA
M
M =                                   (2) 
where A=k p K t [Cu+][Cu2+]-1 as a constant, K = ka/kd, ka represented the rate constant for activation, and kd 
was rate constant for deactivation. From the equation, it can be observed that the relationship between 
polymer molecular weight and the initiator concentration was inverse proportion. Due to the numbers of 
radical were increased when the concentration of initiator was increased,37 and the rate of polymerization 
would become faster when there were more radical, and caused smaller polymer molecular weight. 
Overall, we found that both solvent and initiator played critical roles in controlling the molecular weight 
of TEPSS using ATRP technique. Solvent with solubility parameter close to the CPTES initiator increases the 
 7
porosity was controlled by adjusting the weight ratio of TEPSS to MSQ and measured by XRR. In addition, 
the pore sizes were characterized by GISAXS measurement. Table 2 summarizes the density, porosity, 
dielectric constant, and pore size with different TEPSS loading. As TEPSS loading increased from 0.6% to 
6.6%, the porosity of porous MSQ films was increased from 18% to 54% and the density was reduced from 
1.27 g/cm3 to 0.71 g/cm3 after 400 °C curing. After the thermal decomposition of PS long chains at 400 °C, 
the pore morphology of porous low-k MSQ films with various porosities were first examined by SEM and 
shown in Figures 6(a) through 6(d) for 18%, 23%, 31%, and 54% porosity, respectively. Porous MSQ films at 
porosities up to 54% were found to be continuous and smooth with small pores (< 20 nm) in fairly random 
distribution. In addition, the shape of pores is nearly a sphere without obvious aggregation. This indicates that 
the reactive porogen grafting scheme (i.e. TEPSS grafted onto MSQ) can yield smaller pores and uniform 
distribution. 
However, in order to quantify the pore size precisely, GISAXS measurements were further carried out for 
such porous MSQ films. In our case, the 2D scattering patterns were analyzed by a particulate system which 
treats the pores in the matrix the same as the particles in the films. It is known that the intensity of scattering 
pattern (I(q)) is proportional to the product of intra-particle structure factor (P(q), form factor) and inter-particle 
structure factor (S(q), structure factor) as expressed by Eq. (3) 
( ) ( ) ( )qqq SPI ⋅∝                                     (3) 
where q is the scattering wave vector defined by scattering angle (θ) and wavelength of radiation (λ) of x-ray 
by Eq. (4): 
θλ
π sin4 ⋅=q                                     (4) 
The structure factor S(q) is close to one in a low-concentration system or a system without inter-particle 
interactions, and thus can be ignored. Hence, the scattering intensity distribution for a polydisperse system is 
proportional to the ensemble average of the form factor (P(q)) which has been evaluated for a variety of 
particle shapes (spheres, rods, discs etc.). However, in the range of very low q-value (q << 1), P(q) can be 
generalized for a spherical particle system by using the Guinier approximation42,43,44,45 with a radius of 
gyration (Rg), and then Eq.(3) can be further derived as Eq.(5):

I                                   (5) 
Hence, a linear relationship exists between lnI(q) and q2, with a slope of (−Rg2/3), and the steeper the slope, the 
larger the radius. 
Figure 7 shows the Guinier plot (lnI(q ) vs. q2) for porous MSQ films with different porosities, which were 
extracted from MSZ film scattering pattern and approximated by Guinier theory for quantitative analysis. The 
similar slopes indicate that the Rg size was maintained with the porosity increasing from 18% to 31%. The 
slope changed varied little when the porosity was up to 54%. Since the shape of pore is close to a sphere as 
confirmed by SEM, the pore diameter (d) could be deduced from d = 2×(5/3)1/2×Rg.46,47 As a result, the pore 
size maintained 18 nm with porosity increasing from 18% to 31%, but showed little variation that pore size 
was increased to 19 nm at 54% porosity. Consequently, grafting reactive porogen onto low-k matrix can cause 
small pore and has less pore aggregation below a critical porosity, i.e. ~31% porosity for TEPSS-MSQ system.
