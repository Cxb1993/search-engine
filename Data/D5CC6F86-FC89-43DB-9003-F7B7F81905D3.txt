二、英文摘要 
 
 In this project, tasks on (1) perception with radio frequency identification (RFID) and (2) control with 
imitation learning are accomplished and verified. While collision-free navigation could be done using 
traditional rule-based approaches, it becomes more attractive to use learning from demonstration (LfD) 
approaches to ease the burden of tedious coding and parameter tuning procedures recently. Given the world 
model, the starting pose, and the goal pose, a path could be learned using trajectory-based LfD approaches. In 
this project, we argue that learning collision-free navigation in static environments could be accomplished 
using only instance-based examples without using global information such as the map and the goal location. 
Meanwhile, on the perception side, the RFID technology has been studied and used to solve the localization 
and mapping problems in which most of studies use long-range active or passive RFID systems with multiple 
readers and dense tags. In this project, we propose to use a short-range passive RFID reader to accomplish 
extended Kalman filter (EKF) based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with sparse tags in large 
indoor environments. We demonstrate that it is feasible to accomplish SLAM with sufficient accuracy using 
only odometry and short-range RFID data. The experimental results of control with imitation learning using a 
real robot with a laser scanner demonstrated that the low level control commands for collision-free navigation 
are learnable from demonstration using the proposed approach, while the simulation and experimental results 
of RFID SLAM demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.

compared with indoor or outdoor environments thus the effect of the environment to the robot is not 
considered in this application. In most applications, the information from the environments is usually 
extracted to form the feature space. The transformation from a feature space to a cost space could later be 
learned for outdoor navigation using trajectory-based examples generated by a planner [12]. In [15] and [16], 
it is assumed that an optimal or near-optimal action agent could be queried during the learning process and an 
agent could be trained to navigate through the environments in the world of Super Tux Kart or Super Mario 
Bros. 
 Observing such successes, demonstration based learning techniques may be a great tool to learn the 
actions of the robot according to the user’s demonstration. Thus, we aimed to use demonstration based 
learning techniques to deal with the motion control problems in this project. On the other hand, for a mobile 
robot, it is also important for the robot to have the ability to localize itself and generate the map thus the 
global path planning could be done accordingly. In this project, the radio frequency identification (RFID) 
technology has been applied to solve the localization and mapping problems. The radio frequency 
identification technology has been applied in many applications such as storage management, personal 
guarding and public transporting system. The RFID applications are flexible and feasible because of RFID’s 
fast detection capability and contactless identification with perfect data association. As data association is one 
of the most challenging problems in robot perception, the RFID technology has been used to solve a number 
of daunting robot perception problems such as mapping, localization and activity recognition. With a 
predefined or calibrated map of RFID tags, localization can be performed [17] [18] [19]. Hähnel et al. [20] 
and Joho et al. [21] proposed to learn the map of the RFID tags with perfect localization, and then use the 
built map to perform localization in which mapping and localization are solved separately in the two stages. 
RFID is also used and integrated with other sensors. In [22], data from a camera and RFID mounted on a 
pan-tilt unit of a robot are fused to accomplish person tracking where a RFID tagged person can be followed 
by the robot. As RFID tags also have a limited data storage capability, RFID can be used to deliver 
information in tasks such as activity recognition [23], search and rescue [24], and human robot interaction 
[25].

effect, the delayed-state EKF [26] is implemented to deal with the issue of delayed measurements.

project. Table I summaries a comparison of the proposed method and related works and demonstrates the 
significance of the proposed approach in terms of the cost, the accomplished tasks and the coverage area per 
tag. 
RFID measurement modeling strongly depends on the communication between the tag and the antenna 
(or reader) which is affected by a number of the environmental and location-dependent factors such as 
materials the tag and the reader are attached to, orientations between a tag and the antenna, objects disturbing 
the electromagnetic wave and interferences from the scene. There are two major measurement modeling 
approaches. One is the environment-based measurement model and the other is the sensor-centric 
measurement model. 
In the environment-based modeling approach, data are collected at each place in the environment as 
snapshots or fingerprints [27] [28]. These snapshots or fingerprints are later used for accomplished 
localization. In [29], the robot trajectory is estimated in a batch-processing fashion which could be unsuitable 
for real-time and online robotic applications. In this work, the proposed approach is online in a 
recursive-processing fashion. 
The sensor-centric measurement modeling approach was firstly proposed in [20]. Vorst et al. [30] 
proposed a semi-supervised learning approach to learn about the detection probability. With a high-end 
long-range RFID system, Ni et al. [17] adjusted the power levels of the antenna to change detection ranges for 
estimating distances between the reader and tags. In the RFID systems that the received signal strength 
indication (RSSI) is available, the signal strength can be used for estimating distances between the reader and 
tags [31]. Joho et al. [21] took both RSSI and the detection probability into account using a hybrid 
measurement model. In the applications that the high-end RFID systems are used, measurements from RFID 
could contain range information. Bearing information could be also available if multiple readers are used. In 
this work, the low-cost RFID system is applied in which both range and bearing information are unavailable. 
Delayed state estimation is well understood in the control literature. The Delayed-State EKF was 
proposed to estimate the states of nonlinear time-delay systems in [26]. In the robotics literature, Eustice et al. 
[32] used the exactly sparse delayed-state filter to initiate the new landmarks. With the augmented poses, 
landmarks can be estimated more accurately. In this work, we follow the same principle to deal with the 
delayed measurement problem of our short-range passive RFID system and accomplish SLAM.

（四）、研究方法 
 The methods and algorithms of both learning from demonstration and RFID-SLAM are described in this 
section. 
 
A. Learning from demonstration 
The learning from demonstration framework can be modeled as finding optimization criteria that make 
the expert look optimal in the sense that the learning procedure is used to identify a mapping from features of 
a state to costs such that the resulting minimum cost plans capture well the demonstrated behavior [12] [35]. 
This intuition is formalized by the maximum margin planning (MMP) framework [34] which could be solved 
by the Learning to Search (LEARCH) algorithm [35]. In this project, the learning algorithm is implemented 
based on the LEARCH algorithm with some minor changes based on the application. 
 
(a). The Learning to Search (LEARCH) Algorithm 
Recall that the goal is to identify a mapping function from features of any given state to costs such that 
the resulting minimum cost plans capture well the demonstrated behavior. To get a minimum cost path, it is 
essential to get the cost value on each state in the map as 𝑠(𝐹𝑖) which could be generated by querying the 
feature function F to get the features in a given state 𝑖 and applied it with the learned costmap s. The costmap 
is then further modified to the exponential form as 𝑒𝑠(𝐹𝑖) to create a hypothesis space of cost functions with 
substantially higher dynamic ranges for a given set of features and fulfill the requirement of many planning 
algorithms with strictly positive costs in order to ensure the existence of an admissible heuristic. 
The procedure of the LEARCH algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1. The log-costmap is initialized as 
zero. Then the loss function and feature function are used to compute the loss-augmented costmap. Here the 
loss function is used to perform margin-maximization like the similar interpretation in support vector machine 
[35] and could be easily defined by the users. The feature function is used to provide the observed features at 
a given state. A planner in the learner then plans a path using the loss-augmented costmap. According to the 
current planned and example paths, the learner generates positive and negative examples and then further 
trains a regressor or classifier based on those collected data set to get the log-hypothesis in order to update the 
costmap during the training process. The training process is terminated if the planned paths are close enough 
with the example paths.

initial position of the robot is given. Those information of the motion is decomposed motion to three 
components: a rotation, followed by a straight line translation, and another rotation which is formulated as [d 
r1 r2], where d is the translation, r1 is the initsial rotation, and r2 is the final rotation. The robot pose 
transformation is simplified from [37]: 
 
   (       ) = (
    +     (   1 +  1)
    +     (   1 +  1)
   1 +  1 +  2
)                   (1) 
 
where the xt-1 =[xt-1 yt-1  t-1]
T
 is the robot pose in the previous time step. The variance of the three components 
is estimated using the following equations: 
 
  
2 = {
   m n
2                        m n
(   )2                                
                   (  )
  
2 = {
   m n
2                  ( 1 +  2)      m n
(   )2                                               
    (  )
 
 
where   and   are the percentage of the distance and rotation difference.  d,min,  r,min are the minimum 
standard deviation of distance and rotation respectively. 
 
(b). Probabilistic Measurement Model for Short-Range RFID 
The probabilistic measurement model is established as P(zt∣xt, li) ≈ P(zt∣△(xt, li) ) where △(xt, li) is 
the relative location between the i-th tag and the RFID antenna, zt is the measurement from the reader, xt = (x, 
y,  ) is the antenna pose, and li = (li,x, li,y) is the i-th tag location. Without RSSI and power levels data, our 
RFID system only receives strings of the tag ID code. Fig. 2 (a) shows the histogram of the tag detection 
events in a 2D space of the RFID system. The size of each grid is 2cm_2cm. The measurements of the tag 
detection events in each grid are collected from the center of the antenna to unobservable areas. It is clear that 
the reliable detection range of the system is less than 10cm. The relative orientation between the tag and the 
antenna may affect the speed of the system charging, but in our system the effect is negligible with the 
maximum 24-millisecond operating time. 
From Fig. 2 (a), the weighted mean and variance with respect to the antenna coordinate system are 
computed from the histogram by taking the detection probability in each grid as the weight. Fig. 2 (b) shows 
the proposed probabilistic measurement model of tag detection with the weighted mean and variance. Hence, 
the measurement model is formulated as 
 
P(z |  (     )) =  P(ID|  (     ))  ≈  P (z  l|  (     ))    (3) 
 
where ID is the unique ID code and zt,l is the relative tag location in the antenna coordinate system.

Fig. 5. One of the demonstrations in the navigation environment as depicted in Fig. 4. The ambiguous 
regions within the green rectangles would cause the poor performance when testing. 
 
Fig. 5 shows one of the demonstrations in the environment. The local map and the robot pose are 
generated by the iterative closest point (ICP) [40] alignment with the initial guess from the information of the 
recorded odometer data. In this case, the learned policy results in hitting the obstacles or the walls. It is 
because the ambiguity of the environment to cause such results. To make an explanation, check out the 
rectangle regions depicted in Fig. 5 and the laser scans in those regions in Fig. 6 to understand the ambiguity 
issue. When testing, the learned policy may drive the robot to pass through the right passage at the bottom 
rectangle region or drive the robot to pass through the center passage at the top rectangle region. It is a 
reasonable control policy given the demonstrations and the laser scans. However, as the robot dimension is 
not included in the learned policy, the robot would be encouraged to pass through a narrow passage by the 
learned policy and results in hitting the obstacles or walls as illustrated by Fig. 7. 
In our second attempt, the environment is slightly modified to reduce some narrow passages thus also 
reduce the ambiguity when testing. Fig. 8 (b) shows one of the three demonstrations in the less ambiguous

performance of the proposed approach should strongly depend on the odometry data quality. The motion error 
in terms of the velocity is 10 cm/sec and the angular error is 0.05 rad/sec. The simulated motion control 
command is the motion model uncertainty multiplied by the given noise level number. This simulation 
performs 10 loops for each run and applies Monte Carlo test with 10 runs for each noise level number. 錯誤! 
找不到參照來源。 shows the root mean square errors from the 0.6 noise level to 1.6 noise level in which 13 
tags are deployed at fixed locations. The maximum and minimum curves show the mean values of the 
maximum and minimum range errors for each tag in the 10 runs, respectively. In 錯誤! 找不到參照來源。, 
the results of the 5th loop and the 10th loop are also illustrated. The result indicates that the mapping error 
increases as the odometry noise level increases. At the 0.8 noise level, the mapping error is 2m with the 
minimum error 1.05m and the maximum error 3.23m. It is also demonstrated that the mapping error becomes 
smaller with more loops as the relationship between the robot and tags could be more certain with more 
information. 
The second simulation evaluates the effect of the number of tags. In each run, the simulation selects a fix 
number of tags from 4 to 40. The tags are deployed randomly. The robot performs a 10-loop trajectory. For 
each number of tags, 10 Monte Carlo tests are performed. The odometry noise level is 0.6, and the velocity 
noise is 6 cm/sec and the angular velocity noise 0.03 rad/sec. 錯誤! 找不到參照來源。 shows the results in 
which the mapping error is decreasing and converged to 0.6m as the feature number increases. As the 
30m×20m environment should be large in many indoor robotics applications, the SLAM performance is 
acceptable. The results also point out that more tags do not always improve the performance. 
In addition to performance evaluation in the previous figures, Fig. 12 shows the SLAM results of the 5th 
loop at the 0.6 noise level and at 1.4 noise level with 13 tags and 40 tags. It shows that the effect of the 
odometry noise level could be significant and the topology of the map could be more accurate with sufficient 
tags. 
 
(b). Experiments using NTU-PAL4 
The experiment using the NTU-PAL4 robot with the short-range passive RFID system was conducted in 
the 4th floor of our department building. The environment size is about 20m×50m and the 66 passive RFID 
tags were randomly attached on the wall. The NTU-PAL4 robot was controlled manually to follow the wall 
for detecting the tags and followed the same loop 5 times. To evaluate the effect of the number of tags, the 
tags are randomly chosen with a fix number from 10 to 66. We perform 10 Monte Carlo tests for each number 
of tags. Fig. 13 shows the root mean square errors of the mapping errors. The errors decrease when the 
number of tags increases. According to the analysis, only 25 tags are needed to accomplish SLAM in the 4th 
floor of our department building and the mapping error is converged to 2.43m. 
Fig. 14 show the results of mapping and localization with 25 and 66 tags. The mean of the mapping error 
with 25 tags as shown in Fig. 14 (a) is 2.43m with the minimum error 0.28m and the maximum error 4.31m 
comparing to the ground truth obtained from the SICK laser scanner. The mean of the mapping error with 66 
tags as shown in Fig. 14 (b) is 1.44m with the minimum error 0.16m and the maximum error 4.25m. Note that 
there is a large gap between two tags at the bottom of the map and the tag location uncertainties are large in 
this area. However, the topological geometry of the built map is still close to the ground truth. Although the 
accuracy of mapping and localization of the proposed approach may not be superior to the systems using 
long-range active RFID readers with dense tags, the performance of the proposed approach should be

The future works of this project are also addressed in two parts. The first part is the navigation 
learning based on the learning from demonstration framework. The second part is the environment 
learning. 
Recent years, safe navigation of a mobile robot through crowds of dynamic agents was studied 
[41] [42]. Using the simulation, they show that it could be possible to teach the robot to navigate 
through dynamic environments. It is our future work to do the navigation in dynamic environments 
with the real robot using the framework of learning from demonstration. How to extract the 
information from the dynamic environments is the key issue. The temporal information such as 
tracking results should be very important. A local map contains temporal information should be built 
from the demonstrations for the learning process. The failure cases could also be additional 
examples for the training process without repeatedly querying the user. Although the issue of feature 
extraction is not addressed in this work, the feature selection is still an important issue for the 
learning process. It is an important future work to find out a suitable data representation to ease the 
burden of feature selection. For the environment learning issue, thus far, the robot is manually 
controlled to detect tags. We would like to develop an automatic tag search engine in which 
different strategies will be defined to search new and existing tags based on the SLAM estimates.
