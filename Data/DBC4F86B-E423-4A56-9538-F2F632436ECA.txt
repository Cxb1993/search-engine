of detecting and mitigating various forms of interference.
Individual techniques for the mitigation of interference are
incapable of nullifying the inﬂuence of diverse, concurrent
sources of interference. Therefore this paper proposes a
mechanism capable of adaptive signal detection, switching,
selection and interference suppression to deal with multiple
forms of interference, increase the anti-J robustness of
receivers and improve ﬂexibility in the selection of signal
reception paths.
The objective of this paper was to integrate various
interference mitigation techniques to achieve maximum
anti-J performance in the simplest possible manner. This
paper proposes a multiplexing scheme to detect, identify,
eliminate or mitigate spooﬁng/co-channel interference and
CWI to reduce the susceptibility of the receiver to being
misled or corrupted.
First, a signal detector identiﬁes the form of the interference,
whereupon a corresponding anti-J module mitigates or
nulliﬁes the interference. Different forms of interference
require different mitigation modules, the selection of which
depends on a lookup table. This approach resembles that of
on-demand routing protocols in ad hoc networks. In the
event that a source is unable to identify a path to an intended
destination, a path discovery request is submitted and
the information is transmitted once the path has been
discovered. The proposed detector is capable of accurately
identifying and cancelling out spooﬁng signals. The
proposed countermeasures are based on satellite orbit
information derived from the GPS YUMA almanac.
The YUMA almanac is an American standard code
for information interchange (ASCII) message carrying
information in the YUMA format [4], comprising a pseudo
random noise (PRN) number, satellite health, eccentricity,
time applicability, orbital inclination, right ascension at
time of almanac and GPS week. The information can be
downloaded from the website for the United States Coast
Guard Navigation Center. The combination of almanac
information and GPS time enables calculation of the
corresponding location and speed of the satellite in relation
to each observation. In this manner, the receiver remains
informed of which satellites to expect, their position and
Doppler frequency, which enables the device to effectively
nullify the effect of such attacks and safeguard against
erroneous positioning.
The inclusion of anti-J processing during signal acquisition
provides a second layer of protection against interference,
and also reduces the overall computational load and
complexity of the required hardware. In simulations, the
effective carrier-to-noise ratio was used to assess the
performance of the proposed scheme, the results of which
demonstrate that the multiplexing technique is capable of
accurately identifying and selecting appropriate modules to
mitigate attempts at jamming and ensure the positioning
performance of the GNSS receiver.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows:
Section 2 depicts the objectives of this paper. Section 3
illustrates the proposed multiplexing scheme. In Section 4,
two simulated scenarios are conducted to evaluate the
performance of the proposed strategy. Section 5 provides a
summary and describes future avenues of research.
2 Problem statement
This section describes anti-J techniques and their limitations
in performance, focusing on how the simultaneous
occurrence of various forms of interference inﬂuences the
positioning performance of receivers. Methods for
improvement are also provided.
2.1 Anti-jam architecture overview
A variety of techniques have been developed to mitigate GPS
interference, including adaptive antenna arrays, antenna
switching and techniques involving the internal design of
receivers, such as notch ﬁlters, transversal ﬁlters, spectral
ﬁlter and aided tracking loops. Each technique has its pros
and cons. Adaptive array provides interference mitigation
capability in the range of 30–50 dB; however, they are
bulky and costly. Switching antennas or combining
networks to control antenna coverage involves the use of
individual apertures that are difﬁcult to install. Techniques
based on the internal design of the receiver are well suited
in dealing with various types of band-limited interference;
however, they are typically limited to counteracting in-band
interference. To meet the future demands of GPS, anti-J
designs must take into account the following considerations:
1. the ability to use inexpensive antenna array systems;
2. heightened interference detection and anti-J techniques
capable of combatting all forms of interference;
3. enhanced tolerance of receivers towards interference;
4. the ability to integrate anti-J procedures with current
receivers.
The factors commonly exploited for the suppression of
interference and anti-J are adaptive antenna array [5],
frequency and time-domain ﬁltering [6–8], spatial–
temporal domain ﬁltering [9], pattern discipline, and the
coupling and aiding of the inertial system. Adaptive
antenna array techniques typically comprise null steering
and beam steering algorithms. Null steering is a robust
technique because of its directional stability, and has been
widely used in military systems such as controlled radiation
pattern antenna [10]. The nulling steering technique is
capable of dealing with multiple sources of wideband
noise and narrowband interference, providing 25–30 dB of
suppression for each source of interference, up to a set
number of individual sources that it is capable of dealing
with (typically the number of array elements minus one).
Beam steering typically adopts adaptive planar arrays to
provide beam control/discipline with varying degrees of
GPS satellite selectivity and resistance to interference [11].
High gain and side-lobe/back-lobe rejection levels are
used to enhance anti-J capability. The key to this technique
lies in the synchronisation of the clock at each front-end
module with the processing of the internal receiver.
Frequency-domain ﬁltering is used for spectral ﬁltering,
involving bandpass and band-reject ﬁltering. The technique
can be applied to bounded narrow-band, in-band sources
of CWI and strong out-of-band sources of interference.
Typically, implementation involves processing digital
signals to develop a stand-alone module to be embedded
into the GPS receiver. Filtering techniques are capable
of mitigating narrow-band interference by more than
35 dB and dealing with multiple sources of narrow-band
interference at low cost, with only a small impact on size
[6]. Temporal or time-domain ﬁltering adopts digital signal
processing methods to implement programmable inﬁnite
impulse response/ﬁnite impulse response ﬁlters and multi-
correlators. It can also be used for multipath cancelling
problems [12]. The time-domain technique is effective
for bounded interference sources because of its ability to

0 Mode 2 Mode 3 Mode 1 Mode 0. The system
operates in one mode at any given time.
The following provides a mathematical description of
the received signal as a foundation for subsequent discussion.
3.1 Spatial array model
The received array signal can be modelled as
r[k] = a0s0[k]+
∑L
l=1
a˜l s˜l[k]+
∑J
i=1
biui[k]+ h[k] (1)
The input array signal with N antenna has already been down-
converted and digitised by the front-end of the receiver in (1).
r[k] = [ r1 r2 · · · rn · · · rN ]H is an N × 1 vector of
the input signal. The notation r [k] ¼ r (kTs) is used to
denote a digital sequence sampled at the frequency fs ¼ 1/
Ts. Ts is the period of sampling. k is the discrete time index.
a0, a˜l and bj are the N × 1 steering vectors of the desired
satellite signal s0, the lth co-channel satellite signal s˜l and
the ith continuous-wave interference ui, respectively. The
steering vector represents the relative phases at each
antenna corresponding to the azimuth u and elevation w,
where the steering vector varies according to the
conﬁguration of the array [18]. L and J represent the
number of visual satellites and CWI, in which the spooﬁng
signal is included within L satellites. h[k] is the noise
vector having zero mean and a Gaussian distribution. It is
assumed that the GPS signal, interference and noise are
uncorrelated. Thus, the desired signal component can be
modelled as
s0[k]=
NameMeNameMeNameMe
C0
√
g0(kTs− t0)b0(kTs− t0)cos(2p(fIF+ f0)kTs+f0)
(2)
where C0 is the power of the received signal. g0 and b0 are
the spread code and navigation message with time delay t0,
respectively. The carrier component comprises one
digitalised intermediate frequency (IF) fIF. The Doppler
frequency f0 is introduced by the communication channel
and phase shift f0. In (2), fIF and f0 are expressed in units
of Hz. In addition, the in-band interference ui in (1) is
deﬁned as
ui[k]=
NameMeNameMeNameMe
Pi
√
exp{−j2pfikTs+ ui} (3)
where fi and ui are the digitalised carrier frequency and
phase, respectively. The signal structure of the spooﬁng
signal and the GPS discussed here is the same and is
classiﬁed in co-channel navigation signals. The incoming
signal model described in (1) is processed in its
corresponding module according to the decision mode. The
following demonstrates the signal processing method of
each module: signal detector, anti-J module and decision
logic module.
3.2 Signal detector
3.2.1 GNSS signal detection: The signal detection
process involves a two-dimensional search, with the aim
of acquiring the coarse code phase and Doppler frequency.
It generates an initial signal parameter for subsequent
signal tracking. Typical acquisition methods include a
sequence search method and block FFT search method.
For the common signal processing method, the process
is terminated once the coarse signal parameter is acquired.
However, a search of the entire area is required to
determine whether a spooﬁng signal is present.
In the process of signal acquisition, the ﬁrst step is to set
the PRN number of the desired satellite. The digitalised
incoming signal is then processed through an FFT-based
search method [19]. The correlator output z is compared
with a threshold corresponding to the probability of
detection PD and the probability of false alarm PFA. Given
PFA, the detection threshold g can easily be determined by
inverting the function PFA(g)
PD(g) = rHd (z(w, v) ≥ g) (4)
PFA(g) = rH0 (z(w, v) . g) (5)
where g is the detection threshold and r(.) is the probability
function. Hd and H0 represent whether the desired signal is
present/absent and whether it is correctly aligned with the
local replica. w and v depict the code and Doppler trial
point on a two-dimensional grid. When w and v are equal
to the actual code phase and Doppler frequency, z yields

where the symbol ‘’ represents the estimated value. g(.) has
the same depiction as in (1), which is also written as
g(kTs) =
∑1
b=−1
Fb exp{j2pbkTs/Tc} (13)
Fb is the Fourier series coefﬁcient of the periodic function
g(.). Substituting (13) into (12), provides

In (14), assume that the interference frequency
fi = f˜ IF + f˜ d + Dfi is a kHz away from the sum of IF, the
Doppler frequency and a residual term Dfi. After
integration, (14) is as follows
F =

By deﬁnition, the residual term Dfi is lower than 1/2Tc; then
for a= −b, sinc{((a+ b/Tc)+ Dfi)KTs}  0. Otherwise,
sinc{((a+ b/Tc)+ Dfi)KTs} ; sinc{DfiKTs}. Therefore (15) is
rewritten as
F = TcCaF∗a sinc(DfiTc) exp −j2p

where ‘∗’ is a conjugate operator. Tc is the integration time

interference. After non-coherent integration time M, (9) is
re-written as

3.2.3 Spoofing signal detection: This section describes
how the existence of a spooﬁng signal is validated. SPS
detection is based on whether two correlation peaks appear
in the signal acquisition dimension. Such an appearance
indicates two satellites with the same PRN number, which
reveals the appearance of a spoofer. Typically, spoofers can
alter the time offset and navigation data, because the
position of the user and information related to the satellite
in the sky are known to the spoofer. If the power of a
spoofer is not sufﬁciently strong to invalidate the
positioning of the receiver, the user can be informed of the
available satellite through YUMA data. If the PRN number
of a counterfeit satellite matches that of the available
satellite at that time, signal acquisition is utilised to evaluate
Fig. 2 Signal acquisition procedure using CWI detector/excisor

The only difference is that in (17) the interference bandwidth
is supposed to be much smaller than the reciprocal of
the integration period of the tracking loop. Unlike in [23,
24], the inﬂuence of Doppler frequency and integration
duration is taken into account in (17). This estimation of
effective C/N0 is important because it helps to verify whether
the carrier and code tracking loops are in lock, to control
the response of the receiver to low signal in a noisy
environment, and to determine the signal-to-noise ratio to
assess or predict receiver performance. This well-known
method is called the narrow-to-wideband power ratio method
[17, 25]. The measured carrier power-to-noise density can
be obtained as a function of the power ratio measurement,
as follows
C

(26)
where <W and <N are calculated as follows

<N =

m=1
I2m +
∑M
m=1
Q2m (28)
where Im and Qm denote the observable in-phase and
quadrature components of the prompt, evaluated M times in
interval Tc. Note that the difference between (25) and (26) is
that (26) is used to estimate the C/N0 of experiment data
whereas (25) is the theoretically calculated C/N0.
Equation (26) is the criterion required to evaluate the
performance of the anti-CWI and anti-SPS module. In
the following, the operation process of decision logic is
demonstrated.
3.3 Decision logic module
This section demonstrates how to select the signal processing
mode with regard to signal detection results under various
environments. If the spooﬁng signal has been detected and
cancelled, SPSFLAG ¼ 0. The ﬂag OUTFLAG determines the
mode selection results shown in Table 1. ‘Hold mode’
indicates that the previous state is maintained. After
conﬁrmation that both CWIFLAG and SPSFLAG are equal to
one, mode 2 (anti-CWI) is performed.
After switching CWIFLAG to zero, mode 3 (anti-SPS
module) is initiated, whereas mode 2 stays the same. In
addition, the ﬂag STATEFLAG ¼ 1 indicates the environment
is jammed, otherwise, it is considered as an unjammed
environment. In CWIFLAG ¼ 0 and SPSFLAG ¼ 0, the output
OUTFLAG maintains the previous mode until the spooﬁng
signal and CWI are mitigated and the decision logic module
switches to the initial mode (mode 1).
3.4 Anti-J module
This section describes the methods involved in mitigating or
eliminating interference. The anti-J module is performed
when the decision logic module is switched to anti-CWI or
anti-SPS mode. The procedure of anti-CWI mode is
demonstrated in the following.
3.4.1 Anti-CWI mode: The anti-CWI module is performed
while the decision logic module is set to mode 2. The function
of this module is to demodulate the carrier component and
then transform it into the frequency domain using the FFT
operator. Finally, an excision method is utilised to remove
the partial interference component. Each frequency cell is
compared with the threshold, which if exceeded, is held at
the threshold, as follows [6] (see (29))
where kavg and kvar are the average and variance of a set of
frequency components. Y [k] is the result for correlation
output y from the FFT operator. K has the same deﬁnition
as (7). The scale factor a in the above equation is adjusted
to maintain the threshold of the noise ﬂoor at a given value.
K2 1 is the number of frequency components. By
removing these peaks, the output is then correlated with the
local replica.
3.4.2 Anti-SPS mode: The key objective of this section
is to illustrate how to ameliorate the impact of a spooﬁng
signal on the performance of GNSS receivers. In a real
environment, the direction of the spoofer is unknown. Thus,
it is important to strengthen the directional gain of authentic
satellites and to promote the effective C/N0 through mode 3
(anti-SPS mode) to prevent the reception of signals from
counterfeit satellites. This module adopts a block adaptive
spatial beamformer (BASB) algorithm to adjust the antenna
weight and enhance the directional gain of the desired
satellite [26]. The measurement data are multiplied by the
adaptive weights and summed up to provide the output for
acquisition/tracking applications. This method is executed

opposed to only spooﬁng signal before and after the
processing of anti-SPS. The ﬁgure shows that the signal
detection probability curve decreased when the C/N0 was
above 36 dB Hz without co-channel interference and
38 dB Hz with co-channel interference, respectively. Note
that the brown curves demonstrate slightly better
performance at low C/N0 with a signiﬁcant degradation at
high C/N0. This is because at high C/N0 the spooﬁng signal
is more likely to be detected and regarded as the desired
autocorrelation peak. Overall, in the event of co-channel
interference, the strength of the GPS signal reception must
be increased to maintain a detection probability equal to
what is achieved in the absence of interference. The greater
the strength of the spooﬁng signal, the lower the expected
probability of signal detection and the higher the frequency
of false alarms.
Through the processing of the anti-SPS module, the
detection probability was increased to 0.78 and 0.83 when
the effective C/N0 was 36 dB Hz without co-channel
interference and 38 dB Hz with co-channel interference,
respectively. Fig. 5a also shows that when the SPS was
effectively mitigated, the probability of signal detection
could be enhanced mainly at a high C/N0. Fig. 5b depicts
the false alarm rate as a function of C/N0. The ﬁgures show
that in circumstances of co-channel interference, the GPS
signal reception must also be strengthened to maintain the
same false alarm rate as in circumstances without interference.
Another case assumes that the CWI presented in the
system and the magnitude of co-channel interference
as {SLl=1ClR

l0(t)}/LN0 = 20 dBHz have been considered.

no coupling between the elements. The proposed technique
was performed in Matlab using YUMA data to emulate
GNSS signal reception. In this experiment, the motion of
satellites, satellite clock drift and receiver clock drift were
assumed to be completely compensated prior to performing
the proposed technique. The acquisition of GPS IF raw data
was performed through a National Instrument data
acquisition card and the front-end module of four antennas
(inbuilt 2-bit ADC), in which each front-end acquired data
simultaneously. A digital interference simulator was
adopted to generate CWI and a spoofer was employed to
generate a spooﬁng signal. These signals were combined
via two combiners. The received signal was sent to a PCIe-
6536 signal acquisition card [27]. The raw data length was
600 ms at the sampling frequency of 16.368 MHz and
digital IF of 4.092 MHz.
Fig. 7 illustrates the received C/N0 of each satellite signal
with a spooﬁng signal. Two examples were adopted to
analyse the performance of the proposed scheme in which
desired signals of PRN 6 with stronger C/N0 and PRN 13
with weaker C/N0 were vulnerable to spooﬁng signals and
CWI, respectively.
4.2.1 Scenario 1: This example was used to test the
performance of the proposed method in the presence of a
spooﬁng signal. Two sets of data with a length of 600 ms
were acquired. With the ﬁrst dataset, the C/N0 of each
satellite signal was calculated without using the proposed
scheme. With the second dataset, variations in C/N0 were
observed between the two signals using the proposed
scheme in an attempt to distinguish between the desired
signal and the spooﬁng signal. Fig. 7 demonstrates the C/N0
curve of two satellites with non-identical PRN 6 following
the addition of a spooﬁng signal without implementation of
the proposed scheme.
The effective C/N0 (Unid-PRN 6) was calculated to be
approximately 41.3 and 38.9 dB Hz, as shown in Fig. 7.
Following initiation of the proposed method, the decision
logic switched to mode 3 (anti-SPS) at 20 ms. Following
19 iterations (each Matlab iteration time is 6.53 s), the
estimated error of direction reached convergence. The
three-dimensional gain pattern after error convergence (19
iterations) is shown in Fig. 8. The estimated error of
the azimuth and elevation angle for the desired signal
(authentic PRN 6) were 1.5 and 0.88, respectively. Fig. 9
indicates that the effective C/N0 of the desired signal
gradually increased through each iteration. Conversely, the
effective C/N0 of the spooﬁng signal did not increase,
but actually decreased by 4.2 dB. This indicates that the
effective C/N0 with greater variation belongs to authentic
signal and the other is a spoofer. Once the desired signal
was determined, SPSFLAG ¼ 0 and the decision logic
remained in hold mode.
4.2.2 Scenario 2: This experiment depicts the switch status
of each module and whether a spooﬁng signal can be
identiﬁed under the co-existence of a spooﬁng signal and
CWI. Two datasets were used in the the experiment. The
ﬁrst dataset received through the signal acquisition card
included the desired signal and a spooﬁng signal with
non-identical PRN 13. Each C/N0 of the two unidentiﬁed
signals was then calculated. The second data included
additional CWI. The ﬁrst and second datasets were acquired
simultaneously and stored in the computer. Fig. 10 shows
the variation in the C/N0 of the desired signal and the
spooﬁng signal with and without implementation of the
proposed method. The ﬁrst data provided the acquisition
results of the desired signal and spooﬁng signal without
using the proposed scheme. The C/N0 of the two signals
(Unid-PRN 13) was 37.2 and 39.1 dB Hz, respectively.
At this point, the desired signal and spooﬁng signal had not

algorithm. The complexity of the system is comparatively
simple. Thanks to advancements in micro-mechatronics,
developmental costs are likely to be reduced in the future.
The approach proposed in this study is capable of countering
multiple types of interference with a performance reaching
47 dB. The multiplex-switching mechanism enables a system
design much the same as normal receivers in circumstances
with no interference. Unlike conventional receivers, which
perform interference mitigation continuously, the proposed
mechanism saves a considerable amount of calculation time
and is very ﬂexible in design.
6 Conclusion
No single anti-J technique has been able to meet the demands
of all GPS interference anti-J objectives, deal with all
associated problems and satisfy the requirements of size,
cost, performance and hardware complexity. Spatial nulling
poses a threat to GPS visibility and performance. Temporal
ﬁltering does not sufﬁciently address wideband noise
jamming, which can result in delays in GPS acquisition
when multiple ﬁlters are activated. The performance of
GPS/inertial coupling depends on IMU/INS accuracy (and
cost) and GPS satellite visibility.
This paper applies a multiplexing scheme to anti-J GNSS
receivers to deal with the simultaneous presence of various
types of interference. This method combines adaptive
antenna array techniques, frequency excision, interference
detection and decision logic to resist spooﬁng signals
and CWI. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate
that the application of the proposed scheme enables the
detection and mitigation of CWI. Moreover, the proposed
method can safeguard the receiver from spooﬁng signals to
avoid positioning error. The operation of the mechanism
depends on a switching system, which is ﬂexible and
can be integrated into current receivers without the need to
re-design their internal structure.

Abstract: This paper presents a genetic-based control scheme that not only utilizes 
evolutionary characteristics to find the signal acquisition parameters, but also employs an 
adaptive scheme to control the search space and avoid the genetic control converging to 
local optimal value so as to acquire the desired signal precisely and rapidly. Simulations 
and experiment results show that the proposed method can improve the precision of signal 
parameters and take less signal acquisition time than traditional serial search methods for 
global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals.  
Keywords: GNSS; synchronization; genetic control 
 
1. Introduction 
The positioning and time information provided by the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) 
has been extensively applied to navigation, military and civil currently, among which the global 
positioning system (GPS) developed in America from the early 1970’s has been utilized in military 
applications. Each GPS satellite simultaneously transmits on two L-band frequencies, denoted by L1 
and L2, which are 1575.42 and 1227.60 MHz, respectively, and the PRN code modulates with the 
L-band frequency. The PRN code consists of C/A (coarse acquisition) code on L1 carrier and P code

vicinity of the corresponding parameters of that set of individual. In the next iteration, the signal search 
space is narrowed down, the sets of individual are decreased and the threshold is increased. If the 
fitness value exceeds the maximum threshold, the result of acquisition is successful. Otherwise, the 
acquisition result may simply contain noise, which calls for a repeated run of evolution process. 
Although this method speeds up signal search time, the acquired parameter value can be a local 
optimal solution. Thus, an adaptive scaling scheme is utilized to assure a global solution during the 
signal acquisition process. Simulations and experiment results reveal that this method not only saves 
signal search time but also finds more accurate signal acquisition parameters for GPS signal. 
Comparison results of the published methods are also demonstrated in this paper.  
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the signal acquisition process and 
the possible problems to be encountered. Section 3 depicts how to apply the proposed method to 
GNSS signal acquisition. Section 4 explains the simulation and experimental procedure of the 
proposed method and provides the performance evaluation and comparison of published methods with 
the proposed method. An example is listed to analyze the feasibility of this method. Finally, Section 5 
summarizes the key points of this paper. 
2. Problem Formulation 
2.1. Signal Model 
The major purpose of this paper is to employ an evolution method to enhance the performance of 
GNSS signal acquisition. Under the scenario of ignoring data modulation and interference, the 
incoming signal is down-converted and then transferred to a digital Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal. 
The signal at sampling time, 
kt , can be described as: 
( ) = ( )exp( 2 ( ) ) + ( )k k c d k kr t PG t τ j π f + f t +θ w t-  (1) 
where P  is the power of the direct line-of-sight GNSS signal, cf  is the IF and 1j   . The 
variables 
df , θ  and τ  denote the Doppler frequency, carrier phase, and code delay, respectively. 
The noise components ( )kw t  are referred to as white Gaussian noise distribution, in which the power 
spectrum density is 
0N 2/ . The 0N  stands for single sideband power spectrum density of noise. 
( )G   is the filtered code sequence expressed by C/A-code, P-code or binary offset carrier (BOC) 
signal [12,21,22].  
2.2. Correlation and Detection Process 
The baseband signal ( )kr t  multiplies a locally generated replica and the result is processed 
through correlation operation. The resultant output is expressed as:

achieve a certain probability of false alarm in noise alone by employing the well-known 
Neyman–Pearson criterion [26].  
The above depiction shows that what concerns the designer is to rapidly find the required u  and 
v  in a short time so as to have the correlation exceed the set threshold. The following chapters 
demonstrate that the proposed acquisition method can effectively speed up signal acquisition speed 
and maintain high estimated parameter precision.  
3. Methodology  
The acquisition time and the precision of signal parameters lie in the signal search space and each 
search step size. That is, the guessed number of trial search point determines each time the signal 
search time. Although a smaller step size increases the precision of estimated signal parameter, it also 
increases search times, which causes longer acquisition time. Contrariwise, the larger the step size, the 
more loss of correlation. In the GC process, the search space (including frequency and code space) and 
the number of acquisition trial points are adjusted to shorten signal search time. The adaptive scaling 
scheme is to enhance the accuracy of signal parameters. In the following, the whole process of 
proposed method applied to signal acquisition is illustrated. 
3.1. Signal Acquisition with Genetic Control  
Step 1. Doppler frequency and code delay encoding 
The first step in employing GC to conduct signal acquisition is to convert the locally generated 
Doppler frequency and code delay to string by way of a binary encoding method [27]. The respective 
upper bound of Doppler frequency and code delay ( max,upu  and max,upv ) is converted to string and the 
length is expressed as m  and n , respectively.

where 
fS  and gS  are the Doppler frequency and code delay individuals, respectively. m  and n are 
the maximum bit number of Doppler frequency and code delay individuals. Each bit in the individual 
is termed as genetic gene. 
Step 2. Fitness function determination 
After the parameters are encoded, it is necessary to define fitness function to evaluate the quality of 
each individual. To put it simply, fitness function is the performance index which determines the 
quality of the individual, retains the superior gene and removes the inferior gene in order to gradually 
upgrade the overall performance index through evolution by generation. During the signal acquisition 
process, the signal detection margin serves as fitness function, which is defined by

Step 6. Mutation 
In biological systems, besides natural selection, an organism goes through mutation to adapt itself 
to its surroundings in order to survive. The above-depicted procedure merely maintains original 
individuals and combines superior genes from different individuals with high fitness levels. However, 
no matter how many times reproduction and crossover take place, the GC does not produce 
characteristics that are inherently absent in individuals. The function of mutation lies in producing 
characteristics which are originally absent in high-fitness individuals. The k th-  bit of thi-  Doppler 
frequency individual fS

Although the above method can acquire the optimal value, large population size is required during 
search process, which often leads to longer computation time. To reduce search time, the population 
size and search space boundary are automatically adjusted during each iteration process to speed up 
search time. The following is the process of the proposed method. 
3.2. GC with Adaptive Scaling Scheme 
In each iteration, fixed and large numbers of initial populations result in a longer signal search time. 
As a result, the initial detection of the presence of a desired signal (the signal parameters have not been 
accurately acquired yet) allows us to decrease the number of initial populations in the next search. The 
( 1) thp  iteration of initial population size is as follows:  
( 1) ( )
1 ( )
p p
p p max maxZ Z / Q / Q

   (13) 
where ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )1 2 3 zmax{ , , ,... }
p p p p p
maxQ Q Q Q Q . When the 
( )p
maxQ  exceeds the noise floor, GC method 
initiates two procedures. The first procedure is that when ( )pmaxQ  exceeds the set detection threshold v  
(depicted in Section 2), it indicates that the desired signal has been acquired and the GC process 
terminates. The second procedure is when the ( )pmaxQ  is between the detection threshold and the initial 
detection threshold. In such case, the adaptive scaling scheme begins to control the number of initial 
population. The initial detection margin is set at 1 4. Q  and the definition of Q  is the same as that in 
Equation 7. The only difference is that Q  is the fitness value acquired under the scenario of no 
desired signal. Meanwhile, the scaler also controls and adjusts the search space of Doppler frequency 
and code delay, which is depicted in the following:

4.3. Simulation Results 
A large number of initial populations can speed up signal search time, but is also requires a higher 
hardware cost. The initial population size, crossover and mutation probability value are set, based on 
an experience rule to be successfully utilized in the GC process to acquire desired signals. Figure 3 
shows the examples for the evolution values of two parameters (Doppler frequency and code delay) for 
C/A-code. The protruding “○” in Figure 3 is caused by mutation in GC. The two figures  
(Figure 3a,b) show that in utilizing the adaptive scaling scheme, the signal search space will gradually 
narrow down its space after each iteration to ensure the estimated signal parameter to converge to 
global optimal value and also reduce iteration times. Contrariwise, a longer acquisition time is required 
without using the scheme. Figure 4 illustrates the 2D signal search path using the proposed method in 
application to different signal types, which include C/A-code, P-code and BOC. These diagrams show 
that the use of GC can effectively reduce search times. On the other hand, Figure 5 analyzes the 
relation between the number of initial population and search times regarding C/A-code. The result 
demonstrates that when the number of initial population adopts a roughly 1.5 times code period length 
of C/A-code (1023 chip), the signal can be accurately acquired within fewer search times under  
C/No = 45 dB-Hz. When the number of the initial population is below 0.5 times code period length, 
the proposed method cannot acquire the signal. Such a result is the same with P-code and BOC.

converges to a local optimal solution and thus the signal acquisition engine repeats the search process, 
which increases the iteration number. The same scenario also happens to the GC method without an 
adaptive scaling scheme in the case of PRN-8 and PRN-4. Figure 6a,b depicts the acquisition 
parameter search curve of frequency shift and code delay versus iteration number, respectively. Figure 
6a shows that the proposed scheme converges to a local optimal solution in the 18th iteration and thus 
restarts search process. In the 29th iteration the proposed scheme converges to a global optimal 
solution and successfully acquires a signal parameter. Table 2 compares the performances of the 
proposed method with a traditional (serial search) method [1] for PRN-8. This table shows that the 
proposed method can successfully acquire the satellite signal in the sky. Note that search times for 
PRN-8 and PRN-4 are longer because the signal power of the satellite is weaker.

Abstract  This paper investigates the existing spatial-temporal interference suppression methods which attempt to miti-
gate interference before the GNSS receiver performs correlation. These methods comprise non-blind signal processing 
techniques and blind signal processing techniques by using the antenna array. Also, an extensive comparison of these tech-
niques for GNSS is established, which is evaluated from the view of convergence rate, numerical stability, computational 
loads, and realization complexity. The research offers a foundation of the spatial-temporal adaptive processing (STAP) 
practical realization and the design for new processors.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, spatial-temporal adaptive processing 
(STAP) is a well- known technique that has been proposed to 
remove narrowband interference and eliminate broadband 
interferences[1-5]. Most of these algorithms may be catego-
rized into three classes according to whether a training signal 
is used or not. One class of these algorithms is the non-blind 
adaptive algorithm in which a training signal is used to adjust 
the array weight vector. Another technique is to use a blind 
adaptive algorithm which does not require a training signal. 
Still another is semi-blind adaptive algorithm in which the 
desired signal information can be obtained by inertia navi-
gation system. 
Generally, it takes three steps to employ STAP so as to 
deal with interference mitigation. The first step is to estimate 
the covariance matrix of input signal. The second step is to 
utilize adaptive algorithm in order to obtain weight vector. 
The last step is to output signal through the addition acquired 
by weighting the measurement data. Each algorithm out-
performs others in a specific way. For example, some are 
better in performance. However, they are higher in imple-
mentation complexity and longer in computation time, which 
makes it difficult in real time processing and hardware im-
plementation. As a result, in addition to taking performance 
into consideration, we must also consider hardware imple-
mentation complexity and computation cost. Besides, huge 
adoption of multiplications/additions also increases cost. 
Thus, proper adjustment in algorithm form such as reduced

rank and possible implementation can upgrade system per-
formance to a certain degree. This paper focuses on analyses 
and evaluation of the performance of commonly used STAP 
techniques in order to further understand the benefits and 
drawbacks and provide evaluation reference in hardware 
implementation. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 gives a description of GPS signal model. It also briefly 
reviews various types of STAP algorithm. The comparison 
of STAP requirement and implementation complexity is 
given in Section 3. Finally, a short summary follows in Sec-
tion 4. 
2. Stap Overview 
In this section we analyze an adaptive spatial-temporal 
processing for GPS interference mitigation processing. The 
design criterion of adaptive antenna algorithm can be im-
posed at spatial domain or temporal domain. One class of 
these algorithms is the non-blind adaptive algorithm in 
which a training signal is used to adjust the array weight 
vector. For example, it contains least-mean squares method 
(LMS)[6], sample matrix inversion method (SMI)[7], re-
cursive least-squares (RLS) method[8], minimum variance 
distortionless response (MVDR) method[9,10], and multi-
stage nested wiener filter (MSNWF)[11], etc. Another tech-
nique is to use a blind adaptive algorithm which does not 
require a training signal. Namely, it consists of power 
minimization (PM) method[12], and Reduced-rank PM ap-
proach, etc. These techniques are employed to dynamically 
adjust antenna array pattern response to further reduce the 
power of interfering signal sources. In this section, according 
to the results of study, we give the general spatial-temporal 
  Electrical and Electronic Engineering. 2011; 1(2): 79-84 81 
  
 
following expression:  
( ) 11 1 1Hopt M
−− −
×=w R A A R A 1       (16) 
The MVDR weight vector assumes that the covariance 
matrix, R , is known, and is referred to as an optimal 
beamformer. However, the existence of steering vector error 
worsens the performance of the approach. In practice the 
covariance matrix is not known but rather must be estimated 
using training data. 
2.5. PM Algorithm 
Because the received GPS signal power is well below the 
thermal noise floor, we can simply constrain the weight on 
the first tap of reference antenna 1, and then minimize the 
output power, namely:  
=1H H MNmin s .t .w w Rw w c
          (17) 
where [ ]= 0 1 0 HMN , , ,c   is the 1MN× vector. The 
weights for the auxiliary antennas are determined when those 
which drive the output power of the beamformer are down to 
the noise floor as possible. Thus, using the method of La-
grange multipliers, the solution to (17) is 
1
-1
1= MNH
MN MN
−w R c
c R c
            (18) 
This approach has the advantage of not requiring the di-
rection of arrival (DOA) GPS signal information. It can also 
be implemented easily. 
2.6. Reduced-Rank PM Algorithm 
Owing to the large dimensionality of the spatial-temporal 
covariance matrix and weight vector, STAP techniques will 
result in a larger computational burden and convergence 
slowly. Consequently, the reduced-dimension method has 
been proposed recently. Reduced-dimension methods are 
mainly adopted so as to constraint weight vector to lie in a 
lower dimensional subspace by the transformation matrix 
( )NM J J NMD × < , namely let: 
= NM J× rw D w                (19) 
so (17) can be described as 
= 1H H H H NMmin s .t .r r rw w D RDw w D c
     (20) 
the solution to (18) is

        (21) 
where HD RD  is Hermitian-symmetric with J J×  di-
mension matrix, which is less than the one of R , it leads to 
lower computational complexity and rapid convergence. 
The reduced dimension transformation matrix D  can be 
found by techniques such as the cross-spectral (CS) metric or 
principal-components (PC). 
2.7. MSNWF Technique 
Dr. Zoltowski proposed a reduced-dimension STAP 
technique based on MSNWF. It is illustrated that the 
MSNWF does not require computing the inversion of R , 
thereby reducing computational complexity. The MSWF 
algorithm is summarized below. The interpretation of the 
“desired” signal 0 ( )z k  varies amongst the different type of 
spatial-temporal processors.

involve complex vector-vector products, not complex ma-

straint), there by indicating computational complexity

3. System Computation Requirement 
and Comparison 
The computation requirements in STAP techniques arise 
from the need to cancel unwanted interference and improve 
the signal-to-noise ratio. Figure 1 shows the STAP typically 
performed in one coherent processing interval, which con-
sist of L  blocks, M  delay time tap, and N  antenna 
elements. The resulting training set is used to compute the 
  Electrical and Electronic Engineering. 2011; 1(2): 79-84 83 
  
 
If the computation load is too high when utilizing STAP in 
real time, there is not only difficulty in system implementa-
tion but also loss of real time on line. Table 2 illustrates 
multiplications, additions as well as memory required in 
single measurement data through different STAP algorithms. 
Take SMI for example. We consider inverse matrix op-
erator, which requires multiplications ( )2 +2 +1NM NM  and 
additions ( )2 +2 -1NM NM . The computational load needed in 
adjusting the weight value requires multiplications 3 NM  
and additions ( )2 +1NM , which calls for multiplications 
( )2 +5 1NM NM +  and additions ( )22 +2NM NM  in total compu-
tation complexity. In addition, it requires at least memory 
( )2 2 2NM + NM +  unit and total computational load ( )3[ ]NMΟ  
unit. If the dimension of matrix is too high in SMI, the 
computational load will be too large to be utilized in hard-
ware implementation. When we compare LMS and RLS, 
LMS is simpler in hardware complexity, which is due to the 
calculation of gain vector factor in RLS.(see Table 2) It takes 
large computation load in MVDR because the weight vector 
of each antenna has to be adjusted in this algorithm. In con-
trast, the weight vector of only single antenna has to be ad-
justed in PM. Therefore, MVDR is higher in hardware im-
plementation complexity. The computational time in Re-
duced-rank PM and MSNWF is far shorter than that in other 
algorithms, which is due to the fact that they do not require 
inverse matrix value and in turn, the computational time is 
much shorter. 
4. Conclusions 
This paper makes comparisons and analyses from typical 
STAP performance, mainly from not only computation load, 
multiplications and additions required in algorithm but also 
realization complexity. The research analysis is derived as 
follows: Firstly, MSNWF is best in performance. This ap-
proach employs reduced rank to proceed; therefore, its 
complexity is the lowest in hardware implementation. 
However, this algorithm is also limited because the infor-
mation of satellite signal direction should be required in 
advance. Secondly, LMS is easier in hardware implementa-
tion. However, because its steady state error is larger, its 
performance is worse and not practical in general condition. 
Thirdly, RLS and SMI are only second to MSNWF in 
performance. Nevertheless, their computation load is the 
highest. Under the condition of heavy interference, the 
adoption of multiple antennas and tap number makes them 
(RLS and SMI) higher in hardware implementation com-
plexity than other algorithms. As a result, they are not prac-
tical in use. Fourthly, PM and Reduced-rank PM are medium 
in performance. These two approaches do not require the 
information of satellite direction. Moreover, because Re-
duced-rank PM utilizes reduced rank, the time needed in 
computation load is greatly reduced, which makes it rather 
convenient in hardware implementation. We can acquire 
transformation matrix by such methods as CS or PC. How-
ever, both methods are quite a computational burden since it 
is necessary to produce eigenvectors of covariance matrix 
before finding transformation matrix. 
Lastly, MVDR is more stable in performance without 
beamforming. Though its hardware implementation com-
plexity is higher, it can be a good choice when the antenna 
numbers are fewer. From the above analyses, we can dis-
tinguish the benefits and drawbacks of STAP performance 
and in turn provide a reference for future hardware imple-
mentation and development of new processors. To sum up, a 
processor can not be generally and broadly defined as supe-
rior or inferior. Nevertheless, under certain condition and 
requirement, it is possible to evaluate the overall perform-
ance.

ABSTRACT 
 
In this paper, the scenario where a modified compressive sampling algorithm 
acquires global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal contaminated by 
an interfering signal is presented. Note that if the interfering signal exists in 
a known subspace orthogonal to the desired signal, the compressive 
measurements are projected into an orthogonal subspace and then the 
interference is nulled out. Besides, the interference cancellation method 
keeps the restricted isometry property (RIP) of the sampling process which 
assures that distances between desired signals in the space are not influenced 
by the sampling process. Therefore, the state embedding of desired signal 
stays in the compressive domain and the proposed method remains robust in 
term of  measurement noise and sampling non-idealities. The simulation 
result shows that the proposed method can enhance signal acquisition 
performance under the presence of interference. It is shown that cancelling 
the interference in the compressive sampling process is helpful in subsequent 
signal acquisition in contrast to the fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based 
excisor approach.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Interference mitigation conducted within the receiver typically consists of antenna array 
technique, signal pre-processing and signal post-processing. Though antenna array technique 
can yield better interference mitigation performance among the three, the internal design of 
civilian receiver generally adopts the second and third method to eliminate interference signal 
based on cost consideration. The most prevalent methods include frequency excision or 
temporal cancellation method in terms of interferences. Frequency excision method transfers 
  
 
y  to reconstruct s . Apparently, because the dimension of y  is for below that of s , (1) is open 
to numerous solutions, which renders it difficult to reconstruct original signal. Equation (2) 
can be utilized to calculate sparse signal vector by solving the following 1A -norm constrained 
minimization: 
1
ˆ argmin s. t .
s
s = s        s = y
∈
Φ
^N
        (2) 
where 
1
ˆ ss ≅ ∑ k
k
 represents the 1A -norm of s . The problem formulation has been extended 
to the case of noisy measurements as follows 
Φy = s + w            (3) 
where M ×1∈w ^  denotes a additive Gaussian noise vector. In the noisy case, s  can be 
recovered using the following convex optimization program (Candes et al., 2006):  
1 2
ˆ argmin s.t .
N×1∈
 − Φ ≤ ε
s
s = s      y s
^
        (4) 
where 
2
  i  indicates the 2A -norm and the error ε  is chosen so that it bounds the amount of 
noise in the measurements. Candues pointed out that M measurement must satisfy M = O(K 
ln(N)) in order to accurately reconstruct sparse signal s .  
 
Besides, matrix Φ  must satisfy restricted isometry property (RIP) (Candes et al., 2006) and 
incoherence with any fixed basis. The least squares (LS) estimation technique is employed to 
estimate s  as follows: 
H Hˆ ( )−1Φ Φ Φs = y           (5) 
where H( )i  represents the complex conjugate-transpose operation. Once sˆ  is acquired, the 
transformation matrix Ψ  and the following equation are employed to yield the estimated 
value xˆ  of original signal. 
ˆxˆ = sΨ            (6) 
 
That is the core concept of compressive sensing method, different from conventional 
sampling method. With regards to compressive sensing, it utilizes few linear measurement to 
solve optimal problem (4) so s  to obtain the compressive measurement y  of signal xˆ . By so 
doing, it overcomes the drawback of Shannon sampling theory.  
 
 
2.2 CS-based Interference Elimination Approach 
 
In GPS cases, the signals are not only contaminated by Gaussian noise, but also corrupted by 
continue wave interference (CWI), which renders signal acquisition more challenging. In this 
session, two CWI mitigation methods will be demonstrated based on compressive domain. 
Assume the incoming sparse signal vector N×1∈s ^  is made up of two components: 
 +d js = s s            (7) 
where N×1∈ds ^  denotes the signal vector of interest with unit amplitude and N×1∈js ^  
indicates the narrowband interference vector to be rejected. Thus, the vector-valued linear 
  
 
first constructing a linear operator T  that operates on the measurements ′y . The design of Λ  
is based only on the measurement matrix Φ  and knowledge of the support of jx . Thus, (8) is 
expressed as 
+ ′= Φ( )c d jy  T x x  + w          (12) 
The matrix T  cancels out the interference jx  from the samples cy . Assume = ΦΨJ , The 
( )
J
M M J× −Φ ∈^  is derived as an orthonormal basis for the null space of TJ  by singular value 
decomposition(SVD) (Moon et al., 2000). Then T  is designed as follows: 
T T= ( )−1Φ Φ ΦJ J JT           (13) 
 
When interference is nulled out, (1) is given by 
ˆ ′= Φc dy  T x + w           (14) 
 
2.3 Signal Detection 
  
2.3.1 Without narrowband interference 
 
The signal detection procedure that obtains measurements is reviewed by directly sampling 
the received signal. Suppose Nyquist sampling is achievable, then the desired signal detection 
problem is to distinguish between two hypotheses (Elad, 2007; Chang et al., 2008): 
0
1
: =
: = d
 y w
 y x w+
H
H
          (15) 
where w  denotes the correlation noise, obeying the ( )20 N,σ I`  distribution, where ( ),∗` D  
represents Gaussian distribution with expectation of ∗  and variance of D .  
 
Under hypothesis 1H , a satellite signal is visible and the signal is present; whereas under 
hypothesis 0H , the signal is absent. 
On condition that 1H  is true, the probability of detection, represented by dP , is the probability 
of selecting 1H  whereas under 0H  is true, the probability of false alarm, denoted by fP  , is the 
probability of selecting 1H . Based on the Neyman-Pearson (NP) criterion, the optimum 
decision strategy maximizes dP  while maintaining fP  under a certain value. It is 
demonstrated that the performance of the matched filter is given by (Kay, 1998): 
T 2[ ( ) ]d fP Q Q P /
−1
≈ − ( ) σs s          (16) 
where 1( )
2
x
x
Q x e dx
2
∞
−
2≅
π
∫ . Though the detection performance is optimal, this method 
requires fully sampled data, which calls for high requirements on sampling, post-processing 
and storage resources.   
 
The second approach that offers a general data acquisition strategy is the compressive 
detector (Haupt et al., 2006). This detector functions on a reduced set of M N≤  compressive 
  
 
 
A. SubCS-domain detection 
Equation (10) and (13) show that the hypothesis problem can be reduced to the following 
under interference: 
0
1
: = ( )
: = ( )
H
H +
Θ Φ +
Θ Φ Φ +
j j
d d j j
 y x w
 y x x w
         (25) 
Under hypothesis 1H , y  reduces to: = ( )Θ Φ +d dy x w . Therefore, the CWI is nulled out at the 
measurement stage. Note that the design of the subspace measurement matrices based on (10) 
incorporates the principle of zero-forcing equalizer (Wang et al., 1998; John, 2000). The 
interference, if present, is totally cancelled out by projecting the received signal onto the 
interference null space. Then the incoming signal is again projected onto the desired signal 
subspace to reduce the noise effect. 
 
When the focus is on the detection of an unknown sparse signal with CWI mitigation, the 
satisfying statistics is written as: 
T T
2
( )= > Th
σ
−1ΘΘΓy
y y          (26) 
The detection performance is the same as (21) and (22), where the noncentrality parameter λ  
is: 
T T T
2
[ ( ) )]=λ
σ
⊥ −1 −1Φ Φd dx U U P U Ux         (27) 
Signal energy loss occurs when projecting the received signal onto the null space of the 
interference. Performance loss can be expected in contrast to the case of no interference. 
 
B. CS-domain detection 
It is worth noting that if the compressive measurement is obtained without exploiting any 
signal structure, the contribution of the interference can still be eliminated with the 
interference subspace known a priori. Thus,  
+ ′= Φ( )d jy T x x  + w          (28) 
From (11), (12) and (15), the detection problem can be formulated as: 
0
1
: = ( )
: = )
H
H
Φ +
Φ( + +
j
d j
 y T x w
 y T x x w
         (29) 
Under hypothesis 1H , y  reduces to = )Φ( +dy T x w . Assume 2 T( )= σ Φ ΦA T T , = Φ dB Tx . 
Then, a satisfying statistics can be given by: 
T T T( )  > Th−1 −1 −1 −1 ′Γ =y y A B B A B B A y         (30) 
The detection performance can be obtained from the distribution of Γy  and is the same as (21) 
and (22), where the noncentrality parameter is: 
T T T
2
( ) ( ( ) ) )]λ
σ
−1 −1Φ Φ Φ Φ
=
d dx T T T U T x        (31) 
The performance of the compressive detector with CWI mitigation will be evaluated in the simulation. 
  
 
 
 
Figure 1. Performance of signal detector with and without (w/o) interference mitigation. The 
simulation parameters are set as: N = 5000 , K= 500 , sM =380 , cM = 2500 , SNR = 15 dB, and INR 
= 30 dB.

4. CONCLUSION 
 
In this paper, the CS-based interference elimination methods are proposed for the detection of 
sparse GPS signals under interference. The detection methods are robust against waveform 
quantization and interference. The simulation results show that the application of SubCS-
domain approach under the condition of one interference can increase the output SNR  value 
to 1~2dB and efficiently remove interference as well as noise as opposed to the CS-domain 
method.

 consumes a lot of work days and manpower fee under huge areas and large numbers of 
crops. In recent years, with the on-going development of mechatronic techniques, traditional 
manual work has been replaced by automatic mechanics. Numerous researches have 
addressed the topic of autonomous vehicles for use in agricultural, and the robotics industry 
has produced a wide variety of remarkable robots. The maturation of micromechanics 
(MEMS) has expanded the potential of design techniques used for automatic machines, the 
most noteworthy of which is intelligent vehicle systems (Li et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2011; 
Barawid et al., 2007; Raimondi et al., 2005; Freire et al., 2000; Huntsberger et al., 1999).  
 
This paper focuses on short-distance detection techniques using low-cost sensors and 
controllers to meet short-range navigational demands. All systems incorporated into the 
structure proposed autonomous robotic vehicle are controlled using an embedded board. 
The principle components of this vehicle are the platform on which all systems are mounted, 
the processor, the power circuitry, the motor controller, and finally the sensors, including 
optical wheel encoders, low cost laser range sensors, temperature/humidity (humiture) 
sensory, and a color sensor. Determining the means to effectively combine these sensor 
devices, to provide accurate data related to the position of the vehicle and meet the 
requirement of low cost is the main thrust of this research. In addition, the use of four-wheel 
structure for vehicle movement and equipped with sprayer in the end of tractor which can 
effectively perform spray function. 
 
In this paper, the use of neural learning ability from the adjustment of appropriate 
membership functions is adopted to design a neuro-fuzzy obstacle avoidance system. The 
application of neural self-learning mode to adjust the width and center value of membership 
functions in fuzzy system allows the laser range sensor module to send the correct message 
to the steering control system and achieve the function of obstacle avoidance. 
 
DESIGN CONCEPT 
 
SYSTEM PLANNING 
 
The functions required for the vehicle to follow a regulated route for application in agriculture 
related tasks are as follows: 1) a durable chassis to house the necessary sensors and drive 
equipment; 2) the vehicle must able to avoid obstacles; 3) supplied power sufficient to 
operate devices for at least 1.5 hours; 4) fast microprocessor to control the devices and 
process incoming data; 5) integrated range sensor to correct positioning data; 6) orientation 
data to enable the robot to place itself in the path; 7) capability to perform specific tasks, such 
as spraying; and 8) computer equipped with software capable of receiving data from the 
vehicle and identifying the position according to the given data. All decisions related to 
design were done so in accordance with specified design criteria. The design of an 
autonomous vehicle must take into consideration its environment, the weight it carries, and 
the size of the vehicle. The design implemented in this study included a simple chassis, two 
drive wheels and an embedded processor.  
 
The feature of proposed vehicle is as follows: 
(1) Indentify the objects with color sensor. 
(2) Detect environment temperature (-5~70 degrees) and humidity (10 ~ 100%). 
(3) Climbing ability (30 degrees); high across ability with 5 to 8 cm in height. 
(4) Omni-directional operation and the speed of vehicle up to 3 cm/sec. 
(5) Obstacle detection capabilities: To detect the obstacle in front of the vehicle which the

 and record the location parameters of the laser range finder and motor reaction. These 
parameters serve as a learning training sample data in neural network. Table 1 depicts the 
training data for neural network.

中，有效的達到農用載具自主無人化的目的。 
關鍵詞：自動化、模糊邏輯、噴灌車。 
 
1. 緒論 
 
自主性載具的種類大致可區分為陸海空三
種，目前已應用至農業、民生導覽、探勘、災害救
援，自動駕駛以及軍事偵搜行動[1,2,3,4,5]。相關
報告指出，在未來十年中，自主性載具的開發市場
將大幅提升，估計至 2019 年將大幅成長至 776 百
萬美金[6]。因此，各家廠商無不積極開始開發相
關關鍵技術。就以目前法國所開發的 Cycab 為例，
其外型有如高爾夫球車，內建系統包含全球衛星導
航技術，透過觸摸屏設定行進路線，就能夠載你往
想去的地方，同時也能夠順利避開障礙物。另外，
美國每年所舉辦的城市挑戰賽中，許多團隊也設計
出無人化自動操控系統，其中，較引人注目則是來
自學界的史丹佛大學所組成的團隊在 2007 年奪得
冠軍[7]。 
在軍事方面，美國國防部先進研究計劃機構
指出，在未來的戰場中，自主性載具的加入卓實會
影響整個作戰系統的型態。現今國際間已逐漸對於
系統運作平台、軟硬體系統、以及通訊介面相關模
組開始進行研發。國際學者 John Edward 在 2011
年 IEEE 訊號處理雜誌中報告指出[8]，下一世代的
重要產業即是智慧車以及與羽量型載具，而此載具
設計當然也包含農用載具。目前的自動化農業載具
的設計方式，已朝向功能整合式的方式來進行，由
於農用機具的設計考量較為複雜，其包含果農專用
移動式採收機、聯合收穫機、割草機等等
[9,10,11]。而目前台灣在這部份的設計研發技術相
較於美國、日本來說較為落後，且這方面的設計專
利數量上尚為缺乏。因此，本研究主要目的在於開
發低成本之自動化農用型載具關鍵技術，配合智慧
化多感測融合技術來完成自主導航功能以及農作
物檢測、灑水與噴藥的需求，並期望將其應用於自
動化農業生產作業中，以減輕農民工作上的負擔。 
在面積與農作物數量龐大的環境下，傳統技
術之利用人力來做維護與檢測的工作，不僅需耗掉
不少的工作天數，也需支付大量的人力費用。以菜
園為例，在每作物上架設管線或感測器而達到節省
人力的目的，在ㄧ般空間還可接受，但園地太大
時，設置成本也將跟著提高。因此，設計一套具有
自主性功能的農用載具不但可以解決搬重、採收時
的人力，同時還可節省作業時間。在目前自主性載
具的開發研究中，常見到的有利用全球衛星導航接
收機[11]、雷射測距儀[10]、多顆超音波感測器、
紅外線感測器、慣性導航元件[1,3,4]以及外加圖資
系統的配合來完成戶外長距離行走的應用。然而，
高的開發建置成本費用也造成使用者是否採用上
的考量，另外，自主無人導航載具應用在戶外工作
時，需要克服的不確定性相對較多，如地面的不平
整、光線的強弱以及機構本身設計上的瓶頸。 
因此，本文所提出的設計概念主要著重於低
成本之自主導航感測技術的建立[5]，該自主性載
具系統包含馬達控制模組、感測模組以及後端監控
模組。其中感測模組由簡易型雷射測距模組、里程
計、顏色辨識器、溫溼度感測器等所組成，主要目
的在於避障以及檢測的功能。此載具裝設低成本之
微機電元件，其重量輕、耗電量少，組裝、維護容
易，並有益於使用者在操作上的方便性。

首先以目標點之相對位置來設計一階層式模
糊控制器，來對載具做運動控制，調整此控制器中
的相關參數，使其控制性能更為良好，最後以模擬
結果觀察本實驗階層式模糊邏輯控制器效果[12]。

4.1 載具設計需求 
 
載具的設計與製作，與載具本身動作、功能
有著相連的關係，因此在機構的設計上，也為計畫
重要一環，以下幾項為設計時最常見的問題： 
(1)、車體機構的尺寸：此為載具設計最具影響力，
對於載具的應用環境、空間，及載具的長寬高
比例，也都對應後續軟硬體設計上的規劃，如
電路控制器、感測器、驅動器及電池的擺放位
置，以及因車體支撐點距離而改變載具轉彎的
角度，連同在重量上也有相對連帶關係。 
(2)、重量與續航力：先以不考慮環境因素，若馬
達的負擔多來自於載具本身重量，為了增加續
航力而增加電池數量，可能導致馬達負擔上
升，比原先功率更低之情況。 
(3)、感測器的選用：感測器的種類、功能、應用、
價格都是考量的選擇，除了普遍常見的為紅外
線感測器與超音波感測器，顧慮到感測的靈敏
度與距離長短，多樣類型感測器該如何搭配才
能達到準確的測量。 
(4)、操作使用的介面：操作介面的功能，除了基
本的啟動、停止、修改參數，也可考量到簡單、
易懂的介面規畫，讓操作者益於發揮功能性。 
(5)、載具應用環境：載具行走路徑常會面臨崎嶇
不平道路或傾斜的坡地，以機構的設計，克
服、適應環境中的問題因素。

the signal to frequency domain and counteracts interference using excision method. However, 
this method fails to completely null out the effect of interference on signal. With regards to 
time-domain processing, the method does not adequately address the wideband noise, and can 
cause global navigation satellite system (GNSS) acquisition delays when multiple filters are 
activated. Besides, regarding frequency domain or time domain processing, the received 
signals must satisfy sampling theory and be transferred to digitalized signals. Excision 
method has to utilize Fast Fourier transform to be transferred to frequency domain. Such a 
process significantly increases the computation time of signal processing within the internal 
receiver.    
 
The sampling theorem states that the sampling rate can not be lower than twice the maximum 
frequency of analog signal be sampled. Otherwise, it results in distortion and aliasing of 
sampled signal. The compressive sensing (CS) concept is proposed by scholars Candes and 
Donoho in 2006. They combined the process of signal compression and sampling. First, the 
non-adaptive linear projection data of signal is acquired. Then, non-linear projection data is 
utilized based on corresponding recovery algorithm to reconstruct original signal. The 
advantage of compressive sensing is that the projection measurement data of signal is far 
smaller than that of traditional method, which overcome the bottleneck of Shannon sampling 
theory and renders high resolution compression possible. Nevertheless, the compressive 
measurements acquired by these systems take up the entire signal space, which often consists 
of undesired interference. Since CS-based signal acquisition and processing is proven to be 
more vulnerable to noise and interference than classical methods. Thus, it is sensible to null 
out as much noise and interference as possible prior to any processing.  
 
In this paper, the proposed compressive domain interference cancellation approach allows us 
to effectively filter out interference from the signals of interest when certain mild sparsity and 
orthogonality conditions are met. Our filtering approach maintains the geometry of the set of 
signals of interest, while it nulls out the interference. 
 
2. METHODOLOGY  
 
2.1 Compressive Sensing Overview 
 
In recent years, compressive sensing (CS) is a emerged field in signal processing that enables 
signal acquisition using very few measurements compared to the signal dimension, while the 
signal is sparse in some basis. In the typical CS framework, the issue of signal reconstruction 
is considered. That is, the knowledge of one signal measurement matrix ×Φ ∈^M N  ( M N ), 
modelling the measurement system and unknown sparse signal vector N×1∈s ^  can yield 
linear measurement M ×1∈y ^ .  
Φ ΦΨy = s = s           (1) 
where =Φ ΦΨ , and ×Φ ∈^M N  represents measurement matrix. Ψ  denotes the transformation 
matrix of unknown signal = Ψx s  converting to sparse signal s . The word “sparse” denotes 
that s  consists of few nonzero K N  elements. Thus, we can exactly recover a sparse signal 
s  from a measurement vector. The solution of the underdetermined system of (1) can be 
calculated. In such cases, CS framework states that we can recover the signal from linear, 
non-adaptive measurements. 
 
Equation (1) can be regarded as the linear projection of signal s  under Φ . Consider the use of

where Φ  denotes measurement matrix as in (1). dx  and jx  are desired signal and interference, 
respectively.  
 
 
2.2.1 Subspace-compressive sensing domain (SubCS-domain) 
 
In this chapter, the appropriate measurement matrix is presented and the incoming signal is 
projected onto CWI null subspace so that CWI can be completely filtered out.  
Consider the interference is modeled by Φ j jx  where Φ j  denotes an N J× matrix whose 
columns span the interference subspace j< >Φ  and jx
J∈^  represents the interference 
coefficient vector with J N K− . Thus, (8) is given by 
+Φ Φsc d d j jy  = x x + w           (9) 
 
Suppose jΦ  is available but jx  is unknown. Note that even when the CWI subspace is 
unknown, we can estimate it from random compressive measurements through compressive 
sensing approaches since the CWI usually has sparse representation in the frequency domain.  
Using subspace compressive measurements, it is desirable to design a measurement matrix 
that eliminate interference and exploits the fact that the signal-of-interest lies in a known 
subspace spanned by the columns of dΦ . It turns out that by letting the projection matrix be 
T T T T= ( ) ( )−1 ⊥ −1 ⊥Θ Φ Φ Φ = Φ Φ ΦU U P P         (10) 
where P= ⊥Φ Φ  and ( )j j j jP I  N=⊥ Τ −1 Τ− Φ Φ Φ Φ . Consider P⊥  is the orthogonal projection 
matrix for the CWI null space. U  denotes an M K×  random compressive matrix whose 
entries are derived from an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) distribution. The 
interference, if present, is totally cancelled out by projecting the received signal onto the 
interference null space. Then the received signal is again projected onto the desired signal 
subspace to reduce the noise effect. Thus, after (9) multiplies with (10), ˆ scy  is acquired.

2.2.2 Compressive sensing domain (CS-domain) 
 
The major concern is to remove the contribution of js  to the measurements ′y  while 
preserving the information about ds . Consider that js  can be regards as a sparse signal since 
it denotes a narrowband interference. The CS theory is adopted to estimate js  to subtract it 
from ′y . For a better CS estimate of js , the unknown data term must be eliminated in (8); or 
be treated as a noise, which will degrade the performance. The interference is nulled out by 
  
 
measurements. The test statistic for signal detection is defined by two hypothesis tests.

where Φ  denotes M N×  random measurement matrix with each entry taken from an i.i.d. 
random distribution. Without loss of generality, we assume that each entry of Φ  is assumed 
to obeys a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance 1 M/ . The satisfying 
statistic is as follows: 
T T( )−1Γ = ΦΦ Φy dy x           (18) 
 
The performance of the compressive detector can be approximated as:

Φ≈ − )σx P x         (19) 
where  T T= −1Φ Φ (ΦΦ ) ΦP . With regards to practical applications, the signal to be detected is 
unknown or has unknown parameters. In this way, a simple detector like a matched filter is 
not obtainable. The decision strategy is given by the generalized likelihood ratio test as 
follows (Kay, 1998; Ayoub et al., 2009):

hypothesis 1H  and 0H , respectively. a  denotes the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of 
a  under 1H .  In (20), η  is a threshold chosen to achieve a desired probability of false alarm. 
Hence, 1H  is chosen if > ηΛy , otherwise 0H  is chosen. If = y a , then the satisfying statistic

3. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
In this section, the performance of two proposed cancellation methods is evaluated in terms of 
its capability to acquire the desired signal dx  and cancel out the interference jx . The received 
signals are converted down to 1.25 MHz IF, and 1 ms data is adopted. The sampling 
frequency is 10 MHz, the code delay is 5000 sampling points, and the Doppler frequency shift 
is 0.1 KHz. In all simulations we define the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is defined as SNR 
= T /σ 2( )d dx x  and the total interference to noise ratio (INR) is set as INR = 
T /σ 2( )j jx x . 
  
3.1 Performance of Signal Detection  
  
For known signal length N = 5000  and signal sparsity K= 500 , the number of measurements 
for SubCS-domain is sM = N380 ≅ 0.76  and the number of measurements for CS-domain is 
cM = N= 0.5 2500 . For detection purposes, when the number of measurements is constrained 
by M < K , we only need to exploit the signal subspace where SNR is high. For SNR 
sufficiently low, an optimal M  should be less than K . A Gaussian random matrixes 
( sM K×∈U ^  and cM N×Φ ∈^ )  are generated for SubCS-domain detection and CS-domain 
detection, respectively. The narrowband interference is given by xj jΦ , where 
N J
j
×Φ ∈^ . 
Each entry of jΦ  and x j  is derived from an i.i.d. normal distribution. At SNR = 15 dB and 
total INR = 30 dB, the performance of the detectors for different fP  is illustrated in Figure 1 
where each simulation result is the average of 500 runs under different noise realizations. It 
demonstrates that the SubSC-domain detection with interference mitigation enhances the 
detection performance with fewer measurements by exploiting more signal information. In 
contrast with the case of no CWI, the performance loss for subspace compressive detection 
with CWI mitigation is very small. The SC-domain also can effectively eliminate the 
interference components. Nevertheless, its inefficiency of collecting the desired signal energy 
results in less probability of detection. In addition, the performance of these two methods is 
similar to that of FFT-based excisor (FDE) method (Chang et al., 2010).  
 
At 1fP = % , simulation results of the SubCS-domain detection method with varying SNR are 
presented in Figure 2. For a given dP , SubCS-domain detection on average have about 1~2 
dB performance gains in SNR over CS-domain detection. Moreover, the SubSC-domain and 
SC-domain detection have competitive performance in contrast to that yielded by the 
conventional detector (with FDE) which also requires Shannon sampling (Chang et al., 2010; 
Barket, 2005). Figure 3 depicts the signal acquisition result with and without the SubCS-
domain processing under interfered environment. Figure 4 illustrates the comparison of SNR 
improvement between the input SINR and post-SNR (Chang et al., 2010). In Fig. 4, it is 
shown that the SNR improvement curve in SubSC-domain method presents slightly better 
performance than other methods (Capozza et al., 2003; Iltis et al., 1985).
