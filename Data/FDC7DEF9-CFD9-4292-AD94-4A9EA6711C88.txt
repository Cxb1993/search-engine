Obviously, 0=x  is an equivalent point of system (2), 
i.e., the solution of system (2) is given by 0)( =tx  if 
( ) 00 =tx .  To avoid the trivial case of ( ) 00 =tx , in the 
following, we only consider the system (1) under the case 
of ( ) 00 ≠tx . 
 
Definition 1 [59]. 
Consider the system (2).  The closed and bounded 
manifold 0)( =xs , in the 21 xx −  plane, is said to be an 
exponentially stable limit cycle if there exist two positive 
numbers α  and β  such that the manifold of 0)( =xs  
along the trajectories of system (2) satisfies the following 
inequality  
( ) ( )[ ] .,exp)( 00 tttttxs ≥∀−−⋅≤ αβ  
In this case, the positive number α  is called the 
guaranteed convergence rate. 
   
 Now, we present the main result for the existence of 
limit cycles of system (1) as follows. 
Theorem 1 [59]. 
For the feedback bilinear systems (1), all of phase 
trajectories tend to the exponentially stable limit cycle

Proof of Theorem 1:  The proof can be obtained by the 
author. 
 
Remark 1.  Obviously, by Theorem 1, such bilinear 
feedback systems of (1) can be represented as nonlinear 
oscillators with the amplitude 
r
a  and the frequency b.  
Such oscillations are generally independent of the initial 
condition and limit cycles of such oscillation are not 
influenced by parameter variation.
