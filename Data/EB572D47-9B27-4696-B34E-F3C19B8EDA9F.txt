一、中文摘要 
累積計數和管制圖(簡稱 CCC 管制圖)常
用於監督高產出(接近零缺點)製程的產品不
合格率。傳統 CCC 管制圖作業係以產品生產
順序進行檢驗，並以檢測出一個不合格品的
累積總抽樣數作為監控變數。但在實際的生
產環境中，有些企業為了取得規模經濟或便
利性等優勢，經常以批量檢驗方式檢驗產
品。在此檢驗方式下，產品檢驗順序未必按
照產品生產順序進行。為符合上述生產環境
之實際需求，Zhang et al. (2008)以兩批不合格
樣本間的累積總抽樣數為監控變數，提出固
定檢驗批量的 CCC 管制圖。此作法對於製程
不格率明顯改變時的偵察能力極佳；但對於
製程不格率僅微幅改變時之偵察能力卻可能
明顯減弱。為改善此問題，本研究擬結合了
變動檢驗批量技術，提出另一新 CCC 管制圖
（稱為變動檢驗批量的 CCC 管制圖），並從
執行效率層面與成本觀點，針對超低不合格
率的製程，探索此一新管制圖的整體表現。
本研究已建立合適之績效指標，評估變動批
量管制圖運作上的效率性。此管制圖也將應
用於產業案例以展示其可行性，使本研究計
畫成果能更符合產業界之需求。

Abstract 
Cumulative count of conforming (CCC) 
chart has been shown effective for high-yield 
processes with very low fraction of 
nonconforming items. Traditional CCC chart 
assumes the products from a process are 
inspected item by item. Recently, the CCC 
chart was generalized to conform to the 
industrial practice where items are inspected 
sample by sample without according to the 
production order. Different from the traditional 
chart, the generalized CCC chart monitors the 
cumulative count of samples until a 
nonconforming sample is encountered. In order 
to improve the power of the generalized CCC 
chart to process change, this study applied the 
control scheme of variable sample size (VSS) 
to define an adaptive sample size CCC chart. 
The average time to signal (ATS) process 
change of the proposed chart was derived by 
Markov chain approach and taken as 
performance measure to evaluate its statistical 
4 
 In this study, we extend the variable 
sampling scheme to the generalized CCC chart. 
Note that in the CCC chart each time a sample 
is inspected one may not obtain a data point of 
the chart statistic as in the traditional 
Shewhart-type chart. Therefore, we assume 
sampling at fixed times and only discuss the 
generalized CCC chart with the VSS scheme by 
administrative considerations.  
三、變動批量之累積計數管制圖 
Consider a situation where products from a 
process are inspected sample by sample 
without according to the original ordering of 
production. We name a sample nonconforming 
if it contains one or more nonconforming items 
and conforming if it contains nonconforming 
items. 
 For the generalized CCC chart, the time 
between successively inspected samples is 
treated as the sampling interval (saying h ). 
The sample size, sampling interval length, and 
control limit are fixed without any change 
through the process. The generalized CCC 
chart can reduce to standard one if the sample 
size is 1, i.e., the case that items are inspected 
one by one in the order of production. 
 The VSS CCC chart (namely the VSSCCC  
chart) is a modification of the generalized CCC 
chart. Let 1n  and 2n  be the minimum and 
maximum sample sizes, respectively, such that 
21 nnn   while keeping the sampling 
interval fixed at h  for the administration 
consideration. The decision to switch between 
the maximum and minimum sample size 
depends on position of the prior sample point 
on the control chart. If the prior sample point 
falls in the safe region, the minimum sample 
size 1n  will be used for the current sample 
point; if the prior sample point falls in the 
warning region, the maximum sample size 2n  
will be used for the current sample point. 
Finally, if the prior sample point falls in the 
action region, then the process is considered 
out-of-control. 
四、績效指標 
 Operations of control charts can be 
regarded as a graphical expression of statistical 
testing for a process problem, thus the false 
alarm rate (i.e., the probability of type I error) 
and the speed with which it detects the 
occurrence of the process problem (i.e., the 
power of testing) are often used to evaluate the 
statistical performance of control charts. In the 
literature, average time to signal ( ATS) is the 
most commonly used measure to evaluate the 
statistical performance of different control 
charts when the lengths of time interval 
between two successive sample points are not 
fixed and equal for the compared charts. When 
the process is in-control, the larger the value for 
ATS the lower the false alarm rate; whereas 
when the process is out-of-control, the smaller 
the value for ATS, the quicker the speed it 
takes the chart to detect the increase in the 
fractional nonconforming.  
 Due to the memoryless property of the 
geometric distribution the ATS performance 
for the VSSCCC  chart were determined by the 
Markov chain approach (Ç inlar, 1975). 
At each sample point, one of the following 
states can be reached: State 1: sample point 
falls in safety region; State 2: sample point falls 
in warning region; State 3: sample point falls in 
action region. States 1 and 2 are transient states 
and State 3 is an absorbing state. 
 The transition probability matrix is given 
by 
6 
the sample sizes or by decreasing the false 
alarm rate.

Abstract. Using the CCC-chart with the variable sampling interval (VSI) scheme has been proposed 
recently to enhance the efficiency of monitoring a high-quality process by the traditional CCC-chart. This 
paper presents an economic model for designing the VSI CCC-chart. In the economic design, a cost function 
is constructed, involving the cost of sampling and testing, the cost of false alarms, the cost to detect and 
remove the assignable cause, and the cost when the process is operating out-of-control. A heuristic method of 
finding optimal values of adaptive design parameters for minimizing the cost function is also presented. The 
VSI and FSI CCC-charts are compared with respect to the expected loss per unit time. 
Keywords: CCC control charts, economic design, genetic algorithms, variable sampling interval.  
1. Introduction 
The control chart is a primary statistical process control tool to detect the occurrence of assignable 
causes so that a remedial action can be taken before a large number of defective products are manufactured 
in a process. The traditional approach to monitoring the defect rate in attribute data is to use a p-chart, which 
is based on the number of defects in a series of sampling intervals. However, with the rapid increase of 
automated technologies, it is possible for enterprises to pursue the goal of a high-quality process with almost 
zero defects. For such cases, it is better to use the cumulative conformance count (CCC) control chart, which 
is based on the time-between-defects [1]. 
The CCC-chart was first introduced by Calvin [2] and further developed by Goh [3]. The strategy of 
using 100% inspection is typically suggested for the implementation of the CCC-chart. However, 
considering practical factors such as the inspection time and cost, this strategy would lead to a cost for 
inspection and thus limit the application of CCC-charts. Instead of inspecting the items individually, Liu et al. 
[4] used sampling to reduce the inspection cost and time. They considered every individual item inspected as 
a sample (i.e., sample size is one), and called the time between two successive samples the sampling interval. 
In order to improve the detection speed of control charts for process changes, they further employed a 
variable sampling interval (VSI) scheme that allows an adaptive length of sampling interval, depending on 
the indication of last point on the chart. If the CCC statistic (i.e., time-between-defects) shows some 
indication of a process change, then the control is tightened by shortening the sampling interval. Otherwise, 
the control is loosened by lengthening the sampling interval. The results of the study showed that the 
efficiency of a CCC chart can be improved by using the VSI scheme without increasing the rate of inspected 
items and false alarm occurrences. However, they did not consider the economic aspect. Therefore, we 
extend Liu et al.’s work by presenting a methodology for designing the VSI CCC-chart based on the 
economic criterion. The rationale of VSI CCC-chart is first reviewed. Then an economic design for the VSI 
CCC-chart in accordance with Markov chain approach is presented. The optimal design parameters can be 
found through an optimization tool so that the cost function is minimized. An industrial example is used to 
provide numerical illustrations.

loosened/tightened control is defective, and X  falls into the action region; State 6: the process is out-of-
control and the item inspected with loosened control is conforming; State 7: the process is out-of-control and 
the item inspected with tightened control is conforming; State 8: the process is out-of-control, the item 
inspected with loosened/tightened control is defective, and X  falls into the safety region; State 9: the process 
is out-of-control, the item inspected with loosened/tightened control is defective, and X  falls into the 
warning region; When State 5 is reached, the signal the chart produces is a false alarm. If the item inspected 
is defective and X  falls into the action region when the process status is out-of-control, then the signal is a 
true alarm and the absorbing state, State 10, is reached. 
Accordingly, the transition probability matrix can be obtained. Then by the elementary properties of 
Markov Chains [5], 1)(' −− QIr  provides the mean number of transitions in each transient state before the true 
alarm signals, in which ),,,,,,,,( 987654321' rrrrrrrrrr =  is the vector of starting probability such that 1=∑ ir ; I  
is the identity matrix of order 9; and Q  is the transition matrix where the elements associated with the 
absorbing state have been deleted. The product of the average number of visiting the transient state and the 
corresponding sampling interval determines the period ATC . Thus, 
tQIrATC 1)(' −−=                                                                  (4) 
where t  is the vector of the sampling time intervals corresponding to the nine transient states for the next 
sampling. Here we set the vectors )0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0(' =r  and ),,,,,,,,( 212122121' hhhhhhhhht = . The fifth element 
in 't  placed by 2h  aims to provide an additional protection to prevent problems that arise during start-up. 
3. The cost model  
In developing the cost model of a process controlled by  the VSI CCC-chart, we make the following 
assumptions: (a). Process starts with an in-control state ( 0pp = ), but after a random time of in-control 
operation it will be disturbed by a single assignable cause that causes a change in the defect rate of the 
process ( 1pp = ); (b) After the change, the process remains out-of-control until the assignable cause is 
eliminated; (c) The inter-arrival time of the assignable cause disturbing the process is assumed to follow an 
exponential distribution with a mean of λ1  hours; (d) To detect the change in process defect rate, an item is 
inspected at each sampling time; the number of inspected samples until a defect occurs is recorded and 
plotted on the chart in sequence; (e) Before the number goes beyond the LCL, the length of subsequent 
sampling intervals will vary with their position on the chart. Otherwise, the process will be stopped and a 
search will start to find the assignable cause and adjust the process. 
The production cycle, which is divided into four time intervals of in-control period, out-of-control period, 
searching period due to false alarm, and the time period for identifying and correcting the assignable cause.  
Expected length of in-control period is λ1 . Expected length of out-of-control is the average time needed 
for the control chart to produce a signal after the change in process defect rate and is given by AATS . 
Let 0t  be the average amount of time wasted searching for the assignable cause when the process is in-
control, and )(FAE  be the expected number of false alarms per cycle given by 
fQIrFAE 1)(')( −−=                                                              (5) 
where )0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0(' =f . Then the expected length of searching period due to false alarm is given by 
)(0 FAEt . The time to identify and correct the assignable cause following an action signal is a constant 1t . 
Therefore, the expected length of a production cycle can be represented in aggregate as 
10 )()( tFAEtATCTE ++=                                                                (6) 
If one defines 0V = the hourly profit earned when the process is operating in control state; 1V = the hourly 
profit earned when the process is operating in out-of-control state; 0C = the average search cost if the given 
signal is false; 1C = the average cost to discover the assignable cause and adjust the process to in-control state; 
s = the cost for each inspected item. Then the expected net profit from a production cycle is given by 
)()()1()1()( 1010 NsECFAECMVVCE −−−−+= λλ                                          (7) 
where )(NE  is the average number of inspected items during a production cycle, as given by 
η1)(')( −−= QIrNE                                                                 (8)

5.2. Improvements 
Due to the low speed with which the standard CCC chart detects a process change, the process engineer 
now monitors the process by adding a VSI feature to the CCC chart. In the economic design of the VSI 
CCC-chart, the minimum value of sampling intervals are considered as the possible minimum time between 
successive samples available in a work shift, i.e., 01.02 ≥h . Furthermore, as Liu et al. [4] recommended, the 
performance of the VSI CCC-chart can be improved significantly when adopting equal probability allocation 
for the safety and warning region, i.e., )LCL|WLPr()LCL|WLLCLPr( >>=>≤< XXXX . 
Consequently, we consider only the above situation in this study for the sake of convenience. 
Tables I and II show the optimal design parameters and corresponding performances for the VSI CCC-
chart as well as the FSI CCC-chart. The cost function )(LE  for the VSI scheme arrives at minimum of 
16.799 if the optimal parameters for the VSI scheme are set by 1=n , 1h =0.120, 2h =0.080, WL =1571, and 
LCL =186. If the percent reduction (%) in )(LE  is defined as the  
100)())()(( ×− FSIVSIFSI LELELE                                                  (10) 
The saving of per hour operation is about 1.63%. Although economic property is slightly better, the VSI 
scheme has substantially better statistical properties (out-of-control AATS =1.599 and )(FAE =0.011) than the 
FSI scheme. 
6. Conclusions 
This paper has presented an economic design for the VSI CCC-chart used to monitor the defect rate of a 
high-quality process. The cost function developed here can be used to evaluate the economic performance of 
the VSI CCC-chart. The assumption that the assignable cause occurs according to an exponential distribution 
allows the cost function to be obtained by means of the Markov chain approach. An industrial example for 
illustrating the application of the economic model is provided, and the genetic algorithm is employed to 
search for the solution of economic design.
