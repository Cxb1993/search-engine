computer-based diagnostic systems for osteoporosis has 
two limitations. First, some of the patient’s clinical signs 
(such as results of BMD tests [13], [16], or other 
invasive and laboratory measurements [12]-[16]) on 
which the systems rely for deducing diagnostic 
conclusions are difficult to be acquired outside hospitals 
or laboratory environments. As mentioned above, this 
not only decreases the accessibility of the systems to the 
general public, but also increases the cost of diagnosing 
osteoporosis such that mass screening using such 
systems is practically infeasible. Second, during 
construction process, some of the systems need a great 
amount of consultation with medical experts [16], [17]. 
This involves the acquisition of diagnostic knowledge 
from experts. In many medical domains, however, this 
knowledge may be incomplete, since the relationship 
between clinical signs and medical meanings are not 
always transparent — osteoporosis diagnosis is exactly 
the case.  
To overcome the drawbacks mentioned above, in this 
paper, we propose a novel learning-driven system — 
Intelligent Medical Diagnostic System (IMDS) 
accessible through web interface — for performing 
on-line initial screening for osteoporosis. The 
fundamentals of the IMDS are mainly based on the 
well-known theory of fuzzy-neural networks (FNNs). 
FNNs possess the ability to automatically learn useful 
knowledge from available examples without the active 
participation of domain experts during the process of 
constructing system, and can exhibit superiority over 
other conventional technologies (e.g. statistical 
techniques and regression analyses) due to its superior 
nonlinear modeling capability. Through the internet, 
users simply answer a series of directed questions to the 
IMDS, and then they will immediately receive the 
results of osteoporosis risk assessment. According to the 
results of clinical testing, it is shown that the proposed 
system does provide the general public or even health 
care providers with a convenient, reliable alternative to 
the assessment of BMD and to the risk assessment of 
osteoporosis.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II introduces a new four-layered FNN and then 
explains its role in medical diagnosis. The architecture 
of the IMDS and the proposed learning algorithm are 
described in Section III. In Section IV, we use a BMD 
database to construct the IMDS, and then evaluate its 
performance in osteoporosis risk assessment. Finally, 
Section V concludes the paper. 
II. FUZZY-NEURAL NETWORK 
A diagnostic process can be formalized by evaluating 
available clinical signs (information drawn from the 
patient’s history and from clinical and laboratory 
findings) and then deducing appropriate conclusions 
according to a set of diagnostic rules which describe the 
relationship between signs and diseases [16]. Diagnosis 
work can essentially be regarded as a classification task; 
in other words, a diagnostic system is practically 
equivalent to a classifier.  
It is well known that FNNs possess the ability to 
automatically acquire useful knowledge from a large 
number of examples, and can exhibit superior nonlinear 
modeling capability in many fields such as pattern 
classification, object recognition, model prediction, and 
system identification. A FNN is named by the fact that a 
fuzzy model described by if-then rules and inference 
mechanisms can completely be transformed into a 
multi- layered artificial neural network (MNN) 
composed of neurons and connecting links as long as 
each neuron in a MNN performs a corresponding 
function in a fuzzy model, for example, fuzzification, 
intersection, union, and defuzzification. This fact makes 
standard gradient learning methods in MNNs available 
to adjust the parameters of FNNs [18], [19], and further 
facilitates the design of learning algorithms for FNNs. 
In this paper, therefore, we employ a FNN classifier as 
the kernel of the IMDS to perform the diagnosis works.  
It is worth noting that differing from conventional 
complicated five-layered FNNs, a new four-layered one 
is proposed here so that we can construct a diagnostic 
system with the properties of lower complexity and 
easier implementation. As shown in Fig. 1, the proposed 
FNN consists of the following four layers in sequential 
order: an input layer, a fuzzification layer, a rule layer, 
and a class layer. This architecture can completely 
represent a Mamdani-like fuzzy model which is 
described as the following rules: 
Rule j:  If  
1x  is 
( )
1
jA  and … and Nx  is 
( )j
NA           (1) 
then  the input x belongs to class i. 
where j is a rule index, N denotes the number of input 
features,  Ak( j) represents the fuzzy set (linguistic term) 
in kth subpremise of rule j, x = [x1, x2,…, xN] indicates the 
set of all input features, and i is a class label which is a 
crisp index rather than a fuzzy set. Adopting such a 
model has two main merits. On one hand, we can 
interpret the fuzzy model by means of natural language. 
This not only provides us some insights into the 
working of the diagnostic system, but can also facilitate 
the adaptation of design parameters and operating 
conditions of the system. On the other hand, since the 
consequent part of each if-then rule only contains a crisp 
class label, we do not require a complicated 
defuzzification method (such as center of gravity, or 
mean of maximum commonly used in Mamdani fuzzy 
models) to derive a crisp output for the result of fuzzy 
inference. Instead, we use the simplest winner-takes-all 
method to get the crisp output of the model. This merit 
largely simplifies the derivation of parameter learning 
algorithm as well as reducing the complexity of the 
model. Considering Fig. 1, we subsequently explain in 
more detail how the proposed FNN can implement the 
Mamdani-like fuzzy rules and inference. 
A. Representation of Fuzzy Rule  
The input layer consists of input neurons k, k 
=1,2,…,N, each of which is respectively associated with 
 4
commonly used in conventional FNNs, we ignore them 
in the proposed FNN; instead, we regard the class with 
the highest fulfillment degree as the most probable class 
to make a crisp interpretation for the diagnostic results. 
III. INTELLIGENT MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM 
The IMDS system is mainly comprised of three parts: 
a learning module, a knowledge base, and a web-based 
user interface. The architecture of the system is shown 
in Fig. 2. The objective of the learning module is to 
construct a FNN classifier not only with high 
classification accuracy but also with good 
interpretability. This objective is accomplished by 
means of a series of learning algorithms including 
k-means clustering, gradient descent parameter tuning, 
and similarity-based model simplification. The 
knowledge base is practically a FNN classifier. It 
consists of a fuzzy inference engine and a fuzzy medical 
rule database. The former performs fuzzy inference with 
respect to the presented input feature vectors so as to 
provide reasonable diagnostic results; the latter contains 
a collection of diagnostic rules acquired from available 
medical databases which store a great amount of data 
relating to patient’s records or medical history. The 
web-based user interface provides users with a 
convenience path to access the service offered by the 
IMDS. Through this interface, users can submit their 
personal information and receive the related diagnoses 
in an easy manner. As the principles underlying the 
proposed FNN have been discussed in the previous 
section, we only introduce the other two parts in the 
following subsections. 
A. Initial Rule Learning Algorithm 
We apply the K-means clustering algorithm, which is 
one of the simplest algorithms in the field of pattern 
recognition, to acquire representative information from 
the given patient’s records or medical history. Each of 
the obtained clusters stands for a prototype for a 
particular behavior of the medical knowledge under 
consideration; that is, each cluster can be used to define 
a diagnostic rule. Moreover, directly projecting each 
cluster onto individual inputs can obtain initial 
membership functions for each rule [19]. Fig. 3 depicts 
the flowchart of the initial rule learning algorithm.

B. Parameter Learning Algorithm 
The parameter learning algorithm is developed based 
on the well-known gradient descent method. According 
to our previous works [22], the algorithm is summarized 
as follows. Let di be the desired class index, ei = di − aci 
indicate the class error, and learning rate η > 0. The 
parameter vector θkfk = [akfk, bkfk, ckfk]T of the membership 
function µkfk can be updated by the well-known delta 
learning rule:

Considering Eq. (6), we can find that in each time

calcium or vitamin D intake, 17) seldom drinking milk 
and eating dairy foods, 18) low calcium intake in 
childhood, and 19) lack of regular exercise. These 
features represent 19 risk factors of osteoporosis.  
The standard of osteoporosis is defined by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) in terms of BMD measured 
by DEXA scanning [1], [3]. The result of a BMD test is 
represented as a T-score derived by comparing one’s 
BMD to that of young normal mean value. A T-score 
greater than or equal to 1−  is in the normal range. A 
score between 1−  and 2.5−  is considered osteopenia, 
and any score lower than 2.5−  is regarded as 
osteoporosis. According to this standard, we divide the 
245 cases into three classes. Each case belongs to one of 
the three classes; as a result, normal has 66 cases, 
osteopenia has 106 cases, and osteoporosis has 73 cases. 
Moreover, since the 19 features contain both numeric 
and nominal variables, we need to preprocess them so 
that the proposed algorithms can successfully perform. 
First, since the first three features respectively represent 
three individual numeric variables, we normalize their 
values into [0, 1] interval. Second, as the last 16 features 
are nominal variables, we define each positive answer as 
1, and each negative answer as 0.  
The proposed algorithms are applied to automatically 
construct a FNN classifier from the BMD dataset. We 
designate the number of clusters as three so as to acquire 
three initial diagnostic rules, each of which respectively 
describes a single BMD class. After 300 iterations for 
parameter learning, the resultant FNN classifier 
generates 52 misclassifications (74% correct) on 200 
training cases, and 14 misclassifications (69% correct) 
on 45 testing cases. This leads to a recognition rate of 
73% (66 misclassifications) on the total data set. The 
obtained membership functions are shown in Fig. 6. 
Note here that the blue graphs indicate the antecedent 
membership functions of the rule describing normal 
situation, green graphs denote the membership 
functions of the rule describing osteopenia, and red 
graphs indicate the membership functions of the rule 
describing osteoporosis.  
Due to heavy overlap between fuzzy sets in Fig. 6, 
however, it is obviously difficult to assign an 
appropriate linguistic term to each fuzzy set. We further 
utilize the model simplification algorithm to enhance 
the interpretability of the fuzzy sets. After model 
simplification, the classifier generates 58 
misclassifications (71% correct) on 200 training cases, 
and 15 misclassifications (66.7% correct) on 45 testing 
cases. This leads to a recognition rate of 70.2% (73 
misclassifications) on the total data set. Fig. 7 shows the 
simplified fuzzy sets. Although the classification 
accuracy decreases about 4%, it is evident that the latter 
has much better interpretability than the former. 
Considering both accuracy and interpretability, we 
employ the simplified FNN as the kernel of the IMDS.

Finally, we gather additional 10 cases for clinical 
testing, among which normal has two cases, osteopenia 
has five cases, and osteoporosis has three cases. After 
presenting all the cases into the IMDS, the system 
generates only two misclassifications (80% correct). 
Figs. 8 and 9 show one of the cases and its results of risk 
assessment, respectively. Given the T-score of this case 
is 2.9− , as shown in Fig. 9, the IMDS evidently 
provides correct results of osteoporosis risk assessment.
