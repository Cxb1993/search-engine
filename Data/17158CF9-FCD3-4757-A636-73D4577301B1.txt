Abstract: We have proposed and demonstrated a multi-wavelength-switchable and uniform
erbium-doped fiber laser using unbalanced in-line Sagnac Interferometer. By employing this
simple scheme and through the proper control of the polarization controller, we were able to
achieve uniform multi-wavelength operation of up to 84 laser lines with the signal-to-noise
ratio over 20dB and 0.8-nm wavelength switching at room temperature. Again, we generated
more than 300 lines and good power stability (≦0.2dB) over 1570nm-1610nm in the
experiment.
1. Introduction
The multi-wavelength-switchable fiber laser sources have not only been seriously considered for
application in optical remote sensing and Dense Wavelength-Division Multiplexing transmission
(DWDM) systems, but have also been used as a test instrument for optical components.
Multi-wavelength fiber lasers using EDFs have been widely investigated due to unique
advantages such as high saturation power and large gain. However, there are different approaches
to achieving multi-wavelength generation with various gain mechanisms including
semiconductor optical amplification (SOA) [1-4], erbium-doped fiber (EDF) [5, 6], hybrid SOA
and EDF [7], Brillouin-erbium fiber [8, 9], as well as Raman and EDF [10].
Up to now, 160 Brillouin Stokes lines [9] and uniform multi-wavelength fiber based on
hybrid Raman and EDF gains [10] have been reported. Recently, we presented a
multi-wavelength-switchable and uniform erbium-doped fiber laser using unbalanced in-line
Sagnac Interferometer. It was designed to provide uniform multi-wavelength operation of up to
84 laser lines with a signal-to-noise ratio over 20dB and 0.8-nm wavelength switching. Again we
can achieve the generation of more than 300 lines and good power stability over 1570nm-1610nm
at≦0.2dB.
2. Experiments and Discussions
The experimental schematic for the proposed multi-wavelength-switchable and uniform
erbium-doped fiber laser based on unbalanced in-line Sagnac Interferometer with
polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF) is shown in Fig.1. Two pieces of erbium-doped fiber, EDF1
and EDF2 were the gain medium, and one 1×2 optical coupler was used to generate the L-band
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) light source. The EDF1 and EDF2 with 20m and 2m were
forward pumped through WDM1 and WDM2 combining 980nm and 1580nm with 0.5dB
worst spectral performance. Therefore, we carried out the following experiments based on the
45-degree spliced angle.
Fig.2 Experimental results of the proposed multi-wavelength-switchable fiber laser for 1m
PMF spliced at different spliced angle. (a) Output spectra at 0- (black), 15- (red) and
30-degree (green) spliced angle; (b) Output spectra at 45- (pink), 60- (purple) and
90-degree (yellow) spliced angle.
Next, we measured the output spectra for 1m, 3m, 6m and 12m PMF as shown in Fig.3. By
carefully adjusting PC, the red solid spectra in Fig. 3(a) can be shifted to the blue dotted line as
well as the other cases. We also found that 19 generated laser lines in Fig. 3(a) can increase to 84,
166 and 318 lines as shown in Fig. 3(b), (c) and (d) by extending the PMF from 3m to 12m.

Fig.5 Repeated scanning spectra for 1m, 3m, 6m and 12m PMF in 45 minutes.
Moreover, we also measured power stability for four cases shown in Fig.6 (a-d), where the data
were taken 4 times in a 3-minute period. Power stability during 3-minute measurement changes
less than 0.2dB over the whole waveband.
Fig.6 Measured fluctuations of each peak power over 1570-1610nm for the different length of
PMF within 3 minutes.
From the results as summarized in Table 1, it is obvious that such design can provide the
multi-wavelength generation so that the channel spacing in each waveband is
0.8nm/0.4nm/0.2nm (100GHz/50GHz/25GHz at 1550nm, i.e. WDM ITU-grid). Compared with
the previous works [9, 10], we not only achieved more generated laser lines but also provided
more power stability and uniformity. Therefore, unbalanced in-line Sagnac Interferometer
incorporating PMF can be used to achieve multi-wavelength generation and uniform power
spectra with good power stability.
