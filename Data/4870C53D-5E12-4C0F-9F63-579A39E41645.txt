Abstract21
Novel zeolite SBA-15/carbon nanocomposite membrane using polyetherimide (PEI)22
as precursor were successfully prepared by spin coating method for gas transport.23
Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and field emission scanning electron microscopy24
(FESEM) were employed to characterize the nanocomposite membrane structure25
properties. In single gas permeation experiments, the zeolite SBA-15/carbon26
nanocomposite membrane exhibited excellent carbon dioxide permeance of 49.327
Barrer with ideal separation factor of CO2/N2 of 27.4 at room temperature and 2 atm.28
Based on TGA and FESEM investigations, the membranes appear more microporous29
structure while incorporated with SBA-15 zeolite. These results supported that zeolite30
improve gas diffusivity by increasing the micropore volume.31

Keywords: carbon membrane; gas separation; polyimide; zeolite; carbonization33
co-vinyl chloride (PVP) [24]. In general, polymeric membrane preparation conditions,53
pre-treatment of the precursor, pyrolysis conditions, and post-treatment of pyrolysed54
membranes are all play important roles on membrane’s pore structure and 55
consequently results in different gas transport properties.56
Though great progress has been made in the field of carbon membranes, it is not57
uncommon that a strong trade-off relationship exists between the permeability and58
selectivity, i.e. the permeation flux through the carbon membranes is considerably59
reduced as the gas selectivity increases because of the disordered pore structure and60
diffusion resistance membranes. To tackle this challenging issue, almost all the efforts61
to control micropores in carbon membrane have been directed toward the production62
of miroporous molecular sieving carbon (MSC), or synthesis of composite membranes63
by incorporating some nano-scaled materials such as Ag-nanocluster [9], palladium64
nano-particles [25], zeolite [26-28], metal oxides [29], carbon nanotubes [30-31] and65
silica [10,32-33], but it is still far from satisfactory.66
To solve this challenging task, here we proposed a simple strategy to incorporate67
zeolite into the membranes that could significantly improve the gas flux without68
losing the selectivity of membranes. As a mesoporous zeolite, SBA-15 has a lot of69
particular characteristics, such as large surface area, narrow pore distribution, long70
vigorous stirring at 313 K for 3 h until a clear solution was formed. TEOS90
(tetraethylorthosilicate, 98%, Merck) was added to the solution under stirring. After91
0.5 h, the gel was formed and the stirring was continued at 373 K for 24 h, cooled92
down to room temperature and filtered under vacuum. It was washed by deionised93
water three times and was calcined at 773 K for 6 h in air (at a heating rate of 294
K/min). Fig. 1 represents the porous structure and surface image of zeolite. The95
results of TEM and SEM measurements confirm that the highly ordered mesostructure96
of SBA-15 can be obtained.97
The second step is to prepare the incorporated matrix coating suspension. The98
coating suspension was prepared by dispersing some zeolite with a media particle size99
of 1-2 µm into 15 % n-methyl-2-pyrolidone (NMP) solution of PEI. Generally, about100
0.2-0.4 g of zeolite particles were used in the 100 ml solution. To disperse the zeolite101
homogeneously in the solution, a high-intensity ultrasonic processor was used to102
sonicate the coating suspension for about 30 min. This sonication step provided103
powerful shearing of the zeolite particles breaking up aggregates of particles and104
enhancing homogeneity during the intense agitation. After sonication, the coating105
suspension was allowed to stand for about 6 h to let larger zeolite particles settle to106
the bottom of a vial.107
The microstructure images of zeolite XAB-15 were recorded with transmission126
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The images were recorded using a JEOL127
JSF-2000FX transmission electron microscopy (JEOL, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) at an128
excitation voltage of 200 kV.129
The thermal stability, i.e. carbon yield, defined as the weight relative to the initial130
precursor weight, was evaluated by TGA. The TGA experiments were carried out131
using a Seiko SSC 5000 with a nitrogen atmosphere and flow rates of 50 ml/min. The132
heating was 10 oC/min, and the sample was heated to 700 oC.133
The distribution of zeolite in the SBA-15/CMS composite membrane was134
investigated with field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The SEM135
was used to look at both the cross-section and surface of the membranes. The136
micrographs were obtained using a JEOL JSM-6700F, OXFORD INCA ENERGY137
400 for magnifications up to 50,000 ratios.138

2.3. Permeation test140
141
To analyze the permeation characteristics of the membrane, different gases were142
selected: CO2 (3.3 Å), O2 (3.46 Å), and N2 (3.64 Å). The values in brackets143
correspond to the kinetic diameter of each gas. The gas permeation properties of the144
being 273 K, and T the measured temperature (K). In the case of pure penetrant gas,164
the ideal separation factor of pure gas A/B (αA/B) is defined as the ratio of permeation165
rate of A to that of B, which can be expressed by:166
αA/B =PA/PB (2)167
The apparent diffusion coefficient, D, is determined from the time-lag,, as expressed168
by:169
D=L2/6 (3)170
The apparent solubility coefficient, S, is evaluated as S = P/D.171

3. Results and discussion173
174
3.1. Thermal stability of the CMS membrane175
176
The typical TGA profiles for the original PEI precursor, pure PEI polymeric177
membrane and composite SBA-15/PEI polymeric membrane were shown in Fig. 3.178
The pure PEI precursor shows three obvious thermal degradation stages. The first179
thermal degradation stages starts from the temperature of 25-450 oC with the weight180
loss ca. 4.5 wt% that is attributed to the minor thermal degradation of branch groups181
in PEI molecular chains. The second weight loss stage is between 450-540 oC, which182
matrix (see next paragraph). As the result, the gas permeability of SBA-15 composite201
CMS membrane would be improved.202
203
3.2. Microstructures of the CMS membrane204
205
Fig. 4 shows the photographs of pure PEI-based CMS membrane and206
SBA-15/CMS composite membrane. From the FESEM images (Fig. 4 (a)),207
continuous CMS membrane were formed on the macroporous support by one time208
spin coating method. The thickness of the CMS membrane was about 2 μm, and the209
surface of CMS membrane exhibits a very smooth being almost dense structure (Fig.210
4 (b)). Compared to the pure CMS membrane, interestingly, the SBA-15/CMS211
membrane shows large amount of micropores in the surface structure (Fig. 4(c)) after212
pyrolysis at the same condition. The result suggests that the dispersion of zeolite213
SBA-15 particle in the polymer precursor may result in catalytic degradation effect of214
the SBA-A5 particles on pyrolysis stages and acceleration the rate of decomposition215
the PEI structure. Also seen from the FESEM image of SBA-15/CMS composite216
membrane (Fig. 4(d)), the white spots are SBA-15 zeolite particle that are dispersed in217
the carbon matrix. The enchased SBA-15 zeolite would provide two functions to218
improve the gas permeability of the composite carbon membrane: one is providing219
attributed to the reduction of gas transport resistance through membranes by providing239
additionally microporous channels in SBA-15 and interfacial resistance [37-38].240
Furthermore, the gas selectivity of these membranes was not losing after241
incorporating SBA-15 into the membrane. As can be seen from previous FESEM242
images and XRD patterns, the final carbon structure form more porous or less243
compact structures in the carbon matrix might be responsible for higher gas244
permeability without losing selectivity in the SBA-15/CMS membrane.245
The gas permeability of SBA-15/CMS composite membrane also follows an246
order of CO2 > O2 > N2, which is correlated with their kinetic diameter (CO2 (0.33247
nm), O2 (0.346 nm), and N2 (0.364 nm)) instead of the molecular weight of gas248
molecules. The higher selectivity than those expected from Knudsen diffusion are249
achieved confirms that the gas permeation through the composite carbon membranes250
obeys molecular sieving mechanism and some pores of the prepared carbon251
membrane are of molecular dimensions. The SBA-15 zeolite size is likely to affect252
both the pore size distribution and the micropore volume (selectivity and253
permeability).254
Further information regarding the gas transport properties of the SBA-15/CMS255
membrane was obtained by carrying out permeation experiments with different feed256
pressure. The pressure dependence on gas permeability through PEI-based CMS257
The higher diffusion selectivity of molecular sieving media is based primarily on the277
ability to limit rotational degrees of freedom of bigger gas molecular in the diffusion278
transition state while allowing free rotation for the smaller one [39]. SBA-15 zeolite279
accomplishes this by the presence of constricted windows to perform precise size280
selection of penetrants.281
282
4. Conclusions283
284
In the present work, we have shown that SBA-15 zeolite is a good tailor for285
modification the pore structure of carbon membrane, which results a286
high-performance membrane for improved gas separation. The selective287
SBA-15/carbon domain presents a structure with pores of molecular dimension and288
provides an interface improved the interacting between gas molecular and passageway.289
Finally, we can say that using SBA-15 zeolite as modifier having a uniform porous290
structure and silica composition provides an additional clue to improve CO2 gas291
permeability by sorption mechanism, while O2 gas permeability by diffusion292
mechanism.293
