晶鑽石薄膜，但硼分佈不均勻，會在鑽石晶粒間偏析， 影響元件特性【19】。（4）在開發N-型
多晶鑽石薄膜時，面臨困難，一直沒有重大發展。（5）多晶鑽石薄膜的電子缺陷特別多，影響
電子傳輸速度【20】。基於上述多種原因，在1990年代末期有關多晶鑽石電子元件的研究銳減。
近年來由於奈米多晶鑽石薄膜以及鑽石奈米結構技術的發展，鑽石的電性應用有兩個走向：  
 
一、 奈米多晶鑽石薄膜的場發射電極以及電子元件研發。【21-25】  
奈米多晶鑽石的優勢有兩項：（1）奈米多晶鑽石薄膜，雖有晶粒邊界（grain boundary），
但其電性比一般的多晶鑽石薄膜好。（2）奈米多晶鑽石薄膜是在矽基板上製備的，成本比
同質磊晶鑽石薄膜便宜。 
 
二、 鑽石奈米結構的製作技術及場發射電極研發。【26-35】  
 
鑽石奈米結構的製作技術，主要應用是當作場發射的電極（field emitter），一個優良的
場發射電極，需具備下列條件：一、有尖狀結構，因尖端有較大電場強度，有助於降低起始
電壓，增強場發射電流密度；二、有良好導電度，因載子濃度（carrier concentration）高，
有助增加場發射電流密度。因此鑽石奈米結構的製作技術，集中在製作尖狀結構的技巧，由
發表文獻的成功案例來看，有兩個方式可製備奈米大小的鑽石尖狀結構：  
（1） 用電漿蝕刻法。  
2000年，E. S. Baik 和 Y. J. Baik提出使用空氣電漿（air plasma），可蝕刻多晶鑽
石薄膜，製作奈米直徑大小的鑽石尖狀結構，但鑽石尖狀結構呈不規則排列，無法控
制鑽石尖狀結構在基板的位置。【26】2002年，S. Okuyama等人利用SiO2顆粒當作阻
擋罩（mask），在氧電漿中，蝕刻多晶鑽石薄膜，製作出緊密的鑽石柱狀結構。【27】
往後幾年的發展，H2電漿以及CF4/O2電漿也被用來製作的鑽石奈米結構，要注意的是，
不同的電漿製程，製備的鑽石奈米結構呈不同形狀，有圓錐狀、有尖狀。【28,29】2006
年K. Subramanian等人利用CH4/H2/N2電漿，製備為場發射設計的微米級的鑽石陣列，
每個微米大小的鑽石上都有奈米大小的尖狀結構，大大提升場發射性能。【30】  
（2） 用電漿化學氣相沉積法。  
2002年 H. Masuda等人成功的在有奈米孔洞陣列的氧化鋁基版上，製作奈米鑽石柱
狀結構陣列。【31, 32】過去幾年來，本計畫主持人也與清大物理系寇崇善教授合作，
投入鑽石的尖狀結構製程技術研發，2004年我們發表在CH4/H2電漿中，成長奈米鑽石管
狀結構，並以電子繞射證實奈米鑽石管狀結構是單晶。隔一年，也以不同的電漿製程，
製備實心的鑽石尖狀結構，此鑽石奈米結構也是單晶。【33,34】2007年我們發現，奈
米鑽石尖狀結構的導電度不佳，場發射的起始電壓高，場發射電流密度小，若將奈米鑽
石尖狀結構，再浸入電漿轟擊幾分鐘，鑽石的場發射特性大大提升，可與奈米碳管的場
發射特性相似。【35】  
  
本計畫主持人在研發鑽石的尖狀結構製程中，發現可將鑽石的尖狀結構的研究導向奈米電
子元件研發，主要的原因是鑽石尖狀結構都是單晶，此可大大改善1990 年代使用多晶鑽石薄膜
製作電子元件所碰到的缺點。使用奈米大小的單晶鑽石，應可研發「奈米鑽石電子元件及其製
程」。

B. 柱狀鑽石蕭基二極體製程技術  
將Boron doped 多晶鑽石膜表面都經過酒精清潔之後，隨即利用13.54 MHz的射頻電源供應器
在100W的功率下產生氧氣電漿來進行蝕刻，設定通入氧氣的流量為60sccm將工作壓力控制於10 
mtorr。蝕刻後的鑽石膜表面形貌是使用JEOL-JSM-6500F掃瞄式電子顯微鏡 (FESEM)來進行觀測。
而後將蝕刻後的鑽石膜沉浸於90度C的高濃度硝酸溶液中20分鐘來清除鑽石棒表面可能存在的非
晶碳。接下來將硝酸處理過後的鑽石膜沉浸於90度C高濃度的鹽酸溶液中20分鐘來清除鑽石棒表
面因電漿蝕刻濺鍍上來的鐵元素。因為要量測蕭基二極體元件特性，我們先在矽基板上面長一層
500nm的氧化層，並在其上利用黃光微影技術定義出絕緣的下電極AlN，之後在光學顯微鏡下，
利用玻璃針將鑽石棒挑起，並將鑽石棒置於已定義的下電極上。接下來利用黃光微影定義出歐姆
電極，利用熱蒸鍍機蒸鍍一層約20nm厚的鈦金屬和200nm厚的鋁金屬，並在600度C下退火30分鐘，
接下來將試片放置於氫氣電漿下20分鐘，使鑽石棒表面氫化。氫氣電漿處理完之後，再利用黃光
微影定義出蕭基電極，再蒸鍍一層約200nm厚的金屬，對於Boron doped鑽石棒所使用的蕭基金屬
電極為鋁。量測電性使用的儀器是Agilent 4155C。

Nanotechnology 22 (2011) 205707 J-Y Lin et al
polycrystalline diamond films have been attractive for elec-
tronic applications in the past decades due to the reduction
of production costs by using silicon wafers as the substrates.
However, the grain boundaries in the polycrystalline diamond
films degrade the device performance [12, 13]. This makes
the polycrystalline diamond film less attractive for commercial
device applications.
One method to preserve the merits of single crystalline
diamond and low production cost is to extract single crystalline
diamond from a grain within the polycrystalline diamond film.
In this paper, we report the fabrication of an Al/diamond
Schottky diode on a single crystalline diamond rod (SCDR)
of submicron diameter extracted from a grain. The electrical
characteristics of the Al/diamond Schottky diode fabricated on
the SCDR are discussed.
2. Experimental details
The fabrication sequence of the Al/diamond Schottky diode on
a SCDR is illustrated in figure 1. A boron doped polished
polycrystalline diamond/Si substrate of 20 μm thick was
cleansed and then put on a steel holder of 4 inch in diameter
in a capacitively coupled radio frequency chemical vapor
deposition (RFCVD) chamber. A forest of diamond rods
was fabricated on the substrate by oxygen plasma etching,
similar to the etching procedures in previously published
papers [14–16]. The RF power was set at 100 W and the flow
rate of oxygen was kept at 60 sccm. The working pressure
of oxygen plasma was ∼10−2 Torr and the self-bias voltage on
the sample was measured to be −997 V during plasma etching.
The self-bias voltage might be changed by tuning the radio
frequency power. Vertically aligned SCDRs became shorter
if the self-bias voltage was smaller. The substrate temperature
was raised to approximately 260 ◦C at the end of each run due
to the ion bombardment. SCDRs were fabricated by etching
in oxygen plasma for 12 h. The diamond substrate was then
cleaned in HCl and HNO3 to remove Fe2O3 and amorphous
carbon. The morphologies of the as-etched diamond substrates
were characterized by using a JEOL JSE-6500F field emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Some as-etched
SCDRs were scratched off the substrate and the as-scratched
SCDRs were characterized by electron diffraction using a JEM
3000F transmission electron microscope (TEM). Insulating
pads of AlN were deposited onto the SiO2(500 nm)/Si
substrates and patterned by photolithography. One scratched
SCDR was picked up and put across the patterned AlN pads
using a glass tip with the assistance of an optical microscope.
The scratched SCDR was kept above the SiO2 layer by the
patterned AlN pads in order to avoid the current transport
across the diamond/SiO2 interface in the operation of the
Schottky diode. The patterned AlN pads also defined the
position of the scratched SCDR that was important for further
deposition of metal electrodes in the fabrication process of
the Al/diamond Schottky diode. Al(200 nm)/Ti(20 nm) were
deposited onto one end of the scratched SCDR. A rapid thermal
anneal at 600 ◦C for 30 min in N2 ambient was required in order
to form a good Al/Ti/diamond ohmic contact. The sample was
then put in H2 plasma for 20 min to hydrogenate the diamond
Figure 1. Schematic diagram showing the fabrication sequence of
the Al/diamond Schottky diode on a single crystalline diamond rod
(SCDR). The fabrication sequence is polishing, oxygen plasma
etching, placing the as-scratched SCDR on AlN, forming the

contact.
surface followed by the deposition of Al for the formation of
the Al/diamond Schottky contact. The current–voltage (I –V )
characteristics of each Schottky diamond diode were taken by
using an Agilent 4155.
3. Results and discussion
Before fabrication of SCDRs, the carrier concentration of
the polished boron doped polycrystalline diamond film was
determined to be ∼1020 cm−3 by the Hall measurement.
The high carrier concentration (∼1020 cm−3) is attributed
to the surface conductive layer of a hydrogenated diamond
film. In 1992, Mori et al reported that the diamond film
deposited in a H2/CO mixed plasma exhibited relatively low
resistance in the range of 106–107  when the diamond
film was cooled in vacuum [17]. It is known that a

diode fabricated on an hydrogenated SCDR.
Al/diamond Schottky contacts fabricated on the as-scratched
and the hydrogenated SCDR. The Al/diamond contact exhibits
Schottky characteristics for the SCDR without hydrogenation.
The current density is 316 A cm−2 at a forward bias (VF)
voltage of −3 V. The hydrogen plasma treatment greatly
increases the current density to 1.4×104 A cm−2 at −3 V. The
forward current density is much higher than that reported for
the Schottky diode fabricated on homoepitaxial diamond film
mentioned earlier. The forward I –V characteristics at room
temperature in figure 5 are used to extract the ideality factor
and Schottky barrier height through the thermionic emission
equation
I = A∗ AT 2 exp(−eφb/kT ) exp(eV/nK T )
where I is the current, A∗ Richardson’s constant, A the
Schottky contact area, e the electron charge, φb the Schottky
barrier height, k the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute
temperature, V the applied voltage, and n the ideality factor.
The ideality factor is derived to be 6.3 from the slope in
the linear region in figure 5. The Schottky barrier height is
0.42 eV when A∗ is estimated to be 90 A K−2 cm−2 for single
crystalline diamond [20]. The cut-in (turn-on) voltage and the
on-state resistance RON are −0.5 V and 4.5 × 10−3  cm2,
respectively, for the single crystalline Al/diamond Schottky
diode. Note that the derived Schottky barrier height is lower
than the previously reported value of 0.8 eV for an Al/diamond
Schottky diode made on a single crystalline hydrogenated
diamond [7]. The Schottky barrier height lowering was also
observed by Hayashi et al in their characterization of the
surface conductive layer on the hydrogenated homoepitaxial
diamond film [6]. Their experimental evidence supported
the existence of a high density of shallow acceptors in the
subsurface of the hydrogenated homoepitaxial diamond film.
Similar to their work, the reduction of Schottky barrier height
in our case is also attributed to the tunneling of holes through
the barrier owing to the high density of shallow acceptors.
Note that the Schottky barrier height of 0.42 eV in our work is
less than 0.6 eV reported by Hayashi et al for the Al/diamond
Schottky diode fabricated on the hydrogenated homoepitaxial
diamond film. This may explain the occurrence of the very

SCDR.
ultra-high current density of 1.4 × 104 A cm−2 at −3 V for the
Al/diamond Schottky diamond fabricated on a hydrogenated
SCDR.
The temperature dependence of the I –V characteristics
of the Al/diamond Schottky diode was also characterized
in air. Both forward and reverse current densities increase
with temperature, as shown in figure 6. The Schottky
barrier height and the ideality factor at different temperatures
are derived through the thermionic emission equation and
plotted in figure 7. The derived Schottky barrier height
can be treated as an approximate value since the ideality
factor is much larger than one. The Schottky barrier height
increases with temperature and the ideality factor reduces with
temperature, which are in good agreement with previously
published results [21]. The temperature dependence is an
indication of Schottky inhomogeneity at the Al/diamond
Schottky contacts. The Schottky inhomogeneity probably
results from the nonuniform surface defects of the single
crystalline diamond rod.
In summary, the Al/diamond Schottky diode with
rectifying characteristics can be fabricated on a SCDR of
submicron diameter. The SCDR is extracted from the single

One-dimensional boron-doped submicron diamond rods (SDRs) were fabricated on diamond/Si substrates by oxygen plasma etch-
ing. The SDRs are 4.5 mm in height and 383 nm in diameter. Iron oxide coated on SDRs is essential in the formation of one-
dimensional SDRs. However, the as-etched SDRs suffer with high turn-on field (ETO) and low field emission current density (JFE)
due to the iron oxide. A huge improvement in the field emission characteristics can be achieved by removing iron oxide using a
wet-etch process in a diluted HCl (37%). After the wet-etch, the SDRs exhibit a low ETO value of4.5 V/mm (at 10 mA/cm
2) and a
high JFE value of 30 mA/cm
2 (at 8.5 V/mm). The FE emitter is only stable for a short period of time at high current stress owing to
the rounding of the tips of SDRs.

Excellent field emitters should exhibit channels of high con-
ductivity and high aspect ratio to enhance local electric field at
the top end.1 Different material processing techniques have been
developed to fabricate one-dimensional carbon related nanostruc-
tures with high aspect ratio, such as amorphous carbon nanotip,2
carbon nanofiber (CNF),3 carbon nanotube (CNT),4–6 and dia-
mond nanotips or nanocones.7,8 Among them, CNT exhibits the
best characteristics of field emitters because of its low turn-on
field (ETO) value (2–5 V/mm at 10 mA/cm
2) and high filed emis-
sion current density (JFE) value (20–30 mA/cm
2 at 5–6 V/mm).4–6
However, CNT field emitters have disadvantages such as unstable
emission current at high voltage, damage at high temperature and
short life-time.9
Diamond is a potential material for excellent field emitters com-
parable or superior to CNT since it exhibits negative electron affin-
ity, chemical stability, and strong mechanical strength.10–14 Doping
is necessary for diamond emitters, because the conductivity can be
greatly improved.12–14 Diamond field emitter may be made by either
nano-crystalline diamond films or one-dimensional nanostructure of
diamond. The best reported nano-crystalline diamond field emitter
exhibits a low ETO value of 6.2 V/mm at 10 mA/cm
2 and a JFE value
of 1mA/cm2 at 8.5 V/mm (Ref. 8) that are worse than CNT field
emitters. Carriers in the nano-crystalline diamond are transported
along grain boundaries via sp2 bonds15,16 Diamond field emitters
can be improved by increasing their aspect ratio using one-dimen-
sional diamond tip reported by M.-Y. Chen et al.7 A low ETO value
of 3 V/mm at 10 mA/cm2 and a JFE value of 4 mA/cm
2 at 9 V/mm
were achieved. However, the JFE value is much less than CNT field
emitters.
In this article, we present a simple method to fabricate one-
dimensional diamond field emitters with excellent field emission
(FE) performance comparable to CNTs. Vertical aligned B-doped
submicron diamond rods (SDRs) with high aspect ratio are fabri-
cated by oxygen plasma etching. A wet etching treatment can
remove the surface oxide layer and further improve the FE charac-
teristics of the one-dimensional SDRs.
Experimental
One-dimensional SDRs were fabricated on the polycrystalline
diamond/Si substrate by oxygen plasma etching in a capacitance
coupled plasma (CCP) chamber operated at a radio frequency
(RF) of 13.56 MHz. The RF power source was operated at 100
W. The total oxygen gas pressure was kept at 15 mTorr and the
self-bias voltage was 1300 V during etching. The substrate tem-
perature increased from room temperature to 200C at the end
of each run due to ion bombardment. The thickness of the poly-
crystalline diamond film was determined to be 15 mm by field
emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (JEOL JSE-
6500F). The morphologies of the wet-etched samples were char-
acterized by FESEM. Nano-Auger (PHI 700) and X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS; ESCA 1600) were used to character-
ize the chemical information of SDRs. The acquisition of FE data
were carried out in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure at
2 106 torr in a planar diode configuration at room temperature.
The emission area was defined to be 0.01 cm2 in the FE meas-
urements. The inter-electrode spacing was adjusted to be 100
lm by an optical microscope with a charge-coupled device
(CCD) camera. Both the anode and cathode pads were made of
copper and connected to a computer controlled Keithley 2410
source meter.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the FE characteristics of the one-dimensional
submicron diamond rods (SDRs) fabricated on the diamond/Si
substrates by oxygen plasma etching and followed by different
treatments. Very low current density occurs for the polished
polycrystalline diamond/Si substrate. The FE characteristics are
improved when SDRs are fabricated on the polished polycrys-
talline diamond/Si substrate after oxygen plasma etching for 6
h. The ETO value (at 10 mA/cm
2) reduces from 9.3 to 5.9 V/mm
and the JFE value (at 8.5 V/mm) increases from 0.001 to 0.47
mA/cm2. The improvement in FE characteristics is attributed to
the formation of SDRs with higher aspect ratio. The corre-
sponding Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) Plot in the inset is linear,
indicating that electron emission of SDRs follows the classic
field emission mechanism.
When SDRs are etched in HCl, better FE performance
occurs. The ETO value becomes 4.5 V/mm and JFE value greatly
increases to 30 mA/cm2 at 8.5 V/mm. The FE characteristics are
comparable to those of CNT field emitters and much better than
the nano-crystalline diamond field emitter reported in the
literature.8
SDRs are characterized using FESEM, NanoAuger and
ESCA to extract surface morphology and surface chemical in-
formation. Figure 2a shows one-dimensional diamond rods ver-
tically aligned fabricated on diamond/Si substrates after oxygen

rods. Therefore, Fe is not a contamination source in our work,
which takes parts in the formation of one-dimensional SDRs.
The Fe2O3 coating on the SDRs is detrimental to the FE per-
formance and needs to be removed. A huge improvement of FE
current density is achieved by when SDRs are chemical etched in
HCl. Figure 3a shows the FESEM image of the SDRs on dia-
mond/Si substrates after the wet-etch. Two main features appear.
First, SDRs become thinner in diameter (195 nm). Second, the
tubular structure at the top part of SDRs almost disappears. The
removal of the iron oxide at the top end may make SDRs shorter.
Moreover, the iron oxide layers on SDRs are completely removed
after the wet-etch, which is supported by the disappearance of
both Fe LMM and O KLL signals taken at three different loca-
tions as shown in Fig. 3b. The huge improvement of FE charac-
teristics after the wet-etch is thus attributed to the removal of the
iron oxide layer.
The FE stability of the SDR emitter was evaluated at stress cur-
rent densities of 4 and 8 mA/cm2, as shown in Fig. 4. The SRD
emitter is stable within a critical time and starts to decay exponen-
tially to a stationary current density value of 0.1 mA/cm2. The
critical time for the SDR emitter was measured to be 75 and 25 min
for stress current densities of 4 and 8 mA/cm2, respectively. The ex-
ponential decay is attributed to the rounding of the top end of each
SDR as shown in the FESEM images in Figs. 5a and 5b. In other
words, the power loss may result in heating and cause the rounding
to occur.
Conclusion
One-dimensional SDRs with high aspect ratio have been
illustrated to be promising material for high performance field
emitters. An oxygen plasma etching and a subsequent chemical
etch in HCl are effective in making one-dimensional diamond

A mask-free plasma etching process is described to fabricate 6 μm long submicron diamond rods (SDRs) in
long conical shape. Polished polycrystalline diamond is etched in oxygen plasma ignited at a pressure of
10 mTorr by radio-frequency power of 100 W at 13.56 MHz. Each SDR is a bi-crystal, consisting of two
diamond crystallites of micron size. The SDR is coated with a Fe2O3 layer, as characterized by Auger electron
spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. We propose that a
“self-forming”mask of Fe2O3 is generated during the etching process in which iron atoms sputtered from the
substrate holder are deposited and oxidized on the diamond surface forming “micromask” that protects the
underlying diamond and promotes the formation of SDRs.

1. Introduction
Interest in the development of diamond-based electronics is
driven mainly by its unique properties including a high breakdown
ﬁeld, wide energy band gap, high hole mobility, and high electron
saturation velocity [1–4]. In order to take advantage of these unique
properties for one-dimensional device applications, a method of
fabricating straight and long diamond rods is essential. In 1997,
Shiomi et al. ﬁrst reported the fabrication of porous diamond by
etching chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond ﬁlms in a mixed
plasma of CF4 and O2 [5]. Since then, plasma etching has become the
primary technique for fabricating various structures on diamond
ﬁlms, such as through-hole, whisker, wire and rod [6–11]. Previously,
various masks were applied for fabricating one-dimensional struc-
tures on diamond ﬁlms. In 2002, arrays of both SiO2 particles and
aluminum dots were utilized as the masks to fabricate diamond rods
[7,8]. In 2008, Zou et al. reported using gold nanodots as an etching
mask to fabricate diamond nanopillars in hydrogen/Argon plasma [9].
Moreover, even diamond nano-particles have been used as an etching
mask to fabricate diamond nano-wires in O2/CF4 plasma as demon-
strated by Yung et al. [10].
In 2000, Baik et al. reported the formation of aligned diamond
whiskers of ~3 μm in length on grain boundaries of the diamond
substrate using dry etching in air plasma without preformed
molybdenum (Mo) metal mask, i. e. a mask-free process [11]. Mo
and oxygen (O) were found relatively strong on the top end of
diamond whiskers. The Mo deposits were attributed to accidental
sputtering of the Mo substrate holder. They proposed that Mo or Mo
oxide on the top of the whisker would inhibit etching of the diamond
ﬁlm underneath. In other words, the Mo or Mo oxide acted as the
“micromask.” In 2009, Wei et al. reported a mask-free process to
fabricate boron doped diamond nanograss for electrochemical sensors
using a heavily boron doped diamond ﬁlm [12]. Boron oxide was
proposed to form on the surface and to serve as an etching mask.
Recently, Szunerits et al. and Cofﬁnier et al. have illustrated the
fabrication of diamond nanowires and nanograss array using the same
mask-free process [13,14].
In this work, we attempt to produce straight diamond rods longer
than 6 μm useful for the fabrication of one-dimensional devices. A
regular array of diamond rods is not crucial for this purpose since
diamond rods will be scratched off for further device processing. A
mask-free process is thus chosen for the study. Here, we report the
fabrication of very long one dimensional submicron diamond rods
(SDRs) on polished polycrystalline substrates by oxygen plasma
etching using a mask-free process. An Auger nanoscope, a chemical
detection tool with 10 nm spatial resolution, is used to characterize
the surface chemical information of a SDR. The SDRs are coated with
iron oxide “micromask” all over the surface, rather than only on the
top surface as reported by Baik et al. A mechanism for the formation of
the SDRs on the diamond surface is proposed.
2. Experimental
A polished undoped polycrystalline diamond/Si(100) substrate of
25 μm thickness was cleansed and put on a steel substrate holder of 4
in. in diameter and then placed in a capacitively coupled radio

with etching time. However, the outmost diameter increases with
etching time, suggesting that a concurrent deposition process may be
taking place on the surface of SDRs during oxygen plasma etching.
This is attributed to the re-deposition of the atoms sputtered from the
steel sample holder during plasma etching, which is conﬁrmed by the
observation of Fe signal on the rod surface using Nano-Auger and
ESCA and will be discussed later. Note that the inner diameter
increases with etching time as shown in Fig. 2(b). This indicates that
an etching also occurs inside the tubes at the proximal tip of SDRs. The
wall thickness of SDRs also increases with etching time, suggesting
that re-deposition rate on the outer surfaces of SDRs is higher than the
etching rate inside the tube. Clearly, the fabrication process of SDRs is
complex since both re-deposition and etching simultaneously occur at
different parts of SDRs.
The chemical composition of the outer surface of a SDR was
determined using Nano-AES and ESCA. Fig. 3(a)–(d) show the O KLL
and Fe LMM Auger spectra taken at three different locations of a SDR
before and after argon (Ar) sputtering. Three locations at the top,
middle and bottom sections of the SDR are marked in the FESEM
image in the inset. Fe LMM and O KLL appear simultaneously at these
three locations before Ar sputtering, implying the formation of iron
oxide all over the rod surface. The most obvious source of iron is the
steel substrate holder. With continued Ar sputtering, Fe LMM and O
KLL, while still present at the top and middle sections of the SDRs,
begin to disappear at the bottom section. This suggests that iron oxide
deposition is thicker at the top and middle sections. The chemical
state of the iron oxide can be characterized by ESCA. The energy
position of the Fe 2p in Fig. 4 is the same as that of Fe2O3 [15]. This is
conclusive evidence that Fe2O3 is formed on the outer surface of the
SDR during plasma etching.
A wet etching process was therefore used to remove Fe2O3 and any
amorphous carbon on the SDRs using HCl and HNO3 in sequence. As
shown in Fig. 5(a), no Fe LMM signal can be detected within the
detection limit. The structural information of the wet etched SDR was
characterized by TEM. The bright ﬁeld TEM image of the SDR in Fig. 5(a)
indicates that the wet-etched SDR possesses a long conical, rather than
cylindrical shape. Two types of electron diffraction (ED) patterns with
different orientationwereobservedwhen electron beamswere scanned
along thewet-etched SDR. BothEDpatterns correspond to twodiamond

extracted single crystalline diamond rods may be used to fabricate one-
dimensional diamond devices.
Three major features were observed for the fabrication of SDRs
using the mask-free etching process. First, each SDR is in long conical
shape. Second, each SDR has a tubular structure at the top end. Finally,
outer diameter, inner diameter and wall thickness increase with
etching time for each SDR. The formation mechanism of SDRs is
proposed and schematically shown in Fig. 6(a)–(e). First, the Fe atoms
are sputtered from the steel substrate holder and then deposited on
the diamond surface. The deposited Fe atoms are rapidly oxidized in
oxygen plasma and act as “micromasks.” Second, a diamond rod
structure starts to form since the diamond ﬁlm outside the Fe2O3
“micromask” is etched away by oxygen plasma (Fig. 6(c)). Simulta-
neously, newly sputtered Fe atoms from the steel substrate holder are
continuously deposited and oxidized on the tubular surface of the
SDRs as the etching process progresses. A thin Fe2O3 layer coats the
surface and protects the diamond from further etching. However, the
Fe2O3 “micromask” on the top end surface of the SDR is not thick
enough to sustain plasma etching for long. Some thinner portion of
the Fe2O3 “micromask” near the center of the exposed end is etched
away, leading to the formation of the tubular structure by consecutive
etching as qualitatively shown in Fig. 6(c)–(e). Note that the Fe2O3
continues to deposit onto SDRs during plasma etching. The process
accounts for the continuous increase of the outer diameter with
etching time for each SDR. As anticipated, the Fe2O3 layer on the rod
surface of the upper part of the SDR is thicker than that on the lower
part because of longer deposition time. This is supported by the Auger
spectra data depicted in Fig. 3(a)–(d) which demonstrate thicker iron
oxide on the SDR surface at the top part.
The role of electric ﬁeld near the top end of the SDR is considered
not the physical reason for the formation of the tubular structure in
the beginning (Fig. 6(c)). In general, the electric ﬁeld would be
strongest at the outer perimeter of the exposed end of the SDR and
weaker near the center of the exposed end. This electric ﬁeld
distribution would not lead to a hollow tube. The formation of tubular
structure is attributed to the protection of the re-deposited Fe2O3 near
the outer perimeter of the exposed end. This is supported by the Fe, O
and C nano-Auger line proﬁles across the top end of the SDR as shown
in Fig. 7(a) and (b). Fe and O appear near the outer perimeter of the
exposed end of the SDR (Fig. 7(a)). The Fe and O intensities near the
outer perimeter are higher than that near the center of the SDR. When
the SDR is in situ sputtered in Ar for 5 min, Fe and O reduce and C
increases in intensity near the outer perimeter. All these data support
that Fe2O3 dominates near outer perimeter of the top end. The Fe2O3
serves as a protectionmask near the outer perimeter such that plasma
etching continues near the center leading to the formation of the
tubular structure.
Note that Szunerits et al. and Cofﬁnier et al. used heavily boron
doped diamond ﬁlms in the fabrication of nanowires and nanograss
[13,14]. They proposed that boron oxide was formed on the surface as
the mask for selective etching in oxygen plasma. A boron doped
diamond ﬁlm was required in their fabrication process. In contrast, no
boron oxide can be formed on the undoped diamond ﬁlm in our work.
Our data support that Fe2O3 is responsible for the selective etching in
oxygen plasma.
4. Conclusion
A mask-free etching process has been developed for the fabrication
of very long aligned diamond rods of submicron size by oxygen plasma
etching. During the oxygen plasma etching process, Fe atoms are
liberated from the steel substrate holder, deposited and oxidized on the
diamond substrate as Fe2O3. This compound serves as a “self-forming”
mask that promotes the formation of the SDRs. Each SDR consists of two
single crystalline diamond grains in conical shape, and approximately
6 μm in length. Each SDR is coated with a protective layer of Fe2O3 as it
forms, ensuring survival in the oxygen plasma environment.
