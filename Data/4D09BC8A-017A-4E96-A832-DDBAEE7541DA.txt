Abstract： 
 This proposal proposes a rigorous design method for suppressing the higher 
order spurious responses of the dual-passband microstrip bandpass filters composed 
of stepped impedance resonators (SIRs). The line widths of the SIR and the gap 
size between SIRs provide two freedoms for determining the realizable fractional 
bandwidth of the two passbands. The inherent transmission zeros of coupled SIRs 
are used to suppress the unwanted spurious responses. A complete design procedure 
considering both the synthesis of passband responses and the suppression of 
spurious responses is detailed depicted in this paper. Two filters are designed and 
fabricated to demonstrate this idea. The measured results of them show that the 
upper stopbands can be suppressed below -35.4dB up to 5.7 f0 and -27dB up to 
more than 12f0 respectively.

In this proposal, the ideas in [11] and [15] are extended to design dual-passband filters with 
multi-spurious suppression. It is found microstrip coupled stages made of stepped impedance 
resonator (SIR) can also have inherent transmission zeros as those made of uniform impedance 
resonator (UIR) in [15]. These transmission zeros can be adequately located by tuning the 
coupling lengths of coupled stages to effectively suppress the unwanted spurious responses. 
Under the condition of stationary impedance ratio and length ratio, the line width of SIR can 
provide an extra freedom for the bandwidth determination at the two passbands.  
 
二、 研究方法： 
(一)、 Design Ideas： 
Fig. 1 plots the frequency responses of both UIR and SIR coupled stages with the same 
coupling length l for comparison. It can be shown that both UIR and SIR coupled stages possess 
inherent transmission zeros. Besides, the transmission zero of SIR has an even better attenuation 
level up to -60dB. As depicted in Fig. 2, the location of the transmission zero can be shifted from 
4.8GHz to 15GHz by varying the coupling length l from 27mm to 9.7mm. Therefore, the 
spurious responses of a dual-passband filter composed of parallel coupled SIRs can be effectively 
suppressed by adequately designing the coupling length l of each coupled stage. However, once 
the coupling length l is used to determine the position of attenuation pole, another parameter 
must be found to provide an additional freedom for fractional bandwidth design of the 
dual-passband filter in [11]. Line width of the SIR could be a suitable alternative. Nevertheless, 
how to keep the resonant characteristic of a SIR stationary as its line width is varied would be a 
following problem. As derived in [16], the impedance ratio R=Z2/Z1 and length ratio u=θ2/(θ1+θ2) 
govern the resonant condition of a SIR. If the two key factors can be kept invariant, the influence 
of the line width variation on the SIR property can be out of consideration theoretically. 
Simulated frequency responses of the SIRs with identical impedance and length ratios but 
different line widths (line impedances) are derived by the commercial full-wave EM simulator 
IE3D and plotted in Fig. 3. The impedance and length ratios (R and u) are fixed to be 0.4 and 0.5 
respectively and three line widths corresponding to different impedance values (Z1) are adopted. 
It can be verified that the resonant characteristic of a SIR is almost irrelevant to the line width 
variation as soon as the impedance and length ratios are kept stationary. Consequently, the line 
widths of SIRs can provide the required freedom for bandwidth design while the lengths of 
coupled stages are used to locate transmission zeros for spurious suppression. 
(二)、 Design Procedure： 
The systematic design procedure of the dual-passband filter can be mainly divided into three 
portions. First, the structural parameters of the constitutive SIRs including impedance ratio R and 
length ratio u must be determined. Then, in order to settle the coupling scheme of each coupled 
stage, the fractional bandwidth design graph considering both passband must be founded. At last, 
the decision of tapped-line input/output position and dual-frequency impedance transformer 
should be accomplished. Each step of the design procedure will be particularly interpreted as 
following.

be extraordinary. Instead of gap size d and coupling length l of the SIR coupled stage in [11], as 
shown in Fig. 6, the line width W1 and gap size S provide two freedoms for bandwidth design 
while the coupling length lov is responsible for positioning the frequency of the transmission zero. 
It must be noted that the line width W2 is varied with W1 according to the stabilized impedance 
ratio R. Before building up the design graph, the operating frequencies (f0 and f1) and SIR 
parameters (R and u) must be determined in advance. The coupling coefficient C of two 
resonators having a close proximity can be represented as [16]

where fa and fb are the frequencies of resonant peaks obtained by using excitation through a gap to 
the outer ends of the coupled resonators. Before deriving the coupling coefficient of a couple 
stage with certain W1 and S values, the coupling length lov must be determined in advance for 
positioning the transmission zero at the frequency of spurious response expected to be suppressed. 
An Nth-order filter is composed of N resonators. The coupling coefficients between the ith and 
(i+1)th resonators can be specified as [18]

prototype, '1ω is the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter prototype, and the subscript j = 1 or 2 
denotes the first or the second passband. Afterwards, the dual-band fractional bandwidth design 
graph can be founded. 
C. Tapped Input/Output and Impedance Transformer 
The last step is to determine the form of power input/output. Tapped-line input is adopted at 
end resonators of the filter. As in [19], the singly loaded Q(Qsi) of a tapped resonator can be 
expressed as

where RL is the load impedance seen at the tap point by the resonator toward the input/output port 
and B(ω) = (Y1+Y2) is the total susceptance of the resonator seen at the tap point as indicated in 
Fig. 7. The singly loaded Qsi in (5) is obviously a function of the tap position x in Fig. 7. For a  
= 1.0315, and g2,1 = g2,2 = 1.1474. The coupling coefficients between SIRs can be obtained by the 
method illustrated in Part B of Section Ⅲ. It should be noted that the coupling lengths of the 
coupled stages lov must be determined in advance for positioning the transmission zeros at f2 
(3.998 f0). Hence, the fractional bandwidth design graph can be established as plot in Fig. 8. 
Based on Fig. 8, one can know the feasible bandwidths of the dual-passband filter beforehand. 
For example, a straight line representing identical fractional bandwidth (Δ1 = Δ2) is plot in Fig. 8 
and has no solution within the given ranges of W1/h and S/h for designing a dual-passband filter. 
However, when both passbands possess same absolute bandwidth, i.e., Δ1/Δ2 = 5.8/2.45 = 2.37, 
achievable Δ1 is from 9.41% to 21.35% and Δ2 is from 3.98% to 9.02%, as indicated in Fig. 8. 
Now, the fractional bandwidths Δ1 and Δ2 are set to be 12% and 5.07% respectively (identical 
absolute bandwidth). From Fig. 8, the necessary circuit sizes of the coupled stage, S/h and W1/h, 
are 0.695 and 0.285 by interpolation approximation. The thickness of the substrate h = 0.508mm, 
and hence the gap size S and line width W1 of the coupled stage are 0.353mm and 0.145mm. 
Besides, W2 = 1.181mm for Z2 = 0.4Z1 and lov = 16.05mm for positioning the transmission zero 
of coupled stage at f2 = 3.998f0 = 9.8GHz. What left is to determine the tapped input/output 
position. Based on (8), the Δ1/Δ2 curve against tap position x in Fig. 7 can be plot in Fig. 9. By 
Fig. 9, the tap position can be easily determined once the Δ1/Δ2 ratio is given. A straight line 
representing Δ1/Δ2 = 12/5.07 = 2.37 is plot in Fig. 9, and the two intersections with Δ1/Δ2 curve 
determine the necessary tapped position x/2(l1+l2) to be 0.297 or 0.703. Based on (6) and (7), the 
load impedances RL1 and RL2 can be then computed and has identical value equal to 209.5 Ω. 
According to the design method for dual-frequency impedance transformer in [20], the 
dimensions of the impedance transformer can be derived. As indicated in Fig. 8, the values of Za, 
Zb, la and lb are 88 Ω, 119Ω, 13.69mm and 13.69mm respectively. Up to now, the filter design 
has been accomplished. The filter is simulated by the full-wave commercial EM simulator IE3D 
and fabricated on a high frequency laminate RT/duroid® 5880 with εr = 2.2 and h = 0.508mm. 
The simulation and measured frequency responses are plot in Fig. 10(a), and Fig. 10(b) is the 
circuit layout. It can be shown that the measured frequency responses agree well with the 
simulation ones. The measured insertion losses at the centers of the first and second passbands 
are -1.1 dB and -1.7 dB respectively, and the return losses for both bands are below -13.8 dB. The 
measured spurious response at f2 (3.998f0 = 9.8GHz) can be suppressed below -35.4 dB and the 
upper stopband can be extended to f3 (5.62f0 = 13.77GHz). 
B. Fifth-Order Dual-Passband Filter 
A bandpass filter with higher order can not only enhance the passband selectivity but also 
possess more couple stages to produce transmission zeros for harmonics suppression. However, 
as the order exceeds three, some modifications to the filter synthesis procedure must be made. 
Take a fifth–order dual-passband filter plot in Fig. 11 (a) as an example. The filter in Fig. 11 (a) 
has five resonators (SIR1~SIR5) and four coupled stages (CS1~CS4). Two coupled stages CS1 and 
CS4 are expected to suppress the spurious response at f2 while CS2 and CS3 are used to cope with 
the unwanted harmonic at f3. Owing to that different coupled stages may need diverse coupling 
coefficients, the constitutive SIR may have unsymmetrical structure as plot in Fig. 11(b). The SIR 
in Fig. 11(b) is the scale-up version of SIR2 in Fig. 11(a). The input impedance Zin = 1/Yin = 
1/(Yl+Yr) seen at the center of the SIR in Fig 11(b) can be derived. The resonant conditions for
