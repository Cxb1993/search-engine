英文摘要 
 Human suffering from vertigo might experience their body tilting and may eventually fall 
down. The analytical understanding and applications of human postural control could 
possibly be extended to understand the postural sway. On the basis of a human body model 
with nine segments and articulation at the neck, waist, hip, knee, and ankle, this research 
report presents a two stage feedback control law for assisting balance in the human’s 
standing posture under interference of subjective verticals. A robust control law is 
developed to guarantee postural stability under vertigo. The control theory is expected to 
be used as a basis for posture control of intelligent humanoid robots.

divides the perception of gravity from the

IV. CONTROL DESIGN 
 
A two stage feedback control design  that 
allows the joints of the nine-segmented body 
model to rotate is proposed to maintain body 
balance. The primary control law is adopted in the 
following form [2,3]: 
 
( ) ( ) ( )  d d dv pD q K q q K q q uτ τ ⎡ ⎤= − − + − + Δ⎣ ⎦    (21) 
 
where dτ  is the desired generalized torque vector, 
uΔ  is a correction term that can be used  to 
eliminate the effect of uncertainties of closed-loop 
system , vK  and pK  are both respectively the 
24× 24 velocity and position control gain matrices 
included to decrease the tracking error 
( ( ) ( ))de q t q t= − .  
 
Substituting (9) and (20) into (21) results in the 
following  error  dynamics: 
 
( ( ))[( ( ) ( )) ( ( ) ( )) ( ( ) ( ))]
 ( ( )) [ ( ( )) ( ( ))]                           (22)

Or equivalently,

where  
1( ( ) , ( ) ,  ) ( ( ))[ ( ( )) ( ( ))]d df q t q t t D q t c q t c q t− ′= −  (24) 
         
The error dynamics can be further written in the 
state-space representation as

24 24100000 , 250p vK I K I= =  (34) 
 
According to the pK and vK , the eigenvalues of 
the A matrix in  (25)  can be computed as 
1.25  2.9047i− +  or 1.25  2.9047i− −  . Besides, 
( , )x tη was estimated as 10 +110x  , the time 
constant =5 (sec)T ,  = 9.8f −   2(m /sec )  and 0.9ε = . 
In Fig.3, it is supposed that only 
22 23 24,   and  q q q   can enter the SCCs because 
22 23 24,  and q q q    represent  the angular velocities 
near the head. Furthermore, the transfer function 
of  SCCs is in the following form:

The percentage of weight (see Table 2), the 
moment of inertia  and  the product of  inertia of  
the nine-segmented human body model were 
calculated on the basis of  [11] and then iJ  were 
obtained. The control command dq was set as  
24 1×  zero vector for all times and the initial states 
of  ( 1 ~ 24)iq i =   were assumed to be zero. The 
simulation time was 140 seconds. The results are 
displayed  in Fig. 4.

The position errors in Fig. 4 swayed slightly 
within 0~60 seconds because xg , yg and zg  also 
kept swaying during 0~60 seconds. Position 
errors converged to some constant after 60 
seconds. The maximum position error in Fig. 4 
was about 0.28− degree and kept approximately to 
0.15− degree after 60 seconds. The simulation 
results revealed  that the closed-loop system still 
maintained its stability under vertigo.   
 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
 
This research simulates vertigo phenomenon 
by using the  perception of gravity  as feedback 
signal. The controller contains two parts. The 
primary part is developed to track the desired 
reference trajectory and the secondary part is 
designed to eliminate the effect of uncertainties. 
A nine-segmented human body system is 
developed as the plant for verifying the control 
methodology proposed. The control theory 
developed will be used as a basis for posture 
control of intelligent humanoid robots in the near 
future.

the angular coordinate [ ]1 2 Tq q q= . Using the 
analysis of classical mechanics (Johansson et al., 
1995), the torque equilibrium for a standing person 
subject to the gravitation forces can be derived as 
follows 
( ) ( , ) ( )M q q C q q G q τ+ + =                (1) 
where the first term denotes inertia force, ( , )C q q  
denotes the centripetal and Coriolis forces; ( )G q  
denotes the gravitation forces and torques, 
respectively.  
 
CNS Sensory – vestibular: Canal-otolith interaction 
Subjective vertical orientation, eye and body 
movements all depend on the way our central nervous 
system deals with the gravito-inertial force resolution 
problem. The main cause is unobviousness of 
accelerations motion resulting from gravity (Bos and 
Bles, 2002). In order to control body or eye 
movements, the motion of accelerations should be 
known explicitly. In Mayne (1974), the author has 
given a solution for the estimation of body movement. 
 
Semicircular canal (SCC) detects angular velocity  
There are some orthogonal semicircular canals within 
every human’s inner ears. The neural signals are 
proportional to a high pass filtered angular velocity 
signal. This implies that the SCC are insensitive to 
constant angular head velocity (Bos, et al., 2002). 
 
Otoliths (OTO) detects specific force 
 In the SCC connecting the canals, there are two 
layers of hair cells with crystals (on top) in which 
crystals have a higher specific density than the 
surrounding matter. There are 9 DOFs motion which 
includes three inertial acceleration components, three 
gravity components, and three angular velocities. And 
f a g= +  (2) 
where the specific force f  reflects the gravito-inertial 
acceleration.

Fig.2 GIF-recognition model 
In order to recognize the inertial acceleration motion 
a , the gravitational acceleration eg g= should be 
subtracted from the specific force f , i.e. 
a f g= −  (3) 
Then in head coordinate, we have 
1( )h h ea f R gω
−= −  (4) 
where Rω  represents the matrix determined by canal 
information ω  to rotate the head-reference hf  into 
an earth-reference vector ef . Because the estimate of 
gravity hg  is given with respect to the head, the term  
1Rω
−  is incorporated. The indexes e  and h  refer to 
earth and head, respectively, and ω  indicating the 
rotation matrix is determined by the angular velocity 
sensed by the SCC. However, (4) is solvable only if 
ω  and eg g=  are known exactly. In practice, ω  
cannot be known precisely, especially when the 
angular velocity is not constant. Furthermore, there is 
no way to precisely know g . However, Mayne (1974) 
has given a solution to this problem, who suggested a 
low pass filter to operate on otolith afferents. While 
accelerations due to self propelled motion are 
changed and angular motions are sensed, the process 
of estimating both of the gravitational component and 
the inertial acceleration can be constructed as in Fig.

transfer function are given, respectively, by

3. CANAL-OTOLITH INTERATION MODEL 
The simple feedback servo model shown in Fig. 1 
might be unstable due to the excessive delay in the 
feedback loop. It may also cause problems in the state 
estimation. As in the traditional time delay control 
system, a Smith predictor can be applied to deal with 
this problem (Morasso, et al. 1999).

Fig. 7 Control of human body with disturbances 
caused by the effect of vertigo 
 
adds the horizontal acceleration sing θ  around an 
earth horizontal. Therefore, the body dynamics will 
be correspondingly changed due to the subjective 
vertical. The body will be unstable, because the two 
accelerations will change the body dynamics and 
induce the perturbed joint torque ( )tτ . This effect can 
be viewed as a one kind of body dizziness. We now 
determine the body dynamics which is affected by 
subjective vertical that rotates with the angular 
velocity xω .Referring to Fig. 6, the potential energy 
( )U q  of the segmented body is found as the sum of 
the potential energy of each one of the segments. 
Therefore, ( )G q  in (1) is transformed to ( )G q , where 
the gravitational acceleration  around the earth 
vertical is transformed to cosg θ  . The horizontal 
acceleration sing θ  around the earth horizontal axis 
generates a horizontal force, and Flτ =  acts on the 
centre of mass. For the masses 1m  and 2m , we have

The body dynamics affected by the subjective vertical 
static tilt is called as the SV illusive body dynamics. 
Now we assumed the time constant is T and from (10) 
it can be described as T θ ω= , then the sensed vertical  
only deviates from true verticality by an amount 
Tθ ω≈ , then The body dynamics is shown below

Fig. 8 Primary and secondary control of human body

term ( )G q . It changes ( )G q  to ( )G q τ+  . The vertical 
component of g , i.e. zg , only has relation with ( )G q  
and the horizontal component 
yg  only has relation 
with τ . That is ( ) ( ) zG q G q g=   and ygτ τ=  . 
We assume that the head keeps parallel to body like 
Fig. 6 without considering the nerve delay. The block 
diagram for control of human body with disturbance 
caused by the effect of vertigo is illustrated Fig. 7. In 
this figure, eω  is the external angular acceleration and 
ω  is the body’s angular acceleration generated by 
self-motion. 
 
4. CONTROL DESIGN 
The input of the body system can be chosen as the 
generalized torques produced by the joint actuator, 
and the outputs are the position, velocity and 
acceleration of the joint. The actual position, velocity 
and acceleration of the joint in the manipulator can be 
compared with their desired values to drive the plant. 
To make the end-effector accurately tracking the 
desired nominal trajectory, the generalized torques 
should be appropriately applied to generate the 
desired motion under ideal operating conditions. The 
controller generating commands is referred to as the 
primary controller. It compensates for the nonlinear 
effects and attempts to cancel the nonlinear terms in 
the model. The secondary controller compensates for 
the modelling uncertainty and internal/external 
disturbances to avoid posture instability and 
performance deterioration. 
 
The primary control law proposed is given in the 
following form:  
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )d d dv pt t M q K q q K q q uτ τ ⎡ ⎤= − − + − + Δ⎣ ⎦     (16) 
where dτ  holds under ideal circumstances between 
the desired trajectory and the corresponding 
generalized torque, it is now affected by the SV 
illusive effect: 
          ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( )d d d d d d dM q q C q q G q qτ τ= + + +     (17) 
To analyze the control system specified by (1), (16) 
and (17), we assume 
( ) ( ),  ( , ) ( , ),d d dM q M q C q q C q q= =    
( ) ( )dG q G q=           (18) 
The proposed control scheme was simulated on a two 
degrees of freedom feedback model of the human 
postural analogue to an inverted double pendulum 
with possible motion at the hip and ankle. We 
assumed that 5 ,     if 1

The parameters of the uncertainty bounding function 
( , )e tη  were obtained as

The parameter ε  of the controller (31) was chosen as 
0.0001. The matrix Q  in the Lyapunov matrix 
equation (21) was set as diag(1000, 100, 10, 1.0). 
Figure 9 presents the resultant simulated responses. 
Clearly, the closed-loop system remains to be stable 
when there is in the presence of an external 
disturbance. Furthermore, the tracking error 
converges after 20 s.  
 
6. CONCLUSION 
A primary and secondary controller have been 
designed based on a two-order dynamic model of the 
human upright standing posture with consideration of  
the plant uncertainty due to the effect of vertigo. An 
integrated robust control scheme is proposed where 
the primary controller provides a fundamental 
movement tracking to the reference command and the 
secondary controller compensates for the plant 
uncertainty to ensure stability of the emulated human 
body system. This research presents the potential for 
designing the postural control system for the future 
humanoid robots.

We  further  assume that the  inertia matrix and cen-
tripetal and Coriolis terms in the dizzy state are the same 
as the normal state so that the body dynamics suffering

IV. CONTROLLER DESIGN  
A two stage feedback control design  that allows the 
joints of the nine-segmented body model to rotate is 
proposed to maintain body balance. The primary control 
law is adopted in the following form [2,3]:

where dτ  is the desired generalized torque vector, u∆  is 
a correction term that can be used  to eliminate the effect 
of uncertainties of closed-loop system ,

K  and 
p
K  are 
both respectively the 24× 24 velocity and position con-
trol gain matrices included to decrease the tracking error 
( ( ) ( ))de q t q t= − .  
 
Substituting (9) and (20) into (21) results in the fol-
lowing  error  dynamics: 
 
( ( ))[( ( ) ( )) ( ( ) ( )) ( ( ) ( ))]
