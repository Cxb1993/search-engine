Abstract 
This is the third year’s final report of subproject-3 of a three-year main project. The main aim 
of this subproject is to analyze the interface reliability of MEA and flow field plate during 
operating process, by using the numerical method, as well as evaluates bonding strength of the 
interface. In the first year, in order to study the reliability of flow field plate, the study is 
concentrated on predicting the stress distribution between the sputtered Ag layer and the SU8 
substrate of a micro-channel in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) through 
simulation of stress state and flow field in the channel. In the second year, the study is 
concentrated on predicting the 2-dimentional fracture behavior between the sputtered Ag layer and 
the SU8 substrate of the micro-channel. In the third year, the study extends the 2-dimentional 
fracture behavior studied in the second year to the 3-dimentional fracture behavior and the mode 
III stress intensity factor was included. A 3-dimensional model corresponding to a 3-dimensional 
partially cracked crack existed in the interface between the sputtered Ag layer and the SU8 
substrate of the micro-channel was set initially. Then the commercial package software ANSYS 
and Taguchi technique were adopted and the 3-dimensional stress fields around the crack tip were 
studied.  The efforts were concentrated on studying the effects of the variation of micro-channel 
size, the crack geometry and the gas inlet pressure on the flow induced stress states and SIF in a 
bimaterial interface.

1. Introduction 
Fuel cell is a new cell which uses 
Hydrogen and Oxygen as reactants and 
through chemical reactions can translate 
chemical energy into electrical energy. The 
most difference from a traditional battery is 
that the electrode of a fuel cell is not 
concentrated in chemical reactions. It plays the 
role of catalyst in the process. Unlike a 
traditional cell, fuel cell is an energy 
translation device not a deposition device. If 
we provide the reactants incessantly, a fuel cell 
will generate electric power unceasingly. The 
electrochemical reactions are：

Numerical analysis using contact finite 
elements is paid to the near crack-tip 
displacements and stresses. The comparison 
between finite element method and analytically 
determined stress is made. Bjerken and 
Persson [8] presented a method for obtaining 
the complex stress intensity factor for an 
interface crack in a bimaterial using a 
minimum number of computations. A crack 
closure integral method for homogenous 
materials developed by Rybicki and Kanninen 
had been modified to include mismatch in 
material properties. The main advantages of 
this method are that it is straightforward and 
easy to use and that the number of calculations 
needed to obtain the stress intensity factors can 
be held to a minimum. Ikeda and Miyazaki [9] 
presented an application of fracture mechanics 
to the interface crack between dissimilar 
materials. In their study, a concept of the stress 
intensity factors of an interface crack is 
discussed, and various types of specimens are 
tested experimentally for investigating the 
mixed mode fracture toughness criterion of an 
interface crack. The crack-tip-opening angle or 
displacement (CTOA/CTOD) fracture criterion 
is one of the oldest fracture criteria applied to 
fracture of metallic materials with cracks. The 
constant CTOA criterion (from crack initiation 
to failure) has been successfully applied to 
numerous structural applications, such as 
aircraft fuselages and pipelines. Newman, 
James and Zerbst [10] reviewed the results 
from several studies, discussed the issues of 
why CTOA worked, and discussed its 
limitations. Shah, Azram, and Iliyas [11] made 
three point bend bimaterial specimens of 
PMMA/PC by jointing the two materials using 
friction welding. Normal and shear stress were 
recorded for a series of nodes ahead of the 
crack tip at (θ=0). SIF values were calculated 
using these stress values and it was found that 
the stresses at a certain distance lying outside 
the process zone provide a SIF value matching 
to that of experimental fracture toughness of 
the specimen. Chien, Shih, Hsieh, Tsai, Lin, 
and Huang [12, 13] analyzed the effects of 
parameter variations of micro-channel on the 
cracked Ag-SU8 interface in a micro-PEMFC. 
The KI and KII stress intensity factors at the 
crack tip were analyzed for the different crack 
sizes and loadings by Taguchi method and 
ANOVA. The results showed that the inlet 
pressure and crack length affected the stress 
intensity factors more than the inlet velocity 
did. Also, the results showed that as the crack 
length increases, the value of KI would 
increase, but the value of KII decreases slightly. 
 
3. Research Objective 
The efficiency of the fuel cell depends 
on both the kinetics of the electrochemical 
process and performance of the components. 
In the first year, in order to study the 
reliability of flow field plate, the study is 
concentrated on predicting the stress 
distribution between the sputtered Ag layer 
and the SU8 substrate of a micro-channel in 
polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell 
(PEMFC) through simulation of stress state 
and flow field in the channel. In the second 
year, the study is concentrated on predicting 
the 2-dimentional fracture behavior between 
the sputtered Ag layer and the SU8 substrate 
of the micro-channel. In the third year, the 
study extends the 2-dimentional fracture

4.2 2-D and 3-D Stress Analyzed Model 
In order to know the stressed 
behavior of the full facture and of the 
partially cracked crack, 2-D and 3-D models 
were established to simulate the different 
fracture situation. Figure 5 shows the meshed 
composite layers of a full cracked crack with 
2-D model and Figure 6 shows the meshed 
composite layers of a partially cracked crack 
with 3-D model on the micro-channel wall. 
The wall layers were composed of sputtered 
Ag layer and SU8 substrate. The thickness of 
Ag and SU8 were 400×10-9 m and 200×10-6 
m, respectively. Material constants were 
chosen as EAg = 76GPa, GAg = 27.8GPa, ESU8 
= 5.63GPa, and GSU8 = 2.133GPa. Three 
different ANSYS®8.0 element types were 
chosen in 2-D model. They were SOLID45 
(Ag), INTER195 (Adhesion Layer), and 
SOLID45 (SU8) from top to bottom, 
respectively. SOLID PLANE 82 element was 
chosen to mesh around the crack tip. For 3-D 
model, element SOLID 95 was chosen as the 
singular element and meshed around the 
crack tip and element SOLID 185 was used 
to mesh the other part of the model. These 
two models were used for simulating the 
distribution of stresses in the interface with a 
small edge-crack on the tube wall. Table 1 
shows the material properties of Ag、SU8 and 
Hydrogen. [14] [15] [16].

The analysis is broken down into sums of 
squares that measure the variability due to the 
levels and due to the errors. The general form 
is, 
ELT SSSSSS +=                   (8) 
where SST= the total sum of squares, SSL= the 
sum of squares due to the levels, SSE= the sum 
of squares due to the errors. There are degrees

of squares. The degrees of freedom are given

6. Results and Discussions 
6.1 Effect of Flow Field in Different Cases 
The converge phenomena of the wall 
shear stress corresponding to two different 
channel lengths,1cm and 2cm, are compared. 
While the cases were executed, the other 
parameters were kept constant, viz. the channel 
width is 200µm, the crooked radius is 20µm, 
and the width between two legs is 100µm, and 
the inlet velocity is 200m/s. The distributions 
of shear stress at the right leg channel wall 
along the channel length are show in Figure 8 
and Figure 9. It is found that the converge 
length is 4×10-3m for 1×10-2 m channel length 
and is 8×10-3m for 2×10-2m channel length. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the 
converge length of wall shear stress is directly 
proportion to the channel length.

6.2 KΙ and KΙΙ correspond to different 
Material Property Proportions and 
Geometries 
The model consisted two kinds of 
material, sputtered layer (E1 = 76GPa, ν1 =0.37, 
G1=27.8GPa) and substrate (E2 = 5.63GPa, ν2 
=0.32, G2=2.133GP). The thicknesses of 
sputtered layer and substrate were 400×10-9m 
and 200×10-6m, respectively and sputtered 
layer was the upper layer. In order to study the 
effect of the proportion of material constants of 
these two materials on stress intensity factors, 
ten different sets of proportion of material 
constants of these two materials were chosen. 
E1 and ν1 were changed from 76GPa to 
5.63GPa and from 0.37 to 0.32, respectively; 
also, E2 and ν2 were changed from 5.63GPa to 
76GPa and from 0.32 to 0.37, respectively. 
Then the proportion of G1/G2 was varied from 
13.02 to 0.077. The crack lengths were chosen 
as 200, 400 and 600×10-9m. The wall shear 
stress loading and boundary condition kept the 
same in all cases. 
In this case, KΙΙΙ occurs between similar 
materials, so KΙΙΙ does not depend on material 
property proportion. Unlike KΙΙΙ, KΙ and KΙΙ 
occurred between dissimilar materials. 
Therefore, the effects of material property 
proportions on KΙ and KΙΙ were discussed. After 
analyses, it can be found that KΙ increased 
when ratio of G1 / G2 decreased as shown in 
Fig. 17. But when the ratio less than a critical 
value, KΙ becomes to decrease as the ratio 
decreases. Also, the critical value becomes 
smaller if crack length getting longer. However, 
KΙ increases when crack length increases as 
one expected.  
But an interesting phenomenon occurred 
when KΙΙ was discussed. It can be seen from 
Fig. 18 that KII increases as crack length 
increases as one may expect and decreases as 
G1 / G2 increases if the ratio of G1 / G2 is small 
enough. However, if the ratio of G1 / G2, i.e. 
Gsputtered layer/Gsubstrate, is larger than a critical 
 11
three-level OA (orthogonal array) for 
ANOVA was used in this paper. In this 
research, the flow field simulations were 
carried out to obtain the distributions of wall 
shear stress in the Micro-channel and the 
interfacial crack simulations are used to 
calculate the stress intensity factor in 
bimaterial. The L18 OA, corresponding to 
inlet velocity taking two levels but the other 
factors taking three levels, is shown in Table 
2. 
The summaries of the ANOVA results 
for stress intensity factor, KI and KII, are 
interpreting by using the F distribution 
relative to each other are shown in Table 3 
and Table 4, respectively. The largest KI is 
due to A1B3C3D1E3F3 which is the case of 
inlet velocity 150 m/s, inlet pressure 
303.9×103N/m2, crooked radius 40×10-6m, 
width between two legs 100×10-6m, channel 
width 300×10-6m, and crack length 60×10-8m 
as shown in Figure 21. The largest KII is due 
to A2B3C2D1E3F1 which is the case of inlet 
velocity 200 m/s, inlet pressure 
303.9×103N/m2, crooked radius 30×10-6m, 
width between two legs 100×10-6m, channel 
width 300×10-6m, and crack length 20×10-8m 
as shown in Figure 22. It can be seen in 
Table 4 that the significant factors for KI, 
corresponding to at least 95% confidence 
level, are inlet pressure (P=0.77%), channel 
width (P=11.50%), and crack length 
(P=79.27%), where P is the percent 
contribution. In Table 5, corresponding to at 
least 95% confidence level, the significant 
factors for KII are inlet pressure (P=10.98%), 
width between two legs (P=2.46%), channel 
width (P=80.46%), and crack length 
(P=2.85%). 
Two largest significant factors of KI are 
crack length and channel width, it might 
except that stress intensity factor has direct 
proportion with crack length and the 
cross-section area of channel has effects on the 
inlet pressure and velocity. Two largest 
significant factors of KII are channel width and 
inlet pressure, these two factors has effects on 
wall shear stress distribution in the 
Micro-channel and the major loading of KII is 
shear stress. That is reason that these two 
factors are the largest scales.

opening angle of crack 30°, the destruction 
of sliding mode would occur easily. It is 
shown in Figure 24. The maxima value of 
KΙΙΙ happened when parameters are selected

40×10-6m and opening angle of crack 10°, 
the destruction of tearing mode would occur 
easily. It is shown in Figure 25. 
Foe at least 95% confidence level, it 
can be seen in Table 6 that the significant 
factor for KΙ is opening angle (P=27.99%). In 
Table 7, for at least 95% confidence level, it 
can be found that crack length (P=64.58%) is 
the significant factor for KΙΙ. For at least 95% 
confidence level, ratio of Ag thickness and 
crack length (P=23.27%), width between two 
legs (P=19.07%), channel width (P=20.87%), 
crack length (P=17.3%) and opening angle 
(P=10.17%) are the significant factors for 
KΙΙΙ, it is shown in Table8.

6. Conclusions 
A computational model of a single 
crooked micro-channel for predicting the 
effects of channel parameters on the flow 
induced maximum wall shear stress of the 
micro-channel was developed initially. Then, 
the obtained results were adopted to study the 
2-dimensional stress fields and corresponding 
stress intensity factors, KI and KII, around the 
crack tip of an interfacial crack existed 
between the sputtered Ag layer and the SU8 
substrate of the micro-channel in a micro 
PEMFC. Finally, the 3-dimensional stress 
fields and corresponding stress intensity 
factors, KI, KII and KIII, around the crack tip of 
an interfacial partially cracked crack were 
studied. Simulations were performed by using 
the commercial package software ANSYS. The 
Taguchi technique was utilized to study the 
effects of the variation of micro-channel size, 
the crack geometry and the gas inlet pressure 
on the flow induced stress states and SIF in a 
bimaterial interface. Summarized the foregoing 
results, one can obtain following conclusions: 
1. Among studied parameters: channel 
length, crooked radius, gas inlet velocity, 
channel width, and width between two legs of 
the crooked channel, the channel width and gas 
inlet velocity would affect the maximum wall 
shear stress the most, which occurred at the 
crooked corner, mostly.  
2. By studying the stress intensity factors 
around the crack tip of a crack existed between 
the sputtered Ag layer and the SU8 substrate, it 
can be seen that as the value of material 
proportion, Gsputtered layer / Gsubstrate, far less than 
1, KΙI will increase as crack length increases as 
one may expect. However, after the material 
proportion greater than a critical value, KΙI will 
decrease as crack length increases. The thicker 
the thickness of sputtered layer is, the smaller 
the critical material proportion. 
3. Corresponding to the 2-dimensional 
stress fields analysis, it can be concluded that 
variations of hydrogen inlet velocities only 
affect the values of KI & KII slightly, but the
