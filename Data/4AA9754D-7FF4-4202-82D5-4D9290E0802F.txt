Running head: Effects of co-exposure to noise and solvents on synthetic leather 
workers’ ambulatory blood pressures and heart rates 
effect on SBP but it potentiates the effect of noise. The diastolic blood pressure was 
significantly higher in high-noise exposure groups or in high-chemical exposure 
groups than in the low-noise and low-chemical exposure group (G1:86.7±17.4 mmHg; 
G2:81.6±13.3 mmHg; G3:78.5±15.8 mmHg; G4:76.1±13.0 mmHg). Workers’ 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased with the level of noise or chemical 
exposure. However, only the high-noise and extremely low-chemical exposure group 
had the significantly higher heart rate than the low-noise and extremely low-chemical 
exposure group during the working period (G2:85.3±14.2 BPM; G4:76.2±12.2 BPM). 
Conclusions: Co-exposure of noise, DMF and TOL can affect the ambulatory blood 
pressure and heart rate among synthetic leather workers. Noise exposure may have 
obviously higher effect than chemical exposure. 
 
Key words: occupational noise, n, n-dimethylformamide, toluene, ambulatory blood 
pressure, heart rate, co-exposure 
 
occupational noise exposure in the manufacturing processes. Noise exposure can pose 
potential adverse health effects, including hearing impairment, annoyance, sleep 
disturbance, and hypertension. Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated the 
relationship between occupational noise exposure and hypertension. In the sustained 
effect of noise exposure, higher blood pressures were reported among industrial 
workers with a noise-induced auditory impairment15, assembly-line workers16, male 
workers exposed to noise levels exceeding 80 dBA17, shipyard workers18, and textile- 
mill workers19. Talbott et al. conducted the first study to support the evidence for a 
dose-response relationship between occupational noise and blood pressure20. Tomei 
and his colleges suggested occupational noise is a cardiovascular risk factor and 
cardiovascular effects are relative to intensity and type of exposure21. In the transient 
effect of noise exposure, Green et al. found average ambulatory systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were higher in workers exposed to 
noise level ≥ 85 dBA than those exposed to noise level < 85 dBA22. Fogari et al. 
found transient but not sustained blood pressure increments by occupational noise 
above 85 dBA among metallurgical workers23. In our previous study, we found a 
transient increase of SBP in occupational noise exposure at one-hour lag time during 
work and the significant difference of SBP in sleep time between high-exposure (≥ 85 
dBA) and low-exposure (<59 dBA) groups among automobile workers24. 
Methods 
Subjects 
This study was conducted in a synthetic leather manufacturing company with 75 
employees in Taiwan in 2005. We first performed the walk-through evaluation and 
determined environmental noise in the field under the agreement of this company and 
employees. Major operations in this factory included pilot researches for 
sample-manufacturing tests, solvents mixing and dyeing, non-woven fabric 
manufacturing, wet processes and dry processes for synthetic leather, extra processing 
(such as printing, pressing, surface arrangement, and inspection, etc.), and DMF waste 
recycling. The measured environmental noise in the workplace was between 80-90 
dBA. The humidity and temperature in this factory were 60% and 40?. These 75 
employees were classified to seven similar exposure groups based on potential 
physical and chemical hazards in the field and their specified tasks, including 7 
researchers, 9 workers in the non-woven fabric manufacturing, 15 workers in the wet 
processes, 12 workers in the dry processes, 5 workers in the extra processing 
development, and 4 workers charged for DMF waste recycling, and 23 office workers. 
We recruited 30 volunteers from 44 employees as study subjects because 10 foreign 
labors and 21 off-duty workers with shift work were excluded in this study.  
Health examination 
than one time for at least half year. Cigarette smokers were defined as 
having smoked cigarettes more than 3 days per week for at least 6 months. 
The alcohol, tea, and coffee drinkers were also used the same definition. 
The Institutional Review Board of the College of Public Health, China Medical 
University, approved this study, and a written informed consent was obtained from 
each participating worker. 
Ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate monitoring and recording 
We recorded each subject’s ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate every 30 
minutes in the wake time (08:00 a.m.-11:00 p.m.) and every 60 minutes in the sleep 
time (11:00 p.m.-08:00 a.m.) continuously by using a portable, non-invasive, 
automated monitoring and recording system (DynaPulse model 5000A, Pulse Metric, 
San Diego, California, USA). The DynaPulse system can measure a subject’s arterial 
pulsation signals, known as the arterial waveform, through a non-invasive cuff device. 
The systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings by DynaPulse have been validated 
against the traditional mercury sphygmomanometer measurements31, 32. Each subject 
carried a Dynapulse system for 24 hours to complete his continuous monitoring of 
blood pressure and heart rate. The upper detection of blood pressure was setup at 180 
mmHg to avoid disturbance due to specific events during the study period. All of 30 
participants’ blood pressure and heart rate measurements during the working period 
the sampling flow rate in the range of 50 mL/min to 100 mL/min around the breathing 
zone. A charcoal tube (cat. No. 226-01; SKC, Eighty Four, PA) was used as sampling 
media to collect DMF and coexisting TOL solvents. We used a Perkin-Elmer 
autosystem XL gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector 
(Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Inc., Boston, MA) and a fused silica 
WCOT DB-WAX (30 m×0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm film thickness) separation column (J & 
W Scientific, Folsom, CA) to analyze airborne samples. The details for sample storage, 
pretreatment, and analyses were described in the previous study3. 
According to the personal measurements of noise, DMF, and TOL exposure, 30 
study subjects were classified to four exposure groups, including the high-noise (≥80 
dBA) and low-chemical (the TLV of mixtures ≥0.1) group (G1, n=9), the high-noise 
and extremely low-chemical group (G2, n=6), the low-noise and low-chemical group 
(G3, n=7), and the low-noise and extremely low-chemical group (G4, n=8). 
Statistical analysis 
We performed univariate comparisons between the four exposure groups by 
using ANOVA analyses and Scheffes’ poster tests for continuous variables. The 
Chi-square tests and Fisher’s exact tests were conducted to compare the 
group-difference for dichotomous variables. We used linear mixed-effects regression 
models to associate transient noise exposure with blood pressure and heart rate by 
Results 
Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics and health risk factors by 
coexposure levels for 30 study subjects. The average age of these 4 groups ranged 
from 34 to 40 years and their average BMI was between 22-25 kg/m2. The mean 
values of resting SBP and DBP for these 4 groups ranged 131-141 mmHg and 66-83 
mmHg, respectively. Their average levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride were 
176-213 mg/dL and 77-179 mg/dL, respectively. There were significant differences 
between three exposure groups (G1-G3) and the reference group (G4) for age, BMI, 
resting SBP, total cholesterol and triglyceride (p<0.05). Only high-noise exposure 
groups (G1 and G2) had the statistically higher mean of the resting DBP than the 
reference group. In the lifestyle of health risks for these 4 groups, only the G1 and G3 
groups had the significant difference of coffee consumption compared to the reference 
group. Although the G1 group had the marginally significant difference of smoking, 
there was no statistically significant between-group difference in other 5 risk factors, 
including regular exercise, working activity, alcohol drinking, tea consumption, and 
hypertension family. 
The 24-hour graphs of concurrent mean measurements of noise exposure, SBP, 
DBP, and HR for different co-exposure workers is shown in Figure 1. The average 
noise exposure of the G1 and G2 groups was almost above 80 dBA and consistently 
hours, the 10-hour working period, the 5-hour off-duty period and the 9-hour sleep 
period for workers with different co-exposure to noise and chemicals during the study. 
As expected, personal noise exposure levels of two high exposure workers (G1 and 
G2) were significantly higher than those of two low exposure workers (G3 and G4) 
during the working period. The average noise levels of these 4 groups were 81.6 ± 6.3 
dBA for the G1 group, 81.2 ± 9.4 dBA for the G2 group, 74.9 ± 11.0 dBA for the G3 
group, and 73.2 ± 12.2 dBA for the G4 group, respectively. By contrast, the average 
noise levels during the off-duty and the sleep periods had no significant difference 
between these 4 exposure groups. Additionally, personal TLV levels of co-exposure to 
DMF and TOL among two low exposure workers (G1 and G3) were significantly 
higher than those of two extremely low exposure workers (G2 and G4) during the 
working period. The average TLV levels of mixtures were 5.4 ± 2.1 for the G1 group, 
0.5 for 1 of the G2 group, 2.4 ± 1.6 for the G3 group, and 0.43 for 2 of the G4 group, 
respectively. 
The G1 workers’ SBP were significantly higher than the G4 workers’ ones by 
averaging 10.9 mmHg over 24 hours, 13.8 mmHg over the working period, and 11.3 
mmHg over the off-duty period. The G2 workers’ SBP were also significantly higher 
than the G4 workers’ ones by averaging 6.7 mmHg, 8.5 mmHg, and 8.5 mmHg over 
24 hours, the working period, and the off-duty period, respectively. The G3 workers’ 
models showed workers’ SBP increased transiently at concurrent, 1 hour, 2 hours and 
3 hours after noise exposure at work. Our models showed that 1 dBA increase in noise 
exposure for synthetic leather workers poses significant increments of SBP with 0.33 
mmHg, 0.56 mmHg, 0.79 mmHg, and 1.27 mmHg after the current, 1 hour, 2 hour, 
and 3 hour occupational exposure, respectively. We found that workers’ DBP had the 
marginal increase transiently at concurrent, 1 hour, 2 hours after noise exposure 
during the working period. But there was a significant increase of 0.5 mmHg DBP at 
180-minute lag for 1 dBA increase in noise exposure for synthetic leather workers. 
The mixed-effects models also showed workers’ HR increased significantly at 60 and 
120 minutes and returned to marginal significance at 180 minutes after noise exposure 
at work. Our models showed that 1 dBA increase in noise exposure for synthetic 
leather workers poses significant increments of HR with 0.19 BPM and 0.29 BPM 
after the 60 minutes and 120 minutes occupational exposure, respectively. 
The association between co-exposure groups and ambulatory blood pressure and 
heart rate over 24-hour, the working period, the off-duty period, and the sleep period 
is summarized in Table 3. We observed that three co-exposure groups (G1, G2, and 
G3) were significantly associated with workers’ SBP over 24 hours after controlling 
other risk factors (βG1=17.6±4.1; βG2=10.0±3.1; βG3=7.3±3.3). Other risk factors 
associated with workers’ 24-hour SBP including age, BMI, coffee consumption, and 
controlling other risk factors (βG2=7.8±2.9). Other risk factors related to workers’ HR 
during the working period were the age and cigarette smoking.  
Our models revealed that three co-exposure groups (G1, G2, and G3) were 
significantly associated with workers’ SBP during the off-duty period after controlling 
other risk factors (βG1=19.3±6.4; βG2=13.0±4.8; βG3=10.7±5.0). Additionally, we also 
identified that off-duty-time SBP were significantly increased for workers with age, 
coffee consumption, and working activity. We also found that these three groups were 
significantly associated with workers’ DBP during the off-duty period after 
controlling other risk factors (βG1=10.9±5.1; βG2=8.4±3.8; βG3=11.8±4.0). Only the 
coffee consumption of other risk factors was significantly associated with workers’ 
DBP during the off-duty period. However, there was no variable significantly 
associated with workers’ HR during the off-duty period after controlling other risk 
factors. 
We did not observe any exposure group was significantly associated with 
workers’ SBP, DBP, and HR during the sleep period after controlling other risk factors. 
Only the coffee consumption related to workers’ sleep-time SBP and cigarette 
smoking related to workers’ sleep-time DBP were found after controlling other risk 
factors. 
 
Our findings suggested the transient effects of increasing SBP and DBP could be 
induced by noise exposure at lower noise levels and the following time lags. Previous 
studies found that industrial noise exposure above 85 dBA had a transient effect of 
increasing SBP and DBP22-23. Our study reported such a transient effect could also 
occur at noise levels as low as 80 dBA. We also found that the transient effect of noise 
exposure on SBP had the lagged effect from 1 hour to maximally 3 hours, which was 
consistent with our previous study maximally at 1-hour24 and other one reported 2 or 
3 persistent hours23. However, such transient effect only can retain to cause the 
increments of SBP and DBP over the off-duty time but not over the sleep time. The 
reason may be the between-group difference of noise exposure with 6-8 dBA in this 
study was not great enough to cause the sustained effect over the sleep time as one of 
26 dBA reported in our previous study24. This phenomenon was consistent with the 
findings of the Fogari et al. study, which the increasing SBP and DBP was observed 
during the working and off-duty periods but not during the sleep period among 
workers expose to noise above 85 dBA compared to those below 80 dBA during the 
working day23. 
Increasing 24-hour average of ambulatory SBP and the resting SBP among 
synthetic leather workers indicated that co-exposure to noise, DMF, and TOL could 
also have a dose-response and sustained effect on blood pressure. We believed that 
monitoring ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate continuously instead of using 
one single measurement of noise exposure and resting blood pressure to investigate 
the transient and sustained effects of noise exposure on SBP and DBP in this study.  
Although the number of study subjects classified to four co-exposure groups was 
small, the numbers of valid measurements of noise exposure, blood pressure, and 
heart rate were relatively large. There were 822 valid blood pressure and heart rate 
measurements and 8246 personal noise data sets during the 30 study subjects’ 24-hour 
monitoring period. Accordingly, a small number of study subjects with a large time 
series data sample size would not affect the determination of transient effect but might 
limit the extrapolation of the sustained effect observed among synthetic leather 
workers in this study to the workers in other industrial settings. 
One limitation of this study is the problem of missing data, which existed in 
blood pressure and heart rate measurements but not in noise exposure measurements. 
Because the DynaPulse system is based on measuring a subject’s arterial waveform to 
report blood pressure and heart rate, it is sensitive to the subject’s arm movements. 
The heavy dynamic exercises during working hours and frequent changes of body 
posture during sleep period are two possible reasons of missing data for blood 
pressure and heart rate measurements. Different in these activities between subjects 
resulted in inconsistent distribution of missing data of blood pressure across different 
between the groups of importance for the development of elevated blood pressure 
were not completely excluded, our findings generally supported the conclusion that 
there was transient effect and sustained effects in normotensive adult synthetic leather 
workers at occupational co-exposure to noise, DMF, and TOL. For the transient effect, 
a 1-dBA increase in noise exposure was significantly associated with 0.33-mm Hg 
increase in SBP, and marginally associated with 0.14-mmHg increase in DBP for 
synthetic leather workers, respectively. For the sustained effect, a dose-response 
increase in 24-hour SBP was significantly associated with co-exposure to noise, DMF, 
and TOL at work. Such findings are particularly important for an aging working 
population because blood pressure control was key to promoting adult worker’s health. 
After finding out these situations in the workplace, we recommend this company 
providing hearing protection devices to employers immediately even where the noise 
exposure was not exceeded the requirement of 8-hour TWA of 85dBA in Taiwan. We 
also recommend conducting further studies on mechanism of blood pressure in 
relation to co-exposure to noise and solvent among synthetic leather workers.
