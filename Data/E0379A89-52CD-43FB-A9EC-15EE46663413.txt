Abstract 
The purpose of applying pulse width 
modulation (PWM) voltage-source rectifier (VSRs) 
is to supply steady dc power with unity power 
factor for motor drives and other DC loads. A 
suitable control algorithm for PWM may achieve 
high power factor, low harmonic distortion in 
current, fast dynamical response, bidirectional 
power transfer and zero steady-state error. 
Although the control technique of six-switch 
voltage-source rectifier has become mature, the 
cost and reliability are always important issues. 
Hence, it is desirable to develop high performance 
voltage-source rectifiers with less switches. This 
project aims to perform modelling and advance 
nonlinear control of a four-switch VSR in the d-q 
synchronous frame. At present, control methods 
for this type of rectifier are mainly hysteresis and 
steady-state control schemes which do not take the 
transient specifications into account. Using d-q 
frame model in control design has the advantage 
of simplifying the sinusoidal tracking problem to a 
set-point reference regulation problem, hence 
many advance linear/nonlinear control methods 
become applicable. This is beneficial in designing 
a controller to achieve fast transient response. In 
this regard, this project introduces a control design 
approach in rotating d-q frame for the four-switch 
PWM VSRs. For this purpose, a mathematical 
model of the four-switch PWM VSR in rotating 
d-q frame is first derived. The success is relied on 
performing a so-called “reduced Park 
Transformation” on switching functions. Then, the 
input-output feedback linearization (IOFL) is 
applied to design the controllers for the d and q 
current loops. The effectiveness of the IOFL 
controller is verified via computer simulation and 
hardware experiment. Responses of the LPI d-q 
and a-b-c frame controllers originated from the 
six-switch VSR are also documented for 
comparative study. Test results evidence the 
 3
usual practice, an outer-loop LPI voltage 
controller cascaded to the d-axis current loop is 
adopted to cope with the issue of voltage 
regulation. 
The performance of the proposed controller 
designs is validated through computer simulation 
and hardware experiment. To give a comparison, 
simulated and experimental results of the d-q and 
a-b-c frame LPI current controllers [3] migrated 
from six-switch VSR are also provided to 
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IOFL 
controller in synchronous rotating d-q frame. 
三、研究方法 
I. System Modelling in Rotating d-q Frame 
A. Coordinate Transformation 
The Park Transformation converts the three 
phase system from a stationary reference frame 
into synchronously rotating frame with direct, 
quadrature and zero-sequence components. In this 
coordinates, as the d-axis is aligned with source 
supply voltage, the unity-power-factor 
requirement can be achieved by simply regulating 
the q-axis source current to zero. There are some 
variants of the Park Transformation. This project 
considers the following transformation matrix

 For describing the d-q frame model of a

B. Modelling in Rotating d-q Frame 
 The schematic diagram of a three-phase 
four-switch VSR under consideration is shown in 
Fig. 1. It is assumed that a resistive load LR  is 
connected to the output terminal. Also, the two 
series-connected output capacitors are identical 
(i.e. CCC == 21 ). As demonstrated in [15], the 
a-b-c frame state equations of the four-switch 
VSR are

VSR. As using two identical capacitors in the 
capacitor bank, it is reasonably to assume that 1cv  
is equal to 2cv  if the imperfection of the 
capacitors is ignored. Then, a wealth of analytical 
and control methods for the six-switch VSR may 
be directly applied to the four-switch VSR. 
C. Steady State Solution 
 The d-q frame model derived in Section Ia for 
four-switch VSRs is a two-input nonlinear systems. 
With a resistive load LR  connected at dc output, 
as dc-bus voltage, ov , reaches a given desired 
setting *oV  with a unity power factor, the 
steady-state solution may be found as follows. 
 Since the two series-connected output capacitors 
are identical, it is further assumed that

 Let du , qu  and *dI  represent the steady-state 
values of the switching functions du , qu  and 
d-axis current, respectively. Then substituting 
these steady-state values into the d-q frame model 
of the VSR (26)-(28) yields

 It can then be checked that the steady-state

In [10], it has been shown that the larger solution 
in (37) is not a stable equilibrium point and hence 
not feasible. 
II. Nonlinear Current Controller Design 
 The expressions (26)-(28) indicate that the 
dynamics of a four-switch VSR are nonlinear and 
bear a resemblance to that of a six-switch VSR. In 
fact, when 21 cc vv = , they are almost identical. 
Thus many existing control strategies (for example, 
see [7]-[14]) may be adopted to design a controller 
that could exhibit satisfactory performance. Due to 
the non-minimum phase property [22], the control 
of VSRs is usually accomplished in a cascaded 
structure as shown in Fig. 2. The inner loop 
performs current control and the outer-loop 
voltage controller generates a current reference for 
the inner current loops. 
 The input-output feedback linearization 
([9]-[10], [13], [22]) provides an effective means 
to transforming original system into a linear one 
under which regular linear controller design can 
be applied. In [10], the author has given a 
thorough analysis on the geometric properties of 
the six-switch VSR and discovered that the 
so-called voltage control, with output variables 
chosen to be ov  and  di , leads to a 
non-minimum phase system, and thus not feasible. 
Instead, the feedback linearization is considered 
for the d- and q-axis current dynamics (26)-(27). 
 By equating the right hand sides of (26) and (27) 
with  )()( ∫ −+− dtiikiik *ddid*ddpd and 
 7
current controllers, load steps are conducted 
between light load ( LR =100Ω) to heavy load 
( LR =50Ω) with a fixed dc voltage reference set at 
180V. Despite the LPI-SF current controller is 
implemented in the stationary a-b-c frame, the 
measured line-current waveforms are transformed 
to rotating d-q frame for the convenience of 
evaluation of the control performance. The 
simulated waveforms of the IOFL, LPI-DQ and 
LPI-SF controllers are shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and 
Fig. 7, respectively. For comparison, the 
line-current waveforms of the three controllers are 
depicted in Fig. 8. These waveforms will be 
further evidenced via hardware experiments in the 
following section. Analysis and discussion about 
these results will also be given. 
B. Experimental Setup 
A laboratory prototype, with the same circuit 
parameters as in the case of simulation, was built 
for practical verification of the performance of the 
proposed controllers. Figure 4 shows a diagram of 
the hardware experiment. The gating signals for 
the four IBGT switches are generated via 
sinusoidal PWM strategy. The PWM carrier 
frequency swf = 10kHz and amplitude of the 
PWM carrier V 10=vtk . The d-axis current 
command, *di , that corresponds to the output of 
outer-loop PI controller is limited to within [-18, 
18] to prevent the damage of circuit devices from 
over current. A Chroma 61702 three-phase ac 
power supply is used to provide balanced and high 
quality ac source. 
The control algorithm is digitally realized with 
a sampling frequency 10kHz, corresponding to a 
sampling period sT =100μs, on a DSP 
development system manufactured by dSPACE™.  
This developing platform contains a DS1104 PPC 
controller board and real time interface (RTI) that 
enables programming in Matlab/Simulink™ 
environment. The controller board is equipped 
with a PowerPC 603e processor running at a clock 
speed of 250 MHz and necessary in/out interfaces 
for implementing the control scheme. The 
zero-order Euler approximation is adopted to 
digitize the control algorithm. To give a fair 
comparison, in implementing the IOFL and 
LPI-DQ current controllers, only ai  and bi  are 
sensed for feedback. The c-phase current is then 
obtained from the relation: )( bac iii +−= . 
C. Experimental Results and Discussion 
As in the case of simulation, the experimental 
results of the three controllers: IOFL, LPI-DQ and 
LPI-SF, are documented for the case of step 
changes in load.  A hardware configuration of the 
control scheme in d-q frame is shown in Fig. 4. 
The experimental waveforms of the IOFL, 
LPI-DQ and LPI-SF controllers are shown in Fig. 
9, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, respectively. For 
comparison, the responses of line-current and 
dc-bus voltage of the three controllers are depicted 
in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, respectively. 
As comparing these waveforms to those 
obtained in simulation, a good agreement is found. 
In view of the transient responses of the dc-bus 
voltages for the three controllers, a voltage drop 
about 18 volts is measured and a fast recover in 
about 0.2 second in the dc voltage is observed. It 
is concluded that the three controllers exhibits 
almost identical performance. This would be no 
surprise since these controllers are equipped with 
the same type of voltage controller in the outer 
loop. As regard to current tracking performance, 
current waveforms of Fig. 9 show that the IOFL 
current controller is able to render decoupled 
dynamics. In contrast, both LPI-DQ and LPI-SF 
current controllers exhibit coupled behaviors at the 
instants when step change in load occurs, as 
displayed in Fig. 10-11. 
On the other hand, the control approach in d-q 
frame can effectively regulate the d- and q-axis 
current components to prespecified dc quantities. 
This leads to small ripples in d- and q-axis current 
components, and yields a more balanced input line 
currents (cf. Fig. 9-12). The phase currents are 
in-phase with input phase voltage as shown in Fig. 
12(a)-(b). 
In contrast, for the LPI-SF scheme, as LPI 
controller can not eliminate steady state error in 
tracking sinusoidal reference, there exist small 
tracking errors in the a- and b-phase input currents. 
Since )( bac iii +−= , a significantly unbalanced 
in line currents is then resulted as shown in Fig. 
12(c). Also, a small phase difference between 
a-phase voltage and current also exists, which 
indicates that phase tracking error is not zero. In 
view of Fig. 9-11, the tracking errors in both 
amplitudes and phases of the line currents of the 
LPI-SF controller also render significant 
variations in d- and q-axis currents as compared to 
those of IOFL and LPI-RF controllers. Larger 
ripples in dc-bus voltage are also observed in the 
 9
