ternary,2 quaternary,3 and pentanary 
semiconductor films. The heterojunction bipolar 
transistor was introduced in the 1980s and first 
appeared as an AlGaAs/GaAs combination. 
Currently, there is great interest in epitaxial 
InGaP material system lattice-matched to GaAs 
substrates for different device applications.4,5 
InGaP can be utilized to replace AlGaAs in high 
electron mobility transistors because it 
eliminates the problems associated with the DX 
centers and has great etching selectivity to GaAs. 
Ternary and quaternary alloys have become 
increasing important in the fabrication of 
electronic and optoelectronic devices. In 
particular, the use of quaternary III-V alloys for 
semiconductor devices has become extensive. 
This is due to the flexibility offered in 
quaternary alloys to select both energy band gap 
and lattice constant, independently. 
In0.5(AlXGa1-X)0.5/GaAs material system has the 
largest bandgap difference among all III-V 
semiconductor heterojunctions lattice-matched 
to GaAs. This material has been widely used to 
fabricate laser diodes5 and light emitting diodes 
emitting6 in the visible spectral region. It has 
been reported that the valence band discontinuity 
ΔEV at the In0.5(AlXGa1-X)0.5/GaAs 
heterojunction increases linearly with increasing 
Al composition, and reaches a maximum value 
(ΔEV=0.62 eV) at the In0.5Al0.5P/GaAs interface.7 
The value of ΔEV between InAlGaP and GaAs is 
very large. The large emitter-base ΔEV at 
InAlGaP/GaAs heterojunction can further reduce 
the reverse injection of holes into the emitter. 
The valence band discontinuity is, therefore, 
more favorable for n-p-n HBTs than in the case 
of AlGaAs/GaAs and InGaP/GaAs. Furthermore, 
although the value of ΔEC for In0.5Ga0.5P/GaAs 
heterojunction is still controversial, evidence 
shows that the incorporation of Al can increase 
ΔEC. According to Watanabe et al.,7 the value of 
ΔEC for In0.5(AlXGa1-X)0.5/GaAs heterojunction 
has the maximum value at x=0.7. Although the 
increasing emitter-base ΔEV can effectively 
suppress reverse injection of holes into the 
emitter even at high current levels, the increasing 
ΔEC impedes the electrons. The potential spike 
can be smoothed out by grading the composition 
in the depletion region of the E-B junction.8,9 
Nevertheless, both parabolic and linear grading 
compositions are not applicable to 
In(Al)GaP/GaAs and difficult to precisely 
control for AlGaAs/GaAs. Many methods, such 
as heterostructure-emitter bipolar transistors 
(HEBTs),2,10 and HBTs with thick spacers,11 
have been used to eliminate the spike. However, 
both techniques result in charge storage, 
decreasing the current gain, especially at low 
current densities. A similar concept to realize a 
tunable barrier height by a doping has been 
reported previously.12,13 However, there is no 
report on δ doping in InAlGaP/GaAs HBTs. In 
this paper, the application of δ-doping technique 
in an InAlGaP/GaAs HBT is demonstrated. With 
δ-doped sheet charge, a lower barrier height and 
a thinner barrier width is attained, when the 
doping plane is located close to the interface. 
δ-InAlGaP/GaAs HBT may be an attractive 
alternative to AlGaAs/GaAs and InGaP/GaAs 
HBTs, since estimates of the band alignment 
reveal that it is ideal for fabricating n-p-n HBTs.

with respect to the collector current. Both values 
were limited by the current capability of the 
power supply (100 mA). The current gain β for 
these two transistors was found to decrease 
markedly at low current levels.  
This influence that the delta-doping layer 
exerts on the transport of electrons across the 
emitter-base junction in our test structures can be 
best revealed by examining the offset voltages. 
The offset voltage ΔVCE can be given as15
