1very critical, since it directly affects the number and
position of the resulting hyperboxes. Consequently, it
influences the structure of the fuzzy classifier and the
classification performance so that this approach
suffers from a high sensitivity of the classification
accuracy with respect to the skill of the user to
determine the appropriate learning parameter. Besides,
the fixed learning parameter of the above approach to
fuzzy min-max hyperbox classifier makes the same
constraint on coverage resolution in the whole input
space so that some small hyperboxes are generated
even in the input space far from class boundaries. This
reduces the generalization capability of the fuzzy
min-max hyperbox classifier.
This paper proposes a supervised learning
method to generate min-max hyperboxes for
classifying the training patterns so that the fuzzy
min-max hyperbox classifier is constructed. The
proposed supervised learning method can learn the
behavior of the training patterns to generate relevant
fuzzy rules so that the generated fuzzy classifier can
classify the training patterns absolutely correctly.
However, a fuzzy classifier with a perfect rate of
recognition of training patterns also learns the
behavior of the noisy training patterns so that the
fuzzy classifier normally suffers from overfitting.
Consequently, the generalization ability of the
constructed fuzzy classifier will be low. In order to
overcome this drawback, the support vector machine
(SVM) [5,6] is applied to remove the noisy patterns so
that the fuzzy min-max hyperbox classifier has the
good generalization ability.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents the structure of the proposed fuzzy
min-max hyperbox classifier. Section 3 constructs a
fuzzy min-max hyperbox classifier with a good
generalization ability using a hybrid of an SVM and a
supervised learning method. Section 4 considers the
classification problems of the iris set to illustrate the
learning ability and the generalization ability of the
proposed approach. Finally, Section 5 draws
conclusions about the proposed approach to solving
the classification problem.
2. Structure of the fuzzy min-max
hyperbox classifier
This work addresses the construction of a fuzzy
min-max hyperbox classifier to solve an M-class
pattern classification problem. Assume that the pattern
space is the n-dimensional unit cube nI . Hence, the
pattern vector in the pattern classification problem is
an n-dimensional vector nn Ixxxa  ),,,( 21  . The
input of the fuzzy classifier must be transformed into
the complement coding form of the pattern vector

where ljR is the label of the fuzzy rule; x is the

The membership function in Fig. 1 indicates that if a
pattern vector falls inside the hyperbox, then the value
of the membership function of the pattern vector is
close to one. However, if the pattern vectors fall
outside the hyperbox, then the membership function
value decreases as it moves further away from the
hyperbox. Hence, the membership function is used to
represent the degree to which a pattern vector is
similar to the corresponding hyperbox fuzzy set. A
fuzzy reasoning method based on a single winner rule
is applied in the fuzzy min-max hyperbox classifier to
determine the output class of the input pattern vector
x . Assume that the input pattern vector is classified
by the single winner rule LJR , defined by

The J-th hyperbox associated with class L is the
winning hyperbox for the input pattern vector.
Consequently, the input pattern vector belongs to class
L. In the following section, the proposed approach is
applied to generate hyperboxes for training patterns,
and then the fuzzy min-max hyperbox classifier is
constructed to obtain a good generalization
performance.

4. Simulation Results
In this section, the iris data set is employed to
examine the learning ability and the generalization
ability of the proposed fuzzy min-max hyperbox
classifier. The Iris data set [3] contains 150 patterns
with four features, that belong to three classes (Iris
Setosa, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica). The four
features are 1) the sepal length in cm, 2) the sepal
width in cm, 3) the petal length in cm and 4) the petal
width in cm. The data set contains three classes, each
of 50 patterns; each class refers to a type of iris plant.
One class is linearly separable from the other two; the
latter are not linearly separable from each other. In the
following simulations of the proposed approach to the
iris data set, two parameters },{ C in the SVM
procedure were set to be {100,0.4}.
In order to examine the learning ability for
training patterns, we used all the 150 training patterns
as training patterns. Following the SVM procedure,
three noisy patterns are found. Then, the remaining
147 training patterns are used in the supervised
learning method and then generate 10 min-max
hyperboxes to construct a fuzzy min-max hyperbox
classifier. In Table 1, the simulation results of the
proposed approach are compared with those of the
other classification system described in [15].
Furthermore, two-fold cross validation (2CV) and
leaving one out (LV1) were employed to examine the
generalization ability of the proposed approach to
classifying the iris data. In the 2CV procedure, the iris
data are separated into two subsets of the same size.
That is, each subset consists of 75 patterns. One subset
is used as training data to construct the fuzzy min-max
hyperbox classifier. The other subset is used as test
data to evaluate the generated fuzzy min-max
hyperbox classifier. The same training-and-testing
procedure is also followed after the roles of the
subsets are exchanged with each other. Simulation
results of the proposed approach to classifying the Iris
data using the 2CV method are summarized in Table 2.
Table 3 compares our results with the results in [15]
for the classification of the Iris data using the same
2CV method. In the LV1 procedure, one pattern is
selected from the iris data set as a testing pattern, and
the other 149 patterns are used as training patterns.
Then, generate the fuzzy min-max hyperbox classifier
by using the training patterns, and classify the testing
pattern. Repeat this procedure 150 times until each of
all the patterns in the iris data set is selected as a
testing pattern, and calculate the average classification
rate for testing patterns. Simulation results of the
proposed approach to classifying the Iris data using
the LV1 method are summarized in Table 4. Table 5
compares our results with the results in [15] for the
classification of the Iris data using the same LV1
method. From the simulation results for the iris data
set, the proposed fuzzy min-max hyperbox classifier
outperforms the other fuzzy classification systems
described in [15].
5. Conclusions
This work presents a fuzzy min-max hyperbox
classifier with a complement coding form for
representing input patterns using a hybrid SVM and
supervised learning approach. In the proposed learning
method, some hyperboxes associated with each class
are generated to cover the training patterns in that
class. Then, each generated hyperbox is represented as
a fuzzy set such that a fuzzy min-max hyperbox
classifier can be constructed to classify all the training
patterns correctly. However, the perfect rate of
classification of the training patterns also learns the
behavior of noisy training patterns. A SVM procedure
of removing some noisy patterns from the training set
is used to design the fuzzy hyperbox min-max
classifier with a good generalization ability.
Simulation results are used to illustrate that the
learning method of the proposed approach is quite
effective in solving classification problems. This work
will be published in Journal of the Chinese Institute of
Engineers (SCI), Vol. 29, No. 5, pp. 791-799, 2006.
