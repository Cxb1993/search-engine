2.英文摘要  
    To address the high-pressure hydro- gen 
production system, this work develops a CO2 reformer 
to consume carbon dioxide, which is produced from 
the steam methane reforming (SMR) process. In the 
proposed system configuration, the performance of 
hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction is 
verified by the Aspen HYSYS

 simulator. The optimal 
heat exchanger network (HEN) design is implemented 
to achieve the target of maximum heat recovery of the 
heat-integrated system. Moreover, the annual total cost 
for the HEN superstructure is evaluated. 
3. Introduction 
     Cost-effective hydrogen production and CO2 
capture are required for a hydrogen economy [1]. 
About 95% of the hydrogen produced in the U.S. is 
obtained using a thermal process with natural gas as 
the feedstock. The conventional process primarily 
consists of two steps Xu and Fromen [2] namely the 
reformation of the feedstock with high-temperature 
steam to obtain a syngas and a water gas shift reaction 
that produces hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and residual 
materials. A small amount of carbon monoxide may 
poison fuel cell electrodes. Wu and Pai [3] conducted a 
selective oxidation reaction of carbon monoxide in a 
preferential oxidation reactor to reduce the 
concentration of carbon monoxide, but the process 
consumed hydrogen. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) 
technology has been utilized to achieve the separation 
of CO, CO2, CH4, and H2O from H2, allowing 
hydrogen to be purified to 99.999%. 
 Since hydrogen production plants generate CO2, 
most of them use a CO2 capture system to reduce their 
emissions of CO2 [4]. Schemes for reducing the 
emissions of greenhouse gases include a 
monoethanolamine (MEA) CO2 scrubbing process and 
cardo polyimide hollow fiber membrane capture. 
However, an external source of electricity is required 
for these separation processes. Koumpouras et al. [5] 
used CO2 adsorbent for a low-temperature hydrogen 
production process. The effective surface area of the 
adsorbent particles dominated the adsorption rate. 
Nord et al. [6] proposed pre-combustion CO2 capture 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Song and Pan [7] 
presented a configuration for tri-reforming methane, 
which involved CO2 reforming, steam reforming and 
the partial oxidation of methane, to enhance CO2 
conversion and utilization. Fan et al. [8] utilized 
greenhouse gases as the feed of the catalytic carbon 
dioxide reforming process to improve hourly space 
velocity and hydrogen production. Fan et al. [9] also 
studied the optimization of hydrogen production from 
the CO2 reforming of methane. Wang and Cao [10] 
studied the simulation of the hydrogen production by 
3 
 
and HTWGS-2, are added to increase the hydrogen 
yield and reduce the concentration of carbon monoxide. 
The kinetic model of HTWGS is expressed by (Keiski 
et al., 1996):

)  (10) 
As shown in Fig. 1(b), a pressure swing adsorption 
(PSA) units, a flash separator and three compressors 
are used for hydrogen purification and liquefaction. 
The hydrogen purification has two stages: a 
combination of a PSA-1 unit and an HTWGS-2 unit is 
used in the first stage and a combination of a flash 
separator and a PSA-2 unit is used in the second stage. 
High-purity hydrogen exits from the top of the PSA-2 
unit. The waste gases from the bottom of the PSA-2 
unit mixed with unreacted methane are fed in the 
combustor to produce flue gas at very high temperature. 
The hydrogen liquefaction is performed by three 
compressors. The outlet stream of the system is liquid 
hydrogen at 313K. Since some of the units are 
non-isothermal, many heating and cooling devices are 
added to adjust the temperature of each stream. 
According to the process configuration in Fig. 1, a 
steady-state simulation was conducted based on the 
following conditions: 
(1) All reactions in each unit occur in the gas phase. 
(2) The SMR unit, CO2 reformer, and HTWGS reactor 
are considered to be plug flow reactors. 
(3) The thermodynamic properties of some species are 
evaluated using the Peng-Robinson equation of 
state. 
 
Fig. 2 Mole fraction of methane at outlet of SMR vs. S/C 
for various temperatures 
 
Fig. 2 shows that the unreacted CH4 mole% at the 
outlet of the SMR unit decreases with increasing 
steam-to-methane molar ratio (S/C) and operating 
temperature of the feed flow. For the conventional 
SMR process [11], a methane flow of 59.68 kg/hr and 
a water flow of 209.52 kg/hr are fed at room 
temperature. Table 1 shows S/C=3.12, unreacted 
CH4=3.9%, and a corresponding heat supply of 234 
kW. The mole fraction profiles of every component in 
the SMR unit and CO2 reformer are shown in Fig. 3. 
Notably, methane and carbon monoxide are almost 
used up at the exit of HTWGS-2, with a hydrogen flow 
rate and purity of 29.53 kg/hr and 99.95% at the outlet 
of PSA-2, respectively. HTWGS-1 and HTWGS-2 
units are used to reduce CO concentration, but they 
produce large amount of CO2. To evaluate the benefits 
of the process design with respect to hydrogen 
production and carbon dioxide reduction, the ratio of 
the feed flow of methane to the outlet flow of hydrogen 
(CH4/H2) and the ratio of the emission of carbon 
dioxide to the product flow of hydrogen (CO2/H2) are 
given. The values are CH4/H2(kg/kg)=2.02 and CO2/H2 
(kg/kg)=5.45. Using the data given in reference [11] 
for the conventional SMR process, the values are 
CH4/H2(kg/kg)=2.84 and CO2/H2(kg/kg)= 6.78. Two 
ratios of CH4/H2 and CO2/H2 by proposed process are 
all lower than by the conventional SMR process. It is 
evidence that the proposed design can effectively 
increase the hydrogen yield but the carbon dioxide 
emissions can be suppressed.

6. Conclusion 
 This study examined the enhancement of 
hydrogen production and the reduction of carbon 
dioxide emission in a heat-integrated process. The 
main results shown in this article are summarized as 
follows: 
1. The catalytic carbon dioxide reforming process 
with specific kinetics is verified to reduce the 
amount of CO2. 
2. A CO2 reformer connected to the outlet stream of 
an SMR reactor can increase CO2 conversion by 
consuming CO2 and unreacted methane. 
3. According to indices of CH4/H2 and CO2/H2, 
methane and carbon dioxide are verified to 
increase the hydrogen yield. 
4. The optimal HEN meets the target of the 
maximum heat recovery. 
5. By Aspen Energy Analyzer with prescribed cost 
parameters, the annual total cost for the HEN 
superstructure is evaluated.
