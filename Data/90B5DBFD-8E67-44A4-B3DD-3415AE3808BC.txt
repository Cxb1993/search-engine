英文摘要：Transition metal oxynitrides have become emerging decorative coating materials due 
to their adjustable coloration and high hardness and corrosion resistance. This research studied 
the effect of oxygen content on the coloration, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of 
ZrNxOy thin films deposited on AISI 304 stainless steel using hollow cathode discharge ion 
plating (HCD-IP). The Zr/N/O ratios of the ZrNxOy films were determined using X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The color of the ZrNxOy thin film changed from golden 
yellow to blue and then slate blue with increasing oxygen content. X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
patterns revealed that phase separation of ZrN and m-ZrO2 occurred as the oxygen content 
reached 31.2 at.%. ZrN(O) (ZrN with dissolving oxygen) is dominant at oxygen content less than 
18.1 at.%, while m-ZrO2 phase was prevailed at oxygen content above 40.3 at.%. Phase 
separation lowered the hardness of the ZrNxOy films as the fraction of ZrO2 was less than 40%. 
The residual stresses in ZrN phase was higher than that in ZrO2, and the residual stress decreased 
for the specimen containing 30 to 37% ZrO2. For the samples containing more than 44% ZrO2, 
the average residual stress was close to that in ZrO2 phase. The corrosion resistance was 
evaluated by salt spray test and potentiodynamic scan in two solutions: 0.5MH2SO4+0.05 M 
KSCN and 5% NaCl solutions. The results showed consistent trend in the two solutions. From the 
results of potentiodynamic scan, corrosion resistance increased as the packing density of the film 
increased, whereas the film thickness was not a crucial factor on corrosion current; moreover, the 
electrical conductivity of the film may be one of the significant factors in corrosion resistance. 
Results of salt spray tests suggested that the corrosion of ZrNxOy in NaCl may play an important 
role in corrosion resistance.

Abstract 
Nanocrystalline ZrNxOy thin films were deposited on p-type Si (100) substrates using hollow 
cathode discharge ion-plating (HCD-IP) and the films were annealed at 700 and 900°C under 
controlling atmosphere.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the phase separation, 
phase transformation and the corresponding properties of the heat-treated ZrNxOy films 
deposited by ion plating.  With the increase of oxygen flow rate ranging from 0 to 10 sccm, 
the primary phase for the as-deposited films evolved from pure ZrN phase to nearly 
amorphous structure and further to a single m-ZrO2 phase.  After heat treatment at 700 and 
900°C, phase transformation occurred in the samples deposited at 8 and 10 sccm oxygen flow 
rates, where a stoichiometric crystalline Zr2ON2 was found to derive from the m-ZrO2 
structure containing N content (m-ZrO2(N)).  The hardness of the ZrNxOy thin films could 
be correlated to the oxide phase fraction. The film hardness decreased significantly as the 
fraction of ZrO2+Zr2ON2 exceeded ~ 60%, which was due to phase transition by increasing 
oxygen flow rate or phase transformation induced by heat treatment.  The phase separation 
of m-ZrO2 from ZrN(O) may relieve the residual stress of the ZrNxOy specimens deposited at 
5 and 8 sccm O2, while increase the stress as oxygen flow rate increased to 10 sccm.  On the 
other hand, the phase transformation from m-ZrO2(N) to Zr2ON2 by heat treatment at both 
700 and 900°C may effectively relieve the residual stress of the ZrNxOy films.

Thin films deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes usually contain 
large amount of lattice defects owing to ion impingement [18].  For TMeNxOy thin films, the 
defects may result from the misplacement of oxygen or nitrogen atoms [9].  Heat treatment 
is one of the popular approaches to annihilate the lattice defects and thereby improving the 
properties of TMeNxOy thin films, by which the film microstructure changes with 
temperature as well as different atmosphere [7-11].  Generally, heat treatment can increase 
the crystallinity and improve the mechanical properties of TMeNxOy films [9,12].  Cunha et 
al. [9] investigated the structural evolution in ZrNxOy films as a function of annealing 
temperatures. They found no obvious change in the composition and the coloration of the 
deposited films after heat treatments.  In addition, a tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) phase was 
observed after heat treatments at temperatures above 600 °C.  Carvalho et al. [12] reported 
that the ZrN (200) peak shifts to strain-free position after annealing at 700°C.  The film 
hardness and residual stress are affected by the annealing temperature.  However, since the 
oxygen contents and the applied substrate bias may also affect the properties, the 
dependences of these two properties of ZrNxOy with annealing temperature are complicated.  
They concluded that the relatively high hardness values are not due to high compressive 
stresses, but to structural rearrangement in the films [9,12].   
There have been few studies performed in investigating the annealed ZrNxOy films 
deposited by magnetron sputtering [9,12], while there is no study on the heat treatment of  
ion-plated ZrNxOy films.  It is known that the ion species in those two popular PVD 
processes are different; the ion species in magnetron sputtering is mostly Ar ions while that in 
ion-plating is metal ions.  Different ion species may lead to differences in structure and 
properties of the corresponding oxynitride films.  Consequently, the effect of heat treatment 
is expected to be different on the structure and properties of ion-plated ZrNxOy films.  As 
mentioned, the new phase appearing after phase separation of the ZrN film with dissolving 
 5
Pa) of Ar.  After the initiation of electron beam, the working gas consisting of Ar and N2 
(99.9995% in purity) gases at 10.4 sccm and 17.5 sccm, respectively, accompanying O2 at 
flow rates ranging from 0 to 10 sccm was introduced to deposit ZrN and ZrNxOy films.  The 
total gas pressure was ranged from 0.160 to 0.186 Pa (1.2 × 10-3 to 1.4 × 10-3 torr) and the 
pumping speed was kept at 3400 l/s during deposition.  The gun power was maintained at 6 
kW, and the Zr source (99.2% in purity) was evaporated by the electron beam from the 
hollow cathode tube.  A negative bias voltage of 60 V was applied onto the substrate.  The 
substrate temperature was maintained at 350 5± °C monitoring by a thermocouple directly in 
contact with a mica sheet attaching on the back side of the substrate.  The deposition time 
was 56 minutes for all specimens. 
After deposition, the heat treating process of the specimens was preformed in a 
Lindberg high temperature furnace equipped with a quartz tube and connected with a 
mechanical pumping system.  The uniform temperature area was calibrated to ensure the 
accuracy of the process.  In order to eliminate the oxidation of specimen during heat 
treatment, the quartz tube was pumped down to a vacuum of 1.33 Pa (1 × 10-2 torr) and then 
was purged by flowing Ar gas. The gas purging was repeated five times, and finally a high 
purity forming gas consisting of Ar (95 vol.%) and H2 (5 vol.%) was introduced to fill the 
sealed quartz tube to a pressure of 108 kPa. The specimen was sealed by placing a silicon 
wafer face-to-face on the coating surface during annealing, and zirconium tablets were served 
as the oxygen getter to further reduce the oxygen partial pressure. The oxygen partial pressure 
in the quartz tube was monitored by a zirconia oxygen sensor (15% CaO-doped ZrO2) located 
just above the specimens. The heat treatment was carried out for two hours at two 
temperatures, 700°C and 900°C, at a heating rate of 7 °C/min.  The oxygen partial pressures 
were maintained at about 1.01 × 10-20 Pa (1 × 10-25 atm) and 1.01 × 10-17 Pa (1 × 10-22 atm) 
for 700°C and 900°C, respectively.  Then, the furnace was cooled down at a speed of 
 7
from the results of θ/2θ scans by Scherrer equation [27].  To increase the diffraction 
volume and avoid the diffraction peak from Si substrate, glancing incidence X-ray diffraction 
(GIXRD) was utilized for phase identification. The incident angle of X-ray was 2° and 2θ 
ranged from 20° to 100°.  
The microstructures of the ZrNxOy films were observed using a field-emission gun 
scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) operated at 3.0 kV.  The sample was 
cross-sectionally fractured and attached on a sample holder with carbon glue.  The film 
thickness was also measured from the SEM images.   
The hardness of the deposited films was measured by a nanoindenter equipped with a 
Berkovich indenter head, which was attached on an AFM.  In general, the indentation depth 
was less than one-tenth of the film thickness to avoid the substrate effect. The applying loads 
ranging from 4 mN to 8 mN were employed and the indentation depth was controlled at 35±5 
nm.  A quartz standard sample was used to calibrate the instrument and the accuracy was 
within 10 %.  The reported value of hardness was the average of ten measurements. The 
precision of each value was within 10 %. 
XRD and laser curvature methods were employed to determine the residual stresses of 
the ZrNxOy thin films.  The residual stresses in the ZrN, ZrO2 and Zr2ON2 phases were 
respectively determined using modified sin2ψ XRD method [28].  The Young's moduli of the 
films, E, were obtained from nanoindentation.  The laser curvature method measured the 
difference in curvature of a sample with and without deposited film.  The residual stress of 
thin film was calculated using the Stoney equation [29]. 
 
3. Results 
 The designation for samples is defined as follows.  AD represents as deposited; H7 and 
H9 stand for heating treating the specimen for two hours at a temperature of 700°C and 
 9
compositions of the annealed films are almost identical to that of the as-deposited one, as 
shown in Fig. 2.  Since the surface oxidation layer is less than 11 % of the film thickness, 
the compositions of the annealed (H7, H9) series specimens are taken as the same as those of 
the as-deposited (AD) series in this study.  
Fig. 3 depicts the XRD patterns for all specimens. As shown in the figure 3(a), the ZrN 
(111) peak is prevailed for the as-deposited films AD-0, AD-3 and AD-5.  The m-ZrO2 (111) 
peak can be deconvoluted from the left shoulder of the ZrN (111) peak of specimens AD-3 
and AD-5, which is in agreement with our previous study [1].  The XRD patterns indicate 
that the heat treated samples ranging from H7-0 to H7-5 and H9-0 to H9-3 are also dominated 
by the same ZrN (111) peak with a slight shift of the peak position to a higher 2θ angle. The 
Zr2ON2 (222) peak, corresponding to the bixbyite structure [31], is also found from the 
deconvoluted patterns of all annealed samples deposited at 0 to 5 sccm O2. Furthermore, a 
distinct Zr2ON2 (440) peak is observed in the sample H9-5, as shown in Fig. 3(a). 
The XRD patterns for the specimen deposited at 8 sccm O2 are shown in Fig. 3(b).  
The as-deposited film (sample AD-8) exhibits as a nearly amorphous structure. After 
annealing, the film structure evolves progressively from nearly amorphous phase (sample 
AD-8) to a distinct Zr2ON2 structure in samples H7-8 and H9-8. As the oxygen flow rate 
further increases to 10 sccm, the film structure changes from nearly amorphous phase 
(sample AD-8) to monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) phase (sample AD-10), as shown in Fig. 3 (c). 
Since only one m-ZrO2 (020) peak is observed in the sample AD-10, the m-ZrO2 structure 
should be further confirmed by GIXRD.  After heat treatment, the ZrNxOy film experiences 
a phase transformation from m-ZrO2 (AD-10) to Zr2ON2 (H7-10 and H9-10) phase.

+ + ) with respect to oxygen 
content is shown in Fig. 4.  In general, the fraction of oxide and oxynitride phases increases 
with the oxygen content for all specimens. There is no significant difference in oxide and 
 11
AD-3, as shown in Fig. 6 (b).  For the sample AD-5, the microstructure becomes a distinct 
fine grain structure with the grain size less than 10nm (Fig. 6 (c)). The SEM image of 
specimen AD-8 reveals a columnar structure with a thicker column width about 50 nm, as 
shown in Fig. 6 (d). Finally, a flat and featureless structure is found in Fig. 6 (e) for the 
specimen AD-10 deposited at 10 sccm O2. 
The microstructure does not significantly change for the specimens deposited at 0 and 
3 sccm O2, while it changes obviously for the samples deposited at 5, 8 and 10 sccm O2. In 
Fig. 7 (a), the sample H9-5 shows a mixing structure consisting of the fine grain structure and 
some gravel-like grains. The image of sample H9-8 (Fig. 7(b)) reveals larger slanting 
columns interspersed with fine columnar grains. After heat treatment, the flat and featureless 
structure of sample AD-10 is changed to rocky-grain structure in sample H9-10, as shown in 
Fig. 7(c).  From XRD results, phase transformations occur in the samples deposited at 5, 8 
and 10 sccm O2 before and after heat treatments, suggesting that the variation of the 
microstructure may be related to the phase transformation. 
Fig. 8 shows the variation of hardness with the oxygen content of the ZrNxOy thin films. 
The hardness for the as-deposited films (AD series) is ranged from 28.3 to 17.2 GPa. It can 
be seen that the hardness initially increases from 27.1 to 28.3 GPa with the increase of the 
oxygen content from 11.5 % to 13.2 %. This is consistent with our previous study [1], where 
the increase of hardness is attributed to solution hardening of excess oxygen atoms or 
precipitation hardening of oxide. Then the hardness continuously decreases from 28.3 to 17.2 
GPa as the oxygen content increases from 13.2 % to 27.7 %. Finally, the hardness slightly 
increases from 17.2 to 19.3 GPa when the oxygen content increases from 27.7 % to 32.2 %.  
After the annealing at 700°C, no obvious influence on the film hardness is found, except 
for the sample H7-3, where the hardness significantly decreases from 28.3 GPa to 22.5 GPa. 
After annealing at 900°C, the decrease of hardness is substantial for the specimens containing 
 13
and the specimens were annealed at 700 and 900°C in a controlled atmosphere with oxygen 
partial pressures about 10-25 atm and 10-22 atm, respectively. Although the oxygen partial 
pressure was controlled to an extremely low level, surface oxidation about 70 nm in depth 
still occurred on samples deposited at 0-3 sccm O2, where ZrN was the major crystalline 
phase in the ZrNxOy thin films. The thermodynamic requirements of the oxygen partial 
pressures for avoiding oxidation in ZrN are 1.73 × 10-36 atm and 8.06 × 10-30 atm at 700°C 
and 900°C, respectively.  It is obvious that the controlled atmosphere was orders of 
magnitude away from the theoretical level.  Consequently, it is not surprised that there 
would be minor oxidation on the sample surface.  Nevertheless, the compositions of the 
ZrNxOy films under the thin oxide layer remain almost the same after the heat treatments. 
Therefore, the heat treatment process was considered to be under a proper environment and 
excessive oxidation did not occur during the process.  
In this study, the primary phase for all as-deposited samples evolves from ZrN (111) 
phase to nearly amorphous structure and further to a single m-ZrO2 structure, but no 
significant Zr2ON2 peak is observed as the oxygen flow rate increases from 0 to 10 sccm, as 
shown in Figs. 3 and 5. Therefore, only two phases, ZrN and m-ZrO2 phases, are obtained 
during deposition, which is in agreement with our previous study [1].  
The predominated structure with respect to the variation of oxygen flow rates can be 
determined by the competition between kinetic and thermodynamic factors. The nitrogen 
flow rate in this study was maintained at 17.5 sccm, which is higher than the oxygen flow 
rate ranging from 0 to 10 sccm, and hence the ion impingement flux of N2 is higher than that 
of O2 on the deposited films.  As a result, the formation of ZrN phase is kinetically favored 
than that of m-ZrO2 structure.  On the other hand, m-ZrO2 phase is thermodynamically 
stabler than the ZrN phase [9]. 
Table 2 lists the bonding fractions of Zr-N, Zr-(NO) and Zr-O determined from XPS for 
 15
structure being able to contain more oxygen atoms and lower the free energy. 
The sample AD-10 is mainly composed of m-ZrO2 with 9 % Zr-O bonding and 82.3 % 
Zr-(NO) mix bonding, which indicates that both thermodynamic and kinetic factors favor the 
formation of oxide at this deposition condition. The excess O atoms increase the fraction of 
Zr-(NO) mix bonding and facilitate the formation of m-ZrO2(N) structure. It is noted that the 
(O+N)/Zr ratio of AD-10 sample is 1.8, less than 2, implying that a certain amount of N on O 
sites and vacancies may exist in the m-ZrO2 lattice. 
After heat treatment, the samples deposited at O flow rate lower than 5 sccm still 
possess ZrN structure, as shown in Fig. 3(a). However, a new Zr2ON2 (440) peak [31] is 
observed in the sample H9-5. In addition, phase transformation occurs in the specimens 
deposited at 8 and 10 sccm O2. Specimen AD-8 transforms from a nearly amorphous 
structure to Zr2ON2 + m-ZrO2 phase (H7-8) and further to Zr2ON2 phase (H9-8) after 
annealing. In sample AD-10, the crystal structure transforms from m-ZrO2 to Zr2ON2 phase 
after annealing at both 700 and 900°C. 
The phase transformation in the specimen deposited at 10 sccm O2 indicates that 
Zr2ON2 phase is derived from the m-ZrO2(N) after annealing. As depicted in Fig. 11, the 
atom arrangement in a unit cell of m-ZrO2 is similar to that of a 1/8 unit cell of Zr2ON2. The 
minor differences between the two crystals are small deviations in lattice parameters and the 
two vacant sites containing in Zr2ON2 lattice. Since the m-ZrO2 structure in sample AD-10 
contains a certain amount of N atoms and vacancies, the thermal energy provided by heat 
treatment may enhance the diffusion of atoms and facilitate the rearrangement of atoms, 
which may lead to the annihilation of point defects and the transformation of m-ZrO2 to 
Zr2ON2. The result also suggests that Zr2ON2 phase is apparently stabler than m-ZrO2 phase 
for the film containing about 30% N. 
 The phase transformation from nearly amorphous structure consisting of ZrN and 
 17
transformation by heat treatment. Compared the hardness results in Fig. 8 with the oxide 
phases ratio in Fig. 4, it is noted that when the oxide phases fraction is more than about 60%, 
the film hardness significantly lowers down to a relatively small value, ranging from 16.9 to 
19.3 GPa. In other words, as the oxide phases become dominant in the ZrNxOy films, with or 
without heat treatment, the film hardness decreases significantly. Therefore, the film hardness 
is strongly affected by the phase transition from ZrN dominant structure to m-ZrO2 and/or 
Zr2ON2 phases. The hardness results also indicate that the oxide phases are softer than ZrN 
dominant structure. This also explains the abrupt decrease in hardness in sample H9-5, where 
the oxide phases ratio increases from 28.2% in sample H7-5 to 58.9%.   
The decrease in hardness in sample H7-3 compared with sample AD-3 may be from 
more complicated reasons. The thermal energy might facilitate atom rearrangement and 
eliminate the O atoms dissolved in the ZrN phase, which reduces the effect of solution 
hardening. It is speculated that the excess oxygen for solution hardening may be consumed 
due to the precipitation of oxide phases after heat treatment, thereby lowering the film 
hardness. 
In our previous studies [1], the residual stress of the ZrNxOy thin films deceases with 
the increase of oxygen content or m-ZrO2 phase ratio.  The residual stress in the m-ZrO2 
phase is lower than that in ZrN phase, which is attributed to lower ion impingement due to 
the lower electrical conductivity of m-ZrO2. As the oxide phase ratio is less than 30%, the 
residual stress of the thin film is mainly from that in ZrN phase. When the oxide phase ratio 
reaches 30% and above, the residual stress is mostly derived from the stress in m-ZrO2 phase. 
Therefore, the average residual stresses of the thin films determined by optical method with 
respect to the oxygen content may exhibit a consistent trend with the residual stresses in the 
primary phase measured by XRD. 
From Fig. 8, it can been seen that except for the sample AD-0 where ZrN phase is 
 19
sites and a looser packing. In addition, heat treatments can induce the formation of Zr2ON2 
phase which may relieve the stress. Compared with AD-series specimens, all specimens show 
distinct stress relief after heat treatment at 900°C, which may be associated with more 
complete phase separation or phase transformation of oxide phases and consequently 
decreasing the defects in the thin films.   
 
5. Conclusions 
1. ZrNxOy thin films, consisting of ZrN and m-ZO2 phases, were deposited on P-type (100) Si 
wafers using hollow cathode discharge ion-plating (HCD-IP).  With the continuous 
increase of the oxygen flow rate ranging from 0 to 10 sccm, the as-deposited ZrNxOy films 
show a phase transition from a primary ZrN phase to a nearly amorphous phase, and finally 
to primary m-ZrO2 phase.  
2. Heat treatments induces a phase transformation of m-ZrO2(N) to Zr2ON2, which is more 
distinct for the samples deposited at 8 and 10 sccm oxygen flow rates. 
3. The hardness of the ZrNxOy thin films can be correlated to the oxide phase fraction. The 
film hardness decreases significantly as the fraction of ZrO2+Zr2ON2 exceeds ~ 60%, 
which is from phase transition by increasing oxygen flow rate or phase transformation 
induced by heat treatment. 
4. The phase separation of m-ZrO2 from ZrN(O) may relieve the residual stress of the ZrNxOy 
specimens deposited at 5 and 8 sccm O2, while increase the stress as oxygen flow rate 
increased to 10 sccm.  On the other hand, the phase transformation from m-ZrO2(N) to 
Zr2ON2 by heat treatment at both 700 and 900°C may effectively relieve the residual stress 
of the ZrNxOy films.

計畫編號 NSC 96-2221-E-007-094 
計畫名稱 奈米晶氮氧化鋯薄膜之製備及其結構與性質研究 
出國人員姓名 
服務機關及職稱 
國立清華大學工程與系統科學系 黃嘉宏教授 
 
會議時間地點 四月二十八日至五月二日，美國加州聖地牙哥市 
會議名稱 2008國際冶金鍍膜與薄膜國際會議 
發表論文題目 Heat Treatment Induced Phase Separation and Phase Transformation of Zr(N,O) Thin Films by Ion Plating 
 
一、參加會議經過 
本年度之國際冶金鍍膜與薄膜國際會議於四月二十八日至五月二日在美國加州聖地牙哥市之
Town and Country Hotel 的會議中心舉行。本人與本系同事喻冀平教授於四月二十六日由台灣
搭長榮航空班機於同日先到洛杉磯停留一夜後，於四月二十七日租車前往聖地牙哥會議地
點，並於四月三十日下午二時三十分口頭發表論文。在四天主要的議程中，分七至八個專題
區同時舉行。每天議程提早由早上八時開始，中午休息時間多半小時，至下午五時結束。由
於議程平行進行，本人只能選擇與研究方向相近之議程參與，其他議程僅能選擇性的參與。
週四(五月一日)晚上五時至七時為海報論文發表時間，會議於五月二日閉幕後，先租車返回
洛杉磯停留一夜後，本人與喻教授於五月三日下午至洛杉磯搭乘長榮航空班機於四日晚間返
抵國門。 
 
二、與會心得 
本人曾於過去七年連續參加 ICMCTF 會議，加上 2000 年之前參加過兩次，此次是本人
第十次參加。今年各國與會人數較去年略少，約有八百人的規模，值得一提的是台灣代表團
約有六十餘人，被會議接受發表之口頭與壁報文章將近百篇，以人數與論文數而言，是除了
美國之外參與人數第二的國家。今年歐洲國家參加的人數仍維持相當多約佔所有與會人數的
百分之四十，與會主力為歐洲幾個傳統工業國家如：德國、瑞士、瑞典、法國、英國、西班
牙、義大利、奧地利與葡萄牙，美國仍為參加人數最多的國家約佔百分之三十。在亞洲國家
方面除了台灣人數最多之外，韓國亦為參加人數較多的國家，日本參加人數不多，與台灣和
韓國不同之處在於，日本與會者大多來自工業界。中國大陸方面今年有人由大陸直接來美與
會，不過人數仍然很少，但若計入大陸在美、加地區旅外學人，則人數亦有二十至三十人。
今年內容一如以往具有學術與應用兩個面向，尤其是大會演講者與各議程中之邀請演講者均
有非常高的水準，因此參與此會收獲相當豐碩，在此謹將心得報告如下。 
得到大筆經費補助而無實質產品。個人的看法是，有效之理論計算可以縮短嘗試錯誤的時間，
因此計算材料科學應可扮演相當重要腳色，國內必須要開始籌組兼具實驗與計算的團隊，結
合計算方面相關的人力，方可縮短與先進國家之差距。 
此外在奈米管、奈米線、奈米顆粒與奈米薄膜方面的邀請演講者中，美國賓州大學 C.B. 
Murray教授利用化學合成方法製作多元奈米晶功能薄膜的演講令人印象深刻。在他們的研究
中，可以設計並合成出具有寬能隙、狹能隙、磁性、光性、量子點的各式薄膜。 
在薄膜分析技術方面，今年主要在殘餘應力分析與薄膜材料彈性常數測量有相當大的進
展。殘餘應力分析除了是今年大會演講主題外，荷蘭與奧地利的團隊均有相當優異的研究成
果，荷蘭方面的研究主要在於利用減薄薄膜厚度量測與計算薄膜應力梯度。而奧地利方面更
利用同步輻射 X光源，進行薄膜應力與應變高溫下量測，進而計算其彈性常數。美國MetaGlass
公司研究員 Paggett博士更利用本人與程海東教授在 2002年所提出之低掠角 X光 cos2αsin2ψ
方法，量測金屬玻璃薄膜應變。本人在壁報論文中亦提出結合光學曲率與 X 光 sin2ψ 方法量
測薄膜彈性常數之研究成果。 
在奈米多層結構薄膜方面，西北大學 S.A.Barnett教授做了一個相當完整的回顧。Barnett
教授為此方面研究之佼佼者，他提出了相當多的奈米多層膜結構，其中最重要的原理在於，
所選取之各層材料必須要在相圖上有不互溶區，如此形成多層膜之後，才能在高溫下各層不
互相反應，維持原來所設計的性質，此類系統目前已可耐溫至 1000°C 並仍有 50GPa 的超高
硬度。但此類薄膜在製程上必需有嚴密的厚度控制，否則無法達到設計的機械性質。 
如前所述，本次會議由於台灣的與會人數有六十多人，成員主要來自國內公私立大學教
授與研究生，業界參與人數仍居少數。由於每年參與人數眾多，台灣的學者已有進入籌備委
員會，並有人擔任 session chairman。在提高國際能見度方面，本人認為應繼續鼓勵國內產學
界參與此會，以保有的來不易之地位。此外，雖有如此眾多的參與人數，但口頭發表論文的
人數仍不夠多，台灣的學者應在會中扮演更重要的角色，希望與會者能爭取發表口頭報告論
文的機會，以提高台灣的能見度。 
此次會議中論文所顯示的幾個鍍膜重要發展方向如下： 
(1) 鍍膜與薄膜製程如今已成為跨領域研究之重要主題之一，與會者所屬單位實在非常多樣，
有傳統的冶金與材料科學、物理、化學、化工、機械、電機等領域；亦有生物與醫學方面
的人加入生醫薄膜材料的研究。其中理論與實驗的結合趨勢，最令人印象深刻，不論在鍍
膜製程、機械性質、薄膜成長與材料科學，均有很專門的物理與化學學者參與，團隊合作
已是常態。 
(2) 多元複雜成分薄膜之研究成為主流研究課題之一，其研究除了在學理探討之外，應用研究
