Abstract 
  Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are 
potential candidates for the application on 
disposable sensors due to low simple fabrication 
processing costs. A new simple process UV 
treatment is introduced to enhance ammonia 
(NH3) gas sensing at room temperature. By using 
UV treatment on PMMA dielectric surface, the 
functional end group on the dielectric surface 
was modulated form methyl (-CH3) to carboxyl 
(-COOH). The new functional end group creates 
excess negatively charged sites and enhances the 
dipole moment of dielectric surface. Furthermore, 
this method upgrades the NH3 gas or 
positive-charged ammonium molecules (NH4+) 
to aggregate close to the surface between 
pentacene and dielectric. Therefore, a proposed 
method enhances NH3 gas sensing capabilities. 
Mobility is an important parameter because of 
the fast response, the variation almost kept at the 
value at a fixed concentration of NH3 gas. Most 
important of all, the sensing selectivity of the 
sensor is demonstrated in this study.  Finally, 
we demonstrated a possible sensing mechanism 
by increasing the relative humidity (RH) of 
chamber.  
Keywords : Organic thin film transistors

二、 計畫緣由與目的 
 
  Analyzing the chemical composition of human 
breath can help people to observe their condition 
of body. Lavoisier used a solution of Ca(OH)2 to 
detect CO2 in human breath in the percent range. 
Since the 1960s, a breath-testing for alcohol has 
been used to detect ethanol concentrations in the 
ppm range and it has been applied extensively in 
alcohol tests on drivers so far. Besides the 
considerable nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and 
carbon dioxide from the breath of general people, 
it still has more than 400 different volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) [1] in human breath 
in the parts per billion (ppb) range. Therefore, 
 1
of breath, tightening of the chest , pulmonary 
edema (lung water) for at least 24 hour period. 
Exposure to 5000~10000ppm can cause death 
within 5~10 minutes. Therefore, it is both useful 
and necessary that a portable and disposable the 
NH3 sensor be developed. Recently, NH3 sensors 
have found application areas, such as for 
automotive industry, chemical industry, and 
most significantly, for medical diagnostic. For 
example, in the automotive industry, NH3 
sensors are used for NOx sensing. In the 
chemical industry, the NH3 sensors could be 
used to monitor the quality of fertilizers and 
frozen foods. Additionally, in the area of medical 
diagnostics, patients with diseases such as renal 
failure and cirrhosis will breath higher 
concentration of NH3 than healthy people, which 
as shown in Table 1(b). Also, the sensitivity of 
the sensor is required for detecting the patient’s 
breath concentrations. By using UV treatment on 
PMMA dielectric surface, which will enhance 
the sensitivity of OTFTs to NH3 gas and it will 
be discussed later. Currently, NH3 sensors such 
as metal oxide sensors, catalytic sensors, and 
optical analyzers have disadvantages such as 
high temperature requirements or high cost [21]. 
Fortunately, in our previous study, we have 
found that the pentacene-based OTFTs can be a 
sensitive NH3 sensor at room temperature. The 
sensitivity can be lower than 0.5 ppm, which is 
the lowest sensitivity to NH3 in the OTFTs gas 
sensors so far. In this paper, we modify the 
dielectric interface by UV treatment to create a 
local field of the dielectric interface and to 
enhance the sensitivity of our device. In many 
cases of ammonia sensors are fabricated as 
resistors, such as metal oxide sensor and the thin 
film of polyaniline [22] NH3 gas sensor. To date, 
these sensors can analyze the resistance variation 
or the conductance variation. The resistor 
sensors are limited the detection capabilities and 
some of them require high temperatures to 
enhance the sensitivity. However, we used 
multi-parameters that included current variation, 
threshold voltage shift, mobility variation, and 
subthreshold swing to obtain more information 
from changes on exposure to an analyte. 
Measurements of these parameters may allow for 
recognition of molecular species. In this paper, a 
new proposed method to enhance the smell 
sensing sensitivity was proposed. The 
PMMA-OTFTs sensitivity to ammonia 
effectively alters the functional end group on the 
dielectric surface by UV irradiation. 
 
三、 研究方法及成果 
3.1 Substrate preparation 
 
  OTFTs have been fabricated on a Si substrate. 
Highly doped p-type silicon wafers with 100 nm 
thick SiO2 were used as the starting substrate, in 
which the SiO2 film and p-type Si acted as the 
gate insulator and gate electrode, respectively. 
We used the PMMA [poly(methyl methacrylate)] 
as the buffer layer to modify SiO2 dielectric 
surface. PMMA we used was obtained from 
MicroChem Corp (with a molecular weight of 
95000), which was dissolved in anisole at 10 wt 
%. Before we spun the PMMA as the surface 
treatment, DI water and acetone were used 5 
minutes each to clean the SiO2 gate-insulator. 
Then, the PMMA was spun onto the gate 
insulator at a speed of approximately 8000 rpm 
for 40 seconds. After spin-on coating, the 
PMMA was transferred to a hot-plate and 
annealed at 90℃ for 30 minutes. The thickness 
of PMMA was estimated by capacitance 
measurement Agilent HP4284. The capacity of 
PMMA/SiO2 dielectric was about 23-24 nF/cm2. 
Some of the samples were then exposed to 
UV-light (wavelength = 175-285 nm and output 
power = 40 mW) for 60 seconds. The dielectric 
of UV-treated sample is shown in Fig. 6(a). 
 
3.2 Pentacene film deposition through shadow 
mask  
 
  The pentacene material obtained from Aldrich 
without any purification was directly used for 
the deposition. It is well known that the three 
critical parameters to the quality of the organic 
film are the deposition pressure, deposition rate, 
and deposition temperature [23]. Deposition of 
pentacene film was started at a pressure near 
1×10-6 torr and the deposition-rate was 
controlled at ~0.5Å/sec, and monitored by the 
 3
channel width, channel length, and dielectric 
capacitance. Generally, mobility can be 
extracted from the transconductance maximum 
gm in the linear region form Eq. (4). [16]:

The device exhibit a mobility around 0.3 cm2/Vs. 
Also, the subthreshold swing (S.S.) of the 
devices was around 0.66 V/decade. Subthreshold 
swing can be calculated using Eq. (5). 
Subthreshold swing describes the distribution of 
interface trap density, which can estimate the 
interface trap density may be estimated by [26].

where S is the subtheshold swing; e is the 
Napierian logarithm; k is the Boltzmann’s 
constant; and T is the absolute temperature.  
The selectivity of a gas sensor is very 
important. Furthermore, we compare the device 
sensing behavior to different kinds of gas such as 
carbon dioxide (CO2), alcohol (C2H5OH), 
methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3) and acetone 
(CH3COCH3). Each of them was measured in N2 
ambiance and the concentration of the others gas 
is more than 1ppm. The threshold voltage shift 
and mobility variation were plotted as a function 
of time with an error bar in Fig 3(a) and Fig 3(b), 
respectively. As a result, the devices only have 
response to NH3 gas. The threshold voltage shift 
had a larger sensitivity after 1000 seconds. 
However, the mobility variation was more stable 
than threshold voltage shift and has a faster 
response. A possible reason for the large 
response may be the different solubility and acid 
dissociation constant, Ka, (also known as acidity 
constant, or acid-ionization constant). The 
devices were exposed to air because we do not 
have any passivation on them. Therefore, the 
pentacene film was covered with moisture. 
Analyte introduced into the chamber, may have 
dissolved into moisture on the pentacene. 
Carbon dioxide and methane are not easily to 
solution in the water than other gases. Although 
alcohol, ammonia and acetone can be held in 
solution in water. But we know that only acid 
and alkali will dissociate in water, therefore, we 
will discuss only the NH3 molecules.  
−+ +↔+ OHNHOHNH 3       (6)        42
  Under the moisture ambiance, ammonia 
molecules easily dissolve in water and form 
ammonium (NH4+), which is shown in Eq. (6). 
Although our gas sensing system is in low 
oxygen and moisture, it still has sufficient 
amounts of moisture to create ammonium (NH4+), 
and enable the reaction of Eq. (6). Therefore, 
NH4+ molecules might be created and adsorbed 
on the pentacene bulk or even diffuse into a 
transport channel through grain boundaries by 
the negative gate bias. The influence of moisture 
will be discuessed later. From the table 1(b), 
patients such as renal failure and cirrhosis will 
breath high concentration ammonia gas around 
4.8ppm and above 0.5ppm, respectively. 
Therefore, our devices detected several different 
concentration of ammonia gas to testing the 
sensitivity. We used the multi-parameters to 
analyze the changes during exposed to NH3 gas. 
Subthreshold swing was almost unchanged and 
the current varitation was affected by threshold 
voltage shift and mobilty variation. Threshold 
voltage shift and mobility variation of standard 
PMMA-OTFTs with error bar to different 
concentration of ammonia gas were shown in Fig 
4(a) and Fig 4(b), respectively. Ammonia 
sensors, which could detect low concentration of 
ammonia gas, can be develpoed the non-invasive 
diagnostic devices. Both two parameters have 
larger response above 3ppm ammonia gas. In 
lower concentration, it is hard to distinguish 
between 0.5 and 1ppm. In order to solve the 
issue, we proposed a method to modify and 
enhance the dipole moment of dielectric surface 
by UV-light irradiation. The dielectric surface 
was irradiated by UV-light for 60 seconds, 
which as shown in Fig 5(a). The UV-treatment 
modified the PMMA functional end-groups from 
methyl (-CH3) to carboxyl (-COOH), which

五、 結論 
  In summary, by using UV treatment, we 
demonstrated the potential for application of 
pentacene-based PMMA-OTFTs as NH3 gas 
sensors and operable room temperature. The 
interaction of pentacene film with NH3 gas was 
investigated by analyzing transistors transfer 
characteristics. In the NH3 gas ambiance, both 
the threshold voltage and the mobility had a 
larger response due to the NH4+ molecules were 
created in the organic thin film, especially in the 
high relative humidity environment. However, 
subthreshold swing remained almost unchanged, 
which mean that NH3 gas did not vary the 
distribution of dielectric interface trap density. 
As a result, NH4+ molecules were adsorbed onto 
the interface between pentacene and dielectric by 
the gate bias, which caused a negative shift 
threshold voltage and a decreased in mobility. 
This trend was more observed in UV-treated 
PMMA-OTFTs because of a local electric field, 
that occured due to the PMMA functional 
end-group -COOH. Furthermore, sensitivity for 
NH3 gas was significantly enhanced. Mobility is 
the most significant parameter in our study 
because of its fast response, made it easy to 
detect the concentration of NH3 gas. From the 
result of adding water vapor, NH4+ molecules 
might the main reason to enhance NH3 sensing 
capability and it also demonstrated our supposed. 
The UV-treated PMMA-OTFTs should have a 
great potential as a ammonia biosensing device 
for future application in biomedical diagnosis.

In this paper, the influence of light induced electrons on the 
threshold voltage shift of organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) was 
studied. The light induced electrons are formed and accumulated in 
the channel near the interface of gate dielectric. The light source 
can be used as second source. Therefore, the study demonstrates 
the light induced electrons in channel can be affected by drain bias 
like bias stress. The decreasing accumulated electrons with 
increasing positive drain bias lower the threshold voltage shift rate 
during illumination time. The opposite trend can be observed when 
using negative drain increases accumulated electrons. This result is 
helpful to adjust the photosensivity of organic photo transistors.  
 
Introduction  
 
In many reports, the organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) were successfully 
fabricated on flexible substrate for displays and phototransistors. In organic materials, 
pentacene based TFTs have superior transfer characteristics, high field-effect mobility, 
high photosensitivity and high IPh/IDark ratio. When the pentacene based TFTs are used as 
switches in display application, these devices are difficult to avoid the environmental or 
internal illumination (organic light-emitting diodes or backlight). Therefore, illumination 
effect of pentacene based TFTs are worthy to study. In previous studies, the threshold 
voltage shift and hysteresis were usually observed under illumination. These influences 
can be attributed to electron trapping in the interface between gate dielectric and active 
layer [1, 2, 3]. Using the different interfacial trap densities of devices obtained from 
different gate dielectric treatments, electron trapping in the interface was demonstrated. 
The similar result also can be observed in wavelength effect of light source [4]. The light 
penetrated pentacene film and generated the charge carriers in the interface of gate 
dielectric.  
 
Based on above mention, threshold voltage shift of OTFTs is dominated by light-
induced electrons. Using light-induced electron concentration controlled by illumination, 
threshold voltage of OTFTs can be adjusted like a second gate. The light-induced 
threshold voltage shift also can be affected by additional bias was observed in some 
group [2, 3, 5]. The opposite direction of threshold voltage shifts were observed under 
positive and negative gate bias stress during illumination. It shows that light-induced 
carriers and gate-bias-induced accumulated carriers compensate each other. In other word, 
light-induced threshold voltage shift value can be represented as photosensitivity ability 
of OTFTs. Dependent on more or less channel carrier concentration, the photosensitivity 
of OTFTs is determined. In our previous study [6], the channel carrier concentration is 
simultaneously affected by gate and drain bias. It is expected that the light induced 
threshold voltage has drain bias dependence and the additional method to control the 
photosensitivity of OTFTs is obtained in this experiment.  
positive drain bias (VD = Vapp) during illumination. It is observed that, during illumination, 
the negative source bias has almost no influence on ΔVth when a positive drain bias is 
applied. The result implies that the positive drain bias effect is more dominant than the 
negative drain bias effect. 
 
Conclusion 
 
From the above results, it is observed that the threshold voltage shift have strong 
dependence on the concentration of light induced electrons. Using drain bias can 
effectively adjust the accumulated electrons in channel. We can observe that the electron 
carriers followed a lateral electrical field. When the field helps electrons flow out from 
pentacene film, the photosensitivity is suppressed. When the field blocks the electrons, 
photosensitivity is enhanced. This experiment provides a method to adjust the 
photosensivity of OTFTs dependent on specific condition.
