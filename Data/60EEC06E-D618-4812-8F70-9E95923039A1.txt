dimer. The process of fluorescence is simply divided 
into two stages, the excitation and the emission. For 
the excitation stage, a model of an incident plane wave 
illuminating a nanoshell dimer to excite the molecule, 
which is placed within the gap of the nanoshell dimer, 
is simulated. For the emission stage, another model of 
an electric dipole interacting with the dimer is used to 
simulate the emission of the excited molecule under 
the influence of the nearby nanoshell dimer. We found 
that a stronger local electric field is induced within the 
gap of the gold nanoshell dimer for exciting the 
molecule, compared to a gold nanodimer. In addition, 
the quantum yield of the nanoshell dimer is higher 
than that of a single gold nanoshell, so it is an efficient 
nanoantenna for the emission of the dipole. Summarily, 
a gold nanoshell dimer can provide a higher 
enhancement of the fluorescence of a single molecule 
than a single gold nanoparticle or gold dimer.  
For the experiment, core-shelled nanoparticles were 
synthesized by coating a silica-layer on Au or Ag 
nanoparticles, where the silica is doped with 
dye-molecules. Using this technique, the distance 
between the dye-molecules with the metal can be 
controlled within a small distance for the further study 
of the interaction of fluorescence with SPR. The 
measurement of the enhancement factor of these 
coreshelled nanoparticles on the fluorescence is being 
conducted now by using fluorescence 
spectrophotometer.  
Moreover, we incubated the human macrophages 
with Au nanoparticles, and used laser-scanning 
confocal microscopy with CW laser (514 nm) to study 
the real-time endocytosis and exocytosis processes of 
macrophages for Au nanoparticles. In addition, the 
blebbing phenomenon of cells was induced by irradiating 
these macrophages by an ultrafast Ti: Sapphire IR-laser 
(800 nm). So far, the mechanism of the cell’s blebbing is 
being studied now.

1. Introduction 
 
  Recently, the fluorescent emission of a single 
molecule in the presence of a metallic nanostructure 
has been extensively studied to understand how the 
nanostructure can enhance or quench the 
fluorescence. In particular, a metallic dimer, 
nanoantenna, nanospheroid, nanoshell, and nanoshell 
dimer were proposed, due to the strong local electric 
fields in their gaps induced by the surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR). However some of the previous 
experiments of metallic colloid exhibited a quenching, 
rather than an enhancement, on the fluorescence, and 
only few experiments exhibited an enhancement. The 
cause is very complicated, not only depending on 
Forster’s energy transfer by SPR but also depending 
on the molecule’s absorption and emission spectra. 
The recent researches indicated that the phenomena 
of quenching could be mainly attributed to the poor 
quantum yield of the metallic nanostructure on the 
fluorescence at the SPR band. The distance of the 
molecule and the metallic nanoparticle is a key factor. 
To compromise the local-field factor and quantum 
yield, an optimal distance should be considered. The 
purpose of this research is to study the overall effect 
of a gold nanoshell dimer of 3D model on a single 
molecular fluorescence. All our works of the last year 
were or will be published in the list as follows. 
 
2. Theory of Simulation 
 
The two-stage model of the fluorescence is used for 
analysis; the excitation stage of the molecule and the 
following emission stage. The configuration of a gold 
nanoshell dimer and a molecule is shown in Fig. 1, 
where the molecule is assumed at the center of the gap 
of nanoshell dimer. Using the multiple multi-pole 
(MMP) method and boundary element method (BEM), 
the optical response of the system in each stage is 
analyzed.

single molecule placed within the gap of the dimer. 
The system is irradiation by an incident light to 
excite the molecule.  
3. Numerical Results & Discussion 
 
Since the strongest electric field occurs within the 
gap of the nanoshell dimer, we only discuss the case of 
a molecule located at the center of dimer. Our 
previous data of 2D and 3D model of solid Au dimer 
indicated that an incident plane wave with a 
polarization parallel to the axis (the line connecting 
two centers) of the dimer can induce the maximum 
local-field amplification and the quantum yield of a 
dipole with an orientation parallel to this axis is the 
maximum. Therefore in the following discussions, we 
only consider these conditions. The enhancement

Sapphire IR-laser (800 nm), as shown in Fig. 5. So far, the 
mechanism of the cell’s blebbing is being studied now. In 
addition, the synthesis of coreshelled nanoparticles is being 
conducted now, as shown in Fig. 6.

NPs irradiated by two-photon laser 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
We used MMP method to study the excitation rate, 
quantum yield and fluorescence enhancement factor 
of nanoshell dimer on a single molecule within the 
gap. We also developed a technique to monitor the 
real-time endocytosis and exocytosis of cells for 
gold nanoparticles by using laser scanning confocal 
microscopy. In addition, a method of synthesizing 
coreshells doped with dye is being conducted now.

Plasmonic Effect of Nanoshell Dimer for

Plasmonic Effect of Nanoshell Dimer for 
Molecular Fluorescence 
Abstract 
The enhancement of a single molecule’s 
fluorescence by a nanoshell dimer (a pair of Ag or 
Au nanoshells) is studied by the use of the multiple 
multi-pole (MMP) method. A two-stage model is 
used to analyze the fluorescence process: the 
excitation and the following emission stages. The 
molecule is assumed located within the dimer’s gap. 
For the first stage, the amplification of local-field 
intensity is calculated by a model of an incident 
plane wave illuminating the dimer. Further, for the 
emission stage, the normalized nonradiative and 
radiative decay rates of an electric dipole (the 
excited molecule) in the presence of the dimer are
