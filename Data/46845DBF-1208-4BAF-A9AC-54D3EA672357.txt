Abstract 
Production high content FOSs from sucrose with the use of two broken mycelia of 
intracellular enzymes immobilized separately in calcium alginate to remove glucose in an 
internal-loop airlift reactor has been investigated in this study.  The internal-loop airlift reactor 
made of transparent Plexiglas comprises an external column and a riser.  The entrapped broken 
mycelia for A. japonicus and A. niger in the calcium alginate are 1% and 7% (w/v), respectively.  
When 60 g mycelia-immobilized particles of A. japonicus were supplied into the airlift reactor 
filling 3 liters of sucrose solution with an initial concentration of 300 g/l and gas velocity 7.32 
cm/s, the total produced FOSs were determined to be about 50% w/w of total sugars in the 
mixture after a batch reaction for 10 hours.  Under the same particle loading and operating 
conditions, the second mycelia-immobilized particles of A. niger is added into the airlift reactor.  
The result shows that the FOSs mass fraction is increased with increasing the second particle 
loading of the A. niger to 262.5g, beyond which the FOSs mass fraction remains constant (about 
90% w/w).   
 
Introduction  
 Fructooligosaccharides (FOSs), including 1-kestose (GF2), nystose (GF3), and 
1f-Î²-fructofuranosyl nystose (GF4), currently have received particular attention and commercially 
produced in response to an increasing demand from the consumer for so-called health foods 
(Hidaka et al., 1988).  The mixture of FOSs is used as a nondigestible sweetener for humans and 
exhibits a physiological benefit for improving the growth of the intestinal population of Bifidus 
bacteria.  These fructose oligomers can be produced from sucrose through the 
transfructosylating action of enzymes subsisting in various microorganisms and plants. Generally, 
in the process of FOSs production with fructose-transferring enzyme alone, the maximum FOSs 
conversion yield ranged only 55-60% (w/w) due to unreacted sucrose and glucose (Chiang et al., 
1997).  For some special purposes, production of pure or high-content FOSs syrups is required.  
Although several additional separation and purification processes have been employed, the extra 
processing cost presses the economical view worse.  From the analysis of enzymatic kinetics, it 
was found that glucose can inhibit the transfructosylating reaction (Yun et al., 1993; Jung et al., 
1989).  Hence, a mixed enzyme system, with fructose-transferring enzyme and glucose oxidase, 
was proposed to produce high yield FOSs (up to 90-98%) (Sheu et al., 2001; Yun and Song, 
1993).  However, these researches were carried out with free enzymes or mycelia, which may 
not be an industrial effective way to produce FOSs.  The use of immobilized enzymes or 
mycelia can improve this issue via physical entrapments or chemical binding on calcium alginate 
gel, gluten, and porous silica or glass. 
1-kestose at 16 h.  However, the total FOSs declined gradually after that.    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By adding different amount of (7%w/w) calcium alginate gel particles entrapping mycelia of 
A. niger into the same condition as above, Figure 3 shows the time-course kinetics of the total 
mass fraction of FOSs.  From Figure 3, it is noted that the maximum value of the total mass 
fraction of FOSs reaches to 90% (w/w) as increasing the input amount of A. niger calcium 
alginate gel particles up to 315g, after which no further increasing the maximum value.  Also, 
taking the slope of initial FOSs mass fraction changing with time, Figure 4 demonstrates that the 
initial reaction rate is enhanced by increasing the input amount of calcium alginate gel particles.  
This can be attributed that the inhibitor, glucose, has been successfully oxidized by glucose 
oxidase and diminished the concentration during the time-course, as shown in Figure 5.  As 
loading insufficient amount of A. niger calcium alginate gel particles, the glucose and fructose 
concentration initially increases to a maximum value, then gradually reduces.  Actually, the 
supply of oxygen is still enough and keeps at a certain value, as shown in Figure 6.   As the 
loading reaching 315g, there is only some glucose existing in the system initially, but after 12 h, 
no glucose remaining.  This can be proved from Figure 6 that DO decreases at the beginning due 
to the consumption of the glucose.  As reaching 12 h, DO dramatically increase to 100% which 
means that no glucose to consume the oxygen.
