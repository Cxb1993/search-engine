4. 結果與討論  
本 計 劃 所 呈 現 的 結 果 ， 是 以 Ne=0.124 、
Nl=1.0146×10-3、S0=341.3、D=6.41、Y=1.71×10-4[13]
和 01.0=l 計算所得。 
圖一所示，為 5.0=υ 時，電子溫度與晶格溫度
的暫態分布情形。 1.0=ξ 時，還處於加熱初期，加熱
量不多，電子溫度與晶格溫度尚低。隨著時間的增
長，加熱量的增加，電子溫度與晶格溫度明顯升高。
在Ne=0.124和Nl=1.0146×10-3的條件下，由Ne和Nl的定
義，可瞭解晶格與電子的偶合係數微小，晶格的比熱
值遠大於電子的比熱值，所以電子溫度與晶格溫度間
存有明顯差距。時間到達 5.1=ξ ，脈衝加熱機已停
止，但是電子與晶格的溫度差仍大，電子與晶格間的
傳熱旺盛，電子溫度不升反降。 
圖二呈現延遲時間υ 值對 3.0=ξ 的溫度分布效
應。在有限速度熱傳遞理論中，延遲時間υ 值越大，
熱傳遞速度越慢，熱量越不易傳開，所以 5.1=υ 時，
5.00 ≤≤η 區間的溫度明顯高於 15.0 ≤≤η 區間的溫
度。而 1.0=υ 時，熱傳遞速度增大，所以區間的溫度
差變小。值得注意的是， 5.0=υ 時， 15.0 ≤≤η 區間
的溫度明顯高於 5.00 ≤≤η 區間的溫度。其原因是脈
衝波峰，此時正移動至後端面。由圖二(b)的晶格溫度
分布，可理解此現象。 
在 3.0=ξ 時，各延遲時間υ 值所對應的電子氣
內部的熱通量，如圖三所示。由圖二(b)的晶格溫度分
布理解到，傳至晶格的熱量與υ 值成反比。換言之，
υ 值越大電子氣內部的熱通量越小。就如圖三所展示
的。另一方面，雷射脈衝區間 pt 的減小，υ 值會增大；
從無因次時間ξ 的定義，該值會隨雷射脈衝區間 pt 的
減小而變小。所以，相同的ξ 值， pt 變小，實際時間
值也變小，以致電子與晶格未得到足夠的熱交換時
間，仍有較大量的熱能存在電子氣內傳遞。 
依據(3)式的描述，變形潛勢正比於電子氣溫度
和其溫度分佈梯度。由圖二(a)可觀察到， 5.1=υ 的
電子氣溫度和其溫度分布梯度比 1.0=υ 、0.5和1.0來
得高，所以圖四所顯現的變形量也較大。如圖二(a)
上的結果， 5.0=υ 時，受到熱波移動的影響，電子
氣溫度分布梯度由負值變成正值，變形量U值就由正
值轉變為負值。而薄膜內的熱應力為變形量U的空間
梯度所影響。換句話說，薄膜內的熱應力會隨正負交
變的熱變形而正負交變，具有產生疲勞破壞的可能
性。

ABSTRACT 
The heat flux will decay exponentially with the distance 
from the heating surface, while laser, microwave, or ultrasound 
is used to heat on a tissue. This work would use the thermal 
wave model of bioheat transfer to analyze the thermal response 
in a perfused tissue subjected to such a spatial heating. A 
modified discretization scheme based on the Laplace transform 
is proposed to solve the present problem. In analysis process, 
the surface convection effect is taken into account. The effects 
of perfusion rate, relaxation time, and the conditions set for the 
interior boundary on the behavior of bioheat transfer are 
discussed. 
Keywords: Bioheat transfer; Laplace transform; Modified 
discretization; Thermal wave model 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Hyperthermia has been applied clinically for about 30 
years. Present technology for superficial hyperthermia is based 
on external laser, microwave, or ultrasound techniques [1,2]. 
For treatment quality, spatial control of the temperature 
distribution is an absolute necessity. Due to simplicity and 
validity, the Pennes bioheat transfer model is commonly used 
to simulate thermal behavior of hyperthermia in biological 
bodies [2-4]. In accordance with the contents of the literatures 
[5-7], thermal behavior in nonhomogenous media needs a 
relaxation time to accumulate enough energy to transfer to the 
nearest element. In reality, the living tissues are highly 
nonhomogenous, and the velocity of heat transfer in tissues 
should be limited. The Pennes bioheat equation describes the 
thermal behavior based on the classical Fourier’s law. It is well 
known that Fourier’s law depicts an infinitely fast propagation 
of thermal signal, obviously incompatible with physical reality. 
To solve the paradox occurred in the Pennes model, Liu et. al. 
[8] introduced the thermal wave model of bioheat transfer for 
the investigation of physical mechanisms and the behaviors in 
thermal wave propagation in living tissues. 
A few literatures have reported the value of relaxation time 
in biological bodies. The literatures [5-7] presented it to be 20-
30 s. Mitra et al. [9] discovered the relaxation time is of the 
order of 15 s for processed meat, and reconfirmed the order of 
magnitude of the values obtained by Kaminski [6]. Herwing 
and Beckers [10] held a controversy against Graβmann and 
Peters [11] for that no evidence of relaxation thermal behavior 
exists in materials with nonhomogenous inner structure. To 
solve this controversy, Roetzel et al. [12] experimentally 
investigated the relaxation thermal behavior in nonhomogenous 
materials, and obtained the value of relaxation time about 2 s 
for processed meat. The statements in the literatures [13, 14] 
indicated that the larger the value of the relaxation time of heat 
transfer medium, the more dominant the wave like behavior of 
heat transfer. Yang [15] further expressed thermal shock 
phenomenon in tissues from biothermomechanical viewpoint. 
Obvious, the wave-like behavior of bioheat transfer received 
much attention from the issued literatures. In fact, the 
relaxation time also exists in homogenous materials such as 
common metals, but every short, only from 10-8 s to 10-14 s [5-
7]. Therefore, the behaviors of finite heat propagation are 
difficult to be observed in homogenous substances. 
The rational prediction of temperature distribution is 
helpful to the development of hyperthermia. To take account 
the finite heat propagation effects for more realistic predictions, 
this work would employ the thermal wave model of bioheat 
transfer to analyzes the thermal behavior in perfused tissue 
induced by the heating source, which decays exponentially with 
the distance from the heating surface. As Lu et al. [16] 
described, the fundamental solution of the thermal wave model 
of bioheat transfer is extremely hard to obtain. To crack the 
mathematical difficulties encountered in the present problem, a 
modified discretization scheme based on the Laplace transform 
method is developed. For prevention against burn injury in the 
health tissues near the skin surface, a surface cooling is often 
necessary during heating. Thus, the effect of surface convection 
on the thermal distribution is considered. In the same time, the 
boundary condition at interior of the biological bodies has been 
regarded as no heat flux or constant temperature [8], so the 
effects of the boundary condition deep in tissue on the wave

Substituting Eqs. (18) - (20) into Eq. (21) can produce the 
discretized form for the present problem at the ith node. 
Rearrangement of the discretized form at each node in 
conjunction with the discretized form of the boundary 
conditions yields the following matrix equation as 
[ ]{ } { }FB =θ~  (22) 
where [ ]B  is a matrix with the complex number s, { }θ~ is a 
column vector representing the unknown nodal evaluation 
temperatures in the Laplace transform domain, and { }F  is a 
column vector representing the forcing term. Thereafter, the 
application of the Gaussian elimination algorithm and the 
numerical inversion of the Laplce transform to Eq. (22) can 
yield the nodal temperatures in the physical domain [21, 22]. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The present results are for the temperature of the cooling 
medium CT of 15=  and the time-dependent heating power 
P(t) = 2500u(t) W/m, u(t) is unit function. Because the interior 
tissue temperature usually tends to a constant within a short 
distance such as 2-3 cm [2], this work defines the distance 
between skin surface and the body core as L = 3 cm. A few 
thermal properties of the sample skin are regarded as K = 0.5 
W/m⋅ oC, ρ = 1000 kg/m3 and C = Cb = 4200 J/kg⋅ oC [8]. The 
values of the other parameters would be individually specified 
for each calculation. All computations are performed with β = 
200 m-1 and the distance between two neighboring nodes l = 
0.0002 m. 
Fig. 1 presents the transient thermal profiles for τ = 20 s, h 
= 100 W/m2⋅ oC, and Wb = 0.5 kg/m3⋅ s. The effects of the 
boundary condition at x = L are also illustrated. As τ = 20 s, the 
heat flux is not prevailed in the vicinity of the boundary x = L 
for t = 50 s and 150 s. The boundary condition at x = L has not 
affected the temperature distributions yet. At t = 50 s, the 
phenomenon of wave-like propagation is quite obvious and a 
peak temperature is induced at about x = tCK ×τρ = 
0.00386m. As t = 900 s, the accumulation of heat energy raises 
the temperature and the curve of temperature distribution is 
upward nearby x = L for the adiabatic boundary condition. 
Correspondingly, heat energy is transferred away from the 
tissue for the cooling function of the constant temperature 
boundary condition at x = L. These above results express that 
the effect of the condition at the interior boundary maybe not 
serious for a short period heating. However, the boundary 
condition at the interior tissue will seriously affect the 
temperature distribution for the intensive and long time heating.

Fig. 2 shows the effect of relaxation time on the 
temperature distributions with h = 100 W/m2⋅ oC, and Wb = 0.5 
kg/m3⋅ s for t = 50 s and t = 450 s. The relaxation time is the 
main parameter making the propagation velocity of heat finite. 
Traditionally, the Pennes bioheat equation is used to predict the 
behaviors of bioheat transfer with 0=τ s, which the 
propagation velocity is regarded as infinite. It is found from 
Fig. 2a that the temperature and the temperature gradient in the 
neighborhood of the thermal wave front are higher for τ = 30 s. 
The comparison between Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b demonstrates the 
non-Fourier effect dissipates with time, and the thermal 
behavior of finite propagation approaches that described by the 
traditional model. It is also observed from Figs. 2a and 2b that 
the location of the thermal wave front at a specific time is the 
same for the adiabatic boundary condition and the constant 
temperature boundary condition at x = L. This result implies 
that the propagation speed is independent of the boundary 
condition type. On the other hand, numerical oscillations are 
easily happen around the sharp discontinuities in numerical 
analysis. There is no numerical oscillation around the sharp 
wave front. It evidences the efficiency of the present numerical 
scheme for such a problem. 
The heat loss at the skin surface would affect the 
temperature distribution in the tissue. It is well known that  the

Fig. 5 Effect of the blood perfusion rate Wb on the 
variations of temperature at: (a) x = 0.005m and 
(b) x = 0.025m 
 
The adjustment of temperature is one of the functions of 
blood circulation in a living tissue. The effect of the perfusion 
rate on the bioheat transfer is needed to pay attention. Due to 
numerousness and complexity of blood vessel, the status of 
convection heat transfer of blood in a perfused tissue is very 
complicated. It is quite difficult to completely describe the 
behavior of heat transfer of blood. Liu et. al. [8] simulated it 
with heat source term in the thermal wave model of bioheat 
transfer, same as the Pennes bioheat transfer equation. The 
effect of the blood perfusion rate Wb on the variations of 
temperature at x = 0.005m and x = 0.025m with h = 100 W/m2⋅ 
oC and τ = 20 s is plotted in Fig. 5. The blood perfusion 
develops a cooling function, since the tissue temperature is 
higher than the arterial temperature. At the initial times, the 
difference between the tissue temperature and the arterial 
temperature is small, and the heat energy carried off by the 
perfusion blood is few. Therefore, the transient temperatures 
for Wb = 0. kg/m3, Wb = 1. kg/m3 and Wb = 2.0 kg/m3 do not 
have obvious difference as 0s < t < 150s. After that, the 
difference increases with time for the cooling function of the 
blood perfusion. The heat energy taken away by the blood is 
proportional to the perfusion rate. The magnitude of the 
transient temperature decreases for the larger the blood 
perfusion rate. It is found from Fig.5b that the cooling function 
at the boundary x = L for the constant temperature condition is 
more effective than the blood perfusion. It is also observed 
from Fig.5a that the jump discontinues locate at the same 
position for Wb = 0. kg/m3, Wb = 1. kg/m3 and Wb = 2.0 kg/m3. It 
shows that the propagation velocity of bioheat transfer is not 
concerned with the perfusion rate. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
A modified discretization scheme based on the Laplace 
transform is employed to solve a transient bioheat transfer 
problem with the finite propagation effect. The rational and 
stable computation results show the efficiency of the present 
numerical scheme. It is known that the condition assumption at 
the interior boundary is important and would affect the 
rationality of the analysis results. The blood perfusion develops 
the adjustment function for the temperature distribution in the 
tissue and is independent of the thermal propagation velocity. It 
is possible that the tissue temperature can not be raised to 
expected level while a surface cooling is employed. The 
regulation of the surface cooling is required for an optimum 
heating.
