Abstract 
Determining customer requirements and 
the relationship between customer 
requirements and technical measures is a 
typical group decision-making process in 
QFD by a group comprised of people. 
Generally, different and/or even subjective 
opinions are happened often in a group 
decision-making process due to the 
limitations of experience and vagueness. 
Decision makers have different decision 
makers’ preferences, such as optimistic, 
conservative, and neutral risk-taking attitudes. 
Under such circumstances, the study is to 
propose the fuzzy group decision-making 
model with risk-taking attitudes based on the 
combination of the improved fuzzy 
preference relation model and fuzzy 
suitability index ranking method can be 
applied in analyzing the importance weights 
 3 
product planning matrix is also regarded as 
the house of quality (HOQ).

However, during an individual 
decision-making process, many studies never 
analyze the importance weight of WHATs 
and the relationship between WHATs and 
HOWs by considering the information 
obtained from group decision-making 
processes with different risk-taking attitudes 
due to various and subjective opinions of the 
customers and the cross-functional team 
members in identifying the importance 
weight and the relationship. Consequently, 
we should make use of a fuzzy group 
decision-making model with risk-taking 
attitudes in QFD to resolve and manage 
group decision-making processes with 
fuzziness and different individual preferences 
such as optimistic, neutral, and conservative 
attitudes.  
 A fuzzy group decision-making model with 
risk-taking attitudes is proposed and applied 
in QFD to deal with group decision-making 
processes in this study. The importance of 
each customer requirement and the 
relationship between customer requirements 
and technical measures are identified by a 
group of people with the individual 
preferences such as optimistic, neutral, and 
conservative attitudes.

3.1 Improved Fuzzy Preference Relation 
Li (1999) has proposed an improved 
fuzzy preference relation to solve the 
previous drawback such as the approaches 
proposed by Nakamura (1986) and Yuan 
(1991), and a fuzzy model associated with 
the solution algorithm is suggested on the 
basis of an -level weighted. Some steps of a 
stepwise-described algorithm of the fuzzy 
model (Li, 1999; Liu and Wu, 2008) are 
introduced and presented simply as follows: 
Such as in step 4, aggregate fuzzy 
performance ratings with fuzzy weights by 
means of extended multiplication to form an 
importance weighted, comprehensive 
decision matrix E, in which jijij wse ⊗=  is a 
fuzzy number with parabolic membership 
functions in the form of, based upon 
Kaufmann and Gupta (1985),

    Step 5 is to define each alternative as a

means of extended addition and scalar

presented in Equation (2).

Decision-Making 
A stepwise-described algorithm of the 
fuzzy group decision-making model with 
risk-taking attitudes based on the 
combination of the fuzzy method with

(Li, 1999) and ranking fuzzy suitability

??????? 
To illustrate the proposed model, 
assume a more complicated QFD, for the 
sake of simplicity, has three customer 
requirements divided into primary and 
secondary levels, denoted CR and five 
technical measures, denoted TM. Assume 
there are 7 customers involved in 
determining the weight for each CR, and 
there are 9 members in a cross-functional 
team to assess the relationship between CR 
and TM. To apply the algorithm developed in 
Section 4 by the combination of the fuzzy 
method with solution algorithm in group 
decision-making (Li, 1999) and ranking 
fuzzy suitability indices (Chen, 1985; Kim 
and Park, 1990; Liang and Wang, 1993; 
Wang and Kerre, 2001), the descriptions are 
step by step and summarized in the following: 
In Step 1, the linguistic values of the 
importance weight for each CR and the 
relationship between CR and TM should be 
defined. In this example, five ranks are used, 
where CR = {VL (Very low), L (Low), M 
(Middle), H (High), VH (Very high)} and the 
relationship between CR and TM is {VW 
(Very weak), W (Weak), M (Medium), S 
(Strong), VS (Very strong)}. The reasonable 
normal fuzzy numbers with triangular 
membership functions for CR and the 
relationship between CR and TM are 
identified. Seven customers were asked to 
assess the importance weight of each CR at 
the secondary level, where the customers’ 
opinions are quite diversified. On the other 
hand, the relationships between CR and TM 
are assessed by a cross-functional team with 
nine members. 
In Step 2, aggregate fuzzy importance 
weights for each CR at the secondary level 
through seven customers by applying 
Equation (9). The fuzzy importance weights 
of these customer requirements at the 
secondary level are obtained. Step 3 is to 
aggregate fuzzy importance weights for each 
CR at the primary level through aggregating 
fuzzy importance weights for each CR at the 
secondary level by applying Equation (10). 
The fuzzy importance weights of three 
customer requirements at the primary level 
are obtained. Step 4 is to aggregate fuzzy 
relationship between CR and TM at the 
primary level of CR, applying Equation (11), 
through nine cross-functional team members, 
and the fuzzy relationship is summarized. In 
Step 5, a weighted and comprehensive 
decision matrix can be established by 
applying extended multiplication discussed 
in Equation (12), where qmf denotes 
quadratic membership function shown in the 
following: 
0.279qmf = (0.043, 0.133, 0.103 /0.279/ 0.03, 
 9 
customer requirements and five technical 
measures in order to simply show how this 
proposed model works. Customer 
requirements are broken down into primary 
and secondary levels in QFD. Finally, the 
proposed model applied in the hypermarket 
shows that the first priority of the service 
elements (technical measure) is the location 
and facility layout of the hypermarket. In 
short, different people tend to reflect diverse 
risk-taking attitudes, such as optimistic, 
neutral, and conservative attitudes, in making 
decisions. Under the conditions, a fuzzy 
group decision-making model with 
risk-taking attitudes can be used in QFD to 
resolve and manage with a group 
decision-making process when the 
information is ambiguous and vague. Besides, 
an example is presented to illustrate this 
fuzzy group decision-making model with 
risk-taking attitudes can be effectively 
applied in QFD including customer 
requirements at the two-level hierarchy to 
accurately and convincingly make decisions 
and identify the importance of each technical 
measure with different risk-taking attitudes 
of the decision-makers.
