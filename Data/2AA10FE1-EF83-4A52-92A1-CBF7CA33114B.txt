4I. Face-Centered Cubic Lattice of Spherical Micelles in Block
Copolymer/Homopolymer Blends
Abstract
Spherical micelles of block copolymers may arrange into macrolattices in the
bulk, in the blends with homopolymers, and in the solutions with low molecular
weight solvents. In this study, we present the first experimental observation on the
face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice of spherical micelles in diblock
copolymer/homopolymer blends based on the blend of a symmetric poly(ethylene
oxide)-block-poly(1,4-butadiene) (PEO-b-PB) and a PB homopolymer. The FCC
lattice at elevated temperatures is verified through small angle X-ray scattering and
transmission electron microscopy. The thermally-induced phase transition on
heating is found to proceed through an order-order transition from body-centered
cubic (BCC) to FCC phase followed by an order-disorder transition from FCC
packing to disordered micelles and eventually to a homogeneous melt with only
thermal concentration fluctuations.
Introduction
Molecular self-assembly in diblock copolymers, A-b-B, may generate a series of
long-range ordered microdomains depending on the strength of interblock repulsion
and composition of the constituting blocks.1-4 The classical structures include
lamellae, cylinder, and sphere, and complex structures such as gyroid phase have also
been disclosed.5-9 The geometry of microdomain formed is largely determined by
the competition between the interfacial tension at domain interface and the stress in
the stretched chains. The block chains are stretched since the chains confined in the
respective domains must satisfy the melt incompressibility that requires the two
phases to attain their normal liquid densities.
In highly asymmetric diblock melts, the minority blocks (e.g. B blocks) assemble
into spherical microdomains with A blocks tethered to the domain interface, yielding
spherical micelles consisting of a core and a coronal shell. These micelles may
organize into macrolattices, where body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice is the only
6observed in A-b-B/A blends.
Another type of block copolymer micelles are formed in the solutions with
selective low molecular weight solvents, where interactions between polymer and
solvent in the coronal layers plays an important role in micelle ordering in the
semidilute and concentrated regimes. FCC lattice in this type of system has been
identified in a number of cases.28-32 McConnell et al. observed the FCC phase over
certain concentration range in the solutions of polystyrene-block-polyisoprene
(PS-b-PI) and decane.28 The lattice structures were found to correlate with the ratio
of coronal layer thickness to core radius, where a thinner corona favored the
formation of FCC lattice. Pople et al. identified the thermally-induced transition
between BCC and FCC lattices in the aqueous solutions of
poly(oxyethylene)-block-poly(oxybutylene).31 The transition into FCC phase upon
heating was postulated to be driven by the decrease in coronal layer thickness due to
the poorer solvation of poly(oxyethylene) blocks at higher temperatures. FCC lattice
has also been reported recently by Hanley et al. for PS-b-PI dissolved in diethyl
phthalate, a good solvent for PS but poor for PI.32
In this study, we will present the experimental evidence on the existences of FCC
lattice, thermally-induced BCC-FCC order-order transition (OOT), and ODT from
FCC to disordered micelle phase in A-b-B/A blends based on the blend of a
poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(1,4-butadiene) (PEO-b-PB) and a PB homopolymer.
A symmetric PEO-b-PB which displayed lamellar morphology in the melt was
blended with a PB homopolymer, yielding PEO spherical microdomains in the matrix
composed of wet-brush type blends of PB homopolymer and PB blocks tethered at
PEO spheres.33 The macrolattices in the resultant blend will be probed by using
small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Experimental Section
The symmetric PEO-b-PB with the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 1.04 was
synthesized by sequential anionic polymerization of butadiene and ethylene oxide
(Polymer Source, Inc.). Mn of the PEO and PB blocks was 6000 and 5000,
respectively. The 1,4-addition PB homopolymer with Mn = 2600 and Mw/Mn = 1.04
8OsO4(aq) for 2 hrs.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 compares the SAXS profile collected in-situ at 183 oC with that
measured in-situ at 123 oC. The lattice peaks arising from the inter-microdomain
interference of the scattered field are marked by thin arrows, while bold opened
arows pinpoint the peaks arising from the form factor scatering (denoted by ‘i = n” 
with n = 1, 2,…) from isolated spherical domains.33,37 The average radius of PEO
spheres (<R>) deduced from the positions of the form factor maxima is 7.5 nm, as the
dotted line signifies the form factor profile of spheres calculated by assuming <R> =
7.5 nm and the standard deviation of R, R = 0.72 nm (Gaussian distribution was
adopted for R distribution). The SAXS patterns at these temperatures are different in
terms of the relative positions of the lattice scattering maxima. At 123 oC, the lattice
peaks display relative positions closely relevant to BCC symmetry as usually
expected. Strikingly different features are identified in the scattering pattern
measured at 183 oC, where a shoulder clearly appears beside the primary lattice peak.
The position of this shoulder relative to that of the primary peak is (4/3)1/2, which
conflicts with the position of any of the higher-order peaks for a BCC lattice. At this
temperature, the relative positions of the majority of peaks (labeled in the figure)
closely follow those prescribed by a FCC lattice.38 The SAXS pattern is actually
very similar to those reported for the FCC structures in the solutions of PS-b-PI with
low molecular weight solvents.28,32 It is noted that the weak shoulders observed near
q/qm ≈ 1.4and 2.2 nm-1, not assignable to FCC lattice, may stem from the presence of
residual BCC phase.
In addition to FCC packing, HCP represents the other type of close-packed
arrangement. According to the SCMF calculation by Matsen, these two types of
lattice are essentially degenerate in free energy, and any energy difference is expected
to be insignificant in comparison to nonequilibrium effects.24 The scattering features
of HCP lattice are briefly described in the Appendix. Table 1 tabulates the lattice
planes and relative positions of the corresponding diffraction peaks for ideal HCP
packing. Since the scattering peaks of such a lattice are closely spaced and some of
the positions lie in the vicinity to those of FCC lattice, it may be speculated that a
10
graphics program, TEMS, capable of generating the TEM images projected from
arbitrary planes in the macrolattices including BCC and FCC symmetries.39-41 It is
found that BCC lattice can never generate the image observed in Figure 3. On the
contrary, FCC lattice can yield the observed image (as shown in Figure 4b) if the
ultrathin section is cut parallel to (111) planes and the specimen contains two layers
(say, B and C) of spheres with the spheres in plane B fully contained in the thin
section (giving rise to the image of bright spheres) and those in plane C partially
contained in the specimen (yielding the image of gray spheres). It should be noted
that the agreement between the TEMS image and the observed TEM image alone may
not completely rule out other symmetries except for BCC and simple cubic lattice,
while a combination of SAXS and TEM results has offered a solid evidence for the
existence of FCC lattice.
The mechanism for the formation of close-packed arrangement is usually
rationalized by the relief of packing frustration of coronal block chains.24,42 In neat
diblocks, stretching of coronal blocks tethered at the spheres is not uniform because a
portion of them have to stretch more to fit into the vertices of Wigner-Seitz cells in the
matrix phase to produce a CMC surface under the constraint of melt
incompressibility.42 Such a packing frustration is stronger in a BCC lattice than in a
FCC lattice because the corresponding Wigner-Seitz cell in the former is a truncated
octahedron while that in the later is a rhombic dodecahedron. Therefore, FCC
packing is favored in terms of relief of packing frustration. On the other hand,
BCC-packed micelles have smaller interface-to-volume ratio (S/V with S being the
total interfacial area and V being the total volume) under a given sphere volume
fraction. Spherical micelles then prefer BCC packing if interfacial energy dominates
the relief of packing frustration. This is particularly plausible at low temperatures
since the interblock repulsion is strong (i.e. large ). Increasing temperature or
loweringtends to alleviate the effect of interfacial tension, where the spheres could
split into smaller size (i.e., the association number decreases), thereby allowing them
to rearrange into a FCC lattice to release packing frustration.
In A-b-B/A blends, presence of hompoplymer could alleviate packing frustration
in that a portion of homopolymer chains may be localized near the vertices of the
Wigner-Seitz cells, thereby permitting the coronal blocks originally reaching the
12
FCC phase tends to grow at the expense of BCC phase. The transition from BCC to
FCC lattice is found to occur at temperatures ranging from 135 to 163 oC over the
time scale (60 mins) associated with each SAXS measurement. The transition range
could be narrower if the annealing time at each temperature becomes longer.
At this point it would be of worthy to note a possible reason why the BCC-FCC
transition was observed for the present PEO-b-PB/PB system but not for other bulk
systems, such as PS-b-PI and its blends with corresponding homopolymers. A
PS-b-PI (SS-7 in ref. 43 or SI-2 in ref. 44 with Mn = 1.9 x 104, Mw/Mn = 1.02 and fPS
= 0.46) has number average degree of polymerization Nn = 220 similar to the
PEO-b-PB used here (Nn = 229). The PS-b-PI has TODT = 142 oC, where the
PEO-b-PB has TODT > 220 oC, indicating that the latter has a larger . Since the
strength of thermal noise B is given by B ~ (N)-1/2N-1/2,44-45 for a given N and fA ( =
NA/(NA+NB)), B is expected to be smaller for PEO-b-PB than for PS-b-PI, and hence
FCC phase may be less disturbed to the thermal fluctuation effects for PEO-b-PB than
for PS-b-PI, which may explain the reason pointed out in the beginning of this
paragraph.
In addition to the BCC-FCC transition, we are also interested in revealing if
further phase transition is accessible at even higher temperatures for the present
system. Figure 6 presents a series of SAXS profiles obtained at T ≥ 183 oC, again
plotted against q/qm. It can be seen that the higher-order lattice peaks and the form
factor peak start to diminish on further heating from 183 oC. It should be noted that
the form factor peak is a broad scattering peak (labeled by the arrows) appearing
above the background level drawn by the dashed line. The ripples superposed on the
broad form factor peak may reflect either higher-order lattice diffractions or noise.
Only the primary peak is identified along with a broad shoulder at q/qm≈ 1.7 and a 
weak form factor scattering at 215 oC, indicating the microdomains have lost their
long-range order and the system contains disordered micelles.14-16 These micelles
gradually dissociates (through the demicellization process) with increasing
temperature, and the form factor peaks become negligible in the SAXS profiles above
220 oC, indicating that the system may have attained a homogeneous state with only
thermal concentration fluctuations. It should be noted that the changes of SAXS
patterns were by no means due to any chemical reactions that might occur at high
14
sphere-forming PEO-b-PB. This study is currently in progress in our laboratory.

Appendix. Relative Positions of the Diffraction Peaks of HCP
Lattice
FCC and HCP represent the possible types of close-packed arrangement. HCP
lattice is characterized by the packing of spherical micelles in the ABABAB...
stacking sequence while FCC structure coresponds to the ABCABC… stacking (see 
Figure 4). Verification of HCP arrangement from the SAXS profile is not as
straightforward as that for the cubic cells, since the diffraction planes as well as the
relative positions of the lattice peaks are not fixed but depend upon the axial ratio of
the unit cell, c/a.38 For an ideal HCP lattice of spheres, c/a = 1.633, and the
coresponding difraction planes, indexed by (hk•l), are listed in Table 1 (along with 
those associated with BCC and FCC structures for comparison).38 The lattice
spacing d(hk•l)is given by the following equation for the hexagonal lattice38
Because d(hk•l)= 2/qm(hk•l) (qm(hk•l)= position of the corresponding diffraction peak)
and c = 1.633a, Eq. (1) can be transformed into the following equation for calculating
the relative positions of the lattice peaks associated with the HCP lattice:
The relative peak positions obtained from Eq. (2) are shown in Table 1.

II. Precursor-Driven BCC-FCC Order-Order Transition of
Sphere-Forming Block Copolymer/Homopolymer Blend
Abstract
We disclose a precursor-driven order-order transition (OOT) between BCC and
FCC lattices in a sphere-forming blend of a poly(ethylene
oxide)-block-poly(1,4-butadiene) (PEO-b-PB) and a PB homopolymer (h-PB). The
blend as cast from toluene exhibited a metastable trapped FCC (t-FCC) phase, which
showed no sign of transformation into BCC phase on heating to 260 oC. Annealing
the as-cast blend at –20 oC disturbed the long-range order due to crystallization of
PEO within the spherical microdomains. A significant portion of the rather
disorderly arranged crystalline domains relaxed to pack into the equilibrium BCC
lattice when the PEO crystals were melted at elevated temperatures. The BCC
grains thus developed then acted as the precursor to induce a transformation of t-FCC
phase to BCC phase on heating to 205 oC. Since t-FCC phase was not completely
wiped out through this process, a BCC-to-FCC OOT assisted by the residual t-FCC
precursor set in on heating from 205 to 260 oC where FCC became the stable packing
symmetry. Subsequent cooling from 260 oC recovered the BCC phase and the blend
cooled to 110 oC was essentially FCC free. Due to the absence of FCC grain, the
thermodynamically prescribed BCC-to-FCC OOT could no longer take place on
reheating. Our results revealed the necessity of BCC or FCC precursor for initiating
the relevant OOT and hence implied high activation barrier associated with the
transition. The activation barrier was proposed to be entropic in origin stemming
from the deformations of PB blocks and h-PB chains in the lattice transition
proceeding through the Bain distortion mechanism.
Introduction
Microphase separation in diblock copolymer (A-b-B) and its blend with the
corresponding homopolymer (A-b-B/h-A) may yield a series of long-range ordered
microdomains including lamellae, gyroid, cylinders, and spheres.1-10 Under the
constraint of melt incompressibility, the domain geometry is principally determined
by the interplay between the interfacial tension and the entropic penalty associated
with the stretching of the block chains and h-A chains (in the case of A-b-B/h-A) and
24
form of FCC lattice has been disclosed in a blend of a symmetric poly(ethylene
oxide)-block-poly(1,4-butadiene) (PEO-b-PB) and a h-PB in our previous study.21
This system was demonstrated to undergo a series of thermally-induced phase
transition on heating, including an order-order transition (OOT) from BCC to FCC
phase, an order-disordered transition (ODT) from FCC to disordered micelle phase,
and eventually demicellization to a homogeneous melt with only thermal
concentration fluctuations. It is noteworthy that BCC-FCC OOT of spherical
micelles has also been identified in a number of diblock copolymer solutions with
selective low molecular weight solvents,22-29 in which the unlike interactions between
the block chains and the solvent played a role in micelle ordering.
As an extension of our previous work,21 the present study centers on testing the
thermal reversibility of BCC-FCC OOT in PEO-b-PB/h-PB blend through SAXS
heating and cooling experiments. Instead of the PEO-b-PB sample used
previously,21 another PEO-b-PB consisting of slightly longer PEO block is employed
here, such that a comparison with the previous result allows the effect of PEO block
length on the TOOT of the BCC-FCC transition to be revealed. More importantly, we
will demonstrate that the BCC-FCC OOT is a “precursor-driven”process, where the
transition does not thermodynamic equilibrium if the system does not contain the
BCC or FCC precursor prior to the transition.
Experimental Section
Materials and Sample Preparation. The PEO-b-PB with the polydispersity index
(Mw/Mn) = 1.04 was synthesized by sequential anionic polymerization of butadiene
and ethylene oxide (Polymer Source, Inc.). The Mn of PEO block (Mb,PEO) was 7.5 x
103 and Mn of PB block (Mb,PB) was 5.5 x 10
3. This PEO-b-PB has a slightly longer
PEO block than the sample used in the previous study (Mb,PEO = 6.0 x 103, Mb,PB = 5.0
x 103). The 1,4-addition PB homopolymer with Mn = 2.73 x 103 was also
synthesized by anionic polymerization (Polymer Source, Inc.). The blend with the
overall PEO volume fraction (fPEO) of 0.17 was prepared by solvent casting.
PEO-b-PB and h-PB were first dissolved in toluene at room temperature (ca. 27 oC).
The microphase-separated blend was obtained by removing most of the solvent on a
hot plate at 80 oC, followed by drying in vacuo at 60 oC for 2 hours for complete
26
ratios of 1: (4/3)1/2: (8/3)1/2: (11/3)1/2: (12/3)1/2…correspond to a FCC lattice, while the
ratios of 1: 21/2: 31/2: 41/2… indicate a BCC packing.31,32 In the present study, the
FCC and BCC peaks are marked by the opened and solid arrows in the SAXS profiles,
respectively.
Figure 2(a) and (b) present the SAXS profiles of the as-cast blend collected
in-situ in the heating and subsequent cooling cycles, respectively. Interestingly, the
as-cast blend contains only FCC phase at 30 oC (i.e., the onset of the heating
experiment) as neither 21/2 nor 31/2 BCC peak is identified in the profile. This FCC
phase remains stable throughout the heating cycle to 230 oC, and the subsequent
cooling does not induce any structural change neither. This is clearly in conflict with
the observation reported in our previous findings,21 where BCC  FCC transition
occurred in the blend with shorter PEO block in the heating cycle starting from 123
oC. This discrepancy, as will be demonstrated later in this chapter, can be resolved
by considering that a BCC/FCC precursor is necessary to initiate the relevant
BCC-FCC OOT. For instance, the system studied in our previous work contained a
small fraction of FCC phase (which is formed during solvent casting) at 123 oC as
manifested by a weak (8/3)1/2 FCC peak (cf. Figure 1 in ref. 21). This FCC phase
served as the precursor which initiated the BCC  FCC OOT in the heating cycle.
This kind of“precursor-driven”effect will be demonstrated more systematically in the
following SAXS results for the blend with longer PEO block.
Figure 3 shows a series of SAXS profiles of the blend having been subjected to
annealing at -20 oC collected in the heating cycle from 100 to 260 oC. In contrast to
the as-cast blend, BCC and FCC phases are found to coexist in the system below 200
oC (cf. Figure 3(a)), as the scattering peaks relevant to both structures are present.
Therefore, the low temperature annealing appears to promote the formation of BCC
phase at the expense of the FCC phase formed in the as-cast state. It can also be
seen from Figure 3(a) that the FCC phase tends to promote its order before the
transition into the BCC phase with increasing temperature toward 200 oC as
manifested in the sharpening of the relevant diffraction peaks. This trend is
particularly clear up to about 173 oC but becomes less clear between 173 and 200 oC,
as the diffraction peak intensity weakens due to a rapid decrease of FCC fraction with
temperature.
28
formation should be associated with the solvent casting process, where the FCC
structure seemingly formed first during the solvent evaporation process was somehow
trapped into the bulk after complete solvent removal. This metastable FCC phase is
thus called “trapped FCC phase”(t-FCC) and its formation mechanism will be
illustrated in the discussion section.
A reheating experiment was conducted after the blend has been subjected to the
heating and cooling cycles (cf. the thermal protocol in Figure 1(b)). Figure 5 shows
the SAXS profiles collected in-situ in the reheating cycle. At the onset of the
reheating process (i.e. 110 oC) the system adopts nearly complete BCC order.
Interestingly, the BCC  FCC OOT observed in the first heating cycle no longer
occurs up to 260 oC, as BCC phase is found to span to whole temperature window.
This is reminiscent of the results in Figure 2(a) showing that the heating of the as-cast
blend with complete FCC order did not induce any FCC  BCC transition. This
strongly implies that the OOT is feasible if the system contains a BCC/FCC precursor.
Figure 6 displays the temperature dependences of the inverse of the intensity of
the primary scattering peak (Im-1) and the characteristic distance (D = 2/qm) for the
as-cast blend. In this plot, the vertical dash line represents the approximate onset
(170 oC) of the transition boundary between t-FCC and FCC phase upon heating, in
which t-FCC phase is a lattice packing that situates in a metastable state generated
during solvent removal. The boundary between t-FCC and FCC phase is determined
by the slope change of Im-1 in heating run. The temperature dependence of Im-1 in the
cooling cycle is characterized by a smooth curve with the Im-1 values closely agreeing
with those observed in the heating cycle at T > 170 oC. A hysterysis is identified at
T < 170 oC, where the intensities at a given temperature in the heating and cooling
cycles do not agree. Such a hysterysis effect is an indicative of the metastable nature
of the t-FCC phase observed below 170 oC. Similar conclusion can also be drawn
from the D vs. T-1plot.
Figure 6 plots Im-1 against the inverse of absolute temperature for heating,
cooling and reheating cycles for the low-temperature annealed blend which exhibits
BCC-FCC OOT in the heating and cooling cycles. The vertical dash line represents
the approximate onset (200 oC) of the BCC-FCC transition under the temperature
30
170 oC because of the BCC and FCC coexisted phase in the cooled blend (cf. cooling
and reheating cycle).
Discussion
Our SAXS results have revealed the following salient features of the BCC/FCC
phase and the relevant OOT in the sphere-forming PEO-b-PB/h-PB blend:
1. A metastable t-FCC phase formed during solvent casting, and it constituted the
only structure in the as-cast blend. Heating the BCC-free blend did not induce
transformation of the t-FCC phase to BCC phase in the temperature range where
BCC was supposed to be the equilibrium structure. This suggested that a BCC
precursor was required to induce the structure transition.
2. Annealing the as-cast blend at -20 oC induced the formation of the
thermodynamically stable BCC phase out of the t-FCC phase, thereby leading to
coexistence of t-FCC and BCC phase in the system. Owing to the presence of
this BCC precursor, transformation from t-FCC to BCC phase on subsequent
heating became accessible in the temperature window where the later was the
stable structure. The t-FCC phase was however not completely wiped out before
reaching the temperature where FCC became the favorable packing; the residual
t-FCC grains then served as the precursors or nuclei for initiating the BCCFCC
transition upon further heating. The conversion was incomplete on reaching the
maximum experimental temperature (260 oC) as some BCC residue still remained
to act as the precursor to initiate a reverse FCC  BCC OOT in the subsequent
cooling cycle. The conversion to BCC order was complete upon cooling to 110
oC at which the system was essentially FCC free.
3. Due to the lack of FCC precursor, reheating the cooled blend could no longer
induce the BCCFCC OOT.
We will divide our discussions over these features into the following sections.
First we will discuss the conditions at which the BCC or FCC represents the favorable
structure and the driving force of BCC-FCC OOT. We will then point out why the
t-FCC phase can be formed during solvent casting. Finally we will discuss over the
precursor effect by disclosing that the OOT encounters a nucleation barrier associated
with the excess free energy at the boundary between the BCC and FCC grains.

In A-b-B/h-A blend, the h-A chains not solubilized into the micelle corona may
help relieve the packing frustration by localizing into the regions near the vertices of
the W-S cell, thereby permitting the coronal A blocks originally reaching these
regions to relax. This effect should be operative at low temperature where the strong
repulsion between A and B components prohibits complete solubilization of h-A into
the coronal region. Since the packing frustration is released by h-A for both BCC
and FCC lattice, BCC symmetry would be favored in that A blocks and h-A chains in
the corresponding micelle corona undergo less stretching.
The relief of packing frustration by h-A becomes ineffective at elevated
temperature where most h-A chains are solubilized into the micelle corona. In this
case, a fraction of A block chains and h-A chains in the coronal regions must be more
stretched to fill the space near the vertices of the W-S cell; such that the micelles
prefer FCC packing owing to weaker packing frustration. In light of this model, the
observation that the TOOT of the present blend is about 80 oC higher than the
previously studied system with slightly shorter PEO block implies that increasing
PEO block length tends to exert a stronger repulsive force against the solubilization of
h-PB into the micelle corona.
(b) The Formation of t-FCC Phase
It is known that block copolymer mesophase in the as-cast state may be
nonequilibrium because the solution mesophase of the A-b-B/solvent mixture above
the threshold polymer concentration for microphase separation may deviate from the
equilibrium melt structure of A-b-B and such a structure may be trapped into the bulk
upon solvent removal, yielding metastable melt structure in the as-cast sample.39-41
Although toluene has a slightly closer solubility parameter toward PB,42 it can still
be considered as a nearly neutral solvent for PEO and PB because toluene can be
dissolved nearly equally well into PEO and PB domains. During the solvent
evaporation, the increase of the block copolymer concentration tends to increase the
effective segregation strength between PEO and PB in the medium of a neutral
solvent of toluene, in that the effective interaction parameter, eff, can be formulated
as P withP being the polymer concentration according to the dilution
approximation.3,43 Consequently, we expect a series of transitions such as follows to
occur with increasing concentration: homogeneous solution  disordered micelles 
34
A-b-B/h-A blends, the density dips may be eliminated by segregating homopolymer
chains into the vacancies, but this causes a loss in entropy of mixing. As a
consequence, an interfacial free energy with entropic origin exists at the BCC/FCC
grain boundary and this excess free energy is responsible for the nucleation barrier of
the OOT.
The nucleation barrier can be formulated following the classical nucleation
theory of crystallization. Let us consider a BCC grain with spherical shape formed
out of the FCC matrix phase (e.g. on cooling); the corresponding free energy of
formation is given by
where gB and gF is the bulk free energy per unit volume of BCC and FCC phase,
respectively, RG is the radius of the BCC grain, andis the interfacial free energy.
The activation barrier (G*) and the critical size of the BCC grain (RG*) are obtained
from the condition
Therefore,G*and RG* are given by
Without the precursor, the nucleation of the BCC grain might rely on the probability
that the FCC-packed spherical micelles reorganize collectively into a BCC grain with
the size reaching R ≥RG* instantaneously though thermal fluctuations. Considering
the nanoscale nature of the micelles, such a probability is expected to be low unless
RG* is small. This may be why BCC phase was unable to develop from the
BCC-free as-cast blend upon heating (cf. Figure 2(a)). The same argument applies
to the failure of developing the FCC phase in the reheating experiment in which the
initial state was FCC free (cf. Figure 5)
According to Eq. (2) and (3), RG* and G* decrease with increasing difference

boundary between t-FCC and FCC phases is marked at 170 oC by the
vertical dashed line, which is determined by the slop change in Im-1 in the
heating cycle. In the cooling cycle, Im-1 and D are closely agreed with those
in the heating cycle when temperature elevates above 170 oC. Little
hysterysis stemming from the metastable nature of the trapped FCC phase is
found below 170 oC. The parenthesis in the symbol denotes the thermal
treatment where H represents the Im-1 collected in the heating cycle and C
represents that collected in the cooling cycle. The temperature dependence
of D is similar to that in Im-1.
Figure 7 Im-1 vs T-1 plots for the annealed PEO-b-PB/h-PB blend. The boundary
between BCC and FCC phases is marked at 200 oC by the vertical dashed
line, in that this temperature roughly represents the point where FCC
phase vanishes in the cooling cycle. Little hysterysis effect is found across
the BCC-FCC OOT at high temperature (i.e., in the temperature region from
170 to 260 oC), while strong hysterysis stemming from the metastable
nature of the trapped FCC phase is found below 170 oC. Through
comparing Im-1s in cooling and reheating cycles, another strong hysterysis is
found to appear with reheating the cooled blend. The hysterysis is
originating from the coexistence of BCC and FCC phase in the onset of
cooling. The parenthesis in the symbol denotes the thermal treatment
where H represents the Im-1 collected in the heating cycle, C represents that
collected in the cooling cycle and RH represents that collected in the

III. Existence of FCC-Packed Spherical Micelles in Diblock
Copolymer Melt
Abstract
We present the experimental observation of an anomalous face-centered cubic
(FCC) packing of the spherical micelles formed by neat diblock copolymer in the
quiescent melt. This closely packed lattice coexisted with a disordered micelle phase
in a very narrow temperature region. The unimers and the micelles with small
association numbers present in the matrix phase were the keys for stabilizing the FCC
packing.
Crystallization is a self-ordering process that prevails among various systems
ranging from microscopic objects such as atoms and molecules to mesoscopic
colloidal particles. Above certain threshold concentrations colloidal particles with
uniform size can crystallize into different lattice structures governed by their
geometric shape and interaction potential.1 Body-centered cubic (BCC) and closely
packed lattices [either face-centered cubic (FCC) or hexagonally close-packed (HCP)]
are the common structures formed by spherical colloids. Steep interaction potentials
normally favor the close packing whereas BCC is the more stable symmetry under
softer interactions.2,3
Micelles formed by block copolymers in the melt and the solution are soft
colloids which also exhibit the propensity to crystallize under appropriate conditions.
In contrast to hard spherical colloids, the spherical micelles formed by neat diblock
copolymers in the quiescent melt have never been found to organize in closely packed
lattices apart from BCC packing. However, self-consistent mean-field (SCMF)
calculations have predicted a closely-packed sphere (CPS) phase situating in a very
narrow temperature window between BCC phase and a disordered homogeneous
phase.4,5 The reason why such a CPS phase was difficult to access experimentally
may be due to the strong thermal fluctuations that disrupt the long-range order of CPS
phase into a disordered micelle phase at elevated temperatures.6,7 The absence of
CPS phase has also been attributed its instability relative to the disordered micelle
phase in a recent theoretical study, where the disordered state was considered to
46
The BCC phase transformed into a disordered phase when the temperature was
raised to 203 oC, where the corresponding scattering profile showed a broad halo
centering at 0.42 nm-1 along with a shoulder near 0.7 nm-1. The observed scattering
feature was consistent with a disordered micelle (DM) phase6,7 in which the spherical
micelles with liquid-like disorder interacted through the hard-sphere potential. The
solid curve in the scattering profile at 203 oC represents the fit by the Percus-Yevick
hard-sphere model assuming liquid-like packing of polydisperse spherical
domains.11,12. The hard-sphere radius, RHS, considered here covered an impenetrable
shell relevant to the corona surrounding the spherical domain (RHS > radius of PEO
sphere, Rc).12 The parameters obtained from the fit were: the volume fraction of
PEO domain fc = 0.081, mean value of Rc = 4.52 nm and RHS = 7.86 nm. The
significantly smaller fc in the DM phase than fPEO (= 0.18) indicated that the matrix
phase in which the PEO domains were dispersed contained the unconstrained diblocks
(i.e., the unimers)5 and the oligomeric micelles (dimmers, trimers, etc.) which could
not be resolved by SAXS.
Figure 2 shows the temperature-dependent SAXS profiles collected by cooling
the copolymer from the DM phase. Three diffraction peaks situating at 0.37, 0.62 and
0.76 nm-1 emerged when the system was cooled to 201 oC. The positions of the
higher-order peaks relative to that of the primary peak deviated from those (marked
by the vertical dashed lines) prescribed by BCC lattice. Indeed, the peak positions
closely followed the ratio of 1: (8/3)1/2: (12/3)1/2, which were assignable to (111), (220)
and (222) diffraction plane of FCC lattice, respectively.9 The FCC phase coexisted
with the DM phase as the broad peak at 0.42 nm-1 still persisted and masked the FCC
(200) peak locating at (4/3)1/2 times the position of the primary peak. The amount of
FCC phase did not increase on further cooling, since decreasing the temperature to
200 oC did not essentially alter the scattering profile. As a matter of fact, the scattering
pattern remained virtually unaffected by prolonged annealing at 200 oC, elucidating
that FCC was a stable structure coexisting with the DM phase.
When the system was further cooled to 197 oC the FCC peaks diminished and the
originally broad peak at 0.42 nm-1 became sharp and intensified. A diffraction peak
situating at ca. 21/2 times the position of the 0.42 nm-1 peak was also visible, showing
48
which corresponds well to the experimentally observed image.
Now it is worthwhile to consider why FCC would be the favored structure at
elevated temperature. The free energy of block copolymer micelles in the melt state
mainly consists of two parts, namely, the interfacial free energy and the chain
conformational free energy. For the micelles packed in an ordered lattice, stretching
of the coronal blocks tethered at the domains is not uniform because a portion of them
have to stretch more to fit into the vertices of the Wigner-Seitz (W-S) cells to produce
a constant-mean-curvature (CMC) surface under the constraint of melt
incompressibility.5 Such a packing frustration increases the conformational free
energy and is stronger in BCC lattice than in FCC lattice, because the corresponding
W-S cell in the former is a truncated octahedron while that in the later is a rhombic
dodecahedron. Therefore, FCC packing is favored in terms of relief of packing
frustration. On the other hand, it can be shown that under given volume fraction of
spherical domain, the surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) of the domains packed in FCC
lattice is 1.03 times that associated with the BCC lattice, i.e. (S/V)FCC ≈
25/6(S/V)BCC/31/2 = 1.03(S/V)BCC, assuming that the interplanar spacing of (110) plane
in BCC lattice is equal to that of (111) plane in FCC. At low temperatures where the
interblock repulsion is strong, BCC packing is favored as the reduction of interfacial
free energy dominates the micelle ordering. Increasing temperature alleviates the
effect of interfacial tension; therefore, the spheres split into smaller size and organize
into FCC lattice once the release of packing frustration outweighs the interfacial free
energy contribution.
Although the above argument appears to rationalize the stability of BCC and
FCC phase at low and high temperature, respectively, it is subjected to the speculation
that the free energy difference between these two lattices is too small to drive the
observed BCC-FCC transition, since the nonequilibrium effect such as finite grain
size and lattice distortion coupled with thermal fluctuations may easily overwhelm the
equilibrium factors discussed above. We hence postulated that the unimers and
oligomeric micelles present in the matrix phase, which was not considered above,
facilitated the stability of FCC lattice at elevated temperatures. These species played
a similar role to the homopolymer in the blend showing a broader FCC window.
Nevertheless, further studies for resolving their dispersion state in the matrix phase is

Figure 2 A series of SAXS profiles collected in the cooling cycle. Three FCC peaks
with the relative positions 1: (8/3)1/2: (12/3)1/2 emerge at 201 oC. The
vertical dashed lines on the profile at 201 oC mark the positions of the
higher-order peaks that would have been exhibited by the BCC lattice.
