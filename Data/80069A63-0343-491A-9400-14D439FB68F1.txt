Abstract 
This project consists of two parts. First, 
the volatility of Taiwan Weight Index is 
time-vary nonlinear and asymmetric. 
Generally, there are many and complex 
reasons that can affect transmissions of 
volatility such as good news and bad news, etc. 
we derive a new class of flexible 
Intelligent-Switch Gaussian Mixture GARCH 
model. We use this tool for analysis and 
modeling of the properties that are apparent in 
financial time series. In general, the 
transmission of volatility in the stock market 
is time-varying, nonlinear, and asymmetric 
with respect to both positive and negative 
results. Given this fact, we adopt the method 
of fuzzy logic systems to modify the threshold 
values for an asymmetric mixture Gaussian 
GARCH model. From the simulation results, 
we have determined that the forecasting of 
volatility performance is significantly 
improved if the leverage effect of clustering is 
considered along with the use of expert 
knowledge enabled by the mixture Gaussian 
GARCH model. Finally, use the free software 
to build systems, and the three-tier system is 
adopted MVC architecture were built the 
system in Fig. 1 and forecasting system in Fig.

the variance process. Bai et al. [4] proposed a 
model known as the mixture Gaussian 
GARCH model. This model distribution 
postulates that a normal density generates a 
large number of innovations with a small 
variance, while a normal density generates a 
small number of innovations with a large 
variance. This paper aims to fill this gap by 
considering the threshold values as 
time-varying nonlinear functions rather than 
as constants, as has been previously assumed. 
Consequently, we use fuzzy logic systems to 
select suitable threshold values to deal with 
positive or negative information in what we 
propose to call the Intelligent-Switch GARCH 
model [13]. The proposed method makes use 
of time-varying threshold values to 
discriminate between several regimes. Daily 
return values that fall below the threshold are 
denoted as negative information; daily return 
values that exceed the threshold are denoted 
as positive information. 
Fuzzy systems have recently found 
extensive applications in a wide variety of 
industrial systems and consumer products; 
moreover, they have attracted the attention of 
many control researchers due to their 
model-free approach [1,3,22,24-26,28-29,35]. 
Fuzzy control algorithms attempt to make use 
of information from human experts. The 
expert information is generally represented by 
fuzzy terms, e.g., small, large, not very large, 
etc.; this representation may be used for 
convenience due to a lack of more precise 
knowledge or difficulty with communication 
among other reasons. However, most of the 
fuzzy control algorithms proposed lack 
analytical tools for specifying the general 
design procedures that would guarantee basic 
performance criteria. Generally, such fuzzy 
control algorithms combine expert knowledge 
with conventional engineering systems in an 
ad hoc manner, thereby necessitating 
simulations performed to demonstrate the 
validity of these approaches in the context of 
specific control problems [14,17-19,30,34]. 
In this study, we modify the threshold 
values for a positive / negative information 
distinction with a fuzzy rule base on the 
context of the mixture Gaussian GARCH 
model. Our simulations use stock market data 
from the Taiwan weighted index from January 
1, 2004 through March 31, 2006.

 The mixture Gaussian GARCH(p,q) 
model involves the joint estimation of a 
conditional mean and conditional variance 
equation. The empirical and theoretical appeal 
of this model is due to the fact that it is simple 
yet still manages to capture the persistence of 
volatility [7]. However, the model imposes a 
symmetrical influence of lagged residuals on 
current volatility, thereby failing to 
accommodate sign asymmetries: negative 
shocks to returns give rise to larger volatility 
than equivalent positive shocks to returns. 
Ignoring this fact can lead to poor prognostic 
characteristics. Consequently, in order to 
consider the differential effects of the 
propagation of volatility from positive or 
negative information, we adopt fuzzy systems 
to propose a Fuzzy Asymmetric GARCH 
model. The Fuzzy Asymmetric GARCH

greater than 20% improvement in the 
forecasting of the performance of the MSFE 
over the other models. 
4. Conclusions  
Information is asymmetric in financial 
markets. In general, there are many complex 
factors that influence the propagation of 
volatility. The empirical evidence exhibits 
characteristics of nonlinearity and 
time-variance. For these reasons, this paper 
considers the Fuzzy Asymmetric mixture 
Gaussian GARCH model. We investigate the 
propagation of volatility of the stock markets 
between the NASDAQ index and various 
local market indices. 
The empirical results coming from the 
Fuzzy Asymmetric mixture Gaussian 
GARCH model indicate that the propagation 
of volatility between the stock markets of the 
NASDAQ index and the local market indices 
are nonlinear, time-varying, and asymmetric. 
We also show that the Fuzzy Asymmetric 
mixture Gaussian GARCH model performs 
much better than the GARCH model. 
However, many theories and models can 
be utilized for financial market research. This 
paper considers only fuzzy set theory and 
time-variance and is therefore very limited. In 
the future, we intend to improve the model by 
adding other impact factors, such as the 
trading volume and financial reports, to the 
Fuzzy Asymmetric mixture Gaussian 
GARCH model.
