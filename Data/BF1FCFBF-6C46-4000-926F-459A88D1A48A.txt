ABSTRACT 
The amount of pollutants produced 
during manufacturing processes of 
TFT-LCD (Thin-film transistor liquid 
crystal display) substantially increases 
due to an increasing production of the 
opto-electronic industry in Taiwan. The 
total amount of wastewater from 
TFT-LCD manufacturing plants is 
expected to exceed 200,000 CMD in the 
near future. Typically, organic solvents 
used in TFT-LCD manufacturing 
processes account for more than 33% of 
the total TFT-LCD wastewater. The 
main components of these organic 
solvents are composed of the stripper 
(dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 
monoethanolamine (MEA)), developer 
(tetra-methyl ammonium hydroxide 
(TMAH)) and chelating agents. These 
compounds are recognized as non- or 
slow-biodegradable organic compounds 
and little information is available 
regarding their biological treatability.  
In this study, we review and survey 
the current status of biological removal 
of C, N, and S-containing pollutants 
from TFT-LCD wastewaters at bench, 
pilot, and full-scale levels.  By doing so, 
we acquire the following information: 1. 
In general, TFT-LCD organic 
wastewaters contain COD, TKN, and 
total phosphorus with concentrations of 
800-1500 mg/L, 65-200 mg-N/L, and 
83-150 mg-P/L, respectively.  2. MEA 
can be treated without difficulties under 
aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic 
conditions, and ammonia is released as a 
product from MEA degradation.  3. A 
higher DMSO degradation rate can be 
achieved under anaerobic condition with 
the presence of external electron donors.  
But malodorous compound such as 
DMS will be produced under this 
condition.  Same end product is 
detected under anoxic condition.  
Under aerobic condition, the end 
product of DMSO degradation is sulfate.  
4. Through methanogenisis, TMAH can 
be degraded without difficulties and 
ammonia and methane are the end 
products of this reaction.  TMAH can 
also be degraded under aerobic 
condition and ammonia is released as a 
product from TMAH degradation.  5. 
MEA and TMAH at concentrations 
higher than 250 and 50 mg/L, 
respectively, present inhibitory effects 
on nitrification activity, while DMSO is 
not at concentrations up to 100 mg/L.  
6. Special groups of microorganisms 
responsible for carbon (TMAH and 
DMSO) and nitrogen (nitrification) 
removal can be slow-growers and 
require a longer time to oxidize those 
compounds.  Compared to 
 4 
same molecule. As a result, it undergoes 
a wide variety of reactions common to 
amine and alcohol.  The first step of 
MEA biodegradation is hydration to 
ammonia and acetaldehyde.  Under 
aerobic conditions, ammonia can further 
be oxidized to nitrite and nitrate through 
nitrification, while acetaldehyde is 
converted to ethanol and acetate and 
further oxidized to carbon dioxide 
(Ndegwa et al., 2004).  MEA can act as 
carbon and nitrogen source at the same 
time, therefore, no extra nitrogen source 
is needed during biodegradation.  
TMAH is used as the major component 
of positive photoresist developers in the 
photolithography process of LCD 
manufacturing. The degradation of 
waste fluid containing TMAH is usually 
difficult in activated sludge treatment. 
(Urakami et al., 1990) The proposed 
intermediate substances in TMAH 
degradation is trimethylamine, 
dimethylamine, methylamine, and 
formaldehyde (Anthony, 1982). But 
these intermediate compounds were not 
detected during the biodegradation of 
TMAH, only ammonium ion was found 
(Urakami et al., 1990). 
Anoxic-oxic process is usually 
recommended for TFT-LCD wastewater 
treatment (Koito et al., 1998; Chen et al., 
2003).  Detailed information such as 
mechanisms and kinetics about the 
biodegradation of DMSO, MEA, and 
TMAH, however, is limited.  In this 
study, we review and survey the current 
status of biological removal of C, N, P, 
and S-containing pollutants from 
TFT-LCD wastewaters at bench, pilot, 
and full-scale levels.  Based on the 
information acquired, we propose an 
integrated-thinking process as potential 
solution for biological removal of C, N, 
P, S-containing pollutants from 
TFT-LCD wastewaters. 
 
2 CHARACTERISTICS OF 
TFT-LCD WASTEWATER 
TFT-LCD is one of the most popular 
displays all over the world. It can be 
used in computer, television, or even cell 
phone. Taiwan is one of the largest 
TFT-LCD producing countries in the 
world. The amount of pollutants 
produced during manufacturing 
processes of TFT-LCD substantially 
increases due to an increasing 
production of the opto-electronic 
industry. The total amount of wastewater 
from TFT-LCD manufacturing plants is 
expected to exceed 200,000 CMD in the 
near future. Therefore, finding an 
effective and economical way to treat 
this wastewater is an essential work for 
Taiwanese TFT-LCD industry. A large 
amount of different chemicals are used 
in TFT-LCD manufacturing processes. 
According to their characteristics, 
TFT-LCD wastewater can be 
categorized into different types of 
wastewaters as shown in Table 1 (Lin, 
2006).  
 
2.1 Characteristics of TFT-LCD 
organic wastewaters 
Chen et al. (2003) conducted 
long-term monitoring on the quality of 
the TFT-LCD manufacturing organic 
wastewater, and the results are

Huang (2006) showed that 
traditional indicators such as COD were 
not representative for measurements of 
TFT-LCD wastewaters because of the 
low recovery for DMSO and TMAH.  
Almost no COD recovery was detected 
for TMAH at any concentrations 
examined.  For DMSO, the COD 
recovery was only about 10%.  Park et 
al. (2001) also showed that the TOC 
recovery of DMSO was only 60% and 
12 % for COD.  Therefore, in this study, 
in addition to COD, measurements of 
TMAH, DMSO, and MEA were 
conducted in order to provide a better 
evaluation on their biodegradation.  
 
3. A FEW THINGS WE LEARN 
FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES ON 
BIOLOGICAL TFT-LCD 
WASTEWATER TREATMENT 
 
3.1 Biological Processes for TFT-LCD 
Wastewater Treatment 
There are a few studies about the 
biological treatment processes for mixed 
TFT-LCD organic wastewaters.  Some 
of them studied treatment performance 
using laboratory-scale bioreactors and 
some of them evaluated full-scale ones.  
The followings summarized reported 
information regarding biological 
treatment processes that have been 
applied for mixed TFT-LCD organic 
wastewaters.   
 
3.1.1 Laboratory-Scale Bioreactors 
Conventional Activated Sludge 
Bioreactors using A/O Process 
Chen et al. (2003) used a lab-scale 
anoxic-oxic process (Figure 1) to treat 
TFT-LCD organic wastewater with COD 
and TKN concentrations ranging from 
1000-2000 mg/L and 100-250 mg-N/L, 
respectively.  By varying influent 
flowrate Q (changing HRT of 
bioreactors as well) and mixed liquor 
recycled flowrate (nitrate recycle flow), 
92–98% of COD removal efficiency and 
70% of TN removal efficiency can be 
attained under operational conditions at 
HRT >1.7 d and mixed liquor recycled 
rate <4Q.  This indicates that a 
conventional activated sludge system

wastewater without any adverse impacts.  
The removal efficiency of DMSO, MEA, 
and TMAH was as high as 99%, at the 
concentration of 766, 1,701 and 235 
mg/L respectively.  For the aerobic 
SBR, the overall performance was 
similar to that for the A/O SBR with 
more than 99% removal efficiency for 
DMSO, MEA, and TMAH.

3.1.2 Full-Scale Bioreactors 
A/O/A/O Barnard Process 
Tseng et al. (2007) investigated 
microbial community structure of 
activated sludge taken from a full-scale 
TFT-LCD wastewater treatment plant.  
The full-scale WWTP applied the 
Barnard process (A/O/A/O) as shown in 
the Figure 3 for treating TFT-LCD 
organic wastewater generated in the 
manufacturing processes.  Influent 
COD and ammonia concentrations were 
reported to be 300 mg/L and 84 mg-N/L, 
respectively.  After treatment, the 
effluent COD and TKN concentrations 
were less than 40 mg/L and 15 mg-N/L, 
respectively.  According to the authors, 
the A/OA/O process is capable of 
removing carbon and nitrogen at the 
same time.  Its performance for total 
nitrogen removal, however, is difficulty 
to evaluate since information regarding 
influent TKN and effluent nitrate is not 
available.  Furthermore, information 
regarding DMSO, MEA, and TMAH in 
this study is not available either and 
their removal cannot be evaluated 
properly.

Conventional Activated Sludge 
Bioreactors 
 In the early years of TFT-LCD 
industry starting to grow in Taiwan, 
conventional activated sludge 
bioreactors were used to treat TFT-LCD 
wastewater and some of them are still in 
use.  One full-scale TFT-LCD 
wastewater treatment plant investigated 
in this study applied the conventional 
activated sludge bioreactor as shown in 
the Figure 4 for treating organic 
wastewater generated in the TFT-LCD 
manufacturing processes.  Influent 
COD and TKN concentrations were 
averaged at 550 mg/L and 114 mg-N/L, 
respectively.  After treatment, the 
effluent COD, TKN, and nitrate 
concentrations were measured to be 190 
mg/L, 17 and 30 mg-N/L, respectively.  
The conventional activated sludge 
bioreactor was able to perform carbon 
and ammonia oxidation, but may be 
insufficient in order to meet regulatory 
effluent criteria.  In addition to COD 
and nitrogen species, measurements of 
 12 
while effluent COD, TKN, and ammonia 
concentrations of secondary clarifier 
were measured to be 300 mg/L, 130 and 
120 mg-N/L, respectively.  According 
to TMAH measurements, the UASB 
bioreactor was able to decompose 
TMAH successfully and ammonia 
release was observed in the UASB 
effluent due to TMAH decomposition, 
suggesting that methanogenic condition 
may be an option for biological 
treatment of high TMAH-containing 
wastewaters.  The following 
conventional activated sludge bioreactor 
was designed to perform carbon and 
ammonia oxidation, but results showed 
that it may not satisfy regulatory effluent 
criteria, presumably due to its short HRT 
and low biomass concentration leading 
to an insufficient oxidation.

3.2 Degradation kinetics of DMSO, 
MEA, and TMAH under anaerobic, 
anoxic, aerobic, and methanogenic 
conditions  
In Lei et al. (2007), batch tests were 
conducted in order to evaluate 
degradation kinetics of DMSO, MEA 
and TMAH under aerobic, anoxic and 
anaerobic conditions.  Batch 
experiments were prepared with 1L 
flasks containing 400 mg/L of DMSO, 
250 mg/L of MEA and 120 mg/L of 
 14 
In addition to the three conditions 
examined above, in this study, we 
conducted anaerobic batch tests to 
evaluate TMAH degradation kinetics 
under methanogenic conditions using 
sludge taken from a full-scale UASB 
treating TFT-LCD wastewater.  The 
UASB sludge was able to degrade 2000 
mg/L of TMAH within 10 hours and 
attained a specific degradation rate of 
18.6 mg TMAH/g VSS-hr.  Although 
the specific degradation rate obtained for 
methanogenic conditions was similar to 
that for aerobic conditions, the UASB 
sludge and methanogenic conditions 
would be favored over the aerobic ones 
for TMAH treatment due to its superb 
ability of handling high strength of 
TMAH-containing wastewaters.  
Furthermore, Chang et al. (2008) 
operated UASB fed with 
TMAH-containing wastewater to enrich 
anaerobic TMAH-degrading sludge 
under methanogenic conditions.  Their 
results showed that the UASB was able 
to perform more than 95% of TMAH 
removal efficiency at volumetric 
loadings around 7.30 kg TMAH/m/d.  
Toxicity effects of TMAH on enriched 
UASB sludge was also investigated 
using anaerobic toxicity assay tests, and 
the result showed that TMAH 
concentrations up to 10,000 mg/L did 
not present adverse effects on the 
examined anaerobic archaea.  
Therefore, they suggest that anaerobic 
treatment technique such as UASB may 
possess competitive advantages for 
TMAH-containing wastewater treatment 
from the TFT-LCD manufacturing 
industry. 
 
3.3 Effect of MEA, TMAH, and 
DMSO on Nitrification Activity  
During biodegradation of TMAH 
and MEA, ammonia can be released 
(Anthony, 1982; Zehnder, 1988; 
Ndegwa et al., 2004), leading to an 
increased ammonia concentration and a 
requirement of nitrification for nitrogen 
removal.  Whang et al. (2007) 
conducted several sets of batch 
experiments to evaluate effects of MEA, 
TMAH, and DMSO on nitrification.  
First set of batch experiments was fed 
with MEA as the major nitrogen source 
at concentrations of 50, 100, and 100 
mg/L (M50, M100, M150).  Second set 
was conducted with both MEA (50, 150, 
250, and 400 mg/L) and ammonia (50 
(NL) and 150 (NH) mg-N/L) as nitrogen 
sources.  In both sets of experiments, 
activated sludge examined was taken 
from a lab-scale aerobic MBR 
acclimated with TFT-LCD wastewater.  
The results are summarized in the 
format of specific rates as shown in 
Table 7.  With respect to the specific 
MEA degradation rate, the rates 
increased as MEA concentration 
increased up to 250 mg/L, but a slight 
decrease was observed at an MEA 
concentration of 400 mg/L.  At MEA 
concentrations lower than 150 mg/L, 
nitrification, in terms of specific nitrate 
production rate (S. NPR), was enhanced 
as MEA concentration increased, while 
at MEA concentrations higher than 250 
mg/L, nitrification was completely 
 16 
 
3.4 Mathematical Model Simulation 
for Biological Nutrient Removal from 
TFT-LCD Wastewaters 
A preliminary study on 
mathematical model simulation was 
performed in this study using the 
BioWin® software (Envirosim Inc., 
Ontario, Canada) in order to evaluate 
application potential of biological 
nutrient removal for TFT-LCD 
wastewater treatment.  The model 
applied the UCT process for both 
biological nitrogen and phosphorus 
removal and adopted mathematical 
expressions and parameter values 
suggested in activated sludge models 
(Henze et al., 2000).  Without further 
calibrating the model at this moment, 
this preliminary simulation trial was just 
used to estimate an overall mass balance 
on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus 
removal from TFT-LCD wastewater.  
Based on the survey of TFT-LCD 
wastewater characteristics presented in 
this study, the influent wastewater with 
COD, TKN, and phosphorus 
concentrations of 1000 mg/L, 100 
mg-N/L, and 100 mg-P/L, respectively 
were used for simulation.  The model 
predicted that, at steady state, the 
effluent COD, TN, and phosphorus 
concentrations were 64 mg/L, 30 
mg-N/L, and 77 mg-P/L, respectively, 
after UCT process treatment.  The 
simulation results suggest that with 
current conditions biological nutrient 
removal is insufficient for TFT-LCD 
wastewater treatment in order to meet 
effluent criteria especially for 
phosphorus.  Further evaluation of 
additional organic supplements for 
denitrification and biological 
phosphorus removal and/or combination 
of biological and chemical processes for 
nutrient removal from TFT-LCD 
wastewaters is required in order to 
satisfy effluent discharge permits.    
 
4. SUMMARY 
 
Based on the results and 
discussion presented above, pros and 
cons regarding biological processes for 
C, N, S removal from TFT-LCD 
wastewater can be summarized as 
followings: 
1. MEA can be treated without 
difficulties under aerobic, anoxic, 
and anaerobic conditions.  
Ammonia is released as a product 
from MEA degradation. 
2. A higher DMSO degradation rate 
can be achieved under anaerobic 
condition with the presence of 
external electron donors.  But 
malodorous compound such as DMS 
will be produced under this 
condition.  Same end product is 
detected under anoxic condition.  
Under aerobic condition, the end 
product of DMSO degradation is 
sulfate.   
3. Through methanogenisis, TMAH, as 
high as 2000 mg/L, can be degraded 
within 10 hours without difficulties.  
Ammonia and methane are the end 
products of this reaction.  TMAH 
can also be degraded under aerobic 
condition and ammonia is released
