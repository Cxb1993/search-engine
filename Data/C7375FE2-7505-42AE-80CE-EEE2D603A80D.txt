摘要 
本計畫中，首先我們利用預鍍薄氧化矽(SiO2)層在可撓式基板上，有效保護塑膠基
板，提高其可承受之溫度，而透過提高氧化銦錫(Indium Tin Oxide, ITO)的鍍製溫度，我
們獲得平整度與導電度較佳之導電薄膜，再透過染料濃度的控制，我們製備出效率達
6.5 lm/W 之可撓式純白光 OLED 元件；此外，我們亦製備ㄧ系列新穎奈米點強化高效
率藍光、綠光、紅光和白光有機電致發光元件，在非發光層中，添加表面帶電荷的新穎
奈米點，其中，藍光元件添加氨根奈米點，在 100 cd/m2，效率從 18.0 lm/W 提升至 35.8 
lm/W 的世界紀錄；而在照明需求的高亮度 1,000 cd/m2，效率也從 12.4 lm/W 提升至 21.2 
lm/W，增加幅度高達 71%，添加帶電荷的奈米點，能有效地調致電洞經由侷限或淬熄
機制的傳遞，避免過多的電洞進入發光層，造成載子不平衡；另外，帶電荷的奈米點可
形成排斥電場，使得只有較高能量的電洞才可通過侷限，逐漸進入發光層，增加載子的
再結合區域，達到高效率和高亮度的表現。 
 
研究目的 
本計畫將結合奈米點的引入，以研發更前瞻、創新的奈米點強化可撓式有機發光二
極體；所擬研究重點，在於如何製造更高效率、更長壽命的可撓式各色光 OLED；所
擬探討的項目有：高效率可撓式元件結構、奈米點材料之製備與改質、奈米點強化OLED
元件、奈米點改質封裝膠材之探討、封裝膠材對可撓式元件壽命之影響等。 
 
文獻探討 
近來發現，將奈米點單獨置入元件各層之間，或使用適當比例的奈米材料摻混於有
機材料中，均可有效增進元件發光效能；如：Carter等人於1997年的研究[1] ， 將粒徑
30~50nm 之 SiO2 及TiO2 氧化物奈米微粒，  摻混於橘紅光 poly(2-methoxy-5-2' 
-ethylhexyl-oxy)-1,4- phenylene-vinylene (MEH-PPV) 高分子材料中，提高元件注入電流
密度與亮度約一次方，於5 V時，發光亮度10,000 cd/m2及外部量子效率1 %；Valery 
Bliznyuk等人[2]，將奈米點塗佈於ITO基板上，使元件發光效能提升。 
  III
免用電洞傳輸層，或採用複合電子傳輸層等等，預計可更進一步提升白光元件之效率，
亦可簡化元件製程、提升良率，有利量產之實現。 
C. 奈米點之合成及其對有機發光元件效能之影響 
據文獻記載，無機量子點的導入，的確多數並未能有效提升效率；或有提升，也常
常是很有限。但我們曾發現，將奈米點導入可旋塗的發光層中，可以提升效率15%，由
於不斷的嘗試，我們進一步發現，將恰當的奈米點導入在恰當的元件層狀結構中，可以
提升效率230%，讓可溶液製程的白光OLED，效率進展到10.3lm/W，是新的世界紀錄。 
奈米點強化效率的方式，一般乃由載子注入平衡或增加載子注入達成，據此，我們
將選用適當的奈米點材料，或改質奈米點之電性，並將奈米點加入元件中適當的位置，
以期載子的注入平衡最佳化，或有最大化載子的注入，進而獲得效率的大幅提昇；我們
將製備各式奈米點，如：高溫聚合形成之CdSe、CdTe 或ZnS 等，溶膠-凝膠法合成之
SiO2 與TiO2 等，尤其，將製備電性改質之polysilicic acid 奈米點，並將上述奈米點摻
入有機發光元件中，以期增進載子注入平衡與覆合效率，進而提升元件發光效能。 
結果與討論 
本計畫首先利用在可撓式基板上薄氧化矽(SiO2)層的預鍍，有效提高氧化銦錫
(Indium Tin Oxide, ITO)的鍍製溫度，獲得平整度與導電度較佳之導電薄膜，再透過染料
濃度的控制，我們製備出高效率可撓式純白光 OLED 元件，成果發表在 Journal of 
Materials Chemistry (Impact Factor = 4.8)上。 
此外，本計劃製備ㄧ系列新穎奈米點強化之有機發光二極體，主要為奈米點之製
備、改質與應用，探討改質前後與不同改質奈米點對元件效能之影響，透過奈米點與改
質奈米點的使用，本研究團隊研發出多個高效率有機發光二極體，效率並達世界水準。 
透過奈米點摻雜濃度的最佳化與摻雜位置的調整，我們製備出高效率螢光型白光有
機發光二極體，能量效率高達17.1 lm/W，為目前之世界記錄，成果發表於Advanced 
Functional Materials上(Impact Factor : 6.8)；而以濕式製程製作之磷光型白光有機發光二
極體效率達23.7 lm/W，成果發表於Organic Electronics上(Impact Factor : 3.6)。

efficiency of 6.5 lm/W at 800 cd/m2 and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 
3.2%, obtained using blue host 1-butyl-9,10-naphthalene-anthracene (BANE) doped 
with 0.05wt% red dye 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(julolidin-4-yl-vinyl)-4H- 
pyran (DCM2) in a single emissive layer sandwiched between an electron-blocking 
effective hole-transporting-layer of N,N’-bis-(1-naphthy)-N,N’diphenyl-1,1’ 
-biphenyl-4-4’-di-amine (NPB) and a hole-blocking effective electron- 
transporting-layer of 1,3,5-tris(N-phenyl-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi). 
Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 shows the schematic illustration of the device structure and a 
photograph of the BANE host composing flexible pure-white device at emission. The 
device comprises 175 µm PES/50-500Å SiO2 /500Å ITO/450Å NPB/300Å white 
emissive layer/400Å TPBi/10Å lithium fluoride/1500Å aluminum. The white 
emissive layer was obtained by vapor deposition of a solution-premixed compound of 
the blue light-emitting host with the red dye. The experimental details are presented in 
the literature.[10] 
 
Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the structure of the flexible white OLED. The 
inset shows the photograph of the resultant device at emission under bending. 
Figure 2 shows the electro-luminescent (EL) spectra of the white OLEDs with 
the use of blue host BANE, doped with red dye DCM2, on PES and glass substrates. 
By doping 0.05 wt% DCM2 into a blue BANE host on glass yields a device with pure 
white emission with Commission International de L’Eclairage (CIE) coordinates 
(0.314, 0.317) with a power efficiency of 5.5 lm/W at 52 cd/m2. Surprisingly, 
  4
 
 
Interestingly, the emission changes markedly from pure-white to bluish-white for 
ITO sputtered at 200 oC or above. Such blue-shift enables more red dye DCM2 to be 
added, to keep the emission pure-white. Adding 0.05 wt% DCM2 in the blue BANE 
composing device on PES yields pure-white emission of (0.321, 0.339) with a high 
power efficiency of 6.5 lm/W with 800 cd/m2 at 8.5 V. Its maximum brightness was 
12,000 cd/m2 with 670 A/m2 at 11.5 V, as presented in Table 1. The device exhibits 
excellent colour stability, i.e. that its CIE coordinates change only from (0.320, 0.331) 
to (0.314, 0.327) for brightness changing from 100 to 1,000 cd/m2 . 
Table I. ITO sputtering temperature effects on the electroluminescent 
characteristics of the flexible white OLEDs with the blue host BANE doped with 0.03 
wt% red dye DCM2 on PES substrate. 
 
Figure 3 shows the  effect of the sputtering temperature of ITO on the surface 
resistivity  and carrier concentration of the ITO films on PES. Both the resistivity 
and carrier concentration were directly measured using Vander Pauw techniques  at 
room temperature by using a Hall-effect measurement system (Accent HL 5500 PC). 
Prior to the measurements, each ITO sample was ultrasonically cleaned with methanol 
and blown dry with high-purity nitrogen gas, and ohmic-contact between the ITO 
sample surface and the four metallic probes was secured to minimize 
  6
 
Figure 4. SiO2 thickness effects on the surface roughness and resistivity of the 
ITO films sputter on SiO2 pre-coated PES, where the sputtering temperature and 
thickness of ITO is fixed at 200 oC and 500Å. 
Additionally, the ITO film sputtered at 200 oC exhibited a much higher 
conductivity, more than two times that at room temperature, which would 
consequently result in a higher refractive index and cause a change in micro-resonator 
length. Since the device structure, including layer thickness, and the materials used 
were kept the same, the corresponding micro-resonator length of the device may have 
been affected mainly by the change in the refractive index of ITO and its change may 
cause emission shift. To verify, further experiments regarding  whether the emission 
shift is toward bluish or reddish and marked or not are worthy pursuing. 
Although SiO2 is known to be passivation effective[9] and thicker layers are 
preferred, its addition can positively or negatively affect the power efficiency, 
depending on its thickness. For examples, the power efficiency of the device with 
0.03wt% DCM2 doped BANE on PES was 2.4 lm/W without SiO2. The 
corresponding values were 1.3, 2.0, 4.1, 1.5, and 1.0 lm/W for SiO2 layers of 
thickness 50, 100, 150, 300 and 500Å. As revealed, the power efficiency was 
increased only with the addition of 150Å SiO2, and decreased if much thinner or 
thicker than 150Å. As shown in Fig. 4, the ITO film deposited on PES pre-coated with 
a 150Å SiO2 showed a smoothest surface structure, with a roughness of 14 ± 1Å.  
Rougher surface was observed for SiO2 much less than 150Å due to discontinuous

of effectively modulating the transporting-flux of hole in hole-injection-layer. One 
typical example shows a blue OLED, having initially a near record-high 
power-efficiency of 18.0 lm/W at 100 cd/m2,[18] to be doubled to 35.8 lm/W, as an 
amino functional-group modified PND is employed. Substantial advance in 
power-efficiency offers OLEDs high potential to become a more competitive display, 
having better energy-saving, longer stand-by time and even the most desired longer 
lifetime characters. 
Previous studies at depositing quantum-dot into emissive layer or incorporating 
nano-dot in non-emissive layer have shown significant efficiency improvement, but 
only for low-efficiency devices.[10–17] However, no report has yet revealed these 
approaches to be effective as well on high-efficiency devices, seriously limiting their 
practical applicability. The low electroluminescence (EL) efficiency may be attributed 
to a number of causes, including high carrier-injection-barrier, [4,10–12,17,20–23,26,27] poor 
carrier- and exciton-confinement,[10,11,22–27] exciton forming on guest,[25] poor 
energy-transfer efficiency,[10–12,23–27] exciton-quenching on guest molecules,[10,22–25] 
intrinsically low material electroluminescence,[10,19,23] and, most critically, imbalanced 
carrier-injection,[4,10–12,17,19–23,27] which frequently leads to poor recombination 
probability due to excessive injecting holes or electrons. A recent work incorporating 
small polymeric nano-dot in non-emissive layer showed 350% efficiency 
improvement on a white OLED with power-efficiency of 6.8 lm/W.[11] The overall 
efficiency is, however, still low even though the relative improvement is strikingly 
sound.  
In this report, we present the first discovery of using small polymeric 
(polysilic-acid) nano-dots with a high surface charge, either negative or positive, to 
markedly enhance the efficiency of high-efficiency OLEDs of either monochromic or 
white emission. Taking the most crucial blue emission, for example, upon the 
incorporation of an amino-functionalized PND, power-efficiency of 35.8 lm/W at 100 
cd/m2, a 99% improvement, is obtained for a blue OLED, which has, initially, a near 
record-high power-efficiency of 18.0 lm/W.[18] At high luminance, such as 1,000 
cd/m2, the efficiency was also enhanced from 12.4 to 21.2 lm/W, a marked 
enhancement of 71%. Importantly, the incorporated concentration of PND required is 
so small that all the originally outstanding EL characters are little affected, while the 
modulation in hole-transporting-flux is very effective to balance the injection of hole 
against electron. These results ensure the present method to be also effective for other 
  12
Results and Discussion 
 
Figure 2. (a) Schematic illustration of the molecular structures of the four different 
PNDs studied; they are Am-PND, V-PND, Al-PND and H-PND, respectively. (b) 
Incorporation effects of different PNDs at 0.7 wt% on the current density of a 
hole-transporting-only device that consists a hole-injection-layer of PEDOT: PSS 
sandwiched by a high-work-function electrode-pair. The symbols of circle, 
reversed-triangle, square, triangle, and diamond are designated for Am-PND, V-PND, 
Al-PND, H-PND, and that without PND, respectively. The Am-PND added device 
shows a lowest current density among all, implying that its highest positive charge is 
capable of repelling most effectively the injection of hole due to the strongest repulsive

bis(3,5-difluoro-2-(2-pyridyl)-phenyl-(2-carboxypyridyl) iridium (III) (FIrpic) doped in 
a molecular host of 4,4’-bis(carbazol-9-yl) biphenyl (CBP), a 32 nm 
1,3,5-tris(N-phenyl-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi) electron-transporting layer, a 0.7 
nm lithium fluoride layer, and a 150 nm aluminum cathode layer.  
The optimized concentrations for the nano-dots of V-PND and Al-PND are also 
around 0.7 wt%, and their respective power-efficiencies are 30.0 and 29.1 lm/W, whilst 
7 wt% for H-PND with a corresponding power-efficiency of 24.6 lm/W (Figure 3a). 
The reason why the optimized concentration is comparatively higher for H-PND may 
be due to its much lower charge intensity, which consequently requires higher 
concentration of hole-trapping nano-dots to sufficiently reduce the transporting-flux of 
holes in order to achieve a optimum carrier recombination.

(b) current density, and (c) luminance of a blue device, comprising a 125 nm indium tin 
oxide anode layer, a 35 nm PEDOT: PSS hole-injection layer, a 35 nm 
solution-processed blue emissive layer of 16 wt% 
bis(3,5-difluoro-2-(2-pyridyl)-phenyl-(2-carboxypyridyl) iridium (III) (FIrpic) doped in 
a molecular host of 4,4’-bis(carbazol-9-yl) biphenyl (CBP), a 32 nm 
1,3,5-tris(N-phenyl-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene electron-transporting layer, a 0.7 nm 
lithium fluoride layer, and a 150 nm aluminum cathode layer. Note that the best 
power-efficiency, 24.6 lm/W, shown for the H-PND added device in Figure 3a is 
obtained at its optimized concentration, i.e. 7 wt%; its efficiency is 20.1 lm/W if at 0.7 
wt%.  
  16
Figure 4 shows the incorporating concentration effect of different PNDs on the 
current density of the Am-PND, V-PND, Al-PND and H-PND containing blue OLEDs. 
As seen, all the current densities shown above decrease as the PND concentration 
increases, confirming all the modified PNDs to be effective in hole-modulation. 
However, incorporating excessive PND leads to over-reduction of the holes entering in 
the emissive layer, causing a reversed hole-poor and electron-rich imbalance, and 
consequently a poor efficiency.  
Figure 3c shows the incorporation effects of nano-dots on the luminance of the 
blue OLED. The device exhibits its brightest emission as Am-PND is incorporated, 
explaining why the Am-PND incorporated blue device shows a best power-efficiency 
and a highest efficiency improvement, as revealed previously. It is important to note 
that the recombination zone of this device is concentrated at near the interface of the 
hole-injection layer and the emissive layer because the interface simultaneously 
possesses both hole- and electron-blocking functions for having, respectively, a 
hole-blocking-barrier of 0.9 eV and an electron-blocking-barrier of 0.6 eV. 
Recombination taking place in a narrow region would result in excessively populated 
excitons generated therein, causing exciton quenching, which would consequently 
decrease the luminance and likewise the efficiency.[28] Instead, the Am-PND added 
device shows a highest luminance among all, indicating in which exists a highest 
recombination probability and a widest recombination region. This may be attributed to 
the presence of a high repulsive field arising from the high-charge Am-PNDs (Figure 
2c), and only high energy holes have a higher probability to pass through the repulsive 
barriers, and thereafter penetrate even deeper into the emissive layer, causing the 
recombination to occur in a wider region, and hence a higher recombination probability, 
leading to a brighter emission. The same postulation may also apply to the 
high-negative-charge V-PND added device that exhibits relatively high brightness. The 
only difference herein is that the holes entering from the anode must also possess high 
energy to overcome the high trapping field, instead of a repulsive field, arising from the 
high-negative-charge V-PND (Figure 2c), in order to successfully inject into the desired 
emissive layer.  
It is surprising to observe that the Al-PND (+10 mV) added device exhibits higher 
luminance (14%) than that of the V-PND (-8 mV) counterpart, by realizing that their 
charge intensities are not much different. Generally speaking, the observed luminance 
increases as the charge intensity increases, based on the same charge character. 
However, the dependency of luminance on charge intensity is not marked. Taking the 
H-PND and V-PND for examples, the luminance increases from 76 to 79 cd/m2 at 4.5V, 
an increase of 4%, as its negative charge intensity increases from 5 to 8 mV. Therefore, 
the marked difference in luminance between the Al-PND and V-PND added devices 
  18
PND concentration may vary with varying host/guest combination due to different 
carrier trapping characteristics. 
Besides the blue OLED, the Am-PND incorporation is also very effective for 
OLEDs of other emission, including a green OLED containing 12.5 wt% 
tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium (III) [Ir(ppy)3], a red OLED containing 3 wt% 
bis[2-(2’-benzothienyl)-pyridinato-N,C3’] (acetyl-acetonate) iridium (III) 
[(Btp)2Ir(acac)] and a white OLED composing 0.3 wt% red dye of (Btp)2Ir(acac), 0.08 
wt% green dye of Ir(ppy)3 and 14 wt% blue dye of FIrpic. Their respective 
power-efficiency increments are 57%, 31% and 54% (Figure 4). It is noteworthy that 
these results are obtained merely on basis of the optimized incorporation concentration 
for the blue device, which is 0.7 wt%. The optimized concentration may be different for 
other device systems. Much better improvement may be achieved for these three 
devices if their optimized concentrations are employed after further investigation.

3. Experimental 
Preparation of PSA nanodots： 
The incorporated PSA nanodots were prepared by hydrolysis and condensation of 
sodium metasilicate in 2.5 N hydrochloric acid solution for 40 minutes. 
Synthesis and characterization the functionalized polymeric-nano-dots： 
The procedure for preparing the H-PND used is described below.[29] A solution 
of 60 g H-PND precursor, sodium metasilicate, in 200 ml deionized water is added 
into 200 ml hydrochloric acid solution (2.5 M) with stirring at 0 °C for 5 min. 
Subsequently, 200 ml tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 60 g sodium chloride are 
sequentially added into the above solution with stirring for 10 min. After standing for 
another 10 min, the resultant solution mixture is separated into two layers. The 
desired organic part (THF) is obtained by leaching out the aqueous solution, and is 
further dried by adding 30 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The resultant H-PND 
containing solution is left to stand for several hours before the clean upper portion is 
taken for further experiments. The resultant H-PND is further reacted with 
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, n-octyltrimethoxysilane and vinyltrimethoxysilane to 
give the respective Am-PND, Al-PND and V-PND. The electrokinetic potential (Zeta 
potential) of all the resultant PNDs are measured by using dynamic light scattering 
measurement (Zeta Sizer nano-S).  
Fabrication and physical characterization the functionalized-PNDs added OLED： 
The first step is spin-coating a 35 nm hole-injection-layer (HIL) on a pre-cleaned 
indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate under nitrogen. The HIL is composd of PEDOT: PSS 
doped with different incorporation concentrations of the functionalized PNDs. The 
second step is depositing a 35 nm emissive layer via wet-procress by the use of a 
premixed solution with a desired host/guest composition. A 32 nm 
electron-transporting layer is then deposited at 2×10-5 torr. Finally, a 0.7 nm lithium 
fluoride layer and a 150 nm aluminum layer are deposited. 
Measurement： 
All the devices are measured without encapsulation and under ambient condition. 
The emissive area of all the devices are 27±3 mm2 and only the luminance in the 
forward direction is measured. The luminance and CIE chromatic coordinates of the 
resulting OLEDs are measured by using a Minolta CS-100A luminance meter. The 
current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the PND added OLEDs are recorded by using

The 6th National and Global Chinese Conference of Organic Molecule

發表論
文題目
Sunlight-style OLED
The Conference invited not only over 170 scientific papers on OLED and OLED related fields, but
also 10 presentations about the current progress of OLED related industrial technologies. Attendees,
especially those of Chinese spoken, had benefited very much from such a conference since the
official language was Chinese.
FUNSOM of Soochow University, like COSDAF in Hong Kong City University, was initiated by
the efforts of Professor S.T. Lee. Ten some outstanding scholars have been recruited thereto,
tending to make Soochow U a famous college in China or even in the world in the near future.
Many of the new faculties have published many high quality papers, including those in Nature
series journals. Although it just started for one year, FUNSOM did have a very good start. Given
time, it will surely become famous. In contrast, the FUNSOM counterpart of NTHU should sort out
its own needs and plays, and figure out its track toward excellence.
China has invested 30,000,000 RMB for 2 years on the Key Laboratory of Advanced Display and
System Applications, Shanghai University, aiming to develop AM-OLED display based on
microcrystal TFT technology. Taiwan had, in the past years, invested tremendously high amount of
money on some research topics, mainly aiming for academic excellence. The difference between the
two investments is innovation. The one invested by China is aiming for innovation, in accordance
with that emphasized by EU.
三、建議
Chinese are the majority in the world. Chinese scientists or engineers, though scattered around, still
the major contributors in numerous fields. Lacking language proficiency has seriously retarded our
further advancement and/or achievement recognition worldwide. The Conference held in Shanghai
this time had provided many Chinese spoken field experts countless timely and important scientific
and technological information. To gain global competitiveness, Taiwan as well as NTHU should not
only often hold international conferences or workshops, especially on the crucial fields, but also
hold with Chinese as the official language. Hence, we as well as the young scientists and engineers
from around the world can directly communicate to one another, speeding up the learning of any
new science or technology and consequently the advancement of R&D in any chosen filed.
The FUNSOM counterpart of NTHU, Nano and Materials Center, should form a strong link with
FUNSOM and COSDAF so that we can build up a world-class center without much waste.

三、建議
One advantage the attendees in PIERS 2010 would easily find is that rapid communication and
extensive achievement exchange among domain experts are served. The symposium really had
provided a good platform to boost the exchange of filed knowledge timely and very likely some
consequent collaboration opportunities. Especially, it was held in China. The short travelling
distance would always be in favor to gather experts from China and Taiwan etc, leading to the
formation of a stronger collaborative bond cross-strait. Greater academic or technological outcomes
may henceforth arise on currently available limited resources.
Hence, it is suggested that attendance to international conferences held in local or nearby area
should be encouraged. Function like that provided by PIERS is quite helpful for the promotion to
greater achievement. NTHU or NSC should encourage colleges and professional associations to
hold and attend like conferences as frequent as possible.
