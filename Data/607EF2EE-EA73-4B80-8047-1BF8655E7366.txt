1. INTRODUCTION 
Kaolinite is a common clay mineral found in sediments, soils, hydro thermal deposits and sedimentary rocks.  
Clay minerals play an important role in the fields of civil, geotechnical, and construction engineering. 
Electro-osmotic chemical treatment has been applied to improve the strength of soft clays, which mainly 
consist of kaolinite. Since 1930 electro-osmosis has been used as a tool in geotechnical engineering to 
improve the mechanical strength of soft clays. Casagrande and Casagrande (1986) tried to improve the 
strength of sensitive silty clay by electro-osmosis. Fundamental aspects of electro-osmosis in soils were 
reported by Gray and Mitchell (1967). Coelho et al. (1996) reported electro-osmotic phenomena in porous 
media. Beddiar et al. (2005) reported the influence of pH on pore water pressure.  
To enhance the effect of electroosmotic improvement, injection of chemical solutions into soil during 
electroosmosis was adopted in recent years (Ozkan et al., 1999; Lefebvre and Burnotte, 2002; Alshawabkeh 
and Sheahan, 2003; Mohamedelhassan and Shang, 2003; Alshawabkeh et al., 2004; Asavadorndeja and Glawe, 
2005; Burnotte et al., 2004; Paczkowska, 2005; Otsuki et al., 2007; Ou et al., 2009a; Abdullah et al., 2010). 
The technique sometimes is termed as the electroosmotic chemical treatment (ECT). With the ECT soil 
improvement, a substantial strength increase can be gained by chemical reactions in the soil matrix including 
cation exchange, cementation, and precipitation other than consolidation. However, most of the ECT soil 
improvement only occurs in the region near the anode or cathode. This may be attributed to the fact that acidic 
and alkaline conditions are developed in an area around the anode and cathode, respectively, due to 
electrolysis during electroosmosis, and the chemical reaction between injecting chemical solutions and soil 
preferably occurs under acidic or alkaline environments, which in turns produces cementing agents, leading to 
cementation between soil particles near the anode or cathode. 
Dewatering of soils during electro-osmosis involves movement of fluid; as a result pore water is pulled, 
along with ions, towards one of the electrodes. The dewatering process leads to consolidation and consequent 
strength increase in soils until intergranular stresses are in equilibrium with the tension that develops in the 
pore water during electro-osmosis. Additional strength is gained by chemical reactions in the soil matrix 
including cation exchange, cementation, and precipitation (Chen and Murdoch 1999, Alshawabkeh and 
Sheahan 2003, Mohamedelhassan and Shang 2003, Alshawabkeh and Sheahan 2004, Burnotte et al. 2004, 
Asavadorndeja and Glawe 2005, Paczkowska 2005, Otsuki et al. 2007, Angelica et al. 2008, Chien et al. 2009, 
Ou et al. 2009). However, these chemical reactions usually occur when the pH of the soil is high, i.e., 
precipitation usually occurs when the pH of the soil is greater than seven. Therefore, soil pH plays an 
important role as a physic-chemical parameter in these chemical reactions during electro-osmosis. (Acar and 
Alshwabakeh 1993, Alshawabkeh and Acar 1996, Asavadorndeja and Glawe 2005, Beddiar et al. 2005, Otsuki 
et al. 2007). At this juncture, it is important to understand the relationship between a soil’s concentration of 
ions, variations in pH, and improvement of strength during electro-osmotic chemical treatment in soft clays. 
Generally, calcium chloride solution is often used as an injection material during electro-osmotic chemical 
treatment. 
Calcium chloride and sodium silicate have been used as grouting material in sandy soil in the past 
because of their noticeable advantages such as non-toxicity, non-contamination and inexpensivity. However, 
injection of calcium chloride and sodium silicate solutions into clay soils by hydraulic pressure will cause 
hydraulic fracturing, which undermines the improvement. Since Ca2+ in the calcium chloride solution and 
SiO32- in the sodium silicate solution may migrate in clay under the electric field, calcium chloride and 
sodium silicate solutions can be beneficial as injection material during electroosmosis for clay, which may 
induce good cementation between particles under the electric field. The author and his coworkers have found 
through laboratory and field experiments that injection of the calcium chloride solution followed by the 
injection of the sodium silicate solution during electroosmosis can strengthen soft clay substantially (Chien et 
al. 2009; Ou et al., 2009b; Chang et al. 2010; Chien et al., 2010; Chien et al., 2011). However, similar to most 
of the ECT, the improvement was also limited to the area near the anode. Moreover, concentration of injected 
solutions, their injection time and injection procedure still remains to be resolved. . 
The objective of this study is to investigate the behavior of soil cementation through a series of ECT 
tests and to establish a suitable injection procedure for the injection of the calcium chloride solution followed 
by the injection of the sodium silicate solution. With the established procedure, the region of improvement 
during ECT tests expects to be expanded, preferably from anode to cathode in the laboratory tests and field 
test. Moreover, a series of tests was carried out by injecting different concentrations of CaCl2 solution over 
4 
 
condition. Thus the water content after consolidation was equal to 51%. Table 1 lists the physical properties of 
the soil. As listed in Table 1, the liquid limit and plastic limit were 46% and 25%, respectively. 
A total of eleven ECT tests were performed for type B (Table 2). The soil sample was first consolidated 
at 30 kPa pressure in increments and then it was treated by injecting chemical solutions during electroosmosis 
under the consolidation pressure of 30 kPa. A voltage gradient of 50 V/m was adopted for all tests, as 
suggested by Mitchell (1993). After setting up the specimen, A series of ECT tests were carried out by 
injecting CaCl2 with a concentration of 1.5N over 12, 24 and 48 hours, which denote as TC12, TC24 and 
TC48, respectively. Another series of ECT tests were carried out by injecting sodium silicate with different 
concentrations of 1:20, 1:10, 1:2, 1:1 and 1:0.5 (volume of sodium silicate: volume of water), which denote as 
TS(1:20), TS(1:10), TS(1:2), TS(1:1) and TS(1:0.5), respectively. For the TCS type of tests, the calcium 
chloride solution was first injected through the anode for 24, 36 and 48 hours, respectively, during 
electroosmosis, followed by injection of the sodium silicate solution with a ratio of volume of 1: 1(sodium 
silicate: water). Electroosmosis was executed for a total of 7 days of treatment time for TS and TCS series of 
tests. The conditions for all tests are summarized in Table 2. 
The soil’s cone resistance before and after the electroosmosis with chemical injection was measured by 
using a specially designed laboratory cone penetration apparatus. It is attached to an adjustable rod of 9.2 mm 
in diameter that is capable of measuring the cone resistance at different locations and depths. Fig. 3 shows the 
dimension of the laboratory cone. The cone resistance values were measured at various locations throughout 
the specimen before and after treatment, as shown in Fig. 4. The cone resistance for the untreated soil was 
found to be 50 kPa. 
For comparison, two benchmark tests were performed. The “Blank” test was soil treated with 
electroosmosis with the injection of deionized water for 24 hours. The pure electroosmosis (EO) test is soil 
treated with pure electroosmosis, i.e., no injection of water or chemical solutions, until no water drained from 
the cathode. The treatment time was about 144 hours. 
 
2.3 Field test 
The field test was performed in the Taipei area. A detailed subsurface geological profile for the test site is 
shown in Fig. 5. As listed in the Fig. 5, the deposit is mainly consisted of soft silty clays overlying a layer of 
sand. The ECT test was planned to execute at the depths of 1.5 m to 4.5 m below the ground surface. Fig. 5 
also lists the results of the SPT tests and the physical properties of the soil before the ECT. 
As shown in Figure 6, perforated steel pipes, 50 mm in diameter, 2 mm in wall thickness and with 5 mm 
holes drilled at 50 mm spacing along the pipe, were employed as electrodes. The holes were drilled along 
surface of the pipes to allow the chemicals to flow into the soil, which can also be served as for discharging 
water during electroosmosis. The electrodes embedded into soil were 4.5 m below ground surface. Since 
depths between 1.5 m and 4.5 m below the ground surface were to be treated, electrodes were therefore 
necessary to be insulated from ground surface to 1.5 m below ground surface by putting several layers of 
varnish on the pipe surface. Six electrodes, as arranged by one type of grids, 1.5×2.0 m, were installed in the 
test area, as shown in Figure 6.  
A suitable operation process (SOP) of electroosmotic chemical treatment was performed by using 
injection of the calcium chloride solution until decrease of current followed by the injection of the sodium 
silicate solution until no drained from the cathode during electroosmosis. Two series of step were conducted, 
designated as “injection with calcium chloride” and “injection with sodium silicate”. The electrical circuiting 
was arranged so that the row A electrodes were functioned as the anode, row B were functioned as the cathode. 
From this electrode configuration, the chemical solutions would be injected from the electrodes of row A 
while the water would be discharged from the electrodes of row B. It is noted that the calcium chloride 
solution (CaCl2) with the 1.5 N concentration and the sodium silicate solution (Na2O‧nSiO2, n=3.4) with a 
sodium silicate volume/water volume ratio 1:1 was used as the injection materials. Figure 6 show the layout 
and profile of the treated region. During the treatment, electric current was monitored. 
The CPT tests were conducted to investigate the changes in strength properties of the silty clay after 
treatment. Figure 6 also displays the location of the CPT tests. After the CPT tests, the test site was excavated 
to inspect the treatment result.

3.1.3 Concentration of calcium 
The concentration of Ca2+ ions in soil after treatment is shown in Fig. 9. When different concentrations 
of CaCl2 (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 N) were injected, in conjunction with 2, 4, 8 and 16 hour treatment times, no 
significant change in concentration of Ca2+ was observed from anode to cathode except for the 16 hour 
samples at the NC position (Figs. 9a to 6c). A significant increase in concentration of Ca2+ was observed with 
the increasing treatment time and concentration for the samples receiving 24 and 120 hour treatment. With the 
24 hour treatment time, the concentration of Ca2+ in kaolinite was increased at the NC position (to 23.04 mg/g, 
21.89 mg/g and 50.94 mg/g) when concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 N were used, respectively. With the 120 
hour treatment, a prominent change in concentration of Ca2+ was observed at the M, FC and NC positions and 
reached a maximum of 117.8 mg/g, 133.6 mg/g and 137.0 mg/g when concentrations of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 N 
were used, respectively. 
 
3.1.4 Cone resistance 
Figures 10(a) to 10(c) illustrate the effect of the concentrations of 0.5 N, 1.0 N, and 1.5 N with 2, 4, 8, 
and 16 hour treatment times on the cone resistance. When different concentrations of CaCl2 (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 
N) were injected with 2, 4, 8 and 16 hour treatment time, no significant increase of cone resistance was 
observed from anode to cathode, especially from the NA to the FC positions. At the NA position, the cone 
resistance was increased slightly due to cation exchange and decrease of water content (effect of 
electro-osmosis) for samples of 2, 4, and 8 hour exposure. The entire samples’ cone resistance decreased and 
became zero at the M position and remained zero up to the NC position. When the treatment time was 16 
hours, the cone resistance was increased slightly at the NC position due to a small amount of precipitation of 
Ca2+. The variation of the pH and concentration of Ca2+ near the cathode (Figs. 8 and 9) confirms the above 
cone resistance behavior.  
Figures 10(d) to (f) show the effect of the concentrations of 0.5 N, 1.0 N, and 1.5 N with 24 and 120 
hour treatment times on the cone resistance. A remarkable increase in the cone resistance for the soils with the 
120 hour treatment time was observed, compared with the samples receiving a 24 hour treatment time. The 
cone resistances in the NC region for clay which underwent a 120 hour treatment time at all three 
concentrations of CaCl2 were larger than those for other treatment time and reached to 1,007 kPa, 1,514 kPa 
and 2,909 kPa, for 0.5 N, 1.0 N and 1.5 N concentrations, respectively.  
 
3.1.5 Discussion 
In electro-osmotic chemical treatment with injection of saline solutions, the formation of cementing 
agents primarily depends upon soil pH values and availability of free calcium ions in the system 
(Asavadorndeja and Glawe 2005).  
When calcium ions are injected during electro-osmotic chemical treatment, two reaction mechanisms, ion 
exchange and pozzolanic reaction, are responsible for increase of strength. The region of OH in kaoline group 
minerals plays an important role in ion exchange reactions during electro-osmotic chemical treatment. Cliff et 
al (2008) characterized the OH region of kaolin-group minerals with the help of low temperature FTIR from 
different parts of the world. The ion exchange reaction of calcium ions and other monovalent ions leads to 
flocculation and coagulation of soil particles into large colloids. The pozzolanic reaction primarily occurs 
between siliceous materials and slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or between siliceous material and aluminates, 
forming calcium silicate hydrates (CSH) or calcium aluminate hydrates (CAH) (Diamond and Kinter 1965), a 
cementing agent that binds the soil particles together. The ion exchange reaction is relatively fast but provides 
minor strength increases while the pozzolanic reaction is comparatively slow, but this process causes 
significant strength increases (Assarson et al. 1974). 
The pozzolanic reaction is as follows: 
  Ca2+ + 2(OH)- +SiO2  --------->  CSH (Calcium Silicate Hydrate) 
Ca2+ + 2(OH)- +Al2O3  --------->  CAH (Calcium Aluminate Hydrate) 
In general, during electrolysis H+ and OH- ions will be generated at the anode and cathode respectively: 
At the anode    2H2O – 4e- → O2 + 4H+  
  At the cathode   2H2O + 2e- → H2 + 2OH-  
Hence, the pH drops near the anode and increases near the cathode during electrolysis. As a result, acidic 
and alkaline conditions will be developed near the anode and cathode, respectively during electro-osmosis 
8 
 
electroosmosis) for all treatment time. No significant increase in the cone resistance was observed from the 
FA to the FC.  
The cone resistance in the NC region was increased from 50 kPa (untreated soil) up to 104 kPa, 171 kPa 
and 437 kPa for the 12, 24, and 48 hour treatment time, respectively. The cone resistance in the NC region 
increased moderately for the short treatment time, for example, 12 hours, probably due to a little increase in 
the concentration of Ca2+ and change in pH value. The cone resistance at the NC position increased 
remarkably for the 48 hour treatment time, compared with those receiving the 12, 24 hour treatment time. It 
may be attributed to the relatively large increase in the concentration of Ca2+ and pH value and longer 
treatment time, which the precipitation of Ca2+ and the formation of CSH were needed. 
 
3.2.2 TS tests─Injection of the sodium silicate solution only 
Fig. 15 shows the variation of the pH with positions for different concentrations of the sodium silicate 
solution. A significant change in the pH value was observed from the anode to the cathode for all tests. The 
soils in these tests were all in the alkaline condition, with the pH reaching a maximum of 11.9 occurring in 
TS(1:0.5). The alkaline condition in the tests increased with the injected concentration of the sodium silicate 
solution. 
The concentration of Ca2+ in soil after treatment is shown in Fig. 16. As shown in the figure, when the 
sodium silicate solution was injected, the concentration of Ca2+ at the NA to FC positions was decreased while 
it was increased at the NC position. Basically, the concentration of Ca2+ was little affected by the injected 
concentration of the sodium silicate solution. This may due to the fact that the Ca2+ originally existing in 
kaolinite migrated to the cathode by the drag of electric force during electroosmosis, leading to the increase of 
the concentration of Ca2+ near the cathode. It is therefore inferred that the concentration of Ca2+ should be 
dependent on the applied voltage and treatment time rather than the injected concentration of the sodium 
silicate solution.  
Fig. 17 illustrates the effect of the sodium silicate concentration on the cone resistance. As shown in the 
figure, a significant increase in the cone resistance was observed at the NA position for all tests. The cone 
resistance in this region generally increased with the increase of the concentration of the sodium silicate 
solution.  
For the tests of low concentration of the sodium silicate solution like TS(1:2), TS(1:10), and TS(1:20), 
the entire samples’ cone resistance was decreased considerably, even equal to zero, from FA to NC. The soil in 
these regions behaved as quick clay, a semi-solid material, which became fluid-like material when it was 
disturbed. A typical photo of quick clay as obtained from TS (1:10) is shown in Fig. 18. It may be due to the 
fact that a small amount of Na+, due to the injection of the low concentration of the sodium silicate solution, 
migrating toward the cathode caused the thickness of double layer of clay to increase, leading the formation of 
the disperse clay structure, that is, phenomenon of quick clay. 
Similar to the low concentration of the sodium silicate solution, injection of high concentration of the 
sodium silicate solution like TS(1:0.5) also induced quick clay, almost occurring in the entire specimen except 
for the NA region. The phenomenon can be explained by the voltage observed at the different positions (Fig. 
19). It is justified that the increase of cone resistance and cemented area caused a relatively large electric 
voltage drop near the anode, compared with the other tests. The residual voltage, just only 0.008 V/mm 
between FA to NC position, was too small to pull the hydrated water to the cathode while the sodium silicate 
solution was constantly injected into the soil, causing the accumulation of water in soil. Quick clay was thus 
formed.  
On the other hand, a significant increase in the cone resistance for TS(1:1) was observed at all positions 
though the cone resistance at the NC position was still not very large. It is inferred that a reasonable number 
of SiO22- was brought toward the cathode by the electroosmotic flow. Thus, the SiO22- distributing from NA to 
FC, basically in the acidic environment, reacted with the H+, forming the silicate gel. The clay particles was 
thus expected to be bound together, forming stiff cemented soil and the cone resistance could be very high 
under such conditions. The average cone resistances for TS(1:1) reached 2108 kPa, 2796 kPa 1188 kPa and 
1354 kPa from NA to FC positions, respectively. The cone resistance was relatively large and improvement 
region was higher for TS(1:1) treatment, compared with the other tests. Hence, a ratio of 1:1 (sodium silicate: 
water) was selected as a suitable concentration.  
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 17, no significant increase in the cone resistance was observed near the 
10 
 
Fig. 24 shows the variation of the volume of drained water with treatment time for “Blank”, TC12, TC24 
and TC48. As shown in the figure, in the first 18 hours of treatment time, the amount of water drained from 
the cathode increased with time, approximately linearly. The amount of drained water was even greater than 
that of “Blank” during this period because injection of calcium ion can increase the electrical conductivity of 
water and more water was thus transported to the cathode and drained from there. After 18 hours, the rate of 
water discharge began to decrease with the increasing injection time. Nearly no water was drained from the 
cathode or little chemical solution could be injected after 36 hours of treatment time. This is because the soil 
was cemented near the cathode under the alkaline condition due to the precipitation of Ca2+ or the formation 
of CSH, thereby forming an impermeable layer around the cathode. The electroosmotic flow could not be 
discharged any more from the cathode due to the obstruction of the stiff cemented soil.  
Therefore, for the TCS treatment, injection time for the calcium chloride solution less than 18 hours 
seemed not enough to induce a sufficient cementation, probably due to insufficient amount of Ca2+ injected 
into the soil or insufficient time to form cementation agents like Ca(OH)2 or CSH. Following injection of the 
sodium silicate solution would not help to improve the soil much. Injection time for the calcium chloride 
solution greater than 36 hours may improve the soil near the cathode and will form an impermeable layer 
around the cathode. Little sodium silicate solution can be injected in the following injection and the soil from 
NA to FC would not be cemented as a result.  
Moreover, with the injection time for the calcium chloride solution set between the first turning point and 
the second turning point on the relational curve of the total drained water volume and treatment time, for 
example, an average of 24 hours, the sodium silicate solution can be effectively injected into the soil while 
Ca2+ moved toward the cathode constantly due to the electric force and simultaneously, some SiO32- was also 
brought toward the cathode by electroosmotic water flow. Therefore, SiO32- from NA to M may react with 
Ca2+ to result in the precipitation as CaSiO3 or react with H+ to form SiO2 (gel). The Ca2+ from M to NC may 
react with OH- to result in the precipitation of calcium as calcium hydroxide or react with Si4+, existing in 
nature soil, to form CSH. Since 24 hour was an average of the first and second turning points, not surprisingly, 
TC24S(1:1) has a better improvement result over the other tests.  
The chemical reaction formula for TC24S(1:1) would be 
From NA to M 
Ca2+ +SiO3 2-+H+→ CaSiO3 
Or 
SiO3 2-+H+ →SiO2 2 (gel) 
From M to NC 
Ca2+ +2OH- → Ca(OH)2(gel) 
Or 
Ca2+ +SiO3 2-+OH+→ CSH 
As far as field application is concerned, the suitable injection time for the calcium chloride solution can 
be obtained by the observation of the variation of the volume of drained water. When the first turning point on 
the relational curve of drained water volume and treatment time is reached, injection of the sodium silicate 
solution can be initiated until little sodium silicate solution can be injected. Right after the sodium silicate 
solution is injected, the soil will be cemented almost in all positions, thereby reducing the permeability of soil 
considerably. Under such condition, no more sodium silicate can be injected. The injection procedure is 
therefore termed as the suitable operation procedure (SOP). 
 
3.3 Field test 
The initial average cone resistance at the depth of 1.5 m and 4.5 m obtained from the cone penetration 
apparatus was about 1283 kPa as shown in Fig. 26. Fig. 28 also shows the undrained shear strength of soft 
clay at the depth of 1.5 m and 4.5 m before treatment was 74 kPa. 
 
3.3.1 Amount of current 
Fig. 25 shows the variation of current versus time for injection with calcium chloride and sodium silicate 
during electroosmosis. The current increased with time and then steadily decreased up to the end. As shown in 
Fig. 3, injection of the calcium chloride solution will cause the increase in the current previous 5 days. The 
12 
 
concentration of Ca2+. The pH (pH=10), concentration of Ca2+ ions (137.0 mg/g) and cone resistance 
(maximum 2209 kPa) increased significantly in the samples collected at the NC and the FC positions with 120 
hour treatment time. These results confirm that the improvement of the soil strength was mainly due to the 
precipitation and pozzolanic reactions of Ca2+ ions at the NC position of the cathode during electro-osmotic 
chemical treatment. 
Previous studies have shown that injection of the calcium chloride solution followed by the injection of 
the sodium silicate solution is effective to improve the soil. However, the concentration of the calcium 
chloride solution and sodium silicate solution, injection time of the calcium chloride solution and sodium 
silicate solution remain to resolved. 
Since the effect of soil cementation increased with the amount of calcium ion injected into the soil, to 
obtain a better improvement result, one needs to make the concentration of the calcium chloride solution as 
large as possible but also maintain its workability. The maximum of the 1.5N concentration is normally 
effective and workable.  
Injection of high concentration of the sodium silicate solution, for example, a ratio of 1 to 0.5 (sodium 
silicate: water) may cause the formation of quick clay from FA to NC region though the soil near NA was with 
the high cone resistance. Injection of the low concentration of the sodium silicate solution, for example, 
concentration less than the ratio of 1:1, might induce a lower cone resistance near NA and also caused the 
formation of quick clay from FA to NC. Test results revealed that a ratio of 1:1 could yield best improvement 
results. 
 Long injection time of the calcium chloride solution would induce the cementation or very low 
impermeability for the soil around the cathode, causing the adverse effect for the subsequent injection of the 
sodium silicate solution. If little sodium silicate solution was injected, the soil will not be cemented except for 
near the NA. Short injection time of the calcium chloride solution seemed not enough to induce a sufficient 
strength, probably due to insufficient amount of Ca2+ injected into the soil or insufficient time to form 
Ca(OH)2 or CSH. Following injection of the sodium silicate solution does not help to improve the soil much. 
The injection time for the calcium chloride solution set between the first turning point and the second turning 
point on the relational curve of total drained water volume and time resulted in better improvement result over 
the other types of injection.  
After the complete of the injection of the calcium chloride solution, the sodium silicate solution can be 
injected until the volume of the injected solution is nil. This is because SiO32- injected into the soil will react 
with Ca2+ and H+ from FA to FC, causing the soil cemented in the entire specimen and the permeability of soil 
was reduced considerably as a result. 
The injection procedure described above is therefore termed as the suitable operation procedure (SOP). 
The improvement region covered nearly the entire specimen from the anode and cathode and its average cone 
resistance could be raised to three times more than that of the untreated soil for field test. Hence, the region 
and strength of improvement can be efficiently enhanced by using the technique of SOP.
