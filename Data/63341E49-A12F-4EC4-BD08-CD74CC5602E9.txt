Abstract 
The applications of nano-crystal memory on fluorinated and nitrided high-k dielectrics have been 
emphasized in this project. Binary HfMo metal gate material with nitrogen incorporation has been 
employed for adjusting the work function. Wide range of work function from 4.17 eV to 5.16 eV can be 
obtained by incorporating different nitrogen concentration into HfMo material. It is useful for the 
application of CMOS technology, ultra-thin body SOI and flash memory devices. In addition, metal-rich 
GdOx and HfOx high-k dielectrics with different RTA temperatures and reactive gases were utilized for 
nano-crystal charge storages. Furthermore, SixGey nano-crystal material was also demonstrated as 
charge storages with nitrided tunneling oxide in order to exam the programming speed and data 
retention. It was found that the nitrided tunneling oxide acted as a barrier layer to prevent Ge atoms 
diffusion, and modified the energy band structure to enhance the programming performance.

Material Characterization 
Fig. 3(a) shows the binding energy of N(1s) 
peaks can be observed at 398.1eV in 4% and 12 
% of HfxMoyNz films. According to the 
comparison of these curves, there is no nitrogen 
peaks in XPS analysis of 0% film, and besides, 
the shift of the peak of nitrogen can further 
demonstrate its incorporation. In addition, Fig. 
3(b) and 3(c) show that both the peaks of Mo and 
Hf tend to shift toward high binding energy, and 
that means exactly the same phenomena of 
nitrogen incorporation. The difference between 
the peak intensity of Hf(4f) of 4% and 12% is 
shown in Fig. 3(c). An obvious decrease of 
intensity of 12% Hf(4f) peak can be observed 
while there is no such situation in both two of 
Mo(3d) metal gate electrodes as shown in Fig.5 
(b). The decrease of the intensity might be due to 
the incorporation of high nitrogen ratio [3]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nitrogen Effect on Work Function Modification 
In order to decouple the effect of oxide charge 
from the effective work function, the capacitors 
with different oxide thicknesses were fabricated 
to generate a VFB vs. EOT curve as shown in the 
inset of Fig. 4. The y-intercept of this curve 
indicated the effective work function (Фm,eff). The 
extracted Φm,eff values for HfxMoyNz gate 
electrode with different N2 flow ratio ranged from 
4.17eV (low N2) to 5.16eV (high N2) are shown 
in Fig. 4. According to the reference paper [4], 
the work function of Hf was modified by nitrogen 
(N) incorporation, and indeed the work function 
of HfNx can be tuned from 4.1eV (conduction 
band) to 4.55eV (midgap). In this work, for the 
first time, larger work function range than 
previous work is obtained forming co-sputtering 
HfxMoyNz metal gate. In addition, the Mo film 
with (110) orientation can maintain possessing 
high work function value suitable for p-channel 
devices [5]. This suggests that HfxMoyNz films 
have tunable effective work functions appropriate 
for both NMOS and PMOS devices.

研究主題#2: Highly Robust Thermal Stability of Metal-Rich Gd Nanocrystal Memory for High 
Density Flash Application (研究成果將投稿於國際會議論文) 
 
1. Introduction 
Recently, poly-Si-Oxide–Nitride–Oxide– 
Silicon (SONOS)-type structure memories, which 
include nitride and nanocrystal (NC) memories, 
have attracted much attention for their application 
in the next-generation nonvolatile memories. 
Unfortunately, for conventional SONOS memory, 
erase saturation and vertical stored charge 
migration are two major drawbacks, whereas for 
NC memories, the most challenging tasks are how 
to maintain acceptable charge capability of the 
discrete storage nodes and fabricate NC with 
constant size, high density, and uniform 
distributions. 
 In this work for the first time, we propose a 
novel metal-rich Gadolinium (Gd) [1] NC 
memory that is fully compatible with the current 
CMOS technologies. [2] The memory exhibits 
excellent thermal stability and can be applied into 
future high density Flash storage. 
 
2. Experiments 
The metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors 
(MOSCAP) were fabricated by n-type (100) 
wafers. First, a 3 nm tunnel oxide was thermally 
grown at 850oC in a horizontal furnace system 
after standard RCA clean. Next, a 10 nm 
amorphous HfO2 wetting layer was deposited by 
sputtering with pure hafnium (99.99% pure) 
target in an oxygen gas ambient. The sputtering 
process was performed with 7.6E-3 Torr at room 
temperature and with gas source of O2 (2 sccm) 
and Ar (20 sccm); the other one, Gd2O3 wetting 
layer, was deposited by sputtering with pure 
Gadolinium (99.9% pure) target in an oxygen gas 
ambient. The sputtering process was also 
performed with 7.6E-3 Torr at room temperature 
and with gas source of O2 (3 sccm) and Ar (21 
sccm); in which RF sputter power was set at 100 
W. These thin films were then subjected to RTA 
treatment in N2 ambient at 800oC, 900oC, 1000oC 
for 30 s and O2 ambient at 800oC, respectively. A 
10 nm blocking oxide were then deposited 
through plasma enhance chemical vapor 
deposition (PECVD). Subsequently, Al 
deposition, gate patterning, and backside Al 
deposition were completed to fabricate the 
metal-rich Hf and Gd NC memory capacitor. 
Flat-band voltages were extracted from the 
capacitance-voltage curves measured by HP 4285 
LCR meter. [3] 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Fig.1 displays the C-V hysteresis curves 
sweep from -10 V to 10 V, then 10 V to -10 V. 
As we observe, the hysteresis width of thin film 
decreases as the annealing temperatures increase 
to 1000oC. In addition, the hysteresis width of 
thin film annealed at N2 800oC is larger than O2 
800oC one. The maximum hysteresis width of 
thin film is obtained for the sample annealed at 
N2 800oC indicating the maximum NC density. 
The inner figure shows the C-V hysteresis curves 
demonstrated these capacitors are repeatable. In 
fig. 5, AFM images of Hf NC annealed at (a) N2 
800oC (b) N2 900oC (c) N2 1000oC are showed 
the different NC density of each film. As shown 
in fig.5 (a), (b), (c), the density of NC decreases 
and the size of NC increases as the RTA 
annealing temperature increases. These results 
 
Fig. 6 shows accelerated retention transients 
for Gd NC measured for different (a) temperature 
(85oC, 100oC, 125oC, 150oC) and (b) gate stress 
voltages (-9 V < Vg < -3 V). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, a novel high-k Gd NC memory 
is proposed and analyzed for the first time. The 
conventional Hf NC memory presents severe 
thermal stability problem, which is greatly 
improved by novel Gd NC memory. The charge 
retention and endurance are also superior for the 
Gd NC memory and this memory can be the 
candidate for next generation Flash memory 
applications.

1. Introduction 
As scaling of channel length goes down to sub-45nm 
generation, metal gate electrode [1] has the benefit on low 
gate resistance, eliminate poly depletion effect and boron 
penetration issue. IBM had announced to use different metal 
gates with Hafnium(Hf)- base gate dielectric for 45nm 
products [2]. It is expected they have complex integrated 
processes with high cost. A simple and low cost metal gate 
process development is necessary. In this work, a metal gate 
with full range work function modulation process has been 
first time demonstrated. The HfxMoy binary alloys cover the 
work function range from conduction to valance band (4.17~ 
5.16eV). It is believed that this process has the potential to 
be a cost effective on N and PMOS process integration. The 
crystal orientation, binding energy, and thermal stability of 
HfxMoyNz thin film was systematic investigated. 
2. Experiment 
Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors were 
fabricated in this study. The SiO2 dielectrics with thickness 
range form 100Å to 500Å were grown by thermal oxidation 
on p-type silicon substrate. After oxidation, HfxMoyNz 
(1000Å) gate electrode was deposited by co-sputtering at 
DC-sputter by 250W(Hf):200W(Mo) in N2 and Ar mixtures, 
with N2 flow ratio from 0% to 14%, respectively. HfxMoyNz 
gate was patterned by wet etching using the chemicals 
solution. Finally, 3000Å Al films were deposited on 
backside contact. The detail process flow and schematic 
MOS capacitors cross-section were shown in Fig.1 (a) and 
(b), respectively. For thermal stability study, the HfxMoyNz 
thin films deposited on 600 nm oxides were prepared also. 
The capacitance-voltage (CV) curves and resistivity of 
HfxMoyNz were measured by HP 4285 LCR meter and four 
point-probe meter, respectively. 
3. Results and Discussion 
Thermal Stability of HfxMoyNz Thin Films 
Fig. 2 shows the resistivity of HfxMoyNz films with 
different sputtered N2 flow ratio and post metal anneal 
(PMA) temperature. The resistivity of HfxMoyNz increased 
from 1.84×10-4 to 3.1×10-3 Ω-cm for all nitrogen ratios and 
nearly not affected by PMA. It can be seen that high 
temperature annealing had little effect on the resistivity of 
the film. In order to examine thermal stability, RTA anneal 
were performed for all samples at 700°C and 900°C, 
respectively. The XRD analysis is shown in Fig. 4. In this 
figure, we can observe that the lower resistivity of HfxMoyNz 
thin films were relative. And the resistivity tended to drop in 
high nitrogen ratio (8~14%) at 900°C . The without (W/O) 
anneal and 700°C anneal sample was not obvious peak for 
Mo5Si3 in Fig. 4 (a) and (b) , but the 900°C anneal sample 
was observed the peak of Mo5Si3 on XRD material analysis 
as shown in Fig 4 (c). It can be sure that the lower resistivity 
was caused by Molybdenum (Mo) silicides crystal formed in 
HfxMoyNz films.  
Material Characterization 
Fig.5 (a) shows the binding energy of N(1s) peaks can be 
observed at 398.1eV in 4% and 12 % of HfxMoyNz films. 
According to the comparison of these curves, there is no 
nitrogen peaks in XPS analysis of 0% film, and besides, the 
shift of the peak of nitrogen can further demonstrate its 
incorporation. In addition, Fig.5 (b) and (c) show that both 
the peaks of Mo and Hf tend to shift toward high binding 
energy, and that means exactly the same phenomena of 
nitrogen incorporation. The difference between the peak 
intensity of Hf(4f) of 4% and 12% is shown in Fig.5 (c). An 
obvious decrease of intensity of 12% Hf(4f) peak can be 
observed while there is no such situation in both two of 
Mo(3d) metal gate electrodes as shown in Fig.5 (b). The 
decrease of the intensity might be due to the incorporation of 
high nitrogen ratio [3]. 
Nitrogen Effect on Work Function Modification 
The C-V curves of HfxMoyNz /SiO2 gate stacks with 
different sputtered N2 flow ratio are shown in Fig. 6. In order 
to decouple the effect of oxide charge from the effective 
work function, the capacitors with different oxide 
thicknesses were fabricated to generate a VFB vs. EOT curve 
as shown in the inset of Fig. 7. The y-intercept of this curve 
indicated the effective work function (Фm,eff). The extracted 
Φm,eff values for HfxMoyNz gate electrode with different N2 
flow ratio ranged from 4.17eV (low N2) to 5.16eV (high N2) 
are shown in Fig. 7. According to the reference paper [4], the 
work function of Hf was modified by nitrogen (N) 
incorporation, and indeed the work function of HfNx can be 
tuned from 4.1eV (conduction band) to 4.55eV (midgap). In 
this work, for the first time, larger work function range than 
previous work is obtained forming co-sputtering HfxMoyNz 
metal gate. In addition, the Mo film with (110) orientation 
can maintain possessing high work function value suitable 
for p-channel devices [5]. This suggests that HfxMoyNz films 
have tunable effective work functions appropriate for both 
NMOS and PMOS devices. Table 1 shows relationship 
between crystal orientation of Mo films and work function 
of MOS capacitors [6]. 
4. Conclusions 
HfxMoyNz metal nitride has excellent thermal stability up 
to 900°C. By DC sputtering with increase N2 flow ratio form 
0% to 14%, the work function of HfxMoyNz gate electrode 
increases from 4.17eV (conduction band) to 5.16eV (valence 
band). This process is good enough for nMOSFET and 
pMOSFET applications.

一、參加會議經過 
會議第一天主要是註冊與熟悉環境並參加開幕與下午之會議，一大早在會議未開始
前我們就已到達會場，參觀了筑波國際會議中心以及會議之研討廳，由會議中心之設計
與軟體之架設不難想像日本國家在科技上之進步與普及，這樣人性化之設計是我們在台
灣所體會不到的。而在參觀後我們參加會議的開幕式，由此屆 SSDM 會議之委員長-橫山
直樹教授所主持，一開始介紹筑波市的周遭環境與風景區，而後主要介紹 SSDM 會議之演
進與未來，並介紹本屆所發表論文之國家組成與區域分佈，主要以本國日本所發表最多，
再來則是台灣，其次則是韓國。而本屆會議共有 712 件投稿數，是歷屆以來最多投稿的
一次，總共錄取 500 篇，其中 plenary talks 共三篇、invited talks 共 50 篇、oral
共 323 篇與 post 共 174 篇。另外早上還有三場 plenary talks，大致上講半導體科技之
發展與困難、有機電晶體之發展與其他科技之展望。其中第一場是由 Intel 公司所邀請
之學者來演講，演講中對於現今半導體之發展與待克服之困難點有精闢之講解，對於個
人在半導體上之見識有相當之助益。中午用餐過後就是 oral presentation 之議程，每
場約 20-30 分鐘，分別有十個主題在十個不同的演講廳舉行，而我主要選擇了 Advanced 
Gate Stack/Si Processing Science 和 Advanced Memory Technology 此兩領域來做聆
聽，其中在 Memory 領域中主要演講者大部份是由公司所來(如 Samsung 和 Toshiba)，因
此得到許多以公司觀點來看 DRAM 產品之發展與困難點，這是相當有趣且鮮少之經驗。而
第二天的議程重點就在於 post presentation 和 post time，在 post presentation 由
於我負責報告之論文共三篇，因此還蠻緊張的，不過還好都順利結束。在下午的 post time
中，可謂是本次收獲最大之處，兩個小時討論中，有許許多多學者來跟我請教相關研究
之問題與不懂之處，包括 IBM 來演講 NBTI 主題的 J. Yugami；日本學者；韓國學者與日
本做離子感測電晶體商品之先生…等，其中對我們所做之研究相當感興趣，並說想試試
看我們所用之方法，這對我們的研究也是相當之肯定與認同，而我也與他互相交換名片，
期待我們後續之討論。最後一天，我仍是選定一些主題參加 oral presentation 報告，
包含自己研究領域之 Micro/Nano Electromechanical and Bio-Systems 方面與 Advanced 
Gate Stack/Si Processing Science 方面。其中在 Micro/Nano Electromechanical and
