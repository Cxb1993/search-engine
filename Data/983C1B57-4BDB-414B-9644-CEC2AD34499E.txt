Estimation of Carrier Frequency Offset for Generalized OFDMA Uplink Systems 
Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms 
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
During the years, many wireless communication systems have been developed to fulfill the ever increasing demand of 
mobile multimedia services. Among them, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [1,2] is recognized as one 
promising transmission scheme for next generation (4G) wireless communications due to its many advantages. OFDM is a 
multicarrier modulation scheme which is robust against frequency selective channel and can cope with inter-symbol 
interference (ISI) resulting from multipath channel by using cyclic prefix (CP). In OFDM system the orthogonality between 
adjacent subchannels is essential for quality communications. However, the small spacing between adjacent subchannels 
makes the OFDM system very sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO) which is caused owing to the mismatched oscillators 
at transmitter and receiver, or the Doppler shift due to relative movement between transmitters and receiver (base station). The 
frequency offset will result in the loss of orthogonality among subchannels and thus inter-carrier interference (ICI) arises. 
Therefore, the estimation and compensation of frequency offset have become important research topics in OFDM systems 
since last two decades. This study will focus on the CFO estimation.  
The correlation-based method is a popular CFO estimation scheme since it is quick and simple. In [3] a correlation-based 
method is proposed for single-user OFDM systems. This method firstly divides an OFDM training symbol into two repetitive 
halves and then estimates CFO by calculating correlation of these two halves. In [4], a correlation-based approach is suggested 
to estimate CFO for OFDMA uplink systems in which the available subcarriers are divided into multiple groups for multiple 
users, and the base station (BS) receives signals from users with multiple CFOs. This approach separately estimates each CFO 
by correlating the CPs of two OFDM symbols. A major advantage of this scheme is redundancy-free in the transmitted signals.  
In the OFDMA uplink systems, BS receives multiple signals at a time, thus, multiple CFOs arise simultaneously which may 
result in multi-user interference (MUI). To address this problem, a method presented in [5] employs Hamming/Kaiser windows 
to eliminate MUI and then separately estimates each user’s CFO by correlating two repeated OFDM pilot symbols designed 
for each user. Notably, the methods proposed in [4] and [5] are developed for OFDMA systems with subband carrier 
assignment scheme (Subband CAS). Furthermore, the performance of correlation-based method degrades as the amount of 
CFO increases.  
To overcome the difficulty of correlation-based methods, ML-based approach has been explored in recent years [6, 7]. ML-
based scheme searches all possible solutions in the solution space and chooses the best one as final result. Theoretically, ML-
based approach can find the optimal solution and has the immunity against the amount of CFO. Unfortunately, its complexity 
is too high for practical application; especially when the solution space is multi-dimensional. Consequently, two complexity-
reduced ML estimators called alternating-projection frequency estimation (APFE) and approximate APFE (AAPFE) are 
proposed [7]. These two approaches iteratively estimate CFOs with performances approximate to that of the conventional ML 
method. However, these two methods only estimate one CFO at a time which is inefficiency. 
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was originally proposed by Eberhart and Kennedy in 1995 [8]. Unlike ML 
approach exhaustively finding all possible solutions in the solution space, PSO is a kind of evolutionary computation 
techniques like genetic algorithm (GA). It can estimate all CFOs at a time. PSO randomly generates some particles (candidate 
solutions), which fly in the space to find the best solution according to individual and whole experiences.  
In this paper, firstly, an OFDMA uplink system which consists of multiple transmitters, multipath Rayleigh fading channel, 
and a base station is built. Next, we derive a log-likelihood function with unknown parameters of CFOs, and then the original 
PSO (OPSO) algorithm is applied to estimate the CFOs. While the OPSO has much less computational complexity compared 
to ML-based scheme, its performance is unacceptable. Therefore, several new PSO algorithms are developed to improve the 
estimation performance. Finally, a series of simulations is conducted over Rayleigh fading channel to verify effectiveness of 
the proposed PSOs in CFO estimation. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the uplink OFDMA systems. Then a log-likelihood function with 
unknown parameters of CFOs is derived. Section III describes various PSO algorithms which include the OPSO, modified 
PSO, and our proposed PSO scheme with mutation, and their applications on CFO estimation. Simulation results are presented 
in Section IV and finally the conclusions are drawn in Section V.

B. Log-likelihood Function for CFOs Estimation 
Assume that the channel impulse response is known to the BS, and the training sequence of length N  is employed for 
CFO estimation. Notably, kx  is also known to the BS since it is the IFFT of training sequence kS . Following (4), y  can be 
expressed as a function of K  unknown CFOs ],...,,[ 21 Kεεε=ε  as below:

global search and smaller maxv  helps local search. Notably, maxv  determines the convergent speed of PSO. 
Shi and Eberhart [10] exploited inertia weight to improve the convergent feature of PSO algorithm. giv  is multiplied by a 
inertia weight w  to compromise the global search and local search. The renewed formulas are:

where w  is the inertia weight, which decreases linearly with the number of generations as follow:

wwww ×−−= minmaxmax  (17) 
where maxw  and  minw  are respectively the initial and final values of inertia weight. G  is the maximum number of 
generations (or iterations), and g  is the present number of iteration. In this method, particles move toward the target at a fast 
speed in the beginning. As the number of generation increases, particles are closer to the target, the velocity will be decreased 
to avoid larger moving distance such that particles would not leave away from the target. This modified PSO is termed LPSO 
in this study for convenience. 
Based on the LPSO, the research in [11] proposed a Catfish PSO, which was inspired by observing fisherman’s fishing 
sardines in Norway. Originally, the sardines are kept in a small tank on the boat while fisherman going back home. However, 
the sardines die due to lack of exercise in such a small space. To avoid this problem, fisherman adds some catfishes into the 
tank to excite the sardines to prevent them from dying. This method introduces this concept into PSO algorithm by removing 
10% bad particles (died sardines) and adding 10% new particles (Catfishes) at the boundary of the searching space (tank) to 
increase the searching diversity. It outperforms the original PSO algorithm but it needs to sort all particles for removing bad 
particles in every generation. 
B. Mutation Scheme for PSO 
To obtain particle diversity but with less computational complexity, a mutation scheme is proposed to be introduced into 
LPSO as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the first stage, M×1α  particles are selected. In the second stage, one mutation point for each 
selected particle is randomly chosen, and then is mutated with a rate of 2α . That is, the sign of each selected point is changed 
from positive (negative) to negative (positive) if a uniformly generated random number γ  is smaller than 2α . The second 
stage aims to increase particle diversity meanwhile prevent the population from being randomized. In other words, 2α  
compromises the diversity and convergence of the PSO algorithm.

B. Generation of Initial Population 
Conventionally, initial population of GA is randomly 
generated from solution space. In this work, the initial 
population is produced as follows: 
(1) Information bit 
Since the trial solution from the MRC is with certain 
degree of accuracy, the initial population with pN  
chromosomes is generated as follows: 
(i) / 4pN  trial solutions are produced to be initial values of 
GA based on the MRC output. 
(ii) Generate / 2pN  trial solutions by randomly altering a 
gene of chromosomes produced in (i). 
(iii) Generate / 4pN  trial solutions by randomly altering 3 
genes of chromosomes produced in (i). 
(2) CIR 
CIR consisting of complex numbers results in much bigger 
solution space. Therefore, the initial population is produced by 
altering multiple genes of trial solutions obtained from pilot-
based channel estimator. Ten sets of CIR string are provided 
from pilot-based channel estimator as initial values of GA. The 
remaining ( 10)pN −  CIR strings are generated by randomly 
altering 5 genes of the trial solutions obtained from pilot-based 
channel estimator.  
Then the data string and CIR string are combined as the 
initial chromosome. For example, the p-th initial chromosome 
pX  comprises the p-th data string pb  and p-th CIR string ph .

D. Selection 
In this research, both the roulette wheel and ranking-
based selection schemes [3] are adopted to select the better 
chromosomes for the subsequent crossover operation. The 
roulette wheel scheme assigns offspring to each parent 
chromosome based on a selection probability in direct 
proportion to its cost value. The basic problem with this 
approach is that an extensively dynamic range of cost may 
result in premature convergence due to the early domination of 
extraordinary chromosomes in the finite population [11]. On 
the other hand, ranking-based scheme is a non-proportional 
selection algorithm which reduces the susceptibility to 
premature convergence. Each parent chromosome is assigned 
an expected number of offspring based on the rank of its 
performance rather than its proportional magnitude. The 
ranking-based selection is performed as follows: 
(i) Firstly, the PN  chromosomes are sorted according to their 
cost values to determine their ranking in the population, 
that is, the best one (with least cost) is ranked in the first 
place. 
(ii) The chromosome ranked in the p-th place is assigned the 
below probability for producing offspring:

E. Crossover 
A crossover mask is utilized to exchange the genes of 
chromosomes. The crossover mask is a vector having a length 
equal to that of the chromosome, consisting of randomly 
generated 1s and 0s. The genes of the selected pair of parents 
are exchanged at locations corresponding to a 1 in the 
crossover mask and the rest of the genes remain the same 
during the crossover. 
F. Mutation 
In this work, the mutation rate for CIR estimation is 
higher than the data estimation because the former has a larger 
solution space. In order to mutate at least one gene of each 
user, the mutation rate is set to 1/ J  for CIR estimation, where 
J  is the number of significant paths. To mutate real-coded 
CIR gene, the randomly selected mutation point is added a 
random complex number c, as illustrated in eq. (11), where A 
and 'A  represent, respectively, the gene before and after 
mutation.

G. Elitist Replacement 
Mutation and crossover are the operations that modify 
genes within combinations. To avoid destroying the good 
solutions during mutation and crossover, a small portion of 
offspring population should be replaced with the good 
chromosomes in the parent population. This is called the elitist 
replacement. In this paper, the elitist replacement is achieved 
by selecting the best chromosomes from the combination of the 
parent and offspring populations.

among the best ( 4BER=1.3 10−× ), which achieves significant 
BER improvements of 96% , 90% , 84% , and 56% , 
respectively, as compared to MRC ( 3BER=3.9 10−× ), GA 
(Roulette Wheel) ( 4BER=1.3 10−× ), GA (Ranking) 
( 4BER=8.6 10−× ), and SAM-GA( 4BER=3 10−× ).

Figure 9 presents the relationship between MSE and 
evolution of five schemes where 4N =  and SNR 12 dB= . As 
seen from Fig. 9, GA (Ranking), SAM-GA and Modified 
SAM-GA require generations of 105, 70, and 40 for achieving 
MSE baseline of 24 10−× . As compared to GA (Ranking), the 
SAM-GA and Modified SAM-GA respectively save 35 and 65 
generations, indicating that SA-based mutation is helpful in 
improving GA convergence rate.
