二、英文摘要 (Abstract) 
The Lacey Mixing Index was used to 
explore the segregation patterns in the interior 
and at the surface of the granular bed. The large 
particles are of the mean size 0.775 mm and the 
small particles are of the mean size 0.505 mm, 
0.460 mm, 0.385 mm, 0.324 mm, 0.274 mm or 
0.230 mm. The binary glass beads with two 
different sizes were mixed in a cylindrical drum 
rotating at 10 rpm and 50% volume fill level. 
The results show that the Lacey Mixing Index 
calculated at the bed surface sharply decreases 
with the increasing of the particle size ratio from 
1.42 to 2.01, reaches a minimum value at 2.01 
and gradually decreases when the particle size 
ratio increases from 2.01 to 3.37. The internal 
segregation patterns reveal that the size of the 
segregation core decreases with the increasing of 
the bed depth and the Lacey Mixing Index at 
different depth contains the same tendency at any 
size ratio.

1. Introduction 
In industry, the rotating drum is a 
commonly used apparatus for particulate 
material transportation, mixing, drying, etc. 
When the granular mixture with different 
physical properties (such as size, density, or 
surface roughness) is mixed in a rotating drum, 
the mixture tends to segregate according to the 
physical properties of the mixture’s components. 
When the binary mixture of different sizes were 
mixed, the high concentration of smaller 
particles would rapidly collect at the axis center, 
and surround by larger particles, which called 
“core”, after several revolutions (Hill et al., 
2005). Following the formation of the segregated 
core, the surface of the particles bed showed the 
alternative high concentration of larger particle 
band and smaller particle band in the axial 
direction (Hill et al., 1997). 
To explore the segregation patterns within 
the bed, Wightman et al. (1996) used a binder 
mixture, including alcohol, octytacrylamide, 
water, acrylates, and butylaminomethacrylate 
copolymer, to “freeze” the glass beads bed. 
Santomaso et al. (2004) used the paraffin wax to 
solidify the segregated soft and fragile 
tetracetylendiamine particle bed. However, the 
frozen structure using the binder mixture resin or 
wax was too hard to slice the bed easily.

Fig. 1 The segregation patterns at different size ratios r and bed depths. The number in the position 
column indicates the position of the observation plane, e.g., 0.5 means 0.5 cm below the bed surface. 
 
Savage (1993) proposed a diffusion model 
to describe particle motion in the axial direction 
in the drum. At the bed surface, Particle motion 
was dominated by the drift current and the drift 
coefficient was a function of the difference of the 
dynamic angles of repose between the large and 
the small particles. The difference of the 
dynamic angles of repose increases with the 
increasing of the particle size ratio. Hence the 
drift current is enhanced with the increasing of 
the particle size ratio and the degree of mixing 
decreases. When the size ratio is larger than 2.01, 
the difference of the dynamic angles of repose is 
too large to increase the possibilities of the 
large-black particles at the bed surface randomly 
falling into the small-white particle bands. Due 
to the existence of the following layer at the bed 
surface and the regular circulation motion, a 
similar Lacey Mixing Index trend was found in 
the bed close to the periphery of the drum (i.e., 4 
cm below the bed surface).
