II. TRANSFORMATION OF FEATURE COORDINATE SYSTEM 
To machine features in the tilted plane, a feature coordinate 
system connected to the tilted plane must be established, as 
shown in Fig. 3. The G68.2 command in the FAUNC 
advanced controller enables the programming coordinate 
system to switch to a feature coordinate system. This study 
uses three points definition and proposes a methodology to 
transform a 3-axis tool path to any tilted plane, facilitating its 
implementation in the cheaper lower hand controller. To 
establish the relative relationship between the feature 
coordinate system and the workpiece coordinate system, a 
homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix is 
introduced.

3 3 3 3(X ,Y ,Z ) P  located in the tilted plane. 1P  is the origin of the 
feature coordinate system. The X axis of the feature 
coordinate system, x y z(a ,a ,a )a , is defined as passing 
through
1P  and 2P . The normal direction of the tilted 
plane, (n ,n ,n )x y zn , can be obtained as follows:

Consequently, the Y axis of the feature coordinate system, 
x y z(b , b , b )b  , can be calculated using the right hand rule from 
the known X and Z directions:

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND VERIFICATION 
A. Software implementation 
The proposed methodology was implemented in a 
Windows-XP environment using the Borland C++ Builder 
programming language and the OpenGL graphics library. 
Tool path for machining the text in the plane (Fig. 8) using the 
CAM module of the UG NX CAD/CAM system  is used to be 
transformed to the tilted plane. Table I lists the examples of 
the generated  NC data for machining of the text. 
Next, the definition by three point was used to transform 
the CL data in the feature coordinate system to the workpiece 
coordinate system. Fig. 9 illustrates the coordinates of three 
vertices located in the tilted plane are  (165,0,0), (0,140,0) 
and (0,0,75), respectively. The execution dialogue of the 
developed transformation system is shown in Fig. 10. It is 
worth mentioning that the first vertex (
1P ) of the three 
vertices is the origin of the feature coordinate system and the 
vector from 
1P  to 2P  forms the X axis of the feature 
coordinate system. The transformed NC data can be obtained 
by inputting the offset vector 30 60 0i j k  and the effective 
tool length (79.985) as shown in Fig. 10(b). Similarly, the 
other two vertices (0,140,0) and (0,0,75) can also be set as the 
origin of the feature coordinate system and the corresponding 
NC data can be easily obtained by the developed 
transformation system.

 Five-axis machining, an  important processes in precision manufacturing, has been used in 
defense, aerospace and consumer product industries. Many combinations can be synthesized to 
generate various five-axis machine tool configurations, in which the linear and rotary axes are 
normally orthogonal. Since five-axis NC data can only be applied to a specific configuration, the 
portability of the NC data is inevitably limited. A special purpose five-axis machine with a 
nonorthogonal linear axis configuration is investigated in this research. The complete analytical 
equations for NC data are obtained using the homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix and 
inverse kinematics. A window-based postprocessor system written by Borland C++ Builder was 
developed according to the proposed algorithm. A roller gear cam was adopted as an example to 
generate the NC code using the proposed postprocessor system. A trail-cut experiment conducted 
with this special purpose machine tool confirms the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Five-axis machining, an advanced technology developed to meet the industrial demands for 
geometric variety and high precision, can provide two additional rotational degrees of freedom and a 
line cutting mode with flank milling by tilting the cutting tool axis. Compared with the point cutting 
mode, the line cutting mode increases the cutting efficiency markedly and is extremely important in 
manufacturing processes. Therefore, it has many industrial applications, such as in automotive, 
aeronautic, and naval industries, manufacturing wooden furniture and laser-beam machining [1-2]. 
Many combinations can be synthesized to generate various five-axis machine tool configurations 
in which the linear and rotary axes are normally orthogonal. A five-axis machine with a 
nonorthogonal linear axes configuration is investigated in this research. This configuration is a special 
purpose five-axis machine tool which is used to manufacture precision mechanical components such 
as index tables and roller gear indexing drives. A special purpose five-axis machine tool facilitates the 
convenient and rapid mass production of products with specific functions, even though the machining 
center is only dedicated to a particular product. 
Programming multi-axis machining is more difficult than that for three-axis machining because of 
the varying orientation of the cutter relative to the workpiece during machining. To generate the 
five-axis NC program, the interface, known as the postprocessor capable of converting the cutter 
location (CL) data created by CAM systems into the machine control data, should be utilized. 
Postprocessors are machine dependent since different machine tools may have different controllers 
and configurations. Consequently, a manufacturing system with various machine tools requires 
several postprocessors. Notably, a postprocessor can be developed using the graphical method [3], 
homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix [4], or numerical method [5]. However, recent 
studies apply postprocessor schemes for five-axis machine tools with orthogonal linear or rotary axes. 
Relatively fewer studies [6] have addressed the nonorthogonal linear axis configuration. 
In this work, a postprocessor system dedicated to the proposed special configuration is developed 
to transform the CL data into machine control data through homogeneous coordinate transformation

 The structural elements of the machine tool are an  rotary table, machine bed,  linear table,  
linear table, rotary axis, linear table, and cutting tool. The relative position and orientation of the 
cutting tool with respect to the workpiece can be determined sequentially starting from the workpiece 
and ending at the cutting tool and is referred to as the form-shaping function [8]. The form-shaping 
function of this machine tool can be expressed mathematically in the following matrix form:

respectively; and φ  and φ  are the rotation angles for the -axis and the -axis, respectively. 
Positive rotation is in the direction of an advancing right-hand screw about the + and + axes. 
Equation (1) specifies the form-shaping function matrix of this machine tool, and joint parameters xP , 
yP , zP , φ  and φ  should be determined by inverse kinematics.

To confirm the feasibility of the proposed methodology, a window-based postprocessor system was 
developed under the Windows-XP environment in Borland C++ Builder programming language. 
When parameters : 0=30α ,  =140  mm,  r=12.5  mm, 12=  mm, δ=41 mm and the timing chart 
for the globoidal cam 2φ  versus turret 3φ  are known, the CL data can be acquired by Eq. (9). 
Therefore, the NC data for machining roller gear cam can be generated by the developed 
postprocessor system and CL data. The generated five-axis NC data are further verified by performing 
an experimental trial-cut with the special purpose five-axis machine tool. Figure 5 shows the finished 
roller gear cam with model material, indicating that the proposed scheme can be applied for practical 
five-axis machining.

A postprocessor methodology for the five-axis machine tool with nonorthogonal linear axis 
configuration was developed. The complete analytical equations of NC data were determined by the 
homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix, and the forward and inverse kinematics. Although 
the proposed machine tool is a special purpose configuration, the proposed postprocessor system can 
convert the CL data generated by various commercial CAD/CAM systems into NC data. Therefore, 
the dedicated machine tool can manufacture various products flexibly, and create considerable added 
value, and enhance industrial competitiveness.
