 While a two-way asymmetric-plan building pushed by using its modal inertia force vector, 
there are two base shears versus two roof translations and one base torque versus one roof 
rotation relationships simultaneously available (Lin and Tsai 2008). It has been confirmed 
that the stated three force-deformation curves presented in the acceleration-displacement-
response-spectra (ADRS) format overlap when the original building is elastic. However, 
these three pushover curves are very likely bifurcated when the original building becomes 
inelastic. This bifurcation is due to the non-proportionality between roof translations and roof 
rotation, which is a rather common physical phenomenon for inelastic asymmetric-plan 
building systems. Obviously, the SDOF modal system is only capable of describing one of 
the three force-deformation relationships. Thus, when the conventional inelastic response 
spectrum constructed from the SDOF modal systems is used to predict the seismic responses 
of an inelastic multi-story two-way asymmetric-plan structure, there would be no available 
information about the responses in the other two directions. Or otherwise, the responses in 
the other two directions may be inappropriately estimated if the same inelastic response 
spectrum is utilized. It is obvious that the more difference between these three pushover cures, 
the more errors in the prediction of the responses in the other two directions using the same 
response spectrum. Furthermore, the peak responses shown in the conventional inelastic 
response spectra are obtained without considering the translation-rotation interaction effects. 
The existence of the translation-rotation interaction effects in each vibration mode of 
asymmetric-plan structures will be demonstrated in the study. On the other aspect, the 
conventional inelastic response spectra are only applicable to structures under the excitation 
of one-component of ground motions. These issues in the application of the conventional 
inelastic response spectra arises from the fact that SDOF modal systems are incapable of 
simultaneously describing the three force-deformation relationships in each “vibration mode” 
of an inelastic two-way asymmetric-plan building.  
In order to simultaneously describe the three force-deformation relationships of the 
original multi-story two-way asymmetric-plan building when it is pushed by using its modal 
inertia force vector, the three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) modal system has been developed 
(Lin and Tsai 2008). The stated three force-deformation relationships are two roof 
translations versus two roof rotations relationships and one roof rotation versus one base 
torque relationship. It has been demonstrated that the elastic 3DOF modal system itself 
exhibits only one vibration mode, and the other two vibration modes are spurious, i.e. no any 
effect to its elastic dynamic responses. Thus, the elastic 3DOF modal system actually 
represents one single vibration mode of an elastic multi-story two-way asymmetric-plan 
building. Furthermore, the properly constructed inelastic 3DOF modal system can 
satisfactorily describe the bifurcation phenomenon observed in the pushover curves of the 
original multi-story two-way asymmetric-plan building when it is pushed by using its modal 
inertia force vector. 
With the aim dealing with the aforementioned issues arising from using the conventional 
inelastic response spectra, the objective of this study is to develop a new type of inelastic 
response spectra constructed from the 3DOF modal systems. It will be demonstrated that 
such a new type of inelastic response spectra can effectively predict the peak responses in the 
three directions for each vibration mode of the multi-story two-way asymmetric-plan 
buildings under the bi-directional ground excitations. In order to construct the new type of 
inelastic response spectra for asymmetrical structures (referred to as SAS hereafter), three 
prerequisite key tasks are completed. These three key tasks are 1) the identification of the 
independent elastic 3DOF modal parameters, 2) the establishment of the relationships

Equations 5b and 5c indicate that the xn and zn can be regarded as the ratios of the 
earthquake load resulting from the n-th vibration mode subjected to a single directional 
ground excitation to that being subjected to the bi-directional ground excitation when  tugx is 
the same as  tugz . The xn and zn are referred to as the n-th modal excitation ratios in the X- 
and Z-directions, respectively.  is a scaling factor. When the peak 3DOF modal responses 
are presented in terms of the corresponding peak elastic responses,  vanishes and only xn 
and zn remain as the parameters required for the specification of bidirectional ground 
excitations.  
PARAMETRIC STUDY 
The inelastic response spectra for two-way asymmetric-plan buildings can be constructed 
by using the 3DOF modal systems if the values of exn, |exn|/rxn, xn,zn, xn, zn, n, R, xn, 
zn and the damping ratio n are given. The ranges of the values of strength ratio, R, and 
damping ratio, n, have been widely studied. However, the ranges of the values of exn, |exn|/rxn, 
xn,zn, xn, zn, n, xn and zn are not clear. The study of the conventional response 
spectra only became meaningful after the ranges of the associated parameter values were well 
understood. Therefore, the goal of this section is to study the ranges of the values of exn, 
|exn|/rxn, xn,zn, xn, zn, n, xn and zn. Since parametric studies on elastic one-story 
asymmetric-plan buildings have been extensively conducted in the past, the ranges of the 
whole-structure parameter values for one-story systems are already available. In order to 
know the common values of the mentioned 3DOF modal parameters, their variations with 
respect to the changes of the whole-structure parameters for one-story asymmetric-plan 
buildings are investigated as follows. Figure 1 illustrates the variation of the values of the 
first modal eccentricities, i.e. ex1, ez1, of the one-story systems with an aspect ratio  equal to 
0.5. In the figure, there are nine 3-dimensional plots representing the nine combinations of 
x and z. The two abscissa of each plot are the values of xe and ze  ranging from -0.5 to 
0.5. In general, the surfaces representing the values of ex1 and ez1 look like concave or convex 
domes. Figure 1a shows the values of ex1 are always larger than -1. In addition, Fig. 1b shows 
the values of ez1 are always less than 1. Figure 1 evidently shows that the values of ex1 and ez1 
increase as the frequency ratio z increases. On the other hand, the values of ex1 and ez1 
decrease as the frequency ratio x increases. Figure 1 also shows that the variation for the 
values of ex1 and ez1 is more sensitive to the change of the normalized eccentricity ēz than to 
the change of ēx. Since the values of ex1 and ez1 are negative and positive, respectively (Figs. 
1a and 1b), it clearly indicates that the first modal vibration period of a one-story system is

SELECTED MODAL PARAMETER VALUES AND GROUND MOTION 
RECORDS 
To sum up, there are 50 values of Tn, 3 values of xn , 3 values of zn , 2 values of 
|exn|/rxn , 2 values of exn , 2 values of xn , 2 values of R , 3 cases of the combinations of xn, 
zn and n when exn = -0.75, and 6 cases of the combinations of xn, zn and n when exn = 6. 
Therefore, there are a total of 32400 (=5033222(3+6)) 3DOF modal systems have 
been considered in this study. Applying 40 pairs of ground motion records, it requires 
1296000 (=3240040) times of nonlinear response history analyses. 
SPECTRA FOR ASYMMETRIC STRUCTURES 
To Figure 2 shows the mean ductility response spectra for the strength ratio equal to 3 
and 6. Moreover, the mean values plus one standard deviation are also shown in Fig. 2. It is 
obvious that the ductility values approach the strength values when the vibration period is 
very large, which is the same as that observed in the conventional response spectra. Figure 2 
shows that the three components of the mean ductility demands for R = 3 are close, i.e. 
nznxn   . Nevertheless, xn, zn and n are quite different for R = 6. This implies that 
the conventional response spectra gradually become inadequate as the strength ratio increases. 
That is, it is insufficient to use a SDOF modal system for estimating the three different modal 
ductility demands of a substantially inelastic asymmetric-plan building. From the mean value 
plus one standard deviation (Fig. 2), it shows that the dispersion of the ductility demands as R 
= 6 is larger than that of R = 3. In short, the ductility demand as R = 6 is more sensitive to the 
variation of the 3DOF modal parameter values than the ductility demands as R = 3 are. 
Figure 2 also shows that the deviation of zn is significantly larger than those of xn and n. 
This is because there are four selected values of zn widely ranging from -0.2 to 0.35. 
However, there are only one and two selected values of xn (=0.05) and n (=0.08 and 0.3), 
respectively.

二、 與會心得 
(1) Bled4 Workshop: Performance Based Seismic Engineering- Vision for an 
Earthquake Resilient Society 
繼 Bled 1 (1992)、 Bled 2 (1997)、 Bled 3 (2004) ，此次是第四屆 Bled 
Workshop。 除了表彰 Bled Workshop的創始者—Professors Fajfar與 Krawinkler—
在地震工程上的貢獻外，此次研討會的目的是討論與建立地震工程全球性的願景，
並在近二十年來推展性能設計法後，討論新的想法與未來的趨勢，目標是發展出
合適的策略，以增進社區(會)在地震作用下的回復性(resilience)。 
「回復性」已愈來愈受到重視與討論。所謂回復性是指一個社區(會)或是一
個建物在非常態的事件下，例如地震力作用下，喪失全部或部份的使用功能後，
為了恢復事件前原有的使用功能，所須要投入的修復成本，修復成本愈低，即回
復性愈高，反之亦然。所謂修復成本是取決於標的物在事件當下的立即損壞程度、
所需要的修復時間、金錢以及在修復過程中因為部份的使用功能喪失所增加的社
會支出。明顯地，在以建立高回復性的社區(會)為目標時，亦即期望降低地震對
於社區(會)所產生的衝擊，地震工程所面臨的挑戰是從傳統只考量建物本身，擴
大為考量一整個系統，其中包含了建物所須提供的功能；另一個挑戰是從傳統只

論文，現正申請我國及大陸專利中。發展新式的隔減震裝置是目前地震工程的熱
門課題之一，職利用此次研討會有效地推廣本中心的研發成果，並與其他與會者

其結構變形主要為撓曲變形的特性，發展出外掛式的阻尼器；亦有以鋼索(wire 
rope)製成遲滯型的調諧質量阻尼器(TMD)，利用鋼索的撓曲變形達到消能的目的，
因為一般觀念認為 TMD必須保持在線性範圍內，以避免離頻(detuning)後降低減

ABSTRACT: This paper proposes bi-directional coupled tuned mass dampers (BiCTMDs) for the seismic response control of 
two-way asymmetric-plan buildings subjected to bi-directional ground motions. The proposed BiCTMD was developed from the 
three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) modal system, which represents the vibration mode of a two-way asymmetric-plan building. 
The performance of the proposed BiCTMD for the seismic response control of elastic two-way asymmetric-plan buildings was 
verified by investigating the reductions of the amplitudes of the associated frequency response functions. In addition, the 
investigation showed that the proposed BiCTMD is effective in reducing the seismic damage of inelastic asymmetric-plan 
buildings. Therefore, the BiCTMD is an effective approach for the seismic response control of both elastic and inelastic two-
way asymmetric-plan buildings. 
KEY WORDS: Tuned mass dampers; Asymmetric-plan buildings; Modal control. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Tuned mass dampers (TMDs) are commonly recognized as 
an effective approach for reducing the seismic responses of 
elastic buildings [1 － 3]. Moreover, Rana and Soong [4] 
showed that a TMD can be effectively designed for 
controlling the selected vibration mode of an elastic multi-
story symmetrical building. Due to the modal contamination 
problem, the multiple TMD (MTMD) is not recommended for 
the simultaneous control of several vibration modes of an 
elastic multi-story building [4]. At the same time, the 
performance of elastic TMDs for displacement control is not 
as good for inelastic buildings as it is for elastic buildings due 
to the de-tuning effect when the building yields [5 － 7]. 
Although the reductions in the displacement responses of 
inelastic buildings caused by using elastic TMDs are not 
significant, some researchers have confirmed that the 
hysteretic energy demand of symmetrical buildings can be 
significantly reduced by using elastic TMDs [6－8]. Thus, 
generally speaking, elastic TMDs are effective for the seismic 
response control of both elastic and inelastic symmetrical 
buildings. 
In fact, due to their architectural and functional 
requirements, most real buildings are plan-asymmetric. 
Keeping in mind that the vibration modes of asymmetric 
buildings are translation-rotation coupled, using a single 
translation-only TMD is therefore not a very effective 
approach for the modal control of asymmetric-plan buildings. 
In order to control the coupled vibration of asymmetric-plan 
buildings by using conventional TMDs, the typical approach 
is to adopt the MTMD [9－11]. Compared with the design of 
a single TMD, the design of the MTMD is potentially much 
more complicated for a practicing engineer. For example, 
there are additional parameters, such as the number of TMDs, 
the spacing between the TMDs, the frequency ranges of the 
TMDs, the eccentricity between the TMDs and the building, 
and others. All of these parameters must be optimized when 
the MTMD is selected to control an asymmetric-plan building. 
In order to simplify these complications, a single coupled 
TMD (CTMD) was developed that vibrates simultaneously in 
both translation and rotation, consistent with the targeted 
coupled vibration mode of a one-way asymmetric-plan 
building [12]. Nevertheless, the most realistic type of building 
is the two-way asymmetric-plan building subjected to bi-
directional ground motions. If the MTMD is used to control 
the seismic responses of a two-way asymmetric-plan building, 
it is inevitable that a set of MTMDs in each horizontal 
direction must be used. In addition, the interaction between 
those two sets of MTMDs through the coupled vibration 
should be considered, thereby further increasing the 
complications in the design and construction of the MTMD. 
Encouraged by the performance of the CTMD in the seismic 
response of elastic one-way asymmetric-plan buildings, we 
investigated the bi-directional CTMD, hereafter referred to as 
BiCTMD in this paper, as an approach for the modal control 
of two-way asymmetric-plan buildings subjected to bi-
directional ground motions. The BiCTMD can simultaneously 
translate in the two horizontal directions as well as rotate in 
the floor plan. The effectiveness of the proposed BiCTMD for 
both elastic and inelastic two-way asymmetric-plan buildings 
was investigated. 
2 PROPERTIES OF THE BICTMD 
The two horizontal axes of the coordinate system used in 
this paper are the X- and the Z-axes. The direction of the Y-
axis is opposite to the direction of gravity. The subscripts x, z 
and θ used in the following equations represent the associated 
quantities related to the X- and Z-translational and Y-
rotational components, respectively. When the BiCTMD is 
used to control the three-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) model

Buildings under Bi-Directional Ground Excitations

shape in the translational and rotational directions, 
respectively. Compared with Eq. 2, the added superscript s 
shown in Eq. 6 denotes that the associated quantities are for 
controlling the actual N-storey building rather than for 
controlling the 3DOF modal system considered in the 
conceptual modal level. The justification of the properties of 
the BiCTMD (Eq. 6) is shown in Lin et al. [14]. 
3 VALIDATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 
BICTMD 
It was confirmed in the previous study [12] that the 
proposed concept of translation-rotation coupled tuned mass 
dampers is effective for three types of one-way asymmetric-
plan buildings: torsionally-stiff, torsionally-similarly-stiff and 
torsionally-flexible. The buildings investigated were 
variations of the 8-story building used in other research [11]. 
The primary variations in those 8-story example buildings 
were the eccentricity ratio, increased by up to 25%, and the 
mass moment of inertia for each story, which varied by one-
third, one and five times that of the original 8-story building. 
Thus, in the present study, a 20-story two-way asymmetric-
plan building, which is a taller and much more complicated 
torsionally-similarly-stiff type of structure, is chosen. This is 
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BiCTMD for 
the modal control of high-rise two-way asymmetric-plan 
buildings. 
3.1 The example building and selected ground motion 
records 
The example building used in the study is a variation of the 
20-story symmetric-plan building used in the SAC steel 
research project for the investigation of buildings located in 
Los Angeles [15]. Each floor of the example building is 
simulated as a rigid diaphragm. The center of rigidity (CR) is 
at the geometric center of the floor plan. The chosen variation 
is the center of mass (CM) of the 20-story symmetric-plan 
building being moved away from the CR to give eccentricity 
ratios equal to 20% in both the  X- and Z-directions (Fig. 1b). 
Furthermore, because highly coupled asymmetric-plan 
buildings are much more difficult to control compared to 
torsionally-stiff asymmetric-plan buildings, the value of mass 
moment of inertia of each floor is enlarged to three times the 
value of the original symmetrical building. The properties of 
the first three vibration modes of the example building and 
those of the corresponding uncoupled building are shown in 
Table 1. Table 1 implies that the frequency ratios of the 
example building, which are defined as the ratio of the 
rotational frequency to the translational frequency of the 
corresponding uncoupled building, are equal to 1.09 and 0.98 
in the X- and Z-directions, respectively. Thus, the intended 
increase in the mass moment of inertia produces the example 
building, which is highly coupled in the three directions, i.e. 
X- and Z-translations and Y-rotation. The materials of the 
beams and columns used in the 20-storey building are Dual 
A36 Gr. 50 steel and A572 Gr. 50 steel, respectively. The 
yield strength of these two steel types used in the analysis is 
340 MPa and 345 MPa, respectively. The details of the size of 
the members and the mass distribution of the 20-story 
building can be found in the original report [15]. Stiffness-
proportional damping with the first mode damping ratio equal 
to 0.02 is assumed. In addition to the example building with a 
BiCTMD placed on the roof, the example building without 
any dampers was also analyzed. The mass ratio μ was chosen 
as 0.05. From other research results [3], the optimum values 
of f0n and ξan are equal to 0.9636 and 0.1366, respectively, for 
the conventional TMD as ξn = 0.02 and μ = 0.05. Thus, from 
Eq. 5, the optimum values of f and β for the BiCTMD were 
found to be equal to 0.046 and 0.329, respectively. The 
seismic responses of the example building with and without 
BiCTMDs were obtained using the step-by-step numerical 
integration procedure. 
The two components of the ground motion recorded for the 
1940 El Centro earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake, denoted as LA03/LA04 and LA23/LA24, 
respectively, in the SAC steel research project [15], were used 
in this study.  The peak ground accelerations of these scaled 
ground motion records are 0.39g/0.49g for LA03/LA04 and 
0.42g/0.47g for LA23/LA24. Other properties of these ground 
motion records can be found in the associated report [15]. In 
the elastic analyses, the materials of the example building and 
the BiCTMD were assumed to be elastic. In the inelastic 
analyses, the materials of the example building were assumed 
to be bilinear with a post-yielding stiffness ratio equal to 0.03 
and the BiCTMD remaining elastic. 
3.2 Elastic seismic responses of the example building 
The frequency response functions, which are general 
transfer functions and are independent of the characteristics of 
the ground motion records, were used to investigate the 
effectiveness of the proposed BiCTMD for the elastic seismic 
response control of the example building. The amplitudes of 
the roof translational and rotational frequency response 
functions, respectively denoted as Hx, Hz and Hθ, of the 
example building without the BiCTMD are shown in Fig. 2. 
Recognizing from Fig. 2 that the 2nd vibration mode makes a 
substantial contribution to the roof X- and Z-translations as 
well as the roof rotation, the BiCTMD was designed to control 
the 2nd vibration mode of the example building. The properties 
of the BiCTMD computed from Eq. 6 are shown in Table 2. 
The amplitudes of the three frequency response functions, Hx, 
Hz and Hθ, of the example building with the BiCTMD are also 
shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2 indicates that the amplitudes of Hx, 
Hz and Hθ for the example building with the BiCTMD are 
substantially reduced compared with those for the example 
building without a damper. Thus, the effectiveness of the 
proposed BiCTMD for simultaneously reducing the X- and Z-
translational and the rotational seismic responses of the elastic 
two-way asymmetric-plan example building was validated. 
In order to perform response history analyses for structures 
with BiCTMDs using a commercial structural analysis 
program, the analytical model of the proposed BiCTMD (Eq. 
6) must be accurately constructed and added to the whole 
structural finite element model. For the sake of simplifying 
the notation, the mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the 
BiCTMD (Eq. 6) are expressed as:

3.3 Inelastic seismic responses of the example building 
In order to neutralize the influence of the directionality of 
the input ground motions, the two components of each pair of 
the selected ground motion records were interchanged to 
apply in the X- and Z-directions, respectively. Furthermore, 
the Z-directional ground motion records, multiplied by 1 and -
1, were considered. Thus, there were four combinations for 
each selected pair of ground motion records used in the 
inelastic analyses. The mean energy demands of the example 
building with and without the BiCTMD under the excitations 
of the four combinations of each pair of selected ground 
motion records are shown in Fig. 7. The notations EI, ED, and
