The poling direction of Eq. (2) is on the 
positive z-direction. It should be noted that the 
form of Eq. (2) is different from that in ANSYS. 
The transformation of the material constants is 
necessary for ANSYS. 
Fig. 1 shows the finite piezoelectric plate 
with a central crack in this study. The plate is 
subjected to electro-mechanical loads, i.e. the 
tensile stress σ0 and electric displacement D0. 
The electrical load D0 can be replaced by an 
equivalent voltage difference ∆V between upper 
and lower surfaces of the plate.  
The software ANSYS [7] is used to 
calculate the finite element results. When the 
plate dimensions 2W and 2L are very larger than 
the crack length 2a, it can be considered as an 
infinite plane problem. Thus, the intensity 
factors obtained from Kuna’s method and finite 
element results can be verified by the analytical 
solutions as follows [3]: 
 
aKI πσ 0=    (4)   
aDKIV π0=    (5)  
 
where KI and KIV are the mode-I stress intensity 
factor and electric displacement intensity factor, 
respectively. Eq. (4) and (5) are derived from 
the assumption of the impermeable crack [3], i.e. 
the electric displacement vector can not pass 
through the crack. Also, it should be noted that 
the intensity factors in Eq. (4) and (5) are 
uncoupled.

3. Kuna's method  
 
Using the quarter-point elements (QPE) 
[10], Kuna [5-6] has developed the formulas to 
obtain the stress intensity factor and electric 
displacement intensity factor at the crack tip 
from the finite element results. The formulas are

where i=1,2,3 for the coefficient a1i. ui and φ in 
terms of (r,θ) are the displacement and electric 
potential at different locations of nodes. In Eq. 
(6), ui(r,θ) and φ(r,θ) denote the values at the 
node A, B, C, A’, B’, and C’ in Fig. 2. Node A 
and A’ are the same node at the crack tip.  
As shown in Fig. 2, θ = π and −π express 
the upper and lower crack faces, respectively. 
The term l is the length of the quarter-point 
element. KI, KII and KIII are the stress intensity 
sym.

In addition, Table 3 shows the finite 
element results of KI and KIV under pure 
mechanical loading and pure electrical loading, 
respectively. It shows that KI and KIV are 
coupled. For example, the value of KIV should 
be zero when D0=0, but the result is not. This 
numerical phenomenon violates the analytical 
solutions in Eqs. (4) and (5). This error may be 
induced from the finite element mesh and will 
be discussed in the next section. 
 
4.3 Effects of finite element mesh around the 
crack tip 
 
In this section, the local finite element 
mesh around the crack tip is modified to 
investigate the errors. Fig. 7 shows different 
types of mesh for the problem. The loadings of 
models in Fig. 7 are σ0=1×106 Pa and D0=0 
C/m2. In these cases, KIV should be zero 
according to the analytical solution in Eq. (5). 
From the numerical results in Table 4, KIV still 
has non-zero value and it decreases when the 
mesh is refined.  
We can speculate that KIV will be zero 
when the mesh around the crack tip is refined 
enough. But too fine mesh of QPE may cause 
the element distortion problem and errors. This 
is the key issue of this problem and it needs to 
be solved in the future.

3 Results and Discussions 
3.1 Slope continuity criterion 
In this study, the definition of the rotating angle of 
the cracked structure is based on the beam the-
ory. From the plane strain finite element results, 
the rotating angle is defined by deflections of ad-
jacent nodes along the neutral plane where the 
crack tip also lies on.  
In Fig. 4, it shows the rotating angles of the un-
cracked and cracked structure with the piezo-
electric actuator and Va=0 V. The existence of 
the crack makes a serious discontinuity in the 
rotating angle curve. In the slope continuity crite-
rion, this discontinuity is expected to be can-
celled by the piezoelectric actuator with the re-
pair voltage Var.

Fig. 5 Variations of rotating angles with various 
applied voltages      
 
For the active repair, Fig. 5 shows the rotating 
angle curves with various applied voltages. Even 
in the case of higher voltage Va=500 V, the dis-
continuity still can not be cancelled by the piezo-
electric actuator but the crack actually closes 
partially. Fig. 6 shows the deformation of the 
case Va= 500 V from the finite element analysis. 
The crack mouth is closed but the crack tip area 
is still open so that the discontinuity can not be 
cancelled.  
According to above results, it is difficult to deter-
mine the repair voltage Var by the slope continu-
