2orifice geometry, and fluid viscosity on damper behavior. Because the theory identifies that the
velocity power exponent of Eq. (1) is not a constant, a new model in the similitude of Eq. (1) is
proposed to precisely capture damper behavior at the cost of one additional damper parameter.
Force Equilibrium Equations for Fluid Dampers with an Annular Orifice
Based on the fundamental theory of fluid mechanics, Hou [6] developed the equations for the
dampers with a simple annular orifice. For the force equilibrium, the forces acting on a fluid
element flowing in the orifice must satisfy the following equation:
yx
p
t
u





  (2)
where y is the location coordinate along the radial direction of the damper, u is the flow velocity of
the element and thus u = u(y, t) and
t
u

 is the inertia force;
x
p



gradient along the direction of piston head width,is the shear stress acting on the element face.
Hou verified that fluid inertia is not important and can be neglected for the annular-orifice dampers
used in building or bridge structures. For the incompressible fluid,
x
p


can be assumed to be
linear and written as p/L (p = pressure difference on the both sides of the piston head, and L =
piston head width). Integrate both sides of Eq. (2) respect to y with the proper boundary
condition(h/2) = 0:
(y, t)= )

where h is the orifice width. It is important to note that the above equation is simply derived from
force equilibrium condition without considering the filled fluid properties. In other words, for
dampers filled with any type of fluid operated under the boundary condition (h/2) = 0, the above
equation must be satisfied as long as the fluid inertia is not important.
Rheology of the Filled Fluid
To solve the viscous fluid flow problem in dampers, the filled fluid properties must be given,
that is, the shear stress versus shear strain rate (or shear rate) must be known.
For viscous fluid flow, the shear stress acting on the fluid element is proportional to the shear
rate:

(y, t) =(y, t)=
y
tyu

 ),(
(4)
where is the fluid viscosity. If the fluid viscosity is a constant, that is, the fluid is Newtonian,
one can solve the fluid dynamic equations and obtain the damper behavior to be linear theoretically.
Since a damper is usually filled with silicone oil, the rheological properties of silicone oil
should be considered. Silicone oil is a liquid polymer with non-Newtonian rheology, that is, the
viscosity of the fluid is not a constant and becomes thinned when the fluid is subjected to large
shear rate. Figure 2 shows some tested viscosity versus shear rate relationships of silicone oil
reported in literature [7, 8]. In the figure, both the viscosity and shear rate are displayed in
logarithmic values. The tested viscosity curve shows a constant plateau followed by a transition
region and finally decreases with a constant slope. The value of the constant plateau is called the
viscosity of zero shear rate. If there is no subsequent shear thinned behavior at higher shear rate,
the oil is a Newtonian fluid and the damper should have linear behavior. However, the subsequent
4Influences of Frequency on Damper Stiffness
Chen [14] performed tests of scaled dampers and the data are used in this study for further
analyses. The tested damper has an internal diameter of 50 mm for the closed cylinder and the
piston assembly can be replaced with various head diameters: 48.8, 48.9 and 49.1 mm. Each
piston head diameter corresponds to a damper with an annular orifice width of 0.6, 0.55 and 0.45
mm, respectively. The dampers were tested at various frequencies with a peak displacement of 10
mm.
In a sinusoidal displacement cycle, the forces at peak displacements, F+ and F ,ˉ are used to
determine the damper stiffness:
K = (|F+| +| F |ˉ)/(|u+|+|u-|) (8)
where K is the stiffness of the damper, and u+ and u- are the two peak displacements. The force
and displacement records are extracted from Chen’s data and the values of K are determined for
each test frequency. The same procedure is also applied to the analytical solutions. Since the
filled silicone oil has a zero-shear-rate viscosity of 1 Pa·s, the-relationship of Lee [8] (see Fig.
2) is used in the theoretical calculations. Hou [6] used a value of 0.0015 second for2 in Eq. (6).
This value is also adopted in the calculations.
Figure 3 is a plot for the measured and calculated stiffness versus frequency relationships.
In the figure, the test data show the well known behavior that the damper stiffness increases with
increasing frequency. The theoretical solutions also successfully show this trend. When the
relaxation term in Eq. (6) is neglected in the theoretical calculations, it is easy to observe that the
calculated results show no stiffness behavior, indicating that the 2( t / ) term is the cause of
damper stiffness. Higher frequencies imply that fluid element in the orifice is subjected to faster
shear stress variation, i.e., larger2( t / ), as a result, more stiffness effects are caused.
The stiffness versus frequency relationship of the linear dampers can be easily obtained
analytically [2]:

(9)
whereis the radian frequency of the external sinusoidal displacement. As the value of (1)2 is
small compared to 1, K is proportional to 2. When a damper is nonlinear, the stiffness versus
frequency relationship is influenced by the velocity power exponent. This can be explicitly
illustrated by the numerical solutions assuming the fluid rheological properties to be characterized
by a power law relationship, which is also used widely in polymer industry for polymers with shear-
thinning or -thickening behavior:
=||                 (10)
where and are fluid rheological parameters. When Eq. (10) is used in Eq. (6) and the
relaxation term is not considered, the analytical damper behavior from the fluid dynamics equations
is ‘pure’nonlinear with a velocity power exponent: F = C0|V|·sgn(V). In other words, the fluid
rheological parameteris equivalent to the damper parameter n.
If the relaxation term is further considered, the solution shows the ‘pure’nonlinear behavior
with stiffness. Hence, the effects ofvalue, i.e., n value, on the stiffness can be studied. Figure
4 shows a log-log plot for the calculated stiffness versus frequency relationships of variousvalues.
For simplicity, identicalvalue is used for differentvalue calculations without considering that
should be different when value changes for reasonable stiffness results. Hence, the calculated
stiffness is extremely small for= 0.5 when compared to the calculated stiffness of= 1.0. The
6Chen [14] also performed tests of a damper filled with silicone oil of different zero-shear-rate
viscosities. The measured output force F is divided by the recorded maximum F in a displacement
cycle. This normalized force ratio is then plotted against the damper velocity. Figure 8 shows
the results of the 49.1 mm-damper filled with silicone oils of zero-shear-rate viscosity 1 and 0.1
Pa·s. The tested displacement amplitude and frequency were 10 mm and 10 Hz, respectively. It
is obvious that the 1-Pa·s data show a more‘inflation’feature near the zero-velocity region than that
of 0.1 Pa·s, indicating that thicker oil causes more stiffness effects. Similar phenomenon was also
found in Chen’s other experimental data.
Theoretically the stiffness behavior is caused by the relaxation term 2( t / ) in Eq. (6).
Therefore, for different oils, a larger stiffness effect may be caused by larger t / or a larger 2
value. If fluid elements are subjected to identical shear rate, larger shear stress is always caused in
the thicker oil element because of the larger viscosity, implying that larger t / takes place for the
thicker oil subjected to sinusoidal excitations.
The other factor, 2, is also influenced by the oil viscosity. Since the silicone oil is a liquid
polymer, explanation regarding the effects of viscosity on2 requires basic knowledge of polymers
[15, 16]. When a shear strain is applied in a short period and retained on a polymer element, a
corresponding shear stress is caused but starts to decrease due to the fact that oil molecules rotate to
accommodate the shear deformation. As a consequence, the shear stress is relieved and finally
vanished. Relaxation time is a measurement of the time required to relieve the shear stress.
Theoretically different sizes of silicone oil molecules exhibit different2 values. Due to the inertia,
it is uneasy for larger molecules to rotate to accommodate the shear strain. Hence, the value of2
is larger for larger oil molecules. It is well known in polymer industry that molecular weight of
silicone oil is strongly related to the viscosity, that is, the thicker oil is composed by larger
molecules. Hence, for thicker oils the relaxation time is larger.
It is worth noting that the silicone oil with a specific zero-shear-rate viscosity always contains
molecules of various sizes. Since molecules of identical size exhibit the same 2 value, a
relaxation spectrum should be used to describe the relaxation behavior of the oil containing various
molecules of different sizes. However, if the spectrum is considered in Eq. (6), the problem
becomes complicated and the fluid dynamics equations become uneasy to solve. Due to the above
reasons, Hou [6] used a trial-and-error approach to determine the best single value for 2 by
comparing the calculated damper behavior with the test data. Hence, the determined 2 value is a
nominal relaxation parameter for silicone oil. The same approach can be used to determine the
best2 values for the 1- and 0.1-Pa·s silicone oils to estimate the stiffness behavior of dampers filled
with these two oils. However, the obtained 2 values are not the ‘real’relaxation time obtained
from the oil rheological test, and the quantitative discussion of their effects on damper stiffness
becomes meaningless. But a qualitative conclusion can be reached: the 1-Pa·s silicone oil is
thicker and in the oil the molecular sizes are larger than those of the 0.1-Pa·s oil, and the molecules
require longer time to adjust position to release the shear stress. Hence, for two identical dampers
filled with the two oils, the relaxation term in Eq. (6), contributed both from2 and t / , is more
significant for the damper filled with the 1 Pa·s-oil. As a consequence, the 1-Pa·s damper shows a
more significant stiffness behavior.
A Four-Parameter Model for Damper Behavior Considering the Fluid Shear-Thinning Effects
The Model
Although the damper behavior can be explained by the fluid dynamics equations considering
the fluid shear-thinning and viscoelastic behavior, it is observed that discrepancies exist between the
calculated and the tested damper behavior. These discrepancies are mainly due to the errors from
the silicone oil rheology parameters and the damper orifice width. When a full scale damper is
decided to be used in a construction project, the theoretical approach becomes inadequate to
determine the damper parameters, such as C0 and n in Eq. (1). In other words, the damper tests are
inevitable for the determination of damper parameters.
Eq. (1) is simple with only three parameters to be determined. However, its disadvantage is
8When the damper velocity is small, the right side of the two equations exhibit different forms:
one is 1.907V and the other is 5.155V0.711. When the velocity becomes large, the right side of Eq.
(13) can be approximated by 5.729V0.694, which is close to 5.155V0.711. Note that the above
expressions regarding the velocity power exponent is not mathematically serious since there are no
valid values for V0.711 and V0.694 when V < 0.
Figure 9 shows the calculated output forces at maximum velocities using the two regressed
equations without considering the relaxation term. It is found that both results are very close and
adequately describe the measured data.
Equations (13) and (14) are further used to estimate the damper behavior for a full
displacement cycle with the relaxation term considered. In stead of using a mathematical
sinusoidal velocity history in the calculations, the measured damper velocity histories of 1 and 10
Hz are used and Fig. 10 shows the results. In Fig. 10(a), the thick and thin lines are the results of
Eqs. (13) and (14) for the frequency of 1 Hz, respectively. For damper velocity less than 40
mm/sec, both results are close but can be distinguished, and the power exponent equation (Eq. (14))
predicts larger output forces in magnitude. As the velocity becomes larger than 40 mm/sec, two
lines merge together. The thick line shows the approximately linear damper behavior at the low
velocity range and shows the power exponent behavior in the higher velocity range. In Fig. 10(b),
it shows that the 10-Hz results of both equations are so close and cannot be distinguished even at
the low velocity region. This is because the disturbance caused by the significant effects of
relaxation term at 10 Hz.
Parameter Estimation with Fewer Test Data
In the previous section, test data of many frequencies are used to study the efficiencies of Eqs.
(13) and (14). However, full scale damper tests are so expensive that cyclic damper tests of many
frequencies are impractical. Hence, full scale damper parameters are supposed to be obtained with
less test data. When Eq. (11) is used, there are three parameters, C0, and m, to be determined if
the nominal silicone oil relaxation time is used as the damper relaxation time. Hence, three
equations must be provided so that the three parameters can be estimated. Integrate both sides of
Eq. (11) respect to the damper displacement (x):

The above equation is related to the energy dissipated by the damper in a displacement cycle.

where WD can be calculated by the output force-displacement loop of a cyclic test. When a
damper is tested at three frequencies, the three dissipated energies can be used in Eq. (16) to
provide the required three equations. Note that C0 is a parameter indicating the damping factor
when the damper is linear, hence, at least one test should be performed at low frequency when the
damper behavior is close to linear.
Chen’s 48.9-mm damper data [14] are used to verify the efficiency of Eq. (11) when the test
data are limited. The 1-Hz test data are used to determine the value of C0 using Eq. (12), and the
test data of two selected frequencies are used to determine the values of and m. Because test
data of each two frequencies produces a pair of and m values, and there are data tested at
frequencies from 2 to 10 Hz, many damper behavior curves without considering the relaxation
effects can be constructed and are shown in Fig. 11(a). Most curves in the figure cluster together
except some curves deviate from the main cluster at the high velocity region. The clustered results
