Abstract 
In general, in the field of communication 
and signal processing, the elements of array are 
viewed as independent point sensors, i.e., the 
receiving/transmitting signal of each array 
sensor is assumed to be a spherical wave. This 
assumption is made in both land and 
underwater communication systems. However, 
this assumption failed in the situations of 
shallow oceans, existence of obstacles, or array 
with small element spacing due to the mutual 
coupling effects. The purposes of this study are 
to investigate the mutual coupling effects in 
underwater arrays and then to modify the 
algorithms of array signal processing. 
For the current researches of underwater 
technology in the world, most of them are 
based on the theories of acoustic waves or 
signal processing techniques alone. Researches 
considering both theories of acoustic waves and 
signal processing techniques are scarcely found 
till present. Because the wave equations of 
acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves are 
the same, some techniques in land 
communication systems may be applied to the 
case in underwater environments. However, 
there still exist many differences of 
environment parameters between land and 
 3
combination of Gaussian functions. The 
multi-dimensional integrations on the integrand 
then become multi-dimensional integrations on 
the linear combination of Gaussian functions. 
The integration of a Gaussian function equals 
the error function which can be easily looked 
up in most mathematical handbooks. Therefore, 
the proposed method in this study requires 
neither artificial nor numerical technique of 
integration. 
 
II. SELF- AND MUTUAL-IMPEDANCE 
FORMULATIONS 
For simplicity without loss of generality, 
two identical rectangular pistons with 
dimension a×b in a sonar array are considered, 
as shown in Fig.1. 
In calculating the self-impedance for each 
piston of the array, the formulation in [2] can 
be modified as

where 1−=j , c is the velocity of sound in 
the medium, ρ  is the density of the medium, 
and k is the wavenumber. In (1), SR  is the 
self-resistance and SX  is the self-reactance. 
Therefore, the mutual resistance can be given 
as

As the mutual-impedance between the two

to a point ),(1 yxP  on piston-1 which vibrates

The mutual impedance mZ  of the two pistons 
may be found as the force due to the motion of

III. NEURAL NETWORK AND THE 
INTEGRATION 
In general, the computations of the four 
dimensional integrals in (2), (3), (6) and (7) are 
difficult. The new idea of integration on a 
neural network is then proposed to calculate 
them. 
Initially, the integrand, i.e., the function to be 
integrated, in (2), (3), (6) or (7) is modeled by 
the radial basis function based neural network 
(RBF-NN) [7,8]. The reasons for choosing this 
type of neural network are described in Section 
I. As shown in Fig.2, there is one node in the 
output layer representing the integrand of

in (3) or (7). There are four nodes in the input 
layer representing the four integral variables, 
i.e., ξ , η , x and y, in (8) or (9). There still 
exist J nodes in the hidden layer for nonlinear 
mapping. According to [8], the relation 
between the input and output variables of a 
RBF-NN can be expressed as

The functions )(⋅jg , j=1, 2, ……, J in (10) 
represent the nonlinear transformations of input 
variables. In general, they are multivariate 
Gaussian functions and are defined as

are two square pistons considered in this 
section, i.e., a = b in Fig.1. The RBF-NN of 
Fig.2 has 10 nodes for transformation in the 
hidden layer, i.e., J=10. The learning rate α  
in the training procedure is 0.1. 
In the first example, the self-impedance of 
each piston in Fig.1 is considered. Assume ka 
(= kb) varies from 0 to 8. Therefore, the four 
integral variables in (2) or (3) may vary in the 
range of 80 ≤≤ ξk , 80 ≤≤ ηk , 80 ≤≤ kx  
and 80 ≤≤ ky . The training data sets are then 
selected from the above intervals to train the 
RBF-NN. In this example, the training data sets 
are produced by 9 values of ξk , ηk , kx  and 
ky , respectively. They are all randomly 
selected from the above intervals. Therefore, in 
calculating the self-resistance SR , there are 
9×9×9×9 = 6561 data sets of (12) calculated 
from (8) to train the RBF-NN. After the 
RBF-NN is trained, the 
weights 0w , 1w , 2w ,…, Jw  within the RBF-NN 
are determined and the four dimensional 
integrals in (2) can be replaced by (16) by only 
simple algebraic operations. Following the 
procedures of Fig.3, the self-resistance, SR , can 
be calculated from (8) and (16). Fig.4 shows 
the normalized self-resistance, )/( 2caRS ρ , with 
respect to ka. For comparison, the results of [2] 
calculated by direct mathematical integrals are 
also given. It shows that they are very 
consistent. 
Similarly, in calculating the self-reactance, 
SX , there are also 9×9×9×9 = 6561 data sets of 
(12) calculated from (9) to train the RBF-NN. 
After the RBF-NN is trained, the 
weights 0w , 1w , 2w ,…, Jw  within the RBF-NN 
are determined and the four dimensional 
integrals in (3) can be replaced by (16) by only 
simple algebraic operations. Following the 
procedures of Fig.3, the self-reactance, SX , can 
be calculated from (9) and (16). Fig.5 shows 
the normalized self-reactance, )/( 2caX S ρ , with 
respect to ka. For comparison, the results of [2] 
calculated by direct mathematical integrals are 
also given. It shows that they are very 
consistent. 
In the second example, the 
mutual-impedance between the two pistons in 
Fig.1 is considered. The element spacing 
between the two pistons is 2/122 )( ghd += . 
For simplicity, we choose g = 0 and therefore 
we have d = h. Assume ka (= kb) varies from 0 
to 2 and kd varying from 2.5 to 17.5. Therefore, 
the four integral variables in (6) or (7) will vary 
in the range of 5.195.2 ≤≤ ξk , 20 ≤≤ ηk , 
20 ≤≤ kx  and 20 ≤≤ ky . The training data 
sets are then selected from the above intervals 
to train the RBF-NN. In this example, the 
training data sets are produced by 69 values of 
ξk , 5 values of ηk , 5 values of kx  and 5 
values of ky  (all randomly selected from the 
above intervals). Therefore, in calculating the 
mutual-resistance mR , there are 
69×5×5×5=8625 data sets of (12) calculated 
from (8) to train the RBF-NN. After the 
RBF-NN is trained, the 
weights 0w , 1w , 2w ,…, Jw  within the RBF-NN 
are determined and the four dimensional 
integrals in (6) can be replaced by (16) by only 
simple algebraic operations. Following the 
procedures of Fig.3, the mutual-resistance can 
be obtained from (8) and (16). Fig.6 shows the 
normalized mutual-resistance, )/( 2caRm ρ , with 
respect to element spacing kd for (a) ka=0.5, (b) 
ka=1 and (c) ka=2. For comparison, the results 
of [3] calculated by direct mathematical 
integrals are also given. It shows that they are 
in good agreement. 
Similarly, in calculating the 
mutual-reactance mX , there are also 
69×5×5×5=8625 data sets of (12) calculated 
from (9) to train the RBF-NN. After the 
RBF-NN is trained, the 
weights 0w , 1w , 2w ,…, Jw  within the RBF-NN 
are determined and the four dimensional 
integrals in (7) can be replaced by (16) by only 
simple algebraic operations. Following the 
procedures of Fig.3, the mutual-reactance can 
be obtained from (9) and (16). Fig.7 shows the 
normalized mutual-reactance, )/( 2caX m ρ , with 
respect to element spacing kd for (a) ka=0.5, (b) 
ka=1 and (c) ka=2. For comparison, the results 
of [3] calculated by direct mathematical 
integrals are also given. It shows that they are 
in good agreement.
