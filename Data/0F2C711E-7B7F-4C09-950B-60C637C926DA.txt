Since the long wave length modes (i.e., small wave
number ) may introduce flow instability to meet our
analysis objectives, the dimensionless stream function 
and pressure p are, therefore, expanded here in terms of
some small wave numberas

By plugging the above two equations into Eqs. (13)-(18), the
system governing equations can then be collected and solved
order by order. In practice, the non-dimensional surface
tension S is a large value, the term S2 can be treated as
a quantity of zeroth order [2-5]. For hRr  , the film
thickness h is very small, so it can obtain the power series
approximation solutions up to the order of 5)( Rr at zeroth
and first orders for stream function, 0 and 1 . By
plugging the solutions, 0 and 1 into the dimensionless
free surface kinematic equation of Eq. (18), the generalized
nonlinear kinematic equation is obtained and presented as

where )(hA , )(hB , )(hC , )(hD and )(hE are function of h. In
case of m=0, the fluid flow becomes a typical classical
Newtonian film flow. In case of R , the result agrees
exactly with the solution of plane flow. We employ linear
