Abstract  
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
system is a long-term investment for a 
company and affects its competitiveness. 
This project proposes a comprehensive 
framework for measuring the performance 
of an ERP system to survey the suitable 
performance indicators (PI) according to 
knowledge of the ERP implementation 
objectives set up at the implementation 
phase. A fuzzy ERP performance index is 
used to account for the ambiguities involved 
in evaluating the performance of the ERP 
system. The fuzzy ERP performance index 
can be translated first into simple scores and 
then back to linguistic terms. The evaluation 
results can represent the achievement of the 
ERP implementation objectives and the 
directions of ERP system improvement. 
 
Keywords: ERP; performance indicator; 
fuzzy set theory; Decision-making 
 
1. Introduction  
Owing to the highly severe market 
competition and the immense impact of 
advances in information technology (IT) 
progress, a number of companies have 
widely implemented the ERP system. One 
of the most significant challenges faced by 
information managers is measuring the 
performance of the adopted ERP system to 
justify its value-added contribution for 
accomplishing the organization’s missions. 
Furthermore, managers would also like to 
know which parts of their ERP need to 
improve and whether the system’s overall 
 3
company’s concerns. Based on the 
definitions, we find that the fundamental- 
objectives indicate the directions of ERP 
performance evaluation and some means- 
objectives are suitable to be PIs to value 
whether the fundamental- objectives have 
been accomplished as promised.  
We can start from a means-objective in 
the means-objective network to discuss 
whether it can be used to demonstrate a PI. 
After discussing, if the means-objective is a 
suitable PI, then add it into the PI set. If it is 
not a good PI, the managers can discuss, 
“How to evaluate whether this 
means-objective has been achieved?”. The 
answers can reveal some more detailed and 
new PIs. Add them to the PI set. Go through 
all means-objectives in the ERP objective 
structure, we can formulate an initial ERP 
PI set.  
2.2 Add other crucial PIs into the PI set with 
an ERP output view 
Whereas the initial PI set is expanded 
from the objectives of ERP adoption, the set 
can not entirely involve all PIs. The 
members should survey some proper PIs 
based on the output aspects of ERP system 
execution, like the impact of individual and 
organization. Then, these critical PIs can be 
added into the PI set.  
2.3 Construct the performance indicator 
structure 
The team members should organize the 
PIs into a hierarchy to conduce the data 
analysis. In order to be compatible with the 
ERP objective structure and consider the 
impact of individual and organization, we 
classify the PIs into three main categories:   
(1) System factors: indicators for evaluating 
the utilization of the ERP system.  
(2) Vendor factors: indicators for assessing the 
performance of the ERP vendor.  
(3) Impact factors: the impact of information 
on the organizational performance and 
individual.   
The team can review the indicators in 
the PI set and put them into perspective, the 
three main categories. Because too many 
PIs would make numerous evaluations. The 
team should iteratively examine and modify 
the PIs hierarchy so that they are complete, 
decomposable, non-redundant, measurable 
and minimal (Keeney and Raiffa, 1993).  
2.4 Develop the detailed performance 
measurement guidance 
It is important to have an explicit 
understanding of how a PI is measured. A 
standard form can help them to collect the 
data and conduct the performance 
assessment. The knowledge of the 
objectives can not only help in identifying 
the PIs, but also indicating how outcomes 
must be measured and what kinds of 
uncertainties should be considered.  
Weightings associated with PIs can be 
assigning simultaneously. The weight of 
each PI can be determined by direct 
assignment or indirect comparisons like the 
analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Saaty, 
1994). We can obtain a weighting vector, W. 
The values in vector W have the domain 
range (0, 1). 
2.5 Assess the performance indicators 
The quantitative PIs are evaluated 
using marginal value function in terms of 
direct and inverse linear relationship. A 
baseline of each PI can be setting to easily 
analyze the gap in what is being collected

(3) if )]()
~([)~( 121 ++−= jTjTT dIdIcIM θθθ , the 
linguistic term is between jd
~
 and 1
~
+jd . 
2.7 Analyze the results and improve the ERP 
system 
After assessment, graphs and reports 
can be built to show the achievement of 
each fundamental-objective and show 
whether the overall ERP system is making 
progress or losing ground. By studying the 
trends of scores, the managers can set 
meaningful plans for improvement.  
Due to inevasible changes in the ERP 
system and its environment, the ERP 
performance measurement framework is 
dynamic. Periodic ERP performance 
assessments should be undertaken to 
provide a basis for the practice of 
continuous improvement. Additionally, this 
framework is conducted whenever the need 
for a new PI is realized. The values of 
0
iv  
and 
*
iv  about those quantitative indicators 
are not fixed forever, they would be 
changed over time after a cautious 
discussion of the managers. 
 
3. Practical example 
The case company is in the business of 
microwave communication systems design, 
manufacturing, and sale to USA, Europe, 
and Mainland China. Adopting an ERP 
system was expected to be the logical 
solution that could replace and integrate the 
legacy systems. After adopting the ERP 
system, the information managers hoped to 
know how the ERP system is currently 
performing and how it should be 
performing at a future point in time. They 
want to justify the success of the ERP 
system to accomplish the objectives.  
Step 1. An ERP performance 
measurement project team with 6 members 
was formed, including 5 major managers 
and the information manager. Other critical 
user representatives also were chose to join 
this team.  
The members started from an existed 
means-objective of a bottom level 
fundamental-objective in the objective 
structure to discuss whether it was suitable 
to be a PI following the process presented in 
Section 2.1.  
Once the ERP implementation project 
is complete, some fundamental- objectives 
and relative critical problems, like project

    Following the linguistic term 
translation rules to get 0334.0=M  of rule (2) 
was minimum. As Gd =4 , the linguistic 
description of “function fitness” was 
“Good”.  
Step 7. Went through all the 
fundamental-objectives by using the 
proposed fuzzy aggregative method to 
obtain their fuzzy performance index and 
performance scores. Rolled them up to gain 
the fuzzy performance index and 
performance scores of the three main 
categories. Following the linguistic term 
translation rules, the linguistics of all 
fundamental-objectives and main categories 
could be obtained. The final linguistic term 
of the adopted ERP system performance at 
the certain time was “between fair and 
good”. 
We helped them to collect the data and 
track the scores 6 months after the ERP 
performance measurement system 
establishing. Fig. 2 shows the score trends 
of the three categories. A significant 
progress on the system and impact 
categories had been made; however, the 
scores of ERP vendor indicator category 
had not improved over time. Fig. 3 indicates 
the detailed score records of vendor PIs. 
The fundamental- objectives “training 
support” and “service ability” related PIs 
had made regression. The managers hoped 
that the ERP vendor could provide more 
support and service to continuously 
improve the ERP functions and reports. 
They decided to strengthen the relationship 
with the ERP vendor. A problem feedback 
mechanism and a solving problem process 
were also established.  
 
4. Conclusions 
This project develops a framework to 
measure the performance of an adopted 
ERP system under fuzzy environment. The 
framework developed an ERP PI structure 
according to the knowledge of ERP 
implementation objectives. An integration 
model that uses the fuzzy integral method 
was proposed to obtain a fuzzy ERP 
performance index. Then, the fuzzy ERP 
performance index can be translated into a 
performance score and back to a linguistic 
term. The evaluation results can reflect the 
current situation of the ERP system and the 
accomplishment of the objectives.
