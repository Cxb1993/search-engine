英文摘要： 
The present work reports on the excellent thermal stability of Cu(ReTa) and Cu(ReTaNx) seed 
layers sputtered on a barrierless Si substrate. These copper alloy films were fabricated by reactive 
co-sputtering of Cu with Re/Ta in Ar/N2 atmosphere. Cu(ReTa) and Cu(ReTaNx) films were 
annealed at 630°C and 750°C, respectively, for 1 h; no copper silicide formation was observed at 
the Cu–Si interface. Cu films containing traces of ReTaNx, which was thermally stable up to 750°C, 
exhibited low leakage current and resistivity. The stability of ReTaNx indicates the potential 
applicability of Cu(ReTaNx) in advanced barrierless metallization. The thermal performance of the 
Cu(ReTaNx) film was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), focused ion beam microscopy, and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results of these evaluations confirmed that the seed 
layer–Si interface was thermally stable even after annealing at 750°C for 1 h. This seed layer 
prevented the undesired reaction of Cu with Si. The electrical resistivities of the Cu(ReTa) and 
Cu(ReTaNx) films were 3.05 and 2.35 µΩ-cm after annealing at 630°C and 750°C, respectively.

1. Introduction 
Copper metallization is preferred over 
aluminum metallization because copper has 
higher electrical conductivity and lower 
susceptibility to electromigration as compared 
to aluminum. Accordingly, Cu has been 
widely used for the manufacture of ultra 
large-scale integrated circuits. However, Cu 
metallization has a major drawback: Cu 
diffuses easily into the silicon or SiO2 matrix, 
resulting in the undesired formation of copper 
silicide. Therefore, electronic components are 
typically manufactured at low temperatures to 
prevent the formation of copper silicide. 
Generally, the interdiffusion of Cu and Si is 
prevented by introducing a barrier layer (e.g., 
TaN). When microelectronic devices are 
scaled down to the nanometer range, their 
resistance increases because of phenomena 
such as electron scattering and grain boundary 
scattering [1]; therefore, the use of barrierless 
or barrier-free Cu metallization is essential. To 
achieve barrierless metallization, an 
immiscible material is co-sputtered with pure 
Cu to form a Cu alloy film. The resultant Cu 
alloy film has high thermal stability, and when 
interposed between Cu and Si, forms an 
effective reaction barrier. 
Barrierless metallization can simplify 
the manufacturing process of electronic 
devices, thereby reducing manufacturing costs. 
Cu alloy films have enhanced thermal stability 
because the insoluble components of the alloy 
(e.g., W) [2] form distinct microstructures that 
exhibit good thermal properties. Alloying of 
Cu with insoluble components has several 
important applications and is crucial in 
materials science. Previous studies [2-9] have 
shown that Cu(ReN) [6] alloy films are 
thermally stable up to 730 °C. In the present 
study, we investigate the thermal properties of 
Cu(ReTa) and Cu(ReTaNx) films on 
barrierless Si substrates after annealing these 
films at different temperatures. We also 
examine the thermally induced changes in the 
crystals and in the microstructures of these 
alloy systems with a view to elucidating their 
effects on the electrical properties (leakage 
current, resistivity, and time-dependent 
dielectric breakdown (TDDB) lifetime) of the 
alloys. 
 In addition, as in the case of the previous 
study [10], the present study also explored the 
possibility of using Cu(ReTaNx) as a copper 
electrode, which is used in high-k complex 
oxide thin-film devices. This study was 
conducted to address the high cost, fairly high 
resistivity, and undesirable rough surface 
morphologies associated with the presence of 
platinum undergoing hillock formation during 
annealing. This research focused on a 
Cu-based contact, i.e., a Cu(ReTaNx) contact, 
because of its thermal stability against 
temperatures up to 750°C for 1 h. Among 
various high-dielectric candidates, tantalum 
pentoxide (Ta2O5) has been studied as a 
promising material for a gate dielectric of 
metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect 
transistors because of its high dielectric 
constant and excellent thermal and chemical 
stability [11,12]. For evaluating the electrical 
properties, the 
Si/SiO2/TaN/Cu(ReTaNx)/BTO/Pt stack 
structure for a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) 
capacitor device is prepared and characterized. 
2. Experimental Procedure 
Two types of 300-nm-thick Cu films 
were prepared in this study. The first film 
consisted of 0.8 at.% Re, 1.2 at.% Ta, and 0.3 
at.% N, and the second one consisted of 0.5 
at.% Re and 0.4 at.% Ta. These films were 
deposited on barrierless Si(100) substrates. 
The Cu films were fabricated as follows: Cu 
was introduced in the Re/Ta targets and 
co-sputtering was carried out under an Ar/N2 
gas atmosphere at a pressure of 7 × 10–3 Torr. 
Hereafter, these films will be referred to as 
Cu(ReTaNx) and Cu(ReTax) films, 
respectively.  
The formation of alloy films was 
confirmed by secondary ion mass 
spectroscopy (SIMS) and electron probe 
microanalysis (EPMA). The samples were 
post-annealed for 1 h under a vacuum of 10-7 
Torr at temperatures of up to 780 °C. The 
crystal structure and microstructure of the 
annealed films were characterized by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS), focused ion beam (FIB) 
microscopy, transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM), and X-ray energy dispersive 
spectroscopy (EDS). The resistivity of the 
films was measured at room temperature using 
a four-point probe method, and the leakage

(before annealing) after 20 min of sputter 
etching: (a) Cu 2p3, (b) Re 4f, (c) Ta 4f, and (d) 
N 1s.  
  Figure 3 shows the results of resistivity 
measurements carried out for a variety of Cu 
alloy films before and after annealing. 
Unannealed Cu(ReTa) and Cu(ReTaNx) films 
exhibit high electrical resistance, which is due 
to the alloying effects of Cu(ReTa) and 
Cu(ReTaNx) and the intrinsically fine 
microstructures. After annealing at 630 °C, the 
resistivity of the Cu(ReTa) and Cu(ReTaNx) 
films reduces to 3.05 µΩ-cm and 2.73 µΩ-cm, 
respectively. However, once the annealing 
temperature exceeds 630 °C, a reaction occurs 
between Cu(ReTa) and silicon, which leads to 
the formation of copper silicide. When the 
annealing temperature is increased to 750°C, 
the resistivity of Cu(ReTaNx) films further 
decreases to 2.35 µΩ-cm. This may be due to 
the stress release induced by the precipitation 
of Re, Ta, and N. In other words, the 
annealing of pure Cu films leads to the 
generation of copper silicide, which in turn 
increases the resistivity of the films.  
Our results show that Cu (ReTaNx) films 
deposited on barrier-free Si have excellent 
thermal stability up to 750 °C. In other words, 
Cu(ReTaNx) is more stable than MoN and WN 
barriers; however, it is less stable than W2N 
(stable up to 790 °C). These results confirm 
that Cu(ReTaNx) seed layer is advantageous 
for use in barrierless metallization.  
Figure 4 shows the SIMS depth profiles 
of pure Cu, Cu(ReTa), and Cu(ReTaNx) films 
annealed at 400 °C. From these profiles we 
can observe that the Cu diffusion depth of 
Cu(ReTaNx) films is less than that of Cu(ReTa) 
films at the same annealing temperature. 
These findings further confirm that 
Cu(ReTaNx) films have enhanced thermal 
stability.

Cu(ReTa), and Cu(ReTaNx) films on Si after 
annealing at 400 °C for 1 h.  
  Figure 5 (a) shows the cross-sectional TEM 
images of a Cu(ReTaNx) film before annealing; 
in this figure, an approximately 1.3-nm-thick 
native oxide layer can be observed between 
the Cu(ReTaNx) film and the Si substrate. 
Figure 5 (b) shows the cross-sectional TEM 
images of the Cu(ReTaNx) film annealed at 
760 °C; from this figure we can observe that 
recrystallization occurred within the film, 
resulting in grain growth (123 ± 6 nm). From 
this figure as well as Fig. 3, we can conclude 
that the decrease in resistance of the film is 
due to coarse-grain recrystallization, which is 
in agreement with our resistivity measurement 
results (~2.35 µΩ-cm). Figure 5 (b) also 
shows the thickness of the oxide layer. The 
circled areas in Figure 5 (b) indicate that the 
thickness of the native oxide layer is 
approximately 1.6 nm. The selected-area

large extent of Cu diffusion through SiO2 
during annealing. At 2 MV/cm, leakage 
current of the Cu (ReTaNx) film (4.38 × 10-11 
A/cm2) is lower than that of the Cu(RuHfNx) 
(1.9 × 10-10 A/cm2), Cu(ReNx) (1.32 × 10-10 
A/cm2) [6], Cu(WN) (4.9 × 10-9 A/cm2) [4], 
Cu(Mo) (3.8 × 10-8 A/cm2) [3], Cu(RuNx) (3 × 
10-10 A/cm2) [5], and pure Cu (1.6 × 10-7 
A/cm2) films [2]. The low leakage current of 
the Cu(ReTaNx) films confirms their excellent 
thermal stability. Owing to their high thermal 
stability, these films are suitable for use in 
barrier-free metallization. These results are 
consistent with the SIMS results shown in 
Figure 4.  
Figure 6 (b) shows the I-V curves of 
three types of capacitors stressed at 2.7 
MV/cm. The results show an abrupt increase 
in current, indicating structural failure (Figure 
5 (b)). With time, the charges trapped in the 
oxide layer also increase. The time required 
for the copper ion concentration at the SiO2/Si 
interface to reach a critical value is 1000 s, 
74300 s, and 97800 s for the Cu, Cu(ReTa), 
and Cu(ReTaNx) films, respectively. Once the 
critical concentration is reached, a conductive 
path is created between the cathode and the 
anode. At concentrations higher than this 
critical value, a leakage current flows through 
the oxide layer and causes structural failure. 
At 2.7 MV/cm, the failure time for the pure 
Cu film is shorter than that for the Cu(ReTa) 
film; at the same electric field strength, the 
failure time for the pure Cu film is 
considerably shorter than that for the 
Cu(ReTaNx) film. This result also confirms 
the high thermal stability of the Cu(ReTaNx) 
alloy film. 
Figure 6 (c) shows the TDDB lifetimes 
of the pure Cu, Cu(ReTa), and Cu(ReTaNx) 
films as a function of the electric field. A plot 
of the failure time with respect to the applied 
stress voltage indicates that the TDDB 
lifetimes of the Cu(ReTa) and Cu(ReTaNx) 
films satisfy the 10-year projected reliability. 
The lifetime of Cu(ReTaNx) films is 
considerably longer than that of Cu(ReTa) and 
pure Cu films. Again, this observation 
confirms the high thermal stability of 
Cu(ReTaNx) films. This trend is similar to that 
observed for metal barrier layers such as TiN 
[18], Ta [18], and TaN [18]. 
Figure 7 shows the typical electric 
resistivity of the Cu-based contact before and 
after it was annealed. The electrical resistance 
of the as-deposited films was high (~53.84 
µΩ-cm); however, it considerably decreased 
to 3.73 µΩ-cm after the films were annealed 
at 400°C, reaching a minimum value of 3.24 
µΩ-cm at 660°C. The observed decrease in 
resistivity is a consequence of recrystallization, 
grain growth, defect annihilation, and stress 
relief in the contact during annealing [5]. 
However, it was observed that the resistivity 
of the samples slightly increased when they 
were annealed at 700°C. Such an increase in

The Si/SiO2/TaN/Cu(ReTaNx)/Ta2O5/Pt MIM 
capacitors with Cu(ReTaNx) bottom 
electrodes have a longer lifetime than pure Cu 
capacitors. The extrapolated long-term 
lifetime indicates that the 
Si/SiO2/TaN/Cu(ReTaNx)/Ta2O5/Pt MIM 
capacitors with Cu(ReTaNx) bottom 
electrodes can survive for 10 years at a stress 
field of 1.72 MV/cm. This fact indicates that 
the Si/SiO2/TaN/Cu(ReTaNx)/Ta2O5/Pt MIM 
capacitors with Cu-based bottom electrodes 
are of high quality and exhibit good 
uniformity.

4. Summary  
Cu(ReTa) and Cu(ReTaNx) films 
containing trace amounts of ReTa and ReTaNx 
exhibited resistances of 3.05 and 2.35 µΩ-cm, 
respectively, when annealed at corresponding 
temperatures of 630 °C and 750 °C for 1 h and 
deposited on barrierless Si. The formation of 
copper silicide was not detected in these films, 
which indicates that the films have excellent 
thermal stability, low leakage current, and low 
resistivity. Furthermore, the leakage current of 
these films was less than that of pure Cu films 
by approximately three orders of magnitude. 
The Cu alloy films also exhibited improved 
adhesion in the as-deposited and annealed 
states. In addition, on account of their long 
TDDB lifetimes (>10 years), Cu(ReTa) and 
Cu(ReTaNx) films are considered promising 
candidates for interconnect materials. In 
addition, the Ta2O5 film fabricated on a 
barrierless Cu(ReTaNx) stack structure by 
magnetron sputtering has been characterized. 
The Ta2O5 film on the barrierless stack 
structure is thermally stable, and no 
interaction between the film and the stack 
structure is observed up to 660°C. After 
annealing, the electrical resistivity of the 
Cu(ReTaNx) contact becomes relatively low, 
~3.24 µΩ-cm. The extrapolated long-term 
lifetime of the 
Si/SiO2/TaN/Cu(ReTaNx)/Ta2O5/Pt MIM 
capacitors with Cu(ReTaNx) bottom 
electrodes indicates that these capacitors can

本計劃係藉濺鍍(Sputter Deposition)方式製作摻雜不互溶物質(Ir, Sc, Ta)
之銅導線
薄膜，依此與合作產商汎銓公司進行產學合作。除探討在不同製程條件下(等溫
退火、
循環持溫退火)因不互溶物質之添加對矽上之銅矽化合物抑制性、高溫穩定性、
切面顯
微組織、結晶性及附著性之影響外，進而利用汎銓公司之材料分析專業作切面
顯微組織
之探討(如FIB、TEM等)，依此結果研發低電阻材料以應用於未來無阻障層銅金
屬化製
程。由先期有關銅鉬等合金薄膜之研究結果顯示依濺鍍方式可製得含不互溶物
質之銅過
飽和固溶相薄膜，經退火後因顯微組織改善仍具良好性質。此外，亦可在濺鍍
時導入微
量氣體以改善濺鍍銅薄膜之高溫穩定性與附著力。這些研究成果皆已發表於In this project, sputter deposition is used to produce conductive
copper thin films doped with insoluble materials (Ir, Sc, and Ta).
This study is being performed in collaboration with MSSCORPS CO., LTD
and by cooperation between various academic institutes and industrial
set ups. The effect of addition of different insoluble materials on
the characteristics of thin films prepared under different
manufacturing conditions (isothermal and cyclic annealing), such as
inhibition of copper silicide formation, thermal stability, cross-
sectional microstructure, crystallization, and adhesion will be
investigated. In this study, the high electrical conductivity,
thermal stability, and adhesion ability of these thin films and time-
dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) in the films will be assessed,
and the results will be used for advanced barrierless copper電機及電子機械器材業
摻雜不互溶物質之無阻障層銅合金薄膜技術應用範圍涵蓋導電材料、金屬材料、無鉛
焊料等電子封裝製程範圍
掺雜不互溶物質之無阻障層銅導線薄膜技術有利台灣半導體整體技術的提昇具技轉可
