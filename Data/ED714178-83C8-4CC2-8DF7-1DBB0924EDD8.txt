一、緒論 
隨著交通路網建設日趨擴充，路況資訊亦愈形複雜，資訊可變標誌（Variable 
Message Signs；VMS）的資訊顯示受限於字數限制，已無法滿足資訊呈現的需
求，因而發展可呈現整體資訊的－圖誌可變標誌（Changeable Graphical Signs, 
CGS）， 便成為一種趨勢。Eiji Hato 等（1995）的研究指出對於路網不熟悉者無
法充分利用可變標誌所提供的資訊，而圖誌可變標誌的地圖化介面將可以解決此
問題，圖誌可變標誌具備地圖導引與路況顯示之雙重功能將有助於協助路徑不熟
悉的駕駛者達到轉向之目的。相較於 VMS，圖誌可變標誌可以同時呈現更多訊
息，複雜的訊息變的容易呈現且有效率，因此當交通路網特別複雜或某一路網有
多處擁塞時，CGS 就有較佳優勢。尤其 CGS 可同時呈現不同路徑的資訊，駕駛
人可一次接收所有可能路徑的訊息，有別於一般文數字 VMS 每次只能呈現單一
目的地之資訊，較文數字 VMS 而言，具有較佳的路徑識別能力(Alkim and 
Mede,2000)。 
圖誌可變標誌藉由圖型化介面能提供駕駛者空間感、方向感和即時路況資
訊的多功能標誌，此標誌相當適用於路徑交錯的路網，但也因其容納的資訊內容
有許多可能，致使交通單位在設置時為之怯步，深恐過多的資訊內容將影響駕駛
者安全或是無法獲得駕駛者理解。國內交通路網隨著道路開發，亦逐漸複雜，圖
誌可變標誌也逐一設置中。因此有必要針對國內圖誌可變標誌之設置，參考人因
工程的圖誌設計原則，從人因工程的角度予以探討研究，以作為相關規範制定之
參考。本研究目的即在探討適當的 CGS 資訊組合，以提供相關交通單位設計出
符合資訊傳達者（管理者）與資訊接收者（駕駛者）期望的圖誌可變標誌，進而
有助於解決道路交通壅塞之情形。 
另外，國外針對 VMS 的研究，主要採用實驗室模擬研究（Simulator 
Experiment）與狀態偏好法（Stated Preference Approach, SP）兩種方法（Dutta et 
al.，2004；Wardman et al.，1997）。國內的研究則以實驗研究與一般調查問卷為
主。由於圖誌可變標誌主要應用於複雜路網的路徑選擇，而狀態偏好法對駕駛用
路人在面對路徑選擇時的行為反應有良好的預測能力。由於國內目前的圖誌可變
標誌為初步階段，因此在設計及顯示功能方面尚有很多的改進空間，本研究第一
年首先針對國內外現有之圖誌可變標誌做分析評估，進一步的再以國內的交通標
誌設置原則以及人因標示設計原則作為圖誌可變標誌的設計準則，發展新型的圖
誌可變標誌，以作為實驗刺激之用。第二年則採用狀態偏好研究法來探討國人對
圖誌可變標誌的反應行為，並進而比較模擬實驗與狀態偏好兩種研究法的差異。 
 
二、文獻探討 
 
2.1 國內相關研究 
有關圖誌可變標誌之研究，高公局在「高快速公路整體路網交通管理系綜合
規劃成果報告」中闢有專章說明各項資訊顯示系統設置的考量，並指出為提高用
 - 4 - 
 
時間、文字描述與燈號標誌三種 VMS 方式呈現道路的交通狀況對駕駛人路徑選
擇的影響，結果發現精確數字呈現估計時間的方式對路徑選擇之效益較文字描述
與燈號標誌為低，其原因可能係香港駕駛人仍未熟悉透過數字呈現行車時間的資
訊。 
 
三、圖誌可變標誌之分析與設計 
 
3.1 現有圖誌可變標誌分析 
目前國內圖誌可變標誌主要設置於系統交流道前方用來顯示前方路網狀
況，以顏色變化來表示各路段的壅塞程度，紅色代表一級壅塞，橙色代表二級壅
塞，未顯示代表不壅塞，具備路網轉向導引功能，供駕駛人參考選擇其較佳行車
路徑。 
國內的圖誌可變標誌依交通壅塞程度高低顯示紅色、橙色與不顯示之黑色，
相較於其他國家以雙色表示法的設計只能呈現是否壅塞的兩種狀況，三色表示能
進一步提供不同壅塞程度的路況，但其缺點在於只能以路徑顏色來表示路況，在
資訊的表達上仍不夠明確，由於顏色屬於定性資訊，因此顏色代表的是一種區間
性資料的概況，例如紅色代表時速 0-40(h/km)，而橙色代表時速 40-80(h/km)，而
不顯示之黑色代表時速 80(h/km)以上，因此當駕駛者看到路徑顏色雖可知其道路
壅塞概況，但駕駛者仍無法得知壅塞路徑的實際時速為多少，對於駕駛者在路徑
抉擇與行車速度上的掌控上陷入一種不確定性，因此若是在圖誌可變標誌裡加入
顯示時速的功能，便可讓駕駛者更了解前方路徑時速，對於駕駛者的路徑抉擇判
斷以及行車速度掌控會有更明確的認知。 
國外在日本、澳洲、德國、西班牙、荷蘭等國皆已設置圖誌可變標誌，稱為
GRIP（Graphical Route Information Panel），而英國稱為 GCDPs（Graphical 
Congestion Display Panels）。日本、澳洲、德國、西班牙以兩種顏色表示路況，
荷蘭以三種顏色表示路況，而英國以兩種顏色表示路況且增設旅行時間於箭頭上
方，或以三種顏色表示路況，或以顏色表示路況且增設旅行時間於路徑上，或以
旅行時間的 LED 顯示顏色亦同時代表著此路段是否有壅塞之狀況等，可謂
定性與定量資訊兼俱。 
綜合上述的圖誌可變標誌，可知在路徑的用色方面，圖誌可變標誌大多以路
經顏色表示道路的交通狀況，且顯示顏色數量不超過三種，其中分為雙色表示法
與三色表示法。雙色表示法分為兩種第一種是依交通是否壅塞顯示紅色與不顯示
時之黑色，第二種是依交通是否壅塞顯示黃色與綠色；而三色表示法分為兩種，
第一種是依交通壅塞程度高低顯示紅色、黃色與不顯示之黑色，第二種是依交通
壅塞程度高低顯示紅色、黃色與綠色。 
在旅行時間的放置位置方面，荷蘭、澳洲將旅行時間放置於路徑旁顯示，而
英國將旅行時間放置於路徑箭頭處或路徑中央或路徑上方，且其旅行時間字體顏
色亦同時代表著此路段是否壅塞之意義。在旅行時間的字體顏色方面，荷蘭、澳

四、模擬駕駛實驗 
 
本研究以模擬駕駛實驗探討 CGS 對駕駛者行為反應之影響。實驗分為「自
由選擇路徑」與「選擇最佳路徑」。自由選擇路徑實驗其目的為了解駕駛者在自
然的狀態下選擇其欲行駛的路徑，因此實驗要求受試者依其自身的知識經驗自由
的選擇路徑，實驗收集路徑選擇比例與反應時間用以了解駕駛者的路徑抉擇；而
選擇最佳路徑實驗其目的為了解駕駛者對圖誌可變標誌的理解度，因此實驗要求
受試者選擇一條最佳的路徑，實驗收集反應正確率與反應時間用以衡量駕駛者對
不同 CGS 資訊組合的理解度。 
 
4.1 自由選擇路徑實驗 
實驗自變項為 CGS 的路網型態與可變資訊，應變項為受試者的路徑選擇比
例與反應時間。實驗前受試者須閱讀圖誌可變標誌之基本介紹但不被告知與要求
選擇所謂的最佳路徑路徑，而依其自有的知識經驗在實驗中接收到 CGS 實驗刺
激時自由的做出反應動作，實驗收集受試者的路徑選擇比例與反應時間，用以了
解受試者在自由選擇狀態下，面對不同 CGS 資訊組合的駕駛者抉擇。 
(1)實驗刺激設計 
本研究探討的 CGS 資訊組合為「路網型態」與「可變資訊」，「路網型態」
是依據我國目前高速公路最常見之兩種路網型態分為三角形路網與四角形路
網。而可變資訊則是針對圖誌可變標誌看板裡可變資訊內容作安排，根據我國高
速公路目前所使用的圖誌可變標誌，其可變資訊為路徑顏色，藉由 LED 路徑顏

1. 路徑決策比例：為了解受試者在自然認知的情況下受到圖誌可變標誌影響而
做出的路徑決策。依據受試者反應動作得知其選擇的路徑，再比對相對應的圖誌
可變標誌以了解其路徑決策，並歸類出「正面決策」與「負面決策」兩種決策的
比例。所謂「正面決策」指的是受試者觀看圖誌可變標誌後選擇了避開壅塞路徑，
做出了有益的決策，而對疏導交通壅塞有正面的效果；而「負面決策」指的是受

39.58%）其做出正面決策的比例皆較低。 
由以上分析可知受試者在三角形路網中對可變資訊為路徑顏色的反應正確
率較高，而受試者在四角形路網中對可變資訊為路徑顏色+整合旅行時間的反應
正確率較高；而受試者在三角形路網與四角型路網中當可變資訊為個別路徑時速
的反應正確率皆較低。且受試者在四角型路網中的可變資訊為路徑顏色+個別路
徑時速與路徑顏色的反應正確率有顯著差異。 
2. 反應時間 
不同可變資訊與路網型態對受試者之反應時間統計結果如表 4-2。就可變資
訊而言，受試者對路徑顏色的反應時間較短（15.468 秒），而對路徑顏色+整合
旅行時間的反應時間較長（16.334 秒）；在路網型態部份，受試者對三角形路網
之的反應時間較短（15.474 秒），而對四角形路網的反應時間較長（16.510 秒）。

經由變異數分析，進一步發現可變資訊與路網型態具交互作用，當路網型態
為三角形時，若搭配可變資訊為路徑顏色則受試者的反應時間較短（15.114 秒），
若搭配可變資訊為路徑顏色+整合旅行時間則受試者的反應時間較長（16.073
秒）；當路網型態為四角形時，若搭配可變資訊為路徑顏色則受試者的反應時間
較短（15.821 秒），若搭配可變資訊為路徑顏色+個別路徑時間則受試者的反應
時間較長（17.020 秒）。 
由以上分析可知受試者在三角形與四角形路網中對可變資訊為路徑顏色的
反應時間皆較短，而受試者在三角形路網中對可變資訊為路徑顏色+整合旅行時
間的反應時間較長，而受試者在四角形路網中對可變資訊為路徑顏色+個別路徑
時速的反應時間較長。且受試者對可變資訊為路徑顏色、路徑顏色+個別路徑旅
行時間與路徑顏色+個別路徑時速、路徑顏色+整合旅行時間有顯著差異。 
 
4.2 選擇最佳路徑實驗

選擇最佳路徑實驗，除了實驗反應作業與資料收集外，其實驗設計、實驗刺

    實驗結果顯示受試者對兩種路網型態的反應正確率相當接近，但在反應時間
部分，四角型路網的反應時間較長。當可變資訊為路徑顏色時，不論搭配何種路
網型態皆有較佳的反應時間與反應正確率，能協助受試者快速且正確的做出路徑
選擇決策。因此建議相關交通單位在建構 CGS 時，可以考慮採用僅以路徑顏色
表示道路壅塞狀況之 CGS，此種資訊組合有助於駕駛者快速了解及做出正面的
路徑決策，使 CGS 能發揮疏導交通壅塞之功能與縮短駕駛者的旅行時間。若搭
配之資訊為路徑顏色+個別路徑時速，反應時間與反應正確率皆不理想，故不建
議採用。另外，若希望能進一步提供更詳盡的旅行資訊，三角形路網可搭配路徑
顏色+個別路徑旅行時間，受試者的反應正確率僅次於路徑顏色。四角形路網可
考慮搭配路徑顏色+整合旅行時間，其反應正確率與反應時間皆優於路徑顏色+
個別路徑旅行時間與路徑顏色+個別路徑時速。 
 
五、狀態偏好研究法對圖誌可變標誌的反應行為調查 
本研究之目的在於探討高速公路駕駛者，對不同資訊組合（路徑顏色、路徑
顏色+旅行時間、路徑顏色+旅行時速、路徑顏色+整合旅行時間）的圖誌可變標
誌偏好與決策反應。研究透過敘述偏好法進行問卷設計，藉由不同情境設計了解
路徑顏色、路網複雜度與資訊組合對駕駛者偏好與路徑決策之影響。並以二元羅
吉特模式分析建構駕駛者對不同資訊組合之路徑決策模型，以作為未來相關單位
建置之參考。 
 
5.1 調查資料分析 
問卷調查期間自民國 97 年 2 月 24 日至 4 月 19 日，於西螺、清水、南投服
務區，針對中部地區高速公路駕駛者進行面對面訪談，共發放問卷 283 份，回收
樣本數為 283 份，回收率 100 %，在扣除填答不完整或內容有瑕疵之問卷後，有
效樣本 239 份，有效問卷為 84.5 %。有效回收樣本受訪者之社經旅次特性統計摘
述如表 5-1。 
本次調查之受訪者以男性居多，佔 63.6%。年齡層以 26~55 歲為主要受訪年
齡層，佔 76.6%。職業部份除從事農漁牧業外，其餘則分佈平均。教育程度以大
學專科為主，佔整體的 56.1%。婚姻狀況以未婚的比例較高，約佔 61.1%。個人
平均月所得集中於 2~4 萬元及 4~6 萬元兩個層級，分別佔 40.2%、26.8%。 
在旅次特性的部份，受訪者實際開車經驗普遍集中於 5 年以上，佔整體的
64.4%，可知國人駕駛經驗普遍較高；在行駛高(快)速道路頻率部分，偶爾行駛
佔 53.1%，其次是每週都會行駛佔整體 27.2%，由此得知受訪者使用高(快)速道
路較為頻繁。

塞與車多的道路狀況卻容易讓駕駛者造成混淆，對其路徑決策造成影響。
交通管理單位在應用定性資訊時須謹慎留意，否則容易造成駕駛者混淆而
無法做出正面決策。 
（5）路網呈現型態部份，駕駛者對簡化路網圖與擬真路網圖並無特別之偏好。
然而呈現型態在低路網複雜度時，資訊組合為路徑顏色+旅行時速、路徑顏
色+整合旅行時間，擬真路網圖比簡化路網圖的駕駛者正面決策提升 20%。
在高路網複雜度則沒有差異。若路網複雜度低，建構圖誌可便資訊標誌時
若搭配資訊組合為路徑顏色+旅行時速、路徑顏色+整合旅行時間，建議可
以考慮以擬真路網型態呈現，有助於提升駕駛者正面決策。 
 
5.3 駕駛者對情境組合之認知分析 
（1）在低路網複雜度時，駕駛者認為路徑顏色+旅行時速最容易理解，其次依序
是路徑顏色+旅行時間、路徑顏色+整合旅行時間與單純路徑顏色。然而當
路網複雜度提升時，駕駛者認為最易理解的仍是路徑顏色+旅行時速，接著
是路徑顏色+整合旅行時間、路徑顏色，最後是路徑顏色+旅行時間。造成
此種結果可能原因為路網複雜度的提升造成資訊量的增加，旅行時間與旅
行時速之差異點在於駕駛者較習慣接收以旅行時速敘述道路狀況的呈現方
式且駕駛者觀看到旅行時間後，仍需透過一個加總的轉換動作才能進行判
斷，因此在路網複雜度提升後，造成駕駛者負荷增加且不易理解。 
（2）資訊組合為路徑顏色+旅行時速與路徑顏色+旅行時間為駕駛者自認為理解
且正面決策比例最高的兩個資訊組合，其次是路徑顏色+整合旅行時間，最
後是路徑顏色。 
（3）四種資訊組合中，路網複雜度提升時，路徑顏色+旅行時速的負面決策比例
最低，單純路徑顏色則是負面比例最高的資訊組合。 
 
六、結論 
 
整體而言，從模擬實驗得知受試者對路徑顏色的反應績效較佳，對路徑顏色
+個別路徑時速的反應績效則較差。但從狀態偏好法得知路徑顏色+旅行時速為
駕駛者較為偏好且能夠理解的資訊組合；路徑顏色+旅行時間由於提供之訊息更
為精確，駕駛者較能做出最佳路徑決策。 
    實驗室模擬法與敘述偏好問卷法之主要差異在於前者具有時間壓力，且駕駛
者受過教育訓練能充分理解各圖誌可變標誌資訊組合所代表之意義，後者無時間
壓力，但卻只能由主觀看法進行決策判斷。在已充分理解各資訊組合意義且具有
時間壓力之下，在路網複雜度低時，資訊組合為路徑顏色+旅行時速，駕駛者正
面決策比例為四種資訊組合中最佳；當路網複雜度提升時，資訊組合為路徑顏
色、路徑顏色+整合旅行時間駕駛者擁有較佳的正面決策比例。在無時間壓力且
僅能以主觀判斷時，駕駛者希望獲得更多充足的訊息以輔助決策，此時資訊組合

Summary: Variable message signs (VMS) is an important traffic 
control device for increasing road utility and decreasing traffic 
accidents. This study investigated the effects of Chinese font style (Hei, 
Ming, and Kai) and font color (red, green, and yellow) of VMS on 
subjects’ response performance (response time and accuracy) through 
an ergonomic viewpoint. Computer generated VMS stimuli merged 
with a driver’s view driving video, were projected onto a screen while 
subjects were making proper responses. The results showed that 
Chinese font style and font color both were significant factors for 
subjects’ response performance. Subjects took less response time for 
Hei style than for Kai and Ming styles, and exhibited higher accuracy 
for Hei and Ming styles than for Kai style. Subjects responded faster 
and more correct for yellow and green font colors than for red color. 
Additionally, the interaction of font style and font color also had a 
significant effect on subjects’ response performance. Response times 
for yellow and green colors were shorter than for red color on each 
font style. Subjects had the longest time for Ming style at red color 
while they had the least correct for Kai style at red color. The results 
from this study may assist in adopting appropriate Chinese font and 
color on VMS and in improving safe and efficient driving for motorists 
on freeway.        
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Variable message signs are programmable traffic control devices that display dynamic 
messages composed of letters, symbols, or both about road information. The 
information displayed on VMS can come from a variety of traffic monitoring and

results obtained from studies of English information display on VMS may not be 
applicable to Chinese VMS information display. Therefore, the major objective of this 
study was to investigate the effects of Chinese font style and font color of VMS on 
subjects’ response performance. 
METHOD 
 
Subjects 
Twenty-four college students (12 female and 12 male) who were between 18 and 30 
years old (M=24, SD=2.14) participated in the experiment. All had 0.8 corrected 
visual acuity or better and normal color vision. Each subject has a driver’s license and 
has driving experiences on freeway. They were paid for their participation. 
Stimuli and Apparatus  
The stimuli used in this study were composed of a sequence of computer-generated 
VMS merged with a real drivers’ view video representing freeway driving at 100 km 
per hour. Four messages were displayed on VMS concurrently. Each stimulus used 
black as the background color and with a different combination of font style and font 
color. Table 1 shows the contents of four messages on VMS and their associated 
response mode via wheel and pedal.

A Topcon Screenscope SS-3 was used to test subjects’ visual acuity and color vision. 
The CIE color values were measured with a Minolta color analyzer CA-100. A P4-2.4 
PC with 1G ram was used to process the experimental task program to the subjects. A 
Microsoft side winder force feedback wheel, replacing the steering wheel, was 
installed in front of the driver’s seat of a refitted used car in the ergonomic laboratory. 
The stimuli were projected on a screen (290 cm wide × 200 cm high) through an 
EPSON EMP-730 projector. 
 
Experimental Design 
 
The independent variables were the Chinese font style and font color. There were 
three styles of font: Hei, Kai, and Ming. They are all widely used in Chinese textual 
displays. Illustrations of the three font type are shown in Table 2. Red, green, and 
yellow were used for the variable of font color. A within-subjects design was 
conducted. Nine treatment groups represented the combinations of the two

Performance Measure and Data Analysis 
 
Response time and correct percentage were collected in this experiment. Response 
time was the time between the presentation of a VMS stimulus and the subjects’ 
correct response to the message. Correct percentage was 100 times the number of 
VMS correctly response divided by the total number of VMS. Analysis of variances 
(ANOVA) was conducted on the dependent measures. The factors that were 
significant were further analyzed using Tukey grouping method to discuss the 
different among the factor levels. All statistical analyses were made with the 
Statistical Analysis System (SAS). 
 
RESULTS 
Response Time  
 
The results of the analysis of variances on font style and font color showed that the 
main effect of font style was significant (F(2, 46)=162.15, p<0.01). While the font 
styles were Hei, Ming, and Kai, the mean response time was 4.7618, 5.3503, and 
5.1713 sec. respectively. The results of Tukey multiple-test demonstrated that Hei 
style was significantly different from Kai and Ming styles.  
 
The results of the analysis of variances also showed that the main effects of font color 
( F(2,46)=544.93, p<0.01) was significant. The mean response times were 5.8022, 
4.8037, and 4.6775 sec. respectively while the font colors were red, green, and yellow. 
The results of Tukey multiple-test demonstrated that the font color group of yellow 
and green was significantly different from the color of red.  
 
The results of the analysis of variances showed that the interaction of font type and 
font color has a significant effect on response time (F(4, 92)=3.77, p<0.01). Figure 2 
showed that response times for green and yellow colors were shorter than for red 
color at each font styles. Subjects took the shortest time for Hei style at yellow and 
green color, while they took the longest time for Ming style at red color.

92)=49.87, p<0.01) were all significant. Subjects responded less correct (87.67%) for 
Kai style than did subjects for Hei style (96.87%) and Ming style (96.27%). The

Interaction of Style and Color 
 
The result of the analysis of variance also showed that the interaction of font style and 
font color had a significant effect on subjects’ response time and accuracy. Response 
times for green and yellow colors were shorter than for red color on each font styles. 
Subjects took the longest time for Ming style at red color, and they responded the 
least correct for Kai style at red color. Considering the main effect of font style and 
font color together, the combination of Hei style at yellow color, or Hei style at green 
color could be the better choice for the Chinese VMS display. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The major objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Chinese font style 
and font color on variable message signs display. The study showed that font style, 
font color and their interaction all had significant effect on subjects’ response time and 
accuracy. Subject responded faster for Hei style than for Kai and Ming styles. The 
correct percentage was greater for Hei and Ming styles than for Kai style. Subjects 
also responded faster and more correct for yellow and green colors than for red color 
on each font style. In conclusion, Hei style with yellow or green color could be better 
for Chinese VMS display. However, the results of this experimental study for font 
color is different from the other questionnaire survey, further studies should be 
considered.

DRIVERS’ COMPREHENSION OF TRAFFIC INFORMATION 
ON CHANGEABLE GRAPHICAL SIGNS

ABSTRACT. The main objective of this study was to design and undertake 
laboratory research to examine whether the content of traffic information displayed by 
the changeable graphical sign (CGS), also called the graphical route information panel 
(GRIP), could be readily understood using a simple driving simulator. Eight signs 
composed of different networks (triangle and tetragon) and changeable information 
(road color, road color with driving speed, road color with journey time, and road 
color with integrated journey time) were proposed and tested in the experiment. 
Computer generated CGS merged with a driver’s view video was projected onto a 
screen in front of the test vehicle. Participants were asked to respond to CGS 
information by their free will. The results showed the response time for triangle road 
network was shorter than for tetragon road network. Percentage of participants’ 
optimum route choice for triangle road network was also higher than the tetragon 
road network. Response times for road color and road color with journey time were 
shorter than for road color with driving speed and road color with integrated journey 
time. Participants’ optimum route choice percentage for the road color with driving 
speed was less than for the other information combinations.

CGSs have been used in Japan for some time, and within Europe, the concept is also 
now becoming increasingly popular. For instance, in the Netherlands, prototypes of 
graphical panels have been developed with implementation expected in the future and 
in Germany, a pilot scheme has been in operation since April 2003 (Richards et al., 
2005). A graphical panel was prototyped in an off-road experiment as part of a project 
in France, and Atkins transport systems were commissioned by the Highways Agency 
to undertake a concept study into graphical congestion display panel in England 
(England Highway Agency, 2003). However, available literature on the design of 
CGSs is rare, and therefore it is worthwhile to design the CGS and evaluate the effect 
of motorists’ comprehension of them. The main objective of this study was to design 
and undertake laboratory research to examine whether the content of traffic 
information displayed by the CGS could be readily understood using a simple driving 
simulator. 
 
METHODS 
 
Experiment Design 
 
A driving simulator was used to examine whether the content of traffic information 
displayed by CGS could be readily understood. The type of road network and content 
of changeable information were treated as independent variables. There were two 
types of road network: triangle and tetragon. They are all widely seen on the highway 
system in Taiwan. The content of changeable information includes four levels: road 
with color only, color with driving speed, color with journey time, and color with 
integrated journey time. Illustrations of the two road networks with various 
changeable information are shown in Table 1. 
A within-subjects design was conducted in the experiment. Eight treatment groups 
represented the combinations of the two within-subjects factors of road network and 
changeable information. Each participant went through 24 randomized CGS 
presentations, that is, 8 CGS (shown in Table 1) with 3 different response choice in 
each test.  
 
Participants 
 
Sixteen college students (8 female and 8 male) between 20 and 29 years old (M=24, 
SD=2.6) participated in the experiment. All had 0.8 corrected visual acuity or better 
and normal color vision. Each participant had a valid driver’s license and driving 
experience on the freeway for at least one year. They were paid for their participation.

Task and Procedure 
 
A test participant, sitting in the driver’s seat of a refitted used car, would see the 
driving video on the screen with CGS stimuli appearing on the road center gradually 
increaseing in size. The time allowed for each CGS presentation was 20 seconds and 
would end when a response was made during the presentation. Before the presentation 
of a CGS stimuli, an instruction message related to the destination would appear. 
Participants were asked to choose a route according to the destination by their free 
will. After a response was made, the CGS stimuli disappeared, and the next 
instruction and stimuli would appear after a random lapse between 0 and 15 seconds. 
Each participant was instructed to respond by turning the steering wheel with his or 
her hand or by pressing the pedal with foot to signify her or his route choice for a 
specific message during each trial. Three response modes were designed to match the 
alternative route choice for different type of CGS. Participants’ response times and 
route choice were recorded by the computer automatically. Figure 2 shows the 
experimental task configuration. Table 2 shows an example of the three kinds of 
different CGSs with associated optimum response mode.

The means and standard deviations of response time and optimum route choice 
percentage under each level of the independent variables are shown in Table 3. The 
results of the analysis of variance for each measure are separately presented below.  
 
Optimum Route Choice Percentage 
 
The analysis of variances presented in Table 4 shows that the content of changeable 
information ( F(3, 45)=7.31, p<0.01) and type of road network ( F(1, 15)=5.12, 
p<0.05) were all significant. Participants responded more correctly for the triangle 
road network (75%) than for the tetragon road network (66.15%). The percentage of 
optimum route choice for road color with driving speed (54.17%) was less than for 
the other contents of changeable information. The results of Duncan multiple-test 
demonstrated road color with driving speed significantly differed from the other 
groups.

CONCLUSIONS 
 
The main objective of this study was to examine drivers’ comprehension of traffic 
information on changeable graphical signs. The results showed participants had 
higher optimum route choice percentage and less response time for the triangle road 
network than for the tetragon road network. CGS with road color had the greatest 
optimum route choice percentage and the fastest response time compared to the other 
contents. Considering drivers’ comprehension and response, using colour to present 
the traffic condition on CGS may be a suitable method. CGS with journey time is also 
recommended. CGS with driving speed and CGS with integrated journey time had the 
greatest response time and the least optimum route choice percentage. They were not 
suitable for the information presented on the changeable information panel.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Due to rapid developing electronic technology and the increasing need to convey more 
information to motorists, variable message signs (VMS) have recently been widely 
installed on traffic arteries in Taiwan. VMS are programmable traffic control devices 
that display dynamic message composed mainly of text about road information. It is 
critical in informing motorists of various situations, especially in high volume traffic 
and congested zones. However, the amount of text which can be displayed is limited. 
Therefore a VMS can not always present all relevant information to motorists at a 
certain location. The multitude of different routes existing in a road network would 
require directing different route recommendations at drivers with various destinations. 
Using signs to display graphical information may be a possible solution for this problem.  
In Taiwan, the National Freeway Bureau has been researching the use of Changeable 
Graphical Signs (CGSs) to display real-time congestion and journey time information 
relevant to drivers on sections of the trunk road network (Http://www.freeway.gov.tw). 
A CGS can be has various names, such as GCDP (Graphical Congestion Display Panels) 
in the UK, or GRIP (Graphical Route Information Panel) in the Netherlands.  
 
One picture is worth a thousand words. By displaying part of a road network, including 
the location of congestion, an overview of the current traffic situation can be given. The 
potential of the human mind to absorb graphical information is a distinct advantage for 
a CGS over a VMS which can display text message only. A CGS can display 
information regarding different routes simultaneously. Because the road network is 
displayed, including the locations of congestion, motorists receive information on all 
possible routes, regardless of their destination. This can be important when the network 
is complex or when congestion occurs on several locations within the network.  
 
CGSs also serve a larger group of motorists, and particularly motorists who are not 
familiar with the roadways will have fewer problems. They will not need to know what 
the descriptive terms on text VMSs stand for. With the advantages of CGSs, there are 
also disadvantages. Research has not shown our intake limit of graphical information, 
and how complex the CGSs can be for the motorist while negotiating an everyday road 
situation. A network that is displayed graphically must be simple and recognizable. So, 
the critical factor is to find the right balance between recognition and simplicity (Alkim 
et al., 2000) 
 
CGSs have been used in Japan for some time, and within Europe, the concept is also 
now becoming increasingly popular. For instance, in the Netherlands, prototypes of

Apparatus and Stimuli 
 
A Topcon Screenscope SS-3 was used to test participants’ visual acuity and color vision. 
A P4-2.4 PC with 1G ram was used to process the experimental task program for the 
participants. A Microsoft side winder force feedback wheel, replacing the steering wheel, 
was installed in front of the driver’s seat of a refitted used car in the ergonomic 
laboratory. The stimuli were projected on a screen (149 cm wide × 200 cm high) 
through a MITSUBISHI XL9U projector. 
 
The stimuli used in this study were composed of a sequence of computer-generated 
CGS merged with a real drivers’ view video representing freeway driving at 100 km per 
hour. The CGS panel used green color for the background, red for heavy congestion 
road section, yellow for light congestion section, and black for normal conditions. 
Driving speed and journey time were designed in accordance with the color displayed 
on each CGS.  Four kinds of changeable information combination for each road 
network type were selected as the stimulus in the experiment. Figure 1 is an example of 
a CGS for tetragon network merged with the scene of the driving environment.

Before starting the experiment, each participant was briefed on the purpose and 
procedures of the experiment. To prevent visual fatigue, participants were asked not to 
do any reading tasks for an hour before the experiment. A warm up session was 
conducted in the beginning to familiarize participants with the response task. With the 
participants’ consent, the actual experiment began. The complete experiment took about 
half an hour. 
 
Performance Measure and Data Analysis 
 
The dependent measures collected in this experiment were response time and optimum 
route choice percentage. Response time was the time between the start of presentation 
of a CGS stimuli and the moment of a participant’s response to the information of the 
CGS. Optimum route choice percentage was 100 times the number of optimum 
responses divided by the total number of responses. The optimum response is the choice 
to the fastest route among all alternatives. Analysis of variances (ANOVA) was 
conducted for each of the two dependent measures. The factors that were significant 
were further analyzed using multiple test to discuss the differences among the factor 
levels. All statistical analyses were done with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The interaction of content of changeable information and type of road network also had 
a significant effect on optimum route choice percentage ( F(3, 45)=6.85, p<0.01). Figure 
3 shows the optimum route choice percentage of road color with driving speed for the 
tetragon road network was less than for the triangle road network while there were no 
significant differences for the other information contents.

the contents of changeable information ( F(3, 45)=4.25, p<0.01), road network ( F(1, 
15)=20.92, p<0.01) were all significant. Participants responded more quickly for the 
triangle network (15.474 sec.) than for the tetragon network (16.510 sec.). Participants 
responded more quickly for the road color (15.468 sec.) than participants for the other 
contents of changeable information. The results of Duncan multiple-test  demonstrated 
response times for road color and for road color with driving speed were significantly 
different from the other two groups. The interaction of content of changeable 
information and type of road network had no significant effect on response time. Figure 
4 showed response time for triangle road network was less than tetragon road network 
at all levels of changeable information.

(Dudek and Ullman, 2002). There are basic difference in the type of road network and 
number of information units, which clearly influence the response time and optimum 
route choice for the information of CGS. The basic principle of information theory 
points out that choice reaction is a linear function of stimulus information (Hyman, 
1953). The amount of information units for the triangle road network is less than for the 
tetragon road. Participants should interpret and respond to the information for the 
triangle road  network more quickly. 
 
The results also showed the content of changeable information significantly affected 
participants’ response time and optimum route choice percentage. CGS with road color 
had the greatest optimum route choice percentage and the fastest response time 
compared to the other contents of changeable information. On the contrary, CGS with 
driving speed had the greatest response time and the least optimum route choice 
percentage. Response times for CGS with driving speed and for CGS with integrated 
journey time were significantly slower than the other two groups. Familiarity with color 
codes and less information units for CGS with color codes should explain these effects. 
Color codes were better for identification task than were certain other codes (Christ, 
1975; Sanders and McCormick, 1993). The amount of information units for road color 
was also less than the other three contents of changeable information. Besides, journey 
time is the main factor for drivers to choose a route. Participants need further 
calculation and interpretation of the CGS information with driving speed to decide their 
route choice.  
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The main objective of this study was to examine drivers’ comprehension of traffic 
information on changeable graphical signs. The results showed participants had higher 
optimum route choice percentage and less response time for the triangle road network 
than for the tetragon road network. CGS with road color had the greatest optimum route 
choice percentage and the fastest response time compared to the other contents. 
Considering drivers’ comprehension and response, using colour to present the traffic 
condition on CGS may be a suitable method. CGS with journey time is also 
recommended. CGS with driving speed and CGS with integrated journey time had the 
greatest response time and the least optimum route choice percentage. They were not 
suitable for the information presented on the changeable information panel.
