英文摘要 
The shift toward very deep sub-micron 
processing technology has encouraged IC 
designers to design an entire system 
implemented on a single chip. This new 
paradigm, system on a chip (SOC), has changed 
design methodologies. In order to reduce 
time-to-market, reuse-based and IP-based design 
methodologies have become a major concern in 
IC industries. Therefore, IP identification and 
protection techniques become more and more 
important. A complete digital right management 
(DRM) platform for IP identification and 
protection can help IC design industry establish 
fair trade market. 
In this project, we developed a 
watermarked-based IP protection and 
identification technique to protect IP at behavior 
design level, logic design level, and physical 
design level. After synthesis, placement, routing, 
packaged, any IP in the chip may be observed 
and tested. In test mode, the selected IP sends 
output test patterns and watermark sequences. 
We can determine the identity of the IP provider 
according to the watermark sequence. 
A set of experiments has been performed to 
verify the quality of this proposed procedure. We 
applied our method to five industry IP cores. 
According to the results, the proposed methods 
have low hardware costs (no more than 5%), low 
processing time costs, low tracking costs, and 
high fault coverage (between 90% and 96%). 
The watermark generating circuit is invisible at 
the gate and physical design levels without 
impairing the normal function. 
The proposed method can prove the identity 
after the IP has been integrated into a whole and 
packaged, without examination of its 
microphotograph. Moreover, we can also 
identify the soft IP core at various design levels 
even after logic synthesis, placement and routing. 
The experimental results demonstrate that the 
proposed techniques are feasible and efficient. 
 
三、 研究方法 
A novel digital rights management system 
is developed for software IP in SoC design [31].  
First of all, an IP identification code is designed. 
The IP identification code is divided into two 
parts, including general identification (Fig. 1(a)) 
and secure identification (Fig. 1(b)). The general 
identification component contains the IP number, 
IP design company, version, manufacturing 
information, and check bit. This information is 
open. The function of the general identification 
component is similar to that of visible 
watermarking. The customer, IP provider, or 
designer can check the general identification 
during the whole chip design or after the chip 
has been packaged. Secure identification 
contains the fingerprinting sequence, the 
designer’s check bit. This information is secret 
and mixed in the test pattern. The customer is 
unaware of this secure identification information. 
The DRM system provides authorization to the 
customer according to the secure identification. 
The embedding procedure has been introduced 
previously [19-23,32]. We can adopt the five 
watermark embedding methods as fellows [32].  
1) Headed Watermark Sequence Method: A 
chip sends out the watermark sequence first and 
sends out the test patterns later [32].  
2) Periodic Watermark Sequence Method: 
A chip sends out the watermark sequence and 
the test patterns periodically [32].  
3) Cyclic Redundancy Watermark 
Sequence Method: A chip sends n-bit output test 
patterns and one bit watermark data alternately. 
The watermark sequence and output test patterns 
thus appear cyclically [32]. 
4) Random Watermark Sequence Method: 
A chip sends the watermark data according to 
the pseudorandom sequence in order [32].  
5) Operational Watermark Sequence 
Method: A chip performs exclusive-or (XOR) 
operations on the watermark sequence and 
output test patterns to send the new patterns [32].   
Combining the watermarking method has 
several benefits [32]. This method has high fault 
coverage, low processing time costs, low 
tracking costs, and low hardware costs. The 
embedded circuit is invisible at the behavior, 
login and physical design levels. The scheme can 
prove the identity after the IP has been integrated 
into a whole and packaged. Therefore, we do not 
need to examine its microphotograph. Besides, 
the soft IP core can be identified at various 
design levels even after logic synthesis, 
placement and routing without impairing the 
normal function [32]. 
When an IP vendor (or design service) sells 
the IP, the vendor adds a fingerprint into each IP. 
When the IP is distributed, the DRM system can 
still trace the IP. Because the secure 
identification is mixed into the test pattern, it is 
difficult to discover the secure identification 
[31]. 
After the IP identification code is designed, 
the IP release DRM model can be established 
according to the identification. The model 
describes the relations between IP vendor, EDA 
vendor, customer, foundry, and designer (Fig. 2). 
Figures 3 and 4 indicate the details of the IP 
release DRM model according the different roles. 
Figure 3 focuses on the relations between IP 
vendor, designer, and EDA vendor. Figure 4 
focuses on the relations between customer and 
IP vendor. 
are finished, the customer will tape out the chip. 
The IP vendor provides the real IP layout to the 
foundry. Then the chip with the IP-based design 
is finished [31]. 
The proposed DRM system has some important 
features: 
1)  It enables intellectual property rights. 
2)  It protects intellectual property (IP) 
under a DRM system. 
3)  It supports online ownership protection 
and verification. 
4)  It supports various hardware 
description languages. 
5)  Only legal customers can license the 
IP.  
6)  The usage of the IP can be tracked.  
7)  It uses a watermarking identification, 
public key encrypted system, private key   
and LAN card number for DRM system. 
8)  It provides a total solution for the IP 
release DRM model.  
9)  It locates where the distributed IP is 
and who is using the IP content. 
    Our research group published 5 
international journal papers [32, 35-38] (4 
IEEE, 1 CSSP), 14 conference papers 
[44-57]，2 U.S. patents [39,43]，and 3 R.O.C. 
patents [40-42] in this NSC project. 
 
四、計畫成果比較 
We compare our method with previous 
schemes. Several techniques have been proposed 
for IP identification and protection in the 
literature [3, 4, 6, 12-15, 17, 18, 25-27]. These 
methods all adopt IP watermarking techniques. 
However, a DRM system for SoC/VLSI IP 
identification and protection has yet to be 
proposed to support a fair IP trade model. 
Different scenarios and different design 
methodologies are adopted to enable IP business. 
Table 2 compares several famous IP 
watermarking techniques [3, 4, 6, 12-15, 17, 18, 
25-27]. There are four main watermarking 
schemes discussed in the open literature: 
constraint-based watermarking, finite state 
machine-based watermarking, digital signal 
processing watermarking, and the Joint Test 
Action Group (JTAG) identified method.  
The constraint-based IP watermarking methods 
are presented by Kirovski and Kahng. [9][28]. 
They proposed combinational logic synthesis [5] 
and design partitioning [10][29] watermarking 
schemes for intellectual property protection (IPP) 
at different design levels [11]. The approaches 
have low overhead. However, these techniques 
cannot be detected except at the same level of 
abstraction [30]. Besides, the designer must 
examine the photomicrograph to check the 
ownership rights after the chip has been 
packaged. Another consideration is that 
imposing extra-constraints during the design 
procedure will not be as successful as presumed 
by the users [30].  
Torunoglu and Oliveira [12][13] proposed finite 
state machine (FSM) IP watermarking. This 
method can detect the watermark at lower design 
levels [30]. Moreover, the user encounters 
difficulty in tracking the FSM function when the 
IP is integrated into a whole chip. After the chip 
has been packaged, the watermark is hidden in 
the SOC; the ownership rights are not easy to 
prove. 
Chapman and Durrani [14][15] presented a 
digital signal processing (DSP) watermarking 
scheme. This approach has a low data rate. 
However, the approach does not provide a clear 
way to track and extract the watermark at lower 
levels [30]. The watermark must be designed 
case-by-case according to the characteristics of 
various IPs and hence is not convenient.       
Besides, Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) 
P1149.1 and P1500 (Testing Standard) describe 
some controller instructions. One instruction is 
USERCODE Instruction. The USERCODE 
Instruction is intended for user-programmable 
components, such as field-programmable gate 
arrays (FPGAs) and electrically erasable and 
programmable ROMs (EEPROMs). The 
USERCODE instruction allows an external 
tester to determine the user programming of a 
programmable component. This is necessary 
because a user-programmable component can be 
personalized to act like an arbitrary large number 
of different devices, so the USERCODE 
instruction reads out the register indicating 
which programming is present in the 
programmable device. The USERCODE 
instruction selects the device identification 
register to be serially connected between JTAG

15:45~17:30：這段時間進行 Tutorial，由 Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany的 N.
Stefanoski與 J. Ostermann及 University of West Bohemia, Plzen, Chech Republic的 L. Vasa為我
們介紹「Compression of 3D Meshes–Applications, Approaches, Standards」，簡述 3D Meshes的
建構，並針對靜態及動態的 3D Meshes使用不同的壓縮技術，最後介紹對於動態 3D Meshes
的MPEG標準，經由三位前輩的精采演說，令人印象深刻。
Tutorial結束後，接著是Conference所辦的Conference Welcome Reception，在這個Welcome
Reception中，認識了一些與會的教授與研究生，在相互討論的過程中，無形中增廣許多見聞。
會議第二天，計有四個時段的報告：
9:00~10:00：這段時間進行 Keynote Speech，由 University of Connecticut, USA的 B. Javidi
為我們介紹「Three Dimensional Sensing, Visualization, and Display」，對於近年來在 3D
Sensing、Holographic Imaging與 Image Recognition領域進行綜觀性的簡介，收穫良多。
10:15~11:55：這段時間共計五場報告，同時間舉辦，我選擇了「GPU-based Image
Processing」參加，這場 Session分別是「Boosting The Level of Immersion: Integrating Stereoscopic
Output Into Interactive Audiovisual Applications」、「GPU-based 3D Video Object Synthesis and Its
Quality Assessment」、「OpenGL-based Control of Semi-active 3D Display」、「A Scalable
