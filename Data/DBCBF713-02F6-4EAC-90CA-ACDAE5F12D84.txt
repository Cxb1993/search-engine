Figure 1: Schematics of the prototype of the thermoacoustic device.
The amplitude of the acoustic wave together with the temperature gradient of the plates determines whether the
thermoacoustic engine is a prime mover or a heat pump. During the compressional half cycle of the acoustic standing
wave, the gas parcel is both heated up and displaced from its equilibrium position. Two temperatures are very
important to the irreversible heat transport between the gas parcel and the plates: the temperature T cg of the gas
parcel after adiabatic compressional heating and the temperature T cp of the part of the plate in contact with the gas
parcel after compression and displacement. See Figure 2. If T cg > T
c
p , then heat will flow from the gas to the plates.
If T cg < T

p , then heat will flow in the opposite direction. For the purpose of long-term operation, we select proper

plate material that has a large enough heat capacity per unit area so that its temperature does not change appreciably
at the acoustic frequency. On the other hand, the gas parcel is cooled down during the next half cycle of adiabatic
expansion. Again, two temperatures are important to the irreversible heat transport: the temperature T eg of the gas
parcel after adiabatic expansion and the temperature T ep of the part of the plate in contact with the gas parcel after
expansion and displacement. If T eg < T

way below the sound pressure levels ( ≥ 140 dB) required for significant thermoacoustic effect. Hence we are forced
to search/design the actuators that can generate the required SPL.
Two promising candidates are identified: the stacked PZT actuators and a buzzer made of bronze/PZT bimorph.
Currently, we purchased a stacked PZT actuator that is capable of making 30 µm stroke with a natural frequency of
14 kHz. Unfortunately, the power amplification of the controller came with the stacked PZT actuator is limited by
its low bandwidth (1kHz). A high-frequency power amplifier is needed for the actuation of the stacked PZT actuator
above 1 kHz. Consequently, we have requested the acquisition of this equipment in the budget of the proposal of
this coming year and the PI do appreciate the approval of the acquisition of this equipment from NSC. The second
candidate is a buzzer made of bronze/PZT bimorph driven at its natural frequency, 2.8 kHz.
In order to further amplify the sound wave, the length of the acoustic chamber is designed to reflect the acosutic
wave at its closed end to form the standing waves and amplify the sound waves via resonance. The buzzer within the
resonance tube can generate a sound wave at 2.8 kHz with a SPL of 154 dB, which is expected to be loud enough for
significant thermoacoustic effect.
2.2 Thermoacoustic Stack
The stack plates are critical to the success of thermoacoustic devices. The selection of material of the stack plates
depends on the function of the thermoacosutic devices. If the device is a prime mover, then the conductivity of
the stack plates should be as large as possible. On the other hand if the device is a heat pump, the conductivity
of the stack plates should be the smaller the better. Currently, we focus our attention on the construction of a
thermoacoustic refrigerator. Hence we choose Mylar (low conductivity, high heat capacity) as stack plates.
Theoretically, The best gap width between plates is about four times of the thermal penetration depth associated
with the acoustic waves. This requires a gap width of 100–400 µm. The length of the stack plates should not be
longer than a quarter of the wavelength of the acoustic wave. Limited by difficulties in fabricating stack plates with
small gap width, we fabricated 4 stack plates with gap widths of 200µm and 350µm and 0.5cm and 1.0cm in length,
respectively.
2.3 Pressure Measurement
To characterize the acoustic pressure produced by the actuators (buzzers or PZT actuators), high-frequency pressure
sensors are critical for this experiment. As mentioned earlier the amplitude of the acoustic pressure must be larger
than 160dB (relative to 20µPa.) for significant thermoacoustic effect, an ICP pressure sensor (PCB 106B52) with a
measurement range of 6.89kPa (±5V output) and a sensitivity of 725mV/kPa is selected.
The pressure sensor is put at the fixed end of the acoustic chamber to avoid possible interference with the acoustic
standing wave.
2.4 Temperature Measurement
Two temperature measurements are the major indices for the performance of thermoacoustic effects: the temperature
difference between the two ends of stack plates and the mean temperature inside and outside the acoustic chamber.
Due to the size constraints, thermocouples are used to measure the temperature differences along the stacks created
by the thermoacoustic effect. Since the temerature differences are much less than 10K for our experiments, T-type
low temperature thermocouples are used. The voltage outputs from T-type thermocouples are usually at the order of
several tens of µV/K. In addition, the noise due to capacitance pickup may cause a temperature fluctuation of 0.5–1K,
which may obscure the temperature differences produced by thermoacoustic effect. Therefore, signal conditioning is
essential to the temperature measurement. To eliminate the 60Hz noise coming from the power supply, a low pass
filter with bandwidth of 3Hz is added. Cold junction compensation is achieved by putting an AD592 IC near the
cold junction, which outputs a current of 1 µA/K proportional to the absoulte temperature under consideration.
Unfortunately, the NIST thermocouple calibration tables are usually given in one degree increments referenced to
0◦C instead of 0K. A zero point correction for the over-compensated voltage excess due to the temperature difference
between 0◦C and 0K must be taken into account. Signal is amplified by non-inverting amplification. OP amplifers
with low offset drift such as PMI OP-07 are critical for high accuracy. A simple circuit devised to perform proper
signal conditioning for current experiment is shown in Figure 4. Two signal conditioners are fabricated and carefully
calibrated.
In order to measure the mean temperature inside and outside the acoustic chamber, two SOIC AD22100 monolithic
temperature sensors with on-chip signal conditioning are deployed inside and outside the chamber. The output voltage
of AD22100 is proportional to the temperature and the supply voltage. Due to the ratiometric nature, the AD22100
provides a cost-effective solution for measuring the ambient air temperature.

of the pressure distribution inside the resonance tube is difficult to achieve because of the size of the pressure sensor.
Therefore, we design a sliding tube that can slide along the center line of the resonance tube to host the pressure
sensor. The pressure distribution inside the resonance tube is shown in Figure 6. As can be seen from the figure,
we know that the measurement of pressure near the buzzer is severly distored by the back scattering of the waves
incident on the pressure sensor. However, we can still identify the pressure node clearly.

Pressure distribution along the resonance tube

frequency.
To characterize the performance of the prototype, we position the leading edge of the stack plates (1cm×3cm2.5cm)
at a distance of 1cm away from the buzzer and vary the amplitudes of the acoustic waves. Time histories of the
temperature differences between the two ends of various stack plates are shown in Figure 7. Clearly, the system reaches
steady state within two minutes. The results of the temperature differences versus the amplitudes of acoustic waves
are briefly summarized in Figure 8. Obviously, the temperature differences increase with the increasing amplitudes of
the acoustic waves. A maximum temperature difference of 2oC between the two ends of the stack plates is achieved
for the stack plates with a gap width of 200µm and a length of 1cm.
4 Conclusions
A prototype thermoacoustic device is constructed and its performance is characterized. A maximum temperature
difference of 2oC between the two ends of the stack plates is achieved for the stack plates with a gap width of 200µm
and a length of 1cm. This temperature difference may not be as promising as we expected. On a second thought, the
temperature gradient is around 200oC/m, which is quite promising if we can further downsize the device. Currently,
the performance is limited by the amplitude of the acoustic pressure and the difficulties in fabricating stack plates
with small gap width. The first problem can be easily resolved by using a high-frequency power amplifier to drive the
PZT stack actuator, which is undergoing now. The fabrication of stack plates with small gap width may be solved
by using the microfabrication technology in clean room. This is currently under design stage. We expect a very
promising thermoacoustic device in this coming year.
