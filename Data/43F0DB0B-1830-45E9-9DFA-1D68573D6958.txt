defined by the selection parameter σ; 20 /2 RVd tασ = , where α  is the thermal diffusivity and 
0d  the capillary length. The selection parameter σ is only affected by the anisotropic strength ε, 
which is a material property. Also, the anisotropic strength ε plays a critical role in the selection. 
Without it, the dendrite cannot be selected and grown. The extension of the microscopic 
solvability theory from diffusive to convective growth was given by Bouissou and Pelce [4]. 
They applied Oseen flow to develop a relation between tip growth speed and the flow strength, 
the so-called Oseen-Ivantsov solution, but it is 2D. Therefore, the classic solutions give only the 
growth operation state of a dendrite. The details of the morphological development of a dendrite 
growth require a complete time-dependent numerical solution of the Stefan problem coupled with 
fluid flow and heat transfer. This is extremely challenging especially for 3D simulation using a 
front tracking method, because of the complex dendrite morphology and the different length and 
time scales for the interface, heat, and momentum transports.  
In recent years, the phase-field model has emerged as a powerful tool for the simulation of 
solidification with complicated morphologies. In contrast to the front tracking method, the phase 
field model introduces a continuous phase-field variable φ  to describe the interface through a 
rapid transition function. Nevertheless, the diffusive interface approach does not warrant a proper 
approximation for the Stefan problem with a shape interface unless the interface diffusion length 
δ is near the capillary one 0d . The thin and semi-sharp interface models developed by Karma 
and Rappel [5-8] and Amberg [9] greatly relax the requirement of the diffusive interface 
thickness, where the interface thickness is allowed be about one tenth of the tip radius. Even so, 
the simulation of a complex dendrite with a reasonable resolution, while covering the length 
scales of flow and heat transfer, is still not feasible by using a uniform mesh. Especially, for low 
supercooling, the computational domain needs to be large enough to avoid the boundary effect. 
To overcome this, an adaptive grid, with dynamic mesh refining and coarsening, during 
simulation is required for an efficient simulation.  
For 2D adaptive phase filed simulation, some progress has been made by Provotas et al. [10] 
for diffusive growth and Lan et al. [11] for convective growth. The use of a large domain, Lan et 
al. [12] have simulated the dendritic growth under a forced flow with various supercolings. Good 
agreement with Oseen-Ivantsov solution has been obtained, if the global tip radius is adopted. 
Recently, Jeong et al. [13-14] have developed a 3D adaptive parallel finite-element code to 
simulate the solidification of pure materials in a forced flow. The simulated result for low 
supercoolings was consistent with experimental results [15], but the growth did not reach the 
steady state. Lu et al. [16] have also simulated the 3D dendritic growth under forced convection, 
but using a two-mesh approach based on finite difference. Their results are in good agreement 
with the classic solution for the case of no convection. Although some scattered 3D results have 
been reported, the one-to-one comparison with 2D simulation has not yet been reported. The 
growth characteristics of a 3D dendrite in a forced flow have not yet well discussed, and the 
comparison with 2D cases should provide a deeper insight into the 3D heat flow structure and its 
effect on the dendrtic growth.  
In this paper, we present 2D and 3D adaptive phase field simulation using an efficient finite

2
0 /τρw , where ρ is the melt density; here, the melt and solid densities are assumed to be the 
same. In this study, we mainly focus on the dendritic growth in a uniform forced flow in the 
x-direction. In order to compare with the classic theory and previous calculations, the buoyancy 
convection due to gravity is neglected, even though it can be added easily in the source term of 
the momentum equation. The boundary conditions are straightforward for the above equations in 
the present simulation. The far field temperature is set at the supercooling,i.e. u=-∆, and the 
velocity is determined by the stress-free condition (in the y and z directions). The inlet velocity is 
given to be U* in the x direction, i.e., *** UeVV xx =•=

 the unit vector in the 
x-direction, and the outflow boundary condition is set by the overall mass balance, assuming that 
the melt is incompressible. 
 
2.2. Adaptive Finite Volume Method 
 
The above dimensionless equations and the associated boundary conditions are solved by an 
adaptive finite volume method. The numerical scheme is very similar to the 2D one we reported 
before [11-12]. To save space, the scheme is briefly described here. The adaptive finite volume 
method is first to divide the computational space into a number of finite volumes at grid level 0, 
i.e., the coarsest mesh. Then, with the need of computation, each volume (the parent cell) can be 
subdivided into eight (4 for a 2D cell) control volumes (kid cells), defined as the level-1 cells. 
The mesh refinement can continue by adding more levels to the mesh. Figure 1(a) shows three 
meshes at different simulation times. As shown, with the growth of the dendrite, the adaptive 
mesh refinement (AMR) continues according to the microstructures. 
 On the other hand, for the region losing the physical features, the cells are coarsened to the 
lower grid level. Constructing the data structure is straightforward by using pointers and derived 
data types of FORTRAN90. A detailed description of the adaptive data structure and a simple 
program can be found elsewhere [18]. 
With the Cartesian finite volume having a number of adjacent cells, as shown in Fig. 1(b), 
the discrete conservation of a physical quantity for each cell can be derived.  
where ξe  is a unit vector shown in Fig. 1(b).  
Further approximation for the time derivative is necessary and the implicit Euler scheme is 
adopted. Although a higher-order scheme can be used, it needs more memory and computation at 
each time step. Moreover, in the simulation of dendritic growth, the refined zone is very thin. 
Hence, the time step is restricted by the amount of interface movement such that the advancement 
of the new interface needs to be inside the refined zone. Therefore, since time step is small, the 
first-order Euler scheme is adequate. After assembling the flux balance equations for all cells and 
imposing the boundary conditions for the boundary cells, one can solve the nonlinear algebraic 
equations for each time step easily. Due to the incompressibility of the melt, the pressure does not 
appear explicitly in the equation of continuity. To prevent the checkerboard pressure oscillation, 
the SIMPLE [20] scheme and the momentum interpolation [21] are further adopted. In addition, 
the Gauss-Siedel method is used in the inner iterations for solving the linearized equations for all 
variables.  
 
2.3 Rescaling 
 
For comparison purposes, we pick a seed growth from a supercooled melt for simulation. If 
the domain is large enough, the far field temperature is set at the supercooling, i.e. u=-∆. Many 
experiments with such a configuration have been performed. Among these, Huang and 
Glicksman [15] gave the first comprehensive set of dendritic crystal growth experiments using 
succinonitrile (SCN). An interesting observation from their experiments is that the steady-state 
dendrite tip shape and structure are in self-similar manner. The tip structure approximates closely 
a paraboloid of revolution, exhibiting a constant steady-state tip radius R and speed V and good 
agreement with the Ivantsov solution [1] is found, i.e.,

where Pe is the growth Peclet number and Iv-1 the inverse Ivantsov function. The 
micro-solvability theory [2-3] further shows that an operation state for the dendrite growth with 
anisotropy is given by the stability constant σ:

where d0 is a capillary length [2]. For SCN, σ=0.0195~0.025; the parabolic front model gives 
σ=0.025, which has been widely used for SCN for giving a good agreement with the 
experimental measurements. For a given suercooling ∆, Eqs (3) and (4) give the steady-state tip 
radius and speed.  
 In the thin-interface model proposed by Karma and Rappel [2-3], when the kinetic effect is

3.2 Effects of forced flow 
 
The effect of forced flow on the 3D dendrite growth was investigated recently by Jeong et al. 
[13-14] and Lu et al. [16] using an adaptive finite element method and a two-grid finite difference 
method, respectively. In order to compare their results, two different cell sizes, 0.6 and 0.8, are 
considered in our finite volume method. The calculated tip velocity and the local tip radius for Δ
= 0.55 and ε4 = 0.05 are compared with previous ones and summarized in Table 2 for diffusive 
growth first. As shown, the difference with the previous results in the tip velocity is less than 10%. 
Bigger difference is found for the local tip radius.

Because the calculation error for the second derivative is usually large, such a difference for 
different numerical methods is believed to be reasonable. On the other hand, our comparison with 
the Ivontsov solution, as shown Fig. 3, is quite good using the global tip radius. 
Then, we can examine the effect of flow strength on the dendrite morphology. The simulated 
cross sections of the morphologies for U*= 0 and 1 are shown in Fig. 4; the simulation result by 
Jeong et al. [13-14] is put together for comparison; ∆= 0.55, ε= 0.05, Pr= 23.1. As shown, they 
are in good agreement. Some calculated values are summarized in Table 3, and the agreement is 
good as well. As shown in Fig. 4, the upstream growth is enhanced by the flow, while the 
downstream tip growth is suppressed by the flow.

=2; (d) U* =4. 
 
Indeed, with a stronger external flow field, the larger temperature gradients at the upstream 
are caused by the convective heat flow. This makes the upstream tip grows faster. Furthermore, 
from the 2D Oseen-Ivantsov solution, the growth Peclet number increases with the flow Peclet 
number, as shown in Fig. 3, and the 3D growth Peclet number shows a similar trend. The tip’s 
VtR product increases with the flow intensity U*.  
Again, at the downstream, the heat transfer was suppressed by the flow. Hence, the growth 
speed decreases with the flow intensity. It is clear that the downstream growth rate for U*=4 is 
much slower than that for U*= 1. Table 4 summarizes the tip speeds and tip radii under different 
flow intensities.

The streamlines and the dendrite morphology at U*= 4 are further illustrated in Fig. 6. As 
shown, with the convective flow, more side branches are induced and grow toward the upstream; 
the side branches grow from the side arms.

Near the upstream, the 3D temperature contours are much denser than 2D ones indicating 
much higher thermal gradients near the upstream arms. Since the fluid flows near the dendrite in 
the 2D dendrite must pass through the dendrite completely, the fluid near the transverse arm 
always comes from the upstream arm. It means that the fluid near the transverse arms is warmer 
due to the released heat of fusion during solidification, and thus having smaller temperature 
gradients. The 2D temperature contours show the largest temperature gradients appear at the 
upstream tip, and the temperature gradients decrease along the streamline around the crystal. On 
the contrary, the 3D temperature contours are always denser alone the crystal at the upstream. 
This is because the fluid near the transverse arm comes from the upstream directly. The flow 
comes to the dendrite tip can go either in the y direction or the z direction. Hence, the growth of 
The comparison of the growth Peclet number Pe vs supercooling ∆ with the Ivantsov 
solution is shown in Fig. 9. As shown, a good agreement is found except for high supercooling. 
Indeed, for high supercooling, the interfacial tension plays a critical role. For the Ivantsov 
solution, where the interfacial tension is neglected, the Peclet number approaches infinity at unity 
supercooling. Therefore, the discrepancy at high supercooling in Fig. 9 is anticipated. The 
simulated dendrite morphologies at ∆=0.01, 0.1, and 0.55 are also included in the figure for 
comparison. As shown, the morphologies for ∆=0.1 and 0.01 are quite similar. In fact, the side 
branches grown from 45o are quite affected by the dimensionless thermal diffusivity D* and the 
initial condition. According to the relations in Eq. (5), the interface thickness w0 is proportional to 
D* and the characteristic time constant τ0 is proportional to D*3. Therefore, the simulation using 
smaller D*, i.e., smaller w0, can give a more accurate result. However, the simulation time 
becomes much longer. According to the thin-interface model, w0~0.1R is good enough for 
simulation. Based on the comparison with the Ivantsov solution, we find that R*~7 seems to be 
adequate; R*=R/w0. Further reducing w0 dramatically increases the computation time, and the 
computer memory due to the increase of the number of control volumes (∆x=0.8w0). We believe 
that for fine structures having a smaller tip radius, the simulation requires a smaller w0 for a better 
resolution. Nevertheless, for the comparison of the primary arm with the experiments, the present 
selection seems to be good enough.

solution; the dendrite morphologies at ∆=0.01, 0.1, and 0.55 are inset in the figure. 
 
at low supercooling, the thermal boundary layer becomes large. In order to compare the 
experimental results and the classic solution, a large domain is needed for simulation at low 
supercooling. We also attach isotherms (z*=0) at ∆=0.01 and 0.55 in the inset of Fig. 10 for 
comparison. As shown, for ∆=0.01, the thermal boundary layer is much larger, as compared with 
 Fig.11 Comparison of the normalized dendrite tip shapes at various supercoolings. 
 
Chapter 4 Conclusion 
 
2D and 3D adaptive phase field simulations using a finite volume method are carried out for 
a dendritic growth in a forced flow. The simulated results have compared with the available 
classic solutions and simulated results, and good agreement is found. The effect of flow on the tip 
speed and radius, as well as the crystal morphology is investigated, and again they are consistent 
with the reported simulations and experiments. For the same flow intensity, the effect of flow on 
2D and 3D morphologies are also discussed. It is found that the side branches can be easily 
induced from the transversal arms in the 3D crystal. Apparently, the fundamental difference in the 
2D and 3D flow structures is the cause for such different growth morphologies. The 2D and 3D 
temperature fields near the upstream side of the crystal are also quite different. The thermal 
gradients remain about the same along the upstream surface of the 3D crystal, while they drop 
quickly along the 2D crystal as a result of the convective heat transport and the release of heat of 
fusion. The warmer surrounding in 2D along the transverse arms thus suppresses the growth of 
side branches from there. On the other hand, the direct cold fluid from the upstream induces side 
branches from the transversal arms for the 3D crystal. For the case with low undercooling, due to 
the much thicker thermal boundary layer, the side branching appears along the upstream arm and 
some on the upstream side of the transverse arms. This is consistent with the experimental 
observations. The simulated results are in good agreement with the Ivantsov solution, except at 
high supercooling, and thus the experimental results. The invariant dimensionless tip velocity and 
radius are found. Furthermore, the self-similar dendrite shapes at a wide range of supercoolings 
are consistent with the experimental observation.
