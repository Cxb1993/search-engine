ABSTRACT  
Run-to-run (RtR) control is an important quality assurance method for batch-based 
manufacturing process.  Usually, products of different grades are produced on a tool 
which will experience gradual drift between maintenance cycles. A 
feed-forward/feedback RtR control strategy that compensates this drift for all products 
manufactured on this tool was proposed.  This and other RtR control schemes were 
analyzed and validated by simulation and experimentally using a bench scale reactor that 
produces silica particles with different diameters by a sol-gel process.  A simple EWMA 
(Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) RtR control scheme based on products of the 
same grade was found to be stable but inefficient for infrequent products.  A simple 
EWMA RtR control scheme that attributed disturbance entirely as the effect of tool drift 
was found to be unstable.  The feed-forward/feedback RtR control proposed was able to 
maintain stable quality by effectively utilizing information about tool changes to adjust 
recipes of infrequent products.

runs are used to calibrate the condition of the tool. 
In actual practice, a tool usually exhibit significant drifts within a preventive 
maintenance cycle.  For example, in chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), pad 
conditioning immediately after a pad change and pad wear require that different polishing 
time be used[8],[9],[10].  It is desirable that a RtR control scheme be developed to 
effectively compensate such drifts while recognizing that products of different grades are 
being produced in different runs.  In this work, a stable RtR control scheme that 
eliminates the drift characteristics of the equipment using a feed-forward control is 
proposed. 
    Online batch particle size control in the production of submicron particles has been 
extensively investigated[11],[12].  Integration of within batch and batch-to-batch control 
has also been studied[13],[14].  Since a bench-scale experiment[15] is relatively easy to set 
up and empirical model for predicting the size of silica particles have been developed[16], 
it serves a good platform for testing various mixed product run run-to-run control 
strategies.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  In section 2, the basic algorithms of 
the tool-based approach, the product-based approach were introduced and our proposed 
feed-forward+feedback approach was developed.  In section 3, the process and 
disturbance models used in the controller were described.  Details of experiments and 
simulator model were given in appendices A and B.   Simulation results and 
experimental validations were presented in section 4.  Lastly, conclusions from this 
study were given in section 5.

Figure 2 describes the block diagram of a standard EWMA controller.  Since the 
controller is product specific, it is obvious that the control action will become more and 
more sluggish if interval between runs for the product becomes large.  Control 
performance will be degraded. 
Zheng et al.[5] present a general analysis of the "tool-based" approach.  It showed 
that a tool-based approach becomes unstable when (1) the disturbance is non-stationary 
and (2) model errors for different products are different.  Readers are referred to the 
paper for mathematical details.  Our main conjecture in this work is that if the pattern 
drift is eliminated by a feed-forward control, the remaining disturbance will be stationary.  
A simple integral control will be sufficient to maintain the quality of the system.  If we 
assume that there exists patterned change in tool condition, and its effects on different 
products are known in a priori, the model become:

preparation of the ammonia feed for a run (see step 3 of appendix A).  Hence the 
concentration of the ammonia stock solution decreases from run to run until the bottle is 
used up and a fresh bottle is opened.  Figure 5 shows open loop experimental results 
when the weight of ammonia solution added are maintained at 4.2 g and 3.3 g respectively.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
4.1 Single Product Control 
If only one grade of product is produced, the diameter of the particle can be 
controlled from run to run by a simple EWMA controller.  Simulation and experimental 
results of single product run-to-run control are shown in Figures 6(target=250 nm) and 
7(target=200 nm). The simulation results show that as the concentrations of aqueous 
ammonia decreases, the EWMA controller will adjust the weight of ammonia added.  In 
the experiments, we found that whenever a new bottle of stock ammonia is used, upsets 
will be introduced and the controller will automatically adjust weight of aqueous 
ammonia used until a suitable weight is found when the decay in concentration of 
aqueous ammonia become negligible. All subsequent runs will be close to the targets.

production recipe can be quickly adjusted by the information of tool change 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
 In this work, a bench scale reactor that produces silica particles with different 
diameters by a sol-gel process was used as a platform to explain and compare several RtR 
control philosophies for batch-based mixed run production.  We showed that even the 
disturbance came from changes in condition of the tool; its effects on different products 
may not be exactly the same.  Information obtained in previous runs of different 
products should only be used with careful discretion.  A tool-based EWMA approach 
without taking into account the effect of different products will not work.  A 
product-based RtR control approach utilized only information of previous run of the same 
product.  Hence the effect of a product-based controller on an infrequent product would 
be minimal.   Since the drift is the main cause of instability, it can be calibrated using an 
open experiment in which the fixed recipe inputs are executed and outcome of these runs 
are allowed to drift.  Compensations of this drift can be preprogrammed and then used as 
a feed-forward term in subsequent runs. In this way, the condition tool can be used to 
adjust the recipes of all products effectively.  The advantages of this 
feed-forward/feedback run-to-run controller are demonstrated by simulation and 
experimentally.

(EPC). It is achieved by adjusting process inputs (recipes) at the beginning of each 
run based on information obtained from previous runs. In the last decade, RtR control 
has been extensively deployed in the semi-conductor industry. Research and 
development in this area have been summarized by many authors in books and review 
articles (Castillo and Hurwitz, 1997; Moyne, et al., 2001; Edgar, et al., 2000; Castillo, 
2002, Qin, et al. 2006). 
Most of RtR control algorithms are based on the assumption that there is only a 
single product fabricated in the manufacturing line (Butler & Stefani, 1994, Sachs, et 
al. 1995, Chen and Guo 2001). This is, however, far from reality. In semi-conductor 
manufacturing industry, production resembles an automated assembly line in which 
many similar products with different specifications are manufactured step-by-step, 
with each step being a complicated physiochemical batch process carried out by a 
number of tools. A specific combination of product and tool is known as a "thread" 
(Firth et al, 2006).  Single product RtR control algorithms can be applied to a thread.  
However, the number of threads can be very large, upto thousands in a foundry fab.  
It is cumbersome to maintain so many controllers. Moreover, controller performance 
will be degraded for those infrequent threads since condition of the tool may be quite 
different from the last run of the same thread. Zheng et al. (2006) showed that even if 
the actual root cause is the change in condition of the tool, a single tool-based EWMA 
controller is unstable if the model uncertainties of different products are different.  
Pasadyn and Edgar (2005) and Firth et al. (2006) proposed to estimate contributions 
to biases states of each tool and product individually using previous runs and 
recombined them to determine recipe adjustments of future runs.  However, in each 
production run, one product is manufactured on one tool.  It can be shown that 
absolute individual states of products and tools are not observable.  Pasadyn and 
Edgar (2005) include the qualifying wafers and assumed that the performance of 
qualifying wafer is equivalent to tool performance.  However, there is always the 
dilemma of reduced throughout capacity if there are frequent runs of non-product test 
wafers and reduced sensitivity of the identification algorithm if only a few qualifying 
wafers are used. Firth et al. (2006) proposed a least square method known as 
just-in-time adaptive disturbance estimation (JADE) which includes additional 
constraints that the product and tool states remained unchanged from run-to-run and a 
proprietary weighting method. 
In statistics, the problem of identification of different bias factors has been 
described as the analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Montgomery, 1997). In this work, a 
novel state estimation method based on ANOVA is developed to estimate the relative 
states of each product and the relative states of each tool to the grand average 
performance of this station in the fab. This method is formulated in a form of 
1 when n and m are equal to the tool nk and product mk of record k. For the incidence 
matrix [ ]Z , there are N+M+1 columns, but since  
N+1 N M +1

the actual column rank is N+M-1, i.e. it is rank deficient by 2. However, given the two 
ANOVA constraints, we have

     (5) 
It should be pointed out that although the number of possible threads is NM, the 
possible number of different rows is greater than the number of independent columns. 
However, the actual number of threads is usually much less because some products 
with small lot counts may not be spread to all tools.  There should be more than 
N+M-1 threads to make [ ]Z '  full rank so that an unbiased estimate of [ ]α  can be 
obtained.  Furthermore, in some fabs, certain tools may be dedicated to produce 
certain products and vice versa.  We must ensure that such groupings are treated as a 
separate system.   
2.2 ANOVA State Space Model 
If we assumed that the ANOVA states are stationary over several periods of time, 
then ANOVA model of the multi-tool and multi-product plant can be expressed in the 
following state space form: 
[ ] [ ][ ] [ ]t+1 t tT +α α ω=             (6) 
[ ][ ] [ ]t t tYˆ ' Z ' +α υ⎡ ⎤ =⎣ ⎦             (7) 
where [ tω ] and [ tυ ] are independent, zero-mean, Gaussian noise processes of 
covariance matrices [Q] and [R], respectively. [T] is the transition matrix

           (8) 
The system is observable if observability matrix for the above ANOVA state space 
model is  
model can be updated whenever the result of a single run is reported.  However it is 
important to ensure that [ ]Z'  over an extended history is of full rank N+M+1.  This 
assumption may be invalid if some products are terminated or a certain tool is offline 
for an extended period of time. The assurance of the above full rank assumption can 
be achieved by monitoring the condition number of the matrix tP⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦ .   
2.4 Run-to-run control 
The control objective is to maintain the process output as close to target as 
possible. Given a set of predicted states t t 1α −⎡ ⎤⎣ ⎦ , the deadbeat control action in the 
period t, before new data arrive are given by:

3. Simulation study 
In this section a series of simulation tests are designed to investigate the 
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various operation scenarios.  A simple 
two-tool-three-product example is used in the following simulation studies. Note that 
it is easy to identify the changes of tools or products using the ANOVA estimator 
proposed in this paper.  If the ANOVA states of the tools or products remain stable, 
the corresponding conditions of the tools or products are confirmed to be unchanged. 
In case of a change of the ANOVA state are observed, the change of nμ τ+  or 
mpμ +   confirms the change of the tool n or the product m. Furthermore, the changes 
of nμ τ+  or mpμ +   are consistent with the actual states toolna and prodma . 
3.1 Tool-shift 
There are many events which can result in an apparent immediate shift in the 
operating conditions. For instance, such a disturbance might occur when a tool 
undergoes a maintenance event.    
The comparisons of actual and estimated ANOVA states, the actual and estimated 
states of actual biases and relative bias of the each tool and products are shown in 
Figure 1. In this case, there is an abrupt change for the bias value of tool 1 at the 200th 
run. In Figure 1a, we found that the ANOVA states μ  and 1τ  experience positive 
shifts while the ANOVA tool state 2τ  experience a shift in the other direction.  In 
Figure 1b, it is found that the average performance of all products on tool 1 1μ τ+   
In this paper a novel state estimation method based on statistics method ANOVA 
is developed to estimate the relative states of each product and the relative states of 
each tool to the grand average of this station in the fab.  The method is formulated in 
a form of recursive state estimation using Kalman filter.  Simulation results show 
that the correct ANOVA states can be estimated in production scenarios such as 
tool-shift, tool-drift, product ramp-up and offline. Furthermore, application of this 
state estimation method in a minimum variance based RtR control scheme shows that 
substantial improvement of quality of products with small run counts.  This makes 
the proposed method highly suitable for mixed product control system.
