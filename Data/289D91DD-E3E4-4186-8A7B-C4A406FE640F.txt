照變化的人臉辨識。 
2.1 以特徵為主的人臉辨識 
一般常見的人臉辨識方法大都屬此類。大多數的做法都是將圖片中的人臉找出來，
而後擷取人臉中的各個特徵(ex.眼睛、眉毛、鼻子等)再利用分類器來進行訓練與辨識。
以下將以 Lee,Hsu,etc.(2009)提出的 Facial Trait Code (簡稱 FTC)進行介紹。之所以舉此例
的原因在於其為目前較新的一個特徵辨識方法，且辨識精準度優於一些以往較為著名的
辨識方法。 
FTC 的動機主要是去發掘出存在臉部某些地方特徵─Distinctive Trait Patterns(簡稱
DTP)。其研究發現結合了 DTP 的臉部特徵能準確地捕捉到臉的外觀，可以大大提高了
最大不同臉孔之間的辨識度。DTP樣本可以被圖示符號化，並可以用來作為 n-ary臉部
特徵代碼。一個特定的臉可以編碼出一些規則的臉部特徵，使它成為一個 n-ary 臉部特
徵代碼，每個符號代碼可對應到最接近的 DTP。故 FTC 的產生可以說是用符號代碼字
描述人類的臉孔。FTC是轉換一張臉部圖片成為代碼(codeword)的過程。FTC代碼會根
據特徵的擷取集合定義成 N 個不同大小的臉部特徵。在 FTC 編碼中，一個給定的人臉
圖首先會被分解成 N 塊，而後根據事先定義好的規範給予 N 個臉部特徵。接著將每個
切好的特徵部分送入對應的特殊特徵 SVM 從而編碼。完成上述編碼後，會將其各特徵
分類製成一 FTC codebook，在辨識時即可利用此 FTC codebook來進行特徵比對。在此
研究中，其辨識方法為特徵與特徵的分別比對。也就是說一張人臉若具有 N個特徵，則
其須比對 N次。而計算兩個特徵之間的相似度時，是利用 Hamming distance來進行相似
度評估。 
 
2.2 去除光照變化方法 
研究證明光照變化和姿勢變化對圖像的影響大於物體的身分，也就是說兩個不同的
人在相同光照與相同姿勢下，其相似程度有很大的機率會比同一個人但姿勢和光照有劇
烈變化的影像來的相似。而在人臉辨識的領域裡，光照變化影響(不同角度有不同的影
響，ex. 陰影)也一直都是人臉辨識的難題，故大多數的研究僅偏向於人臉表情變化來做
人臉辨識。然而，以人臉辨識而言，這是不夠精確的。因此，本小節主要探討光照變化
的處理方法。希望透過這些方法延伸出新的思維。在以往的研究中用來處理光照變化的
方法主要有光照錐體(Illumination Cone)[2]、商值影像(Quotient Image)[3]及內部光照空間
(Intrinsic Illumination Subspace)[4]等等。 
商值圖像由 Riklin-Raviv & Shashua(2001)提出，主要是用於解決圖像辨識與不
同光照的渲染(rendering)問題[3]。商值圖像可透過圖像比來取得一種不會隨光
照變化而變化的人臉圖像表示方法。其利用最小能量方程式將求光照方向的問
題轉換成為求線性方程式的的近似解。且其避免了精確的對人臉進行三維建模，
故執行效率較高。其理論必須滿足下述幾個條件：  
（1）欲處理的圖像須滿足 Lambertian模型，物體的成像是在點光源下完成。如此一來
物體圖像即可藉由物體表面的反射率、物體表面的法向量以及點光源之間餘弦夾角的乘
積表示，公式如 2.3： 
式中Ri為物體 i的反照率，n(x, y)是物體的表面。 
在理想類別中的物體擁有不同的反照率函數，所以他們能在圖片空間中橫跨不同的
線性子空間。然而，透過(13)移除反照率因子，其導致光照圖片只有依賴於一般表面和
光照條件。這意味著由於理想類別的假設，所有在相同理想類別中的物體分享了相同的
通用內部照明子空間。根據上述的內部光照子空間，Chen& Chen又提出了光照一般化
(lighting normalization)的方法。其基本理念是要將一張輸入的人臉圖(I)的光照圖(L)透過
內部光照子空間的方式給取出來。我們可得知 I = R ∗ L                                    (2.8) 
然而一般而言，影像的組成可分為低頻部分與高頻部分。高頻影響表情，而低頻影響了
光照變化。因此，在評估光照變化時，往往採用低頻元件來幫助我們達成目標。在此研
究中，其採用了輸入影像的低頻部分來作為初始化公式，如 2.9 L∗ = F ⋆ I                                    (2.9) 
式中，I為輸入圖像，F為平滑函數(此研究採用高斯平滑函數)，L∗ 為圖片經高斯平滑函
數處理後的圖片。 
最近似光照變化圖 L的是根據歐式距離由內部光照子空間重建而成，如公式 2.10和 2.11 l = arg minl ||Bl −  L∗ ||                        (2.10) L = Bl                                 (2.11) 
其中 B是內部光照子空間的基礎矩陣。將公式 2.10與 2.10代回公式 2.8則可求得圖片
的反照率。 
根據上述，商值影像及內部光照空間等方法，可將其視為影像的前處理動作。其皆
先將欲辨識的人臉透過影像處理的方法將圖片中的光照變化過濾掉後，再進一步的用過
濾掉光照變化影響的圖片來進行辨識。而本系統是採用自商影像的方法來過濾人臉圖像
中的光照變化。之所以採用自商影像的原因有下述兩點 
1. 商值圖象僅利用三種不同光照條件合成人臉樣本，藉此樣本來估計所有光照
情況。然而這並不能很好的對極端光照條件進行處理。此外它忽略了人臉自
身陰影的存在，故合成樣本受陰影之影響會較為明顯。 
2. 光照錐體方法至少需要每個目標在不同光照條件下的 7 幅圖像，並且計算
量非常龐大，這對於大多數的應用來說並無法符合實際需求，因此難以實用 
2.3 雙最佳多波段分析 
 因本研究之架構主要參考雙最佳多波段分析之架構並加以改良，故本節主要介紹雙
最佳波段特徵的臉部辨識方法。其主要利用小波轉換來達到區分圖片波段的效果。小波
轉換分為高頻與低頻。在人臉辨識中，主要的辨識方向從兩方面著手。一為表情；二為
光照變化的影響。人臉圖像在小波轉換中的高頻與低頻的圖片，可將其視為光照變化影
響與表情影響兩種。 
  
 假設目前欲辨識的人臉圖有 N張，利用一相似矩陣ρ(𝑖, 𝑗)針對圖 i與圖 j做其不相似
度之計算，若圖 i與圖 j為同一張圖，則ρ(𝑖, 𝑗) ≈ 1，反之，ρ(𝑖, 𝑗) ≈ 0，此方法稱為 Average 
Unmatched Similarity Value( AUMSV)，公式如 2.12： 
用這些預設參數就可以解決很多問題；並且提供了交互檢驗(Cross Validation)的功能。 
3.1 自商圖像 
 自商影像的理念是由 Retinex 模型[23]而延伸。故本研究以 Retinex 模型來簡單的
說明。Retinex 模型對影像的描述為「影像是透過物體表面對入射光的反射及四周的光
照所混合而成」。Retinex 模型的公式為：  
I = RL                     (3.2) 
其中 I 代表靜態影像；R 代表物體的表面反射光；L 代表物體四周的光照。其中 L亦
可被視為低頻的分量，其可以透過使用一個低通濾波器進行模擬。故 L可以用下式表
示：  
L ≈ F * I                 (3.3) 
公式 3.3中 F 代表的是低通濾波器。根據公式 3.3的結果，R可以被表示成：  R = I
L
= I
F∗I
                (3.4) 
自商影像的原理主要是透過上述 3.4的公式來設計一個權重式的高斯低通濾波器，
然後用此濾波器過濾掉影像中的光照變化，進而將其去除。如此一來可使影像受光照變
化影響的部分大幅減少，以便用來做辨識。其影像的性質主要取決於平滑因子 F(本研究
中的平滑因子為高斯濾波器)的大小，如果 F太小，Q 接近於 1，將會使影像損失許多
反射信息；如果 F 太大，則會導致階梯形的邊緣會有暈輪效應。 
 要得到自商影像首先要有數種不同設計的權重式高斯濾波器來將影像過濾，而後將
其各個過濾結果合併。因此在處理自商影像時需要準備多個高斯濾波器。利用不同的權
重式高斯濾波器來過濾影像，如下式所示 Îk = I ⊕ 1N WGk，k = 1, 2 ,3 … … . . , n           (3.5) 
公式 3.5中的 I表示原始影像；Îk表示濾波後的結果；而1N WGk指的就是圖 2-14中的 F；
N表示圖 2-14中 F’的數值總和；而 k表示第 k個權重式高斯濾波器。 
  而過濾後的 Îk主要為代表影像中光照變化之部分。根據 Retinex 模型所示，我們
可以利用原始影像除去光照變化。如公式 3.6：  Qk = IÎk, k=1,2,…,n             (3.6) 
公式 3.6中Qk表示除去光照變化部分後的影像；但是在經過上述步驟後，除了光照變化
被過濾掉外，影像中高頻部分的雜訊也被放大了。因此我們需要透過一個非線性轉換來
將Qk轉換到Dk藉此降低雜訊，如公式 3.7所示： Dk = T(Qk), k = 1,2, … , n         (3.7) 
公式 3.7中的 T為 Log轉換。 
之後我們將不同設計的權重式高斯濾波器處理後的結果，根據其權重加總起來。在 
本研究中，我們將權重值皆定為 1，如公式 3.8所示： Q =  ∑ mkDknk=1        (3.8)

第4章、 實驗結果與結論 
本研究所採用的辨識圖片是Yale B[11]的人臉資料庫。其資料庫中圖片人數共10人，
每人 585張或 520張圖片。而本研究在訓練時的圖片為每人 9張，測試時為每人 2張。
並依人數由少到多分別進行了 5次測試。 
 下面表 4-1與 4-2分別為本研究的環境設置：

表 4- 2：軟體環境設置 
軟體環境 
作業系統 Windows 7 家用進階版

本研究的辨識率如下，圖 4-1與 4-2分別依人數來區分，每個辨識率都為平均後的
結果。而圖 4-3則為本研究將光照變化與不含光照變化的辨識結合後的辨識率，這也是
結論 
在人臉辨識的過程中，光照變化一直都是辨識的瓶頸。而本研究根據現有光照處理
方法提供一個不同以往的思考，不僅將光照過濾且利用光照變化來做辨識。雖然就目前
的辨識率而言，還可以有很多的改善空間。然而找出光照部分辨識不良的主因，而後加
以改善，這將會是一個簡單易用的辨識方法。而且將會較貼近於現實生活的實際情況。

ABSTRACT  
This paper proposed a new methodology for auto document classification. 
Document classification means to classify a document into a specific category, such 
as sports or entertainment, etc. Our methodology simplifies the traditional method for 
building an auto document classification system. We use sentence structure analysis 
model (SSAM) to segment terms and obtain the part-of-speech as the feature terms. 
The feature terms are trained by support vector machine (SVM) to build a prediction 
model. So the unclassified documents can be imported to compare with the prediction 
model, and then the category of target document can be obtained. Auto document 
classification system can integrate with web services architecture as a cloud 
computing service. For examples, users do not need to manually choose a category or 
fill in tags for adding an article on blogs or forums. 
However, most of document datasets are imbalance. Traditional feature value of 
term (TF or TF-IDF) only performs well in text classification for the balanced dataset. 
We proposed by using term weighting scheme to improves the performance for text 
classification for imbalance dataset. Classic4 dataset is used to verify that our 
methodology is effective, and the 
1F Value for auto categorizing is 92.6%. We also 
use Reuter-21578 to test the performance of term weighting scheme for imbalanced 
dataset. The 
1F Value of our proposed scheme is 77.2% which is higher than other 
researches.
