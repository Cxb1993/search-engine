downstream of each rib and elevate the local heat transfer 
coefficients in the vicinity of bleed holes that increase the 
spatially averaged heat transfer by about 25% [2]. With 
20-25% of the drawing coolant flow from the bleed holes 
in a two-pass square channel roughened by a variety of 
surface ribs, Ekkad et al. demonstrated that the regionally 
averaged heat transfer levels with bleeds were similar as 
that for a rib roughened surface without bleeds [3]. 
Thurman and Poinsatte [4] examined the detailed heat 
transfer distributions for a triple-pass channel roughened 
by transverse ribs at the different bleed conditions of 
uniform bleed, increasing and decreasing bleed flow rates 
per hole and no-bleed. The uniform bleed condition 
generally provided the better heat transfer enhancement 
among the various bleed conditions compared in [4]. 
Chanteloup and Bölics [5] performed the detailed PIV flow 
measurements in a two-pass channel roughened by 
staggered 450 ribs with bleeds from one ribbed wall of the 
second passage. As the coolant flow is ejected from one 
ribbed wall, the streamwise velocity profile is driven 
toward the bleed wall that generates the strongly 
asymmetrical secondary flow pattern. The secondary flow 
cells adjacent to the bleed wall have almost diminished 
with its counter-rotating secondary flow cells to be 
enlarged in the entire test channel. As the airflow in a gas 
turbine rotor blade rotates about an axis orthogonal to the 
main flow direction, the rotation manifesting effects along 
with the flow phenomena in association with the bleeds 
provide synergistic influences on the flow pattern as well 
as the turbulence structure and the cooling performance for 
a rotating channel with bleeds.  
 
The so-called orthogonal mode rotation induces Coriolis 
forces to generate the secondary flows in perpendicular to 
the main flow direction that interact with the rib triggered 
flows to produce a rich mode of secondary flow patterns in 
a rotating ribbed channel. The turbulence intensity is 
promoted on the unstable side but suppressed on the stable 
side of an orthogonally rotating channel with the spanwise 
roll-cells generated as the relative strengths of Coriolis 
forces reach beyond the critical ratios [6]. Variations of the 
volumetric centrifugal force acting on the coolant are 
functionally related with the local distributions of fluid 
density, which is a spatial function in the rotating channel 
when the process of heat convection proceeds. A 
buoyancy-type alteration to the flow field driven by the 
centrifugal acceleration in the order up to 50000g forms the 
considerable impact on the cooling performance of the 
internal coolant channel in a gas turbine rotor blade [7]. 
The operating temperatures of a gas turbine rotor blade, the 
complex internal cooling configurations as well as the 
extremely high rotational speed have combined to oppose 
the progress in acquiring the laboratory scale heat transfer 
data with a realistic simulation of engine conditions. Many 
previous studies for the turbine rotor blade cooling were 
confined to low Ro with simplified channel geometries that 
examined the flow and heat transfer characteristics in 
rotating channels at the conditions away from the realistic 
engine situations [8-18]. This sector of researches [8-18] 
focuses on the geometrical parameters relevant to the 
cooling performance of a rotating channel that include the 
configuration of rib floor, the channel orientation and cross 
sectional shape, the type of surface roughness such as 
pin-fin or dimple and the multi-pass channels connected by 
180 deg turns. Reductions of Reynolds number to elevate 
the rotational number also became a long term, but 
inadequate, approach for such laboratory scale experiments. 
This approach comprises the opportunity to stimulate the 
turbulence structures at the conditions of high Re which 
undermines the reflection of realistic rotational effects on 
turbulence structures for laboratory scale experiments. In 
general, the typical gas turbine engine speed falls in the 
range of 3000-20000 rev/min with the maximum Re of 
100000 for the internal coolant flow that gives the Ro 
range of 0-2 [19]. There is a strategic need to extend the 
experimental data in order to emulate more closely the 
realistic engine conditions by extending the ranges of Re 
and Ro simultaneously. A touch of the realistic engine 
conditions that simultaneously satisfy the conditions of 
Re>10000 and Ro>0.45 are those studies preformed with 
high pressures [20-26]. To acquire such laboratory scale 
heat transfer data with Re, Ro and Δρ/ρ simultaneously 
reaching the engine conditions, the rotating tests are 
performed with high pressures and large hydraulic 
diameters of test channels. Our preliminarily studies using 
this approach have acquired two sets of heat transfer data 
in the range of Re×Ro < 13500 and Ro < 1.8 [25-26]. The 
present study adopts the similar experimental approach but 
elevates the Reynolds number to the range of 15000-30000 
that gives the rotation number up to 0.8 which closely 
approaches the engine conditions.  
 
It is now a common practice to bleed coolant streams from 
the apical sidewall of the trapezoidal sectioned coolant 
channel at the tail end of a gas turbine rotor blade. The 
modifications of the entire flow structures due to the side 
bleeds together with the complexities introduced by the 
Coriolis and centrifugal buoyancy effects in a ribbed 
channel provide considerable heat transfer impacts that 
prohibit the adequate use of the previous experimental data 
for such design applications. There have been no previous 
attempts reported in the open literature that examined the 
heat transfer in a rotating ribbed channel with bleeds which 
operates at the conditions reaching the lower end of engine 
conditions. The lack of knowledge despite of its wide 
industrial applications for rotor blade cooling motivates the 
present study to investigate the heat transfer phenomena in 
a rotating trapezoidal duct with 45-deg staggered ribs and 
bleeds from the apical sidewall at high Reynolds and high 
rotation numbers. The method of generating heat transfer 
correlation [25, 26] is repeated to device a set of Nusselt 
number correlations over the bleed region of the rotating 
channel. Influences of sidewall bleeds on the rotational 
effects are examined by comparing two sets of rotational 
heat transfer data generated with and without bleeds from 
the trapezoidal duct. The empirical heat transfer correlation 
that demonstrates the numerical consistencies with the 
actual measurements is applicable to the design of the 
coolant channel in the tail end of a gas turbine rotor blade.

wall temperatures. The coordinate system and the locations 
of these thermocouples with respect to the rib and mid-rib 
locations along the centerline of rib floor are indicated in 
Fig. 2. Ceramic cements are applied at the thermocouple 
junctions to secure their positions on each heating foil. 
Thermocouple wires are taken out of the test section 
through the grooves machined on the tufnol leading and 
trailing walls (1)(2). The high temperature sealant is filled 
in these grooves to inhibit the air leakage. The 
thermocouple and heater wire harness is taken from the test 
section and then connected to the instrumentation and 
power slip rings via the grooves machined on the keyways 
of rotating shaft. Although the peripheral temperature 
variations that reflect the impacts of sidewall bleeds and 
the rotation and rib induced secondary flows on heat 
transfer are expected, this study is limited by the available 
channels of instrumentation slip-ring unit. As a result, the 
peripheral heat transfer variations over the rib floors are 
not investigated by the present study. 
 
A cylindrical plenum chamber (16) consolidates with the 
bottom end flange (9) within which several layers of fine 
meshes (11) is installed. The complete set of the test 
section is tightened between the top and bottom flanges 
(8)(9) by four draw-bolts (12). A convergent channel of 
150 mm long is fitted on the top end flange (8) where an 
exhaust valve (13) is attached at the exit end to adjust the 
pressure level inside the test section. Air leakage from each 
jointed surface is prevented by means of a series of internal 
'O' ring seals.  
 
The fluid temperature at flow entrance is measured by a 
type K thermocouple (14) penetrating into the entry 
plenum chamber. The fluid properties required to evaluate 
Re and Ro when the heat transfer test is performing are 
calculated based on this measured air inlet temperature. 
The enthalpy balance method is employed to evaluate the 
streamwise fluid bulk temperatures in the section without 
bleed. As previously described, the fluid temperature from 
each bleed hole (Tf) in equation (3) is detected by the 
thermocouple (5) penetrating into the core of each bleed 
passage. The local fluid bulk temperature (Tb) at each 
measurement station is accordingly defined using equation 
(3). At the exit plane of the test channel, three type K 
thermocouples (15) penetrate into the test channel at three 
different spanwise locations as indicated in Fig. 2. The 
measured fluid bulk temperature at the exit plane of the test 
channel is obtained by averaging these three temperature 
measurements which is treated as the reference to checked 
with the evaluated Tb value at the flow exit. Agreements 
between the evaluated and measured fluid bulk 
temperatures at the exit plane confirm the accuracy of 
equation (3) and the adequacy of the present data 
acquisition system. The experimental raw data is 
acceptable when the difference between the evaluated and 
measured Tb values at the exit plane is less than +10%. 
This procedure for acquiring Tb data with no thermocouple 
penetrating into the flow passage is attempted to avoid the 
disturbance of flow field in the test channel.

2.3 Program 
Initially the static and rotating heat transfer tests for the 
channel without bleed are performed to generate the 
database against which the heat transfer results for the 
channel with bleeds are compared. For each set of test 
channel with or without bleed, the static tests are followed 
by a series of rotating experiments with the influences of 
rotation on heat transfer examined. Each set of rotating 
data for the test channel with or without bleed is produced 
at fixed Re and Ro by adjusting the rotational speed at a 
constant entry pressure level. To investigate the rotating 
buoyancy effect, four ascending heater powers to raise the 
highest Tw levels to 348, 373, 403 and 433 K are used for 
each selected Re-Ro combination. The flow and heater 
power are generally kept for about 30 min in order to reach 
the steady state after the airflow rate or the heating power 
is adjusted. The present steady state condition is assumed 
when the timewise wall temperature variations for several 
successive Tw scans are less than +0.30C. The time interval 
between such successive scans is about 60 seconds. All the 
relevant steady state measurements are stored for the post 
data processing that converts the raw measurements into 
the dimensionless groups defined in equation (1) with the 
fluid properties calculated from the local fluid bulk 
temperature. 
 
The dimensionless data generated in the phase of rotating 
experiments is analyzed to examine the influences of 
rotation on heat transfer for the channel with sidewall 
bleeds. A set of empirical heat transfer correlations is 
derived that permits the evaluation of the individual and 
interactive effects of Re, Ro and Bu on heat transfer in the 
bleed section of the test channel. The Nu variations 
triggered by a systematic variation of a targeting variable 
in equation (1) with the remaining dimensionless groups 
unchanged unravel the individual heat transfer impact in 
association with the targeting variable. However, it is 
impractical to eliminate the influences of rotating 
buoyancy heat transfer as the finite wall-to-fluid 
temperature difference is essential to experimentally define 
the Nusselt number. As a result, the experimental heat 
transfer results generated in the series of rotational tests 
involve certain degrees of buoyancy impacts. The so called 
zero-buoyancy heat transfer data is therefore acquired by 
extrapolating the rotational heat transfer data into the 
limiting condition of Bu=0. This regression procedure is 
attempted to define the heat transfer level without the

Fig. 4 Axial distributions of Nu/Nu∞ ratios along 
leading and trailing centerline with Re = 15000, 20000, 
25000 and 30000 at rotation number of 0.3 for the 
rotating channels with and without bleed. 
 
3.3 Parametric analysis and heat transfer correlation 
The heat transfer data collected from the rotating channels 
with and without bleed as shown in Figs. 4 and 5 is 
affected by the combined Re, Ro and Bu impacts. The 
comparison of heat transfer results depicted in Figs. 4 and 
5 highlights the influences of sidewall bleed on heat 
transfer due to the synergistic bleed and Re-Ro-Bu impacts. 
Disengagements of the interactive Re-Ro-Bu impacts that 
unravel the individual influences of Re, Ro and Bu on 
rotational heat transfer are performed for the rotating 
channel with sidewall bleeds through the parametric 
analysis which leads to the generation of heat transfer 
correlation for design applications. 
 
By way of comparison with the static Nusselt number 
(Nu0), the rotational heat transfer data is expressed as the 
Nusselt number ratio (Nu/Nu0) which indices the rotation 
induced heat transfer variation from the static reference. As 
Nu0 is defined by equation (4) that involves the functional 
component of Ren, the expression of Nu/Nu0 ratio is 
attempted to isolate the Re effect from the Ro-Bu impacts 
via the Ren relationship. This is testified by comparing the 
axial distributions of Nu/Nu0 ratio obtained at a fixed 
rotation number but with different Reynolds numbers of 
15000, 20000, 25000 and 30000. The convergence of 
different Nu/Nu0 ratios obtained from different Reynolds 
numbers at each measurement station with a fixed rotation 
number verifies the applicability of isolating Re impacts 
from the rotational influences via the Ren relationship. This 
is demonstrated by Fig. 5 in which the axial distributions of 
Nu/Nu0 ratio along the leading and trailing edges of the 
bleed channel with Re = 15000, 20000, 25000 and 30000 at 
the fixed rotation number of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 are 
compared. The averaged buoyancy numbers along the 
leading or trailing centerline is selected at a nominal value 
for each four sets of data trend obtained with different 
Reynolds numbers but at a fixed rotation number. Heat 
transfer results revealed in each plot of Fig. 5 demonstrate 
the satisfactory data convergence for each selected rotation 
number at each axial station. Isolations of Re impacts from 
the rotation manifesting mechanisms via the Ren 
relationship deem to be acceptable. Cross examinations of 
Nu/Nu0 data shown in each plot of Fig. 5 reveal the 
systematic tendency for the trailing-edge heat transfer to 
increase as Ro increases. Ratios of Nu/Nu0 are constantly 
above than unity along the trailing centerline. But the 
leading edge heat transfer is initially reduced from the 
static reference as Ro increases but recovers by way of the 
further increase of Ro. The Nu/Nu0 ratio can fall to 0.4 at 
the rotation number of 0.2 that features the worst heat 
transfer scenario even if the rotating buoyancy effect 
appears to enhance local heat transfer. The detailed 
description for the varying manner of Nu/Nu0 ratio against 
Ro along the leading and trailing edges will be addressed in 
the section dealing with the isolated Ro impacts at the 
simulated zero-buoyancy condition. The general data 
trends depicted in Fig. 5 are consistent with the heat 
transfer results reported for the rotating channels that 
operate at high rotation numbers [20-26]. Nevertheless, 
although the heat transfer data acquired from the locations 
of the seventh rib and onwards shows the repeated-rib 
fashion in the channel without bleed, heat transfer results 
collected from the channel with bleeds are subject to the 
modified flow structures triggered by the coolant 
extractions. The subsequent parametric analysis is 
individually performed for each measurement location in 
the bleed section.

the worst heat transfer scenarios develop at the rotation 
number of 0.2 for all the axial locations along the leading 
centerline over the bleed section. With such worst heat 
transfer scenarios, the leading-edge Nu/Nu0 ratios fall in 
the range of 0.4-0.45 over the bleed section of the present 
rotating channel. 
 
Fig. 7 Variations of zero buoyancy heat transfer data 
against Ro at axial locations in bleed section. 
 
 
Fig. 8 Variations of φ2 value against Ro for rotating 
channels with and without bleed. 
 
Figure 9 examines the degrees of rotating buoyancy effects 
on heat transfer by plotting φ2 values against Ro where the 
results acquired from the rotating channels with and 
without bleed are compared. Within the parametric range 
of 0.1<Ro<0.8, the general data trend that shows φ2 values 
decrease as Ro increases is followed by all the data series 
at each axial station along the leading and trailing 
centerlines for both rotating channels with and without 
bleeds. The φ2 values in the rotating channel with sidewall 
bleeds are considerably less than the no-bleed references as 
compared in each plot of Fig. 8. The physical implication 
of this result is the weakened rotating buoyancy effects on 
heat transfer due to the sidewall bleeds. Although the φ2 
values always remain positive in the range of 0.1<Ro<0.8 
for both rotating channels, which reconfirms the improved 
local heat transfer by enhancing the relative strength of 
rotating buoyancy in isolation, the reduction of φ2 value as 
Ro increases signifies the weakened heat transfer 
enhancement attributed from the buoyancy interaction. It is 
evident that φ2 values are functions of Ro. The existence of 
coupling effects between Coriolis force and rotational 
buoyancy is assured. 
 
In the Ro range from 0.1 to 0.8, the zero-buoyancy heat 
transfer levels in terms of Nu/Nu0 ratios along both leading 
and trailing centerlines can be well correlated by linear 
functions as shown in Fig. 7. Evidences of this correlation 
process are typified in Fig. 7 that the lines shown are the 
linear regressions of the evaluated zero buoyancy heat 
transfer data. Varying manners of φ2 values against Ro are 
shown in Fig. 8 that follow the general trend of 
exponentially decay for both leading and trailing wall. In 
combination with the regression results depicted in Figs. 8 
and 9, the heat transfer correlations at the measurement 
stations in the bleed section of the present rotating channel 
along the leading and trailing centerlines are derived with

This set of empirical heat transfer correlations has been 
derived following an experimental approach to resolve the 
influences of Re, Ro and Bu on rotational Nusselt number 
along two opposite leading and trailing rib floors for the 
trapezoidal sectioned channel with bleeds from its apical 
sidewall. Heat transfer correlations specified by equations 
(4) and (6) enable the evaluation of local heat transfer 
coefficients along the bleed section of leading and trailing 
rib floors with each controlling parameter such as Re, Ro or 
Bu varied individually or simultaneously. The comparison 
of all the experimental measurements with the correlative 
predictions is performed to examine the overall success of 
the present experimental proposal. Over the entire range of 
parametric conditions examined, 95% of the present 
experimental data is found to agree within + 30% of the 
correlation proposed. This is demonstrated by Fig. 9 where 
the experimental measurements and the correlative 
evaluations are compared. Consider the complexities
