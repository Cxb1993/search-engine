Abstract 
This work describes a robust injection molding parameter design method that uses linear 
regression model and desirability function to reduce the effect of environmental noise on injection 
molded parts quality. The design objective was to achieve a uniform geometry and dimensions of 
light-guided plate (LGP) after injection molding. Firstly, a computer simulation was performed to 
test the feasibility of the desirability function, compared with the weighted principal component 
analysis, regarding their construction of a composite quality indicator that represents the 
quality-loss function of multiple qualities. The experimental design and ANOVA methods were 
then employed to select parameters that affect part qualities and adjustment factors. Secondly, a 
two-level, statistically-designed experiment using least squared error method was performed to 
generate a regression model between part quality and adjustment factors. The mathematical model 
was then used to optimize process parameters. An experimental 2.5-inch LGP injection 
compression molding was also used for performance testing. The experimental findings show that 
the robust process parameters generated by the proposed method yield a better uniform production 
quality than the initial and thus improved and uniform production quality, which validates its 
feasibility.

1. Introduction 
Injection molding is an important industrial manufacturing technique due to its cost 
advantages and ease of use in mass production. Designing robust process parameters is crucial for 
quality control of injection molding processes. Traditionally, parameter setting for injection 
molding relied on statistical analyses and experimentation, computer-aided simulations, or operator 
experience (Nirkhe & Barry, 2003; Bozzelli, 2003). However, if the setting for producing molded 
parts approaches the specification limits, the process is easily affected by environmental variation,

requirements differ, the corresponding normalization may differ as well: (1) larger-the-better - the 
target value of quality objectives is uncertain but was expected to be large, (2) smaller-the-better - 
the target value of quality objectives was uncertain and was expected to eventually be small, and (3) 
target-the-best – the target values of quality objectives were certain and were expected to be 
achieved. 
Second, the DF and WPC were individually used in this phase to convert observed data into a 
composite quality indicator, which represents a mathematical model of multi-quality characteristics. 
The desirability function method proposed by Derringer and Suich11 suggests that the composite 
quality indicator can be defined as

             (1) 
where, ‘n’ denotes the number of quality characteristics; the DF value becomes zero if one of the di 
is zero. It becomes one only if all instances of di are one. The di represents the desirability value of 
the ith quality characteristic defined by Derringer and Suich11 as follows:

where ix  represents the mean value of the ith quality characteristics; USLix ,  and LSLix ,  are the 
upper specification limit and lower specification limit of the ith quality characteristics, respectively. 
The value t is the relaxation factor, and its value is set between 0 and 10.  
In the WPC method, the normalized data are used to construct a variance-covariance matrix 
‘A’, which is illustrated below:

where *ijY  represents the normalized value for the i
th
 experimental run and jth quality 
characteristics. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of matrix A, which are represented by Vj and λj, 
respectively, are then computed. For collecting experimental data to test the validity of the 
calculated ensemble covariance matrix, Taguchi orthogonal array is recommended. 
In principal component analysis, the eigenvector Vj represents the weighting vector of j 
 6 
identified. The experimental runs were designed to combine the extreme points of a 
three-dimension process window. If a defect occurs at extreme points in the process window, a 
better region can be found by using the steepest decent method to relocate the parameter settings. 
The steps of phase 2 are: (1) design the 2K full factorial experiments - the experiments were 
designed according to the number and the possible ranges of adjustment factors. The initial central 
point for 2K full factorial experiment was obtained by referring to the optimal parameter setting of 
DOE suggested in phase 1. (2) Obtain the new φnew by using PCA for observation after 
normalization - the new quality indicators φnew are obtained. (3) Check robustness - if all the φnew 
for running 2K full factorial experiments meet the quality specification levels, this means that the 
set-points of the process parameters of this experimental group could be robust for the φnew. 
However, if the robustness confirmation fails at this point, the next step is to repeat phase 3 and 
search for another set of process parameters by employing the regression model-based robust 
parameter search method. 
2.3 Phase 3: Searching for robust process parameters 
After establishing a regression model based on the relationship between the process 
parameters and quality observations, the steepest decent method was used to determine the distance 
and direction to the target (Huang & Lin, 2008b). For any given quality observation, y and k 
number of process parameters were assumed to significantly affect quality, such as k21 ,x,,xx L . The 
sample data of full factorial experiment in the previous phase could be used to fit the regression 
model. Therefore, the following matrix can be used to obtain the data sample that fits the model:

where Y represents the vector of observation, which may be DFnew
 
or φwnew here; X represents the 
matrix of experimental runs; xnk represents the kth process parameter in the experimental run ‘n’. β 
represents the vector of estimated coefficients of the regression model, and ε represents the random 
error vector.  
The β vector can be estimated by the least squared error method as follows: 
( ) YX'XX'β 1

The composite equation of the relationship between the process parameters and the product 
quality can then be determined. Additionally, Y and matrix X in Eq. (8) must be converted into Eq. 
(9) to get coefficient β in the regression model. 
The steps of phase 3 are as follows: Step 1: establish the regression model – Eq. (7) represents 
the relationship between process parameters and parts quality. The X matrix contains the values 1 
and -1, which represent the upper and lower levels of each control factor, respectively. The second, 
 8 
selected for computer simulation was a Fanuc α-30i (Japan). 
This study designs the L18 experiment for 2-inch LGP injection molding simulated by 
Moldex3D software. The control factors were cooling time, melt temperature, mold temperature, 
filling speed, holding pressure, holding time, filling pressure, and screw stroke. The quality 
objectives of this experiment were minimal shear stress, maximal warpage, and maximal 
volumetric shrinkage rate distributed over the single cavity. Also, two similar values of material 
viscosity were used as a noise factor in the L18 outer orthogonal array. The experimental factor 
levels were selected according to the material features provided by the material supplier. The 
simulation results includes shear stress, warpage, and shrinkage, and they were further normalized 
as average normalized shear stress, average normalized warpage, and average normalized shrinkage, 
respectively. The factor levels were used to construct the variance-covariance matrix and then to 
calculate eigenvalues through PCA. The maximal shear stress, maximal warpage, and maximal 
volumetric shrinkage rate with the corresponding weighting of the first, second and third principal 
component, were eigenvectors [-0.061, 0.706, 0.706]T, [0.998, 0.047, 0.040] T, and [0.005, -0.707, 
0.707] T, respectively. This vector was substituted into Eq. (5) to calculate the first principal 
component φ1, and so was as well as the second and third principal components φ2 and φ3. 
Accountability proportions corresponding to the first, second and third weighting factors of the 
WPC were 0.625, 0.334, and 0.041, respectively. 
The quality observation obtained from L18 experiment was then converted into φ1, φ2 and φ3 
using PCA. The values of φw and DF converted from observations are then calculated, respectively. 
The composite quality indicators generated by WPC and DF both obtained the same optimal 
combination. 
The ANOVA analysis is used to examine the DF and φw values from the L18 experiment. The 
ANOVA results show that melt temperature, mold temperature, and holding time significantly 
affected the value of the composite quality indicators, so these three factors were selected as 
adjustment factors. Using these three adjustment factors in the full factorial test of multi-quality 
characteristics, the central point of the process window was the set-point of the current process 
parameters. The optimal combinations of process parameters, according to the Taguchi method, are 
260oC melt temperature, 60oC mold temperature, and 5 s holding time. In the robustness testing 
experiment, the ranges for the process window for mold temperature and melt temperature were set 
at ±5oC, and the holding time was set at ±0.5 s, which was ten times that of the resolution of the 
injection molding machine. The preferred quality characteristics were smaller-the-better, and the 
quality specifications were defined as follows: shear stress less than 1.25 MPa, warpage less than 
1.5µm, and volumetric shrinkage rate less than 1%. 
The DF and φw represent the averaged normalized composite quality indicators generated by 
DF and WPC, respectively. The values of DF at Exp. No. 3 and 4 and φw at Exp. No. 3 were 
unqualified. Since not all process parameters reached the desired level of robustness, the procedure 
continued to phase 3 to find the set-point of robust process parameters. The set-point was found in 
the combination of melt temperature of 263oC, mold temperature of 57oC, and holding time of 5.3 s. 
 10
mm and 3.9 mm, compression speeds of 550 mm and 539 mm, and cooling times of 45 s and 44.5 s. 
The DF values in the tables did not meet all robustness criteria in this phase. Thus, the search was 
repeated until a set-point that met the robustness criteria was found. 
The additional verification was performed to test the robustness of the optimal process 
parameters found by the DF method. The two set points, the initial central point and the robust 
central point, were used to inject fifty molds as measurement samples, i.e., the initial setting of 
robust process parameters were compression distance of 5 mm, compression speed of 550 mm/s, 
and cooling time of 45 s. The robust process parameters were compression distance of 4.8 mm, 
compression speed of 548 mm/s, and cooling time of 45.4 s. results of robustness testing. In this 
case study, the initial setting of process parameters obtained almost unqualified LGP for the 
average 9-point micro-structure height, and eighteen of fifty parts were unqualified within the range. 
In contrast, the performance of the proposed method for optimizing process parameters generated 
100% qualified products. Thus, the average value and standard deviation of part qualities were 
substantially improved by the proposed method. 
4. Conclusions 
This work proposed a robust parameter searching method that not only identifies the set-point 
of robust parameters of an injection molding process for multi-quality characteristics, but also 
meets the requirements of multi-quality characteristics of molded parts. Computer simulations and 
light-guided plate experiments were performed to examine this method, and its performance was 
also compared with the WPC-assisted Taguchi method. The proposed search method was based on 
a DF method that can successfully construct a composite quality indicator, which represents the 
mathematical model of multi-quality characteristics and a regression model-based search method 
that can reflect variables to adjust search distance and direction. The proposed method has five 
major advantages. (1) The operator is not required to use complex experimental designs. (2) The 
regression model for describing the mathematical relationship between part quality and process 
parameters is simple, and the inference of robust process parameters is efficient. (3) The ratio of 
products disqualified due to unstable machines and non-uniform materials is decreased, and the 
effectiveness of the molding process is improved. (4) The treatment applied in the full-factorial 
experiments can be confirmed to ensure that the molding process is robust. (5) The search for 
robust parameters is not restricted to the designed levels of controlled factors. In summary, the 
experimental results indicate that the proposed method effectively solves the problem of 
multi-quality characteristics, significantly improves the stability of the molding process, and 
increases yield.
