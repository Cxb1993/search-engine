Abstract 
Silane is a highly hazardous pyrophoric gas. It 
is also the most commonly used specialty gas 
used in the semiconductor, optoelectronic, 
solar cell industries. Although silane is 
pyrophoric, silane release from high pressure 
source under certain conditions will not 
autoignite. The unignited silane will mixed 
with air forming an explosive gas mixture. 
Upon reducing source pressure, silane 
re-ignited and ignited the explosive mixture 
which creates significant overpressure in a 
confined space. This is the most dangerous 
situation a silane release could cause. Current 
literature can not explain properly why high 
pressure silane release cannot ignite. All 
possible explanations are also different. As the 
no ignition mechanism remains unclear, it is 
impossible to define an effective procedure to 
handle such a release. 
 This study aims to resolve the mechanism 
through a systematic and thorough studies of 
the release conditions (temperature, pressure, 
velocity etc.) and the dispersion cloud. A 
condition for ignition/no-ignition will be 
proposed. Tests were performed for releases at 
controlled and steady velocities. With careful 
control of vent conditions, we are able to find a 
reproducible critical velocity for prompt 
ignition of steady silane releases for different 
vent diameters. If the releases are reduced to 
below the critical velocity, prompt ignition of 
silane release is ensured. Above this critical 
velocity, silane can be released indefinitely 
into air without any ignition. The critical 
velocity is found to vary with the vent diameter. 
This relationship between the critical exit 
velocity and the vent diameter suggests that the 
silane release without prompt ignition was 
most likely caused by quench of the reactive 
kernel from the scalar dissipation between the 
release gas and the ambient air. These results 
will be useful in the developing better silane 
safety systems and operation practices that 
help to prevent the occurrence of silane 
explosion. This report summarizes the most 
important results from this three-year project. 
 
Keywords: Silane, autoignition, jet release, 
explosion 
 
1. Introduction 
Silane is one of the most widely used 
 4
In addition to the above release studies, 
there are a number of studies on silane 
combustion mechanism, e.g. Hartman et al. 
(1986), Britten et al. (1990), Babushok et al. 
(1998), Kondo et al. (2000) and Donovan et al. 
(2005). Nevertheless, these studies focus more 
on finding the chemical mechanism of silane 
combustion that leads to autoignition. Delayed 
ignition of silane release into air is an 
interaction between flow and chemical 
reactions, and remains to be studied. Several 
theories have been proposed to explain the 
mechanism of silane release without ignition. 
Cruice (1988) proposed that sufficient air can 
be entrained into a high speed silane jet to 
quench the oxidation reaction and scatter the 
exothermic energy through many layers of 
partially reacted silane, thus leaving a large 
amount of silane unreacted. Tamanini and 
Chaffee (1996a) believed the flow strain’s 
quenching, i.e. turbulent mixing, of the 
chemical reaction is probably the main reason 
why silane release into air does not autoignite. 
They proposed that the existence of a critical 
jet velocity for autoignition can be justified on 
physical arguments: Near the jet origin, while 
the silane concentration is most likely higher 
than the value at which stable mixtures are 
possible, the flow strain from shear which is 
proportional to the jet velocity to diameter 
ratio is also high, due to the high velocities and 
small jet diameter. At increasing distances 
from the jet source, velocity and silane 
concentration both decrease and the jet 
diameter increases (therefore, the flow strain 
decreases). If autoignition does not occur, this 
means that in the jet there is not a combination 
of a sufficiently high silane concentration and 
low flow strain to satisfy the autoignition 
condition. If the flow rate of the jet is 
decreased, the velocity and the flow strain both 
decrease. Autoignition then occurs when the 
drop in overall strain in the flow allows for a 
sufficiently low strain to develop at a location 
in the jet where the silane concentration is 
above the critical value for a stable mixture. 
However, Tamanini and Chaffee (1996a) did 
not report an exact critical velocity for delayed 
ignition in their studies but instead 
recommended a minimum of 50 psig for 
delayed ignition.  
Critical velocity for prompt ignition of 
silane release has been studied by Britton 
(1990) for pure silane, and Koda et al. (1986) 
and Tokuhashi et al. (1998) for nitrogen diluted 
silane. Britton (1990) reported critical velocity 
for pure silane near 0°C in the range of 10-20 
m/s, with values up to 50 m/s for a release 
from a 12.7 mm tube at a temperature of 6°C. 
Data from the 1/4- inch tube are least 
consistent and not reported. Koda et al. (1986) 
performed ignition studies for nitrogen diluted 
silane by using a counter flame device. Critical 
velocity for prompt ignition is determined to 
be in the range of 0.1~0.7 m/s for silane 
concentration from 1.9~4.6%. Tokuhashi et al. 
(1998) performed ignition studies for nitrogen 
diluted silane by using co-axial tubing. They 
reported critical ignition velocity of 0.1~0.26 
m/s for silane concentration from 1.7~2.8%, 
depending on the moisture contents. To date, 
there remains lack of consistent studies on the 
ignition behavior of pure silane. This work 
presents a series of tests that aims to uncover 
the precise condition for prompt ignition of 
pure silane release into air. The results will be 
useful in uncover the mechanism and condition 
of silane ignition upon release into air and 
provide better safety design and operation of 
silane. 
 
2. Release Configurations 
2.1 Dynamic Release Rig 
In the first part of the tests, a dynamic 
release rig was built and aimed to study the 
effect of release pressure on the silane ignition 
behavior. A one liter pressure vessel rated at 
125 bara was used as the silane source vessel. 
The vessel was connected to an automatic 
valve through a 1/4-inch tube with an internal 
diameter of 4.32 mm and a length of 15 cm. 
Between the valve and the vessel, a pressure 
transducer was mounted through a tee 
 6
point of release up to ignition. These videos 
helped to determine the exact time delay 
between silane out and ignition. In selected 
cases, an ultra high speed video camera with a 
recording rate of 20,000 frames/second was 
used to resolve the fine structure during 
ignition. 
The silane used was semiconductor grade 
with purity of 99.9999% in cylinder from Air 
Products Sanfu Gas Co. Prior to release, the 
system tubing and vessels were prepared by 
pulling a thorough vacuum and purged with 
high purity nitrogen (99.9999%). All tests were 
carried out at silane source temperature of 
26±2˚C and air temperature also of 26±2˚C. 
The difference between the silane source 
temperature and air temperature was normally 
less than 1˚C. Relative air humidity was in the 
range of 55±10%. 
2.3 Variable Temperature Release Design 
To vary the silane temperature, the silane 
flow after the switching valve is passing 
through a horizontal, jacketed tube with 2-m in 
length which cools or heats the silane to the 
desire temperature. A thermocouple is welded 
into the end of the jacketed tube to measure the 
silane temperature before the vent stub as 
shown in Figure 3. Actual measurement with 
nitrogen flow through the tube suggests that 
temperature of the gas can be controlled to an 
accuracy of ±0.5°C. The ambient condition is 
maintained at 28±1°C with relative humidity 
of 55±10%. Critical exit velocity for 
delayed/prompt ignition is determined for 
silane temperature varied from 0 to 50°C. In all 
tests, the vent stub is a standard Swagelok port 
connector with inner diameter of 4.32 mm. The 
stub is always replaced after each test to 
prevent any interference from the ignition 
products.  
2.4 Variable Ambient Moisture Release 
Design 
For moisture effects, most moisture 
comes from the ambient air rather in the silane 
gas. Kondo et al. (2000) proposed that a trace 
amount of water vapor enhances the 
occurrence of spontaneous ignition at room 
temperature. Donovan et al. (2005) used the 
kinetic mechanism from Kondo et al. (2000) 
assuming a moisture content around 270 ppm 
in their test and simulation. Thus, to validate 
the role of moisture, it is desired to have 
release tests with moisture content well below 
270 ppm. To achieve such a low moisture level 
in the ambient air, the plexglass chamber is 
replaced by a stainless steel chamber with a 
cross-sectional dimension of 0.42m(W) 
0.33m(H) as shown in Figure 4. The chamber 
has three parts: the first section with a length 
of 0.3 m in which the low moisture air is fed 
from the top; the second section with a length 
of 0.495 m in which the silane tube is inserted 
to the chamber center; the third section with a 
length of 0.275 m in which the cross-section is 
reduced to 0.205m (W)  0.15m (H). The 
contraction reduces the ingress of outside air 
and helps to control the moisture in the 
chamber. Two sets of sight glass were also 
installed in second section to allow 
visualization of the ignition. After each test, 
the chamber is dismantled, cleaned, and dried 
before used again. Four identical chambers 
were built to allow continuing testing. 
Ultrapure air from a cylinder with dew point of 
-110°C is used as the low moisture air source. 
The air flowrate is limited to 200 slpm such 
that air velocity in the chamber is less than 
0.03 m/s. To eliminate any possible moisture 
condensation on the chamber wall, the 
ultrapure air is passing through a vessel heated 
to 50°C before feeding into and flushing the 
chamber. Moisture is measured at the chamber 
exit until the air in the chamber is below dew 
point of -50°C or 40 ppmv moisture. In all low 
moisture tests, the silane temperature is 
maintained at 28±2°C while the air in the 
chamber is also maintained at 28±2°C. 
 
 
3. Results 
3.1 Dynamic Release  
 8
subjected to disturbances from valve switching, 
ignition occurs very close to the tube exit 
igniting the released silane/air mixture causing 
a small explosion, commonly called pop, see 
Figure 7(a). The lowest exit velocity that gives 
indefinitely delayed ignition is called the 
critical exit velocity. Note that in the release 
tests, it is still possible to have finite delayed 
ignition for a gas flow above the critical exit 
velocity. The finite delayed ignitions are 
mostly caused by a flow disturbance or particle 
contamination in the ambient air or the vent 
tubing. Silane combustion particle products 
have been known to be an ignition source for 
silane (Ngai et al., 2007). 
At flow velocity below 4.43 m/s, the 
releases always result in prompt ignition. 
Prompt ignition is defined as the ignition that 
occurs within 0.5 second from the point in 
which silane is initially released into air. As 
the gas densities of silane and air are different, 
silane reaching to the tube exit can be readily 
identified from the shadowgraph. However as 
the silane release is preceded by nitrogen at the 
same flow rate, there is a finite time of axial 
diffusion between silane and nitrogen. The 
selection of 0.5 second as the criterion for 
prompt ignition ensures that pure silane is 
released without the interference from axial 
mixing of silane and nitrogen. The ignition 
kernel during prompt ignition evolves into a 
flame by two different modes. At flow 
velocities below 1.3 m/s (see Figure 2(d)), the 
ignition kernel is a weak flame and evolves 
slowly into a conic shape of a laminar 
diffusion flame. At higher velocities such as in 
Figure 7(b) and 7(c), the ignition kernel is 
almost spherical with a strong flame which 
propagates rapidly in both upstream and 
downstream directions. The rapid propagation 
also creates a small popping sound.  
Another important feature in prompt 
ignition cases is that the ignition kernel can be 
remote from the tube exit. In fact, the clips in 
Figure 7 show that the ignition distance, 
defined as the distance between the ignition 
kernel and the tube exit, is roughly 
proportional to the silane flow velocity for the 
cases of prompt ignition. Thus, the ignition 
distance is determined from the first clip of 
high speed video for all prompt ignition cases. 
The result for 4.32 mm port connectors is 
shown in Figure 8. The ignition distance for 
indefinitely delayed ignitions is set to zero in 
Figure 8 to illustrate the indefinitely delayed 
ignition limit. The linear relationship between 
the ignition distance and silane flow velocity is 
confirmed. However, at a velocity above 4 m/s, 
the ignition distance is scattered. Interestingly, 
the Reynolds number at this velocity is about 
2050, just slightly above the turbulent jet 
criterion.   
The result for 3.86 mm tubes is shown in 
Figure 9. At exit velocity below 3.99 m/s, the 
releases always result in prompt ignition. The 
ignition distance is also found to be 
proportional to the silane flow rate up to the 
indefinitely delayed ignition limit. The 
Reynolds number at the delayed ignition limit 
is 1926, still a laminar jet. The result for 3.5 
mm tubes is shown in Figure 10. At exit 
velocity below 1.79 m/s, the releases always 
results in prompt ignition. The ignition 
distance is again proportional to the silane flow 
velocity up to the indefinitely delayed ignition 
limit. For other tube diameters, the ignition 
distance is not determined as the flow rate is 
low and the ignition kernel is very close to the 
tube exit. Only the critical exit velocity for 
indefinitely delayed ignition limit is 
determined and is discussed later in the paper.  
In selected cases, an ultra high speed video 
camera with a recording rate of 20,000 
frames/second was used to resolve the fine 
structure during ignition. Figures 11 and 12 
show some of the video clips of shadowgraph 
that correspond to delayed ignition and prompt 
ignition, respectively. For the indefinitely 
delayed ignition case, it is clear from Figure 
11(a) that the silane release forms a turbulent 
jet. During flow switching, the jet intensity 
diminishes as shown in Figure 11(b), then 
 10
Autoignition in a mixing flow of fuel and 
oxidizer has been a fundamental problem in 
combustion science (Mastorakos, 2009). The 
diesel engine is one of the examples in which 
combustion is initiated from autoignition of 
flammable releases. In a steady, laminar 
non-premixed flame, it is mostly the balance 
between diffusion and chemistry that 
determines the combustion. It has been found 
that a high strain rate or scalar dissipation rate 
can preclude the autoignition of a fuel flowing 
against hot air. (Mastorakos, 2009). The strain 
rate is defined as the normal gradient of the 
normal component of the flow velocity while 
the scalar dissipation rate is related to gradient 
of mixture fraction defined as (Bilger, 2005): 
     D  (2) 
where 　 is the fraction of fuel to air and D is 
the molecular diffusivity. The scalar 
dissipation rate is a measure of the rate of 
mixing on the molecular scale and is a central 
concept in turbulent non-premixed combustion. 
Both strain rate and scalar dissipation rate have 
the same unit of time-1. In the laminar 
counterflow configurations, the scalar 
dissipation is proportional to the strain rate and 
additionally depends on position across the 
layer. Thus, the two terms can be used almost 
interchangeably, but when considering 
turbulent flows it is preferable to use the scalar 
dissipation rate, since high fluid mechanical 
strain rates will not necessarily imply high 
scalar dissipation rates in a well-mixed 
turbulent flow (Mastorakos, 2009).  
For a fuel jet released into air, the scalar 
dissipation at the fuel jet/air surface near the 
origin is so large that reactive kernel will be 
quenched. Downstream of the jet, the scalar 
dissipation between the jet and surrounding air 
weakens and the ignition is a result of 
competition between the reactive kernel and 
the scalar dissipation. Further downstream in 
the jet, the reactive kernel is diminished along 
with reduced fuel concentration and 
autoignition is impossible. Strain rate or scalar 
dissipation is also known to induce extinction 
of hydrogen-air counterflow diffusion flames 
(Pellett et al., 1998) and the extinction and 
autoignition of n-heptane in counterflow 
configuration (Seiser et al., 2000), and is thus a 
central concept in the study of non-premixed 
flame.  
Based on the above short review of 
existing work on autoignition in other fuel 
systems, it is reasonable to postulate that the 
mechanism of silane delayed ignition upon 
release into air bears the same mechanism, 
namely the delayed ignition at high jet velocity 
is a result of excessive scalar dissipation or 
flow strain that quench the ignition kernel and 
prevent the ignition from occurring. With 
sufficient strain rate, the ignition kernel can be 
quenched indefinitely and the released silane 
simply mixed with air without any reaction.  
Figure 15 shows the results of critical exit 
velocity as a function of vent diameter. The 
critical exit velocity shown is based on the 
observed lowest velocity that gives indefinitely 
delayed ignition. The critical exit velocity is 
found to vary with the vent diameter to the 
power of 3.75. For a uniform jet flow, the 
global strain rate varies as jet velocity divided 
by diameter, U/D. Thus, it is expected that the 
critical flow velocity for delayed ignition 
would be varying linearly with the vent 
diameter. However, the non-linear relationship 
between critical velocity and vent diameter in 
Figure 15 suggests that the actual quenching 
condition is more complicated than the 
prediction from simple global strain rate 
expression. One of the possible causes is the 
non-uniform velocity profile of the jet and the 
highly complicated mixing flow between the 
jet and the air. The simple boundary layer 
approximation of Schlichting (1979) has 
known to reproduce poorly the realistic 
flow/mixing fields for the simple case of 
laminar jet flow. Instead, at least a numerical 
solution of two dimensional continuity, 
momentum, and species equations is required 
to gain the local scalar dissipation rate (Chen 
 12
port connector with ID of 2.03 mm.  
Figure 18 shows the results of the critical 
velocity for delayed/prompt ignition as a 
function of vent size under extremely low 
humidity ambient air condition. Figure 18 also 
includes the results from Figure 15 for the 
cases of normal ambient air. Clearly, the 
moisture in the normal ambient air plays an 
inhibitory role on the silane ignition in air. 
Removing the moisture in the air resulted in 
significantly higher critical velocities for all 
tested vent stubs.  
For a uniform jet flow, the global strain 
rate varies as jet velocity divided by diameter, 
U/D. Thus, it is expected that the critical flow 
velocity for delayed ignition would be varying 
linearly with the vent diameter. Figure 19 
shows that a preliminary check of flow strain 
rate, defined as the ratio of critical velocity to 
vent size, is roughly constant over the tested 
vent sizes for the low moisture tests. Also 
shown in Figure 19 is the same result for the 
normal moisture tests which varies 
significantly with vent size. For the low 
moisture cases, the flow strain requires to 
quench the silane ignition is higher than the 
cases of normal moisture. The difference 
between the two cases suggests again that the 
moisture in the ambient air plays a significant 
role in the silane prompt ignition. If moisture 
in the entrained air play a determining role in 
the ignition, a smaller jet will be easier to be 
quenched by the moisture in the air in addition 
to the jet flow strain. Without moisture in the 
entrained air, the quench is caused by a purely 
fluid dynamical action and the quench required 
should be constant for different vent diameters. 
The quench effect of the moisture also renders 
the variation in flow strain for different vent 
diameters and thus the nonlinear relationship 
between the critical velocity and the vent 
diameters for the normal moisture tests. 
Figure 20 shows the volumetric flow ratio 
of air entrainment to the silane flow at the 
ignition location under low moisture condition. 
The air entrainment rate is calculated by the 
analytical expression of Schlichting (1979) 
which is valid only for laminar flow. The ratio 
is scattered around a constant of 0.5250.027 
up to silane flow Reynolds number of 2000. At 
Re>2000, the flow is no longer laminar and a 
numerical simulation is required to calculate 
the entrainment rate. The constant volumetric 
flow ratio of air entrainment to the silane flow 
suggests that the most reactive ignition kernel 
occurs when silane concentration reaching 
about 1/(1+0.525) or 65.6%. This 
concentration is lower than the value of 75.6% 
in normal ambient air with moisture.  
The inhibitory action of water on the H2-O2 
explosion is a well known phenomenon (von 
Elbe and Lewis, 1937). In methane and 
hydrogen autoignition in air, the role of water 
is also confirmed to be inhibitory (Seiser and 
Seshadri, 2005). Thus, the present results of 
confirming the inhibitory action of moisture on 
the silane autoigniton in air is also in consistent 
with other fuel such as hydrogen and methane. 
Combining the present studies on low 
moisture and temperature effects suggests that 
the silane prompt ignition behavior in air is 
strongly affected by the moisture in the air. In 
fact, the results of temperature dependence and 
activation energy at ignition is not only related 
to the silane/oxygen combustion mechanism, 
but also related to water inhibitory mechanism 
on silane/oxygen combustion. To find the true 
activation energy for silane/oxygen reaction at 
ignition, it would require tests with controller 
silane temperature and controlled moisture. 
Also, it is necessary to characterize the exact 
effects of moisture through systematic studies 
on the ignition behavior in different moisture 
levels. These issues will be addressed in our 
future work. 
From a safety perspective, silane prompt 
ignition is favored in high temperature, low 
humidity environment. The present results of 
strong effects of temperature and moisture on 
the silane ignition reactions also helps to 
explain in part the unpredictability of silane 
ignition behavior in different incidents or 
release tests.

always occurs in a well-defined mixture 
fraction called the most reactive mixture 
fraction. Critical velocities for delayed ignition 
for different vent sizes are determined. 
Mechanism of silane delayed ignition is also 
discussed and compared with autoignition in 
other fuels. 
Critical exit velocity for delayed/prompt 
ignition is also determined for pure silane 
release into ambient air with silane temperature 
varied from 0 to 50 degree Celsius. With the 
assumption of Arrhenius law, the logarithm of 
critical exit velocity is found to proportional to 
the inverse of silane temperature. The 
activation energy is determined to be 10.08 
kCal/mol. A low moisture chamber is built to 
simulate the low moisture air with moisture 
below 40 ppmv. It is found that moisture in the 
air has a strong inhibiting effect on the silane 
autoignition in air. Without the interference 
from moisture, the global stain rate of the 
critical exit velocity for different vent diameter 
is found to be roughly a constant. Most 
reactive concentration is also found to be 
65.6% which is lower than the value of 75.6% 
in normal ambient air with moisture. 
 
6. Self-Assessment of the Project 
This project has achieved its original goal, 
i.e. to find the mechanism and condition for 
silane release into air with/without prompt 
ignition. In addition, the effects of temperature 
and moisture on the ignition behaviour are also 
studied. A total of 2 SCI articles and 5 
international conference articles has generated 
from this project. This project also cultivated 1 
PhD and 2 MSc students. The final part results 
of this project is planning to be published 
within one year. It is believed that this project 
has achieved more than its original goal and its 
results will continue to impact the 
semiconductor and related industries with 
better silane safety. The project team sincerely 
appreciated National Science Council for 
supporting this project.

1. Introduction  
 
Silane is one of the most widely used silicon source gases used in the semiconductor, 
TFT-LCD, and photovoltaic industries. Silane is also a well known pyrophoric gas which 
normally ignites upon in contact with air. The major potential hazard of silane is however not 
in its pyrophoricity but rather in its unpredictable ignition behaviour. A silane release from a 
pressure source has been known not to lead to spontaneously ignition (Koda, 1992) and 
frequently delayed ignition occurs when the release is shut-off resulting in a “pop”. In a semi-
confined space with gas accumulation, the pop can lead to a gas explosion with significant 
damage (Ngai et al., 2007). Chen et al. (2006) and Chang et al. (2007) have reported a 
destructive silane explosion that is caused by the release and delayed ignition and explosion 
from a silane cylinder. The incident stressed the importance of understanding the mechanism 
of delayed ignition from silane release.  
Delayed ignition of silane release into air is an interaction between flow and chemical 
reactions, and remains to be studied. Several theories have been proposed to explain the 
mechanism of silane release without ignition. For example, Tamanini and Chaffee (1996) 
proposed that flow strain’s quenching, i.e. turbulent mixing, of the chemical reaction is 
probably the main reason why silane release into air does not autoignite. However, Tamanini 
and Chaffee (1996) did not report a critical velocity for delayed ignition in their studies but 
instead recommended a minimum of 50 psig for delayed ignition.  
To date, there remains lack of consistent studies on the ignition behaviour of pure 
silane. This work presents a series of tests that aims to determine the precise condition for 
delayed ignition of pure silane release into air. The results will be useful in developing better 
silane safety design and operation practices. 
 
2. Release Configurations 
 
In the first part of the tests, a dynamic release rig was built and aimed to study the 
effect of release pressure on the silane ignition behaviour. A one litre pressure vessel was 
used as the silane source vessel. The vessel was connected to an automatic valve through a 
1/4-inch tube. Downstream of the valve was a cross connector connected to a pressure 
transducer, a purging manifold, and a 3 cm short tube or a restricted orifice for venting. The 
silane release therefore underwent a rapid ramping of velocity to a maximum rate, followed 
by a steady flow for release from a restricted orifice or flow decay for release from a tube.  
For the steady release tests, a mass flow meter and a pressure regulator were used 
in the downstream of the pressure vessel. A parallel flow of nitrogen was set at the same 
flow rate as silane. An electrically controlled four-way switching valve was used to 
simultaneously switch the silane flow to the vent line and the nitrogen to the burn box once 
the desired silane flow has been established and is steady. At end of the 6 m vent line, a 
section of 3 cm tube with different internal diameter of 2.03, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 3.86 and 4.32 mm 
were connected to the vent line as the vent stub.

3.3 Analysis of Most Reactive Ignition Kernel 
As the silane release is in the form of a jet, it is possible to check the amount of air 
entrained into the silane jet. In a laminar, axisymmetric jet flow into a static medium, the flow 
rate created by the jet is given by the following analytical expression (Schlichting, 1979): 
 Q=8x/ , (1)  
where Q is the volumetric flow rate of air entrained, x is the downstream distance in the jet,  
is the viscosity of air, and  is the density of air. Namely, the entrainment of ambient air 
depends only on the downstream distance of the jet. In combining with the measured ignition 
distance, it is found that volumetric flow ratio of air entrainment to the silane flow at the 
ignition location is scattered around a constant of 0.3220.076 up to silane flow Reynolds 
number of 2000 as shown in Figure 3. At Re>2000, the jet is no longer laminar and the air 
entrainment expression of Eq. (1) is no longer hold.

Mastorakos et al. (1997) performed numerical simulation of autoignition of 
methane/air in laminar and turbulent mixing flow and found that ignition always occurs at a 
well-defined mixture fraction called the most reactive mixture fraction. The fraction depends 
only on the fuel and oxidant temperatures and the activation energy in laminar flow. Our 
results in Figure 3 are thus in consistent with autoignition of the fuel system described by 
Mastorakos et al. (1997). It has also been found that a high strain rate or scalar dissipation 
rate can preclude the autoignition of a fuel flowing against hot air. (Mastorakos, 2009). The 
strain rate is defined as the normal gradient of the normal component of the flow velocity 
while the scalar dissipation rate is related to gradient of mixture fraction. The scalar 
dissipation rate is a measure of the rate of mixing on the molecular scale (Mastorakos, 2009). 
It is reasonable to postulate that the mechanism of silane delayed ignition upon release into 
air bears the same mechanism as other fuel systems, namely the delayed ignition at high jet 
velocity is a result of excessive scalar dissipation or flow strain that quench the ignition kernel 
and prevent the ignition from occurring.  
Figure 4 shows the results of critical exit velocity as a function of vent diameter. The 
critical exit velocity shown is based on the observed lowest velocity that gives indefinitely

1. Introduction 
 
 Hydrocarbon oxidation by air/oxygen is an important class of chemical reactions in 
the modern chemical industries. For example, the liquid phase oxidation of p-xylene by air or 
oxygen is the major route for producing of terephthalic acid. The liquid phase oxidation of 
cyclohexane by air is an important route for producing cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, and 
adipic acid. The vapour phase oxidation of ethylene is the major route for producing ethylene 
oxide. In fact, the above three examples have constituted the polyester and Nylon fiber 
industries. Safety has been a major concern for hydrocarbon oxidation owing to it potential to 
undergo uncontrolled oxidation, or the explosion or deflagration reaction, with oxygen. The 
deflagration reaction will rapidly raise the pressure and temperature in the reactor and result 
in severe chemical release, fire and explosion (Kletz, 1988). Traditional process development 
usually involves explosion testing at the process conditions with exotic pressure and 
temperature which can only be done in specially designed systems, e.g. Vanderstraeten 
(1997) or Chen and Liu (2003).Developing a complete flammability envelope at the process 
conditions is usually difficult and very time consuming. Normally, only the fuel/oxidant 
compositions near the operating conditions are tested to ensure a safe operation. Deviations 
from the process condition are usually done in a HAZOP studies rather than tested in 
explosion testing.  
This article present a systematic method based on flammability diagram for designing 
hydrocarbon oxidation processes. Based on flammability diagram, three different operations 
are possible for avoiding deflagration during oxidation: fuel-rich, fuel-lean and oxygen-lean. 
In fuel-rich operations, the fuel vapour concentration is always kept above the upper 
flammability limit (UFL). In fuel-lean operations, the fuel vapour concentration is always 
maintained below the lower flammability limit (LFL). In oxygen-lean operations, the amount of 
oxygen added is kept to below Limiting Oxygen Concentration (LOC) regardless of the 
amount of fuel or inert in the system. Practical examples are provided and to illustrate the 
controlling safety features for the above three systems. The results will help chemists and 
engineers in selecting better and safer operation conditions for hydrocarbon oxidation 
processes. 
 
2. Classification of Non-Flammable Zone in Flammability Diagram 
 
The flammability diagram has been widely used as an indication of flammability for a 
specific fuel/oxidant/inert composition (Crwol and Louvar, 2002). The flammability diagram 
can be plotted from experimental data or from data points of UFL in air, UFL in oxygen, LOC, 
LFL in air, and LFL in oxygen (Crwol and Louvar, 2002). The non-flammable zone is divided 
into three distinct zones: fuel rich, fuel lean and oxygen lean as shown in Figure 1. The 
oxygen lean zone is obtained by linking the pure fuel point with a straight line to the LOC and 
extended to the inert gas axis. The fuel rich zone is the area between UFL line and the left 
boundary of oxygen lean zone. The fuel lean zone is the area between LFL line and the left 
boundary of oxygen lean zone. Each of these non-flammable zones features the key 
parameter that controlling the zone as non-flammable. In fuel rich zone, only deviations with 
30% propylene, 6.4% oxygen, 7.1% acetic acid, 14.3% water, and 42.2% nitrogen, all in 
volume percent. Initial temperature and pressure were fixed at of 438.15 K and 0.5 MPa, 
respectively. The mixture enters flammable zone when oxygen concentration is increased to 
18.4% while maintaining other feeds at the same ratio. 
To apply the flammability diagram, we lump the acetic acid and propylene as the fuel, 
water and nitrogen as the inert gases. The mixture LFL is estimated to be 2.68 vol% from the 
Le Chatelier’s mixing rule using the LFLs of propylene and acetic acid at ambient condition. 
The LOC of propylene and acetic acid are both estimated to be 10.8 vol% from the product of 
respective LFL and stoichiometric ratio. LFL has been known to be less affected by pressure 
or temperature compared with UFL. The UFL in pure oxygen is determined to be 71.5 vol% 
from the extension of the line connecting the known flammable point and the LOC. The 
flammable boundary is plotted using the estimated UFL in pure oxygen, LFL, and LOC as 
shown in Figure 3. It is clear from Figure 3 that the current operating condition falls into the 
oxygen lean regime. Thus, only excessive oxygen feed can bring the operating condition to 
the flammable zone. The oxygen feed should be monitored carefully and linked to 
emergency shutoff of oxygen feed. It is also possible to increase the productivity without 
compromise in safety by decreasing the feed rate of inert gases while maintaining the 
oxygen and fuel ratio as shown in the green line in Figure 3.

4. Example 2 – Liquid-phase oxidation in ethyl acetate solvent with pure oxygen 
 
The second example concerns a proprietary process of oxidizing a chemical 
intermediate. The intermediate is a solid and can be dissolved in ethyl acetate (EA). The 
oxidation is carried out by bubbling air or pure oxygen through the EA solution at ambient or 
elevated pressure and temperature no greater than 70°C. Preliminary tests in small 
laboratory scale show that increasing oxygen partial pressure and reaction temperature 
favour reaction rate. The typical reaction time for bubbling air at a temperature of 50°C is 
about 100 hr. The reaction time reduced drastically to less than 20 hr when pure oxygen was 
used. Thus, the use of pure oxygen is preferred. 
In a liquid-phase oxidation reaction, the fuel comes from vaporization and is thus 
controlled by the liquid temperature. The oxygen concentration in the reactor headspace is 
controlled by the oxygen partial pressure. When pure oxygen is used, the unreacted gases 
contain the solvent vapour and oxygen. Based on the flammability diagram, the liquid 
temperature must be maintained at least above 55°C to stay away from the flammable 
boundary, a fuel-rich operation. Figure 4(a) shows the flammable boundary based on LOC, 
LFL and UFL data at ambient condition. However, as the fuel concentration is controlled by 
temperature, any cooling in the headspace wall or vapour line will rapidly bring the mixture

Summary from cylinder valve tests
Silane normally will not autoignite from high pressure 
releases.
As flow rate and/or pressure is reduced it can ignite. 
The ignition will pose a significant explosion hazard in 
a confined space such as a gas cabinet or a gas 
room. 
As it is impossible to prevent the ignition at reduced 
flow, it is recommended to evacuate all personnel 
including emergency response team if such release       
occurred.
Tests do not have sufficient data to define prompt/ 
delayed ignition conditions. Various experimental 
designs have been attempted to uncover the 
conditions.

Most reactive fraction:
The ratio of air entrainment and silane flow ate is found 
to be a constant of 0.322 (silane conc 75.6%) at the 
ignition locations for all prompt ignition cases. 
This fraction is the most reactive fraction that initiates 
the combustion chain reactions, always in the jet center.

The condition for silane delayed ignition depends on 
flow velocity which in term depends on the vent sizes, 
ambient temperature and moisture
Conclusions
Higher temperature and lower moisture in the ambient 
air promote the autoignition of silane release
Release and delayed ignition may lead to severe 
explosion 
No device (e.g. RFO) can guarantee silane release 
with prompt ignition  
Delayed ignition should be considered as a normal 
case. All efforts must be made to prevent silane 
accumulation, e.g. using open cylinder rack rather 
than cylinder cabinet
