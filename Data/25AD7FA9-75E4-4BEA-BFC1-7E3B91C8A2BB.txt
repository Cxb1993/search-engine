二、簡介 
船體運動度雖不快，但在碰撞與擱淺
時，龐大的船體質量形成龐大動能衝擊船體
結構，造成大範圍的結構損壞。碰撞與擱淺
可造成嚴重的船殼損壞，並導致沈船與大規
模海洋污染等災難。為避免船體破裂造成的
油污災害。美國海岸巡防署在1990年代即強
力導入油輪雙層殼設計以避免油輪船側遭
撞擊時，外殼破裂導致油污外洩。
Papantkolaou et al (2006)分析油輪的意外事
件，顯示主要仍以碰撞為主、其次為擱淺；
國際海事組織(International Maritime 
Organization，簡稱IMO)在一致化規範及設
計合理化計畫(IMO project Harmonization of 
Rule and Design Rational)中更新的2946件船
舶意外事件中，1851件碰撞、930件擱淺、
其他意外事件為165件。20年來船舶碰撞與
擱淺相關的結構損壞問題成為國際上重要
的研究課題(Jones & Jouri 1987，Kitamura 
2002，Lehmann & Peschmann 2002， 
Pedersen & Zhang 2000，Pedersen et al 
1983，Rodd 1996，Alghamdi 2001)。船舶及
海洋工程結構的碰撞及其後續事故的探討
在ISSC中自1991年起即列為重要研究項
目，到2006年起在過去研究成果的背景之下
開始思考防撞結構與撞擊後的船體剩餘強
度與穩度的預估，以及緊急修護措施，以提
高船舶的安全性(ISSC 2009 Committee V.1 
report)。 
水下爆炸對結構衝擊，如海上鑽油系統
產生之水下油氣爆炸，或船艦遭受水下武器
攻擊等，結構的高速衝擊反應，為近年來開
始受重視的領域。由於船體結構的複雜性，
在碰撞與擱淺過程，或衝擊爆震歷程，結構
的破壞狀況非常複雜，其各項結構件的破壞
為多種破壞模式的組合。 
由於鋼材的高韌性，鋼材三明治板結構
以金屬夾心隔開雙層板，如加上表面貼皮，
在多種研究顯示其具備承受短暫高負荷的
潛力。近年頗多研究探討其高速度衝擊下優
越的吸能特性，其探討空氣中或水中的爆震
波峰值在 100Mpa 的量級，持續時間在
~100 sμ ，空氣爆震波如 Nermat-Nasser et al 
(2007)，Rathbun et al (2006)，McShane et al 
(2006)，Theobald & Nurick (2007)，Radford 
etal (2006)等，水下爆炸如 Fleck & Deshpand 
(2004), Xue & Hutchison (2004)，Qui et al 
(2003 & 2005)等。尤其水下爆炸之流固藕合
更發揮部分效果如 Taylor(1947)。鋼材三明
治板結構抗爆震研究目前文獻上呈現者仍
以基礎研究為主，重點在試驗模型的研製，
小模型試驗如周圍固定圓板，或三明治結構
樑，或三明治桁架管狀芯材研究等，試驗與
FE-分析同時進行比較。鋼材三明治結構的
動態特性與芯材組合有關，其研究頗有針對
性，非屬通用型研究，其動態特性與抗爆震
特性應有關聯，值得研究。 
金屬三明治板結構具有重量效率
(Ashby等2000)與耐撞擊與耐震擊之特性
（Fleck & Deshpande 2004；Xue & 
Hutchinson 2004）。有效的製造技術持續在
發展中( Wadely et al 2003)，其夾心結構則
有多種構想，如蜂槽式（Rathbun et al 2006）,
金字塔形式或4面體桁架(Chiras et al 2002；
Zok et al 2004)等。 
常見的船用金屬三明治結構為雙層殼
板加上心材結構之結構型態，如潛艇之雙層
殼結構、船舶的雙層底和雙層殼結構均屬三
明治結構，其心材結構保留的空間可用來儲
存水和油料或作為管路通道。船體結構較早
使用之三明治結構為兩層殼中間以肋骨支
撐，如圖 1 以取代圖 2 之肋骨加強板。船體
結構較早使用之三明治結構為兩層殼中間
以肋板支撐，上世紀 50 年代 NASA 進行系
列研究以來，一般常用於輕結構。在理論的
探討與勁度指標的估算頗為謹慎，如
Fung(1996)、Lok (1999)等。1980 年代美國
海軍應用到天線上甲板，而降低 9 噸重量。
如圖 3與圖 4表現傳統肋骨加強結構與三明
治板塊結構之型態比較。 
但過去由於電銲技術與施工空間的限
制，三明治結構的製作不符經濟條件，只停

由於船體結構的複雜性，在碰撞與擱淺
過程，結構的破壞狀況非常複雜，其各項結
構件的破壞為多種破壞模式的組合。船舶撞
擊試驗不易以小模型進行，多以大型國家型
計畫，或跨國合作計畫來進行，提供相關研
究者作為比較的基準問題(benchmark 
problem)，（如Rodd 1996， Wevers & 
Vredevelt 1999,  Ehlers et al 2008）。近年
來船舶碰撞擊擱淺分析多採有非線性限元
素分析，但FEM分析模型需龐大計算資源，
建模與評估需頗長時間，因此在船舶碰撞研
究，頗多進行簡化模型分析，將結構的破壞
行為分解成基本破壞模式，依撞擊過程結構
接觸狀況分別估算結構件破壞的撞擊阻力
與破壞吸能，再逐次推算破壞結構區塊的整
體撞擊阻力與破壞吸能（Hung & Chen 
2007，Paik & Seo 2007，Pedersen & Zhang 
2000，Yamada & Pedersen 2008, Wang 
2000）。 
船舶碰撞最常發生者為船艏撞擊他船
之船側，一般船艏為尖銳部份，撞擊損傷情
況與撞擊船之船艏有很大關係，因此船艏之
撞擊特性也為抗撞問題需要掌握的重要課
題，Yagi et al (2009)探討尖銳船艏的撞擊特
性；Karlsson et al (2009)以試驗與分析探討
球型艏撞擊船側的現象；Yamada & 
Endo(2008) 以試驗與分析探討球型艏斜向
撞擊船側的現象；Endo & Yamada (2008)探
討緩衝型設計之船艏撞擊油輪，降低撞擊損
傷，以改善油污外洩問題；Yamada et al 
(2008)分析緩衝型設計之船艏在船舶碰撞時
之防撞效應。 
本文旨在探討船艏撞擊船側狀況下，不
同雙層殼結構遭船艏撞擊過程，結構件之變
形歷程與破壞狀況，歸納不同雙層殼結構之
抗撞能力。

相關試驗以及 Liu et al (2006)之桁架夾心結

Paik(1999)之研究模型：蜂槽夾心、桁架夾

不同型態雙層殼結構承受爆震波，內板

為評估標準。不同位置的最大加速度值如表
17 所示。在第一年分析以三明治板塊結構
之 UNDEX 分析，顯示桁架夾芯結構在爆震
波衝擊下的緩衝效果頗佳，但在雙層殼區塊
較大範圍分析結果卻顯出緩衝效果變差，且
有明顯爆震波引致振動現象。 
在內層板中央的部分，X 型夾芯結構爆
震衝擊最小，其次為 Y 型夾芯結構。夾心
後端內板或大肋骨緣板中央之結構爆震衝

2. 與雙層殼結構比較在外板破裂前肋骨

七、 結 論 
本研究為三年期計畫研究不同型態船
體鋼材三明治板結構之動態特性與抗撞性
能以及防爆功能研究。第一年先選擇船舶輕
結構可能採用之三種三明治結構與 ISSC 技
術委員會所提出之船舶與海洋工程結構可
用之三種三明治結構進行靜態分析、撞擊分
析與水下爆震分析，初步比較其降服負載、
挫曲負載、抗撞能力與抗爆震能力等特性，
並與傳統肋骨加強板結構的特性比較。 
第二年，對 6 種三明治結構以較大範圍
的船舶雙層殼結構區塊進行撞擊分析與水
下爆震分析。 
第三年先探討三種雙層殼及肋骨加強
結構造受球型艏撞擊的損壞狀況，也對於剛
質船艏及可潰式船艏結構撞擊過程撞擊反
力及能量消散進行分析比較。檢討不同船側
結構及不同縱向勁度船艏之抗撞能力。最後
選擇一 80,000噸貨櫃輪撞擊 140,000噸散裝
貨輪之個案進行分析，比較不同船艏勁度對
撞擊過程結構損壞之影響。 
由分析結果可歸納結論如下。 
7.1 第一年研究成果結論 
第一年以三明治板塊結構為研究比較對
象，結論如下： 
1. 在相同的靜態負載狀況，桁架夾心結構應
力最高，其次為肋板夾心結構，蜂巢夾心
結構與格板夾心結構差不多，X 型夾心結
構與肋骨加強板最低。 
2. 對於肋板或夾心的挫曲強度，肋骨加強板
最高，雙向交叉的夾心型態結構中桁架夾
心結構的挫曲強度最低，蜂巢夾心結構的
挫曲強度比格板夾心結構高。屬單向配置
夾心結構的肋板夾心結構、X 型夾心結構
與 Y 型夾心結構，其挫曲負載相近，但肋
板夾心的厚度較高、挫曲負載也較高。 
3. 撞擊體對結構的撞擊位置落在板塊中央
與落在夾心結構與版交叉位置，結構抗撞
能力也不相同。肋骨加強板撞擊點落在肋
骨與板的交線時，抗撞性較高，但三明治
結構則不一定。 
33 
 
(b) Y-型雙層殼結構之挫曲負載小於詳伏
負載，傳統肋骨加強結構之降伏負載
小於雙層殼結構。 
2. 撞擊過程三種雙層殼外板結構之破壞外
觀相似，肋板在外殼破壞前出現挫曲與
褶皺，因此在外殼破裂時撞擊深度及吸
收能量較傳統股加強板高。 
3. 非傳統 X-型及 Y-型肋板雙層殼結構在
內板破壞前之總反力及能量消散大於傳
統平板型肋板雙層殼與肋骨加強結構。  
4. 較諸Y-型雙層殼，X-型肋板雙層殼之降
伏負載相當但挫曲負載高出很多，在外
板破裂時Y-型肋板雙層殼略佳，但在內
板破裂時則X-型肋板雙層殼之抗撞能力
頗具優勢。 
5. 剛質船艏在外板破裂前總撞擊阻力遠高
於可潰船艏，被撞結構吸收能量略低。
但隨後撞擊反力降到可潰船艏範圍，只
有破壞結構吸收能量，因而能量消散較
低。 
6. 船艏勁度較高，撞擊船側過程，可能只
呈現局部挫曲，被撞船則造成明顯的破
壞，甚至內殼也出現破裂現象。船艏前
端勁度減弱，撞擊過程，則可呈現明顯
的挫曲與褶皺，被撞船則呈現外殼略大
範圍的凹陷，外殼出現小範圍的破壞，
而保持內殼並無破裂現象，提高貨品或
船內設施之安全等級。 
7. 船艏勁度不同，撞擊過程成緩衝能力也
不同，最佳船艏之設計有待進一步研究。

一、 前言 
1.1  ISSC 概況 
    國際船舶及海域結構大會(International Ship and Offshore Structure 
Congress)﹐簡稱 ISSC﹐為一國際性造船科技交流的組織﹐雖屬民間組織﹐
但以國家為單元來考慮組織的形成與委員之評選。自 1961 年召開第一屆
大會以來，今年之大會已為十七屆﹐每三年開一次大會，每次會會期 5
天，其中科技會議在後 4 天，第一天召開常務委員會事務性會議，常務委
員會與區域負責人聯席會議。

1.2 我國參與 ISSC 概況 
1961 年起，我國 correspondent 為勵汝尚教授，當時的時空背景，我
國有機會進入常務委員會，但我國有計畫培養造船人才剛開始，國內參與
較不積極。到 1985 本校李常聲教授接任 correspondent，才開始積極參與
ISSC，可惜大陸早一步進入常務委員會，我國只能保持台灣 correspondent
身份。當初在台大孫校長的經費協助下，李教授自 1985年自正式進入 ISSC
技術委員會，1988 本人與海大王偉輝教授也進入技術委員會，之後到 1998
的 ISSC 大會出國皆由教育部補助。 
1994 年李教授退休，基於校際平衡，由海洋大學王偉輝教授接任我
國 correspondent。2003 年王教授已屆滿三任，將台灣 correspondent 之職
交給本人。 
ISSC 是屬於國際合作性質的會議﹐並非個人性質的發表。各技術委
員會除大會外﹐原則上每年作 1 到 2 次期中會議﹐以檢討委員會報告的進
度與各國之間的相互配合。國內多年來在教育部的部分支持下﹐透過委員
們的努力﹐我國已在 ISSC 組織內紮根﹐爭取頗多國際友人對我們的肯定
與支持，目前我國有四位技術委員會委員，分別為本人，高海大呂學信教
授，聯設中心陳崇平，及台船公司簡惠龍等。 
 
二､參加經過 
    本屆 ISSC 大會的委員會由 2006 年在英國 Southhampton 召開的第十
六四屆大會所選出﹐我國擁有四個委員會的委員﹐即﹕ 
    呂學信教授（高海大）：Committee I.1 – 環境 
陳崇平先生(聯設)﹕Committee IV.2 - 設計方法 
    簡惠龍先生(台船)﹕Committee II.1 - 結構靜態反應 
    洪振發教授(台大)﹕Committee V.1 – 意外事件後之損壞評估 
    依 ISSC 的精神，每個委員會的委員應出席大會，觀察員為有潛力的
委員會委員候選人，ISSC 希望出席大會的人為具備一定程度以上的專家
出席 17thISSC 會報告.doc 5
    大會安排每個技術委員會與專題委員會有 25 分鐘的發表報告，15 分
鐘的正式檢討(official disscusion)，另外安排 30 分鐘的現場討論與 10 分鐘
委員會的回答。 
   筆者參與重點放在「擬靜 態分析」、「動態反應」、「設計原理與基準」、
「設計方法」、「極限強度」、「碰撞與擱淺」、「高速艇結構」與「結構疲勞
強度」等，最近兩三屆會議討論重點逐漸加入國際海事安全，國際船籍社
聯會、航運安全以及船舶設計與船東需求等相關較實務的議題，已非過去
以學術為主技術為輔的狀態。 
本次 ISSC 有多位常務委員到期，波蘭與丹麥願意讓出常務委員位
置，而徵求有意願參與常務委員會的國家，新加坡、希臘、巴西以及葡萄
牙代表頗為積極爭取。筆者也在徵詢之列，考慮退休年齡將屆，且國內對
ISSC 的支援頗為不足，又需與中國代表展開長時間的討論與協調，因而
放棄，結果新加坡、希臘、巴西以及葡萄牙代表都進入常務委員會。 
在 ISSC 各技術委員會中，委員名額有限，各國皆極力爭取，競爭非
常劇烈，此次我國出席的三位委員簡惠龍、陳崇平、與洪振發，均只任目
前委員會一屆，可繼續爭取連任原來的委員會。 
在大會期間常務委員會檢討新任委員會名單時，競爭非常劇烈。本
次技術委員會的選拔分兩次進行，首次在 8 月 16 日晚上的常務委員與地
區代表聯席會中進行初次遴選，我方除高海大呂學信教授表示其行政工作
繁忙，無法繼續參與 ISSC，其他三位委員我爭取留任，再增加黃建樺為
Ultimate Strength 委員會委員，周志明為 Material Fabrication 委員會委員，
方志中為負載委員會之委員，當時會場並無反對聲音。第二次遴選會為 8
月 19 日的常務委員會做最後決定。我方無常務委員會代表，無法在會場
力爭，台灣仍保持四個委員會委員。結果我與陳崇平繼續留任第二任，黃
建樺與周志明為新任委員。方志中博士並未出席此次大會，仍有多競爭者
有意爭取而被換掉。 
本人參加的技術委員會，探討意外事件後之損壞評估，這是一個非常廣泛
的課題，委員會成員學校與業界各佔一半，委員會主席為葡萄牙Carlos 
Guedes Soares教授，主持里斯本海洋科技研究中心，在造船界相當活躍，
出席 17thISSC 會報告.doc 7
義，反觀國內多數學會之理監事與委員會，幾乎一直就是一些相同面孔在
活動，而有血流不通、格局狹隘、思想閉塞之缺點，頗值得參考。 
本人過去參與 4 屆的設計方法技術委員會，工作重點放在資訊工程
( IT- information technology) 在造船設計、統計與製造之應用，到前屆開
始強調 IT 與各種技術之整合，而超出一般船廠所謂的 CAD/CAM 與生產
自動化，而探索廣泛的「知識」應用，這是頗值得注意的趨勢。  
上屆常務委會對軍艦結構與設備商規化非常重視，而成立 Naval Ship 
Design 專家委員會，檢討軍用艦艇之結構問題（包含：設計條件、設計
實務、結構設計、振動與噪音等），本屆仍然繼續，期待有更具體的建議。 
波浪與風力能源的開發雖非新課題，但最近歐美多國積極落實到工
業用途，而非早期的基本研究，配合歐盟許多國家把再生能源視為重要能
源政策，因此 Ocean Wave & Wind Energy 在專家委員會中，是一個熱門
課題。 
    整體來說，ISSC 以船舶與海域結構科技為核心，但不限於結構力學
與建造技術，包含船舶運輸安全與海域環境保護課題，純粹船體結構原理
與力學份量已相當程度減少，而加入船體結構生命週期之整體考量、風險
分析、與技術與應用的整合等項目之份量逐漸增加。另外 ISSC 新重視的
課題，如：艦艇結構商規化，風力與波浪能量的應用，極區科技、結構衝
擊負載及反應，以及遊艇結構設計等問題。國內造船界最近開始風力與波
浪能量的問題，與遊艇設計問題，此兩部份頗值得國內派員參與。其他國
內研究能量較小，頗值得注意。 
 
四、 建議 
1. ISSC 與 ITTC（國際拖曳水槽）為目前國際上船舶與海洋結構領域兩
個最重要的學術與技術組織，國際上與造船科技相關的國家參與非常
積極。目前 ISSC 常務委員會代表的國家有 15 國，設地區負責人的國
家有 18 國（如附件），預定擴增為 21 國。我國應積極參與，以表現
我國的研究成果與貢獻。 
2. ISSC 組織屬於個人參與而進行國際造船學術技術合作交流的形態，其
委員會的成員與觀察員的分配卻依國家、地區的分佈而定，並以各國

ISSC Committee V.1: Damage Assessment After Accidental Events 5  
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
This paper contains the report of the Committee, which is a new one that was created to 
deal with the methods to assess damage and residual strength after accidental events. 
The name of the committee, being a short one may give a wrong impression about its 
scope as it mentions damage assessment while the mandate refers that there should be 
concern for the extent of damage and local and global residual strength of ship 
structures, after accidental events. Therefore the contents of the report deal also with 
methods to determine local and global residual strength, including the specification of 
the appropriate loads. 
 
It starts by providing a description of the type of damages that can be found in the 
various accidental events. Representative scenarios are described and the typical 
damages that results from the specific accidents are indicated. Next section describes 
how in real situations the damaged state is perceived. Thus, inspection methods are 
described as well as the available approaches to derive information about the status of 
the structure from indirect measurements. 
 
Loads on the structure are treated afterwards, including the loads that are generated 
during the accidental situation itself and also after the accident when the ship is in 
damaged state, often listed and with non symmetric sections. The loads are used to 
determine ship strength using the assessment methods described in section 5, which 
deals with various types of components. 
 
If the ship is considered not having enough strength for temporary voyage to repair 
yard local repairs are necessary. Otherwise she will travel to a repair shipyard and be 
repaired there. The various types of problems raised in repair are dealt with in the 
following section. 
 
Finally last section deals with salvage and recovery strategies which are necessary in 
the cases of very large damage in ships. 
2. DESCRIPTION OF DAMAGES  
2.1 General description of damages 
According to Konopelko (1990), damages to the hull occur in 53% of ships’ accidents. 
On average, each ship of the world fleet suffers hull damage once in 10 years with two 
ships out of one hundred damaged ships being lost. More updated statistics on ship 
losses can be found in Guedes Soares and Teixeira (2001). 
 
A great variety of incidents exist, such as collisions, grounding, explosions and fires,

described by the function S = 0,144L – 2,72 m2, it will correspond to a value of 22 m2 
for L = 160 m but in some cases this value could be much greater. For example, the 
area of a hole of the dry-cargo ship “Moon Dok" (L = 160 m) generated in the collision 
with the tanker "Dubna" was equal to 135 m2; in another case the ore carrier 
"Smederevo" had a hole with an area of 250 m2. 
 
It is necessary to take into account that the holes are not the only damage of the hull as 
a result of grounding, collisions or explosions. According to Aleksandrov (1983) the 
ratio between the hole’s area and the whole area of damage is around 0.127 although in 
the calculations the value of 0.5 is proposed.  
 
The available statistics of hull damages confirms these conclusions. In reality the hole 
occupies a rather small space in comparison with the zone of damage - cracks, ruptures 
and deformations of plates and framing. It is necessary to note that the functioning of 
longitudinals in this zone changes substantially. These changes are caused by the loss 
of their cross-sectional area, reduction of the attached plates, tripping of stiffeners and 
large permanent deformations, change of the support of the main supporting members, 
and buckling. There is also the so-called "shadow" effect of the damaged area, i.e. as a 
result of the damage, a zone exists of physically intact longitudinals, which do not 
participate or only partly participate in hull girder bending in cases of large permanent 
deformations, destruction of the side structure reinforced transverses , transverse 
bulkheads leading to reduction of the hull girder strength.  
 
Thus, in general, according to the statistical data, the holes dimensions used in the 
standard calculations are close enough to their mean values, which allow for the 
recommendation of these dimensions for strength calculations of damaged ships at 
design stage. 
 
Based on the statistics for actual damage dimensions and the increase of still water 
loads resulting from the intake sea water, it is possible to unequivocally assert that it is 
necessary to consider essential reduction of the overall hull girder strength resulting 
from ship’s incidents, see Egorov (2007): 
 
1. Increase of the still water loads can occur in collisions with vessels and other 
objects; grounding, explosion; during salvage operations – anti heeling, 
unloading before removal from ground or during fire extinguishing. 
2. Increase of the still water loads can occur not only in collisions or other reasons 
(flooding of the supertanker "Marpessa", etc.), but also during removal from a 
grounding incident by unloading (10 % - 15 % from the initial displacement). 
3. Change of loading can occur by virtue of properties of the cargo in the flooded 
compartment – oil spill, dissolution of raw sugar, etc.

which is applied on the impacted structure and depends, among other factors, on the 
relative stiffness of the structures that collide. In particular, the description of the 
loading on a ship involved in a ship-ship collision includes the speed of the colliding 
ships, collision geometry. i.e. striking location, impact angle, relative orientation 
between striking and struck vessels, loading conditions - full load and ballast 
conditions are usually considered - draft, trim, bow shape, ship hull and striking bow 
structural arrangement, sea conditions, wind and current, and ship maintenance level. 
Human response may also affect the consequences, in particular the possibility of 
occurrence and the details of the scenario itself.  
 
The values of these parameters, which define the collision scenario, may be taken as 
those that would have the most unfavourable consequences, or those that have a pre-
defined level of occurrence. A more delicate approach could consider the probability 
density function of each parameter and finally calculate the risk of the colliding ship. In 
any case the hypothetical scenarios should represent situations that are as close as 
possible to those encountered in reality. Collision scenarios between ships and marine 
structures have been addressed in ISSC committee reports on Collision and Grounding 
of 2003 (Paik et al 2003, Paik 2006) and (Wang et al 2006). 
 
Samuelides et al (2008) investigated ship to ship collision scenarios that are included in 
existing rules and regulations or have been applied in the design process of a ship, and 
present data concerning the distributions of the kinetic energies of ships travelling 
worldwide and examples of use of these distributions for the prediction of the energies 
that are available to cause structural damage in particular collision cases. The authors 
further include quantitative examples of the “loading” according to rules and 
regulations or derived from the energy distributions, which is to be used in the design 
process of a ship.  
 
Design against collision has been an issue since the design of nuclear powered vessel 
“Savannah”. At that time it was decided to design her collision protection, in a way to 
withstand a collision with a T2 tanker at full load, i.e. a ship having a displacement of 
23000 tons, and a full design speed of 15 knots (Dodd and MacDonald, 1960). The 
decision took into account a survey of the world’s merchant fleet and the distribution of 
the maximum kinetic energy based on full load displacement and the design sea speed. 
The survey revealed that at that time the number of ships having a kinetic energy 
greater than 2.6×106 tons-knots2 (approximately 671MJ), which corresponds to the 
energy of the selected striking ship, falls off rapidly. The calculation of the damage of 
the target ship as well as the bow of the striking ship was performed using the formula 
of Minorsky (1959).  In order to use the pioneering formula, it was necessary to use as 
input parameter the entrance angle of the striking bow, which was taken equal to 57.2 
deg., and the vertical relevant position of the two ships. The latter was selected so as to 
result in the most unfavourable situation. The analysis showed that the nuclear vessel 
could withstand the collision with the T2 tanker travelling with 15 knots without 
damage of the reactor compartment. The volume of the damaged material outside the 
this space was calculated equal to 2,89 m2·cm for the target and 2,46 m2·cm for the

2.2.2 Classification guidelines for design against collision 
Germanischer Lloyd (2004) was the first Classification Society to the authors’ 
knowledge, which introduced non-compulsory rules concerning strengthening against 
collisions. In accordance with those, a notation COLL followed by a number 1 to 6, is 
added to the class of the ship, reflecting her behaviour when involved in a collision, 
relative to the behaviour to a single hull ship that has no particular design to resist 
collision with ice or other object. The determination of the notation is based on two 
quantities. One is the critical speed of the striking vessel. The other is the ratio of the 
“critical energy”, i.e. the structural energy absorbed by the structure of the ship under 
consideration before occurrence of unacceptable damage to her hull, to the critical 
energy absorbed by the un-strengthened ship. COLL3 indicates, for example, that the 
structure of the double hull tanker under consideration may absorb 4 to 6 times more 
energy before rupture of the skin of her tank rather than a single hull tanker, and 
additionally the critical speed of the striking vessel is at least 2.5 knots. The respective 
values for COLL2 are 3 to 4 and 1.5 knots.  
 
In order to evaluate these quantities the ship in question is tested in eight collision cases, 
all with a ship of roughly the same displacement, but with various draught 
combinations of the striking and struck vessels. The bow of the striking ship is assumed 
to have a bulb in four cases and no bulb in the rest. If these provisions are applied for 
the collision analysis of a 275 m long Suezmax tanker having a maximum draught of 
17 m and a ballast draught of 9 m, then the difference of the draughts between the 
striking and the struck vessels will be ±2 m and ±6 m. Zhang et al (2004) used the 
scenarios prescribed in the regulations and a FE code to investigate the collision 
behaviour of an ice-strengthened 90 m long multi purpose cargo ship, and found that 
after investigation of the prescribed collision cases, 8 in total, the average energy 
absorption capacity for her ice strengthened side shell before penetration of the inner 
hull is 21 MJ, which corresponds to a central and right angle collision with a ship of 
same size travelling with a speed of 7 knots.     
 
More recently Egge et al (2007) reported a combination of a method to assess the 
collision behaviour on one hand and the SOLAS requirements for probabilistic damage 
stability of the other. According to the analysis the strengthening of the side shell to 
withstand collision could increase the attained subdivision index. Consequently, it

380 m3 size of tanks. In March 2008, the river Rhine authority, has adopted this 
approach and defined a method to determine the risk associated with accidental outflow 
of dangerous cargo from chemical tankers or gas tankers (United Nations 2008). Based 
on the assessment a designer may divert from the prescriptive regulations related to the 
maximum capacity of a cargo tank or the minimum required distance between the side 
shell and the cargo bulkhead provided that the tank vessel has a crashworthy side 
structure. The effectiveness of the crashworthy side structure must be demonstrated by 
comparing the risk of a conventional construction (reference construction), complying 
with the regulations, with the risk of a crashworthy construction (alternative 
construction). It is interesting to note that the method specifies cumulative probability 
density functions for collision energy with which the struck ship will have to cope in a 
collision. It is also interesting to note that grounding is not seen as a cargo spill scenario. 
The method is based on the concept of equivalence and it does not give any absolute 
risk values.

concerning ship-ship collisions that have been presented above.

Three - KAISA 520, ADNR and DNV - out of the four codes that have been presented 
concern particular ship types – ships for transportation of irradiated fuel, chemical and 
CNG carriers - that present severe hazards in case they are involved in a collision. The 
GL rules are in principle applicable to all type of ships. However the latter do not 
prescribe any mandatory requirement, but provide a tool to compare a ship that is 
strengthened against collision actions with an unstrengthened ship. 
 
One crucial element of the scenarios is the level of the prescribed energy. KAISA 520, 
ADNR and DNV prescribe rather modest energy levels that the target vessel should be 
able to absorb, i.e. energies that are between 10 MJ and 258MJ.

ADNR refers to in-land shipping, whereby the ships usually travel with low speeds. It 
is worthwhile to note that the code was employed in order to prove that a ship with a 
more efficient compartmentation than the existing vessels has the same collision related 
risk, if a innovative structural design of a double hull side shell is used.  
 
As far as GL Rules are concerned, according to the examples given in Bockenhauer 
and Egge (1995) the notation COLL2 to COLL4 is given to vessels, which have 
adequate energy capacity, when they collide with ships having similar size travelling 
with speed varying from 2.7 knots to 4 knots. 
 
In general, the level of energies that are discussed above, are inferior to energies that 
are encountered in the open sea. For example a ship of 50000 t displacement, travelling 
with 16 knots, has an initial kinetic energy of 1693 MJ, which is considerably higher 
than the level of energies considered by the Rules. If such a vessel strikes a ship of 
approximately equal size a large amount of energy, will be released to cause structural 
damage. Investigation of the world fleet and of collision accidents that occurred in the 
past showed that such “high” energy collisions do happen and there are indications that 
more than 50% of the initial collision energy is available to cause structural damage. 
Consequently a design procedure for collision protection should, in principle, take them 
into account. Furthermore, the investigation of the distributions of the parameters that 
influence the ship-ship collisions, show that a probabilistic risk-based assessment of the 
collision behaviour of ships, should include the influence of the collision angle and the 
friction coefficient between the two ships.   
 
2.2.3 Choice of Collision Scenario 
Various scenarios have been proposed for the assessment of the collision behaviour of 
ships involved in ship-ship collisions. Scenarios in existing codes and scenarios that 
have been incorporated in the design process may be classified in three categories: 
 
ISSC Committee V.1: Damage Assessment After Accidental Events 21  
 
 
maintained by the Finish Board of Navigation, over half of all impact incidents were 
groundings and 48% occurred near islands or in narrow waters. 
 
In order to quantify the probability of grounding occurrence and to investigate the 
effect of various factors on the likelihood and consequences of grounding, Samuelides 
et al (2007b) developed a database of accidents and populated it with data of accidents 
on Greek ships over 100 GT. The data were retrieved from the records of the 
Directorate of the Safety of Navigation of the Hellenic Ministry of Mercantile Marine 
(HMMM), which should cover all accidents of ships sailing under the Greek flag with 
size over 100GT, from 1992 to 2005. The investigations of accidents of ships over 100 
GT, with Greek flag, from 1992 to 2005 revealed that groundings were the most 
frequent accidents: 47% of the total number of the reported accidents were groundings 
or caused grounding of a ship. However, only a few of those had catastrophic 
consequences. Further investigation of the accidents also revealed that: 
 
9 The decrease with time of the total number of accidents is proven to be statistically 
significant whereas the trend for groundings cannot be given as statistically 
significant; 
9 The dry cargo vessels suffer the most from groundings, 58% of the groundings 
involved dry cargo vessels, even though the ship-years of cargo vessels in the 
Greek fleet is 33%. 
9 Aged ships, i.e. ships in the between 21-30 years old and 30+ years old, suffer the 
most from groundings even though the ship-years of the ships in these age 
categories is relatively low. 
9 The ratio of groundings over the total number of accidents is higher for large 
rather than for smaller ships. From the investigation of the data it was found in 
every ten accidents for ships between 100 GT and 1000 GT there were 4,2 
accidents with grounding and 5,8 accidents with other types of accidents, while for 
every 10 marine accidents for ships larger than 30000 GT, there were 6,7 
accidents with grounding and 3,3 accidents with other type of accidents, and this 
differentiation was found to be statistically significant. 
9 There is a statistical difference between the mean values of the size (in GT) of the 
tankers that after grounding produced pollution and of those that did not lead to oil 
spillage; whereby larger ships tend to pollute more rather than smaller.  
 
Table 6 presents the grounding return period on the basis of the accidents that occurred 
from 2001 to 2005 and from 1995 to 2005.

for the four structures; moreover, the energy absorption at this point of puncture of the 
inner bottom was quite high for structures II and IV, whereas the weights of those 
structures are not much higher than for the conventional structure. Structure IV, for 
example, is 4% heavier than the conventional structure (structure I) but the average 
energy absorption at the point of tank top fracture is 33% larger than for the 
conventional structure. Sandwich panels are locally weak due to the small thickness, 
when a sharp local contact takes place. On the contrary, for a wider shape of contact the 
double bottom construction will be stronger than conventional stiffened plate bottom. 
 
The effect of different indenter size has been investigated by Wang et al (2000). This 
was done through a series of scaled down double bottom grounding experiments. The 
study clearly shows that small indenters puncture the hull skin with relative ease, while 
larger indenters damage the internal web configuration before the shell plating ruptures.  
 
In order to better understand the interaction between the ship hull and the sea bed 
during grounding, Alsos & Amdahl (2007) investigated the influence of size and shape 
of sea floor during grounding. Three indenter topologies with four different locations, 
shown in Figure 3 were examined: (1) “Rock”: Indenters are much smaller than the 
ship itself, with a paraboloid bottom diameter of 0.2 ship beam; (2) “Shoal”: The 
“shoal” dimension is about half the ship hull width; (3) “Reef”: An intermediate 
indenter.

Figure 3: Three indenter topologies and position (from Alsos and Amdahl 2007) 
 
The traditional rock indenter punctures the skin easily with local structural damage. 
Large ‘‘shoals’’ indenters, on the other hand, may deform large parts of the hull 
structure. The web crushing and grillage deformation of the double bottom web may 
occur. Even though, the outer hull may not fracture, the overall damage may be severe. 
Stranded ships subjected to tidal changes and the loss in water level, as the ship is 
displaced out of the water, will yield a re-distribution of hydrostatic forces due to 
grounding actions. The interaction between the grounding contact force and the 
hogging bending moment affects both the longitudinal and penetration resistance of the 
hull. During the process, fracture may not take place, however, the buckling of the

2.4 Damage due to fire, blast and underwater explosions 
Composite materials are increasingly used for marine structures. The application of 
composite materials on commercial passenger is controlled by a strict fire safe safety 
requirement stipulated by International Marine Organization (IMO 1994 & 1998). 
When the composite plates are exposed to fire, ignition will occur after about 30 
seconds, the polyester matrix will be charred, and the plate will be delaminated and 
cracked. Following ignition, combustion of epoxy resin causes a large reduction in the 
mechanical properties. The residual shear strength and stiffness correlates with the 
thickness of burnt region, and the residual tensile strength correlates with the mass loss 
of the laminate.  
 
Gardiner at el (2004) investigated the flexural and compressive properties of glass 
reinforced polyester (GRP) plate after exposure to kerosene fuel tray fire for time up to 
10m. The residual flexural and compressive properties were measured at room 
temperature, and were found to decrease rapidly with increasing exposure time. 
 
The risk of fire and of fire-related structural degradation and failure are the challenge to 
the safe design and accurate structural assessment of composite ship structures. Lua et 
al (2006) developed a temperature and mass dependent heat diffusion model to 
characterize the temperature and mass dependent heat conduction, energy consumption 
resulting from the decomposition, and the energy transfer associated with vaporous 
migration. The temperature dependent thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity 
are determined for the composite at a given resin decomposition stage using a recently 
developed small-scale test apparatus. The effects of temperature dependent thermal 
conductivity, specific heat capacity, and kinetic parameters determined at different 
heating rates are explored through the application of the temperature and mass 
dependent fire model to a composite plate subjected to a hydrocarbon fire. The thermal 
gradient due to fire induces a gradient of structural properties, reduces the overall 
stiffness, e.g. degradation, and thus reduces the load carrying capacity.  Gu and Asaro 
(2005) proposed an analytical expression for the buckling load obtained from the 
theory of functionally graded materials. The solutions are given in a relatively simple 
form, which can be used to guide design practice, to verify large finite element 
calculations, as well as to provide insights in fire testing. 
 
Teixeira and Guedes Soares (2006c) have presented a reliability formulation that 
accounted for the compressive loads induced by local thermal loading of plates, as 
induced by a fire. The collapse strength of the plates were determines by a finite 
element code that too into account the changes in material properties as the temperature 
was spreading in the plate. 
 
The sudden energy release associated with the explosion of a high explosive leads to 
the formation of a superheated, highly compressed gas bubble and the generation of a 
shock wave in the surrounding medium. If the explosion occurs in water, it will be 
followed by a gas bubble pulsation. When the ship is attacked by air blast or

shock resistance. Surface ship shock experiments have been conducted in many 
countries for shock qualification of ship integrity, systems and subsystems. However, 
conducting shock experiments to determine how submerged structures dynamically 
respond to and are damaged by UNDEX are extremely expensive and time consuming. 
On the other hand the advanced numerical modeling and simulation is a possible 
alternative to provide usable information to examine the details of dynamic 
characteristics of ship including component and sub-component level. 
 
Park et al (2003) described the measurements of naval ship responses to UNDEX 
shock loadings, which had conducted for a coastal mine hunter (MHC) and a mine 
sweeper/ hunter (MSH). Shin (2004) conducted a ship shock analysis using finite 
element based coupled ship and fluid model. Three-dimensional ship shock modeling 
and simulation has been performed and the predicted results were compared with ship 
shock test data. Liang & Tai (2006) investigated the transient responses of a 2000-ton 
patrol-boat subjected to an underwater explosion with keel shock factor 0.8. The shock 
loading history along keel, the acceleration, velocity and displacement time histories 
are presented. Furthermore, the study elucidates the plastic zone spread phenomena and 
deformed diagram of the ship.  
 
Librescu et al (2007) examined the problem of the dynamic response of sandwich flat 
panels subjected to explosive blast loadings produced by both underwater and in-air 
explosions, which were carried out in the context of a geometrically nonlinear model of 
sandwich structures featuring anisotropic laminated face sheets and a transversely 
compressible orthotropic core. The unsteady pressure generated by the explosion and 
acting on the face of the sandwich panel includes the effect of the pressure wave 
transmission through the core. 
 
In order to improve the survivability of warship to UNDEX, Tong at el (2007) 
proposed a type of rubber shock absorption and isolation structure. The structure uses 
the principle of energy absorption with structure deformation and shock wave 
reflection between the interfaces of materials with great impedance mismatch. The 
shock protective layer (SPL) can be stuck to the outer hull of the ship. 
 
Louca & Mohamed (2008) investigated the behavior of a typical offshore topside 
structure subjected to blast loading caused by hydrocarbon explosions. Recent 
developments in the Brazilian oil industry led to the necessity to conduct offshore 
platforms UNDEX survivability studies. The ongoing research has been segmented in 
parts, including theoretical and experimental correlated studies. Part of this study 
involves computer simulation, and, therefore, the necessary validation of the developed 
models used in such simulations. Motta et al (2007) presented a benchmark problem 
for experimental implementation of a submerged aluminum cylinder submitted to the 
UNDEX effects.  
 
 
 
ISSC Committee V.1: Damage Assessment After Accidental Events 29  
 
 
and acoustic emission methods to the characterization and integrity assessment as well 
as strain rate and nano-phasing behaviors of composite marine structures. 
 
The measurement Acoustic emission techniques which were first developed in the 50s 
are widely used in failure detection of structure parts. A recent example of the 
application of this technology to ship structures can be found in Wang et al (2008).   
 
An Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation method for rapidly inspecting large area 
composite structures has been developed by the US Navy. This method, called 
Structural Irregularity and Damage Evaluation Routine (SIDER), was used to rapidly 
interrogate the entire hull structure to identify the areas that had experienced structural 
degradation that manifested itself in a structural stiffness change. Crane and Ratcliffe 
(2007) presented the results of the SIDER inspection of a 1/2-scale GRP corvette hull 
mid-ship section before and after each of three underwater explosion (UNDEX) 
loadings and compares the findings with conventional ultrasonic inspection. 
 
Signal analysis technique, e.g. time-frequency analysis or wavelet transform 
technology were applied to recognize the characteristics of elastic wave of structures 
for predication of the damage conditions and the location of damage were. Yang et al 
(2008) applied a discrete wavelet transform technology to detect the cracks on the 
beam and the plate, respectively. The double-cracked beam and a plate with multiple 
cracks are evaluated by one-dimensional and two-dimensional discrete wavelet 
transforms.  
 
Several damaged identification method based on vibration measurement were proposed 
in past years, these  methods are based on the acquisition and comparison of the 
dynamical properties of structure before and after damage of structures, which are the  
Frequency Response Functions (FRFs), the natural frequency, damping ratio and modal 
shapes.  
 
Bovio and Lecce (2006) developed a structural damage identification method based on 
vibration measurement. The method was based on the acquisition and comparison of 
Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the monitored structure before and after an 
occurred damage. A “damage index” for identifying damage on composite structures 
was proposed. 
 
Budipriyanto et al (2007) described a scheme based on the dynamical characteristics of 
structures for identifying damage on a cross stiffened plate of a tanker ship model. The 
amplitude of a function containing the natural frequency, the damping ratio and the 
response was used as an indicator for damage. The function was obtained from a 
simulation using a neural network technique which inputs were the model's response. 
 
Xiang et al (2008) presented a damage detection method by using only partial 
measurement of vibration in a suspect region, which can not only locate damaged 
members but also evaluate damage severities. The first three modes identified by a

failure mechanisms. 
 
Paik and Seo (2007a,b) presented an efficient method for the progressive structural 
crashworthiness analysis of ship and ship-shaped offshore structures under collision or 
grounding with small computation efforts.  
 
Yamada and Pedersen (2008) reviewed the simplified formulas for estimating the axial 
crushing forces of plated structures. The approximate method based on intersection unit 
elements such as L-, T- and X-type elements and based on plate unit elements were 
employed in the analyses. The crushing forces and the total absorbed energy for four 
different designs of large-scale bulbous bow models, shown in Figure 4 were calculated 
by existing simplified analyses. The experimental results were compared with the 
results obtained by following approximate methods: Amdahl (1983), Yang & Caldwell 
(1988), Abramowicz (1994), Wang & Ohtsubo (1999), Paik & Pedersen (1995), Zhang 
(1999) and Endo & Yamada (2001).

Hong and Amdahl (2008) proposed a new theoretical model for the crushing of web 
girder under localized in-plane load on the basis of a comparative study of existing 
simplified methods. The model captured several features of local crushing process of 
girder which were not accounted by the existing simplified methods. If strain rate effect 
took into consideration, the calculated crushing force gave some better results than that 
of the original static formulas. The effect of stiffeners on the crushing resistance of web 
should not be neglected, when the stiffener is involved in the formation of the first fold.

grounding and/or after the ship is set aground.  
d) Loading patterns that are defined prior to the incident and remain constant during 
the grounding.  
 
Methods for simulation of groundings that employ such scenarios usually define the 
orientation of the grounding forces either directly or indirectly by defining the relative 
path of the sea bed with respect to the bottom of the ship. The result of the simulations 
is either the function of the grounding force vs. the longitudinal damage or the 
grounding force vs. the transverse penetration – this particular case of grounding is 
referred to as stranding. The analysis may be static or dynamic and may be performed 
with analytical techniques that in most cases result in closed-form equations - or 
numerical techniques. Analytical techniques are developed for the determination of the 
collapse load of the structure that suffer the impact and/or the cutting load that is 
induced in the ship’s plating as the sea bed advances through it, and are based on 
several assumptions, whereby the more usual are: a) the loading pattern remains 
unaffected by the grounding actions, b) the collapse mode is defined a priori, c) the 
material has a rigid plastic behavior, and d) inertia effects are considered negligible. 
Strain-rate effects on yield stress may be taken into account by adjusting the yield of 
the material using the well known Cowper-Symonds equation. Recent work on 
analytical methods for the prediction of grounding behavior is that of Hong et al (2008, 
2007).  
 
In FE simulations the loading scenario includes the a priori definition of the motion of 
the sea-bed with respect to the bottom structure. The simulations are mostly performed 
using commercial explicit codes, LS-DYNA, ABAQUS, which may include the inertia 
effects and various material models. Recent finite element simulations of groundings 
have been reported by Zhang et al (2006), Samuelides et al (2007a), Alsos et al (2007). 
Paik and Seo (2007 a,b) propose to perform collision and grounding simulations using 
a method which that is based on the discretization of the structure using large elements 
and referred to as the “idealized structural unit method” - ISUM. 
 
Loading patterns that take into account the 6 dof motion of the ship with respect to the 
sea-bed  
 
Grounding actions may affect the motion of the ship and consequently the orientation 
of the load with respect to the hull.  Analytical simulation techniques that take into 
account the motion due to grounding loads and update during the incident the loading 
patterns are included in computed program DAMAGE that is based on the work of 
Simonsen (1997). The program includes two modes of computations: an uncoupled 
mode and a coupled mode, i.e. a mode that takes into account the effect of ship motions. 
However it was found that the sway and yaw motions do not affect the results 
(Simonsen et al, 1996) and they are therefore neglected.  
 
Explicit finite element codes may account for the motion of the ship either as rigid-
body or as flexible beam finite element simulations that include the effect of the ship

analysis.   
 
Alsos et al (2007) computed the response of the hull of a ship that rests on the sea bed 
using the explicit code LS-DYNA. The loading scenario has been described by the 
pressure loads that are applied to the hull as a result of her contact with the sea bed on 
one hand and the global vertical bending moments on the other. The pressure acting 
between the sea bed and the hull influences both the penetration of the sea bed in the 
hull and the vertical bending moments. The vertical bending results in compression of 
the bottom panels and consequently has an effect on their stiffness as the sea bed 
penetrates the hull. In this manner the loading from the sea bed is coupled with the 
vertical bending moments on the hull. Further the authors have investigated the effect 
of the motion of the aft and fore segments of the hull once a hinge is formed between 
the two segments. 
 
4.1.2 Observations from actual grounding cases  
Samuelides et al (2007a) reported on the loading patterns that are applied to the bottom 
structure of a ship that grounds and the subsequent structural response/failure 
mechanisms. The investigation was based on the review of six rather well documented 
groundings, those of    
 
9 a 273,000 dwt VLCC, 
9 LNG El Paso Paul Kayser, with a capacity of 130,000 m3,  
9 the 131,000 dwt single skin tanker Sea Emperess, 
9 naval vessel Valvidia,  
9 New Carissa, a 195 m double bottom bulk carrier, and 
9 a passenger vessel with 2,200 people on board. 
 
The grounding energies of the cases above varied from approximately 190 MJ to 5,200 
MJ.  
 
From the description of the above mentioned grounding incidents, the following 
conclusions regarding the loading of the bottom structure were drawn: 
 
a) the bottom structure is subjected to a number of loading patterns, which 
depend, on the topology and type of sea bed and the impact geometry; 
b) the loading due to grounding, is not limited in time only in the initial phase of 
a grounding incident, i.e. when the kinetic energy of the ship prior to 
grounding is dissipated in structural energy, but may damage the ship’s 
structure days after the incident; 
c) structural components that are damaged during the initial incident, may 
subsequently be subject to serious loading conditions, which may cause 
further damage; 
d) A vessel that grounds may suffer serious damage and nevertheless continue 
her course, even when she has relatively low energy prior to impact. 
ISSC Committee V.1: Damage Assessment After Accidental Events 37  
 
 
grounding behavior of a ship should be able to predict the response of the ship structure 
for days after the initial incident and under unfavorable weather conditions.  
 
4.2 Loads in damaged ships 
The distinctive aspect of loads in damaged ships is related to the damage itself. 
Damages may involve the ingress of water with the consequences of changing the ship 
displacement and even its atitute. This later aspect may also have influence on the wave 
loads, which start then being induced in a non-symmetric floating body and the strength 
criteria will also be applied on the global bending of the hull on an inclined hull. 
 
Methods are available to predict the effects of progressive flooding of ships in ship 
stability and survivability. The process of water ingress is often modelled using a 
hydraulic coefficient that governs the volume and speed of water ingress. 
 
Works on global loads for damaged ships are relatively rare. In fact, the structural 
strength of damaged ships in waves is only now being considered in detail in the design 
process. The studies on global loads in damaged ships are generally carried out in the 
frequency domain for several damage conditions which result in different trim and heel 
angles. Folso and Iaccarino (2005) present the results of a numerical study of this kind 
for a damaged tanker. 
  
Korkut et al. (2005) present the results of an experimental study on the global loads 
acting on a damaged Ro-Ro model in head, stern and beam regular waves of different 
frequencies and heights. These authors conclude that the damage frequently has an 
adverse and non-linear effect on the structural loading and that the behavior of the 
pressure values on the bulkheads which limit the damage is rather complex.  
 
These studies consider only the behavior of the ships in the final damage condition, 
disregarding entirely the intermediate stages of flooding. The study of the entire 
flooding process can only be undertaken using time domain models capable of 
calculating the progression of the flooding. Santos and Guedes Soares (2002) present 
one such model which combines sufficient accuracy with moderate computational time, 
making it suitable even for use within Monte-Carlo simulation approaches such as that 
described by Santos and Guedes Soares (2005b). This approach has also the advantage 
of taking into account the statistics concerning damage location and extension given in 
Lutzen and Rusaas (2001), allowing a more comprehensive analysis than before.  
 
Having obtained the entire time histories of the global loads throughout the flooding 
process, the maximum values can then be used to verify the ultimate longitudinal 
strength of the damaged ship using the methods described by Gordo and Guedes Soares 
(2000) or Ziha and Pedisic (2002).  
 
The amount of water that will flood the ship depends on the location and extend of the 
damage but also on the basic features of the ship in terms of subdivision. Therefore it is 
ISSC Committee V.1: Damage Assessment After Accidental Events 39  
 
 
to failure was far more significantly reduced by general corrosion than was tensile 
stress. 
 
Nakai et al (2005a, b) conducted a series of tensile tests using specimens with 
randomly distributed pits to investigate their effect on tensile strength. The tensile 
strength is little affected by the pitting pattern and total elongation is influenced by 
pitting pattern. It has been revealed that the tensile strength of randomly pitted steel 
plates could be predicted the proposed formula using Dmax(diameter of largest pit) and 
DOP area ratio of pitting corrosion. 
 
Yu et al. (2008) examined the effects of corrosion on the ductile fracture of steel 
plating. They developed two theoretical models for predicting rupture strain for power 
law plastic material with corrosion pit imperfection, a 1D model based on a single 
localization zone and a 3D model based on FEA. Both models indicate a strong 
reduction in fracture elongation in the presence of imperfections caused by corrosion 
pits. 
 
Nakai et al (2006a,b) performed a series of non-linear FE analysis for pitted rectangular 
plate under compressive and shear loading condition, and revealed that ultimate 
compressive and shear strength of pitted plate is smaller than that of uniformly 
corroded plate in terms of average thickness loss and that prediction results of ultimate 
strength using average thickness loss at minimum cross section would be on the safe 
side. They also showed that the tensile strength under corrosion is proposed based on 
the test results and the tensile strength reduction due to pitting corrosion is expressed as 
a function of DOP area ratio of pitting corrosion, pit diameter, and original thickness of 
plate. Furthermore, the tensile strength is little affected by the pitting pattern, and the 
total elongation is influenced by the pitting pattern even if the degree of pitting (DOP) 
is the same. Nakai et al (2006a,b) revealed that the ultimate strength for hold flames 
could be well predicted by the empirical formula, which was developed in the previous 
study to estimate the ultimate strength of steel plates under compression and shear. 
 
Ok et al (2007) focused on assessing the effects of localized pitting corrosion which 
concentrates at one or several possibly large area on the ultimate strength of plates. 
Over 256 nonlinear FEA of panels with various locations and size of pitting corrosion 
have been carried out. To represent the real structure with a pitted area, ANSYS shell 
layer model was adopted and the mid-plane nodes in pitted area were artificially moved. 
They clarified that the depth and width of corrosion were the two dominant parameters 
on the reduction of ultimate strength of plates while plate slenderness has only marginal 
effect on strength reduction. When corrosion spreads transversely on both edges, it has 
the most deteriorating effect on strength. 
 
Jian and Guedes Soares (2008) have studied the strength of rectangular plates with 
corrosion pits modelled by through thickness holes, while Saad-Eldeen and Guedes 
Soares (2009) considered cases in which the depth of the pit was smaller than the plate 
thickness. 
ISSC Committee V.1: Damage Assessment After Accidental Events 41  
 
 
Luis et al (2007a,b, 2008) have studied the strength of panels of 3 plates joined 
transversely and longitudinally and compared their collapse strength with the one from 
a single damaged plate, showing the effect that the interaction with adjacent plates has. 
Luis and Guedes Soares (2007) studied the collapse strength of a panel of 3 plates 
joined transversally and 3 plates longitudinally. The damage-induced imperfection was 
located only one of the nine plates of the panel. It has been found the effect of local 
imperfection depends on the slenderness: increases from negligible for stock panels, to 
significant for very slender ones. They concluded that a local imperfection interacts 
with the global one and the effect of the position of local dent depends on the overall 
shape of initial imperfections. 
 
Witkowska and Guedes Soares (2008) investigated the strength of stiffened panes with 
local dents whose magnitude is twt ×= 250.0 β . They concluded that the stiffened panels 
after being damaged in a form of local dent demonstrate quite good performance. They 
are not affected much by the damage, the reduction rate of ultimate strength barely 
reached 1-2% for majority of cases and only for most slender ones it got to around 5 % 
level. 
 
Paik and Kumar (2006) studied the ultimate strength reduction characteristics of a 
stiffened panel with cracking damage under axial tension and compression.  A series of 
nonlinear finite element analyses were undertaken with varying the size and location of 
cracking damage by using LS-DYNA introducing ductile fracture of material.  A 
relevant theoretical model for predicting the ultimate strength of the stiffened panel 
with cracking damage were studied and simple formula of predicting ultimate strength 
of cracked stiffened panel was presented. 
 
Nikolov (2008) examined the ultimate strength of damaged continuous plating based 
on FEA. He concluded that the compressive strength of damaged plating is 
significantly influenced by the residual stress and pointed up that the simplified 
methods in CSR for Bulk Carriers may overestimate the ultimate strength for slender 
damaged plating. 
 
Witkowska and Guedes Soares (2009) have examined the collapse strength of stiffened 
plates in which the stiffener is damaged. In this initial study a single stiffened plate was 
examined and the influence of different levels of imperfection was quantified. 
 
5.2.2 Residual strength of damaged girder  
Rim et al. (2008) conducted the a series of collapse test using box-girder model of 
720mm×720mm in section and 900mm in length to investigate the effect of stranding 
damage size on the ultimate strength of ship structures. From the experimental results, 
they found that the ultimate strength is reduced as the damage size increased, and the 
ultimate strength is reduced by about 20% than that of no damaged one when the 
damaged size is 30% of the breadth of the specimen.

Ozgur, et al. (2005) and Das and Fang (2007) investigated the residual strength of 
single side skin(SSS) and double side skin (DSS) bulk carriers subject to collision 
damage. Wide range analyses were carried out in both hogging and sagging cases with 
considering of the intact and damaged scenarios and also considered corrosion effect 
based on JBP rules. Furthermore the failure probability of damaged DSS and SSS bulk 
carriers was studied assuming the load effects obtained from the classification rules and 
American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) guideline, respectively. The simplified method 
based on an incremental-iterative approach like smith method was employed using a 
developed computer code NEPTUNE. In order to include damage by collision, all 
elements failed have been removed from the intact original configuration. They showed 
that the DSS bulk carriers have higher safety index than the SSS bulk carriers in 
hogging and in sagging conditions under similar collision damage scenarios, and this 
index value is greater in hogging case compared to that in the sagging case. Damages 
in upper side shell and in deck structure lead to reduce the residual strength 
significantly when subject to in-plane compressive load combinations. 
 
Luis et al. (2007) investigated the residual longitudinal strength of double Suezmax 
tankers after groundings or collision. The calculations were performed using a 
computer code based on the Smith method. The damage was simulated by removing 
the damaged elements from the midship section. Luis et al (2006) presented a

ship hull corroded according to CSR and actual state with measure thickness of 
structural elements after 25 years of service. And they revealed that the hull-girder 
reliability of the actual ship hull, with measured thickness after 25 years of service, is 
still higher than the reliability calculated for the hull with corrosion deduction thickness 
according to CSR. 
 
Fujii, Kawabe and Yao (2007) investigated a series of progressive collapse analysis 
applying the Smith’s method for evaluation of ultimate hull girder strength and its 
sensitivities with respect to design parameters and suggested that the ultimate hull 
girder strength might be sensitive to the progress of corrosion from the numerical 
results. 
6. EMERGENCY REPAIRS AND MITIGATION ACTIONS 
6.1 Recovery strategies  
One of the main reasons for damage and strength assessment of ships and offshore 
structures, after an accidental event, is, in addition to assess the remaining safety level, 
to provide the background for any rescue, salvage and or recovery strategy. These 
strategies vary significantly depending on the status of the structure, its future and its 
value.  
 
6.1.1 Emergency 
Emergency could be defined to exist, when ship, her crew and cargo are in peril and 
could be lost following loss of stability, collision, grounding, water ingress, structural 
collapse, fire, explosion, shifting of cargo, loss of engine power, etc. In any of these 
events or similar, quick assessment is urgently necessary to evaluate the condition of 
the vessel in order to predict the short and long term perspectives. For oil rigs, floating 
and storage units and other floating structures of non-conventional ship shape, the 
emergency can be defined in a similar way as above.  
 
The initial assessment is always performed by the onboard crew and relevant actions 
are taken. When the situation is critical and is rapidly deteriorating, often the decision 
is to abandon the ship and leave it on her own. In such cases rescue operations are 
initiated to save the crew.  
 
When there is a confidence about the short term perspective, the onboard crew may 
initiate evaluation of the vessel’s condition by themselves or request assistance from 
ashore. As from 01.01.2007 MARPOL convention in Annex I, Ch.5, Reg.37(4) 
requires all tankers for oil of 5000 dwt and upwards to have access to shore based 
computerized programs for the assessment of the damage stability and residual strength 
in emergency. There is number of software developments and services, providing such 
assistance.  With access to such programs quick assessment is achieved and relevant

removal, use of the tide sea level differences, wave contribution, beach gears, tugs, 
scouring, buoyancy material, jaking, cranes and launching cradles. For each technique 
a brief description is reported along with the recent improvements.

State of the art of dry salvage technique in the offshore filed has been presented by 
Enderlin, Reynolds and Hendershot (2001). In their publication is presented the 
innovative salvage method adopted to remove the main pass structure of the Shallow 
Water Protector Platform #3 located offshore Lousinana and damaged by the Hurrican 
Georges. After performing an HAZID study it was decided to reduce the reinforced 
concrete deck into modules that were manageable by the lifeboat’s crane by Ultra-High 
pressure Water Jet cutting. In the paper is highlighted how the use of the innovative 
technique not only removes commercial divers from a hazardous underwater 
environment of cutting operations but also from any hazard caused by shifting concrete 
deck sections as they were segmented into manageable pieces. 
 
Wet salvage is performed when the ship or floating structure have capsized or sunk. 
For this type of salvage can be reported, as an example of the state of the art, the case 
of the Dynamic Positioned Flexible Fallpipe Vessel ‘Rocknes’. The vessel, 166 meters 
long, capsized in few minutes near Bergen after hitting a shallow. The vessel had to be 
turned in upright condition and the company SMIT salvage BV performed the 
operations. As can be seen from Figure 15, first the vessel was secured at her starboard 
side by means of hold back wires connected to 12 rock anchors each drilled 12 meters 
down into the rock structure. On the portside the vessel was connected to two pull-
barges trough cables connected to her bottom structures passing under the ‘Rocknes’ 
surface. Then the winches mounted on the barges pulled into the portside directions 
forcing the vessel into a rotating movement and finally turning the vessel into an

and locations of keel blocks at dry-docking. It is anticipated that the dry docking will 
be carried out with empty cargo holds and/or –tanks. USA Coast Guard, MLCA Naval 
Engineering Division has published a useful guideline/instruction with check lists, 
intended for dry-docking of USCG ships (USCG 2004).  
 
In conjunction with damage to a ship’s hull structure, rudder or propulsion machinery it 
may be necessary to dry dock the ship immediately in order to prevent further damage.  
Should it take too long time to off-load the cargo as well as to empty the bunker- and 
storage oil tanks it is an emergency dry-docking operation.  The ship’s original dry 
docking plan not is valid for the ship’s actual load condition.  
 
Emergency dry-docking operations of full loaded ships have successfully been carried 
out (P. Lindstrom private communication). The keel blocks plans have been prepared 
and/or scrutinized by the use of following empirical keel block calculation rule: 
 
- Minimum keel block area to be used: 1 m2 
- 50 % of the total keel block area shall be located under the ship’s keel 
(longitudinal centre line) 
- Maximum surface pressure on each keel block: 
- Swedish-Finnish Ice Class 1A 240 ton/m2 
- Single hull tanker 160 ton/m2 
 
6.2 Emergency Repairs and upgrade status 
Emergency repair of ship and offshore structures is considered to be the fundamental 
knowledge by experienced merchant mariners. “Emergency repair” is here defined as 
the techniques used to prevent leakage and/or maintain the integrity of the hull, 
compartments, pipe systems etc. (M. Persson private communication). This knowledge 
is by tradition transferred from man to man when it is applied. It is also transferred 
between the mariners when they are sharing their experiences.  For the time being are 
these techniques and/or concepts not a part of the formal education of seamen or 
Merchant Marine Officers. techniques and/or concepts not a part of the formal 
education of seamen or Merchant Marine Officers  (G. Lindblad private 
communication). 
 
For sailors and officers serving in a nation’s Navy is the maintaining of ship’s integrity 
a fundamental part of the training. A curriculum and/or training material has not been 
found in a public library data base. As a result there of, is this knowledge considered as 
restricted. Nevertheless, based on professional knowledge and experiences is it known 
that the fundamentals of “emergency repair” are based on following concepts in various 
combinations: 
 
- Plugging (wood, rubber, nylon, lead, brass, steal) 
- Patching (a plate with sealing substance pressed to the  leak) 
- Concrete boxes (capturing the damage) 
- Composites (expanding foams, glues,) 
ISSC Committee V.1: Damage Assessment After Accidental Events 51  
 
 
The primary objective of an “Integrated Emergency Repair Operation” is to minimize 
the instant risk of the ship. And subsequently bring the ship in sheltered water and 
finaly to a repair facility. Before that can be done the ship’s structural integrity should 
be secured. 
 
Lindström (2000) has described a successful in-service repair welding operation of a 
ships hull plate in the way of its conection to the tank top. The in side hull plate was 
built up by means of welding during ballast voyages cross the North Atlantic Ocean at 
a speed of about 15 knot. The actual damage repaired was very similar to the grooving 
corosion illustrated in Figure 19, described in IACS Rec. 96. (IACS, 2007). 
 
 
Figure 19: Illustration of grooving corrosion in the way of the hull plate and the tank 
top 
 
The welding- and marine engineering principles for the technique used. To control the 
enhanced cooling ratio, from the cold sea water on the reverse side of the shell plating, 
has been described by Lindstrom and Ulfvarsson (2002, 2003), Lindstom, and Faraji, 
(2004) and Lindstrom (2005). 
 
Thus the condition of preservation of the longitudinal strength, as a rule, is carried out 
for vessels with small damages to storm conditions and vessels with strongly damaged 
hull in absence of the wave additive and at active struggle for survivability by crew and 
experts of rescuers, including measures on temporary repair.   
 
As a methods of temporary repair, see RS (2004), Caridis (2001) temporary 
reinforcements, cement boxes, etc. are supposed.

At repair of girders by strengthening of reinforcement its elements it is necessary to 
provide strengthening on all length of span. For reinforcement of girders double plates 
on walls and face plates, and also girders from rolled bars can be used. Recommended 
scheme of reinforcements of the worn out girders are given on the Figure 23.  
 
The reinforcement of the deformed element of the hull or its area can be executed with 
the help of the following means:  
 
• cords (double plates, see Figure 24);  
• girders; 
• stiffeners.

All cracks should be considered as critical until it is proved that the cracks are non-
critical. As it is not economically justifiable to waste time and money on evaluations of 
cracks in ship equipment, all cracks founds have to be removed. The following crack 
repair strategy can be observed: 
 
− Cracks in butt- and fillet weld seams shall be gouged out and rewelded with a 
yield strength matching consumable 
− Cracks propagating in a plate, structural- or stiffening member shall be 
cropped out and replaced with an insert, Figure 25

In case of local pitting of structural members may an empirical rule for boilers and 
pressure vessels, be applied. The corroded area can be considered as non-critical in the 
following circumstances: 
  
1. Pitting affected area to be less than 15 % of a ∅ 200 mm circle 
2. Length of the pitting line not to exceed 50 mm 
3. Pit depth not to exceed more than 50% of nominal thickness 
4. Diameter of any pit not to exceed 15 mm  
 
An alternative approach to be used on areas with local corrosion is to consider and 
calclulate the affected area as an unreinforced opening in the actual structural member. 
If the above mentioned approaches have been succesfull should the affected area be 
sand/shot blasted and painted in accordance with the paint manufacturer’s instructions.

calculations for this second phase of work were also completed within a three day 
period and contributed to the safe unloading of the ammunition.  
 
QinetiQ has also implemented an Onboard Risk Performance Hazard Evaluation 
System, ORPHEUS. The system provides bridge staff with the means to quantify the 
risk of operating a ship in extreme weather combining real-time information with a 
database of previously generated data. This system can be a source of solid assumption 
when risk based decisions have to taken with regard to the salvage operation of 
damaged vessels. 
 
Except for the few cases reported below, it seems that risk based approach is not 
formally and systematically adopted when considering the salvage or rescue operations. 
Major salvage companies and oil companies confirmed that no official procedures or 
document are used in order to assess, in a systematic way, the risk related to the 
eventual salvage operations. A famous case, where the salvage operations could have 
been based on risk based approach, is the M/T Prestige accident. Probably, in this case, 
a risk analysis could have helped the Spanish authorities to understand that a safe port 
of refuge was the only solution to the problem avoiding the dramatic consequences. 
7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
The assessment of the strength and safety of a ship in damaged condition and 
consequently the definition of a procedure that should be followed in order to identify 
an emergency response plan after damage, is a complex and challenging task mainly 
because, a) it is a highly non linear problem, b) there is plurality of damaged cases that 
should be considered and it is not apparent which are the most critical for the overall 
safety of the vessel, c) it requires the actual description of the structural elements of the 
vessel rather than a description of the vessels as built. The report described research 
efforts that address these aspects. 
 
Advances have been made on the definition of damage scenarios to be considered at 
the design stage, although additional work and improvements are to be expected in the 
future. 
 
The importance of better quantifying the loading in accidental conditions has been 
recognised and some works have been published. This is a topic in which additional 
work is to be expected and promoted. 
 
A diversity of works has been published on the assessment of the strength of damaged 
structures, an area that appears as being active in research. 
 
Not much work has been reported under salvage and emergency repair. It is 
recommended that the international organizations of competence seriously consider the 
topic of emergency repair and salvage because there is no harmonization between the

ICCGS 原以船舶碰撞與擱淺造成的船舶結構安全性為主要探討對象，
後續在日本與美國陸續加入海事安全與海岸事故等議題，而演變成今日的
會議主題，且由於過於專業，逐漸形成國際上在此領域研究團隊共同交流
的場所，也形成此領域國際合作的平台，筆者參加此次會議除了希望在專
業領域有所收穫外，也想瞭解這個領域跨國合作的討論。 
此次主辦單位 Aalto University 係由 The Helsinki School of Economics, 
Helsinki University of Technology 及 The University of Art and Design 
Helsinki 等三校於 2010 年合併而成，原三校為芬蘭三個優越的專業領域大

Model  
This paper investigated lattice core panel 
examined by McShane (2005), the honeycomb core 
panel examined by Paik(1999), the X-plate core, Y-
plate core and flat plate core double hull structures 
examined by Klanac et al (2005) shown in figure 1.  
Figure 1 Different type of structures (dimension in mm). 
The plate thickness of each model is shown in the lower 
part of each sub-figures and also listed in Table 1. The 
analysis domain of each model is length x breadth = 6m 
x 4m.  The stiffened plate with girder structure was 
selected as reference for comparison. About the same 
global moment of inertia was set for each model, and 
the mass and depth of each model has difference, shown 
in table 1. The thickness of the top and bottom plate for 
each double hull structures and stiffened plate is 5mm.

The boundary conditions were specified as shown in 
figure 2(a); two opposite sides are symmetrical 
boundary conditions to represent the un-supported 
sides, the another two are considered as one constrained 
side to simulate the support of bulkheads, the other is 
symmetrical condition.

The material constants of steel are listed in Table 
2. The Belytschko-Tsay shell element is used for the 
FE-model of the double hull and stiffened plate 
structures; the element size in this paper was set as 
50mm. The effect of stain rate on yield strength is 
modeled using the Cowper and Symonds strain rate 
model (1957).

Analysis items 
The following analyses were performed in this 
paper. 
1. Static analysis: 1kN/m2 uniformly distributed 
load was applied on top plate of each model to 
examine their global stiffness and relative stress 
levels, and then their yield loading was 
determined. 
2.  Linear buckling analysis: The buckling loads of 
different structures under uniformly distributed 
load applied on top plate were examined. 
3.  Impact analysis: The top plate was struck by a 
steel conical body with 45o half conic angle and 
with a sphere head of 200mm diameter. The 
crashworthiness of each structure was evaluated. 
Results of static analysis  
The static analysis was performed with ANSYS 
code. 1kN/m2 uniformly distributed load was applied on 
the top plate of each model as shown in figure 2(a). The 
distribution of equivalent stress on the top plate for 
honeycomb, lattice core and flat core type double hull 
structures are shown in figure 3.

damage modes of Y-type core and stiffener plate are the 
combined mode of core plate (or stiffener) denting and 
webplate buckling. 
Figure 6 The damage states of different type of structures under Case 
A when the top plate began to rupture.
The damage state of flat plate core and X-type 
core structures are similar to Y-type core structure, 
therefore they were not shown in this figure. Figure 7 
represents the damaged states of core, web and bottom 
plate of honeycomb, lattice-core, Y-type core and X-
type core double hull  structures  under case A when the 
bottom plates started to rupture. The damage states of 
lattice core double are similar to honeycombs.
Figure 7 The damage states of different type of structures under Case 
A when the bottom plate began to rupture. 
Similar damage states of different type of 
structures under case B are shown in figure 8 and figure 
9.  
Figure 8 The damage states of different type of structures under Case 
B when the top plate began to rupture. 
Figure 9 The damage states of different type of structures under Case 
B when the bottom plate began to rupture.
The calculated reaction force and energy 
dissipation of different types of structures when the top 
plate and bottom plate began to ruptured are listed in

4. The Y-type core double hull is relative more flexible 
during the collision, and has higher indentation 
depth and energy dissipation before the bottom plate 
began to rupture. 
5. The double structure has superiority over the 
traditional stiffened plate structures with deep girder 
not only in uniformly distributed stiffness, smaller 
depth, and lighter weight. Although the stiffened 
plate structure has higher reaction force and energy 
dissipation than double hull structures when top 
plate damaged; nevertheless, the double hulls 
provides an additional protection, and has higher 
reserved reaction force and energy dissipation 
correlated with higher indentation depth until the 
bottom plate ruptured.
