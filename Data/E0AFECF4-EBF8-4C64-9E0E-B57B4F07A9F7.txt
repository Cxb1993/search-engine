maximum thermal errors contributes 17 micrometer, 
while the centrifugal force contributes 7micrometer. 
The combined error magnitude of the thermal-induced 
and centrifugal-force-induced errors can affect the 
axial positioning error of the PM spindle up to 20 
micrometer.  This project is conducted to develop a 
compensation methodology which can compensate for 
both the thermal-induced and centrifugal-force-
induced errors. Another challenge of this project is 
to study the possibility to reduce the extra-
temperatures or displacement sensors which are 
usually required to install on the spindle structure. 
Our goal is to develop a thermal error compensation 
model without the need of these extra-senor inputs 
which the accuracy of the thermal error model must 
not be sacrificed. The idea is to utilize the spindle 
status information (such as spindle speed, spindle 
current and stator temperature) from the motor 
driver.  The advantage of the proposed model is much 
simple wire installation.  The influence by the 
environment factors such as cutting fluid and spindle 
coolant system can be eliminated.  We use correlation 
analysis method to identify the temperature sensor 
location which has the maximum correlation 
coefficient with the axial dynamic thermal error.  A 
dynamic error model which considers both the thermal-
induced error and centrifugal-force-induced error is 
proposed and successfully demonstrated to reduce the 
spindle error from 17 micrometers to less than 3 
micrometers.
