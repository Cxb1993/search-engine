2. Motivation and Challenges (緣由與目的) 
2.1. Design for Manufacturing/Yield 
As the technology advances at a breathtaking speed, feature sizes and voltage levels are 
decreasing while die sizes, operating frequency, design complexities, wiring level, and 
packing density are increasing drastically in modern VLSI design. These trends result in 
many stringent challenges in design for manufacturing and yield and open many research 
topics. We give some example challenges in the following: 
I. Power and Thermal 
• Leakage power consumption: While static power in modern technology mainly 
comes from leakage current, multiple VT CMOS and additional sleep 
transistors are popular methods to reduce the leakage current. 
• Dynamic power consumption: Lowering the power supply voltage is an 
effective technique to reduce the dynamic power. Under performance 
constraints, it is desired to assign cells along non-critical paths with lower 
power supply voltages for power saving. Thus the timing slack available on 
non-critical paths can be effectively converted to power savings. 
• Thermal: Ignoring thermal effects may increase significant timing violations 
and fail in electromigration (EM) requirements in interconnects. In sub-100nm 
process, the increased temperature will not only decrease the reliability, but 
also increase the leakage current. Currently, considering thermal issue is a part 
of the modern design flow. 
II. Subwavelength Lithography  
• Process variation: Process variation incurred from subwavelength lithography 
has become a crucial challenge of nanometer IC designs. Statistical analysis 
and optimization as well as deterministic modeling of process variation have 
attracted much attention. The impacts of process variation on circuit area, delay, 
power, thermal, and EM reliability need to be explored and optimized. 
• Optical proximity correction (OPC) and Phase Shift Masking (PSM): The sub-
wavelength lithography introduces a huge burden in the manufacturing process 
because the diffraction of light physically limits the critical dimension (CD), 
such as the shortest length of the gate channel. The distortions in optical 
lithography include corner rounding, pulling back at the end of the narrow line, 
and the wide variation of line widths. To compensate for the distortion or 
cancel out the interference from the neighboring light diffractions, OPC and 
PSM have been demonstrated to show significant improvements in sub-
wavelength lithography technology. OPC works by adding or subtracting some 
 2
conventional working model is not adequate any more. Moreover, the sensitivity of 
product manufacturing to variations in design and process parameters has risen 
dramatically. Consequently, there should be a close cooperation between design and 
manufacturing to improve the yield and enable the profitable production of future 
integrated circuits. 
 Consequently, from the manufacturing point of view, we identify three significant 
challenges for manufacturing and design domains: 
 
I. Performance: Circuit modeling related to process-induced nonideal patterning [10] 
DFM/MFD-aware circuit models can enable fabrication engineers to predict circuit 
variability based on circuit design and characterized sources of variation. This includes 
the analysis of the variation of circuit parameters due to poor ILS (image log-slope), 
defocus, misalignment, aberrations in the lens, and overexposure. The potential 
advantage of such DFM/MFD-aware circuit models is that the problem areas (aka “hot 
spots”) in a layout can be identified and quantified in terms of delay and leakage. As a 
result, design and process engineers can collaborate together on a feasible and potentially 
an optimal solution to the DFM/MFD problem. Therefore, the circuit model allows for 
injecting process variations, evaluating circuit design techniques and circuit performance 
for process robustness, and for simulation optimization. 
As an example: Due to the corner rounding and proximity effects, it has been shown that 
using simulated CDs for gate length in circuit analysis, instead of the drawn or designed 
gate lengths, can yield a significantly different results. This becomes less trivial as the 
printed poly gates on the wafer start having across gate CD variation. Currently, for the 
circuit models well defined in SPICE software, all of them are associated with some 
rectangular gate shape. However, the actual gate shape after OPC processing has to be 
adjusted to be non-rectangular. Consequently, a DFM/MFD-aware circuit model should 
provide a methodology to transform a transistor with across gate CD variation to the 
effective length such that the transistor could be analyzed using the shape of effective 
poly gate shape, such that circuit performance can be more realistically predicted. 
 
II. Yield: Yield improvement related to lithography RETs with design intent 
With the transition to sub-100nm feature processes and serious non-ideal sub-wavelength 
lithography effects, the yield problem is moving up into the design flow [4]. Design and 
process technology complexities have resulted in tremendous obstacles to IC profitability, 
quality, and time to market. Traditionally, the yield problem was usually considered to be 
a manufacturing only problem. The manufacturing engineers provide many rules 
associated with the fab information abstracted in a form of a DRC rule-deck. This 
provides a binary “yes” or “no” answer to whether or not a design is compliant with 
feature-based design rules. This allows designer to make sure that the IC can be 
manufactured and can function well. But this approach becomes problematic as the 
feature sizes of IC designs keep shrinking. The serious problem is that the number of 
such rules is increasing dramatically with each new technology node. Consequently, the 
rule-based model is no longer adequate. Instead, the model-based model is appropriate 
[9]. From the manufacturing point of view, while manufacturing with the design intent, 
we could understand the function of circuit and apply suitable resolution enhancement 
techniques for the spot nodes to efficiently improve the yield. Or, the manufacturing

Figure 1 Distortions on wafer 
(Design shapes are in orange, and shapes on a wafer are in red.) 
The OPC operations will change layout shapes, as an example shown in Figure 2. In 
some situations, larger spacing between design shapes can lower the distortion and avoid 
this problem, but it also increases the chip area and cost. It is thus desirable to consider 
the trade-off between distortions and design constraints. Many researchers tried to 
minimize the distortions of pre-OPC shapes. Nevertheless, OPC typically changes design 
shapes significantly and also adds new shapes. Therefore, it is not sufficient to consider 
only pre-OPC shapes. Instead, it is of importance to consider the effects of routing 
patterns and spacing on OPC. An OPC-aware router should reserve the necessary routing 
resource with the aid of the behavior prediction of an OPC tool. The router should 
consider post-OPC shapes and traditional design objectives of routers as well. 
 
Figure 2 Shapes with/without RET 
SRAF has also been employed to improve the lithography process. The use of SRAFs 
provides a means of recovering the process window for pitches that are not enhanced by 
the off-axis illumination (OAI). Additional long and thin rectangular shapes which are 
placed on masks along the length or the extent of main mask shapes. By creating non-
printing supplementary patterns next to the primary patterns, the overall process window 
can be improved. Therefore, an SRAF-aware router must reserve some spaces for SRAFs. 
In the sub-65nm process, the PSM approach also becomes a key method to minimize 
distortions because PSM can manufacture smaller feature sizes, get better optical 
resolution, and extend equipment life. Using PSM, additional layout rules must be strictly

parameters from the output data of 2-D device simulation (2-D 0.18μm NMOS as 
example). Figure 5 shows the input data (DC I-V curves) and the extracted results 
(dashed line).

2. After discussed with team of Subtask 1, we came with a summary as shown in Table 
1. It is useful for us to build up the common OPC database. For manufacturing team, 
hierarchy methodology can be utilized to decrease the OPC effort as design team 
provides some guidance to perceive where hot spots on the circuit are. Meanwhile, 
for design team, the duplicated OPC pattern can be interpreted as cost function to be 
inserted to the OPC-aware routing engine.

variability into performance and power consumption variability.
