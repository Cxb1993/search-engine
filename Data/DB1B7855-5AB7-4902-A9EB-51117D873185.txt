Abstract 
The analysis and design of the microstrip-fed / 
coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed spiral slot 
antenna and filters have been proposed and 
presented. Meanwhile, the integration and the 
antennas and filters can be applied in most of the 
commercial wireless communication systems  
First, the spiral slot antenna and the 
feeding structure were fabricated on the same 
plane of the substrate so that the circuit process 
and the position alignment could be simplified.  
The CPW-fed spiral slot antenna possessing the 
ultra-wideband characteristic is also suitable for 
the integration with the MMIC module.  The 
variations of the measured initial resonant 
 6
fabricated and measured, including the CPW-fed 
spiral slot antenna, one with circularly microstrip 
stub and one with the short pin.  Figure 1 
presents the schematic diagram of the CPW-fed 
spiral slot antenna with the seven turns. The 
feeding structure and the spiral radiator were 
designed on the top plane of the substrate so that 
the circuit fabrication and the position alignment 
could be simplified. In order to derive the details 
of the CPW-fed spiral slot antenna, we changed 
the substrate thickness, the turn number and the 
slot width.  The schematic diagram of the 
CPW-fed spiral slot antenna with the circularly 
microstrip stub at the end of the feedline is 
shown in Fig. 2.  The inner parts including the 
feedline and the slot were replaced by the 
circularly microstrip stub.  We changed the 
radius of the circularly microstrip stub to 
observe the variations of the initial resonant 
frequency in order to find the optimal radius. 
Figure 3 presents the schematic of the CPW-fed 
spiral slot antenna with the short pin.  The short 
pin terminated the spiral feedline and slot.  The 
loading effect due to the addition of the 
capacitances in the circuit would be enhanced so 
that the initial resonant frequency should be 
reduced.   
 
三、實驗數據 
Figure 4 illustrates the comparison of the 
simulated and measured reflection coefficients 
of the CPW-fed spiral slot antenna with the 
seven turns.  The measured initial resonant 
frequency fini of the antenna was 1.60 GHz, 
approximately.  Figure 5 shows the variations 
of the substrate thickness versus the measured 
initial resonant frequency of the CPW-fed spiral 
slot antenna.  The measured initial resonant 
frequency was reduced as the substrate thickness 
increased.  The measured comparison of the 
operating frequency versus the reflection 
coefficient with the different turns for the 
CPW-fed spiral slot antenna is presented in Fig. 
6.  According to the experimental results, the 
antenna efficiency was improved if the turn 
number increased.  The measured comparison 
of the operating frequency versus the reflection 
coefficient with the different slot widths for the 
CPW-fed spiral slot antenna is shown in Fig. 7.  
It was found that the antenna efficiency was 
enhanced due to the better characteristic 
impedance of the CPW transmission line.  
Figure 8 presents the comparison of the 
measured reflection coefficients of the CPW-fed 
spiral slot antenna with the seven turns and one 
with the circular stub at the end of the feedline.  
The measured initial resonant frequency was 
successfully shifted from 1.60 GHz to 1.15 GHz.  
The reduction of the measured initial resonant 
frequency was 450 MHz. Figure 9 presents the 
variations of the measured initial resonant 
frequency of the antenna versus the radius of the 
circularly microstrip stub. Figure 10 depicts the 
comparison of the measured reflection 
coefficients of the original CPW-fed spiral slot 
antenna and one with the short pin. The 
variations of the measured initial resonant 
frequency of the antenna versus the length of the 
short pin at different angles are shown in Fig. 11.

designing the center frequency of the forbidden 
band at 4 GHz and the cutoff frequency of the 
low-pass filter at 6 GHz, the band-selective filter 
operated below 2.8 GHz and at the range of 
5.0 – 6.0 GHz could be realized.A stopband filter, 
the defected ground structure (DGS), was etched 
on the ground plane such the filter could be 
miniaturized. The DGS filter was designed at the 
7 GHz. In order to extract the LC-equivalent 
model of the microstrip filter and derive the 
values, we used the method -of-moment (MoM) 
simulator and the high-frequency circuit 
simulator to simulate the filter circuit. The 
antenna module, including the modified spiral 
slot antenna and the microstrip filter, is shown in 
Fig. 14 and was tested. 
 
三、實驗數據 
We utilized the EM simulation tool, 
Ansoft Ensemble V9.0 and the high-frequency 
circuit simulation software, Microwave Office 
2002, to calculate the S-parameters of the 
band-selective filter.  The S-parameters of the 
proposed circuits in this paper were measured by 
using an HP 8510C vector network analyzer.  
Figure 15 and 16 are the comparison of the 
simulated and measured S-parameters of the 
microstrip band-selective filter.  The simulated 
results on the physical dimensions of the filter 
were derived by using Ansoft Ensemble V9.0, 
the full-wave solver.  The passband responses 
were operated below 2.8 GHz and from 5.0 to 
6.0 GHz.  The measured results indicted that 
S11 was lower than –13 dB and S21 was higher 
than –0.7 dB below 2.5 GHz.  Meanwhile, S11 
was lower than –10 dB and S21 was higher 
than –3 dB from 5.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz.  The 
filter exhibited a stop band with a rejection 
better than –17 dB about 4 GHz.  The signal at 
the forbidden band could be effectively 
suppressed due to the virtual ground of the 
quarter-wavelength open stubs.  The measured 
attenuation level at 7.5 GHz was about 11.5 dB.  
After adding the DGS on the ground plane, the 
suppression of the measured transmission loss at 
the higher stop band reached 36 dB.  An 
improvement of 25 dB at 7.5 GHz was achieved.  
According to the transmission-line 
analysis, the equivalent circuit of the 
band-selective filter without the DGS in terms of 
lumped elements L and C is shown in Fig. 17.  
The lumped-element values of the equivalent 
circuit of the transmission lines could be 
calculated approximately by utilizing the 
equations. After be compared to the measured 
frequency response and tuned by using 
Microwave Office 2002, the optimized L-C 
values could be obtained.  The variations 
between the approximated L-C values and 
optimized L-C values may be attributed to the 
fringing effect and the coupling effect between 
two transmission lines.  The simulated 
frequency responses of the filter with the 
optimized L-C values are presented in Fig. 15 
and 16.  The simulated and measured results 
were in good agreement. 
Figure 18 shows the comparison of the 
measured reflection coefficients of the 
ultra-wideband spiral slot antenna and one 
integrated with the microstrip band-selective 
filter.  The proposed antenna module filtered 
the unnecessary signals out at the forbidden 
bands, which were from 2.8 GHz to 5.0 GHz and 
above 6.0 GHz.

（II）Coplanar waveguide 
一、簡介 
Wireless communication systems attract a 
lot of attentions for the pass decades in the world 
because of their advantages, including 
convenience, low cost and easy operation. For 
most of commercial wireless communication 
systems, such as the CDMA (825 ~ 894 MHz), 
GSM (890 ~ 960 MHz), GPS (1227.60 MHz, 
1575.42 MHz), DCS (1710 ~ 1880 MHz), 
Bluetooth (2400 ~ 2484 MHz), WLAN (2400 ~ 
2483.5 MHz, 5725 ~ 5825 MHz), and 
HIPERLAN (5150 ~ 5350 MHz), etc., the used 
bandwidths distribute over below 2.65 GHz and 
form 5 to 6 GHz. It will be a trend for users to 
access multiple services and roam several 
networks by using a single handset or 
communication device. In order to receive the 
signals of the above systems and reduce the 
noise figure, a band-selective antenna module 
can be a research topic. In the past study, we 
have demonstrated a microstrip band-selective 
antenna module by combining a microstrip filter 
and microstrip-fed spiral slot antenna, a 
broadband antenna. Recently, the coplanar 
waveguide (CPW) structure has gradually 
replaced the microstrip-line technology in the 
design of filters due to the merits such as 
insensitive to the substrate thickness, high circuit 
density, low dispersion and radiation losses, ease 
in series and shunt connections, suitability to 
photolithographic fabrication, and no via hole.

III. Studies of a Miniaturized 
CPW-Fed Slot Antenna 
一、簡介 
With the repaid development of wireless 
communication systems, the radiating antennas 
with the low cost and the dual-band operation are 
in demand for various applications, such as the 
wireless local area network (WLAN).  The 
WLAN systems unitize the unlicensed bands, the 
ISM band at 2.4 GHz and 5.2 GHz only for the 
industrial, scientific and medical applications, to 
reduce the cost of the network building.  The 
slot antenna has been investigated since the 
1940s and many research studies have discussed 
the feeding structure, the bandwidth 
characteristics and the radiation phenomenon.  
The slot is etched on the ground plane of the 
substrate and radiation from both sides of the 
substrate is achieved by a microstrip- or 
CPW-fed in a resonator cavity.  In order to 
derive the maximum beam at the broadside 
direction, the length of the slot antenna should be 
limited to one wavelength.  The technology of 
applying two different slot loops in the aperture 
was proposed to create dual bands. 
 
二、設計理念 
The miniaturized CPW-fed slot antenna was 
designed, fabricated and tested.  FR-4 was used 
as a substrate with the dielectric constant of 4.4 
and the substrate thickness of 1.6 mm, 
respectively.  A rectangular slot whose 
dimension was 20 × 20 mm2 was etched on the 
ground plane of the substrate as the radiating 
element. The width W = 20 mm of the slot was 
determined to be about 0.3 λg  (where λg was 
the guided wavelength at 2.4 GHz).  Figure 24

The antenna satisfied the spectrum requirements 
for 2.40-2.48 GHz band and the 5.15-5.35 GHz 
band of IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN.  The 
measured E- and H-plane radiation patterns of 
the co- and cross-polarizations of the proposed 
CPW-fed slot antenna at 2.45 and 5.2 GHz are 
shown in Fig. 30-33.  It is noted that the 
cross-polarization level of the proposed antenna 
is very high, although this could be perhaps 
acceptable for WLAN applications. The resonant 
frequencies of two slot antennas using the 
conventional CPW-fed and multi-slot (N=3) 
feeding structures were about 5.3 GHz and 4.3 
GHz for the same slot area of 20 × 20 mm2.  
The size of the microstrip-fed and proposed 
CPW-fed slot antennas 2.4 GHz were 680 mm2 
and 400 mm2.  Hence, the antenna dimension 
was reduced by 41 %, approximately.  Hence, 
the design of the proposed CPW-fed slot antenna 
could create the dual bands, reduce the resonant 
frequency and miniaturize the antenna size.  
The practical techniques proposed in this paper 
are useful to utilize in the design of the slot 
antenna. 
 
四、結論 
The CPW-fed slot antenna with the 
dual-band performance and the wide bandwidth 
has been presented and experimented.  The 
characteristics and advantages make this antenna 
as an excellent candidate to replace classical 
monopole, helix or patch antenna in WLAN 
applications, and more particularly in dual-band 
communication systems.  Meanwhile, the slot 
size of the proposed CPW-fed slot antenna could 
be reduced approximately by 41 %.

IV. A Stair-step Slot Antenna 
一、簡介 
With the repaid development of wireless 
communication systems, the radiating antennas 
with the low cost and the dual-band operation 
are in demand for various applications, such as 
the wireless local area network (WLAN).  The 
WLAN systems unitize the unlicensed bands, the 
ISM band at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz only for the 
industrial, scientific and medical applications, to 
reduce the network cost.  The slot antenna has 
been investigated since the 1940s and much 
research studies have discussed the bandwidth 
characteristics and the radiation phenomenon.  
The slot is etched on the ground plane of the 
substrate and radiation from both sides of the 
substrate is achieved by a microstrip or CPW 
feed in a resonator cavity.  In order to derive 
the maximum beam at the broadside, the slot 
width should be limited to one wavelength.  
The technology of applying two different slot 
loops in the aperture was proposed to create dual 
bands . 
 
二、設計理念 
Three types of the slot antenna were 
designed, fabricated and tested. FR-4 was used 
as a substrate with the dielectric constant of 4.4 
and the thickness of 0.8 mm, respectively.  The 
schematic configuration of the conventional slot 
antenna is shown in Fig. 34(a).  A rectangular 
slot whose dimension is 34.3 × 10 mm2 is etched 
on the ground plane of the substrate as the 
radiating element. The width W = 34.3 mm of 
the slot is determined to be λg / 2 (where λg is the 
guided wavelength of the lower resonant 
frequency at 2.45 GHz).  The width of a 
microstrip-fed line on the bottom plane of the 
substrate as the probe excitation of the slot 
antenna is 1.4 mm and the characteristic 
impedance is 57Ω.  The feeding line is located 
at an offset of LS = 9 mm from the bottom edge 
of the slot to achieve a better impedance 
matching.   
The first proposed slot antenna is illustrated 
in Fig. 34(b).  The tuning stub is added at the

VI、計劃成果自評 
    本計劃為兩年期計畫，在執行過程中已成
功研製出寬頻螺線槽孔天線、平面濾波器及將
天線與濾波器積體化，並針對其各項結構參數
做系統性測試與分析，得到諸多設計準則；此
外也提出兩種縮小天線面積的方法。最後我們
也研製出雙頻無線通訊系統天線。上述計畫執
行成果可提供產業界與學術界參考與應用。本
計劃研究成果已獲得中華民國發明專利三項
（專利號碼 205081、205082 與 204825 ）和
一項美國專利（專利號碼 US 7034763 ），並
已經發表在知名國際期刊與會議中，成功地提
昇本研究團隊在國內外的能見度。此一前端電
路與天線未來將可以應用於寬頻與整合型之
無線通訊系統。兩種不同饋入形狀的槽孔天
線，則可以應用於雙頻無線區域網路系統中，
結果業已分別發表在 IEEEE 期刊中。綜合論
之，本研究群體在國科會計畫經費支持下，已
獲得相當多研究成果，計畫執行成效良好。
