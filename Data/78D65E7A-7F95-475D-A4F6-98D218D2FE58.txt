Abstract
The multi-element alloy filler method was used to fabricate multi-element alloy
claddings through the tungsten inert gas (TIG) cladding process. The microstructure
and wear properties of Fe-Co-Cr-Ni-Mox multi-element alloy claddings were studied.
Without Mo addition, the claddings only presented a face centered cubic (FCC) solid
solution phase. As the Mo concentration increased, the claddings began to exhibit a
different composition that consisted primarily of a FCC phase, but that also showed
characteristics of an eutectic mixture of the FCC phase and a σ phase. The
microhardness of claddings increased from 210 to 465 HV with the addition of Mo
due to the formation of σ phase. The higher microhardness of claddings resulted in
better wear performance due to the strengthening of the solid solution and the
precipitation
3still maintained a FCC crystal structure after adding 5.2% Mo. No complex diffraction
peaks were observed, thus affirming that the TIG process can be applied to
multi-element alloy cladding. With the addition of subsequent Mo comprising 15.11
to 18.51% of the sample, the XRD patterns show not only a FCC structure, but also a
tetragonal structure that was categorized as NiCoCr-type σ phase. A similar phase was
also reported in Chen’s study [10], which indicated that the σ phase is a solid solution
phase with multicomponents sharing the same structure as the NiCoCr-type phase.

A change in the lattice constant of the FCC phase under different Mo concentration is
shown in Fig. 4. The lattice constant was calculated according XRD results. It shows
that the lattice constant’s spread is synchronized with the gradual increase in Mo
content. This can attributed to the atomic size effect. The atomic size of Fe, Co, Cr, Ni,
and Mo is 0.124, 0.125, 0.125, 0.125 and 0.136 nm, respectively. The atomic sizes of
all of the elements except Mo are quite similar, and the Mo atom is larger than the rest.
The lattice constant of the FCC phase is expected to increase when larger Mo atoms
are added and cause a large degree of lattice distortion.
Other papers have also reported that using Al will increase lattice constant of
both body centered cubic (BCC) and FCC solid solution phases in multi-component
alloy systems due to its larger atomic size (0.143 nm) [11-12]. Fig. 5 shows the
increase of hardness with the gradual addition of Mo. The hardness was improved
from 210 to 465 HV. This phenomenon can be explained by considering the larger
atomic size of the Mo compared to the other elements, and it has two effects on the
claddings.
First, the Mo-free and 5.2% Mo claddings only show a FCC phase, but the lattice

Mo specimens.
The thermal analysis results of claddings by differential thermal analysis (DTA) are
plotted in Fig.6. The thermal analysis curve depicts the melting temperatures. It shows
an evident trend toward a lower melting temperature with increasing Mo content.
Mo has an eutectic reaction with Fe, Ni and Co at 1450, 1309, and 1337℃,
respectively, which near the DTA results. Combining the DTA results and
microstructure allows a binary diagram sketch to be drawn as plotted in Fig. 7. A
similar alloy system was studied by Wang and compared with this investigation [14].
Wang pointed out that at low concentrations of Ti in their FCC solid solution matrix,
the alloy still maintained a single FCC phase. As the concentration of Ti increased,
the Ti gradually encouraged the formation of Laves phase [14]. According to Fig. 7,
the increasing Mo system has similar phase diagram to that of an increasing Ti system,
as seen in reference 14. Compared with Ti addition in Fig. 7, the addition of Mo has a
higher eutectic temperature due to Mo having a higher melting temperature than Ti.
Fig. 7 clearly reveals that the low concentrations of Mo only include a FCC phase
when solidified from liquid. However, at higher concentrations of Mo, the FCC phase
first separates out of the liquid as the primary phase, and then undergoes an eutectic
reaction with σ phase, which results in interdendrites.

deformation.

Conclusion
A series of Mo-Cr-Fe-Ni-Co multi-element alloy claddings have been
successfully fabricated through a TIG process. The claddings possessed only a FCC
phase in Mo-free and low Mo content conditions. With increasing Mo concentration,
a σ phase formed in interdendrites and presented an eutectic structure with a FCC
phase when the Mo concentration reached 19.51%. The microhardness of claddings
increased from 210 to 465 HV with increasing Mo concentrations from 0 to 19.51%.
The wear resistance was also distinctly improved due to the increased hardness. The
strengthening mechanisms are thought to be to the solid solution strength and the
precipitation strength of the σ phase.

Abstract 
 
TaN-Ag nanocomposite thin films with Ag nanoparticles dispersed in TaN matrix 
and surface were prepared by reactive co-sputtering of Ta and Ag in the plasma of N2 and 
Ar. The films were then annealed using RTA (Rapid Thermal Annealing) at various 
annealing time and annealing temperature to induce the nucleation and growth of Ag 
particles in TaN matrix and on film surface. TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and 
FESEM (field emission scanning electron microscopy) were applied to examine the 
microstructure and surface morphology of TaN-Ag thin films. It is found that Ag tends to 
precipitate on the columnar boundaries when Ag concentration is low. In this case, the 
hardness as well as the toughness can be enhanced. When Ag concentration is high, the 
columnar structure is totally disrupted. The Ag is in the form of many individual clusters. 
In this case, the hardness as well as the toughness is weakened. Overall, the results reveal 
that the hardness and toughness of these films can be controlled by varying Ag contents 
and annealing conditions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results are then used to explain the effects of RTA on the mechanical properties of 
TaN-Ag nanocomposite thin films. An attempt is made to explain why the hardness and 
toughness of TaN-Ag nanocomposite films sometimes can be improved, and sometimes 
not. 
2. Experimental methods 
TaN-Ag thin films were prepared using reactive co-sputtering with Ta and Ag targets. 
Each target has a diameter of 50 mm and was tilted by 30o. The distance of target-to-target 
and target-to-substrate is 150 mm and 100 mm respectively. For deposition, the sputtering 
system was first pumped down to 7x10-4 Pa and then Ar gas (35 sccm) was introduced to 
fill the chamber up to 0.65 Pa. During deposition, the power of Ta was kept at 170 W and 
the power of Ag was varied in order to prepare films with various Ag concentrations. N2 
gas was added at 4.5 sccm to produce stoichiometric TaN. The substrates were Si (100) 
wafers. During deposition, there was no additional heating and the substrate temperature 
was measured to be less than 100 oC. The thickness of these films was about 700 nm. 
Some deposited films were annealed for  3 and 8 minutes at either 350, 400, or 450 ℃ 
respectively using rapid thermal annealing (RTA) system (SJ, ARTS-150) with ramping 
rate set at 100 oC/sec. The films’ preparation conditions are shown in Table 1.  
The phases of the deposited films, before and after annealing, were examined by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) technique. The X-ray diffractometer (Philips PW 1830) used 
monochromatic high intensity Cu Kα radiation (λ= 1.514 A). The scanning angle was 
from 25o-2θ to 65o-2θ, with a step size of 0.02o and a measuring time of 1.25 second per 
step. Through this examination, the forming of Ag phase after annealing could be 
confirmed. The grain size of TaN was calculated using Scherrer formula. 
eventually disrupt the growth of columnar structure, which in turn may change the 
mechanical properties of the film. This structure evolution is similar to that predicted by 
Barna and Adamik model [16]. 
Figure 2 shows the cross-sectional TEM micrograph in dark field. It can be seen that TaN 
column width becomes smaller with the addition of Ag (Figure 2a to 2b). Eventually the 
columnar structure is found disappeared (Figure 2c). Apparently, the addition of 10.1 at. % 
Ag disrupts the growth of columnar structure. Zeman et al. [17] also reported that 
incorporation of  7 at. % of Cu will cause ZrN columnar structure to disappear. 
Figure 3a shows another cross-sectional TEM micrograph on an annealed TaN-Ag sample 
with 1.6 at. % Ag. It can be observed that many precipitates form at the columnar 
boundaries. According to Zeman et al. [17], nanocomposite thin films with soft metals as 
their second phase may have significant increase in hardness after annealing only when (i) 
Cu content is low, and (ii) matrix is strongly oriented with dense columnar structure. 
Under these conditions, the nitride columnar grains may be surrounded or separated by a 
very thin and uniform soft layer after annealing. This may result in an increase in hardness 
as well as toughness. Figure 3b enlarges the image of 3a, and focuses on a grain boundary 
area. It is found the boundary gap is around 1 nm. Also shown in Figure 3b is the 
corresponding Fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern which demonstrates the possible 
boundary structure. From this pattern, it can be observed that an amorphous phase and Ag 
nano-crystalline phase co-exist within this region.  
Figure 4 shows the surface SEM micrographs of the films with various Ag contents, 
annealed at 350 oC for 8 minutes. With the increase of Ag contents, the size of the Ag 
particles increases. Interestingly, some Ag nano-rods can be seen, as shown in Figure 4c. 
Figure 5 shows the SEM micrographs of the TaN-Ag(10.1) films. With the increase of 
annealing temperature, the particle size is increased. As for the formation of Ag nano-rods, 
TaN-Ag nanocomposite thin films were prepared using reactive co-sputtering method, 
followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) to induce the nucleation and growth of Ag 
particles in TaN matrix and on film surface. TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and 
FESEM (field emission scanning electron microscopy) were applied to examine the 
microstructure and surface morphology of TaN-Ag thin films. It is found that Ag particles 
(or layers) may emerge on TaN columnar boundaries when Ag concentration is low. In 
this case, the hardness as well as the toughness can be enhanced. In this study, it is found 
1.6 at. % Ag added in TaN film can have the highest hardness and toughness. When Ag 
concentration is high, the columnar structure is totally disrupted. The Ag is possibly in the 
form of many individual clusters after annealing. In this case, the hardness as well as the 
toughness is deteriorated. In sum, TaN-Ag nonocomposite thin films, when properly 
processed, their hardness and toughness can be enhanced.

1. INTRODUCTION  
P-type cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has been considered as a promising candidate for possible 
applications in photovoltaic devices. It is a reddish p-type semiconductor with a direct 
forbidden band gap of 2.17eV, an acceptor level of 0.4 eV above the valence band, and donor 
levels of 1.1 eV and 1.3 eV below the conduction band [1]. 
Cu2O has a high optical transparency at wavelengths above 500 nm, and with a high absorption 
coefficient at the wavelength below. Besides non-toxicity and low production cost of Cu2O 
films, the theoretical energy conversion efficiency of 20 % make Cu2O possible to be used as 
an absorber layer in thin film heterojunction solar cells [2]. However, the high resistivity of 
Cu2O (around 50 Ω–cm) would possibly cause the reduction of photocurrent. Recently, it was 
reported, by inserting an Ag thin layer in oxide film, the conductivity could be increased 
dramatically, while the optical transmittance could be varied [3-6]. Ag-inserted indium tin 
oxide (ITO) and ZnO multilayers were both reported to have good electrical and optical 
properties [4-6]. 
The present study used a sequential sputtering process to deposit Cu2O-Ag-Cu2O (CAC) 
multilayered thin films, in an attempt to reduce the films’ electrical resistivity and increase the 
optical absorption in VIS-NIR region. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) was used to study the 
effects of annealing on the optical and electrical properties of the films.  
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
Sputtering process was conducted with a pure copper (99.995 %) and silver (99.995 %) targets 
which were two inches in diameter. Glass substrate (Corning 7059) was placed 60o to the target 
surface with a substrate-to-target distance at 10 cm. The glass substrates were ultrasonically 
cleaned by 5% KOH and rinsed in DI water to remove grease and organic contaminants. 
During deposition, the substrate temperature was kept at 300℃ and the flow rate of argon was 
35 sccm. Oxygen was set at 4 sccm for cuprous oxide deposition. The detailed deposition 
 5 
475 nm, it is observed that the transmittance is decreased with the increase of Ag mass 
thickness. Apparently, the incident light in this range is either absorbed or reflected by the 
additional Ag layer. By examining the absorptance spectra (Figure 3b), it is found that the CAC 
films have a higher absorption within the range of 600 and 800 nm. Peak absorption at 600 nm 
is clearly observed. Figure 4 shows the optical transmittance and absorptance of the CAC films 
that were annealed at 650 oC for 3 min. After annealing, the optical transmittance of Cu2O and 
CAC films increases, due to defect reduction and clustering of Ag particles [7]. Figure 4b 
shows the optical absorptance of these annealed CAC films. Clearly, the absorption in the NIR 
region is greatly improved. This improvement could be quite significant when the films are 
applied in thin film solar cells. A blue shift of the absorption peak at around 600 nm is 
observed. The decrease of the Ag mass thickness would shift the peak to the short wavelength 
side. According to Pillai et al. [7], Ag layer may transform into Ag particles as a result of 
annealing. With the increase of the mass thickness of Ag layer, the formed particles would 
become larger. This would cause the plasmon resonance frequency shifting to the red. These 
resonance peaks are sharper for lower mass thickness and tend to broaden for larger mass 
thicknesses. This is likely due to the increase of the size distributions of Ag particles, and 
possible depolarization effects for larger particles [7].  
3.3. Electrical characteristics 
Figure 5 shows the resistivity of the CAC and single-layered Cu2O films. As seen from this 
figure, the resistivity of the CAC films decreases with the increase of Ag mass thickness. 
However, after annealing, the resistivity of the CAC films increases to the level higher than 
that of pure Cu2O film. This could be attributed to the replacement of continuous Ag layer with 
discontinued Ag particles or clusters. When Ag layer is in a discontinuous form, the electrical 
conductivity is dominated by the oxide matrix. Figure 6 shows the effect of annealing 
temperature on the resistivity of a CAC film inserted with 5-nm Ag inserted between Cu2O 
layers. It can be seen that the resistivity reaches the maximum at 550 oC. Apparently, when
