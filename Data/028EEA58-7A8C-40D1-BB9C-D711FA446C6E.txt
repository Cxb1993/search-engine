1 Introduction 
 
Subwavelength periodic structures provide two attractive capabilities: controllable filtering properties 
and unusually physical properties not seen easily in nature. The utilization of subwavelength arrays 
promise to enhance the performance of existing devices or to offer greater functionality, manipulation, 
and reliability to the further implements. Therefore they have been the subject of tremendous re-
searches over the years. Subwavelength arrays have widespread applications in the electromagnetic 
spectrum. In microwave engineering [1, 2] and far infrared technology [3, 4], subwavelength arrays 
made of conducting materials, known as frequency selective surfaces or screens, possess a variety of 
frequency filtering features involving bandpass, bandstop, fast roll-off wideband, high Q-factor nar-
rowband, multiband,  and polarization selectivity and steering. By means of homogenization for 
subwavelength arrays in quasistatic regime (the lattice constant  is much smaller than a wavelength a
λ , typically / 1/a 5λ < ), the effective parameters can be obtained and give rise to the corresponding 
effective anomalous dispersion, which in turn provide unusual physical phenomena involving negative 
refraction [5-7], trapped rainbow [8], reversed Doppler shift [9, 10], negative Goos-Hanchen shift [11]. 
These kinds of subwavelength arrays are known as  metamaterials  
Historically, The first work of wave propagation in periodic structures is that the derivation for 
the velocity of sound by Newton in seventeenth century [12]. He assumed the propagation of sound 
waves in air was analogous to that of an elastic wave along a lattice of point masses. The work on the 
theory of one-dimensional lattice was continued in eighteenth century, and devoted by Bernoulli, Tay-
lor, Euler, and Lagrange in the study of vibration of strings. In nineteenth century, Cauchy, Ba-
den-Powell and Kevin studied the dispersion relation of one-dimensional lattice of point masses. 
Meanwhile, Fraunhofer built the first reflection gratings with a 12 mm wide grating containing 3600 
grooves inspired by Rittenhouse in 1819, and Rowland made a great contribution in ruled gratings [13, 
14]. 
In 1902, Wood, who succeeded Rowland's researches, discovered the ''anomalous'' behavior of metallic 
gratings [15-17], and Lord Rayleigh developed a theoretical model of these grating to explain certain 
features in 1907 [18]. The major part of the theory of periodic structures was developed in the first 
decade of the twentieth century related to the X-ray diffraction by crystals. Brillouin devoted entirely 
to a comprehensive theory of wave propagation in periodic structures. 
Subwavelength periodic structures  include one-dimensional periodicity such as wire gird grat-
ings[19-21], narrow slits and grooves [22, 23], double-layered gratings [24-26], compound metallic 
gratings [27, 28], compound dielectric gratings [29, 30],  
layered structures [31], and curved gratings [32], two-dimensional periodicity such as rod [33], cylin-
der [34], hexagonal array of cylinders and rods [35, 36],hole [37-40],split-ring resonator [41-43], and 
stripes with various lattice arrangement [2] and three-dimensional periodicity such as woodpiles[44], 
helix [45], tetragonal square spiral structure and diamond structures[46]. Subwavelength arrays pro-

2 Basic Theory, Equations, and concepts 
 
This chapter introduces the problem formulation, basic theory, and concepts needed in the thesis. We 
formulate the governing equations and periodic boundary conditions used in the thesis and describe the 
calculation of reflection and transmission coefficients. Finally, we demonstrate some basic concepts of 
single-stripe/slot subwavelength structures associated with Breit-Wigner resonance which can be de-
scribed by Lorentzian lineshape. 
2.1 Formulations with time-harmonic electromagnetic waves 
Consider electromagnetic waves with time-harmonic  variation in the form i te ω− , where ω  is the 
electromagnetic wave frequency. The simulation results in this thesis primarily were performed by 
means of the COMSOL Multiphysics which is based on the frequency domain finite element methods 
[57] to solve the time-harmonic wave equations obtained from Maxwell's equations in the form 
  (2.1) ( )1 20 0kμ ε−∇× ∇× − =E E
where 0 /k cω=  is the wave number in free space, 0 01/c ε μ=  is  the speed of electromagnetic 
wave in free space. The s-polarized incidence is defined as 0zE =  while the p-polarized incidence is 
defined as 0H =  \cite{Harrington2001:706}, that is, the electric fields and the magz
transverse to the inci
netic fields are 
dent plane for s-polarized and p-polarized incidence, respectively.

2.3 Characteristics of subwavelength conducting arrays  of single 
stripe and Breit-Wigner resonances 
The reflectance spectrum of subwavelength conducting array of stripe versus length is shown in 
FIGURE 2.3(left). For the perfect conducting stripe array with infinitesima
ectrum of 
ementary 
l  
l thickness, a total reflec-
tion with | | 1r ≈  can be attained, regardless of the stripe size. This phenomenon is achieved as long as 
the stripe array is of infinite extent \cite{GarciadeAbajo2007:531}.The transmittance sp
subwavelength conducting array of slot versus length l  are shown in FIGURE 2.3(right). The slot 
arrays are the complementary of the stripe arrays, namely, the two compl arrays are put on 
top of each other, then a "complete" perfectly conducting plane is obtained \cite{Munk2000:202}.

interference phenomenon, the scattering of waves  propagates along different paths resulting in mul-
tiple interference phenomena. The constructive interference corresponds to resonant enhancement 
leading to the peak in the asymmetric lineshape while destructive interference corresponds to resonant 
suppression leading to the dip in the asymmetric lineshape. In another aspect, the appearance of the 
asymmetry can be interpreted as the interaction of a discrete (localized) state with a continuum of 
propagation modes .Up to now, it is clear
und in nuclear, atomic, molecular, and condensed matter physics because the interference phe-
nomenon is independent of matters [64]. In photonics, Fano resonance widely appears in photonic de-
vices and plasmonic nanostructures [61]. 
In the following section, we investigate various multi-stripe subwavelength arrays with Fano 
resonances. The coupling of multiple resonators provide multiple paths of interferences of electro-
magnetic fields and result in Fano resonances. The multiple resonators with asymmetric geometry 
provide the effective continuous states and the effective discrete state. Therefore, in addition to a re-
flection peak associated with the resonance for reflecting arrays, a reflection dip occurs at a nearby 
frequency; the resonance line shape thus becomes asymmetric. The underlying mechanism of Fano 
resonance in subwavelength structure is the close coexistence of con
ences of waves in a system, which leads to the occurrence of reflection (or tran
at nearby frequencies. This feature indicates that there exist two pathways or c
of waves; one gives rise to resonance and the other to antiresonance. 
3.2 Subwavelength array of asymmetric dual stripes 
As mentioned in the previous chapter, a simple geometry such as single-stripe arrays, the Lorentzian 
resonance is the typical and dominated reflection characteristic for patch type subwavelength arrays. 
For multi-stripe arrays, the Fano resonances with Fano lineshape are mainly concerned. First, we con-
sider Fano resonances due to inter-coupling between elements in single-layered subwavelength arrays 
consisting of multiple stripes with asy
 resonances due to intra-coupling between layers in multi-layered subwavelength structures. The 
features of Fano resonances is illustrated with electric fields and surface currents on conducting arrays 
which show asymmetric distributions. 
Consider the subwavelength conducting array as
to 1w , where  / 0.7l a = , 2 / 0.05w a = , / 0.1d a = . 
3.3 Features of multiple Fano resonances 
In order to identify the reflection feature of the dual-stripe arrays, the Fano resonance formula Eq. 
(\ref{fano}) is used to characterize the reflection coefficient. For dual-stripe arrays as in the present 
study, the reflection intensity displays a more intricate behavior and will be sh  characterized 
by the Fano resonance \cite{Fano61}.

In FIGURE 3.3, the optimal Fano parameters for the reflection peak-dip pair on the low-frequency

phases of the reflection and transmission coefficients are also well characterized by the Fano reso-
nance formula, as shown in Fig. FIGURE 3.4. Note that the value of Γ  is smaller than that in 
FIGURE 3.3, indicating that the high-frequency Fano resonance has a narrower width. Note also that 
the Fano parameter has the opposite sign of that in Fig. \r s is consistent 
with the fact that th itions of peak and dip are interchanged for the high-frequency Fano resonance. 
The corresponding phase shifts are exchanged in the same manner. 
3.4 Field distributions of multiple Fano resonances 
The features of mu  Fano resonances are further illustrated with the eld patterns at the corre-
sponding frequencies. FIGURE 3.5 shows the electric field contours and surface current vectors asso-

The electric fields  at

shown in FIGURE 4.3(b). It is shown that the attachment of dielectrics, providing wave guide effect, 
improve the absorption in the subwavelength metallic grating. Without dielectric slabs, the absorbance 
of the single compound-slit aluminium grating is relatively weak, and it is significantly enhanced 
sorbance for dielectric slab on the bottom of metallic grating, the absorbance for the dielectric slab on 
the top of metallic grating can be enhanced.

nm and 614 nm depict a symmetric and an antisymmetric pattern, 
respectively, about the top and bottom surfaces. The former is identified as the antibonding mode and 
the latter as the {\it ode. In particular, as shown in FIGURE 4.5(a), the bonding mode is 
characterized by a symme ment of surface charges on the top and bottom surfaces, while the 
antibonding mode has an antisymmetric charge alignment \cite{Lee09,Hooper2004:630}. Therefore, 
the vertical electric fields associated with the bonding mode point in opposite directions on the two 
surfaces, leading to an antisymm tric pattern of . The antibonding mode, on the other hand, is as-
sociated with a symmetric pattern of vertical electric fields. The above two modes are two standard 
modes that usually occur in thin metallic films [66]. The bonding mode has a lower frequency and a 
larger decay rate (strongly damped), known as short range surface plasmon, while the antibonding 
mode has a higher frequency and a smaller decay rate (weakly damped), and is termed as long range 
surface plasmon  (cf. FIGURE 4.4(a) left) [38, 67]. 
yE

891λ ≈  nm. The fields are strongly concentrated toward the top slab but are almost null on the bot-
tom. This mode is characterized by the appearance of surface charges on only one side (top surface), 
which is different from the bonding or antibonding mode with the surface charges on two sides (top 
and bottom surfaces). The nearly perfect absorption associated with this mode can be understood by 
the drastic different character of scattered fields on the two sides so that both the reflection and trans-
mission can approach zero and all incident power is absorbed in the structure. The highly asymmetric 
pattern depicts a special character of {\it semibonding} mode, which is not observed in simple struc-
tures such as metal films. This feature is reminiscent of the secondary bonding (or semibonding) 
structure of electric charges in atoms or molecules \cite{Alcock72, Alcock90}. It is not a normal 
bonding as in simple molecules and may appear in a more complex system. In the present problem, the 
excitation of semibonding mode provides a mechanism for the phenomenon of perfect (or nearly per-
fect) absorption. This can be understood from the aspect of scattered wave. On the one hand, the 
bonding on the top (incident) side gives rise to surface waves that decay exponentially away from the 
surface. No reflected waves will therefore go to infinity. The lack of bonding on the bottom (transmis-
sion) side, on the other hand, allows propagating waves through the structure and may destructively 
interfere with the incident wave. As a result, the concurrence of zero reflection and zero transmission 
is possible to occur, all the incident power being absorbed in the lossy medium. The drastically differ-
ent nature of the scattered waves on the two sides responds to the special character of a semibonding 
mode.  
In another aspect, the electric fields xE  associated with the three absorption peaks are plotted in 
FIGURE 4.4(b). The field component along the grating surface is m nly responsible for the absorp-
tion in the layered structure. In the present configuration, the fields 
ai
xE  are much more intense on the 
top surface than on the bottom. When ε ′′  of the metal grating (Al) or dielectric slab ( p -Si) becomes 
significant, the absorption tends to be large as well. In FIGURE 4.5(a), the features of bonding, anti-
and semibonding are illustrated with the surface charges distribution. To illustrate the distri-
f absorption in the grating structure, the time-averaged power loss density (per unit volume) 
loss /dP dV ciated with the three absorption peaks is plotted in 
bonding,
