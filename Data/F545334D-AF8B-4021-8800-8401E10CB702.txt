Introduction 
To repair an injury-induced nerve defect, both ends of the injured nerve stumps can be introduced 
into a tubular chamber, which can offer the advantages of minimizing invasion and scarring of the nerve, 
aiding guidance of growing fibers along appropriate paths by mechanical orientation and confinement, 
and enhancing the precision of stump approximation. Several synthetic materials, either nondegradable [1] 
or biodegradable [2-4], have been used as a nerve conduit. In these materials, polylactic acid (PLA), 
which is made from corn, sugar beets or wheat, is an important material in the medical industry that has 
been used for over 30 years. It is a polymer that has good biocompatibility, which can satisfy the request 
for tissue regeneration and repair [5-7]. It is also a biodegradable polymer that can be assimilated by the 
body, and therefore has been largely used in sustained-release drug delivery systems [8,9]. 
Several years ago, my group first fabricated a rotor-twister which could twist multifilament to 
increase yarn strength [10,11]. Using this machine, enormous advances have been made in recent years in 
the development of PLA suture materials. We found that the PLA surgical suture composite with chitosan 
could inhibit bacterial growth and promote wound healing [12,13]. However, these PLA suture materials 
have a low mechanical strength under physiological conditions, thus limiting their applications. To obtain 
adequate mechanical strength, we describe a method of preparation of PLA nerve conduits that uses 
twisted PLA filaments to fabricate a multi-layer tubular construct by microbraiding technique for 
reinforcing a nerve bridge across a 10-mm gap for rat sciatic nerves. Temporal and spatial progresses of 
tissue activity within the conduit were studied. Its biocompatibility and effectiveness as a guidance 
channel for peripheral nerve regeneration were evaluated. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Fabrication of microbraided PLA nerve guide conduits  
Four PLA filaments (Unitika, Japan) were inserted into the rotor-spinning device driven by the 
tangent belt of the motor shown in Figure 1. The ends of the filament were pulled by the take-up roller. 
The filament was then twisted by rotation of the rotor-twister. Sixteen twisted PLA filaments were wound 
on the spindles of the microbraiding machine shown in Figure 2. The ends of the filament from the 
spindles were then pulled to the center of the machine. A silicone rubber mandrel of outer diameter 1.74 
mm was inserted through the convergence point and forming point of the microbraiding machine from the 
bottom and pulled upward. The machine was then switched on to braid, and a singe-layer tubular 
structure of infinite length was obtained. After repeating the foregoing method, a double- and a 
triple-layer braiding tube were then constructed. The braiding tube was then cut to 12 mm and both of its 
ends were melted with a heated penknife to prevent the filaments from unwinding and the mandrel 
removed. The tubes were then immersed into 0.02 M NaOH, cleaned by an ultrasound oscillator for 1 hr, 
rinsed with distilled water, and dried in an oven at 60°C for 30 min. Finally, the tubes were sterilized with 
25 kGy of γ-ray for subsequent implantation. 
rats. Each rat received 6 implants, which were removed upon sacrifice at various times: 1 week, 2 weeks, 
and 4 weeks. At each implantation time, three rats were operated on. The implants were removed and the 
tissue covered implants were prepared for histological evaluation. All animals were maintained in 
facilities approved by the China Medical University for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, 
according to the regulations and standards of the National Science Council of Health of the Republic of 
China. 
 
Histological evaluation 
After retrieval, the tissue-covered implants were fixed in 10% formalin (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) 
for 2 days. Tissue was rinsed in normal saline (Taiyu, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan) and dehydrated in a series of 
graded alcohols (50%, 70%, and 95%; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) for 30 min each. Samples were 
then embedded in paraffin (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) and cut into thin 12-µm sections by using a 
microtome with a dry glass knife. For histomorphometric evaluation, sections were stained with 
hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The tissue reactions to the implants in the 
subcutaneous tissue were evaluated on the basis of the uniformity and thickness of the foreign body 
capsule as well as the inflammation responses under an optical microscope (Olympus IX70, Olympus 
Optical Co., Ltd., Japan). 
 
Microbraided PLA nerve guide conduits implantation 
Thirty adult Sprague-Dawley rats underwent placement of single-, double-, and triple-layers of PLA nerve 
guide conduits, which were removed upon sacrifice at the time point of 8 weeks. For each type of nerve 
guide conduits, 10 rats were operated on. The animals were anesthetized with an inhalational anesthetic 
technique (AErrane® , Baxter, USA). Following the skin incision, fascia and muscle groups were 
separated using blunt dissection, and the right sciatic nerve was severed into proximal and distal segments. 
The proximal stump was then secured with a single 9-0 nylon suture through the epineurium and the outer 
wall of the PLA nerve guide conduits (1.74 mm ID). The distal stump was secured similarly into the other 
end of the chamber. Both the proximal and distal stumps were secured to a depth of 2 mm into the 
chamber, leaving a 10-mm gap between the stumps. The muscle layer was re-approximated with 4-0 
chromic gut sutures, and the skin was closed with 2-0 silk sutures. All animals were housed in 
temperature (22°C) and humidity (45%) controlled rooms with 12-hour light cycles, and they had access 
to food and water ad libitum. 
 
Electrophysiological techniques 
All the animals with apparent nerve regeneration were re-anaesthetized and the sciatic nerve exposed. The 
sciatic nerve was stimulated with supramaximal stimulus intensity through a pair of needle electrodes 
placed directly on the sciatic nerve trunk, 5-mm proximal to the transection site. Amplitude, latency and 
area of the evoked muscle action potentials (MAP) were recorded from gastrocnemius muscles with 
micro-needle electrodes linked to a computer system (Biopac Systems, Inc., USA). The latency was 
measured from stimulus to the takeoff of the first negative deflection. The amplitude and the area under 
the MAP curve from the baseline to the maximal negative peak were calculated. The MAP was used to 
calculate the nerve conductive velocity (NCV), which was carried out by placing the recording electrodes 
in the gastrocnemius muscles and stimulating the sciatic nerve proximally and distally to the PLA nerve 
  
 
Biocompatibility of microbraided PLA nerve guide conduits 
No clinical problems were seen for any of the rats in the postoperative period. At 1 week 
post-implantation, all the PLA nerve guide conduits with different layers persisted maintaining their 
lumens and wall integrity. An acute inflammatory response was characterized by a rapid accumulation of 
cells resembling lymphocytes and macrophages at the site between conduits and their surrounding tissue 
(Figure 4A). At 2 week, a delicate and thin fibrous tissue capsule (less than 20 µm in thickness) was 
present surrounding the whole implant (Figure 4B). Inflammation responses were still obvious with 
abundant inflammatory cells. Neocapillaries were seen dispersing within the fibrous tissue capsule. At the 
time point of 4 weeks (Figure 4C), fibrous tissue capsules became thicker with a compact structure along 
with active neovascularization. Up to this time, the inflammatory reaction decreased remarkably. A 
chronic inflammation reaction was noted with macrophages and giant cells getting around the edges of 
the PLA nerve guide conduits. 
 
 
 
Electrophysiological measurements 
 MAPs were recorded at 8 weeks of post-operation. Measurements of latency, peak amplitude, area 
under the MAP curves, and the NCV were calculated for each nerve (Figures. 5A-5D). As a result, the 
difference of all the measurements among the nerves obtained from the PLA nerve guide conduits with 
different layers did not reach the significant level at p<0.05.  
 
Neurochemical measurements of regenerated nerves 
 In the Western blot analysis, the nerve regenerates in the single and the double had a significantly 
higher expression of GAP-43 compared to those in the triple(Fig. 7a). In addition, the nerve regenerates in 
the double and the single had a significantly lower expression of synapsin I compared to those in the 
single (Fig. 7b). On the contrary, the TGF-β  expression was significantly higher in the groups of double  
and triple  as compared to the single group (Fig. 7c).

Discussion 
The main objection for using non-degradable conduits is that they remain in situ as foreign bodies 
after the nerve has regenerated. To avoid a second surgery to remove the implant and the potential 
confounding factor of post-surgical infection, biodegradable materials seem a more promising apparatus 
to reconstruct nerve gaps. However, swelling of degradable tube walls caused by absorption of body 
fluids can happen during the nerve regenerative processes [17]. The swelling could occlude the lumen and 
therefore impair axonal regeneration. Therefore, materials for the fabrication of nerve guides are required 
to be degrading properly without obvious swelling, as well as suitable mechanical properties to provide 
longitudinal support for the regenerating nerves [18].
