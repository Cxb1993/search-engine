a great effect on the TEC than Sr doping on A-site.[3] The changes of TEC curves are observed due to 
structural change from O- to hR-phase. The report[10] showed TEC of LSGM2020 is 10.47×10-6/oC. 
Literature[11] reported the superstructures existed in LSGM2015 due to the ordering of the oxygen vacancies 
into the planes normal to <100>C from the electron diffraction pattern Z = [110]C. The results were not 
consistent with our study. Maybe it should be judged to the diffraction pattern Z = [1101]hR. The present 
work, the LSGM samples have been prepared by solid state reaction, and the microstructure and electrical 
properties also were measured by a series of instruments. The purpose of work is to discuss the relations 
between the electrical properties and microstructure changes for various compounds.  
2. Experimental procedure 
The La2O3, SrCO3, Ga2O3, and MgO powders were mixed to form the La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-δ samples by 
solid state reaction. La2O3 powder was fired at 1200oC before mixing various powders. The designation of 
La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-δ samples are designed to LSGM(10x)(10y) for x = 0.1~0.2 and y = 0.1~0.2. The 
compound powders were ball-milled in ethanol, and then the slurries were dried. After the dired powder was 
deagglomerated by an agate and mortar, the powders were calcinated at 1250oC. The calcinated powder was 
again ball milled to reduce the size of agglomerated powder for improving the sinterd densification. Then, 
again dired, deagglomerated, and passed through a sieve. Finally, the powder was pressed into disk by 
uniaxial pressing. These pellets were burned out at 550oC and then sintered at 1550oC for 10 and 15 hrs. 
The Au peak was used as the standard peak for XRD analysis. The structure was identified by the 
X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Rigaku DMX2200) with CuKα radiation, operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. The 
scanning range and rate are 2θ = 20o~60o and 2o/min. In addition, the scanning rate of ranges 2θ = 37o ~ 41o 
and 45o ~ 47o is 0.01o/5 s. The XRD data were analyzed by JADE 5.0 software. In order to further obtain the 
crystal structure, the synchrotron XRD was carried out by using BL-13A1 beam line at 15 GeV at NSRRC, 
and the Si (111) monochromator was used to obtain the wavelength of 0.10162623 nm. The scanning range 
and rate are 2θ = 42o ~ 44.5o and 0.01o/5 s. The samples were also analysed in the room temperature by 
micro-Raman spectroscopy using the solid-state Ar ion laser with 532 nm radiation. The incident power is 
10 mW, the diameter of beam is ca. 1 ~ 2 µm and the spectra ranges are 0~500 cm-1 and 550 cm-1~900 cm-1. 
The polished samples were chemically etched and the microstructures were observed by scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) operating at 15 kV and 10 mA. The compositions of samples were analyzed by 
using the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Selected area electron diffraction (SADP) and 
high-resolution images were performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal expansion 
coefficients of samples were measured in air using a Netzsch 402C dilatometer at 25~800°C with a heating 
rate of 5oC/min. The dilatometer was calibrated by the Al2O3 standard. 
Pellets with diameter 1 cm were ground to ~1 mm thickness. Electrodes were formed by screen printing 
silver (Ag) paste on both sides of the samples, then fired at 800oC in air. The AC impedance spectra of the 
samples were measured with a HIOKI-3532-50 frequency response analyzer over 42 Hz to 5×106 Hz with an 
ac voltage 1 V in air, and the operating temperature is from 300oC to 800oC (interval 100oC). The Ag wires 
were used as current collects. Each measurement was kept until the stable data were obtained after thermal 
equibrium. The conductivity of samples (size: 20 mm×2.5 mm×1 mm) was also measured by dc four-probe 
metod, and the voltage was 10 V. The operating temperature is from 500 to 800oC (interval 50oC).

spectrum, seperately.[13] They are 55(Ag), 92(B1g), 101(B3g), 117(B2g), 137(B1g), 147(Ag), 173(B3g), 255(Ag), 
277(Ag), 335(B3g), 357(B1g), 404(B3g), 417(B2g), 433(Ag), 451(B3g), 584(overtone), and 708 (overtone) cm-1 
for O-LaGaO3, and 444(Eg/Eg), 232(Ag), 159(Eg) and 55(Eg) cm-1 for hR-LaGaO3.[13] These bands will 
absent in the cubic symmetry in the Raman spectra.[14]  
Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of LSGM ceramics. The structures could be judged from the references 
[13] and [14], so the LaGaO3 sample has O-structure and other LSGM samples have hR-structure. In this 
study, 13 bands observed between 50~500 cm-1 in O-phase as in the bands of 81, 98, 108, 124, 151, 176, 
257, 278, 345, 373, 408, 436, 454 cm-1, and 5 bands observed between 50~500 cm-1 in hR-phase as in the 
bands of 80, 97, 154, 278, 430 cm-1. The scattering intensigy of Raman bands in the LSGM2020 are lower 
and broading in the 50~500 cm-1 range, therefore it is closer to cubic. For LSGM samples, two active bands 
of ca. 674 and 738 cm-1 appeared, and the intensity of bands depend on the composition. They are probably 
due to decreasing of local symmetry induced by the oxygen vacancies[15] as equation (1).

Scatting intensity of 674 cm-1 band increases slightly with increase of Sr; however, the scatting intensity of 
738 cm-1 band also increases slightly with increase of Mg. So doping Sr and Mg ions are effective to 
produce oxygen vacancies, and improve the ionic conducitiy. So the peak shape of ca. 680~700 cm-1 
changes with variations of local symmetry enviorments induced by the kinds of amounts of dopants.[15] 
The structures of LSGM have obvious changed (Fig. 2(a)~(f)), and the data explained that structure 
cauld be chaged from low symmetric O-phase to high symmetric hR-phase (or C-phase) by doping 
aliovalent ions, and the Raman vibrational modes will decrease with increase of crystal symmetry. Therefore, 
Raman spectra depend on the amount and kind of doping ions, and are sensitive to the structural transitions. 
                         
3.3 Lattice parameters  
The crystal structure of LaGaO3 is O-phase at room temperature, and it could form the hR-, PC-, or 
C-phases by doping the cations of various radii to induce the tilting of GaO6 octahedra. The lattice 
parameters (ahR and chR) and volume (VhR) of hR-LSGM samples were estimated by JADE 5.0 software (Fig. 
3). The volumes are slightly expand, when the amount of Sr2+ ion increases among La1-xSrxGa0.8Mg0.2O3-δ, 
or the amount of Mg2+ ion increases among La0.8Sr0.2Ga1-yMgyO3-δ. The cause is that the ionic radii of Sr2+ 
and Mg2+ are larger than that of La3+ and Ga3+. The lattice parameter varies more sensitively with doping

spectrometer (EDS). Small and darker grains are clearly observed in the grain boundaries (Fig. 5), and the 
chemical analysis was carried out by using EDS in the spots 1 ~ 4 of LSGM1010-10h and LSGM2015-10h. 
The results showed the La:Sr:La:Mg at.% of spots 1 and 3 are c.a. 14.8:1.6:16.2:0.1 and 13.4:2.8:15.2:2.1, 
separately, for matrix, and the spots 2 and 4 are 7.4:6.5:21.4:0 and 7.3:6.8:22.3:0, separately, for secondary 
phase. The secondary phase was identified as SrLaGa3O7, and it concided with the results of XRD. 
3.5 Ionic conductivity  
Figure 6(a) shows the ionic conductivity of LSGM as a function of measuring temperature 
(500~800oC). The conductivity depends strongly on the measuring temperature and dopant amount, and 
increased obviously with increasing of measuring temperature or the Sr and Mg amounts. For higher 
temperature, higher conducitiviy is due to the acceleration of oxygen vacancy migration.[17] The 
conductivities of LSGM1010-10h and LSGM2020-10h are 7.6×10-2 and 0.167 S/cm at 800oC, separately. 
When Sr+Mg are larger than 0.35 moles, the conductivity will higher than 0.16 S/cm at 800oC. In particular, 
Mg ion has a great effect on increasing the ionic conductivity among La1-xSrxGa1-yMgyO3-δ (x + y ≥ 0.35). 
For studying the effect of sintering time on the conductivity, the conductivity obvious decreases for 
prolonging sintering time from 10 to 15 hrs (Fig 6(a)). The conductivities of LSGM2010 and LSGM2020 
decreased from 0.163 (10 hrs) to 0.123 S/cm (15 hrs) and from 0.167 (10 hrs) to 0.138 S/cm (15 hrs) at 
800oC, separately. Since the number of oxygen vacancies increase with increase the amount of Sr and Mg in 
order to maintain electrical neutrality, as a result higher oxygen ion conductivity is theoretically obtained as 
equation (1). When the Sr and Mg contents are fixed, prolonging sintering time will increase process of the 
thermal activation and promote grain growth. The larger grain size will increase the average pathways of 
oxygen ionic migration, so the conductivity decrease. However, it is obvious that ionic conductivities of 
LSGM (x + y ≥ 0.35) in this study are higher than that of ZrO2 or CeO2-base oxides and somewhat lower 
then those of Bi2O3-base oxides.[18] The ionic conductivity can be expressed as σ = 
σ
  exp
-Ea
kT
      (2) 
where σ, σ0, T, Ea, k are the ionic conductivity, pre-exponential factor, absolute temperature, activitation 
energy, and Boltznmann constant, separately. The (Ea) can be calcultated from equation (2). 
Fig. 6(b) is the Arrhenius plot of ln(σT) and 1000/T, and the slope changes obviously at ca. 600~650oC 
(T*). It shuld be that phase transformation occurred or the oxygen ionic conductive mechanism changed at 
T*. Fig. 6(b) show the Ea-L is larger in low temperature (T < T*), and decreases with rising temperature (T > 
T*). The Ea of LSGM1010-10h fell from 1.53 to 0.69 eV as temperature rose from 500oC to 800oC. At T > 
T*, the Ea-H increased from 0.69 to 0.86 eV with increasing of Sr and Mg contents from LSGM1010-10h to 
LSGM2020-10h. The T* also increases with increasing of Sr and Mg contents (x + y ≥ 0.35). 
At T < T*, the vacancies are progressively trapped out into the clusters to form ordered oxygen 
vacancies,[9] the pathways of the oxygen migration become longer when they move by through the oxygen 
vacancies and the Ea is higher. At T > T*, the vacancies are dissolved and distributed uniformly in the 
matrix of oxygen sites, the pathways of the oxygen migration become shorter, and the Ea is small.[9] At T > 
T*, the Ea-H increases slightly with increasing Mg content among La0.8Sr0.2Ga1-yMgyO3-δ-10h, e.g. from 0.74 
eV (y = 0.15), 0.80 eV (y = 0.17), to 0.86 eV (y = 0.2), and it is almost not vary with increasing Sr content 
among La1-xSrxGa0.8Mg0.2O3-δ-10h, e.g. from 0.85 eV (x = 0.1), 0.82 eV (x = 0.15), to 0.86 eV (x = 0.2). 
Beside, the T* rose from 600oC to 650oC for x + y ≥ 0.35 due to the excess oxygen vacancies or lesser rcrit. 
Generally speaking, the Ea also increases slightly for prolongating sintering time from 10 to 15 hrs.

of the grain interior and grain boundary semicircles, and electrode processes are dominant at 500oC. Only a 
single arc was observed and shifted into higher frequencies above 500oC due to strong electrode polarization 
processes.[36-a22] Howerer, the impedance decreases rapidly with increasing temperature due to accelerating 
the oxygen ionic migration and electrode interfacial processes.  
For higher frequence tail appeared in the fourth quadrant at 500 and 600oC (Fig. 8), this is speculated 
that contributed from the inductance (L) of the device and connecting wiring[23], and the mode is designed to 
(R0/Lel)-(Rgi/CPEgi)-(Rgb/CPEgb)-(Re/CPEe). The similar phenomenon also appeared at 700oC and 800oC, 
and the mode corrected to R0-Lel-(Rgi/CPEgi)-(Rgb/CPEgb) -(Re/CPEe).[23] The device and connecting wiring 
contacted with the testing sample will greatly influence the accuracy of measuring resistance at higher 
temperature. When the measuring temperature increases, the variations of the impedance arc will also 
increase and the arc trends toward unstable state above 500oC, so which sample with excellent conductivity 
could not discriminated above 500oC for AC impedance. The AC impedance data only at 300oC and 400oC 
are simulated and to calculate the impedances and the capacitance of grain interior and grain boundary by 
using equation (4).                     C   R !! " # Q!"     (4) 
Where C, R, Q, n are the capacitance, resistance, constant phase element of CPE-T and CPE-P, 
respectively.[24] The CPEgi-P of bulk was about 0.8~1, and it is almost pure capacitance behavior. The 
CPEgb-P of grain-boundary was about 0.36~1. The capacitances for bulk and grain-boundary were 
determined in the ranges 23~99 pF and 26~753 nF at 300~400oC, respectivety. 
The total impedance varied drastically with the Sr and Mg contents at 300 and 400oC, and the lower 
resistance occurred in x+y of about 0.35 (Figs. 8(A)(B) and 9). The LSGM1010 and LSGM1020 samples 
possess larger resistances for grain interior and grian boundary. This is inferred that there are stacking faults 
and defects existed in the samples (Figs. 8 and 12(b)(c)). These defects will trap the oxygen ions and induce 
that oxygen ions need higher energy to immigrate below 500oC. There are not observe the stacking faults 
and defects in the LSGM1520 and LSGM2020 and the resistance slight increases with increase of Sr at 300 
and 400oC, e.g. RLSGM1520 < RLSGM2020, this is because the grain size of LSGM2020 is larger than that of 
LSGM1520 (Figs 7 and 8(A)(B)). For LSGM2015, LSGM2017 and LSGM2020 samples, the resistance of 
grain interior obvious increases with increase of Mg content, e.g. Rgi-LSGM2015 < Rgi-LSGM2017 < Rgi-LSGM2020, 
however, the resistance of grain boundary has not obvious change, this is also due to the grain growth (Fig 
7(a)). The energy barrier of the oxygen ions immigrated along grain interior is higher than that along grain 
boundary at 300 and 400oC, and the volume of grain interior occupy larger fraction in sample than that of 
grain boundary. So the grain size is the predominance for conductivity at 300 ~ 400oC.  
The grain size increases with increasing the sintering time, so there is seem to a trend for grain size 
increases with increasing the total impedance at lower temperatures (300~400oC)(Fig. 9). This may be a 
good explanation for the fast oxygen ions transport along grain boundaries.[25]  
3.7 Thermal expansion analysis  
Fig. 10 shows thermal expansion analyses of the LSGM1010, LSGM1020, LSGM2020, and 
LSGM2015 samples, and the measuring temperature range is from 25oC to 800oC. The TEC increases with 
increase of the measuring temperature. The obvious first discrete shrinkage was observed at 127 and 149oC 
in the LSGM 1010-10h and LSGM 2015-10h due to the phase transition.[26] There is not obvious turning 
point below 200oC for LSGM 1020-10h and LSGM 2020-10h (Fig. 10). TEC of LSGM1010, LSGM1020, 
LSGM2020, and LSGM2015 samples at 200~800oC are in the range of 7×10-6/oC~9.8×10-6/oC, 
 10 
 
Fig. 11 is used to convenient analyse the diffraction patterns and further determine structure phase. 
Figure 12 is the TEM bright field images and selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs) of samples sintered 
at 1500oC/10 h. No defect was observed in the grain B of LaGaO3 specimen, and the patterns were indexed 
to Z = [010]O, [11 1 ]O, and [210]O for O-phase. Stacking faults were obvious observed in the 
LSGM1010-10h, and patterns of grain C were indexed to Z = [2021]hR, [1101]hR, and [0001]hR for hR-phase.  
The patterns were indexed to hR-phase not C-phasec from Z = [1101]hR, and it was not similar to Z = 
[110]C. The density of fine stacking faults or defects were higher in the LSGM1020 and LSGM1520, and 
almost no defect was observed in the LSGM2020. The stacking faults or defects should be induced by the 
aggregation of oxygen vacancies. The grains C to F were all indexed to hR-phase (Fig. 12). The obvious 
streaking wase observed in Fig. 12(e-1)(e-2) as shown by arrows. The tilting degree of octahedron GaO6 
decreases by doping Sr and Mg ions, and also increase the structure sysmetry.[27] So the hR-phase can be 
retained to room temperature by doping Sr and Mg ions. The literature[16] reports when Sr + Mg > 0.35 
moles, the LSGM will transform to C-phase. But the C-phase had not observed in this study.

Figure 12 The TEM bright field images and SADPs of the LSGM samples sintered at 1500oC/10 h.  
4. Conclusions 
LSGM samples can form the Rh-phase by sintering at 1500oC for 10 hrs for solid state reaction. The 
lattice parameters of hR-phase increase with increase of Sr and Mg contents. The average grain sizes also 
increase with increase of the Sr- and Mg-doping content or sintering time. Relative densities of all samples 
reach above 93%. SrLaGa3O7 was observed. hR-LSGM are confirmed by the Raman spectra and SADPs. 
Two active bands of ca. 674 and 738 cm-1 appeared due to decreasing of local symmetry induced by the 
oxygen vacancies. The conductivity increased obviously with increaseof measuring temperature or the Sr 
and Mg amounts, and decreased with increase of grain size. When Sr+Mg > 0.35 moles, the conductivity is 
c.a. 0.164~0.173 S/cm at 800oC. The phase transformation occurred or the oxygen ionic conductive 
mechanism changed at T* of ca. 600oC~650oC. The LSGM1010 and LSGM1020 samples possess larger 
resistances at 300~400oC due to existing stacking faults and defects. Stacking faults gradually decrease with
