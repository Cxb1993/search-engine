穩態微流體系統進行研究開發，以作為未
來實驗室晶片或是微型全分析系統(μ-TAS)
之流體前置處理之應用。本計畫第三年執
行日期為於 2008 年 8 月至 2009 年 10 月

本研究之乃是以非穩態流之流場特性
開發一多功能微流體裝置，以作為實驗室
晶片或是微型全分析系統之流體前置處理
之應用，本裝置可以完成實驗室晶片或微
型全分析系統在分析前之流體混合與微粒
子分離的需求，本研究主要是利用非對稱
擋體結構配合 PZT 壓電片的震動，可在裝
置內產生一非穩態流場，此流場是本裝置
擁有高混合效率與粒子分離效能的基礎。
透過壓電片驅動電壓與工作頻率的改變，
可以控制流體的流動方向。在工作頻率為
1.0kHz 時，可以分別在注入區與三叉型區
域得到 95%以上混合效率與接近 100%的微
粒子分離效率。 
本裝置的體積為34 12 1mm  ，而且只
需一道光罩與一次電感耦合電漿蝕刻製
程，就可以完成整個微流體裝置的製作。
本裝置於微流道中央配置一非對稱擋體，
並於流道二側分別設置三個交錯排列的凸
塊，再配合壓電片所產生的非穩態流場，
而得到一高效能的微混合機制，此外，在
非穩態流場狀況下，流體流經三叉型區域
會有三個現象促使微粒子往二側輸出流道
移動，首先流體在主流道流動時，微粒子
會往流道二側靠近。其次，當流體移動至
三叉型區域時，會因截面積擴大而降低流
速，並在二側產生迴流區，此迴流區會將
微粒子往三叉型區域二側帶動，最後在中
央流道入口端會產生一對稱之渦漩流場，
此渦漩可作為一阻擋微粒子前進之擋體，
造成中央輸出流道的截面積縮減與流阻提
昇，且由於渦漩的旋轉方向是由中央流道
往二側輸出流道旋轉，因此可帶動微粒子
往側邊輸出流道前進，在上述三種現象的
配合下，可以有效達到分離微粒子的效果。 
本研究應用微粒子顯像測速儀配合同
步觸發裝置，以全域照亮法將欲觀測之微
流道全域照亮，以完整了解注入區之非穩
態流場的速度結構與流場特性，並對觀測
結果加以分析歸納。本研究整合上述的研
究成果進行一系統開發，配合理論分析並
結合相關影像處理技術將實驗結果量化，
以對此一多功能微流體裝置的研究開發獲
得完整成果，並建立起一套微流體系統開
發的流程。

結構進行限制；同樣的，當流體往反方向
運動時，動件也會隨著往反方向運動，當
動件的長邊被推至流道凸出狀的尖端結構
位置時，此時閥門就完全閉合，並藉由流
道上的凸出狀結構切斷逆向流體，達到閥
門整流的效果。而在流道幾何結構限制的
情況下，動件的衝程設定在70m。 
 
圖 2 T 型被動式閥門動件 
在之前的研究中，本人曾經利用微粒子
影像測速儀(micro-PIV)量測技術觀察非對
稱擋體式無閥門微幫浦內的流場特性
(Sheen et al.，2008)，獲得單一週期內之出
口速度與時間變化之關係，如圖 3 所示。 
圖 3 非對秤擋體式無閥門微幫浦在不同操作頻率
下的出口流速隨時間變化關係圖 
在不同操作頻率下的結果，正值為流體
往出口方向，負值則為逆流，結果可發現
流速隨時間變化的峰值僅與驅動電壓與共
振頻率有關，而正向與逆向的最大速度值
則相當接近，將此速度剖面隨時間積分
後，則可得到淨流量值，圖 4 則根據圖 3
進一步分析，將正向與逆向個別積分並定
義出整體導流效率，即正向流量與逆向流
量的比值，結果可發現即使在最佳的操作
頻率時，正向流量與逆向流量的比值僅達
到 1.12，實驗結果證明無閥門幫浦在往復
運動一周期，每次循環所產生的淨流量效
能遠低於理論及數值模擬的預測，顯然將
驅動元件的能量轉換為淨向流體動能的效
率上偏低，因此為了提高所需的流量，只
能提高電壓。此外，由於無閥門幫浦內的
流場是具有往復性的，因此在用於具感應
器之生醫流體檢測上，將產生無可避免之
干擾，如影響感測器對於速度及溫度的判
讀。

向流體流速對時間積分後的結果，及正向與逆

2.3 閥門動件運動理論分析 
過去在無閥門微型幫浦對於整流效率
的分析上，主要以流體導流率作為閥門效
能評估的指標，其定義如下： 
R
F
   (1)
其中 為閥門的導流率， F 為流體往出口
處聽過閥門的壓力損失係數，而 R 為流體
逆向通過閥門的壓力損失係數，由於較高
的壓力損失係數表示壓力損失的增加將減
少通過的流量，因此當逆向流具有較高的

然而由於壓電片在製作過程中，有許多的

過程的溫度調整與時間控制等等，都會使
得不同批次製作的壓電片有性能上的差

的判斷，所以本研究使用雷射都卜勒光學

流體裝置上的震幅，以有利於後續分析，
該設備由李世光老師奈米生醫微機電系統

圖 5(a)與(b)分別為正弦波(sine wave)與
方形波(square wave)的實驗結果，驅動電壓
為 20Vpp，此時壓電片下方震動腔內為空
氣，圖 3(a)與(b)分別為正弦波與方形波，
驅動電壓為 40Vpp，工作頻率則同樣為
1kHz。由圖中的波形可以發現，壓電片可
以反應出正弦波的波形變化，而輸入方形
波時，震幅變化則為不連續，因為方形波
可以視為許多 harmonic waves 的組合，而
正弦波本身就是一種 harmonic wave，當震
動腔內的流體為空氣時，在輸入相同的驅
動電壓與工作頻率下，正弦波的震幅會高
於方形波，然而當震動腔內的流體為水
時，由於水具有不可壓縮性，且會因受壓
電片的驅動而在裝置內流動進而產生阻
力，而根據前人的實驗結果，方形波驅動
流體的效果高於正弦波，因此結果使得方
形波的震幅會高於正弦波。圖 6(a)與(b)為
震動腔內的流體為水時，在二種輸入波形
不同驅動電壓下，壓電片下隨著頻率改變
的震幅變化，由圖中的結果可以發現，壓
電片的震幅會隨著頻率的增加而減少，且
方形波的震幅較正弦波為高。

圖10為Uchida[6]所提到之振盪圓管流
的速度剖面圖，在同一周期、不同時間點

變化曲線可以得知，位於流道中心及位於
壁面附近的流層已有明顯的相位偏移。將
本裝置的操作條件 ( 0.5 3 kHzsf   )代
入，可以得知 y值的範圍為 92-126 μm，當
1.0 kHzsf  時，y值為 109.18 μm，而本裝
置中之微流道剖面為方形，微流道的寬度
為 300μm，流道中心與壁面距離為 150 
μm，因此可以得知，最大的流速會發生在
距離壁面 58-24 μm 處， 
由圖 11(a) 可以看到微粒子會偏離主
流道流道的中央而往二側移動。當流體繼
續往下游移動至三叉型區域時，則會因截
面積擴大而降低流速，微粒子也將更往三
叉型區域的二側移動，如圖 8(b)所示，再配
合非穩態流場，於中央流道入口端所產生
之對稱渦漩流場，可有效的將微粒子予以

由於微粒子的最高速度會發生在靠近
微流道二側的位置，因此在量測主流道中
微粒子的運動速度時，是紀錄流道二側粒
子的運動狀態加以分析。實驗的初始條件
是將入口端與出口端的水平面維持一致，

器，然後由功率放大器在波形不變的前提

圖 14 為 Type 1 與 Type 2 在 80Vpp，

Type 2 的幫浦效能較高，雖然 Type 2 多了
一個流道的注入口使得流阻增加，可是也
在震動腔與主流道中間多了一個擴張角為
2.5°的 diffuser，此設計乃是參考圖 2.3 的內
容所設計，因此幫浦效能較 Type 1 高。Type 
2 有二個明顯的峰值 1-1.1 kHz 與 1.5-1.6 
kHz，二者間的距離很近，吾人推測 1-1.1 
kHz 是與非對稱擋體有關，而 1.5-1.6 kHz
則是與漸張管有關。此外，值得注意的是
在 0.5-3 kHz 間，Type 2 並沒有發生流場逆
向的情形，這應與 Type 2 具有較高的幫浦
效能有關。

2.6 布朗運動生醫檢測技術 
一般而言，當粒徑小於 1μm 以下時，
布朗運動的效應就會越來越顯著。在生醫
蛋白質檢測方面，抗原抗體結合檢測方式
是目前最熱門的研究方向，其常用之方式
乃是在金膜上接種上抗體之後，利用抗體
之專一性去抓取溶液中特定的抗原，通常
是利用螢光強度來顯示鍵結的狀況。抗原
與抗體鍵結點之結合力的大小稱為親和
力；而親留力則是指抗體和抗原間之有效
結合力之大小，係由抗原決定位與抗體結
合區間親和力之大小與彼此間之結合價位
所決定。當抗體接在球體上時，有效結合
力會比接合在基材表面增加了一萬倍左
右，如此一來可以增加鍵結的效率，應用
於檢測上亦能提高其晶片之靈敏度。 
本研究結合了布朗運動與圓球上鍵結
親留力提升的概念，預期將布朗運動的效
應與生物感測器搭起一座橋樑，由於奈米
球結合上分子物質後，在微觀下粒徑的變
化會影響到布朗運動的程度，希望透過速
度之變化的關係來判斷抗原抗體結合之效
應，另外也能透過疾病所產生的專一抗體
來抓取特定抗原，做為一個以布朗運動學
理為基礎之生物感測晶片，並利用光學量
測之方式做為即時檢測的機制。本實驗室
使用 μ-PIV 量測生物粒子之布朗運動現
象，如圖 11 所示。並可經由布朗運動現象

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the sensing principle for measuring the nanobeads’
Brownian velocities.
ciation constant was signiﬁcantly increased from 104 to 1010. As a
result, rapid real-time detection can be achieved with ease.
In this study, the ﬂuorescent nanobeads with diameters of
300nm were used to detect various concentrations of CRPs by
using micro-particle tracking velocimetry (micro-PTV). Variations
in every nanobead’s Brownian velocity were recorded during the
interaction process. Based on the sizes of CRPs and anti-CRPs
mentioned previously, the nanobeads’ diameters are estimated
to increase 17.5% after conjugating with CRPs. The experimen-
tal results, measured by micro-PTV, were analyzed statistically to
obtain the relationship between the Brownian velocity and the
CRP concentration. Moreover, based on kinetic analysis model, the
binding constants were determined.
2. Materials and experimental methods
2.1. Preparation of the nanobeads
Nanobeads (MerckTM XC030) with an optimal excitation and
emission wavelengths of 475 and 525nm, respectively, were used
in the experiments. The speciﬁc gravities of the beadswere approx-
imately 1.05g/cm3, with weak negative charges being carried onto
the surface due to the carboxyl group (COOH−). Fig. 2 illustrates
the procedures for preparing the nanobeads with conjugated anti-
bodies. Nanobeads in a latex suspension state (10ml) were diluted
with a 2-(n-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer. MES
buffer with a pH value of 5.5 is an activation buffer and was used
to eliminate the clustering of the nanobeads. The nanobeads were
then washed with MES buffer using ultrasonics followed by collec-
tion on the ﬁlter paper. In order to covalently bond the anti-CRPs
onto the nanobeads surface, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide (EDC) (50mg) was freshly dissolved in the water. In
addition, the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was also diluted in the
buffer to prevent the EDC from hydrolysis. The latex suspension
with nanobeads was incubated with the EDC solution for 15min.
The free and modiﬁed nanobeads were then separated from the
mixture and collected by the ﬁlter paper. EDC-NHS functionization
was used to covalently (NH2–COOH) link nanobeads to antibody
following a well-known protocol (Rocha et al., 2002; Cao et al.,
2006).
These beads collected by ﬁlter paper were washed again with
phosphatebuffered saline (PBS)buffer, pH7.2 (couplingbuffer), fol-
lowed by suspension in the same buffer with a volume of 5ml. The
solution was then mixed with an equal volume of anti-CRPs (with
5mg/ml). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 4h
with uniform shaking. The carboxyl groups on the beads, which
were not conjugatedwith antibodymolecules, were blocked by the
quenchingbuffer for30min.After the surplus carboxyl groupswere
blocked, the nanobeadswerewashedwith distilledwater and then
re-dissolved in the distilled water (Rocha et al., 2002). The distilled
water does not include any electrolyte and therefore can reduce a
sediment deposition of beads on the glass.
2.2. Fabrication of the micro-chambers
Micro-chambers containing the buffer solution were fabricated
using a simple MEMS technique. The photoresist, SU-8, was spun
on a silicon wafer, and the patterns of the chambers were obtained
after a photolithography process. The molds of the chambers were
manufactured by a 120 ◦C baking procedure. PDMS (polydimethyl-
siloxane) was subsequently poured into the mold and baked at
100 ◦C for 2h to obtain the micro-chambers. The depth and the
diameter of the micro-chambers were 50m and 12mm, respec-
tively. This PDMS chamber was then covered with a glass after the
chamber was ﬁlled with the buffer solution. Aberration could then
be eliminated when the object lens was used to collect ﬂuorescent
emissions via the glass.
2.3. Micro-PTV setup
A micro-PTV system was used to measure the Brownian veloc-
ities of the nanobeads in real-time. Fig. 3 exhibits the schematic
diagramof the experimental arrangement. An invertedmicroscope
equipped with ﬂuorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) ﬁlter cube was
used to collect the emission lights from the ﬂuorescent nanobeads
in epi-ﬂuorescent mode. The set of FITC ﬁlter cube includes an
exciter, a dichroic mirror, and an emitter. Hence, from themercury
lamp, a blue excitation light can be obtained behind the exciter. The
dichroic mirror reﬂected the excitation light while only the emis-
sion light could be allowed to transmit. To reduce the background
noise, emissions from the ﬂuorescent nanobeads were further ﬁl-
tered by the emitter. A high-sensitivity CCD (1600×1200pixels)
mounted on the microscope was used to receive the ﬂuores-
cent emissions via an object lens, which had a magniﬁcation of
20X and a numerical aperture of 0.75, and a depth of ﬁeld of
∼1.2m.
To evaluate the displacements of the nanobeads, the images
were acquired in pairs in a particular time-interval. The time inter-
val between the two frames of the image pair was 33.3ms. In
addition, the exposure time of the CCD camera was 5.72ms. The
temperature of the chamber was maintained at 295±1K and was
monitored by a thermocouple. The sampling nanobeads for the
measurement were in the central plane of the micro-chamber so
that Brownian diffusivemotion hindered by the near-wall could be
neglected (Kihm et al., 2004). The position, diameter, and intensity
of each nanobead were extracted from the images by chosen val-
ues of particle minimum size (pixels) and particle peak intensity
threshold. The Brownian velocity of each nanobead was evalu-
ated using particle tracking algorithm which will be described in
the following paragraph. Statistical results, calculated from 30 pair
images,were used to obtain the distribution of the Brownian veloc-
ities of the nanobeads. Moreover, 1200 image pairs were acquired
and analyzed for a period of 10min to obtain the variations in the
Brownian velocities.
The classical algorithms for PTV were implemented by using
four-frame in-line trackingmethod (Kobayashi et al., 1989; Hassan

associated with an equipartition of energy, (1/2)mx˙2 is equal to
1/2kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant, k=1.3805×10−23 J/K, T
is the absolute temperature of the ﬂuid. By multiplying both sides
of Eq. (1), and take the ensemble average of all terms, Eq. (1) can be
rewritten and solved as:

in which the initial condition is x(0) = x˙(0) = 0. If the particle is a
sphere,  is given by  =3dp from Stokes’ law, where  is the
viscosity of the solvent, and dp is the diameter of the particle.
In order to determine the relation between the diffusion coef-
ﬁcient and the mean displacement, this study uses the diffusion
equation to describe the processes exhibiting Brownian diffusive
behavior,
∂n
∂t
= D∇2n (4)
In one-dimensional case, n(x, t) is the density of the diffusing
material at location x and time t. D is the bulk diffusion coefﬁcient
for density n at location x. In Eq. (4), the initial condition can be
given as delta function and Eq. (4) gives
n(x, t) = N

The results indicate that the particle density distribution of the
diffusion equation is aGaussian distribution in Eq. (5), and the stan-
dard deviation  of the particle density distribution can be given
by comparing the formula with Gaussian function as:
 =
√
2Dt (7)
The relation between the mean displacement of the Brownian
motion and the standard deviation of the distribution can be found
to be  =
√
x2.
Moreover, from Eq. (6), the diffusive velocity Vd of the particle
can be deﬁned as follows:
Vd =
√
2D
t
(8)
Hence, Eqs. (3) and (6) give the diffusion coefﬁcient:
D = kT
3dp
(9)
For a particular solution at constant temperature, diffusive
velocity only depends on the size of the particle. In practice, the
probability density function of nanobeads’ Brownian velocities
followed Gaussian distribution. Therefore, the diffusive velocities
are equal to the standard deviation of the nanobeads’ Brownian
velocities, V from Eqs. (7) and (8). Moreover, a higher standard
deviation of the diffusive velocities can be expected from the
smaller-sized nanobeads. The relationship between V and the size
of nanobeads is useful in developing a kinetic model of this sensing
technique.
3.2. Kinetic model analysis
An anti-CRP is a kind of immunoglobulin G (IgG) that has two
identical combining sites which conjugate two antigen molecules.
In this situation, the interaction of antibody and antigenwas statis-
tically analyzed by Klotz et al. (1953) and Delisi (1983). Moreover,
a kinetic analysis of anti-CRP and CRP interaction in homogeneous
solutions has been published under the assumptions that the two
epitopes of anti-CRPs are equivalent and have no inﬂuence on each
other (Lin et al., 2005). The dissociation constant (KD) of CRP-anti-
CRP interaction has thus been determined as follows:
Agbulk
km

km
Agsurface + Ab
ka

kd
AgAb (10)
where km is the rate constant for mass (Agbulk) transport to and
from the surface (Agsurface), ka and kd are the association rate con-
stant and the dissociation rate constant for antigen (Ag) binding
with antibody (Ab).
In the present experiment, anti-CRPs were immobilized on the
surface of the nanobeads, and were then mixed with CRPs. These

Fig. 6. (A) Real-time variations of Brownian velocities with respect to four con-
centrations (0, 0.1, 5, 100g/ml) of CRPs during the binding processes for 300nm
nanobeads. (B)At equilibriumstates, the standarddeviationof thenanobeads’ Brow-
nian velocities V and the evaluated nanobeads’ diameters with respect to different

decreased from 4.50 to 4.02m/s when the CRP concentration
increased from 0 to 100g/ml. Therefore, when in the equilibrium
state, as the concentration of CRP increased, the V value became
smaller and the average diameter of nanobeads became bigger.
This experiment used purewater as the antibody–antigen inter-
action reacting solution, the limit of detectable concentration was
observed tobe0.1g/mlwhenusing300nmnanobeads. Regarding
to the clinical samples, either blood or serum, since these ﬂuids are
more viscous than pure water, the limit of detection could become
higher than that found in this work according to Eq. (9). However,
the limit of detection can be further improved if micro-PTV can
accurately track the nanobeads which are smaller than 300nm.
From the results given in Fig. 6(A), during the reactionprocesses,
the nanobeads’ volumes increased with time with respect to vari-
ous CRP concentrations as depicted in Fig. 6(C). By using Eqs. (12)
and (13) and the data of Fig. 6(C), the values of ka and kd were
derived. From our experimental results, ka and kd were found to
be 1.56×104 M−1 s−1 and 1.17×10−2 s−1, respectively. Therefore,
the corresponding dissociation constant KD is 7.54×10−7 M. In ﬁve
determinations, an average KD, i.e. an average stoichiometry of
(6.48±1.43)×10−7 was obtained. The signiﬁcance of changes in
KD is due to temperature ﬂuctuations. From Eq. (8), the diffusion
coefﬁcient mainly depends on the particle size, the temperature
and the viscosity of the solution. Although we assume a constant
chamber temperature, temperature variations were monitored by
a thermocouple.
The current result for the dissociation constant is close
to those reported in the literature. For instance, the KD was
evaluated as 4.47±0.32×10−7 M by enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (ELISA, Friguet et al., 1985; Lin et al., 2006b), and
5.53±0.48×10−7 M by the method of dual-polarization interfer-
ometry (DPI, Lin et al., 2006a). The agreement shows that the
present technique possesses good sensing capabilities. The present
technique is comparedwith othermeasurement techniques,which
were used to determine the dissociation constant of CRP and
anti-CRP reported above. This Brownian motion measurement
technique provides a quantitative information to a diagnosis in
CRP concentration detection with quick processing, low price, and
real-time detection as compared with DPI and ELISA. Similarly, DPI
provides information to a solution in terms of molecule deposition
thickness and density on a speciﬁc substrate with quickly pro-
cess and real-time detection. However, it also costs more than that
of Brownian motion measurement for bio-molecules detection on
facilities and detection chips (Cross et al., 2003). It has been know
that ELISA has been widely used as a diagnostic tool in medicine
and plant pathology, as well as a quality control check in various
industries. However, it could not be used tomonitor a reaction and
simultaneously obtain the quantitative information.
5. Conclusions
In this study, a novel bio-sensing technique using a micro-PTV
has been successfully developed to measure the antigen–antibody
(CRP-anti-CRP) interaction in pure water. Results of the real-time
reactions showed that the nanobeads’ diameters increased during
the binding process, so that the standard deviation of the Brownian
velocities decreased with time. Moreover, higher CRP concentra-
tion led to lower standard deviation of Brownian velocities in the
equilibrium state. Measurement results clearly demonstrated that
the current technique has high sensitivity even at a very low con-
centration of CRP, 0.1g/ml. Based on the relationship between
the variations of nanobeads’ sizes and CRP concentration, a mod-
iﬁed kinetic model was proposed to evaluate the association rate
constant, the dissociation rate constant, and the dissociation con-
stant. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by
ELISA and DPI. This simple and sensitive sensing technique can
be used to detect other antigens and pathogenic viruses and has
great potential to be integrated into a portable micro-bio-system
for home healthcare.

Abstract A microfluidic flow-converter that transforms
an oscillatory flow into a steady-like flow in a reciprocat-
ing-type pumping device is successfully developed in this
study. The flow quality at the outlet is found to be signif-
icantly improved. The present micro-device is composed of
two single-chamber PZT micropumps in parallel arrange-
ment and can be fabricated using simple micro-electro-
mechanical-system (MEMS) techniques. Based on the
concept of the electronic bridge converter, the flow recti-
fication is supported by four passive planar valves. Two
operation modes, in-phase and anti-phase, were used to test
the performance of the present device. In addition, the flow
characteristics at the outlet were examined by an externally
triggered micro-PIV system. The results reveal that the
current flow-converter provided both high volume and
smoothly continuous flow rates at the outlet when it was in
anti-phase mode. Moreover, the volume flow rate was
linearly proportional to the excitation frequency within a
specific frequency regime. This indicates that the flow-
converter was easily operated and controlled. The present
microfluidic flow-converter has great potential for inte-
gration into future portable micro- or bio-fluidic systems.

1 Introduction
Numerous researches on micropumps, which include
developments and analyses, have been proposed in the past
30 years and widely introduced by the review papers.
Based on the driving sources, a micropump can be classi-
fied as either a displacement type or a dynamic type (Laser
and Santiago 2004). On the other hand, a micropump can
also be called either a reciprocating type or a continuous
flow type if the classification is made according to the flow
behaviors (Woias 2005). Recently, a more detailed classi-
fication of micropumps is also made according to the
actuating principles and valve types (Iverson and Garimella
2008). The characteristics of various types of micropumps
are compared and concluded in the review article. Most
micropumps are developed based on the actuating princi-
ples of the reciprocating type micropump since it was first
proposed in 1988 (van Lintel et al. 1988). A typical
reciprocating micropump can be divided into two compo-
nents: a chamber and two flow rectifiers.
The pumping chamber can be easily deformed by
applying external driving sources such as PZT plates (Feng
and Kim 2004), electromagnetic forces (Jeong and Yang
2000; Yamahata et al. 2005a, b), or thermopneumatic or
pneumatic deformations (Sim et al. 2003; Huang et al.
2006). These forces vary within a time period due to the
employment of AC driving signals, which lead to the
pumping chambers have regular volume changes. There-
fore, reciprocating flows exist in the microchannels.
The other component, flow rectifiers, which also plays an
important role in directing flow can easily be classified as
either valve type or valveless type. Rectifiers in a valve type
can have high efficiency to block a reverse flow. Most valve-
type rectifiers such as the cantilever valve (Zengerle et al.
1995; Koch et al. 1997; Loverich et al. 2007), ball valve

volume chamber. During this, the upstream planar valve is
opened while the downstream planar valve is closed.
Therefore, the increase of fluid volume in the chamber is
then mainly provided by the inlet. On the other hand, fluids
are pumped out from the chamber due to the increasing
pressure in the compressed volume at the pump phase. The
pumped flow results in a switch-off and a switch-on of the
upstream and downstream valves, respectively. Hence, the
flow can only move toward the outlet, and thus, after an
operating cycle, a net flow is obtained.
More factors need to be considered when two single-
chamber micropumps work in parallel. Figure 2 illustrates
the operating modes of the present double-chamber mi-
cropump, with in-phase and anti-phase modes. When a
micropump is operated in in-phase mode, its two chambers
are at supply and pump phases at the same time. On the
other hand, a phase difference of 180 exists between the
driving voltages for two PZT plates in anti-phase mode.
The velocities of the oscillatory flows at the outlet are the
sums of those pumped out from chambers A and B.
Therefore, the oscillatory flow at the outlet is amplified
when the micropump is operated in in-phase mode.
Reduced amplitude, on the other hand, is obtained in the
anti-phase mode, where a smoother flow rate is expected
compared to the in-phase mode.
The fabrication process of the moving part and the
device for the micropump is not complicated. Two single-
polished silicon wafers ‹111›, both with a thickness of
150 lm, were used to fabricate the main device of the
micropump and the moving parts of the valves. The silicon
wafer for the manufacture of moving parts was etched in
the first step in order to remove the superfluous thickness of
80 lm. The thickness of the moving part was therefore
70 lm. An inductive couple plasma (ICP) etcher was
employed to anisotropically etch the structures on the
wafer. The photoresist, AZ-P4620, was then used to protect
the patterns during the etching process and was removed by
the O2 plasma after the moving parts were released from
the dummy wafer. The volume and mass of the moving
parts are estimated to be 5.9 9 10-3 mm3 and 13.6 lg,
respectively. The process was used again to fabricate the
main device of the micropump. The channels that connect
the inlet and the outlet are 300 lm in width and 80 lm in
depth. The silicon wafer was covered with a 500 lm
thickness Pyrex 7740 glass plate with anodic bonding after
the moving parts were manually placed in the channels.
The PZT plates, with a diameter of 8 mm and thickness of
200 lm, were attached to the silicon surface of the
chamber with a thin layer of expoxy. The piezoelectric
strain constants, d31 and d33 values of the PZT, were
190 9 10-12 and 420 9 10-12 C/N, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 1a, two holes were made at both the inlet and
the outlet. Two glass tubes with an inner diameter of
1.15 mm were then connected, one to the inlet and the
other to the outlet.
2.2 Measurements
Depleted ion water was served as the testing fluid to pre-
liminarily measure the pumping performance of the
experiment. A digital camcoder was used to record the
variations of liquid levels in the glass tubes which were
connected to the inlet and the outlet, respectively, in the
vertical direction. The variations of the liquid levels were
then evaluated to obtain the volume flow rates. Moreover, a
micro-PIV system was employed to further investigate the
transient flow fields within a time period for both in-phase
and anti-phase modes. The principles are similar to tradi-
tional PIVs, but the illumination of the light sheet is
replaced by other optical systems (Santiago et al. 1998).
Flow motions were obtained by recording the displace-
ments of the fluorescent particles seeded in the fluids. For
most micro-PIV systems, the sampling rate, which ranges
from several Hz to tens of Hz, is enough for steady flow
measurements. Based on the Shannon-Nyquist theorem,
this sampling rate cannot provide enough time resolution to
analyze a high-frequency oscillatory flow motion with
hundreds to thousands of Hz. Therefore, a micro-PIV
measurement system with an externally triggered technique
was used in our experiments. This technique has been
previously employed to investigate unsteady flow fields in
micromixers and microseparators (Sheen et al. 2007; Lee
et al. 2007).

mentation arrangement. The characteristics of phase-
dependent flow fields were observed using a NikonTM

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Pumping performance
Five different excitation voltages 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 V-
were used to drive the PZT plates in both in-phase and anti-
phase modes. Figure 4 reveals the pumping flow rates at 10,
20, and 30 V (the results for 15 and 25 V are not shown
here). The black filled diamond and the blue open diamond
symbols, respectively represent the flow rates measured in
the in-phase and anti-phase modes. Moreover, the volume
flow rates pumped by single chambers A (green filled circle)
and B (red open circle) were also measured at the higher
voltages of 20 and 30 V, as shown in Fig. 4b and c,
respectively. The results clearly indicate that a wider range
of frequencies were observed when the micropump was
operated in the anti-phase mode than in the in-phase mode.
The optimum frequencies of in-phase and anti-phase oper-
ations are at 0.5 and 0.7 kHz, respectively. The results also
showed that the volume flow rates pumped by only one
chamber, either A or B, were in good agreement with each
other. In addition, Fig. 4b and c also indicate that the flow
rates provided by single-chamber operations approximately
amounted to half of those measured in the in-phase mode.
The errors of the volume flow rates in the experiment were
estimated according to the equation given as follows.

where Q

; R, dh, and t are respectively the volume flow rate,
the radius of the glass tube, the variation of the liquid level,
and the time interval to record this variation. The mea-
surement errors of these quantities are indicated by placing
d before the corresponding symbols. From the experiment,
the errors of the measured volume flow rate were less than
8.5%.
Whether in in-phase or anti-phase mode, a linearly
increasing flow rate with an increasing frequency was
observed. For example, the linear regimes of in-phase and
anti-phase mode operations were measured at 0.1–0.4 kHz
and 0.1–0.5 kHz, respectively. These linear regimes made
the present micropump easy to operate and control, which
is very useful for a portable micro-TAS device. For
example, a specific flow rate can be obtained by adjusting
the excitation frequency to accord with the slopes of the
linear relationships. Therefore, the flow of the testing
sample for the sensing or mixing process in a micro bio-
chemical system can be easily provided by the present
Fig. 4 Volume flow rates in various operating modes at 10, 20, and
30 V (in-phase mode filled diamond, anti-phase mode open diamond,

the discussion of Fig. 6. When one chamber pumped the
flow toward the outlet, the other one performed a role of a
capacitor to draw in most of the flows. Compared to the
results in Fig. 7, the flow amplitudes at the outlet in the
anti-phase mode were much lower than those in the in-
phase mode. Moreover, two peaks of velocity amplitudes
in a positive direction at the lower frequencies of 0.1–
0.3 kHz were clearly observed within an operating cycle.
This result indicated that the oscillatory flows from the two
chambers were converted into a double-pulsating flow at
the outlet. When higher excitation frequencies, from 0.5 to
0.9 kHz, were used to drive the micropump, the output
flow became smoothly continuous. This result meant that
the oscillatory flow always transformed into a steady-like
flow toward the outlet at any given time. The flow moved
between chambers A and B whenever the frequency
climbed higher than 1.0 kHz. Figure 8f depicts the output
volume flow rate approaching 0 at 1.1 kHz.
In order to further quantify the performance of the
current micropump according to the flow field measure-
ment, the total flow diodicity of the two operation modes
needed to be evaluated based on the determination, which
is shown as follows:
g ¼ 1  Qr
Qf
ð3Þ
where Qf and Qr are respectively the forward and reversed
volume flows in the vertical central plane of the micro-
channel. These volume flows are evaluated according to the
integration of the phase-dependent velocities given in
Fig. 5 Sequential flow fields in the in-phase mode within a time period. The voltage and frequency were measured at 20 V and 0.5 kHz,
respectively

123
and QB at 0.1–0.8 kHz. The 60% loss during the flow-
converting process was mainly due to its capacitors, as
mentioned in the previous paragraph. Moreover, the results
also show that although the values of g still approximated 1
at 0.9 and 1.0 kHz, the value of w, however, rapidly
decreased at frequencies higher than 0.8 kHz. The results
measured at 0.1–0.5 kHz also show that the efficiency for
generating the net flow in in-phase mode was 10% higher.
However, the total flow-rectified capability in anti-phase
mode was almost twice that compared to in-phase mode.

Abstract The results of a study on a new type of PZT
valveless micropump with asymmetric obstacles are pre-
sented in this paper. The valveless micropump was made
through a MEMS fabrication process by using simply only
one photo mask. Asymmetric obstacles are used for the flow
directing device instead of the diffuser/nozzle elements used
in previous studies. In this study, numerical simulations were
also carried out to evaluate the design and the performance of
the new micropump. The main feature of the present
micropump is that it has a uniform cross-section area across
the micro-channel, which gives many advantages. The
differential pressure head and the pumping flow rate can be
adjusted easily by using obstacles of different shapes and
changing the PZT operating frequency without changing the
dimensions of the micro-channel. In this experiment, the
performance of the micropump was evaluated by measuring
the pressure head difference and the flow rate as the input
voltage ranged from 20 to 40 V, a range much lower than
those in previous studies. The pumping pressure can reach a
maximum of 1.2 kPa, and the maximum net volume flow rate
is 156 ll/min. These test data indicate that this micropump
fulfills the demands for most micro-fluidic systems. More-
over, the present device can be easily applied to complex
systems with combinations of several pumps and micro-
channels in the future.
1 Introduction
The development of micro-fluidic systems has been an area
of increasing interest in the field of MEMS and Bio-MEMS
in recent years. Micropumps are essential components of
micro-fluidic systems and bio-sensing systems. Valveless
micropumps, fabricated with MEMS techniques, are cheap
and powerful and are especially useful when the fluid
contains particles such as red blood cells, polymers or
proteins. A micromachined electro-hydrodynamic (EHD)
injection pump with no moveable parts was developed
(Richter et al. 1991). Only polar fluids could be used in this
pump, and a very high driving voltage (larger than hun-
dreds of volts) was necessary. The first valveless diffuser/
nozzle pump, replacing passive check valves as the flow
rectifying elements, was presented (Stemme and Stemme
1993). However, the design was machined in brass and had
rather larger device dimensions, with a chamber diameter
of 19 mm and a valve length of 3–4 mm. Dynamic passive
valves at inlet and outlet fabricated through anisotropic
etching in h100i silicon were first described (Gerlach and
Wurmus 1995).
Most microfluidic researchers rely on micro-
electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technologies to design
microflow devices or micro-total-analysis systems
(l-TAS). The use of MEMS processes, including HNA,
DRIE etching, and thermoplastic replication, in the fabri-
cation of valveless micropumps was proposed (Olsson
et al. 1996, 1998, 2000). In 2000, a magnetic membrane
valveless pump, consisting of a magnetic microactuator
and two polymer-based diffuser valves, was presented for
micro-fluidic systems (Khoo and Liu 2001). The actuation
principles that have been applied to PZT membrane
micropumps were proposed (Koch et al. 1998). The
performance enhancement analysis of the piezoelectric

is on the area of steady viscous flow, with no separation
and moderately good performance. The depth of the micro-
channel was 80 lm. It was fabricated by inductive couple
plasma (ICP) etching, and the neck area between the
side wall and the obstacle was 44 9 80 lm. Because the
unexpected effect is highly dependent on the inlet bound-
ary condition, the obstacles have rounded entrances with
radii of 30 lm and sharp outlets. The left and right
obstacles are placed 1,000 lm away from the inlet and exit
of the compression chamber. The diameter of the circular
vibrating chamber, D, is 6 mm. A picture of a valveless
micropump driven with asymmetric obstacles is provided
in Fig. 3, and the detailed dimensions of the obstacles and
the micro-channel are listed in Table 1.
3 Fabrication and experimental setup
The valveless micropump was fabricated in a 500 lm thick
silicon wafer using ICP etching. The main benefit of the
ICP etching technique is that it precisely controls any
arbitrary planar design of an asymmetric obstacle,
the rectangular cross section of micro-channels, and the
rounded inlet regions of the chamber. A photo of the
obstacles and chamber is shown in Fig. 4. In this study, all
obstacles were 80 lm deep, but the angles varied.
The most commonly used material for the actuation of a
micropump in a microsystem is probably PZT (Koch et al.
2000). A PZT disc with a thickness of 200 lm was placed
on the glass surface to provide the driving force, and two
asymmetric obstacles were placed upstream and down-
stream of the chamber, respectively. Before the compres-
sion chamber was filled with water, the displacement of the
PZT disc surface was directly measured with a microscopic
laser Doppler vibrometer (displacement error is 0.4% full
scale). The vibration amplitudes, d, of the PZT actuated
membrane were 0.1, 0.15, and 0.3 lm for driving voltages
of 20, 30, and 40 V, respectively. The micro-channel and
obstacles were fabricated on a silicon wafer by ICP etching
and anodic bonded with a sodium glass wafer (Corning
7740) with a thickness of 500 lm. The bonding was carried
out at a temperature of 400C when an external voltage in
the range of 400–800 V was applied. The fabrication
process of the valveless micropump is shown in Fig. 5. The
fabrication process of this study is simpler than those
reported in other studies (Olsson et al. 1996, 1998, 2000;
Khoo and Liu 2001) since only one photo mask, one ICP
etching step, and anodic glass bonding are required. Glass
tubes with an inside diameter of 1 mm were connected
vertically to the inlet and outlet exits for pressure hand and
net flow rate measurements. The fluid behaviors were
observed with a digital video recorder. The schematic
diagram of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 6.

For the numerical simulation, the length scales, as shown in
Table 1, are of orders of tens of microns or higher. The

head of 1.2 kPa were obtained

where R is the radius of the outlet tube. The duration time,
t, was measured when an increment of height difference dh
reached 1 mm from initial pumping. Figure 7 demonstrates
the effect of frequency on the net flow rate for the case with
different inclined angles (a = 7, 3.5). The pressure head
versus applied frequencies with the Type I and Type II
micropumps are shown in Fig. 7a and b. Compare this
with the different driving voltages in Type I. At 40 V, the
maximum pressure head is 1.2 kPa, which is 9 times that of
20 V, but only 1.7 times that of 30 V. In the same range
of voltage, the maximum pressure head is 36 times and 3
times in Type II, respectively. The performances of dif-
ferent pumps will be enhanced to various levels with dif-
ferent voltages. Moreover, at input voltages of 20, 30, and
40 V, the maximum pressure heads of the Type I pump are
13, 6, and 3 times greater than those of the Type II. The
results clearly indicate that the performance of the Type I
micropump is better than that of the Type II pump. The
result is in accordance with the transitory stall pattern with
strongly unsteady flow presented (Fox and Kline 1962).
The experimental results of net flow rate with various
operating frequencies are shown in Fig. 8a and b. The
results also clearly show that the performance of the Type I
is better. At 40 V, the net flow rate is 156 ll/min, which is
12.5 times that of 20 V, but only 3.3 times that of 30 V. In
the same range of voltage, the net flow rates are 15.6 times
and 2.6 times in Type II, respectively. At input voltages of
20, 30, and 40 V, the maximum flow rates of the Type I
pump are 17, 11, and 14 times greater than those of the
Type II. At 40 V, the net flow rate of water could be raised
to 156 ll/min in Type I. The amplitude of the PZT disc

From the present results, we have determined the
method to control the pressure head and net flow rate in a
single micropump by different driving voltages and oper-
ating frequencies. These results are useful in developing
this micropump to cooperate with other devices in the
micro-system.

6 Conclusions
This paper reports the development of a new type PZT
valveless micropump with a novel design using asym-
metric obstacles. The present micropump can be fabri-
cated by a MEMS process which requires only one photo
mask and one ICP etching process. The performance of
the present micropump depends not only on the geo-
metric parameters of its asymmetric obstacles but also on
the vibration frequencies of the PZT disc. With water
used as the testing fluid, the maximum pumping pressure
that the micropump can attain is 1.2 kPa at 3.1 kHz, and
the maximum net volume flow rate is 156 ll/min. The
performance of the pump, the net flow rate and the
pumping pressure, can be demonstrated through unsteady
three-dimensional computation. The results of the
numerical simulation agree fairly with those of the
experiments.
The present PZT micropump has many advantages
compared to those in previous studies. Lower pressure loss
than in the others can be obtained. The driving voltage is
lowered to 20 V. Furthermore, the performance of the
present micropump is found to be able to fulfill the
demands of most micro-fluidic or Bio-MEMS systems. The
pressure head and net flow rate can be adjusted by using
different shapes for the obstacles and changing the
vibrating frequency of the PZT disc without changing the
dimensions of the channel. Moreover, the rectangular
straight micro-channel in the micropump has a uniform
cross-section area. With this design, it is easy to combine
the pump with other micro-fluidic elements and to have a
series pumps connected.

Abstract In this paper, a PZT micropump excited by
amplified squarewave signals with various frequencies was
used to study the transient flow behaviors in an obstacle-
type valveless micropump. A micro-particle-image-veloc-
imetry (micro-PIV) with an external trigger was developed
to obtain flow fields at the outlet and around the obstacle
with various phases in a cycle. In comparison with previous
studies on the pump performance, such as pump pressure
and volume flow rate, more detailed information about the
pump was obtained. The velocity profiles and periodic
sectional mean velocities exhibited the unsteady flow nat-
ure. The total net flow generation efficiency per cycle was
obtained experimentally by integrating the phase-depen-
dent velocities. The flow recirculation around the obstacle
was observed and quantified to investigate the influence on
the pump performance. The duration, circulation, and the
size of the recirculation regions indicated that this flow
behavior could enhance the flow-directing capability.
These results are very useful for the design and improve-
ment of obstacle-type valveless micropumps.

to harmonic pressure gradients in a macroscale circular
pipe (Womersley 1955; Uchida 1956) and a rectangular
duct (Fan and Chao 1965) are derived from the Navier–
Stokes equations. For an oscillatory flow, the pressure
gradient is only a function of time and is usually expressed
in the form of the Fourier series or Euler formula. From the
momentum equation, the velocity which is a function of
position and time is derived based on the time-dependent
pressure gradient. Therefore, a phase-lag may exist
between the flow velocity and the pressure gradient. In
order to compare the transient initial force to the viscous
force, one dimensionless parameter, Womersley number
(Wo), is used to qualitatively identify quasi-steady flow
behavior (Loudon and Tordesilla 1998).
Wo ¼ r

ð4Þ
A quasi-steady flow is a flow in which the flow rate keeps
up with a rapidly changing pressure gradient and is ob-
served for Wo < 1. However, the phase-lag between the
flow velocity and the pressure gradient can be observed
when Wo is larger than 1. In addition, the velocity profile is
different from that of a steady flow for Wo >> 1. For
instance, parabolic-shape velocity profile no longer exists
when the flow oscillates in a circular tube with Wo = 10
(Uchida 1956). The maximum velocity at the profile no
longer occurs in the central region but in the region close to
the channel wall. In a recent study, these unsteady flow
natures in microchannels are also investigated numerically
by using molecular dynamic simulation with different
temperatures and densities (Hansen and Ottesen 2006).
1.3 Motivations and objectives
Pump pressures and volume flow rates are the most com-
monly used indices to describe the global performances in
the literature (Olsson et al. 1995; Ullmann 1998; Gamboa
et al. 2006). The flow fields around the valveless flow
rectifiers, which carry useful information for pump design,
have been investigated only in numerical simulations. The
objective of the present paper is thus to provide experi-
mentally measured flow field so that the actual pump
characteristics may be assessed. A micro-PIV (micro-Par-
ticle-Image-Velocimetry) is employed for 2D full-field
flow measurements. This technique has been widely uti-
lized since it is proposed in 1998 (Santiago et al. 1998).
For example, the measurements of blood flow (Park et al.

A test micropump was mounted on an experiment
holder which kept the focal plane and the chip in parallel.
A double-channel function generator (HPTM) provided the
excitation and the trigger signals which were corrected
with a reference phase. The square wave excitation sig-
nals amplified by a power amplifier were used to drive the
PZT plate. The conditions of amplified voltages adopted
here were 15–40 V (peak to peak) with frequencies
ranging from 0.1 to 5 kHz. Moreover, the trigger signals,
which were adjusted to a specified constant time delay
with respect to the driving sources, were transmitted to a
synchronizer via a cable. The synchronizer was used as a
timing and control module in the micro-PIV system. The
time solution of the synchronizer is 10–9 s, which is much
shorter than 0.001% of the cycling period. The flow was
illuminated by the laser pulses and the image pairs ac-
quired by the CCD were processed in quick order right
after the synchronizer received the externally triggered
signals. One hundred pairs of images (frame A and frame
B) were acquired and processed for each particular phase
to raise the signal to noise ratio. The flow fields measured
in the plane at the central depth of channel were used to
calculate the velocity vectors by cross-correlation algo-
rithm with Nyquist condition. Two regions, at the outlet
and around the first obstacle, were chosen to measure the
flow velocities. A digital camcorder was used to monitor
the variations of flow rate and pump pressure. The
arrangements of the instruments and the measuring re-
gions are given in Fig. 2.
The interrogation window size chosen here was 16 ·
16 pixels. According to the Nyquist condition, the in-plane
vector resolution was determined as 6.8 lm · 6.8 lm. The
out-of-plane spatial resolution, or the depth-of-correlation,
is related to light diffraction, optical geometry of device,
and particle sizes (Meinhart et al. 2000).

While dzo was estimated to be 9.5 lm, that is, 19% of the
microchannel depth in the experiments. Although the 20 X
object lens cannot provide high resolution in the out-of-
plane direction due to the optical limitation, the larger view
field still exhibited the global flow characteristics near the
central plane.
In order to obtain the correct flow fields, the particle
sizes and the particle dynamics should be considered
(Devasenathipathy et al. 2003). The particle sizes used
here were less than 1% of the hydraulic diameter of the
channel. Moreover, the response time of the tracer particles
should be far shorter than the cycling period. Based on a
simple first-order inertial response to a constant flow, the
equation of particle response time can be expressed as
tr ¼

The particle density and the dynamic viscosity of water are
1.05 g/cm3 and 1.002 · 10–3 N s/m2 (at 20C), respec-
tively. Therefore, the response time of a 700 nm polymer
particle is less than 10–7 s.
Brownian motion, which is a temperature-dependent
random motion, in a two-dimensional measurement was
also considered as follows

where the subscript i indicates the x- or y-component. The
selection of time interval Dt between frame A and B was
varied according to the phase-dependent flow velocity in a
period. A longer time interval was chosen for lower
instantaneous flow velocity to reduce Brownian errors. For
instance, the minimum velocity occurred at the phase
switch and the time interval was set to be 200 ls. However,
a shorter interval, 5 ls, was required especially when the
maximum flow velocity appeared. A suitable adjustment of
time interval was important in the measurement because of
the instantaneous phase-dependent flow. The Brownian
error was thus controlled to be less than 1% for all results
in a cycle.
Fig. 2 Schematic diagrams of the instruments. The function gener-
ator provided both driving voltages and phase-locked trigger signals
to the power amplifier and the synchronizer, respectively. Micropump
was fixed on the holder and actuated by the amplified square-wave
voltages from the power amplifier. The actions of laser and CCD were
assigned by the synchronizer after receiving the externally triggered
signal with specific phase. All digital image pairs were stored in the
computer and used to evaluate velocity vectors. Two measuring

velocity) when –30 V was applied. The flow motions de-
cayed rapidly at the lowest excitation frequency of
0.1 kHz. The apparent flow velocities only appeared in the
downstream direction at the initial pump phase. However,
low flow velocities were also observed at the highest
excitation frequency of 5 kHz, which might be caused by
the increasing flow impedance.
Higher velocities appeared within the actuated fre-
quency range between 1 and 3 kHz. The maximum
velocity was obtained for 1.9 kHz, which was almost twice
as large as those for 1 and 3 kHz. Although the variation of
pressure gradient in the pump was not measured in this
experiment, the phase-shifts of the velocity amplitudes
were expected as the frequency increased. The velocity
amplitudes in the pump phase were slightly higher than
those in the supply phase, i.e. more volume of flow was
transported toward the downstream direction. The direction
of the net flow velocity in a cycle was verified by summing
the phase-dependent velocities.
Figure 6a shows the pump and supply phase mean flow
velocities obtained from the integrated results in Fig. 5.
The ratios of pump/supply phase (downstream/upstream)
flow velocities per cycle, go, indicated the global flow-
rectified performances of the obstacle-type micropump.
The results show that the maximum go, 1.12, was at the
frequency of 1.9 kHz. The comparison of the net flow
velocities by two different measuring methods are given in
Fig. 6b. The results obtained by micro-PIV measurement
were in good agreement with those by evaluating the net
flow rate in the glass tube.
The velocity fields were also affected by the excitation
frequencies. Table 1 lists Wo numbers for the chosen fre-
quencies based on the hydraulic radius of the microchan-
nel. The dimensionless velocity profiles in x–y plane at the
outlet with frequencies of 1, 1.9, and 3 kHz are illustrated
in Fig. 7. For this unsteady flow experiment, the maximum
velocity no longer appeared in the central region, but close
to the side-wall. The time-dependent distributions consis-
tently show a decrease of velocity from the boundary layer
to the central region. These phenomena were apparently
observed when the pump and supply phases were switched.
The velocity profiles also revealed the phase-shift manner
when the frequency was increased to 3 kHz. Although the
velocity profiles in the out-of-plane direction were not

lower velocities were in the central region. Flow recircu-
lation was generated due to the significant velocity gradient
and was clearly exhibited by the streamtrace. The recir-
culation disappeared soon after and the flow became
smooth when the fluids were accelerated at t = 0 T as given
in Fig. 8b.
As t was increased, the pump phase smooth flow patterns
remained qualitatively unchanged from 0 to 2/32T. How-
ever, flow recirculation emanated at x/Yo = 0.45, y/
Yo = ±0.3 and was observed at 4/32 T in Fig. 8c. The upper
fluids rotated counterclockwise, whereas the lower fluids
rotated clockwise. A recirculation zone was generated and
then enlarged gradually in the latter half period of the pump
phase. A recirculation bubble formed at 8/32 T and the size
of recirculation bubble increased during the interval be-
tween 10/32 and 14/32 T as depicted in Fig. 8d–h. Two
pairs of flow recirculation zones, a primary one and a sec-
ondary one, appeared and the vorticity in the secondary
recirculation zones was opposite to the primary one. At the
next phase as shown in Fig. 8i, the flow penetrated the re-

Figure 10b, c shows the circulation and area of the re-
circulation regions, which are in agreement with the flow
patterns in Figs. 8 and 9. The solid symbols represents the
circulation and size of recirculation regions caused by the
reversed flow upstream the obstacle, while the hollow ones
indicate the results downstream. The experimental results
also indicated that the strength and size of the recirculation
region were dependent on the excitation frequency. When
the pump was actuated at the optimal frequency, the fluids
had the largest kinetic energy. Although the kinetic energy
was dissipated by the viscous force, the fluids near the
recirculation region were disturbed so that the strength and
size were increased with increasing time. In summary the
flow recirculation became more pronounced when a flow
with a higher velocity moved through a sudden expansion
with a higher area ratio. This effect led to stronger rotation
and larger size upstream the obstacle where the reversed
flow moved through the throat at the optimal frequency. A
large-scale recirculation region can also be attained by
increasing the excitation voltage.
In the present experiment, no clear relationship was
found between these properties and the related Re numbers.
For example, the maximum circulation and the size of the
recirculation at the optimal frequency appeared at t = 14/
32 T while the highest Re number was 114.1 at t = 10/
32 T. However, these results revealed that the pressure drag
caused by the flow recirculation could not be neglected
when the fluids flowed through the rectifier. Higher pres-
sure drop of the flow would result in larger recirculation
region. Therefore, the reversed flow had more pressure
drag than the forward one. This phenomenon was favorable
to flow-directing capability of this obstacle-type flow rec-
tifier. The same flow behaviors were also observed around
the second obstacle, which were half-period phase shift
with respect to those around the first one.
The aforementioned results showed that not only the
diffuser element but also the flow recirculation had influ-
ences on the direction-dependent flow resistance. In order
to reduce the flow resistance caused by the recirculation of
the forward flow, the trapezoid obstacle can be replaced by
a triangular one. In a further study, this technique will be
used to investigate the flow resistance and the efficiency of
net flow generation for various geometry designs of the
obstacles in order to optimize the pump performance.
4 Conclusions
An externally triggered micro-PIV system was successfully
used to measure the full-field flow in an obstacle-type PZT
valveless micropump. The nature of the high-frequency
periodic unsteady flow was clearly explored in this
experiment. The quantitative measurements provide sig-
nificant insights into the flow behaviors, which are critical
for the improvement of the performance of the micropump.
Based on the test cases presented, the following conclu-
sions may be drawn:
(1) The pump could only be actuated within a certain
excitation frequency range from 1 to 3 kHz. The
maximum output volume flow rate appeared at the
resonance frequency of 1.9 kHz, at which the highest
instantaneous velocity was also measured.
(2) The phase-shifts between the sectional mean veloci-
ties and the excitation voltages were obtained when
Wo > 1. In addition, due to the high-frequency
oscillating flows, the annular-shape velocity profiles
were found to exist in both the x–y and x–z planes.
(3) The instantaneous flow velocities in the pump and the
supply phases were one or two order higher than the
net flow velocity. The ratio of pump/supply phases

ABSTRACT 
In this paper, a simply designed reciprocating-type 
micropump is presented. We also report the coupling effects 
between the valve motion and the flow behaviors, which were 
studied using a micro-PIV technique. The fluids were easily 
driven by a PZT plate and net flow was directed toward the 
outlet after rectification by two planar passive valves.  
The results revealed that good pumping performance was 
obtained even at a low excitation voltage of 10V. The optimum 
flow rate was measured at a frequency of 0.8kHz and the 
maximum flow rate was 275l/min at 30V. The micropump 
was uniquely characterized by the existence of a linear 
relationship between the flow rate and the driving frequency, 
which enabled this micropump to be easily operated and 
controlled. The experimental results showed that the 
micropump was reliable in terms of the high linearity and 
repeatability, which is very favorable for the portable 
microfluidic systems. 
The micro-PIV measurements of the transient motions of 
the valve and the flow behaviors clearly revealed that the valve 
efficiency depended on the mass inertia of the moving part, 
excitation frequency, and voltage. The present results are useful 
for the optimum design of this planar passive valve to improve 
the pumping efficiency.

measurement, micro-PIV, linear operation regime 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Micropumps are essential to transport fluids or to 
deliver materials in microfluidic and biofluidic-based micro-
total-analysis-systems (micro-TAS). Many different types of 
micropumps have been developed by MEMS fabricating 
techniques and classified as either dynamic or displacement 
types based on the pumping principles by Laser (2004). 
They can also be classified as either continuous flow or 
reciprocating flow types depending on the flow behaviors by 
Whias (2005).  
Displacement type micropumps drive fluids by the 
oscillating or rotating motions of the mechanical parts so 
that reciprocating flow fields are usually observed. The basic 
design concept of a reciprocatingly displacement micropump 
is attributable to van Lintel et al. (1988). A pump chamber is 
usually required to provide for volume variation when it is 
deformed by the electrostatic, piezoelectric, thermal-
pnenumatic, and magnetic actuating methods (Richter et al., 
1998; Jeong and Yang, 2000; Feng and Kin, 2004; Pan et al., 
2005). The forward and reversed flows appear alternately 
within a time period due to the vibration of the pumping 
chamber. Displacement type micropumps can be further 
devided into two groups according to the types of the flow 
rectifiers, i.e. valveless type or valve type. The valveless 
type rectifiers such as nozzle/diffuser element and Tesla-
type channels direct flows based on the direction-dependent 
resistance (Olsson et al., 2000; Ymahata et al., 2005; Morris 
and Forster, 2003; Izzo et al., 2007). This type of micro-
pump can be easily manufactured and its low flow diodicity 
has been experimentally confirmed in our previous study 
(Sheen et al., 2008).  
The flow rectifiers with valves provide high diodicity to 
block the reversed flow caused by the mechanical moving 
parts. For example, the flap valves were designed based on 
the concept of a cantilever beam (Zengerle et al. 1992; Koch 
et al., 1997; Sim et al., 2003). However, the complicated 
fabrication procedures and the fatigue of the moving parts 
need to be considered. Another method to rectify the flow 
direction is to use the floating passive valves such as ball 
valves and planar valves (Accoto et al, 2000; Yamahata et 
al., 2005; Pan et al., 2005; Zahn et al., 2001). The ball or 
plates are confined by some structures so that the moving 
part moves along the steamwise direction only. However, 
when designing a ball valve, the ball should be placed in the 
circular microchannel which is not easy to precisely 
fabricate using the MEMS techniques.     
The purpose of the present study is to develop a 
reciprocating-type micropump with high flow-rectifying

of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 4. An externally-
triggered measuring technique for the oscillatory flow was 
employed to measure the displacement of the moving parts in 
our experiment (Sheen et al, 2007; Sheen et al, 2008). 
Fluorescent particles (DukeTM) with a diameter of 1m were 
used to demonstrate the motion of the moving parts and to 
measure the flow field. The volume ratio of the seeding particle 
to the liquid was less than 1%. The excitation and emission 
peaks of the particles were at 542nm and 612nm, respectively. 
The Nd-YAG laser with wavelength of 532nm and double-
pulsing at 15Hz was used to illuminate the flow field. The laser 
pulses were expanded and transmitted into the microscope by 
means of a liquid-light-guide. A 10X object lens with a 
numerical aperture of 0.35 was used to collect the fluorescent 
emission. A high sensitivity CCD with a resolution of 1600 x 
1200 pixels was mounted on the microscope to capture the 
images. The sampling rate of the CCD was not sufficient to 
capture the high frequency motions of the moving parts. 
However, with the use of the externally-triggered measuring 
technique we were able to provide the best solution to obtain 
the high quality images at any specific phase in a time period.  
The amplified squarewave signals generated by a function 
generator and a power amplifier were used to excite the PZT 
plate. The excitation voltages and frequencies of the square 
waves were 10-30V (rms value) and 0.1-2.0kHz, respectively. 
The squarewave signals and the externally-triggered signals 
were both provided by the function generator and were 
corrected with respect to the same reference phase. A 
synchronizer was used as a timing and control module in this 
experiment. The laser pulse and the CCD were activated in 
immediate succession when the synchronizer received the 
externally-triggered signals. In our experiment, the motions of 
the floating valves were recorded at every 10 degrees within a 
time period. The time precision of the synchronizer was 10-9 s, 
which was much shorter than 0.001% of the time period.  
4  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.1 Pumping efficiency 
Five different excitation voltages, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30V 
were used to drive the PZT plate. The pumping volume flow 
rates were measured ten times to obtain the mean value. Figure 
5 depicts the pumping flow rates at 10, 20, and 30V (the results 
for 15V and 25V are not shown). The results revealed that the 
micropump could drive the flow even at a low voltage of 10V. 
Higher volume flows were pumped out at the higher excitation 
voltages. The maximum pumping flow rate was 275l/min 
when the voltage of 30V was used. The test results also 
indicated that at a fixed voltage the volume flow rate increased 
almost linearly with the driving frequency. The error bars 
indicate the standard deviations of the testing results. The linear 
range was between 0.1kHz and 0.8kHz for the excitation 
voltages of 10 and 20V. However, for higher voltages such as 
30V, the range was reduced to 0.1kHz to 0.5kHz, beyond 
which the slope of the flow rate curve decreased. When the 
excitation frequency was higher than 0.8kHz, decreasing 
volume flow rates were obtained with increasing frequencies.  
In order to further investigate the characteristics of the 
pump performance in the linear operating regime, two 
quantitative indices of linearity and repeatability were 
evaluated. A linear fitting line for the experimental data in the 
linear regime was first determined by the least square method. 
The linearity was then calculated according to the correlation 
coefficient of the fittling line. The definition of correlation 
coefficient is given as follows.

where ix , iy , x , y  represent the frequency and the 
volume flow rate by the experimental result and the fitting line, 
respectively. The symbol n is the number of the testing points. 
The optima correlation coefficient is 1 when the variables x and 
y have perfect linear relationship.  
The other index, repeatability, was defined according to 
the comparsion between the standard deviation of the measured 
flow rates and the mean value. The definition of repeatability is 
shown as follows.

where jy  and y  are respectively the measured flow rate and 
their mean value for a specific condition. The symbol m  is 
the number of tests. The micropump has high repeatability if 
this value approaches 1.  
The results clearly exhibited that the correlation 
coefficients were all higher than 0.97. These coefficient were 
even higher than 0.99 when the volatges were higher than 10V. 
Moreover, good repeatabilities of the pumping flow rates were 
also obtained in the tests. The repeatability approached 0.95 
when the excitation voltages were higher than 10V. Any 
volume flow rate in the linear regime could be easily set by 
adjusting the driving frequency according to the calculated 
slopes. For example, the volume flow rate increased by 
0.17l/min at 20V when the excitation frequency was increased 
by 1 more Hertz. In other words, if a flow rate of 60l/min is 
needed, the driving frequency should be set to 350Hz. 
Therefore, a control module for the volume flow rates could be 
easily designed, which is favorable for the micro-TAS. 
The relationships between the volume flow rates and 
pump pressures at various excitation voltages are shown in Fig. 
6. The results clearly indicated that the pump pressure 
increased with an increasing frequency in the linear regimes. 
The maximum pump pressure at zero flow rate appeared at 
0.8kHz. However, the glass tube was too short to measure the 
maximum pump pressure at higher voltages such as 30V. The 
relationship between the volume flow rate and pump pressure at 
30V was fitted by least square method. Therefore, the optimum 
pump pressures increased from 2.1 to the expected 40kPa as the 
voltage increased from 10 to 30V. When the frequency was 
higher than 0.8kHz, the pump pressure was found to be 
decreased in our tests. The high pump pressure can provide 
sufficient driving force to overcome the flow resistance which

1. 研究摘要 
近幾年，生醫檢測技術、以及生物操控技術，因為微小化技術的日
趨成熟，而蓬勃發展。但是目前許多發展完善的實驗晶片，仍然都只
是單一技術上的實現，整合多種檢測技術於單一的實驗晶片，是大家
努力的目標。為了讓自身開發的感測技術能更加多元化，可真正結合
各種技術優點，並且可以利用到實際生活上，本研究欲結合 2008年本
實驗室開發的布朗運動運用於蛋白質檢測技術[1]、以及 2005年發表於
自然(Nature)期刊的 Opto-electric tweezer (OET) 操控技術[2]，希望可以
達到陣列式的檢測技術，以一次可以進行多點感測，真正達到可運用
在實際醫療檢測之目的。 
本實驗室前幾年已經開發完成的布朗運動檢測技術是一種不需要
晶片，直接透過影像擷取奈微米粒子布朗運動行為，以快速的電腦運
算檢測粒子在與抗原結合前後的奈微米粒子布朗運動改變狀況。這方
法非常易於整合在任何實驗室型晶片上，且又達到快速簡單的檢測方
式。但是這方法目前缺少一個可以快速且大量操控不同群落的粒子方
式，來達到一個陣列方式檢測。而目前任教於美國加州大學洛杉磯分
校(UCLA)機械與航太學系的 Prof. Eric Chiou所開發的 OET，整合光學
快速且易操控的特性、和介電泳操控粒子特性，在一發表就受到大家
矚目，並且廣泛研究以及利用在這種生物操控技術上。 
本研究實驗室經過評估後，認為此 OET 技術能真正符合本實驗室
之布朗運動檢測技術的需求，可達到粒子群落操控、混合、以及限制
粒子運動範圍等工作，最後完成檢測工作。本次前去 UCLA進行研究，
希望可以學習到該 OET技術，並由 Prof. Chiou的實驗室親自傳授，給
予更多先進的想法，並與本實驗室技術結合達到雙贏局面。此外，該
技術由於應用廣泛，目前仍然不斷被開發中，希望可以在學習回國後，
在台灣也開創出新的研究方向。

研究，並且願意提供我們他在 OET操控上面的概念。OET是非常適合
運用在同時進行大量粒子的個別操控的技術，如同當初發表的同時，
對大量細胞個別運輸、混合、分類等能力[2] 。於 2008年，Prof. Eric 
Chiou 使用光學 pixel 陣列投影的概念，對於各個陣列上的奈米粒子進
行操控[3]。此外 OET也運用於油滴液珠操控[4] ，此方法如果分別包
覆著奈米粒子與待檢測體，並與 electrowetting-driven (EWOD)結合做液
珠混合分離操控[5, 6]，再以 PTV方式量測布朗運動、以及分析其布朗
運動改變，最後反推其濃度達到定量檢測[1]。 
 
2.2研究目的 
此計畫目的主要是想利用 OET操控粒子方式來移動粒子到觀察區
域，並以欲觀察的方式排列，觀察區域以 CCD相機擷取連續影像，並
以 PTV演算法分析之。其個別原理如下： 
如圖一所示，非晶型的矽底材為目前所知的光感材料，以光照射
會產生導電性質。所以將其鍍在 ITO 導電玻璃上當作電極，一端再鍍
上一層氮化矽當作絕緣層，上蓋以 ITO 當作電極另一端，通以 AC 交
流電。以此裝置，當以非對稱光照圖案打在光敏電阻材料上，此晶片
會形成有如介電泳般的型式來驅動粒子。更進一步的，如果隨著粒子
移動來改變光照圖案，就可以隨心所欲的操控粒子的去向。如圖一所
示：以投影機方式，配合投影片連續撥放或是影片撥放軟體連續撥放
的方式來達到光照圖形的改變則是此研究發展突破的一大關鍵重點。 
量測布朗運動粒子方式感測生物分子的原理如圖二所示，是利用
粒子因為吸附上生物分子而導致粒子變大，使其布朗運動的擴散速
率、位移、方均根速度等指標性參數改變。以濃度定量為例，以修飾
有特定抗體的大量粒子，均勻混合到不同濃度定量帶測抗原溶液中，
當抗原濃度越高，其粒子上會吸附較多抗原，而使其擴散速率下降。
因此，我們可以靠著這個原理，在得到擴散速率隨時間改變的曲線後，
知道其鍵結解離常數，以及可以利用比較對照組方法反推其濃度。

測的生物分子越大越能顯現出效果。因此相信在其他檢測如細菌類所
引起敗血症也可以快速且更準確檢驗出來。 
在整合光電鉗的設計上，考慮了體積微小化、結構簡單、低電壓
電流與可多次使用等要件，是目前產業上缺乏的關鍵技術，本研究之
執行不但提高生物科技與製程整合，更可增加產品之應用性與系統功
能性，此外透過整合微機電製程，可同時完成成本降低及建立產業進
入門檻之商業化立基，將有利於未來相關生物檢測產品的商品化發展。 
3.3社會影響 
由於面對人口老化趨勢之影響，醫療費用支出成為許多國家財政
上之負擔，以歐洲各國為例，因為在檢驗上由於醫療費用成本之考量，
加速了對於定點照護檢測之需求，在歐洲市場亦是如此。除成本考量
之因素外，慢性病人口增加也是影響因素之一，為降低疾病導致之併
發症與死亡，藉由快速檢測以有效進行疾病監控，提升了定點照護需
求之價值。 
此研究的蛋白質檢測與分離的成果，可用於「生活科技區域整合
中心」之介電泳快速定點照護檢驗晶片的開發，未來亦可與其他微感
測器(如壓阻式微懸臂樑感測器等)進行結合，以增廣應用層面。

4.2 布朗運動檢測技術 
布朗運動檢測技術主要有三大核心即：抗體修飾於奈米粒子表
面、利用微粒子追蹤測速儀量測粒子布朗運動，以及布朗運動變化與
抗原抗體結合關係，以下針對這三部份的核心理論做一簡單描述。 
(A)抗體修飾於奈米粒子表面 
抗體修飾於奈米粒子表面方式如圖三所示：實驗使用 300nm 大小
的免疫沉澱用的聚苯乙烯(Polystyrene, PS)螢光粒子，且表面上已經修
飾上羧基(Carboxyl Group)。加入 EDC 作為連接抗體以及粒子的接合
劑，EDC一端為胺基（Amino Group）一端為羧基，胺基端會與奈米粒
子表面上的羧基形成共價鍵結另外一端的羧基則是用與抗體上的胺基
側鏈形成共價鍵結之用，惟 EDC在常溫下是一種容易水解的物質所以
需要加入 NHS幫助穩定。表面修飾完 EDC後再與抗體 Anti-CRP充分
時間反應，將抗體修飾在粒子表面。最後再以一級胺把沒有接上抗體
的羧基修飾掉避免影響實驗結果。 
(B)利用微粒子追蹤測速儀量測粒子布朗運動 
微粒子追蹤測速儀(Micro Particle Tracking Velocimetry，-PTV)如
圖四所示，是藉由放入粒子在工作流體當中，以非介入式的二維平面
微流場量測工具。該量測則是以 PTV 以及微粒子影像測速儀(Micro 
Particle Image Velocimetry，-PIV)衍伸出來的量測流體工具。-PIV
和-PTV都是可一次獲得即時的速度分布資訊，因此成為許多團隊發
展的重要量測技術。 
這兩套系統的主要硬體設備皆相同，最主要的差別在於分析的方
法。µ-PIV分析方法是將流體想要分析的區域切出如網格般的若干個分
析視窗(interrogation window)，在每個分析視窗內有若干個粒子，藉由
分析這些粒子在一段時間內的位移，每個分析視窗可以得到一個平均
位移向量，把位移向量除上以知的一段時間，則可以得到速度。µ-PTV
則是先以灰階值和像素大小來決定粒子位置，再以粒子位置附近為分
析範圍，分析時間順序的下一張影像上粒子在原位置附近的哪裡而得
 10 
CCD 擷取影像，透過高速電腦計算獲得粒子的布朗運動資訊隨時間變
化。 
(C) 布朗運動變化與抗原抗體結合關係 
本研究利用修飾上 anti-CRP 的奈米粒子其在液體中的布朗運動變
化因鍵結 CRP的數量隨時間改變而下降。圓球體布朗運動公式如下： 
3 p
kTD
dπµ
=  (3) 
2s D t= ∆  (4) 
其中Ｄ是擴散係數，k = 1.3805×10-23 J/K，T是腔體內溫度，μ動黏滯
係數，dp粒子直徑 s是擴散的平均位移。 
由公式(3)可以知道：假設室溫以及工作流體的動黏滯係數固定，
粒子的大小會直接影響到擴善係數，當 CRP與粒子均勻混合並注入腔
體內，粒子的直徑會隨時皆改變，也就是直接影響到擴散係數。 
將公式(4)整理後可以得到擴散係數Ｄ和布朗運動速度Ｖd如下： 
 
d
2DV
t
=
∆
 (5) 
將公式(3)代入(5)就可以知道隨時間改變的粒子大小和布朗運動速度的
關係。實驗中藉由µ-PTV 量測粒子的布朗運動速度及可以推算平均的
粒子大小。 
 
4.3光電鉗應用在布朗運動檢測技術 
OET 粒子操控技術和技術的結合，目前第一個面臨的挑戰是粒子
操控形式。目前有幾種形式考慮，第一以液珠形式分別包覆粒子與待
測物，並移到適當位置做液珠與液珠結合和混合，是目前考慮中可行
的方式之一。第二是以分群操控粒子方式，將粒子群移到適當位置與
抗體混合，這是另一種考慮可行方式。
