2. Abstract    
Single crystal diamond tool has the highest 
known hardness, good wear resistance, high 
conductivity, low in thermal expansion which 
makes it an ideal tool material for cutting 
precision diffractive optical elements, aspheric 
metal optical components etc. As long as tools 
are in use, it is only the matter of time tool will 
experience attritious wear, micro-fracture and 
eventually worn out. Since the surface roughness 
and form accuracy are very much depending on 
the sharpness and shape accuracy of the tool. 
Whatever is happened on the cutting edge will 
reflect on the workpiece. An effective and precise 
tool profile monitoring technique is of essential 
importance in ultra-precision diamond turning 
operation. The optical/non-contact way of tool 
profile monitoring has the advantage of not 
having to touch the tool, but its resolution is

5.1 Sobel operator [7] 
In comparison to other operators such as 
Laplacian and Canny, Sobel operator is relatively 
simple, fast computing and insensitive to noise. It 
is based on a pair of 3x3 convolution kernels 
(horizontal and vertical). The kernels are used to 
convolve with the input image and detect the 
horizontality and verticality gradients (Gx and Gy). 
Those kernels are given by:  
 
 
 )1,1(),1(2)1,1(
)1,1(),1(2)1,1(
+−+−+−−−

yxfyxfyxf
yxfyxfyxfG y
 
         (2) 
The magnitude of the gradient at each point can 
be expressed as: 2 2( , )G x y Gx Gy= + . The pixel 
will be regarded as part of the tool profile if 
( , )G x y  is large than the threshold value. These 
pixel-level “profile points” detected by Sobel 
operator have to be refined by Zernike moments 
operator. 
 
5.2 Zernike moments operator [15] 
Zernike function is a set of complex orthogonal 
functions which forms a complete orthogonal 
basis over the unit circle. The Zernike moment of 
order m with repetition n for a digital 
image ( , )f x y  is defined as follow: 
*1 ( , ) ( , )mn mn
x y
mZ f x y W r θ
pi
+
= ∑∑          (3) 
Where 2 2( ) 1x y+ ≤ , The Zernike 
polynomials ( , )mnW r θ of order m are defined as: 
  
( , ) ( ) jnmn mnW r R r e θθ −=             (4) 
  ( )mnR r  is real radial polynomial which 
defined as: 
∑−

mn rknmknmk
km
rR
(5) 
where m is a nonnegative integer, n is an integer 
subject to the constraint | |m n−  is even. 
The Zernike moments are rotation- invariant 
transformations.  If an image is rotated by an 
angle φ , the Zernike moments of the original 
image mnZ and the Zernike moments of the 
rotated image 'mnZ  have the following 
relationship: 
' jn
mn mnZ Z e
θ−
=
                     (6) 
  The rotation angle and the edge parameter L 
can be derived as:

                           (8) 
  In practical, Zernike moments can be calculated 
by convolving masks with the image points. [13]  
 
5.3 Optimum threshold value selecting by 
Zernike moments [16] 
  To extract the tool profile features, an 
automatic thresholding algorithm is adopted in 
this study for image-processing. This technique is 
based on maximizing the correlation between 
Zernike moments phases of the gray-level and 
binary images of the same objects.  
  The basic idea of this method is that the shapes 
of the binary image and original image are similar 
if the phases of two images are close to each other. 
Let ( , )g u vφ   be the phase of the gray image 
and ( , )th u vφ  be the phase of the threshold image. 
The optimal threshold is this maximizes the 
correlation between ( , )g u vφ  and ( , )th u vφ . The 
correlation function can be expressed as:

6. Precision tool shape measurement 
After the diamond tool is set up on the precision 
stage, a serious of image frames are taken during 
measurement. In each frame Sobel operator is 
used to obtain the pixel level tool profile based on 
the optimum threshold, followed by Zernike 
moments to refine the profile position.  
 
6.1 Algorithms 
  The algorithm for the proposed subpixel tool 
profile measurement consists of five steps: 
Step1. capture a serious of tool frames from 
precision positioning stage. 
Step2. use the Zernike threshold method to find 
 6
rather well from a macroscopic point of view. 
However, differences became obvious when 
taking a microscopic view.  
  Shown in Fig. 5 were the detailed view of the 
profiles, representing a small segment of the 
diamond tool, generated by the SFD and MFD 
detection method. Note that SFD profile had small 
fluctuation on the detected profile map due to the 
noise and the insufficient information.    
  The detected profile was then compared with 
the modified profile data measured the Form 
Talysurf (Fig. 6). Though certain details were 
missing in the MFD-generated profile, the general 
trend of the profiles were in good agreement.

1 Introduction 
Mono-crystal diamond tool has the virtue of possessing the highest known hardness, good wear resistance, high conductivity, low in 
thermal expansion which makes it a ideal tool material for cutting precision diffractive optical elements(DOE/HOE), aspheric metal 
optical components etc [1-3]. However, as long as tools are in use, it is only the matter of time tool will experience attritious wear, 
micro-fracture and eventually worn out. Since the surface roughness and form accuracy are very much depending on the sharpness and 
shape accuracy of the tool. Whatever is happened on the cutting edge will be reflected on the workpiece. An effective and precise tool 
profile monitoring technique is of essential importance in ultra-precision diamond turning operation[4]. The optical/non-contact way of 
setting the tool do have the advantage of not having to touch the tool, but its resolution is limited by the optical diffraction limit and 
the resolution of the CCD device used (mm/pixel). A non-contact precision tool profile monitoring system is developed and built in 
this study using edge-detection image processing and sub-pixel dividing techniques in conjunction with CNC controller of the 
precision turning machine to improve the system presently available. 
 
2 Experimental 
The optical tool setting system used in this study consists of a lighting pad, a CCD camera and related frame grabber/computing units. 
After the tool image is captured using the CCD camera and frame grabber unit, a digitized image function ),( yxf  is generated based 
on the gray-level of the image sampling points (x, y) on the CCD sensor. This image function has the information of the cutting tool 
together with various noises introduced by debris, reflection, diffraction and background scattering which have to be minimized if a 
precise tool profile is to be identified. Since most of the noises involved have the strong and spikelike nature, a median filter is 
adopted here for noise reduction. Owing to the discrete nature of the digitized image, the detected tool edge appears to be a 
combination of small pieces of line segments.  
After fetching the tool images into the image-processing unit, a threshold needs to be decided by the system to extract the tool profile 
from the obtained image. Zernike moments have been used to automatic produce threshold from gray level image. This technique is 
based on maximizing the correlation between Zernike moments' phases of the gray-level and binary images of the same objects. This 
method is based on the intensity of phase correlation between origin image and binary image. If the phases of two images are close to
