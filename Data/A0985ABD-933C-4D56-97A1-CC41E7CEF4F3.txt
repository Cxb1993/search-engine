2. Abstract
The objectives of this research are to develop
low cost, non-laser based optical sensors and to
apply these sensors for simultaneous measurements
of local flame-front velocity, equivalence ratio
(mixture fraction), and temperature in turbulent
premixed hydrocarbon flames to investigate the
effect of turbulent-chemistry interaction on
pollutant formation. The formation of pollutant in
turbulent flames is affected by local flame velocity
(strain rate), stoichiometry, and temperature.
Therefore, simultaneous measurements of
quantitative information in turbulent flames not
only allow a better understanding of pollutant
formation mechanisms but also provide useful
information for adjusting combustion status to
reduce pollutant emission and increase combustion
efficiency. However, it is generally required
sophisticated and expensive laser as well as
measurement systems to obtain these information
simultaneously. Hence, the Principal Investigator
proposes this three-year-term’s research to develop
optical sensor systems in which expensive laser,
spectrometers and intensified CCD cameras are
excluded. In the first year (8/2005~7/2006), two
sets of aberration-free Cassegrain mirrors and
spectroscopic analyzers will be developed to test
the applicability of the system in laminar premixed
and partially premixed swirling flames.
Keywords: Low cost optical sensor, Cassegrain
mirror, Swirling flame, Chemiluminescence
3. Introduction
Swirling flows have been widely used in
industrial burners in order to increase fuel-air
mixing and to improve flame stabilization. It has
been shown that swirl can increase mixture
homogeneity and shorten the characteristic time for
NOx formation and result in lower NOx emissions
[1-3]. However, in non-premixed swirling flames,
the reduction of NOx emissions is generally
accompanied by an increase of CO emissions.
Recently, the pollutant emissions generated from
partially premixed swirling methane jet flames were
measured to study the effect of partial premixing on
EINOx and EICO and to develop a scaling law for
EINOx [4]. Measurements indicated that
minimization of both NOx and CO emissions can be
achieved with an optimum level of partial
premixing in swirling flames. Although similar
trend of decrease then increase in EINOx with
increasing levels of partial premixing, as that in
laminar flames, was observed in partially premixed
swirling methane flames, more information such as
radical concentration, reaction rate, and local flame
stoichiometry are needed to provide further
3corrected for background radiation at single-pulse
basis. Since the chemiluminescence measurement
system collects a length of 3.34 mm of light onto
the ICCD camera, the image can be divided into 8
points in the spatial direction to obtain a
corresponding spatial resolution of 0.42 mm in the
measurements. The dependence of OH*/CH* and
C2*/OH*ratio on the equivalence ratio is
respectively shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for 0.42 mm
resolution. The intensity ratios are from background
corrected, time-averaged peak intensities. In the
present study, the calibration is made for each point,
i.e., 8 points have 8 calibration curves.
In order to test the ability of the
chemiluminescence measurement technique, we
apply the calibration curves obtained from laminar
flame measurements to a partially premixed
swirling flame (F = 3.1). The measured radial
distribution of equivalence ratio at X = 20, 40, 60,
and 80 mm is shown in Fig. 6. Experimental results
indicate that the measured equivalence ratios at the
fuel-side region (r 2 mm) are less than those
measured at the reaction zone (2 mm < r < 4 mm)
for X = 20 and 40 mm. This unrealistic result is due
to less OH and C2 are produced in the fuel-side
region of the flame. For further downstream
locations (X = 60 and 80 mm), more OH and C2 are
formed in the fuel-side region and result in the
measured equivalence ratio of 1.2-1.3.
6. Conclusions
Spatially resolved measurements of flame
emission spectra using two Cassegrain mirrors and
two spectrometers are performed and used to obtain
the correlation of the intensity ratio of OH*/CH*
and C2*/OH* to the equivalence ratio in laminar
flames over an equivalence ratio range of 0.8-1.4.
The calibration curves are then applied to measure
the local equivalence ratio in a partially premixed
swirling flame. Experimental results indicate that
this non-laser based chemiluminescence technique
can only be applied to determine the local flame
stoichiometry in the reaction zone of partially
premixed swirling methane flames.
7. Self Evaluation
In this project, a low cost optical sensor system
has been developed for chemiluminescence
measurements in laminar premixed and partially
premixed swirling flames. The capability of the
developed system has been demonstrated by
measuring the local equivalence ratio in a partially
premixed swirling flame. Results of this year’s
research have been published in Combustion
Science and Technology (see Appendix). The
development of the system for flame-front velocity
and temperature is underway.

Spatially resolved, time-averaged, multipoint measurements of flame
emission spectra using two Cassegrain mirrors and two spectro-
meters are performed and the results are used to obtain the corre-
lation of the intensity ratio of OH=CH and C2=OH to the
equivalence ratio in the laminar flames over an equivalence ratio
range of 0.8–1.4. Results show that a strong correlation exists
between the intensity ratio and equivalence ratio. The calibration
equations obtained from the laminar flame measurements are then
applied to obtain the local equivalence ratio in a partially premixed
swirling flame. Experimental results demonstrate that multipoint
measurement of local equivalence ratio in the partially premixed
swirling methane flames is feasible. However, this non-laser based
chemiluminescence technique can only be applied to determine
the local flame stoichiometry in the reaction zone of the flames.

equivalence ratio in laminar and turbulent flames (Roby et al., 1998;
Kojima et al., 2000, 2005), atmospheric pressure micro-gas turbine com-
bustor (Hardalupas et al., 2004), and swirl and liquid fuel combustors
(Muruganandam et al., 2005). Most of these chemiluminescence mea-
surements used traditional lenses to collect the global emissions, and
there is insufficient spatial resolution to measure the local equivalence
ratio at the flame front. To overcome this deficiency, Cassegrain optics
with high spatial resolution was proposed (Akamatsu et al., 1999;
Kojima et al., 2003; Hardalupas et al., 2004).
Although the chemiluminescence measurement techniques have
been successfully applied to turbulent flames for determination of local
equivalence ratio, most of investigations were made in the ‘‘premixed’’
flames with ‘‘single point’’ measurement. No ‘‘multipoint’’ measurement
of local equivalence ratio along a line in the ‘‘non-premixed’’ or
‘‘partially premixed’’ flames has been demonstrated. Multipoint measure-
ment of local equivalence ratio along a line provides instantaneous
sensing of stoichiometry across the flame front. In addition, the mea-
sured equivalence ratio can be converted to mixture fraction and hence
one-dimensional scalar dissipation rates in turbulent flames may be
deduced if simultaneous measurement of temperature is made and the
time and length scales of the flames can be resolved (Nandula et al.,
1994). Therefore, in the present study, the application of a chemilumi-
nescence sensor for multipoint local equivalence ratio measurements
in a partially premixed flame is reported. Two Cassegrain mirror systems
originally designed for Raman scattering measurements (Cheng et al.,
1998b) are used to simultaneously detect C2
=OH and OH=CH in
laminar methane=air flames for calibration purposes. The calibration
equations, which express the dependence of OH=CH and C2=OH
ratios on the equivalence ratio, are then applied for local equivalence
ratio measurements in a partially premixed swirling flame.

Measurement Systems
The experimental setup of measurement system is shown in Figure 2.
The schematic diagram of the Cassegrain optics is also shown in the
figure. Cassegrain optics consists of a primary and a secondary mirror,
which avoids the generation of chromatic aberrations for different wave-
lengths. The Cassegrain optics are designed by the ray-tracing method,
and its effective probe volume is estimated based on the designed para-
meters. Since the designed rms spot size (focal point) of Cassegrain
optics is 0.328mm and the magnification ratio is 2.36, thus the theoreti-
cal diameter of the sample volume is about 0.14mm which is comparable
to a value of 0.2mm of the MICRO system (Akamatsu et al., 1999;
Kojima et al., 2003). In addition, because the effective width of the
ICCD chip is about 7.9mm, a line-of-light of 3.34mm (¼7.9mm=2.36)
is imaged from the sample volume. If we divide 3.34mm by 8 sections,
then the spatial resolution across the flame axis is about 0.4mm. For
the estimation of depth of field, we adapt the f=# of the MICRO system
and compare to ours to arrive at the estimation of depth of field. For
example, the f number of the primary mirror of MICRO system is
f=# ¼ 3.013 (452mm=150mm) and the f=# of ours is f=# ¼ 1.6917
(296mm=175mm). Smaller f=# clearly permits more light to reach the
image plane with the same depth of field.
Akamatsu et al. (1999) used a core diameter of 0.2mm of optical
fiber to transmit the light for intensity distribution measurement and they
estimated the effective control volume of MICRO system to be 1.6mm
long and 0.2mm in diameter. Kojima et al. (2003) also used the same
MICRO system but with a d ¼ 0.1mm optical fiber and they estimated
the effective probe volume to be 0.8mm in depth and 0.1mm in
diameter. Since the entrance slit height of spectrometer is opened to
0.3mm for the present study, which is three times the optical fiber diam-
eter used by Kojima et al. (2003). Therefore, the effective cross-section of
probe volume of our Cassegrain optics is estimated to be 0.169mm
(¼0.1mm 3 1.6917=3.013) in height and 1.348mm (¼0.8mm
3 1.6917=3.013) in depth. The estimated height (0.169mm) of the
probe volume is close to the theoretical diameter of 0.14mm. The esti-
mated effective probe volume for the present Cassegrain optics is
0.4mm 0.2mm 1.4mm. Nevertheless, the depth of field (1.4mm)
can be reduced by reducing the slit height or using a 0.1mm diameter
optical fiber for light collection such that the background flame emission
SPATIALLY RESOLVED FLAME EMISSION SPECTRA 1825
signals collected away from the effective control volume can be greatly
reduced.
A flat-flame Hencken burner is operated in a ‘‘nonpremixed’’ mode
to produce laminar methane=air flames for the calibration measure-
ments. The burner is composed of fuel tubes distributed in a honeycomb
matrix (25.4mm 25.4mm). Air travels through the empty interstices
and results in many tiny diffusion flamelets near the surface of the bur-
ner. The calibration was made at the center and 5mm above the burner
surface where we believe is in the uniform post-flame zone, though the
height is still far from the location of equilibrium post-flame zone (say
3 cm above the burner surface). Chemiluminescence signals emanating
from the sample volume are collected and focused by the Cassegrain
optics and relayed to the entrance slit of a 0.275m, f=3.8 spectrometer
(Acton Research Co., SpectraPro-275) with a 1200 grooves=mm grating
(3 nm=mm dispersion) and a 0.5m, f=4 spectrometer (SPEX-500M) with
a 1800 grooves=mm grating (1.1 nm=mm dispersion). An intensified
CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, 576 384 array, 22 22 mm
pixels) is aligned at the exit plane of the spectrometer for monitoring
the emission signals. The measured signals are digitized with a 14-bit
A=D card connected to a personal computer for data reduction. The
spectral coverage of the 0.275m spectrometer is 36 nm and that of the
0.5m spectrometer is 14 nm. The entrance slit of spectrometer is set
perpendicular to the flame axial direction. Both spectrometers are
aligned by a laser beam to ensure that a same length of 3.34mm is
imaged onto each ICCD camera. This enables the image to be divided
into points in the spatial direction to obtain the spatial resolution of
measurements.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chemiluminescence Spectra
In order to study the natural chemiluminescence emission a series of
laminar flame emission spectra are taken at several different equivalence
ratios. Figure 3 shows the typical emission spectra collected in the lami-
nar flames for U ¼ 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 with 1 ms of ICCD camera gate time.
The measured spectra are obtained from an average of 200 spectral
measurements using a 0.275m spectrometer with narrow entrance slit
(100 mm) to spectrally separate the individual lines. In the spectra,
OH(0, 0), OH(1, 0), CH(0, 0), and C2(1, 0) band emissions are clearly
SPATIALLY RESOLVED FLAME EMISSION SPECTRA 1827
Although Figure 4 shows significant background light contributions to
C2
(1, 1) and C2(0, 0) bands, their emission intensities are higher than
those of C2
(1, 0) band (Kojima et al., 2000). Therefore, the C2(0, 0)
and C2
(1, 1) bands (named as C2 band) will be used for chemilumi-
nescence emission measurements. In addition, simultaneous monitoring
of the C2
(0, 0) and C2(1, 1) bands may be used for temperature measure-
ment through the emission intensity ratio of two vibrational bands, if the
signal strengths between two bands are strong enough (Ishiguro et al.,
1998). Under the conditions studied, the profiles of OH, CH, and C2
spectra do not vary much with changes of equivalence ratio. However,
the peak intensity of each band spectrum is strongly related to the

(0, 0) band measured from laminar methane-air
flames at (a) U ¼ 0.8, (b) U ¼ 1.0, (c) U ¼ 1.2.

calibration curves. Last, the wide opened entrance slit width of the detec-
tion system allows more light to be measured but degrades the spatial
resolution by increasing the depth of field and also results in a broader
spectral linewidth (as the detection system employed here). Neverthe-
less, it has been shown that applying the background correction could
significantly improve the sensitivity of the technique (Muruganandam
et al., 2005).

comparison with the data of Kojima et al. (2005). In all three spatial
resolutions, the 0.42mm resolution shows the greatest sensitivity, and
appears to be the best candidate for determining equivalence ratio.
Although the 0.21mm has twice better resolution than that of
0.42mm, the uncertainty of intensity ratio is about twice as large. In
addition, the spatial resolution of 0.67mm gives higher signal-to-noise
ratio than those of 0.4mm. However, due to non-uniformity of the
CCD chip, the integrated peak signals (after binning process) do not
increase linearly proportional to the increased spatial resolution. There-
fore, we found that the spatial resolution with largest slope (best sensi-
tivity) for our present measurement system is 0.4mm. The log curve fit
equation of the dependence of OH=CH and C2=OH on the equival-
ence ratio for the 0.42mm resolution is also shown in Figures 6 and 7,
respectively. These curve fit equations will be used for equivalence ratio
measurements in the turbulent flame.
ThedependenceofOH=CH andC2=OH on the equivalence ratio for
8 sections (0.42mm resolution) is respectively shown in Figures 8 and 9.

=OH ratio on equivalence ratio for three
different spatial resolutions.
SPATIALLY RESOLVED FLAME EMISSION SPECTRA 1833
It is noted that the greater scattering of data points atU ¼ 0.8 is due to lower
chemiluminescence emissionofCH andC2. Thismeans that this technique
would lead to greater uncertainties in equivalence ratiomeasurements if the
local equivalence ratio is less than 0.9. Nevertheless, the high degree of cor-
relation indicates that the local equivalence ratio at the flame front can be
determined by spatially resolved chemiluminescence measurements. In
the same manner, equations for prediction of the local equivalence ratio
can be derived from the curve fit of data points for each section, similar to
those presented in Figures 6 and 7. For all calibration conditions and for a
given value of equivalence ratio, the OH=CH and C2=OH ratio is within
10% of the value given by each curve fit equation, which leads to an uncer-
tainty of approximately  0.1 for determination of equivalence ratio for
0.9U 1.4. It should be noted that the uncertainty of our measurement
system is approximately twice as large as those reported by Kojima et al.
(2000) and Hardalupas et al. (2004), due to lower quantum efficiency of
the ICCD detectors used in this study.
Measurements of a Partially Premixed Swirling Flame
Prior to applying the technique described above for equivalence ratio
measurements in the partially premixed swirling flame, the global picture
of the flame is presented first. Figure 10 illustrates video and natural
chemiluminescence emission images of a partially premixed swirling
flame (UF ¼ 3.1). The photograph shows that the flame exhibits blue
color, indicating elimination of soot particles by partial premixing. It
has been shown that the colors of the partially premixed swirling meth-
ane flames became completely blue at UF ¼ 4.5 (Cheng et al., 2001),
close to the value of 5 observed in laminar methane flames (Gore and
Zhan, 1996). The blue color with increasing premixing in methane
flames is attributed to an increase in CH radicals (Gaydon and Wolfhard,
1978). Chemiluminescence emission images of CH, C2, and OH are
respectively taken by placing an interference bandpass filter in front
of the ICCD camera. The center wavelength, half-band width, and
transmitting efficiency of the optical filters for CH, C2, and OH mea-
surements are 430 nm=10 nm=40%, 510 nm=10 nm=45%, and 307.1 nm=
10 nm=15%, respectively. The instantaneous CH distribution is in quali-
tative agreement with photograph observation. The distributions of CH,
C2
, and OH intensities indicate that the ratio of chemiluminescence
emission may be used for equivalence ratio measurements in this flame.
SPATIALLY RESOLVED FLAME EMISSION SPECTRA 1835
may be due to incomplete subtraction of the broadband background
emissions. Since the C2
 signal is obtained from the sum of the C2(0, 0)
and C2
(1, 1) peaks and the baseline of the C2(0, 0) band is not as flat
as those of OH and CH bands; therefore, incomplete subtraction of
the background emissions associated with CO2
 or HCO may result in
slightly higher C2
=OH ratio and hence higher equivalence ratio.
Nevertheless, the measured equivalence ratio is still within the experi-
mental uncertainty (0.1) for the present system. These results also
suggest that the intensity ratio of OH=CH is a more sensitive measure
of equivalence ratio for methane flames as reported by Muruganandam
et al. (2005) and Kojima et al. (2005). The measured local equivalence
ratio seems reasonable because the strongly swirling air could rapidly
reduce the premixed fuel-rich mixtures (UF ¼ 3.1) to a leaner condition.
Although multipoint measurements of local equivalence ratio in a partially
premixed swirling flame have been demonstrated to be feasible, the
accuracy of this technique strongly depends upon the efficiency of the
detectors. Moreover, the technique seems only applicable to the reaction
zone of the flames where excited species OH, CH, and C2 are formed.

locations in a partially premixed swirling flame (UF ¼ 3.1).
SPATIALLY RESOLVED FLAME EMISSION SPECTRA 1837
partially premixed swirling flame. Experimental results show that multi-
point measurement of local equivalence ratio in the flame is feasible.
However, this non-laser-based chemiluminescence technique can only
be applied to determine the local flame stoichiometry in the reaction
zone of partially premixed swirling methane flames. Further improve-
ment of the sensitivity of measurement system can be achieved by using
higher quantum efficiency detectors and reducing the spectral line-
widths. Moreover, simultaneous measurements of equivalence ratio and
temperature are possible if the signal strength of the C2
(0, 0) and C2(1, 1)
bands are strong enough. Therefore, one-dimensional scalar dissipation
rates in partially premixed flames may be deduced to help understand the
effects of mixing and combustion processes on the behavior of NOx
emissions, if the flame time scale is comparable to the lifetime of chemilumi-
nescence signal and can be resolved by the present technique.
