Abstract 
This study investigated the effects of color combination, polarity, and 
luminance contrast on memory of text presented on VDT. The results 
showed that the main effects of color combination, polarity, and luminance 
contrast on memory were not statistically significant. However, the 
significant interaction of color combination and luminance contrast 
indicated that memory for preferred color combinations（white-on-black 
and blue-on-yellow）was greater at luminance contrast 1:7 than 1:3. 
However, memory for less-preferred color combinations（green-on-purple 
and purple-on-green）was better at luminance contrast 1:3 than 1:7. 
Furthermore, memory performance for paper was similar to that for VDT; 
i.e., VDT seems not detrimental to memory.

Among the six color combinations, 
black-on-white, blue-on-yellow, and 
purple-on-green are positive polarity, the 
rest are negative polarity. Three levels of 
luminance contrast were employed: 1:3, 1:7, 
and 1:10. The luminance contrasts were 
constructed by the combination of a dark 
color (luminance fixed at 10 cd/m2) and a 
bright color (luminance at 30, 70, or 100 
cd/m2). (see Table.1) Six participants were 
randomly assigned to each of the 6 (color 
combinations) × 3(luminance contrasts) =18 
experimental treatments. To compare VDT 
with paper, another 6 participants completed 
the experiment with paper as the display 
medium in which experimental material 
were presented in black-on-white and 
luminance contrast 1:10.

2.3 Apparatus & Workplace condition 
The computer equipment was a 
Pentium-IV personal computer with a 17-in 
Philips Brilliance-107 CRT of 338mm × 
272mm. The pixel resolution was 1024 
horizontally and 768 vertically. The paper 
was A4 size in horizontal. The luminance of 
the text and background of the three display 
media were measured by Minolta Color 
Analyzer CA-100. The Topcon SS-3 
screenscope and the Standard 
pseudo-Isochromatic Charts were used to 
examine subject’s visual acuity and color 
vision.  
The computer screen was positioned on a 
table 74cm in height. The distance from 
center of the screen to the table was 27 cm 
and 40 cm to each edge of the table. The 
inclination angle was 105° with respect to 
the vertical axis. Every subject can adjust 
their viewing distance and sitting posture 
until they can clearly see the text presented 
on VDT. Fluorescent lamps illuminated the 
VDT workstation. The ambient illumination 
was about 700 lux which is the normal level 
in office. No glare or reflection appeared on 
the screen.  
2.4 Task & Procedure 
The memory material was a set of 16 
2-character Chinese words. They were 
shown simultaneously in a 15mm ×15mm 
area each and randomly displayed as 4 
columns by 4 rows on the screen for 30 
seconds. Then, participants performed free 
recall of the material for 1 minute. The 
number of correctly recalled items was 
recorded. Each participant completed the 
above cycle for 10 times. The numbers of 
correctly recalled items for the last three 
cycles (ie. 8, 9, 10) were averaged for 
statistical analyses.

lower luminance contrast 1:3. Further, the 
effects of polarity and interactions involving 
polarity were not significant. To present text 
in dark on light background (positive 
polarity) or in light on dark background 
(negative polarity) did not make much 
difference.
