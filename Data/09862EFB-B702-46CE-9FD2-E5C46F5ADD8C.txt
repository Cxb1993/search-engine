VI. Information Dynamics of Human-Centric 
Communication and Social Networking 
VI.1 Introduction 
The purpose of this research project is to seek fundamental breakthroughs in 
human’s knowledge about human-based communication networks and thus the 
application based on it, to develop the new generation of human behavior-based research 
and related theory based on it. We shall execute some pioneer explorations into this goal 
from frontiers of human-based communication networks and different branches of 
science (physics, mathematics, cognitive, and social). 
 
We have recognized that, Tremendous growing of Internet applications and services 
creates a new life style for human being. With the help of web 2.0, Facebook and many 
popular Internet services leverage social relationship to achieve great success, such that 
people pay attention to individuals and relations constructing an equivalent network 
structure, known as social networks. Social networks [1] [2] impacts the behaviors and 
interactions among people, groups, and Internet services, may contain an unimaginably 
vast amount of digital data that is getting even more vaster and more rapidly. To 
effectively manipulate and to compute these data creates a new dimension of challenge 
and new possibility of learning more information to facilitate Internet services. Such data 
typically comes from the network structure with million or billions of vertices and edges, 
showing great complexity both in dimension and composition. Despite the abundance of 
tools to capture, to process and to share all data - sensors, computers, mobile phones and 
user behaviors, etc. - it is still very wanted to develop efficient computation and 
maintenance. Moreover, we usually wish to infer appropriate actions or decisions [3] to 
meet some application purposes from such widely shared data in social networks, while 
directly related. In general, Y = f(       ) but      may reserve unknown. A sampling 
process     is a relation from state space to observation space. Thus, data is a 
sampling on the observation space. The goal of data processing is to draw any 
information about   based on observing (       ). If we define any formate of cost 
function  , the data processing is designing the function  ̂   ̂          to satisfy 
   
      
 [ ((        ̂))]  where   (       ) . This is a very complicated 
optimization problem, however, many techniques and theory has been developed to be 
introduced on this report. 
 
Regarding the issues of information and data processing on social network, many 
literatures have discussed it in variety of views. From social network analysis aspect, 
most of the discussions are based on fundamental knowledge of social network structures 
[5], [6], [7]. Thus we have the studying of distributed search [8], [9], information 
exchange [10], diffusion of social influence [11] and evolution of social networks [12] 
[13]. Such research focuses on the properties of information and data on the social 
network and derives many features of corresponding behavior models; however, lacking 
the study of how to processing the information and data. Some exactly solvable models 
of the structure of social networks, based on random graphs with arbitrary degree 
distributions are derived to capture some properties of the data in social networks [14]. 
On the other hand, without the consideration of data collection, we have developed 
statistical inference and signal processing [15], regression analysis [16], and nonlinear 
data structure analysis [17]. These treatment focus on deriving optimal information 
extraction (i,e,  ̂    and seldom reach the topics of data with correlations and high 
dimensions). 
been proposed to understand this issue. One of the main challenges is to determine the 
connectivity of several interactive networks. Such problem arises when secondary users 
and primary users transmit at the same time. In order to use the spectrum more efficiently, 
the secondary user might want to cooperate with each other. Whether cooperation means 
efficiency in this scheme is a serious issue and that becomes the main motivation in this 
project. In this project, we study the connectivity of cooperative secondary network from 
a percolation-based perspective. 
  
 
VI.2.1 Part 1: Network Synchronization Among Femtocells 
  
Femtocells had been recognized as an essential technology  to  achieve  high  data  
rate  requirements  toward the forth generation (4G) wireless system defined by IMT-
Advanced [1], [2]. Femtocells, formed by home base stations (abbreviated as HeNBs in 
3GPP), are haphazardly deployed by users to the indoor environment overlaying existing 
Macrocells. However, it is also such high data rate requirements that result in the 
infeasibility of frequency partitions among all femtocells and the Macrocell. The 
Macrocell and all femtocells thus shall fully reuse all available common spectrum. Such 
universal frequency reuse consequently induces severe interference between the 
Macrocell and the femtocell, and among femtocells under a dense deployment. Such an 
interference problem has been considered as the most critical issue for a successful 
realization of the femtocell technology in LTE-Advanced [3], [4] and an effective 
autonomous interference mitigation  scheme  thus is urgently required. Recently, this 
challenge attracts a number of effective solutions for interference mitigation between the 
Macrocell and femtocells [5]–[8], and among femtocells [9]. However, one critical 
assumption in these solutions is a well timing synchronization between the Macrocell and 
all femtocells overlaying the Macrocell. 
To achieve such critical network synchronization between the  Macrocell  and  all  
femtocells  overlaying  the  Macrocell, IEEE  1588  [10]  is  proposed  in  WiMAX  to  
deliver  timing information from a synchronization server to all femtocells through the 
wired backhaul, by which each HeNB can measure the timing difference between the 
HeNB itself and the centralized synchronization server [11], [12]. Each HeNB thus can  
Macrocell faces a challenge, it does not know which of its neighboring HeNBs achieves  
a  successful  synchronization  to  the  Macrocell.  If a HeNB keeps synchronizing to 
another HeNB without the synchronization to the Macrocell, the issue of the timing os- 
cillation among femtocells occurs. That is, timings of HeNBs never converge to a 
common value.  
 
VI.2.2 Part 2: Time Synchronization in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks 
Time synchronization in wireless ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks 
has been studied for years [1], [2]. It is also essential in various network categories, such 
as wireless LAN and cellular networks. Early research on time synchronization focused 
on the timing alignment between a sender-receiver pair, or among a sender to many 
receivers [2]. Since these analogous algorithms focus on synchronization in a small group 
at a time based on a speciﬁc network scenario, they usually take more realistic factors 
into consideration, such as transmission latency or clock drifts. Recent efforts mainly 
focus on the network synchronization [3], [4], to consider the timing variables 
exchanging among nodes. Notably, the latest gossip algorithms [4] simply needs the 
nodes to exchange the timing with their neighbor nodes, through some simple 
calculations on each interaction, to achieve synchronization. 
Modern networks usually consist of various heterogeneous subnetworks [5], which merge 
as a large-scale network. The heterogeneity of modern network makes the time 
synchronization become a potential challenge. There exists some major issues of time 
synchronization in heterogeneous networks. First, there may not have common 
infrastructures among heterogeneous networks, thus the synchronization algorithm 
should be distributed. Secondly, the information exchange mechanism cannot be too 
complicated due to lacking of common protocols/interface that allows information 
exchange. The computation and communication overhead should also be as minimal as 
possible. Furthermore, we cannot ensure that the timing of all devices in the 
heterogeneous networks are reliable. The heterogeneity introduces more uncertain 
factors, such as uncontrolled devices, or even malicious nodes from network security 
concern. Thus the synchronization algorithm should be robust to prevent the error timing 
among agents in social networks, in which the relationship between agents shows great 
impact on the formation of information. Relationship in social network is regarded as 
social network structure. Many works have admitted that the social network structure 
does impacts the function and behavior of information on it, such as information 
exchange [2] and dynamics [3]. The information on such networks exhibits patterns quite 
different from classical scenario and thus requires more suitable consideration for 
designing criterion for optimal information fusion. 
The main features of information on social networks are displayed as follow: The issue 
we encounter is the rapidgrowth in dimension and complicatedness of the information 
resulting from the complexity and huge scale of the network, which makes it 
cumbersome and non-practical to implement deterministic topology to satisfy the demand 
of analysis. However, statistical mechanics provides a statistical view to describe the 
characteristic of network in the fashion of complex network [4] [5]. We also receive great 
success on communication networks with statistical communication theory, thus a 
statistical approach shall be the first concern. Furthermore, the information on the social 
network is also suffered from not only the interference form personal observation but also 
the possibly deception or wrong interpretation by other agents in the network [6], which 
is similar to the case in communication network. In addition, the anonymous nature of 
some information platform results in difficulty in measurement of network structure. 
Furthermore, information fusion often infers the event without certain information (e.g., a 
priori probability or exact density function of observations etc.). Thus a minimax robust 
technique [7] is required on constructing the fusion rule. 
Different from classical statistical view, social networks have so many possible 
states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on 
simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-
order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role [8]. As a first 
step beyond the information fusion, much attention has been focused on the pairwise 
correlation properties of network agents, which is of urgent demand for proper modeling. 
In the social network, any agent is either an independent decision maker or just a decision 
follower. This behavior leads to a new challenge on information fusion. Upon such issue, 
Jackson has provided a systematic approach to model the decision process as a Markov 
with spectrum pricing or network economics in heterogeneous WNs [3]–[11], where [8]–
[11] adopt cognitive radio technologies. [3] discusses heterogeneous network 
architectures to estimate the pricing for an incremental wireless data services. [4] 
proposes a simple radio resource allocation policy to maximize network capacity and 
users’ QoS. [5] proposes a simple QoS-based dynamic pricing approach for services 
provisioning to maximizes SPs’ revenue and to increase user satisfaction level by 
maximizing the provided QoS level and applying dynamic pricing strategies based on the 
QoS. [6] proposes a novel auction mechanism that prevents low of the auctioneers 
revenue of combinatorial winner auction mechanism for short term contract, stabilizes 
auction market, and enhances social welfare by allowing larger subset of users to become 
occasional winners of auction rounds than the traditional combinatorial winner selection 
does. [7] proposes a pricing-based end-to-end resource allocation and management 
architecture for the assurance of end-to-end QoS. [8] proposes a labor market for a 
cooperative spectrum sharing scheme in which secondary users may relay primary users’ 
traffic in exchange for dedicated transmission time for their own communication needs 
by contract theory. [9] proposes a novel interrelated market model for hierarchical 
spectrum/bandwidth sharing among primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary services. 
[10] and [11] address the problem of competitive pricing among multiple WNs to provide 
spectrum/bandwidth for cognitive radio users, who can access multiple WNs. However, 
few of these jointly discuss the satisfactory incentives of all SPs and all LUs for 
cooperative spectrum sharing scheme and verify the stability of the heterogeneous 
dynamic networking scenario. 
We formulate this fundamental cooperative spectrum sharing problem as a market 
model by introducing a roaming rate as the incentive for each SP to gain extra revenue 
while its LUs temporarily leverage other SPs service. Using the concept of demand and 
supply functions from economics, we obtain the equilibrium at which all SPs and all LUs 
satisfy the amount of allocated bandwidth and price simultaneously. In order to reach the 
equilibrium, naive and adaptive iterative algorithms are adopted based on local 
information due to the fact that global information may not be easy to obtain in 
decentralized implementation. Their stability conditions are also analyzed and, therefore, 
the heterogeneous WN would be stable for this cooperative spectrum sharing scheme. 
efficiency in this scheme is a serious issue and that becomes the main motivation in these 
theses. 
We therefore study the connectivity of cooperative secondary network from a 
percolation-based perspective. In [2], [3], the impact of fading on the percolation 
threshold of a wireless ad hoc network was investigated. We map the problem to a site-
percolation model [4] and derive the condition for the phase transition. To our 
knowledge, it is the first framework to jointly consider the effects of cooperation, 
interference, heterogeneity, and general fading on the percolation threshold. 
VI.3 System Model and Simulation 
VI.3.1 Part 1: Network Synchronization Among Femtocells 
To combat such timing oscillation issue due to the unavailability of information 
(whether a neighboring HeNB achieves a successful synchronization to the Macrocell) 
exchanges among femtocells, we develop a network synchronization algorithm for each 
HeNB. We mathematically prove the convergency of the proposed network 
synchronization algoithm, and thus resolve the challenge of the fundamental assumption 
to enable existing autonomously interference mitigation solutions. 
In this paper, we consider a typical dense femtocells deployment. That is, the 
enterprise scenario of femtocells. In this  scenario,  M  femtocells  are  deployed  in  a  
building  to fully cover whole area of the building, as shown in Fig. 1. To specifically 
describe such a scenario, following definitions are made. 
 
Definition 1.  We say that there is a link between two HeNBs if these two HeNBs can 
receive synchronization signals from each other. 
 
Note that the existence of a link between two HeNBs does not suggest that these two 
HeNBs can exchange data/information with each other. According the femtocell 
architecture defined by LTE-Advanced, there is no interface among femtocells for 
communications with each other [3].

where ∑ 𝜆

i=0  1 and λi ≥ 0 for all i. 
Step 4) Repeat Step 1 to Step 3. 
 
In Step 3a, the timing of the HeNB is updated according to the “convex combination” of 
the current timing of the HeNB and timings of selected HeNBs. Such a convex 
combination timing update results in an extremely low computational complexity, this it 
is very suitable for the HeNB with limited computational capability. In addition, this 
convex combination timing update also facilitates the convergence of timings of all 
femtocells. In the following section, we devote to provide the mathematical foundation 
on the convergence (network synchronization) of the proposed algorithm. 
For a HeNB that can not receive synchronization signals from the Macrocell, the 
timing update can be described by the equation of the form 
 
x0
t+  𝑊 𝑡 𝒙𝑡  
 
where x0

𝑡 ]𝑇  and 𝑊 𝑡  is an n + 1 × n + 1 matrix. Moreover, since λ0 𝜆    𝜆𝑛  are 
randomly and independently selected across the time, 𝑊 𝑡  is independent across the 
time. The following theorem suggests the convergence of the proposed network 
synchronization algorithm. 
 
Theorem 1. If all femtocells overlaying the Macrocell adopt the proposed network 
synchronization algorithm, all timings of femtocells converge in expectation to a 
common value. 
 
Theorem 2. The convergence rate of the proposed network synchronization rate is 
Tcon 𝜀  Θ 𝑀
2𝑙𝑜𝑔𝜀−  . 
 
 We adopt the system parameters of LTE Advanced in our simulation. In the 
VI.3.2 part 2: Time Synchronization in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks 
Without loss of generality, we study the synchronization of two heterogeneous 
networks, which is generally illustrated in Fig. 3. Assume network 1 and 2 are separately 
synchronized to time T1 and T2 in advance, and the two networks co-locate in the same 
area. Our goal is eliminating the gap of timing between two networks in a distributed 
manner. 
 
 
Fig. 3. A co-locate heterogeneous networks scenario with timing 𝑇  and 𝑇2 separately. 
 
 
To  prevent the  influence of  error timing  comes from uncontrolled  nodes,  one  
possible  solution  is  that  the  minority timing should follow the majority timing. Thus 
we suppose that the network with smaller size should follow the timing of network with 
larger size, but each node in two networks has no idea about which network is larger. We 
need a distributed synchronization algorithm that can reach the synchronization timing 
which was initially held by the majority nodes. Voter algorithm is effective in such a 
scenario, since it guarantees to  reach  synchronization  to  one  of  the  initial  states.  But 
we  should  consider  the  error  probability  of  reaching  the wrong synchronization state  
and the expected time to reach synchronization. We define the state mapping first, note 
that 𝑡  is timing of node  , and    is the corresponding state. 
 
 
 
Without  loss  of  generality,  we  assume  that  the  size  of network  1 is  larger  than  
network  2 in  this  paper.  Then we define the system reaching the error synchronization 
 To overcome the poor performance caused by partially connectible network 
topology, we assume the node can reach farther nodes by multi-hop transmissions, and 
propose a further improved algorithm with multi-hop sampling mechanism. Each node  
maintains a sampling hop counter  ℎ𝑜 𝑠 which records the number of hops it samples. 
Initially, the C hops of all node are equal to 1, that is, each node sample its one-hop 
neighbors. When a node changes its  state, its sampling hop counter is increased by 1, 
that is, the node samples one of its two-hops neighbors next time, and so on. Note that in 
each hop, we  randomly choose the  next sampling  node, thus  we do not need the 
routing protocols. The maximum number of hops is limited by  𝑚𝑎𝑥   𝑁𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁 , which is 
the minimum number of hops for nodes in the center can reach all nodes in the network. 
By increasing the sampling hop counter to reach farther nodes, the nodes can sample 
more equally. We state the multi-hop sampling mechanism in Algorithm 2. 
 
 
 
 
VI.3.3 Part 3: Robust Information Fusion on Social Networks  
We consider the general information fusion on social network. At first we introduce 
the framework of information fusion, and then we embed this concept into the social 
network structure. 
 
A. Information Fusion  
 
Generally speaking, information fusion involves observation and decision. We 
At this section, we are embedding information fusion into network structure. Every 
person in the society is treated as an agent (node). We focus on those agents in such 
(social) network who are sharing information with each other via an information platform 
as Fig. 1. As we have discussed in section I, how these agents relate (connect) to each 
other plays an important role on the formation of information. A graph theory based view 
is modeled this relationship by a link to form a network. Thus the network structure is our 
first priority to understand before we derive any theory on it. However, with the great 
complexity of the society, it is cumbersome and non-practical to understand the 
relationship of all agents we concerned. It is more desirable to model the network 
structure as random networks [10]. Since we aim to identify a network that bears the 
characteristic to provide a topology such that each specific-status agent is capable of 
spreading information to all other agents, we turn to random graph theory for a suitable 
topology. For example, the ER model [11], one of the most well-known random networks, 
suggests that each node pair in a network with total nodes N is connected with probability 
p independently in total (
𝑁
 
) pairs. The degree distribution of ER model is 
 
The information platform keep track of every agents’ decision result of the same 
issue and publish such information to those on the same information platform. For 
example, the YouTube display users’ comment and rating of the film and the e-commerce, 
such as Yahoo or eBay , records every comment of the seller and consumer. The decision 
maker accesses such information as observation easily and makes a decision based on it. 
 
information for the decision maker in the future. Such an interaction is described by 
    [0 1], which is the probability that agent i’s choice is the decision that agent j took. 
In addition, let us allow for a probability, denoted   
    , that agent i decides on x 
independently when    is true. Letting  𝑟      1    . . .    −      denote the 
probability that    = 1 given other agents’ decision and    is true, it follows that 
 
Likewise, we also have 
 
This framework allows an individual’s decision to depend on arbitrary 
neighborhoods of others, placing varying weights on different agents. Correspondingly, 
the process becomes a bit more cumbersome to deal with as we now need to keep 
tracking of each agent’s decision in each period, rather than just an aggregated 
statistic.Now we take more in-depth consideration about    . For simplicity, let    𝑗  
symbolize that agent i has a connection to agent j, and      𝑗  symbolize {agent i 
follows agent j’s decision}. Thus 
 
Denote      𝑟       𝑗   and      𝑟       𝑗       𝑗   in brief. We discover that 
the correlation between    is the consequence of social network structure,     and the 
relation among every agents,    , respectively. Now we consider the joint probability 
density function of observations for the decision center. 
 
where     =        . Define following terms 
B. Supply and Demand Functions 
 
1) Supply Function of Service Providers: 
Each SP provides extra bandwidth to other SPs’ LUs based on the satisfaction of its 
LUs for its allocated bandwidth. Therefore, the profit function of the      is from the 
satisfaction of its local connections for their allocated bandwidth    , price per bandwidth 
   from the connections of other SPs’ LUs while they utilize the allocated bandwidth     
and     and the roaming rate per bandwidth 𝑟  while its LUs leverage other SPs’ 
bandwidth     and    . Therefore, the profit function of the      is formulated as 
 
where     𝑚 is the total allocated bandwidth to its mth local connection,     𝑚 and     𝑚 
are the total allocated bandwidth to the mth connections of the     ’s LUs and the     ’s 
LUs respectively,    is the price per bandwidth for the connections of the the     ’s LUs 
and the     ’s LUs, r is the roaming rate per bandwidth for its LUs when they leverage 
other SPs’ bandwidth, where   𝑗     1     and    𝑗   . The supply function of the 
     is obtained by differentiating Eq.(2) with     and is given by 
 
where   𝑗     1     and    𝑗   . Therefore, the supply function of the SPi for the 
connections of other SPs’ LUs is given by 
 
where     1    . 
 
2) Demand Function of Licensed Users (LUs): 
The SPi provides extra bandwidth to the connections of other SPs’ LUs in its 
coverage area. We define the payoff function of the     ’s connections of other SPs’ LUs 
and 
 
respectively, where i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 and i _= j _= k. With the same derivation above, we 
generalize the equilibrium of the allocated bandwidth and the price in a heterogeneous 
WN with n WNs belonging n different SPs, which are given by 
 
and 
 
respectively, where i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, i _= j and n ≥ 3. 
From the above, we observe that the SPi’s demand of other SPs’ LUs decreases with 
the increasing value of r and approaches zero while r approaches ∞, which is given by. 
 
In other works, each LU has no incentives for the cooperative sharing scheme when the 
value of r is extremely high. Therefore, a suitable value of r is important for the 
cooperative spectrum sharing scheme. 
 
VI.3.5 Part 5: Connectivity of Multiple Cooperative Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc 
Networks 
A. Network Model 
 
  We construct the network model by Poisson Point Process (PPP). A pair of nodes are 
connected in the networks if the capacity of the channel between them can support the 
information rate R. By the mapping theorem [11], the degree distribution of a typical 
node is Poisson distributed with mean: 
 
secondary network I, and    
𝑎   is the active probability of an SU in secondary network i. 
 
 
 
VI.4 Result and Discussion 
VI.4.1 Part 1: Network Synchronization Among Femtocells 
The proposed network synchronization algorithm achieves a successful 
synchronization among all femtocells overlaying the Macrocell under following critical 
constraints in the LTE-Advanced femtcoells architecture: (i) Each  HeNB only utilizes 
existing synchronization signals broadcasted by the eNB of the  Macrocell or neighboring 
HeNB. Therefore, there is no impact on the existing femtcoells architecture in LTE-
Advanced. (ii) For a HeNB that can not synchronize to  the Macrocell, the knowledge of 
which its neighboring HeNB can synchronize to the Macrocell is not required. (iii) Even 
though none of femtocells can successfully synchronize to the Macrocell, the 
synchronization among all femtocells can also be achieved. (iv) The proposed algorithm 
yields an extreme low computational complexity. 
 
A. Some HeNBs with a Successful Synchronization to the Macrocell 
In Fig. 2 we show timing dynamics of 𝑀  9  femtocells among which one 
femtocell can successfully synchronize to the Macrocell (denoted by the first femtocell). 
We can observe from Fig. 2 that all timings of 8 femtocells that can not successfully 
synchronize to the Macrocell align to the timing of the femtocell with the successful 
synchronization to the Macrocell in  s . This result suggests the effectiveness of the 
proposed network synchronization algorithm. In Fig. 3, we investigate timing dynamics 
of M=9 femtocells among which two femtocells can  successfully synchronize to the 
Macrocell. We can observe from Fig. 3 that the more the femtocells can successfully 
synchronize to the Macrocell, the faster timings of other femtocells converge to the 
timing of the Macrocell.  
 
These results follow our analysis of the convergence rate in Theorem 2.

B. None of HeNBs with Successful Synchronization with the Macrocell 
In this subsection, we evaluate another merit of the proposed network synchronization 
algorithm under the condition that none of femtocells can successfully synchronize to the 
Macrocell. Fig. 6 shows timing dynamics of 9 femtocells and none of these 9 femtocells 
can successfully synchronize to the Macrocell. We can observe from Fig. 6 that all these

VI.4.2 Part 2: Time Synchronization in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks 
A. Influence  of  Network  Topology  on  the  Improved  Voter Algorithms 
 
Definition 2.  For a graph          , if each node in the graph has equal connecting 
probability (and positive) to every node, the graph (network) is equally connectible, 
otherwise it is unequally connectible. And if every node has a positive probability 
connecting to some fraction (not all) of nodes in the network, the network is partially 
connectible. 
 
With this definition in mind, we categorize some common network models as follows. 
• Equally connectible : ER networks 
• Unequally  connectible :  Small-world  networks, Scale-free networks 
• Partially connectible : Random geometric graphs, Lattice networks 
 
 
with memory threshold K = 1, 2 is plotted in Fig. 5. The average convergence time on ER 
and small-world networks are near to each other, and slightly raises as K increases. In 
random geometric graph,  the average convergence time grows rapidly when initial 
density approaches 0.5. This phenomenon results from the partially connectible 
characteristic, when the state-0 nodes form a cluster by chance, they are hard to be 
broken since every node can only reach the nodes nearby, this effect becomes worse as K 
gets large. Above results show that the performance of the improved voter algorithm 
mainly depends on whether the topology is partially connectible. The performance of our 
algorithm is not ideal in partially connectible networks, and is much better in both 
equally and unequally connectible networks. 
 
B. Influence  of  Network  Size  on  the  Improved  Voter Algorithms 
 
Definition 3. We define the partially connectible level as the fraction of nodes in G = (V, 
E) such that for each node in G has positive probability connecting to. With this 
definition, the partially connectible level of equally and unequally connectible networks 
are equal to 1. 
 
Theorem 1. The order of partially connectible level of random geometric graph with 
transmission radius r  √
2𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁
𝑁
, is equal to Θ 
logN
N
 . 
 
The growth of network size has no influence on the connectible characteristic  of 
equally and unequally connectible networks. In Fig. 6, the convergence time of  ER 
networks with three different network sizes behave similarly, the growth of  convergence 
time is steady. But in partially connectible networks, as network size N becomes large, 
the partially connectible level decreases, then increases the chance to  form a cluster, also 
results in the rapid increasing of convergence time when initial density approaches 0.5 in 
Fig. 7. It shows that the convergence time grows steady with increasing network size, if 
we can avoid the forming of cluster.

C. Application: Time Synchronization Among Femtocells 
In IMT-Advanced, the femtocells have been considered as critical technology to 
deploy high data rate mobile communications. The femtocells are likely placed in  the 
indoor environment to extend the signal coverage that cannot be well covered by 
Macrocells. To mitigate the cross-tier interference among Macrocells and femtocells, or 
the intra-tier interference among femtocells, the timing of the Macrocell and all 
femtocells must be synchronized. There are some existing algorithms that ensure the 
synchronization among femtocells. Such as [14], it uses the synchronization signal 
broadcasted by Macrocell and femtocell. The femtocell which can receive from  
Macrocell follows the timing of Macrocell. For other femtocells, they receive some 
synchronization signals, and update their timing by the convex combination of  received 
timings, the synchronization among femtocells will finally be reached. But we find some 
problems in the existing algorithm, if in a well-synchronized  femtocell network, there is 
any clock of femtocells becomes malfunctioned (for example, run abnormally fast or 
slow), then the error of timing will spread to the whole network gradually and makes the 
network unable to be synchronized anymore. We define the femtocell is synchronized if 
the timing difference between its and Macrocell’s is within a given threshold ε . Then we 
  
 
Fig. 10 shows an example of femtocell deployment with DR= 0.3, and the 
apartments within Macrocell’s coverage are filled with color yellow. We simulate the 
performance of our algorithm by averaging 5000 times simulation results on DR= 0.3 and 
0.7 cases.

In Fig. 11, the difference of average timing between our algorithm and the two 
others grows with time. Although the growing speed become relatively slower after about 
t = 100, but it still cannot reach a steady state since that there are only few femtocells can 
synchronized to the correct timing. In our algorithm, the error timing should be corrected 
twice of samplings, which averagely equals to 
2 seconds. Thus the error timing grows to 0.02 second then be corrected, it then stays  at 
0.01 second in average. The number 0.01 is averaged by the number of femtocells,  the 
inferred average timing is 8.  × 10–4 second, which is in agreement with the simulation 
  
 
VI.4.3 Part 3: Connectivity of Multiple Cooperative Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc 
Networks  
In the previous section, we construct network model to describe the interative 
scheme of primary networks (PNs) and secondary networks (SNs) and deduce the 
condition for the phase transition. In this section, we conclude the main results in our 
theses.  
The network users are distributed according to PPPs (Poisson Point Processes). 
And by mapping theorem, the estimation of connectable neighbors becomes a calculation 
of Possion distribution. Also, in order to maintain the Qos of the primary users, there is 
an active probability of secondary users. The result is that in a two SNs scheme, an SN 
percolates if and only if the following condition be satisfied: 
 
In a more general set up, where there are M heterogeneous secondary netowrks, the 
closed form formula becomes: 
 
We see that with this simple formula, a quick test can be easily perform to see whether 
networks can benefit from cooperation.  
In the following figures we compare the systems with and without cooperation: 
irrelevant term on the inferring of H. Thus the worse case for decision is the least-
favorable density with the most complicated correlation characterized by the social 
network structure. 
 
A. Random Network Structure  
 
On considering the social network structure, we take place on a configuration model 
of network with degree distribution   . There are two possible status of the link: either 
the link in question can be unoccupied (with probability 1 −  ), or it is occupied (with 
probability  ). Then the existence of leastfavorable density is derived by the analysis of 
percolation [14], which originates from statistical mechanics, and is used in analysis of 
random network dynamics. 
 
Proposition 1. (Percolation) The percolation probability,      is the probability that a 
given vertex belongs to an infinite open cluster. There exists a critical probability 
(percolation threshold)    such that 
 
where 
 
 
B. Small-world Networks 
 
It has been shown that the social network structure is properly described in small-
world graph model in the late 1960s [16] [17]. This result has been confirmed by 
subsequent studies and is now widely believed to be meaningful. Networks showing 
the ”small-world” effect, where the number of ”degree separation” between any two 
agents of a given population is mall by comparison with the size of the population itself, 
show much correlation between their action and decisions. 
Considering a one-dimensional small-world graph as in Fig 2. L agents are arranged 
on a one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions and links connect all pairs 
of agents which are separated by a distance of k or less. (For simplicity we have selected 
k = 1 in the figure.) Shortcuts are now added between randomly chosen pairs of agents. 
Different from the case of random network model, in smallworld graph model, there 
VI.4.5 Part 5: Cooperative Spectrum Sharing Economy for Heterogeneous 
Wireless Networks 
We use backward induction to obtain an optimal roaming rate based on the 
equilibrium in our proposed market model. If all SPs attempt to maximize the social 
welfare (i.e., sum of payoff functions) of all LUs, the optimal roaming rate would be zero. 
However, each SP could not gain extra revenue when its LUs leverage other SPs’ 
bandwidth. If all SPs attempts to maximize their profit, the optimal roaming rate would 
approach infinity. However, the LUs’ demand for other SPs’ bandwidth is zero from 
Eq.(16). In other words, each LU has no incentives to leverage other SPs’ bandwidth due 
to extreme high cost. Therefore, in order to ensure that all SPs and all LUs have 
satisfactory incentives for this cooperative spectrum sharing scheme, the optimal 𝑟∗ 
maximizes the overall social welfare of all SPs and all LUs. The problem is formulated as 
 
where  𝑠   and      are defined in Eq.(2) and Eq.(5) respectively. We obtain the optimal 
solution 𝑟∗  by gradient ascent method with low complexity due to the fact that the 
optimization problem is a nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem [15]. 
 
 
A. Iterative Algorithm 
We adopt gradient ascent method to obtain the optimal roaming rate r∗. Due to only 
one variable r in this optimization problem, the iterative algorithm of gradient ascent 
method is the first order gradient ascent and given by

VI.5 Summary 
VI.5.1 Part 1: Network Synchronization Among Femtocells 
In this paper, we resolve the critical issue on the network synchronization among 
femtocells. We proposed network synchronization algorithm that enables all femtocells to 
synchronize with and without the present of the Macrocell. The benefit of our algorithm 
is two folded: on the one hand, it has very limited computational complexity. Secondly, it 
imposes no impacts on the system architecture of the existing femtocell architecture in 
3GPP. As a result, our algorithm can be smoothly applied to LTE-Advanced femtocell to 
serve urgent needs of the standardization progress in 3GPP. 
 
VI.5.2 Part 2: Time Synchronization in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks 
Based on our previous work, an improved voter algorithm is proposed to handle the 
time synchronization in heterogeneous networks. This algorithm reduces the error 
probability by 90% and the convergence time by 80% compared to the original voter 
algorithm. We propose a multi-hop sampling mechanism, which improves the 
convergence time of our algorithm in partially connectible networks. We show that our 
algorithm can be practicably applied to realistic network applications at the end of this 
cooperation is indeed beneficial to each secondary network in the sense that percolation 
happens more frequently. Our result can be used as a quick test about whether 
cooperation could exist in a heterogeneous network.

在技術創新方面: 
Several innovative techniques proposed in this project will be presented below:
(1) We propose a novel robust information fusion method that makes decision in 
a social network with uncertainly more reliable. Moreover, our fusion method is 
shown to be able to prevent the network from disruption even under poor detection 
capability and fragile nature of social networks. 
(2) We propose a network synchronization algorithm which can smoothly applied to 
LTE-Advanced femtocells to solve the critical issue of network synchronization 
among them. To our best knowledge, our work is the first to address this problem 
with practical consideration of 4G system specification and limitation defined 
by IMT-Advanced. 
在經濟效益方面: 
Cognition and decision plays an important role in social network. However, the 
precise mathematical model of decision and thus applications based on the presence 
of uncertainty in social network has not been satisfactorily established yet. Our 
work addresses this problem and is shown to succeed in providing reliable decision 
making under constraints such as unreliable data collection and malicious attack. 
Our work can thus be transferred or licensed to Taiwanese software and IT service
