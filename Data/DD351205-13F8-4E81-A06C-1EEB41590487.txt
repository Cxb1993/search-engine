satisfy the following requirements at the same time: (1) to be optically transparent to light 
in the visible region of the spectrum; (2) to be impervious to moisture, and (3) to be 
sufficiently stable to withstand the manufacturing thermal processes with high 
temperatures up to 300℃ . 
Because of rapid advancement in the microelectronic industry, the enhanced 
performance of tightly packed circuitry has become an increasingly relevant issue. 
Decreasing the dielectric constant while maintaining thermal and mechanical properties 
of the thin film interlayer dielectric materials [16,17] is highly desirable. Fluorine 
containing polymers [10,18,19] are of special interest because of their possible use as gas 
selective membranes and their enhanced flame resistance, low dielectric constant, and 
remarkably low water absorption. The trifluoromethyl groups in the polymer backbone 
enhance polymer solubility without any forfeiture of thermal stability. They also increase 
the glass transition temperature with a concomitant decrease of crystallinity. This bulky 
group also serves to increase various properties of polymers, including gas permeabilities 
[12] and electrical insulating properties. Because of all these interesting properties of the 
fluorinated polymers, considerable attention has been devoted to the preparation of new 
classes of fluorine-containing polymers.  
In this paper, we report the successful synthesis of the bisfluoro monomers shown 
in Scheme I via a Suzuki coupling [20,21] and subsequent utilization of these monomers 
in a nucleophilic aromatic substitution polymerization with different bisphenols [12,22-
24], as well as their characterization.

benzophenone and distilled in an argon atmosphere before use. Toluene was dried over 
CaH and then distilled in an argon atmosphere and deoxygenated by purging with argon 
for 30 min before its use in monomer synthesis. Bisphenols 4,4'-dihydroxybiphenyl, 4,4'-
(1-methylethylidenelbisphenol (BPA), 4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bisphenol (6F 
BPA) and 9,9'-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. 
and used without further purification. All polymerizations were conducted using standard 
vacuum-line techniques and, in order to remove the water produced by the reaction, a 
slow stream of argon was passed through the reaction vessel during the course of 
polymerization. 
2.3. Monomer Synthesis 
For successful preparation of PAEs via nucleophilic displacement reactions of 
dihalo compounds with alkali-metal bisphenolates, the corresponding monomers 7-9 and 
bisphenols a-h have to be prepared in large quantities to obtain good yields (scheme I). 
While some bisphenols were already known and described in the literature, [2, 6, 22] the 
synthetic procedures for the other monomers are provided below. Self-coupling [19] of 4-
bromobenzyl bromides with catalyst Fe(CO)5 and phase transfer reagent Bu4NBr in an 
alkali aqueous solution accomplished 1 in fair yield, which were cyclolized after re-
crystallization without further characterization.  Cyclolization of 1 with benzil in a 
solvent mixture of triethylene glycol, benzyltrimethyl ammonium hydroxide, and 
methanol gave 2 in fair to good yield. Diels-Alder reactions [25] of cyclopentadienone 2 
were carried out with 1.1 equivalent moles of cyclodiene or acetylenes in dry diphenyl 
ether, which furnished six-member ring precursors 3-5 in good to excellent yields. 
Couple reactions of compounds 3-5 were carried out using Suzuki reactions with 2.3 
 6 
apparatus fitted with a condenser, and a nitrogen inlet. The flask was charged with 
monomers 7-9 (0.9 mmol), bisphenol monomers a-h (0.9 mmol), potassium carbonate 
(1.8 mmol ), NMP (8 ml ) and toluene( 15 ml). The solution mixture was then stirred at 
130-150°C for several hours, and, during the course of the reaction, a slow stream of 
nitrogen was passed through the reaction vessel to remove the water produced by the 
reaction and then azeotroped with toluene. After all the water had been removed, the 
reaction solution was stirred under reflux (165 °C) for 8 h. The resultant polymer solution 
was diluted with 8ml of THF. The diluted solution was poured into a stirred methanol 
(250 ml) and the fibrous polymer was precipitated in situ. The precipitated polymers 10-
12 were collected by filtration and washed with 10% HCl and H2O and then vacuum-
dried until no solvent was detected in the TGA experiment. For yields and molecular 
masses, see Table 1. 
3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 NMR Spectroscopy  
Typical spectroscopic data from 19F and 1H, and 13C NMR spectroscopy are 
shown in Figures 1 and 2, and support the structures of the bisfluoro monomer 8 and 
polymer 11h, respectively. The 19F NMR spectrum (Figure 1) of the bisfluoro monomer 8 
shows two peaks at the chemical shifts of – 62.3 and –118.5 ppm of equal intensity, 
attributed to the fluorines of the trifluoromethyl groups and of the bisfluoro groups, 
respectively. After polymerization, the corresponding 19F NMR spectrum of the polymer 
11h is shown in Figure 2 and presents only a peak at – 62.8 ppm attributed to the 
trifluoromethyl groups, while the signal at –118.5 ppm caused from the bisfluoro groups 
of the monomer 8 completely disappear due to nucleophilic displacement of the fluorine 
 8 
other polymers were only swelled by this solvent.  
3.4 Thermal Properties  
The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated using 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The 
TGA thermograms for 12a-h are shown in Figure 3. The polymers were stable up from 
436 to 668℃ in nitrogen atmospheres (Table 3). Based on bisphenols’ structures, the 
polymers could be briefly classified into three categories. The first category, polymers 
12b and 12f having almost fully aromatic main chain, show only one decomposition 
process, starting at about 600°C with char residues of 70 and 59% at 800°C, which was 
attributed to the degradation of the main chain. In polymers 12g and 12h, the second 
category, possessing small pendent groups of methyl or trifluoromethyl attached to the 
main chain also show one decomposition process; however, it starts at about 500°C with 
char residues of 34 and 31% at 800°C.  The third category, polymers 12a, 12c, 12d and 
12e having the bulky pendent groups of alkyl cyclics attached to the main chain indicate 
two decomposition processes for each of the four polymers. The first process, starting at 
about 435°C with weight losses of 12, 24, 21 and 15% for 12a, 12c, 12d and 12e, 
respectively, was attributed to the degradation of the alkyl cyclics. The second process, 
starting at about 550°C with char residues of 24, 22, 21 and 56% at 800°C for 12a, 12c, 
12d and 12e, respectively, was attributed to the degradation of the main chain. The high 
thermal stability of these polymers was confirmed by the high char residues reported in 
Table 3. The lowest initial thermal degradation temperature of about 435°C was well 
above the highest temperature (350°C) used in DSC experiments; furthermore the 
samples were solvent-free within the TGA limits of detection. This guarantees that no 
 10 
On the other hand, when comparing Tg values (shown in Figure 5) in different 
bisfluoro monomer structures, it was predicted and confirmed that all the tetraphenyl-
substituted polymers 12a-h would have highest Tg values followed by triphenyl-
substituted polymers 11a-h, and then diphenyl-substituted polymers 10a-h due to a 
gradual decrease in number of substituents on middle phenylene, which causes less 
restriction for rotating the substituents along the polymer backbone. 
In addition, Table 3 tells that the Tg’s of 2,2-adamatane PAEs 10-12a are much 
higher than those of 1,3-adamatane PAEs 10-12d. Due to the phenyl rings are connected 
to the same carbon atom the 2,2-adamatane PAEs are thus easier to form a 60o gauche 
conformation, and therefore results in a increased energy barrier for rotating the 2,2-
adamantane pendent group along the main chain. That is to say that the adamantane rings 
of the 1,3-isomers are relatively free to rotate along the main polymer chain, while those 
2,2-isomers are constrained in their relative position and rotational freedom by steric 
interactions. This imparts an increase in Tg by restricting segmental mobility, while 
providing good solubility due to decreased packing and increased free volume. 
Additionally, the main polymer chain based on the 2,2-isomer is more ‘kinked’ than for 
the 1,3-isomer because the phenyl rings are connected to the same carbon atom. Both 
effects influence the Tg of these polymers. The greater degree of conformational 
constraints in 2,2-adamantane PAEs is most likely responsible for the differences in 
physical properties of these PAEs based on isomers of adamantane bisphenol. Therefore, 
the difference in Tg values between polymers 10-12a and polymers 10-12d can be 
ascribed to the hindrance effect of the chain rotation in the adamantane-substituted 
polymers.  
 12 
electron delocalization along the chain as the side-groups changed from diphenyl-
substituted monomer 7 to triphenyl-substituted monomer 8, and tetraphenyl-substituted 
monomer 9. 
It should be noted that the wavelengths are shifted only by a small amount in 
conjunction with the number of substituents on the central phenylene ring, but the 
intensities are changed significantly as the numbers of substituent are altered. Upon 
comparing the absorption bands of monomer 8 and 9 with those of monomer 7, in both 
instances (monomer 8 and 9) the intensities are greatly shifted. Therefore, it may be that 
intensities are, in general, more sensitive to slight changes in the angle between the rings 
than they are to wavelengths. This also indicates that although there are three major 
absorption bands for each monomer, the number of excitons responsible for each 
absorption band varies substantially as the numbers of substituent are altered.  
A similar trend of blue shift is observed in corresponding polymer solutions as 
seen by comparing the absorption spectra of PAE10a-e (diphenyl-substituted) and 
PAE11a-e (triphenyl-substituted) to those of PAE12a-e (tetraphenyl-substituted) nearly 
independent of bisphenol monomers. However, the degrees of blue shift caused by 
substituted side-groups for polymers decrease, which indicates lesser reductions in the 
electron delocalization of the polymer main-chain, than that of monomers. From Table 5, 
it is clear that the UV absorption λmax of polymers becomes longer than that of 
corresponding monomers. In the sense of effective conjugation length, this indicates that 
it becomes longer after polymerization. On the other hand, however, the effect of twist 
between adjacent planes of the phenylene rings of the main chain, which varies with the 
number of side-chain substitutes of bisfluoromonomers, is reduced due to polymerization, 
 14 
the substituents, which affected the torsion angle and the relative movement of the phenyl 
rings. Therefore, we tentatively conclude that the emission spectrum is characterized by 
effective conjugation length which could be manipulated by the size and number of the 
substituents. 
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of PAE10-12e thin films are shown in 
Figure 8.  For all three PAEs, the PL spectra consist three major emission bands. The 
emission bands with shortest wavelength in each spectrum possess small Stokes shifts of 
35-48 nm, which is characteristic of   isolated chain emission as seen in dilute solutions. 
In addition to isolated chain emission, all other bands have large Stokes shifts of 122-176 
nm between the emission λmax and the absorption onset, which is characteristic of 
aggregate or excimer emission of solid films of many conjugated polymers. [28] 
Interestingly, the emission bands at longer wavelength of polymers 11e and 10e show not 
only broad and featureless but also relatively low in intensity, which is characteristic of 
excimers. In contrast, compared to PAE 10e and 11e the PAE12e with four substituents 
has relatively high emission intensity for longer wavelength bands due to a more twisted 
structure and relatively large intermolecular distances. We therefore conclude that the 
solid-state emission of the PAE10-11e originates from excimers; however, the emission 
band of PAE12e is tentatively assigned to emission from intermolecular aggregates in 
view of their relatively high emission intensity. 
4. Conclusion 
A new class of high-temperature, high-Tg polymers, the poly(ary1ene ether)s, 
have been synthesized via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of bisfluoro- 
pentaphenyl monomers with bisphenolates generating the arylene ether linkages. The
