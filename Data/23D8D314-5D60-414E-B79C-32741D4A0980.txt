Wave breaking is an important subject for geophysical science, oceanography, ocean, coastal, 
environmental and ecological engineering. Wave breaking process is too difficult to be resolved 
by theoretical analysis due to the complex mixing of water and air-bubble. Although the 
distribution of turbulent kinetic energy density can be roughly modeled by numerical simulation, 
the magnitude of turbulent intensity and underlining mechanism were not be modeled 
appropriately. Consequently, experimental studies were conducted in a wave flume at Tainan 
Hydraulics Laboratory, National Cheng Kung University. We improved measurement techniques 
and developed a new integrated measurement system. The ensemble average method was used 
for turbulence decomposition. The whole column of oscillating flow velocities were measured 
over entire surf zone. The distributions of turbulent intensity generated by breaking waves and 
evolution of turbulence were revealed coherently. The velocity profiles, vorticity field, and 
streamlines topography of ensemble-averaged flow were investigated. The turbulence intensity, 
Reynolds stress and turbulence production, convection, dissipation and diffusion were also 
studied as well. We also investigate the total energy dissipation and turbulence dissipation of 
breaking wave in surf zone. In addition, the characteristics of surf-zone wave boundary were 
studied.

Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). For instance, Stive (1980) applied LDV to measure the 
internal flow structure and the turbulence for periodic spilling breakers. Nadaoka and Kondoh 
(1982) also used this technique to evaluate the maximum and minimum turbulence intensities 
under breaking waves. Ting and Kirby (1994; 1995; 1996) examined the undertow and 
turbulence transport for plunging and spilling breakers. De Serio and Mossa (2006) measured the 
Reynolds stress in the shoaling region and turbulence in the breaking region. Shin and Cox (2006) 
estimate the turbulent intensity in the inner surf zone and swash zone. Although hot-film, ADV 
and LDV provide high sampling data rate, they are a single point measuring technique. It is 
difficult to provide physical information in spatial domain. Additionally, measurements of 
hot-film and LDV are usually restricted below the wave trough (above studies) due to the failure 
of these technique in aerated region of breaking waves. Recently, the transition of vortical 
structures of weakly plunging breakers was studied by Stansby and Feng (2005) through a 
extension of the LDV measurement to crest region. However, to investigate the spatial flow 
structures with LDV, the temporal velocities are under an assumption that breaking wave are 
slowly varying from the temporal to spatial domain and the spatial derivatives should be 
estimated through the Taylor hypothesis ( / ( / )t C x∂ ∂ = − ∂ ∂ ). This assumption would be 
inappropriate for analysis of the turbulent energy transport in the surf zone because that the 
turbulent fluctuations are not small compared to the mean flow (Kimmoun and Branger, 2007; 
Ting and Kirby, 1995).  
In recent years, PIV has been frequently used for flow measurement due to its full-field map 
of velocity. An exhaustive guide to the development of PIV system and its applications to water 
waves can be respectively found in Raffel (1998) and Grue et al. (2003). PIV was applied for 
measurement of breaking wave in deep water (e.g. Dabiri and Gharib, 1997; Melville et al., 2002; 
Qiao and Duncan, 2001). Additionally, Chang and Liu (1999) investigated the turbulent energy 
budget of breaking waves in an intermediate constant water depth. Cox and Anderson (2001), 
Son and Kihm (2001) and Watanabe et al. (2006) measured the oblique descending eddies in 
spanwise-horizontal plane on slopes with PIV. Govender et al. (2002b) applied digital correlation 
image velocimetry for the measurement of the roller geometries and turbulent intensity fields at 
three positions in the surf zone. Although PIV is a more effective flow measurement technique 
than LDV, the spatial resolution and frame rate are still limited such that it is not satisfactory for 
the research of breaking waves. The flow structures induced by breaking wave evolve across the 
surf zone. It is difficult to reveal the flow evolution from a local fixed measurement of PIV. To 
understand the flow evolution, the PIV measurements should be integrated from several different 
positions as given by Qiao and Duncan (2001), Melville et al. (2002) and Kimmoun and Branger 
(2007).  
LDV provides an excellent measurement of turbulences; however, it is impossible to 
investigate the spatial flow evolution using a point-measuring instrument, especially for 
determination of spatial gradient-based quantities, such as vorticity. Except for the numerical 
simulation, spatial transitions of physical processes under breaking wave in the surf zone, as well 
as quantitative experimental evidences have rarely been observed. The transition of the flow of a 
spilling wave across the surf zone is investigated experimentally by PIV. Several techniques such 
as the mosaic of image frames, image processing, and ensemble-average method were also used 
to perform the measurements and data analysis effectively. The temporal and spatial distributions

According to Battjes (1974), these conditions correspond to a surf similarity parameter 
0tan / /bH Lβ =0.327, where tan β  is the bottom slope and L0 is the deep-water wavelength 
and the breaker is a spilling type.

Data analysis 
The velocity field was calculated based on the FFT-Correlation and three-point Gaussian 
peak algorithms in TSI’s Insight (also used by Hambleton et al., 2006). Each pair of images was 
processed from an interrogation window size of 32× 32 pixels using 50% overlap (Raffel et al., 
1998). During the calculation, a zero-padding-mask was used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. 
The velocity field gave a spatial resolution of 1.21× 1.21 mm2. The spacing of velocities is 
smaller than the turbulence length scale, under the range of 0.04-0.18 times of  local mean 
water depth (Cox et al., 1994). A global range filter was used to remove vectors with velocity 
values outside of the set range (about ±1 ms-1). Next, a local median filter (3× 3 vectors) was 
employed to remove spurious vectors by comparing each velocity vector to the median value of 
the surrounding neighboring vectors. The missing velocities were interpolated with the mean 
value of 3× 3 neighborhood velocities.

considered. If the moving-average or phase-average method is employed, the variation will affect 
the accuracy of averaging results (Chang and Liu, 1999). Accordingly, the ensemble-average 
method is applied by repeating the same experiments for twenty five runs at each FOV. As many 
as 175 test runs were conducted and 17500 velocity fields were calculated for the global 
representation of physical quantities integrated from seven FOVs.  
The ensemble-averaged mean velocity, ju , is defined by

N =

where uj is the measured j-component velocity, the symbol  represents the ensemble 
average , p denotes the pth experiment, and N is the total repeating number of experiments. The 
measured turbulent component of the flow is then defined as  
 j j ju u u′ = −   (2) 
where ju′  denotes the velocity fluctuations. Since only two velocity components are measured, 
the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is defined as  
 1.33 1.33

k k u u w w′ ′ ′ ′ ′= = +  (3) 
where k is the turbulent kinetic energy, k ′  is the instantaneous value of k , u′ and w′ are the 
velocity fluctuation in the x and z directions, and the coefficient 1.33 is obtained from the 
assumption that breaking waves have characteristics similar to that of the plane wake (Svendsen, 
1987). The 3-dimensional turbulence kinetic energy density can be estimated well from the 
two-dimensional measurement by using such a coefficient (Christensen, 2006). Presumably, the 
mean velocity field is convergent as N → ∞. In practice, the mean flow reaches a convergent state 
after the experiment is repeated a sufficient number of times. Convergence statistics of the 
measured velocities and TKE were tested at crest region under breaking phase. Relative errors of 
u and k  at a data point are given by

Five points, located in the crest region under breaking phase, are used to test the convergence 
of the absolute error of ensemble-averaged results. Fig. 4 shows that the variation of NdV  were < 
0.05 for 12N ≥ . The variations of Ndk  were < 0.07 for 17N ≥  and < 0.05 for 20N ≥ . These 
figures also indicate that the error decreases and converges faster at the lower measuring point. All 
averaging results in this study were computed using N>20, confirming that it is sufficient to

between the two experiments and the underlying mechanisms might not be the same, the 
distinctive surface structures imply the effect of surface tension (Duncan, 2001; Qiao and 
Duncan, 2001). Next, the water body of the bulge starts slipping downstream accompanying the 
movement of the toe as shown in Fig. 5 (b). The initial stage of the breaking process is 
characterized as the incipience of wave breaking in the outer surf zone (x ≈ 0~150mm, 
t/T≈0~0.1). Then, the water mixes with few bubbles at the top front face of the wave as shown 
in Fig. 5 (c). The beginning of the bubble mixing is characterized as a bore established region 
(x≈150~250mm, t/T≈0.2~0.3). No splash-up or rebounding jet produced in a plunging breaker 
was observed. After, the bubble-mixing continues at the front of the bore and the wave shape 
changes slowly during the bore propagation in the inner surf zone (x ≈ 250~740mm, 
t/T≈0.4~0.9). 
Fig. 6 shows the overall temporal and spatial distributions of the ensemble-averaged 
velocities, where the velocity vectors are displayed every two points for clarity. The PIV 
measurements well extend to the crest region and cover a wide range across the surf zone by the 
mosaic of image frames. It also shows some evidence of the vertical boundaries of the tiles for 
constructing this mosaic especially when the wave crest is under the joints. Results manifest that 
the measured maximum velocity in the outer surf zone occurs at the head of wave crest, the 
‘roller’ region. The measured ensemble-averaged fluid particle velocity at the ‘roller’ region is 
0.82C (C is the local phase speed and is ~70 ms-1 in the outer surf zone). This can also be seen in 
Fig. 11. The measured value confirms the numerical result reported by Lin and Liu (1998). It is 
smaller than the velocity of an overturning jet of a plunging breaker which is as large as 1.5C 
(Chang and Liu, 1998). As the wave propagates into the inner surf zone, the magnitude of the 
velocities (can also be seen in Fig. 11) in the crest of bore region have similar values of 0.5C (the 
values of C range from 0.7 to 0.54 ms-1 across the surf zone), which agrees with the extrapolated 
result of Stive(1980).

velocity profiles in the inner zone are more non-uniform than those in the outer surf zone. High 
velocity gradient is found in the profile of crest region in the inner surf zone. A velocity deficit is 
also observed in the lower part of the profile in the inner surf zone. Since stronger turbulences 
and eddies are generated successively in the crest region in the inner surf zone, high momentum 
exchange from the mean flow to turbulence occurs. This will lead to the variation of the velocity 
profile from the outer to inner surf zones.  
Fig. 8 shows the Froude scaled vertical distributions of the ensemble-averaged horizontal 
velocities under the wave crest phases in different locations of surf zone. After scaling, the 
velocity profiles under crests seem similar to each other in the inner surf zone. Recall that the 
inner surf zone has been regarded as a similarity region where the wave shape and characteristics 
of flow fields remain in a quasi-steady state (Lin and Liu, 1998; Peregrine, 1983; Peregrine and 
Svendsen, 1978). Herein, the similarity in the inner surf zone was examined quantitatively. Fig. 9 
shows a schematic profile of the free shear layer with the length and velocity scales, in which cu  
denotes the top horizontal velocity in the wave crest below the aerated region evaluated at cz , 
bu  is the near bottom horizontal velocity under the wave crest evaluated at bz . Because the 
shape of the scaled velocity profiles are similar, ( c bu u−  ) and the corresponding ( c bz z− ) are used 
as the characteristic scales. The dimensionless horizontal velocity profiles ( ) /( )c c bu u u u− −     
against the dimensionless length scale ( ) / ( )c c bz z z zξ = − − are plotted in Fig. 10 with a fitting

in which c1 = -7.6270, c2 = -2.0565, c3 = -0.7483, c4 = -0.07619. The R2 value of this fitting 
curve is 0.977. The results show a surprisingly well behaved similarity among the wave-crest 
velocity profiles in the inner surf zone. Interestingly, this fitting curve is similar to the similarity 
profile of a separated shear layer induced by a vertical plate (Lin et al., 2005). The generation of 
vortexes and deficit of velocity of the flow may cause the similarity of velocity profiles between 
such different flow patterns.

passive material may congregate in. Feng and Stansby (2005) examined the streamline 
topographies by LDV. To investigate the spatial-dependent flow characteristics, the slowly 
varying wave assumption is needed in their analysis to convert temporal to temporal quantities 
(Feng and Stansby, 2005). This assumption may not be true for the cases that the turbulent 
fluctuations are not small compared to the mean flow. In this study, the global distributions of the 
streamline topographies measured by PIV, which are embedded on the contour maps of the 
velocity magnitudes are shown in Fig. 11. In the outer surf zone, the distribution of streamlines is 
similar to that of progressive wave (Dean and Dalrymple, 1991). The streamlines beneath the 
front face of wave crest (beneath filled arrows) become curved and non-uniform from the bore 
established region to inner surf zone, which is related to the generation of vortexes. The near-bed 
DSP beneath the front face of crest remains a DSP during wave propagation. The streamlines 
beneath the seaward face of crest (beneath the hollow arrows) change their direction during 
propagation. The streamline is 45 degree to the horizontal in the outer surf zone, but change to 
135 degree in the inner surf zone. On the other hand, the near-bed CSP beneath the seaward face 
of crest changes to a DSP. This may be related to the development of the reversed flow. These 
findings are the first time for revealing the evolution of the streamline structures of surf-zone 
breaking wave.

where u  and w  are the ensemble-averaged velocities in the x and z directions. The calculated 
vorticity fields, followed with a moving window to wave crest, are shown in Fig. 12. The 
vorticity fields were normalized by C/h (C is the local wave celerity and h is the local mean 
water depth) for comparison with previous results.  
At the beginning of wave breaking (t/T=0), a significant clockwise vortex (negative value) 
is formed near the toe of the roller. Such a vortex generated during incipient wave breaking was 
first found by Peregrine and Svendsen (1978). Then, extended vorticities appear at the front face 
of the wave crest accompanying the downward movement of the roller (t/T=1/10). Although no 
spilled jet and bubble entrainment occur during the incipient breaking process, vorticities are 
formed in a narrow layer near the front face of wave crest (Huang et al., 2006). Qiao and Duncan 
(2001) found the generation of vortices during the incipience of deep-water breaking process. To 
our knowledge, no literature has reported the incipient breaking process of gentle surf-zone 
progressing waves.  
Next, stronger vortexes are generated in the bore-established region due to a stronger 
mixing of the spilled water and bubbles (t/T=2/10). The intense vortexes are called ‘horizontal 
eddies’ because their rotational axis is horizontal (Nadaoka et al., 1989). The horizontal eddies 
are successively generated continually in the front face of bores during propagation 
(t/T=2/10~9/10). After the bore passes by, horizontal eddies diffuse and stretch gradually toward 
the irrotational region. Since there are no production mechanism in the interior region, the 
convection and diffusion are considered the dominate mechanisms to transport the vorticities 
from the crest to the interior region (Lin and Liu, 1998; Ting and Kirby, 1996; Zhao et al., 2004).  
Stansby and Feng (2005) found multiple horizontal eddies being elongated during bore 
propagation. The magnitudes of the maximum vorticity were 65 s-1 for plunging phase and 
reduce to 35 s-1 in the bore region. Chang and Liu (1999) found that vorticity generated by wave 
breaking was of the same order of magnitude as C/h. In the present measurement, the measured 
maximum vorticities from the bore established region to the inner surf zone are about 40~60 (s-1). 
The normalized maximum vorticities are ~2, which is of the order C/h as shown in Fig. 12. This 
is consistent with the results given by Chang and Liu(1999) and Kimmoun and Branger (2007).  
18 
Fig. 14 shows the global distributions of the TKE with color magnitude scale. In outer surf 
zone, significant TKE density is initially generated at the front head of the crest and the 
measured maximum value is 0.013 m2s-2 (0.027C2). Outside the head of the crest, the values of 
TKE are smaller than 0.0002 m2s-2. This manifests that the spilling process is a local phenomena 
and wave breaking only occurs locally in the head of crest (Lin and Liu, 1998; Peregrine, 1983). 
Then, stronger TKE densities are successively generated in the front face of the bore. The 
measured mean maximum value of TKE in the established bore region is 0.0265 m2s-2, which is 
~0.05 C2 (t/T=0.3). The turbulence continues to be generated during the bore propagation and is 
elongated to fill the whole wave crest. Multiple structures of TKE density can be identified in the 
crest region. The generation of turbulences in the front face of the bore is also related to the 
horizontal eddies. The measured maximum values of the TKE in the bore region are about 0.021 
m2s-2 (0.048 C2, t/T=0.6) and 0.016 m2s-2 (0.047 C2, t/T=0.8). It is found that the measured TKE 
in the crest region outside the foam zone is approximately in the order of magnitude of 0.05 C2 
from the established bore region to the inner surf zone. This corresponds to the turbulence 
similarity reported by Lin and Liu (1998), who found that the turbulence intensity at different 
vertical cross sections are similar with their magnitudes proportional to phase speed.

quantitative evolutionary evidence of the coherent turbulence structure can be observed at 
220 280mmx≤ ≤ during3/10 t/T 7 /10≤ ≤ . Fig. 15 shows an example of measured instantaneous 
velocity fields for the existence of oblique descending eddies. Clearly, vortexes beneath the 
seaward face of the bore stretch downward to the interior region with an angle of about 45° . 
Such stretched vortexes lead an rapidly intense and intermittent turbulent event as observed by 
Cox and Kobayashi (2000).  
The deforming direction and strength of the flow induced by breaking can be examined by 
the evaluations of the principal axes and strain rates of the velocity fields. The shear-strain tensor 
of a fluid element is expressed as

where the terms ( /u x∂ ∂  and /w z∂ ∂ ) are the volume dilation in x and z direction and the 
term ( / /w x u z∂ ∂ + ∂ ∂  ) is the shear deformation. The principal axes and strain rates are obtained 
through the calculations of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the shear-strain tensor. The 
calculated results are shown in Fig. 16, where the arrows represent the principal direction with 
lengths scaled to the magnitude of principal strain rates. Evidently, the flows in the interior 
regions beneath the front faces of the bore are intensely stretching downward at a direction about 
45° to the horizontal during bore propagation (t/T=3/10~6/10). This indicates that the initial 
downward development of the descending eddies should be related to the stretched flow field of 
the horizontal eddies generated in the front face of the bore. Remarkably, the principal directions 
are originally horizontal in the regions beneath the seaward face of the bore at t/T=3/10, but 
change to 45°  at t/T > 4/10. The changed directions in the interior regions are related to the 
stretched oblique descending eddies. The 45 °  principal direction is consistent with the findings 
reported by Nadaoka et al (1989) through LDV measurement. Present study provides more 
spatial quantitative evidences on the evolutionary distributions of deformation rates of the 
velocity fields. 
Fig. 17 is a contour map of the distribution of TKE extracted from Fig. 14. Clearly, three 
intense turbulent structures can be observed. Saddle points can also be recognized between two 
turbulent structures. From the above experimental evidence, it quantitatively confirms the 
findings observed by Nadaoka et al. (1989). The initial downward development of the 
descending eddies is related to the stretched flow field of the horizontal eddies generated in the 
front face of the bore. Then the eddies extend obliquely downward on a stretched flow field 
around the saddle point between the two adjacent turbulent horizontal eddies (cf. Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 
8 in Nadaoka et al., 1989; cf. Fig. 13 in Watanabe et al., 2005). Although Kimmoun and Branger 
(2007) also revealed the global distribution of the TKE, such a evolutionary downward stretched 
flow structure was not investigated. This study provides further experimental evidences for the 
evolution of turbulence quantities across the surf zone.

Conclusions 
In this study, we presented a novel experiment on the measurements of gentle breaking 
process of surf zone waves using PIV technique. The external analog trigger of wave gauge close 
to surf zone allows us to well control the measuring time of PIV. The overall distributions of the 
velocity fields and coherent turbulent structures in a continuous space-domain across the whole 
surf zone are examined through a mosaic of smaller PIV images in several fields of view. The 
mosaic technique provides an important advantage of finer resolution of velocity field.

Turbulence viscous dissipation caused by wave breaking has been considered a significant 
factor for dissipating the wave energy. During breaking process, the wave energy is converted 
into energy of mean current and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The TKE is damped through 
turbulence viscous dissipation by induced fluctuating eddies of breaking wave. The energy 
equation for the turbulence in tensorial notation reads (Tennekes and Lumley, 1972):

Turbulence models are frequently used for numerical simulations of breaking wave since 
directly solving the Navier-Stokes equation is difficult and time consuming. The k ε− (e.g. Lin 
and Liu, 1998) and k l−  (e.g. Zhao et al., 2004) (l is the length scale of turbulence) models are 
employed in the Reynolds- Averaged-Navier-Stokes models to simulate wave breaking in surf 
zone. Since the turbulence dissipation rate is difficult to be measured directly, several methods 
have been used to evaluate it with various degrees of assumptions. For example, the dissipation 
term under plunging breaking waves was estimated by Ting and Kirby (1995) using LDV by 
assuming the turbulence is isotropic. Chang and Liu (1999) and Melville et al. (2008) also 
estimated this quantity using PIV for breaking waves in constant water depths by the isotropic 
assumption:

capturing rate of the CCD (TSI, Powerview 2M, 1600×1200 pixels, 16-bits) was 30 frames per 
second (fps). A dual Nd:YAG laser system(120mJ/pulse, 30 Hz, 532 nm wavelength) was used to 
illuminate the measuring section. The light sheet was set at a distance 2.5 cm from the side wall, 
which is far enough away to avoid the wall effect. The PIV was set at 20 fps, yielding a PIV 
velocity field rate of 10 Hz. The water in the wave flume was seeded with nearly neutrally 
buoyant hollow spherical glass particles. The surface elevations were measured by five 
capacitance-type wave gauges with a sampling rate of 50 Hz. A schematic diagram of the 
facilities and apparatus layouts is illustrated in Fig.1.  
The global spatial distribution of velocities was integrated using a mosaic of image frames 
from seven fields of view. The width of the total measuring region was about 74cm, which is 
larger than one wavelength in the surf zone. An external analogy trigger with a threshold (fourth 
wave gauge) was set close to the surf zone for starting the measurement procedure of surface 
elevation in the data acquisition board. The PIV measurement was started after sending a TTL 
trigger generated from the data acquisition board into the synchronizer. The TTL trigger was 
generated with a given delay time to reflect a breaking phase at the first field of view. A sketch of 
the delay time of external trigger is illustrated in Fig. 22. Monochromatic waves with an incident 
wave period of 1.0 second and an incident wave height of 3.0cm were generated in the constant 
water depth. The breaking wave height, Hb, was 3.64cm at a still water depth of 4.8cm, which is 
defined as the origin of the x-direction. These conditions correspond to a surf similarity 
parameter 0tan / /bH Lβ =0.327, where tan β  is the bottom slope and L0 is the deep-water 
wavelength and the breaker is classified as a spilling type.  
Data analysis 
Each pair of images was processed by a Fast-Fourier-Transform-based cross-correlation 
method by an interrogation window size of 32×32 pixels using 50% overlap in TSI’s insight 
(also used by Hambleton et al., 2006). In the calculation process, a zero-padding-mask and a 
Gaussian peak algorithm was used to increase the efficacy. A global range filter (about ±1m/sec) 
and a local median filter (3× 3 vectors) was employed to remove spurious velocity vectors. The 
spatial resolution of velocity field was at 1.21×1.21mm2, which is smaller than the turbulence 
length scale determined by Cox et al. (1994). After applying a median filter (20×20 pixels) to 
remove the particle spots in the images, the free-surface boundaries were detected using a 
method proposed by Canny (1986). Due to the failure of PIV measurement in the aerated region, 
the area below the lower interface of the bubble-mixing region and above the bottom boundary is 
defined as the flow domain in this study. 
There are many methods to separate the mean flow and turbulent components (Longo et al., 
2002), such as the high-pass filtering, moving averaging, phase averaging (e.g. Ting and Kirby, 
1996; Cox and Kobayashi, 2000; Kimmoun and Branger, 2007), moving phase averaging (e.g. 
Nadaoka et al., 1989; Stansby and Feng, 2005), ensemble averaging (e.g. Chang and Liu, 1999, 
Melville et al., 2002), differencing method (Trowbridge, 1998; Scott et al., 2005) and so on. The 
phase averaging and moving phase averaging methods are usually applied. However, it is 
understood that each wave period and breaking location within a progressing wave train is 
slightly different in the surf zone even though the waves are generated monochromatically (so 
called long wave). The variation of wave breaking from wave to wave should be thus considered.

Results and discussions 
An advantage of present measurements is its ability to display the evolutionary process of 
the breaking wave both in temporal and spatial domains. Fig. 24 shows the measured 
ensemble-averaged velocity fields superimposed on the contour map of velocity magnitude, 
where the velocity vectors are displayed every four and three points both in the x and z directions 
for clarity. As can be seen, the measurements extended well to the crest region across the entire 
surf zone by the mosaic of image frames. During the course of wave breaking, both the wave 
height and flow velocities attenuate. This reflects energy dissipation in the surf zone. 
Additionally, the entire surf zone of this measurement is generally characterized by the 
incipience of wave breaking in the outer surf zone (x≈0~150mm, t/T≈0~1/10), bore-established 
region in the outer surf zone (x ≈ 150~250mm, t/T ≈ 2/10~3/10) and the inner surf zone 
(x≈250~740mm, t/T≈4/10~9/10). Fig. 25 presents the distribution of TKE density. High values 
of TKE are found in the crest above mean water surface elevation in the bore-established region.   
Turbulence dissipation rate 
Estimation of turbulence dissipation rate 
An example of the turbulence dissipation rate estimates based on different assumptions is 
presented in Fig. 25. In general, the plot shows that the value of this quantity increases from the 
bed and reaches a maximum at the top water column. It also indicates that stronger turbulence 
generation occurs in the crest region, where breaking is dominant. In addition, the estimates with 
isotropic assumption, Iε ,  and ‘Direct’ method, Dε , proposed by Doron et al.(2001) are the 
largest among these methods. This is due to their hypothesis that the lateral velocity fluctuation 
derivates are presumed to be of the same magnitude as streamwise component. In addition, Sε  
is the smallest since the lateral fluctuation derivates are assumed to be negligible. The variations 
among various estimates are larger in the crest region than those below the trough level. 
Nevertheless, their magnitudes appear to be of the same order. While the values in the crest 
region are about 0.01~0.02 (m2s-3), which is 2(10 )O − (m2s-3), the vertical distributions of 
dissipation rates decay exponentially to trough level which is of 3(10 )O − (m2s-3).  
The time-averaged turbulence dissipation rates of present results are normalized by 
Froude-scaling and compared with previous measurements at a corresponding surf-zone position 
h/hb~0.56 as shown in Fig. 27, where η  is the mean water surface elevation, h is the local mean 
water depth and hb is the mean water depth at breaking point. It shows that the time-averaged 
turbulence dissipation rate increases from the bed reaching a maximum near the mean water 
level before decreasing thereafter, which is similar to those of Govender et al. (2004). It is also 
seen that the estimates of turbulence dissipation rates among different experiments are in a 
reasonable agreement even though small discrepancy is found due to different approximations. 
Ting and Kirby (1996) estimated the turbulence using Eq. 6 and Govender et al. (2004) using 
linear fit in the inertial range with isotropic assumption. In the crest region, the time-averaged

where ( ) /( )b c bz z z zξ = − − , g is the gravitational acceleration, h is the local mean water depth, 
43.355 10α −= × , 3.682β = and the R-square value is 0.87. This curve demonstrates a 
reasonably well behaved similarity of vertical distributions of turbulence dissipation estimates 
under wave crests at different cross-shore locations in the inner surf zone.  
Variations of wave energies across surf zone  
Let mE , kE  and pE  denote the averaged kinetic energy of mean flow, turbulent kinetic 
energy and wave potential energy, per unit width, respectively. The total wave mechanical energy 
of broken wave, E , is then estimated by summing these three parts:  
 ( )2 212m hE u w dzη ρ− ⎡ ⎤= +⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦∫    (24) 
 2 21.33
2k h
E u w dz
η ρ−
⎡ ⎤′ ′= +⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦∫  (25) 
 [ ]p hE gz dzη ρ−= ∫  (26) 
 m k pE E E E= + +  (27) 
where the overbar denotes time averaging over one wave period and η  is the surface elevation. 
The cross-shore variations of mE , kE  and pE  are examined herein. The entire measured surf 
zone is divided into twelve control volumes in cross-shore direction with equal size of 61.82mm 
(width)×89.7mm(height), where mean value of quantities in the control volume is calculated. 
The reason for using such a control volume is to reduce the errors caused by the time averaging 
process.  
The corresponding results were shown in Fig. 31. It is observed the cross-shore variations of 
the energies display different process across the surf zone. At the incipience of wave breaking, 
the value of E is 1 (Wm-2s), Em and Ep are about 0.5 (Wm-2s), and Ek is close to zero. At position 
of x=216mm in the bore-established region, Ep and Em decrease rapidly to 0.3 (Wm-2s) and Ek 
increases to 0.074(Wm-2s. This evidences a redistribution of wave energy through the wave 
breaking process. The wave is mainly composed by the energy of wave component (Ep and Em) 
at the incipience of wave breaking, and then it transfers its energies to the turbulence fluctuation 
in the bore region. In the inner surf zone, while E and Em continue to decrease, Ep turns to 
increase (reflecting the wave setup) and Ek turns to decrease, indicating that the wave transfers its 
energy form the kinetic energy to potential energy. This manifests that that the total energy loss 
in the inner surf zone is caused by the attenuation of kinetic energy. In addition, it is observed 
that about 70% of the total energy of initial incident wave is dissipated within a horizontal width 
of one wavelength in the surf zone.  
Energy dissipation rate 
Energy flux 
The mean energy flux, F, per unit width is defined as:  
 ( )2 212hF p u w gz udzη ρ ρ− ⎡ ⎤= + + +⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦∫  (28) 
where p is the pressure. The measured mean energy flux may be approximated to within 10% by 
40 
approximation. Govender et al. (2004) estimated the total energy dissipation rates at three 
locations in surf zone by using wave height analysis and bore model approximation. Present 
study used the measured energy flux for the evaluation of energy dissipation rates and extended 
the results over the entire surf zone. 
Contribution of turbulence dissipation to energy dissipation  
To investigate the contribution of turbulence dissipation rate to energy dissipation rate, we 
first evaluate the depth-integrated turbulence dissipation rate and then calculate the 
time-averaging values: 
 *
h
dz
ηε ε−= ∫  (33) 
The calculated results are shown in Fig. 34. It is clear the values estimated using different 
assumptions are under the same order of magnitude. The cross-shore distribution of *ε  also 
reveals the different intensity of wave breaking in the surf zone. The values increase rapidly in 
the bore-established region (x≈150~250mm) and become maximum in the outer part of inner 
surf zone (x≈300~450mm), where the wave has been developed into a turbulent bore. Then, the 
values decrease as the bore propagates onshore further in the inner surf zone.  
Fig. 35shows the ratio of *ε  to DB. In the incipience of wave breaking, the ratio is very 
small (~0.01). Noted that the total energy dissipation rates are the largest and the turbulence 
dissipation rates are the smallest in this region, which means the major part of total wave energy 
may lose or be transported elsewhere outside this region (e.g. reflect to offshore, transport 
onshore further etc.). Then, the values increase rapidly in the bore-established region. This rapid 
increasing tendency in the bore-established region evidences the intense turbulence production 
during the wave breaking process. In the inner surf zone, the ratio reaches maximum values to 
about 0.08~0.15. The above results indicate that the turbulence dissipation becomes more 
important after the breaking wave transits to a developed turbulent bore in the inner surf zone. 
However, it is seen that the turbulence dissipation rates are much smaller than the total wave 
energy dissipation rates over the surf zone. The excess of wave energy may be transported 
shoreward to swash zone by the onshore component of velocity in the crest region (Petti and 
Longo, 2001; Govender et al., 2004) or be transferred elsewhere (e.g. transfer to potential energy 
of air bubble, see Hwung et al., 1992, reflect to offshore etc.).  
Concluding remarks 
In this study, the velocity fields of laboratory spilling waves were measured by PIV on a 
slope of 1/20. The measurements extended to the whole water column and cover the entire surf 
zone using the mosaic of image frames. The mean and turbulent quantities were decomposed 
using the ensemble averaging method by repeating the same experiments for twenty five runs in 
each field of view. The measured velocities are then used to examine the turbulence dissipation 
rates and total energy dissipation rates.  
We have directly evaluated the turbulence dissipation rates using the measured fluctuating 
strain rates with various assumptions to estimate the missed lateral component. Whether the 
missed components were assumed to be the same magnitude as streamwise component or to be 
neglected, all the methods appear to of the same order of magnitude. It is the first time that 
global distributions of turbulence dissipation rates over a laboratory surf-zone have been 
estimated. Results show that significant turbulence dissipation rates occur initially in the roller of

3. Transport mechanism of surf-zone turbulences: Insights from 
laboratory experiments 
 
Abstract 
Investigations of turbulence transport mechanism for progressive spilling breakers were 
performed through particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements in a laboratory surf zone. 
Transport terms due to convection, turbulent fluctuation transport, viscous diffusion, production 
and dissipation, were estimated over the entire water column in the bore-established region. 
These terms were compared and discussed for both turbulences generated in the crest region and 
below wave trough. It is evident that the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy is mainly 
contributed by the convection, turbulent transport and production for eddies in the crest region as 
well as into trough level. The dynamics of turbulence transport mechanism in the surf zone are 
dominated by the large-scale motions of turbulent eddies generated in the crest region. In 
addition, the local equilibrium assumption of turbulent production and dissipation could not be 
satisfied in the surf-zone area where turbulences were generated or stretched in. These novel 
quantitative evidences provide the insights for the mechanism of surf-zone process, which could 
also be useful as a reference for other researches. 
 
Introduction 
Wave breaking occurs in nearshore surf zone as deep water waves propagate into shallow 
waters. Irrotational wave motion becomes rotational free turbulent shear flow in this process. The 
turbulences generated by breaking wave are responsible for transfer of momentum to sediment, 
resulting in sediment transport. Surf-zone turbulences also play an important role in transfer of 
wave energy, momentum, heat and mass at air-sea interface. Several reviews devoted to the 
surf-zone dynamics and turbulences can be found in Peregrine [1983], Battjes [1988], 
Christensen et al. [2002], Longo et al. [2002]. 
 Descriptive representations of breaking process using photography [Basco, 1985; Jansen, 
1986] or flow visualization (FV) techniques [Nadaoka et al., 1989; Lin and Hwung, 1992] were 
carried out for decades. Advancing insights for the knowledge of surf-zone turbulence intensity 
were achieved through quantitative flow measurements, which were carried out using point 
measuring technique such as hot-film anemometer [e.g. George et al., 1994],  acoustic Doppler 
velocimeter [e.g. Elgar et al., 2005], and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) [e.g. Stive, 1980; 
Nadaoka et al., 1989; Ting and Kirby, 1996; Cox and Kobayashi, 2000; Stansby and Feng, 2005; 
De Serio and Mossa, 2006; Shin and Cox, 2006]. Recently, the measurements of turbulence level 
in the surf zone were extended to crest region using PIV technique [Govender et al., 2002; 
Govender et al., 2004; Kimmoun and Branger, 2007].  
The flow fields and turbulent intensity level in the surf zone were revealed by researches 
such as Ting and Kirby [1995; 1996], Govender et al.[2002], De Serio and Mossa [2006], 
Kimmoun and Branger [2007] etc. Further insight for turbulence transport is essential for 
modeling the surf-zone dynamics. However, rare investigations have provided such important 
quantitative results. Ting and Kirby [1995; 1996] examined the turbulence transport for plunging 
and spilling breakers below trough level with LDV. By using point measuring technique, the 
temporal velocities are under an assumption that breaking waves are slowly varying from the

where the coefficient 4/3 is obtained on a basis that breaking waves have characteristics similar 
to that of the plane wake (Svendsen, 1987) and the three-dimensional TKE density can be 
estimated well from the two-dimensional measurement by using this coefficient (Christensen, 
2006). Since the pressure field is not measured, the pressure transport term could not be 
evaluated directly in this study. We assume 0v =  and y-derivates can be neglected since the 
wave before breaking is two-dimensional without y-variations. Those terms were rewritten in the 
coordinates of Cartesian system:

Experiments 
The experiments were performed in a two-dimensional glass side-walled wave flume 
located at Tainan Hydraulics Laboratory. Regular waves were generated by a piston type 
58 
than 0.05 as 20N ≥ . The convergence tests confirm that meaningful turbulence quantities can be 
obtained in the experiments, which agrees with Chang and Liu’s (1999) suggestion by using the 
ensemble average method over 16 or more repeated measurements.

Results and discussions 
Length scale of turbulence  
The Kolmogorov length scale is defined as  
 3 1/ 4( / )kη ν ε=  (13) 
In order to estimate the different terms of TKE budget equation, the spatial resolution of 
velocity field must be no larger than the order of ten times the Kolmogorov length scale [Cowen 
and Monismith, 1997]. If the spatial resolution is insufficiently high, only few transport terms or 
only integral properties could be estimated [see results given by Chang and Liu, 1999; Melville 
et al., 2002; Kimmoun and Branger, 2007]. Figure 2 is the calculated length scale for the wave 
breaking phase with a spatial resolution of dx = 1.212mm. We present this phase due to that 
smallest values of kη  were obtained. Clearly, values of kη  are higher than 0.24 mm below 
trough level and decrease to ~0.12 mm in the crest region above the mean water level. The 
average value of kη  in the crest region is about 0.115 mm, which is 10.5 times smaller than the 
spatial resolution of velocity fields. Accordingly, the spatial resolution of velocity field is good 
enough to estimate the terms of TKE budget equation.  
 
Turbulence transport in the crest region 
Figure 3 presents the measured different terms of TKE budget equation for breaking phase. 
Strongest turbulent kinetic energy locates near the toe of the roller in the front face of wave crest 
above mean water elevation. Multiple structures of high values of turbulent kinetic energy 
density are observed in the crest region. Stansby and Feng (2005) found multiple eddies being 
elongated in the crest region during breaking wave propagation. At the toe of the roller, high 
negative values of convection term are observed [Kimmoun and Branger, 2007]. Similarly, 
strongest values of turbulent transport are also observed near the toe of the roller. The 
magnitudes of the measured turbulent transport term approximate that of the convection and they

layer flow using high-resolution particle image velocimetry 
Abstract 
An experimental study for the smooth boundary layer flow under spilling breakers in a 
laboratory surf zone is presented. Oscillating fluid velocities within a viscous boundary layer 
with a thickness of O (1) mm were efficiently measured simultaneously over ten points using a 
high spatial resolution particle image velocimetry (PIV). A macro photography technique was 
applied in the ordinary PIV system and the optical magnification of the CCD camera was 
improved to achieve a resolution of 6.7953 µm / pixel. Analyzed results of traditional 
cross-correlation PIV calculation showed that the velocities inside the viscous wall region can be 
measured robustly by the presented techniques. This measurement provides novel experimental 
results for the vertical distributions of the velocity profile, the turbulent kinetic energy density, 
and the spatial distribution of the turbulent structure in the surf-zone boundary layer.

Introduction 
Understanding boundary layer flow in the surf zone is important to geophysical, oceanic, 
coastal, and environmental researchers because of its significance for energy dissipation and 
sediment transport. Surf-zone turbulence is generated primarily in the crest region through wave 
breaking and secondarily by shear stress in the wave bottom boundary layer (WBBL). The 
turbulence produced in the crest region stretches into the interior region below the wave trough 
during the breaking process (Lin and Hwung 1992; Ting and Kirby 1996; Christensen et al. 
2002). Turbulence may further penetrate into the WBBL and change the internal characteristics 
of flow motion. However, few studies have addressed boundary-layer turbulence as well as the 
effect of the interaction between the turbulence generated by these two sources in the crest region 
and WBBL (Christensen et al. 2002). 
Because the WBBL is so thin (on the order of 1 mm), measurement of the flow in a 
laboratory boundary layer in an ordinary small wave flume is arduous work. For this reason, 
some experimental studies have used oscillating fluid tunnels in which higher near-bed orbital 
stream velocity can be obtained. For example, Jonsson and Carlsen (1976) measured the 
near-bottom velocity on a smooth bed in an oscillating water tunnel. Hino et al. (1983) used a 
laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) and hot-wire anemometers to measure the smooth boundary 
layer flow in an oscillating wind tunnel. However, an oscillating water tunnel poses a 
methodological problem: It can not produce wave breaking. To overcome this problem, the 
turbulence generated by wave breaking can be simulated using a series of grids placed a certain 
distance above the bottom (e.g., Fredsøe et al. 2003). However, it is better to investigate the 
surf-zone WBBL with turbulence generated naturally by wave breaking instead of by artificial 
grids. 
Measurements of boundary layer flow in a laboratory wave flume are difficult to perform 
and rarely have been made. Deigaard et al. (1991) used a hot film probe to measure the temporal 
variation of bottom shear stress under breaking waves on a smooth sloping bottom. Cox et al. 
(1996) employed the LDV technique to measure the velocities under spilling breakers on a rough, 
66 
PIV measurements. A sufficient concentration of tracer particles was placed near the bottom 
region before each test run.  
The wave profiles were measured by three capacitance-type wave gages with a sampling 
rate of 50 Hz. The data was recorded by a data acquisition board controlled by Labview 
(National Instruments). The first wave gauge was set in the constant depth water 6 m away from 
the wave paddle to examine the incident wave condition. The second gauge was at x = –39 cm in 
the pre-breaking zone and the third was set at x = 0 cm (p1) and x = 25 cm (p2). The local still 
water depth, d, was 5.3 cm at p1 and 4.05 cm at p2. Monochromatic waves with an incident 
wave period of 1.0 second and an incident wave height of 3.0 cm were generated in the constant 
depth water of 0.36 m. The corresponding offshore surf similarity parameter (Battjes 1974) is 
0.036, and the breaking wave was obviously a spilling type. The local average wave height was 
3.69 cm at p1 and 2.75 cm at p2. Position 1 was at the bore established region in the outer surf 
zone and p2 was at the inner surf zone according to the description given by Lin and Hwung 
(1992).  
The velocity field was calculated based on the zero-padded fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) 
cross-correlation and the three points Gaussian peak in the TSI’s Insight (also used by 
Hambleton et al. 2006). Each pair of images was processed from an interrogation window size of 
32× 32 pixels using 50% overlap. Only 1600 × 1184 pixels of the images were used to calculate. 
The final data set contains a 99 × 73 grid of velocity vectors on a 16-pixel square grid with a 
spatial resolution of 0.1087× 0.1087 mm2. A global range filter and a standard deviation filter 
were used to remove spurious vectors. Then, the missing velocities were interpolated using the 
Kriging method (Agterberg 1970; also used by Chang and Liu 1999). 
Because each breaking wave within the wave train is slightly different in the surf zone, it is 
better to decompose the mean and fluctuating velocities using the ensemble-average method by 
repeating the same experiments instead of the moving-average or phase-average methods. To 
measure the flow velocity under the same wave phase among different test runs, the second wave 
gauge was used as a reference external trigger signal. A threshold of trigger was set to begin the 
measuring procedure of the surface elevation. Then, the exposure time of the images and the 
illumination time of the laser were carefully controlled by TTL signals generated from a time 
counter connected synchronously to the data acquisition board. After considering the 
experimental conditions, the time interval between two successive laser pulses was set at 0.25 ms. 
The camera frame and laser illumination rates were set at 20 Hz, yielding a PIV velocity field 
rate of 10 Hz and hence a temporal resolution of 10 phases per second. The same experiments 
were repeated 30 times, and the velocity fields were measured for 12 s in each test run. To 
increase the measured phases, another series of test runs was conducted by setting a time delay 
of 0.05 s of PIV relative to the first series of experiments. Figure2 shows the combined results of 
the ensemble-averaged horizontal velocity at p2 at a vertical position of zm = 1.4678 mm (zm = z 
+ d is defined as positive upward with zm = 0 on the fixed bottom and d = the still water depth) 
for the two series (without and with time delay). Clearly, this time-delay method produced twice 
the resolution (20 wave phases per second) in the ensemble-averaged results. 
The ensemble-averaged mean streamwise (horizontal) velocity, U, and vertical velocity, W, 
are defined as:

onshore and offshore components also occurred at p2. In Addition, the crest velocities at the 
boundary layer at p2 were smaller than those under the trough phase.  
To make a clear comparison of the asymmetric distributions between onshore and offshore 
component at p1 and p2, the vertical profiles of the time-averaged streamwise velocitiesU are 
shown in Fig. 6. The U  at p1 increased from 0 at the bottom to positive values for 0 < zm /δ < 
2.11 and then changed to negative values as the non-dimensional height increased further. Lin 
and Hwung (2002) reported that the positive value of U , reflecting the onshore mass transport 
in the WBBL, occurs for 0 < zm /δ < 6~7 in the pre-breaking zone. In the current study, the 
mass transport also occurred at p1 but the value became smaller. However, U  was negative for 
the whole water column at p2 and no onshore mass transport occurred in the WBBL. The 
negative values of U  outside the boundary layer reveals the occurrence of the undertow in the 
trough level region (Ting and Kirby, 1994). These findings further suggest the occurrence of 
onshore mass transport in the WBBL from the shoaling region to the outer surf zone and offshore 
movement from the inner surf zone to the outer surf zone, which implies the amassment of 
sediment in the borderline. 
 
Maximum onshore/offshore velocity components 
The maximum onshore and offshore velocity profiles are significant for wave energy 
dissipation by bottom friction and for sediment transport. In this study, the temporal distributions 
of the velocity profiles showed that the maximum onshore and offshore velocity components, 
U + and U − , occurred at t/T = 0.5 at p1 and t/T = 0.8 at p2. Figure 7 presents the dimensionless 
vertical distribution of U + and U − at the two positions as well as the profile reported by Lin and 
Hwung (2002). The profiles were normalized by the maximum onshore and offshore free stream 
velocities, *U
+  and *U
− , respectively, obtained by averaging the corresponding data for zm /δ > 
6. The maximum overshoots of U +  were 1.067, 1.37, and 1.66 times the *U
+  at the 
pre-breaking zone, p1, and p2, respectively. The corresponding vertical position of the 
occurrence of the maximum overshoot (defined as the boundary layer thickness) were at zm /δ 
= 2.35, 1.54, and 1.16. The increase of */U U
+ +  and decrease of the boundary layer thickness in 
the surf zone is attributed to the existence of turbulence and decay of the free stream velocity 
caused by wave breaking. Additionally, the normalized vertical profiles of U −  at the two 
positions were similar to each other and no overshoots were observed near the bottom region. 
Turbulent kinetic energy density 
Figure 8 presents the temporal variations of the vertical profile of the TKE density. The 
order of magnitude of the TKE at p1 was relatively small because of the smooth bottom 
condition (~10-5 m2s–2). The TKE at p2 was larger than the TKE at p1, and the maximum TKE 
occurred under the wave trough phases (t/T = 1.3 at p1 and t/T = 1.6 at p2). The bottom was so 
smooth that the external turbulence was considered the dominant source for distributing the TKE. 
This finding reflects previous observations that the spilling process is a local phenomenon in the 
outer surf zone and that the penetration of turbulence is lesser in the outer surf zone (p1) than in 
the inner surf zone (p2) (Lin and Liu 1998; Lin and Hwung 1992). These results further suggest 
70 
was found to occur in the outer surf-zone boundary layer, but it changed to offshore transport in 
the inner surf zone. The value of the maximum overshoot of onshore streamwise velocity, the 
boundary layer thickness, and the turbulence kinetic energy are not constant across the surf zone. 
This suggests the different extent of turbulence penetration in the outer and inner surf zone. From 
this study, it is straightforward to suggest a further observation of the boundary layer under 
plunging breaker due to a different level of turbulence penetration in the whole water column.
