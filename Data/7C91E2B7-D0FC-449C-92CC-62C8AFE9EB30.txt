run-up distance and the pressure trace at fully 
vaporized conditions, in which the initial 
temperatures were at 413oK, 433oK, and 453oK, were 
similar to those of gaseous mixtures, such as 
propane-oxygen mixture.

conditions the tone levels can be of such 
magnitude that the integrity of nearby structural 
components or sensitive instrumentation is 
jeopardized. Suppression of such undesired 
oscillations is under interests of scientists for 
many years [1-4]. 
2. Experimental setup 
The detonation system comprises an atomizer, a 
detonation tube and heating apparatus. The 
atomizer is a slit nozzle pressure injector, 
manufactured by the Denso Corporation (Model 
23209-39057-B0), which is used in direct 
injection gasoline engine. Since the injector is 
located on the engine itself, it is designed to 
function in environments of high temperature and 
pressure. The injector atomizes fuel with a V-
shaped fan. The spray dispersion angle is 60 deg 
from front view and the injection angle is inclined 
20 deg from the axis of the nozzle tip from side 
view. A power transistor-based control system 
that accepts transistor-transistor logic signals was 
built to operate the injector [16]. This feature 
provides a flexibility in controlling the dynamic 
flow rate, i.e., the amount of fuel injected per 
pulse. Furthermore, injection duration (10 ms) and 
fuel pressure (5 MPa) were controlled to meet the 
required droplet size (< 10 m). The injector was 
installed directly on the closed end of detonation 
tube. The oxidizer was simultaneously mixed with 
fuel droplet during the fuel atomization process, 
which can reduce the complexity of inlet 
component.  
The smooth detonation tube was made of 
aluminum 6061-T6 with a length of 1,143 mm 
and inner tube diameter of 101.6 mm with a 9 mm 
wall thickness, as seen in the schematic drawing 
shown in Fig. 1. The ignition system is a 
transformer (Model No. May ＆  Christe 
z201402e2, 220 VAC-14,000 VDC) at the closed 
end, and the diaphragm (LUMIRROR polyester 
film) was employed to separate the detonation 
tube and the open end. Furthermore, uniform 
temperature distribution along the axial direction 
of detonation tube is required. The electric tape 
heaters were strapped uniformly along the entire 
length of the detonation tube. Four thermocouples 
were installed on the tube’s inner surface or 
inserted at the inner tube’s center at 76.2, 152.4, 
190.5 and 533.4 mm from the closed end. At the 
designed temperature of 373K, the temperature 
distributions and deviation are shown in Fig. 2a. 
Note that there is no heat isolation cushion to 
cover the flanges at the closed and open ends. 
Thus, more energy was required to reach the 
designed temperature. Therefore, a temperature 
peak was observed in the initial stage of heating 
process (before 1500 sec), in which the maximum 
temperature deviation from the designed 
temperature is about 70K. Within one-hour 
heating duration, the temperature deviation is 
decreased to about 20K. Furthermore, it can be 
seen that the temperature near the flanges was 
lower than that at the center of detonation tube, 
indicating significant heat loss of the flanges at 
the closed and open ends. Thus, the electrically 
heated rods were inserted into the flanges, as 
shown in Fig. 1, to reduce the axial temperature 
variation of the detonation tube. As shown in Fig. 
2b, the maximum temperature deviation from the 
designed temperature could be controlled within 
20oK, and the temperature deviation along the 
axial direction of detonation tube was within 2 K 
in the 3000-second heating duration that could 
insure the experimental stability and repeatability. 
The mixture of JP-8 and oxygen was used in 
the present study. The designed equivalence ratio 
and initial pressure were 1.2 and 0.1 MPa (1 atm), 
respectively. The proportion of oxygen was 
achieved using the method of partial pressure [17]. 
Prior to each run, the detonation tube was 
evacuated to 20-30 Pa. The oxygen was 
subsequently heated to the desired temperature 
within ± 2K using two thermocouples and PID 
controllers over a period of 1 to 1.5 hours. Then 
JP-8 was injected into the detonation tube. 
Furthermore, the pressure transducer (OMEGA-
PX1009) with high temperature resistance was 
installed in the detonation tube to check the actual 
vapor pressure, and the vapor proportion was 
estimated with the equation of state. For the 
propagation of pressure wave, the pressure taps 
were separated at 3.81-cm intervals along the 
detonation tube and the PCB dynamic pressure 
transducers (Type 112A05) were employed. The 
locations of pressure transducers, which were 
adjusted for different initial temperature 
conditions, are shown in the Table 1. One 
photodiode was also installed at the closed end to 
detect the onset of detonation (light of flame), tddt. 
The signals of the sensors were acquired and 
stored by the NI-PXI high-speed data acquisition 
modules, and the typical sampling rate is 500 
ksamples/s. However, it is subjective to 
implement the propagating time because the front 
of a detonation or combustion wave is not 
measured as a step rise but is spread over a small 
time interval. A nonstationary cross-correlation 
function (NCCF) is used to estimate the 
propagating time of pressure wave [18]. Note that 
there were three experiments conducted for each 
characterize the sensitivity of the mixture to being 
detonated [23]. A study of Kaneshige and 
Shepherd [1] indicated that the cell width of a 
stoichiometric mixture of propane-oxygen at 0.05 
MPa and 293K is about 2.5 mm.  In this study, the 
cellular structure was recorded near the open end 
of the tube where detonation propagates with a 
quasi-steady velocity. With the equivalence of 1.2 
at 0.1 MPa and 433K, the cell width is estimated 
to be about 1 mm, indicating that some detonation 
properties of the fully vaporized JP-8 with oxygen 
are similar to those of the propane/oxygen mixture. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The non-uniform temperature distributions 
were observed near the flanges at the closed and 
open ends of the smooth detonation tube. The 
electrically heated rods in the flanges were 
required to reduce the axial temperature variation 
along the detonation tube. The vapor proportion 
for the mixture of JP-8 with oxygen is an 
important factor determining whether the 
detonation wave would be initiated or not. The 
single-shot experiments at the atmospheric 
condition were conducted to investigate the 
effects of initial temperature on detonation 
initiation. The results are summarized as below: 
1. JP-8 was not completely vaporized (about 
80% vapor) at the initial temperature of 
373K. The detonation wave was not 
observed.  
2. Although a portion of JP-8 was in a liquid 
state at the initial temperature of 393K, there 
was enough fuel vapor (about 95% vapor) to 
initiate a reaction that results in rapid heating, 
vaporization, and reaction rates behind the 
shock wave for detonation initiation with a 
longer DDT run-up distance.  
3. Detonation initiation was observed at a 
shorter DDT run-up distance for the mixture 
of fully vaporized JP-8 and oxygen when the 
initial temperature exceeded 413K. The 
propagation of detonation wave shows a 
similar characteristic as that of 
propane/oxygen mixture.

針對 PDE 的研究，其中關鍵的技術之一為如何形成爆震波，一般而言，爆震波可經由直接
點火(Direct-ignition)或利用爆燃波轉變到爆震波(DDT)的方式產生，但就點火能量的需
求而言，先前研究指出利用直接點火的方式來點燃低蒸氣壓燃料的爆震波，在理論混合比
下需要約 105 焦耳的點火能量。此點火能量約為一般火星塞(~100 mJ)的 106 倍大，由此
可得知利用直接點火的方式來產生爆震波是非常困難且不實用，故目前大部分的研究皆採
用爆燃波轉換成爆震波的模式。至於燃料部分，先前之研究主要是亦以氣態燃料(如乙烯、
乙炔、丙烷及氫氣等)為主，但是高壓縮的鋼瓶將增加系統的重量及危險性，因此在單位
體積下可釋放能量的考量下，應用液態燃料於 PDE 有其絕對的必要性。其次，針對爆燃波
轉換成爆震波的探討，使用氣態燃料時，燃料較易與氧化劑產生化學反應而形成爆震波，
且無蒸發相關的問題存在。但是由 ZND 模型可知，induction zone 介於震波與反應區之
間，其代表化學反應及液滴蒸發所需時間之相對距離，當化學反應釋放能量太慢時將導致
前端震波與反應區的分離而無法形成爆震波，同時使用液態燃料必須經過霧化過程，霧化
粒徑亦將影響蒸發所需之時間，所以必須在化學反應前有足夠的液態燃料蒸發以獲得較快
的化學反應。由前人的研究顯示，與氧氣混合之霧化粒徑須低於 10 μm 方能產生爆震波，
而若是以空氣作為氧化劑，則油滴粒徑必須小於 3μm及至少 70%的燃油蒸氣比例，對於現
行的霧化器頗難達到此門檻。其次液態燃油之選用必須考慮安全及易取得，相對於汽油及
一些高揮發性的燃料，以煤油為基礎的 Jet A-1、JP-5、JP-8 及 JP-10 比較廣泛應用在軍
事及航空方面，在此考量下，本研究採用 JP-8 為燃料。進一步導入間歇沸騰的概念(預熱
