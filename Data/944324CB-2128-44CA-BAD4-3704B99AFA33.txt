DNA hybridization enhanced by the combined 
electrokinetic forces will be investigated in a DNA 
chip (i.e., an array of electrodes fabricated on a 
substrate encapsulated with a microfluidic chamber). 
Capture strands are immobilized on the electrode 
surface and the target strands suspended in solution 
are injected into the DNA chip. The combination of AC 
electroosmosis and electrophoresis can induce 
circulating fluid motion and attractive force on 
electrodes to manipulate target strands. Therefore, 
efficient mixing and high concentration of DNA pairs 
could accelerate the hybridization reaction. The 
active hybridization conditions including applied 
electric field, hybridization time, salt 
concentration of the solution, etc., will be 
investigated and optimized. Electrical detection of 
active hybridization will be investigated for the 
device miniaturization. Therefore, electrodes in the 
DNA chip work for mixing, concentration, 
hybridization, and also detection. After active 
hybridization is completed on the electrodes, gold 
nanoparticles are injected to indicate the hybridized 
DNA. Then, gold enhancement is performed to form a 
conductive layer across the electrodes for signal 
amplification. Resistance value will be measured to 
determine the presence of hybridization and also the 
concentration of target strands quantitatively on the 
specific electrode. The proposed techniques can be 
potentially developed the portable diagnostic device 
and used in various field applications.

bio-molecules from a large region in the bulk fluid to the electrode surface. The concentration 
of yeast cells and colloidal particles on electrode surface has been reported [19, 20]. Also, 
DNA concentrator using AC electroosmosis has been developed to concentrate large 
molecular weight molecules such as λ-phage DNA (48.5kbp) and 200nm florescent dye [21, 
22].  
 
Objectives 
 In this report, AC electroosmosis and electrophoresis were applied simultaneously to 
concentrate DNA molecules on the electrode surface. The applied electric field required only 
a low electric potential of a few volts. Because AC electroosmosis alone is not sufficient to 
hold small molecular weight DNA such as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) which is as small 
as 20 nucleotides, electrophoresis can be applied simultaneously to provide an attractive force 
to hold the ssDNA molecules on the electrode surface. The DNA concentrator was a pair of 
circular electrodes on glass substrate. AC electroosmosis can generate bulk fluid flow to 
transport DNA molecules from a large effective region to the electrode surface. 
Electrophoresis can provide an attractive force to hold the DNA molecules on the electrode 
surface. We demonstrated the use of AC electroosmosis, electrophoresis, and the combined 
electrokinetic forces to concentrate two sizes of DNA molecules, i.e., double-stranded DNA 
(dsDNA) in 48.5kbp and ssDNA in 20 nucleotides. The DNA molecules were labeled by 
fluorescent dye and their motion was observed under a fluorescence microscope. 
Experimental results showed that the λ-phage DNA molecules could be concentrated by AC 
electroosmosis alone and that the ssDNA molecules were required in the combined 
electrokinetic forces. The magnitude of AC electroosmotic flow and electrophoretic force 
controlled by the applied electric potential and frequency was also demonstrated through 
these concentration experiments. 
 
Materials and Instrumentations 
The DNA concentrator was a pair of planar gold electrodes on glass substrate. 
Electrokinetic forces were generated by applying electric potential on the electrodes. For 
generating AC electroosmosis, a 50% duty cycle square wave was applied as AC electric field. 
For generating electrophoresis, DC voltage was utilized. Since the electrodes were bathed in 
electrolyte when applying electric field, electrolysis may happen and affect the function of 
the micro systems. Therefore, the AC electric field should not exceed 5Vp-p and the DC 
4 
surface and away from it vertically. At a particular moment when the molecules were 
manipulated to the center of the inner electrode surface, they experienced the null point of the 
AC electroosmotic flow. In the experiment, the dsDNA molecules coiled up and became 
sizable molecules. The effect of gravitational force on the ssDNA molecules was negligible 
compared to the dsDNA molecules. Moreover, the dsDNA molecules have lower mobility 
because of their size. Therefore, when the molecules were at the null point of the AC 
electroosmotic flow, the dsDNA molecules tended to stay at and concentrated on the 
electrode surface. However, the ssDNA molecules followed the AC electroosmotic flow and 
could not be concentrated. 
 
 
Concentration by electrophoresis 
 Since AC electroosmosis alone could not concentrate the ssDNA molecules on the 
electrode surface, electrophoresis induced by a DC electric field was utilized. As the ssDNA 
molecules carried negative charges, electrophoresis could generate an attractive force to 
transport the ssDNA molecules. The inner electrode was applied in positive electrical 
potential and the outer electrode was applied in negative electrical potential. 6-FAM 
fluorescent dye-labeled ssDNA molecules (20 nucleotides) suspended in Tris-EDTA buffer 
were utilized in the experiments. In the low DC electric field (below 1V), the ssDNA 
molecules were attracted and concentrated on the inner electrode surface instantly as shown 
in Figures 2(a)-(b). The fluorescent signal intensity, i.e., the concentration of the ssDNA 
molecules, increased within the region of the inner electrode. However, in the high DC 
electric field (1V or above), the ssDNA molecules were observed to be concentrated around 
the edges of the inner electrode as shown in Figures 2(c)-(e). We suggest that when the

fluorescent signal intensity represented the amount of the ssDNA molecules and was 
quantified by 8-bit gray level value converted by commercially available software. Higher 
gray level value represented higher fluorescent signal intensity. The concentration effect 
under different parameters of the applied electric field was plotted in Figure 4. The peak to 
peak amplitude of AC electric field, frequency of AC electric field, and amplitude of DC bias 
were compared and discussed below. 
 Applying higher peak to peak amplitude of AC electric field to the DNA concentrator 
could induce higher AC electroosmotic flow. Hence, more molecules could be manipulated to 
the electrode surface. In Figure 4, applying the same DC bias, e.g., 0.2V, the fluorescent 
signal intensity of applying 3Vp-p 200Hz AC electric field was larger than 2Vp-p 200Hz AC 
electric field. The same was observed between applying 3Vp-p 2000Hz and 2Vp-p 2000Hz 
AC electric field. But the effect was not significant because the magnitude of the AC 
electroosmotic flow was low when the AC electric field was in high frequency, e.g., 2000Hz. 
Therefore, the effect of the peak to peak amplitude of the AC electric field in high frequency 
was not dominant. The magnitude of AC electroosmotic flow generated by applying 200Hz 
AC electric field was higher than 2000Hz AC electric field (Figure 4). Applying DC bias on 
the DNA concentrator could induce electrophoretic force to attract charged molecules. 
Obviously, higher DC bias attracted more charged molecules (Figure 4). However, for the AC 
electric field of 3Vp-p 200Hz, the fluorescent signal intensity increased when the DC bias 
was between 0 and 0.5V but decreased when the DC bias was above 0.5V.

In this project, DNA molecules have been demonstrated to be concentrated on a 
specific location by AC electroosmotic and electrophoretic forces. A DNA 
concentrator, which is a pair of circular electrodes on glass substrate, was 
designed and fabricated for the DNA concentration. The applied electric field 
required only a low electric potential of a few volts. AC electroosmosis can 
generate bulk fluid flow to transport DNA molecules from a large effective region 
to the electrode surface. Electrophoresis can provide an attractive force to hold 
the DNA molecules on the electrode surface. We demonstrated the use of AC 
electroosmosis, electrophoresis, and the combined electrokinetic forces to 
concentrate two sizes of DNA molecules, i.e., double-stranded DNA in 48.5kbp and 
single-stranded DNA in 20 nucleotides. The magnitude of AC electroosmotic flow 
and electrophoretic force controlled by the applied electric potential and 
frequency was investigated to figure out the concentration conditions. By using 
this concentration method, double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA molecules 
can be concentrated on the electrode surface for enhancing the sample concentration 
locally. An effective collection and concentration of target samples can highly 
improve the signal to noise ratio in the subsequent detection process especially 
for diluted samples. This technique provides a solid foundation to investigate
