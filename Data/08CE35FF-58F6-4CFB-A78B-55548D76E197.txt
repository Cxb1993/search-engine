In this preliminary study, we have performed first principles density functional 
calculations to identify the stable configurations of hydrogen atoms as well as their interactions 
with boron atoms in a-SiO2.  For the sake of comparison, we also calculated the structure, 
stability, and diffusion of boron with hydrogen in crystalline silica. Our calculations showed that 
boron can form a variety of stable and meta-stable B-H complexes in SiO2 and the B-H pair can 
undergo diffusion along the SiO2 bond network by breaking and forming bond configurations 
with Si and O atoms. Based on the diffusion model proposed in this work, the activation energy 
for boron diffusion in the presence of hydrogen in a-SiO2 is predicted to be 3.72±0.5eV, in good 
agreement with the recent experimental measurements.  
 
II. CALCULATION METHODS 
Crystalline SiO2 is modeled using a 72-atom cell of α-quartz with lattice constants of a = 
4.916 Å  and c = 5.405 Å . A defect free a-SiO2 at a density of 2.2 g/cm
3
 is generated using a 
continuous random network model. Starting with randomly distributed 25 Si and 50 O atoms in a 
cubic supercell, the system is relaxed within the Keating-like model through a series of bond 
transpositions using the Metropolis Monte Carlo method. The amorphous structure is further 
relaxed using density functional theory calculations as described below. The average Si-O-Si 
bond angle and bond angle deviation of the equilibrated a-SiO2 structure are around 136
o
 and 15
o
, 
respectively, in good agreement with experimental measurements.     
All atomic structures and energies reported herein were calculated within the generalized 
gradient approximation [PW91 (Ref. 7)] to density functional theory (DFT) using the well 
established Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)
8
. All atoms were fully relaxed using the 
conjugated gradient method until the residual forces become smaller than 5×10
-2
eV/Å . Vanderbilt 
ultrasoft pseudopotential for core-electron interactions and a plane-wave basis set for valence 
electron states were employed. A plane-wave cut-off energy of 300 eV was used for ab initio MD 
simulations
9
 and 400 eV was used for structural optimization and energetic calculations. The 
Brillouin zone integration was performed using a (2×2×2) mesh of k points in the scheme of 
Monkhorst-Pack
10
. Diffusion barriers and pathways were calculated using the nudged elastic 
band method (NEBM)
11,12
. In applying this method, sixteen intermediate images were used to 
determine the converged minimum energy paths between adjacent local energy minimums.    
 
a Si-H pair was predicted to be 3.74 eV at the Si mid-gap, relative to the dissociation products of 
a B atom in the TrI configuration and a proton bonded to a lattice O atom. Therefore the bond 
strength of a B-H pair is stronger than that of a Si-H pair by 0.46eV in α-quartz. Since the Si-H 
bond strength in silane is 3.90-4.13eV in literatures, the B-H bond strength is estimated to be 
around 4.40~4.60eV.  
Next we examined the mechanism for the diffusion of a B-H pair in α-quartz. Fig. 2 
presents a viable route that we have identified for B-H pair diffusion, starting from a B atom at 
the BC site passivated by a H atom (BC-H). Our calculations showed that a B-H pair can diffuse 
along the bond networks by breaking and forming bond configurations with SiO2. The migration 
energy barrier for a B-H pair hopping over an oxygen atom was predicted to be 3.10 eV ((a) → (b) 
in Fig. 2). When the B-H pair hops over a lattice Si atom, it was found to form a meta-stable 
configuration, TrI-Hms1, as shown in Fig. 2 (c), where B atom is fourfold coordinated with one 
H, one Si, and two O atoms. The relative formation energy of TrI-Hms1 configuration was 
predicted to be 1.30 eV higher than the BC-H configuration, and the corresponding forward and 
backward energy barriers were predicted to be 1.62 and 0.32 eV, respectively. On the other hand, 
although B atom becomes immobile staying in TrI-H configuration, it can turn into TrI-Hms1 
configuration via direct hopping of hydrogen followed by the transformation into a mobile B-H 
pair. The energy barrier for this conversion was predicted to be 2.12 eV. Therefore the overall 
barrier for the diffusion of B-H complexes in α-quartz was determined to be 3.10 eV, which is 
higher than that predicted for boron diffusion in α-quartz without hydrogen (2.5 eV). Furthermore, 
the dissociation energy of a B-H pair was estimated by adding the migration barrier of a proton to 
the binding energy. Since the calculated diffusion barriers for a proton hopping between two 
lattice O atoms is 1.20 eV, the dissociation energy of a B-H pair was predicted to be 
approximately 5.40 eV at the Si mid-gap, suggesting the existence of stable B-H complexes in 
SiO2.  
 
B. Boron in Amorphous SiO2 
When boron atoms stay in amorphous silica, however, two more stable B-H complexes 
can be formed in addition to the DvB-H and TvB1-H configurations. As shown in Fig 1(c), B 
atom staying at the BC site interacts with one lattice O atom to form a threefold coordinated 
illustrated in Fig. 3(c). The meta-stable B2O3-SiOH complex can dissociate into a B2O3 complex 
plus a hydrogen bonded divalent Si atom (see Fig. 3(d)) followed by the transformation into a 
stable TrIII-SH configuration. The corresponding forward and backward barriers for this 
transformation were predicted to be 0.1-0.4 eV and 1.2-1.7 eV, respectively. On the other hand, 
there is another possibility that the hydrogen bonded divalent Si atom may interact with the B2O3 
complex, rather than a neighboring lattice O atom, to form the TvB1-H configuration as shown in 
Fig. 4. The corresponding forward and backward barriers for this process were predicted to be 
0.1-0.4 eV and 1.0-1.5eV, respectively. Based on these inter-conversion paths proposed above, 
the energy barriers for the B atom staying in the immobile configurations such as TrI-H and 
TrIII-SH to transform into a mobile DvB-H configuration were estimated to be around 1.75±0.6 
eV.     
Based on these fundamental findings, we propose a novel mechanism for B diffusion in 
the presence of hydrogen in amorphous silica which consists of the following key events: (1) 
formation of stable B-H complexes such as DvB-H, TvB1-H, TvB2 + E’-H, and TvB3 +S-H 
configurations in a-SiO2; (2) migration of a B-H pair over a O atom; (3) migration of a B-H pair 
over a Si atom; (4) interconversion between DvB-H and TvB1-H configurations; (5) 
interconversion between DvB-H and TvB3 + S-H configurations. In this model, we assume that 
boron can diffuse in the form of B-H pair by breaking and forming bond configurations along the 
SiO2 bond network as hydrogen is present in the system. The migration of B-H pair over an 
oxygen atom was predicted to be the rate limiting step with a diffusion barrier of 3.45±0.40 eV. 
When the B-H pair hops over a lattice Si atom, it may turn into other stable configurations such 
as TvB1-H and TvB3 + S-H at certain locations in a-SiO2. The relative formation energy of B 
atom in the DvB-H configuration was predicted to be around 0.34±0.6 eV higher than the TvB1-
H and TvB3 + S-H configurations. Therefore, considering the formation energy of a B-H pair 
from the TvB3 + S-H or TvB1-H configurations, the overall barrier for boron diffusion in the 
presence of hydrogen in a-SiO2 was predicted to be approximately 3.72±0.5 eV, in good 
agreement with the recent experimental measurements (3.60-3.82 eV). Moreover, this value also 
lies within the same range as that predicted for boron diffusion in the absence of hydrogen 
(3.6±0.6 eV) in amorphous silica though the mechanisms are different.  
formation of various B-H complexes, hopping of B-H pairs along the SiO2 bond network, and the 
interconverion between different B-H complexes. In this model, the pre-exponential factor is 
expected to increase with the hydrogen concentrations while the overall diffusion barrier remains 
unchanged. The overall diffusion barrier is predicted to be approximately 3.72±0.5 eV, in good 
agreement with the recent experimental measurements of 3.60-3.82 eV.
