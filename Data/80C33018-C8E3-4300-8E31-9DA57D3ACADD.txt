orientations on their mechanical properties. The 
circumferential elastic modulus of the tubular 
scaffold was closely related to the fiber 
directions； the larger the off-axis fiber angle the 
greater the circumferential elastic modulus. The 
distribution of fiber orientations, on the other 
hand, manifested itself in the mechanical behavior 
via the Poisson effect. Similar to cell sheet-based 
vascular tissue engineering, tubular tissue-
engineered constructs were prepared by wrapping cell-
seeded scaffold membranes, alleviating the difficulty 
associated with cell seeding in electrospun 
scaffolds. Histology of the construct illustrated 
that cells were aligned to the fiber directions in 
the construct, demonstrating the potential to control 
the microstructure of tissue-engineered vascular 
grafts using the electrospun scaffold membrane.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Atherosclerotic vascular diseases, including coronary arterial and peripheral arterial 
diseases, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the modern society. In some patients, 
arterial bypass surgery is required to restore blood flow and preserve functions of downstream 
tissues. Synthetic grafts (e.g., expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and Dacron), which work well in 
replacing high-flow, large-diameter arteries, are not suitable for small vessel reconstructions due 
to acute thrombogenicity and anastomotic intimal hyperplasia. Autologous native vessels such as 
the saphenous vein and internal thoracic artery remain the gold standard for small-diameter 
arterial replacement. Unfortunately, many patients do not have suitable autologous vessels for 
surgery because of previous harvest or other vascular disease. Moreover, additional surgery for 
vessel harvest is required for using autologous vessels. A variety of tissue-engineering strategies 
have thus been developed for functional small-diameter vascular grafts (see (Gong and Niklason, 
2006; Isenberg et al., 2006; Kakisis et al., 2005; Stegemann et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007) for a 
review). Indeed, containing vascular cells and capable of remodeling, tissue-engineered vascular 
grafts (TEVGs) have great potential to resolve this issue. 
The long-term patency of a TEVG in many respects is influenced by biomechanics 
(Nerem, 2000). As the TEVG is constantly subjected to shear stress and wall tensile stress from 
pulsatile blood flow upon implantation, it should have sufficient ultimate strength (i.e., burst 
pressure). Suture retention strength, on the other hand, is essential for surgeons to perform 
anastomosis. Besides the two basic requirements, appropriate mechanical behavior of the TEVG 
is most desired as compliance mismatch of the vascular graft to the host artery could lead to 
anastomotic intimal hyperplasia, resulting in graft failure (Ballyk et al., 1998; Greenwald and 
Berry, 2000).

for the scaffold membrane approach. Specifically, membranes that contain randomly oriented, 
moderately aligned, or highly aligned fibers were fabricated by collecting electrospun fibers at 
three different drum rotation speeds (250, 1000, and 1500 rpm), respectively. Membranes of each 
type were wrapped around a small-diameter mandrel to form the tubular scaffolds. Particularly, 
the tubular scaffolds with three different off-axis fiber angles (30, 45, and 60) were formed 
using membranes that contain aligned fibers. These scaffolds were subjected to biaxial 
mechanical testing to examine the effects of fiber directions as well as the distribution of fiber 
orientations on their mechanical properties. 
Despite of various methods in creating porous scaffolds, it is, in general, challenging and 
time consuming to have cells evenly distributed in the scaffold. A number of methods have been 
proposed to actively enhance cell infiltration. Vacuum combined with centrifugal force and flow, 
for example, were used to facilitate seeding cells into a tubular scaffold (Soletti et al., 2006). 
Methods developed for seeding a specific type of scaffold (e.g., phase separation, particulate 
leaching, etc), however, may not work well in electrospun scaffolds; the compact, dense 
electrospun fibers impose additional difficulty in the seeding process. In this study, a novel 
approach of cell seeding was introduced: instead of being seeded after the tubular scaffold is 
formed, cells were seeded onto the scaffold membrane prior to the wrapping process. The 
feasibility of this approach as well as the efficacy of using electrospun fibers in controlling the 
microstructure of the construct was examined. 
 
2. METHODS 
2.1. Materials.

collected on cover glasses affixed to the rotating drum. Five speeds (750, 1000, 1250, 1500, and 
2000 rpm) were tested. For each speed, eight to ten microphotographs of the fibers were acquired 
by an optical microscope (DM2500P, Leica, Germany) and analyzed by a MATLAB routine 
based on a fast Fourier transform algorithm for the distribution of fiber orientations (Hu et al., 
2009). An alignment index (AI), which is defined as the fraction of fibers lying within 20 of the 
predominant direction normalized by that of a random distribution (=0.22) (Ng and Swartz, 2006), 
was used to quantify the distribution of fiber orientations. Note that values of AI range from 4.55 
for strong alignment (i.e., parallel fibers) to 1.00 for random alignment. 
2.4. Construction of the tubular scaffold.  
Figure 1 shows the procedure for the preparation of a tubular scaffold. As electrospun 
scaffolds are highly porous, to avoid water leakage during mechanical testing a thin 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tube was formed on a small-diameter rotatable mandrel 
(O.D.=3mm) prior to the wrapping process according to a published method (Stevanov et al., 
2000). Note that a reduced amount of curing agent was used (Base/Curing agent=20/1) for a 
more compliant PDMS; when tested separately the PDMS tube experiences elastic instability at 
20-30 mmHg and thus has negligible mechanical contribution. Essentially, the tubular scaffold 
was constructed by wrapping scaffold membranes on the small-diameter rotatable mandrel. 
Herein, an automatic wrapping device based on Kubo’s design (Kubo et al., 2007) was used 
(Figure 2). In order to examine the effects of the distribution of fiber orientations on the 
mechanical properties of tubular scaffolds, three groups of membranes, in which fibers were 
collected at three different drum rotation speeds, were fabricated. Membranes collected at 250 
rpm (linear tangential velocity=1.3 m/s), 1000 rpm (5.3 m/s), and 1500 rpm (8 m/s) were denoted 
as RO (randomly oriented), MA (moderately aligned), and HA (highly aligned), respectively. To

was then subjected to a cyclic pressurization and data from the loading curve of the cycle was 
analyzed for the mechanical properties of the scaffold as follows. 
The unloaded thickness of the scaffold, H, was measured by a digital caliper to determine 
the wall volume of the scaffold. That is, 
 2 2V B A L  , 
where B is the unloaded outer radius, A(=BH) the unloaded inner radius, and L the unloaded 
length. Although not measurable, the deformed inner radius, a, at any deformed state can be 
computed given the on-line measurement of deformed outer radius, b, with the assumption of 
incompressibility. That is,

where z is the axial stretch ratio equal to l/L; l is the loaded length. 
Once a and b are known, the pressure-diameter data can be used to calculate the mean 
circumferential stress, , as

where P is the luminal pressure, and h(=ba) the deformed thickness. The associated mean

Finally, the axial tensile force reported herein is the force experienced by the tubular scaffold in 
 11 
cultured for 24 hours or two weeks, the tubular constructs were fixed and processed for 
histological examination. 
2.7. Scanning Electron Microscopy. 
For acellular or processed cell-seeded scaffold membranes, fiber samples were carefully cut 
from the membrane, mounted onto studs, and sputtercoated with palladium. Images were acquired 
using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6700, JEOL, Japan). 
Specifically, the images of acellular membranes were imported into ImageJ for fiber diameter 
analysis. 
2.8. Histology. 
To examine the efficacy of using electrospun fibers in controlling tissue microstructure, 
longitudinal and cross sections of tubular tissue-engineered constructs were prepared for 
histological examination. The tubular tissue-engineered constructs were fixed in 10% 
neutral-buffered formalin overnight. The constructs were then embedded in Jung tissue freezing 
medium (Leica, Germany) with proper orientations, and frozen rapidly on dry ice. Ten-micron 
sections were cut on positively charged slides using a cryostat (Cryotome E, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA). After removal of freezing medium on the slides, the sections were 
stained with H&E. Finally, the slides were dehydrated and coverslipped with Entellan (Merck, 
Germany). Images were acquired by an optical microscope (DM2500P, Leica, Germany). 
2.9. Statistical Analysis. 
To compare the stiffness of the tubular scaffolds that have different microstructures, elastic 
modulus defined as the slope of a stress-strain curve (i.e., Young’s modulus) was obtained by 
linear regression. Differences in elastic modulus between two groups were assessed via student’s 
t-test. For comparison among more than two groups (e.g., Tube RO, Tube MA-30, Tube HA-30), 
 13 
behavior of the scaffold. Also, the axial tensile force increased as the axial stretch ratio or luminal 
pressure increased. 
The circumferential elastic moduli of both Tube MA and Tube HA were closely related to ; 
a larger  resulted in a significantly greater circumferential elastic modulus (Figure 9A, 9B). 
There were no significant differences in elastic moduli between Tube RO and Tube MA-30, and 
between Tube RO and Tube MA-45. Yet, the elastic moduli of Tube RO and Tube HA-30 were 
significantly different. If Tube MA and Tube HA were compared (Figure 9C), Tube MA had a 
significantly greater elastic modulus than Tube HA did for =30 (p<0.01) and =45 (p<0.05) 
but not for =60. Although only data for z=1.00 were shown, the statistical results were the 
same for the other two axial stretch ratios. 
Figure 10 showed the axial tensile forces in the tubular scaffolds subjected to the three axial 
stretch ratios at 30 mmHg. Figure 10A compared the axial tensile forces in Tube RO, Tube 
MA-30, -45, and -60 under the same conditions whereas Figure 10B compared Tube RO, Tube 
HA-30, -45, and -60. For both Tube MA and Tube HA, the axial tensile force appeared to be 
greater in scaffolds with a smaller  given the same axial stretch ratio. The difference became 
more significant as the axial stretch ratio increased from 1.02 to 1.04. When Tube RO and Tube 
MA were compared, no significant differences were observed at z=1.02 and 1.04 except for Tube 
RO and Tube MA-30. On the other hand, there were significant differences between Tube RO and 
Tube HA at z=1.02 and 1.04 excluding the pair of Tube RO and Tube HA-30. Figure 11 
compared the axial mechanical behavior of Tube MA and Tube HA. When stretched axially (i.e., 
z=1.02 and 1.04) at 30 mmHg Tube MA bore a significantly greater axial tensile force than Tube 
HA did (Figure 11B, C). Nevertheless, when the scaffold remained unloaded axially and the 
luminal pressure increased to 150 mmHg, Tube HA bore a significantly greater axial tensile force 
 15 
et al., 2006; Vaz et al., 2005). In these studies, the tubular scaffolds were fabricated on 
small-diameter rotating mandrels. Perhaps because of the small diameter, the tangential velocity 
on the mandrel surface is limited and highly aligned fibers were hardly obtained. The influences 
of fiber directions and the distribution of fiber orientations on mechanical properties of 
small-diameter electrospun tubular scaffolds were thus not well investigated. Similar to our 
scaffold membrane approach, Wang et al. (2009) and Wang et al. (2011b) fabricated acellular 
nerve conduits by wrapping electrospun membranes that contain aligned fibers, taking the 
advantage of aligned electrospun fibers in guiding axon regeneration. The mechanical properties 
of the conduits, which obviously are not essential in their case, were not examined, however. In 
this study, we sought to construct a small-diameter tubular scaffold that has a similar 
microstructure to the arterial media using electrospinning. Specifically, Tube RO, Tube MA-30, 
-45 and -60, and Tube HA-30, -45 and -60 were fabricated and their biaxial mechanical 
properties were examined. 
Not surprisingly, the fiber direction in the scaffold influenced its circumferential 
mechanical behavior. A tubular scaffold, either Tube MA or Tube HA, with a larger  was 
shown to have a greater circumferential elastic modulus in comparison to another scaffold of the 
same type with a smaller . The result was consistent with that of Caves et al. (2010). Note, 
however, that their composite vessels have less than 10% fibers (the rest is elastin-like material), 
while our scaffolds were solely made of electrospun fibers. Stylianopoulos et al. (2008) used a 
multiscale computational model to simulate mechanical response of electrospun blood vessel 
scaffolds; specifically three different fiber orientations were examined: isotropic, axial, and 
circumferential. Also consistent with our results, the model predicts a linear pressure-diameter 
 17 
conditions (i.e., axial stretch ratio and luminal pressure), a tubular scaffold (either Tube MA or 
Tube HA) with a larger  bore a smaller axial tensile force in comparison to another scaffold of 
the same type with a smaller . It is not surprising that axial tensile force increased with 
increasing axial stretch ratio. Note, however, that for all the scaffolds at a constant length the 
axial tensile force increased as the luminal pressure increased. Particularly, the extent of the 
increased axial tensile force due to the increased luminal pressure was most tremendous for 
scaffolds with =30. This may be attributed to the greater circumferential expansion of the 
tubular scaffold with a smaller , which, due to the Poisson effect, may require a greater axial 
tensile force to keep the scaffold at a constant length. 
The effects of the distribution of fiber orientations were examined by comparing 
mechanical properties of Tube MA and Tube HA. Interestingly, at any tested axial stretch ratio 
Tube MA-30 and Tube MA-45 had significantly greater circumferential elastic moduli in 
comparison to Tube HA with the same . The comparison of the axial tensile forces in Tube MA 
and Tube HA, however, was complicated by the coupling effects of the axial stretching and the 
luminal pressure. When axially stretched at a low pressure, Tube MA bore a greater axial tensile 
force than Tube HA of the same  did. The axial stretching also leaded to a smaller diameter 
reduction in Tube MA-30 and Tube MA-45 compared with Tube HA of the same  (Figure 8A). 
As the luminal pressure increased, however, its contribution, probably due to the Poisson effect, 
on the axial tensile force came into play, especially for scaffolds with a smaller . Note that 
when subjected to the same pressure, Tube HA-30 and Tube HA-45 had greater circumferential 
expansions compared with Tube MA of the same  and might thus increase their axial tensile 
forces. Perhaps because of the highly aligned fibers that have little interactions among one 
another, Tube HA-30 and Tube HA-45 manifested a greater Poisson effect compared with Tube 
 19 
reported by Chen et al (2007). One another concern of using PCL, however, is due to its low 
degradation rate. Intact PCL fibers were found in histological sections after two weeks in culture; 
it may take months or years for PCL to degrade in vitro. Therefore, to better appreciate the 
potential of the scaffold membrane approach in vascular tissue engineering, a biocompatible, 
electrospinnable elastomer with controllable rate of degradation is needed. 
The scaffold membranes in this study were made by electrospinning. In addition to the 
general advantages of electrospun scaffolds, aligned electrospun fibers facilitate cell alignment 
due to contact guidance and thus have the potential to control the microstructure of engineered 
tissues, which may not be easily achieved by other fabrication technologies. Among the many 
methods for aligning electrospun fibers (Teo and Ramakrishna, 2006), collecting fibers by 
rotating drum requires simple setup and a relatively large and thick membrane, which is essential 
for the scaffold membrane approach, can be fabricated. Also note that tubular scaffolds made of 
these membranes showed subtle variations in the stress-strain behavior among the same type, 
suggesting the consistency of the rotating drum method. 
A variety of methods have been developed to enhance cell seeding in electrospun scaffolds. 
Stankus et al. (2006) “microintegrated” cells into an electrospun matrix by simultaneously 
electrospraying the cells and electrospinning the scaffold material. This approach is technically 
demanding, particularly, in terms of maintenance of sterility during the process. Pham et al. 
(2006) specifically created microfibers by electrospinning and fabricated layered scaffolds 
consisted of alternating layers of microfibers and nanofibers, capitalizing on the properties of 
both microfibers (i.e., large pores) and nanofibers (i.e., physical mimicry of extracellular matrix). 
Although cells appeared to populate well in the microfiber layers, the nanofiber layers may act as 
a physical barrier that prohibits cell migration through these layers. Baker et al. (2008) 
 21 
potentially functional three-layered TEVG can thus be achieved by sequentially wrapping 
cell-seeded membranes of each layer. On the other hand,  
3T3 fibroblasts were used as the model cell type in this study partly because they are 
readily available and easy to culture. It is smooth muscle cells that reside in the arterial media 
and play an important role in regulation of arterial caliber, however. Nevertheless, harvest of 
autologous smooth muscle cells, compared with dermal fibroblasts, generally required a more 
invasive procedure, which have been used in construction of TEVGs and proven to be effective 
in animal models (L'Heureux et al., 2006) and in humans (McAllister et al., 2009). 
In this study, we showed representative histology of the tubular tissue-engineered 
constructs cultured in a static environment. No mechanical properties of the constructs (e.g., 
burst pressure, suture retention strength, and elasticity) were reported; obviously they are very 
important measures for a vascular graft. One of our ongoing studies is to evaluate the mechanical 
properties of these constructs with a statistically meaningful sample size. In addition, a 
multiaxial dynamic bioreactor is under construction and will be used to examine the influence of 
the dynamic environment on the maturation of the tubular tissue-engineered construct. 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
We successfully fabricated a small-diameter tubular scaffold that has a similar microstructure to 
the arterial media using a scaffold membrane approach. The mechanical properties of the tubular 
scaffold can be adjusted by manipulating fiber directions and the distribution of fiber orientations 
in the scaffold. Tubular tissue-engineered constructs were prepared similarly using cell-seeded 
scaffold membranes. Histology of the construct illustrated that cells were aligned to the fiber 
directions in the construct, demonstrating the potential to control the microstructure of TEVGs

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the procedure for preparation of a tubular scaffold. First, a 
small-diameter mandrel is coated with vasaline, which helps in removal of the tubular scaffold at 
the end of the procedure. Second, a PDMS tube (wall thickness=~0.05 mm) is formed over the 
coated mandrel. Third, electrospun membranes are then wrapped onto the PDMS tube, forming a 
tubular structure. Finally the tubular scaffold is sealed with electrospun fibers and then removed 
together with the PDMS tube from the mandrel for mechanical testing. 
 
Figure 2. The top panel is a schematic drawing of the automatic wrapping device. Note that one 
end of the guide string is fixed to a pole on the sliding stage and the other end to the rotatable 
mandrel and that the rotatable mandrel does not move with respect to the base of the device. 
Prior to wrapping a membrane, a part of the guide string longer than the length of the membrane 
is rolled onto the rotatable mandrel. An edge portion of the membrane is then placed onto the 
rotatable mandrel, whereas the majority of the membrane remains on the Petri dish. As the 
sliding stage is moved via a ballscrew driven by a gear motor, the mandrel is turned by the guide 
string and hence the membrane is wrapped, forming a tubular structure. Note that the distance 
the mandrel rotates is the same as the distance that the stage moves. The bottom panel is a 
photograph of our device. The major part of the device can be sterilized by autoclave and 
assembled aseptically in a laminar flow hood. It can thus be used to wrap cell-seeded scaffold 
membranes as well.

Electrospun Scaffolds that Mimic the Microstructure of Arteries

Introduction
Atherosclerotic vascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
modern society. Although autologous native vessels remain the gold standard for small-
diameter arterial replacement, many patients do not have suitable autologous vessels for
surgery1. A variety of tissue-engineering strategies have thus been developed for functional
small-diameter arterial grafts1,2.
Previous studies show that mechanical stimuli play an important role in tissue
development and maturation3.In this study, we aimed at fabricating a compliant tubular
scaffold for tissue-engineered blood vessels that, when combined with a mechano-active
culturing system, is capable of receiving multi-axial mechanical stimuli. We hypothesized
that the microstructure of the scaffold can influence the resulting tissue4. We, therefore,
designed our scaffold based on the microstructure of native blood vessels. Among a variety
of processing techniques, electrospinning was chosen as the electrospun fibers have been
shown to be able to arrange in a certain pattern5. With a special collecting mechanism, we
fabricated the compliant tubular scaffold by electrospinning a biodegradable elastomer,
polycaprolactone (PCL). We combined the idea of cell sheet and scaffold to develop a
tubular tissue, more important, the fiber arrangements of the scaffold were designed to
mimic the microstructure ofnative arteries.
Materials andMethods
Electrospinning setup
PCL was dissolved in a mixture of
dichloromethane and N,N-dimethylformamide
(80/20; v/v) at room temperature. The
electrospinning system (Figure 1) consists of a
spinneret, a high voltage power supply, a
grounded rotating drum, and a syringe pump.
The grounded rotating drum was used to
fabricate membrane with aligned electrospun
fibers; the rotation speed of the drum was
controlled to achieve different fiber orientations.

Conclusion
We successfully fabricated a compliant tubular scaffold that has similar microstructure to
native arteries. The scaffolds with fibers aligned toward the circumferential direction showed
higher elastic moduli than those aligned toward the axial direction. On the other hand these
scaffolds with fibers aligned toward the circumferential direction appeared less stiff in the axial
direction in comparison with those fibers aligned toward the axial directions. With this special
method in our study, we already fabricated a tubular tissue which showed the similar structure
as the native blood vessels and, more important, we overcome the difficult of seeding cells into
the scaffolds of the tissue engineering vessels.

Results andDiscussion
The results showed the fiber distribution revealed by the optical microscope and SEM demonstrated that fiber
orientations with a different spectrum of distribution can be reached by changing the rotating speed of the mandrel
(Figure 2). With the special mechanism, we were able to fabricate scaffolds with similar microstructure to native
arteries. The scaffolds with different fiber orientations demonstrated different mechanical properties. Figure 5
shows the mechanical properties of the scaffolds with random fiber alignment. As we can see, in the picture of
pressure-D/D0 (diameter/diameter0) curves, the curves shift to left during the increasing of the axial stretch ratio
without slope change and the stress-strain curves demonstrate the similar results. The axial forces increased not
only with the increasing of the axial stretch ratio butalso with the increasing of the intra-luminalpressure.
Examination of the fiber orientation
Electrospun fibers were collected on cover glasses affixed to the rotating drum. Eight to
ten microphotographs of the electropun fibers were acquired and analyzed for distributions of
fiber orientations by a MATLAB routine based on a fast Fourier transform algorithm. An
alignment index (AI) was then used to quantify distributions of fiber orientations, that is, the
fraction of fibers lying within 20o of the predominant direction normalized by that of a random
distribution.Ahigher AImeans a better alignmentof the fibers (Figure 2).
Construction of the tubular scaffold
The collected PCL membranes with specific
fiber orientation was then wrapped it into a
tubular structure by a custom-made wrapping
device to create a scaffold for tissue
engineering blood vessel; particularly, we
arranged the fiber orientation of the membrane
before wrapping to mimic the microstructure of
the media ofnative arteries.(Figure 3).
Testing of the mechanical properties
The mechanical properties of the scaffolds were
evaluated by a custom-built multi-axial mechanical testing
device, which includes a syringe pump, a pressure
transducer, a loading assembling, a load cell, a stepping
motor and a CCD camera (Figure 4). LabVIEW was used
to integrate the system. This device allowed us to perform
pressure-diameter tests on a tubular structure at different
axial stretch ratios. Stress was calculated with the value
captured by the load cell. Strain was calculated with the
diameter changetraking bythe CCD camera.

Figure 3. The method of arranging the scaffold 
fiber orientation of the membrane.
Testing of the biocompatibility and the ability of aligning seeded cells
3T3 fibroblasts were cultured on the elestrospun membrane. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was
used to test the biocompatibilityof the scaffold as well as its abilityofaligning seeded cells.
The elastic moduli of scaffolds in the
circumferential direction were closely related to
the fibers orientation (Figure 7). The scaffolds
with 60° fiber alignment demonstrated significant
higher elastic modui in the circumferential
direction than those scaffolds with random, 45°
and 30° fiber orientation. As microstructure is an
important determinant for mechanical properties,
the scaffold may have potential to guide the
growth of the engineered vessel to reach the
mechanical properties of native arteries. The
scaffolds with 30° fiber alignment demonstrated
significant higher axial force during 150mmHg
intra-luminal pressure than those scaffolds with
random, 45° and 60° fiber orientation which due
to the structure different between different fiber
orientation. The scaffolds with 30° fiber alignment
present larger circumferential strain during intra-
luminal pressure increasing than scaffolds with
60° fiber alignment due to the larger inner radius
increasing.
Figure 5. The mechanical properties of the scaffolds with random fiber alignment.
Figure 6 shows the mechanical properties of the scaffolds with specific fiber alignments under medium and high
rotation speed of the drum. The slope in the pressure-D/D0 curves and stress-strain curves increased with the
increasing angle of the fiber orientations which mean the elastic moduli of scaffolds in the circumferential direction
increased with the increasing angle of the fiber orientations . The axial force increased with both the increasing of
the axial stretch ratio and the intra-luminal pressure; and the smaller angle of the fiber alignment showed larger
increasing amplitude in the axial force with the stretch ratio and intra-luminalpressure.
The SEM pictures showed that the cells could aligned to
the prescribe fiber direction (Figure 8). These results
demonstrated that the scaffold has a potential to guide cell
orientation and hence the tissue structure.
