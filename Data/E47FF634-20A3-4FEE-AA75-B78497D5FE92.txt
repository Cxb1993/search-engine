英文摘要及關鍵詞 
     This research project is to carry out “Study of Electrical Generation and Reforming of Deposited 
Carbon in Direct Methane Solid Oxide Fuel Cells”. This concerns the current development of solid oxide fuel 
cell (SOFC) and is to carry out the studies of the anode electrochemical reaction and internal reforming 
reaction with direct methane feeding. The fuels utilized for SOFC can be hydrogen or natural gas (methane). 
Since the cell efficiency with hydrogen as fuel is higher but the supply of methane is more convenient and 
also safer, most current applied researches are on the transformation of fuels such as natural gas to 
hydrogen-rich fuel via an external steam reformer. However, this increases the complexity of the cell setup 
and thus greatly increases its cost. Therefore, direct internal reforming (DIR) solid oxide fuel cells become an 
important current research subject. This DIR-SOFC can fully utilize the large amount of heat generated by 
SOFC anode electrochemical oxidation, and thus increases the heat utilization efficiency and decreases the 
emission of the green-house gases. Nevertheless, the addition of steam into SOFC for the internal reforming 
reaction is energy consuming and also increases the complexity of the cell setup. Thus, direct methane solid 
oxide fuel cell (direct methane SOFC, DM-SOFC) becomes an important foresighted research. This 
DM-SOFC avoids the addition of external steam but can fully utilize the steam produced by the anode 
electrochemical reaction, and thus can further increase the heat utilization efficiency of SOFC. However, a 
major problem exists for DM-SOFC, that is, the current generally-used anode metal is nickel (Ni) which will 
decompose methane to carbon at high temperature (such as 800~950 oC for SOFC operation). As a 
consequence, direct methane feeding to the anode will cause anode deactivation due to formation of large 
amount of deposited carbon. The purpose of this project is to study and obtain a method to solve this problem. 
     In the recent simulated study of the characteristics of anode catalysis, the laboratory of this project 
leader found that the lattice oxygen of the oxygen-ion conducting materials itself can be utilized to remove the 
deposited carbon. This has been named as ‘self de-coking”. Since the process of electricity generation of 
SOFC is the transport of the lattice oxygen, self de-coking can generate electrical current. Thus, it is proposed 
in the first year of this project to carry out “Study of electricity generation via coke”. Its purpose is to fully 
understand the electrochemical reaction characteristics of methane and the formed deposited carbon (coke) 
over generally used Ni-YSZ anode under operation of 800~950 oC in DM-SOFC. Very recently, this 
laboratory also found a new phenomenon, that is, a fuel-free current which is generated via the replenishment 
of the lattice oxygen, under fuel-free condition, due to the deficiency of the lattice oxygen concentration by 
lattice oxygen extracted, as required by coke removal, additionally from the anode-side bulk only. These will 
affect the electrochemical reaction of the anode, especially the activity difference on CO and CO2 formations, 
and thus cause a difference on the characteristics of electricity generation. Thus, it is proposed in the second 
year of this project to carry out “Study of mechanism of lattice oxygen reaction of coke”. This is expected to 
have not only academic achievement but also increased understanding of the syngas-electricity cogeneration 
characteristics. The latter is on the application characteristics of DM-SOFC to co-generate syngas (synthesis 
gas, CO/H2 = 2) and electricity. Preliminary research of this laboratory also found that DM-SOFC can have 
stable electrochemical activity when a metal current collector was used on the anode side. This indicates that 
the current collector can have the catalytic activity of internal steam reforming. Thus, a modified current 
collector with improved catalytic activity is expected to offer a method to solve the above-described problem 
of coke from methane. Thus, it is proposed in the third year of this project to carry out “Study of coke 
reforming”. This is to carry out the study of the improvement of the current collector as a catalytic layer for 
coke reforming. Since the internal reforming reaction of this project involves the electrochemical reaction 
characteristics of anode and the mechanism of transport and reaction of lattice oxygen, the third year’s “study 
of coke reforming” has to be based on the results of the first year’s “study of electricity generation via coke” 
and the second year’s “study of mechanism of lattice oxygen reaction of coke”. Therefore, the study of this 
project needs at least 3 years to be expected to obtain a method to solve the problem of deposited carbon from 
methane in DM-SOFC.

Effect of Bi2O3 content on characteristics of Bi2O3-GDC systems for direct methane 
oxidation 
 
Ta-Jen Huang *, Jia-Fu Li 
 
Abstract 
     Ceramic systems of Bi2O3 and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) solid mixture were prepared as catalysts 
for direct methane oxidation. These systems were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction using 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide, temperature-programmed reaction of methane, fixed-temperature direct 
methane oxidation, and X-ray diffraction analysis. Adding Bi2O3 to GDC promotes both hydrogen and CO 
oxidation activities, because of the presence of surface Bi2O3 and the high content of mobile oxygen in Bi2O3. 
The reactivity of CO with surface lattice oxygen is enhanced to a higher extent than that of H2, and this 
enhanced extent shows a maximum in Bi2O3 content. Such a maximum also exists for the catalytic activity of 
direct methane oxidation. A synergistic effect occurs due to a combination of the high methane reactivity of 
GDC and the high content of mobile oxygen in Bi2O3. The CO2 selectivity of direct methane oxidation can be 
 10
methane oxidation and increase methane conversion. 
The high oxygen-ion conductivity of Bi2O3 is associated with its high concentration of oxygen 
vacancies to contain bulk lattice oxygen [23]. This bulk lattice oxygen is highly mobile and can be used to 
promote the total oxidation of the deposited carbon species [8]. Restated, Bi2O3 has a high content of mobile 
oxygen [1], which can be utilized to increase the rate of direct methane oxidation. Therefore, when Bi2O3 is 
mixed with GDC, the high concentration of bulk lattice oxygen in Bi2O3 should promote the self de-coking 
capability of this ceramic system. Accordingly, when this Bi2O3-GDC system is used to catalyze direct 
methane oxidation, the coking problem can be reduced or even eliminated [8]. 
In this work, various Bi2O3-GDC systems were prepared as catalysts of direct methane oxidation in an 
attempt to take advantage of the high concentration of usable lattice oxygen in Bi2O3. Methane oxidation 
activity and the associated CO and hydrogen oxidation activities increased with the addition of Bi2O3 to GDC 
and a synergistic effect was observed. An optimal Bi2O3 content in the Bi2O3-GDC system for direct methane 
oxidation was demonstrated to exist. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Preparation of GDC and Bi2O3-GDC system 
GDC was prepared by co-precipitation. The details of the method have been described elsewhere [17]. 
Suitable amounts of gadolinium nitrate and cerium nitrate were used to yield a nominal atomic ratio of Gd:Ce 
= 1:9. The GDC powders were calcined by heating in air at a rate of 10oC/min to 800
 oC and held for 4 h 
before cooling. The GDC prepared in this work was (GdO1.5)0.1(CeO2)0.9. 
The Bi2O3-GDC system was prepared by mixing GDC and Bi2O3 powders with the designated weight 
ratio. Then, the solid mixture was calcined at 800oC for 4 h to yield the Bi2O3-GDC system. All tests were 
performed on calcined samples without pre-reduction. 
 
2.2. Temperature-programmed reduction using H2 and CO 
Temperature-programmed reduction using hydrogen (H2-TPR) and temperature-programmed reduction 
using carbon monoxide (CO-TPR) were performed at atmospheric pressure in a continuous flow reactor 
charged with 50 and 100 mg of sample catalyst, respectively. The charge was fixed by quartz wool and quartz 
sand downstream of the bed. The reactor was made of an 8-mm-ID quartz U-tube that was embedded in an 
insulated electric furnace. A K-type thermocouple was inserted into the catalyst bed to measure and control 
the bed temperature. 
H2-TPR tests were performed with 10 % H2 in Ar at a flow rate of 30 ml/min, heated from room 
temperature to the designated temperature at a rate of 10oC/min; the material was then held at that temperature 
for the designated time before cooling. Some details of the H2-TPR test have been presented elsewhere [18]. 
CO-TPR tests were performed using the same temperature program but with 1 % CO in Ar at 20 ml/min. 
 
2.3. Temperature-programmed reaction of methane 
The test of temperature-programmed reaction of methane (CH4-TPRx) was conducted using the same 
reactor setup as was used for the TPR tests; the reactor was also charged with 100 mg of sample catalyst. The 
gas feed was passed through an oxygen filter to eliminate trace amounts of oxygen. A blank test was 
performed and the results indicated that no oxygen leak occurred in this reactor system. 
 12
Table 1 show that almost all of O in Bi2O3 was consumed and so Bi2O3 should have been reduced to Bi metal 
at the end of the test. The peak temperature of Bi2O3, about 560
oC, as shown in Fig. 1, also indicates that 
Bi2O3 can be completely reduced at 780
oC in the H2-TPR test. Therefore, all of O in Bi2O3 can be extracted 
from the bulk to the surface for oxidation. 
Figure 1 also shows that the extraction of lattice oxygen species in Bi2O3 for H2 oxidation occurs at a 
much higher temperature than that in Bi2O3-GDC systems. Therefore, the reactivity of H2 with the surface 
lattice oxygen of Bi2O3 is lower than that of Bi2O3-GDC. Since the H2 reactivity of Bi2O3-GDC is also higher 
than that of GDC, the high H2 reactivity of the Bi2O3-GDC systems, as revealed by the low H2-TPR peak 
temperature, may be considered to be due to a synergistic effect between Bi2O3 and GDC. This synergistic 
effect involves a combination of the surface Bi2O3 particles and the high content of mobile oxygen in Bi2O3. 
Notably, the amount of mobile or active oxygen species in Bi2O3-GDC is less than that in Bi2O3, as revealed 
by the total amount of H2 consumption in Table 1. This is because, although GDC has high O content than 
Bi2O3, as also shown in Table 1, the amount of mobile or active oxygen species in GDC for oxidation is much 
less than that in Bi2O3. Notably, also, the amount of H2 consumption is equivalent to that of oxygen 
consumption according to the reaction of hydrogen oxidation: H2 + O → H2O. Notably, also, a higher rate of 
H2 oxidation corresponds to a larger amount of H2 consumption. Therefore, adding Bi2O3 to GDC increases 
the amount of mobile or active oxygen species in this system, increasing the H2 oxidation rate, such that the 
total amount of H2 consumption during H2-TPR increases with Bi2O3 content, as revealed in Table 1. 
Figure 4 displays the CO-TPR profiles. The peak temperature of Bi2O3-GDC is much lower than that of 
pure Bi2O3. These low-temperature peaks are also much larger than the low-temperature peak of pure GDC. 
This difference is also considered to be associated with a synergistic effect between Bi2O3 and GDC. Notably, 
a lower CO-TPR peak temperature also indicates a higher CO reactivity with the surface lattice oxygen of the 
catalyst; on the other hand, a larger peak area indicates a larger amount of the reactant, e.g. oxygen species in 
the situation of this work, which is available at the designated peak temperature; therefore, higher reactivity 
and larger reactant amount are two separate issues. Notably, also, only the surface oxygen can directly attend 
the reaction and the bulk lattice oxygen has to be transported to the surface for reaction. As also shown in Fig. 
4, the total CO-TPR peak area over Bi2O3, corresponding to the total amount of CO2 formed during CO-TPR 
over Bi2O3, is much higher than that over GDC. Therefore, the total amount of CO2 formed during CO-TPR 
increases with Bi2O3 content, as revealed in Table 1. This fact is also considered to follow from the high 
content of mobile oxygen in Bi2O3. 
Table 1 also indicates that, although the total oxygen consumption during either H2-TPR or CO-TPR 
increases with the addition of Bi2O3 to GDC, the consumption of oxygen during CO-TPR is always higher 
than that during H2-TPR. Notably, both H2 consumption and CO2 formation during TPR analyses are 
equivalent to oxygen consumption; CO2 formation during CO-TPR is via CO oxidation by the oxygen species 
in the catalyst: CO + O → CO2. Since the consumptions of oxygen from Bi2O3 during H2-TPR and CO-TPR 
are about equal, the higher oxygen consumption of Bi2O3-GDC should be attributed to GDC. Dividing the 
total amount of CO2 formed during CO-TPR by that of H2 consumed during H2-TPR yields a ratio for GDC 
that markedly exceeds that for Bi2O3, as indicated in Table 1. Notably, this ratio shows a comparison of the 
overall reactivity of CO oxidation to that of H2 oxidation. This indicates that the reactivity of CO with the 
surface lattice oxygen is higher than that of hydrogen, because the surface OH species formed by H2 oxidation 
can have an inhibition effect on the reactivity [17]. Additionally, this ratio reaches a maximum at about 20 
 14
Bi2O3 is relatively low and so the methane activity of Bi2O3-GDC should drop as the Bi2O3 content increases 
over a certain threshold as it is added to GDC and a maximum should be reached. Table 2 indicates that this 
maximum is at about 25 wt% Bi2O3. Notably, also, the rate of CO2 formation declines at a Bi2O3 content of 
around 70 to 100 wt% Bi2O3, reaching finally a very low level over pure Bi2O3. This is because insufficient 
GDC is present over the surface to adsorb methane and thus take advantage of the high oxygen-ion 
conductivity and the high oxygen content of Bi2O3. 
A comparison of Table 1 and Table 2 reveals that the variation in methane oxidation activity, in terms of 
carbon oxides formation, is similar to that of the ratio of CO-TPR to H2-TPR. This may be because the 
interaction of CH4 with the surface active site is similar to that of CO, possibly via the C interaction. This 
interaction can be modulated by varying the Bi2O3 content in the Bi2O3-GDC system and thus the activity 
reaches a maximum in a particular Bi2O3 content. 
The BET areas of GDC, 25 wt% Bi2O3-GDC and Bi2O3 were determined to be 58, 47 and 38 m2/g, 
respectively. Thus, the much higher methane oxidation activity over 25 wt% Bi2O3-GDC is not associated 
with a higher surface area. Therefore, the above-observed synergistic effect on the Bi2O3-GDC system should 
be associated with a combination of the high methane reactivity of GDC and the high content of mobile 
oxygen of Bi2O3. The methane oxidation activity increases as Bi2O3 is added to GDC because of this 
synergistic effect. On the other hand, although the Bi species can be present at the surface to promote the 
supply of the oxygen species for direct methane oxidation, a larger amount of surface Bi species is associated 
with a lower amount of surface GDC, so the methane oxidation activity is low because of the relatively low 
methane reactivity of the Bi species, Bi2O3 or the Bi metal, as indicated above. Therefore, the methane 
reactivity and the oxygen supply ability should come to balance with an intermediate Bi2O3 content, verifying 
the existence of a maximum in methane oxidation activity. 
Table 2 also indicates that both the amount of CO2 formation and the CO2 selectivity increase with 
Bi2O3 content, because of the high content of mobile oxygen in Bi2O3. The extent of the increase in CO2 
formation is much higher than that of methane oxidation activity, as determined by the amount of carbon 
oxides formed. Therefore, adding Bi2O3 to GDC can increase both CO2 selectivity and methane oxidation 
activity until a Bi2O3 content of about 25% is reached. The above results demonstrate that the CO2 selectivity 
of the Bi2O3-GDC system can be modulated by varying the Bi2O3 content. 
 
3.3. Fixed-temperature activities for direct methane oxidation 
Fixed-temperature tests of the activities of Bi2O3-GDC systems for direct methane oxidation at 780
oC 
were performed to verify that the results of the temperature-programmed tests are applicable for isothermal 
operation; this test temperature was set by considering intermediate-temperature SOFCs and the melting point 
of Bi2O3 at 824
oC. Notably, Bi2O3 can be reduced to Bi metal at temperatures of over 560
oC, which is the 
H2-TPR peak temperature. However, EDX analysis over a 600
oC-reduced Bi2O3-GDC sample, as reported in 
section 3.1, indicates the association of elemental O with surface Bi element. This suggests that the lattice 
oxygen of GDC can be supplemented to the surface Bi species to maintain its role as an oxygen storage 
component. Therefore, the Bi species is adopted to take advantage of the high oxygen-ion conductivity and 
the high content of mobile oxygen of bismuth oxide. 
As shown in Fig. 7, the 25 wt% Bi2O3-GDC system has the highest methane activity, which results is 
consistent with the CH4-TPRx results discussed above. The initial jump in the methane activity is considered 
 16
(3) The Bi2O3-GDC system exhibits a synergistic effect, because of a combination of the high methane 
reactivity of GDC and the high content of mobile oxygen in Bi2O3. 
(4) The CO2 selectivity in direct methane oxidation can be modulated by varying the Bi2O3 content. 
(5) The mixing of Bi2O3 with GDC increases the self de-coking capability of the catalyst during direct 
methane oxidation, which stabilizes the activity.

FeCr gas diffusion layer with surface modification for fuel processing in direct-methane 
solid oxide fuel cells 
 
Ta-Jen Huang*, Meng-Chin Huang 
 
Abstract 
A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with an Ni-YSZ anode was tested both without and with porous FeCr 
disk as a gas diffusion layer (GDL) under direct methane feeding. The surface of GDL was modified by 
coating with YSZ or Ni-YSZ powders. When gold mesh was used as the current collector, the performance of 
the direct-methane SOFC degraded very quickly. When FeCr GDL was used as the current collector over the 
anode, the performance became better and stable. Surface modification of GDL increased the current density. 
Both in GDL and over the anode, the major methane reaction was CH4 dissociation, which yielded C species. 
The C species produced in GDL can be removed via gasification by carbon dioxide that forms over the anode. 
The formation of CO2 can become the major reaction in the GDL of FeCr+YSZ while that of CO is the major 
reaction in the GDL of either FeCr or FeCr+Ni-YSZ. The electrochemical oxidation of CO formed in GDL 
increases the current density. The electrochemical promotion of lattice-oxygen extraction promotes the 
oxidation of CO and C species over the anode.

1. Introduction 
Methane has become an important fuel for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Hence, considerable research 
effort has been made into the conversion of methane fuel into hydrogen-rich gas, as required by the 
electrochemical reaction on the anode. Recently, internal reforming SOFCs have attracted substantial attention 
since they can eliminate the requirement for a separate fuel reformer and also markedly reduce the need for 
cell cooling, which is usually performed by the flow of excess air through the cathode [1]. Depending on the 
operating conditions, the heat consumed by internal reforming can vary from 40 to 70% of the total heat 
produced in a fuel cell [2]. Therefore, internal reforming SOFC is an energy-efficient system design. However, 
carbon deposition over the usual Ni-cermet anode is a well-known problem when methane is used as fuel. 
Although the carbon deposition problem may be overcome by adding sufficient steam into the fuel stream, 
dilution of the fuel by the steam becomes a problem [2]; also, extra heating energy is required to generate the 
steam. Direct-methane SOFCs with either an inert porous layer [3] or a catalytic layer [4] placed between the 
anode and the fuel stream have potential to solve the problem of carbon deposition. 
Methane decomposes over the Ni-cermet anodes in direct-methane SOFCs [5,6]. Methane 
decomposition over Ni is usually considered as proceeding as CH4 → CH3 + H → CH2 + H2 → CH + H + H2 
→ C + 2 H2. At high temperatures, such as 800
oC, CH4 → C + 2 H2 may occur directly, as in the thermal 
cracking of methane. Thus, the decomposition of methane over Ni generally causes the deposition of carbon 
(coking) [7], potentially causing very rapid deactivation of the SOFC anode; consequently, the removal of the 
 26
electrolyte-supported cell. A disk with a diameter of 1.25 cm was cut from the tape. One side of the disk was 
coated with the Ni-YSZ paste, which was made of the above Ni-YSZ powder, corn oil, polyvinyl butyral and 
ethanol. The other side of the disk was screen-printed with a thin layer of Pt paste (Heraeus, C3605P) to make 
the cathode layer. 
The method by which the Ni-YSZ paste was coated on the YSZ disk to make the anode layer has been 
described elsewhere [9]. The thus-prepared unit cell has an anode area of 1 cm2, an anode thickness of about 
30 µm, an electrolyte thickness of 156 µm, a cathode area of 1 cm2 and a cathode thickness of about 5 µm. 
These thicknesses were measured from a scanning electron micrograph plot of the cross section of the unit 
cell. 
Both sides of the completed unit cell were connected, respectively, to gold mesh wires (100 mesh), or to 
the FeCr disk on the anode side, to collect the current, and then using Pt wires to the current and voltage 
measurement units. The ceramic paste was used to seal the unit cell in a quartz tube with heat treatment at 
400oC for 1.5 h to complete the preparation of the test unit. The anode side of the unit cell was sealed in a 
quartz tube and the cathode side was exposed to stagnant air. 
 
2.4. Activity tests of unit cell 
A voltage of 0.61 V was maintained during all tests in this work. The test temperature was fixed at 
800oC. The fuel to the anode side was 10.5% methane (CH4) in argon; for reduction, the feed to the anode side 
was 10% H2 in argon. The flow rate past the anode side was always 100 ml min-1. 
The test started with the reduction of the anode at 400oC in 10% H2 for 1 h. Then, a pure argon flow 
was used to purge the system for 2 h. The test unit was then heated in argon to 800oC at a rate of 5oC/min. 
Then, 10% H2 was introduced for 30 min and argon flow continued until the measured electrical current 
became zero. A direct-methane SOFC test was then performed with the introduction of 10.5% CH4 flow for 
360 min. Then, the anode-side flow was switched to argon. 
During the test, electrical current, voltage and outlet gas compositions were continuously measured. 
The CO and CO2 contents were measured by CO-NDIR and CO2–NDIR (non-dispersive infrared analyzer, 
Beckman 880), respectively. Other gas compositions were measured using two gas chromatographs (China 
Chromatography 8900) in series. 
 
3. Results 
3.1. Effect of FeCr gas diffusion layer on DM-SOFC performance 
Fig. 1 shows the results of a direct-methane SOFC without a gas diffusion layer - that is, with gold 
mesh as the current collector over the anode side. The methane conversion rate decreases continuously with 
the operation time, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 1(a) also shows that, before about 150 min, the methane 
conversion rate exceeded the (CO+CO2) formation rate, indicating the deposition of carbon species over the 
anode. The formation of the deposited C species is revealed by the carbon balance: 
∆CH4 - ∆(CO+CO2) = ∆C                                        (1) 
where ∆CH4 is the methane conversion rate, ∆(CO+CO2) is the rate of formation of CO plus CO2, and ∆C is 
the rate of formation of the deposited C species. 
Fig. 1(a) also shows that, except during the first 10 min of SOFC operation, no H2O is formed, 
indicating that the major reaction of CH4 during DM-SOFC operation is the dissociation of methane: 
 28
the equivalent current and the measured current, and extends from time zero until the meeting of these two 
curves; zone II denotes the area under the curve of the measured current to the right of the curve of the 
equivalent current, and zone III denotes the area under the curve of equivalent current during Ar flow. 
According to Huang and Huang [9,16-18], in an SOFC unit without GDL, in zone I, lattice-oxygen 
extraction is electrochemically promoted to oxidize the carbon species and in zone II, the extracted lattice 
oxygen is replenished by the oxygen species from the cathode via the electrolyte; this oxygen replenishment 
results in a fuel-free current [9]. Additionally, zone III arises from the removal of the deposited carbon species 
via gasification by oxidation [18]. However, in DM-SOFCs with GDL as the current collector, the 
electrochemical promotion of lattice-oxygen extraction for the oxidation of the carbon species may occur at 
both the anode and the GDL. Therefore, the materials for modifying the surface of GDL can change the 
reaction behavior, as indicated by the variation in zone I behavior with surface modification, as shown in Fig. 
4. The Discussion section will clarify the effect of these differences in association with the reactions over the 
anode and in GDL. 
 
3.4. CO and CO2 formation rates 
For methane reactions in direct-methane SOFCs, the formation of only CO and not CO2 should result in 
a large variation in the fuel efficiency for power generation, because the electrochemical formation of CO2 
involves four electrons, while that of CO involves only two electrons, with each oxygen ion’s carrying two 
electrons; thus, the current density associated with the formation of CO2 is two times that associated with the 
formation of CO as measured by the utilization of carbon in methane. Fig. 5 presents the rates of formation of 
CO and CO2 in DM-SOFCs with FeCr GDL without and with surface modification. The rate of CO2 
formation changes considerably, especially upon surface modification by oxygen-ion conducting materials of 
YSZ. 
Fig. 5(b) shows that, in the operation of the SOFC unit with a GDL of FeCr+YSZ, there is mainly CO2 
formation in the first 90 min, with no CO formation or with the formation of much less CO. However, in the 
SOFC unit with GDL of either FeCr or FeCr+Ni-YSZ, mainly CO is formed in the first 90 min of operation. 
This difference between the formations of CO2 and CO is determined by the presence of YSZ, which has an 
oxygen storage capacity because its bulk oxygen vacancies, which contain lattice oxygen. The Discussion 
section will explain this fact in association with the major reactions in GDL and over the anode. 
 
4. Discussion 
4.1. Reactions in GDL and over the anode 
According to the above results, the major reaction of methane is its dissociation (2), which occurs not 
only over the anode but also in GDL, as presented in Fig. 6. Notably, the proposed reaction schemes show 
only how a stable SOFC performance may be achieved; since many interconnecting reactions are involved, 
complete reaction schemes demand further study. 
Figs. 3 to 5 show that the behavior of SOFC with the GDL of FeCr+Ni-YSZ is similar to that with the 
GDL of FeCr but different from that with the GDL of FeCr+YSZ, respectively, because Ni-YSZ consists of 60 
wt% Ni, which should cover most of the YSZ surface; thus, the function of the lattice oxygen of YSZ in 
Ni-YSZ powder should be much lower than that of pure YSZ powder for the GDL of FeCr+YSZ, such that 
either FeCr or FeCr+Ni-YSZ can be considered to consist mainly of metal surface. Therefore, the type of 
 30
exactly the same CH4 conversion, the SOFC unit with the GDL of FeCr+YSZ has a higher current density 
than that of FeCr, because the lattice oxygen of YSZ, which enhances the rate of the formation of CO, 
according to reaction (6); this enhanced rate of CO formation results in an enhanced current density, according 
to reaction (9). Notably, with the same rate of CH4 conversion but without reaction (9), the current density in 
the SOFC unit with GDL of FeCr+YSZ cannot be distinguished from that of FeCr since both SOFC units 
have the same anode; that is, the electrochemical activity of the anode should be the same and thus the current 
density would be the same for the same CH4 conversion. 
In GDL and over the anode, other reactions may also occur. Notably, the CO2 reforming of methane 
occurs in GDL with surface modification by YSZ, which contains oxygen vacancy and lattice oxygen. 
Notably, the CO2 reforming of methane consists of the dissociation of methane and CO2 as well as the 
gasification of the surface carbon species by lattice oxygen [20], which are reactions (2) and (6) to (8). These 
reactions occur in GDL with YSZ surface, as shown in Fig. 6(b); thus, the CO2 reforming of methane can 
occur in GDL. 
 
4.2. Behavior of CO and CO2 formation 
For the SOFC unit with a GDL of FeCr+YSZ, the behavior of the formation of mainly CO2 during the 
period when mainly CO is formed in FeCr or FeCr+Ni-YSZ, both having mainly metal surface, is also 
considered to be due to the lattice oxygen of YSZ. However, the metal surface can be oxidized and lattice 
oxygen can exist for the oxidation of the deposited C species, so reactions (6) and (7) can occur; nevertheless, 
the extent of reactions (6) and (7) should be much less than those over the surface of YSZ, which has a high 
oxygen storage capacity; thus, reactions (6) and (7) are not the major reactions in GDL with a metal surface 
and are not presented in Fig. 6(a). Therefore, the formation of CO2 becomes the major reaction in FeCr+YSZ 
while the formation of CO is the major reaction in both FeCr and FeCr+Ni-YSZ, as shown in Fig. 5. 
Although reaction (8) can oxidize the metal to store some oxygen species in both FeCr and 
FeCr+Ni-YSZ, the oxygen storage capacity of YSZ increases the concentration of oxygen species in 
FeCr+YSZ, promoting the formation of CO2. Thus, CO2 selectivity can increase. Table 1 shows that, in the 
steady state, CO2 selectivity associated with FeCr+YSZ exceeds that associated with either FeCr or 
FeCr+Ni-YSZ. In FeCr+Ni-YSZ, the YSZ surface is covered by the high Ni loading such that its YSZ 
function is limited; the high loading of Ni results in a high rate of methane conversion, as also shown in Table 
1, leading to a large amount of carbon deposition, reducing CO2 selectivity due to limited oxygen supply. 
 
4.3. Electrochemical promotion of lattice-oxygen extraction 
The variation in zone I behavior with surface modification, as shown in Fig. 4 can also be explained by 
the oxygen storage capacity of YSZ. As described above, the formation of CO2 is enhanced by the oxygen 
storage capacity of YSZ. Thus, less CO is carried to the anode to be oxidized electrochemically by the oxygen 
ion via reaction (9). However, CO can also be oxidized by extracting the lattice-oxygen species of the 
anode-side electrolyte materials; this lattice-oxygen extraction is due to the effect of electrochemical 
promotion [9,16-18]. Less CO over the anode may result in less lattice-oxygen extraction. Therefore, the 
SOFC unit with a GDL of FeCr-YSZ exhibits less lattice-oxygen extraction than either FeCr or FeCr+Ni-YSZ 
in the first 60 min of operation, as shown in Fig. 4. 
Since the total amount of electrochemically-promoted lattice-oxygen extraction is limited [18,21], the

Effect of addition method of gadolinia-doped ceria-added FeCr gas diffusion layer on 
performance of direct-methane solid oxide fuel cells 
 
Meng-Chin Huang, Ta-Jen Huang* 
 
Abstract 
A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was set up with a porous disk of gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC)-added 
FeCr as a gas diffusion layer under direct-methane feeding. The addition of GDC was done by mixing GDC 
powder with FeCr powder before disk fabrication, or by coating GDC powder or impregnating GDC 
precursor to the surface of the porous FeCr disk. When GDC was added by mixing, the direct-methane SOFC 
(DM-SOFC) performance degraded very rapidly. When GDC was added by either powder coating or 
impregnating, the DM-SOFC performance can be relatively stable. Both the current density and the CO2 
selectivity with GDC addition by impregnating are larger than those by powder coating.

1. Introduction 
Methane is an important fuel for the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). A great deal of research efforts have 
been put on the conversion of methane fuel into hydrogen-rich gas as required for the electrochemical reaction 
on the anode. Recently, the SOFCs with internal reforming, either direct or indirect internal reforming [1-3], 
have attracted much attention since the requirement for a separate fuel reformer can thus be eliminated and the 
efficiency is increased by effective utilization of the waste heat. Depending on the operating conditions, the 
heat consumed by internal reforming can vary from 40 to 70% of the total heat produced in a fuel cell [1]. 
Therefore, internal reforming SOFC is energy efficient. However, over the usual Ni anode, coking is a 
well-known problem when methane is used as the fuel. Although the coking problem may be overcome by 
adding enough steam into the fuel stream, the dilution of the fuel by the steam becomes a problem [1] in 
addition to the extra heating energy required to produce the steam. The direct-methane SOFCs (DM-SOFCs) 
with either an inert porous layer [4] or a catalytic layer [5] placed between the anode and the fuel stream is 
promising to reduce or even solve the coking problem. 
Methane decomposition occurs over the Ni anode in DM-SOFCs [6-9]. At high temperatures, methane 
may decompose to produce the C species, the reaction being CH4 → C + 2 H2. The deposition of the C species 
over Ni may cause coking [10], which can cause very rapid deactivation of the SOFC anode; consequently, 
the removal of the deposited carbon should be important. However, a carbon SOFC has been proposed to 
utilize the deposited carbon as a fuel [11]. Huang and Huang [12] have confirmed that the deposited carbon 
can be fully utilized for the generation of the electrical current in DM-SOFCs. 
The FeCr alloy can be used as the interconnect materials for intermediate temperature SOFCs [13]. 
Thus, FeCr can be utilized as the current collector over the SOFC anode. A porous FeCr disk has been used as 
 42
electrolyte-supported cell. A disk of 1.25 cm diameter was cut from the tape. One side of the disk was coated 
with the Ni-YSZ paste, which was made of 60 wt% Ni-YSZ powder, corn oil, polyvinyl butyral and ethanol. 
The other side of the disk was screen-printed with a thin layer of Pt paste (Heraeus, C3605P) to make the 
cathode layer. 
The method of the coating of the Ni-YSZ paste to make the anode layer has been described elsewhere 
[12]. The thus-prepared unit cell has an anode area of 1 cm2, an anode thickness of about 30 µm, an 
electrolyte thickness of 156 µm, a cathode area of 1 cm2 and a cathode thickness of about 5 µm. These 
thicknesses were measured from a scanning electron micrograph plot of the cross section of the unit cell. 
The unit cell were closely connected with the GDC-added FeCr disk on the anode side for current 
collection and then with the Pt wires to the current and voltage measurement unit. The ceramic paste was used 
to seal the unit cell in a quartz tube with a heat treatment of 400 oC for 1.5 h so as to complete the preparation 
of the test unit with a single cell. The anode side of the unit cell was sealed in the quartz tube and the cathode 
side was exposed to the stagnant air. 
 
2.3. Activity tests of unit cell 
A voltage of 0.61V was maintained for all tests in this work. The test temperature was fixed at 800 oC. 
For reduction, the feed to the anode side was 10% H2 in argon. For the H2 test, the fuel to the anode side was 
10% H2 in argon. For the direct-methane test, the fuel to the anode side was 10.5-70 % methane in argon. The 
flow rate was always 100 ml/min passing the anode side. 
The test started with the reduction of the anode at 400 oC in 10% H2 for 1 h. Then, pure argon flow was 
passed for 2 h to purge the system. The test unit was then heated in argon to 800 oC at a rate of 5 oC/min. Then, 
10% H2 was introduced for 30 min to carry out the H2 test; pure argon flow was then introduced until the 
measured electrical current became zero. The DM-SOFC test was then carried out with introducing methane 
fuel flow for 360 min. Then, the anode-side flow was switched to pure argon. 
During the test, the electrical current, the voltage, and the outlet gas compositions were always 
measured. The compositions of CO and CO2 were measured by CO-NDIR and CO2-NDIR (non-dispersive 
infrared analyzer, Beckman 880), respectively. Other gas compositions were measured by two gas 
chromatographs (China Chromatography 8900) in series. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Effect of addition method on current density 
Fig. 1 shows the H2-test results of the SOFCs with various GDC-added FeCr disks as GDLs. The 
steady-state current densities were obtained in all cases and had the same value. This indicates that the method 
of GDC addition to modify the FeCr GDLs does not affect the performance of the hydrogen-fed SOFCs. This 
is due to the fact that the SOFCs with hydrogen as the fuel do not need fuel processing. Therefore, the FeCr 
GDLs functioned only as the current collector. It is also confirmed that the method of GDC addition does not 
affect the property of the FeCr GDLs for the current collection. 
Fig. 2 shows that, the method of GDC addition to the GDLs can affect the DM-SOFC performance 
quite largely. This is due to the fact that the SOFCs with direct methane feeding need fuel processing, which 
means internal methane processing in this work, to avoid or reduce the extent of anode coking [14]. Notably, 
internal methane processing means that methane is internally reformed by the oxidized products formed over 
 44
CHx → C + (x/2) H2                                            (1) 
CH4 → C + 2H2                                                (2) 
Notably, ∆H2 equals 2∆CH4 if only reaction (2) occurs. If ∆H2 is much larger than 2∆CH4, a considerable 
amount of CHx species should have been formed over the anode of the DM-SOFCs with the GDL of GDC 
addition by mixing. If either the CHx or the C species is not oxidized to form CO and/or CO2 soon enough, the 
coke could be formed. The formed coke covers the anode surface and degrades the SOFC performance. 
Notably, also, the deposited carbon has been observed visually in the GDL and over the anode in every used 
SOFC unit. 
Fig. 3b shows that, in the SOFCs with the GDL of GDC addition by powder coating, ∆H2 is smaller 
than 2∆CH4 before about 60 min of the SOFC operation. This indicates the formation of the CHx species with 
x ≠ 0 by CH4 dissociation. Then, ∆H2 > 2∆CH4 occurs. However, with GDC addition by powder coating, the 
extent of ∆H2 being larger than 2∆CH4 is much smaller than that by mixing, indicating that the amount of CHx 
formed is much smaller. This extent is even smaller with GDC addition by impregnating, as shown in Fig. 3c. 
According to the above discussion, the removal of the CHx species needs one more reaction than that of the C 
species and thus the former would be more difficult than the latter. This may explain why the DM-SOFCs 
with the GDL of GDC addition by mixing degrades very rapidly but that by either powder coating or 
impregnating does not. 
Methane can dissociate to produce the C species, via reaction (2), without forming the CHx species. 
Notably, the occurrence of reaction (2) leads to ∆H2 = 2∆CH4; this is confirmed by the results for the SOFCs 
with the GDL of GDC addition by either powder coating or impregnating, as shown in Table 1. Additionally, 
the above discussion indicates that the formation of the CHx species is minor in these DM-SOFCs. Therefore, 
in these DM-SOFCs, methane dissociation to produce the C species via reaction (2) is the major reaction. 
Fig. 3b also shows that, in the SOFCs with the GDL of GDC addition by powder coating, the CH4 
conversion rate can be larger than the (CO+CO2) formation rate. This indicates the deposition of the C species, 
i.e. ∆C ≠ 0: 
∆C = ∆CH4 - ∆(CO+CO2)                                       (3) where ∆C is the rate of 
formation of the deposited C species and ∆(CO+CO2) is the rate of formation of CO and CO2. Notably, Fig. 
3a shows that there can be ∆(CO+CO2) > ∆CH4; this indicates the oxidation of the previously deposited C 
species to form the carbon oxides. 
The C species produced by methane dissociation over the anode can react electrochemically with the 
oxygen-ion species (O2-) from the cathode to produce CO2 and CO [18]: 
C + 2O2- → CO2 + 4e-                                          (4) 
C + O2- → CO + 2e-                                            (5) 
In the GDL, the C species can be oxidized by the O species, the lattice oxygen species of GDC, via the 
following de-coking reactions [14]: 
C + 2O → CO2                                                (6) 
C + O → CO                                                  (7) 
Thus, the methane conversion rate can be equal to the (CO+CO2) formation rate – that is, ∆CH4 = ∆(CO+CO2) 
and thus ∆C = 0: Fig. 3c shows that this is the general case in the SOFCs with the GDL of GDC addition by 
impregnating. A comparison between Figs. 3b and 3c shows that the extent of ∆CH4 being larger than 
∆(CO+CO2) in the GDL with GDC addition by impregnating is much smaller than that by powder coating.

impregnating are larger than those by powder coating.

formation rates of CO2 and CO were observed. Both the methane concentration and the addition of Ni onto 
the anode showed strong effects on these oscillations. A mechanism of periodic oxidation-reduction of the 
bulk lattice of the anode was proposed to explain the occurrence of the oscillation of the electrical current, 
with the determining factor being the build-up of the concentration of the oxygen vacancies to a certain 
extent. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Preparation of Ni-added LSCF-GDC powder 
LSCF was prepared by glycine-nitrate process. Appropriate amounts of reagent-grade (Showa, Japan) 
metal nitrates La(NO3)3·6H2O, Sr(NO3)2, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in de-ionized 
water. Glycine (Sigma, USA) was also dissolved in de-ionized water. Then, these two solutions were mixed 
with glycine to NO3 ratio of 1:0.8. The mixture was heated under stirring until combustion occurred. The 
product was ground to powders and then calcined by heating at 10 oC/min to 400 oC and held for 2 h, then at 5 
oC/min to 850 oC and held for 2 h. LSCF of this work is La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ. 
Gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) was prepared by co-precipitation. The details of the method have been 
presented elsewhere [14]. The GDC powders were calcined by heating at 10 oC/min to 500 oC and held for 2 h, 
and then at 5 oC/min to 1000 oC and held for 2 h. GDC of this work is Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95-δ. 
The LSCF-GDC composite was prepared by mixing the above-prepared LSCF and GDC powders at 
LSCF:GDC=60:100 in weight. The mixture was ground for 24 h, then calcined by heating at 5 oC/min to 500 
oC and held for 2 h, and then at 5 oC/min to 900 oC, held for 10 h. 
The addition of Ni onto LSCF-GDC was done by impregnation. The details of the method have been 
presented elsewhere [15]. After drying, the powders were calcined by heating at 10 oC/min to 400
 oC and held 
for 2 h, and then at 5 oC/min to 850oC and held for 2 h. Ni-added LSCF-GDC of this work has a Ni loading of 
3 wt% with respect to the weight of LSCF in the LSCF-GDC composite, designated as Ni-LSCF-GDC. 
 
2.2. Construction of the SOFC unit 
The commercial yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) tape (156 µm thickness, Jiuhow, Taiwan) was 
employed to make an electrolyte-supported cell. A disk of 1.25 cm diameter was cut from the YSZ tape. One 
side of the disk was spin-coated with the paste made of various anode materials. The other side of the disk 
was spin-coated with 100LSCF-50GDC and then 2Ag-100LSCF-50GDC powders to make the cathode layer. 
The details of the construction of the SOFC unit cell have been presented elsewhere [6]. The thus-prepared 
unit cell has an anode area of 1 cm2, an anode thickness of about 30 µm, an electrolyte thickness of 156 µm, a 
cathode area of 1 cm2, and a cathode thickness of about 12 µm. These thicknesses were measured from a 
scanning electron micrograph plot of the cross section of the unit cell. 
Fig. 1 shows a sketch of the reactor setup of the SOFC unit cell and a scanning electron microscope 
(SEM) view of the cathode/electrolyte cross-section. Both sides of the completed unit cell were closely 
connected with gold mesh wires (100 mesh) for current collection and then with Pt wires to the current and 
voltage measurement units. The ceramic paste was used to seal the unit cell in a quartz tube with a heat 
treatment of 400 oC for 1.5 h so as to complete the preparation of the test unit with a single cell. The anode 
side of the unit cell is sealed in the quartz tube and the cathode side is exposed to stagnant air.

frequently observed [7-10]. This rate oscillation has been attributed to periodic oxidation-reduction of the Ni 
surface [11], with the involvement of the oxygen content of the bulk Ni phase and the deposited carbon [12]. 
This is in agreement with the observation that a substantial amount of oxygen and carbon is stored and 
evolved by the catalysts during the oscillatory process [9]. Therefore, for methane oxidation over the SOFC 
anodes, the occurrence of the oscillation of the electrical current may be attributed to periodic 
oxidation-reduction of the bulk lattice of the anode. 
The reduction of the anode bulk is due to the extraction of the lattice oxygen from the bulk of the 
oxygen-ion containing materials, LSCF-GDC in this work, for the oxidation of the surface C species produced 
by the dissociation of methane; this is a phenomenon similar to self de-coking [16]. Notably, in 
direct-methane SOFCs and via comparison of open circuit voltages with Nerst potentials, the formation of 
surface C species from methane and its partial oxidation have been proposed as the main anode reactions [17]. 
Notably, also, the reduction of the anode bulk results in the formation of the oxygen vacancies. Then, the 
oxidation of the anode bulk is due to the replenishment of the O species from the cathode side, which 
generates the electrical current; these O species fill the oxygen vacancies in the anode bulk so as to recover 
the concentration of the lattice oxygen to its original level. Thus, the occurrence of the oscillation of the 
electrical current during direct methane oxidation is associated with an anode reaction mechanism of: 
1. Methane dissociation to produce the surface C species. 
2. The oxidation of the surface C species. The needed O species is suplied by extracting from the bulk 
lattice of the anode; this extraction produces the oxygen vacancies in the anode bulk. The O species is also 
supplied by transporting from the cathode side via the electrolyte. 
3. Build-up of the concentration of the oxygen vacancies in the anode bulk. 
4. The replenishment of the O species from the cathode side to fill the oxygen vacancies in the anode 
bulk so as to recover the concentration of the lattice oxygen of the anode bulk to its original level. 
Since the above steps 1, 2 and 4 always occur but the oscillation of the electrical current may not occur, 
the step 3 should be determining. Thus, the build-up of the concentration of the oxygen vacancies in the anode 
bulk to a certain extent should be a determining factor for a measurable oscillation of the electrical current. 
This extent depends on the rate of the reduction of the anode bulk, which in turn depends on the concentration 
of the surface C species. This is in agreement with the above observation that higher methane concentration, 
which results in higher rate of formation of the surface C species, has higher possibility to induce an 
oscillation of the electrical current. Thus, the occurrence of the oscillation of the electrical current should be 
due to the build-up of the concentration of the oxygen vacancies to a certain extent in the above mechanism of 
periodic oxidation-reduction of the anode bulk lattice. Notably, the oscillation starts with an increase of the 
current density, as shown in Fig. 2(b) with 70% CH4 for example – that is, the oxidation of the anode bulk, the 
step 4 in the above mechanism, starts first. This is an evidence supporting the above mechanism with the 
determining factor for the oscillation of the electrical current. Then, the extraction of lattice oxygen from the 
anode bulk, the step 2 in the above mechanism, occurs; this does not generate an electrical current and thus 
the current density decreases to the steady state value, as also shown in Fig. 2. 
LSCF used as the anode may be reduced after initial contact with the fuel; this is the extraction of the O 
species from the bulk lattice of the anode according to the step 2 of the above mechanism. However, LSCF is 
re-oxidized by the oxygen coming from the cathode side during the SOFC operation; this is the replenishment 
of the O species from the cathode side as in the step 4 of the above mechanism. Therefore, LSCF would not 
 56
The extraction of the lattice oxygen produces the oxygen vacancy [20], which can be replenished by 
oxygen from the cathode side; this generates an electrical current [6]. Therefore, in association with the initial 
jump-up of the CO rate with 10% CH4 over the LSCF-GDC anode, the current density is at its highest point 
initially, as also shown in Fig. 2(a). However, some of the oxygen vacancies can not be replenished soon 
enough due to the oxygen mobility and thus a build-up of the concentration of the oxygen vacancies in the 
anode bulk occurs. When this concentration comes to a certain extent, an oscillation of the electrical current 
occurs, as also shown in Fig. 2(a). This is another evidence supporting the mechanism of periodic 
oxidation-reduction of the anode bulk lattice with the specified determining factor for the oscillation of the 
electrical current. Notably, an oscillation of the CO rate also occurs, as shown in Fig. 3(a); however, there is 
no oscillation of the CO2 rate. On the other hand, with 10% CH4 over the Ni-LSCF-GDC anode, there is an 
oscillation of the CO2 rate but no measurable oscillation of either the electrical current or the CO rate, as 
shown in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b). The oscillation of only the CO2 rate belongs to a case similar to that of methane 
oxidation over the Ni catalysts [10] and thus the oscillation of the CO2 rate may be explained by periodic 
oxidation-reduction of the Ni surface [11]. 
Since the formation of CO2 needs two O species while that of CO needs only one, it would be easier for 
the oscillation of the formation rate of CO to occur than that of CO2 when a certain extent of the deficiency of 
the lattice-oxygen concentration occurs. Fig. 3(a) shows that, with 10% CH4 over the LSCF-GDC anode, the 
formation rate of CO has irregular oscillation but that of CO2 does not have any oscillation. However, Fig. 3(b) 
shows that, over the Ni-LSCF-GDC anode, there is almost no measurable oscillation of the CO rate but a 
regular oscillation of the CO2 rate occurs right after an induction period of about 45 min of operation. 
Therefore, the addition of Ni, a well-known metal with high activity for CH4 dissociation to form the 
deposited C species, promotes the occurence of the oscillation of the rate of CO2 formation. 
Fig. 4(a) shows that, with 30% CH4 over the LSCF-GDC anode, the rate of CO2 formation starts to have 
relatively small but regular oscillation after about 75 min of operation. A comparison with that of 10% CH4 
shows an effect of the methane concentration on the occurrence of the oscillation of the CO2 rate – that is, 
higher methane concentration has higher possibility to induce the oscillation of the CO2 rate. A comparison of 
Fig. 4(b) with Fig. 3(b) shows that, over the Ni-LSCF-GDC anode, the oscillation of the formation rate of 
CO2 starts earlier as the methane concentration becomes larger. Additionally, the oscillation of the formation 
rate of CO2 is regular but that of CO is irregular. 
As the CH4 concentration increases to 50% over the LSCF-GDC anode, Fig. 5(a) shows that the 
oscillation of the CO2 rate becomes stronger, i.e. with larger amplitude, and also starts earlier, both in 
comparison with that of 30% CH4 as shown in Fig. 4(a). Thus, higher methane concentration induces stronger 
oscillation of the CO2 rate. This is also the case over the Ni-LSCF-GDC anode, as shown by comparing Figs. 
4(b) and 5(b). Additionally, higher CH4 concentration also results in larger amplitude of the oscillation of the 
CO rate. However, the amplitude of the oscillation has a limit and thus, with 50% CH4 as the fuel, the 
increased extent of the oscillation of the CO2 rate over Ni-LSCF-GDC is smaller than that over LSCF-GDC 
since the former is stronger than the latter with 30% CH4. This is confirmed by Fig. 6, which shows that the 
amplitude of the oscillation of the CO2 rate does not increase any more as the CH4 concentration increases to 
70%. This limit on the amplitude of the oscillation is associated with that on the extent of the build-up of the 
concentration of the oxygen vacancies in the anode bulk before the oscillation starts. 
Fig. 6(a) shows that, with 70% CH4 over the LSCF-GDC anode, the rate of CO2 formation has a large 
 58
(5) The oscillation of the formation rate of CO2 is regular but that of CO is irregular. 
(6) As the methane concentration increases, the current density increases. The current density with the 
Ni-added LSCF-GDC anode is always larger than that with the LSCF-GDC anode. 
(7) Higher methane concentration leads to higher possibility to induce the oscillations of both the electrical 
current and the CO2 formation rate and also to start them earlier. It can also result in a larger amplitude of 
the oscillation. 
(8) The addition of Ni onto LSCF-GDC reduces the possibility for the occurrence of the oscillation of the 
electricl current but promotes that of the rate of CO2 formation.

Effect of methane concentration on reaction behavior in direct-methane solid oxide fuel 
cells with (Ce,Gd)O2-x-impregnated FeCr layer for fuel processing 
 
Ta-Jen Huang*, Meng-Chin Huang 
 
Abstract 
A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia anode of 1 cm2 area was set up with a 
porous disk of gadolinia-doped ceria-impregnated FeCr as a gas diffusion layer (GDL) under direct-methane 
feeding. In this setup of SOFC plus GDL, the tests at 800oC and ambient pressure show that the current 
density, the methane conversion rate, the product formation rates, and the CO2 selectivity increased with 
increasing methane concentration. The major reaction in the GDL is CO2 reforming of methane to produce the 
syngas (CO plus H2). The anodic electrochemical oxidation of CO from GDL results in an overall rate of CO2 
formation being much larger than that of CO formation. There is a synergy between the rate of reaction in the 
GDL and that over the anode.

1. Introduction 
Methane is an attractive fuel for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). A great deal of research efforts have 
been put on the conversion of methane fuel into hydrogen-rich gas as required for the electrochemical reaction 
on the anode. Recently, SOFCs with internal reforming, either direct or indirect internal reforming [1-3], have 
attracted much attention since the requirement for a separate fuel reformer can thus be eliminated and the 
efficiency is increased by effective utilization of waste heat. Depending on the operating conditions, the heat 
consumed by internal reforming can vary from 40 to 70% of the total heat produced in a fuel cell [1]. 
Therefore, internal reforming SOFC is an energy efficient system design. However, over the usual Ni anode, 
coking is a well-known problem when methane is used as the fuel. Although the coking problem may be 
overcome by adding enough steam into the fuel stream, fuel dilution becomes a problem [1], in addition to the 
extra heating energy required to produce the steam. Direct-methane SOFCs (DM-SOFCs) with either an inert 
porous layer [4] or a catalyst layer [5] placed between the anode and the fuel stream is promising to solve the 
coking problem. 
Methane decomposition occurs over the Ni anode in DM-SOFCs [6,7]. At high temperatures, methane 
may decompose to produce the C species, the reaction being CH4 → C + 2 H2, similar to thermal cracking of 
methane. The deposited C species over Ni may cause coking [8], which can cause very rapid deactivation of 
the SOFC anode; consequently, the removal of the deposited carbon should be important. However, a carbon 
SOFC has been proposed to utilize the deposited carbon as a fuel [9]. Huang and Huang [10] have confirmed 
that the deposited carbon can be fully utilized for the generation of the electrical current. 
FeCr alloy can be used as the interconnect materials for intermediate temperature SOFCs [11]. Thus, 
FeCr can be utilized as the current collector over the SOFC anode. A porous FeCr disk has been used as the 
gas diffusion layer (GDL) and also as the current collector over the anode side of a DM-SOFC to achieve a 
 68
The method of the coating of the Ni-YSZ paste to make the anode layer has been described elsewhere 
[10]. The thus-prepared unit cell has an anode area of 1 cm2, an anode thickness of about 30 µm, an 
electrolyte thickness of 156 µm, a cathode area of 1 cm2 and a cathode thickness of about 5 µm. These 
thicknesses were measured from a scanning electron micrograph plot of the cross section of the unit cell. 
Completed unit cell were closely connected with the GDC-impregnated FeCr disk on the anode side and 
Pt mesh on the cathode side, and then with Pt wires to the current and voltage measurement unit. The ceramic 
paste was used to seal the unit cell in a quartz tube with a heat treatment of 400oC for 1.5 h so as to complete 
the preparation of the test unit with a single cell. The anode side of the unit cell is sealed in the quartz tube and 
the cathode side is exposed to stagnant air. 
A sketch of the set-up, identifying the different layers of the SOFC unit and their dimensions and 
showing how the SOFC unit cell is embedded in the quartz tube, has been reported elsewhere [20]. For the 
measurement of the temperature of the unit cell, the thermocouple was placed on the anode side and touched 
the FeCr disk. 
 
2.3. Activity tests of unit cell 
A voltage of 0.61V was maintained for all tests in this work. The test temperature was fixed at 800oC. 
The tests were conducted at ambient pressure. For reduction, the feed to the anode side was 10% H2 in argon. 
For the direct methane test, the fuel to the anode side was 10.5-70 % methane (99.9% purity) in argon. The 
flow rate was always 100 ml/min passing the anode side. 
All tests started with the reduction of the anode at 400oC in 10% H2 for 1 h. Then, pure argon flow was 
passed for 2 h to purge the system. The test unit was then heated in argon to 800oC at a rate of 5oC/min. Then, 
the direct methane test was carried out with introducing methane fuel flow for 360 min. Then, the anode-side 
flow was switched to argon; the argon flow was kept until the measured electrical current became zero. 
During the testing, electrical current, voltage, and outlet gas compositions were continuously measured. 
The concentrations of CO and CO2 were measured by CO-NDIR and CO2-NDIR (non-dispersive infrared 
analyzer, Beckman 880), respectively. Other gas compositions were measured by two gas chromatographs 
(China Chromatography 8900) in series. 
The gas chromatographs (GCs) were equipped with molecular sieve 5A column (GC1) and Porapak Q 
column (GC2), respectively. GC1 was used to measure the concentration of water in the product stream; a 
molecular sieve 5A column was placed in between GC1 and GC2 to remove possible content of water; GC2 
was used to measure the concentrations of hydrogen and methane. Thermal conductivity detector was used for 
both GCs. The GC carrier gas was argon with 99.9995% purity. GC measurements were carried out every 10 
min with auto sampling. GC calibrations were carried out or checked before each test. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Variation of current density with methane concentration 
Fig. 1 shows the variation of the profiles of the current density with the methane concentration. The 
current density increases as the methane concentration increases from 30-70% CH4, as also shown in Table 1. 
A steady-state or stable current density can be obtained; this indicates that the amount of the deposited C 
species over the anode was small and thus possible coking was not serious to result in a deactivation of the 
performance of the direct-methane SOFCs. This is attributed to the existence of the FeCr GDL, which 
 70
indicates the oxidation of the deposited C species, a period of de-coking. Therefore, the initial increase of the 
rates can be attributed to the deposition of the C species and the followed going down of the rates be 
attributed to the oxidation of these deposited C species. Notably, the deposited carbon cannot be removed by 
electrochemical oxidation quickly enough; this is attributed to the fact that some deposited carbon is formed 
on the top-most surface of the anode [6], whereas electrochemical oxidation proceeds at the triple phase 
boundary and its rate is larger the closer to the bottom of the anode. This is shown in Fig. 2 that the amount of 
initially deposited carbon is much larger than that of removed carbon at the latter stage of methane flow. This 
is also attributed to simultaneous occurrence of carbon deposition and de-coking during the latter stage of 
methane flow. Therefore, some of the deposited carbon remains and can be electrochemically oxidized to 
generate an electrical current during argon flow, as shown in Fig. 1. 
Fig. 2 also shows that the initial going up and down of the methane conversion rate and the COx 
formation rate is in accordance with the initial behavior of the H2 formation rate. During the deposition of the 
C species, H2 is formed according to 
CH4 → C + 2H2                                                (2) 
and thus the H2 formation rate goes up in association with methane conversion. Then, during the oxidation of 
the deposited C species, there is no H2 formation and thus the H2 formation rate goes down. 
After the oxidation of some of the initially deposited C species to free some of the active sites, the 
methane conversion rate can equal the COx formation rate, as shown in Fig. 2 after about 100 min of SOFC 
operation. In this case, the rate of H2 formation (∆H2) is about two times that of methane conversion (∆CH4); 
Table 1 shows that ∆H2 is two times ∆CH4. This is in accordance with the occurrence of the reactions of 
CH4 + O → CO + 2H2                                           (3) 
and/or 
CH4 + 2O → CO2 + 2H2                                         (4) 
in the GDL, where O is the lattice oxygen species, or with the occurrence of the reactions of 
CH4 + O2- → CO + 2H2 + 2e-                                     (5) 
and/or 
CH4 + 2O2- → CO2 + 2H2 + 4e-                                   (6) 
over the anode, where O2- is the oxygen-ion species coming from the cathode. Since the formation of H2O 
would decrease the rate of H2 formation, ∆H2 being two times ∆CH4 agrees with the observation of no H2O 
formation. Notably, also, there is a period between 200-300 min of SOFC operation when the oxidation of the 
deposited C species occurs to form CO and/or CO2 and the rate of H2 formation goes down; this is associated 
with a decrease of the methane conversion rate, as also shown by ∆CH4 < ∆(CO+CO2) in Table 1. 
Fig. 3 shows the product formation rates and CH4 conversion rate with 50% CH4 as the fuel. These rates 
also go up and down initially as with 30% CH4. Initially, the rate of methane conversion is also larger than 
that of COx formation, indicating the deposition of the C species. However, this period of C deposition with 
50% CH4 is longer than that with 30% CH4. This longer period of C deposition is attributed to higher CH4 
concentration. 
Fig. 4 shows the product formation rates and the CH4 conversion rate with 70% CH4 as the fuel. There 
is also an initial period of C deposition and this period is again longer than that with 50% CH4. However, the 
rates do not go up and down initially as those with 30 and 50% CH4 as the fuel, but increase continuously 
until reaching a steady state. This is attributed to that higher methane concentration leads to larger rate of 
 72
CH4 + CO2 → 2CO + 2H2                                      (12) 
which is the reaction of CO2 reforming of methane [31]. This reaction is the major reaction in the GDL, as 
will be clarified in the following. 
The initial drop of the rate of CO2 formation is attributed to the concentration of the surface lattice 
oxygen over GDC being exhausted. Notably, the decrease of the concentration of surface lattice oxygen over 
GDC is due to that the rate of consumption of the O species for COx formation is higher than that of 
replenishment of the O species via reaction (10). However, this occurs only initially; then, the rates can come 
to a balance. As shown in Fig. 5, the rate of CO formation reaches a maximum when that of CO2 formation 
reaches a minimum; both the maximum and the minimum occur at the same time, about 40 min of SOFC 
operation, when the initial period of carbon deposition shifts to that of de-coking, as shown by comparing Figs. 
2 and 5. Then, the rate of CO2 formation increases while that of CO formation decreases, leading to larger rate 
of CO2 formation than that of CO formation. 
Since reaction (12) produces two CO, which may lead to the formation of two CO2 over the anode, but 
the replenishment of the lattice oxygen in the GDL via reaction (10) needs only one CO2, there can be a net 
rate of the formation of one more CO2 in the setup of SOFC plus GDL. This agrees with the observation that 
the overall rate of the formation of CO2 is much higher than that of CO, as shown in Table 1. However, in an 
SOFC without GDL, more CO than CO2 is produced [12]. Thus, CO2 reforming of methane to produce the 
syngas should be the major reaction in the GDL and the GDL of this work should have such a fuel processing 
capability as to result in the major part of methane conversion occurring in the GDL than over the anode. It is 
also possible that, over the anode, CO from the GDL competes with that of methane for the active sites so as 
to reduce the methane conversion. 
In the GDL, increasing methane concentration results in an increase of the amount of the deposited C 
species and thus increases the amount of CO formed. This leads to higher amount of CO2 formed over the 
anode and thus the CO2 selectivity can increase with increasing methane concentration. This is indeed the case 
as shown in Table 1 and in accordance with the above proposal that the fuel processing capability of the GDL 
in this work can result in major part of methane conversion occurring in the GDL than over the anode. 
The above results indicate that there is a synergy between the rates of reactions in the GDL and over the 
anode. In the setup of SOFC plus GDL, the major reaction process is: 
(1) In the GDL, the incoming methane encounters CO2 coming from the anode to perform CO2 reforming of 
methane. This produces CO in the GDL. 
(2) The transport of the produced CO and the remaining methane to the anode to produce CO2 and CO. 
Therefore, an increased rate of CO formation in the GDL can lead to an increased rate of CO2 formation over 
the anode, which then increases the rate of CO2 reforming of methane in the GDL. Notably, H2 is transported 
to and also produced over the anode. However, as discussed in the above, H2 cannot compete with either 
methane or CO to be adsorbed over the anode and thus the amount of possible H2O formation is zero or too 
small to be detectable. 
Fig. 6 shows similar CO and CO2 behaviors as those of Fig. 5. This confirms the above described 
reactions in the GDL and over the anode. However, the region where the rate of CO formation is larger than 
that of CO2 formation becomes smaller with this increase of the CH4 concentration from 30 to 50 %. This is 
attributed to that the concentration of the C species increases with increasing CH4 concentration and thus the 
net rate of CO2 formation increases according to the above discussion, which is based on CO2 reforming of

Commercial anode-supported SOFCs usually use Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the anode 
material. The thickness of the Ni-YSZ anode is usually around 800 µm. However, the anode functional layer 
is usually considered to have a thickness less than 100 µm; Kong et al. [8] have shown that, with Ni-YSZ 
anode for anode-supported SOFCs, the thickness of the effective electrochemical reaction zone of the anode is 
about 40-50 µm. Thus, most portion of the Ni-YSZ anode in the anode-supported SOFCs should work only as 
a catalytic layer. Notably, the anode functional layer is the portion of the anode where the oxygen ions can 
reach so to result in electrochemical oxidation, noting that the needed oxygen ions are migrated from the 
cathode to the anode via the electrolyte. Thus, the Ni-YSZ catalytic layer can be simulated by a separate 
Ni-YSZ catalyst layer. 
In this work, propane was fed to an anode-supported SOFC unit cell with Ni-YSZ anode. A catalytic 
reactor with a layer of Ni-YSZ catalyst was used to simulate the reactions occurring in the Ni-YSZ catalytic 
layer of SOFC. CO2 reforming of propane was carried out over Ni-YSZ catalyst and it has been shown that 
the actual reaction type during internal fuel processing of propane in the Ni-YSZ catalytic layer of SOFC 
should be CO2 reforming of propane. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Preparation of NiO-YSZ powder 
The YSZ powder was prepared by the method of solid state reaction. Yttria powder was mixed with 
zirconia powder in a ratio of Y/Zr = 8 mole%. The mixture was ball milled to carry out solid state reaction. 
Then, the mixture was heated to 1600 oC and held for 4 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the YSZ 
powder was obtained. The composition of YSZ is Zr0.92Y0.08O2. 
The NiO-YSZ powder was also prepared by the method of solid state reaction. The nickel oxide powder 
was mixed with the YSZ powder in a ratio of NiO:YSZ = 1:2 in weight. The mixture was ball milled to carry 
out solid state reaction. Then, the mixture was heated to 1400 oC and held for 4 h to obtain the NiO-YSZ 
powder. 
 
2.2. Construction of SOFC unit cell 
A disk of anode support was made of the NiO-YSZ powder by compress. Certain amount of NiO-YSZ 
powder was mixed with 15 wt% polyvinyl butyral and 1 wt% graphite. After mixing uniformly, the powder 
was put in a compress with 20 ton pressure for 20 sec. Then, the disk was taken out of the compress, heated to 
1400 oC and held for 4 h to obtain the NiO-YSZ disk. 
One side of the disk was spin-coated with YSZ paste as the electrolyte layer. The coating was done with 
2000rpm for 40 sec. After 10 coatings, the coated disk was heated to 1400 oC and held for 8 h. Then, the 
cathode layer was prepared by screen printing with La0.8Sr0.2MnO3. The printed disk was heated to 1150
 oC 
and held for 3 h to obtain the anode-supported SOFC unit cell. The cell area is 2 cm2. 
 
2.3. Fixed-voltage test in SOFC 
The fixed-voltage test was performed at 800 oC with the operating voltage kept constant at 0.6 V. 
Before the test, 30% H2 in argon was passed over the anode to reduce NiO to Ni. Then, the anode side was 
purged with argon. The test started with passing 100 ml min-1 of 5% C3H8 in argon. The cathode gas was 100 
ml min-1 of 20% O2 in argon. 
 82
However, since the formation rate of C2H6 is very much smaller than that of C2H4, reaction (5) should have 
occurred at a much smaller rate than that of reaction (4). Additionally, since the formation rate of CH4 is 
larger than that of C2H4, other reaction for the formation of CH4 should have occurred, such as 
dehydrogenation of propane to form methane: 
     C3H8 → CH4 + 2C + 2H2                                        (6) 
which can result in relatively large rate of the formation of deposited carbon. 
The deposited carbon has been detected, as shown in Fig. 2, which shows the variation of carbon 
deposit with distance from the electrolyte layer after 300 min test. The relative amount of carbon deposit 
decreases with decreasing distance from the electrolyte layer. At about 80 µm from the electrolyte layer, there 
is almost no carbon deposit. Notably, the portion of the anode layer with a distance from the electrolyte layer 
of about 80 µm to 800 µm, the latter being the thickness of the anode layer, may be considered as the anode 
catalytic layer; that of the anode layer with a distance from the electrolyte layer less than about 80 µm may be 
considered as the anode functional layer. Thus, the reforming of propane and the removal of deposited carbon 
should have occurred in the anode catalytic layer via some gas products from electrochemical oxidation over 
the anode functional layer. The major reactions over the anode functional layer are those of the formed CH4, 
C2H4 and H2 from reactions (4) and (6). Reactions of CH4 and C2H4 usually start via dissociation: 
CH4 → C + 2H2                                               (7) 
C2H4 → 2C + 2H2                                              (8) 
followed by oxidation of the formed C species: 
C + O → CO                                                  (9) 
C + 2O → CO2                                               (10) 
where the O species is the surface lattice oxygen. The O species can be supplemented by migration from the 
cathode via the electrolyte; this process results in the generation of an electrical current. The stable generation 
of the current density indicates that there is no deactivation of the anode functional layer by the formed C 
species; thus, these C species should have been completely removed from the anode functional layer, in 
agreement with the observation shown in Fig. 2. Notably, also, the rates of CO and CO2 formations depend on 
the mobility and the concentration of the bulk lattice oxygen [9]. Additionally, oxidation of H2 forms H2O: 
H2 + O → H2O                                               (11) 
Notably, also, H2O has been formed in a relatively large amount initially, up to about 40 min on stream; this 
results in a decrease of the formed H2 in the gas product to a minimum, as shown in Fig. 1. Then, the formed 
H2O becomes increasingly smaller, in accordance with the gradual increase of the H2 formation rate. This is 
attributed to the fact that an increasingly larger amount of the C species is adsorbed over the active sites so 
that H2 can no longer be adsorbed to form H2O [10]. 
When propane reacts with CO2 and H2O as formed in the anode functional layer, respectively, CO2 and 
steam reforming of propane take place in the anode catalytic layer. The formed CO can be transported to the 
anode functional layer to be oxidized: 
CO + O → CO2                                               (12) 
This adds more CO2 for propane reforming. Notably, the formed CO2 can also gasify and thus remove the 
deposited carbon [11,12]: 
C + CO2 → 2CO                                              (13) 
This may explain why the amount of deposited carbon becomes smaller at a distance closer to the electrolyte 
 84
to an increased extent of reaction (6). This also results in an increase of CH4 formation rate with time, as 
indeed observed. The increase of CO formation rate with time as also observed in Fig. 3 to 5 is in accordance 
with a decrease of the CO2 content—that is, an increase of CO2 consumption rate; this is very possibly 
associated with the occurrence of reaction (15). Therefore, CO2 reforming of propane may be mostly the 
oxidation of the C species from dehydrogenation and dissociation of propane and its fragments by the O 
species from CO2 dissociation. However, further studies are needed to clarify the reaction mechanism for CO2 
reforming of propane. Nevertheless, CO2 dissociation to produce the O species for oxidation should be a 
major reaction during CO2 reforming of propane. 
Since CO and H2 are the major components in the gas product either during direct propane SOFC 
operation or during CO2 reforming of propane over Ni-YSZ catalyst, the CO/H2 ratio is used for a comparison 
of the product formation behavior between SOFC and catalytic operations. Fig. 6A and B shows that the 
profiles of CO/H2 ratios over the catalyst are very similar to that in the SOFC during the latter period. 
Especially, the profile of CO/H2 ratio with 6.30% CO2 over the catalyst has best similarity to that in the SOFC. 
Notably, the initial going up of the CO/H2 ratio in the SOFC up to about 40 min on stream is due to H2 
oxidation to form H2O. The generally decreasing CO/H2 ratio is due to increasingly larger formation rate of 
H2 than that of CO. This may be due to increasingly larger extent of propane dehydrogenation than that of 
reforming. However, this is a rather complex process and thus needs further studies for clarification. 
Table 1 presents the steady-state CO/H2 ratios for catalytic propane reforming and SOFC operations 
with 5% propane. The steady-state CO/H2 ratio of propane reforming with 6.30% CO2 is the same as that of 
direct propane SOFC. This indicates that reforming of 5% propane with 6.30% CO2 can simulte internal 
reforming of direct propane SOFC with feeding of 5% propane, in agreement with the above observation. 
Table 2 shows the steady-state product rates during CO2 reforming of propane with 6.30% CO2 and direct 
propane SOFC. The C2H4/CH4 ratios of catalytic CO2 reforming and SOFC operation are about the same; the 
CH4/CO ratios are also about the same while the C2H4/CO ratios are almost the same. Notably, CH4 and C2H4 
are the major hydrocarbon fragments from propane decomposition and dehydrogenation while CO is the 
major product from CO2 reforming. Therefore, the reactions for propane reforming with 6.30% CO2 should be 
about the same as those for direct propane SOFC. This confirms that steady-state reforming in direct propane 
SOFC is CO2 reforming of propane. 
The above results show that fuel processing in direct propane SOFC with 5% C3H8 can be simulated 
with CO2 reforming of propane with 6.30% CO2—that is, CO2/C3H8 molar ratio is 1.26, which is much 
smaller than 3 for the stoichiometric reaction of CO2 reforming of propane. This shortage of CO2 is partially 
due to that electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbon over the anode produces more CO than CO2, in 
accordance with the observation that hydrocarbon processing in SOFC produces syngas, i.e. mixture of CO 
and H2 [14,15]. Thus, other propane reactions occur in large extent. The major gas effluents of SOFC and 
catalytic reactor are the same, i.e. H2, CO, CH4, C2H4 and CO2. The effluent of some CO2 from SOFC 
indicates that CO2 reforming of propane should have occurred. 
 
4. Conclusions 
(1) The SOFC performance is stable, in terms of the generated current density, with direct propane feeding. 
(2) The C specie formed over the anode functional layer of SOFC can be completely removed. 
(3) The major gas products of fuel processing in direct propane SOFC are H2, CO, CH4, C2H4 and CO2.

Roles of surface and bulk lattice oxygen in forming CO2 and CO during methane reaction over 
gadolinia-doped ceria 
 
Ta-Jen Huang *, Chun-Hsiu Wang 
 
Abstract 
Gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) has been frequently used as the ceramic component in the anode cermet 
materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating on methane. For methane reactions over high 
temperature SOFC anodes, especially in the direct-methane SOFCs, carbon deposition (coking) is usually a 
problem and can cause cell failure; however, the coking problem can be avoided if GDC is used as the anode 
materials without metal. In these methane reactions, the lattice oxygen of GDC has exhibited important roles. 
In this work, temperature-programmed reaction of methane and temperature-programmed reduction were 
performed over gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC). A mechanism of CO and CO2 formations via CH4 reaction over 
GDC, a mixed ionic-electronic conductor, was derived for the case without gas-phase oxygen, a situation 
related to direct methane solid oxide fuel cell. It was found that CO2 formation can occur at very much lower 
temperature than CO formation. The surface lattice oxygen acts as the active site for CH4 adsorption. This 
active site has a dynamic characteristic due to the mobility of the lattice oxygen. The rates of CO and CO2 
formations can be controlled by the supply rate of the lattice oxygen from the GDC bulk; this supply rate 
depends on the mobility and the concentration of the bulk lattice oxygen. CO2 formation is associated with the 
surface lattice oxygen while CO formation depends on the O species coming from the bulk lattice. The 
difference between CO2 and CO formations is only the involvement of the OH species and the O species, 
respectively, in the final step in their formation mechanism.

Abstract: 
A novel catalyst of mixed oxides of Bi2O3 and gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) was prepared and characterized 
by temperature-programmed reduction using hydrogen (H2-TPR), X-ray diffraction, CO-TPR, 
temperature-programmed reaction of methane (CH4-TPRx) and fixed-temperature reaction of direct methane 
oxidation, i.e. methane reaction with lattice oxygen of the catalyst in the absence of gas-phase oxygen. It is 
concluded that Bi2O3 addition into GDC enhances both hydrogen reactivity and CO reactivity of the catalyst 
during temperature-programmed reduction. This is due to the segregation of Bi2O3 to the surface and the high 
content of mobile oxygen in Bi2O3. CO interaction with the surface lattice oxygen is enhanced to a higher 
extent than H2 interaction, and this enhanced extent has a maximum in Bi2O3 concentration. This maximum 
exists also for activities of direct methane oxidation during CH4-TPRx and fixed-temperature reaction of 
methane. A synergistic effect is shown for the Bi2O3-GDC mixed oxides to combine the high methane 
adsorption ability of GDC with the high content of mobile oxygen of Bi2O3. By modulating the Bi2O3 
concentration, CO2 selectivity of direct methane oxidation can be varied. Bi2O3 in GDC also enhances the self 
de-coking capability of the catalyst so as to achieve a stable activity for direct methane oxidation over the 
Bi2O3-GDC mixed oxides.

Effect of operating conditions on electrochemical behavior of hydrogen fed solid oxide fuel cells 
Ta-Jen Huang *, Meng-Chin Huang 
 
     The performance of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with Ni-yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) anode has 
been extensively investigated with hydrogen as fuel [1,2]. It is well-known that the operating conditions, such 
as the gas-phase composition, have strong influence on the electrochemical behavior of the SOFC anode, such 
as hydrogen oxidation kinetics [2]. The electrochemical behaviors include some kinetic phenomena such as 
hydrogen spillover, oxygen spillover, and interstitial hydrogen transfer. However, the measurements for the 
electrochemical behavior are usually those of impedance spectra [3]. The impedance measurements are 
carried out at open circuit, i.e. under electrochemical equilibrium, and thus may not lead to a proper 
interpretation for a kinetic behavior. Therefore, Jiang and Ramprakash [1] pointed out that there is no common 
consensus in the mechanism and kinetics of H2 oxidation reaction. For the SOFC design to achieve an 
optimum performance, the understanding of the electrochemical behavior of hydrogen oxidation over the 
Ni-YSZ anode at close circuit, i.e. with electricity generation, is important. Thus, it is desirable to study the 
effects of the operating conditions on the SOFC behavior when the operations are performed at close circuit. 
     In this work, a SOFC test unit was constructed with YSZ electrolyte, Ni-YSZ anode and Pt cathode. 
SOFC operations were performed at close circuit with variation of hydrogen supply time, voltage, and 
temperature at 700~900oC. The phenomena of electrochemical promotion of bulk lattice-oxygen extraction 
[4-6] and fuel-free current [7] were observed. The amount of lattice oxygen additionally extracted by 
electrochemical promotion is limited. This limitation has a higher value at a higher temperature. The 
interstitial hydrogen species are formed as either the interstitial hydrogen atoms in bulk Ni or the interstitial 
protons in bulk YSZ. The amount of the interstitial hydrogen species is also limited. Oxygen transport in YSZ 
to the YSZ-Ni interface is rate limiting for H2O formation over the anode. These new characteristics on the 
electrochemical behavior can help the design of the operating conditions for hydrogen-fed SOFCs. 
     The phenomenon of electrochemical promotion of bulk lattice-oxygen extraction [4-6] has been 
observed in a hydrogen-fed SOFC. There is a limitation on the amount of lattice oxygen additionally extracted 
from the anode-side bulk by this electrochemical promotion effect. This limitation has a higher value at a 
higher temperature. As the operating voltage increases, the process of the electrochemically-promoted 
extraction of bulk lattice oxygen lasts longer but the amount of additionally-extracted lattice oxygen becomes 
smaller. The phenomenon of the generation of electrical current without the fuel, termed the fuel-free current 
[7], has also been observed. The occurrence of the fuel-free current is attributed to the deficiency of the bulk 
lattice-oxygen concentration on the anode side by the before-hand fuel oxidation. The interstitial hydrogen 
species should have been formed as either the interstitial hydrogen atoms in bulk Ni or the interstitial protons 
in bulk YSZ. There is a limitation on the amount of the interstitial hydrogen species. Oxygen transport in YSZ 
to the YSZ-Ni interface is rate limiting for H2O formation over the anode. A large and effective three-phase 
boundary (TPB) over the anode for H2O formation is important to have a good electrochemical behavior for a 
hydrogen-fed SOFC.

Electrochemical CO2 reduction with power generation in solid oxide fuel cells 
Ta-Jen Huang* and Chien-Liang Chou 
Department of Chemical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University 
Hsinchu, Taiwan 
Abstract 
A novel process of electrochemical CO2 reduction with power generation in solid oxide fuel cells 
(SOFCs) is proposed. CO2 is used as the oxidant to the cathode of SOFCs. The reduction of CO2 at the SOFC 
cathode produces CO: 
CO2 → CO + O 
The O species supplies the required oxidant for the cathode to generate power in SOFCs (Fig. 1).

The produced CO (Fig. 2) can be utilized as the chemical raw material or as the fuel. The initial results of this 
work can confirm the feasibility of this proposed process. With improvement of this process and integration to 
SOFC stacks, the greenhouse gas CO2 can be efficiently utilized as the raw material (reactant) to produce CO. 
This process of CO production from CO2 does not need other reactant, such as methane in the dry reforming 
process.

Simultaneous NO reduction and electricity generation in SOFCs with V2O5 or Cu added 
LSCF-GDC cathodes

Abstract 
The removal of nitric oxide (NO) from industrial flue gas in stationary sources is traditionally 
performed by the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process, in which NO in the flue gas reacts with 
ammonia to produce nitrogen and water. This SCR process has to use a reducing gas, usually ammonia, while 
residual ammonia needs additional treatment. Thus, the electrochemical NO reduction without a reducing gas 
has been studied extensively. However, this process of electrochemical NO reduction is performed with 
applied current and the current efficiency is generally only a few percent; additionally, simultaneous O2 
reduction occurs to consume substantial amount of the electrical current. Therefore, simultaneous NO 
reduction and electricity generation in a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) should be an attractive process; the 
feasibility of such a process has been confirmed in SOFCs with either V2O5 or Cu added 
La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (LSCF)-Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (GDC) cathodes [T.J. Huang, C.L. Chou, Electrochem. Comm. 
11 (2009) 477]. 
In this work, SOFC units have been constructed with Ni-GDC as the anode, YSZ (yttria-stabilized 
zirconia) as the electrolyte, and V2O5 or Cu added LSCF-GDC composites as the cathode. The SOFC 
operation is performed at 800-890 oC under a fixed voltage and with a simulated flue gas passing the cathode 
side; that is, the O2 concentration is 4~6 %; however, lower O2 concentrations have also been studied. The 
electrochemical NO reduction occurs over either V2O5 or Cu added LSCF-GDC cathode. When the O2 
concentration is 3% or larger, simultaneous NO reduction and electricity generation in the SOFCs can be 
beneficial via a synergistic effect. As the SOFC temperature increases, the NO conversion increases. However, 
the voltage has only a minor effect on the NO conversion.
