provided here (see Fig. 2). For more details, see [9]. The 
ABE system is comprised of two basic components: a 
photovoltaic unit (PV unit) and a thermoelectric heat 
pump unit (TE unit). The PV unit consists of 
photovoltaic cells, which are solid-state devices that 
convert solar radiation energy into electrical energy. 
The TE unit consists of thermoelectric heaters/coolers 
(referred to here onwards as TE coolers), which are 
solid-state devices that convert electrical energy into 
thermal energy, or the reverse. The PV and the TE units 
are integrated within the overall ABE enclosure. As 
shown in Fig. 2, the PV unit forms an envelope 
surrounding the external wall such that a gap is 
maintained between the wall and the PV unit. This gap 
acts as an external heat dissipation zone for the TE unit. 
The external walls of the proposed ABE system consist 
of two layers, as shown in Fig. 2. The external layer 
(facing the PV unit) is made of a thermal insulating 
material, and the internal layer is made of a material 
with high heat storage capacity. In Fig. 2, the words 
‘‘Thermal insulation’’ and ‘‘Thermal Mass’’ pertain to 
the external and the internal layers of the ABE wall, 
respectively. The TE coolers/heaters are dispersed 
inside the openings that are provided in the insulating 
layer. Each TE cooler/heater consists of two heat sinks. 
As shown in Fig. 2, the internal heat sink either absorbs 
or dissipates heat to the thermal mass layer. The 
external heat sink either absorbs heat from, or dissipates 
heat to, the surrounding air; through natural or forced 
convection. 
The author’s team; Tsai BJ [10] just finished a project; 
In a building installed the ABE system without SSPCM, 
wind、solar driven, bypass the windmill flow as a air 
flow (as shown Fig. 3), ambient temperature, To is equal 
to 308 K and indoor temperature, Ti is 301 K. 
Numerical results show the Ti will decrease 2 K when 
the ABE operating with heat sinks, without fan. As fan 
is opened, strong convective heat transfer, Ti will 
decrease approximately 4~5 K. 
3. Hybrid system: 
Zhou et al. [11] in 2009 reported effect of 
shape-stabilized phase change material (SSPCM) plates 
in a building (as shown Fig. 4) combined with night 
ventilation in summer is investigated numerically. Their 
conclusions show that the SSPCM plates could decrease 
the daily maximum temperature by up to 2 K due to the 
cool storage at night. Under the present conditions, the 
appropriate values for melting temperature, heat of 
fusion, thermal conductivity and thickness of SSPCM 
plates are 26 C, 160 kJ kg-1, 0.5Wm-1 C-1 and 20 mm, 
respectively. The ACH at night needs to be as high as 
possible but the ACH at daytime should be controlled. 
4. Literature survey of numerical techniques :  
During the phase change the solid–liquid interface 
moves away from the heat transfer surface. The 
difficulty in solving a phase change problem is the 
presence of a moving boundary or region on which heat 
and mass balance conditions have to be met. Generally, 
two approaches of the finite difference and finite 
element techniques are used to solve the phase change 
problems numerically. One of the methods to solve the 
moving boundary problem is enthalpy formulation [12, 
13]. The enthalpy method is used in a particular way so 
that the only unknown variable is the temperature of the 
phase change material and the solidification occurs at a 
uniform temperature. In this work we use the modified 
enthalpy method treats the enthalpy as a temperature 
dependent variable and constructs the latent heat flow 
through the volume integration with the use of the 
enthalpy of the system [14, 15]. Heat transfer with 
moving boundary involving phase change is very 
important in latent heat storage application, i.e., ice 
formation, freezing of food, castings, metallurgy, crystal 
growth and various other solidification techniques. The 
predication of temperature distribution and rate of 
melting or solidification is very important in order to 
design such storage device. 
 
II. Analysis method—Physical and Mathematic 
analysis and modeling 
The analysis is designed to examine the indoor thermal 
comfort level under night ventilation when the SSPCM 
plates are used or not. A typical south-facing middle 
room (room A shown in Fig. 5) in a multi-layer building 
in Hsinchu city, Taiwan, is considered as the model 
room for analysis, which has only one exterior wall (the 
south wall) and others are all interior envelopes. The 
dimension of the room is assumed as 3.9 m (length) x 
3.3 m (width) x 2.7 m (height). The south wall is 
externally insulated with 60-mm-thick expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) board. There are a 2.1 m x 1.5 m 
double-glazed window and 1.5 m x 1.5 m ABE system 
in the south wall and a 0.9 m x 2 m wood door in the 
north wall which is adjacent to another room or the 
corridor. The overall heat transfer coefficients of the 
window and door are 3.01 and 0.875Wm-2 C-1, 
respectively. SSPCM plates are attached to inner 
surfaces of four walls and the ceiling as linings. Based 
on a practical consideration, no SSPCM is included in 
the floor structure. Thermo-physical properties of 
SSPCM and materials of building envelopes are shown 
in Table 1. The phase transition temperature range of 
SSPCM is assumed to be 1 K. Natural ventilation in the 
day and mechanical ventilation at night are considered. 
The total indoor heat produced by the equipments, 
furniture, light and occupants, etc. is assumed to be 
50W (average value over the day). The summer climate 
data is generated by the software Medpha [8]. A verified 
enthalpy model [16] is applied for this simulation.

III. Numerical technique 
 
1. Description of the model room 
The model room for analysis, which has dimension 
assumed as 3.9 m (length) x 3.3 m (width) x 2.7 m 
(height) concrete chamber. The thickness of chamber is 
300mm, except the floor and the south wall each wall 
was installed 50mm thick SSPCM. The south wall is 
externally insulated with 60-mm-thick expanded 
polystyrene (EPS) board. There are a 2.1 m x 1.5 m 
double-glazed window and 1.5 m x 1.5 m ABE system 
in the south wall and a 0.9 m x 2 m wood door in the 
north wall which is adjacent to another room or the 
corridor. Floor is made of the first 30mm thick wood 
layer, under that the second layer is 40mm SSPCM 
layer, in between is the air layer with 30mm thick. And 
the extended computational domain is six times larger 
than that of the model room. ( see Fig. 9, Fig. 10) 
2. Input parameters of the model room and applying

5. Initial conditions 
The energy stored in cycle is: absorption heat 
The ambient temperature is 303 K, 1atm and 
temperature of SSPCM layer is assuming a constant 
temperature 293 K, the optimal time (ie. Melting/fusing 
temperature, and its latent capacity is 265MJ/m3。The 
initial condition (t=0) of indoor air temperature is 
assuming 303 K。 On the contrary, 
The energy release in cycle is: removal heat 
The ambient temperature is 289 K, 1atm and 
temperature of SSPCM layer is assuming a constant 
temperature 303 K, the optimal time (i.e. Melting/fusing 
temperature, and its latent capacity is 265MJ/m3。The 
initial condition (t=0) of indoor air temperature is 
assuming 289 K。 
Each time increment △t is 0.1 sec, then iterations up to 
the time we set, and need to satisfy the convergence 
criteria. 
6. Boundary conditions 
Using the embedding macro files of the Fluent to select 
our boundary conditions and our case is unsteady. And 
the maximum of solar radiation on the south wall is 
900Wm-2 and the Hsin-Chu city in summer wind speed 
is southern 6 ms-1 、average out door temperature is 
302.96 K in winter wind speed is southern 6.6 ms-1 、
average out door temperature is 288.9 K (see Table 2)。 
7. Convergence criteria 
For the purposes of solving any number of flow field 
changes in the iterative process, Simulation convergence 
criteria as shown in table 3. 
 
IV. Result and Discussion 
  
1. Simulated temperature results of active ABE 
Fig. 12 is the comparison of temperature distribution of 
active ABE for the fan was on (above) and off (below) 
in the summer. The gap is between solar panels and the 
TE wall as the hot side. The temperature can reach 313 
to 318 K. Another side of TE produced the cooling 
effect, and through air-conditioning spread cool air to 
indoor space. Take the temperature condition at Y = 
1.2m. The indoor temperature is 302 to 305 K with fan 
turning on, or the indoor temperature is about 304 to 
307 without turning on the fan. The results show the fan 
can speed up TE cooling cold-side to spread quickly to 
the entire room.  
 
2. Simulated PMV results of active ABE  
ISO 7730 has recommended the use of the comfort 
indicators PMV (Predicted Mean Vote):  
PMV provides for an average reference, to measure the 
comfortableness of human body in an environment. 
PMV index produced from many different testers, in the 
specific measurement environment, their subjective 
assessment for a number of environmental conditions. It 
is divided into seven stages, ranging from -3 (very cold) 
extends to +3 (extremely warm), neutral point of 0 for 
moderate heat conditions.  
Fig. 13 is the PMV value when turning on and off the 
fan, i.e., the smaller the value of PMV, the more

技術說明 
Effect of shape-stabilized phase change material (SSPCM) plates combined with 
night ventilation in summer is investigated numerically. A building in Hsinchu, 
Taiwan without active air-conditioning is considered for analysis, which includes 
SSPCM plates as inner linings of walls、 the ceiling and floor, and an active building 
envelope system (ABE) is installed as well in the room becomes the Hybrid system. 
Unsteady simulation is performed using a verified enthalpy model, with time period 
covering the summer season. In the present study, a kind of floor with SSPCM is put 
forward which can absorb the solar radiation energy in the daytime or in summer and 
release the heat at night or in winter. In the present paper, the thermal performance of 
a room using such floor、wall and ceiling were numerically studied. Results show 
that the average indoor air temperature of a room with the SSPCM floor was about 2 
K to 4 K higher than that of the room without SSPCM floor, and the indoor air 
temperature swing range was narrowed greatly. This manifests that applying SSPCM
in room suitably can increase the thermal comfort degree and save space heating 
energy in winter.

Photovoltaic (PV) systems and another for the 
Thermoelectric (TE) system. PV system changes the 
solar radiation energy into electrical energy. TE 
system’s component changes the electrical energy into 
heat energy, or the reverse to change the heat into 
electricity. Thermoelectric (TE) components are located 
in the various openings within the insulating layers, 
each TE component has two heat sinks – one for heat 
absorption, and another for heat dissipation. Regardless 
of the external heat sink for heat absorption or 
dissipation, both by natural convection or forced 
convection of heat transfer into the air. The above study 
was made by Dr. Steve Van Dessel’s research team of 
the United States and assessed the feasibility of ABE 
systems analysis model. From the total input voltage, 
we can be observed electricity generated by BiPV is 
higher than the total input power of TE units, so the 
ABE system is feasible. 
Therefore, this study is under the motivation of 2004 Dr. 
Steve Van Dessel’s [1] proposed Active Building 
Envelope System (ABE) model and added by a wind 
mill to drive the Swiss-roll heat exchanger, a new 
thermal control technology --- trying to compensate for 
the building envelopes or elsewhere being heat 
transferred, resulting in heat loss and gain (Fig. 1). This 
study has the simulation analysis and experimental 
proof by the reduced size model.

(passive) model of ABE systems 
 
2. LITERATUR REVIEW 
 
In 2004 Dr. Steve Van Dessel’s research team [1] 
presented Active Building Envelope System (ABE) 
which included two basic components, one for the 
Photovoltaic (PV) systems and another for the 
Thermoelectric (TE) system. PV system is to change the 
solar radiation energy into electrical energy. TE system 
device to change the energy into heat energy, or reverse 
the heat into electrical energy (Fig. 2), which from  
 
Fig. 2 Schematic diagrams of the PV system and TE 
system 
 
model analysis we can explicitly calculate the thermal 
conductivity of the envelope of the Qload = 6 W.  In 
2004 Buist et al [2] used of numerical software in the 
TE cooling system and the estimated efficiency of heat 
sink value was lower than that of Dr. Steve Van Dessel's 
model, where when I = 8 amps, a model’s biggest 
efficiency difference was about 10%. 
On the fan part, firstly in 1999, Fuglsang and Madsen [3] 
pointed out at the wind turbine rotors to optimize the 
design with different parameters. In this research we 
also included Wright and Wood’s [4] exploration of the 
low-speed axial wind turbines design and integration of 
empirical formula as well. In 2006 Epaarachchi and 
Clausen [5] proposed a small fan blade to experiment 
measurement the prediction of the fatigue test under a 
load mode.  
Heat exchanger was firstly applied in 2007 by BJ Tsai 
[6] to the micro-turbine engine recuperator for 
preheating combustion to improve engine efficiency. 
Take advantage of heat-re-circulating or excess enthalpy 
of combustion technology, the heat generated by 
burning and through the heat exchanger or other 
equipment will be recycled and reuse in order to 
improve system efficiency, or for other purposes . The 
Swiss roll burner takes advantage of this heat-recycling 
technology to product high-temperature heat to preheat 
the reactants to improve combustion efficiency and 
combustible limit [7]. The above is combination of 
physical components. 
This study considered the actual physical status of the 
increase in ventilation, so that ABE system is more 
accurate and closer to the actual physical condition. As 
described at right side of Figure 1, the so-called new 
model of the ABE system for home space arrangement 
clearly stated the innovative ideas of this study - to use 
air-conditioning aerodynamic mechanisms to achieve 
the integration of wind & solar driven ventilation, 
electricity and heat pump. 
3.  OBJECTIVES AND APPROACHES 
3.1 Model Summary 
 
The studied model of author’s team could be compared 
with the model of Dr. Steve Van Dessel’s group. We 
added the return-air inlet (B vent opening) in the x 
direction. In the y direction it was guided by the wind 
turbine air flow through the Swiss roll heat exchanger to 
produce air-conditioning of the forced convection from 
an A vent opening. This opening could be considered of 
several kinds of thermal generations and can become the 
ABE system heat source. Here it was a simplified model. 
These vent opening only set up for 1 to 2 people and 
considered only for 1 to 2 people’s average heat volume 
for heating and lighting system. The system’s total heat

That means the above quadratic curve equation of speed 
distribution integrated in the range of 0 to 1 (y/h) is 
equivalent to speed with the same average flow speed. 
In accordance with the wind speed at opening, obtain 
results of the average wind speed from equation (3) at 
10 grid-point locations of opening and then key in the 
Airpack software. 
 
3.4 Input Parameters 
 
When using the Airpack software the setting values is as 
follows:  
1. Steady   
2. Flow model: Turbulent (κ-εtwo equation model).  
3. Opening:  
  Temperature at opening: 14 ℃  
  Turbulence intensity: 10% 
 
3.5 Set the Boundary Conditions 
 
By using the Airpak software together with the Central 
Weather Bureau’s meteorological data to calculate and 
simulate atmospheric wind field as boundary conditions. 
Input parameters of the external environment are the 
local wind direction, wind speed, boundary layer 
thickness and terrain factor. The prediction equation of 
atmospheric wind field is:

3.6 Relaxation Factor 
 
When doing analytical analysis, variables cross effects 
each other so easily led to divergence of various 
numbers of flow field data, it is necessary to introduce 
relaxation factor to increase the number of data values 
to deliver the stability of the simulation data set, such as 
the relaxation system shown in Table 1.

3.8 Analysis of Independent Grid 
 
Due to coarse or fineness of grid points may lead to 
different numerical results, thereby affecting the 
credibility of the results, analysis of independent grid 
must be used at different set of grid points in the same 
physical quantity and observe when the grid points 
increases, whether the physical quantities will be 
differed. If it were very different, continued to increase 
grid points until the grid is fine enough did not affect the 
physical quantities then to stop the increase of grid 
points. Fig. 6 is this paper’s numerical model to solve

Fig. 10 The ventilation flow distribution with fan turned 
on (a) and turned off (b) 
 
Fig. 10 (a) (b)’s air flow distribution, analysis and 
comparison of air flow at fan was on (at the top of Fig. 
10 a, b) and the fan was off (at the bottom of Fig.10 a, 
b), we can see from the velocity vector and the flow line, 
the wind comes from the environment. Path from the 
upper right corner and then along the right wall TE 
system, back down to the floor, flow to the left wall 
outlet and then lastly go out from the upper left corner. 
When the fan was on, compared with turned off, it has 
stronger air flow and wind speed. Taking Z = 0m at the 
air-flow situation. The air flow speed of fan turned on 
and turned off can be separated as on (umax = 3.9872m / 
s), off (umax = 1.03314m / s). 
 
4.2 Temperature Simulation Results 
 
Fig. 11 is the comparison of temperature distribution for 
the fan was on (above) and off (below). The gap is 
between solar panels and the TE wall as the hot side. 
The temperature can reach 40 to 45℃. Another side of 
TE produced the cooling effect, and through 
air-conditioning spread cool air to indoor space. Take 
the temperature condition at Y = 1.2m. The indoor 
temperature is 29 to 32 ℃ with fan turning on, or the 
indoor temperature is about 31 to 34℃ without turning 
on the fan. The results show the fan can speed up TE 
cooling cold-side to spread quickly to the entire room. 
(Take 6 temperature test points, the ambient temperature 
is 35℃)

4.3 PMV Value Simulation Results 
 
ISO 7730 has recommended the use of the comfort 
indicators PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) and PPD 
(Predicted Percent of Dissatisfied):  
PMV provides for an average reference, to measure the 
comfortableness of human body in an environment. 
PMV index produced from many different testers, in the 
specific measurement environment, their subjective 
assessment for a number of environmental conditions. It 
is divided into seven stages, ranging from -3 (very cold) 
extends to +3 (extremely warm), neutral point of 0 for 
moderate heat conditions.  
PPD is used to estimate the extent of dissatisfaction of 
human body on the environment.  
Fig. 12 is the PMV value when turning on and off the 
fan, i.e., the smaller the value of PMV, the more 
satisfaction. When the fan was on the indoor PMV value 
was about 0.69 to 1. When the fan was off the indoor 
PMV value was about 0.5 to 0.9.
