excellent electrical conductivity, and chemical stability [5]. 
In order to improve the performance of EDLC, it is effective to enlarge the surface area of 
the electrode materials [6]. CNTs with a large surface area could be prepared using smaller 
diameter CNTs [7]. The diameter of CNTs is governed by the size of the catalyst nano-particle 
[8]. It is reported that catalyst nano-particles with small size could be distributed uniformly using 
an Al buffer film, deposited onto the substrate before the catalyst metal film is deposited [9]. 
Therefore, the surface morphology of the synthesized CNTs could be controlled with or without 
Al film deposition between the substrate and catalyst film. On the other hand, the electrolyte 
solution also affects the specific capacitance [10,11]. For example, the specific capacitance of 
EDLC using LiN(SO2CF3)2– acetamide electrolyte was about 22 F/g. The specific capacitance of 
the same EDLC using KOH electrolyte was 25 F/g [11]. In this research, thermal chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) was used to synthesize CNTs. CNTs with different morphologies and different 
electrolyte solution concentrations (H2SO4 and KOH) were investigated to measure the specific 
EDLC capacitance using electrochemical methods. 
 
2.研究方法 
 A stainless steel (SUS) sheet was used as the template for CNT growth. The size of the 
SUS sheet is 10 mm×10 mm. Al film (10 nm), as a buffer layer, was deposited onto the SUS 
sheet. Fe film (3 nm), used as a catalyst, was then deposited at room temperature using thermal 
evaporation at a pressure of less than 2×10-5 Torr. Annealing was carried out at 750℃ for 60 
min to form Fe catalyst nano-particles. Thermal CVD was subsequently performed using C2H2 
gas under a pressure of 4 Torr and NH3 gas under the pressure of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 Torr at a growth 
temperature of 750℃. The CNT growth duration was 20 min. Surface morphological analysis 
was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Internal structure analysis was 
performed with a high resolution transmission electron microscope(TEM). Raman spectroscopy 
was used to investigate carbon hybridization. Electrochemical measurements were performed in a 
three-electrode arrangement. H2SO4 with different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 M) was 
used as the electrolyte solution. And KOH with different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 
2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 M) used as the electrolyte solution. 
 
3.結果與討論 
 Fig.1(a) shows the 75°-tilted SEM image of CNTs synthesized onto the Fe/SUS sheet. 
The Al buffer film was not deposited before the Fe film was deposited. The film surface exhibits 
randomly oriented CNTs. The height of the randomly oriented CNT is about 5 μm. Fig. 1(b) 
shows the enlarged SEM image of the randomly oriented CNTs. The average diameter of the 
randomly oriented CNTs is about 35 nm. Fig. 1c shows a cross-section image of the CNTs 
deposited onto the Fe/Al/SUS sheet, aligned perpendicular to the Fe/Al/SUS sheet. The average 
diameter of the vertically aligned CNTs is about 25 nm. The aligned CNTs synthesized on the 
Fe/Al/SUS sheet have an average height of about 18.8 μm and a number density of about 10×10 
cm-2.  
Fig. 2(a) shows a TEM image of the synthesized CNT. It indicates that the CNT has a 
 4
confirmed [12]. The peak position shifts to high wavenumber after N incorporation due to the 
tensile stress induced by N doping [11]. D bands of N-doped CNTs synthesized at the pressure of 
NH3 gas of 2, 4, 6, 8 Torr appeared at 1352, 1354, 1355,1355 cm-1, respectively. And G band 
appeared at 1582, 1585, 1587, 1587 cm-1. 
Fig. 10 shows the curves of capacitance versus the concentration of KOH electrolyte and 
the pressure of NH3 gas. From Fig. 10(a), we found that when the KOH electrolyte concentration 
was higher then 0.5 M, the capacitance increased linearly and slowly. But if the KOH electrolyte 
concentration was lower than 0.5 M, the capacitance declined sharply with the decreasing 
concentration. From Fig. 10(b), we found that when the pressure of NH3 was 6 Torr, the 
capacitance had the best value. It could be that the nitrogen will doped on CNTs more when the 
pressure of NH3 was increasing. And when the pressure of NH3 was 8 Torr, the defect of CNTs 
increased a lot to casuse. Fig. 11 shows the corresponding intensity ratio of D to G bands in the 
Raman spectrum. The curve shows that the intensity ratio of D to G bands was not obvious when 
the pressure of NH3 gas was increasing from 0 to 6 Torr. But at the pressure of 8 Torr, the ratio 
increased obviously. The ratio would be related to structural defect of CNTs caused by the 
incorporation of nitrogen. 
Fig. 12(a) shows the initial charge-discharge curves versus the curve after being measured 
for 500 times of CNTs with NH3 treatment. The capacitance of  CNTs increased a little for being 
measured for 500 cycles. It would be that when we started to measure the charge-discharge 
curves, the electrolyte did not contact the electrode surface completely. But after 500 cycles 
measurement, due to the electrolyte flow into CNTs, resulting in increasing the interface area 
between the electrolyte and electrode. Therefore, the capacitance had a little increase through the 
500 cycles measurements. 
 
4.結論 
We used CNTs as the EDLC electrode and measured the specific capacitances. The 
surface morphology of the synthesized CNTs could be controlled with or without an Al film 
deposited between the SUS sheet and Fe catalyst film. This showed that the vertically aligned 
CNT electrode has a larger specific surface area than the randomly oriented CNTs, resulting in a 
greater charge stored in the aligned CNTs. The vertically aligned CNTs have a greater specific 
capacitance. This also shows that the specific capacitance of the EDLC test device increased with 
increasing electrolyte solution concentration. When the electrolyte solution concentration is 
higher than 1.5 M, the CNTs were ablated from the SUS sheet and the specific capacitance could 
not be measured. In order to obtain CNTs with NH3 treatment with higher capacitance, the 
pressure of NH3 should be a suitable value, not too large or too small (for example, 6 Torr in our 
experiment). And the CNTs had good cycle life and stability for being a supercapacitor device.
