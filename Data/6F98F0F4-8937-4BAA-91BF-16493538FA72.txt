2Aerosol Research and Characterization Study (SEARCH) in 1999-2001. In28
California, NH4+, NO3-, SO42-, OC and EC were the most abundant components of29
PM2.5 (10-13). In general, ionic species also contributed to particulate matter in30
many areas. Results indicated that SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ were the main31
water-soluble ionic species in PM2.5 in Korea, Hong Kong, and Switzerland, and three32
species occupied over 30% of the mass in PM2.5 (14-16).33
In Taiwan, air pollution episode is most often caused by particulate matter and34
ozone. Therefore, the control of particulate matter is important for the improvement35
of air quality. Lin (17) investigated PM2.5 compositions and established that SO42-,36
NO3- and NH4+ were the major ionic species, occupying 42.2% of the PM2.5 mass and37
90% of the total water-soluble ionic species. Chen et al. (18) investigated the acid38
aerosol concentrations in Taipei and determined that the concentrations of SO2, HNO3,39
HONO, SO42-, NO3- and NO2- were 3.3-8.7 ppb, 0.2-3.0 ppb, 0.5-5.1 ppb, 4.6-33.9g40
m-3, 0.8-6.6 g m-3, and 0.2-0.9 g m-3, respectively. These papers established that41
ionic species were important components of particulate mass, especially in42
ammonium, sulfate and nitrate.43
Some previous studies have investigated the composition characteristics of PM,44
but few have considered the day and night variations in particulate compositions.45
Furthermore, water-soluble ionic species were the major compounds in all fine46
particulate matter except carbon. In southern Taiwan, the atmosphere is a high-47
frequency air-quality episode air basin that is usually due to particulate matter and48
ozone pollution. Therefore, it is important to investigate the ionic compositions of49
PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 to understand the ionic species characteristics of air quality50
episodes both during the day and at night.51

2. EXPERIMENTAL53
2.1. Sampling program54
4periods was WNW and NW at both sampling sites. Therefore, sea salt and local82
emissions could have been a source of the particulates. In addition, the wind speed83
at Tzuoying was higher than at Daliao, which may cause high sea salt contribution at84
Tzuoying during the daytime.85
The wind direction was significantly different between daytime (7:00 am to86
7:00 pm) and nighttime (7:00 am to 7:00 pm). During the daytime, over 70% of the87
winds were W, WNW, and NW; in contrast, at night, 75% were N, NNE, NE and NEE88
(data not shown). The wind direction is affected by the land-sea breeze, monsoons,89
and topography.90
91
2.2. Particulate matter sampling method92
Ambient particulate matter was taken by a dichotomous sampler (Graseby93
Adenson G 241, USA). The dichotomous sampler was equipped with an inlet of 1094
m cutpoint. Particulate matter below 10 m aerodynamic diameter (PM10) was95
divided into two size fractions when entering the sampler using a virtual impactor96
with a 2.5 m cutpoint. The two size fractions were classified as a coarse fraction97
(2.5m < aerodynamic diameter < 10 m, PM10-2.5) and a fine fraction (aerodynamic98
diameter < 2.5 m, PM2.5). Particulate mass concentration of PM10 is the sum of99
PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 in this study. The total flow rate of the dichotomous sampler was100
16.7 l min-1. It was split into 1.67 and 15 l min-1 for coarse and fine flow, respectively.101
Twenty-six samples were taken for each cut size (fine and coarse particles), with a102
total of 104 samples for both cut size particles at the two stations.103
Particulate matter was collected using 37 mm quartz fiber filters (Pallflex104
2500 QAT-UP, 37 mm) supported by polyolefin rings. Filters were pre-treated105
before sampling at 900oC for 2 h to reduce the carbonaceous species background level106
and interference by other volatile species in the filter and reduce the artifact effect107
caused by the filter. The background concentration of ionic species in filter was108
60.05, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, and, 0.10g m-3, respectively.136
The ionic species standard mixed solution was spiked into the quartz fiber137
filter, and the filter was then dried at room temperature. The dried filter followed the138
analysis procedures of the samples to measure the ionic species concentration. In139
addition, the recovery of Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, F-, Br-, and140
NO2- was 90, 115, 104, 106, 110, 112, 99, 97, 113, 97 and 102 %, respectively.141
Some recovery variations of ionic species were 10-15%, which is in the acceptable142
range. In addition, the ion charge balance was checked in every filter sample, and143
the anion to cation charge ratio was 0.96-1.11.144
145
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION146
Particulate Matter Concentration147
Table 1 shows the particulate concentrations in Daliao and Tzuoying. PM2.5148
and PM10 concentrations were 6424 and 9826g m-3, respectively in Daliao. The149
mass concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in Tzouying were 4924 and 8633 g m-3,150
respectively.151
The ratios of PM2.5/PM10 of Daliao and Tzuoying were 0.64 and 0.55,152
respectively. The percentage of fine particles in PM10 was higher than that of the153
coarse particles. The result is the same as those reported in Table 1. In addition,154
the PM2.5/PM10 ratio and particulate concentrations at night were a little higher than155
those measured during the day. This could be due to the fact that the mixing height156
at night (less than 800 m) is lower than during the day (more than 1000 m)(mixing157
height not shown). Coarse particulate matter may not be as easily transported at158
night (lower transport flux). Further work is required to identify the various sources159
contributing to the particulate matter.160
The PM10 correlation coefficient between filter sampling and EPA monitoring161
data was 0.89 and 0.95 for Daliao and Tzuoying, respectively. The particulate mass162
8al. (35) indicated that NaNO3 is formed on the surface of an existing coarse mode sea190
salt or mineral dust particle, and NaNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 can be collected in the coarse191
mode. Therefore, NaNO3 mainly existed in the coarse particles while also found in192
fine particles. NOx was most often the precursor of NO3-. NOx can be converted193
into HNO3 and combines with NH3 to form nitrate as a secondary aerosol by194
homogeneous or heterogeneous photochemical reactions (36-37).195
Kaneyasu et al. (38) also found that nitrate and non-sea salt are predominant in196
fine particles because of local pollution. The Kaohsiung industrial metropolitan area197
is an ozone non-attainment region with a power plant, industries (petrochemical198
industry, iron and steel plant etc), and motor vehicles being the major sources of NOx.199
Therefore, the local combustion sources (i.e., coal and heavy oil consumption) are200
important source of gaseous precursors of nitrate in fine particles.201
Gas emissions of precursor gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and202
ammonia convert to particles of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), ammonium sulfate203
((NH4)2SO4), ammonium bisulfate (NH4HSO4), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfur204
dioxide gas converts to particulate sulfate through gaseous and aqueous phase205
transformation pathways. Solar radiation induces photochemical reactions that206
create hydroxyl radicals to react with atmospheric constituents. In addition, the207
reactions in the aqueous phase (i.e., high relative humidity, fog or cloud conditions)208
are much faster than gas-phase reactions. While the relative humidity reaches the209
deliquescence relative humidity, the aerosol is a liquid solution. Therefore, the210
humidity could change the chemical composition, and the accompanying phase211
transformation could significantly affect the hydroscopic character of the aerosol (39).212
In this study, the fine mode always dominated the distribution of sulfate.213
Neither condensation of vapor nor coagulation of smaller particulate matter was214
verified as the formation mechanism for particles of around 0.5-0.7 m, because the215
growth time scale of condensation particles to residual size is much shorter than the216
10
Day and Night Variation of Ionic Species244
Table 3 shows the ionic species concentrations with day and night245
variations. In general, there were no significant differences in the mass246
concentrations of sulfate, sodium ions, potassium ions, and calcium ions between247
day and night. Sodium ion content in the coarse particles was about 20-30%248
higher in the daytime for both stations. But the difference was insignificant using249
the t-test method. However, the concentrations of chlorine ions, nitrate, and250
ammonium were higher at night than during the day.251
During the day, the nitrate concentrations were predominant in coarse252
particulate matter (PM10-2.5), while at night they were higher in fine particles. In the253
fine particles, the nitrate concentration at night was 5.0 and 5.5 times higher than the254
concentration during the day at Daliao and Tzuoying, respectively. This may be255
attributed to the photochemical reaction during the day, which consumed the nitrate in256
the fine particles. In addition, the chloride ion concentration at night was also higher257
than during the day. Chloride ion concentration in fine particles at night was about258
8.6 and 9.6 times higher than the day concentration in Tzuoying and Daliao,259
respectively. In addition, the meteorological parameters, i.e., mixing height and260
wind speed, were another reason to expect source emission and chemical reactions in261
the atmosphere.262
Furthermore, the ammonium concentration in fine particulate at night was263
higher than during the day. The night/day ratio of ammonium concentration was 1.5264
at Tzuoying and 1.9 at Daliao in PM2.5.265
Kadowaki (45) and Yao et al. (46) revealed that chloride depletion in sea salt266
due to higher gaseous HNO3 may lead to the reduction of coarse particle chloride. A267
higher nitrate percentage may also be due to the formation of NaNO3. Generally,268
coarse particles were not the dominate nitrate mode. Therefore, the chloride must269
have another significant formation mechanism besides sea salt. Chlorine in coal270
12
0.040.03 mol m-3 during the day and 0.030.02 mol m-3 at night. Results297
indicated that the chlorine loss occurred more easily during the day than at night.298
The chlorine loss reaction may be expressed as follows:299
NaCl(PM) + HNO3(g) NaNO3(PM) + HCl(g) and NaCl(PM) + 2NO2(g) NaNO3(PM) +300
NOCl(g).301
where (PM) is the species concentration in particulate matter.302
The chlorine loss during the day was higher than at night, and the chlorine loss at303
night may be caused by the acids (i.e., HNO3 and H2SO4) and NO2 reacting with NaCl304
to produce HCl (48) and NOCl gas (49), respectively.305
According to the t-test, the day and night concentrations of Cl-, NO3-, NH4+306
were significantly different in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at Daliao. In coarse307
particulate matter, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were also different during the day and at308
night at Daliao. Daliao is an industrial rural area, with many agricultural and309
industrial activities. NH4+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ can be emitted from the agricultural310
activities, i.e., fertilizer, cultivation, and soil, in Daliao. At Tzuoying, the coarse311
particulate ionic species were insignificant during the day and at night. But the Cl-,312
NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in fine particles during the day and at night were313
significantly different at Tzuoying. In fine particles, Cl-, NO3- and NH4+ were314
different during the day and at night at both sampling sites. This may be caused by a315
chemical reaction in the atmosphere and emission variations between day and night.316
317
Ionic Species Correlation318
Correlation of ionic species in coarse particle319
Table 4 shows the correlation of mass concentration of ionic species during320
the day and at night for coarse particulates. There was a high correlation between321
Na+, Mg2+ and Cl- for coarse particulate ionic species in the daytime, especially in322
Tzuoying. They may come from the same sea salt source (chemical composition of323
14
potential compounds during the daytime in Daliao. In addition, CaSO4, (NH4)HSO4,351
and (NH4)2SO4 were the potential compounds in Tzuoying.352
At night, chloride had a high correlation to NO3-, NH4+ and Ca2+ in both353
sampling stations. K+ showed a high correlation to NO3-, SO42- and NH4+ in Daliao.354
Therefore, NH4Cl, NH4NO3, CaCl2, K2SO4, KNO3, NH4NO3, (NH4)HSO4, and355
(NH4)2SO4 were the potential compounds in the fine particles. There was a high356
NH4+ correlation to Cl-, NO3-, and SO42- in Tzuoying. Ca2+ maintained a moderate357
correlation to Cl-, NO3- and K+ at night. In Tzuoying, CaCl2, NH4Cl, Ca(NO3)2,358
NH4NO3, (NH4)HSO4, and (NH4)2SO4 were the potential chemicals at night.359
Shimohara et al. (50) investigated the chemical form and reaction of airborne360
gaseous and particulate matter in northern Kyushu, Japan. Results indicated that361
NaNO3, Ca(NO3)2, (NH4)2SO4, (NH4)HSO4, NH4Cl, and NH4NO3 formed the main362
chemical particulate compositions.363
Reactions of sulfur dioxide to particulate sulfate and nitrogen oxides to364
particulate nitrate compete with each other for available hydroxyl radicals and365
ammonia. Ammonium reacts preferentially with sulfuric acid to form ammonium366
bisulfate and ammonium sulfate, and the amount of ammonium nitrate formed is367
significant only when the total ammonia exceeds the sulfate by a factor of two or368
more on a mole basis.369
In fine particles, sulfate is balanced by NH4+ and strong acid. However,370
some NH4+ can be associated with nitrate. Pathak et al. (51) found that acidity, NH4+371
and SO42- can be categorized into two regimes based on the particulate ammonium to372
sulfate molar ratio   

significant amount of free acid and little or no ammonium nitrate.376

ammonium, and chloride concentrations were higher at night than during the day at403
both sampling sites. NH4NO3 and NH4Cl are volatilized more easily during the404
daytime than at night because of the temperature and photochemical reactions. In405
the sampling periods, the molar ratio of ammonium and sulfate was higher than 2 at406
both sampling sites, which indicated that the ambient particles were rich in407
ammonium. Therefore, (NH4)2SO4, (NH4)HSO4, and NH4NO3 might be the408
particulate chemical compositions, especially in the fine mode. Although the study409
proposes some potential species in coarse and fine particles, it is still necessary to410
collect enough data and further study to prove the reaction mechanisms.411
