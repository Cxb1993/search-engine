此時諧振槽之電感抗與電容抗互相抵消，呈電阻性負
載，電路阻抗最小，電流最大[10]。本文利用一鎖相
迴路控制器控制其電路切換頻率操作在略高於諧振
頻率點上，以實現零電壓切換，並提供最大功率輸出。

三、電路結構 
本文所提出之諧振頻率調控式高頻弦波電源供
應器使用開關控制電容器達成輸出電壓之調節。開關
控制電容器架構，如圖5中虛線部分所示，係由功率
電晶體 sQ 、二極體 sD 與電容器 2pC 並聯所組成
[7-9]。主要藉由改變功率電晶體 sQ 之導通週期，以
得出不同等效電容值，進而改變半橋串並聯諧振換流
器之並聯諧振電容值，依此則改變諧振電路之特性，
達成輸出電壓之調節[28-30]。 
開關控制電容器電路動作時序，如圖6 所示， cpI
為流過開關控制電容器之電流， gsV 為功率電晶體 sQ
之控制訊號， abV 為電容器 2pC 之跨壓。其電路動作
分成四個工作狀態[9]： 
 
工作狀態一 ( ) ≤≤ 10 ttt   
功率電晶體 sQ 呈導通狀態，電流 cpI 為正弦形式
之正電流，且流過功率電晶體 sQ ，此時開關控制電
容器等效為短路。

圖 11 和圖 12 分別為一般電壓調節方式與開關
控制電容器調節方式之電路波形。由圖 11 可知，直
流輸入電壓約為 150V，而一般電壓調節方式之輸入
電流均方根值為 5.5A，因此，輸入功率約為 825W，
輸出電壓及輸出電流分別為 166V 與 3.46A。而以開
關控制電容器調節方式之直流輸入電壓約為 150V，
輸入電流均方根值為 5.1A，輸入功率約為 765W，輸
出電壓及輸出電流分別為 166V 與 3.46A。表 2 為一
般電壓調節方式與開關控制電容器電壓調節方式之
比較。一般諧振換流器之調節方式將造成諧振槽輸入
電壓 dv 與輸入電流 Li 有著較大之相位差。本文所提
出之開關控制電容器之電壓調節方式為降低諧振電
路之電壓增益，且配合鎖相迴路控制器，當電路於調
節輸出電壓時，電路仍可保持操作在略高於諧振頻
率，故諧振槽輸入電壓 dv 與輸入電流 Li 有著較小之
相位差。且又由表 2 與圖 12 可知，一般電壓調節方
式的輸入電流 iI 之電流峰值較大，將造成功率電晶體
之電流應力(Current Stress)較高。而輸入電流 iI 之均
方根值也較大，將造成功率電晶體之功率損失較高，
導致電路效率降低。藉由以上之分析可得證，本文所
提出之開關控制電容器電壓調節方式有效降低損
失，故可提升系統效率。

Abstract—This paper proposes the improvements of the new 
structure of a brushless DC (BLDC) motor for the ceiling fan. 
The new type ceiling fan is first designed by using BLDC servo 
motor theory and the six-step wave form for the purpose of the 
manufacture cost reduction. The energy also can be saved at least 
50% when the new type motor is compared to the conventional 
fan based on the induction motor. The new BLDC motor is 
required to meet both of the basic ceiling fan control and the cost 
reduction. 
Index Terms—ceiling fan, brushless DC (BLDC) motor, speed 
controller, hall sensor. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
The conventional ceiling fan based on the induction motor 
is popular. Those split-phase induction motor are external 
rotor machines with large diameter and large size. They are 
usually low-cost machines and operated at high slip, therefore, 
the ceiling fan have poor performance. The performance of the 
external-rotor split-phase induction motor has been improved 
by using the 2-D finite element analysis [1]. However, the 
pulsating torque and efficient of the fan is still a problem. 
For the energy conservation reason, the development and 
commercialization of high efficiency electric motor is required 
for the ceiling fan. The high efficiency electric motor drivers 
system can replace the ceiling fan which is base on the 
induction motor.  
In order to reduce the consumption of the electric energy, the 
brushless dc (BLDC) motor with high efficiency can be a good 
motor for the ceiling fan [2].  
The BLDC motor also has many advantages like high 
efficiency, compact volume and less noise. In this paper, the 
new type ceiling fan is first designed by using the BLDC motor 
theory [3-6] and the six-step wave form for the purpose of the 
manufacture cost reduction. The energy will be saved when the 
new type motor is compared to the conventional induction 
motor fan. The new BLDC motor is also required to meet both 
of the basic ceiling fan control and the cost reduction. 
II. THE MOTOR DESIGN AND DRIVERS SYSTEM 
A. the motor design 
For the commercialization limit, the BLDC motor of the 
ceiling fan is designed to meet the basic requirement. The 
operating condition of the BLDC motor is listed as follow： 
• input power : AC source 110V or 220V  
• speed range : 90 rpm to 200 rpm 
• speed change: at least 3 step( 100rpm for low speed. 
160rmp for mid speed, and 200 rpm for hi speed) 
The new BLDC motor is designed as an external-rotor motor 
with 8 poles and 12 slots shown as in fig. 1. There are 12 single 
layer coils on the 12 slots for the reduction of the assembly line. 
The inverter will provide the 3 phase current on those coils, 
then the fan motor has the rotating torque. 
 
Fig.1. motor cross section (8 poles, 12slots), the stator is 
internal to rotor and each slot will contain single layer winding. 
The rotor contains the number of 8 poles.

IV. TEST RESULTS  
 
A. The conventional ceiling fan 
The conventional ceiling fan based on split-phase 
induction motor is listed under the single phase power 
supply 110V or 220V. The consumption of the electric 
power corresponding to 3 steps speed control is listed in 
the table 1.

During the hi-speed operation, the consumption power with 
the unit power factor (P.F.) is about 65W show as in fig.7. 
When the fan operates in mid-speed, the current is leading the 
input voltage 30 degree. This shows that the good product of 
the convention ceiling fan has a good power factor.

rotation speed of the BLDC motor is adjusted to be those of the 
conventional ceiling fan. The table 2 shows the input power 
corresponding to the 3 fixed rotation speeds. The table 3 and 
the fig.9. shows the compare of the input power between two 
motors. During any of the operation speed, the energy saving of 
the new BLDC motor is about 50%. However, the power factor 
correction is also required to improve the power factor.

Abstract— This paper aims to explore the optimal Li-ion 
battery charging frequency by using AC impedance technique. 
The experiment proves that the optimal charging frequency is 
the point of the minimum AC impedance. In such a situation of 
the battery charged by the optimal charging frequency, the 
charging time and charging efficiency are improved above 
30.68% and 30.6%. 
Key words: Lithium-ion battery, AC impedance 
I.  Introduction 
As electronic technology has developed rapidly day by day, 
portable electronic appliances, such as mobile phones, laptops, 
and MP3 players, become more and more popular. For these 
portable electronic appliances the rechargeable batteries 
become quite an important and necessary power source. 
Consequently, the battery charging technique becomes more 
and more important. Nowadays, many battery charging 
techniques were proposed, such as the constant trickle current 
(CTC) charging, the constant current (CC) charging, and the 
constant current and constant voltage (CC-CV) charging [1].  
Among them, the CC-CV is used most widely, but its function 
is still not able to meet the users’ needs.  Consequently, the 
fuzzy control, neutral network, genetic algorithms, ant 
algorithms, and grey prediction are applied to obtain better 
battery charging performance[2]-[6].   
Unfortunately, the application of these intelligent techniques 
in designing systematic circuitry is complicated and expensive. 
Hence, phase-locked-loop technique is used to design a PLL 
based battery charger to achieve the purpose of high 
performance and low cost [7]-[11]. Recently advanced battery 
charging systems use the pulse current/voltage pattern  
charging to obtain the evener distribution of ions in the battery 
electrolyte, attains to the purpose of slowing down the 
polarization of the battery, and advances the charging speed 
and the cycle life[12]-[17]. In this type of pulse charging 
system, the charging frequency relates to the battery charge 
time and the charging capacity. In practices, the ways of try-
and-error experience is used, but they are ineffective. Recently, 
the use of the pulse charging system with the variable 
frequency has been suggested. It can detect the best pulse 
charging frequency of a charged battery so that it can advance 
the charging speed. However, the impedance effect is not yet 
studied in detail [18]. 
For these reasons, this paper explores the optimal Li-ion 
battery charging frequency by analyzing the relationship 
between the AC impedance of a battery and its charging 
performance. According to the analysis of the Bode plot of the 
AC impedance, we can get the minimum AC impedance 
frequency 
minZf .  Experimental result demonstrates that the 
charging time and the charging efficiency are improved by 
using pulse charging with 
minZf .  
Ⅱ.  AC Impedance Analysis 
In the past few decades, AC impedance analysis was widely 
used in the research of electrochemistry. Fig 1(a) shows the Li-
ion battery AC impedance model. This model includes an 
ohmic resistance oR , a charging transfer resistance ctR , a 
Warburg impedance wZ , a capacitance dC , and an electrode 
inductance dL [18]-[22].  Fig 1(b) shows the battery equivalent 
circuit model formed by an impedance batteryZ  and an ideal 
battery.

In the electric circuit view, the AC impedance of the 
battery can be charged by different battery charging frequency. 
This means that we can find a optimal battery charging 
frequency that corresponding to the minimum AC impedance. 
         
A SONY 18650 2000mAh Li-ion battery is used to test.

In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed 
methods, we additionally use the other four different 
frequencies 50Hz, 500Hz, 5KHz, and 8KHz to assess the 
charging time and charging efficiency. Fig 5 shows the 
battery voltage and current waveforms when   battery is 
charged by the proposed battery charging platform. As show 
in Fig 5, the peak-to-peak current is 1A, and the battery 
charging voltage is 3.6V. The waveforms of the battery 
charging voltage and current were charged by 500Hz, 
minZf and 8 KHz are shown in Figs 6, 7 and 8, respectively. 
We can see that different charging frequency results in 
different battery AC voltage ACV . This indicate that the AC 
impedance of battery actually changed by different charging 
frequency.
