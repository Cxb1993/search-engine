Abstract   
The research is aimed to investigate the 
compressive strengths of glass/epoxy 
nanocomposites, containing various loadings of 
spherical silica nanoparticles.  Through a sol-gel 
technique, the silica particles with a diameter of 25 
nm were exfoliated uniformly into the epoxy resin.  
Subsequently, by inserting the silica epoxy 
mixture into the unidirectional glass fiber through 
a vacuum hand lay-up process, the glass 
fiber/epoxy composite laminates with 10, 20, and 
30 wt% of silica nanoparticles were fabricated.  
Quasi-static and dynamic compression tests were 
conducted on the brick composite specimens with 
fiber orientations of 0°, 5°, 10°, 15°, and 90° using 
a hydraulic MTS machine and a Split Hopkinson 
Pressure Bar (SHPB), respectively.  Observations 
on the failure specimens indicated that for fiber 
orientations less than 15 degrees, the fiber 
microbuckling is the dominant failure mechanism.  
On the other hand, for the 90 degree samples, the 
out-of-plane shear failure is the main failure 
mechanism.  In addition, it was denoted that as 
the silica contents increase, the compressive 
strengths of the glass/epoxy composites are 
improved accordingly.  The enhancing 
mechanism in the compressive strengths can be 
properly explicated using the microbuckling mode

1. Introduction 
With extensive applications of composites, 
the demand for the materials possessing the 
characteristics of high stiffness and strength is 
increasing.  However, because the compressive 
strengths of fiber composites are lower when 
compared to its tensile strength, the compressive 
failures have been of great concern to the 
composite community.  In past decades, the 
compressive strengths of unidirectional 
composites were effectively predicted by using 
either the microbuckling model [1, 2] or the 
 2 
 
vacuum-assisted hand lay-up procedures were 
adopted for preparing the glass fiber/silica/epoxy 
nanocomposites.  The mixture of silica/epoxy 
and the D-230 curing agent was poured on one 
dry unidirectional glass fiber layer (provided by 
Vectorply®, E-LR0908-14 unidirectional 
E-glass fiber).  The compound was impregnated 
into the dry fiber using a hand roller until the 
fiber bundles were permeated completely by the 
resin.  Then, another ply of dry fiber was 
stacked on it.  The repeating process continued 
until the 22 layers of glass fibers were fabricated.  
The fiber stack was sandwiched between two 
steel plates with porous Teflon fabric on the 
surfaces, and it was then sealed within a vacuum 
bag. The whole laminates were cured in a hot 
press with a suggested temperature profile under 
vacuum conditions.  It is noted that the vacuum 
is an essential process for forming 
nanocomposites because it can facilitate the 
removal of the tiny bubbles trapped in the 
nanocomposites.  In this study, the laminates 
consisting of 0, 10, 20, and 30 wt% silica 
nanoparticles were prepared.  Off-axis brick 
specimens with fiber orientations of 0°, 5°, 10°, 
15°, and 90° with dimensions of 
8mm×6mm×6mm as shown in Figure 1 were cut 
from the laminates using a diamond wheel.  
The fiber volume fraction for all the off-axis 
specimens is around 45%. 
In order to evaluate the quality of dispersion 
of the silica nanoparticles in the epoxy matrix, 
the epoxy samples were examined using a 
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).  
Samples with around 70 nm thickness for TEM 
analysis were prepared using a microtome at the 
cryogenic condition.  TEM observations of 
epoxy/silica nanocomposites were carried out by 
a JEOL 200CX with an acceleration voltage of 
120KV.  The micrographics of the 
nanocomposites with 20 wt% silica nanoparticles 
at 50,000 and 100,000 magnifications were 
illustrated, respectively, in Figure 2.  It was 
shown that the particles were well dispersed and 
homogeneously distributed in the 
nanocomposites.  In addition, most of the 
nanoparticles were in spherical shape and the 
average diameter was around 25 nm.  Therefore, 
based on the TEM observations, it was suggested 
that the present samples were regarded as the 
nanocomposites with fully dispersed spherical 
nanoparticles.  
 
3. Experimental procedure  
In order to understand the silica particle 
influence on the compressive strengths, the fiber 
composites with various silica loadings were 
tested to failure under compressive loadings.  
Both quasi-static and dynamic compression tests 
were performed on the samples using a 
conventional hydraulic MTS machine and a Split 
Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB), respectively.  
 
3.1 Quasi-static compression tests 
Off-axis brick specimens with fiber 
orientations of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 90 degrees 
(against the long direction) were employed for the 
measurement of compressive strengths.  The 
brick specimens were lapped on a lapping 
machine with a 3 μm abrasive slurry to ensure 
smooth and flat loading surfaces.  In addition, a 
lubricant was applied to the end surfaces of the 
specimen to reduce contact friction.  The 
compressive forces were applied to the samples 
through the end loading fixture attached by a pair 
of tungsten carbide disks as shown in Figure 3.  
A self-adjusting device, as shown in Figure 3, was 
used to eliminate potential bending moments and 
also to ensure that the specimen was in full contact 
with the loading surfaces.  All tests were 
conducted at a hydraulic MTS machine with a 
strain rate of 0.0001/s.  The applied load and 
displacement for each test were recorded using 
LabVIEW software with a PC computer.  The 
maximum value in the load–displacement curve 
was regarded as the failure stress of the sample in 
the quasi-static tests. 
 
3.2 Dynamic compression tests 
High strain rate experiments were conducted 
using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB), 
which is a simple and effective device for dynamic 
tests.  The SHPB setup used in this study was 
made of hardened steel bars, which were 13.3 mm 
 4 
 
Tables 1–5, respectively.  It is noted that for each 
case, at least four samples were tested.  
Apparently, the compressive strengths of fiber 
composites are sensitive to the loading rates, and 
when the loading rates increase, the materials 
demonstrate higher failure stresses.  Moreover, 
the compressive strengths of the fiber composites 
are improved as the silica loading increases, and 
the incremental percentages caused by the silica 
nanoparticles in both quasi-static and dynamic 
cases are almost the same.  It is noted that the 
compressive strength does not seem to increase 
consistently as particle loading increases.  This is 
especially obvious for the case with silica loading 
of 20wt%.  The possible reason for the little 
reduction in the 20 wt% samples could be the 
larger fiber misalignment generated during the 
fabrication of the fiber composites.  The fiber 
misalignment which is a manufacturing defect 
created by fiber movement in the matrix during 
the lay-up and curing process may influence the 
compressive strength of the fiber composites [2, 
14].  In general, the variation of the fiber 
misalignment is more significant in the hand-made 
fiber composites and this could be responsible for 
the reduction of the compressive strength in the 
20wt% samples.  
For the 0o, 5o, 10o, and 15o samples, the main 
failure mechanisms are the fiber microbuckling, so 
the enhancement in compressive strength modified 
by the silica nanoparticles can be explained using 
the microbuckling model [2].  In the 
microbuckling model, the compressive failure was 
assumed triggered because of fiber microbuckling 
imbedded in the matrix as shown in Figure 10.  
By taking into account the nonlinear behavior of 
the matrix in the bifurcation buckling analysis, 
Sun and Jun derived the compressive strength of 
unidirectional fiber composites as

where epmG  is the elastic–plastic tangent shear 
modulus of the matrix, and cf denotes the fiber 
volume fraction of the composites.  According to 
eqn (1), it is implied that the compressive strength 
of the composites can be enhanced if the tangent 
shear modulus of the matrix is improved.  From 
our previous experiments on the constitutive 
behaviors of silica/epoxy nanocomposites [15], it 
was revealed that the Young’s modulus of the 
epoxy matrix was effectively modified by using 
silica nanoparticles as shown in Figure 11.  The 
improvement occurred not only in the elastic part 
but also in the nonlinear ranges.  Thus, the 
corresponding tangent modulus of the matrix 
could be efficiently modified by the nanoparticles 
and so was the tangent shear modulus if the 
isotropic property was assumed in the silica/epoxy 
matrix system.  In view of the forgoing, it is quite 
sensible that the compressive strengths of fiber 
composites can be appropriately enhanced by 
silica nanoparticles.  In addition, it was depicted 
that the constitutive behavior of the epoxy matrix 
is influenced by the loading rate, and when the 
loading rates are increased, the epoxy materials 
would become stiffer [16].  Therefore, because of 
the stiffened behavior of matrix under dynamic 
loading, the dynamic compressive strengths of the 
fiber composites are higher than the quasi-static 
ones.  It should be noted that the microbuckling 
stress given in eqn (1) is evaluated in the fiber 
direction (0 degree), and hence the compressive 
failure stresses as well as their sensitivity to the 
silica nanoparticles are dependent on the fiber 
orientation with respect to the loading direction.   
On the other hand, for the 90o samples, 
although the failure mechanism is out of plane 
shear failure, the failure stresses are also improved 
by the silica nanoparticles.  In order to further 
understand the enhancing mechanism caused by 
the silica nanoparticles, the failure surfaces of the 
samples were examined by the Scanning Electric 
Microscopy (SEM).  The SEM micrographs on 
the fracture surfaces of the samples with pure 
epoxy resin and 30 wt% silica nanoparticles are 
compared in Figure 12.  It is indicated that for the 
fiber composites with pure epoxy, the fiber 
surfaces are quite smooth and featureless without 
any matrix adhered.  It is apparent that the 
interfacial debonding is the main failure

Abstract. This research aims to investigate the effects of particle size, volume fraction and dispersion 
on the tensile strengths of particulate nanocomposites with an embedded crack.  The finite element 
micromechanical model in conjunction with linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) was used to 
study the particle effect on the fracture behavior of nanocomposites.  Results indicated that the tensile 
strength of particulate composites increases when the particle size is decreasing, however it can be 
deduced dramatically by the local aggregation of particles.  The simulation results are in good 
agreement with the experimental observation.  In addition, the predictions show that the tensile 
strength decreases with the increase of volume fraction of nanoparticles.  So far, no consistent 
experimental data can be found to validate the above results and thus further study in this issue is 
required. 
Introduction 
With the development of nanotechnology, the particles in nano-sizes have been utilized as 
reinforcement in nanocomposite.  Experimental observation revealed that the mechanical properties 
of the particulate nanocomposites are dependent on the particle size, particle dispersion, and particle 
volume fraction.  Cho et al. [1] performed tensile test on Vinyl ester based nanocomposites indicating 
that in the micro-scale, the tensile strength increases as the particle sizes decrease.  While, at 
nano-scales, because of the particle aggregation, the particle size effect is not apparent in their study.  
The similarly tendency that the strength of the nanocomposites increases as the particle size decreases 
can also be found in the literature [2, 3].  In addition to the size, the dispersion is another essential 
factor influencing the mechanical responses of the nanocomposites.  Fekete et al. revealed that as the 
particle size is less than a critical value, the severe particle aggregation would take place resulting in 
the reduction of the tensile strength [4].  In this study, the influence of particle size, volume fraction 
and particle aggregation on the tensile strength of the nanocomposites were investigated based on the 
linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) in conjunction with the finite element analysis.   
Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics  
In the theory of LEFM, stress intensity factor (SIF) and strain energy release rate (SERR) are the two 
parameters generally introduced in modeling the fracture behaviors of continuum solids.  Although 
the two quantities were developed based on different physical concepts (one is from the local 
stress/displacement filed, and the other is from energy variation), they can be adopted alternatively in 
predicting the onset of the crack embedded in a continuum solid.  In this study, the SERR, due to its 
simplicity in finite element analysis, was employed to measure the fracture behavior of the 
nanocomposites.  It is noted that in the following analysis, the nanocomposites was assumed to be a 
continuum solid and the nanoparticles as well as the surrounding matrix are linear elastic materials. 
The SERR basically defines the measurement of change in strain energy associated with an 
infinitesimal crack extension, and when it reaches a critical value, the crack begins to propagate.  
Irwin [5] proposed a crack closure integral to evaluate the SERR in a cracked solid.  By following the 
same concept, the SERR can also be evaluated using finite element analysis as [6, 7] 
 Fig. 3 demonstrates the particle size effect on the tensile strength of the nanocomposites.  The 
obtained values were normalized with respective to the strength in the pure matrix associated with the 
same crack length.  It can be seen that the model A is the critical case that the corresponding strength 
is much less than those obtained from the other two models.  As a result, when the crack is distributed 
randomly in the materials, the tensile strength of the nanocomposites would be dominated by the 
crack located vertically between two particles as denoted by model A.  Moreover, it is found that as 
the particle size increase, the failure stress decreases accordingly, which is quite coincided with the 
experimental observations [2, 3].

Effect of Particle Volume Fraction 
The influence of particle volume fraction on the tensile strength of nanocomposites is shown in Fig. 4.  
It is apparent that as the particle volume fraction increases, the normalized tensile strength for the 
model A (the critical case) is decreasing.  Therefore, the addition of the nanoparticle into 
nanocomposites may not enhance the tensile strength although the stiffness can be modified 
accordingly by the nanoparticles.

Effect of Particle Aggregation 
The particle aggregation is usually observed in the morphology of nanocomposites.  However, its 
effect on the tensile strength of nanocomposites was seldom explored before.  According to our 
earlier investigation, it is found the model A is the critical case in predicting the strength of 
particulate nanocomposites.  Therefore, model A was employed as an example to demonstrate the

efficiency of the reinforcement is increasing, and the 
overall mechanical properties of the nanocomposites 
can be enhanced accordingly.  When the effective 
length concept was extended into the DWCNTs, the 
effective length was calculated as

where    f1σ ,    f2σ  indicate the axial stress in layer 
1, and layer 2, respectively, and  sfσ  is the 
corresponding saturated stress of SWCNTs.  Figure 
3 illustrates the load transfer efficiency of SWCNTs 
and DWCNTs and DWCNTs with covalent bond.  It 
is apparent that the covalent bond can effectively 
improve the load transfer efficiency of DWCNTs.  
However as compared to the SWCNTs, the 
improvement is still less.  In addition, the increase of 
CNTs length basically can enhance the load transfer 
efficiency of CNTs nanocomposites. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The atomistic interaction of adjacent graphite layers 
in DWCNTs was characterized using MD simulation, 
based on which a spring element was introduced as 
the interface in the continuum DWCNTs model. 
Afterwards, the continuum DWCNTs was embedded 
in the matrix to form a continuum nanocomposites 
from which the load transfer efficiency were 
determined.  It was found that the load transfer 
efficiency increases with the increment of CNTs 
length.  In addition, the DWCNTs with covalent 
bonds exhibit superior load transfer efficiency than 
those with only vdW interactions.  In addition, the 
SWCNTs still possess the best load transfer 
efficiency as compared with DWCNTs even though 
there are covalent bonds in the DWCNTs.  Therefore, 
to achieve better mechanical properties, SWCNTs 
instead of DWCNTs are suggested as reinforcements 
in the nanocomposites.
