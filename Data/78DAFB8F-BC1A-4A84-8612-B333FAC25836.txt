miniaturize the short-range radar system as a highly 
integrated CMOS-based system of chips. This very 
recent development has opened up a large number of 
non-military applications that require active and 
wireless sensing, such as health-care monitoring, 
driver＇s physical condition monitoring, night-time 
security surveillance, survivor-finding in a 
disaster, etc. Still, a number of design challenges 
remain to be solved in order to make this new 
technology not just feasible but also attractive and 
cost-effective. 
In this project, we aim to focus on the research of a 
CMOS radar system of chips using ultra-wideband 
pulsed-radio that can be used for health-care 
monitoring – i.e., for monitoring the vital signs of 
health of a group of people (who could be elderly 
people, infants, patients, etc.) These vital signs of 
health include (1) breathing, (2) heartbeat, (3) gait 
of walking (which is useful for detecting if any of 
the subjects under monitoring takes a fall), etc. The 
system to be built will outperform previous works in 
many aspects. For example, it will be more process 
resilient so that it will be suitable for advanced 
nanometer process technologies. Also, it will be 
highly miniaturized and scalable so that one could 
eventually build a high-resolution array radar system 
taking it as a basic building block. Furthermore, it 
will be more power efficient to be fitted in a 
portable device while achieving a high resolution of 
detection at the same time.

Abstract 
  
A UWB impulse radio (IR) timed-array 
radar using time-shifted direct-sampling 
architecture is presented. The transmitter array 
can generate and send a variety of 10GS/s 
pulses towards targets. The receiver array 
samples the reflected signal in RF domain 
directly by time interleaved sampling with 
equivalent sampling rate of 20GS/s. The radar 
system can determine time of arrival (TOA) 
and direction of arrival (DOA) through 
time-shifted sampling edges which are 
generated by on-chip digital-to-time converters 
(DTC). The proposed architecture has range 
and azimuth resolution of 0.75 cm and 3 degree 
respectively. This prototype is implemented in

英文摘要 
Multi-phase clock generation (MPCG) is a 
problem that aims to generate a sequence of 
clock signals with the same frequency and 
uniformly shifted phases. In this paper we 
present a cell-based MPCG design with two 
technical merits: (1) we use a process calibration 
scheme that makes the per-phase delay (defined 
as the timing difference between two 
consecutive clock signals) highly accurate. (2) 
We further exploit a so-called cyclic property to 
make the achievable per-phase delay much 
smaller than a buffer delay. A design with 16-
phase clock signal (with the per-phase delay of 
only 100ps) is used to demonstrate its 
effectiveness. 
 
關鍵詞— Clock Generation, Multi-phase Clock, 
Process Resilient, Cyclic Property 
I. 前言 
A sequence of multi-phase clock signals is often 
needed in a timing control unit to support multiple 
sampling operation used in numerous applications, 
such as the high-speed serial data-link, LCD 
controller, the timing controller for pulse-based 
radars, etc. Conventional multi-phase clock 
generator (MPCG) is composed of delay-locked 
loops (DLL) [2]-[5], or voltage control oscillator 
(VCO) [6]-[9]. However, the multiphase signals in 
those conventional MPCG could be susceptible to 
the process variation that leads to larger phase 
errors. In this work, we aim to develop a cell-based 
calibration methodology to alleviate this problem.  
Traditionally, an MPCG (multi-phase clock 
generation) design can be realized by an 
architecture shown in Fig. 1. We assume that there 
are four phases of clock signals to be generated in 
this example. It incorporates four identical Tunable 
Delay Elements (TDE) with the same digital tuning 
code. As a consequence, their delays are all the 
same hypothetically. Through a search process 
conducted by the controller, a proper delay of the 
four TDEs jointly will be found to make the final 
output signal  in line with the original clock 
signal 0. When this property holds true, it follows 
that the output signals of the four TDEs, namely 
{1, 2, 3, 4} form a sequence of clock signals 
with equally shifted timing intervals at their rising 
edges.

(Definition 3): Two clock signals, say {x, y}, are 
denoted by x≡y, if their phases are the same. 
Sometimes, we also depict that these two signals 
are in-phase or edge-aligned, and use these 
phrases interchangeably.  
 
(Cyclic Property of a Clock Signal’s Phase): In 
general, a phase is a concept similar to the time 
delay except that the phase is cyclic. That is, for a 
phase larger than a reference period, say T, we can 
modulo T to derive its equivalent phase:  
 
    Equivalent-Phase = Original_Phase  %  T 
 
This property is based on an observation that, the 
waveform of a clock signal with a phase of “p” and 
the waveform of a clock signal with a phase of “p 
plus a number of clock periods” do not have any 
difference in their waveforms. By applying the 
above modulo operation, we can confine the phase 
of a clock signal to [0, T].

(Definition 4): We define the Phasor Plot of a 
MPCG problem, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The N 
phases of clock signals are mapped to their 
positions on a unit circle evenly: 
    Angle(i) = i * (360 / N) 
This phasor plot can describe the cyclic property in 
a more illustrative way. For example, a clock 
signal, say N+1, with a phase of notch, is a 
clock signal with an equivalent phase of notch. It 
thus implies that it is also in-phase with 1. 
III. 研究方法 
 
A. Basic Cyclic MPCG Architecture 
Fig. 4 reveals the architecture of a cyclic MPCG 
design. For simplicity, we assume that there are 16 
phases of clock signals to be produced and the per-
phase delay,notch, is 100ps. The clock period, T, of 
the clock signals are all 100ps * 16 = 1600ps, while 
the clock frequency is roughly 625MHz. At the 
first glance, this requirement is almost unattainable 
for a 0.18um CMOS process technology in that we 
cannot make a TDE (Tunable Delay Element) with 
the delay as small as 100ps. But as will be shown 
later, it could be easily achievable by taking 
advantage of the cyclic property discussed 
previously.  
 
(Basic Idea): Any TDE with the delay of (k*T + 
100ps) will produce desired MPCG output signals. 
Here, k is zero or any positive integer.

its phasor plot. 
 
In Fig. 4, we show an example of using k = 1, in 
which the desired delay across each TDE is 
(1*1600 + 100) = 1700ps. On the phasor plot as 
shown in Fig. 4(b), the clock signal produced by 
子計畫二 - 5 
 
two stages – first, we relax the stringent 
requirement of the TDE, and next, we find a way to 
control each of them separately but precisely. 
A. Process-Resilient Architecture 
Fig. 7 depicts the architecture of a cyclic MPCG 
design that can adapt to the true silicon speed of a 
manufactured chip and make the delay of each 
TDE equal as much as possible. In addition to the 
original chain of TDEs, the distinctive feature 
added is the incorporation of an All-Digital Phase-
Locked Loop (ADPLL), responsible for generating 
the calibration clock signals. The following 
paragraph describes our basic idea: 
Unlike the traditional MPCG design, we need to 
precisely control the edge position of not just the 
final phase of clock signal, 16, but also every 
internal phase of clock signal, i.e., {1, 2, …, 16}. 
This may seem quite challenging originally, but 
now it has become feasible since the delay of each 
TDE has been much longer after we have applied 
the cyclic property. In practice, this can be done by 
simply adjusting the frequency (or the clock period 
in other words) of the input clock signal 0. For 
example, if we adjust the clock period in our 
working example from the original 1600ps to 
1700ps, then the goal of process calibration is to 
make all phases of clock signals in-phase with 0 in 
our cyclic MPCG design. If this criterion is 
achieved, then we will have successfully placed the 
edge position of each phase of clock signal at its 
right timing location within a very small error 
range roughly determined by the tuning resolution 
of a TDE.

Fig. 7: Modified MPCG architecture supporting 
process calibration. 
 
The modified architecture operates in two 
different modes – (1) the process calibration mode 
after power up, and followed by (2) functional 
mode. These two operational modes accept a 
reference clock signal of different frequencies (or 
clock periods). In our working example, the clock 
period is 1700ps in the calibration mode, while 
1600ps in the functional mode. These two 
requirements can be integrated as an ADPLL, 
explained below: 
 The input is an external clock signal, 
denoted as ref, with the functional clock 
period (e.g., 1600ps in our example). 
 There is a frequency divider (as a pre-scaler) 
that divides the frequency of ref by (N+1) in 
the calibration mode, and N in the 
functional mode. In terms of clock period, 
this is equivalent to stretching ref by (N+1) 
or N times, producing a clock signal called 
pre-scaled. 
 The basic function of the ADPLL is to 
multiply the frequency of clock signal pre-
scaled by a multiplicative factor equaling the 
number of phases, N, and N=16 in our 
example. In terms of clock period, pre-scaled 
is shrunk by N times when producing clock 
signal 0. 
The final clock period of 0 can be calculated as 
follows: (1) In the calibration mode, Period(0) = 
(1/N) * Period(pre-scaled) = (1/N) * (N+1) * 
Period(ref) = (N+1)/N * Period(ref). In our 
example, this corresponds to Period(0) = 17/16 * 
1600ps = 1700ps, or one notch larger than the 
target clock period. (2) In the functional mode, 
Period(0) = (1/N) * Period(pre-scaled) = (1/N) * (N) 
* Period(ref) = Period(ref). In our example, this 
corresponds to Period(0) = 1600ps, which is 
simply the target clock period. 
 It is worth mentioning that ADPLL has been a 
mature design target with numerous related papers. 
In this work, we use an ADPLL compiler which 
can automatically realize a desired ADPLL with 
only standard cells [17].

TDE increases and/or decreases based on whether 
16 is leading or lagging 0, in a way similar to a 
thermometer. The following is the more detailed

1. Initially, the tuning codes of the TDEs are set 
to their calibrated values, denoted as <c1, 
c2, …, c16>. 
2. We set the first TDE as the designated TDE. 
3. An iterative process begins. At each iteration, 
we assume that the index of the designated 
TDE is i. If the phase comparator finds that 
16 is leading 0, then it implies that the 
overall delay of the TDEs is too small, and 
thus we will increment the tuning code of the 
designated TDE by 1, and then move the 
designated TDE to the right by updating i = i 
+ 1. Similarly, if the phase comparator finds 
that 16 is lagging 0, then it implies that the 
overall delay of the TDEs is too large, and 
thus we will move the designated TDE to the 
left by updating i = i – 1 before decrement the 
tuning code of the new designated TDE. 
When we move the index of the designated 
TDE, both ends will form a loop. For example, 
when i is 16 and we move it to the right, then 
it will be reset to 1. Similarly, if i is already 1 
and we move it to the left, then it will be reset 
to 16.  
In some sense, the designated TDE represents a 
border line in our procedure. The TDEs to the left 
of it have larger delay relatively, while those TDEs 
to the right of it have less delay relatively. The 
principle we wish to maintain is to pick a TDE 
with less delay to make contribution when we need 
to increase the overall delay across the TDE chain. 
On the contrary, we pick a TDE with larger delay 
to sacrifice when we need to decrease the overall 
delay. 
V. 實驗結果 
The proposed cell-based cyclic MPCG is 
implemented by following the general cell-based 
design flow with the TSMC 0.18μm CMOS 
technology. We use IC-Compiler from Synopsys as 
our automatic place and routing (APR) tool. The 
layout of the chip is demonstrated in Fig. 10. 
 
Fig. 10: The layout of our target 16-phase design. 
 
There are several important quality metrics when 
designing an MPCG circuit - most notably the 
minimum achievable per-phase delay, the 
maximum clock frequency, and phase error (i.e., 
the timing deviation from the ideal phase positions). 
Next, we will compare ours with the some previous 
design in the literature from an analytical point of 
view first, and then provide some post-layout 
simulation results. 
(1) Minimum achievable per-phase delay: In some 
sense, this metric represents the timing resolution 
of a MPCG design. The smaller it is, the better the 
quality. For the traditional architecture, this will 
correspond to the minimum delay across a buffer 
under the selected process technology. As for our 
design, this is much smaller – as it corresponds to 
the tuning resolution of a TDE. 
(2)  Maximum clock frequency: The traditional 
MPCG design usually can support a very high 
clock frequency since it consists of only a delay

Fig. 14: The timing errors of the 4 phases of clock 
signals. 
 
Fig. 11 shows the post-layout simulated 
waveforms by NanoSim. Fig. 12 shows the 
waveforms of the 16 phases of clock signals before 
and after the process calibration. It can be seen that 
the rising edges are all precisely aligned after the 
process calibration as expected. Since we do not 
aim to preserve the duty cycles, the falling edges 
are left unaligned unharmfully. The phase errors of 
the 16 phases of the clock signals {1, 2, …, 16} 
are also profiled in Fig. 13. It shows that the phase 
error can be as high as 188ps without the process 
calibration due to the variation of the wire lengths, 
while reduced to less than 13ps after applying the 
proposed calibration scheme. Fig. 14 shows the 
phase errors of another 4-phase clock generator 
design. With the process calibration, the maximum 
phase error can be reduced from 45ps to 11ps for a 
0.18μm process, and 27ps to 4ps for a 90nm 
process. 
Table 3 shows the performance comparison with 
some previous works. Since our design can be 
easily portable to any cell library ready process, we 
designed three versions for comparison: (1) a 4-
phase MPCG using a 0.18um process, (2) a 4-
phase MPCG using a 90nm process, and (3) a 16-
phase MPCG for our in-house radar IC using a 
0.18um process.  
It shows that, ours is still quite competitive in 
the achievable minimum per-phase delay even 
though it is made of standard cells. As for area, 
ours is much smaller. The listed first two works, 
i.e., [10] and [11], are 5.6X and 35X larger than 
ours, respectively, after area normalization. In a 
head-to-head comparison with the work in [11], we 
are only inferior in the phase error (e.g., our 11ps 
versus their 3.5ps). This is mostly due to the 
limitation imposed by the cell-based phase detector. 
If smaller phase error is required, then we can 
resort to one of the following two solutions – (1) 
we can fully customize a 1ps-precision phase 
detector [18] as a new cell and add it to the 
standard cell library to improve the accuracy, or (2) 
we can simply use a more advanced process, if that 
is available. For example, the phase error in our 
design can be reduced from 11ps to only 4ps after 
shifting from a 0.18um process to a 90nm process. 
The power consumptions of our 4-phase clock 
generator design are 22.9mW for 0.18um process 
and 3.4mW for 90nm process, respectively. In 
terms of power consumption, the work in [11] is 
81/22.9=3.53X of ours. It is also notable that the 
work of [10] consumes only 18mW. This is partly 
due to its low operating frequency at 150MHz. 
After scaled by the supply voltage factor (1.82/3.3)2 
and the clock frequency factor 
(2000MHz/150MHz), the power consumption of 
[10] will translate to roughly 71mW, which is still 
(71/22.9) = 3.1X of our version in the 0.18um 
process.

討論 
When it comes to the design of a multi-phase 
clock generation (MPCG), the selected process 
technology may impose some limitations that do 
not seem to be reconcilable by standard cells – e.g., 
the amount of small delays one wish to control 
precisely across a delay cell. One may choose to 
use more pricy and advanced processes to alleviate 
this problem, but then the process variation may 
rear its ugly head and some process calibration is 
still needed. We make contribution in this work

recognition become important. Many researches 
have been proposed for human posture and ac-
tion recognition. However, most of the pro-
posed approaches have high computational 
complexity. In this paper, we propose a low-cost 
real-time action recognition approach using on-
ly five center of gravity points (COG) and four 
feature sets. Two feature sets measure the dis-
placement of the upper and lower body COG in 
the vertical and horizontal directions. The other 
two feature sets quantize the upper and lower 
body angular change rate. With these feature 
sets and a classification model, our proposed 
approach is able to recognize five different stat-
ic postures including stand, laying, bend, sit and 
squat and two actions, walking and handwaving. 
The simulation results show that our proposed 
approach achieve 98.02% to 80.20% recogni-
tion rates for various postures and actions in the 
KTH and ISIR databases. Our approach can 
achieve real-time recognition for video se-
quence and has lower computational complexity 
than other state-of-art algorithms. 
四、方法討論 
A LOW COST AND REAL-TIME HUMAN 
POSTURE RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
In order to reduce the computational complexity, 
we propose a centroid context based posture 
and action recognition approach using only five 
center of gravity points (COG) and four feature 
sets. Two feature sets measure the displacement 
of the upper and lower body COG in the vertic-
al and horizontal directions. For example, Fig. 1 
shows the variation of vertical height at five dif-
ferent postures. When a human being is in the 
stand posture, the vertical height value is the 
highest and the values of vertical height de-
crease in the other postures. The other two fea-
ture sets quantize the upper and lower body an-
gular change rate. For example, Fig. 2 shows 
the process of handwaving. When a person has 
the handwaving action, the upper body angular 
changes constantly. Fig. 3 shows the process of 
the walking action.  
 
When a human being is in the walking action, 
the lower body angular changes constantly. 
With the feature sets and a classification model, 
our proposed approach is able to recognize five 
different static postures including stand, laying, 
bend, sit and squat and two actions, walking 
and handwaving. The proposed human posture 
recognition system flowchart is shown in Fig. 4. 
At first, we use the background subtraction al-
  子計畫五 - 4
 
(B) Definition of the Feature Ratio 
In this subsection, we extract three feature ra-
tios R1, R2 and R3 respectively. At first, we use 
COG଴, COGଵ, and COGଶ to construct an upper 
triangle then use COGo, COG3, and COGସ to 
construct a lower triangle. From these two tri-
angles, we define three values Wଵ, Wଶ, and H 
as follows. 
 
The Wଵ is the horizontal distance of the COGଵ 
and COGଶ, and Wଶ is the horizontal distance 
of the COGଷ and COGସ. The H is the Eucli-
dean distance between the midpoint of COGଵ 
and COGଶ  and the midpoint of COGଷ  and 
COGସ. According to these values, we define the 
three feature ratios Rଵ, Rଶ, Rଷ, as below. 
 
Rଵ is used to distinguish postures including the 
stand, sit, squat and laying. Rଷ is used to iden-
tify the bend posture. Fig. 6 shows an example 
of the body feature values definition. Fig. 7 
shows the postures distribution of different R1 
and Rଷ values and it shows that the stand, sit, 
squat, laying and bending can be differentiated 
from these two values. 
 
 
 
(C) Definition of the Angle Feature 
In this subsection, we present angle features to 
distinguish action postures of handwaving and 
walking. The upper COGଵ  and COGଶ  change 
positions for a human handwaving action. For a 
walking action, the lower COGଷ  and COGସ 
change positions. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 shows the 
process of handwaving and walking. Here we 
define two angle features Aଵ and Aଶ based on 
the law of cosines as below. We can find Aଵ 
and Aଶ as shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 
  子計畫五 - 6
When the stand posture have the highest Rଵ 
value and the Rଵ value changes depending on 
postures. At first, we perform a recognition step 
for a static stand posture. If this stand posture 
persists static with TR seconds that Tୖ  is 3 
here, then we compute the current R1 value for 
the stand position. Based on the computed Rଵ 
value, we can define stand threshold Tୗ as fol-
lows. 
 
A human body has very large Wଵ  and Wଶ 
values and a small H value at the laying posture 
as shown in Fig. 1(e). We assign the laying 
posture threshold T୐ is 0.5. Then we define an 
equation to calculate a threshold Tୗୗto distin-
guish the sit and squat postures as follows. 
 
However, it is not robust enough to use only the 
Rଵ feature to distinguish the sit and squat post-
ures since these two postures could have similar 
Rଵ. According to the features of these two post-
ures, we use the Rଷ feature to distinguish these 
two postures. In this paper, we assign the squat 
threshold Tୗ୕ as 0.8. In order to distinguish the 
bend posture, we use the Rଷ feature. The rea-
son of using the Rଷ feature is beacuse the up-
per Wଵ is larger than Wଶ in the bend posture. 
Based on this feature, we assign the bend thre-
shold T୆  is ଷଶ. We adopt these features and 
thresholds to model the recognition flow. 
(B) Recognition Flow 
The recognition flow is shown in Fig .10. The 
input is a 30 fps video and the frame size is 
484-by-272 in our proposed system. We com-
pute these features every 15 frames such that 
it computes the features two times in one 
second. At the beginning, the posture is in the 
undetermined state until the first stand posture 
is recognized. After that, it enters the motion 
flow if the COG଴ changes over T୑ frame in 
past T୑  seconds. Otherwise, it enters to the 
  子計畫五 - 8
 
body is almost static in the half of past 10 frame. 
The experiment results are shown as in Fig. 
11(g). If the postures are not walking and 
handwaving then we call this is at transition 
state. 
五、實驗結果 
To show the benefits of the proposed approach, 
we perform experiments on publicly available 
databases for posture recognition to demon-
strate the efficiency of the proposed 
classification algorithm and to validate the 
claims of previous sections. The computational 
complexity of the proposed approach and two 
other methods are also analyzed in this section. 
We evaluate our approach on the KTH database 
[7] and ISIR database [10]. We also adopt Hsieh 
et al [6]’s approach for comparison and this test 
includes 270 video sequences of 6 different 
postures.  
A. KTH Database 
The KTH human action dataset, originally 
created by [7], consists of 600 videos (160 120) 
with 25 persons performing human action in 
four different scenarios: outdoors s1, outdoors 
with scale variation s2, outdoors with different 
clothes s3, and indoors s4. Due to the back-
ground limitation, we perform the experiments 
for the walking sequence here. Illustrative ex-
amples for walking actions are shown in Fig. 12 
and the result is shown in Fig. 13. From the re-
sults presented in Fig. 13, it shows that the pro-
posed method can recognize most walking se-
quences and a recognition rate of 96% is ob-
tained. 
B. ISIR Database 
A sequence database comprising eight actions is 
considered: crouch down, stand up, sit down, sit 
up, walk, bend down, get up from bending, and 
jump. Various viewpoints are acquired for each 
action. The face, 45°and 90°views are captured 
while others are synthesized from the recorded 
sequences already by symmetry. Due the re-
striction of background subtraction, we use the  
  子計畫五 - 10
and Tୗୗ value and T୐ value as 2.359 and 0.5 
respectively. The number of the test images of 
the sit posture is 112 and the correct recognized 
number is 102. The recognition rate is 91.07%. 
As for the bend posture, the T୆ threshold is 
assigned as 1.5. The number of the test images 
of the bend posture is 126 and the correct rec-
ognized number is 101. The recognition rate is 
80.20%. The recognition rate results are shown 
in Fig. 15. 
The experimental results show that our pro-
posed method has good recognition rate at squat 
and sit postures. For the bend postures, we have 
lower recognition rate because the direction of 
bend is face to the camera. 
C. Our Database with other methods 
We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate 
the movement sequence recognition using the 
proposed model-based feature approach. We 
collect 270 movement that contains divided six 
action types and each action type has 45 se-
quences.The experimental results, listed in Ta-
ble I, show that most of the test sequences are
