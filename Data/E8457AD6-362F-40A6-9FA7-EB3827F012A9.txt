Abstract 
 
In this program, we theoretically calculate the carrier concentration difference 
in the low (~0V) and high field (~-40V) without the avalanche behavior. The 
electric field shows an important factor in the high gain characteristics in the 
pin photodiode. We also fabricate the gallium nitride pin photodiodes with and 
without low-temperature (LT) GaN interlayer to characterize the gain behavior 
in the pin structure. The LT i-GaN layer cause the high gain at a small electric 
field (~0.4 MV/cm) due to the carrier multiplication effect. The UV photocurrent 
gain of 13 and large ionization coefficient (α=3.1×105 cm-1) were also observed 
in the detector with LT-GaN interlayer. The LT i-GaN interlayer shows an 
effective method to increase the gain in the photodiode.

To study the photo current generated under illumination, we define a fine 
illumination area 100um x 5um with photon density 1x1018 cm-2s-1. The illumination 
position was changed as 15um (x1), 10um (x2) and 6um (x3) with (x0,y0)=(0um, 
0um) at the left corner. 
 
Results and Discussions 
Figure 2(a) and (b) shows the electron concentration and hole concentration at 
x-direction with position fixed at y0=3.5um (i.e. the center of i-GaN layer) and  bias 
-4V with different illumination positions (i.e. x1, x2 and x3). In the figure, although 
the less electron and hole concentrations can be observed at x=x1, the difference is 
small (~10%). Besides, the hole shows a broaden distribution.   
Figure 3 shows the electron and hole distribution at y-direction with x at the 
illumination center with device biased at -4V. Minor difference can be observed in the 
concentration distribution in the figure. 
With higher reverse bias, the electron and hole concentration difference can be 
observed. Figure 4 shows the electron and hole concentration at y-direction at 
different bias with illumination at x2. With higher reverse bias, the electric field in the 
i-layer becomes large, electrons and holes are easily to be sweep out and thus less 
carriers can be found in the i-layer. With bias increase from 0V to 40V, the carrier 
concentration difference around one decade can be observed in the figure. 
Thus, from the calculation, the carrier difference in the i-layer at -40V bias is 
around one decade less compared to 0V. With higher reverse bias, the carrier 
concentration in the i-layer is less with the assumption that there is no avalanche 
behavior. For real device, higher photo current can be observed with high reverse bias. 
contact was deposited onto the exposed n-type GaN layer to serve as the n-electrode. 
The wafers were then lapped down to 100μm and fabricated to the size of 325 × 325 
μm2 chips.  
Figure 5 shows measured photocurrent under xenon light source illumination at 
room temperature. It can be seen that the photocurrent increased largely after 20 V 
reverse bias at the sample with LT-GaN interlayer. The increase of photocurrent also 
shows an internal current gain in sample B. In contrast, the photocurrent of sample A 
was almost flat in the whole measurement range as shown in Fig. 5. The inset of Fig. 
5 shows the dark currents of the two fabricated photodiodes measured at room 
temperature. The dark currents of sample A at 5 V and 40 V reverse bias are 15.7 pA 
and 36.6 nA, respectively while the dark currents of sample B at 5 V and 40 V reverse 
bias are 143 pA and 147 nA, respectively. The slight increase of dark current in 
sample B may be attributed to the leakage paths formed from LT-GaN interlayer. It 
also can be seen that the reverse break-down voltage of both samples is more than 40 
V. Thus, the current gain in sample B can not be attributed to avalanche multiplication 
effect.  
Figure 6 shows the UV photoresponse to excitation with 360 nm light and dark 
current of sample B. The current gain was also shown in the right axis of Fig. 6 and 
determined by using the photocurrent at a bias of 1 V as the unity gain reference point. 
It was found that the current gain occurred at 20 V reverse bias and reached a value of 
13 at 40 V reverse bias (limited by measurement equipment). It is known that current 
gain can be obtained through the avalanche multiplication effect in avalanche 
photodiodes. The avalanche multiplication not only depends on the high electric field, 
but also the overall spatial distance. An electric field around 3.5 and 2.8 MV/cm 
across the transition region with i-layer thickness 100 and 300 nm is necessary for 
exactly the LT-GaN interlayer, i.e., L=30nm. Thus, the ionization coefficient which 
can be calculated from the above equation is 3.1×105 cm-1. This value of ionization 
coefficient is larger than that in other reported photodiodes by Carrano et al.2 
(α=9.6×104 cm-1) and Limb et al.3 (α=3.3×104 cm-1). The larger ionization coefficient 
could be attributed to the large multiplication carrier generated from the 
defect-trapped levels in the LT-GaN interlayer. In Fig. 6, we also observed the soft 
ionization at a small reverse bias (<20V) and the saturation trend at high reverse bias. 
The soft ionization may be due to the trap-assisted tunneling mechanism by the 
defect-trapped levels in the LT-GaN interlayer.4 The saturation trend in ionization 
coefficient shows multiplication carrier generated from the intermediate energy states, 
not from the valence band.5 
Figure 8 shows the responsivities of sample A and sample B, which are measured 
at 360 nm wavelength. A typical responsivity of a GaN p-i-n photodiode varied with 
voltages was observed in sample A. The responsivity increased slightly with 
increasing applied voltage. The 360 nm wavelength responsivities of the sample A at 
0 and 40 V reverse bias are 0.18 and 0.24 A/W, respectively. The slight decrease of 
reponsivity in sample A at high reverse bias (>35V) could be attributed to the high 
dark current increasing. In contrast, the responsivity of sample B increased largely 
with increasing applied voltage because of the carrier multiplication effect. The 360 
nm wavelength responsivities of sample B at 0 and 40 V reverse bias are 0.16 and 
2.27 A/W, respectively. In Fig. 8, it was also found that the peak responsivity (360 nm) 
of sample B was smaller than that of sample A at a reverse bias of less than 25 V. This 
may be due to that the photogenerated carriers were compensated by the defect levels 
of LT-GaN interlayer in sample B. On the other hand, the responsivity of sample B 
was much larger than that of sample A when the applied bias was higher than 25 V 
combination is quite well to explain the experiment results. Some results are 
summarized and published in time.
