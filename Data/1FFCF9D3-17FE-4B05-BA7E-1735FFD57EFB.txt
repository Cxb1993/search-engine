1. Introduction 
Although a portable and light OLED display has great 
competition in the future,  however, how to prevent the 
moisture attack is a key issue for the device with a long 
lifetime [1]. Compared with the conventional glass-sealed 
package technique, it gets more attractive by using the 
dielectric/organic mixed multi layers as the passivation 
barrier. For the choice of the dielectric layers, the silicon 
nitride or the silicon oxide layers are widely used[2,3]. In 
this work, we proposed that the carbon-coated silicon 
oxide films might be used as the effective passivation 
layers. The silicon oxide films were deposited onto the 
plastic substrate by the electron-gun evaporation and then 
treated in a RIE chamber by injecting the CH4 plasma. The 
water vapor transmission rate was measured and discussed 
in detail.  
 
2. Experiment and Results 
In this study, the SiOx films were all deposited onto the 
0.2mm-thick PET substrates by using the electron-gun evaporation. 
The deposition rate was controlled at 2nm/sec. After the silicon 
oxide deposition process, the samples were then treated in a RIE 
chamber by injecting the CH4 gas driving with a low power of 
50W. In addition, the effect of other reactant gas such as oxygen or 
hydrogen was also incorporated and discussed. For the testing of 
the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), the sample was 
tightly sealed over a glass bottle filled with the CaCl2 (2g) by 
using the UV glue and then put into an controlled 
environment of 60oC and 95% relative humidity(RH). 
Typically, the weight gain as a function of time was 
recorded. 
Fig.1 shows the typical weight gain as a function of 
time at various RIE treating time. Fig.2 shows the 
corresponding water vapor transmission rate as a function 
of time. From Fig.2, it was found that the minimum WVTR 
value was obtained as low as 11.9 g/day/cm2 at the 
processing time of 4 minutes, which is 8 times lower than 
the untreated silicon oxide films as shown in Fig.3. It is 
easily found that the average WVTR value of various 
silicon o xide films was about 90 g/day/cm2 which is similar 
to that of the PET substrate (95 g/day/cm2). The reason can 
be explained when we performed the contact angle of water 
drops measurement. Fig.4 shows the contact angle of water 
drops on (a) the PET substrate and on (b) the silicon oxide 
films. The contact angles were 94o and 19o for the PET and 
the silicon oxide films, respectively. If the CH4 plasma 
treatment was further performed on the silicon oxide films, 
the contact angle of water drops increase up to 77o as 
shown in Fig.4(c). However, it is worth to point out that the 
surface roughness were 0.34 nm and 0.52 nm for the 
untreated SiOx films and after the CH4 plasma treatment, 
respectively. It can be concluded that the most important 
key issue was not depended on the surface morphology; the 
surface dangle bonds or surface states play the important 
roles.  
Fig.5 shows the AES depth profile of the CH4 plasma 
treated silicon oxide films. After the RIE treatment of CH4 
plasma, the carbon was obviously coated on top of the SiOx 
films and the contact angle of water drops shows a 
significant increase up to 77o as shown in Fig.4(c). From 
the interface between the carbon and silicon oxide layer, the 
silicon and oxygen atoms seem to slightly out diffuse into 
the carbon layer during the CH4 plasma treatment. 
Therefore, in order to pre-compensate the dangling bonds 
on the surface of the silicon oxide layers, the treatment 
using hydrogen plasma was carried out before the CH4 
plasma treatment. In order to avoid the etching process 
during the H2 plasma treatment, the treating time is short 
and the power is also kept at a low value. Fig.5(b) indicates 
that the AES depth profile shows almost no diffusion 
phenomenon between the interface of the carbon and the 
silicon oxide layer. The WVTR values (5~6 g/day/cm2) 
were about two times lower than the minimum value (11.9 
g/day/cm2) of pure CH4 RIE treatment as shown in Fig.6.    
 
3. Conclusions  
In summary, the silicon oxide films were successfully 
deposited on the PET substrates, and then the samples were 
treated in the CH4 plasma. It was found that the WVTR 
values of the SiOx films were almost the same as that of the 
PET substrate due to the contact angle of water drops was 
obtained as low as 19o on top of the SiOx films. However, 
after the CH4 plasma treatment, the contact angle of water 
drops shows a significant increase up to 77o. This
