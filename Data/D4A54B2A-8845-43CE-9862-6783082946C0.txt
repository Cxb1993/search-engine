摘要 
   我們研究了PVPH-b-PS分別和P4VP, PMMA, PVPH以不同氫鍵強度鍵結的相行為，
FT-IR結果顯示 PVPH-b-PS/P4VP的混摻具有較多比例的 PVPH氫鍵鍵結，和
PMMA/PVPH混摻相比具有明顯較高的互溶性。PVPH-b-PS/P4VP混摻具一系列相轉
變，從lamellar、gyroid、hexagonally packed、cylinder到body-centered cubic結構(當P4VP
的體積比例從6%增加到71%)。而PVPH-b-PS/PMMA和PVPH-b-PS/PMMA混摻添加一樣
比例的Homopolymer，卻僅僅是lamellar的結構。此外，由於氫鍵作用力的關係，在添加
到高比例時，lamellar的結構會隨者添加的比例增加有不同程度的破壞。基於以上的結
果，我們引入了一個參數 (KA/KB)(KA = interassociation equilibrium constant，KB = 
self-association equilibrium constant)判斷於氫鍵作用力情形下Homopolymer混摻diblock 
copolymer之相行為:當KA/KB >> 1，系統會趨向是diblock copolymer；當KA/KB << 1，隨
homopolymer體積分率的增加，可以預期相分離會取代規則的相變化。

Experimental Section 
Block copolymer and homopolymer syntheses.   
The PVPh-b-PS diblock copolymer and the PVPh, P4VP, and PMMA homopolymers were 
synthesized through sequential anionic polymerization as described in the Supporting Information; 
their molecular weights are 2summarized in Table 1.49-53  
 
Table 1. Molecular weights of PVPh-b-PS, PVPh, PMMA, and P4VP used in preparing the 
polymer blends. The volume fractions of PVPh and PS blocks in the neat block copolymer are 
respectively 37.6 and 62.4%.

Sample Preparation.  
Blends of PVPh-b-PS/P4VP, PVPh-b-PS/PMMA, and PVPh-b-PS/PVPh (denoted as HS/V, 
HS/M, and HS/H, respectively), with a series of volume fractions of homopolymer up to 70 %, 
were prepared through solution casting. After stirring for 6–8 h, thin films specimens were cast 
on Teflon dishes from dimethylformamide (DMF) solutions containing 5 wt% polymer mixture, 
followed by a slow evaporation at 100 °C for 7 days and a subsequent thermal annealing at 120 
°C under vacuum for another 7 days. Samples thus prepared could be reproduced for the same 
thermal properties and same structures. 
 
Characterization Methodology.  
DSC traces were measured using a DuPont TA Instrument Q-20 controller at a scan rate of 20 
°C/min, over the temperature range from 30 to 250 °C under N2 . Infrared spectra were recorded 
with a resolution of 1 cm-1 using a Nicolet Avatar 320 FTIR spectrometer under N2; the 
vacuum-dried sample thin films, satisfying the Beer-Lambert law within the absorbance range, 
were cast directly onto KBr pellets from the DMF sample solutions. 
TEM images were taken for the samples with either the PS block stained with RuO4 or the 
P4VP block with I2, using a Hitachi H-7500 transmission electron microscope operated at an 
accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Ultrathin sections of the TEM samples (ca. 70 nm thickness) 
were prepared using a Leica Ultracut UCT microtome equipped with a diamond knife. SAXS

Here, n is the total number of diffraction orders observed (n >3 for a more reliable electron 
density profile), and qk, I(qk), and ϕk are respectively the scattering vector, integrated intensity, 
and phase factor, of the kth reflection. For a centrosymmetical system ϕk is either +1 or -1. It was 
found that for the polymer blend studied, the most reasonable combination for the phase factors 
of the first four lamellar peaks are (-1, +1, +1, -1); with the phase factors, the extracted electron 
densities for the mixed PVPh-P4VP, PVPh-PMMA, and PVPh-PVPh layers are, as expected, 
higher than that of the PS layer.   
 
Results and Discussion 
FTIR result 
As shown in Figure 1a,b are the two IR spectra for the HS/V and HS/M blends. Figure 1c 
displays the corresponding fb profiles deduced from the IR spectra, based mainly on the two 
chrematistic absorptions at 993 and 1005 cm-1 for the HS/V blends and 1730 and 1705 cm–1 for 
the HS/M blends, as detailed previously. The fb values for the HS/V system are systematically 
much higher than that of the HS/M system, reflecting a substantially better hydrogen bonding 
efficiency. This result is consistent with the much higher KA/KB value (~16) (for the ratio between 
inter- and self-association equilibrium constants derived based on the PCAM model55) of the 
HS/V blend system than that (KA/KB ~0.6) for the HS/M blend. IR spectra taken for the two 
systems in the range 2700-4000 cm-1 consistently reveal a much stronger hydrogen bonding 
strength for the HS/V system, as detailed in the Supporting Information. The deduced fb values 
(and their multiplies with the volume fractions for hydrogen-bounded volume fractions) serve as 
a guide for the order-order morphology transitions of the polymer blends, as detailed below.

Order-order structural transitions for the HS/V blends 
The TEM images shown in Figure 3 for the HS/V blends exhibited a series of order-order 
phase transitions from the lamellar, gyroid, hexagonally packed cylinder (HCP), to body-centered 
cubic (BCC) structures, as the volume fraction of P4VP increases from 6-13, 15-22, 29, to 71 %. 
Such phase transition behavior of the blend follows closely that for a neat diblock copolymer, 
implying a collective behavior of PVPh and P4VP chains in the mixed phase.

Order-disorder structural transitions for the HS/M and HS/H blends 
The HS/M and HS/H blending systems show respectively modest and low hydrogen 
bonding between homopolymer and copolymer, as compared to the HS/V blends. Consequently, 
TEM images (Figure 5 and 6) taken for the two systems show mainly the order-to-disorder 
(lamellar to distorted lamellar) structural change, when the volume fraction of the additive 
increased in the same range (6-70%) as that in HS/V system. At high volume fractions of 
additives, phase separation of the additive homopolymers was observed in especially the HS/H 
blends with weak hydrogen bonding. Before phase separation, an intermediate structure of 
swollen lamellae coexisting with the unswollen ones could be observed (Figure 5e and 6c,d) for 
both systems, as also evidenced from the broad double peaks in the corresponding SAXS profiles 
(indicated by the thick arrows in Figure 7a and 7b). Especially for in the HS/H blends, TEM 
image (Figure 6e) indicates that the large amount of homopolymer finally discrete the lamellae of 
the diblock copolymer into single slabs (single bilayers); previously, the DSC result has also 
suggested a dissociation of the mixed phase based on the diminishing Tg (Figure 2c). Likely, upon 
loosing the steric interactions between the lamellar slabs, the dangling slabs bent and curve in the 
excess homopolymer phase; the formation of hollow tubes with single-bilayer wall as shown in 
Figure 6e, however, is a surprising.

(e) HS/M = 30/70. Cartoons in the insets present the corresponding structures proposed.

Figure 7. SAXS intensity profiles measured for the (a) HS/M and (b) HS/H blends, with the 
respective compositions indicated. The lamellar reflections are marked by the thin 
arrows, whereas the scattering humps from the form factor of slabs are marked with 
circled numbers in (b). The thick arrows nearby the first lamellar peaks indicate the 
coexisting of two types of lamellae. In (a) and (b) the two dotted lines across all the 
SAXS profiles for the HS/V and HS/M blends illustrate the opposite shifting 
directions of the first peak position.    
 
 To illustrate the reliability of the prescribed volume fractions for the mixed phase in 
these blends, we note that in the SAXS profile of the neat HS containing ~40 vol. % PVPh, the 
5th reflection (Figure 7a) nearly diminishes as it should be, owing to a destructive interference 
under this volume fraction; upon the addition of 21% PMMA into the blend for equal volume 
fractions of the PS and PVPh-PMMA phases (i.e. the 79:21 case in Figure 7a), lamellar peaks of 
even orders of destructive phase factors disappear accordingly. Interestingly, the two sets of 
SAXS profiles of the HS/M and HS/H blends illustrate opposite shifting of the first peak position; 
namely, the first peak in the HS/M blend shifts systematically towards higher-q region as the 
PMMA content increases, corresponding a shrinkage of the lamellar spacing. In the case of HS/H 
blends, the first lamellar peak shifts toward lower q upon increasing the PVPh content, 
corresponding to an increase of the lamellar spacing. The origin of this dissimilarity is discussed 
below based on the hydrogen bonding (attractive interactions) of the additive homopolymers with 
the copolymer.

blends. Furthermore, based on the Painter–Coleman association model (PCAM) and the 
inter-association equilibrium constant KA and self-association equilibrium constants KB, we 
suggest the simple ratio KA/KB can also be used as a convenient guide in estimating the phase 
behavior of similar polymer blends. The KA and KB values for the hydrogen-bonded PVPh/P4VP 
(KA = 598) and PVPh/PMMA (KA = 37.4) and the self-association equilibrium constant for PVPh 
(KB = 66.8) have been determined previously.50,55,59 Based on these values, the phase behavior the 
HS/V blends with KA/KB ~ 9 (>>1) of strong hydrogen bonding strength follows closely that of a 
typical diblock copolymer; with KA/KB ~0.6 for the HS/M blends, phase separation instead of 
order-order transition is observed above certain volume fraction of homopolymer, as that 
illustrated in Figure 9. 
 
 
Figure 9. Schematic representation of an A-b-B/C blend system featuring in hydrogen bonding 
interactions. Note that the molar weight of the homopolymer should be comparable or smaller 
than that of the hydrogen-bonding associated block of the copolymer. 
 
 
Distribution/chain conformation of the additive homopolymers in the blends 
As we have clarified the hydrogen bonding effect on the phase behavior of the A-b-B/C 
type of polymer blends based on PS-b-PVPh, with P4VP, PMMA, and PVPh additives, we are 
now in a good position to examine how additive homopolymers conform and distribute their 
chains in the blends to fulfill the different structural characteristics required for the different 
ordered phases observed.  
 Summarizes in Table 2 are the thicknesses of the PS layer, DPS,, the mixed layer (of 
PVPh-homopolymer), Dmix, and the long period D, of all the blends of lamellar morphology,

in addition, the transition zone thickness Dtr can be defined from the electron density profile as 
illustrated in Figure 11a. 
 Shown in Figure 11c are the Dtr values obtained for the three kinds of blends. The obvious 
increase of Dtr from 5.0 to 6.3 nm with the increase of the additive volume fraction up to 10 % for 
the HS/H blends, implies significantly disturbed interfaces by the homopolymer. Rather than 
interdiffusion of PS and PVPh chains at the interface, we attribute the increased Dtr to the 
undulation of lamellar thickness induced by an irregular distribution the PVPh homopolymer 
in-between the PVPh layers of the copolymer. Consequently, coexistence of swollen and 
unswollen lamellae can be observed from TEM (cf. Figure 6c) at higher volume fractions of 
PVPh homopolymer. On the other hand, the Dtr changes only marginally (from 5.0 to 5.3 nm) in 
both the HS/V and HS/M blends, in a similar range of homopolymer volume fraction (0 -15 %); 
presumably, the added P4VP and PMMA homopolymers selectively reside at the interface areas 
with the PVPh blocks via hydrogen bonding; and the mixed PVPh and homopolymer chains act 
as a collective phase, resulting in a similar transition zone thickness. As the electron densities of 
the PVPh, PMMA, and P4VP, are all similar, it is difficult to differentiate the distribution of the 
homopolymer additive of PVPh, PMMA, or P4VP, in the PVPh blocks of the copolymer from the 
SAXS data; small angle neutron scattering with selected contrast variation will be more direct in 
addressing the issue of chain conformation of the additive homopolymers in a 
copolymers-homopolymer blend, as demonstrated by Hashimoto et al..36

Conclusions 
We have used FTIR spectroscopy, DSC, TEM, and SAXS techniques to investigate the 
phase behavior of the HS/V, HS/M, and HS/H blend systems of different hydrogen bonding 
strengths between the homopolymers and diblock copolymers. Integrated results show clearly 
that the phase behavior for the A-b-B/C type of polymer blends based on PS-b-PVPh, can be 
modulated via the hydrogen bonding strength between the homopolymer and copolymer. Fraction 
of hydrogen bonded groups may be used in quantitatively correlating the hydrogen bonding 
strength to the phase behavior of the polymer blends. With the inter-association equilibrium 
constant (KA) over self-association equilibrium constant (KB), KA/KB, much larger than unity, the 
phase behavior of the PS-b-PVPh/P4VP blend of strong hydrogen bonding strength follows 
closely that of the neat diblock copolymer; with a KA/KB value smaller than unity, the 
PS-b-PVPh/PMMA blend suffers a phase separation, instead of phase transition, at higher 
homopolymer volume fractions.
