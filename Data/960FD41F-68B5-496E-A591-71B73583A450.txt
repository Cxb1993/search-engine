1. Introduction 
The semiconductor manufacturing processes include photolithography, oxidation, 
etching, doping, planarization, washing, and cleaning [Chuang et al., 2002; Lin and 
Yang, 2004; Lien and Liu, 2006b]. As IC size smaller than 250 nm and wafer size 
changes to 8 in. and beyond, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is the only 
polishing technique that provides global planarization [Yang et al., 2003; Lien and 
Liu, 2006b]. However, the CMP has a major drawback in that it consumes a large 
amount of ultra pure water and produces approximately an equal amount of 
wastewater that is difficult to treat [Lin and Yang, 2004; Yang and Yang, 2004; Hu et 
al., 2005]. 
More than 90% of CMP wastewater generated in Taiwan is oxide-CMP type 
[Yang et al., 2003]. Normally, oxide-CMP wastewater is high in alkalinity, total 
solids content, and turbidity [Yang et al., 2003; Lin and Yang, 2004]. When all 
effluent from the CMP tools are mixed, then a high volume of wastewater with a high 
turbidity and total solids content has to be managed before discharge [Yang, 2002; 
Lien and Liu, 2006b]. The quality of CMP wastewater does not meet the current 
effluent standards if it is not treated. For this kind of wastewater, the potential 
treatment methods are coagulation / flocculation, flotation, microfiltration /

 The wastewater was taken from a semiconductor company in Hsinchu Science 
Park of Taiwan. The CMP wastewater was combination of oxide CMP wastewater 
and metal CMP wastewater. Polyelectrolyte used in this experiment were 
poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride, KP201C, poly(acryl acid), poly(acryl 
amide), MagnaFloc156 and polyampholyte T204.   
 Experiment was divided into 4 parts: analyzing the characteristics of CMP 
wastewater, single flocculation, dual flocculation, and breakage and reformation as 
shown in Figure 1.

 The test suspension was contained in 1 liter rectangular beaker with stirrer unit 
from jar test device [Phipps & Bird PB-700]. For dynamic monitoring, sample from 
one beaker was circulated through transparent plastic tubing (3mm ID) by means of a 
peristaltic pump. The pump was located after the PDA instrument to prevent floc

3. Methods and Materials 
The CMP wastewater was characterized and shown in Table 1. Both CMP 
wastewater had pH value higher than 9.5. It might be due to the KOH or NH4OH 
content in CMP wastewater [Yang and Yang, 2004]. Zeta potential result showed that 
the CMP wastewater contains high silica content. This analysis showed that first and 
second CMP wastewater mostly contains 40-48% silica and 52-60% oxygen with 
traces of other elements. The composition from EDS results indicated that the CMP 
wastewater contain mostly oxide CMP slurry rather than metal CMP slurry. This 
result agrees with some study [Hu et al., 2005] but disagrees with others [Yang et al., 
2003]. Total solids in CMP wastewater were 2100-2230 mg/L. This value agrees with 
previous works [Yang et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2005] that find total solids higher than 
1500 mg/L. TSS in CMP wastewater was 1200-1437 mg/L. The TSS values were 
much higher than previous works [Lai and Lin, 2003; Yang et al., 2003; Hu et al., 
2005]. Dissolved silica in this CMP wastewater (147.5-187.5 mg/L) was lower than 
previous study [Hu et al., 2005]. The phenomenon may occur because of the different 
process used by different semiconductor manufacturers and larger particles were 
resulted from the removed materials from the wafer surfaces during the CMP process 
[Yang and Yang, 2004].

made turbidity higher to 240-260 NTU. The increase in turbidity is a result of limited 
aggregation of submicron particles. Residual turbidity gradually decreased while 
KP201C dosages kept increasing until 50 mg/L. However, it still had higher residual 
turbidity than initial turbidity. It seemed KP201C can achieve good removal 
efficiency only if the dosage was increased 2-3 times than PDADMAC [Huang, 2001]. 
It might be due to charge density of KP201C is lower than PDADMAC. PAA and 
PAM did not show any decrease in turbidity even though the polymer dosages were 
increased.

Flocculation Index (FI) from PDA 2000 as shown in Figure 4, revealed the change of 
floc size from steady state reading to the end of slow mixing. Steadier floc size was 
found for PDADMAC than for KP201C. The floc size increased as the dosages of 
PDADMAC increased until it reached 30 mg/L, then it decreased. FI when using

because T204 is amphoteric polyelectrolyte. When wastewater was pre-conditioned 
with the cationic polyelectrolyte, it became adsorbed on the particles and formed 
more compact primary flocs. The amphoteric polyelectrolyte then became adsorbed 
on the loops and tails of the cationic polyelectrolyte by hydrogen bonding and van der 
Waals force. It provides bridging of the primary flocs to form aggregates [Lee and Liu, 
2000; 2001]. That was the reason the zeta potential did not change much. Hydrogen 
bonding and van der Waals force were the probable driving force for the non-ionic 
polyelectrolyte adsorption on particles [Somasundaran and Yu, 1994; Somasundaran 
and Krishnakumar, 1997; Lee and Liu, 2000] and the slipping plane moved outwards 
from the surface of the particles, resulting in a decrease in the absolute value of the 
zeta potential [Shimabayashi et al., 1992; Csempesz et al., 1998; Lee and Liu, 2000]. 
Therefore, the zeta potential was more positive than samples pre-coagulated with 
PDADMAC.

 The results showed that single flocculation of PDADMAC 30 mg/L and dual 
flocculation with 20 mg/L of PDADMAC and T204 had breakage factor of around 
20-24%. Thirty mg/L of PDADMAC had low recovery factor than the combination of 
PDADMAC and T204 which had a negative value. Higher dosage of T204 seemed to 
induce slightly higher recovery factor even though still in negative value. 
 Breakage factor for PDADMAC and AP410 had higher value at lower dosage (5 
mg/L), and decreased with increase in AP410 dosage. It showed that higher dosage 
can produce larger and stronger floc. The recovery factor had opposite trend with 
breakage factor. Its value increased when using higher dosage of AP410, it even 
reached higher than 100% (123%). Cationic – anionic dual polymer system generated 
flocs with lower breakage factors and higher recovery factors (flocs with higher 
strength) than single polymers [Yukselen et al., 2005]. In this case, it is valid only 
when using higher dosage. 
 The combination of PDADMAC and MagnaFloc156 gave constant value of 
breakage factor of around 28-32%. A change in second polymer dosage did not affect 
the breakage factors. However, it had some effects on recovery factors. When using 
2.5-6 mg/L of MagnaFloc156, the effect on recovery factors was insignificant. 
Addition of higher dosage of MagnaFloc156 to 8-10 mg/L increased the recovery 
factor higher than 100%.  
 This phenomenon occurred because MagnaFloc156 at higher dosage did not 
disperse well and form non uniform flocs. Some large flocs were too large to go 
through the 3mm ID tube of PDA2000, which made the FI before breakage steeply 
decreased after MagnaFloc156 was added. The breakage actually made the flocs to 
 
18 
3. On the other hand, dual flocculation using combination PDADMAC and T204 
also can enhance the flocculation with less dosage than the optimum dosage in 
single flocculation and gave broader optimum dose. 
4. Increasing shear rate could cause breakage of flocs to smaller size. After breakage, 
reformation of flocs may occur on restoring the previous low shear rate. When 
using PDADMAC and high dosage of AP410 or MagnaFloc156, reformation of 
flocs occurred. In dual flocculation using PDADMAC with T204, low dosage of 
AP410, and low dosage MagnaFloc156 did not show any reformation of flocs.

1. Introduction 
Phosphorus is commonly found in municipal wastewater with concentration ranging 
from 4 to 12 mg/l [1]. It can be removed by biological processes and chemical 
precipitation processes. Higher concentrations of phosphate are also present in landfill 
leachate and wastewaters from some conventional industries, such as fertilizer and 
electroplating. It is noted that both semiconductor and optoelectronic industries produce 
significant amount of wastewater that contains very high concentration of phosphate, 
since phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is extensively used in etching unit in semiconductor and 
thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) fabrication [2]. According to a 
survey conducted by Taiwan EPA, average phosphate concentration in optoelectronic 
wastewater is 297 mg/l with a maximum of 1505 mg/l, while it averages 63 mg/l with a 
maximum of 220 mg/l in semiconductor wastewater. Practical experiences among some 
electronic and optoelectronic plants in Taiwan show that biological processes may not be 
suitable in treating high-phosphate wastewater, owing to the complex operation and 
limited efficiency.  Thus, the existing wastewater treatment process usually consists of 
chemical precipitation using calcium salts, followed by biological process. Even so, the 
treated effluent still contains phosphate in the range of 50 – 70 mg/l and is a major 
environmental concern. It is imperative to investigate more effective methods in removing 
high concentration of phosphate from wastewater. 
 separates by flotation apatite preferentially from a solution containing dolomite [7 - 10]. 
Therefore, the mechanism of the adsorption of SOl on apatite has been extensively studied, 
mainly because of the important role of adsorption in flotation [6, 11]. It has to be pointed 
out that the species and ion composition in the aqueous phase affect the flotation 
separation behaviors significantly. On the premise that the differences in solution 
chemistry between apatite ore suspension and wastewater containing calcium phosphate 
precipitates can be well delineated, dispersed air flotation (DiAF) appears to be an 
excellent alternative technique for treating the phosphate-containing wastewater, knowing 
that flotation processes posses advantages of small footprint, flexible operation, and high 
efficiency.. The major objectives of the current work were to study the feasibility of 
utilizing DiAF in precipitation flotation of phosphate-containing wastewater, and to 
investigate important parameters in the design and operation of DiAF. 
  
 
2. Materials and Methods 
Stock solutions of synthetic wastewater and calcium chloride were made by dissolving 
potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4, Merck) and calcium chloride dehydrate 
(CaCl2．2H2O, Merck), respectively in water. Measured amount of Ca2+ solution was 
added to 1 liter of phosphate-containing water (100 mg/l) to obtain different molar ratio of 
 which possible solid phases can be included with their characteristic values of solubility 
product (Ksp), enthalpy, and stoichiometric coefficient. 
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 Experimental residual phosphate concentrations as compared with model 
predictions are shown in Fig. 1. Molar ratio, [Ca2+]/[HPO42-], of 1:1 resulted in residual 
phosphate concentration of 35 mg/l at pH 10, and decreased to 30 mg/l as pH became 
higher. Higher removal efficiency of phosphate was found at molar ratio of 2:1, and 
residual phosphate of < 3 mg/l was obtained at molar ratio of 3:1 at pH > 9.0. It is in 
agreement with literature that calcium phosphate precipitation is almost complete for pH 
> 9.8 [14]. It was found that residual phosphate concentrations at pH > 6 were all higher 
than model predictions regardless of molar ratio. Chemical equilibrium between calcium 
and phosphate at molar ratio of 2:1 or 3:1, as predicted by PHREEQC, shows that HAP 
starts to form at pH > 5.0, and HAP is the dominant species for pH > 6.5. However, it has 
been indicated that precipitation reaction of HAP is very slow, and a number of species, 
such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and brushite, 
act as precursors to the precipitation of HAP; With time these species will be transformed 
to HAP [15, 16]. The dominant precipitates formed, depending upon pH, are in fact 
brushite, monetite, and ACP, while predicted equilibrium solubility is much lower since it 
 decreased slightly with increasing SDS concentration, and became negative only at SDS 
concentration of 250 mg/l. The decrease was caused by the charge neutralization as SDS 
was adsorbed on solid surfaces [17]. It is probable for Ca2+ to react with SDS and form 
Ca(DS)2 precipitate whose solubility product is 10-9.7. Since the remaining Ca2+ 
concentration is 1.55 x 10-3 M, Ca(DS)2 will form as SDS concentration exceeds 100 
mg/l/. Fig. 4B shows that zeta potential abruptly decreased in the presence of SOl, and 
charge reversal was found at low concentration of SOl. It can be explained by the 
adsorption of SOl. Monolayer chemisorption is predominant and occurs by the reaction of 
carboxylate head group with surface calcium sites of apatite surface when oleate 
concentration is low [6]. The adsorption of SOl on apatite could become bilayer, and 
surface calcium oleate precipitation will occur under high adsorption density; and result in 
significant decrease in zeta potential [18]. Flotation of hydrophilic apatite requires the 
adsorption of surfactant to render the mineral surface hydrophobic, and flotation reaction 
is controlled by the formation and adsorption of calcium oleate in the interfacial region 
[11].  
Effects of ionic strength on the removal of phosphate and calcium phosphate 
precipitates are illustrated in Figs. 5A and 5B. Residual phosphate concentration 
increased gradually as sodium nitrate (NaNO3) concentration increased, due to the 
decreased activity of phosphate ion. It is noted that the flotation removal of calcium 
 Since mixed acids are commonly used in etching unit in both semiconductor and 
optoelectronic industries, anion interference was studied by using 0.05 M of NaNO3, 0.05 
M of NaCl, and 0.0125 M of Na2SO4 as background electrolyte of identical ionic strength, 
respectively. It was found that flotation removal of calcium precipitates, using SDS as 
collector, decreased from 70 % to 55 % when NaNO3 was replaced by NaCl, and to 36 % 
in the case by Na2SO4 (Table 2). This is in agreement with literature that anion with 
higher valency has stronger effect on flotation efficiency [20]. It is because both SO42- and 
Cl- could potentially be specifically adsorbed onto solid surfaces and interferes with the 
adsorption of SDS. Again, flotation was not affected by anions when SOl was the 
collector. It could be reasoned that the chemisorption of SOl onto calcium phosphate 
precipitates was not affected by anions. 
Application of precipitation flotation in treating industrial wastewater with high 
concentration of phosphate seemed feasible from the study. Very low residual phosphate 
concentration could be obtained as long as molar ratio and pH are properly controlled. 
The separation of calcium phosphate precipitates could be induced by anionic collectors, 
even under situations of high ionic strength or presence of interfering anions. Advantages 
of the process include reusable sludge, flexible operation, and small footprint. However, 
some issues need to be examined in further study. For example, to minimize excess  Ca2+
