back layer [20].  The carbon dioxide bubble should be removed efficiently.  
Otherwise, the anode channels will be blocked, leading to limited mass transport.  In 
the present study, the back layer (usually made of carbon cloth or carbon paper) is 
regarded as a porous medium.  Growth and detachment of carbon dioxide bubbles on 
the porous surface will be investigated with a proposed bubble detachment criterion. 
 
2. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS 
2.1 Governing equations 
Consider a water of semi-infinity ( ∞≥Z ) above an infinite horizontal porous 
surface on the XY-plane.  Initially, the water is pure and stationary.  At 0>t , a 
uniform carbon dioxide flux Q injects from the porous surface such that carbon 
dioxide bubbles nucleate, grow, and detach at some particular sites on the porous 
surface.  The contact angle of water on the porous surface is °= 65θ .  The process 
is assumed to be isothermal and incompressible.  Evaporation of water is neglected.  
Bubbles nucleate only on the porous surface, while the distance between any two 
neighboring nucleation sites is a as illustrated in Fig. 1.  Due to physical symmetry, 
the problem is formulated for a single site inside a hexangular cylinder.  For 
simplicity, the physical domain is further simplified as an axisymmetric problem 
inside a circular cylinder of radius 0R  having the same cross-section area as the 
regular hexagon, i.e.

The configuration of the problem is depicted in Fig. 2 in cylindrical coordinates 
),( rz , where the bubble shape is represented by 
),( τzfr =                              (2) 
The bubble has a height )(τb , a base radius ),0( τf , and a contact angle θ .  Note 
that the geometry showed in Fig. 2 has been nondimensionalized with a reference 
length L, i.e. 
LZz /= , LRr /= , LRr /00 = , LtZFzf /),(),( =τ , ctt /=τ         (3) 
where the reference length L and reference time ct  are to be defined.  The natural 
convection effect is neglected.  All of the thermophysical properties are assumed 
constant.

−=                         (14) 
which represents the hydrostatic buoyancy force. 
It is important to note that the quantity pˆ  appearing in the momentum 
equations (6) and (7) is a flow-induced pressure (known as dynamic pressure in the 
literature [9]).  In quiescent fluids, the pressure pˆ  has a zero gradient in all 
directions and thus becomes an arbitrary constant in each fluid.  This means that the 
pressure jump pˆ∆  can be treated as an arbitrary constant.  In the present study, the 
flow due to bubble growth is assumed very weak such that variation of the pressure 
jump pˆ∆  along the bubble surface is negligibly small as compared to the hydrostatic 
buoyancy force.  Therefore, the Young-Laplace equation (13) further reduces to

−=                          (16) 
to yield 1=Bo , where tipκ  is the curvature of the bubble tip at bz = .  Equation 
(15) indicates that the curvature decreases linearly from tipκκ =  at the bubble tip 
( bz = ) to btip −= κκ  at the bubble base ( 0=z ) due to the hydraulic buoyancy 
force.  The value of refz  has been absorbed into tipκ  and thus does not affect the 
formulation (15). 
Equations (12) and (15) form a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential 
equation for the bubble shape ),( τzfr = .  The associated boundary conditions are 
0),( =τbf ,  −∞=′ ),( τbf ,  θτ cotf −=′ ),0(              (17) 
The problem is time-dependent because the bubble height b depends on time.  It is of 
great numerical difficulty to solve the problem due to the fact that ),( τzf  has an 
infinite derivative at the bubble tip.  Numerical difficulty would arise also from the 
Neumann boundary condition at the bubble base when the contact angle is zero 
( 0=θ ).  In the present study, the problem is solved with the geometry method [22] 
that handles the evolute of a curve (center of curvature) rather than the curve itself.  
Such a strategy circumvents the numerical difficulty successfully. 
For a given bubble height b and a tip curvature tipκ , the bubble shape can be 
obtained by solving Eqs. (12), (15) and (17).  Figure 3(a) shows the resulting contact 
angle θ  on the porous surface ( 0=z ) as a function of tipκ  under a few prescribed 
bubble heights b.  From Fig. 3(a) it is found that the problem could have multiple 
solutions for a given b.  For instance, there are at least three solution modes for the 
case of 4.1=b  that satisfy all of the boundary conditions (17) with °= 65θ .  As 
depicted in Fig. 3(b), the three solution modes share the same bubble height and 
 6
detaches from the surface.  The transition between solution modes might be 
attributed to hydraulic instability.  Figure 6 shows the bubble shapes of solution 
modes 1 and 2 at 3241.0=v  for the case of °= 65θ .  The height and base area 
))0( ,( 2fb  for the two bubbles are )2440.0 ,15.1(  and )06876.0 ,43.1( .  This 
means that the bubble should experience a very severe base area shrinking (the base 
area ratio is 0.2828) when jumps from solution mode 1 toward solution mode 2 in the 
detachment period.  The postulated mechanism for bubble detachment is assumed 
valid for all contact angles, although it might not be so significant in the cases of 
small contact angles. 
 
2.4 Boundary Conditions 
For simplicity, the governing equations (5)-(8) are solved only in the liquid 
region in the present study.  Hence, both *ρ  and *µ  are assigned as unity in the 
momentum equations (6) and (7).  This implies the need of a set of properly defined 
boundary conditions on the bubble surface.  On the liquid side of the bubble surface, 
the saturation concentration is

/γκ−==                         (19) 
based on the Henry law and the Young-Laplace equation (11a), where H is the Henry 
constant [23].  This leads to the boundary condition

where Γ  denotes the bubble surface while the second term on the RHS of Eq. (22a) 
denotes the net mass influx from the liquid region through the bubble surface.  The 
first term is the mass injection directly from the porous surface on the bubble base.  
Hence, the bubble volume at the next time step can be estimated from

once the growing rate of the bubble τddv /  is available, where τ∆  is the time step 
employed in the numerical simulation. 
In the present study, the corresponding bubble height b and tip curvature tipκ  
are obtained from Fig. 5(a) for a given bubble volume v .  Based on the two 
parameters, the bubble shape )(zfr =  is determined with the geometry method [22].  
Figure 7 illustrates the movement of the bubble shape from τ  to τ∆τ + .  The 
 8
associated boundary conditions (20), (22), (25), and (26).  The solution procedure 
starts with a given seed bubble of 004401.0=v  ( 23.0=b ) under the initial condition 
0)0,,( =rzu ,  0)0,,( =rzv ,  0)0,,( =rzφ               (30) 
The computational domain is truncated at 5max =z .  For simplicity, the pressure 
level is defined by 0),,(ˆ max =τrzp .  After some preliminary grid tests, it is found 
that the numerical solution for the diffusion equation (8) is not sensitive to the grid 
mesh.  Hence, a uniform Cartesian grid system 01.0== rz ∆∆  under a uniform 
time step 01.0=τ∆  is employed for all of the computations in the present study. 
Figure 8 shows the evolution of the resulting bubble shape for the case of 30 =r  
and 10=q .  The velocity on the surface of the seed bubble is zero (30), and thus 
01.0=τ  shares the same bubble profile with 0=τ  as depicted in Fig. 8.  In the 
present case the bubble shrinks at the very beginning of the diffusion process and 
subsequently grows to the maximum base area and then detaches from the porous 
surface at 1412.0=τ  with a volume of 3241.0=v .  The velocity field and isobars 
just before bubble detachment (at 1412.0=τ ) are shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b), 
respectively.  At this particular moment, both volume and height of the bubble could 
be still increasing while the base area of the bubble starts to shrink (see Fig. 5(a)).  
Hence, the velocity in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) occurs primarily on the bubble top area that 
has the maximum velocity 52.12=u  or sm / 850.8 µ  at the bubble tip. 
The corresponding concentration at the same moment is revealed in Figure 9(c).  
Figure 9(c) shows that the concentration on the liquid side of the bubble surface is 
essentially unity because the surface tension effect is negligibly small ( 1<<Ω ).  The 
mass (carbon dioxide) flux enters the bubble from the lower part (below the 
iso-concentration curve for 1=φ ) while leaves on the upper part.  The maximum 
concentration 38.4=φ  occurs at )1 ,0(),( =rz .  Use of 5max =z  seems to be 
adequate for the present study. 
Bubble detachment from a solid surface is a very complicated fluid flow problem.  
Fortunately, the detachment period is usually very short as compared to the growth 
period.  For simplicity, a fictional concentration distribution with a “seed” bubble is 
defined in Fig. 10(a) such that the liquid volume below each of the iso-concentration 
surfaces (i.e. =φ 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,…etc) in Fig. 10(a) is identical to the counterpart in Fig. 
9(c).  A comparison between Figs. 9(c) and 10(a) is depicted in Fig. 10(b).  The 
particular concentration in Fig. 10(a) is employed as the “initial” condition for the 
growth period of the second bubble.  The numerical procedure is repeated for 20 
bubbles in the present work.  Similar definition of “initial” concentration is 
employed for each of the other 18 bubbles.  Bubble shrinkage is found to occur only 
at the very beginning of the growth period of the first bubble due to the assumed zero 
concentration in the environment liquid.  Figure 11 shows the concentration just 
before the detachment of the 20th bubble.  The maximum concentration occurs at 
42.8)6720. ,0( =φ .  This implies that bubble nucleation might take place on the 
porous surface [27] in the vicinity of the main bubble similar to that observed by Nam 
et al. in their experiment [10].  However, homogeneous nucleation in the liquid is not 
possible.  It requires a supersaturation of 17001100 ≤≤φ  for carbonated beverage 
as reported by Wilt [27]. 
Figure 12(a) shows the bubble growth time nτ  required for the n-th bubble 
under )10 ,65() ,( °=qθ  and various values of 0r .  As expected, the growth time 
deceases as the bubble number increases due to the increasing concentration in the
