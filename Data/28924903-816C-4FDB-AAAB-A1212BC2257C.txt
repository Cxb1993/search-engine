1200 8C for 4 h. The calcined powder was re-milled for 12 h
using PVA solution as a binder. The obtained fine powder was
then crushed into a finer powder through a sieve with a
200 mesh. This finer powder was then axially pressed at
2000 kg/cm2 into pellets with a diameter of 11 mm and a
thickness of 6 mm. The specimens thus obtained were then
heat-treated at 600 8C for 4 h to eliminate the PVA, before
being sintered at temperatures of 1450–1650 8C for 4 h in air.
Both the heating rate and the cooling rate were set to 10 8C/min.
Following sintering, the phases of the samples were
investigated by X-ray diffraction. An X-ray Rigaku D/MAX-
2200 was utilized with CuKa radiation (at 30 kV and 20 mA)
and a graphite monochromator in the 2u range of 108–808. The
polished samples were thermally etched at a temperature
100 8C below that of sintering temperature. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-6500F, Japan) and energy
dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) were carried out to
examine the microstructures of the specimens. The grain sizes
were measured by line intercept method. The apparent densities
of the specimens were measured using the liquid Archimedes
method using distilled water. The A&D GF-300 Digital Scale
was used to measure the apparent densities. The precision of
A&D GF-300 Digital Scale is 0.001 g. The microwave
dielectric properties of the specimens were measured by the
postresonator method that was developed by Hakki and
Coleman [14]. This method employs a specimen in the form
of a cylinder of diameter D and length L. The cylindrical
resonator was polished using fine emery paper to make the
surfaces flat, smooth, and parallel; it was then washed with
acetone in an ultra sonic bath for measurements. The cylindrical
resonator was sandwiched between two finely polished brass
plates. The specimens whose microwave dielectric property
were measured had an aspect ratio D/L of approximately 1.6,
which is in the permitted range that was determined by
Kobayashi and Katoh [15]. The cylindrical resonator was
sandwiched between two conducting plates. Two small
antennas were positioned in the vicinity of the specimen to
couple the microwave signal power into or out of the resonator.
The other ends of the antennas were connected to an Agilent
E5071C network analyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa
Clara, CA). The resonance characteristics depended on the size
and the microwave dielectric properties of the specimen. The
microwave energy was coupled using electric-field probes. The
TE011 resonant mode was optimal for determining the dielectric
constant and the loss factor of the specimen. The Agilent
E5071C network analyzer was adopted to identify the TE011
resonant frequency of the dielectric resonator, and the dielectric
constant and quality factor were calculated. The conductor loss
of the end plates must be subtracted to obtain the quality factor.
For this purpose, two specimens with different heights were
prepared, where the height of the specimen for the TE012 mode
measurement was twice as large as that of the specimen for the
TE011 mode. The approach for measuring tf was the same as
that for measuring the dielectric constant. The test cavity was
placed in a chamber and the temperature was increased from 25
to 75 8C. The tf value (ppm/8C) was determined from the
change in resonant frequency:
t f ¼ f 2  f 1
f 1ðT2  T1Þ
; (1)
where f1 and f2 denote the resonant frequencies at T1 and T2,
respectively.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 presents the X-ray diffraction patterns of
Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.4Ti0.1)O3 ceramics that were sintered at 1450–
1650 8C for 4 h. Small amount of Nd2Sn2O7 as the second
phase is accompanied. Nd2Sn2O7 with cubic crystal structure
(ICDD-PDF #88–0448) was identified and difficult to
completely eliminate from the sample prepared by mixed
oxide route. As shown in Fig. 1, the (2 2 2) and (4 0 0) peaks of
the Nd2Sn2O7 ceramics were at 29.2538 and 33.9058,
respectively. The formation of the Sn-rich second phase
Nd2Sn2O7 was attributed to the loss of MgO upon ignition. The
formation of Nd2Sn2O7 might deteriorate the dielectric
constant and quality factor of the specimen. A later
investigation will involve preparation of the powder by
precipitation from solution. Such a method may yield a
single-phase product. A single-phase product potentially has
much higher values of the parameters of interest. A series of
extra peaks were observed to correspond to superlattice
reflections. All of the superlattice reflections were indexed
using half integer Miller indices. According to Glazer, the

Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3 and Nd2Sn2O7, respectively, and D1
and D2 are the theoretical density of Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3
and Nd2Sn2O7, respectively. Table 1 shows the theoretical
density and relative density of Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3 ceramics
with different degrees of Ti4+ substitution, following sintering
at 1550 8C for 4 h. The relative densities of Nd(Mg0.5
Sn0.5xTix)O3 ceramics that were sintered at 1550 8C for 4 h
decreased from 99.63% to 96.97% as x increased from 0 to 0.2.
Fig. 6 shows the dielectric constants of Nd(Mg0.5
Sn0.5xTix)O3 ceramics with different degrees of Ti
4+ substitu-
tion, following sintering at 1450–1650 8C for 4 h.
Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.3Ti0.2)O3 ceramics that were sintered at 1500 8C
for 4 h had a maximum dielectric constant of 22.8. A high
dielectric constant of Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.3Ti0.2)O3 ceramics that were
sintered at 1500 8C for 4 h did not depend on a high sintering
temperature. The decrease in dielectric constant was associated
with low apparent densities of the ceramics. A higher density is
associated with lower porosity, and, therefore, a higher dielectric
constant. The dielectric constant of the composites can be
calculated by the mixture rule:
log er ¼ V1 log er1 þ V2 log er2; (4)
where er is the dielectric constant of the composite, V1 and V2
are the volume fraction of Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3 and
Nd2Sn2O7, respectively, and er1 and er2 are the dielectric
constant of Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3 and Nd2Sn2O7, respective-
ly. Since the dielectric constant of Nd2Sn2O7 ceramics was 17.0
as shown in Table 3, the appearance of Nd2Sn2O7 deteriorated
the dielectric constants of specimens. The dielectric constant of
Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3 ceramics increased from 19.3 to 22.7 as
x increased from 0 to 0.2 when the Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3
ceramics were sintered at 1550 8C for 4 h. Although the relative
density decreased as x increased as shown in Table 1, the
dielectric constant of Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3 ceramics in-
creased as x increased from 0 to 0.2. This fact may be explained
by the molar volume and ionic polarization, as suggested by
Tohto et al. [19] the dielectric constant can be calculated using
the Clausius–Mossotti equation:
er ¼ 3Vm þ 8paD
3Vm  4paD (5)
where Vm represents the molar volume and aD is the sum of the
ionic polarizabilities of individual ions. The dielectric constant
calculated by Eq. (5) was intrinsic factor to dielectric property.
Dielectric constants therefore depend on the molar volume and
ionic polarization. As indicated by Eq. (5), a smaller molar
volume or a larger ionic polarization is associated with a larger
dielectric constant. The influence of ionic polarization on dielec-
tric constant is much larger than that of molar volume. The ionic
polarization of Ti4+ ion and Sn4+ ions are 2.93 and 2.83 A˚3,
respectively [20,21]. The sum of ionic polarizations of individual
ions of Nd(Mg0.5Sn0.5xTix)O3 ceramics increased as x in-
