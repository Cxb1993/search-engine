After rate-distortion optimizing, h.264 will choose the best coding 
mode with the least sad. With this sad, our algorithm may obtain 
mean coding rate for the encoded MB. The MB coding rate is 
estimated based on the pre-trained probability density model [8]. 
Then, we use the kalman filter method to re-estimate the QP for 
the current MB. The basic concept of using kalman filter is that we 
stimate the QP based on the difference between the frame target bit 
rate and the frame measurement bit rate. If the estimated QP leads 
to a larger measurement bit rate, then we increase the QP else we 
decrease the QP. The increment or decrement of QP is limited with 
±2. The flow diagram of our rate-control scheme is shown in fig. 1. 
The frame-level rate control 
The rapid algorithm is modified to estimate the frame QP before 
motion estimation. For h.264, we neglect the target bit adjustment 
based on the past history of each vo and the current coding 
complexity.

Where ni, nb and np are the numbers of i, p and b frames which

weight factors. Rr,t is the remaining bit for the image sequence. 
α(k), is α(i), α(b), or α(p) corresponding to the current frame type. 
2) target bits adjustment based on the buffer occupancy 
The pid buffer controller aims to keep buffer fullness around the 
target buffer fullness to avoid the chance of buffer overflow or 
buffer underflow. Pidt controller is defined as:

the current frame can be computed using the quadratic r-d model,

coefficients. 
4) weight adjustment for frame types 
Α(i), α(b) and α(p) are the weight factors for i, b and p-frames, 
respectively, and they are used in target bit allocation. Α(p) is fixed 
to 1.0. Α(b) and α(p) are adjusted with the average psnr of previous 
encoded frames [7].  
The MB-level rate control 
We first introduce the method that measures the conditional mean 
rate for the MB by estimating the joint probability density function 
(pdf) of the r-d curve [8]. The measurement of the conditional 
mean rate will be used as the measurement equation for the kalman 
filtering to estimate the MB QP in the MB-level rate control. 
1) estimate the conditional mean for the MB rate 
To estimate the MB rate, we need to solve the non-linear 
function MBrate= f(QP, sad, picture_type, mode) in terms of the 
joint pdf, i.e., fQP, picture_type, mode(MBrate, sad). Training vectors give 
probabilities associated with the QP and MBrate depending on the 
sad, picture_type and coding mode. The learned joint probability is 
used to estimate the conditional mean E(MBrate|sad). In our 
algorithm, the random variables x1, x2, x3, x4 and y denote the QP, 
sad, picture type, mode and the rate of the MB, respectively. Then 
we can estimate the joint probability density function using 
parzen’s windows as

To reduce the computational complexity, we generate the 
training data by fixing the QP within an admissible range. Since 
we collect training data depending on QP and picture-type, we can 
define a new joint pdf by fixing QP, picture type and coding mode 
as
