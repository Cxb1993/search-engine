Abstract 
The anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) has 
been extensively used to the illness of 
intervertebral disk. Posterior stabilization can 
increase the fusion rate of ALIF. However, the 
discrepancy of biomechanical properties resulted 
from different implants and posterior fixations. 
We used finite element analysis to analyze the 
biomechanical properties for different posterior 
instrumentation constructs after two level ALIF 
with titanium cylindrical cages. 
二、計劃緣由及目的 
前方骨融合術 (Anterior Lumbar Interbody 
Fusion, ALIF)，已被廣用於治療腰椎椎間盤病
變[1,2]，金屬與其它生醫材料之椎籠 (cage)
因而被發展出，主要為了可減少取骨處(donor 
site)之病痛、作為前方椎柱的支撐、回復椎間
盤原有的高度、提高椎體的剛性、增加骨融合
的成功率，因此造成骨融合速度緩慢、椎籠陷
入(subsidence)椎籠滑動的現象[1-9]。 
針對金屬椎籠陷入或滑動的情形，可加入
後方固定器(posterior fixator)予以改善，後方固
定器主要由椎弓足螺絲(pedicle screw)與桿件
組合而成，其目的除了矯正脊椎的畸形(如脊
椎側彎)等病症同時減少椎籠與椎骨間的相對
滑移而增加手術區域的穩定性，因此可大大的
提升術後環節的穩定度，但由於後方固定器剛
性過強因此將造成椎籠內部骨頭的應力遮閉
(stress shielding)現象，而且其手術時間、破壞
的組織與價格較其它固定方式大出許多
[10-16]，考量以上，若能使用不同的後方固定
器或能得到改善，臨床上包含了橫穿椎板關節
面螺絲(translaminar facet)與橫穿關節面椎弓
足螺絲(transfacetopedicular screw)兩種。 
不同的後方固定器，將有不同的生物力學
特性，因此本研究將針對兩環節椎籠骨融合
時，搭配不同後方固定器，包含三節椎弓足螺
絲固定器(level transpedicular screw and rod, 
3TPS-R)，橫穿椎板關節面螺絲 (translaminar 
facet screw fixation, TLFS)和橫穿關節面椎弓
足螺絲(transfacetopedicular screw, TFPS)，如圖
2 至圖 4，之脊椎穩定度力學分析。 
 
三、結果與討論 
本研究使用之模型為利用電腦斷層掃描
(CT)截取36歲之健康男性腰椎L3-L5之掃描資
料，並利用三維繪圖軟體進行L3-L5模型之建
立。  
將建立好圓柱型椎籠，如圖1，依解剖學放置
位置分別成對植入模型腰椎L3/L4與L4/L5的
椎間盤，在以不同的固定器(3TPS-R, TLFS, 
TFPS)，共3組模型如圖2-圖3。  
在本研究所使用之有限元素分析軟體為
COSMOSWorks2005 版 ， 其 程 式 掛 載 於
Solidworks 3D繪圖軟體下，所以在Solidworks 
完 成 3D 模 型 繪 製 後 ， 可 直 接 利 用
COSMOSWorks6.0運算， 免於載入其他FEM
軟體的過程，L3-L5模型中的元素分割設定，
整體(global)的元素尺寸為4mm，局部(local)的
元素尺寸在椎籠、椎弓足螺絲和facet 螺絲分
別定義為1.5mm。 
邊界條件為，L3上方施加各負載，軸向壓
手術環節的不穩定造成骨融合成功率的減
少，不穩定造成的原因無非是更多的組織被移
除 2-level facet 的牽引(distraction)的結果，
facet 的分離(間隙的增加)和 capsule 的移除
造成 facet joint 無力抵抗各彎矩下的位移，尤
其 在 側 彎 (lateral-bending) 和  伸 張
(extension)，因為這些受力狀態時的椎籠支撐
點靠近於這些負載的旋轉軸，因此能抵抗的力
臂小。且側彎時只有單側邊的椎籠為主要支
撐，因此更難以抵抗角位移的發生，因此椎籠
單獨使用時無法提供 2-level ALIF 穩定的環
境，因此額外加入後方固定方式是必需的，在
臨床中，3TPS-R 被認為可以提供最好的穩定
度(將 extension 大幅降低)，因此本研究以這個
gold standard 的穩定度評價其它固定方法的穩
定能力。相同於臨床的結果，本研究結果中
3TPS-R 提供最好的穩定度。 
兩種 facet screw fixation 在負載 extension 
與 flexion 時穩定度是與 3TPS-R 相似的，但
在 rotation 較差尤其在 lateral-bending 與
3TPS-R 差別更明顯，因為在這兩種不對稱的
負載下，3TPS-R 可提供類似六個位置的抵抗
能力，相較多於 TLFS 與 TFPS 四個位置抵抗
能力。 
 
後方固定器的總應變能 
後方固定器的總應變能的比較結果如圖
7，在 3TPS-R 在 lateral bending 與 rotation 負
載下的應變能顯著的大於 flexion 與
extension。在 TLFS, TFPS,模型中，lateral 
bending 負載下的總應變能顯著的大於其它
負載。 
    在不對稱負載時 3TPS-R 有較大的應變
能，証明在 lateral bending 與 rotation 時經由
3TPS-R 承受較大的負載，在兩種 facet screw 
固定方法所吸受的總應變能來看，可知 2-level 
ALIF 使用 facet screw 固定方式在側彎下時，
它們不但有最大的角位移，而且螺絲也產生很
大的應變能，由此可知，在不穩定與大應變能
同時發生的情況，若加上術後交變的負載，也
許會發生 facet 螺絲的失效與破壞。 
本研究論證 1.在正常的骨強度下，後方固
定器對椎籠與骨介面之抗壓強度沒有很大的
影響性，2.3TPS-R 提供最好的穩定度，3.facet 
screw 固定方式在 flexion 和 extension 提供好
的穩定性，但 lateral-bending 下可能加大不穩
定與螺絲破壞與失效的可能性，此結果可提供
臨床參考。

Abstract 
Improper design of vertebral body cages may 
seriously affect the interface strength and cause 
the lose of fixation for a vertebral body 
replacement. This research used a FEM-based 
Taguchi method to investigate the effects of 
various factors to find the robust design of the 
body cage. Three-dimensional finite element 
models with a nonlinear contact analysis have 
been developed to simulate the pullout strength 
of the body cage. Then, the Taguchi robust 
design method was used to evaluate the spike 
design. In a situation without bone fusion, the 
spike row, the spike oblique, and the spike 
height were especially important factors. The 
optimum combination has been found to be the 
pyramidal spike type, a spike height of 2 mm, a 
spike diameter of 2.2 mm, an oblique geometry, 
11 rows per 28 mm, and an inner diameter of 10 
mm. In a situation with bone fusion, the spike 
row, the spike height, and the inner diameter 
were the most significant factors. Here, the 
optimum combination has been found to be the 
conical spike type, a spike height of 2 mm, a 
spike diameter of 2.2 mm, an oblique geometry, 
11 rows per 28 mm, and an inner diameter of 20 
mm. The finite element analyses could be used 
to predict the interface stiffness of the body 
cages. The FEM-based Taguchi methods have 
effectively decreased the time and effort required 
for evaluating the design variables of implants 
and have fairly assessed the contribution of each 
design variable. 
1. Introduction 
Body cages have been used to treat vertebral 
bodies with different maladies such as severe 
compression fracture, dislocation, tumor, or 
infection [1-3]. However, a vertebral body 
replacement commonly experiences graft 
fracture, loosening, and collapse in a short 
period after an orthopaedic surgery. From the 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Finite element analysis 
Finite element analysis is a powerful tool to 
examine complex sample shapes with 
complicated loading and boundary conditions 
[22]. For this research, the three- dimensional 
finite element models which consisted of the 
body cage and both bone cuffs were created. The 
CAD program SolidWorks 2005 (SolidWorks 
Corporation, Concord, MA, USA) and the finite 
element software COSMOSworks 2005 
(Structural Research and Analysis Corporation, 
Los Angeles, CA, USA) were used. Six design 
factors of the body cage were considered 
including the spike type ( ST ), the spike height 
( SH ), the spike diameter ( SD ), the spike 
oblique ( SO ), the spike row ( SR ), and the 
inner diameter ( ID ) (Fig. 1). The body cage 
was 50 mm in height and 28 mm in outer 
diameter. Two bricks of bone cuffs (50 mm×50 
mm×10 mm) were assumed to simulate the 
surrounding bones of a vertebral body with 
osteoporosis. 
A three-dimensional isotropic tetrahedral solid 
element was used for modeling the body cage 
and the bone cuffs. The body cage and the bone 
cuffs were free-meshed and the convergent 
analysis was done by resetting the element size 
controls. For the models without bone fusion, a 
total number of elements ranged from 46,000 to 
209,000 and a total number of nodes ranged 
from 71,000 to 286,000. For the models with 
bone fusion, a total number of elements ranged 
from 38,000 to 289,000 and a total number of 
nodes ranged from 55,000 to 380,000. The 
elastic modulus of the body cage which was 
made from Ti6Al4V was 114 GPa. The bone 
cuffs were assumed to be homogenous with an 
elastic modulus of 137.5 MPa. The Poisson’s 
ratio was 0.3 for both the body cage and the 
bone cuffs. The interfaces between the body 
cage and the bone cuffs were contact, with the 
penetrating spikes pointing in the direction of the 
body cage displacement. The coefficient of 
friction was set to zero. In the loading condition, 
a compressive force of 200 N was loaded on the 
end surface of both bone cuffs. In real life, the 
causes and conditions of pull out are 
complicated, but for the present study, we 
assumed that a displacement of 0.1 mm was 
applied to the surface of the body cage to 
simulate a pull out. The boundary conditions 
were constrained at the outer surfaces of the 
bone cuffs in the z direction to simulate the body 
cage pull out from the bones (Fig. 2A). 
In order to investigate the effects of bone fusion, 
two models, with and without bone fusion, were 
analyzed. In the situation with bone fusion, the 
elastic modulus of the fusion bone remained at 
137.5 MPa. The fusion bone was inserted inside 
the body cage and the interface between the 
fusion bone and the adjacent vertebral bodies 
(the bone cuffs) was assumed to be a perfect 
bond. In the postprocessing analysis, the total 
reaction force was chosen to represent the bone 
adhesion to the body cage. The total reaction 
force was defined to be the summation of the 
nodal reaction force over the surface with a 
pre-applied displacement. 
2.2. Factorial analysis by Taguchi robust design 
method 
The Taguchi robust design method is a 
scientifically disciplined tool for conducting and 
evaluating improvements in materials, products, 
equipment, and processes [23]. The purposes of 
these improvements are to enhance the desired 
the verification experiment was performed using 
the optimum parameter level settings and it was 
evaluated by the additive model: 
( )∑

//// , 
where k = the number of design factors, and 
OPTiNS / = the mean NS /  of each design 
factor at the optimal level. 
2.3. Mechanical experiments of pullout strength 
Polyurethane foam (Pacific Research Lab., 
Vashon, WA, USA) with a density of 0.32 g/cm3 
was used in this study. Six types of the body 
cages, which were selected from the L18 
orthogonal array, and one optimum design in the 
situation without bone fusion, which was 
obtained by Taguchi methods, were fabricated. 
The spike of the body cage was implanted into 
two bricks of the polyurethane foam bone. A 
compression force of 200 N which caused by a 
body weight was considered with use of a cable 
wire, pulleys, and counterweights. The body 
cages were pulled out from the foam bones at a 
loading rate of 5 mm/min (Fig. 2B). The 
load-displacement curves were recorded. One 
optimum design and six types of the body cages 
were repeated six times. The maximal force was 
defined as the pullout force. 
3. Results 
Eighteen FE models were constructed in 
accordance with the design variable 
combinations specified in the 18L  orthogonal 
array table. The models with and without bone 
fusion were also discussed. Therefore, thirty-six 
finite element models were created in this study. 
The computational time ranged from 2 to 3 
hours for the models without bone fusion and 
from 2 to 4 hours for the models with bone 
fusion. The convergence of the finite element 
models was achieved by resetting the element 
size controls. The body cages had negligible 
deformation because the osteoporotic bone was 
used (Fig. 3) and the reaction force was evenly 
distributed on the surface. The total reaction 
force of the finite element models was calculated 
and listed in Table 1. The total reaction force for 
the group of models with bone fusion increased 
to an average of 26% over those without bone 
fusion. 
According to the results of the 18L  orthogonal 
array (Table 1), the reaction force was 
transformed into a signal-to-noise ratio where a 
larger value is more desired. Then, the S/N ratio 
plots of the total reaction force at each level of 
every control variable were obtained (shown in 
Fig. 4A and 4B). The results in Fig. 4A (without 
bone fusion) suggested optimum factor level 
settings of 133331 IDSRSOSDSHST , which 
correspond to the pyramidal spike type, a spike 
height of 2 mm, a spike diameter of 2.2 mm, an 
oblique geometry, 11 rows per 28 mm, and an 
inner diameter of 10 mm. The results in Fig. 4B 
(with bone fusion) suggested optimum factor 
level settings of 333332 IDSRSOSDSHST , 
which correspond to the conical spike type, a 
spike height of 2 mm, a spike diameter of 2.2 
mm, an oblique geometry, 11 rows per 28 mm, 
and an inner diameter of 20 mm. 
The ANOVA tables (Table 2 and 3) were 
obtained after performing a data analysis using 
the S/N ratios. From the results of Table 2 
(without bone fusion), the spike row density had 
the highest contribution (57.01%) to the pull out 
strength of the body cage. Following this, the 
descending order of contribution was the spike 
oblique (12.4%), spike height (9.31%), spike 
diameter (7.34%), inner diameter (6.24%), and 
design analysis have proved that increasing the 
number of spike row can increase the pullout 
resistance. In addition, a body cage with oblique 
spikes can also obtain a higher pullout resistance. 
The results of ANOVA showed that the spike 
row has the highest contribution and the spike 
type has the lowest contribution. The reason was 
that increasing the spike row would largely 
increase the contact region between the body 
cage and the vertebrae. However, changing the 
spike type has little or no effect on the pullout 
strength, because the contact area of the 
pyramidal spike type was almost the same as 
compared with that of the conical spike type. 
The clinical implications of a vertebral body 
replacement cage were to provide initial support 
and enhance bone fusion. Modifying the design 
of the body cage can directly improve its clinical 
performance. However, bone fusion can also 
increase the stability of the human spine during 
clinical application. Therefore, the bone fusion 
condition should also be considered in the body 
cage design. Knop et al. compared Synex with 
Harms mesh cage in compression tests. Here 
human cadaveric specimens of intact vertebrae 
were used to measure the compression strength 
of the vertebral body endplate in uniaxial 
loading. They found that the mean ultimate 
compression force of Synex is higher than that 
of Harms mesh cage [1]. According to the 
geometry of these two design body cages, Synex 
had a smaller inner diameter (larger contact 
region) than Harms mesh cage. According to our 
results, although Synex could provide a higher 
mechanical strength, the stability of the human 
spine would be decreased in a situation with 
bone fusion. Rohlmann et al. developed a 
three-dimensional finite element model of the 
lumbar spine with a vertebral body replacement 
at L3 to discuss the different elastic modulus of 
fused bone. This paper concluded that bone 
grafts should be used whenever possible [13]. In 
this study, the total reaction force of the body 
cage in a situation with bone fusion has 
obviously increased by 26 percent on the 
average as compared with that in a situation 
without bone fusion. This implied that this body 
cage was designed not only considering the 
geometry and dimensions of the spike but also 
the fusion condition. Therefore, it has been 
shown that by merely improving the mechanical 
performance of the body cage alone, the fusion 
ability might be compromised. Likewise, the 
reverse is also true. As a result, the mechanical 
performance and the fusion ability need to be 
considered simultaneously for designing a new 
body cage in the future. The better design 
combinations of the body cage were obtained 
after the parametric analysis by Taguchi 
methods. According to the literature, Knöller et 
al. conducted an in vitro biomechanical study to 
evaluate the stability of different types of spinal 
instruments and to discuss the relationship 
between the performances of different 
instrumentation and the bone mineral density. 
The results showed that a single ventral 
instrumentation can provide sufficient rigidity in 
a situation with a high bone mineral density and 
a combined dorsoventral instrumentation can 
provide sufficient rigidity even with poor bone 
density [24]. Therefore, when using the body 
cage to treat spinal diseases, some additional 
instrumentation, such as a side plate, should be 
used in addition to the special design of the body 
cage, especially for a patient with osteoporotic 
bones.

where 1 2z x ix= +  denotes the complex 
coordinate, and ( )zθ  is a complex 
temperature function.  A bar over the variable 
denotes the conjugate of a complex, and a prime 
notation indicates the derivative with respect to 
its argument.  k  and G  denote the heat 
conductivity and elastic shear modulus, 
respectively.  Furthermore, the material 
constants κ  and β  are defined as 
3 4κ ν= −  and (1 )β ν α= +  for plane 
strain, and (3 ) /(1 )κ ν ν= − +  and β α=  
for plane stress, where ν  is Poisson’s ratio, 
and α  is the coefficient of thermal expansion.  
The components of displacements and stresses 
can be expressed in terms of two complex stress 
functions, ( )zΦ  and ( )zΩ , associated with a 
temperature function, ( )zθ , when the thermal 
effect is considered. 
 
2. Temperature field of a trimaterial 
 
Referring to Fig. 1, consider a dissimilar 
triple-layer medium with two perfectly bonded 
interfaces L ( 2 0x = ) and *L ( 2x h= ).  
Suppose that the regions aD ( 2x h> ), 
bD ( 2 0h x> > ), and cD ( 2 0x < ) are 
occupied by materials a , b , and c , 
respectively.   
For the first argument, we regard regions 
aD  and bD  to be composed of the same 
material b  and region cD  of material c .  
If 0 ( )zθ  signifies a potential for a singularity 
in an infinite homogeneous plane of material b , 
then 1( )c zθ , (analytic in cD ) and 1( )zθ  
(analytic in a bD D∪ ) are introduced to satisfy 
the continuity conditions across L  as

The continuity of temperature and total heat flux 
across the interface, L , requires 
 
0 1( )xθ + 1 1( )xθ + 0 1( )xθ + 1 1( )xθ = 1 1( )c xθ +
1 1( )c xθ

ck 1 1( )c xθ - ck 1 1( )c xθ             (6) 
 
Through standard analytic continuation 
arguments it follows that 
 
1( )zθ + 0 ( )zθ = 1( )c zθ , a bz D D∈ ∪  
1( )zθ + 0 ( )zθ = 1( )c zθ , cz D∈                  
(7) 
and 
bk 1( )zθ - bk 0 ( )zθ =- ck 1( )c zθ , 
a bz D D∈ ∪  
- bk 1( )zθ + bk 0 ( )zθ = ck 1( )c zθ , cz D∈                  
(8) 
 
Uncoupling Eqs. (錯誤! 找不到參照來源。) and 
(錯誤! 找不到參照來源。), we obtain 
 
1( )zθ = cbΛ 0 ( )zθ , a bz D D∈ ∪

satisfy the continuity conditions at the interface 
*L , which lies between material a  and b .

Consider the stress field of a dissimilar 
triple-layer medium, with singularities located in 
the middle layer.  (Refer to Fig. 1.)  Similar to

corresponding homogeneous solutions, while 
1( )zΦ , 1( )c zΦ , 1( )zΩ , and 1( )c zΩ  are 
analytic functions.  The continuity of traction

Since the result is based on the assumption that 
cD  is made up of material b , it cannot satisfy 
the continuity condition across L .  
We again assume aD  and bD  are made 
up of the same material b , and region cD  is 
composed of material c .  Additional terms, 
2 ( )zΦ  and 2 ( )zΩ  (analytic in a bD D∪ ) 
with 2 ( )c zΦ  and 2 ( )c zΩ  (analytic in cD ) 
are introduced to satisfy the continuity 
conditions across the interface L .  Similar to

Abstract 
 
 
A general solution for a thermoviscoelastic trimaterial combined with a 
point heat source and a point heat sink is presented in this work.  Based on 
the method of analytic continuation associated with the alternation technique, 
the solutions to the heat conduction and thermoelastic problems for three 
dissimilar, sandwiched media are derived.  A rapidly convergent series 
solution for both the temperature and stress field, expressed in terms of an 
explicit general term of the corresponding homogeneous potential, is obtained 
in an elegant form.  The hereditary integral in conjunction with the 
Kelvin-Maxwell model is applied to simulate the thermoviscoelastic properties, 
while a thermorheologically simple material is considered.  Based on the 
correspondence principle, the Laplace transformed thermoviscoelastic 
solution is directly determined from the corresponding thermoelastic one.  
The real time solution can then be solved numerically by taking the inverse 
Laplace transform.  A typical example concerning the interfacial stresses 
generated from a combined arrangement of a heat source and sink are 
discussed in detail.  The corresponding thin film problem is also discussed.

1. Introduction 
 
The stress analysis of a layered medium has become an important topic in recent 
years because of the steadily increased use of composite materials in many 
engineering applications.  The analysis of the multilayered problem is complicated 
since the solutions must be forced to satisfy the continuity conditions of multiple 
interfaces.  Consequently, the conventional approach to stress analysis for 
multilayered media problems requires the need to solve a system of simultaneous 
equations with a large number of unknown constants.  For example, Iyengar and 
 
2. Temperature field of a trimaterial 
 
Referring to Fig. 1, consider a dissimilar triple-layer medium with two perfectly 
bonded interfaces L ( 2 0x = ) and *L ( 2x h= ).  Suppose that the regions 
aD ( 2x h> ), bD ( 2 0h x> > ), and cD ( 2 0x < ) are occupied by materials a , b , and 
c , respectively.   
For the first argument, we regard regions aD  and bD  to be composed of the 
same material b  and region cD  of material c .  If 0 ( )zθ  signifies a potential for 
a singularity in an infinite homogeneous plane of material b , then 1( )c zθ , (analytic 
in cD ) and 1( )zθ  (analytic in a bD D∪ ) are introduced to satisfy the continuity 
conditions across L  as

Since this result is based on the assumption that region aD  is made up of material b , 
it cannot satisfy the continuity conditions at the interface *L , which lies between

where 0T  denotes the reference temperature.  For the constants of material c ( cD ), 
we have, 
 
cG G= , 0.3ν = ,  ck k= ,  cα α= ,  tλ λ= ,  0tη η= = ,  ( ) 1b T =  
 
The material constants without mention here, except the symmetric terms, are 
assumed to be zero for an isotropic material.  Note that when 0tη η= =  of the 
material a ( aD ) or c ( cD ), it indicates that the material properties of the medium are 
independent of time, or that the medium is assumed to be elastic for the sake of 
simplicity.  In the following cases, let the point heat source be located at 
sz 1 2( ,  / 2)s sx h x h= − = , and the heat sink at kz 1 2( ,  / 2)k kx h x h= = . 
 
Specific Case 1 - When a ( aD ) and c ( cD ) are the Same Material 
Fig. 2 shows the interfacial stresses along 2( 0)L x =  at 0t = , with a cG G= , 
a ck k= , a cα α= , / 1.2c bG G = , / /c b c bk k G G= , and / /c b b cG Gα α = .  It indicates 
that the normal stress is skew-symmetric to the 2x -axis, which becomes positive at 
the heat sink side and negative at the heat source side.  The maximum value of the 
normal stress occurs at 1 / 1.2x h = ± .  Meanwhile, the shear stress is symmetric to 
the 2x -axis and is positive in the region between the heat source and sink.  It also 
shows that the maximum shear stress occurs at 1 / 0.6x h = ± .  Note that the positive 
or negative interfacial stresses depend on the choice of material properties for the 
trimaterial.  Fig. 3 shows the evolution of interfacial normal stresses at points 
1 /x h =0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 2( 0)x = , respectively.  It indicates the normal stresses 
decrease with time because of thermoviscoelastic effects of material b .  Besides, 
the normal stress vanishes at the point 1 /x h =0.  Fig. 4 shows the evolution of 
interfacial shear stresses at points 1 /x h =0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 2( 0)x = .  It indicates 
that the absolute value of the shear stress decreases with time. 
 
Specific Case 2 – The Thin-Film Problem 
The trimaterial problem can be reduced to a finite thickness film/substrate 
problem by letting the upper or lower medium vanish.  Fig. 5 shows the interfacial 
stresses of a film/substrate, assuming 0aG → , 0ak → , and / 1.2c bG G = , 
/ /c b c bk k G G= , / /c b b cG Gα α = .  It shows that the interfacial stresses for the 
film/substrate problem have the same tendency as those in the trimaterial problem 
(comparing to Fig. 2), except that the values of the film/substrate problem (Fig. 5) are 
larger.  This happens because the free surface of the finite thickness film/substrate 
( *L ) is insulated ( 0ak = ), leaving the heat to flow to the substrate, resulting in an 
increase of the temperature on the interface L .  Fig. 6 shows the evolution of 
interfacial stresses of a film/substrate at 1 /x h =0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.  It shows the 
normal stresses decreasing with time at the beginning, and then converging to 
constants after a period of time.  Fig. 7 shows the interfacial shear stresses of a 
film/substrate, which also indicates that the absolute values of the shear stresses
