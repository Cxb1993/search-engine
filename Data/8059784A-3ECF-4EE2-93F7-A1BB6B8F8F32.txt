Abstract 
Given the importance for both transportation and logistics as well as the scope 
of sequencing problems, the focus of this study is the Berth Allocation Problem 
(BAP), which determines the assignment of the berths to the calling ships. Given the 
dynamic information of the ship arrival times, the objective of the dynamic BAP is to 
minimize the total service times, defined as the sum of the waiting times and handling 
times, for all calling ships. In particular, the handling time is assumed to be 
berth-dependent and thus affected by the berth assignment decision. Owing to the 
nature of the sequencing decision problem associated with the BAP, this study 
chooses the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which has some inherited advantages 
over other meta-heuristics due to its sequential framework for the searching process 
and the solution building procedure. This study designs an ant-based algorithm to 
generate the ship assignment sequence, by which a greedy heuristic assigns a berth to 
a ship and determines the berthing window by considering its arrival time and the 
berth-dependent handling time. In the numerical experiment, the developed algorithm 
is compared with a solution algorithm based on Lagrangian Relaxation in the 
literature. It is found that the developed ant-based algorithm is promising with respect 
to the solution quality for the dynamic BAP.

3.1動態離散型船席指派問題之相關研究發展 
Imai et al. (2001)為了改進過去先來先服務(first-come-first-service)的決策方
式，將 DDBAP以混合整數規劃(Mixed Integer Programming, MIP)來定義。目標
式為最小化所有船舶的的等待時間和處理裝卸貨時間，並採用以拉式鬆弛為基礎
的啟發式解法來求解。之後，Nishmura et al. (2001)參考 Imai et al. (2001)，在目
標式相同的情況下，並符合港埠限制之情形，納入可在單一船席服務一艘以上船
舶的可能性，並以基因演算法求解。另外，Imai et al. (2003)考慮有關權重的服務
優先權限制，進一步修正 DDBAP的數學規劃模式，修正目標式為最小化所有船
舶的加權服務時間，其採用基因演算法進行求解。在數值測試中，並探討了包含
不同權重的優先權所產生的影響。 
近年來，多篇研究更積極將更多實務情況納入考量，目標式值也不僅僅是
傳統的形式(諸如像等候時間及處理時間)，也考慮了一些實務性因素。舉例來
說，此外， Imai et al. (2007a)引進具有凹型船席(indented berth)的 DDBAP模式。
基於大型貨櫃船的等待成本較高，應擁有較高的優先順序；因此，在其 DDBAP
的架構中，大型貨櫃船將盡可能地先接受服務。而其求解方式，亦採用基因演算
法求解。Imai et al. (2007b)在船席調派的問題上，額外考慮兩個構面。除了最小
化所有船舶服務時間外，也要檢視其服務水準，透過船舶駛離時間以及船席的使
用績效兩者來進行評估。Hansen et al. (2008)在 DDBAP的架構上，除了考慮等待
時間和裝卸貨時間極小化，也納入了提早和延遲完工等要素做為目標式的一部
分。透過雙目標式的模式建構，採用變動鄰域搜尋法(Variable eighborhood Search, 
VNS)進行求解。最後，Golias et al. (2009)根據船舶的優先權，採用多目標式的
DDBAP以解決船舶服務差異化的問題，並透過基因演算法進行求解。 
 
3.2螞蟻演算法在船席指派問題的應用 
過去文獻中，Nishmura et al. (2001)、Imai et al. (2007)及 Golias et al. (2009)
等多篇研究採用基因演算法求解，可知基因演算法已廣泛被使用於許多型態之船
席指派問題。然而，極少研究使用螞蟻演算法進行求解，本研究相信其可提升對
船席指派問題的求解效能，並開發螞蟻演算法更廣的應用。 
螞蟻演算法在各種組合性最適化問題上成效卓著，其中也包含了許多排序
問題，但過去應用螞蟻演算法於船席指派問題的研究相當稀少，主要僅有兩篇研
究：Tong et al. (1999)、Cheong and Tan (2008)。Tong et al. (1999) 將螞蟻演算法
應用至連續型的 BAP，問題型態與本研究不同；其目標式在儘量減少所需服務
船舶的碼頭長度，亦與一般研究相異。而 Cheong and Tan (2008)則提出了一種多
目標的群聚螞蟻演算法，其中每一隻螞蟻僅負責單一船席如何指派的規劃順序。
在其求解架構中，先以螞蟻演算法導引出一組船舶的指派順序，之後再針對每艘
船舶以另一螞蟻演算法產生出相應的船席。為避免兩螞蟻在演算法上產生干擾，
而本研究則認為一旦產生船舶的指派順序，即可透過一套具系統性的啟發式法則
來產生船舶指派決策。

根據式(1)，目標式為最小化所有船舶的等待時間以及裝卸貨時間。此數學
模式中，會受服務次序 k之影響。然而，相較於開始服務時間而言，此服務次序
k恰好與其相反。也就是說，當 k = 1，代表最後一艘至船席接受服務之船舶，而
當 k = T，也就為第一艘至船席接受服務之船舶。因此式(1)中，考量同一船席對
後續而來之船舶所產生的影響時，處理時間(Cij)與兩接續服務次序的船席閒置時
間(yijk)，在目標式中皆乘上 k，另外再加上船舶抵達時間與船席開始可服務的時
間差，即可得到船舶的總服務時間。限制式(2)在確保每一艘船可以在某船席某
位置下被服務。限制式(3)著重在每船席同時最多提供一艘船舶進行服務。透過
代表閒置時間變數(yijk)的引入，限制式(4)確定船舶為抵達後才接受服務。限制式
(5)表示指派決策為二元變數。限制式(6)則表示船席的閒置時間，必然不小於 0。 
 
五、 研究方法 
由於船席指派問題為 NP-hard 之問題，面臨船舶數量較多時，問題可行解
的空間將變得相當龐大。為了達到縮小搜索空間又兼顧求解品質的前提，本研究
先將求解演算法區分為兩個環節。分別為螞蟻演算法產生船舶服務的指派順序，
以及透過啟發式指派原則產生船席指派決策。 
在 5.1 小節，介紹如何透過螞蟻演算法產生船舶服務的指派順序；主要乃
透過累積之費洛蒙值以及依照 DDBAP所發展的啟發式值，以隨機的方式產生指
派順序。一旦得到指派順序，在 4.2小節仍須將該組船舶的指派順序轉為船席指
派之決策。本研究開發一項啟發式演算方法，稱為貪婪指派規則 (Greedy 
Assignment Rule, GAR)，將該組指派順序，轉為船席指派決策。在得到該組指派
順序的目標式值後，進一步回饋給螞蟻演算法，藉由更新費洛蒙值，以供下一迭
代所使用，進而產生出更佳的指派順序與船席指派決策。 
 
5.1以螞蟻演算法產生指派順序 
螞蟻系統演算法(Ant System Algorithm, ASA)為一具有迭代性的演算法。在
迭代中，模仿螞蟻的搜索行為，產生了不同的解答。這些人工螞蟻選擇路徑的機
率性，乃是參照前一迭代的費洛蒙濃度大小，而有所差異。關於本研究螞蟻演算
法所構築的搜索空間，以及各節點順序的選擇情況，如圖 1所示。螞蟻的搜索空
間係包含「船舶」與「選擇階段」之二維空間。其中，船舶與選擇階段皆等於船
舶的總數。在不同的選擇階段上，n個節點就如同擁有 n艘船舶可供選擇，唯有
兩接續的選擇階段才會進行路徑的連結。 
在建構螞蟻路徑的過程中，關於節點隨機選取的相關數學式，說明如下。
假設某螞蟻在迭代 t、第 m階段位於某一節點 i，選擇要走向下一節點 j的選擇機
率如式(7)；其中，除了費洛蒙之外，也納入考量問題特性的啟發式值。式(8)則
表示每一迭代的費洛蒙值更新，前半段乃指迭代費洛蒙值的蒸發情況，後半段則
6 
 
根據式(7)，費洛蒙值與啟發式值越大，越會增加路徑選擇的可能性。此外，
尚需考量費洛蒙值與啟發式值的權重關係，分別為、。另外，仍須透過 Q、
兩參數架構好整體求解機制。使得螞蟻會依據先前的求解經驗，選擇可能較短之
路徑。另一方面，仍有選擇其他路徑之可能性，避免陷入區域最佳解。 
另外，在建構螞蟻路徑產生指派順序部份；首先，本研究先假設存在一個
虛無起點，作為第一階段前之路徑選擇起始點。爾後於每個階段都會選擇到不同
的船舶作為路徑下一階段的節點，直至所有階段的選擇皆完成。之後，再將這個
路徑做為一組指派順序，交由下一部分的貪心指派法則進行求解作業。以圖 1
例子為例，十艘船舶的指派順序為 1-2-5-3-4-10-8-9-6-7。 
最後，關於螞蟻演算法的設計，如何設定啟發式值亦是相當關鍵的要素。
若以過去 TSP之研究而言，啟發式值通常是為路徑 i to j之倒數，可藉此吸引螞
蟻選擇鄰近節點繼續前進。基於 DDBAP的特性，本研究納入船舶的抵達時間作
為參考因素；如式(10)，啟發式值可大略視為兩船舶抵達時間差之倒數。然而，
還需透過 b1與 b2進行調整，以處理兩船舶抵達時間差為零或負數之情況。一般
來說，一旦下一階段船舶 j與本階段的船舶 i的抵達時間越接近，啟發式值就會
越高，船舶 j便更有機會被選取。透過求解所累積經驗的費洛蒙值以及船舶抵達
時間差的啟發式值，希望將可以得出一組理想的指派順序。

5.2以貪婪指派規則進行求解 
延續上一節的指派順序。若是就螞蟻演算法求解 TSP而言，一旦產生螞蟻
的路徑即是解答；然而，本研究中，一旦有了指派順序後，還需要設計出在該順
序下，如何產生相應的船席指派與接受服務的時間。值得注意的是，本研究中的
船舶處理時間與船席位置相關；另外，也須要確保各船席現有船舶已處理結束
後，才能進行新船的停泊服務。以下，在最小化船舶的等待時間及處理時間的目
標下，本研究提出了兩個版本的貪婪指派規則(Greedy Assignment Rule, GAR)：
GAR1與 GAR2。 
根據 GAR1，並以圖 1 的指派順序 1-2-5-3-4-10-8-9-6-7 為例，船舶 1 首先
被指派至船席，而船舶 2以及船舶 5亦已陸續被指派，如圖 2。在考慮第四艘船
(船舶 3)的指派時，其服務船席的選擇機制乃是依照各船席處理時間及等待時間
之總和最小者，進行指派。以圖 2為例，假如船席 1至船席 3的等待時間以及處
理時間的總和分別是(2+12)=14、(8+15)=23以及 (0+18)=18，船舶 3將會被指派
至船席 1接受服務。 
然而，GAR2 的方式，則不同於 GAR1 一次挑選單一船舶的指定船席，改
採一次選定接續兩次序的船舶進行考量。仍舊以圖 2做說明，若現在針對第 4、
第 5順序(船舶 3、船舶 4)進行指派作業，因有 3個船席，所以有 32種組合，仍
擇其最優者作為選取的船席組合。但需注意的是，最後只先確認第一次序的船席

題中皆為 10%。 
 
圖 3 求解演算法之流程示意圖 
船舶的抵達時間亦為隨機產生，其服從平均值為 300 的指數分配。因此，
船舶的抵達情況將會集中於前期，使得船席指派上容易有阻塞之情況；當然，船
舶集中前期抵達的前況，仍會明顯有別於靜態 BAP 的情境。本研究相信如此題
的情境假設，將相較於抵達時間平均分散於各時段之研究更具挑戰性，船席之選
用決策也將更具影響力。 
參數設定方面，本研究設定初始費洛蒙為 1、迭代消散比率為 0.1、費洛蒙
值與啟發值兩者的權重比為 1.5。其中，有關每一迭代的螞蟻數量以及螞蟻每隻
所帶有的費洛蒙值，由於問題規模將大大影響求解的搜索空間，本研究因而設定
每一迭代的螞蟻數量為船舶數/2，提高大規模例題的搜尋。而螞蟻每隻所帶有的
費洛蒙值則為 100*船舶數，以因應大規模例題的路徑長度。 
此外，本研究所發展演算法與 Imai et al. (2001)當中的拉式鬆弛法進行比
較。於問題規模大小為 25 艘船、75 艘船以及 150 艘船時，GAR2 能顯著優於

個人所發表論文是屬於以台灣的研究標的的實證研究，所獲得的結果與類似文獻大致上是一致

Revenue Management (RM) has become a common practice in the airline industry worldwide since 
American Airlines successfully implemented it in the mid 1980s to beat the entrants in the 
post-deregulation era. As a core technique of RM, price differentiation is put into practice though the 
multi-fare scheme, which results in significant price dispersion in the market. At the same time, the 
implementation of price differentiation is believed to be closely related to market condition. The objective 
of this study is thus to examine the relationship between revenue management and market condition 
through the example of the domestic air market in Taiwan. This empirical study establishes several 
multiple linear regression models, in which ticket discount is chosen as the dependent variable given the 
partially-deregulated environment for fare control. With an aim to conduct a comparative analysis, it is 
found that the result is in general consistent with those in the prior empirical studies focusing on the U.S. 
and Europe domestic air markets and provide more evidence from the practical viewpoint regarding how 
airlines react to market condition while making the pricing decision. In particular, this study further 
employs two interaction models to investigate the impact of one independent variable on another. The 
results show that the interaction models provide insightful explanations about how the implementation of 
RM is affected by other factors. 
四、建議

教師也可以考慮採用(部分)英語教學，以提升英文使用的熟練度。 
2. 此次會議發現，不少研究係由跨國的研究人員共同完成。香港理工大學不僅有為數眾多的外

進行短期的教學和研究。基於背景、經驗上的不同，可以激盪出許多新構想，也可以將資源
與經驗截長補短。國內也應該強化國際合作與交流，效法鄰近國家的作法，投入更多資源，

INNOVATION AND APPLICATION FOR THE FUTURE

price-elastic demands. This combined with the sophisticated computer reservation system for seat 
inventory control successfully defeated the low-price strategy of People Express and, at the same time, 
effectively secured the high-margin market for American Airlines. People Express, a new company 
without a high-end brand image, ceased operations in 1986 after losing its price advantage (Peterson 
and Glab, 1994). 
 
Airline Deregulation has been cited as a success for free competition. Initially, the average airfare did 
decrease, and the number of airline passengers increased. However, after years of practice under the 
“Open Sky”, many airlines have declared bankruptcy. The projection is for a handful of large airlines 
to dominate the airline industry in the future. There are several reasons why the Airline Deregulation 
did not live up to its advance billing or ended up with so many surprises as highlighted by Alfred E. 
Kahn (1988), an economist and the last Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). However, 
price discrimination and other revenue management techniques, the key weapon used by American 
Airlines to defeat People Express, have certainly played a key role in the unexpected and undesired 
market concentration. 
 
Although controversial, revenue management (RM, also known as yield management, YM) has 
become a global and common practice in the airline industry worldwide since American Airlines 
successfully implemented it in the mid 1980s to beat the entrants in the post-deregulation era. Not 
only is a strategic measure for price competition, RM is also an important operational technique for 
raising revenue. It has been estimated that RM practices have generated an additional revenue of 1.4 
billion USD for American Airlines over a 3-year period around 1988 (Smith et al., 1992). Nowadays, 
it is difficult for a major airline to operate profitably without the use of RM, as according to most 
estimates that the extra revenue gained from the use of RM is about 4 - 5%, which is comparable to 
many airlines’ total profitability in a good year (Talluri & van Ryzin, 2004). 
 
Airline deregulation has become a global trend, and Sinha (2001) and Chang et al. (2004) serve as 
excellent references for its development across countries and regions. In particular, the latter focused 
on the issue of ownership and control, which is believed to be the most important barrier for airline 
industry linearization. There were many research works that have examined the impact of 
deregulation specifically on airfare, which is probably the most immediate and concerned influence of 
linearization. For example, Morrison and Winston (1990), Borenstein (1992), Dresner and Tretheway 
(1992), Maillebiau and Hansen (1995), Marin (1995), Jorge-Calderon (1997) focused on the markets 
in North American or Europe, the regions with early introduction of aviation deregulation. More 
recently, for the Asia Pacific region, Manuela (2007) adopted a similar empirical framework and 
developed an econometric model for the case of Philippines. 
 
Above research works have shown that airfare, in terms of the average value, generally decreased due 
to the competition brought by deregulation, but they did not address another important aspect: the 
price dispersion due to the application of the price discrimination, which is legally permissible and 
strategically desirable in the post-deregulation era. Price discrimination, one of the core techniques of 
RM, is implemented by offering multiple airfares with various terms and conditions and/or by 
changing the fares dynamically. Its application is believed to be affected by the market condition. 
Thus, the focus of this empirical study is to analyze the relationship between price discrimination, 
revenue management, and market condition. This paper is organized as follows. The next section 
reviews the related literature. The framework of the empirical analysis is described in the third section, 
and the results are presented in the fourth section. Finally, the findings of this study are summarized 
and conclusions are drawn in the fifth section. 
 
2.  Literature Review 
 
Price discrimination is usually categorized in three types (Varian, 1996). In the first-degree price 
discrimination, also known as perfect price discrimination, a supplier sets the price according to the 
willingness-to-pay by individual consumers. In the second-degree price discrimination, consumers 
make the purchase decision regarding the options offered by a supplier. That is why it is sometimes

Airfare was once again used as the dependent variable, and the key independent variables (Saturday-
night stay-over, advance purchase, and market concentration represented by the HHI) remained the 
same. However, they introduced several new independent variables (such as the presence of low-cost 
carriers) to reflect the unique situation in the European market. Although the study area was 
geographically smaller, and the deregulation movement was slightly later, the results obtained by 
Giaume and Guillou (2004) focusing on Europe were similar to those of Stavins (2001) for the U.S. In 
particular, the signs for the coefficients of the major variables in the regression models were found to 
be the same, although the coefficient of determination (R2) was lower (0.40 in Giaume and Guillou, 
2004 vs. 0.77 in Stavins, 2001). 
 
A local version of the “Open Sky” policy was initiated in Taiwan in 1987, and several new airlines 
were established to serve the domestic airline market, which was experiencing an unprecedented 
demand. However, fare was still under a very strict control scheme, under which tickets were sold at 
the fixed published fare. Only until 1994, airlines were authorized for the first time to adjust the ticket 
price within 10% of the published fare, and this permissible range was expanded several times later on. 
The fare-control regulations were further revised in 1999 such that the published fare became a price 
cap, and airlines were allowed to set a certain level of discount. Although several minor revisions 
have been made, the current regulations basically follow the form of the 1999 version (CAA, 2012). 
 
To some extent, Taiwan has been following the global trend to deregulation, and the airlines gradually 
adopted the concept of revenue management. However, the liberalized domestic airline market in 
Taiwan was quite different from most markets in the literature. Taiwan is geographically a small 
country and has good infrastructure for most part of the island, but jet aircrafts (such as A320s, MD-
80/MD-90s, B737s, and even B757s) are anyway used to serve many domestic routes. In addition, the 
fare regulations for the domestic airline market were only partially deregulated. Thus, it is of great 
interest to conduct an empirical study to examine the relationship between price discrimination and 
market condition and to conduct a comparative analysis with respect to different markets. 
 
3.  Framework of Empirical Analysis 
 
Following the framework in Stavins (2001) and Giaume and Guillou (2004), this study established 
four linear regression models to perform the empirical analysis. The flights included in the analysis 
were operated by three airlines, Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT), TransAsia Airways (TNA), and 
UNI AIR (UNI), for the routes from Taipei, the capital and the economic center, to seven domestic 
airports. The basic information and the market condition of the routes are listed in Table 1. Given the 
airlines and the routes considered, the traffic volume included in the analysis accounted for 65% of 
the overall domestic airline traffic in Taiwan, or 82% of the traffic leaving or bound for Taipei in 
terms of the number of passengers (CAA, 2004). The information regarding the flights for a typical 
weekday in 2004 (Tuesday, August 10) was collected to serve as the data for the regression models 
from the website of a popular on-line travel agent, in which the above-mentioned airlines are suppliers 
for the domestic air markets. 
 
Based on the fare-control regulations under the partially-deregulated scheme, an airline can discount 
fares within a regulated range for the flights it operates. Therefore, the discount for each flight was 
used as the dependent variable in all four models, and it was defined as (published fare - discount 
fare)/published fare (in percent). This dependent variable is different from the one (the airfare) used in 
Stavins (2001) and Giaume and Guillou (2004). 
 
As for the independent variables, the RM technique for price discrimination and the market condition 
were considered first. Taiwanese carriers do not use a complicated RM system for the domestic 
market, and they deal with the diverse demand simply by dynamically adjusting the price, a practice 
adopted by many low cost carriers worldwide. The price offered on-line remains the same from the 
beginning of the booking period to five days before departure. The price then subsequently increases 
and becomes the published fare on the day of departure. Given this price adjusting scheme, the 
number of days for advance purchase was taken as one of the key independent variables in the 
 6
first variable, representing the days for advance purchase, and the two airline dummy variables were 
introduced into the model as (4).

4.  Results of Regression Models  
 
Based on the collected data, the results of the regression models are listed in Table 2. The summary 
and the discussion of the results are presented as follows.

The basic model is not very satisfactory, since its R2 is only 0.498. However, the t-statistics of both 
independent variables (the number of days for advance-purchase and the HHI) are large, indicating 
that the relation between ticket discount and each of these two dependent variables is significant. As 
expected to be positive, the coefficient of the variable ADV shows that the advance-purchase discount 
is about 2.21% per day. 
 
The coefficient of the other independent variable HHI is 12.26%, and its positive sign indicates that 
the more concentrated a market is, the higher the ticket discount is. This result probably does not 
support the standard notion that market concentration raises fare level, or it is not in agreement with 
the conclusion in the first empirical study (Borenstein and Rose, 1994) that competitive-type price 
discrimination prevails over monopoly-type price discrimination. However, it is consistent with the 
results of the two later empirical studies, Stavins (2001) and Giaume and Guillou (2004). 
 
Stavins (2001) did not discuss the cause of this result, but Giaume and Guillou (2004) provided an 
explanation in light of the unique features of the European air market. Airline deregulation in Europe 
had not come into effect for a long time, and there was a significant market share inequality for many 
routes. For example, in a duopoly market, it is common that one of the players is a large (flag-carrying 
national) airline and the other one is a small (new) regional airline. In that market the associated HHI 
are very high. Lowering the price appears to be the best strategy for the big one to drive out the new 
comer and for the small one to penetrate the crucial new market. Thus, the average fares are likely to 
lower than those in the markets with comparable market share among players.

objective of this study is to conduct an empirical study to examine the relationship between revenue 
management and the market condition, based on the example of the domestic airline market in Taiwan. 
The study established four linear regression models to conduct this empirical study. Ticket discount 
was chosen as the dependent variable given the partially-deregulated environment for fare control. 
 
The basic model, consisting of only the independent variables related to revenue management 
(advance purchase) and market condition (HHI), was found to be insufficient. After introducing four 
more variables, the enhanced model was better able to explain the pricing decision of the airlines. 
Based on the first interaction model, the discount for advance purchase was reduced if market 
concentration increases. With an aim to conduct a comparative analysis, it has been found that the 
result is in general consistent with those in the prior empirical studies earlier empirical studies 
focusing on other areas (Stavins, 2001; Giaume and Guillou, 2004). In the second interaction model, a 
specific airline (UNI AIR) was identified by its aggressive role in the implementation of revenue 
management. We believe this study provides more evidence from the practical viewpoint regarding 
the pricing decision of the airlines under the influence of RM and market condition 
 
During the past several years, there has been a critical impact on the domestic airline industry in 
Taiwan: the high-speed rail, which was inaugurated on January 5th, 2007. The maximum speed of the 
trains is 300 kilometers per hour and the frequency of the service is high. The high-speed rail system 
carried 15.56 millions passengers for the first year, and the rate of growth is very promising (THSRC, 
2012). All the domestic airline services for the west coast have been terminated thereafter. The 
business environment of the domestic airline market in Taiwan has been changed permanently. The 
airlines now have to focus on the services for the east coast and the offshore islands, where alternative 
transportation services are not competitive. An analysis of the pricing decisions of the airlines for 
these routes can be an extension to this study, but the issue must also be addressed from a public 
domain point of view. Government intervention is required for these potentially unprofitable routes, 
as the mobility of the people living in those remote areas should be protected.
