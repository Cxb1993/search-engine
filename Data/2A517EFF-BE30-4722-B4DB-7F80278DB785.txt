用戶的QoS要求，同時也浪費無線網路系統有限
的資源。
因此於有限的無線網路系統資源下，面對大
量增加的無線網路流量與用戶的移動性，要保證
不同類型連線的服務品質與傳輸信號品質，無線
網路的功率控制、流量控制、與網路資源管理的
整合學理研究，以達用戶及網路系統的最佳效
用，是個相當熱門且重要的研究主題。
本計畫的研究重點主要在基地台與網路
間，對於有彈性的QoS之連線，做適應多層的頻
寬分配設計。其整合基地台之網路頻寬分配及無
線用戶間的錯誤隱藏演算法，來達到有彈性的
QoS；使無線網路系統的頻寬使用作動態最佳化
分配，以進一步提升網路系統的多工使用效率
(Multiplexing Gain)。
而在逐漸擁擠的無線通訊網路裡，一個重要
的無線語音傳輸課題，是如何在低位元率傳輸
下，仍能保有高品質之語音。另一重要課題為語
音之傳輸位元率須隨網路流量及無線通道之狀
況而適應性更改。而使用者之移動性及無線通道
之多重路徑衰減，更加深了這些問題的困難度。
上述之困難點皆是此計劃探討及解決之課題。
此計畫將針對現今實際之整合性的有線及
無線網路架構，設計並提出一可行之適應性多層
頻寬配置演算法。此系統會根據現在實際的網路
使用狀況，動態調整使用者的頻寬配置，以便及
時改善整個系統的服務品質。此子計劃同時也考
慮了以分封交換為基礎之無線網路電話系統
(wireless VoIP)，針對已經漏失封包的語音信號，
建立一多取樣率狀態空間生成模型，然後發展出
一套多取樣率最佳化狀態估測理論，來解決語音
重建估測器的最佳化設計問題，以期改善其因封
包漏失所造成的品質下降。
此計劃案提出一個多取樣率無線網路電話
系統。該系統使用“封包交錯”之方法，來將欲
傳送之語音封包化。而接收端則利用一最佳化語
音重建估測器來減輕封包漏失所造成的品質下
降程度，以期達到良好之網路服務品質。針對前
述之無線網路系統上，此計劃案亦提出一適應性
多重頻寬配置演算法。該系統將根據現在實際的
頻寬使用量及使用者之改變狀況，隨時調整每個
使用者的頻寬配置，以便及時改善整個系統的服
務品質。
參與本研究計劃的人員，在研究過程中，對
於無線通訊系統、適應性頻寬配置、無線網路電
話、最佳化狀態估測理論、多取樣率數位訊號處
理及語音重建估測器將有更深入的認知。同時對
於如何將多取樣率語音系統的觀念與數位估測
理論的技巧結合，以使對無線網路電話系統能有
更進一步的研究，將是有所裨益。
三、研究方法
1. Introduction
1.1 Voice over Wireless Networks
Wireless Internet should allow introduction of
multimedia in cellular networks, which are voice
oriented. Mobility of the users and different traffic types
are temptation for the introduction of quality of support
in wireless IP environment. The features of IP, under the
conditions in cellular networks and additional
classification of the traffic, are the key element. QoS in
packet networks is considered by admission control at
the start of a call and QoS mechanisms for QoS support
during its lifetime.
Figure 1: Next-generation wireless network architecture
We are facing extremely fast development of
mobile community in the recent years. Similar trend has
Intemet, as one of fastest growing technologies ever so.
Intemet has the advantage that it simply integrates the
delivery of every kind of information to the end users.
The base for the Intemet is Intemet Protocol (IP).
Simplicity of IP as a key feature, and its power to capture
everything, make it robust to every medium. Therefore,
IP is going to be introduced in the telecommunications,

where the long-delay prediction coefficients ,j the
approximate pitch period M , and the covariance Q of
the driving noise )(kv must be estimated by some
speech analysis technique. For the purpose of
computational consideration, a small number of taps
)3~1( q is always used in the long-delay synthesis
filter. The delays associated with these taps are bunched
around the pitch lag value which range from 2.5 to 15 ms
for almost human speech.
The conventional frame-based linear predictive
techniques regard speech as a piecewise-stationary
random signal. Hence, the model parameters j , M
and Q in the long-delay synthesis system (1) are
assumed piecewise time-invariant; i.e., they are constants
in an analysis frame and become another set of constants
in the next analysis frame. The system functions of the
long-delay predictor in a frame can be expressed as

where the short-delay prediction coefficients i must

usually estimated by a frame-based linear predictive
technique. Hence, the system function of the short-delay
predictor in a frame can be expressed as

where the predictor order p is typically less than 16,
depending on the application. In addition, the intervals of
the analysis frames for the short-delay and long-delay
synthesis filters should match with each other to obtain
an adequate two-stage composite speech generation
model.
The short-delay predictor )(zPs removes the
near-sample correlation of the speech signal )(kx . The
resulting prediction residual )(kd is a low-density
quasi-periodic signal consisting of mainly of pitch spikes.
The long-delay predictor )(zPd removes the
distant-sample correlation of the residual signal. If the
pitch period is an integral number of samples, a one-tap
long-delay predictor (i.e., 1q ) can adequately remove
the pitch period correlations. For non-integral pitch
periods, a multi-tap long-delay predictor (i.e., 1q )
serves somewhat as an interpolating filter for the
removal of these distant-sample correlations. The value
of the pitch lag M is constant in an analysis frame and
usually chosen so as to maximize the long-delay
prediction gain.
The success of the long-delay predictor depends on
the short-delay prediction residual )(kd having
adjacent pitch pulses which are similar in shape. If the
short-delay predictor varies significantly from frame to
frame, the pitch pulses may differ in detail. For short
formant frames, the short-delay predictor coefficients
may change significantly from a former frame to its next
frame just due to the asynchronism between the frames.
This observation concludes that a short formant frame
size is not suitable for the two-stage AR speech modeling.
As the demonstration of the earlier paper that the overall
prediction gain (short-delay + long-delay prediction gain)
remains high at the slow formant update rate 20
ms/frame. Hence, slow formant update rate is preferred
since they involve less computation and require a smaller
bandwidth for transmission.
A possible further consideration is the minimum
phase property of the short-delay prediction error filter
)(1)( zPzH ss  and long-delay prediction error filter
)(1)( zPzH dd  . If they are minimum-phase, the
corresponding speech synthesis filter )()(/1 zHzH ds
used in the representation of the two-stage AR
generation model (1) and (3) is stable. Generally, the

2.3 Multirate State-Space Model
The speech measurements ,...}2,,0),({ LLkky  of
the multirate system Fig.2 are obtained at a reduced
sampling rate owing to the effect of the decimation and
expansion operations. Hence, the speech generation
process (9) must be modified to a multirate state-space
model. The speech samples )(kx are considered now to
be available at the rate M out of L samples
( LM 0 ), where M is constant over a segment of
speech signals. The missing samples are caused by the
packet loss and they are lost at regular positions due to
the effect of the packet interleaving scheme.
For the purpose of simplification, we derive the
multirate state-space model of the speech signal for the
special case 1M in the following equations.
However, we can extend these equations to the general
case 1M . A multirate representation of the speech
sequence ,...}4,2,0),({ kkx with decimation factor
2L can be derived from (9) as follows

The representation of the decimated speech signal )(kx
in (12) is a multirate state-space model since the desired
speech signal )(kx is driven by L different inputs at
L sequential time points; however, only a single output
)(kx is generated at the last time point.
Finally, including the corrupting noise )(kn into
the state-space model (12), a multirate representation of
the noisy, decimated speech measurement )(ky can be
described by the following state-space model

The statistical framework of the block driving noise
)(kLv is investigated in the following paragraph. By
taking the expectation on outer product of the block
driving noise )(kLv at different time points and using
the zero-mean, white characteristics of the driving noise
)(kv in (1), the block driving noise )(kLv is found
to possess the following white and diagonal covariance

is uncorrelated with the block driving noise )(kLv .
Since the state vector )(kz in (14) at iLk  also
contains the missing speech samples iLkkx ),( as
entries, the design problem of the speech reconstruction
estimator of Fig.2 can be alternately described as follows:
Given the noisy, decimated speech sequence

state-space model (14) as information, the filtering and
interpolation of the desired speech signal
,...}2,1,0),({ kkx are accomplished by estimating the
state vector )(kz and extracting the speech sample
estimates from these state estimates. The transformed
problem is then how to obtain the state estimate )(ˆkz in
an adequate statistical sense.

The problem of providing adaptive QoS in a
wireless network would be similar to that in its wired
counterpart if we do not consider user mobility. In a
wireless network, a user may move across different cells
or administration domains. Thus, we have to consider the
user-perceived QoS not only during his stay in a single
cell, but in all cells he may traverse throughout the
connection lifetime. Moreover, the potential dropping
due to such cell crossings (i.e., handoffs) has to be taken
into account.
The forced-termination (or dropping) probability is
a widely used metric to represent the compromise of QoS
due to user mobility. This probability should be made as
small as possible because admitting a user and then
terminating his session before its completion would
make the user even unhappier. In order to reduce this
probability, many admission control algorithms give
handoff users priority over new users. In contrast to the
proposals which use fixed bandwidth allocation, adaptive
bandwidth allocation can be also used to further reduce
the forced-termination probability.
We consider a wireless network in which the base
station takes charge of both admission control and
bandwidth allocation for mobile users in its cell. While
residing in the cell of a base station, a mobile user
communicates with others via that base station. A
“wireless network” can be a conventional celular phone 
network or an office building with interconnected IEEE
802.11 wireless LANs.
As mentioned previously, we give handoff users
priority over new users since dropping a handoff user is
usually less desirable and less tolerable than blocking
new users. This is achieved by restricting a new user into
the cell once the total number of users or the total
occupied bandwidth exceeds a prespecified threshold.
Handed-off and newly initiated users are treated equally
once they are admitted into a cell.
Assume that the “multilevel bandwidth alocation 
scheme” is designed to have K different quality levels. 
The bandwidth requirement of the ith quality level is
denoted as iW and the following relation
min1max WWWWW Ki  is satisfied. With such a
degree of freedom, a base station may try to degrade the
quality levels of some existing users in order to admit
more users so as to improve the overall system
performance. In a system with degradable QoS, a user
may receive different levels of QoS during the entire
duration of his connection, depending on the loads of
cells he traverses. Even if a user receives the highest
level of QoS when he is admitted to a cell, the QoS may
still be degraded when some other base stations on his
“path” decide to degrade his QoS in order to accept more 
users.
四、計劃成果自評
From the users’ perspectives, this may raise two 
important questions: 1) How long does his connection
stay at each individual QoS level? 2) How often does the
received QoS switch between these levels? Therefore,
two QoS metrics associated with these questions,
degradation ratio and upgrade/degrade frequency, are
defined as follows: (1) Degradation ratio (DR): The
fraction of time a user receives degraded QoS. Since we
consider a multilevel QoS system, DR is defined as


(19)
where it is assumed that a user receives level-i QoS for
iT seconds. (2) Upgrade/degrade frequency (UDF). The
frequency of changing the QoS level an admitted user
receives. These two metrics, along with the probability
of blocking new users and the probability of dropping
handoff users, will be the key performance metrics.
When a fair degradation algorithm is used, the
probability that a user’s QoS wil be degraded increases 
(and so does the value of UDF), while using an unfair
algorithm ensures a lower value of UDF. This tradeoff
needs to be made when the bandwidth degradation
algorithm is chosen and will be investigated more
thoroughly. The upgrade algorithm should be applied
when a QoS level-i user leaves the cell such that an
