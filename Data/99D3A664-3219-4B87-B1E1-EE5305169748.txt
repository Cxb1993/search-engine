 as the narrow band interference (NBI).  On the other 
hand, for the receiver of the WDMA signals, the 
OCDMA signals will be viewed as the wide band 
interference (WBI) as shown in Fig. 3.  We will 
discuss how to suppress the narrow band interference 
caused by the WDMA signals in next section.

WDMA channels are overlaid in the same spectral region . 
III. Hybrid OCDMA/WDMA system 
with the position code 
As mentioned before, the OCDMA system is 
mainly used in the transmission of the LANs.  Its 
data rate is limited by the low repetition rate of the 
ultrashort light pulse source, and its capacity depends 
on the length of the phase code.  We also know that 
many timeslots will be wasted.  So, we would like to 
design a new structure to utilize other timeslots 
efficiently as shown in Fig. 4.  We utilize some 
optical devices such as the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) 
which can separate one broadband light pulse into 
some sub-pulses with different bandwidths.  Hence, 
we may reuse other timeslots for encoding so that the 
capacity and the data rate may be enhanced.  We call 
this process as the position coding. 
A position encoder and a decoder are inserted in 
Fig. 1, as shown in Fig. 4.  We will discuss their 
compositions in next subsection.  First, the 
ultrashort light pulse goes through the position 
encoder and is divided into some sub-pulses.  Then, 
each sub-pulse is encoded by a pulse shaping 
apparatus which generates the phase code.  After we 
finish two encoding processes, the optical signal goes 
into the network.  It combines with the signals from 
other users via the star coupler on the fiber.  Thus, 
the signal will be jammed by the MAI in the fiber 
network.  There will be a phase decoder and 
position decoder in the receiver. 
 
 
Fig. 4  The OCDMA system with the position code. 
Because each sub-pulse is located on different 
bands, we view them as independent to each other as 
shown in Fig. 5.  First, we take only one sub-pulse 
into consideration and obtain its bit error rate.  Then, 
we combine other sub-pulses with the position code.  
In this way, we make sure that each sub-pulse has a 
specific timeslot for its position.  Hence, the 
detection device must determine in which timeslot 
each sub-pulse is so that the best performance will be 
achieved. 
 
Fig. 5  Example for the position code. 
An FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) is a variation in 
the longitudinal direction (direction of propagation) 
of the fiber core.  For single mode fiber, an FBG 
will couple light in the fundamental mode 
propagating in the forward direction into light in the 
fundamental mode in the backward direction, 
provided the Bragg condition 
( the Bragg wavelength 2 effn= Λ ) is satisfied, where 
effn  is the effective mode index of the fiber and 
Λ is the grating period.  Thus, an FBG functions as 
a wavelength selective filter. 
    The spectral characteristics of an FBG depend 
on the actual refractive index modulation which in 
turn can incorporate various features such as 
apodization and phase-shifts.  Furthermore, by 
 can be neglected.  Without loss of generality, we 
assume that the OCDMA user 1 is the desired signal 
and all other OCDMA users will produce 
multi-access interference (MAI).  The WDMA users 
can be viewed, from OCDMA user 1’s standpoint, as 
narrow-band interference (NBI).  At receiver, we 
also consider each OCDMA sub-pulse from the 
position code and each sub-pulse received can be 
represented as 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )sub pulse MA NBR t s t i t i t− = + +     (1) 
We assume that we will separate the ultrashort 
light pulse into λ  sub-pulses by the FBG, and the 
bandwidth becomes W/λ  in ideal case, where W  is 
the bandwidth of the ultrashort light pulse.  Because 
each sub-pulse is in the different bands, we may view 
them as independent to each other.  Thus, we 
assume that the mathematical model ( )A ω  of each 
sub-pulse is

The signal ( )G t  is a real envelope function 
which determines the temporal width of the encoded 
pulse by the phase coding and is independent of code 
elements.  ( )V t  is a periodic pseudo-noise signal 
with period 1/2T π= Ω  and depends on the code 
elements nϕ . 
   Because of the FBG, we know that the duration of 
each sub-pulse will become cλτ  where cτ  is the 
duration of the ultrashort light pulse, but the number 
of the timeslots will not be changed as shown in Fig. 
10.

( )pV t  and ( )pI t  represent a periodic train of each

    We further generalize the expression given in (7) 
by including two statistically independent random 
variables, namely 't  and η , with probability 
density function ( )' 'tP t  and ( )Pη η , respectively, 
associated with ambiguities in the transmission time 
and the initial phase of the encoded light.  ( )' 'tP t  is 
defined on the interval ( )' '2, 2T T−  where 
'T T≤ , and ( )Pη η  is defined on the interval

and are defined accordingly as
