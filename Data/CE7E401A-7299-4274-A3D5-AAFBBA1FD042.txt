consequently those of mullets. Seasonal variation of the distribution of PCBs on surface sediments 
help us to establish the link between surface sediment and bottom dwellers. 
In addition to the seasonal variation, variation of PCB concentration among habitat also has 
confirmed that the source of PCBs in biota was originally from the sediment. The PCB body 
burden of collected fish samples was proportional to the contamination level of their locations. 
Using the less chlorinated PCB fraction (triCB + tetraCB) / total PCBs as the indicator of the 
origins of PCBs, fish near former contaminated areas had greater body burdens of the more 
chlorinated PCB congeners, while the farmed fish exhibited a PCB pattern more like that known 
to originate from air-water exchange with less chlorinated PCBs predominating. The deviation of 
concentration and congener profile in the three habitats indicates that these variations are 
attributed to their habitats, and sediment was the most possible source of PCBs to fish. 
In the application of SPME, a 16.5 um polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated glass fiber was 
applied to detect the aqueous equivalent content (AEC) of polychlorinated biphenyls in field 
collected samples. AEC ratios of fish/water, fish/ sediment and sediment/water are applied to 
elucidate differences of potentials among the compartments. Indicated by the direction of potential 
gradients the bottom sediment was the source of contaminant in this estuary, and PCBs moved 
from buried sediment to surface sediment, to water column and finally to the biota. The SPME 
approach is able to rapidly and accurately determine the direction of the transferring of pollutants 
among environmental compartments, and will facilitate the assessment of the biological and 
human health risks posed by pollutants in the environment. 
The fishes in this estuary included the bottom dwellers such as C. chanos, M cephalus, L. 
macrolepis, N. come and A. maculates, and some pelagic dwellers such as M. cyprinoides, E.

in fishes, thus the model can employ the ratio to predict the body burden of biota with known 
PCBs in referenced level’s biota and the trophic level of target biota. The predicted formula, 
TLPCBs  0.25  2.86  log +=  (r2 = 0.90), reveals the feasibility of our assumptions and prediction 
from our model in measured fishes. The magnifying ratios of PCB congeners with log KOW 
smaller than 7.0 found in this study are similar to the findings in Gobas et al. (1993), but are 
smaller than those from Gobas for those very hydrophobic congeners, which was attributed to the 
fugacity measured from Gobas was from the fecae rather from the tissue and leading to a 
overestimation of magnifying ratio. Therefore, this approach is able to estimate the probably 
highest fugacity in fishes with the known fugacity of sediment and provided a conservative 
prediction. 
The simplified fugacity model is able to estimate the fugacity of individual congeners 
through the mass balance principles and reaction rate equations. Dominant mechanism involved in 
the uptake and excretion of PCBs in fish were employed, including uptake from gill respiration 
and dietary source, dilution through growth, excretion and biotransformation. The net balance of 
these reaction resulted in the accumulation in fishes. The predicted fugacity is slightly less than 
the observed ones for majority of the studied congeners, except the congeners whose log KOW 
exceeded 7. The slight deviation is probably owing to the structural hindrance and other 
unidentified factors. This model is able to accurately predicts the fugacity in fish, if accurate 
information about the chemical properties of pollutants are available .

POPs accumulation other than those in the temperate ones. PCBs in Er-Jen estuary were chosen as 
our target of study for their highest ambient and sedimentary PCB concentrations around Taiwan 
and wide range of physical and chemical properties. 
Former recovery operation of heavy metal from electric devices held in the river bank of the 
estuary led to serious contamination and ecological disasters of the region. Previous studies have 
found that the bioaccumulation of PCBs in the biota resided in the estuary was the highest over the 
entire island in . However, none of them implemented systematic analysis of the biogeochemical 
factors on the PCB bioaccumulation in this estuary. Thus one of the purposes of this study is 
trying to understand how the biogeochemical factors, including physiological behavior of biota, 
physicochemical characteristics of sediment and water affect the distribution of POPs in an 
estuarine ecosystem, and we also tried to develop a more precise routine measuring device than 
the traditional solvent extraction procedure to accurately estimate the activity or aqueous 
equivalent content (AEC) of target chemicals in concerned matrices to evaluate their chemical 
potential and direction of migration. This study finally aims to establish a simple model which is 
able to predicate the ultimate accumulation of POPs in higher levels of consumers through food 
web.

There are 209 possible chlorinated compounds of aforementioned structure and are referred 
to as congeners. In general, the water solubility and vapor pressure of PCB congeners decrease as 
the degree of substitution increases, and their lipid solubility as well as hydrophobicity increases 
with increasing chlorine substitution. PCBs in environment are mainly sorbed in the organic 
components of soils, sediments, and biological tissues, or associated with dissolved organic 
carbon in aquatic systems, rather than dissolved in water. The sorption of PCBs in environmental 
matrixes is believe to be an non-competitive and concentration-independent sorption process, or 
namely the partitioning (Chiou et al. 1998; Chiou et al. 1979; Chiou et al. 1981; Chiou et al. 1983; 
Chiou and Schmedding 1982; Karickhoff 1981; Karickhoff et al. 1979). PCBs are extremely 
hydrophobic, which results in their volatilization from water surfaces to atmosphere in spite of 
their relatively low vapor pressure. Therefore, atmospheric transport is a significant pathway for 
the redistribution of PCBs in the environment. Wania and Mackay suggested a grasshopper effect 
that described the longitudinal distribution of PCBs mainly to the various vaporization rate of 
specific congeners(Wania and Mackay 1996; Wania and Mackay 1993). Table 2-1 and 2-2 
summarize some basic physicochemical properties of PCB homologues and commercial mixtures. 
 
2.1.2.  Toxicity of PCBs toward Human.  
Cancer potency. The carcinogenic potential of PCBs is affected by the number and position of 
the chlorine atoms. Coplanar PCBs, resemble to dioxins and furans, may exert toxic effects like 
dioxins. Adverse effects are found associated with higher blood concentrations of them. Overall, 
the human toxicity studies have only provided limited to inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity. 
The animal studies, however, have shown sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity of them. Based

decreased in recent years owing to banning the uses of them since late 1980s. Fish consumption 
advisories issued by EPA in US are concentrated in closed lakes, coastline and estuaries, where 
large quantity of pollutants and nutrients where discharged and resulted in accumulation in biota. 
Therefore, fish caught in aforementioned areas deserve careful investigation.

2.1.3. Factors controlling the fate of PCBs in environment.  
Atmospheric transport. The fate of PCBs in environment is strongly dependent on individual 
congers’ physicochemical properties. PCBs are globally circulated and present in all 
environmental media.  
Atmospheric transport is the most important mechanism for global dispersion of PCBs. Low 
chlorinated biphenyls migrate gradually toward polar latitudes in a series of 
volatilization/deposition cycles, while medium-chlorinated biphenyls remain in mid-latitudes, and 
highly chlorinated biphenyls remain close to the source of contamination (Cousins and Jones 1998; 
Wania and Mackay 1993). Once in the atmosphere, PCBs are present in the vapor phase and 
sorbed to particles. PCBs in the vapor phase appear to be more mobile and are transported further 
than particle-bound PCBs. Those airborne PCBs are removed by wet and dry deposition from the 
atmosphere (Agrell et al. 2002). The chemical properties of PCBs (low water solubility, high 
stability, and semi-volatility) favor their long-range transport, therefore, PCBs have ever been 
detected in arctic air, water and organisms. Some with significant amount reviewed atmospheric 
contents of PCBs in urban and rural area reported in the literatures are shown in Table 2-7. 
 
Partitioning among phases. PCBs in aqueous phase are transported by molecular diffusion and 
water currents. Sinks of PCBs in a water column include sorption to suspended solids and 
sediments as well as volatilization from water surfaces to atmosphere. Higher chlorinated 
congeners are more likely to be sorbed, while lower chlorinated congeners are more likely to 
volatilize (Wania and Mackay 1996; Wania and Mackay 1993). PCBs are also removed from 
water column by concentrating in biota through gill exchange from water and dietary uptake from

2.2. Linkage between the sediment concentration and fish body burden and its 
seasonal variation 
Seasonal variations of patterns or concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have 
been observed in various environmental media, and they can be used to identify the sources or 
fate of these recalcitrant chemicals. Factors causing seasonal variation of PCB concentration 
include temperature difference, precipitation, congener-specific properties, physiological 
behaviors of biota, etc.  
Temperature-dependent variations of PCB concentration were observed in water (Bremle 
and Larsson 1997; Bruhn and McLachlan 2002), atmosphere (Haugen 1999; Kiss 2001; 
Manchester-Neesvig 1989), soil (Wickie and Amelung 2000) and atmospheric deposition (Carrera 
2002). Higher PCBs level commonly observed in warmer season than in colder season was 
attributed to higher water temperature, higher air/gas exchange rate and higher desorbing rate of 
PCBs from sediment to water. Meanwhile, PCB body burden in aquatic biota was found higher in 
spring than in autumn. This was mainly attributed to the consumption by the organisms in winter, 
which would result in a concentration effect (Harding et al. 1997; Huhnerfuss et al. 1995; 
Stapleton et al. 2002; Wiklund et al. 2003).  
Additionally, rain falls, either seasonal or episodic, are important factors on the distribution 
of PCBs. Precipitation not only scavenge the airborne PCBs down to ground water bodies, but 
also change the concentration and patterns of PCBs in the river water (Bremle and Larsson 1997). 
On the other hands, short-term episodic precipitation brought intense surface runoff to the 
16     Chap. 2  Background and Theories 
 
Er-Jen River, situated in the southwestern part of Taiwan, is the most polluted river on the 
island due to its long-term receiving of untreated sewage and industrial wastewater (EPA. 2005). 
In addition, a PCB concentration as high as 77 µg g-1 was found in the soil samples collected near 
the river in early 1990s (Huang et al. 1992). PCBs and dioxins were also found in the fish residing 
in the estuary (Ling et al. 1995) and nearby fish farms (Lu et al. 1995), a PCB body burden of 
3400±470 ng g-1 was detected in the estuarine mullets (Chen 1994). A contaminated sites were 
found near the river. Storm runoff has long been carrying PCB contaminated topsoil into the river 
and letting it settle at the bottom of the estuary. Storm waters also conveyed large amounts of 
upstream sediments downward, which might dilute or cover the pre-existing sediments. The mid-
summer storms that bring more than 90% of the yearly precipitation (R.O.C. Central Weather 
Bureau) might have great influences on the distribution of river sediment and probably to the 
sediment feeders. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the precipitation effects on the seasonal 
variation of PCBs in sediment and bottom dwellers in tropical regions, and further to establish the 
linkage between them.  
 
2.3. Habitat variation on the PCB body burden of fish 
Spatial variation of PCB concentration in biota has been observed in many studies, which 
were focused on pairs of distinctly different regions, such as contaminated versus remote as well 
as wild versus cultivated, where obvious deviations were expected. However, PCB concentration 
and pattern of fish in the nearby coastline and fish farms of this studied estuary, which are close to 
18     Chap. 2  Background and Theories 
 
areas may have the possibility to harm the health of the consumers who ingest the contaminated 
fishes. Furthermore, a number of coastal fish farms nestled to the harbor and the estuary were 
suspected contaminated through air-water exchange and atmospheric deposition due to former 
larger scale metal recovery operation (Ling et al. 1995; Lu et al. 1995). Fish in these farms, though, 
are supposedly not to contact with the formerly contaminated sediment directly, still have the 
potential to accumulate PCBs from water and deposited airborne particles. Until now, these farms 
are still providing the majority of fish supply for local fish markets.  
The predominant species in the concerned area, mullet fish (Liza macroples)(Kuo and Shao 
1999), are bottom dwellers, for which sediment detritus comprises 98 % of its dietary source 
(Horinouchi and Sano 2000). Therefore, the PCBs retained in the sediments are presumed to be 
the dominant source of the fish that resided in these two suspected contamination sites. On the 
other hands, the fish that inhabited the nearby coastal fish farms without direct contact with the 
contaminated sediments were supposedly to experience PCBs through the water rather than the 
sediment. Thus, PCB concentration of these concerned fish may exhibit different profile, and the 
PCB body burden may also vary significantly according to their life experiences  
In the past, most of the studies were focused on the fishes residing in this estuary. There was 
lacking in understanding on the extent of PCB accumulation and exposure route of fishes that 
inhabited the harbour and the fish farms. The bioaccumulation potential of PCBs toward the fish 
inhabiting these regions deserves further investigation and detail inspection. By investigating the 
PCB content and congener profiles of fish samples from the estuary, the harbour and the fish farm, 
this study will shed light on the exposure pathway of PCBs toward the organisms and human that

in which, TLi is the trophic level of the ith dietary source of predator, and Ci is the dietary 
composition of ith prey of studied predator. Accordingly, trophic levels are not all integral number 
and could be real ones. Table 2-9 shows the trophic levels and food sources of some species that 
were often caught in the studied estuary, in which few of the trophic levels are integral numbers. 
Trophic level is determined by means of the dietary composition in studied organisms. 
However, some components in the dietary composition might not be clearly identified and resulted 
in a biased trophic level. In the last decade, other than the dietary composition, biological 
interpretation of change in the relative abundance of naturally occurring stable isotope of carbon 
and nitrogen in organism, the component specific isotope analysis (CSIA), were applied to 
determine the trophic level. Stable isotope were found heavier in higher trophic level’s organisms 
and performed nearly linear correlation between trophic level and concentration of POPs (Broman 
et al. 1992). Applications of the ratio of stable isotope became well accepted approach to verify 
the trophic level of organism.(Hoekstra et al. 2003; Muir et al. 2003; Sormo et al. 2003).

correlation of PCB concentration with trophic level in these lakes demonstrated that there might 
be some hidden mechanisms, rather than the presumed straight forward food web magnification, 
to lead to the unpredictable situation. In another research held in Lake Michigan’s Calumet Harbor, 
the isotope analysis unexpectedly revealed that juvenile round gobies have a greater isotope 
signature and thus occupy a higher food web position than their predators, the smallmouth bass. 
The switch in food web positions is due in part to the often-ignored role of detritus, such as fish 
carcasses, zebra mussels’ feces, and the particles of undigested food wrapped in mucus that they 
excrete, which are known as pseudo feces. When sediment dwelling organisms such as insects and 
tiny crustaceans eat this detritus, they accumulate contaminant burdens linked to organisms at 
higher positions in the food web. As a result, they receive a larger dose of PCBs than the adult 
gobies that mainly consume zebra mussels, which are lower on the food web.(Pelley 2005) 
In the studied semi-opened estuarine region, which fish might migrate into or out of 
ecosystem, is not similar to the aforementioned nearly-closed ecosystems. Prey-predator 
relationships in the estuary are thought not a simply straight forward linear chain, but more a 
crosslink web. In addition, fishes that inhabit the estuary permanently and consume the 
contaminated sediment are presumed to possess higher PCB content than those fishes that 
appeared occasionally. The permanently inhabiting fishes are believed to be bottom dwellers and 
the migrating fishes are more likely to be pelagic dwellers. It will be of importance to investigate 
the difference of body concentration and congener pattern of PCBs, and to verify if there is any 
difference in the pattern of food chain bioaccumulation between the two groups of organisms and 
establish a model to predict the quantity and patterns of PCB body loading.  
26     Chap. 2  Background and Theories 
 
chemical activity, especially for those very hydrophobic chemicals, seemed to be the key for 
determining bioconcentration factor.  
Extraction is one of the method for measuring by using traditional solvent and complicated 
mimic recipe (Kelsey et al. 1997; Tang et al. 1999). While using the traditional extraction from 
raw matrix sample or infiltrated water sample, no matter what type of liquid or solid phase 
(Kukkonen et al. 2003; Morrison et al. 2000; Tang et al. 1999) extraction reagents were used or 
massive amount of water and manpower have spent (Wodarg et al. 2004), might still overestimate 
the free dissolved organics concentration because whose absorption in particle-bound, dissolved 
colloid or even humic substances (Ramos et al. 1998) were not completely depleted. Hence, 
evolutional passive sampling devices based on equilibrium partition theorem have demonstrated 
their potential in this field since last decade. Pawliszyn and coworkers (Arthur and Pawliszyn 
1990) developed a solid phase microextraction (SPME) method that applied a 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated fiber to sense organic content in its surrounding 
compartment. The principles and advantages of SPME have been described in detail in previously 
studies (Baltussen et al. 2002; Erickson 2003; Mayer et al. 2003). In general, fibers were hung in 
the headspace of measuring matrix and sensing the organics by sorbing them into the coated 
polymer, sorbed fiber then were inserted to a thermal desorber for GC analysis. The main 
advantage of the SPME is that only trace amount of chemicals will be sorbed into the coating and 
left the bulk concentration of the measuring phase unchanged, and this sorbing process will not 
influence the existing equilibrium. Therefore, unbiased bioavailability is acquired through this 
process. The sorbing process of chemicals into the PDMS now is widely accepted as a partition 
process and serves as a surrogate to measure organic content in water (Poerschmann et al. 2000), 
28     Chap. 2  Background and Theories 
 
equilibrium in different phases can be referenced to one standard phase for comparison. Lack of 
trustful partitioning coefficient of PDMS to air, therefore aqueous phase is assigned as the 
referenced phase in this study instead of gas phase. Fugacity is replaced by available chemical 
content in water and is defined as aqueous equivalent content (AEC) that can be calculated 
through the following equation. 
PWSPME K/CACE = ..................................................................................................... (2-8) 
in which PWK is the partitioning coefficient of PDMS to water. A similar equation describing the 
partitioning coefficient between sediment organic adjusted content and ACE is  
SPMEPWSedOM C/KCK = ............................................................................................... (2-9) 
In which KOM is the distribution constant of chemical in organic matter and water, and CSed is the 
organic adjusted chemical content. KPW can be determined by laboratory experiment or previous 
experiment correlation. The artifacts and interferences in determining KPW have been evaluated in 
previous studies (Mayer et al. 2000; Oomen et al. 2000). Considering of the glass absorption effect 
has been taken to establish a linear free energy relationship, 360log890log OWPW .K.K += , 
between KOW, the octanol water partition coefficient, and KPW, the solid phase partition coefficient, 
to reduce the error of overestimation of KPW for very hydrophobic chemicals (Kow > 6). 
Since in many local estuaries, the exposure routes and sources of bioaccumulation in biota 
have not been fully understood, therefore remedial actions of some contaminated estuaries are still

and aromatic chemicals. Also a linear line (log BCF = 0.048 log Kow ) from Mackay (Mackay 
1982) indicated that a unity slope of this line can be expected if chemical content is lipid 
adjusted and can be expressed as Lloglog OWL += KBCF , in which L is the lipid content of 
biota. In some studies, however, the linear relation is not followed in the high KOW range, 
which was suggestedly attributed to structure hindrance and biotransformation. Several studies 
suggested that a highest BCF were found when log Kow reach 7, and decreased with 
increasing log Kow (Hope et al. 1998; Meylan et al. 1999). Some relations found between the 
BCF and log KOW are shown in Fig. 2-3.

The magnifying ratio model is more practicable than complicated mechanistic model and 
less site-specific than fully empirical model while predicating the body burden of chemicals in 
biota. However, the predicating model might not be suitable for very hydrophobic chemicals for 
the magnifying ratio was determined through the facet, rather than exactly from the tissue of biota. 
Since several studies revealed that highly hydrophobic chemicals were less accumulative than 
expectation owing to their structural hindrance. Therefore, the fugacities of organic compounds in 
the facet are probably higher than in the body. In addition, the magnifying ratios are solely from 
literature, there might be more data needed to refine this model. 
 
2.6.3. Mechanistic model.  
The earliest mechanistic model was based on a one-compartment-rate-constant approach 
which was developed by Neely (Neely et al. 1974). A governing equation of similar concept 
that provided by Thomann and Connolly (Agrell et al. 2002; Thomann and Connolly 1984) is 
shown as following:

To verify our assumptions that fishes accumulated PCBs mainly through the dietary sources, 
especially from the sediment, and fishes at higher trophic levels will accumulate higher 
concentration of PCBs through food web than the lower ones. Samples of sediments and fishes 
were collected and the fingerprint of PCBs were used to evaluate the above assumptions. 
Sediments and bottom dwellers were collected in the estuary before and after wet season. In 
addition, biota samples from other habitats were collected to compare with the samples in the 
target region. Further more, samples from bottom fishes to pelagic dwellers, from presumed 
primary level producer (sediment) to secondary level and higher level of consumer were collected 
and analyzed to evaluate the food web accumulation. 
For the purpose of risk management of PCBs, this study also tried to establish empirical, 
semi-empirical and mechanistic models to predict the PCB body burden of fishes collected in 
estuary, and predictions were compared with the data that derived from actual samples. The 
framework of this study is illustrated in Fig. 3.1. 
3.1.  Samples collection 
Samples, including river water, surface sediment and biota, were collected in Er-Jen River 
before and after rainy season (May and September), respectively, from 2002 to 2004. Selected 
biota specie (Liza macrolepis) was also caught from fish farms and Ann-Ping harbour. Detailed 
information of the sample collection procedures is described in following sections. 
3.1.1. Sediment samples 
Eleven sampling sites for surface sediments were situated along the estuary and were named 
EJ1 to EJ11 in sequence from upstream to river mouth as shown in Fig.3-2. EJ1 was located most

should happen not only in the year 2002, but also in the succeeding years (2003 and 2004). 
Therefore, it was assumed that the variations due to precipitation might recur periodically and the 
distribution of PCBs in May 2003 was similar to May 2004. Thus, the original dataset before wet 
season in the second studied year (May 2003) was replaced by the dataset collected in May 2004. 
 
Sample Pretreatment. Sediments or soil samples were frozen dried for 100 hours and 
ground into fine powders using a stainless steel mortar and pestle. About 10 grams of sediments 
were transferred into a soxhlet apparatus and extracted with 300 mL of mixture of residue grade 
acetone and n-hexane (1:1, v/v) in a 70? water bath for 36 hours. The sediment extracts were 
then concentrated to 1mL in a rotary evaporator (Büchi) and cleaned by 5 mL concentrated 
sulfuric acid (Merck), then back extracted with hexane three times and concentrated to 1 mL by 
nitrogen gas stream. The 1 mL concentrate was then passed through a pipette (10mm ID) packed 
with sulfuric-acid (Merck) treated silica gel (70-230 mesh, for column chromatography, 
Macherey-Nagel), silver-nitrate (J.T. Baker) coated silica gel and florisil (Merck). This extract 
was finally eluted with 70 mL n-hexane and rotary-evaporated to 1 mL for GC analysis. 
 
All biota samples were weighted and measured for their physical characteristics, length, 
weight, gender and age, prior to extraction. Samples were sliced to fillet and were prepared with 
the same procedure as sediment samples. Lipid content was performed through a weighing process 
after rotary evaporation and prior to the purification with sulfuric acid.

183, 128, 185, 174, 177, 171, 180, 170, 201, 203, 195 and 194) were identified and summarized as 
ΣPCB. Another standard of twelve environmentally significant congeners, IUPAC Nos. 18, 28/31, 
52, 44, 101, 149, 118, 153, 138, 180, and 194, provided by Supelco with known concentration was 
introduced as a quantification standard for specific congeners and summarized as PCB12. 
Decachlorobiphenyl (Supelco) was spiked into the sample before the extraction as a surrogate of 
the target compounds. The internal standard of GC performance was 2,4,6-Trichlorobiphenyl 
(Supelco). Only the peaks within the proper range (2 %) of the retention time when compared to 
the standards were counted for the quantification of PCBs congeners.  
A standard reference material (NIST 1939a) was applied to verify the feasibility of the 
measuring method. The average recovery of the congeners in the SRM is 82 ± 6 % with the range 
of 73 % (CB118) to 90 % (CB138/163). Method detection levels (MDL) were in the range of 
0.032 (CB44) to 0.088 (CB18) ng/g with the recovery of 96 ± 23% from spiked PCB standards. 
The recovery of surrogate CB209 was 70 ± 16% of sediment samples and 73 ± 7% of fish samples. 
Deviation between the Aroclor mixing standard and specific congener standard was 11± 6%. All 
data were presented without correction to the recovery. 
Organic content and grain size. Organic content of sediment was determined by sulfuric-
dichromate digestion and back titration with standard ferrous ammonium sulfate solution. Lipid 
content of biota was determined through weighting prior sulfate purification. Total organic matter 
of river water was determined by pyrophosphate oxidation method and analyzed by O.I. 
Analytical Type 1010 TOC Analyzer. Grain size distribution analysis was performed through wet

chlorinated congeners such as PCB 163, PCB 185 and PCB 201 that deviated slightly significantly. 
Residue check indicated that no detectable contaminants were observed after reinsertion. 
3.3.2. Sampling conditions.  
All types of sampling were held in the same type of borosilicate glass bottle (Schott Duran®) 
to omit the deviation from glass adsorption. Each glass bottle was agitated with a baredmetal 
magnetic stirrer at the same mixing intensity to reduce the interference from sorption of PCBs to 
the stirrer (not valid in the exposure of fish sample). Details of determining the aqueous uptake 
kinetic constant and partitioning coefficient of PDMS to water and to glass were described 
elsewhere (unpublished) (Hsieh et al. 2004). In general, carefully designed experimental 
procedure including large volume glass bottles, non-Teflon coated stirrers, and absorption effect 
from glass were all considered into the study to reduce the artifacts from experiment procedure. 
 
Exposure of SPME fiber to water, sediment and fish. Water sample in this study was placed in 
the original 5 L sampling glass bottle, and 5 cm long fibers were hung in the bottle’s headspace 
for 4 days. In the kinetic study of sediment, fibers were hung in a 600 mL glass bottle, and total 
500 mL slurry composed of 300 g wet sediments and Millipore grade water were filled into the 
bottle for 24, 48, 91, 188 and 380 hours to estimate the uptake constant. In the analysis of 
sediment AEC, 5 cm long fiber was exposed to the mixture of 30 g of wet sediment and 60 mL 
Millipore water in a 250 mL bottle for 380 hours. However, unlike in the water and the sediment, 
4 cm long fibers were directly inserted into the body tissue for the exposure of fish. The extraction 
time of the fibers in the tissue lasted from seconds to month in the kinetics section and 10 days in 
the determining of AEC, respectively.

3.4. Development of gastrointestinal tract magnifying model 
As shown in the literatures (Gobas et al. 1993) and Fig. 2-4 that the magnifying ratios of 
fugacities of organic compounds between fecal matters and foods of specific fish were found to 
increase with elevated KOW. Therefore, the magnification ratios might be referenced to food chain 
relation between prey and predator and can be used to predicate the biomagnification of 
hydrophobic chemicals through trophic transfer. The predicated magnification ratio of a chemical 
compound in specific fish with trophic level TL, after the biomagnification through (TL-TLR) 
levels of transfer, can be calculated by following formula:

When sediment, water and food were integrated together to generalize a benthic-pelagic 
food chain, the fugacities of concerned organisms were shown in Fig. 3-4. In which fs and fw 
denote the fugacities of chemicals in sediment and water column, respectively, f1 represents that of 
a pure pelagic specie that mainly consumes food from water, while f2 is the fugacity of a benthic 
dweller whose dietary source is from sediment. Therefore, for a pelagic specie whose dietary 
source comprise water, pelagic fish and benthic fish, the fugacity f3 is composed of fw, f1 and f2, as 
shown in Fig. 3-4.

of flow rate. Meanwhile, river flow rate was positively correlated to the precipitation (r = 0.93). 
Therefore, precipitation was considered the main factor on the fluctuation of river water quality. 
The average TOC found in river water for May and September were 6.1±0.56 mg/l and 1.0±0.16 
mg/l, respectively. This significant reduction of TOC ( p?0.0001) in September revealed the 
dilution effect of runoff water on the water constituents within the studied period.  
Consequently, precipitation is simultaneously responsible for both the dilution of water 
concentrations of BOD and ammonium nitrogen through the storm runoff, and the thickening of 
water solid content by upstream erosion.

the whole estuary, which indicated that new materials had been deposited evenly after 
precipitations. In the dry seasons, from September to May of next year, tidal current would 
selectively remove fine particles in the sediment at the river mouth sites EJ9 to EJ11, which 
resulted in the declining of fine particle fraction along the river. 
Shift of organic matter content and grain size distribution along the river indicated that fine 
and organic-rich particulates had been transported from upstream sector and river catchment to 
the river mouth through surface runoff and strong river flow. Original surface sediments in the 
estuarine sector might have been mixed or masked by the particulates from external sources after 
precipitation. However, the original sediments in the estuarine sector and river mouth were 
exposed again in dry season owing to the tidal current. Thus, a periodical change in the organic 
content and grain size distribution occurred seasonally.

deposited evenly over the estuarine sector and resulted in dilution and masking effects on the 
original distribution pattern in sediments.  
Contrary to the varied dry-solid-based PCB contents, organic-adjusted PCB content of the 
sediments along the estuary all increased after summer precipitation (Fig. 4-3B), which indicated 
that sediment enriched in PCBs were flushed into the estuary through surface runoff. The 
consequence of the re-deposition of high PCB content particles resulted in the average PCB12 of 
river mouth to increase slightly in 2002 and significantly in 2003. An increase in sedimentary 
PCB content was observed at the river mouth in September 2003, to a level higher than the 
suspected hot spots, suggests that external contamination source other than upstream erosion 
dominated the distribution of the river mouth’s surface sediment. Higher OM-normalized 
concentration denotes higher PCB activity and less aging material exported from PCB 
contaminated source during storm runoffs.  
Similar to the periodic changes of grain size distribution, these new-deposited particles in 
the sediment were mostly fine particles that might be gradually lost to the sea by tidal current in 
the dry seasons. Therefore, PCB content found in the dry season following a wet one was similar 
to that of the previous dry seasons.

interpret the PCB distribution along this estuary. The fraction of light PCBs, including tri- and 
tetra- chlorinated biphenyls such as CB18, CB28&31, CB 52 and CB44, found at eleven sites for 
the months of May and September are shown in Fig. 4-4. The fraction of light PCB of the 
sediments collected in May within estuarine sector (EJ2 to EJ8) were in the range of 30% to 40% 
and remained unchanged or varied insignificantly after the wet season (p = 0.8 of year 2002 and p 
= 0.54 of year 2003-2004). Contrarily, those collected from surface sediment of the river mouth 
zone (EJ9, EJ10 and EJ11) increased significantly from 30% to 50% (p < 0.005 of year 2002 and 
p < 0.001of year 2003-2004). Based on the observation of the varying light PCB fractions, these 
sampling sites can be roughly grouped into three main clusters, the upstream background EJ1, the 
estuarine sector EJ2 to EJ8, and the river mouth zone EJ9, EJ10 and EJ11. Based on their relative 
deviations of PCBs in 2002, a two-dimensional PCA plot of these sampling sites is displayed on 
Fig. 4-5. The plot also displayed three discrete clusters, which was coincident with the findings of 
grouped behavior of light fractions shown in Fig. 4-4. 
The seasonal variation of light PCB fraction in the river mouth sediments revealed that 
external sources had been introduced into this region. The most probable sources of invading 
mass were non-point sources flushed into the estuary during precipitation, including particles 
from atmospheric wet deposition, upstream erosion and surface runoff of river catchment. In 
addition, the relatively high PCB content of the invading particles observed in the river mouth, as 
compared with upstream sectors, suggests that there was another major contributor of external 
contamination other than the re-suspended upstream sediments. Original surface sediments in the 
river mouth zone with coarser size, lower organic and lower PCB content were more susceptible 
to external sources brought in by fine and organic-rich invading particles than those in the other 
estuarine sectors. Thus, a distinct PCB fingerprint indicating the terrestrial contribution of   PCBs

Previous studies (Ashley and Baker 1999; Cousins and Jones 1998; Meijer et al. 2002; 
Wania and Mackay 1993) suggested that a heavy-PCB-dominated pattern is an indicator of near 
source emission of PCBs, while a light-PCB-dominated pattern reflects a unweathered pattern or 
one that is from air-water exchange. In other words, light PCBs were believed to possess higher 
potential than heavy ones to partition or evaporate into water column and atmosphere. Thus, long-
lasting PCB residuals retained near a contamination source exhibited a more heavily chlorinated 
fraction than remote ones did. Such effects are regarded as aging or weathering.  
In this study, although sediments in the river mouth exhibited elevated light PCB fraction 
after each wet season in the succeeding years, significant increment of PCB content in this region 
suggested that its sources were not from remote weathered background contamination, but rather 
from a fresh local contamination source. Ling and coworkers (Ling et al. 1995) reported that the 
major type of contamination in this estuary resembles light and medium chlorinated rich mixture 
Aroclor® 1242 and 1254. Meanwhile, PCB residues in the estuarine sector and nearby villages 
seemed not weathered enough to show an enhancement of heavy fraction within only one decade. 
Therefore, newly deposited river mouth sediments still exhibited an unweathered PCB pattern that 
resembled the original Aroclor’s composition with prominent light PCB fraction. A similar 
pattern was observed by Ashley (Ashley et al. 2000) in the Hudson River where light homologs 
dominated the near source emission. 
Light PCB fraction is believed to be higher in the topsoils surrounding the estuary than in the 
river sediment due to the lower aging rate of PCBs in the topsoils. PCB residuals in the river 
sediments, especially the light ones, are presumed to partition easily into the aqueous phase by 
their intrinsically higher water solubility and by the external mixing effects from water current and

The average size, weight and lipid content of mullet fish caught in May and September of 
year 2002 and 2003 are shown in Fig. 4-6. The average PCB burden of mullet varied 
insignificantly (p = 0.79) from May’s 9012 to September’s 8143ng g-1 (lipid adjusted). 
Interestingly it did not follow simultaneously with the increasing trend in presumed dietary source, 
the surface sediment (Horinouchi and Sano 2000), in which it increased significantly (p < 0.05)

simultaneous increase of the sediment and the fish revealed that PCB patterns of the fish body 
rapidly reflected those found in the sediments.

In actuality, the concept of the exposure route of hydrophobic chemicals to fish has been 
widely discussed in numerous studies and remains doubtful to many. The greater fraction of light 
PCB of mullets caught in September was owing to the elevated light PCB fraction in the surface 
sediment. Unfortunately, lack of information on the aqueous PCB content in this estuary weakens

estuarine ecosystem and concentrated in the bottom dwellers, mullets.

level than the farmed ones had. The higher level was resulted from the residual PCBs sorbed in the 
suspended solids and sediments of the estuary and harbour, which were originated from former

The ever-published greatest PCB concentration of fish in Taiwan (3400±470 ng/g dw) was 
observed in Er-Jen estuary in 1994 in mullet fish, and followed by ladyfish and tilapia at the same 
location in the same year (Table 4-2). The PCB content of Er-Jen’s tilapia was 130 ng/g ww or 
was approximately equivalent to 500 ng/g dw (Wang et al., 2000), which was already 60% of the 
1994’ peak value (825±451ng/g dw). There seems a descending trend of PCB content in fish in 
Er-Jen River in the last decade after banning the use of PCBs for near a decade. Similarly, in our 
study, the average PCB content of the mullet fish was 1918 ng/dw, which was only 56 % of the 
1994’s observed peak. Both studies reveal that approximate one half of the environmental source 
has been eliminated after one decade’s attenuation. However, there is still PCB content as high as 
either 4.2×103 ng/g ww or 1.9×104 ng/g dw of the fish collected, which was four times higher than 
the national dietary standard. This value is higher than the previous results observed from the river 
Seine (Blanchard et al. 1997; Chevreuil et al. 1995), San Francisco bay (Fairey et al. 1997), 
German bight (Huhnerfuss et al. 1995), but is far below the Housatonic River in which 
concentrations of PCBs were up to 556 mg/kg ww in bass (Reiser et al. 2004). 
The ΣPCB of the fish samples from the Ann-Ping harbour in autumn and spring were 
2.6×102 and 69 ng/g ww, respectively. In the past, no observation has ever been reported on the 
contamination level and exposure sources. Although the ship dismantling industry has been faded 
out for more than a decade, it is believed that the residues are still retained in this region and 
accumulated in the body of biota inhabiting there. 
The ΣPCB was 22 ± 3 ng/g ww or 171 ± 23 ng/g lpd in the fish from the fish farms, which 
was far less than those of the samples from the other two hot spots, and was in the same 
magnitude of the samples from other slightly contaminated local rivers as shown in Table 4-2.  
84     Chap. 4 Results and Discussions 
 
 
However, comparing with the farmed fish reported locally and abroad (Table 4-2) including 
the tilapia samples (0.18 ng/g wet wt.) in Taiwan (Lung et al. 2003), the pooled fresh water fish 
samples (7.8 ng/g wet wt.) collected from different supermarkets in the U.S.(Schecter et al. 1997), 
the PCB level is slightly higher and is in the range as the farmed bass in Portugal, 155 to 294 ng/g 
lpd (Antunes and Gil 2004). In general, fish lived in the farms that nestled within the two hot spots 
did not show particularly high PCB content than other studies. However, the average PCB content 
of the studied fish in the concerned fish farms is still higher than those of the fish samples from 
other local fish markets. Though the content is far lower the dietary standard, the tendency of PCB 
accumulation in these fish farms deserves prolonged monitoring. 
 
4.2.3. Congener profile  
Total forty peaks, from trichlorobiphenyls to octachlorbiphenyls, were identified as shown 
in Figure 4-9. In respect of the main congeners of these profiles, samples from the harbour and the 
estuary were different from that of the farmed ones. The most abundant congeners from the former 
two locations were CB138, CB180, CB 153, and CB118, in which hexachlorobiphenyls and 
pentachlorobiphenyls comprised major portion of the total PCBs; while those of the fish farm 
were CB52, CB118 and CB138, and tetrachlorobiphenyls and hexachlorobiphenyls were the most 
abundant congeners of the farmed samples.

As shown in Figure 4-10, CB 138 and CB180 were the dominant congeners in the estuary 
and harbour’s fish. However, the dominant congener was CB52 in fish of the fish farm, which is 
similar to what was found in the fish samples such as milkfish, white pomfret and hailtail that 
purchased from local fish markets of Taiwan (Lung et al. 2003), in which CB52 was the highest 
congener, followed by CB138 and CB153.  
88     Chap. 4 Results and Discussions 
 
far away hot spots exhibited light-chlorinated PCBs in this study. The PCB content of the 
estuarine surface sediments was in the range of 706 to 7463 ng/g organic matter (Fu and Wu 
2006). The congener distribution pattern of studied samples in different habitats should vary with 
their origins. Therefore, if surface sediments were assumed as the dietary source of benthic feeder 
such as our target fish, mullet, then fish samples from the contaminated estuary and the harbour 
should have carried higher chlorinated PCBs in their body, and fish raised in the farms should 
have exhibited more light chlorinated PCBs than the other habitats.

4.3. Food chain accumulation of fishes in Er-Jen Estuary 
 
4.3.1. Determination of trophic level 
The length, width and weight of collected fish samples are listed on Table 4-3. The trophic 
levels of these fishes were determined by analyses from stable isotope ratio or dietary composition 
of reviewed data from the Fish Base (http://www.fishbase.org).  
The analyses of stable isotope ratio, δ13C and δ15N of the fishes the δ13C ranges from -
22.10‰ (sediment) to -14.15‰ (S. putnamiae), meanwhile, the δ15N ranges from 2.59‰ 
(sediment) to 15.39‰ ( S. putnamiae). The δ13C of sediments in seabed and lake was found to be 
near -22‰ to -25‰ in previous studies (Macintosh et al. 2004; Stapleton et al. 2001), which was 
slightly lower than our finding in this estuary.  
δ15N is a useful indicator of trophic level and is employed in bioaccumulation studies (Hop 
et al. 2002; Macintosh et al. 2004; Stapleton et al. 2001). The gap of δ15N between the prey and 
the predator were found to be 3‰ to 4‰ for aquatic biota, and 3.8‰ is often applied to calculated 
the trophic gap between biota. Trophic levels of the sampled fishes were calculated by defining C. 
chanos to be at second trophic level. Phytoplankton is supposed to be dominant dietary source of 
C. chanos. Therefore, trophic positions of the rest of the species were calculated by Eq. 2-5 
following the studies of Fisk et al, etc. (Fisk et al. 2001; Hop et al. 2002) and shown in details in 
Table 4.4. 
92     Chap. 4 Results and Discussions 
 
It is not easy to clarify which trophic level is appropriate because both approaches have its 
drawbacks. The reviewed database suggested that the sediment is the primary producer will 
unavoidably underestimate the PCBs burden of biota in our case; since some fish, especially the M. 
cephalus, do not follow the suggesting feeding behavior and show much higher trophic level by 
isotope method. 
In general, the trophic levels calculated from isotope analyses are higher than those from 
database, and those of some species are much higher than what we expected. But the trophic level 
of sampled species for both methods are still in the same range, and acceptable direct correlation 
between them suggest that both of them are of practical usage to predicate the trophic transfer of 
PCBs. Therefore, following prediction of PCB body burden in fishes, based on trophic position, 
are simulated with the results from the isotope analyses and database, respectively. 
The correlation of abundance of fishes with trophic level (T.L.) (based on database) is a 
near-peak-shape curve. Fishes of the T.L in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 are dominant species in this 
estuarine region. Dominant species, including L. macrolepis, A. maculates and N. come, were 
bottom dwellers that mainly feeding on detritus including plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton and 
other benthos. Detail information of their food sources is listed on Table 2-9. The fishes with 
higher trophic levels than aforementioned bottom dwellers are more likely pelagic dwellers and 
are rarely caught. It might be attribute to the characteristic of pelagic dwellers’ habitat, where 
water is deeper and water quality is better than those in the estuary. On the other hand, the 
dominant bottom dwellers are more resistant to organic pollution than the pelagic dwellers and 
feed on settled material easily from the estuary. Therefore, the fishes with T.L. higher than the

catfish were not dominant species in the estuary and were only caught occasionally. Also the 
retention time of the pelagic dwellers in the estuary are likely shorter than the bottom dwellers. 
 
4.3.2. The relationship of PCB concentration in fishes to their trophic level 
The concentration of PCBs in the fishes and the surface sediment collected on September 
2004 are listed on Table 4-3 and Table 4-4, respectively. The standard deviation of PCB 
concentrations did not express the range of the data properly due to big standard deviations of 
these measured values. The deviation was attributed to some outliers which were different from 
the average value significantly. To alleviate the difficulty, the distribution of the range of data was 
96     Chap. 4 Results and Discussions 
 
Trophic level obtained from different approaches revealed slightly different results. In 
which, trophic levels from database reveal a smooth linear correlation that the PCB content in the 
sediment-linked food chain ranked in sequence from the lowest sediment (T.L. = 1.0), to C. 
chanos (2.0), M. cephalus (2.1), N. come (2.76), L. macrolepis (2.74), and A. maculatus (3.3). The 
high linear correlation of PCBs with trophic level of the bottom dwellers suggests the existence of 
biomagnification process. Meanwhile, trophic level from isotope analyses reveal a worse linear 
correlation owing to that M. cephalus is positioned at level 3.13 but accumulated much less PCBs 
than L. macrolepis  positioned at 2.90.  
The accumulation of PCBs in the sediment related biota was attributed to the uptake of 
PCBs residues retained in the river sediments and surrounding topsoils. PCBs consumption by 
bottom dwellers led to the accumulation of PCBS in their body, and transferred to higher level of 
biota through food web. The sediment still pose potential threat to the sediment-dwelling biota.  
However, the worse linear relation between PCBs and TL in the higher trophic level of 
pelagic dwellers indicates that no obvious transfer through trophic level was found among them. 
The reason for the lower PCB concentration and worse linearity in the pelagic dwellers than the 
bottom dwellers are probably attributed to the lower retention time than the bottom dwellers in the 
estuarine habitat. It has been demonstrated in the previous sections that fish of same species 
inhabit nearby but different areas will accumulate significantly different amount of PCBs. Fish 
reside in heavily PCB contaminated areas is believed to accumulate higher PCBs than those 
inhabit clean areas. Due to the physiological behavior, the pelagic dwellers migrate in and out the 
estuary for dietary purposes, thus the retention time of the pelagic dwellers caught in the estuarine 
region might not be long enough to accumulate to the extent as those bottom dwellers did.

4.3.3. Congener profiles within fishes 
The congener’s profiles of the sediment and the bottom dwellers were shown in Fig. 4-18. 
The dominant congeners in sediment and fishes varied significantly. The main congeners in the 
sediment were lightly chlorinated congeners such as PCB 52, 49 and medium-chlorinated PCB 
149, but that in the fishes shifted from lightly chlorinated PCB 28, 52 and 49 of the lower trophic 
level of fish, to medium and heavily chlorinated PCB 110, 153, 138 and 180 of the higher trophic 
level of fishes. The chlorination content in fishes increased with direct proportion to their trophic 
levels. As shown in Fig. 4-19 and 4-20, the medium and heavy PCB homologue fraction in fishes 
increased with elevated trophic level, while the light ones decreased with elevated level. Fig. 4-21 
and 4-22 reveal the inverse linear regression line of some selected light congeners and the direct 
linear regression of the medium and heavy ones. The direct proportion of fraction of heavy 
congeners to trophic level implies that the high chlorinated congeners tend to be more easily 
magnify in biota than the light-chlorinated ones do. 
The increase portion of penta- to octachlorinated congeners in the fishes with elevated 
trophic level were also found in other studies (Blankenship et al. 2005; Kay et al. 2005). The 
observations are were mainly attributed to the partitioning tendency of chemicals. Higher KOW 
value of congener mean higher potential of partitioning capacity in lipid, thus PCBs with higher 
KOWs (log KOW > 6) are concentrated in fish lipid through food chain. On the other hand, light 
PCBs with lower KOW value were more likely to be degraded in biota by biotransformation and are 
not enriched in higher trophic level of biota through food chain transfer.

4.3.4. Biota to sediment accumulation factor 
Sediment is known to be the main contamination source to aquatic biota in some aquatic 
ecosystems, therefore, sediment is often recognized as the origin of bioaccumulation (Kay et al. 
2005). One of the common indicators describing the degree of biomagnification from sediment to 
biota is the biota to sediment accumulation factor (BSAF), which is calculated as the ratio of the 
chemical concentration in fish lipid to that in organic matter in sediment. Applying the BSAF, the 
tendencies of accumulation of chemicals in diverse species can be compared with each other. 
Similar to the findings in the total PCB content of fishes, A. maculatus were found to have 
the highest BSAF in the studied bottom dwellers, follow by L. macrolepis, N. come, M, cephalus 
and C. chanos (Fig. 4-23). Trophic level is believed to be the main governing factor for the 
magnitude of BSAF and increased with elevated trophic level. In the sediment-link food web, 
medium chlorinated PCBs might be magnified as great as thirty times larger than in the sediment. 
While the magnifying effect were not so significant for lightly and heavily chlorinated PCBs, and 
were approximately within tenth fold. 
Fig. 4-24 revealed the relation of BSAF of the individual bottom dwellers to KOW, which all 
performed a similar near bell shape distribution and only deviated in the height of the bell. The 
higher height of bell means greater degree of biomagnification in the biota. The BSAF value in the 
log KOW range of 6.0 to 7.0 were found significantly greater than the others (p < 0.01), followed 
by those in the range of 7.0 to 8.0, and those less than 6.0. 
110     Chap. 4 Results and Discussions 
 
2,4,5-substitution (CB-99, 138, 153, 180), which are typically recalcitrant in most biota, had the 
highest accumulation potential compared to all other congeners. The relatively high 
biomagnification of these congeners is also found in other marine food chain studies (Fisk et al. 
2001; Hoekstra et al. 2003; Hop et al. 2002).  
The decreasing accumulation of the very hydrophobic chemicals is probably due to the 
structural hindrance that lowered the partitioning rate of heavy PCBs into the cells of biota. When 
considering the systematic dynamic, if the partitioning rate of heavy PCBs is slower than the 
digestion rate, the heavy ones might not fully partition into biota before they were excreted. Thus 
the accumulations of them were not as high as those congeners that had higher partitioning rate. 
Therefore, the structural hindrance, rather than the hydrophobicity, is more likely the governing 
factor for the accumulation of chemicals when their log KOW are larger than 7.0. However, until 
now, no direct evidence or experiment was conducted to prove the hypothesis of structural 
hindrance. Further studies are needed. 
Besides the structural hindrance, another possible reason was the lower biotransformation 
efficiency of very hydrophobic congeners (log KOW > 7). The biotransformation rate of the very 
hydrophobic chemicals from dietary sources into fish body was supposed to be lower than their 
excretion rate. Therefore they were eluted out of fish body before were digested into, and led to a 
lower BSAF as comparing to other chemicals with lower log KOW values. However, the 
biotransformation efficiency is not fully dependent on KOW and is a compound-specific related 
process. The KOW of some phthalate ester is as high as 9.0, but they were not biomagnified with 
increasing trophic level. Rather, they declined for increasing trophic levels and resulted in trophic 
dilution, which was attributed to their higher biotransformation rate (Macintosh et al. 2004).

The required equilibration time to attain 90% equilibration ( %C/C 90)P(tP ≥∞→ ) ranged from 
few hours for low chlorinated congeners to more than hundred hours for heavily chlorinated 
congeners. The uptake constant α, obtained by adjusting its value in Eq.4-5 to fit in observed data, 
is higher for less chlorinated PCBs than medium and heavily ones. Though there are errors up to 
20% for light PCBs when dealing with the solid phase extraction approach, Eq. 4-5 is still the 
most commonly used formula to predict the time-varying concentration. This deviation of 
observed in the light PCBs was attributed to analytical error for light PCBs with the method of 
GC-ECD. Nevertheless, correlation coefficient between most of these predicated curves and 
datasets, with few exceptions such as PCB 18, are higher than 0.95. It reveals that modeling the 
rate of sorption with the first-order mass transfer equation is appropriate.

Fish. In traditional exposures of fish to PDMS fiber, fibers were hung in the headspace of water 
and sediment to sense the chemicals retained in the matrix below. However above exposure 
approach failed to measure the chemicals in fish in this study because the signals of sorbed 
chemicals in the fibers after one-month exposure were too weak to quantify. Therefore, exposure 
of fibers to fish conducted in this study were referenced to the matrix-SPME method, which fibers 
were directly buried in the sediment (Mayer et al. 2000) or soil (Conder et al. 2003). i.e. the fibers 
were directly inserted into fish tissue. Unlike the sediment’s kinetic curves are represented with 
the ratio of Ct/Ctu, the kinetic curves of fish was plotted with original instrumental response (peak 
area) and was shown in Fig. 4-28. A surprisingly quick equilibrium was observed between the

4.4.2. Partition coefficient of organic matter to water 
The traditional estimation of fugacity or chemical potential in concerned phase is calculated 
by dividing the total extracted content of target organic with its fugacity capacity (MacKay 2001). 
The often-mentioned question of the accuracy of fugacity capacity, or more exactly the KOC, is not 
well established. This study is trying to measure the AEC and total extracted content to estimate 
the KOC from Eq. (2-6) to Eq. (2-9).

exhibits a slightly steeper slope than others and is not as perfectly as Karickhoff et al. has 
predicated (Karickhoff et al. 1979), the overestimation of chemical content from the disturbance 
of colloid and dissolved organic in water, often observed in high Kow range, is effectively 
depleted by the application of SPME in a higher KOC of very hydrophobic compound. 
 
Fig. 4- 29. Double log plot of log KOC and log KOW. A near unity but slightly steeper slope in 
current study reveals that overestimation of aqueous solubility in former study led to a lower KOC 
Several factors might explain the less steeper slope, including insufficient extraction time, 
exposure concentration and overestimation of aqueous content (Oliver and Niimi 1983). This 
study has been carefully designed to minimize aforementioned influences. First, fibers were 
exposed in sufficient time to reach equilibrium. Secondly, chemicals’ contents in sediment and 
sediment samples are in broad range to reduce small range deviation. Finally, SPME method

food chain would retard the food chain accumulation and the so called bioaccumulation was lack 
of scientific proof.  
To clarify the argument, a thermodynamic activity or fugacity, rather than the concentration 
gradient, was introduced to interpret the moving tendency of chemicals from a high concentrated 
phase to a diluted one. In that system, chemicals with higher activity will move to other matrix 
that possessed less activity potential. Therefore, hydrophobic chemicals will move from high 
activity phase such as dilute aqueous solution, to a less activated concentrated biota tissue and 
resulted in bioaccumulation. However, higher fugacity or activities of hydrophobic chemicals in 
aquatic biota than those of their prey imply that chemicals should move from biota to their 
surroundings. The activity increased with elevated trophic level seemed controversial to the 
thermodynamic principle.  
There were similar results reported in previous study showing the biomagnification in food 
web and food chains, but few of them mentioned the activity or fugacity of their studied target. 
The most convincing mechanism describing the negative transport through activity gradient was 
the gastrointestinal magnification (Gobas et al. 1993). Gobas et al. demonstrated that, in the 
gastrointestinal tract of fish, the fugacity of very hydrophobic, non-metabolizable chemicals (log 
KOW > 6) is elevated above the fugacity of the consumed food as a result of food digestion and 
absorption. Observed fugacities in fecal matter were up to 4.5-fold greater than the fugacity in 
their administered food. In the food chain accumulation process, highly hydrophobic chemicals 
accompanied with other digestible tissue of prey were ingested into the gastrointestinal tract of 
predator. However, due to the resistant to biodegradation, digestion efficiency of the hydrophobic 
chemical is significantly lower than that of the other tissues. Therefore, the fugacity capacities of

sediment in the Great Lake (Gobas and Maclean 2003) is contradictory to this result, which 
exhibited a negative correlation of fugacity ratio of buried sediment to water with log Kow. This 
might be attributed to the totally different site-specific characteristics. First, river depth of this 
estuary is relatively shallow (less than 3 m) comparing with the Great Lakes. Secondly, proposed 
magnification of pollutants in the sediment due to carbon mineralization that observed in the Great 
Lakes was not available in the research area owing to tidal mixing and continuous discharge of 
organics discharged into this estuary.

This formula can not be applied for pelagic dwellers and fish species with trophic level higher 
than A. maculatus.  
The prediction of PCB concentration in fishes by using the linear regression between the 
trophic level and the body burden is shown in Fig. 4-34. PCBs were estimated to be as high as 
5000 ng g-1 lipid for A. maculates at a trophic level of 4.34 (3.3). The observed values of PCBs in 
fishes with different trophic level were all found within the 95% confidence interval, which 
reveals that the empirical linear regression is a useful tool to predicate the total body burden of 
sediment-link bottom dwellers in the studied region. However, lacking theoretic background and 
detail information of individual congeners, empirical formula can not be generalized for risk 
analysis and further prediction on other ecosystem. 
4.5.2. Prediction of the concentrations of PCB congeners in fishes by magnifying ratio 
The magnifying ratio of fugacity (or AEC) was suggested based on the observation by 
Gobas et al. (1993) which showed that the transfer of chemical through each trophic level was 
accompanied with a magnifying of fugacity occurred in gastrointestinal tract. The ratio increase 
from less hydrophobic compound’s 0.014 to very hydrophobic compound’s 4.6. Therefore, the 
magnifying ratio of a PCB congener concentration in one specific fish species with trophic level 
TL can be calculated by Eq. 2-10: 
      )TL-(TLGS RMFMF =  
132     Chap. 4 Results and Discussions 
 
The calculated MFS, their polynomial simulated lines, its 95% confident interval, and the 
observed data from our studies were shown in Fig. 4-35 to 4-40.  
As shown in these figures, the sediment-link fishes collected in the estuary did accumulate 
PCBs from the river surface sediment, and the magnifying ratios of fishes to the sediment of our 
observed data were found close to the polynomial simulated line, but not fully within the 
simulated 95% confident interval. The observed PCB burdens of species are closer to the of 
predicted ones when the trophic levels are obtained from database than from the analyses of 
isotopes. It means that TL from database are more appropriate than isotope analyses in this study. 
Higher values of TL from isotope analyses resulted in higher calculated body burden than those 
from the database, and make their prediction away from the observed ones.  
As illustrated in aforementioned section, it is not easy to clarify which trophic level is 
appropriate for the prediction of PCBs in GIT magnifying model because both have its drawbacks. 
The reviewed database assumed the sediment to be the primary producer will unavoidably 
underestimate the PCBs burden of biota; while some trophic level of biota from isotope analyses, 
especially the M. cephalus, are not reasonable according to our knowledge of their feeding 
behavior, which resulted in an over-prediction above our observation. Even though, the GIT 
magnifying model is capable of predicting the biomagnification of organic transferring through 
trophic levels. When the PCB concentration of sediment (or primary producer) and the trophic 
levels of the interested species is available, the magnifying ratio is a conservative approach to 
predict the possible accumulation potential of fishes.  
However, some observed data fall out of the predicted range implies that there may be some 
other affecting factors other than the magnifying ratio. The observed data of fishes were lower

4.5.3. Prediction of concentration of PCB congeners in fishes by simplified fugacity model

The parameters and formula used in this formula to predicated the fugacity of fish were 
listed on Table 4-7 (Gobas 1993; Gobas et al. 1993). 
The predicted and observed fugacity and their ratio of the selected primary level sediment 
dweller, C. Chanos, were shown in Fig, 4-36 and 4-37, respectively. The fugacities of the fish 
ranges from 5×10-7 Pa to 10-5 Pa and is dependent on the characteristic of the congeners. Through 
the slope of the linear relationship between the predicted and the observed data were not 
identically unity, the observed data are averagely 1.33 times higher than the predicted ones. Their 
deviations are only within an order of magnitude implies that the prediction is acceptable and the 
simplified fugacity model is feasible to predict the body burden of the primary level bottom 
dwellers. 
One of the weakness in the prediction of PCBs body burden by means of this simplified 
fugacity model is the settling of the sediment at the primary producer level. In fact, sediment are 
composed of debris including algae, phytoplankton, zooplankton and even residue of higher level 
of biota. This might lead to the underestimation of trophic level of the river sediment and, 
136     Chap. 4 Results and Discussions 
 
The three approaches used to predict the body burden of fishes have their own advantages 
and disadvantages. The empirical formula is the easiest and accurate predicting tool, however, the 
generalization to other systems is not feasible. The magnifying ratio can be a method to roughly 
estimate the concentration of specific congener in fishes through the data of sediment. The 
fugacity model can precisely predict the concentration of individual congeners n fish, however, 
abundant data are needed to estimated the values of parameters.

to originate from air-water exchange with less chlorinated PCBs predominating. The deviation of 
concentration and congener profile in the three habitats indicates that these variations are 
attributed to their habitats, and sediment was the most possible source of PCBse to fish. 
The fishes in this estuary included the bottom dwellers such as C. chanos, M cephalus, L. 
macrolepis, N. come and A. maculates, and some pelagic dwellers such as M. cyprinoides, E. 
machnata, T. lepturus, S. putnamiae and M. cordyla.M. The bioaccumulation through food web in 
the bottom dwellers increased with their trophic level, while for the pelagic dwellers the 
phenomenon was unseen. The biomagnification found only in these sediment-linked fishes 
suggests that the surface sediments are the main source of PCBs in the estuary. That the pelagic 
dwellers remained unpolluted or less polluted than the bottom dwellers is probably owing to that 
the pelagic dwellers has shorter resident time in the polluted regions and that the dietary uptaken 
outside the region was relatively cleaner.  
The fraction of individual congener to total content  in fish was in directly proportional to 
their chlorination degree and increased with elevated trophic level, which indicates that the more 
hydrophobicity of the chemicals, the higher accumulation potential they will possess. The 
chemical with the highest accumulation potential was those with log KOW in the range 6.5 to 7.0. 
The trend decreases when log KOW exceeds 7. Biomagnification of the highly hydrophobic 
congeners are not increasing with their KOW. Structural hindrance and other unidentified factors 
may retard the partition of chemicals into the cells of biota. 
In the application of SPME, a 16.5 um polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated glass fiber was 
applied to detect the aqueous equivalent content (AEC) of polychlorinated biphenyls in field 
collected samples. Partition coefficient of organic matter to water, bioconcentration factor of water 
148    Chap. 5 Conclusion and Future Prospect      
 
probably highest fugacity in fishes from the fugacity of sediment and provided a conservative 
prediction for the use of the management of risk. But the prediction for those very hydrophobic 
congeners was not satisfactory and was deviated significantly from the observed data, which will 
cause overestimation of the accumulation tendency of these congeners.  
The simplified fugacity model is able to estimate the fugacity of individual congeners 
through the mass balance principles and reaction rate equations. Dominant mechanism involved in 
the uptake and excretion of PCBs in fish were employed, including uptake from gill respiration 
and dietary source, dilution through growth, excretion and biotransformation. The net balance of 
these reaction resulted in the accumulation in fishes. The predicted fugacity is slightly less than 
the observed ones for majority of the studied congeners, except the congeners whose log KOW 
exceeded 7. The slight deviation is probably owing to the structural hindrance and other 
unidentified factors. This model is able to accurately predicts the fugacity in fish, if accurate 
information about the chemical properties of pollutants are available . 
 
5.2. Future prospect 
This study has established the linkage between the sediment and the bottom dwellers and 
confirmed that the contamination source was from the buried bottom sediment, and verified the 
existence of the food web biomagnification of these sediment-linked feeders by observed data and 
model simulation. The results of this study indicated some unclarified questions and unsolved 
problems which need further attentions.  
150    Chap. 5 Conclusion and Future Prospect      
 
the interference from surrounding matrix without disrupting the equilibration between the sorption 
phase and the sensed matrix. 
In general, this study contributes a great deal to clarify the biomagnified relation of 
previously buried sediment and relevant bottom dwellers. This study also helps to elucidate the 
difference of accumulation potential in bottom dwellers and pelagic dwellers in the studied estuary. 
Finally we provide several approaches to predicate the PCB concentrations in fishes, which is also 
of great help to management of ecological and human health risk. Even though, much effort are 
still needed to pay on the identification of trophic level, lipid composition and resident time of 
fishes, and a easier detection method for routine analysis is worth further attentions.
