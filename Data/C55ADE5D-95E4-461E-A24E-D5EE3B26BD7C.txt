二、英文摘要 
 
        Low voltages in two stress modes and at three 
temperatures were applied to two kinds of 
p-channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect 
transistors (pMOSFETs) to investigate the sub-
strate current variations and hot-carrier 
(HC)-induced degradation. Contrary to conven-
tional concepts, this investigation reveals that the 
worst conditions for pMOSFET HC reliability 
involve channel HC (CHC) mode and high tem-
peratures. The severity of degradation of pMOS-
FETs has become comparable to their n-channel 
MOSFET (nMOSFET) counterparts. A probable 
damage mechanism is suggested to involve the 
generation of interface states owing to the integra-
tion of HCs and the negative-biased temperature 
effect (NBTI). A new empirical lifetime model is 
proposed in terms of applied voltages and tem-
peratures.

三、緣由與目的 
 
Many current and future generations of com-
plementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) 
integrated circuits are inevitably operated at high 
temperatures. State-of-the-art microprocessors re-
portedly have an average power density of over 
100 W/cm2 and the junction temperature often ex-
ceeds 100 ℃.1,2) Therefore, the hot-carrier (HC) 
reliability of metal-oxide-semiconductor 
field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) at high tem-
peratures must be reexamined. 
Conventionally, HCs have been reported at low 
temperatures, and their effect has been believed to 
be severer than at high temperatures.3,4) Addition-
ally, owing to the activation energy provided by 
the recombination of electrons and holes, MOS-
FETs in the drain avalanche HC (DAHC—stressed 
at maximal substrate current  
Ibm where Vg = 1/3~1/2Vd) mode have tradition-
ally been treated as the worst bias conditions.5-7) 
Provided cryogenic operation is unnecessary, then 
the DAHC at room temperature constitutes the 
worst stress condition for testing the HC reliability 
of MOSFETs. 
However, these concepts may have to be thor-
oughly modified as our study revealed that 
 4
ing Ibm as a monitor for DAHC-induced degrada-
tion or as a basis to forecast the device lifetime has 
becoming questionable for the region in which 
drain voltage is lower than the transition point.

  Fig. 2.  (Color online) Drain current degrada-
tion vs stress drain voltages at different tempera-
tures. Note that the 25℃ case has the worst degra-
dation but the degradation in the 125℃ case has 
become closer to that in the 75℃ case in the 
low-drain-voltage region. 
 
Also in Fig. 2, the degradation of the highest 
temperature case is seen to become closer to the 
75℃ one in the low-drain-voltage region. This im-
plies that elevated temperature gradually assumes 
a dominant role in the low-drain-voltage region. 
The situation becomes clear in Fig. 3, where 
curves of the various linear drain current degrada-
tion ratios versus stress time are plotted. The figure 
indicates that, in the DAHC stress mode, room 
temperature is associated with the worst degrada-
tion. This result is consistent with the conventional 
view that high temperature results in greater pho-
non scattering, which reduces the drain current and 
the impact ionization. However, in the CHC stress 
mode, temperature has a different effect. The tem-
perature of 75℃ is associated with the worst Id,lin 
degradation, and the CHC group obviously reveals 
worse degradation than the DAHC group. This is 
evidence that the worst conditions for a small-scale 
pMOSFET under HC stress gradually switch from 
DAHC to CHC and from low temperature to high 
temperature.

An attempt was made to create a model and elu-
cidate the degradation mechanism by applying the 
constant-current method to measure the linear 
threshold voltage Vt,lin immediately after each pe-
riod of stress. Figure 9 shows plots of the Vt,lin 
shifts of core devices on a log-log scale. All lines 
are almost parallel and obey the empirical time 
power law,

where A is a constant to be determined and t is the 
stress time in seconds. The last exponential term 
represents the probability of aggravating the deg-
radation at a critical voltage of β for the biased 
voltage of Vd = Vg and with γ as the activation en-
ergy at which the temperature effect causes dam-
age. k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the stress 
temperature in Kelvin. Both β = 15.1 V and γ = 
0.0602 eV can be determined mathematically from 
the tested data and verified, as shown in Figs. 10 
and 11, where they can be treated as being ap-
proximately independent of other parameters. 
Therefore, for a particular amount of degradation 
defined as the lifetime criterion (e.g., ΔVt,lin = 
0.03 V), the lifetime τ can be derived from eq. (1) 
and expressed as

where C is an another fitting constant. Therefore, 
this equation can be used to calculate the lifetimes 
at different operation voltages and temperatures. 
With respect to the time power law, n is about 
0.26 for the lines in Fig. 9. Actually, ΔVt,lin in 
DAHC and CHC stress modes for I/O devices 
were examined and the exponents of 6.0≈n and 
0.4 were obtained, respectively. This prompts us to 
recall a theory that the degradation induced by HC 
and NBTI is a result of the breaking of Si-H bonds 
on the dielectric/silicon interface and the n value 
depends on the one-dimension (for NBTI and 
n=0.25) or two-dimension (for HC and n=0.5) dif-
fusion of hydrogen.14) Since the CHC case has 
26.0≈n , it can be thought of as having been inte-
grated with NBTI, which makes it the worst stress 
mode for small-scale pMOSFETs. To further elu-
cidate the concept, core devices were also sub-
jected to NBTI tests, under the same relative con-
ditions. Figure 12 confirms once again that the 
degradation in the CHC case largely surpasses 
those in the NBTI and DAHC cases. Figure 13 
shows the ratios of reverse current degradation to

  On the basis of the 0.13 μm technology node, 
two kinds of pMOSFETs were stressed in different 
modes and at various temperatures. Their charac-
teristics were measured to clarify the HC-induced 
degradation. It was found that the worst case of 
HC-induced degradation on pMOSFETs switched 
from low temperature to high temperature and 
from the DAHC stress mode to the CHC stress 
mode, and the degradation was even greater than 
that in the case of NBTI. Furthermore, the severity 
of the degradation of pMOSFETs became compa-
rable to that of their nMOSFET counterparts. The 
results of analyzing the measured I-V data and 
power law behaviors indicated that the switching is 
due to the integration of HC and NBTI effects, in 
which the generation of interface states is involved 
in the degradation of the pMOS devices.
