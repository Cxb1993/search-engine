1. Introduction 
 
The applications of clean energy have attracted increasing attention due to the increase in the cost of fossil 
fuels and the concern over globe warming. Converting solar energy into hydrogen energy in a 
photoelectrochemical (PEC) system is thus an important technology in renewable-energy-related research fields 
[1-2]. Water splitting using a TiO2 photoelectrode and a platinum counter electrode in a PEC system under 
UV-light irradiation was reported by Fujishima and Honda [3]. However, the efficiency of hydrogen production 
from water using a TiO2 photoelectrode is limited due to its large band gap of 3.0-3.2 eV. In order to improve 
the PEC response of the TiO2 photocatalyst, various new materials have been developed [4-5]. Although metal 
oxides show good stability in aqueous solutions, the band structure of many metal oxides is not suitable for 
hydrogen production in the PEC process under solar irradiation [5-6]. In contrast, metal sulfides or metal 
selenide such as CdS or ZnSe are good hydrogen producers in aqueous electrolytes due to their suitable band 
edge position for reducing/oxidizing water [7]. However, some metal sulfides or metal selenide, such as CdS 
 was determined using surface profile measurements (Sloan Dektak 3030). The mobility, resistivity, and carrier 
concentrations of the samples were determined using room-temperature Hall measurements (Ecopia HMS-3000) 
with a magnetic flux of 0.51 T. 
The Mott-Schottky plots of the films on ITO-coated glass substrates were measured using a 
computer-controlled potentiostat (CHI 600 C) equipped with a frequency response analyzer. The measurements 
were carried out in an electrolyte solution of Na2S (0.35M) + K2SO3 (0.25M). For frequencies above 10 kHz, 
the equivalent circuit of samples in the electrolyte can be simplified into a resistance-capacitance (RC) circuit. 
The frequency of impendence was set to 10 kHz to measure the Mott-Schottky plots for various samples. The 
applied voltages were in the range of –1.2 V to 0.0 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode for Mott-Schottky 
measurements. The PEC performance measurements of the samples on ITO-coated glass substrates were 
carried out in a quartz electrolytic cell with the sample (average area=1.0 cm2), a Pt plate electrode (average 
area=1.0 cm2), and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. A 
silver wire was attached to the conducting layer of the working electrode with silver paste, and the back contact 
and edges of the working electrode were sealed with epoxy resin. Aqueous Na2S (0.35M) + K2SO3 (0.25M) 
solution was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte, prepared using double-deionized water and degassed by 
purging with nitrogen gas (99.99 % purity), was put into an ultrasonic bath for 30 min before each experiment 
in order to decrease the influence of gas solutes. All measurements were carried out in a nitrogen environment 
at a temperature of 25 oC. The current densities of samples as a function of applied potential (-0.7 ~ +1.0 V vs. 
Ag/AgCl electrode) was recorded with a computer-controlled potentiostat (CHI 600 C) for all PEC experiments. 
A 300-W Xe short arc lamp (Perkin Elmer PE300BF) with a white-light intensity of 100 mWcm-2 was 
employed to simulate solar light. The intensity of incident light from the Xe lamp was measured using a 
photometer (Newport 818P-15-19). 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 Characterization of samples on glass substrates 
 
AgInSe2 samples were grown on glass substrates using the selenization of Ag-In metal alloys. The 
[In]/[Ag+In] molar ratio in the metal precursors was varied to study its effect on the physical properties of the 
samples. Table 1 shows the [In]/[Ag+In] molar ratios in the as-deposited metal precursors on glass substrates 
obtained using EDAX analysis. The molar ratios of [In]/[Ag+In] in the as-deposited metal precursors were in 
the range of 0.36-0.62. Accord to phase diagram of Ag2Se and In2Se3 [20-21], the metal precursors and Se 
powders form binary β-Ag2Se and β-In2Se3 compounds with annealed temperature of above 221℃ With a 
selenization temperature in the range of 350 ℃, the following reaction takes place: 
 
Ag2S + In2Se3 → 2AgInSe2                  (1) 
 
In this study, a two-stage temperature profile was used for the selenization of metal precursors. At the first 
stage, the metal precursors and Se powders were annealed at 250 ºC for 30 min in order to incorporate Se into 
the metal precursors and form binary Ag2Se and In2Se3. The formation of AgInSe2 on the substrate was carried 
out at 550 ºC for 1 hour. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of samples on glass substrates in the 2θ range of 20-80º 
after a two stage of selenization process. The standard diffraction peaks of tetragonal AgInSe2 (JCPDS card no. 
75-118) and Ag2Se (JCPDS card no 24-1041) phases reported in JCPDS cards are also shown in Fig. 1. The 
XRD patterns show that all samples had the polycrystalline structure. The major phase of samples was the 
tetragonal AgInSe2 phase. With an increase in the [In]/[Ag+In] ratio in metal precursors on glass substrates 
(samples (A)-(H)), a small shift in peaks to higher angles was observed. This shift in peaks is reasonable 
because the ion radius of In3+ (0.76 Å) is smaller than that of Ag+ (1.14 Å) [22]. The successive shift of the 
XRD pattern indicates that In3+ ions were incorporated into the lattice of samples with an increase in the 
[In]/[Ag+In] ratio in metal precursors. With [In]/[Ag+In] molar ratios in metal precursors less than 0.46 
(samples (A)-(D)), 2θ peaks at 33.5°, 34.7° and 37.1° were observed, corresponding to the orthorhombic Ag2Se 
phase (JCPDS card no. 24-1041). This impurity was observed in samples (A)-(D) due to the lower [In]/[Ag+In] 
molar ratio in the metal precursors. The XRD patterns of samples on ITO-coated glass substrates verify these 
results. The thicknesses of samples obtained from surface profile measurements are listed in Table 1. The 
thicknesses range from 1.20 µm to 1.38 µm.  
The [In]/[Ag+In] and 2[Se]/([Ag]+3[In]) molar ratios obtained from EDAX analysis for AgInSe2 samples 
after the selenization process of Ag-In metal alloys are listed in Table 1. Fig. 2 shows the molar ratios of 
[In]/[Ag+In] and 2[Se]/([Ag]+3[In]) in the samples as functions of the [In]/[Ag+In] molar ratio in metal 
 Electrical properties 
 
The conduction type, carrier density, and mobility of samples on glass substrates were determined using 
room-temperature Hall measurements. The carrier density and mobility of samples were in the ranges of 
1.80×1013~1.30×1019 cm-3,5.3~87.5 cm2V-1s-1, respectively. All samples are n-type semiconductors. With an 
increase in [In]/[Ag+In] molar ratio in samples, both carrier density and mobility of samples on glass substrates 
decreased. Ag2Se is a high conductivity material and AgInSe2 is a low conductivity material [27-28]. With an 
increase in [In]/[Ag+In] molar ratio in samples, both carrier density and mobility of samples decrease because 
the samples change from solid mixture of Ag2Se and AgInSe2 to single AgInSe2 phase.  
An examination of the semiconductor/electrolyte Schottky barrier is important for PEC applications. The 
Mott-Schottky measurement method is based on the capacitance (C) of samples in an electrolyte vs. applied 
potential (E) [29]. The Mott-Schottky equation is: 
 
)](][)(2[1 202 ekTEEAeNBC FBD −−×= εε             (3) 
 
where ε is the dielectric constant of the sample, A is the surface area of the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, 
ND is the carrier density of the sample, EFB is the flat-band potential of the sample, e is the electric charge, and 
ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum. For an n-type semiconductor, B is 1, whereas for a p-type semiconductor, B 
is -1. EFB can be obtained from E0, the point of intersection of a C-2 vs. E plot with the E-axis: 
 
e
kTEE FB +=0                                 (4) 
Fig. 7 shows the Mott-Schottky plots for various samples in 0.35M Na2S + 0.25M K2SO3aqueous solution. 
Table 2 shows the values of flat-band potentials of the samples prepared in this study. The B value of 
Mott-Schottky plots is 1 for samples (A)-(H) in this study, indicating that they are n-type semiconductors. The 
results obtained from the Mott-Schottky plots agree well with those of room-temperature Hall measurements. 
The flat-band potentials of samples (A)-(H) lie in the range of –0.47V to -0.71 V vs. the normal hydrogen 
electrode (NHE) (-0.69 V to -0.93 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The position of the conduction band (ECB) for many n-type 
semiconductors is 0.1-0.3 V more negative than that of EFB [30]. The difference between ECB and EFB for an 
n-type semiconductor is thus assumed to be 0.3 V for determining the band positions of samples (A)-(H) by 
electrochemical measurements. The positions of the valence band (EVB) and conduction band (ECB) for the 
samples obtained using the direct energy band gaps from transmittance and reflectance spectra and flat-band 
potentials from Mott-Schottky plots are shown in Table 2.  
The PEC performances of AgInSe2 samples were measured to examine their suitability for solar energy 
applications. Fig. 8 shows the current density–applied voltage curves of the AgInSe2 samples in 0.35M Na2S + 
0.25M K2SO3 aqueous solution obtained using the chopping method with applied potentials in the range of -0.7 
to 1.0 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Samples (A)-(G) show a photo-enhancement effect in the positive 
potential area. When the applied potential (V vs. Ag/AgCl) was made more positive, the photo-enhancement 
current density of samples also increased, which indicates the samples (A)-(H) are n-type semiconductors, 
which agrees with the results of Hall measurements and Mott-Schottky plots. The onset of photocurrent density 
can be treated as a measure of the flat-band potential, EFB [31]. The flat-band potentials of samples obtained 
from photocurrent density-applied voltage measurements are shown in Table 2. The values of flat-band 
potentials determined from photocurrent density-applied voltage measurements are in the range of -0.41 ~ 0.47 
V vs. NHE. Sample (E) had the highest photo-enhancement current density of 31.8 mA/cm2 with the external 
bias kept at +1.0 V vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode. It was observed that the photocurrent density of samples with 
external bias kept at +1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl initially increased with increasing [In]/[Ag+In] molar ratio in the 
solution bath (samples (A)-(E)), and then decreased (samples (F)-(H)). The above results were probably due to 
a decrease of the crystal size in the samples. The PEC response of the semiconductor will be better due to a 
reduced of hole diffusion length of the semiconductor thin film in the PEC system [32]. However, if the crystal 
size of the samples is insufficient, the grain boundary will increase, implying increased charge recombination 
during the PEC reaction [33]. Therefore, the optimal crystal size of the semiconductor thin films is very 
important for PEC system application. These experimental results show the samples prepared in this study can 
be used as absorbers in the PEC application in the solutions.

Abstract—Copper indium disulfide (CuInS2) semiconductor 
layers were deposited on glass substrates or fluorine doped tin 
oxide coated glass substrates using the reactive sulfurization 
process with sputtering of Cu-In metal precursors. The effect 
of the [In]/[Cu+In] molar ratio in the metal precursors on the 
structural, optical, and electrical properties of samples was 
investigated. X-ray diffraction patterns and energy dispersive 
analysis of X-ray results reveal that the samples changed from 
the Cu-rich CuInS2 phase to the In-rich CuInS2 phase with an 
increase in the [In]/[Cu+In] molar ratio in metal precursors. 
The thicknesses and direct band gaps of the samples, 
determined from surface profile measurements and 
transmittance and reflectance spectra, are in the ranges of 
0.82-1.29 µm and 1.39~1.53 eV, respectively. When the 
[In]/[Cu+In] ratios in samples less than 0.50, the samples are p-
type semiconductors while when the [In]/[Cu+In] ratios in 
samples greater than 0.51, the samples are n-type 
semiconductors. It was found that the samples with an 
[In]/[Cu+In] molar ratio of 0.45 in CuInS2 sample had a 
maximum photo enhancement current density of 0.23 mAcm-2 
at an applied bias of -1.2 V vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode in contact 
with electrolyte containing 0.5 M K2SO4. 
 
Keywords- CuInS2, photoelectrode, sputtering 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
I-III-VI chalcopyrite semiconductors (I=Cu, Ag; III=Al, 
In, Ga; VI=S, Se, Te) have been developed for use in high 
efficiency thin film solar cells and photoelectrodes in a 
photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell for water splitting under 
light radiation [1-3]. Because of energy band gaps of these 
I-III-VI chalcopyrite semiconductors in the range of 0.8~2.0 
eV, they are good photo-absorbers in solar cells and PEC 
devices [4]. Laboratory scale thin film Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) 
solar cell has reached an efficiency of 20 % [5]. Another  
semiconductor, CuInS2 ternary chalcopyrite material with 
direct band gaps in the range of 1.3-1.5eV and an absorption 
coefficient around 105 cm-1 is suitable as the photo-absorber 
component in solar energy conversion systems [6]. CuInS2 
can be prepared to have either n- or p-type conductivity, 
depending on the synthesis method or the composition of 
elements in samples [7]. Theoretical conversion efficiency 
using homojunction CuInS2 is as high as 28% and it can also 
be used in tandem structures with CuInSe2 [8]. The 
efficiency of CuInS2 solar cell prepared from sputtered 
materials subsequently sulfurized using rapid thermal 
processing (RTP) in sulfur vapor was 11.4% [9]. 
Recently, an interesting reactive sulfurization approach 
for the deposition of CuInS2 film has been reported [10-12]. 
The sulfurization of Cu-In metal precursors can be done in a 
gas mixture containing Ar and H2S or in the presence of 
element sulfur. The reactive sulfurization of a metal alloy is 
a simple method for obtaining large-area and high-quality 
photo active thin films. Few studies have reported the 
synthesis, characterization and PEC performance of CuInS2 
films prepared using the reactive sulfurization of Cu-In 
metal precursors. In the present study, CuInS2 samples on 
various substrates were prepared using the reactive 
sulfurization process with sputtering of Cu-In metal 
precursors. The effect of the [Cu]/[In] multilayer metal 
precursor on the structural, optical, and PEC responses of 
the CuInS2 samples was studied.  
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL DTAILS 
In this study, metal precursors with an In-Cu bi-layer 
(Cu/In/substrate) structure were deposited on glass 
substrates or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, sheet resistance 
= 10 Ωsquare-1) coated glass substrates using the magnetron 
radio frequency (RF)-sputtering at ambient temperature with 
2 in. Cu and In element targets. After the deposition 
chamber was evacuated to the base pressure of 5×10-6 Tor, 
high purity (99.995 %) argon gas was used to provide the 
plasma at a base pressure of 2.5 mTorr. The RF sputtering 
power was kept at 20 W. The [In]/[Cu+In] molar ratio in 
metal precursors was in the range of 0.3-0.6. 
The Cu-In metal precursors and sufficient elemental 
sulfur were placed in the container made of Al2O3 and 
loaded into an evacuated quartz tube. Sulfurization of metal 
precursors was carried out at various reaction temperatures 
in order to determine suitable conditions for the formation 
of single phase CuInS2 for one hour.  
The crystallographic study of samples on glass 
substrates was conducted using an X-ray diffractometer 
(Siemems Model D5005) with CuKα (λ = 1.5405 Å) 
radiation. The surface microstructures of the samples were 
studied using a field-emission scanning electron microscope 
(FE-SEM, model JEOL JSM 6700F). The compositions of 
the samples on glass substrates were analyzed using a 
scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy 
dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX, model Hitachi S-
VI2 ternary compounds have direct band gaps [18-19]. Fig 6 
and Table 1 showed direct band gaps of samples. When the 
[In]/[Cu+In] molar ratios in the samples were increased 
from 0.32 to 0.55, the direct band gap of the samples 
increased from 1.39 to 1.53 eV. Das et al. [20] also reported 
the same results. The direct band gaps of bulk crystalline 
CuInS2 were in the range of 1.3-1.5eV [20].  The values of 
energy band gap for samples (a)-(e) were close to the value 
reported for bulk crystalline CuInS2. Samples (f) and (g) had 
higher optical band gaps than that of bulk CuInS2, which 
may due to some defects in the crystalline lattice or an 
impurity phase in the samples. The band gap of In2S3 is 
about 2.6 eV [21]. The band gaps of samples (f) and (g) lie 
between the band gaps of CuInS2 and In2S3 because samples 
(f) and (g) are solid mixtures of In2S3 and CuInS2. Similar 
results have been reported in the literature [20]. 
The PEC performances of CuInS2 samples were carried 
out to examine their possibility of solar energy applications. 
Fig. 7 shows the current density –applied voltages of the 
CuInS2 samples in 0.5 M K2SO4 aqueous solution using the 
chopping method with the applied potentials in the range 
between -1.2 to 0.4 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. 
In aqueous K2SO4 aqueous solution, the water is oxidized 
by holes generated in the valance band of samples when the 
applied potential is more positive than the flat band potential 
of the sample. Water is reduced to hydrogen by the electrons 
produced in the conduction band of samples, accompanied 
by oxidation of H2O under illumination. With 0.5 M K2SO4 
solution as the electrolyte, the following reactions occur:

The photo-enhancement current density for the samples is 
defined as the difference between photo-current density and 
dark-current density. It is observed that the photo-
enhancement current densities of samples (a), (b), (c) and (d) 
were 0.08, 0.21, 0.23 and 0.07 mA/cm2 at the external 
potential -1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. Samples (a)-(d) 
show the photo-enhancement effects on the negative 
potential area. With applied voltage (V vs. Ag/AgCl) in 
samples moved to more negative, the photo-enhancement 
current density of all samples also increases, which indicates 
the samples in this study are n-type semiconductors. The 
photo-enhancement current densities of samples (e), (f) and 
(g) were 0.18, 0.22 and 0.20 mA/cm2 at the external 
potential +0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. With an 
increase in applied voltage (V vs. Ag/AgCl) in samples (e)-
(g), the photo-enhancement current density of all samples 
also increases, which indicates the samples in this study are 
n-type semiconductors. For p-type CuInS2 samples, sample 
(c) shows the maximum photo-enhancement current density 
with external bias kept at -1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode. For 
n-type semiconductors, the PEC response of samples (e)-(g) 
in 0.5 M K2SO4 aqueous solutions also show the same 
trends. Samples (f) shows the maximum PEC response in 
0.5 M K2SO4 aqueous solution because of its higher carrier 
density of n-type samples. The XRD patterns of sample (g) 
show some impurity such as In2S3 in samples, which results 
in the decrease of PEC performance of sample (g).  The 
stability of sample (f) was tested with the external bias kept 
at +0.4 V vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode in 0.5 M K2SO3 aqueous 
solution. Fig. 11 shows the current density of sample (f) as a 
function of time for 1000 s using chopping method. The 
current density of sample (b) changed from 0.38 mA/cm2 to 
0.18 mA/cm2 during the course of the experiment. 
 
CONCLUSION 
In this study, ternary CuInS2 samples were deposited on 
glass substrates or FTO coated glass substrates using the 
reactive sulfurization process with sputtering of Cu-In metal 
precursors. The influence of the [In]/[Cu+In] atomic ratio in 
the Cu-In metal precursors on the structural, optical, and 
PEC properties of CuInS2 samples was investigated. XRD 
results show that the samples are the polycrystalline 
tetragonal CuInS2 phase. Some impurities (CuS and In2S3 
phase) were observed for [In]/[Cu+In] atomic ratios in the 
metal precursors of below than 0.36 or higher than 0.56. The 
thicknesses and the direct energy band gaps of the samples 
were in the ranges of 0.82-1.29 µm and 1.39-1.53 eV, 
respectively.When the [In]/[Cu+In] ratios in samples less 
than 0.50, the samples are p-type semiconductors while 
when the [In]/[Cu+In] ratios in samples greater than 0.51, 
the samples are n-type semiconductors. At an irradiation of 
100 mW/cm2 from a Xe lamp, the highest photo-
enhancement current density of samples obtained in this 
study was 0.23 mAcm-2 at an external potential of – 1.2 V 
vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode in 0.5 M K2SO4 solution (pH = 
7.0). These results show that the physical properties of 
CuInS2 can be controlled by changing the [Cu]/[Cu+In] 
molar ratio in the metal precursor using reactive 
sulfurization process with sputtering of Cu-In metal 
precursors.

nitrate [In(NO3)3], 2.5 mL of 0.4 M ammonium nitrate 
(NH4NO3, buffer solution), 1.08 mL of 3.7 M 
triethanolamine [C6H15NO3, chelating agent], and 20 mL of 
0.2M sodium citrate. In order to prevent the formation of 
hydroxide-complexes such as In(OH)3, concentrated sulfuric 
acid was added into the cationic solution to adjust the pH 
value of the solution bath to around 0.5. After the cationic 
solution was stirred for 1~2 hour, 30mL of 0.4 M 
thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2, TAA) solution, the source of S2- 
ions, was added and mixed well. Pre-cleaned substrates 
were placed vertically into the solution bath. The bath was 
placed on a hot plate and magnetically stirred to improve the 
uniformity of samples. The temperature of the solution was 
kept at 80 oC in order to increase the reaction rate. After the 
deposition, the samples were removed and cleaned 
ultrasonically in a water bath for 5 min in order to obtain 
uniform and compact samples. The thermal treatment of 
samples was carried out in a vacuum quartz tube at 450 oC 
for 1 hour after CBD.  
The crystallographic study of films was conducted using 
an X-ray diffractometer (Siemems Model D5005) with 
CuKα (λ = 1.5405
o
A ) radiation. The X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) patterns were recorded in the 2θ range of 10 to 70o. 
The surface microstructures of the samples were studied 
using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-
SEM, model JEOL JSAM 6700F). The compositions of the 
samples were also analyzed using a scanning electron 
microscope (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive analysis 
of X-ray (EDAX, model Hitachi S-3000N). The spectral 
transmittance and reflectance of the samples were measured 
using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating 
sphere (JASCO Model V-670) in the wavelength range of 
400~800 nm at room temperature. The thickness of the 
samples was determined using a surface profiler (Surfcorfer 
ET 3000).  
The PEC performance measurements of the samples 
were carried out in a quartz electrolytic cell with the sample 
(average area=1.0 cm2), a Pt plate electrode (average 
area=1.0 cm2), and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the working, 
counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Aqueous 
0.35 M Na2S and 0.25M K2SO3 solutions was used as the 
electrolytes. Current densities, as a function of applied 
potential (-1.0 ~ + 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode) for the 
samples, were recorded under illumination using chopping 
method with a computer-controlled potentiostat (CHI 600 C) 
for all PEC experiments. A 300 W Xe short arc lamp 
(Perkin Elmer Model PE300BF) with a white light intensity 
of 100 mW/cm2 was employed to simulate solar light. The 
intensity of incident light from the Xe lamp was measured 
using a photometer (Model 818P-15-19, Newprot).  
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Fig. 1(I) shows the XRD diffraction patterns of 
samples in the 2θ range of 10~70。with various [Ga]/[Ga+In] 
molar ratios in solution baths. All samples showed the 
polycrystalline cubic spinel AgIn5S8 phase. Fig. 1 (II) show 
the (311) crystal plan of XRD patterns of same with various 
[Ga]/[Ga+In] ratio in solution. As the molar ratio of 
[Ga]/[Ga+In]  in solution bath increased (samples (a)→(f)), 
the peaks of XRD patterns of samples shifted to higher 
angle. The successive shift of the XRD pattern indicated 
that the Ga  as incorporated into the lattice of samples with a 
increase in [Ga]/[Ga+In] molar ratio in solution.  
The Fig. 2 also shows the atomic ratios of [Ga]/[Ga+In] 
and [2S]/[Ag+3(In+Ga)] in the samples as functions of the 
[In]/[Ga+ In] atomic ratio in precursor solution. The atomic 
ratios of  [Ga]/[Ga+In] and [2S]/[Ag+3(In+Ga)]  were in the 
ranges of 0.00~0.06 and 0.78~0..64, respectively. With an 
increase in the [Ga]/[Ga+In]  ratio in solution bath, the  
[Ga]/[Ga+In] atomic ratio in AgIn5S8 samples increased. 
The [2S]/[Ag+3(In+Ga)] atomic ratios in all AgIn5S8 
samples are less than 1.0, which indicates some sulphur 
deficits in the samples.  
Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of samples (a), (c), (d) 
and (f) at 40K(X). Diamond-like microstructures were on 
the surfaces of samples (a), (c) and (d). With [Ga]/[Ga+In] 
ratio of 0.9 in solution bath, platelet-like microstructures an 
be observed on the surface of sample.  
The thicknesses of samples obtained from surface 
profile measurements are in the ranges of 270~ 680 nm. 
They are listed in Table 1. The atomic ratios of [Ga]/[Ga+In] 
and [2S]/[Ag+3(In+Ga)] for samples using energy 
dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) are listed in Table 1. 
With an increasing in [Ga]/[Ga+In]  molar ratios in solution 
(samples (a)~(f)), [Ga]/[Ga+In]  in samples increase. The 
EDAX analysis of samples also shows that there was some 
significant sulphur deficit in the samples.  
The transmittance and reflectance spectra of samples in 
the wavelength of 400 ~ 800 nm are shown in Fig. 4, 
respectively. The maximum transmittance spectra of 
samples in this study approach 70 % transparency in the 
near infrared region. The reflectance spectra of samples 
were in the range of 20 – 30 % in the wavelength of 400-
800 nm. The energy band gaps (Eg) of samples are 
important properties for solar cell and PEC device 
applications. The absorption coefficients (α) of samples can 
be estimated using the Manifacier model [1]. The 
relationship between the absorption coefficient (α) and the 
incident photon energy (hv) can be written as:      
  
  
nEghvhv )()( −=α             (1) 
Generally, n is 1/2 for a direct and indirect band gap of 
samples [1]. The optical band gaps of samples can be 
obtained by plotting (αhν)1/n with respect to hv and 
extrapolating it to (αhν)1/n = 0. Fig. 5 (I) and (II) shows the 
linear dependence of (αhν)0.5 on hv and (αhν)2 on hv.  
Table. 1 shows the direct and indirect band gap of samples 
obtained form the plots of linear dependence of (αhν)1/n on 
hv. The direct and indirect energy band gaps of samples
