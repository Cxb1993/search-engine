ABSTRACT 
Since the enforced regulation executed in Taiwan on June 1St of 1997, the death rate due to 
the head trauma resulted from car accident has dropped dramatically. However, in contrast to the 
23 % decrease rate of head trauma cause the death rate resulted from chest or spine was increased 
by 22%. The statistic analysis shows that the thorax, spine, as well as knee and tibia are the most 
frequent injure segments.  
Most of body protect devices are focused on either head such as helmet, or four limbs such 
as arm or knee guard. However, except head those limb injuries rarely result in traumatic death. 
The idea of using air jacket for motorist body protection has been invented for recent years. But 
no biomechanical support the effect of protection. Spine is the most organ to be injured but few 
study to investigate the spinal column injury of motorcyclist when impact. 
The purpose of this study is to combine the dynamic mode analysis, biomechanics impact 
test, and finite element analysis to evaluate the mechanism of body injury and further to develop 
an effective protective device-air jacket. The studywas proposed for three years : 
1) the first year using ADMAS software to evaluate the impact of body segments during 
crash, and biomechanical evaluation of prototype air jacket.  
The conclusions of present study are 
1. The head-on, Lateral and Rear end collision resulted in serious injury on the head at time of 
Impact occurrence, while dropped to the floor back and sacrum were in fatal injury. 
2. All collision resulted in fatal damage on lower cervical spine segments (C3 to C7). Among that, 
the lateral impact was more profound and had serious injury over the back. 
3. The extremities were suffered impact fractures in all the collision cases; therefore, additional 
protection is needed to prevent limbs from bone fracture. 
4. The body segments of head, chest, spine and back are all exposed in dangerous especial after 
cullied with floor, therefore, the prevention device should cover as much as body surfaces as 
possible. 
5. The cervical spine needs external protect to eliminate the external torsion and whiplash effect 
and results in cervical spine rupture. 
6. The suitable intake pressure for air jacket liner is about 57 torrs. 
 
 
2) The second year was to investigate the advert effect of the helmet in cervical spine 
injury .impact of motorcycle in crash, the biomechanical evaluation of kinematics and kinetics of 
motorcyclist when crash. 
 
A ligamentary finite element model of head to C7 was modeled and analyzed using 
LS-DYNA3D. The results showed that at 3.2 m/s impact speed, without wearing the helmet the 
highest effective stresses were located at the posterior of C3-4 disc, the values are 83.5Mpa ( at 
time of 8.8 msec) and 57.9 Mpa ( 4.2 msec) for 15o and -15o impact angle, respectively. After 
wearing the helmet, the maximum stress was located at C7-T1 and it increased to 92.9 Mpa (18.3 
msec) and 77.8Mpa (23.6msec) for +15o, respectively. For 0o impact, wearing helmet or not, the

with a velocity of 3.2 m/s^2. The experiment proceeded with 11 head-neck complex of cadaver, 
which connected to a 16kg mass replacing the torso, impacting onto rigid and padded surfaces. 
The determination of injury occurrence was done by a decrease in axial load with increasing 
cervical spine deformation. Force history of head and T1 showed lower impact forces in bimodal 
phases in the padded surface. Nightingale et al founded the inertial effect of neck by the head is 
large enough to constrain head end condition even there is no physical constraint of head motion 
(pocketing surface), and this is more evident when no tangent component of head impact velocity. 
Rebound phases were discussed that forces measured at cervical spine are sometimes even larger 
than that measured at the head. It was found that head mass could provide sufficient constraint to 
cause cervical spine injury in the absence of head pocketing. Secondly, observed head motion 
head motion and dynamic buckling modes of cervical spine were not directly associated with 
injury but might alter kinematics and consequently types of injury. 
Yoganandan et al (Yogonandan, 1986) conducted vertical impact experiments using 
head-neck complex of cadavers. Differences were found between restrained and unrestrained 
head specimens; heads were restrained to simulate neck muscle forces, although the restraining 
system didn’t replace the physiological restraints of muscle tone, but it did suggest the 
importance of muscle contraction for cervical spine injury. Head impact force of 3000-7000N 
were recorded for unrestrained-head specimens, and 9800-14600N for the restrained-head 
specimens. Forces of 1100-2600N were recorded by force gauge inserted between C5/C6, 
cervical vertebral body fracture occurred with forces of 2600N at C5; Factors that may influence 
cervical fractures include restrains either by muscle or impact surface properties, dynamic 
responses like rotation and rebound, load sharing ability of posterior processes in column 
buckling and extension, and the following torso while head remains contact with a surface. 
Ultimate tensile failure stress of 81-95.6MPa and 161.8MPa for compressive failure stress are 
surveyed for cortical bone of human spine (Evans, 1974; Beaupied, 2007). 
Numerical approach 
With the advantage of numerical simulation, such as finite element analysis, researchers 
(Yang, 1998; Camacho, 1999; Brolin, 2005; Teo, 2007) investigated local injury mechanism in 
the head-neck complex (Figure 1.20). LS-DYNA dynamic finite element was used for crash 
impact analysis on head-neck complex by a majority of researchers (Chancey, 2003; Cheng, 2004; 
Brolin, 2005; Teo, 2007). Tolerance of neck injury and criteria of neck injury have been the focus 
in these studies; Tolerance of neck injury criteria was reduced from skeletal cervical spine model 
to ligamentous cervical spine; and further, with neck musculature, the tensile tolerance of neck 
was studied by Chancey et al (Chancey, 2003) that ligamentous cervical spine failed in tension of 
1.8kN, and it failed in tension of 4.8kN with total neck muscle activation, lastly, it failed in 
tension of 3.1kN to 3.7kN with optimized neck muscle activation for relaxed and tensed state, 
respectively. Nightingale’s experiment (Nightingale, 1996) was utilized by Camacho et al 
(Camacho, 1999), it’s founded that increases in friction coefficient (0.0~1.0) of impact surface do 
contribute to the post-buckled resultant neck forces in 40%, peak resultant head acceleration in 
9.8%, and HIC values in 43%, and therefore suggested minimization of friction between head and 
impact surface may reduce the risk of head and neck injury in near-vertex head impact.

with a number of element of 12055 (13591 nodes). The rigid for impact surface is consisted of a 
number of element of 2400 (5082 nodes). The upper torso model is constructed from the Hybrid 
III dummy using SolidWork 2006, and then meshed by ANSYS 9. The geometry shape of upper 
torso model is identical to that of Hybrid III dummy without interior components; the fourth part 
is the neck muscles, and it includes 8 groups of neck muscles (longus colli, anterior scalene, 
medium scalene, posterior scalene, semispinalis capitis, splenius cervicis, sternocleidomastoid, 
trapezius). the neck muscles are modeled with discrete beam element, and the material property 
of neck muscles are *MAT_Spring_Muscle.  
The upper torso geometry is identical in that of geometry of Hybrid-III dummy, the original 
model consists of shell elements and thus needs solidifying and remeshing. The upper torso 
model composed of 3D solid elements is connected to the head and neck model via extra node 
constraint. Using solid element instead of shell element for torso modeling is for convenience of 
assigning the center of mass of the torso in LS-DYNA. Center of mass and moment of inertia are 
assigned for the upper torso. The center of mass, moment of inertia, and mass of the torso are 
from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  
For muscle modeling in LS-DYNA, the element type used id damper and spring; the 
property is discrete element; the material type is *MAT_spring_muscle. Muscle parameters in 
modeling include Initial muscle length (Lo), Maximum CE shortening velocity (Vmax), Scale 
factor for Vmax vs. active state (Sv): coefficient/load curve, Activation level vs. time function, 
Peak isometric force (Fmax), Active tension vs. length function (TL): coefficient/load curve, 
Active tension vs. velocity function (TV): coefficient/load curve, Force vs. length function for 
parallel elastic element (FPE): coefficient/load curve/ exponential function, Relative length when 
FPE reaches Fmax, required if FPE=0 (Lmax), Constant governing exponential rise of FPE, 
required if FPE=0 (KSH). Eight groups of muscles in neck are modeled with finite element 
software, LS-DYNA; 3 groups of muscles are extensors, which are longus capitis, semispinalis 
capitis, and splenius cervicis; 5 groups are flexors, which are scalenus anterior, scanlenus 
medium, scalenus posterior, sternocleidomastoid, and trapezius. These eight groups of neck 
muscles are modeled for, firstly, limited modeling material properties in literatures, and secondly 
these groups of muscles in human neck are of major contributors of head-neck motions (Brolin, 
2005; Chancey, 2003; Deng, 1984; Oi, 2004, Janet, 2005). As for neck muscles origin and 
insertion, these connections are done according to anatomy and 3D anatomy software. The 
numbers of strands and weighting of neck muscles are referred to Chancey et al (Chancey, 2003). 
The dynamic behaviors of the head-neck-torso complex are validated with regard to 
volunteer study in National Naval Biodynamics Laboratory (NBDL) by Ewing et al (Ewing, 
1976a, b). The experimental setup of volunteer sled-test is briefly introduced as follows: subject 
on the sled experiences peak sled acceleration profile of 15G. The subjects were seated in an 
upright position and restrained with shoulder, lap, and chest belts. The initial condition of 
head-neck posture is in neutral position (neck-up and chin-up). The duration of sled acceleration 
profile recorded in Ewing et al is up to 300 milliseconds. Head angular acceleration, head angular 
velocity, and head resultant acceleration are recorded for analysis.  
For current model validation, a velocity of 16.7 m/s (60km/h) is applied to the whole model

 Table 1 showed the highest stress distribution in C5-6 disc among all cervical discs in all 
crash simulations, C7-T1 was with the second highest stress distribution. High stress distribution 
located at posterolateral of discs and discs failed in a very short time, 0.19ms, after the skull hit 
the ground; initial stress levels were much larger than disc injury threshold for under such an 
extreme condition like motorcycle-car crash. That means discs failed as the head impacts to the 
ground.  
 
 Stress distribution of C1 and C2 were illustrated in Figure 10 to Figure 15 with Tables 2 to

Conclusions 
1. The developed head-neck-torso with neck muscles was validated and the results were within 
and in similar trend with regard to the volunteer experiments.  
2. Results of injury simulation show that more injury occurs in cortical bone for model without 
activated neck muscles; and more injury in vertebraes occurs due to contact force when neck 
muscles are not activated, in comparison to that with activated neck muscles.  
3. The effects of neck muscles have influences on cervical spine injury during crash 
simulations, the effect of neck muscles activation can be seen since more injury occurs in 
vertebraes due to higher stress for the model with neck muscles activation; more 
ligamentous injury occurs in model with activated neck muscles.  
4. Intervertebral disc prolapse can be observed frequently in C5-6 in all types of crash 
simulations, which are commonly seen clinically. 
5. Severe cervical spine injuries were found in three types of crash simulations, head-on crash 
resulted in severe cervical spine injury with neck coupled motion. C1 and C2 were injured 
most frequently in all simulations; high stress located at T1, which exceeded the injury 
threshold, it was because T1 was the boundary of extra node connection. Fracture of dens 
and fracture of atlas were primary injury types in all crash simulations. 1st mode shape was 
found in all three types of crash simulations and no 2nd mode shape was found in all 
simulations; and curvatures of cervical spine in multi-plane are found in head-on crash 
simulation.

ABSTRACT 
The incident rate of spinal cord injury is about 1200 cases 
per year in Taiwan, mainly due to the motorcycle accident. 
About 30% of the spinal cord injury and bone fracture is 
located at the lumbar spine region.  The purpose of this 
study was to investigate the possible lumbar spine injury 
pattern in four types of car-motorcycle accidents. A 
ligamentous finite element L1 to L5 lumbar spine model 
with spinal canal was modeled and analyzed using LS-
DYNA3D. The simulation included: rear impact, front 
impact, lateral impact and side impact.  
The results showed that the severest bone fracture 
was in the case of frontal impact, the max principle stress 
of 305 Mpa was located at the pedicle base of L5. The 
frontal impact also leaded the largest right-lateral disc 
bulge at the L1-2, the bulge was 4.84 mm. The maximum 
spinal canal stenosis of 2.74 mm was due to the first mode 
of spinal column buckling in the simulation of lateral 
impact at the L1. 
The combination impact forces of lateral bending and 
compression such as the frontal impact, or lateral bending 
and torsion (lateral impact) is the vital condition to cause 
spinal cord injury and vertebral body fracture.    
  
KEY WORDS 
Motorcycle accident, Lumbar spine fracture, spinal cord 
injury, 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The motorcycle is a convenient transportation carrier 
especial in the high populous area. There are about 13-
million licensed motorcycles in Taiwan. The traffic 
accidents are about 2770 cases per year and among that 
34% are motorcycle involved with 670 cases of spinal 
cord injury [1]. During the accident occurrence, the body 
is rolling over and the spine column may impact on either 
ground or other objects.  This results in a spinal injury [2].  
Robertson et al. collected 1121 cases of motorcyclist’s 
involved traffic accidents and found that about 24% was 
spinal  injury, in which 54.8% was in thoracic region, 
29.4% in lumbar spine and 27 % was in the cervical spine. 
They concluded the multiple level injuries were common 
[3]. When the lumbar spine is impacted, the vertebral 
body fracture, end plate rupture as well as the facet joint 
rupture is observed [4]. Pasapular et al. found that the 
wedge compression facture at the anterior of vertebral 
body was common, and the   flexion-distraction fracture 
was seen on the car accident due to the seat belt restraint. 
For a high altitude drop impact, the spinal injury had the 
fracture-dislocation pattern mainly located at the L1 level 
[5].  
In vitro studies showed the axial compression load 
resulted in the end-plate rupture and the nucleus pulpous 
penetrated into the vertebral body [6]. The high impact 
energy caused the spinal canal encroachment and had at 
risk to develop neurological deficit [7,8]. The static finite 
element simulation also indicated that high loading rate 
would introduce the endplate and pedicle cortex fracture 
[9,10,11]. For the high rate axial impact, fracture occurred 
in the posterior region of the vertebral body producing a 
wedge fracture, the fragment was projected into the spinal 
canal but confined by the posterior longitudinal ligament 
[12] 
The finite element modeling of spine motion segment 
was first introduced by Belytschko in 1973, since then 
there are many spine static and dynamic simulations. The 
loading conditions of these modeling were either axial 
compression or combined compression-torsion acted over 
the L1 vertebral body, but none of the modeling can 
simulate the reality of complicate acting loads on the 
spinal column. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the injury patterns of lumbar spine in four 
condition of car-motorcycle crush. The location of bone 
fracture and occlusion of spinal canal were most 
interested.   
 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1 Model construction 
 
The original ligamentous finite element L1 to L5 lumbar 
spine model was developed by Chang (1994) [13] from a 
L4-5 CT image and then anatomically transferred to a L1-
5 spinal column.  The ANSYS format was then 
580-040 180
References 3.3 Case 3: Lateral impact 
  
In lateral impact, the maximum stress was same at the L5 
pedicle (227.5Mpa) at time of 7.2ms. The encroachment 
of spinal canal was maximum (2.744mm) at L1, the disc 
bulge was 3.003mm .(Fig 5)

The stress and disc bulge were lowest in this case, the 
maximum of 90.38Mpa principle stress was at L5 anterior 
vertebra.

Loading Rate. Spine. 20, 1984-1988. 
In summary the severest bone fracture was in the case 
of frontal impact, the max principle stress of 305 Mpa 
was located at the pedicle base of L5. The frontal impact 
also leaded the largest right-lateral disc bulge at the L1-2, 
the bulge was 4.84 mm. The maximum spinal canal 
stenosis of 2.74 mm was due to the first mode of spinal 
column buckling in the simulation of lateral impact at the 
L1 .  The vertebral bone fracture due to different impact 
condition is shown in Table 3.

4. Conclusion 
 
The combination impact forces of lateral bending and 
compression such as the frontal impact, or lateral bending 
and torsion (lateral impact) is the vital condition to cause 
spinal cord injury and vertebral body fracture.
