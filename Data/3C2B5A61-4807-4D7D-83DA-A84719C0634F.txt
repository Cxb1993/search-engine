addressing the drawbacks of the integration of EPC and SPC. That is, although the good feature of fault 
compensation can be achieved by using EPC, it results in insensitivity of the SPC monitoring capability. In 
this study, we propose the combination of SPC, EPC and artificial neural network (SPC/EPC/ANN) and SPC, 
EPC and support vector machine (SPC/EPC/SVM) mechanisms to solve the insensitivity of SPC monitoring 
problem. Using the proposed mechanisms, we are able to effectively detect the starting time of a fault in an 
autocorrelated process. The superiority of the proposed approaches is also demonstrated with the use of 
simulated examples. 
The structure of this study is organized as follows. The following section discusses the difficulty of 
SPC/EPC system for monitoring an autocorrelated process. The basic concepts for the EPC are introduced in 
this section as well. Section 3 introduces the proposed approaches for detecting the fault of a process. Section 
4 demonstrates a series of simulations which are used to report the performance of the typical and the 
proposed approaches. The final section concludes this study. 
 
2. Problem Statement 
The integration of SPC and EPC has become a promising research in recent years, and the benefits have 
been reported in several studies [18-20]. One of the important features of using proper EPC is the 
compensation of the fault, and consequently, the resulting process observations should be independent to each 
other. That is, the use of proper EPC is able to remove the autocorrelation among the observations. The 
traditional SPC chart is then able to monitor these independent observations. However, the way of using EPC 
to remove the autocorrelation has a drawback. When a proper EPC is used to tune the process, the 
autocorrelation structure is not only removed, but also the effects of the fault. This results in the problem in 
which a fault can not sensitively be detected by the SPC charts. Therefore, even when the autocorrelation is 
removed by a proper EPC, the SPC charts still can not effectively detect such faults. As a consequence, the 
resulting average run length (ARL) would be larger than the exact ARL. 
Consider a zero order process with an AR(1) noise [19]: 
 
 11 ++ += ttt dqXY , 
( )B

where 
:1+tY  the output deviation at time t+1, 
:tX  deviation from the manipulate variable at time t, 
:q  the process parameter, 
:1+ta  the white noise at time t+1, and they are iid with normal distribution. 
:1+td  the noise. 
A minimum mean squared error (MMSE) control is commonly used to tune the process [14-15]. To 
compensate for the noise, dt, it is can be shown that the following MMSE control action can be obtained: 
 
 
ttttt Yq

In addition, substituting Equation (2) into Equation (1), the following equation holds: 
 
 11 ++ = tt aY  (3)
 
Equation (3) implies that the output deviations from the target would follow a sequence of white noise, and 
therefore, these output deviations from the target are independent to each other. Consequently, it is appropriate 
to use the SPC charts to monitor the output deviations when a suitable EPC control action is used to tune the

most commonly utilized to date. Consequently, sigmoid function is used in this study. 
The generalized delta rule is the conventional technique used to derive the connection weights of the 
feedforward network [23]. Initially, a set of random numbers is assigned to the connection weights. Then for a

Note that the learning rate affects the network's generalization and the learning speed to a great extent. 
 
3.2 SVM.  
The concept about support vector machine was initially addressed by [37]. It became an attractive learning 
method due to the successful kernel-based framework [38]. Basically, the aim of SVM is to find a hyperplane 
in the middle of the most separated margins between two classes; so that, this hyperplane can be applied for 
classifying the new testing samples. In addition, the SVM has been successfully implemented in different 
areas, and they can be referenced by [39-44]. 
The use of SVM algorithm can be described as follows. Let ( ){ }Niii y 1, =x , di R∈x , { }1 ,1−∈iy  be the training 
set with input vectors and labels. Here, N is the number of sample observations and d is the dimension of each 
observation, iy  is known target. The algorithm is to seek the hyperplane 0=+⋅ bixw , where w is the vector 
of hyperplane and b is a bias term, to separate the data from two classes with maximal margin width 2/2 w , 
and the all points under the boundary is named support vector. In order to obtain the optimal hyperplane, the 
SVM was used to solve the following optimization problem [45]:  
 
Min 2
2
1)( wx =Φ  
s.t. Niby iTi ..., ,2 ,1 ,1)( =≥+xw  (8)
 
It is difficult to solve Equation (8), and we need to transform the optimization problem to the dual problem 
by Lagrange method. The value of α  in the Lagrange method must be non-negative real coefficients. The 
Equation (8) is transformed into the following constrained form [45]: 
 6
where 
n: the number of binomial experiments (i.e, it is equivalent to column 2 of Table 1), 
x: the number of success in n experiments (i.e., , it is equivalent to column 4 of Table 1), and 
p: the probability of obtaining the outcome of success in an experiment (i.e., it is equivalent to the correct 
identification rate of the ANN model). 
By observing Table 1, we can notice that the cumulative probability is 0.905 at sampling number 128. Since 
the probability of 0.905 is high, we could conclude that the process fault has occurred at time 128 (instead of 
time 136). One thing we have to notice that the cumulative probability should be high in order to have strong 
confidence for determining the starting time of a fault. 
 
4. Simulation Studies 
This study combines the methodologies of ANN and SVM with binomial experiments to establish the fault 
detection models to overcome the deficiency of SPC/EPC systems. In order to show the efficiency of the 
proposed approaches, this study performs a series of simulations. The results are reported and discussed.

Again, suppose a process is represented in Equation (1) in which q=0.3, 8.0=φ  and the variance of the 
white noise is 1. This autocorrelated process is tuned with the use of MMSE control action, Equation (2). 
After time 101, a fault has intruded in the process, and the process has been represented as in Equation (4). 
To use the ANN and SVM, we need to design the structure of the ANN and SVM models. All training data 
sets include 20 simulation runs’ data vectors. For a single simulation run, the first 100 observations are all 
from an in-control state (i.e., no fault involved), and after time 101, the remaining data are all from an 
out-of-control state (i.e., a fault was intruded into the process after 101) with different values of δ . The last 
collected observation in a simulation run is the time in which the SPC signal was triggered. In this study, two 
types of training data sets were developed for the autocorrelated process series. The first and the second 
training data sets were generated in the cases of 1=δ  and ,2=δ  respectively. These two different values of 
δ  represent the small and moderate values of the faults. The large value of the process fault is ignored in here 
since this large value could easily be detected. 
The test data sets involve 10 simulation runs’ data vectors. The inputs to the ANN and SVM were the

5. Conclusion 
The combination of SPC and EPC is a good way to monitor and control a manufacturing process. 
Specifically, the EPC is typically used for controlling the autocorrelated process. However, the compensation 
of the process fault also decreases the SPC monitoring capability. This study is motivated to overcome the 
deficiencies of an SPC/EPC system. This study proposes the SPC/EPC/ANN, SPC/EPC/SVM and the use of 
binomial distribution probability to effectively determine the starting time of a process fault. The effectiveness 
of the proposed approach is reported through the use of a series of simulations. 
By performing the simulations, we observed that proposed SPC/EPC/ANN and SPC/EPC/SVM are able to 
effectively assist in determining the starting time of a fault in an autocorrelated process. The simulation results 
show that the proposed approach has better performance than the use of SPC/EPC alone. As the simulation 
results reveal, the classification capability of the proposed approach can be used to substantially improve 
process control in industries. 
The proposed approach is simple to use and effective in categorizing the starting time of a fault. As a result, 
the proposed fault detection technique should improve personnel effectiveness in determining and correcting 
the root causes of a fault, resulting in enhanced overall process performance. Nevertheless, this study only 
discusses the case of mean shift faults, and it should attempt to categorize the variance shift faults in the 
future.

AN INTEGRATED NEURAL NETWORKS AND SPC APPROACH TO IDENTIFY THE STARTING 
TIME OF A PROCESS DISTURBANCE

ABSTRACT. The typical Shewhart control charts are insensitive in detecting a small process shifts. 
This results in a large value of out-of-control average run length, and consequently, the search of the 
root causes becomes difficult. One possible solution for this problem is to quickly identify the starting 
time of a process disturbance. However, in practice, the decision about the starting time of a process 
disturbance is not easily made. This study is motivated to propose the combination of neural network 
(NN) and SPC charts to solve this difficulty. Using NN and SPC combination scheme, this study 
introduces a useful technique to identify the starting time of a process disturbance based on the 
execution of a binomial random experiment. The effectiveness and the fruitful results of the proposed 
approach are demonstrated through the use of a series of simulations. 
Keywords: SPC charts, Neural networks, Starting time, Binomial 
 
1. Introduction. The SPC charts are proven to be effective in detecting the presence of the disturbances in a 
process. The primary function of SPC charts is that an out-of-control signal will be triggered when the 
assignable causes or the process disturbances are occurred in the process. When a signal is generated, a search 
for the root causes of the process disturbances should have begun. Once the root causes are identified, the 
proper remedial actions would bring the out-of-control process back into a state of in-control. 
In practice, the identification of the root causes of an out-of-control process is not straightforward. 
Typically, process personnel may apply some techniques (for example, the fishbone diagram) to searching the 
root causes of a process disturbance. The effectiveness of these techniques heavily depends on the “starting 
time” of a process disturbance. The starting time of a process disturbance would usually contain the most 
accurate and useful evidences that enable us to easily and correctly determine the root causes of a process 
disturbance. However, the question is “when is the starting time of a process disturbance?” Using the SPC 
charts alone, we are unable to effectively identify the starting time of a process disturbance. Even when the 
signal is generated, what we can make sure is that something went wrong, but we do not know exactly when 
the disturbances have been introduced in the process. As a result, process personnel need more time and cost 
to improve the underlying process. 
Because of the remarkable capability of classification, NN is widely used in industry. The purpose of this 
study is to integrate the SPC charts and NN to identify the starting time of a disturbance. This study considers 
the general types of disturbances, the process mean shifts. In addition, this study employs two typical SPC 
charts to demonstrate the fruitful results of our proposed approach. These two SPC charts include X and 
cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts. This study applies the binomial experiment to the proposed model, 
and this study uses the characteristic of binominal distribution cumulative probability to help process 
personnel quickly determine the starting time of a disturbance. 
The structure of this study is as follows. Section 1 addresses the motivation and the purpose of this study. 
Section 2 discusses the relevant research works. This section also introduces the proposed techniques which

failure of a binomial experiment. Since the decision about the starting time of a disturbance is not 
appropriately made by only one single outcome of the output variable, we may employ the cumulative 
probability distribution of a binomial experiment to determine the starting time. Consider that an SPC signal is 
triggered at time t, we can calculate the cumulative probability beginning at time t to a certain time t-s. The 
cumulative probability should be chosen as a large number (say, larger than or equal to 0.9) so that we may 
have strong confidence to ensure that the process disturbance has been introduced at time t-s.   
Consider a process which is in control from time period 1 to 100, and the process outputs follow a 
normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. After time 101, a disturbance has introduced 
in the process, and the process outputs follow a normal distribution with mean of 0.5 and standard deviation 
of 1. Table 2 displays an example of monitoring results by an X control chart. An out-of-control signal is 
triggered at time 160. The first column of Table 2 is the sampling number which starts from time 1 to the 
signal time t. The second column of Table 2 is the backward number, recording list from the signal time t to 1 
in a backward sequence. The third column of Table 2 stands for the outcomes of the output variable in NN 
model. The value of 1 indicates that the process disturbance has occurred, while the value of 0 implies that the 
disturbance has not appeared yet. The fourth column of Table 2 is the cumulative sum of “1”, start counting 
from the signal time, 160. The last column of Table 2 is the binomial cumulative distribution probability. For 
example, the value of the cumulative probability is 1.0 when the sampling number is 156. This is because that 
the cumulative sum of “1’s” (i.e., column 4) is 5 and the number of experiment (i.e, column 2) is also 5, we 
can calculate the binomial probability by using Eq. (1).

That is, we can compute the 1)5(...)1()0()5( ==++=+==≤ xfxfxfxp . Since the probability is 1, we 
have very strong confidence that the process disturbance should start at time 156 (instead of time 160). Also, 
observing Table 2, we can notice that the cumulative probability is 0.96 at sampling number 147. Since the 
probability of 0.96 is high, we should identify that the process disturbance has occurred at time 147 (instead 
of time 156). One thing we have to address that the cumulative probability should be high in order to have 
strong confidence for determining the starting time of a disturbance. 
 
3. Examples. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed approaches, this study performs a series of 
simulations. This study assumes that an in control process outputs (the first 100 observations) follow a normal 
distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 (i.e., N(0,1)). This study also assumes that if the 
process disturbance has occurred (i.e., after time 101), the process would follow N(u1,1). The u1 is defined as: 
 u1 = u0+ kσ = 0+ kσ = kσ,  (2)
where 
u0: the in control process mean,  
k: the constant and it usually equals to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0, respectively, and 
σ: the process standard deviation. 
 
3.1. The NN design. To use the NN, we need to design the structure of the NN model. In this study, 6 training 
data sets were developed for the disturbance series. All training data sets included 1750 “in-control” (i.e., no 
disturbance involved) data vectors and 1750 “out-of-control” (i.e., a disturbance was introduced into the 
process) data vectors. The 1750 out-of-control data vectors of the first training set were generated with the use 
of k=0.5 for a disturbance. Similarly, the 1750 out-of-control data vectors of the second, third, and fourth, 
fifth, and sixth training sets were generated with the use of k=1.0, k=1.5, k=2.0, k=2.5 and k=3.0, respectively. 
The test data sets involved 750 in-control data vectors and 750 out-of-control data vectors. 
 22
After integration with NN, for the case of P=1.0, P=0.95 and P=0.9, the starting time of a disturbance are 
identified as t=138, t=134, and t=131, respectively. The corresponding process improvements by using the 
proposed NN/CUSUM structures are 3%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. In the case of k=1.0, the proposed 
approach also can achieve 2%, 2%, and 2% process improvements when P=1.0, P=0.95, and P=0.90, 
respectively. Again, in all conditions, the proposed approaches always have earlier identification of the 
starting time than the traditional SPC chart’s method.

4. Conclusions. To determine the starting time of a disturbance is a major issue for process industries. In this 
study, we have discussed how to quickly identify the starting time of a process disturbance. Using the 
binomial distribution theory, we have integrated NN with two SPC charts to propose our identification 
procedures. After generating an out-of-control signal by SPC charts, the proposed NN/SPC are able to 
effectively identify the starting time of a disturbance. 
We would address some research findings in the following. The larger the magnitude of the process 
disturbances, the quicker signal is triggered by SPC charts. As a result, the signal time is closed to the starting 
time of a disturbance. In this situation, we may use SPC charts alone to determine the starting time of a 
disturbance. However, industry has paid more attention in detecting small process shifts. When the magnitude 
of the disturbance is small, the SPC charts alone method should not be used to determine the starting time of a 
disturbance. Instead, the proposed NN/SPC approaches should be employed. We have shown that, in the cases 
of small process mean shifts, the significant process improvement can be achieved by using the proposed 
approach. Even using the CUSUM and EWMA control charts, which have fine reputation in detecting small 
process mean shifts, the process improvement could be attained with the assistance of the proposed NN/SPC 
structures. In fact, no matter what the SPC charts used, the proposed NN/SPC models have always superior 
performance.

ABSTRACT. The statistical process control (SPC) charts have successfully been implemented in 
industries for more than seventy years. It is a must to search for the root causes of a process 
disturbance when an out-of-control signal is triggered by the SPC chart. The correct and quick 
determination of the root causes is able to significantly improve the process. However, it is a time 
consuming task for this determination if we do not know the change point or starting time of a 
disturbance. Consequently, the determination of the change point of a process becomes a very 
important research issue. In contrast to the typical assumption of the normality of a process, this 
study considers a process which is uniformly distributed.  This study combines the maximum 
likelihood estimation (MLE) and the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart to 
estimate the change point of a uniform process. In addition, due to the common seen in chemical 
processes, this study considers the case of the sample size of one. This study derives the exact 
control limits for a uniform process, and this study addresses the fruitful results of the proposed 
approach by performing a series of computer simulations. 
Keywords: Change point, MLE, Disturbance, Uniform distribution 
 
1.  Introduction. Since Shewhart (1931) has initially studied the SPC charts, they have become one of the 
most important techniques for process monitoring. An out-of-control signal which is triggered by an SPC 
chart would indicate that the underlying process is in a state of out-of-control. The process personnel should 
take remedial control action and bring the process back in a state of in control. It is very important to correctly 
identify the root causes of the disturbances in order to certify that the remedial control action is appropriate. In 
practice, the searching or determination of the root causes for a disturbance is not straightforward. One major 
reason is that, for the most of the time, the signal is not triggered immediately when the disturbances have 
been introduced in the first beginning. In particular, the small magnitude of the process shifts always slow the 
signal timing. As a consequence, it becomes difficult to determine the root causes of the disturbance. Process 
industries were then attracted to this important research issue.  
It would be much easy to determine the root causes of the problem if we are able to identify the change 
point of a disturbance. It is reasonable to use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the 
change point if the process distribution is known. Most MLE applications of the change point problem assume 
that the process is normally distributed. Even if the process is not normally distributed, it can be 
approximately a normal distribution as long as the moderate sample sizes are selected with the use of central 
limit theorem. Both of the studies [1-2] applied X and S control charts to monitoring the normal processes, 
respectively. The statistical properties for the MLE estimators were reported [3]. Also, the combination of 
EWMA and Cusum control charts with MLE were investigated to determine the change point of a process [4]. 
The above studies all have the common assumption of the normality of the process. 
However, due to the reasons of sampling cost and the reaction time of chemical products, there are certain 
applications in which it is not feasible to have moderate sample sizes. These applications are commonly seen 
in chemical processes where the sample size is one. Thus, the quality characteristic of a process may not 
follow a normal distribution in practice. In contrast to the typical assumption of the normality of a process,

3. Simulation Studies. A series of simulations were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach 
introduced in section 2. When a signal was triggered by the EWMA chart, the estimator introduced in section 
2 was then applied to the data to estimate the time of the change. Sample observations were generated 
randomly from a uniform distribution. The simulation assumed that a uniform process is in control for the first 
100 observations, and a disturbance has been introduced at time period of 101. The following simulation 
scenario was considered:

where  0u  and 1u  stand for the in control and out of control process mean, respectively, k is a certain 
constant. Nine values of k were considered, and they include 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0,

4. Conclusion. To effectively estimate the change point of a process would significantly improve the 
underlying process. The case of sample size of one is widely seen in chemical applications. As a result, the 
typical assumption of normality may not be applicable. This study is thus motivated to investigate the case of 
uniformly distributed applications. 
In order to fruitfully determine the change point of a uniform process, this study proposes an estimating 
approach that combines the MLE method with the EWMA control chart. The proposed estimators are derived, 
and the effective performance is reported through a series of simulations. The research findings strongly 
support our proposed approach.

Abstract. The multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) chart plays an important role in 
monitoring a multivariate process. Once a process disturbance has occurred, the MSPC 
out-of-control signal would be triggered. The process personnel then begin to search for the root 
causes of a disturbance in order to take remedial action to compensate for the effects of the 
disturbance. However, the use of MSPC chart encounters a difficulty in practice. This difficult 
issue involves which quality variable or which set of the quality variables is responsible for the 
generation of the out-of-control signal. This determination is not straightforward, and it usually 
confused the process personnel. This study proposes a hybrid approach which is composed of 
independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector machine (SVM) to determine the fault 
quality variables when a step-change disturbance existed in a process. The well-known Hotelling 
T2 control chart is employed to monitor the multivariate process. The proposed hybrid ICA-SVM 
scheme first uses ICA to the Hotelling T2 statistics generating independent components (ICs). The 
hidden useful information of the fault quality variables could be discovered in these ICs. The ICs 
are then used as the input variables of the SVM for building the classification model. The 
performance of various process designs is investigated and compared with the typical 
classification method.

1   Introduction 
Multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) chart is one of the most important techniques to monitor a 
multivariate process. The generation of the out-of-control signal indicates that the disturbance has been 
introduced in the underlying process. When the MSPC chart triggers a signal, the process personnel should 
remove the root causes of the disturbance and then bring the process back in a state of statistical control. The 
remove of the disturbance would mainly depend on the correct determination of the fault quality variables. 
Once the correct determination has been made, the corresponding remedial actions can be properly taken to 
compensate for the effects of the disturbance. As a consequence, the process improvement can be significantly 
achieved. 
However, the use of MSPC chart often encounters a problem in which the interpretation of the signal is 
confusing. Although the generation of signal implies that the underlying process is out-of-control, the 
contributors of the fault quality variables to this signal are difficult to determine. Typically, there are 2p-1 
 32
where ia  is the 
thi  column of the mm×  unknown mixing matrix A ; is  is the thi  row of the nm×  
source matrix S . The vectors is  are latent source signals that cannot be directly observed from the observed 
mixture signals iΧ . The ICA model aims at finding an mm×  de-mixing matrix W  such that  
 
][][ XwWXyY ii === ,                      (2) 
 
where iy  is the 
thi  row of the matrix Y , mi  , ,2 ,1 L= . The vectors iy  must be as statistically 
independent as possible, and are called independent components (ICs). ICs are used to estimate the latent 
source signals is . The vector iw  in equation (2) is the 
thi  row of the de-mixing matrix W , mi  , ,2 ,1 L= . It 
is used to filter the observed signals X  to generate the corresponding independent component iy , i.e., 
Xwy ii = , mi  , ,2 ,1 L= . 
The ICA modeling is formulated as an optimization problem by setting up the measure of the 
independence of ICs as an objective function and using some optimization techniques for solving the 
de-mixing matrix W  [23-24] The ICs with non-Gaussian distributions imply the statistical independence [23], 
and the non-Gaussianity of the ICs can be measured by the negentropy [25]:  
 
)()()( yyy HHJ gauss −= ,                     (3) 
 
where gaussy  is a Gaussian random vector having the same covariance matrix as y . H is the entropy of a 
random vector y  with density )(yp  defined as ∫−= yyyy dppH )(log)()( . 
The negentropy is always non-negative and is zero if and only if y  has a Gaussian distribution. Since the 
problem in using negentropy is computationally very difficult, an approximation of negentropy is proposed 
[25] as follows:  
 
2)}]({)}({[)( vGEyGEyJ −≈                     (4) 
 
where v  is a Gaussian variable of zero mean and unit variance, and y  is a random variable with zero mean 
and unit variance. G  is a nonquadratic function, and is given by )log(cosh)( yyG =  in this study. The 
FastICA algorithm proposed by [23] is adopted in this paper to solve for the de-mixing matrix W . Two 
preprocessing steps are common in the ICA modeling, centering and whitening [23]. Firstly, the input matrix 
X  is centered by subtracting the row means of the input matrix, i.e., ))(( iii E xxx −← . The matrix X  with 
zero mean is then passed through the whitening matrix V  to remove the second order statistic of the input 
matrix, i.e., VXZ = . The whitening matrix V  is twice the inverse square root of the covariance matrix of 
the input matrix, i.e., )2/1())(2 −= XV C , where )( TEC xxX =  is the covariance matrix of X . The rows of the 
whitened input matrix Z , denoted by z , are uncorrelated and have unit variance, i.e., Izz =)( TE . In this 
study, it is assumed that the training and testing process datasets are centered and whitened.  
2.2   Support Vector Machine 
The use of SVM algorithm can be described as follows. Let ( ){ }Niii y 1, =x , di R∈x , { }1 ,1−∈iy  be the training set 
with input vectors and labels. Here, N is the number of sample observations and d is the dimension of each 
observation, iy  is known target. The algorithm is to seek the hyperplane 0=+⋅ bixw , where w is the vector 
of hyperplane and b is a bias term, to separate the data from two classes with maximal margin width 2/2 w , 
and the all points under the boundary is named support vector. In order to obtain the optimal hyperplane, the 
 34
process follows a normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The out-of-control process 
has a mean shift of 1 standard deivation, that is, the out-of-coantrol process follows a normal distribution with 
mean of 1 and standard deivation of 1. This study also considers a common used sample size of 5, and the 
sample averages (
iX , i = 1, 2, and 3) are used to calculate the Hotelling T
2 statistics. The Hotelling T2 
statistics are computed as follows. 
 
 )()( 1'2 XXSXXnT −−= − , (7)
 
where 
n: the sample size, 
X :  the mean vector at the time t, 
X : the grand mean vector of the quality characteristics, and 
S-1: the inverse of variance and covariance matrix. 
 
Also, this sttudy generates 100 data sets of observations (each of sample size 5) for every possible sets. 
Since there are 7 possible sets of fault quality variables in the case of P=3, we have 700 data sets in a 
simulation run. Those 700 data sets are initially used to be the training data. This study generate another 700 
data sets for the purpose of the testing. Figure 1 displays the 700 data sets of 1X , 2X , and 3X in the cases of 
0=ρ , 6.0=ρ , and 9.0=ρ , respectively. In the first step of classification, we also use the data set of 
out-of-control Hotelling T2 statistics which is shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 displays the two ICs which is 
generated by using ICA technique.  
3.3   The Results 
In the case of P=3 in a multivariate process, the typical approach uses four variables, 1X , 2X , 3X , and the 
Hotelling T2 statistics as inputs for SVM. When the proposed approach is employed, the five variables, 1X , 
2X , 3X , and the two ICs, are considered as the inputs for SVM. Table 1 shows the experimental results of the 
testing phase for the typical and the proposed appraoches. Considering the case of ρ =0 and the shift type of 
(1,0,0), the typical approach (i.e., T2+SVM) shows that the CIR is 73.5% and the CIR is 81.1% for the 
proposed approach. We can apparently notice that the proposed approach outperforms the typical approach. In 
the case of ρ =0.9 and the shift type of (1,0,0), the proposed approach is significantly superior than the typical 
approach. Observing Table 1, we can conclude that the proposed approach is better than the typical approach 
in most cases. 
Table 2 demonstrates the experimental results of the testing phase in the case of P=2, P=3, and P=5, 
respectively. Considering the case of P=5 and ρ =0.9, the typical approach shows that the averaged CIR is 
41.05% while the proposed approach is 87.34%. The number in parentheses stands for the standard error of 
the averaged CIR. The smaller standard error indicates that the identification mechanism is more consistent. 
Again, comparing the two standard errors of 7.23 and 6.93, we can conclude that the proposed approach is 
much better. 
4   Conclusion 
Determination of the fault quality variables for an out-of-control multivariate process is very important in 
practice. While most of the studies use the single step of classification, this study proposes the two-step 
approach, ICA-SVM, to overcome the difficulties. The proposed ICA-SVM scheme is able to enhance the 
correct identification rate for the determination of fault quality variables. 
The proposed scheme initially uses ICA to the Hotelling T2 statistics to generate two ICs. As a 
consequence, the SVM model uses the two ICs as inputs for the proposed classification. In this study, three 
types of quality variables and correlations are considered for evaluating the performance of the proposed 
approach. Experimental results strongly agreed that the proposed ICA-SVM scheme is able to produce the

SPC charts include X and cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts. This study applies the binomial 
experiment to the proposed model, and this study uses the characteristic of binominal distribution 
cumulative probability to help process personnel quickly determine the starting time of a disturbance. 
The structure of this study is as follows. Section 1 addresses the motivation and the purpose of this 
study. Section 2 discusses the relevant research works. This section also introduces the proposed 
techniques which are used to integrate SPC charts and NN. Section 3 performs a series of simulations. 
The results of traditional approach and the proposed approach are analyzed and compared. The last 
section gives the conclusion and provides future research direction. 
 
2. Proposed approaches. Because of the quicker determination of the root causes for an out-of-control 
process, the identification of the starting time of a process disturbance becomes an important issue for 
industries. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was used to estimate the starting time of a 
process disturbance under the assumption of a normal process [1,2]. The statistical properties for the 
MLE estimators of the starting time were provided [3]. In addition, the combination of EWMA and 
CUSUM control charts with MLE was investigated to identify the starting time of a process disturbance 
[4]. However, most of those studies have the common assumption in which the underlying process is a 
known distribution. The MLE estimators are unable to derive when the process distribution is unknown. 
Also, the MLE estimators may be very difficult to derive even when the process distribution is known. 
For example, it is troublesome to obtain the MLE estimator when the underling process follows a 
student t distribution. Moreover, some research also concerned with the starting time of a process 
disturbance [5-7]. 
In recent years, many researchers have focused on process monitoring improvement by combining 
NN and SPC [8-12]. However, little work has been done on identifying the starting time of a process 
disturbance with the use of NN and SPC. Consequently, this study is motivated to propose a solution to 
solve this difficulty. Different from the typical assumption that the process distribution is known, this 
study considers the case where the process could be distribution free. In addition, since a step change 
disturbance is the most commonly found in industries, this study considers it as the process disturbance 
[13-14]. 
 
2.1. The NN models. Using the integration of SPC charts and NN, we are able to enhance the 
monitoring ability of the SPC charts and quickly identify the starting time of a process disturbance. 
Two types of neural networks, the feedforward and the feedback networks, are usually employed. The 
neural network’s nodes are usually consisted into three layers: the input layer, the output layer, and the 
hidden layer. The nodes in the input layer receive input signals from an external source and the nodes in 
the output layer provide the target output signals. In addition, the more hidden layers, the more 
complicated the structure of the NN. In this study, we use a single hidden layer. The number of 
operands of the hidden layer could be determined by the number of the input variables, i. In general, the 
number of operands may be equal to 2i, 2i ± 1, or 2i ± 2. For example, the number of operands in the 
hidden layer could be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 if there are two input variables in the neural network. In this study, 
the input and output variables for the various NN/SPC structures are displayed in Table 1.

Output o: 
o = 0: in control; 
o = 1: out-of-control 
 
2.2 The identification procedure. Suppose a process is monitored by an SPC chart, and a signal is 
triggered at time t. Then we can be sure that the starting time of a disturbance is occurred at time t at 
the latest. We do, however, doubt whether the starting time may be occurred before time t. That is, the 
8 
 
that if the process disturbance has occurred (i.e., after time 101), the process would follow N(u1,1). The 
u1 is defined as: 
 u1 = u0+ kσ = 0+ kσ = kσ,  (2)
where 
u0: the in control process mean,  
k: the constant and it usually equals to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0, respectively, and 
σ: the process standard deviation. 
 
3.1. The NN design. To use the NN, we need to design the structure of the NN model. In this study, 6 
training data sets were developed for the disturbance series. All training data sets included 1750 
“in-control” (i.e., no disturbance involved) data vectors and 1750 “out-of-control” (i.e., a disturbance 
was introduced into the process) data vectors. The 1750 out-of-control data vectors of the first training 
set were generated with the use of k=0.5 for a disturbance. Similarly, the 1750 out-of-control data 
vectors of the second, third, and fourth, fifth, and sixth training sets were generated with the use of 
k=1.0, k=1.5, k=2.0, k=2.5 and k=3.0, respectively. The test data sets involved 750 in-control data 
vectors and 750 out-of-control data vectors. 
Again, the inputs to the network were reported in Table 1. The network output consisted of one 
node. There is no strict method to determine the number of hidden nodes in a NN model. As a 
consequence, experimentation and rules of thumb were used to arrive at the numbers used. Too few 
hidden nodes limit a network generalization capability, while too many hidden nodes can result in 
over-training or memorization by the network. Since there are only one or a few input nodes and one 
output node used in this study, the number of hidden nodes to test were chosen as 2n, 2n ± 1, or 2n ± 2., 
where n stands for the number of inputs. 
 
3.2. Results and discussions. In this study, we report the starting time of a disturbance using three 
different cumulative probability (P), including P=0.90, P=0.95, and P=1.0, respectively. In addition, 
since there are two NN/SPC structures employ in this study, we consider the following two cases. 
Case 1 (NN/X): The simulation results for integrating NN with X control chart (NN/X) are 
displayed in Table 3. Observing Table 3, we notice that the starting time is t=247 in the case of k=0.5 
and the use of X chart alone. After integration with NN, for the case of P=1.0, P=0.95 and P=0.9, the 
starting time of a disturbance are identified as t=245, t=214, and t=198, respectively. In addition, the 
corresponding process improvements by using the proposed NN models are 1%, 13%, and 20%, 
respectively. In the case of k=1.0, the proposed approach still can achieve 2%, 8%, and 15% process 
improvements when P=1.0, P=0.95, and P=0.90, respectively. In all conditions, the proposed 
approaches always have earlier identification of the starting time than the method of X control chart 
alone.

Using the binomial distribution theory, we have integrated NN with two SPC charts to propose our 
identification procedures. After generating an out-of-control signal by SPC charts, the proposed 
NN/SPC are able to effectively identify the starting time of a disturbance. 
We would address some research findings in the following. The larger the magnitude of the 
process disturbances, the quicker signal is triggered by SPC charts. As a result, the signal time is closed 
to the starting time of a disturbance. In this situation, we may use SPC charts alone to determine the 
starting time of a disturbance. However, industry has paid more attention in detecting small process 
shifts. When the magnitude of the disturbance is small, the SPC charts alone method should not be used 
to determine the starting time of a disturbance. Instead, the proposed NN/SPC approaches should be 
employed. We have shown that, in the cases of small process mean shifts, the significant process 
improvement can be achieved by using the proposed approach. Even using the CUSUM and EWMA 
control charts, which have fine reputation in detecting small process mean shifts, the process 
improvement could be attained with the assistance of the proposed NN/SPC structures. In fact, no 
matter what the SPC charts used, the proposed NN/SPC models have always superior performance.

ABSTRACT. The statistical process control (SPC) charts have successfully been 
implemented in industries for more than seventy years. It is a must to search for the root 
causes of a process disturbance when an out-of-control signal is triggered by the SPC chart. 
The correct and quick determination of the root causes is able to significantly improve the 
process. However, it is a time consuming task for this determination if we do not know the 
change point or starting time of a disturbance. Consequently, the determination of the 
change point of a process becomes a very important research issue. In contrast to the 
typical assumption of the normality of a process, this study considers a process which is 
uniformly distributed.  This study combines the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and 
the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart to estimate the change point of a 
uniform process. In addition, due to the common seen in chemical processes, this study 
considers the case of the sample size of one. This study derives the exact control limits for a 
uniform process, and this study addresses the fruitful results of the proposed approach by 
performing a series of computer simulations. 
Keywords: Change point, MLE, Disturbance, Uniform distribution 
 
1.  Introduction. Since Shewhart (1931) has initially studied the SPC charts, they have become one of 
the most important techniques for process monitoring. An out-of-control signal which is triggered by an 
SPC chart would indicate that the underlying process is in a state of out-of-control. The process 
personnel should take remedial control action and bring the process back in a state of in control. It is 
very important to correctly identify the root causes of the disturbances in order to certify that the 
remedial control action is appropriate. In practice, the searching or determination of the root causes for 
a disturbance is not straightforward. One major reason is that, for the most of the time, the signal is not 
triggered immediately when the disturbances have been introduced in the first beginning. In particular, 
the small magnitude of the process shifts always slow the signal timing. As a consequence, it becomes 
difficult to determine the root causes of the disturbance. Process industries were then attracted to this 
important research issue.  
It would be much easy to determine the root causes of the problem if we are able to identify the 
change point of a disturbance. It is reasonable to use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to 
estimate the change point if the process distribution is known. Most MLE applications of the change 
point problem assume that the process is normally distributed. Even if the process is not normally 
distributed, it can be approximately a normal distribution as long as the moderate sample sizes are 
selected with the use of central limit theorem. Both of the studies [1-2] applied X and S control charts 
to monitoring the normal processes, respectively. The statistical properties for the MLE estimators were 
reported [3]. Also, the combination of EWMA and Cusum control charts with MLE were investigated 
to determine the change point of a process [4]. The above studies all have the common assumption of

3. Simulation Studies. A series of simulations were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
approach introduced in section 2. When a signal was triggered by the EWMA chart, the estimator 
introduced in section 2 was then applied to the data to estimate the time of the change. Sample 
observations were generated randomly from a uniform distribution. The simulation assumed that a 
uniform process is in control for the first 100 observations, and a disturbance has been introduced at 
time period of 101. The following simulation scenario was considered:

4. Conclusion. To effectively estimate the change point of a process would significantly improve the 
underlying process. The case of sample size of one is widely seen in chemical applications. As a result, 
the typical assumption of normality may not be applicable. This study is thus motivated to investigate 
the case of uniformly distributed applications. 
In order to fruitfully determine the change point of a uniform process, this study proposes an 
estimating approach that combines the MLE method with the EWMA control chart. The proposed 
estimators are derived, and the effective performance is reported through a series of simulations. The 
research findings strongly support our proposed approach.

Abstract. The multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) chart plays an important role 
in monitoring a multivariate process. Once a process disturbance has occurred, the MSPC 
out-of-control signal would be triggered. The process personnel then begin to search for the 
root causes of a disturbance in order to take remedial action to compensate for the effects of 
the disturbance. However, the use of MSPC chart encounters a difficulty in practice. This 
difficult issue involves which quality variable or which set of the quality variables is 
responsible for the generation of the out-of-control signal. This determination is not 
straightforward, and it usually confused the process personnel. This study proposes a hybrid 
approach which is composed of independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector 
machine (SVM) to determine the fault quality variables when a step-change disturbance 
existed in a process. The well-known Hotelling T2 control chart is employed to monitor the 
multivariate process. The proposed hybrid ICA-SVM scheme first uses ICA to the 
Hotelling T2 statistics generating independent components (ICs). The hidden useful 
information of the fault quality variables could be discovered in these ICs. The ICs are then 
used as the input variables of the SVM for building the classification model. The 
performance of various process designs is investigated and compared with the typical 
classification method.

1   Introduction 
Multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) chart is one of the most important techniques to 
monitor a multivariate process. The generation of the out-of-control signal indicates that the 
disturbance has been introduced in the underlying process. When the MSPC chart triggers a signal, the 
process personnel should remove the root causes of the disturbance and then bring the process back in a 
state of statistical control. The remove of the disturbance would mainly depend on the correct 
determination of the fault quality variables. Once the correct determination has been made, the

Let Tm ] , , ,[ 21 ΧΧΧX L=  be an matrix of size nm× , nm ≤ , consisting of observed mixture signals

where ia  is the 
thi  column of the mm×  unknown mixing matrix A ; is  is the thi  row of the 
nm×  source matrix S . The vectors is  are latent source signals that cannot be directly observed from 
the observed mixture signals iΧ . The ICA model aims at finding an mm×  de-mixing matrix W  
such that

where iy  is the 
thi  row of the matrix Y , mi  , ,2 ,1 L= . The vectors iy  must be as statistically 
independent as possible, and are called independent components (ICs). ICs are used to estimate the 
latent source signals is . The vector iw  in equation (2) is the 
thi  row of the de-mixing matrix W , 
mi  , ,2 ,1 L= . It is used to filter the observed signals X  to generate the corresponding independent 
component iy , i.e., Xwy ii = , mi  , ,2 ,1 L= . 
The ICA modeling is formulated as an optimization problem by setting up the measure of the 
independence of ICs as an objective function and using some optimization techniques for solving the 
de-mixing matrix W  [23-24] The ICs with non-Gaussian distributions imply the statistical 
independence [23], and the non-Gaussianity of the ICs can be measured by the negentropy [25]:

where gaussy  is a Gaussian random vector having the same covariance matrix as y . H is the entropy 
of a random vector y  with density )(yp  defined as ∫−= yyyy dppH )(log)()( . 
The negentropy is always non-negative and is zero if and only if y  has a Gaussian distribution. 
Since the problem in using negentropy is computationally very difficult, an approximation of 
negentropy is proposed [25] as follows:

where v  is a Gaussian variable of zero mean and unit variance, and y  is a random variable with zero 
mean and unit variance. G  is a nonquadratic function, and is given by )log(cosh)( yyG =  in this 
study. The FastICA algorithm proposed by [23] is adopted in this paper to solve for the de-mixing 
matrix W . Two preprocessing steps are common in the ICA modeling, centering and whitening [23]. 
Firstly, the input matrix X  is centered by subtracting the row means of the input matrix, i.e., 
))(( iii E xxx −← . The matrix X  with zero mean is then passed through the whitening matrix V  to

The proposed model first collect two sets of Hotelling T2 statistics from the out-of-control process. 
The ICA model is used to generate the two estimated ICs from the observed Hotelling T2 statistics. 
Then, the proposed scheme considers those two ICs and 3 averaged quality variables, 4 averaged 
quality variables, and 5 averaged quality variables as inputs for SVM in the case of processes with 3 
quality characteristics, 4 quality characteristics, and 5 quality characteristics, respectively. 
3.2   The Simulated Example 
In order to demonstrate the use of our proposed approach, this study considers a simulated example. 
This study applies Hotelling T2 control chart to monitoring a multivariate process with 3, 4, and 5 
quality characteristics, respectively. For each type of processes, this study considers the types of 
correlation, ρ , between any two qualtiy variables as no correlation (i.e., 0=ρ ), moderate correlation 
(i.e., 6.0=ρ ), and high correlation (i.e., 9.0=ρ ). Now, consider a case of out-of-control process with 3 
quality characteristics. Since the process has 3 quality characteristics (i.e., P=3), the possible sets of 
fault quality variables would be 2p-1=7. In our study, we use the following notations: (1,0,0), (0,1,0), 
(0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), and (1,1,1) to represent the 7 possible sets, in which “0” stands for the 
“in-control” state and “1” stands for the “out-of-control” state. The meaning of (1,1,0) stands for the 
first and second quality variables (i.e., 1X and 2X ) are fault while the third quality variable (i.e., 3X ) is 
not fault. In our simulation, we assume that the in control process follows a normal distribution with 
mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The out-of-control process has a mean shift of 1 standard 
deivation, that is, the out-of-coantrol process follows a normal distribution with mean of 1 and standard 
deivation of 1. This study also considers a common used sample size of 5, and the sample averages (
iX , 
i = 1, 2, and 3) are used to calculate the Hotelling T2 statistics. The Hotelling T2 statistics are computed 
as follows. 
 
 )()( 1'2 XXSXXnT −−= − , (7)
 
where 
n: the sample size, 
X :  the mean vector at the time t, 
X : the grand mean vector of the quality characteristics, and 
S-1: the inverse of variance and covariance matrix. 
 
Also, this sttudy generates 100 data sets of observations (each of sample size 5) for every possible 
sets. Since there are 7 possible sets of fault quality variables in the case of P=3, we have 700 data sets 
in a simulation run. Those 700 data sets are initially used to be the training data. This study generate 
another 700 data sets for the purpose of the testing. Figure 1 displays the 700 data sets of 1X , 2X , and 
3X in the cases of 0=ρ , 6.0=ρ , and 9.0=ρ , respectively. In the first step of classification, we also use 
the data set of out-of-control Hotelling T2 statistics which is shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 displays the 
two ICs which is generated by using ICA technique.  
3.3   The Results 
In the case of P=3 in a multivariate process, the typical approach uses four variables, 1X , 2X , 3X , and 
the Hotelling T2 statistics as inputs for SVM. When the proposed approach is employed, the five 
variables, 1X , 2X , 3X , and the two ICs, are considered as the inputs for SVM. Table 1 shows the 
experimental results of the testing phase for the typical and the proposed appraoches. Considering the 
case of ρ =0 and the shift type of (1,0,0), the typical approach (i.e., T2+SVM) shows that the CIR is
