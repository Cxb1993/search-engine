英文摘要: In this report, we study the effect of finite-power, phase-locked loop (PLL) based 
phase noise on the bit-error-rate (BER) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) 
systems in frequency-selective fading channels. It is well known the impact of phase noise on the 
performance of an OFDM system can be divided into a multiplicative term called common phase 
error (CPE) and an additive term called intercarrier interference (ICI). Based on the conditional 
Gaussian approximation technique, we first derive the BER formulas for BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 
and 64-QAM modulated OFDM signals in frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. To 
further quantify the individual influence of the CPE and the ICI on system performance for 
different phase noise spectra, we derive the BER expressions for perfect CPE compensation cases. 
The analytical results obtained for frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels are then 
generalized to frequency-selective Rician fading channels. Simulation results not only validate 
the accuracy of our analysis but also show the dependency of BERs on the shapes of phase noise 
spectra. 
Keywords: orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, additive white Gaussian noise channel,

evaluated in [9][10] and [11][12], respectively. Although SNR is a simple way to assess the
impact of phase noise on OFDM systems, BER is a more important and relevant performance
metric. Based on the moment generating function (MGF) technique and the Gaussian
approximation of ICI, the BER analysis of OFDM systems impaired by Wiener phase noise
in AWGN channels was presented in [13]. For the case of finite-power phase noises, the BER
results can be found in [14][15]. However, it has been indicated in [16] and later analyzed
in [17], the Gaussian approximation of ICI is accurate only when the phase noise has larger
bandwidth than the OFDM subcarrier spacing frequency (i.e. fast phase noise) and the
number of subcarriers is large. Besides the CPE correction based on the pilot signals, some
ICI suppression and cancellation schemes have been proposed recently [19]-[21]. At the
expense of higher computational complexity or reduced transmission data rate, these ICI
mitigation schemes can achieve much better performance than the CPE correction method
in the regions of high SNR and large phase noise variance.
Since OFDM systems are usually designed to counter the detrimental effects of frequency-
selective fading channels, it is important to analytically quantify the BER performance in
the presence of both finite-power phase noise and frequency-selective fading. This aspect
has not been considered in the aforementioned works. We apply the BER analysis technique
developed in [22] to the phase noise problem and derive the BER formulas for various mod-
ulations with and without perfect CPE compensation in multipath fading channels. Since
the channel frequency responses and the phase noise frequency responses of different sub-
carriers are correlated, the signal term and the ICI term of the data symbol transmitted
at each subcarrier are correlated. Instead of directly invoking the central limit theorem
(CLT) [23] to approximate the ICI as a Gaussian random variable, we first condition the
received signal on the channel realization and CPE. Then we approximate the ICI plus noise
term as a Gaussian random variable and derive the conditional BER expressions. Finally,
the conditional BER formulas are averaged over the conditional random variables to obtain
the average BERs. Numerical results show that the conditional Gaussian approximation
technique yields accurate BER predictions for various modulations and phase noise spectra.
The remainder of this report is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the
mathematical models of OFDM systems, frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels, and
phase noises. Section III presents the detailed BER analysis for BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM,
and 64-QAM modulated OFDM signals impaired by phase noises. The BER analysis given

consider the CPE is perfectly compensated with the aid of continual pilot signals. In that
case, the performance degradation due to phase noise is purely from the ICI.
To derive the BER formula, without loss of generality, we consider subcarrier 0 as the
desired subcarrier and the received OFDM signal in (6) can be rewritten as
Y0 = H0X0 + jH0X0Ψ0 + V0, (11)
where V0 = j
∑N−1
k=1 HkXkΨk +W0 is the sum of ICI and AWGN. Since V0 is the sum of
N uncorrelated random variables jHkXkΨk and W0, one may try to invoke the CLT to
approximate V0 as a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and suitable variance when
N is large. However, for the AWGN channel, it has been shown in [17] that approximating
the ICI term V0 as a Gaussian random variable is not valid and the ICI term has a thicker
tail. When the frequency-selective fading is present, directly applying the CLT to V0 may
overestimate the BER since the channel response H0 of the signal is correlated with the
channel responses H1, H2, · · · , HN−1 of the interference term V0. That means the signal
power and the interference power are correlated. Moreover, we note that the phase noise
response Ψ0 is also correlated with Ψ1,Ψ2, · · · ,ΨN−1.
To compute the BER accurately, we consider to apply the performance analysis method
developed in [22] to our problems. First, we define the conditional random variables ξk =
Hk|H0 and ζk = Ψk|Ψ0 where k = 1, 2, · · · , N − 1. Since H0 and Hk are jointly complex
Gaussian, the conditional random variable ξk is also a complex Gaussian random variable
[23] with mean and variance as
E[ξk] = H0

Similarly, since Ψk and Ψ0 are jointly complex Gaussian, the conditional random variable
ζk is a complex Gaussian random variable with mean and variance as

and the phase noise spectrum. In most cases, one of the coefficients is dominant over the
others and the ICI power can be well approximated. This approximation provides us more
insights to understand the effect of phase noise on OFDM system performance. We will
use concrete examples to illustrate this point later. Next, we will derive the BER formulas
for various modulation formats under the assumption that perfect channel state information
(CSI) is available at the receiver.
A. BPSK
For BPSK modulation, the constellation X is {−√Es,
√
Es}. Conditioned on H0 and
Ψ0, the conditional BER is given by
Pb(e|H0,Ψ0) = Pr
(
Re[Z0H

)
, (23)
where Q(x) = 1√
2pi
∫∞
x
e−t
2/2dt. From (23), we know the CPE term jH0X0Ψ0 does not affect
the BER performance of BPSK modulation. Since H0 ∼ CN (0, 1), the probability density
function (pdf) of |H0|2 is
f|H0|2(x) =
{
e−x, x ≥ 0
0, otherwise
. (24)
Moreover, the random variable Ψ0 =
1
N
∑N−1
i=0 ψi is the sum of N zero mean Gaussian
random variables. Therefore, Ψ0 is also a zero mean Gaussian random variable with variance
σ2Ψ0 = ρˆ00, which has been given explicitly in (15). The pdf of Ψ0 is given by
fΨ0(y) =
1√
2piσ2Ψ0
e−y
2/2σ2Ψ0 , −∞ < y <∞. (25)
Averaging the conditional BER (23) over the pdfs of |H0|2 and Ψ0, the unconditional
BER can be expressed as

shown in Fig. 2(a). Due to the symmetry of I and Q components, the BERs of the inphase
bits and the quadrature bits are the same. For the purpose of BER analysis, we only need
to compute the BER of the I bits.
Define X1 = {x ∈ X : Re[x] = d} and X2 = {x ∈ X : Re[x] = 3d}. Since the decision
boundary for the MSB of I bits is the imaginary axis, the BER of the MSB of I bits condi-
tioned on H0 and Ψ0 is
PMSBb (e|H0,Ψ0) =

On the other hand, the decision boundaries for the LSB are I = −2d and I = 2d on the I-Q
plane. Therefore, the BER of the LSB of the I bits conditioned on H0 and Ψ0 is
P LSBb (e|H0,Ψ0) =

Finally, the decision boundaries for the LSB bit are I = −6d, I = −2d, I = 2d, and
I = 6d on the I-Q plane. The BER of the LSB bit of I components conditioned on H0 and
Ψ0 is

where
g˜(d,X0, H0,Ψ0) = [g(−6d,X0, H0,Ψ0)− g(−2d,X0, H0,Ψ0)
+ g(2d,X0, H0,Ψ0)− g(6d,X0, H0,Ψ0)] . (36)
The conditional average BER of 64-QAM with phase noise is
P 64QAMb (e|H0,Ψ0) =
1
3
[
PMSBb (e|H0,Ψ0) + PMIDb (e|H0,Ψ0) + P LSBb (e|H0,Ψ0)

, (37)
which can be averaged over the pdfs f|H0|2(x) and fΨ0(y) to obtain the unconditional average
BER P 64QAMb (e).

Finally, the conditional BER formulas are averages over the pdfs f|H0|2(x) and fΨ0(y) to
obtain the average BERs P̂QPSKb (e), P̂

B. Rician Fading Channel
To extend the previous results to Rician fading channels, we begin with the impulse
response of the multipath Rician fading channel
h(t) =
L−1∑
l=0
hl δ(t− lT/N), (44)
where we assume h0 ∼ CN (µ, σ20) is the line-of-sight path and hi ∼ CN (0, σ2i ) are the
scattered paths for i = 1, 2, · · · , L− 1. The channel frequency response of subcarrier i is
Hi =
L−1∑
l=0
hle
−j2piil/N ∼ CN
(
µ,
L−1∑
l=0
σ2l
)
, i = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1. (45)
We normalize the second moment of Hi to be 1 (i.e., |µ|2 +
∑L−1
l=0 σ
2
l = 1) and we define the
Rician factor K = |µ|2/∑L−1l=0 σ2l .
For Rician fading channels, the mean and variance of the conditional random variable
ξk
∆
= Hk|H0 are
E[ξk] = µ+ ρ−100 ρk0(H0 − µ), Var[ξk] = ρkk − ρ−100 |ρk0|2, (46)
where
ρik = E[(Hi − E[Hi])(Hk − E[Hk])∗] =
L−1∑
l=0
σ2l e
j2pi(k−i)l/N . (47)
14
mathematical models of the phase noise spectra, we set a = 6.5, b = 4, c = 10.5, f1 = 1 kHz,
and f2 = 10 kHz for phase noise spectrum A. The parameters β and P in the phase noise
spectrum B are set to 10 kHz and 0.001, respectively [16]. To study the effect of different
phase noise powers σ2ψ on the BER performance, we simply scale the two phase noise spectra
by multiplying suitable constants.
For each of the phase noise spectra considered in this paper, the ratio of the phase noise 3-
dB bandwidth to the subcarrier frequency spacing is much smaller than 1. This corresponds
to the practical case of slow phase noise and the BER computed based on the conventional
Gaussian approximation is very inaccurate [17]. In next subsection, we will demonstrate the
BER can be accurately calculated by using the conditional Gaussian approximation method.
Since the effects of phase noise on system performance are more noticeable for high-order
modulation formats, we will focus our numerical results on 16-QAM and 64-QAM.
B. Results
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the effect of phase noise on the BER performance of 16-QAM
modulated OFDM signals in multipath Rayleigh fading channels with phase noise spectrum
A and B, respectively. The horizontal axis represents the modulated data symbol average
SNR Es/N0 and the vertical axis represents the BER. The dashed lines are obtained from
exact computer simulation without any approximation. On the other hand, the solid lines
are obtained from computer simulation with approximation ejψi ≈ 1 + jψi when |ψi| << 1.
The markers are computed from our theoretical analysis. From Figs. 3 and 4, we can
see the theoretical results and the simulation results with approximation are matched very
well. However, the exact BER is slightly higher than the approximate BER when the phase
noise power σ2ψ is as large as 0.01, especially for phase noise spectrum B. Since we use
the approximation ejψi ≈ 1 + jψi to simplify our analysis, it is worth mentioning that our
analysis is accurate only when |ψi| is far less than 1. Fortunately, this condition holds in
most practical OFDM systems.
By comparing Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we learn the BER performance of phase noise spectrum
A is much worse than that of phase noise spectrum B when they both have the same phase
noise power σ2ψ. Since the CPE term Ψ0 =
1
N
∑N−1
i=0 ψi is a zero mean Gaussian random
variable, we know the variance of Ψ0 depends not only on the variance of ψi but also on
the correlation between any two different phase noise samples. Different phase noise spectra
16
0.1. However, without CPE compensation, Fig. 4 shows the SNR loss at BER 10−3 is about
2 dB even when σ2ψ is equal to 0.01, which is much smaller than 0.1.
Finally, the effects of phase noise spectra A and B on 16-QAM modulated OFDM siganls
in frequency-selective Rician fading channels are shown in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. The
Rician factor K is equal to 10. Again, the theoretical results coincide with the simulation
results very well. Compared to the results obtained for multipath Rayleigh fading channels,
it is interesting to note that the performance difference between phase noise spectrum A and
B is much smaller in Rician fading channels.
VI. Conclusions
This report studied the effect of phase noise on the BER performance of OFDM systems
in frequency-selective fading channels. For BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM modulated
OFDM signals, we derived the BER formulas characterizing the performance degradation
due to phase noise with or without CPE correction based on the conditional Gaussian ap-
proximation. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis. Depending on
the shapes of phase noise spectra, the phase noise effect can be dominated by CPE or ICI,
or both. While the forward CPE compensation has been applied in many practical OFDM
communication systems, the ICI suppression and/or cancellation schemes usually have much
greater computational complexity to hinder its implementation. The analysis and design of
low-complexity ICI compensation methods to counter the detrimental effect of phase noise
are left for further investigation.

Abstract—In this paper, we study the effect of ﬁnite-power,
phase-locked-loop (PLL) based phase noise on the bit-error-rate
(BER) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
systems in frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Based
on the conditional Gaussian approximation technique, we derive
the BER formulas for BPSK and 16-QAM modulated OFDM
signals impaired by phase noise in frequency-selective Rayleigh
fading channels. Simulation results not only validate the accuracy
of our analysis but also show the dependency of BERs on the
shapes of phase noise spectra.
I. INTRODUCTION
The effects of phase noise and its mitigation methods for
OFDM systems have been extensively researched and reported
in literature [1]-[13]. In [1], the two effects of phase noise on
OFDM systems, namely, the common phase error (CPE) and
ICI were analyzed by deriving their second-order statistics.
The authors also proposed a simple CPE correction technique
based on the continual pilot signals. The dependency of ICI
and CPE powers on the power spectrum density of the phase
noise was further characterized in [2]. The signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) degradation of OFDM systems caused by the presence
of phase noise in additive white Gaussian channels (AWGN)
and multipath Rayleigh fading channels were evaluated in [3]-
[6]. Although SNR is a simple way to assess the impact of
phase noise on OFDM systems, BER is a more important and
accurate performance metric. Based on the moment generating
function (MGF) technique and the Gaussian approximation of
ICI, the BER analysis of OFDM systems impaired by Wiener
phase noise in AWGN channels was presented in [7]. For
the case of ﬁnite-power phase noises, the BER results can
be found in [8]-[11]. However, it has been indicated in [12]
and later analyzed in [13], the Gaussian approximation of ICI
is accurate only when the phase noise has larger bandwidth
than the OFDM subcarrier spacing (i.e. fast phase noise) and
the number of subcarriers is large.
Since OFDM systems are usually designed to counter the
detrimental effects of frequency-selective fading channels, it
is important to analytically quantify the BER performance in
the presence of both ﬁnite-power phase noise and frequency-
selective fading. This aspect has not been considered in the
aforementioned works. We apply the BER analysis technique
developed in [14] to the phase noise problem and derive
the BER formulas for various modulations without and with
perfect CPE compensation. Since the channel frequency re-
sponses and the phase noise frequency responses of different
subcarriers are correlated, the signal term and the ICI term for
the data symbol transmitted at each subcarrier are correlated.
Instead of directly invoking the central limit theorem (CLT)
[15] to approximate the ICI as a Gaussian random variable, we
ﬁrst condition the received signal on the channel realization
and CPE. Then we approximate the ICI plus noise term as a
Gaussian random variable and derive the conditional BER ex-
pressions. Finally, the conditional BER formulas are averaged
over the conditional random variables to obtain the average
BERs. Numerical results show that the conditional Gaussian
approximation technique yields accurate BER predictions for
various modulation formats and phase noise spectra.
The notations (·)T and (·)∗ stand for matrix transpose and
complex conjugation, respectively. The expectation taken with
respect to the distribution of the random variable within the
brackets is denoted by E{·}. Finally, the symbol CN (0, σ2)
denotes the circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random
variable with mean 0 and variance σ2/2 in both real and
imaginary components.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Received Signal
The transmitted discrete-time OFDM baseband signal in one
OFDM symbol period is given by
xi =
1√
N
N−1∑
k=0
Xk e
j2πik/N , i = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1 (1)
where k is the index of subcarrier, N is the total number
of subcarriers, and Xk ∈ X is the transmitted modulation
symbol at subcarrier k. For different subcarrier index k, Xk
are independent with average symbol energy Es = E[|Xk|2].
Two types of constellations X are considered in this paper,
namely, BPSK and 16-QAM.
At the transmitter, we assume the cyclic preﬁx whose length
is longer than the maximum delay spread of the multipath fad-
ing channel is inserted at the beginning of each OFDM symbol.
At the receiver, the inserted cyclic preﬁx is discarded in the
demodulation process. Therefore, no intersymbol interference
(ISI) occurs in the received OFDM signals.
The transmitted OFDM signal goes through a time-invariant
frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel whose impulse
response is represented by the tapped-delay line model as
h(t) =
L−1∑
l=0
hlδ(t− lT/N), (2)
where L is the number of multipaths, the path gain hl ∼
CN (0, σ2l ), δ(·) is the Dirac-delta function, and T is the

V0 as a Gaussian random variable is not valid and the ICI
term has a thicker tail. When frequency-selective fading is
present, directly applying the CLT to V0 may overestimate the
BER since the channel response H0 of the desired signal is
correlated with the channel responses H1,H2, · · · ,HN−1 of
the interference term V0. That means the signal power and
the interference power are correlated. Moreover, we note that
the phase noise response Ψ0 is also strongly correlated with
Ψ1,Ψ2, · · · ,ΨN−1.
To compute the BER accurately, we consider to adapt the
performance analysis method developed in [14] to solve our
problems. First, we deﬁne the conditional random variables
ξk = Hk|H0 and ζk = Ψk|Ψ0 where k = 1, 2, · · · , N − 1.
Since H0 and Hk are jointly complex Gaussian, the condi-
tional random variable ξk are also complex Gaussian random
variables [15] with mean and variance
E[ξk] = E[Hk|H0] = H0 ρk0

, (12)
where
ρik = E[HiH∗k ] =
L−1∑
l=0
σ2l e
j2π(k−i)l/N . (13)
Similarly, since Ψk and Ψ0 are jointly complex Gaussian, the
conditional random variable ζk are also complex Gaussian
random variables with mean and variance
E[ζk] = E[Ψk|Ψ0] = Ψ0 ρˆk0
ρˆ00

(15)
To facilitate further performance analysis, we deﬁne two zero-
mean random variables
αk = ξk − E[ξk] ∼ CN (0, ρkk − ρ−100 |ρk0|2), (16)
βk = ζk − E[ζk] ∼ CN (0, ρˆkk − ρˆ−100 |ρˆk0|2). (17)
Conditioned on H0 and Ψ0, the received signal Y0 becomes

invoke the CLT to approximate I0 as a complex Gaussian

λ1 + λ2(Ψ0) + λ3(|H0|2) + λ4(|H0|2,Ψ0) + λ5

where

∣∣ρ−100 ρk0ρˆ−100 ρˆk0∣∣2 |H0|2Ψ20, (23)
λ5 = N0/Es. (24)
In (19), we explicitly express the variance of I0 as a function
of |H0|2 and Ψ0. Next, we will derive the BER formulas for
various modulation formats under the assumption that perfect
channel state information (CSI) is available at the receiver.
A. BPSK
The constellation X of BPSK modulation is {−√Es,
√
Es}.
Conditioned on H0 and Ψ0, the conditional BER is given by
Pb(e|H0,Ψ0) = Pr
(
Re[Z0H∗0 ] < 0|X0 =
√
Es
)
= Pr
(
|H0|2

Es + Re[I0H∗0 ] < 0
)
= Q
(√
2|H0|2
σ2I0(|H0|2,Ψ0)
)
, (25)
where Q(x) = 1√
2π
∫∞
x
e−z
2/2dz. From (25), we know the
CPE term jH0X0Ψ0 does not affect the BER performance
of BPSK modulation. Since H0 ∼ CN (0, 1), the probability
density function (pdf) of |H0|2 is
f|H0|2(x) =
{
e−x, x ≥ 0
0, otherwise . (26)
On the other hand, the random variable Ψ0 = 1N
∑N−1
i=0 ψi
is the sum of N zero mean Gaussian random variables.
Therefore, Ψ0 is also a zero mean Gaussian random variable
with variance σ2Ψ0 = ρˆ00, which has been given explicitly in(15). The pdf of Ψ0 is given by
fΨ0(y) =
1√
2πσ2Ψ0
e−y
2/2σ2Ψ0 , −∞ < y < ∞. (27)
Averaging the conditional BER (25) over the pdfs of |H0|2
and Ψ0, the unconditional BER can be expressed as
Pb(e) =
∫ ∞
−∞
∫ ∞

By suitable change of variables, the double integral in (28)
can be evaluated accurately by using the Gauss-Chebyshev
quadrature rule [16].

the exact BER is slightly higher than the approximate BER
especially when the phase noise power σ2ψ is as large as 0.01.
Since we use the approximation ejψi ≈ 1+jψi to simplify our
analysis, it is worth mentioning that our analysis is accurate
only when |ψi| is far smaller than 1. Fortunately, this condition
holds in most practical OFDM systems.
By comparing Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we learn the BER perfor-
mance of phase noise spectrum A is much worse than that
of phase noise spectrum B when they both have the same
phase noise power σ2ψ. Since the CPE term Ψ0 = 1N
∑N−1
i=0 ψi
is a zero mean Gaussian random variable, we know the
variance of Ψ0 depends not only on the variance of ψi but
also on the correlation between any two different phase noise
samples. Different phase noise spectra may have different
autocorrelation functions R(k) (see (8)), hence different CPE
variances. Besides, the shape of the phase noise spectrum also
affects the ICI variance through ρˆik whose explicit form (13)
is also a function of R(k).
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper studied the effect of phase noise on the BER per-
formance of OFDM systems in frequency-selective Rayleigh
fading channels. For BPSK and 16-QAM modulated OFDM
signals, we derived the BER formulas characterizing the
performance degradation due to phase noise without CPE
correction based on the conditional Gaussian approximation.
Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our analysis.
Depending on the shapes of phase noise spectra, the phase
noise effect can be dominated by CPE or ICI, or both. While
the forward CPE compensation has been applied in many
practical OFDM systems, the ICI suppression and/or cancel-
lation schemes usually have high computational complexity to
hinder their implementation. The analysis and design of low-
complexity ICI compensation methods to counter the detri-
mental effect of phase noise are left for further investigation.

B. Phase Noise Model
We focus on the phase noise in the local oscillator synthe-
sized by PLL. Let ψ(t) be the continuous phase noise process
which is assumed to be a stationary Gaussian random process
with zero mean and PSD speciﬁed by a phase noise mask
Ω(f). For the purpose of performance analysis in next section,
we are interested in the second-order statistical property of the
discrete-time phase noise samples ψi. Let fs be the sampling
frequency and Ts = 1/fs be the sampling period. The ith
phase noise sample is denoted by ψi = ψ(iTs). Then the
autocorrelation function of the phase noise samples ψi is
related to the continuous phase noise spectrum Ω(f) by [9]
R(k) ∆= E[ψiψi+k] =
∫ ∞
−∞
Ω(f)e−j2πkf/fsdf, (8)
and the phase noise power σ2ψ is equal to R(0).
Two speciﬁc phase noise spectra [12] are considered in this
paper. The ﬁrst phase noise spectrum, referred as ”spectrum
A”, can be described mathematically as [1]
ΩA(f) = 10−c+


f2−f1 −a, f1 < f < fs2

is given by

where β is the phase noise 3-dB bandwidth and P is the total

III. BER ANALYSIS
To derive the BER formula, without loss of generality, we
consider subcarrier 0 as the desired subcarrier and the received
OFDM signal in (6) can be rewritten as
Y0 = H0X0 + jH0X0Ψ0 + V0, (11)
where V0 = j
∑N−1
k=1 HkXkΨk + W0 is the sum of ICI
and AWGN. Since V0 is the sum of N uncorrelated random
variables jHkXkΨk and W0, one may try to invoke the CLT
to approximate V0 as a Gaussian random variable with zero
mean and suitable variance when N is large. However, for the
AWGN channel, it has been shown in [13] that approximating

third bits correspond to the inphase (I) bits, while the second
and fourth bits map to the quadrature (Q) bits. The I and Q
components of the 16-QAM symbols are Gray encoded by
assigning the bits 11, 10, 00, 01 to the levels −3d, −d, d, and
3d where d =
√
Es/10. The decision boundaries for the most
signiﬁcant bit (MSB) and least signiﬁcant bit (LSB) of the I/Q
components are shown in Fig. 2(b). Due to the symmetry of I
and Q components, the BERs of the I bits and the Q bits are
the same. For the purpose of BER analysis, we only need to
compute the BER of the I bits.
We deﬁne two sets X1 = {x ∈ X : Re[x] = d} and X2 =
{x ∈ X : Re[x] = 3d}. Since the decision boundary for the
MSB of I bits is the imaginary axis, the BER of the MSB of
I bits conditioned on H0 and Ψ0 is
PMSBb (e|H0,Ψ0) =
1

)
.
(29)
On the other hand, the decision boundaries for the LSB are
I = −2d and I = 2d on the I-Q plane. Therefore, the BER
of the LSB of the I bits conditioned on H0 and Ψ0 is
PLSBb (e|H0,Ψ0) =

The average conditional BER of 16-QAM modulated OFDM

(31)
Finally, the unconditional average BER P 16qamb (e) can be ob-
tained by averaging the conditional probability Pb(e|H0,Ψ0)
over the pdfs f|H0|2(x) and fΨ0(y). Since the pdf fΨ0(y)
is symmetric with respect to the origin, the computa-
tion of P 16qamb (e) can be further simpliﬁed. We can
replace X1, X2, and the constant 1/8 in (29) and
(30) by X˜1 = {x ∈ X : Re[x] = d, Im[x] > 0}, X˜2 =
{x ∈ X : Re[x] = 3d, Im[x] > 0} and 1/4, respectively.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
A. Simulation Setup
We consider an OFDM system with N = 64 subcarriers.
The effective OFDM symbol period is T = 3.2 µs and the
subcarrier frequency spacing ∆f is 312.5 KHz. The sampling
rate of the received signal is fs = 20 MHz. The power delay
proﬁle of the frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel is
exponentially decaying and the root mean square (rms) delay
spread is equal to 100 ns. We also assume the channel is
ﬁxed for the whole frame and is independent from frame to
frame. These parameters and assumptions are typical for the
indoor wireless local area network (WLAN) applications. As
for the parameters in the mathematical models of the phase
noise spectra, we set a = 6.5, b = 4, c = 10.5, f1 = 1 kHz,
and f2 = 10 kHz for phase noise spectrum A. The parameter β
and P in the phase noise spectrum B are set to be 10 kHz and
0.001, respectively [12]. To study the effect of different phase
noise powers σ2ψ on the BER performance, we simply scale
the two phase noise spectra by multiplying suitable constants.
For each of the phase noise spectra considered in this paper,
the ratio of the 3-dB bandwidth and the subcarrier spacing
is much smaller than 1. This corresponds to the practical
case of slow phase noise and the BERs computed based on
the conventional Gaussian approximation are very inaccurate
[13]. In next subsection, we will demonstrate the BERs can
be accurately predicted by using the conditional Gaussian
approximation technique.
B. Results
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the effect of phase noise on the
BER performance of 16-QAM modulated OFDM signals in
frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels with phase noise
spectrum A and B, respectively. The horizontal axis represents
the modulated data symbol SNR Es/N0 and the vertical axis
represents the BER. The dashed lines are obtained from exact
computer simulation without any approximation. On the other
hand, the solid lines are obtained from computer simulation
with approximation ejψi ≈ 1 + jψi when |ψi| << 1. The
markers are computed from our theoretical analysis. From
Figs. 3- 4, we can see the theoretical results and the simulation
results with approximation are matched very well. However,
