英 文 摘 要 ： Different high speed signal remodulation passive 
optical network (PON) solutions up to 10 Gb/s have 
been proposed. Researchers are going to further 
increase the data rate of PON towards 40 Gb/s. 
However, scaling up from 10 Gb/s to 40 Gb/s PON is 
very challenging. In this project, we will focus on 
three areas to achieve the high data rate access 
network of up to 40 Gb/s per wavelength channel: (1) 
First, we will study the challenges of deploying 
single channel 40 Gb/s system. (2) Secondly, we will 
propose and demonstrate a 80 Gb/s/wavelength (using 
40 Gb/s downstream and 40 Gb/s upstream signals) 
signal-remodulation PON using downstream DPSK and 
upstream ASK signals. By using the reduced modulation 
index (RMI) of the downstream DPSK signal, the 
tolerance to the residual chromatic dispersion can be 
greatly enhanced. Due to the reduction of the 
accumulated chromatic dispersion, the quality of the 
upstream remodulated ASK signal can be improved. 
Besides, by detecting the downstream demodulated DPSK 
signal at the destructive output port of the Mach-
Zehnder Interferometer (MZI), good quality of the 
demodulated DPSK signal can still be achieved. (3) 
Finally, A WDM signal-remodulation PON having a total 
capacity of 1.28 Tb/s (16 X 80 Gb/s) will also be 
demonstrated.  
This project can build up the high data rate (up to 
40 Gb/s) fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) technologies for 
our partner in this project: PHYTREX Tech. Corp. 
(headquarter in Taipei, RD team in Hsinchu), which 
devoted to offer advanced photonic and FTTH 
technologies from equipments to system integration 
solutions to customers. This project can also promote 
the collaboration between academic and industries, 
allowing idea and technologies transfer between 
researchers and engineers.

（二）計畫英文摘要。 
Using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is generally considered to be the next step of the 
present passive optical network (PON) to increase the user bandwidth. Although it is technically 
feasible today if WDM lasers are used to provide the upstream customer data channels, but it is 
not cost-effective due to the high inventory and deployment costs of using expensive, 
wavelength-specified laser sources in the customer optical network unit (ONU). A potential 
solution to this problem is to use optical carrier distribution.    
 Different high speed signal remodulation PON solutions up to 10 Gb/s have been proposed. 
Researchers are going to further increase the data rate of PON towards 40 Gb/s. However, scaling 
up from 10 Gb/s to 40 Gb/s PON is very challenging. In this project, we will focus on three areas 
to achieve the high data rate access network of up to 40 Gb/s per wavelength channel: (1) First, 
we will study the challenges of deploying single channel 40 Gb/s system. (2) Secondly, we will 
propose and demonstrate a 80 Gb/s/wavelength (using 40 Gb/s downstream and 40 Gb/s 
upstream signals) signal-remodulation PON using downstream DPSK and upstream ASK signals. 
By using the reduced modulation index (RMI) of the downstream DPSK signal, the tolerance to 
the residual chromatic dispersion can be greatly enhanced. Due to the reduction of the 
accumulated chromatic dispersion, the quality of the upstream remodulated ASK signal can be 
improved. Besides, by detecting the downstream demodulated DPSK signal at the destructive 
output port of the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI), good quality of the demodulated DPSK 
signal can still be achieved. (3) Finally, A WDM signal-remodulation PON having a total capacity 
of 1.28 Tb/s (16 X 80 Gb/s) will also be demonstrated.  
 This project can build up the high data rate 40 Gb/s technologies for our partner in this

The performances of the DPSK-ASK signal-remodulation PON were analyzed in this 
section. Fig. 3.2(a) and (b) shows the Q (dB) of the downstream DPSK and upstream ASK signal 
at 10 Gb/s (downstream) with 2.5 Gb/s (upstream), and symmetric 10 Gb/s respectively. We can 
see that in the case of 10 Gb/s (downstream) and 2.5 Gb/s (upstream), error-free (Q > 15 dB) 
transmission can be achieved in both direction under typical access fiber length of 20 km. This 
implied that dispersion compensation was not required. When using the symmetric 10 Gb/s case, 
the upstream ASK signal was degraded by the accumulated chromatic dispersion. We also 
adjusted the time delay between the downstream DPSK and the upstream ASK signals. We found 
that the performance of the upstream ASK signal depended on the time-delay. In the symmetric 
bit-rate operation, the residual dispersion tolerance was only equivalent to ~5 km of SMF in the 
worst time-delay.  
Then, we increased the bit-rate to 40 Gbs/ (downstream) and 10 Gb/s (upstream), the effect 
of chromatic dispersion increased rapidly. The residual dispersion tolerance of the downstream 
and upstream signals was only equivalent to ~5 km and ~3 km of SMF respectively, as shown in 
Fig. 3.2(c). The situation is even worst when symmetric 40 Gb/s was operated (Fig. 3.2(d)). In 
this case, the upstream ASK signal can only have chromatic dispersion tolerance of ~ 1 km. 
Hence we can see that using symmetric 40 Gb/s in signal remodulation network is very 
challenging and novel scheme is required to improve the network performance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We proposed using reduced modulation index (RMI) to the downstream DPSK signal to 
decrease the accumulated chromatic dispersion of the upstream ASK signal. Hence the reach and 
signal performance of the upstream signal can be greatly enhanced. By reducing the modulation 
index of the DPSK signal, it created another question of how much degradation will be 
introduced to the downstream DPSK signal.  
Then we performed another simulation. According to the simulation results, in the 
demodulation of the DPSK signal using the Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI), reducing the

(2) Experimental demonstration of 40-Gb/s signal-remodulation PON 
(Month 4-9) 
In this section, the proposed symmetric 40 Gb/s signal-remodulation PON using RMI was 
evaluated using experiment. The experimental setup was shown in Fig. 3.1. The transmitter (Tx) 
with output power of 5 dBm was launched into a PM to produce the 40 Gb/s DPSK downstream 
signal. Different RMI was generated by controlling the electrical input signal to the PM. The 
signal was then launched to the colorless ONU. At the ONU, 20% of the downstream signal was 
first demodulated by a MZI with delay of 25 ps and detected by a Rx. The rest of the downstream 
power was remodulated by a 40 GHz MZM at the ONU to generated the upstream ASK signal, 
which was then sent back to the CO. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3.5 shows the BER performance of the downstream DPSK and upstream ASK signals. 
By using RMI, the power penalty of the DPSK increases to 4.5 dB, however, the remodulated 
upstream ASK signal is significantly enhanced from having an error-floor at 10-5 to error-free. 
The corresponding experimental and simulated 40 Gb/s eye-diagrams are shown in the insets. 
Clear open eye of the remodulated upstream ASK signal can be observed showing the proposed 
RMI and MZI-destructive port detection scheme is successful. The experimental eye-shapes also 
match with the simulation. 
 
(3) Experimental demonstration of 16 channel WDM network 
(Month 10-12) 
In this section, a 16 channels signal-remodulation WDM PON experiment was performed. Each 
wavelength channel was measured based on the analysis performed in Month 1-3, and the 
experimental setup done in Month 4-9. Fig. 3.6 show the optical spectra (measured by an optical 
spectrum analyzer with resolution of 0.1 nm) of the (a) downstream and (b) upstream signals in 
the signal-remodulation WDM PON respectively. Using the present wavelength plan, the 
proposed signal-remodulation WDM PON can support a total capacity of 1.28 Tb/s (16 × 80 
Gb/s).
