Abstract 
A robust switching NN based controller for 
strict feedback systems has been developed in 
this project. First, the neural network is used 
to approximate the unknown nonlinearity of 
the system dynamics to render the adaptive 
control applicable; secondly, the switching 
mechanism of our earlier design for feedback 
linearisable systems is included into the robust 
adaptive controller to achieve the desired 
objectives. Simulation results demonstrate that 
it is superior in the simplicity of control 
structure and the ease of implementation 
comparing to existing designs.    
     
Keywords: strict-feedback systems, neural 
networks, switching control, robust adaptive 
control. 
 
一、簡介 
  In the control of complex dynamic systems, 
NNs are widely used for approximating the 
unknown system nonlinearity to facilitate the 
adaptive control design. The degradation in 
tracking performances arising from the 
inevitable approximation errors can be 
minimized by incorporating certain robust 
control algorithms [4,6,7]. 
  However, the singularity phenomenon, 
occurring when the denominator of the 
calculated control being equal or close to zero, 
may cause catastrophic effects in practice and 
has to be prevented in the first place. A recent 
trend in this issue is to apply the NN to 
approximate the reshaped unknown 
nonlinearities instead of the gain functions 
themselves to tacitly avoid the singularity 
[1,8,12]. Using non-minimal sets of NN 
 4
error dynamics can be written as 
zሶ ୧ ൌ g୧ሺxത୧ሻሺz୧ାଵ ൅ α୧ሻ െ f୧ሺxത୧ሻ െ αሶ ୧ିଵ 
zሶ୬ ൌ g୬ሺxሻu െ f୬ሺxሻ െ αሶ ୬ିଵ            
y ൌ xଵ                        (4)  
A popular approach to the stabilization of the 
equilibrium of (4) is the adaptive feedback 
linearizing control. The drawback, as 
mentioned, is the singularity phenomenon. By 
virtue of the universal approximation property, 
Ge [3] utilize the NNs to resemble the 
unknown functionsg୧ିଵሺf୧ െ αሶ ୧ିଵ) to 
circumvent such a difficulty. However, the 
upper bounds of the derivatives of g୧ must be 
known, and ii) g୬ being independent of the 
state x୬ have to be fulfilled first. Regarding 
this, a hybrid adaptive NN controller, 
modified from [5], is proposed to conquer 
such difficulties in the next section.  
 
三、控制設計 
To avoid the singularity, the following smooth 
switching policy is introduced first 
Sሺη, wሻ ؆ 1 െ exp ൬െ ቀ஗
୵
ቁ
ଶ
൰ , ׊η א R   (5) 
where w ൐ 0is the switching transition width 
at disposal. Replacing the η in (5) with gො୧ୟ, 
then Sሺgො୧ୟ, wሻ ൎ 1 indicates a safe operation, 
while Sሺgො୧ୟ, wሻ ൎ 0 signifies the approach of 
singularity. In addition to its smoothness, it 
has two more important properties

ൌ 0   
P2) ρୱ ؠ sup஗ஷ଴

 is well defined. 
  By virtue of P1), the singularity 
phenomenon will be totally avoided, while P2) 
ensures the boundedness of the virtual control 
inputs for all time. The proposed virtual and 
actual controls can be written explicitly as

whereτ୩is specified later. The adaptive 
linearizing control uୟ is for compensating the 
parametric uncertainty in normal operation, 
while the robust adaptive controlu୰, consisting 
of a nominal adaptive compensatorh୬/σ୬ and 
a saturated type of control – γtanh ሺaz୬ሻ for 
suppressing the residual uncertainty is in 
charge when near singularity.  
 By substituting (6)-(8) into (4), after some 
straightforward manipulation, it yields the 
following closed-loop error dynamics

where d and o୧, o୨,୩ are the spread and the 
centers of the gaussian function, respectively. 
We select then୦in (18) to be five, with the 
nodes evenly distributed in ሾെ0.6,0.6ሿ with 
d ൌ 0.3. On the other hand, for approximating 
fଶ andgଶ, there are a total of 25 neurons 
evenly distributed in the square ሾെ0.6,0.6ሿ ൈ
ሾെ0.6,0.6ሿ to account for its additional 
dependence onxଶ. 
The numerical values used in the simulation 
are 
a ൌ 8.0, k୸ ൌ 30.0, k୮ ൌ k୲ ൌ 5.0, γ ൌ 10, 
g୳ଵ ൌ 2, g୳ଶ ൌ 4, g୫ଵ ൌ 0.5, g୫ଶ ൌ 0.7. 
The initial values for the states and the 
estimated neural weights are assigned with 
random numbers within ሾ0,0.1ሿ. The output 
tracking result is depicted in Fig. 1. It is quite 
satisfactory even under such a small amount 
of employed neurons. Noticeably, the 
singularity-induced spike occurring in the 
adaptive linearizing control in Fig. 2 was 
successfully prevented by the proposed design, 
as can be seen from Fig. 3. 
 
五、結論 
  Based on the design in [3], hybrid NN 
backstepping controllers have been proposed   
for achieving the practical tracking stability of 
strick-feedback systems. The switching 
mechanism embedded in the control algorithm 
has succeeded in avoiding the possible 
singularity of the calculated control input, 
which is further validated by the    
simulation results shown in Figs. 1-3.     
Besides conquering the drawbacks listed in 
the end of Section 2, this design retains the 
simple structure of the adaptive linearizing 
control to a greatest extent, making it easier to 
implement. Under such a controller structure, 
the NN can be directly applied to approximate 
the original unknown nonlinearity instead of 
any reshaped ones. An immediate advantage is 
that it can be directly applied to systems with 
linear-in-parameter nonlinearity to achieve 
asymptotic tracking stability, while the 
designs of [8] or [12] can't.  The control 
authorityα୧୰, consisting of a nominal adaptive 
control and a saturated type of control, is in 
charge when near singularity. However, the 
saturated type of control is not the only choice 
at all. Actually, as can be easily verified, any 
kind of robust control which ensures the UUB 
of the equilibrium of the error system qualifies 
as a candidate. Picking up the best candidate 
would then depend on various design criteria. 
For instance, when the bound ν୧ for h୧is not

一、參加會議經過 
此次會議有四天的時間，我下榻的旅館正好就是會議舉行地，所以要聽其餘專家學者的
演講，搭個電梯即可。由於個人專長在控制理論及相關應用，而此會議涵蓋範圍及議題
頗為廣泛，在七月十三當天有兩個時段 13:05-14:50，15:10-16:55 及十四日的
11:50-13:10 共三個時段有相關之議題安排，我也在其中選擇有興趣或相關場次聆聽，
收獲良多。而個人論文展示安排在 7/14 下午，在展示期間，有大陸當地學者提問到我
研究的內容並給了一些建議，主要在強建性方面的進一步考慮問題，相當有建設性，有
寶貴意見交換是參加國際會議最吸引人處。遺憾的是，由於我七月十五日需參加事先安
排好在台科大舉辦為期四日之自動光學檢測研習會，在個人論文展示結束後，即趕赴機
場，結束此次難得的國際會議經驗。 
 
二、與會心得 
此項會議雖為較小型之國際會議，但主辦單位相當用心，舉凡會議論文集、光碟之製作、
會場安排皆令人印象深刻。但是會場接待的同學態度冷淡，相較去年日本的國際會議，
日本人親切問候並主動提供協助的熱情，大陸方面仍有許多改善空間。此外，一些華人
演講的場次，由於是研究生上場的關係，怯場或結巴的現象常發生，也是值得再改進處。
雖然如此，整體水準仍是瑕不掩瑜，在其中聆聽感覺收穫良多，獲益非淺。
