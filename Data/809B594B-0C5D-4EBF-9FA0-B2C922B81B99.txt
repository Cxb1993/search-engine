一、中文摘要 
經濟批量排程問題是針對單一生產設備的數
種產品，探討其批量大小，並調整其週期生
產的排程，使其生產計劃為可行，又能滿足
顧客的需求，且平均總成本達到最小的存貨
控制問題。在本計畫中，希望配合產品與製
造性系統的特性，將經濟批量排程問題進行
延伸研究。 
在許多產業，決策者正面對產品具有損
耗特性下之經濟批量排程問題，例如：(1)蔬
菜、水果、生鮮食品等易腐敗之食物；(2)汽
油、酒精等揮發性之液體；(3)電子元件之功
能退化、輻射性物質蛻變、底片的變質、藥
物過期所導致的失效等。本計畫第一年計畫
名稱為：「在產品具損耗特性下之最佳經濟批
量排程問題與三種排程策略比較之研究」，探
討下列兩個研究主題： 
研究主題一：在求解產品具損耗特性下之經
濟批量排程問題之最佳解搜尋演算法 
因為主持人已經發表論文的研究方法，
無法應用於「一般整數策略」下的求解，而
且對於求解大型問題時，收斂速度通常較
慢。故在求解方法的設計上，本研究計畫希
望可以直接針對產品具有損耗特性下之經濟
批量排程問題的數學模式，進行比較深入的
理論分析，並透過最佳解結構的探討，設計
搜尋演算法。 
研究主題二：在經濟批量排程問題中，常用
的三種排程策略之比較 
    文獻中未見有學者提出研究論文，對於
經濟批量排程問題常用的三種排程策略，在
不同的參數組合下，進行求解品質之比較。
因為此關乎決策者面對問題時，應該選擇何
種排程策略，直接影響其求解品質，故為一
個非常重要的議題。 
 另外，在許多產業中（例如：金屬沖件、
電子裝置、汽車、油漆、飲料、動物食品、
紡織品及地毯等產業），生產系統擁有平行的
多部機台，決策者正面對多機經濟批量排程
問題，此為本計畫今年所探討經濟批量排程
問題之延伸研究。本研究第二年計畫名稱：
「求解相同與異質平行機台生產系統中最佳
經濟批量排程問題之研究」，探討下列兩個研
究主題： 
研究主題一：求解相同平行機台生產系統中
之最佳經濟批量排程問題 
在本研究主題下，希望運用朝兩個方向
進行探討：(1)運用啟發式程序或動態批量法
的排程策略，分別在「二冪策略」及「一般
整數策略」下進行求解；(2)直接針對數學模
式，進行比較深入的理論分析，並透過最佳
解結構的探討，設計搜尋演算法，使其求解
速度比文獻中的解法更快，求解的品質更加
穩定。 
研究主題二：求解異質平行機台生產系統中
之最佳經濟批量排程問題 
本研究主題希望探討下列兩個方向：(1)
將主持人先前求解相同平行機台生產系統中

production schedule, and (2) conduct full 
theoretical analysis on the mathematical model 
and design an optimal search algorithm. Then, 
we may compare the solution quality and the 
efficiency of the both solution approaches.    
Sub-topic 2: New Solution Approaches for 
Solving the Economic Lot Scheduling 
Problem with Non-identical Parallel 
Facilities 
We employ two approaches to solve the 
concerned problem in this study: (1) modify the 
genetic algorithm proposed in the author’s 
previous study, and apply it to solve the 
problem here, and (2) conduct full theoretical 
analysis on the mathematical model and design 
an optimal search algorithm based on our 
theoretical results. Then, compare the two 
approaches using random experiments. 
We strongly believe that the deliveries of 
our project shall serve an important foundation 
for establishing a Decision-Support System 
(DSS) or an Advanced Planning and Scheduling 
(APS) for production managers in industries. 
Keywords: Economic Lot Scheduling Problem, 
Scheduling Strategies, Parallel Facilities,

二、緣由與目的 
基於現實生活中更合理的假設，本研究
將損耗性因素納入 ELSP 模式中探討。由於
ELSP 已被確認是一個難解的非多項式演算
法（NP-hard）可解的存貨問題，原本就不易
確保所求的解為合理可行，而在多部平行機
台的情境下，會使得問題更趨複雜。 
總括來說，本研究旨在個別探討對產品
具有損耗特性下及多部平行機台的之經濟批
量排程的生產模式，使用不同的數學模式與
結合啟發式演算法來獲得一個確實可行、成
本更低的生產計劃排程。

第二研究主題的內容：產品的參數設定對三
種 ELSP 解法之績效的影響 
第二研究主題的研究成果彙整如下： 
本研究以 Bomberger (1966)的產品參數
值域為基礎，用以下幾個產品參數設定方式
(參考圖 1)，以平均分配來隨機產生產品之參
數，用來評量 CC 法、TVLS 法和 EBP 法求
解 ELSP 之表現。 
 
 
圖 1：不同參數設定的相關性 
 
這些產品參數設定方式可以描述如下： 
1. Case A：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
作為建立產品參數的基礎。 
2. Case B1：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
為基礎，但整置成本的值域從(0, 400]變
更成(0, 200]，以建立產品的參數。 
3. Case B2：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
為基礎，但整置成本的值域從(0, 400]變
更成[200, 400]，以建立產品的參數。 
4. Case C1：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
為基礎，但整置時間的值域從[0.06, 0.50]
變更成[0.03, 0.25]，以建立產品的參數。 
5. Case C2：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
為基礎，但整置時間的值域從[0.06, 0.50]
變更成[0.31, 0.53]，以建立產品的參數。 
6. Case D1：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
為基礎，但整置成本的值域從(0, 400]變
更成[200, 400]，整置時間的值域從[0.06, 
0.50]變更成[0.03, 0.25]，以建立產品的參
數。 
7. Case D2：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
為基礎，但整置成本的值域從(0, 400]變
更成(0, 200]，整置時間的值域從[0.06, 
0.50]變更成[0.03, 0.25]，以建立產品的參
數。 
8. Case D3：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
為基礎，但整置成本的值域從(0, 400]變
更成(0, 200]，整置時間的值域從[0.06, 
0.50]變更成[0.31, 0.53]，以建立產品的參
數。 
9. Case D4：以 Bomberger(1966)的參數值域
為基礎，但整置成本的值域從(0, 400]變
更成[200, 400]，整置時間的值域從[0.06, 
0.50]變更成[0.31, 0.53]，以建立產品的參
數。 
而在上述各種參數設定情況下，本研究
進一步考量以下的測試狀況： 
1. 不 同 程 度 的 負 荷 程 度 ： 負 荷 程 度
( ∑= i ii pd / )從 0.5 到 09，以 0.1 作間隔，
劃分成 4 個負荷程度水準。 
2. 不同數量的產品數：一個機台生產的產品
數有 10、20 和 30 個等三種可能。 
因此，本研究討論的測試案例共有 9 種
參數設定、4 個負荷程度、3 種產品數和 3 種
ELSP 解法，一共有 324 種組合的測試案例。
每一種測試案例隨機產生 20 個測試問題，取
其成本的平均數作為該案例的績效表現。

1.2 以 EBP 方式求解的架構 
如果將所有（n 種）產品之生產，指派至
所有之（m 部）生產機台，如果每一部機台
都可以產生一個可行的生產排程，則各部機
台的最佳解求解，可以視為個別的單機經濟
批量排程問題。 
在單機的經濟批量排程問題，Yao and 
Elmaghraby (2001)已經針對無產能限制下的
ELSP，提出完整的理論分析。另外，在 Yao 
(2001) 及 Yao, Elmaghraby and Chen (2003) 
的論文中，提出可行解測試演算法 Proc. FT，
在給定產品乘數集合{ki}及基本週期 B 的前
提下，可以產生其最佳的生產排程；此一單
機的經濟批量排程問題之最佳解解法，因為
運用理論分析中的接合點為基本架構，故又
稱為接合點搜尋法 (Junction Point Search 
Algorithm, JPSA)。 
本研究的目的是提出兩個方法：兩階段
GA 法和一階段 GA 法，以有效地使用 JPSA
找出多機 ELSP(n 個產品和 m 個機台)的最佳
解。此外，Carrno (1990)是目前已知較佳的多
機 ELSP 解法。因此，本研究結合 Carreno 法
和 JPSA 作為求解多機 ELSP 的比較基準。這
幾個方法的主要差別在於求解多機 ELSP 的
指派問題之方法的不同。這幾個方法分別說
明如下(如圖 4)： 
 
圖 4：以 EBP 法求解的架構 
1. Carreno-JPSA法：此法使用Carreno (1990)
的方法來獲得一個合適的指派結果，再用
JPSA 求解各機台的總成本，以求得多機
ELSP 的平均總成本。 
2. 兩階段 GA 法：先以 GA 以機台的負荷
平衡為目標函數來搜尋指派結果；將收集到
的個體(代表一指派結果)依平衡程度從小
到大加以排序，再依序使用 JPSA 來求取各
機台的平均總成本，以得到多機 ELSP 的總
成本。當 JPSA 發現一組指派結果是可行解
時，便可停止運算；因為，此方法是基於機
台負荷越平衡，則有越高的機會找到多機
ELSP 的最低平均總成本。 
3. 一階段 GA 法：GA 以 JPSA 求得所有機
台的總成本作為目標函數來搜尋最佳的指
派結果。GA 的目標函數即是多機 ELSP 的
解答；因此，此方法搜尋到的指派結果即是
擁有最低總成本的最佳指派結果。 
 
1.3. 使用JPSA求解單機ELSP的成本 
已知Carreno法或GA的產品和機台的指
派結果，則應用 JPSA 求取多機 ELSP 的程序
可以概略描述如下： 
1. 令 j=1。 
2. 已知單一機台 j 生產哪些產品，使用 JP 定
位程序找出機台 j 的所有接合點{Bj}。 
3. 對機台 j 而言，對接合點之 Bj值從大到小
加以排序。 
4. 使用 K-PoT 搜尋程序找到機台 j 的每個接
合點相對的產品 i 之週期乘數 ki，亦即
{ki(Bj)}。 
5. 依據接合點的(Bj, {ki(Bj)})，計算出各個接
合點的成本 TCj(Bj, {ki(Bj)})。 
6. 依據 TCj(Bj, {ki(Bj)})，將各接合點從小到
大加以排序。 
7. 使用 Proc FT 找出可以建立可行排程的機
台 j 之最低成本。 
8. 令 j=j+1，若 j<=n，則回到步驟 1，否則結
束此程序。 
理想上，加總各機台的最低成本，即可
得到在該次產品和機台的指派結果下之最低
總成本，此即為多機 ELSP 的解。但是，機台
j 的最低成本之解答不一定可以建立可行的

2.2 兩種解法 
本研究提出兩種求解的方法：運用
Carreno’s (1990) 啟發式解法及所提出的遺傳
演算法將產品指派到各機器上，然後在動態
批量法的前提下，再運用 Dobson (1987) 啟發
式解法將各機器上的產品進行各個產品求解
最佳排程；前者我們稱之為 Carreno-Dobson
啟發式解法，後者我們稱之為 GA-Dobson 演
算法。 
 Carreno-Dobson 啟發式解法的架構，請
參見如圖 5。 
 第二種解法為運用遺傳演算法將產品指
派到各機器上，再運用 Dobson (1987) 啟發式
解法將各機器上的產品進行各個產品求解最
佳排程。遺傳演算法的編碼採整數編碼，請

圖 5：Carreno-Dobson 啟發式解法的架構 
 
 
圖 6：遺傳演算法的整數編碼 
 
 在遺傳演算法的選擇機制中，我們採取
「輪盤法」(roulette wheel mechanism)。因為
本研究問題為將目標值最小化，故我們運用
「適應值正規化」(fitness normalization)的手
法，計算適當的染色體演化機率。 
 在遺傳運算子的部分，本研究嘗試過「雙
切點交配演算子」(two cut-point crossover 
operator)及「均勻交配演算子」(uniform 
crossover operator)。在突變演算子，則以隨機
方式挑選基因，然後在隨機選擇1至m之間任
一整數，作為機器的重新指派。

1 INTRODUCTION
Since the lot sizing strategies are critical to the efficiency of production and
inventory systems problems, they have been studied for more than five decades
in the literature and it is. The Economic Lot Scheduling Problem (ELSP)
is one of the most representative problems since it requires both lot sizing
and production scheduling decision-making at the same time. A great deal of
research has been devoted to the extensions of the ELSP. (We will present our
literature review on the ELSP in Section 1.2 later.) On the other hand, some
production systems may shift from an in-control state into an out-of-control
state after an unknown period of time. Therefore, inspection plays an important
role as a way of detection to avoid the production system keep manufacturing
defective units. Also, it keeps away from sending defective units to customers
so as to save possible warranty or returning costs. Many researchers have
paid attention to the lot sizing problem considering inspection for decades.
Most of them assume that only single item is produced when formulating their
models. (We will have further discussions on the literature review in Section
1.3.) However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no ELSP model takes
into account inspection in the literature. Therefore, we are motivated to solve
the ELSP considering inspection in production system, which is named as the
Economic Lot and Inspection Scheduling Problem (ELISP), in this study. We
divide our discussions in this section into three parts. The first part reviews
the background and the solution approaches for solving the conventional ELSP.
The second part surveys the extensions of the ELSP in the literature. We will
present a thorough review on the lot sizing models considering inspection in
the third part.
1.1 A Brief Review of the Conventional ELSP
The conventional ELSP is concerned with the scheduling of cyclical production
of n ≥ 2 items on a single facility in equal lots over an infinite planning horizon,
assuming known and constant demands for each item. The objective of the
ELSP is to determine the lot size and the production schedule of each item
so as to minimize the total cost incurred per unit time. The costs considered
include the setup cost and inventory holding cost. The ELSP has been studied
for more than 50 years since it was first introduced by Rogers, J. (1958) and it
is known as an NP-hard problem (Hsu, W. (1983)).
Researchers had proposed several solution methodologies for solving the con-
ventional ELSP. One may easily obtain the solution of the independent solution
(IS) approach by summing the objective function values from the optimal solu-
tions of the economic production quantity (EPQ) model of n items (which can
be viewed as the lower bound of the cost for the ELSP). But, the IS approach
is not able to ensure the feasibility of the production schedule on a facility.
4experiments show that their algorithm outperforms Ham, I. (1985)and Kuo, H.
(1990) heuristics.
Tang, O. (2006) proposed an ELSP model with returns (ELSPR). They
assume that the manufacturing of the regular items and the re-manufacturing
for the returned items are manufactured using the same production facility.
Later, Teunter, R. (2008)) developed another ELSPR model in which dedicated
production lines are employed for the manufacturing of the regular items and
the re-manufacturing. Yao, M.J., Chang, Y.J. (2009) revised Tang, O. (2006)
model and proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) using the CC approach
to solve ELSP with reworks in which the production system deals with two
sources of items: manufacturing of the serviceable items and remanufacturing
of the rework items. Ouyang, H. (2008) proposed another revised ELSP model
considering manufacturing and remanufacturing on the same single production
line. They also employed the CC approach for their model formulation.
Following our literature review, we learn that the CC approach is the most
popular solution approach for the extensions of the ELSP. However, we did not
locate any extension of the ELSP that takes into account the inspection of the
items in a production run. Therefore, we are motivated to study the Economic
Lot Sizing and Inspection Problem in this study.
1.3 Review on the Lot Sizing Models Considering Inspection
The production process of a deteriorating production system may transit from
the “in-control” (producing good quality units) state to the “out-of-control”
(producing defective units) state after a period of manufacturing operations.
In most of the real-world cases, the production managers monitor and con-
trol the state of the production process by periodic inspection or maintenance
mechanisms. Obviously, detecting defective units by periodic inspections in-
curs an inspection cost, and it may grow with the number of inspections for
a production run. However, the managers and the operators may tune the
production facility and prevent keep producing defecting items as they identify
the “out-of-control” state. Therefore, periodic inspections may save the war-
rantee cost from the returned items or the restoration costs for the detected
defective items. Many researchers were interested in deriving the optimal in-
spection policy (i.e., the determination of the optimal number of inspections
in a production run) for the items in a production system over the last two
decades.
Porteus, E.L. (1986) and Rosenblatt, M.J. (1986a) considered the manufac-
turing process is in an in-control state at the beginning of each production run
in their decision-making scenario. Both of them formulated the deteriorating
manufacturing process as a random process and derived the optimal inspec-
tion policy using an EPQ-based model. Later, Porteus, E.L. (1990) and Wang,
C.H. (2001) revised Porteus, E.L. (1986) model and proposed new solution
approaches for obtaining the optimal inspection policy.
Similar to Porteus’ study, Lee H.L. (1987, 1989) formulated an EPQ model
that jointly determines the production cycle time and the inspection schedule
6an integrated model of production, maintenance, inspection and inventory for
a deteriorating production system.
From the literature above, we find most of research has focus on the produc-
tion lot sizing model with single item. There exists no study on the multi-item
lot-sizing problem that focuses on the inspection of the items in a production.
Therefore, it motivates us to study the ELSP with multi-item lot-sizing problem
to fill this research gap.
The organization of the rest of this research is as follows. We present a
mathematical model for the ELISP under the CC approach in Section 2. Then,
Section 3 presents full theoretical analysis on the optimal objective function
value curve. Based on our theoretical results, we propose an effective search
algorithm in Section 4. The first part of Section 5 demonstrates the implemen-
tation of the proposed algorithm via a numerical example. Then, the second
part employs randomly generated instances to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed search algorithm. Finally, we address our concluding remarks in Sec-
tion 6.
2 THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL
In this section, we will first define the notations for our model formulation, and
then, present the mathematical model.
We define the notations for our model formulation as follows. (Additional
notations will be defined upon their appearance or usage.)
n The number of items.
di The demand rate of item i.
pi The production rate of item i.
T The replenishment cycle time. (decision variable)
Qi The production lot size of item i.
ui The inspection lot size of item i.
ρi ρi ≡ di/pi, the utilization rate of item i.
Ai The setup cost for the production of item i.
ci The setup cost for the each inspection lot of item i.
vi The inspection cost of an unit for the inspection of item i.
ri The restoration cost for the inspection of item i.
mi The number of inspection lots in a production run for item i. (de-
cision variable)
hi The holding cost of item i per unit, per unit time.
si The setup time of item i.
zi The setup time for the inspection of item i.
yi The inspection time of item i per unit.
pii The cost incurred by producing a defective unit of item i.
αi The probability with which the manufacturing process shifts into
the out-of-control state when producing item i.
TC(m, T ) The average cost per unit of time incurred in the production-
inventory system, where m = (m1,m2, . . . ,mn).
8is performed in this study, it incurs an inspection (variable) cost of vi for
each unit. So, we have a total of Qivi = Tdivi inspection cost for item i.
(3) The expected restoration cost: Using the results in Porteus, E.L. (1990), we
may show that the expected restoration cost is given by (T 2d2iαiri)/2mi.
(4) The capacity cost from producing defective product: It can be shown that
for item i, the capacity cost incurred by producing defective units is given
by (T 2d2iαipii)/2mi.
(5) The inventory holding cost: The average inventory holding cost for item
i is given by hidi(1 − ρi)T/2. Following the derivation above, we should
have the average total costs given by
∑n
i=1{Ai+cimiT + divi + hiTdi(1−ρi)2 +
αid
2
iT
2mi
(pii+ri)}. Since the term divi is a constant and will not play a role in
optimization, we will not include in the objective function of the proposed
model.
Now, we are ready to formulate a mathematical model for the Economic
Lot and Inspection Scheduling Problem (ELISP). It shall assist the decision
maker in the determination of the optimal production lot sizing and the optimal
production and inspection schedule of each item in the concerned production
system.

mi ≤ Qi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n (2.4)
The objective function in eq. (2.1) summarizes the cost terms in the total
costs per unit time. Besides, we include two more capacity constraints for
production and inspection in (2.2) and (2.3), respectively. The rationale of
the capacity constraints is the sum of the setup time and the processing (or
inspection) time included in a cycle must not exceed the cycle length. Also,
inequalities (2.4) require that the number of inspection lots must be less than
production quantity for each item.
3 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
In this section, we present some theoretical results that provide insights into
the characteristics of the optimal value of the objective function in eq. (2.1).

Figure 3.1 The value of TCi(mi, T ) using different values of mi
Lemma 3.1 is an immediate result from (3.5).
Lemma 3.1 For item i, the optimal number of inspections for any T is given
by
m∗i (T ) =

√
2cix(x+ 1)/αid2i (ri + pii)
]
where x ≥ 2.
(3.6)
Lemma 3.1 helps us in obtaining the item i’s optimal number of inspections
when searching along the T -axis. Theorem 3.1 provides more insights into the
characteristic of the curve of TCi(T ).
Theorem 3.1 Suppose m(L)i and m
(R)
i , respectively, are the optimal numbers
of the left-side and right-side convex curves with regard to a junction point of
the function TCi(T ). Then m
(R)
i = m
(L)
i + 1.
Proof: Suppose that T1 and T2 are located at the left side and the right side of
a certain junction point wi(mi) (with T1 < wi(mi) < T2). From Lemma 3.1, the
numbers of inspection for T1 and T2 arem
(L)
i = x andm
(R)
i = x+1, respectively,
for some positive integer x. Therefore, it holds that m(R)i = m
(L)
i + 1.
Fig. 3.2 depicts the curve of TCi(T ). Interestingly, it shows that TCi(T ) is
a piece-wise convex function of all items with respect to T .
Lemma 3.2 TCi(T ) is a piece-wise convex function with respect to T . Also,
for each mi, one can obtain the local minima for TCi(T ) at T˘i(mi) with the
12
Theorem 3.2 The TC(T ) function is piece-wise convex with respect to T .
Proof: We first define
gi(T ) = Ai/T + hidiT (1− ρi)/2. (3.10)
Then, TC(T ) =
∑n
i=1 TCi(T ) +
∑n
i=1 gi(T ).
From eq. (3.10), we know that since the second derivative of gi(T ) is positive
since d
2gi(T )
dT 2 =
2Ai
T 3 > 0, for Ai, T > 0. Therefore, we assert that gi(T ) is a
convex with respect to T .
Recall that Lemma 3.2 asserts that TCi(T ) is piece-wise convex with respect
to T . Following the fact that TC(T ) =
∑n
i=1 TCi(T )+
∑n
i=1 gi(T ), we conclude
that TC(T ) is piece-wise convex with respect to T since it is the sum of n convex
functions (namely, gi(T )) and n piece-wise convex functions (namely, TCi(T )).
Theorem 3.3 All the junction points for each individual item i will be inher-
ited by the TC(T ) curve.
Proof: One may easily observe that TC(T ) is a separable function. Without
loss of generality, assume that w is a junction point for an item i, but not a
junction point for the other (n − 1) items. Then, there must exist ε > 0 such
that the followings hold.
1. The curve for
∑
j 6=i TCj(T ) is convex in the interval of [w−ε, w+ε] since
each one of TCj(T ) is convex in [w − ε, w + ε] where j 6= i.
2. TCi(T ) is convex in the intervals of [w − ε, w] and [w,w + ε].
3.
∑n
i=1 gi(T ) is convex in the intervals of [w − ε, w] and [w,w + ε].
Since TC(T ) =
∑
j 6=i TCj(T )+TCi(T )+
∑n
i=1 gi(T ), TC(T ) is still convex in
the intervals [w − ε, w] and [w,w + ε]. Therefore, w is a junction point on the
curve of TC(T ).
4 THE PROPOSED SEARCH ALGORITHM
In this section, we present a search scheme, which obtains an optimal solution
for our ELISP model. Note that we consider the constraints for the production
capacity and the inspection capacity as performing the search algorithm.
Our theoretical results in Section 3 encourage us to solve the problem in
(2.1) to (2.4) by searching along the T -axis. We first need to define the search
range by a lower bound and an upper bound on the T -axis. Also, if we are
able to obtain all of the local minima for each convex curve on TC(T ) in the
search range, we surely can obtain an optimal solution by picking the one with
the lowest objective value.
In the following subsections, we first derive a lower bound on the search
range. Then, we demonstrate how to use the junction points to proceed with
the search. In addition, we propose an approach to obtain and revise the
upper bound on the search range. Finally, we summarize the proposed search
algorithm.
14
4.2 Proceeding with the search by junction points
In this section we show how to proceed with the search by utilizing a sequence of
(sorted) junction points. By Theorem 3.1 and 3.3, each junction point wi(mi)
provides the information that one should change the optimal number of in-
spection of item i from mi to mi + 1 at wi(mi) to obtain the optimal value
for the TC(T ) function. Therefore, during the search, we need to keep an n-
dimensional vector (w1(m∗1 + 1), w2(m
∗
2 + 1), . . . , wn(m
∗
n + 1)) in which each
value of wi(m∗i + 1) indicates the location of the next junction point of each
item i where the item i’s optimal number of inspections should be changed. As
the algorithm search toward larger values of T , one should change the number
of inspections for the particular item i with the smallest value of wi(m∗i + 1)
to currently update the vector of optimal numbers of inspections. Let Tc rep-
resents the current value of T where the search algorithm reaches. Denote δ as
the item index for the item i with the smallest value of wi(m∗i + 1), i.e.,
δ = argmin
i
{wi(m∗i + 1) > Tc} (4.3)
Denote the vector of the optimal numbers of inspection at Tc by m(Tc), i.e.,
m(Tc) = (m∗1(Tc),m
∗
2(Tc), . . . ,m
∗
n(Tc)). Since the optimal number of inspec-
tion should not exceed the size of inspection lot for each item, during the search,
i.e. mi ≤ Qi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. So, mi = Qi for item i is reached, then we do not
change the inspection number mi of item i in following search process.
If m∗i (Tc) ≤ Qi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, then we have to process with the search
from Tc, by Theorem 3.1, we need to update the vector of optimal numbers of
inspection at wδ(m∗δ + 1) by
m (wδ(m∗δ + 1)) ≡ (m(Tc) \ {m∗δ}) ∪ {m∗δ + 1} (4.4)
where ‘\’ denotes set subtraction.
Let {wj} be the sequence of points that the algorithm reaches. In addition,
by the definition, we have w0 ≡ TUB . From another point of view, the algo-
rithm searches over the set {wj}, a sequence of junction points from w0, where
wj+1 ≥ wj , j = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Note that this array is sorted on the location of the
junction points in ascending order except that the initial point TUB may not be
a junction point. Lemma 3.1 asserts that the vector of optimal numbers of in-
spection for the TC(T ) function is invariant between wj+1 and wj . Therefore,
m(wj) is the vector of optimal numbers of inspection for the TC(T ) function in
the interval (wj+1, wj ]. Denote as T˘ (m(wj)) the local minimum for the vector
of optimal numbers of inspection m(wj) where T˘ (m(wj)) can be obtained by
eq. (4.2).
4.3 Upper bound
Note that the search stops when it surpasses the upper bound of the search
range. Therefore, the upper bound serves as the termination condition of the
proposed search algorithm. We derive an upper bound for such a purpose in
this section.
16
We note that the function φi(m∗i (T˘ ), T˘ ) indicates the maximum magnitude of
decrement in TCi(mi, T ) from T˘ to any larger value of T . At the local minimum
T˘ , two possible cases exist for φi(m∗i (T˘ ), T˘ ) based on m
∗
i (T˘ ); i.e., the item i’s
optimal number of inspections:
1. The case of m∗i (T˘ ) = 1: From Lemma 3.2, we assert that the minimum
value of TCi(mi, T ) is
√
2ciαid2i (ri + pii). Then, we may easily have
φi(m∗i (T˘ ), T˘ ) by
φi(m∗i (T˘ ) = 1, T˘ ) = ci/T˘ +αid
2
i T˘ (pii+ri)/2−
√
2ciαid2i (ri + pii). (4.11)
2. The case of m∗i (T˘ ) > 1: From Fig. 3.2, we are sure that
TCi(m∗i (T˘ ), T˘ )
≤ max{TCi(m∗i (T˘ ), wi(m∗i (T˘ ))), TCi(m∗i (T˘ ), wi(m∗i (T˘ ) + 1))}.
(4.12)
In fact, we can easily show that
TCi(m∗i (T˘ ), wi(m
∗
i (T˘ ))) ≥ TCi(m∗i (T˘ ), wi(m∗i (T˘ ) + 1)). (4.13)
Therefore, we have the value of φi(m∗i (T˘ ), T˘ ) given by
φi(m∗i (T˘ ), T˘ )
= TCi(m∗i (T ), T )−
√
2ciαid2i (ri + pii)
=
(2m∗i (T ) + 1)ci
√
2m∗i (T )(m
∗
i (T ) + 1)ci
√
αid2i (ri + pii)
2m∗i (T )(m
∗
i (T ) + 1)ci
−
√
2ciαid2i (ri + pii)
=
√
ciαid2i (ri + pii)
(
(2m∗i (T ) + 1)
√
2m∗i (T )(m
∗
i (T ) + 1)
2m∗i (T )(m
∗
i (T ) + 1)
−
√
2
)
(4.14)
By summarizing both cases above, we have the expression of φi(m∗i (T˘ ), T˘ ) in
(4.7).
The upper bound is derived by asserting that for T ≥ β, the increment in
the sum of holding cost, i.e.,
∑n
i=1 hidi(1−ρi)(T− T˘ )/2, must exceed the maxi-
mum magnitude of decrement from the setup cost
∑n
i=1Ai/T−
∑n
i=1Ai/T˘ and∑n
i=1 φi(m
∗
i (T˘ ), T˘ ), or
∑n
i=1 hidi(1−ρi)(T−T˘ )/2 ≥
(∑n
i=1Ai/T −
∑n
i=1Ai/T˘
)
+
∑n
i=1 φi(m
∗
i (T˘ ), T˘ ), which gives exactly eq. (4.5).
After obtaining a new local minimum during the search, we should try to
revise the upper bound TUB by TUB = min{TUB , β}, where β is obtained from
eq. (4.5).
18
and secure the sorted sequence {wi} by sorting the junction points in
[TLB , TUB) in an ascending order; otherwise, let TC(m∗, T ∗) =∞.
(f) Set j = 1 and Tc = wj .
2. The search procedure:
(a) Obtain m(wj) by m(wj) ≡ (m(Tc) \ {mδ}) ∪ {mδ + 1} and proceed
to wj+1 with δ = argi{wi(mi + 1) = wj+1};
(b) Check the feasibility of (m(wj), T˘ (m(wj))), update the value of T to
secure feasibility if necessary, and calculate TC(m(wj), T˘ (m(wj))),
and try to revise the best-on-hand upper bound TU .
(c) If TC(m(wj), T˘ (m(wj))) < TC(m∗, T ∗), update m∗ and T ∗ with
T ∗ = T˘ (m(wj)) (or the minimum value of T to secure a feasible
solution) and m∗ =m(wj).
3. The termination condition of the search algorithm: If wj+1 > TUB , out-
put m∗, T ∗ and TC(m∗, T ∗) and the algorithm terminates; otherwise,
set j = j + 1 and Tc = wj , then go to Step 2.
5 NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we first present a numerical example to demonstrate the imple-
mentation of the proposed search algorithm. In the second part of this section,
we will use random experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed search
algorithm.
5.1 A demonstrative example
The numerical example presented in this subsection demonstrates the imple-
mentation of the proposed search algorithm. Table 5.1 presents a set of param-
eters used in this numerical example. (We note that the data of setup cost,
setup time, demand rate, production rate and holding cost in Table 5.1 come
from Fujita, S. (1978)’s Example 1 paper.)

u = (1290, 1524, 780, 771, 1676, 3352, 1006, 304, 528, 1863).
5.2 Random Examples
This section will show the effectiveness of the proposed search algorithm using
random experiments. Table 5.3 presents the set of the parameters (and the
uniform distributions) to randomly generate experimental instances. The four
parameters including Ai, di, pi and hi in Table 5.3 are presented in Carreno, J.
(1990) paper. Our experiments were conducted on a personal computer with a
Centrino 1.7GHz CPU and 1G memory.

example.

We would like to observe the effectiveness of the proposed search algorithm
under different level of utilization rate (i.e.,
∑
ρi) and different level of the
number of items. We randomly generate 20 instances for four different level
of utilization rate which range from 0.6 to 0.8 also five different level of the
number of items from 5 to 25.
In this random experiment, we employee the average total cost TC(mLB , TLB)
as a cost upper bound (denoted as TCUB) which the cycle time is used from
the TLB in (4.1). The TLB represents the minimize cycle time for the objective
function guarantee to get a feasible solution. We have the first derivative of
TCi(mi, TLB) with respect to mi which get the
mLBi = diTLB
√
αi(pii + ri)/2, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. mLBi is the optimal number of
inspection for item i under TLB . As we obtain the values of two variables TLB
and mLB , then we can calculate the upper bound TCUB as follows.
TCUB(mLB , TLB) =

(5.1)
The TCUB is the cost value of an easy and feasible solution can serve as an
upper bound on the optimal objective function value. Denote TC∗ as the
optimal objective function value obtained from the proposed search algorithm
for a particular instance. Then, we may calculate the value of ∆ in eq. (5.2) to
measure the deviation of the objective function value of the solution obtained
22
for the other lot sizing problems with considering inspection work in their
decision-making scenario. Second, in the literature, this proposed model is
among the pioneer works that considers the production lot sizing problem with
inspection for multiple items (Please refer to section 1.3 for details.). Third,
the computational experiments indicate that our proposed search algorithm
and the upper bound can be useful tools to obtain the optimal feasible solution
for production managers in their decision scenario.
There exists plenty of room for this study’s extensions. Some recommenda-
tions for further research including to extend the work to the extended basic
period (EBP) solution approach that always can get better solutions than the
CC approach as shown in the literature. An additional line of investigation
could be to incorporate stochastic demand and consumption rate that proved
to be of value in the case of the classical ELSP. Also, we may apply our search
algorithm to solve other extensions like reworking or pricing. The authors are
currently working on the above topics.

how much willing to pay can be for hospital to the suppliers 
with the constraints of minimizing operating costs to reduce 
the lead time.  
Inventory management of hospital operation can be define 
as providing products for individual segment in hospital at 
the right time, to the right place, in the right quantity and 
condition, making the medical processes go smoothly and 
reduce the operating costs (Guo, 1989). 
The main purposes of this research are as follows: 
1. To establish the optimal purchasing strategy of Veterans 
General Hospital with systematic and efficiency method. 
2. Allocating the resource reasonably to save unnecessary 
expenditure. 
3. Using mathematical model to understand and control the 
shortages.  
4. Classify the pharmaceutical items by various 
characteristic and establish different inventory 
implementation strategies.  
5. To improve the service level by cost reduction and 
strengthen inventory management. 
6. Reducing the human factors involved and deciding the 
optimal reorder points and purchase quantity to reduce the 
inventory costs. 
 
2. Literature review 
 
2.1 Pharmaceutical items classification 
 
Ron et al.(1976) applied ABC classification and economic 
order quantity (EOQ) to analyze medical purchasing. The 
study classifies the annual pharmaceutical items into three 
categories: A, B and C, respectively. ABC classification is 
first defined by Villefredo Pareto(1879). The items are 
classified into three levels according to they priority. The 
items in the A category are with less quantity but large 
amount of money. Category C includes items with large 
quantity but less amount of money. Items with specific 
proportion between category A and C are category B. The 
method is applied effectively under the constraint of limited 
labor and time to manage different items with various 
control strategy.  
Prior studies of pharmaceutical items control and 
management generally suggested hospitals to do ABC 
analysis for the pharmaceutical items and implement 
management focus on category A and B that are important 
and large proportion of capacity. By using the EOQ model, 
the inventory cost can be reduced and increase the inventory 
turnover rate when planning the replenishment batch size 
and reorder points (Lin, 1994; Lu, 1994; Su et al., 1997). 
However, these studies ignored the specific characteristics of 
medical system. In this study, we enhance the category items 
considered with medical specific characteristics. Medication 
are categorized into five different categories, which is 
category A, static, first aid, seasonal and long term lead time, 
respectively. 
Some studies have discussed the ordinary items category 
considered with supply chain characteristics. Cheng (2002) 
defined multiple items management as the various business 
transaction behaviors between customers and suppliers. 
Suppliers can deliver different kinds of items to the 
customers at the same time according to the customer 
demand. Van Eijs et al. (1992) reviews related studies and 
suggest that classification strategy can be classified into 
indirect grouping and direct grouping strategies. In this 
study, however, we do not consider these two strategies 
because the pharmacy purchasing policy and medication 
characteristic are different from ordinary material items. 
Most studies about pharmaceutical items management use 
ABC classification method but only classify items without a 
clear consideration of control model. However, the ABC 
classification method seems not satisfies the whole scenarios. 
As a result, we classify the medication into five different 
categories, which is category A, static, first aid, seasonal and 
long term lead time, respectively. 
 
2.2 Inventory control 
 
The purpose of inventory management is to balance the 
inventory quantity and purchasing frequency to hold the 
appropriate inventory and to use the funds reasonably in 
order to raise the production rates and revenue (Business 
Strategy, 1988). Lai (1991) proposed that the objective of 
inventory control is minimizing costs within providing 
service that satisfies customer demand. However, supplier 
usually increase the inventory cost to improve the service 
level and increase the costs. Therefore, the decision-making 
of inventory quantity level become an important issue of 
inventory management, including the decision-making of 
order quantity, time to purchase and the technique of 
controlling inventory cost. William (1999) points out the 
essential conditions of effective inventory control are as 
follows. 
1. An information system that is able to track the holding 
inventory and inventory under purchasing process. 
2. Reliable demand forecasting including possible forecast 
error. 
3. Knowledge of lead time and lead-time variability. 
4. Estimated values of reasonable inventory holding cost, 
ordering cost and shortage cost. 
5. Classification system of inventory system.  
 
The optimal inventory management is managed through 
inventory planning and control method application, such as 
economic order quantity (EOQ), material requirements 
planning (MRP), MRP II, newsboy model and just-in-time 
purchasing et al. (Lai, 1991). Usually, more complex the 
implementing inventory strategy is, the more accurate is the 
managed inventory system, however, the time required and 
cost are relatively higher. Inventory quantity control has 
direct influence to the cost. The following presents different 
inventory control model under various assumptions and 
with maximizing total profit. Lin & Kroll (1997) propose 
pairs of performance criteria under the newsboy model, the 
so-called pairs of performance criteria means a target profit 
must be greater than expected level of a particular subject, 
bringing the total expected profit is maximized. In their 
study, the mathematical model is constructed with 
restrictions and conditions. Its decision-making variable is 
the ordering quantity. Ishii and Nose (1996) consider two 
different kinds of customer to provide different levels of 
perishable goods and set different prices. They further 
consider the restrictions of the warehouse capacity and 
available for the rented warehouse to construct the expected 
total profit function. The optimal ordering strategy is made 
by   optimal theory. The demand is random variable and the 
shortage situation is allowed. Khouja (1995) constructs 
multiple sales discount newsboy model which includes the 
total expected cost model and further proof the function is a 
convex function which exists optimal solutions. The 
decision variable is ordering quantity. The optimal ordering 
strategy for maximizing the profit is proposed. In this study, 
we use the multi-period newsboy model (Nahmias, 1993) to 
have an in-depth discussion. 
For the seasonal medicine, the consumption of medicine 
can differ from seasons and mouths. There are some rules 
can be followed to analyze the influences of seasons and 
predict the time for decision-making. To solve the ordering 
problem in a limit period, Schwarz (1972) proposed that 
ordering amount should be adjusted to integers during the 
limit period to avoid the surpass inventory or the shortage. 
There are many reviews discuss about the seasonal demand, 
such as Silver(1979) discuss the time trend model of demand, 
Teng(1996) discuss the deterministic demand time linear 
model and Lin (2004) adjusts the EOQ model to meet the 
seasonal trend. To predict the seasonal trend, time series 
analysis method including the moving average method, 
regression analysis and ARIMA models and neural networks 
are often used. In this study, we use variation coefficients to 
do the judgment and further use the twice of the standard 
deviation as a range to examine whether the monthly target 
excess the range. For level A medicine, the decision-making 
is made by adjusting the (Q, R) value. On the other hand, the 
adjustment of stable medicine is to change the (s, S) value. 
Zhou (2002) applies neural networks in a multi-product 
demand forecast and simulation of a six-month short-term 
order, collecting orders for type, arrival time, quantity, etc. 
They use BPN neural network to build the demand 
forecasting model. The major input and output variables 
include interval of arrival time, number of products, order 
types of weights. Mean square error (MSE) is referred as the 
evaluation indicators. The results shows that when using of 
BPN neural network demand forecasting model, the average 
MSE values of the test samples are below 0.15. In this study, 
we concern that how to forecast the future trends in multi-
product under demand uncertainty. 
The major work of discussing seasonal demand is to find 
the time when change occur, and that is the reason why the 
forecast should be made. The forecast method of pharmacy 
is similar to general material, as a result, the aforementioned 
reference have already provided effective forecasting tools. 
After forecasting, the seasonal inventory control is made. 
Although the models related to inventory control is 
discussed above, it is noticed that there are lack applications 
of reference about medical industry, especially the medical 
management. In sum, we refer to the forecasting method and 
management for general material, using variance parameters 
and standard deviation to select the seasonal demand and 
further establish a seasonal pharmacy inventory management 
model that is suitable for pharmacy department. 
 
2.3 Some gap in the literature 
 
There are two types of general inventory classification. One 
is the ABC classification method which classifies items into 
type A, B, and C respectively. The management and control 
are different from individual type. The other method is the 
heuristic classification method which considers the objective 
as minimizing the joint replenishment cost. In this study, we 
have less discussion on the supply chain but simplify the 
problem with classification of medical department 
management. As a result, the heuristic classification method 
with consideration of minimizing the joint replenishment 
cost is not appropriate for this study. 
For the above discussion, we consider that there are still 
some problems needed to be solved. First of all, does the 
classification method consider the medical characteristic? 
Do we have to set constrains for some specific conditions 
such as high value product or long term lead time product? 
Second, there are few studies for the pharmacy inventory 
control which applies the inventory model. Also, the 
assumption and study method are too simple. The 
characteristic of medicine is different from other products. 
The variety and control difficulty caused the reason that the 
single inventory method can not be applied for whole 
pharmaceutical items. The study results of foreign studies 
seem not so appropriate because of the different regulation 
and law. As a result, we consider different inventory control 
systems for medical characteristic and habit. Third, in this 
study, we consider the specific seasonal medicine which has 
large difference with the study of ordinary seasonal 
problems. We further emphasis the adjustment for seasonal 
medicine.  
 
3. The Proposed Methodology 
 
Our purpose in this study is aimed the managers to find the 
appropriate decision method for medicine of individual 
category. Four steps are included in this study and shown as 
Figure 1. 
1. There are two kinds of the current purchasing procedure: 
contract medicine purchasing and project medicine 
purchasing. The purchasing process of project medicine 
required under the law and the procedures can not be 
simplified. As a result, it is temporarily altered. However, 
the purchasing process for contract medicine can be 
reviewed from the reorder frequency and the delivery 
ways for ordering. The control of frequency of medicine 
purchasing and purchasing amount are based on ABC 
classification analysis. The ratio of each level of the total 
purchase amount as follows: level A is about 65%, level 
B is about 20%, level C is about 5%, and level D is about 
10%. In this study, we focus on re-planning the 
classification and make it more suitable for the status. 
2. The medicine supply analysis:  
Delivery deadline: the delivery process of medicine should 
be completed within a week according to the contract.  
Delivery status: apart from a few exceptions, most suppliers 
should be willing to provide priority shipments when 
receiving orders.  
Exceptions: it takes more than six weeks since the 
application starts till the delivery procedure is finished. 
3. Planned inventory: For the medicine with cyclical 
changes in consumption, the planned inventory can make 
a timely advance to adjust purchases amount. The 
purchasing process will be suspended during holidays or 
the period of annual contracts conversion. As a result, 
medicine must be prepared in advance, and the proportion 
is estimated by experience. 
Problem: 
Project imported medicine, such as SYPRINE with BCNU 
are imported by suppliers after the order is made. The reason 
why suppliers do not prepare inventory is that the 
regulations from Department of Health. As for the rare 
disease medication, the patients have no other alternative 
medicine. Although the hospital can provide sufficient 
quantities for patients regardless of the cost of medicine, the 
user might only be one or two person. Once if the patient is 
no longer using treatment (which may be transferred or died), 
the remaining drug can not be switched over to use and end 
up in become overdue and useless. 
1. No consumption of new medicine information can be 
found except the estimated consumption quantity 
provided by physicians. In the initial period, the 
purchasing procedure is controlled by lessen standard and 
then taken over by the system during stabilization period.  
Solution: establishing a mechanism to judge the properties 
of the medicine by the short-term consumption of 
information and provide relevant decision-making to the 
users. 
2. Planned inventories: estimating the increasing proportion 
from experience but often does not match with the current 
situation. 
Solution: a better solution would be adjusted according to 
the information in the system. 
 
Step 3: Categorize 
 
To redefine the ABC analysis method, the way of 
classification must be considered. With the present 
experience, level A needs to be further subdivided into high-
priced and long-lead time. The purchase order of level A is 
produced three times a week, reducing the waiting time for 
the medicine. Somehow these high value medicines might 
have large numder of purchasing or small quantity which 
can not be allocated to the pharmacy, while others are within 
extra long lead-time. To maintain the frequency of the 
original purchase and slightly raised the order quantity so 
that all pharmacies can be assigned to a reasonable amount 
of stock. By doing so, it is more able to meet the actual 
operation. The original B2 medicine (currently only 20) 
should be merged into the C level. Furthermore, B1 and B2 
category can be combined with level B. The general 
classification criteria are present as Table 2 
 
Table 2 Criteria of ABC Classification 
Level Criteria of Classification Importance 
A Long lead time, high product 
unit value 
Very 
important 
B Appropriate lead time,  Ordinary 
C Fair or lower material value Less 
important 
 
Usually, the items with long lead time and high value are 
classified to level A. In this study, the classification is 
according to the annual cost. Our major concern is the level 
A medicine and further discuss the medicine with long lead-
time. Level B & C medicine are classified into stable 
medicine and seasonal medicine while making particular the 
classification and control for emergency medicine 
 
Step 4: Optimal purchasing strategy analysis 
 
In step 4, we consider the optimal purchasing strategy and 
policy of level A medicine, stable medicine, rescue medicine, 
seasonal medicine and long-term lead time medicine, 
respectively, to improve the replenishment system of the 
hospital effectively. 
The (Q,R) model is applied for the strategy of level A 
medicine because of its reorder point and lot size are 
independent variables. In addition, the characteristic of level 
A medicine is that the lead time is longer or the price of 
material is higher. We consider its possibility of shortage 
and the shortage cost. Under such circumstance, the 
pharmacy department would no longer report the sale price 
based on the past because it is related to the cost when the 
shortage occur such as overtime costs, direct labor work 
overtime, indirect labor, indirect costs. These costs must be 
reconsidered to reduce the cost of hospital. 
For the medicine which has stable demand, the (s,S) 
replenishment strategy of periodic review systems is applied 
due to the high value of level B medicine. Therefore, 
implemented and the shortage situations would be controlled 
in an acceptable range. 
Seasonal drugs need to be adjusted for the safety stock 
and ordering quantity in specific month. The judge methods 
is find the coefficient with high variability, and further use 
of the past five years average value and standard deviation 
data to identify the month with special high or low demand. 
The commonly used strategy is by using (s, S) model, 
however, the (Q, R) model is applied for level A medicine 
and adjusts over time. We also use time series of methods to 
make predictions, identifing the timing point to change and 
adjusting the (s, S) or (Q, R) strategy. The most common 
ways to predict the seasonal changes are simple average 
method and the moving average method. 
Long lead-time will normally be classified as level A. In 
this study, we will discuss it independently, using different 
models to do calculations, looking forward to get better 
results. For the long lead-time medicine, the shortages of 
medicines cause the result that it is impossible to have a 
further replenishment. Furthermore, it may cause some 
inconvenience on management if the medicines do not run 
out while replenshing new ones. This type of medicine will 
be able to increase efficiency if it is viewed as a single cycle. 
As a result, we apply the newsboy model proposed by 
Nahmias (1993) and extend to multi-period newsboy model. 
 
4. Result 
 
4.1 Classification 
 
In the original classification, the hospital is divided into five 
categories. The hospital controls the purchasing frequency 
and volume of procurement according to ABC classification. 
Each type of proportion of total purchasing cost and total 
items are as follows: level A is approximately 65% of the 
amount of cost and 16% of total items, level B is 
approximately 20% of the amount of cost and 40% of total 
items, level C is approximately 5% of the amount of cost 
and 23% of total items, level D is approximately 10% of the 
amount of cost and 21% of total items. Hospital category is 
divided into five categories, including medicine and 
emergency medicine, somehow the consideration is not 
enough for the actual situations, causing non-effectively 
control of the characteristics for different medicine. Some of 
the artificial adjusted related to the experience, are often 
cause miscarriage of justice results. In this study, we 
propose a standard classification procedure, using the 
concept of the use of cost-year to do ABC classification. 
Additional analysis and adjustment is made for medicine 
with special attributes. Visual Basic and Access database is 
used to update the information in the hospital and provide 
suggestion in quick response.  
Annual cost concept is used in ABC classification 
deriving from an annual average usage multiplied by the 
average purchase price. Figure 3 shows the classification 
according to the item amount of annual cost. Level A 
medicine is 70% of accumulation annual cost and 16% of 
the total amount of items. Level B is 20% of accumulation 
annual cost and 21% of the total amount of items. Level C is 
10% of accumulation annual cost and 63% of the total 
amount of items. 
By the above classification, the comparison of the original 
and the new classification is shown in Table 3. By using the 
new classification method, the items of level B decreased 
from 400 to 205, while level C increased to 622. Only 
45.68% of the items remain the same with the original 
classification.

4.2 Inventory Control 
 
There are two major works of inventory controlling: one is 
to establish a management system to derive the quantity and 
value of inventory. The other is to make the decision that 
when to buy products and the purchasing quantity. 
The inventory model includes four parts of the costs. The 
cost items are defined as follows. 
1. Product cost: generally, the cost is derived from the 
material unit price products annual demand. As a result, 
when the supplier provides quantity discount, the cost is 
considered as an important component. A large number 
of purchases will reduce unit costs. Unless there are 
principle of the methods are all the same. Therefore, we 
compound the original policy and the new model by using 
programming to compute and compare the difference 
between its cost saving.  
Under this parameter setting, the medicine has a total 
savings of over $500 thousands and the saving percentage is 
60.04%. Because of the real-time monitoring of (Q, R) 
model, the cost savings and control will be more effective. 
By using the existing data of warehouse systems, the real-
time monitoring can be applied to get the real-time 
information. 
 
Stable medicine - (s, S) model 
 
This type of medicine includes about 600 items. Due to 
steady demand for the medicine, we use the (s,S) model for 
regular inventory. The (s, S) model is that when the 
inventory is below the s-point and then ordered the amount 
of S. Because of its complexity of operation, this model can 
not be well applied in practical to. We establish a 
mechanism to facilitate the operation of the program to 
provide a precise calculation and replenishment strategies 
for the hospital. We select a comparably convenient and 
effective method of operation in thirteen kinds of (s, S) 
method. Under this parameter adjustment, the cost savings 
of medicine is almost $2.5 million with 76.22% saving 
percentage. Because of its large amount of items, the costs 
of these items accounted for almost half of all medicine. 
Although the amount of saving cost, most savings come 
from a small number of items. 
 
Emergency medicine- a strict standard of service control 
 
The shortage of emergency medicine will endanger the 
safety of patients. Therefore, the shortage should be avoided. 
In our previous calculation, the service level is set as 98% 
and we raised the service level to 99.9% for these items. The 
shortage probability is only one-thousandth. The shortage 
cost of medicine is higher than others. The items are 
identified by the additional service level and to check that 
whether it is level A medicine. If the items are level A 
medicine, we use (Q, R) model to compute by increasing the 
service level. If the items are not level A medicine, we use (s, 
S) inventory management strategies to compute by 
increasing service level. By this way, we increase the 
accuracy of emergency medicine in order to achieve the dual 
effect that can suitable for the characteristics of medicine 
and can also control the shortages occurrence.  
For these items, when increasing the service level, the 
amount of inventory will rise, thus, the ratio of saving cost 
should be less than other types of medicine. The saving cost 
is more than $71,000 with 51.57% savings rate. The result is 
caused by the serious shortage occurred in current status. 
Furthermore, the shortage costs of these items are higher 
than the general medicine, resulting in high cost for hospital. 
As a result, the improvement ratio is significant even though 
we increase the service level. A survey which confirmed the 
importance of these items are made in various clinical 
subjects including gynecology, thoracic surgery, 
neurosurgery, dermatology, ENT, infection Branch, 
obstetrics, gastroenterology, radiation oncology, 
Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Department. 
Seasonal medicine- (s, S) or (Q, R) adjustment for a 
particular month 
Demand for consumption of certain medicine has a 
specific trend, or centralize in particular months. For such 
items, we first choose the items with high coefficient of 
variation, and then identify the monthly higher or lower 
demand from the past five years the average and standard 
deviation. After the preliminary seasonal analysis, we select 
items with significant seasonal trends in particular month 
and increased or decreased the order quantity and safety 
stock. We do not to consider the results of ABC 
classification when the items are classified as seasonal 
medicine. The cost savings of seasonal medicine is about 
$24,000 and saving percentage is 65.97%. Take GRISEN 
TAB 500MG as an example, the item should be adjusted 
upward in July and August and be adjusted downward in 
February. Figure 5 shows the average monthly amount in the 
past five years. The results are consistent with the trend. 
 
 
Figure 5 Average monthly amount of GRISEN TAB 500MG 
 
Consider whether the medicine is seasonal or not, we first 
analyze the results and further made the questionnaire. The 
survey is made in various clinical subjects including 
gynecology and thoracic surgery, neurosurgery, dermatology, 
ENT, infection Branch, obstetrics, gastroenterology, 
radiation oncology, Hematology and Oncology, Children's 
Medical Division to confirm the seasonal medicine which 
must be adjust in different seasons. 
Long term lead-time medicine- multi-period newsboy 
model 
There are 30 items that their lead time is more than 1 month 
and the percentage of total amount is 2.238%. The cost of 
individual item is compute and compare to others to find the 
lead time which can save most cost. Because of the 
specificity of long lead-time, it cost more than one month to 
receive the medicine after issuing the order. We except that 
the ordering amount of medicine will consumed just before 
the lead-time point to avoid the replenishment problem. For 
such characteristics, we use a multi-period newsboy model 
to effectively control this problem. By applying this model,

5. Conclusion  
 
In the competitive environment of medical industry, how to 
effectively reduce the hospital cost and increase service 
quality and competitiveness has become an important issue 
for medical industry. In this study, we consider various 
medicine and different medical characteristic and analyze 
with ABC classification and demand on the basis of 
inventory management of pharmacy department. The 
purchasing strategies are further selected to improve the 
operation of pharmacy department and establish a decision-
making mechanism to avoid the human factor intervention. 
We establish (Q, R) and (s, S) inventory management model 
to construct service level and adjust according to medical 
characteristic. The final result shows a saving of about 3 
million of the total cost. After analyzing the cost structure, 
we find out that most of saving sources come from the 
inventory holding cost and shortage cost. The result help the 
hospital to avoid the waste and the hospital does not have 
additional labors. By analyzing the framework of medical 
industry, we use the appropriate inventory model to 
construct the evaluation mechanisms and programming 
system to improve the efficiency and reducing cost of the 
hospital.  
We use Visual Basic and Access database as the compute 
basis. To update the data, we can derive the new decision-
making by updating the content of database. However, to 
operate a completely electrical system, it is necessary to 
combine the programming of this study and the real data of 
information technology department in the hospital. The 
current result can not be testified because of the problem in 
information technology department. We suggest that the 
hospital to establish a link between the programming and 
real database to improve the efficiency in the future.
