Abstract 
 hMYH, a putative human E. coli MutY homology, can effectively remove adenine opposite to 
GO or G in duplex oligonucleotides with its glycosylase and AP lyase activities. Its germline 
mutations have been reported to be associated with colorectal cancer in Caucasian population. In 
this study, we employed modified the allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) to 
analysis the mutations in hMYH. At first, we utilized the plasmid DNA containing hMYH as the 
DNA template to establish the optimum AS-PCR conditions. Previously, we have investigated the 
effects of DNA template concentration, annealing temperature, as well as imbalanced dNTP on the 
reliability and sensitivity of AS-PCR. Here, we further explored the effect of various modifications 
at the 3’ terminal of the primers on the efficiency of AS-PCR. We also applied the established 
AS-PCR condition to examine the hMYH mutations in human non-small cell lung cancer cells. Our 
preliminary results indicated no obvious mutations of hMYH at G382D, Y165C, and V232F 
hot-spots. However, we found that the sequence between exon 15~16 exhibited different structures 
from that published by GeneBank, which was identified as the Alu repeated sequence. Since the Alu 
sequences has also been implicated in several inherited human diseases, including various forms of 
cancer. Our results may suggest the possible connection between the abnormal Alu sequence and 
the lost of hMYH activity, in which leads to the cell transformation and cancer predisposition. 
Therefore, the preliminary results bring us a new direction on the study of the correlation between 
hMYH and the NSCLC formation.

Introduction 
  More evidences have been indicated that smoking increases the accumulation of free radicals, 
reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNS and ROS, respectively) [Traber et al., 2000; 
Thaiparambil et al., 2007], in which is largely because, after combustion, the cigarette can produce 
nicotine, tar, carbon dioxide, and other nearly 4,000 chemicals, among them 53 chemicals have 
been confirmed as carcinogens [Jenkins and Guerin 1984; Ding et al., 2007]. Cellular DNA damage 
induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has also been implicated in genetic instability, aging, and 
cancer development [Ames, 1993]. On the other hand, DNA repair acts as an essential line of 
defense against the damage to DNA and reduces the incidence of cancer or inherited diseases. 
Among the variety of DNA adducts caused by ROS, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (or 8-oxoG) is 
 6
On the other hand, the tumors from patients with recessive inheritance of multiple colorectal 
adenomas displayed excess somatic transversions of a G:CÆT:A in the adenomatous polyposis 
coli (APC) gene, a tumor suppressor gene. Further studies indicate that two germ-line mutations in 
the base-excision-repair gene hMYH, such as Y165C and G382D, are found to be associated with 
colorectal adenomas [Livingston et. al, 2005]. Furthermore, the missense mutations (R227W and 
V232F) of hMYH that lie within the putative hMSH6 binding domain have been characterized, in 
which hMYH(R227W) has a severe defect in A/8-oxoG binding and glycosylase activities, while 
hMYH(V232F) has reduced A/8-oxoG binding and glycosylase activities [Bai et. al, 2005].  
 
So far, no such investigation has been carefully clarified in human lung cancer cells. In this 
study, we investigated the mutations of hMYH at its hot-spot. Based on the result, we expect to 
conclude the possible contribution of hMYH mutations to NSCLC, thereby establishing more 
promise prognosis method and improving the survival rate of NSCLC patients in Taiwan.   
 
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful molecular biology technique to amplify DNA 
in vitro. It has been widely applied to a broad variety of applications in modern biotechnology. 
Previously, we have employed AS-PCR to detect the specific mutation at the codon 61 of the 
H-ras in rats and assessed the risk of aristolochic acid to Chinese herbs nephropathy and urothelial 
tumors [Cheng et al. 2006] as well as the potential mutations of hMYH in human colorectal cancer 
tissues. In this study, we investigated that alternative AS-PCR by modifying the 3’-terminal of 
primer in order to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the AS-PCR. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Plasmid DNA preparation 
 The plasmid DNA containing hMYH gene was previously constructed by inserting the hMYH 
gene into a pET 21a vector (Gu et al., 2002). Mutation of AÆC at the sixth nucleotide from the 
ORF of hMYH cDNA was then introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. All plasmid DNAs were 
purified with Qiagen mini-prep, and then quantified by UV spectrometer as well as agarose gel 
electrophoresis. The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  The genomic DNAs of 
NSCLC cancer cell lines were prepared as previously reported by Qiagen kit (Gu and Lu, 2001). 
  
Allele- specific PCR (AS-PCR) 
 The primers used to amplify the hMYH fragments containing G382, , Y165C, V232F, R227W, 
and others were designed according to the sequence of hMYH gene (Gene bank GI:13112008). The 
strategy for the detection of single nucleotide mutation by AS-PCR was illustrated in Scheme 1. 
For a DNA template containing either no mutation or single mutation, both wild-type specific 
primer and mutant specific primer were employed for PCR reaction. While using the wild-type 
specific primer, there was a mutation opposite to the 3' terminal of the primer in the DNA template 
if no noticeable PCR product was obtained; otherwise, there was no mutation in the DNA template. 
On the other hand, while using the mutant specific primer, there was a mutation opposite to the 3' 
terminal of the primer in the DNA template if noticeable PCR product was obtained; otherwise,

Figure 2. The effect of 3’-teminal mismatch on the sensitivity of SNP detection. The 
Lane M is DNA marker, with the same forward primer, the backward primers in lanes 1 and 
2 contains double mismatches at their 3’ terminal with DNA template, whereas those in 
lanes 3 and 4 contains single mismatch with DNA template. The annealing temperature is 
57.4 oC. 
  
3.2 The effect of modifications at 3’ terminal of primers on the on AS-PCR 
 On the other hand, the extension of daughter strand DNA during amplification can be stopped 
by a 3’-terminal modification, such as phosphate and aminoC6 groups, shown in Scheme 1. In order 
to determine whether the template containing mismatch or not, a DNA polymerase with fine 5Æ3 
mismatch repair activity should be utilized. In this study, we examined two DNA polymerase and 
two 3’-terminal modifications. As shown in Figure 3, pfu was unable to effectively remove the 
mismatched terminal that was modified by a phosphate group in order to initialize the DNA 
polymerization. Similarly, vent+ could not remove the mismatched terminal that was modified by 
both phosphate and aminoC6 groups, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The reason for these 
results should be further investigated.

modified 3’-terminal and are wild- or mutant-primers, respectively. The annealing 
temperature is 57.4 oC and pfu is employed.

controlling the gene expression of hMYH as well as the repair activity of hMYH. The detail 
influence of Alu on hMYH activity and its potential in NSCLC development will be further 
characterized.

Conclusion 
 In this study, we have further investigated the parameters that may influence the efficiency of 
AS-PCR, and we found that the introduction of mismatches (two or three) at the 3’ terminal of 
primer might dramatically improve the sensitivity and specificity of AS-PCR in order to distinguish 
the mutations in the template. Theoretically, the modification at the 3’ terminal of primer with 
phosphate and aminoC6 groups might also be able to improve the performance of AS-PCR, however, 
we did not obtain the verification by using DNA polymerase pfu and vent+, the detail of the 
consequence will be further investigated. By using the established condition, we have characterized 
the genomic DNA from several NSCLC cell lines for mutations of hMYH, our results indicated the 
similar conclusion that has been found for the genomic DNA from colorectal cancer patients from 
Taiwan, in which no obvious mutations, such as G382D, Y165C, and V232F. However, we have 
interestingly found an abnormal sequence structure between the exons 15 and 16, which NSCLC 
cells contained an extra Alu fragment in the existed Alu sequence and a GC-rich fragment was 
identified. By comparison, there was only one Alu sequence in that region according to the gene 
bank. Whether the irregular Alu structure contributes to the defectiveness of hMYH repair activity 
as well as be predisposed to NSCLC will be investigated in the future.
