ABSTRACT
Image reconstruction from limited number of
sampled data typically leads to infinitely many
data-consistent solutions, and it is usually difficult
to specify an accurate image even in the absence
of noise. One solution to this non-uniqueness
problem is to incorporate prior knowledge into the
estimation procedure, and the prior discrete Fourier
transform (PDFT) algorithm is a good example
based on this aspect. The PDFT promisingly
provides a high-quality solution by solving the
best approximation in a designed Hilbert space as
the image estimate, while its computational cost
with large data sets is unfavorable. In our previous
research achievements, the implementation of the
iterative algebraic reconstruction techniques (ART)
into the PDFT successfully improves computational
efficiency significantly, without degrading the
image quality. In this research project, taking a
further step towards extending our research scope,
some other well-known iterative algorithms were
implemented in the PDFT and their performances
were investigated, in order for pursuing a better
applicability of the PDFT with large data sets.
Keywords: image reconstruction, non-uniqueness
problem, prior discrete Fourier transform, algebraic
reconstruction techniques.
1. REASON AND OBJECTIVE
In image reconstruction, the degradation of the im-
age formation due to incomplete data set is typically
inevitable. For example, synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) [1,2] imaging systems take advantage of
long-range propagation characteristics of radar sig-
nals and the complex information processing capa-
bility of modern digital electronics to provide high-
resolution imagery, but the image blurring problem
typically exists. In SAR imagery, the reflected radar
signals are received from the target over a range of
viewing angle and with different frequencies. For
practical issues, some physical limitations confine
the viewing angle and/or the frequency range, and
3where an appropriate value of γ can be taken for
faster convergence.
2.3 The block-iterative algebraic reconstruction
technique (BIART)
Instead of updating the estimate x after each I itera-
tive steps in the SART, the BIART can operate more
flexibly by partitioning I data values into several
blocks (subsets). Suppose that, with N blocks in
b = Ax, 
b1
b2
...
bN
 =

A1
A2
...
AN
x ,
where An is In× J matrix and bn is In× 1 vector.
The iterative step is given by [20]
xk+1 = xk +
S−1n A
H
n (bn −Anxk)
In
, (7)
in which n = mod(k,N) + 1 and In is the number
of elements in bn. Sn is the diagonal matrix having
the entries
∑J
m=1 |(An)im|2.
The rescaled block-iterative algebraic reconstruc-
tion technique (RBIART) is the same as the BIART
except that In is replaced by γ−1n .
xk+1 = xk + γnS
−1
n A
H
n (bn −Anxk) . (8)
2.4 The multiplicative algebraic reconstruction
technique (MART)
The MART can be applied to solve for x in the
matrix equation b = Ax, if the entries of b, A
and x are positive, nonnegative and nonnegative
respectively. Beginning the initial positive vector x0,
the iterative step is [11]
xk+1j = x
k
j
[
bi
(Axk)i
]γi(S−1)iiAij/mi
, (9)
where i = mod(k, I) + 1 and mi = max{Aij|j =
1, 2, . . . , J}.
2.5 The simultaneous multiplicative algebraic
reconstruction technique (SMART)
The SMART is the same as the MART, but updates
the estimate after each I iterative steps. The iterative
step is [21]–[23]
xk+1j = x
k
j
I∏
i=1
[
bi
(Axk)i
]γi(S−1)iiAij/mi
, (10)
here i = mod(k, I) + 1.
2.6 The expectation maximization maximum
likelihood (EMML) method
The EMML can be applied to solve for x in the
matrix equation b = Ax, if the entries of b, A
and x are positive, nonnegative and nonnegative
respectively. Beginning the initial positive vector x0,
the iterative step is [24], [25]
xk+1j = x
k
jσ
−1
j
I∑
i=1
(S−1)iiAij
bi
(Axk)i
, (11)
where i = mod(k, I) + 1.
2.7 The Jacobi method
The Jacobi method can be applied to solve for x in
the matrix equation b = Ax, if A is square and its
diagonal entries are nonzero. Beginning the initial
vector x0, the iterative step is
xk+1 = D−1(b−Axk +Dxk) , (12)
where D is the diagonal matrix with the entries Aii.
The Jacobi over-relaxation (JOR) method is the
adapted form of the Jacobi method, with a relaxation
parameter ω in the splitting scale.
xk+1 = ωD−1(b−Axk + ωDxk) , (13)
where 0 < ω ≤ 1.
2.8 The Gauss-Siedel method
The Gauss-Seidel method can be applied to solve
for x in the matrix equation b = Ax, if A is square
and its diagonal entries are nonzero. Beginning the
initial vector x0, the iterative step is
xk+1j =
bj − (Axk)j +Ajjxkj
Ajj
, (14)
where j = mod(k, I) + 1.
53.7 The iterative PDFT by the Jacobi method,
JOR, Gauss-Siedel method or SOR
Since the Jacobi method, JOR, Gauss-Siedel
method, or SOR is only appropriate for solving
the square system of equations, based on the first
scheme, it solves for a in d = Pa by Eqn. (12), Eqn.
(13), Eqn. (14), or Eqn. (15), and then substitutes aˆ
into Eqn. (3).

4. SIMULATIONS
To our interests and performance evaluations under
different applications, simulated SAR and comput-
erized tomography (CT) data values were used to
demonstrate the image reconstructions using our
newly-developed algorithms. The object function to
be reconstructed and the prior function used for
all the iterative PDFT methods are in shown in
Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b), respectively. Sampled data
value in SAR imagery is mathematically interpreted
as the Fourier transformation from the character-
istic distribution function of the target, while the
radon transformation is the mathematical represen-
tation for the connection between the data value
and the characteristic distribution function of the
scanned object in CT imagery. Only the iterative
PDFT schemes by the SART, Landweber, BIART,
RBIART, Jacobi, JOR, Gauss-Seidel and SOR meth-
ods are demonstrated for SAR imaging simulations
since the MART, SMART and EMML require that
the entries of the system of equations must be
nonnegative or positive, while all the iterative PDFT
methods can function with the CT simulated data.
The SART, Landweber, BIART and RBIART
are the estimation methods theoretically based on
orthogonal projection on a hyperplane (one equation
in the system) at each iterative step, while taking

because of much poor computational efficiency.
5. CONCLUSIONS
New mathematical formulations of the PDFT in the
iterative form, embedded with the SART, Landwe-
ber, BIART, MART, SMART, EMML, Jacobi,
Gauss-Seidel and CG methods, have been developed
successfully and the rudimentary evaluations to
their performance were achieved. In particulr, SAR
and CT Simulated data were used to demonstrate
and evaluate the image reconstructions. Under the
achievements of this research project, it essentially
encourages the exploration of a better applicability
of the PDFT with large data sets. It remains a topic
for future research, to study the effects of noise
from real measured data, in order for adapting its
applicability more realistic.
6. EVALUATION OF ACHIEVEMENTS
This research project primarily concentrates on the
implementation of iterative schemes into the PDFT.
According to our successful research achievements
with the ART, taking a further step towards ex-
tending our research scope, the iterative SART,
Landweber, BIART, MART, SMART, EMML, Ja-
cobi, Gauss-Seidel and CG methods are in particular
considered for the incorporation of prior knowl-
edge in the sense of PDFT. New prior-knowledge-
based mathematical formulations embedded with
iterative techniques were successfully developed,
and the rudimentary studies to their performance
were achieved with simulated data in SAR and CT
imagery.
While the major accomplishments of this research
project is the newly-developed iterative PDFT-based
algorithms and their performance evaluations, it
extensively explores the field of numerical iterative
methods and earns a better understanding to the
use of prior knowledge in iterative methods. All
the research outcomes under this project can be
carried into relevant studies, and also encourage
some more advanced research topics. Undergraduate
and graduate students who had participated in this
research project cannot only earn enhanced math-
ematical backgrounds about prior-knowledge-based
algorithms and some well-known iterative methods,
but also train themselves good skills in computer
programming and simulation.
