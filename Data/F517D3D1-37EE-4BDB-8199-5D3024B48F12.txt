ABSTRACT
The purpose of the present work was to
investigate the nanoindentation process by FEM
of bulk materials such as pure copper, titanium,
iron and so on, considering strain hardening
effect of material. In order to verify the FEM
simulation results of the mechanical parameters
such as Young’s modulus, yield stress and
tangent modulus, the experimental data are
compared with the results of the current
simulation. The abductive network was then
applied to synthesize the data sets obtained from
the numerical simulation. The predicted results of
the mechanical properties from the prediction
model are consistent with the results obtained
from experiment. After employing the predictive
model can provide valuable references in
prediction of the mechanical parameters after
nanoindentation tests.

1 INDROTUCTION
Finite element method (FEM) has been
widely used for numerical simulation of
indentation tests on bulk material in order to
analyze its deformation response and investigate
the influence of indenter geometry, friction and
material elastic and plastic properties. Pelletier et.
al [1] have investigated the influence of material
bilinear elastic-plastic behaviour model for
numerical simulation of nanoindentation testing
of various bulk metals. They employed an
axisymmetric rigid cone and equal volume to the
Berkovich pyramid indenter to simulate the test.
The indenter and the specimen were treated as a
revolution body in order to have three-
dimensional situation. The numerical simulation
results of loads verse displacement compare
reasonable well to experimental results of
nanoindentation tests of pure metals as Fe, Ni, Ti
and Cu. In order to determine dimensionless
functions correlating rheological factors with
parameters extracted from loading and unloading
curves, Pelletier [2] used a comprehensive
parametric study of 48 cases was conducted;
elastic modulus ranges from 70 to 430 GPa, yield
stress from 100 to 600 MPa and the tangent
modulus from 3 to 40 GPa. They defined two
dimensionless equations which link the
parameters extracted from the experimental load–
displacement curve with material parameters,
such as Young’s modulus, yield stress and 
tangent modulus. The equations have been tested
with success first on load–displacement curves
simulated with FEM and then on experimental
curves obtained by nanoindentation testing using
a Berkovich tip. Lin [3] predicts the rolling force
and deformation in three-dimensional cold rolling
by using the FEM and neural network. Lin and
Lin [4] used the finite element method in
conjunction with abductive network to investigate
the geometrical shape of the deformation profile

the conical indenter has the same area function as
a Berkovich tip was used in this study. The
contact region of both tip and bulk material were
finely meshed for good simulation accuracy. In
order to confirm the feasibility of the finite
element method, the results published by Pelletier
et. al [1] is used to compare with the present
numerical results by DEFORM-2D software. The
experimental data of Pelletier et. al [1] is
compared with the results of the current
simulation. Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the
comparison between the current simulation and
the results of Pelletier et. al [1]. The loading and
unloading curve predicted by current simulation
show good agreement with the experimental
results of Pelletier et. al [1]. Therefore, the
simulation by DEFORM-2D for nanoindentation
process is reasonable accurate.

3.1 Database Training
The yielding stress is varied between 100-
600 MPa, whereas the other material’s properties
were selected by varying the Young’s modulus,
the tangent modulus and the indentation depth in
the ranges of 72-430 GPa, 3.6-40 GPa and 100-
400 nm, respectively. There are four variables of
material properties, each of which was set at three
levels. Therefore, 81 (3*3*3*3) combinations of
parameters of material’s property are constituted
totally, and theses are shown in Table 1. The
load–displacement curves obtained with FEM
have been analyzed with the same method as the
experimental load–indentation depth curves, as
shown in Fig. 5. The curves corresponding to the
loading part have been fitted using a polynomial
law, P=Ah2+Bh; and the unloading part can be
mathematically described with a polynomial law,
P=Ch2+Dh+F. The loading and unloading curve
can be obtained by the FEM simulation of
indentation process for the different parameters
such as E, Y0, Et and h. The coefficient of
polynomial law such as A, B, C, D, F can be
obtained from the curve fitting skill. Base on the

In this paper, a prediction model has been
established for the E, Y0 and Et by using the finite
element method in conjunction with an abductive
network. The predicted results are consistent with
the results obtained from experiment. After

Finite element method (FEM) has been widely used for
numerical simulation of indentation tests on bulk material
in order to analyze its deformation response and investigate
the influence of indenter geometry, friction and material
elastic and plastic properties. Pelletier et. al [1] have
investigated the influence of material bilinear elastic-plastic

nanoindentation testing of various bulk metals. They
employed an axisymmetric rigid cone and equal volume to
the Berkovich pyramid indenter to simulate the test. The

deformation in three-dimensional cold rolling by using the
FEM and neural network. Lin and Lin [4] used the finite
element method in conjunction with abductive network to
investigate the geometrical shape of the deformation profile
and its related fold defect during forging-extrusion process.
The prediction models are established for radius ratio
estimation of the barrels and fold occurrence situation
judgment under various combinations of process variables.
In order to verify the FEM simulation results of the
mechanical parameters such as Young’s modulus, yield
stress and tangent modulus, the experimental data are
compared with the results of the current simulation. The
abductive network was then applied to synthesize the data

employing the predictive model can provide valuable
references in prediction of the mechanical parameters after
nanoindentation tests.
2 BASIC THEORY
2.1 Finite Element Modeling
A commercial FE code DEFORM-2D [5] is adopted to
analyze the plastic deformation of the nanoindentation
process. For the nanoindentation process of a elastic-plastic
deformation problem, the governing equations for the
solution of the mechanics in plastic deformation for
materials involve equilibrium equations, yield criterion,
constitutive equations and compatibility conditions. The
duality of the boundary value problem and the variation
problem can be seen clearly by considering the construction
of the functional [6]:

3.1 Database Training
The yielding stress is varied between 100-600 MPa,
whereas the other material’s properties were selected by
varying the Young’s modulus, the tangent modulus and the
indentation depth in the ranges of 72-430 GPa, 3.6-40 GPa
and 100-400 nm, respectively. There are four variables of
material properties, each of which was set at three levels.
Therefore, 81 (3*3*3*3) combinations of parameters of
material’s property are constituted totally, and theses are
shown in Table 1. The load–displacement curves obtained
with FEM have been analyzed with the same method as the
experimental load–indentation depth curves, as shown in
Fig. 5. The curves corresponding to the loading part have
been fitted using a polynomial law, P=Ah2+Bh; and the
unloading part can be mathematically described with a
polynomial law, P=Ch2+Dh+F. The loading and unloading
curve can be obtained by the FEM simulation of indentation
process for the different parameters such as E, Y0, Et and h.
The coefficient of polynomial law such as A, B, C, D, F can
be obtained from the curve fitting skill. Base on the training
database regarding the parameters of material’s property
and coefficient of polynomial law such as Y0, E, Et, A, B, C,
D, F, P and h, as shown in Table 1, the abductive networks
with a criterion of minimum square error can be developed
for predicting the E, Y0 and Et under a suitable range of
parameters such as A, B, C, D, F, P and h. Five-layer
networks shown in Fig. 6 is built for prediction of the
tangent modulus. The prediction of networks for the
Young’s modulus and yielding stress are similar to Fig. 6.
Fig. 5 The curves corresponding to the loading and
unloading curves are fitted using a polynomial law
P=Ah2+Bh and P=Ch2+Dh+F, respectively.
