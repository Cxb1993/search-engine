2error linear equalization was done in [2]. Their study has
relied on an upper bound approach based on Chernoff
inequality theory because of its simplicity. The accurate
outage performance of 90Mbs 64-QAM microwave
radio systems with a 7-tap linear equalizer was
presented in [3]. Several efforts have done on the
performance analysis of 64-QAM microwave radio
systems. However, since the simulation are extremely
complex and time-consuming, the extension to 256 or
1024 QAM has not been studied. Moreover, the use of
the decision feedback equalizer, which is superior to the
linear equalizer for a severely distorted radio channel
[4], with applications to terrestrial microwave systems
has not been discussed. Despite its superior
performance, DFEs have not been widely used in high-
bit-rate systems due to the difficulty of implementing its
recursive structure at very high clock rates. However, an
architectural optimization for maximizing the DFE
speed overcomes this problem [5].
The objective of this research is to provide fast and
precise performance analysis of optimal diversity
receiver structures with decision-feedback equalization
techniques for 256-QAM and 1024-QAM systems. The
optimal receiver with infinite-length equalizers cannot
be realized in practical design, but usually the presented
results, which quantify the limits of achievable
performance, can serve as a benchmark for developing a
practical radio receiver with suboptimal algorithms. For
each channel condition, the standard technique of
Gaussian quadrature rule (GQR) based on computation
of moments of the possible ISI’s is use to evaluate the
error rate. Several algorithms for computing GQR were
given in [7]-[9]. We chose the one which uses matrix of
unmodified moments, while the use of modified
moments may underestimate the performance if the
polynomials are not suitably chosen.
We consider a M-QAM transmission with symbols
given by , where and , the
information symbols on the in-phase and quadrature
rails, are assumed to be statistically independent and
take the values in the set . The M-
QAM baseband waveform is written as
(1)
where T is the symbol period. Pulse represents the
square-root raised cosine pulse with the roll-off
parameter which is often chosen to be about 0.25 to
0.33 for digital radio used at the common carrier bands
of 4 to 6 GHz. Generally, two filters with square-root
raised cosine spectrum are used in the transmitter and
receiver.
The multipath fading channel model developed by
Rummler has been often used to predict system
performance in point-to-point microwave transmission.
While we assume that the antenna spacing is sufficiently
large which allows for fading in the diversity channels
to be statistically independent, the transfer
characteristics for the kth diversity channel can be
written as
, (2)
where is the amplitude of the direct ray, and ,
and is the relative amplitude, the delay and the phase
of the second path. The parameter statistics are usually
obtained from field measurements. In general, ,
and are the quasi-static fitting parameters and is a
fixed delay parameter of value 6.3ns, an assumption
good for hop lengths less than 60 miles for LOS
microwave radio at 2-6 GHz. The frequency
can determine the position of the fade
minimum.
To completely specify the transfer function of the
channel, we need to know the parameters’ statistics. The
distribution of the parameter , the
average fade depths in dB on the kth channel, is well
approximated by a normal distribution with a standard
deviation of 5dB and a mean of 24.6dB; thus
. (3)
The dependence on the value of is limited and may
often be ignored. Also, we define
, which adequately represents the
relative notch fade depths and the resulting distribution
function is approximately exponential. A good
approximation for the experimental case considered at 6
GHz as
. (4)
The parameters and are actually correlated. We
have, however, made the simplifying assumption that
they are uncorrelated, and also assumed that only
minimum phase fades occur.
The distribution of phase parameter was found
to be independent of and . Its pdf can be
described as being uniform at two levels, with values
less than being five time more likely than values
greater than :
. (5)
The signal-to-noise ratio is referred to the signal-to-
noise ratio measured at the receiver when there is no
fading in the channel. The signal-to-noise ratio on the
kth diversity path is derived as with
. The values of SNR for all diversity
paths are assumed to be identical. In [1], the SNR is
defined as the ratio of unfaded signal power to the
filtered noise power. This approach may not be practical
for calculating propagation distances. The resultant
performance could therefore be underestimated.
A. Diversity Receivers
Optimum combining diversity reception revealed
by the theory is composed of a set of matched filters
whose outputs are first combined and sampled. These
samples are then passed through an infinite-length
tapped-delay transversal filter. Such a diversity receiver
not only requires less hardware for implementation but
is more robust. In our analysis, ideal structures (i.e. ideal
transmit and receive filters, transversal filters with
infinite taps, optimal tap gains, optimal timing recovery,
ideal carrier recovery and decision levels) are assumed.
We assume the channels are statistically independent

It follows that
(21)
Knowing and allows us to calculate the
output equalized sequence in (17). The equalized
noise power is derived as
. (22)
Given the output sequence and the noise power
in (11) and (12) for the linear equalization and in (17)
and (22) for decision-feedback equalization, an accurate
error rate can be estimated fairly fast by using the
following method.
The output signal at the output of the post-
combining equalizer is given by
, (23)
where is the equalized impulse
response with in-phase and quadrature signals.
We have defined equalized noise , where
and are identically distributed Gaussian
random processes corrupting the in-phase and
quadrature rails. We assume that these processes have
variance equal to and therefore . The
estimates corresponding to the transmitted in-phase and
quadrature phase symbols and are
(24)
and
. (25)
With a slight change in indexing the signal, we denote
intersymbol interference in the in-phase and quadrature
channels, respectively, as
(26)
and
. (27)
The symbol error probability can be bounded tightly
by . Since and are
identical and independent, the interference in the in-
phase and quadrature parts has identical probability
distribution. Thus, we obtain . It
follows that
(28)
where we define a function
. (29)
Recall that can be computed from (12) and
(22) depending on the type of equalization. The
estimation of using simulation can be
computationally intensive, especially when dealing with
low error rates and higher-order modulation systems
with diversity reception. The use of Gaussian quadrature
rule (GQR) can overcome this problem [7][8].
Gaussian Quadrature Rule
An approximation technique for is based
on the observation that this average can be formally
expressed as an integral
(30)
where denotes the probability function of the
random variable with range . The Gaussian
quadrature rule (GQR) can be used to compute
when the is not known explicitly or when closed form
integration is not possible. The procedure is based on
approximating by a discrete random with
, . The are called the
abscissas (or points or nodes) and are called weights
(or coefficients). The set of abscissas and weights can be
found by means of an algorithm that requires only the
knowledge of the moments of . Several algorithms
have been proposed to compute and [7]-[9]. We
show that the error probability may be underestimated
by the use of modified moments if the orthogonal
polynomials are not suitably chosen. We have computed
the average in (30) by means of the classic GQR’s
suggested by Golub and Welsch [7]. Herein, we briefly
outline the algorithm used to compute classic GQR, but
with some corrections to some formulas presented in the
previous study [8].
.三、結果與討論
Our simulation and analysis were carried out
mainly for a 120Mbs 256-QAM system and 150Mbs
1024-QAM. The actual baud interval
seconds has been normalized to
one, i.e. second. The relative delay of the
reflected ray is 6.3ns, which can be normalized to
. We also extend the analysis to the case with a
relative delay equivalent to (seven times the
value of ). which can be seen as a normalized
delay for a 840Mbs 256-QAM system and 1050 Mbs
1024-QAM modulation schemes. The rolloff parameter
is set to 0.25 in the following numerical results. The
total number of iterations should be on the order of 100/
p where p is the true average error rate for each SNR,
which generates an acceptable confidence interval in
Monte Carlo simulation. We consider a truncated
impulse response of 20 samples and a 10-order GQR. It
takes about two days of computer time for each fading
case while the GQR method is used. The tightness of the
upper bound to the accurate error probability is also
examined carefully.
