In the past two decades, to determine 
global, 5-axis accessible CL data with local 
millability (without gouging due to the 
curvature limitation between ball end cutters 
and impeller surfaces), various approaches 
with experimental tests have been attempted 
[1-7].  To find interference-free zones for 
5-axis tool paths, Wang [1] proposed an 
algorithm by setting up solid models based 
on a moving frame of reference.  Again, 
constructing solid modeling technique, 
Takeuchi and Idemura [2] as well as 
Takeuchi and Watanabe [3] generated 
collision-free 5-axis tool paths by checking 
shape data sets of tools that are never within 
the workpieces of impellers.  For increasing 
machining efficiency and surface quality of 
turbomachinery components, Morishige et al. 
[4] applied a 3-D configuration space which 
enables users to generate CL data of ball end 
cutters reflecting their own 5-axis machining 
strategies for tool collision avoidance and 
smooth tool paths without considering 
gouging.  In consideration of the scallop 
height and the chordal deviation on machined 
impeller surfaces, Tsay et al. [5] generated 
global interference-free CL data using a 
conservative algorithm to check schemed 
cutter contact (CC) points. 
Instead of employing the traditional 
point milling approach for increasing 
machining efficiency and surface quality, Wu 
[6] proposed the flank milling technique by 
approximating surfaces of turbomachinery 
components as ruled surfaces.  To reduce 
discrepancies between designed and 
machined twisted ruled surfaces of impellers, 
Tsay and Her [7] established an analytical 
model to account for undercutting incurred in 
flank milling.  
In machining an impeller with a general 
5-axis machine tool, its three linear axes are 
used to guide its tool to specified CC points 
which are to be milled on impeller surfaces.  
And the two rotational (rotating and tilting) 
axes of the 5-axis machine tool are utilized to 
adjust its cutter axis to avoid global collision.  
To determine the tool posture, especially in 
milling hub surfaces, since the tip of a ball 
end cutter has the lowest efficiency in 
material removal rates, the rotating and 
tilting angles rendering the direction of the 
cutter axis collinear to that of the normal of a 
CC point should be avoided.  Even though 
such a situation can be avoided in milling, 
infinite combinations of rotating and tilting 
angles are still possible.  As a result, 
interference-free tool paths with local 
millability and reverse movements of moving 
axes in finish milling may still be generated.  
Since such a change of motion directions of 
moving axes along a tool path can enlarge 
the effect of any existing clearances in 
transmission elements on machine tools, it 
will result in a kind of a gouge problem.  
And unexpected tool marks will then be left 
on the machined impeller surfaces. 
To overcome the problem mentioned 
above, a procedure that can be used to 
determine CL data for 5-axis tool paths 
without leaving tool marks on the surfaces of 
impellers in finish milling is developed.  To 
scheme preliminary cutter paths for rough 
and semi-finish cuts, a simple yet useful 
method is proposed to produce global 5-axis 
interference-free CL data with local 
millability by approximating blade surfaces 
of an impeller as ruled surfaces with 
sufficient offsets.  In the subsequent step, 
the track of each angular motion axis of a 
5-axis tool path is observed for any change of 
its motion directions.  Once a reverse 
motion is identified, the CL data are then 
adjusted and smoothed by the least squares 
B-spline approach.  To illustrate the 
feasibility of the procedure, an experimental 
cutting test is given by the use of the 
proposed algorithms in 5-axis milling of a 
complex centrifugal compressor impeller. 
BACKGROUND 
    Blade, hub, and offset surfaces.  To 
determine global interference-free 5-axis 
cutter paths for rough and semi-finish cuts, 
the geometric representation of an impeller 
will be briefly discussed here.  As shown in 
Fig. 1, in the design stage of an impeller, 
basic, discrete geometric data sets given in a 
cylindrical coordinate system can be 
interpolated to define the shroud camberline,

In Fig. 3, intersection point of A-axis 
and C-axis is set as the origin of the machine 
coordinate system.  For a 5-axis accessible 
CL data, the coordinates of its cutter center 
( cP ) and the vector of its cutter axis ( T ) can 
be determined.  The rotating angle, zφ , 
around C-axis and the tilting angle, xφ , 
around A-axis corresponding to the CL data, 
can be computed as follows.  As shown in 
Fig. 4, the rotating angle, zφ , can be written 
as

where 22 yxf +=  and x  and y  are 
the components of T  projected onto the

be described as

where 22 zye +=  and y and z  are 
the components of T  projected onto the 
Y-Z plane.

The cutter center cP  then needs be 
transformed to a new position at cP′ .  It 
can be obtained as

where )]([ zzR φ  and )]([ xxR φ are 
rotational transformation matrices about 
Z-axis and X-axis, respectively.  As a result, 
the coordinates and angles for the 5-axis NC 
data of X, Y, Z, A, and C in Fig. 3 be decided 
for an accessible CL data. 
PRELIMINARY 5-AXIS TOOL PATHS              
Before modifying tool paths for finish 
cuts without leaving tool marks, 5-axis 
accessible CL data must be generated.  For 
such a CL data, its cutter center and tool axis 
vector must be found.  To improve the 
cutting efficiency in the rough cutting 
process, an end mill shown in Fig. 5 is used 
to increase the material removal rate [8].  
The tool center of the end mill can be 
assumed that it has the same position as that 
of a ball end mill with the same diameter 
employed in semi-finish and finish cuts.

mill 
The most critical CC points which have 
a growing tendency to incur interference than 
others in cutting are located in the areas near 
the two intersection curves between a hub 
surface and its pressure surface as well as the 
hub surface and its suction surface.  
Generation of interference-free CL points for 
such CC points must first be considered.  
Based on the geometric model of an impeller, 
the offset surfaces of its hub and blade 
surfaces with an offset equal to the radius of 
a selected tool are first constructed.  As 
illustrated in Fig. 6, the intersection points on 
offset surfaces of the hub surface and its 
pressure surface as well as on offset surfaces 
of the hub surface and its suction surface can 
be computed as the cutter center points for 
tool paths between the leading edge and the 
trailing edge.  And the line directional 
vector of a ruling on the ruled offset surface 
of a blade can be chosen as the initial tool 
axis vector.  Corresponding to the initial 
tool axis, its calculated rotating angle of zφ  
around the C-axis shown in Fig. 3 is then 
increased by about 1 ~ 2 degrees to its

(2)  Transform angular positions of a 
rotational axis obtained above to form an 
angular displacement curves and to see 
any reverse movements.  If reverse 
movements do not exist, coordinate 
values for axes of X, Y, Z, A, and C are 
recorded for machining and then go to 
Step (9). 
(3)  Modify angular displacements of 
A-axis and C-axis within a limit to avoid 
reverse movements. 
(4)  Smooth the angular positions 
corresponding to the modified angular 
displacements above by using the least 
squares method with four cubic 
B-splines. 
(5)  Check A-axis and C-axis for any 
reverse movements.  If reverse 
movements still appear, go back to Step 
(3). 
(6)  Calculate the new tool center positions 
for the varied tool postures and examine 
the adjusted tool path for 5-axis 
accessibility.  If it is 5-axis accessible, 
coordinate values for the five axes are 
recorded and then go to Step (9).  
(7)  Increase the rotating angle of C-axis by 
an increment of C∆  about 1 ~ 2 
degrees and compute the new tool 
centers before detecting any interference.  
If it becomes 5-axis accessible, values 
for axes of X, Y, Z, A, and C are 
recorded for machining and go to Step 
(9).  Otherwise, increase the rotating 
angle of C-axis again without exceeding 
the maximum allowable angle, Cmax, 
indicated in Fig. 6 and repeat the same 
process.  If interference still appears 
with the maximum allowable angle, Cmax, 
go to the next step. 
(8)  Use a small tool for finish cutting and 
go to Step (1). 
(9)  Finish the tuning task.  
Modification of reverse movements 
for A-axis and C-axis.  As illustrated in 
Fig. 9, if the angular displacement of a 
rotational axis is found with reverse 
movements, the displacement values in the 
range having a different direction need be 
shifted by plus or minus an angle of Lφ  to 
ensure that the complete angular 
displacements have the same moving 
direction along the tool path.  Based on the 
changed angular displacements, their new 
angular positions have to be smoothed  by 
the least squares method with four cubic 
B-splines as basis functions.  Then the 
approximated angular displacement curve of 
the smoothed angular positions is checked.  
If reverse movements still exist, in an 
iterative way, the angular displacement curve 
is shifted by a value of Lφ  again.  Such a 
process is finished, when the angular 
positions of A-axis and C-axis are free of 
reverse movements along a tool path.  
      
 
 
 
Fig. 8  Modification of angular 
displacement curve 
Since the angular positions of A-axis 
and C-axis are changed, 5-axis accessibility 
along the tool path must be checked.  As 
stated earlier, if interference found, the 
rotating angle of C-axis can be increased by 
an increment of C∆  step by step to avoid it.  
As shown in Fig. 6, the maximum allowable 
rotating angle, maxC , which can be used is 
described as  
))/((cosC -1max ECEFECEF ⋅=    (7) 
The least squares method.  To smooth 
the shifted angular positions of A-axis and 
C-axis, the approximated angular positions, 
)(tB , of A-axis and C-axis in a parametric 
least squares sense can be represented as

tool path with 475 CC points from the 
leading edge to the trailing edge along the 
intersection curve of the pressure surface and 
the hub surface.  Note that in Fig. 10 the 
units for the vertical coordinate are mm for 
translational axes and degree for rotational 
axes.  Especially, to confirm that the tool 
path was free of interference in finish cuts, 
the 475 CC points all passed the examination 
for 5-axis accessibility.  Photograph of the 
machined pressure surface without any 
interference is shown in Fig. 11.  However, 
it can be seen that there are four areas for 
tool marks left on the machined pressure 
surface.  Even with a reduction of the 
cutting feed rate from 3,000 mm/min to 500 
mm/min, the tool marks were still there.

Figure 12 shows the angular and 
translational displacement curves obtained by 
transforming the angular and translational 
positions of the tool path plotted in Fig. 10.  
It can be observed that reverse tool 
movements appeared with A-axis, X-axis, 
Y-axis, and Z-axis.  More importantly, as 
indicated in Fig. 12, the positions with zero 
values for the angular displacement curve of 
A-axis match the areas where the tool marks 
presented in Fig. 11. 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 12  Displacement curves with reverse 
movements 
To remove the tool marks left on the 
machined blade surfaces, the angular 
positions corresponding to the regions where 
reverse movements presented about A-axis in 
Fig. 12 are then adjusted and approximated 
by least squares cubic B-splines.  As 
mentioned earlier, once the rotational 
positions are changed, their new tool centers 
must be calculated.  Also, the modified tool 
path must be further checked for 5-axis 
accessibility.  For improving the tool path 
illustrated in Fig. 10, Fig. 13 shows the tuned 
angular and translational displacement curves 
without reverse movements through 
adjusting angular positions about A-axis.  
The resulting angular and translational 
positions of the smoothed 5-axis accessible 
tool path are plotted in Fig. 14.  Obviously, 
the smoothed tool path is no longer with 
reverse movements for each axis.
