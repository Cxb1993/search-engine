The applications of ferromagnetic thin film and the study of its micromagnetic be-
havior are important issues today. The continuum foundations of micromagnetic thin
films are the Maxwell equations and the Landau-Lifshitz equation. In this project we are
concerned with the computations of micromagnetic thin films. According to the internal
symmetry group preserving scheme developed in the previous project, which enhances
computational accuracy and efficiency, the Landau-Lifshitz equation together with the
energy minimizer of energy functional of magnetization distribution in the thin films un-
der effective field are constructed with the aid of Maxwell equations. The resulting field
equations are computed by a semi-discretization numerical scheme, which at each grid
of the thin film the group-preserving method is employed to enhance the conservation
of magnetization magnitude. This computational micromagnetism basing on a concrete
theoretical foundation may lead to a deeper understanding of hysteresis effects by visual-
ization of the magnetization reversal process.

Among them, thebest known are the Euler method and the Runge-Kuttamethod, but less known is the group preserving scheme(GPS) developed by Liu (2001, 2004a). All these meth-ods discretize the differential equations system to pro-duce difference equations or mappings. The methods ob-tain different mappings from the same differential equa-
tions, but they have the same aim in that the dynamics
of the mapping should correspond closely to the dynam-
ics of the differential equations. However, it is a major
question whether the corresponding approximation has
the same behavior as the original differential equations.
For a semi-discretization of the Landau-Lifshitz equation
it is crucial to preserving the magnetization magnitude at
each grid point, and keeping a global Lyapunov property
of the free energy functional which guarantees the mag-
netization tending to stable states of the free energy min-
ima. The commonly used methods for the integration of
the system of ordinary differential equations discretized
from the Landau-Lifshitz equation is the Runge-Kutta
method and its variants, due to the high-accuracy and ex-
plicitness. However, many researches are reported that
the explicit numerical method is unstable, and in order
to get a stable calculation the time steps are required to
be terribly small. The numerical scheme for the general
purpose is usually not expected to preserve the magne-
tization magnitude automatically, making it necessary to
impose the constraint or repeatedly project the solutions
onto the constraint manifold. Recent studies have sug-
gested using the implicit midpoint rule, which has much
better stable property but is computationally expensive.
Especially, when the resultant differential equations are
highly-dimensional for an accuracy consideration or for
the resolution of fine structures like as domain walls and
magnetic vortices of the magnets leading the unknowns
in the discretization of the Landau-Lifshitz equation may
up to one million, we are prefered to use such an explicit
integration scheme that has high accuracy and is able to
preserve the magnetization properties.
Usually, the majority of nonlinear studies about the
micromagnetics are carried out by numerical integra-
tion techniques; see, e.g., Banas and Slodicka (2005),
Bertotti, Mayergoyz and Serpico (2001), Cimrak and
Slodicka (2004), E and Wang (2000), Frank (2004),
Garcia-Cervera and Gimbutas (2003), Garcia-Cervera
and E (2003), Hayashi, Nakatani and Uesaka (2003),
Huang (2003), Krishnaprasad and Tan (2001), Lewis and
Nigam (2003), Serpico, Mayergoyz and Bertotti (2001),
Slodicka and Cimrak (2003), Spargo, Ridley and Roberts
(2003), Sun, Ma and Qin (2004), and Wang, Garcia-
Cervera and E (2001). However, many existing numer-
ical integration techniques may corrupt the conserved
properties of magnetization dynamics. For this reason,
it is important to develop a numerical method that can
retain this conserving properties automatically.
Numerical micromagnetic modeling using finite differ-
ence or finite element methods reveal the correlation be-
tween the local arrangement of the magnetic moments
and the microstructural features on a length scale of sev-
eral nanometers. Computational micromagnetics gives a
quantative treatment of the influence of the microstruc-
ture and shape of the magnetic device on the magneti-
zation reversal and hysteresis processes, and leads to a
deeper understanding of the magnetization process. All
of that entirely hinges on a faithful calculation of the
Landau-Lifshitz equation; however, even the spatial dis-
cretization is usually carried out trying to retain the main
properties of the free energy functional, little attention is
paid to the preservation of the peculiar structure after a
time discretization of the Landau-Lifshitz equation.
The issue of developing a suitable time-stepping tech-
nique for the Landau-Lifshitz equation that preserves rel-
evant properties has received some attention by the re-
searchers, to name a few, Banas and Slodicka (2005),
Frank (2004), Krishnaprasad and Tan (2001), Lewis and
Nigam (2003), and Sun, Ma and Qin (2004). The general
point of view of these contributions is the use of suitable
geometrical integrators designed to preserve the geomet-
rical properties of dynamics. Also, the development of
integrators for the Landau-Lifshitz equation based on
Lie group SO(3) have been investigated by Frank (2004)
and Lewis and Nigam (2003). These methods preserve
the magnetization magnitude, but they do not generally
preserve the Lyapunov property of the Landau-Lifshitz
equation and the free energy in the limit of zero damp-
ing.
In this paper we develop a new numerical procedure
to study the dynamical behavior of micromagnetic sys-
tems according to an inherent Lie group SOo(3,1) sym-
metry of the Landau-Lifshitz equation derived by Liu
(2004a). A numerical algorithm which preserves the
inherent symmetry will have a long-term stability and

Eq. (10) with the above G constitutes a group preserv-
ing numerical scheme for quasilinear system (2). The
scheme about m for the nonlinear system (1) is a projec-
tion of the above transformation:
m(n+1)
Gssm(n)+Gs0
G0s m(n)+G00
. (15)
Thus we obtain an explicit single-step forward finite
difference scheme. We should emphasize that the
group preserving scheme preserves the internal symme-
try PSOo(3,1) of the model so as to satisfy m ∈ S2 auto-
matically at each time step without any iteration at all.
4 A semi-discretization method
Micromagnetics is a continuum theory of ferromagnetic
materials, which allows for the computation of magneti-
zation distributions in samples of arbitrary shape (Brown,
1963; Hubert, 1998). Its basic assumptions consist of
considering that the magnetization magnitude remains
constant (M = Msm,‖m‖= 1) and all vector quantities
vary slowly on the atomic scale. Exchange interactions
proceed from the Heisenberg exchange Hamiltonian in
the limit of infinitesimal rotations of the magnetic mo-
ment from site to site, leading to the free energy density
functional
ϕex = A‖∇m‖2, (16)
which simply means that the exchange energy will build
up as soon as the magnetization distribution ceases to be
uniform. In above, A is an exchange stiffness constant,
denpendent on materials. Anisotropy energy density ϕ an
is introduced phenomenologically, and its expression is
tailored to reflect the material symmetry. A magnetosta-
tic energy density functional
ϕde =−12µ0M ·Hde, (17)
corresponds to the existence of a demagnetized field,
where the 1/2 prefactor stems from the fact that M is
the source of Hde. Here, µ0 is the permeability of the
materials, and the demagnetized field can be obtained by
solving the Maxwell equations [Liu (2004b)]:
∇2U =∇ ·M, x ∈Ω, (18)
∇2U = 0, x ∈ R3\Ω, (19)
where x is the position vector of material point, which
occupies a bounded region Ω in the three-dimensional
space R3. The demagnetized field is given by
Hde =−∇U, (20)
where the potential is expressed as
U(x) =
1

]
.
(21)
Application of external field leads to a Zeeman type con-
tribution to the energy density functional
ϕZee = −µ0M ·Hext. (22)
After consideration of the above energy density function-
als, the total free energy of a ferromagnetical volume el-
ement reads as
E(M) =
 
Ω
[ϕex +ϕan +ϕde +ϕZee]dx. (23)
Brown (1963) first showed that the static equilibrium
conditions could be obtained from the calculus of vari-
ations (δE = 0) and expressed as a torque equation:

ergy functional with respect to M.

5 Applying a closed-form solution to the numerical
integration
When applied Eq. (2) to the numerical integration, we
can view A as a constant matrix at each time step and
each grid point. Thus, we solve Eq. (2) by decomposing
it into two subparts:
dXs
dt ′ =
ˆHXs +αX0H, (46)
dX0
dt ′
= αH ·Xs. (47)
Differentiating Eq. (47), inserting Eq. (46) for the differ-
ential of Xs and utilizing
( ˆH)pH = 0 (48)
for all positive integer p, we obtain
d2X0
dt ′2 = α
2‖H‖2X0. (49)
The general solution of the above equation is
X0(t ′) =C1 coshα‖H‖(t ′ − t ′i )+C2 sinhα‖H‖(t ′ − t ′i),
(50)
where C1 and C2 are determined by
C1 = X0(t ′i), C2 =
1
‖H‖H ·X
s(t ′i). (51)
Taking advantage of X 0 derived above, and using
Eq. (46) the formula for Xs can be obtained,
Xs(t ′) = exp[ ˆH(t ′ − t ′i )]Xs(t ′i)
+α
  t′

exp[ ˆH(t ′ −ξ)]X0(ξ)dξH, (52)
where Xs(t ′i) is a value of Xs at t ′i . By applying the
Cayley-Hamilton theorem for ˆH and through some cal-
culations as derived by Ku (2005) we get
exp[ ˆH(t ′ − t ′i)] = I3 + sin‖H‖(t ′ − t ′i )

It can be seen that the term G00 in Eq. (71) satisfies the re-
quirement in Eq. (9) for all time stepsize of ∆t; however,

ues in the program which corrupting the computational

,
which does not change the numerical value of M i as
shown by Eq. (29).
Basically, the numerical scheme in Section 4 is devel-
oped according to a Cayley transformation applied to the
matrix A at each time step and each grid point in Eq. (10),
whereas the numerical scheme in Section 5 is developed
through an exponential mapping of the matrix A which
being a constant matrix at each time step and each grid
point. No matter which schemes are used, they exactly
preserve the magnitude:
‖Mi‖= Ms, ∀ i ∈ (1, . . .,NN), (76)
since the resulting G is a Lie group of SO o(3,1). In
above, NN is the number of total grid points.
Eq. (76) is a fundamental property, which should be re-
spected in a time-discretization of the Landau-Lifshitz
equation. Because the usual time-stepping solutions do
not preserve this constraint, most reasearchers use a naive
approach of renormalizing the magnetization vector field
by a factor of Ms/‖Mi‖ after each time step. This
naive approach is actually a nonlinear modification of
the Landau-Lifshitz equation which might have a strong
effect on the subsequent computation of magnetostatic
field (Lewis and Nigam, 2003) to distort the magnetic
behavior, and is not recommended for a long-term inves-
tigation of the stable magnetic behavior.
6 The numerical tests by GPS-RK4
There are several versions of the Landau-Lifshitz equa-
tion depending on which fields are taken into account.
Because we are focusing to assess the performance of our
new program, the version we use here is a slightly simple
situation that discarding the anisotropic and demagnetiz-
ing fields. The schemes for a more general formulation
would build on the work presented here.
6.1 Considering the exchange field
In order to evaluate the above numerical integration
methods, let us consider a one-dimensional magnetiza-
tion problem with a magnet of length  = 10−7 m, which
we subjecting it first to the exchange field:
Heff =
2A
µ0M2s
∇2M, (77)
whose discretization is carried out by a central differ-
ence:
Hieff =
2A
µ0M2s (∆x)2
[Mi+1−2Mi +Mi−1], (78)
where the grid spacing length is given by ∆x = /(NN−
1). The time marching integrations usually terminate at
an end time T and N = T/∆t is the total number of time
steps required to furnish this calculation.
Unless otherwise specified, in all calculations the mater-
ial constants used were fixed to be
µ0 = 4π×10−7 N/A2,
γ= 221020 m/As,
α= 0.04,
Ms = 1000000 A/m,
A = 2π×10−13 J/m.
The initial magnetization vector is
Mi,1(0) = Ms cosθi sinφi,
Mi,2(0) = Ms sinθi sinφi,
Mi,3(0) = Ms cosφi,
where θi = 2(i − 1)π/(NN − 1) and φi = (i −
1)kπ/(NN−1). NN is the total grid points including the

oped in Sections 4 and 5 is very effective and easy to im-
plement. When other fields are considered, we only need
to modify the terms H 1eff, H2eff and H3eff in the program.
In Table 1 we compare the numerical solutions of the
magnetization vector for different grid spacing lengths
and different time stepsizes at an end time T = 10−9 sec
with k = 1. The four cases produce the same behav-
ior: the x-component is symmetric with respect to the
mid point x = 0.5×10−7 m, and the y and z-components
are skew-symmetric. ¿From this table it can be seen
that the program executes very stably for a larger range
of time stepsizes and grid spacing lengths. Even under
the two extremal conditions of N = 1000, NN = 21 and
N = 20000, NN = 101 the numerical results as shown
in Fig. 1 for the three components of the magnetization
are still having the accuracy within the vision of plot-
ting. This fact is very important for our investigating the
stable configuration of magnetization and the motion of
domain walls, which usually require a long-time calcula-
tions. If one can make N×NN smaller, one can do more
investigation of the stable behaviors in the magnetization
process.
We have directly applied the fourth-order Runge-Kutta
scheme (RK4) to the discretization of Eq. (1) at each grid
point:
∂Mi
∂t = γH

eff ×Mi−

where
Ki1 = fi(tn,Mi(n)),
Ki2 = fi(tn+∆t/2,Mi(n)+∆t/2Ki1),
Ki3 = fi(tn+∆t/2,Mi(n)+∆t/2Ki2),
Ki4 = fi(tn+∆t,Mi(n)+∆tKi3)
with fi denoting the vector field on the right-hand side of
Eq. (79). However, in order to have a correct and stable
calculation of the megnetization configuration we need to
largely reduce the time stepsizes, for example, ∆t = 2×
10−12 for the case A= 2π×10−13 J/m, and it needs about
four times calculation cost than that for GPS integration;
moreover, the RK4 is unfortunately failed to preserve the
magnitude ‖Mi‖ = Ms even it has fourth-order accuracy
as shown in Fig. 2.
We can combine the two advantages of the accuracy
by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme and the preser-
vation of ‖Mi‖ = Ms by the group preserving scheme
into a single program with a calculation from a given
M(n) to a tentative new value of M ′(n + 1) by the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. Inserting the aver-
age [M(n)+M′(n+1)]/2 into Eq. (78) to calculate H ieff,

can be seen that the configuration approach to a stable
state and the final configuration is similar to the one with
A = 2π×10−13 J/m; however, the former is more fast to
approach the stable configuration. The final stable con-
figuration seems independent of the exchange constant.
Even the Runge-Kutta method itself is found less sta-
ble, we have taken advantage of its accuracy into a new
numerical method, which is realized here by a suitable
combination of GPS and RK4, namely GPS-RK4. The
flow diagram is summarized in Fig. 4. Mathematically
speaking, the execution of GPS-RK4 is carried out by
the fourth-order accurate approximation of the Lie alge-
bra A, and hence the group G obtained from it by an
exponential mapping is also accurate in the order of four.

6.4 Considering the anisotropy field
Magnetic domains result from the balance of several
competing energy terms, one of which we consider in
Section 6.1 is the exchange energy, which favors uni-
form magnetization configurations. In this section we
consider magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy, which
favors the orientation of the magnetization vector along
certain preferred directions. These directions are called
easy magnetization axes. They represent the directions
along which the magnetization naturally tends to mini-
mize the system free energy.
For cubic ferromagnetic materials the anisotropy energy
density can be written as:
ϕan = K1(m21m22 +m22m23 +m21m23), (94)
where K1 is an anisotropy material constant.

F30 Tech Science Press Galley Proof Only Please Return in 48 Hours.Substituting Eq. (94) into Eq. (25) and disregarding theother energy terms we obtainHieff = − 2K1µ0Ms {mi1[(mi2)2 +(mi3)2]e1+mi2[(mi1)2+(mi3)2]e2+mi3[(mi1)2+(mi2)2]e3}, (95)where e1, e2 and e3 are unit bases in the x, y and z-
directions.
We apply our GPS-RK4 method in this calculations by
considering the same initial conditions and boundary
conditions as that given in Section 6.1. The material con-
stants were fixed to be α= 0.1 and K1 = 4.8×104 J/m3.
Ms, µ0 and γ were the same as that given in Section 6.1.
We have compared the stable behaviors of the magnetiza-
tion vector with three different initial configurations with
k = 1, k = 2 and k = 3, respectively, in Figs. 10-12. For
the case of k = 1, while the x-component magnetization
reveals a symmetric distribution with respect to the cen-
ter of the magnet, both y and z-components have skew-
symmetric distributions along the longitudinal direction
of magnet. For the case of k = 2, while the x-component
magnetization reveals a perfect skew-symmetric distrib-
ution, both y and z-components appear defective sym-
metric distributions. The case of k = 3 is similar to the
case of k = 1, with the x-component revealing a symmet-
ric distribution, and y and z-components revealing skew-
symmetric distributions. However, these two cases have
very different stable configurations. The main features of
those distributions are that they are piecewise linear func-
tions of x, and that the regular rotations of magnetization
vector are caused by the anisotropy field alone.
6.5 Extension to the two-dimensional magnetization
Let us consider a two-dimensional magnetization prob-
lem with a square planar magnet with each side of length
 = 10−7 m, which we subjecting it to the exchange field
(77). The discretization of the exchange field is

[Mi, j+1−2Mi, j +Mi, j−1], (96)
where the grid spacing length is given by ∆x = ∆y =
/(NN−1), and Mi, j denotes the numerical value of the
magnetization vector at the i j-th grid point.
In order to apply the GPS-RK4 method for this problem,
we need first to carry out the calculation for the following
ODEs with RK4:
∂Mi, j
∂t = γH
i, j
eff ×Mi, j −

where
Ki, j1 = f

Ki, j4 = f
i, j(tn+∆t,Mi, j(n)+∆tKi, j3 )
with fi, j denoting the vector field on the right-hand side
of Eq. (97). Then, according to the procedures given in
Fig. 4 we can calculate this problem by the GPS-Rk4.
The material constants used in this calculation are the
same as that given in Section 6.1. The initial magneti-
zation vector is
Mi, j,1(0) = Ms cosθi sinφ j,
Mi, j,2(0) = Ms sinθi sinφ j,
Mi, j,3(0) = Ms cosφ j,
where θi = 2(i− 1)π/(NN − 1) and φ j = −π/2+( j−
1)π/(NN−1), and the boundary conditions are
Mi,1,1 = −Ms cosθi, Mi,1,2 =−Ms sinθi,
Mi,1,3 = 0, Mi,NN,1 = Ms cosθi,
Mi,NN,2 = Ms sinθi, Mi,NN,3 = 0,
M1, j,1 = Ms sinφ j, M1, j,2 = 0,
M1, j,3 = Ms cosφ j, MNN, j,1 = Ms sinφ j,
MNN, j,2 = 0, MNN, j,3 = Ms cosφ j.
The program based on the numerical integrations de-
veloped in Section 6.1 with a combination of RK4 and
GPS is applied to this case by adopting NN = 51 and

step and each grid point. No matter which schemes were
used, they exactly preserved the magnitude of magne-
tization vector since the resulting G is a Lie group of
SOo(3,1). To enhance its capability we effectively com-
bined the GPS with RK4 to generate a computational
technique of GPS-RK4. We have shown through sev-
eral numerical examples that the GPS-RK4 not only con-
serves the magnetization magnitude, has an accuracy of
fourth-order and also preserves the Lyapunov property of
the Landau-Lifshitz equation. For the limit of zero damp-
ing, the GPS-RK4 also leads to a free energy conserving
algorithm. In most calculations by the GPS-RK4 of the
Landau-Lifshitz equation under exchange field the time
steps are in the order of 10−12-10−11 sec, and usually
20-50 grid points are enough to resolve the fine struc-
tures depending on the problems been considered. It de-

damping constant (Gilbert, 1955), respectively. The effective field Heff is the sum of the
applied field, the demagnetizing field, the anisotropy field and the exchange field.
The Landau-Lifshitz equation is essential to the interpretation of the dynamics of domain
wall (Zhai, 1997), ferromagnetic resonance (Fetisov, Patton and Sygonach, 1999), and mag-
netization switching in thin film recording media (Schrefl, Fidler, Su¨ss and Scholz, 2000), and
its extension beyond the restriction that this equation is introduced for small magnetization
motions and for the case of high magnetic symmetry with an isotropic damping parameter
has been made by Safonov (2002) and Safonov and Bertram (2003). Recently, an exact an-
alytical result was obtained by Bertotti, Serpico and Mayergoyz (2001) for a magnetic body
exhibiting rotational symmetry about a certain axis and the external field being circularly
polarized in the perpendicular plane. Besides that very few exact solutions are known for the
nonlinear magnetization problems. Usually, the majority of nonlinear studies are carried out
by the numerical integration techniques, e.g., Frank (2004), Krishnaprasad and Tan (2001)
and Serpico, Mayergoyz and Bertotti (2001).
It will be useful to recall some of the basic and essentially well known elements of gener-
alized Hamiltonian formulation of mechanical systems. The classical Hamiltonian mechanics
is endowed with an even-dimensional phase space. In practice, there are many mechanical
systems whose phase spaces are not canonical. That is, the phase manifold doesn’t admit a
cotangent bundle structure on it, but still has a Poisson bracket equipped with the properties
of skew-symmetry, bilinearity, the Leibniz identity and the Jacobi identity. The most famous
example is the Euler equations, governing the motion of rigid body.
Suppose that P is a manifold. If there is a bracket {•, •} defined on the function space
C(P ), which possesses the following properties:
Skew-symmetry : {F, G} = −{G, F}, (2)
Bilinearity : {λF + µG, H} = λ{F, H}+ µ{G, H}, λ, µ ∈ R, (3)
Jacobi identity : {F, {G, H}}+ {G, {H, F}}+ {H, {F, G}} = 0, (4)
Leibniz identity : {FG, H} = F{G, H}+ {F, H}G, (5)
then (P, {•, •}) is a Poisson manifold (Marsden and Ratiu, 1994). If an observable function
F : P 7→ R of a dynamical system can be governed by a generalized Hamiltonian function
H through
F˙ = {F, H}, (6)
then (P, {•, •}, H) is called a generalized Hamiltonian system.
Let H : P 7→ R be a smooth function on P . The generalized Hamiltonian vector field
XH associated with H is a unique smooth vector field on P , which for every smooth function
F : P 7→ R satisfies
XH(F ) = {F, H}. (7)
Instead of the non-degeneracy of classical Poisson bracket, the bracket defined on the non-
canonical Poisson manifold is permitted degenerate.
Suppose that C : P 7→ R is a non-constant smooth function on P . If {C, F} = 0
for all smooth function F : P 7→ R, then C is a Casimir function on P . When P is a
finite-dimensional manifold with dimensions n, the local coordinates of P can be assigned
as x = (x1, . . . , xn), and the Poisson bracket on P can be written as
{F, G} := Jij
∂F
∂xi
∂G
∂xj

such that by introducing the generator
S = γM ·Heff, (16)
one can obtain
M˙i = {Mi, S} = εijkMk(∇S)j, (17)
where εijk is the permutation symbol. It can be seen that Jij = εijkMk is a Lie-Poisson
tensor, and Eq. (17) is a Lie-Poisson system. However, under this formulation there has a
weak point that S is not an invariance of the system unless Heff is a constant vector. Then,
Bloch et al. [13] extended their formulation to system (1) by adding a symmetric dissipative
bracket:
{{F, G}}(M) =
α
Ms
[M×∇F (M)] · [M×∇G(M)], (18)
and obtained a two-bracket form of system (1):
M˙i = {Mi, S}+ {{Mi, S}}. (19)
Previously, Liu (2000, 2002) has developed a Jordan algebra basis of the Landau-Lifshitz
equation, and then Liu (2004) has derived a Lie type linear system representation in the
Minkowski space. Here, we analyze the Landau-Lifshitz equation from another four new
different aspects, namely, a two-generator formalism, an isospectral flow, a double-bracket
form, and a Lie-Poisson bracket formulation which rendering the coadjoint orbit on the in-
variant manifold of the system with a constant H = α‖M‖2/(2M2s ) rather than the above
S = γM·Heff. This paper not only manifests the mathematically structural elegance and the
diversity in the guise of the Landau-Lifshitz equation, but also provides a new thought that
this nonlinear dissipative equation can be examined from different aspects. The significance
of these four representations is that these different forms are associated with their related
mathematical physics so that the intrinsic properties of the Landau-Lifshitz equation, which
had not yet been found before, are thoroughly uncovered.
2 Two-generator formalism
Corresponding to the one-generator formulation as shown in equation (19) for the Landau-
Lifshitz equation, there is a two-generator formulation. The two-generator bracket formal-
ism is the one that appears first in the original development for the dynamics of dissipa-
tive systems by Kaufman (1984), Morrison (1984) and Grmela (1984). Recent progress of
this formalism leads to the GENERIC (general equation for the nonequilibrium reversible-
irreversible coupling) framework (Beris, 2001; Grmela and O¨ttinger, 1997, and O¨ttinger and
Grmela 1997), in which the time evolution of any isolated thermodynamic system can be
written in the form
dx
dt
= L(x)
δE(x)
δx
+ M(x)
δS(x)
δx
, (20)
where L and M are certain operators, δ • /δx signifies a Frechet derivative, and E and S
represent, respectively, the total energy and entropy expressed in terms of the state variables
x. The use of two generators, the energy for the reversible dynamics and the entropy for
the irreversible dynamics, is the characteristic feature of GENERIC. The major advantage
of the GENERIC framework is that it can be derived from Hamilton’s equations for classical
systems or from Heisenberg’s equations for quantum systems. Two notable equations that
4
be the quantity dominated the dissipation of the system. ∇S = H follows directly and
Eq. (24) is thus verified in view of Eqs. (25) and (28).
Now, we prove that η is non-negative definite. From Eq. (25) the symmetry of η is
obvious. Then, by
vT[I3 −m⊗m]v = ‖v‖
2 − (v ·m)2 ≥ 0, ∀v ∈ R3, (31)
we prove that α(I3−m⊗m) ≥ 0 and thus η is non-negative definite. In above the superscript
T denotes the transpose. In addition, the two degenerate conditions (26) and (27) are easily
identified with the help of Eqs. (23), (25), (29) and (30). 
For arbitrary two functions F (m) and G(m), let us define the Poisson bracket by
{F, G}(m) := ∇F (m) · [Hˆ∇G(m)] = −H · [∇F (m)×∇G(m)], (32)
and the dissipative bracket by
{{F, G}}(m) := ∇F (m) · [η(m)∇G(m)] = α[m×∇F (m)] · [m×∇G(m)]. (33)
Since Hˆ is skew-symmetric and is assumed to be independent of m, it satisfying Eqs. (9) and
(10) is a Poisson tensor. The skew-symmetric Hˆ and the non-negative definite η guarantee
the skew-symmetry of the Poisson bracket defined in Eq. (32) and the symmetry of the
dissipative bracket defined in Eq. (33). Then, a bracket, called the two-generator bracket,
composed of the above two brackets is the underlying bracket structure for Eq. (24). The
governing equation for this system is thus simply given by
F˙ = {F, E}+ {{F, S}} = ∇F · (Hˆ∇E) + ∇F · (η∇S). (34)
As the consequences of Eqs. (23) and (25)-(27) we have
E˙ = {E, E}+ {{E, S}} = ∇E · (Hˆ∇E) + ∇E · (η∇S) = 0, (35)
S˙ = {S, E}+ {{S, S}} = ∇S · (Hˆ∇E) + ∇S · (η∇S) ≥ 0, (36)
which indicate that E is a conservative quantity and S has a natural physical interpretation
as the entropy of this system. Especially, because of
{{E, F}} = 0 (37)
for arbitrary differentiable function F (m), E may be viewed as a Casimir function of the
dissipative bracket dynamics.
It deserves to note that our formulation of the Landau-Lifshitz equation is different from
that proposed by Bloch et al. [13], which as presented in Eq. (19) is an one-generator for-
mulation. The comparisons of these two formulations and the others to be discussed below
are summarized in Table 1.
3 Isospectral flow and double-bracket flow
The double-bracket flow
Y˙ = [[Y,N],Y], t ≥ 0, Y(0) = Y0 ∈ Sym(n) (38)
6
It deserves to note that the first and second terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (44)
correspond, respectively, to the first and second terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (24).
The two brackets in Eq. (44) are respectively the Lie bracket and the double bracket in a
literal sense.
In the corotated frame m is given as mR = RTm and H as HR = RTH, where the
rotation matrix R satisfies
R˙ = HˆR, R(0) = I3. (46)
Then, from Eq. (22) we can prove the following result.
Theorem 3. In the corotated frame, the Landau-Lifshitz Eq. (22) admits a double-bracket
flow representation with
˙ˆm
R
= [[mˆR, αHˆR], mˆR], t ≥ 0, mˆR(0) = mˆR0 ∈ Skew(3). (47)
Proof. From Eq. (22) we have
m˙R = αHR − αHR ·mRmR (48)
due to RTR = I3. The above equation can be written as
m˙R = α(mR ×HR)×mR (49)
due to the invariance of mR ·mR = m ·m = 1. Then, skew-symmetrizing the above equation
and employing the equivalence as specified in Eq. (43) we can arrive at Eq. (47). 
4 Linear representation in the Minkowski space
The above techniques employed to derive the bracket formulas for the Landau-Lifshitz equa-
tion rely on the introduction of flow equations in different spaces. These derivations prompt
us to define an integrating factor for Eq. (22),
X0 := exp
( ∫ t
0
S(ξ)dξ
)
= exp
(
α
∫ t
0
[H(ξ) ·m(ξ)]dξ
)
. (50)
The above equation together with Eq. (30) assert that
X0(t1) ≥ X
0(t2), t1 ≥ t2, (51)
provided that S(t) ≥ 0, which implies that the angle between the magnetization and the
effective field is less than 900. Then Eq. (51) indicates that X0 is a time-like variable of the
system, and is pointing to the future.
Accordingly, we can prove the following theorem with a slight extension of the results
given by Liu (2004).
Theorem 4. The Landau-Lifshitz Eq. (22) admits a linear system X˙ = AX representation
in the four-dimensional Minkowski space with X ∈ M3+1, which holds the cone condition
XTgX = 0, where g is a Minkowski metric with signature 2. Suppose that X1(t) and X2(t)
are two solutions of X˙ = AX, then XT1 (t)gX2(t) is an invariance.
8
On the other hand, integrating by part we obtain
∫ t
0
XT2 (ξ)gX˙1(ξ)dξ = X
T
2 gX1
∣∣t
0
−
∫ t
0
XT1 (ξ)gX˙2(ξ)dξ. (63)
Comparing Eqs. (61) and (63) leads to
XT2 (t)gX1(t) = X
T
2 (0)gX1(0), (64)
which means that XT1 gX2 = X
T
2 gX1 is an invariance of the system. 
The theorem manifests that a state of m on the sphere ‖m‖ = 1 corresponds to an
augmented state X on the right circular cone { X | XTgX = 0} emanating from X = 0 of
the Minkowski space. In addition, as a consequence of Eq. (64) we can prove that
m1(t) ·m2(t) = 1 +
m1(0) ·m2(0)− 1
X01 (t)X
0
2 (t)
, (65)
when insert Eq. (54) for X and Eq. (58) for g into Eq. (64). Since S is not a decreasing
function of t as shown in Eq. (36), both X01 and X
0
2 defined by Eq. (50) tend to infinite.
Therefore, from Eq. (65) it follows that
lim
t→∞
m1(t) ·m2(t) = 1. (66)
When taking ‖m1(t)‖ = ‖m2(t)‖ = 1 into account, the above equation means that the
magnetization orientations align to the same direction independent on the initial orientations.
Because A is an element of the real Lie algebra so(3, 1) as shown in Eq. (62), the gener-
ated transformation G corresponding to A is an element of the proper orthochronous Lorentz
group SOo(3, 1). Liu (2004) has employed the above symmetry into a numerical solution of
the Landau-Lifshitz equation, and found that the new numerical method is stable, robust,
accurate and preserving the manifold invariant.
5 Lie-Poisson bracket formulation
For the undamped case, i.e., α = 0, of the Landau-Lifshitz equation we have mentioned in
Section 1 that Bloch et al. [13] have given a Lie-Poisson system description by viewing S as
a generator; see also the discussions by Gilbert (1955) and Frank (2004). However, for the
most applications in micromagnetics of the damped Landau-Lifshitz equation there doesn’t
yet have a Lie-Poisson system description. In this section we construct a Lie-Poisson bracket
formulation of the Landau-Lifshitz equation, stressing the coadjoint orbit invariant behavior
of this equation.
Equation (48) can be written as
m˙R = J∇H, (67)
where
H =
α
2
‖mR‖2 =
α
2
‖m‖2 (68)
is an invariant function of the system as a generalized Hamiltonian function, and
J = HR ⊗mR −mR ⊗HR (69)
10
As supposed {fk, k = 1, 2, 3} is a basis for the Lie algebra G and then we have
(ad fi)fj = C
k
ijfk. (77)
Therefore the matrix associated with the transformation ad fi is
(Mi)jk = C
j
ik. (78)
Corresponding to the structure constants given in Eqs. (72)-(74), the following Mi are avail-
able:
M1 =




The above {Mk, k = 1, 2, 3} indeed forms a matrix basis for the Lie algebra G and satisfies
Eq. (75), because the Lie brackets of Mk, k = 1, 2, 3, satisfy
[M1,M2] =

Let us consider the Lie group Gi generated from the matrix Mi:
G˙i = MiGi, Gi(0) = I3, i not summed. (85)
We can solve the above Gi:
G1 =




 , (86)
12
Therefore the matrix associated with the transformation ad∗fi is
(M∗i )jk = −C
i
jk. (98)
Since Cijk is a skew-symmetric matrix for each i, the corresponding coadjoint action is found
to be a three-dimensional rotation group denoted by SO(3).
Given an initial point mR(0) on the invariant manifold, a solution to the Landau-Lifshitz
Eq. (48) stays on the same coadjoint orbit O
mR(0) for all time. Along the coadjoint orbit the
generalized Hamiltonian function H defined by Eq. (68) is a constant.
Observing Eq. (69) we can see that the rank of J is one when mR and HR are linearly
dependent, and two when mR and HR are linearly independent. Because the rank of J is
smaller than 3, J is degenerate. For this case we have mentioned in Section 1 that there
exists at least one Casimir function of the Landau-Lifshitz Eq. (48). However, this is not
true for the Landau-Lifshitz equation. We demonstrate it below.
Suppose that there exists a function C, and its gradient is
∇C =


Therefore, the Lie-Poisson bracket of such C with any differentiable function F is zero, that
is, {C, F} = 0. By definition if such C exists it seems a Casimir function. However, Eq. (99)
can be expressed as
∇C =


0 −HR3 H
R
2
HR3 0 −H
R





mR1
mR2
mR3

 , (101)
and we can see that it is impossible to have a function that its gradient is the multiplication
of a skew-symmetric matrix with the vector mR = (mR1 , m
R
2 , m
R
2 )
T. Thus, we conclude that
for the Landau-Lifshitz equation (22) there has no Casimir function even the rank of J is
smaller than the dimensions 3. 
The above statement seems to contradict to the statement about the Lie-Poisson system.
However, the premise of this statement holds is that the state point x is a regular point. But
for the Landau-Lifshitz equation the state point mR is a singular point in the manifold.

‖ξ‖˙λ= ξ0˙λ. (8)
There appear three material constants of ke, kb and ξ0 in
this material model.
The boldfaced e, ee, ep, s, ξ and α are respectively the
five-dimensional vectors of strains, elastic strains, plas-
tic strains, stresses, active stresses and back stresses,
whereas λ is a scalar called the equivalent plastic strain,
with ξ0˙λ being the specific power dissipation.
The concept of internal spacetime as advocated by Hong
and Liu (1999a, 1999b, 2000) to model materials’ plas-
tic behaviors bears certain similarities with the external
spacetime structure originated from the Einstein’s land-
mark theory of special relativity (Hong and Liu, 2001).
Both spacetimes are flat Minkowski spaces and the action
groups are both of the Lorentz types, but with different
dimensions.
Recent studies indicate that materials’ internal spacetime
due to isotropic hardening (Liu, 2003) or anisotropy (Liu,
2004c; Liu and Chang, 2005) cannot be flattened into a
flat one. In addition, there is a third possibility to cause a
curved internal spacetime due to an external stress-strain
mixed-control imposing on materials. A common lan-
guage to describe the curved spacetimes is a mathemat-
ical theory of pseudo-Riemann manifold. Essentially,
the pseudo-Riemann manifold is a differentiable man-
ifold equipped with a non-degenerate and non-positive
metric tensor (Lang, 1999). Because the metric tensor
is non-constant, the resulting spacetime is also non-flat.
To demonstrate the third mechanism to cause the non-
flatness of internal spacetime, the material elastoplas-
tic model with Prager’s kinematic hardening is a good
choice, because this model allows stress-strain mixed-
controls and the yield surface is always constant in the
active stress space without considering isotropic hard-
ening and anisotropy. Therefore, the latter two reasons
to cause the non-flatness of internal spacetime just men-
tioned above can be ruled out, and we can concentrate
our study on the third reason of mixed-control to cause
the non-flatness of internal spacetime.
In this paper we analyze the above rate-form constitu-
tive equations under strain-control in Section 2, stress-
control in Section 3, and then stress-strain mixed-control
in all subsequent sections. In Section 4 we derive a mixed
stress-strain control equation. In Section 5 we propose
a two integrating factors method to quasi-linearize the
mixed stress-strain control equation, where the twin-cone
structure and the symmetry group in a product space of
M
m+1⊗Mn+1 are discussed, and then a group-preserving
scheme is derived. In Section 6 we use an integrating fac-
tor idea to form the constitutive equations under mixed-
control in a pseudo-Riemann manifold, and then a con-
sistent numerical scheme is developed. In Section 7 we
derive a radial return method to integrate the constitutive
equations under mixed-control. Section 8 demonstrates
the performance of these numerical schemes by numer-
ical examples. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section
9. This paper may provide us a deeper understanding of
the underlying structure of an elastoplastic model with
Prager’s kinematic hardening under mixed-controls.
2 Exact linearization under strain control
2.1 Expressed the responses in terms of ξ
From Eqs. (1)-(3) and (5) it follows that
1
ke
s˙+
1
kb
(s˙− ˙ξ) = e˙, (9)
1
ke
(˙ξ+α˙)+ 1kb α˙ = e˙, (10)
˙ξ+kb e˙p = ke(e˙− e˙p). (11)
Once ξ(t) can be obtained, it is easy to compute s(t),α(t)
and ep(t) via the following formulae (Liu, 2002):
s(t) = s(ti)+β[ξ(t)−ξ(ti)]+βkb[e(t)−e(ti)], (12)
α(t) =α(ti)+(1−β)[ξ(ti)−ξ(t)]+βkb[e(t)−e(ti)],(13)
ep(t) = ep(ti)+
1
ke +kb
[ξ(ti)−ξ(t)]+β[e(t)−e(ti)],(14)
where β= ke/(ke+kb). They were obtained by integrat-
ing Eqs. (9)-(11). Here t is the current time and ti is an
initial time, at which the initial conditions of ξ(ti), α(ti),
ep(ti) and λ(ti) should be prescribed. The above three
equations indicate that the responses are fully determined
by ξ under strain control.

˙λ= 0 if ‖ξ‖< ξ0 or ξ · s˙≤ 0. (33)
They are switching criteria of plastic irreversibility under

It can be seen that in this augmented space of x =
(yξT,yξ0)T the governing equations are also linear.
4 Mixed stress-strain control equation
To properly address all kinds of controls we define the
control path by
u := kePee+Pss, (38)
where Pe and Ps are the second-order tensors which are
disjoint projection operators, namely,
PePe = Pe, (39)
PsPs = Ps, (40)
Pe+Ps = I5, (41)
PePs = PsPe = 05. (42)
Pe can be represented by a diagonal matrix with (Naylor
and Sell, 1982)
Pe =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
λ1 0 0 0 0
0 λ2 0 0 0
0 0 λ3 0 0
0 0 0 λ4 0
0 0 0 0 λ5
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦ , (43)
where the elements λi, i = 1, . . .,5, are either 0 or 1. In
the later the abbreviation of Pe = diag [λ1,λ2,λ3,λ4,λ5]
will be used.
Multiplying Eq. (15) by Pe we obtain
Pe ˙ξ+ (ke +kb)˙λξ0 P
eξ = kePee˙. (44)
Similarly, multiplying Eq. (25) by Ps we obtain
Ps ˙ξ+ kb˙λξ0 P
sξ = Pss˙. (45)
Then, the sum of these two resultants yields
˙ξ+ (ke +kb)
˙λ
ξ0 P
eξ+ kb˙λξ0 P
sξ = u˙. (46)
Substituting Ps = I5 −Pe into the left-hand side of the
above equation, and inserting it for ˙ξ into the consistency
condition ξ · ˙ξ = 0, leads to
Hm˙λ = ξ · u˙, (47)
where
Hm :=
ke
ξ0ξ ·P
eξ+kbξ0 (48)
is the stability function for stress-strain mixed-control
equation.
Supposing Hm > 0, from Eq. (47) we can deduce the fol-
lowing on-off switching criteria of plastic irreversibility:
˙λ= ξ · u˙
Hm
> 0 if ‖ξ‖= ξ0 and ξ · u˙ > 0, (49)
˙λ= 0 if ‖ξ‖< ξ0 or ξ · u˙ ≤ 0. (50)
In the on phase of the switch, ˙λ > 0, the mechanism
of plastic irreversibility is working and the material ex-
hibits an elastoplastic behavior, while in the off phase of
166 Copyright c© 2006 Tech Science Press CMES, vol.12, no.3, pp.161-179, 2006
because of Pe +Ps = I5. Let
ξ2e := ξ ·Peξ, (57)
ξ2s := ξ ·Psξ, (58)
such that
ξ2e +ξ2s = ξ20 (59)
due to Eq. (56).
Multiplying Eq. (20) by Pe we obtain
d
dt (YP
eξ) = keY Pee˙. (60)
On the other hand, taking the inner product of Eq. (60)
with Peξ, and noting that
Peξ ·Peξ = ξ2e ,
Peξ ·Pe ˙ξ = ξe ˙ξe
due to Eq. (57) and (Pe)2 = Pe = (Pe)T, we obtain
d
dt (Yξe) =
ke
ξe YP
ee˙ ·Peξ. (61)
Eqs. (60) and (61) can be combined together to a quasi-
linear differential equations system:
˙Xe = AeXe (62)
with
Xe =
[
Xse
X0e
]
:=
[
Y Peξ
Yξe
]
, (63)
Ae :=
ke
ξe
[
0m Pee˙
(Pee˙)T 0
]
, (64)
where m is the dimensions of strain-controlled space.
Since Ae is slightly dependent on ξe, which is not a con-
stant but an unknown function, Eq. (62), unlike the linear
systems (23) and (36), is a quasi-linear system.
Similarly, multiplying Eq. (26) by Ps we obtain
d
dt (yP
sξ) = yPss˙. (65)
Then, taking the inner product of Eq. (65) with Psξ, and
noting that
Psξ ·Psξ = ξ2s ,
Psξ ·Ps ˙ξ = ξs ˙ξs
due to Eq. (58) and (Ps)2 = Ps = (Ps)T, we obtain
d
dt (yξs) =
1
ξs yP
ss˙ ·Psξ. (66)
Eqs. (65) and (66) can be combined together to a quasi-
linear differential equations system:
˙Xs = AsXs (67)
with
Xs =
[
Xss
X0s
]

[
yPsξ
yξs
]
, (68)
As :=
1
ξs
[
0n Pss˙
(Pss˙)T 0
]
, (69)
where n is the dimensions of stress-controlled space with
n = 5−m.
5.2 Twin-cone and symmetry groups
Both strain and stress control cases exhibit a cone struc-
ture in the augmented spaces of X and x, respectively.
From Eq. (22) we have
XTgX = ‖Xs‖2− (X0)2 = Y 2[‖ξ‖2−ξ20], (70)
where
g =
[
I5 05×1
01×5 −1
]
(71)
is a six-dimensional indefinite metric tensor. The 5+1-
dimensional vector space of augmented active stress X
endowed with the Minkowski metric g is referred to as
Minkowski spacetime denoted byM5+1.
Regarding Eqs. (70) and (6), we may distinguish two cor-
respondences:
‖ξ‖= ξ0 ⇐⇒ XTgX = 0, (72)
168 Copyright c© 2006 Tech Science Press CMES, vol.12, no.3, pp.161-179, 2006
of controlled strain, Pee˙ is constant in each time incre-
ment equal to ∆t. Unluckily, due to the presence of ξe
in Eq. (64), this is not true for matrix Ae. Therefore we
approximate the solution of Eq. (62) by considering ξe as
a constant in each single time step. Under such an addi-
tional hypothesis, the matrix Ae is constant, and so the
evolution of Eq. (62) is known to be
Xe(+1) = Ge()Xe(), (85)
where
Ge() := exp[∆tAe()]
=
⎡
⎢⎣ Im +

ξe()
)
, (87)
be() := sinh
(
ke∆t‖Pee˙()‖
ξe()
)
. (88)
A similar argument is applied to Eq. (67) with matrix As
given by Eq. (69), leading to
Xs(+1) = Gs()Xs(), (89)
where
Gs() := exp[∆tAs()]
=
⎡

)
. (92)
However, in their current forms, Eqs. (85) and (89) are
insufficient to determine the values of Peξ(+ 1) and
Psξ(+1), since from Eqs. (63) and (68) we have
Peξ(+1) = X
s
e(+1)
X0e (+1)
ξe(+1), (93)
Psξ(+1) = X
s
s(+1)
X0s (+1)
ξs(+1), (94)
and there are still two unknowns of ξe(+1) and ξs(+
1) on the right-hand sides. In order to solve this problem
we need four equations:
Y (+1)ξe(+1) = X0e (+1), (95)
y(+1)ξs(+1) = X0s (+1), (96)
ξ2e(+1)+ξ2s (+1) = ξ20, (97)
y(+1)−Y (1−β)(+1) = 0 (98)
to solve the four unknowns of ξe(+1), ξs(+1), Y (+
1) and y(+1). In above the values on right-hand sides
are all known. Eq. (95) is obtained from the last one row
in Eq. (63); Eq. (96) is obtained from the last one row
in Eq. (68); Eq. (97) is a direct result of Eq. (59); and
Eq. (98) is obtained by comparing Eq. (19) with Eq. (27).
Substituting Eq. (96) for ξs(+ 1) into Eq. (97), where
y(+1) is replaced by Y (1−β)(+1) which is further re-
placed by X0e (+1)/ξe(+1) due to Eq. (95), we obtain
F(ξe(+1)) := ξ2e(+1)
+
(X0s (+1))2
(X0e (+1))2(1−β)
ξ2(1−β)e (+1)−ξ20 = 0. (99)
Because of F(0) = −ξ20 < 0 and F(ξ0) = (X0s ( +
1))2ξ2(1−β)0 /(X0e (+1))2(1−β) > 0, there must exist a real
root of the above equation in the range of 0 < ξe(+1)<
ξ0.
Numerically solving Eq. (99) we obtain ξe(+ 1) and
then ξs(+ 1) can be obtained from Eq. (97). There-
fore, from Eq. (95) we obtain Y (+1), and from Eq. (96)
we obtain y(+ 1). Substituting these two values of
ξe(+1) and ξs(+1) into Eqs. (93) and (94) we can ob-
tain Peξ(+1) and Psξ(+1), and hence ξ(+1). Thus,
substituting ξ, Pee and Pss into Eqs. (51)-(54) we obtain
Pes, Pse, α and ep.
6 A pseudo-Riemann method
In Section 5 we have furnished a two-integrating-factor
and a twin-cone formulation for mixed-control equa-
tions, and then derived a numerical scheme to implement
it. In this section we attempt to unify the mixed-control
equations from an integrating factor method and a single-
cone formulation.

√
U() ·V()). (118)
Once Zs(m)(+1), Zs(n)(+1) and Z0(+1) are calcu-
lated from Eq. (113), Y (+1), Peξ(+1) and Psξ(+1)
can be calculated by
Y(+1) =

Peξ(+1) = Z
s(m)(+1)
Y (+1)

Psξ(+1) = Z
s(n)(+1)

. (121)
Substituting the latter two equations into Eqs. (51)-(54)
we obtain Pes(+1), Pse(+1), α(+1) and ep(+1).
From Eqs. (113), (114) and (105) we obtain[
Y (+1)Peξ(+1)
y(+1)Psξ(+1)
]
=
[
Y ()Peξ()

Y(+1)ξ0 = bz()c()Y()√U() ·V() +ξ0az()Y(), (123)
where
c() =
ke +kb
Hm()
ξ() · u˙(). (124)
Eq. (122) dividing by Eq. (123) and deleting Y() in both
the numerator and denominator we get two equations:
Peξ(+1) = ξ0W1(), (125)
Psξ(+1) = ξ0
Y−β(+1)
W2(), (126)
where
d() := ke +kbξ0Hm()‖u˙()‖

bz()√
d()
]
Pss˙()
az()ξ0 + bz()c()√d()
(129)
are all known from the previous time step.
Substituting Eqs. (125) and (126) into the yield condition
(56), and solve it for Y−β(+1) we obtain
Y−β(+1) =
√
‖W2()‖2
1−‖W1()‖2 . (130)
Once Y−β is substituted into Eqs. (125) and (126), it is
easy to check that
‖Peξ(+1)‖2 +‖Psξ(+1)‖2 = ξ20, (131)
and thus we get a consistent numerical scheme without
needing for any iterations.
7 Radial-return method
In this section we briefly discuss the radial return method
for the mixed-control case. This method requires two
steps to search a suitable increment of ∆λ(+1): the first
step is to find the trial stress state with an elastic predic-
tion, and then the second step is to correct the stress to
satisfy the consistency condition.

8 Numerical examples
In the above three sections we have derived three
schemes, namely, group preserving scheme (GPS),
pseudo-Riemann method (PRM) and radial return
method (RRM). In this section numerical examples are
used to test these three numerical schemes.
In order to assess the performances of the above three
numerical methods we employ a numerical example with
Pe = diag [1,1,0,0,0], which means that the strain con-
trol components are e1 and e2 and the stress control com-
ponents are s3, s4 and s5. In Fig. 2 the time histories of
the mixed-controlled components are plotted. In all nu-
merical calculations the material constants are fixed to
be ke = 40000 MPa, ξ0 = 400 MPa, and kb = 2000 MPa.
The time step size used is ∆t = 0.01 sec.
Since the first mixed-control path used to testing is a
piecewise linear one, of which Pee˙ and Pss˙ are constant,
we can calculate the responses in the elastic phase by
Pes(t) = Pes(ti)+ke(t− ti)Pee˙, (138)
Peξ(t) = Peξ(ti)+ke(t− ti)Pee˙, (139)

control-based responses in Fig. 4, where different types
of hysteresis loops can be seen. The left-hand figures
display prominent relaxations of responses under cyclic
stress control.
In Fig. 5 we display the errors of satisfying the con-
sistency condition. It can be seen that PRM gives al-
most zero value of the error of the consistency condi-
tion defined by ERR1 := ‖ξ‖− s0, while RRM has the
error of the consistency condition within the order of
5× 10−13. Because GPS needs a numerical solution to
obtain ξe(+1) by Eq. (99), the consistency error of GPS
is slightly larger than that of RRM and PRM within the
order of 3×10−12. Needless to say PRM is the best one
of these three numerical methods to satisfy the consis-
tency condition.
In order to give a more refined criterion to assess the per-
formance, let us introduce the following strain and stress
relative errors at a given discrete time t(m) for the above

Figure 7 : The cyclic responses under a non-proportional circular mixed-control path are plotted in (a)-(h). The
consistency error induced by PRM is plotted in (i).
Let us further consider an orientational error defined by
ERR4 :=
ξ(m) ·ξ∗(m)
ξ20
−1. (148)
Fig. 6(c) shows the orientational errors for GPS, RRM
and PRM. It can be seen that the errors of PRM and GPS
are far less than that of RRM.
Next, we consider a non-proportional loading case with
178 Copyright c© 2006 Tech Science Press CMES, vol.12, no.3, pp.161-179, 2006
M
m+1⊗Mn+1, where m and n are respectively the num-
bers of strain and stress control components.
Even though the constitutive equations are highly nonlin-
ear under mixed-controls, through an integrating factor
and a single cone structure they can be converted to a Lie
type system ˙Z = CZ in the 5+1-dimensional augmented
stress space of Z. In the augmented stress space an
internal spacetime structure of the pseudo-Riemannian
type is brought out. The control tensor C for the plastic
phase was proved to be an element of the real Lie alge-
bra sl(5,1,R) of the special orthochronous pseudo-linear
group SL(5,1,R). In addition the material hardening and
anisotropy, which cause the internal spacetime non-flat,
this study has also shown that the mechanism of mixed-
control may cause the non-flatness of internal spacetime.
According to these symmetry studies, numerical schemes
which preserve the group properties for every time incre-
ment were developed. These group preserving schemes
may be specifically called consistent schemes, since they
are capable of updating the stress point to be located on
the yield surface at the end of each time increment in the
plastic phase. Especially, the PRM algorithm is the best
one, which updates stress point on the yield surface with-
out needing for any iterations.
Numerical examples were used to assess the performance
of the new algorithms. In terms of the errors by satisfying
the consistency condition, strain and stress relative errors
and the orientational errors, we have shown that the new
algorithm of PRM provided good accuracy.
