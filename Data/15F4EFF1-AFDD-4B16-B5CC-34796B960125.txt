Abstract- The main goal of the research is to develop a
monowheeled vehicle and the secondary goal is to build a
solar-celled sailplane in terms of the monowheeler. This
paper, focused on the main goal, describes the hardware of
a wheel module, a platform module and a control module
together with its software modeling and simulation. The
analysis reveals that there are two MIMO systems, one is
the control loop of wheel position and platform pitch, and
the other is the control loop of platform roll and heading.
Simulation results also point out that the LQR approach
improves the eigen structure of the monowheeled system.
I. INTRODUCTION
The innovation of autopilot monowheeled vehicles
(hereafter called “momowheeler”) is excited by the traded
commodity of“Segwaybywheeled scooter”on sale since 2004
as shown in Fig.1. For energy saving, the two wheels of
Segway bywheeled scooter might be replaced by just one
wheel as studied in this paper. The main goal of the research is
to develop a monowheeler to be used in regional transportation
for a single driver. The secondary goal of the research is to
develop a solar-celled sailplane in terms of the monowheeler
by mounting wing frames to its platform.
Fig. 2 shows the first patent of monowheeler driven by
engine-power in 1924 in France. As shown, there is a platform
stabilized in level independent of wheel tilting in rolling. Based
on the design concept of Fig.1and Fig. 2, a conceptual design
to meet the main goal is formalized as given in Fig. 3(a)
together with its commercialized prototyping scheme in Fig.
3(b). Another more fantastic conceptual design to the
secondary goal is configured as given in Fig. 4. To reach the
goals, the whole scope of work concerning the research is thus
divided into two phases, i.e. phase I and phase II. Phase I takes
two years dealing with the whole designing work focusing on
the main goal and Phase II takes one more year dealing with
the whole designing work focusing on the secondary goal.
This paper is associated with the former part of the phase I.
Section II begins with a hardware design configuration on
which the following modeling is to be based. The preliminary
monowheeler hardware is basically composed of a wheel
module, a platform module and a control module. The
functions of each module are described to meet the necessity of
the main goal of a monowheeler performance.
Section III gives the software regarding the modeling and
control approaches. The modeling, a kind of innovation,
consists in wheel driving, pitch control, rolling control and
heading control. Preceding researches on vehicle control
technology are classified to 13 categories, i.e. 1) PID methods
of angular control applied to Lego competition [1] 2)
Suspension control.[2]-[10] 3) Path control [20]-[24] 4) Lateral
control [25]-[29] 5) Laboratory test [30]-[34] 6) Control
technology [35]-[41] 7) Gyro sensing [42]-[44] & [47] -[49] 8)
Vehicle dynamics [45] 9) Laser imaging [46] 10) Inertial
navigation[50]-[53] 11) GPS technology [54] - [59] 12) Auto-
pilot technology[60] -[69] 13)Estimation technology[70].
Section IV simulation and results reveals the feasibility of
implementation. MATLAB and its Simulink tool box are
employed in the simulation.
Section IV gives a data digest that summarizes the
associative data in the modeling and simulation.

III. MODELING
A. Control of Wheel Position and Platform Pitch
The monowheeler, composed of wheel module and platform
can be regarded as a two-body system as if it were a robot arm
with platform acting like a manipulator. Basically, the control
inputs to the wheel module and platform are 1) wheel motor
torque mτ2) platform balancing arm pr (proportional to
torque pτ). The desired outputs are the wheel position wx (say
20km) and the platform pitch attitude p (say 0o, i.e. in
horizontal level). That is to say, the reference is R=[ wx , p ]T .
Therefore the system of the wheel module and platform is of
MIMO system. Prior to the modeling, the free-body analysis of
two-body dynamics is necessary. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show free
bodies of wheel module and platform respectively. Fig. 8(c)
shows the attitude coordinates of pitch, roll and heading. In
general, the attitude of the platform is to be kept in horizontal
level regardless of tilting in pitch and roll similar to
an inverted pendulum.

Assuming that there is no sliding at the wheel center, we
have simplified equations of motion for the wheel module from
Fig. 8(a):

where pwF : Normal reaction force from the ground, wm :
Weight of wheel module, N: Normal mutual reaction force
between the wheel and the platform, gF :Ground friction, bF :
Bearing viscosity, wF : Ground contact thrust generated from
motor torque, wI : Moment of inertia of wheel module.
Note that the aerodynamic lift and drag on the surface of the
platform are temporary neglected and might be estimated in
further study. We also have simplified equations of motion
for the platform
from Fig. 8 (b):

Taking the moment along the wheel center we have

Combing Eq. (5), (7) and (12), it follows
ppppww freθθbθdθbθc   (13)
6This is a concept of bank-to-turn in spacecraft. But there is still
a problem that Eq. (30) with one equation and two variables
)(sθR and )(sH will lead to infinite solutions. Theoretically
it is necessary to add on another moment equation along the
heading axis, i.e. to add on a rudder-like surface so as to
generate a torque along the heading axis. In this way, the
angular momentum is able to rotate along the heading axis.
Since this idea will cause more budget requirement and
engineering complexity, Eq. (30) will be applied to roughly
meet the control objective at the present phase.

Since the system has full-states feedback, LQR design is
employed. The Matlab simulation program is listed as follows.
A = [0 1 0 0;0 -0.005 0 -0.005;0 0 0 1;0 -0.001 -15.05 -
0.001]; p=eig(A);B = [0 0; 0.9866 0;0 0;-0.48 94.1];C = [0.32

T, X0,'zoh'); plot(T,X);legend('Wheel','Wheel rate', 'Platform',
'Platform rate').
The simulation result shows that the open-loop poles are
po= 0, -0.0050, -0.0005 + j3.8794, -0.0005 - j3.8794 (33)
The gain is

The closed-loop poles are
pc= -9.4059 +j10.1745, -9.4059 -j10.1745,
-0.7024 + j0.7023, -0.7024 - j0.7023 (35)
It is obvious that the poles of open loop in Eq. (33) show less
damping with natural frequency at 3.8794. However the poles
of closed loop in Eq. (35) show more satisfied damping ξ=0.7.
B. Control of Platform Roll and Heading
The platform makes sacrifices of roll to generate torque
along the longitudinal axis and thus rotates angular momentum
clockwise or counter clockwise nearly in the level plane, in
other words, drives the wheel to the right or to the left. But this
type of design also tilts angular momentum toward the ground.
Therefore it will be more effective to apply a rudder-like
surface at the tail end of the platform so that it may cause
torque along the heading axis and pull the angular momentum
upward again to maintain the platform and the angular
momentum to the level. It takes time for the engineering design
and further theoretical analysis and thus will be left to the
second phase.

V. CONCLUSION
This paper, focused on the main goal of studying an
autopilot monowheeler, describes the hardware of a wheel
module, a platform module and a control module together with
its software modeling and simulation. The analysis reveals that
there are two MIMO systems, one is the control loop of wheel
position and platform pitch, and the other is the control loop of
platform roll and heading. Simulation results also point out that
the LQR approach improves a lot the eigen structure of the
monowheeled system. Therefore the control of wheel position
and platform pitch has fast response and appropriate damping.
This result will be helpful for the next phase to further study.
