been applied to video encryption. 
    Based on the REC/RPB scheme, 
this project proposes a multiple security 
chaos-based encryption/decryption 
scheme in which users can select three 
different security levels according to 
their demands. We analyzed the key 
space size、stream period、randomness as 
well as correlation to enhance the 
performance of a key generator. In our 
proposed scheme, a chaos-based stream 
cipher instead of the MD5 hash function 
was used as the key stream generator. 
Since the chaos-based stream cipher can 
output keystream of arbitrary length, our 
proposed system has the advantage that 
it does not waste extra keystream on 
encryption. 
    The proposed multiple security 
chaos-based encryption scheme was 
tested on video data and the results show 
that the encrypted image’s PSNR is 
below 8 dB, the time spent on 
encryption with low security level 、
medium security level and high security 
level is 3.78%、4.71% and 14.43% of the 
total computation time respectively (the 
encryption time by encrypting the 
entropy encoder’s output is 19.72% of 
the total computation time). The 
low-level encryption can withstand 
ciphertext-only attacks, the 
medium-level encryption can withstand 
ciphertext-only attacks、known plaintext 
attacks and chosen plaintext attacks, and 
the high-level encryption security is 
more secure than the medium-level 
encryption. 
 
一. 緣由與目的 
Image and video encryption play an 
important role in today’s multimedia 
world.The usage of chaotic map for 
encryption purpose is now well known 
[18, 19]. The main reason is due to the 
following characteristics of chaos [5, 9]: 
1). pseudo-randomness generated by 
deterministic equations. 2). sensitivity to 
the initial-value and parameters. What’s 
more, generation of chaotic signals is 
often of low cost. Thus chaotic signals 
are suitable for the encryption of large 
volume data. 
    Basically, there are two typical 
ways to use chaos in image/video 
encryption ; 1).use chaos as a source to 
generate pseudo-random bits with 
desired statistical properties to realize 
secret encryption operations, 2). use 2-D 
chaotic maps (or fractal-like curves) to 
realize secret permutations of digital 
images/frames. The first way has been 
widely used to design chaotic stream 
ciphers whose structure is simpler and 
faster. Format compliant means that the 
encrypted video stream is still decodable 
at the receiver end without the 
knowledge about the decryption key 
[25]. To achieve transparency, the 
encryption procedure should not destroy 
the syntax structure of the encrypted 
video stream. A format compliant 
encryption system would keep many 
carefully designed and desired 
properties of unprotected compressed bit 
stream, such as error resiliency and 
function was used as the key stream 
generator. The proposed RPB encryption 
algorithm is different from [32]. The 
reason is that the chaos-based stream 
cipher can output keystream of arbitrary 
length. The advantage is that it does not 
waste extra keystream on encryption. 
We proposed to design a three level 
security encryption scheme. Users can 
according to their demands select three 
different security level encryption 
scheme. For example, low security 
encryption scheme can be used to secure 
pay-per-view video and video lectures, 
or to prevent children from watching 
adults movies, etc. This application does 
not belong to confidential application 
and requires cost reduction. While, high 
security encryption scheme can be used 
to secure confidential video 
conferencing, medical and military 
videoing systems that require reliable 
security in storage and transmission of 
digital videos. The proposed 
chaos-based multiple security encryption 
scheme is as shown in Fig. 1. 
 
Fig. 1 The proposed chaos-based multiple 
security REC/RPB encryption scheme 
In Fig. 1, the box “Compression 
before entropy coding” represents all 
operations before entropy coding, 
including motion compensation, motion 
estimation, DCT transform, quantization, 
and so forth. Its output are symbols in 
security improved compared with the 
low security encryption scheme. The 
sign bits were encrypted using the 
chaotic encryption module 1 and the 
INTRA DC was encrypted using the 
chaotic encryption module 2 as shown in 
Fig. 3. 
 Fig. 3 Chaotic encryption module 2. 
The medium security encryption 
scheme use the chaos-based REC/RPB 
to encrypt intra DC value instead of 
randomly changing the sign bits of 
differential values of DC coefficients of 
intra block. Added to this, randomly 
changing the sign bits of AC coefficients 
of intra block, the sign bits of 
differential values of motion vectors in 
B and P frames can also be randomly 
changed. The security is improved 
compared with the low security 
encryption scheme. The first point to 
notice is the chaos-based REC/RPB 
security is dependent on the size 
of .M 1 2 3M m m m  where 
im ( 1, 2i   ) are all the DC coefficients. 
Take 50 frames with resolution 176*144 
for example, it has 4982 intra DC values 
and average bit number of DC value is 6. 
The size of M  4982 6 29892  (bits) 
is too large to withstand the classic 
birthday attack as mentioned above in 
the security analysis of the chaos-based 
REC/RPB encryption scheme. Because 
the expected number of trials before a 
collision is met is 
2989229892 1 2 2(2 ) 2 . 
Additionally, changing the sign bits of 
AC coefficients of DCT makes 
cryptanalysts not be able to use AC 
coefficients to derive DC coefficients. 
    The high security encryption 
encrypts intra DC value, intra AC value 
and motion vector sign bit. The sign bits 
were encrypted using the chaotic 
encryption module 1 and the DC and AC 
values were encrypted using the chaotic 
encryption module 2. The high security 
encryption scheme can be used for 
secure confidential video conferencing, 
medical and military videoing systems 
that require reliable security in storage 
and transmission of digital videos. The 
high security encryption scheme uses the 
chaos-based REC/RPB to encrypt AC 
values instead of randomly changing the 
encryption

As can be seen, the proposed 
scheme makes the encrypted content 
unintelligible. To measure the quality of 
the encrypted content, the peak 
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is 
calculated. Assume we are given a 
source image f that contains h by w 
pixels and a reconstructed 
image F where F is reconstructed by 
decoding the encoded version of f . First 
you compute the mean squared error 
(MSE) of the reconstructed image as 
follows

For color images with three RGB 
values per pixel, the definition of PSNR 
is the same except the MSE is the sum 
over all squared value differences 
divided by image size and by three. 
Generally, the encrypted content’s PSNR 
is often no bigger than 8 dB. Thus, the 
proposed scheme is of high perceptual 
security as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 8.

with low security scheme, medium security

From Table 2 we can see that 
relative time spent on the encryption is 
very small. We found that the time spent 
on encryption with low security 
encryption scheme, medium security 
encryption scheme, and high security 
encryption scheme during the video 
compression process is only 3.78%, 
4.71% and 14.43% of the total 
computation time respectively. While, 
we found that the encryption time with 
encrypted all entropy encoder output 
during the video compression process is 
19.72% of the total computation time 
which is higher than 3.78%, 4.71% and 
14.43%. Hence, software 
implementation of our encryption 
scheme is fast enough to secure 
multimedia in real-time multimedia 
applications. 
    As shown in Table 4, several video 
sequences of commonly used video test 
sequences are used to compare the 
compression performance of our high 
security encryption scheme with that of 
the original MPEG-2 encoder. For some 
images, the original encoder provides a 
smaller compressed data size. However, 
for some others, our high security 
scheme is better. The overall 
compression performance of our high 
security scheme is approximately the 
same as that of the original Huffman 
coding.
