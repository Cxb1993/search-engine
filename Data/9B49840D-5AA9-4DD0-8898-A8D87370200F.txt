Shan-Huen Huang, Ta-Hui Yang and Ching-Hui Tang. Fleet size determination for a truckload distribution center, 
JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION, (accepted), DOI: 10.1002/atr.1180 
1. Introduction 
 
To determine the fleet size of a distribution center is one of the most important issues in both the planning and 
operational stages for a supply chain. Overestimation of fleet size can result in idling and, on the contrary, 
underestimation of fleet size will cause service quality deterioration. Both of them are going to increase the 
cost of logistics. It is sophisticated on determining the fleet size for a distribution center. Most of the 
researches relating to the fleet size determination in the literature are accompanied with the Vehicle Routing 
Problem (VRP). For example, Repoussis et al. (2010) investigate the problem of fleet size and vehicle routing 
problem with time windows and solve it by Adaptive Memory Programming. Similarly, Renaud et al. (2002) 
analyze the fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem and solve it by a sweep-based algorithm. Other many 
VRP related researches have the fleet size being one of the objectives, such as Donati et al. (2008). It is 
definitely correct that the fleet size determination and the vehicle routing problem are highly correlated.  
 
In this paper, the bulk-cargo vehicle-dispatching problem is taken into account. This problem differs from the 
VRP-related problem in which it considers the demand for a customer is much more than a vehicle’s capacity. 
The vehicles are transporting forward and backward between depot and customers without serving 
multi-customers in a route. This kind of case is primarily happened in the upper stream of the supply chain, 
such as the delivery of raw materials, grain, concrete, or steel. There are some related works in the literature 
such as Naso et al. (2007) who solves the distribution problem of ready-mixed concrete using Genetic 
Algorithms. Similarly, Srichandum et al. (2010) resolve the dispatching problem for ready mixed concrete 
using Bee Colony Optimization. Moreover, Yan et al. (2008) analyze the scheduling and dispatching of ready 
mixed concrete by formulated it as a mixed integer network flow problem. Furthermore, Lin et al. (2010) 
consider the demand postponement and weight limit regulation as well as the time windows constraints of the 
ready mixed concrete dispatching problem. All the works tackle the vehicle dispatching problem in which a 
customer requiring services more than one vehicle delivery. This problem is analyzed in this research using 
different approach which is the Genetic Algorithm and Cutting Stock Problem. The rest of this research is 
arranged as follows. Section 2 depicts the problem definition and provides the mathematics programming and 
problem transformation. Section 3 introduces the methodologies used and explain how the methods applying 
on the problem. Section 4 defines the experiments and lists the output results. The conclusions and 
contributions are discussed in section 5. 
2. Problem description 
 
Assume node O represents a distribution center in a network and node set M represents customers 
geographically dispersed around O as shown in Figure 1(a). Each customer requests a certain amount of 
demand, denoted as dj and Mj∈ . Let K indicates the set of trucks and each truck has capacity Q. In this 
problem, the demand of node j is basically larger than Q, which means dj >>Q. Each truck’s working time for 
one day is restricted to H hours. The objective is to find the best deployment of fleet-size and the delivery 
sequences for each truck.  
The objective of the problem is to minimize the total vehicle needed to serve all the customers. This problem 
can be re-described as follows. There are ∑ 

m trips to be accomplished and how many trucks are 
needed to satisfy them. Figure 1 illustrates the deployment of truck working time that shows each truck has 
finite working time to accommodate several trips. It can be observed that each truck has same working time H 
and it is divided into several segments. A trip includes the forward and backward traverse and the service and 
restocking. The time for a complete trip is denoted as wj. Truck working time H comprises several trips in one 
day as shown in Figure 1(b). This problem is equivalent to a one-dimensional cutting stock problem (1DCSP). 
A cutting stock problem is an integer linear programming problem and it can be described as follows. Given a

 GA 
In this research, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the fleet size determination problem. GA is 
a stochastic optimization technique that mimics the process of natural evolution, which was developed by 
John Holland in 1975. The following sections explain how the GA apply on the fleet size determination 
problem. 
 
3.1 Gene representation 
There are a total of m trips required in the problem as mentioned before. A chromosome is represented by a 
string of m umbers consisting of a permutation of the m trips. The order of the trip numbers are also the 
sequence of trips conducted. To calculate the number of trucks needed, the trip travel time is added one by one 
from the very beginning of the chromosome. The maximum number of trips without exceeding the truck 
working time H constitutes a truck’s route. Repeat the process to the end of the chromosome can determine 
the number of trucks needed. The fitness value f of this problem can be simply defined as the reciprocal of the 
number of trucks needed. Figure 2 demonstrates a chromosome and the number of trucks needed to serve all 
the customers. Each truck’s working time is confined to H.

3.2 Selection 
The scheme to approach optimum of GA is select two chromosomes to reproduce offspring. Generally, 
chromosomes with larger fitness value have higher probability to be selected for reproducing next generation. 
The roulette-wheel selection method is adopted in this research and the probability of each chromosome to be 
selected is as follows.

  where fi denotes the fitness value of chromosome k. 
 
3.3 Reproduction 
There are two basic operations to reproduce the new chromosomes for the next generation, which are 
crossover and mutation. The crossover process for this research is described as follows which is appropriate 
for the permutation encoding. 
 
1. Select two chromosomes A and B as shown in Figure 3 according to the roulette-wheel selection method 
mentioned above. In addition, create strings A’ and B’ with the same length as A.  
2. Fill up A’ by 0 and 1 that generated randomly with evenly distribution.  
3. Find the positions with number 1 at A’ then obtain the numbers from exactly the same position of A. Find 
these numbers at B then fill 0s at corresponding positions in B’. For example, the first 1 in A’ projects to 
9 in A. Find 9 at B them fill the corresponding position in B’ with 0. After fill all 0s, other positions in B’ 
filled with 1. 
4. Create two strings with same length to A marked as C and C’. Check the numbers in A at which its 
corresponding position at A’ is 0. Copy the number from A to C sequentially. Copy the number in B at 
which its corresponding position at B’ is 0 followed. This would form the string C as a chromosome 
which is known the offspring of A and B. Similarly, collect the nodes projected by 1 with the same 
procedure can obtain another chromosome C’. 
5. Pick C or C’ with higher fitness value as the offspring. 
 
In order to avoid stocking in the local minimum, the mechanism mutation is developed to provide a chance to

using an interpretation of relations between orders in patterns as a graph. Belov and Scheithauer combines 
Chvatal–Gomory cutting planes with column generation and apply it onto the case of multiple stock lengths in 
the one-dimensional cutting stock problem. Yanasse et al. (2006) propose a hybrid procedure to obtain a 
reduced number of different patters in cutting stock problems. Correspondingly, McDiarmid (1999) analyzed 
the pattern minimization problem and suggested an approach for heuristic methods involving searching for 
balanced subsets. Suliman (2001) developed a pattern generation method using a search tree to mitigate the 
effect of the number of cutting patterns.

A set of solution obtained by GA in this research can be treated as a feasible set of pattern. That means having 
this feasible set of pattern as input patters can solve a cutting stock problem. It is easy to have millions or 
billions of patterns for a middle size of problem. The method symbolized by GA+CS employed the solution 
gained by GA as the input patterns to solve this 1DCSP problem. A solving procedure coded in optimization 
software GAMS according to the mathematics program described in equations (1) ~ (3) is designed to resolve

The lower bounds (LB) of the problem set WOTW are calculated to verify the solution quality. The lower 
bound of fleet size needed can be calculated simply by assuming one vehicle can serve only one customer 
only. Thus, the lower bound of fleet size for the whole problem is as follows.

It can be observed that all the output results of GA are superior to LB by 24.57% to 197.06%.  
5. Conclusions 
A problem related to fleet size determination for a truckload distribution center is presented in this study. The 
truckload distribution problem is especially important for enterprises belonging to the upper stream of a 
supply chain. The contribution made by this study is transforming and formulating the fleet size determination 
problem as a 1DCSP which has not been done in the literature. The advantage of this transformation is that the 
solution of the 1DCSP can be obtained as long as suitable patterns are available. In addition, we also develop 
a solution method, GA+CS, that combines the GA and CS techniques. The output results indicate that the GA 
method can provide good feasible solutions but that the GA+CS can significantly improve the solution quality 
gained by GA. Parametric analysis of the number of pattern sets needed is carried out to provide practical 
suggestions for realistic applications.
