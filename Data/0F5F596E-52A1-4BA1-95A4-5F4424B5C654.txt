Abstract 
Dynamic pavement performance modeling is one of the key components of pavement 
maintenance management systems based on optimal control. The purpose of a performance 
model is to predict future performance given the forecasts of external factors (e.g. traffic, weather, 
and structural design) and the maintenance strategies. Conventional linear dynamic models 
assume that maintenance effectiveness is independent of other factors when maintenance plans 
are evaluated. Other studies show that ignoring this independence would lead to biases when 
maintenance strategies are evaluated. Therefore, this study adopts non-linear state space models 
to incorporate the history of the pavement performance. Further, Extended Kalman filter is used 
to estimate the parameters of the model. The empirical example shows that the non-linear 
dynamic model captures the relationship between current pavement performance and 
maintenance effectiveness. As a result, the evaluation of maintenance strategies is improved in 
pavement maintenance management systems.

鋪面之檢測程序，包括檢測儀器及其誤差，通常檢測項目較狀態變數的數目為大( k d )，
本式在實務上的意義為，檢測儀器測量出的數據為鋪面績效的不完全資訊，但兩者之間存
在一固定的關係。為了減少校估的參數，本研究假設檢測誤差僅與儀器有關而與鋪面無關
【6】，以避免參數數目隨著鋪面數目而增加。若使用多個檢測儀器，則各儀器誤差間的關
係可由  ( t 的共變異矩陣)而瞭解，與  類似，  亦可設為對角矩陣以簡化校估過程，

如前所述，在變數、參數、及誤差項之間的關係皆限制於加法運算，為了考慮這些因

若假設其誤差項為加法運算，即可使得校估參數的模式較為簡單(見 2.4 節)。在後續實
例分析中將採用此假設，因為加法誤差項的假設在工程領域廣泛被接受，而且本研究之重

三、實例分析 
3.1 資料來源 
本研究所使用的資料為 AASHO Road Test 資料【5】，鋪面績效及其他資料(如交通量、
溫度、降雨)皆為每兩星期進行測量並完整記錄，每一鋪面區段皆有 56 組紀錄，即
56,...,3,2,1t ，例如， 1t 表示資料紀錄的時間在 1958 年 11 月 3 日，而 56t 表示資料紀
錄的時間在 1960 年 12 月 5 日，在資料庫中，每筆紀錄的日期都可以在【5】查詢的到。經
由分析所選擇的所有鋪面為 1,2,3,...,188i  ，其變數如下： 
tiZ , ：區塊 i 在時間 t 所量測的平均 PSI 值。PSI 為普遍被公認的一種測量鋪面服務品質的指

其中，SV 為 slope variance(英吋)，RD 為車轍的深度(英吋)，CR 與 PA 表示裂縫與修補面(平

tix , ：鋪面績效，為區塊 i 在時間 t 的服務力(Serviceability)，該變數無法直接量測。 
iSN ：區塊 i 的 Structural Number (SN)，代表鋪面結構設計的強度，其計算考量鋪面的表層、
基層和底層厚度。柔性鋪面 SN 的計算公式為：

其中， 1D ， 2D 與 3D 分別為鋪面的表層、基層和底層厚度(英吋) (Highway Research Board，
1962)，由該式可看出表層對於鋪面結構的影響力大於其他兩者，在本例中， SN 的範圍為
0.44 到 5.66 之間。 
tiTRF , ：區塊 i 在時間 t 內的季節性加權交通載重，單位為 510  ESALs。本變數將數個導致
鋪面劣化的重要外在因素(交通載重、降雨、溫度)結合(Highway Research Board，1962)。 
tiOVR , ：為代表重鋪(overlay)的虛擬變數，即 tiOVR , {1，在時間 t 與 t+1 之間對區塊 i 進行

3.2 模式說明與校估結果 
本研究所提出的模式如式(18)與式(19)，測量方程式顯示測量值(PSI)與實際績效之間存
在隨機誤差，而在系統方程式中，本研究考慮了兩個非線性的現象：第一個是交通載重的
損害與結構設計的關係。在線性模式中，由於鋪面厚度設計與交通載重為獨立，鋪面間的
SN 值差距直接造成鋪面間的績效差異，對於交通載重無任何效果，但實際上，對於同樣的
交通載重，SN 越大(強度越強)，則鋪面績效下降的幅度應越小，反之亦然。在本研究之非
線性模式中，可假設 SN 與交通載重之間存在著非線性的關係，因此，對於鋪面績效也會
產生間接的影響，即結構厚度與單位交通量造成的損害有相關，此為較合理的假設。經過
測試，在本研究中交通對 PSI 值的影響之假設為
2
1 , 1

第二個非線性的考量為鋪面績效與維修效果間的關係。一般來說，同一維修方法多在
相同的條件(鋪面績效)下施行，但該維修方法對於其他績效下的鋪面之效果則無法得知
【7】。此一現象導致維修決策模式(如：動態規劃與最適控制)無法去評估其他可能的維修方
案。使用本研究之非線性績效模式則可考慮維修效果對於鋪面績效的相依性。其重鋪的維

因為此研究建立之方法論需要長時間的序列資料且完整的維修紀錄，本研究採用

between pedestrians and the environment. Thus, a complete procedure for evaluating 
emergency evacuation of facilities is needed.  
To evaluate the design for emergency evacuation, both the facility layout and the 
characteristics of pedestrians must be considered. The difficulties of capturing 
pedestrian dynamics are three dimensional movements and highly unpredictable 
human behaviors. Moreover, the pedestrian behaviors during evacuation are unique 
because they are relatively irrational and less intelligent. Pedestrian dynamics have 
been studied through various approaches. The problems encountered by researchers 
and practitioners are that experiments (i.e. drills) are impractical because they are 
unrealistic and expensive to repeat and observations from actual events are extremely 
rare. Since conducting a large number of experiments in order to evaluate facility 
designs is problematic, it is reasonable to create mathematical models that include 
facility design as well as pedestrian behaviors and are computationally feasible for 
the analysis. As a result, computer modeling of pedestrian evacuation has become one 
of the most promising fields for the hazard mitigation in civil engineering.   
The paper reviews the possible methods for developing pedestrian models and 
proposes an approach to calibrate simulation models for pedestrian movement with 
actual data using Cellular Automation (CA). After the pedestrian model is validated, 
it is used in a procedure that supports decision-making for facility design such as gate 
width, corridor space, and numbers of exits. In this procedure, the minimum numbers 
of repetitions to achieve a pre-determined probability for correct selections can be 
used so both accuracy and efficiency are maintained. Finally, the example of 
evaluating a transportation terminal is conducted to demonstrate the procedure.  
2. Literature Review 
In this section, related works in pedestrian dynamic, facility design, and system 
ranking are reviewed.  
1. Pedestrian Dynamics 
As Helbing (2001) stated, regression analysis, queuing models, transition matrix 
models, stochastic models, gas-kinetic theory, and fluid-dynamic were used for 
modeling pedestrian. However, for extreme situations and/or irregular spaces, a direct 
simulation of individual pedestrians is preferable due to its flexibility. The major 
approaches for pedestrian simulation, which sometimes have common features with 
each other, include Social (Behavioral) Force Model (SF) (Helbing, 2001), Cellular 
Automation (CA) (Burstedde et al., 2001), and agent-based models (Batty et al., 1998; 
Batty, 2001). In this paper CA model is adopted because it is considered simpler and 
thus faster than others. The main points of CA model will be explained briefly later 
and more complete review can be found in Schadschneider et al. (2008).   
2. Facility Design 
The typical guidelines or codes for facility design regulate the number or size of 
important specifications such as the minimal gate width and number of exits. For the 
numerical example later in this paper, the building code related to pedestrian 
evacuation in transportation terminals in Taiwan are summarized as follows:  
simplified and thus CA is beneficial when the number of pedestrians and/or 
the number of trials are large. In this study, the size of a cell is 40cm40cm 
and the walking speed is 1.5 m/sec, which determine the time interval of 
the simulation as 0.27(=0.40/1.5) seconds.  
 Static Field: The static field represents the attractiveness of locations; 
specifically, the field is calculated as the distance to the closest exit(s) in 
this paper. It follows that the static field of the exits would be zero. In the 
case of emergency evacuation, the number of destinations such as 
emergency gates is generally very small and thus the calculations for static 
field would be limited. The most significant benefit of using static field is 
that it will be calculated only once when the simulation starts and will not 
change during the simulation, which reduces the computational work. 
Examples of static fields will be displayed in the numerical example.  
 Dynamic Field: Another component used in Burstedde et al. (2001) is 
dynamic field, which represents the records of paths used by the pedestrians. 
In this study, it is the accumulated number of passing pedestrians of each 
cell and these values decay overtime. Unlike the static field, the dynamic 
field updates over time due to the transition of pedestrians in the building.  
 Friction Effect: Kirchner et al. (2003) study the effect that when pedestrians 
attempt to move into the same location, there is a probability all of the 
pedestrians give up and stay at their original locations. The phenomenon is 
called friction effect and it is incorporated in this study. However, the 
existence of this effect must be tested in the model validation.  
The floor field of a cell is the weighted combination of its static field and its 
dynamic field. As a result, pedestrians will move toward the cells with higher floor 
field values; equivalently, they will move to the closest stairways or exits and also 
follow other people’s paths. The conflicts between pedestrians are also considered by 
the friction effect. More detailed algorithm for CA models can be seen in Burstedde 
et al. (2001) and Kirchner et al. (2003).  
The experience of implementing the CA method shows the following benefits. 
First, in other methods, interaction between people occurs when two individuals are 
within a certain distance. In CA, pedestrians only interact with each other when they 
attempt to move into the same cell. It leads to reduced computation works. Second, 
the simulation is focused on the update of the floor field whose size is constant and 
does not change with the number of individuals. As a result, the effect of the number 
of pedestrians is less significant. Thus, CA method is appropriate for large-scale and 
repeated simulations.   
4. CA Model Calibration 
As observed in Schadschneider et al. (2008), many of the pedestrian models are 
constructed based on theories of human behavior, and model calibration with actual 
data is not conducted because reliable quantitative results are missing for many 
scenarios. The reasons include that the samples from actual incidents are rare, 
experiments could not reflect actual human behavior, and they are too expensive to 
conduct.   
Calibration of pedestrian models is not trivial. Although this research constructs 
The results from the first stage show that high   provides better fitting and provide 
the promising ranges of the parameter values.

Figure 2. Fundamental Diagrams Fitting for Model Calibration 
In the second stage, the search range and the increments are reduced. The 
simulation uses 0 6 1 6sJ     with the increment of 0.1, 0 6 1 6dJ     with the 
increment of 0.1, and 0 2 0 8     with the increment of 0.05. The optimal 
parameters are found to be 0 9sJ   , 0 6dJ   , and 0 8   . The comparison of 
observed and prediction is shown in Figure 2. It can be observed that the model 
reproduces density up to 2.5 adequately. The most significant differences are that 
densities over 2.5 are not produced in the simulation and the maximum simulated 
speed is slightly lower than observed maximum speed (1.4 m/s). Future research will 
current design of the station fulfills all of them. Since eight stairways are constructed 
in the current design, it is implemented as SYSTEM 8. Other 4 hypothetical designs 
that also fulfill the regulations are implemented. In SYSTEM 7, one of the two 
northwest stairways is removed. In SYSTEM 6, one of the southeast stairways is 
removed from SYSTEM 7. One of the southwest stairways is further removed from 
SYSTEM 6 as SYSTEM 5. Finally, one of the northeast stairways is removed from 
SYSTEM 5 for SYSTEM 4. SYSTEM 4-7 might be considered because of, for 
example, routine maintenance, cost saving, or stairway collapse caused by hazards 
(e.g. earthquake and fire). The simulation of SYSTEM 8 is illustrated in Figure 3.  
One of the most common pitfalls of computer simulation is to run only a single 
simulation for each alternative and make decision. When it is done, the stochastic 
nature of the system is ignored. On the other hand, too many repetitions of simulation 
are a waste of time and resources. Computer simulation literature has a great 
collection of studies in comparing and selecting systems. In this study, the goal is to 
pick the best system, which has the smallest maximum evacuation time with a 
pre-determined probability, among the alternatives of stairway configurations. The 
two-stage approach proposed by Rinott (1978) is adopted. In the first stage, a small 
number of repetitions ( 0n ) are conducted. Based on the results of the first stage, the 
necessary number of additional repetitions can be decided and thus minimal work can 
be done for the remaining simulation.   
In the study, 4,000 pedestrians are randomly distributed in the ground floor and 
B1 floor. The results for the analysis are summarized in Table 1. A relatively small 
number of initial repetitions ( 0 10n  ) is picked and the first stage mean and variance 
for all the systems are listed in the second column in the table and Figure 4. It is clear 
that the evacuation time of SYSTEM 8 is significantly smaller than others and, as 
expected, the more stairways the lower evacuation time. However, more simulation 
must be done to conduct statistical selection among the systems. The additional 
numbers of repetitions are calculated according to Rinott (1978). The general rule is 
that when the variance from the first stage is large, more repetitions are required for 
the second stage.   
Before second stage comparison is made, the decision-maker must first decide 
the indifference zone, which indicates the smallest difference that is meaningful to the 
user. Three comparisons are demonstrated here. In Comparison I, all five systems are 
candidates and the indifference zone is set to 1 second. Apparently SYSTEM 8 is the 
best system; strictly speaking, SYSTEM 8 has the smallest maximum evacuation time 
with the probability 0.90 and the difference between the second best system is at least 
1 second. In fact, the confidence interval of this difference is as large as [-28.3, -26.3] 
seconds.   
In Comparison II, only the hypothetical designs are considered. The results show 
that SYSTEM 7 is the best system with the probability 0.90. However, the difference 
between the second best system (SYSTEM 6) is [-1.7,0.3] seconds, which contains 
zero. Therefore, this difference is not statistically significant. If a larger indifference 
zone, 3 seconds, is picked initially, the best system becomes SYSTEM 6. Note that 
the required additional repetitions are smaller than those of Comparison II because of 
the larger indifference zone. Similar to Comparison II, the difference between the 
best system and the second best system is not statistically significant due to the 
6. Conclusions 
A system that compares a set of facility evacuation designs and picks the best 
from them is proposed. The system includes two major parts: a pedestrian model and 
a selection procedure. First, the cellular automation model that simulates pedestrian 
movements is implemented. Unlike other studies that do not calibrate their models at 
all or attempt to calibrate their models at microscopic level, this study calibrates the 
parameters with macroscopic equations that are widely used in practice. The results 
show that the pedestrian model reproduces the collective measures (flow, speed, and 
density) adequately and the computational effort of the model is relatively low due to 
its simplicity. Second, to account for the randomness in an emergency evacuation, 
one of the techniques in system ranking is used to select the best facility design from 
the candidate designs. The major benefit of the technique is that given the 
indifference-zone of the users and the desired probability of correct selection, the 
minimal numbers of repetitions can be determined; therefore, the problems raised by 
running too many or too few repetitions can be avoided. Further, the difference 
between the best system and the second best system can be estimated. As shown in 
the numerical example, it is possible that the difference between the best two systems 
is not statistically significant, and other considerations can be incorporated to make 
decisions.
