very convenient for people to watch TV at
anytime and anywhere when the technique is
embedded in a cellular phone. The DVB
technique can be classified into two parts. One is
DVB-T; the other is DVB-H [5-6]. In this project,
DVB-H is focused mobile communicaiton
applications. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 illustrate the
standards of some different DVB systems [7].

DMB is made from Digital Audio
Broadcasting (DAB). DMB can claasify into two
different types. One is Satellite (S-DMB); the
other is Terrestrial (T-DMB) [8]. DMB is based
on the Eureka 147 standard. At present, a lot of
countries are following the standard to develop
their own DTV technique.
MediaFLO is a new technique from
Qualcomm to broadcast data and information by
portable devices. The time division multiplexing
technique is developed by Qualcomm for
MediaFLO applications [9]. It also has the same
benefits with DVB. Otherwise, MBMS can
provide the capability between broadcasting and
multimedia services for 3 GPP applications [10].
Small physical geometry antennas will be
presented in part 2 for WiMAX, WLAN, BT,
S-DMB, and DVB-H+ applications.
2. Antenna Design
Printed antennas are very favorable
candidates for wireless terminal devices
applications by the characteristics of low-profile,
low-price, and easier fabrication [11-12]. In
order to satisfy commercial products
applications, the proposed antennas are actually
mounted on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
size of a real phone according to the Dopod
mobile telephone specifications [13]. The
material FR4 is used to be a substrate (SUB) of
the antennas of which the relative permittivity is
4.4.
A printed multi-band monopole antenna is
designed for BT of 2.4 GHz and IEEE 802.16e
WiMax of 3.5 and 5.8 GHz applications. The
impedance bandwidths of the monopole antenna
of 2.4–4.2 GHz and 5.05–5.9 GHz are covered.
It also can apply to WiFi of 2.4 - 2.5 GHz and 5 -
5.8 GHz and WLAN of 2.4 - 2.48 GHz, 5.15 -
5.35 GHz, and 5.72 - 5.83 GHz. The geometry of
the monopole antenna is shown in Fig. 3 with
the dimensions of L1 = 1.5 mm, L2 = 18.5 mm,
L3 = 17.5 mm, W1 = 0.72 mm, W2 = W3 = 2
mm, and W4 = 7.64 mm. Furthermore, the
interval between the 50-ohm feeding line and the
ground (GND) is 0.5 mm. The radiator is
mounded on the top of the SUB. The feeding
type is by using Coplanar Waveguide (CPW) due
to some good performances described in the
references [14-15].
Fig. 3: Geometry of the monopole antenna
Miniaturization of antennas by using
various dielectric materials has been reported
[16]. The material, calcium borosilicate glass
(CaO–B2O3–SiO2, CBS), is adopted to be a SUB
with some properties such as the low thermal
an radiator decreases when the resonant
frequency increases. The dimension of the GND
plane turns out some different effects [21].
Generally, as the GND length is approximately
0.4λ, the bandwidth of antenna is expected to be
enhanced.
Fig. 5 shows the geometry of the designed
PIFA radiator with the dimensions of L1 = 39
mm, L2 = 10 mm, L3 = 5.75 mm, L4 = 0.85 mm,
L5 = 10 mm, L6 = 2 mm, L7 = 21 mm, L8 = 16
mm, L9 = 9mm, L10 = 14 mm, L11 = L12 =
1mm, L13 = 100mm, W1 = 10 mm, W2 = 6.2
mm, W3 = W4 = W5 = W7 = 2 mm, W6 = 1 mm,
W8 = 40 mm. Referred to the equivalent circuit
model of [22], it shows the effects by the
coupling EM energy between radiator and
GND plane. The GND plane under the PIFA
radiator is dug a slot, the current on the plane is
forced to flow around the two parallel lines and
the current track will be increased. Therefore,
multi-band resonant frequencies are created on
the configurations.
3. Results
The far-field anechoic chamber and Vector
Network Analyzer (VNA) HP 8720C are used for
experimental measurements. Return Loss (RL)
of the first radiator of the printed monopole
antenna is shown in Fig. 6. It illustrates that the
measured bandwidths of the printed monopole
antenna are between 2.4 to 4.2 GHz and 5.05 o
5.9 GHz referred to -10 dB RL. Evidently, the
frequency bands are able to be applied to BT
(2.4 GHz), WiMax (2.5/3.5/5.5 GHz), WiFi
(2.4/5.8 GHz), and WLAN (2.4/5.2/5.8 GHz)
applications. The ratios of impedance bandwidth
of the printed monopole antenna in relation to
the central frequencies (3.3 GHz and 5.5 GHz)
are 54.5 % and 15.5 %, respectively.
The far-field radiation patterns of the
printed monopole antenna at 2.4, 3.5, 5.2, 5.5,
and 5.8 GHz are shown from Fig. 7 to Fig. 11.
The values of peak gain of the antenna on the
azimuth (H_plane) at these resonant frequencies
of 2.4, 3.5, 5.2, 5.5, and 5.8 GHz are -2.06, 0.78,
1.6, 3.07, and 1.49 dBi, respectively. The values
of peak gain of the antenna on the elevation
(E_plane) at these resonant frequencies of 2.4,
3.5, 5.2, 5.5, and 5.8 GHz are -3.1, -0.04, 3.05,
4.67, and 3.21 dBi, respectively.

The RL of the third designed radiator is
shown in Fig. 16. It illustrates that the measured
impedance bandwidth of the PIFA is 3.03 –6.04
GHz referred to -10 dB RL. Evidently, the
covered frequency bands are able to be applied
to WiMAX/WiFi/WLAN applications. The ratio
of impedance bandwidth of the PIFA in relation
to the central frequency (4.5 GHz) is 67 %.
The far-field radiation patterns of PIFA at
3.5 and 5.8 GHz are shown in Fig. 17 to Fig. 18,
respectively. The values of peak gain of the
designed antenna on the azimuth (H_plane) at
3.5 and 5.8 GHz are 2.0 and -1.2 dBi,
respectively. The values of peak gain of the
antenna on the elevation (E_plane) at 3.5 and 5.8
GHz are -3.6 and -5.0 dBi, respectively.
