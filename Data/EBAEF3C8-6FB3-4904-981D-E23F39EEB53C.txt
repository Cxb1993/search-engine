 To identify all parameters corresponding 
to cross couplings, frequency alignment, and 
source-load coupling, powerful CAD tools are 
needed. Recently, an elegant diagnosis method 
is proposed to help designing of symmetric 
coupled-resonator filters [2]. However, the 
method in [2] has not taken the source-load 
coupling into account. In this program, we 
propose a diagnosis scheme, which is 
applicable to arbitrary topologies with or 
without source-load coupling.  
 
Ⅱ. The CAD method for filter diagnosis 
    
The extraction method proposed here has 
two major steps. In the first step, we extract the 
(N+2)× (N+2) transversal coupling matrix, for 
the filter of order N, from the EM simulated 
response as Alejandro et al. have done in [3]. 
In [3], the authors apply the Cauchy method to 
get the rational polynomial approximation of 
and from the EM simulated 
results, and then generate the corresponding 
transversal coupling matrix by the method 
proposed by Cameron [1]. Extracting the 
coefficients of the rational function by Cauchy 
method is attractive since there is no need of 
calibrating the reference plane as that in [2, 4]. 
In this step, we would get the transversal 
coupling matrix like the follows (take the 
quadruplet filter for instance).

 In the second step, the transversal 
coupling matrix is transformed into the 
prescribed topology. It is known that by 
applying the multiple similar transformations 
to the coupling matrix, one can get the 
equivalent coupling matrix with the same 
electrical performance as the original coupling

should be applied.

Ⅲ. FILTER DESIGN EXAMPLES 
In this section, we will focus on development 
two novel quadruplet filters with source-load 
coupling and utilize the CAD tool introduced 
in previous section to do diagnosis of proposed 
filters. The design procedures are summarized 
as following. Follows the synthesis method 
described in [1], one would get the ideal 
coupling matrix with the topology shown in 
Fig 2. The corresponding spacing between 
every resonator is determined through the 
characterization of the couplings as described 
in chapter 8 of [10]. After EM simulation, the 
values of unwanted cross couplings are 
extracted. Fixing the values of unwanted 
couplings, the optimization technique is then 
applied to determining the required frequency 
shifts of resonators and the change of other 
coupling elements to compensate the distortion 
of |S11|. Two examples are given to show the 
design procedures. The first filter, shown in Fig. 
3, is designed to have two pairs of real 
frequency transmission zeros at normalized 
frequency for skirt selectivity. The 
second filter, shown in Fig. 6, is intended to 
have one pair of real frequency transmission 
zero at normalized frequency  for 
selectivity and another pair at  for 
in-band flap group delay. The center frequency, 
the fractional bandwidth, and the maximum 
in-band return loss of both filters are 2.4GHz, 
3.75% and 20dB respectively. The filters are 
built on a 20-mil-thick Rogers RO4003 
substrate with 
 6,2 ±±=Ω
5.4±=Ω
55.1j±=Ω
38.3=rε , 0021.0tan =δ . The 
commercial EM simulation software Sonnet 
9.0 [11] is used to perform the simulation. 
A. QUADRUPLET FILTER WITH TWO PAIR OF 
REAL FREQUENCY TRANSMISSION ZEROS 
In order to see the effect of the controlling 
line, we exclude the controlling line at first and 
adjust the quadruplet filter following the 
previously mentioned procedures. After 
extracting the unwanted diagonal cross 
couplings of the quadruplet filter and 
compensate them, we would get the EM 
simulated response shown as circles in Fig. 
5(a). Using the CAD tool developed in section 
 together with the cost function defined in Ⅲ
Eq. (6), the extracted coupling matrix M1 (with 
the value of cost function ) is 
obtained as following.

coupling where one was designed for 
quasi-elliptical and another was designed for 
flat group delay responses, were fabricated and 
the measured results agree well with that of 
theory. It has been shown that the diagnosis 
method described in this paper helps a lot to 
judge the unwanted effects in the microstrip 
quadruplet filter where these effects was 
usually very difficult to specify in microstrip’s 
open environment.
