二、英文摘要： 
A first analytical model is developed for the study of laminar film 
condensation from very slow saturated vapor onto an isothermal 
super-elliptical fin. The effects of the pressure gradient, the interfacial vapor 
shear stress, and the various super-elliptical geometrical parameters on the 
local condensate film flow are investigated in the project. Further, the above 
effects on the local and mean heat transfer coefficients are then studied. 
The Simpson numerical integration analysis in the condensation heat 
transfer under the related experimental parameters is performed for the 
various super-elliptical geometrical parameters in the present study. 
Meanwhile, the Taghavi pressure gradient theory is to study the surface 
tension effect on the condensate liquid thickness for different shape of 
super-elliptical fins, and to investigate the critical angle for the condensate 
film separated from the fin wall. The present project will make the film 
condensation theory form a complete heat transfer analysis during 
application in different shape of super-elliptical fins from the classical-shape 
“square” to various super-elliptical shapes. Besides, it will offer the fin 
designer a reference data in the future.

  超級橢圓方程式為一高階的數學方程，特色為可以依其超級橢圓參
數描繪任意取線特性，隨著X、Y及Z三軸作幾何的變化，從收縮菱型
(Pinched diamond)到菱型(Diamond)到圓型(Circular)到方型(Rectangle)，
皆可用同一方程式表示。所以本研究搭配超級橢圓方程式對於各種的幾
何外型作一系列相變化凝結熱傳研究，探討各種橢圓幾何外型對於散熱
的優缺點，因應各種不同的工作環境，改善熱傳效率，並增加研究的實
用性。 
 
(三) 文獻探討 
 
  (a) 均勻溫度分佈表面之凝結情況： 
    Dhir 與Lienhard[1]、[2]所歸納軸對稱表面，如圓管、圓球、圓錐等。
他們延續Nusselt-Roshsenow 膜狀凝結理論，將表面上重力之有效分力
表示成流線位置函數，而獲得類似垂直平板之Nusselt型態所表示之簡單
解，不但未曾考慮表面張力效應，且在其特例一圓球之平均熱傳係數值
計算，由於採用不當角度平均，因而結果失誤。Souza-Santes[3]亦針對
各種形式之連續表面，在含凝結液之加速度與對流能量等效應下，作凝
結熱傳分析，但仍不針表面曲率變化所引起之表面張力作用影響。  
Semenov[4]等人則著手研究水平非圓形剖面管外膜狀凝結熱傳遞之促
進，考慮在自然重力與表面張力雙重作用下，發展出一種最佳超幾何曲
線之曲面，可產生最佳平均凝結傳係數。其促進熱傳遞之關鍵，在於該
曲面所造成之表面張力較有利於凝結液流動，因此能促進凝結熱傳遞效
果。然而此曲線所圍成特殊剖面形狀之管，在加工製造時，量產或經濟
性而言，仍屬待克服之課題。 
4 
Sparrow 與Gregg[12]提出了加入慣性力項與能量方程式中熱對流項的
修正，但仍忽略液汽界面之黏阻力，並以數值方法求解凝結液之邊界層
方程式。其結果證實，只有當Pr 值很低的流體，如液態金屬，慣性力
的作用才顯得重要，並且忽略慣性力作用之誤差將不超過2％，故不失
為一相當可靠的方法。 
公元1961 年，Koh 等人[13]，再加入考慮液-汽介面剪應力。其計
算結果顯示，在Pr 值大於1 時，交界面剪應力的影響相當小，幾乎可
忽略，只有Pr值很小時，介面剪應力才會對凝結熱傳產生影響，此影響
造成較低的凝結熱傳係數。另外，Koh[14]亦針對介面剪應力作修正，
同時擴充至液相與汽相均考慮雙相邊界層之數值積分解析。當Pr 減小
時，汽態黏阻力將逐漸顯得重要，而且比凝結液的慣性力項對熱傳特性
更具影響力。其他尚有Chen[15]、[16]，亦以數值方法，作此方面修正
之研究，亦均獲得較接近實驗量測之理論預測值。 
除此之外，尚有針對圓管加入凝結液厚度之曲率半徑與否對凝結熱
傳特性影響之修正、此點係由Churchill[17]與Taghavi[18]分別提出。
Churchill 發現當 DNu 參數小於27 時，液膜表面之曲率效率已可明顯提
高垂直圓管外凝結熱傳效率，但對垂直圓管內凝結熱傳效率卻減少。
Taghavi 僅針對水平圓管外忽略液膜厚度之曲率半徑變化，所產生壓力
度項對熱傳特性影響。其結果顯示，在一般範圍之 Nu 參數下，考慮加入
凝結液膜厚度之曲率半徑所獲得平均熱傳係數值較高於Nusselt理論
解，兩者誤差僅在1%以內，亦即Nusselt理論之平均熱傳係數值，仍相當
正確且可靠。其他尚有Krupiczka[19]，亦考慮加入表面張力效應。他以
Nusselt 理論，加入因凝結液度對角度變化所產生之表面張力，建立一
液膜度的非線性常微分方程式，然後以Runge-Kutta 方法求解。所獲得

由於超級橢圓的高階性，目前尚無人將此方程式應用於工程的領域，所
以本研究創新將超級橢圓幾何方程式針對散熱鰭片做一完整的熱傳研
究。 
 
 (d) 有關鳍片散熱相關的研究 
在流場中加裝鳍片對整個熱流場之影響一直是學者所關注的，例如
Bunditkul和Yang [24] Tropea和Gackstatter [25]所提出單一鳍片對流場分
佈的研究，及Webb和Ramadhyani [26]所提出鳍片放置位置對流場的影響
等。此外，鳍片在製造時所形成的彎曲型、鋸齒型和使用一段時間後附
著在鳍片上之堆積物與雜物均會增加鳍片厚度而影響熱傳效率，所以實
際應用上不考慮鳍片厚度是無法完全應用在熱交換器上。因此Patankar
和Prakash [27]首先考慮了鳍片厚度對熱流場之分析，而Cur和Sparrow 
[28]也針對直線排列的八片鳍片其厚度對熱流場之影響作分析。 
 
(四) 研究方法 
    首先第一步係建立分析座標與物理模型，運用解析解法導入超級橢
圓管管形離心率，藉由此方程式來推導鰭片物理模型，並以離心率來控

第二步建立統制方程式，分成質量、動量與能量守恆等三部分方程

(2) 離心率越高之超級橢圓其平均層流凝結熱傳係數高於一般圓

加；而當n>2後，厚度是從最厚處，隨著角度增加而減少，而到
達一峰值後，隨著角度增加而增加。 
(4) 表面張力的作用在每一種幾何外型的影響不盡相同，由於曲率
半徑的變化直接影響到表面張力的大小，因此本研究發現在一

ABSTRACT—An analytical study is made into the process of heat transfer with the 
vapor condensation on a novel Superelliptical extend surface under the simultaneous 
effects of the forces of surface tension and gravity on the condensate film. Analytical 
expressions for both local condensation film thickness and heat transfer coefficient 
around the superelliptical extend surface periphery have been derived under the effects of 
gravity and surface tension for various values of ellipticity and superellipse geometric 
parameter, respectively. The dimensionless mean heat transfer coefficient – Nu  for any 
ellipticity e, superellipse geometric parameter n and various Bond numbers Bo has been 
obtained; however, it is almost unaffected by surface tension force due to surface 
curvature changing. For special objects (circular tube e = 0 and n = 2) the results are 
identical to some classical Nusselt-type solutions and Yang and Chen’s elliptical tube 
solutions.

1. INTRODUCTION 
In view of the practical importance in the design of the condensers for power plants 
and various thermal engineering processes, numerous analyses of steady laminar 
condensate film flowing under the action of gravity down an axi-symmetric body surface 
18 
curvature of the condensate-vapor interface varying along the condensing surface. 
Krupiczka [1985] first accounted for a pressure gradient term due to surface tension 
effect in film condensation on circular tubes, and concluded that this effect is actually 
negligible the mean heat transfer. Next, Semenov et al. [1990] also included the effect of 
surface tension upon laminar film condensation on a horizontal non-circular pipe. More 
recently, Yang and Chen [1993a] and [1993b] investigated effect of surface tension upon 
filmwise condensation on vertical ellipsoids and horizontal elliptical tube, respectively. 
The results also indicated that the surface tension has an appreciable influence on the 
local film thickness and heat transfer characteristics, but the effect on the mean heat 
transfer coefficient is nearly insignificant. In the above two studies, they employed a 
mathematical treatment to extend the axi-symmetric body from circular to flat plate by 
varying the ellipticity. However, the rectangle and triangle are excluded. 
Gardiner [1965] first presented a mathematical model, a superellipse system of 
coordinates and used it fitting various ellipses, cylinders, diamonds, and rectangles, etc. 
These two representations have been brought into the computer vision and graphics 
community by Barr [1981] and, in particular, Pentland [1986] who used superquadrics 
(superellipses 3D extension) to model parts of objects in a coarse but very compact way. 
This is the major motivation to attract as to investigate the filmwise condensation outside 
a superelliptical body. The purpose of this study is to unify and simplify the filmwise 
condensation analysis for all kinds of axi-symmetric bodies via the proposed superellipse 
geometric parameter n and ellipticity e. 
 
2. Mathematical Modeling and Thermal Analysis 
Consider a superelliptical wall, with major axis “a” in the direction of gravity, 
situated in a quiescent, pure vapor that is at its saturation temperature Tsat. The wall 
temperature Tw is uniform and below the saturation temperature. Thus, condensation 
occurs on the wall and a very thin continuous film of the liquid runs downward over the 
superelliptical wall under the actions of the component of gravity, which is parallel to the 
tangent of the wall surface, and of the surface tension forces. 
The physical model under consideration is shown in Fig. 1 where the curvilinear 
coordinates (x, y) are aligned along the superelliptical wall surface and its normal. Their

It is further assumed that at the interface no vapor shear is considered to exert upon the 
condensate. Thus, the boundary conditions are

It is to be note that the above relation applies to the angle from θ  = 0 to θ c (≦π ). 
The critical angle, θ c is the root of sinθ + Bo(θ ) = 0. For θ ≧θ c, since the condensate 
film layer is dripping off the tube, F(θ ) and δ  are considered as infinity. In order to 
compare with circular tube, based on the same condensing area, or the same perimeter per 
unit length of tube, one may express the film thickness in terms of equivalent diameter De

For the case of regular ellipse, n = 2, e = 0, it is noted that an ellipse becomes a 
circular. Hence, its equivalent diameter becomes De= 2π r. Here, r is a radius of a 
circular. Therefore, one should use 2r instead of De for Ra and Nu  in equation (29) and 
may obtain the same form as Nusselt’s [1916] solution, i.e.

Figs. 3. When e = 0 (circular cylinder) and e = 1 (flat plate), the condensate film profiles 
show a fairly good agreement between the Nusselt’s [1916] and Yang and Chen [1993b] 
theoretical prediction results. Note that on the top of vertical flat plate (e→1), one may 
find the film thickness approaching to zero. 
Secondly, for the case of the superellipse geometry parameter, n = 2.5, the surface 
wall approaches to a square. It is seen from Fig. 2 that the superellipse geometry becomes 
a straight contour for both near the up-stagnation point and the down-stagnation point. 
Note that the film thickness is accumulated significantly at θ  = 0. Fig. 4 demonstrates 
that the local film thickness is decreasing greatly within the very closed to the 
up-stagnation point and then slowly up to the minimum value. Next, local heat transfer 
coefficient begins to increase because the condensate film accumulates thicker enough 
and drips off. In general, the higher ellipticity is, the more significantly appreciable 
variation of surface curvature is. In other words, for the cases of higher values of e, the 
smaller θ  value is, the greater of arc length contained is. 
Finally, for the case of n = 4, superellipse geometry is quite close to a rectangle as 
shown in Fig. 2. Since the geometric surface tends to flatness for n = 4.0, the condensate 
film accumulates favorably and thickly. 
Consequently, the local film thickness is quite large in the beginning and then 
decreases as the condensate film is drawn down as shown in Figs 5. As the film flows 
behind the corner, the local heat transfer coefficient diminishes. 
 
(II). Effect of surface tension 
For the case of the superellipse geometry parameter, n = 2, the effect of the surface 
tension on the film profile is caused by the variation of radius of surface curvature, as 
illustrated in Figs. 6. Owing to the positive surface tension, the condensate film becomes 
thinner, above all near θ  = 0 stagnation point. Besides, it is also found that the 
condensate film profile is independent of surface tension effect for different values of e 
because radius of surface curvature remains unchanged. 
Moreover, note that for n = 1.5, the superellipse geometry slightly tends towards a 
straight line. Thus, the influence of the surface tension on the condensate film profiles is 
not appreciably large as shown in Fig. 7. Further, the film thickness depends on e 
28 
smaller e. The effects of e and surface tension on the heat transfer coefficient for n = 3.5 
are similar to those for n = 3. For the case of n = 4, from Fig. 15, it is found that the 
greater the effect of the surface tension, the better the mean heat transfer coefficient. 
 
4. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
This paper describes various kinds of axial symmetry geometry forms by the 
relationship of superellipse geometry parameter n and ellipticity e, superellipses provide 
an interesting form for representing a spectrum of objects whose shape varies among 
rectangles, ellipses, diamonds, and pinched diamonds, etc. It should be noted that the 
numerical results use Nusselt numbers based on an equal condensing area diameter rather 
than a hydraulic diameter. The result obtained only applies to the very slow or quiescent 
vapor condensing outside horizontal superelliptical surface, with negligible interfacial 
vapor shear drag. Taghavi [1988] confirmed the good significance concerning the effect 
of neglected film thickness on the mean heat transfer coefficient. Three major 
conclusions are warranted in the present study. 
(1) Unlike the Nusselt model, considering the gravity drain alone, the present analysis 
considers both the gravity and surface tension forces. The results indicate the surface 
tension has an influence on the local heat transfer rate and hydrodynamics characteristics, 
but the effect of surface tension force on the mean heat transfer coefficient is nearly 
insignificant especially for larger ellipticity. 
(2) For all values of n, the mean heat transfer coefficient is enhanced with increasing 
ellipticity, e. 
(3) The superellipse geometric parameter (n value) exerts a significant effect on the mean 
heat transfer coefficient. The less n is, the higher the mean heat transfer coefficient is.

Film-wise condensation heat transfer of pure vapor flowing onto a body, like a plate, 
tube, and sphere has been widely studied in view of the practical importance in the design 
of condensers for power plants, air-conditioning equipment, and much other chemical 
industrial process equipment. Entropy generation in thermal engineering systems destroys 
system available energy and reduces its efficiency, such as condenser and heat exchanger. 
Thus, entropy generation minimization is of great concern in phase-change heat transfer 
problems associated with film condensation.  
Bejan [1] pioneered the method of entropy generation minimization in heat and mass 
transfer analysis. Meanwhile, in his book [2], he also conducted the second law analysis 
of thermodynamics via the minimization of entropy generation for the single phase 
convection heat transfer. Jani [3] provided optimization of falling film LiBr solution on a 
horizontal single tube based on minimization of entropy generation that irreversibility of 
non-isothermal heat transfer dominants in comparison with the fluid flow friction and 
mass transfer. Sahin [4] investigated the effect of temperature-dependent viscosity on the 
entropy generation rate as well as the ratio of pumping power to heat transfer. 
In a study on the forced-convection cooling of an electronic device consisting of a 
stack of printed circuit boards with heat generation chips, Furukawa [5] employed the 
entropy generation minimization (EGM) method to determine the optimum board spacing 
to maximize heat dissipation. The accuracy and reliability of the EGM method were 
confirmed by satisfactory agreement between its predicted optimal board spacing and that 
obtained by the convectional thermal optimization method. Furukawa and Yang used the 
EGM method to optimize the fin pitch of a plate fin heat sink in free convection [6] and 
the channel flow in a package of parallel boards with discrete block heat sources [7].  
From the above studies, one may see that entropy generation is associated with 
thermodynamic irreversibility which is common in all types of heat transfer processes. 
Film condensation belongs to phase-change heat transfer, but little literature regarding its 
second-law analysis is investigated. The second law analysis of the film condensation 
outside tubes still remains an unsettled question so far. 
Adeyinka and Naterer [8] investigated the physical significance of entropy 
generation in plate film condensation. Their results for the optimizing entropy generation 
and plate size are expressed in terms of a duty parameter. In addition, they observed that

Consider a horizontal elliptical tube with major axis “2a” in the gravitational 
direction and minor axis “2b”, situated in a quiescent pure vapor which is at its saturated 
temperature satT . Moreover, the wall temperature wT  is considered to be nonuniform and 
much lower than the vapor saturation temperature satT . Thus, condensation occurs on the 
wall and a continuous film of the liquid runs downward over the tube under the influence 
of gravity.   
The physical model under consideration is shown in Fig. 1 where the curvilinear 
coordinates ( x , y ) are aligned along the elliptical wall surface and its normal. The 
assumptions employed in the formulation of the problem are: 
(1) The condensate film flow is laminar and steady-state. 
(2) The inertia effect is neglected.  
(3) Viscous dissipation is ignored. 
(4) Compared with the transversal conduction, the axial conduction is negligible. 
(5) The condensate film thickness is much smaller than the curvature diameter.  
According to above assumptions, the condensate film governed equations are written 
as follows.

It is further assumed that at the interface no vapor shear is considered to exert upon 
the condensate. Thus, the boundary conditions are:

Here, the non-isothermality function is adopted from the experiment of Lee et al. [19] for 
circular tube. Note that 10 ≤≤ A  and the amplitude A  depends largely on the ratio of 
the outside-to-inside heat transfer coefficients.  
Using separation of variables, one may derive dimensionless local condensate liquid

wall temperature variation and ellipticities. This may account to the fact that the optimal 
(Ra/Ja) is proportional to Br/Θ, as seen in Eq. (31).  
In Fig. 5, HN , FN  and SN  versus Ra/Ja are drawn for several different values of 
ellipticities respectively. Equation (29) shows that the total entropy generation number is 
induced by the heat transfer irreversibility, HN  and film flow friction irreversibility, FN .  
Apparently, HN  varies as (Ra/Ja) 4
1
 and FN  varies as (Ra/Ja) 4
3−
. It is obvious that 
the contribution to entropy generation rate caused by heat transfer is much more than by 
the film flow friction.  
In general, for the convection heat transfer problem, both fluid friction and finite 
temperature difference heat transfer contribute to the rate of entropy generation. The 
irreversibility distribution ratioϕ  takes care of which irreversibility dominated. The 
entropy generation rate is dominated by film flow friction irreversibility whenϕ >1; while 
the entropy generation rate is dominated by heat transfer irreversibility when ϕ <1. So, 
this may account to the finite temperature difference heat transfer across the condensate 
film thickness in Fig. 6. Note that irreversibility distribution ratio drops as ellipticities 
increases, namely, heat transfer irreversibility plays a more important role for an elliptical 
tube with higher ellipticity. 
Fig.7 presents the variation of irreversibility as a function of the Ra/Ja for amplitude 
of non-isothermal wall temperature variation, A, and ellipticities. The irreversibility 
distribution ratio for the case 0=A  is larger than that for the case 1=A . This may 
account for the more contribution to irreversibility from larger temperature difference 
heat transfer. 
Next, minimum entropy generation rate versus ellipticities in Fig. 8 demonstrates 
that total dimensionless entropy generation numbers increase with Br/Θ and ellipticities. 
It follows from this result that amplitude of non-isothermal wall temperature variation, 
ellipticities and Br/Θ do cause the increase of minimum entropy generation rate. Notably, 
the amplitude of non-isothermal wall temperature variation plays a significant role in the 
growth of minimum entropy generation rate, for instance, 1=A . Therefore, the 
amplitude of non-isothermal wall temperature variation is the major concern for second 
law based on minimization of total entropy generation rate.

Abstract  
This paper aims to perform thermodynamic analysis of saturated vapor flowing 
slowly onto and condensing on an elliptical cylinder. This analysis provides us how the 
geometric parameter-ellipticity affects entropy generation during film-wise condensation 
heat transfer process. The results observe that local condensate film thickness decreases 
with an increase in ellipticity of a cylinder. From the first law point of view, the local heat 
transfer coefficient enhances as ellipticity increases. Meanwhile, from the second law 
point of view, entropy generation increases with increasing the value of ellipticity. We 
derive an expression for entropy generation, which accounts for the combined action of 
the specified irreversibilities. The result demonstrates that thermal irreversibility 
dominates over film flow friction irreversibility. Finally, an expression of minimizing 
entropy generation in laminar film condensation heat transfer is obtained.

Adeyinka and Naterer [8] investigated the physical significance of entropy generation in 
plate film condensation. Lin et al. [9] first performed the second-law analysis on saturated 
vapor flowing through and condensing inside horizontal cooling tubes. They noted that in 
a tube case, an optimum Reynolds number exists at which the entropy generates at a 
minimum rate. Dung and Yang [10] presented the entropy generation minimization 
method to optimize a saturated vapor flowing slowly onto and condensing on an 
isothermal horizontal tube. Their results for the optimizing entropy generation and plate 
size are expressed in terms of a duty parameter. In addition, they observed that entropy 
generation provides a useful parameter in the optimization of a two-phase system. 
Entropy generation is associated with thermodynamic irreversibility which is 
common in all types of heat transfer processes. Film condensation belongs to 
phase-change heat transfer, but little literature regarding its second-law analysis is 
investigated. The second law analysis of the film condensation outside cylinders still 
remains an unsettled question so far. More recently, we first conducted a study [11] on 
the local entropy generation rate of laminar free convection film condensation on an 
elliptical cylinder. That paper investigated how the geometric parameter-ellipticity affects 
local entropy-generation rate during film-wise condensation heat transfer process. 
Currently, the present study will focus on the minimization of total entropy 
generation number to give an idea of optimal design on free convection film condensation 
outside an elliptical cylinder. We derive an expression for the entropy generation number, 
which accounts for the combined action of finite-temperature difference heat transfer 
irreversibility and film flow friction irreversibility. Basically, this study makes good 
engineering sense to focus on the irreversibility of film condensation heat transfer and try 
62 
respectively.

3. Results and Discussion 
     
Fig. 2 indicates the variation of dimensionless entropy generation numbers SN  
with Ra/Ja under the surface tension effects for various ellipticities. Firstly, from the first 
law point of view, we also confirm that the mean heat transfer coefficients enhance with 
value of ellipticity as stated in Yang and Chen [2] study. Secondly, from the second law 
point of view, because dimensionless entropy generation numbers increase with mean 
68 
decreases with Ra/Ja, but increases with Br/Θ.  In general, for the case of 
free-convection film condensation, the entropy-generation rate due to gravity-induced 
film flow friction is usually small. 
Considering the effect of geometrical parameters-ellipticity on the irreversibility 
distribution ratio, we may observe that irreversibility distribution ratio decreases with an 
increase in the ellipticity. This means that the heat transfer irreversibility dominated is 
more significant for the lower ellipticity.   
    Next, minimum entropy generation rate versus ellipticities in Fig. 6 demonstrates 
that total dimensionless entropy generation numbers increase with Br/Θ and ellipticities, 
similar to the mean heat transfer coefficient trend as described in Yang and Hsu [1].   
 
4. Conclusions 
     
This is the first approach using the entropy generation minimization to investigate 
free convection film-wise condensation on an elliptical cylinder. The result obtained only 
applies to the very slow or quiescent vapor condensed outside horizontal elliptical 
cylinders, and to very long elliptical cylinders, with negligible interfacial vapor shear 
drag. The foregoing results can be summarized as follows: 
1. The entropy generation number was found to be a function of the group Rayleigh, 
Brinkman numbers and geometrical parameters-ellipticity. 
2. The effect of group parameters on entropy generation number and the 
irreversibility distribution ratio was examined, respectively.  
3. We can find that heat transfer generation number HN  and dimensionless

1. Introduction 
 
Considering enhancement of condensation heat transfer rate, several researchers, 
such as Yang and Chen (1993a, 1993b) , Ali and McDonald (1977), Karimi (1977), and 
Memory and Rose(1991) have confirmed that cylinders, fins, or extended surfaces of 
elliptical profiles with major axes aligned with gravity are superior to those of circular 
profiles. It is a fact that however heat transfer enhancement is achieved, the increase in 
heat transfer rate is known to augment the friction factor due to pumping power.  With a 
better understanding of how and where the entropy is generated, it is possible to devise 
methods for reducing the overall entropy generation resulting in useful work saving. 
Entropy generation due to convection heat transfer has been investigated by many 
researchers but few have addressed the film condensation. Bejan (1979) first proposed the 
second law analysis of thermodynamics via the minimization of entropy generation for 
the single phase convection heat transfer. In Bejan (1996), concrete methods for 
minimizing entropy generation in engineering equipment for heat transfer were devised. 
He conducted MEG analysis on ducts with constant heat flux for flat plates and cylinders 
in cross flow.  
 Entropy generation is associated with thermodynamic irreversibility which is 
80 
analysis, including first and second law, of laminar film-wise condensation on a 
horizontal elliptical cylinder. 
 
2. Thermal Analysis 
 
Consider a horizontal elliptical cylinder with major axis “2a” in the gravitational 
direction and minor axis “2b”, situated in a quiescent pure vapor which is at its saturated 
temperature satT . Moreover, the wall temperature wT  is considered to be uniform and 
much lower than the vapor saturation temperature satT . Thus, condensation occurs on the 
wall and a continuous film of the liquid runs downward over the tube under the influence 
of gravity.   
Fig.1 illustrates schematically a physical model and coordinate system where the 
curvilinear coordinates (x, y) are aligned along an elliptical cylinder surface and its 
normal. The assumptions employed in the formulation of the problem are:

Note that Brinkman number, Br, is the ratio of viscous energy and heat flux.  
Finally, putting Eq. (15) into Eq. (25) yields as follows: 
86 
Regarding the effect of surface tension forces, according to Yang and Chen (1993a, b) 
and Lee and Yang (2005), the Bond number plays an important role in influencing the 
surface tension forces, as it does in the second law analysis. Fig. 2 also indicates that the 
entropy generation number is nearly unaffected by surface tension forces at a small 
ellipticity like e 7.0≤ , but somewhat influenced at large ellipticity for whole perimeters. 
Namely, the effect of surface tension on the entropy generation number is significant at a 
larger ellipticity. Owing to the decreasing surface curvature, the surface tension force 
pulls the condensate film thinner. However, on the lower half of the tube, the increasing 
surface curvature makes the film thicker than the film without considering effect of 
surface tension. 
Next, as for the effect of Brinkman group parameter on the entropy generation rate, 
with a specified value of ellipticity, Fig. 3 indicates obviously that entropy generation 
number increases with an increase in the parameter Θ/Br . This confirms that the 
parameter Θ/Br  plays an important role in influencing irreversibility induced by 
condensate flow friction. The entropy generation number increases with increasing 
ellipticity as the local heat transfer coefficient does. In other words, the local entropy 
generation rate is significantly affected by the local condensation heat transfer rate. 
Moreover, one may achieve the minimization of entropy-generation rate by reducing the 
value of Θ/Br . 
 
88 
Figure 4 demonstrates that the entropy generation number due to heat transfer 
irreversibility falls down to nil along the streamwise length as the dimensionless local 
heat transfer coefficient does. Furthermore, entropy-generation rate due to film flow 
friction varies as φ3/4sin . Notably, φsin  is the effective component of gravity-driven 
film velocity along the gravitational direction. Besides, entropy-generation rate due to 
film flow friction increases with Br/Θ. The film flow friction irreversibility is becoming 
significant, as compared to diminishing heat transfer irreversibility after 5.0=s . Since 
FN  varies as φ3/4sin , the film flow friction irreversibility can match its contribution 
against heat transfer irreversibility in the local entropy generation rate on the lower half 
of a cylinder.  
 
Fig. 4 Local entropy-generation rate due to heat transfer vs. film flow friction 
irreversibility for various ellipticities 
 
90 
this second point that the irreversibility due to flow friction can be reduced by decreasing 
the values of Θ/Br or ellipticity.

4. Concluding Remarks 
 
This is the first approach using the thermodynamic second law to investigate free 
convection film-wise condensation on an elliptical cylinder. The result obtained only 
applies to very slow or quiescent vapor condensed outside horizontal elliptical cylinders, 
with negligible interfacial vapor shear drag.   
The foregoing results can be summarized as follows: 
(1) The local heat transfer coefficients and the entropy generation number have a direct 
relationship. 
(2) The entropy generation number can be reduced by decreasing Θ/Br .

chemical industrial process equipment since pioneer researcher Nusselt [1]. The 
investigations of free convection film condensation heat transfer were conducted by 
Rohsenow [2] for a vertical plate; Yang [3] and Dhir and Lienhard [4], and Yang and 
Chen [5] for a sphere; Chen [6], Sparrow and Gregg [7] for a cylinder; Yang and Chen [8] 
for an elliptical cylinder, respectively. All the above literatures focus on the 
thermodynamics first law approach to condensation heat transfer analysis. 
Conservation of useful energy depends on the design of efficient thermodynamic 
heat-transfer processes, i.e. minimization of entropy generation due to heat transfer and 
viscous dissipation. Entropy generation in thermal engineering systems destroys system 
available energy and reduces its efficiency. Film condensation on a horizontal cylinder 
has many thermal engineering applications, for example, in heat exchangers and heat 
pipes. With better understanding of how and where entropy is generated, it is possible to 
devise methods for reducing the overall entropy generation resulting in useful work 
saving. Entropy generation due to convection heat transfer has been investigated by many 
researchers but few addressed the film condensation. Bejan [9] first proposed the second 
law analysis of thermodynamics via the minimization of entropy generation for the single 
phase convection heat transfer. In that book, Bejan devised concrete methods for 
minimizing entropy generation in engineering equipment for heat transfer. He conducted 
MEG analysis on ducts with constant heat flux for flat plates and cylinders in cross flow. 
Later Nag and Mukherjee [10], Sahin [11] both studied the isothermal second law 
analysis of viscous fluid in a circular duct. More recently, Saouli and Aiboud-Saouli [12] 
conducted second law analysis of laminar liquid falling film along an inclined heated 
plate and found that fluid friction irreversibility dominates over heat transfer 
112 
Consider a pure saturated vapor at T sat  flowing very slowly onto a horizontal tube 
at a uniform temperature, T w . Since the tube wall temperature is lower than saturated 
vapor temperature T sat , condensation occurs on the wall and then a continuous film of 
liquid condensate flows downward over the cylinder/sphere under the simultaneous 
effects of both gravity and shear force. Further, the liquid-vapor interface is assumed to 
be smooth and free interfacial shear drag.  
The physical model and coordinate system under consideration is shown in Fig. 1 
where the curvilinear coordinates (x, y) are aligned along the tube wall surface and its 
normal. With the assumptions of Rohsenow’s work [2], this leads to the governing 
equations for the mass, momentum and energy balance in the film:

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
    Firstly, Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate that the entropy generation number due to heat 
transfer irreversibility falls down to nil along the streamwise length as the dimensionless 
local heat transfer coefficient does. This trend is attributed by the diminished heat transfer 
coefficient due to increasing film thickness. It is also seen in Eq. (25) that HN  varies as 
the square of Nusselt number. This may account for the higher contribution to 
irreversibility induced by the same finite temperature difference heat transfer occurring 
for a cylinder 
for a sphere 
118 
condensate flow friction. Thus, one may achieve the minimization of entropy generation 
by reducing the value of Br/Ψ.  Furthermore, entropy-generation number increases with 
Ra/Ja as dimensionless local heat transfer coefficient does.

Finally, Fig. 6 indicates that the irreversibility distribution ratio for a cylinder is less than 
unity, increasing with the circumferential streamline length around the lower half of 
cylindrical perimeter ( )7.0 πθ = . But, for the higher values of Ψ/Br , e. g. 75.0/ ≥ψBr , 
the irreversibility distribution ratio rises up to the value greater than unity in the lower 
half of a cylinder. This means that heat transfer irreversibility dominates over fluid 
friction irreversibility for the whole cylindrical perimeter except for the higher values 
120 
ratio is smaller than unity in the beginning and then rises up to the value greater than 
unity in the lower half of a sphere.

4. CONCLUSION 
This is the first approach using thermodynamic second law to investigate free 
convection film condensation from saturated vapor flowing slowly onto an isothermal 
horizontal cylinder/sphere. Basically, the local entropy generation rate induced by heat 
transfer irreversibility is directly proportion to Nusselt number but inversely proportion to 
film thickness. On the other hand, the local entropy generation rate induced by 
gravity-driven film flow friction irreversibility is proportion to Brinkman number. In 
order to achieve minimization of entropy-generation rate, one should reduce the values of 
Brinkman group parameters without losing condensation heat transfer coefficient. 
Notably, as group Rayleigh parameters increase, dimensionless heat transfer coefficient is 
enhanced, but entropy generation number is augmented too.
