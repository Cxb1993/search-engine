ABSTRACT: To efficiently operate wireless ad hoc networks, subsets of network topology,
called virtual backbones, will be constructed and maintained. A spanner is a subset of the network
topology in which the minimal total cost, e.g. distance or energy consumption, to transmit packets
between any pair of nodes is only a constant fact larger than in the original network topology.
Hence spanners are good candidates of virtual backbones. Geometric structures, including
Euclidean minimal spanning trees (EMST), relative neighbor graphs (RNG), Gabriel graphs (GG),
Delauney triangulations (DT), Yao's graphs (YG), etc., are widely used ingredients to construct
spanners. The related topics about how to construct and maintain virtual backbones are called
topology control. A topology control algorithm is localized if each node only needs to collect
information from few hops neighbors.
In many applications, ad hoc devices are powered by batteries. Usually, it is impractical or
even not possible to exchange or charge the batteries. To elongate the lifetime of wireless devices
and systems, energy efficiency is one of the most important issues. A major approach is to
communicate with partners using the smallest transmission power. In this work, we gave the
minimal transmission radius that allows us to construct the geometric structures by localized and
distributed algorithms using only 1-hop neighbor information. The minimal transmission radius is
called a critical transmission radius. In the report, we are going to brief our results on connectivity,
coverage, and the longest Gabriel edge.
Keywords: Wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, topology control, isolated nodes, coverage,
Gabriel graphs.
2II. OBJECTIVES
A. The Number of Isolated Nodes
For a randomly-deployed wireless ad hoc network, the uncertainty of network connectivity is
the first problem we need to face. A network can't function well if the induced network topology is
not connected. The critical transmission radius for connectivity is the smallest transmission radius
r such that the induced r -disk graph is connected. It was known that if an r-disk graph over a
random point set is with no isolated node, it is connected with high probability. Thus, to investigate
the connectivity of wireless ad hoc networks, we are interested in the number of isolated nodes. In a
realistic system, nodes may become inactive, and links may become down. These inactive nodes
and down links cannot take part in routing/relaying and thus may affect the connectivity. However,
this aspect was not discussed in the most related research works. In our works, we gave the
asymptotic probability distribution of the number of isolated nodes in networks with unreliable
nodes and/or links.
B. Coverage by Randomly Deployed Wireless Sensor Networks
One of the main applications of wireless sensor networks is to provide proper coverage of their
deployment regions. A wireless sensor network k -covers its deployment region if every point in its
deployment region is within the coverage ranges of at least k sensors. In a randomly-deployed
wireless sensor networks, the coverage is a random variable. Assume that the sensors are deployed
as either a Poisson point process or a uniform point process in a square or disk region. We studied
how the probability of the k -coverage changes with the sensing radius or the number of sensors.
C. The Longest Edge of Gabriel Graphs
In wireless ad hoc networks, without fixed infrastructures, virtual backbones are constructed and
maintained to efficiently operate such networks. The Gabriel graph (GG) is one of widely used
geometric structures for topology control in wireless ad hoc networks. In the GG, two nodes have an
edge between them if and only if there is no other node on the disk using the segment of these two
nodes as its diameter. Assume all nodes are with the same maximal transmission radius r . To
construct the GG only by 1-hop neighbor information, the transmission radius r should be large
enough such that the GG is a subgraph of the r -disk graph. Thus, the transmission radius should be
not less than the length of the longest edge of the GG. On the other hand, for each node, if it can
gather the information of nodes that are not farther than its farthest neighbor in the GG, it can decide
all GG edges incident to it. Therefore, the length of the longest edge of the GG is the minimal
transmission radius such that the GG can be constructed by using only 1-hop neighbor information
and is called the critical transmission radius for the GG.
III. RELATED WORKS
The theory of random graphs was initiated by Erdős and Rényi (1969) [4], in which each pair of
vertices is joined by an edge independently and uniformly at some probability. Since then hundreds
4IV. MAIN RESULTS
Let ,, 21 XX be independent and uniformly distributed random points on a bounded region A
in the plane. Given a positive integer n , the point process  nXXX ,,, 21  is referred to as the
uniform n -point process on A , and is denoted by AnX . Given a positive number , let
Po be a Poisson random variable with parameter , independent of  ,, 21 XX . Then the
point process  Po21 ,,, XXX  is referred to as the Poisson point process with mean  on A ,
and is denoted by AP .
A. The Number of Isolated Nodes
Let  be a unit-area square or disk. Assume that the wireless ad hoc network consists of n
which is modeled by nX .
First, we consider wireless ad hoc networks in which nodes are not all active. The inactive or
unavailable nodes may be caused by, for example, internal breakdown or being in the sleeping state.
In such networks, a node is said isolated if it is not adjacent to active nodes. Assume nodes are
active (or available) independently with probability p for some constant 10 p . We have the
following theorem. [18]
Theorem 1. Suppose that all nodes have a maximum transmission radius

rn 
 ln for
some constant . Then the total number of isolated nodes is asymptotically Poisson with
mean e , and the total number of isolated active nodes is also asymptotically Poisson with
mean pe .
Next, we consider wireless ad hoc networks with unreliable nodes and links. Assume nodes are
active independently with probability 10 1 p , and links are up independently with probability
10 2 p . A node is said to be isolated if it doesn't have an up link to an active node. We have the
following theorem. [21]

transmission radius

nodes is asymptotically Poisson with mean e , and the total number of isolated active nodes
is also asymptotically Poisson with mean ep1 .
The work can be extended for secure wireless networks which apply m -composite key
predistribution schemes. In the m -composite key predistribution scheme, the key pool contains K

C. The Longest Edge of Gabriel Graphs
Let nP denote a Poisson point process with density n over a unit-area disk. Assume that the
wireless ad hoc network consists of n nodes modeled by nP , and all nodes have the same
maximal transmission radius nr . We use nG P to denote the Gabriel graph over nP . For
simplicity, the edges of GGs are call Gabriel edges. If G is a geometric graph, we use G to
denote the maximal length of an edge of G and  lGN , to denote the number of edges of G
whose length is at least l . Our first result about the GG is the next theorem. [20]
