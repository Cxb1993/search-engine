Abstract 
The objective of this project is to conquer 
two major drawbacks shared by many existing 
backstepping-based control schemes, first, the 
kinematic controller contains a high-order 
polynomial function of the desired velocity 
which may result in extremely high control 
torques in fast motion applications; second, 
the dynamic controllers are restricted for cases 
with the input matrix being exactly known a 
priori. For conquering the first drawback, a 
modified saturation function, replacing the 
high-order polynomial, is included to keep the 
control from growing unbounded while 
preserve the asymptotic tracking stability 
simultaneously. Next, based on our earlier 
smooth switching control designs, a hybrid 
control scheme for conquering the second 
restriction is constructed. Not only the 
theoretical analysis ensuring the validity of the 
proposed design is conducted but also 
simulation results demonstrating the 
usefulness are also provided 
    
     
Keywords: Hybrid-based controller, 
switching mechanism, modified saturation 
function.

where pR denotes the lumped parameter 
vector while pnRH  is the regression 
matrix depending on vqq ,,  and v . 
P2): The selection of the matrix ),( qqC  is not 
unique, and in particular, it can always be 
selected to render the matrix CM 2 skew 
symmetric. 
Under the condition that the parameter vector 
  being unknown, the control objective is to 
determine a control law for  such that 
),(),( dd qqqq    as t . 
The first step is to obtain the dynamics on the 
reduced constraint manifold fulfilling (1), 
which is )1( m dimensional and free from 
constraint forces. The assumption of )(qJ
being of full rank implies the existence of a 
smooth distribution, denoted J , which totally 
annihilates the row vectors of )(qJ  for all
nRq . More formally, there exists a set of 
linearly independent vector field 1)(  mRqv
such that

  Taking time derivatives of (5) results in 
vRvRq                 (5) 
By substituting (5) and (6) into (2) and then 
multiplying both sides by SRT , it yields

Equations (4) and (6) constitute a set of
)1( mn algebraic-differential equations 
describing the dynamics on the constraint 
manifold. It is quite common to first convert 
(4) into certain canonical forms to facilitate 
the control designs [8]. In the sequel, we 
assume there exists a diffeomorphic 
coordinate transformation ),(qy  vqu )(   
with )1()1()(  mmRq , under which the 
kinematic subsystem (4) can be transformed 
into  the  m-chain single-generator chained 
canonical form

We can now state that

algorithm in (18). Sustained A1), the 
following goals can be achieved

  To demonstrate the validity of the proposed 
design, two case studies of a unicycle-like 
wheeled mobile robot and a fire truck system 
are conducted in this section. 
The constrained dynamics of the unicycle-like 
wheeled mobile robot in Fig. 1 can be

 where 21 ,qq are the coordinates of the 
reference point P in the inertial frame, 3q is the 
orientation of the reference frame with respect 
to the inertial frame, m is the mass of the robot, 
and 0I  is its inertia moment about the vertical 
axis at point P ,W is the radius of the wheels 
and L2 is the length of the axis of the front 
wheels, and 21 , are the motor torques. The 
matrix )(qR that spans the J subspace is 
identified as

for the uncertain nonholonomic mobile robot 
system consisting of the kinematics (1), the 
dynamics (2), the control algorithm (17), and 
the parameter update algorithm (21). By 
adopting an exponentially modulated linear 
control function instead of the conventional 
polynomial ones, it preserves the global 
asymptotic tracking stability without resorting 
to high control forces at the same time.
