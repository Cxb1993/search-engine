Abstract 
Opportunistic multicast schemes for time-sensitive stream traffic are studied for cellular networks. The 
forward-link with each user is modeled as a discrete-time fading channel over which all erasure-encoded 
packets transmitted in a slot are either totally received or lost depending on SNR levels. Assume that to 
successfully decode a transmitted stream fragment, it suffices for a user to receive k packets in a session of 
erasure-coded transmission of the fragment. If the distribution of IID channel states is available, the scheme 
is simply to compute and use the optimal constant transmission rate and minimum fixed transmission stopping 
time subject to a reliability constraint. We show that the minimum stopping time grows with the logarithm of 
multicast group size. If channel state information is available, scheduling schemes are proposed to minimize 
random stopping time through selecting each optimal instantaneous transmission rate for a utility function. 
To take advantage of system transient states and dynamics raised by the requirement of small k for short 
transmission delay, the designed utility function specifically involves users with incomplete services, the 
residual work of each incomplete user, and their variance. Results show that the scheme with an exponential 
weighted function of residual work achieves the least mean stopping time.

typically considers the case of large k suitable for high-rate encoding and delay-tolerant data traffic and 
thereby scheduling approaches are proposed to be efficient in the long-term steady state [11][13]. 
 
Under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) SNR levels among group users 
and over time, our approaches are as follows: 
1. Suppose that there is no channel state information (CSI) feedback but prior knowledge of the 
distribution of SNR levels available. The method of multicasting is simply to compute and choose 
the optimal constant transmission rate and minimum fixed stopping time that guarantees the delivery 
of k packets to all users in a probabilistic sense. We prove that the asymptotic behavior of the 
minimum stopping time for a chosen transmission rate is O(ln(m)) for large group size m. 
2. Suppose that there is CSI feedback. With the history of scheduled users for reception, the stopping 
time can be precisely determined at the time when the delivery of k packets to all users has been 
guaranteed. It is basically a random variable on account of stochastic channel processes. To 
minimize the stopping time, the key issue is transmission rate scheduling for each time slot.  By 
posing this issue as one for maximizing a utility function slot by slot, we focus on the design of 
utility function instead. 
 
For the development of utility functions, users who have not successfully received k packets are 
designated as incomplete ones, incomplete users who have residual work larger than the largest residual work 
minus a given threshold are designated as critical ones, and the service weight of an incomplete user is 
defined to be proportional to the exponential function of residual work multiplied by a common constant. The 
utility function is simply defined as the product of a chosen transmission rate and a factor. By the order of 
increasing complexity the factor is designed to represent the number of users able to receive the rate, the 
number of incomplete users able to receive the rate, the number of critical users able to receive the rate, and 
the sum of service weight of each incomplete user able to receive the rate, respectively. We then study the 
expected stopping time with respect to each factor employed and show that it decreases with the complexity 
of the factor involved. 
 
Specifically, each multicast group user has an individual stopping time at the instant when the user 
receives no less than k packets. Our approach is to minimize maximum individual stopping time by selecting 
each instantaneous transmission rate, which can be stated as a min-max problem. In contrast, it was dealt with 
in [13] as a max-min problem, to maximize minimum individual steady-state throughput in a fixed frame time. 
For latency constraint, they argued that by limiting a frame of transmission to n slots and coding over a 
smaller number of blocks, decoding-delay can be upper-bound by      while the penalty of losses in 
capacity gain is lower bounded by  
 
√ 
 . 
 
Among other related works, authors in [8][9] introduced a static, a hybrid ARQ-based, and a cooperative 
multicast strategy and analyzed asymptotic behaviors on delay and throughput. The scheduler in [7] 
incorporates the Proportional Fair (PF) algorithm [2] and the exponential rule [3][22] to support different 
levels of QoS requirement, but transmits multicast messages at a peak data rate that all group members can 
 6 
 
With erasure encoded transmission, those lost blocks can be recovered through time and code diversity. 
To successfully decode a stream fragment, the assumption here is simply that it suffices to receive k packets in 
a session of erasure coded transmission of the fragment. Users having received k or more packets in a session 
thus obtain complete services of a fragment. Certainly this requires that each new received packet is not a 
linear combination of those having been received by the user before transmission stop if the original stream 
fragment has k blocks and a linear code is employed. With CSI and the history of scheduled users for 
reception, it is possible to design a high rate code. Otherwise we can encode a shorter stream fragment, 
smaller than k blocks. 
 
Let Ni(t) denote the total number of packets that has been received by user i at the end of time t and  
Ni(0)=0  iG. Suppose that j packets are sent by the BS in time slot t>0.  Then  Ni(t)= Ni(t1)+jI{Xi(t)  j} 
where I is the indicator function. By excluding from G those users having received k or more packets, the set 
of incomplete users in time slot t is denoted by G(t)=G{i; Ni(t1) k}, t>0. 
 
 If k is very large and CSI {Xi(t), iG} is available, one efficient approach is to maximize multicast 
throughput      ∑      (t)/t by choosing an optimal transmission rate  ̃             ∑              and 
sending  ̃ packets in time slot t. Then     
    
→  [ ̃ ∑         ̃    ] as t by the strong law of large numbers. 
If there is no CSI feedback but prior knowledge of the distribution {pj} available, one solution is to choose a 
constant  ̃              [∑          ] and send   ̃ packets in each time slot. This results in multicast 
throughput     
    
→   ̃ [∑      ̃ ̃    ]     ̃        ̃   as t by the strong law of large numbers. 
However, k can't be practically large for time-sensitive stream traffic because of a requirement for very 
limited store-and-forward delay. 
 
A.  Stopping time and multicast reliability in the case of small k 
The BS transmits packets with encoded blocks from the current stream fragment at time slots 1,2,,Ts 
and then continues to transmit those from the next stream fragment after time slot Ts. This moment Ts 
represents a stopping time for transmission of a multicast stream fragment. Let   ̃ be the time when the 
number of users having received k or more packets first reaches  ̃, i.e.,   ̃     {  ∑             ̃   }  
      |    |     ̃    for    . Also let    ̃
 
. If stopping time Ts is chosen to satisfy      ̃  
      for a given , we call the transmission strategy a reliable -multicast; Otherwise it is unreliable. For 
=1, a reliable -multicast guarantees that each user receives at least k packets from a stream fragment. 
 
If there is no CSI feedback but only peak feasible rate distribution {pj} available, the BS has no choice 
but to choose a fixed transmission rate jc> 0 pkts/slots and set a constant stopping time Ts=ts. The choice of a 
small ts for performance generally leads to an unreliable -multicast if      ̃        holds.  Thus, a 
sensible approach to determining the values of jc and ts is to schedule an optimal rate jc Rs that minimizes ts 
subject to the constraint      ̃        for some given .  It is mathematically tractable to compute ts and 
jc. Specifically, let the probability that a user, say i, successfully receives j transmitted packets in a time slot 
 8 
Note that for Pr{Xi(t)  j
*
}>0 and Pr{j
*
=0}<1, with probability 1 the event {Ni(t)<k} for any finite k will 
occur only a finite number of time by the strong law for the renewal reward process [25]. Thus conditioning 
|G|<,  Pr{Ts<}=1. 
 
B.  Maximize effective Broadcast Volume (MeBV) 
Taking into account changes in group size |G(t)| and residual work Li(t) for each user iG, the method 
follows MBV except that the minimum transmission rate that maximizes the product of the chosen rate and 
the number of incomplete users able to receive the transmission is selected. That is, the number of packets to 
be sent in time slot t is 
      {           ∑                 [       ]},      (4) 
where ab = min{a,b}. 
 
Scheme MeBV is designed to explore, apart from the impact of residual work Li(t), that  optimal rate j
*
 
adapted to incomplete user group G(t) gives stochastically larger effective multicast throughput at time t, as 
compared to MBV.  This will be validated by Lemma 1-(ii) in Section IV. 
 
C.  Modified MeBV (MMeBV) 
Those incomplete users with residual work larger than the largest residual work minus a given threshold 
d
*
 are defined as critical ones. The idea behind MMeBV is that the group of critical users should be given 
preference for receiving more multicast throughput than the others since stopping time Ts is most likely 
determined by users with larger residual work. MMeBV follows MeBV except that whenever the set of 
critical users is nonempty, the minimum transmission rate that maximizes the product of the chosen rate and 
the number of critical users able to receive the transmission is selected.  
Specifically, if Lmax(t)Lmin(t)d
*
, the transmission rate at time t is 
      {           ∑                 [       ]}       (5) 
else it is   
      {           ∑              ̃   [       ]}       (6) 
where  ̃   = {i; iG(t), Li(t)>Lmax(t)d
*
} is the set of critical users. 
 
Note that the preference for serving critical users does not preclude any other user from receiving the 
transmission as long as they have adequate SNR levels. 
 
D.  MeBV combined with linear-and-log residual work product ( LNxLOG) 
Although MMeBV selects a transmission rate for the set of critical users to achieve a larger multicast 
throughput stochastically, those critical users with the largest residual work may still fail to receive 
transmission at a scheduled rate due to insufficient SNR values. Instead of partitioning the group of 
incomplete users into critical and non-critical subsets for two different service preference, the method of 
LNxLOG gives each user i a specific service weight proportional to the product Li(t)log(1+Li(t)). 
Consequently, the chosen transmission rate is more likely determined for those users with the largest residual 
work to successfully receive transmission. This is a way to keep the dispersion of {Li(t),iG} with time in 
check, in order to raise the effective broadcast gain at each time slot and hence reduce mean stopping time Ts.   
 10 
 
Proposition 1: For =1, reliability constraint 0<<1, and constant transmission rate j>0 with the 
probability 0<j <1 of success in receiving the transmission rate, 
ts(ln m)           (11) 
 
Proof: The detail can be found in [27].                
Proposition 1 implies that stopping time ts associated with a chosen constant transmission rate for group 
size m is not very sensitive to some extent of changes in m. Since all adaptive scheduling schemes in section 
III exploit CSI to achieve shorter stopping time, we claim that E[Ts] by each of them doesn't grow faster than  
(ln m).

Proof: The detail can be found in [27].                
 
In the following we will suppose that j has replaced each jLi(t) in (4), (5) and (6), ignoring any potential 
impact by the last tiny residual work.  Let Tb and Te denote the stopping time for serving k packets to 
multicast group G by MBV and MeBV, respectively. That is, Tb=min{t; G(t)=0 by MBV}1 and Te=min{t; 
G(t)=0 by MeBV}1.  Recall that cutoff time tf. 
  
 Proposition 2: For MBV and MeBV separately operating under the same iid channel states {Xi(t), t>0} 
iG,  E[Tb] E[Te]. 
Proof: The detail can be found in [27].                
 
Note from (3) and (4) that under the same channel state processes {Xi(t)}, both MBV and MeBV will 
follow the same transmission rate schedule until the first time when G(t) G. Let this time slot be denoted by 
t1 = min{t; G(t)  G}. Now consider an auxiliary scheduling approach that initially follows MBV to select a 
 12 
 
Although intuitively such an event tn+1tn >> tntn-1 in Proposition 3 may not often happen when k is 
small, the condition tn+1tn >> tntn-1 is too stringent. Besides, it is noncausal because a scheduler at time tn-1 
cannot have future channel information {Xi(t) i ; t>tn-1} in advance. However, residual work Li(t) can be 
used as a cheap estimate of virtual future time from t until stop. Thereby scheme MMeBV in Subsection III-C 
has exploited such correspondences tn-10, tnLmax(t)Lmin(t)d
*
 and tn+1 Lmax(t)Lmin(t) and then taken a 
rough match in that the condition Lmax(t)Lmin(t)>d
*
 (i.e. tntn-1=tn>0) for a given threshold d
*
 is used in place 
of the condition tn+1tn>>tntn-1. If Lmax(t)Lmin(t)>d
*
 is true, MMeBV determines transmission rate jd(t) only 
from the group of critical users, {i; Li(t)>Lmax(t)d
*
, iG(t)}. Proposition 3-(ii) implies that this chosen rate 
allows those critical users to receive more packets. Schemes LNxLOG and Exp-weight have also involved 
the condition. 
 
 
V. Numerical results and discussions 
 
By the Shannon-Hartley theorem the capacity of a communication channel of bandwidth B Hz subject to 
AWGN is B log2(1+SNR). Let (sec) be the length of a time slot. We consider that the size of a packet is B 
bits and that the maximum peak transmission rate is 10 pkts/slot. Thus Rs= {0,1,2,,10}. Recall the definition 
pj=Pr{X=j} denoting the probability density of peak feasible rate X=j pkts for a user in a time slot. Ignoring all 
possible required margin of SNR value for decoding, we have 
   {
  {               }          
                                                          
 
For Rayleigh fading channel with mean received signal power 2 and mean received AWGN power 1, the 
distribution {pj} is then 
   {
 
  
   
    
  
     
                       
 
  
    
                                               
 
This distribution {pj} is used in subsection V-A for numerical analysis of minimum fixed transmission 
stopping time when no CSI feedback is available and in subsection V-B for simulations of different proposed 
transmission rate scheduling algorithms. 
 
A. Optimal stopping time for no CSI feedback 
As described in subsection II-A, without CSI feedback the scheduling strategy for 1-multicast is to use 
constant transmission rate jc pkts/slot and stopping time ts where jcarg minjRs ts subject to the constraint 
Pr{m>ts}<. Given state distribution {pj}, the optimal rate jc and minimum stopping time ts for each 3-tuple 
of (, k, m) can be found from (1) and exhaustive search. Numerical results for minimum ts are plotted in 
Figure 1 for constraints =0.01 (denoted by 1pct) and =0.1 (denoted by 10pct), respectively. Each stream 
fragment has a length of k=53 packets. It can be seen that as group size m=2
i
, i=0,1,, 19, increases, 
minimum stopping time ts tends to grow with ln(m). This substantiates ts(ln m) in Proposition 1.

VI. Concluding remarks 
We have investigated transmission rate scheduling schemes, aimed to minimizing transmission stopping 
time for delivering each fragment of a real time stream over fading channels to a multicast group in one-hop 
wireless networks. Those schemes have been designed to utilize channel state information and the history of 
packet reception by each multicast user, in order to take advantage of system transient state behaviors due to a 
finite small stream fragment size. We found that the most efficient one, Exp-weight, achieves the least mean 
stopping time through selecting a transmission rate at each time slot that maximizes an up-to-date utility 
function. Here the utility function has been formulated to take into account only those multicast users with 
incomplete services, the exponential weight of residual work in the number of packets required to complete 
services for an incomplete user, and a force factor to limit the dispersion of residual work among incomplete 
users. Besides, if multiple rates can be chosen to achieve the maximum utility, the least one is selected. 
Assuming IID symmetrical Rayleigh fading channel, we found for a stream fragment size of 53 packets that if 
mean channel SNR is not too low, the mean stopping time can be reduced by 7% around compared to MBV, 
the greediest scheme for broadcast gain, and that the percentage of reduction becomes lower for larger stream 
fragment size. On the other hand, results for low mean SNR have implied that it is important to use a smaller 
packet size instead in order to avoid the cutoff rate at one large packet per slot.
