英文摘要 
  The attempt to interconnect hundreds or more processing elements in computers is of use to 
solve numerous real-world problems, so that the interconnection network is mostly a critical 
factor affecting the system performance. In particular, network embedding is of great 
importance because the portability between the guest and host networks would permit executing 
the guest specified algorithms on the host with as little modification as possible. Since linear 
arrays and rings are two of the most fundamental structures for parallel and distributed 
computation, this project is aimed to explore the efficient methods of cycle and path embedding 
(Aim 1), and to address two topological properties and their variations related to path 
embedding in interconnection networks: one is panconnectedness (Aim 2) and the other is 
Hamiltonicity (Aim 3).  
Aim 1: Efficient Cycle and Path Embedding in Interconnection networks 
  The problem of embedding cycles or paths of the given length into interconnection networks 
corresponds to the concept of pancyclicity or panconnectedness, respectively. A network G is 
called pancyclic if it contains a cycle of length l for each integer l from 3 to |V(G)| inclusive, 
where V(G) denotes the vertex set of G. A network G is said to be panconnected if, for any two 
distinct vertices x and y, it has an [x,y]-path of length l for each dG(x,y) ≤ l ≤ |V(G)| −1, where 
dG(x,y) denotes the distance between x and y in G. In practice, because the network components 
may have no function accidentally, it is greatly demanded to take the fault-tolerance related 
issues into account. In this proposal the fault-tolerant panconnectedness will be addressed.  
Aim 2: On the Variations of Panconnectedness 
  As our extension of the original panconnectedness property, two possible variations are 
considered in this study. One is called panpositionable panconnectedness (Aim 2.1), and the 
other is called two-disjoint-path panconnectedness (Aim 2.2). Then many other topological 
properties of interconnection networks follow immediately. 
Aim 3: On the Variation of Hamiltonicity 
  The problem of finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is well known to be NP-complete, and 
thus has been widely discussed. In this proposal we address the concept of mutually independent 
Hamiltonian cycles, which is related to the number of Hamiltonian cycles in a given graph. In 
particular, this concept will be concerned with respect to some classes of interconnection 
networks.

1981), and in combinatorial designs (Diaconis and Holmes 1994). With respect to those Cayley 
graphs for which the existence of Hamiltonian cycles has already been proven, further properties 
related to this problem, such as edge-Hamiltonicity, Hamiltonian connectedness, and Hamiltonian 
laceability, etc., are investigated (Alspach and Qin 2001, Chen and Quimpo 1983). In this study 
we address one of such properties, the concept of mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles (Sun 
et al. 2006, Teng et al. 2006), which is concerned with the number of Hamiltonian cycles in a 
graph. Since its introduction, it also gains many researchers' attention (Hsieh and Yu 2007, Kueng 
et al. 2008, Kueng et al. 2009b, Lin et al. 2009a, Lin et al. 2009b, Shih et al. 2009). 
二、 研究方法、研究成果 
Our research contribution includes the following five parts: 
I. Fault-tolerant Path Embedding on the Hypercube 
Conventional distributed systems typically consist of a fixed set of computers. During practical 
operation, occasionally a small subset of computers might fail (crash or behave maliciously). 
Thanks to ingenious communication protocols, these failures can be detected so that operable parts 
of the system will eventually be guided back to a save state. For these reason, the fault tolerance 
computing has long been an important issue in the area of network computing. 
Among the many kinds of network topologies, the hypercube is one of the most popular 
networks for parallel and distributed computing. Not only is it ideally suited to both 
special-purpose and general-purpose tasks, but it can efficiently simulate many other networks 
(Leighton 1992). Let u=bn-1…bi…b0 be an n-bit binary string. For any j, 0 ≤ j ≤ n-1, we use (u)
j
 to 
denote the binary string bn-1… j…b0. Moreover, we use (u)j to denote the bit bj of u. The 
Hamming weight of u, denoted by wH(u), is |{0 ≤ i ≤ n-1| (u)i = 1}|. The n-cube Qn consists of 2
n
 
nodes and n2
n-1
 links. Each node corresponds to an n-bit binary string. Two nodes, u and v, are 
adjacent if and only if v = (u)
j
 for some j and we call the link (u,(u)
j
) j-dimensional. We define 
dim((u,v)) = j if v = (u)
j
. The Hamming distance between u and v, denoted by h(u,v), is defined to 
be |{0 ≤ i ≤ n-1| (u)i  (v)i}|. Hence two nodes, u and v, are adjacent if and only if h(u,v) = 1. It is 
well known that Qn is a bipartite graph with two disjoint partite sets V0(Qn)={u∈V(Qn) | wH(u) is 
even} and V1(Qn)={u∈V(Qn) | wH(u) is odd}. Moreover, Qn is both node-transitive and 
link-transitive (Leighton 1992). 
Lemma I.1 (Saad and Shultz 1988): For any two nodes, u and v, of Qn, there exist n internally 
node-disjoint paths joining u and v, h(u, v) of which are of length h(u, v) and the other n - h(u, v) 
of which are of length h(u, v) + 2. 
The issue of faulty hypercubes has been widely addressed in researches (Chan and Lee 1991, Fu 
2006, Latifi et al. 1992, Li et al. 2003, Tsai et al. 2002, Tsai 2004, Xu et al. 2006). In particular, 
7 
 
Corollary I.4 (Kung et al. 2009): Let F be a set of hybrid node-faults and/or link-faults in Qn, n≥
3, such that every node of Qn has at least one reachable neighbor. Then D(Q4 - F)=4 if |F|≤2; 
D(Q4-F)=5 if |F|=3; D(Q4-F)=6 if |F|∈{4,5}, where D( . ) is the diameter of a graph G. When 
n4, 
         
                                          
                       
                                   
  
 
  The following figure shows an example in which the distance between node 0100 and node 
0111 is just 6. 
 
FIGURE 1: An example that distance between 0100 and 0111 is 6. 
 
Our main results of fault-tolerant path embedding on hypercube network are included in the 
next theorem. 
Theorem I.5 (Kueng et al. 2009c): Let F be a set of 2n-5 faulty links in Qn (n≥3) such that every 
node of Qn - F has at least two neighbors. Suppose that u and v are two arbitrary nodes of Qn - F 
with distance d*=dQn-F(u,v)≥2. Then Qn - F contains a path of length l between u and v for every 
integer l satisfying both d* ≤ l   2n - 1 and 2 | (l - d*). 
 
II. The Double-Pancyclicity of Augmented Cubes 
A graph G is known to be pancyclic (Bondy 1971) if it contains a cycle of length l for each integer 
l from 3 to |V(G)| inclusive. In this project, we propose a refined property for pancyclic graphs, 
namely double-pancyclicity. Let G be a pancyclic graph with N vertices, and (u1,v1), (u2,v2) be any 
two vertex-disjoint edges in G. Moreover, let l1 and l2 be any two integers of {3,4,…,N-3} such 
9 
 
Let Jr denote the set of positive integers from 3 to r, where r≥3. The following three lemmas 
can be derived from Lemma II.1 and will be useful to prove the main theorem. 
Lemma II.2: (Kung et al. 2010a) Let w be any vertex AQn, n≥2, and l∈J2
n
-1. Suppose that (u,v) 
is any edge in AQn-{w}. Then there exists a cycle C of length l in AQn-{w} such (u,v)∈E(C). 
Lemma II.3 (Hsu et al. 2005): Let n≥2. Suppose that (u1,v1) and (u2,v2) are any two distinct 
edges in AQn. Then there exists a Hamiltonian cycle C in AQn such that (u1,v1)∈E(C) and (u2,v2)
∈E(C). 
Lemma II.4: (Kung et al. 2010a) Assume that n≥3. Let (u1,v1) and (u2,v2) be any two 
vertex-disjoint edges of AQn. Moreover, let l be any integer in J2
n
-2. Then there exists a cycle C of 
length l in AQn-{u1,v1} such that (u2,v2)∈E(C), except for the following two cases: (a) l = 3 if 
{u2,v2} = NAQn(u1)  NAQn(v1); (b) l = 6 if {u2,v2} = V(AQn) -( NAQn(u1)  NAQn(v1) ). 
Using these lemmas we obtain the main theorem as follows. 
Theorem II.5: (Kung et al. 2010a) Assume that n≥3. Let (u1,v1) and (u2,v2) be any two 
vertex-disjoint edges of AQn. Moreover, let l1 and l2 be any two integers in J2
n
-3 with l1+l2≤2
n
. 
Then AQn has two vertex-disjoint cycles, C1 and C2, such that |V(Ci)|=li and (ui,vi)∈E(Ci) for 
i=1,2, except the following two cases: (a) l1=3 or l2=3 when {u2,v2} = NAQn(u1)  NAQn(v1); (b) 
l1=6 or l2=6 when {u2,v2} = V(AQn) -( NAQn(u1)  NAQn(v1) ). 
Applying Theorem II.5, we further study a more important property, panpositionable 
panconnectedness, with respect to augmented cubes.  
A graph G is called almost relay-panpositionable between two distinct vertices x and y if the 
following condition holds: For any vertex zV(G) - {x, y}, for any dG(x, z) ≤ l1 ≤ |V(G)| - dG(y, z) - 
1, and for any dG(y, z) ≤ l2 ≤ |V(G)| - l1 - 1, there exists an [x, y]-path P in G such that P(1) = x, 
P(l1+1) = z, and P(l1+l2+1) = y, except for the case that l1 = l2 = 2 when there just exists a vertex w 
 V(G) – {x, y, z} with {y, w} = NG(x)  NG(z) and {x, w} = NG(y)  NG(z). Then we will call a 
graph G almost panpositionably panconnected if it can be almost relay-panpositionable between 
every pair of distinct vertices. 
Theorem II.6: (Kung et al. 2010b) Suppose that n  3. Then AQn is almost panpositionably 
panconnected. 
 
III. The Hyper-Panconnectedness of Crossed Cubes 
A graph G is said to be panconnected [1] if, for any two distinct vertices x and y, it has a path of 
length l joining x and y for any integer l satisfying dG(x, y)  l  |V(G)| − 1. From the above 
11 
 
called an i-dimensional edge. It is easy to see that y = (x)
i
 if and only if x = (y)
i
. According to the 
adjacency of vertices, we can locate cycles of length 4 and 5 in CQn.  
Lemma III.1: (Fan et al. 2005) Let (x, y) be any n-dimensional edge in CQn, n  3. Then the set of 
vertices {x, y, (x)
2
, (y)
2
} induces a cycle of length 4. 
Lemma III.2: (Fan et al. 2005) Let (x, y) be any n-dimensional edge in CQn, n  3. Then ((x)

)
n
 = 
((y)

 = ((y)

2
. Moreover, (i) the set of vertices { x, y, (x)
1
, (y)
2
, ((y)

} induces a cycle of length 
5; (ii) the set of vertices { x, y, (x)
1
, (y)
1
, ((y)
1
)
2
} induces a cycle of length 5. 
Efe (1992) proposed a shortest path routing algorithm Route(x, y) for CQn. This algorithm 
implies the following two lemmas. 
Lemma III.3: Let x and y be any two distinct vertices of CQn such that x and y are in V(CQ
i 
n−1), i 
 {0, 1}. Then dCQn(x, y) = dCQ
i 
n−1
(x, y). 
Lemma III.4: Let x and y be any two vertices of CQn such that x  V(CQ
0 
n−1) and y  V(CQ
1 
n−1).  
Then dCQ0 n−1(x, (y)
n
) = dCQn(x, y) – 1 or dCQ
1 
n−1
((x)
n
, y) = dCQn(x, y) – 1. 
Fan et al. (2006) have proved that paths of various lengths can be embedded into CQn. 
Lemma III.5: (Fan et al. 2006) Let x and y be any two distinct vertices of CQn. Moreover, let l be 
any integer with dCQn(x, y)  l  2
n
 – 1 and l  dCQn(x, y) + 1. Then there exists a path of length l 
joining x and y in CQn. 
A Hamiltonian graph G is said to be f-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian if G − F remains Hamiltonian 
for every F  V(G)  E(G) with |F|  f.  A Hamiltonian connected graph G is said to be 
f-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected if G − F remains Hamiltonian connected for every F  
V(G)  E(G) with |F|  f. 
Lemma III.6: (Huang et al. 2002) CQn is (n − 2)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and (n − 
3)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected for any integer n, n  3. 
By brute force with a computer program, we can verify the following lemma. 
Lemma III.7: (Chen et al. 2011) Let (x,y) be any 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, or 4-dimensional 
edge of CQ4. Then, CQ4 − {x, y} has a Hamiltonian path between two arbitrary vertices. 
Corollary I.1 is drawn from Lemmas I.6 and I.7. 
Corollary III.1: (Chen et al. 2011) Let (x, y) be any i-dimensional edge of CQn, where n  4 and 
2  i  n. Then CQn − {x, y} has a Hamiltonian path joining any two vertices. 
 
As we have defined, a graph G is hyper-panconnected if, for any two distinct vertices x and y, 
there exists a Hamiltonian path P of G such that dP(x, y) = l for any integer l satisfying dG(x, y)  l 
 |V(G)| − 1. For convenience, we can consider P(1) = x and P(l + 1) = y. However, by the 
13 
 
Proposition IV.1: Suppose that n ≥ 2. Then AQn is panconnected if it is almost panpositionably 
panconnected. 
Proposition IV.2: Let w be any vertex of AQn, n ≥ 2. Suppose that AQk is almost panpositionably 
panconnected for 2  k  n. Then AQn –{w} is panconnected. 
Proposition IV.3: Assume that n ≥ 3. Let (u1,v1) and (u2,v2) be any two vertex-disjoint edges of 
AQn. Moreover, let l1 and l2 be any two integers in {3,4,…,2
n
-3} with l1+l2 ≤ 2
n
. Then AQn has two 
vertex-disjoint cycles, C1 and C2, such that |V(Ci)|=li and (ui,vi)∈E(Ci) for i=1,2, except the 
following two cases: (a) l1=3 or l2=3 when {u2,v2}= NAQn(u1)  NAQn(v1); (b) l1=6 or l2=6 when 
{u2,v2}=V(AQn)-( NAQn(u1)  NAQn(v1)). 
 
V. The Maximum Number of Fault-Free Mutually Independent Hamiltonian Cycles in the 
Faulty Hypercube 
A Hamiltonian graph G is said to be f-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian if      remains 
Hamiltonian for every        with      . A Hamiltonian laceable graph G is said to be 
f-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian laceable if     remains Hamiltonian laceable for every 
       with      . Similarly, a hyper-Hamiltonian laceable graph G is said to be 
f-edge-fault-tolerant hyper-Hamiltonian laceable  if  G – F  remains hyper-Hamiltonian 
laceable for every        with      . 
Lemma V.1: (Tsai et al. 2002) Let n ≥ 3. Then    is (n − 2)-edge-fault-tolerant Hami-ltonian 
and      -edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian laceable. 
Lemma V.2: (Tsai et al. 2002) Let n ≥ 3. Then Qn is (n − 3)-edge-fault-tolerant 
hyper-Hamiltonian laceable. 
Lemma V.3: (Sun et al. 2006) Let n ≥ 4. Suppose that x and y are two arbitrary vertices in 
different partite sets of   . Then          is Hamiltonian laceable. 
Lemma V.4: Let n ≥ 4. Suppose that x and y are any two adjacent vertices in Qn. Then Qn − {x, y} 
is      -edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian laceable.   
Two Hamiltonian paths of a graph G, represented by                      and    
                  , and        for every            ;    and    are fully independent 
if       for every         . A set                  of m Hamiltonian paths of G are 
m-mutually fully independent if    or its any two Hamiltonian paths are fully independent for 
   . 
Lemma V.5: (Sun et al. 2006) Let    be an n-cube for n ≥ 2. Suppose that 
                                            consists of n − 1 distinct edges

Hamiltonian cycles starting from any vertex if        . 
 
三、 討論 
As already mentioned, fault tolerance is an important performance index of interconnection 
networks. Since linear array and rings are two of the most fundamental structures, the node-fault 
and link-fault tolerance are widely investigated for path embedding in various kinds of network 
topologies. By induction, we show that a conditionally faulty Qn, with 2n-5 faulty links, has a 
fault-free path of odd (respectively, even) length in the range from d* to 2
n
-1 between two 
arbitrary nodes of odd (respectively, even) distance d*. 
  Let P(n) denote the probability that every node of an n-cube containing 2n-5 faulty links is 
incident to at least two fault-free links. Then P(n) is computed as follows: P(n)=1 if n=3; 
       
   
 
    
 
   
   
    
 
 if n=4;        
     
     
    
     
 
   
    
     
   
 
   
   
    
 
 if n≥5. One can verify 
that P(n) approaches to 1 as n increases. Thus, the assumption of conditional link-faults is 
probabilistically reasonable. 
In order to thoroughly study the problem of cycle embedding on interconnection networks, we 
define a new property for pancyclic graphs, namely double-pancyclicity, and discuss it with 
respect to the class of augmented cubes. Furthermore, we show that the augmented cubes can be 
almost double-pancyclic. In addition, we explore more important properties about cycle and path 
embedding in a similar way. 
Two new properties for panconnected graphs, called hyper-panconnectedness and 
panpositionable panconnectedness, are defined in this project. We discuss them with respect to the 
class of crossed cubes and augmented cubes, respectively. Recently, Lee et al. (2007) also 
presented a method of constructing a Hamiltonian path in AQn with a required vertex in a fixed 
position. Although Hamiltonian properties have been extensively addressed for many 
interconnection networks, to the best of our knowledge, the augmented cube is the first to be 
verified with the concept of panpositionable panconnectedness. In this sense, our study can be 
thought of as an extension of the previous result. Based on the panpositionable panconnectedness, 
many other properties of augmented cubes, such as pancyclicity, panconnectedness, 
panpositionable Hamiltonicity, etc., can be easily derived too. In other words, our study unifies 
those related researches in a general way. 
In this project, we improve the result of finding mutually independent fault-free Hamiltonian 
cycles in a faulty hypercube, as previously addressed by Hsieh and Yu (2007) and Kueng et al. 
(2009a). Let F denote the set of f faulty edges in n-cube   . Then we show that      has (n − 
f)-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting from any vertex if        . When all 
faulty edges happen to be incident with an identical vertex s, i.e., the minimum degree of the 
survival graph      is equal to     , then      contains no more than ( n− f )-mutually

vertex-disjoint edges in G. Moreover, let lr and l2 be any 
two integers of {3, 4, ... , N - 3} such that lr + l2 ::::: N. 
Then G is said to be double-pancyclic if it has two vertex­
disjoint cycles, C1 and C2, such that IV(Ci)1 = li and 
(Ui, Vi) E E(Ci) for i = 1,2. Furthermore, we aim at 
showing that the augmented cubes, proposed by Choudum 
and Sunitha [3], can be almost double-pancyclic. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec­
tion 2, the definition and the basic properties of augmented 
cubes are introduced. In Section 3, we study the double­
pancyclicity with respect to the class of augmented cubes. 
Finally, the conclusion is given in Section 4. 
2. Preliminaries 
In this section, we first present the definition of the aug­
mented cube and then introduce some of its topological 
properties. 
The n-dimensional augmented cube, denoted by AQn, 
has 2n vertices, each of which corresponds to an n­
bit binary string. It can be defined recursively as fol­
lows: AQI is a complete graph K2 with the vertex set 
{a, I}. For n ;::: 2, let AQ�_l and AQ�_l be two 
copies of AQn-l with V(AQ�_l) = {kUn-lUn-2 ... Ul I 
Ui = a or 1 for 1 ::::: i ::::: n -I} for k E {a, I}. Then 
AQn is constructed by connecting AQ�_l and AQ�_l 
with 2n edges in the following way: A vertex u = 
aUn-lUn-2 ... Ul in AQ�_l is adjacent to a vertex v = 
1Vn-lVn-2 ... VI in AQ�_l if and only if one of the fol-
lowing two conditions holds. 
(i) Ui = Vi for alII::::: i ::::: n - 1. In this case, (u, v) is 
called an n-dimensional hypercube edge. 
(ii) Ui = Vi = 1 - Vi for all 1 ::::: i ::::: n - 1. In this case, 
(u, v) is called an n-dimensional complement edge. 
For the sake of convenience, we denote this recursive con­
struction by AQn = AQ�_l � AQ�_I. The augmented 
cubes AQI, AQ2, and AQ3 are illustrated in Figure 1. It is 
proved in [3] that AQn is vertex-transitive, (2n-1 )-regular, 
(2n -I)-connected, and has diameter I�l 
Some useful notations are defined in advance. Let u = 
Un ... Ui ... UI denote any n-bit binary string representing a 
vertex of AQn. For any index i, 1 ::::: i ::::: n, we use (u)
i and 
(u)i* to denote the binary strings Un ... Ui+IUiUi-I ... Ul 
and Un ... Ui+l UiUi-l ... UI, respectively. Apparently, two 
vertices u and v in AQn are adjacent if and only if there 
is an integer i E {I, 2, ... ,n} such that either (u)i = v or 
(U)i* = v. The following lemma is provided without proof 
because it can be derived from the definition of AQn. 
Lemma 1. Suppose that n ;::: 3. Let u and v be any two ad­
jacent vertices in AQn. If v = (u)
l (i. e. , v = (u)h), then 
the subgraph induced by {u, v, (u)2, (v)2} forms a com­
plete graph K4. Ifv = (u)i with 2 ::::: i ::::: n, then the 
subgraph induced by {u, v, (U)i*, (v)i*} is a K4. ff v = 
(u)n*, then the subgraph induced by {u, v, (u)n, (v)n} is a 
K4. If v = (u)i* with 2 ::::: i::::: n-1, then the subgraphs in­
duced by {u, v, (u)i, (V)i} and {u, v, (u)i+l, (v)i+l} are 
both K4. 
Two subgraphs, HI and H2, of a graph G are vertex­
disjoint if V(HI) n V(H2) = 0. Two [x, yl-paths PI and 
P2 in G are internally vertex-disjoint if V(PI) n V(P2) = 
{ x, y}. Then the following corollary is a direct consequence 
from Lemma 1. 
Corollary 1. Suppose that n ;::: 3. Let u and v be any two 
adjacent vertices in AQn. ff v = (u)n* or v = (U)
i with 
1 ::::: i ::::: n, then there exist two internally vertex-disjoint 
[u, vl-paths of length 2 in AQn. ff v = (U)
i* with 2 ::::: 
i ::::: n - 1, then there exist four internally vertex-disjoint 
[u, v]-paths of length 2 in AQn. 
Lemma 2. [3] Let u and v denote any two vertices in 
AQn with n ;::: 2. Suppose that both u and v are in AQ�_l 
fori E {a,l}. Then dAQn(u, v) = dAQ:'_l(U, v). For 
i E {a, I}, suppose that u is in AQ�_l and v is in AQ��il. 
Then there exist two shortest paths PI and P2 joining u to 
v in AQn such that (V(PI) - {v}) C V(AQ�_l) and 
(V(P2) - {u}) C V(AQ��il). 
Using Lemma 2 we can derive Corollary 2. 
Corollary 2. Let u and v denote any two nonadjacent ver­
tices in AQn with n ;::: 3. Suppose that u is in AQ�_l and 
v is in AQ��il for i E {a, I}. Then there exists a vertex w 
in N AQ��il (v) with dAQn (u, w) = dAQn (u, v) - l. 
Suppose that n :::;. 3. Let (u, v) and (x, y) be any 
two vertex-disjoint edges in AQn. It is easy to see that 
{u, v} = NAQn(X) n NAQn(Y) if and only if {x,y} = 
NAQn (u) n NAQn (v). By Corollary 1, u and v have four 
common neighbors if (u, v) is an i-dimensional comple­
ment edge with 2 ::::: i ::::: n - 1. In this case, we can derive 
that IV(AQn) - (NAQn (u) U NAQn (v))1 = 2n - 4n + 6. 
On the other hand, if (u, v) is not an i-dimensional com­
plement edge for any 2 ::::: i ::::: n - 1, then u and v 
have only two common neighbors. Therefore, we have that

h - 3 and S2 is an [(x)n, (y)n]-path of length 1�1) - 1. 
If 12 � 2n�1 -2, then we set C2 = H; if 12 = 2n�1 - 1, we 
set C2 = ( U2, T1, X, (x)n, (y)n, y, T2, V2, U2); otherwise, 
we set C2 = (U2' T1, X, (x)n, S2, (y)n, y, T2, V2, U2) (see 
Figure 2(c)). Moreover, let C1 = (U1, (U1)n, R, (vdn, V1, 
U1) if 12 = 2n�1 - 1, and let C1 = (U1' (udn, Sl, (V1)n, 
V1, U1) otherwise. Hence C1 and C2 are two vertex-disjoint 
cycles satisfying all requirements. 
Case 2: Suppose that (U1, vd E E(AQ��l) and (U2, V2) E E(AQ;'�d. Without loss of generality, we can assume that h � 12. 
Subcase 2.1: Suppose that 12 � 2n�1. By Lemma 4, 
there exists a cycle C1 of length h in AQ��l such that (U1, V1) E E(C1) , and there exists a cycle C2 of length 
12 in AQ;'�l such that (U2, V2) E E(C2). Obviously, C1 and C2 are two vertex-disjoint cycles satisfying all require­
ments. 
Subcase 2.2: Suppose that 12 :;:. 2n� 1 + 1. This im­
plies h � 2n�1 - 1. Obviously, we only need to consider 
{U2, V2} -=I- V(AQn) - (NAQn(ud U NAQn(V1)). Subcase 2.2.1: Assume that h = 2n�1 + 1. Since 
IV(AQ��l) - {U1, v1} 1 = 2n�
1 - 2 :;:. 2 for n :;:. 3, 
there exists a vertex w E V (AQ�� 1) - {u 1, V 1} such that ((w)n, (w)n*) and (U2, V2) are two different edges. By 
Lemma 6, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle H in AQ;'�l such that ((w)n, (w)n*) E E(H) and (U2, V2) E E(H). 
Without loss of generality, we can write H = (U2' R1, 
(w)n, (w)n*, R2, V2, U2). Obviously, C2 = (U2, R1, 
(w)n, w, (w)n*, R2, V2, U2) is a cycle of length 2n�1 + 1. 
By Lemma 5, there exists a cycle C1 of length 2n�1 - 1 in 
AQ��l - {w}. See Figure 3(a). Subcase 2.2.2: Assume that 12 :;:. 2n� 1 + 2. We can write

12 = 1�0) + 1�1), where 1�0) E ]2n�'-h and 1�
1) E {2n�1 -
1, 2n�1}. By Lemma 4, there exists a cycle S of length 1�1) 
in AQ;'�l such that (U2' V2) E E(S). Let A = {(x, y) E E(S) I {(x)n, (y)n} n {U1, V1} = 0}. Obviously, we have 
IAI :;:. 3 for n :;:. 4. Thus, we can choose an edge (x, y) E A 
such that {(x)n, (y)n} n {U1, vd = 0, {(x)n, (y)n} -=I­
NAQ��l (U1) n NAQ��l (V1), and {(x)n, (y)n} -=I­
V(AQ��l) - (NAQ��l (ud U NAQ��l (V1))' Accord­
ingly, S can be represented as (U2, R1, x, y, R2, V2, 
U2). By the inductive hypothesis, AQ��l has two vertex­disjoint paths, H1 and H2, such that H1 is a [U1, vd­
path of length h - 1 and H2 is an [(x)n, (y)n]-path of 
(0) length 12 - 1. As a result, C1 = (u1,H1, V1, U1) and 
C2 = (U2, R1, x, (x)n, H2, (y)n, y, R2, V2, U2) can be the 
required paths. See Figure 3(b). 
Case 3: Suppose that (U1' V1) E E(AQ��l) and (U2' V2) E E;;. Without loss of generality, we assume that 
U2 E V(AQ��l)' Let w = (V2)(n�
1)*. From the defini­
tion of AQn, w is a common neighbor of U2 and V2. Subcase 3.1: Suppose that h � 2n�1 - 1 and 12 � 
2n�1 + 1. By Lemma 5, there exists a cycle C1 of length 
h in AQ��l - {U2} such that (U1, V1) E E(C1). When 12 = 3, let C2 = (U2, W, V2, U2); when 12 :;:. 4, Lemma 4 
ensures that there exists a [w, v2]-path S of length 12 - 2 
in AQ;'�l' and we can set C2 = (U2' W, S, V2, U2). See Figure 4(a). 
Subcase 3.2: Suppose that 11 :;:. 2n�1 or 12 :;:. 2n�1 + 
2. Firstly we consider that 12 :;:. 2n�1 + 2; this implies 
h � 2n�1 - 2. Let x E NAQ��1(U2) - {u1,vd such 
that {U2,X} -=I- NAQ��l (u1)nNAQ��1 (vd and {U2,X} -=I­
V(AQ��l)-(NAQ�'�l (u1)UNAQ��1 (vd)· Moreover, let 
y = (x)n if V2 = (U2)n, or y = (x)m otherwise. Since 
12 :;:. 2n� 1 + 2, we can write 12 = 1�0) + 1�1) + 1, where 1�0) = 
2n�1 - h and 1�1) E {I, 2, ... , 2n�1 -I}. By the inductive 
hypothesis, AQ��l has two vertex-disjoint paths, H1 and H2, such that H1 is a [U1' v1]-path of length h - 1 and 
H2 is a [U2, xl-path of length 1�0) - 1. Using Lemma 4 we 
have a [y, v2]-path S of length 1�1) in AQ;'�l' Then C1 =

In recent years, many research results on cycle and path embedding have been focused on exploring the properties of
pancyclicity and panconnectedness, respectively [3,7,9,14,16,25,26]. A graph G is called pancyclic [2] if it contains a cycle
of length l for each integer l from 3 to jV(G)j inclusive. More speciﬁcally, a graph G is called edge-pancyclic if its every edge
lies on a cycle of length l for every 3 6 l 6 jV(G)j. On the other hand, a graph G is said to be panconnected [1] if for any two
distinct vertices x and y, it has an [x,y]-path of length l for any integer l satisfying dG(x,y) 6 l 6 jV(G)j  1. It is easy to see that
every panconnected graph must be pancyclic and edge-pancyclic. In order to have insight into the topological properties re-
lated to cycle and path embedding, Kao et al. [12] paid attention to embedding Hamiltonian cycles and proposed an intrigu-
ing property as follows: A graph G is panpositionably Hamiltonian [12] if for any two distinct vertices x and y of G, it contains a
Hamiltonian cycle C such that dC(x,y) = l for any integer k satisfying dG(x,y) 6 l 6 jV(G)j/2. Later, Teng et al. [18] studied the
panpositionable Hamiltonicity with respect to arrangement graphs. Motivated by the concept behind panpositionability, we
propose that a graph G is relay-panpositionable between two distinct vertices x and y if, for any vertex z 2 V(G)  {x,y} and for
any dG(x,z) 6 l1 6 jV(G)j  dG(y,z)  1, there exists an [x,y]-path Pl1 ;l2 of length l1 + l2 in G such that Pl1 ;l2 ð1Þ ¼ x; Pl1 ;l2 ðl1 þ 1Þ ¼
z, and Pl1 ;l2 ðl1 þ l2 þ 1Þ ¼ y for any dG(y,z) 6 l2 6 jV(G)j  l1  1. Furthermore, a graph G is called panpositionably panconnected
if it can be relay-panpositionable between every of its distinct pair of vertices.
The n-cube [17] is one of the most popular networks for parallel and distributed computation. Not only is it ideally suited
to both special-purpose and general-purpose tasks, but it can efﬁciently simulate many other networks [15,24,11]. However,
the n-cube is bipartite. As an enhancement, the augmented cube AQn, proposed by Choudum and Sunitha [6], contains the n-
cube Qn as a subgraph. Not only does AQn retain many attractive characteristics of Qn, but it also possesses some favorable
properties that do not hold for Qn. In this paper, we are investigating the panpositionable panconnectedness with respect to
the class of augmented cubes. As an immediate consequence, many topological properties related to cycle and path embed-
ding in augmented cubes, such as pancyclicity [16], panconnectedness [16], Hamiltonian connectedness [19], etc., can be
drawn from our results.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the deﬁnition of augmented cubes is introduced. In Section 3,
several applications of the panpositionable panconnectedness are presented. Section 4 is to prove our main theorem. Finally,
some concluding remarks are given in Section 5.
2. Preliminaries
In this section, we ﬁrst deﬁne the augmented cube and then introduce some of its structural properties.
The n-dimensional augmented cube, denoted by AQn, has 2n vertices, each of which corresponds to an n-bit binary string.
It can be deﬁned recursively as follows: AQ1 is a complete graph K2 with the vertex set {0,1}. For nP 2, let AQ
0
n1 and AQ
1
n1
be two copies of AQn1 with VðAQkn1Þ ¼ fkun1un2   u1jui ¼ 0 or 1 for 1 6 i 6 n 1g for k 2 {0,1}. Then AQn is constructed
by connecting AQ0n1 and AQ
1
n1 with 2
n edges so that a vertex u = 0un1un2  u1 in AQ0n1 is adjacent to a vertex v = 1vn1vn2
  v1 in AQ1n1 if and only if one of the following two conditions holds:
(i) ui = vi for all 1 6 i 6 n  1, in which case (u, v) is called an n-dimensional hypercube edge;
(ii) ui ¼ v i ¼ 1 v i for all 1 6 i 6 n  1, in which case (u, v) is called an n-dimensional complement edge.
For the sake of convenience, we denote this recursive construction by AQn ¼ AQ0n1AQ1n1. The augmented cubes AQ1,
AQ2, AQ3, and AQ4 are illustrated in Fig. 1. It is proved in [6] that AQn is vertex-transitive, (2n  1)-regular, (2n  1)-connected,
and has diameter dn2e. In recent years, the augmented cube has also received many researchers’ attention [10,19,16].

Proof. Let x and y denote any two distinct vertices in AQn. Moreover, let w be a neighbor of y other than x. Because AQn is
almost panpositionably panconnected, it has an [x, w]-path H such that H(1) = x, H(k + 1) = y, and H(k + 2) =w for any
dAQn ðx; yÞ 6 k 6 2n  2. In other words, there exists an [x,y]-path of length k in AQn for dAQn ðx; yÞ 6 k 6 2n  2. Similarly, there
exists an [x, y]-path S of length 2n  1 such that S(1) = x, S(2n  1) =w, and S(2n) = y. In summary, AQn is panconnected if it is
almost panpositionably panconnected. h
For convenience, we will use Ir to denote the set of positive integers from 1 to r, where rP 2.
Proposition 3. Let w be any vertex of AQn, nP 2. Suppose that AQk is almost panpositionably panconnected for 2 6 k 6 n. Then
AQn  {w} is panconnected.
Proof. Because AQn is vertex-transitive, we can assume that w = 0n. This proposition can be proved by induction on n. Obvi-
ously, AQ2  {00} is panconnected. For nP 3, we assume, as our inductive hypothesis, that AQn1  {0n1} is panconnected.
Let x and y denote any two different vertices in AQn  {w}. Suppose that l is any integer between dAQn ðx; yÞ and 2n  2. Then
we need to construct an [x,y]-path of length l in AQn  {w}.
Firstly we assume that l 6 2n  dAQn ðy;wÞ  1. Because AQn is almost panpositionably panconnected, there exists an [x,
w]-path P in AQn such that P(1) = x, P(l + 1) = y, and P(2n) =w. This implies that there exists an [x,y]-path of length l in
AQn  {w}.
In what follows we are concerned with lP 2n  dAQn ðy;wÞ. Since AQn ¼ AQ0n1AQ1n1, we have to consider the following
three cases.
Case 1: Suppose that x; y 2 VðAQ0n1Þ. Since 2n  dAQn ðy;wÞ  1P 2n  dn2e  1P 2n1 þ 1 for nP 3, we can write
l = l0 + l1 + 1, where l0 = 2n1  2 and l1 2 I2n11. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists an [x,y]-path H of length
l0 in AQ
0
n1  fwg. Obviously, H can be written as hx, z, T, yi, where z is a neighbor of x. By Proposition 2, AQ1n1 is
panconnected if it is almost panpositionably panconnected. Thus, there exists an [(x)n, (z)n]-path S of length l1 in
AQ1n1. Accordingly, P = hx, (x)n, S, (z)n, z, T, yi forms an [x, y]-path of length l in AQn  {w}. See Fig. 2(a).
Case 2: Suppose that x; y 2 VðAQ1n1Þ. Similar to Case 1, we write l = l0 + l1 + 1, where l0 2 I2n12 and l1 = 2n1  1. By Prop-
osition 2, there exists an [x,y]-path S of length l1 in AQ
1
n1. Let A ¼ fðSðiÞ; Sðiþ 1ÞÞj1 6 i 6 l1 and i  1 ðmod2Þg
denote a set of vertex-disjoint edges. Since jAj = 2n2P 2 for nP 3, we can choose an edge (u, v) 2 A with
w R {(u)n, (v)n}. Accordingly, S can be represented as hx, T1, u, v, T2, yi. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists
a [(u)n, (v)n]-path H of length l0 in AQ
0
n1  fwg. Then P = hx, T1, u, (u)n, H, (v)n, v, T2, yi is an [x,y]-path of length
l in AQn  {w}. See Fig. 2(b).
Case 3: Suppose that x 2 VðAQ0n1Þ and y 2 VðAQ1n1Þ. Again, we can write l = l0 + l1 + 1, where l0 2 I2n12 and l1 = 2n1  1.
Obviously, we can pick out a neighbor u of x such that u–w and (u)n– y. Using the inductive hypothesis we get
an [x, u]-path H of length l0 in AQ
0
n1  fwg. By Proposition 2, we have a [(u)n,y]-path S of length l1 in AQ1n1.
Accordingly, P = hx, H, u, (u)n, S, yi is an [x,y]-path of length l in AQn  {w}. See Fig. 2(c).
The proof is completed. h
Proposition 4. Assume that nP 2. Let (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) be any two distinct edges in AQn. Suppose that for 2 6 k 6 n, AQk is
almost panpositionably panconnected. Then there exists a Hamiltonian cycle C in AQn such that (u1, v1) 2 E(C) and (u2, v2) 2 E(C).
Proof. This lemma will be proved by induction on n. It is trivial that the statement is true for n = 2. As the inductive hypoth-
esis, we assume that this lemma holds on AQn1 for nP 3. Firstly we assume that u1 = u2. Because AQn is almost panposi-
tionably panconnected, there exists a [u1, v2]-path P in AQn such that P(1) = u1, P(2) = v1, and P(2n) = v2. The required
Hamiltonian cycle can easily be obtained. In what follows we assume that {u1,v1} \ {u2, v2} = ;. Since AQn ¼ AQ0n1AQ1n1,
the following three cases are distinguished.
Case 1: Suppose that both (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) are n-dimensional edges. Without loss of generality, we assume that
u1;u2 2 VðAQ0n1Þ and v1;v2 2 VðAQ1n1Þ. By Proposition 2, AQn1 is panconnected. Therefore, there exists a

In the following we are concerned with l2P 2n1 + 2. We can write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where lð0Þ2 2 f2n1  l1  3;2n1
l1  2g and lð1Þ2 2 I2n11. By the inductive hypothesis, AQ0n1 has two vertex-disjoint paths, H1 and H2, such that H1 is a [u1,
v1]-path of length l1 and H2 is a [u2, v2]-path of length l
ð0Þ
2 . Obviously, H2 can be represented as hu2,w, T, v2i, wherew is some
vertex adjacent to u2. By Proposition 2, there exists a [(u2)n, (w)n]-path S of length l
ð1Þ
2 in AQ
1
n1. As a result, P1 = H1 and
P2 = hu2, (u2)n, S, (w)n, w, T, v2i can be the required paths. See Fig. 4(b).
Subcase 1.2: Suppose that l1P 3. If l2 6 2n1  3, we let lð0Þ2 ¼ l2; otherwise, we write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where
lð0Þ2 2 f2n1  4;2n1  3g and lð1Þ2 2 I2n1l1 . By the inductive hypothesis, AQ
0
n1 has two vertex-disjoint paths, H1 and H2, such
that H1 = hu1, v1i and H2 is a [u2, v2]-path of length lð0Þ2 . When l2P 2n1  2, we have ‘(H2)P 2n1  4P 4 for nP 4. Hence,
we can pick out an edge (x,y) 2 E(H2) with fðxÞn; ðyÞng– NAQ1n1 ððu1Þ
nÞ \ NAQ1n1 ððv1Þ
nÞ and fðxÞn; ðyÞng – VðAQ1n1Þ
ðNAQ1n1 ððu1Þ
nÞ [ NAQ1n1 ððv1Þ
nÞÞ.
Accordingly, H2 can be represented as hu2, T1, x, y, T2, v2i. Again, the inductive hypothesis ensures that AQ1n1 has two
vertex-disjoint paths, S1 and S2, such that S1 is a [(u1)n, (v1)n]-path of length l1  2 and S2 is an [(x)n, (y)n]-path of length lð1Þ2 . If
l2 6 2n1  3, then we set P2 = H2; otherwise, we set P2 = hu2, T1, x, (x)n, S2, (y)n,y, T2, v2i (see Fig. 4(c)). Moreover, let P1 = hu1,
(u1)n, S1, (v1)n, v1i. Hence, P1 and P2 are two vertex-disjoint paths satisfying all requirements.
Case 2: Suppose that ðu1;v1Þ 2 EðAQ0n1Þ and ðu2;v2Þ 2 EðAQ1n1Þ. Without loss of generality, we can assume that l1 6 l2.
Firstly we consider that l2 6 2n1  1. By Proposition 2, there exists a [u1, v1]-path P1 of length l1 in AQ0n1, and there exists
a [u2, v2]-path P2 of length l2 in AQ
1
n1. Then P1 and P2 are two vertex-disjoint paths satisfying all requirements.
In what follows we consider that l2P 2n1; this implies l1 6 2n1  2. It is noticed that l2P 4 for nP 3. Hence, we only
consider fu2;v2g– VðAQnÞ  ðNAQn ðu1Þ [ NAQn ðv1ÞÞ.
Subcase 2.1: Suppose that l1 = 2n1  2. Thus we have l2 = 2n1. Since jVðAQ0n1Þ  fu1;v1gj ¼ 2n1  2P 2 for nP 3,
there exists a vertex w 2 VðAQ0n1Þ  fu1;v1g such that ((w)n, (w)n*) and (u2, v2) are two different edges. By Proposition 4,
there exists a Hamiltonian cycle C in AQ1n1 such that ((w)
n, (w)n*) 2 E(C) and (u2, v2) 2 E(C). Without loss of generality, we
can write C = hu2, R1, (w)n, (w)n*, R2, v2, u2i. Obviously, P2 = hu2, R1, (w)n, w, (w)n*, R2, v2i is a [u2, v2]-path of length 2n1. By
Proposition 3, there exists a [u1, v1]-path P1 of length 2n1  2 in AQ0n1  fwg. See Fig. 4(d).

for nP 3, path H can be represented as hu1,s, T, v1i. If v2 = (u2)n, then let p = (u1)n and q = (s)n; otherwise, let p = (u1)n* and
q = (s)n*. Obviously, we have v2 R {p,q}. Again, Proposition 3 ensures that there exists a [p, q]-path S of length l

AQ1n1  fv2g. Then P1 = hu1, p, S, q, s, T, v1i and P2 = hu2, v2i are two vertex-disjoint paths satisfying all requirements. See
Fig. 4(h).
Assume that l2P 2. For n = 3, the required paths are listed in Table 2. In the following we suppose that nP 4. By
Proposition 3, there exists a [u1, v1]-path H of length l

n1  fu2g. Let A ¼ fðHðiÞ;Hðiþ 1ÞÞj1 6
i 6 lð0Þ1 and i  1ðmod2Þg be a set of vertex-disjoint edges. Since jAj ¼ d
lð0Þ1

t) 2 A such that {(s)n, (t)n} \ {v2,w} = ; and fðsÞn; ðtÞng– NAQ1n1 ðv2Þ \ NAQ1n1 ðwÞ. Because (v2,w) is not 2-dimensional, we also
have fðsÞn; ðtÞng– VðAQ1n1Þ  ðNAQ1n1 ðv2Þ [ NAQ1n1 ðwÞÞ. Accordingly, H can be written as hu1, T1,s,t, T2, v1i. By the inductive
hypothesis, there exist two vertex-disjoint paths, S1 and S2, in AQ
1
n1 such that S1 is an [(s)
n,(t)n]-path of length lð1Þ1 and S2 is a
[w, v2]-path of length l2  1. Let P1 = hu1, T1,s,(s)n, S1,(t)n,t, T2,v1i and P2 = hu2, w, S2,v2i. See Fig. 4(i) for illustration.
Case 4: Suppose that ðu1;v1Þ 2 Enc and ðu2;v2Þ 2 Enc . Without loss of generality, we assume that l1 6 l2. Furthermore, we
assume that u1 and u2 are in AQ

Subcase 4.1: Suppose that fu2;v2g– NAQn ðu1Þ \ NAQn ðv1Þ. Actually, we also have fu2;v2g \ ðNAQn ðu1Þ \ NAQn ðv1ÞÞ ¼ ; and
fu1;v1g \ ðNAQn ðu2Þ \ NAQn ðv2ÞÞ ¼ ; in this subcase. Let x = (u1)(n1)*,s = (u2)(n1)* and t = (v2)(n1)*. Because the case of 1 6
l1,l2 6 2 is trivial, we only consider that l1P 3 or l2P 3.
Assume that l1 = 1. We write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where lð0Þ2 ; lð1Þ2 2 I2n12. By Proposition 3, there exists a [u2,s]-path H of

S, v2i are two vertex-disjoint paths satisfying all requirements. See Fig. 4(j).
Assume that 2 6 l1 6 2n1  2. We write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where lð0Þ2 2 I2n1l11 and l

q = (p)n; otherwise, we let q = (p)n*. By the inductive hypothesis, there exist two vertex-disjoint paths, H1 and H2, in AQ

such that H1 is a [u1, x]-path of length l1  1 and H2 is a [u2, p]-path of length lð0Þ2 . By Proposition 3, there exists a [q, v2]-path S

requirements. See Fig. 4(k).
Finally, we assume that l1 = 2n1  1. Since l1 6 l2, we have l2 = 2n1  1. By Proposition 3, AQ0n1  fu2g has a [u1,x]-path
H of length 2n1  2, and AQ1n1  fv1g has a [t, v2]-path S of length 2n1  2. Then P1 = hu1, H, x, v1i and P2 = hu2, t, S, v2i are
the required paths.
Subcase 4.2: Suppose that fu2;v2g ¼ NAQn ðu1Þ \ NAQn ðv1Þ. Firstly we assume that l1 = 1. We write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where

2 2 I2n12. Let (u2, s) be any edge in AQ0n1 such that s R {u1, u2}. If v2 = (u2)n, let t = (s)n; otherwise, let t = (s)n*. By
Proposition 3, there exists a [u2,s]-path H of length l

Next we assume that 3 6 l1 6 2n1  1. We write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where lð0Þ2 2 I2n1l1 and l

represented as hw, S1, z, S2, vi. Then Pl1 ;l2 ¼ hx;w; S1; z; S2;v;u;H; yi is a path satisfying all requirements. See
Fig. 5(e).
Subcase 2.2: Suppose that either d1 = 1 or d2 = 1. Without loss of generality, we assume that d1 = 1 and d2P 2. By Lemma
2, there exists a shortest path L joining z to y such that ðVðLÞ  fygÞ  VðAQ1n1Þ. Accordingly, L can be written
as hz, L0, v, yi, where VðL0Þ  VðAQ1n1Þ. Let u = (y)(n1)*. It is clear that u and v are adjacent. Since d2P 2, we
have u– x.
Assume that l1 = 1. We omit the trivial case of l2 = d2. For l2P d2 + 1, we write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where lð0Þ2 2 I2n12 and
d2  1 6 lð1Þ2 6 2n1  1. By Proposition 2, AQ1n1 has a [z, v]-path S of length lð1Þ2 . By Proposition 3, there exists a [u, y]-path H

Assume that l1 = 2. Again, the case of l2 = d2 is omitted. Let s = (x)(n1)*. It is easy to see that {x,s} \ {u,y} = ;. For l2P d2 + 1,
we write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where lð0Þ2 2 I2n13  f2g and d2  1 6 l

2 6 2
n1  1. By Proposition 2, AQ1n1 has a [z, v]-path S of

n1 such that H1 = hx, si and H2 is a [u,y]-
path of length lð0Þ2 . Then Pl1 ;l2 ¼ hx; s; z; S;v;u;H2; yi is a required path. See Fig. 5(g).
Assume that l1P 3. Let ðx;pÞ 2 EðAQ0n1Þ such that p R {u,y} and fx;pg– NAQ0n1 ðuÞ \ NAQ0n1 ðyÞ. Because (u,y) is not 2-
dimensional, we also have fx;pg– VðAQ0n1Þ  ðNAQ0n1 ðuÞ [ NAQ0n1 ðyÞÞ. If z = (x)
n, we let q = (p)n; otherwise, let q = (p)n*.
(a) When l2P 2n1, we write l2 ¼ lð0Þ2 þ lð1Þ2 þ 1, where lð1Þ2 ¼ 2n1  2 and lð0Þ2 2 I2n1l1 . By Proposition 5, there exist two ver-

the inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path S of AQ1n1 such that S(1) = q, S(2) = z, and S(2
n1) = v. For
clarity, S is represented as hq, S1, z, S2, vi. Then we set Pl1 ;l2 ¼ hx;H1;p;q; S1; z; S2;v;u;H2; yi. See Fig. 5(h).

(a) Assume that l2 = d2. By Proposition 3, AQ
1
n1  fyg has an [(s)n,(t)n]-path S of length lð1Þ1 . Then
Pl1 ;l2 ¼ hx; T1; s; ðsÞn; S; ðtÞn; t; T2; z; T3;u; yi is a required path.
(b) Assume that l2P d2 + 1. By Proposition 5, AQ
1
n1 has two vertex-disjoint paths, S1 and S2, such that S1 is an [(s)
n,(t)n]-
path of length lð1Þ1 and S2 is a [v,y]-path of length l2  d2. Then Pl1 ;l2 ¼ hx; T1; s; ðsÞn; S1; ðtÞn; t; T2; z; T3;u;v; S2; yi is a
required path. See Fig. 5(o).
Suppose that u = x. We still write l1 ¼ lð0Þ1 þ lð1Þ1 þ 1. If d2 = 2 and l1 = 2n1, we let lð0Þ1 ¼ 2n1  2 and lð1Þ1 ¼ 1; otherwise, we
let lð0Þ1 ¼ 2n1  d2 þ 1 and lð1Þ1 2 I2n1l2þd21. By Corollary 2, there exists a vertex q in NAQ1n1 ðyÞ with dAQn ðz;qÞ ¼
dAQn ðz; yÞ  1. By Lemma 2, we have a shortest path between z and q of the form hz, L, p, qi, where ‘(L) = d2  2 and
VðLÞ  VðAQ0n1Þ. Because u = x, we have p– x. When p– z, the inductive hypothesis ensures that there exists an [x,p]-path
H in AQ0n1 such that H(1) = x, Hðlð0Þ1 þ 1Þ ¼ z, and Hðlð0Þ1 þ d2  1Þ ¼ p; when p = z, Proposition 2 ensures that AQ0n1 has an
[x,p]-path, still denoted by H, of length lð0Þ1 . For convenience, H is written as hx, T1, z, T2, pi. If q = (p)n, then let
A = {((a)n,(b)n)j(a,b) 2 E(T1) and{(a)n,(b)n} \ {q,y} = ;}; otherwise, let A = {((a)n*,(b)n*)j(a,b) 2 E(T1)and{(a)n*,(b)n*} \ {q,y} = ;}.
Since jAjP 4, we can pick out an edge (s,t) 2 A with fs; tg– NAQ1n1 ðqÞ \ NAQ1n1 ðyÞ and fs; tg–VðAQ

n1Þ  ðNAQ1n1 ðqÞ[
NAQ1n1 ðyÞÞ. If q = (p)
n, we let a = (s)n and let b = (t)n; otherwise, let a = (s)n* and b = (t)n*. Thus H is further represented as
hx; T 01; a;b; T 001; z; T2;pi. By Proposition 5, AQ1n1 has two vertex-disjoint paths, R1 and R2, such that R1 is an [s,t]-path of length
lð1Þ1 and R2 is a [q,y]-path of length l2  d2 + 1. Then Pl1 ;l2 ¼ hx; T 01; a; s;R1; t;b; T 001; z; T2;p;q;R2; yi is a required path. See
Fig. 5(p).
Therefore the proof is completed. h
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a new property for graphs, namely panpositionable panconnectedness, and discuss it with re-
spect to the class of augmented cubes. Let x, y, and z denote any three different vertices in AQn. For any integer l1 satisfying
dAQn ðx; zÞ 6 l1 6 2n  dAQn ðy; zÞ  1, we show that AQn contains an [x,y]-path Pl1 ;l2 such that Pl1 ;l2 ð1Þ ¼ x, Pl1 ;l2 ðl1 þ 1Þ ¼ z, and
Pl1 ;l2 ðl1 þ l2 þ 1Þ ¼ y for any integer l2 satisfying dAQn ðy; zÞ 6 l2 6 2n  l1  1, except in a few special cases. In particular, path
Pl1 ;l2 turns out to be a Hamiltonian path of AQn while l1 + l2 = 2
n  1. Recently, Lee et al. [19] also presented a method of con-
structing a Hamiltonian path in AQn with a required vertex in a ﬁxed position. Although Hamiltonian properties have been
extensively addressed in many interconnection networks, to the best of our knowledge, the family of augmented cubes is the
ﬁrst to be veriﬁed through the concept of panpositionable panconnectedness. In this sense, our study can be thought of as an
extension of previous results. Based on the panpositionable panconnectedness, many other properties of augmented cubes,
such as pancyclicity, panconnectedness, and panpositionable Hamiltonicity, can also be easily derived. In other words, our
study generally uniﬁes past related research.

units in an interconnected system, the panpositionable Hamiltonicity involves more ﬂexi-

1. Introduction
In many parallel and distributed computer systems, processors are connected based on interconnection networks, so the
interconnection network is a critical factor that affects system performance and it is widely addressed by researchers
[14,20,26]. In terms of network analysis, the topological structure of an interconnection network can be modeled as a graph
whose vertices and edges represent processors and communication links, respectively. Among many kinds of network topol-
ogies, the binary n-cube [23] (for short, hypercube) is one of the most popular networks for parallel and distributed compu-
tation. Not only is it ideally suited to both special-purpose and general-purpose tasks, but it can efﬁciently simulate many
other networks [14,20,26]. However, the hypercube is bipartite so that it cannot make the best use of its hardware resources.
For example, the hypercube has the largest diameter among cube family. To compensate for this drawback, many research-
ers [1,7,8,28] try to fashion networks with lower diameters. One such network topology is the crossed cube, which was ﬁrst
proposed by Efe [9]. The crossed cube is derived from the hypercube by changing the connection of some links. Its diameter
is about half of the hypercube’s [6,9]. Besides, the crossed cube has many attractive properties. For example, it has more cy-
cles than the hypercube [12], and binary trees can be embedded into it [18]. Moreover, the embedding of paths of odd and
even lengths [11,13] and the embedding of many-to-many disjoint path covers [22] can be done in the crossed cube. The
deﬁnition of the crossed cube will be presented in the next section.
Throughout this paper, graphs are ﬁnite, simple, and undirected. Some important graph-theoretic deﬁnitions and nota-
tions will be introduced in advance. For those not deﬁned here, however, we follow the standard terminology given by Bondy
and Murty [4]. An undirected graph G is a graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G), where jV(G)j > 0 and
E(G) # {(u,v)j(u,v) is an unordered pair of V(G)}. Two vertices u and v of G are adjacent if (u,v) 2 E(G). The degree of a vertex

Fan et al. [13] proved that, for any two vertices u and v in CQn, there exists a path of length l joining u and v for any integer
l with dCQn ðu;vÞ 6 l 6 2n  1 and l– dCQn ðu;vÞ þ 1.
A Hamiltonian graph G is said to be f-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian if G  F remains Hamiltonian for every F # V(G) [ E(G)
with jFj 6 f. A Hamiltonian connected graph G is said to be f-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected if G  F remains Hamilto-
nian connected for every F # V(G) [ E(G) with jFj 6 f.
Lemma 3 [15]. For any integer n, nP 3, CQn is (n  2)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian and (n  3)-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian
connected.
Any vertex u = unun1  u1 in CQn is said to be adjacent to a vertex v = vnvn1  v1 along the ith dimension, 1 6 i 6 n, if the
following four conditions are all satisﬁed: (i) ui– vi, (ii) uj = vj for all j, i + 1 6 j 6 n, (iii) u2ku2k1  v2kv2k1 for all
k; 1 6 k 6 i12
 
, and (iv) ui1 = vi1 if i is even. Then, we say that u is the i-neighbor of v, denoted by (v)i, and vice versa.
The edge (u, (u)i) is called an i-dimensional edge. It is easy to see that v = (u)i if and only if u = (v)i.
Lemma 4. Let u be any vertex of CQn, nP 3. For any integer i, 1 6 i 6 n  1, ((u)i)n = ((u)n)i if (1) i is even, or (2) i = n  1 with n
even.
Proof. Let u, v, x, y, and z be ﬁve vertices of CQn, where v = (u)n, x = (u)i, y = (v)i, and z = (x)n. Since CQn ¼ CQ0n1  CQ1n1, we
assume, without loss of generality, that u 2 VðCQ0n1Þ. According to the possible values of n and i, we distinguish the follow-
ing three cases.
Case 1. n is even and i = 2j for any j; 1 6 j 6 n12
 
. By the deﬁnition of i-neighbors, we can obtain immediately that yp = zp
for 1 6 p 6 n except p 2 {i, i  1}. Moreover, zizi1  uiui1; yiyi1 ¼ v iv i1, and vivi1  uiui1, where ui denotes the
complement of ui. According to the possible values of ui1, we consider the following two subcases.
Subcase 1.1. ui1 = 0. This results in zizi1 ¼ ui0; v iv i1 ¼ ui0, and yiyi1 ¼ v iv i1 ¼ ui0. It yields y = z.
Subcase 1.2. ui1 = 1. This results in zizi1 ¼ ui1; v iv i1 ¼ ui1; and yiyi1 ¼ v iv i1 ¼ ui1. This also yields y = z. Thus,
((u)i)n = ((u)n)i when n is even and i = 2j for any j; 1 6 j 6 n12
 
.
Case 2. n is even and i = n  1. In this case, by the deﬁnition of i-neighbors, we can derive directly that yp = zp for
1 6 p 6 n  2. Furthermore, ynyn1 ¼ vnvn1 ¼ unun1 and znzn1 ¼ xnxn1 ¼ unun1. This reveals that y = z.
Case 3. n is odd. By a similar argument as that in Case 1, this case holds. This concludes the proof of this lemma. h
Corollary 1. Let (u,v) be any n-dimensional edge in CQn, nP 3. For any integer i, 1 6 i 6 n  1, the set of vertices {u,v, (u)i, (v)i}
induces a cycle of length 4 if (1) i is even, or (2) i = n  1 with n even.
In [12], Fan et al. introduced how to locate a cycle of length 5 as the following lemma.
Lemma 5 [12]. Let (u,v) be any n-dimensional edge in CQn, nP 3. Then, ((u)1)n = ((v)2)1 = ((v)1)2.

Case 2. y 2 VðCQ1n1Þ and (x,y) R E(CQn). The following three subcases are distinguished.
Subcase 2.1. dCQn ðx; yÞ 6 l 6 2n1  1 and l– dCQn ðx; yÞ þ 1. By Lemmas 1 and 2, we have
dCQ0n1 ðx; ðyÞ
nÞ ¼ dCQn ðx; ðyÞnÞ ¼ dCQn ðx; yÞ  1 or dCQ1n1 ððxÞ
n
; yÞ ¼ dCQn ððxÞn; yÞ ¼ dCQn ðx; yÞ  1. Firstly, we assume that
dCQ0n1 ðx; ðyÞ
nÞ ¼ dCQn ðx; yÞ  1. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ0n1 with R(1) = x and
R(l) = (y)n. For clarity, path R is written as hx,R1, (y)n,a,R2,zi, where a and z are vertices in VðCQ0n1Þ  fx; ðyÞng. It is noticed
that a = z if l = 2n1  1. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path S of CQ1n1 joining y to (z)n. Then,
P = hx,R1, (y)n,y,S, (z)n,z,rev(R2),ai is a Hamiltonian path of CQn such that P(1) = x and P(l + 1) = y. This subcase is illustrated
in Fig. 3(a).
Next, we assume that dCQ1n1 ððxÞ
n
; yÞ ¼ dCQn ðx; yÞ  1. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path S of
CQ1n1 with S(1) = (x)
n and S(l) = y. The path S can be written as h(x)n,S1,y,S2,zi, where z is some vertex in
VðCQ1n1Þ  fðxÞn; yg. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ0n1  fxg joining (z)n to any vertex a in
VðCQ0n1Þ  fx; ðzÞng. Then, P = hx, (x)n,S1,y,S2,z, (z)n,R,ai is a Hamiltonian path of CQn such that P(1) = x and P(l + 1) = y. See
Fig. 3(b) for illustration.
Subcase 2.2. 2n1 6 l 6 2n  2. Let h = l  2n1. By Lemma 3, CQ0n1 has a Hamiltonian path R joining x and (y)n. For
convenience, path R is written as hx,R1,a,b,R2, (y)ni, where a and b are two adjacent vertices in CQ0n1 with ‘(R1) = h. It is
noticed that a = x if l = 2n1 and b = (y)n if l = 2n  2. Obviously, CQ1n1 has a Hamiltonian path S joining (a)n to y. Then,
P = hx,R1,a, (a)n,S,y, (y)n,rev(R2),bi is a Hamiltonian path of CQn with P(1) = x and P(l + 1) = y. See Fig. 3(c) for illustration.
Subcase 2.3. l = 2n  1. By Lemma 3, CQn is Hamiltonian connected. Thus, there exists a Hamiltonian path P of CQn joining x
to y.
Case 3. y 2 VðCQ1n1Þ and (x,y) 2 E(CQn). Since (x,y) 2 E(CQn), we have 1 6 l 6 2n  1 and l– 2. When l = 1, it follows from
Lemma 3 that there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQn  {x} joining y to any vertex z, z– x, so that P = hx,y,R,zi is our
required path with P(1) = x and P(2) = y. Thus, we discuss 3 6 l 6 2n  1. The following subcases are distinguished.
Subcase 3.1. l = 3. By Corollary 1, the set of vertices {x,y, (x)2, (y)2} induces a cycle of length 4. By Lemma 3, CQn is (n  3)-
fault-tolerant Hamiltonian connected. Therefore, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQn  {(x)2, (y)2} joining y to x. We can
write R as hy,R0,z,xi, where z is some vertex in V(CQn)  {x,y, (x)2, (y)2}. Then, P = hx, (x)2, (y)2,y,R0,zi is a Hamiltonian path of
CQn such that P(1) = x and P(4) = y. Fig. 4(a) illustrates this subcase.
Subcase 3.2. l = 4. By Lemma 5, the set of vertices {x,y, (x)1, (y)1, ((y)1)2} induces a cycle of length 5. Let v be any vertex in
VðCQ1n1Þ  fy; ðyÞ1; ððyÞ1Þ2g. By Corollary 2, there exists a Hamiltonian path S of CQ1n1  fðyÞ1; ððyÞ1Þ2g joining y to v. By
Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ0n1  fðxÞ1g joining (v)n to x. Path R can be written as h(v)n,R0,u,xi, where
u is some vertex adjacent to x. Therefore, P = hx, (x)1, ((y)1)2, (y)1,y,S,v, (v)n,R0,ui is a Hamiltonian path of CQnwith P(1) = x and
P(5) = y. The illustration of this subcase is shown in Fig. 4(b).
Subcase 3.3. 5 6 l 6 2n1. Let h = l  2. Then, we have 3 6 h 6 2n1  2. By Corollary 1, the set of vertices {x,y, (x)2, (y)2}
induces a cycle of length 4. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ0n1 such that R(1) = (x)
2
and R(h + 1) = x. For clarity, path R is written as h(x)2,R1,x,v,R2,zi, where v and z are two vertices in VðCQ0n1Þ  fx; ðxÞ2g.
It is noticed that v = z if h = 2n1  2. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path S of CQ1n1  fðyÞ2g joining y to (z)n. Then,
P = hx,rev(R1), (x)2, (y)2,y,S, (z)n,z,rev(R2),vi is a Hamiltonian path of CQn with P(1) = x and P(l + 1) = y, see Fig. 4(c) for
illustration.

Subcase 1.2. l = 2n1. Let a = (x)n. Obviously, we can choose an even integer i, 1 6 i 6 n  1, such that (x)i is not identical to y.
By Corollary 1, {x,a, (x)i, (a)i} induces a cycle of length 4. Let b be a neighbor of x in CQ0n1 such that b R {(x)
1, (x)i,y}. By Cor-
ollary 2, CQ0n1  fx;bg has a Hamiltonian path R joining (x)i and y. Similarly, CQ1n1  fa; ðaÞig has a Hamiltonian path S join-
ing (y)n and (b)n. Then, C = hx,a, (a)i, (x)i,R,y, (y)n,S, (b)n,b,xi is a Hamiltonian cycle of CQn with dC(x,y) = 2n1, see Fig. 5 for
illustration.
Case 2. y 2 VðCQ1n1Þ and (x,y) R E(CQn). By Lemmas 1 and 2, we have dCQ0n1 ðx; ðyÞ

dCQn ðx; yÞ  1. For convenience, let h = l  1.
Suppose that dCQ0n1 ðx; ðyÞ
nÞ ¼ dCQn ðx; yÞ  1. Since dCQ0n1 ðx; ðyÞ
nÞ 6 h 6 2n1  1 and h – dCQ0n1 ðx; ðyÞ
nÞ þ 1, Theorem 1 en-
sures that there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQ0n1 with R(1) = (y)
n and R(h + 1) = x. For convenience, path R is written
as h(y)n,R1,x,R2,zi, where z is some vertex in VðCQ0n1Þ  fðyÞng. It is noticed that z = x if h = 2n1  1. By Lemma 3, there exists
a Hamiltonian path S of CQ1n1 joining y to (z)
n. Then, C = hx,rev(R1), (y)n,y,S, (z)n,z,rev(R2),xi is a Hamiltonian cycle of CQn
such that dC(x,y) = h + 1 = l. The illustration of this subcase is shown in Fig. 6(a).
Suppose that dCQ1n1 ððxÞ

there exists a Hamiltonian path S of CQ1n1 with S(1) = (x)
n and S(h + 1) = y. Path S can be written as h(x)n,S1,y,S2,zi, where
z is some vertex in VðCQ1n1Þ  fðxÞng. It is noticed that z = y if h = 2n1  1. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path
R of CQ0n1 joining (z)
n to x. Then, C = hx, (x)n,S1,y,S2,z, (z)n,R,xi is a Hamiltonian cycle of CQn such that dC(x,y) = h + 1 = l,
see Fig. 6(b) for illustration.
Case 3. y 2 VðCQ1n1Þ and (x,y) 2 E(CQn). Since (x,y) 2 E(CQn), we have 1 6 l 6 2n1 and l– 2. When l = 1, it follows from
Lemma 3 that there exists a Hamiltonian path R of CQn joining y to x, and C = hx,y,R,xi is our required cycle with dc(x,y) = 1.
Therefore, we discuss 3 6 l 6 2n1. The following three subcases are distinguished.
Subcase 3.1. l = 3. As described in the proof of Subcase 3.1 of Theorem 1, we can construct a Hamiltonian cycle
C = hx, (x)2, (y)2,y,R,z,xi of CQn with dC(x,y) = 3.
Subcase 3.2. l = 4. By using the same argument as that in Subcase 3.2 of Theorem 1, we can construct a Hamiltonian cycle
C = hx, (x)1, ((y)1)2, (y)1,y,S,v, (v)n,R0,u,xi of CQn with dC(x,y) = 4.
Subcase 3.3. 5 6 l 6 2n1. This subcase is the same as Subcase 3.3 of Theorem 1, and C = hx,rev(R1), (x)2, (y)2,

The star graph interconnection network has been recognized as an attractive alternative to the hypercube
for its nice topological properties. Unlike previous research concerning the issue of embedding exactly
one Hamiltonian cycle into an injured star network, this paper addresses the maximum number of fault-
free mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles in the faulty star network. To be precise, let SGn denote
an n-dimensional star network in which f ≤ n − 3 edges may fail accidentally. We show that there exist
(n − 2 − f )-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles rooted at any vertex in SGn if n ∈ {3, 4}, and there
exist (n − 1 − f )-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles rooted at any vertex in SGn if n ≥ 5.

1. Introduction
The problem of finding Hamiltonian cycles in a graph is well known to be NP-complete and
has been discussed in many areas. In 1969, Lovasz [27] asked whether every finite connected
vertex-transitive graph has a Hamiltonian path, that is, a simple path that traverses every vertex
exactly once.
Definition 1 [4] A graph is said to be vertex-transitive if for every pair u, v of vertices, there
exists an automorphism of the graph that maps u into v. A graph is said to be edge-transitive if
for any two edges a and b, there exists an automorphism of the graph that maps a into b.
All known vertex-transitive graphs have a Hamiltonian path, but only four vertex-transitive
graphs without any Hamiltonian cycle are known to exist. Since none of these four graphs

the sequence x W1 y W2 z, obtained by concatenating W1 and W2 at y, is a walk. A walk of length
0 consists of a single vertex. A path is a walk in which no vertex is repeated. For convenience, the
ith vertex of a path P is denoted by P(i). For any two vertices u and v in a graph G, the distance
between u and v, denoted by dG(u, v), is the length of the shortest path between u and v. A cycle
is a walk v1v2 · · · vn+1 in which n ≥ 3, v1 = vn+1, and the n vertices v1, v2, . . . , vn are distinct.
A path (or cycle) in a graph G is a Hamiltonian path (or Hamiltonian cycle) of G if it spans G.
A graph is Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian cycle. A bipartite graph is Hamiltonian laceable
[34] if there exists a Hamiltonian path between any two vertices that are in different partite sets. A
Hamiltonian laceable graph G is said to be hyper-Hamiltonian laceable [22] if, for any i ∈ {0, 1}
and for any vertex v ∈ Vi(G), there exists a Hamiltonian path in G − {v} between any two vertices
of V1−i (G).
Let G be a graph with N vertices. A rooted Hamiltonian cycle C in G can be described as v1
v2 · · · vN v1 to emphasize the order of vertices on C. Accordingly, v1 is seen as the root vertex, and
vi is seen as the ith vertex on C. Two Hamiltonian cycles rooted at a given vertex s of G, namely
C1 := v1v2 · · · vNv1 and C2 := u1u2 · · · uNu1 with v1 = u1 = s, are independent if vi = ui for
2 ≤ i ≤ N . A collection of m Hamiltonian cycles C1, . . . , Cm in G, rooted at the same vertex, are
said to be m-mutually independent if Ci and Cj are independent whenever i = j . Moreover, the
mutually independent Hamiltonicity of G, denoted by IHC(G), is defined to be the maximum
integerm such that for any vertex v ofG, there exists a set ofm-mutually independent Hamiltonian
cycles rooted at v in G. The concept of mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles can be applied
in many different areas [12,15,16,25,26,33].
3. The star graph
The hypercube has long been one of the most popular network topologies [21] because of its nice
topological properties. The star graph, proposed by Akers and Krishnamurthy [1], is an attractive
alternative to the hypercube for interconnecting processors in parallel computers. Since then, star
networks have received many researchers’ attention. For example, the diameter and fault diameter
were computed in [1,20,32]. Moreover, Fragopoulou and Akl [8,9] studied how to embed directed
edge-disjoint spanning trees into the star graph. The Hamiltonian properties of star graphs are
addressed in [13,14,23,38]. In particular, because processors or links may fail accidentally to affect
network performance, Tseng et al. [38] addressed fault-tolerant ring embedding in an injured star
network if no more than n − 3 edge faults occur.
The definition of star graphs is described as follows. Let n be any positive integer. For conve-
nience, we use In to denote the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. A permutation u1u2 · · · un on In is a sequence
of all elements of In. Every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions. An even
permutation (respectively, odd permutation) is a permutation that can be written as a product
of an even (respectively, odd) number of transpositions. The n-dimensional star graph SGn is
a graph whose vertex set is the set of all permutations on In. Two vertices, u1 · · · ui · · · un and
v1 · · · vi · · · vn, are adjacent through an edge of dimension i with 2 ≤ i ≤ n if u1 = vi , v1 = ui ,
and uj = vj for j ∈ In − {1, i}. Clearly, SGn is (n − 1)-regular with n! vertices. Moreover, it is
precisely a Cayley graph of the symmetric group with edge set consisting of all the transpositions
of form (1 i), where 2 ≤ i ≤ n. So it is vertex-transitive and edge-transitive [1]. The star graphs
SG2, SG3, and SG4 are illustrated in Figure 1.
For the sake of clarity, we use boldface letters to denote vertices of SGn. Moreover, we use e to
denote the vertex 12, . . . , n. It is known that SGn is a bipartite graph with one partite set V0(SGn)
consisting of all the even permutations and the other partite set V1(SGn) consisting of all the odd
permutations. Let u = u1u2 · · · un be a vertex in SGn. Then ui is the ith coordinate of u, denoted

t ∈ {0, 1}. Then there exists a Hamiltonian path H := x1P1y1x2P2y2 · · · xrPryr in SGIn − F such
that x1 = u, yr = v, andPi is a Hamiltonian path of SG{ai }n − F joining xi to yi for every 1 ≤ i ≤ r .
Proof Without loss of generality, we can assume that t = 0. Since SG{a1}n is isomorphic to
SGn−1, this statement holds for r = 1 by Theorem 2. Thus, suppose that r ≥ 2 and set x1 = u
and yr = v. By Lemma 1, there are ((n − 2)!/2) > n − 4 pairwise disjoint edges joining vertices
of V1(SG{ai }n ) to vertices of V0(SG{ai+1}n ) for every i ∈ Ir−1. Therefore, we can choose {yi , xi+1} ∈
Eai,ai+1 − F with yi ∈ V1(SG{ai }n ) and xi+1 ∈ V0(SG{ai+1}n ) for i ∈ Ir−1. By Theorem 2, SG{ai }n − F
has a Hamiltonian path Pi joining xi to yi for every i ∈ Ir . As a result, the sequence of vertices,
x1 P1 y1 x2 P2 y2 · · · xr Pr yr , forms a desired Hamiltonian path of SGIn − F joining u to v. 
Lemma 4 Let n ≥ 5. Assume that F ⊂ E(SGn) with |F | ≤ n − 4, and |F ∩ SG{i}n | ≤ n − 5 for
every i ∈ In. Moreover, assume that I = {a1, . . . , ar} is an r-element subset of In for any 2 ≤ r ≤
n. Suppose that u ∈ Vt(SG{a1}n ), w ∈ V1−t (SG{a1}n ), and v ∈ Vt(SG{ar }n ) for any t ∈ {0, 1}. Then
there exists a Hamiltonian path H of (SGIn − F) − {w} joining u to v.
Proof Without loss of generality, we can assume that t = 0. By Lemma 1, there are (n − 2)!/2 >
n − 3 pairwise disjoint edges joining vertices of V0(SG{a1}n ) to vertices of V1(SG{a2}n ). Thus, we
can choose a vertex x of V0(SG{a1}n ) − {u} with (x)1 = a2 and {x, (x)n} /∈ F . By Theorem 2, there
exists a Hamiltonian path P of (SG{a1}n − F) − {w} joining u to x. By Lemma 3, there exists a
Hamiltonian path Q of SGI−{a1}n − F joining (x)n to v. As a result, the sequence of vertices, u P
x (x)n Q v, forms a desired Hamiltonian path. 
Lemma 5 [24] Let w and b denote two adjacent vertices of SGn with n ≥ 4. For any vertex u
in Vt(SGn) − {w,b}, t ∈ {0, 1}, and for any i ∈ In, there exists a Hamiltonian path P of SGn −
{w,b} joining u to some vertex v in V1−t (SGn) − {w,b} with (v)1 = i.
Lemma 6 Let i ∈ In and F ⊂ E(SGn) with |F | ≤ n − 4 for n ≥ 4. Suppose that w and b are
two adjacent vertices of SGn, and u ∈ Vt(SGn) − {w,b} for any t ∈ {0, 1}. Then there exists a
Hamiltonian path of (SGn − F) − {w,b} joining u to some vertex v of V1−t (SGn) − {w,b} with
(v)1 = i.
Proof Without loss of generality, we can assume that t = 0. Since SGn is vertex-transitive, we
can assume that w = e and b = (e)j with some j ∈ In − {1}. We set Fk = F ∩ E(SG{k}n ) for
every k ∈ In. The proof is done by induction on n. The induction basis, that is, the case n = 4,
follows from Lemma 5. Suppose that this statement holds for SGn−1 with n ≥ 5. We consider
the dimensions of all edges in F ∪ {{e, (e)j }}. If there is an edge in F whose dimension, say j ′,
is different from j , then SGn can be partitioned into n vertex-disjoint subgraphs with the j ′th
coordinate of each vertex (that is, the subgraph of SGn induced by the vertices with the same j ′th
coordinate is SGn−1). Otherwise, every edge of F has the same dimension j .
Case 1 The dimension j ′ exists. Without loss of generality, we can assume that j ′ = n. Thus,
we have {e, (e)j } ∈ E(SG{n}n ) and |Fk| ≤ n − 5 for every k ∈ In.
Subcase 1.1 Suppose that u ∈ V0(SG{n}n ). Since |F | ≤ n − 4, we can choose an integer r ∈
In−1 such that |F ∩ Er,n| = 0. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path P
of (SG{n}n − Fn) − {e, (e)j } joining u to a vertex x ∈ V1(SG{n}n ) with (x)1 = r . We can choose
a vertex v in V1(SGIn−1−{r}n ) with (v)1 = i. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path Q of
SGIn−1n − F joining (x)n to v. Then the sequence of vertices, uPx(x)nQv, is a desired path.

Subcase 2.3.2 Suppose that i = (y)1. Let k3 = (y)1. Then the proof of this case happens to
be similar to that of Subcase 2.3.1. Thus, we omit the details. 
Lemma 7 Let {a, b} ⊂ In with a < b, and let F ⊂ E(SGn) with |F | ≤ n − 4 for n ≥ 4. Suppose
that x ∈ V0(SGn), and x1 and x2 are two distinct neighbours of x. Then there exists a Hamiltonian
path of (SGn − F) − {x, x1, x2} between two vertices u and v inV0(SGn) − {x} such that (u)1 = a
and (v)1 = b.
Proof Since SGn is vertex-transitive, we can assume that x = e, x1 = (e)i1 , and x2 = (e)i2 with
some {i1, i2} ⊂ {2, 3, . . . , n}. Then this lemma is proved by induction on n.
Suppose that n = 4. Thus, we have |F | = 0. Since SG4 is edge-transitive, we can assume that
x1 = (e)2 = 2134 and x2 = (e)3 = 3214. The required paths of SG4 − {1234, 2134, 3214} are
listed in Table 1.
Suppose that the statement holds for SGn−1 with n ≥ 5. Let Fk = F ∩ E(SG{k}n ) for every
k ∈ In. Without loss of generality, suppose that F contains at least one edge of dimension n.
Thus, we have |Fk| ≤ n − 5 for every k ∈ In. Because a < b, we have a = n and b = 1. Since
|F | ≤ n − 4, we can choose an integer c in In−1 − {1, a} such that |F ∩ Ec,n| = 0. Moreover, we
can choose a vertex v of V0(SG{1}n ) with (v)1 = b.
Case 1 Suppose that i1 = n and i2 = n. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a Hamil-
tonian path H of (SG{n}n − Fn) − {e, (e)i1 , (e)i2} joining a vertex u of V0(SG{n}n ) with (u)1 = a
to a vertex y of V0(SG{n}n ) with (y)1 = c. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path R of
SGIn−1n − F joining (y)n to v. As a result, the sequence of vertices, u H y (y)n R v, forms a desired
path in (SGn − F) − {e, (e)i1 , (e)i2}.
Case 2 Either i1 = n or i2 = n. Without loss of generality, we can assume that i2 = n. We
choose a vertex u ∈ V0(SG{n}n ) with (u)1 = a. By Lemma 6, there exists a Hamiltonian path H
of (SG{n}n − Fn) − {e, (e)i1} joining a vertex u to some vertex y of V1(SG{n}n ) with (y)1 = c. By
Lemma 4, there exists a Hamiltonian path Q of (SGIn−1n − F) − {(e)n} joining (y)n to v. As a
result, the sequence of vertices, u H y (y)n Q v, is a desired path. 
4. Mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles in faulty star graphs
Lin et al. [25] showed the next theorem.
Theorem 3 [25] IHC(SG3) = 1, IHC(SG4) = 2, and IHC(SGn) = n − 1 if n ≥ 5.
For the sake of clarity, our main result, Theorem 4, will be divided into three lemmas
(Lemma 8–10).
Lemma 8 Let f ∈ E(SG4). Then IHC(SG4 − {f }) = 1.
Proof Since SG4 is edge-transitive, we can assume that f = {1234, 4231}. By Theorem 1, there
exists a Hamiltonian cycle in SG4 − {f }. Thus, we have IHC(SG4 − {f }) ≥ 1. To show that
IHC(SG4 − {f }) ≤ 1, it suffices to point out that there will be no two-mutually independent
Hamiltonian cycles rooted at vertex 1234. In Table 2, we list all Hamiltonian cycles of SG4 − {f }
rooted at 1234. By brute force, we can check that there do not exist two-mutually independent
Hamiltonian cycles. Hence, the proof is completed. 

Lemma 9 Suppose that n ≥ 5 and F ⊂ E(SGn) with |F | = n − 3. Let u ∈ V (SGn). Then there
exist two-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles rooted at u in SGn − F .
Proof Because SGn is edge-transitive, there exists an automorphism φ1 of SGn mapping any
edge in F into an edge of dimension n. For convenience, let w = φ1(u). Moreover, let φ2 :
V (SGn) → V (SGn) be a function defined as follows: φ2(v) = h((v)1)h((v)2), . . . , h((v)n) for
any v ∈ V (SGn), where h : In → In is a function such that h((w)j ) = j for each j ∈ In. Clearly,
φ2 is also an automorphism of SGn. It is easy to check that the composition of φ1 and φ2, namely
φ2 ◦ φ1, is an automorphism of SGn such that φ2 ◦ φ1(u) = e. For this reason, we can assume that
u = e, and F contains at least one edge of dimension n. Let Fk = F ∩ E(SG{k}n ) for every k ∈ In.
As a result, we have |Fk| ≤ n − 4 for every k ∈ In.
Case 1 Suppose that {e, (e)n} /∈ F . Let B = (bi,j ) be a 2 × n matrix with
bi,j =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨

j if i = 1,
n if i = 2 and j = 1,
j + 1 if i = 2 and 2 ≤ j ≤ n − 2,
2 if i = 2 and j = n − 1,
1 if i = 2 and j = n.
By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian path P of SG
⋃n
j=1{b1,j }
n − F joining (e)n to e. Similarly,
there exists a Hamiltonian path H of SG

(e)n P e and C2 := e H (e)n e. Obviously, {C1, C2} forms a set of two-mutually independent
Hamiltonian cycles rooted at e in SGn − F (see Figure 2(a) for illustration).
Case 2 Suppose that {e, (e)n} ∈ F and |Fn| = n − 4. Obviously, we have |Fk| = 0 for

a Hamiltonian path Qk of SG{ik}n − Fik joining (yk−1)n to yk for 3 ≤ k ≤ n − 2. We set
C2 := e(e)in−1((e)in−1)nQn−1yn−1(yn−1)nQ2y2(y2)nQ3y3(y3)n · · · (yn−2)nQ1(w)nwR−1e.
As a result, {C1, C2} turns out to be a set of two-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles
rooted at e in SGn − F . Figure 2(c) illustrates C1 and C2 in S5. 
Lemma 10 Let f be any integer of In−4 for n ≥ 5. Suppose that F ⊂ E(SGn) with |F | = f , and
u is any vertex of SGn. Then there exist (n − 1 − f )-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles
rooted at u in SGn − F .
Proof As explained in the proof of Lemma 9, there exists an automorphism of SGn that can map
any edge in F into an edge of dimension n and map u to e simultaneously. Hence, we can assume
that u = e, and F contains at least one edge of dimension n. Let Fk = F ∩ E(SG{k}n ) for every
k ∈ In. Thus, we have |Fk| ≤ n − 5 for every k ∈ In. Moreover, let A1 = E1,n − {{e, (e)n}}, and
let Ai = Ei,n ∪ {{e, (e)i}} for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1.
Case 1 Suppose that {e, (e)n} ∈ F . It is noticed that there are at least n − 1 − f elements of
|F ∩ A2|, |F ∩ A3|, . . . , |F ∩ An−1| equal to 0. Without loss of generality, we can assume that
|F ∩ (∪n−1i=f+1Ai)| = 0. Thus, at least one of |F ∩ A1|, . . . , |F ∩ Af | equals to 0.
Subcase 1.1 Suppose that |F ∩ A1| = 0. Let B = (bi,j ) be an (n − 1 − f ) × n matrix with
bi,j =
{
f + i + j if f + i + j ≤ n,
f + i + j − n otherwise.
It is noticed that bi,n−f−i = n for every 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 − f . Then we will construct a set of (n −
1 − f )-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles {C1, C2, . . . , Cn−1−f } rooted at e in SGn − F .
Let i ∈ In−2−f . We set ti = n − f − i. By Lemma 7, there exists a Hamiltonian path Qi of
(SG{bi,ti }n − Fbi,ti ) − {e, (e)bi,1 , (e)bi,n} joining two vertices xi and yi in V0(SG
{bi,ti }
n ) − {e} such that
(xi )1 = bi,ti−1 and (yi )1 = bi,ti+1. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian pathPi of SG
∪ti−1j=1 {bi,j }
n −
F joining ((e)bi,1)n to (xi )n. Similarly, there exists a Hamiltonian path Ri of SG∪
n
j=ti+1{bi,j }
n − F
joining (yi )n to ((e)bi,n )n. Then we set Ci := e (e)bi,1 ((e)bi,1)n Pi (xi )n xi Qi yi (yi )n Ri ((e)bi,n )n
(e)bi,n e.
By Lemma 6, (SG{bn−1−f,1}n − Fbn−1−f,n ) − {e, (e)bn−1−f,n} has a Hamiltonian path T joining (e)b1,n
to a vertex z ofV0(SG
{bn−1−f,1}
n ) − {e}with (z)1 = bn−1−f,2. By Lemma 3, there exists a Hamiltonian
path W of SG∪
n
j=2{bn−1−f,j }
n − F joining (z)n to ((e)bn−1−f,n )n. Then we set Cn−1−f := e (e)b1,n T z
(z)n W ((e)bn−1−f,n )n (e)bn−1−f,n e.
As a result, {C1, . . . , Cn−2−f , Cn−1−f } turns out be a set of (n − 1 − f )-mutually independent
Hamiltonian cycles rooted at e in SGn − F . Figure 3 illustrates {C1, C2, C3, C4} in SG6 − F with
|F | = f = 1.
Subcase 1.2 Suppose that |F ∩ A1| > 0. It is noticed that f ≥ 2 in this subcase. Thus, at
least one of |F ∩ A2|, . . . , |F ∩ Af | equals to 0. Without loss of generality, we can assume that

e(e)b2,nT (z3)

n · · · zn−2Hn−2(zn−1)nzn−1Hn−1(e)ne.
Consequently, {C1, C2, . . . , Cn−2−f , Cn−1−f } is a set of (n − 1 − f )-mutually independent
Hamiltonian cycles rooted at e in SGn − F . Figure 4(a) illustrates {C1, C2, C3, C4} in SG6 − F

By Lemma 1, there are (n − 2)!/2 > n − 3 pairwise disjoint edges joining vertices of

cannot exceed n − 3. For this reason, we can make a more general condition on the nature of faulty
edges such that every vertex still has at least two neighbours in a faulty star graph. This kind of sets
of faulty edges is called conditionally faulty. Let F ⊂ E(SGn) be conditionally faulty. Then we
believe that mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles can be constructed in SGn if |F | ≤ 3n − 10.
These results convince us that the star graph is really robust enough to interconnect computing
units in parallel and distributed systems.

On the maximum number of fault-free mutually
independent Hamiltonian cycles in the faulty hypercube
Tzu-Liang Kung · Cheng-Kuan Lin ·

© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012
Abstract Hsieh and Yu (2007) first claimed that an injured n-dimensional hypercube
Qn contains (n − 1 − f )-mutually independent fault-free Hamiltonian cycles, where
f ≤ n − 2 denotes the total number of permanent edge-faults in Qn for n ≥ 4, and
edge-faults can occur everywhere at random. Later, Kueng et al. (2009a) presented
a formal proof to validate Hsieh and Yu’s argument. This paper aims to improve
this mentioned result by showing that up to (n − f )-mutually independent fault-free
Hamiltonian cycles can be embedded under the same condition. Let F denote the set
of f faulty edges. If all faulty edges happen to be incident with an identical vertex s,
i.e., the minimum degree of the survival graph Qn −F is equal to n−f , then Qn −F
contains at most (n − f )-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting from s.
From such a point of view, the presented result is optimal. Thus, not only does our
improvement increase the number of mutually independent fault-free Hamiltonian
cycles by one, but also the optimality can be achieved.

Kueng et al. 2009b; Kung et al. 2009; Leighton 1992; Leu and Kuo 1999; Tsai et al.
2002; Yang et al. 1994). The formal definition of an n-cube is given below. For the
sake of clarity, let a boldface letter u denote an n-bit binary string bn · · ·bi · · ·b1.
For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we use (u)i to denote the binary string bn · · · b¯i · · ·b1. Moreover,
we use (u)i to denote the ith bit bi of u. The Hamming weight of u, denoted by
wH(u), is |{i | (u)i = 1,1 ≤ i ≤ n}|. The n-cube Qn contains 2n vertices, each
of which is labeled by an n-bit binary string. For the purpose of notation consis-
tency, its vertices are also denoted by boldface letters in the rest of this paper. Two
vertices u and v of Qn are adjacent if and only if v = (u)i for some i, and edge
(u, (u)i) is called i-dimensional. Clearly, Qn is a bipartite graph with partite sets
V0(Qn) = {u ∈ V (Qn) | wH(u) is even} and V1(Qn) = {u ∈ V (Qn) | wH(u) is odd}.
Sun et al. (2006) first addressed the problem of finding mutually independent
Hamiltonian cycles on the n-cube for n ≥ 3. Later, Hsieh and Yu (2007) claimed
that an injured n-cube contains (n − 1 − f )-mutually independent fault-free Hamil-
tonian cycles, and Kueng et al. (2009a) gave a formal proof to validate this claim,
where f ≤ n − 2 is the total number of permanent edge-faults that can occur ev-
erywhere at random to injure the n-cube. To be precise, we have to introduce the
definition of mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles in advance. Let G be a graph
with N vertices. A Hamiltonian cycle C of G is represented by 〈u1, u2, . . . , uN ,u1〉,
where u1 is referred to as the start vertex of C. Naturally every vertex of C can serves
as the start one. Two Hamiltonian cycles of G, namely C1 = 〈u1, u2, . . . , uN ,u1〉
and C2 = 〈v1, v2, . . . , vN , v1〉, are internally independent if u1 = v1 and ui = vi for
2 ≤ i ≤ N . A set {C1,C2, . . . ,Cm} of m Hamiltonian cycles of G is m-mutually in-
dependent if and only if any two of them are internally independent for m ≥ 2. The
concept of mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles can be applied in many different
areas like those introduced in Hsieh and Yu (2007), Kueng et al. (2008), Kung et al.
(2011), Lin et al. (2012), Shih et al. (2010a, 2010b), Su et al. (2011a, 2011b), Sun
et al. (2006). This paper aims to improve the mentioned result (Hsieh and Yu 2007;
Kueng et al. 2009a) by showing that Qn has up to (n − f )-mutually independent
fault-free Hamiltonian cycles, starting from any vertex, when f ≤ n − 2 edges are
faulty.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The basic properties of hypercubes
are introduced in Sect. 2. Our main theorem is presented in Sect. 3. Finally, some
concluding remarks are given in Sect. 4.
2 Preliminaries
By definition, the n-cube Qn has a recursive construction; that is, it can be decom-
posed into two (n − 1)-dimensional hypercubes. Let Qd,jn denote the subgraph of
Qn induced by {u ∈ V (Qn) | (u)d = j} for 1 ≤ d ≤ n and j ∈ {0,1}. Obviously,
Q
d,j
n is isomorphic to Qn−1. Then the d-partition of Qn decomposes Qn along the
d th dimension into Qd,0n and Qd,1n . The set of crossing edges between Qd,0n and
Q
d,1
n , denoted by Edc = {(u,v) ∈ E(Qn) | u ∈ V (Qd,0n ),v ∈ V (Qd,1n )}, consists of

3 Mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles
The mutually independent Hamiltonicity of a graph G, denoted by I H C(G), is de-
fined as the maximum integer m such that for any vertex v ∈ V (G), there exist m-
mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles of G starting from v.
Theorem 1 (Sun et al. 2006) I H C(Qn) = n−1 if n ≤ 3, and I H C(Qn) = n if n ≥ 4.
The last lemma and theorem show that Qn contains (n−f )-mutually independent
fault-free Hamiltonian cycles, where f denotes the total number of faulty edges in
Qn for f ≤ n − 2 and n ≥ 4.
Lemma 7 Suppose that F denotes any set of f edges in Q4. Then Q4 − F contains
(4 − f )-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting from any vertex if f ≤ 2.
Proof Let s be any vertex of Q4 in Vi(Q4) for any i ∈ {0,1}. If f = 0, then Theo-
rem 1 has ensured that Q4 has 4-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting
from s. Thus, we consider f ∈ {1,2} only. Because the hypercube is edge-transitive,
we assume that F contains a 4-dimensional edge. Then Q4 can be partitioned along
the fourth dimension into Q4,04 and Q
4,1
4 . For the sake of convenience, we define
some notations first: F0 = F ∩E(Q4,04 ), F1 = F ∩E(Q4,14 ), Fc = F ∩ E4c , f0 = |F0|,
f1 = |F1|, fc = |Fc|, and δ = 4 − f . Since fc ≥ 1, we have f0 ≤ 1 and f1 ≤ 1.
Case 1: f = 2. Thus, δ = 2. Without loss of generality, we assume that s is in
Q
4,0
4 .
Subcase 1.1: (s, (s)4) is fault-free. Since Q4 has eight 4-dimensional edges, we
can find two vertex-disjoint edges (u, (u)4) and (v, (v)4), both of which are fault-free
such that u ∈ V1−i (Q4,04 ) and v ∈ Vi(Q4,14 ). By Lemma 1, Q3 is 1-edge-fault-tolerant
Hamiltonian laceable. Hence, there exist two Hamiltonian paths H and T of Q4,04 −
F0 joining pairs s,u and (v)4, s, respectively. Similarly, there exist two Hamiltonian
paths P and R of Q4,14 −F1 joining pairs (u)4, (s)4 and (s)4,v, respectively. Let C1 =
〈s,H,u, (u)4,P , (s)4, s〉 and C2 = 〈s, (s)4,R,v, (v)4, T , s〉. Then C1 and C2 are 2-
mutually independent fault-free Hamiltonian cycles starting from s. See Fig. 1(a).
Subcase 1.2: (s, (s)4) is faulty.
Condition 1.2.1: f0 = f1 = 0. Let x ∈ Vi(Q4,04 ) − {s} such that (x, (x)4) is fault-
free, and let b be a neighbor of s in Q4,04 such that edges (s,b) and (b, (b)
4) are
fault-free. By Lemma 2, Q3 is hyper-Hamiltonian laceable. Thus, there exists a
Hamiltonian path P of Q4,04 − {b} joining x and s. By Lemma 1, there exists a
Hamiltonian path R of Q4,14 joining (b)4 and (x)4. For clarity, P and R are rep-
resented by 〈x,P ′,v, s〉 and 〈(b)4,R′,y, (x)4〉, respectively, where v (respectively,
y) is a neighbor of s (respectively, (x)4). Because Q4,14 is 1-edge-fault-tolerant
Hamiltonian laceable, there exists a Hamiltonian path H of Q4,14 − {((x)4,y)} join-
ing (x)4 and (b)4. Then we set C1 = 〈s,b, (b)4,R′,y, (x)4,x,P ′,v, s〉 and C2 =
〈s,v, rev(P ′),x, (x)4,H, (b)4,b, s〉, where rev(P ′) is the reverse of P ′. As a result,
C1 and C2 are 2-mutually independent fault-free Hamiltonian cycles starting from s.
See Fig. 1(b).

Case 2: f = 1. Because the hypercube is edge-transitive, we assume that F =
{(0000,1000)}. With symmetry, we consider s ∈ {0000,0100,0110,0111} only. Ta-
ble 3 shows that there are 3-mutually independent fault-free Hamiltonian cycles start-
ing from s, in which all binary strings are decimalized for the purpose of saving space.

Theorem 2 Let n ≥ 4. Suppose that F denotes any set of f edges in Qn. Then
Qn − F contains (n − f )-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting from
any vertex if f ≤ n − 2.
Proof Let s be any vertex of Qn. If f = 0, then Theorem 1 has ensured that Qn has n-
mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting from s. Thus, we consider 1 ≤ f ≤
n − 2 below. Without loss of generality, we assume that F contains a d-dimensional
edge for 1 ≤ d ≤ n. Then, Qn can be partitioned along the d th dimension into Qd,0n
and Qd,1n . Furthermore, we assume that s ∈ V0(Qd,0n ). For the sake of convenience,
we define some notations in advance: F0 = F ∩ E(Qd,0n ), F1 = F ∩ E(Qd,1n ), Fc =
F ∩ Ec, f0 = |F0|, f1 = |F1|, fc = |Fc|, and δ = n − f . Since fc ≥ 1, we have
f0 ≤ f − 1 and f1 ≤ f − 1.

Fig. 3 Illustration for
Subcase 1.2 of Theorem 2
tolerant Hamiltonian laceable. Since f1 = f −1 ≤ n−4, Qd,1n −{x,y} has a fault-free
Hamiltonian path R joining (vδ)d and z. By Lemma 3, Qd,0n − {s,vδ} has a Hamilto-
nian path T joining (x)d to bδ . Let Cδ = 〈s,vδ, (vδ)d ,R, z,y,x, (x)d , T ,bδ, s〉. Then
{C1,C2, . . . ,Cδ} is a set of δ-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting from
s in Qn − F . See Fig. 3(b).
Case 2: (s, (s)d) is fault-free.
Subcase 2.1: Suppose that f0 + fx ≤ f − 1 and f1 ≤ f − 2. Thus, we
have δ0 ≥ δ and δ1 ≥ δ. By Lemma 6, Qd,1n − F1 has δ-mutually fully inde-
pendent Hamiltonian paths Pi , 1 ≤ i ≤ δ, joining (wi )d and (bi )d . Let Ci =
〈s,vi ,Hi,wi , (wi )d ,Pi, (bi )d ,bi , s〉 for each i ∈ {1,2, . . . , δ}. Then {C1,C2, . . . ,Cδ}
is a set of δ-mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles starting from s in Qn − F .
Subcase 2.2: Suppose that f0 + fx = f or f1 = f − 1. Thus, we have δ0 = δ − 1
or δ1 = δ − 1. It follows from Lemma 6 that Qd,1n − F1 has (δ − 1)-mutually fully
independent Hamiltonian paths Pi , 1 ≤ i ≤ δ − 1, joining (wi )d and (bi )d .
Condition 2.2.1: f ≤ n − 3. Let Ci = 〈s,vi ,Hi,wi , (wi )d ,Pi, (bi )d ,bi , s〉 for
1 ≤ i ≤ δ−1. Obviously, we can choose two vertices x and x′ in V0(Qd,1n )−{(bδ)d}−
{Pi(2) | 1 ≤ i ≤ δ−1} such that (x, (x)d) /∈ F and (x′, (x′)d) /∈ F . Since |{(wi )d | 1 ≤
i ≤ δ − 1} ∪ {(s)d}| + f1 ≤ (n− f )+ (f − 1) = n− 1 < n < |NQd,1n (x)∪NQd,1n (x′)|,

Appendix A: Proof of Lemma 4
Proof The proof proceeds by induction on n. Our computer program verifies that
Q4 − {x,y} is 1-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian laceable. Please refer to the data
reported by Kung (2012). For n ≥ 5, we assume that (x,y) is r-dimensional with
1 ≤ r ≤ n. Let F ⊂ E(Qn −{x,y}) with 1 ≤ |F | ≤ n− 3. If there exists a d-partition
of Qn, d ∈ {1,2, . . . , n} − {r}, such that at least one faulty edge is d-dimensional,
then Qn is partitioned along the d th dimension; otherwise, every faulty edge is r-
dimensional, and Qn is partitioned into Qd,0n and Qd,1n with any d ∈ {1,2, . . . , n} −
{r}. Without loss of generality, we assume that (x,y) is in Qd,0n . Then, the inductive
hypothesis is that Qd,0n − {x,y} is (n − 4)-edge-fault-tolerant Hamiltonian laceable
for n ≥ 5.
Let Fi = F ∩ E(Qd,in ) for i ∈ {0,1}. The following two cases show that Qn −
{x,y} − F is Hamiltonian laceable.
Case 1: |F0| ≤ n − 4. Let s ∈ Vi(Qn) and t ∈ V1−i (Qn) for any i ∈ {0,1}.
Suppose that both s and t are in Qd,0n . By the inductive hypothesis, Qd,0n −{x,y}−
F0 is Hamiltonian laceable. Hence, there exists a Hamiltonian path P in Qd,0n −
{x,y}−F0 joining s and t. Clearly, there are  (P )2  vertex-disjoint edges on P . Since
 (P )2  =  2
n−1−3
2  = 2n−2 − 1 > n − 3 ≥ |F | for n ≥ 5, there exists an edge (u,v)
on P such that {(u, (u)d), (v, (v)d)} ∩ F = ∅. Accordingly, P can be represented
as 〈s,P1,u,v,P2, t〉. By Lemma 1, there exists a Hamiltonian path R in Qd,1n − F1
joining (u)d and (v)d . Then 〈s,P1,u, (u)d ,R, (v)d ,v,P2, t〉 is a Hamiltonian path of
Qn − {x,y} − F . See Fig. 6(a).
Suppose that both s and t are in Qd,1n . Obviously, it follows from Lemma 1 that
there exists a Hamiltonian path R in Qd,1n − F1 joining s and t. Since  (R)2  =
 2n−1−12  = 2n−2 > n − 1 ≥ |{x,y}| + |F | for n ≥ 5, there exists an edge (u,v)
on R such that {(v)d , (u)d} ∩ {x,y} = ∅ and {(u, (u)d), (v, (v)d)} ∩ F = ∅. There-
fore, R can be represented as 〈s,R1,u,v,R2, t〉. By the inductive hypothesis, there
exists a Hamiltonian path P in Qd,0n − {x,y} − F0 joining (u)d and (v)d . Then
〈s,R1,u, (u)d ,P, (v)d ,v,R2, t〉 is a Hamiltonian path of Qn − {x,y} − F . See
Fig. 6(b) for illustration.
Suppose that s is in Qd,0n and t is in Qd,1n . Let b ∈ V1−i (Qd,0n ) − {x,y} such that
(b, (b)d) /∈ F . It follows from the inductive hypothesis that there exists a Hamiltonian
path P in Qd,0n − {x,y} − F0 joining s and b. By Lemma 1, there exists a Hamilto-
nian path R in Qd,1n − F1 joining (b)d and t. As a result, 〈s,P ,b, (b)d ,R, t〉 is a
Hamiltonian path in Qn − {x,y} − F . See Fig. 6(c) for illustration.
Case 2: |F0| = n − 3. This case implies that every faulty edge is r-dimensional.
Similarly, let s ∈ Vi(Qn) and t ∈ V1−i (Qn) for any i ∈ {0,1}.
Subcase 2.1: Both s and t are in Qd,0n . Let (u,v) ∈ F and F ′ = F −{(u,v)}. By the
inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path P in Qd,0n −{x,y}−F ′ joining
s and t. If (u,v) ∈ E(P ), then path P can be represented as 〈s,P1,u,v,P2, t〉; other-
wise, P is written as 〈s, T1,p,q, T2, t〉, where (p,q) is any edge of P . Clearly, Qd,1n
has Hamiltonian paths R and H joining pairs (u)d , (v)d and (p)d , (q)d , respectively.
Then either 〈s,P1,u, (u)d ,R, (v)d ,v,P2, t〉 or 〈s, T1,p, (p)d ,H, (q)d ,q, T2, t〉 is a
Hamiltonian path of Qn − {x,y} − F . See Fig. 7(a) for illustration.

or 〈s,R1, (v)d , (u)d ,R2, t〉. As a result, either 〈s,R1, (u)d ,u,P ,v, (v)d ,R2, t〉 or
〈s,R1, (v)d ,v,P ,u, (u)d ,R2, t〉 is a Hamiltonian path of Qn − {x,y} − F . See
Fig. 7(d) for illustration.
Subcase 2.3: s is in Qd,0n and t is in Qd,1n . Because every faulty edge is r-
dimensional, we can find a faulty edge (u,v) such that t /∈ {(u)d , (v)d}. Let b ∈
V1−i (Qd,0n ) − {x,y} such that b is not incident to any faulty edge. We denote
F −{(u,v)} by F ′. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path P in
Q
d,0
n − {x,y} − F ′ joining s and b.
Condition 2.3.1: (u,v) /∈ E(P ). Then, Lemma 1 ensures that there exists a Hamil-
tonian path R in Qd,1n joining (b)d and t. Thus, 〈s,P ,b, (b)d ,R, t〉 is a Hamiltonian
path of Qn − {x,y} − F . See Fig. 7(e).
Condition 2.3.2: (u,v) ∈ E(P ). Then, path P can be represented as 〈s,P1,u,v,
P2,b〉. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a Hamiltonian path H in Qd,1n −
{(u)d , (v)d} joining (b)d and t. Therefore, 〈s,P1,u, (u)d , (v)d ,v,P2,b, (b)d ,H, t〉
is a Hamiltonian path of Qn − {x,y} − F . See Fig 7(f). 
Appendix B: Proof of Lemma 6
Proof The proof proceeds by induction on n. Suppose that f = 0. Then this case fol-
lows from Lemma 5. Suppose that f = n−2. Then we have δ = n − 1 − (n − 2) = 1.
By Lemma 1, Qn − F has a Hamiltonian path joining any two vertices in different
partite sets. Moreover, this theorem is trivial for Q3, as the induction basis. In what
follows, we consider 1 ≤ f ≤ n − 3 and n ≥ 4. The inductive hypothesis is that the
theorem statement is true for Qn−1.
Since δ + f = n − 1 < n, there must exist an integer d in {1,2, . . . , n} such that
A ∪ F contains no d-dimensional edges. Since Qn is edge-transitive, we can assume
d = n. Then we partition Qn into {Qn,0n ,Qn,1n } along the nth dimension. Thus, each
edge of A∪F is in either Qn,0n or Qn,1n . For the sake of convenience, we define some
notations to be used later: F0 = F ∩ E(Qn,0n ), F1 = F ∩ E(Qn,1n ), Fc = F ∩ Enc ,
f0 = |F0|, f1 = |F1|, and δ = n − 1 − f .
Let r0 = |{(wi ,bi ) ∈ E(Qn,0n ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ δ}| and r1 = |{(wi ,bi ) ∈ E(Qn,1n ) | 1 ≤
i ≤ δ}|. Clearly, r0 + r1 = δ. Without loss of generality, we assume {(w1,b1), . . . ,
(wr0,br0)} ⊂ E(Qn,0n ) if r1 = 0, and {(wr0+1,br0+1), . . . , (wδ,bδ)} ⊂ E(Qn,1n ) if
r1 > 0. Since n − 1 = δ + f = r0 + r1 + f0 + f1, we have ri + fj ≤ n − 1 for
any i, j ∈ {0,1}. Then we have to take the following cases into account.
Case 1: Suppose that ri + fj ≤ n − 2 for any i, j ∈ {0,1}. Since r0 + f0 ≤ n − 2,
r0 ≤ n − 2 − f0 = (n − 1) − 1 − f0. By the inductive hypothesis, Qn,0n − F0 has
r0-mutually fully independent Hamiltonian paths Hi[wi ,bi], 1 ≤ i ≤ r0, if r0 > 0.
Obviously, Hi[wi ,bi] can be represented as 〈wi ,H ′i ,ui ,bi〉, where ui is some vertex
adjacent to bi . Similarly, Qn,1n − F1 has r1-mutually fully independent Hamiltonian
paths Hi[wi ,bi] = 〈wi ,H ′i ,ui ,bi〉, r0 + 1 ≤ i ≤ δ, if r1 > 0.
For r0 > 0, we construct r0 paths in Qn,1n − F1 to incorporate the previ-
ously established r0 paths of Qn,0n − F0. Since r0 + f1 ≤ n − 2, we have r0 ≤
n − 2 − f1. By the inductive hypothesis, Qn,1n − F1 also contains r0-mutually

Lemma 6
By the inductive hypothesis, Qn,1n − {((b2)n, ((b1)j )n)} has a Hamiltonian path
R2[(u2)n, (b2)n]. Obviously, we have R2(2n−1 − 1) = ((b1)j )n. Again, we set
P1[w1,b1] = 〈w1, (w1)n,R1, (u1)n,u1,H ′1, (b1)j , ((b1)j )n, (b1)n,b1〉 and
P2[w2,b2] = 〈w2,H ′2,u2, (u2)n,R2, (b2)n,b2〉. Hence, P1 and P2 are fully inde-
pendent Hamiltonian paths in Qn − F . Also see Fig. 9(b).
Case 3: Suppose that ri + f1−i = n − 1 for some i ∈ {0,1}. Without loss of
generality, we assume r1 + f0 = n − 1. Since r1 = n − 1 − f0 ≥ n − 1 − f = δ,
we have r1 = δ and F0 = F . By the inductive hypothesis, Qn,1n has (r1 − 1)-
mutually fully independent Hamiltonian paths Hi[wi ,bi] = 〈wi ,H ′i ,ui ,bi〉, where
ui is some vertex adjacent to bi for 1 ≤ i ≤ r1 − 1. Since r1 − 1 = δ − 1 =
n − 2 − f = (n − 1) − 1 − f0, Qn,0n − F0 has (r1 − 1)-mutually fully indepen-
dent Hamiltonian paths Ri[(ui )n, (bi )n], 1 ≤ i ≤ r1 − 1. Then we set Pi[wi ,bi] =
〈wi ,H ′i ,ui , (ui )n,Ri, (bi )n,bi〉 for 1 ≤ i ≤ r1 − 1. Next, we choose a vertex v of
V0(Q
n,0
n ) and construct a Hamiltonian path Rr1[(wr1)n,v] in Qn,0n − F0 such that
v = Ri(2) and Rr1(2n−1 − 1) = (ui )n for every 1 ≤ i ≤ r1 − 1. How can we do that?
We distinguish the following subcases.
Subcase 3.1: Suppose that n = 5 or f > 1. Obviously, vertices (u1)n, . . . , (ur1−1)n
have at most (r1 −1)(n−1) neighboring vertices in Qn,0n . Since |V0(Qn,0n )| = 2n−2 >
(r1 −1)(n−1) = (n−2−f )(n−1), we can choose a vertex v other than neighbors of
(u1)n, . . . , (ur1−1)n. Obviously, we have v = Ri(2) for 1 ≤ i ≤ r1 − 1. By Lemma 1,
there exists a Hamiltonian path Rr1[(wr1)n,v] in Qn,0n −F0. Because v is not adjacent
to any vertex of {(u1)n, . . . , (ur1−1)n}, we have Rr1(2n−1 − 1) = (ui )n for every
1 ≤ i ≤ r1 − 1. By Lemma 2, there exists a Hamiltonian path Hr1[(v)n,br1] in
Q
n,1
n − {wr1}. Then we set Pr1 = 〈wr1, (wr1)n,Rr1,v, (v)n,Hr1 ,br1〉. Consequently,

Director of the Center for 
Education and Research in 
Information Assurance and 
Security (CERIAS) and as Interim 
Director of Cyber Center

Prof. Vincenzo Loia, University of Salerno, Italy:      
Vincenzo Loia is Full Professor of Computer 
Science. His research interests include Intelligent 
Agents, Ambient intelligence, Hybrid intelligent 
systems, Collective Knowledge. He is Chair of 
the Task Force “Intelligent Agents”, and of the 
Task Force "Ambient Intelligence" both from 
IEEE CIS ETTC, and Vice-Chair of IEEE CIS 
Intelligent Systems Application Technical 
Committee.  
Abstract In the talk we first discuss 
motivations why taking into 
account location information in 
authentication and access control is 
important. We then survey current 
approaches to location-aware 
authentication with focus on the 
Auth-SL system that supports 
context-based flexible 
authentication policies. We then 
discuss location-aware access 
control and present the 
GEO-RBAC system and the 
FENCE system that use location 
for different purposes. Throughout 
the discussion, we will identify 
open research directions. 
The wealth of European companies has 
progressively shifted from tangible assets (capital, 
resources) into intangible ones like knowledge, 
competency, reputation, innovation processes, 
motivation. Intangibles are closely related the 
natural interactions occurring normally in work 
practices. This is where ideas, innovation, 
learning, knowledge (in all its various forms), 
relationships, social cohesion, synergistically 
contribute to performance, competition 
differentiators and value creation. Creativity and 
innovation inside organisations are directly 
related to the way people learn (informally and/or 
formally), collaborate, share ideas and 
experience. The support of these activities within 
the Enterprise it is provided by several tools and 
environments. This doesn't help to capture and 
elicitate the possible intangible assets. Even in the 
case where some pieces of knowledge could be

Performance Analysis of Reliable Transmission on Multiple Paths and Single Path 
Using multiple paths for achieving high capability has some obvious benefits. However, some multipath 
protocols may not get acceptable throughput if reliable transmission is guaranteed. For some case, the 
situation may even worse than using single path only. The authors propose a specific mechanism to 
analyze the potential problems which may lead to performance decrease in reliable multipath 
transmission. Topologies for multiple paths and single path are set up for evaluating the analytical 
methods. The results reveal some critical conditions and could be helpful in designing scheduling 
schemes for multipath transmission. 
 
Random Graph Languages for Distorted and Ambiguous Patterns: Single Layer Model 
This paper introduces a linguistic based model designed for distorted or ambiguous patterns where a 
graph based approach is used for structure representation. The knowledge about unevenness is usually 
created on the basis of finite number of patterns treated as positive samples of unknown language. The 
IE graphs are used as the base. Single pattern can be represented using deterministic IE graph. 
Subsequently, the collection of patterns, represented by deterministic graph is transformed into 
equivalent random graph language. Utilization of the grammatical inference mechanisms gives the 
possibility to perform this process in automatic way. Using the IE graphs and imposing some simple 
limitations on graph structures allows to obtain a polynomial complexity of knowledge inference. In the 
work it is described how to use the proposed model for collecting the knowledge in handwritten 
signatures recognition and analysis systems. Information about graphemes (solid fragment of 
handwritten signature) variability is stored in the form of random IE graphs and stochastic ETPL(k) 
graph grammars. Instead of an ordinary the IE graph, an attributed one is used in order to increase a 
descriptive power of the proposed schema. The parametrical data embedded in the graph carries some 
additional semantic information associated with the structure of pattern. The work presents discussion 
about inference scheme and computational complexity of the proposed linguistic representation scheme. 
Described methodology can be especially suited for creating the knowledge representation of the 
handwritten signatures, signs and ideograms (e.g. kanji) in offline recognition systems. 
 
Balancing Resource Utilization for Continuous Virtual Machine Requests in Clouds 
The placement of virtual machines (VMs) on a cluster of physical machines (PMs) is a primary task in 
clouds. The authors can benefit a lot from appropriate placement policy, e.g. cost saving. In this paper, 
The authors raise a continuous virtual machine placement problem and propose an on-line algorithm to 
reduce the power consumption of clouds. Generic methods which deal with this problem with greedy 
manner will result in resource leak, a phenomenon of resource wasting. The direct consequence of this 
phenomenon is larger number of running PMs, which will cause higher power consumption. The 
authors prove it is an NP-complete problem to minimize the power consumption during the placement 
of VMs while the VM requests reach the clouds continuously. The authors propose a balanced algorithm 
with the principle of avoiding 
resource leak. The balanced algorithm handles the VM requests in real time and guarantees high 
resource utilization. The number of PMs and power consumption can be cut down as a result of high
