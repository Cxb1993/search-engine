TEC manufacturers. The search and analysis is based on the 
user input design specifications. 
II. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
A. Principles of Thermoelectric Cooling Devices 
Generally, the function of the synonymous types of 
standard TECs made by different manufacturers is the same, 
the geometry, specifications and characteristics may not be 
similar due to variations in design and manufacture. The 
designer has to select suitable TECs from among these 
manufacturers to meet the design requirements. Searching 
for a suitable TEC to optimize a design can be a tedious task 
as there are many global TEC manufacturers, each of whom 
has a large collection of products ranging from low cost 
commercial to high performance TECs. As various operating 
conditions and geometry constraints are possible in the 
design of thermoelectric cooling systems, designers often 
have to search separately through the products from several 
manufacturers. This can be a cumbersome process. To 
facilitate the design task further, it is desirable to have a 
uniform electronic search and analysis facility with 
integrated functionalities and accessibility to the various 
manufacturers’ product data on their TECs [2]. 
When the TEC is used as a cooler, conventionally 
followed the basic arrangement shown in Fig. 2, it absorbs 
heat from the surface or object to be cooled and transfers the 
energy by conduction to the finned or liquid heat exchanger, 
which ultimately dissipates the waste heat to the surrounding 
ambient air by means of convection. The TEC operates by 
the Peltier effect, which induces a temperature difference 
when an electrical current flows through a junction of 
dissimilar materials. If a thermoelectric module is supplied 
with a direct current I (A), a certain amount of heat Qc (W) 
is absorbed in the cold side and pumped to the hot side. 
Because of the Peltier effect the heat pumped is proportional 
to the value of the current and the temperature at the cold 
side Tc (K), being α (V/K) the Peltier coefficient. However, 
in a real thermoelectric module, the heat absorbed in the cold 
side is not just the Peltier term, because it is diminished by 
the power due to electrical resistance and heat transfer due to 
thermal conductivity. 
Assuming that internal material properties (α and λ) 
are constants that do not depend on the temperature, based 
upon the formulation of Palacios et al. [8], the equation for 
the heat power taken at the cold sink is: 
E
TEI
2
1ITQ 2cc
Δλ
−ρ−α=                          (1) 
where α is the Seebeck coefficient (V/K) and E (m/m2) is a 
geometric property of the pellets defined as height divided 
by the cross section. Defining )K/W(E/λ=γ (thermal 
conductance) and )(E Ωρ=β  (electrical resistance) the 
following equation for a given value of E is obtained: 
TI
2
1ITQ 2cc Δγ−β−α=                            (2) 
Similar equations can be used for the heat power given at 
the hot sink, where only the sign of the middle term is 
changed from negative to positive: 
E
TEI

1ITQ 2hh
Δλ

TI
2
1ITQ 2hh Δγ−β+α=                            (4) 
The electrical power supplied to the system is simply the 
product of the current and voltage. 
IVW ⋅=                                               (5) 
Hence the power balance equation will be given by Eqs. 
(2), (4), and (5). 
2ITIW βα +Δ=⋅==− IVQQ ch                        (6) 
ITV β+Δα=                                        (7) 
The measurement of the physical properties of a 
thermoelectric module can be found in Huang [10]. The 
Seebeck coefficient α  can be measured from a pure 
conduction test, i.e. letting I=0. Measuring the hot-end and 
the cold-end temperatures, Th and Tc, and the induced 
thermoelectric voltage V, we can determine from Eq. (7) 
with I=0. Measuring Qc, at I=0, we can determine the 
thermal conductivity γ from the heat conduction equation, 
i.e. Eq. (2) with I=0. Using the testing data of V at various I, 
Tc, Th, and the measured α , we can determine the total 
resistance β from Eq. (7). The important advantage of Eq. 
(7) is that it contains just two parameters that can be easily 
estimated from the performance curves provided by the 
manufacturer. After obtaining α and β, the other properties 
γ , λ  and ρ  can be derived directly. For easy 
implementation, a computer program was written to 
automatically read the test data and analyze the physical 
properties. 
B. Modeling of Thermoelectric Cooling Systems 
Thermoelectric cooling systems are analogous to 
conventional refrigeration systems. A conventional cooling 
system includes an evaporator, a compressor, and a 
condenser. A thermoelectric cooling system has similar 
subassemblies. In applications, an electronic device to be 
cooled is usually directly physically mounted on the cold 
side of one or more thermoelectric devices allowing 
maximum thermal transfer between the electronic device and 
the cold side. The hot side of the thermoelectric device is 
coupled to a heat sink and a fan or water is used to cool the 
hot heat sink. Nature convection is also used in some cases. 
A variable source of direct current connected to the 
thermoelectric coolers to allow them to lower the 
temperature of the electronic devices. The usefulness of 
thermoelectric materials for refrigeration is often 
characterized by the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of 
merit ZT [1,7]. The value of Z is given by 
βγ
α 2
=Z                                      (8) 
The coefficient of performance (COP) used to define the 
cooling “efficiency” is defined as the net heat absorbed at the 
cold end divided by the applied electric power. If the heat 
pumping capacity Qc of a thermoelectric cooling module is 
given by eqn. (2) and the amount of W dissipated by a 
thermoelectric cooling module to perform the electronic

V2-8
Following the numerical modeling procedures shown in 
Fig. 4, the values of α, β and γ can be obtained for the 
thermoelectric module Ferrotec 9500/127/085B, used as an 
example are shown in Table 1. Comparing the estimated 
values by method III [8] to results by methods I and II [9] 
(utilized Imax, Vmax, Qmax and ΔTmax from manufacturer), the 
worst case for estimating these parameters  is 16.88% in 
relative error. According to Palacios’ comments,  the main 
reason for a better accuracy of method III is the use of 
several data point read from the datasheet graphs instead of 
using just the values corresponding to the most extreme 
condition. 
Once the values of α, β and γ are obtained, it is 
possible to analytically simulate the behavior of the module 
at any working condition by using the basic equations (2)-(7). 
Using Eq. (2) for Th = 323 K and ΔT = 0 K, 10 K, 20 K, 30 
K, 40 K, 50 K, and 60 K, respectively, seven of the 
characteristic curves for constant temperature differences are 
obtained. Fig. 5 includes dot symbols representing the values 
simulated using Eq. (2), over the experimental curves from 
the manufacturer datasheet. This graph shows some 
interesting results for these three estimating procedures. For 
each temperature difference condition, the simulated 
pumping powers are in the sequence of method III < method 
II < method I. Hence, good precision of the simulated data 
are obtained by averaging the results of these three methods 
and therefore confirms the accuracy of the proposed 
parameter estimation procedure.  
B. Design Optimizations 
In practical applications, it is crucial to design a 
thermoelectric cooling system including the designs of the 
heat spreader and heat sink together with the interface 
materials in optimum operating conditions. In this study, the 
design consideration of Gotken [13] is adopted to investigate 
the design optimizations of a thermoelectric assembly. 
Figure 6 shows the results of device parameter X, device 
efficiency ψ, and maximum power Pmax subjected to varied 
S. In this case, Ψ and τ are evaluated to be 0.8542 and 
0.9161 respectively. Factor R is changed according to the 
setting of  0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. For smaller value 
of factor R, the device parameter X varied apparently just in 
the range of 0<S<2. Beyond this range, it remains constantly. 
On the contrary, for larger value of factor R, X varied 
monotonically to a saturated value which is lower than the 
case of R=0.1. It is interesting to note that there are three 
different regions of efficiency curves as S is varied, that is, a 
rapid increment region, a plateau region, and a sudden drop 
region where efficiency will be decay to zero dramatically, 
respectively. The sudden change of efficiency is happed just 
in the point of S equal to Ψ. This phenomenon is worthy to 
conduct more research further. In regions of rapid increment 
and plateau, device efficiency of a thermoelectric assembly 
is influence by the factor R, and efficiency is large if factor R 
is small. Maximum power of the thermoelectric assembly is 
changed exactly like device parameter X since, according to 
eq. (19), it is twice the values of X. Based on aforementioned 
results, this design approach is simple and effective to the 
design optimization of a thermoelectric cooling system. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this study, for design considerations, it is crucial to 
establish an effective methodology to determine and 
optimize the TEC performance within the cooling system 
constraints. For this purpose, firstly, three approaches, 
extracting thermoelectric internal parameters from the 
information provided by performance curves analytically [8] 
and estimating parameters from the information available in 
the vendor datasheet [9], respectively, are studied and 
confirmed the accuracy of the proposed parameter estimation 
procedure. For these three estimating procedures, the 
simulated pumping powers are in the sequence of method III 
< method II < method I for each temperature difference. 
Hence, good precision of the simulated data are obtained by 
averaging the results of these three methods. Then, design 
optimizations of a thermoelectric assembly are conducted to 
obtain results of device parameter X, device efficiency ψ, 
and maximum power Pmax subjected to varied S, respectively. 
There are three different regions of efficiency curves as S is 
varied, that is, a rapid increment region, a plateau region, and 
a sudden drop region where efficiency will be decay to zero 
dramatically, respectively. The sudden change of efficiency 
is happed just in the point of S equal to Ψ. This phenomenon 
is worthy to conduct more research further. Maximum power 
is changed exactly like device parameter X since it is twice 
the values of X. Investigation results show it is simple and 
effective way for design of a thermoelectric cooling system.

本研究計畫主要是探討液冷封裝高功率 LED 照明之自然對流熱傳現象。其結論歸納為以下
幾點： 
1、由數值分析熱流場得知，增加輸入功率會造成自然對流的提升，並增加內部流體之對
流效應。 
2、數值分析中不同擺置角度對自然對流熱傳所造成晶片接點溫度之影響，其中 =90°可以
降低晶片接點溫度為 1.22%~3.14%； =180°則降低晶片接點溫度為 0.17%~1.19%。 
3、數值分析中當改變液冷封裝 LED 內部流體之結果， =0°與 =180°時流體為矽油相較於
空氣降低熱阻為 1.15%~2.31%，然而在 =90°時則以 FC-40 為流體相較於空氣可降低熱阻
2.07%~2.86%。 
4、液冷封裝高功率 LED 照度的實驗量測結果，增加輸入功率會使內部產生高溫而導致照
度的降低，其三種流體照度值由高至低分別為 6W＞3W＞9W。
