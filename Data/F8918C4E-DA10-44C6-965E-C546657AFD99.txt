gyroscopes, vibration gyroscopes, and rotary 
gyroscopes have been made so far. Among all of 
them, researchers are greatly interested in the 
vibration gyroscopes due to the advantages of 
simple structure and easy fabrication. Much 
attention has been paid on ring-type resonant 
microgyroscopes, because the geometric center of 
them remains unchanged during deformation so 
that the error due to the rigid-body motion is 
removed.  
In order to avoid the loss of signal from 
mechanical element (that is, the vibrating ring) to 
the pick-off electric-circuit element due to the 
distance transmission, it is a trade off to combine 
the ring and the electric circuit into a single 
silicon chip, and usually the single-crystal silicon 
wafer is chosen to be (100) orientation rather (111) 
one, because the etching process of Si(100) is 
more easy than Si(111) and is commonly used in 
semiconductor industry. Based on this reason, we 
design the micro-ring gyroscopes made from 
Si(100) wafers. However, Si(100) is anisotropic 
in material property, which must be accounted for 
in the evaluation of natural frequencies of the ring. 
Hwang et al. [1] investigated the effect of 
in-plane profile variations of a ring on the 
frequency splitting. Eley et al. [2] studied the 
directional variations of elastic moduli for 
single-crystal silicon in the (100) plane, and the 
additional variations in the elastic moduli for the 
planes misaligned from the (111) and (100) planes. 
His results reveals that pairs of natural 
frequencies of the ring split for modes with 2, 4, 
6 … nodal diameters, but not for modes with 3, 5, 
7…nodal diameters. However, Eley directly 
borrowed the strain-energy expression of 
anisotropic materials from isotropic ones [3] and 
simply replaced the constant Young’s modulus by 
the one which is function of the circumferential 
variable of the ring. In so doing, they viewed each 
differential element of the ring as an isotropic 
strip, which is incorrect in theory but an expedient 
for simplifying analysis. Wortman [4], Nye [5], 
and so on have pointed out that the Young’s 
modulus of the silicon material varies with 
different planes and orientations. 
Our work is separated into two parts in this 
paper. The first part is theoretic analysis and the 
second is experiment. First the expression for the 
strain energy of the ring in the theoretically- 
correct form rather than the approximate given in 
Eley’s paper [2] is derived. What we have to do is 
to derive the stiffness matrix, which relates stress 
to strain, and of which the coefficients are 
functions of coordinate variables. Hamiltonian’s 
principle is employed to derive the equations of 
motion, which is a set of partial differential 
equation with coefficients being functions of 
circumferential variable. The ring is assumed to 
deform into elliptical shape when vibration. We 
properly weight the equations of motion and 
integrate them along the circumferential variable 
to get a set of amplitude equations in terms of 
generalized coordinates. The explicit from of 
natural frequencies and mode shapes of the ring 
are found.  
When the ring is set to rotate, Coriolis force 
induces the secondary mode of vibration. This 
mode is called sensing mode. The working 
principle of the gyroscope is to excite the ring 
into vibration by electric force produced by the 
capacity across which a voltage with frequency at 
the primary natural frequency of the ring is 
applied. The amplitude of the sensing mode is a 
function of the input angular velocity of rotational 
body. We use the method of multiple-scale to find 
the analytical expression for the output (the 
nodal-point displacement of the ring) to the input 
(the angular speed of the ring). Since the 
amplitude of the applied voltage influences the 
natural frequencies of the ring, the method of 
phase-lock is used so as to keep the ring vibrating 
at resonant state.  
Gallacher [6] proposed that the modes with 
smaller n can excite the larger amplitude of the 
sinnθ mode. Therefore we will use the mode with 
n = 2 to excite and measure the amplitude of the 
mode in our current study. Harris et al. [7] 
proposed a silicon ring gyroscope with 
electromagnetic actuation and sensing in 1998 
and they pointed out the shift in resonant 
frequency of cos2θ and sin2θ modes. He and 
Najafi [8] employed the isotropic property of (111) 
oriented single-crystal silicon material to reduce 
the influence of the shift in resonant frequency on 
the performance of vibrating ring gyroscope. In 
second part of our work, a new design of 
vibrating ring will be introduced to ensure the 
resonance frequency of both cos2θ and sin2θ 
modes being the same in the experiment. Four 
kinds of suspensions are designed and put into 
experiment to find out the best one. All the 
recipes and methods for the MEMS processes in 
this experiment will be described, such as BOE

Silicon crystal is a double face-centered cubic 
structure. The (100) and (111) cross- sections are 
shown in Fig. 3. It is obviously that Si(100) is less 
dense than Si(111). The atomic packing is not 
isotropic.

shown in Fig. 4. Usually we excite the ring into 
vibration with mode given by (10a), which is 
called exciting mode, the mode given by (10b) is 
induced by the Coriolis force and is called 
sensing mode. Notice that the anti-node point of

the exciting mode.

process of silicon wafer, the part unprotected 
by thick film photoresist without being 
imprinted by Mask 3 will be etched through by 
ICP. It only needs the alignment step three times

Design of Fabrication Process 
Fabrication of glass base  
In order to fabricate the glass base, several 
steps are performed. The first step is to clean the 
glass base and then the glass wafer is plated with 
a photoresist layer. Next the thermal evaporator is 
used to plate 300Å-thickness Cr with plating rate 
0.5Å/min and then 3000Å-thickness Au with 
plating rate 2Å/min on the front side of glass 
wafer. At this time, the Au/Cr mask layer is 
completed. Then the wet etching process is 
performed. Finally, the glass base with grooves is 
obtained. The result of each step is shown in Fig. 
11-17.

isotropic so the side wall of the electrode appears 
the slope and it is not vertical. The aim of the 
reserved electrode zones is to support electrodes 
and a small amount of side etching is allowed. 
However, the flatness of glass surface after 
etching is significant otherwise the anodic 
bonding will not succeed.

The contour of the glass structure is measured by 
surface contour measuring instrument (α-STEP) 
and is shown in Fig. 25 and 26. The zones labeled 
with A to E in Fig. 25 correspond to those in Fig. 
24. Zone D is 5.7μm deep and is the reserved 
space for the vibration of the silicon ring and its 
suspension. From Fig. 26, we see that the original 
designed width 200μm of the electrode reserved 
zone is reduced to about 160μm due to the 
influence of side etching.

620Å. On the other hand, the average roughness 
of silicon wafer is Ra 78.9Å and its TIR is 310Å. 
The surface roughness of both glass base and 
silicon wafer is much smaller than 1μm so that it

Problem and Discussion of Experiment 
Manufacturing process of lift-off on glass 
wafer 
The lift-off is used to define the pattern of 
the metal mask in the experiment. Before the 
metal is plated on glass wafer, the 
photolithography process in which the pattern is 
imprinted by Mask 1 is performed. The adhesive 
force of photoresist S1813 on glass wafer is much 
smaller so the thinnest part of the pattern during 
the developing process is easily broken, especially. 
It is indicated in Fig. 39. To solve the problem is 
to increase the temperature of soft-bake from 
90℃ to 110℃ and then the adhesive force is 
enhanced by removing the solvent in photoresist. 
However, overtime soft-bake will cause the 
polymerization of photoresist and hence it will 
influence its light sensitivity. Therefore, the 
suitable time of soft-bake is one minute.

process  
 
Etching of glass base 
According to the etching rate table presented 
by K. R. Williamset et al.[9] in 2003, the dry 
etching of 7740 glass can also be performed by 
using reactive ion etching system (RIE) to fill in 
CF4 and O2.

Wet etching of silicon wafer  
The thickness of the required silicon wafer to 
make the gyro in the experiment is 150μm. The 
silicon wafer with such thickness is particular 
specification so it is not easy to obtain the product 
in the market. Hence, practically the silicon wafer 
with thickness 250μm and double-sided polishing 
is used instead and the required particular 
thickness is fulfilled through the procedure of wet 
etching. KOH is stable, poisonless, easy to be 
obtained and good in flatness of etching so it is 
adopted as the etchant of silicon wafer in the 
experiment. Basically the surface roughness can 
be improved by adding IPA to the KOH etchant 
during etching process. However, according to the 
paper presented by Zubel et al.[12], the required 
IPA to obtain the good etching surface is less and 
less when the concentration of KOH increases. 
Even when IPA is not added anymore after a 
certain concentration of KOH, the good etching 
surface can still be obtained.

CONCLUSION  
The first part of this paper presents the 
dynamical analysis of a single-crystal silicon 
micro-ring gyroscope. We are the first to analyze 
successfully the effects of the anisotropy in elastic 
constants of Si(100) and Si(111) single crystals on 
the frequency, frequency bifurcation, and mode 
shapes. The exact solutions for frequency and 
mode shapes are obtained by solving the partial 
different equations with variable coefficients in 
terms of the circumferential coordinate. The 
frequencies of a pair of in-plane vibrational 
modes of an isotropic ring such as Si(111) are the 
same, but split for the anisotropic ring such as 
Si(100) crystals. The drawback of the splitting 
frequencies is that the frequency of the sensing 
modes is different slightly from that of the driving 
mode. Our analytical results show that the 
amplitude of output signal of Si(100) is about one 
eighth of that of the isotropic Si(111). A method 
of reconciling this splitting frequency so as to 
enhancing the output signal is invented. A 
phase-lock driving technique is proposed to raise 
gyroscopic efficiency, that is, the ratio of output 
to input. The rigorous analysis will help designing 
the gyroscopes of high performance and high 
accuracy. The second part of this paper is the 
design and fabrication of micro-ring gyroscope. 
In the experiment, four kinds of suspensions are 
designed first and after examining their relative 
advantages and disadvantages, we conclude that 
the third and fourth kinds of them are suitable to 
be the gyroscope structure. The manufactured 
gyro in the experiment can be really actuated by 
the driving electrodes and the signal can be 
sensed by the sensing electrodes. Therefore, we 
conclude that the microgyro fulfilling the required 
functions is successfully made in our study. The 
paper “In-Plane Free Vibration of a Single- 
Crystal Silicon Ring” of our study results has 
been published on the journal of “International 
Journal of Solids and Structures” on August 19, 
2008. Besides, our conference paper “On the 
determination of etching (or growth) rates of 
single crystals,” has also been presented on 2008 
ASME International Mechanical Engineering 
Congress & Exposition on Oct 31-Nov 6, 2008.
