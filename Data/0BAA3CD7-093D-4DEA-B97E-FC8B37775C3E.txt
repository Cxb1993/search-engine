摘      要 
本研究主要分為三個部分，第一部份係探討奈米鐵分散劑對奈米粒子傳輸之影響；第
二部分係以單顆粒軌跡分析方法，分析奈米粒子在多孔介質傳輸之情況；第三部分則是現
地的奈米鐵處理受氯乙烯以及1,2-二氯乙烷污染場址的模廠試驗結果。關於第一部份研究，
係因奈米粒子之間的距離很小，顆粒間的吸引力使其極容易絮聚，而無法均勻分散於液相
中，因而限制實用性。為了解決這個問題，本研究先設定在製備最佳化的奈米零價鐵金屬
的穩定配方，實驗中以硫酸亞鐵及硼氫化鈉為原料，並加入對環境友善的非離子介面活性
劑，作為穩定分散劑，同時以連續迴流方式製備奈米鐵懸浮液。經由測試發現，加入此非
離子介面活性劑，可以增加奈米零價鐵顆粒或是地下水層砂質顆粒之電雙層厚度，降低顆
粒碰撞成功所造成之絮聚現象，有助於奈米零價鐵顆粒在多孔介質中的傳輸效率。藉由過
濾理論的初步推導，也證明黏滯係數確實偏低，更加說明所選擇的非離子介面活性劑，對
奈米零價鐵金屬顆粒在多孔介質環境中傳輸有相當助益。關於第二部份研究，研究加入不
同之穩定分散劑以批次式製備奈米級懸浮液，並探討其穩定分散之能力。以聚丙烯酸 (PAA) 
為分散劑所得之奈米鐵懸浮液可於28 天後仍持續90%以上之懸浮效果。鐵顆粒之平均粒徑
約為87 nm。SEM-EDS 觀察顯示奈米鐵顆粒似包裹於含氧量較高之穩定分散劑中 ，基本
之粒徑約為200 nm 左右。以奈米鐵懸浮液注入10 cm、20 cm 及30 cm 之土柱實驗中，其
濃度之穿透率分別為75.6 %、61 %及41 %，經計算得知奈米鐵顆粒隨距離被滯留之衰減係
數κ為0.01cm-1。最後以顆粒之表面性質分析及土柱穿透試驗之結果撰寫奈米鐵顆粒於土壤
中傳輸之模式。模式之內容為以楔型管模擬土壤顆粒之孔洞，在楔型管內對粒子進行跡軌
分析以探討其於土壤表面之吸附情況，使得顆粒穿透土柱之情況在電腦之計算中重現。比
較鐵顆粒穿透10 cm土壤時穿透率之模擬值與實驗值可發現，模式有高估之現象。假設此誤
差為被過濾粒子之粒徑於楔型管內改變而導致，調整粒徑為1000nm 、堵塞係數α為5 及考
慮布朗運動造成之影響時，模擬之結果與實驗結果則較為吻合。關於第三部份研究，係於
計畫第二年繼續在受氯乙烯與1,2-二氯乙烷污染場址，進行模場試驗，試驗研究團隊開發的
穩定奈米鐵懸浮液配方現地灌注的成效，並進行貫穿試驗，取得適當的現地處理參數。實
驗中發現，所選用的奈米鐵分散劑，因為具有生物可分解性，亦可以提供微生物碳源及氮
源，會促進奈米鐵還原氯乙烯與1,2-二氯乙烷。由過去文獻研究得知，氯乙稀可以被奈米鐵
迅速反應還原為乙稀，如果在鈀金屬的催化下，更能加速其完全反應為乙烷，但是1,2-二氯
乙烷則是一個難以被奈米鐵還原的污染物，即使添加鈀催化的狀態下，反應速率亦相當慢。
所以現地在奈米鐵灌注後明顯觀測到1,2-二氯乙烷的降解，可以解釋為觸發生物反應的效果。
和第一年計畫中以聚丙烯酸作為分散劑的商業化奈米鐵灌注結果比較起來，由於研究中使
用的奈米鐵配方經由貫穿實驗確實可以有效傳輸，而且使得現地產生較為均勻的還原狀態，
氧化還原電位介於-450 到 -280 mV，處理成效較為顯著，未來應可推廣至含氯碳氫化合物
污染場址之實廠整治應用。

we considered when applying NZVI, usually a considerable amount of dispersants is added to 
stabilize and enhance the transport of NZVI in subsurface porous media. Not restricting the 
limitation of dispersants in stabilization, biodegradable dispersants are considered in experiments 
to enhance the remediation process. In this study, we demonstrated a pilot-scale field treatment of 
vinyl chloride (VC) and 1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) using palladium catalyzed NZVI 
dispersed with biodegradable surfactant to evaluate the effectiveness of on-site synthesized NZVI. 
VC has been known to be completely dechlorinated to ethylene at a faster rate with the 
palladium-catalized NZVI. As for 1,2-DCA, it is difficult to be reduced to ethylene by NZVI even 
with Pd catalyst. Thus, the dechlorination of 1,2-DCA and its by-products was monitored to 
observe the evidence of biodegradation. A breakthrough results showed that there was a 
significant movement in the transport of NZVI, which achieved a homogeneous reducing 
condition (Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) -450 to -280 mV) in the testing plot. Another 
eariler test result of palladized commercial NZVI dispersed by PAA was conducted to perform 
the comparison of reactivity. The additional biodegradable surfactant not only promoted colloidal 
stability but also stimulated biological processes on the transformation of vinyl chloride and 
1,2-dichloroethane, which is suited for further application of chlorinated hydrocarbons 
remediation.

where εis the porosity, dC is the collector diameter, α is the dimensionless sticking coefficient or 
attachment probability, and η is the dimensionless transport coefficient. 
A number of expressions for the transport efficiency has been developed, with RT Equation 
developed by Rajagopalan and Tien being one of the most widely used expressions [18]. A new 
equation for predicting the single-collector efficiency in physicochemical particle filtration in 
saturated porous media was presented by Tufenkji and Elimelech. [19] The new correlation 
equation was developed assuming that the overall single-collector efficiency can be calculated as 
the sum of the contributions of the individual transport mechanisms like Brownian diffusion, 
interception, and gravitational sedimentation.  
The new equation overcomes the limitations of current approaches and shows remarkable 
agreement with exact theoretical predictions of the single-collector efficiency over a wide range 
of conditions commonly encountered in natural and engineered aquatic systems. Experimental 
data are in much closer agreement with predictions based on the new correlation equation 
compared to RT equation, and the new equation is written as

1.3.3 In-situ experiments 
In situ injection and nested monitoring wells were established in a vinyl chloride and 
1,2-dichloroethane contaminated site. Fig.1.2 shows the installation prfile of injection and nested 
monitoring wells. The diameter of each well is two inches. Three injection wells were installed - 
IW1, IW2 and IW3. The interval of each injection well is two meters. Each injection well is 
eighteen meters deep with fifteen meters of screen. There were four nested monitoring wells 
installed in the groundwater downstream direction of each injection well. The intervals of the 
four nested monitoring wells were positioned one, two, three, and five meters from the injection 
well. In addition, every nested monitoring well includes three separate wells that are six, twelve 
and eighteen meters deep. The screen length of each well within a nested well is three meters.  
During the project period, a testing run of nanoiron injection was accomplished. 2,250 liters 
of nanoiron solution (total iron mass is about forty kilograms) was injected into IW2 via gravity. 
There were six groundwater sampling runs conducted to gather parameter values for the transport 
and reaction model. Each run investigated the groundwater quality in terms of pH, ORP 
(Oxidation Reduction Potential), temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total solid, 
suspended solid, volatile organic compounds, iron and dissolved iron from selected monitoring 
wells.

1.4 Results and Discussion 
1.4.1 Tests for the effects of modifiers with batch experiments 
The stability of NZVI in the aqueous phase with five different modifiers in batch type 
reactions is shown in Table 1-1. Applying nonionic surfactant A (5000 mg/L) could keep higher 
concentration of iron in the supernatant than applying other surfactants. The differences between 
surfactant A and other modifiers are that surfactant A has some partially hydrolyzed coconut oil

important in procedure of industry such as colloidal particles are transported through the porous 
media of a filter bed. So, many investigations have been developed by different experiments or 
analysis methods. (Alessi and Li, 2001; Wang, 2003; Wan, 2005; Yang, 2006; etc.) 
2.2.2 DLVO theory 
DLVO theory was developed by Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek. 
(Ruckenstein, 1976; Rajagopalan, 1981), which describes the interaction forces between 
charged particles. The theory is applied for predicting the colloidal stability. In the theory, the 
repulsive electrostatic term is the source for a stable suspension, on the other hand, the 
attractive van der Waals force derives flocculation of the particles.  
According to DLVO theory, the total potential energy in DLVO theory between two 
particles is given by:

2.2.2.1 Van der Waals forces  
Van der Waals force results from the interactions between oscillating dipoles within the 
interacting media. When the macroscopic particles are considered, the van der Waals 
attraction in vacuum relies on the geometry and dimensions of bodies. According to 
Ruckenstein and Prieve (1976), the dimensionless force of Van der Waals c repulsion 
between two particles is given by:

2.2.3 The transport behavior model of the nanoscale particle in groundwater layer 
To accurately simulated the transport behavior of the ZNVI in subsurface environment, 
we define collectors of soil particle in groundwater layer connected by network as shown in

assumed that the filter bed is composed of a number of unit bed elements (UBEs) or collectors 
connected in series, The UBEs are uniform in thickness and are statistically similar. Each UBE 
contains a number of unit cells of the shape of the constricted tube with a given size distribution. 
The schematic diagram for simulating deposition of nanoscale particles in a constricted tube is

simulating deposition of nanoscale particles by trajectory analysis in a constricted tube. 
Simulations were performed on a two-dimensional network with NL=50×50, and the influent 
flow rate is kept at constant. The estimation of the permeability ratio C/C0 based on the Brownian 
trajectory analysis and the stochastic simulation procedure for different types of DLVO 
interaction energy curves will be given below first. Then, by comparing with the available 
experimental data obtained by Soo and Radke (1984), Soo et al. (1986), and Stephan and Chase 
(2003), the accuracy of the present simulation method will be discussed in a later section.

The random number ܽ௜ (rang is 0 to 1 ) in Eq. (3-12) can be generated by computer 
software and ݎ௠௘௔௡ can also be applied to determine the particle size distribution randomly 
in the computer simulations described as follows. Chen (2001) suggested that both the radius 
and the mean radius of collectors should described by Raleigh distribution. However, it will 
increase the processing time as the calculating procedures become more complicated. In 
addition, the distribution of particle is uniform based on the results of NZVI characteristic in 
this study. Therefore, we assume that radius of particles is steady but the radius of collectors 
follows Raleigh distribution.

2.3.3.2 Procedure of trajectory analysis 
With consideration of the inertia term in the force balance equation and of the specification 
of the flow fluid around the collector, the particle trajectory can be determined by integrating the

2.3.3.3 The condition of adsorbent for particles and obstruct for collectors 
While mode calculating the absorbable trajectory of particles, the determination of 
adsorbent for particles is very important. In this study, a particle was decided it absorb on 
collector when it touch the collector. In other words, a particle was absorbed on collector when 
the distance between the center of particle and tube wall smaller than or equal to the radius of 
particle. In addition, the particle left the collector when the determination of particles is more 
than the length of collector.   
The condition of collectors for obstruct was described by the filter coefficientሺαሻ, where α 
is a correctional value in the model, it indicate the degree of obstruct of collectors. The condition 
of collectors for obstruct was defined as:

4.1.2 The Stability of NZVI 
Enhanced stability of the particles is further characterized by increasing surface potential. 
In practice, the electric potential closed to the surface of the particle is often measured to be an 
indicator of the surface potential. A survey of literature suggests that a zeta-potential of at least 
±30mV is needed for maintaining the stable suspension. As shown in Figure 4.1, NZVI particles 
had slight positive charges (>10 mV) in  neutral pH range. The zeta-potential is negative only 
when pH is higher than 8.2. Thus, the positively charged of NVZI particles are expected to be 
attracted to aquifer materials resulting in limited mobility in subsurface environment.  
Addition of PAA altered the NVZI surface charge to be negative over a much wider pH 
range where the concentrations of PAA and iron both are at 5000ppm. As shown in Figure 4.2, 
the NZVI was modified with PAA exhibited negative charge at pH≥5.5. Reactions of NZVI with 
water typically result in the increase of water pH. Hence, the NZVI was modified with PAA has 
better transport in subsurface environment.

2.4.3 Transport of NZVI in soil column 
 Transport of NZVI was described by Permeability of NZVI suspensions that defined as 
concentrate rate of initial and final after though the soil column. The permeability was decrease 
when soil column was washed with PAA because PAA has a lower pH value. So, the following 
are conditions of the experiment of soil column. The soil column was washed by deoxidized 
water until the conductivity steadied. In addition, the length of the soil column is 10 cm, and the 
concentrate of NZVI and PAA for though the soil column were 2500 ppm.  
The results of the permeability are shown in figure 4.4 where we injected 853.8 mg NZVI 
into soil column. In other words, the dose of the NZVI is 4.86 pore volume with the soil column 
experiment. As follow on figure 4.4, there has a lower postponement with NZVIs and soil 
particles because the maximum of permeability (90%) at 1 pore volume. In addition, the steady 
permeability was about 75%.

column were inject into with its.

0.05Z. We detected the difference between two situation was little. So, it suggested that the affect 
of size ofΔZ with the accuracy of permeability in unit collector was little. 
 
Figure 4.6 the permeability of NZVI suspensions was simulated by three networks in same 
situation 
2.4.4.3 Comparison with the experimental data 
The parameters in the model are shown in Table 3.2. Each collector (soil particle) in the 
model performs a random distribution. We performed the simulation of soil column by 50×50 
network model. Because the length of restricted pipe is 0.02 cm, the 50×50 network model is 
equal to 1 cm. Assume the properties in soil column longitude direction is homogeneous in the 
whole experiment. Therefore, the soil permeability of particles passing each 1 cm soil is same. 
We can obtain the permeability of 10 cm soil by multiply the permeability of each 1 cm soil.   
 
Figure 4. 7 the simulate results when we assume that the particle diameter to 100nm, αgoes to 5. 
Compared the result of simulation to the experimental result (such as figure4.7), we find 
the model is overestimated. Assume that the error is induced by follow. First, We continuous 
injected NZVI suspension (the concentration of PAA and iron is 5000 ppm and 2500 ppm,

Figure 4.9 The relation of collector diameter and particle permeability with particle diameter of 
1000nm in unit collector 
2.4.4.6 Effect of permeability of NZVI following the velocity of fluid 
In order to realize the relation between average velocity of fluid and particle permeability, 
we selected the collector with 0.004 cm diameter. From figure 4.10, we observed the permeability 
is around 76% at that time. It is difficult to compare the average velocity of fluid and particle 
permeability if we choose a larger or smaller collector because the size will affect the 
permeability. Table 3.1 shows all the parameters in the model. Table 4.40 shows the relations 
between different average velocities of fluid and filtered particle with 1000nm diameter in unit 
collector. We conclude when the average velocities of fluid is less than 0.1 cm/sec, the average 
velocities of fluid performs no effect on the particle. However, when he average velocities of 
fluid is more than 0.1 cm/sec, average velocities of fluid is proportional to the particle 
permeability. That is because when fluid velocity is small, the attraction force produced by the 
surface of collector is larger than the traction force of flow and vice versus. That makes the 
particle displacement with respect to the collector flow lines smaller, as a result, the amount of 
particle passing the collector is increasing.

In this paper, we demonstrated a 40-m2 pilot-scale field treatment of vinyl chloride (VC) 
and 1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) using palladium catalyzed NZVI dispersed with 
biodegradable surfactant to evaluate the effectiveness of on-site synthesized NZVI. With VC 
already reduced and resistant to further reduction, the observed reaction rate of VC normalized to 
the surface area of zero valent iron is about as low as (5.0±1.5) × 10-5 (L m-2 h-1) (Johnson et al. 
1996). However, VC would be completely dechlorinated to ethylene within one hour of using 
palladium-catalized NZVI (Lien and Zhang 2001). As for 1,2-DCA, it is difficult to be reduced to 
ethylene by NZVI even with Pd catalyst. The observed reaction rate of 1,2-DCA with NZVI is 
smaller than (5.0× 10-5h-1)(Song and Carraway 2005). While VC could be quickly reduced by 
palladized NZVI, 1,2-DCA could not. Thus, the dechlorination of 1,2-DCA and its by-products 
was monitored to observe the evidence of biodegradation. Two different kinds of NZVI injections 
were applied in two different rounds, which were palladized commercial NZVI dispersed by poly 
acrylic acid (PAA) and on-site synthesized NZVI dispersed by biodegradable surfactant. During 
Round 1, 2,250 liters of diluted commercial nano-iron solution, with a total iron mass of forty 
kilograms and Pd 0.1 wt%, was injected by gravity. In Round 2, another 8,500 liters of NZVI 
solution with a total iron mass of twenty kilograms and Pd 0.05 wt% was also injected via gravity. 
Samples were periodically collected from thirteen multi-level monitoring wells situated in three 
different depths (6, 12, 18 m) in various days from Round 1 and 2 for a duration of three months. 
A breakthrough test and monitoring transport of NZVI were also conducted to evaluate the 
mobility of NZVI. The additional biodegradable surfactant not only promoted colloidal stability 
but also stimulated biological processes on the transformation of vinyl chloride and 
1,2-dichloroethane at this site. 
 
3.2 Site description  
 
The potential pollution source of pilot test plot came from a vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) 
manufacturing plant located in southern Taiwan. The NZVI pilot test was conducted in a small 
plot (10 meters by 20 meters) south of the VCM plant in downstream groundwater direction. In 
the manufacturing process, VCM is produced by pyrolysis of 1,2-DCA, which flows through 
tubes positioned inside the furnace to form a mixture of VCM, 1,2-DCA, and byproducts. The 
primary contaminant inside the plant is 1,2-DCA. However, high concentrations of VC 
(46.7±4.16 μM), 1,2-DCA (2.0±0.51 μM), 1,1-dichloroethane (4.4±0.41 μM), 
1,1-dichloroethylene (3.8±1.1 μM), cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (9.8±3.5 μM) and TCE (4.3±1.5 μM) 
in groundwater were detected from the monitoring well nearby the plant and in groundwater 
downstream direction (Fig. 3.1).  
 
At the test plot, the unconfined aquifer, composed of medium to coarse sand and few silt, 
lies approximately 4 to 18 meters below ground surface (m bgs).  Based on the pumping test, the 
transmissivity is 4349 m2/day, specific yield is 0.275 cm/sec and the anisotropy is 14.3.  The 
natural gradient at the site is approximately 0.0012 m/m. 
 
 36
Three injection wells and thirteen nested multi-level monitoring wells were installed on a 
40-square-meter plot.  In the downstream direction of each injection well, four additional 
multi-level monitoring wells were installed.  The positions of the four nested monitoring wells 
were approximately one, two, three, and five meters from the injection well. The injection wells 
were all eighteen-meter deep with fifteen-meter screens.  In addition, every nested monitoring 
well included three separate wells which were approximately six, twelve and eighteen-meter deep 
with three-meter screens, respectively (Fig.3.2). These three separate wells at different 
descending levels are also referred to as upper, middle, and bottom layers in this paper to indicate 
the positions of the samples. There was one nested monitoring well located upstream for the 
purpose of background monitoring.

3.3.3 Field experiment setup  
 
Two different kinds of NZVI injection were applied in two rounds. The field chronology is 
listed in Table 1. In Round 1, 2,250 liters of diluted commercial nanoiron solution purchased 
from Lehigh Nanotech, LLC. was injected into Well IW-2 via gravity. The total iron mass was 
forty kilograms with an additional 400 grams of palladium catalyst. Duing Round 2, 1,000 liters 
of on-site synthesized NZVI was injected into Well IW-3 by gravity. Another 7,500 liters of 
NZVI suspension was injected into IW-1 via gravity after ten days. The total iron mass was about 
20 kilograms companioned with 100g of palladium catalyst (0.5‰ of total iron mass). NZVI was

3.4.1 Verification of NZVI property 
Using dispersants to modify NZVI may result in the change of surface property (Loraine 2001). 
In terms of specific surface area, XRD and FTIR spectra, surfactant dispersed NZVI in this 
research showed similar properties as those found in other literatures. The specific surface area is 
29.3 m2/g, close to that dispersed by PAA at 20-30 m2/g by Schrick et al.(2004), but significantly 
lower than that dispersed by starch at 55 m2/g by He and Zhao (2005). XRD spectra in Fig. 3.3 
showed presence of crystalline Fe0 and also FeO, as were evident in Sun et al. (2006) too. NZVI 
coated with surfactant is suspected to decrese the intensity of XRD spectra. Howerver, according 
to our labtorary experiment, the surfactant modified NZVI with palladium catalyst still performed 
at a rapid reaction rate to completely dechlorinate 40 μM of VC within one hour. The surfactant 
applied in our study could be described as readily biodegradable since it is fully degradable in a 
28-day standard test for biodegradability in aerobic condition (Madsen et al. 2001). One of the 
tests had shown that in an anaerobic condition, the biodegradability of the surfactant has an 
inhibiting effect on the degrading bacteria (Larsen and Andersen 2006). Long-chain fatty acids as 
a hydrophobic group of surfactant metabolized from unfractionated cocoyl hydrocarbon might be 
recognized as being inhibitory to anaerobic microorganisms (Hanaki et al. 1981; Koster and 
Cramer 1987). FTIR spectra indicated that the interaction between surfactant and NaBH4 or 
NZVI did not alter the primary aliphatic amines as illustrated by peaks at 3400 and 1650. The 
properties of surfactant remained intact despite a minor shift in peaks.

spectra of NZVI 
 
3.4.2 Breakthrough of NZVI in field   
Fig. 3.4 shows the breakthrough of NZVI in the monitoring well that was in the vicinity of 
the injection well. The distance between injection well IW-1 and monitoring well #1m1 is 1.05 
meters. In this cylindrical column with 1.05 meters as the diameter, the pore volume is estimated 
by the volume timing porosity (0.38), which is 18,000 liters. The concentrations of TOC and 
NZVI in the middle and bottom layers reached their peaks when the injected volume was at 
19,000 liters, which were close to those projected at estimated value of 18,000 liters. However, 
 40
conducted between Round 1 and Round 2. The high flow rate of water during the pumping test 
may have remobilized NZVI in the aquifer towards well #5M2 locating near the pumping well.

(b) middle, and (c) bottom layers 
 
3.4.4 Changes in ORP and pH through monitoring 
The Eh and pH profiles at given locations over time can be used as convenient indicators 
for NZVI reactivity (Elliott and Zhang 2001; Loraine 2001; Zhang 2003). As illustrated in Fig. 
3.6, ORP detected during Round 2 after injection was significantly lower than that during Round 
1. The injection wells in both rounds had ORP maintained at a lower level than -400 mV, which 
indicated that NZVI induced strongly-reducing conditions suitable for the dehalogenation of 
more reduced contaminants such as dichloroethylene or VC. The initial background ORP was 
found at between -100 mV to -300 mV, which indicated that the anaerobic condition in 
groundwater aquifer at this site had existed prior to our field study. Under the anaerobic condition, 
1,2-DCA can be degraded by abiotic pathways using hydrolysis or dehydrohalogenation (Barbash 
and Reinhard 1989; Jeffers et al. 1989) to produce ethylene glycol upon neutral hydrolysis. For 
VC, in applying alkaline condition and biotic pathways (dihaloelimination or hydrogenolysis), it 
is able to produce up to 1% of VC as intermediate but mostly as ethene (Maymo-Gatell et al. 
1999). However, the half-life for abiotic reaction of 1,2-DCA has been reported to be 72 years 
(Jeffers et al. 1989). Though the half-life of reaction can decrease to 6 years by the presence of 
50mM phosphate buffer and 0.67mM sodium sulfide (Barbash and Reinhard 1989), the reaction 
rate is still at the low level in our study. The higher concentration of VC accumulated at 
downgradient source of 1,2-DCA implies that biodegradation had existed prior to injection of 
NZVI.  
During Round 1, ORP in the middle layer was found in the consistent range of below 
-200mV, while those in the upper and bottom layers fell somewhere higher than -200 mV. Many 
factors may have contributed to these differences in ORP. Silt found in the middle layer may have 
slowed the groundwater flow even under high-flow condition of  summertime. The slower flow 
is suited to accumulate plant debris and organic contents such as humic acids for biotic reactions 
(Bradley et al. 1998) or iron pyrite precipitates for abiotic reactions (Kriegman-King and 
Reinhard 1994), which all may have encouraged an anaerobic condition. The increase in ORP in 
Round 2 Day 4 may be indicative of oxygenated water that was withdrawn from groundwater for 
conditioning the site and to synethize NZVI. The ORP value kept low at between -245mV to 
-380mV in Round 2 after Day 36 indicated that a higher number of microorganisms might had 
been present containing strongly reduced electron carriers such as transiton-metal cofactors, 
vitamin B12 or iron(II)porphyrins. 
The pH value was expected to increase when the oxidation of zero-valent iron took place 
and hydroxyl ions were produced (Gillham and Ohannesin 1994). Data showed that the pH 
values (Fig. 3.7) is correlated to the iron distribution. With a higher concentration of iron in the 
upper layer and the injection well in both rounds, there was a slight increase in the pH value as 
opposed to unnoticeable increase in the pH value in either the middle or bottom layer. The lower 
pH condition agrees with the observation of one 1,2-DCA contaminated site in natural attenuation 
condition reported by Nobre and Nobre (2004). Most of the well locations in our field study had a 
pH value between 6 to 7, which is within the optimum range for biodegradation of chlorinated 
solvents (Wiedemeier et al. 1998).  
 42
 
3.4.5 Reduction of VC and 1,2-DCA   
The concentrations of VC monitored at different time periods for the upper, medium and 
bottom layers of #1m2 to #5m2 and the background well during Round 1, and of #1m1 to #5m1 
and the background well during Round 2 are summarized in Fig. 8. The concentration distribution 
at the field site was depth-dependent, where contaminant concentrations increased with depth. 
However VC concentration showed a steady decrease during Round 1 and Round 2. In Round 2, 
VC concentration had a significant drop on Day 11, as compared to Day 4 when NZVI had not 
yet been injected in IW1 and VC concentration was still at a level that revealed the strong 
reduction nearby the injection well. The significant peak of well #1m1 in upper and middle layers 
on Day 4 could have been caused by heterogeneous aquifer that shifted the contaminants in 
groundwater after an injection in IW3. As for Round 1, data from the middle layer  reflected a 
more irregular trend, whether the fluctuation was caused by the reduction of parent compounds 
has yet to be determined. The higher level of concentrations found in the bottom layer of well 
#1m2 in Round 1 may have been the aging NZVI in causing the incomplete reduction after 14 
days of injection. The ORP of well #1m2-3 was between -136 ~-170 mV (except for the -348 mV 
on Day 34 and -244 mV on Day 47), which could also explain the situation. 
 
Fig. 3.8 VC concentration in Round 1 (left column) and Round 2 (right column) in (a) (b) upper, 
(c) (d) middle, and (e) (f) bottom layers 
 
While 1,2-DCA reduction in Fig. 3.9 showed a similar trend as VC concentration in Fig. 8, 
the decrease in concentration was not as significant as VC. Due to the slow reduction of 1,2-DCA 
with palladized NZVI, the decrease in concentration was suspected as the result of biodegradation. 
In Round 2, except for the bottom layer in Day 4, all other layers showed a considerable decrease 
in concentration over time. This could be explained by the fact that NZVI was not yet injected in 
IW1 in Day 4, and the decrease in concentration did not take place until after Day 11. The 
decrease was not subjected to the reduction by NZVI, but possibly by enhanced biodegradation

ABSTRACT: Two different kinds of palladium-catalyzed and surfactant dispersed 
nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) were used in a pilot-scale field site in southern 
Taiwan for the treatment of contaminated groundwater containing vinyl chloride and 
1,2-dichloroethane.  NZVI injections were applied in two rounds.  In Round 1, 2,250 
liters of diluted commercial nano-iron solution, with a total iron mass of forty kilograms, 
was injected by gravity.  In Round 2, another 8,500 liters on-site synthesized NZVI 
solution with a total iron mass of about twenty kilograms were also injected via gravity.  
From monitoring the concentration breakthrough and the changes in the concentration 
of iron in the monitoring wells, it was discovered that NZVI had a tendency to stay in 
the upper layer of the aquifer.  The concentrations of the chlorinated volatile organic 
compounds (CVOCs) monitored in various days in Round 1 and 2 for upper and lower 
layers showed that both NZVI and biological processes had significant effects on the 
transformation of vinyl chloride and 1,2-dichloroethane at this site.  While abiotic 
processes might had slowed down gradually, it appeared that the biological processes 
had been triggered and lasted longer. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Field and laboratory experiments have demonstrated that zero valence iron (ZVI) is 
an effective reducing agent for the dechlorination of dissolved poly-chlorinated ethane 
and ethylene, and other compounds in aqueous systems (Matheson and Tratnyek, 1994; 
Roberts et al., 1996; Arnold and Roberts, 2000; Cheng and Wu, 2000).  ZVI has also 
been used in funnel-and-gate systems, with itself as the key reactive ingredient in the 
permeable reactive barriers (PRBs).  However, the disadvantages of using ZVI in 
PRBs are the high cost of constructing the reactive permeable walls, and low flexibility 
of any following-up adjustment to the original constructed system. 
Nano-scale zero valence iron (NZVI) may serve as an alternative to the conventional 
ZVI PRBs.  When NZVI is used, some particles are filtered by straining and attaching 
to soil grains to establish an in-situ treatment zone for remediation, while others flow 
along with groundwater and remain in suspension for a certain distance.  A deploying

positions of the four nested monitoring wells were approximately one, two, three, and  
five meters from the injection well. The injection wells were all eighteen-meter deep 
with fifteen-meter screens.  In addition, every nested monitoring well included three 
separate wells which were approximately six, twelve and eighteen-meter deep with 
three-meter screens (Figure 2). 
There was one nested monitoring well located upstream for the purpose of 
background monitoring.  
 
Field Chronology. Two different 
kinds of NZVI injection were 
applied in two rounds (Table 1).  
In Round 1, 2,250 liters of diluted 
commercial nanoiron solution 
purchased from Lehigh Nanotech, 
LLC. was injected into Well IW-2 
via gravity.  The total iron mass 
was forty kilograms with an 
additional 400 grams of palladium 
catalyst.  In Round 2, 1,000 liters 
of on-site synthesized NZVI were 
injected into Well IW-3 by gravity.  
Another 7,500 liters of NZVI 
suspension was injected into IW-1 
via gravity after ten days.  The 
total iron mass was about 20 
kilograms companioned with 100g 
of palladium catalyst (0.5‰ of total 
iron mass).  NZVI was synthesized 
by slowly adding ferrous sulfate 
solution into sodium boronhydrate solution containing a nonionic surfactant in a 
1,000-liter tank.  After the reaction was complete, palladium acetate dissolved in 
methanol was mixed with the NZVI suspension.  The NZVI mixture was then pumped 
into a storage tank for later injection.  Prior to the start of Round 2, 1,000 liters of 
nonionic surfactant solution was injected into the aquifer to condition the aquifer.  The 
groundwater samples were collected at various time intervals to monitor the 
performance of the field tests. Dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation reduction potential 
(ORP) and pH were measured by a portable equipment (YSI 650 MDS-6600 V2-4 
Sonde, YSI Inc.).  A TOC detector (TOC 101, OI Corporation) was applied to measure 
total organic carbon.  Total dissolved iron was detected by UV detector at 562nm by 
adding ascorbic acid (1% w/v) and ferrozine (3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis (4-phenylsulfonic 
acid)-1,2,4-triazine) to the 0.45 μ m-membrane-filtered sample.  Total iron was 
measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Aanalyst 800) after 
acid digestion.  Volatile organic compounds were measured by GC/MS (Angilent 
6890/5973 with a DB-624 capillary column) using a purge and trap sampling equipment 
(OI Analytical. Model 4560). Methane, ethane and ethene were measured from the 
headspace of serum vials containing water samples after equilibration.  The headspace

reached 19,000 liters, with the volume matching the estimated value of 18,000 liters.  
However, the breakthrough of TOC or iron was also found in the upper layer at an 
earlier stage of the test injection.  It is believed that with the injection via gravity, much 
of the NZVI first seeped through channels in the unsaturated zone, causing NZVI to 
accumulate more in the upper layer as compared to those in the lower layer.  Hence, 
iron breakthrough concentration becomes lower in the deeper layer, at only 40 mg/L, 
which is significantly lower than 800 mg/L (50% of the injected concentration) 
estimated based on the laboratory data.  Comparing iron concentration in both upper 
and lower layers (Figure 4 and Figure 5), iron concentration in the upper layer found 
during Round 2 was significantly higher than that found in Round 1.  In Round 1 with 
low-volume injection, the difference in concentration between its upper and lower 
layers was not significant and remained under 50 mg/L.  These results indicate that to 
allow NZVI to distribute uniformly in aquifers, injection should be conducted in 
different sections of the intended area, and a confinded deposit of NZVI can be 
mobilized and spreaded via water circulation.

Reduction of CVOCs  The concentrations of CVOCs monitored in various times in 
Round 1 and 2 for the upper layer and the lower layer are shown in Figure 6 to Figure 9. 
From Figure 6 and 7, it is clear that the concentration of VC steadily decreases as the 
test date progresses, with the exceptions of the surges found in Round 2.  While the 
same phenomenon is found in Figure 8 and 9 for EDC reduction, the decrease in 
concentration is not as significant as VC.  The average removal rate was 20-90% in 
Round 1 and 24-98% in Round 2 for VC, while the EDC concentration reduction 
showed 11-80% in Round 1 and 0-90% in Round 2.  Ethylene concentration was also 
measured in Round 2 to understand the reduction of VC and chlorinated ethylene by 
NZVI during the treatments. It is likely that most of the degradation through the 
monitoring period was predominantly abiotic. According to the study done by Henn and 
Waddill (2006), biological degradation was found after 155 days of NZVI injection, 
while our results revealed biological degradation in only 25 days.  This was detected 
by the sudden increase in methane concentration shown in Figure 8 and 9.  It is
