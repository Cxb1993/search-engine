An Adaptive RBFNN-Based Autopilot Design for 
Bank-To-Turn Missiles Subject to Actuator Saturation

Abstract 
The neural network-based autopilot of bank-to-turn (BTT) missiles has successfully 
overcome the undesired coupling effects between pitch and yaw motions due to rapid roll motion. 
However, the saturation effects of actuator have not been considered in most researches. 
Therefore, a radial basis function network is used to compensate the saturation part of a 
first-order actuator. Simulation results demonstrates the effectiveness. 
Index Terms - bank-to-turn missile, autopilot, radial basis function network, adaptive robust 
control. 
nonlinear functions with better local learning capability than sigmoid-type multi-layer neural 
networks, plays an important role in the actuator compensation scheme. Then the purpose of this 
paper is to present an intelligent compensation scheme for a first-order actuator represented as a 
linear first-order actuator with nonlinearities that can be eliminated by the RBFNN. Nevertheless, 
the stability and tracking performance can also be guaranteed. 
The organization of the paper is as in the following. Firstly, the RBFNN and dynamics of 
actuators are described in Section II. Then, the RBFNN-based autopilot structure and stability 
analysis are presented in Section III, where medical radiograph analysis is utilized as a test 
vehicle. In Section IV, simulation results are demonstrated, and Section V concludes the paper. 
II. PRELIMINARIES 
A. Radial basis function Network 
An n-input and m-output RBFNN consists of three layers: input layer, hidden layer, and output 
layer. The neurons in hidden layer called the radial basis functions (RBFs) are linear combined to 
produce the outputs as

  = , j=1, ..., p (2) 
with inverse variance ji and center cji. Thus, the output vector of the RBFNN can be expressed as

that the RBFNN can approximate any continuous function over a compact set  to arbitrary any 
accuracy [17], i.e., there exists an ideal RBFNN, ( , , )TW x c  , with ideal parameters c, , and

Assume the inverse of known matrix G(x), G1(x), exists and the unknown functions f(x) and 
d(x) are approximated by a pre-determined function ˆ ( )f x and ˆ( )d x , respectively, then the 
control law can be selected as

where Ks=diag{Ks1, Ks2, Ks3}>0 and 1ˆd is used to attenuate uncertainties including approximation 
errors and external disturbances. Substituting (24) into (23) yields 
1ˆ( ) ( )s= + +  s K s f x d x d , (25) 
where ˆ( ) ( ) ( )= f x f x f x and ˆ( ) ( ) ( )= d x d x d x . Thus, the control goal is to design an 
adaptive autopilot of the BTT missile system, which can suppress approximation errors and track 
the desired trajectory while maintaining a small sideslip angle. The whole architecture of the 
autopilot is shown in Fig. 3. 
Assumption 2: The approximation error ( )f x in (25) is bounded by a known constant, i.e.,  
( ) ff x .
Assumption 3: The inverse of known matrix G(x), G1(x), exists and 11 1

positive constants GM and Gm .
B. Stability Analysis 
It is assumed that there exist ideal weights W such that TW  is the ideal approximator of 
d(x). According to the approximation capability of RBFNN, the ideal TW  can be 
approximated by ˆˆ TW  . Thus, the objective of the autopilot design is to achieve good tracking 
performance and guaranteed stability with cˆ , ˆ , and Wˆ tuned on-line. In order to accomplish 
this goal by Lyapunov theory extension, the RBFs are linearized. Thus, take the expansion of 
ˆ =  in a Taylor series to obtain 
where ˆdk is used to approximate dk .
Assumption 4: The ideal vector dk is bounded by a known constant, i.e., dd kMk , and 
therefore

Hence, T sL   s K s for all t,0, and if s(t), W , c ,  , and dk are bounded at initial time 
t=0, they will remain bounded for all t,0. According to e(0) and s(0) are bounded, e(t) and s(t) are 
bounded for all t,0, and since ( )d ty is bounded as specified, ( )ty is bounded as well. All W ,
c ,  , and dk are bounded indicates all weights Wˆ , cˆ , ˆ , and ˆdk are bounded.

We can observe that ( )1s denotes the solution of ( ; , (0))ts u s  to the system ( )s t given by (25) 
and every bounded term in (42) implies bL is a uniformly continuous function of time. Since 
( ( ))bL ts is nonnegative, and ( ( )) 0bL t  s for all time t, using Barbalat’s lemma can prove that 
( ( )) 0bL t - s and hence s(t)- 0 as t- .. 
V. SIMULATION RESULTS 
A comparison of compensated with non-compensated adaptive controller confirms that the 
former can deal with the saturated effects. We simulated an 18-second flight scenario which 
operated within 0.5 to 4.5 Mach and 0 to 35 Km, velocity and height range respectively. The 
desired commands of the four principal flight conditions are: 
1. "c=0°, Ayc=0G, and Azc=–50G (G=9.8m/s2), 
2. "c=135°, Ayc=0G, and Azc=–20G, 
3. "c=90°, Ayc=0G, and Azc=–10G, 
4. "c=0°, Ayc=0G, and Azc=–5G.

VI. CONCLUSION 
The RBFNN-based compensation part has been incorporated into the autopilot of BTT 
missiles for suppress the actuator saturation. All parameters of the RBFNN are tuned on-line and 
the stability can be guaranteed by Lyapunov theorem. The simulation results have successfully 
illustrate the effectiveness.
