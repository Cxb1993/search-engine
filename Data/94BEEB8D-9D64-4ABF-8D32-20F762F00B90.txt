2high profile (thickness 2 mm). However, it is inherently obvious for a PIFA or microstrip
antenna that lowering the antenna profile would degrade its antenna gain. In order to improve the
gain of a low-profile antenna and provide applicable reading range, array antennas are considered
to be effective candidates. However, to date, little research has been done on the development of
the RFID tag in an array antenna.
In this paper, we propose two different designs of low-profile PIFA array antennas for UHF
band RFID tags that are mounted on metallic objects. In the first design [see Fig. 1(a)], with
shorting pins placed at the outer edges of the patches, two quarter-wavelength microstrip lines
without matching stub are applied for the excitation of a two-element PIFA array antenna. Note
that the two microstrip lines acts not only as an impedance transformer to achieve conjugate
impedance matching between the antenna and tag chip, but also as a phase-reversal device that
makes the surface currents of the two PIFAs in phase, thus achieving the enhanced antenna gain.
As for the second design (see Fig. 6), with shorting pins placed at the inner edges of the patches,
two quarter-wavelength microstrip lines with two additional matching stubs are needed in order
to achieve conjugate impedance matching, and bandwidth improvement is obtained, as compared
to the first design. Both proposed tag array antennas were fabricated on thin FR4 substrates, and
the effects of the spacing between the PIFAs on RFID tag reading range in the presence of metal
plates are investigated. The details of the proposed designs and the obtained experimental results
are presented and discussed.
II. ARRAY ANTENNA FED BY TWO QUARTER-WAVELENGTH
MICROSTRIP LINES WITHOUT MATCHING STUB
Fig. 1(a) shows the first PIFA array antenna proposed, which is fed by two
quarter-wavelength microstrip lines without any additional matching stub. The antenna is
designed for operating in the 902 to 928 MHz frequency band that is used in UHF band RFID
system in several countries such as North America. It consists of two identical PIFAs and two
identical quarter-wavelength microstrip lines that make the structure symmetrical. A very thin
FR4 substrate with a thickness of h = 0.8 mm and dielectric constant of r = 4.4 is used to
fabricate the antenna. Each PIFA with dimensions L W has a shorting pin with a radius of 0.2
mm located at the outer edge of the patch to reduce the patch size, and it is designed to roughly
resonate as a quarter-wavelength structure. The spacing between the centers of the two PIFAs is S.
The two quarter-wavelength microstrip lines with lengthand width t are used to connect the tag
chip, which is attached to a plastic strap with metallic pads, to the antenna. Note that the
quarter-wavelength microstrip lines are bent into meander-line sections, which facilitates the
spacing S adjusting and the optimal antenna gain obtaining. The ground-plane size is GLGW. To
verify gain-enhanced characteristic, reference antenna A1 that has only a PIFA structure and
reference antenna A2 that comprises two PIFAs and is directly fed by tag chip are compared with
the proposed first array antenna. Their design parameters are shown in Fig. 1(b) and 1(c),
respectively.
There are two primary considerations that affect the successful design of the first array
antenna: the excitation of the surface currents on the two PIFAs, and the impedance matching
between the antenna and chip. First, we consider the excitation of the surface current for the
antenna. Fig. 2 shows the simulated surface current distributions of the antenna at the frequency
of 915 MHz, obtained using the commercial software Ansoft HFSS. A sinusoidal curve that
indicates the intensity of the current on the PIFAs and microstrip lines is also superimposed on
this figure. We can see that since the total paths of the two quarter-wave microstrip lines result in
180o phase shift, the excited surface currents in the two PIFAs are in the same phase. This result
can lead to constructive radiation and enhanced gain for the antenna. Next, we consider the
design of impedance matching. The tag chip used in this design is Alien Higgs, which exhibits an
impedance of 13 j111  at 915 MHz. In order to deliver the maximum power between the
antenna and chip, the input impedance of the antenna needs to be 13 + j111 . From symmetry,
the impedance ZA at point A as shown in Fig. 1(a) should be 6.5 + j55.5. In order to obtain the
desired impedance value, three adjustable parameters are employed: the width t of the
4the reading range of the array antenna decreases by increasing the metal-plate size. It should be
mentioned that the operating frequencies and impedance characteristics of the array antenna are
insignificantly affected by varying the metal-plat size. The degradation in the reading range can
be explained by the result of the surface current distribution for the array antenna mounted on the
400 400 mm2 metal plate as illustrated in Fig. 6, in which the current intensity on the metal
plate is exaggeratedly plotted for clarity. It is seen that strong currents are excited on both left and
right regions of the metal plate near the shorting pins of the antenna, and their current directions
are opposite to that on the center region of the metal plate. This behavior may cause some
canceling effects in the radiation patterns, resulting in the degradation of the reading range.

III. ARRAY ANTENNA FED BY TWO QUARTER-WAVELENGTH
MICROSTRIP LINES WITH TWO MATCHING STUBS
To improve bandwidth performance and overcome the degradation of the reading range due
to the use of a metal platform in the first PIFA array antenna in Section II, a second PIFA array
antenna is proposed, as shown in Fig. 7. The main differences between the second and first array
structures are the locations of shorting pins and the inclusions of the matching stubs. In the
second array design, each PIFA now has two shorting pins, and the locations of the two shorting
pins are changed to the inner edge of the patch with a distance d away from the center line (x-axis)
of the patch. It is then expected that when the second array antenna is mounted on the metal plate,
the excited current in the metal plate can be significantly lowered and thus the degradation of the
reading range can be improved, as compared to the first array design. However, since the feed
point (at point B in Fig. 7) of the PIFA is now located close to the shorting pins, the current has a
maximum value at point B, and a low impedance value of ZB is found there. This condition makes
it difficult to transform the impedance ZB to a desired impedance value ZA = 6.5 + j55.5at point
A by selecting a suitable characteristic impedance of a quarter-wavelength microstrip line without
matching stub. Thus, in the second array design, a meander-line stub of width ts and total length
s is considered to be connected in shunt at point A.
The design procedure of the second array antenna can be developed as follows. First, the
impedance ZB at point B is designed to be about 17  at 915 MHz when the parameters are
selected at L = 31 mm, W = 22 mm, and d = 2.5 mm, which were obtained from the software
Ansoft HFSS. The quarter-wavelength microstrip line of the length= 46.5 mm and width t = 0.6
mm with a characteristic impedance of 80.7  is used to transform ZB to an impedance value of
383  at its other end. In order to obtain a matched condition, the meander-line stub with a
reactance of j57 will be needed in shunt at point A. The length s of the stub that gives this
reactance can be estimated by the following formula:
6second array antenna is mounted on the metal plate. This result indicates very good tolerance to
metal platform. The little effect of the metal plane on the reading range is largely because in this
array design, the shorting pins are moved to the inner edges of the patches, and the excited
surface current is less distributed in the metal plate close to the outer edges of the patches, as
shown in Fig. 12. However, probably because the inclusions of the stubs in the second array
design cause a large standing wave on the stub line, the optimal reading range in free space is 0.6
m less than that of the first array antenna with the same spacing S = 66 mm. In conclusion, the
second PIFA array antenna is selected as a promising antenna that is suitable for achieving a
broad bandwidth and high gain in very low profile and metal proximity use.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
Two novel PIFA array antennas fed by quarter-wavelength microstrip lines with or without
matching stubs have been successfully implemented. The results show that an enhanced gain and
optimal reading range can be obtained for both array antennas by selecting the spacing between
the PIFAs to be about 0.2 free-space wavelength. For the first array without matching stub, the
optimal reading range reaches about 3.1 m, but it is degraded when the antenna is mounted on a
metal object. For the second array with matching stubs, the optimal reading range is about 2.5 m,
and less performance degradation is achieved when the antenna is mounted on a metal object.
Also, the obtained impedance bandwidth of the second array antenna covers the bandwidth
(902928 MHz) of the UHF band RFID system in North America. It is therefore concluded that
the second PIFA array antenna is a promising antenna for achieving a broad bandwidth and high
gain in very low profile and metal platform use.
