Vref is the reference voltage employed to compare with Vout 
and yields a serial error (1 or 0) from a comparator. The 
serial_error is developed with the difference of buck converter 
output signal Vout and the reference voltage, Vref as shown in 
Fig. 3.

When Vout is greater than Vref, serial_error = 0, which 
decreases the duty cycle of duty(t) signal. By contrast, 
serial_error = 1 when Vout is less than Vref, and the duty cycle 
of duty(t) signal increases. 
The output of the serial_error signal is sent to the EPU which 
generates e[n] ranging from -4 to +4 [2]. e[n] is an error signal, 
which is the difference of Vout and Vref. Since the requirement 
for a high-resolution digital PWM is one of the important 
considerations in digitally controlled high-frequency power 
regulators [2], the compensated signal d[n] is ranging from 1 to 
255. Therefore, the digital PWM generates a 1MHz switching 
frequency duty(t) signal with a duty cycle d[n]/256. According 
to duty(t) and all internal parameters, the converter develops 
output voltage Vout on the load and the operation iterates until 
Vout is equal to Vref. 
 
A. EPU (Error Process Unit)  
The EPU is a state machine developing error signal e[n] 
according to serial_error signal. Fig.4 shows the EPU state 
diagram. If input serial_error is 1, then e[n]+1 and e[n] are not 
greater than +4. On the contrary, if serial_error is 0, then e[n]-1 
and e[n] are not less than -4. Obviously, it can be implemented 
with a 4-bit register to cover the range from -4 to +4. Table 1 
shows the truth table.

C. Multi-phase DPWM  
The multi-phase clock signals for the DPWM can be 
implemented with the data oversampling architecture proposed 
in [6]. The phase shift of each clk_1M[255:0] bus clock is 
π/128, which is approximately 3.9 ns for 1MHz clock 
frequency as shown in Fig.7. Fig.8 shows the block diagram of 
the multi-phase DPWM in which d[n]_bit[254:0] is the bus 
input signal.

The multi-phase clock source is generated from the VCO of a 
PLL. The n-bit resolution can be achieved using nm-phase clock 
signals [4] and the remaining nc-bit resolution is obtained from 
an nc-bit counter. Notice that here n = nm + nc. The multi-phase 
signals 1, 2, 3,… mn2 are generated with a PLL whose VCO is a 
differential ring-oscillator as shown in Fig. 9.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The system simulation has been performed with SIMULINK. 
Fig.10 shows the simulation model and the simulation 
condition is: the input Vg = 5 V, the output voltage is regulated 
at Vo=1.8V, R=3.6Ω, L=1μH, C=22μF. The parameters of the 
PID compensator are: a=12.5, b=-23.5, and c=11.5 and the sum 
of (11) can be calculated with the Euler’s method [5], which 
can be stored the pre-calculated values in an external memory. 
The sample time Ts is set to 1μs. Fig.11 shows the simulated 
power-up transient period waveform within 100μs.
