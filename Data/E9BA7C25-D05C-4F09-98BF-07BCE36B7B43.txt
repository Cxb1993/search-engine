英文摘要 
The global positioning system (GPS) and the future advent of European Navigation system Galileo can 
provide accurate positioning and timing information useful in many applications. The GPS/Galileo satellites 
broadcast ranging codes and navigation data with the technique of direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS). 
The Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation, different (and longer) codes, and pilot channels have been 
proposed in Galileo as a mean to reduce the mutual interference on common carriers, and also as a way to 
improve the expected performance.  
Although global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) inherently can cope with low power narrowband and 
wideband obstacles by its near 43-dB processing gain, it cannot cope with high power obstacles. The 
approaches of system performances that can be further enhanced by preprocessing to reject the intentional or 
unintentional jamming will be investigated in this project. The project deals with the design of the interference 
canceller for GNSS receiver. This project investigates the applicability of ANFA for interference suppressing 
and frequency estimation in GPS receivers. Since the characteristics of interference are always unknown or 
time-variant, the notch point of ANFA can be adjusted adaptively to cancel the narrowband component from 
its input waveforms. The variable convergence factor that minimizes the instantaneous error criterion is 
adopted in the modified adaptive Gaussian-Newton (MAGN) algorithm to enhance the convergence speed. 
The improved performances of the ANFA scheme are compared with that of the conventional normalized least 
mean square (NLMS) and recursive least squares (RLS) in terms of the SNR improvement and mean output 
power (MOP) under the diversity of stationary and time-varying jamming environments.

adaptive FIR, with fewer coefficients and lower computational costs. The minimal parameter constrained 
notch filter (CNF) [10] is proposed for elimination of multiple unknown sine waves imbedded in a broadband 
signal. However, the coefficients biased problem is still a challenge that needs to be overcome in CNF design. 
It has also been proved [11] that the adaptive all-pass based notch filter (ANFA) has a better unbiased 
property with its coefficients, both theoretically and experimentally. Through the various consumer and 
aerospace GPS applications, the adequate ANFA structure can be employed to converge instantaneously to the 
incident frequency and track the variation of interfering signals.

RECEIVED SIGNAL MODELS 
A simplified block diagram of the anti-jamming GPS model is shown in Figure 1(a). The transmitted spread 
spectrum signal is given by:   
  )cos()()()( 1ttCAtBtZ L             (1) 
where )(tB  represents the transmitted baseband navigation data, which is in binary form and has a duration 
T  ( =20msT ). ( )CA t  is the GPS course acquisition (C/A) code sequence with chip duration cT  
( 1/ 1.023

R T MHz  ), and 1L  represents primary GPS frequency (1575.42MHz). The integer 
/ 20460 43( )

PG T T dB    is the processing gain of the GPS system.  
The jamming signals may be intentional or unintentional. Intentional signals are always hostile. Friendly 
sources originate from RF transmitters, which are either nearby ground RF transmission stations or those on 
board aircraft. Four kinds of jamming signals are investigated:  
(1) Single tone CWI:      tAtJ Lscwi 1cos)(      (2.1) 
where A  denotes the amplitude and   is its frequency offset from the central frequency of the spread 
spectrum signal.   is a random phase uniformly distributed over the interval )2,0[  .

Your paper, "The UKF-based RNN Predictor for GPS Narrowband Interference 
Suppression",  
was accepted as part of the technical program for the 2012 Australian Communications  
Theory Workshop (AusCTW). 
 
 
發表的論文, 如下頁: 
The study of narrowband interference 
rejection has attracted considerable attention 
in recent years. Vijayan and Poor [3,4] 
proposed nonlinear methods of suppressing 
narrowband signals with a significant 
improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR). The approximate conditional mean 
(ACM) filter is applied to the narrowband 
interference, the statistics of which are 
known to the receivers. This approach 
produces better results than the linear 
Kalman filter. However, in practice, it is 
difficult to establish the AR model. 
Therefore, they also proposed a new 
enhanced nonlinear adaptive (ENA) 
algorithm [4,5] that does not need the AR 
parameters and can outperform the existing 
linear and nonlinear adaptive filters. 
Therefore, the ENA algorithm will be used 
as the basis of comparison in this project. 
The artificial neural network (ANN) is one 
of the alternative methods used to achieve 
narrowband interference suppression in DS-
SS [6~8]. The pipelined recurrent neural 
network, proposed by Haykin and Li [6], 
provides a better SNR improvement than the 
nonlinear ACM filter when the statistics and 
number of code division multiple access 
(CDMA) users are unknown to those 
receivers. Several algorithms have been 
proposed for training of the recurrent neural 
network (RNN). The most widely known is 
the real time recurrent learning (RTRL) 
algorithm, proposed by Williams and Zipser 
[9], which can be used to update the weights 
of the RNN in real time. However, RTRL 
suffers from a drawback, slow convergence, 
and can’t provide a good solution during the 
learning process. Since the interfering 
signals may not be stationary, a substitute 
model based on recurrent neural network 
(RNN) structure is more suitable for 
nonstationary signal prediction [10, 11]. 
In this paper, we study the performance of 
the UKF-based RNN predictors for 
stationary interference cancellation in GPS 
receivers. While converging to a better local 
minimum in fewer epochs than the RTRL 
algorithm, the global extended Kalman filter 
(GEKF) algorithm approach carries a heavy 
computational burden. Using the same 
derivative information as the RTRL 
algorithm, the NDEKF algorithm has only 
modest additional computational 
requirements for RNN and provides better 
convergence performance. Recently, Julier 
and Uhlmann [12-14] have introduced a new 
filter founded on the intuition that it is easier 
to approximate a Gaussian distribution than 
it is to approximate arbitrary nonlinear 
functions. They named this filter as 
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The UKF 
leads to more accurate results than EKF and 
in particular it generates much better 
estimates of the covariance of the state. 
Once the prediction of the jamming signal is 
obtained, an error signal can be computed by 
subtracting the estimate from the received 
signal. The error signal is then fed into the 
correlator for despreading. 
Received Signal Models 
GPS systems are continuously going 
through progressive evolution in the field of 
positioning and navigation. A receiver 
computes its position, velocity and time 
solution by processing received data from a 
constellation of satellites. Unfortunately, the 
low power GPS signal is susceptible to 
many types of interference, which can be 
either intentional or unintentional. This 
interference can degrade the quality of, or 
 )cos()(2    ckTJkj  
where J  is amplitude and  is its frequency 
offset from the center frequency of the 
spread spectrum signal. cT  is the chip 
duration, which is equal to the sampling 
interval.   is a random phase uniformly 
distributed over the interval )2,0[  . 
In Fig. 2, the narrowband canceller 
composed of an RNN predictor and an adder 
is employed to suppress the jamming signals. 
The { )(kS } and { )(kn } sequences are 
wideband signals with nearly flat spectra. 
Thus, these two sequences cannot be 
estimated from their past values. The 
interfering signal { )(kj } can be predicted 
because of its correlated property. The error 
signal )(kz  is obtained as 
 )()()(ˆ)()()()( knkSkjkjknkSkz   
)(kz  can be viewed as an almost 
interference-free signal and is fed into the 
correlator.

Proposed Recurrent Neural Network 
(RNN) Predictor 
The prediction of a time series is 
synonymous with modeling of physical 
systems responsible for its generation. 
However, the jamming signals always have 
statistically stationary/nonstationary 
properties, and one nonlinear structure 
suitable for estimation is the artificial neural 
network. RNNs are the most general type of 
neural networks. They have feedback, a 
property which makes them capable of 
learning on-line and adapting to statistical 
variation of incoming time series. RNNs 
have been proven [7] to be better than 
traditional signal processors in modeling and 
predicting nonlinear and chaotic time series, 
as well as in a wide variety of applications 
ranging from speech processing to adaptive 
channel equalization. 
RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK 
DYNAMICS 
The detailed structure of an RNN is 
illustrated in Fig. 3. It has a neural module 
and a comparator of its own. Specifically, 
the module consists of a fully connected 
RNN with N hidden neurons, P external 
input neurons, and one output neuron. In 
each neuron, one-unit delayed version 
outputs of hidden neurons are assumed to be 
fed back to the input. Besides the P+N 
inputs, one bias input whose value is always 
at +1 is included. Let matrix aW  denote the 
synaptic weights of the N neurons in the 
hidden layer that are connected to the 
feedback nodes in the input layer, and 
matrix bW  represent the synaptic weights of 
these hidden neurons that are connected to 
the input nodes. It is further assumed that 
the bias term of hidden neurons are absorbed 
in the weight matrix bW . The weight 
matrices aW  and bW  can be expressed as  
  TTaNTajTaa WWWW ......1  
  TTbNTbjTbb WWWW ......1  
    NjTba WWWWWW ......1  
can be modeled as the nonlinear discrete 
time state equations:   
 kkk uxx  1  
   kkk vxHy   
where kx  is an N(N+P+1)-by-1 vector 
obtained by rearranging the weight matrix 
)(kW  into a column vector, and ky  is an N-
by-1 observation vector. The first equation 
states that the state of the neural network is 
characteristized as a stationary process 
corrupted by process noise ku . The second 
equation, known as the observation equation, 
represents the desired response vector ky  as 
a nonlinear function of weight vector kx  and 
measurement noise kv . The N(N+P+1)-by-1 
process noise vector )(ku , which has the 
PDF ),0(~ 1Qu Nk , is independent from sample 
to sample, so that   0nTmuuE  for 
nm (vector WGN). kv  is an N-by-1 
observation noise vector with PDF 
),0(~ 2Qv Nk  and is independent from sample 
to sample; thus   0nTmvvE  for nm  (vector 
WGN).  
The unscented Kalman filter is a 
straightforward extension of the UT to the 
recursive estimation, where the state RV is 
redefined as the concatenation of the 
original state and noise variables: 
 TTkTkTkak nvxx  . The UT sigma point 
selection scheme is applied to this new 
augmented state RV to calculate the 
corresponding sigma matrix, akχ . The UKF 
equations are described follows. Note that 
no explicit calculations for Jacobians or 
Hessians matrices are necessary to 
implement this algorithm. Furthermore, the 
overall number is of the same order as the 
EKF. The UKF algorithm is represented as:

0.75dB over the LMS, RLS, ENA, RTRL 
and NDEKF methods, respectively. Figure 
4(b) shows that the UKF scheme is also 
superior in both convergence speed and 
prediction error. The MSPE can decline 
significantly to 410  in 250 iterations, while 
the other methods reach the steady state 
after 400 iterations and have larger MSPE 
results.  
The AR process signal is obtained by 
passing a white Gaussian noise through a 
second-order IIR filter with two poles at 
9.0z . In Fig. 5(a), we plot the SNR 
improvement curves of all the predictors 
under the AR interference conditions. It can 
be seen the adaptive nonlinear filtering 
techniques offer considerable advantages 
over conventional linear filters. The 
performance of linear filters, i.e. LMS and 
RLS, is never as good as that of nonlinear 
filters. On average, the UKF SNR 
improvements are 0.65dB, 3.93dB, 6.92dB, 
9.72dB and 10.05dB higher than those of 
the NDEKF, RTRL, ENA, RLS, and LMS 
methods, respectively. In Fig. 5(a) we 
compare the performance of the UKF 
algorithm with others by plotting the value 
of the MSPE versus the number of iterations. 
As we can see after about 400 iterations, the 
UKF has a better convergence rate than the 
LMS, RLS, ENA, and RTRL algorithms and 
exhibits a level of performance close to that 
of the NDEKF algorithm.
