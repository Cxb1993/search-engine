I. INTRODUCTION
The third generation partnership project (3GPP)
has been studying and specifying an evolved packet
system (EPS) [1]. As shown in Fig. 1, the EPS
integrates 3GPP and non-3GPP wireless access
networks to provide mobile users with ubiquitous
access to a diverse set of multimedia services.
The 3GPP access networks include global system
for mobile communications (GSM)-enhanced data
rates for GSM evolution (GSM-EDGE) radio access
network (GERAN), universal mobile telecommuni-
cations system (UMTS) terrestrial radio access net-
work (UTRAN), and evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN)
[2]. The non-3GPP access networks include wireless
local area network (WLAN) and worldwide interop-
erability for microwave access (WiMAX).
In the EPS, the packet data network (PDN)
gateway provides connections and access to the
operator’s multimedia services. All user-plane data
paths from 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks
are combined at the PDN gateway. Additionally,
the PDN gateway acts as the user plane anchor
for mobility between 3GPP and non-3GPP access
networks. In 3GPP access networks, the serving
gateway acts as the mobility anchor and provides
connections to the PDN gateway. The serving gate-
way is also responsible for packet routing and for-
warding between the legacy serving general packet
radio service (GPRS) support node (SGSN) and the
PDN gateway. In non-3GPP access networks, the
access gateway provides connections to the PDN
gateway. For un-trusted non-3GPP access networks,
such as legacy WLANs with no strong built-in
security features, the access gateway should provide
extra security functionality.
In addition to the above-mentioned gateways han-
dling user data traffic, the EPS also contains a
core control element, called policy and charging
rules function (PCRF), for supporting service-based
policy and charging control (PCC) functions. Fig. 2
shows the PCC architecture [3] that implements
the PCC functions. The PCC functionality is com-
prised by the functions of the application function
(AF), the subscription profile repository (SPR), the
PCRF, the policy and charging enforcement function
(PCEF), the bearer binding and event reporting
function (BBERF), and the charging system (CS).

The AF is an element offering applications that
require dynamic policy and/or charging control.
One example of an AF is the proxy-call state
control function (P-CSCF) of the IP multimedia
subsystem (IMS) [4]. The SPR contains all sub-
scriber/subscription related information (e.g., al-
lowed services, charging related information, etc.).
The PCRF determines the acceptance of the service
request from the AF based on the operator-defined
service policies, the resource availability, the service
information received from the AF, the subscription
information stored in the SPR, and the access-
specific information provided by the PCEF and/or
the BBERF.
If the AF request is accepted, the PCRF shall
decide how the accepted service request shall be
treated in the PCEF and the BBERF. After mak-
ing policy decisions, the PCRF sends the traf-
1
scheduling functionality at the PCRF. It also helps
maintain service ordering. Although maintaining
service ordering is not a requirement at the PCRF,
failure to do so may have a serious impact on user
satisfaction.
Price directly affects the user selection of access
networks, and consequently, the load of access net-
works. To achieve load balancing between 3GPP
and non-3GPP access networks, we use an eco-
nomic model to regulate the demand for a certain
network access service. We assume that the traffic
demand Dk for a certain service class k (k = 1, 2)
depends only on its price Pk, and it can be described
by a demand function proposed in [6]:
Dk = AkPk
−Ek (1)
where Ak and Ek are the scaling factor and the
price elasticity for service class k, respectively. The
scaling factor Ak is equal to the value of Dk when
Pk = 1, so that Ak can be interpreted as the
demand potential for service class k. The greater the
demand potential Ak, the higher the traffic demand
for service class k we can have in the system. The
price elasticity Ek, which is defined as the negative
ratio of the relative change in demand for service
class k and the relative change in its price, indicates
the sensitivity of user demand for service class k to
change in price. We consider that the value of Ek
is positive, that is, the service demand increases as
the price decreases. If Ek is large, the traffic demand
for service class k is more sensitive to the change
in price.
By dynamically adjusting the prices of 3GPP and
non-3GPP access services based on their demand
potential and price elasticity, we can achieve load
balancing. In order to maximize revenue generation,
we thus need to determine the optimal price for
each access service based on its demand function
as defined in (1). To determine the optimal prices
for multiple access services in the EPS, we define
the system revenue R that is the expected profit
obtained by serving a service request. The system
revenue R can be expressed as
R = (P1γ1 + P2γ2) (1− PB) (2)
where PB is the probability of blocking a service
request and γk is the normalized traffic demand for
service class k. The calculation of PB is given in
Section III. Using (1), γk can be expressed as
γk =
Dk
D1 +D2
. (3)
For fixed total traffic arrival rate to the PCRF, by
varying the values of P1 and P2, we can regulate
the demand for 3GPP and non-3GPP access ser-
vices (i.e., γk) to improve resource utilization, and
still maximize revenue generation. Since the system
revenue R is a linear function with respect to P1
and P2, we are only interested in the ratio between
these two prices. Denote the price ratio between
class 1 and class 2 as Pr = P2P1 . The goal of the
access-aware pricing strategy is then to determine
the optimal value of Pr, denoted as P or , to maximize
the system revenue R. The method for determining
P or will be elaborated in Section IV.
III. SIMULATION MODEL
We developed an event-driven simulation in C
language to study the performance of the PCRF
using the proposed access-aware pricing strategy in
terms of the request blocking probability PB and the
system revenue R. We assume that the arrivals of
service requests to the PCRF are Poisson distributed
with an aggregate arrival rate λ. This assumption
is commonly used in the evaluation of Internet
servers [7]–[11]. Besides, as indicated in [12], this
assumption is expected to be accurate if the requests
are created by a large population of independent
users as it would be the case if the AF is the P-
CSCF in a 3GPP IMS system. Also, as proved in
[13], the arrival process of class-k service requests
can be modeled as a Poisson process with a rate of
λk = λγk where γk is given in (3). The service
times of class-k service requests are assumed to
have exponential distribution with a mean of 1
µk
, as
in [14]–[16]. For convenience, we denote non-3GPP
and 3GPP access services as class-1 and class-2
services, respectively.
For each service class k (k = 1, 2), there are two
types of events in the simulation: the arrival event
Ea(k) for the arrival of service requests and the
completion event Ec(k) for the service completion
of service requests. The events are inserted into a
system event list and processed in a non-decreasing
order of their occurrence times. A simulation clock

until its size falls below a predefined threshold,
which decides the resolution of the optimization.
The optimal price ratio P or is determined as the
center value of the resulting feasible range.
Fig. 4 shows the iterative method for determining
P or . The method first initializes the step size α, the
resolution parameter β, and the initial lower bound
of the price ratio P 1r . With α and P 1r , the method
finds two price ratios: P 2r and P 3r . Using (2), it
then computes the system revenues at P 2r and P 3r ,
denoted as R2 and R3, respectively. If R3 > R2,
we set P 1r = P
2
r , P

r = P

r , and P 3r = P 3r + α, and
calculate the system revenues at P 2r and P 3r . The
control then moves back to check if R3 > R2. If
not (i.e., R3 < R2), it means that we have found
the feasible range of P or . We then check to see if
P 3r − P 1r < β (i.e., the size of the feasible range
is less than the threshold). If so, the method stops
with an optimal price ratio P or =
P 1r+P

. With the updated
α, we set P 2r = P
1
r + α and P 3r = P 2r + α, and
compute the system revenues at P 2r and P 3r . Again,
the control moves back to check if R3 > R2.
We now give a brief description of the iterative
method using an example. Fig. 5(a) shows the
system revenues at P 1r , P 2r , and P 3r . In Fig. 5(b), we
update P 1r = P 2r , P 2r = P 3r , and P 3r = P 3r +α. From
Fig. 5(b), it is observed that R3 < R2. This means
that we have found the feasible range. We then set
α = P

r−P 1r

. In Fig. 5(c), we update P 2r = P 1r + α
and P 3r = P 2r + α. We iteratively update P 1r = P 2r ,

r , and P 3r = P 3r + α until R3 < R2. From
Fig. 5(d), it is observed that R3 < R2. At this time,
we get the next iteration with smaller feasible range.
This process iterates until P 3r − P 1r < β, and then
outputs the optimal price ratio P or .
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we conduct a detailed study to
provide insight into the impact of varying various
parameters on the system revenue and the optimal
price ratio. These parameters include the demand
potential and the price elasticity of class-1 and
class-2 services. Here, we consider the demand
potential ratio of class-2 service to class-1 service
Ar = A2/A1 and the price elasticity ratio of class-2
service to class-1 service Er = E2/E1 since we
are interested in proportions rather than absolute
values. This section also investigates the effect of
varying Ar and Er on the optimal price ratio P or .
For all results presented here, we set the aggregate
arrival rate λ = 1.0 and the price of class-1 service
P1 = 1.0 for simplicity. Besides, we assume that
the average service times for class-1 and class-2
service requests are 1/μ1 = 1.0 and 1/μ2 = 2.0,
respectively, and the buffer size b = 10. We also
5
becomes increasingly significant. For example, with
Ar = 0.1, P
o
r is decreased from 2.9 at Er = 2 to
1.5 at Er = 10 (the difference is 1.4), whereas with
Ar = 10, P
o
r is decreased from 6.4 at Er = 2 to
1.7 at Er = 10 (the difference is 4.7). As for R∗,
when Ar = 0.1, R∗ is decreased from 0.933146 at
Er = 2 to 0.917025 at Er = 10 (the difference is
0.016121), while with Ar = 10, R∗ is decreased
from 1.675934 at Er = 2 to 0.925869 at Er = 10
(the difference is 0.750065). This result reveals that
the optimal price setting and the maximal system
revenue obtained are highly affected by the price
elasticity ratio Er, particularly when the Ar value
is large (i.e., the demand potential for class-2 service
is high).
One more observation from Fig. 6 is that in-
creasing the value of Ar moves the crossing point
between curves to the right (i.e., toward higher price
ratios). This phenomenon is because the maximum
tolerated price that a user is willing to pay for using
class-2 service increases as the demand potential
of class-2 service increases (i.e., Ar increases),
resulting in the associated increase in the price ratio.
VI. CONCLUSION
This project proposed an access-aware pric-
ing strategy for the EPS supporting 3GPP and
non-3GPP wireless access services. The proposed
access-aware pricing strategy is able to achieve load
balancing between 3GPP and non-3GPP access net-
works, and, most importantly, to maximize revenue
generation in the EPS, by dynamically adjusting
the prices of 3GPP and non-3GPP access services
based on their demand potential and price elastic-
ity. In addition, this project proposed an iterative
method to determine the optimal price ratio between
3GPP and non-3GPP access services to maximize
the system revenue. This project also studied the
effect of varying the demand potential ratio and the
price elasticity ratio between 3GPP and non-3GPP
access services on the optimal price ratio and the
maximal system revenue obtained. According to the
numerical results, we observed the following.
• The optimal price ratio and the maximal system
revenue obtained decrease as the price elastic-
ity ratio increases, and increase as the demand
potential ratio increases.
• As the demand potential ratio increases, the
effect of the price elasticity ratio on the optimal
price ratio and the maximal system revenue
obtained becomes increasingly significant.
• When the price elasticity ratio is small, the
demand potential ratio dominates the optimal
price setting and the maximal system revenue
obtained; but when the value of the price elas-
ticity ratio becomes larger, the price elasticity
ratio begins to dominate.
