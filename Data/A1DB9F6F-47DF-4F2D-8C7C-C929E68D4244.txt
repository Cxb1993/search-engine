I. Abstract 
Operating automatic machine, precise 
flow control valve or other components are 
called for to operate with positioning 
controller while pneumatic system controls 
position. For practical purposes, however, 
uses of pneumatic system are limited because 
of expensive imported positioning controllers, 
such as German FESTO flow control valve. 
Therefore, this project aims at design a low 
cost position controller of pneumatic system. 
Through experiment, a less expensive and 
accessible practice of precise pneumatic 
positioning control has succeeded in 
controlling position by precision of 0.2 mm, 
which makes the research valuable in 
practical propose.      
To practice precise pneumatic actuator 
and positioning controller, the research takes 
proportional integral controller and variable 
structure controller with DSP control units 
system; it can precisely control position. 
Moreover, the easy-to-get, low-priced units 
could make enterprise more competitive by 
reducing manufacturing cost, which is one of 
the main ideas of this project.

II. Introduction 
Pneumatic actuators have the following 
advantages for positioning applications: 1) 
low cost; 2) high power-to-weight ratio; 3) 
ease of maintenance; 4) cleanliness; 5) a 
readily available and cheap power source; 6) 
high speed. Particularly well-suited 
applications for pneumatic actuators are the 
position control of robotic manipulators, end 
effectors, where stiff and lightweight 
structures are critical. Unfortunately, 
pneumatic actuators are subject to high 
friction forces, dead band (due to stiction), 
and dead time (due to the compressibility of 
                                                                 NSC-95-2221-E-212-019 ????

in sliding mode control, the states remain on 
the sliding surface, the motion of the piston is 
very smooth [13] - [15]. Paul et. al.[2] use 
the sliding mode theory to implement a 
nonlinear, time-varying plant such as a 
pneumatic cylinder. Zak and Hui [16] 
propose a static output feedback method. 
Some important conditions were given on 
switching surface design. In John et. al. [17], 
a nonlinear mathematical model is derived for 
the system and a sliding mode controller is 
designed to give elbow angle tracking to 
within a guaranteed accuracy despite 
modeling errors. Chern et. al. [18]. An 
electro-hydraulic velocity servo-control 
system using the proposed IVSC approach is 
illustrated. Bouri et. al. [19] proposed a 
synthesis of a nonlinear switching control to a 
rotational electro-pneumatic servo-drive using 
a sliding mode approach. A nonlinear sliding 
mode control law is applied to the system 
under consideration.

1. Introduction 
Pneumatic actuators have the following advantages 
for positioning applications: 1) low cost; 2) high 
power-to-weight ratio; 3) ease of maintenance; 4) 
cleanliness; 5) a readily available and cheap power 
source; 6) high speed. Particularly well-suited 
applications for pneumatic actuators are the position 
control of robotic manipulators, end effectors, where stiff 
and lightweight structures are critical. Unfortunately, 
pneumatic actuators are subject to high friction forces, 
dead band (due to stiction), and dead time (due to the 
compressibility of air). These nonlinearities make 
accurate position control of a pneumatic actuator difficult 
to achieve. As a result, a considerable amount of research 
work has been devoted to the development of various 
position-control systems for pneumatic actuators. Many 
of these systems, though successful, use expensive 
proportional servo valves and pressure sensor feedback 
loops. The objective of this work is to implement 
inexpensive on/off solenoid valves, rather than servo 
valves, to develop a fast, accurate, and inexpensive 
pneumatic actuator system [1]. A typical pneumatic 
servo valve may cost approximately NTD16000, whereas 
a typical solenoid valve costs only NTD2000, 
representing a 8:1 reduction in valve costs. Use of pulse 
width modulated signals across the power devices made 
it possible for servo systems to eliminate control 
problems, such as dead band and stiction. The pulse 
width modulated ON-OFF valves to replace costlier 
servo valves and also improve the system performance.                                                    
Seeing that the pneumatic actuator control system 
used of the industry, generally only make simple 
ON-OFF return circuit to control, it is less likely to 
utilize the pneumatic actuators system to do further 
accurate position control. So we design a new-type of 
flow control valve to make a position control structure. 
In addition, we have studied various kinds of to control 
the pneumatic actuators accurately. In closed- loop 
control circuit under the load change of pneumatic 
actuators, the experiment comes to and direct against 
different change load. The performance used between 
more different load situations and different control 
methods behaves. The work explores using of the sliding 
mode theory by implementing it on a nonlinear, 
time-varying plant such as a pneumatic cylinder. Due to 
the robustness property of the controller, the movement 
of the states is smooth. Moreover, since the  sliding mode 
controller offers flexible gain selection procedure based 
on the sliding surface condition  
 
s s& < 0 
 
 We can see that the dynamic model of plant can be 
simplified to a great extent [2]. In early days, the 
research of the pneumatic system has been proposed [3, 
4] but be limited the software and hardware, so to control 
a linear mathematics model. And the design of the 
controller is by traditional control theory. As the 
operation speed of the computer is increasing constantly, 
the scholar begins to use the microcomputer to control 
pneumatic system. Weston et. al. in 1984 [5] used the 
feedback of compensating to design the controller, but 
they had not considered the influence of disturbances to 
the system. Leonhardt et. al. [6] demonstrated that the 
cylinder pressure signal can successfully be used for this 
task. Pandian et. al. [7] considers the problem of design 
of observers to estimate the chamber pressure variables 
in a cylinder actuator. Wang et. al.[8] implementation of 
on- line learning neural network controller in the 
pneumatic robot position servo control. Kazeroon [9] 
develops a control algorithm to convert pneumatic 
actuators into force generators. Kim et. al. [10] presents 
a structural design method of robust motion controllers
