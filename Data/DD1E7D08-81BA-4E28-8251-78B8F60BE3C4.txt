The crystalline phases of Mg4Ta2O9 film were 
identified by XRD (Rigaku D/Max Ⅲ.Ⅴ) at 30 kV and 
20 mA using Cu Kα radiation. The morphology of the 
film surface was determined using an atomic force 
microscope (AFM, Digital Instruments DI3100) and by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
The electrical characteristics of the Mg4Ta2O9 thin 
films were evaluated by current–voltage (I–V) and 
capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements. The test 
samples with metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor 
structures were prepared on Pt/SiO2/Si(100) substrates. 
The sample devices (Pt/Mg4Ta2O9/Pt/SiO2/Si(100), Fig. 
1) were fabricated by symmetrically depositing Pt 
electrodes on double sides of Mg4Ta2O9 films. All 
electrodes were prepared by using ion sputtering. The 
I–V and C–V characteristics of the MIM capacitors were 
measured by a HP4156 parameter analyzer and a 
HP4192 impedance analyzer, respectively.

3. Results and discussion 
The XRD patterns of Mg4Ta2O9 thin films 
deposited on Pt/SiO2/Si(100) substrates with various O2 
contents of the sputtering gas at 300 W are shown in Fig. 
2. The results indicate that the Mg4Ta2O9 (100), (102), 
(104), (006), (200), and (116) peaks were enhanced 
gradually with decreasing O2 concentration. As the O2 
partial pressure was decreased to 0% (Ar/O2 = 100/0), 
the intensities of the Mg4Ta2O9 peaks (104) and (116) 
were relatively higher than the others due to preferred 
growth of these grains. Moreover, the full width at half 
maximum intensity values (FWHM) of the Mg4Ta2O9 
(104) and (116) peaks decreased with decreasing O2 
partial pressure. It indicates that finer crystal grains are 
presented in Mg4Ta2O9 films in higher oxygen 
concentration. This implies that the Ar/O2 ration is also 
an important indicator of the optimum condition for 
depositing Mg4Ta2O9 thin films.

a RF power of 300 W and various Ar/O2 ratios: (a) 100/0, 
(b) 90/10, and (c) 80/20. 
 
The SEM photographs of Mg4Ta2O9 films sputtered 
at various O2 contents are shown in Fig. 3. The SEM 
showed that the grain size increased with increasing Ar 
partial pressure; other work has revealed a similar trend 
[14]. The properties of Mg4Ta2O9 thin films were found 
to depend strongly on certain parameters, including 
Ar/O2 ratios and annealing treatments. From the XRD 
pattern of Mg4Ta2O9 thin films, the peak of highly 
oriented Mg4Ta2O9 (104) was obtained. The reason for 
the orientation is determined by surface energy 
considerations. The surface energy of a crystal plane can 
be approximately estimated [15].

surface energy is less than the value of the other crystal

Fig. 8(a) shows that the dielectric constant 
decreased as oxygen partial increases further. Many 
factors influence the dielectric constant of Mg4Ta2O9 
films such as composition, crystallinity enhances the 
polarization of electric dipoles in a single grain, but a 
small grain size tends to depress the dielectric constant, 
as reported in previous work [17, 18]. Hence, the 
dielectric constant is inferred to increase as the 
crystallinity improves and grain size effect dominates 
and the dielectric constant decreases as oxygen partial 
pressure increases. In addition, the dielectric constant of 
the Mg4Ta2O9 films as a function of annealing 
temperature and annealing time is demonstrated in Figs. 
8(b) and 8(c). With annealing temperature of 550 °C and 
annealing time of 1 h, a dielectric constant of 13.66 was 
obtained.

4. Conclusion 
Preferentially (104)-oriented Mg4Ta2O9 thin films 
were successfully prepared by RF magnetron sputtering 
on Pt/SiO2/Si(100) substrate at a temperature much 
lower than the bulk sintering temperatures. Mg4Ta2O9 
was found to be well crystallized. The quality of the 
Mg4Ta2O9 film was found to depend strongly on the O2 
concentration, the annealing temperature, and annealing 
time. The dielectric constants of the annealing 
temperature films decreased with increasing O2 content 
of the sputtering gas. In addition, the annealing 
improved the dielectric properties of the films. This is 
attributed to an increase in grain size, confirmed from 
AFM images. The annealing films showed lower 
leakage currents than the as deposited film. From the 
AFM images, it can be verified that the leakage current 
characteristics of the Mg4Ta2O9 films are strongly 
related to the surface roughness of the films. The 
optimum conditions for the growth of Mg4Ta2O9 thin 
films in this study were an annealing temperature of 550 
°C for 1 h and an Ar/O2 ratio of 100/0. A high dielectric 
constant of 13.66 (f = 10 MHz) and a low leakage 
current of 2.45 × 10-8 A/cm2 were obtained for the 
prepared films. All the characteristics of the prepared 
Mg4Ta2O9 thin film show that they are suitable for use in 
chip capacitors and integrated circuit applications.
