solved by using the image technique and Fourier transform by Fan and Wang [18]. In 
2006, Fang and Liu [19] extended the complex-variable function and 
Riemann-Schwarz’s symmetry principle to solve the problem of the interaction of a 
screw dislocation with a circular nano-inhomogeneity incorporating interface stress. 
Almost all the above problems were solved by using the complex-variable technique. 
Its extension to three-dimensional cases may be limited. A more general approach is 
nontrivial for further investigation. 
Analytical as well as numerical Green’s functions have received many BEM 
researchers’ attention [6]. Boundary element method was employed to solve 
time-harmonic Green’s functions [20, 21, 22]. Also, dynamic Eshelby problems [23, 
24, 25], piezoelectricity problems [26, 27] and scattering problems in elastodynamics 
[28, 29, 30] were solved. Although a lot of papers on the homogeneous case were 
published, only a few of the time-harmonic dynamic Green’s functions of several 
circular cylindrical inclusions can be found [31, 32]. Recently, Wang and Sudak [33] 
derived an analytical solution for anti-plane time-harmonic Green’s functions of 
acircular inhomogeneity with an imperfect interface. The interface between the 
inclusion and the matrix is modeled to linear springs with vanishing thickness. The 
boundary conditions of the interface are traction equilibrium but the displacement 
across interface is discontinuous. In addition, the stress response is proportional to the 
linear springs with vanishing thickness. The key concept of Wang and Sudak’s 
method is that they introduced the Trefftz bases for the solution representation of 
inclusion and matrix, respectively. However, the completeness of Trefftz bases needs 
special care. 
The boundary element method (BEM) or boundary integral equation methods 
(BIEMs) are well-known approaches and have been used to solve radiation and 
scattering problems as well as interior acoustics for many years. The importance of 
the integral equation in the solution, both theoretical and practical, for certain types of 
boundary value problems is universally recognized. One of the problems frequently 
addressed in BIEM/BEM is the problem of irregular frequencies in the boundary 
integral formulations for exterior acoustics and water wave problems. These 
frequencies do not represent any kind of physical resonance but are due to the 
numerical method, which has non-uniqueness solutions at characteristic frequencies 
associated with the eigenfrequency of the interior problem. Burton and Miller 
approach [34] as well as CHIEF technique [35] have been employed to deal with 
these problems. 
Regarding the irregular frequency, a large amount of papers on acoustics have 
been published. For example, numerical examples for non-uniform radiation and 
scattering problems by using the dual BEM were provided and the irregular 
 - 2 -
with emphasis on spurious eigenvalues when using the BIEM for 3D problems with 
inner holes. Spurious and fictitious solutions stem from non-uniqueness solution 
problems which appear in different aspects in computational mechanics. First of all, 
hourglass modes in the finite element method (FEM) using the reduced integration 
occur due to rank deficiency [44]. Also, loss of divergence-free constraint for the 
incompressible elasticity results in spurious modes. On the other hand, while solving 
the differential equation by using the finite difference method (FDM), the spurious 
eigenvalue also appears due to discretization [45-47]. In the real-part BEM [48] or the 
MRM formulation [49-54], spurious eigensolutions occur in solving eigenproblems. 
Even though the complex-valued kernel is adopted, the spurious eigensolution also 
occurs for the multiply-connected problem [55, 56] as well as the appearance of 
fictitious frequency for the exterior acoustics [57]. Spurious eigenvalues in the MFS 
for 3D problems were also studied by Tsai et al. [58]. In this project, a simple case of 
3D concentric sphere will be demonstrated to see how spurious eigensolutions occur 
and how they are suppressed by using SVD. In the recent years, the SVD technique 
has been applied to solve problems of fictitious-frequency [57] and continuum 
mechanics [59]. Two ideas, namely updating term and updating document [57], were 
successfully applied to extract the true and spurious solutions, respectively.  
NTOU/MSV group has used the null-field integral equation formulation in 
conjunction with the degenerate kernel and Fourier series to deal with many 
engineering problems with circular boundaries, such as torsion bar [60], water wave 
[61], Stokes flow [62], plate vibrations [63] and piezoelectricity problems [64]. They 
claimed that the approach has high accuracy and is one kind of semi-analytical 
approach. However, our previous applications only focused on two-dimensional 
circular problems. In this project, we will extend this idea to elliptical boundary and 
three-dimensional problems. 
In the first-year project, we focused on the image method and the null-field 
integral equation approach using the Green’s third identity and the superposition 
technique to determine the Green’s function for Laplace problems with circular holes 
and/or inclusions and a semi-circular inclusion. All the results by using the present 
approaches are compared with the solutions obtained from the literatures. In addition, 
the final image point is the focus of bipolar coordinates is examined. For second-year 
project, we employ the null field BIE in conjunction with the superposition technique 
to derive the Green’s functions or to solve BVPs for Laplace and Helmholtz problems 
with elliptical boundaries. In the elliptical coordinates, we expanded the fundamental 
solution to the degenerate kernel. Also, the boundary densities were expanded by 
eigenfunction expansion. Not only Laplace problems but also Helmholtz problems are 
considered. In the last-year project, the null-field integral equation method in

2.2 Null-field integral approach for boundary value problems 
For simplicity, a simple case of Laplacian operator is given here.

    Based on the dual boundary integral formulation for the domain point we have

where s and x are the source and field points, respectively,  is the potential at 
the field point, B is the boundary, nx and ns denote the outward normal vector at the 
field point x and the source point s and the kernel function U(s,x) is the fundamental 
solution which satisfies

By moving the field point x to the boundary, the dual boundary integral equations for 
the boundary point can be obtained as follows:

where R.P.V. is the Riemann principal value, C.P.V. is the Cauchy principal value and 
H.P.V. is the Hadamard (or called Mangler) principal value. When the field point x is 
moved to the complementary domain,the dual null-field integral equations are

where  is the distance between the source point s and the field point x and i 
is the imaginary number with  and  is the zeroth order Hankel function 
of the first kind. To fully utilize the property of circular geometry, the mathematical 
tools, degenerate (separable or finite rank) kernel and Fourier series, are utilized for 
the analytical calculation of boundary integrals.

2.2.3.1 Degenerate (separable) kernel for fundamental solutions 
Now, we adopt the mathematical tools, degenerate kernels and Fourier series, for 
the purpose of analytical study. The combination of degenerate kernels and Fourier 
series plays the important role in handling problems with circular boundaries. Instead 
of directly calculating R.P.V., C.P.V. and H.P.V. in Eqs. (10) and (11), we obtain the 
linear algebraic system from the null-field integral equations of Eqs. (16) and (17) or 
(20) and (21) through the kernel expansion by “exactly” collocating the point on the 
real boundary. Based on the separable property, the kernel function  can be 
expanded into the separable form by dividing the source and field points:

where the superscripts “i” and “e” denote the interior and exterior cases, respectively. 
The other kernels in the boundary integral equation can be obtained by utilizing the 
operators of Eqs. (7)-(9) with respect to the kernel . When the degenerate 
kernel was used, we shall assume that each of the sets {Aj} and {Bj} is linearly 
independent. In the computation, the degenerate kernel can be expressed as finite 
sums of products of functions of s alone by functions of x alone. The degenerate 
kernels for Laplace and Helmholtz problems are summarized in Appendix.

2.2.6 Linear algebraic system 
In order to calculate the Fourier coefficients, N (N=2M+1) boundary nodes for 
each circular boundary are located uniformly on each circular boundary. From Eqs. 
(16) and (17) or Eqs. (20) and (21), we have

It is noted that the integration path is clockwise. For the integral of the circular 
boundary Bi, the kernels (U(s,x), T(s,x), L(s,x) and M(s,x)) are expressed by using the 
degenerate kernel and setting the origin at the center of Bi. The boundary densities 
( )  and (su

(16) or (20), a linear algebraic system yields 
     uTtU  , (30)
where [U] and [T] are the influence matrices with a dimension of

unknown coefficients can be solved by using the linear algebraic equation. Then the 
unknown boundary data can be determined and the potential is obtained by 
substituting the boundary data into Eq. (16) or (20).

where B1 and B2 are the inner and outer boundaries, respectively. We extend a circular 
case [5] to an annular case. An annular case can be seen as a combination of interior

exterior Green’s functions can satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions

results in the nonhomogeneous boundary conditions on the outer boundary, we need 
to introduce an extra image point 3 . Similarly, 1  results in the nonhomogeneous

Similarly, the image method can be used for the problem of non-concentric

points for the non-concentric spheres is shown in Fig. 13, it is found that the final two

2.3.3.2 Geometric characterization of the bispherical coordinates

and radius of the hole is (0, 0) and a=1. The d/2=1.25 is the distance from the center 
to the ground line. Similarly, the analytical and semi-analytical solutions are obtained 
by using the bipolar coordinates and the image method, respectively. The results agree 
well with those of the null-field BIEM [71] in Fig. 19. 
 
3.1.3 A half plane with an apertue subject to the Dirichlet boundary condition 
Following the success of the eccentric annulus case for the iterative images, we 
now extend to the infinite plane with two circular holes as shown in Table 1. The 
problem sketch of the infinite plane with two circular holes is shown in Fig. 17(c). 
The source point is located at s=(3.85, 0). The centers of two holes are set at (0, 0) and 
(2.1, 0), their radii are 0.4 and 1.0, respectively. In a similar way of finding the image 
for matching boundary conditions [66], an image solution is derived. We also found 
that the final frozen image points approach to the focuses of the bipolar coordinates. 
Based on the image solution for an infinite plane with a circular hole subject to the 
Neumann BC, an extra source at the center of hole is required. This motivates us to 
put sources at two centers of the holes to obtain acceptable results. Therefore, Eq. (44) 
is extended to

In this case, a Green’s function for non-concentric spheres and its location of the 
concentrated source is at the z axis as shown in Fig. 12. The distance from the center

ellipse in the z plane is mapped into the unit circle 0R  in the   plane by using 
the conformal mapping. Now, the problem is revisited by using the present approach. 
Here, we consider the Neumann boundary condition ( 0

n
w ) on the hole first. The 
problem is decomposed into two parts, one is the remote shear in an infinite plane and 
another is the infinite plane problem with an elliptic hole, as shown in Figures 26(a) 
and 26(b), respectively. Figure 27(a) is the contour plot by using the Smith’s solution 
and considered 0x  and 1y  after rotating 90 degrees in clockwise way. 
Figure 27(b) shows the contour plot for case of 1x  and 0y  by using the 
present approach. After comparing the two figures, it is observed that our result 
matches well with Smith’s solution. Another rigid inclusion case (Dirichlet-type 
boundary condition) is also utilized to verify the validity of the present approach. 
Similarly, Figure 28(a) shows the contour plot by using Smith’s solution and 
considered 0x  and 1y  after rotating 90 degrees in clockwise way. Figure 
28(b) shows the contour plot for case of 1x  and 0y  by using the present 
approach. Good agreement is made. 
 
3.2.3 An elliptic membrane 
In the following cases, we consider an elliptic membrane subject to the Dirichlet 
or Neumann boundary conditions as shown in Figure 29. The half lengths of major 
and eccentricity are  and 1a 75.0e , respectively. The eigensolutions are 
obtained by using the present approach and compared to those calculated by the BEM 
and FEM (ABAQUS) for validations. Numerical results using the BEM and FEM 
match well with the true and spurious eigenvalues predicted theoretically, the results 
are shown in Table 3 and Table 4. 
 
3.2.4 An elliptic cylinder impinging by water waves 
In this case, the water wave problem containing an elliptic cylinder is considered. 
The half lengths of major and minor axes are 1a  and 5.0b , respectively and 
the water depth is . Figures 30(a) and 30(b) show the resultant force in the 
horizontal direction for an incident angle  by using the singular and

3.3 Null-field integral equation approach for 3-D problems 
3.3.1 A sphere pulsating with uniform radial velocity or oscillating with 
non-uniform radial velocity 
In the first case, we concerned with the two situations of a sphere. One is the 
sphere pulsating with uniform radial velocity and another is the sphere oscillating 
with non-uniform radial velocity. When a sphere is pulsating with uniform radial 
velocity U0, the exact solution of the problem can be found in [76] as shown below:

in which   is the angular frequency and k is the wave number that equals to the 
angular frequency over sound velocity. After expanding the surface density by using 
spherical harmonics, we have

After substituting Eq.(86) into Eq.(85), the result of our approach looks neater and 
yields the same exact solution of Eq.(81). For the numerical implementation, M is 
chosen to be six and twenty-eight nodes are distributed on the spherical surface as 
shown in Figure 32. Figures 33(a) and 33(b) show the real and imaginary parts of 
non-dimensional pressure on the surface by using the numerical procedure. In Figures 
33(a) and 33(b), irregular frequency does not appear due to the analytical cancellation 
of zero divided by zero in our formulation. However, Seybert et al. [76] needed to 
improve their result by using the CHIEF method. For this point, we can claim that our 
approach is more accurate than that of Seybert et al [76].

In the Example 1, it is found that the analytical solution for the simple case (one 
sphere) can be derived by using our approach. For more than two spheres case, the 
boundary density representation is truncated to a finite number of terms. The 
collocation points are located on the real boundary to match boundary conditions and 
the unknown spherical harmonics coefficients can be easily determined. Since the 
error is attributed from the truncated finite number of terms of spherical harmonics 
coefficients, our approach can be seen as one kind of semi-analytical methods. 
 
3.3.3 Acoustic scattering by a sphere 
In this case, the scattering problem of a sphere subject to an incident plane wave 
[79] is considered. Not only hard cylinder (Neumann type) but also soft cylinder 
(Dirichlet type) is considered. The plane wave incidence is given as

A concentric case with radii a and b ( 5.0a  and 0.1b ) is shown in Fig. 46. 
The analytical solution can be obtained by using the null-filed integral formulation, 
degenerate kernel and spherical harmonics. The common drop locations in Figs. 47(a) 
and 47(b) indicate the true eigenvalues. We employ the SVD updating term  to 
extract the true eigenvalues for the Dirichlet problem as shown in Fig. 47(c). It’s 
found that all the spurious eigenvalues are filtered out.

4. Conclusions 
    In the first-year project, the analytical and semi-analytical solutions for the 
Green’s functions of annulus and half-plane problems were obtained by using the 
image method. For the analytical solution of annular case, not only the image method 
(a special MFS) but also the Trefftz method were employed to solve the Green’s 
function of annular Laplace problem subjected to the fixed-free boundary conditions. 
The two solutions derived by using the Trefftz method and MFS were linked to be

    此行對於大陸的大學，有了進一步的了解，其中印象深刻的是，雖然很多都是屬於綜合型大學，
但是他們每個大學都有自身重點學科，有自我的特色，在大陸學術界裡有著自己的一席地位，例如：
湘潭大學數學與計算科學院，出了許多位中國科學院數學所的所長，而湖南大學機械與汽車工程學院
亦是該校的重點發展學科之一。反觀台灣，台灣這方面有待加強。這也是可以給海大做為一個參考。
我們在特色領域亦可爭取全台第一。反觀當今的台灣，大專院校林立，國私立大學有一百六七十所，
密度之高，堪稱世界之最。只要個位數的分數就能上大學，不知競爭力何在？許多學校都是小規模經
營，且發展目標特色不明確。而政府當局又積極的想讓台灣有一、兩所大學進入世界百大之林。或許，
為政者該好好思考目前台灣的教育政策與方針，以及教育資源的分配，這也是我此行意外的收穫。此
外，在湖南市區內鮮少看到汽油機車，取而代之的是電動機車，可見湖南省府在發展的同時，也兼顧
節能減碳的環保觀念。反觀台灣，機車滿街跑，所產生廢氣，亦是相當可觀，加上機車在車陣中東鑽
西竄，亦是增加行車危險，而機車意外事故的傷亡，也是報章新聞上屢見不鮮的新聞。所以，為了節
能減碳，環保電動車的推行，也是一個值得政府機關正視的問題。 
 
三、建議 
 本次研討會給我們的感覺是自我風格創立的重要性。由於大陸人口眾多，諸多教授底下有十幾位
博士生，故針對某些流行當紅的議題，他們皆可投入大量人力進行鑽研。此外，他們國內也提供許多
基金申請，讓許多年輕教授博士，能到國外不斷進修學習。因此，如何發展出自身的特色，走出自我
風格，實在是台灣教授極需深思的問題。如只是純粹跟著國際潮流走，無法創立自我風格，在眾多人
口的大陸威脅下，台灣將很快的被淘汰。此外，亦鼓勵多參與大陸研討會，在交流的過程中，可從大
陸學者的提問與答辯間，解答許多的疑惑；亦可在私下討論時，了解每位學者所關心與注意的焦點，
使我們對整體研究趨勢脈動有些許的了解，有助我們掌握新的研究方向，發展自我風格。因此，極力
希望教育部或國科會往後能極力補助國內老師、博士生、甚至碩士生，參與兩岸學術研討會，使其易
於了解與掌握大陸學者的研究動向。也期望國家能多設立許多基金會，補助年輕教授與博士後等學者，
使其能多出國訪問與進修學習，增加自我競爭力。此外也希望國家能多鼓勵國內大專院校多承辦兩岸
或者國際學術研討會，使無法獲得出國補助的學生及國內年輕教授學長，也能參與會議，增加與兩岸
四地與國外學者交流的機會，可提升台灣的競爭力。其次，也希望國內大專院校學能多與大陸與香港
大學進行交流，除了增加高層的交流外，也能多給基層老師與學生進行雙方互訪。多參考他們教育制
度的優點與學校發展的特色，來擬定一套適合國內發展的制度與增加學校自我發展定位。尤其近年中
國的崛起與進步是有目共睹的。取長補短與知彼知己，方可立於不敗之地。 
 
四、攜回資料名稱及內容 
    與會後攜回的主要資料，除了該會議的詳細議程外，以及一張大會論文集 CD 光碟片。
