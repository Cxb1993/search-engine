1. Abstract 
In this plan, we report the study of 
n-SiCN/i-SiCN/p-Si(100) heterojunction for 
low cost and high temperature ultraviolet (UV) 
detecting applications. The cubic crystalline 
SiCN films were deposited on p-Si(100) 
substrate with rapid thermal chemical vapor 
deposition (RTCVD). At 175°C, the measured 
current ratio of n-SiCN/i-SiCN/p-Si(100) 
heterojunction with and without irradiation of 
254 nm UV light, under -5 V, and 0.5mW/cm2 
is 5.42 Compared to the reported UV 
detectors with β-SiC MSM, the developed 
n-SiCN/i-SiCN/p-Si(100) heterojunction has 
the better current ratio in both room, and high 
temperature.

2. Introduction  
The demand for ultraviolet (UV) 
compact light detectors has rapidly increased 
owing to their potential applications in 
solid-state white lighting, solar-blind photo 
detection, biochemical sensors and medical 
instruments [1]. Additionally, it has been 
highly interesting to develop it for sensing 
rapidly mature InGaN light-emitting diodes 
(LED) and laser recently. In the past, major 
compact UV sensors were developed with 
GaN, β-SiC on Si, 4H-SiC, diamond, and 
6H-SiC. The GaN or 6H-SiC UV sensor has 
better high temperature characteristics [2], [3], 
but is more expensive [4]-[7]. Even, the β-SiC 
on Si substrate is inexpensive and has been 
studied widely for its lower cost. Nevertheless, 
its photo/dark current ratio (PDCR) is low, 
especially in high temperature [8], [9]. 
Bedsides, diamond including homoexpitaxial 
film on HPHT (high pressure high 
temperature) synthetic bulk [10], microwave 
plasma chemical vapor deposition 
polycrystalline film on 6H-SiC substrate [11], 
or boron doped diamond substrate [12], has a 
better dark current (~ pA), and very high 
operation temperature however, they still need 
expensive substrates to grow high quality 
diamond film. Hence, it is interesting to 
search a new material for low cost high 
temperature UV detecting applications. The 
wide band gap semiconductor, silicon carbon 
nitride (SiCN) has many interesting physical 
characteristics such as hardness, oxidation 
 4
of the c-SiCN film on p-Si substrate. As seen, 
peaks for SiCN at 45.46° [18], and 69.24° for 
Si are found in the heterojunction. This is 
because of the i-SiCN film heteroepitaxial 
growth on the Si substrate, which is 
evidenced by the superimposed diffraction 
patterns of crystalline Si (c-Si) and crystalline 
SiCN (c-SiCN) observed in the corresponding 
transmission electron diffraction (TEM) 
pattern presented in Figure 7. Besides, the 
SiCN TEM pattern indicates the grown SiCN 
is a cubic structure with lattice constant of 
4.359 Å [13], [19]. Both TEM and XRD 
indicate the SiCN film on p-Si (100) is a 
single crystalline. Moreover, the FWHM (full 
width at half maximum) for the c-SiCN on Si 
is 1.01 degree. Based on the TEM pattern, the 
d spacing can be calculated, and compared to 
the d spacing of the cubic c-SiCN described 
in ICDD (international center for diffraction 
data) [20], we conclude the RTCVD grown 
c-SiCN is cubic structure. Additionally, the 
current responsivity with a peak around 275 
nm for the heterojunction is illustrated in the 
Figure 8. The 275 nm peak implies the 
structure is preferred for deep UV detecting 
applications. Our previous photoluminescence 
(PL) measurement shows the SiCN/p-Si 
sample has a band gap of 3.77 eV [21], which 
is comparable to the 3.8 eV of microwave 
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition 
(MWCVD) deposited c-SiCN [15], and the 
4.4 eV of the electron cyclotron resonance 
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition 
(ECRCVD) deposited c-SiCN [16]. It is the 
feature of the higher band gap of SiCN to 
enhance the good thermal stability of the 
developed junctions. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The n-SiCN/i-SiCN/p-Si junction has 
been investigated and compared for low cost 
and high temperature ultraviolet (UV) 
detecting applications. The cubic crystalline 
SiCN films deposited on p-Si (100) substrate 
with RTCVD offers a higher band gap, and 
smooth morphology, thus results in a better 
photocurrent/dark current ratio of 53.7 and 
5.42 for room temperature, and at 175 °C, 
respectively. Compared to the reported UV 
detectors with β-SiC MSM, the developed 
n-SiCN/i-SiCN/p-Si heterojunction has the 
better current ratio in both room and high 
temperature, which implies the potential 
applications for high temperature UV sensors.
