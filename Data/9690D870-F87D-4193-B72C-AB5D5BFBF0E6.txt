the parallel combination of the output capacitance of the main
switch Sm and the auxiliary switch Sa. The buck–boost type of
the active clamp circuit includes an auxiliary switch Sa, and
a clamp capacitor Cc is used to achieve ZVS operation and
to limit voltage stress on the power switches. The transformer
winding turn ns1, capacitor C1, diode D1, output inductor Lo,
and capacitor Co are the circuit components of the isolated zeta
converter at the transformer secondary side. The transformer
winding turn ns2, diode D2, and output capacitor Co are the
circuit components of the flyback converter at the secondary
side. In the proposed converter, the main switch Sm and the
auxiliary switch Sa are all turned on at ZVS during the tran-
sition between main switch and auxiliary switch. This enables
the converter to operate with higher switching frequency and
reduction in the size of reactive components.
III. PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION
Before system analysis of the proposed converter shown in
Fig. 1(d), some assumptions are made during one switching
cycle of operation.
– The resonant period by the clamp capacitance Cc and
resonant inductance Lr is greater than the turn-off time
of the main switch Sm.
– The clamp capacitance Cc is larger than the resonant
capacitance Cr (Cr  Cc).
– The resonant inductance is less than the magnetizing
inductance (Lr  Lm).
– The energy stored in the resonant inductor Lr is greater
than the energy stored in the resonant capacitor Cr in
order to achieve ZVS operation for both switches Sm
and Sa.
– The turn ratios between the primary winding turn
and the secondary winding turn are n1 = np/ns1 and
n2 = np/ns2.
The circuit behavior of the proposed converter during one
switching cycle of operation is divided into seven operating
stages. The key waveforms of the proposed converter in a
switching cycle are illustrated in Fig. 2. The equivalent circuits
of the proposed converter in each operating stage are shown
in Fig. 3. In the following, the circuit analysis and opera-
tional principle of the proposed converter for each stage are
described.
Stage 1 [t1 < t < t2; Fig. 3(a)]: In this stage, the main
switch Sm turns on, and the auxiliary switch Sa turns
off. The magnetizing inductor voltage vLm = Lmvin/(Lr +
Lm) ≈ vin. In this stage, vCr = vSm,ds = 0, vSa,ds = vin +
vCc , vs1 = vLm/n1, and vs2 = vLm/n2. The output diodes D1
and D2 are all turned off. The input energy is transferred to the
output load by the zeta converter. The primary side current iLr
increases and is expressed as
iLr (t) = iLm(t) + is1(t)/n1
≈ iLm(t1) +
vin
Lm + Lr
(t− t1) + is1(t)

switch Sa is turned on. In this stage, the primary voltage
vLm ≈ −vCc = −n1vC = −n2vo, so diodes D1 and D2 are
turned on. If the capacitance C is large enough, the capacitor
voltage vC can be considered as a constant voltage. Capacitor
Cc and inductor Lr are resonant in this stage. The current iLr
and voltage vCc are expressed as
vCc(t) = vC + (vCc(t3)− vC) cos(t− t3)/
√
CcLr
+ iLr (t3)
√
Lr/Cc sin(t− t3)/

√
CcLr
− (vCc(t3)− vC)
√
Cc/Lr sin(t− t3)/
√
CcLr.
(8)
The inductor current iLr decreases in this stage. Before the
inductor current iLr becomes a negative value, the switch
Sa should be turned on to achieve ZVS. The output in-
ductor voltage vLo = −vo and the output inductor current
iLo decrease. The diode currents iD1 = iLo − is1 and iD2 =
n2(iLr − is1/n1). The magnetizing inductor current iLm de-
creases in this stage. This stage ends when switch Sa is
turned on.
Stage 4 [t4 < t < t5, Fig. 3(d)]: This stage starts at time
t = t4 when switch Sa is turned on and ends at time t = t5
when switch Sa is turned off. At time t = t4, Sa is turned on
at ZVS since the switch current iSa is negative. The inductor
voltage vLr = −vCc + vC < 0 so that the inductor current iLr
decreases from positive to negative value. The primary side
voltage vLm = −n1vC < 0 so that the magnetizing inductor
current iLm decreases in this stage. The output diode D1 is
turned on. The output inductor voltage vLo = −vo. Therefore,
the output inductor current iLo decreases. The diode current

where ∆B is the working flux density, Ae is the effective cross-
sectional area of the selected transformer core, and T is the
switching period. If the turn ratio n and the primary winding
turns np are given, the secondary winding turns ns1 and ns2 are
given as ns1 = ns2 = np/n. The voltage stresses of the main
and auxiliary switches are expressed as
VSm,stress = VSa,stress ≈ Vin,max + VCc = Vin,max/(1−D)
(19)
where Vin,max is the allowed maximum input voltage. When the
main switch Sm is turned on at stage 1, the current ripple on the
magnetizing inductor is given as
∆iLm ≈ Vin,minDeﬀT/(2Lm). (20)
If the ripple current on the magnetizing inductor is given, the
magnetizing inductance is obtained as
Lm = Vin,minDeﬀT/(2∆iLm). (21)

. (23)
To ensure ZVS operation for the main switch Sm, the resonant
inductance can be expressed as
Lr >
Cr(vin,max + nvo)2
I2Sm,max
. (24)
If the ripple current on the output inductor is given, the output
inductance can be obtained as
Lo = (1−D)TVo/∆iLo . (25)
Based on the current–second balance on capacitors C and
CC , we can obtain the average currents ILo = DeﬀIo, ID1 =
DeﬀIo, and ID2 = (1−Deﬀ)Io. The rms current on the induc-
tor Lo is expressed as
ILo,rms ≈ Io

In stage 5, the energy stored in the inductor Lr must be
greater than the energy stored in capacitor Cr to create the

In stage 4, capacitor Cc and inductor Lr are resonant about
one-half of the resonant period. One-half of the resonant period
should be greater than the maximum turn-off time of the main
switch

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To verify the validity of the proposed active clamp
zeta–flyback converter, a prototype circuit shown in Fig. 4 has
been implemented. The active clamp PWM IC UCC2893 is
used as the controller to regulate the output voltage and generate
the gate signals for switches Sm and Sa. Fig. 5 gives the
measured waveforms of gate voltage, drain voltage, and switch
current of the main switch Sm under different output loads.
Before the main switch is turned on, the drain voltage of the
main switch has been decreased to zero. It can be observed that
the switch current is negative before the switching device Sm
is turned on. The body diode is conducting the negative switch

clamp voltage vCc is almost constant. Fig. 7(b) shows the
experimental results of gate voltage vSm,g , switch current iSm ,
clamp current or negative auxiliary switch current −iSa , and
primary current iLr . When the main switch Sm is turned on,
the primary current iLr flows through the main switch Sm.

www.ietdl.orgproposed to substantially reduce switching losses on
the semiconductors and reduce passive component
size. However, the drawback of a resonant converter
is high-voltage stresses on switching devices
especially for high-input voltage. The asymmetrical
pulse-width modulation (PWM) [5–12] and phase-
shift PWM [13–17] techniques were proposed to
regulate the output voltage and to achieve ZVS turn-
on. The voltage and current stresses of switching
devices are related to duty cycle in the asymmetrical
PWM forward converter. In an asymmetrical half-
bridge converter, the voltage stress of switches equals
the input voltage, however, the drawback of the
asymmetrical half-bridge converter is high pulsating
input current. The transformer primary voltage is also
related to duty cycle and the split DC capacitor voltages
are not equal. The DC clamp capacitor used in the
asymmetrical half-bridge converter will limit the circuit
in low input current applications. The high cost and
narrow ZVS range for the lagging leg of the full-bridge
converter are the main disadvantages in the phase-shift
PWM technique. The active clamp techniques [18–20]
have been proposed to recycle the energy stored in the
leakage and magnetising inductors and to limit the
voltage stress of switching devices. The further
information of active clamping and clamp capacitor has
been presented in [21, 22].
The new isolated Cuk converter with parallel
connection at the output side is proposed to achieve
ZVS operation for both main and auxiliary
switches. A buck-boost stage active snubber circuit is
used in the conventional isolated Cuk converter to
allow the utilisation of leakage inductance of the
transformer, to achieve ZVS operation and to limit
the voltage stresses on the power switches. There are
two transformers in the proposed converter. The
primary windings of two transformers are
connected in series. Compared with the parallel
connection of two DC/DC converters, the proposed
converter has less power semiconductors in the
primary side. The output sides of the proposed
converter are connected in parallel to share the
load current. Compared with the asymmetrical
half-bridge converter, the proposed converter has
less ripple currents on the input and output sides.
The transformer primary voltage in the
proposed converter is greater than the primary
voltage in the asymmetrical half-bridge converter. The
general purpose PWM IC and one gate drive are used
in the proposed converter to regulate the output
voltage. First, the circuit configuration of the
proposed converter is discussed. The system
analysis, steady-state analysis and circuit design
consideration are presented. Finally, the experimental
results based on a 300 W prototype circuit are
presented to verify the effectiveness and performance
of the proposed converter.he Institution of Engineering and Technology 20082 Circuit configuration and
principles of operation
Figs. 1a and 1b show the conventional Cuk and isolated
Cuk converters, respectively. The main advantages of
the Cuk converter are low inductor ripple currents
and buck-boost type of output voltage. To increase the
output power and achieve parallel operation, the
parallel connection of two isolated Cuk converters are
shown in Fig. 1c. However, power switches operates
at hard switching and so the circuit efficiency is low.
The output currents of two converters are not
balanced if the PWM signals of the two converters are
not controlled well. Fig. 1d gives the circuit
configuration of the proposed ZVS PWM Cuk
converter. The input voltage vin, two isolation
transformers, inductor L1, capacitors C1 and main

considered as the constant values); (4) Joule and iron losses
are neglected in both inductances and transformer; (5) the
resonant inductance Lr is smaller than the magnetising
inductances Lm; (6) all semiconductor components are mod-

winding turn of transformer and the secondary winding
turn is n ¼ np=ns; and (8) the energy stored in the resonant
inductance Lr is greater than energy stored in the resonant
capacitance Cr to achieve ZVS operation. The key
waveforms of the proposed converter are given in Fig. 2.
Based on Fig. 2, the main and auxiliary switches
are turned on at ZVS. The switching losses due to
switch turn-on instant are effectively reduced. However,
both switching are not turned off at ZCS, therefore
there are some switching losses at turn-off instant. The
features of the proposed converter are ZVS turn-on,
low-voltage stresses on the main and auxiliary switches,
less additional circuit components in the conventional
isolated Cuk converter (one switch and one clamp
capacitor) and easy control algorithm using commercial
PWM IC and gate driver. There are six operating stages
of the proposed converter in a switching period. Fig. 3

each operating stage.

The experimental results are provided in this Section to
verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter. The
proposed converter was implemented with the following
parameters: vin ¼ 130 V  180 V, vo ¼ 12 V, Po,max ¼
170 W, fs ¼ 70 kHz (switching frequency). The ETD-39
core with Bmax ¼ 2000 G and Ae ¼ 1.25 cm2 was used as
an isolation transformer. The turn ratio between the trans-
former primary side winding turn np ¼ 34 and secondary
side winding turn ns ¼ 4. The magnetising inductance of
the transformer is designed as Lm ¼ 300 mH. The delay
time between the gate signals of main switch S and auxiliary
switch Sa is 300 ns. The resonant capacitor Cr ¼ 450pF.
The selected resonant inductor Lr is about 30 mH. The
input and output inductances are L1 ¼ 1.5 mH and
L2 ¼ 75 mH. The selected clamp capacitance Cc ¼ 490 nF.
The selected output filter capacitance Co is 2200 mF. The
capacitances C1 ¼ C2 ¼ 6.6 mF. The S60SC6M is used for
diode D in the secondary side. The MOSFETs IRFP460
are used for main and auxiliary switches in the
proposed converter. Fig. 5 shows a photograph of the
prototype circuit. Fig. 6 shows the measured gate
voltage and drain voltage of power switch S for a con-
ventional hard switching Cuk converter. From Fig. 6a,
the drain voltage is still at high voltage level when
the gate voltage is changed from low voltage to high
load variation
current iS is negative to discharge capacitor Cr in order to
achieve ZVS operation for main switch S. When main
switch S is turned on, the drain current iS equals input
inductor current iL1 and capacitor current iC1. When
main switch S is turned off, capacitor current iC1 ¼ iL1
and switch current iS ¼ 0.
Fig. 9b illustrates the measured results of the gate voltage
vS,gs, capacitor current iC1, resonant current iLr and clamp
capacitor current iCc. When main switch S is turned on,
the clamp capacitor current is zero and capacitor current
iC1 equals the resonant inductor current iLr. When main
switch S is turned off, the auxiliary switch Sa is turned on.
In this interval, the resonant inductor current iLr equals
the capacitor current iC1 and clamp capacitor current iCc.
Fig. 9c gives the experimental waveforms of gate voltage
vS,gs, resonant current iLr, capacitor current iC2 and diode
current iD. The diode current iD equals zero when main
buck-boost stage are presented in this paper. In the proposed
circuit, the leakage inductance of the transformer is also
used as one part of the resonant inductance to achieve
ZVS operation of main and auxiliary switches. The
advantages of the proposed ZVS Cuk converter are low
switching losses on power semiconductors, low voltage
stress on primary switches, low output inductor current
ripple, and smaller transformer required, due to two
quadrant core swing. The mathematical equations of the
proposed converter in each of the operation stages are
analysed. The design consideration of the proposed
converter is also included. Finally the experimental results
based on a prototype circuit with rated 170W output are
provided to verify ZVS operation of both main and auxiliary
switches.switch S is turned on. The measured waveforms of gate
voltage vS,gs, capacitor current iC2, diode current iD and
inductor current iL2 are shown in Fig. 9d. When switch S
turns on, the diode current iD ¼ 0 and iL2 ¼ iC2. If switch
S turns off, the output inductor current iL2 ¼ iC2þ iD.
Fig. 9e illustrates the experimental results of drain voltages
vS,ds and vSa,ds, capacitor voltage vC1 and clamp
capacitor voltage vCc. The sum of drain voltages
vS;ds þ vSa;ds ¼ vC1 þ vCc. When switch S turns off and
auxiliary switch Sa turns on, the clamp capacitor Cc is res-
onant with magnetising inductor and resonant inductor.
Fig. 9f gives the experimental waveforms of gate voltage
vS,gs, clamp capacitor voltage vCc and capacitor voltages
vC1 and vC2. The average voltage value of capacitor C2
equals the output voltage vo.
Fig. 10a gives the experimental output voltage and output
current under the step load variation between Po ¼ 60 W
and Po ¼ 96 W. The measured output voltage and output
current under the step load variation between Po ¼ 96 W
and Po ¼ 156 W are shown in Fig. 10b. From the measured
results in Fig. 10, the output voltage of the proposed conver-
ter is less sensitive to the load variations. To compare the
circuit efficiency of the proposed converter and the conven-
tional Cuk converter, Fig. 11 shows the measured efficien-
cies of the proposed converter and the hard switching Cuk
converter. Based on Fig. 11, the proposed converter has
better circuit efficiency. The measured efficiency of the pro-
posed converter is about 88.5% at the rated output power
(12V/14A). Fig. 12 shows the measured results of the
proposed xconverter at the rated output power under the
input AC source voltage vs ¼ 90 Vrms. The ZVS feature
of both switches in the proposed converter is also achieved.

 converter at the secondary side. In the proposed converter, main 
switch Q and auxiliary switch Qa are all turned on at ZVS during 
the transition interval between Q and Qa. When main switch Q is 
turned on, the input power is transferred to the output load 
through the Cuk converter. When main switch Q is turned off 
and auxiliary Qa is turned on, the energy stored in the clamp 
capacitor Cc and resonant inductor Lr is transferred to output 
load through Sepic converter.

III. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION 
Some assumptions are made during one switching cycle of 
operation to simplify the system analysis of the proposed 
converter given in Fig. 1. (1) Capacitance C1, C2, Cc>>Cr; (2) 
Inductance Lm>>Lr; (3) The resonant period by the lamp 
capacitance Cc and resonant inductance Lr is greater than 
turn-off time of main switch Q; (4) The energy stored in the 
resonant inductor Lr is greater than energy stored in the resonant 
capacitor Cr in order to achieve ZVS operation for both switches 
Q and Qa; (5) The turn ratios of transformer n=np/ns1=np/ns2. 
During one switching cycle of operation, the circuit behavior of 
the proposed converter can be divided into seven operation 
modes. Fig. 2 gives the main key waveforms in a switching 
cycle. Fig. 3 gives the equivalent circuits of the proposed 
converter in each operation mode. Before time t0, switch Q and 
the rectifier diodes D1 and D2 at the transformer secondary side 
are all turned on. 
Mode 1 (t0<t<t1): This mode starts at time t0 when the rectifier 
diodes D1 and D2 are all turned off. In this mode, the main 
switch Q is turned on and the auxiliary switch Qa is turned off. 
The input current charges the input inductor L1 so that the input 
current iL1 increases linearly.

at time t1 when the main switch Q is turned off. 
Mode 2 (t1<t<t2): This mode starts at time t1 when the main 
switch Q is turned off. The input inductor current iL1 and the 
capacitor current iC1 charge the capacitor Cr from 0 to vC1+vCc. 
The capacitance Cr is small enough to be charged quickly. The

The input current iL1, switch current iQ and capacitor current iC1

secondary side iD1=iD2=0. The output inductor current is given

At time t2, the capacitor voltage vCr=vC1+vCc, the anti-parallel

Mode 3 (t2<t<t3): At time t2, the capacitor voltage vCr=vC1+vCc

so that the inductor currents at the primary and secondary side

in this mode so that the primary side voltage vLm=nvo and the 
magnetizing inductor current increases linearly. To ensure ZVS 
operation of the main switch Q, the capacitor voltage vCr should 
reach zero before the end of this mode. Therefore the energy 
stored in the resonant inductor Lr must be greater than the energy 
stored in the resonant capacitor Cr.

main switch Q is turned on. The rectifier diodes at the secondary 
side are still turned on. The magnetizing inductor voltage

inductor voltage vLr=vC1+nvo>0 so that the inductor current iLr 
increases in this mode. Since vL1>0 and vL2<0, the inductor 
current iL1 increases and iL2 decreases in this mode. The diode 
currents iD1 and iD2 decrease. Before the switch current iQ=iL1+iLr 
is positive, the main switch Q should be turned on to achieve 
ZVS. This mode ends at time t6 when the main switch Q is turned 
on. 
Mode 7 (t6<t<t0): This mode starts at time t6 when switch Q is 
turned on. The circuit analysis in this mode is almost the same as 
the circuit analysis in the mode 6. The main switch current iQ 
increases from negative to positive value. The secondary side 
current iC2 increases from negative to positive value and the 
diode currents iD1 and iD2 decrease to zero. This mode ends at 
time t0 when the diode currents iD1=iD2=0. The circuit goes to the 
operation mode 1 to begin the next switching cycle. 
IV. STEADY STATE ANALYSIS 
Based on the key waveforms shown in Fig. 2, the delay time 
between two switches Q and Qa at modes 2, 3, 5 and 6 is 
neglected and the voltages on the capacitors Cc, C1 and C2 are 
constant. These assumptions are made to obtain the average 
voltages on the capacitors C1, C2 , Cc and Co. When the main 
switch Q is turned on and the auxiliary switch Qa is turned off in 
mode 1, the input and output inductor voltages vL1=Vin and vL2≈ 
VC1/n+VC2-Vo. The voltage across the inductors Lr and Lm 
equals -VC1 and the secondary side voltage Vs1=-VC1/n. In mode 
4, the input and output inductor voltages vL1=Vin-VC1-VCc and 
vL2=-Vo. The voltage across the inductors Lr and Lm equals VCc 
and the secondary side voltage Vs1=-Vo=-VC2. In mode 7, the 
input and output inductor voltages vL1=Vin and vL2=-Vo. The 
voltage across the inductors Lr and Lm equals -VC1 and the 
secondary side voltage Vs1=-Vo=-VC2. In steady state analysis, 
the voltage-second product across the input inductor when the 
main switch Q or the anti-parallel body diode of Q is turned on 
should equal the voltage-second product when the main switch 
Q and the anti-parallel body diode of Q are turned off. 
VinDT=(VC1+VCc-Vin)(1-D)T       (12) 
where D is the duty cycle of the main switch Q and Vin, VC1 and 
VCc are average voltage value of input voltage and capacitors C1 
and Cc, respectively. Based on the voltage-second balance on the 
output inductor L2, one can obtain the following equation.

where Dloss=t0/T is the duty cycle loss of the converter in mode 7.

If the duty cycle D is less than 0.5, the clamp capacitor voltage 
VCc<Vin. If the duty cycle D is greater than 0.5, the clamp 
voltage VCc>Vin. Therefore, the voltage on the clamp capacitor 
Cc is operated as a buck-boost type of active snubber. If the duty 
cycle loss Dloss in mode 7 is zero, the output voltage can be 
expressed as Vo=DVin/[n(1-D)]. This equation equals the output 
voltage in the conventional isolated Cuk converter. 
V. DESIGN CONSIDERATION 
The design process of the ZVS Sepic-Cuk converter with 
buck-boost type of active snubber is considered in this section. 
One assumed that the maximum effective duty cycle of proposed 
converter is Deff=Dmax-Dloss. The voltage conversion ratio of the

third winding current iC2. When main switch Q is turned off in 
mode 4, the output inductor current iL2 equals the capacitor 
current iC2 and diode current iD2.

IV CONCLUSION 
 This paper presents the system analysis, operation principle 
and design consideration of a ZVS Sepic-Cuk converter with an 
active snubber. Active snubber circuit is used to limit the peak 
voltage stress of main switch. In the proposed converter, the 
primary side circuit components are the same as the primary side 
circuit components of Sepic converter and Cuk converter. The 
secondary side circuit components in the proposed converter are 
parallel-connected of the secondary sides of Sepic and Cuk 
converters to share the load current. The Sepic converter and 
active snubber circuit can achieve the magnetizing flux reset 
when main switch Q is turned off. The advantages of the 
proposed converter are low switching losses and low voltage 
stress on the switches and load current sharing.

current iLr will flow through resonant capacitor Cr. The capacitor 
Cr will be discharged to zero voltage. When the capacitor 
voltage vCr=0, the anti-parallel diode of switch Q is turned on. 
Therefore the main switch Q can be turned on at this instant to 
achieve ZVS.

III. OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES 
In the system analysis of the proposed converter, the energy 
stored in the resonant inductor Lr is greater than energy stored in 
the resonant capacitor Cr to achieve ZVS for switches Q and Qa. 
Inductances of L1 and L2 are greater than resonant inductance of 
Lr. Capacitances of C1, Cc and Co are large enough such that the 
capacitor voltages vC1, vCc and vo are constant during a switching 
period. The time sequence of key waveforms in the proposed 
converter is presented in Fig. 2. Based on the on/off states of 
switches, Q and Qa, and diodes, D1, D2 and D3, the proposed 
converter has eight operation modes. The corresponding 
equivalent circuits for each operation mode are shown in Fig. 3. 
Mode 1 [t0<t<t1]: In this mode, switch Q is on, auxiliary switch 
Qa is off, diodes D1 and D3 are off, and diode D2 is on. Since, L1 
and L2 >> Lr, the inductor voltages vL1≈vin and vL2≈vC1-vo>0. 
The inductor currents iL1 and iL2 increase in this mode and can be 
expressed as:

Mode 2 [t1<t<t2]: This mode starts at time t1 when switch Q is 
turned off. The capacitor Cr is charged by the inductor current iLr 
from zero voltage to vC1-vLr≈vC1. Since the capacitance of Cr is 
small enough, the capacitor Cr is linearly charged. The capacitor

In this mode, the inductor currents iL1 and iL2 are almost 
constant. The capacitor voltage vCr<vC1 and vCc so that the 
diodes D1 and D3 are blocked and the anti-parallel diode of 
switch Qa are off. This mode ends at time t2 when the capacitor 
voltage vCr=vC1. At time t2, diode D3 is turned on to commutate 
the inductor current iL2. The time interval in this mode is given 
as:

Mode 3 [t2<t<t3]: At time t2, both diodes D2 and D3 are on to 
commutate the inductor current iL2. In this mode, the diode 
current iD2 decreases and iD3 increases. When the capacitor 
voltage vCr equals vCc at time t3, the inductor current iLr flows 
through the anti-parallel diode of switch Qa. 
Mode 4 [t3<t<t4]: When vCr=vCc at time t3, the inductor current 
iLr flows through the anti-parallel diode of switch Qa. Since D2

V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The effectiveness of the proposed converter is verified by the 
experimental results based on a 240W prototype. The main 
circuit parameters of the proposed converter in Fig. 1 are shown 
in Table 1. Figs. 4 and 5 give the measured gate voltage, drain 
voltage and switch current for switches Q and Qa under the light 
and full load conditions. Before the switching devices are turned 
on, the switch current is negative and the drain voltage has been 
decreased to zero. Therefore, both switches are turned on at 
ZVS. Fig. 6 shows the measured key current waveforms of the 
proposed converter at full output load. When switch Q is turned 
on, then iQ=iLr, iQa=0, the diode D2 is on, diodes D1 and D3 are 
off, and the inductor current iL1 and iL2 increase. When switch Q 
is turned off and Qa is turned on, then iQ=0, iQa=-iLr, diode D2 is 
off, diodes D1 and D3 are on, and the inductor current iL1 and iL2 
decrease. From the measured results in Fig. 6, we can see that 
iL1+iC1=iLr, iD2=iD1+iC1, iLr+iQa=iQ and iL2=iD2+iD3. Based on the 
power meter measurement, Table 2 shows the measured 
efficiency of the proposed converter. The maximum circuit 
efficiency is about 92.8%. In the proposed converter, the active 
snubber is connected in parallel with the main switch Q. The 
other type of active snubber is connected in parallel with the 
input inductor as shown in Fig. 7. The operation behavior of this 
circuit topology is almost the same as that in Fig. 1. The only 
difference is the voltage stress on the clamp capacitor Cc. The 
capacitor voltage vCc=vin/(1-D) in Fig. 1 and vCc=vinD/(1-D) in 
Fig. 7. Therefore, the clamp capacitor Cc shown in Fig. 7 has 
less voltage stress.

range ac voltage source followed by a diode rectifier. The dc
voltage vi, can be higher than 370V if the ac voltage source is
265Vrms. The two-switch converter topology is used in the
proposed converter to reduce the voltage stress of active
switches. In the primary side, the switching devices SIa and Sib
and the isolated transformer are the basic circuit to operate in
the pulse width modulation (PWM). The active clamp circuit
consisted of switches S2a and S2b and clamp capacitor C is used
to absorb the surge energy due to the transformer leakage
inductance in order to reduce the voltage stress of active
switches in the proposed converter. The resonance based on the
resonant capacitors Cr,Sia and Cr,sib and resonant inductor Lr
achieves the ZVS operation of switches Sla and Slb. The clamp
capacitor C and resonant inductor Lr are resonant to achieve
ZVS operation for switches S2a and S2b. Lm is the magnetizing
inductance of the isolated transformer. In the secondary side of
the isolated transformer, the current doubler rectifier is used to
reduce the current rating of transformer secondary winding and
to increase the circuit efficiency. The ripple current on the
output capacitor is reduced because the ripple currents of
output inductors iLi and iL2 are partially cancelled each other.
The rectifier diodes DI and D2 are all turned off at zero current
switching (ZCS).

III. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION
The circuit analysis of the proposed converter is based on
the following assumptions: (1) All semiconductors are ideal;
(2) The capacitance C>>Cr (Crsia=CrSib=Cr,S2a=Cr) and the
clamp capacitor voltage vc is a constant value when Sia and Slb
are turned on; (3) The output capacitance CO is large enough
and the output voltage is a constant value; (4) The inductance
Lr<<Lm; (5) The turn ratio of secondary winding to primary
winding is n=nslnp; (6) The energy stored in the resonant
inductance Lr is greater than energy stored in the resonant
capacitance Cr to achieve ZVS operation. The carrier based
PWM is used in the proposed converter to regulate the output
voltage. The key waveforms of the proposed converter are
shown in Fig. 2. Ten operation stages in a switching cycle can
be found in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 gives the equivalent circuits of the
proposed converter in a switching cycle.
Stage I [to < t < t1, Fig. 3(a)] In this stage the switching
devices Sia and Sib are turned. The voltage Vp=Vin. The
magnetizing current increases linearly. The secondary side
Stage 2 [t1<t<t2, Fig. 3(b)]: This stage begins at time t=ti
when switches SIa and Slb are turned off. The capacitors Cr,Sia
and Cr,slb are charged linearly from 0 to vi/2 by current i'Lr and
capacitor Cr,S2a is discharged linearly from vi, to vi,/2. In this
stage the capacitor voltages VCr,Sla<Vinl2 and VCr,Slb<Vinl2. The
primary and secondary side voltages are positive. The output
inductor current iLi increases and inductor current iL2 decreases.
The rectifier diode DI turns off and diode D2 turns on. This
stage ends when the capacitor voltage VCr,Sla equals vjn12 at time
t=t2. At time t=t2, the transformer magnetizing voltage VLm=0.
The secondary side diodes DI and D2 are turned on. The filter
inductor current iLL(t2) is reaching the maximum values ILi,max

Vin-VC and v5<O. The resonant circuit in this stage includes the
resonant inductance Lr, magnetizing inductance Lm and clamp
capacitance C. The stage is ended when the switches S2a and
S2b are turned off.
Stage 7 [t6<t<t7, Fig. 3(g)]: At time t=t6 the switches S2a and
S2b are turned off The operation of this stage is similar to the
operation in stage 2 except the current iLr is negative and
rectifier diode DI is turned on. The voltage Vp=Vin-VCr,SiaVCr,Sib
The primary side current iLr discharges capacitors Cr,Sia and
Cr,sib and charges capacitor Cr,S2a. The rectifier diode currents
iD2=0 and i io. At time t=t7, the capacitor voltage
VCr,Sia+VCr,Sib v1i, Vp=O and the magnetizing inductor voltage
VLm =0. The secondary side diodes are all turned on. The output
inductor current iL2(t7) 'L2,max. The magnetizing current equals
the minimum value iLm(t7)=ILm,min
Stage 8 [t7<t<t8, Fig. 3(h)]: At time t=t7, the transformer
voltage VLm=0 and vs=0. The rectifier diodes DI and D2 are all
turned on. The diode current iDi decreases and diode current iD2
increases. The magnetizing current iLm(t)=ILm,min The output
inductor currents iLi and iL2 decrease. The resonant inductance
Lr and resonant capacitance 2Cr 3 are resonant. At time t8, the
capacitor voltage Vcr,slb=0 and VCr,S2a=vin. The intrinsic diode of
switch Slb is turned on. To ensure ZVS operation to turn on
switch Slb, the capacitor voltage Vcr,sib should reach zero
before the end of this stage. Therefore the energy stored in the
resonant inductor Lr must be greater than the energy stored in
the resonant capacitor Cr,Sib.
Stage 9 [t8<t<tg, Fig. 3(i)]: This stage begins at time t8 when
voltage Vcr,sib equals 0 and body diode of switch Slb is turned
on. This stage ends at time tg when capacitor voltage VCrSla=O
and body diode of switch Sla is turned on. The rectifier diodes
at the secondary side are still in the free wheeling mode. The
resonant tank includes the resonant inductance L¾ and the
resonant capacitance Cr,Sla. At time tg the capacitor voltage
VCr,Sla equals zero and the intrinsic diode of switch Sla is turned
on.
Stage 10 [t9<t<to]: At time t=t9 the intrinsic body diode of
switches Sla and Slb are turned on. The rectifier diodes DI and
D2 are still operated in the free wheeling mode. The diode
current iD2 is increasing until =D2 io, and diode current iD, is
decreasing until to zero. At this moment the stage 10 ends and
the circuit goes to the stage 1. The magnetizing inductance
voltage VLm=0. The output inductor currents decrease in this
stage. The leakage inductor voltage VL. equals input dc voltage
vin and the primary side current increases. Before the primary
side current iLr becomes positive, the switches Sla and Slb
should be turned on to achieve ZVS operation. This stage is
ended at t=to when iLr(t0)=ILm,min+±ILi,min and ILi,min=iLL(tO).
IV. STEADY STATE AND DESIGN CONSIDERATION
One assumes that the duty cycle loss due to time delay
between switches Sla and S2a at stages 2-4 and 7-9 is neglected.
When power switches Sla and Slb are turned on and switches
S2a and S2b are turned off at stage 1, the transformer primary
voltage v.=viv. The output inductor voltages VLi=nVin-Vo and
VL2=-Vo. When switches SIa and Slb are turned off and switches
S2a and S2b are turned on at stage 6, the primary voltage vp=-Vin-
vc. The output inductor voltages VLi=-vo and VL2=n(Vin+VC)-Vo.
Based on the voltage-second balance across the primary
inductance Lm, one can obtain the clamp voltage vc.
2D -1
VC y-D-D Vin
where D is the duty cycle of switches SIa and Slb, and Dloss is
the duty cycle loss of the converter operated in the free
wheeling mode at stages 5 and 10. The duty cycle loss depends
on the load current. The duty cycle loss at high output current
is larger than the duty cycle loss at the low output current. Due
to the voltage-second balance for the output inductors LI and
L2, the output voltage can be expressed as:
vo = n(D - DIOSS)Vin (2)
When the switch SI turns on, the current ripple of magnetizing
inductance is
AiLm (3)Vin (D-Dloss)T

where T is the switching period. From (2) and (3), the current
ripple ofmagnetizing inductance can be further expressed as:

The ripple currents on output inductors LI and L2 are given as:

From (5) one can obtain the output inductances.

 that is the sum of transformer leakage inductance and 
external inductance, and Cr is the resonant capacitance 
that is the parallel combination of the output capacitance 
of main switch Q and auxiliary switch Qa. Active 
snubber circuit including an auxiliary switch Qa and a 
clamp capacitor Cc is used to achieve ZVS operation of 
Q
 
and Qa and to limit the voltage stress on power 
switches. The transformer winding turn ns2, capacitor C2, 
diode D2, output inductor L2 and capacitor Co are the 
circuit components of isolated Cuk converter at the 
transformer secondary side. The transformer winding 
turn ns1, diode D1 and output capacitor Co are the circuit 
components of the Sepic converter at the secondary side. 
In the proposed converter, main switch Q and auxiliary 
switch Qa are all turned on at ZVS during the transition 
interval between Q and Qa. When main switch Q is 
turned on, the input power is transferred to the output 
load through the Cuk converter. When main switch Q is 
turned off and auxiliary Qa is turned on, the energy 
stored in the clamp capacitor Cc and resonant inductor Lr 
is transferred to output load through Sepic converter.

3. Principle of Operation 
Some assumptions are made during one switching 
cycle of operation to simplify the system analysis of the 
proposed converter given in Fig. 1. (1) Capacitance C1, 
C2, Cc>>Cr; (2) Inductance Lm>>Lr; (3) The resonant 
period by the lamp capacitance Cc and resonant 
inductance Lr is greater than turn-off time of main switch 
Q; (4) The energy stored in the resonant inductor Lr is 
greater than energy stored in the resonant capacitor Cr in 
order to achieve ZVS operation for both switches Q and 
Qa; (5) The turn ratios of transformer n=np/ns1=np/ns2. 
During one switching cycle of operation, the circuit 
behavior of the proposed converter can be divided into 
seven operation modes. Fig. 2 gives the main key 
waveforms in a switching cycle. Fig. 3 gives the 
equivalent circuits of the proposed converter in each 
operation mode. Before time t0, switch Q and the rectifier 
diodes D1 and D2 at the transformer secondary side are 
all turned on. 
Mode 1 (t0<t<t1): This mode starts at time t0 when the 
rectifier diodes D1 and D2 are all turned off. In this 
mode, the main switch Q is turned on and the auxiliary 
switch Qa is turned off. The input current charges the 
input inductor L1 so that the input current iL1 increases 
linearly.

The resonant capacitor voltage vCr=0. The magnetizing

main switch Q is turned off. The input inductor current 
iL1 and the capacitor current iC1 charge the capacitor Cr 
from 0 to vC1+vCc. The capacitance Cr is small enough to 
be charged quickly. The capacitor voltage vCr can be

In this mode the capacitor voltage vCr<vC1+vCc so that the

The input current iL1, switch current iQ and capacitor

 ends at time t3 when auxiliary switch Qa is turned on. 
Mode 4 (t3<t<t4): This mode starts at time t3 when the 
auxiliary switch Qa is turned on and ends at time t4 when 
the auxiliary switch Qa is turned off. At time t3, Qa is 
turned on at ZVS since the switch current iQa is negative. 
Since the inductor voltage vL1 is negative, the input 
inductor current iL1 decreases linearly in this mode. The 
circuit components Lr and Cc are resonant in this mode as 
(8). The inductor current iLr decreases from positive to 
negative value. The switch current iQa=-iLr-iL1 will 
increase from negative to positive value. The primary 
side voltage vLm=nvo>0 so that the magnetizing inductor 
current iLm increases in this mode. The rectifier diodes 
D1 and D2 are turned on. The output inductor voltage 
vL2=-vo. Therefore the output inductor current iL2 
decreases. The capacitor current iC2=n(iLr+iLm)+iD1. The 
capacitor current iC2 will decrease from positive to 
negative value. This mode ends at time t4 when the 
auxiliary switch Qa is turned off. 
Mode 5 (t4<t<t5): This mode starts at time t4 when the 
auxiliary switch Qa is turned off. Since iLr+iL1<0 so that 
the main switch current iQ=iLr+iL1 is negative. The 
negative switch current iQ will discharge capacitor Cr 
from vCc+vC1 to 0 in this mode. The capacitor voltage vCr

where iLr(t4)+iL1(t4) is negative. This time interval is very 
short so that the inductor currents at the primary and 
secondary side are almost constant. The rectifier diodes 
D1 and D2 are still on in this mode so that the primary 
side voltage vLm=nvo and the magnetizing inductor 
current increases linearly. To ensure ZVS operation of 
the main switch Q, the capacitor voltage vCr should reach 
zero before the end of this mode. Therefore the energy 
stored in the resonant inductor Lr must be greater than 
the energy stored in the resonant capacitor Cr.

Mode 6 (t5<t<t6): This mode starts at time t5 when vCr=0 
and the anti-parallel diode of Q is turned on and ends at 
time t6 when the main switch Q is turned on. The 
rectifier diodes at the secondary side are still turned on. 
The magnetizing inductor voltage vLm=nvo. The 
magnetizing inductor current iLm increases. The inductor 
voltage vLr=vC1+nvo>0 so that the inductor current iLr 
increases in this mode. Since vL1>0 and vL2<0, the 
inductor current iL1 increases and iL2 decreases in this 
mode. The diode currents iD1 and iD2 decrease. Before the 
switch current iQ=iL1+iLr is positive, the main switch Q 
should be turned on to achieve ZVS. This mode ends at 
time t6 when the main switch Q is turned on. 
Mode 7 (t6<t<t0): This mode starts at time t6 when 
switch Q is turned on. The circuit analysis in this mode is 
almost the same as the circuit analysis in the mode 6. The 
main switch current iQ increases from negative to 
positive value. The secondary side current iC2 increases 
from negative to positive value and the diode currents iD1 
and iD2 decrease to zero. This mode ends at time t0 when 
the diode currents iD1=iD2=0. The circuit goes to the 
operation mode 1 to begin the next switching cycle. 
4. Steady State Analysis 
Based on the key waveforms shown in Fig. 2, the 
delay time between two switches Q and Qa at modes 2, 3, 
5 and 6 is neglected and the voltages on the capacitors Cc, 
C1 and C2 are constant. These assumptions are made to 
obtain the average voltages on the capacitors C1, C2 , Cc 
and Co. When the main switch Q is turned on and the 
auxiliary switch Qa is turned off in mode 1, the input and 
output inductor voltages vL1=Vin and vL2≈ VC1/n+VC2-Vo. 
The voltage across the inductors Lr and Lm equals -VC1 
and the secondary side voltage Vs1=-VC1/n. In mode 4, 
the input and output inductor voltages vL1=Vin-VC1-VCc 
and vL2=-Vo. The voltage across the inductors Lr and Lm 
equals VCc and the secondary side voltage Vs1=-Vo=-VC2. 
In mode 7, the input and output inductor voltages vL1=Vin 
and vL2=-Vo. The voltage across the inductors Lr and Lm 
equals -VC1 and the secondary side voltage Vs1=-Vo=-VC2. 
In steady state analysis, the voltage-second product 
across the input inductor when the main switch Q or the 
anti-parallel body diode of Q is turned on should equal 
the voltage-second product when the main switch Q and 
the anti-parallel body diode of Q are turned off. 
VinDT=(VC1+VCc-Vin)(1-D)T   (12) 
where D is the duty cycle of the main switch Q and Vin, 
VC1 and VCc are average voltage value of input voltage 
and capacitors C1 and Cc, respectively. Based on the 
voltage-second balance on the output inductor L2, one 
can obtain the following equation.

where Dloss=t0/T is the duty cycle loss of the converter in 
mode 7. For the voltage-second balance on the primary 
and secondary side of transformer, the following 
equations can be obtained.

If the duty cycle D is less than 0.5, the clamp capacitor 
voltage VCc<Vin. If the duty cycle D is greater than 0.5, 
the clamp voltage VCc>Vin. Therefore, the voltage on the 
clamp capacitor Cc is operated as a buck-boost type of 
 shows the experimental results of drain voltages vQ,ds and 
vQa,ds, clamp capacitor voltage vCc and capacitor voltage 
vC1. In Fig. 1(d), one can see that vQ,ds+vQa,ds=vCc+vC1. If 
the main switch Q is turned off and auxiliary switch Qa is 
turned on, then vQ,ds=vCc+vC1 and vQa,ds=0. If the main 
switch Q is turned on and auxiliary switch Qa is turned 
off, then vQ,ds=0 and vQa,ds=vCc+vC1. The  clamp 
capacitor voltage vCc and capacitor voltage vC1 are  
almost  constant in each switching cycle. Fig. 6(b) 
shows the measured waveforms of gate voltage vQ,gs, 
input inductor current iL1, switch current iQ and capacitor 
current iC1. When main switch Q is turned on, the switch 
current iQ equals input inductor current iL1 and capacitor 
current iC1. When main switch Q is turned off, switch 
current iQ=0 and capacitor current iC1=-iL1. Fig. 6(c) 
illustrates the measured results of the gate voltage vQ,gs, 
capacitor current iC1, resonant current iLr and auxiliary 
switch current iQa. When main switch Q is turned on, the 
auxiliary switch current iQa=0 and capacitor current iC1 
equals the resonant inductor current iLr. When main 
switch Q is turned off and auxiliary switch Qa is turned 
on, then iLr+iQa=iC1. Fig. 6(d) gives the measured 
waveforms of gate voltage vQ,gs, inductor current iLr, and 
the secondary and third winding currents iD1 and iC2. 
When main switch Q is turned on, the inductor current iLr 
and the third winding current iC2 increase from negative 
value to positive value, and the secondary winding 
current iD1 decreases from positive value to zero. When 
main switch Q is turned off, the  inductor current iLr and 
the third winding current iC2 decrease from positive value 
to negative value, and the secondary winding current iD1 
increases from zero to positive value. Fig. 6(e) gives the 
measured waveforms of gate voltage vQ,gs, the third 
winding current iC2, diode current iD2 and inductor 
current iL2. When main switch Q is turned on in mode 1, 
the diode current iD2 equals zero and output inductor 
current iL2 equals the third winding current iC2. When 
main switch Q is turned off in mode 4, the output 
inductor current iL2 equals the capacitor current iC2 and 
diode current iD2.

7. Conclusion 
 This paper presents the system analysis, operation 
principle and design consideration of a ZVS Sepic-Cuk 
converter with an active snubber. Active snubber circuit 
is used to limit the peak voltage stress of main switch. In 
the proposed converter, the primary side circuit 
components are the same as the primary side circuit 
components of Sepic converter and Cuk converter. The 
secondary side circuit components in the proposed 
converter are parallel-connected of the secondary sides 
of Sepic and Cuk converters to share the load current. 
The Sepic converter and active snubber circuit can 
achieve the magnetizing flux reset when main switch Q 
is turned off. The advantages of the proposed converter 
are low switching losses and low voltage stress on the 
switches and load current sharing.

ABSTRACT—A bidirectional ZVS dc-dc converter with active 
clamp topology is proposed. The proposed converter is based 
on the forward converter with center-tapped rectifier at the 
transformer secondary side. Active clamp topology is used in 
the forward converter to achieve ZVS feature of power 
switches and to regulate the output voltage at the desired 
value. The proposed converter has the advantages of high 
efficiency and simple circuit configuration. The operating 
principle, system analysis and design example are described 
and discussed in detail. Finally, the experimental results of 
the proposed converter are provided to verify the theoretical 
analysis. 
2. Introduction 
The environmental pollution and renewable energy 
issues have been concerned for most of industrial 
countries and researchers. The energy saving techniques 
based on fuel cell technology and power electronics have 
been grown attention in recent years. However, the 
drawback of fuel cells is slow dynamic response due to 
the natural electrochemical reactions [1-2]. The electrical 
output power will not be matched during the transient 
interval. Therefore, bidirectional energy storage is 
required to balance the power difference. In electric 
vehicle applications [3-4], the lead-acid battery is served 
as an energy storage device for its fast response time to 
reduce the power difference between the load demand and 
the available fuel cell generation. The bidirectional 
half-bridge or full-bridge converters [5-8] placed between 
the low voltage battery and the high voltage bus are used 
to transfer the electric energy between low voltage energy 
storage and high voltage drive system. However, there is 
large free wheel current in the full-bridge converters. The 
other drawbacks of bidirectional full-bridge converters 
are high cost, large size and complicated configuration. 
To increase the converter efficiency, the bidirectional 
dc-dc converters with the zero voltage switching (ZVS) 
and zero current switching (ZCS) techniques are proposed 
in [9-11]. However, the control schemes to achieve soft 
switching features are complicated. 
 In this paper, a new bidirectional dc-dc converter 
with asymmetrical PWM scheme is presented to achieve 
bidirectional power flow and ZVS feature. The 
advantages of the proposed converter are high efficiency, 
simple circuit configuration and easy implementation. 
The asymmetrical PWM scheme can help the switches at 
the high voltage bus to turn on at ZVS. The operation 
principle and system analysis of the proposed 
bidirectional converter are discussed in detail. Next, a 
design example is presented. Finally, experimental results 
based on a laboratory prototype were provided to 
demonstrate the performance of the proposed converter. 
 
Fig. 1 Proposed bidirectional ZVS dc-dc converter. 
2. System Analysis 
Fig. 1 shows the circuit configuration of the proposed 
bidirectional ZVS dc-dc converter. In the proposed 
converter, forward converter including vHV, Lm, S1 and 
transformer is used in the high voltage side and a 
center-tapped synchronous rectifier including transformer, 
L, S3, S4 and vLV is used in the low voltage side. Active 
clamp circuit including S2, Cr2 and Cc are used to reduce 
the voltage stress of switch S1 and achieve flux reset of 
transformer. The switches S1 and S2 can be turned on at 
ZVS during the transition interval between S1 and S2. 
When power flows from high voltage side to low voltage 
side, the proposed converter is operated in the buck mode 
to charge the low voltage battery or low voltage load. On 
the other hand, the converter is operated in the boost 
mode when power flows from low voltage side vLV to 
high voltage side vHV. The gate signals of switches S1 and 
S2 in the high voltage side are complementary each other. 
Similarly, the gate signals of S3 and S4 in the low voltage 
side are also complementary each other. 
3. Buck Mode Operation 
If the proposed converter is operated in buck mode, the 
power transfer is from high voltage side vHV to low 
voltage side vLV. The lead-acid battery can be used as the 
energy storage in the low voltage side. The center-tapped 
rectifier with synchronous rectification is adopted to 
regulate voltage vLV. Before the system analysis of the 
proposed converter, some assumptions are made: (1) 
Capacitance of clamp capacitor Cc is large enough so that 
the capacitor voltage vCc is a constant value; (2)

Mode 7 (t6<t<t7): This mode starts at time t6 when 
vCr1=vHV and vCr2=vCc. In the secondary side of 
transformer, synchronous switch S4 is in the on state and 
the anti-parallel diode D3 of synchronous switch S3 is 
turned on to commutate the inductor current iL. Therefore, 
synchronous switch S3 can be turned on at ZVS. In this 
mode, i3 increases and i4 decreases. The resonant tank in 
this mode includes the resonant inductance Lr and the 
resonant capacitance 2Cr. To ensure ZVS operation of S1, 
the condition vHV<|iLr(t6)Z2| must be fulfilled. In this 
mode, synchronous switch S4 can be turned off at ZVS. 
At time t7, vCr1=0 and vCr2=vHV+vCc. The anti-parallel 
diode of S1 is turned on to conduct the negative switch 
current iS1.  
Mode 8 (t7<t<t0): This mode starts at time t7 when the 
anti-parallel diode of switch S1 is turned on. Since iLr is 
negative in this mode, switch S1 can be turned on at ZVS. 
In the secondary side, S3 and D4 are turned on to achieve 
inductor current commutation. In this mode, i3 increases 
and i4 decreases. The inductor voltage vLr=vHV>0 so that 
iLr increases linearly. This mode ends at time t0 when 
i4=0. Then, the circuit operation is back to mode 1 for 
next switching cycle. 
 The time intervals in modes 2-4 and 6-8 are very 
short to be neglected in the steady state analysis. Thus, 
only modes 1 and 5 are used to derive the voltage 
transfer ratio of the proposed bidirectional dc/dc 
converter in buck mode operation. In mode 1, the voltage 
across the inductor Lr and the magnetizing inductor Lm is 
vHV. The voltage across the inductor L is approximately 
equal to vHV/n-vLV. In mode 5, S2 and S4 are turned on 
and the voltage across Lr and Lm is –vCc. The voltage 
across the inductor L is approximately equal to vCc/n-vLV. 
Based on the voltage-second balance across Lr and Lm, 
one can obtain the clamp capacitor voltage as:  
vCc=DvHV /(1-D)   (1) 
where D is the duty ratio of switch S1. Based on the 
voltage-second balance for the inductor L, we can obtain 
the output voltage equation.

Therefore, the voltage transfer ratio of the proposed 
converter in buck mode operation is Mbuck=vLV/vHV=2D/n.

Abstract- This paper presents the system analysis and 
circuit implementation of a soft switching converter based on 
buck-flyback topology to have a large voltage step-down 
between the output and input sides. Compared with the 
conventional buck converter, the proposed converter has 
wide turn-on period so that the lower output voltage can be 
achieved. An active snubber circuit is connected in parallel 
with the main switch to achieve zero voltage switching (ZVS). 
The resonance is based on the output capacitance of power 
switch and resonant inductance at the transition interval 
between the main and auxiliary switches. Therefore, the 
turn-on switching losses of power switch are reduced. The 
circuit configuration, system analysis, and design 
consideration of the proposed converter are presented in 
detail. Finally, experimental results based on a laboratory 
prototype with 240W rated power are provided to verify the 
effectiveness of the proposed converter.  
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Recently the high performance converters with large 
voltage step-down conversion for microprocessor 
applications have been widely studied. The large 
step-down conversion can be easily implemented with the 
isolated transformer. However, if the isolation is not 
required, a converter without transformer is not easily 
realized by the conventional buck converter. The main 
drawbacks of buck converter with high step-down feature 
are high switching loss and extremely narrow duty cycle. 
To obtain high step-up conversion ratio, the cascade boost 
converters and coupled-inductor converters [1-5] have 
been proposed for non-isolated applications. These 
converters may overcome the drawback of conventional 
boost converter in high voltage gain applications. The 
high step-down buck converters are presented in [6-9]. 
With the selection of the turn-ratio of coupled-inductor, a 
large step-down conversion can be easily derived. 
However, the switching losses of switches are still high 
enough. The passive or active snubber [10-12] should be 
necessary for reducing the voltage surge of switch to 
improve the converter efficiency. 
A soft switching converter with wide duty cycle 
operation is presented in this paper. In the proposed 
converter, buck and flyback converters with only one 
power switch are adopted to achieve step-down 
conversion. An active snubber is used in the proposed 
converter to realize the zero voltage switching (ZVS) for 
main and auxiliary switches. The voltage stress of main 
switch can be effectively limited by the active snubber. 
Therefore, low voltage stress of power switches with low 
Rds,on is used to reduce the conduction loss. The circuit 
configuration, operational principle, steady state analysis 
and design consideration of the proposed converter are 
presented in detail. Finally, experimental results based on 
a laboratory prototype rated at 240W are presented to 
demonstrate the circuit performance and to verify the 
feasibility of the proposed converter. 
 
Fig. 1. Proposed soft switching converter. 
II. Circuit Configuration 
Fig. 1 gives the circuit configuration of the proposed 
ZVS converter. The proposed circuit consists of two 
converters in series: flyback converter and buck converter. 
In the conventional series-connected buck and flyback 
converters, there are two power switches to be controlled. 
The main drawbacks of this circuit topology are too many 
circuit components and complex control scheme for 
output voltage regulation. In the proposed converter, only 
one switch is controlled for buck and flyback converters. 
The circuit components vin, L1, Q, C1 and D1 are operated 
as a flyback (buck-boost) converter with vC1/vin=D/(1-D) 
where D is the duty cycle of Q. The circuit components of 
buck converter include C1, Q, D2, D3, L2 and Co. The 
voltage conversion of the buck converter is vo/vC1=D. 
Therefore, the total conversion ratio between output and 
input voltages is vo/vin=D2/(1-D). In order to reduce the 
switching losses on switch Q, an active snubber circuit 
including clamp capacitor Cc, active switch Qa and 
resonant inductor Lr is used in the circuit to create a 
resonance so that switches Q and Qa can be turned on at 
ZVS. Compared with the conventional buck converter, the 
proposed converter has wide turn-on period of switch Q. 
The gate signals of main switch Q and auxiliary switch Qa 
 current iLr flows through the anti-parallel diode of switch 
Qa. 
Mode 4 [t3<t<t4]: When vCr=vCc at time t3, the inductor 
current iLr flows through the anti-parallel diode of switch 
Qa. Since D2 and D3 are still in the commutation interval, 
the inductor voltage vL2 equals –vo and the inductor 
voltage vLr=vC1-vCc<0. Therefore, the inductor currents iL2 
and iLr decrease. The switch Qa is turn on in this mode to 
achieve ZVS. This mode ends at time t4 when the diode 
current iD2=0 and the diode D1 is turned on. 
Mode 5 [t4<t<t5]: When the diode current iD2=0 at time t4, 
the current iL1-iLr is positive and flows through diode D1. 
Since vL1=-vC1 and vL2=-vo, the inductor currents iL1 and 
iL2 decrease and can be expressed as:

Since the clamp capacitor Cc is large enough to consider 
as a constant voltage, the inductor current iLr can be 
expressed as:

where vin+vC1-vCc<0. The inductor current iLr decreases 
from positive value to negative value. This mode ends at 
time t5 when auxiliary switch Qa is turned off. 
Mode 6 [t5<t<t6]: This mode starts at time t5 when switch 
Qa is turned off. The output diode D3 is still on in this 
mode. The inductor current iLr discharges the capacitor Cr 
from vCc to zero voltage in this mode. In this mode, the 
resonant components include the inductor Lr and capacitor 
Cr. The inductor current iLr and capacitor voltage vCr are 
expressed as:

The inductor currents iL1 and iL2 decrease in this mode. To 
achieve ZVS turn-on for main switch Q, the capacitor 
voltage vCr should reach zero before the end of this mode. 
Therefore, the energy stored in the resonant inductor Lr 
must be greater than the energy stored in the resonant 
capacitor Cr.

When capacitor voltage vCr=0 at time t6, the anti-parallel 
diode of main switch Q is turned on. 
Mode 7 [t6<t<t7]: This mode starts at time t6 when 
capacitor voltage vCr=0 and the anti-parallel diode of main 
switch Q is turned on. Since the diodes D1 and D3 are still 
on, the inductor currents iL1 and iL2 decrease in this mode. 
The inductor voltage vLr=vin+vC1>0 so that the inductor 
current iLr increases from negative to positive value.

Before the switch current iQ is positive, switch Q should 
be turned on to achieve ZVS. This mode ends at time t7 
when the diode current iD1 is zero and diode D2 is turned 
on to commutate the output inductor current iL2. 
Mode 8 [t7<t<T+t0]: This mode starts at time t7 when 
diode D1 is turned off and diodes D2 and D3 are in the 
commutation mode. In this mode, the inductor voltages 
vL2=-vo and vLr=vC1 so that the output inductor current iL2 
decreases and inductor current iLr increases. The diode 
current iD2 increases and the diode current iD3 decreases. 
This mode ends at time T+t0 when the diode current iD3 is 
zero. Then, the operation behavior of the proposed 
converter in one switching period is completed 
The capacitor Cr is charged quickly in modes 2 and 3, 
and Cr is discharged quickly in mode 6. We can neglect 
these modes to simply the steady state analysis. In mode 1, 
the inductor voltages vL1+vLr=vin and vL2=vC1-vo. In mode 
4, the inductor voltages vL1+vLr=vin-vCc and vL2=-vo. In 
mode 5, the inductor voltages vL1=-vC1, vLr=vin+vC1-vCc 
and vL2=-vo. In mode 7, the inductor voltages vL1=-vC1, 
vLr=vin+vC1 and vL2=-vo. In mode 8, the inductor voltages 
vL1+vLr=vin and vL2=-vo. Based on the voltage-second 
balance on inductors L1, Lr and L2, we can obtain the 
following equations.

of diode D1, and DL,8=(T+t0-t8)/T is the duty cycle loss in 
mode 8 due to the commutation of diodes D2 and D3. If 
the fast recovery diodes are used in the converter, then

equation meets the theoretical output voltage equation in 
the series connection of flyback and buck converters.

where η is the circuit efficiency. If DL,4, DL,7, DL,8<<D and

8 to simplify the circuit design. The maximum duty cycle 
of the main switch Q at minimum input voltage is  
 connected in parallel with the input inductor as shown in 
Fig. 7. The operation behavior of this circuit topology is 
almost the same as that in Fig. 1. The only difference is 
the voltage stress on the clamp capacitor Cc. The capacitor 
voltage vCc=vin/(1-D) in Fig. 1 and vCc=vinD/(1-D) in Fig. 
7. Therefore, the clamp capacitor Cc shown in Fig. 7 has 
less voltage stress.

configuration, operation principle and design 
consideration are demonstrated as well. Finally the
