improvements in the quality of video 
communications by providing unequal error protection to H.264 
data. To investigate the wireless multimedia communications in 
correlated fading channels, we study the approach to generate bit 
error process in correlated mobile fading channels. The approach 
need to be capable of generating bit error processes that fit the 
targeted physical settings in the mobile scenario, e.g., the 
modulation scheme, the carrier frequency, and speeds. One 
requirement of this approach is to preserve the correlation endowed 
by the mobile fading 
channels. The approach needs to generate the correlated bit error 
processes without having to implement the channel generator and 
modulation/demodulation scheme. Our results show effectiveness 
and verify the feasibility of our proposed concepts. 
 
Unequal Error Protection for OFDM Systems in
Time-varying Channels

Abstract—Time-varying channel causes intercarrier interfer-
ence (ICI) and impairs the orthogonality among subcarriers
in wireless mobile Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) systems. The ICI and loss of carrier orthogonality de-
grade the bit error rate (BER), and thus results in intolerable loss
of quality especially in applying multimedia data transmission. In
this paper, we propose an unequal density of pilot placement for
OFDM systems in time-varying channel, which provides Unequal
Error Protection (UEP) for important multimedia transmission.
A dynamic image data assignment (DIDA) scheme for UEP
utilizing visual saliency is presented to reallocate image data
in OFDM symbol for the UEP transmission. Simulation results
show substantial improvements of quality in the region of interest
in the image by using proposed method.
I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has
been adopted in many high data rate wireless transmission
standard, such as digital audio broadcasting (DAB) and digital
video broadcasting (DVB-T). The OFDM system has the
advantage of high bandwidth efficiency and capability to
eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) by inserting cyclic
prefix (CP) between successive OFDM symbols. In practical
transmission environment, however, the multipath channel is
time-varying and destroys the orthogonality among subcarriers
as intercarrier interference (ICI) ( [1], [2], and [3]). This results
in the floor in bit error rate (BER) and poor transmission
quality of service (QoS).
To improve the quality in multimedia transmission systems,
the use of Unequal Error Protection (UEP) schemes has
been proposed in recent years. The rationale of UEP is to
provide variant resource allocation procedure corresponding
to variant importance degree of information content. In [4],
[5] multimedia data are rearranged to subchannels accord-
ing to the feedback information of channel estimation from
the receivers. Houas et al. [6] assigned multimedia data of
high error sensitive degree to the best subcarriers by further
joint considerations in optimizing the source rate and symbol
payload. A power reallocation scheme combined with LDPC
coding was proposed in [7] to protect important bits in video
stream. Tsuchiya et al. [8] presented multiplexed modulations
transmission mechanism, where the UEP effect is attained by
switching the demodulation scheme at the receiver. Among the
previous works, assumptions on reliable feedback information
from receivers are required, which remains to be improved

in practical wireless systems. Besides, coding or multiplexed
modulations also impose extra cost in complexity.
In this paper, we proposed a channel estimation scheme with
unequal density of pilot placement to support reliable quality
for important content in the image. The image is processed by
Saliency Toolbox [9]. The visual saliency algorithm generates
region of interest, not necessarily containing objects. A sys-
tematic window process is applied to segment these regions.
The UEP is attained by placing data among parts of various
pilot density in the OFDM symbol according to the importance
degree of the regions in the image.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we present the OFDM system model and propose a channel
estimation method with unequal pilot placement to protect
multimedia data of high importance or interests. A dynamic
image data assignment (DIDA) scheme for UEP is described
in Section III. Simulations are provided in Section IV. Finally,
conclusions are drawn in Section V.
II. OFDM SYSTEM MODEL
A. Signal and Channel Models
We consider an OFDM system with N subcarriers. The
subcarrier separation is ∆f , thus we have the sample interval
of the OFDM system as Ts = 1/N∆f . The CP of length
lp is adopted in the OFDM system and assumed longer than
the channel delay spread L, which is required in processing
ISI within all OFDM symbols. Let X = [X0 X1 ... XN−1]T
denote the frequency domain modulated data sequence in
an OFDM symbol, where superscript (·)T is the transpose
operator. The frequency domain symbol after applying N-
point inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) and adding
CP in the time domain is thus transmitted and represented as
x[n] = 1√
N
∑N−1
k=0 Xkej2πkn/N , for n = 0, 1, ..., N − 1 and
x[n] = x[N + n], for n = −lp, ...,−1. At the receiver, after
the transmitted signal passes through time-varying channel and
the CP is discarded, the received signal can be expressed as
y[n] =
L−1∑
l=0
h[n, l]x[n− l] + w[n], 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1 (1)
,where h[n, l] is the discrete time time-varying channel im-
pulse response of l-th path at n-th sample time interval, w[n]
is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean
and variance N0. The received OFDM symbol is transferred to
frequency domain data sequence by discrete Fourier transform

comprising important information are extended to windows
separately, and the proportion of the number of pixels inside
those windows to those of outside is the same as the proportion
of number of data placed in the dense part of the OFDM
symbol to that in the rare part. Proper window procession will
assign more abundant important data in a limited number of
pixels. Besides, information data inside those regions can be
efficiently segmented and recovered by windows for its ease
in description by two coordinates. In the following section,
we would demonstrate the algorithm of window procession to
attain this end.
B. Window Process
1) Initialization: Compact Window: Before we start to ma-
nipulate a proper window to cover the salient region reported
by Saliency Toolbox, the number of pixels required for each
specified window is first calculated by
Pγ =
⌊
PT
(
ND
ND +NR
)(
Ψγ∑Λ−1
λ=0 Ψλ
)⌋
, γ = 0, 1, ...,Λ−1
(9)
,where ⌊·⌋ represents floor, Pγ is the number of assigned pixels
in the γ-th irregular region, PT is the number of total pixels in
the image, ND and NR represent the number of information
data on the subcarrier of dense part and that on the rare part,
respectively. Ψγ is the area, measured by number of pixels, of
the γ-th irregular region initially afforded by Saliency Toolbox
and with single salient point Wγ of coordinates
(
Wγx ,Wγy
)
inside. Λ is the number of regions that we desire to construct
windows to maintain relative good quality. Then, we do
window procession sequentially according to the generating
order of salient regions.
We start with the smallest square area of size hγ0 × vγ0 to
cover the irregular region Ψγ , where γ0 denotes initial state for
the following iterations of window procession on γ-th irregular
region. The side-length is defined as
hγ0 , rγ0 + lγ0 + 1,
vγ0 , uγ0 + dγ0 + 1
,where uγ0 , dγ0 , rγ0 , and lγ0 are expansions of sub-divisions
Uγ0 , Dγ0 , Rγ0 , and Lγ0 , respectively, which are defined as
Uγ0=
{(
Uγ0xn
,Uγ0yn
)
| Wγy<Uγ0yn ≤Wγy+uγ0 ,
Wγx−lγ0≤Uγ0xn ≤Wγx+rγ0
}
,
Dγ0=
{(
Dγ0xn
,Dγ0yn
)
| Wγy−dγ0≤Dγ0yn <Wγy ,
Wγx−lγ0≤Dγ0xn ≤Wγx+rγ0
}
,
Rγ0=
{(
Rγ0xn
,Rγ0yn
)
| Wγx<Rγ0xn ≤Wγx+rγ0 ,
Wγy−dγ0≤Rγ0yn ≤Wγy+uγ0
}
,
Lγ0=
{(
Lγ0xn
,Lγ0yn
)
| Wγx−lγ0≤Lγ0xn<Wγx ,
Wγy−dγ0≤Lγ0yn ≤Wγy+uγ0
}
,
(uγ0 , dγ0 , rγ0 , lγ0) =
argmin
Ψγ⊆Uγ0∪Dγ0∪Rγ0∪Lγ0
(hγ0 · vγ0 − Ψγ) (10)
As a result, Uγ0 ∪ Dγ0 ∪ Rγ0 ∪ Lγ0 contributes to the
compact window that covers Ψγ . If the number of pixels
inside the compact window equals to the assigned one, i.e.,
Pγ0 , hγ0 · vγ0 = Pγ , and there is no overlapping on other
windows, this window procession is trivially done. If not,
further computation required to evaluate which orientation to
extend (when Pγ0 < Pγ) or to reduce (when Pγ0 > Pγ or
overlapping exists) the side-length.
2) Side-length Extension: When Pγ0 < Pγ , reasonable
regulation on expansion in each direction would enhance the
efficiency in transmitting expected information data. To decide
the side-length should extend to which orientation, we evaluate
by comparing the proportion of information content among
four sub-divisions as
AUγ0
=
NUγ0
hγ0 · uγ0
,ADγ0
=
NDγ0
hγ0 · dγ0
,ARγ0
=
NRγ0
vγ0 · rγ0
,ALγ0
=
NLγ0
vγ0 · lγ0(11)
,where NSγ̟ denotes the number of pixels that belong to Ψγ
and is inside the square sub-division Sγ̟ , Sγ̟ = Uγ̟ , Dγ̟ ,
Rγ̟ , or Lγ̟ . Hence, we extend the side-length along the
direction of maximum proportion as
κ(Sγ̟+1) =

κ (Sγ̟) + 1 , if Sγ̟ = Γγ̟ ;
if Γγ̟ \ Sγ̟ 6= φ, choose
Sγ̟ such that NSγ̟ is max.
κ (Sγ̟) , otherwise (12)
consider an OFDM system with subcarriers N = 256, and the
CP length lp = N/4 samples. QPSK constellation is applied in
signaling. The pilot assignment is the same as that illustrated

Fig. 5. BER performance comparison for UEP procession and general
uniform pilot placement of the OFDM symbol
in Fig.1 and Fig.2, and the number of total pilots, including
head, medium, and tail parts, is 58. The time-varying multipath
channel is generated by Jakes’ model and assumed to be with
exponential decay power profile. In our simulation, we test
our algorithms in different delay spread length L = 3 or L =
12, and under different time-varying schemes as normalized
Doppler frequency fd = 0.01 or fd = 0.2 respectively.
In the demonstration with image of size 481 × 321 (we
use the image in the dataset of [10]), the image is directly
transmitted in bits composed of RGB. The number of windows
to cover salient regions is specified as 4. Information data

Fig. 6. Original image with specified regions computed by DIDA scheme
inside windows are placed on subcarriers among the dense
pilot placement of the OFDM symbol, while others are placed
in the rare part. When the transmission of the image is
completed by multiple OFDM symbols, the receiver starts
to reintegrate the image. We assume that the coordinates of
salient points and corresponding expansion information can
be perfectly received at the receiver.
Fig.4 shows the BER performance comparison for the dense
part and the rare part of the OFDM symbol. The BER
performance of the dense part demonstrate great enhancement
relative to the rare part, which guarantee that important
contents suffer less impairment even under sever wireless
environment.
Fig.5 shows the BER performance comparison for UEP
procession and general uniform pilot placement of the OFDM
symbol. Our UEP mechanism shows at least 5 dB improve-
ment than the uniform placement, making the recognition on
image at the receiver more possible and reliable.
Fig.6 presents the DIDA scheme. Red asterisks are salient
points, and connected by red line according to the generating
sequence. The irregular regions surrounded with yellow line
are generated by Saliency Toolbox as attended regions; win-
dows of green edges and circles at corners in the image are
compact window that cover irregular regions. Windows of blue
edges and triangles at corners are specified by our algorithm.
Fig.7(a) and (b) compare the UEP scheme and general
uniform pilot placement scheme with the same image. Images
are transmitted through time-varying channel with fd = 0.2,
L = 12, and SNR = 25 dB, and then reconstructed at the
receiver according to the corresponding schemes, respectively.
It shows that our algorithm maintains detailed content inside
the expected regions and has better perceptual quality.
