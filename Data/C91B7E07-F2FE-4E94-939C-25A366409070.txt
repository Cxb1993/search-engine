A bidirectional CWDM-PON system that covers a wide wavelength of 1.3 and 1.5 μm
with an aggregated data rate of 40 Gb/s is proposed and demonstrated. Four uncooled
direct-modulated distributed feedback lasers (DFB-LDs) with wavelengths of 1275,
1300, 1325, and 1350 nm are adopted for the upstream transmission to lower the
installation cost and dispersion effect. Another four external-modulated lasers
by a LiNbO3 modulator with wavelengths of 1510, 1530, 1550, and 1570 nm are deployed
for the downstream transmission to minimize the chirp effect. These lasers are
operated at 10 Gb/s simultaneously for transmission over 20 km of standard
single-mode fiber (SMF). Downstream and upstream data of high capacity are operated
at 10 Gb/s per channel simultaneously. Moreover, we discussed the impact of fiber
chromatic dispersion on this system’s performance at 10 Gb/s over a wide range
of dispersion. For the dispersion range of -3.511 to 2.974 ps/nm·km, negative power
penalties have been observed due to the pulse compression effect, which is resulted
from a low chirp of DFB-LDs. We evaluated 10 Gb/s direct-modulated DFB-LDs’
wavelengths from 1275 to 1350 nm of power penalties versus a transmissible SMF
distance. The calculated power penalties are less than 0.6 dB for 40 km SMF
transmission. This CWDM-PON system enables the maximum subscribing bit rate to 10
Gb/s for a client and the maximum splitting ratio of up to 1:32. Therefore, this
bidirectional CWDM-PON system can meet with the high subscribing bandwidth and the
flexible requirements of next level of fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) access networks.

The other sections of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 describes
the proposed CWDM-PON architecture and experimental setup. The measured results
of the CWDM-PON for downstream and upstream characteristics are presented in
Section 3. Section 4 has discussed characteristics that chromatic dispersion of
1.5 μm externally modulated lasers, and the power penalties of directly modulated
lasers due to LD chirp with 10 Gb/s in a limited distance of 1.3 μm DFB-LDs for
SMF transmission. A brief conclusion is given in the final Section 5.
2. The CWDM-PON architecture and experimental setup
2.1 The proposed CWDM-PON architecture
The proposed architecture of 40 Gb/s bidirectional CWDM-PON is shown in Fig. 1.
The wavelength tolerance is ±10 nm for each channel of the CWDM network and this
design will greatly reduce the cost of the system. The system of Fig. 1 can be divided
into three parts the center office side, the remote node, and the client side. The
center office side contains four downstream transmitters, four upstream receivers,
a 4-channel multiplexer, a 4-channel demultiplexer and a 13xx/15xx nm WDM coupler.
An External modulation technique is adopted for the downstream transmission to
minimize the dispersion effect in the SMF. The remote node comprehends the
demultiplexer of the downstream channels, the multiplexer of the upstream channels,
and the splitting network to the client side. A 4-channel multiplexer, a 4-channel
demultiplexer, and five 13xx/15xx nm WDM couplers are needed in the remote node.
By using the thin-film filter technology, the cost of these multiplexers,
demultiplexers, and WDM couplers is low. The insertion loss of each channel at the
remote node can be controlled easily at 2 to 3 dB with commercial products. A 1:32
optical splitter is installed at the end of each channel. The client side is
basically operated by a 10 Gb/s bidirectional optical transceiver. A 10 Gb/s
directly modulated distributed feedback laser diode (DFB-LD) is built into the
optical transceiver to transmit the upstream signal [12].
In comparison with the conventional PON networks, the system of Fig. 1 adopts
the bit rate of the time division multiplexing (TDM) transmission from a gigabit
up to 10 Gb/s and increases the aggregated data rate 4 times to 40 Gb/s by using
a cost-effective CWDM technique. The benefits include the larger bandwidth and the
flexibility of adjusting the maximum bit rate of a client to 10 Gb/s.
2.2 The experimental setup of CWDM-PON system
We illustrated the arrangement of the experimental setup. A schematic diagram
of the measured system is shown in Fig. 2. Four 1.5 μm tunable lasers with the
desired wavelength were mutiplexed by an CWDM multiplexer and modulated by a LiNbO3
modulator with 10 Gb/s NRZ data to simulate the downstream transmission. Four
10-Gb/s directly modulated DFB-LDs with wavelength from 1275 to 1350 nm at an
interval of 25 nm were connected with the CWDM multiplexer to simulate the upstream
transmission. These DFB-LDs were simultaneously driven by a 10 Gb/s NRZ data
pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) with the pattern length of 231-1 via a 1:4
the jitters were from 11.2 to 23.6 psec. The received and reshaped eye patterns
after a 20-km SMF transmission by a homemade APD-TIA receiver are shown in Fig.
5(b). The measured eye pattern maintained at a clearly open figure and could ensure
a good transmission. Values of the optical power, OC-192 eye mask margin, and the
jitters for every channel are summarized in Table 1.
The optical sensitivity was measured by connecting the output port of the CWDM
demultiplexer with a variable optical attenuator and a homemade optical receiver,
as shown in Fig. 6. As summarized in Table 2, the BTB receiving sensitivity of
upstream channels distributed from -18.20 to -18.42 dBm. The receiving
sensitivities of longer wavelength channels were better than shorter wavelengths
due to a higher quantum efficiency of the photodiode used in the homemade optical
receiver. The received sensitivity after a 20 km SMF transmission was from -17.68
to -18.73 dBm. The power penalty was only several tenth of a dB for all four channels
and was slightly larger than the downstream channels due to the direct modulation
scheme. This is due to a larger dispersion of optical fiber from the larger spectral
bandwidth of direct modulation sources. On the other hand, although the dispersion
coefficient is larger at the longer wavelengths, since the downstream signal is
external modulated, so the dispersion is smaller and the results of a neglible power
penalty compared with upstream signals. In addition, the total optical power loss
of the upstream path in this experimental setup is 12.41, 12.24, 11.22, and 12.84
dB for the wavelengths of 1275, 1300, 1325, 1350 nm, respectively. With –19 dBm
APD-TIA receiver sensitivity to ensure an error-free operation in the practical
systems, 3.24 dBm average modulated laser power gives rise to a power budget of
10 dB, which allows transmission over 20 km of standard SMF without optical
amplifiers. In our elementary experiment, the power budget was about 9 dB and was
adequate to afford a ratio of 1:8 splitting network. Although the dispersion
coefficient is larger at the longer wavelengths, since the downstream signal is
externally modulated, the dispersion is smaller and results a neglible power
penalty compared with upstream signals. Furthermore, we have evaluated approximate
power penalties due to LD chirp with 10 Gb/s data rate in DFB-LDs wavelengths from
1275 to 1350 nm for SMF transmission. The computed power penalties of the upstream
channels could match with the measured results. The receiving sensitivity of this
CWDM-PON system could be improved further if the output power of DFB lasers were
increased several dB or a commercial APD-TIA receiver was used. Therefore, it would
be possible to construct the proposed network. The burst mode operation did not
adequate in this experiment due to the limited component performance. Additionally,
we have observed the pulse compression effect which gives rise to a negative
dispersion penalty due to a low chirp of the laser. To get of this effect, the DFB
laser wavelength needs to be properly selected and its range is found to be as wide
as 40 nm for transmission over 20 km standard SMF.
4. Discussion of modulated lasers and transmission characteristics
The power penalty and the transmission distance that externally modulated lasers
The power penalty is estimated by the degradation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
due to the decrease of the signal amplitude and is expressed by the following
equation (3).

where x is the excess noise factor of the APD and is about 0.8 for an InGaAs-APD
optical receiver. The relation between dispersion power penalties and SMF
transmission distances with 10 Gb/s operation for various wavelengths are
calculated and plotted in Fig. 8. It is shown that the dispersion power penalty
is less than 0.6 dB for a 40 km SMF transmission with wavelength distributed from
1275 to 1350 nm. Furthermore, the relation between dispersion power penalties and
operating wavelengths with 10 Gb/s operation and 20 km SMF transmission are
calculated and plotted in Fig. 9. The DFB-LDs linewidths are assumed to be varied
between 0.10 and 0.25 nm. The experimental results of the power penalties with
different wavelengths are shown as solid dots in Fig. 9. The computed power
penalties of the upstream channels matched well with the measured results. Both
the calculated and experimental results confirm that the DFB-LDs with wavelength
range of 1275 nm to 1350 nm at 10 Gb/s operation have neglible power penalties in
this proposed CWDM-PON system.
5. Conclusion
A bidirectional CWDM-PON system with a symmetric 40 Gb/s data rate for 20 km SMF
transmission has been demonstrated. The maximum subscribing bit rate of each client
could be adjusted from a gigabit to 10 Gb/s and the split ratio could reach to 1:128.
Four downstream channels with externally modulated light sources emitting at
wavelengths from 1510 to 1570 nm and four upstream channels with directly modulated
DFB-LD emitting at wavelengths from 1275 to 1350 nm were adopted to minimize the
dispersion effect of SMF transmission. All the downstream and upstream channels
were operated at 10 Gb/s simultaneously to demonstrate the 40 Gb/s fully duplex
transmission. The power penalties of directly modulated DFB-LD are extensively
studied and are confirmed to be neglible in this proposed CWDM-PON system. Although
the dispersion coefficient is larger at the longer wavelengths, since the
downstream signal is external modulated, therefore the dispersion power penalty
is neglible, too. Utilizing the simple low-cost CWDM architecture, the matured 10
Gb/s module technology, moderate transmission distance, and the potential for a
large splitting ratio, this CWDM-PON access network has promising potential
characteristic to apply at the highspeed local-area-networks (LAN) and next
generation FTTH networks.

ABSTRACT
A new 5-pin transistor outline (TO-Can) header for conventional coaxial laser package has been proposed and demonstrated by
using a three-dimensional full-wave electromagnetic simulation tool. The applicability of the simulation tool was verified by a
measurement result of a conventional TO-56 header. By adopting a two-session feed-through via and a bent feed-lead, this TO-Can
header has the optimal impedance for high-speed modulation. The reflection loss can be controlled beneath–10-dB before 15-GHz
with a 50-Ω termination. The 3-dB modulated bandwidth with a load impedance of 5-Ωand 50-Ω is over 23-GHz and 37-GHz,
respectively. This TO-Can header provides a low-cost coaxial laser package solution with widely load impedances from 5-Ω to
50-Ωand may apply in the emerging 100-Gigabits Ethernet (100GbE) and next generation Fiber Channel (20GFC) applications.
Keywords: 100-Gigabits Ethernet, Fiber Channel, 100GbE, 20GFC, TO-Can, coaxial laser package, TOSA
1. INTRODUCTION
Currently, the 100-Gigabits Ethernet (100GbE) network based on four-channel wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
technology has been discussed extensively [1]-[3]. In the same time, the 21-Gb/s Fiber Channel (20GFC) has attracted much
attention and plays an important role in the storage area network. A low cost laser module is very essential for these applications.
Although low-cost 10-Gb/s transmitter optical sub-assembly (TOSA) modules by adopting coaxial TO-Can laser package
technology have been demonstrated [4]-[9], however, these TOSAs have still a limited data rate of 10-Gb/s in common and cannot
be applied in the future 100GbE and 20GFC networks. Nowadays, laser diode (LD) fabrication technology is advanced and the
modulation bandwidth over 20-GHz have been demonstrated [10]-[13], so the limited modulation bandwidth of the TOSA is due to
the low-cost coaxial TO-Can laser package technology. Therefore, breaking the bandwidth limitation and providing a cost effective
approach is very important for future 100GbE and 20GFC networks. In order to analysis the high-frequency characteristics of a
TO-Can structure in details, we construct and calculate the electromagnetic model of a conventional TO-56 header by using the
High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) software. The HFSS software is a three-dimensional (3D) full-wave electromagnetic
simulation tool that takes the 3D geometric structure and material parameters of microwave characteristics into account. To check
the applicability of the simulation approach, the reflection loss (S11) measurement of an opened circuit of a conventional TO-56
header has been implemented. The measured result and the simulated result have good consistency at a frequency up to 20-GHz.
Through the HFSS simulation, an electrical field diagram is presented at high frequency. After a comprehensive study on the TO-56
header, the bottleneck of the limited data rate of a TOSA has been attributed as the impedance variation of the feed-through via and
the feed-lead of the TO-56 header. By optimizing the geometry of the feed-through via and the feed-lead of the TO-Can header, a
new 5-pin TO-Can header with a two-session feed-through via and a bent feed-lead for high-speed modulation is proposed and
demonstrated. This 5-pin TO-Can header has a 3-dB modulated bandwidth over than 24-GHz with different load impedances of 5-Ω
evaluated board and SMA connector in measuring the high-frequency characteristics. By adopting the de-embedded action can
eliminate these influences. Unfortunately, our VNA has not this de-embedded function. In general, the simulated result shows a
good agreement with the measured result in the measuring frequency range of 20-GHz.

3. HIGH-FREQUENCY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FEED-LEAD
Based on the structure of the TO-56 header, as shown in Fig. 1(b), the feed-lead can be divided into three parts and the
high-frequency characteristics are discussed separately. The outside feed-lead (L1) and the inside feed-lead (L3) could be taken as a
cylindrical line. The coaxial feed-lead (L2) and the feed-through via (R) could be considered as a coaxial line [8, 15].
A. Frequency characteristics of the cylindrical line
As increasing the length of the feed-lead, the inductance of the feed-lead is increased. The increased inductance would limit the
bandwidth of the TO-Can header. In order to ensure a maximum bandwidth, feed-lead length should be designed as short as
possible. The parasitic inductance (L) of round lead is expressed as equation (1).

where l and r are the length and the radius of feed-lead, respectively [15]. The length of outside feed-line can be reduced to a
minimum value by adopting a flexible PCB [16]. However, the inductance of inside feed-lead is much complex. The rough
frequency characteristics can be estimated through an equivalent circuit model [8, 15]. However, the advanced frequency
characteristics of the cylindrical line should be calculated by solving the boundary conditions of a 3D electromagnetic wave.
B. Frequency characteristics of the coaxial line.

feed-through via of different diameter is proposed especially. The first-section of the feed-through via (R1) has a radius of 0.48-mm
and is filled with a low dielectric constant sealed glass. The thickness of the first section of the feed-through via is 0.6-mm. The
second-section of feed-through via (R2) has a radius of 0.29-mm and the thickness is 0.3-mm. This section is hollow to insulate the
feed-lead from the header. The inside feed-lead is designed as a 90-degree bent shape to shorten the length of bonding wires
between the feed-lead and the laser diode chip. Because we intend to utilize this TO-Can header under load impedances of 5 to 50-Ω, 
above dimension is an optimum result. However, by adjusting the R1, R2, and the distance between the center of feed-lead and the
stem, the impedance can match with specific load impedance further.

5. ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON OF THE NEW TO-CAN HEADER AND CONVENTIONAL
TO-56 HEADER
The electrical characteristics of the new TO-Can header and a convention TO-56 header with the electrical field diagrams and
S-parameters by using HFSS is simulated and analyzed. The simulated configurations and the electrical field diagrams of the new
TO-Can header and the TO-56 header are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. A lumped port is inserted at the center of the
header to represent the load. The lumped port directly links to the stem of the electrical ground. We can simulate the situations of
different load by varying the impedance of lumped port. A perfect conductor plane is placed between the inside feed-lead and the
lumped port to conduct the electrical signal. In a real case, bonding wires are used to connect the inside feed-lead and the load.
Bonding wires induce parasitic inductance and degrade the electrical characteristics. However, the appearance of bonding wires will
blur the inherent performance of the header. So the bonding wires are replaced by a perfect conductor. The operating frequency and
the load are set at 15-GHz and 50-Ωin the simulation of Fig. 6. The discretized vectors of the electrical field distribution are both
TEM mode in the coaxial feed-lead. The intensity of electrical field of the TO-56 header is apparently small and weak than the new
TO-Can header. Because the TO-56 header has a bigger drop of impedance between the coaxial feed-lead and the inside feed-lead,
the power of microwave propagation is sharply reduced. However, the impedance discontinuity of the new TO-Can header has
minimized between the coaxial feed-lead and the inside feed-lead. The microwave power can be propagated completely in the
two-section coaxial feed-lead. Therefore, the intensity of electrical field of the new TO-Can header is apparently stronger than the
TO-56 header in the coaxial feed-lead. The impedance matching of coaxial feed-lead of the new TO-Can header has a significant
improvement for electrical field propagation.

6. CONCLUSION
In summary, a new TO-Can header for the low-cost coaxial laser package has been proposed and demonstrated by a 3D full-wave
electromagnetic simulation. The applicability of the simulation tool has been verified with an experimental result. The reflection
loss, insertion loss, and phase of this TO-Can header show significant improvements by comparing with the conventional TO-56
header. The simulated reflection loss is beneath –10-dB under 15-GHz at a 50- load impedance, the 3-dB modulated bandwidth
achieves 23-GHz and 37-GHz for a 5- and 50- load impedance, respectively, and the phase was linear in the interesting
operation range. This superior TO-Can header provides a low-cost solution for coaxial laser package and can be applied in the
emerging 100-Gigabits Ethernet (100GbE) network and the next generation Fiber Channel (20GFC) of storage area network.
