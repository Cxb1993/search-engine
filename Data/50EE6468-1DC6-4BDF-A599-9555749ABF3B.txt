摘要 
電子商務的發展已達到一個瓶頸，因為它不能提供顧客更直觀的購物資訊，提高顧客的購
物決策，尤其是對於像傢俱、 服裝、 鞋類和首飾等，須試用的產品。在此專案中，我們
研究使用擴增實境 (AR) 技術，提高電子商務的實用性，並提供線上購物者更直接的購物
資訊。AR 為遠端使用者提供了較佳的臨場感。這份報告描述使用 AR 電子商務在家具設計
中的案例研究。研究結果顯示，結合虛擬產品模型與物質環境資訊，AR 電子商務系統可以
提供線上客戶更多的資訊和更直接的購物經驗。線上購物者在線上購物的同時，可以"測試
使用"產品，並獲取有關產品的詳細資訊。因此，客戶可以更正確地進行購物決策，和更佳
的機會購買"正確"的產品。  
1. AR e-commerce Process 
Making 3D models of existing objects is very time consuming. The first step of the AR 
e-commerce process is to recover the 3D model of an object.  
1.1 3D model recovery 
To make the stereo matching process easier and more accurate, color tags were attached to the 
key positions of an object. These tags help to decrease the ambiguity of key features in different 
viewpoints, which might affect the recovered result. These tagged points in the two images were 
then picked and matched to calculate and reconstruct the 3D model.  
The recovered 3D model was save as a standard VRML file which could be easily imported to 
almost any CAD software for editing and rendering. Figure 1 show the developed 3D model 
recovery interface.

After normalization, the normalized 3D object can be added to the database in the server together 
with other information. The AR e-commerce web page was built as shown in Figure 2. With the 
web page and the database server running, online shoppers are able to use it and “visually” bring 
this sofa into their own home to see whether it is a good fit, using a laptop, markers and a web 
camera. Figure 3 shows that a shopper was “trying” the sofa in a sitting room. 
AR e-commerce technology provides the capability to examine how products fit in the space. 
Users can naturally see what happens before actually buying online products so that they can 
instantly check whether or not the products are fit in their environments or not.

87.5% of participants mentioned in their feedback that the AR e-commerce system needs more 
high-end hardware equipment, and that it is inconvenient to use laptop. Some participants 
suggested using a small device (like a cell phone) to replace the laptop. However, 12.5% of 
participants believed that the AR e-commerce system was convenient to use. Users’ comments 
included: “It is friendly and looks real.” “It is easy to manipulate. It is a more natural interactive 
method than mouse interaction”. From the feedback, most users indicated that they were not 
familiar with the AR interface; they would also prefer to use smaller handheld hardware devices, 
rather than a laptop computer.  
3. Conclusions 
This project designed and developed an AR e-commerce prototype, which helps online shoppers 
“visually” bring products into their own environments to make online shopping more efficient 
and more reliable. Several key issues in the AR e-commerce tool includes creating realistic 3D 
product models, normalization, real time rendering, and model merging. The effectiveness of the 
tool was demonstrated using practical case studies. The studies demonstrate an innovative and 
powerful approach to enhance e-commerce and online shopping, which may also benefit other 
related areas.
