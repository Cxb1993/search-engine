Ordering transformation of FePt thin films by initial 
stress/strain control 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
In recent years, L10 FePt was commonly accepted as a highly potential material for 
different applications such as permanent magnets for dentistry or micromechanics, nanoparticles 
for biological tracer or label, and thin films for data storage technology. Generally, the 
as-prepared FePt particles or films possess soft magnetic disorder phase. To obtain L10 order 
structure with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy (Ku), a proper thermal process is required to 
trigger order-disorder transformation. The process and mechanism of ordering reaction have been 
extensively investigated. For thin films, many factors or treatments were found to influent 
ordering significantly including binary composition [1], [2], the addition of dopants [3]-[6], 
underlayer/toplayer induction [7]-[9], ion irradiation [10]-[12], and multilayer structures 
[13]-[15], etc. Significant effect of pressure on order-disorder reactions in bulk materials was 
firstly reported by Hazen et al. [16]. The external stress can either assist or hinder the phase 
transformation of an order alloy. In FePt thin films, in-situ observation of internal strain evolution 
was firstly reported by Wierman et al. [17], the results indicate that the ordering of FePt 
neutralize the initial compressive strain. A further study shows that the induction of dynamic 
tensile stress enhances ordering reaction [18]. The role of internal stress/strain on ordering of 
FePt is crucial but not comprehensive. Our previous study indicates that the initial stress/strain 
plays crucial role in ordering of post annealed FePt films [19]. The onset temperature of ordering 
can be reduced by 100 ˚C when the internal stress of the room temperature (RT) deposited film is 
adjusted from about -1 GPa compressive to 0.2 GPa tensile. In this study, further control of the 
internal stress of the RT deposited FePt films and the ordering behaviors of them are reported. By 
insertion of SiO2 underlayer with different thickness, tensile stress with value up to 1.1 GPa can 
be successfully induced. Interestingly, the very high tensile stress was found to suppress 
order-disorder transformation. This result, different from that caused by compressive stress, is 
believed due to the suppression of densification process prior to the on set of ordering. Detailed 
mechanism is discussed. 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
 
FePt single-layer thin films were deposited by radio frequency (RF) sputtering at room 
temperature (RT) with a background vacuum better than 3×10-7 torr on Corning 1737 glass 
3 
 
obtained from the fitting can be used to determine the internal stress (σ) by ε/Sin2ψ = σ[(1 + ν)/E], 
where ν is Poisson’s ratio and E is Young’s modulus. They are taking as 0.33 and 180 GPa [21], 
respectively, for calculation. 
The results of σ for the films with various tUL and lw are summarized in Fig. 3. It is clear 
that tUL and lw significantly alters σ in different ways. In the single layer samples (tUL = 0), σ 
evolves from -0.95 GPa (compressive) into 0.2 GPa (tensile) with decreasing lw from 9 to 6 cm. 
The effect of lw on σ also exists in those underlayered samples as indicated by the shifted stress 
curves. The insertion of SiO2 underlayer tends to induce strong tensile stress. The stress increases 
abruptly when reaching a critical value of tUL and then changes slowly. Drastic jumps in σ occur 
at tUL = 5 for the films with lw = 5, at tUL = 10 for lw = 7 and 8, and at tUL = 20 for lw = 9. It further 
enhances the tensile stress of the of the films with lw = 5 and 6 to more than 1 GPa, neutralize the 
negative σ in the films with lw = 8, and decreases the compressive stress of the samples deposited 
at 9 cm. The results confirm the wide range tenability of internal stress from -0.95 GPa to 1.1 
GPa of RT-deposited FePt films by insertion of SiO2 underlayer and controlling deposition 
distance.  
Selected samples with similar chemical composition but different σ are submitted to RTA to 
study the effect of initial stress on order transformation. Ordering initiates at Ta = 350-400˚C and 
completes at Ta ≥ 650˚C. Figures 4(a)-(d) show diffraction patterns for the samples with σ = -0.95, 
-0.04, 0.20, and 0.67 GPa annealed at 350˚C for 15 min, respectively. The pattern for the film 
with σ = 0.20 shows weak (001) and (110) superlattice peaks as well as the split of (200) peak, 
revealing the onset of ordering; while other profiles exhibit only fundamental diffractions. The 
result suggests an optimized value of σ for ordering rather than the maximized tensile stress as 
predicted previously. 
In-plane hysteresis loops for the films with different σ annealed at 350˚C for 15 min are 
shown in Fig. 5(a)-5(d). Films with σ = -0.95 GPa and 0.67 GPa exhibit low coercivity (Hc) of 
about 0.2 kOe and high saturation magnetization of about 980 emu/cm3, which are typical 
features for disorder phase. A slight increase in Hc (0.8 kOe) appears in the film with σ = -0.04, 
suggesting the nucleation of L10 phase. Enhanced Hc of 2.2 kOe and reduced magnetization at 1.2 
tesla of 740 emu/cm3 are obtained in the sample with σ = 0.20. The magnetic hardening is 
consistent with the formation of L10 phase identified by XRD. The increase of Ku by ordering 
results in larger Hc and disables the film from saturation by magnetic field of 1.2 tesla. 
Dependence of coercivity on σ for the FePt films annealed at 350˚C for 15 min is displayed 
in Fig. 6. Samples with large negative σ exhibit small Hc of about 0.2 kOe. With the decrease of 
compressive stress to -0.04 GPa, Hc slightly increases to 0.83 kOe. After reaching a peak value of 
2.2 kOe at σ = 0.20, Hc decreases with further increase of tensile stress to again 0.2 kOe. The 
variation of Hc reflects the structural change of FePt since the magnetic hardening originates 
from the enhanced Ku by atomic ordering. The presented results show that both compressive 
internal stress (σ < -0.04 GPa) and large tensile stress (σ > 0.52 GPa) suppress the formation of 
L10 FePt phase. The role that compressive stress plays has been explained in details previously by 
the effect of volume change induced by order transformation [19]. We should now discuss the 
reason for the suppression of ordering by large tensile stress. For a RT-deposited FePt film treated

sputtering with background vacuum better than 2 × 10-7 Torr. The films were deposited on 
Corning 1737 glass substrates. Two series of samples were prepared in different annealing 
condition; (1) in-situ annealing, e.g., films were deposited on pre-heated substrates at certain 
temperature (Ts) and held for 10 minutes, (2) post-annealing, e.g., films were deposited at room 
temperature (RT) and then annealed at desirable temperature (Ta) for 10 minutes in the vacuum 
chamber. The annealing temperature ranged from 200 to 700 °C. Crystallographic structure was 
identified by in-house diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.541 Å) radiation. Ordering parameter (S) 
was obtained from the integral intensities of fundamental and superlattice peaks, proposed by 
Warren. [9] The S values were corrected by Lorentz factor, thin film absorption factor, 
multiplicity factor, anomalous scattering factor, as well as Debye-Waller factor and 
off-stoichiometry factor. [9] Coherent domain size (Dsw) was estimated by Stokes and Wilson 
method, which is more suitable for thin film materials containing internal stress [10]. Sin2ψ 
method [11] (ψ is the angle between diffraction vector and sample normal) was employed to 
measure residual strain (εr) using synchrotron radiation with beam energy of 8 keV (λ = 1.5500 
Å), supported by 17B1 station, Taiwan Light Source (TLS). In-plane residual strain was obtained 
from dependence of (111) planer spacing on ψ angles. The parameters for strain measurement 
used in this work have been depicted in our published papers [7,8].  Chemical composition of 
the FePt films was confirmed to be 52:48 using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) technique. The 
surface morphology of the samples was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscope 
(FE-SEM).  
Since the residual strain was ex-situ measured, effect of thermal strain induced by different 
coefficient of the thermal expansion (CTEs) between FePt film and glass substrate should be 
considered. The methods and assumptions for the correction have been described extensively 
elsewhere [8]. 
 
III. RESULTS 
 
The dependence of εr on annealing temperature for the FePt films with different annealing 
process is shown in Fig. 1. For post-annealed samples, εr of the films change from –0.37 % 
(compressive) to a peak value of 0.42 % (tensile) as the post-annealed temperature (Ta) increases 
to 275 °C. With increasing Ta up to 300 °C, εr drops dramatically to 0.04 %. For the films with Ta 
> 400 °C, the tensile strain raises again to 0.34 % (Ta = 700 °C). In terms of in-situ annealed 
samples, the εr curve displays a different behavior, especially at low temperature region. It 
rapidly increases from –0.37 % to around –0.07 % for samples with in-situ annealing temperature 
(Ts) < 300 °C. When increasing Ts up to 350 °C, εr almost vanishes, thereafter, gradually inclines 
in tensile direction. For the post-annealed samples, the residual strain accumulate in tensile 
direction in high temperature region (≥ 500 °C). In the contrary, the residual strain of in-situ 
annealed samples saturate at Ts ≥ 500 °C. In addition, εr for in-situ annealed samples shows 
greater error in low temperature region (200 – 300 °C) than that of post-annealed samples. This 
11 
 
RT-deposited films would result in planer tensile strain [13]. On the contrary, for in-situ annealed 
samples the dynamic relaxation of strain may process through free surface diffusion, since the 
atomic mobility of adatoms deposited onto substrates in in-situ annealed samples are much 
higher than that in post-annealed samples. Note that, Dsw in in-situ annealed samples are higher 
than that of post-annealed films in low temperature regions, which also resulted from difference 
of atomic mobility of the films. We believe that the mechanisms for residual strain relief before 
sign-change strain for post- and in-situ annealed films are extrinsically distinct (tensile stress 
accumulation or dynamic relaxation). 
Annealing methods significantly affect the εr dependent ordering at a heating temperature 275 
°C; the sudden drop in εr values occurs in the post-annealed samples. The onset of nucleation of 
ordered phase can be responsible for the sudden drop of εr [8], consistent with the results of local 
decrease of Dsw values (the inset of figure 3) in the wake of L10 nucleation site with very small 
size. On the contrary, a plateau of εr appears in in-situ annealed samples (Ta ~ 275 °C), which 
may also result from dynamic strain relief during film deposition, while there is no observable 
local decrease of Dsw. More importantly, we suggested that the different consequences of εr prior 
to L10 ordering would lead to disparate ordering mechanisms. In our previous works, we reported 
that the nucleation temperature of L10 FePt can be reduced if the disordered films contain a 
tensile stress [8]. The accumulation of tensile strain energies in vicinities of disordered grains can 
be considered as a heterogeneous nucleation sites with extra driving force for L10 nucleation, 
analogous to the concepts claimed by Takahashi and Hono [14]. For in-situ annealed samples, 
nevertheless, homogenous nucleation formed by local atomic rearrangement during film 
deposition can be expected according to our previous works [7], because there is no obvious 
residual stress containing in the disordered grains and the nucleation temperature is expected to 
be small. As annealing temperature increases to above Tord, the tensile strains are induced by 
elimination of volumetric defects such as grain boundaries, though the dynamic stress relief 
during annealing is expected in both series. The dynamic relaxation and microstructural 
evaluation can also explain the difference of εr in high temperature range (≥ 400 °C) due to the 
difference of atomic mobility of adatoms aforementioned, since the adatoms with high mobility 
tend to grow in three dimensions to form island in order to reduce film/substrate interfacial 
energy. Note that, for in-situ annealed samples the Dsw values are larger than that of the samples 
post-annealed at high temperature region, due to the difference of atomic mobility. 
The various nucleation mechanisms may further result in afterward microstructure evolutions 
of the films. When nucleation is spatially random (homogeneous), grain growth is stagnated by 
impingement of growing cells with a constant velocity and by limitations of substrate and free 
surface interface. A microstructure with narrow size distribution is expected. In the case of 
non-spatially random (heterogeneous), abnormal grain growth with larger size, preferred 
nucleation sites consume parent matrix with rapid velocity, is thought as a preferred mechanism 
for phase transformation [13]. Noting that, the abnormal grain growth was also observed in our 
works, indicated by the arrows in Fig. 4 (b).

were subjected to RTA furnace at temperature of 800 °C with heating rate of 20 °C/s. The 
holding time (t) of annealing process varies from 0 to 3600 s. Note that t = 0 indicates that RTA 
furnace was power off when sample temperature reaches the objective temperature (800 °C in 
this study). In-plane residual stress/strain was obtained by sin2ψ method using synchrotron 
radiation with beam energy of 8 keV (λ = 1.5500 Å), supported by 17B1 station, Taiwan Light 
Source (TLS), which have been described extensively elsewhere [10,13]. Crystallographic 
structure of the samples was probed using x-ray diffractometry (XRD) with Bragg-Brentano 
geometry using in-house Cu Kα source (18 kW). Magnetic properties of the samples were 
measured by vibrating sample magnetometer with maximum applied field of 1.2 Tesla at RT. 
Surface morphology of the samples was observed by field-emission scanning electron 
microscopy (FE-SEM). 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-deposited and annealed films at 800 °C for 
various holding times. A disordered structure with (111) fiber texture was observed in 
as-deposited samples. For the annealed FePt films, the appearance of superlattice (001) peak 
indicates the occurrence of L10 ordering. Ordering parameter (Sord) obtained form the integrated 
intensity of superlattice and fundamental peaks is determined using Warren’s method [14]. The 
Sord were higher than 0.87 for the annealed FePt films. Additionally, the splitting of the 
fundamental (200) reflection into superlattice (200) and (002) peak, resulting from transition of 
lattice symmetry (cubic to tetragonal), was explicitly observed for the annealed samples, 
indicative of near-fully ordered structures. 
To investigate degree of preferred orientation, a semi-quantitative method, Lotgering 
orientation factor (LOF) was used [15]. For specific texture in thin film, e.g., (00l), LOF = (p − 
p0)/(1 − p0), where p = ∑(00l)film/∑(hkl)film and p0 = ∑(00l)powder/∑(hkl)powder. LOF has values 
ranging form a certain negative value to 1; negative value indicates a preferred orientation rather 
than (00l), e.g., (111) texture, 0 refers to a random orientation, and 1 represents perfect (001) 
orientation. Dependence of LOF of (00l) orientation on holding time is shown in Fig. 2(a). It 
reveals that LOF was −0.39 for the as-deposited film, indicating a fully (111) preferred 
orientation. The LOF value dramatically increases from −0.12 to 0.99 as t was increased from 0 
to 900 s. With further increasing of t from 900 to 3600, the LOF gradually declined to 0.81. 
The d-spacing examined from (111) reflection as a function of sin2ψ for the RT-deposited 
and annealed FePt films was performed. By further fitting linearity, the R2 factor (goodness-of-fit) 
of fitting ranges from 0.93 to 0.99, denoting biaxial residual stress along the in-plane direction of 
film plane. Dependence of residual stress (σ) on annealing holding time is demonstrated in Fig. 
2(b). The Error bar stands for the error of slope by linear fitting, smaller than the symbol size in 
this study. For the as-deposited sample, σ was compressive with magnitude of 0.66 GPa. A 
significant change of σ from −0.66 to 0.86 GPa (tensile stress) was found, when sample was 
annealed at 800 °C (t = 0 s). As increasing of t, σ inclined and reached a plateau value of ~1.27 
19 
 
magnetically single phase is expected for the annealed films. This enables us to define a 
semi-quantitative parameter, differential squareness Sdif = S⊥  − S// , to probe the degree of 
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Physically, Sdif has a value ranging from −1 to 1, where −1 
indicates perfect longitudinal magnetic anisotropy; 1 refers to complete perpendicular magnetic 
anisotropy. Dependence of Sdif on holding time is demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 5, displaying a 
considerable consistency with the residual stress, LOFs and crystalline size in the Fig. 2. 
Enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, verified by Sdif of 0.5, was obtained for the film 
annealed for 900 s, which also indicate that the variation of Sdif is more sensitive to distribution of 
c-axis orientation than that of LOF (0.99 for this sample). 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
 
We have characterized the residual stress, crystallographic structure, and magnetic orientation 
of the films annealed at 800 °C for various times. The intrinsic tensile stress is found to play a 
crucial factor in the development of (001) texture for the fully ordered FePt films. With 
increasing of holding time, the densification induces the tensile stress for samples with 
continuous structure, which leads to a development of (001) orientation. Relaxation of the tensile 
stress corresponds to the change of surface morphology, which further leads to a reduction of 
LOFs. The strain-induced grain growth was also suggested for one of key factors for 
development of (001) texture. Nearly perfect (001) textured films was obtained in the film 
annealed for 900 s evidenced by a LOF of 0.99, which results in a high perpendicular magnetic 
anisotropy of the film, confirmed by a Sdif of 0.5. The results of this study provide direction 
evidence for effect of intrinsic stress on (001) texture in near-fully ordered FePt films, which may 
contribute useful knowledge for future engineering application.
