2or movement the desired joints10, 15, 16.
Nowadays, most researches for upper-limb FES system focus on hand system, for example,
FreeHand system (USA) 17-19 and Hand Master (Israel) 16, 20, 21. Few studies focus on the restoration
of shoulder, elbow and wrist movement22-27, but they are still needed to be further improved for
better control of these joints.
To achieve this objective, many tasks need to be performed. Fortunately, we have well
performed the projects for restoring hand functions of patients with upper limb paralysis. Three
main hand functions (cup grasp, key pinch and 3-jaw apprehension) can be performed by using the
self-developed FES system in previous studies. Due to weakness of the proximal part of upper
limbs, the FES system for hand motion alone is inadequate to perform activity of daily living. We
plan to further extend its application to restore wrist, elbow and shoulder functions as well. We also
plan to further develop an orthosis for supporting and guiding paralyzed upper limb motion and for
easy doffing and donning, so that the orthotic hybrid FES system will be practically useful. It is
expected to be a three-year project.
Based on the movement model of the shoulder and elbow established in the first year, and
based on the self-developed orthosis for guiding the proximal upper limb motion to perform upper
limb ADL functions in the second year. In the 3rd year project, the goal is to perform the system
integration and setting the measurement and evaluation protocols to refine the orthotic hybrid
system
???????????
In the previous years (1st and 2nd), we had performed the following tasks
Year 1: Functional Analysis & Development of Orthosis Model :
(1) Functional analysis of the proximal upper limb in activities of daily living
(2) Computer model for elbow and shoulder motion
(3) Development of orthosis model for adapting to the FES system
Year 2: Control Algorithms & Design of an Orthotic Hybrid FES System
(1) Development of the orthotic hybrid FES system for paralyzed upper limbs
(2) Control algorithms for functional motion trajectories
(3) To analyze the upper-limb functions while using the prototype system to perform
ADL tasks and to upgrade the system
Based on the previous works, we implemented the hybrid FES system with the self-developed
4working properly before patient test.
(b) Application on patients with upper-limb paralysis:
Three stroke patients were recruited, their paralyzed upper limbs could performed hand grasp
at different arm setting position with the assistance of the hybrid FES system.
(c) Control parameter tuning & system simplification:
The clinical test was performed for controller tuning and for system simplification. From a
practical point of view, the self-developed hybrid FES system reduced the problem of
don-doff and interference without compromising the efficacy. Through preliminary clinical
trial, we simplified the hybrid FES system and made it possible for upper-limb paralyzed
patients’laboratory use.
???????
Based on the professional knowledge in mechanism, biomechanics of upper limbs, the control
algorism and design of the upper-limb orthosis for the hybrid FES system is performed.
Our design philosophy is that the user should have the freedom to change his hand posture at
any instant as he wishes with the upper-limb orthosis. The hybrid FES system should have a
transparent behavior, so that the user can manipulate it easily. (Like using a computer mouse, the
cursor on the computer screen will move with the motion of the mouse accordingly, although its
underlying electronic and mechanical devices and background program may be very complex.)
As a result, we designed a “command controler” which lets the user to generate task goal and 
change task trajectory at any time. Therefore, the main function of the controller is to regulate
stimulation parameters to accomplish the desired posture and maintain the object in hand when it is
used for doing ADL.
The system setup and development require professional knowledge in mechanics, electrical
engineering, and computer programming. The process is very laborious and time-consuming. The
controller for upper-limb functions is not easy to design. It is a so-called MIMO
(Multi-Input-Multi-Output) system, i.e. it involves slip and force input signals, and the stimulation
output to different channels. In addition, the paralyzed muscle has nonlinear response to electrical
stimulation. The paralyzed muscles fatigue quickly makes control algorism even more difficult to
work smoothly.
Due to the complex anatomical and functional structure of upper extremities, the detailed
kinematic information of motions is difficult to be acquired or mimicked precisely. Besides, the
orthtic hybrid FES system is also complicated. In the 3rd year, system integration was performed.
We conducted a preliminary test to perform some specific functions by using the self-developed
prototype orthotic hybrid FES system in normal subjects and patients with stroke. We simplified the
hybrid FES system and made it come true for upper-limb paralyzed patients’laboratory use.
