Those approaches commonly have a drawback, which codeword-checking (or syndrome 
computation) is absent during their decoding processes. In other words, regardless of whether the 
received sequence is correct or not, the decoding algorithm proceeds to decode it. This work 
overcomes this drawback by presenting a modified EKE algorithm with codeword checking. The 
syndrome computations are performed prior to such a proposed decoding algorithm. A matrix 
operation is also proposed to obtain the transmission information from the received codeword. 
For syndrome-based decoding, if the syndrome vector is all-zero, then the decoding process 
terminated, and the received sequence is output as a decoded codeword. In addition, the EKE 
algorithm [13] is proposed only for the decoding rate 3/1≤R . In overcoming such a limitation, 
based on the ordering of y-power’s in the polynomial ),( yxQ , the work proposes a way suitably 
to decode a GRS with any code rate.  
The rest of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 presents binary image codes of GRS 
codes. Section 3 introduces the EKE algorithm. Section 4 presents the modified EKE algorithm 
based on syndrome computations and matrix operations to obtain the transmission information 
from the received codeword. Additionally, some examples are given to illustrate the benefit of 
the modified EKE algorithm. Section 5 displays the complexity analysis of these two EKE 
algorithms. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 6.

in an [n, k] GRS code over GF(2m) is generated as 
3. Extended Key Equation Algorithm 
The term l  is the upper bound of the number of consistent codewords, which are at 
Hamming distance τ≤  from any received word. For an (n, k) GRS code, Sudan’s algorithm 
corrects any error pattern of up to τ  errors for

Let F be a field and ][xFk  represent the set of all polynomials of degree < k in the variable

 Theorem 3: Let G be a generator matrix of an (n, k) GRS code. The codeword checking w  
is checked to be all-zero as rv =ˆ  is a received codeword, and then the transmission 
message is given by  
Mmm ⋅= '                                         (16) 
where 'm  is the last k-tuple of vˆ  and M is a k × k matrix such that GMG ⋅='  is a 
systematical matrix. 
In [13], once an (n, k) GRS code with code rate 3/1≤R  is selected, then the values of 
τ , b, and l are determined in (6)-(8). Since the EKE algorithm is only used in decoding such 
a low code rate GRS code, it is therefore not employed in decoding the other high code rate 
GRS codes. In the following, a modified EKE algorithm is proposed to overcome such a 
code rate limitation. We denote |),(| yxQ  as the number of monomials in a bivariate 
polynomial ),( yxQ .

5. Terminate decoding 
The following two examples illustrate the modified EKE decoding algorithm. Firstly, this 
proposed algorithm decodes GRS (7, 3) code, as error-free and error-existing conditions are 
encountered. The other case is to decode GRS (15, 3) code with errors more than 2/)( kn − , 
which 7 errors are corrected in proposed decoding.

5. Complexity Analysis 
in which GRS codes of length 255 and code rate 3/1≤R  are employed and the smallest 
value of l, which is l = 2 , is selected. For cases of 1.0≤R  (equally, the message length 
25≤k ), the sizes of S-matrices in (11) are less than those in (20). However, for the other 
cases, the complexity of (10) might be larger than that of (20), based on that the sizes of 
S-matrices in (10) are larger than those in (20).

The computations of syndrome elements do not increase the complexity of the original EKE 
algorithm, because it is an item in such a proposed decoding. The proposed EKE algorithm is 
beneficial when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Additionally, this work provides a way to 
generalize the EKE algorithm, which decodes a GRS code with any code rate. The proposed 
EKE algorithm requires less complexity than the original EKE algorithm does while GRS 
codes of code length 255 and code rate 3.01.0 ≤≤ R  are used.
