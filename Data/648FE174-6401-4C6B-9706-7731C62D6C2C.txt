Abstract: This study constructs interference-based model of the 
apertureless scanning near-field optical microscopy (A-SNOM) heterodyne 
detection signal which takes account of both the tip enhancement 
phenomena and the tip reflective background electric field. The analytical 
model not only provides a meaningful explanation of the image artifacts and 
errors, but also suggests methods for reducing these effects. It is shown that 
the detection signal obtained in the heterodyne A-SNOM method has a 
significantly higher signal-to-background (S/B) ratio than in the homodyne 
method. It is also shown that the S/B ratio increases as the wavelength of 
the illuminating light source is increased or the incident angle is reduced. 
Finally, an inspection reveals two fundamental phenomena which may 
potentially be exploited to obtain further significant improvements, namely 
(1) the modulation depth parameter has certain specific values greater than 
1; and (2) the AFM tip apparatus using a ramp function.

detection enables a magnification of the near field signal [7, 16], and is therefore an ideal 
solution for measuring the near-field complex dielectric constant. However, the literature 
contains very little information regarding the respective effects of the principal A-SNOM 
parameters (i.e. the wavelength and incident angle of the illumination light and the amplitude 
of the AFM tip vibration) on the contrast and intensity of the heterodyne detection signal [7-
9].  
 Accordingly, the current study develops a comprehensive interference-based model with 
which to analyze the amplitude and phase of the heterodyne detection signal at different 
harmonics of the tip vibration frequency. In constructing this model, the present study 
expands the model presented in [15] to take account not only of the electric field scattered 
directly from the AFM tip, but also the tip scattering field reflected from the sample. The 
latter field is highly important in A-SNOM detection since it is has a very high intensity and a 
double value of the phase modulation depth. The current analysis deliberately considers the 
reflective-type A-SNOM technique [7-9] since this technique is invariably the method of 
choice when measuring the surface properties of materials at the nanoscale. Compared to the 
models presented in [7-8, 13-14], the model developed in this study provides clearer and more 
concise explanations for the various phenomena observed in the A-SNOM detection 
technique. Moreover the interference-based formulation developed for the S/B ratio in the 
current study has no points of discontinuity, and therefore represents a more suitable means of 
analyzing the detection signal than the signal contrast formula presented by the current group 
in [15]. The dependency of the S/B ratio on the wavelength and incident angle of the 
illuminating light source is systematically examined and discussed. Finally, various means of 
improving the S/B ratio are introduced and discussed. 
 
2.     Electric fields in heterodyne A-SNOM 
Figure 1 presents a schematic illustration of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer-type A-SNOM. 
As shown, a radian frequency shift Δω is added to the reference beam by a generic frequency 
shifting device such as an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). Therefore, the reference beam can 
be expressed analytically as

where ER is the amplitude of the reference beam and ω and ΦR are the radian frequency and 
initial phase of the incident light, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the measurement 
beam,
  
iE , is focused on a vibrating AFM tip by an objective lens. Figure 2 presents an 
enlarged view of the near-field region. It can be seen that the incident electric field,
  
iE , strikes 
the sample with an angle θ and produces four discrete electromagnetic waves, namely (1) an 
interaction signal, T SE −
  
, between the AFM tip and the sample; (2) an electric field, TipE   , 
scattered directly from the AFM tip; (3) an electric field, Tip _ ReflectiveE   , scattered from the AFM 
tip and then reflected from the sample surface; and (4) an electric field,    SampleE , scattered 
directly from the sample. As shown, an assumption is made in the current analysis that all the 
incident light and detected light passes through the objective lens. 
The first field of interest in A-SNOM detection is that produced by the interaction 
between the AFM tip and the sample. According to the general model of quasi-electrostatic 
theory [7-9], the interaction (or tip enhancement) electric field can be formulated as

where Jn(ψ3) and Jn(2ψ3) are n-th order Bessel functions of the first kind at the phase 
modulation depths ψ3 and 2ψ3, respectively. In Eq.(11), it can be seen that the higher order 
background electric field signals in EREP and EREP_R decay more rapidly as the modulation 
depth, ψ3 , approaches zero [15].  
Since the amplitude of the interaction electric field between the tip and the sample is 
nonlinear, an assumption is made that ET-S can be expressed as the sum of the individual 
components oscillating at different harmonics of the AFM probe modulation radian frequency

a radius of 20 nm and a dielectric value of -10 + 2 i [7-8, 19]. The normalized simulation 
results presented in Fig. 3 show that the amplitude of the tip enhancement electric field decays 
steeply at tip-to-sample separation distances of less than 40 nm, but then converges to a value 
of approximately 0.2 as the separation distance increases. This tendency reflects the fact that 
the electric dipole enhancement effect is very high in the near-field region, but has a low, 
constant value at greater tip-to-sample distances [7-9].

component of near-field 
interaction electric field with tip-to-sample distance Z0 (nm). 
 
In order to achieve a level playing field when comparing the present analytical results with 
the experimental results presented in [7-8], the parameters in the (Δω+1ω0)-order components 
of Eq. (14) must be assigned reasonable values. Thus, the phase difference (ΦR-ΦTS) is set to 
π/3. Note that the phase ΦTS of the near-field electric field is assumed to be independent of the 
tip-to-sample distance Z0 because it is related only to the effective polarizability parameter αeff 
[7]. Furthermore, the relative amplitudes EP and EP_R, are assigned values of 0.05 and 0.5, 
respectively. In addition, the relative amplitude of the reference electric field, ER, is specified 
as 1000 referring to [7-8]. The phase differences between the two fields can be written as ψ1 = 
(ΦR－ΦP) +2Ksin(θ)Z0 and ψ2 = (ΦR－ΦP) +4Ksin(θ)Z0, respectively, where K is the wave 
number and the initial phase (ΦR－ΦP) is assumed to be -π. Finally, the incident angle of the 
illuminating light, θ, is specified as π/6 and the amplitude of the tip vibration is assigned a 
value of A=20 nm [7-8]. As a result, the phase modulation depth has a value of ψ3 = 2Ksin(θ)A 
= 0.199. The variations of the amplitude and phase of the (Δω+1ω0)-order frequency 
component of the interaction electric field signal can then be obtained as a function of the tip-
to-sample distance, Z0 , directly from Eq. (14), as illustrated in Fig. 4.

5. Analysis of A-SNOM image artifacts and errors using analytical model 
 
From Section 3, it is clear that the A-SNOM detection signal (either homodyne or heterodyne) 
is highly complex. As a result, the quality of the A-SNOM image obtained from the AFM tip 
scanning operation is subject to many influencing factors. Therefore, to improve the A-SNOM 
image quality, it is essential to identify the various sources of artifacts and errors, and to take 
appropriate remedial actions to suppress their effects [13-14]. 
5.1 Image artifacts 
Image artifacts are induced by variations in the topography of the scanned sample surface and 
are essentially fake near-field signals. As shown in Fig 2, the sample topography is not flat, 
and thus the height of the tip must be dynamically adjusted in accordance with the atomic 
force between the tip and the sample in order to maintain a constant tip-to-sample distance Z0 
during the tip scanning process. The initial phase ΦP of the tip scattering electric field Pr obeE
 
 
should therefore be modified to the form ΦP + 2Ksin(θ)ΔZ, where ΔZ
 
is the variation of the 
sample surface from its initial position. Consequently, the phase differences 1ψ  and 2ψ  
should be reformulated as follows: 
sin( ) sin( )
sin( ) sin( )

2 R P 0
2K Z 2K Z
4K Z 2K Z
ψ φ φ θ θ ∆
ψ φ φ θ θ ∆
= − − −
= − − −
 (15) 
From Eq. (15), it can be seen that the image artifacts induced by the sample topography 
have the extra form 2Ksin(θ)ΔZ. The term, 2Ksin(θ)ΔZ in Eq. (15) is consistent with that in 
Eq. (4) presented in [13]. Significantly, however, compared to [13], the derivation of the 
image artifact formulation presented in this study does not require the establishment of a 
complex dipole-dipole theoretical model and, moreover, takes explicit account of the near-
field interaction effect. In other words, the model developed in this study provides both a 
simpler and a more comprehensive explanation of the A-SNOM artifact phenomenon than 
that proposed in [13].  
 From the derivations and discussions above, it is clear that the problem of image artifacts 
in heterodyne A-SNOM detection can be easily resolved by performing a sample stage 
scanning operation rather than a tip scanning operation. In this way, the initial phase ΦP of the 
tip scattering electric field, Pr obeE
 
, remains constant throughout the  sample stage  scanning 
operation. Furthermore, even though the initial phase of the sample scattering field is 
modified to ΦS + 2Ksin(θ)ΔZ, the heterodyne detection signal intensities IΔω+nω0,(n≧ 1) in 
Eq.(14) are not affected, and thus the image artifacts induced by the sample topography 
effectively disappear by operating a sample stage scanning. It should be noticed that the stage 
scanning does not affect the optical paths of the probe direct scattering field ProbeE
  
and the 
probe scattered field Pr obe _ ReflectiveE
  
 reflected from the sample. It is because that the tip-to-
sample distance keeps constant with AFM feedback control. 
5.2 Image errors 
When an A-SNOM tip scans a sample with discontinuous boundaries, the amplitude of the tip 
vibration, A, is affected by changes in the discontinuous geometry and/or material as a result 
of the corresponding variations in the attractive Van der Waals forces between the tip and the 
sample surface. Thus, even though an AFM feedback control scheme is employed to trace the 
tip amplitude vibration variation ΔA, the speed of the scanning process is usually such that the 
vibration of the tip amplitude can not be maintained as a perfect constant, and thus the A-
SNOM detection signal contains fake signals induced by variations in the tip vibration 
amplitude [14]. Furthermore, the amplitude of the tip vibration is related to the modulation 
depth, ψ3, and the Fourier expansion coefficients 0nT SE ω−  in Eq.(14), and therefore the intensity

Figure 7 illustrates the variation of the signal intensity contrast (S1/S2) with the 
wavelength of the illuminating light source as computed using the original homodyne model 
presented in [15]. Note that in deriving these results, it is assumed that the near-field 
amplitude of sample (S1) is 1.2 times larger than that of (S2) in every radian frequency order, 
i.e. 0 0( 1) ( 2)1.2n nT S S T S SE E− −=ω ω . In other words, the ideal signal intensity contrast has a value of 1.2,

signal contrast diagram may have the discontinuous profile for the order I1ω0 in Fig. 7, which 
is caused by the deconstructive interference between the near-field and background noise in 
Fig. 6.

6.2 S/B ratio and signal contrast of heterodyne detection signal 
Due to the weak intensity of the homodyne detection signal (see Fig. 6), attempting to 
improve the S/B ratio by utilizing conventional A-SNOM techniques such as raising the order 
of the radian frequency used for detection purposes, decreasing the amplitude of the tip 
vibration, A, or increasing the wavelength of the illuminating light source is bound to meet 
with limited success. However, as shown in Fig. 8, the intensity of the heterodyne detection 
signal is far greater than that of the homodyne detection signal. (Note that in computing the 
results presented in Fig. 8, the amplitude of the reference beam is specified as ER=1000 in the 
visible light region). Thus, even if the amplitudes of the background electric fields EP and 
EP_R are amplified by the reference electric field ReferenceE
 
 to the extent that they are equivalent 
to the near-field amplitude 0nT SE
ω
− , the S/B ratio can still be improved by increasing the radian 
frequency order used for detection purposes or decreasing the amplitude of the tip vibration, 
A.  
The following discussions consider the case where the S/B ratio is improved by reducing 
the tip vibration amplitude, A, from 60 nm to 20 nm. By doing so, the amplitude of the DC 
term, 00T SE
ω
− , in the tip enhancement can be assigned a reasonable value of 1.8, while the higher-
order near-field interaction amplitudes are assigned ideally as 0 00 / 3nT S T SE E nω ω− −=  since a Fourier 
analysis reveals that these terms decay more rapidly at smaller values of the tip vibration. 
Note that all the other parameters in Eq. (14) are assumed to have the same values as those 
assigned in subsection 6.1. Figure 9 shows that the S/B ratio of the heterodyne detection 
signal is an order of magnitude higher than that of the homodyne detection signal in the 
visible wavelength region (see Fig. 5). In fact, the S/B ratio obtained from the I
Δω+2ω0 
harmonic component is already sufficiently high for detection purposes without the need to 
consider higher order harmonics. Even though the near-field interaction amplitudes 0nT SE ω−  of 
the heterodyne detection signal decay more rapidly than their homodyne counterparts, the 
background noise is also reduced due to the lower modulation depth ψ3 achieved by 
decreasing the amplitude of the tip vibration A vibration (see Eq. (14).) Significantly, the use 
of a reference electric field ReferenceE
 
 in the heterodyne detection method improves both the 
S/B ratio and the signal intensity compared to the homodyne technique. Thus, as shown in 
Fig. 10, an acceptable signal contrast (i.e. a value close to the ideal value of 1.2) can be 
obtained at harmonic orders as low as the second order, i.e. I
Δω+2ω0, in the visible region 
(compared to the fourth order in the homodyne method).

7. Potential methods for improving S/B ratio of A-SNOM detection signal 
This section discusses various additional techniques for improving the S/B ratio of the 
heterodyne A-SNOM detection signal as suggested by an inspection of the analytical formulae 
presented in Section 3. Subsections 7.1 and 7.2 investigate the correlation between the S/B 
ratio of the heterodyne detection signal and the modulation depth parameter, ψ3, in two 
different regimes, i.e. ψ3 < 1 and ψ3 > 1, respectively. (Note that in performing the analyses, all 
of the parameter values are identical to those considered in subsection 6.2.) Finally, 
subsection 7.3 considers the feasibility of improving the S/B ratio of the heterodyne A-SNOM 
detection signal by replacing the conventional sinusoidal tip vibration modulation function by 
a ramp function. 
7.1 Correlation between S/B ratio and phase modulation depth parameter ψ3 for ψ3 <1 
.Equation (14) shows that the phase modulation depth ψ3 is a highly important parameter since 
its value has a direct effect upon the intensity of the background noise. Thus, intuitively, the 
potential exists for improving the S/B ratio by specifying the value of the modulation depth in 
such a way that the intensity of the background noise is reduced, or even eliminated entirely. 
Figure 11 illustrates the variation of the S/B ratio of the detection signal components I
Δω
 to 
I
Δω+4ω0 with the modulation depth, ψ3 , for ψ3 < 1. It is observed that the S/B ratios tend toward 
infinity as the modulation depth approaches 0 for all harmonic orders other than zero. 
Furthermore, it can be seen that for a given harmonic order, the S/B ratio decays rapidly with 
an increasing modulation depth. However, comparing the various profiles presented in the 
figure, it is apparent that the S/B ratios of the higher-order radian frequency components 
decay more slowly with increasing ψ3 than the lower-order harmonic order components. Thus, 
it is inferred that higher-order intensity signals represent a more suitable choice for heterodyne 
A-SNOM detection purposes.

7.3 Modulation of AFM tip vibration utilizing ramp function 
The sections above have assumed the AFM tip vibration to be modulated by a sinusoidal 
function. This section of the paper investigates the feasibility of utilizing a ramp function in 
place of this sinusoidal function as a means of eliminating the background noise, thereby 
enhancing the S/B ratio. Accordingly, the tip-to-sample distance is reformulated as follows: 
 
0( ) ( )
AZ t Z t m T
T
= + −   (18) 
 
where A and T are the amplitude and period of the ramp function, respectively, and 
( 1)mT t m T≤ ≤ + . m is a positive integer. Substituting Z(t) into the heterodyne intensity 
formulation Ihet(t) given in Eq. (10), it can be shown that

When the modulation depth term in Eq. (17), i.e. ψ3 = 2sin(θ)A/λ, has a value equal to 1, the

+Higher Order Heterodyne Modulation Radian Frequency Terms                           (20). 
Note that in Eq. (20), 0' nT SE ω−  is the Fourier component of the nω0 ramp function used to 
modulate the AFM tip. In contrast to Eq.(14), it can be seen in Eq. (20), that a pure near-field 
intensity signal can theoretically be obtained at radian frequency orders greater than 3 since 
the background noise term corresponding to the scattered tip field reflected from the sample 
surface is eliminated. Therefore, the use of a ramp modulation function appears to offer the 
potential for enhancing the S/B ratio in near-field optical measurement applications; 
particularly when using short illuminating wavelengths, i.e. λ ≒  A according to ψ3 = 
2sin(θ)A/λ. 
It should be also noted that operating with a ramp function also eliminates the topography 
artifact due to the Z-dependant phase modulation when lock-in detection is set at radian 
frequency orders greater than 3.
