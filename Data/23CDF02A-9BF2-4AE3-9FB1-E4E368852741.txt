usedfor displaying proteins on the outer surface of Gram-positive bacteria have also 
been developed (Fig. 5.2b), such as S-layer subunits (10, 11), The basic surface 
protein, BspA anchor protein (12, 13), and N-acetylmuraminidase, AcmA anchor 
protein (14,15). S-layer subunits and BspA are anchored via charge interactions and 
can be extracted from the cell surface with charge occupying agents such as lithium 
chloride. The AcmA anchor protein binds specifically to the peptidoglycan. In most of 
cell surface display systems, the target proteins are displayed by N-terminal fusion to 
the anchoring motif. A new anchor protein PgsA of Bacillus subtilis subsp. 
chungkookjang is able to display the target protein fused to its C terminus. PgsA is a 
transmembrane protein, belongs to one of the poly-γ-glutamate synthetase complexes 
(16). According to Ashiuchi’s study (17), PgsA functions to stabilize the complex by 
anchoring in the cell membrane and may play the role as a poly-γ-glutamate 
transporter. The PgsA protein is expected to be located between the cell surface and 
cyto plasmo-membrane. The transmembrane region only consists of 25 to 44 amino 
acids. The PgsA anchor protein is classified as an A1 type anchor (transmembrane 
anchor) in the system proposed by Leenhouts et al. (18.). Since the transmembrane 
region is located at the N terminus of PgsA, it is expected to be a very useful anchor 
protein for cell surface display of heterologous protein. Hepatitis B is caused by 
infectious Hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is estimated to have infected 350 million 
people throughout the world and is one of the most common human pathogens. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer, is primarily caused by chronic HBV 
infection. Currently, vaccination is the best method to prevent HBV infection. 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small DNA virus. Its genome is a circular and partially 
double stranded DNA consisting of 3.2 kb (19.). Infection by HBV commonly results 
in acute and chronic hepatitis and is also associated with high risks of developing liver 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (20). Immunization against hepatitis B surface

Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). 
Poly-γ-glutamate-producing strain Bacillus subtilis and an Escherichia 
coli/Streptococcus sanguis shuttle vector pVA838 were also obtained from BCRC. 
Vector pBlunt-hbvs containing HBsAg gene was obtained from Dr. Mi-Hua Tao 
(Institute of Biomedical Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan ). 
2.2 Expression vectors construction 
Chromosomal DNA of Bacillus subtilis was isolated using Viogene genomic mini kit 
(Viogene-BioTek, Taipei, Taiwan). The PCR amplification of gene fragments was 
started with template DNA, 0.1 µM specific primers, 0.2 mM dNTP and 10X reaction 
buffer (20 mM MgCl2), and 2 units of Accu DNA polymerase (Yeastern Biotech, 
Taiwan). The primers used in this work are listed in Table 5.2 and the underlined 
region in each primer is the restriction enzyme site. The PCR conditions for 30 cycles 
amplification using the specific primer pairs are as following: (i) Bacillus pgsA gene 
was amplified from the isolated chromosome of Bacillus subtilis using primers 
pgsA-F and pgsA-R at 95 oC for 30 s, 58 oC for 30 s, 72 oC for 90 s; (ii) the HBsAg 
gene was amplified from the pBlunt-hbvs using HBV-F and HBV-R) at 95 oC for 30 
s, 58 oC for 45 s, 72 oC for 50 s. PCR products were purified by using Viogene DNA 
clean up kit (Viogene-BioTek). The vector pRKN provides the critical elements of 
NICE system which includes a 2.2 kb nisRK gene and a 300 bp nisA promoter region 
containing its -35 to -10 area and ribosome-binding site, and a multiple cloning site. 
For the amplification of HBsAg gene, 6xHis tag was designed in the reverse primers 
so that the amplified gene products will carry 6xHis tag on its C-terminal. After 
digestion with proper restriction enzymes, the amplified product of HBsAg was 
inserted into the multiple cloning sites of pRKN and designated as pRKNhbv. 
Plasmid pRKNChbv was generated by inserting the properly digested and purified 
Bacillus pgsA gene into the HBsAg expression vector pRKNhbv. The schematic

buffer plus 8M urea. 
2.5 Immunofluorescence analyses 
After the collected L.lactis cells pellet as washed with PBS buffer, the cell suspension 
was incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-4xHis antibody (Qiagen) for 60 minutes. 
After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated 
anti-mouse IgG Abs (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes. Immunofluorescent images were 
captured using a fluorescence Microscope (Olympus). 
2.6 SDS-PAGE and Western blotting 
Protein samples were analyzed on SDS-PAGE with 8 % gel. The proteins were 
subsequently electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Co., 
Boston, MA) and allowed to react with primary monoclonal mouse anti-4xHis 
antibody (Qiagen) and secondary goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase- 
conjugated antibody (Sigma), after which the membrane was then stained with 
nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4- chloro-3-indolylphosphate according to the 
protocol specified by the supplier. The staining solution was prepared by adding 95 µl 
of NBT and 50 µl of BCIP sequentially to 15 ml of alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 
mM pH 9.0 Tris-HCl containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl2). 
3 Resulted and Discussion 
3.1 Construction and expression of a surface display vector of HBsAg on L. 
lactis 
Two expression vectors (pRKNhbv and pRKNChbv) encoding HBsAg fused with 
polyhistidine tag at C-terminal and a dual-fusion with Bacillus pgsA gene at 
N-terminal and 6x his tag at C-terminal were constructed respectively as shown in 
Figure 4. In order to confirm that target gene was inserted into the vector, colony 
PCR was carried out. DNA electrophoresis analysis of the PCR products is shown in 
Figure 5, A DNA fragment with size about 0.68 kb was observed when HBsAg 
 16
HBsAg was located on the surface of L.lactis. It can be concluded that HBsAg 
fragment was properly and efficiently displayed on the cell surface of L. lactis using 
PgsA as a membrane- anchored protein display motif.
