Abstract 
Anodic TiO2-nanotube (TiNT) arrays and ZnO nanowire arrays were fabricated for use in flexible 
quantum-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) and photoelectrochemical devices. A modified successive ionic 
layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process was used for the deposition of coupled CdS and CdSe quantum 
dots (QDs) on the surface of orientated TiNT and ZnO nanowire arrays. The process promoted uniform QDs 
deposition on the ZnO nanorod arrays while preventing entry clogging.CdS-based QDSSCs exhibited 
conversion efficiency of 1.57 % under AM1.5 illumination. As compared to CdS/TiO2 nanoparticles -based 
QDSSCs, CdS/TiNT-based QDSSCs showed enhanced light-harvesting efficiency, rapid electron-transport 
rate, and prolonged electron lifetime, leading to an increase in efficiency by 20%. We combined CdSe 
nanoparticles and ZnO nanowire arrays to demonstrate a flexible wire-shaped electrode for 
photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation. An array of ZnO nanowires was grown vertically and radially 
outward from a Cu-wire mesh substrate. CdSe nanoparticles were attached to the surface of the orientated 
ZnO nanowires. Such wire-shaped electrode with radially outward orientated CdSe/ZnO nanowires provided 
improved electrolyte mass transport and minimized loss of incident photons. CdSe/ZnO nanowires were 
formed in all directions over the Cu wire, leading to low incident-light-angle dependence. For 
photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation under one-sun irradiation, the wire-shaped electrode device 
outperformed the planar-shaped electrode device by at least 30%

一、 前言 
Since the breakthrough work conducted by O＇Regan and Grätzel in 1991 [1] a type of solar cells 
using transparent conducting glass as substrate for the dye-sensitized TiO2 nanoparticle (NP-TiO2) 
electrode has provided an attractive alternative to silicon-based photovoltaics, with conversion efficiency 
of 11% at a very competitive cost. [2,3] However, the rigid conducting glass has restricted the adaptability 
of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to their heavy weight, high cost, fragility, and shape limitations. 
Therefore, the deposition of NP-TiO2 layer on a lightweight, thin, and flexible substrate for photoanode, 
which offers mobile electricity, is attracting much attention.  
One-dimensional (1-D) metal oxide nanostructured arrays have represented a new generation of 
photoelectrode materials to supply clean and recyclable energy [4-7]. However, the materials being developed 
for photoanode, such as ZnO and TiO2, have been limited by their poor utilization of solar energy. The 
combination of CdS and TiO2 nanotube arrays on opaque Ti substrate, featuring highly decreased 
intercrystalline contacts and vectorial charge transport along the axis, has exhibited impressive 
photoconversion efficiencies in PEC studies [8–10]. However, the uniform deposition of narrow band-gap 
semiconductors to prevent entrance clogging and the high accessibility of outer sunlight to minimize 
incident-light-angle dependence have been technically challenging. 
Frank＇s group reported the application of smooth TiNT arrays for backilluminated DSSCs, an optimum 
of 3.0% was obtained for the TiNT/Ti-based DSSC. [11] Such DSSCs with the opaque metal substrate require 
back side illumination, and their efficiencies are normally much lower than front side illuminated cells [12,13] 
because the incident light partially absorbed by the counterelectrode and the electrolytes. The efficiency is 
inferior to those of NP-TiO2/Ti-based DSSCs that was ascribed to the insufficient surface area for dye 
adsorption. 
Wire-shaped electrodes offer new opportunities for design and fabrication of PV and PEC devices. 
Several wire-shaped PVs based on TiO2 nanoparticles [14] and 1-D nanotubes [15] have recently been 
reported. Zou's group proposed wire-shaped flexible DSSCs by concentrically depositing TiO2 nanoparticles 
around stainless steel mesh [14]. The non-planar structure DSSCs were almost capable of harvesting light 
from any illumination direction and exhibiting a 1.49% conversion efficiency. Misra et al. [15] fabricated 
TiO2 nanotube arrays over Ti mesh using the electrochemical method. Using the wire-shaped TiO2 
nanotubearray electrode in the DSSCs increased the efficiency to 2.78%. So far, only 1-D TiO2 nanotubes 
were anodic grown over the Ti metallic wire, but its application was limited to PV device.  
The multi-QD sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes in PV or PEC devices consist of a film of randomly 
packed TiO2 nanoparticles [16, 17] or orientated arrays of TiO2 nanofibers [18]. Compared with the 
nanoparticulate film, the one-dimensional (1-D) array architecture has higher charge collection efficiency with 
vectorial charge transport along the axis. The well-ordered 1-D structure also makes the nanochannels more 
amenable to QD deposition than the disordered and random mesoporous structure in TiO2 nanoparticulate 
film. The SILAR process in alcohol, instead of water, at a evaluated temperature for a long period of time is 
used to improve the penetration of reacting precursors into the mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticulate film. Under 
these conditions, a two-dimensional (2-D) layer from QD aggregation is formed on the surface of the 
mesoporous TiO2 film instead of three-dimensional heterojunction structures, particularly, CdSe [18] and 
CdTe [19] which have very low solubility product constants.

The obtained electrode was denoted as electrode II. Finally, the resulting samples were annealed in argon 
gas at 400 oC for 1 h. They were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), 
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), 
x-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-visible spectroscopy.  
2.6 QDSSC  
The annealed TiNT film was adhered onto FTO glass using this NP-TiO2 viscous paste which was first 
printed onto FTO glass by doctor blade technique. Immediately, the TiNT film was fixed on the top of 
NP-TiO2 paste under a slight pressure by covering with a slide glass followed by annealing in air at 450℃ for 
30 min. After immersing in 0.05 M TiCl4 solution and annealing, the excess NP-TiO2 portion uncovered by 
the TiNT film was shaved off. The electrode was then immersed in a 0.3 mM (Bu4N)2Ru(dcbpyH)2(NCS)2 
(N719 dye, Solaronix) solution for 24 h. The N719-sensitized electrode was further sandwiched with the 
sputtered-Pt FTO glass, separated by a 75 μm-thick-hot-melt spacer. The intervening space was filled with 
liquid electrolytes of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in dry acetonitrile. 
2.7 Photoelectrochemical water splitting 
Photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation experiments were conducted using a three-electrode configuration 
with Pt wire counter and saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrodes. The electrolyte consisted of 0.35 M Na2SO3 
and 0.24 M Na2S solution. Working electrodes with an area of 0.25 cm2 were illuminated with an AM 1.5 
solar simulator (Oriel). Light intensity was measured using an optical power meter equipped with a calibrated 
thermopile head. 
 
三、結果與討論 
3.1 Surface properties 
Figures 1 (a), 1(c), and 1 (d) exhibit the typical morphology of the 24 μm long TiNT arrays, examined 
by FESEM. The average inner diameter at the top of the nanotube is 115 nm with a wall thickness of 20 nm It 
is easy to obtain a flexible free-standing TiNT film as Fig.1 (c) indicated. Fig.1 2(a) exhibits the typical 
morphology of the Cu mesh with ZnO nanowire arrays examined by FE-SEM. It has 200 meshes, and the 
spacing is 75 μm. Fig. 2(b) shows the well-defined ZnO nanowire arrays grown radially outward on the 
circumference of the Cu wire. Fig. 2(c) depicts that the ZnO nanowire arrays, with length of 2.5 μm and 
diameter of 100 nm, are vertical to the Cu wire substrate. Planar density is about 18 wires/μm2, as shown in 
Fig. 2(d). The photograph of CdSe/ZnO wired shaped electrode exhibited flexible as shown in Fig. 2(e). TEM 
image of a ZnO nanowire decorated with CdSe nanoparticles indicates that the CdSe nanoparticles are 10– 
20 nm in diameter. Elemental information from Fig. 2(f) with EDX in conjunction with the HRTEM is shown 
in Fig. 2(f). The characteristic peaks in the spectrum are associated with O, Zn, Se, and Cd. Quantitative 
analysis reveals that the atomic ratio of Se is close to unity, indicating that the deposits are CdSe. Crystallinity  
properties of CdS/CdSe/ZNR arrays were characterized by XRD and UV-visible spectroscopy. From the XRD 
data in Fig. 3, the CdS/CdSe/ZNR arrays exhibit hexagonal ZnO (100), (002), and (101), hexagonal CdS 
(100), (002), and (101), and hexagonal CdSe (100), (110), and (112) peaks. 
3.2 Electron-transport properties 
 8
Although many factors related to photoelectrochemical performancecan be optimized in this system, the 
photocurrent density achieved in this study is significantly improved. Therefore, we expect that the 
wire-shaped nanostructured electrode may potentially be applied in various photocatalytic and 
photoelectrocatalytic fields, such as environmental purification and heterojunction solar cells.
