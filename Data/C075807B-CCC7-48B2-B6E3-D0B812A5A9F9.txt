A 30 GHz Active Quasi-Circulator with
Current-Reuse Technique in 0.18 µm CMOS
Technology
Chia-Hao Chang, Yu-Tsung Lo, Student Member, IEEE, and Jean-Fu Kiang, Member, IEEE
Abstract— An active quasi-circulator at 30 GHz is designed and
fabricated in TSMC 0.18 µm RF mixed signal CMOS technology.
The current-reuse technique is integrated with a common-source
stage to form the quasi-circulator core while reducing the
power consumption at the same time. The transmitter-to-receiver
leakage is alleviated by the out-of-phase cancellation of signals
from two paths. The isolation and insertion loss between other
pairs of ports are improved with buffer stages. All the measured
isolations are higher than 12 dB, all the insertion losses are lower
than 7.9 dB, and the total power consumption is 15 mW.
Index Terms— Circulator, quasi-circulator, active-circulator,
current-reuse, MMIC, CMOS.
I. INTRODUCTION
Three-port circulators are commonly used in microwave
and millimeter-wave systems to decouple the transmitted and
received signal paths [1]. For example, it allows the transmitter
and the receiver to share a common antenna in FMCW radars
[2]. An ideal three-port passive circulator is specified as
|S21| = |S32| = |S13| = 1 and the other scattering parameters
being 0. Circulators can be implemented in integrated circuit,
which has the advantages of small size, low cost, and being
integratable with RF and baseband modules on a single chip
[3].
A quasi-circulator is a special type of circulator with its
receiver port isolated from its transmitter port, or |S13| = 0.
Several active quasi-circulators have been reported in recent
years. In [4], transistors with common-source, common-gate,
and common-drain topologies are integrated to improve the
isolations. In [5], a phase shifter is used to improve the
isolation between two specific ports. In [6], an active balun and
two transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) are used to design a
quasi-circulator without inductors.
In this work, an active quasi-circulator is designed to operate
at 30 GHz, which is far beyond the operating frequency of
CMOS circulators reported in the literatures. The current-reuse
technique is integrated with a common-source stage to form
the quasi-circulator core. Two common-source buffers are used
to compensate for the loss at high frequencies, which also

improve the isolation. The out-of-phase cancellation technique
is applied to reduce |S31|.
II. CIRCUIT DESIGN
Fig. 1 (a) shows the core of a three-port quasi-circulator,
which consists of a common-drain transistor M1, a common-
gate transistor M2, and a common-source transistor M3. In
this work, ports 1, 2 and 3 are connected to the transmitter,
the antenna and the receiver, respectively.
The source terminals of M1 and M2 are connected to
form an active balun. The phase difference between the drain
terminals of M1 and M2 is 180◦. The transistor M3 is
connected in parallel to M1 and M2. The drain terminals
of M3 and M1 are in phase, and those of M3 and M2 are
out of phase. The signals between ports 1 and 3 are canceled
by connecting the drain terminals of M3 and M2 together.
A current source made of an NMOS transistor is typically
connected to the source terminals of M1 and M2. The signal
can be fed either at the drain of the current source to get better
input matching, or the gate of the current source to get another
transconductance gain.
Fig. 1(b) shows an alternative configuration without the
current source, and the original NMOS M2 is replaced by
a PMOS P1. The signal from/to port 2 (antenna) is coupled to
the source terminals of M2 and P1 through on-chip capacitors.
In this manner, the dc current flowing through M1 is reused by
P2, hence the dc current is only half of that used in Fig. 1(a).
Since the voltage headroom of the current-reuse circulator is
slightly higher than that in Fig. 1(a), the power is saved by
slightly lower than 50 %.
Fig. 2 shows the proposed active quasi-circulator. The core
consists of a common-drain transistor M3, a common-gate
transistor P1, and a common-source transistor M2. At higher

maintaining comparative performance. So far as we know,
this circulator operates at the highst frequency among those
implemented in CMOS technology.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
An active quasi-circulator at 30 GHz is designed and
fabricated in TSMC 0.18 µm CMOS technology. The insertion
loss is between 4 - 6 dB from the transmitter to the antenna,
and 7.2 - 7.9 dB from the antenna to the receiver, the worst
isolation is 12 dB. By integrating the current-reuse technique,
the power consumption in the circulator core is reduced to
5.6 mW. The insertion losses and the isolation parameters (
except IS31 ) can be improved using two buffer stages at the
transmitter and the receiver ports. Better performance can be
achieved at the cost of more dc power consumption.

which implies that a smaller antenna is endowed with a larger
quality factor. To increace the impedance bandwidth of a dual-
meander folded loop, a disk-loaded monopole is placed inside
the former. A resonant mode of the disk-loaded monopole is
excited by properly adjusting the gap width g between the disk
and one surface of the dual meanders.
The resonant bands associated with the dual-meander and
the disk-loaded monopole, respectively, merge into one if the
width of the square disk, Ld, and the gap width g are properly
adjusted. Note that larger Ld gives a larger overlapping area
between the disk and the dual-meander strips, hence stronger
capacitive coupling.
From another point of view, the disk-loaded monople serves
as a parasitic element to the dual-meander loop. Over the band
of interest where two resonant bands merge, the electrical
length of the dual-meander loop is about one wavelength. The
disk-loaded monople is coupled to an adjacent meander strip,
effectively extending its electrical length to about one-quarter
wavelength. Hence, the physical size of the monopole plus the
disk can be much shorter than one-quarter wavelengths.

Lx = 20, Ly = 20, Lz = 19.8, Gx = 130, Gy = 110, a1 = 7.5, b1 = 1,
a2 = 5, a = 4.5, b = 4.7, d = 1, w = 2, g = 1, D = 1, Ld = 14.7, all in
mm.
Fig. 3 shows the measured and simulated reflection coeffi-
cients of the proposed antenna using HFSS. The antenna takes
a cubic space of 20×20×19.8 mm3, mounted on a 110×130
mm2 horizontal ground plane. The center frequency is about
1.495 GHz, and the 10-dB bandwidth is about 161 MHz, hence
its fractional bandwidth is about 10.8%. The measurement and
simulation results match fairly.
Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) show the side view of the simulated
surface current distribution at 1.445 and 1.545 GHz, respec-
tively. The surface current on the meander of the opposite side
is the same due to symmetry. The one-wavelength resonance
of the dual-meander folded loop appears at about 1.445 GHz.
At 1.545 GHz, the quarter-wavelength resonance occurs, the
current flows uniformly along the vertical part of the monopole
to the disk, then is capacitively coupled to the meander strips
underneath, as shown in Fig. 4(b).
Fig. 5 shows the comparison of simulated reflection co-
efficients with and without the disk-loaded monopole. In the

in the x - y plane is nearly omni-directional. The cross-
polarization is about 10 dB lower than the co-polarization.
The measured peak gain is 0.7 dBi.
Fig. 9 shows the measured antenna gain which is posi-
tive over the whole band. The gain is lower than that of
conventional dipoles because part of the currents along the
folded lines flow in opposite direction, and their radiated
fields partially cancel each other. Fig. 10 shows the measured
radiation efficiency of the proposed antenna exceeds 65 % over
the whole band, which is obtained using the full 3-D pattern
integration in the anechoic chamber of our laboratory.
Fig. 11 shows the photograph of the proposed antenna. Four
paper pads are inserted to make the structure rigid. A slight
frequency shift may be contributed by these paper pads.

IV. EFFECT OF GROUND PLANE SIZE
The effect of ground plane size on the antenna performance
has been analyzed. The bandwidth of the antenna with a larger
ground plane, for example, 400 mm × 400 mm or 2λ × 2λ,
is about 13.8 %, and the peak gain appears at θ = 45◦. The
bandwidth of the antenna with a smaller ground plane, for
example, 50 mm × 50 mm or 0.25λ× 0.25λ, is about 2.5 %,
and the peak gain appears at θ = 90◦.
With a smaller ground plane, it is difficult to tune the input
impedances of the two resonant modes to 50Ω at the same
time Although the impedance bandwidth with a larger ground
plane is much wider than that with a smaller one, the radiation
pattern is not dipole-like and the gain turns negative in the x-y
plane.
An electrically small meander-line antenna of dimension
0.08λ over a finite ground plane of 0.71λ×0.71λ is proposed
in [19], the peak gain appears at θ = 45◦. A dual-meander-
line antenna of dimension 0.12λ placed at the center of a

agreement between measurement and simulation results is
observed. The measured reflection coefficient appears lower
than the simulated one because the conductor loss of the
copper strips and the ground plane reduces the amount of
reflected power.
Fig. 4 shows the comparison of simulated reflection coeffi-
cients with and without the disk-loaded monopole. Without
the disk-loaded monopole, the fractional bandwidth of the
folded-loop alone is about 4.4 %. By inserting the disk-loaded
monopole, another resonant mode appears and the bandwidth
is increased to 11.2 %.

Fig. 4. Comparison of measured reflection coefficient (——) with disk-
loaded monopole and simulated reflection coefficient (− −−) without disk-
loaded monopole, parameters are the same as in Fig. 3.
The total length of the folded loop is 201 mm, about 0.94
wavelengths at 1.4 GHz. Similarly, the total length of the disk-
loaded monopole is 40 mm, about 0.207 wavelengths at 1.875
GHz.
As shown in Fig. 4, the resonant frequency of the first mode
is increased from 1.4 to 1.45 GHz and that of the second mode
is decreased from 1.875 to 1.55 GHz after the disk-loaded
monopole is inserted and coupled with the folded loop via
the capacitive path between the disk of the monopole and the
parasitic patches extended from the folded loop.
Fig. 5 shows the simulated reflection coefficient versus the
gap size between the disk and the parasitic patches. With a
smaller g, the second resonant frequency tends to decrease
because the capacitive coupling becomes stronger and the
effective length of the disk-loaded monopole is extended. The
optimum gap size is about 0.5 mm.

英文：A small broadband antenna composed of a dual meander folded 
loop and a disk-loaded monopole is designed and measured. Its size is 
0.1λ ×0.1λ ×0.098λ  and is mounted on a horizontal ground plane of 
0.55λ ×0.65λ  at the center frequency of 1.495 GHz.  Measurement 
results confirm a fractional bandwidth of 10.8 % with the voltage 
standing-wave ratio (VSWR) less than 2. The measured radiation 
efficiency exceeds 65 % over the whole band. This antenna has an 
omni-directional radiation pattern of vertical polarization in the 
horizontal plane. The ground plane size is optimized to meet three 
design goals: Dipole-like radiation pattern with positive gain in the x-y 
plane, smaller than λ /10 of structure size above ground, and more 
than 10 % of impedance bandwidth.

Small Broadband Antenna Composed of Dual-meander
Folded Loop and Disk-loaded Monopole

With the raised demand for smaller wireless devices, small antennas with low profile,
light weight and easy fabrication have been widely explored. As the antenna size
decreases, its bandwidth tends to reduce due to a higher quality factor, thus results
in narrower impedance bandwidth.
Different techniques have been used to reduce antenna size. For example, high-
permittivity substrates have been used to reduce the resonant frequency of anten-
nas, top-loading patch and meander-line have been used to increase the effective
current path, folding technique has been used to reduce the overall size of anten-
nas, inductive or capacitive elements have also been used to increase the current
path and thus reduce the resonant frequency. When applying these miniaturization
techniques, the antenna efficiency usually degrades and the impedance bandwidth
becomes narrower. Recently, bandwidth enhancement techniques have been stud-
ied. Mode coupling between proximity elements is used to increase the impedance
bandwidth.
In this work, a small broadband antenna composed of dual-meander folded loop and
a disk-loaded monopole is presented. The folding technique is applied to a dual-
meander loop to reduce the antenna height. A disk-loaded monopole is placed inside
the dual-meander folded loop to increace the overall impedance bandwidth. Another
resonance is obtained by properly adjusting the gap width between the square disk
and the dual meanders. The antenna has a volume of 0.1λ×0.1λ×0.098λ, designed
at the center frequency of 1.495 GHz. Measurement results confirm a fractional
bandwidth of 10.8% with the voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) less than 2.
In the target bands where two resonsnt bands merge, the electric length of the
dual-meander loop is about one wavelength. The electric length of the disk-loaded
monopole coupled to the adjacent meander strip is effectively extended to about
one-quarter wavelengths, although the physical size of the monopole plus the disk
is significantly shorter than one-quarter wavelengths. Noe that by placing a disk-
loaded monopole inside the main radiator does not increase the antenna volume.
A Small Wideband Folded-Loop Antenna with Three Coupled
Modes

Wireless communication technologies and applications have grown tremendously
and demand antennas with better performance, smaller size and wider bandwidth.
Electrically small antennas are understood as antennas with a size smaller than one-
sixth wavelength. In general, small antennas have high quality factor and narrow
bandwidth.
Different techniques have been used to reduce the antenna size. For example, fractal
antennas have been designed as small antennas due to their self-similar geometry.
Meander lines and folding technique have been used to reduce the antenna size.
Very high permittivity or magneto-dielectric materials have been used to design
dielectric loaded antennas with reduced resonant frequency and reduced electrical
length. Inductive or capacitive elements can be loaded to an antenna to extend the
electric length, hence reducing the resonant frequency.
Miniaturization techniques usually result in poor efficiency and radiation gain, as
well as narrower impedance bandwidth. There are techniques to increase the impedance
bandwidth, for example, using parasitic elements to excite another resonant mode,
cutting slots on patch antennas, adding additional wires to create multiple resonant
paths to widen the bandwidth.
In this work, a small wideband folded loop antenna with coupling of three resonant
modes is proposed. The meander line and the folding technique are used to reduce
the height and the lateral size, respectively, of the antenna. A disk-loaded monopole
is placed inside the folded loop to increase the overall impedance bandwidth without
increasing the antenna size. Two rectangular patches are added onto the folded loop
to induce coupling between the folded loop and the disk-loaded monopole. Another
resonant mode is created due to the coupling between the disk-loaded monopole and
part of the folded loop.
The disk-loaded monopole has an effective electric length of about one-quater wave-
lengths, although its physical size is significantly shorter than one-quarter wave-
length due to the coupling between the rectangular patches and the disk-loaded
monopole. Another monopole loaded with spiral line is placed inside the folded
loop antenna and underneath the rectangular patches to induce a third resonant
mode. The impedance bandwidth can be further extended as in the unfolded me-
ander loop, but the size is much smaller than its planar counterpart.
