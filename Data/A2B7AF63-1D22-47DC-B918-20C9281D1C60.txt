ABSTRACT 
This paper proposes a face recognition method using artificial 
immune network classifiers based on Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA). The PCA abstracts principal eigenvectors of the 
image in order to get best feature description, hence to reduce the 
number of inputs of immune networks. After this, these image 
data of reduced dimensions are input into an immune network to 
be trained. Subsequently the antibodies of the immune networks 
are optimized using genetic algorithms. The performance of the 
present method was evaluated using the AT&T Laboratories 
Cambridge database (formerly called ORL face database). The 
results show that this method gains higher recognition rate in 
contrast with some other methods.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Face recognition is a visual pattern recognition problem. A three-
dimensional face to varying illumination, pose, and expression is 
to be identified based on its two-dimensional image. In general, a 
face recognition system consists of four modules: detection, 
alignment, feature extraction, and matching, where localization 
and normalization (i.e. face detection and alignment) are 
processing steps before face recognition (i.e. facial feature 
extraction and matching) is performed. 
Face recognition has drawn considerable interest and attention 
from many researchers for the last two decades. The recognition 
of faces has received extensive attention due to its potential 
applications in many fields such as identification for law 
enforcement, matching of photographs on passports or driver’s 
licenses, access control to secure computer networks and facilities, 
authentication for secure banking and financial transactions, 
automatic screening at airports for known terrorists, and video 
surveillance usage [6]. The purpose of face recognition is to 
identify or verify one or more persons from still/video images of a 
scene through a stored database of faces. Face recognition has 
several advantages over other biometric technologies since it is 
natural, nonintrusive, thereby the people can access it in 
comfortable. Moreover, it can be used anywhere and employed in 
various applications. Consequently, facial features scored the 
highest compatibility among the six biometric attributes 
considered by Hietmeyer [16]. A recent survey of face recognition 
techniques can be found easily in literature [1, 25, 33, 38]. 
Face recognition results depend highly on features that are 
extracted to represent the face pattern and classification methods 
used to distinguish between faces. The face representation was 
performed by using two categories. The first category is global 
approach or appearance-based, which uses holistic texture features 
and is applied to the face or specific region of it. The second one 
is feature-based or component-based, which uses the geometric 
relationship among the facial features like mouth, nose, and eyes. 
Among the appearance-based approach, principal components 
analysis (PCA) method [35] which is also called eigenfaces [31, 
37] is used most widely over the world. PCA based approaches 
typically include two phases: training and classification. In the 
training phase, an eigenspace is established from the training 
samples using PCA and the training face images are mapped to the 
eigenspace for classification. As to the classification phase, an 
input face is projected to the same eigenspace and classified by 
appropriate classifiers. 
In the field of pattern recognition, the combination of an ensemble 
of classifiers can achieve image classification systems with higher 
performance in comparison with a single classifier in that the 
deficiencies of each classifier may be compensated each other. 
This has been verified experimentally in [14, 18, 23]. A number of 
image classification systems based on the combination of outputs 
of different classifier systems have been proposed. Different 
structures for combining classifier systems can be grouped in three 
configurations: cascade, parallel and hybrid [18, 23]. In this paper, 
we proposed a novel face recognition method based on the PCA 
followed by an immune network called PCA-IN. The recognition 
mechanism consists of two phases: the PCA feature extraction 
phase, and the immune network classification phase. The Immune 
networks are utilized as individual classifiers. Figure 1 shows the

Figure 2. Illustration of the biological immune system 
When an infectious foreign pathogen attacks the human body, the 
macrophage has surface receptors to detect and destroy the 
invader.  Then the macrophage becomes an Antigen Presenting 
Cell (APC). The APC interprets the antigen appendage and 
extracts the features, by processing and presenting antigenic 
peptides on its surface to T-cell and B-cell. These antigenic 
peptides are kinds of molecules called MHC (Major 
Histocompatibility Complex) to distinguish a “self” from other 
“non-self” (antigen). These lymphocytes will be capable to 
sensitize this antigen and be activated. Then the Helper T-cell 
releases the interleukines which are the stimulation or suppression 
signals acting on the cells. In the other hand, B-cell becomes 
stimulated when an antibody receptor binds to an antigen. 
Moreover, B-cells are also affected by Helper T-cells during the 
immune responses. The Helper T-cell plays a remarkable key role 
for deciding the immune system toward the cell mediated 
immunity or the humoral immunity, and connects the non-specific 
immune response to make a more efficiency specific immune 
response. 
Affinity maturation occurs when the maturation rate of a B-cell 
clone increases in response to a match between the clone’s 
antibody and an antigen. Subsequently, those mutant cells are 
bound more tightly and stimulated to divide more rapidly. Affinity 
maturation dynamically balances exploration versus exploitation 
in adaptive immunity. It has been demonstrated that the immune 
system has the capability to recognize foreign pathogens, learn 
and memorize, process information, and discriminate between self 
and non-self [32]. Inspired by self-nonself discrimination of 
natural immune system, Forrest et al. [13] proposed a negative-
selection algorithm to detect any novelty. In addition, the 
immunity can be maintained even faced with a dynamically 
changing environment. The biological immune system is generally 
viewed as a mechanism of a highly adaptive, learning, distributed, 
and detection system. In addition, it can recognize different 
pathogen patterns and generate selective immune responses. 
Recognition is achieved by inter-cellular binding, which is 
determined by molecule shape and electrostatic charge. Hence, B-
cell becomes stimulated when an antibody receptor binds to an 
antigen. Antibodies have the capability of binding pathogens that 
they have never learned to recognize. This kind of anticipatory 
capability is due to a broad coverage of pathogen space realized 
by the antibody receptors produced by the immune system. 
Jerne [20] has proposed the idiotypic network hypothesis (immune 
network hypothesis) based on mutual stimulus and suppression 
between antibodies shown in Figure 3. This hypothesis is modeled 
as a differential equation simulating the concentration of a set of 
lymphocytes. The concept of immune network states that the 
network dynamically maintains the memory using a feedback 
mechanism within the network. Jerne concluded that the immune 
system is similar to the nervous system when viewed as a 
functional network. Based on Jerne’s immune network hypothesis, 
several theories and mathematical models for immune system 
have been developed [5, 12, 19].

The following equations proposed by Farmer et al. [12] were 
emoployed to calculate the variation on the concentration of 
antibodies in an immune network.

shows the stimulation, while the second term depicts the 
suppressive interaction between the antibodies. The third term is 
the stimulus from the antigen, and the final term is the natural 
extinction term, which indicates the dissipation tendency in the 
absence of any interaction. Equation (2) is a squashing function to 
ensure the stability of the concentration. 
On the other hand, Hightower et al. [17] suggested that all 
possible antigens could be declared as a group of set points in an

the first step, the individuals of mating pairs are chosen form the 
mating pool of population. Then transaction of chromosome 
segments between mating pairs is performed in the second step.  
Different crossover operators have been proposed to decrease the 
probability of disruption of strongly fitted schemata during the 
search process. 
The purpose of mutation is to introduce genetic diversity into the 
population. A random number is generated and it is checked with 
the probability of mutation. If the random number is less than the 
probability of mutation, the selected chromosome has to undergo 
mutation. Typically the mutation rate lies in 0.001 to 0.01.  Both 
the crossover and mutation operators are the sources of 
exploration. They will disrupt some of the schemata on which 
they operate.  In the process of genetic search, there is a tradeoff 
between exploitation (i.e. reproduction) and exploration (i.e. 
crossover and mutation). The difficulty of genetic algorithms is 
seeking the balance between exploitation and exploration that 
determine the convergence and diversity of the optimal search.

5. EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION 
 To evaluate the performance of the proposed PCA-IN, 
experimental studies are carried out on the AT&T laboratories 
database of faces (formerly, also referred to as “The ORL 
database”) images of Cambridge University. The ORL database 
contains 400 face images from 40 individuals in different states. 
The total number of images for each person is 10. None of the 10 
samples is identical to any other. They vary in position, rotation, 
scale and expression. The changes in orientation have been 
accomplished by rotating the person a maximum of 20° in the 
same plane; also each person has changed his/her facial expression 
in each of 10 samples (open/closed eye, smiling/not smiling). The 
changes in scale have been achieved by changing the distance 
between the person and the video camera. For some individuals, 
the images were taken at different time, varying facial details 
(glasses/no glasses). In addition, each image was digitized and 
presented by a 112 × 92 pixel array whose gray levels ranged 
between 0 and 255. Thumbnails of all of the images are shown in 
Figure 5. 
To test the recognition performance of the proposed PCA-IN, all 
experiments were executed with randomly selected 5 training 
images and 5 test images per person for a total of 200 training 
images and 200 test images. There is no overlap between the 
training and test sets. We run experiments for 15 times, and the 
average rate is used to evaluate the classification performance. 
The face recognition system has been implemented in C++ 
programming language on a Pentium 3.0 GHz computer with 1G 
RAM running on Window XP. A simulation window of face 
recognition, its setting parameters, and the results are all shown in 
Figure 6. In this figure, five images with red block are employed 
for training, while the image with yellow block is used for testing. 
It shows that the PCA-IN correctly recognizes the image as the 
32nd person. Moreover, the information indicated in the top right 
side block shows that the recognition rate of the 40 immune 
network classifiers is 100%. It takes 2 to 15 min to optimize the 
PCA-IN dependent on the number of antibodies of the 40 immune 
classifiers from 1 to 40 respectively. However, once the whole 
PCA-IN (consisting 40 immune network classifiers) is determined, 
it takes less than 10 ms second to recognize a face.

First of all, PCA is adopted to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
of the face images. In order to reduce the amount of arithmetic 
operation without losing any important recognition information, 
eigenvectors that accord with the first 20 max eigenvalues are 
picked. Then the randomly selected training samples that have
