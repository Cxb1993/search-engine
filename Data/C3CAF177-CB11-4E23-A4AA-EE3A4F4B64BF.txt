ABSTRACT 
 
Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral 
developmental disorder, 78.8% of disorders are inherent; MRI studies showed that 
subjects with ADHD have lower secretion volume of brain dopamine and 
norepinephrine of cerebellum, basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex. The 
imbalanced chemical transportation has been thought as the major cause of attention 
deficit and hyperactivity, which results in coordinate disorders such as poor gross 
motor skills as well as poor sensory integration ability. Hippotherapy has been used 
as alternative therapy means to provide rhythmic multi-sensory inputs to regulate the 
subject’s posture stability, balance control as well as to increase cognitive arousal. 
Evidently, children with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy show a great benefit in 
improving the dynamic posture balance. However, few studies have been 
investigated on the effect of ADHD children. 
Except the Pitch at L5 segment, all ROM were non-significant before test 
between two groups. After intervention the ADHD group had average improvement 
of ROM at the head by 20 %; neck by 14 %; L5 by 20 % and CoG sway by 18 %. To 
further discriminate the efficacy the best five improved ADHD were compared to the 
normal group and the result showed significant improvement after intervention in the 
task of CTSIB-4 A/P sway, Max speed, Task 6 total trajectory, Max speed and total 
sway area, single stance task 2 in A/P sway, Max speed. In comparison with 
pre-intervention normal group, it showed significant improvement in CTSIB task 4 
of A/P, M/L sway, Max speed, Sway area, Task 5 sway area, task 6, total travel path, 
and max speed. 
In conclusion, the ADHD children performed poor visual and vestibular sensory 
with the normal subjects, after Hippo intervention, a profound improvement in 
vestibular sensing (better single stance ability), followed by somatosensory 
improvement ( CTSIB task4,a nd 6), and the visual effect was less effect. The 
commercial hippo simulator apparently is a useful rehabilitation means to improve 
the coordination and posture control ability for the ADHD subjects; the implication 
of augmented reality should provide the good visual bio-feedback to further 
improvement the coordinate disorder.

Chapter 1 Introduction 
1.1 Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral 
developmental disorder. It is primarily characterized by the co-existence of attention 
problems and hyperactivity and is one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders 
in school-aged children (Buderath et al., 2009; Piek & Dyck, 2004). ADHD is one of 
the most common disorders during childhood and affects approximately 3-7% of 
general childhood-age population; males are three to four times suspected higher than 
females. The survey suggests that most classrooms may very well have at least one 
child with ADHD (APA, 2000; Barkley et al., 1990; Campbell et al., 2000). 
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Text-Revision 
(DSM-IV-TR), classifies the ADHD into three sub-types namely: predominantly 
hyperactive, predominantly inattentive and combined type (APA, 2000), based on the 
clinical symptoms assessment of difficult staying focus and paying attention, difficult 
controlling behavior and hyperactivity (over-activity) (NIH, 2008). MRI studies 
showed that subjects with ADHD have lower secretion volume of brain dopamine and 
norepinephrine of cerebellum, basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex. The imbalanced 
chemical transportation has been thought as the major cause of attention deficit and 
hyperactivity (Barclay et al., 2003; Courvoisie et al., 2003; Flapper et al., 2008; 
Jacobs et al., 2007). Besides the core symptoms some research also confirmed that 
ADHD children inhibit coordinate disorders such as poor gross motor skills (Piek et 
al., 1999; Tseng et al., 2004), poor balance ability (Piek et al., 1999; Raberger & 
Wimmer, 2003; Tseng et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2003) and poor sensory integration 
ability (VandenBerg, 2001; Wang et al., 2003). 
1.2 Postural control 
      Postural control involves controlling the body’s position in space for the dual 
purposes of stability and orientation. Postural orientation is defined as the ability to 
maintain an appropriate relationship between the body segments and between the 
body and the environment for a task (Horak & Macpherson, 1996). For human 
subjects, the ability to maintain a balanced upright posture (i.e., postural control), 
depends on the interaction of the sensory organization and the motor coordination 
components of the neurological system and the musculoskeletal system (Nouillot& 
Bouisset, 1992). Children’s balance control system and posture control are related, 
moreover, the mechanism of nuclei basales and cerebellum are related to motion 
 3 
 
easy. These have prevented horseback riding from becoming popular. There is a need 
for a Hippo-Simulator to train prospective riders without the expensive horse which 
should provide similar motions to the rider under various gaits such as a walk, trot and 
canter (黃翊凱 2010). Recent years, hippotherapy has become very popular among 
curing cerebral palsy children (Figure 1.2) (Sterba, 2007). 
However, few have been studied on the similar effect to ADHD children. 
 
Chapter 2  Literature Review 
2.1 Postural control in children with ADHD 
Balance and postural maintenance require sensory information from visual, 
vestibular, and somatosensory systems. The balance impairment might be due to 
dysfunction of each of the three systems or their integration. In addition to the three 
major characters of ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), the vestibular and 
cerebellar dysfunction result in abnormal sensory integration of visual, somatosensory, 
vestibular function, poor space coordination and dynamic posture control. Since the 
balance or postural control in children is associated with motor control and motor 
control is associated with the basal ganglia and cerebellum that are engaged in 
cognition and emotional function. Balance ability can be defined as the ability to 
maintain base of support, and can divided into static balance and dynamic balance. 
Regardless of static balance or dynamic balance refers to maintain balance ability 
under contraction of the muscle. Static balance usually refers to control body when 
motionless situation, dynamic balance is the posture maintains ability during body 
movements. Besides, some external forces interference is tasks like produce a 
dynamic interference; it also requires the dynamic balance control ability. Therefore, 
static balance is the balance ability when the ground and base of support has no 
moving. Dynamic balance is the balance ability when the ground and base of support 
has moving or with external forces interference (Magill, 2004; Shumway-Cook & 
Woollacott, 2007). Tseng and other researchers explored the relationship between 
motor performance and core symptoms for ADHD children. These studies collected 
only children with ADHD-C, including 42 ADHD-C children and 42 normal children 
as control group, using Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP) and 
Gordon Diagnostic System (GDS), and stop drug-using 24hr before the test. Results 
showed that ADHD-C children had worse performance than normal children in gross 
and fine motor abilities, especially in balanced performance. This study also believe 
that sustained attention was related with gross and fine motor abilities and could also 
 5 
 
assess the effect of visual and somatosensory inputs on ADHD children’s balance 
ability. 38 children (26 males and 12 females), aged 7.6~12.5, who met the ADHD 
criteria of DSM-IV were included in the study. 49 normal children (27 males and 22 
females) aged 7.5~12.0 were also included in the study. The subject was asked to 
stand up straight at appointed place on the platform and try to keep their body stable. 
The four test tasks including: (1) stand on firm pad with eyes open (FirEO), in which, 
all visual, somatosensory and vestibular inputs interacted on balance; (2) firm surface 
with eyes closed (FirEC), in which visual input was removed; (3) stand on foam pad 
with eyes open (FoaEO), in which somatosensory input was reduced; (4) stand on 
foam pad with eyes closed (FoaEC), in which visual input was removed and 
somatosensory input was reduced. The dynamic center of gravity (COG) of the 
subject was calculated and sway velocity (SV, degree/sec) during a certain period was 
obtained. Results showed that SV on the FirEC, FoaEO and FoaEC tasks was 
significantly greater for ADHD children than in controls, though the difference was 
not significant, SV on the FirEO task tended to be higher for ADHD children. Authors 
concluded that the sensory inputs, the sensory integration, and/or the inhibition of 
excessive movement are impaired for ADHD children, which result in the balance 
dysfunction (Zang et al., 2002). 
Wang (2003) and other researchers explored the difference of 80 ADHD children 
and 80 normal children in balance functions, Balance Master 6.1 (Neuro. Com) were 
used to determined children’s balance ability. During the assessment, the subjects 
were asked to stand up straight under 6 different tasks, including (1) stand on firm pad 
with eyes open (FS/EO), in which, all visual, somatosensory and vestibular inputs 
interacted on balance; (2) firm surface with eyes closed (FS/EC), more body sway 
represent the somatosensory sense or input may have problem; (3) stand on foam 
surface with eyes open (Fos/EO) , more body sway represent the visual sense or input 
may have problem; (4) stand on foam surface with eyes closed (Fos/EC), more body 
sway represent the vestibular sense or input may have problem; (5) unilateral stance 
with eyes open (US/EO), in which somatosensory input was reduced, body instability 
or fall represent their have problem using visual sense to maintain balance; (6) 
unilateral stance with eyes close (US/EC), in which visual input was removed and 
somatosensory input was reduced, body instability or fall represent problem using 
somatosensory input to maintain balance. In addition, sensory integration check scale, 
Conner scale and C-WISC scale were used to determine clinical cognitive function. 
Classification and regression tress (CART) was used to precede statistical analysis. 
Results demonstrated that in all tasks, body sway of ADHD children were all 
significantly higher than the control group, after analyzed with CART, there were 
correlations between the result of sway velocity under the task of FoS/EC and the 
 7 
 
time (Bracher, 2000). Some literatures indicated that horseback riding therapy 
provided a wide range of sensory stimulated input, and tried to link the sensory 
integration theory with occupational therapy (Bracher, 2000; Meregillano, 2004). 
Yack and other researchers were to explore the effect of a four-week therapeutic 
horseback riding on balance performance of children with attention deficit disorders. 
Two male children, ages 9 and 10 who scored more than two standard deviations 
below scores on the balance subtest of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor 
Proficiency (BOTMP) participated in the study. Volunteers rode a horse for one hour, 
three times a week, and for four weeks. Balance ability was measured twice a week 
during the week prior to the start and the end of the riding program. Standing balance 
was assessed of the Pediatric Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction for Balance 
(PCTSIB), walking balance was assessed by measuring the smoothness of their 
walking patterns using vertical, medial-lateral, anterior-posterior head and trunk 
accelerations. Results showed that one subject had improved in PCTSIB, but 
remained unchanged for the other subject. After the completion of the therapeutic 
horseback riding, the balance subtest of the BOTMP was repeated, and showed the 
scores for both subjects had improved to be within one standard deviation of 
normative scores. When these results were taken together with the results of BOTMP, 
authors concluded that the improvements on the balance of these children were 
associated with the therapeutic horseback riding (Yack et al., 1997). In this study, the 
sample size was too small, authors cannot use statistics to analysis the results. Besides, 
two of the subjects had no diagnosis of ADHD from clinical determination, and 
authors only used PCTSIB and BOTMP as outcome measures. 
Mao (2006) investigated the balance ability and sensory modulation ability in 
children with ADHD. 40 children participated in this study and divided in two groups, 
ADHD group (N=20) and normal group (N=20), the balance abilities and sensory 
modulation abilities of subjects were tested, including assessment the dynamic 
posture control abilities while riding on Hippo-Simulator. In this study, they use 
BOTMP, MABC, deviation of the sway area, Anterior-posterior (AP) and 
medial-lateral (ML) direction trajectory differences while riding on Hippo-Simulator 
as outcome measurement. Results showed significant difference in the scores of 
BOTMP, MABC and dynamic posture control abilities while riding on 
Hippo-Simulator between ADHD and normal children. While riding on the horse 
riding machine, basic posture had significant difference in AP and ML direction 
trajectory, but under non-support status only ML direction trajectory had significant 
difference between 2 groups. Author also performed a course of 12-weeks therapeutic 
horseback riding (Speed 1.29 Hz, 30 minutes per time, 3 times per week) on 
Hippo-Simulator for 1 ADHD children (female, 9.67 y/o). The ADHD children did 
 9 
 
1990). In this study, we would like to describe a single-leg stance test on the force 
plate to quantify both ADHD children and typically developing children’s ability to 
maintain single limb support after therapeutic horseback riding. 
2.3.3 Correlation of CoP measurements with postural control 
The most frequently used technique to assess postural stability, both static and 
dynamic, was the measurement of the position and displacement of the center of 
pressure (COP) using a force plate form (Birmingham, 2000; Brouwer, 1998). 
Experimental studies also suggested that the effectiveness of the postural control 
system in maintaining static balance is directly related to the amplitude of COP 
motion, including CoP displacement in anterior-posterior (A/P) and medial-lateral 
(M/L) directions, the speed of CoP sway, and the ellipse area of CoP, are the most 
often used CoP measures to reflect postural stability. Thus, the smallest CoP trajectory 
means the better static balance control ability. The phenomenon is particular true for 
pathologic and aging subjects with dysfunction sensory inputs (Shumway-Cook & 
Woollacott, 1995). 
2.4 Objective and hypotheses 
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short therapy intervention outcome 
to improve the posture control and balance ability of the ADHD through a systematic 
and scientific setup and functional evaluation. This study hypothesized that the 
dynamic rhythm in the figure 8 path of the Hippo-Simulator could improve the 
integrated sensory biofeedback, and resulted in a good posture control ability for the 
ADHD. The data reduction of CoP variables acquired from CTSIB as well as the 
relative Range of Motion (ROM) acquired from Gyro accelerometers were sensitively 
to decimate the efficacy of therapy intervention. 
Chapter 3 Method 
3.1 Participants 
Five healthy children and eleven children with attention deficit-hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) participated in this study. Subjects were recruited either from the 
outpatient clinic of department of Psychiatry, Taipei Veterans General Hospital or 
nearby elementary schools. Participants and their Parents signed the written informed 
consent prior the study.

Hippo-Simulator frequency measurement 
In this study, we first determined which speed of the Hippo-Simulator should we 
choose, thus we use Opal sensors to measure the sway angle and sway frequency 
(time duration) of JOBA EU-6310

Furthermore, we calculated the sway angle of the Hippo-Simulator (Roll: ±5.23˚, 
Pitch: ±4.28 ˚ and Yaw: ±2.01 ˚). Then we compared our results with Pfau (2005) who 
use MT9 (Xsens, Enschede, The Netherlands) gyro-accelerometer to measure the 
sway angles and frequency on Hippo-Simulator of a real horse while in different 
walking speed and discovered that the horse walking speed during slow walk (90~100 
steps per minute, 1.67 Hz), trot (125~130 steps per minute, 2.02 Hz) and canter (150 
steps per minute, 2.57 Hz). Thus we choose speed 9 as our training speed because it 
was most likely to stimulate the real horse while slow walking.

     According to Shumway-Cook & Horak (1986), in this study, a 500 × 500 × 80 
mm (W*L*H) section of medium-density foam was chosen in foam surface tasks in 
order to reduces the accuracy of the orientation information. In firm surface tasks, the 
correct information can offer the body to feel the general ground, but under the foam 
surface tasks, it will reduce and get less exact information that the body feels from the 
foot. Under task three and six, the main purpose of visual conflict dome is to 
interference the vision input. Visual conflict dome is made by a helmet covering with 
calico in the front and both sides with a ‘’X’’ mark inside the calico where subjects 
can see just in front of their eyes. While wearing the visual conflict dome, the dome 
will move together with subject’s head sway (sway referenced vision), thus reduce the 
exactness of visual information that the subject’s receives.(Cohen et al., 1993; 
Richardson et al., 1992; Shumway-Cook & Horak, 1986). Under task two and five, 
subjects were required to close their eyes, in order to deprive visual message input. 
     The main purpose was to observe the patient's attempt to maintain balance in 
standing with feet together hands on hips for thirty seconds under all six tasks. During 
the assessment, subjects were asked to take off their shoes and socks then standing 
barefoot on the RSscan foot pressure plate with feet together, arms hanging by the 
sides and maintain balance for their best in those tasks. Each task performed three 
trials, thirty seconds per trial with sampling rate 30Hz and was performed before and 
after the Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention. Data were collected by footscan

three trials, ten seconds per trial with sampling rate of 30Hz, before and after the 
Hippo-therapy-Simulator Intervention. All data were collected by footscan Balance 
7.97 Second Generation software. 
3.3.2 Dynamic posture control assessment 
     The skin-mounted tri-axial wireless Inertial Measurement sensors were 
placed on subject’s head, neck, L5, back of the Hippo-Simulator and ground as 
reference. The sensor on subject’s neck was adhered to skin with double-sided tape 
and then tightened with surgical plastic tapes (Motex, Taiwan), the sensor on subject’s 
head was adhered using Velcro on a swimming cap then wore by subject, the sensor 
on subject’s L5 was adhered by an elastic band and the sensor on the Hippo-Simulator 
and ground were adhered using Velcro. The Xsensor pressure mapping mat was put 
on the Hippo-Simulator. The main purpose was to observe the patient's range of 
motion of body segments and upper body pressure distribution while maintaining 
balance on the Hippo-Simulator. During the assessment, subjects were asked to take 
off their shoes and socks then sitting on the Hippo-Simulator with speed 9 and look at 
a picture posted straight ahead with arms hanging by the sides in order to reduce 
subject’s head and neck from swaying. Three trials were performed, twenty seconds 
per trial with sampling rate 128 Hz for Opal sensors, 20 Hz for Xsensor pressure 
mapping system. These assessments were performed before and after the 
Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention.

measurement variables were calculated relative to the geometric center of the COP 
trajectory. The CoP measures had frequently been normalized by foot length (FL) in 
the anterior-posterior direction and foot width (FW) in the medial-lateral direction to 
exclude the influence of intersubject variability. Improved static posture control was 
defined as a reduction in postural sway as indicated by decreases in the COP 
measurements (Prieto, 1996).

Results were shown in Table 4.10~4.11. We can observe from the results that the 
standard deviation was relatively larger under CTSIB and SLS tasks for ADHD group 
and in some normal group. We thought the reason were mainly because the level of 
poor posture control abilities for ADHD children were different between subjects. 
Furthermore, some studies showed that normal children’s stance stability may still 
under developing, even at the age of 7~10 years (Cherng, 2003). Thus, the following

4.4.2 Dynamic posture control assessment 
4.4.2.1 Range of motion of body segments on Hippo-Simulator  
After Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention, we can observed from the results of 
the post-assessment that ADHD group still show relatively larger range of motion of 
body segments in L5, neck and head than normal group but the Mann Whitney U test 
showed that these results were no significantly difference. 
4.4.2.2 Upper body pressure distribution on Hippo-Simulator 
    After Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention, we can observed from the results of 
the post-assessment that ADHD group still show relatively larger upper body pressure 
distribution in TRW, MLD, APD and sway area than normal group but the Mann 
Whitney U test showed that these results were no significantly difference. 
4.5 Effects of Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention on static 
posture control assessment 
     All the static posture control assessment data were calculated by 
{(post-assessment - pre-assessment)/ pre-assessment}*100% in order to show the 
increase or decrease percentages of the entire CoP travel way, the maximal CoP 
displacement in Medial-Lateral direction & Anterior-Posterior direction, CoP 
maximal velocity and the Sway area of the CoP trajectory of static posture control 
assessment after thirty minutes Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention. 
4.5.1 Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance (CTSIB) 
4.5.1.1 Entire CoP travel way (TRW) 
     The entire CoP travel way was normalized to the foot width and foot length in 
order to eliminate the variation caused by the foot size.

After thirty minutes Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention, ADHD group show 
decreased entire CoP travel way change in CTSIB 2: -23.51±21.80 % (p=0.021) and 
CTSIB 5: -18.58±23.21 % (p=0.093), normal group show decreased entire CoP travel 
way change in CTSIB 2: -17.07±16.60 % (p=0.285). Results show significantly 
difference for ADHD group under CTSIB task 2. According to the Mann Whitney U 
test, there was no significantly difference between ADHD and normal groups in entire 
CoP travel way change under CTSIB Task 2 & 5.

(MLD) 
The maximal CoP displacement in Medial-Lateral direction was normalized to 
the foot width in order to eliminate the variation caused by the foot size. 
CTSIB Task 1 & 4 
After thirty minutes Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention, both ADHD and 
groups show no changed maximal CoP displacement change in Medial-Lateral 
direction in CTSIB 1 (CTSIB 1: 9.20±41.43 % (p=0.674) (ADHD group); 0.14±13.83 
% (p=0.99) (Normal group)). Under CTSIB Task 4, ADHD group show decreased 
maximal CoP displacement change in Medial-Lateral direction by -18.65±9.63 % 
(p=0.018) and normal group also show decreased by -9.30±2.10 % (p=0.109). Results 
show significantly difference for ADHD group in CTSIB 4. According to the Mann

(p=0.593)), but no significantly difference were observed. Decreased neck sway angle 
change under all 3 directions were observed in both ADHD and normal groups, where 
normal group show larger neck sway angle change than ADHD group except in yaw 
direction. However, the Mann Whitney U test showed that these results were no 
significantly difference (Table 4.39; Figure 4.76~4.78). 
Head 
After thirty minutes Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention, ADHD group show 
decreased head sway angle change across all 3 directions. Results show significantly 
difference in all directions (Roll: -22.38±13.04 %, p=0.001; Pitch: -27.20±18.48 %, 
p=0.001; Yaw: -15.16±12.18 %, p=0.003). Normal group also show decreased head 
sway angle change across all 3 directions and significantly difference in roll direction 
(Roll: -19.58±1.24 %, p=0.002). Decreased head sway angle changes across all 3 
directions were observed in both ADHD and normal groups, where ADHD group 
shows larger head sway angle change than normal group. However, the Mann 
Whitney U test showed that these results were no significantly difference. 
4.6.2 Upper body pressure distribution on Hippo-Simulator 
Under this section, all the upper body pressure distribution data were calculated 
by {(post-assessment - pre-assessment)/ pre-assessment}*100% in order to show the 
increase or decrease percentages of the entire CoP travel way, the maximal CoP 
displacement in Medial-Lateral direction & Anterior-Posterior direction and the Sway 
area of the CoP trajectory of upper body pressure distribution after thirty minutes 
Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention. 
4.6.2.1 Entire CoP travel way (TRW) 
After thirty minutes Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention, both ADHD and 
normal groups show decreased entire CoP travel way change of upper body pressure 
distribution (TRW: -18.89±5.24 % (p=0.003) (ADHD group); -16.89±7.56 % 
(p=0.109) (Normal group)). Results show significantly difference for ADHD groups, 
where ADHD group shows larger decreased entire CoP travel way change of upper 
body pressure distribution than the normal group. However, the Mann Whitney U test 
showed that these results were no significantly difference.

difference in CTSIB task 4 (MLD, APD, MaxVel & Sway Area), CTSIB task 5 (Sway 
Area), CTSIB task 6 (TRW & MaxVel), SLS task 1 (TRW, APD, MaxVel, Sway Area), 
SLS task 2 (TRW, APD & Sway Area), SLS task 3 (MLD & MaxVel) and SLS task 4 
(MLD & MaxVel). From this result we can explain why there were no significantly 
difference in Pre-assessment and Post-assessment between ADHD and Normal 
Groups, because the improvement after thirty minutes Hippo-therapy-Simulator 
intervention for static posture control ability were differ between ADHD subjects. We 
can also observed from the literature review that ADHD children do have posture 
control dysfunction but there still don’t have a proper way to evaluate the level of 
posture control dysfunction for ADHD children.  
5.2 Sensory ratio analysis 
     From Pre-Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention, the results show relatively 
lower somatosensory and visual scores in ADHD group than in normal group. 
Although the results were not significantly difference, it may indicate that ADHD 
group had poor somatosensory and visual inputs than the normal group. 
Interestingly, relatively lower vestibular and preference scores were found in both 
ADHD and normal groups. The lower preference score means that both groups rely 
on visual cues even when they were inaccurate and the lower vestibular score 
indicated that vestibular input in both groups may still under development. 
5.3 Time duration of Single-Leg Stance 
     After Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention, we can observe from the results 
that both group show improvement in time duration of Single-Leg stance under all 
four tasks. Although the results were not significantly difference, it may still show 
that both ADHD and normal groups improved in dynamic posture control ability after 
Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention. 
 
5.4 Effects of Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention on static 
posture control assessment 
5.4.1 Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance (CTSIB) 
     Balance control is an important sensory motor function that may be damaged 
for the ADHD population because it requires the ability to integrate inputs from 
various sensory systems (ie, somatosensory, visual, vestibular) and to utilize the 
integrated sensory signals in generating coordinated motor actions to maintain body

neck (-15.31 % in roll, -15.50 % in pitch and -13.06 % in yaw directions) and head 
(-22.38 % in roll, -27.20 % in pitch and -15.16 % in yaw directions), all the data in 
neck and head reach significantly difference (Figure 5.1~5.4). Interestingly, L5 sway 
angle of ADHD group had shown increased by 34.71 % in roll, 19.50 % in pitch and 
25.00 % in yaw directions and both roll and yaw directions reach significantly 
difference. 
After Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention the range of motion of body 
segments for ADHD group had decreased in neck and head, and increased in L5, both 
results show improved dynamic posture control ability for ADHD group. However, 
normal group also show the same trend as ADHD group after 
Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention but less significant, that was because the 
normal children already had a good dynamic posture control ability and the 
Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention in this study only last for 30 minutes, thus we 
can observe the trend to improve dynamic posture control ability but not significant. 
5.5.2 Upper body pressure distribution on Hippo-Simulator 
According to the results from this study, after Hippo-therapy-Simulator 
intervention the upper body pressure distribution of ADHD group had decreased in 
entire CoP travel way (-18.89 %), maximal CoP displacement in Anterior-Posterior 
direction (-18.77 %) and sway area of the CoP trajectory (-35.12 %). All of them 
reached significantly difference. Interestingly, the maximal CoP displacement in 
Medial-Lateral direction of ADHD group show increased by 31.35 % and reach 
significantly difference. However, normal group also decreased in entire CoP travel 
way (-16.89 %), maximal CoP displacement in Anterior-Posterior direction (-27.47 %) 
and sway area of the CoP trajectory (-44.86 %) and increased in maximal CoP 
displacement in Medial-Lateral direction (18.70 %) after Hippo-therapy-Simulator 
intervention, but only the maximal CoP displacement in Anterior-Posterior direction 
reached significantly difference. 
     Mao (2006) recruited one female subject (Age: 9.67; Height: 124 cm; Weight: 
28.4 kg) for the therapeutic horseback riding course (JOBA EU-6441, Speed 1.29 Hz, 
30 minutes per time, 3 times per week, last for 12 weeks). The ADHD children did 
not taking medicine during the assessment. Results showed that CoM largest 
difference in Medial-Lateral direction increased by 192.22 % and CoM largest 
difference in Anterior-Posterior direction decreased by -63.16 %, but Mao did not 
explain what cause increased CoM largest difference in Medial-Lateral direction. 
Compared with our results, ADHD group show increased maximal CoP displacement 
in Medial-Lateral direction by 31.35 % and decreased maximal CoP displacement in 
Anterior-Posterior direction by -18.77 %. Both results show very similar trend in 
                                                 
46 
 
in dynamic posture control ability while riding on the Hippo-Simulator (average 
improvement of range of motion in head by 20 %; neck by 14 %; L5 by 20 % and 
upper body balance control by 18 %). Also from upper body pressure distribution we 
can see improvement in both Anterior-Posterior (-19%) and Medial-Lateral directions 
(31%). Furthermore, from CTSIB and Single-Leg stance assessment, we can observe 
improvement in static posture control ability. These results reveal that 
Hippo-therapy-Simulator intervention was effectively in improving both static and 
dynamic posture control abilities for ADHD children and can be generalized as home 
rehabilitation device.

一、 目的 
    前往美國鹽湖城參加為期兩天半的 2012 年美國術中監測年會(American Society of 
Neurophysiological Monitoring)，並進行口頭論文報告” Ultrasound guidance for 
localization of neck and trunk muscles during intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring” 
 
二、 過程 
    職於 5 月 3 日傍晚搭機離開台灣，並於 5 月 4 日凌晨 2 點才抵達美國鹽湖城(因
飛機嚴重誤點)，稍事休息後，當天早上 7 點開始參加為期兩天半的會議。為期兩天
半的會議期間，早上 6:45 到 7:30am 大會安排了 breakfast with the Experts，分別有在各
領域的專家跟學員分享臨床經驗，並可隨時發問及討論，獲益良多。5 月 4 日上午的
上課主題是 Evidence-based medicine，討論近來及未來與術中監測相關的研究走向；5
月 4 日下午的上課主題是 Cranial nerve & PN IONM reserch，主講者鉅細靡遺的分享寶
貴的臨床資訊及經驗；5 月 5 日上午的上課主題是 Spine IONM research，探討脊椎手
術相關的術中監測方法；5 月 5 日下午的上課主題是 Brain IONM research，同樣的聽
眾都感到耳目一新。最後一天上午則是安排 IONM team compete interactive session。另
外前面兩天在 5:15 到 6:45pm 則有 Abstracts presentation，課程安排可說是非常實用及
充實。我的口頭論文報告安排在 5 月 5 日下午，報告時間 10 分鐘，討論 5 分鐘，我
報告的主題是” Ultrasound guidance for localization of neck and trunk muscles during 
intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring”， 詳細報告近半年來我們使用超音波在術
中監測的臨床應用，內容得到與會者很大的迴響，主持人表示我們的報告解答了他
們長期以來在監測肋間肌(intercostal muscle)時遇到的困擾，因為事實上在我們之前從
事術中監測者從未使用超音波協助進行術中監測。因此受到很大的鼓勵，所以回來
後馬上寫成文章，向 Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 投稿，目前正在審查中。

Localization of intercostal muscles and cricothyroid muscle under 
ultrasound guidance during intraoperative monitoring 
When doing pedicle screw stimulation for T2-6 levels, needle electrode needs to be 
placed at relevant Intercostal muscles so as to record compound muscle action potential 
(CMAP). When mapping the 10
th
 cranial nerve during surgery of skull base tumor, 
cricothyroid muscle can be used to record CMAP as well. Both of the intercostals muscle 
and cricothyroid muscle are not superficially located and do carry certain risk if needles are 
inserted too deep, which will associate with increased morbidity related to intraoperative 
monitoring (IOM) itself. We use musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US) successfully to 
visualize and locate these two muscles during preparation of IOM. B-mode of US scan 
with high frequency transducer of at least 10 MHz is used for better signal resolution and 
subdermal EEG needle used for CMAP recording. We insert recording needles either under 
direst ultrasound guidance or indirectly guided by pre-collected data including the precise 
puncture site of needle and preferred depth of needle tip within safety margin. Clinical use 
of US during IOM is simple, non-invasive, and available in most of the operation room. It 
provides valuable information to monitorist when dealing with intercostal and cricothyroid 
muscles and will certainly increase accuracy of monitoring and safety of surgical 
procedures as well.
