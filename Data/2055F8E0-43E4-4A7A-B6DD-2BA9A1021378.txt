Although surgery is still the most frequently used treatment for cancer, radiation 
therapy plays an important role for some specific tumors. Though radioactive rays 
will also affect the surrounding normal tissues, fortunately, most normal tissues are 
not much affected by radioactive rays. Moreover, the ability of normal tissues to 
reconstruct themselves is better. Therefore, using the radioactive ray carefully and 
avoiding irradiation of normal tissues will achieve elimination of cancer cells without 
producing too many side effects. 
    Radiation therapy can be divided into two main types, namely ‘brachytherapy’ 
and ‘teletherapy’. Brachytherapy is a treatment with radioactive rays close to the 
tumor. Teletherapy is also called external radiation therapy. Contrast to brachytherapy, 
teletherapy can irradiate larger areas and is suitable for general cancers. Cobalt 60 or 
linear accelerator is employed to produce radioactive high-energy rays. In recent years, 
there has been a new development in radiation therapy, the intensity modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT). 
    IMRT is an advanced mode of high-precision radiotherapy that utilizes 
computer-controlled X-ray accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to a 
malignant tumor or specific areas within the tumor. The radiation dose is designed to 
conform to the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of the tumor by modulating or 
controlling the intensity of the radiation beam to focus a higher radiation dose on the 
tumor while minimizing the exposure of surrounding normal tissues to radiation. 
Treatment is carefully planned using 3-D computed tomography (CT) images of the 
patient in conjunction with computerized dose calculations to determine the dose 
intensity pattern that will best conform to the tumor shape. Typically, combinations of 
several intensity-modulated fields coming from different beam directions produce a 
custom tailored radiation dose that maximizes tumor dose while also protecting 
adjacent normal tissues. Because the ratio of normal tissue dose to tumor dose is 
reduced to a minimum with the IMRT approach, higher and more effective radiation 
doses can be delivered safely to tumors with fewer side effects compared with 
conventional radiotherapy techniques. Currently, IMRT is being employed to treat 
cancers of the prostate, head and neck, breast, thyroid and lung, as well as in 
gynecologic, liver and brain tumors and lymphomas and sarcomas. IMRT is also 
beneficial for treating pediatric malignancies. 
    The goal of radiotherapy is to deliver a required radiation dose to the planning 
target volume (PTV) while minimizing the doses to adjacent organs at risk (OAR) and 
other normal tissues. A beam is more preferable if it can deliver more radiation doses 
to the target without exceeding the dose tolerance of the OARs or normal tissues 
located on the path of the beam. In spite of the advancement of technique in 
radiotherapy, there are many restrictions in optimization of radiotherapy planning, 
 4
exceeding the tolerance of the OARs and the generic normal tissues located on the 
path of the beamlet. Then they utilized the prescribed dose to normalize the mean 
square target dose and evaluated the score of the chosen beam orientation. 
Schreibmann and Xing [40] considered the concept of empirical score function and 
equivalent uniform dose (EUD) at the same time to deal with selection of beam 
orientation ranking by the Lagrange function. Niemierko [30] proposed an EUD 
function, which translates a heterogeneous dose distribution on a structure into a 
single value representing the uniform dose that would have the same biological effect. 
Therefore, a virtue of the EUD-based approach is that the volumetric status of an 
organ can be characterized by a single parameter instead of two (dose and volume), 
making the incorporation of dose-volume effect in the single beam ranking more 
tractable. The advantage of the pBEV technique is that it helps to distinguish “good” 
or “bad” directions. That is to say, it is a “bad” beam orientation if the beam has a low 
pBEV score. However, the pBEV technique is restricted in finding the optimal beam 
configuration in an IMRT planning because the score does not consider the interplay 
among multiple beams. 
    Pugachev and Xing [34] considered using a Beam’s-eye view dosimetrics 
(BEVD) technique to assist in selecting the beam orientations in IMRT. The principle 
of the BEVD technique is similar to the pBEV approach. BEVD ranks a beam 
direction by the empirical score function, which is the same as the pBEV score 
function and the BEVD score is obtained under the assumption of a single incident 
beam. The main difference between pBEV and BEVD is the objective function. In 
order to illustrate the effectiveness of the BEVD tool, they used a quadratic 
dose-based objective function for optimizing the beam profile, and then optimized the 
beam configuration by simulated annealing. The application of the BEVD technique 
would make the search process of beam configurations more intelligent and efficient, 
thus saving a large amount of computing time. Again, the BEVD technique does not 
guarantee optimal beam configuration because of the absence of beam interplay. 
    Rowbottom et al. [37] presented the beam orientation constrained customization 
(BOCC) scheme for selecting appropriate beam configuration. In BOCC scheme, they 
utilized a single-beam cost function that points out the ‘good’ beam orientation 
regions for single beams first. After obtaining the cost of a beam orientation by the 
single-beam cost function, the multibeam cost function of the BOCC scheme was 
evaluated for multiple treatment beams and then they determined the beam 
configuration by a fast simulated annealing (FSA) algorithm. The objective of the 
multibeam cost function to be minimized is a composite function of the standard 
deviation of the mean dose to the PTV and the highest single-beam cost for multiple 
treatment beams.

decided by physicians. First, physicians utilize CT slices to determine the PTV and 
OARs and depict the boundaries of the tumor and organs according to the patient’s 
condition. Then they decide the prescription and the number of treatment episodes for 
the patients taking into consideration the side effects. After obtaining the patient’s 
information, they start to select the beam configuration and the corresponding medical 
facilities required for IMRT. 
    The main factors affecting the choice of beam orientations include the dose 
description in tumor and the dose constraints of OARs. Because the dose description 
is manually determined, it involves some variations. Different physicians might 
determine dissimilar dose description and a physician may plan different dose 
descriptions at different times. There are also some variations in the boundaries of the 
PTV and OARs. However, the difference is relatively slight and thus could be ignored. 
With respect to the dose constraints for each organ, there exists a criterion, which was 
modified from the Radiation Biology and Radiation Pathology Syllabus by the 
American College of Radiology [19]. Physicians consult the criterion for determining 
the doses limited to OARs. 
    Radiation therapy cannot be completed at one time for the consideration of the 
reconstruction of normal tissues. In other words, radiation therapy is a long-term 
process and is composed of multiple dose fractionation schemes. Usually the specific 
radiation dose will be received every time, one or twice a day and five days per week 
in clinical setting, until the radiation dose received equals the dose prescribed. Neither 
the overall radiation therapy nor the fractionation radiation therapy would affect the 
selection of beam orientations. For example, a physician determines that the dose 
description is 2000 Gy and the number of treatment episodes is 10, according to the 
patient’s condition. Therefore, the fractionation dose description is 200 Gy and the 
selection of the final beam configuration is the same for each fractionation treatment. 
Physicians usually do not use a single beam for irradiation and the number of beams 
selected is assigned empirically. Because multiple beams are selected, the interplay 
among them should be considered during the planning process. One beam orientation 
that was appropriate for an organ might not be suitable for another organ, so the 
planner needs to assign the important factors for each organ and considers the tradeoff 
among OARs to select the optimal beam configuration. 
    Dose-volume histogram (DVH) is a curve that represents the relationship 
between the radiation doses received and volumes for OARs or PTV. DVH is an 
important factor that is considered for the selection of beam orientations in IMRT [17, 
43]. For example, the point P reveals that the volume receiving radiation doses higher 
than 34Gy is 40% of the total volume as shown in Fig. 2.1. If the curve of DVH for 
OAR is lower, then the volume receiving the same radiation doses is smaller. On the

non-linear programming (MINLP). In order to make this problem easier to solve, we 
transform the MINLP problem into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) 
problem according to the idea proposed by Yang et al. [51].

meets the original restrictions and ranges between 0 and WL. Similarly, when ib  is 
zero, the value of product i ipb w⋅  in equations (7), (10) and (17) is zero; otherwise, 
the value of the product i ipb w⋅  is ipw . Therefore, ipw  can replace the product

    In order to verify the results of the proposed MILP model, we further adopt the 
equi-spaced beam model with the same dose prescriptions, constraints and penalty 
factors of OARs. For the equi-spaced beam model, the beam orientations were set to 
be equi-spaced, while the beam intensity maps were obtained by solving the LP model. 
We compared the proposed MILP model with the same number of equi-spaced beams 
in terms of target coverage and critical structures spared. 
    We performed several numerical analyses for different prostate cases. Only one 
of the cases was presented here in detail. Numerical analyses with the random 
generated constraint points in the same prostate case were implemented and the 
number of test problems was set to be 10. The number of constraint points was 
assigned to be 50. The results of the objective function values and dose distribution of

CONTROL 
3.1 Introduction 
    In order to reduce the death rate and to increase the years of living, the 
government or decision-makers should establish an effective health care system to 
control all the diseases well, especially prevailing diseases. Undoubtedly, it is more 
important to put more notice on the spread of infectious disease than that of other 
diseases. Infectious diseases can cause death directly. They can also cause death 
indirectly by increasing the chance that an individual will contract other diseases such 
as cancer. More terrible is that the death caused by the infectious disease is much 
more than that caused by the war. According to the data collected, the death rate due 
to the epidemics in 2002 around the world is almost 26% while the rate of the war is 
only 0.3% [6]. Competing epidemic control programs may include vaccination, and 
prevention programs. Prevention programs include programs for ensuring the safety 
of the health system, reducing the spread of an infectious disease by reducing the 
infectiousness of infected individuals, such as quarantine system, and increasing the 
removal rate by changing the patient’s habit of taking medicine or the progress in the 
cure of medicine. The quarantine system and vaccination can have influence on 
controlling the spread of infectious disease by investment. How can decision-makers 
best choose among competing epidemic control programs and vaccination? 
    If resources are unlimited, then the optimal way to allocate funds is to spend 
enough money to reduce the transmission rate to its lowest level, to increase the 
vaccination rate to its highest level, and to increase the removal rate. However, when 
the resources are limited, the solution is no longer obvious. It is necessary to 
investigate how to allocate limited resources to minimize the growth of an epidemic. 
A variety of Operation Research method have been applied to the problem of resource 
allocation for epidemic control, including standard cost-effectiveness analysis [12], 
linear and integer programming, simulation, optimal control methodologies [41]. In 
this study, we construct an epidemic model to describe the infectious disease and use 
the OR-based method (non-linear programming) to cope with the optimization 
problem under limited budget. 
    According to report of WHO, it was estimated that nearly 1/3 of the people were 
infected with the TB in the whole world in 2000, more than 8 million of people were 
new discovery cases, and 2 million were dead. The cases of bacteria of the multiple 
resistances to the action of a drug increase year by year, the urgent state of TB has not 
been seen improving [49]. In 1993, WHO declared the rising incidence of TB a global 
public health emergency. Since then, the disease has advanced, now causing an 
estimated 2 million deaths annually. In 2006, WHO also announced the cause of TB 
 20
Associated with each intervention is a “production function’ that relates the amount 
invested in the intervention to values of parameters in the epidemic model. 
 
3.2.3 Optimization Models 
    Some authors [22, 41, 52, 53] have develop optimization models to describe the 
resource allocation problem. The model has different interventions (prevention 
programs and vaccination) to control the disease. Each prevention program may have 
an upper limit. There are some kinds of objectives usually used for epidemic control. 
We will discuss below: 
1. Let ( )QALY ν  denote the number of quality-adjusted life years gained over the 
time horizon of the problem given the interventions, ν . The objective function is 
to maximize the QALYs gained. 
2. Minimize the risk of infection of the infected persons (open-case) (ARI) over the 
time horizon of the problem given the interventions, ν . 
The ARI indicates the proportion of the population that will be infected or 
re-infected with TB during one year. The ARI links the uninfected and the 
smear-positive cases, hence it depends on the number of open cases presented at 
any time. 
    These functions are determined from the epidemic model and describe how 
parameters of the epidemic model change in the prevention interventions. 
Unfortunately, the epidemic model might not have a closed form. Given a short time 
period, if each fraction of the epidemic model can not be expressed as a closed form, 
an approximation method will be developed. When the considered time horizon is 
short enough, we can approximate each compartment size function with a Taylor 
series polynomial expanded around t = 0 [52]. This is possible because we found that 
the epidemic model can be represented by a system of differential equations, and 
assumed that compartment size at time zero are known. In addition, Zaric and 
Brandeau [52] proofed that the error of using a second-order approximation method is 
less than 5%. 
 
3.3 Model Construction 
3.3.1 Problem Statement 
    TB is primarily an illness of the respiratory system, and can be spread by 
coughing and sneezing. Each year about 1.7 million people die from this curable 
disease in the world [49]. It is a contagious disease. Like the common cold, it spreads 
through the air. Only people who are sick with TB in their lungs are infectious. When 
infectious people cough, sneeze, talk or spit, they propel TB germs, known as bacilli, 
into the air. A person who is lack of immunization needs only to inhale a small 
 22
4. If someone who is a chronic TB patient and does not take medicine regularly 
repeatedly, the person turns to infection (drug-resistance) compartment and is very 
difficult to cure. 
 
3.3.2 Model Framework 
    A mathematical model is essential for the analysis of TB. The model depicts the 
dynamic relations of the stages of the disease and demonstrates how the system 
responds to the application of various forms of control. Revelle et al. [35] had 
considered an epidemic model used for TB and considering the inactive case and 
active case. Besides Garcia et al. [20] proposed the most detailed model used for TB, 
and describing the symptom of the whole TB disease period. However, the model we 
constructed also compartmentalizes the patients of TB by the seriousness of the 
disease, the infection (drug-resistance) part. 
 
3.3.2.1 State Description 
    The epidemic model of TB we described consists of the following parts: 
1. The susceptibles compartment: The individuals in the susceptible compartment are 
inclined to be infected with TB. The individuals will transfer from susceptible 
compartment to the vaccinated compartment by vaccinating, and transfer from 
vaccinated compartment to the susceptible compartment because of losing 
immunity. All the newborns are assumed susceptible. 
2. The vaccinated compartment: The individuals in the vaccinated compartment are 
prevented from suffering the TB disease because of vaccination. The individuals 
will transfer from susceptibles to vaccinated compartment by vaccinating and leave 
for susceptibles because for losing immunity. 
3. The latent Infection compartment: The individuals in this compartment are those 
who once infected with TB, but do not immediately infect others. The individual 
will enter this compartment from susceptibles because of infected, and leave for 
infection (open case) compartment due to being infectious. 
4. The infection (open case) compartment: The individuals in this compartment are 
active TB patients and infectious. With early detection and proper treatment, they 
can transfer to non-infectious TB patients.       
5. The infection (non-open case) compartment: The individuals in this compartment 
are TB patients who are not infectious and will be cured easily by regularly taking 
medicine or become chronic patients.  
6. The chronic compartment: The individuals in this compartment are chronic TB 
patients and do not infect to others. But they may relapse to TB patient (open case) 
or TB patient (non-open case) with higher probability. Also, the individuals will 
 24
individuals in chronic compartment with proportionality 6k . 
8. If people in the chronic compartment do not take medicine regularly, the therapy 
would exert tolerance and it is difficult to cure. The number of people from chronic 
compartment turning to infection (drug-resistance) compartment at a rate 
proportion to the number of individuals in chronic compartment with 
proportionality 7 5( )k ν , given the investment 5ν . 
9. The contact rate λ , is the average number of susceptible infected per year of an 
infective person. People would be infected from susceptible compartment at a rate 
proportional to the number of susceptibles and infectious patients with 
proportionality constant 3( )λ ν , given the investment 3ν . 
 
3.3.2.3 Tuberculosis Control Interventions 
    There are several ways to control the spread of TB. In this study we propose the 
following methods to control the disease. The interventions to stop TB Strategy are 
[50]: 
1. Prevention method： 
(1) Improving the vaccination system.：  The government can invest 1v  in 
vaccineeetion system, where the vaccination rate is 1( )vθ .  
(2) Reduce the contact rate：If the government can take the effective ways to reduce 
the contact rate, like quarantine system, and invest 3v  in the health system to 
reduce the TB contact rate, where the detection rate is 3( )vλ . 
(3) Increasing the detection rate：The government can invest 2v  in the health system 
to improve the detection and to treat TB patient, where the detection rate is 3 2( )k v . 
2. Treatment method： 
(1) Pursuing high-quality Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) 
expansion and enhancement. 
DOTS is a strategy which WHO made to stop the TB. The key idea of DOTS is 
that every TB patient should take medicine regularly under monitoring. The 
basic components of DOTS are [50]: 
‧ Political commitment with increased and sustained financing 
‧ Standardized treatment, with supervision and patient support 
‧ An effective drug supply and management system 
The primary effect of DOTS strategy we consider is to reduce the rate of moving 
to infection (drug-resistance) from chronic case. We can formulate a production 
function when the government invest 5ν  in DOTS, where the rate of moving to 
infection (drug-resistance) from chronic case is 7 5( )k ν . 
(2) Increase the cure rate：With the progress of the medical treatment, the cure rate of 
TB disease may be improved. The government can invest 4v  in the health system 
 26
where 0 0 0 03 5 7, , , ,k k k θ  and 0λ  represent the rate under no investment for the five 
interventions respectively, and ib  represents the proportional rate between 
investment and program outcome. 
 
3.3.2.4 Epidemic Model and Equations 
    Here we use the network flow representation of the epidemic model proposed by 
Zaric and Brandeau [52] and the special feature of TB disease to construct the TB 
epidemic model with interventions. The graph of the proposed TB epidemic model is 
shown as in Fig 3.1, and the differentiated equations are as follows:

2. Each compartment at time zero is known because the TB disease status quo is 
known. 
3. In this study, we want to know which intervention is more important and effective 
in each TB disease, so we assume that the utility of each intervention is equal. One 
unit of budget input can result in the parameter as the change rate of 0.001.That is, 
ib  is 0.001 in this study. 
4. We do not consider the transmission between populations. We only consider one 
closed population. 
5. All people can be described by one of the compartments. 
 
3.3.3 Resource Allocation Problem 
    Next, we will deal with the optimal resource allocation problem in a short time 
when facing different situations of tuberculosis disease (different area or health care 
system). The relationship among the TB disease, interventions and the objective can 
be shown as in Fig. 3.2. We assume that the TB disease is modeled by an epidemic 
model, and the interventions change one or more of the parameters that describe the 
epidemic. Each TB disease case (TB disease in one health care system) can be 
described as a set of numbers which include the current condition 
( (0,0), (0,0), (0,0), (0,0)OS V LI I , (0,0), (0,0)NOI H  , (0,0), (0,0)DRC I ) and flow parameters 
( 0 0 0 0 01 2 3 4 5 6 7, , , , , , , ,k k k k k k kθ λ ).The flow parameters can divide into two segments: 
controllable parameters and incontrollable parameters. Incontrollable parameters are 
the nature of TB disease and are all the same different cases. However, the 
controllable parameters vary from region to region subject to the budget and the 
strategy of different health care systems. 
    Every TB disease at present can be represented by one current state (the 
important segment of the epidemic model). However, there is no available current 
condition of the disease in each case, we have to estimate it from the past flow 
parameters. As our model is mostly linear, it reaches a state of stable evolution, i.e. 
stable flows, stable groups proportions. Although the time taken to reach this stable 
evolution is indeed dependent on the choice of current values, the stable state depends 
only on the values of flow parameters. In order to analyze and simplify this kind of 
question, we assume that every tuberculosis situation at present is the long-term 
equilibrium of all prevented and controlled methods used to decrease the number of 
TB patients before. 
    The object of this paper is to find the effectively allocating resources method to 
minimize the number of infectious persons in a short time. The resource allocation 
problem can be written as: 
 30
1. Taylor series polynomial expanded 
    When we want to estimate the infectious patients at the time t = 5, Taylor series 
polynomial approximation can provide less error if the expanded point we chose of 
Taylor series is near to 5. But when the expanded point we chose is larger than 2, 
Taylor series polynomial is too complicated for us to formulate because we only knew 
the current condition at time t = 0, so we approximate the infection size function with 
a Taylor series polynomial expanded around t = 1. This can be solved because we 
assume that the epidemic is modeled by a system of differential equations, and we 
assumed that each size at time zero is known. Besides, in each case we formulate and 
test the coefficient of Taylor series polynomial in order that Taylor series polynomial 
approximation we proposed can provide less error than the original one. 
    In this study, we used Taylor series polynomial expanded at t =1 with second 
order relationship. We can formulate our approximation by the following steps: 
(1) Construct the equation which the relation between percentage of infectious 
patients and time is second-order relationship.

2. Regression Model 
    We use the adding 3 center points to the 2k  factorial design. After deciding the 
important factors, we fit a linear regression model 
(1) Choose k as the number of the controllable parameters. In our model, the number 
of the controllable parameters is 5. Construct a 2k  factorial design adding 3 
center points and fit a linear regression model. 
(2) Use the regression model to estimate the objective function 
 
3.4 Conclusions 
    According to the controllable flow parameters are described in Garcia [20], 
others (µ ,λ ) are collected by Centers for Disease Control, R.O.C [3]. The value of 
each parameter can be found. Comparing the result of the two different 
approximations above, we can find the better objective value and portfolio as shown

4. COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS IN END STAGE RENAL DISEASE 
TREATMENT 
4.1 Introduction 
    Three major treatment modalities for patients with end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) have been well known in Taiwan. Haemodialysis (HD), the cleaning of blood 
from waste products through an artificial kidney, was introduced in 1960. Kidney 
transplantation with non-related donor organs has been possible since 1962 and 
eliminates the necessity of dialysis as long as the graft is not irreversibly rejected by 
the recipient. Peritoneal dialysis (PD), the removal of waste products through a 
cleaning fluid in the abdominal cavity, became clinically available in the late 1970s. 
    Many publications such as [28, 44] have considered the cost-effectiveness of 
ESRD treatment. They use Markov-chain model to study the influence of substitutive 
policies on the overall cost-effectiveness of the ESRD treatment program. Most 
studies [15, 28] that have considered two or more treatment options for ESRD patients 
described a hierarchy in the cost-effectiveness of treatments. Kidney transplantation is 
described as having the best ration between costs and effects of treatment, followed 
by either HD or PD. 
    Consequently, the goal of this thesis is to present a Markov model which is used 
to describe the progression of ESRD patients to analysis the cost-effectiveness of the 
two treatments, and to propose a mathematical model to allocate the limited funds for 
ESRD patients to achieve their best QALYs and to make the whole benefits optimal. 
The objective of this model is to maximize the effects of investing on the 
popularization programs to meet the government’s ideal level of efficiently allocating 
patients under the two treatments. 
 
4.2 Literature Review 
4.2.1 Kidney Allocation model 
    Approximately 45% of all organs are refused by the first-offered candidate 
though the shortage of acute organ [54]. These refusals are typically made by the 
transplant surgeons and they reflect their own experience and beliefs about the type of 
organs best suited to their patients. David and Yechiali [16] present a stylized model 
that captures such decision making. The authors solve the optimal stopping time 
problem under a variety of assumptions and they obtain insightful expressions. 
Furthermore, Ann and Hornberger [7] extended this basic model to improve its 
clinical relevance. An important novelty of their model is that it considers explicitly 
the utility of the patient in each state, commonly referred to as the patient’s 
quality-of-life score. Their results show that a patient’s decision threshold changes 
with the patient’s perception about quality of life in different health state. 
 34
regard to health decision making and the type of decisions he or she was involved in. 
Then seven formal optimality criteria and six budgetary constraints were presented. In 
these formulas we choose the one suited for our model in next chapter. 
    Furthermore, Epstein and Chalabi [18] aim to show, using a policy-relevant 
example, how mathematical programming (MP) can be used as a generalization of the 
standard decision rules. The objective is to determine the optimal values of the 
available healthcare treatments so as to maximize the gross benefit subject to an 
overall budgetary constraint. 
 
4.3 Model Construction 
4.3.1 Problem Statement 
    More than 5,000 persons per year in Taiwan develop insufficiency of kidney 
function to such an extent that they are unable to remove fluid, electrolytes, and 
biologic waste products [2]. Without treatments, these patients would die within 
weeks to months from any number of complications, including excessive 
accumulation of fluid in the lungs, arrest of the normal heart rhythm, seizures, or 
coma. The primary forms of treatment for removing potentially toxic biologic waste 
products are HD (dialysis through direct cleansing of the blood), PD (dialysis through 
the small vessels surrounding the gut), and kidney transplantation. Each of these 
options is imperfect solutions to ESRD. Dialysis is a significant inconvenience to 
most patients because of the extensive time needed for treatments－at least 9 to 12 
hours per week. Further, patients treated with dialysis on average experience a 
significantly lower level of function or quality of life than persons without ESRD. 
    Physicians are required by law to inform each patient at the beginning of ESRD 
of the three treatment options for ESRD. Because of the poor availability of donor 
kidneys, more than 90% of patients begin one of the two dialysis options. At present, 
most dialysis patients in Taiwan use the HD approach, while PD is used in extremely 
rare cases. Nevertheless, we want to know whether the current circumstance of patient 
distribution between the two treatments optimal. Later, we will discuss the 
cost-effectiveness analysis of the two dialysis options and construct the optimal 
budget allocation model of ESRD patients. 
 
4.3.2 Methodology 
    This study constructed the cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective 
by using the Markov model. The transition probabilities and the characteristics of the 
disease natural history of ESRD are collected from the database of Department of 
Health and the BNHI. The tool used in this research is the Decision Analysis Tree Age 
(DATA) 7.0, the health care decision analysis software, to construct the decision tree 
 36
transition probabilities. The transition probabilities account for disease progression 
over time, which incorporates both the natural disease progression as well as any 
impact of the selected treatments on slowing disease progression. As a patient passes 
through each state, costs and quality of life values are added. 
 
 
Fig. 4.1 Schematic for Markov model of ESRD 
 
4.3.4 Model Framework for Budget Allocation 
    A mathematical model is essential for the analysis of ESRD. The model depicts 
the transition between the stages of the disease and demonstrates how the system 
responds to the changes of transition rates under various popularization methods. All 
individuals will exit from each category because of death except the recovery state. 
We assumed the patient may experience one of the above six health states every three 
months. We modeled transition rates within three months among these health states as 
a Markov chain (see Fig. 4.1). We used quarterly transition rates, instead of monthly 
transition rates, because the available data are not sufficiently precise to calculate 
monthly transition. 
    There are some methods to popularize the using of PD treatment [5]. In this 
thesis, we propose the following three strategies to increase the using of PD treatment. 
The proposed popularization methods are: 
1. Increase the benefits paid of PD treatment by National Health Insurance 
 38
from PD to PD, given the investment y . The strategy that inspires new ESRD patients 
to take the PD treatments can increase the transition rate ( )zµ  of new patients on PD 
treatment, given the investment z . After the changes of the three transition 
rates ,   and θ λ µ  under investments ,  and x y z for S  cycles. The number of patients 
after S  cycles ( , , )Sin θ λ µ  will change with the transition matrix. For each patient in 
state i , they are assigned different iqaly  that measures the quality of life they gain 
through the cycle times. Furthermore, different iCost  indicates the cost needed in 
each treatment. In order to increase the patients from HD to PD, the BNHI budgets a 
fixed amount of money B to get the goal. The three kinds of investments ,   and x y z  
are limited within the convert budgets b and are included in the total available 
budget B . In addition, ( , , )c θ λ µ  indicates the convert cost that changes the 
transition rate ,  ,  and θ λ µ . In fact, it is the sum of ,   and x y z  and will be less than 
or equal to the convert budget b. 
    The notations and decision variables presented in the model are shown as bellow:

4.4 Model Analysis 
4.4.1 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) 
    The subjects being investigated are the ESRD patients. In the beginning of the 
model, we assume that all patients are in the state of health state. Cost effectiveness 
was calculated as the average cost per patient treated successfully. This was done by 
dividing the total cost and patients successfully treated. The collected data are 
analyzed by the TreeAge software, and the cost effectiveness ratio of two treatments 
PD and HD are calculated. In the simulation, one cycle represents three months. 
Hence, the collected data and the parameters are set in three months. 
 
4.4.1.1 Parameters setting 
    In order to analyze cost-effectiveness of the two treatments, some input 
parameters are needed in the Markov model. They include transition probabilities, 
health state utilities, and cost, etc. These data came from data of the BNHI and the 
published literature [7]. 
    Fig. 4.2 shows the CEA of the 12 cycles. The top left dot indicates the 
cost-effectiveness ratio of the HD treatment while the downright dot indicates that of 
the PD treatment. The x-axis represents “effectiveness” and the y-axis 
represents”cost”. According to the figure, we can conclude that PD is more 
cost-effectiveness than HD for the more effectiveness and less cost of PD.

value is set to be between 0.0005~0.003, the detail results of CEA including the coasts, 
incremental costs, effects, incremental effects, C/E, and incremental C/E of the two 
treatments are shown as in Table 4.3: 
    To show the results more clearly, the variation of pHD_PD and C/E of the two 
treatments are shown as in Fig. 4.4: 
    From the C/E results changed by pHD_PD, it shows that no matter how 
pHD_PD changes, PD is the treatment that is more cost-effectiveness. In addition, as 
the transition probability from HD to PD is higher, C/E ratio of HD and PD is lower. 
 44
transferring patients to PD can be increased, i.e., the proportions of patients numbers 
who accept PD treatments is increasing, the cost-effectiveness ratio would be better 
for both treatments. 
 
4.4.2 Case Study 
    The case is run for four cycles (one year) to show the budget allocation result of 
the collected data. In the case study, we use the mathematic software, Lingo, to run 
the model to obtain the results. In order to avoid the run-off caused by the decimal of 
the cost function, the unit of cost is set to be “a million”. The setting of cost function 
is collected from the data in BNHI to match the condition in Taiwan. 
    Given the cost functions set in the model, we can find the maximum objective 
value and the investment combinations. In Table 4.4, it shows the results of the case 
study of the budget allocation model.

    The result of the budget allocation model shows that the priority of investments 
is the budget x , and then the budget z . In order to analyze how the change of the 
coefficient will start to invest in the second program, i.e. the budget item y . The 
sensitivity analysis of these coefficients ratio between these three cost functions is 
done in the next section. 
 
4.4.3 Sensitivity Analysis of Budget Allocation Model 
    As we know, the effects of three popularization programs are unknown, i.e. the 
cost function of these three popularization program can’t be estimated correctly. 
Therefore, all combinations of coefficient among the cost function of three programs 
are needed to being considered in order to obtain the sequence of budget allocation. In 
this section, the setting of coefficient among the cost function of three programs is 
shown and later the results of the order for budget allocation is presented. 
    The ratio between these coefficients is changed to analyze how the change of 
these ratios will influence the results of investment order. According to the results of 
the cases, the data collected and results are summarized as follows in Table 4.5. 
 46
Finally, the computational results of budget allocation model shows that the sequence 
of budget investment is x z y→ →  under the cases in Taiwan. However, the amount 
of each investment is different depends on the coefficient ratio between the cost 
function and the budget limitations of each program. 
    Extensions of this research can be performed in the following directions: (1) 
estimation for the productivity loss of patients’ family; (2) estimation for costs of 
multiple diseases; (3) the characteristics of cost function; (4) different standpoints 
between the government, patients and hospitals; and (5) the transplantation state is a 
temporary state.
