2. Problem description  
In magnetic tumor hyperthermia, fine magnetic 
particles are localized at the tumor tissue. The literatures 
[14, 20, 21] regarded the small tumor as a solid sphere 
with the radius R and becomes a heat source of constant 
power density P in the small tumor for excitation of 
alternating magnetic field. The heat source is assumed 
to be surrounded by a medium of homogeneous heat 
conductivity. The heating material, e.g. magnetic 
particles injected into the tumor, and the surrounding 
medium are characterized by the values of their heat 
conductivity k, their specific heat capacity c, and their 
mass density ρ. Because of the spherical symmetry of 
the system and the homogeneous time-independent 
power density P inside the sphere the temperature 
distribution depends only on distance r from the center 
of the sphere and on time t. For experimental study, 
Andrä et al.[13] made the heating material of 
carrageenan and a variable amount of magnetite with a 
mean grain size of 1 µm and embedded it in extended 
muscle tissue from cow. The spatial distribution of 
temperature increase as function of exposure time was 
measured with thermocouples as shown Fig. 1. 
The linearized form of the DPL model is based on 
the equation 
 
rt
Tk
r
Tkq
t
q
Tq ∂∂
∂−∂
∂−=+∂
∂ 2ττ  (1) 
where T is the temperature and q is the heat flux. τq 
means the phase lag of the heat flux and τT means the 
phase lag of the temperature gradient. In bio-heat 
transfer, Antaki [12] interpreted τq as a delay time for 
contact resistance between tissue particles. On the other 
hand, τT was interpreted as a measure of the conduction 
that occurs within tissues particles. The heat flux 
precedes the temperature gradient for τq < τT. The 
temperature gradient precedes the heat flux for τq > τT. 
The DPL model depicts that not only the temperature 
gradient may precede the heat flux, but also the heat 
flux may precede the temperature gradient. The values 
of τq and τT may be different in tumor and normal tissue 
as well as the other physiological parameters. For 
convenience of estimation, the present work assumes τq 
and τT constant and predicts them from the experimental 
data given by Andrä et al.[15]. As τq = τT = 0, the DPL 
model would become the classical model of heat 
transfer. The classical bio-heat transfer equation was 
derived based on the classical model of heat transfer. 
In a local energy balance, the one-dimensional 
energy equation of the present problem is given as

∂−=∂
∂ )(2 ρρ (2) 
where ρb and bc respectively are the density and 
specific heat. The spatial heating source rq  is defined 
as )(tuPqr = , where u(t) is a step function. The 
present work omits the metabolic heat generation 
mq and the perfusion rate of blood bw  for that the 
experiment was not performed with living tissue. 
Substituting Eq. (1) into the energy conservation 
equation (2) leads to the heat transport equations in the 
heating material and the extended muscle tissue with 
constant physiological parameters as the following:

In order to estimate the target parameters from the 
experimental data, the least-squares minimization 
technique is applied to minimize the sum of the squares 
of the deviations between the calculated values and the 
experimental data at the specified measurement location 
ri. The sum of the squares of the deviations between the 
calculated values and the measurement values can be 
expressed as

as follows. 
First, the initial guesses of An are given.

4. Results and Discussion 
In the experiment, the composite consists of 106 
mg magnetite and carrageenan gel with the following 
parameters: k1 = 0.778 W/(K m), ρ1= 1.66 g/cm3, c1 = 
2.54 J/(g K), R = 3.15 mm and a power density of 6.15 
W/cm3. The corresponding parameters of the 
surrounding muscle tissue were taken as: k2 = 0.642 
W/(K m), ρ2 = 1 g/cm3, c2= 3.72 J/(g K). 
Measured values of the increase of temperature 
for the parameters described above are plotted in Fig. 2 
with symbols indicating the various reduced distances: 
 6
and τT2= 14.5465 s. It is obvious that the present results 
approach the experimental data more, even in the early 
times. With time passing over, the calculated values 
from the classical bio-heat transfer equation gradually 
approach the experimental data. This agrees with that 
the non-Fourier effect would dissipate with time. 
Correspondingly, the classical thermal behavior would 
be dominant with the distance from the center of sphere. 
It is observed from the results in Fig. 9 that the 
calculated values from the classical bio-heat transfer 
equation approach the experimental data with the value 
of r/R increasing. In other words, the thermal wave 
propagation is gradually replaced by the diffusion 
behavior with the penetration distance of thermal signal 
increasing. The above results enhance the features of the 
non-Fourier thermal behavior in the experimental data. 
 
5. Conclusions  
This work investigates the dual phase lag thermal 
behavior in tissue through an inverse bio-heat problem 
in the spherical coordinate system. The values of the 
phase lag times, τq and τT, are estimated in accordance 
with the experiment data. The calculated results of the 
history of temperature increase agree with the 
experimental data at various measurement locations. 
Various features of the non-Fourier thermal behavior are 
observed from the present results. The beginning of 
thermal response is later with the longer distance of the 
measurement location from the center. It is the behavior 
of finite propagation of thermal signal. The larger value 
of qτ  makes the beginning of thermal response later. 
The present results very approach the experimental data 
and gradually close to the calculated values from the 
classical bio-heat transfer equation with time. This 
phenomenon agrees with that the non-Fourier effect 
would dissipate with time. In the mean time, the 
classical thermal behavior would be dominant with the 
distance from the center of sphere. These features give 
the first evidence to the dual phase lag thermal behavior 
in muscle tissue from cow. 
In accordance with the present results, it should 
be worthy to have further experimental study for the 
dual phase lag thermal behavior in tissue. It will be 
helpful to the relevant developments. The solution of the 
inverse problem may become sensible to measurement 
errors of the input data, so this work has no certain 
values for τq and τT. This work approximately estimates 
the values of τq and τT in muscle tissue from cow about 
τq = 7.36-8.43 s and τT = 14.54-21.03 s. This result can 
be the reference for further study. 
     The present have been written into two papers in 
English. One was accepted for publish in International 
Communication in Heat and Mass Transfer; the other 
has been summated to International Journal of Heat and 
Mass Transfer.
