thermodynamic (electrostatic and steric repulsion forces) mechanisms on the transport of 
colloids could all be considered. However, the energy-barrier condition has not been found 
computed by the trajectory approach in any known cases, only the energy-barrier-free cases 
have been prevalent, such as one in Happel sphere-in-cell (Nelson and Ginn 2005) and 
another in hemispheres-in-cell models (Ma et al. 2009) to predict the deposition of bare 
particles at various sizes. Other than the mechanistic model, semi-empirical models have also 
been implemented to model the transport of bare or macromolecule coated particles in porous 
media.  
This study was motivated to fulfill the need for an estimating tool based on mechanistic 
colloid transport. This research first developed a trajectory simulation algorithm with 
constricted-tube model, which would provide accurate predictions of the deposition of 
submicrometer particles moving through porous media in both the absence and presence of 
interaction forces with acceptable computation efforts. Next, the proposed algorithm was 
tested to demonstrate its performance by comparing the simulation results with the existing 
theoretically predictions under energy-barrier-free condition and experimental data of SNZVI 
which is incorporated with the effect of steric repulsions. 
 
1.2 Algorithm of Trajectory Simulation  
1.2.1 Geometry of the collector for simulating the porous media.  
Differing from the commonly employed models using Happel sphere-in-cell (Ma et al. 
2009) or Hemishperes-in-cell (Nelson and Ginn 2005) geometry in trajectory simulation, 
constricted-tube geometry (Payatakes et al. 1973) has been chosen to account for the 
geometric nature of the pores where collectors (soil grains) are piled up and leave many 
interstitial pores with constricted passages. The sinusoidal constricted tube adopted in this 
study has wall geometry described as

where wr  is the wall radius, mr  (= max(  ) / 2cr r ) is the average tube radius, maxr  is the 
maximum radius of the tube, cr  is the radius of the constricted throat, z  is the Cartesian 
coordinate of axial direction, and h  is the length of constricted tube. The two-dimensional 
coordinate represents a three-dimensional flow under the assumption of axisymmetric flow. 
For the simulation of filtration, it is assumed that the filter bed is composed of a number of 
unit bed elements (UBEs) connected in series. Each UBE contains a number of constricted 
tubes in uniformed size. The total number of the constricted tubes present in a UBE, cN , is

1.2.4 Estimation of collection efficiency  
The method of the estimation of collection efficiency is based on the limiting particle 
trajectory concept. According to Tien and Ramarao (2007), the limiting particle trajectory is 
defined as that the trajectory which barely grazes the collector. Limiting particle trajectory 
occurs when the Brownian diffusion effect is insignificant. A particle entering the tube at a 
specific position could be collected before exiting the tube. Once this specific position is 
established, all particles entering at the limiting position, which defines the distance between 
the specific position and the wall, would also be collected before exiting the tube. The 
collection efficiency of the tube could be the ratio of the amount of the fluid entering the tube 
within the limiting position to the total inflow. For the constricted-tube collector, the 
collection efficiency of limiting trajectory would be (Pendse and Tien 1982)

If the effect of Brownian diffusion is significant, eq 3-25 needs to be modified. In this 
paper, eq 3-26 was created to calculate the total collection efficiency by summarizing the 
probability of collection efficiency of limiting trajectory.

where  0,P R  represents the probability of a trajectory staring at position z = 0, r  = 
R  going to make contact with the tube surface; max pR r a   ; the stream function applied 
here is zero-order. 
To obtain the estimate of  , the initial coordinate of the trajectory was set at (0, 
max pr a ). Then the trajectory sample is taken for every 0.01( max pr a ) interval in r direction. 
Since the tube is axisymmetric geometry, cumulating the ratio of possible amount of the fluid 
entering the tube in two-dimensional cross section is able to represent the collection efficiency 
of a three-dimensional case. The advantage of using this scenario is that the number of 
realizations for each trajectory simulation in the study could be substantially reduced. With 
only little amount of fluid entering the tube in collectable trajectory interval, the probability 
difference between thousand and hundred realizations does not affect the precision of the 
estimation. Hence, the number of realizations can be reduced from the original thousands 
(Nelson and Ginn 2005) down to a hundred in this study. 
 
1.2.5 Implementation of computational program  
A Fortran program was implemented to compute the collection efficiency in accordance 
to the abovementioned equations and the flow field described in Figure 1-2. The Intel Fortran 
compiler (version 11.1.048) with IMSL 6.0 numerical library was applied, with the random 
number generator of IMSL function used to calculate Brownian motion with automatically 
seeding according to the computer clock time. Newton’s method of approximation was used 
to calculate the minimum distance between the particle and the tube surface. Table 1-2 
summarizes the values of the parameters used in the simulation of energy-barrier-free 
 10
1.3 Results and discussion  
1.3.1 Validation of simulated collection efficiency with energy-barrier-free models 
The RT and TE equations are the predictive models extensively used to predict the 
collection efficiency of colloidal particle in energy-barrier-free cases. The effectiveness of a 
trajectory simulation algorithm is validated through the comparison between its results of 
simulation in absence of energy barriers and those of RT and TE equations by using the same 
parameters shown in Table 3-2. It is necessary to note that the geometry of constricted tube is 
different from the one in Hoppel in-sphere-cell. The constricted (throat) and maximum radii, 
which determine the average radius for calculating the average flow velocity in eq 3-3, were 
adjusted to fit the approaching velocity in simulation. The constricted radius is set to be 
0.35 gr according to Pendse and Tien (1982). The maximum radius is set to be 0.865 gr  based 
on the trial for pd  = 10 μ m rather than using the expression in Payatakes et al. (1973). The 
geometric setting is applied for all simulations in this study.

Collection efficiencies produced from simulations adopting the values of parameters in the 
range of those in Tufenkji and Elimelech (2004) are shown in Figure 1-3. The three selected 
fluid velocities are frequently found in natural groundwater systems and are comparable to 
those used in other models and experiments. The results from the new simulation algorithm 
demonstrated good agreements with the results derived from RT and TE equations over a 
wide range of particle sizes except for particle diameter less than 100 nm. A trend was 
observed that the slower the approach velocity is, the greater the difference between the 
simulation results and TE’s results at particle size less than 100 nm will be.  
 
 12
Figure 1-3a shows lower collection efficiencies for particle size less than 100 nm under 
Nelson and Ginn’s (2005) trajectory analysis. As explained in Nelson and Ginn, 
computational domain would better demonstrate the reason of the discrepancies for particle 
size less than 100 nm. The computational domain of our approach is based on the constricted 
tube model, which has varying dimensions of passages and is different from the Happel model 
used in TE or RT where the spherical collector is surrounded by a fluid envelope with uniform 
thickness. According to Song and Elimelech (1992), Happel model is valid only with 
moderate and larger Peclet numbers, (Pe = / ( / 6 )g pUd kT πμa ). The Peclet number applied in 
Happel model in Figure 1-3 is no doubt in the valid domain (Pe > 70 (33)), which also 
signifies that the diffusion boundary layer is confined within the uniform thickness of the 
fluid envelope. Unlike the Happel model, the constricted tube model does not have a uniform 
boundary but a boundary with varied thickness due to its wall geometry. With thicker 
boundary in some sections of the constricted tube allowing longer diffusion distance and 
lesser chance of being collected, the resulting collection efficiency would be lower than those 
derived from the Happel model for small particles. This explains the discrepancy shown in the 
prediction for particle size less than 100 nm, since the probability of being collected for small 
particles is dominated by diffusive movement. 
 
1.3.2 Comparison with experimental data  
Simulation were conducted in the presence of energy-barrier and compared with four 
cases of NZVI breakthrough experimental data reported in the literature, two of which used 
polyacrylic acid (PAA) dispersed NZVI, one poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) dispersed, and the 
other one used a nonionic surfactant to disperse NZVI. Parameters applied in these four cases 
for calculating the net interactive forces are listed in Table 1-3. The breakthrough tests for 
case 1 and case 4 were conducted in our laboratory, with details explained in Table 1-4. Cases 
2 and 3 take the representative researches on polymer modified NZVI by Schrick et al. (2004) 
and Phenrat et al. (2009), respectively for our simulation. Some parameters used for model 
simulation could only be adopted from literatures, with barely a few being reasonably 
assumed.

NZVI modified by surfactants or polymers incurs double-layer and steric repulsions. Net 
force from these repulsions and van der Walls attraction is the key element in influencing 
SNZVI contact with porous media. The changes in net force with respect to the separation 
distance between particle surface and collector surface for these four cases are depicted in 
Figure 1-4. A simplified model is used to calculate the net force between modified particle 
surface and collector surface. The model with details explained in Figure 1-5 can be 
envisioned as a particular case of Ohshima’s soft particle theory (1995) with the assumption 
that the softness parameter is so small that the polymer and surfactant coated particle behaves 
like a rigid particle. Then, the slipping plane is positioned outward from bare particle surface 
to near the interface of bulk liquid and coated material. 
Based on the simplified model, the value of Hamaker constant applied to calculate van der 
Waals force was adopted from the value of polymer or surfactant in water. Measured zeta 
potential and ion strength were used to estimate double-layer repulsion, which was considered 
to be significant in the nonionic surfactant case due to high ionic strength measured at 0.08 M. 
Steric repulsion considered in cases 1, 2 and 3 was estimated by referring to the parameters 
from literatures under the similar condition; except for case 3, where an assumption of 
compressed thickness of polymer and a fitting value of distance between the polymer chain 
anchoring points were made due to the lack of reference. 
Figure 1-4 shows that although the same PAA with an average molecular weight of 2,000 
as used, the near-surface repulsion in case 2 is smaller than that in case 1 due to higher ionic 
strength and consequently different values of parameters like the length of polymer. Steric 
repulsion seems dominant in case 3 with thicker dispersant layer due to larger polymer and a 
higher dosage on the surface. Also, double layer effect is negligible according to the 
estimation from default values of parameters.  Therefore, a low repulsive force is extended 
to a longer distance from the surface in case 3, as compared to other cases. As the end result, 
case 4, with the use of nonionic surfactant, exhibited the highest energy barrier. The same 
surfactant applied in the field study (Wei et al. 2010) also demonstrated good SNZVI mobility, 
with the same trend predicted in case 4. 
Simulation and experimental results of the collection efficiency from the four data sets 
are compared in Figure 1-6. Of which, exp  were estimated by using eq 1-27

 16
As Figure 1-6 indicates, the simulated results for predicted collection efficiencies of 
polymer-modified NZVI in three data sets correlate with experimental results. But the 
collection efficiency predicted from NZVI dispersed by nonionic surfactant is overestimated 
comparing to the experimental results. The inset of Figure 1-6 shows that the attachment 
efficiencies of the four data sets are comparable, except for a slight underestimation for the 
PAA-dispersed experimental set in case 2. 
In the nonionic-surfactant case, the surfactant concentration of 5,000 mg/L, exceeding 
the critical micelle concentration, would create micelles in the suspension, as was observed in 
the results of our particle size analyses. Due to the forming of nonionic surfactant micelles, 
there is another external force called oscillatory structural force, which is also known as 
hydration force that is suspected to increase the repulsive force (Christov et al., 2010). Under 
such circumstance, the van der Waals and double-layer forces are not the only forces acting on 
particle surface. The lack of consideration for other external forces may result in the 
discrepancies between our simulation results and the results of the experiments with nonionic 
surfactants. 
 
1.3.3 Environmental Implications of the New Trajectory Simulation Algorithm 
Since the simulation results demonstrated a good agreement with the SNZVI transport 
experiments, it would be beneficial if the new trajectory simulation algorithm could be 
applied to the prediction of the transport and deposition of other anthropogenic nanoparticles 
in the porous media to better understand the impact on the actual environment. Lecoanet et al. 
(Lecoanet et al., 2005) have presented a well-defined system to assess the mobility of 
particles with size from 1.2 nm to 303 nm in porous media. One of their results showed that 
the monodispersed silica with size around 57 nm gain breakthrough ratio up to 97% through a 
9.25 cm column at 0.04 cm/s linear velocity. Comparing to the experimental results of 
Lecoanet et al., the simulated collection efficiency, 0.00011, is close to the experimental 
result of 0.00013, with the experimental setting of particle size at 57 nm, zeta potential at 
-29.8 mV and Hamaker constant at 1.710-20 J (Russel et al., 1988) for silica in water. 
With the capability of further predicting the collection efficiency for particles smaller 
than 100 nm, the proposed approach is ready to be applied to predict the transport of 
biological colloids (such as bacteria and viruses) in the porous media to lower the impact on 
water environment. The new approach could also help in evaluating the fate of newly or 
in-progress engineered nanoparticles to adhere to green design standards. As for engineering 
applications, the proposed method is available to assist on the design of filtration system for 
treating nanoscale particles.  
Some modifications can be taken for future applications. First, variable distributions of 
particle and collector size can be accepted. Also, the effects of agglomeration/aggregation 
(Phenrat et al. 2010; Hotze et al. 2010) should be notably considered during particle transport 
in porous media. Lastly, particle entrapment, which affects the size and shape of collector, 
should be taken into account for practical interest.

sources. A biodegradable surfactant, octadecyl dihydrogen phosphate (ODP) was chosen due 
to its ability to strongly bind hydrophilic ends to iron oxide surfaces via phosphate complex 
bond (Yee et al. (1999)) and form hydrophobic surface on nano particles (Wang et al. (2006)). 
With the hydrophobic ends facing outward, NZVI turns into hydrophobic NZVI (HNZVI). 
The affinity of HNZVI to different oil interfaces was examined to constitute dense stable 
suspension which could mimic the important properties of DNAPL. The characteristics of the 
suspension were then determined to access the best stability of suspension. A bench-scale 
batch test was also conducted to investigate the reactivity of dense HNZVI suspension for the 
degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE). A good performance for TCE degradation could 
demonstrate the potential of synthesized HNZVI in groundwater remediation. 
 
2.2 Materials and methods 
2.2 .1 Synthesis of surface modifier, ODP  
ODP was synthesized by the esterification method. First, 9.5 g (0.11 mole) of 115% 
polyphosphoric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, as P2O5 > 83% ) was added into the reactor, then 6.35 g 
(0.09 mole) of P2O5 (J.T. Baker, analytical) was added and stirred  for 5 minutes at room 
temperature. The acid solution was slowly stirred for 2 hours in silicone oil bath at 55~65 , ℃
then cooled down to 40 . ℃ In the meantime, 38.8 g (0.14 mole) of octadecyl alcohol 
(C18H37OH, Alfa Aesar, 97%) was introduced into the reactor. The reactor was heated to 80 
°C in oil bath and stirred for 8 hours. After adding 5 ml 30 % H2O2 (GR grade, Japan) into the 
system, the esterification reaction was maintained for 2 hours at 80 ℃,  then cooled down to 
40  as the raw product for the next purification procedure.℃  
 Purification procedure was applied by ethyl ether extraction. The raw product of ODP 
was introduced into a 250 ml separatory funnel with additional 100 ml ethyl ether (99%, GR 
grade, Japan) and 25 ml Milli-Q water (Millipore Quantum EX). The funnel was shacked to 
mix completely for one minute, then let standing for one hour to separate the different phases. 
The water was drained and the remaining ethyl ether solvent was evaporated with a rotary 
evaporator to obtain the purified ODP. The characterization of purified ODP was analyzed by 
1H-NMR at 400 MHz (Bruker DMX-300) with (CD3)2SO as slovent. A titration method by 
applying sodium hydroxide and 80% ethanol as solvent was used to determine the 
compositions of ODP, which included phosphoric acid, monoalkyl and dialkyl phosphoric 
acid, as designated as PA, MAP, DAP in this paper, respectively. 
 
2.2 .2 Preparation of hydrophobic NZVI 
Bare NZVI was prepared by reducing ferric ion with sodium borohydride. A mixture of 
0.18 M of ferrous sulfate solution (FeSO4·7H2O, Merck, analytical) was slowly added into 
0.54 M of sodium boronhydrate (NaBH4, Riedel-de Haëne, analytical) solution with 
continuous stirring. The solution was degassed by sonicationuntil there was no hydrogen 
ebullition. Bare NZVI was then washed five times with deoxygenated milli-q water (purged 
by nitrogen to have a lower oxygen concentration than 0.2 mg/L). The washed bare NZVI was 
rinsed again with ethanol to reduce the water content. Poly acrylic acid (PAA) (Aldrich, MW 
1,800) modified NZVI (designated as PAA_NZVI) was prepared with the above similar 
process except 5000 mg/L of PAA was added with sodium boronhydrate. 
The hydrophobic NZVI (HNZVI) was prepared by testing different ODP:NZVI ratios in 
the range between 1% and 10%. ODP (concentration between 3.5% and 10% weight ratio) 
was added with 90ml methanol (Merck, analytical) into a reactor. The methanol solution was 
mixed for 5 minutes by sonication. The corresponding concentrations of bare NZVI and

2.3 Results and discussion 
2.3.1 Characterization of ODP 
The characterization of ODP conducted by 400 MHz 1H-NMR is shown in Figure 2-1. 
The spectrum shows 0.84-0.88 ppm (t, 3H, terminal -CH3), 1.236 ppm (m, 30H, long chain 
-(CH2)15-), 1.39 ppm (quintet, 2H, POCH2CH2), 1.53 ppm (broads, 2H, -PO3H2) and 3.77 ppm 
(quintet, 2H, POCH2), which is consistent with the results from Brovelli et al. (Brovelli et al., 
2000). The titration curves and the added amount of NaOH per pH value for determining the 
compositions of raw and purified ODP were listed in Figure 2-2 and Figure 2-3, respectively. 
Table 2-1 shows the compositions of raw and purified ODP measured by the titration method. 
The percentage of MAP was increased to 94.90 % after the purify process.

2.3.2 Characterization of hydrophobic NZVI 
2.3.2 .1 FTIR measurements 
Figure 2-4 illustrates the FTIR spectra of HNZVI and ODP without NZVI. The peaks of 
the ODP under the three conditions appearing at approximately 1026, 1240-1180 and 717 
cm-1 represent P-OR, P-O- stretching vibration with P=O, and P-C vibration, respectively. 
This is consistent with the chemical structure of the ODP (Bala et al., 2005). In comparison, 
two types of P-O remained from the properties of ODP in the presence of NZVI, P-OR (1026 
cm-1) and P-OFe (972 cm-1, due to the weak binding between Fe and O). P-O- stretching 
vibration with P=O at 1240-1180 cm-1 still exists due to the incomplete reaction. Though the 
peak spectra of hydrophobic NZVI are low at 2917, 2848 and 2940 cm-1, they represent both 
asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of CH2, and CH3 stretching just like the 
spectra of the ODP. 
Figure 2-5 illustrates the FTIR spectra of ODP coated PAA_NZVI, ODP, PAA_NZVI 
and PAA. The peaks of PAA appearing at approximately 1705, 1451, 1242-1160 and 900 cm-1 
represent C-O- dimer with C=O, C-O vibration, O-H blending vibrations in plane, and O-H 
blending vibrations out of plane, respectively. This is consistent with the chemical structure of 
the PAA. After applying PAA to dispersed NZVI, the main peak at 1705 cm-1 disappears. 
There are two peaks appearing at between 1648-1540 and 1370 cm-1, representing the 
existence of COO-Fe+ complex bond. O-H- stretching vibration with C=O at 3365 cm-1 
represents the monodentate bond also exists in PAA_NZVI. As for the spectra of ODP coated 
PAA_NZVI, peaks at 2848, 2917 and 2940 cm-1 represent the existence of the hydrophobic 
ends. P-O- stretching vibration with P=O at 1242-1180 cm-1 disappears, and the peaks of 
P-OR at 1026 cm-1 and P-OFe at 972 cm-1 are low. It is speculated that ODP is bonded to PAA 
by molecular interface forces such as hydrogen bonds or anhydride. Koolman and Roehm 
(2005) mentioned that phosphoric acid and carboxylic acids bind to form anhydride during 
biomolecular interaction. Anhydride is one of the important byproducts in cell metabolism. 
P-O-C at 1030-1090 cm-1 indicates the existence of anhydride (Daasch and Smith, 1951). The 
peak at 1061 cm-1 shown in Figure 2-5(a) could be the evidence of the formation of anhydride 
on ODP coated PAA_NZVI.

2.3.3 The testing of hydrophobic properties  
To comprehend if the synthesized HNZVI can touch hydrophobic DNAPL, TCE is 
utilized in the following tests. The red layer at the bottom of Figure 2-12(a) is TCE dyed with 
O Red Oil, which descends to the bottom since oil is heavier and not dissolvable in water. 
Figure 2-12(b) shows a sample of Figure 2-12(a), with added HNZVI suspending on surface. 
In Figure 2-12(c), sample jar from Figure 2-12(b) was shaken to allow HNZVI to completely 
dissolve in TCE. Figure 2-12(c) clearly demonstrates that upon modification, HNZVI are 
indeed hydrophobic.

2.4 Conclusions 
This study demonstrates the ability of a synthesized surfactant, octadecyl dihydrogen 
phosphate (ODP), to modify the NZVI surface to be dispersed preferentially to the oil 
interface and to promote the colloidal stability. ODP has been  identified to clad hydrophilic 
ends to the surface of bare NZVI via phosphate complex bond and to the surface of 
polyacrylic acid (PAA) modified NZVI via hydrogen bonds or anhydride. With the 
hydrophobic ends facing outward, NZVI turns into hydrophobic NZVI (HNZVI). HNZVI was 
then dispersed in 1-octanol to constitute stable and dense suspensions at 300 g-iron/L 
concentration. Bench-scale batch tests showed a good performance for trichloroethylene 
degradation by the dense HNZVI suspension. The measured pseudo first-order rate constant 
of degrading trichloroethylene with initial concentration at 4,384 mg/L by HNZVI suspension 
was 0.002 hr-1. It indicated that the novel dense HNZVI suspension is an effective reagent for 
the remediation of DNAPL sources.
