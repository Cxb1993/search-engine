Abstract
This work studies variational inequalities
for fuzzy mappings over a fuzzy domain. It is
shown that such problem can be reduced to a
regular bilevel programming problem. Some
basic analysis of the solution optimality
conditions is presented. A penalty function
algorithm is introduced with a convergence
proof, and numerical examples are included
to illustrate the theory and solution
procedure.
Keywords: Variational Inequalities, Fuzzy
Optimization, Mathematical Programming
二、緣由與目的
Variational inequalities have been
widely used as a mathematical programming
tool in modeling many optimization and
decision making problems. However, facing
uncertainty is a constant challenge for
optimization and decision making. Treating
uncertainty by fuzzy mathematics results in
the study of fuzzy optimization and decision
making. Recently, Chang and Zhu [4]
introduced the concepts of the variational
inequalities for fuzzy mappings and later
developed by Noor [13,14,15], Chang and
Huang[3], and Lee et al. [11]. Inspired and
motivated by the recent research works on
this subject, this paper considers the
variational inequalities in a fuzzy environ-
ment, where the rigid requirements of strictly
satisfying the inequalities with a crisp
domain are to be softened and can be
described as follows.
Find nRx such that
Vx~ (1)
,z,0~x-z),( VxF 
where V is a convex set of nR , F is a
mapping from nR into itself, ~ denotes
the fuzzified version of “”with the
linguistic interpretation “approximately in”,
0~x-z),(  xF are fuzzy inequalities,
,z V and “~ ” denotes the fuzzified
version of “” with the linguistic
interpretation “approximately greater than or
equal to”.
It is well known that variational
inequalities is equivalent to the generalized

that is, ,0)(' xFd i ,,21 m,,i  where
'
id is normal to id [16]. Therefore, the
fuzzy generalized complementarity problem
(4) can be rewritten as:
Find nRx such that
,,21,0~ m,,ixd i 
,0~x),(  xF
,0~)(' xFd i ,,21 m,,i 
or
Find nRx such that
,,21,0~ m,,ixd i 
,0~x),(  xF (5)
,0~x),(  xF
,0~)(' xFd i ,,21 m,,i 
We see that problem (5) is a system of fuzzy
inequalities.
Following the work of [2,18], a solution of
(5) can be obtained by solving the following
“min-max” problem

(6)
where ,22,,2,1),(~  mjx

 is the
membership function of each fuzzy
inequalities in (5). One major difficulty
encountered in developing solution methods
forsolving the “min-max” problem (6) is the
non-differentiability of the max function
(x).~D A distinct feature of the recent
development centers around the idea of
developing “smooth algorithms” [7,9].
Among them, a class caled “regularization 
methods” has been developed based on
approximating the max function (x)~D by
certain smooth function \cite{1,5,9}. Here we
adopt the newly proposed “entropic 
regularization procedure”[8,12]. This
procedure guarantees that, for an arbitrarily
small> 0, an-optimal solution of the
min-max problem (6) can be obtained by
solving the following problem

with a sufficiently large, where (x) is a
smooth function which approximates (x)~D
uniformly and accurately when is taken
sufficiently large. It should be noted that in
practice a sufficiently accurate approximation
can be obtained by using a moderately
large.
Also because (x) appears in a special
“log-exponential” form, it is highly smooth 
and avoids most over-flow problems in
computation. The commonly used BFGS
subroutine is then adopted here for solving
the unconstrained smooth optimization
problem (7). This subroutine is a modified
Newton's method, which replaces the
Jacobian matrix in Newton's method with an
approximation matrix that is updated at each
iteration. It is well-known that the BFGS
subroutine converges superlinearly [6].
四、成果自評
In this work we study variational
inequalities over a fuzzy domain and
variational inequalities for fuzzy mappings
over a fuzzy domain. The concept of level
sets has been adopted to convert the
problems into bilevel programming
problems. Some optimality conditions and
existence results have been discussed. A
penalty function algorithm has been proposed
to solve the fuzzy variational inequality
problems in terms of bilevel programming.
The convergence theorems show that the
penalty function method generates a
sequence of points converging to the
“maximizing solution" of the fuzzy
variational inequality problem under some
mild assumptions.
