Abstract 
Quantum-dot infrared photodetectors (QDIPs) with InGaAs capping layers are investigated. Compared 
with the standard QDIP with 2.5 mono-layer (ML) InAs QDs, the detection wavelength is shifted from 6 to 
7.9 µm for an 8 nm InGaAs-capped QDIP. By decreasing the QD coverage from 2.5 to 2.0 ML, an even 
longer detection wavelength 10.4 µm is observed, which is attributed to the higher energy levels of the QD 
excited states resulted from the smaller QDs. By further increasing the capping layer thickness to 12 nm, 
longer detection wavelengths with broad response 10-18 µm is observed for the InGaAs-capped QDIP. For the 
application of the InGaAs-capped QD structures in broadband detection, we have proposed a 5-period QDIP 
with a bi-stacked QD structure. The device has demonstrated a wide and relatively flat detection response 
ranging from 4 to 11 µm with high responsivities. The results suggest that similar responsivities can be 
obtained for the standard QD and the InGaAs-capped QD layers in the MW- and LW- infrared ranges, 
respectively.

widely investigated [1]-[6]. However, for most of the QDIPs, the detection wavelengths are limited in the 
mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR, 3-5 µm) range. To improve this disadvantage, reports regarding to the InAs 
QDs embedded in InGaAs quantum-well structures (DWELL) have been proposed [7]-[10]. The devices have 
exhibited the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR, 8-12 µm) detection. However, for such devices, an additional 
InGaAs layer prior to the QD growth is always required to achieve the devices operated at longer detection 
wavelengths [11]. With the more complicated structures, device parameter optimization such as underlying 
InGaAs thickness and growth conditions would be required. Therefore, a simpler QDIP structure with tunable 
detection wavelengths from MWIR to LWIR ranges would be advantageous for the application of multi-color 
detection. In this project, we have demonstrated 10-period QDIPs with InGaAs capping layers operated at the 
LWIR range. Compared with the detection wavelength 6 µm of the standard QDIP with 2.5 mono-layer (ML) 
InAs QDs, the insertion of the additional 8 nm In0.15Ga0.85As layer of a InGaAs-capped QDIP would result in 
a detection wavelength shift to 7.9 µm. The results suggest that the dominant transition mechanism in the 
InGaAs-capped QDIPs is from the QD excited state to the InGaAs QW ground state. By decreasing the QD 
coverage from 2.5 to 2.0 ML, a longer detection wavelength 10.4 µm is observed. The phenomenon is 
attributed to the higher QD excited states resulted from reduced QD sizes such that a reduced energy 
difference between the QD excited state and the InGaAs QW ground state is obtained. By further increasing 
the capping layer thickness to 12 nm, an even longer detection wavelengths ranging from 10-18 µm are 
observed for the InGaAs-capped QDIP. 
 
四、研究方法 
    The samples investigated in this paper are grown on (100)-oriented semi-insulated GaAs substrates using 
a Riber Compact 21 solid source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. For all the samples, 600 and 300 nm 
GaAs layer with n-type doping 2 × 1018 are grown as bottom and top contact layers. Four samples with 
10-period (a) 2.5 ML InAs QDs/50 nm GaAs, (b) 8 nm In0.15Ga0.85As/2.5 ML InAs QDs/42 nm GaAs, (c) 8 
nm In0.15Ga0.85As/2.0 ML InAs QDs/42 nm GaAs and (d) 12 nm In0.15Ga0.85As/2.5 ML InAs QDs/38 nm 
GaAs are prepared, which are denoted to as samples A, B, C and D, respectively. Standard photolithography 
and chemical wet etching are adopted to fabricate devices with 100 x 100 µm2 mesas. Edge-coupling scheme 
is adopted for the spectral response measurements of all the devices. The measurement system for the spectral 
response consists of a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100 Fourier Transformation infrared spectroscopy coupling 
with a Janis cryostat and a current preamplifier.

Four peaks are observed in the spectrum, which are the first excited state of the QDs EQD,1, the second 
excited state of the QDs EQD,2, the QW ground state in the InGaAs layer EInGaAs and the wetting layer 
state EWL. As shown in the figure, the energy differences of EQD,2-EWL and EQD,2-EInGaAs are 0.236 and 0.143 
eV (5.25 and 8.67 µm), respectively. The values are close to the observed dominant response peaks 6 and 7.9 
µm at low and higher applied voltages as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The results suggest that the LWIR response of 
device B is resulted from the transition between EQD,2 and EInGaAs states. With increasing applied voltage 
over device B, the dominant transition would change from EQD,2-EWL to EQD,2-EInGaAs, which is attributed to 
the lower energy of the EInGaAs state compared with the EWL state such that the tunneling probability of the 
photo-excited electrons at the EInGaAs state is lower at low applied voltages. 
 
Although LWIR responses are already observed for device B, devices with even longer detection 
wavelengths are still required. In this case, an efficient approach to decrease the energy difference between the 
QD excited state and the InGaAs QW ground state is to push the QD excited state to higher energy levels. To 
achieve this goal, smaller QDs are required. Therefore, sample C with lower InAs coverage 2.0 ML is 
prepared. The 10 K spectral response of device C at 2.0 V is shown in Fig. 3 (a). As shown in the figure, a 
peak response at 10.4 µm with responsivity of 1.17 A/W at 2.0 V is observed, while a much weaker peak is 
observed at 5.7 µm. The high responsivity of the device at 10.4 µm suggests high crystal quality of the sample 
due to standard QD growth procedure is adopted for the device. Without an additionhal InGaAs layer grown 
prior QD growth, the device has exhibited a long detection wavelength up to 10.4 µm. The 10 K PLE 
spectrum of sample C is shown in Fig. 3 (b) with its PL peak energy 1.151 eV as the detection wavelength. As 
shown in the figure, similar peak positions are observed for the energy levels EInGaAs and EWL of samples B 
and C, which suggest that the EInGaAs and EWL states would not change significantly with the QD coverage. On 
the other hand, the QD first excited state has been raised up to 1.235 eV. In this case, the dominant transitions

A five-period QDIP with bi-stacked QD structures is investigated in this report. The bi-stacked QD 
structure consists of a standard 2.5 mono-layer (ML) InAs QDs and an InGaAs-capped 2.0 ML InAs 
QDs separated by a 50 nm GaAs barrier layer. The device has exhibited a wide detection window 
ranging from 4 to 11 μm with high responsivities. The phenomenon is attributed to the high 
performances of the standard QD and the InGaAs-capped QD structures at the mid-wavelength (MWIR; 
3-5 μm) and long-wavelength (LWIR; 8-12 μm) infrared ranges, respectively. The results have also 
demonstrated the possibility of broad detections covering MWIR and LWIR ranges by using stacked 
QD structures without degrading the device performances. The samples investigated in this paper are 
grown on (100)-oriented semi-insulated GaAs substrates using a Riber Compact 21 solid source 
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. The device structures are shown in the table I. Standard 
photolithography and chemical wet etching were processed to define to the devices with 100 x 100 μm2 
devices. The measurement system for spectral response consisted of a Perkin Element spectrum 100 
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) coupling with a Janis cryostat and a current preamplifier [1]. The 10 
K spectral responses of Device A at +2.2 V are shown in Fig. 1 (a). As shown in this figure, a wide 
detection window ranging from 4 to 8 μm is observed for the device. The symmetric high responsivity 
of Device A under positive and negative biases has also demonstrated the optimized growth conditions 
for this QDIP sample. To extend the detection of QDIPs to the LWIR range, a simpler InGaAs-capped 
QD structure with reduced InAs coverage has been proposed [1]. The design of such a structure is to 
upraise the energy levels of the QD structures instead of depressing the energy level of the wetting 
layer. The 10 K spectral responses of the InGaAs-capped QDIP Device B at +2.0 V are shown in Fig.1 
(b). The peak responses at 10.4 and 8.4 μm are observed for this device under positive and negative 
biases, respectively. As discussed in our previous report, the asymmetric peak responses of Device B 
are attributed to the strong Stark effect resulted from the asymmetric InGaAs-capped QD structure [1]. 
The results have also confirmed that by using the relatively simple InGaAs-capped QD structure with 
reduced InAs coverage, high responsivities and LWIR detections could both be achieved. With the 
device performance of standard and InGaAs-capped QDIPs, a straightforward approach to achieve 
broadband QDIPs is to stack the two structures into one device. However, according to our previous 
report, most of the photo-currents of QDIPs come from the QD structure near the cathode side of the 
device [2]. Therefore, for a device with two separate QD regions with different detection wavelengths, 
the result would be a voltage-tunable two-color QDIP as discussed elsewhere [2]. Therefore, a device 
structure with bi-stacked standard and InGaAs-capped QD layers like Device C would be necessary to 
achieve broadband detections. The 10 K spectral responses of Device C at +2.0 V are shown in Fig. 2. 
When this device is positively biased, two response peaks at ~6 and ~10 μm are observed. On the other 
hand, when the device is operated under negative biases, a broad detection window in the range of 4-11 
μm is observed. It is obvious that the response of Device C is the combination of Devices A and B 
under different bias polarities. The results of Device C have already demonstrated the application of the 
bi-stacked QD structure in the development of broadband QDIPs.

    Optoelectronic devices based on the GaSb/GaAs quantum-dot (QD) structures have been 
widely investigated in recent years [1]-[2]. In previous reports, despite its type-II alignment, 
photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) are already observed for GaSb/GaAs QDs 
[1]. In this paper, the LED with a single GaSb QD layer embedded in a GaAs n-i-p structure 
operated under different injection currents and temperatures are investigated. With increasing 
injection currents, room-temperature EL peak blue shift is observed until a saturation of EL 
intensity is reached. The EL peak blue shift before EL intensity saturation has confirmed the type-II 
luminescence of the device and the EL intensity saturation at high injection currents suggests that 
there is an upper limit to the optical recombination efficiency of the injection currents. In the 
temperature-varying EL measurements for the device, with increasing temperatures, EL peak blue 
shift and then red shift are observed. The phenomenon is attributed to the enhanced luminescence of 
the smaller QDs with increasing temperatures at temperature lower than 100 K. At temperature 
higher than 100 K, bandgap shrinkage and intense electron-phonon interaction would result in EL 
peak red shift and intensity reduction. The GaSb QD LED sample discussed in this report is 
prepared by Riber Compact 21 MBE system. With (100)-oriented semi-insulating GaAs substrate, a 
single 3.0 mono-layer (ML) GaSb QD layer are embedded in the GaAs n-i-p structure. The 
room-temperature PL and EL spectrums of the device measured with laser pumping power density 
0.9 W/cm2 and pulse forward injection current 1.0 mA are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in the figure, 
similar PL and EL spectrum curves with two peaks 1.09 and 1.20 eV are observed, which suggests 
that the same transition mechanisms are responsible for the two spectrums. The EL spectrums of the 
device measured under different pulse forward injection currents ranging from 1 to 20 mA are 
shown in Fig. 2 (a). As shown in the figure, when the device is under low injection currents, both 
ground and excited luminescence are clearly observed. With increasing injection currents, EL peak 
blue shift and intensity enhancement are observed. The EL intensity/injection current ratios and EL 
peak energies versus the third root of the injection currents for the ground-state luminescence are 
shown in Fig. 2 (b). The results suggest that there is an upper limit to the optical recombination 
efficiency of the injection currents. The EL spectrums of the LED measured under different 
temperatures with fixed constant forward injection current 1.4 mA are shown in Fig. 3 (a). As 
shown in the figure, when the measurement temperature is below 75 K, the ground-state 
luminescence blue shift is observed with increasing measurement temperatures. However, when the 
temperature is higher than 75 K, EL peak red shift is observed. To investigate this phenomenon, the 
EL peak intensities of the device measured under different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3 (b). As 
shown in the figure, the EL intensity would increase with increasing temperature until 100 K. For 
the measurement temperature higher than 100 K, the EL intensities would decrease with increasing 
temperatures. The phenomenon suggests that when the temperature is lower than 100 K, the 
influence of phonons with increasing temperatures is not significant for the carrier lifetime in the 
GaSb QDs. Therefore, with increasing temperatures, holes confined in larger GaSb QDs would be 
thermally activated such that carrier transport to the nearby smaller dots via the wetting layer would 
become possible. In this case, hole distribution in the QDs would become more uniform such that 
optical recombination processes would increase under the same injection condition. The results 
would be an increasing EL intensity and peak blue shift with increasing temperatures. For the 
temperature higher than 100 K, the bandgap shrinkage and intense electron-phonon interaction 
would result in EL peak red shift and intensity reduction.

Abstract 
The light-emitting diode (LED) with a single GaSb QD embedded in a GaAs n-i-p 
structure operated under different injection currents and temperatures are investigated. 
With increasing injection currents, room-temperature electro- luminescence (EL) peak 
blue shift is observed until a saturation of EL intensity is reached. In the 
temperature-varying EL measurements, with increasing temperatures, EL peak blue 
shift and then red shift are observed, which is attributed to the enhanced luminescence 
of the smaller QDs with increasing temperatures at temperatures lower than 100 K. 
The understanding of the operation mechanisms for the device is advantageous for the

spectrums, while different dominant peaks with lower energy in the PL spectrum and 
higher energy in the μ-PL spectrum are observed. The phenomenon is attributed to the 
state-filling effect frequently observed for InAs QDs [9]. We would therefore attribute 
these two peaks to ground-state and excited-state luminescence, which correspond to 
the transitions between the ground state in the GaAs triangular well to the ground and 
excited state in the GaSb QD, respectively [10]. Also observed is the figure is the blue 
shifts of the peaks under a higher pumping power density, which suggests that type-II 
transitions are responsible for the luminescence [7], [10]. 
The EL spectrums of the device measured under different pulse forward injection 
currents ranging from 1 to 20 mA are shown in Fig. 2. The duty cycle is 5 % and the 
operation frequency is 1 kHz. As shown in the figure, when the device is under low 
injection currents, both ground and excited luminescence are clearly observed. With 
increasing injection currents, EL peak blue shift and intensity enhancement are 
observed. However, by further increasing the injection currents, the EL intensities 
would saturate and the EL peaks would remain unchanged. The phenomenon is more 
pronounced for the ground-state luminescence. Also observed in the figure is the

The EL spectrums of the LED measured under different temperatures with fixed 
constant forward injection current 1.4 mA are shown in Fig. 4 (a). As shown in the 
figure, when the measurement temperature is below 75 K, the ground-state 
luminescence blue shift is observed with increasing measurement temperatures. 
However, when the temperature is higher than 75 K, EL peak red shift is observed. To 
investigate this phenomenon, the EL peak intensities of the device measured under 
different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4 (b). As shown in the figure, the EL intensity 
would increase with increasing temperature until 100 K. For the measurement 
temperature higher than 100 K, the EL intensities would decrease with increasing 
temperatures. The phenomenon suggests that when the temperature is lower than 100 
K, the influence of phonons with increasing temperatures is not significant for the 
carrier lifetime in the GaSb QDs. Therefore, with increasing temperatures, holes 
confined in larger GaSb QDs would be thermally activated such that carrier transport 
to the nearby smaller dots via the wetting layer would become possible. In this case, 
hole distribution in the QDs would become more uniform such that optical 
recombination processes would increase under the same injection condition. The 
results would be an increasing EL intensity and peak blue shift with increasing 
temperatures. For the temperature higher than 100 K, the bandgap shrinkage and 
intense electron-phonon interaction would result in EL peak red shift and intensity
