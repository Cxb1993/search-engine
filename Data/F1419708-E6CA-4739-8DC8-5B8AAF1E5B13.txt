2.1 Reservoir characteristics  
Feitsui Reservoir is an on-channel reservoir located in the northwestern part of Taipei at about 
160 m above sea lever and has an average depth of 90 m, a catchment area of 303 km2, a total 
volume of 406 million km3 and a refreshing rate of 3.0 year-1. It has developed a well stratified 
structure in terms of temperature and density from May to September every year with the highest 
surface temperature up to 38.5 oC and the hypolimnetic temperature about 16 oC.  
2.2 Variation of the distribution pattern of phytoplankton during the past decade 
Water quality data and the abundance of phytoplankton species from 1995 to 2003 were obtained 
in monthly basis by Feitsui Reservoir Authority. Water samples were taken near the dam and at 
other reaches in the reservoir at the depth of 1 meters monthly. The abundance of phytoplankton 
in terms of cell number or cell volume has increased in the past decade (Fig. 1). There were only 
10 species in Feitsui Reservoir in Dec. 1996, but there were 43 species in Nov. 2003 (Fig. 2). It 
indicates that the phytoplankton with larger cells has been gaining dominance and the distribution 
of algae species in Feitsui Reservoir are changing. In fact, Aphanocapsa delicatissima had been 
dominating for a long time with the relative abundance higher then 40% until its sudden decrease 
to lower than 10%, even lower then 1% sometimes, in 2002 and 2003. The replacing species were 
Coelastrum sp., Eutetramorus sp., Aulacoseira sp., Rhizosolenia longiseta and Peridinium sp. 
There must be some environmental factors that have made these changes happen. 
3. METHODS 
3.1 Parameter selection 
Nine major phytoplankton species (Table 1) were chosen to be the targets for species distribution 
analyses. In addition to eleven water quality parameters (see Table 2) three physical 
environmental factors, surface water temperature, temperature gradient and mixing depth were 
chosen for analyses. The water column can be segregated into epi-, meta-, and hypolimnion by 
the density difference produced via warming of surface water. Mixing depth is the depth of the 
upper boundary of the epilimnion. Temperature gradient is estimated with Equation (1). The 
temperatures at depths of 1 and 10 m were used to calculate the temperature gradient in this 
study.

Since the water body near the dam has low refreshing rate and well stratified water column, 
which will retard the solute transport from upstream and bottom water to the surface eutrophic 
zone, the lack of positive correlation between algal cell density and nutrient concentration may be 
attributed to the rigorous uptake of nutrient under limited re-supply of nutrient. Other than 
temperature, which directly affects the growth of algae, temperature gradient and mixing depth 
indirectly control the phytoplankton growth by altering the mixing and mass-transfer efficiency 
of nutrients in the water, and the traveling capability of algal cells, which enables the 
phytoplankton to find better habitats. Therefore, the influence of the seasonally varying physical 
parameters outweights the influence of nutrient concentrations in controlling the composition of 
the phytoplankton community in Feitsui Reservoir. 
4.2 Variation of phtoplankton composition with time  
By separating 30 phytoplankton species some are not shown in Table 1into three groups based on 
their patterns of the results of correlation analyses, we have plotted the seasonal changes of cell 
volume averaged over the 9 years for each month of these three groups in Fig. 3 and 4. There are 
distinct seasonal patterns for these three groups of phytoplanktons. The first group, including 
Ankistrodemus fusiformis, Aphanocapasa delicatissima, Chroococcus minutus, Coelastrum 
polychordum, Coelastrum reticulatum, Cyclotella stelligera, Eutetramorus fottii, Eutetramorus 
tetrasporus, Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis flos-aquae, Oocystis parva, Peridinium 
umbonatum, Pseudoquadrigula sp., which are positively related to temperature and temperature 
gradient, while negatively related to mixing depth, dominates during the summer. The second 
group, including Ceratium hirundinella, Chlamydomonas sp., Gymnodinium sp., Peridinium 
bipes, Staurastrum biexacavatum, Staurastrum gracile, Stephanodiscus astraea, Tetraedron 
regulare, which have no correlation with the above-mentioned three physical parameters, gains 
abundance in summer and finally dominates during September to November. During the winter 
only the third group, including Aulacoseira distans, Chlamydomonas sp., Chroomonas acuta, 
Cryptomonas caudata, Cryptomonas erosa, Cryptomonas erosa, Cryptomonas ovata,

4.4 Relationship between water chemical parameters and the abundance of an algal species 
within a specific cluster of months 
Correlation coefficients obtained from the correlation analyses between the total cell volume of a 
phytoplankton species and a special water chemical parameter in a cluster of months are listed in 
Table 5. There are more but not many cases in which the abundance of a specific alga is 
positively correlated with nutrient concentrations. For example, D-A3 and G-E2 both were 
strongly induced by the concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in months of cluster 3 (months of 
Nov. Dec. and Jan. with the highest mixing depth and the lowest temperature gradient). The 
growth of D-A3, G-E2, P-P2 and D-R1 was enhanced by nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) all in months 
in cluster 1 (May to September with the highest temperature and the most stratified water 
columns). Ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) or reactive phosphorus (RP) was not correlated with the 
growth of any algal species.

By isolating the physical factors we have better understanding on the influence of nutrients on the 
dynamic change of the speciation of phytoplankton. Except for a few periods of time in a year, 
nutrient concentrations in water columns are not strong factors influencing the composition of the 
algal community in Feitsui reservoir. It is understandable that under the condition of limited
