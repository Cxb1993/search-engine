2. 英文摘要 
This plan is planned for first year for continuity. We have already set up a crystal growth system by the 
laser- heated pedestal growth method. In material analysis we find that the nanoparticle in inner cladding of 
double-clad Cr4+:YAG crystal fiber is γ-Al2O3 nanocrystal. The crystal content was found to decrease and line 
distribution with increasing growth speed. Besides the concentration of SiO2, Cr2O3 and CaO in inner 
cladding show a sharp gradient with increasing growth speed. The Cr4+ ion emission intensity ratio of 
high-field sites to low-field sites in the inner cladding with different compositions has been investigated. It 
varies from 7.1% to 11.3% when the concentration of SiO2 increases from26.9 to 43.0 wt %. In addition we 
also find that the stress in core close to inner cladding has tensile stress.

3. 前言 
傳統上由於光纖中OH-離子之吸收，使得光纖通信波長侷限於1.3 µm或1.55 µm附近之低損耗波
段。而隨著網際網路及個人通信等應用的日益普及，未來光纖通信的頻寬需求，勢必愈發殷切。近年
來由於Lucent Tech., Rutger Univ.及 M.I.T.等研究機構及大學之合作努力下，消除了光纖中OH- 離子在
1.4 µm波長之吸收，使得光訊號在1.3 µm到1.6 µm整段達300 nm之頻寬被充分利用成為可能。而伴隨
著光纖通訊的需求急速增加，亦發展出分波多工(Wavelength-division multiplexing, WDM)技術，讓數
十個波長以上的光訊號同時彙整到一條光纖中傳輸，打破以往只能在一條光纖中傳播單一波長的局
面，因此也造成了在光傳輸網路系統中寬頻雷射光源的需求。以摻鉻釔鋁石榴石(Cr4+:YAG)晶體當作
增益介質則相當有潛力可符合這需求。由於摻鉻釔鋁石榴石晶體其能階躍遷3T2→3A2，可產生光波長
為1.3 µm~1.6 µm的自發輻射，這樣的自發輻射可用來研發1.3 µm~1.6 µm波長範圍內之可調波長雷射。

本研究為連續性計畫之第一年研究成果，目前在晶體光纖生長上，已完成利用雷射加熱基座生長
之長晶系統架設，並可獨立生長晶體光纖，而在材料分析上，對於內層纖衣之奈米結晶顆粒之分佈量
測，主要透過穿透式電子顯微鏡(TEM)觀察不同生長速度下，其內層纖衣之結晶顆粒分佈的情形，如
圖 1 所示之 TEM 圖像中，可以觀察到，結晶顆粒大小隨著生長速度加快而變小，此再結晶現象形成
於擴散過程(SiO2擴散進入 YAG)，初期時有少量的奈米尺寸大小之結晶顆粒延著橫切過內層纖衣之線
狀排列形成，然後隨著降低晶體光纖的生長速度，將會有越來越多的結晶顆粒在此線狀結構周圍形
成，且顆粒大小隨之變大。

另外，我們也利用共焦顯微術量測 Cr4+離子在纖心及在內層纖衣之螢光頻譜，如圖 6 所示，Cr4+
離子在纖心之螢光頻譜，其頻譜範圍從 1.2到 1.6 µm，中心頻率在 1.38 µm，頻譜半高寬超過 265 nm，
而 Cr4+離子在內層纖衣之螢光頻譜，其頻譜範圍從 1.15到 1.55 µm，中心頻率在 1.22 µm，頻譜半高寬
約為 225 nm，因此和 Cr4+離子在纖心之螢光頻譜比較起來往較短波長移動(藍位移)，從文獻 [6]中可
知，Cr4+離子摻雜在含矽的氧化物材料內，其發光頻譜範圍可往較短波長移動，其範圍在 1.05到 1.55 
µm，藉由 7個高斯曲線的相加，可得到內層纖衣之螢光頻譜，其個別之峰值為 1166.8 nm、1211.2 nm、
1239.4 nm、1302.0 nm、1335.5 nm、1416.7 nm和 1432.1 nm，而其相對應的半高寬分別如下，即 31.3 nm、
28.8 nm、90.8 nm、24.2 nm、72.8 nm、262.9 nm和 85.0 nm，其中峰值為 1166.8 nm、1211.2 nm和 1302.0 
nm 之高斯曲線半高寬較其他曲線窄很多，我們歸於此三個高斯曲線是 Cr4+離子位於高能場位置
(High-field sites, HFS)，屬於 1E→3A2 的能階躍遷，而另外四個高斯曲線是 Cr4+離子位於低能場位置
(Low-field sites, LFS)，屬於 3T2→3A2的能階躍遷。

093113-2 Chen et al. J. Appl. Phys. 99, 093113 2006II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
A. Growth of double-clad Cr:YAG crystal fiber
The sample was prepared from a Cr4+ :YAG source rod
in the 111 crystal orientation with a cross section of
0.30.3 mm2. The absorption coefficient was approximately
4.5 cm−1 at a wavelength of 1064 nm. After two diameter-
reduction steps, a 68 m Cr:YAG core was produced and it
was then inserted into a fused silica capillary with 76 and
320 m inner and outer diameters. Finally, the same LHPG
system was used as a heat source, and the Cr4+ :YAG-filled
capillary tube was codrawn through the hot spot to form a
three-layer DCF. The diameters of the core, inner cladding,
and outer cladding were 25, 100, and 320 m, respectively.
The compositions of core and outer cladding are wholly
YAG and SiO2 with refractive indices of 1.82 and 1.46, re-
spectively. In the inner cladding region, which is the SiO2
and YAG interdiffusion zone, the normal weight percent of
SiO2 are from 27% to 43%, corresponding to the refractive
indices of 1.66 to 1.58.
B. Composition and fluorescence measurement
The composition of three-layer double-clad fiber was
measured by electron-probe microanalyzer EPMA, JXA-
8900R, JEOL. It is a qualitative and quantitative method for
micrometer-sized elemental analysis of material surface. The
distributions of composition and doping profiles were
scanned across the DCF cross section with the concentration
resolution of 0.01 wt %.
The Cr3+ and Cr4+ fluorescence emissions were excited
by a 532 nm frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser and a
1064 nm Yb fiber laser, respectively. An objective lens with
a numerical aperture NA of 0.65 was employed to achieve
a spatial resolution of 1 m. The Cr3+ and Cr4+ fluorescence
intensities were collected by a silicon detector DET 210,
Thorlabs and InGaAs photodiode G8370-05, Hamamatsu,
and their spectra were recorded by a fiber-coupled spectrom-
eter USB 2000, Ocean Optics and optical spectrum ana-
lyzer 86142A, HP. The more detailed description of the
setup can be found elsewhere.14
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Cr3+ fluorescence mapping and spectrum
Figure 1a shows the concentration of Cr2O3 by EPMA
measurement and its corresponding line scan of Cr3+ fluores-
cence intensity. It is found that Cr2O3 spreads in the region
of core and inner cladding. The Cr3+ fluorescence was
also detected from these two structures, but the emission
intensity in the inner cladding is fivefold weaker than that in
core. It may be attributed to the fact that the emission cross
section in the inner cladding is smaller than that in YAG. The
corresponding Cr3+ fluorescence spectra were shown in Fig.
1b. In the core, it shows a typical Cr3+ :YAG emission
spectrum, which is a sharp R line 689 nm from 2E→ 4A2
transition associated with three phonon sidebands 675, 707,
4 4and 726 nm. In addition, a broad T2→ A2 emission band
approximated with the dash curve as a result of thermal
Downloaded 26 Jul 2006 to 140.121.196.220. Redistribution subject topopulation of the 4T2 state at room temperature was also
observed. The Cr3+ fluorescence spectrum of inner cladding
shows broad-band emission from 650 to 950 nm as a result
of its weaker crystal-field strength compared to YAG
Dq /B=2.6.15 The crystal-field strength of Cr3+-doped
glasses has been reported in the range of 1.8Dq /B2.3
with compositions chosen systematically for fluoride, phos-
phate, silicate, tellurite, and borate glasses.16 The measured
Cr3+ fluorescence in the inner cladding is similar to that in
glass host, which is broad emission from 675 to 900 nm. The
additional apparent peak around 700 nm can be attributed to
Cr3+ :-Al2O3 which is analogous to the so-called R1-R2
lines of Cr3+ :-Al2O3 Refs. 17 and 18 although there is
redshift for the former due to the change in its surrounding.
Here it is fitted into five Gaussian peaks, in order to identify
the Cr3+ emission levels in the inner cladding. The five peaks
are centered at 654.8, 699.9, 710.8, 755.1, and 853.8 nm
with full width half maximum FWHM of 37.3, 16.7, 35.8,
99.8, and 110.9 nm, respectively. The peaks 4 and 5 show
much wider bands than that of others. Consequently, it can
be deduced that Cr3+ associated with 654.8, 699.9, and
710.8 nm are located at the HFS 2E→ 4A2 transition, while

shows blueshift as compared to YAG. It is well known that
the Cr4+ in Y2SiO5 YSO Ref. 22 and Mg2SiO4 forsterite
Refs. 23 and 24 occupy in the Si4+ site that also gives
shorter emission range of 1.05–1.55 m. We may say that
the Cr ions substituted at the tetrahedral Si4+ sites possess
higher transition moment than that at tetrahedral Al3+ sites.
The decomposition of Cr4+ emission spectrum in the inner
cladding is fitted with seven Gaussian peaks with wave-
lengths at 1166.8, 1211.2, 1239.4, 1302.0, 1335.5, 1416.7,
and 1432.1 nm and the corresponding FWHM are 31.3, 28.8,
90.8, 24.2, 72.8, 85.0, and 262.9 nm, respectively. The
Gaussian peaks at 1166.8, 1211.2, and 1302.0 are narrower
than that of other bands. We assigned that the Gaussian peaks
1, 2, and 4 are from Cr4+ located at HFS 1E→ 3A2 transi-
tion, while the Gaussian peaks 3, 5, 6, and 7 are from the
Cr4+ located at LFS 3T2→ 3A2 transition. Some of alumino-
silicate glasses have also shown strong emission around
1.18 m due to the Cr4+ ions occupying the HFS mixed
1E-3T2 to ground
3A2.
12,21 Both HFS and LFS are available
to Cr3+ and Cr4+ in the glass hosts; it is due to the energy
levels separation 4T2 and
2E for Cr3+; 3T2 and

which show the decrease in intensity upon increasing the
concentration of SiO2. It was previously shown by Murata
et al. that the oxygen-excess defects in aluminate and gallate
and alumino-silicate glasses contribute to the formation of
Cr4+ ions from Cr3+ state.19 We may say that the oxygen-
excess defects accompany the Al2O3 and Y2O3 in the inner
cladding. From the EPMA measurement, it is known that the
concentrations of Al2O3 and Y2O3 decrease outward in the
inner cladding. Furthermore, it seems reasonable that the
Cr4+ ions are concentrated near the core and shows much
stronger emission intensity. In Fig. 4b, the Cr4+ emission
intensity of Gaussian peaks occupying LFS also fall off
when increasing the concentration of SiO2. It is found that
the emission intensity ratio of HFS to LFS is from 7.1% to
11.3%, corresponding to the increase in concentration of
SiO2 from 26.9 to 43.0 wt%. Compared to Cr3+, the ratio of
HFS to LFS in Cr4+ to Cr3+ is threefold smaller, possibly due
to the fact that Cr4+ in tetrahedral coordination may likely
occupy the low-field sites, as in most Cr4+-doped crystals,
such as Cr4+ garnets, Cr4+ YSO and Cr4+ forsterite.
IV. CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated the use of microspectroscopy for
measuring the Cr3+ and Cr4+ fluorescence spectra in double-
clad Cr:YAG crystal fiber. The emission spectra of Cr3+ and
Cr4+ are detected from core and inner cladding. The Cr3+
spectrum in YAG shows the sharp R line associated with
three phonon sidebands, while that in inner cladding shows
broadband emission from 650 to 950 nm. The Cr4+ spectrum
shows the representative broad-band emission from
1.2 to 1.6 m with center at 1.38 m. The inner cladding
shows a blueshift from 1.2 to 1.55 m with a peak around
1.22 m. Using multipeak Gaussian fitting for emission
spectra of inner cladding at different positions with 1 m
spatial resolution, the emission intensity ratio of HFS to LFS
was found. It increases from 20% to 29% for Cr3+ and from
7.1% to 11.3% for Cr4+ upon increasing the concentration of
SiO2 from 26.9 to 43.0 wt %. Both high-field and low-field
sites are available to Cr3+ and Cr4+ at the glass host; it is due
to the fact that the energy levels separation 4T2 and
2E for
Cr3+; 3T2 and
1E for Cr4+ for some of the ions within the
large inhomogeneous distribution would be small. In this mi-
crospectroscopy measurement, the change in emission spec-
trum with various compositions of host was found, that is,
the increase of concentration of SiO2 leads to the increase of
crystal-field strength in glass. It may be useful by choosing
the different compositions as host for application to the super
wideband light source in different near infrared NIR emis-
sion ranges.
