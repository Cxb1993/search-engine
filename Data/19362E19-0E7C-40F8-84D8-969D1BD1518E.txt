and transient stability constraints are integrated into the 
SCUC and SCOPF problems. Thus, the objective of the 
SCOPF with transient stability constraints is defined not 
only to minimize the real power loss of network and 
improve the bus voltage profile under pre- or 
post-contingent states, but also to satisfy the transient 
stability constraints during fault occurrence. Thus, whether 
the system is in normal operation (pre-contingent) when a 
fault occurs, or in post-contingent state, its solution can 
ensure that the system can secure operation. The objective 
of SCUC with the steady-state security constraints is 
defined to minimize total generation cost that includes the 
transition cost and the production cost of the scheduled 
combination units. However, the security and optimality of 
system operation should be treated simultaneously for a 
power system economy-security control, thus would add to 
the complexity of system operation [3]-[8]. 
For solving efficiently the both optimal programming 
problems, in this report, a global-oriented particle swarm 
optimization (GPSO) technique with Cauchy mutation 
operator is proposed. The proposed GPSO method 
employed the global-oriented mechanism to enhance the 
computation efficiency of traditional PSO algorithm and 
used a Cauchy mutation operator for escaping local 
minima. 
The effectiveness of the proposed method is 
demonstrated for the IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus and 57-bus 
systems, and compared with the traditional PSO [23] and 
EP [21] in terms of solution quality and convergence rate. 
The results show that the GPSO method has excellent 
effectiveness in solving security-constrained OPF and UC 
problems. 
 
II. SECURITY-CONSTRAINED OPF AND UC PROBLEMS 
DESCRIPTION 
 
The steady-state security constraints and the transient 
stability constraints are the fundamental elements of 
system security assessment.  
 
A. Steady-State Security Constraints 
The steady-state security-constrained OPF formulation 
can be stated as: 
xu
Min
,
 ),( )0()0( xuf            (1) 
s.t.   0),( )0()()( =xug kk ,  for cNk ,...,1,0=    (2) 
0),( )0()()( ≥xuh kk ,  for cNk ,...,1,0=  (3) 
where x is the vector of control variables of 
pre-contingency, such as generator-bus voltage magnitudes, 
transformer tap-settings and shunt capacitor/reactor, while 
u is the vector of state variables, such as bus voltage, 
reactive power output of generators, and rotor angle of 
generators. Objective function (1) is scalar. Equalities (2) 
are the conventional power equations, while inequalities (3) 
are the limits on the control variables x and state variables 
u, and the operating limits on the power system. The 
superscript “o” represents the pre-contingency (base-case) 
state being optimized, and superscript “k” (k>0) represents 
the fault duration and post-contingency states for the Nc 
contingency cases. Moreover, the equality constraints g(o) 
change to g(k) to reflect the outage equipment.  
Figure 1 shows the concept of the feasible operation 
region, which is within the oblique line region. x1 is located 
within the region of steady-state operation of 
pre-contingency; however, it might be unable to satisfy the 
transient stability or security constraints (i.e. bus voltage 
limit and line thermal capacity limit) when suffering the 
specific contingency impact. x2 is located within the region 
of transient stability; however, it might be unable to satisfy 
the security constraints of post-contingency. Moreover, if 
the x within the practical security region can drive the 
minimization of objective function f, it is the optimal 
operation point that is the goal to be achieved in this 
research.

B. Transient Stability Constraints 
Mathematically, the transient stability problem is 
described by solving a set of differential-algebraic 
equations. In order to perform easy numerical integration, 
the differential-algebraic equations can be converted into a 
set of decoupled first-order differential equations that can 
be solved easily using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method. 
The swing equation set with damping neglected is given by

where iii EE δ∠′=′  is the output voltage of the i-th 
generator behind a transient reactance dx′ . iH  is the 
inertia constant of the i-th generator. ijijij YY θ ′∠′=′  are the 
elements of the reduced bus admittance matrix.  
To recognize conveniently the stability performance of 
generators and integrate it into the OPF or UC problem, the 
concept of inertia center can serve as a reference frame 
[7]-[10]. The rotor angles of generators with respect to the 
center of inertia (COI) are employed to indicate whether 
the system is stable or not. For a NG-generator system with 
rotor angle of generator iδ  and its inertia constant iH , 
the position of COI is defined as (6).

When solving the SCUC problem, it is necessary to 
determine first the start-up, shut-down, and generation 
levels of all units over a specified period, which is an 
integer programming problem that can be solved by the 
binary-coded evolutionary algorithm. In addition, the 
scheduled units (combinations) must provide proper power 
for system demand, subject to power balance, spinning 
reserve requirement, generating unit constraints, and 
security constraints in the given interval. Thus, this is a 
non-linear programming problem that can be solved by 
real-coded evolutionary algorithm methods [31]-[35]. 
 
III. Global-oriented Particle Swarm Optimization with 
Cauchy Mutation Operator 
 
One of the main drawbacks of the traditional PSO is 
its premature convergence, especially while handling 
problems with more local optima and heavier constraints. 
To overcome this disadvantage, both the global oriented 
scheme and the Cauchy mutation operator are embedded 
into PSO to enhance the performance of traditional PSO 
algorithm in this paper [36]-[38]. These schemes aim to 
minimize the distances between the particle and its 
previous best location, thus it can explore effectively the 
search space [39]-[41]. 
The Cauchy distributed function is

Step 1 To generate randomly many particles, each particle 
x is a matrix with the dimension equal to Ng×T. Ng 
is the number of generators and T is the number of 
scheduling periods. 
Step 2 Selecting those feasible combinations makes up a 
population X by X=[x1, x2, … , xL]’, where L is the 
size of the population. The population is a 
three-dimensional matrix with the dimension equal 
to Ng×T×L. 
Step 3 Calculate the evaluation value of each particle x 
using the evaluation function given by (24). The 
evaluation value is the sum of production cost and 
transition cost.  
Step 4 Compare each particle’s evaluation value with the 
particle’s Pbest. The particle who owns the best 
evaluation value is set to be Gbest.   
Step 5 Modify the member velocity vi of each particle xi 
according to (36) and max)1( vv ki ≤+ . 
Step 6 Modify the position of particle ix  according to 
(37). 
Step 7 The current particle )1( +kix is set to be pi
best. 
Subsequently, if the best pibest is better than Gbest, 
the pibest is set to be Gbest. 
Step 8 If the maximum number of iterations is reached or 
all the criteria are satisfied, then go to Step 9. 
Otherwise, go to Step 3. 
Step 9 The latest Gbest is the optimal combination. 
 
 
z GPSO-based to SCED 
The objective of steady-state SCED is not only to 
minimize total generation cost but also to enhance 
transmission security, reduce transmission loss, and 
improve the bus voltage profile under normal or 
post-contingent states. The fitness function is as (9). 
Operating procedures of the proposed GPSO-based SCED 
method is shown in Fig. 4. 
 
 
IV. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND RESULTS 
 
A. SCOPF problem 
To verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed 
GPSO-based SCOPF method, the IEEE 30-bus and 57-bus 
systems were tested. The proposed GPSO method was 
compared with the traditional PSO and EP in terms of 
solution quality and convergence rate using the same 
fitness function and particle definition.  
 
Case I: IEEE 30-bus System 
The system contains six thermal units, 30 buses and 41 
transmission lines. Three series FACTS devices (one TCPS 
device and two TCSC devices) are installed on it. The 
TCPS device was installed on branches 27-28. The TCSC 
devices were installed on branches 10-22 and 12-15. The 
load demand is P = 283.4 MW and Q = j126.2 MVAR [3]. 
The detailed characteristics of the six thermal units are 
given in Table AI in the Appendix. Bus 1 is the reference 
bus. 
The system has a total of 20 control variables as 
follows: five active outputs of PV-bus units, six PV-bus 
voltage magnitudes, four transformer-tap settings, two 
var-injection values of shunt capacitors and three 
parameter values of FACTS devices. Because the 
adjustable range of the transformer-tap is 0.90 pu to 1.1 pu, 
and the shunt admittance is 0.0 to j0.1 pu, the adjustable 
step size is 0.01 pu in the transformer-tap setting, and the 
changing step size is j0.005 pu in the shunt admittance.  
The M values of the two discrete variables above are both 
20. The upper and lower limits of the generator-bus and 
load-bus voltages are 0.95 pu and 1.05 pu, respectively. 
The limits of the installed TCPS are taken 00 55 ≤≤− φ  
and the limits of the installed TCSC are taken 
LcL XXX 2.04.0 ≤≤− . 
 
• Parameters of Algorithms 
Through many experiments, the results revealed that 
the appropriate values for c is set to be 1.5. They can yield 
an optimal evaluation value. Therefore, the following 
parameters of GPSO are used: 
• particle length=20, 
• population size =50, 
• continuous variable 2/xv maxi

i = ,  
• number of iterations=30.

Case III: IEEE 57-Bus System 
The system contains seven thermal units, 57 buses and 
46 transmission lines. In addition, four series FACTS 
devices (one TCPS devices and three TCSC devices) are 
installed on it. The peak load demand is P = 1275.8 MW 
and Q = j343.1 MVAR (i.e. average load × 1.02). The 
detailed characteristics of the seven thermal units with the 
valve-point loading effect are given in Table AII in 
Appendix. Bus 1 is the reference bus. 
The system has a total of 35 control variables as 
follows: six unit active power outputs, seven generator-bus 
voltage magnitudes, 15 transformer-tap settings, three 
var-injection values of shunt capacitor and four parameter 
values of FACTS devices. Because the adjustable range of 
the transformer-tap is 0.9 pu to 1.1 pu, and the shunt 
admittance is 0.0 to j0.1 pu, the adjustable step size is 0.01 
pu in the transformer-tap settings, and the changing step 
size is j0.005 pu in the shunt admittance. The M values of 
the two discrete variables above are 20 and 20, respectively. 
The upper and lower limits of the generator-bus and 
load-bus voltages are 0.9 pu and 1.1 pu, respectively. The 
limits of the installed TCPS are taken 00 33 ≤≤− φ  and 
the limits of the installed TCSC are taken 
LcL XXX 1.03.0 ≤≤− . 
• Parameters of Algorithms 
In this study system, through many experiments, the 
results revealed that the appropriate values for c is 1.6. 
They can yield an optimal evaluation value. Therefore, the 
following parameters of GPSO are used: 
• particle length = 35, 
• population size = 50, 
• continuous variable 2/xv maxi
max
i = ,  
• number of iterations = 30. 
 
• Selected Contingency Event 
In the IEEE 57-bus system, a three-phase-to-ground 
fault occurs on line 1-17 near bus 17, the fault is cleared 
0.160 second later coupled with the removal of line 1-17.  
 
• Results  
Figure 8 shows the convergence tendency of the 
average over 20 trials. The simulation results are 
summarized in Table III. The optimal settings of control 
variables that are obtained by the three proposed methods 
are shown in Table IV.  
In terms of convergence rate and solution quality, as 
seen in Fig. 8 and Table III, the GPSO method is still 
superior to the PSO and EP. As can be seen in Table III, 
the average fitness of 16278 obtained by the proposed 
GPSO-based method is better than that obtained by the 
PSO and EP. Moreover, in Table IV, the GPSO method has 
the best fitness of 16129, thus implying a total generation 
cost of $15763, a transmission loss of 17.69 MW and a 
summation of bus voltage deviation of 1.31 pu. Moreover, 
Fig. 9 also shows the swing curves of all rotor angles of 
generator iδ  during the line 1-17 fault that is a stable 
situation. It indicates that G12 generator has the maximum 
rotor angle iδ = -34.54600 at t = 0.5413(s) It satisfies the 
transient stability constraints iδ  < 1000. After line 1-17 
  
 
10
The proposed method yielded simulation results 
including the production cost, transition cost, and spinning 
reserve capacity of each scheduling time interval, 
unit-scheduled for 24-hour duration and the total 
generation cost as shown in Tables VII(a)-VII(b).  
 
As seen in Table VII(a), without considering the 
steady-state security constraints, the total generation cost 
of the best combination of scheduled units is $95,022.0; 
while it is $95,105.3 with considering the steady-state 
security constraints, as shown in Table VII(b). Though the 
total generation cost of later is higher, the security of 
system is better. Figure 11 shows the curve of the 
scheduling generation and load demand.

V. CONCLUSION 
 
An efficient global-oriented particle swarm optimization 
(GPSO) technique with Cauchy mutation operator for 
solving both the optimal power flow (OPF) and the unit 
commitment (UC) with the steady-state security constraints 
and the transient stability constraints is presented. So, 
regardless of the system is in a normal state or a contingent 
state, the security constraints can ensure that the system can 
secure operation. 
The proposed GPSO method employed the 
global-oriented mechanism to enhance the computation 
efficiency of traditional PSO algorithm and used a Cauchy 
operator for escaping local minima.  
The effectiveness of the proposed method is 
demonstrated for the IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus and 57-bus 
systems. The results show that the GPSO method has 
excellent effectiveness in solving security-constrained OPF 
and UC problems. The operation point of the GPSO-based 
SCOPF or GPSO-based SCUC will enhance obviously the 
security of system operation even though the system suffers 
a specific contingency impact.
