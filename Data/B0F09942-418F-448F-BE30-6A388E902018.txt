有許多研究朝向使用非同調 (non-coherent)的方向進行，包括傳送參考 (transmitted 
reference;TR)[21,22]及幅差分(frame differential; FD) [23-25]的方式。因為IR-UWB的發送訊號具
有低工作週期(low duty cycle)的特性，傳統的能量偵測(energy detection; ED)方式可能無法有效
的使用在IR-UWB通信上。使用ED的方式，可能會捕捉到比較高的雜訊能量。使用加權能量檢
測（WED）[26]的技術，可以減輕雜訊的影響。另外，有一種在UWB上已經被廣為討論的訊號
收發方式，稱為TR的方法，也可以減少雜訊的影響。 使用TR的優點除了可以完全接收多路徑
的訊號及不需要事先估測通道的資訊之外，也不需要在接收端產生一個樣本訊號(template

能量傳送參考訊號，另一個缺點則是可能因為參考訊號和資料訊號之間的時間間隔不夠長，而
造成多餘的幅間干擾(inter-frame interference; IFI)。當資料速率越高時，IFI的影響會越嚴重。而
且在TR接收機的積分時間也會影響其性能[27]。使用FD的方式可以避免這些缺點。FD的方法
是利用已知前後兩個幅(frame)內的訊號之間的傳送時間間距(Di)，並將接收到的信號延遲Di的

缺點，還可以保留TR的優點。一種新的符號差分(symbol differential)方法[28-30]，名為timing

Abstract²This study proposes an energy detection based time 
synchronization scheme for IR-UWB systems. The proposed 
synchronization scheme may achieve symbol timing synchro-
nization within a symbol interval. The mean square error (MSE) 
performance of the proposed scheme is compared with that of the 
TDLC algorithm, in both residential line-of-sight (LOS) and non-
line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation environments. The proposed 
time synchronization scheme is appropriate for IR-UWB 
communications because of its low computation complexity and 
excellent MSE. 
Keywords- Synchronization, impulse radio (IR), ultra-wideband 
(UWB). 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
A coherent receiver requires precise channel information 
for multipath energy collection. As the information of 
multipath channel through which these low-power narrow 
pulses propagate is generally still unknown at the 
synchronization stage, peak-picking the output of a sliding 
correlator between the received signal and transmitted 
waveform template leads to an unacceptable level of 
performance and an extremely slow acquisition speed. 
Conversely, a non-coherent receiver uses a received signal as a 
template, which does not rely on any channel information. 
Although a non-coherent receiver is suboptimal, it exhibits 
low hardware complexity and is easy to implement.  
Many studies have attempted to resolve synchronization 
difficulties in TH-IR UWB systems based on non-coherent 
receivers. Conventional ED schemes may not work effectively 
for IR-UWB communications because IR-UWB radios 
typically operate at a low duty cycle. Integrating the squared 
received waveform over the entire symbol period may capture 
some unwanted noise energy. Transmitted reference (TR) 
receivers have one major advantage over coherent receivers in 
that they capture energy from all multipath components at a 
low implementation complexity [1]. However, in TR receivers, 
the integration region of a receiver integrator substantially 
affects its performance [2]. A fast frame-level synchronization 
scheme for TR receivers is discussed in [3]. In that article, 
they divided an initial integration region into M sub-
integration-windows (SIWs), and decided which SIW includes 
the desired signal region. Subsequently, the selected SIW was 
subdivided into M even smaller SIWs in the next step until its 
length during each frame was smaller than a threshold. 
However, a major drawback of TR systems is that 
communication resources are wasted on transmitting reference 
signals. Differential (DF) receivers [4]±[6] utilize a received 
pulse waveform in its previous frame as a reference template 
waveform; thus, a DF transmitter does not send additional 
reference signals. In [6], a novel frame-differential scheme, 
named ³WLPLQJZLWKGHOD\-line combination 7'/&´, was not 
only able to achieve symbol time synchronization within a 
single symbol interval but also obtained better MSE 
performance than did the TDT scheme. In that article, a novel 
receiver front-end, named ³IUDPH GLIIHUHQWLDO GHOD\-OLQH´
(FDL), resembled a series of differential correlators to 
combine all correlation operations from each received signal 
and its delay version in a previous frame. By adding and 
integrating all auto-correlation outputs of the FDL, the 
aggregated output causes a raising edge at every symbol 
boundary, and then the symbol boundary can be estimated by 
detecting the raising edge time. 
The main contribution of this study is the proposal of an 
energy detection based time synchronization scheme, which is 
designated as a frame-differential-combination (FDC) algo-
rithm that not only exhibits lower computation complexity, but 
also demonstrates an improved MSE performance to that of 
the TDLC scheme.

using a decimal TH code selected from [0, Nc), which satisfies

distributed over [0, Ts) ns.

value of the minimal JMSE(Tw), designated as  ÖwMSE TJ , are 
nearly consistent.  
Figure 5 illustrates the comparison of the MSE performance 
of the TDLC and the FDC with single user, 5, 10, and 15 users. 
The users other than the desired user are assigned random TH 
codes uniformly distributed over [0, Nc). The FDC exhibited 
superior performance with a large number of users compared to 
the TDLC. Consequently, the FDC algorithm was more robust 
than the TDLC algorithm against Gaussian noise and MAI 
effects. 
An essential feature of the UWB communication systems is 
the low power consumption. Thus, the computation 
complexity is a critical issue in receivers. The computation 
complexity comparison of the FDC and TDLC algorithms are 
listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the FDC scheme has 
lower hardware complexity than that of the TDLC scheme.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
We developed the FDC algorithm in this study. The 
simulations verified that the time synchronization performance 
of the FDC algorithm is superior to that of the TDLC 
algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed FDC scheme also 
exhibited low computation complexity.

I. UWB Channel Models 
The analysis performed in this study focus on a single user link. The received signal is therefore expressed 
as 
                         ( ) ( )* ( ) ( )tr s t h t n t  ,                             (3) 
where h(t) is the channel impulse response and ( )n t  is additive Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a zero mean 
and a constant variance of oN . Furthermore, this study considers the UWB channel model proposed by the 
 terms, and the wT  is regarded as an integration interval.  
The simulation outputs regarding the above ( )tr , ( )ty , ( )z t  and ( )t  are shown in Fig. 1. If the SNR 
is so large that the noise terms, 1( )t  and 2 ( )t , are so small that the effects of these terms to the ( )t  can 
be ignored, the ( )t  exhibits its peak at a certain time; that is, 
0 0

Subsequently, the estimated arrival time of the first signal associated with the (i+1)-th symbol can be 
derived as 
                   ˆ ˆ1 1signal max wt i t i T    .                               (8) 
 Finally, the estimated time of the (i+1)-th symbol boundary, ( 1)symbolt i  , can be calculated by 
        0ˆ ˆ1 1symbol signal ct i t i c T    .                             (9) 
Notably, the proposed algorithm might not be operable for some specific TH patterns, for 
example
p qD D  for each p q . Therefore, the TH code pattern must be constrained to rule out this 
special case.

In accordance with the IEEE 802.15.4a standard, a signal is transmitted in frames, and each frame 
contains a synchronization header (SHR) record for synchronization and ranging purposes. The SHR 
includes two fields; namely a synchronization preamble (SYNC) field and a start of frame delimiter (SFD) 
field. The SYNC field consists of repetitions of the preamble symbol. By averaging a number of K received 
preamble symbols, the received signal is given by

The analysis performed in this study focus on a single user 
link. The received signal is therefore expressed as 
              ( ) ( )* ( ) ( )tr s t h t n t  ,                   (3) 
where h(t) is the channel impulse response and n(t) is additive 
Gaussian noise (AWGN) with a zero mean and a constant 
variance of No. Furthermore, this study considers the UWB 
channel model proposed by the IEEE 802.15.4a working 
group. The proposed model is a Saleh-Valenzuela channel 
model (S-V model) with a few modifications to fit more 
appropriately the data resulting from UWB measurement 
experiments. The UWB channel impulse response model is 
formulated as follows:

where Lc is the number of observed clusters, Lr is the number 
of multi-path contributions received within the k-th cluster, Xk,l 
is the tap weight of the l-th multi-path contributions received 
within the k-th cluster, Tk is arrival time of the first signal of 
the k-th cluster, Wk,l  is the delay of the l-th multipath 
contribution within the k-th cluster, j is the square root of -1 
here, Ik,l is the phase term which is assumed {±,- ±} with 
equal probability for representing pulse inversion due to 
reflection from dielectric surfaces [7]. In this study, W0,0=0 , 
and T0 is specified as a summation delay time of the 
propagation delay and the asynchronous time offset between 
the clock of the transmitter and that of the receiver. 
The objective of timing synchronization is to estimate the 
delay time T0. The receiver block diagram of the FDC 
synchronization algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1. The 
combinative output signal from all of the Nf lags is given by

are noise terms, and 
the Tw is regarded as an integration interval.  
The simulation outputs of r(t), y(t), and D(t,Tw) are 
displayed in Fig. 2. If the SNR is large enough that the noise 
terms [1(t,Tw) and [2(t,Tw) are small enough for the effects of 
these terms to the D(t,Tw) to be ignored, the D(t,Tw) exhibits its 
peak at a certain time, which is expected to be tmax(i+1,Tw) 
=(i+1)Ts+c0Tc+T0+Tw during each symbol period. The esti-
mator of the tmax(i+1,Tw) with a given fixed Tw value can be 
formulated as

III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The simulations and numerical analyses were performed to 
compare the MSE performance of the proposed scheme with 
that of the TDLC scheme. The channel model CM1 
(residential LOS) and CM2 (residential NLOS) of IEEE 
802.15.4a [9] were used in the multipath scenarios. The frame 
period was chosen to be Tf=NcTc=64 ns, where Nc=64 is the 
number of chips per frame and Tc=1 ns. The symbol period is 
given by Ts=NfTf=2048 ns, where Nf=32 is the number of 
frames per symbol. The transmitted data sequence, di, is
