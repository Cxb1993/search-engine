I、Abstract  
Automatic optical fiber alignment is the 
key to reduce the cost of the packaging process 
for the manufacture of fiber-optic devices. This 
study develops a vision-based active optical 
fiber alignment technique using a piezo-actuated 
moving platform. In the proposed approach, the 
centroid of the optical fibers to be aligned can be 
determined from the captured image so that the 
line equations for the optical fibers as well as the 
alignment differences can be obtained. The 
piezo-actuated motion stage is controlled to 
reduce the alignment difference to a certain 
degree. In addition, a Kalman filter is employed 
to give a prediction about the vision command to 
deal with the visual loop latency problems. 
Experimental results verify the effectiveness of 
the proposed approach.   
Keywords：optical fiber alignment, Kalman 
filter, Visual servoing, IVSC.

II、 Introduction 
Recently, fiber optic transmission has 
become one of the most popular choices for 
long-distance fixed communication links due to 
attractive features such as low cost and high 
bandwidth. However, to maintain high quality 
transmission, the development of a high 
precision alignment technique for optical fiber 
assembly cannot be overlooked. 
In general, the alignment techniques for 
optical fiber assembly can be divided into two 
categories ⎯ passive and active [1]. In the 
passive alignment technique, elements are 
aligned by using passive alignment structures or 
by the use of patterned alignment marks [2]. The 
accuracy of the passive alignment technique 
closely depends on the accuracy of the 
alignment device. In contrast, the active 
alignment technique employs a motion stage to 
adjust the positions of optical fibers so that the 
alignment accuracy is satisfactory. In the active 
alignment technique, the feedback signals for 
the high-precision multi-axis motion stage are 
obtained from the power meters [3][4] or 
machine vision techniques [5][6]. In general, the 
active alignment consists of two steps ⎯ coarse 
positioning and fine positioning. 
On the other hand, the idea of visual 
servoing [7] has been applied to solve the 
problem of object tracking recently [8][9]. This 
paper proposes a vision-based automatic optical 
fiber alignment approach for the coarse 
positioning process, in which a CCD camera is 
used to provide the feedback signal so that the 
piezoelectricity actuated motion stage is 
controlled to reduce the alignment difference to 
a certain degree. The proposed approach can be 
divided into two parts. The first part is “servo 
control”. Since the piezoelectricity actuated 
device (PEA) is a nonlinear element with

The detailed descriptions about the sub-blocks 
inside the control unit and the vision unit will be 
given in the following. 
A. Interpolator 
The interpolator in Fig. 3 is used to convert 
the image plane error Xe which is sampled at 30 
Hz sampling rate to a 1K Hz error signal. Its 
mathematical model is expressed as 
[ˆ ] ( [ ] - [ -1]) [+ = +sv s e e e
v
Te kT nT x k x k n x k
T
-1]  (1) 
where n =1,2,…, Tv/Ts， [ -1]ex k  is the error at the 
(k-1)-th time instant, [ ]ex k  is the error at the 
k-th time instant, Tv =33 ms is the sampling time 
for the outer visual loop, and Ts =1 ms is the 
sampling time for the inner servo loop, 
B. Inverse Model 
The inverse model in Fig. 3 is used to cope 
with effect due to the inherent hysteresis 
phenomenon of the piezoelectricity actuated 
device. It acts like a nonlinear feed-forward 
compensator. Theoretically, with an ideal inverse 
model, the overall PEA motion stage can be 
considered as a linear system. In this study, the 
ascending and descending curves of the 
hysteresis loop are approximated by two 
separate B-splines [11]. For details please refer 
to [12]. 
C. IVSC 
The integral variable structure controller 
(IVSC) is used to deal with the effect due to the 
noise or system uncertainty. Fig. 4 shows the 
control block diagram of a typical IVSC.

In Fig. 4, r is the reference input, X1 the system 
output, f(t) the disturbance. According to [10], 
the mathematic model for the system in Fig.4 
can be expressed as:

where Ueq is the equivalent control input, ΔU is 
used to deal with the effect due to f(t) and 
parameter uncertainty Δai and Δb. Equations 
(3)~(6) show the formulas to compute Ueq and 
ΔU. Note that the detailed derivation of Eq. 
(3)~(6) can be found in [10][12].

In this study, the values for the parameters of 
IVSC are set to: C1=37.44, KI=34.6, Ψ1 = −2, Ψ2

D. Kalman Predictor 
The Kalman filter can be divided into two 
parts ⎯ “prediction” (time update) and 
“correction” (measurement update). Equations 
(8), (9) are the equations for the predictor, while 
equations (10),(11),(12) are the equations for the 
corrector [13].
