To promote the building envelope insulation as a key 
green procurement in Taiwan, the project has 
suggested the following two strategies:  
1. Filing Taiwan＇s building envelope insulation 
promotion program as a Voluntary Carbon Standard 
(VCS) emission reduction project to receive Voluntary

stage research plan: 
1. A feasibility study of building envelope 
insulation in Taiwan as a VCS reduction project 
2.  An empirical research of customers＇ purchasing 
intention increase of building envelope insulation 
after carbon disclosure 
The results of the two-stage plan should provide

Abstract 
Buildings are responsible for 
approximately 40% of global GHG.  Building 
industry should be a top priority for achieving 
GHG emissions reductions.  Building 
envelope insulation, which reduces unwanted 
heat loss or gain and can decrease the energy 
demands of heating and cooling systems, has 
great potential for delivering greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions cuts during building’s daily 
operation.  However, building envelope 
insulation requirement has not been emphasized 
in Taiwan’s building codes.  With the 
relatively high cost of implementing building 
envelope insulation, very few new building 
projects or home improvement project has 
adopted the matured insulation technologies 
which have prevailed America and Europe.   
To promote the building envelope insulation 
as a key green procurement in Taiwan, the 
project has suggested the following two 
strategies:  
1. Filing Taiwan’s building envelope 
insulation promotion program as a 
Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) 
emission reduction project to receive 
Voluntary Carbon Unit (VCU), which is a 
valuable asset for international emission 
right trading. 
2. Implement carbon disclosure for building 
envelope insulation to boost customers’ 
purchasing intention. 
To examine the effectiveness of the two 
proposed strategies, our research team has 
proposed a two-stage research plan: 
1. A feasibility study of building envelope 
insulation in Taiwan as a VCS reduction 
project 
2.  An empirical research of customers’

Most Flash applications are in the areas of entertainment, commercial promotion, and education, while this 
paper attempts a whole new dimension in “construction scheduling”.  Conventional construction scheduling 
employs network diagram, bar charts, and narrative description to show construction sequences.  Currently, 
there are various commercial scheduling applications, such as Primavera Project Planner (P3) and Microsoft 
Project, available for efficient schedule editing as well as easy reporting.  However, P3 and Microsoft Project 
fail to provide information pertaining to the spatial aspects of construction projects.  Therefore, many 
researchers have tried to use 3D simulation methods to develop perceptible scheduling sequences, however, the 
time, cost, and efforts to implement a 3D system is beyond most contractors’ reach.  This paper, on the other 
hand, presents a more affordable and attainable approach to improve construction scheduling practices, through 
the utilization of Adobe
®
 Flash
®
. 
The objectives of the research include the following: 
1. Develop a prototype scheduling system involving Adobe Flash 
2. Develop a Standard Operation Procedure for creating animated schedule 
3. Create tools to enhance system capabilities 
4. Demonstrate the usability of the prototype system with a case study 
5. Verify the efficiency of the prototype system by estimating time required for animated schedule creation 
2 3D Applications in Construction Planning 
3-D modelling as a graphical representation method is closer to the representation of the physical reality of a 
structure than 2D plans, and can in principle provide a better understanding of the aspects of a project that 
depend on spatial constraints.  4D CAD is a relatively recent technology.  Linking 3D digital models with 
construction activities is called 4D CAD (space + time), and 4D technology is intended to be used by planners, 
designers, and engineers to analyze and visualize many aspects of a construction project, from design related 
considerations, to the sequence of construction, to the relationships among schedule, cost and resource 
availability data. In essence 4D can assist designers and planners in developing realistic and practical 
schedules and estimates (McKinney et al. 1998). 
Retik et al. (1990) investigated the potential application of computer graphics to construction scheduling and 
outlined the required features of the tool.  McKinney et al. (1996) developed a 4D-CAD tool, which provides 
visual and communicative usage on construction design.  Collier and Fischer (1996) used 4D modelling to 
schedule a hospital project. Williams (1996) utilized a 4D-Planner to represent to enhance project visualization, 
simulation, and communication. Adjei-Kumi and Retik (1997) reported a 4D model (PROVISYS) for planning and 
visualizing the construction plan. McKinney and Fischer (1998) presented and evaluated a 4D application by 
integrating several commercial software including AutoCAD, Primavera, Jacobus Simulation Toolkit and Walkthru.  
McKinney et al. (1998) delineated a construction example to illustrate how 4D-CAD models can help identify 
construction problems. Kamat and Martinez (2001) described a general purpose 3D visualization system on 
construction operations. 
As academic research moved on, the usefulness of visual 4D models has been tested in planning the 
construction of various large scale public and commercial projects around the world, (Koo et al., 2000; Luiten 
G., Tolman and Fischer, 1998; Luiten.and Fischer, 1998).  (Kanagasabapathi, and Ananthanarayanan, 2004)

clip instances. 
Since a construction schedule constitutes of various construction activities, the research designates the 
key construction activities in the schedule as movie clip symbols, and can be placed in an animation which 
represent the entire construction schedule.  Construction schedulers have to make one movie clip symbol for 
each key activity.  These movie clip symbols of construction activities are reusable for alternative 
construction schedule creation, or construction schedule modification, and updating. 
 
 The process to produce an animated construction schedule is as follows, as illustrated in Figure 1. 
1. Designing activity symbols – The objective of this step is to develop the movie clip symbol for each 
activity.  In this research, CAD drawings of building elevation are first obtained to initiate the process.  
Graphical elements representing the final product of each construction activity are extracted from the 
CAD files and convert into the symbol.  To illustrate construction details of the activity, animators can 
make more drawings detailing the mechanism to complete the activity.  Animators have to make symbols 
for all activities, stored them in the same library, and name the symbols after the activity.  Tweening is 
applied in the symbol to represent the progressive modes of each activity. 
2. Acquiring activity schedule – The objective of this step is to determine the duration of each activity, and 
its start and end keyframes.  This data is derived directly from MS Project file. 
3. Generating animation – To generate an animated construction schedule (which is called a “scene”), the 
animators have to follow the following steps:  
(1) Add a layer in the Timeline.  Each activity is placed in a different layer so that it can be manipulated 
separately. 
(2) Place the activity symbol in the scene.  In the Timeline, select the layer and keyframe where the 
activity is to start, which is derived from previous stage.  Adjust the Timeline according to activity 
duration.  Check if the end keyframe comply with the activity finish date. 
(3) Retain the activity symbol.  Since Flash defaults that when Timeline passes the end keyframe, the 
symbol shall disappear from the scene.  An Action script code is added to the layer to retain the 
symbol representing the completion of the construction activity. 
(4) Pause the animation.  To avoid the animation to repeat its playing, An Action script code is added to 
the scene to pause the animation after one play. 
4. Attaching schedule monitoring interface  – To further enhance the usability of the animated schedule, the 
research team has added several schedule monitoring functions to each schedule, including: 
(1) Animation Control Buttons: A set of buttons, including “play”, “pause”, “stop”, “fast forward”, and 
“rewind”, is added to the scene enhancing interactivity when playing animation. 
(2) Schedule Date Display: A small window displaying time elapse is added to the scene. 
(3) Schedule Monitor by Date: The animation allows the users to go to a specific date of the schedule, and 
also allow to play from start to the appointed date.  
(4) Schedule Comparison: A special Action Script code is added to the scene to make simultaneous 
playing of two different schedules possible.  The function allows the planners to compare two 
different alternatives.
