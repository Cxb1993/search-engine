OLED with the QWS microcavity can only resonant at one particular wavelength and produce a color
found along the upper perimeter of the color space in the CIE chromaticity diagram (see Fig. 9 for ex-
ample). In order to have any color, including white, the microcavity must be able to resonant at multiple
wavelengths. Then, OLED with such microcavity can produce an arbitrary desired chromaticity, in spite of
its original color.
1.2 Design and simulation
Based on our previous works [11–13], we design a thin film microcavity which consists of a dielectric film
stack mirror with higher order to form the distributed Bragg reflector. By higher order it means that each
layer of dielectric can be greater multiple of quarter of some reference wavelength λ0.
The DBR is deployed in a typical green OLED device which consists of the cathode / organic layers /
transparent anode / glass substrate. The DBR layers are inserted between the substrate and the anode. The
choice of the typical green OLED rather than WOLED is for the proof of the concept showing the capability
of the microcavity of the higher order.
Figure 1 illustrates the schematics of the devices. The subject of the study is shown in Fig. 1a. For
comparison, a well-studied device structure with the identical OLED layers but with different type of DBR
(using QWS) is shown in Fig. 1b.

A typical QWS consists of the following components: the dielectric layers of the alternative low (L)
and high (H) refractive indices SiO2 (nL = 1.46), and Ta2O5 (nH = 2.15). The optical thickness of each
layer in the stack is chosen to be a quarter of the desired wavelength mλ0/4, m = 1, λ0 = 520 nm. That
is, d1 = λ0/4n1, d2 = λ0/4n2. The resultant dielectric stack has high reflectance around λ0 and can act as
a mirror. The QWS contains more pairs of L and H has better mirror performance: higher reflectance and
wider bandwidth.

where the reflectance of the metal (cathode) and the dielectric stack mirrors is denoted as Rm and Rd(λ),
respectively, the effective distance between exciton-forming area and the metal mirror as Lx, the free space
electroluminescence intensity at λ without microcavity as |Enc(λ)|2. The optical length Lt of the microcav-

where the first term is due to the phase change φd at the reflection by the dielectric stack mirror, the second
term due to the optical length of the layers inside the cavity, and the third term due to the reflection phase
change φm by the metal cathode mirror.
However, this approach cannot properly handle the OLED configuration in which multiple layers of
different materials exist between the mirrors. In fact, all of them are simply layers of different materials;
there is no physical boundaries of mirror / cavity / mirror, as the Fabry–Pe´rot cavity model implies. In
order to simulate the emission properties of the OLED with microcavity, we adopt the multilayer matrix
method [15].
The electric fieldE(x) has a right-traveling wave and a left-traveling wave components. It can be written
as
E(x) = Right e−ikxx + Left e+ikxx ≡ A(x) +B(x). (3)

To get the output E field at the substrate , we can solve the linear equations (12) , (13), and (14) for A′s.
The source terms GA and GB can be obtained by taking the square root of the output intensity of an
OLED without microcavity structure.
2 RESULTS
Using the output intensity spectrum obtained from a bared OLED without microcavity structure, as
shown as the dotted curve in Fig. 8, we simulate the emission spectrum from the devices with QWS micro-
cavity and higher-order microcavity, respectively. The results are shown as the solid curves and the dashed
curve in Fig. 8.
In order to quantify the modification made by the microcavity in the chromaticity, we compute the
CIE x, y coordinates of the simulated OLED with microcavity from the calculated intensity spectrum. The
tristimulus values X,Y, Z are given by the following equation [19]:
X =
∫ 780 nm
380 nm
P (λ) x¯(λ)dλ, Y =
∫ 780 nm
380 nm
P (λ) y¯(λ)dλ, Z =
∫ 780 nm
380 nm
P (λ) z¯(λ)dλ (15)
where the intensity spectrum of the light source is denoted as P (λ), the color matching functions of
CIE 1931 2◦ standard as x¯(λ), y¯(λ), z¯(λ). Then, the CIE x, y coordinates are obtained by the following
equation:
x =
X
X + Y + Z
, y =
Y
X + Y + Z
(16)
The chromaticity from the original, the microcavity with QWS, and the microcavity with higher-order
are marked in the CIE chromaticity diagram shown in Fig. 9.
2.1 Discussion
The optical length of the cavity varies significantly as the wavelength changes, due to the reflection phase
change of the dielectric stack mirror. Therefore, we can manipulate the resonance wavelength by introduc-
ing phase change in the reflection of the dielectric stack mirror.
When resonance occurs, a standing wave exists in the cavity. The emission intensity peak strength
will be greatly enhanced, if the exciton dipole location coincides with one of the antinode of the standing
wave. However, because of the layer configuration asymmetry around the EML layer, this is difficult to
achieve. It is why the resonant peak is only slightly better than the bared OLED output at the corresponding
wavelength.
Nonetheless, We have demonstrated that a green OLED with a microcavity structure can be enhanced
in its chromaticity. In particular, we can move the CIE x, y of the original spectrum to a new location, i.e.,
a different color. In fact, the microcavity of higher order device has a nearly pure white-light emission from
a typical green OLED. The design will surely open the possibility to lead to high chromatic performance
devices.

ABSTRACT
There have been many researches regarding to the organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with microcavity structures, in
order to enhance its output optical properties such as chromaticity and intensity. In the applications to the white-light
OLED (WOLED) and full color displays, the difficulty remains in the design of the optical length of the microcavity for
proper resonance. A typical microcavity structure consists of the dielectric quarter wave stacks (QWS) as a distributed
Bragg reflector (DBR) and the metal cathode to form a pair of mirrors. The organic and other material layers between the
mirrors plays the role of the cavity. It can only have one major resonance peak in the perpendicular view angle and degrade
the broad spectrum nature of the WOLED. Our study proposes the use of non-QWS mirror using thicker and higher-order
(greater integral multiple of the quarter wavelength) of the dielectric layers. We can have the multiple resonance peak
wavelengths to meet the WOLED requirement by introducing the reflection phase change of the dielectric stack mirror
at certain wavelengths. The proposed microcavity structure yields a desired shift to the white point in CIE chromaticity
for a typical green OLED. One of the potential applications of the microcavity with non-QWS mirror can be to make the
WOLED even closer to the CIE white point without worrying the doping process variation, which is a typical problem in
the WOLED. It greatly enhances the usability of the WOLED in various applications.
Keywords: organic light emitting diode, thin filmmicrocavity, non-quarter wave stack, distributed Bragg reflector, multiple-
resonance, dielectric stack mirror, chromaticity enhancement.
1. INTRODUCTION
The invention of the organic electroluminescent diodes in 1987 by C.W. Tang and S. A.Van Slyke marked the beginning of
the OLED era.1 Many researches since then have been carried out to improve the performance and efficiency of the new
luminescent organic molecules and devices.2–4 Among them the emission properties modification of the organic materials
by the microcavity has been shown as an effective way to enhance luminance and tune color.5–7 The optical microcavity
structure had successfully been applied to the semiconductor light emitting diode/laser. The idea is not new. Back in
1966, A. F. Turner and P.W.Baumeister discussed the design of highly reflecting mirrors composed of multilayer stacks
of dielectric films.8 This kind of mirror is called a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR), defined as mirror structures based
on Bragg reflection at a period structure.9 It is a structure consisting of an alternating sequence of layers of two different
optical materials.
However, the design of the microcavity’s optical length for the white-light OLED (WOLED) is challenging, because
the requirement of the broad spectrum of the WOLED conflicts with the narrow resonance spectrum of the microcavity
with QWS. Generally, the typical mechanism of a WOLED is to mix organic materials which can emit different colors.7, 10
It is possible to make the emitted light appear to be white, if the individual colors are at the appropriate points on the
chromaticity diagram. Nevertheless, it is not straight forward to find the right way to generate pure white by means of the
organic material mixture.
OLED with the QWS microcavity can only resonant at one particular wavelength and produce a color found along the
upper perimeter of the color space in the CIE chromaticity diagram (see Fig. 9 for example). In order to have any color,
including white, the microcavity must be able to resonant at multiple wavelengths. Then, OLED with such microcavity
can produce an arbitrary desired chromaticity, in spite of its original color.

Figure 3. The spectrum of the reflection phase change (from the
cavity to the DBR) of two types of DBR’s.
The DBR and the cathode metal form a pair of mirrors. The organic and other material layers between the mirrors plays
the role of the cavity. If the optical length between the two mirrors satisfies the Fabry–Pe´rot cavity resonance condition
at λP, then the OLED emission intensity spectrum will have a sharp peak around λP. The peak’s wavelength λP is not
necessarily equal to the reference wavelength λ0 of the QWS. However, λP will be located within the high reflectance
spectrum band of the mirrors. Because DBR usually has a quite wide band of high reflectance in the spectrum, the
resonance peak λP can be tuned by adjusting the cavity optical length.16
The organic materials used in OLED devices usually exhibits characteristics of non-zero extinction coefficient k. There-
fore, the Q-factor of the microcavity is degraded because of the lossy cavity materials. Also, the organic materials have
dispersion (wavelength dependency of the index of refraction) which cannot be ignored. To properly incorporate the ef-
fect of the loss and dispersion, the optical parameters n and k of the organic materials are measured. Then, those optical
parameters are used in our simulation. The measured parameters of two organic materials are shown here: andtris(8-
hydroxy)quinolato aluminum, or Alq3 in Fig. 4, and N,N’-diphenyl-N,N’-bis(3-methyl-phenyl)-l,l’biphenyl-4,4’diamine,

The source terms GA and GB can be obtained by taking the square root of the output intensity of an OLED without
microcavity structure.
3. RESULTS
Using the output intensity spectrum obtained from a bared OLED without microcavity structure, as shown as the dotted
curve in Fig. 8, we simulate the emission spectrum from the devices with QWS microcavity and higher-order microcavity,
respectively. The results are shown as the solid curves and the dashed curve in Fig. 8.
In order to quantify the modification made by the microcavity in the chromaticity, we compute the CIE x, y coordinates
of the simulated OLED with microcavity from the calculated intensity spectrum. The tristimulus values X,Y,Z are given
by the following equation:19

4. DISCUSSION
The optical length of the cavity varies significantly as the wavelength changes, due to the reflection phase change of
the dielectric stack mirror. Therefore, we can manipulate the resonance wavelength by introducing phase change in the
reflection of the dielectric stack mirror.
When resonance occurs, a standing wave exists in the cavity. The emission intensity peak strength will be greatly
enhanced, if the exciton dipole location coincides with one of the antinode of the standing wave. However, because of the
layer configuration asymmetry around the EML layer, this is difficult to achieve. It is why the resonant peak is only slightly
better than the bared OLED output at the corresponding wavelength.
Nonetheless, We have demonstrated that a green OLED with a microcavity structure can be enhanced in its chromatic-
ity. In particular, we can move the CIE x, y of the original spectrum to a new location, i.e., a different color. In fact, the
microcavity of higher order device has a nearly pure white-light emission from a typical green OLED. The design will
surely open the possibility to lead to high chromatic performance devices.
