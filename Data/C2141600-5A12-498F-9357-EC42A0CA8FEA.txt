貳、研究目的 
In this project, an instance of the subset-sum problem can be implemented by our 
proposed quantum algorithm. By using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique, 
we perform an NMR experiment for the simplest subset-sum problem to test our 
theory. 
 
參、文獻探討 
From [1], it was proved that there is an efficient universal quantum Turing machine. But quantum 
Turing machines could not solve all the NP-complete problems [2]. Quantum query lower bounds for 
the Hamiltonian circuit, the dominating set and the traveling salesman problem were presented in [3]. 
Other important works regarding quantum algorithms to solve computational problems include the 
original version of the quantum Fourier transformation [4]. 
肆、研究方法 
A. Definition of the Subset-sum Problem 
Assume that a finite set A is {a1, …, am}, where ak is the k
th
 element for 1 ≤ k ≤ m. 
Definition 4−1 is applied to denote the subset-sum problem for any a finite set, A. 
Definition 4−1: The subset-sum problem for an m-element finite set, A, is to find a 
subset A
1
 ⊆ A such that the sum of every element in A1 is exactly b, where b is any 
given positive integer. 
B. Computational State Space of Quantum Solutions for the Subset-sum Problem 
An arbitrary state ϕ  of a quantum bit is nothing else than a linearly weighted 
combination of the following computational basis vectors (4.1): ϕ  = l1 ⋅ 0  + l2 ⋅ 
1  = l1 ⋅

( 000 111 ) / 2+  which means the three qubits are entangled. As the readout 
by NMR is a weak measurement, we have no state collapse after the measurement. 
Besides, only single quantum coherence can be detected in NMR. As a result, we have 
to employ some additional operations to disentangle them for detecting the output 
state 
123 123
( 000 111 ) / 2+ . For this end, we apply a CNOT gate on the second 
and first qubits to get the state 
123 123
( 000 011 ) / 2+ . The second qubit is control 
quibte and the first qubit is the target qubit. Then the first qubit can be read out by a s 
ingle / 2π  pulse along the x-axis, as shown in Figure 6-1 (a). Similar steps applied 
to the second and third quits, respectively, result in the spectrum in Figure 6-1 (b) and 
Figure 6-1 (c). It’s evident that the experimental results are in good agreement with 
our theoretical prediction.

柒、計畫成果自評 
We have investigated the availability of quantum implementation for an instance of 
the subset-sum problem with a finite set involving m elements of n bits. We have also 
estimate the complexity of our solution and carried out an experiment by NMR 
technology for a simplest example.

quantum bits to be 0. Moreover, the notations used in Algorithm 4-2 below have been denoted in previous subsections. The first 
parameter w in Algorithm 4-2 is used to represent the maximum size of vertices among legal answers, and its value is passed 
from the execution of Step (1a) in Algorithm 4-3 in next subsection. To increase the probability of success on measuring the 
answer from among 2n choices, Grover’s algorithm [Grover 1996] is integrated into the proposed quantum algorithm and is 
applied to significantly increase the amplitudes of those answers. Grover’s operator is diffusion transform G, which is defined by 
matrix G as follows: Gi, j = (
n2

) if i  j and Gi, i = (1+
n2

II. AN EXAMPLE OF THREE-QUBIT SOLUTION FOR THE CLIQUE PROBLEM 
We attempt to test our theory by means of the NMR technique. As with the current technique, the coherent operation using the 
spatial average approach is only available with three quantum bits, we have to restrict ourselves in the simplest case of the clique 
problem for a graph G = {V, E}, where V is {v1} and E is {(v1, v1)}. Because the number of vertices in {v1} is one, the number 
of edges in {(v1, v1)} is also one, and there is no edge in its complementary graph, the value of n is equal to one, the value of  
is also equal to one, and the value of m is zero. This is to say that the maximum clique is in fact equal to {v1}. Therefore, Figure 
6-1 is the corresponding quantum circuit for the reduced version of Algorithm 4-3 that is to find the answer of the simplest clique 
problem to the graph  
 
Figure 6-1: The corresponding quantum circuit of the example above 
 
G with {v1} (its vertex) and {(v1, v1)} (its edge). In Figure 6-1, the initial state of solving the simplest case is set to 
0
1 ,1z  
1
0c  
.01x  From Figure 6-1, the Hadamard gate is applied to encode two possible cliques (choices):  and {v1}. In Figure 6-1, 
the CCNOT gate is employed to check whether  and {v1} are legal cliques or not and to figure out the number of vertices for 
each legal choice. Since in Figure 6-1, it consists of one quantum bit and two auxiliary quantum bits, it does not need Grover’s 
operator to increase the amplitude of the answer, and those reversible quantum operations are also unnecessary. 
 
Our experiment is completed on a Varian INOVA 600 NMR spectrometer. The sample is 
13C labelled  alanine with 
formula 
13 13 13
1 3 2 2 3( )CH CH NH COOH  , where the three carbons

respectively. The J-coupling constants are 12 23 13
34.79 , 54.01 , 1.20J Hz J Hz J Hz    
. Soft pulses are used to achieve the 
selective excitation. The experiment has three main steps as follows. Then the first qubit could be read out by a single / 2  
pulse along the x-axis, as shown in Figure 6-2(a). Similar steps for the second and the third quantum bits, respectively, result in 
the spectra in Figure 6-2(b) and Figure 6-2(c). It’s evident that the experimental results are in good agreement with our 
theoretical prediction.

Abstract—In this paper, it is demonstrated that quantum implementation of bio-molecular solutions to compute the 
number of elements in each hitting-set in an instance of the hitting-set problem could be considered as the oracle work in 
Grover’s algorithm, i.e., the target state labeling, preceding Grover’s searching steps. Finally, for testing our theory, a 
three-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment of solving the simplest hitting-set problem is performed.

III. QUANTUM ALGORITHMS OF BIO-MOLECUAR OF THE HITTING-SET PROBLEM 
In this section, we will first introduce the definition of the hitting-set problem and the DNA-based algorithm for solving an 
instance of the hitting-set problem [8]. Then based on bio-molecular solutions for solving an instance of the hitting-set problem 
[8], its corresponding quantum algorithm is presented. 
 
D. DEFINITION OF THE HITTING-SET PROBLEM 
Assume that a finite set S is {un, , u1}, where ui is the i
th element in S with 1  i  n. |S| is denoted as the number of elements 
in S and |S| is equal to n. Suppose that a collection C is a set of subsets of the finite set S, denoted by {C1, , Cm}, where Cj is the 
jth element in C with 1  j  m. |C| is denoted as the number of subsets in C and |C| is equal to m. Mathematically, a hitting-set is 
to find whether there is a subset S1  S such that S1 contains at least one element from each subset in C. Definition 4-1 cited in [9] 
is applied to denote the hitting-set problem, which is an NP-complete problem [9]. 
 
Definition 4-1: The hitting-set problem with an n-element finite set S and an m-element collection C of subsets for S means 
finding a minimum-sized hitting-set. 
 
As an example, we consider a simple case in Figure 4-1, where the finite set S is {2, 1} and the collection C is {{1}}. The two 
sets define a hitting-set problem. In Figure 4-1, there are two hitting sets that are, respectively, {1} and {1, 2}. From Definition 
4-1, the answer (a minimum-sized hitting-set) of the hitting-set problem for S and C in Figure 4-1 is {1}. 
 
S = {2, 1} and C = {{1}}

E. QUANTUM ALGORITHMS FOR CALCULATING THE NUMBER OF ONES TO LEGAL HITTING SETS 
The following quantum algorithm is proposed to work on the physical quantum computer proposed by Deutsch [6] and is 
applied to figure out the number of ones to legal hitting sets in the hitting-set problem with an n-element finite set S and an 
m-subset collection C. For convenience of presentation, it is supposed that ,1qu  ,

reversing the operations from Steps (4a) to (2).
