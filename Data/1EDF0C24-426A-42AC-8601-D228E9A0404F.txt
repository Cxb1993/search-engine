2.1 Problem formulation 
In this project, a simple test stage for 
the optimization of the hysteretic model of a 
pantograph mechanism is developed as 
shown in Fig. 1-1~1-3. The working range 
of the displacement is about 15μm. The 
resolution of the Capacitance sensor is less 
than 5nm. An example of a hysteresis loop 
generated with this stage is shown in Fig. 1-
1 with the application of a voltage signal 
)sin(1530)( ttW += . The main goal in this 
project is to develop an approach such that 
the behavior of such hysteretic systems can 
be well modeled and further predictable. 
The precise measurement is the essential 
condition of this work. Based on Banning et 
al., the following differential model is used 
to describe the dynamics of hysteresis:  
)()()()()()( tWbtWtWatWtHtH &&&& ⋅+⋅⋅⋅+⋅⋅−= αα   (2-1) 
where )(tH  and  )(tW  are the position 
response and  applied voltage, respectively. 
+∈ Rba,,α  are parameters to be determined. 
In the study of Banning et al., the authors 
execute a series of experiments for 
determining the parameters of ba,,α . 
However, this approach might lose precision 
due to the accumulated tolerances in 
measurement of experiment data and 
sometimes it needs much time for executing 
the series experiments. Thus, to improve the 
accuracy of the differential model (2-1), we 
shall develop a new tuning method for the 
parameters ba,,α  based on EP algorithm. 
Before proceeding to our main results, we 
first define the estimated error as 
)()( exp kTHkTHek −=   (2-3) 
where T is the period of sample time. )(kTH  
is the simulated displacement at time kT by 
using (2-1) under applied voltage )(tW , 
while )(exp kTH  is the measured 
displacement of the experiment stage under 
the same )(tW  
 
2.2 Solving the optimization problem via 
evolutionary programming (EP) 
algorithm 
 
 In this section, an extended EP 
algorithm is proposed to obtain the 
differential model of hysteretic system with 
optimal parameters to minimize the 
following objective function (OF) score 
∑

Let g be the continuously differentiable 
matrix-valued function defined for Sg∈ , 
where }3,2,1,0{
3 =≤≤∈= iMgRgS ii , iM  is 
the searching space and is bounded. The 
optimization problem involves finding 
Sbag ∈= ],,[* ***α  such that the OF 
performance index of the system is 
minimized.  More accurately, the 
optimization problem (P1) is stated 
mathematically as 
(P1):    To find Sg ∈*  such that

extended EP algorithm for solving the above 
optimization problem is described as follows:

Firstly, the switching surface is defined as  
∫ +−= t dECBKCACEs  0 )()( ττ ,      (4-6) 
where 21, ×∈ RKC are selected to 
satisfy ,0≠CB 0)(max <+ BKAλ . It is 
known [16-17] that as long as the system 
operates in the sliding mode, it satisfies the 
equations 
 0)( and 0)( == tsts& .       (4-7) 
Therefore, the equivalent control eqF  in 
the sliding manifold can be obtained. By 
differentiating (4-7) with respect to time and 
substituting from (11), then

According to [5], the creep motion will 
finally vanish if the applied force is not 
monotonic increasing or decreasing. Such 
property could conclude that the controlled 
system will enter the hardened phase, i.e. the 
uncertain will turn into matching condition and 
can be total rejected by the adaptive sliding 
mode control. 
Once a proper switching surface has been 
selected with an appropriate matrices C and K, 
it should do next is to design an adaptive 
variable structure controller, which is not only 
derive the system trajectories onto the sliding 
surface but also remove the limitation value of 
the knowing uncertainties in advance.  
Before proceeding to the adaptive sliding 
mode control design, the Barbalat lemma is 
provided: 
Lemma 1 (Barbalat lemma)[18]: If 
RRw →:~  is a uniformly continuous function 
for 0≥t  and if the limit of the integral 
λλ dwt

∫→∞
 
0 )(
~lim     
exists and is finite, then 
0)(~lim =∞→ twt           (4-11) 
To ensure the occurrence of the sliding 
motion in static friction region, an adaptive 
variable structure control is proposed as 
1);()](ˆ[)( 1 >+−= − ηβη ssigntCBKECBF    (4-12) 
The adaptive law is

where 0βˆ  is the bounded positive initial 
value of )(ˆ tβ . The adaptive law can be also 
rewritten in the integral form as 
ττξββ dst t∫+= − 0 10 )(ˆ)(ˆ .         (4-14) 
In the following, the proposed adaptive 
scheme (4-13~4-14) will be proved to be able 
to derive the uncertain system (4-2) in the 
static friction region onto the sliding

force is saturated when Ntu 200≥ . The 
simulation results with reference command mμ6 , 
mm1  and 10cm with controller parameters in 
Table 4-3 are shown in Figures 4-1~4-2. It can be 
seen that the pantograph mechanisms is regulated 
to the reference command successfully about in 1 
second, without respect to short range ( mμ6 ), or 
long range (1mm).
