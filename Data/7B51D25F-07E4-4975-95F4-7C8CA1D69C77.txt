Abstract 
Due to the increases in the prices of oil and raw materials, the vendor always announces an 
impending supply price increase at a certain time in the future and allows the buyer to have one 
opportunity to replenish with the present price before the rise in supply price. On the other hand, the 
buyer will reflect the face that supply price increases on retail price when market demand depends 
on retail price at this time. Hence, this study investigates the supply chain inventory problems when 
the price of raw material fluctuates and market demand rate depends on retail price. The purpose of 
this study will be to determine the optimal special order and production policies and retail price by 
maximizing the increment of total joint profit. Furthermore, due to the vendor may or not provide 
all the special order quantity at the buyer’s next replenishment date and hence the shortage will or 
not occur, two specific situations are discussed in this study. In theoretical analysis, the necessary 
and sufficient conditions of the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solutions will be shown. 
Finally, several numerical examples will be presented to demonstrate the developed model and 
solution procedure, and sensitivity analyses of the optimal solutions with respect to major 
parameters will be also carried out to provide manager a useful decision consultation.

and examined a model for a single-vendor-single-buyer production inventory system. Furthermore, 
Lu (1995) relaxed Goyal’s assumption of a single vendor-single-buyer and proposed a model in 
which the vendor could actually supply the purchaser in a number of equal smaller lot-sizes, even 
before completing the entire lot. Hahm and Yano (1992) and Aderohunmu et al. (1995) developed 
an integrated model to minimize the total relevant inventory cost for both the vendor and the buyer, 
which included transportation costs. Goyal (1995) also allowed the first shipment to be made before 
the whole lot was produced, and proposed a policy in which the quantity delivered to the buyer was 
not identical every replenishment. Later, Hill (1997) took into consideration the geometric growth 
factor which is a decision variable and suggested a method based on an exhaustive search for both 
the growth factor and the number of shipments within certain ranges. Further literature in support of 
this includes Jamal and Sarker (1993), Banerjee and Kim (1995), Sarker and Khan (1999, 2003), 
and Khan and Sarker (2002), Wu and Ouyang (2003), Hill and Omar (2006) and Lin (2009).  
Nevertheless, a weakness in above inventory models is that they neglect the deterioration of 
goods, a common phenomenon. It is well known that certain products, such as medicine, volatile 
liquids, fruits, and vegetables, will vaporize, spoil, or damage over time. For such products, losses 
due to deterioration cannot be ignored when determining the optimal ordering policy. Inventory 
problems relating to deteriorating items have been studied widely, for example Ghare and Schrader 
(1963) were the first to establish an EOQ model for an exponentially-decaying item, for which there 
is constant demand. Later, Covert and Philip (1973) extended this model and obtained an EOQ 
model for a variable deterioration rate, by assuming a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Philip 
(1974) then developed an inventory model with a three-parameter Weibull distribution deterioration 
rate. Shah (1977) extended Philip’s model and considered the circumstances in which a shortage is 
allowed. Goyal and Giri (2001) provided a detailed review of the deteriorating inventory literature 
since the early 1990s. Bakker et al. (2012) have recently undertaken an up-to-date review of the 
advances made in the field of inventory control of perishable items (deteriorating inventory) since 
2001. There is a vast amount of literature on deteriorating items, an outline of which can be found 
by reviewing Moon et al. (2005), Deng et al. (2007), Mishra and Shah (2008) and others. 
Consequently, the contribution of this paper, relative to previous studies, is that we explore 
inventory decisions in the context of the following three issues in regards to the traditional EOQ 
model: (1) when the buyer is informed by the vendor of a future price increase and decides whether 
to make a special order before the increase, and what their new retail price should be; and (2) the 
goods deteriorate at a constant rate. Furthermore, due to the vendor may or not provide all the 
special order quantity at the buyer’s next replenishment date and hence the shortage will or not 
occur, two specific situations are discussed in this study. In theoretical analysis, the necessary and 
sufficient conditions of the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solutions will be shown. Finally, 
several numerical examples will be presented to demonstrate the developed model and solution 
procedure, and sensitivity analyses of the optimal solutions with respect to major parameters will be 
also carried out to provide manager a useful decision consultation.

Assumptions 
(1) There is single-vendor and single-buyer for a single product in this model. 
(2) The vendor’s deliver policy is lot-for-lot in each production run. 
(3) For the vendor, shortages are not allowed whether the buyer makes a general or special order. 
For the buyer, shortages are allowed when making a special order. 
(4) When shortages occur, the unsatisfied demand is complete backlogged. 
(5)When the material price increases, the vendor will reflect it on the supply price (i.e., the buyer’s 
purchase cost). In turn, the buyer will also reflect its purchase cost on the retail price.  
(6) The demand rate )( pD  is a non-negative continuous function of the retail price p , and 
satisfies 0)(' pD  and 0)('' pD . 
(7) In general, the special order quantity at the present price, sQ , is always greater than or equal to 
the optimal economic order quantity before the purchasing price increase, Q*, i.e., QsQ*. 
(8) There is no replacement or repair of deteriorated units during the period of the consideration. 
(9) The replenishment is instantaneous and the lead time is zero. 
 
3. Model formulation 
The integrated inventory system evolves as follows. Before price increase, the buyer orders Q 
units per order and the vendor delivers q units to the buyer in each shipment. As the vendor 
announces an impending supply price increase at a certain time in the future and allows the buyer to 
have one opportunity to replenish with the present price before the rise in supply price. At the same 
time, the buyer reflects the face that supply price increases on retail price when market demand 
depends on retail price. Once the buyer and vendor have built up a long-term strategic partnership, 
they can jointly determine the best policy for both parties. Following, we first establish the joint 
total profit per unit time before price increase. An then the joint profit increase between the special 
order /production and regular order/production during the special cycle time is developed.  
 
3.1 The buyer’s total profit per unit time 
The depletion of the inventory occurs due to the combined effects of demand and physical 
deterioration. Hence, the change in inventory level before the purchasing price increase can be 
illustrated by the following differential equation:

3.3 The joint total profit per unit time  
Once the buyer and vendor have built up a long-term strategic partnership, they can jointly 
determine the best policy for both parties. Accordingly, the joint total profit per unit time can be 
obtained as the sum of the buyer’s and the vendor’s total profits per unit time. That is,

The objective of this problem is to determine the optimal pricing, ordering and production 
policies that correspond to maximizing the joint total profit per unit time. The optimal solutions can 
be obtained by using the following search procedure: We first prove that for any given retail price p, 
the optimal value of T  not only exists but also is unique. And then for any given value of T , there 
exists a unique sell pricing p to maximize the objective function. The processes of proofs are similar 
to Dye (2007), Wu et al. (2009), Yang et al. (2009), and hence are omitted here. Once the optimal 
retail price, *p , and the length of replenishment cycle time, *T , are obtained, the length of 
production cycle time, *vT , and the optimal order quantity, *Q , are given as follows:

4. Conclusions and future research 
In this paper, we investigate the supply chain inventory problem when the price of raw 
material fluctuates and market demand rate depends on retail price. From the point of view of the 
vendor, he/she will determine the optimal production and pricing policies as the fluctuation in the 
price of raw material influences his/her production cost which will be reflected on supply price (the 
buyer’s purchase cost) and allow the buyer to make a special order. From the buyer's viewpoint, the 
buyer will adopt a special order policy to determine the optimal special order quantities and retail 
price when market demand rate depends on retail price. In theoretical analysis, the necessary and 
sufficient conditions of the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solutions under various 
situations will be shown and several useful theorems will also be developed. Further, several 
numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the developed models and solution procedures, 
and sensitivity analyses of the optimal solutions with respect to major parameters will be also 
carried out. 
The proposed model can be extended in several ways. For example, it is usually observed in 
the supermarket that display of the consumer goods in large quantities attracts more customers and 
generates higher demand. Hence, the proposed inventory model may deal with the demand rate as a 
function of the on-hand inventory. Furthermore, time value of money is not considered in this study. 
In the future, we hope the model can also be generalized to take time value of money into account.

This research corresponds to the original plan and has attained its aim. Hence, the study is of 
great academic value and suitable for publication in academic journals.
