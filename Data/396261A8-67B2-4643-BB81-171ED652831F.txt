Formulae (1.1) through (1.3) clearly show that there are ( 2)n k  segments on the B-spline.
Based on the definition of the B-spline, the two ending knots, 0t and n kt  , do not influence the
shape of the B-spline. Their functions are limited to constructing the blending function; thus they
can be regarded as the auxiliary knots. Therefore for any knot sequence, such as
0 1 1 1{ , , , , , , }n n n k n kt t t t t t    , the equivalent knot in constructing the same curve will be
1 1 2 3 1 1 1{ 1, , , , , , , , , 1}n n n k n kt t t t t t t t     . Here the first knot 0t is replaced by the second knot
subtracts 1; and the last knot n kt  is substituted by the last second knot pluses 1. The
transformation from ordinary knot sequence to its equivalent form makes the condition n kt t 
impossible, the basis function is reduced to its simple form as

1.2.2 Blossoming Algorithm
Lyle Ramshaw [11] developed the blossoming as a popular method for constructing the B-spline.
We link the concept of blossoming with the Cox and De-Boor algorithm and use the identical
notation on the degree, knot sequence and control points so that those who are familiar with the
Cox and De-Boor algorithm can easily adapt the blossoming algorithm. The following notations
are adopted from [6].
Suppose that we want to construct a B-spline of degree 1k with control points
, 0,1, ,iP i n  by the blossoming approach. The knot sequence is 1 2 1{ , , , }n kt t t  and the
effective knot interval is 1 1[ , , , ]k k nt t t  . For each segment of B-spline we need 2( 1)k knots
to perform the construction of the curve. Since there are ( 2)n k  segments on the B-spline
with effective knots as 1 1[ , ]k nt t  , we can construct the B-spline segment by segment. Assume
one is working on the construction of the segment interval 1[ , ]I It t  where I could be
1, , ,k k n  , then the corresponding control points will be 1 2, , ,I k I k IP P P   with

corresponding knots used in constructing the segment are 2 3 1[ , , , ]I k I k I kt t t   . The segment in
the curve is represented by 1 1 1( ) [ ] ( )

5Formula (2.1) illustrates that the new control points are obtained from the old ones and the first
and last new control points are identical to the original first and last control points.
Because degree reduction is the reverse process of degree elevation, one can write equation (2.1)
in matrix form and change the roles of given constant and unknown variable to obtain

One can abbreviate as
(1)AB B (2.3)
where A is a 2n by 1n matrix, the given constants are (1)B and, unknown variables are
B . Note that the empty entries in A are zeros and there is a square matrix above the dash line in
matrix A .
Equation (2.2) may have no solution, so one needs the least squares method [8] to solve this
question. But the least squares method can arrive at an approximation curve, and sometimes the
exact original curve. In addition to the drawback of getting only approximation curve in most
cases by the least squares method, the geometric meaning among the control points that renders
an exact curve by degree reduction is not clear. To clarify the geometric relationship, the
rectangular matrix A is divided into a square matrix Aˆ and a row vector so that equation (2.3)
is decomposed into two equations: one is a square matrix Aˆ of 1n with 1n unknown
control points B and given control points (1)ˆB , the other is a limiting equation (1)1n nb b  . We
denote them as

Here Aˆ is a tri-diagonal matrix. Now the question that must be considered is (1)ˆ ˆAB B , where
the objective is to solve B . One multiplies equation (2.4) with 1ˆA in both sides result in
1 (1)ˆ ˆB A B where (1)ˆB is known control points, so one shall confine attention to find 1ˆA .

Equation (2.22) states that the requirement of the original control points of Bézier curve of degree
m are suitable for degree reduction.

By the Fig. 2, one can observe that the connecting line of (1)1b and
(1)
2b is parallel to the
connecting line of (1)0b and
(1)
3b . Also, that the vector of
(1)
0b to
(1)
3b is three times the vector of
(1)
1b to
(1)
2b .
There is no further knowledge on 5m because the equation becomes complex. We suggestion,
therefore, that trying to establish the result of 5m could be the subject for future research.
3. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
Degree reduction is the reverse process of the degree elevation. Degree reduction can conserve
the memory in storing the curve. The previous works only arrive at an approximation curve with
the possibility of reaching an exact matched curve, and the conditions of the exact match are
specified by the Chebyshev polynomial approach, however nothing is mentioned on the
geometric relationship among control points of exact match. This paper presents a degree
reduction approach that specifies the condition of matching the original curve by the inverse of
tri-diagonal matrix and expresses the geometric relationship between control points. That is, the
geometric relationship from the control points before the degree reduction can be seen and one
can understand whether the curve is suitable for reduction or not.
In terms of degree reduction, we have expressed the geometric relationship between control
points, but we only explained the geometric relationship for 4m . Up to this point, there has
not been sufficient information to express the geometric relationship for , thus more research on
this is required.
