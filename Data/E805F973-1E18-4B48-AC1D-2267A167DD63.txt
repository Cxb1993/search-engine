Auditory perception of the sound with respect to a moving sound source passing by the observer was
investigated in this work. The sound pressure at the entrance of the external ear canal was calculated
by the solution of the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings equation. Furthermore, the Hilbert Huang transforma-
tion is used to ﬁnd the instantaneous frequencies of acoustic signal. Results show that the Interaural Level
Difference and the frequencies shifting are eventful cues to perceive the direction and the speed of the
moving sound source. In addition, the perceived loudness level will be larger in the motional case than
that found in the stationary cases.

1. Introduction
Sound sources, which exist throughout our daily lives, are often
in a state of motion. In order to understand the inﬂuence of moving
sound sources on a sound ﬁeld, establishment of a theoretical
method for investigating motion effects is important. To address
this need, Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings derived a governing
equation to describe the sound ﬁeld generated by a moving source
in a free ﬁeld condition [1], i.e., the so-called Ffowcs Williams–
Hawkings equation (FW–H equation). Farassat then established a
series of solutions to the FW–H equation in the form of a surface
integral [2,3], the so-called Formulation 1A [3]. Although Ffowcs
Williams and Hawkings also suggested the solution in their work,
Farassat’s solutions [2,3] were more useful for the development of
numerical procedures (e.g., Computational Fluid Dynamics or
‘‘CFD” methods). For example, these methods have been applied
to simulations of the noise generated by a vehicle, train [4,5] and
propeller [6,7]. However, most research has focused on obtaining
the acoustic sound pressure on the surface of the moving sound
source or at the ﬁeld points in the free ﬁeld condition [1–7], but
a proper method for investigating the binaural hearing caused by
a moving sound source is still needed.
Thenoisiness caused by a vibrating bodymovingwith high speed
(for instance, a high speed train) is an important environmental is-
sue. Indeed, the effects ofmoving sound sources on binaural hearing
have received much attention from researchers during recent years
[8–11]. In earlier studies, sound sources moving in a circular trajec-
tory were considered, and the method of the interpolated Head-Re-
lated Transform Function (HRTF) was suggested to account for the
effect of the motion [8,9]. However, most sources move more line-
arly, not circularly, in many real-life cases. The Doppler effect is
stronger in linear situations than that observed in cases exhibiting
circularmotion. For this reason, sound sources in linearmotionhave
been more frequently discussed in recent studies [10,11]. All of
these studies assume, however, that the moving sound source is a
simple point source. In general, a volume monopole source can be
seen as a point source in the far ﬁeld. Its acoustic performance is
equivalent to that of a pulsating sphere in stationary cases [12],
but it ismarkedly different from that of a pulsating sphere inmoving
cases, even in the far ﬁeld [13]. Thus, a moving point source is an
overly simple model and, as such, its application is restricted.
As mentioned, noisiness caused by a moving source (for in-
stance, the noise caused by an object passing by) is always an
important environmental issue. Additionally, the cues used to de-
tect the moving speed of an object are also of interest. This is very
important in virtual reality (for instance, in the development of a
3D sound system for entertainment purposes). In the past, the
Doppler effect has been the only important factor in simulating this
motion effect. Although Kaczmarek [10] has carefully studied cues
used to detect the velocity of a moving body, the model used in [10]
is too simple, i.e., it is based on the theoretical foundation of a mov-
ing point source. As a result, the rate of change in sound pressure
with respect to time (deﬁned as the overall level difference in
[10]) and the frequency shift (i.e., the Doppler effect) are the only
two major factors used to detect the speed of a moving body.
In this article, a new Boundary Element Method (BEM) was
developed to simulate the sound pressure at the entrance of the
external ear canal. The BEM was carried out in the time domain
and was based on numerical implementation of Formulation 1A
[3]. It should again be emphasised that the BEM has never been
previously used to numerically implement Formulation 1A. The
BEM presented here yields better computing efﬁciency than other
numerical methods (e.g., the CFD method), especially when used to

4. Numerical implementation of the integral formula
To make predictions for acoustic pressure using Eq. (5), the
Boundary Element Method (BEM) is applied in order to implement
the numerical calculation. However, in order to obtain the informa-
tion speciﬁed on the surface of the bodies, one should let xO
*
ap-
proach the surface SðyS
* Þ. Nevertheless, this process will produce a
singular integral, or so-called improper integral, when xO
*
is collo-
cated on SðyS
* Þ. Before dealing with these improper integrals, the
singular point must ﬁrst be excluded from Eq. (5). Consequently,
a modiﬁed coefﬁcient CðxÞO
*
; tÞ is introduced no the left-hand side
of Eq. (5) to account for the effect of the singular point integration.
Thus, Eq. (5) is modiﬁed as [4]:

After deﬁning the modiﬁed coefﬁcient CðxO

for discretisation. The integration is performed on the discretised

Regarding the spatial approximation of Eq. (12), the point re-
lates to pOk can be placed at each of node i varying from 1 to nn
on the boundary successively. This procedure is a so-called ‘‘collec-
tion.” The concept is the same in temporal approximations. The
next step is to establish a system of equations such that the system
matrix of unknowns can be obtained using linear-algebraic tech-
niques. By assembling of all of the elemental contributions into a
global coefﬁcient matrix, the above formula can be written in a
concise (matrix) form, as follows:

ear canals and veriﬁes the correctness of this method in the pres-
ent situation.
Running the simulation again under the same geometric condi-
tions but with a source of motion, a ﬁeld point located at the origin
of the coordinates is used to obtain the sound pressure caused by a
moving, pulsating sphere, as shown in Fig. 1. After calculation of
the sound pressure, it is possible to determine the time variation
of the of sound pressure amplitude via the envelope curves. With
the quantity kl (where k is the wave number) set to 0.1, the sound
pressure envelope obtained here and that obtained by Dowling’s
analytical solution [9] were compared, as shown in Fig. 4. The re-
sult obtained in the present work is slightly smaller than that pro-
vided by Dowling’s analytical solution. This difference is due to the
‘‘compact source” assumption utilised in the analytical solutions
presented by Dowling, i.e., kl 1. This assumption would produce
the observed overvaluing of the pressure amplitude. A detailed
explanation can be found in the Appendix. Nevertheless, the vari-
ation trend in the sound pressure calculated from the numerical
procedure developed in this work is the same as the results ob-
tained in Dowling’s analytical solution. From a quantitative point
of view, the correctness can still be viewed as acceptable.
The correctness of the numerical process developed in this work
was veriﬁed via the above procedure. The motion of the sound
source is expected to bring about frequency and amplitude modu-
lation of the sound pressure observed at the entrance of the exter-
nal ear canals. These phenomena are investigated and discussed in
the following cases.
6.2. Case 1
Case 1 is that of a moving sound source with the characteristic
dimension l = 0.03 m at an excitation frequency of f = 500 Hz pass-
ing by a human head. Here, the Mach number varies but the dura-
tion T remains constant at 1 s. The ﬂuid medium of the ﬁeld
domainXwas assumed to have a density of q0 = 1.225 kg/m3, with
a sound velocity of c0 = 340 m/s. The radius of the human head a
was set to 0.085 m, and the shortest distance D between the path
of the moving sound source and the centre of the head was 5 m
when the sound source was moving in front of the head. The size
of an element is Dl and a minimum of six elements per wavelength
is required. The time step Dt can be determined by the relationship
c0Dt/Dlmax = 1 (as required for the stability of the stepping scheme

plane, for various excitation frequencies.

developed in this work can sufﬁciently determine the inﬂuence of
the head on the sound ﬁeld of a moving source over a relatively
unrestricted range of excitation frequencies if the element length
Dl satisﬁes the above-mentioned rule.
Next, Fig. 6 shows the calculated Interaural Level Difference
(ILD) deﬁned by subtracting the SPL of the right side from that of
the left. The results show that the ILD variance conforms to the
physical phenomenon observed when the sound source moves
from left to right with Mach numberM = 0.05. Although the differ-
ence may not be obvious for hearing perception, it still satisﬁes the
just-noticeable difference found in [26]. In other words, the ILD is
an important binaural cue that can be used to discriminate the
direction of the moving source.
For the purpose of investigating the inﬂuence of the speed of
motion on the ILD variation, the time derivatives of the ILD curves
are shown in Fig. 7a. Noticeably, the angles of incidence in the hor-
izontal plane also vary with time when the sound source is moving.
In this situation, a larger linear moving speed of the sound source
presents more rapid variation in the rate of change of incidence an-
gles. For compression, Fig. 7b illustrates the rate of change of inci-
dence angles observed when the Mach number is equal to 0.05,
0.10, and 0.15, respectively. The trends are similar for the curves
shown in Fig. 7a and b. This result means that the rate of change
for the ILD with respect to time is proportional to variation in
the rate of change of incidence angles with respect to the sound
source. Therefore, greater variation in the angles of incidence rep-
resents increased time derivation of the ILD. This is a signiﬁcant re-
sult and explains why the ILD is such an important cue for hearing
perception of source velocity and direction. Notably, direct obser-
vation of the variance in the ILD curves with various speeds is
meaningless, since the lengths of the moving paths are different
with regard to motion at different speeds. That is why the time
derivation of the ILD should be used in the present work.
The inﬂuence of the speed of motion on the shifting frequencies
is also important and, indeed, remarkable. On the basis of the HHT
method, the original sound pressure data can be decomposed into
several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) via Eq. (18). The analytic
signal of each IMF component can then be established with Eq.
(19), where the Hilbert Transform is applied to obtain the imagi-
nary part of an analytic signal. In fact, knowing how many instan-
taneous frequencies are simultaneously present allows for
determination of the required IMF component. Only one IMF is
needed in Case 1, and can even use the HT directly obtained from
the original sound pressure data. However, in most realistic cases,
the instantaneous frequency numbers are unknown, and the value
required for the IMF component depends on the amount of energy
carried by each IMF. To establish a generalised analytic procedure
and to avoid being opportunistic in the present case, one can note
that there are three IMFs that can be extracted from the sound
pressure data for the left ear, with M = 0.10 at an excitation fre-
quency f = 500 Hz, as shown in Fig. 8. The energy carried by the
ﬁrst IMF is far greater than that carried by the others. Thus, the
instantaneously detected frequencies are in accordance with the
ﬁrst IMF. Fig. 9 illustrates a comparison between the instantaneous
frequencies corresponding to different Mach numbers, as heard
from the left and the right ear. The results show that the frequency
will be higher than the original excitation frequency when the
sound source is approaching to the head, and lower than the origi-
nal excitation frequency when the sound source is leaving away
from the head. Obviously, this cue reveals the major difference be-
tween this situation and stationary cases. There seems to be an
imperceptible difference between the frequencies heard by the left
and right ears, but this difference is not clearly detected due to the
noise that exists in the numerical calculations of instantaneous fre-
quencies. Until now, ﬁnding a way to erase or reduce such numer-
ical noise has been an open problem [27]. Thus far, the HHT
method is the most suitable tool for analyses of non-stationary sig-
nals, such as the sound-pressure signals calculated in this work.

(1) The ILD is still an eventful cue, even in the low-frequency
range. The ILD can supply the information necessary for dis-
criminating the velocity and direction of a moving source.
(2) The frequency-shifting phenomenon in motion cases is very
different from that corresponding to stationary cases. Such
shifting can also be an important cue in perceiving the direc-
tion of the moving sound source.
(3) The loudness level of the moving case is larger than that of
the stationary case with the same source strength.

完後，很多單位，包括軟體開發單位都表示很有興趣，希望能進一步交流。其實查看所有
與會之 400 多篇論文，並沒有找到與此發表論文相近的論文。 
 其實本次大會並沒有標榜什麼特殊主題，因此論文置內容並沒有特別集中再哪一個領
域，與去年之領域大致相同，而６篇大會邀請之演講也沒有集中在一特殊主題，分成６大不
同主題。其中３D Sound manipulation：Its Theory and Application 與本人研究較相同，因此參
加此演講。此演講主要在談如何控制 3D 空間的音場，包括有人存在時人雙耳聽到的聲音，
這一部分與本人與學生所發表之論文很相關，都是使用 Head Related Transfer Functions 
(HRTFs)。而 HRTFs 是清大動機系在十多年前就自行量測成的一套資料庫。與此相同的題目，
本人也聽了另一論文發表＂Development of Experimental Dummy and Heasurements of 
Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) for Averaged Korean Head Shape”。十多年前本實驗室量
取 HRTFs 是利用仿人頭系統(Dummy Head)，雖然它是統計結果所做出之仿人頭，但畢竟與
中國人有些出入，而此論文就在探討仿人頭系統與韓國人的平均人頭特性之差異。十多年前
本實驗室也試圖做此比較，但由於當時對 HRTFs 認識的人不多，因此找不到足夠的經費來從
事此研究。現在覺得韓國人都做了，我們也應該做才對。 
3. 感想與帶回之資料 
 除了參加研討會外，也順便了解一下韓國之科技發展，結果發覺韓國人之企圖心比我們
強很多(大概他們有很多大企業集團有關)。整個社會之建設也是很積極，到處都看到大工程
在進行。不過在大都市中心與台灣相同，很多小攤販。由於在首爾搭機，因此也有機會了解
一下首爾情形，由於時間很短，不能深入了解，但有兩點很深印象：(1)整天在市區看不到一
隻狗，(人牽著的都沒有)，因此沒有台灣都市到處都存在之流浪狗及狗大便。(２)整天在路上
