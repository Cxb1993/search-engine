英文摘要： 
Keywords: drilled shaft, load test, gravelly soils, interpretation, analytical model 
Due to constructability issues, environmental factors, etc., drilled shafts are the most 
commonly used foundation type in geotechnical community. In general, the behavior of drilled 
shafts was well developed in the past decades. However, some comprehensive studies related to 
the behavior of drilled shafts are still lacking. For the evaluation of interpretation criteria and 
analytical models of drilled shafts, they can be assessed from small displacement of serviceability 
limit state to large displacement of ultimate limit state. Because of these inconsistencies, it is 
important to establish a consistent model for engineering design practice.  
This study conducted the evaluation of the interpretation criteria of drilled shafts under axial 
and lateral loading for gravelly soils. Since the drilled shaft foundations are designed based on 
some engineering assumptions, it is truly difficult to exactly simulate their behavior using 
numerical model. Therefore, this study adopted back-calculation method from a wide variety of 
field load test data. These data analysis and methods considered the engineering application for 
both international and local geotechnical community.  
Specific design recommendations for drilled shafts in gravelly soils are developed and given 
with the appropriate statistics to describe the quality of the recommendations. The suggested 
displacements (or rotations) and design safety factors (or load factors) for these representative 
interpretation criteria and analytical models are also presented.

Evaluation of Uplift Interpretation Criteria for Drilled Shafts in Gravelly Soils 
Chen, Yit-Jin and Chu, Tsu-Hung 
ABSTRACT 
Representative interpretation criteria are examined in this paper to evaluate the capacity of drilled 
shaft foundations under axial uplift loading in gravelly soils. A large number of uplift shaft load 
tests for gravelly soils are used for analysis, and the interpretation criteria are applied to these load 
test data to establish a consistent uplift interpretation criterion. The statistical results show that the 
smaller the uplift displacement, the higher the coefficient of variation. In general, the 
displacements required to mobilize shaft failure load in gravelly soils are larger than those in 
non-gravelly soils. Based on these analyses, the relative merits and interrelationships of these 
criteria are established. Specific design recommendations for the evaluation of uplift drilled shaft 
capacity are given.

Introduction 
Load-displacement curves from axial load tests on drilled shaft foundations can exhibit any one of 
three shapes, A, B, or C, as shown in Fig. 1. Since the allowable displacement for general 
structures is often limited, most drilled foundation load tests should resemble curve C, so the 
“capacity or failure load” almost always needs to be interpreted from the load test results. Dozens 
of interpretation criteria (e.g., van der Veen 1953; Fuller and Hoy 1970; DeBeer 1970; Chin 1970; 
Davisson 1972; O’Rourke and Kulhawy 1985; Hirany and Kulhawy 1989 and 2002) have been 
proposed over the years for interpreting this failure load. Table 1 defines seven representative 
criteria for the interpreted failure load based on a variety of assumptions, individual judgments, 
extrapolations, and so forth from the measured load-displacement curve. As found in practice, 
these interpretation criteria will give different results that can vary substantially. 
 
Due to these inconsistencies, it is useful to have a straightforward and simple criterion that can be 
applied consistently over a wide range of load tests. Kulhawy and co-workers have examined this 
issue in detail for drilled foundations since the 1980s. Their research (Hirany and Kulhawy 1989, 
2002; Jeon and Kulhawy 2001; Cushing and Kulhawy 2002; Kulhawy 2004; Chen 2004) mainly 
focused on the L1-L2 method, which will be described shortly. Later, Chen and co-authors (Chen, 
et al 2008; Chen and Fang 2009) performed a more extensive evaluation to cover the existing 
representative uplift and compression interpretation criteria for non-gravelly soils. Several other 
researchers (Duzceer and Saglamer 2002; Rollins, et al 2005; Fellenius 2006) have discussed the 
differences among various interpretation methods using field load tests. 
 
In this paper, representative uplift interpretation methods are examined in detail to assess their 
relative merits and their interrelationships. A broad database consisting of axial uplift load tests for 
drilled shafts in gravelly soils is used for this purpose. The results are compared statistically and 
graphically, and conclusions are reached for consistent use in practice. 
 
Database of Load Tests 
The database developed for this study consisted of 36 field uplift load tests conducted at 13 sites. 
 4
Table 5 consists of two groups that are normalized by L1 and L2. For the L1 group, the capacities at 
displacements of 0.3%B and 0.35%B (B = shaft diameter) were used to assess the possible 
position of L1 on the load-displacement curve. For the L2 group, the selected interpretation criteria, 
L1, and 0.5 inch were used to evaluate the capacity interrelationships. For all of these comparisons, 
the number of tests, mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation are given to describe the 
data. 
 
For the L1 group, the mean ratios (QxB/QL1) range from 1.00 to 1.12 with SD and COV between 
0.2 and 0.3. The COV values on L1 group are relatively large, probably because of the 
measurement sensitivity and initial fluctuation of the load test. On average, QL1 is approximately 
equal to Q0.30%B, so therefore the mean ρL1 ≈ 0.30%B. From Table 6, the mean ρL1 is 2.7 mm. 
These results show that the initial linear region occurs within a very small displacement.  
 
For the L2 group, the mean ratios using Davisson, slope tangent, DeBeer, 0.5 inch, van der Veen, 
Fuller and Hoy, and Chin, all compared to QL2, range from 0.69 to 1.22.  Davisson gives the 
lowest values, while Chin gives the highest, well above QL2.  Davisson, slope tangent, DeBeer, 
and 0.5 inch give values < 1 and are therefore in the nonlinear transition between L1 and L2. The 
methods of van der Veen and Fuller and Hoy are close to L2. The statistics show that the lower the 
capacity (or displacement), the higher the COV. Meanwhile, the Davisson method presents a 
higher COV among all interpretation criteria. 
 
Table 6 shows the mean uplift displacements that correspond to each interpretation criterion. The 
order of these displacements is the same as that for the capacities, from Davisson to Chin, with ρ 
values from 5.3 mm to >29.7 mm. The variance of the values from the lower bound to upper 
bound interpretation criteria is relatively obvious, and the COV values on these displacements are 
relatively large. Table 6 shows a mean ρL2 = 18.2 mm. The mean ρL2 of this study for gravelly soils 
is different from non-gravelly soils, which showed the mean ρL2 ≈ 0.5 inch (Chen, et al 2008). 
 
The mean load-displacement curve of gravelly soils for axial uplift loadings is given in Fig. 3. The 
corresponding ratio of each interpretation method to QL2 and its displacement are also shown. 
Considering the values of capacity ratio and COV, the QL1 and QSTU are proper methods for 
inferring the larger capacities if the load test data are insufficient or are terminated prematurely. 
Table 7 compares the regression data for the different interpretation methods, while Fig. 4 shows 
the upper, middle, and lower bounds among the interpretation criteria. Davisson represents the 
lower bound, Chin is the upper bound, and van der Veen is closest to QL2. 
 
Comparison of Different Soils 
Table 8 and Fig. 5 show the comparisons of uplift interpretation criteria for different soils. The 
non-gravelly soils consist of cohesive and cohesionless soils, and the results are referred from the 
results of a previous study by Chen, et al (2008). For easy observation, both points of L1 and L2 are 
also marked in Fig. 5.  
 
Based on these comparisons, it is clear that the mean displacements of all interpretation criteria in 
gravelly soils are larger than those in non-gravelly soils. This phenomenon may be due to the 
somewhat irregular shaft shape existing in the excavation of gravels. With the irregular shaft shape, 
the roughness of the soil-shaft interface increases, and the tendency of gravel to dilate becomes 
important when the shaft is subjected to uplift loading. The factor of overconsolidation ratio (OCR) 
may be the other possibility. In higher OCR and dilatancy, the soils could produce negative water 
pressure and increase effective overburden pressure. Therefore, the displacements required to 
completely mobilize uplift capacity are larger.

EVALUATION OF LATERAL INTERPRETATION CRITERIA FOR DRILLED SHAFTS 
IN GRAVELS  
Marcos, Maria Cecilia M. and Chen, Yit-Jin 
 
ABSTRACT 
Representative lateral interpretation criteria are examined to evaluate the lateral response of 
drilled shaft foundations in gravels. Field lateral load test data are used for the present study, 
which consists of a broad database. The representative criteria are divided into absolute 
displacement, displacement as a function of shaft diameter, rotation limits, mathematical models, 
and graphical construction methods. Comparisons of these criteria show that the initial elastic 
region ends at approximately 3–5 mm, 0.5%B (B = shaft diameter), and 0.08° rotation, which 
represent the serviceability limit state conditions. The final region begins at around 25 mm, 
2.5%B, and 0.33° rotation, which represent the ultimate limit state conditions. The graphical 
construction methods of QL and QS&W are located within the transition region. Among these 
criteria, the displacement limits, QL method, and QS&W method exhibit more reliable results. 
Typical load-displacement curves for lateral capacity in gravels are developed for practical 
engineering use. Recommendations for the use of these lateral interpretation criteria on load test 
data are also given. 
 
Keywords: 
interpretation criteria, drilled shafts, lateral loading, gravels 
 
Introduction 
Drilled shafts have been used to support loads for high-rise buildings, transmission towers, 
bridges, and others. In active seismic areas, such as Taiwan, lateral loads govern the design of 
drilled shafts in many cases. The response of laterally loaded shafts strongly depends on the 
behavior of both the soil and the shaft, in which the relationship is highly nonlinear. Field lateral 
load tests are often used to acquire in-situ soil-shaft behavior. 
 
The shaft lateral capacity can be assessed from field load test results using several interpretation 
criteria (e.g., McNulty 1956; Broms 1964; Walker and Cox 1966; Ivey and Dunlap 1970; Slack 
and Walker 1970; Davidson et al. 1982; Pyke 1984; Briaud 1984; Manoliu et al. 1985; Hirany 
 18
Thus, these load test cases can reflect a range of good field situations, and the results can be 
representative of the actual conditions in practice.  
 
All load tests were conducted on straight-sided drilled shafts with free end. The applied lateral 
load is located at or close to the ground surface and has relatively small eccentricity (e). 
Therefore, the influence of eccentricity can be minimized for analysis. Table 2 shows the basic 
information and the reference sources of the lateral load tests. The shaft diameter ranges from 0.4 
to 1.5 m, while the shaft depth ranges from 6 to 30 m. Some load tests were terminated before 
the interpreted failure load; thus, the last portion of the load-displacement curve for these load 
test data is inferred using the “hyperbolic method”, as suggested by Chen (2004). Moreover, 
several cases did not present the shaft rotation information. For these cases, other assumptions 
are not suggested to obtain the required values. 
 
Interpretation Criteria 
Eleven interpretation criteria, listed in Table 1, are adopted as the basic evaluation methods for 
lateral capacity. In addition, criteria from their extensions, including absolute displacement, 
displacement as a function of shaft diameter (B), and rotation limits are used for the evaluation. 
These criteria are selected because they present a wide distribution of interpreted results, from 
the lower, to the middle and the higher ranges. The criteria also include various types, which can 
be seen in Table 1. Therefore, they are good representative for the evaluation of existing lateral 
interpretation criteria. 
 
The method proposed by Manoliu et al. (1985) is based on a mathematical model of a hyperbola. 
The interpreted capacity corresponds to the asymptote above the load-displacement curves. This 
method normally represents an upper bound for all criteria and is called hyperbolic capacity. 
McNulty (1956), Walker and Cox (1966), and New York City (1981) defined the interpreted 
failure load by the limit of an absolute displacement, while Pyke (1984), Briaud (1984), and 
Broms (1964) used a displacement limit as a function of shaft diameter. The method proposed by 
Davidson et al. (1982), and Ivey and Dunlap (1970) use a rotation limit on the shaft butt (head) 
to determine the lateral capacity. The displacement limit and rotation limit criteria are generally 
based on the practical experience of pile load tests. 
 
Meanwhile, Slack and Walker (1970) recommended a graphical construction method that 
considers the general shape of the overall load-displacement curves. The interpreted failure load 
is defined at the change of slope in the load-displacement curves, as re-drawn on a log-log plot.

displacement, the higher the COV is. A typical load-displacement curve, showing the mean 
interpreted Q/QH and the absolute displacement limit, is illustrated in Fig. 2. It can be seen that 
the data points are in good agreement with the fit curve. The load-displacement curve can be 
divided into three regions: initial more or less elastic region, sharply curving transition region, 
and flattening asymptotic final region. For shafts in gravels, the initial elastic region is reached 
relatively small displacements of around 3-5 mm, while the final region may begin at about 25 
mm displacement. This means that relatively small displacement is needed to develop the lateral 
capacity of shafts in gravels. Generally, these criteria show a consistent relationship between 
loads and displacements. 
 
Displacement limit as a function of shaft diameter  
Table 4 shows the result of the mean interpreted Q/QH for displacement limits as a function of 
shaft diameter (χB%). Results vary from 0.24 to 0.74, showing the same increasing trend as with 
the absolute displacement limits. The SDs are also relatively constant with respect to the 
displacements for these criteria; thus, the lower the displacement, the higher the COV is. Fig. 3 
illustrates the typical load-displacement curve, which uses the mean interpreted Q/QH and the 
displacement limits as a function of shaft diameter. The data points smoothly follow the curve 
and have a wide range of values from the initial to the final region of the curve. The result shows 
that the initial elastic region ends at about 0.5%B displacement, and the final region begins at 
about 2.5%B displacement. These criteria also generally demonstrate the consistent relationship 
between loads and displacements. 
 
Rotation limit  
As previously discussed, some data cases cannot be used for these criteria because of incomplete 
shaft rotation data. Table 4 shows the results of available data for rotation (θ) limits, which have 
a mean interpreted Q/QH ranging from 0.25 to 0.73. The SDs have comparatively constant values; 
thus, the smaller the displacement, the larger the COV is. However, the COVs vary from 0.2 to 
0.74. Fig. 4 illustrates the typical load-rotation curve, which uses the mean interpreted Q/QH and 
the rotation limit. It can be seen that some data points do not show good agreement with the fit 
curve. The initial elastic region ends at around 0.08° rotation, and the beginning of the final 
region occurs at about 0.33° rotation. These results also show that relatively small rotation is 
required to develop the lateral capacity of shafts in gravels. Based on Fig. 4 and the COV values, 
these criteria present more variable results compared with the displacements limits, probably 
because fewer numbers of data are used or due to the presumed high variability of rotation 
results obtained from the field measurement. Therefore, it is suggested that additional data may 
 22
versus δ/B for all criteria are considerably consistent with that of the individual set of 
interpretation method, as examined previously. The fit curve hyperbola for all criteria through the 
load-displacement data is derived by Q/QH = δ/B/[0.81+1.20(δ/B)]. 
 
The normalized load-displacement curves for gravels obtained in the present study are compared 
to the curves recently developed by Chen et al. (2011) for rigid drilled shafts in general drained 
soils. The curves for gravels demonstrate a significantly stiffer load-displacement behavior, 
which is attributed to the more dilative behavior of gravel which regains its strength during 
shearing. Moreover, pile response under gravels can provide better resistance to displacement 
and rotation compared with drained soils. Interestingly, Chen et al. (2011) proposed an SLS for 
drained soils at absolute displacement of 10 mm and 1% B, which is twice larger than that for 
gravels (5 mm and 0.5%B). Furthermore, Chen et al. (2011) proposed an SLS of 0.3ο rotation, 
which is around three times larger than the value acquired in this study of 0.08ο. In addition, 
relatively comparable results are observed for the ULS suggestions in this study and Chen et al.’s 
proposal – drained soils can provide a threshold of 50 mm or 4%B displacements and 0.9ο 
rotation, while at almost the same capacity ratio, gravels yields only around 25 mm or 2.5%B 
displacements and 0.33ο rotation. Clearly, better strength behavior can be expected for piles 
under gravels. The results in Fig. 6 can also serve as a preliminary estimation in cases where load 
test is terminated prematurely and load capacity must be inferred.  
 
Summary and Conclusions 
Lateral load tests in predominantly gravel profile were evaluated for straight-sided drilled shafts. 
Representative interpretation criteria were used for the evaluation. The interpreted loads from 
these criteria were then compared. Based on the analyses, the following conclusions are derived: 
(1) The load-displacement (or rotation) curves for gravels demonstrate a significantly stiffer 
behavior than that for general drained soils. 
(2) Statistical data show that the smaller the lateral displacement, the higher the COV for the 
comparison of the interpreted results.  
(3) The fit curve hyperbola for all the criteria through the normalized load-displacement data is 
derived by Q/QH = δ/B/[0.81+1.20(δ/B)].  
(4) The initial elastic region ends at approximately 0.30–0.35 Q/QH, which corresponds to about 
3–5 mm, 0.5%B, and 0.08°. These clearly represent the SLS conditions for gravels. The final 
region begins at about 0.65 Q/QH, which corresponds to around 25 mm displacement, 2.5%B, 
and 0.33° rotation. These results represent the ULS conditions.

Performance of Earth Structures”等對這些文章進行演講及討論。這四個題目分別探討大
地工程(geotechnical engineering)及地工織物材料的數值分析、試驗、及可靠度分析等，
尤其強調在振動分析方面。詳細介紹他們從事大地工程多年的經驗及所遭遇的問題案例
的解決對策，會中並開放與與會者討論問題。從他們對以上議題的介紹，對本人有相當
的幫忙。 
此次研討會大會亦安排三場short courses，包括Advanced Principles of Slope Stability 
Analysis、Application of Geophysics to Geotechnical Problems及Augered Cast-in-Place Piles: 
Design, Construction, Load Test, and Case Studies，分別由此領域的專家學者作一系列的
介紹與說明。邊坡穩定、地工織物材及樁基礎均為大地工程最為廣泛的議題，因此相當
多人興趣及報名參加。 
此次大會所收錄之論文可說包羅萬象、各俱特色，頗富工程參考價值，世界各國在
大地工程持續發展經營中，於大地、地工織物材、邊坡穩定、基礎工程、地盤改良及現
地試驗各方面所面臨的難題，以及用以解決的方式。各參與技術展示之廠商亦涵蓋美國
及國際各知名之顧問公司、著名儀器商、學協會等約有 50 多個攤位，包括大地工程、
邊坡、地盤改良、基礎、液化及結構等之分析軟體，大地結構相關之量測儀器及分析系
統，各式各樣的大地工程新開發材料與技術，及施工儀器介紹等，可謂包括各類的先進
地工技術，讓我們對於國際間目前於大地工程相關工程的應用有更進一步之認識。
