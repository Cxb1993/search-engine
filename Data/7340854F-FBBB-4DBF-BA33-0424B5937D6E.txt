  
queues to accommodate different classes of messages to 
facilitate design problems. In summary of the aforementioned 
situations, this study is intended to analyze the multi-queue 
M/M/1 model with finite length. The dedicated model is 
expressed as q-M/M/1/Ki/FCFS/QSR, where q is the number 
of queues (q > 1), Ki is the upper bound of the buffer length for 
Qi. FCFS [5] is the default queueing discipline in the selected 
queue and QSR denotes the queue selection rules between 
queues, which can be either the priority (PRI) polling [2] or 
FCFS polling [7] in this study. Our analysis is based on 
arrival/departure (or birth-death) process which is originated 
from the study of the single queue M/M/1 model. However, 
special treatment is desired due to the existing multiple queue 
selection after service competition and limited buffer size. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, 
the arrival/departure process of an M/M/1 model is briefly 
introduced. The main part of the multi-dimensional joint state 
analysis of the multi-queue M/M/1 model is discussed in 
Section III. In Section IV, we illustrate an example study of a 
two-queue problem. The complete state diagram and their state 
balance equations are established clearly. To verify the 
performance of our proposed methods, simulation experiments 
are conducted in Section V to show the state probabilities. 
Conclusions and future remarks are also drawn in Section VI. 
II.  ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE (AD) PROCESS 
The M/M/1 model is a pure AD process, where at instant 
time at most one event occurs with either the arrival of a new 
message
1
 or the completion of a message’s service. Actually, 
the AD process describes probabilistically how the number of 
messages or states changes as time evolves. The arrows in 
Figure 1 illustrate the possible transitions between states. The 
rate at which a transition occurs is  (arrival rate) for a 
transition from state n to state n+1 (i.e. an arrival) and  
(service rate) for a transition from state n+1 to state n (i.e. a 
departure).  
Figure 1. The arrival/departure process of an M/M/1 model. 
The state probability Pn of exactly n messages in the queue 
can be derived after the system has reached a steady-state 
condition. At the steady state, Pn,  n0, satisfies the 
following equations 
(1)  
                                                          
1 This terminology “message” originates from the study of the controller area 
network. 
Eq. (1) is called the balance equation or the conservation-flow 
relationship for state n. The above analysis guarantees that any 
incoming request would find a place to be queued. In fact, the 
model with finite length should be better suited to approximate 
the real-world problems. In these situations, the M/M/1/K 
model with a maximum number of K messages in queue is still 
a pure AD process. Another variant of the M/M/1 model 
considers the case when there are multiple queues for 
messages. In this circumstance, the means to serve the 
messages should also depend on the queue selection 
disciplines. Thus, the notation q-M/M/1/Ki/FCFS/QSR, an 
extension from Kendall notation [6], is well suited for this 
study. In the rest of this paper, we should use “*” to denote 
different QSRs. 
III. STATE SPACE TRANSITION 
In the q-M/M/1/Ki/FCFS/* model, each queue Qi is with 
different arrival rate i and service rate i, respectively. The 
arrival processes are independent amongst each other. In 
addition, the utilization factor i of Qi is characterized as i= 
i/i. Thus, the total utilization factor  of the system is ii. 
The crucial factor to analyze the multi-queue model should 
first estimate the multi-dimensional state probability. 
First of all, let us define the joint state (or state in short) in 
the multi-queue model. Intuitively, the state of the multi-queue 
model is a q-tuple array x=(n1,n2,…,nq), where ni denotes the 
number of queued messages in Qi. The vector x takes values in 
the state space S={(n1,n2,…,nq)0niKi}. Considering the 
involved QSRs, the state transitions strongly depend on the 
queue being served. Thus, an alternative form using a 
(q+1)-tuple can give a more compact representation. We then 
represent the state as xs=(n1,n2,…,nq;s) where s indicates the 
queue currently being severed. Clearly, s belongs to 
{0,1,2,…,q}. In particular, when s is zero, namely x0, the server 
is idle. The total number of all feasible states Nq for q queues 
can also be calculated as 
(2)  
with different state probabilities
s
px . 
The major conclusion which can be drawn from the AD 
process is that the message flows into a given state are equal to 
the message flows out of that state. Based on this fact, it is 
clear that the message flows must be conserved in the 
equilibrium status for any arbitrary state xs. Actually, there are 
four quantities contributed to the message flows. From the 
view point of xs, two of them, IA sx  and ID sx , are due to the 
incoming message flows from other states to xs. The other two, 
OA
sx
 and OD
sx
, belong to the outgoing message flows from xs 
to other states. Obviously, the steady-state balance function for 
xs is expressed as

 and

ODx  
for possible state transitions. Considering the state (K1,K2;1), 
the possible 
1
IAx  comes from (K1-1,K2;1) and (K1,K2-1;1). 
Similarly, the possible 
1
ODx  from (K1,K2;1) can only go to 
(K1-1,K2;1) and (K1-1,K2;2). The balance equation for state 
(K1,K2;1) becomes 
(11)  
Inside the parenthesis of Eq. (11), the sum of probabilities is 
one. As a result, Eq. (11) becomes 
(12)  
In a particular case of K1=K2=2, thirteen balance equations 
(refer to Eq. (2)) can be formulated to represent different 
transitions between states. In Figure 3, a complete state flow 
diagram is demonstrated. The arrows in this diagram show the 
acceptable state transitions and are labeled with the mean 
transition rates and queue selection probabilities. Although 
Figure 3 is a general framework of either the 
2-M/M/1/Ki/FCFS/FCFS or 2-M/M/1/Ki/FCFS/PRI models, 
their differences are the values of queue selection 
probabilities. 
At this point, the equilibrium state probabilities can be 
formed by writing and solving the corresponding balance 
equations. Accordingly, a set of linear balance equations for 
all states can be formulated. In Eq. (13), we summarize all of 
these balance equations in detail. 
 
 
(13)  
To avoid trivial solution, we need any twelve independent 
equations in Eq. (13) and the normalization condition, 
1 21 2
, ;, ,
1n n sn n s p  , to solve thirteen unknowns. This set of 
equations, even if it is large, may be solved to obtain the 
actual state probabilities straightforwardly. Once the state 
probabilities are solved, one can use them to obtain the 
required queue performance parameters. For example, the 
probability Pk;s of k messages in Qs can be formulated as 
(14)  
Other interesting quantities, such as mean queue length Ls 
and message waiting time Ws in Qs, can be established by the 
Little formula [4]. 
I.  SIMULATIONS 
In this section, we present experiments regarding the 
2-M/M/1/Ki/FCFS/* model with either PRI or FCFS as the 
QSRs. The queue capacity is limited to 2 for Q1 and Q2, i.e. 
K1=K2=2. The values of  are changed from 0.2 to 4 with step 
value 0.2. The individual utilization factor i of Q1 and Q2 is 
distributed according to the ratio 4:6. The service times for 
each message are 1 and 2 in average for two queues. The 
arrival rates i can also be derived based on these settings. As 
a result, the ratio of 1 to 2 is 4:3. Due to the random natures 
of the exponential distribution, each  will take 100,000 
iterations and then the measured quantities are averaged. 
We show the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) of the 
measured state probabilities 
1 2
measured
, ;n n sp  from runtime and the 
solved state probabilities in Eq. (13). The measured quantity 
is defined as the ratio of the time that the serve serves Qs, 
namely in the state (n1,n2,;s), to the total simulation time. 
Then the RMSE of 
1 2, ;n n sp  is written as 
(15)  
Figure 4 (a) and (b) demonstrate the RMSE curves for two 
different QSRs, respectively. The x-axis indicates the state
