本計畫同時進行四種不同尺度之力學性質估測問題即: 非對稱疊層板、複材漸縮
翼、拍翼式微飛機、及多壁奈米碳管等，希望藉由處理過程的經驗觀察不同尺度間
之關連性，以期能提出一縱貫多重尺度之力學分析方法，以擴展力學之視野與適用
範圍。 在這四類題材中前二主題屬延續性研究，分別與個人前期之研究計畫”複材
疊 層 板 偶 合 解 析 理 論 之 建 構 與 應 用 (1/2, 2/2) (NSC-92-2212-E-006-132 ，
NSC-93-2212-E-006-025)” 、”複材機翼結構之線上量測及最佳控制設計(1/3,2/3,3/3) 
(NSC 92-2212-E-006-080，NSC 93-2212-E-006-032，NSC 94-2212-E-006-011)” 相關。 
前者將原研究之成果與邊界元素法結合發展出一精確又有效之數值方法，以輔助非
對稱疊層板之線上量測工作。 後者將原發展之等弦機翼理論與有限元素結合，將其
適用範圍延伸至漸縮機翼(tapered wing)，以輔助一般複材漸縮機翼之線上量測。這
二項工作經過三年的努力，基本上已順利完成非對稱疊層板之邊界元素設計與複材
漸縮翼之有限元素設計，唯獨在線上量測工作之應用上遇到些許困擾。從而轉向進
行更接近奈米尺度之奈米壓痕實驗量測及奈米碳管實驗量測，結果對我們尋找一貫
穿巨觀與微奈米尺度之力學通則確實有很大之幫助。除前二主題外，另二主題“拍
翼式微飛機拍翼強度估測”與“多壁奈米碳管力學性質估測”，則皆如預期般之順
利完成。 前者困難之處在於動態拍蹼之模擬，後者在於如何利用巨觀世界之結構力

Abstract 
This project works on the estimate of mechanical 
properties of four different scale structures which are 
unsymmetric laminated composites, tapered composite 
wings, flapping micro-air-vehicles, multi-walled carbon 
nanotubes. Hope that a unified approach for all 
multi-scale structures can be proposed through the 
experience of this research. Among these four topics, two 
of them are continuing works of my previous projects: “A 
novel formalism for the coupled analysis of composite 
laminates (1-2/2) (NSC-92-2212-E-006-132 ，
NSC-93-2212-E-006- 025),” and “On-line measurement 
and optimal control of composite wing structures (2/3) 
(NSC 93-2212-E-006-032)”. In the former, we plan to 
combine the newly developed Stroh-like formalism with 
boundary element technique to develop a powerful 
numerical method to help the on-line measurement of 
unsymmetric laminates. While in the latter, we plan to 
combine another newly developed comprehensive wing 
model with finite element technique to make our model be 
valid for the vibration analysis of tapered composite 
wings and also help the on-line measurement of tapered 
composite wings. Besides the estimate of conventional 
structural components, in this project we also try to study 
the dynamic strength of flapping wings and the 
mechanical properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes, 
which are difficult due to “flapping” and “nano”. 
According to some published results and my personal 
experience, we plan to utilize the equivalent torsion 
concept to deal with the flapping problem and the 
equivalent energy concept to deal with the nano-problem. 
 To achieve the above stated goals, we have now 
completed the following works: 1. the Green’s function 
of unsymmetric laminates, 2. finite element modeling of 
tapered composite wings, 3. numerical simulation of 
flapping wings, 4. equivalent structural analysis of 
carbon naotube. 
 
Keywords: Unsymmetric Laminated Composites,

1. Green’s Function for the Composite 
Laminates with Bending  Extension Coupling 
 In this research we consider the problem of 
an infinite composite laminate subjected to 
concentrated forces and moments at any arbitrary 
points. The elasticity solution of this problem can 
be used as a fundamental solution of boundary 
element method and is generally called Green’s 
function. The importance of Green’s function in 
constructing solutions to boundary value problems 
has been well recognized. It is therefore, many 
analytical closed form solutions of Green’s

2. Modelling of Tapered Composite Wing 
Structures 
Numerous different analytical model of the 
composite wing structures such as the classical 
beam model, the coupled bending-torsion model, 
and the refined models taking warping restraint, 
transverse shear deformation, shell bending strain, 
and cross-sectional materials and geometries into 
account have been developed in the past several 
 11
and the skeletons are made by Carbon/Epoxy 
prepregs. Mapped mesh and free mesh are used in 
modeling. The wings are fixed at the connection 
points of wings and flapping mechanism. The 
lifting pressure is approximated by a two-variable 
second order polynomial. The convergence 
analysis is performed to make sure the correctness 
of the output values. Figures 3.1-3.4 show the 
progress of present research.

4. Stress Analysis of Carbon Nanotube 
Since Iijima’s discovery in 1991 (Iijima, 
1991), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have stimulated 
extensive research activities devoted to 
nanomechanics and their applications in 
nanoengineering. Due to their exceptional 
mechanical and electrical properties: small size, 
low density, high stiffness, high strength etc., 
CNTs represent a very promising material in many 
areas of science and industry. 
The elastic properties of multi- and 
singled-walled nanotubes (MWNTs and SWNTs) 
have been the subject of numerous research works 
in experimental, molecular dynamics, and elastic 
continuum modeling approaches. For examples, 
experimental investigations conducted by Treacy 
et al. (1996), who used TEM to measure the 
Young’s modulus of MWNTs, reported a mean 
value of 1.8 Tpa with a variation from 0.40 to 4.15 
Tpa; Krishnam et al. (1998) also used TEM to 
observe the vibration of a SWNT and obtained the 
Young’s modulus ranged from 0.90 to 1.70 Tpa; 
Wong et al. (1997) conducted bending tests on 
cantilevered tubes using atomic force microscopy 
and estimated a Young’s modulus of 1.28 Tpa; 
Poncharal et al. (1999) observed the static and 
dynamic mechanical deflections of cantilevered 
MWNTs, which is induced by an electric field, and 
reported a modulus about 1.0 Tpa for 
small-diameter tubes. 
Besides the experimental works on CNTs, 
many researchers try to analyze the elastic 
properties of CNTs by theoretical modeling 
techniques. These modeling approaches can be 
generally classified into two categories. One is the 
molecular dynamics (MD) method (Iijima et al., 
1996; Gao et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1998; Zhou et 
al., 2000; Belytschko et al., 2002), which is based 
on the force field and total potential energy related 
to the interatomic potentials for CNTs in a 
macroscopic sense. In this method, the bonding 
and nonbonding potentials are represented in terms 
 13
they selected the values of the force constants rk , 
kθ  and kτ  according to the experience with 
graphite sheets as 
1 -2 -7= 938 kcal mol   A =6.53 10  N/nmrk
−⋅ ⋅ ×
D
, 
1 2 -10 2= 126 kcal mol /rad =8.79 10  N nm/radkθ
−⋅ × ⋅
,and kτ  is adopted as 
1 2 -10 240 kcal mol /rad =2.79 10  N nm/rad−⋅ × ⋅ , 
 which is numerically proven to have little 
influence on CNTs’ Young’s modulus in their paper. 
By self-developed program, the computed elastic 
properties of the SWNTs are obtained and their 
dependence on the tube diameter is also discussed. 
Note that the Poisson’s ratio ν , which is one 
of the primary property of materials, does not 
appear explicitly in the formulation of Li and Chou 
briefly reviewed above. However, by the selected 
values of the force constants, the restriction of the 
Poisson’s ratio that should be a positive number 
smaller than 0.5 is violated when calculating its 
value from Eq. (4.7) and the well known 
relationship of E and G, i.e. )1(2/ ν+= EG , for 
an isotropic and uniform beam. In fact, all the 
other available choices of the values of the force 
constants found in literatures can’t satisfy this 
restriction either. This is the main defect necessary 
to be solved or avoided for theoretical 
completeness of this approach. 
In the present study, a finite element method 
implemented by the commercial code ANSYS, 
instead of the stiffness method, is developed under 
the same theoretical base described above. The 
major advantage of the FE approach proposed here 
is that no extra effort is needed for program coding 
and consequently make the present approach more 
feasible for mechanical analysis of nanotubes. 
 In our finite element modeling work, the 
BEAM4 element in ANSYS is selected to simulate 
the carbon bonds while the atoms are nodes. Figure 
4.1 (modified from Tserpes and Papanikos, 2005) 
depicts how the hexagonal lattice of the CNT is 
simulated as structure elements of a space frame, 
where cca −  stands for the initial length of C-C 
bond. 
To determine the elastic properties of the 
BEAM4 element for input into the ANSYS code, 
we assume that the cross sections of the beam 
elements are identical and circular, and note that 
only the Young’s modulus E, the Poisson’s ratio ν  
and the diameter of the circular cross section d are 
needed to prepare for the properties of the BEAM4 
element. From the first two equations of Eq. (4.7), 
we have

=    (4.8) 
By Eq. (4.8) and the values of rk  and kθ  
given above, the numerical values of E and d are 
calculated as 5.49 Tpa and 0.147 nm respectively. 
The element length is set to be equal to the initial 
C-C bond length cca −  of 0.142 nm. As to the 
Poisson’s ratioν , several values of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 
and 0.3 have been examined for the present FE 
model, and the tests prove that ν  has little effect 
on the final result in our computation. Therefore, 
we set ν  = 0.3 as a representative value in the FE 
model. 
Before we key in the input data of the 
BEAM4 element properties, the dimensions of the 
parameters stated above should be further adjusted 
to avoid digits overflow/underflow error during the 
computation performed by ANSYS. Thus, we 
adjust the dimensions as follows 
    , 10   , 10 in

10
in EEFFLL ===  (4.9) 
where the original dimensions of length L, force F 
and modulus E are m, N and N/m2 respectively, and 
the subscript “in” denotes the real input values. 
After such adjustment, the numerical parts of the 
input data prepared for the BEAM4 element can be 
listed as follows 
   0.3   , 69.1   , 1049.5 inin
12
in ==×= νAE , 
where 4/2inin dA π=  is the area of the cross 
section, din = 1.47 is the diameter of the circular 
section. Figure 4.2 depicts the typical FE model 
for calculating the Young’s modulus of a single 
SWNT.

3. Lift of Flapping Wings 
In this research, the lifting pressure is 
approximated by a two-variable second order 
polynomial, which may be written as 
fyexdyxcybxayxp +++++= 22),(    (18) 
where x  and y  are nondimensionalized 
coordinates defined by Lxx /=  and Hyy /= . 
L and H, denotes respectively, the length and width 
of the flapping wings. The coefficients 
fedcba ,,,,,  defining the surface variation of the 
lift will be determined through a well trained 
artificial neural network (ANN). To provide a well 
trained ANN, in this research we prepare the 
training pattern through the finite element 
modeling. In this modeling the flapping wings are 
analyzed by using the commercial finite element 
code ANSYS. The SHELL91 and SHELL99 
elements are selected to model the wing skins and 
skeletons. The skins are made by LD-PE plastics 
and the skeletons are made by Carbon/Epoxy 
prepregs. Mapped mesh and free mesh are used in 
modeling. The wings are fixed at the connection 
points of wings and flapping mechanism. The 
convergence analysis is performed to make sure 
the correctness of the output values. In this 
network the input vector contains the strain values 
of three different positions of the wings, while the 
output vector contains the coefficients of equation 
(18). To make sure the ANN is well trained, test 
patterns are prepared through both numerical 
modeling and experimental measurement. After 
ANN is well trained, the lift acting on the flapping 
wings can then be estimated through the strains 
measured on the wings. Figure 5 shows the 
mechanism of the flapping wings and three 
positions for the strain measurement. Figures 6a-c 
show the lift estimated by ANN and measured 
strains associated with three different flapping 
frequencies.

中文摘要 
本計畫同時進行四種不同尺度之力學性質估測問題即: 非對稱疊層板、複材漸縮翼、拍翼
式微飛機、及多壁奈米碳管等，希望藉由處理過程的經驗觀察不同尺度間之關連性，以期
能提出一縱貫多重尺度之力學分析方法，以擴展力學之視野與適用範圍。 依據此一目標，
本計畫第一年已按進度完成了 1.1 非對稱複材疊層板葛林函數之推導；1.2 漸縮複材機翼結
構理論之建立; 1.3 微飛機機翼之數值模擬; 1.4 奈米碳管之等效結構力學分析，等初步工
作。第二年則接續完成了 2.1 偶合邊界元素程式之設計；2.2 漸縮複材機翼有限元素之程
式設計；2.3 拍翼式微飛機之翼表面升力 - 等效靜態分佈力；2.4 凡得瓦力之結構力學模
擬，等期中工作。今年是第三年也是本計畫之最後一年，我們原預計完成之工作有 3.1 非
對稱複材疊層板材料常數之線上量測；3.2 漸縮複材機翼材料常數之線上量測; 3.3 微飛機
拍翼強度之預測; 3.4 多壁奈米碳管力學性質之估測。 然因前二項在完成程式設計後，實
際執行面發生一些問題，一直在測試當中，無法直接應用在線上量測的研究工作上，我們
從而轉向另二項材料量測問題：(a) 奈米壓痕實驗量測；(b) 奈米碳管實驗量測。 這些研
究項目的完成確實讓我們對數種不同尺度之力學性質估測及量測有了進一步之認識。

Abstract 
This project works on the estimate of mechanical properties of four different scale structures which 
are unsymmetric laminated composites, tapered composite wings, flapping micro-air-vehicles, 
multi-walled carbon nanotubes.  Through the experience of this research work, we that a unified 
approach for all multi-scale structures can be proposed in the near future. Aiming on this goal, in 
the first year we have completed the following works: 1.1 the Green’s function of unsymmetric 
laminates, 1.2 finite element modeling of tapered composite wings, 1.3 numerical simulation of 
flapping wings, 1.4 equivalent structural analysis of carbon naotube. While in the second year, we 
completed: 2.1 BEM design for coupled stretching-bending analysis, 2.2 FEM design for tapered 
composite wings, 2.3 lift of flapping wings, 2.4 Van der Waals force modelling, etc. In our original 
project proposed four years ago, this year we plan to work on the following four problems: 3.1 
on-line measurement for the unsymmetric composite laminates; 3.2 on-line measurement for the 
tapered composite wings; 3.3 strength prediction for flapping wings of micro-air-vehicle; 3.4 
estimation for the mechanical properties of multi-walled carbon nanotube. However, in our work 
the test results for the BEM and FEM design completed one year ago are still not perfect yet. 
Therefore, we shift our first two topics to (a) nano-indentation measurement; and (b) experiment 
on the measurement of carbon nanotube. Through these research works, we really get some sense 
for the estimation and measurement of the multi-scale materials and structures.   
Keywords: Unsymmetric Laminated Composites, Tapered Composite Wings, Flapping Micro-Air-Vehicles, 
Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes, Mechanical Properties, On-Line Measurement, Multi-Scale Structures

量測振翅翼應變之方法為，先沿著翅膀破壞點表面的纖維排向黏貼應變規(如圖
1.1)，再將其固定於振翅機構上，而後給予馬達電壓驅使其轉動，並經由示波器儲
存量測到之電壓，大致流程如下： (a)黏貼應變規：翅膀在振翅時，骨架與鋁製支
架連接處的應力為翅膀中最大值，因此將此處視為破壞點；而由於振翅拍頻對破壞
點纖維排向應變的影響較其他兩方向明顯許多，因此，為了減少實驗時應變規導線
拉扯所造成的誤差，則僅測量破壞點表面纖維排向之應變，並將應變規黏貼於此。 (b)
固定振翅翼：應變規黏貼好之後，便利用支架將翅膀與振翅機構固定，需將應變規
之導線利用膠帶固定於機構上，並留下適當之伸縮空間以免在振翅過程中因拉扯產
生誤差。 (c)應變規歸零：取振翅翼最低角度為零點，並將信號放大器歸零，以確
保每次量測的起始位置與起始值皆相同，之後每測量一個振翅拍頻後皆需做重新歸
零的動作，以免因應變規偏差而造成實驗的誤差。(d)測量應變：在測量應變的部份，
由於應變規無法承受較高振翅拍頻所造成的應變變化，因此，為了增加測量值以進
行估測，所以採用可穩定控制較多低轉速值的直流碳刷馬達來進行測量應變的實
驗；在應變規歸零後，將電池連接至控制器上，並將可變電阻從 0°順時針作些微的
調轉以達到馬達之起始電壓，並按下啟動鈕，則馬達開始轉動，同時將轉速測量計
所量測出之轉速與信號放大器傳送至示波器之電壓值加以記錄；完成此轉速後，再
於翅膀最低角度將應變規歸零，並將可變電阻再順時針做些微調轉，使電壓提高且
振翅拍頻提升，再進行測量動作。重複此步驟至可變電阻轉到底後，約可測得 40
組資料，將所紀錄之資料進行下一步驟之換算及整理。(e)資料整理：因本實驗目的
是想求得各振翅拍頻下破壞點表面纖維排向應變的最大值，所以將示波器資料傳至
電腦後，取出穩定波段中每一個波的最大電壓相加並取平均值，再將此平均的電壓
值轉換成應變值(如圖 1.2)，重覆此動作即可得 40 組振翅拍頻與最大應變的資料。 
將實驗結果依最大應變與振翅拍頻之關係擬合關係式(如圖 1.3)，再將臨界應變
(以傳統方法測量本實驗所使用之振翅翼骨架材料: 碳纖維預浸布材料纖維排向之
臨界應變值為 0.01944)代入關係式中，藉由外插估測破壞振翅拍頻為 18.032 Hz；估
測完成後，實際將翅膀拍斷，並記錄實際之破壞振翅拍頻為 18.733 Hz，因此可看出
我們提出之估測值與實際值確實相當接近，誤差僅約 4.25%。然並非每一次實驗都
能提供如此完美之估測，較詳細的結果與討論請參考(王俊人，2007) 及近期即將整
理發表之文章。

ANSYS 去推算楊氏係數的方法可分為兩種，第一種為使用材料力學理論中，碳管
受拉伸後，應力與應變的關係式去推算楊氏係數；第二種為使用彈性力學理論中應
變能與楊氏係數的關係式去推算楊氏係數，再將前述兩種方法所推算出之楊氏係數
互相比較，同時為了驗證所得結果的正確性，本計畫利用於 ANSYS 中推算所得到
之單壁碳管楊氏係數，配合使用複合材料力學與薄殼理論的方法，以解析的方法去
分別計算出單、多壁碳管的某些力學性質，並與使用 ANSYS 所推算出來之相對應
的結果互相比較，以期能夠達到驗證的目的。圖 2.1-2.5 即本計畫之部份代表性結

3. 奈米壓痕實驗量測 
傳統力學材料性質測試一般分為兩種，一種採用單軸拉伸(tension)、壓縮
(compression)、扭轉(torsion)試驗獲得應力(stress)和應變(strain)關係，另一種則為接
觸試驗獲得應力和硬度關係。但隨著科技進步，電子零件越來越微小，且要求精密
度越來越高情況下，物件尺度達至微米或奈米級，由於傳統測試無法將原子間力量、
尺度效應真實呈現，為顯現微小尺度之機械性質，奈米測試技術成為重要量測方法。
其優點除了可控制極小荷重及選擇壓痕作用範圍外，亦可量測材料在奈米尺度下彈
性(elasticity)及塑性(plasticity)行為。奈米技術測試中現今包括原子力顯微術、表面
力量測法、奈米壓痕、奈米刮痕等。其中又以奈米壓痕(nano-indentation)和奈米刮痕
(nano-scratch)試驗較為普遍，因對測試物並無特別幾何要求，且測試物如為薄膜亦
不需與基材(substrate)剝離。奈米壓痕技術利用施加正向單軸外力於壓痕器(indenter)
測得試片楊氏係數(Young’s modulus)、硬度(hardness)、殘留應力(residual stress)等機
械性質，再以原子顯微鏡 AFM(atomic force microscopy)觀測壓痕區域形貌。奈米刮
痕技術則利用施加單軸橫向外力於壓痕器測得薄膜摩擦係數、薄膜於基材上之附著
力等機械性質。然而現今量測奈米尺度機械性質所採用之奈米壓痕試驗，雖可提供
各項基本機械性質，但實驗所得之材料參數卻仍有許多改善空間。因為實驗過程中
所得之材料參數為理論公式推導而得，但理論公式中定義許多假設，實際上與現實
環境不符。因此本計畫研究其修正方法，並以此修正方法更深入探討和改進奈米壓
痕試驗。 
本研究以有限元素法模擬奈米壓痕負載-深度曲線，將模擬曲線和奈米壓痕實驗
所得負載-深度曲線及文獻相互比較，以確定有限元素模擬的正確性。在確認數值模
擬之正確性後，即以許多不同材料性質所得之負載-深度曲線建構足夠之訓練模組，
以配合類神經網路系統歸納模擬取得材料性質與負載-深度曲線之逆關係。如此當以
奈米壓痕實驗取得負載-深度曲線後，即可運用所建構之類神經網路系統逆運算得到
較正確之材料常數，以期改善傳統以理想理論解反算求得之材料常數。本研究所使
用之有限元素軟體為ANSYS，為取得較正確之模擬，分別模擬在平面應力、平面應

6th Euromech Solid Mechanics Conference (ESMC2006) 
August 28 – September 1, 2006 
Budapest, Hungary 
 
胡潛濱，成大航太系 
2006. 9. 5. 
參加會議經過： 
 
6th European Solid Mechanics Conference (ESMC2006)，此一會議為歐
洲力學學會(European Mechanics Society)每隔三年舉辦ㄧ次的跨國性學
術研討會，前五次分別在 Munich, Germany (1991), Genova, Italy (1994), 
Stockholm, Sweden (1997), Metz, France (2000) and Thessaloniki, Greece 
(2003)，這已是第六屆，在 Hungary 首都 Budapest 之 Budapest University 
of Technology and Economics (BME) 舉辦，該校歷史悠久，今年已是該
校之 225 周年。 我個人自第五屆開始參與這一系列的會議，這次是第
二次。 這次會議參與的學者約 350 人，由於此一會議為歐洲固體力學
會議，並非一般的國際性會議，因此大多數的與會學者來自歐洲地區(分
別來自 30 個不同國度之歐洲國家)，亞洲及美洲則相對較少(約 19 個其
他各洲國家)，台灣地區除了我個人之外還有台大機械、台大應力、交大、
興大、淡大、及成大土木等教授合計共 8 人參與。 
本次會議安排一個大會演講，7 個專題演講，14 個 mini-symposiums  
和 2 個 Poster Sessions。 除學術演講之安排外，本次會議非常細心地安
排了許多 Social Program: 如會前一天(8/27)之 Get-together Party，第一天
(8/28)之 Welcome Reception，第二天(8/29)之 Organ Concert，第三天(8/30)
之 Excursion to Visegrad，第四天(8/31)之 Boat Banquet。每個 Social 
Program 都安排許多協助之工作人員，讓我們海外參與的學者感到大會
之體貼與細心。 此次會議稍稍讓人感到美中不足的是大會並未準備論
文摘要集，僅只提供 CD，這讓與會學者在聽演講的時候無法參閱講者
投稿之摘要，稍微減損聽的效果。 除此之外，另一不方便的地方是會
場相當分散，想要從其中一個會場轉到另一會場聆聽自己想聽的演講很
不方便。 整體而言，這是一個相當成功的國際會議，成功地提供了參
與學者交換研究心得的時間與空間。

除自己發表論文及聆聽相關演講外，這次會議我再度(前次即三年前
之 ESMC)遇到我博士求學期間之助理教授 Prof. John Botsis, 而今他已
離開美國到瑞士任教(Swiss Federal Institute of Technology)且早已升等為
Full Professor，在歐洲的系統中正教授頗具權威，細看會議資料也才知
道他是此次會議 ESMC Scientific Committee 的 Member。 
    
 
建議： 
 
 此次會議之主辦單位相當細心，吸引許多來自世界各地的學者前來
與會，究其原因和下列數個因素有關： (1) 本會屬歐洲大型力學會議之
系列；(2)會議地點 Budapest 是匈牙利之首都，被指定為世界文化遺產，
同時有「多瑙河的珍珠」之美譽。 近幾年來國內所舉辦的國際會議越
來越多，但地點之選擇不太講究，同時配合會議的活動不多，因此常常
無法吸引大多數的學者前來台灣開會。 有鑑於此，以近年來參加國際
會議的經驗提供數點建議給未來想辦國際會議的同仁參考。 
 1. 應爭取已具規模之國際會議的主辦權，如此可吸引較多且較優秀
之學者前來，同時也較能過濾文章之品質。 
2. 會前所接到之任何信函都必須即時回覆以免預期參與之學者有
任何掛心之事。  
3. 會議之安排必須非常細心，例如：論文集應找國際知名書商承印
以廣開銷售管道並打開國內相關研究之國際知名度，同時亦可將論文集
錄製成光碟片以方便攜帶；論文集附錄必須有 Author Index，Subject 
Index 等以方便聆聽場次之選擇及論文之查閱；與會交通之安排；會前
會後旅遊活動之安排；眷屬活動之安排等等，皆需細心之規劃。 
 3.會議地點應可考慮觀光地點之大飯店，同時事前設法議取誘人之
價格，以方便國外學者攜眷前來。 同時會議住宿之安排必須非常細心，
例如：住宿地點與會議場地間之交通，住宿地之餐飲問題等等。若可能，
住宿地點與會議場地同一且屬五星級飯店價格低廉，即是一優質組合。

業大學機械系之 Prof. Kishimoto 共同承辦，地點在本系(成大航太系)，
當時台日雙方各約 40 餘人參與。 第二次輪由日本東京工業大學、東北
大學與台灣大學共同承辦，我方因日本交流協會之補助限制，無法達到
第一次 40 餘位教授參與之盛況，僅只 10 位教授參與，日方亦相對配合
約 10 餘位教授參與，雖規模不如第一次，雙方關係確實因接連 2 次之
研討會而更加熟識，也因此促成爾後數件國際合作案與雙方教授與學生
之交流互訪，亦有許多研究成果共同發表於國際著名期刊，將這些成果
歸功於雙邊研討會應屬恰當。 由於前兩次會議之成功更加促成此一雙
邊會議之持續性，第三次移至台灣時亦有超過 50 餘位之台日教授參與。 
而今第 4 次移至東京近郊之渡假勝地箱根，由於主辦單位挑選之會議地
點為渡假勝地內之偏遠寧靜地區，交通不是很方便，卻也因此讓雙方教
授有更多在一起討論問題的時間，確實是一促進交流之絕佳地點。  
由於此系列的會議為台日雙邊會議，參與成員僅台日兩國之教授，
沒有其他國家之教授參與，同時此一會議以邀請演講的性質為主(除個別
邀請外僅在國科會航太學門做短暫之公告，期望吸引一些較年輕的學者
參與)，因此台灣部份參與發表論文之學者比在台舉辦時少，約 20 位，
加上日方相對應之人數，整體合計近 50 位參與此次之研討會。 雖會議
主題「機械與航空」為通泛之名稱，實際議程以固力與流力之主題分二
個場次進行演講與討論。 
這次會議我個人除發表論文外亦主持一個與非破壞檢測相關之場
次，而我所發表之論文為: Green’s Functions for Unsymmetric Composite 
Laminates with Holes/Cracks/Inclusions。 此一論文為我個人近幾年完成
與 Stretching-Bending Analysis 相關成果之整合報告，希望藉此場合讓日
方學者知道我近幾年之研究成果。 只可惜發表完後並無日籍學者發
問，倒是有許多我們自己台灣之教授發問。 
除發表論文外，依往例總會有歡迎餐會及會議晚宴，分別有日本交
流協會及台灣駐日經濟代表處科學組兩支助單位之代表出席說些他們
的期許及他們所見到此一活動所達成之交流成果。 由於我個人是此一
會議第一屆之承辦人，我亦於晚宴中介紹此會之沿革，好讓初次參與者
有所瞭解，同時也期許參與之教授多多利用此一難得之機會與日方教授
交流及學習。 
 43
可以聽得較為清楚，幾乎每篇發表完後，在場都有許多學者發問討論，
討論的程度確實比一般國際會議來得熱烈。 
除會議發表論文之外，也因會議關係與部份日籍教授討論許多未來
可能合作之研究方向，尤其是與好友 Prof. Kishimoto，在討論期間得知
他近期升任東京工業大學工學院副院長，同時亦將於明年接任一國際期
刊之主編，頗為他感到驕傲，而他也主動邀請我成為他所負責期刊之編
輯委員，我個人則覺得這應是雙邊會議促成之交流活動，對未來之學術
合作應有絕對之幫助。   
由於我個人已充分感受到雙邊會議對我的幫助，因此也很希望國內
年輕教授能多多參與此一類型之會議，以協助他們深入瞭解另一國度之
研究學者。 
 
 
建議： 
 
由於此次會議之地點為東京近郊渡假勝地(箱根)內之偏遠寧靜地區
(箱根園，晚上 5:00 過後旅館周邊幾乎沒有任何商業活動，也幾乎沒有
燈光，大部份地方是一遍漆黑)，交通不是很方便(由東京機場到旅館約
需 5 小時)，卻也因此讓雙方教授有更多在一起討論問題的時間，確實是
一促進交流之絕佳地點。 爾後輪由台灣舉辦時，亦可考慮安排類似之
渡假勝地，以達成促進學術交流之目的。

Based upon the comprehensive model described in (1), to embed the concept of finite element formulation we 
now consider Hamilton’s principle [6] as shown by the following equation: 
( )2

t
dtδ π κ− =∫                                                                        (2) 
where π is potential energy consisting of strain energy and the work done by the body forces, and κ is the kinetic 
energy which may be neglected for the study of aeroelastic divergence. By following the standard procedure of 
finite element formulation and using the aerodynamic strip theory to approximate the lift and moment of wing 
structures, the governing equation for each element of the wing structures can be written as  
e e aero=K u f                                                                            (3) 
where Ke is the element structural stiffness matrix, ue is the nodal displacement vector, and faero is the 
aerodynamic force vector. As a result of structure mechanics coupled with aerodynamics, the aerodynamic forces 
are functions of displacements, and hence, equation (3) can be re-written into a standard eigenvalue problem such 
as 
fe e n e eq=K u K u                                                                        (4) 
where 
feK is the element stiffness matrix induced by aerodynamics and qn is the divergence dynamic pressure. 
3 NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section, we will first check our solutions by comparison with the existing numerical solutions for the 
uniform wing structure (without taper) evaluated by Weisshaar, T. A. [7]. The numerical results of improved 
comprehensive model agree well with the existing solutions as shown in Fig.1. The divergence dynamic pressures 
calculated by the present model converge rapidly with a few elements as shown in Fig.2. After the checks are 
done, we will study the tapered effect on the divergence analysis.

 inconvenient when employing the Green’s function as a fundamental solution of the boundary 
element formulation to solve more practical engineering problems. To improve Becker’s 
solution, Hwu (2004) found an explicit analytical closed form Green’s function through the 
use of Stroh-like formalism for stretching-bending coupling analysis (Lu and Mahrenholtz, 
1994; Cheng and Reddy, 2002; Hwu, 2003; Yin, 2003a,b).  
 
As to the Green’s functions of holes/cracks in infinite laminates, most of the Green’s 
functions presented in the literature are for two-dimensional problems or pure bending 
problems (Lekhnitskii, 1968; Ting, 1996), and very few Green’s functions have been found in 
closed-form for the coupled stretching-bending analysis. Based upon the non-hole Green’s 
functions and through the use of analytical continuation method, recently the Green’s 
functions for holes in unsymmetric laminates are obtained in explicit closed-form for the 
complete loading cases (Hwu, 2005). The Green’s functions for cracks are then obtained by 
letting the minor axis of ellipse be zero (Hwu, 2006).  
 
By following the steps of non-hole, hole and crack problems, the Green’s functions for elastic 
inclusions in composite laminates are also obtained recently by employing Stroh-like 
formalism (Hwu and Tan, 2007). The generality of the obtained Green’s functions can be 
shown as follows: (1) The laminates include any kinds of laminate lay-ups, symmetric or 
unsymmetric, which allow the stretching and bending deformations couple each other. (2) The 
concentrated forces and moments can be applied in in-plane and/or out-of-plane directions, 
located inside and/or outside the inclusions. (3) The elliptical elastic inclusions can be any 
kinds of elastic materials including the limiting cases such as holes, rigid inclusions, cracks, 
line inclusions, etc. The Green’s functions for inclusions are so general that they may cover all 
the previous solutions found for the non-hole and hole/crack problems.  
 
It should be noted that all the Green’s functions for holes/cracks/inclusions in infinite 
laminates with stretching-bending coupling subjected to the in-plane concentrated forces and 
out-of-plane concentrated moments have exactly the same mathematical form as those of the 
corresponding two-dimensional problems, in which the only difference is the contents of the 
symbols. While for the other loading cases such as inplane torsions and transverse forces 
which play important roles in the laminate plate theory, their solution forms are different from 
those of the corresponding two-dimensional problems (Hwu, 2004; 2005; Hwu and Tan, 
2007). 
 
2. STROH-LIKE FORMALISM  
 
Basic Equations 
 
To describe the overall properties and macromechanical behavior of a composite laminate, the 
most popular way is the classical lamination theory (Jones, 1974). According to the 
observation of actual mechanical behavior of laminates, the Kirchhoff’s assumptions are 
usually made for the displacement fields, i.e., the laminate displacements 1U , 2U  and 3U  in 
the 21 , xx  and 3x  directions are assumed to be

GREEN’S FUNCTION FOR INFINITE LAMINATES 
 
Consider an infinite laminate subjected to a concentrated force )ˆ,ˆ,ˆ(ˆ 321 fff=f  and moment 
)ˆ,ˆ,ˆ(ˆ 321 mmm=m  at point )ˆ,ˆ(ˆ 21 xx=x . The elasticity solution of this problem can be used as 
a fundamental solution of boundary element method and is generally called Green’s function. 
The boundary conditions stating the concentrated forces and moments have been shown in 
(2.11). To find a solution satisfying the conditions (2.11), the choice of )(zf  in the general 
solutions (2.3) is very critical in the solution procedures. Equations (2.11) show that the stress 
functions 121 ,, ψφφ  and 2ψ  should be multi-valued functions if the concentrated forces 21 ˆ,ˆ ff  
and moments 21 ˆ,ˆ mm  are applied, whereas )2/( ,kkψη =  and )( 12dx∫=Φ φ  should be multi-
valued functions if the concentrated forces 3ˆf  and moments 3mˆ  are applied. However, no 
matter which kind of force conditions are considered, the physical quantities such as the 
displacements and slopes should always be single-valued to confirm that the laminates will 
not break off when deformed. Since iφ  (or iψ ), kk ,ψ  and 12dx∫φ  stand for three different 
function status, in the followings the force conditions are all separated into three cases, i.e., (1) 
21
ˆ,ˆ ff , 21 ˆ,ˆ mm ; (2) 3ˆf ; (3) 3mˆ .  
 
With proper selection of )(zf , through satisfaction of boundary conditions (2.11), the 
unknown complex function vector )(zf  of (2.3) has been determined to be (Hwu, 2004)

As to the Green’s functions for laminates containing cracks, solutions can be obtained from 
(4.4) and (4.5) by letting the minor axis 2b of the ellipse be equal to zero. The final simplified 
solutions and related discussions can be found in (Hwu, 2006).  
 
GREEN’S FUNCTION FOR ELASTIC INCLUSIONS IN LAMINATES 
 
Consider an infinite composite laminate containing an elliptical inclusion subjected to a

represented by (4.1). The inclusion and the matrix (the laminates) are assumed to be perfectly 
bonded along the interface, and hence the displacements and surface tractions across the 
interface should be continuous. The continuity condition can be expressed by (2.8b).  
 
Similar to the hole problems, to find a suitable function satisfying the boundary conditions 
around the elliptical inclusion the transformation function (4.3) is a proper choice for the 
function expressions. Different from the hole problems, we should now note that although the 
transformation (4.3) will map the points outside the elliptic inclusion into the points outside 
the unit circle in αζ -domain, the points inside the elliptic inclusion will be mapped to two

~or called nonhole problems! @18# for the complete loading cases.
As in the two-dimensional problems, by the method of analytical
Ni152f i ,2 , Ni25f i ,1 ,continuation it seems that use of Green’s functions for nonhole
problems may help us to obtain Green’s functions for hole prob-
lems. As in the Green’s function for the nonhole problem @18#,
there are three different loading cases that should be of concern
for the present problem, and two of them have different outlooks
from that of two-dimensional problems. Careful derivation, such
as the selection of the unperturbed functions for the method of
analytical continuation, becomes important for the present study.
All the works that are different from the two-dimensional math-
ematical routine derivations will be discussed in detail in this
paper.

Bending Analysis
Based upon the Kirchhoff’s assumptions for thin plate, the ki-

the coupled stretching-bending analysis of composite laminates

In the above, the subscript comma stands for differentiation: u1 ,

x3 directions, respectively; b i , i51, 2 are the negative of the
slope of the middle surface; « i j and k i j denote the midplane strain
and plate curvature; Ni j , M i j , and Qi denote the stress resultants,
bending moments, and shear forces, respectively; Ai jkl , Bi jkl , and

stiffness tensors; q is the lateral distributed load applied on the
laminates. Repeated indices imply summation.
A general solution satisfying all the basic equations stated in
Eqs. ~2.1! has been obtained @11# and purposely arranged in the
form of a Stroh formalism @5,19# of two-dimensional anisotropic
elasticity, and hence is called a Stroh-like formalism. With this
formalism, the solution fields of displacements and stresses are
expressed as @11#

f a(za), a51, 2, 3, 4, are four holomorphic functions of complex
variables za , which will be determined by the boundary condi-
tions set for each particular problem. ma and (aa ,ba) are, respec-
tively, the material eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which can be
determined by the following eigenrelation:

where N is a 838 real matrix and j is a 831 column vector
defined by
N5FN1 N2N3 N1TG , j5 H abJ . (2.4b)
The superscript T denotes the transpose of a matrix. The subma-
trices N1 , N2 and N3 are the fundamental matrices of elasticity
related to the extensional, coupling, and bending stiffness tensors,
respectively. The detailed definitions of Ni for the coupled
stretching-bending problems have been given in Refs. @11#, @18#
which are little different from those of two-dimensional problems
@5#. Moreover, the explicit expressions of N1 , N2 and N3 as well
as their associated eigenvectors a and b have been found in Refs.
@11#, @20#.

Nn , Ns , Nns , bending moments M n , M s , M ns , shear forces Qn ,

or simply, points at infinity. By Liouville’s theorem we have u~z![constant.
However, the constant function corresponds to rigid body motion,fd50, along the hole boundary. (4.4b)
Since the elliptical hole boundary in the z-plane will map to
four different slanted elliptical hole boundaries in the za-plane, it
is not convenient to solve problems with an elliptical boundary by
using the argument za defined in Eq. ~2.2c!. Therefore, to treat the
problems with an elliptical boundary, most of the solutions shown
in the literature are expressed in terms of the transformed complex
variable za , which can transform all four different slanted ellip-
tical hole boundaries into the same hole boundary in the shape of
a unit circle uzu51. The relation between za and za is

Substituting Eq. ~4.1! and Eq. ~2.2c!2 into Eq. ~4.5b!, we have
za5cos c1i sin c5eic5s , along the hole boundary.
(4.6)
Using the method of analytical continuation and understanding
that the unknown complex function vector f(z) is better expressed
in terms of the arguments za , the general solution ~2.2! for the
present problem can now be written as
ud52 Re$A@fu~z!1fp~z!#%, fd52 Re$B@fu~z!1fp~z!#%,
(4.7)
where fu is the function associated with the unperturbed elastic
field and fp is the holomorphic function corresponding to the per-
turbed field of the problem and will be determined through satis-
faction of the boundary conditions. To solve fp , we first need to
have a proper choice for fu . If some parts of fu are holomorphic
outside the hole (S1) while others are holomorphic inside the
hole (S2), we may split fu into two functions fu1 and fu2 ; i.e.,
fu~z!5fu
1~z!1fu
2~z!, (4.8)
where fu
1 is holomorphic in S1 and fu
2 is holomorphic in S2.
Employing the general solution ~4.7! and the relation ~4.8!, the
traction-free boundary condition ~4.4b! now becomes
B@fu
1~s!1fu
2~s!1fp~s!#1B¯ @fu
1~s!1fu
2~s!1fp~s!#50,
(4.9)
which can also be written as
Bfu
1~s!1Bfp~s!1B¯fu
2~s!52Bfu
2~s!2B¯fu
1~s!2B¯ fp~s!.
(4.10)
One of the important properties of holomorphic functions used in
the analytical continuation method is that if f (z) is holomorphic
outside the unit circle S1 then f (1/z¯ ) will be holomorphic inside
the unit circle S2, and vice versa. With this background, Eq.
~4.10! can be rewritten as
u~s1!5u~s2!, (4.11a)
where
u~z!5H Bfu1~z!1Bfp~z!1B¯fu2~1/z¯ !, zPS1,
2Bfu
2~z!2B¯fu
1~1/z¯ !2B¯ fp~1/z¯ !, zPS
2
.
(4.11b)
By the holomorphic conditions discussed before this equation, we
conclude that this newly defined function u~z! will be holomor-
phic in S1 and S2, and is continuous across the unit circle. This
means that u~z! is holomorphic in the whole z-plane, including the
Journal of Applied Mechanicswhich may be neglected. Therefore, u~z![0. With this result, Eq.
~4.11b!1 leads to
fp~z!52fu
1~z!2B21B¯fu
2~1/z¯ !. (4.12)
Note that when employing the method of analytical continuation,
the subscript a of za has been dropped in Eq. ~4.12! and a re-
placement of z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 should be made for each component
function of fp(z) after the multiplication of matrices ~see Appen-
dix for detailed explanation!.
The problem now becomes how to select an appropriate unper-
turbed solution fu and split it into fu
1 and fu
2
, and then use Eq.
~4.12! to get fp . Following are the discussions based upon the
Green’s functions of nonhole problems provided in Sec. 3, which
are presented in three different loading cases.
Case 1: fˆ 1 , fˆ 2 , mˆ1 , mˆ2
In order to save the effort of considering the force equilibrium
and single-valued requirement caused by the concentrated forces
and moments, it is appropriate to select fu to be the solution for
the nonhole problems; i.e., the solution given in Eq. ~3.2a!. From
Eq. ~4.5a! we know that

into Eq. ~3.2a! and get

(4.14)
Knowing that uga /(zˆ aza)u,1 when zaPS1 and uza /zˆ au,1
when zaPS2, we may split fu of Eq. ~4.14! into the following
two parts:

Stress Resultants and Moments Along the Hole Boundary.
In engineering applications, one is usually interested in the stress
resultants and moments along the hole boundary. Since the hole
considered in this paper is in the shape of an ellipse, it is better to
calculate the stress resultants and bending moments in the
tangent–normal (s – n) coordinate instead of the Cartesian
(x1 – x2) coordinate. By the relations given in Eqs. ~2.5! and
~2.2b!2 , we know that the calculation of stress resultants and mo-
ments relies upon the calculation of the differentials fd ,s and
fd ,n . Moreover, due to the traction-free boundary condition pre-
scribed in Eq. ~4.4!, along the hole boundary fd ,s should be zero,
which will then be used as a check of our solutions.
From ~2.2a!2 , we have
fd ,n52 Re$Bf,n~z!%, (4.29)

This identity is just one of several useful identities developed in
Stroh formalism for two-dimensional problems @5#. By deliberate
arrangement it has been proved that these identities are still valid
for Stroh-like formalism of coupled stretching-bending problems
@11#.
Discussion and Verification. Although the Green’s functions
for hole problems play important roles in stress analysis, most of
the closed-form solutions presented in the literature are for two-
dimensional problems. As to the holes in laminates with
stretching-bending coupling, as far as I know no analytical closed-
form solution has been presented in complete loading cases with-
out leaving any unsolved coefficients. Since no other analytical
solutions can be used to compare our solutions, detailed discus-
sion and verification are necessary. When we employed the gen-
eral solution ~2.2!, all the basic equations for the laminates with
stretching-bending coupling have been satisfied. Thus, all we need
to do is check the satisfaction of the boundary conditions pre-
scribed in Eqs. ~3.1a,b,c! and Eq. ~4.4!. By the method of analyti-
cal continuation, when we selected the nonhole solutions
~3.2a,b,c! as our unperturbed solutions fu , the boundary condi-
tions ~3.1a,b,c! have been satisfied. Moreover, the perturbed solu-
tions fp obtained in Eqs. ~4.17!, ~4.23!, and ~4.27! are all holomor-
phic in the region outside the hole, and hence will make all the

has recently attracted much interest. The primary purpose of the
MAV currently is surveillance, which requires a slow flight and
excellent maneuverability. Early models of rubber powered or-
nithopters were successful built by Alphonse Penaud [1]. This
has been the prototype for many ornithopter models later built
as toys. Despite of the flapping wing design, the aerodynamic
behaviors of these ornithopters are quite different to those of
birds in the cruising flight. The flapping wing of Penaud’s or-
nithopter is constructed by a stiff leading-edge spar and some
flexible ribs attached to the spar. The wing skeleton is covered
with a thin sheet of flexible material. This design results in a
light flexible membrane wing that may twist and bend during
the flapping motion. This study constructs mechanical mem-
brane flapping wings using carbon fiber reinforced epoxy as the
skeleton. A four-bar linkage driven by an electric motor was
used as the flapping mechanism. The wing surface was formed
by covering the skeleton with thin plastic film. Wind tunnel tests
were performed to measure the lift and thrust of the mechanical
membrane flapping wing under different frequency, speed, and
angle of attack.
2. Wing design and kinematics
A four-bar linkage design was selected as the mechanism
for the wing flapping as shown in Fig. 1. The linkage OA is the
driving linkage and the linkage BD is connected to the wing
structure. The design of the four-bar linkage is a kind of the
Crank and Rocker mechanism where the driving linkage can
rotate a revolution completely and the following linkage un-
dergoes a rocking motion. The Crank and Rocker mechanism
follows some constraints for the member lengths as
OA + AB + BD > OD, (1)
OA + OD + BD > AB, (2)
OA + AB − BD < OD, (3)
AB − OA + BD > OD. (4)
If the angular speed of the driving linkage is ω2, the angular
velocities of the connecting and following linkages can be ex-
pressed as

3. Experimental
The selected lengths for each linkages are OA = 8.5 mm,
AB = 31.5 mm, BD = 19 mm, and OD = 30.5 mm. The result-
ing flapping angle for the wing is shown in Fig. 2. The upward
flapping angle is about 39 degree and the downward flapping is
about 18 degree. In the early stage of the design, several tests
were performed to investigate the effect of the flapping upward
and downward strokes on the lift force. It was found that large
upward angle stroke or larger downward angle stroke do not af-
fect the lift force. In this design, we have a larger upward angle
stroke.Fig. 2. Flapping angle with respect to the position angle of the driving linkage.

1. Introduction
On account of the linear character of the related equations, the principle of superposition is applicable to
most of the fundamental problems of elasticity. Thus, the solutions associated with the concentrated forces

Abstract
The problems of composite laminates containing elliptical elastic inclusions subjected to concentrated forces and
moments are considered in this paper. By employing Stroh-like formalism for the coupled stretching–bending analysis,
analytical closed form solutions are obtained explicitly. The generality of the solutions provided in this paper can be shown
as follows: (1) The laminates include any kinds of laminate lay-ups, symmetric or unsymmetric, which allow the stretching
and bending deformations couple each other. (2) The concentrated forces and moments can be applied in in-plane and/or
out-of-plane directions, located inside and/or outside the inclusions. (3) The elliptical elastic inclusions can be any kinds of
elastic materials including the limiting cases such as holes, rigid inclusions, cracks, line inclusions, etc. Since no such gen-
eral solution has been found in the literature, the solutions are checked and veriﬁed by the special cases that no inclusions
are embedded in the laminates, and that the inclusions are replaced by holes. Moreover, with various hardness ratios of
inclusion and matrix some numerical examples showing the stress resultants along the interface are presented. Like the
Green’s functions for the inﬁnite laminates and those containing holes/cracks, the present solutions associated with the
in-plane concentrated forces and out-of-plane concentrated moments have exactly the same mathematical form as those
of the corresponding two-dimensional problems, in which the only diﬀerence is the contents of the symbols. While for
the other loading cases, new types of solutions are obtained explicitly.In-plane/out-of-plane concentrated forces and moments

If the matrix and the inclusion are composed of the same material, the material eigenvector matrices should
be identical, and hence we can set A1 = A2 = A and B1 = B2 = B. Thus, from (5.13c) we have M1 =M2 =M.
From the identities shown in (Ting, 1996), we know that the impedance matrix M is related to the Stroh fun-
damental matrices H, S and L, which are real matrices, by
M ¼ H1ðIþ iSÞ; H ¼ 2iAAT; S ¼ ið2ABT  IÞ: ð7:1Þ
By using the above relations, the coeﬃcient vector ck and the function vector f

Case 2.numerical results for various elastic inclusions. Since no analytical solution has been presented in the literature
for the general cases discussed in this paper, to check the correctness of our derivation we consider: (1) the
simplest condition that the matrix and the inclusion are composed of the same materials, i.e., no inclusions
are embedded in the laminates; (2) the case that the inclusion is very soft, which can be checked by the results
of corresponding hole problems. The analytical solutions of these two special cases can be found in (Hwu,
2004) and (Hwu, 2005).nalytical veriﬁcation with some special cases reduced from our general solutions, and then present theLiang, 2006). Like the two-dimensional problems, the eﬃciency and accuracy of this special boundary element
over the general ﬁnite element can then be expected.
Due to the inappropriateness of numerical check by ﬁnite element method, in this paper we ﬁrst considers/inclusions has been developed based upon the associated Green’s function, and several numerical
ples have also been done and compared (Hwu and Liao, 1994). Following this concept, a special bound-
ement for the coupled stretching–bending analysis of holes/cracks/inclusions will be developed (Hwu andBased upon this solution, we may construct the solutions for any complete problem whose boundary is pre-
scribed by tractions or displacements and all applied forces and reactive forces are in equilibrium condition. In
other words, the complete problem may be solved through superposition of several Green’s function with dif-
ferent intensities located at diﬀerent points. That is why the Green’s function is sometimes called the funda-
mental solution for the boundary element method. Therefore, in this stage it is not appropriate to compare our
solutions with those obtained from the other numerical methods such as the ﬁnite element method since they
can only deal with complete problems. For two-dimensional problems, a special boundary element for holes/om the statements and the solutions given in the previous sections, we know that Green’s function is a

6604 C. Hwu, C.J. Tan / International Journal of Solids and Structures 44 (2007) 6584–6606The analytical closed form solutions for composite laminates with elliptical elastic inclusions subjected to
in-plane/out-of-plane concentrated forces and moments are obtained in this paper through the use of Stroh-
like formalism and the method of analytical continuation. These solutions can be classiﬁed into six categoriessee the eﬀect of elliptic shape and the singular behavior near the crack tip, a series of numerical data for the
hoop stress resultant at x = 0 are shown in Fig. 4. A nearly constant value of the hoop stress resultant for
b! 0 is achieved when the inclusion is not a hole, which means that no singular behavior occurs for the gen-
eral elastic inclusions. For elliptical holes, singular behavior occurs when b! 0 which is expected for cracks.

810by three diﬀerent loading types and two diﬀerent loading locations. They are: (case 1) inplane concentrated
forces f^ 1; f^ 2 and out-of-plane concentrated moments m^1; m^2, (case 2) out-of-plane concentrated force f^ 3,
and (case 3) in-plane torsion m^3, which may locate outside the inclusion or inside the inclusion. Among these
solutions, the one corresponding to the loading type of case 1 applied outside the inclusions is the most famil-
iar solution since it has exactly the same mathematical form as that of the corresponding two-dimensional
problems. Moreover, no special diﬃculty has been encountered for this condition than that of hole/crack
problems. For the loads applied inside the inclusions, special treatment given in (4.4) and (4.5) is necessary
to avoid discontinuity raised by the requirement of one-to-one transformation. To solve the problems under
the loading types of cases 2 and 3, the key step that lead us to the solutions is splitting the unperturbed solu-
tion into three parts like those shown in (4.6) where the ﬁrst one is holomorphic outside the unit circle, the
second one is holomorphic inside the unit circle, and the third one is singular in both region. With the solu-
tions provided in this paper, analytical solutions for any arbitrary loading can be obtained through superpo-
sition. Moreover, these solutions can serve as the fundamental solutions for boundary element formulation
and as the kernel functions for the integral equations considering the interaction between inclusions and
cracks. Moreover, they will also be useful for the study of homogenized elastic constitutive properties of elastic
solids with micro-inclusions, voids and cracks.

such a structure can be obtained by classical continuum mechanics (Zhang et al. [10]; Xiao et al. [11]; 
Li and Chou [12, 13]) or finite element method (Tserpes and Papanikos [14], Kirtania and 
Chakraborty [15], Jalalahmadi and Naghdabadi [16]). However, due to the uncertainty of the CNT 
wall thickness for both of the above modeling techniques, the obtained mechanical properties of 
SWNTs or MWNTs have scattered values, for example, as summarized in [16], the axial Young’s 
modulus ranging from about 1.0 TPa to 5.5 TPa can be found in the existing literature. 
In our previous study [17], we have successfully developed a finite element (FE) model of SWNTs 
and consequently estimated their axial Young’s modulus. The approach is based on the fact that the 
carbon nanotube can be treated as a frame-like structure, and the primary bonds between two 
nearest-neighboring atoms can be modeled as beam elements in view of the concept of finite element 
method. Moreover, we adjust the modeling work to be suitably implemented by the finite element 
commercial code ANSYS to save the effort of program coding and make this approach more 
convenient and efficient. In this paper, we will extend the use of the model to estimate the other 
mechanical properties of SWNTs and re-evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed 
approach. 
Finite Element Modeling 
As mentioned above, CNTs can be treated as a frame-like structure with their bonds as beam members 
and carbon atoms as joints. To establish the linkage between the force constants in molecular 
mechanics and the beam element stiffness in structural mechanics, the energy equivalence concept 
proposed by Li and Chou [12] is employed. Table 1 summarizes various energy forms for the two 
mechanical systems.

Fig. 2 displays the computed axial and radial Young’s moduli of both zigzag and armchair SWNTs 
with different tube diameters, and the axial Young’s moduli obtained by Li and Chou [12] is also 
plotted for comparison. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that the trend is similar for both zigzag and 
armchair SWNT, and with increasing tube diameter, the Young’s moduli of zigzag SWNTs increase 
slightly faster than those of armchair SWNTs.

Shear Moduli. To simulate a pure torsion condition of SWNTs, we apply tangent forces at one end 
and the other is fixed. Then the shear moduli can be obtained by the relationship between the applied 
torque and the corresponding torsional angle. Fig. 3 shows the results of shear moduli versus the tube 
diameter, it illustrates that the trend of the shear moduli is similar to that of the Young’s moduli, and 
the convergent value is about 0.5 TPa which is closed to most of the results found in the existing 
literature.

Buckling Loads. In the buckling analysis of SWNTs, we investigate the buckling loads of the 
zigzag (5, 0) and armchair (3, 3) which have the same diameter with different aspect ratios L/d, where 
L and d are respectively the length and diameter of the tube. Under the boundary condition that one 
end is fixed, the results of the FE analysis are displayed in Fig. 4. In addition, the results obtained by 
Li and Chou [13] as well as the theoretical solution of the buckling load Pcr for a cylindrical shell, 
which can be represented as 2 2/ 4crP EI Lπ=  where the axial Young’s modulus of the tube E is chosen 
to be the estimated value obtained in the previous section and I is the moment inertia, are also plotted. 
From Fig. 4, it can be observed that the buckling load decreases as the aspect ratio increases, and the 
shapes of curves for zigzag and armchair nanotubes are almost coincident. Moreover, all the 
numerical and theoretical results gradually agree with each other at the aspect ratio larger than 6.

辦，地點在本系(成大航太系)，當時台日雙方各約 40餘人參與。 第二次輪由日
本東京工業大學、東北大學與台灣大學共同承辦，我方因日本交流協會之補助
限制，無法達到第一次 40 餘位教授參與之盛況，僅只 10 位教授參與，日方亦
相對配合約 10餘位教授參與，雖規模不如第一次，雙方關係確實因接連 2次之
研討會而更加熟識，也因此促成爾後數件國際合作案與雙方教授與學生之交流
互訪，亦有許多研究成果共同發表於國際著名期刊，將這些成果歸功於雙邊研
討會應屬恰當。 由於前兩次會議之成功更加促成此一雙邊會議之持續性，第三
次移至台灣時亦有超過 50 餘位之台日教授參與。 而今第 4 次移至東京近郊之
渡假勝地箱根，由於主辦單位挑選之會議地點為渡假勝地內之偏遠寧靜地區，
交通不是很方便，卻也因此讓雙方教授有更多在一起討論問題的時間，確實是
一促進交流之絕佳地點。  
由於此系列的會議為台日雙邊會議，參與成員僅台日兩國之教授，沒有其他
國家之教授參與，同時此一會議以邀請演講的性質為主(除個別邀請外僅在國科
會航太學門做短暫之公告，期望吸引一些較年輕的學者參與)，因此台灣部份參
與發表論文之學者比在台舉辦時少，約 20位，加上日方相對應之人數，整體合
計近 50 位參與此次之研討會。 雖會議主題「機械與航空」為通泛之名稱，實
際議程以固力與流力之主題分二個場次進行演講與討論。 
這次會議我個人除發表論文外亦主持一個與非破壞檢測相關之場次，而我所
發表之論文為: Green’s Functions for Unsymmetric Composite Laminates with 
Holes/Cracks/Inclusions。 此一論文為我個人近幾年完成與 Stretching-Bending 
Analysis相關成果之整合報告，希望藉此場合讓日方學者知道我近幾年之研究成
果。 只可惜發表完後並無日籍學者發問，倒是有許多我們自己台灣之教授發問。 
除發表論文外，依往例總會有歡迎餐會及會議晚宴，分別有日本交流協會及
台灣駐日經濟代表處科學組兩支助單位之代表出席說些他們的期許及他們所見
到此一活動所達成之交流成果。 由於我個人是此一會議第一屆之承辦人，我亦
於晚宴中介紹此會之沿革，好讓初次參與者有所瞭解，同時也期許參與之教授
多多利用此一難得之機會與日方教授交流及學習。

 inconvenient when employing the Green’s function as a fundamental solution of the boundary 
element formulation to solve more practical engineering problems. To improve Becker’s 
solution, Hwu (2004) found an explicit analytical closed form Green’s function through the 
use of Stroh-like formalism for stretching-bending coupling analysis (Lu and Mahrenholtz, 
1994; Cheng and Reddy, 2002; Hwu, 2003; Yin, 2003a,b).  
 
As to the Green’s functions of holes/cracks in infinite laminates, most of the Green’s 
functions presented in the literature are for two-dimensional problems or pure bending 
problems (Lekhnitskii, 1968; Ting, 1996), and very few Green’s functions have been found in 
closed-form for the coupled stretching-bending analysis. Based upon the non-hole Green’s 
functions and through the use of analytical continuation method, recently the Green’s 
functions for holes in unsymmetric laminates are obtained in explicit closed-form for the 
complete loading cases (Hwu, 2005). The Green’s functions for cracks are then obtained by 
letting the minor axis of ellipse be zero (Hwu, 2006).  
 
By following the steps of non-hole, hole and crack problems, the Green’s functions for elastic 
inclusions in composite laminates are also obtained recently by employing Stroh-like 
formalism (Hwu and Tan, 2007). The generality of the obtained Green’s functions can be 
shown as follows: (1) The laminates include any kinds of laminate lay-ups, symmetric or 
unsymmetric, which allow the stretching and bending deformations couple each other. (2) The 
concentrated forces and moments can be applied in in-plane and/or out-of-plane directions, 
located inside and/or outside the inclusions. (3) The elliptical elastic inclusions can be any 
kinds of elastic materials including the limiting cases such as holes, rigid inclusions, cracks, 
line inclusions, etc. The Green’s functions for inclusions are so general that they may cover all 
the previous solutions found for the non-hole and hole/crack problems.  
 
It should be noted that all the Green’s functions for holes/cracks/inclusions in infinite 
laminates with stretching-bending coupling subjected to the in-plane concentrated forces and 
out-of-plane concentrated moments have exactly the same mathematical form as those of the 
corresponding two-dimensional problems, in which the only difference is the contents of the 
symbols. While for the other loading cases such as inplane torsions and transverse forces 
which play important roles in the laminate plate theory, their solution forms are different from 
those of the corresponding two-dimensional problems (Hwu, 2004; 2005; Hwu and Tan, 
2007). 
 
2. STROH-LIKE FORMALISM  
 
Basic Equations 
 
To describe the overall properties and macromechanical behavior of a composite laminate, the 
most popular way is the classical lamination theory (Jones, 1974). According to the 
observation of actual mechanical behavior of laminates, the Kirchhoff’s assumptions are 
usually made for the displacement fields, i.e., the laminate displacements 1U , 2U  and 3U  in 
the 21 , xx  and 3x  directions are assumed to be

equilibrium (2.10) and the single-valued requirement of displacements and slopes, the 
boundary conditions stating the concentrated forces and moments can then be expressed in

GREEN’S FUNCTION FOR INFINITE LAMINATES 
 
Consider an infinite laminate subjected to a concentrated force )ˆ,ˆ,ˆ(ˆ 321 fff=f  and moment 
)ˆ,ˆ,ˆ(ˆ 321 mmm=m  at point )ˆ,ˆ(ˆ 21 xx=x . The elasticity solution of this problem can be used as 
a fundamental solution of boundary element method and is generally called Green’s function. 
The boundary conditions stating the concentrated forces and moments have been shown in 
(2.11). To find a solution satisfying the conditions (2.11), the choice of )(zf  in the general 
solutions (2.3) is very critical in the solution procedures. Equations (2.11) show that the stress 
functions 121 ,, ψφφ  and 2ψ  should be multi-valued functions if the concentrated forces 21 ˆ,ˆ ff  
and moments 21 ˆ,ˆ mm  are applied, whereas )2/( ,kkψη =  and )( 12dx∫=Φ φ  should be multi-
valued functions if the concentrated forces 3ˆf  and moments 3mˆ  are applied. However, no 
matter which kind of force conditions are considered, the physical quantities such as the 
displacements and slopes should always be single-valued to confirm that the laminates will 
not break off when deformed. Since iφ  (or iψ ), kk ,ψ  and 12dx∫φ  stand for three different 
function status, in the followings the force conditions are all separated into three cases, i.e., (1) 
21
ˆ,ˆ ff , 21 ˆ,ˆ mm ; (2) 3ˆf ; (3) 3mˆ .  
 
With proper selection of )(zf , through satisfaction of boundary conditions (2.11), the 
unknown complex function vector )(zf  of (2.3) has been determined to be (Hwu, 2004)

As to the Green’s functions for laminates containing cracks, solutions can be obtained from 
(4.4) and (4.5) by letting the minor axis 2b of the ellipse be equal to zero. The final simplified 
solutions and related discussions can be found in (Hwu, 2006).  
 
GREEN’S FUNCTION FOR ELASTIC INCLUSIONS IN LAMINATES 
 
Consider an infinite composite laminate containing an elliptical inclusion subjected to a 
concentrated force fˆ  and moment mˆ  at point xˆ . The contour of the inclusion boundary is 
represented by (4.1). The inclusion and the matrix (the laminates) are assumed to be perfectly 
bonded along the interface, and hence the displacements and surface tractions across the 
interface should be continuous. The continuity condition can be expressed by (2.8b).  
 
Similar to the hole problems, to find a suitable function satisfying the boundary conditions 
around the elliptical inclusion the transformation function (4.3) is a proper choice for the 
function expressions. Different from the hole problems, we should now note that although the 
transformation (4.3) will map the points outside the elliptic inclusion into the points outside 
the unit circle in αζ -domain, the points inside the elliptic inclusion will be mapped to two
