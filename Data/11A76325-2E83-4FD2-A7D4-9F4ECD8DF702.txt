Abstract 
The Ti/APC-2 cross-ply nanocomposite laminates were successfully fabricated. The Ti thin 
sheets were surface treated by anodic oxidation to achieve good bonding with APC-2 laminates, 
instead of chemical etching method used for Mg/APC-2 and Al/APC-2 laminates preciously. The 
modified diaphragm curing process was adopted to manufacture the hybrid laminates for minimal 
impact of production. 
Basically, the tensile tests at elevated temperature were conducted to obtain the baseline data 
of mechanical properties, such as strength and stiffness. Then, the tension-tension (T-T) constant 
stress amplitude cyclic tests were performed at elevated temperature to receive the S-N curves, 
fatigue strength and life. It is a surprise that almost no delaminations were observed in tensile and 
cyclic tests, even at elevated temperature. The received data of hybrid laminates can be predicted by 
the rule of mixtures (ROM) optimally.

was found much better as demonstrated by the results of tensile and cyclic tests even at 
elevated temperature. After anodic processing, the thickness of oxide coating film was about 
40~80nm. The anodic oxide coating was observed very uniformly by SEM, and the 
composition of coating found by EDS consisting of TiO2. 
The cross-ply APC-2 prepregs were sandwiched with the Ti sheets to produce 
Ti/CF/PEEK hybrid laminated composites, expressed as Ti/APC-2/Ti/APC-2/Ti totally 5 
layers. SiO2 nanoparticles were spread uniformly on the APC-2 interfaces with an optimal 1% 
by weight. The modified diaphragm curing process was adopted as shown in Fig. 1. The 
geometry and dimensions of a hybrid composite specimen were shown in Fig. 2. 
3 EXPERIMENTAL 
An MTS-810 servohydraulic computer-controlled dynamic material testing machine was 
used to conduct the tensile test and constant stress amplitude T-T cyclic test with stress 
ratio=0.1, frequency=5Hz, sinusoidal wave form under load-controlled mode at elevated 
temperatures, such as 25°C(RT), 75, 100, 125, 150°C (slightly above APC-2 Tg=143°C). An 
MTS 651 environmental chamber was also installed to keep and control the corresponding 
temperature of a specimen for testings. A 25mm MTS-634.11F-25 extensometer was used to 
monitor the strain continuously during the tests. 
4 RESULTS 
The mechanical properties, such as ultimate tensile strength and longitudinal stiffness of 
Ti/APC-2 cross-ply composite laminates at elevated temperatures were listed in Table 1 and 
plotted in Fig. 3 by both surface treatments for contrast. The nanoscale structure of oxide 
layer which has been observed by SEM was shown in Fig. 4. A columnar and porous layer 
grown on titanium with fluorinated chromic acid electrolyte was found uniform. Combined 
with previous results, the strength and stiffness of Mg/APC-2, Al/APC-2 and Ti/APC-2 
hybrid laminates were presented in Figs. 5-6, respectively. The strength and stiffness of 
Ti/APC-2 laminates predicted by the ROM in comparison with experimental data were listed 
in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The mechanical properties at elevated temperature in Ti/APC-
2 cross-ply composite and nanocomposite laminates were shown in Table 4 for contrast. 
Then, the stress vs. cycles (S-N) curves by mechanical polishing surface treatment of 
titanium sheet were received due to constant stress amplitude T-T tests at elevated 
temperatures as shown in Fig. 7. It is reasonable to see the curves go downwards as 
temperature rising. The normalized stress vs. cycles curves were shown in Fig. 8, in which the 
curves were almost mixed together. It needs be mentioned the normalized stress is the stress 
normalized by the ultimate strength at the corresponding temperature, not at RT. Next, from 
the S-N curves the samples due to anodic method of treatment in Ti sheets were found much 
better resistance to cyclic loading and no delaminations were observed as shown in Fig. 9. 
The normalized S-N curves were shown in Fig. 10. Some samples in Figs. 9 and 10 did not 
fail even over a million of cycles at elevated temperatures. 
5 DISCUESSION  
It is interesting to see the ultimate strength of Ti/APC-2 laminates decreases as 
temperature rising; whilst, the longitudinal stiffness almost remains unchanged for both

ABSTRACT 
 
The innovatively high performance AL/APC-2 hybrid cross-ply nanocomposite laminates were 
successfully fabricated. The well-known problem of delamination was mostly eliminated by 
the surface treatment of electroplating of Al 2024 sheets, instead of conventionally chemical 
etching by CrO3 etchants. Additions of optimal nanoparticles of SiO2 into APC-2 cross-ply 
laminates were used to improve the mechanical properties of hybrid laminates even at 
elevated temperature. From the received data, the mechanical properties, such as ultimate 
tensile strength and longitudinal stiffness, of hybrid nanocomposite laminates by 
electroplating are better than those by chemical etching about 6% to 10%. As for the 
tension-tension (T-T) constant stress amplitude cyclic tests at elevated temperature, the 
applies stress vs. cycles (S-N) curves go downwards as the temperature rising. However, the 
normalized S-N curves, by the corresponding ultimate strength at specific temperature, 
become mixed together. They are separate at least over 105 cycles. That evidently 
demonstrate the superior properties of the hybrid nanocomposite laminates have been 
achieved. Also, no delaminations were found in tensile and cyclic tests at elevated 
temperature. That significantly shows a nearly perfect bonding in hybrid laminates is made.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Nowadays, “lighter, thinner, stronger and cheaper” are the goals of materials science and 
engineering, especially in nanoscale age. Engineering material at the atomic and molecular 
levels are creating a revolution in the fields of materials and processing. The discovery of new 
nanoscaled materials, such as nanoclays, carbon nanotubes, and others offer the promise of 
a variety of new composite, adhesive, coating and sealant materials with specific properties. 
However, our concern is focused on a small part of engineering application, i.e., adding 
nanoparticles on the interfaces in APC-2 composite laminates to make a significant 
improvement of mechanical properties due to static and cyclic loadings at elevated 
temperature. Hussain et al. [1-2] found the mechanical properties are highly increased in 
Carbon/Epoxy composites by adding Al2O3 particles. Kim [3] revealed the improvement of 
interface properties by spreading SiC nanoparticles. The effect on wear and friction by adding 
SiC nanoparticles in PEEK was studied by Lin [4]. Practically, PEEK matrix mixed with nano 
carbon fibers of 15% by wt. can reach the optimal strength and stiffness [5]. Qi [6] investigated 
the synthesis of polymer colloids, hollow nanoparticles and nanofibers. Li [7] presented the 
manufacturing and processing methods in nanocomposites, nanometals and semi-conductor 
particles. Jen, et al. [8] found the significant improvements of mechanical properties in APC-2 
a specimen for test. A 25mm MTS-634.11F-25 extensometer was used to monitor the strain 
continuously during the tests.

RESULTS 
 
The mechanical properties of AL/APC-2 cross-ply nanocomposite laminates at elevated 
temperatures were listed in Table 1 for both surface treatments.  
 
both surface treatments were listed in Table 1 to highlight the significant improvement of 
material properties, such as longitudinal stiffness and ultimate tensile strength. Most 
importantly, using the anodic method in fabrication of samples no delaminations were 
observed due to both tensile and cyclic tests even at elevated temperatures. The successful 
fabrication of Al/APC-2 hybrid laminates assures the nearly perfect bonding among Al sheets 
and APC-2 layups and better properties of hybrid laminates by the proposed fabrication 
process. The SEM of Al sheet surface treated by anodic method was described in Figure 4 
that showed the uniformity of coating.

method: (b) x500 (c) x50000 (d) x100000 
 
As the temperature rising, it is interesting to observe that the trend of longitudinal stiffness is 
monotonically nondecreasing, whilst, the ultimate tensile strength is almost unchanged except 
a slight drop less than 10% at 150°C. It is generally reasonable to see the S-N curves go 
downwards as temperature increasing. Also it goes the same way when the stress normalized 
by the ultimate strength at RT. However, the positions of normalized S-N curves become close 
together when normalized by the corresponding ultimate strength at each specific 
temperature. That fully demonstrate the improvement of mechanical properties is achieved. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The Al/APC-2 cross-ply nanocomposite laminates were successfully fabricated. The 
mechanical properties subject to tensile and cyclic tests at elevated temperatures were
