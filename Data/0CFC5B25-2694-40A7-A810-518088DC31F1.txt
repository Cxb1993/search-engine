carried out with HSPICE in a 0.35µm CMOS process 
[5]. 
 
II. PULSEWIDTH CONTROL LOOP CIRCUIT 
 
The conventional PWCL [1] is shown in Fig. 1. The 
feed-forward path is a multistage clock buffer with the 
control stage controlled by the output of the feedback 
circuit. In the feedback path, CP1 is a charge pump to 
convert pulsewidth into current, which it charges or 
discharges capacitor C, while CP2 is the other identical 
charge pump used to produce a reference voltage (Vref). 
The comparator is used to produce the feedback control 
voltage Vctr for the control stage. The PWCL proposed in 
[4] uses a push-pull charge pump to replace the feedback 
circuitry of the conventional PWCL, in which the power 
supply voltage of the PWCL can be reduced to at least 
1.8V. However, these designs [1], [4] have a mortally 
drawback which is the duty cycle of the reference clock 
must be 50%.  
The block diagram of the proposed PWCL is shown in 
Fig. 2. The low-pass filter (LPF) is used to produce a 
reference voltage (Vref), which is proportional to the duty 
cycle of CKout. The charge pump (CP) converts 
pulsewidth into current, which charges or discharges 
capacitor C1. The comparator is used to produce the 
differential feedback control voltage Vctr-p and Vctr-n for 
the control stage. When the duty cycle of CKout is less 
(more) than 50%, the charge pump will keep more (less) 
charges on C1 so as to make VC rise (fall). The output of 
the comparator, Vctr-p falls (rises) and Vctr-n rises (falls), 
which produces a longer (shorter) LOW state at node 1 
and 2 so that the duty cycle of CKout will increase 
(decrease). Notice that the Vref will rise (fall) since the 
pulsewidth of CKout becomes wider (narrower). 
Therefore, VC will equal to Vref when the loop is 
stabilized and CKout keeps the clock duty cycle at 50%.

III. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
The simulation conditions are fc (CKin) = 500MHz 
(20% duty cycle), tr(input signal rising time) = tf(falling 
time) = 0.1Tc(signal period), and VDD=3V. The 
simulation waveforms are depicted in Fig. 3. Clearly, the 
proposed circuit converges efficiently and good 
pulsewidth accuracy can be obtained in CKout. The 
relationship between the duty cycle of CKin and the 
convergence time of the circuit can be analysed with the 
simulation conditions: fc (CKin) = 500MHz, tr = tf = 
0.1Tc, VDD=3V and the duty cycle of CKin at 20%, 30%, 
40%. The simulation waveforms are shown in Fig. 4, 
which indicates that the convergence times are 
independent of the duty cycle of Ckin. 
Moreover, the relationship between the rising/falling 
time of CKin and the convergence time of circuit is 
shown in Fig. 5 based on the simulation conditions, fc 
(CKin) = 500MHz (30% duty cycle), VDD=3V and tr = tf 
= 0.05Tc, 0.1Tc, 0.2Tc. Obviously, the convergence 
times of circuit are also independent of the rising and 
falling time of CKin.
