assumed to come from the same hypothesis. Decentralized detection techniques are employed to make a
final decision at the fusion center. In the other collaborative detection problem, sensor nodes may observe
different local phenomena. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in this problem, sensor networks are asked to determine
where the regions or boundaries of different local phenomena are located by analyzing distinguishable
collected attributions of the monitored area. The nodes inside the event region have different hypotheses
from the nodes outside the event region.
Decentralized detection with different local phenomena can be found in [14]– [18]. In the problem
settings of [14], [15], the underlying phenomena are independent at senor nodes. Thus, sensor nodes
measure independent information, and the false discovery rate concept is used to design the distributed
detection algorithm. Estimation of inhomogeneous fields which are composed of two or more homogeneous
regions and boundaries is considered in [16]. The fields are estimated through least square fit of either a
constant or a platelet in each square generated by a recursive dyadic partition and prunings.
Event-region detection is considered in [17] and [18], where all sensors collect dependent noisy
observations coupled by spatially correlated hypothesis configurations. Sensors in WSNs are usually
deployed with high densities. Therefore, nearby sensors are likely to have similar underlying hypotheses
due to the spatial correlation. This makes the information contained in the spatial configuration very
precious on the design of collaborative event-region and boundary detection schemes. In [17], each node
ns updates its decision by using the evidence δ|Vs| , where δ is the number of its neighboring nodes reporting
the same decision as node ns and |Vs| is total number of the neighboring nodes of ns. The theoretical and
simulation results show that the performance of the detection algorithms is better than that of the algorithms
which perform detection independently without using spatial information. In [18], iterated conditional
modes (ICM) algorithms are derived for event-region detection with the hypothesis configuration modeled
4not addressed in [17] and [18]. This problem is critical in many applications. For example, a person
walking from a safe region towards a dangerous area would like to receive a warning signal [19]. To
address the boundary-region detection problem, we adopt the same concept as in [19] and [20], which
transforms the problem of boundary-region detection to the problem of boundary-sensor detection. This
is reasonable since the detected boundary nodes can be viewed as the markers of the boundary region.
We then formulate boundary-sensor detection as a binary-hypothesis-testing problem.
The major contributions achieved by this project can be summarized as follows. We incorporate both
local detection performance and spatial information into the decentralized detection design such that
the reliability of spatial information can be modeled. This is different from the works in [17] and [18]
where local detection performance is not employed in their fusion approaches. The proposed fusion rule
performs in a sequential manner. Communication constraints and possible sensor faults are considered in
the design of the fusion rule. The algorithm is applicable to both event-region detection and boundary-
region detection.
The advantages of our strategy are demonstrated through performance comparison with two sequential
detection schemes. By comparing with the sequential ICM scheme, which is modified from the ICM
scheme in [18], the proposed approach achieves a better performance due to the use of the local detection
performance in the fusion process. As compared to the sequential detection without the collaboration
(SDWOC) scheme, the proposed approach has a larger decreasing rate of the error probability as a
function of the time index due to the utilization of spatial information.
II. 問題敘述與解決方法
A. Problem statement
For the problem of event-region detection, each sensor node is designed to distinguish the null hypothesis
H corresponding to no event having occurred and the alternative hypothesis K corresponding to the event
having occurred at its location. The a priori probabilities of both hypotheses are denoted by P (H) = PH
and P (K) = PK, respectively.
In [21], it is indicated that wireless transmission of data accounts for a major portion of the total
energy consumption. Additionally, passive sensors consume relatively negligible power as compared with
6decision made by sensor ns is denoted by
u(j)s =

 1, if H is rejected;0, otherwise.
Notably, the hypothesis configuration H does not have superscript (j) because the considered event is
assumed to be static during the time of sequential decision making.
The detection algorithm consists of exchanging binary decisions between neighboring nodes. However,
WSNs are very likely to have faulty sensor nodes due to harsh environmental situations. Moreover, it
is possible that there are channel errors in communications. In this research, sensor faults and channel
transmission errors are considered in an integrated model, which is established by defining the probabilities
of receiving incorrect decisions from the neighboring nodes. Specifically, p1r = P (uˇ(j)r = 1|u(j)r = 0) is
the probability that the received decision, uˇ(j)r , is 1 when the theoretical decision of nr (decision without
any sensor fault), u(j)r , is 0. p0r = P (uˇ(j)r = 0|u(j)r = 1) is defined similarly. These failure probabilities
are assumed to be known in advance and to be independent of the observations and hypotheses.
We assume that the sensor observations Y(j) are conditionally independent given H and that the
distribution of each Y (j)s conditioned on H is equal to its distribution conditioned on Hs. Based on
these assumptions, the distribution of Y(j) given H can be expressed as
p(Y(j) = y(j)|H = h) =
∏
s∈S
p(Y (j)s = y
(j)
s |Hs = hs) (1)
In addition, we assume that the observations at node ns are conditionally independent across time, i.e.,
y
(j)
s , y
(j−1)
s , . . . , y
(0)
s are conditionally independent given each hypothesis. Our problem is how to identify
the hypothesis configuration h given the sensor observations y(j),y(j−1), . . . ,y(0). From (1), it is clear
that, each node in S observes its own phenomenon (H or K) and could be different from those observed
at the other nodes. In this research, the spatial interaction among the hypotheses {Hs}s∈S is modeled by
the MRF [22]. The MRF has long been recognized as an accurate model to describe a variety of spatial
characteristics [23].
B. Markov random fields
An MRF model, defined with respect to a neighborhood system V , has been proved to be equivalent
to the Gibbs field [22] whose potentials are associated with V . We first describe the concepts of a clique
and a neighborhood system, since the elementary relationships within the neighborhood V are established
8The prior probability of an MRF in (3) is determined by the energy of hypothesis configurations, and
a higher energy value results in a lower prior probability. From (4) and (5), the energy function is related
to the clique types and spatial interaction coefficients. Therefore, the energy function is a measure of
the energy of a hypothesis configuration under specified clique types and spatial interaction coefficients.
Different neighborhood systems can have different clique types, resulting in different prior probabilities,
even though they are with the same hypothesis configurations.
C. Low-communication-rate detection
Recall that, our event-region detection scheme requires the sensor nodes to communicate with their
neighbors at each time step. For the scarcity of bandwidth resources in WSNs, it is essential to design a
low-communication-rate detection scheme.
At each time j, node ns makes its decision u(j)s by fusing its own observation and the received decisions
from the neighbors. We are aware that the communication bandwidth can be conserved if, under the
assumption of perfect synchronization, node ns does not transmit frequently when u(j)s = u(j−1)s and the
neighbors {nt}t∈Vs assume u(j)s to be the same as u(j−1)s when the node nt does not receive the decision
u
(j)
s at time j. This is a reasonable scheme because when u(j)s = u(j−1)s , spatial information provided for its
neighbors by node ns is not very informative. In particular, when the communication channel is error-free,
the neighbors {nt}t∈Vs obtain the exact decision made by node ns, i.e., u(j)s = u(j−1)s , if {nt}t∈Vs does
not receive a decision from ns. Notably, to incorporate spatial information contributed by node ns, nodes
{nt}t∈Vs still need to update local detection performance of ns at time j, even though node ns does not
send out its decision u(j)s .
Define the average probability of transmission at node ns as
Rs , r1P
(
u(j)s = u
(j−1)
s
)
+ r2P
(
u(j)s 6= u(j−1)s
)
, (6)
where r1 and r2 are the probabilities of transmission given u(j)s = u(j−1)s and u(j)s 6= u(j−1)s , respectively.
r2 > r1, i.e., the transmission probability is larger when u(j)s 6= u(j−1)s . This is more cost effective on data
transmission. If we denote cT ∈ [0,∞) as the cost per transmission, then the expected cost arising from
transmission corresponding to (6) can be expressed as
Cs = C1P
(
u(j)s = u
(j−1)
s
)
+ C2P
(
u(j)s 6= u(j−1)s
)
= CP
(
u(j)s 6= u(j−1)s
)
+ C1 (7)
10
large cT represents a heavy penalty on communication. In fact, based on the analysis in III. B, C ≥ 1 can
be regarded as an extremely heavy penalty on communication, since P (u(j)s 6= u(j−1)s ) is forced to be 0.
By optimizing (8), a trade-off between the communication cost and the error probability may be realized.
Similar formulations can be found in [4], [24], [25].
Remark 2: The choice of c0 in the constrained optimization criterion (9) depends on the physical
resources and practical requirements of sensor nodes. For example, if the cost per transmission cT is one
unit, and the total available communication capacity for node ns is B bits, then we set c0 = B units. c0
can also be a function of energy consumption allowed. Here we use a general notation c0 to include all
these constraints and derive corresponding decision rules.
Note that, even without considering the communication cost, the decision rules obtained by the criteria
(8) and (9) need not result in the minimum probability of error of the whole region of interest, i.e.,
choose u(j) if u(j) = argmax
H
P
(
H
∣∣Y(j),u(j−1) ) . (11)
However, obtaining the decision rules by criterion (11) is very complicated for practical implementation.
The solutions for (11) is intractable and hard to scale well for a WSN with a large number of sensor
nodes.
The decision strategies δ(j)s obtained by solving (8) or (9) are the proposed space-memory fusion rules
at node ns given y(j)s , u(j−1)s , and {uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs . This sensor fusion rule is different from the Chair-Varshney
fusion rule [4]. The proposed space-memory fusion rule is to fuse information when the observations at
all the sensors are drawn from possibly different hypotheses, while the Chair-Varshney fusion rule is to
combine the information when the observations at all the sensors are drawn from the same hypothesis.
The optimal decision rule based on the criteria (8) and (9), is presented in Theorem 1, whose proof is
provided in the Appendix.
Theorem 1: Given the sensor observation y(j)s , the local decision u(j−1)s , and the neighboring decisions
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , the optimal decision rules δ(j)s for the sensor node ns at time j based on the criteria (8) or
(9) are given by

Therefore, the decision rule in (12) can be written in the form of a likelihood ratio test of the local

The effects of local detection performances at node ns and time j−1 and spatial information are combined
in ηs and are used to adjust local thresholds.
Next, we show that P

{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s |{ht}t∈Vs , hs
)
in (19), which can be viewed as a fused
detection performance of the decisions {uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs, u(j−1)s given the local hypothesis configuration,
can be computed in a recursive way, i.e., P
(
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s |{ht}t∈Vs , hs
)
can be obtained from
P

. Define As = {nt}t∈{Vr}r∈{Vs,s} , which is the set of nodes consisting
of node ns, all the neighbors of node ns, and all the neighbors of nodes {nt}t∈Vs . Fig. 3 illustrates a
four-connectivity neighborhood and its corresponding As. For such a neighborhood system, node ns needs
to maintain 25 probabilities P
(
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s |{ht}t∈Vs , hs

at each time for 25 possible hypothesis
configurations of this neighborhood. For different neighborhood systems, a different number of fused
detection performances needs to be maintained. Especially, for each

The last component that is necessary to update (20) is P ({u(j−2)q }q∈As\{Vs,s}|{u(j−2)q }q∈{Vs,s}, {ht}t∈Vs , hs),
which is the fused detection performance of the rest of the nodes in the set As given local decisions and
the underlying hypothesis configuration of node ns and its neighborhood. The computational complexity to
obtain the exact probability P ({u(j−2)q }q∈As\{Vs,s}|{u(j−2)q }q∈{Vs,s}, {ht}t∈Vs , hs) grows exponentially with
time due to the propagation of spatial correlation with each iteration. In this research, we approximate
this probability by a uniform distribution, i.e.,
P
({
u(j−2)q
}
q∈As\{Vs,s}
∣∣∣ {u(j−2)q }q∈{Vs,s}, {ht}t∈Vs , hs)
≈ 1
2|As\{Vs,s}|
. (24)
The accuracy of this approximation depends on the degree of the spatial correlation. Unless the spatial
correlation is extremely strong, the result of the conducted examples shows that the approximation in (24)
can perform well for MRF models.

IV. 研究方法– 邊界區域偵測
As the aforementioned concept, the problem of boundary-region detection can be formulated as boundary-
sensor detection. The latter can be considered as a binary-hypothesis-testing problem where each hypoth-
esis corresponds to either a nonboundary node or a boundary node.
B0 : The target sensor is a nonboundary sensor.
B1 : The target sensor is a boundary sensor.
By Definitions 1 and 2, B0 consists of the collection of the hypothesis configurations {{{ht}t∈Vs , hs} :∑
t∈Vs
ht ⊕ hs = 0}, and B1 consists of the collection {{{ht}t∈Vs , hs} :
∑
t∈Vs
ht ⊕ hs 6= 0}, where ⊕
denotes the exclusive-OR operation. For compactness, we use {{ht}t∈Vs, hs}Bℓ to denote the hypothesis
configuration {{ht}t∈Vs, hs} when Bℓ is true. Accordingly, we have the a priori probabilities
PM(Bℓ) =
∑
{{ht}t∈Vs ,hs}Bℓ
PM ({{ht}t∈Vs , hs}) , ℓ = 0, 1. (26)
The maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion is adopted for detecting boundary sensors.
Specifically, at node ns and time j, choose Bk, if
Bk = arg max
Bℓ,ℓ=0,1
P
(
Bℓ
∣∣∣{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s ) . (27)
By utilizing Bayes’s rule, (27) can be rewritten as
Bk = arg max
Bℓ,ℓ=0,1
P
(
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s
∣∣∣Bℓ)PM (Bℓ)
P
(
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s
) .
Since P
(
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s
)
is independent of Bℓ when the operation of maximization is considered,
the above equation reduces to
Bk = arg max
Bℓ,ℓ=0,1
P
(
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s
∣∣∣Bℓ)PM (Bℓ) .
By (26), the above equation can be further expanded as
Bk =arg max
Bℓ,ℓ=0,1
∑
{{ht}t∈Vs ,hs}Bℓ
P
(
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s
∣∣∣
{ht}t∈Vs , hs
)
PM ({ht}t∈Vs , hs) , (28)
where P
(
{uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs , u(j−1)s
∣∣∣ {ht}t∈Vs , hs) in (28) can be obtained from (20) by implementing the space-
memory fusion rule at each time.
18
The sequential detection without the collaboration (SDWOC), i.e., no information exchange with the
neighbors, was also conducted here. Specifically, for the SDWOC approach, each node ns takes a new
observation y(j)s , and makes its decision u(j)s at time j by maximizing its log-likelihood, which is expressed
as
choose u(j)s = hs, if,
hs = arg max
hs=H,K
j∑
i=0
ln p
y
(i)
s |Hs
(
y(i)s
∣∣Hs = hs) . (30)
In (30), SDWOC uses the full memory of past observations {y(0)s , y(1)s , . . . , y(j)s } to make the decision u(j)s .
This is similar to the SPRT approach except that no stopping rule is set. The purpose of comparing the
SDWOC approach with the proposed space-memory fusion rule is to show that the decreasing rate of the
error probability can be improved substantially by exchanging decisions with neighbors, which contain
the spatial information.
Since the performance evaluations in this project consist of both event-region detection and boundary-
sensor detection, two types of error probabilities are defined.
Definition 3: Error probability of event detection, Eevent, is the error probability of deciding in favor
of one of the two event hypotheses, i.e., H or K.
Definition 4: Error probability of boundary-sensor detection, Eboundary, is the error probability of de-
ciding in favor of either nonboundary-sensor hypothesis B0 or boundary-sensor hypothesis B1.
A. An example of event-region detection
In this example, we consider a network consisting of 2601 nodes. Without loss of generality, we consider
that the nodes are regularly distributed in a 51 × 51 square grid of 51 × 51 units area4. Fig. 4 shows a
sample scenario of the simulated event region. In the figure, if hypothesis H is true at a sensor node, the
node is represented by a circle “◦”. Otherwise, the node is represented by a bullet “•” and hypothesis K
is true. The hypothesis configurations in the simulated WSN are generated by setting β = 1 and using the
Gibbs sampler [23]. The details of the Gibbs sampler are not discussed here. For the purpose of simplicity,
4Extension of the simulation to any irregularly deployed WSN is straightforward, since our employed neighborhood system is defined by
a general model in (2). The only difference for an irregularly deployed WSN is that the sensor density may be different from place to place.
Obviously, the area with higher density will have a better performance since the spatial correlation is higher. However, in this project, our
purpose is to show that, given a WSN, our approach can improve detection performances as compared with other schemes. Therefore, for
simplicity of demonstration, we evaluate our approach in a regularly deployed WSN.

sensors should be evaluated in terms of Eboundary instead of Eevent. To be more precise, only through
boundary-sensor detection, nodes can warn users when they are moving closer to a boundary region. In
fact, a low value of Eevent could possibly correspond to a high value of Eboundary for the boundary nodes.
For instance, the SDWOC approach does not use any information from neighboring decisions, and could
result in a low Eevent due to no interference when boundary nodes are considered. However, it results in
a high Eboundary due to the same reason. This phenomenon shall be demonstrated later. In Fig. 8, Eevent
of the space-memory fusion decreases much faster than the other two approaches. Additionally, both the
space-memory fusion and sequential ICM result in floors of Eevent when time continually increases, while

events that u(j)s 6= u(j−1)s over the entire field for nonboundary sensors and boundary sensors, respectively.
The communication amount per sensor at the initial time j = 0 is 1 bit, since all sensors broadcast
their binary decisions to their neighbors and hence it is constant for all the C values. Compared with
schemes without considering the communication constraint5, the reduction in the amount of communication
is significant by using our low-communication-rate scheme. Without loss of generality, C1 and C2 are
respectively set to 0 and C. As expected, a higher value of C results in less amount of communication.
From this table, we observe another interesting phenomenon, which can be clearly explained by the
Bayesian-optimized effect as mentioned in Remark 1. When C is not large (C = 0, 0.2, and 0.4), in
order to reduce the probability of error, boundary sensors incur more communication than nonboundary
sensors because the decisions made by boundary sensors (which are in inhomogeneous regions) are more
difficult to converge as compared with nonboundary sensors (which are in a homogeneous area). When C
becomes large (C = 0.6), in order to minimize the overall Bayesian cost, boundary sensors stop trading
more communication for better detection performance.
From Figs. 8 and 9, Eevent of sequential ICM lies between Eevent’s of space-memory fusions with
C = 0.2 and C = 0.4. This implies that the space-memory fusion method with C = 0.2 can achieve
5If each sensor broadcasts its local decisions at each time step, the total amount of communication is 31 bits per sensor for 31 time steps.

B. An example of boundary-sensor detection
In this example, the performance of boundary-sensor detection by the space-memory fusion was eval-
uated. For comparison, both sequential ICM and SDWOC can be designed for boundary-sensor detection
based on Definitions 1 and 2. That is, node ns decides it is a boundary-node if any of its neighboring
decisions {uˇ(j−1)t }t∈Vs is different from its own decision u(j−1)s , and it decides it is a nonboundary-node,
otherwise. Notably, the above design implies that we have assumed that the sensor node can obtain the
decisions of its neighbors when the SDWOC approach was investigated7.
Here, the same signal strength γs is used for evaluation as in the previous example. The sensor failure
probabilities p1s and p0s are set to be zero for all ns in this simulation. Fig. 10 illustrates a sample
scenario of boundary regions, where a boundary sensor is marked by a “•” and the nonboundary sensors
are marked by “⋄” or “×” depending on the presence of H or K, respectively.
The performance results of applying sequential ICM, SDWOC, and the space-memory fusion to the
scenario in Fig. 10 are presented in Figs. 11, 12, and 13, respectively, where a “•” represents the decision
in favor of a boundary node and “·” represents the decision in favor of a nonboundary node. From these
figures, the superiority of the space-memory fusion over the other two approaches in the sense of minimum
Eboundary is clearly demonstrated.
We again generated 1000 different scenarios of simulated boundary regions, and each scenario consists
of 2601 nodes as in Fig. 10. We calculated the average Eboundary over these 1000 simulated scenarios.
Different from the previous example, this average Eboundary was calculated over all nodes in all scenarios.
Fig. 14 plots the average Eboundary as a function of time j. From this figure, we again observe that the
space-memory fusion outperforms the other two approaches.
Finally, Fig. 15 illustrates the average Eevent for boundary nodes. Comparing Fig. 14 with Fig. 15, two
phenomena can be observed. Firstly, a lower value of Eevent corresponds to a higher value of Eboundary
for the boundary nodes when comparing SDWOC with the space-memory fusion and sequential ICM.
This is because SDWOC makes decisions independently without collaboration, i.e., without using spatial
information as mentioned earlier. Secondly, the space-memory fusion outperforms sequential ICM in both
Eboundary and Eevent. The performance gain is due to efficient use of the information of local detection
performance.
7For event-region detection, the SDWOC approach makes decision without using the information of neighboring decisions.
