1. Introduction  
The rapid development in mobile communications, mobile telephone systems, and satellite 
broadcasting systems has increased the importance of the design of high-quality devices. Several 
studies have developed dielectric materials with a high quality factor (Q f ), high dielectric 
constant (r), and zero temperature coefficient of resonant frequency ( f ) for use in dielectric 
resonators and microwave device substrates. Materials with a high dielectric constant can 
effectively reduce the size of resonators, since the wavelength (  ) in dielectrics is inversely 
proportional to r  of the wavelength ( 0 ) in a vacuum ( 0 / r   ). A small temperature 
coefficient of resonant frequency is required to ensure the stability of the microwave components at 
various working temperatures. In addition, the reciprocal of the dielectric loss ( 1/ tanQ  ) must 
be high to ensure high frequency selectivity and stability in microwave transmitter components. 
[1-4]. 
Intensive investigations on the BaO–TiO2 system have been carried out since the system 
consists of many components having excellent microwave dielectric properties. In particular, 
BaTi4O9 ceramic first proposed by Statton et. al. is a popular material for microwave frequency 
applications. It has an orthorhombic structure (cell parameters: a = 1.4532 nm, b = 0.3791 nm, c = 
0.6291 nm), belonging to the space group Pmmn (59) (ICDD-PDF# 01-075-2048). The BaTi4O9 has 
a high dielectric constant ( r =35–39), a high quality factor (Q×f = 20,000–30,000 GHz), and a 
positive f  value ( f < 20 ppm/oC) [5]. However, a severe degradation of dielectric properties gives 
rise since the conventional high-temperature sintering route ~ 1400oC always leads to a 
dielectric resonator method [6] [7]. A system composed of an HP8757D network analyzer and an 
HP8350B sweep oscillator was employed in the measurement. The technique used for the 
measurement of the temperature coefficient of resonant frequency ( f ) was the same as that used 
for theQ  factor measurement. A test cavity was placed over a thermostat. The temperature range 
was 25 to 80oC. f (ppm/oC) was calculated by considering the change in resonant frequency ( f ):

where 1f  and 2f  represent the resonant frequencies at 1T  and 2T , respectively. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Fig.1 shows the XRD patterns of the BaTi4-xZrxO9 (0.025 x  0.1) ceramics sintered at 
1300oC for 4 h. The XRD patterns show that they are all single orthorhombic structure phase 
(which can be indexed as BaTi4O9). These results illustrated BaTi4-xZrxO9 (0.025 x  0.1) ceramics 
would form a solid solution with the replacement of Ti by Zr. Table 1 shows the microwave 
dielectric properties of BaTi4-xZrxO9 (0 x  0.1) ceramics sintered at 1300oC for 4 h. An apparent 
variance in the dielectric properties due to the x value can be observed. When the x value was 
increased from 0 to 0.05, the apparent density increased to a maximum value of 4.42 g/cm3, and 
then decreased. The variations of r and Q×f were consistent with that of the density. Maximum r 
and Q×f values of 35.5 and 63,700 GHz were obtained for specimen using x = 0.05, respectively. 
When x  0.075, the r value increased because the ionic polarizability of Zr4+ (Zr4+=0.325 nm3) is 
greater than that of Ti4+ (Ti4+=0.293 nm3) [8]. A lower density and higher polarizability leads to a 
than 1300oC, which might degrade the microwave dielectric properties. A dense microstructure with 
low porosity was obtained at 1300oC, implying that this was the optimum sintering temperature for 
the system. 
Figure 4 shows the apparent densities and r of BaTi3.95Zr0.05O9 ceramics sintered at various 
temperatures for 4 h. The apparent density increased with temperature to a maximum value of 4.42 
g/cm3 at 1300oC, and then decreased. The reduction of density due to inhomogeneous grain growth 
is shown in Fig. 3. The variation of r was consistent with that of density because higher density 
produces lower porosity. After r reached its maximum value at 1300oC, it decreased. Compared to 
BaTi4O9 ceramics ( r ~34.6, density ~ 4.19 g/cm3) [5], BaTi3.95Zr0.05O9 ceramics had a higher 
density, resulting in a higher r value. A maximum r value of 35.5 was obtained for BaTi3.95Zr0.05O9 
ceramics sintered at 1300oC for 4 h.  
Figure 5 shows the Q×f and f values of BaTi3.95Zr0.05O9 ceramics sintered at various 
temperatures. With increasing sintering temperature, the Q×f value increased to a maximum value 
and then decreased. Several factors contribute to the dielectric loss at microwave frequencies, such 
as density, porosity, second phases, grain boundaries, and inclusions in real homogeneous ceramics 
[11]. The variation of Q×f was consistent with that of density, suggesting that Q×f was most likely 
associated with the corresponding variation in apparent density. A maximum Q×f value of 63,700 
GHz was obtained for BaTi3.95Zr0.05O9 ceramics sintered at 1300°C for 4 h. The Q×f value of 
BaTi3.95Zr0.05O9 is higher than that of BaTi4O9 (Q×f ~ 32,600 GHz) due to an increase in density, as 
previous discussed. The temperature coefficient of resonant frequency (f) is known to be governed
