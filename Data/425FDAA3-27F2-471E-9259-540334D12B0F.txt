preserved or not while the impregnation of Cu and/or 
Zn changed the dispersion state of Cu. This is 
indicated by the effect of support calcination. The 
one prepared with support HT structure while 
impregnation, CuZn/HT573, showed a better C2+ 
selectivity and a higher MeOH conversion than the one 
without (CuZn/HT673). Reduction temperature also 
changed the MeOH conversion rate and the product 
selectivity. EXAFS shows that oxidic Cu was presented 
even after high temperature reduction, suggesting 
Cu+2 may take the interlayer anions positions. DRIFTS 
showed that FAL and its oligomer were presented which 
can explain the formation of C2+. The presence of co-
feed can significantly change the product selectivity 
and/or MeOH conversion rate. In the presence of H2O 
co-feed, acetaldehyde was a dominating C2+ product 
comparing to a broad distribution of C2+ during the 
reaction without co-feed or with H2 co-feed. The 
presence of O2, CO, or CO2 during MeOH reaction 
completely suppressed the formation of C2+ product. 
The support Mg/Al ratio slightly changed the MeOH 
conversion rate and the product selectivity.

the chemical industry. Methane is getting more attention recently as a candidate to replace petroleum. 
However, the shipping of methane is expensive and therefore the on-site conversion of methane to liquid fuel 
is proposed. The partial oxidation of methane to methanol [1-3] is one of the popular reactions for this 
conversion. Accordingly, the chemical industry will need to shift the paradigm to the utilization of methanol. 
Furthermore, methanol can also come from the syn gas from coal conversion and from bio-processes. This 
indicates that a new methanol-economy is happening and may be a major industry sector for the next few 
decades. The conversion of methanol to molecules of longer carbon chain is consequently an important 
technology for using methanol as the source of raw materials. 
The C-C bond formation is required for flexible supply of raw materials from the methanol conversions. 
The methanol-to- gasoline (MTG) [4-6], the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) [7-9], and the 
methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) [10-15] processes are proven technologies, in which zeolites are used 
almost exclusively as catalysts at temperatures from 623 K and above. The acid sites of zeolites catalyze 
dehydration and cracking reactions and higher alkanes and alkenes can be formed via dimethyl ether 
intermediate. Dehydration and cracking involved may lead to catalyst coking. This together with the high 
energy consumptions are the disadvantages of these MTX processes. We found previously [16] that a 
Cu-Zn/Mg-Al HTlcs (hydrotalcite-like compounds) catalyst can catalyze the methanol condensation to form 
higher oxygenates at 573 K and below. The lower reaction temperatures result in lower coking tendency and 
lower energy demand. Furthermore, the products involved more oxygenates comparing to the MTX processes. 
This makes the newly found process an attractive one for methanol conversion to higher hydrocarbons. In this 
study, we examined the effect of preparation procedures and the effect of co-feed species on the methanol 
conversion over the Cu-Zn/HT catalysts. The control of product selectivity of this methanol conversion is our 
main goal in this study. 
4. Experimental 
4.1.Catalyst preparation: The Cu-Zn/Mg-Al HT 4-component catalysts were prepared by either impregnation 
or deposition of component(s) commercial HT supports (Sasol, PURAL MG 50). The commercial HT was 
calcined at either 573 or 673K for 6 hours before uses, and is denoted henceforth as HT573 and HT673 
respectively. Either impregnation or deposition method (at pH=10) was used to load Cu(NO3)2•3H2O (Merck, 
99.5%), Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (Aldrich, 99.8%). The final composition of all the samples was: 
CuO:ZnO:MgO:Al2O3 = 4:3:46.5:46.5 on weight basis. The prepared catalysts were vacuum dried and then 
calcined at either 573 or 673 K. House-prepared HT support was coprecipitated from the aqueous solutions of 
Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich 99.8 %) and Al(NO3)3.6H2O (J.T. Baker, 99 %) by an aqueous solution of 
Na2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95 %) to maintain pH =10 in a reflux system under N2 atmosphere. The resulted 
mixture was aged at 333K, pH = 10, 500 rpm, for 6 hours followed by gravity filtration.  The filtered 
powders was then washed several times using de-ionized water until the pH of the filtrate reached 7 assuming 
all Na+ were washed away. According to the calcination temperature, this house-prepared support was 
acronymed as HTP573. 
   The coprecipitation procedures were used to prepared 3-component (CuMgAl and ZnMgAl) and 
4-component (CuZnMgAl) HT catalysts. A subscript p is used to denote the precipitated HT samples prepared 
in house. Both the 2-component and 3-component HT samples were loaded with Cu(NO3)2•3H2O (Merck, 
99.5%), Zn(NO3)2•6H2O (Aldrich, 99.8%) by either impregnation or deposition method. The deposition 
conditions were the same as those used in the coprecipitation procedures. The prepared samples were 
vacuum-dried overnight at room temperature and stored in desiccators for later uses. 
The methanol reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure with a methanol partial pressure of 26.7 
kPa (200 torr), balanced with helium and a WHSV (weight hourly space velocity, in g MeOH/g catalyst.h) of 
0.2 h-1. The catalyst was loaded into a pyrex reactor and reduced inline by hydrogen typically at 523K. 
Methanol (Merck, spectroscopy grade, 99.95%) was dehydrated by soaking with molecular sieves, then fed 
into a heated foreline using a syringe pump and carried into a reactor by helium. The reactor was subjected to 
a stepwise temperature-ramp sequence in which methanol was fed only at constant- temperature segments. 
The reactor effluent was analyzed by inline GC (Shimadzu 8A, using TCD detector). The reaction conversions 
calculated from the percentage of methanol remained in the effluent. The effluent C-balance is typically 
within + 5 % of the feed when no C2+ products were observed in GC traces. The carbon selectivity is 
calculated as the ratio of the fractional methanol conversion to a specific product to the total methanol 
conversion. The produced C2+ was usually a mixture and therefore, its carbon selectivity is calculated from

TPR indicates that the percentage of CuO reduction in the deposited samples was much lower than that 
of the impregnated samples. This suggests that part of Cu took the MII positions in HT structure and 
consequently was not reduced under the conditions of this test. Fig. 3 shows the effect of reduction 
temperature on the in-situ XRD of the 573K-calcined (CuZn)IM/HTP573. Table 2 shows the analyzed crystal 
structure parameters. The results indicate that HT inter-layer distance shrink with increasing hydrogen 
reduction temperature and the layer structure disappeared after H2 treatment at > 623K when reduced Cu 
phase started to appear. The changes of BET surface area and Cu dispersion of the CuZn/HT673 reduced at 
different temperature are listed in Table 3. It shows that the reduced Cu phase appeared at lower temperature 
when the HT structure was broke down before impregnation.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of reduction temperature on the MeOH conversion over the 673K-calcined

data at 623 K over all the 4-component catalysts prepared in this study, all after hydrogen reduction at 573 K. 
Results showed that the selectivity to C2+ and formaldehyde varied with the catalyst preparation procedure.

Fig 7 Effect of co-feed species on (a) MeoH conversion of Cu-Zn/HT573 and (b) the consumption of co-feed during reaction. 
 
Fig. 8 compares the effect of co-feed on the product selectivity. Without co-feed species (Fig. 8(a)), the 
Cu-Zn/HT573 produced mainly C2+ product at 423 - 473K. FAL, CO and CO2 appeared in the temperature 
ranges when the selectivity of C2+ decreased and formaldehyde selectivity was relatively high. With H2 
co-feed (Fig. 8(b)), CO and C2+ were formed at low temperatures, and thereafter C2+ decreased and FAL and 
CO increased. With H2O co-feed (Fig. 8(c)), conversion products were limited to acetaldehyde (AAL), CO2 
and CO. Acetaldehyde selectivity was very high initially at 423K but went down with temperature when CO2 
selectivity increased. The selectivity of CO was low maintaining < 10% within the experimental temperature 
range. The product was further limited only to CO2 when O2 is used as the co-feed (Fig. 8(d)). When CO or 
CO2 was used as the co-feed (Fig. 8(e), 8(f)), FAL was the only product and the co-feed was not consumed. 
These results indicate that the type of co-feed can change the product selectivity. Among the co-feed species 
tested, H2O is unique in producing a high selectivity to a specific C2+ product, i.e., AAL.

5.3. DRIFTS during MeOH sTPD 
We carried out MeOH adsorption over CuZn/HT573 at 298 K, followed by He purge and a subsequent 
sTPD (stepwise TPD) under different atmosphere of purge gas containing the co-feed species used above. The 
DRIFTS at different temperature under different purge gas during sTPD is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9(a) shows 
that MeOH adsorption on CuZn/HT573 at 298 K yielded molecular MeOH (3238, 2560, 1440, 1120 cm-1), 
methoxy (2941, 2820, 2602, 2468, 1408, 1194, 1060 cm-1), methyl formate (MF, 1660, 1442 cm-1), FAL and 
its polymer (2913, 2843, 1700 - 1850 cm-1), and maybe some carbobnates (1415cm-1) adspecies. Increasing 
 12
[17].Comparatively, the H2 co-feed on CuZn/HT573 also suppressed, but not completely, the formation of C2+ 
and the FAL formation was enhanced. This suggests that H2 suppressed the dehydrogenation of FAL to CO 
over Cu-Zn/HT673 and that the formation of C2+ may involve the reaction of a FAL-derived species.

6. Conclusions 
 We have prepared 4-component Cu-Zn-Mg-Al catalysts with different procedures. The HT-like structure 
was confirmed with all the prepared catalysts. The HT structure was changed by the pretreatment at higher 
temperatures under either oxidation or reduction conditions. In-situ XRD analysis showed that the interlayer 
distance shrinked with increasing pretreatment temperature till a limit when layer structure broke down. The 
stability of HT-like structure varied with the catalyst preparation procedure.  After impregnation, HT 
structure resurrected with interlayer anions containing the NO3 and OH from the surroundings. The catalyst 
prepared by the impregnation over a support with preserved HT structure (HT573) dispersed Cu moiety better 
than that over a support without the preserved HT structure (HT673). Part of the Cu included retained oxidized 
even after high temperature reduction. This suggests a tendency of Cu and/or Zn to take the MII position in HT 
structure.  
The MeOH reaction performance varied over differently prepared and pretreated CuZn/HT catalysts. The 
CuZn/HT573-R573 yielded a high C2+ product selectivity at 423 – 523 K which decreased with further increase 
of temperature. In comparison, the CuZn/HT673-R573 showed a peak C2+ product selectivity at 523 K which 
peak value was lower than that of CuZn/HT573-R573. High C2+ product selectivity was found at a medium 
catalyst reduction temperature at 473 – 573 K. This suggests that oxidic Cu is involved in the MeOH 
conversion. 
The product selectivity during MeOH conversion was also changed by the presence of co-feed species. 
The MeOH conversion was not significantly change by the presence of H2 or H2O, but the C2+ selectivity was 
decreased. The presence of H2O limited the C2+ to include mainly acetaldehyde which clearly showed the 
product selectivity can be tuned by the use of suitable co-feed species.   When using O2, CO, or CO2 as the 
co-feed, the MeOH conversion was significantly decreased and the C2+ selectivity was largely suppressed. 
CO2 was the main product when O2 was presented while FAL was the main product when CO or CO2 was 
included as the co-feed. DRIFTS analysis suggested that FAL formed from MeOH adsorption may 
oligomerize to form C2+ product. The DRIFTS during subsequent desorption varied by the presence of 
different co-feed species in purge gas. With H2, the DRIFTS during sTPD was similar with that without 
co-feed. With H2O, surface adspecies almost completely disappeared with the occurrence of a strong band at

二、與會心得 
本次 NAM 大會中，能源發展領域議題仍是一個顯著佔有較高比例的主題，顯示是美國與全世
界共同熱切探討的議題，與國內外其他觸媒相關研討會的特徵相似，不過 NAM 會議中有許多工業
界人士參與，得以聽聞產業界人士的看法，也明確點出各種新能源技術的優缺點與產業化的限制因
素，得以讓技術發展方向更明確，而這些被提到的限制條件有很大一部份是具有地域性的，透過產
業界與學術界的討論互動，可以對不同地域適合的能源技術發展方向有密切的交流討論。相較而
言，在國內的相關研討會中，極少聽到此類產業界參與的交流討論，可能是形成國內能源相關技術
發展方向多頭分歧的原因之一，值得國內省思與借鏡。此外，美國有許多大的跨國石油或化學公司
例如 Dutch Shell、BP 等，投入龐大的研究經費在觸媒及反應方面，也常常借助學術單位的研發能
量進行技術合作開發，所以他們的技術可以保持領先的地位。國內在觸媒方面的研究發展，主要在
學術界，除非中油、台塑等大廠有興趣投入，單靠學術界的力量，只能有零星的成果。這種產業界
與學術界的互動應該也不是一朝一夕就成形的，有數十年歷史的 NAM 會議，會議流程順暢，與國
內舉辦會議相較，最顯著的差異是來自工業界的與會者人數相對多，且工業界發表論文篇數也相對
多，可以看到工業界與學術界相當多的互動，這是國內研討會較少見的；缺少產業界互動，也可能
會使國內的學術研究無法跨入實際應用的技術領域，應該是我們需要嘗試改進的，也是舉辦研會實
應該要嚐試達到更多的產業界互動。

Introduction 
High efficiency production of hydrogen, with a low environmental impact is the Holy Grail of the 
growing fuel cell industry [1]. Bio-ethanol (ethanol produced from biomass) provides a renewable carbon 
cycle when it is used as the feedstock for hydrogen production. The ethanol steam reforming (ESR) reaction 
(C2H5OH + 3 H2O Æ 6 H2 + 2 CO2) has become an attractive alternative. This multi-molecular reaction 
process involves several reaction pathways giving off hydrogen and numerous by-products such as carbon 
oxides, methane, ethylene, acetaldehyde, coke, etc. The efficiency of hydrogen production from ESR reaction 
depends on the control of the formation of these products. Therefore, a properly designed catalysts for ESR 
reaction is important, to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for hydrogen production. 
Ni-based catalysts are active for the ESR reaction. However, deactivation by carbon deposition is a 
serious problem for ESR over Ni-based catalysts. Carbon deposition causes the loss of active sites, while the 
formation of filamentous carbon can lead to metal leaching and reactor blocking. Consequently, promoters 
such as K [2] and B [3] were used to improve the coking resistance of Ni-based catalysts. In this study, we 
present the effect of boron on the coking of a Ni-Cu catalyst during ESR reaction. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Cu-Ni/SiO2 catalysts of 5 wt% Cu and 5wt% Ni metal loading were prepared by impregnating SiO2 
support (Davison 952, 300 m2/g, used after calcinations at 823 K) with a metal (Cu and Ni) nitrate (Aldrich, 
98%) aqueous solution, to incipient wetness, and dried at 298 K under low vacuum. Thereafter, the catalyst 
was dispersed in H2O, and stirred for 10 min. To the mixture, a 5% NaBH4 (diluted from Aldrich, 98.5 %) 
solution was added at room temperature at different boron hydride concentration. After additional stirring for 
30 min, the solid was recovered by centrifugation and washed extensively with H2O. The samples were dried 
at 393K for 2 h and subsequently calcined in air at 673K for 5 h. This resulted in a B loading in the final 
catalyst of approximately 0, 1.5 and 4.5 wt % respectively. The B loading was analyzed by ICP analysis of the 
filtrates. 
Reaction tests were performed in a quartz-tube packed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. In each 
experiment, 0.1 g of the catalyst was sandwiched between quartz wool, installed in a home-made system, and 
reduced with 20 vol % H2/N2 (50 ml/min) at 623 K for 1 h. The ethanol aqueous solution with H2O/ethanol = 
6 (mol) was fed by a syringe pump and a He vapor flew into the reactor at a EtOH partial pressure of 5.67 kPa 
(42.5 torr) and a WHSV (weight hourly space velocity, g EtOH/g catalyst/h) of 2 h-1. The reaction was carried 
out in a temperature-programmed mode at 1 K/min from 523 – 773 K.

Introduction 
Hydrogen is one of the energy carriers that have recently attracted a lot of interest due to its potential 
as a zero emission fuel [1]. The advantages of high energy density, easy availability and safe handling/storage 
are now making methanol one of the most promising sources of hydrogen. Among the supported Pd catalysts, 
Pd/ZnO is very active and selective for methanol reaction [2]. Because PdZn alloy can be easily formed 
during reduction, so the effect of PdZn alloy particle size has been studied [3]. But the effect of Pd metal 
particle size is still unclear for methanol reaction. 
 
Methanol decomposition is an important elementary reaction during various methanol-to-hydrogen processes 
[4]. So the effect of Pd metal particle size for the methanol decomposition is very attracting over Pd/ZnO. In 
this study, we controlled the Pd particle size by adjusting the post-treatment temperature and performed the 
methanol decomposition..  
 
Materials and Methods 
Pd/ZnO was prepared by deposition-precipitate method with 2%wt Pd loading. In the post-treatment, 
the Pd/ZnO was first reduced in H2, and then calcined in N2 at different temperatures. The methanol 
decomposition was performed using a microreactor at a partial pressure of 26.7 kPa (200 torr) and a WHSV 
(weight hourly space velocity, g MeOH/g catalyst/h) of 2.1 h -1. The Pd sites were tested by CO pulse 
chemsorption on AutoChem II 2920. The temperature programmed reduction (TPR) was carried out on our 
homemade system. The XRD analysis was performed by using a Cu Kα radiation (Shimadzu XRD-6000).  
 
Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 shows the XRD results of Pd/ZnO with different post-treatment temperature. The Pd particle 
size increased with the increase of post-treatment temperature. So we can successfully control the Pd particle 
size by post-treatment. From the TPR results (in Figure 2), we found that the Pd/ZnO was easily reduced even 
at room temperature. In order to keep Pd in metal phase, we reduced the Pd/ZnO catalysts at room 
temperature during methanol decomposition and other characterization process. From the methanol 
decomposition results (in Figure 3), we found that the activity decreased with the increase of post-treatment 
temperature. 
The decrease in activity may be due to the Pd particle sintering. In order to reveal the intrinsic activity of the 
catalyst, TOF (turn over frequency) was calculated as shown in Figure 4. The active site was determined by 
CO adsorption. The TOF value increased first, and then reached almost stable. It is suggested that the
