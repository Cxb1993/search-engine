Abstract 
In this proposal, presents a microcomputer-based ultrasonic temperature sensor system to 
measure the temperature of air conditioner (AC) in an automobile. It uses the ultrasonic 
measurement of the changes in speed of sound in the air to determine the temperature of bulk 
air. The changes in speed of sound are calculated by combining time-of-flight (TOF) and 
phase shift techniques. This method can work in a wider range than using phase shift alone 
and is more accurate than TOF scheme. In the proposed system, we use 40 kHz ultrasonic 
transducers and adopt the single-pass operation. A 89c51 single-chip microcomputer-based 
binary frequency shift-keyed (BFSK) signal generator and phase detector are designed to 
record and calculate TOF, phase shift of the two frequencies and temperature. These data are 
then sent to either an LCD display or to a PC for calibration and examination. Experimental 
results show that the proposed measurement system has high accuracy of 0.4  from 0 
 to 80   and can reflect the temperature change instantly within 100 ms.

Method 
The ultrasonic temperature sensor system used by automobile AC is shown in figure 1. The 
ultrasonic transmitter is placed on the central ceiling of the automobile while the receiver is 
located on the instrument panel. The distance between transmitter and receiver is 100 cm. 
This way the average temperature of bulk air in front of the passengers can be correctly 
measured. 
■  Transmitter and receiver 
The transmitted and received signals are shown in figure 2. TS  is the transmitting signal 
from BFSK. It has two frequencies  and  as shown in figure 2(a). 1f 2f rT  is the period of 
TS .   is the received signal corresponding to the transmitted signal in figure 2(b). RS
■  TOF calculation 
In figure 4 , the elapsed time , which is the travel time of the signal from the transmitter to 
the receiver, can be calculated as 
t∆
12 ttt −=∆  where  is the time when transmitted signal 
changes frequency from  to , and  is the time when the corresponding received 
signal changes frequency from  to . The speed of sound can be expressed by 
1t
1f 2f 2t
1f 2f
tdc ∆= , where  is the distance between transmitter transducer and receiver transducer. d
 ■  Phase shift detection 
The detection of the phase shift is based on the two-frequency continuous wave method of 
ultrasonic distance measurement [12, 13]. The phase shift of 1φ  and 2φ  can be detected by 
the received signals corresponding to the transmitted signals. Figure 3 shows a continuous 
wave with frequency  and a received signal ( ) with frequency  and . Phase 
shift 
1f RS 1f 2f
1φ  is the difference in phase between the continuous wave and the received signal at 
. Phase shift 1f 1φ  can be calculated as 1121 )(2 Ttt −= πφ , where  is the period of the 
received signal with frequency . Similarly, phase shift 
1T
1f 2φ  is the difference in phase 
between the continuous wave and the received signal at frequency . The following will 
calculate the speed of sound by comparing the two phase shifts. Note the distance between 
transmitter transducer and receiver transducer remains unchanged.

System implementation 
The ultrasonic temperature measurement system which consists of a temperature 
controlled chamber, a thermocouple-based thermometer, two acoustic transducers with 
matching exponential horns, a signal generation system, power amplifier, preamplifier and 
gain-controlled system, frequency detected system and digital phase meter. A 
microprocessor controls the operation of the entire system and a PC will examine the 
measurement result and perform calibration. 
■ Frequency detector 
The frequency detector detects the time when frequency of received signal changes from  
(40 kHz) to  (41 kHz). The detected time is then used by the microprocessor to calculate 
TOF. Two counters are designed to distinguish the  and  frequency. The clock of 
counter #1 is the output of an AND gate with the input of  80 MHz clock and the TTL 
compatible square wave received signal. If the counted value of counter #1 is around 1000, 
then the frequency of the received signal is determined as 40 kHz, and the value around 976 
corresponding to 41 kHz. Counter #2 is used to latch and reset Counter #1 and interrupt the 
89c51 microprocessor.

■Digital phase meter 
The main function of the phase shift converter (PSC) is to convert the phase shift data into the 
pulse width with two dividers and one XOR gate. The function of the PSC follows these 
steps: 
Step 1: The 40 or 41 kHz signals are divided into 20 or 20.5 kHz. 
Step 2:  The received signals  are then divided by 2. 
Step 3:  The output of XOR gate is obtained with the input signals of 20 kHz/20.5 kHz from 
step 1 and the signals from step 2. 
The result of step 3 is the pulse width converted from the phase shift data. A counter 
based on 80 MHz oscillator is used to count the pulse width. The phase shift φ  can be 
expressed as 
T
w
P
P×= D360φ , where  is the counted value of the pulse width from the 
counter, and  is the counted value of a cycle. The range-equivalent resolution of the phase 
meter is 0.05% of the wavelength for a 40 kHz. Finally, the counter is reset by the 
microprocessor and ready for the next phase shifting.

■89c51 single-chip microprocessor

microprocessor include controlling the BFSK signals of the ultrasound, obtaining the digital 
phase shift data, calculating the TOF and the air temperature and displaying it.

ultrasonic measurement is more than adequate for the automobile AC system.
