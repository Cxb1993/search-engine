Abstract 
Multifunctional process unit is an important element in 
process intensification and reactive distillation is one of 
the most common examples of multifunctional 
processes. The objective of this work is aimed to 
provide a systematic design procedure to determine the 
process configuration, to address the scale-up issue, to 
understand the dynamical behavior of this 
multifunctional process unit. Instead of investigating 
real chemical systems, ideal chemical reaction systems 
with different relative volatility rankings will be studied. 
This provides a gradual transition as the reaction and 
separation properties change. The reaction considered is 
a reversible reaction, A+B→C+D, and this constitutes a 
quaternary system with 24 (4!) possible relative 
volatility arrangements. These 24 systems can further 
be grouped into six categories according to the ranking 
of relative volatilities of reactants and products. The 
likely process configurations will be explored and 
design will be improved based on the total annual cost 
(TAC). After addressing all possible scenarios, 
heuristic will be generated for the selection of process 
configuration, given reaction and separation properties. 
In the second year, the scale-up of reactive distillation 
will be studied. Unlike the 
commonly known scale-up principles for reactor and 
distillation column, it is less obvious that how a 
reactive distillation should be scale-up. In other words, 
how will the number of trays in the reactive zone, 
rectifying section, and stripping section vary with the 
production rates? Again, rigorous simulation will be 
used to provide optimal design under different 
production rate and heuristic will be generated for

taken to be 20 times of the tray holdup. In other 
words, the reactive holdup depends on column 
geometry and it cannot be set arbitrarily and this is 
typically true for ion-exchange resin catalyzed 
reactions. The overall reactive holdup is transformed 
into an equivalent catalyst weight and the unit price 
of Amberlyst 15 is used for cost estimation. It should 
be noted here that the amount of reactive holdup, 
consequently the Damkohler number, has important 
impact to the feasibility and design of reactive 
distillation column. 
Assumptions made in this work include: 
(1) Equimolal reactant feed is assumed, i.e., 
FROAR=FROBR where FROiR is the reactant feed flow rate. 
This implies a “neat” reactive distillation design, 
as opposed to “excess reactant” design. 
The forward reaction rate, kRFR, is specified as 8 mol/s 
at 366 K, and the backward rate, kRBR, is set to 4 mol/s 
at the same temperature (i.e., KREQR= kRFR/kRBR= 2 at 366 
K). Kinetic and physical property data are given in 
Table 1. 
2.2 Classification 
  For a quaternary system (A, B, C, and D), there are 
24 (4!) possible boiling point rankings. Here, we use 
LLK, LK, HK, and HHK to denote the component 
ranging from the lightest boiler to the heaviest boiler. 
In terms of relative volatilities, these four boilers can 
be expressed in the following order. 
LLK LK HK HHK       (8) 
Because these two reactants (A and B) are 
interchangeable and the same applies to the two 
products (C and D), this leaves us with 6 (24/2/2) 
possible configurations. According to the distribution 
of reactants and products in relative volatility ranking, 
we can further classify these six configurations into 
three types as shown in Table 2. 
Type I: One-zone. The first example is that both 
reactants are LK and HK, and this leaves two 
products to be LLK and HHK, respectively. In other 
words, we have: 
1 1 2 2P R R P       where PRiR 
stands for the ith product and RRiR means the ith 
reactants. This forms a distinct zone for the reactants 
in the middle (Table 2). In this case, the product is the 
lightest component, it is denoted as Type IRpR, hereafter. 
Similarly, if two products forms one distinct zone (as 
LK and HK), while having the reactants as the LLK 
and the HHK, this is also classified as type I. 
However, one reactant is the lightest component, it is 
called Type IRrR (Table 2). In the subsequent 
development we will use 
C A B D       to 
describe Type IRpR and A C D B       to represent 
Type IRrR. 
Type II: Two-zone. The second situation is that the 
relative volatilities of the two reactants and the two 
products are adjacent to each other, and this forms 
two distinct zones for the reactants and the products 
in the relative volatility ranking as shown in Table 2. 
The first example is that the products are LLK and 
LK and two reactants are HK and HHK, respectively. 
That implies: 
1 2 1 2P P R R      .  Because one of 
the products is the lightest component, it is denoted 
as Type IIRpR. On the contrary, if the reactants are LLK 
and LK and two products are HK and HHK, we have 
Type IIRrR. Table 2 shows Type IIRrR with two distinct 
zones in the relative volatility ranking. Here, we use 
A B C D       to describe Type IIRrR.  
Type III: Alternating. The third type corresponds to 
the situation when the relative volatility ranking is 
arranged in an alternating manner for the reactants 
and the products as shown in Table 2. For example, if 
the sequence of the relative volatility in a descending 
order is: product 1, reactant 1, product 2, and reactant 
2 (i.e., 
1 1 2 2P R P R      ), we have the case of 
Type IIIRpR. On the contrary, if the reactants are LLK 
and HK and two products are LK and HHK, we have 
Type IIIRrR. Table 2 shows four possible combinations 
for Type IIIRrR, and, here, we use A C B D       to 
represent Type IIIRrR. 
3、 Process configurations 
Before getting into exploring process configuration, 
the design procedure is outlined first. The design 
variables (e.g., location of reactive zone, tray 
numbers, feed locations etc.) are identified first and 
then all combinations are exhausted to find the 
finalized designP19 P. The objective function for design 
is the total annual cost (TAC) and the specifications 
are 95% purity level for the products. The design 
problem can be formulated as:

 (9) 
where X is the vector of design variables and the 
TAC is defined as:  
capital cost
TAC= operating cost +
payback year
 (10) 
Here, a payback year of 3 is used. The formula for 
the TAC computation is taken from Kaymak and 
Luyben. As a result of different relative volatility 
rankings, process configurations may vary from one 
column to two columns with different product 
withdraw location. Here, we use a type I example, 
type IRpR, to illustrate the design procedure.

everything being equal (from heuristics H1 and H2), 
the relative volatility between reactants is also a useful 
measure. 
Heuristic H3: Prefer the case when the relative 
volatility between two reactants are small (preferably 
not separated by products). The explanation is that: one 
can have higher reactant concentrations which is 
favorable for the forward reaction. 
The three Heuristics presented here are somewhat 
straightforward and can be combined into one: “prefer 
the case that reactants are intermediate with a small 
difference of relative volatility and products are the 
most and the least volatile with a large difference of 
relative volatility.” The flowsheet with the lowest TAC 
(type IRpR) is favored by all 3 heuristic (reactant not the 
lightest one, relative volatility between two products is 
the largest, and relative volatility between two products 
is the smallest), while the flowsheet with the highest 
TAC (type IRrR) is a difficult reactive distillation as 
suggested by the heuristics (reactant being the lightest 
one, relative volatility between two products is the 
smallest, and relative volatility between two products is 
the largest). 
4.2 Temperature control structures 
4.2.1 Temperature control of HM process: 
In the 1st column (RDC), the MeAc azeotrope feed is 
flow controlled and ratio to the recycle flow rates from 
the 3rd column (step (5)). There is no outlet from the 
column top and the liquid level in the reflux drum is 
controlled by reflux flow rates. One selected tray 
temperature is controlled by the heat input in the 
column bottom. In the 2nd column, the reflux ratio in 
the top is fixed and also one tray temperature is selected 
to be controlled by the heat input. The stoichiometric 
balance is maintained by adjusting the fresh water feed 
flow rate via column base level control (step (6)). Thus, 
the reflux ratio in the 3rd column’s top is used for 
controlling one selected tray temperature. Figure 3(a) 
shows the complete control structures for HM flow 
sheet. 
4.2.2 Temperature control of EM process: 
Similar to the HM process, the MeAc azeotrope feed is 
flow controlled and enters to the 1st column. The reflux 
flow rate is controlled and proportioned to the feed 
rates. A selected tray temperature is controlled by heat 
input. In the 2nd column (RDC), the pure butanol is 
also flow controlled and proportioned to the flow rates 
that from the 1PstP column. In order to maintain the 
stoichiometric balance, one tray temperature in RDC is 
used to adjust the ratio of pure butanol feeds (step (6)). 
The reflux flow rate is proportioned to the rate of 
recycle stream (step (5)) so the reflux ratio is fixed. A

controlled variables, manipulated variable and tuning 
parameters for three plant-wide processes under 
temperature control.  
4.2.5 Temperature Control Performance 
Performing dynamic simulation using AspenDynamics, 
a third-order 0.5 minute time lag is assumed for 
temperature measurement (Luyben et al., 1998). Liquid 
level is controlled using proportional-only controller. 
Proportional-integral controllers are used for flow, 
pressure, and temperature controls. Two scenarios are 
used for testing control performances, one is changing 
the throughput manipulates 20% and the other is 
changing the feed composition. Figure 5(a) and Figure 
5(b) show the dynamic performance for HM flow sheet. 
In Figure 5(a), it shows that the throughput is changed 
immediately at the 1 PstP hour. The feed of fresh water 
(FH2O) also changed dramatically at the 1st hour due 
to the changed of bottom level of the 3rd column but it 
could be stabilized in 5 hours. Also the temperature 
controls do the quite good jobs for each column; the 
heat inputs of all the columns could regulate 
temperatures quickly. The compositions of products 
(Figure (a), XB2,HAc and XD3,MeOH) may have 
small offsets (~ 0.5 mol %) when all loops are settled. 
The same observations could be seen in scenario of 
changing feed composition that is settled fast in ten 
hours but the products qualities also have very small 
offsets. Figure 6 shows the dynamic performances of 
TM process. A little more dynamic oscillations are 
preformed than in HM process but all the temperature 
control loops still could be settled in 5 hours. Again the 
compositions of products (Figure 6, XB2,HAc and 
XD3,MeOH) have small offsets. For the case of 
changing throughout manipulates (Figure 6(a)), there is 
about 0.5 mol % and 0.2 mol % less for changing the 
feed composition (Figure 6(b)). Figure 7 shows the 
dynamic performances for EA system. The dynamic 
behaves are similar with that in HM process. Again all 
the temperature control loops can be settled in 5 hours 
and the dynamic responses are very symmetrical. The 
controller performances are even better for the case of 
changing the feed composition. A significant different 
is that for the final composition of product (dimethyl 
adipate, XB3,DMA). Unlike HM and TM processes, 
the 3rd column in EA process just separates both main 
products (H2Oand DMA). The difference of the boiling 
temperatures for these two products is quite large 
(Table 1). We may observe that the azeotrope 
(DMA/H2O, 0.0105/0.9895) is quite close to pure 
water and is also in two-phase region Hung et al. 
(2006a). Therefore, there is almost nil offset for the 
quality of products. According the above results, 
temperature control structure are good enough for EA 
process due to fast response and no steady-state offset. 
But one may seek for the better temperature control or 
offset-free composition control in the other two systems 
that is step (8) in the design principals. Next we will 
discuss the improving control structures. 
5、 Conclusions 
In this paper, the effects of relative volatilities rankings 
to the design of reactive distillation are explored, and 
ideal reactive distillation (RD) systems are used to 
illustrate the process flowsheet generation as the 
ranking varies. For a quaternary system with second 
order reversible reaction (A+B=C+D), 24 all possible 
relative volatility rankings are classified into three 
process types based on the distribution of reactants and 
products in the relative volatility sequence (type I: 
one-zone, type II: two-zone, and type III: alternating). 
Each type is further denoted by subscript p or r 
according to the nature (product or reactant) the lightest 
component. A systematic design procedure is used to 
generate process flowsheet as the relative volatility 
ranking changes and the total annual cost (TAC) is used 
to evaluate appropriateness of different designs. The 
assumptions made in this work include: (1) ideal VLE, 
(2) equal molar feed (neat process), (3) reactive holdup 
set by column diameter, and (4) sequential approach for 
optimization. It is interesting to note that the reactive 
zone can be placed at the upper section, lower section, 
middle, or opposite-end of the reactive distillation 
column, depending on the sequences of relative
