 一、 簡介 
1.1  研究動機 
活性碳支撐金屬觸媒長久以來就是應用於特用化學品工業【E.Auer, et al., 
1998】。由於其具備 (1) 耐酸鹼 (2) 高表面積且對有機物質具高吸附之能力，因此，
廣泛的應用於濕式氧化程序中以處理含有機酸之廢水，然而我們在前期研究中發現：
含甲醇廢水氧化，當 T＞160℃時，活性有明顯之衰退（圖 1.1）；而由圖 1.2，廢觸媒
之 EXAFS，可知隨著反應溫度壓力的提高，金屬聚集的程度越大；圖 1.3，反應前後
之 TEM 圖，發現反應後之觸媒其金屬顆粒明顯聚集，由以上所述可得知在濕式氧化
下，由於活性碳被鉑金屬催化氧化造成活性碳表面的碎裂，致使金屬與擔體之間的作
用力減弱，造成鉑金屬遷移而產生聚集(agglomeration)；鉑金屬聚集形成大顆粒後，
使活性的衰退，產生失活的現象(如圖 1.4 所示)。 
    金屬聚集則是利用氯氧化再分散方法將大顆粒的鉑金屬分散為小顆粒
【S.E.Wanke,etal.1986;S.C.Fung,1996,1999】，達到恢復觸媒的活性。因為再分散反應
較為複雜且理論的探討亦不多且不夠完整，加上有關於鉑金屬支撐於活性碳觸媒再分
散還沒有文獻記載，所以引發了我們的研究動機。

1.2 研究目的 
    在本研究中的目的除了了解支撐式鉑觸媒再分散的機制外，亦將探討不同的再分
散操作條件(氯氧化再分散反應溫度)對觸媒結構的影響，藉以提昇以活性碳為擔體之
支撐式鉑觸媒在濕式氧化上的應用效益。 
    為簡化系統，我們利用 steaming 的前處理方式，使新鮮觸媒上的鉑金屬顆粒產
生高度聚集，之後再藉由氯氧化再分散實驗的進行，進而了解氯氧化再分散反應之基
本現象及再分散的主要機制，例如：再分散之開始過程鉑金屬形成何種物質、金屬與
擔體間的交互作用、和氯氧化再分散反應之最適操作條件。而在觸媒研究方面， 
EXAFS 可了解金屬觸媒(Supported metal catalyst)的金屬顆粒結構、金屬與擔體
(Support)間之交互作用，進而得知觸媒的結構與催化之關係，故也唯有仰賴 EXAFS
之光譜分析才能了解其發生之現象，進而了解支撐式鉑觸媒再分散之可能機制。上述
之分析方法將有助於我們分析在相異之再分散條件下鉑金屬結構的變化，並探討再分
散反應的基本現象、反應機制與研究最佳之再分散條件，藉由再分散之基本化學原理
的了解，進而發展出觸媒最適化之再生技術，藉此提昇鉑金屬支撐於活性碳觸媒使用
之效益。 
 
二、研究方法 
2.1  鉑金屬觸媒之製備 
一般負載型觸媒的製備方式可略分為以下幾種，常見的方法有微濕含浸法
( incipient wetness impregnation )、浸濕含浸法( dipping or wetsoaking impregnation )與
離子交換法( ion exchange )。所謂微濕含浸法乃是將相當於載體孔洞體積之觸媒源種
溶液，逐滴加至載體上以潤濕載體，最後再加以乾燥或鍛燒。而浸濕含浸法與離子交
換法則是將載體含浸於觸媒源種溶液中，將溶液攪拌混合均勻，使觸媒源種固定或吸
附於載體之上，之後將溶劑除去並加以乾燥或鍛燒，即可得到載體型觸媒。上述方法
之目的乃在於提高觸媒源種在載體上之分散度，增加觸媒的有效表面積，但是除了分
散度的考量之外，載體結構的完整與否也是很重要的，因為它對觸媒的活性與產物的

     Structure , EXAFS)光譜數據分析 
    我們將 steaming 方式所製得之快速失活而金屬聚集之觸媒，進行不同氯氧化再分
散反應溫度後之再分散完全觸媒，進行 EXAFS 分析。在分析圖譜之前，我們先經由
表 3.1 瞭解鉑金屬可能結構的配位半徑： 
由上表可知Pt的原子半徑為1.38 Å，而Cl的原子半徑為0.92 Å，所以我們就可求得Pt-Cl
的配位半徑為 1.38 Å +0.92 Å =2.40 Å，而其他配位半徑則以此類推。有了以上資訊我
們才能開始對EXAFS圖譜進行分析，圖 3.1 為再分散完全後樣品之EXAFS圖譜，它是
k＝3.5～12 Å-1的範圍，並經由k1加權、Pt-Cl相位校正所獲得的傅立葉轉換圖譜，它
的橫軸表示配位半徑，縱軸則與配位數成正比，在 2.04 Å的位置有一負相位波峰，它
屬於Pt-O的第一層配位貢獻，這個波峰之配位半徑與PtO2中的Pt-O之配位半徑相一致
【ICSD】。而在 2.40 Å有一正相位的波峰，經由文獻我們可知它屬於Pt-Cl的第一層貢
獻【Normand et.al.,1996】，它剛好跟Pt-O的貢獻有 180˚的相位差。接著在 2.76 及 3.3 Å
處各有一波峰，它是屬於Pt-Pt的第一層貢獻【Koningsberger et al., 1998】、【Asakura, 
1995】，它之所以會有兩個波峰是因為Pt-Pt的振幅函數並非一線性函數，若用一線性
的相位校正就會造成如此結果。接下來我們看到大約在 2.8Å左右有一相當對稱之正
相位的shoulder (400  sample℃ )，由表 3.5 可知它可能是屬於Pt-O-Cl的貢獻。由以上結
果我們獲得鉑原子在再分散後周圍結構的資訊，我們發現其有Pt-O及Pt-Cl的第一層貢
獻及Pt-O-Cl貢獻。 
    由以上所得到的資訊，我們可以推測氯氧化再分散反應的可能機制如以下所列： 
  2 C2H4Cl2  +   5 O2  ＝＞  4 CO2 + 2 H2O + 4 HCl         (1) 
   Ptx (Pt clusters)  +  x O2  ＜＝＞  (PtO2) x               (2) 
   2 HCl  +  ½ O2   ＜＝＞  Cl2   +  H2O                (3) 
 (PtO2)x  +  2x HCl  ＜＝＞ x PtCl2  + x H2O + x/2 O2        (4) 
                  Cl2＜＝＞  2 Cl·                        (5) 
  (PtO2) x  +  2x Cl·   ＝＞2x Pt-O-Cl                      (6)

的提高，表示有大量的氣體產生，經由氣相層析儀(GC)判斷氣體為二氧化碳，故得知
這個在溫度時活性碳有大量的氧化情形。而 Pt/C(Dot Line)則是在約 400℃之後訊號就
明顯的提高，代表著因為鉑金屬的加入，催化氧化了活性碳，而使活性碳之含氧官能
基增加。而活性碳氧化後所造成的結果有：(1)由於含氧官能基之親水性，因此，將
使水分子聚集於官能基附近而使鉑金屬與活性碳之親合力降低，而在氯氧化再分散反
應中隨溫度提昇之狀況下，鉑金屬顆粒將因遷移而產生聚集。(2)由於活性碳的燃燒，
造成孔道結構的破壞，進而使表面積的減少，而導致鉑金屬顆粒的聚集。由此結果可
知圖 3.10 中之氯氧化再分散反應溫度 500℃ 之 sample，其鉑金屬顆粒相較於其他處
理溫度突然聚集成大顆粒的原因，就是因為在高溫環境中造成的孔道結構破壞，及鉑
金屬催化氧化活性碳造成活性碳從疏水性變成親水性，導致鉑金屬與活性碳之間親合
力下降，這兩種原因造成了氯氧化再分散反應溫度 500℃之 sample，其鉑金屬顆粒大
小大於未經再分散之觸媒的鉑金屬顆粒大小。 
 
3.3 再分散機制 
    由以上所述，由 EXAFS 結果我們獲得鉑原子在再分散後周圍結構的資訊，我們
發現其有 Pt-O 及 Pt-Cl 的第一層貢獻及 Pt-O-Cl 貢獻，由所得到之資訊，我們可以推
測氯氧化再分散反應的可能機制。另外，我們可以得到當氯氧化再分散反應溫度在
200℃至 400℃之間，隨著反應溫度的增加，鉑金屬顆粒尺寸越小，也就是說氯氧化
再分散反應效果越好。但當溫度高於 400℃時，因為伴隨著活性碳的燃燒，表面結構
遭受到破壞，以及鉑金屬催化氧化活性碳造成活性碳親水性的增加，而導致鉑金屬顆
粒開始有相當大程度的聚集，因此可在圖 3.2 中可觀察到當反應溫度達到 500℃時其
鉑金屬顆粒有明顯的聚集現象。故以鉑金屬活性碳觸媒而言，氯氧化再分散反應在考
慮到活性碳燃燒溫度及其再分散的效果之考量下，最佳的操作溫度是在未達到鉑金屬
活性碳觸媒開始燃燒之前的溫度，因此，我們選擇 300℃當作鉑金屬活性碳觸媒進行
氯氧化再分散反應之最佳操作溫度。

3.4 老化性能測試 
    在濕式氧化之過程中，觸媒活性衰減的原因是由於活性碳亦同時被鉑催化氧化，
而使含氧之官能基增加。由於含氧官能基之親水性，因此，將使水分子聚集於官能基
附近而使鉑與活性碳之親合力降低。在溫度提昇之狀況下鉑金屬顆粒為將因遷移而產
生聚集，因而使得觸媒之活性為之下降。【Chang et al., 2006】 
    因為鉑金屬聚集成大顆粒，其鉑金屬表面積的減少，造成活性點的減少，進而導
致觸媒活性的衰減。因此，利用再分散的方式，將大顆粒的鉑金屬叢，變為小顆粒的
鉑金屬顆粒之後，其鉑金屬表面積增加，活性點跟著增加，因而恢復了觸媒的活性，
達到觸媒再生之目的。 
我們將以新鮮鉑金屬活性碳觸媒進行老化性能測試(濕式氧化反應)，而反應後所
得之廢觸媒則利用氯氧化再分散反應進行再生，再生後之鉑金屬活性碳觸媒再進行一
次老化性能測試(濕式氧化反應)，藉以比較再分散後之活性表現。老化測試反應其操
作條件是溫度 180℃，壓力 20 大氣壓，WHSV = 6 hr-1，並以 0.25wt％的甲醇溶液作
為廢水，進行濕式氧化反應來測試觸媒的活性衰減之情形；而氯氧化再分散反應之條
件則採用上述 3.2 節所歸納出之結論，以 300℃為其氯氧化再分散反應之最適化反應
溫度。並藉由EXAFS、XRD、XANES之分析方法來了解對於氯氧化再分散反應前後
之鉑金屬觸媒結構上的變化。

    以上述之反應條件來進行甲醇廢水之催化氧化實驗。圖 3.4 為 Pt/C 再分散前後的
甲醇轉化率關係圖。我們可以發現再分散後一開始的初濃度已比新鮮觸媒來得低，而
活性衰減的速率也比新鮮觸媒來得快，最後的平衡轉化率也比新鮮觸媒低。在下一段
中，我們將利用 EXAFS 圖譜來加以深入討論，對於氯氧化再分散反應前後之觸媒結
構上的變化。

 12
【Asakura, 1995】。由圖 3.6 與 圖 3.7 比較可推估在溫度為 300℃之氯氧化再分散反應
中，其再分散的型態不是文獻中所提到之形成Pt-O-Cl後以一顆一顆剝離型態，以發
射或擴散的方式到達活性碳表面上；而是因為溫度不夠高到讓 3.2 節中式(3)發生反
應，因而無法形成Pt-O-Cl之型態，而是形成Pt-Cl型態，形成Pt-Cl之後，其metal-support 
interaction跟著增加，因此鉑金屬顆粒形成raft結構，進而平鋪在活性碳表面上，就結
構上而言則是由大顆粒之 3-Dimensional立體結構轉變為 2-Dimensional之raft結構，因
此在圖 3.6 中，在 2.76Å仍可看到屬於Pt-Pt的第一層貢獻之正相波峰，亦可說明此論
點。接下來我們將利用XRD及XANES來輔助說明此論點。

    當某一頻率的 X 射線照在一原子上，將使原子外的電子振動在 X 射線的頻率。
此振動的電子會再放射出相同頻率的 X 射線，此散射的 X 射線分布在所有的方向。
當一規則排列的原子被 X 射線照射時，其各原子散射的 X 射線將相互干涉，在某些
方向產生加強的干涉，某些方向則產生衰減的干涉，這種現象稱為 X 射線繞射(X-ray 
diffraction)，它可以利用來分析晶體的結構【汪建民,2005】。 
    圖 3.8 是有關於老化測試反應後觸媒，經氯氧化再分散後之 XRD 圖譜，這個實
驗我們於同步中心操作，在能量 13keV 下所得的圖譜，藉由 JCPDS data base 分析，
可得知 2θ = 28.162 < 2 0 0 >之波峰是鉑金屬的特徵波峰。其中由下而上分別是老化測
試反應後之觸媒(Dot Line)，氯氧化再分散後之觸媒(Solid Line)，經過溫度 300℃氫氣
還原後之觸媒，其半波寬分別為 0.659，1.137，1.510 單位長。在 XRD 圖譜中可利用
Scherrer equation 來計算顆粒大小。

上式中：t：particle size (Å), Κ：constant  0.9, λ≒ ：wavelength, β：半波寬, θβ：為 2θ
角度之一半 
    由 Scherrer equation 可得知：XRD 圖譜中其波峰的半波寬反比於樣品顆粒大小，
 14
    由以上結果可知，以鉑金屬活性碳觸媒而言，經過溫度 300℃之氯氧化再分散反
應後，其鉑金屬無法達到完全再分散之效果，其原因是因為反應溫度不夠高到產生氯
氧化之反應，因此，無法形成 Pt-O-Cl 之型態。而溫度無法提高之理由，在於鉑金屬
活性碳觸媒在溫度 400℃開始燃燒，造成孔道結構破壞，反而導致鉑金屬顆粒的聚
集，因此，由於活性碳燃燒所造成之溫度限制，使得鉑金屬顆粒無法達到新鮮觸媒之
分散度。然而，就觸媒活性再生而言，本研究已顯然達到目的，如圖 4 所示，觸媒經
再分散後，其活性已部份恢復。

Abstract 
 
Wet air oxidation (WAO) process is effective in converting organic pollutants in 
wastewater to innocuous carbon dioxide.  Supported Pt catalysts, particularly Pt/C 
are effective but unstable.  Now a novel catalyst, Pt on TiO2 grafted carbon 
(Pt/TiO2-C) has been developed for WAO.  The catalyst is characterized by high 
activity and stability in WAO process.  By use of transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and Fourier transform 
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, the fresh and aged Pt/C catalysts were characterized 
and the mechanism of catalyst deactivation was elucidated.  The average Pt cluster 
size increased from about 2.0 to 10 nm after WAO of methanol in water at 220 °C for 
200 hrs.  These results indicated that Pt/C catalyst was deactivated due to migration 
and aggregation of the Pt clusters into large Pt particles.  The increase in the contents 
of oxygen-containing groups and carbonate species as characterized by FT-IR spectra 
in the aged catalyst further suggested that the oxidation of carbon surface decreases 
the affinity between Pt and carbon support, leading to extensive Pt aggregation.  
Thus, TiO2 was grafted on to the carbon support to anchor and keep Pt from migration 
and agglomeration, and obtain a stable Pt/TiO2-C catalyst.  The efficacy of TiO2 
grafted on activated carbon in stabilizing the Pt/C catalyst was demonstrated in the 
long-term catalytic performance tests. The evidences of the TiO2 in anchoring and 
maintaining the Pt clusters in small ensembles were further demonstrated by 
characterizing the Pt-TiO2 interactions and the morphology of Pt clusters using 
EXAFS. 
 
Keywords: grafted TiO2, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), carbon 
supported Pt catalysts, FT-IR spectroscopy, wet-air oxidation, and catalyst 
deactivation.

The efficacy of this catalyst was demonstrated based on the long-term catalytic 
performance data.  The mechanism of catalyst stabilization using grafted TiO2 was 
elucidated by use of EXAFS characterization and FT-IR techniques.  
Tryba et al. reported the preparation of TiO2-mounted activated carbon, which 
was found to be effective in removal of phenol from water under UV irradiation [15].  
According to XRD, the TiO2 particles were well-crystallized anatase with sizes of few 
µm.  Preparation of highly dispersed TiO2 on non-reducible metal oxide supports 
such as silica and MCM-41 has been reported by Srinivasan et al. [16] and Lin et al. 
[17], respectively.  The grafted TiO2 on non-reducible metal oxides has been 
prepared by reaction of surface hydroxyl groups on the metal oxides with titanium 
precursors like titanium alkoxides, followed with drying and calcinations [16-19]. 
Thus, the same approach was used to graft TiO2 on activated carbon to anchor the Pt 
clusters.  Phenolic hydroxyl groups on activated carbon can react with Ti alkoxides 
to produce Ti-O-C linkage with elimination of one alcohol and make Ti immobilize.  
However, the activated carbon should be dried before the grafting procedure in order 
to remove absorbed water on its surface such that hydrolysis of metal alkoxides in the 
latter grafting step can be avoided.  In addition, the grafting reaction should be 
carried out under inert environment to avoid the hydrolysis of metal alkoxides.   
In the study, a continuous fixed-bed reactor working in a trickle-flow regime was 
used to characterize the catalytic properties and performances of the catalyst for WAO.  
Pure water containing methanol was used as the model wastewater in order to 
decouple other effects, such as inorganic compounds on the catalytic performance. 
TEM and EXAFS spectroscopy were used to characterize the catalyst structure, while 
FT-IR spectroscopy was used to characterize functional groups of the carbon supports.

model wastewater for the aging test. The reaction was carried out at an airflow rate so 
as to maintain an O2 to methanol mole ratio of 75.  The reduced Pt/C samples were 
tested at WHSV of 6 h-1 of 4 different temperature and pressure conditions: namely, 
130±10°C and 5 atm, 160±10°C and 10 atm, 180±10°C and 20 atm, and 220±10°C 
and 40 atm; the corresponding used catalysts were noted as T130P5W6, T160P10W6, 
T180P20W6, and T220P40W6, respectively.  To keep the reaction in a trickle-flow 
regime, the pressures were increased with reaction temperatures. The reaction 
products were trapped using a condenser at –5°C and analyzed using a gas 
chromatography (Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph model GC-14A, TCD detector, 
equipped with DB-WAX capillary column and a SP4270 data processor).  After the 
test reactions, the catalysts were purged with nitrogen to remove adsorbed oxygen and 
water, and then unloaded from the reactor in nitrogen environment for 
characterization.  
In order to compare the stability between Pt/C and Pt/TiO2-C catalysts, the same 
procedures for catalyst pre-treatment, catalyst packing, and product analysis were 
applied for these two catalysts, whereas the reaction was carried out at 220±10°C, 40 
atm, and WHSV of 24 h-1. The used catalyst for Pt/C and Pt/TiO2-C catalysts are 
noted as T220P40W24 and T220P40W24(Pt/TiO2-C), respectively. 
 
2.3 FT-IR spectroscopy 
 
   Fresh and used Pt/C and Pt/TiO2-C samples were characterized by use of Infrared 
Fourier transform spectroscopy using Shimadzu FT-IR 8101M, having a spectral 
resolution of 2 cm-1 and equipped with SSU-8000 2nd sampling unit.  The wafers 
(4w% [Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2]/C or  [Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2]/TiO2-C sample in KBr) were loaded 
into an IR cell in an N2-filled glove box. The samples were pre-dried and reduced at 
the same conditions as those used for catalytic performance tests.  After the 
treatments, IR spectra were recorded.  For the used catalyst samples, the samples 
were purged with N2 at room temperature to remove adsorbed species before IR 
spectrum measurement.  
 
2.4 X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
 
The x-ray absorption measurements were performed on the wiggler beamline 
BL17C at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan.  The 
electron storage ring was operated at an energy level of 1.5 GeV and a beam current 
between 120 and 200 mA.  A Si (111) double-crystal monochromator was employed 
for energy selection, and mirrors rejected higher harmonic radiation.  The

3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 Catalytic performance of Pt/C and Pt/TiO2-C in wet air oxidation of methanol 
 
 In the WAO process, essentially, the entire methanol is converted to CO2 as 
shown in the following equation.  
CH3OH + 3/2 O2   →   CO2 + 2H2O 
Because of the high conversion levels, methanol oxidation in WAO can be 
regarded as a total oxidation.  
For Pt/C catalyst, the activity is high but the stability becomes poor at higher 
temperatures. The conversion of methanol in the model wastewater as a function of 
time on stream at a temperature range of 130 to 220°C is shown in Figure 1.  The 
figure shows that the initial catalyst activity was high and total oxidation of methanol 
was achieved, in consistent with the works of Cheng et al. [20]. However, in the aging 
test for extended period of operation, the catalyst activity was maintained only at the 
reaction temperature below 160°C and decreased gradually at the reaction temperature 
above 180°C.  These results indicate that Pt/C catalysts are stable at lower reaction 
temperatures, say, below 160 °C but deactivated at 180 °C or higher. 
The conversion of methanol is shown as a function of time on stream in the flow 
reactor at WHSV of 24 h–1, 220 °C and 40 atm for Pt/C and Pt/TiO2-C catalysts 
(Figure 2).  The initial conversion of methanol for the Pt/TiO2-C catalyst sample was 
higher than that for the Pt/C catalyst, with conversion of 97 and 92% respectively.  
While the conversion for Pt/TiO2-C remained rather constant, the conversion for Pt/C 
fell sharply with on stream time.  
 The external mass transfer limitation was examined by the methanol conversion 
over the Pt/C catalysts, carried out at a constant WHSV (24 h-1) with variable 
superficial mass flow velocities, us, ranging from 2 to 40 g/cm2.h-1; where us = (mass 
flow rate, g/h)/ (inside cross section of the reactor, cm2) (porosity of catalyst bed).  
The experimental results indicated that methanol conversion increased with 
superficial velocities; the methanol conversions were 0.46, 0.76, 0.92, 0.94, 0.95 for 
superficial mass velocities of 4, 10, 20, 40, 80 g/cm2.h-1, respectively.  In addition, 
when the catalyst was pulverized from 1.5 mm to about 0.1 mm, the conversion 
increased from 0.92 to 0.96 for the superficial mass velocity of 20 g/cm2.h-1.  These 
results suggested that the tests for the comparison of the stability between Pt/C and 
Pt/TiO2-C catalysts were operated in the regimes of combined chemical reaction and 
mass transfer control.  
 Because the purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the grafted TiO2 in 
improving the catalytic properties of Pt/C catalysts, rigorous kinetic analysis was not

morphology of the Pt clusters.  A k 3-weighted Pt-Pt phase and amplitude corrected 
Fourier transformed EXAFS function [23, 24] over the range 4.0 < k < 14.0 Å-1 for the 
fresh and used catalyst samples were shown in Figure 5.  The result shows that the 
peaks corresponding to the first metal-metal shell (at about 2.8 Å) and higher shells 
(about 3.9, 4.9 and 5.6 Å) are at the same positions and consistent with the nearest 
four neighbors in bulk fcc (face centered cubic) Pt.  The amplitude of peak at R=2.8 
Å for the used catalyst samples, T180P20W6 and T220P40W6, is larger than that for 
the fresh catalyst sample. Since the amplitude of the Fourier transformed EXAFS 
function peaking at about 2.8 Å reflects the metal particle size [22, 25, 26], the results 
indicate that Pt particles were agglomerated during the reaction at temperatures higher 
than 160 °C. Furthermore, the growth of Pt particle size increased with elevating 
reaction temperatures. Since significant catalyst deactivation has also been observed 
at reaction temperatures higher than 160 °C, the results suggest that metal aggregation 
is one of the factors in catalyst deactivation.  
The results of XANES suggest that Pt was partially oxidized and existed in a high 
oxidation state.  The XANES intensity should decrease with increase in Pt particle 
size, as shown by Bazin et al. [27].  In contrast to this expectation, the experimental 
results showed that the metal aggregated samples (T180P20W6 and T220P40W6) 
presented higher XANES intensity than that for the fresh catalyst (Figure 4 and 5).  
The results can be rationalized by the fact that the higher the oxidation states of the 
metal, the greater the probability of the transition, and the higher the intensity of 
XANES [23].  Thus, we are tempted to conclude that Pt is partially oxidized in the 
WAO reaction.             
The formation of platinum oxides during the reaction was further confirmed by 
detail EXAFS analysis.  A k2-weighted Fourier transformation was performed on the 
EXAFS function over the range 3.0 < k < 14.5 Å-1.  The major contributions were 
isolated by inverse Fourier transformation of the data in the ranges of 1.15 < r < 3.25 
Å.  At the beginning, the structural parameters characteristic of the Pt-Pt contribution 
were roughly determined by fitting the k3-weighted Fourier isolated EXAFS function 
in the range 6.0 < k < 14.0 Å-1 to de-emphasize the low-Z contribution, Pt-O.  An 
EXAFS function calculated from these parameters was then subtracted from the raw 
data (Fourier isolated EXAFS function).  The residual spectra were expected to 
represent the contributions from platinum-support interactions and/or platinum 
oxides. For the fresh Pt/C sample the Pt-O phase-corrected Fourier transform of the 
residual spectra displayed a peak at about 2.2 Å (Figure 6).  The interaction between 
metal and surface oxygen on many metal oxides, such as MgO, Al2O3, and SiO2 has 
been characterized with metal-support oxygen distances of 2.1±0.1 Å (Pt-Os) [28, 29].  
Based on these results, we inferred the peak at about 2.2 Å to be the contribution from 
 12
may attract water molecules through H-bonding, which could reduce the affinity 
between Pt clusters and activated carbon, leading to migration of Pt clusters. The 
collisions between the mobile metal clusters offer the opportunity for the 
agglomeration of metal clusters to occur.  At higher reaction temperatures, the 
mobility of Pt clusters was enhanced by the reaction of oxygen with carbon to form 
CO2, leading to an agglomeration of Pt clusters.  The adsorbed gases could lift the 
migrating Pt clusters, causing them to float over the carbon surface.  The mechanism 
was proposed by Baker [36].  Baker and co-workers found that Pd and Pt crystallites 
as large as 100 nm migrated at high temperatures in the presence of oxygen or 
hydrogen, leaving deep channels on carbon surface [36]. 
For a typical oxidation reaction, a significant amount of reaction heat is 
generated.  Notwithstanding the heat of reaction can be removed rapidly by the 
trickle-bed reaction system, the local heat generated from the exothermic reaction 
facilitates the inevitable catalytic combustion of activated carbon. In the reaction 
system, the surface properties of the catalysts will thus be altered by the oxidation of 
activated carbon itself, leading to change in metal-support affinities and morphology 
of Pt clusters.   
   
3.4 Mechanism of Pt/C catalyst deactivation 
 
It has been reported that oxidation of volatile organics catalyzed by noble metals 
undergoes the dissociative adsorption of oxygen first and then follow with direct 
reaction the dissociated oxygen with the reactant [37].  The reduced metallic Pt 
clusters are regarded to be the active centers for the catalytic oxidation [38].  As 
shown in the above section, Pt clusters grow under the WAO reaction condition, 
leading to loss in Pt surface area and active centers.  Thus, we are tempted to 
conclude that the Pt migration and Pt cluster growth are the main mechanism of Pt/C 
catalyst deactivation.  However, the formation of platinum oxides during the 
reactions as evidenced by x-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that 
oxidation-reduction mechanism [2, 39] cannot be ruled out as the mechanism of Pt/C 
deactivation. The possible steps of the mechanism are: (1) methanol adsorbs on 
platinum and/or platinum oxides, (2) the adsorbed methanol reduces platinum oxides 
to platinum concomitantly with the formation of carbon dioxide and water, (3) 
platinum oxides were formed by the reaction of adsorbed oxygen with platinum, and 
(4) the adsorption strength for the adsorbed species may increase with the formation 
of metal oxides and the reaction rate may be retarded by the strong adsorption.  
Nikvo and Paev have attributed the deactivation of Pd/alumina catalysts for glucose 
wet-oxidation to the formation of PdO [40].  In this study, our experimental results 
 14
presence of Ti-Ti of average bond distance of 2.78 Å and coordination number of 4.4 
suggesting an aggregated TiO2 species is formed on the carbon surface (Table 2a).  
The local structure of TiO2 was further characterized by X-ray absorption near 
edge structure (XANES) at Ti K edge.  As shown in Figure 9b, TiO2-C showed a 
clear pre-edge absorption peak at 4971 ev and two rather small shoulders at 4968 and 
4973 ev, respectively. This is different from that for anatase, which shows three 
low-intensity pre-edge peaks and one shoulder at edge-jump.  It is general accepted 
that pre-edge spectrum at Ti K edge reveals the symmetry of TiO2 [43].  Octahedral 
symmetry of Ti(IV)-A1g-T2g or A1g-Eg are symmetry (Laporte) forbidden and have a 
lower intensity, whereas tetrahedral symmetry of A1-T2 transition is allowed and 
intensive.  Hence, combining EXAFS and XANES results, we suggest that most 
aggregated TiO2 species are monolayer and have a tetrahedral coordination, while 
small amount of TiO2 was in a structure resembling anatase with an octahedral 
coordination.  Based on the structure of TiO2 estimated by EXAFS, at least 1.8 g of 
TiO2 per gram of carbon are necessary to cover the carbon surface fully with 
monolayer of TiO2, which is far more than that used for the preparation of TiO2-C in 
this study. 
 
Pt clusters were anchored on the polymeric TiO2 as evidenced by the Ti-Pt 
contributions.  The EXAFS contribution from the Pt-TiO2 interaction was estimated 
by difference file technique [32].  The structural parameters of Ti-O and Ti-Ti 
contributions were first estimated by calculating the EXAFS function that agree as 
closely as possible with the experimental EXAFS results of Pt/TiO2-C in r space 
ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 Å.  EXAFS functions of Ti-O and Ti-Ti were calculated 
from the estimated structural parameters and the residual spectrum was expected to be 
contributed the Ti-Pt contribution.  A symmetric peak appears at about 3.2 Å after 
Ti-Pt phase-corrected Fourier Transform was performed on the residual spectrum 
(Figure 10). For an X-Y absorber-backscattering pair, peak, which has a positive 
imaginary part of the phase-corrected EXAFS function, are due to neighbors of type 
Y [44].  These results confirmed that Pt is the backscattering atom and indicated that 
Pt clusters were anchored on the aggregated TiO2.  
Detail EXAFS analysis at Pt edge for the Pt/TiO2-C is similar to that for Pt/C 
sample except Pt-Ti contribution has been considered.  Hence, after the subtraction 
of Pt-Pt contributions from raw data, the residual spectrum was expected to represent 
the interactions between Pt clusters and the aggregated TiO2 including Pt-Osupport and 
Pt-Ti.  The structural parameters of Pt-Pt, Pt-O, and Pt-Ti were thus estimated by a 
nonlinear least-square multiple-shell fitting routine and the fitting results are 
summarized in Table 2b. 
 16
It has been claimed in a patent that the CO tolerance and stability of 
carbon-supported Pt or Pt-Ru catalyst used in fuel cell can be increased by the 
addition of TiO2 [45].  Even though the reasons for the improvement in catalytic 
performance by addition of TiO2are unclear, we suspect that anchoring of Pt by 
grafted TiO2 might play an important role.  Moreover, it has been reported in the 
literature that strong metal-support interactions induced by high temperature reduction 
may alter the phase of active sites resulting in a change in catalytic properties [46,47].  
Hence, further studies on grafted TiO2 and the effects of treatment temperature on 
strong metal-support interactions could be interesting in the fuel cell research.    
 
3.8 Other possible mechanism 
 
 Since Pt clusters were anchored on the grafted TiO2, we might expect that the 
grafted TiO2 play a role as insulator to minimize the catalytic combustion of carbon 
by keeping Pt clusters from direct contact with carbon support.  However, as show in 
Figure 12, the peaks characterizing oxygen-containing functional groups on activated 
carbon increased after aging test reactions, indicating that carbon is burned which is 
contrary to our initial expectation.  Those results thus suggested that, while this 
mechanism might not be ruled out, anchoring of Pt on TiO2 to maintain it in small 
clusters during the WAO reactions is the main reason for the improvement in the 
catalyst stability.  
 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Activated carbon supported platinum catalysts, Pt/C, are high in activity and 
selectivity for WAO reaction. However, its stability is very sensitive to the reaction 
temperature.  When the reaction temperatures are 180 °C or higher, the catalyst 
deactivated rapidly right after the start of run. Based on characterization of the fresh 
and used catalysts by use of FT-IR, EXAFS, CO chemisorption, and TEM, the rapid 
catalyst deactivation at high temperatures was determined to be the consequence of Pt 
migration and agglomeration, resulting from catalytic combustion of carbon supports.  
From industrial application point of view, it is most crucial to develop catalysts, 
which maintain high activity for long-term operation.  Hence, the performance of the 
Pt/C catalyst was improved by grafting TiO2 on the carbon support.  The TiO2 on the 
carbon was found to be an excellent anchor for the Pt.  By anchoring Pt on TiO2, Pt 
clusters were kept in small size and the catalyst activity was maintained in high level 
during the extended period of reaction.
