for short). Two spanning trees in a graph G are
said to be independent if they are rooted at the
same node r and such that, for each node v 6= r
in G, the two different paths from v to r, one
path in each tree, are internally node-disjoint. A
set of spanning trees of G is independent if they
are pairwise independent.
In [29], Zehavi and Itai conjectured that for
any node r in a k-connected graph G, there exist
k ISTs of G rooted at r. Therefore, all subse-
quent researches devoted to the construction of a
set of ISTs with any node r as the common root
and such that the cardinality of the set of ISTs
matches the connectivity of G. Although the
problem is hard for general graphs, the conjec-
ture has been confirmed for k-connected graphs
with k 6 4 (see [15] for k = 2, [4, 29] for k = 3,
and [5] for k = 4). Also, several results are
known for some special classes of graphs. Es-
pecially, the graph classes related to interconnec-
tion networks, such as product graphs [21], pla-
nar graphs [12], chordal rings [16, 25], deBruijn
and Kautz graphs [10, 13], hypercubes [23, 28],
star graphs [22], recursive circulant graphs [26,27]
and multidimensional torus [24]. There is a sur-
prise to us that till now no further results related
to ISTs have been acquired for other variations
of hypercubes. In this project, we will prove that
n+1 edge-disjoint spanning trees constructed by
Ho [11] for n-dimensional folded hypercubes are
indeed independent spanning trees.
The rest of this project is organized as follows.
Section 2 formally gives the definition of folded
hypercubes and introduces the constructing rules
of spanning trees proposed by Ho in [11]. Sec-
tion 3 proves the independency of the constructed
spanning trees. The final section contains our
concluding remarks.
2 Constructing spanning trees in
folded hypercubes
An n-dimensional hypercube, denoted by Qn,
is a graph consisting of N = 2n vertices repre-
sented by binary strings of length n from 0 to
2n − 1. Two vertices in Qn are adjacent if and
only if their corresponding binary strings differ in
exactly one bit. An n-dimensional folded hyper-
cube, denoted by FQn, is basically a Qn enhanced
with extra links between any two nodes whose bi-
nary strings are complements of each other. Fig-
ure 1 shows the graph FQ4, where dotted lines
represent complement links. El-Amawy and Lat-
ifi [6] showed that FQn is (n+1)-regular (n+1)-
connected and has diameter dn2 e. Ma and Xu [20]
proved that FQn is node-symmetric and edge-
symmetric. For more results related to folded
hypercubes, the reader can refer to [2,7,18,30,31].

Let V (G) and E(G) be the node set and edge
set, respectively, of a graph G. Two paths P
and Q joining the same nodes x and y are said
to be internally disjoint, denoted by P ||Q, if
V (P ) ∩ V (Q) = {x, y} and E(P ) ∩ E(Q) = ∅.
A spanning tree T in a graph G is a connected
subgraph containing all nodes of G and without
forming a cycle. For x, y ∈ V (T ), the unique
path from x to y is denoted by T [x, y]. Moreover,
if T is a spanning tree with r as its root and a
node x 6= r, then the parent of x is denoted by
parent(T, x). Thus, two spanning trees T and
T ′ with the same root r are ISTs (respectively,
edge-disjoint) if and only if T [x, r] ||T ′[x, r] (re-
spectively, parent(T, x) 6= parent(T ′, x)) for ev-
ery node x ∈ V (T ) \ {r}.
In the following, we describe the concept intro-
duced in [11] for constructing edge-disjoint span-
ning trees of FQn. Since FQn is node-symmetric,
without loss of generality, we may consider node
Parents, all information for calculating the par-
ent of each node x = x3x2x1x0(6= 0) ∈ FQ4
in T3 are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, if
x 6 7, then x3 = 0. In this case, we have
j = 2 and parent(T3, x) = x + 22 = x + 4
for x ∈ {1, 2, 3}; j = 1 and parent(T3, x) =
x + 21 = x + 2 for x ∈ {4, 5}; j = 0 and
parent(T3, x) = x + 20 = x + 1 for x = 6; and
j = ∗ and parent(T3, x) = (24 − 1) − x = 8
for x = 7. On the other hand, if 8 6 x 6 15,
then x3 = 1. In this case, we have j = 3 and
parent(T3, x) = x − 23 = 0 for x = 8; j = 0 and
parent(T3, x) = x − 20 = 8 for x = 9; j = 1 and
parent(T3, x) = x − 21 = x − 2 for x ∈ {10, 11};
j = 2 and parent(T3, x) = x − 22 = x − 4 for
x ∈ {12, 13, 14, 15}. 

3 Proof of the independency
Although Ho [11] has already proved the va-
lidity of the trees by “reachability to the root
through tracing the parent function”, the paths
constructed in the following lemma would facili-
tate our proof of the independency.
Lemma 1. For each i ∈ I ∪ {∗}, Ti constructed
using Gen-Parents is a spanning tree rooted at
0 in FQn.
We now show the independency of the con-
struction. Let P be a path from a node x =
xk−1xk−2 · · ·x0 to 0 and suppose that i, j ∈
I ∪ {∗}. We use P (i, j) to denote the subpath of
P starting from the node with an outgoing edge
labeled by −2i (respectively, +2i or *) and end-
ing to the node with an incoming edge labeled
by −2j (respectively, +2j or *). Moreover, we
write x`|P (i, j) = b, where ` ∈ I and b ∈ {0, 1},
to mean that x` is assigned to b for every node
in the subpath excluding the last node.
Lemma 2. For i, j ∈ I ∪ {∗} with i 6= j, Ti and
Tj are ISTs rooted at 0 in FQn.
According to Lemmas 1 and 2, we have the
following theorem.
Theorem 3. The algorithm of constructing n+1
ISTs of FQn using Procedure Gen-Parents can
be executed in O((n+ 1)N) time, where N = 2n.
In particular, the algorithm can be parallelized on
FQn by using N processor to run in O(n) time.
4 Concluding remarks
In [11], Ho constructed a set of n + 1 span-
ning trees of FQn to serve as a basis of commu-
nication and showed that these spanning trees
are edge-disjoint. In this project, we prove that
the trees constructed are independent. We close
this project with the following discussion about
the heights of ISTs. According to Lemma 1, the
length of the unique path from a node x(6= 0) ∈
FQn with binary string x = xn−1xn−2 · · ·x0 in
each spanning tree can be determined. An easy
observation shows that Ti[x, 0] has length |H1x| if
xi = 1, and |H0x| + 1 otherwise. Thus, all paths
Ti[2n − 1, 0] and T∗[2i, 0] have length n for all
i ∈ I. Therefore, we conclude that the height of
each IST constructed in FQn is twice its diame-
ter and is shallower than one to that of hypercube
constructed in [28].
