scheme is a candidate for mobile application [1]. In 
addition, CDMA using FFT/IFFT technique, with a low 
complexity of hardware implements in the transmitter 
and receive, has been employed in the digital mobile 
broadcasting system [2]. With Offset Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) scheme, OFDM 
modems employing a set of subcarriers to transmit 
information symbols in parallel over the channel 
improve the bandwidth efficiency, it has been proposed 
for the beyond 3G Wireless communication systems [3]. 
Furthermore, it is suitable for the coming application 
required the need of a high data transmission, such as 
Multimedia Mobile Communication Service.  
However, in the wireless communication environments, 
there are many degradation factors in the system. In 
addition to the thermal noise, the fading factor (due to 
the scattering near the transmitter and/or receiver), 
shadowing (due to the obstructions between the 
transmitter and receiver) and multipath effects (due to 
reflections from distant objects) contribute to the hostile 
environment. Besides, due to bandwidth limitation and 
high speed data rate transmission, the Intersymbol 
Interference (ISI) degrades the system performance. 
Moreover, in the CDMA system, most existing 
approaches employ correlators to correlate the received 
signal. Although the correlator technique appears very 
powerful, the Multiple Access Interference (MAI) 
existing in the multiple access channels degrades the 
performance [1]. 
In order to eliminate the above degradation factors, 
some solutions have been proposed. The equalizer 
employs a reliability estimation of the received data 
which is used to adjust the adaptation coefficient of the 
adaptive algorithm has been proposed to reduce the ISI 
effects [4]-[7]. Although the equalizer could be 
employed to reduce the effects of ISI, without the 
precise channel estimation, it might cause a time delay 
[8]. It could not track the time-varying channel. 
Specially, for the sudden changing channel, the 
equalizer is not able to update the rapidly signal 
components and has a slow convergence speed to the 
error equalization.[9] Besides, in the CDMA system, 
MAI makes a serious degradation on the system 
performance. In general, multiuser detection is a 
solution to combat the MAI [10].  
However, the optimal multiuser detector with a high 
degree of complex computing could not be applied for 
practical usage. Among other suboptimal multiuser 
detectors, such as Linear Decorrelating Detectors 
(LDD), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), 
Multistage Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) and 
Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), some have 
the optimal near-far resistance but with the drawbacks 
of noise enhancement and time-delay[11]-[16]. Some 
have a long time delay and the computing efficiency is 
lower than that with the optimal near-far resistance [2]. 
Although PIC detectors could employ the parallel 
computing to improve the efficiency to reduce the 
cancellation error, the traditional PIC could cause 
serious error propagation if there are many users in the 
system [15]. It will reduce the capacity if the PIC is 
applied to the system. Using the fuzzy inference scheme 
to perform the partial parallel interference cancellation 
(PPIC), called fuzzy based partial parallel interference 
cancellation (FB-PPIC), enhances the system capacity 
with avoiding the error cancellation [16]. For the 
Multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA), there are many 
detection schemes have been proposed [17]-[20]. 
However, while the number of user increases, the 
system capacity is obviously reduced because the signal 
propagation characteristics is not considered in PIC, a 
long time computing delay is the main drawback in SIC. 
Applying PPIC with the channel side information might 
help not only to find the appropriate cancellation factors 
to cancel the interference caused by unknown factors, 
also to enhance the system capacity and to approach the

the sum of the i.i.d. random variables can be

Thus, the weight variance of each user keeps the same

If the first-order and second-order statistics of the

probability density functions can be obtained for all 
users. 
Under the assumption of perfect power control, the 
statistics of the adaptation-weight in two different ways 
have been analyze. Followings, the maximum a

V. Conclusion 
An analysis on the statistics of the updating weight of 
the LMS-PPIC scheme is given. Also, the simulation 
results that verify the accuracy of the theoretical 
analysis within a synchronous CDMA system are 
provided. With the appropriate initial weight 
assumption with the perfectly estimated amplitudes, the 
expectations of the adaptation-weights of 
incorrect-decision go toward a negative value. However, 
the expectations of the adaptation-weights of 
correct-decision bits never go toward a negative value. 
Therefore, the binary detection of MAP decision 
criterion is used to determine the minimum error 
detection threshold, and contributes an improvement on 
the performance of the matched-filter.
