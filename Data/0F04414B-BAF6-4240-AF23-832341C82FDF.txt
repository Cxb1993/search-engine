Abstract 
This study aims to examine the gender effect on MVC generation profile, and the trend in 
MVC, HR, and nRMS during a 30-sec sustained exertion. Twenty two male and 22 female 
subjects took part in the experiment. Some conclusions are drawn as follows. 
1. TMVC was 1.916 sec and 1.659 sec for male and female, respectively, and it almost 
took 50% of TMVC from 90% to 100% MVC. 
2. There exists a simple linear regression relationship between force generation and 
time consumed, if the force is not greater than 80% MVC. The rate of force 
generation for male (516.9 N/sec) is as two times as that for female (253.5 N/sec). 
3. During the 30-sec protocol  
I. The relationship between absolute MVC decay and time for both genders is 
linear 
II. Two stages are classified in HR trend. The first, HR increases from the 
beginning to the 15th sec, and maintaining steady HR after that. Male steady 
HR is near 120 beats, and near 96 beats for female.  
III. A decline in nRMS is found for both genders.  
4. There is a high correlations among HR, MVC(N), MVC(%), and nRMS measured  
during a 30-sec protocol of sustained exertion.

2. Methods 
2.1 Subjects 
There were 22 male and 22 female voluntary subjects, who were healthy and free from 
musculoskeletal disorders. Table 1 shows their anthropometric data, and the t-test indicated 
these data were significantly different between genders (p<0.05).

2.2 Materials and apparatus 
The setup was shown in Fig 1. A load cell (SENSOTEC, Model:13/2444-03, 
capacity:100lbs, compression; size: 4×2×3 cm3 (Length× Width× Height)) was designed to 
monitor the force output, it connected with a 12 bit A/D convert card, and it was calibrated its 
linearity with several known weights. Physio Recorder E (Biofeedback 2000, A-2340 
modelling) was applied to record biofeedback, including heart rate (HR) and electromyograph 
(EMG).

(1) Measuring MVC and its corresponding HR and EMG pre to the 30-sec 
maximal elbow exertion, and they were denoted by MVCpre, HRpre, and 
RMSpre, respectively. 
(2) A 2-min rest was given as completing MVCpre measurement. 
(3) Performing a 30-sec protocol of maximal exertion 
i. The posture was the same that applied to measure MVC. 
ii. Subjects were encouraged to exert as forcefully as possible for 30 
seconds. The MVC, HR and EMG were still recorded during this 
duration, and they denoted by MVC30sec, HR30sec and RMS30sec, 
respectively. 
iii. Measuring the MVC and its corresponding HR and EMG at once when 
Step (4) was completed, and they were denoted by MVCpost, HRpost, and 
RMSpost, respectively.

2.4 Experimental design and data acquisition 
A paired t-test was employed to test the shift between pre and post to the 30-sec maximal 
elbow exertion, and the t-test is used to test the gender effect. The significance level is set at 
α=0.05. The responses included were as follows. 
1. The force generation during MVC measurement 
(1). force generation and its corresponding time, and 
(2). The regression model 
2. Fatigue measurement 
(1). The shift in MVC from MVCpre to MVCpost 
i. Absolute: ΔMVC= MVCpost- MVCpre  
ii. Relative: ΔMVC(%)=[MVCpost- MVCpre]/ MVCpre, to eliminate the 
gender effect. 
(2). The change in HR between HRrest and HRpost, denoted by ΔHR= HRpost- HRrest.

3.3.2 The trends in HR 
As to the effect of 30-sec sustained exertion on HR, there seems to be two stages 
classified for both genders, see Fig 8. In the first, HR increases from the beginning to the 15th 
sec, and maintaining steady HR after that. Male steady HR is near 120 beats, and near 96 
beats for female. As to the first stage, there is a good linear fitness between time and HR for 
both genders (R2 >0.95), and males had a greater increase rate than that of females, say 2.69 
beats/sec vs. 1.15 beats/sec, refer to Fig 9. This perhaps results from male having larger MVC 
output, which needs more energy consumption.

3.4 Correlations among responses 
Table 5 shows the correlations among HR, MVC(N), MVC(%), and nRMS. As it can be 
seen, the coefficients are significant and high. During the 30-sec protocol of sustained 
exertion a decrease in MVC was accompanied with a decline in nRMS and an increase in HR.

From above, some conclusions are drawn as follows. 
1. TMVC was 1.916 sec and 1.659 sec for male and female, respectively, and it almost 
took 50% of TMVC from 90% to 100% MVC. 
2. There exists a simple linear regression relationship between force generation and
