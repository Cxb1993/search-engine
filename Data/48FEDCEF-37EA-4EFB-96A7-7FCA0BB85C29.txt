1. 研究目的 
 
Multimedia streaming services have become extremely popular and its use grows 
exponentially in recent years. For applications, such as Youtube and IP-TV, overload the media 
transmission over Internet. To alleviate the congestion problem, Content Delivery Networks 
(CDNs) are often deployed in networks to support large numbers of users. However, this may 
require the deployment of special infrastructure and cost a lot of money. As an alternative, 
peer-to-peer (P2P) networks are introduced to solve the aforementioned problems. Peer-to-peer 
networks make resources, e.g., storages, CPU cycles, and media contents, available at the edges 
of the Internet. Peer-to-peer networks have recently been realized through file sharing 
applications. However, there are still a lot of problems for supporting multimedia streaming over 
peer-to-peer networks. Peer-to-peer networks have not been used effectively for adaptive 
streaming services; users can't access multimedia steaming services at anytime, anywhere with 
different devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants. The lack of an adaptive 
streaming architecture in peer-to-peer networks makes it becomes a critical issue in deploying 
multimedia streaming services over heterogeneous networking environments.  
 
In order to deal with such a problem, Scalable Video Coding (SVC) standard is proposed to 
against the aforementioned deficiencies [1]. The Scalable Video Coding (SVC) standard supports 
the encoding of a video signal at different qualities with different layered bit streams. The 
Scalable Video Coding (SVC) allows for performing on-the-fly rate adjustment of data 
transmission; it also has high video compression efficiency. In order to enable simple bit stream 
adaptation, the substreams in SVC can be easily identified and contained in a complete scalable 
bit stream. A SVC bit stream does not need to provide all types of scalability. In order to provide 
quality and spatial scalability, the SVC usually comes with a loss in coding efficiency relative to 
single-layer coding. The trade-off between coding efficiency and the provided degree of 
scalability can be adjusted according to the needs of applications [2][3][4].  
 
In this project, we propose a peer-to-peer architecture for SVC streaming in heterogeneous 
wireless mobile networking environments. Our proposed peer-to-peer multimedia streaming 
system covers the following concerns: (1) to devise a network adaptation scheme for the 
transmission of shared streaming objects over heterogeneous networking environments, (2) to 
invent a cooperative multimedia audio/video adaptation transmission protocol that can transmit 
multimedia streaming objects according to devices' capabilities using Scalable Video Coding 
(SVC) scheme. By equipping Scalable Video Coding (SVC) for video streaming objects 
employed as for single-layer coding. The redundancy between dependency layers is exploited by 
inter-layer prediction mechanisms. The representations with different spatial resolutions for a 
given time instant form an access unit and have to be transmitted successively in increasing order 
of their corresponding spatial layer identifiers Layer n. Lower layer pictures do not need to be 
present in all access units, which makes it possible to combine temporal and spatial scalability.

3. 1 Network Model 
 
The connectivity structure of every P2P network can be represented by an undirected graph, 
in which nodes of the P2P network form the vertices of the graph and connections between nodes 
are the edges of the graph. Hereafter, the terms graph and network are used interchangeably; the 
terms node and vertex are used equivalently, and so are the terms edges and connections. Let G = 
(V, E) be an undirected graph, where V = { V1, ..., Vn} is the set of nodes and E = { E1, ..., Em} is 
the set of edges in the graph G. A content delivery tree CDTi is a finite set of nodes such that: (i) 
there is a specially designated node called the root which is the source provider of multimedia 
streams; (ii) the remaining nodes are partitioned into disjoint sets, where each of these sets is 
called the subtree of the root.

coded stream and related content deliver nodes for delivering the content. Attributes in the 
content deliver tree table are the substream identifier number, the participant nodes' identifiers 
and node information. At the very beginning (no peer exists yet), the content deliver tree table is 
empty. When a source providing peer joins, the bootstrap peer records its share contents using the 
content sharing table. Assume that we have been provided with a bootstrap peer and contents' 
information. The algorithm for the peer join is depicted as follows.  
 
The bootstrap peer provides resource finding service for participating peers. To join the 
proposed P2P streaming network, a peer u contacts one of the bootstrap peers x with the requiring 
stream identifier Si and the requiring quality parameters Qi, where i >= 0.  The new joining peer 
u contacts the bootstrap peer x for obtaining some setup information, such as the number of 
content deliver trees and the video bit-rate. The bootstrap peer x identifies the request and find the 
most suitable content deliver trees 0

peer x then provides with q subsets of randomly selected peers that participate in each content 
deliver tree l
iCDT .  The randomly selected peers in each content deliver tree 
l
iCDT  can be 
considered as "candidate parents" of the new joining peer u for delivering the SVC coded streams. 
The new joining peer u then requests one or some of these peers to serve as its parent in the 
corresponding content deliver tree l
iCDT . For each content deliver tree 
l
iCDT , the new joining 
peer u sends a packet to each candidate parent for obtaining the candidate parent's current 
computing capability and the network condition, e.g., storage space, the available uplink 
bandwidth, the network distance from the root of content deliver tree l
iCDT to the candidate 
parent in terms of logical hops, and the end-to-end transmission delay from the root of content 
deliver tree l
iCDT  to the candidate parent. The information is used to determine the best peer to 
serve as its parent.  
A peer x is selected as parent in a way to minimize the end-to-end delay time from the stream source 
of content deliver tree 
l
iCDT  to peer u.  For minimizing the end-to-end transmission delay, the round 
trip time (RTT) is employed as a measure of delay and the end-to-end packet deliver time from the stream 
source of content deliver tree 
l
iCDT  through peer x is considered. Firstly, the new joining peer u checks 
whether the peer x has enough available uplink bandwidth for delivering SVC coded stream or not. If the 
peer x does not have enough available uplink bandwidth, peer u checks other randomly selected peers. If 
the peer x has enough available uplink bandwidth, peer u then measures the end-to-end packet deliver time 
from the stream source of content deliver tree 
l
iCDT  through peer x to peer u. The sum of RTT values is 
formulated as , ,src x x uRTT RTT  for all randomly selected peers. After all the RTT values of randomly 
In the proposed scheme, a peer u can have two connections for content retrieval in each 
content deliver tree l
iCDT : primary connection 
l
iPC  and secondary connection 
l
iSC . Initially, 
a primary connection l
iPC  is created for the content delivery in the join phase in each content 
deliver tree l
iCDT . If the current download/network speed of exist primary connection is less 
than a predefined bit rate or quality parameter Qi, a secondary connection  
l
iSC  for improving 
content delivery is created if no such connection is exist. The secondary connection l
iSC  is 
initiated from the swarming phase to the end of stream delivery in each content deliver tree 
l
iCDT . The swarming algorithm monitors network status every Δt second, and then marks each 
connection in each content deliver tree l
iCDT  as primary connection 
l
iPC  or secondary 
connection l
iSC  according to each connection's average download rate and transmission delay. If 
a connection's average download rate and transmission delay is higher than another connection, 
then the connection is marked as primary connection l
iPC . Otherwise, the connection is marked 
as secondary connection l
iSC . It is important to notice that the additional connections among 
peers will place an additional burden on the network links, which increases the probability of 
traffic congestion.  In order to relieve the congestion on the network links, the proposed scheme 
adopts only two connections for content retrieval in each content deliver tree l
iCDT .

base layer substream and the available incoming bandwidth is not enough, the swarming 
algorithm will stop and block the content delivery of its enhancement layers for providing more 
available incoming bandwidth to the base layer substream. The swarming algorithm monitors the 
network status periodically and applied the above mentioned operations every Δt seconds.

In this project, a peer-to-peer architecture for SVC streaming in heterogeneous wireless 
mobile networking environments is proposed. We devise a network swarming adaptation scheme 
to transmit multimedia streaming objects according to devices' capabilities using Scalable Video 
Coding (SVC) over heterogeneous networking environments. By equipping Scalable Video 
Coding (SVC) for video streaming objects according to devices' capabilities, the proposed 
peer-to-peer streaming system can enhance the utilization of media transmission, and can satisfy 
the requirement of adaptive multimedia presentations over heterogeneous networking 
environments.
