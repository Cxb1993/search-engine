to agitate the MAI effect by adaptive 
beamforming. Much research on spatial and 
temporal signal processing using adaptive 
antennas has been pursued in recent years 
[6]-[12]. Obviously combining smart antenna 
with OFDM-CDMA system can improve the 
overall performance of the systems. Smart 
antennas are the new technology that consists 
of antenna elements in an array. Smart 
antennas systems have been used to provide 
significant capacity and quality increases in 
communication systems. Smart antennas are 
the technology that use a fix set of antenna 
elements in an array. The signals from these 
antenna elements are combined to form a 
movable beam pattern that can be steered to 
the direction of desired user. The primary 
advantages of using smart antenna systems in 
broadband wireless networks are to increase 
data throughput and to avoid interference. For 
the multi-rate multiuser MC-CDMA systems, 
several multiuser detectors such as ML 
detector, decorrelating detector and MMSE 
detector have been proposed in [13]. The 
optimal ML multiuser detector has been 
derived for general application but its 
computational complexity is too high to 
implement. Therefore, suboptimal decorre- 
lating detectors have to be found showing 
better performance than that of conventional 
matched filter receiver and having a lower 
computational complexity than that of the ML 
detector. Research of adaptive algorithms for 
deriving optimal antenna weights in the time 
domain, such as LMS, has been proposed 
from a viewpoint of extending techniques of 
an adaptive digital filter. In the proposed 
systems, each antenna adopts an adaptive 
finite-impulse response (FIR) filter, whose 
complexity is fairly low. Certainly, weight 
updated equations of the adaptive antennas 
related to the spreading code vector in 
CDMA-based systems. Recently, weight 
updated equations of the adaptive antennas 
related to the spreading code, namely Wiener 
code filter are proposed in [14]. The filters not 
only have the ability against interference but 
also have the function of despreading. Our 
proposed adaptive receivers utilize the weight 
control mechanism and code adjustments to 
compensate signal distortion in the systems. In 
this paper, we propose and compare three 
multi-rate OFDM-CDMA systems with smart 
antennas. 
2 System Model  
A. OFDM-CDMA systems 
  An OFDM modulator can be implemented 
as an IDFT on a block of information symbols. 
Moreover, the demand for higher data rate 
enables the receiver to use fast signal 
processing transforms such as a FFT for 
OFDM implementation. In OFDM systems, a 
block of data of size Q where Q is a power of 
2 is transmitted as an OFDM symbol. For 
better computing efficiency, it is necessary to 
use the FFT matrix [16] that can be expressed 
by a matrix shown below,

On the uplink transmission, the signals are 
transmitted through channel, the basic smart

code is identical. The relation between the

C. Variable Chip Rate (VCR) Systems 
The VCR OFDM-CDMA multiuser 
communication system, the spreading code at 
the lower chip rate can be regarded as an 
-chip repeating version of the code at the 
higher rate. We must consider frequency 
allocation owing to the different bandwidth 
required by different chip-rate users. The 
spreading codes with the same length are 
represented as follows

D. Multi-code Systems 
In multi-code OFDM-CDMA multiuser 
communication system, multiple data streams 
are sent in parallel to make different data 
symbol have the same length. The number of 
symbol in a serial-to-parallel block depends 
on the parameter Z as introduced under (9). In 
other words, a single rate i user can be viewed 
as Z virtual users with the basic rate [1]. When 
a user needs Z times the basic source rate, it 
converts its signal stream, serial to parallel, 
into Z basic rate streams. (Z≥1) is a variable 
that denotes the source rate a user is 
transmitting. (Z=1) means that the source is 
transmitting at the basic rate [4]. Because the 
signals are spreaded over the same bandwidth 
for transmission in Multi-code systems, the 
processing gain of the spreading code of each 
virtual user is the same as L. The spreading 
code of z-th virtual user in k-th active user at 
and it is difficult to realize the discrepancy in 
the data rate of different users. So we develop 
the new representation of spreading code as

update the weight of the adaptive antenna, 
LMS algorithm is employed for its simplicity. 
We need to compute the gradient of the above 
cost function and then obtain, 
where Γ is PNKV×PNKV diagonal matrix. 
Hence, the diagonal elements of Γ⁻² represent 
the reciprocal of each user's SNR which the 
number of user have the relationship with the 
number of rate and the number of multipath. 
3.2 Post-FFT type Receivers 
A. VPG and VCR Systems:  
This section jointly considers the weight 
update of the adaptive antenna and 
despreading operation for OFDM-CDMA 
communications. Shown in Fig. 1 is the block

4 Simulation Results and conclusion 
This section provides several simulation 
results of the three proposed multi-rate 
OFDM-CDMA systems. The number of users 
in the systems is K=8; multipath fading 
number V=12; the number of antenna array is 
P=8 in all the following simulations. The 
transmitted signal is QPSK throughout the 
simulations. For simplicity, we only consider 
the dual-rate system, that is, 4 high-rate data 
with the symbol rate being twice the basic rate 
of 4 low-rate data. In general, non-orthogonal 
codes are used on the uplink transmission. So, 
we use Gold code and assign one zero into the 
end. For the spreading code, we select the 
processing gain as 32 in high rate users and 64 
in low rate users for multi-rate systems. For 
fair comparison, processing gain 32 is used for 
high rate users of VCR and VPG systems. The 
VCR systems use 32 code length and VPG 
systems use 64 code length for low rate data.   
In Fig. 3, we show the high-rate BER 
performance of the post-FFT multi-rate 
structures. In Fig. 4, we show the low-rate 
BER performance of the post-FFT multi-rate 
structures. In Fig. 3, the high-rate BER 
performance of the post-FFT type in VPG 
systems are better than that of the post-FFT 
type in VCR systems because the spreading 
code characteristic in VPG systems is better 
than that in VCR systems. In high noise 
environment, the VPG systems are better than 
multi-code systems because the VPG systems 
have longer spreading code in low-rate. The 
longer spreading code can achieve better 
performance. In the low noise environment, 
the multi-code systems are better than VPG 
systems because the more weights and 
spreading codes can achieve better 
performance in the low noise environment. In 
Fig. 4, the low-rate BER performance of the 
post-FFT type in VCR systems are better than 
that of the post-FFT type in multi-code 
systems. The low-rate BER performance of 
the post-FFT type in VPG systems are better 
than the post-FFT type in VCR systems 
because the spreading code characteristic in 
VPG systems is better than that in VCR 
systems. In Fig. 5, we show the high-rate BER 
performance of pre-FFT multi-rate structures. 
In Fig. 6, we show the low-rate BER 
performance of pre-FFT multi-rate structures. 
In Fig. 5, the BER performance comparison is 
the same as that in Fig. 3. In Fig. 6, the BER 
performance comparison is the same as that in 
Fig. 4. In Figs. 3-6, the BER performances of 
the pre-FFT type without code adjustment are 
similar to that of the post-FFT type without 
code adjustment and the BER performances of 
the pre-FFT type with code adjustment are 
better than that of the post-FFT type with code 
adjustment. In Fig. 7, we show the high-rate 
BER performances of the proposed pre-FFT 
adaptive receiver with code adjustment, the 
proposed post-FFT adaptive receiver with 
code adjustment and the proposed ML, 
LMMSE and decorrelating multiuser detectors 
in multi-code multi-rate structures. In Fig. 8, 
we show the low-rate BER performances of

The combination of all users’ transmitted signals can be
written as e[w] =
PX
x=1 ex[w], where W is symbol period; Sx
is xth user’s signal power; gx[q] is xth user’s data symbol
in the qth symbol interval; vx[w] is xth user’s spreading
waveform; zx is xth user’s carrier frequency; and X is the
number of users. The carrier phase is denoted as x and
is uniformly distributed over the interval x 5 [0> 2]. The
spreading waveform is given by
vx[w] =
T1X
s=0
vxsWf [w  sWf]> 0  w  W (2)
where vxs is sth chip of the xth user’s spreading code; Wf [w] is
rectangular pulse of duration Wf; and T is length of spreading
code. The xth user’s spreading code can be represented in the
form of a vector as sx = [vx0 vx1 · · · vx(T1)]W . We can use
the spreading waveform defined by (2), whatever, spreading
or despreading operation, just multiplied the corresponding
desired user’s signal. Then, we can obtain the transmitted
signals of the desired user.
The sampling period Wv, which is in turn equal to a fraction
of the chip period Wf. The discrete-time received signal,
sampled at the pth chip output of the received signal, can
be expressed as
u[p] = hm
Ok1X
y=0
kye[p y] + q[p] (3)
where  is unknown constant phase shift in noncoherent case
and perfect known constant phase shift in coherent case; ky is
the coefficients of the channel impulse response; Ok is the
length of channel; and q[p] is zero-mean AWGN channel.
The equalizer output signal t[n] is the estimated nth MPSK
symbol which is the despreading result of the corresponding
received chips pass through the adaptive filter. This will be
described later.
In the next stage of our receiver, the decision variable g[n]
is obtained by noncoherent processing of t[n]. For this, the
reference symbol tuhi [n1] is generated. This might be done
either nonrecursively [5]
tuhi [n  1] =
1
Q  1
Q1X
y=1
t[n  y]
y1Y
x=1
dˆ[n  x] (4)
where Q is the number of adaptive filter output symbols used
for calculation of g[n], or recursively [5]
tuhi [n  1] = (1 )t[n  1] + dˆ[n  1]tuhi [n  2] (5)
where > 0    1, is a forgetting factor. dˆ[·] denotes the
estimated MDPSK symbols. The decision variable g[n] is then
obtained from g[n] = t[n]tuhi [n  1], where (·) denotes
the complex conjugation. For adjustment of the equalizer
coefficients, the LMS algorithm is applied, i.e., the vector of
filter coefficients is tuned to minimize the error variance 2h =

III. THE PROPOSED ADAPTIVE RECEIVERS
The advantages of adaptive single-user receiver are lower
complexity and cost than that of the multiuser receivers. It just
only requires the knowledge for spreading code and timing of
the desired user. We can regard the other unwanted signals
as noise or interference in the communication system. This
paper presents a comparative study of six adaptive single-user
receivers.
A. Q-Tap Linear Adaptive Receiver
The basic form of the T-tap linear adaptive receiver (T-
tap LAR), can be derived from a conventional matched filter
receiver that is implemented as a chip-matched filter followed
by a transversal T-tap filter matched to the spreading code
of the desired user. The equalizer output for nth symbol time
signal t[n] is obtained from
t[n] = wK [n]rf[n] (6)
with the definitions
w[n] = [z1[n] z2[n] · · · zOf[n]]W (7)
rf[n] = [u[T(n  1) + 1+ n0] · · · u[Tn + n0]]W (8)
where (·)W denotes as the transposition and (·)K is Hermitian
transposition. Of is the length of filter weight, n0 is the
decision delay. The initial condition of w[n] is the desired
user’s despreading code, so the length of filter weight Of is
equal to the desired user’s processing gain T. The operation
of this filter can do both equalization and despreading. Each
element in uf[n] is corresponding to the nth symbol generating
chips in the transmitter.
Using g[n] and t[n], the error signal can be rewritten as
h[n] = dˆ[n]t[n]tuhi [n1] = dˆ[n]wK [n]u[n], where u[n] =
rf[n]tuhi [n  1]. For the LMS algorithm, the instantaneous
gradient vector has to be calculated. Then, the adaptive filter
weights are updated according to
w[n + 1] = w[n] + h[n]u[n] (9)
where  is the step size.
B. Cyclically Shifted Filter Bank Linear Adaptive Receiver
The cyclically shifted filter bank linear adaptive receiver
(CSFB-LAR), which consists of two main filters, besides the
chip-matched filter. The front of the two main filters is the
G nonadaptive linear transversal filters, and each nonadaptive
filter is consisted of T elements. The back of the two main
filters is the adaptive filter. The first transversal filter in the
nonadaptive filter bank is the matched filter of the desired
user, and its output is the despreading signal. The other G1
filters are cyclically shifted versions of the matched filter
with successive shifts being spaced by WG. The shift version
filters not only can do the despreading but also match to
the correlation results of the transmitted signal and channel.
We can combine the signals linearly and adaptively, then the
estimated signal t[n] is
t[n] =wK [n]rfg[n] (10)
F. Chip Rate Decision-Feedback Adaptive Receiver
The chip-rate decision-feedback adaptive receiver (CR-
DFAR) is shown in Fig. 2. The CR-DFAR uses both forward
filter and feedback filter. The forward filter was conventional
chip-spaced transversal filter. It uses error signals h[n] and
adaptive algorithm to adapt equalizer weight, and obtains the
better equalizer output signal q1[n]. The feedback filter feeds
back the past data decisions. The decision device introduced in
the feedback path of the filter makes the CR-DFAR a nonlinear
filter.
Now, we can derive equalizer output vector as q1[n] =
wK [n]H[n], where H[n] is defined the same as (18). The
output signal t2[n] was the combination of the forward filter
output vector q1[n] and the despreading code of the desired
user s[n] as t2[n] = q1[n]s[n]. The symbol estimate, de-
noted by t[n], is obtained by subtracting the decision feed-
back interference estimation from the output signal t2[n] as
t[n] = t2[n]  g˜[n], where g˜[n] is the feedback filter output
symbol, defined as g˜[n] = K [n]qi [n]. Note that [n] is the
vector of the feedback filter coefficient sequences, defined as
[n] = [g1g2 · · ·gWi ]W , where Wi is the length of feedback
filter taps, and the vector qi [n] consists of the symbols already
known to the receiver as
qi [n] = [tuhi [n1Wi ]tuhi [n1Wi +1] · · · tuhi [n1]]W
(19)
The time delay signal, tuhi [n  1], is applied to estimate
feedback filter output symbol g˜[n] because it isn’t differential
decoded yet. The last estimation output signal dˆ[n] already
has been differentially decoded, so it can’t be used to estimate
gˆ[n]. The error signal is shown as h[n] = dˆ[n]wK [n]u1[n]+
K [n]u2[n] with the definitions u1[n] =H[n]s[n]tuhi [n  1]
and u2[n] = qi [n]tuhi [n  1]. Finally, the update equations
for the weight vectors of the forward filter and feedback filter
are
w[n + 1] = w[n] + 1h
[n]u1[n] (20)
[n + 1] = [n] 2h
[n]u2[n] (21)
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
In the simulations, two spreading codes are selected: 32
Hadamard codes and 31 Gold codes. The modulated signal
is DQPSK throughout the simulations. The number of users
X is 5 and the step size  is 0=001. In Fig. 3, the learning
curves for the CW-FS-LAR with nonrecursive and recursive
methods are compared. In both figures, the channel model is
h = [0=304 0=903 0=304]. In Fig. 3(a), it can be observed that
the convergence rate of the nonrecursive method decreases
considerably with increasing Q . This might be attributed to
the fact that the reference symbol tuhi [n 1] is less noisy for
the larger Q (the ensemble average effect in (4)). In Fig. 3(b),
the convergence speed of the recursive method also decreases
considerably with increasing . For Q $ 4 and  $ 1,
the performance of the noncoherent receiver approaches that
of the coherent one. Next, we compare the symbol error rate
(SER) performances of the six proposed adaptive receivers.
Because the performance of nonrecursive mode with Q = 10
and recursive mode with  = 0=9 is good enough and close
to that of the coherent demodulation, we choose Q = 10 and
 = 0=9 in most of the following simulations. Two channels
are selected as h1 = [0=304 0=903 0=304] and h2 = [0=6 0=5
0=4  0=3 0=42 0=15 0=005 0=2 0=3 0=35].
Fig. 4 shows the SERs versus the Hv@Q0 with channel
model h1 in both nonrecursive and recursive methods with
32 Hadamard codes. Fig. 4 shows that CHRA-LAR and CR-
DFAR have almost the same SERs. This is because the channel
length is shorter than the length of the equalizer weights, the
decision feedback device in CR-DFAR is with no notable
effect. In Fig. 5, the channel model is h2. The CR-DFAR
performs better than that of the CHRA-LAR because the
channel length is longer than the length of the equalizer
weights. So, the CR-DFAR with finite number of decision
feedback symbols performs better than the CHRA-LAR that
does not use decision feedback symbols scheme. In Figs. 4
to 5, the effects of trading performance for computational
simplicity can be seen in the CSFB-LAR and the DSO-LAR
SER curves. The CW-FS-LAR provides the best SER since it
has some phase compensation capability than the T-tap LAR,
and it is the optimum linear structure for processing complex
cyclostationary signals. Figs. 6 to 7 are the performance
comparisons in the same environments as that in Figs. 4 to
5 beside the spreading code is 31 Gold codes. Obviously,
the trends of the proposed receivers in Figs. 6 to 7 are the
same as that in Figs. 4 to 5. But the SER difference between
each receiver is more noticeable for 31 Gold codes than 32
Hadamard codes. Now, we focus our attention on SER=103.
The SNR requirement of CWFS-LAR is less 0.5dB than
that of CSFB-LAR in Fig. 4(a). However, in Fig. 6(a) the
SNR requirement of CWFS-LAR is less 1.5 dB than that of
CSFB-LAR. In recursive mode, the proposed receivers also
have similar trend as shown in Figs. 4(b) and 6(b). This is
because the Hadamard codes cause less MAI effect than that of
Gold codes. Besides, CW-FS-LAR can compensate for longer
channel effect than CSFB-LAR because the adaptive filter
length of CW-FS-LAR is longer than that of the CSFB-LAR.
For example, the SNR requirement of CWFS-LAR has 1.5 dB
improvement than CSFB-LAR in Fig. 5(a) when SER=103.
This improvement is 1dB better than that in three path channel
environment as shown in Fig. 4(a).
