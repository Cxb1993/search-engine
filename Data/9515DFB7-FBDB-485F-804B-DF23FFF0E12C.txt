Abstract
This paper considers the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for periodically mod-
ulated signals using one uniform linear array of sensors. By means of modulating the sources with
periodic modulation sequences, we can form a series of linear equations relating the autocorrelation
matrices of the received data and the outer products of the scaled steering vectors. Solving these
linear equations yields a group of Hermitian matrices formed from the outer products of the scaled
steering vectors. Then taking eigen-decomposition of these Hermitian matrices, we can obtain all the
scaled steering vectors. By utilizing a special structure of the scaled steering vectors, we can find the
directions of signals impinging on the array. We also examine the relation of the modulation sequences
and the estimation performance, and a design of the modulation sequences to resist the effect of spa-
tial noise is proposed. Simulation results are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
method.

1 Introduction
The subject of array signal processing is concerned with the extraction of information from signals
collected using an array (or arrays) of sensors [1, 2]. One important information is the direction-of-
arrival (DOA) of the incident signals. Take wireless communications for example, the information
of DOA can be used for mobile localization for directional transmission in the down-link [3]. Hence
DOA estimation of sources is one important research topic and various algorithms in this field over
the past decades have been proposed [1]-[6],[10]-[11]. One of the famous algorithms is the MUSIC
(mutiple signal classification) algorithm proposed in [4]. The merit of the algorithm is the accuracy
of estimation can be obtained for large data samples or at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.
Another famous algorithm is the deterministic method developed by A.J. Van Der Veen [5]. Instead

M ×M . A ◦ B is the Hadamard product of matrices A ∈ Cm×n and B ∈ Cm×n [12], and A(:, k)
and A(l, :) are the kth column vector and the lth row vector of A, respectively. For a vector b ∈ Cm,
b(r1 : r2, :) is the subvector formed from the r1th element to the r2th element of b. In addition, for any
m ×m matrix G = [gk,l]0≤k,l≤m−1, we define the operation Γj(G) = [g0,j g1,j+1 · · · gm−1−j,m−1]T ,
for 0 ≤ j ≤ m− 1, i.e., Γj(G) is the vector formed from the jth super-diagonal of G.
2 Problem Statement
Consider a uniform linear array of M sensors where adjacent sensors are separated with equal
distance d. The sensor array receives N narrowband sources from far-field whose directions of arrival
are θ1, θ2, · · · , and θN , respectively. Before transmission, each source si(k), ∀i = 1, 2, · · · , N , is
multiplied by a real and periodic modulation sequence ci(k). Then the standard system model is
shown as follows:
y(k) = Asp(k) +w(k) (2.1)
where y(k) ∈ CM is the received vector at time k. A = [a(θ1) a(θ2) · · · a(θN )] ∈ CM×N is the
array response matrix with the ith column being the steering vector a(θi) = [1 e−jφ(θi) e−j2φ(θi) · · ·
e−j(M−1)φ(θi)]T ∈ CM of source i, where φ(θi) = 2pid sin(θi)λ and λ is the signal wavelength with λ2 ≥ d.
w(k) ∈ CM is the spatial noise vector at time k. sp(k) ∈ CN is the transmitted vector defined as
follows:
sp(k) = [c1(k)s1(k) c2(k)s2(k) · · · cN (k)sN (k)]T = C(k)s(k) (2.2)
where C(k) = diag[c1(k) c2(k) · · · cN (k)] ∈ RN×N and s(k) = [s1(k) s2(k) · · · sN (k)]T ∈ CN .
The purpose of this paper is to develop a method of estimating θi for i = 1, 2, · · · , N , using the
second-order statistics of the received data based on the following assumptions:
(i) The source vector s(k) is a zero-mean, temporally and spatially uncorrelated, and wide-sense sta-
tionary vector with E[|si(k)|2] = d2i . The noise vector w(k) is zero-mean, wide-sense stationary,
and E[w(k1)w(k2)H ] = σ2wδ(k1−k2)IM , where δ(·) is the Kronecker delta function. In addition,
the source signal is uncorrelated with the noise, i.e., E[s(m)w(n)H ] = 0, ∀m,n.
(ii) The DOA θi ∈ [−pi2 , pi2 ], i = 1, 2, · · · , N .
(iii) Each of the modulation sequences ci(k), i = 1, 2, · · · , N , is periodic with period P ≥ N +1, i.e.,
ci(k) = ci(k + P ).
3 DOA Estimation
In this section, we first derive the estimation method when noise is absent. The design of the

where Xi = ZTi ∈ RN×(M−i) , Vi ∈ CP×(M−i), and W ∈ RP×N . From (3.5), it is obvious that each
column of Vi can be written as a linear equation shown as follows:
Vi(:, k) =WXi(:, k), k = 1, 2, · · · ,M − i. (3.6)
Since P > N by assumption (iii), we can appropriately design the modulation sequences {cn(1), cn(2),
· · · , cn(P )}, n = 1, 2, · · · , N , to make the matrix W be full column rank. Then for each i, i =
0, 1, · · · ,M − 1, the least-square solutions of (3.6) are shown as follows:
Xi(:, k) = (WTW)−1WTVi(:, k), k = 1, 2, · · · ,M − i. (3.7)
Then each column of Xi solved by (3.7), is used to form the matrix Xi, ∀i = 0, 1, · · · ,M − 1. Taking
transpose of Xi, we obtain Zi since Zi = XTi , i = 0, 1, · · · ,M − 1. In addition, from (3.4), we know
Zi =

H(1, :) ◦H(1 + i, :)∗
H(2, :) ◦H(2 + i, :)∗
...
H(M − i, :) ◦H(M, :)∗
 . (3.8)
By writing down the elements in Zi with the aid of Hadamard product, we observe that
Zi =
[
Zi(:, 1) Zi(:, 2) · · · Zi(:, N)
]
=
[
Γi(h1hH1 ) Γi(h2h
H
2 ) · · · Γi(hNhHN )
]
, ∀i = 0, 1, · · · ,M − 1.
(3.9)
By collecting the nth column of each Zi, i = 0, 1, · · · ,M − 1, we have
Z0(:, n) = Γ0(hnhHn )
Z1(:, n) = Γ1(hnhHn )
...
...
...
ZM−1(:, n) = ΓM−1(hnhHn )
∀n = 1, 2, · · · , N. (3.10)
Since for each n, hnhHn is a Hermitian matrix, the vectors in (3.10) obtained from (3.7) allow us to form
N rank one Hermitian matrices Qn = hnhHn , which is the outer-product matrix of hn, n = 1, 2, · · · , N .
Then each column vector hn ofH is estimated up to a scalar ambiguity αn by computing the unit-norm
eigenvector associated with the maximal eigenvalue of the matrix Qn, i.e.,
ĥn = hnαn, n = 1, 2, · · · , N. (3.11)
Since hn = a(θn)dn, we have
ĥn = a(θn)dnαn = [1 e−jφ(θn) e−j2φ(θn) · · · e−j(M−1)φ(θn)]Tdnαn, ∀n = 1, 2, · · · , N. (3.12)
Then we divide each scaled steering vector ĥn into two subvectors, namely, ĥn1 = ĥn(1 : M − 1, :)
and ĥn2 = ĥn(2 : M, :). It is clearly that ĥn1 = ĥn2ejφ(θn), and ejφ(θn) can be obtained from the

modulation sequences to minimize ‖q‖2 and the effect of the resulting perturbation term. However
the highly nonlinearity of the modulation sequences contained in q makes it difficult to design. Hence
we adopt another reasonable design criterion which is also used in [9] to tackle this problem.
From (3.18), we know the X̂0(:, k) = X0(:, k) if and only if 1P is orthogonal to every column of
W, i.e.,
WT1P =
[
w1 w2 · · · wN
]T
1P = 0 (3.19)
where wi =
[
ci(1)2 ci(2)2 · · · ci(P )2
]T ∈ RP is the ith column of W, ∀i = 1, 2, · · · , N . If the
modulation sequences can be selected to meet the orthogonality condition (3.19), the effect of noise is
completely eliminated. But this is impossible since the entries of w1, w2, · · · ,wN and 1P are positive.
Therefore we seek to choose the modulation sequences such that 1P is as close to being orthogonal to
wi as possible, for i = 1, 2, · · · , N . To this end, we define the following correlation coefficients
γi =
wTi 1P
‖wi‖2‖1P ‖2 , i = 1, 2, · · · , N, (3.20)
and try to choose the modulation sequences to minimize the correlation coefficient γi subject to the
following two constraints:
1
P
P∑
k=1
ci(k)2 = 1, (3.21)
ci(k)2 ≥ τ > 0, ∀1 ≤ k ≤ P (3.22)
for i = 1, 2 · · · , N . Roughly, constraint (3.21) normalizes the power gain of the modulation sequence
of each source to 1, and constraint (3.22) requires that at each instant, the power gain is no less than
τ . Note that the optimization problem is identical to the case considered in [9], and the resulting
optimal sequences are given by, for any fixed 1 ≤ mi ≤ P ,
ci(k) =

√
P (1− τ) + τ , k = mi
√
τ , k 6= mi, 1 ≤ k ≤ P
(3.23)
for i = 1, 2, · · · , N . In addition, with the optimal solution in (3.23), the corresponding γi is γopt =
1√
P (1−τ)2+τ(2−τ) , ∀i = 1, 2, · · · , N . Note that γopt decreases as τ decreases, and thus the noise effect
imposed on V0 is reduced and hence estimation performance improves. We will give a simulation
example to illustrate this property.
From (3.23), we know each of the N modulation sequences is a two-level sequence with a single
peak in one period. However, to make the matrix W be full column rank such that the least-square
solutions (3.7) can be computed, the peak locations of the N modulation sequences in one period need
to be distinct with each another, i.e., mk 6= ml for all k 6= l. Without loss of generality, we can let
mi = i for i = 1, 2, · · · , N .

n=1(θn − θ̂n)2], where θ̂n is the estimate of θn. The number of Monte Carlo trials is
500. The source symbols are independent and identically distributed binary-phase-shift-keying signals.
The noise is zero-mean and white Gaussian (except Simulation 3).
Simulation 1 – underdetermined DOA estimation
In this simulation, we execute two underdetermined experiments where the number of sensors is less
than the number of sources. There are six signal sources in both experiments with the corresponding
DOA: {θ1, θ2, · · · , θ6} = {−60◦,−45◦,−30◦, 30◦, 45◦, 60◦}. For both experiments, we set d = 0.5λ and
we adopt the modulation sequence ci(k) in (3.23) for source i with period P = 7 and peak location
mi = i, i = 1, 2, · · · , 6. The number of symbol blocks is S = 700. In the first experiment, we set
SNR=10 dB, and the number of sensors is increasing from two to five. Simulation results in Figure
1(a) show that increasing the number of sensors improves the performance of DOA estimation. This
may be due to more information are obtained to average out the computational error and noise effect
for more sensors. In the second experiment, the ULA is only composed of 4 sensors. From Figure
1(b), we observe that the RMSE of angles decreases as SNR increases. In addition, both experiments
also show that the estimation performs better for smaller τ , which is consistent with our analysis in
Section 3.2.
Simulation 2 – comparison with existing methods
In this simulation, we examine the performance of the proposed method with those of the conven-
tional MUSIC algorithm [4] and the deterministic method [5] for two sources. The ULA is composed
of five sensors with d = 0.5λ. For the proposed method, the modulation sequence ci(k) for source i is
chosen as in (3.23) with period P = 3, τ = 0.2, and peak location mi = i, i = 1, 2. The number of sym-
bol blocks is S = 900. We first consider a case of nonclosely spaced sources: {θ1, θ2} = {−15◦, 15◦}.
Simulation results in Figure 2(a) show that the proposed method performs better than both methods
in [4, 5] except the deterministic method for SNR>15 dB. Then, we consider the case of two closely
spaced sources: {θ1, θ2} = {−15◦,−12◦}. Since the MUSIC algorithm fails to resolve the closely spaced
signals under the simulation setting, we only compare the proposed method with the deterministic
method. From Figure 2(b), we observe that the proposed method performs better than the determin-
istic algorithm for this case. It also shows that the capacity of the proposed method to distinguish
two closely spaced sources is good.
Simulation 3 – underdetermined DOA estimation in the presence of colored noise
In this simulation, we examine the performance of the proposed method with that of the KR-
subspace method [6] for the colored noise case. The additive colored noise w(n) is generated by
passing a zero-mean with unit variance white sequence wv(n) through a finite-impulse-response (FIR)
filter c(z) = 1.2 + 0.6z−1 + 0.3z−2 whose output is w(n) = c(z)wv(n). Assume there are four signal
sources with {θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4} = {−60◦,−30◦, 30◦, 60◦}, and the ULA is composed of three sensors with
