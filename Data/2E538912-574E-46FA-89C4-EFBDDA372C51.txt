ABSTRACT 
The crack behavior and spherulitic morphology in melt-crystallized poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) 
were found to be molecular-weight and crystallinity dependent, along with other key factors. 
Multiple types of cracks, i.e., circumferential and/or radial cracks, are massively present in 
low-molecular-weight PLLA (LMw-PLLA-11k), which has high crystallinity. Upon cooling the 
LMw-PLLA from most crystallization temperature, cracks form and crack patterns are dependent on 
the lamellar morphology within the spherulites. Hexagonal, rather than circular, cracks occur 
spontaneously during cooling process of PLLA of a medium-molecular-weight grade (PLLA-120k) 
in PLLA film samples crystallized only at high Tc = 135~138oC and cooled to ambient. However, 
no cracks of any types at all are present in PLLA films of high enough molecular weights 
(PLLA-152 and -258k) upon either slow air-cooling or quench-cooling by dipping the samples into 
liquid nitrogen. Apparently, cooling-induced contraction differences in different directions were 
invalid or not sufficient to address the complex cracking behavior in PLLA. In addition, for 
LMw-PLLA with substantially high crystallinity, cracks are so prone to occur that even cover 
constraint imposes another factor of determining the crack and ring-band patterns. More plausible 
mechanisms and correlations between the cracks, molecular weight, crystallinity, spherulite size, 
and spherulite lamellar patterns of PLLA are analyzed in details and proposed in this study. 
The crystalline structure and crystallization behavior of PLLA crystals in 1:1 (wt%) mixture of 
LMw-PLLA with high-Mw poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) were analyzed using wide-angle X-ray 
diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and small-angle X-ray scattering 
(SAXS). Under cold-crystallization, a unique crystalline orientation of homopolymeric PLLA, 
appearing as a meta-crystal, was discovered in PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend. In PDLA/LMw-PLLA 
blend of nonequal Mw’s, both meta-crystal and '-form crystal in PLLA were found to form when 
crystallized at cold-crystallization temperature (Tcc) of 85-95oC and the -form crystal PLLA 
formed at 100 ≤ Tcc < 120oC, respectively. The SAXS result indicates that the meta-crystal PLLA 
may be incorporated in the stereocomplexed PDLA/LMw-PLLA (sc-PLA) lamellar region. During a 
heating process, the meta-crystal PLLA first partially melts and subsequently it repacks directly 
into the -crystal PLLA without going through the less stable ’-form, by melt-recrystallization 
mechanism. For the PDLA/LMw-PLLA mixtures crystallized at 85oC-95oC, the re-crystallization of 
the meta-crystal becomes more predominant than the melting of the meta-form PLLA crystal. 
Introduction of sc-PLA crystals as small nuclei or large sc-PLA spherulites has great influence 
on patterning the inter-phase boundaries and reducing the cracks in crystallized LMw-PLLA in 
mixtures with PDLA. Unmelted sc-PLA crystals as nuclei induce cracks in later-crystallized 
LMw-PLLA; whereas co-crystallization of LMw-PLLA with PDLA to develop simultaneous 
LMw-PLLA and sc-PLA spherulites is effective in altering the inter-phases for minimizing the 
cracks. Co-crystallization of LMw-PLLA with sc-PLA spherulites tends to be more compact than 
that of PLLA spherulites crystallizing on sc-PLA nuclei. In general, the sc-PLA spherulites 
suppress the occurrence of stressed interphase in LMw-PLLA spherulites and depth of 
cooling-induced cracks is also decreased.

 form of PLLA produced by epitaxial growth on the hexamethylbenzene substrate has been 
reported by Cartier et al.18 More recently, a disordered crystal named as ' form was produced 
when the PLLA samples were crystallized below 120oC, which is different from the  form 
crystallized above 120oC.19-22 Zhang et al.20 have confirmed that the small exothermic peak around 
160oC comes the disorder to order ('- to - form) phase transition. Furthermore, factors 
influencing on formation of polymorphic crystallization and multiple melting behavior of PLLA 
such as thermal treatment,20-26 molecular weight20-26 and blending effects,25,26 have also been 
investigated. The Mw of PLLA do not affect polymorphic crystallization, but the crystallization 
kinetics and crystallization rate may be reduced with the increase of Mw.21 
On the other hand, equimolar mixture of PLLA and PDLA is able to form a stereocomplexed 
PLA (sc-PLA) based on stereoselective interactions,27-29 which is different from homopolymeric 
PLLA or PDLA. For examples, (1) it shows a melting temperature (Tm) of 50oC higher than that of 
PLLA or PDLA,30-34 (2) it crystallizes in a triclinic unit cell with 31 helical conformation,31 and (3) 
it has higher mechanical properties than PLLA or PDLA.35 Formation of sc-PLA is known to be 
produced in mixing solution33,34 or from the melt.32-36 The effects on forming stereocomplexation of 
PDLA and PLLA have been reported, including the Mw of the constituents, mixing ratio, optical 
purities, and crystallization temperature and time.32-38 PLLA and PDLA with a low Mw (Mw < 5×103 
g mol-1) in equimolar blend is favorable for formation of stereocomplex crystallites without 
homo-crystallites of either PLLA or PDLA.33 Stereocomplexed PLA crystallite usually acts as a 
nucleating agent in blends for the enhancement of homopolymeric PLLA crystallization.39,40 
The polymorphic crystallization and thermal behavior of PLLA have been intensively 
investigated.23-26 As reported previously,41 PLLA acts as an amorphous state for the crystallization 
of sc-PLA when the PDLA/PLLA mixtures crystallize above 130oC. Recently, Zhang et al.42 have 
reported that a special mesophase of PLLA in the PLLA-PEG-PLLA copolymer reorganizes 
directly into the stable -phase PLLA without going through the ' phase of PLLA in a heating 
process, and they have reasoned that the mesophase has a more ordering structure than amorphous 
state but is different from the normal crystalline state. However, few studies have been directed to 
the polymorphic crystallization of PLLA by using a spatially-confined crystallization method. This 
kind of crystallization method was discussed extensively for semicrystalline block copolymer 
blends, miscible blends and polymorphic poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) blends.43-46 Some 
crystalline structure of polymorphic polymer are favorable to be formed in confined crystallization. 
For example, -form PVDF is generally obtained from the uniaxial deformation of the -phase at 
ambient temperature.47 In addition, the -form PVDF can also be obtained from nanoscale-confined 
crystals of PVDF in PVDF/PMMA blends by using a spatially-confined crystallization method.46 In 
this study, it would be of interest to investigate what different constrains, other than 
copolymerization with a third polymer, may induce similar phenomenon. Crystallizing of polymers 
from a glassy state is in general different from melt crystallization, as the crystals have to be packed 
from more constrained glassy molecules that tend to restrain large-scale motions for packing into 
order. Thus, it was also great informative to investigate effects of sc-PLA crystallites on crystalline

EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials and sample preparation 
    PLLAs used in this study are of four different molecular weights ranging from a low 11,000 to 
a high 258,000 g mol-1. These PLLAs are code-named as LMw-PLLA (11k) to PLLA-258k, where 
the number-k indicates the values of Mw＇s of PLLA in thousands. Table 1 shows the suppliers and 
basic physical properties of PLLA materials used in this study. Poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) (Mw = 
124,000 g mol-1, Mw/Mn = 1.3, Tg (onset) = 54oC and Tm = 170oC) was purchased from Fluka, Inc. 
(Switzerland). 
PART I Samples of PLLA＇s were prepared by solution-casting using chloroform as solvent 
with concentration of 4 wt% polymer in solvent. A drop of solution of the polymer was deposited 
and uniformly spread on a micro glass slide at 45oC and the solvent was allowed to fully evaporate 
in an atmosphere. A selected sets of film samples of PLLA＇s on the micro glass slide were 
crystallized in conditions of with or without a top cover constraint (micro glass slide), for 
comparison of results. Samples were heated on a hot stage to specific maximum melting 
temperature (Tmax = 190oC) for 2 min for erasing prior crystals, then rapidly removed to another hot 
stage pre-set at a designated isothermal  crystallization temperature (Tc) ranging from 100 to 
140oC. 
PART II The ratio of PDLA/HMw-PLLA or PDLA/LMw-PLLA blends was 50/50, and blend 
sample was obtained from 2 wt% solution in chloroform. The solution was subsequently cast on a 
glass plate at 45oC, and blend films were kept on a hot plate at 50oC for 2 days for the removal of 
any residual solvent. All blend samples were kept at 230oC for 1 min for completely removing prior 
thermal history, and immediately quenched into liquid nitrogen for 3 min and then placed to the 
desired cold-crystallization temperature (Tcc), which designed as cold-crystallized process. After 
fully isothermal crystallization, the blend samples were used for the following analysis. 
PART III Samples of PDLA/LMw-PLLA blends were prepared by solution casting using 
chloroform as solvent with concentration of 4 wt%. The PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend composition was 
kept at 10/90. The non-stoichiometric ratio (10/90) was intended to formation of small amount of 
sc-PLA crystals among the majority PLLA homocrystals. A drop of solution of the polymer 
mixtures was deposited and uniformly spread on a micro glass slide at 45oC and then kept at this 
temperature for one day to evaporate the solvent fully. The dried film on the micro glass slide was 
crystallized without a top cover glass. Samples were heated on a hot stage to a maximum melting 
temperature (Tmax = 190 or 240oC) for 2 min then crystallized at Tc = 125 or 140oC. 
 
Apparatus and procedures 
Morphology characterization and Growth rate measurements. A Nikon Optiphot-2 polarizing 
optical microscope (POM) equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) digital camera and a 
Linkam THMS-600 microscopic heating stage with TP-92 temperature programmer was used to 
observe the crystal morphology of the samples. Samples for POM were solution-coated on glass 
substrate, covered with top glass, and pressed into films of proper thickness (ca. 10~15 microns).

where Q is the so-called scattering invariant. The first maximum position in the 
one-dimensional correlation function can be determined as the long period (L). The first minimum 
position can be either the thickness of crystalline phase (lc) or the thickness of amorphous phase (la) 
depending on the linear crystallinity (clin) of stereocomplexed PLA. The linear crystallinity is 
defined as clin = lc/(lc+la) = lc/L.62 Tsuji et al.63 have proposed that a value of perfect crystalline 
stereocomplexed PLA is 146 J g-1. It is reasonable to assign that the first minimum position as lc 
when the linear crystallinity is smaller than 0.5 (a value of clin is 0.47 for PDLA/LMw-PLLA 
sample cold-crystallized at 130oC for 9h).

crystallization and cooling in these high-molecular-weight PLLAs. Obviously, cracks are more 
prone to form in low-molecular-weight than in high-molecular-weight PLLAs. Interestingly, the 
trend of crack behavior is opposite with the formation of ring-banded spherulites, as the behavior of 
ring-band spherulites easier to form in high-molecular-weight of PLLA＇s than in 
low-molecular-weight ones. 
Figure 3 shows the crack patterns in ring-banded spherulites of PLLA from melt-crystallized 
at Tc = 130oC with a top cover. Interestingly, with increasing molecular weight, the size of 
spherulites and band spacing of ring-banded spherulites decrease. The crack patterns are also 
different when the molecular weight of PLLA is different. For LMw-PLLA, there are numerous 
types of cracks: (1) tiny tri-branched cracks near center of spherulites, (2) twin-circumferential 
cracks coinciding with the dark bands in spherulites, and (3) radial short-segmental voids 
coinciding with the bright bands in spherulites as shown in Figure 3(e). For LMw-PLLA crystallized 
at 120oC, the crack pattern is circular and smooth circumferential cracks; however, cracks become 
irregular when the morphology is of a pattern of dendritic spherulites (Tc = 130oC).11 As discussed 
earlier, the cracks in PLLA-120k do not occur spontaneously during cooling process. Figure 3(f) 
shows the circumferential cracks in PLLA-120k, which occur during cooling process and graph 
taken at ambient temperature after holding at this temperature for 9 h. For PLLA-152k and 
PLLA-258k, only a few interspherulitic cracks occur during crystallization process but no 
additional cracks of other types occur further during cooling from Tc to ambient temperature. The 
interspherulitic cracks shown in Figure 3(g,h) are similar with the cracks in poly(hydroxybutyrate) 
(PHB), which reportedly are caused by a significant negative pressure due to the volume change on 
crystallization.7 The fact that there is considerable stress in the samples caused by the volume 
reduction on crystallization can be evidenced by the appearance of voids/bubbles near the growth 
front.   
Cracks not only occur in the ring-banded spherulites but also in ringless spherulites of 
PLLA＇s upon cooling from Tc to ambient; however, the crack patterns differ depending on the 
lamellar patterns (ringless vs. ring-banded) on the spherulites set up at Tc. Among the four Mw 
grades of PLLA＇s used in this study, only ringless spherulites of LMw-PLLA and PLLA-120k 
show cracks during cooling process as shown and discussed earlier in Figure 2. The cracks were 
also examined and compared in the ringless spherulites of PLLAs of various Mws. Figure 4 shows 
crack patterns in ringless spherulites of PLLA-120k melt-crystallized at Tc = 135oC without top 
cover. The crack pattern of PLLA-120k crystallized either with or without a top cover at 135oC is 
of a hexagonal geometry, in which the cracks occur simultaneously upon cooling process.  
Apparently, for PLLA-120k, the cracks occur simultaneously when the samples are crystallized at 
higher Tc (135-138oC). A similar hexagonal crack pattern in PLLA has been reported by He, et al.,9 
who suggest that the hexagonal-shape cracks might results from the (110) growth plane as 
hexagonal-shaped crystals are formed at the early stage of melt crystallization at 135oC. It must be 
note here that cracks of different geometry, such as circular geometry, are also possible for PLLA 
crystallized at other Tcs.

of cracks. Additionally, for a fully Tc-crystallized sample quenched to -150oC using liquid nitrogen, 
the thermal shrinkage obviously will be much larger than that by cooling the same sample from Tc 
to ambient. However, no cracks, but only concentric wrinkles, appear in films of high-Mw 
PLLA-152k quenched into liquid nitrogen. This result indicates that thermal shrinkage is not the 
only factor and may not be the main factor influencing formation of cracks in PLLA. Crystalline 
characteristics in PLLA and crystal packing patterns constitute some of the main factors accounting 
for cracks. 
In the earlier discussion, cracks are more prone to occur in LMw-PLLA as shown earlier in 
Figure 2. Also as shown earlier in Figure 3, the crack patterns are different in different molecular 
weights of PLLA when crystallized at the same Tc = 130oC. Apparently, the molecular weight in 
PLLA is highly influential on the tendency of formation of cracks. As cracks are related to crystals 
in PLLA, it would be intuitive to suggest that the molecular weights in PLLA might be related to 
the crystallinity levels in PLLA＇s. The crystallinity of all Mw grades of PLLA used in this study 
was measured using DSC to reveal whether the crystallinity might be a factor on the formation of 
cracks. From the DSC curves shown in Figure 8, the melting endothermic enthalpy decreases with 
increasing molecular weight of PLLA. The crystallinity of PLLA can be calculated by using 
equation: Xc = Hm/Hmo × 100%,64 where Xc is degree of crystallinity; Hm is the melting 
endothermic enthalpy; and Hmo is the melting endothermic enthalpy of perfect crystals. Various 
values of Hmo for perfect crystals in PLLA have been reported, ranging from 91 to 148 J g-1.65-69 A 
value of 91 J g-1 reported by Wunderlich66 was used to estimate the degrees of Xc of PLLAs used in 
this study. 
The calculated values of Xc in Table 2 show that the degree of crystallinity proportionally 
decreases with increase of molecular weights of PLLAs, which on average ranges from 73.3% for 
the lowest-Mw PLLA to 47.3% for the highest-Mw PLLA. Apparently, the level of Mw of PLLA 
influences the tendency of crystallization and thus its maximum crystallinity. In turn, the 
crystallinity in PLLA has determining effects on the formation of cracks. Cracks are more prone to 
occur in the samples with a high crystallinity (or low molecular weight, such as LMw-PLLA), but 
cracks are rare or entirely absent in PLLAs of a low crystallinity (or high molecular weights, such 
as PLLA-152k and 258k). In addition, it is known that fully amorphous poly(D, L-lactic acid) 
(PDLLA) does not form cracks at all when heated and then cooled. 
For further clarifying the effects of Mw or crystallinity on the formation or patterns of cracks, 
blends of LMw-PLLA with each of the three different Mws of PLLAs (PLLA-120k, -152k, -258k), 
respectively were prepared at a fix 50/50 composition, and were characterized for correlating the 
cracks and sperhulite morphology. Figure 9 shows the spherulitic morphology and crack pattern of 
LMw-PLLA/PLLA-120k, LMw-PLLA/PLLA-152k, and LMw-PLLA/PLLA-258k (50/50) blends  
melt-crystallized at Tc = 130oC with a top cover (constrained). As shown earlier in Figure 3, when 
crystallized at Tc = 130oC, the sample films of PLLAs of various Mws show ring-banded spherulites 
in which the band spacing of ring-banded spherulites decreases with increasing Mw. However, the 
morphology of PLLA blends [(LMw-PLLA/PLLA-120k), (LMw-PLLA/PLLA-152k), and 
  12
lamellar patterns in spherulites of PLLA as discussed above. 
 
PART II A unique meta-form structure in stereocomplex of poly(D-lactic acid) with 
low-molecular-weight poly(L-lactic acid) 
 
Figure 12 shows WAXD profiles of complexes composed of 1:1 mixtures of PDLA blend 
with two different Mw’s PLLA (11k and 152k) cold-crystallized at 100oC. The diffraction peaks at 
2 = 11.5o, 20.5o, and 23.5o, are known to be attributed to the sc-crystal form with a triclinic unit 
cell of dimension: a = b = 0.916 nm, c = 0.87 nm, and  =  = 109.2o, = 109.8o.27,31 Only 
characteristic complex crystal peaks are seen and there are no other peaks, indicating that both 
PDLA and PLLA-152k are stereo-complexed into an sc-crystal form with equi-molar ratio (1:1).  
For the complex crystal formed by PDLA with LMw-PLLA (11k) (Figure 12(b)), in addition to the 
characteristic sc-crystal peaks (11.5o, 20.5o, and 23.5o), additional diffraction peaks at 2 = 16.1o 
and 18.4o are observed, indicating that other crystal types are present. These peaks for the 
additional crystals are in agreement with the ' crystal form of either PLLA (or PDLA) crystals.19,20 
This result reveals that not all PDLA and PLLA chains are transformed into sc-form crystallites in 
the 1:1 (wt%) mixtures of PDLA with LMw-PLLA. These additional X-ray diffraction peaks may 
be attributed to '-crystals induced by nonequimolar effects by mixing a high-Mw PDLA with 
low-Mw grade of PLLA, which can be made more likely in cold-crystallization from a rigid glassy 
state with little chain mobility.   
The crystalline structures of homopolymeric PLLA are strongly affected by the crystallization 
temperature upon cold- or melt-crystallization.20-26 Cold-crystallization from a glassy state at 
temperature above 110oC was imposed on the complex mixtures of PDLA/LMw-PLLA and neat 
PDLA samples, and WAXD was performed to analyze their crystal forms. Figure 13 shows WAXD 
profiles of (A) neat PDLA and (B) complex crystals of PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend, both having been 
cold-crystallized at Tcc = 120-130oC. For the neat PDLA samples, Figure 13-(A) shows the 
diffraction peaks located at 2 = 12.1o, 16.3o, 18.6o, 22.0o, corresponding to the  form of 
PDLA.19,20 Note that neat PDLA samples melt at even high temperature ~230oC for 1 min, the 
crystalline structures are similar with the results of the previous literatures which melt at a lower 
temperature,70,71 indicating that thermal degradation is not affected the crystalline structures in 
either neat PDLA or blends system. The other neat PLLA blend reveals the similar phenomena with 
neat PDLA system, but it is not shown for brevity. As previously reported,19-22 '- and -crystal of 
neat PLLA are formed at Tc < 120oC and Tc ≥ 120oC, respectively. By comparison, for the 
PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend sample in Figure 13-(B), only three peaks for the sc-crystal forms are 
observed in samples cold-crystallized at 120oC or 130oC. This indicates that the crystals of PLLA 
caused by the nonequimolar effects in PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend cannot be developed when the 
blends cold-crystallized above 110oC. 
 Samples were subjected to an even lower range of cold-crystallization below 110oC down to 
80oC, and they were similarly characterized.  Figure 14 shows WAXD profiles for neat PDLA 
  14
Note that it disappears completely at 133oC, at which temperature the meta-crystal peak (16.6o) is 
still present. The fact indicates that the meta-crystal may transform into -crystal in 
85oC-crsytallized sample with post heating to 139oC or above. The'-crystal may also contribute to 
transform into the -crystal, but at slightly lower temperature of 133oC. 
To summarize, the intensity changes of '- and meta-crystal forms of homopolymeric PLLA 
and the appearance of a -crystal PLLA are influenced by increases of temperature. Relative 
intensities of ' (or - and meta-crystal homopolymeric PLLA were calculated on the basis of the 
ratio of the intensity/the maximum intensity (I/Imax) at the fixed diffraction peaks (16.0, 16.2, and 
16.6o), and the strongest intensity of diffraction peak located at 11.5o is chosen as the maximum 
intensity for normalization. Figure 17 shows plots of I/Imax of '-/-crystal and meta-crystal of 
PLLA in 85oC-crystallized blend by stepwise heating from 125 to 160oC. As shown in Figure 17, 
the intensities changes of '-/-crystal and meta-crystal of PLLA can be classified into three 
regions: I, II, and III. In the region I, the intensity of meta-crystal PLLA (marked as solid-triangle 
symbols) decreases remarkably, indicating that the main meta-crystal PLLA melts at the lower 
temperature. Besides, both intensities of '- and -crystal PLLA (marked as solid-cross and 
solid-rhombus symbols, respectively) slightly decrease with increasing temperature in the region I. 
This change can be interpreted that the minor amounts of '- and -crystal PLLA also melt in the 
region I region. With increasing temperature, the intensity of '-crystal PLLA almost decreases into 
amorphous state in the region II and III, indicating that the orientation of '-form PLLA chains is 
kept unchanged during the region II and III. Note that the relative intensity of meta-crystal PLLA 
decreases drastically but that of -crystal PLLA increases in the region II. These facts reveal that 
the -crystal PLLA are transformed from the molten chains of meta-form PLLA by 
melt/recrystallization rather than transforming from the meta-crystal to '-form crystal and then a 
solid-solid transformation from ’-form to -form. After complete formation of the -form PLLA 
crystals, the -crystal PLLA starts to melt with the increase of temperature in the region III. 
To probe the formation of crystalline structures of meta-crystal PLLA in 85oC-crystallized 
PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend, temperature-dependent small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) on blends 
were analyzed. Figure 18 shows temperature-dependent Lorentz-corrected SAXS intensity profiles 
of 85oC-crystallized PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend at a heating rate of 3 oC min-1. Before melting, a 
three-phase system comprised of the predominant phase of stereocomplexed PDLA/LMw-PLLA 
crystals, the mixed crystalline phase of PLLA crystals (meta- and '-/-form and the amorphous 
phase is created. One SAXS peak at q = 0.52 nm-1 caused by the regular lamellar structure of 
sc-crystal is observed. The peak at q = 0.52 nm-1 slightly shifts to lower values with the increase of 
temperature, suggesting enhancement of the lamellar thickness in the sc-crystal structures upon the 
heating process. The increase of SAXS intensity with increasing temperature is due to the increase 
of density difference between the crystalline phase and amorphous phase. The values of the long 
period (L) and the thickness of crystalline phase (lc) in 85oC-crystallized PDLA/LMw-PLLA (50/50) 
blend were further calculated using the one-dimensional correlation function  (z).60,61 
Figure 19 shows plots of (A) DSC curve and (B) the corresponding values of L, la, lc for 
  16
are observed, confirming that the re-crystallization of homopolymeric PLLA phase transition 
(molten meta-form PLLA to -form PLLA) becomes a more predominant process when 
cold-crystallized from 85oC to 95oC. 
As previously reported,19-22 the phase transition of -form PLLA in the heating process is 
beginning from the disordered '-form PLLA. In this study, a similarly unusual, yet different, 
meta-form PLLA crystals were found to form in PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend, which has the less 
ordered structure in comparison with the '- (or -) phase PLLA. Besides, the melting temperature 
of the meta-crystal PLLA phase in PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend (Tm~140oC) is higher than that of the 
mesophase reportedly existing in the PLLA-PEG-PLLA copolymer system (Tm~86oC).42 The fact 
indicates that the meta-crystal PLLA in the PDLA/LMw-PLLA homopolymer mixtures has a better 
order than the mesophase PLLA in PLLA-PEG-PLLA copolymer. This may be so because the 
meta-crystal PLLA is in a homopolymer PDLA/LMw-PLLA mixture in contrast to the mesophase 
crystal in a tercopolymer, which imposes more severe constraints in crystal packing. The 
meta-PLLA crystal in the PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend is different from the mesophase PLLA in 
PLLA-PEG-PLLA copolymer.42 
 
PART III Effects of stereocomplex nuclei or spherulites on crystalline morphology and crack 
behavior of poly(L-lactic acid) 
 
Solution-cast as-crystallized blend composition of PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) was found to 
pack into small amount of sc-PLA crystals embedded among mostly PLLA homocrystals. 
Subsequent melting and then melt crystallization of these solution-cast blend samples was 
performed. Heating at Tmax (190 and 240oC) prior to crystallization would determine if or not the 
crystallization of the blend was in presence of prior sc-PLA spherulites. Spherulitic morphology of 
PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) samples melt-crystallized at different Tc by quenching from various 
Tmax is shown in Figure 21. Figure 21(A) and (B) shows the POM morphology of 
PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend at Tc equal to 125 and 140oC, respectively, for Tmax = 190oC. Small size of 
ring-banded spherulites and tiny crystals are the morphology of PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend at 
Tc=125oC. As shown in the inset graph of Figure 21(A), LMw-PLLA only crystallizes into one or 
two bands. However, at a higher Tc (140oC), the morphology of blend system is dendritic 
spherulites, instead of ring-banded spherulites. As reported by Ikada et al.,72 the melting 
temperature of sc-PLA is higher than that of either LMw-PLLA or PDLA, about 220-230oC. Thus, 
with Tmax = 190oC only LMw-PLLA or PDLA nuclei can be erased, and sc-PLA nuclei unmelted. 
Obviously, the morphology shown in Figure 21(A) and (B) consists of LMw-PLLA spherulites and 
sc-PLA nuclei. By contrast, with further increase of Tmax higher than the melting temperature of 
sc-PLA, i.e., Tmax = 240oC, all sc-PLA nuclei can be erased. The morphology of PDLA/LMw-PLLA 
blend system with this Tmax is shown in Figure 21(C) and (D) for Tc = 125 and 140oC, respectively. 
There are two types of spherulites at Tc = 125oC, dendritic spherulites with strong birefringence and 
ringless spherulites with weak birefringence. Dendritic and ringles spherulites belong to 
  18
blend, and the melting and crystal cell results are shown in Figure 24 ((A), (B), respectively). DSC 
thermograms (Figure 24(A)) show that as this blend is crystallized at 140 oC by quenching from 
Tmax = 240oC, characteristic melting peaks of LMw-PLLA and sc-PLA crystals can be observed 
clearly. This fact means that there are not only sc-PLA but also LMw-PLLA crystals when the 
PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) blend is crystallized at 140oC. The WAXD pattern of curve-b in Figure 
24(B) also shows evidence that both LMw-PLLA and sc-PLA can be crystallized at Tc = 140 oC by 
quenching from Tmax = 240oC. The appearance of diffraction peaks for the (010), (110)/(200), (203), 
and (015) planes indicates that LMw-PLLA crystallizes in the -form crystal cell.20 Crystal of 
sc-PLLA complex is indicated by the diffraction peaks of (110), (300)/(030), and (220) planes.50 
However, it must be expounded why only sc-PLA spherulites can be observed (earlier in 
Figure 21(D)) and whether there are spherulites of LMw-PLLA crystal in the crystallized blends. To 
answer these questions, POM morphology graphs for fully crystallized blend samples heated to 
higher temperatures with heating rate = 2 oC min-1 are shown in Figure 25. When a fully 
crystallized sample is heated up to 180oC, the LMw-PLLA spherulites melt but the sc-PLA 
spherulites remain at this temperature. With further heating up to 230oC, the LMw-PLLA crystals 
completely melt and the birefringence of spherulites becomes weak and turns to be same as the 
birefringence of sc-PLA spherulites at Tc = 125oC. Apparently, the LMw-PLLA spherulites enhance 
the birefringence of the sc-PLA spherulites. The spherulite pattern at Tc = 140oC and at T = 230oC 
is the same, showing that the spherulites at this Tc are sc-PLA spherulites. PLLA spherulites are 
trapped in sc-PLA spherulites, and this fact is the possible reason why only ringless spherulites of 
sc-PLA can be observed at Tc = 140oC. With increasing Tc, the size of the sc-PLA spherulites 
increases and the size of sc-PLA at Tc = 140 oC is approximately three times larger than that formed 
at Tc = 125oC. 
 Furthermore, melt crystallization of the solution-cast PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) blend was 
conducted by quenching from low or high Tmax (190-240oC), at which LMw-PLLA or both 
LMw-PLLA and sc-PLA crystals in blends would be erased, respectively. When all fully 
crystallized samples were cooled to ambient, it was found that only spherulites in the sample of 
Figure 21(B) (i.e., solution-crystallized PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) further subjected to Tc = 140oC 
by quenching from Tmax = 190oC, which contains unmelted sc-PLA small-size crystals.) show 
cracks. More detailed analysis was performed to understand why only this sample resulted in 
cracks but others did not. Figure 26 shows spherulitic morphology of PDLA/LMw-PLLA blend at 
ambient temperature for different thermal treatments in order to obtain the samples where 
LMw-PLLA crystallize either in the presence of sc-PLA nuclei or spherulites. Left and right 
columns show POM and OM micrographs, respectively. Right column shows corresponding OM 
graphs for revealing cracks. Figure 26(A) is POM and OM micrographs for PDLA/LMw-PLLA 
(10/90) melt-crystallized at 140oC by quenching from Tmax=190oC. Thermal schemes are as 
following. First, the sample was melted at 240oC then crystallized at 140oC to let PLLA and sc-PLA 
crystallize and cooled to ambient temperature after being fully crystallized. Then, the sample was 
heated and melted at Tmax=190oC, at which the sc-PLA spherulites remained intact but PLLA 
  20
diameter. These tiny nano-size crystals were beyond optical resolution and not visible in OM or 
POM graphs, but are clearly revealed in AFM phase images. 
Figure 28 shows AFM images of PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) blend isothermally crystallized at 
140oC by quenching from Tmax = 240oC and after fully crystallized the sample is cooled to ambient 
then remelted at Tmax = 190oC and recrystallized Tc = 140oC. Figure 28(A) shows evidence that the 
LMw-PLLA spherulites overlap with sc-PLA spherulites, where the dashed line shows the boundary 
between the LMw-PLLA and sc-PLA spherulites and the impingement between two sc-PLA 
spherulites are shown by a black arrow. The thickness of LMw-PLLA spherulites is about 200~400 
nm above the sc-PLA spherulites. Figure 28(B) is zoomed-in area of Figure 28(A) showing the 
boundary between sc-PLA spherulites and LMw-PLLA spherulites overlapped with sc-PLA 
spherulites which can be distinguished from the lamellar patterns. Figure 28(C) and (D) shows the 
detailed lamellar patterns of the sc-PLA spherulites in comparison with LMw-PLLA spherulites 
overlapped with sc-PLA spherulites, respectively. Both phase images in Figure 28(C) and (D) 
shows a flat-on lamellar pattern. However, there are numerous pultruded crystalline rod-like dots of 
a few nanometers (diameter = 20~50 nm) for the sc-PLA spherulites (Figure 28(C)), and some of 
them appear on the surface of LMw-PLLA spherulites, as indicated by arrow in Figure 28(D). 
However, none of such rod-like structures are seen in the homo-crystals of LMw-PLLA that 
crystallized in the presence of sc-PLA nuclei (shown earlier in Figure 27(C)). The nano rod-like 
crystals in Figure 28(C) are an indication of formation and presence of sc-PLA spherulites in the 
crystallized PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) blend. The lamellar pattern of LMw-PLLA spherulites in the 
presence of either sc-PLA nuclei or spherulites is flat-on. However, lamellar arrangement in the 
presence of sc-PLA spherulites is more compact or denser than that in the presence of sc-PLA 
nuclei. Apparently, this arrangement influences the formation of cracks in LMw-PLLA spherulites. 
In summary, cracks are less prone to occur in the more compact or denser spherulites and sc-PLA 
reduces and hinders formation of cracks in LMw-PLLA spherulites. 
  22
was examined using an 85oC-crystallized blend sample during a heating process. With increasing 
temperature, the meta-crystal LMw-PLLA crystal (P1) first melts partially at a lower temperature 
(~140oC). With further increase of temperature from 142oC to 150oC, two phase transitions of the 
meta-crystal LMw-PLLA in blends are possible: (1) one is continuous melting of the meta-form 
LMw-PLLA crystals, and (2) the molten meta-form LMw-PLLA crystal then repacking directly into 
the -form crystal LMw-PLLA, without going through the less stable ＇-form, by 
melting-recrystallization mechanism. For the PDLA/LMw-PLLA mixtures crystallized at Tcc from 
85oC to 95oC, the re-crystallization of the P1 peak (meta-form crystal) becomes more predominant 
than the melting of the meta-form LMw-PLLA crystal. Finally, the repacked -form LMw-PLLA 
crystal melts at higher temperature (~152oC). These facts provide interesting and useful clues that 
the -form crystal LMw-PLLA can be repacked from the molten meta-form crystal LMw-PLLA 
chains by melt-recrystallization rather than transforming from the meta-form crystal to '-form 
crystal and then a solid-solid transformation from '-form to -form. 
Small amount of sc-PLA crystals is present in mostly LMw-PLLA homocrystals as a 
non-stoichiometric PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) blend is solution cast. Subsequent melt 
crystallization of the solution-cast PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) blend by quenching from either low 
or high Tmax (190 or 240oC) would determine if LMw-PLLA or both LMw-PLLA and sc-PLA 
crystals in blends would be erased. The nano rod-like crystals on the top surface sc-PLA spherulites, 
if present, would profoundly influence the crystallization and crack behavior of LMw-PLLA. 
Generally, cracks in LMw-PLLA are known to exist after crystallization and cooling. Crystallization 
by quenching from Tmax = 240oC, sc-PLA spherulites and homocrystals of PLLA are crystallized 
simultaneously from PDLA/LMw-PLLA melts, there are no cracks, or cracks are much less prone to 
occur, after crystallization at Tc and subsequent cooling. On the other hand, if LMw-PLLA crystals 
are melted but sc-PLA crystals are not (at Tmax = 190oC), subsequent holding of the 
PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) blend at Tc results in the LMw-PLLA component crystallizes on the 
presence of sc-PLA nuclei and cracks occur during cooling. Not only short-radial cracks but also 
wrinkles can be observed in the latter case.  
 Lamellar arrangement of LMw-PLLA in presence of sc-PLA crystalline spherulites is 
more compact than that of LMw-PLLA in presence of sc-PLA nuclei. Apparently, formation of 
cracks and patterns is affected by the lamellar assembly in presence of complexes as templates. The 
number and depth of cracks of LMw-PLLA in PDLA/LMw-PLLA (10/90) blend is fewer and shorter 
than that of neat LMw-PLLA. In summary, cracks are less prone to occur in the more compact 
spherulites and the sc-PLA crystal reduces and hinders the formation of cracks in LMw-PLLA (or 
PDLA) spherulites.

Invitation Letter from Organizer 
Dear Prof. Eamor M Woo  
  
The 6th International Symposium on High-Tech Polymer Materials (HTPM-VI) will be held in Xiamen, China during 
November 7 to 11, 2010. This is an international conference that will draw participants from Asia, Europe, North 
America, South America as well as Australia etc. Please consult the attached files which are the first circular of the 
conference. You may also check the web site below for up-to-date information for this meeting.

segmental rod-like lamellae. These co-focal spheres spray in interiors of bulk and 
reach the top surface to assume a pattern of concentric rings as those typically seen in 
thin films cast on glass slides. Apparently, these two types of ring-banded spherulites 
are originated from different nucleating mechanisms. Apart from the difference in the 
inter-ring spacing, these two ring-banded spherulite types also differ significantly in 
internal patterns. Effects of surfaces on spherulites and ring band types are obvious. 
From these analyses on the ring bands in the interiors of bulk-form PNT crystallized 
at several specific temperatures, it can be proposed that the growth of spherulites in 
three dimensions is layer by layer, packing into a multi-shells structure in the 
ring-banded spheres.
