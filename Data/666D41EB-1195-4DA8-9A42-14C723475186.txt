Abstract 
In the study, we are going to develop a tri-layer membrane 
as the artificial skin for extensive burn injury. The first layer is 
a sponge of gelatin with 70% in porosity and 20-100 µm in 
pore size. The second layer is as so called auto-stripped layer 
composed by poly-N-isopropyacrylamide (PNIPAAm). The 
layer will be automatically peeled off from the tri-copolymer 
layer once the wound site closed and recovered. The third layer 
is composed by polypropylene (PP) non-woven fabric, which 
provides an open structure for exudates drainage out and 
reduces the risk of second infection. From the results of MTT, 
IL-8, IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α measurement, the developed 
material will not induce the tissue inflammatory or immune 
response. SEM studies revealed the dermal fibroblasts made 
initial contact with the material surface through the radial 
extension of filopodia followed by cytoplasmic webbing. 
Finally, dermal fibroblasts flattened and go for further 
proliferation and extra-cellular matrix secretion. In addition, 
this dressing can be completely biodegradable 4 weeks 
post-operation. 
 
Introduction 
To reduce the extent and duration of open wound, the use 
of cadaver skin allograft and porcine xeno-graft in moderate 
and large injures as temporary transplantation have been 
developed. The problem inherent in all these transplantation 
approaches is ultimate graft rejection following the withdrawal 
of intentional immuno-suppression [1-3]. Although there has 
long been a recognized need for, and work on, a 
physiologically acceptable skin replacement, the actual 
development of artificial skin has occurred only recently as a 
result of concomitant advances in the understanding of skin 
structure, wound healing, and polymer engineering. 
In the study, we are going to develop a tri-layer wound 
dressing as the artificial skin for extensive burn injury. [4-8]. It 
would provide a nonantigenic membrane closely resembling 
dermis in its anatomic structure and chemical composition, 
which would act as biodegradable scaffold inducing the 
synthesis of a “neodermis”. The following describes the 
preparation, biocompatibility, and preliminary results of animal 
study of the artificial skin. 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
2-1Preparation of tri-layer wound dressing 
PP nonwoven was combined with PNIPAAm hydrogel by 
plasma and UV-graft polymerization process (the apparatus 
was shown in Fig. 1). Then immobilized with gelatin by the aid 
of GA agent. The complete tri-layer morphology was observed 
using scanning electron microscope. 
2-2 Preparation of Cell population 
Fibroblast cells were grown using MCDB 110 (Sigma 
modified for use in a 5% O2 incubator by the addition of 50 
mM Na2CO3, pH 7.1) and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine 
serum.  
2-3 Preparation for Cytokine Assay 
Human dermal fibroblasts were seeded (5×104 cells per 
well) in 24-well tissue culture plates in 2 ml ITS* solution 
(Insulin-Transferrin-sodium selenite) respectively. After 
growing for 1, 3, 7 days, the culture medium was collected and 
used for assays of IL-8, IL-1α, IL-6 and TNF-α. 
2-4 MTT Assay 
100 µl of MTT (Sigma) in PBS at a concentration of 
5mg/ml was added to each well. The culture dish was wrapped 
in an aluminum foil and incubated for 4h at 37 . After 4 h ℃
incubated, remove the medium and MTT from the wells and 
added 400 µl DMSO per well. The solution was transfer in 96 
well culture dishes. Then read the OD of the plates at 570nm on 
ELISA plate reader. 
2-5 Preparation for Optical Microscopy and SEM 
Substrata were then dehydrated by critical point drying 
and were followed by gold sputtering. The samples were 
examined at 15kV in a JEOL JAX-840A. The well dishes were 
stained (Sttute method) with hematoxylin and eosin stain for 
population observation. 
2-6 Animal Experiment 
The prepared dressing materials were then covered onto 
the created hole and fixed with 4-0 nylon. The rabbits were 
scarified after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of operation. 
 
3. Results 
3-1 Microstructure of the Developed Tri-layer Dressing 
The trilayer wound dressing was shown in Fig.2. The 
sponge structure showed a uniform pore size about 20µm - 100 
µm with interconnection structure. 
3-2 MTT Analysis 
Fig.3 shows the results of MTT analysis of all the test 
groups. The tests were divided into three groups. Group A is the 
control group, where the dermal fibroblasts are cultured in the 
Petri-dish. Group B and Group C are PP non-woven fabric and 
the developed tri-layer dressing, respectively. OD value at the 
first day for the group C is slightly higher than that of group A 
and group B but no significance difference. OD value of group 
C at day 3 and day 7 is about 0.21 and 0.28, respectively, which 
is much higher than that of the group A and group B. 
3-3 Cytokine Analysis 
The concentration of IL-8 for group A and group B 
showed no significant difference for all the test periods. The 
concentration is higher than that of group A and group B at day 
3 and day 7. The concentration of IL-8 for group C at the first 
day is only slightly higher than the group A and group B. The 
concentration of IL-1α (Fig.4) for all the test groups did not 
change with the cultured time. The IL-6 analysis for all the test
