The polysilicon is deposited with LPCVD and doped with phosphorous. TEOS silicon dioxide (denoted by 
sacox in figure 1) is used as the sacrificial material. The silicon dioxide right beneath the top two levels of 
polysilicon, i.e. sacox4 and sacox3, is planarized using a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process, 
which eliminates the topography resulting from the earlier steps of the fabrication.

3.2.1 DC characteristics of the type I devices 
Figures 6 and 7 show the dc characteristics of the type I devices with initial finger gaps of 1-μm, 2-μm, and 
3-μm. Each chart has two sets of experimental data: rotation about x-axis (red circular dots) and rotation 
about y-axis (blue triangular dots). It is clear that for each device a smaller driving voltage is required for 
x-axis rotation due to the more compliant x-axis torsion springs made of the thinner mmpoly1 layer. Also, 
the x-axis rotation exhibits a greater maximum scan angle, resulting in an imbalanced scan pattern.

In addition to the vertical comb capacitance, parallel-plate capacitance exists intrinsically between the 
mirror and fixed combs. The lateral instability of the comb drive and the rotational pull-in of the 
parallel-plate actuator compete to govern the maximum rotational angles. For the radial vertical combdrive 
actuator, lateral instability (also called lateral pull-in) causes an undesired twist motion which could result 
in contact between the movable and fixed fingers. A large ratio of ktwist to kx (ky) can effectively prevent the 
device from lateral pull-in, where kx (ky) is the spring constant of the x-axis (y-axis) rotation and ktwist is the 
spring constant for the twist motion. Based on the mechanical resonant frequencies listed in table 2, we 
observe that the ratios ftwist2/fx2 ( ktwist/kx) and ftwist2/fy2 ( ktwist/ky) are 2.56-2.57 and 0.97-0.98, 
respectively. The twist mode even exhibits a slightly lower resonant frequency than that of the 
y-axis rotation, which implies the y-axis rotation is more susceptible to the lateral instability due to 
the lower ktwist/ky ratio. The finger gap is another critical parameter determining the degree of the lateral 
instability. This is particularly conspicuous for radial comb drive since the finger gap spacing within a 
single device alters nonuniformly during rotation. A smaller initial finger gap results in a greater degree of 
lateral instability. 
Figures 10(a) and (b) summarize the dc characteristics of the eight type I devices for x- and y-axis rotations, 
respectively. Basically, a device with a smaller initial finger gap requires a lower driving voltage to tilt the 
micromirror to a certain angle. This result agrees with the fact that a smaller finger gap leads to a larger 
force density. Particularly, for our radial combdrive design, the device with a smaller finger gap also 
possesses more fingers, further increasing the electrostatic torque. 
For x-axis rotation, devices with an initial gap of 1μm are verified to experience lateral pull-in whereas 
those with finger gaps of 2μm and 3μm are governed by the rotational pull-in. Figure 11(a) is the 
microscope image of device B2 after pull-in under x-axis actuation. It exhibits a twist, indicating that 
the moving comb fingers are laterally pulled toward the fixed fingers due to lateral instability. This 
phenomenon is not observed in devices with a gap of 2 μm or 3 μm [see figure 11(b)]. Therefore, 
the maximum mechanical scan angles for x-axis rotation of devices A1 and B2 (1-μm initial finger gap) are 
only 2.23° and 2.33°, respectively, which are much smaller than those of other devices. The angles of the 
2-μm-gap devices are greater than those of the 3-μm-gap ones. This is because the 2-μm-gap devices have 
larger comb capacitance, suppressing the contribution of the parallel-plate capacitance which causes the 
rotational pull-in. For the devices with a gap of 3μm, the required voltages for C1 and D2 are less than 
those for D1 and E2 because C1 and D2 have larger l2 and lo, which leads to stronger electrostatic torques. 
For y-axis rotation, the scan angles of all devices are determined by the lateral instability due to the smaller 
ktwist/ky. As anticipated, the 1-μm devices exhibit the smallest y-axis rotation angles. Moreover, the 
maximum angle of y-axis rotation is smaller than that of x-axis rotation for each device.

with initial finger gap = 1μm) and (b) device B1 (type I device with initial finger gap = 2 μm). 
 
3.2.2 DC characteristics of the type II devices 
Figure 12 shows the dc characteristics of the type II devices. The comparison between devices for both x- 
and y-axis rotations is demonstrated in figure 13. Resembling the type I devices in the imbalanced scan 
patterns, the type II devices require even higher driving voltages due to the greater stiffness of the 
double-beam lower springs. However, the employment of the double-beam lower springs not only increases 
the resistibility against lateral pull-in, but also suppresses the coupling-like behavior between x- and y-axis 
rotations. This can be theoretically predicted by the ANSYS modal analysis. From table 2, we find that the 
ratios ftwist2/fx2 ( ktwist/kx) and ftwist2/fy2 ( ktwist/ky) of type II devices are improved to 3.50-3.53 and 
2.16-2.17, respectively. The ratio fx2/fy2 ( kx/ky) is also increased from 0.38 to 0.61-0.62.  
The experimental data also confirm these enhancements. As observed in figure 13, devices with an initial 
finger gap of 1 μm (C3 and D3) achieve larger x-axis rotation angles in comparison with their counterparts 
of type I, even though they are still subject to lateral instability. Parallel-plate rotational pull-in still governs 
the devices with finger gaps of 2 μm and 3μm. E6 and E5 (initial finger gap = 2 μm) exhibit larger angles 
than E4 and E3 (initial finger gap = 3 μm) as explained earlier. Although the y-axis rotations of all type II 
devices still experience lateral pull-in, larger angles are achieved thanks to the better lateral stability. 
However, the maximum angle of y-axis rotation is still smaller than that of x-axis rotation for each device.

Along with the improvement of lateral stability comes the suppression of the coupling-like behavior 
between the x- and y-axis rotations. As shown in figure 14, each type II device experiences the induced 
x-axis tilt under y-axis actuation later than its type I counterpart with the same initial gap. 
3.2.3 DC characteristics of type III devices 
Figure 15 shows the dc characteristics of each device of type III. With modification of the cross-bar spring 
into a balanced structure, the primary two orthogonal rotational modes become degenerate and therefore we 
are able to achieve identical x- and y-axis scan ranges. As shown in table 2, the resonant frequencies of the 
two primary rotational modes for each device are almost the same as expected. The lateral stability is also 
improved due to the shorter torsion spring design. The ratios ftwist2/fx2 ( ktwist/ky) and ftwist2/fy2 ( ktwist/ky) are 
2.91, 2.91 and 3.50 for devices S1, S2 and S3, respectively. Thanks to the excellent lateral stability, the 
scan ranges of both x- and y-axis rotations reach large angles. Besides, no significant coupling-like 
behavior between the x- and y-axis rotations is observed. For devices S1 and S2, the x-axis rotation reaches 
the maximum angle when the far end of the y-axis spring touches the shielding ground plane. Their x-axis 
rotation ranges are 5.30° and 5.51°, respectively. These angles are smaller than the ideal maximum rotation 
room (6.05°) for two possible reasons: deviation of the thickness of the sacrificial SiO2 layer from the 
nominal value 2 μm and the sagging accompanied by the rotation motion. The sagging occurs as the 
electrostatic force exerting on the movable part not only provides a torque but also a net downward force.

3.2.4 DC characteristics of the devices with circular mirrors 
Figure 16(a) and (b) each compare devices that have the same spring structure and comb design but 
different mirror shapes (square and circular). With the mirrors intentionally cut into circular shapes, devices 
A2 and C2 bear almost no parallel-plate capacitance and are mainly driven by the radial vertical comb 
drives. They require higher driving voltages than their counterparts (B2 and D2) with square mirrors due to 
the lack of the parallel-plate capacitance between the mirror and fixed combs. As shown in figure 16, the 
characteristic difference between A2 and B2 (1-μm finger gap) is less significant than that between C2 and 
D2 (3-μm finger gap). This is attributed to the fact that for devices with a smaller finger gap a major 
portion of the total capacitance comes from the contribution of the comb drives. In other words, the

4. Conclusions and Self-Evaluation (結論及計畫成果自評) 
Novel two-axis MEMS scanners with radial vertical combdrive actuators have been demonstrated in this 
project. The devices are designed based on a five-layer polysilicon surface micromachining process. The 
cross-bar spring structure consisting of x-axis and y-axis torsion springs is incorporated to achieve two 
rotational degrees of freedom, enabling the dual-axis scanning. With the radial comb drives and cross-bar 
spring structure hidden underneath the mirror, the scanner can be replicated to form 1-D or 2-D arrays with 
high fill factors. Experiments on devices of different designs are performed and the results are analyzed. 
The optimal design (S1) comes with a balanced cross-bar spring structure. The mechanical rotation angles 
are ±5.30° (50.2V) and ±6.04° (52.8V) for rotations about the x and y axes, respectively. For each 
rotational mode, a significant angle is obtained under a reasonable bias voltage. The resonant frequencies 
are 11.4 kHz and 11 kHz. 
Two-axis micromirrors are the essential elements in a MEMS-based free-space optical communication 
(FSOC) system. Therefore, the devices which are successfully developed in this project can play an 
important role in boosting the FSOC technology.

FABRICATION 
Figure 2 is the simplified cross-section view along the 
A-B-C-D-E direction of Figure 1, depicting the structure 
details and the corresponding materials/layers. The device 
is fabricated with the MetalMUMPs process offered by 
MEMSCAP, Inc [15]. The fabrication flow is summarized 
as follows. First, a 2-μm thick isolation oxide (not shown in 
Figure 2) is grown on the n-type (100) silicon substrate, 
followed by the deposition and patterning of a sacrificial 
PSG (phosphosilicate glass) layer (0.5 μm thick). This 
patterned PSG layer defines the trench area. After that, the 
first silicon nitride and polysilicon layers (0.35 μm and 0.7 
μm thick, respectively) are deposited. Reactive ion etching 
(RIE) is used to pattern the polysilicon, followed by the 
deposition of the second silicon nitride layer (0.35 μm 
thick). Then, RIE removes the unwanted nitride. A second 
sacrificial PSG (1.1 μm thick) is deposited and opening 
areas are etched for anchoring the metal. Later on, the 
20-μm thick nickel is electroplated on the designated areas. 
On the top of the nickel, a 0.5-μm gold layer is always 
deposited in the fixed foundry process; however, its 
contribution is insignificant and it is not shown in the 
drawing of Figure 2. 49% HF solution is then used to etch 
away all the sacrificial PSG, leaving a gap between the 
nickel and nitride beams. Isolation oxide in the trench area 
is also removed in this step. Finally, a 25 μm deep trench 
on the silicon substrate is formed using KOH etching. The 
large clearance provided by this trench prevents the device 
from sticking to the substrate during the drying or 
operating stage. 
Figure 3 shows the optical microscope images of the 
device. In the close-up views, the embedded polysilicon is 
clearly seen. The dashed squares are locations where the 
suspended nickel and nitride structures are anchored to 
each other. The total length of the gripper (excluding the 
probing pads) is 2.15 mm. The initial gap spacing between 
the gripper tips is 8 μm, which is determined by the 
MetalMUMPs design rules. When electrical currents are 
fed into the in-plane moving parts, the gripper opens for 
slotting an object. The gripper closes and grabs the object 
after the current is reduced or removed.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
The schematic of the experimental setup is shown in 
Figure 4. The device is characterized using a high-quality 
high-magnification optical microscope equipped with an 
optical scale which has a resolution of 1 μm. The power 
supply, current meter, and the device are connected in 
series. For the measurement of in-plane motion, the 
displacement is observed and measured directly through 
the microscope. Under out-of-plane actuation, the 
microscope height is tuned during the measurement so that 
it remains focused on the gripper’s tip. The amount of 
tuning, which is equivalent to the vertical displacement of 
the tip, can be read from the optical scale. The 
experimental dc characteristics of the in-plane and 
out-of-plane modes are shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(b), 
respectively. The in-plane tip displacement is 83.7 μm at 
0.6 V whereas the out-of-plane movement is 98 μm at 87.2 
V.
