II.  MP CONTROL CHART 
 
MP control chart is constructed for monitoring 
multivariate Poisson count data. The control limits of MP 
chart are developed by exact probability method based on 
the sum of defects or nonconformities for each quality 
characteristics by Chiu and Kuo  [3]. 
Let variable Xj be the number of defects or 
nonconformities with respect to the observation i of 
quality characteristic j, i = 1, 2, …, m, j = 1, 2, …, p 
Assume that data X follows a jointly p-variate Poisson 
distribution.

X                   (1) 
Each Xj follows a Poisson distribution marginally 
with mean ( jλ ) and the covariance between two variables 
(Xj, Xk) is 0θ , kj ≠ . Define statistic D as the sum of all 
Xj:

The control limits then can be determined by taking 
the upper and lower 2/α  percentage points of the exact 
distribution. Hence, the UCL and LCL must be found:

The multivariate Poisson process with small mean 
values for each variable Xj generally leads to a small or 
zero value of statistic D. This would cause the probability 
P(D = 0) larger than 2/α  most of the time. If the 
probability P(D = 0) is greater than 2/α , LCL is set to be 
0 and only the UCL is investigated. Set false alarm to be α , then the UCL can be obtained:

If jλ  and 0θ  are unknown, their values can be 
estimated from the observed sample data. When the UCL 
is determined, we can plot statistic D on the MP chart and 
monitor the process. 
 
III.  RUN-LENGTH PERCENTILES 
 
 For each run length distribution of the MP chart 
examined, the value displays the following information: 
1) the 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles of the 
run length distribution. 
2) the 1st and 99th percentiles are the extremes. 
 The percentiles of the run length distribution provide 
more information about the performance of the chart than 
ARL. The median (50th percentile) is a more 
representative performance measure than the ARL. The 
computation of the MRL values that on average 50% of 
all the run lengths are less than the MRL will help avoid 
confusion among practitioners. The 25th, and 75th 
percentiles convey useful information since the middle 
half  of the distribution is contained between these values. 
For example, there is a 0.25 probability that the run-length 
of the chart will be less than the displayed 25th percentile, 
and a 0.25 probability that the run-length of the chart will 
be greater than the displayed 75th percentile. If the 
lengths of the value between the 5th and 25th percentile is 
smaller than the value between the 75th and 95th 
percentile, this then illustrates the extreme right skew of 
this run-length distribution. The values of the 1st and 99th 
percentiles could be omitted if the user is less concerned 
with these extremes or if the severe right skew of a run 
length distribution warrants this omission.   
 
 
IV.  SIMULATION STUDY AND COMPARISON 
 
 Evaluation of the run-length percentiles for the 
mulativariate Poisson charts is implemented in Matlab 
R2007a. Consider a bivariate Poisson distributed with 
mean λ  for each variable. The value of λ  is 0.5. Thus λ  
would change with δ  and ρ . If δ  is defined as the shift 
size of covariance 0θ , then the shift amount of covariance 
is 0δθ . When δ  is equal to 1, then λ  does not change, 
which means that the process is in an in-control state. 
Otherwise, when δ  is larger than 1, λ  changes to 
( 10 θδθ + ) and the process is in an out-of-control state. 
Tables I and II give the ARL, SDRL, percentage points of 
the run-length distribution for δ  = 1(0.5)6, and p = 2 of 
the MP chart for ρ = 0.2 and 0.5, respectively under α  = 
0.0027. The ARL, SDRL, percentage points of the run-
length distribution for δ  = 1(0.5)6, and p = 3 of the MP 
chart for ρ = 0.2 and 0.5 are give in Tables III and IV, 
respectively. 
 From Tables I–IV, it is clearly seen that the in-control 
MRL for p = 2 and 3, and ρ = 0.2 and 0.5 are less than
