type Ⅰ to Ⅱ. Exchanged water volume per one time of type Ⅰ to Ⅵ air-lift columns 
is 0.41, 0.82, 0.61, 0.08, 0.82, 2.86 liters. Comparing with design factors, ratio 
of inner tube volume and ratio of diameter and height of inner tube are not main 
factors which affect aeration efficiency. Ratio of diameter and height of air room 
should be larger than 1. Ratio of air room cross-section area and ratio of air room 
volume should be increased to about 7 for advancing the standard aeration efficiency 
of air-lift column to about 1.5.  
Using distribution of flow field to determine radius of ability of mixing the 
water volume at  1 m water depth, type Ⅲ air-lift column is 3 meter, type Ⅴ air-lift 
column is 3.5 meter and type Ⅵ air-lift column is 5 meter. Select the best air-lift 
column, type Ⅵ, to proceed the experiment of improving water quality. The ability 
of increasing dissolved oxygen of water outlet of type Ⅵ air-lift column promotes 
dissolved oxygen of water volume about 1 mg/L in 20 minutes. The max exchanged volume 
of water per NT dollar of type Ⅵ air-lift column is about 178.8 ton at 1 m water 
depth. Otherwise, intermittent time of air-lift column is decreased when pumping 
velocity increases and increased when water depth increases. We can use interpolation 
to get intermittent time of different types of air-lift columns at different water 
depth with different pumping velocities. According to the achievement of this study, 
we can choose a suitable air-lift column to set up depends on different water 
qualities and the purpose of environmental improvement in the future.
