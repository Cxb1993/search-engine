Abstract. This article focused on the performance of the stages of plotting a 
haptic straight-line on swell paper with two different rulers, Ruler S and Ruler 
C, for blind subjects and blindfolded subjects. Five tasks were performed, free-
line, constrained-line, extension-line, closing-line, and conjoining-line. The 
stages of straight-line drawing were identified as searching, positioning, and 
plotting, each being recorded in terms of complete time. The deviation of line 
length, start point, and end point were also measured. The t-test showed that the 
blinds spent longer time than blindfolds did at each stage for all tasks. 
Comparing the performance between Ruler S and Ruler C being used, the 
former needed longer complete time than the latter did at the plotting stage. A 
paired t-test indicated that the blinds using the Ruler S spent longer time at the 
searching, plotting stage than blindfolds did. But the blindfolds spent longer 
time at the positioning stage with Ruler C. There were no significant 
differences between these two rulers in terms of deviation of length, and start 
point. The end point of the line drawn with Ruler S tended to exceed the 
expected position, while the Ruler C tended to a little shortage. Concluded that 
the new design of ruler, Ruler C, was superior at the plotting stage, but needed 
to be improved at the positioning stage. Implications for further design were 
discussed.

1   Introduction 
The task of plotting a line on a paper is an easy job to sighted people, which is the 
same to a blind person. However, when asking to draw a line as exactly as required, 
the blinds would face a situation of sensing the precise points of the line without 
visual contacts and measuring the length of the line with tactual sensors. The work 
here was a research project supported by the National Science Council, which was to 
  
pen to draw the line till the end point required. In order to find out the differences of 
performance between the two rulers, the design team conducts five tasks in this 
experiment. The tasks, free-line, constrained-line, extension-line, closing-line, and 
conjoining-line, are the possible conditions that could happen at practice of plotting a 
line on paper. Researchers are interested in the outcomes of those three stages 
performed by the two different rulers. The free-line task is only to verify that the 
subject already known how to use the rulers, so the data of this task is discarded.  
2   Methods 
The participants were 12 blinds, volunteered from the Taipei Association of 
Visual Impairment, which were 7 males from 25 to 55 years old (M=37.2) and 5 
females from 30 to 42 years old (M=37.6), among the blinds were 5 CB and 7 LB; 12 
blindfolds recruited from Tatung university, which were 6 males from 21 to 26 years 
old (M=23.6) and 6 females from 20 to 23 years old (M=21.8).  
The experimenter had prepared swell papers for 5 straight-line tasks, which were: 
(1) free-line task: a blank paper, and the subject was asked to draw a free length of 
straight line; (2) constrained-line: a  blank paper, and the subject was asked to draw a 
3 units long of straight line; (3) extension-line: a paper with a dot in the left side, and 
the subject was asked to draw a line from the dot (start  point) to a 3 units away to the 
right; (4) closing-line: a paper with a dot in the right side, subject was asked to draw a 
line from the left side (3 units away from the dot) to this dot (end-point); (5) 
conjoining-line: 2 dots at the opposite side of the paper in a 5 units distance, the 
subject was asked to link the 2 dots with a straight line. A video camera was located 
on the left front side to see the overall action of the participant and the other camera 
located on the front top of the subject to observe the movement of his hands. The 
participant has a free time to practice the two rulers and ask any questions about the 
function of their components. When they reported ready for the experiment, the free-
line task conducted to verify whether the subject actually understand the operations of 
the rulers. The other four tasks were randomly assigned to the subjects in order to 
prevent possible bias among tasks, also the order of operating Ruler S or Ruler C first 
was randomly assigned. The complete time of each stage of those tasks were recorded 
by the video cameras. Also the deviations of the line were measured, including the 
position of start point, end point, and the length of the line. 
3 Results 
In order to know the differences between the subjects, the sums of each stage of 
all tasks were calculated, including the complete time and deviation, Table 1. The 
two sample t-test showed there was a significant difference between the subjects at 
the position stage, t (46) = 3.414, p= .001, and the plotting stage, t (46) = 4.025, p= .000. 
This indicated that the blindfolds spent less time at the two stages than blinds, that is, 
the blindfolds had a better performance than the blind subjects at these two stages of 
straight-line activities. Between the rulers, there was a significant difference showed 
at plotting stage, t (46) = 2.036, p= .047, indicated that the Ruler C (M=51.28) took less
