2price and lot sizing for a retailer under the condition of permissible delay in payments. Teng (2002)
provided an alternative conclusion from Goyal (1985), and proved that it makes economic sense for
a well-established buyer to order less quantity and take the benefits of the permissible delay more
frequently. Chang et al. (2003) developed an EOQ model for deteriorating items under supplier
credits linked to ordering quantity. Huang (2003) extended Goyals model to develop an EOQ model
in which the supplier offers the retailer the up-stream trade credit period M, and the retailer in turn
provides the down-stream trade credit period N (with NM) to his/her customers. Teng and Goyal
(2007) complemented the shortcoming of Huangs model and proposed a generalized formulation.
Teng (2009) established an EOQ model for a retailer who offers distinct trade credits to its good and
bad credit customers. Chang et al. (2010) presented the optimal manufacturers replenishment
policies in a supply chain with up-stream and down-stream trade credits. Recently, Teng et al. (2011)
obtained the retailers optimal ordering policy when the supplier offers a progressive permissible
delay in payments. Some related articles can be found in Chang et al. (2008, 2010a, 2010b), Goyal
et al. (2007), Huang (2004, 2007), Huang and Hsu (2008), Liao (2008), Ouyang et al. (2005, 2006),
Shinn and Hwang (2003), Teng and Chang (2009), and their references.
In all these articles described above, the inventory models are studied only from the perspective of
the buyer whereas in practice the length of the credit period is set by the vendor. So far, how to
determine the optimal length of the credit period for the vendor has received a very little attention by
the researchers. Abad and Jaggi (2003) determined both the sellers and the buyers policies under
non-cooperative as well as cooperative relationships. However, in their model, the demand rate was
not affected by offering a permissible delay. Jaggi et al. (2008) developed the optimal credit as well
as replenishment policy jointly for the vendor when credit period has a positive impact on demand.
However, Jaggi et al. (2008) only focused on the vendor, and did not study the interaction between
the vendor and the buyer. Lately, Chern et al. (2011a) developed the Nash equilibrium solution in a
vendor-buyer supply chain model with permissible delay in payments. On the other hand, Chern et
al. (2011b) also developed the Stackelberg solution in a vendor-buyer supply chain model with
permissible delay in payments.
For example, m and n are vendors decision variables and t is buyers decision variable. Vendors
and buyers profit objective function are TPv(m, n, t)、Fb(m, n, t) respectively.
Nash equilibrium solution:
(m*, n*, t*) is a Nash equilibrium solution if the following conditions hold:
TPv(m*, n*, t*)TPv(m, n, t*) for every m and n, and
TPb(m*, n*, t*)TPb(m*, n*, t) for every t.
Stackelberg equilibrium solution:
We assume that there is a hierarchy among the vndors and buyers and vendor is the high-level
decision- makers. (m*, n*, t*) is a Stackelberg equilibrium solution if it is the optimal solution of
the following two-level optimization model.

If buyer is the high-level decision maker, we can formulate the two-level optimization model in
a similar way. In this research, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to obtain the
optimal solution for both the vendor and the buyer under non-cooperative Stackelberg equilibrium.
Pareto efficient solutions:
We may also consider the following multi-objective optimization problem and solve the Pareto
42.2. Assumptions:
The following assumptions are made to establish the inventory model.
1. We assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that the selling price is constant in todays global
competition and low inflation environment.
2. As stated in Jaggi et al. (2008),it is observed that credit period offered by the retailer to its
customers has a positive impact on demand of an item.For simplicity, we may assume that the
buyers demand rate D(m) with the vendors trade credit of m periods is given by
makemD )( , where k and a are positive constants. (1)
For convenience, D(m) and D will be used interchangeably.
3. Since the longer the credit period to the buyer, the higher the default risk, we may assume WLOG
that the rate of not receiving debt obligations giving the credit period m is
mbemf 1)( , where b is a positive constant. (2)
4. If tm, then the buyer pays the entire purchase amount to the vendor at time m. Otherwise, the
buyer deposits sales revenue into an interest bearing account until m. At the end of the
permissible delay, the retailer pays off all units sold, uses unsold items as collateral to apply for a
loan, and pays the bank a certain amount of money periodically until the loan is paid off at time t.
5. Both the vendor and the buyer know their own and the others profits. This is a simplification of
reality, but a necessary first step for understanding motivations in a vendor-buyer supply chain
model with permissible delay in payments. Addressing the simpler situation of complete
information should suggest how to subsequently analyze the more realistic, but also more
difficult situation in which the vendor and the buyer have incomplete information about his/her
own and the others profit parameters.
6. Replenishment rate is instantaneous.
7. Shortages are not allowed.
8. Time horizon is infinite.
3. Mathematical models
In two-player equilibrium problems, each player has its profit objective function and decision
variables. We establish the annual profit function for the vendor first, and then for the buyer.
3.1. Vendors annual profit
Since the vendor receives the buyers purchase amount at time m with the rate of default
risk mbemf 1)( , the vendors annual revenue is
(Pv mbe ) mre D = kPv mrbae )]([  . (3)
For the vendor, the production cycle time is nt, the setup cost per year is Sv / (nt), and the process
cost per year is (nF) / (nt) = F/t. We know from Figure 1 that the vendors on-hand inventory is
equal to the area of the shaded region OEFGBD.
Area of region OEFGBD

6the leader), the buyer (i.e., the follower) finds its optimal t to maximize its own profit. By knowing
the buyers optimal t as a function of m and n, the vendor then selects the optimal m and n so that its
profit is maximized. As a result, we must solve Stackelberg problem reversely as follows:
Step 1. For any given policies m and n by the vendor, the buyer maximizes its profit to find its
optimal t as a function of m and n.
Step 2. The vendor substitutes the buyers optimal t into its profit function, and then find its own
optimal policies m and n to maximize its profit. Finally, the buyer obtains its optimal t based on the
vendors optimal policies m and n.
5.1. Necessary Conditions

From (9)–(14), we can obtain the following theoretical result.
Theorem 1. Let )(2)( 2 ebbb IPHDmSm  . For any given m, we obtain:
(a) If 0 , then the optimal replenishment cycle time is mt * as shown in (13).
(b) If 0 , then the optimal replenishment cycle time is mt * as shown in (14).
(c) If 0 , then the optimal replenishment cycle time is .* mt 
Proof. See Chern et al. (2011).
A simple economic interpretation of Theorem 1 is as follows. It is clear from the classical EOQ
model or Teng (2009) that the optimal order quantity is obtained when the ordering cost is equal to
the inventory cost. Whenever the retailer orders, it receives the benefit of Dm2 Pb Ie/2 from the
suppliers trade credit. As a result, the true ordering cost is reduced to (Sb–Dm2 Pb Ie/2). The
inventory cost (excluding interest charges) for order Dm units is Dm2Hb/2. Therefore, if the true
ordering cost is higher than the inventory cost for order Dm units, then the optimal order quantity
*Q ( *Dt ) must be higher than Dm units (i.e., mt * ), and vice versa. Notice that if the condition
in (13) is false, then 0)(2 2  cbebb ICIPDmS , and

7. Numerical examples
In order to illustrate the theoretical results, we provide the following examples.
Example 1. Let Sv = $120/cycle, Sb = $40/order, F = $10/order, R = 20000 units/year, Pv =
$1.50/unit, Pb = $2.50/unit, Cv = $0.50/unit, Cb = $1.50/unit, Hv = $0.25/unit/year, Hb =
$0.50/unit/year, Ie = 0.05/year, Ic = 0.05/year, r = 0.04/year, a = 1, b = 0.50, and memD 3600)( 
units.
For the case of tm , the solution to maximize (33) is 1n , 1t , 1m , 022.0 , and
45.7801),,,( tnmTP . Similarly, for the other case of tm , the solution maximizing (34) is
1n , 1t , 1m , 172.0 , and 69.7054),,,( tnmTP . By comparing both cases, we get
1* n , 1* t , 1* m , and 022.0*  . We then compare Nash, Stackelberg and Pareto,equilibrium
(e.g., see Chern et al. (2011a) and Chern et al. (2011b)) solutions as shown in Table 1.

Example 2. Using the same data as in Example 1, we provide the sensitivity analysis on the
equilibrium solution with respect to each parameter. The computational results are shown in Table 2.
