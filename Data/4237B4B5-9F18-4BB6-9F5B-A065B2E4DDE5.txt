二︾緣由與目的  
Cooperative wireless communications work 
jointly with multiple intermediate relays to 
send information to the same receiving station 
in order to improve the detection efficiency at 
the destination receiver. The cooperative 
wireless communications have been 
considered to be used in the futuristic wireless 
communication systems to achieve spatial 
diversity gain through a virtual MIMO 
architecture in both point-to-multi-point (PMP) 
and mesh networks. Also, it is widely known 
 4 
cooperative wireless communication works in 
a way very similar to an MIMO system in the 
uplink. Thus, many people call it as a virtual 
MIMO system.  
 
The cooperative wireless communication may 
involve several different mobile terminals 
within the same cell, and they ought to work 
jointly in a cooperative way. Therefore, 
cooperative wireless communication system 
forms a complex system and its performance 
modeling and analysis is extremely 
challenging. This sub-project in fact also 
worked closely with the other sub-projects on 
cognitive radio and other advanced wireless 
technologies in order to design an intelligent 
radio architecture to provide high-speed all IP 
wireless communications. The research works 
proposed in this sub-project may also need to 
consider heterogeneous network environment, 
where many different tiers of networks may 
co-exist and incorporate with each other. 
Therefore, although this project will be 
concentrated very much on the physical layer 
architecture, some upper layer issues related 
to cooperative wireless communications have 
also been addressed. For instance, the code 
channel assignment schemes used in 
cooperative wireless network environment 
should be worked out to optimize the overall 
system resource utilizations. This deals with 
the design of an efficient MAC protocol for 
multiple access and collision avoidance. 
Another example for the upper layer 
involvement in this sub-project is its possible 
application of network coding for cooperative 
wireless communication networking. For this 
part of the work, one MSc student has been 
working extensively to do a lot of 
investigations on how to design a feasible 
scheme to incorporate network coding in a 
cooperative wireless communication system.   
 
It is widely recognized that the cooperative 
wireless communication is an important 
research topic for the futuristic wireless 
communication systems, and it has attracted a 
great amount of attention from both academia 
and industry in the world, as shown in the 
major reference list attached to this section 
below. Many important initiatives have been 
started in many universities and research 
facilities of the wireless industry around the 
world [1]-[18]. It is noted that 3GPP LTE 
system has adopted cooperative wireless 
communication as an important element in its 
overall air-link architecture, as indicated in the 
references [7]-[9]. 
 
On the other hand, we have to admit that 
multiple access technology will still play a 
pivotal role in the cooperative wireless 
communications due to the fact that it works 
based on the involvement of multiple entities: 
different terminals on the same network tier, 
as well as those working on distinct networks 
tiers. The choice of the right multiple access 
technology is critical to the successful 
operation of the cooperative wireless 
communications. In this proposed sub-project 
(under the umbrella of the main-project titled 
“Cooperative and Cognitive Networking 
toward 4G Wireless Communications”), we 
have been working extensively to investigate 
various important issues related to cooperative 
wireless communication based on the next 
generation OFDM/CDMA technology, a new 
multiple access technology proposed by us 
recently. We have obtained very encouraging 
results to show the great importance of the 
choice of the right multiple access technology 
in a cooperative wireless communication 
system. 
 
It is worth to mention that we have started to 
work on cooperative wireless communications 
almost at the same time when it was first 
proposed in the literature quite many years 
ago. Several publications of our works in this 
area have been put into the publication queue 
of major technical publications, as shown in 
the references [19]-[21]. However, the works 
published by us so far are very much 
concentrated on the generic virtual MIMO 
systems and they have not yet touched the 
issues on the applications of the next 
generation OFDM/CDMA technology in 
cooperative wireless communications. 
Therefore, the research work proposed in this 
project has been a starting point for us to work 
on many innovative system designs of a 
cooperative wireless communication system 
based on the next generation OFDM/CDMA 
technology, which will be able to offer a 
superb performance in terms of its capability 
to deliver a very high transmission rate and a 
robust performance under various operational 
environments. 
 6 
cooperative relay together in one wireless 
communication system design in order to 
achieve both bandwidth efficiency and 
diversity gain. We are now working to write a 
few papers based on the results obtained from 
the work in this respect and hopefully they 
could be published in good technical journals 
very soon.  
 
四︾Summary 
As this research project has come to the end 
very soon, it is a good time for us to review 
what we have gone through during the 
previous two years. One thing I have to 
mention is that we have achieved a lot of 
interesting research results from the previous 
two years. Based on the results obtained 
through this research project, we are now 
preparing several papers to be submitted to 
conferences and journals.

The	  report	  for	  my	  conference	  attendance	  
	  
I	  used	  the	  funding	  given	  to	  my	  NSC	  project	  NSC	  98-­‐2219-­‐E-­‐006-­‐011	  to	  
attend	  a	  conference	  held	  in	  ICC	  2010	  Cap	  Town,	  the	  South	  Africa,	  in	  June	  
2010.	  
The	  major	  objectives	  for	  this	  visit	  were	  for	  research	  exchange	  with	  my	  
colleagues	  and	  friends	  who	  attended	  ICC	  2010	  held	  in	  Cape	  Town	  of	  
South	  Africa.	  I	  gave	  a	  presentation	  in	  the	  conference,	  and	  I	  had	  a	  great	  
opportunity	  to	  strengthen	  the	  ties	  with	  my	  old	  friends	  and	  got	  to	  know	  
many	  new	  friends	  there,	  via	  active	  discussions	  with	  many	  people	  coming	  
from	  both	  academia	  and	  the	  wireless	  industry	  in	  the	  world.	  Therefore,	  
the	  visit	  was	  very	  fruitful	  and	  successful.	  At	  the	  same	  time,	  I	  can	  also	  
have	  a	  lot	  of	  chances	  to	  discuss	  with	  them	  on	  the	  research	  topics	  of	  our	  
mutual	  interest.	  In	  this	  visit,	  I	  was	  able	  to	  attend	  several	  sessions	  of	  the	  
conference,	  and	  they	  were	  indeed	  very	  interesting	  and	  meaningful	  to	  
me.	  This	  was	  partly	  because	  it	  was	  the	  first	  time	  for	  me	  to	  attend	  a	  
conference	  in	  Africa	  continent,	  even	  though	  I	  have	  known	  the	  fact	  that	  
this	  conference	  is	  one	  of	  the	  most	  influential	  conferences	  in	  the	  world	  in	  
the	  areas	  of	  wireless	  communication	  research.	  One	  of	  the	  major	  
differences	  from	  many	  other	  major	  conferences	  organized	  by	  IEEE	  is	  that	  
ICC	  is	  held	  usually	  in	  a	  country	  of	  the	  world	  outside	  North	  America.	  
Therefore,	  this	  time	  I	  had	  a	  great	  chance	  to	  meet	  many	  people	  from	  
academia	  as	  well	  as	  from	  different	  wireless	  industrial	  companies,	  such	  as	  
LG,	  Nokia,	  RIM,	  Samsung,	  Huawei,	  ZTE,	  NTTDoCoMo,	  etc.	  	  
I	  was	  recognized	  by	  the	  organizer	  of	  ICC	  2010,	  i.e.,	  IEEE	  Communications	  
Society,	  as	  an	  IEEE	  Fellow	  in	  the	  conference,	  and	  this	  itself	  was	  a	  great	  
honor	  for	  me,	  as	  well	  as	  to	  NCKU,	  as	  everyone	  knew	  I	  am	  from	  NCKU,
