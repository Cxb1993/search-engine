結構物之損壞識別在於從利用所量測之訊號進行分析。當進行分析量測資料時，主要在萃取重要
之結構反應特徵。由所得之特徵可用來判別結構物之損壞狀況及作用外力之情況。有兩種方式可用於
萃取結構反應之特徵。其一為採用以結構模式為基礎之方法，以識別出有物理量之結構參數。然而此
採用以結構模式為基礎之識別方式，須要有參考值之提供(即結構未破壞下之狀態)。另一方法則以量
測訊號為基礎之反應特徵萃取。此方法直接採用量測訊號進行分析，並配合所判定之非線性損壞函數，
以決定現階段結構物之狀況。本研究之主要重點在利用訊號分析之技術，發展結構物健康診斷及損壞
識別方法。 配合國科會補助之現階段研究計劃成果(NSC NO.2221-E-002-121-MY1- MY2- MY3 
(2006-2009))，已建置完成一套無線傳輸模組(WSU)。利用此 WSU，可進行持續性結構健康診斷之監測
及損壞識別，但可靠之量測訊號及精準之訊號分析及萃取特徵為對結構監測之重要診斷。本年度之研
究重點則分別簡述如下： 
 建構一可靠無線感測模組(WSU)可進行長期之結構反應監測，並結合分析軟體進行即時及連續性之
結構物特性之萃取。(以 cRIO 9022 為 Host Node 來進行資料之分析)。 
 發展即時及持續性訊號分析及損壞識別方法(著重在 Recursive Stochastic Subspace 
Identification 之識別，如即時瞬時頻率之識別等萃取方式)。

1. Development of A Wireless Sensing Network System for Bridge Monitoring  
The objective of this research is to develop a reliable wireless sensing module which can provide the 
requirements of autonomous monitoring of structure under its operating condition, which include 1) reliable 
wireless data communication, 2) a hardware with accurate signal conditioner for ambient vibration sensors 
(VSE-15D), 3) capable for continuous long-term monitoring.  Based on the prototype of WiMMS (Stanford 
University unit), a wireless sensing unit, called NTU-WSU, is developed to meet these requirements. With the 
developed wireless sensing module and integrate with the sensing nodes (sensor) and server node (cRIO-9022, 
a high-performance programmable automation controller), the smart sensing system for bridge structure 
continuous monitoring is formed. Structural system identification software (Covariance-Driven Recursive 
Stochastic Subspace Identification, RSSI-COV) is embedded at host node to extract the dynamic 
characteristics of the bridge. Integrate the wireless sensing module and the software on multivariate on-line 
signal processing the smart bridge sensing system is developed. 
MOTIVATION: A structural health monitoring (SHM) based on real time data is being adopted 
increasingly for some existing bridges. It is a new concept to the field of civil engineering to monitor 
structural behavior in real-time, evaluate structural performance under various loads and identify structural 
damage or deterioration, in order to assess the structural health conditions. However, regardless the data 
analysis technologies, data communication through wire and optical cables in monitoring the large civil 
infrastructure always become a problem. The advancement in wireless technology has provided motives to the

2. Develop Data-Driven Recursive Stochastic subspace Identification Algorithm  
One of the advantages of the subspace identification algorithms lies in the use of multivariate 
output-error state-space algorithm and through the orthogonal projection to best estimate of response 
measurements. Generally, singular value decomposition (SVD) and LQ decomposition will be used in SSI 
which leads to the stability and reliability of this technique. However, the traditional SSI is not suitable for 
on-line computation because of the computational complexity of SVD and LQ decomposition; therefore it can 
not be apply to identify the time-varying system modal parameters in on-line and real-time or almost real-time 
application.  
For on-line structural health monitoring the recursive identification technique will be used. Several 
recursive subspace identification algorithms have been proposed to avoid the use of singular value 
decomposition so as to reduce the computation time. Two steps are required to conduct recursive subspace 
identification: (1) update the LQ decomposition; (2) update the column space of extended observability matrix. 
The first step implies that the LQ decomposition needs to be updated as long as there is a new set of data 
provided which may need computation times. In this study a new method, Givens rotation together with 
matrix operation, will be introduced to replace this tradition LQ decomposition. The second step was to 
develop methodology to update the LQ decomposition using appending only one column data set to the block 
data Hankel matrix.  
A bridge scouring test data was used to verify the applicability of the proposed RSS-DATA algorithm for 
the identification of time-varying system natural frequencies. It is important to note that to extract the system 
dynamic characteristics from the observation matrix, distinguish the true modes from the noise modes

1. Develop damage detection indices for on-line Structural Health Monitoring 
On-line estimation on damage indices are proposed in this research: 
a. Damage Sensitive Feature (DSF) Based on AR Model 
The most robust damage sensitive feature is provided by the first AR coefficient normalized by the square root 
of the sum of the squares of the first three AR coefficients. Using the acceleration signal, two damage 
sensitive features (DSF) are defined as follows:

accDSF
α

=
+ +
  
where α1, α2 and α3 are the first three AR coefficients. It is important to point out that different types of 
damage needs to consider different system poles to construct the AR-model coefficients. For example, damage 
caused by the change of system low frequencies will need some lower modes poles to construct the AR-model 
coefficient. On the contrary, if damage caused by high frequencies modes may need some higher modes poles 
to construct the coefficient. 
b. Null-space and Sub-space damage indices 
The singular value decomposition (SVD) of an analytic matrix X is defined as: 
            
TUSVX =  (1) 
where X is an L×K analyzed matrix; U is an L×L unitary matrix; S is an L×K rectangular diagonal matrix with 
nonnegative real number on the diagonal; V is an K×K unitary matrix. Diagonal entries of S are known as 
singular values of X. L columns of U and K columns of V are called left singular vectors and right singular 
vectors of X, respectively, and denote U = [u1, u2, …, uL], V = [v1, v2, …, vK] and S=[diag(s1, s2, …, sL), 
s1≧s2≧…≧sL] for L<K. In SVD the sub-spaces and null-spaces of an analytic matrix can be defined as:

= ][][   if 0Sn =  (2) 
where Us and Vs are subspaces of matrix X spanned by left singular vectors and right singular vectors 
corresponding to non-zero singular values respectively; Un and Vn are null-spaces of matrix X spanned by left 
singular vectors and right singular vectors corresponding to zero singular values respectively. From the 
distribution of singular spectrum S, Two group of singular value can be identified: Ss contain all non-zero 
singular values (or significant values) and Sn contains all zero singular values (or insignificant small values). 
If Sn contains small singular values )( 0Sn ≈ , then the matrix X can be reconstructed using two subspaces Us , 
Vs and non-zero singular value matrix Ss, i.e. *sss VSUX ≈  
    To define the dimension of sub-space (or null-space), P singular value can be selected from S-matrix. An 
index Csvd is defined:

i i
p

C)ss( ≥∑∑

 (4) 
where Csvd is a pre-defined parameter which will be used to select the principal singular value P. Based on this, 
the subspaces and null-spaces of the analytic matrix can be determined as: 
 8
               
0UU Tn0s =  or 0VV Tn0s =   if monitor system is undamaged
 
(13a) 
            
0UU Tn0s ≠  or 0VV Tn0s ≠   if monitor system is damage (13a) 
For computation simplicity, consider only the subspace and null-space spanned by left singular vector. The 
damaged indicator DIn based on the null-space of the matrix X0 can be defined as the absolute mean value of 
the matrix evaluated from subspace and null-space: 
         
}{ Tn0sUUmeanDIn =  (14) 
where mean{} evaluates the mean value of all elements of matrix in {} and || makes all elements of matrix 
positive. The value of DIn ranges from 0 to 1.  
The subspaces of matrix X0 and X are also satisfied the orthogonal properties as shown in Eq. (10a):

Using Eq. (15), the difference between two subspaces can be checked by evaluating the projection of the 
column vector of the matrix X on the subspace of the matrix X0 as:

Different from the RSSI-DATA analysis, a Covariance-Driven recursive SSI algorithm is developed. The 
method can have more effective to remove the noise effect of the measurement. The algorithm for RSSI-COV 
is shown in the following flow chart:

3. Damage Identification Using Optical Displacement Laser Sensor 
For the vibration measurement of structure, different from the traditional sensors, such as accelerometer or 
velocity meter, the optical sensing system can also be used. The advantage of using optical sensor is the small 
size of the sensor and can be distributed for local dynamic measurement. For example, consider a shaking 
table test of the 2-bay one story RC frame. To measure the seismic response of the frame the accelerometers 
are distributed at the top and bottom of the frame structure. To measure the local behavior of the frame a set 
of optical sensor is also distributed at the top and bottom of the central column of the frame, as shown in 
Figure 11.

Suffix 1, , nK  represents order of optical sensors in the experiment. This kind of coordinate representation is 
called homogenous coordinates. The adding coordinate of value 1 conducts the application of translation. 
Therefore, the transform matrix T  between these two ensemble matrices can perform both rotation and 
translation of the vector space. To get the transform matrix T  at the second step, division of two ensemble 
matrices is calculated. That is

As soon as the coordinate transform matrix T  between design and optical system is known, the optical 
measurement over time can be transform into the design coordinate system by left multiplying T , that is 
 
( ) ( ).correct measuret t=TPP   (3) 
Therefore, data in ( )correct tP  will show in the design coordinate system we define. 
The target positions originally are determined at the design stage and then marked onto the test specimen, 
and therefore 
,correct initP  of affine transformation result should be the same as design position d e s ig nP  at the 
initial stage. But actually there are slightly differences between them according to the mark imperfection, 
shifting of target position are employed to eliminate the differences. Thus, the resulting measurements can 
compare to the design. Shifting process is done by finding the translation matrix 
,d e s ig n c o r r ec t in i t= −M PP  at 
initial stage. After translation matrix M is determined, the measurement over time can be revised by 
following equation, 
                   
( ) ( ) .

These two methods including affine transformation and shifting of target position are the main optical data 
preprocessing techniques used in this experiment study. Thus, the following analysis will utilize ( )
revise tP  as 
the data of optical measurement.

each node can be observed, especially for node #9 which is near to the most severe scouring bridge pier. ERD 
result for each node is very large at some instant between 120~180min. This is resulted from the low 
frequency velocity impulse induced by the settlement of the bridge pier and deck. It is very time consuming to 
evaluate ERD for each row size of Hankel matrix. For real application, it is more suitable to evaluate ERD 
value under a specific size of Hankel matrix. Figure 20(a) shows ERD result of the response at node #3, node 
#6 and node #9 by using the row size of Hankel matrix L=8 (which is approximately equal to the critical row 
size of the initial response as shown in Figure 19. Figure 20 (b) shows the system frequency result by using 
covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification (SSI-COV) [13] and measured responses at node#3, #6

also show the embedded depth of each bridge pier and the vertical displacement of the bridge pier #3.

The objective of this paper is to discuss two different categories on structural damage detection. One is the 
centralized feature extraction technique by using multi-sensor architecture and the other is the pattern-level 
data analysis by using the extracted features from each individual sensor. The covariance-driven stochastic 
subspace identification and multivariate singular spectrum analysis are applied for the centralized feature 
extraction. For pattern-level feature recognition either wavelet packet transforms, or power spectral density 
function or correlation function among sensing records is used. Through both centralized and pattern-level 
feature extraction the results can not only detect the occurrence of structural damage but also can locate the 
damage. Finally, the dynamic finite element model updating is used for damage quantification. Verification of 
the proposed algorithms by using a research-scale bridge scouring test model to detect the damage occurrence 
and severity during scouring is presented. Finally, discussion on the computation effectiveness among 
different method is made.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) method can be classified as model-based and non-model 
based. The model-based method identified damage by correlating an analytical model with test modal data of 
the damaged structure. To detect damage under such category, a high quality of finite element model is 
required but it is often difficult to achieve. Non-model based damage detection method is using the response 
measurement directly and to observe the extracted features directly from the measurements between intact and 
damage state of the structure. To ensure that systems are operating within defined conditions, measurements 
are taken which, when analyzed, enable decisions to be made based on condition. These measurements can 
produce data that are either very similar, or completely different from different techniques. Experienced 
engineers and analysts have traditionally undertaken the analysis of this data. However, with the increased 
computer power and the development of new and novel detection method, the data produced needs to be 
handled in a robust and logical manner.  
Integration of data, recorded from a multiple sensor system, together with knowledge, is known as data 
fusion. Data fusion plays an important rule for damage assessment of structure using the vibration-based 
measurements. Thomopoulos [1] gives a discussion regarding the advantages of multiple-sensor systems over 
single-sensor systems. This discussion states that there are numerous advantages in using multiple sensor 
systems including: higher signal-to-noise ratio; information regarding independent features in the system can 
be obtained; increased dimensionality of the measurement; improved resolution, reduced uncertainty, and 
reduction in measurement time. With the concept of data fusion, to enhance the reliability of the results 
provided by the redundancy of the information, in this study, identical sensors are used within the 
multi-sensor system then the data analysis process can be done with minimal effort.  
   In developing data fusion technique for effective and logic damage detection algorithm, signal processing 
and computation ability are important elements in the implementation and operation. The overall chain of 
processing for a multi-sensor architecture included: data pre-procession, feature extraction and selection, 
pattern recognition and data fusion. As shown in Figure 1, two different types of data fusions can be defined: 
Centralized fusion (Figure 1a) and Pattern-level fusion (Figure 1b). In this study a simple centralized 
 28
measurement, and Yf is a LD×K matrix contains future measurement, and “D” is the number of measurement. 
The second step of SSI-COV is to evaluate the block Toeplitz matrix T from the future and past part of the 
data Hankel matrix as:

The Toeplitz matrix can be factorized into the extended observability matrix O  and the reversed extended 
stochastic controllability matrix Γ , as shown below:

                          (4) 
The observability matrix O and the controllability matrix  both contain system information which can be 
evaluated by taking the singular value decomposition (SVD) of Toeplitz matrix:  
TUSVT =                                       (5) 
Comparing Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), the matrix O and Γ can be derived by splitting the result from SVD into two 
parts as:  
                                     
0.5USO =                                        (6) 
                                     
T0.5VSΓ =                                       (7) 
From the observability matrix one can derive the system matrix A and the output matrix C. From the 
definition, the output matrix C is the first block of the observability matrix O as: 
]O[C :,:1 n=                                      (8) 
where n is number of measurement. System matrix A can be computed by exploiting the shift structure of the 
extended observability matrix O as:

where “ l” denotes the matrix pseudo-inverse. The system matrix A is extracted by taking advantage of the 
shift structure of matrix Oi, and the pseudo-inverse of Oi is to determine the system matrix A in a least square 
sense. The modal frequencies and effective damping ratios can be computed by conducting eigenvalue 
decomposition of the system matrix A, and the corresponding eigenvectors multiplied by the output matrix C 
are the observed mode shapes.  
2.2 Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (MSSA) 
Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (MSSA) is an extension of SSA [14,15]. It consists of the 
 30
4th Step: Diagonal Averaging 
After 3rd step, Hankel matrix is divided into several submatrices as shown in equation (1). Then original 
time series y can be divided into several elementary time series y1~yD as: 
D21 yyyy +++= L                             (16) 
where each elementary time series can be derived by diagonal averaging of each submatrix as: 
}.{. ii Yy ad=                                      (17) 
d.a.{.} denotes as diagonal averaging operator [14, 15]. 
3. DAMAGE INDICES DERIVED FROM CENTRALIZED DATA ANALYSIS  
   Follow the theory of SSI-COV and MSSA and the multisensory architecture five damage indices are 
proposed with the concept of centralized data analysis. 
3.1 Identify time-varying modal frequencies and mode shape slope ratios using SSI-COV 
In SSI-COV both system matrix A and C matrix can be identified. The modal frequencies and effective 
damping ratios are then computed by conducting eigenvalue decomposition of the system matrix A, and the 
corresponding eigenvectors multiplied by the output matrix C are the identified mode shapes. With the 
moving window technique the time-varying system modal frequencies can be identified. Besides, through the 
identified time-varying system mode shapes, the changes of mode shape slope ratio (in terms of spatial 
coordinate) can also be calculated which provide VBDD indices for locating the structural damage.   
To detect the damage location using SSI-COV, the rate of change of the mode shape slope is calculated. 
The mode shape slope ratio is defined as: 
 
where mi is the slope of the ith discrete segment of the mode shape. The result shows that th proposed slope 
ratio calculation can reflect the significant change of the slope change at any spatial coordinate.  
3.2 Damage Detection using Eigen-Ratio Difference from MSSA 
   Ratio of two singular values from MSSA, which quantifying coupling level between two singular 
values in singular spectrum analysis, can be used as an indicator of signal instability. It is an important feature 
of data series and may provide available information for structural health monitoring. In this study the 
coupling level between 1st and 2nd singular values in MSSA is used because these two singular values 
represent most significant principal components in the analyzed time series. The damage index is defined as 
the eigenvalue ratio difference (ERD) to quantify the coupling level between 1st and 2nd singular value [16]:

                                (18)  
Larger ERD indicates the coupling level between 1st and 2nd singular value is weak, therefore, damage 
situation at this particular window is more obvious than other time window with smaller ERD.  
3.3 Null-space and Subspace Damage Index   
From the procedure of MSSA, it is known that the data Hankel matrix involves some signal features 
 32
where “D” is the measurement points. Now take the SVD of H to obtain the singular value (Proper 
Orthogonal Value, POV) λi  ( i=1, 2, …, D) and eigenvector DxDR~ ∈U (Proper Orthogonal Mode, POM). By 
comparing the first few POM between the reference state and damage state damage situation can be identified. 
It is now defined the assurance criteria of the k-th POM as: 
  ))((, kTkT kref,T kref,
k
T
kref,
uuuu
uu
=kPOMMAC                             (23) 
where kref,u  and uk  are the k-th POM of the undamaged and damaged test structure, respectively. Smaller 
MAC value indicated the proper orthogonal mode of the current state is different from the reference 
(undamaged) state of the structure. 
3.6 Cross-correlation Function Amplitude Vector Assurance Criteria 
The normalized cross correlation function amplitude vector (CorV) of the responses of a structure is 
defined:

The correlation coefficient between the measurement locations )()( txandtx ik in a structure should be close 
to one if the structure is not damage. Otherwise, the correlation coefficient will be low if damage occurred in 
the structure. In order to identify and quantify such a damage that occurred in the structure the correlation 
between two CorV’s is defined [19]: 
5.05.0 )()( 00T

CorVCorVCorVCorV

=CVAC  & ]10,[∈CVAC                (26) 
where CorV0 and CorV indicated the correlation coefficient of two different state, one is the reference state 
and other is the damaged state (or data calculated from different time period to express the different situation 
to the reference state). Higher CVAC value indicates higher correlation between the two states. 
4. DAMAGE INDICES DERIVED FROM PATTERN-LEVEL DATA ANALYSIS 
    Instead of using the centralized data analysis, data collected from each sensing node can also analyzed in 
advance individually. Feature is extracted from each sensing signal and then combined all the features for a 
pattern recognition and decision, as shown in Figure 1b. Different from the centralized data analysis, two 
pattern-level data analysis are also introduced.   
4.1 Novelty Analysis of Time-Frequency Hilbert Amplitude Spectrum 
    The frequency-time domain analysis of each sensing data for each specific time window can also be 
developed. Apply the wavelet-package transform (WPT) together with Hilbert amplitude spectrum to each

where fa,i, ia,φ and fe,i, i,φe  are the i

and system identification result. Two separate objective functions were combined and defined for undamaged 
and damaged structure as follows: 
casedamagedorundamagedk;k,k,k =Π+Π=Π 21 βα              (31) 
where weighting factors α and β are taken as 1.0 in this study. The fundamental frequency and mode shape 
were selected for optimization. Through the result of modal updating, the accurate model parameter of the FE 
model can be estimated. Comparison on the identified model parameters between the undamaged and 
damaged state the information to quantify the damage can be determined..  
6. APPLICATION OF VBDD TO BRIDGE SCOURING TEST DATA 
In order to verify the VBDD algorithms an experimental test on a sequential damage phenomenon of 
bridge scouring effect is developed. A four span bridge model with simply supported girder on each pier was 
constructed to across a watercourse of width about 4.3 meters in the hydraulic lab. The bridge pier foundation 
is a hollow transparent acrylic tube with 1.5cm thickness intensified by steel plate on top and bottom of the 
tube and steel bar inside the tube. The total weight of each pier is about 25kg. The bridge deck is a steel plate 
with thickness 2cm. Two bridge decks of middle span are 47×100cm. Two side spans are 47×125cm. Their 
weight is 75kg and 100kg respectively. Simple rubber spacer with thickness 2mm and diameter 1.5cm is used 
as the bridge bearing between deck and pier. Sketch and dimension of this bridge model are shown in Figure 
2a. The bridge pier foundations are embedded in sand with depth of 30 cm. To focus major scouring 
phenomenon on one single bridge pier, major running stream water was guided and focuses scouring effect 
mainly on pier #3. Photos of bridge during and after the test are shown in Figure 2b. Total run time of this test 
is 180 minutes. Water flows to the bridge pier at about 5 minutes after the test starts, and flow condition is 
stable until about 30 minutes after the test starts. At about 100 minutes the pier #3 gradually displaces and 
descends resulting from scouring around the foundation of pier #3.  
   Twelve sensors are installed on the bridge deck to collect the bridge vibration signal in transverse 
direction (along stream line). The VSE-15D velocity-type sensor is used which is a servo velocity meter 
produced by Tokyo Sokushin Co., Ltd. This sensor is very sensitive to detect low level vibration motion and 
its linear range (0.2Hz~70Hz) which is suitable for structural health monitoring applications. It can be used to 
measure acceleration or velocity response and velocity response is measured in the test. Response data from 
the 12 velocity sensors are used for damage detection during the scouring test. To detect the damage from the 
non-stationary response data, moving window technique is used. A 40 sec. moving time window is used with 
20 sec. of overlap.  
   First, five damage indices from the concept of centralized data analysis are applied to this scouring test:  
(a) Use moving window SSI-COV to identify the time-varying system natural frequencies and changes of 
mode shape slope ratio. As shown in Figure 3a, the abrupt change of system natural frequencies were 
observed at time .min.t 095≈  which is in consistent with the abnormal signal recorded from sensing node 
#9 and the time when the settlement of the pier #3 occured. The mode shape slope change was also identified 
 36
on the identification of damage occurrence (Level-1), damage location (Level-2) and damage quantification 
(Level-3) is made. The computation efficiency among different damage detection algorithm is also presented, 
as shown in Table 1. It is concluded that for most of the proposed damage detection method it is easy to 
identify the damage occurrence. To estimate the damage location, generally, a reference state (undamaged 
state) needs to be defined in advance and it may need more computation time to estimate the damage location, 
as shown in Table 1. Finally, to quantify the damage a simple finite element model is developed and the 
modal updating will be used to identify the key parameters of the model. It is important to note that to use a 
sophisticate FE model which can reflect the significant damage modes is more realistic to use a complicated 
FE model to quantify the damage. In this study both centralized and pattern-level feature extradition methods 
can be embedded in smart sensing system and through moving window technique one can present the results 
in an almost real-time early warning on damage detection.。
