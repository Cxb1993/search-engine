I. 前言  Introduction 
The well-organized fibrous tissues in ligaments are mainly composed of parallel collagen fibers that are 
aligned along the longitudinal direction of the ligament and contribute to the mechanical strength of the tissue 
[1].  Upon injury, the healing response involves ligament fibroblasts synthesizing matrix molecules at the 
wound site to restore its structure.  However, the newly synthesized matrix is often poorly organized, 
resulting in impaired functional properties of the tissue [2-3].  To address this issue, directed cell alignment 
and resulting collagen fiber organization would be desirable to restore tissue mechanics and functionality. 
Electrical stimulation is used clinically for the treatment of fracture nonunions and spinal fusions [4-5] and 
has been shown to improve lapine and rat ligament healing [6-8].  We previously demonstrated that applied 
direct current (DC) electric fields (EF) enhance cultured ligament fibroblast migration, alignment, and 
collagen synthesis on two-dimensional (2D) substrates [9].  Furthermore, ligament fibroblast orientation can 
determine the alignment of the cell-produced collagenous matrix [10]. 
 
II. 研究目的  Specific Aims 
To examine the effects of applied EF in a three-dimensional (3D) environment and how cells remodel the 
ECM, we proposed the novel methodology to stimulate ligament fibroblast biosynthesis and matrix 
organization for improved ligament healing via applied DC EF based on the following specific aims (SA): 
 
SA1 Characterize ligament fibroblast orientation responses with applied EF in a collagen hydrogel.  
SA2 Establish long-term cultures of ligament-hydrogel constructs that are compatible with EF 
application.   
SA3 Establish ligament explant cultures with hydrogel as an interfacing material at the wound site.  
 
This grant proposal first aimed to characterize and optimize ligament fibroblast responses to applied EF in 3D 
collagen hydrogel.  Subsequently, in situ explant models were utilized to study the ligament tissue response 
to applied EF.  
 
III. 文獻探討  Background 
A Electric Fields 
EFs can play a significant role in modulating cellular behaviors.  An electrical gradient of 1-5 V/cm has been 
found in embryonic tissue and wound sites to promote cell migration [11-13].  In cultured cells, it is 
hypothesized that the electric fields creates an electro-osmosis force to recruit membrane proteins to polarize, 
causing directed migration [14-16].  Studies in embryonic development have found disruption of this 
gradient result in failed development [17-18].  Electrical stimulation has been long used in orthopaedic 
practices to promote healing in bone fractures and chronic non-unions (e.g. [4, 19-20]).  While the 
mechanisms of healing by EFs are mostly unknown, pulsed electric fields are observed to be osteogenic, 
affecting differentiation and local factor production [21].  Several studies revealed that applied EFs stimulate 
cell proliferation, differentiation, as well as synthesis of growth factors and matrix proteins [23-24].  The 
potential of electrical stimulation for soft tissues has also been explored.  Lippielo et al demonstrated that an 
applied pulsing current EF enhances the repair of osteochondral defects and ligament injuries [6-8].

A.3 Discussion 
Studies have examined the interaction between directed cell migration and substrate topography (e.g. [28, 38]).  
We expand into 3D configuration by utilizing a microfluidic system to create a cell-compatible collagen 
hydrogel.  In the 2D system, both applied EF and fiber alignment enhanced cell migration speed and these 
factors act synergistically on directed cell migration.  In the 3D configuration, however, both applied EF and 
fiber alignment are required to result in increased cell migration, while fiber orientation alone is not a factor 
(Figure IV-1B).  Interestingly, contrary to previous studies, no significant effect on cell orientation or 
elongation was found ([28]).  As the native matrix are often highly organized whereas the healing 
provisional matrix are amorphous, the current study provide a new insight into the role of EF on wound 
healing as well as its possible applications. 
 
B Electrical Stimulation Waveforms from Physical Therapy Stimulate ACL Fibroblast Migration  [Accepted as 
a short-talk presentation at the ORS 2011 Annual Meeting] 
B.1 Introduction 
Numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the healing capability of the ACL.  Electrical 
stimulation is widely used for the treatment of pain and to promote wound healing [39].  In orthopaedic 
practices, applied electric fields (EFs) have been used clinically to promote bone healing [40].  EF has also 
been shown to improve lapine ligament repair in vivo [6].  In the current study, several stimulation 
waveforms used in physical therapy for promoting tissue repair were adapted to examine their effects on ACL 
fibroblast migration and morphology.  
B.2 Methods 
ACLs were harvested from porcine knee joints and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS.  A customized 
electrical stimulation chamber as used as previously described [9].  Constant DC EF was applied at either 30 
V or 0.19 V across the chamber using a Keithley SourceMeter.  Other waveforms that were applied using a 
custom stimulator (Dynaprog, MingQuo) are illustrated in Figure IV-2.  All waveforms and the constant 0.19 
V group have the same amount of total current flow (37.58 As).  Faradic current (Far) represents a 
graduation series of triangular waves peaking at 2.8 V at 50 Hz.  High-voltage pulsed galvanic stimulation

C.2 Methods 
Porcine ACLs were harvested within 24 hours of death from the local butcher.  Each ligament was cleaned 
and separated into sections.  Collagen hydrogels were made using type I collagen solution that was 
neutralized to a final concentration of 4 mg/mL.  Ligament sections were placed in the center of a custom 
PDMS mold filled with 1 mL of the collagen hydrogel (Figure IV-3A).  After overnight incubation, the 
ligament constructs were placed in a customized EF chamber (Figure IV-3B) and subjected to 1 hour of 
applied EF at 0.1 V/cm for 4 days.  
C.3 Results 
Cell infiltration into the 
provisional collagen matrix 
was recorded daily using an 
inverted tissue culture 
microscope and was evident 
after 3 days of culture 
without applied EF.  After 
7 days of culture, cells have 
clearly migrated into the 
surrounding matrix at the 
ends and the sides of 
ligament sections (Figure 
IV-3C&D).  Insert of the 
figure also demonstrated 
integration between the 
ligament matrix and 
collagen hydrogel. 
C.4 Discussion 
This preliminary data demonstrated our ability to create long-term cultures of ligament-hydrogel constructs 
that are compatible with EF application.  This system will serve as the prototype for the in vitro 
wound-healing system.  Further studies will investigate different EF parameters as well as the effects of 
soluble factor supplementations (such as PRP) on cell migration and organization of the provisional matrix.

Introduction 
Numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the healing 
capability of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).  Electrical 
stimulation is widely used for the treatment of pain and to promote 
wound healing [1].  In orthopaedic practices, applied electric fields (EFs) 
have been used clinically to promote bone healing [2].  EF has also been 
shown to improve lapine ligament repair in vivo [3].  We have 
previously demonstrated that applied EF enhanced ligament fibroblast 
migration and collagen production, depending on the applied EF 
parameters [4].  In the current study, several stimulation waveforms used 
in physical therapy for promoting tissue repair were adapted to examine 
their effects on ACL fibroblast migration and morphology.  
 
Materials and Methods 
Cell Culture:  Porcine ACLs were harvested within 24 hours of death 
and fibroblasts were collected from explant cultures.  The explant and 
cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen).  
Prior to experiments, the ACL fibroblasts were trypsinized and seeded 
on glass slides at 2x105 cells/cm2 for 2 hours. 
EF Stimulation:  A customized electrical stimulation chamber as used as 
previously described [4].  Constant direct current (DC) EF was applied 
at either 30 V or 0.19 V across the chamber using a Keithley 
SourceMeter.  Other waveforms that were applied using a custom 
stimulator (Dynaprog, MingQuo, Taiwan) are illustrated in Figure 1.  All 
waveforms and the constant 0.19 V group were controlled to have the 
same amount of total current flow (37.58As).  Faradic current (Far) 
represents a graduation series of triangular waves peaking at 2.8 V at 50 
Hz.  High-voltage pulsed galvanic stimulation (HVPGS) consists of 
monophasic, twin-spike pulses that have a fixed pulse duration of 100 s 
and max intensity at 300 V with a frequency of 2 Hz.  Sinusoidal waves 
(sin) have a peak intensity of 60 V at 50 Hz and the diadynamic waves 
(diadyn) are rectified monophasicc sinusoidal waves.  
Outcome Measures:  Images were taken every 15 minutes during the 
one-hour stimulation and cell migration speed and directionality were 
analyzed from the displacement of the centroid locations of each cell.  
Directional velocity represents cell migration speed in the direction of 
the applied field.  Cell morphology was analyzed by manually tracing 
the major and minor axises of the cell to find the aspect ratio. 
Statistics:  Statistical analysis were performed using Statistica (=0.05, 
StatSoft).

Result 
Under electrical stimulation, ACL fibroblasts exhibited significantly 
different responses in migration and orientation (Figure 2).  All groups 
except for the HVPGS group exhibited enhanced migration speed.  
When compared with the groups subjected to constant DC EFs, all the 
other groups were slower except for the diadynamic group.  In terms of 
directional velocity, interestingly, no directionality was found with the 
constant 0.19 V EF group even though it has similarly enhanced 
migration speed with the 30 V group.  Morphological examination 
revealed differential cell shape responses.  In the constant 30 V group, 
ACL fibroblasts exhibited significant elongation and aligned 
perpendicular to the constant applied EF groups (Figure 3).  All other 
groups did not exhibit any significant elongation or orientation.

Discussion 
We investigated the effects of physical therapy electrical stimulation on 
ligament cell migration and morphology.  Most of the waveforms we 
tested resulted in enhanced fibroblast migration speed, while their 
effects on cell migration directionality were noticeably different.  As we 
have previously shown, bovine ACL fibroblast and chondrocytes both 
exhibit different EF threshold response in motility and directionality [4-
5].  Furthermore, ACL fibroblast exhibit frequency dependent migration 
behaviors [4].  Using different waveform and field strengths, we 
discovered a decoupling of cell shape and directionality, which may 
suggest disparate mechanisms in the two responses [6].  In the current 
study, faradic and diadynamic stimulation promoted the most significant 
response in both speed and directionality.  Faradic stimulation has been 
shown to promote collagen organization while diadynamic stimulation 
promotes skin wound healing [7-8].  Interestingly, while HVPGS has 
been demonstrated to increase proliferation, collagen synthesis and skin 
wound healing, no significant effect of increased cell migration is shown 
here [9].  Future studies will examine the effects of electrical stimulation 
on both intra- and extra- cellular polarization as well as biosynthesis and 
proliferation.

與骨外科醫學年會(AAOS)分割，值得期待。 
二、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
無 
三、建議 
國科會規定不補助學會的年費，但許多會議的報名費都會因為是會員而有所折扣，甚或是總額與
非會員相同。基於鼓勵國內研究學者出國開會發表的精神，建議補助學會的年費；若擔心浮報，
可只補助該年有出席學會會議的年費，如此差額應該不大，也可鼓勵學者參加國際組織。
