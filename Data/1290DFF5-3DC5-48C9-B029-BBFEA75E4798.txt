1. Abstract
The porous nickel hydroxide films coated with
transition metals such as nickel and cobalt were
fabricated directly by electrophoretic deposition
(EPD) in the presence of charging additives (nickel
nitrate and cobalt nitrate). The zeta potential of
nickel hydroxide suspension is affected with the
charging additive. The nickel hydroxide particle of
weakly and negatively charged surface in
isopropanol solution handicaps EPD and dispersion.
When adding the charging additive to the suspension,
the adsorption of dissolved metal ions on nickel
hydroxide results in more positively charged surface
of particles for facilitating the EPD and dispersion.
When nickel hydroxide particle arrives at the
negative electrode during the EPD process, metal
ions adsorbed on the particle are reduced
electrochemically to form metal layer. The
as-deposited nickel hydroxide films convert to
nickel oxide after heat treatment at 300oC. Results
revealed that the nickel oxide films coated with
nickel and cobalt have better capacitive behavior
than the bare film. The improved capacitive
behavior can be attributed to the co-deposition of
transition metal which can act as a conducting
binder to electrically connect the nickel oxide
nanoparticles and substrate.
Keywords: electrophoretic deposition, nickel
oxide film, charging additive, zeta potential, and
electrochemical capacitors.
2. Introduction
The capacitors, which can be categorized into
electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and
electrochemical capacitor (supercapacitor), have the
advantages of high power density and long cycle-life
compared to batteries. The electrochemical capacitor
can store much more capacitance through the
Faradaic reaction. Therefore, much of the research
effort in capacitors over the past decade has been
focused on the electrochemical capacitor. Electrode
materials like metal oxides have been demonstrated
to be qualified for use in the electrochemical
capacitor [1]. Metal oxides such as ruthenium oxide,
manganese oxide, cobalt oxide, iron oxide, and
nickel oxide have received much research attention
owing to their high specific capacitance compared to
carbon-based materials [1]. Most of the nickel oxide
materials are prepared by thermal treatment of the
nickel hydroxides for electrochemical capacitor
applications. Several methods such as sputtering [2],
electrospinning [3], dip coating [4,5], slurry coating
[6-9], co-casting [10], electrochemical deposition
[11-22], and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) [23]
have been reported to be the manufacturing
processes in the electrode fabrication for nickel
oxide capacitor. Among these methods, EPD
technique has turned out to be a reliable method for
fabricating thin films of functional materials on
various substrates [24-26]. Recently, the high-power
density capacitor electrodes of carbon nanotube
films prepared by EPD have been reported [27,28].
Also, EPD of hydrous ruthenium oxides and their
capacitive performances have been investigated
systematically as a high-power capacitor [29,30]. Li
et al. indicated that EPD is a possible method for the
fabrication of manganese oxide electrodes for
electrochemical capacitors [31]. The use of polymer
4coated on the SS substrate uniformly due to the
well-dispersed nickel oxide nanoparticles in
suspension containing charging additive. This
finding suggests that the more positively charged
nickel oxide surface resulting from the adsorption of
metal ions may considerably enhance the stability of
nickel oxide suspension.
The capacitive behavior of nickel oxide films is
characterized by means of cyclic voltammogram
(CV) in 0.5 M KOH solution. Fig. 3 shows the CVs
of nickel oxide films deposited in the presence of
iodine, nickel nitrate, and cobalt nitrate, respectively.
At a low scan rate of 10 mV s-1 shown in Fig. 3a, a
nickel oxide film deposited in the presence of iodine
additive (denoted as bare film) shows a roughly
rectangular mirror image with respect to the
zero-current line, which represents an EDLC
behavior of film. When the nickel oxide films are
coated with nickel and cobalt composites, the CVs
correspond to the Faradaic capacitor due to the
appearance of redox peaks. The redox peaks result
from the electrochemical reactions between NiO and
NiOOH. Clearly, the oxidation and reduction peaks
of nickel oxide film coated with nickel were
observed at 0.437 V and 0.358 V, respectively. These
two peaks were shifted to less positive potentials
(0.402 V and 0.318 V for oxidation and reduction,
respectively) for a film coated with cobalt. In CV
curves, another oxidation peak appears beyond the
oxidation peak of NiO/NiOOH, which is the oxygen
evolution reaction. For a bare nickel oxide film,
these two oxidation peaks merge together. One
noteworthy point is that the potential difference
between these two reactions (NiO/NiOOH and
oxygen evolution) for a nickel oxide film coated
with nickel is much larger than that of a bare film.
One can see that similar but even larger potential
difference exists for a nickel oxide film coated with
cobalt. Ovshinsy et al. [35] pointed out that the
function of cobalt oxide in the nickel oxide electrode
is to mitigate the oxygen evolution reaction, thus a
higher charging efficiency could be obtained. At a
higher scan rate of 50 mVs-1 shown in Fig. 3b, two
oxidation peaks for a film coated with cobalt remain
distinguishable, while those for a film coated with
nickel begin to converge. This means that a film
coated with cobalt exhibits better charging efficiency
than a film coated with nickel at high rate charging.
Fig. 4 shows the specific capacitances of the
nickel oxide films measured at various scan rates.
The films were deposited in the presence of iodine,
nickel nitrate, and cobalt nitrate, respectively. The
specific capacitance (C) of films is calculated by
dividing half the integrated area of the CV curve by
the scan rate to obtain the charge (Q) and by
subsequently dividing Q by the width of the
potential window (V) [36,37]

where i is the current density (A g-1), V is the
potential window (V), V is the applied potential (V),
and v is the scan rate (V s-1).
As illustrated in Fig. 4, all films have higher
specific capacitance at low scan rate than those at
high scan rate. The bare nickel oxide film (prepared
in the presence of iodine) has a specific capacitance
of 138 F g-1 at a low scan rate of 10 mV s-1, and the
value reduces to 117 F g-1 at a high scan rate of 200
mV s-1. The nickel oxide films coated with nickel
and cobalt exhibit higher specific capacitance than
the bare film even at higher scan rates. This finding
suggests that nickel oxide films coated with nickel
and cobalt may have a large electroactive area on the
surface layer of the nickel oxide nanoparticles for
high rate charging and discharging. A small decrease
in specific capacitance with increasing the scan rate
also reflects the high power characteristics of nickel
oxide films coated with transition metal oxide. The
calculated specific capacitance of nickel oxide films
coated with nickel and cobalt at a scan rate of 10 mV
s-1 reaches about 180 F g-1, which is 1.3 times higher
than that of the bare film (138 F g-1). The high
6nickel hydroxide suspension can be affected by the
concentration and type of charging additive (nitrate
salt). An appropriate amount of nitrate salt favors the
zeta potential due to the adsorption of metal ions on
nickel hydroxide particles. The excessive amount of
nitrate salt in the suspension is detrimental to zeta
potential due to the increased ionic strength. The
optimal zeta potentials for nickel nitrate and cobalt
nitrate additives are found to be about 30 mV and 25
mV at concentrations of 0.62 mM and 0.83 mM,
respectively. During the EPD process, when nickel
hydroxide particle arrives at the substrate, metal ions
adsorbed on the particle surface are reduced
electrochemically to form metal layer. This metal
layer serves as a conducting binder to prevent the
detachment of nickel oxide particles from the film
surface during charging and discharging. In addition,
the electron conducting resistance and the
charge-transfer resistance of film can be alleviated
significantly by the metal layer. Therefore, the
electrochemical performance of nickel oxide film
can be significantly enhanced by the EPD process in
presence of the nitrate salt. The specific capacitances
of nickel oxide film coated with metals are much
higher than that of a bare film in all scan rates.
Possibly, the conducting metal composite offers
large surface area for fast charge storage and redox
reactions and is capable of delivering high power.
The nickel oxide films coated with conducting
nickel and cobalt exhibit high capacity and stable
capacity retention during galvanostatic cycling, and
therefore are suitable for long-time applications in
KOH solution.
