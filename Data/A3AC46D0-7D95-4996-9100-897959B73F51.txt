1 Introduction
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising modulation technique for the fourth-
generation (4G) high speed broadband communication systems because of its high data rate, high spectral
efficiency, and prevention of intersymbol interference (ISI) [1, 2]. OFDM is standardized as the European dig-
ital audio/vedio broadcast (DAB/ DVB) schemes, IEEE 802.11a/g/n, IEEE 802.16a, and high-performance
local area network (HiperLan) [3, 4]. The operational principle of OFDM is that the original bandwidth,
due to inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) and cyclic prefix (CP) insertion, is divided into a high
number of narrow sub-bands, in which the mobile channel can be considered non-dispersive [4]. Then a low
complexity equalization at the receiver can be easily implemented by a set of complex multipliers, one for
each sub-band, provided the channel state information is available [15].
However, one of the weaknesses of OFDM systems is lack of multipath diversity. As each symbol is
transmitted via a single flat channel, if the corresponding channel is in deep fade, the symbol will be
corrupted [15]. To combat this problem, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, enabled by
employing multiple transmit and receive antennas, has been proposed to increase multipath diversity [5].
In addition, such technology also increases significantly the channel capacity [5]. Hence, MIMO-OFDM
systems, which combine OFDM and MIMO technologies, can provide a high performance transmission [5].
To exploit the benefit of MIMO-OFDM systems, channel state information is required at the receiver.
Channel can be estimated using training signal which requires additional bandwidth [6]-[8]. As a means to
eschewing the need of training signal and the associated bandwidth requirement, blind channel estimation
for MIMO-OFDM systems has been an active area of research in recent years . Bolcskei et al. [9] proposed a
method for blind channel estimation for MIMO-OFDM systems using non-constant modulus periodic precod-
ing. The method imposes no restriction on channel zeros and is insensitivity to channel order overestimation.
However, no systematic procedure for the design of the periodic precoder is given. Yatawatta and Petropulu
[11] proposed a non-redundant block precoding scheme for MIMO-OFDM systems. They use the precoding
to spread the symbols of each user over all subcarriers, thus increasing multipath diversity to reduce bit error
rate (BER) at the receivers. Gao and Nallananathan [10] developed a subspace based approach to identify
the MIMO-OFDM systems using nonredundant linear precoding. A distinguishing feature of the method is
that it can be applied for the scenarios where the number of transmitters is less than that of the receivers.
Gao et al. [12] also proposed a non-precoding based robust subspace method for MIMO-OFDM systems
by taking advantage of an appropriate remodulation on the received signal blocks. The proposed method
exhibits many advantages such as robustness to channel order overestimation and capability of guaranteeing
the channel identifiability. However, the method requires substantially more computations. Shin et al. [13]
presented a new blind channel estimator based on noise subspace method. A feature of this paper is that it
can work regardless of the presence of virtual carriers. In [14], Wan et al. proposed a linear prediction based

Consider aK-input J-output discrete time OFDM baseband system shown in Figure 1. Let {hjk(0) hjk(1)
· · · hjk(Ljk)} be the impulse response from the kth transmitter to the jth receiver with order Ljk, and
L = maxj,k{Ljk} is the order of the MIMO channel. At the kth transmitter, k = 1, 2, · · · ,K, the nth infor-
mation vector x(k)(n) = [x(k)1 (n) x
(k)
2 (n) · · · x(k)M (n)]T ∈ CM is first precoded by a real circular precoder
P ∈ RM×M , followed by an IDFT matrix F−1, to obtain
s(k)(n) = F−1Px(k)(n) (2.1)
where s(k)(n) = [s(k)1 (n) s
(k)
2 (n) · · · s(k)M (n)]T ∈ CM and P is a circulant matrix with [p1 p2 · · · pM ]T as
its first column and pi ≥ 0, ∀i. Then after cyclic prefix (CP) insertion at each of the transmitted vector
s(k)(n) and CP removal at the received end, as long as the length of CP is greater than or equal to L, the
input-output relation of the system can be described as follows:

(2.2)
where z(j)(n) = [z(j)1 (n) z

2 (n) · · · z(j)M (n)]T ∈ CM and w(j)(n) = [w(j)1 (n) w(j)2 (n) · · · w(j)M (n)]T ∈ CM
are the received signal and the noise signal, respectively, ∀j = 1, 2, · · · , J . Hjk ∈ CM×M is a circulant
matrix with [hjk(0) hjk(1) · · · hjk(L) 0 · · · 0]T ∈ CM being its first column. Taking DFT operation of
the received signal data z(j)(n) and using (2.1), we obtain the following equations from (2.2).

where for j = 1, 2, · · · , J , v(j)(n) = Fw(j)(n) = [v(j)1 (n) v(j)2 (n) · · · v(j)M (n)]T ∈ CM is the noise vector,

for m = 1, 2, · · · ,M and ω = exp(i2pi/M).
To further simplify the system model, we re-group the transmitted and received signals as follows:

(3.3)
Then from the correlation matrix R in (3.3), we can obtain the frequency-domain channel product matrices
D(k)D(l)∗ by dividing each submatrix in R by the corresponding gm, 1 ≤ k, l,m ≤M . Then the frequency-
domain channel product matrices are used to form a Hermitian matrix QF = DFD∗F ∈ CJM×JM , which
is the outer product of the channel coefficient matrix DF = [D(1)T D(2)T · · · D(M)T ]T ∈ CJM×K in
frequency domain. In theory, we can take eigen-decomposition of this outer-product matrix QF to obatin
an estimate D̂F of DF . However, taking eigen-decomposition of such a large size (JM × JM) of matrix
QF involves more computations and usually renders a less accurate result, especially when M is large. To
avoid this drawback, we want to form another Hermitian matrix QH = HH∗, which is the outer product
of the channel coefficient matrix H = [H(1)T H(2)T · · · H(L)T ]T ∈ CJ(L+1)×K in time domain. It is
obvious that the size of QH is J(L + 1) × J(L + 1), which is smaller that the size of QF . Hence taking
eigen-decomposition of QH to obtain an estimate Ĥ of H requires less computational load. To obtain QH ,
we first define an M × (L+ 1) matrix F1 = F(:, 1 : L+ 1), which is the matrix containing the first (L+ 1)
columns of F. In addition, we know the relation of the channel matrix in frequency domain and time domain
can be described as follows:
DF =
√
M(F1 ⊗ IJ)H. (3.4)
Then using (3.4) and QF obtained from (3.3), we obtain QH as follows:
QH = HH∗ =
1
M
(F∗1 ⊗ IJ)DFD∗F (F1 ⊗ IJ) =
1
M
(F∗1 ⊗ IJ)QF (F1 ⊗ IJ) (3.5)
Since rank(H) = K by assumption (ii), we know the Hermitian matrix QH is positive semi-definite
with K positive eigenvalues and the associated unit-norm eigenvectors, say, λ1, · · · , λK and d1, · · · ,dK ,
respectively. We can thus choose the channel impulse response matrix in time domain to be
Ĥ = [

Now we discuss the impact of τ on channel estimation and equalization. It is obvious that if τ = 0,
then the precoding coefficients (3.9) becomes (3.8), which is the optimal values for channel estimation since
in this case, the cost function g = (p1 + p2 + · · · + pM )2 reaches its maximum value. If τ increases from
0 to M−1M , then it is easy to check that g decreases, which means the estimation performance deteriorates.
On the other hand, if τ increases from 0 to M−1M , then from (3.9) and (3.10), we know each transmitted
symbol x(k)i (n) in the ith entry of Px
(k)(n) can be more highlighted, which would be beneficial to channel
equalization. Hence there is a tradeoff on the selection of τ between channel estimation and equalization.
We will give a simulation example to demonstrate this tradeoff in Section 4.
3.3 The Noisy Case
When noise is present, the correlation matrix R contains the contribution of noise. Thus (3.1) becomes
R = D(PP∗ ⊗ IK)D∗ + σ2wIJM (3.11)
From (3.3) and (3.11), we see that the noise has only contribution to the main diagonal entries of R. Thus
QF obtained from (3.3) becomes QF = DFD∗F + σ
2
wIJM , which results in a noise-contained matrix QH
shown as follows:
QH = 1M (F
∗
1 ⊗ IJ)(DFD∗F + σ2wIJM )(F1 ⊗ IJ)
= 1M (F
∗
1 ⊗ IJ)DFD∗F (F1 ⊗ IJ) + 1M (F∗1 ⊗ IJ)σ2wIJM (F1 ⊗ IJ)
= HH∗ + σ
2
w
M IJ(L+1)
(3.12)
Since the matrix H ∈ CJ(L+1)×K is of full column rank, the rank of HH∗ is K. This imples that the
assoicated smallest J(L + 1) − K eigenvalues of QH in (3.12) are equal to the scaled-noise variances σ
2
w
M .
Hence, in practice we can obtain the estimated scaled-noise variance as the average of the smallest J(L+1)−K
eigenvalues of QH . Then the outer-product matrix HH∗ can directly abtained by substracting
σ2w
M IJ(L+1)
from QH , and thus the channel impulse response matrix H can be obtained by taking eigen-decomposition
of HH∗, just like the discussion at the end of Section 3.1.
3.4 Discussion
1) Channel identifiability: For the proposed method, the channel identifiability condition is assumption
(ii), i.e., rank(H) = K. Hence the channel needs not be irreducible or column reduced [7], which is required
in some outer product methods [7, 8, 22].

by the least squares method [22]. The number of symbol blocks is S = 100. The input source symbols are
i.i.d. QPSK signals. The SNR at the output is defined as SNR = E[‖x(n)−w(n)‖
2
2]
E[‖w(n)‖22] . The channel noise is zero
mean, temporally and spatially white Gaussian.
Simulation 1 – the effect of the precoding on estimation and equalization
In experiment 1, we use 4 different precoders based on (3.9) with τ = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, to illustrate the
effect of the precoding on channel estimation and equalization. Figure 4.1(a) shows that NMSE decreases
as SNR increases for every precoder. In this figure, we also see that the estimation performs better for
smaller τ , which is consistent with our analysis in Section 3.2. Figure 4.1(b) shows that the symbol error
rate improves as τ increases since from (3.10), we know for a larger τ , each transmitted symbol in Px(k)(n)
can be more highlighted, which is more beneficial to symbol detection at the receiver. Figure 4.2 shows that
there is a tradeoff between estimation accuracy and equalization.
Simulation 2 – robustness to channel order overestimation
In this simulation, we use the precoding scheme that satisfy (3.9) with different τ and fix SNR= 10
dB. For each upper bound Lˆ, 0 ≤ (Lˆ − L) ≤ 5, we choose P = Lˆ and M = 9P for simulation such that
the transmission efficiency is maintained at 90%. Figure 4.2 shows that the proposed method is robust to
channel order overestimation since the NMSE increases slowly for each τ as (Lˆ− L) increases from 0 to 5.
Simulation 3 – Channels with more transmitters than receivers
In this simulation, we generate 100 3-input 2-output random channels to illustrate the performance of
the proposed method for channel with more transmitters than receivers. The precoding scheme is chosen
based on (3.9) with different τ . Figure 4.3 shows that the NMSE decreases as SNR increases. It also shows
that the proposed method can apply to the channels with more transmitters than receivers.

5 Conclusions
In this report, we propose a blind channel estimation method for MIMO-OFDM systems. By taking
advantage of circular precoding, we obtain the channel product matrices from the correlation matrix of the
received data. Then the channel impulse response matrix is obtained by computing the positive eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix formed from the channel product matrices. We also propose a
precoding scheme to minimizes the numerical error in correlation matrix estimation, and discuss the impact
of precoding on channel estimation and equalization. With the proposed framework, the method is shown
to be robust with respect to channel order overestimation and the identifiability condition is simply that the
channel impulse response matrix has full column rank. Thanks to the identifiability condition, the method is
applicable to MIMO channels with more transmitters or more receivers. Simulations are used to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed method.
Appendix
A Proof of The Circulant Structure of G
Since P is a circulant matrix, P can be written as F−1DpF, where Dp is a diagonal matrix. Then we
express G as follows.
G = PP∗
= F−1DpFF−1D∗pF
= F−1DpD∗pF
= F−1DgF
(A.1)
where Dg = DpD∗p is a diagonal matrix. Hence from (A.1), we know G is a circulant matrix.
