Abstract 
 
This project aims on the self-assembly behavior of semiflexible polymers bearing specific 
interaction groups to form special aggregates or supramolecular assemblies with themselves or 
other macromolecules with complementary binding groups. The systems under study include (1) 
DNA (bearing anionic phosphate groups) capable of forming electrostatic complexes with 
cationic dendrimers for mimicking DNA-histone complexes and for applications as non-viral 
vectors for gene therapy, and (2) semiflexible conjugated polymers (bearing pi-pi interaction 
groups) for opto-electronic applications. Experimental techniques including small angle X-ray 
and neutron scatterings (SAXS and SANS), TEM and AFM have been utilized for the structure 
characterizations. Multi-scale computer simulation scheme has been developed where for 
different length and time scales different methods have been used. This scheme will be used to

Preface 
According to the conformational degree of freedom, polymers can be categorized into flexible, 
semiflexible and rigid-rod chains.  Chain flexibility has a large impact on the structure of the 
polymers in condensed state and hence greatly influences their properties. In addition to chain 
stiffness, the introduction of specific interactions into polymers may also exert strong influences 
on the intermolecular packing and hence the structures/properties of the materials.  Under 
appropriate conditions, polymers bearing specific interaction sites/groups may undergo 
interesting and complex self-assemblies governed by the delicate balance between the energy 
associated with the specific interactions and the entropy loss relevant to the conformational and 
translational degree of freedom of the chains.  The structures of the resultant supramolecular 
aggregates are expected to be strongly influenced by the chain stiffness. Consequently, 
systematic manipulations of the interplay between chain stiffness and specific interactions may 
offer an effective strategy for creating novel self-assembled nanostructures for the production of 
functional materials for applications in optoelectronics, biomedicines, etc.  
 
This project presents a comprehensive study, combining experimental works and theoretical 
and simulation studies, on the self-assembly behavior of semiflexible polymers bearing specific 
interaction groups to form special aggregates or supramolecular assemblies with themselves or 
with other macromolecules bearing complementary binding groups. The systems of particular 
interest are (1) DNA (containing anionic phosphate groups) capable of forming electrostatic 
complexes with cationic dendrimers for mimicking DNA-histone complexes and for 
applications as non-viral vectors for gene therapy, and (2) semiflexible conjugated polymers 
(bearing -interaction groups) for opto-electronic applications.  Both conjugated polymers 
and DNA are semiflexible macromolecules and both of them show up a quite specific 
interactions. Specific interactions in conjugated polymers are the interactions of -electrons 
associated with double bonds and leading to formation of columns of benzene rings 
(-stacking). Specific interactions in DNA/dendrimers systems are of another type – these are 
long-ranged Coulomb interactions.  
 
This project aims at a comprehensive study of structure formation of DNA/dendrimer 
complexes and conjugated polymers in solution state, combining experiments, theory, and 
computer simulation methods.  For the complexes of DNA with dendrimer, the condensed 
structures of the complexes in aqueous media are being systematically investigated as a function 
of dendrimer generation number, charge ratio, charge density of the dendrimer and salt 
concentration. Differences and similarity between the structures of the complexes and the 
6 
important for controlling the properties of these materials for applications in opto-electronic and 
biomedical fields.  
 
Main results obtained during the 3-rd (last) year of the project 
NTHU group has used small-angle X-ray scattering experiments to investigate nanostructures 
formed by complexes of DNA with PAMAM dendrimer of low (second and third) and 
intermediate (fourth) generations. The experimental phase diagrams (morphological maps) in 
the variables "charge density of the dendrimer - molar ratio of amine groups of the dendrimer to 
the phosphate groups of DNA" have been constructed. It turned out that these phase diagrams 
(diagrams of state) differ substantially from each other in the case of DNA complexes with 
dendrimers of the second and the third generation. For the second generation dendrimer the 
diagram of states consists of three different morphologies of columnar hexagonal phasees with 
different distances between the cylinders, formed by complexes of DNA with dendrimers. And 
for the third generation dendrimer the diagram of states consists of one morphology of columnar 
hexagonal phase, formed by complexes of DNA with dendrimers, and it also has three different 
morphologies of the tetragonal columnar phases with different distances between the cylinders. 
Another important experimental achievement of NTHU group is a technique to identify the 
mechanism of aggregation of molecules of conjugated polymers (polyfluorene) in aromatic 
solvents (toluene) using NMR spectroscopy. The presence of toluene molecules inside the 
pi-pi-complexes formed by segments of polyfluorene molecules was detected on NMR spectra. 
A very interesting effect of stabilizing the aggregation of molecules of conjugated polymer in an 
aromatic solvent (in a very dilute solution) was discovered which is due to the formation of 
more stable pi-pi links between the benzene rings of the polymer molecules in the presence of 
toluene, whereas in an aliphatic solvent (tetrahydrofuran) the aggregation of polyfluorene was 
not observed. This effect is a rare example of a violation of the principle "the like dissolves in 
the like."  
The MSU team has performed studies of these polymer systems using computer modeling, 
developing a full multi-scale modeling scheme. At the stages of the quantum-chemical 
calculations, atomistic molecular dynamics simulation and coarse-graining simulation using the 
molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods a significant progress has been achieved. More 
specifically, it was possible not only to perform calculations on these three independent levels of 
detail models, but also to achieve some success in conjugation of these levels with each other. 
For systems of conjugated polymers the numerical coefficients in several additional terms in 
atomistic interaction potential (force field) have been calculated, which are absent in the 
standard force fields (such as OPLS). Using atomistic molecular dynamics with this force field 
for a few specially chosen system of conjugated polymers in different solvents, we have 
8 
shown that if the system consists of a large number of linear chains and dendrimers, they first 
gather in pairs, and then form a single complex. The structure factor of the system of eight 9-th 
generation dendrimer and eight linear chains is in good agreement with experiment. Despite the 
fact that the system does not have a regular winding of a linear chain in the dendrimer, the graph 
shows the maximum on the structure factor, which is responsible for the winding of a linear 
chain around (or partially also inside) the dendrimer. The presence of such the maximum usually 
is considered as an indirect evidence of the existence of a regular winding, however, as shown in 
this work, the maximum is observed in the system where there is no such structure of the 
complex. 
All results obtained within the framework of this project are new. They are published in 
leading scientific journals with high impact factor. All the results correspond to world standards, 
and some of them are at the forefront of the latest world scientific achievements. 
 
Methods used during the work 
Research within the framework of this project includes the experiment, analytical theory and 
multi-scale computer simulation. Experimental studies in the NTHU group have been performed 
using X-ray scattering and neutron scattering. Methods of computer simulation and analytical 
theory have been developed and applied by the MSU group. In particular, the calculation 
schemes for multi-scale computer simulations for systems of conjugated polymers and for 
complexes of linear polyelectrolytes and dendrimers have been elaborated. These schemes use 
different methods which description of phenomena on different spatial and temporal scales: the 
quantum-chemical calculations, atomistic molecular dynamics, coarse-grained molecular 
dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, methods of self-consistent field and macroscopic 
approaches based on the equations of state.

associated solvent molecules became long enough to yield a separate up-field-shifted NMR 
resonance. The line-shape of this resonance revealed alignment of the polymer segments in the 
aggregates. A portion of the solvent was frozen in the compact structure due to the formation of 
strong polymer-solvent complex. 
 
3. Scattering Study of the Conformational Structure and Aggregation Behavior of a 
Conjugated Polymer Solution  
The conformational structure and the interchain aggregation behavior of a semirigid 
conjugated polymer bearing a decyl side chain, 
poly(2,3-diphenyl-5-decyl-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (DP10-PPV), in solutions with chloroform 
and toluene have been investigated by means of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), static 
light scattering (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The radius of gyration, persistence 
length, and the second virial coefficient of the polymer in dilute solution as determined by SLS 
were higher in chloroform than in toluene; consequently, the polymer assumed a more extended 
wormlike chain conformation in the former. The difference in the strength of interaction in the 
two solvents gave rise to contrasting aggregation behavior of the polymer in the semidilute 
regime. While only a minor fraction of the polymer underwent segmental association in 
chloroform, a considerable fraction of it formed clusters (microgels) with several micrometers in 
size in toluene. These clusters were further found to consist of sheet-like nanodomains. 
Compared with the DP-PPV bearing a shorter hexyl side chain, DP6-PPV, the aggregates of 
DP10-PPV in toluene were weaker as they could be easily disrupted by moderate heating. This 
was attributed to a lack of strong pi-pi interaction between the DP10-PPV segments due to the 
greater steric hindrance imposed by the longer decyl side chains. 
 
4. Solvated poly-(phenylene vinylene) derivatives: conformational structure and 
aggregation behavior  
We have studid dilute solutions of poly(2,3-diphenyl phenylene vinylene) with hexyl 
(DP6-PPV) and decyl (DP10-PPV) side chains in two solvents, chloroform and toluene. For this 
purpose, atomistic and coarse-grained models are parametrized using quantum-chemical 
calculations and structure-based coarse-graining, respectively. Our simulations indicate that the 
difference in the aggregation behavior of two derivatives can not be rationalized just in terms of 
the greater steric hindrance imposed by the longer side chains of DP10-PPV. The coarse-grained 
model describes qualitatively the DP10-PPV derivative in chloroform, where aggregation does 
not occur. Although the computed structure factors for this system qualitatively agree with 
experiments for low concentrations, the calculated persistence length is bigger than the one 
experimentally reported, hinting at the presence of defects in polymer chains.

network structure having domains of aggregates of aligned
segments22 whereas in a poorer solvent methylcyclohexane
(MCH), the polymer forms disk or sheet-like aggregates even
in the dilute regime.14,15
The aggregation phenomena of conjugated polymers has always
been a concern for their optoelectronic applications, as the
presence of aggregates dramatically alters the photophysics of
the material.23 Considerable amount of study has been conducted
in the past few years to understand the aggregate structure in
relation to the photophysics of the polymers as a function of such
variables as solvent quality, molecular weight, side-chain structure
and length.12-15 However, studies on the temperature dependence
of the aggregation behavior11,22 is scarce in the literature. These
studies mainly utilized scattering techniques to discern the global
aggregate structure and absorption and photoluminescence
spectroscopy for identifying the effects of the aggregates on the
photophysics. Nevertheless, the internal structure of these
aggregates and the nature of interaction involved are still obscured
because of the inherent limitations of the tools of investigation.
In this study we report a simple approach for resolving the
mechanism of segmental aggregation of PF2/6 in toluene using
1H NMR spectroscopy. This polymer tends to form aggregate
domains at subambient temperatures. When the solution tem-
perature is sufficiently low, a portion of the solvent gets
encapsulated or bound within the aggregate domains of PF2/6.
Isolation of the bound solvent from the bulk solution causes a
separate upfield-shifted resonance line for the former. By
analyzing the intensity and line-shape of this resonance, we are
able to show that it is the π-π stacking interaction between the
solvent molecules and the polymer segments that stabilizes the
aggregate domains. This greatly modifies the intuitive under-
standing that the aggregation of conjugated polymers in the
solution state is driven by the π-π interaction between the
polymer segments.
Experimental Section
Poly[9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl], (PF2/6) end-capped
with dimethylphenyl groups was obtained from American Dye
Source, Inc., Quebec, Canada. Its molecular weights were measured
by GPC using THF as the eluting solvent against polystyrene
standards. Most of the works in this study were carried out with the
sample having Mw) 54600 and PDI) 2.6. Another lower molecular
weight polymer (Mw ) 15000 and PDI ) 3.0) was also used for
comparison purpose. Weighed amount of the PF2/6 was first dissolved
in 0.5 mL toluene-d8 (99.6 atom % 2H, Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories, Inc., U.S.A.) by gently warming in a water bath at 50
°C followed by stirring overnight at room temperature (ca. 25 °C).
The solution was subsequently transferred into an NMR tube (5 mm
diameter) and capped with silicon rubber septum. The concentration
of the solution (g of polymer per 100 mL solution, %) was estimated
from the height of the solution in the NMR tube calibrated to the
volume. 1H NMR measurements were conducted at 499.84 MHz on
a Varian UnityInova-500 NMR spectrometer. For the observation
of the development of aggregates at subambient temperatures, the
sample was rapidly cooled to -20 or -30 °C and allowed to attain
thermal equilibrium before acquiring the spectra (the process took
15 min at -20 °C and about 30 min at -30 °C inside the NMR
instrument). 1H NMR relaxation times of degassed (by bubbling dry
N2) samples were measured by the inversion recovery pulse sequence,
i.e., π-τd-π/2-acquire sequence, with π ) 25.2 µs, τd ranging
between 0.01 s and 64 s and a dead time of 40 s using the same
instrument.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the 500 MHz 1H NMR spectra of 0.5% and
4.0% solutions of PF2/6 in toluene-d8 at 25 °C. Both spectra
contain broad and overlapped resonance bands for the PF2/6
backbone aromatic and side-chain aliphatic protons and few sharp
lines for the residual protons from toluene-d8. A small upfield
shift in the polymer resonance bands can be identified for the
4.0% solution relative to the 0.5% one. Few small peaks can also
be identified between 5.6 and 5.8 ppm in the spectrum of the
4.0% solution, which are below the detection limit in the spectrum
of the 0.5% solution, as shown in the magnified window of the
spectra in Figure 1.
Upon cooling to -20 °C from the ambient temperature,
solutions with concentrations ranging between 0.5% and 5.3%
all displayed an additional sharp resonance line at 5.75 ppm in
1H spectra. Spectra of 0.5% and 4.0% solutions are shown in
Figure 2 as representative. It is noted that the sharp line is absent
in the room-temperature spectra, although a few weak resonances
can be observed in the same region of the spectrum of the 4.0%

in dilute methylcyclohexane solutions at below ambient tem-
peratures have been described as anisotropic ordered domains
of lamellar phases, somewhat similar to the lamellar structures
of ordered smectic phases, rather than true crystallites.11 Under
the influence of the magnetic field of the NMR spectrometer,
these segments should tend to orient their long axis along the
magnetic field direction in a manner similar to the liquid crystal
phases or the lipid based bicelles in aqueous dispersion.33-37
For individual solvent molecules or polymer segments, the
energy required to tumble in the magnetic field for NMR
measurements is small compared to the thermal energy; as a
result, these molecules or segments would not orient in the
magnetic field. However, an array of a large number of coupled
or correlated molecules (such as in liquid crystals) or aligned
segments of macromolecules (such as in the aggregates) should
result in a magnetic torque large enough to induce appreciable
orientational order in relatively low magnetic field strengths.
The entrapped solvent molecules inside the aggregate domains
would also gain a fixed orientation relative to the magnetic field.
This is analogous to the study of the nuclear spin interactions
of small molecules using liquid crystal solvent, where the system
of interest is oriented in the liquid crystalline (director) phase
that has been aligned with a fixed orientation relative to the
magnetic field. Depending on the orientation of the individual
interaction tensors (chemical shift, or dipolar coupling) and the
relative orientation of the molecules with the external field, several
sharp NMR absorptions occur over a wide range of frequen-
cies.35,37-39 This resonance hardly coincides with the motional
averaged line of the molecule.
On the basis of the above discussion, it is apparent that the
sharp line at 5.75 ppm for residual protons of associated toluene
in Figure 2 is a consequence of the liquid crystal-like alignment
of the polymer segments in the aggregate domains. The molecular
(C2) axis of entrapped toluene gets a definite orientation relative
to the magnetic field and the residual para-proton containing the
said axis gives rise to the sharp resonance. The orientation of
the C2 axis probably causes the resonances of the ortho- and the
meta-protons to shift outside the measured frequency range, as
a consequence they are not observed in the spectra. Such
orientation, however, should cause numerous sharp, nonmotional-
averaged resonance lines for para-proton of the associated toluene
due to dipolar coupling with the neighboring protons. Observing
only one of them located between 5 and 6 ppm means that no
such dipolar interaction is effective. This is reasonable for the
99.6 atom % deuterated toluene used as the solvent. However,
existence of such dipolar coupling could not be observed even
when 2% (v/v) pure toluene was mixed with the deuterated solvent
(see Figure 6 below). The plausible reason is that the associated
toluene molecules are transient (see below) and they exchange
with the nonassociated ones at a rate which is fast compared to
the proton dipolar coupling constants, resulting in decoupling.40
The exchange rate, however, is slow enough on the chemical
shift time scale to display separate resonances, as mentioned
earlier.
If the toluene molecules were associated within aggregates
consisting of randomly oriented segments, they would not take
a definite orientation with respect to the magnetic field direction;
in which case the motional averaged three-line shape of the
residual aromatic proton resonance of deuterated toluene should
be identified. This is indeed observed in the room-temperature
spectrum of the 4.0% solution (inset of Figure 1) in the same
region where a small extent of such aggregates is present in the
solution.
The association of the solvent within the aggregates of randomly
oriented segments formed at room temperature is more clearly
evident in case of a 5.0% solution of a PF2/6 sample of lower
molecular weight (Mw ) 15000, PDI ) 3), as shown in Figure
3. When the temperature is lowered to -20 °C, the sharp line
for the oriented toluene associated with the newly formed
aggregates appears at 5.75 ppm that superposes on the three
solvent lines existing in the room-temperature spectrum. If the
temperature is lowered to -30 °C instead, the extra resonance
line appears at a downfield shifted position whereas the position
of the three-lines of the solvent associated with room-temperature
aggregates suffer only little perturbation, allowing clear visu-
alization of the coexistence of two contrasting types of aggregates,
i.e., the one formed during solution preparation at room
temperature has randomly oriented segments and the other
developed during the cooling in the NMR probe has most of the
segments aligned their long axis parallel to each other. This is
an important finding in that the magnetic field actually induces
alignment of the segments in the aggregate domains. This finding
also has the far reaching practical consequence as a convenient
method for producing oriented films of conjugate polymers from
solutions under the influence of a magnetic field,41 which are of
interest for applications in field-effect transistors (FETs)42,43 and
the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for linearly polarized elec-
troluminescence.44,45
The 0.17 ppm less upfield shift for the associated solvent line
at -30 °C relative to that at -20 °C is likely due to the change
of the orientation of the C2 axis toward the magic angle (54.7°)
as a consequence of the temperature drop, and hence leads to the
shift of the line toward the isotropic value. There is also a
compaction of the segments due to the temperature drop that
limits the space for accommodating the solvent molecules in the
aggregates, causing a reduction in the intensity of the associated
solvent line at -30 °C relative to that at -20 °C.

molecules is transient. The intensity profile of the signal (inset
of Figure 5) shows that the approach to equilibrium follows a
two-stage process. Furthermore, the linear decay suggests that
the two processes are both of zeroth order, i.e., not dependent
upon the concentration of the trapped solvent. The initial stage
decays linearly up to ∼110 min followed by a steeper drop at
a rate ca. 3.4 times that of the initial stage. The resonance line
disappears after ∼200 min.
The question then arises as to why the associated solvent
signal vanishes. This can simply be due to the fact that a large
fraction of the entrapped solvent is expelled out of the aligned
aggregates as the polymer segments become compact on aging
at -20 °C. Nevertheless, certain amount of the solvent
molecules is always closely bound to the aggregate segments
and their NMR intensity eventually disappears as their mobility
decreases in a tight entrapment. By examining the intensity
profile of the polymer backbone and the side-chains as a
function of the annealing time shown in Figure 5b, we observe
a loss of intensity of ca. 13% and 10% for backbone and side-
chain protons, respectively, upon cooling to -20 °C due to loss
of motional narrowing upon aggregation. As the amount of the
aggregated segments is quite appreciable, the entrapped solvent
signal is apparent. The two-stage nature of the intensity loss of
the signal suggests that two different mechanisms for the intensity
loss are operative. The initial loss is likely due to expulsion of
the excess solvent, which is a slow process. When most of the
excess solvent is excluded, the parallel segments quickly densify
with the fluorenyl planes facing each other, and with the aromatic
plane of toluene sandwiched between them, possibly in some
slipped (offset) face-to-face geometry25,26 where the methyl group
of toluene stay outside the stack, avoiding any steric hindrance
to the stacking. This forms a strong polymer-solvent π-π
complex where the reorientation of the aromatic plane of toluene
about the C2 axis is hindered and ultimately becomes practically
inaccessible in a tight entrapment. As a result of the lost mobility
the entrapped solvent signal eventually vanishes. When the toluene
approach closer to the fluorenyl plane, the residual aromatic
protons experience a higher diamagnetic field from the ring current
of the latter and consequently upfield shifted. At the same time
the width of the trapped solvent line at half-maximum becomes
larger as the molecules lose mobility when the segments densify
with time. Both these facts are clearly evident in Figure 5c where
the trapped solvent line has been shown as a function of the
annealing time.
For a 5.3% solution of PF2/6 in toluene-d8 mixed with 2%
(v/v) pure toluene, the associated solvent appears as two
overlapped lines contributed from the two solvents (Figure
6). Here the upfield shift of the associated solvent resonance is
readily apparent as the segments densify. Another important
feature of the resonance from this more concentrated solution
is that it takes longer times to reduce the intensity and does not
completely vanish even after 9 h of annealing. It is also noted
that the two-stage nature of the drop of intensity is not prominent
here (inset of Figure 6). This is because when the more
concentrated solution is cooled the segments of the aggregates
formed are much more crowded, making the diffusion of the
excess solvent out of the aggregates difficult. The higher viscosity
(due to chain entanglement) also prevents the parallely arranged
layers to assume the compact geometry quickly. In this case, the
polymer-solvent complex can never attain a highly ordered
compact structure, thereby still allowing the motion of some of
the associated solvent molecules. As a result the associated solvent
line can be observed even after 9 h of annealing.
We note here that the formation of the aggregates of aligned
segments at subambient temperatures under the influence of
the magnetic field and the transient entrapment of the solvent
in them seem to be a characteristic of conjugated polymer
solutions. We have observed that PF8 does not form aggregates
in toluene solutions at ambient temperatures when the
concentration is below 1%.22 However when such a solution
is brought to -20 °C in the NMR probe, this polymer also
forms aggregates of aligned segments in which some solvent
is entrapped and behaves similarly to the PF2/6/toluene system
with respect to the annealing phenomenon. For similar
concentrations, however, the solvent entrapped in the PF8
aggregates diffuses out much quicker compared to the PF2/
6/toluene system. Thus for a 0.57% solution it takes only
about 40 min for the entrapped solvent signal to disappear
(Supporting Information) compared to the 200 min required
even for a slightly lower concentration in the PF2/6 case (Figure

from the solution properties of poly(alkythiophenes).13-15
Gettinger et al. have reported that increasing the size of the
solubilizing side chains increased the intrinsic persistence
length of poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) backbone, and the
resulting change in chain stiffness exerted a strong effect on
the photoluminescence of the polymer.16
The aggregation behavior of a variety of conjugated poly-
mers has also been investigated by small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS). Perahia et al. utilized SANS to probe
the aggregate structure of a conjugated polymer, poly(2,5-
dinonylparaphenylene ethynylene) (PPE), in toluene solu-
tions.17,18 The triple bonds along the backbone imparted
conformational rigidity to the molecule, making the PPE
chains assume rodlike conformation. These rodlikemolecules
aggregated into large flat clusters driven by π-π interaction
below ca. 40 C.When the aggregates were too large to move
freely in the solution, a transition into a constrained or
jammed phase took place, transforming the viscous solution
into a gel. Poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl) (PF8) is another
polymer whose aggregation behavior in solution state has
been probed by SANS. It has been revealed that PF8 could be
dissolved down to themolecular level in dilute (0.5-1.0 wt%)
toluene solutions where they remained as stiff rods.19 The
polymer chains aggregated to form a network structure con-
taining domains of aggregates of aligned segments in the
semidilute toluene solution.20 By contrast, the dissolution of
PF8 only reached the colloidal level, giving rise to sheetlike
aggregates in a poor solvent, methylcyclohexane (MCH).19 A
recent systematic study byKnaapila et al. on the effect of side
chain length on the aggregation of polyfluorenes has revealed
that the formation of sheetlike aggregates inMCHwas rather
universal, and the larger length scale structures of these sheets
showed an odd-even dependence on the side length.21
Recently, we reported the interchain aggregation behavior
of poly(2,3-diphenyl-5-hexyl-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (DP6-
PPV) bearing hexyl side chains in the solutions with chloro-
form and toluene.22 DP-PPVs have been considered as a
family of green-emitting material for LED application due
to their high glass transition temperature, high fluorescence
efficiency and ease of monomer and polymer syntheses.23-26
Using SANS, we have revealed that the aggregation of
DP6-PPV in chloroform and toluene yielded network aggre-
gates whose internal structure could be characterized by
certain fractal dimensions. Two types of segmental associa-
tion with distinct stability were identified for the toluene
solution. The highly stable segmental association was attrib-
uted to the π-π complex already present in the DP6-PPV
powder, while the other type of labile segmental association
was ascribed to the poor affinity of the aliphatic side chains of
DP6-PPV to toluene.
Herein we report a comparative study of the conforma-
tional structure and aggregation behavior of a DP-PPV
bearing a longer decyl side chain, i.e., poly(2,3-diphenyl-5-
decyl-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (DP10-PPV). In conjunction
with the previous results of DP6-PPV, we attempt to reveal
the role of the side-chain length in the interchain assembly of
DP-PPVs in the solution state. The chemical structure of
DP10-PPV is shown in Scheme 1.
Intuitively, the incorporation of the longer decyl side chains
in DP10-PPV should impose a stronger steric hindrance
(relative to that of DP6-PPV) against the interchain aggrega-
tion of the polymer; therefore, the aggregate structure of
DP10-PPV may be different from that of DP6-PPV. In
addition to the aggregation behavior in the semidilute solu-
tion, the conformational structure of DP10-PPV in the dilute
regime, where the interchain aggregation was not significant,
has also been investigated by means of static light scattering
(SLS) here. It will be shown that, although DP10-PPV dis-
plays a weaker tendency toward aggregation than DP6-PPV,
this polymer is still able to aggregate in semidilute solutions,
generating aggregates with hydrodynamic radii of submic-
rometer to 10 μm in size depending on the concentration.
These aggregates are however loosely bound by the micelle-
like association of segments that can be easily disrupted by
moderate heating.
Experimental Section
Materials and Solution Preparation. DP10-PPV was syn-
thesized according to the procedure described elsewhere.23-26
The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer was
463 000 g/mol as measured by SLS using chloroform solvent.
The polymer solutions with the concentrations rang-
ing from 0.001 to 1.0 wt % were prepared by dissolving an
appropriate amount of the polymer in chloroform and toluene.
The mixtures of the polymer and the solvent were stirred at
ca. 40 C for 12 h, where macroscopically homogeneous solu-
tions were observed by the naked eye after the stirring.
d-Solvents were used for preparing the solutions for SANS
study to enhance the contrast in neutron scattering length
densities (SLDs).

The former effect is evidenced by the slightly larger Rg in
chloroform solution than that in toluene.
Knowing the value of Rg, the persistence length, lp, of
DP10-PPV can be calculated using the Kratky-Porod
wormlike chain model,16,33 which prescribes the Rg as
Rg
2 ¼ lpL

¼ lploM

where L is the contour length of the polymer, Mo is the
monomer molecular weight, and lo is the monomer length.
The molecular weight of DP10-PPV used in this study is
463 000 g/mol, and the monomer molecular weight and
length are 394 g/mol and 5.7 A˚, respectively. The contour
length of the DP10-PPV chain calculated from its molecular
weight and monomer length is hence ca. 670.5 nm. The
values of lp calculated from eq 4 for DP10-PPV in chloro-
form and toluene dilute solutions are tabulated in Table 1.
Here we should note that eq 4 is valid for an ideal chain or for
a chain with excluded volume but under θ conditions,
and therefore the data for the persistence length in Table 1
should be considered as a rough estimation to demonstrate
the trend, namely, the values only represent the apparent
persistence length. This persistence length is found to be
larger for the polymer in chloroform, showing that the
polymer chains are stiffer or more expanded in this better-
quality solvent. Our theoretical calculations based on the
microscopic atomistic model for calculation of interaction
potential between effective monomer units, which is then
combined with the Flory-Huggins model (see the Support-
ing Information), also support our statement that the ap-
parent persistence lengths in both solvents are indeed
attributable to the difference in thermodynamic solvent
quality.
2. Conformational Structure andAggregationBehavior of
DP10-PPV in Semidilute Solutions Studied by SANS. We
found that the solutions with concentrations lying above
0.1 wt% are able to give rise to neutron scattering intensities
with reasonably good signal-to-noise ratio. In this case, the
conformational and aggregate structure of the polymer
chains may be elucidated directly from the SANS intensity
profiles.
Figure 2 shows the room-temperature SANS profiles of
DP10-PPV in chloroform solutions at three different con-
centrations. The SANS intensities follow I(q) ∼ q-1 depen-
dence in the high-q region (q > ∼0.03 A˚-1), irrespective of
the polymer concentration due to the rodlike nature of the
segments constituting the DP10-PPV chains.22,34 In the low-
q region (q< 0.03 A˚-1), the scattering intensities are found
to exhibit upturns. Such an upturn may be due to the
aggregation of the chain segments or associated with the
crossover of the wormlike conformation of the well-
dispersed polymer chains from the rodlike character under
larger spatial resolution to the flexible regime under smaller
spatial resolution.35 The contribution of interchain aggrega-
tion to the intensity upturn is indeed unlikely considering
that the intensities are quite weak (with the order of magni-
tude of 10-2 cm-1 comparing to 10-1 cm-1 for 0.1 wt %
DP6-PPV/chloroform solution showing obvious interchain
aggregation). Moreover, when the intensities are normalized
by the overall polymer concentration (see Supporting In-
formation), the normalized intensities of 0.5 and 1.0 wt %
solutions are indeed lower than that of 0.1 wt % solution in
the low-q region (i.e., the increase in the scattering intensity is
less than that prescribed by the concentration increase). If
the interchain aggregation dominated the low-q intensity
upturn, the opposite trend should have been observed as a
result of stronger aggregation power at higher polymer
concentrations. Therefore, we consider the whole scattering
curves in Figure 2 to be dominated by the form factor of the
DP10-PPV wormlike chains. In other words, most DP10-
PPV chains are well dispersed in chloroform.
The SANS profiles in Figure 2 are fitted by the wormlike
chainmodelwith excluded volume interaction. In thismodel,
the polymer chain is treated as a flexible cylinder with a
circular cross section and a uniformSLD.The non-negligible
diameter of the cylinder is included by accounting for the
excluded volume interaction36,37 (the expression of the scat-
tering intensity of this model can be found in the Supporting
Information). The fitting results are displayed by the solid
curves superposing on the experimental scattering profiles,

For the 0.1 wt% solution, the contrast-normalized SANS
profile superposes quite well with that of the chloroform
solution, showing that the aggregation is minor, and the
SANS profile is still dominated by the form factor of the
worm-like chain. The corresponding fitting using the worm-
like chain model yields the persistence length of 5.5 nm. This
value is smaller than that found forDP10-PPV in chloroform
at the same concentration, which is consistent with the SLS
results, suggesting that the polymer chains adopt a more
expanded conformation in chloroform.
When the concentration is increased to 0.5 and 1.0 wt %,
the scattering intensities display q-2 power law, which
suggests that the micrometer-sized aggregates of DP10-
PPV contain sheetlike nanodomains. The solid curves
superposing on the corresponding scattering profiles in
Figure 4 represent the fits using the form factor of randomly
oriented disks (see Supporting Information for the equa-
tion of the form factor of disk). This fitting yields the
thickness of the sheetlike domains of ca. 2.0 nm, irrespective
of the concentration. It should be noted that, although theRg
of the sheetlike domains can be obtained from the fittings,
the values are not considered to be highly meaningful,
because the Guinier region is not accessed under the q range
studied. The value of the thickness, which is determined by
the scattering profile in the high-q region, is nevertheless
reliable.
Considering the fact that the diameter of the DP10-PPV
chain obtained from the fitting using the wormlike chain
model is ca. 9 A˚, the sheetlike nanodomains in the aggregates
may consist of a bilayer of DP10-PPV chains lying flatly on
the sheet surface, as schematically shown in Figure 6. Similar
sheetlike domains formed by the segmental aggregation have
also been observed for other conjugated polymers such as
poly(2-methoxy-5-(2’-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene)
Figure 3. AFM topographic image of DP10-PPV cast from 0.008
mg/mL chloroform solution onHPOG. The dispersed wormlike coil
structure several micrometers in size and some segmental associates
formed by the polymer chains are observed over a large area.
Figure 4. Room-temperature SANS profiles of DP10-PPV in to-
luene solutions at different polymer concentrations. The intensities
exhibit a power law of I(q) ∼ q-2 at the higher concentrations of 0.5
and 1.0 wt % over nearly the entire q range studied. The SANS
intensities at these twoconcentrationsare considered tobedominated
by the internal structure of the aggregates formed in toluene, where
themicrometer-sized aggregates contain sheetlike nanodomains. The
solid curves superposing on the corresponding scattering profiles
represent the fits using the form factor of randomly oriented disks.
The SANSprofile of 0.1 wt% solution is considered to be dominated

curve superposing on the experimental data corresponds to the fit
using the wormlike chain model with excluded volume interaction.

which is consistent with the foregoing postulate that the
corresponding SANS profiles are dominated by the aggre-
gates. In this case, the Rh value of the slow mode is con-
sidered as a measure of the size of the clusters or micro-
gel networks originating from the segmental association
that yields the sheetlike nanodomains acting as the physical
cross-links for the microgel networks. Consequently, in
contrast to chloroform solutions where the segmental
association is not so severe, the amplitudes of the fast and
the intermediate relaxation modes reduce remarkably as a
result of the formation of the aggregate structures, and the
slow mode becomes the dominant relaxation mode for the
0.5 and 1.0 wt % toluene solutions.
Recently, we reported the aggregation behavior of DP6-
PPV in the solution state.22 This polymer with hexyl side
chains shows a strong interchain aggregation even in chloro-
form, and the network aggregates thus generated dominate
the SANS intensity. However, the present study has demon-
strated that a major fraction of DP10-PPV chains remain
well dispersed in chloroform, indicating that increasing the
length of the flexible side chains attached to the PPV back-
bone tends to suppress the interchain aggregation. The effect
of side-chain length that results in different dissolution
behavior is further demonstrated by comparing SANS in-
tensities normalized by the corresponding neutron SLD
contrasts of the two polymers, I(q)/ΔF2, as shown in Figure 8
for the 1.0 wt % solution. It can be seen that DP6-PPV
clearly shows a much stronger intensity in the low-q region,
which is consistent with a much more severe interchain
aggregation in solution. For DP6-PPV, we have proposed
that the aggregation observed in the chloroform solution
stems primarily from incomplete dissolution of a fraction of
the hairy-rod segments of the polymer. This fraction in fact
forms highly a stable π-π complex in the solid DP6-PPV
powder used for solution preparation.22 This kind of π-π
complex is formed by in-plane stacking of the phenylene or
the phenyl moieties in DP6-PPV, and a characteristic dis-
tance of ca. 3.0A˚ between the aromatic groups forming the
complex leads to a peak at 2θ ≈ 29 in its wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXS) profile.43 This species could neither be
solvated by chloroform nor be disrupted by heating; as a
result, the chains tied firmly by the π-π complex form the
network aggregates in the solution.
Because of its longer flexible side chains, DP10-PPV
remainswell dispersed in chloroform.Thuswemay speculate
that the highly stable π-π complex found in DP6-PPV may
be absent in the DP10-PPV powder. This assumption is
corroborated by Figure 9, which compares the WAXS
profiles of DP10-PPV powder with that of DP6-PPV pow-
der. It can be seen that DP6-PPV displays a higher degree of
crystallinity and shows a strong scattering peak at 2θ= 29
(corresponding to a Bragg spacing of 3.0 A˚) associated with
the π-π complex. This peak is however missing in the
WAXS profile of DP10-PPV powder, indicating the lack of
π-π complex formation in this polymer. In this case, the
stronger steric hindrance imposed by the longer decyl side
chains in DP10-PPV may impede the complex formation in
the powder. Hence, a uniform dispersion of polymer chains
in chloroform becomes accessible for DP10-PPV.
4. Disruption of the Aggregates of DP10-PPV in Toluene
Solution by Heating. According to our previous study of
DP6-PPV, the micelle-like segmental association formed in
toluene is relatively unstable, as it can be disrupted by
moderate heating.22 Figure 10 shows a series of SANS
profiles of 1.0 wt % DP10-PPV/toluene solution collected
in situ at various temperatures in a heating process. The
scattering intensity in the low-q region drops suddenly when
the temperature is increased to 55 C, showing the occur-
rence of deaggregation upon heating, similar to the DP6-
PPV system. Also, the q-1 power law emerges in the high-q
region as a result of the increased population of the molecu-
larly dissolved chains. Heating to 70 C completely wipes out
the segmental aggregation, as the scattering profile at this

higher temperatures, and the slow mode finally vanishes
above 45 C. Meanwhile, the amplitude of the intermediate
mode associated with the dynamics of individual DP10-PPV
worm-like chains increases with increasing temperature, as a
result of an increase in the concentration of molecularly
dispersed DP10-PPV chains arising from the disintegration
of the intermolecular aggregates on heating. These results
imply that the micelle-like segmental association of DP10-
PPV in toluene solutions is ratherweak, as it can be disrupted
by moderate heating. This is in identical with that found for
DP6-PPV/toluene solutions.
Conclusions
We have investigated the effects of solvent quality, concen-
tration, and temperature on the conformational structure and
the interchain aggregationbehavior ofDP10-PPV in solutions
with chloroform and toluene by SANS, SLS, and DLS.
The polymer-solvent interaction between DP10-PPV and
chloroform was stronger than that between DP10-PPV and
toluene; consequently, in dilute solutions, the DP10-PPV
chains assumed a more extended wormlike conformation
in chloroform. The persistence length ofDP10-PPV in chloro-
form was found to increase with increasing concentration due
to the excluded volume interaction. The interchain aggrega-
tion started to set in as the concentration exceeded 0.1 wt% in
both solutions. The extent of aggregation was, however,
minor in chloroform but became significant in toluene solu-
tions with concentrations ofg0.5 wt%. The aggregation gave
rise a slow relaxation mode with a corresponding hydrody-
namic radius of 200 nm to 10 μm as measured by DLS. This
relaxation mode was attributed to the formation of micro-
meter-sized clusters or microgel networks in which a fraction
of the hairy-rod segments associated to form sheetlike nano-
domains that acted as the physical cross-links for the net-
works. Nearly all aggregates of DP10-PPV in toluene
solutions could be disintegrated by moderate heating. This
was in clear distinction fromDP6-PPV,where a fractionof the
segments ofDP6-PPV formed highly stableπ-π complexes in
the solid powder, and such a strong segmental association
(that couldneither be solvated by chloroformnorbe disrupted
by heating) persisted in the solution state. The strong π-π
complex was absent in DP10-PPV because the longer decyl
side chain imposed a large steric effect, preventing the effective
in-plane stacking of the phenylene or the phenyl moieties in
DP10-PPV.

dynamic light scattering (DLS).13 It could be shown that DP6-
PPV tends to aggregate in chloroform and toluene, yielding
network aggregates whose internal structure can be characterized
by a certain fractal dimension. Two types of segmental associa-
tion with distinct stability were identified for the toluene solu-
tion. The highly stable segmental association was attributed to
the p–p complex already present in the DP6-PPV powder, while
the labile segmental association was ascribed to the poor affinity
of the aliphatic side chains of DP6-PPV to toluene. An analogous
study for DP10-PPV14 showed that only a minor fraction of the
polymer undergoes segmental association in chloroform,
whereas in toluene disk-like clusters are formed. The difference in
aggregation behavior between DP6- and DP10-PPV was attri-
buted to the more pronounced steric repulsion of the longer side-
chains in the latter polymer.
The paper is organized as follows. First, we re-parametrize and
validate the potential energy surface of the atomistic force-field
for DP-PPVs using first principles calculations. Then, the results
of the atomistic simulations of dilute DP-PPV solutions are
presented. Special attention is paid to side-chain stretching,
backbone orientational correlations, chain tacticity, and the
influence of side groups on the backbone planarity. Subse-
quently, atomistic trajectories of a single chain in a solvent in
combination with the potential of mean force calculations are
used to parametrize a coarse-grained model with two repeat units
per bead and coarse-grained simulations are performed. These
then serve to study large-scale systems and to determine how
static structure factors and persistence length change as a func-
tion of polymer concentration. We summarize our work by
comparing simulation results to experimental data and by
commenting on the limitations of our multiscale approach.
All atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simul-
ations were performed using the GROMACS package,15,16 while
the coarse-graining procedure itself was done with the VOTCA
package.17 First principle calculations were performed with the
GAUSSIAN package.18
2 Force-field development
As a starting point, we use the OPLS all-atom force-field.19
Parameters for bonds, angles as well as van der Waals parame-
ters for non-bonded interactions are taken from this force-field.
Partial charges and missing bonded interactions are determined
using first principles calculations.20–22 The force-field parametri-
zation is then verified by simulating several thermodynamic
properties of trans-stilbene, whose chemical structure is shown in
Fig. 1b.
2.1 Partial charges
The CHELPG procedure was used to calculate the partial
charges.23 For geometry optimization we used hybrid DFT
functional B3LYP24 as well as Møller–Plesset second order
perturbation theory (MP2). To illustrate the basis set conver-
gence, the charges of the atoms 6 and 12 (see Fig. 1b) are listed in
Table 1 as a function of the basis set. One can see that for small
basis sets, the variation is about 20%. Saturation is achieved for
a rather large basis set, 6-311G++(2d,2p). The DFT values agree
well with MP2 calculations, especially for large basis sets. To
assess the values of partial charges in a polymer, we have also
performed calculations for tetra- and octamers. No significant
variations were found. The list of partial charges is available in
the Supporting Information.
2.2 Parametrization of backbone dihedrals
To refine the force-field parameters for dihedral angles, we first
considered the backbone without the side chains as shown in
Fig. 1b. Three dihedral potentials, which are not present in the
OPLS force-field, determine the rigidity and conformation of the
backbone. To obtain parameters for these potentials, the angle of
interest was scanned by optimizing the molecular geometry for
a fixed value of the dihedral. The scan provides a set of optimized
molecular structures and total energies for each angle value.
Subsequently, the energy of each optimized conformation was
evaluated with the help of the force-field, where the dihedral of
interest was switched off. To do this, the molecular geometry was
again optimized for each value of the constrained dihedral angle
and the difference between the two energies was fitted, providing
the desired dihedral parameters.25
For the dihedrals (1-6-12-14) and (6-12-14-16) (see Fig. 1b) the
functional form given by eqn (1) was used, while for the improper
dihedral (6-1-5-12) the functional form given by eqn (2) was used
V ¼ kf[1 + cos(2f  f0)] (1)
V ¼ ½kf(f  f0)2 (2)
where f0 is the equilibrium angle and kf is the fitted force
constant.
The results of fitting are shown in Fig. 2. For the first dihedral,
(1-6-12-14), different levels of theory provide different equili-
brium values of the dihedral angle. MP2 calculations suggest that
the ground state of trans-stilbene is nonplanar contrary to the
DFT calculations. In fact, the discrepancy between these
methods is a known issue. A more detailed study of trans-stilbene
shows that it is planar and the value of the torsional barrier is
14.3 kJ/mol.26 This value was used for fitting. The results for all
three dihedrals are summarized in Table 2.
2.3 Force-field validation
To validate the force-field, we compared the dimensions of the
simulated and experimentally measured unit cell of trans-stilbene
crystal and its melting temperature.

the results, we also annealed a 4a  6b  4c cell. The results are
shown in Fig. 3, indicating that there are no significant finite size
effects. Within the range of 0.07–0.3 deg/ps, we did not observe
any dependence on the heating rate.
In summary, we can conclude that the performance of our
force-field for trans-stilbene is adequate.
2.4 DP-PPV force-field
To derive the force-field for DP6-PPV and DP10-PPV, we
followed the same strategy. We first calculated the partial charges
of a DP-PPV monomer unit and then parametrized two addi-
tional dihedral potentials. The first one, linking phenyl rings to
the backbone and the second one, connecting the backbone
phenyl ring and the alkyl side chain. The Ryckaert-Belleman
functional form30 was used to parametrize these two dihedrals

where f ¼ 0 corresponds to the trans-conformation. The
obtained constants, Cn, are given in Table 4. For the alkyl side
chains, we used the OPLS united atom force-field.19 The force-
field files (in GROMACS format) are available in the Supporting
Information.
2.5 Solvents
A four-site model was used for chloroform. In this represent-
ation, one molecule consists of 3 chlorine atoms (Cl) and one
united atom (CH). Corresponding Lennard-Jones parameters
and partial charges are given in Table 5. The bonded
parameters for the CH–Cl bond were b0 ¼ 0.17580 nm, kb ¼
459403.2 kJ mol1 nm2. For the Cl–CH–Cl angle: q0 ¼ 111 deg,
kq ¼ 600 kJ mol1 rad2. For toluene, the CH3 group was
combined in a united atom, while the rest of the atoms were
treated explicitly.31,32
To test the force-field performance for solvents, we equili-
brated 125 chloroform molecules for 2 ns in an NPT ensemble at
temperature 300 K and pressure 1 bar. The equilibrium density
of 1.45  0.01 g/cm3 was in excellent agreement with the
experimental value of 1.48 g/cm3. The calculated diffusion
coefficient of D ¼ (2.94  0.01)  105 cm2/s was also in
a reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 2.32 
105 cm2/s.33
For toluene, both the simulated density of 0.869  0.004 g/cm3
and the diffusion constant of (2.2  0.1)  105 cm2/s agreed well
with the experimentally measured values of 0.87 g/cm3 and 2.1 
105 cm2/s respectively.34
3 Atomistic molecular dynamics
In this section, we present results of our atomistic molecular
dynamics simulations such as side chain stretching, planarity of
the backbone, and chain persistence length in two solvents.
Throughout the text, we use the following abbreviations for
different polymer derivatives, solvents, and backbone lengths:
each system name begins either with D6 or D10, corresponding
to DP6-PPV or DP10-PPV respectively. An additional letter
denotes the solvent: ‘‘c’’ is for chloroform and ‘‘t’’ for toluene.
Finally, a number for the backbone chain length, in repeat units,
is added. For example, D6c20 is a 20 monomer units long DP6-
PPV derivative in chloroform. Unless otherwise stated, all
simulations were performed at 300 K.
3.1 Alkyl side chain stretching in solvated DP-PPV
Experimentally, chloroform is considered to be a relatively good
solvent for both DP6- and DP10-PPV derivatives, whereas
toluene is a relatively poor one. Additional segmental aggrega-
tion in toluene relative to chloroform is often ascribed to the
poor affinity of the aliphatic side chains of DP-PPV for
toluene.13,14 To check this, we analyzed alkyl side chain stretching
in both solvents.
A 10-mer of DP6- or DP10-PPV was simulated in chloroform
and toluene for 40 ns and the corresponding distributions of the
side chain end-to-end distances are shown in Fig. 4. As one can
see, the distributions are identical for both solvents, i.e. the
difference in solvent quality does not affect the side chain
conformations, at least in our atomistic model. The same
conclusion could be made when simulating an all-atom hexane
chain (which corresponds to a side chain of DP6-PPV) in
chloroform and toluene, where again, no effect of solvent quality
on chain conformations was detected.
Experimentally, solvent quality can be characterized via the
second virial coefficient A2, which can be determined from static
light scattering experiments.14 A2 ¼ 6.7  106mol dm3 g2 was
reported for chloroform and 3.7  106 mol dm3 g2 for toluene.
This difference is rather small and poses the question of whether
toluene is a poorer solvent than chloroform only because of the
additional chain aggregation observed in toluene solutions.13,14 It
is also interesting that toluene is often reported to be a good
solvent for another PPV derivative, MEH-PPV,35 as well as for
polyfluorenes with longer alkyl side chains.36,37 This further
suggests that both toluene and chloroform might be relatively
good solvents for DP-PPVs and that aggregation is an artifact of
an initial non-equilibrium state of polymer chains in a powder.
3.2 Orientational correlations in solvated DP-PPV
Orientational correlations of the polymer backbone can be used
to calculate the persistence length of a chain, which can be
directly compared to experimental values.

strongly suppressed due to the presence of the phenyl rings. For
the DP10-PPV derivative, the situation is qualitatively similar.
Namely, longer alkyl side chains lead to an even broader distri-
bution of the dihedral angle f2.
The final issue we would like to address here is the tacticity of
a DP-PPV polymer chain. It is important for choosing an
appropriate mapping for a coarse-grained model, as discussed in
sec. 4. By analyzing the distributions of the backbone dihedral
angles, we have concluded that the presence of the phenyl side
groups leads to chain conformations with opposite orientations
of alkyl side chains of neighboring repeat units, i.e. DP-PPV is
a syndiotactic polymer. In order to see the effect of solvent and
side chain length on correlations of monomer orientations, we
calculated the correlation function of a cross product of vectors
connecting the atoms 2–4 and 18–19 (see Fig. 1b for atom
designations). This cross-product, which is a measure of a chain
deviation from planarity, is shown in Fig. 5b. Again, within
available accuracy, our model cannot differentiate between

3.4 DP-PPV melt
An interesting observation made on the basis of WAXS experi-
ments is that, in a powder, DP6-PPV forms a p–p complex but
DP10-PPV does not.13 This conclusion was made by analyzing
WAXS profiles, which have a sharp maximum at 3 A in the case
of DP6-PPV, and ascribed to the distance between the p-stacked
phenyl rings. This maximum was absent in the DP10-PPV
powder. The difference in ring packing was explained in terms of
the bulkier side chains of DP10-PPV as compared to those of
DP6-PPV.
To capture the influence of the alkyl side chain length on
packing, we simulated a melt of DP-PPV oligomers. 64 oligomers
of 5 monomer units each were assembled on a regular lattice with

in both solvents, i.e. we could not capture the difference in
solvent quality. Longer side chains of DP10-PPV as compared to
DP6-PPV do neither affect phenyl ring packing in a melt nor
dimer-dimer interactions in vacuum and solution, as will be
shown in sec. 4.3. Hence, experimentally observed fractal
aggregates of DP6-PPV in chloroform or disk-like aggregates of
DP10-PPV in toluene, can not be rationalized by atomistic
models. However, reasonable agreement with experiments can be
expected for a dilute solution of DP10-PPV in chloroform, since
in this case no aggregation occurs. In the following section, we
will develop a solvent-free coarse-grained model of DP10-PPV in
chloroform.
4 Coarse-grained model
Coarse-graining is a systematic way of reducing the number of
degrees of freedom when representing a system of interest.
Coarse-grained models are computationally more efficient than
atomistic ones and are widely used to study phenomena which
occur on time- or length-scales not accessible to atomistic
simulations.8,43–48
As has already been pointed out in sec. 3, atomistic simulations
do not allow an accurate estimation of polymer persistence
lengths. Moreover, for studying dilute solutions of DP-PPV in
chloroform or toluene, systems with many chains have to be
simulated at different concentrations, which is practically
impossible at the atomistic level of detail.
In this section, we develop a solvent-free coarse-grained model
for DP10-PPV in chloroform and use it to calculate persistence
length and static structure factor as a function of polymer
concentration. Both are then compared to the experiment.
4.1 Mapping scheme
To represent a DP-PPV chain on a coarse-grained level, we
mapped two monomer units onto one spherical bead, as illus-
trated in Fig. 7d. Two (instead of one) monomer units per bead
were used because PPV is syndiotactic, as discussed in sec. 3.3.
Hence, a coarse-grained representation with one bead per repeat

PPV in chloroform was used for sampling. Potentials are obtained by Boltzmann-inverting the distributions. (c) Dimer-dimer potential of mean force
(PMF), calculated using configurational sampling. PMFs in toluene are identical to those in chloroform. (d) Mapping scheme for the coarse-grained
model. When determining centers of coarse-grained beads, no alkyl side chains were included.

discussed in sec. 3.2. The calculated persistence length of 25 
0.5 nm is independent of concentration, contrary to experimental
findings summarized in Table. 6. In experiments, persistence
length was extracted by fitting SANS profiles to the wormlike
chain model with excluded-volume interactions.14
The increase with concentration can be attributed to chain
aggregation. At low concentrations, chains do not interact and
there is no aggregation. Upon increasing the concentration,
aggregates start to form and inside those aggregates, chains
become locally more extended which increases their persistence
length. Our model can not capture this effect since we have
repulsive effective potentials. Hence, no driving force is present,
which might lead to polymer aggregation at higher concent-
rations.
5 Discussion and conclusions
In conclusion, a force-field for DP-PPV derivatives was para-
meterized and used to study side chain stretching, backbone
orientational correlations, tacticity, and planarity as well as the
influence of the side chain length on packing of backbones in
a melt. Atomistic simulations were also used to calculate poly-
mer-polymer solvent-mediated interaction potentials from which
solvent quality was estimated. Finally, a coarse-grained model
with two repeat units per bead was parameterized and used to
study the persistence length and static structure factor of dilute
solutions of poly(2,3-diphenyl phenylene vinylene) in chloroform
and toluene.
Our simulations confirm experimental evidence that both
chloroform and toluene are good solvents for DP-PPVs. This is
based on alkyl side chain stretching, backbone orientational
correlations, and the potential of mean force (PMF) of DP-PPV
dimers in the solvent. However, the experimentally reported
quantitative results on solvent quality could not be reproduced.
Atomistic simulations show that the difference in side chain
lengths of DP6- and DP10-PPV does not affect chain packing in
a melt of oligomers, which is practically identical for both DP6-
and DP10-PPV. Interdimer interactions in solutions are also not
strongly affected by the difference in side chain lengths, namely
the interdimer PMF is repulsive for both DP6- and DP10-PPV.
This seems to contradict experimental observations which find
that DP6-PPV forms aggregates in solution, whereas DP10-PPV
does not. A possible reason for this inconsistency might be that in
experiments, the system is in its non-equilibrium state, since
powder, in which polymer chains are semicrystalline, was used to
prepare the solution. Furthermore, as can be found in Ref. 14,
DP10-PPV does aggregate in toluene solutions. However, if the
system is heated up to 85 C and then cooled down, these
aggregates tend to disappear. Recently, an alternative explan-
ation of anomalous aggregation in good polymer solutions has
been proposed.52 This mechanism is applicable to stereoregular
polymers, such as DP-PPV, which indeed shown to be syndio-
tactic in our simulations.
Coarse-grained simulations show that, for very low polymer
concentrations (0.1–1.0 wt%), polymer persistence length does
not depend on polymer concentration. This again contradicts the
experimental picture, where the increase of persistence length at
1.0 wt% is rationalized as chain aggregation. The overestimation
of the polymer persistence length in simulations might be due to
the presence of tetrahedral chemical defects in real samples.53 In
these defects conjugated carbon-carbon bonds are replaced by
tetrahedral ones. They divide polymer chains into structurally
identifiable quasi-straight segments and reduce orientational
correlations, which leads to a decrease in persistence length.
Finally, we should mention that various approximations in
our simulation models might also lead to a disagreement between
experiments and simulations. For example, as experimental data
for conjugated compounds is rather sparse, force-field validation
becomes problematic. To this end, although we have reproduced
density, melting temperature, and crystal structure of stilbene,
this is no guaranty that thermodynamic properties such as
solvation free energy are correctly reproduced. Other issue can be
limited accessible length- and time-scales. Explicit solvents and
rather stiff polymer backbones prohibit the study of global chain
conformations and chain self-interactions via atomistic mole-
cular dynamics. Solvent-free coarse-grained models are capable
of simulating bigger boxes on longer timescales. These, however,
lead to additional approximations, which cannot be easily
controlled.

The electrostatic complexes of polyanionic DNA with dendrimers have been considered as a class of nonviral
vector for gene therapy. The gene transfection efficiency has been believed to be influenced by the structure of
the complex. In this study, we have systematically characterized the supramolecular structures of the complexes
of DNA duplexes with poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with generation two (G2) and three (G3) in
pure water using small-angle X-ray scattering. The structures were examined as a function of the charge density
of the dendrimer expressed by its degree of protonation (dp) and the molar ratio of the amine groups of dendrimer
to the phosphate groups of DNA (N/P). The DNA chains in all complexes under study were found to self-
organize into two-dimensional hexagonal or square lattice. In general, hexagonal phase was the favorable structure
for G2 complexes, while the DNA in G3 complexes tended to organize into a square lattice. Interesting transitions
between the columnar mesophases with respect to the changes of N/P ratio and dp have been identified. The
geometric features of the dendrimer molecules accommodated within the interstitial tunnels of the DNA lattices
have also been revealed. The B conformation of DNA was effectively retained in the complexes in spite of the
influence of the electrostatic interaction with the dendrimers.
Introduction
The electrostatic complexes of polyanionic DNA with various
cationic agents, including lipids, macrocations, polyelectrolytes,
and amphiphilic block copolymers, have received much attention
in recent years due to the effort in developing nonviral vectors
for gene therapy.1 The complexation is driven mainly by the
electrostatic attraction between DNA and the cationic species
coupled with the entropic gain from counterion release and it
usually results in significant aggregation of DNA chains, leading
to the formation of submicrometer-sized particles.2,3 Two levels
of the structure can hence be defined for the complexes: (1) the
“colloidal level” characterized by the topological feature (e.g.,
the shape and size) and the surface charge of the particles at
the length scale of several hundred nm or above; (2) the
“supramolecular level” characterized by the organization of
DNA chains and the cationic agent within the particles at the
characteristic length scale of several nm. It is believed that the
gene transfection efficiency is influenced by the structure of
the complex;4,5 consequently, resolving the structures at both
levels and the strategy for tuning them by various parameters
such as charge ratio, ionic strength, pH, and temperature have
been regarded as an important fundamental task for the
realization of effective nonviral gene vector.
The present study concerns the supramolecular structure of
the complexes of DNA with cationic dendrimers in pure water.
Dendrimer is a class of hyperbranched macromolecule compos-
ing of layers of monomer units irradiating from a central
core. 6,7 Each complete grafting cycle is called a “generation”
(denoted by Gn with n being the generation number). The
dendrimers possessing amine groups at the surface and/or the
interior can be protonated to controlled level under acidic
aqueous environment. The macrocations thus formed have been
considered as the carriers for macromolecular drug and gene
delivery. In recent years, the high-generation dendrimers have
been studied for pH-controlled drug delivery systems8 and as
gene delivery agents.9-14 Lower-generation dendrimers have
been investigated as a delivery system for plasmid DNA15,16
due to low cell cytotoxicity.
Due to the similarity in geometric feature between dendrimers
and histone protein,17-19 it was widely postulated that DNA
chain should coil around the cationic dendrimer upon complex-
ation, leading to the “beads-on-string” type of supramolecular
structure, as that found for DNA/histone complex constituting
the nucleosome particle.20 Recent simulation21,22 works have
revealed that the ability of a DNA chain to wrap around a
spherical macrocation and the resultant wrapping mode de-
pended on the balance among the electrostatic attraction, energy
cost of bending the DNA chain and the intrachain repulsion of
DNA. Tight wrapping around the macrocation enhances the
charge matching but increases the bending free energy; therefore,
the beads-on-string configuration may not be accessible for the
complexes with dendrimers of relatively low generations,
because the weaker electrostatic attraction (due to smaller charge
density of the dendrimer) may be outweighed by the high
bending energy cost for wrapping around the dendrimer
molecules with much smaller size than the persistence length
of DNA (ca. 50 nm in the absence of salt). Alternatively, the
complexation merely induces aggregation of the relatively
straightened DNA chains bridged by the dendrimer. The DNA
chains within the aggregates may attain certain degree of
orientational and positional order to reduce their excluded
volume interaction and to regulate the charge matching with

represents the ratio of the mean displacement of lattice points
to dDNA.29,30 For the convenience of discussion, we denote this
hexagonal phase without showing clear higher-order diffraction
peak as the “distorted hexagonal columnar phase” (DH).
Figure 1b shows dDNA as a function of N/P ratio. The
interhelical distance was obtained by multiplying the Bragg’s
spacing (2π/qm, with qm being the position of the primary
scattering peak) by 2/3. It can be seen that dDNA increased
progressively with increasing N/P, but it started to level off at
N/P ≈ 1.5. This implied that the actual composition of the
complex, that is, (N/P)a, reached a saturated value of (N/P)a ≈
1.5 when the prescribed N/P ratio exceeded 1.5. In other words,
nearly all DNA and dendrimer added for the complex prepara-
tion were consumed for complexation at the prescribed N/P ratio
of 1.5, and further increase of N/P did not add more dendrimer
into the complex. This was verified by the very low concentra-
tions of free DNA and free dendrimer remained in the
supernatant for the complex prepared with the prescribed N/P
of 1.5 (see Supporting Information).
The composition saturation was accompanied with a structure
transformation from DH phase to H phase. At low N/P ratio
where the supply of dendrimer was limited, all the dendrimer
macrocations were consumed for complexation with DNA. The
amount of dendrimer in the complex was however not sufficient
to “glue” the position- and orientation-fluctuating DNA chains
very cohesively, such that the hexagonal lattice underwent a
greater distortion by thermal fluctuations. Moreover, the G2
dendrimer molecules contained in the interstitial regions between
DNA tended to elongate along the longitudinal direction of DNA
to enhance the charge matching with DNA,31 and such an
elongational deformation led to a decrease of dDNA in the DH
phase (to be discussed in further detail later).
With the increase of N/P ratio the amount of dendrimer
accommodated within the complex also increased, but it
saturated as the prescribed N/P reached 1.5, where further
increase of N/P did not add more dendrimer into the complex.
In this case, the complexes with (N/P)a ≈ 1.5 were formed.
Here the amount of dendrimer accommodated in the complex
was sufficient to glue the DNA chains cohesively so as to yield
a more ordered hexagonal lattice. The saturated composition
corresponded well to the “isoelectric point” measured by the
zeta potential, where the surface charge of the complex particles
was fond to inverse from negative to positive at N/P ≈ 1.5.
Knowing the actual composition, that is, (N/P)a ≈ 1.5, for
the complexes showing H phase, it is possible to elucidate the
organization and the geometry of the dendrimer molecules
situating in the interstitial tunnels of the hexagonal lattice. The
number of phosphate groups of DNA allocated for one den-

contrast between dendrimer and water medium.28 This was
corroborated by the small angle neutron scattering (SANS)
result, where the SANS profiles of the G2 and G3 complexes
did not show discernible dendrimer-dendrimer correlation peak
although the SANS SLD contrast of the dendrimer (assuming
complete free of water) was 1.85 times that of DNA (see
Supporting Information).
Now we proceed to analyze the geometry of dendrimer
molecules accommodated in the hexagonal lattice. We assumed
that the pervaded volume of a dendrimer molecule was
represented by an ellipsoid with the half-lengths of the two axes
being a and c (with c being the rotating axis), as illustrated in
Figure 2a. Considering the 3-fold arrangement of dendrimer
molecules, dDNA in the hexagonal lattice is given by dDNAH )
31/2(a + RDNA) with RDNA () 1 nm) being the radius of DNA.
The value of c can then be calculated via c ) (3Vden)/(4πa2)
knowing the value of a and the volume of a PAMAM G2
molecule Vden ≈ 8.18 nm3.34 The values of a and c thus obtained
were about 1.15 and 1.48 nm, respectively, which prescribed
the aspect ratio of c/a ) 1.29. This supported our foregoing
postulate that the dendrimer molecules were elongated into
prolates along z axis to enhance the adhesion on the relatively
planar surface of DNA chain.
Figure 3a shows the SAXS profiles of DNA-G2 (dp ) 0.3)
complexes prepared with different N/P ratios. At N/P g 1.6
the presence of the two lattice peaks with the relative position
of 1:31/2 showed the formation of H phase. The primary peak
shifted to higher q and the 31/2 peak vanished at N/P ) 1.0,
signaling a significant distortion of the hexagonal lattice. The
corresponding variation of dDNA with N/P displayed in Figure
3b revealed an abrupt increase followed by leveling off at N/P
≈ 1.7. According to our foregoing discussion, this composition
was the saturated composition or (N/P)a of the complex showing
H phase. Assuming again the 3-fold arrangement of dendrimer
in the complex, the corresponding Dcc was 3.0 nm calculated
according to the following formula
where nph ) 30/(N/P)a ) 17.7.
Figure 4 presents the SAXS profiles and the N/P variation
of dDNA for the system with dp ) 0. It is interesting to note that
although no HCl was added to protonate G2 dendrimer here,
the complexation still took place spontaneously. A recent small
angle neutron scattering study by Chen et al. revealed that
PAMAM dendrimer only carried an extremely small amount
of positive charge in pure water (0.29 charge per molecule).35
Therefore, the hydrogen bonding between the primary amine
groups of PAMAM and the phosphate groups of DNA was
considered as the main binding force responsible for the
complexation.36,37 According to the SAXS profiles, the boundary
between H phase and DH phase was located at N/P ≈ 2.0 for
this series of complex; however, in contrast to the systems with
nonzero dp where the saturated composition defined the
boundary between these two structures, the corresponding dDNA
was found to increase rather smoothly with increasing N/P ratio
until it leveled off at N/P ≈ 6. We hypothesized that this N/P
ratio corresponded to the saturated composition; in this case,
the amount of dendrimer accommodated in the hexagonal lattice
was four times that in the complex prepared with dp ) 0.5. If
the dendrimer molecules still arranged in the 3-fold tunnels,

complex was constructed, as shown in Figure 8. The boundary
between H phase and DH phase was basically identified at the
(N/P) ratio at which the composition reached saturation () (N/
P)a) under a fixed dp of dendrimer.
c. Secondary Structure of DNA in the Complexes. DNA may
adopt different double helical conformations, including A-, B-,
C-, and Z-form, depending on the degree of hydration and ionic
concentration.39-41 The secondary structure is typically revealed
by circular dichroism (CD); however, such an identification
suffers the problem that the CD spectra may be perturbed by
the supramolecular structure formed in condensed DNA phase.
X-ray scattering is an alternative tool for identifying the
secondary structure based on the comparison between the
observed scattering pattern in the appropriate q range with those
calculated assuming the possible conformations. Figure 9
displays a series of the X-ray scattering curves in the high-q
region (ca. 4∼9 nm-1) of the complexes with (a) different N/P
ratios (dp fixed at 0.5) and (b) different dendrimer dps (N/P
fixed at 6.0). The scattering curves were found to display two
broad peaks situating at about 4.8 and 7.5 nm-1, irrespective of
N/P and dp. The observed scattering profiles were indeed
consistent with the calculated pattern of B-DNA obtained by
Mu¨ller.42 B conformation is the most common secondary
structure of DNA in the fully hydrated state. Our X-ray
scattering results indicated that the B conformation of DNA
was not perturbed by the electrostatic binding with dendrimer,
which was identical to our previous finding for the complexes
with PAMAM G4 dendrimer23 and also the results of Braun et

7.5 nm-1. The observed scattering patterns matched that of B-form DNA.

molecules due to the favorable hydrogen bonding. The saturated
composition of the complex displaying Sa phase was N/P )
2.7, which prescribed the Dcc of 4.03 nm. This distance was
already very close to the diameter of G3 dendrimer () 3.4 nm).
To accommodate more dendrimer molecules, the packing of
DNA transformed into a hexagonal lattice with the dendrimer
molecules placed in the 3-fold tunnels in accordance to the
arrangement in H’ phase found for G2 complexes (cf. Figure
5). Because dDNA in the H’ phase started to level off at N/P )
5.5, this composition was considered as the saturated composi-
tion of the H′-forming complexes. In this case, the corresponding
Dcc was 1.98 nm.
b. Effect of dp. Figure 14a presents the room temperature
SAXS profiles of DNA-G3 dendrimer complexes as a function
of dp (with N/P fixed at 6). At dp < 0.06, the complexes
displayed H′ phase and the structure transformed into S phase
at 0.075 < dp < 0.6. S and DS phase coexisted at 0.6 < dp <
0.65, and as dp exceeded 0.65, the observation of only a broad
correlation peak indicated that the majority of the DNA chains
packed in a distorted square lattice. The SAXS results hence
revealed the structure transformation from H to S phase and
finally to DS phase with increasing dp. Figure 14b revealed the
corresponding variation of the dDNA with dp. dDNA decreased
with increasing dp and showed clear transitions corresponding
to the transformations of the mesophases.
The geometric parameters of G3 dendrimer in the complexes
as a function of dp are listed in Table 2. Similar to G2 system,
G3 dendrimer was oblate in shape (aspect ratio < 1) at low dp
(dp < 0.068), and with the increase of dp, they were deformed
into prolates to enhance the charge matching. The observed
variation in the degree of dendrimer deformation was again
attributable to the interplay between the electrostatic repulsion
between the DNA chains and the electrostatic attraction between
dendrimer and DNA.
Figure 15 displays the morphological map of DNA-PAMAM
G3 complexes in terms of N/P and dp. Four types of columnar
phases were distinguished here, namely, H′ phase, saturated
square phase (Sa), unsaturated square phase (Sus), and distorted
square phase (DS). The boundaries between these structures
were drawn by he dashed lines.
Our SAXS results have revealed that in the cases where
ordered columnar phases were formed, the complexes of DNA

to elongate along the DNA longitudinal direction above moder-

andDden being the diameter of DNA (¼ 2 nm) and the dendrimer (¼
4 nm),13 respectively. Dden for the neutral dendrimer was adopted in
the calculation, as Brownian dynamics simulations revealed that the
radius of gyration of dendrimer in the dendriplex with linear poly-
electrolyte was close to that for the neutral state.4
For dendrimers in which the tertiary amine groups at the interior
were protonated (dp$ 0.6), the SAXS profiles of the corresponding
dendriplexes displayed a strong peak (qp) at ca. 2.3 nm
1 and
a vaguely identified peak (qd) at 1.251.45 nm1. The feature of the
scattering pattern was somewhat similar to that of chromatin,14,15
suggesting that the strong electrostatic attraction induced wrapping
of DNA around the dendrimer, yielding the ‘‘chromatin-like fiber’’
composing of the ‘‘nucleosome-like’’ units (Fig. 2c).
The formation of beads-on-string structure was verified by
comparing the observed SAXS profiles with the calculated form
factor of a chromatin-like fiber. We constructed a chromatin-like rod
formed by a DNA chain wrapping around a number of dendrimer
macrocations placed along a fiber axis (i.e., z axis) with an axial
interparticle distance of d (Fig. 2c). Each dendrimer was approxi-
mated to be a sphere with the internal monomer density fluctua-
tions,16 whilst the DNA superhelix was approximated by a uniform
helical cylinder with a prescribed pitch length P and helix radius Rh
(see ESI†).17 The wrapping was assumed to be tight; therefore, the
value of Rh may vary with z. Since d was normally larger than Dden,
a rodlike linker DNA was incorporated between two successive
nucleosome-like particles.18,19
After assigning the values of P and d, the system was divided into
numerous volume elements and the SAXS profile of the chromatin-
like fiber was calculated by the Debye equation20 (see ESI†). Fig. 3
compares the observed SAXS profile of the dp/0.9 complex with the
calculated ones (solid curves) for the chromatin-like fiber composed
of six nucleosome-like particles (P ¼ 2.95 nm and d ¼ 5.1 nm). The
uppermost curve corresponded to the case where the DNA superhelix
only contacted the surface of the dendrimer while wrapping around
it. This calculated profile showed a small lower-q peak and a stronger
peak, located at similar positions to those qd and qP peaks observed
experimentally. The position of qd was determined by the value of
d (i.e., qd ¼ 2p/d), while that of qp was determined by the value of P.
The qd peak was found to shift progressively to lower q with
increasing dp (Fig. 1), while qp peak moved slightly to higher q
(corresponding to a reduction of pitch length) when dp was increased
from 0.6 to 0.7, but it stayed invariant with further increase of dp. The
length of linker DNA was obtained by llink ¼ d  Dden; thus, llink
increased from 4A at dp¼ 0.6 to 12A at dp¼ 0.9. The observed llink
was smaller than that predicted by an analytical model.19
The calculated curve contained an additional peak at ca. 1.8 nm1
(qh) not observed clearly in the experimental profile. Previous simu-
lation studies have predicted quite consistently that a polyelectrolyte
chain can penetrate into the loose interior of the dendrimer while
wrapping around it.3–6 The effect of such a penetration on the
calculated SAXS profile is demonstrated in Fig. 3, where a series of
radial penetration depths (dpen) of DNA were further considered for
the calculation. It can be seen that qh shifted to higher q with
increasing dpen because the penetration reduced Rh of the DNA
superhelix, and it eventually merged with the qP peak. The fact that
the qh peak was hardly discernible in the experimental SAXS profiles
indicated that DNA did penetrate into the dendrimer while wrapping
around it and the penetration depth should be larger than 7 A.
The agreement between the observed SAXS profiles and the
calculated scattering curve assuming the beads-on-string structure
indicates that DNA was able to wrap around G4 dendrimer with
high charge densities (dp$ 0.6) as the strong electrostatic attraction
outweighed the DNA bending energy (or in other words, the chain
flexibility of DNA was enhanced by the eletrostatic attraction3,5,6).
The formation of such a structure in the G4 complex was consistent
with the recent theoretical prediction.19 The number of turns of DNA
helically-wrapped around a dendrimer molecule was estimated from
the ratio of Dden to P, which means that the DNA went one pitch

Abstract. The electrostatic complexes of polyanionic DNA with cationic dendrimer have been
considered as a potential non-viral vector for gene delivery and a model system for
understanding DNA-histone interaction. Although it is believed that the gene transfection
efficiency may be influenced by the structure of the complex, the supramolecular structure of
DNA-dendirmer complexes and its dependence on various system parameters such as
dendrimer generation number, charge density, charge ratio and ionic strength are not well
resolved. In this study, we investigate the structure of the complex of DNA with
polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer of generation nine (G9) by means of synchrotron small
angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). It is found that DNA is always able to wrap around the
dendrimer to yield the beads-on-string structure irrespective of the charge density of the
dendrimer. The effect of charge density on the persistence length of the chromatin-like fiber
thus formed and the pitch length of the DNA superheix wrapping around the dendrimer are
elucidated from the calculation of the SAXS profiles based on beads-on-string structure models.
The first section in your paper
1. Introduction
The electrostatic complexes of polyanionic DNA with various cationic agents, including lipids,
macrocations, polyelectrolytes and amphiphilic block copolymers, have received much attention in
recent years due to the effort in developing non-viral vectors for gene therapy. [1] The complexation
is driven mainly by the electrostatic attraction between DNA and the cationic species coupled with the
entropic gain from counterion release and it usually results in significant aggregation of DNA chains,
leading to the formation of submicrometer-sized particles. [2,3] Two levels of the structure can hence
be defined for the complexes: (1) the“colloidal level”characterized by the topological feature (e.g. the
shape and size) and the surface charge of the particles at the length scale of several hundred nm or
above; (2) the “supramolecular level”characterized by the organization of DNA chains and the
cationic agent within the particles at the characteristic length scale of several nm. It is believed that
the gene transfection efficiency is influenced by the structure of the complex; [4,5] consequently,
resolving the structures at both levels and the strategy for tuning them by various parameters such as
charge ratio, ionic strength, pH and temperature have been regarded as an important fundamental task
for the realization of effective non-viral gene vector.
The present study concerns the supramolecular structure of the complexes of DNA with cationic
dendrimer (called “dendriplexes”) in pure water. Dendrimer is a class of hyperbranched
macromolecule composing of layers of monomer units irradiating from a central core. [6] Each
dendrimer was obtained from DNT as methanol solutions. After thorough drying, the solids were
weighed and then redissolved in distilled water to produce a stock solution of 0.1% (w/w).The
solutions were stored at 4 °C till use.
2.2 Complex Preparation. To complex with the polyanionic DNA, the amine groups in PAMAM
dendrimer were first protonated by adding prescribed amount of 0.1 N HCl solution. The primary
amine groups at the outer surface of the dendrimer tended to be protonated first because their basicity
(pKa9.0) is larger than that of the interior teriary amines (pKa 5.8). [23] Therefore, the PAMAM
G9 dendrimers with different degrees of protonation (dp) were prepared by controlling the pH of the
solution. The solution of the protonated dendrimer solution was then mixed with the aqueous solution
containing prescribed amount of DNA to obtain the complex. The concentration of DNA aqueous
solution was 2 mg/ml. The complexaton was usually manifested by visually observable precipitation.
2.3 Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) Measurements. The supramolecular structures of the
complexes in pure water were probed SAXS at room temperature. The aqueous suspensions of the
complexes were directly introduced into the sample cell comprising of two ultralene windows. The
SAXS experiments were performed at the Endstation BL23A1 of the National Synchrotron Radiation
Research Center (NSRRC), Taiwan. The energy of X-ray source and sample-to-detector distance
were 14 keV and 2259 mm, respectively. The scattering signals were collected by MarCCD detector
of 512x512 pixel resolution. For the in-house experiment, the wavelength of X-ray source and sample-
to-detector distance were 0.154 nm (Cu) and 65 cm (for the low-q configuration) or 23 cm (for the
high-q configuration), respectively. The scattering intensity profile was output as the plot of the
scattering intensity (I) vs the scattering vector, q = (4/)sin(/2) (= scattering angle), after
corrections for sample transmission, empty cell transmission, empty cell scattering and the detector
sensitivity.
3. Results and discussion
The charge density of the PAMAM G9 dendrimer is
prescribed by its dp value which stands for the number fraction
of protonated amine groups in the dendrimer. The nominal N/P
ratio of the dendriplex, prescribed by the feed molar ratio of the
amine groups (irrespective of whether they are protonated) to
the phosphate groups of DNA, is fixed at 6/1.
Figure 1 displays the SAXS profiles of the dendriplexes
with three dp values for the G9 dendrimer. The scattering
patterns are very different from those associated with the
ordered columnar phases exhibited by the dendriplexes with
lower-generation dendrimers, [22] showing that DNA in the
complexes does not organize to form columnar mesophases.
For dp=0.02 and 0.1, the SAXS pattern is characterized by a
shoulder (marked by “qm”) near 0.05 Å-1, a small hump
(marked by “i=1”) at ca. 0.08 Å-1 and a large broad
shoulder/peak near 0.14~0.15 Å-1. When the dp is increased to
0.5, the SAXS profile displays a sharper primary peak and a
smal shoulder (marked by “i=1”) appearing like a form factor 
peak. An additional peak (marked by “qp”) is identified at 0.24 
Å-1.
Because the ordered columnar mesphase is not formed in
DNA/G9 complexes, we resort to another possible structure,
namely, the “beads-on-string” structure. A G9 dendrimer molecule (R = 59 Å) is 
Figure 1. Room-temperature
SAXS profiles of DNA-PAMAM
G9 ddendrimer complexes as a
function of dp. The nominal N/P
ratio of the dendriplexes is 6/1.
The chromatin-like fiber formed by
the complex should possess certain
persistence length. The fact that the
primary peak is broad and weak in
intensity at dp < 0.5 signals that the
axial correlation is limited and hence
the fiber has a relatively small
persistence length (or more flexible).
The primary peak becomes sharper and
more intense when dp is increased to
0.5, implying that the complex fiber
becomes stiff with large persistence
length. In this case, the charge density
of the dendrimer is very high (with
2048 charges on the surface), and a
significant amount of positive charges
remain unmatched even if DNA wraps
around the dendrimer tightly. The
complex is hence overcharged and the
strong electrostatic repulsion between
the overcharged nucleosome-like
particles stiffens the fiber significantly.
Moreover, the long-range correlation of
the pitches due to persistent wrapping
of DNA along the fiber axis leads to a relatively sharp and clear pitch peak located at ca. 0.24 Å -1. The
pitch length calculated from the peak position according to P = 2/qP is 2.6 nm. This value is slightly
larger than the diameter of DNA, showing that the DNA segments are closely spaced along the fiber
contour to effectively match the positive charges on dendrimer at the cost of bending energy.
The formation of beads-on-string structure by DNA-G9 dendrimer complexes is formally verified
by comparing the observed SAXS profiles with the calculated form factor of a chromatin-like fiber.
We construct a chromatin-like rod formed by a DNA chain wrapping around a number of dendrimer
macrocations placing along a fiber axis (i.e., z axis) with the axial interparticle distance of d (Figure 2).
Each dendrimer is approximated by a sphere with internal monomer density fluctuations, [25] and the
DNA superhelix is approximated by a uniform helical cylinder with a prescribed pitch length P and
pitch angle, as shown in Figure 3. The radius of the superhelix (Rh) given by Rh = P/(2tan) is
defined as the radial distance between the centerline and central trace of the helix (Rh = 0 for
completely straightened DNA, see Figure 3). Therefore, the helical trace of the cylinder can be
calculated from the following equations.[26]

where is phase angle that prescribes the direction of the groove of the superhelix. The regular
pitch of a helix can give rise to a scattering peak locating at qp = 2/lP = 2/Pcos, where lP is the
projection of P onto the normal of the helical segment (see Figure 3). It can be shown that qp ≈2/lP as
long as 2Rh is significantly larger than P. It is noted that the wrapping of DNA around the dendrimer
is assumed to be tight; therefore, the value of Rh may vary with z.
After constructing the chromatin-like fiber with prescribed values of P and d, we divide the
system into numerous volume elements (each with the size of 8 x 8 x 8 Å3) and the partial structure
factors associated with DNA-DNA correlation [SDD(q)], dendrimer-dendrimer correlation [Sdd(q)] and
Figure 4. Comparison between the experimentally
observed SAXS profile and the calculated SAXS pattern
for the dp/0.5 dendriplex. The SAXS profile is calculated
assuming a chromatin-like rod composing of 10
nucleosome-like particles placing in sequence with P=2.6
nm and d = 14 nm. The partial structure factors associated
with DNA-DNA and dendrimer-dendrimer correlation, i.e.
SDD(q) and Sdd(q), are also displayed. The figure on the
right shows the actual picture of the chromatin-like
segment generated for calculating the SAXS curves.
chromatin-like fiber and the peak marked by“i = 1”corresponds to the first form factor maximum of
the dendrimer. The peak observed at 0.24 Å-1 corresponds to the pitch peak found in the calculated
profile; therefore, the clear pitch peak in the observed SAXS profile attests a rather large persistence
length of the chromatin-like fiber and the pitch length of the DNA wrapping is 2.6 nm. Our present
calculation is however not rigorous enough to provide an accurate estimate of the persistence length.
For dendriplexes with lower dp, no clear pitch peak is identified and the corresponding SAXS
profiles in the high-q region display a broad shoulder. Moreover, the primary scattering peak is also
broad and relatively weak. These features attest that the persistence length of the chromatin-like fiber
is short. We found that the assumption of a monodisperse pitch length in the nucleosome-like
particles cannot produce the SAXS profile showing a broad high-q shoulder. On the other hand, the
assumption of polydisperse pitch length yields the SAXS pattern closely resembles the experimentally
observed profiles. Figure 5 displays the experimental SAXS profile of the complex with dp = 0.2 and
the SAXS profile calculated under the assumption of Gaussian distribution of the pitch length with the
mean value of 2.8 nm and the variance of 0.3 nm. In this case, the intensity at q > 0.05 Å-1 is obtained
by summing the form factor profiles of the nucleosome-like particles with different pitch lengths
according to the weighting prescribed by the Gaussian distribution function. The low-q intensity (q <
0.05 Å-1) is calculated for the chromatin-like rod composing of four nucleosome-like particles placed
in sequence with the interparticle distance of 11.8 nm. It can be seen that the agreement is fairly good,
thereby showing that the chromatin-like fiber formed by the dnedriplex with lower dp is more flexible
(comparing to that associated with dp/0.5 dendriplex) and there exists a relatively clear distribution of
pitch length of the DNA superhelix wrapping around the dendrimer.
4. Conclusion
We have revealed that DNA can wrap around PAMAM G9 dendrimer to yield the chromatin-like
structure irrespective of the charge density of the dendrimer. The wrapping mode of the nucleosome-
like particle and the global conformation of the chromatin-like fiber however depend on dendrimer
charge density. At low dp (< 0.5), DNA can still wrap around the dendrimer tightly with a distribution
of pitch length; the chromatin-like fiber thus formed has a smaller persistence length. At dp = 0.5, the
DNA chain wraps around the dendrimer regularly and tightly with the pitch length of 2.6 nm. The
resultant chromatin-like fiber is highly stiff due to strong electrostatic repulsion between the
nucleosome-like particles.

Background  
This project centers on the self-assembly behavior of semiflexible polymers bearing 
specific interaction groups to form special aggregates or supramolecular assemblies with 
themselves or other macromolecules with complementary binding groups.  The systems under 
study include (1) DNA (bearing anionic phosphate groups) capable of forming electrostatic 
complexes with cationic dendrimers for mimicking DNA-histone complexes and for 
applications as non-viral vectors for gene therapy, and (2) semiflexible conjugated polymers 
(bearing  interaction groups) for opto　 -electronic applications.  Experimental techniques 
including small angle X-ray and neutron scatterings (SAXS and SANS), TEM and AFM have 
been utilized for the structure characterizations.  Multi-scale computer simulation scheme has 
been or will be developed where for different length and time scales different methods have 
been used.  This scheme will be used to predict the structures formed under the prescribed 
experimental conditions.   
Through this project, we have effectively established the reciprocal space characterization 
techniques using SAXS and SANS; however, the real-space technique for direct observation of 
the morphology is still under intensive development.  The objective of this trip to the Physics 
Department of Moscow State University is to learn the application of AFM in characterizing the 
nanostructures of DNA-dendrimer complexes through interaction with Prof. I. Yaminsky’s 
laboratory which specializes in the application of AFM to soft matter.   
 
Experimental 
Materials. The DNA used for preparing the dendriplexes for supramolecular structure 
characterizations was a linear DNA from calf thymus purchased from MP Biomedicals. 
PAMAM G6 dendrimer with a diaminobutane (DAB) core (polydispersity index < 1.01) in 
ethanol solution was acquired from Dendritic Nanotechnologies (Mount Pleasant, MI, USA). 
After thoroughly drying, the solid was redissolved in distilled water to produce a 0.2% (w/v) 
stock solution. The solutions were stored at 4 °C till use.  
 
Preparation of dendriplexes. All dendriplexes were prepared at room temperature (ca. 27 oC).  
Dendrimers with different average degrees of protonation (dp) were prepared by adding 
predetermined amounts of 0.01 N HCl into the aqueous solutions. The values of dp were 
determined from the pH (measured by an ISTEK Model 720P pH meter) of the protonated 
dendrimer solutions.1 The dendriplexes were prepared by pouring the prescribed amount of 0.2 
% (w/v) solution of calf thymus DNA into the 0.2% (w/v) protonated dendrimer solution. The 
complexation was usually manifested by precipitation. The dendriplexes were left at room 
temperature for 16 h for equilibration.   
 
For AFM observation, we coated a thin layer of dendriplex sample over a mica surface. After 
24 hours, we rinsed the residual solution on the mica surface by using deionic water.

causes by a complex of generation 4 dendrimer with DNA. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 are the AFM image 
of generation 4 dendrimer-DNA complexes with dp equals 0.7. In this image, the light-colored 
regions are less than the AFM image which the dp equals 0.9, and the average height of this 
smaple is around 2.6 nm. According to the shape of these light-colored regions are all similar 
and just like a sphere, therefoer, we assume this phenomenon is due to the single complex. Since 
the dp of dendrimer is lower, the flexibility may become larger, and makes the dendrimer 
smaller than in natural state in AFM image while using the tapping mode. 
 
Conclusion 
 According to the AFM images of both dendrimer-DNA complexes, we can see a lot of 
globularity pattern on the surface, which means that the concentration of the complexes is too 
high. Consequently, the concentration must be lower in the next time, may be around 10 ng/g. 
Besides that, there is a problem is that whether the dendrimer with positive charge on the surface 
will deform under the tapping mode of AFM. If yes, then we have to find out what the degree of 
deformation is. These questions should be realized before analysing the AFM image in the 
future. Finally in this article, althought there is no clearly image of the beads-ona-string 
structure of dendrimer-DNA complexes, we still colud say that the morphology structures of 
DNA-G9 complexes are affected by concentration, dp and substrate indeed.

     First, we modulate the degree of protonation (dp) of G6 dendrimer which dissolves in 
water solution by 0.1 N HCl solution to control their charge.  Second, we mix the dendrimer 
solution with DNA solution.  The overall composition of all complexes is x = 6 (surface amine 
groups/ DNA base pairs).  The DNA concentrations of the complexes are 100 ng/ml and 1 　
g/ml, respectively.  One substrate (mica) is used to adsorbe the complex. Finally, the complex 
solution is dropped onto the mica 30, 60, and 120 minutes then, rinsed by water.   
     
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements. 
The AFM experiments were conducted using a Multimode AFM with 
Nanoscope IIIA Controller (Digital Instruments, USA) in tapping mode 
with a typical scan rate of 1 Hz. The measurements were performed in 
air in tapping mode using sharp silicon cantilevers NSG01 (NT-MDT, 
Russia) with a guaranteed tip radius of 10 nm. The cantilever typical 
force constant was 5.1N/m and typical resonance frequency was 150 kHz. 
 
Results and Discussions 
First we want to find the good conditions to prepare samples for AFM experiment. So that 
we compared several possibilities that would be affect the AFM images quality. For example, 
concentration, substrate, method of coating, coating time, type of tip, experimental skills, etc. 
Because of the negative charge on the mica surface and the complexes we prepared are almost 
positive charge. So that mica is the best choice to be the substrate. We prepared the final DNA 
concentration in 10, 100, and 1000 nanogram per milliliter. The concentration is fixed in 100 
ng/ml is enough for observing the AFM results. Figure 1 to figure 3 are show the AFM 
topographic image of DNA-PAMAM G6 complex at N\P = 6 with dp = 0.7, drop cast on the 
Mica surface for 30, 60, 120 min. The final DNA concentration is 100 ng/ml. We can find the 
quality and the dispersed on the images are almost similar. So that we could ascertain just put 
the samples on the mica surface more than 30 min in enough to get good images. We also could 
25 
modulate the dp, concentration, prepare skill etc. to control the formation try to observe 
beads-on-string model.   With increasing dp, the DNA-G6 complex is in the wrapped states 
due to strong electrostatic attraction.

Abstract 
In this study, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate morphology 
of the organic photovoltaics (OPVs) conjugated polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ), 
the popular BHJ blend of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and 
[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The solution structure and its 
correlation with film morphology have not been studied in detail. We assert that there 
should exist a “solution phase-controlled thin-film morphology” effect, where the 
structures of the conjugated polymer and the acceptor materials in the solution state 
are to some extent transferred to the film. Our focus in this study was to describe the 
growth of spherical or rod-like P3HT/PCBM structures in thin films and to control the 
morphologies that resulted from the interchain interactions with the aim of enhancing 
two-dimensional molecular ordering in P3HT/PCBM thin films. 
 
Materials and methods 
Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT, RR >98.5 %, its number-average 
molecular weight and polydispersity index were 50,000 g/mol and 2, respectively) 
and [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, >99.5 %) was purchased from 
UniRegion Bio-Tech. These were respectively dissolved in xylene. The two solutions 
were mixed in different ratios of 1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2 (P3HT:PCBM) by stirring their 
mixtures at 70 ℃ for 2 h. The warm P3HT and P3HT/PCBM solution were cooled to 
room temperature and characterized at regular time intervals (0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h, 
all aging process of solution and preparation of polymer thin films have been 
performed in the room). These mixtures were respectively spin-casting (3000 rpm, 50 
sec) onto Si wafers of size of 12 mm by 12 mm, and dried different annealing 
temperature (room temperature, 130 ℃ and 150 ℃) for 20 min in oven. Before 
spin-casting, the Si wafers were cleaned in solvent (H2SO4/H2O2, DI water, 
isopropanol and acetone). The real-space morphologies of the thin films cast from 
freshly prepared solution and the gel state were observed using tapping model. 
 
Results and Discussion 
In order to observe the morphology growth much clearly, we have used the AFM 
to observer the morphology structure of P3HT and P3HT:PCBM composite thin films 
with different annealing treatment. Influence of aging time conditions on the 
topography for the investigated P3HT and P3HT:PCBM thin films on Si substrates. 
The different conditions of topography and the fibril structure in the AFM phase 
image for varied aging time and annealing temperature. The image dimensions are 2.5
μm × 2.5μm and 5μm × 5μm.

Results and Discussion 
 In this report, we intend to investigate the morphology of the generation 6 dendrimer-DNA 
complexes by using AFM. Since the size of generation 6 dendrimer is similar with the histone 
protein in the nucleosome, we are looking forward to the dnedrimer-DNA complexes will form 
the similar structure of chromatin. Therefore, after using AFM to get the preliminary results, we 
could know what the structure real is, and utilize these results to try to simulate the chromatin 
regulation in the future. In order to simulate the nucleosome structure, we are going to confirm 
the structure of a bead, a dendrimer-DNA complex, is the same as the structure of nucleosome, 
for this reason, we prepared the generation 6 dendrimer-DNA complexes by using the specific 
length DNA (190 bp). 
 
 Fig. 1 to Fig. 5 are the AFM images of generation 6 dendrimer-DNA complexes within 
different degree of protonation, and the mode of AFM is tapping mode. Fig. 1 to Fig. 3 are AFM 
images of dendrimer-DNA complexes with degree of protonation equals 0.7. In Fig. 1, we 
compare the Height image and Phase image together, then we could know that whethe the 
difference of height in Height image is due to our polymer (soft matter) or just because of the 
defect on the surface. Here we can see that the globularity patterns with higher height are at 
almost the same position; that means the globularity patterns are on account of our complexes. 
The same result could be seen at Fig. 4. In Fig. 2 and Fig.3, there are two kinds of height in the 
height image; one is the height around 6 nm, the other one is around 14 nm. For generation 6 
dendrimer, the diameter is around 6 nm, and the diameter is around 2 nm. But when under the 
tapping mode measurment, the height will be decreased, [4]; the DNA diameter will be 
deformed from 2 nm to 0.6 ~ 0.8 nm.[5] Therefore, the lower height of the image in Fig. 2, is 
consider as the dendrimer-DNA complexes, but the height of the other Figure, Fig. 3, the height 
is higher, around 16 nm. For this phenomenon, it is may be cause of the dendrimer-DNA 
complexes aggregated together. 
 
 For Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, these images are the dendrimer-DNA complexes with dp equals 0.5. 
The Fig. 4 has been discussion above that is the major globularity patterns are due to ours 
sample, not due to the defect on the surface. In Fig. 5, the average heigh of the image is around 
2 nm, it is a quite small value. The possible explanation is the dnedrimer with lower dp may 
have more flexibility, thus when using the tapping mode, the dendrimer may be compressed to 
around 1 nm in diameter. Hence the kind of this height will be possible to emerge. 
 
 With regard to the generation 4 dendrimer-DNA in different degree of protonation systems. 
Fig. 6 to Fig. 9 are the AFM image of these complexes with dp equals 0.7 and 0.9. For Fig. 6 
and 7, the condition of this sample is with dp equals 0.9. There are a lot of light-colored region 
with the height are around 0.6 nm, which we consider it is due to the pure DNA. However, there 
is a bright spot on the image, and the height is about 5.5 nm. Considering the diameter of 
generation 4 dendrimer (4.3 nm, naturally) and diameter of pure DNA, this bright spot may be

Using Atomic Force Microscopy(AFM) observe structure of DNA-PAMAM G6 complexes 
Introduction 
Dendrimer is a special class of byperbranched macromolecule composed of layers of 
monomer units irradiating from a central core. Each complete grafting cycle is called a 
‘‘generation’’.1-2  Higher generation dendrimers have been considered as artificial proteins 
owing to their systematic and dimensional length scaling properties.3  In general, DNA 
complexation with histones results in a beads-on-string structure.4  From a fundamental point 
of view, the mechanism of DNA compaction is a challenging problem.  We know that histone 
possesses charge   +200 e.5  Although the G9 dendrimer have 2048 amine groups, the degree 
of protonation of dendrimers can be tuned by HCl to control their charge.  Kunze et. al also 
speculates the wrapped state depending on the chares of sphere in simulation.6  For lower 
charge, the DNA-sphere complex is in the dewrapped state.  With increasing charge of 
dendrimer, DNA chains can be wrapped around histone due to strong electrostatic attraction.  
By controlling the charge of dendrimers, we can explore the mechanism of the formation of the 
wrapped state by AFM.  
 
Experiment sections 
Materials. 
Linear Calf Thymus DNA was purchased from ICN and used without further purification. Its 
molecular weight was ca. 9.2k bps. Ethylenediamine (EDA) core poly(amido amine) G6 
dendrimers were obtained from DNT as methanol solutions. Two substrates (mica and modified 
mica with crystal violet (CV-mica)) are used.  We parepared the crystal violet solution with 
concentration of 0.35 Mm.  The solution is dropped onto mica surface for 30 mins and then 
rinsed by water.  
 
Preparation of samples.

find several size of global structure on the AFM images. Figure 4 indicate the sizes of different 
global structure are from 30nm to 576 nm. The range of the large scale size of those complexes 
is so large. The complexes ratio (N/P) looks like change in such dilute solution. We can observe 
from small size to large size in one sample. The concentration of the complexes will affect the 
structure of the complexes in the same conditions. Figure 5 and figure 6 the large global and 
small global sizes are more clearly to observe. We find a special image in top side of figure 5. 
That structure looks like a sphere and more condensations observed in the center. The middle of 
figure 5 the complexes look like a cobweb. We also observe the rod like structure in the left 
down side. Figure 7 and figure 8 show the height of the complexes. The height of the single 
DNA on mica surface is almost 0.6 to 1 nanometer, and the height of the single dendrimer G6 on 
the mica surface is about 0.6 nanometer. Because of the samples are drily on the mica surface so 
that the diameter of the dendrimer is less than the original diameter. From the height information 
of the AFM results we can prove the single dendrimer adhere on a single DNA. Those look like 
beads on the necklace.  
DNA is kind of worm like chain so that the persistent length of single DNA is about 50 
nanometer. We try to analyze the persistent length of the complexes. From the figure 9 and 
figure 10, we observed the persistent lengths of those complexes are 37 and 41 nanometer 
respectively. In our opinion the persistent lengths of DNA become smaller after complexes 
because of the DNA itself exclude interaction become weaker. The positive charges from the 
dendrimer neutralize the negative charge from DNA. We can confirm DNA become soft after 
complexes. 
Conclusions 
The morphology structures of DNA-G6 complexes are affected by concentration, coating time 
and substrate. We find the good conditions to prepare the AFM samples such as using mica to be 
substrate and fixed the final DNA concentration in 100 ng/ml. The sizes of the global complexes 
have large range because of the concentration of the complexes affect the complexes ratio. We 
also make sure the persistence length of DNA become smaller after complexes. Finally, we can

Interdiction 
Polymer crystallization induced by π–π stacking, alkyl side-chain interactions, 
and solubility changes allows for an increase of conjugation length and for efficient 
charge transport.1 Among crystallinity defines the degree of long-range order in a 
material, and strongly affects its properties. The more crystalline a polymer, the more 
regularly aligned its chains. These materials can be applied in optoelectronic devices 
such as polymer light-emitting diodes and solar cells.2, 3 The outlook that lightweight 
and flexible polymer solar cells can be produced by roll-to-roll production, in 
combination with high energy-conversion efficiency, has stimulated a global interest 
in these novel photovoltaic devices.4-6 Furthermore, polymer self-assembly is 
decoupled from the coating process and can be optimized through controlled changes 
in temperature and solvent quality.7 The crystalline wires generated in the solution 
may be transferred to the film upon quick solvent removal. The photovoltaic devices 
with P3HT nanowire morphology was found to exhibit much higher power 
conversion efficiency (PCE) than those with disordered morphologies.8, 9 
Previously, we have shown that gelation of P3HT/xylene solution occurs upon 
aging at room temperature and the gelation is driven by the formation of P3HT 
nanowires in the solution. The present work focuses on characterizing the nature of 
the network structures that arise from the colloidal self-assembly of P3HT:PCBM 
blends with different blend ratios in xylene solvent. Understanding the mesoscopic 
structure of the network is critical to further optimize charge transport and to improve 
the performance of OFETs and OPV devices. 
 
identical spin-casting after aging of the solution. As the P3HT solution aging time 
increased, more thick nanowires were step by step observed to form. Fig. 7 shows 3D 
topography images of P3HT thin films. After 48 h aging of the P3HT films without 
annealing has a very smooth surface. After 20 min of annealing at 150 ℃, the 
roughness of the film increased a little as aging time 48 h. The P3HT aggregates 
formed rod-like structures as the aging time increased further.  
Fig. 8 - 25 show select AFM results of the P3HT:PCBM composite thin films 
obtained under identical spin-casting after aging of the solution. We observed a gel 
time of the mixture delay to add PCBM. Nanowire Of P3HT:PCBM blend solution 
formed as increase time. In addition, the PCBM material of this polymer aggregated 
into solution system, leaving the P3HT tails exposed to provide stability in this 
solvent as long time. Fig. 20 shows 3D topography images of P3HT:PCBM blend thin 
films. The surface roughness increased with increasing annealing temperature, and 
then it became very rough after 48 h of aging time. 
 
 
Conclusions 
The surface roughness increases with increasing aging time, and then it becomes 
very rough after 20 min of annealing. Fresh solutions of P3HT produced 
near-spherical particles at short aging times, and P3HT exhibited one-dimensional 
growth into rod-like structures with lengths of up to several microns as increased the 
aging time. The rough surface is due to the aggregation of PCBM. PCBM inhibit the 
aggregation P3HT after blend. Aging time increased to 48 hours can be seen 
nanowire.
