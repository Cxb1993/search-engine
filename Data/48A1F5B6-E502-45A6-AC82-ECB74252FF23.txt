本研究以快速熱退火法(RTA)成長 SiO2 奈米線，利用場發式掃描電子顯微鏡法(FE-SEM)、高解
析穿透式電子顯微鏡法(HRTEM)、高角度環形暗視野影像(HAADF)、電子能量損失譜儀(EELS)
以及能量過濾穿透式電子顯微鏡法(EFTEM)來研究 SiO2奈米線的材料特性。結果 HAADF 影像
顯示奈米線末端具有較明亮的對比，推測為 Pt，而在 EFTEM 和 EELS 中的元素圖譜顯示出此奈
米線含有 Si 及 O 元素。SiO2奈米線在 HRTEM 的影像中顯示為非結晶態且無特徵對比，並發現
此奈米線之長度與直徑取決於與 Pt 薄膜的初始厚度。利用 RTA 成長 SiO2奈米線能達到每分鐘
大於 1 µm 的高成長速率，提供了一個大面積製造奈米線的方法。 
 
一、 前言 
一維奈米結構無論是在基礎研究或是工業應用上都非
常重要，這是由於它在新科技的發現與發展上擁有相當好的
潛力。在一些製備奈米線的不同方法中，金屬觸媒奈米粒子
在成核尺寸的控制與後續一維晶體的成長上往往是不可或
缺的，早已有許多團隊研究出各種以金屬觸媒生長奈米線的
各種不同的生長技術。而其中最廣為人知的就是氣相-液相-
固相(VLS)法，此方法最早是在 1960 年代由貝爾實驗室的
Wagner 與 Ellis 所提出[1]，他們把金屬奈米粒子被用來當做
在 VLS 期間控制成核成長與奈米線伸長量的觸媒使用。這
個過程開始是由氣體在熔融的金屬觸媒上達到飽和導致連
續性的析出而形成奈米線。 
近來，吳等人利用臨場透射電鏡觀測術(in-stu TEM) 直
接觀測了 VLS 法成長奈米線的反應過程，清楚說明了 VLS
法的反應行為[2]，並且觀察到奈米線可以在低於共晶溫度
下成長。也就是說，奈米線可以用固相觸媒來成長，氣相-
固相-固相(VSS)機制說明了在奈米線成長期間金屬觸媒不
需要超過其熔點溫度[3,4]。奈米線的成長在一些情況可以不
需要金屬晶種的存在，比如說在氧氣中或是在基板上做遮罩
[5,6]。 
近來低維度奈米結構在光學應用方面被大量地研究。
SiOx奈米線被發現可以發出紅光[7]、綠光[8]、藍光[7,9-12]
以及紫外光[7]。此發光的機制跟氧缺陷有關[7]。製造 SiOx
奈米線的方法相當多，但是利用 RTA 的方式製造奈米線的
例子相當少見，RTA 的好處是它具有較低的熱預算(thermal 
budget)，而且 RTA 所需持溫時間也比爐管短的多。本實驗
以 Pt 為觸媒，利用 RTA 的方式成長奈米線，並分析 SiO2
奈米線的結構與特性。 
 
二、 實驗方法 
首先利用熱氧化的方式在 p-type 的 Si(100)基板上成長
一層厚度為 11 nm 的 SiO2薄膜，然後用熱蒸鍍機在 SiO2 基
板上沉積各為 15、30 和 50 nm 的 Pt 薄層，接著將 Pt/SiO2/Si
結構的試片置於 900oC 充滿 N2的 RTA (JetFirst 100 RTP, 
JIPelec)中 60 秒，此時 N2的流量為 50 sccm。我們用 FE-SEM
檢測其表面形態，利用裝有能量過濾器(GIF, GIF 2000, 
Gatan)及 HAADF 偵測器的場發式 HRTEM (Tecnai-F20, FEI 
Ltd.)研究奈米線的結構，並且用電子能量損失光譜(EELS)，
以及能量過濾穿透式電子顯微鏡法(EFTEM)推斷出組成成
分分佈。 
 
三、 結果與討論 
    圖1是以HRTEM在Si基板上[110]方向觀察Pt/SiO2/Si
結構的橫斷面圖。圖中可以看見 SiO2薄膜為 11 nm 且為非

Abstract In this work, we demonstrate a fast approach to
grow SiO2 nanowires by rapid thermal annealing (RTA).
The material characteristics of SiO2 nanowires are investi-
gated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM),
high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging, electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and energy-filtered TEM
(EFTEM). The HAADF images show that the wire tip
is predominantly composed of Pt with brighter contrast,
while the elemental mappings in EFTEM and EELS spec-
tra reveal that the wire consists of Si and O elements. The
SiO2 nanowires are amorphous with featureless contrast
in HRTEM images after RTA at 900°C. Furthermore, the
nanowire length and diameter are found to be dependent
on the initial Pt film thickness. It is suggested that a high
SiO2 growth rate of >1 µm/min can be achieved by RTA,
showing a promising way to enable large-area fabrication of
nanowires.

1 Introduction
One-dimensional nanostructures are important for both fun-
damental research and industrial applications, due to their
promising potential for discoveries of new sciences and the
development of novel technologies. Among different prepa-
ration methods for nanowires, metal catalytic nanoparticles
are sometimes the prerequisites for the dimensionally con-
fined nucleation and the subsequent one-dimensional crystal
growth. Numerous studies of the growth of metal-catalyzed
nanowires have been investigated by different groups using
various growth techniques. The well-known mechanism for
nanowire growth is the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) process.
The VLS mechanism was first proposed by Wagner and
Ellis at Bell Labs in the early 1960s [1]. Metal nanoparti-
cles can be used as catalysts during the vapor–liquid–solid
growth to control the nucleation and subsequent elongation
of the nanowire. The introduction of process gases causes
the saturation of the molten metal catalyst, leading to contin-
uous precipitation of the nanowire. Recently, Wu and Yang
demonstrated direct observation of VLS nanowire growth
by in situ transmission electron microscopy, which makes
clear the VLS growth behavior [2]. In addition, the nanowire
has also been observed to grow below the eutectic tempera-
ture. That is, the nanowire can also be grown from solid cat-
alysts. The vapor–solid–solid (VSS) mechanism indicates
that the metal catalyst does not need to exceed the melting
temperature during the nanowire growth [3, 4]. Furthermore,
nanowires can also be grown without a metal seed particle,
for example in the presence of an oxide or by masking a
substrate [5, 6].

the Pt/SiO2/Si structure

nanowires grown after rapid thermal annealing at 900°C for 60 s
In order to understand the chemical composition distribu-
tion in the nanowires, the cross-sectional TEM samples were
used in this study. Figure 3a shows the HAADF image of the
nanowires with particles on the tips. It is known that scan-
ning this sub-nanometer electron probe on samples with a
simultaneous collection of the incoherent thermal scattering
electrons at high angles can lead to the formation of HAADF
imaging and the intensity of the HAADF imaging mode is
approximately proportional to the square of the atomic num-
ber (Z1.6−2) [30, 31]. Following this theory, a higher atomic
number (Z) element will show stronger contrast, due to the
higher angle scattering, than a lower Z element. The par-
ticles on the tips of nanowires reveal brighter contrast in
Fig. 3a, indicating that the particles have larger atomic num-
ber such as Pt (atomic number Z = 78). In order to real-
ize the composition of nanowires, the elemental mapping in
Fig. 3 (a) High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image of SiO2
nanowires containing particles on the tips of the wires. (b) Elemen-
tal mapping of the Si L2,3-edge in energy-filtered transmission elec-
tron microscopy (EFTEM) images of SiO2 nanowires. (c) The EELS
spectra of the region on the particle bottom with arrow in (b), SiO2
nanowires and Si substrate as a reference
EFTEM was performed. The three-window method, using
two pre-edge images (extrapolated background above the
ionization edge) and one post-edge image (positioned at the
ionization edge), was used to extract this information [26].

nanowire. However, the ELNES spectrum acquired at the
position between the particle and the nanowire (see arrow
in Fig. 3b) reveals a similar ELNES spectrum of the Si sub-
strate. The small amount of the Si precipitates between Pt–Si
particles and SiO2 nanowires may play a role in the growth
mechanism of SiO2 nanowires.
Figure 5 shows the HRTEM image of the interface be-
tween Pt–Si particles and SiO2 nanowires. It is found that
crystalline Si precipitates exist between the Pt–Si particles
and SiO2 nanowires, which agrees well with the ELNES
spectrum in Fig. 3c. Figure 6 shows the TEM images of the
SiO2 nanowires along the [110] projection of the Si sub-
strate. The enlarged region with the square mark in Fig. 6a
is shown in Fig. 6b. No lattice image is observed in the
nanowire, indicating that the nanowire is amorphous.
The point of the VLS growth is to use the liquid-state
metal alloy particles as catalysts. In our case, the SiO2
nanowires use Pt–Si nanoparticles as catalysts, and the liq-
uid Pt–Si particles maintain constant Si concentrations in a
thermodynamically balanced vapor–liquid–solid system so
that the growth occurs when the SiO vapor is supplied. Dur-
ing RTA, only the N2 gas with a flow rate of 50 sccm was
introduced into the chamber. Therefore, the Si source for the
nanowire growth is possibly from the SiO2/Si. It is reported
that annealing of SiO2/Si film stacks will lead to the forma-
tion of gaseous SiO at temperatures above 800°C [17, 33]:
Si(s) + SiO2(s) → 2SiO(g).
Si and O atoms in the SiO2/Si film stacks will form volatile
silicon monoxide (SiO) at high temperature, which escapes
to the ambient. As a result, the SiO desorbing from the 11-
nm-thick SiO2 thin film is possibly the Si source for the
SiO2 nanowire growth. Besides, other sources of oxygen
may come from the residual oxygen in the chamber or a
trace amount of H2O and O2 in the carrier gas of N2, which
can supply a constant oxygen source during the growth of
SiO2 nanowires. The presence of a trace amount of H2O and
O2 is not expected to significantly change the Pt–Si phase di-
agram, but in the meanwhile it may act as the oxygen source
during the silicon oxide growth.
Figure 7 is a schematic drawing representing the growth
model of SiO2 nanowires by rapid thermal annealing. The
growth scenario of the SiO2 nanowires is proposed as fol-
lows. First, a Pt/SiO2/Si multilayer structure has been fabri-
cated. Second, the Pt layer starts to agglomerate and forms
nanoparticles on the SiO2 surface, due to its high surface
tension, after RTA at high temperature. Third, the Pt–Si
nanoparticles act as nucleation sites and are responsible for
initiating and guiding the growth of SiO2 nanowires. Based
on the vapor–liquid–solid process, the SiO vapor is incor-
porated into the growing nanowire by means of a droplet of
liquid catalyst. The SiO undergoes a chemical reaction to
give SiO2 and Si, and they will further be oxidized to form
SiO2 nanowires. The reaction can be described as follows
[14, 19]:
2SiO(g) → SiO2(s) + Si(s),
SiO2(s)+Si(s) + O2(g) → 2SiO2(s).
The SiO2 and Si are possibly the two sources to sustain the
growth of SiO2 nanowires. Due to the low solubility of SiO2
in Pt, the SiO2 diffuses to the bottom of the droplet and con-
denses to form the SiO2 on the lower hemispherical surface
of the Pt–Si droplet. On the other hand, the Si atoms may
dissolve into the droplet. When the concentration of dis-
solved Si atoms in the Pt–Si droplet reaches its solubility,
the Si content in the Pt–Si alloy is saturated [27]. As the Pt–
Si solution becomes supersaturated, the Si atoms will pre-
cipitate, which is identified by the EELS spectrum (Figs. 3b
and c). The Si precipitates then react with an additional oxy-
gen source to form SiO2 nanowires. The mechanism is pre-
sented in Fig. 8. The additional oxygen source may come
from (1) the residual oxygen in the reaction chamber and
(2) the leakage of the RTA system. Because our RTA system
is not a high-vacuum system, the presence of residual oxy-
gen is unavoidable. Besides, even though the chamber pres-
sure is higher than the outside ambient (760 Torr), a small
amount of oxygen may be introduced into the chamber. Due
to the presence of the additional oxygen source in the an-
nealing ambient, the nanowire is further oxidized and the
