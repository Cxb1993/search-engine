ABSTRACT 
This paper proposes a statistical confidence interval based 
model updating approach for the health diagnosis of structural 
systems subjected to seismic excitations.  The proposed model 
updating approach uses the 95% confidence interval of the 
estimated structural parameters to determine their statistical 
significance in a least-squares regression setting.  When the 
parameters’ confidence interval covers the “null” value, it is 
statistically sustainable to truncate such parameters.  The 
remaining parameters will repetitively undergo such parameter 
sifting process for model updating until all the parameters’ 
statistical significance cannot be further improved.  This 
newly developed model updating approach is implemented for 
the developed series models of multivariable polynomial 
expansions: the linear, the Taylor series, and the power series 
model, leading to a more accurate identification as well as a 
more controllable design for system vibration control.  
 
INTRODUCTION 
System identification for structural health monitoring and 
damage detection in civil structures is moving to the forefront 
of worldwide research activities.  Such monitoring and 
detection for buildings and bridges is important for the public 
safety related to natural disasters such as earthquakes, and is 
also becoming increasingly important because of the aging of 
infrastructure systems.  
The methods for health monitoring and damage detection 
develop linear models from data, and are applicable to a large 
class of civil structures, but the linear property limits the use 
[1].  It is required to generate methods to create mathematical 
models that are nonlinear, to assist in damage assessment.  
Many structures simply require nonlinear models [2, 3].  But 
it is also true that as damage progresses nonlinearities become 
important even in otherwise linear structures, with hysteretic 
effects appearing as cracks propagate in a structure.  Although 
various publications on nonlinear system identification have 
appeared in the last decade, important challenges are yet to be 
confronted.  Possible model uncertainties, sampling errors, 
and other sources of measurement errors deter successful 
identification schemes [2].  It would be sophisticated to 
analyze the identification methodology within a probabilistic 
framework due to the random nature of environmental loads. 
A statistical confidence interval based model refinement 
approach has been proposed in this study and applied to the 
developed power series model [4] for the health monitoring of 
structural systems.  The sudden damage of nonlinear structural 
systems under earthquake-induced ground excitations is of 
concern here: identification of the whole structural area without 
intermediate stages of measurement.  Chain-like type 
structural systems (e.g. shear-type buildings as in Fig. 1) 
subjected to seismic induced ground motions have been 
evaluated in the lab.  Time histories of structural accelerations 
and velocities are measured, while corresponding structural 
displacements are integrated from measured velocities. 
EVALUATION OF STIFFNESS USING NONLINEAR 
STRESS ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE 
A simplified benchmark problem of a structural system 
(Fig. 1), a three-story 30% scaled steel structure, subjected to 
one-directional excitations is considered.  Principal signals of 
the two seismic excitations ( 005.0=Δt sec within 1201 data

Repeat this process by rerunning the regression and analyzing 
the confidence interval results of the sifted parameters to refine 
the model until all parameters are statistically sustainable, i.e. 
the 95% confidence interval of all estimated parameters do not 
contain the zero value in the end of the model updating 
approach. 
The benchmark problem of the hysteretic structure (Fig. 1) 
is considered to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model 
updating approach.  In the multiple regression setting, it is 
assumed that no initial information on the magnitude of the 
structural parameters is available and that the type of the model 
is unknown.  Table 1 lists the multiple regression of the power 
series model for the first floor of the structure under the El-
Centro ground excitations.  The component y denotes the 
variation of the restoring force over time while the component 
jx  corresponds to the component of the parameter ja  in Eq. 
(2).  The R-square value [9] refers to the fraction (86.76%) of 
the variation in the values of y that is explained by the multiple 
least-squares regression of y on jx  (j=1, 2, 3, …, 34). 
Keeping the components of the estimated parameters 
whose 95% confidence interval does not contain the zero value 
and rerunning the multiple regression will lead to the results in 
Table 2.  Consequently, this statistical sifting process 
maintains the contributing parameters to the structural restoring 
force in the first round, reducing the identification error.  It is 
feasible to continue such a sifting process for the current 
updated model until its statistical significance cannot be 
improved further.  In this way, the identification error will be 
much reduced.  This is because every time the non-
contributing parameters are removed, the truly contributing 
parameters are granted more statistical significance as shown 
by their shorter range of the 95% confidence interval (e.g. the 
parameter of x2 shown in Tables 1-2), corresponding to the 
shorter range of variation in terms of precision on one hand.  
Along with the simple random sampling design of the 
experiment without bias, the parameters are sifted in such a 
way toward their true values in terms of accuracy on the other 
hand. 
Continuing the sifting process will result in Tables 3, 4, 
and 5, respectively, in an orderly fashion.  It is clear that the 
final updated model in Table 5 contains only three components, 
which model is substantially simplified from its original 
pattern, while still maintaining the high R-square value.  In 
fact, the R-square value in the final updated model does not 
decrease much from its initial setting, only in 1% range, 
sufficing for a good model updating approach [9].  The 
simplified model will be beneficial not only to the 
identification of large space systems where several degrees of 
freedom and related parameters are to be evaluated but also to 
the design of system vibration control.  
In Table 5, the final estimated parameter value 
corresponding to component x2, i.e. the structural stiffness, is 
6106828.1 ×  with the 95% confidence interval range of 
6106428.1 ×  and 6107228.1 × .  Compared to the results 
(1652892.562 N/m) from the above NSAT analysis, this linear 
stiffness parameter is well-identified with its 95% confidence 
interval containing the value of the NSAT results.  This 
comparison shows that the statistical results of the proposed 
model updating approach are not deviated from the right path 
of parameter estimation and in fact can satisfactorily cover the 
sampling or modeling error.  Using the NSAT results as a 
comparison gauge, the relative error of the estimated stiffness 
between these two methods is reduced from the initial power 
series model (3.26%) to the final refined model (1.81%) as 
shown in Table 6.  In fact, the method of the 95% confidence 
interval based model updating approach is unlikely to fail in 
capturing structural properties: it will fail only in the 
probability of 5% (1-95%) in one set of samples [9]. 
For stochastic modeling where no a priori information on 
the type of the structural model is available, the proposed 
model updating approach is also applied to the series models of 
the linear and the Taylor series—the power series in Eq. (2) 
without the cross-product components.  It turns out that the 
statistically updated power series model provides the least 
relative error when compared to the simulated model using the 
NSAT.  Tables 6 and 7 list the identified stiffness of the 3-
story benchmark structure (Fig. 1) subjected to El-Centro and 
TCU084 vibration data, respectively, using both the NSAT and 
the proposed model updating approach in the multiple 
regression setting for the models of the linear, Taylor, and 
power series.  Using the results of the NSAT as a gauge, the 
relative error is given.  The average relative error for each 
excitation case is shown respectively in the last column of 
Tables 6 and 7.  The total average error, as shown in Table 7, 
indicates that the updated power series model has the least 
relative error (4.18%) in stiffness estimation when compared to 
the NSAT results.  Indeed, the 95% confidence interval based 
approach will fail only in the probability of 0.25% (5%*5%), 
resulting from the fact that each test in the cases of El-Centro 
and TCU084 excitations is independent with the failure 
probability of 5%. 
CONCLUSIONS 
An effective 95% confidence interval based model 
updating approach has been proposed in this study for the 
health diagnosis of nonlinear structural systems.  Its 
effectiveness has been shown in evaluating structural stiffness.  
Using the result of the Nonlinear Stress Analysis Technique 
(NSAT) as a gauge, the relative estimation error has been 
reduced from the initially developed power series model to the 
statistically updated model in the multiple regression setting.  
The initial power series model, along with the linear series and 
the Taylor series model, is established in such a way that the 
variation of the restoring force over time can be explained by 
the multivariable polynomial expansion of acceleration, 
velocity, displacement, and the restoring force itself under the 
condition that no a priori information on the type of the 
structure is available.  Inevitable excessive parameters in the 
power series model have been repetitively removed in each

control methods for matched basis functions for application in 
real time.  To do so we need a real time method of finding the 
components of the output on the output basis functions.  We 
investigate the use of the projection algorithm and the wavelet 
filtering.  The wavelet filtering is superimposed on the 
projection algorithm: in each time step the output signal 
computed by the projection algorithm is decomposed and then 
reconstructed via the wavelet filtering.  The effect of the 
wavelet filtering is studied through the comparison of the 
tracking errors of the output signals computed by the projection 
algorithm and by the projection algorithm with wavelet 
filtering.  The addition of the wavelet filtering is used to 
further cancel the non-periodic disturbance for accuracy 
promotion [12].  For on-line applications, the output tracking 
error of the numerical example shown in this study appears 
further reduced at the expenses of slower convergence.  For 
off-line applications, on the other hand, when the machines are 
shutdown for maintenance or software test, the output tracking 
error appears the same result with that computed via the pure 
projection algorithm.  In real-life and on-line applications, the 
superposition of the wavelet filtering on the projection 
algorithm proves quite effective in precision repetitive control. 
THE MATCHED BASIS FUNCTION SYSTEM MODEL 
The repetitive control action aims to find a time function 
which when added to the command to the feedback control 
system eliminates the effects of the periodic disturbance or 
periodic tracking error in responding to a periodic command.  
We agree to limit the adjustments of the command input that to 
ones lying in a space spanned by a chosen set of periodic basis 
functions.  As in [9] we presume that we can perform 
experiments applying these chosen basis functions individually 
to the existing feedback control system.  In these experiments 
we wait until steady state response is reached, record the 
periodic output, and the result is the set of matching output 
basis functions.  When there is a periodic disturbance present, 
we must conduct two experiments with different amplitudes 
multiplying the input basis function, and then take the 
differences of inputs and the differences of outputs, in order to 
eliminate the effect of the disturbance in defining the output 
basis functions.  The mathematics is general for any chosen set 
of basis functions, but an important special case is sinusoidal 
basis functions, as apply to the problem of eliminating 60 Hz 
and harmonics in the electron beam focus problem [13]. 
The Basis Functions and the System Model 
Wen and Longman [13] define uT  as a matrix of p rows, 
each column representing one period of the corresponding 
chosen discrete-time basis function, and its value is 
2 *sin( )f i
p
π  or 2 *cos( )f i
p
π , where 0,1, , 1i p= −L .  The 
yT  is the corresponding matrix of output basis functions, 
giving the output that would be obtained if there were no 
periodic disturbance.  The matrices α  and β  are defined as 
column matrices of the coefficients of the output and the input 
basis functions, respectively.  If the input is the linear 
combination defined by uu T β= , then the steady state 
response is y yy T Tα β= = .  This makes the steady state 
system response model in basis function space into an identity 
matrix I, 
 
Iα β=  (1)
LINEAR REPETITIVE CONTROL LAWS IN TERMS OF 
COMPONENTS ON MATCHED BASIS FUNCTIONS 
A general linear repetitive control law for real time 
implementation is [13] 
 
β (k +1) = β(k) + Γ(α * − ?α (k)) (2)
 
where Γ  is a square matrix of learning gains, ?α (k)  is the 
column vector of current estimates of the output components on 
the output basis functions, and *α  is the desired trajectory 
written in terms of components on the output basis functions, 
which can be written in terms of the p time step history of one 
period of the desired trajectory, *y , according to * *yT yα += , 
where yT
+  is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. 
CHOICES FOR REAL TIME COMPUTATION OF 
COMPONENTS ON BASIS FUNCTIONS 
Here we seek to do real time updates, which recursively 
determine some estimate of the components on the output basis 
functions every time step, ?α (k).  There are various ways to do 
this, including the projection algorithm common in adaptive 
control, and various forms of recursive least squares [14-16].  
In this study, we utilize the projection algorithm, and the ?α (k) 
can be represented as [13] 
 
?α (k) = ?α (k −1) + Φ(k)[y(k) − TyT (k) ?α (k −1)] (3)
 
where ( )kΦ  can be determined a prior, and is not a function of 
data.  The ( )TyT k  is determined from yT  whose columns 
contain one period of the periodic basis functions.  In the 
following, we discuss the form of ( )kΦ  in the projection 
algorithm.  We pay particular attention to, because in this case 
the ( )kΦ  becomes a periodic function of time step, a property 
that facilitates the stability analysis.

cAi denotes the coefficient of the approximations at the i-th 
decomposed level while cDi denotes the coefficient of the 
details at the i-th decomposed level, respectively, and 
1 2 i iS=cD +cD + +cD +cAL .  The wavelet reconstruction (or 
wavelet inverse transform) refers to the combination of the 
decomposed components, using either the approximations or 
details or their mixed version with selected level components, to 
reconstruct the original signal via a filter.  In this study, we 
choose all components of the details ( icD ), having the property 
of low-scale and high-frequency, and remove all components of 
the approximations to reconstruct the output signal in order to 
cancel the non-periodic low-frequency disturbance.

Wavelet Function 
Wavelet filters includes several families, each with its own 
property.  Each family consists of several wavelet functions 
with different numbers of vanishing moments [12].  From the 
literature record, the Haar function [23] was first wavelet 
function proposed by Alfréd Haar in 1909.  Other wavelet 
functions include the Morlet wavelet [24], Meyer wavelet [25], 
Biorthogonal wavelet, Mallat wavelet [26], Daubechies wavelet 
[27], Coiflets wavelet, Symlets wavelet, and Mexican Hat 
wavelet, etc. 
In this study, we utilize the Haar function as the wavelet 
filter.  It is the pioneered wavelet function and the simplest one.  
Haar wavelet is discontinuous, and resembles a step function.  
Based on the on-line test as shown in Fig. 5-3 and 5-4, 
satisfactory results can be obtained using the Haar wavelet with 
the signal decomposition level up to level 5.  In terms of 
wavelet families, the results of the Haar wavelet are similar to 
the Daubechies wavelet but the Haar wavelet has faster 
computation speed.  Thus, the following numerical example 
uses the Haar wavelet with signal decomposition level 5. 
The Haar wavelet’s mother wavelet can be represented as:

EXAMPLES 
To study and illustrate the behavior of the repetitive control 
laws developed here, we consider a third order transfer function 
model that was found to represent rather well the input to output 
behavior of feedback controllers for each axis of a Robotics

where 8.8a =  corresponding to a break frequency of 1.4 Hz, 
and 37ω =  rad/sec, giving the first robot undamped natural 
vibration frequency at 5.9 Hz.  This system is simple, yet it is 
sufficiently complex that it is found to be a good test case for 
studying learning and repetitive control laws.  For the robot the 
damping ratio is 0.5ζ =  which is sufficiently fast that there is 
more than one settling time in a one second period.  In order to 
accentuate the potential difficulties associated with transients 
crossing from one period to the next, we artificially decrease the 
damping to 0.05ζ = .  This makes a time constant of 1.85 
sec, and the setting time is often taken as four time constants or 
7.4 sec.  Thus, transients take nearly seven and a half periods 
to decay, and it is far from being quasi steady state using 
reasonable learning gains.  The sample rate is taken as 64 Hz, 
and the closed loop governing equation for the feedback 
controller is given by the difference equation associated with (9) 
for this sample rate, assuming a zero order hold on the input.  
As is common in repetitive control problems, the desired 
trajectory is zero, and there is a periodic disturbance added to 
the output, i.e. it is a disturbance rejection problem.

analysis.  Fig. 5-3 and 5-4 are the results of the on-line 
projection algorithm and the on-line wavelet analysis.  The 
learning gain Γ  is 0.01 time the identity matrix.  The other 
parameters are 0c = , 1a = , and the initial ?α  and β  are 
set to zero at the time the repetitive control is turned on after 
one period.  These values apply to all of the projection 
algorithm results cited here.  A gain of 0.01 appears to give the 
fastest results.  Using only the off-line projection algorithm, it 
takes about 50 repetitions until zero error is reached (a 
numerical zero).  It appears no difference when introducing the 
off-line wavelet analysis through the comparison of Fig. 5-1 and 
5-2.  However, when introducing the wavelet analysis to the 
projection algorithm in on-line operation, the RMS tracking 
error and the output coefficients error both are more reduced at 
the expenses of slower convergence (about 80 repetitions until 
zero error is reached) as shown in Fig. 5-3 and 5-4.  Fig. 5-2 
and 5-4 give the difference between the current estimate of 
components on the output basis functions, and the desired 
output basis function components.  The plot takes the absolute 
value, and then the logarithm, and changing signs of the errors 
can produce some of the irregularity seen in these curves. 
The off-line repetitive control is used purely for software 
test and in practical machine operation it must be on-line.  
Thus the following example gives the on-line real time 
operation and compares the results of the projection algorithm 
with and without the wavelet analysis.
