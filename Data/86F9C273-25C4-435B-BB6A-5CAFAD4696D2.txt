ABSTRACT
A three-dimensional lattice model is constructed to theoretically study the size
effects on the elastic properties of nanofilms with the face-center-cubic crystal
structure. Unlike the classical continuum theory, this lattice model directly takes the
discrete nature in the thickness direction into account. Only the interactions between
the nearest and second nearest atoms are considered in this model and represented as
harmonic springs. The constitutive relation of the nanofilm is then derived by using
the energy approach and the analytical expressions of the elastic moduli of nanofilms,
including in-plane, out-plane Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, are obtained. 
Further, these expressions along different crystal orientations of nanofilms are also
formulated. It is shown that the nanofilm in in-plane surface may be stiffer or softer

[19] constructed a simple model taking account of surface tension to predict the
size-dependent elastic properties of nanofilms and reached the similar conclusion.
However, Villain et al. [20] discussed the effect of surface tension on the
size-dependent elastic constants of tungsten layers and found that the reverse is true.
Meanwhile, Zhou and Huang [17] observed the electron redistribution near the
surface and suggested the atomic coordination would compete with electron
redistribution effect to influence this size dependence along different crystal
orientation. In view of the foregoing, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the
observed size and orientation dependence are still lack of conclusive explanation.
Although for nanofilm, the continuum approach can be applied to the in-plane
dimensions in order to achieve simplicity, the dimension in the thickness direction is
in the order of the atomic scale, which does not allow the use of the averaging process
to derive the effective continuum properties. Based on this idea, Sun and Zhang [21]
proposed a semicontinuum model for nanofilms with a simple cubic structure such as
sodiumchloride (NaCl) type materials and found that the Young’s modulus decreases 
as the film thickness decreases. However, not so many materials possess the simple
cubic structure, and thus, in this paper, a three-dimensional lattice model will be
constructed to investigate the size dependence of the elastic moduli for the
face-center-cubic (fcc) crystal structure nanofilms. Meanwhile, the effect of nanofilm
crystal orientation on this size dependence will also be studied in detail.
2. Three Dimensional Lattice Model of Nanofilm
In three dimensional lattice model of fcc nanofilm, the dimensions of the
in-plane direction are assumed to be much larger compared to the out-plane
dimension. Figure 1 shows the geometry of a nanofilm with uniform thickness h, with
plane axes x and y in the middle surface and z axis perpendicular to the middle surface.
The fcc nanofilm is orientated along x 100 , y 010 and z 001 crystal direction,
which will be referred to as  100/001 nanofilm hereafter. The discrete circles
represent atoms and the lattice constant is a. The atoms on k and k+ 1/2 layers are
denoted as the same atomic layer, i.e. kth atomic layer, where 1/2 is used to represent
the atoms which are sitting at the middle of the cubic face. Along the thickness
direction, there are 2N+1 (N=1, 2,….) atomic layers. The odd number of atomic 
layers is chosen only for mathematical simplicity in the derivation of this model, the
current model is also applicable to the nanofilm of even number of atomic layers. The
in-plane dimensions are assumed to be much larger compared to the lattice constant

respect to their bulk values. It is seen clearly from the figure that the elastic moduli
(i.e. in-plane, out-plnae Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratios) approach their bulk 
values as the film thickness increase. Also, all the in-plane and out-plane Young’s 
moduli show softening behavior (see figure 3(a)), which means their values decrease
with the decrease of film thickness. Moreover, the out-plane Poisson’s ratios (xz , yz )
increase but the in-plane Poisson’s ratio, xy , decreases with increasing film
thickness. Note that the anisotropic behavior of in-plane Poisson’s ratio,xy , and
out-plane Poisson’s ratios (xz , yz ) is observed even though the three axes, x 100 ,
y  010 and z  001 should be crystallographic equivalent. As expected, this
size-induced anisotropy wil become less significant since al the Poisson’s ratios 
approach the same bulk value as the total number of atomic layers increase.
4. Crystal Orientation Effect
In order to investigate the crystal orientation effect on the elastic moduli, the
lattice model of fcc nanofilms could be reconstructed along different crystal directions
in a similar method. Two other different crystal orientations of nanofilms are
considered. One crystal orientation is chosen as x 110 , y 101 and z 001 (see figure
4) and it will be referred to as  110/001 nanofilm. The other is x 101 , y 211 and
z 111 (see figure 5) and will be denoted as   101/111 nanofilm. The formulation
is similar to the one for the  100/001 nanofilm, so the detailed derivation process
would be omitted for brevity.
For the  110/001 nanofilm, the elastic moduli are derived as

The calculated elastic moduli for   101/111 nanofilm as a function of film
thickness are shown in figure 7(a). It is obvious that the in-plane Young’s modulus, 
xE , shows stifening behavior while the other two Young’s moduli show softening 
behavior. The variation in Poisson’s ratios with film thickness is shown in figure 7(b).
It is clearly that the Out-plane Poisson’s ratios (xz , yz ) decrease but the in-plane
Poisson’s ratio, xy , increases as the film thickness increases. This behavior is
opposite to that observed in two previous cases.
5. Discussion and Conclusion
As seen in figure 3, 6 and 7, the trend for in-plane Young’s modulus ( xE or yE ) is
dependent on the crystal orientation of nanofilms. This implies that whether the
nanofilm in in-plane surface is stiffer or softer depends on its crystal orientation.
Similar results have also been reported in MD simulations of EAM copper [15, 17]
and gold [18] thin films. However, the out-plane Young’s modulus, zE , is always
softer for all three orientations, which means that the nanofilm surface is always softer
than the bulk. So far, there have been no reports on this soften phenomenon. Direct
MD simulation using EAM potential to further verify this result is underway.
The surface effects such as surface stress, energy, tension or atomic coordination
has been suggested in the literatures [16,17,19] as the mechanism for the
size-dependent elastic moduli. However, the present model results are obtained by
only using the total strain energy density of a nanofilm without any surface effect and
show the similar trend. This indicates that these surface effects are implicitly involved
in the total strain energy density and the fundamental mechanisms of
stiffening/softening behavior for nanomaterials are not yet fully understood. Further
