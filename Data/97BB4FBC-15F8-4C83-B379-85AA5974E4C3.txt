1. 前言 
本計劃第一年除了積極搜尋各種人工肌肉的資訊之外，重點在於研究人工肌
肉纏繞拓樸(Routing topology)構造的合成及圖集，以及不同纏繞構造之機器臂效
率的分析。人工肌肉是一種腱驅動系統，本研究使用腱驅動系統的構造表示法，
並運用 Lee 與 Tsai 在研究中所提出的 Degree of Incidence(DOI)的概念，更改其限
制式，得到在 n 自由度 m 條腱的系統下可以使用的結構矩陣形式。並定義系統
中經過相同關節的滑輪半徑相等，同時利用等方向性的概念，探討結構矩陣必須
滿足的條件，並合成出適合這樣條件的結構矩陣形式及值的分布。第一年的成果
已投稿期刋（Robotica），並已被接受，如附件。 
本計劃第二年係針對第一年之理論研究，進行實驗驗證。首先須考慮選用適
當的人工肌肉材料。目前已知的人工肌肉主要有兩大主流：第一種是使用金屬材
料製成的，如形狀記憶合金(Shape memory alloy，簡稱 SMA)，另一種是以高分
子材料做成的，如電致動高分子(Electroactive polymer, 簡稱 EAP)。第一種的發
展比較早，它是利用温度變化來使材料變形。SMA 的應用範圍較廣，甚至可以
做成科學性玩具。第二種（EAP）是一種透過電壓來致動的高分子材料，當施以
電壓時，它會伸長（或彎曲）變形。經由這種電能與機械能的轉換，可以產生許
多的應用。EAP 又可分為電子型以及離子型 EAP 兩大類，電子型需要甚大的電
壓來驅動 (20~150 Mega Volt/m)，故不適合本實驗室使用；離子型電致動聚合物
則用在彎曲(Bending)動作上，有較好的效果。其致動所需電壓雖然較低，但要在
濕的環境之下使用。由於 SMA 的取得較為容易，也不會有高電壓的問題，所以
本計劃選擇使用 SMA 做為人工肌肉的材料。 
另外，與實驗相關的手臂骨骼力學特性的收集，其結果如附件二。由於本次
實驗主要在控制手臂的位置，尚未討論到其力量分析，所以這一部份資料在底下
的報告中並未用到。

出以 Lagrangian 法推導多自由度腱驅動機構之動力方程式；Lee 與 Lee[13]提出
利用 Newton-Euler 方程式與腱拉力方程式，可以有系統地推導出多由由度機構
之動力方程式並進行動力分析。 
在控制方面，Morecki[14]、Salisbury 與 Craig[15]提出 n 個自由度具有 n+1
個致動器之腱驅動機構的力量控制法；Yen[16]提出以人造位能場的概念，依據
Lyapunov 穩定性理論設計一控制器避免腱驅動機構發腱鬆弛的現象；Kaneko[17]
提出腱驅動機構的機械手之關節力矩控制。以 SMA 做為腱之腱驅動機構方面，
Ashrafiuon、Eshraghi、Elahinia[1]提出以 SMA 驅動 3 連杆機構之位置控制；Han、
Park、Choi[2]以 2 條 SMA 配合 2 條彈簧控制單桿之端點在球面上的移動軌跡； 
Nakazato、Kato 及 Masuda[18,19]提出 1 個自由度以單邊 SMA 驅動和雙邊 SMA
拮抗性腱驅動機構之模糊控制；另外還有許多改良式的模糊控制方法應用於以
SMA 為腱的腱驅動機構。Ahn、Nquyen[20]以自適應(self-tuning)模糊控制來做到
1 條 SMA 的位置控制。Baranyi、Korondi、Hashimoto[21]等人以奇異值分解法減
少規則的數量，並以 4 條 SMA 控制單桿之端點追尋圓軌跡。Lei、Yam、Baranyi[22]
將 4 條 SMA 一端相連另一端固定，做成十字型並用類神經模糊 PID 控制，使十
字的中心做到圓軌跡的追尋。 
目前以 SMA 為腱的腱驅動機構多為 1 個自由度，另外多自由度的腱驅動機
構也以多條腱來達成控制的目的。Morecki[7]所提出的 n 自由度可由 n+1 條腱來
控制之理論，會產生誤差回授的問題。因為當腱產生位移時，會對每個繞過的滑
輪造成影響，在回授時就必須考慮到每個角度誤差對腱位移的影響，此時就要考
慮到各個誤差之間的關係，再者各個誤差之間的關係亦會隨腱的繞法或繞過的滑
輪個數的不同而有所差異。 
2.2 腱驅動機構 
人類關節在運動時，類似一個腱驅動機構，在控制腱驅動機構之腱拉力時
主要有二個問題：一為腱可能產生鬆弛的現象、二為腱拉力過大時，導致腱斷裂

間的距離也回復為受力前之情形，故形狀記憶合金可回復至受力前之形狀。變形
過程如圖 2.1 所示(截自 http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514252217/html/x317.html)。

transmission. These effects inevitably increase the complexity in designing the tendon-driven 
robotic system. In order to realize the characteristics of tendon-driven manipulators, a lot of 
research has been performed from many aspects. To name a few, the kinematics and statics of 
articulated tendon-driven robotics mechanisms were investigated by Morecki 1, Salisbury 2, 
and Tsai and Lee 3. Controls of the tendon-driven manipulators were researched by Jacobsen 
et al. 4, Hollars and Cannon 5, and Oh et al. 6. Dynamic analysis of tendon-driven 
manipulators was studied by Lee and Lee 7, Prisco and Bergamasco 8, Voglewede and 
Ebert-Uphoff 9, Barrette and Gosselin 10, and Diao and Ma 11. Even recently, some new 
technology in materials as electroactive polymers (EAP) has been proposed to emulate natural 
muscles and applied in the tendon-driven manipulators 12. This emerging technology can be 
potentially used to make the robot without the need for traditional mechanical component as 
bearings, pulleys, and rotary motors. The above results provide much profound insight into 
the design of tendon-driven manipulators. 
In order to enhance the design of tendon-driven manipulators, Lee and Tsai 13 proposed a 
methodology for enumerating the topology of tendon routings. Certain admissible tendon 
routings were obtained. Their approach was based on the assumption that all the actuators 
were installed on the base link and the outcome was limited to the generation of the kinematic 
structures with pseudo-triangular form. On the other hand, many researchers use force 
ellipsoids as a tool to measure the manipulability of robotic manipulators 14,15. Lee and Tsai 16 
 5
Principle of Operation  
It has been shown by Tsai and Lee 3, that the kinematic structure of a general 
tendon-driven manipulator can be represented by a planar schematic from which the relations 
between the tendon displacements and joint angles can be derived systematically. Figure 1 
shows the planar schematic of a general tendon-driven manipulator having n-DOF and m (m ≥ 
n+1) open-end control tendons. For convenience, assume that the joints are numbered 
sequentially from the proximal (base) end to the distal end. The transformation from joint 
angles, θ, to tendon linear displacements, S, can be written as 
 S = A θ  (1) 
where S = [s1, s2, …, sm]T is the (m×1) tendon displacement vector, θ = [θ1, θ2, …, θn] T is the 
(n×1) joint angle vector, and A=[aij] is the (m×n) displacement structure matrix. Similarly, the 
transformation from tendon forces to joint torques can be written as 
 τ = B ξ  (2) 
where τ= [τ1, τ2, …, τn]T is the (n×1) joint torque vector, ξ= [ξ1, ξ2, …, ξm] T is the (m×1) tendon 
force vector, and B = AT is the (n×m) force structure matrix. The element bij of B also 
indicates the condition of adjacency of the tendon j with joint i. The value of bij is nonzero if 
tendon j passes through joint i, otherwise it is zero. As mentioned by earlier researchers 
(Morecki 1, Salisbury 2), the control of an n-DOF manipulator requires at least (n+1) tendons. 
Tsai 19 further extended the characteristics of the structure matrix B to a general n-DOF 
 7
 ξ= (B)+ τ + H λ (3) 
where (B)+ = (BT )[B BT]-1 is the pseudo-inverse of B, H is an m×(m-n)-dimensional matrix 
whose column vectors span the null space of matrix B, and λ is an (m-n)×1 vector whose 
elements are arbitrary constants. The first item on the right hand side of Eq. (3) is known as 
the particular solution while the second term is the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous 
solution is used to adjust the tension in tendons and hence must allow all tendons to remain 
position tension. 
The structure matrix B is of primary importance in determining the characteristics of a 
tendon-driven manipulator. Before synthesizing the dimension of the structure matrix B, it is 
necessary to enumerate the feasible structures of a general system, i.e., an n-DOF system with 
m (m≥n+1) tendons. Without loss of generality, we assume that each tendon can route 
between any two links. 
Let mi be the number of tendons in a group in which every tendon is incident with i joints. 
Thus, the total number of tendons in all possible groups will be equal to m. We have 
 ∑
=
n
i 1
mi = m   (4) 
The maximal times that all tendons are incident with the joints occur at the condition when all 
tendons are attached to the distal link and route down to the base link. This number constitutes 
the upper limit of the possible incidence of tendons and joints. Therefore, the following 
inequality holds 
 9
(0, 2, 3), (1, 1, 3), (2, 0, 3), (0, 3, 2), (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2), (3, 0, 2), (0, 4, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 2, 1), (3, 
1, 1), (4, 0, 1), (0, 5, 0), (1, 4, 0), (2, 3, 0), (3, 2, 0), and (4, 1, 0). There are a total of 117 
feasible structures corresponding to the above possible solutions. Detail results can be 
referred to Huang 20. Table 2 shows two solution sets and the corresponding feasible 
structures in which some will be used for dimensional synthesis of the structure matrix in the 
later section. 
Isotropic Transmission   
A tendon-driven manipulator that possesses isotropic transmission characteristics may 
have more even force distribution during the operation. Ou and Tsai 17 defined the following 
two conditions for a manipulator to have isotropic transmission characteristics: 
 cond (B+JT) = 1   (7) 
 B ξh = 0   (8) 
where cond(·) denotes the condition number of (·) and the value is the ratio of maximum 
singular value to minimum singular value of (·), B+ is the pseudo-inverse of B, J is the 
Jacobian matrix of the manipulator, and ξh = [1, 1, …, 1]T is an (m×1) isotropic vector. 
Mathematically, the product of (B+JT) and the force applied on the end-effector serve as the 
particular solution for the tendon tension while its condition number measures the shape of 
the ellipsoid formed by the row vector space of (B+JT). The isotropic vector ξh is the 
homogeneous solution to tendon forces that results in no net joint torques and can provide a

is an (n×n) diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the singular values. Substituting Eqs. 
(11a) and (12a) into Eq.(7), yields 
 cond(V D+ UT Q ΣT PT) = 1   (13) 
If U is chosen to be equal to Q and noting that Q is unitary, Eq. (13) implies that the diagonal 
elements in the product (D+ΣT) must be equal to a constant value. That is 
 di = σi /c2    for  i=1, 2, … , n (14) 
where c2 is a non-zero scaling constant. Therefore, from Eqs. (10a), (12a), and (14), we can 
find matrices U and D of Eq. (10a) once the Jacobian matrix J of the manipulator is identified. 
Now, to obtain the structure matrix B, it is still necessary to find the matrix V. Since V is 
unitary, the elements vij’s in V satisfy the orthogonality conditions 
 13
determining the types of structure matrix and the dimension of the structure can be 
summarized as follows: 
1. Determine the Jacobian matrix J of the manipulator. Then, find the SVD of J as J = P Σ 
QT. 
2. Let U = Q and D = Σ. Substituting the results into Eq. (10a), yields

3. Select a feasible type of structure matrix from Table 1 or Table 2 or known atlas. Then, 
compare Eq. (18a) with the selected type of structure. The zero elements in the selected 
matrix can be regarded as the additional topology constraints besides Eqs. (15a), (15b) and 
(17). If there are still free choices left, then the elements can be specified according to other 
applicable geometric constraints.

structure matrix for the system at a given posture as a1 = 2 , a2 = 1.6 , a3 = 1.2, θ1 = 30°, θ2 = 
80°, and θ3 = 20°. The Jacobian matrix of this system is 
J =

tendon forces of the synthesized systems throughout the workspace. The static force 
relationship between external forces acting on the end-effector and tendon forces can be 
obtained by substituting τ = JT f into Eq.(3) as 
 ξ= B+ JT f + λ H (26) 
where f is an (n×1) general force vector acting on the end-effector as shown in Fig. 5.  
If the force vector, f, is confined to be bounded on a unit circle (Newton), Eq. (26) can be 
used to find the corresponding tendon forces. For the purpose of comparison, the value λ in 
Eq. (26) is adjusted such that one of the tendons has zero tendon force while the other tendons    
have nonnegative tensions. Also, to achieve a fair comparison among various structures, the 
scaling constant c2 in matrix B is chosen to be equal to the square root of the multiplication of 
the singular values of B. This assumption also makes the area of the ellipse formed by the 
particular solution to be equal to the area formed by the force vector. 
Table 3 lists four different structures and their corresponding properties. No.(a) is a 
2-DOF system having 3 tendons and isotropic transmission characteristics. The link length 
and joint angles are the same as those of Example 1. No.(b) is the structure matrix designed 
by OU and Tsai17 whose link parameters are a1 =L (m), a2 = 0.707L (m), and the isotropic 
position is at joint angles θ1 = 45°, θ2 = 225°. In this work, we let L = 0.6 to make the first link 
to have the same length as that of the other three structures. No.(c) is the structure of Example 
1. No.(d) is chosen from the first structure matrix of type (1, 3) in Table 1 and has the same

Conclusion 
Different tendon routings affect the force transmission in tendon-driven manipulators. In 
this work, the feasible tendon routing topology of a general n-DOF tendon-driven manipulator 
with m tendons is enumerated. The types of structure matrices can be further used as the atlas 
for the dimensional synthesis of tendon-driven manipulators. Design equations for the 
synthesis of tendon-driven manipulators with isotropic transmission characteristics are then 
developed via singular value decomposition method. The singular value decomposition 
method offers the designer a fast yet systematic means in determining the dimensions of 
tendon pulleys. Two examples of general structure matrices are used to demonstrate the 
methodology. It can be seen that this method provides designer with wider settings in 
determining the kinematic structures of tendon-driven manipulators with isotropic 
transmission characteristics. Although the isotropic transmission characteristics of a 
tendon-driven manipulator is position dependent, a better design of tendon-driven 
manipulators still can be achieved through careful selection of the tendon routing as well as 
the isotropic position.

Tendons

Abstract. In this work, application of a fuzzy logic controller to a tendon driven manipulator with 
flexible tendons is investigated. This fuzzy controller uses only the positional signals drawn from the joint 
angle and motor angles as the inputs. The positional signals are divided into three inputs as the joint angle 
error, rate of change of joint angle error, and difference between the joint angle and motor angle. The last 
term can be converted to the tendon tension by multiplying the spring constant of tendons. This 
conversion avoids the noise getting into the system when acquiring signals from the force sensors. The 
fuzzy controller is first investigated through the simulation of a one degree-of-freedom tendon-driven 
manipulator. The experiment are then conducted and compared to the traditional PI controller. The result 
shows that the fuzzy controller can be better than the PI controller over the step input response.  
1  Introduction 
In the past decades, robot manipulators that utilize tendons (ropes, cables, belts, and 
chains) for motion/force transmission have attracted much attention of researchers from many 
areas such as the design of mechanical hands (Jakobsen, 1985; Salisbury, 1982), 
cable-suspended platform (Albus et al.,1992; Kawamura et al.,1995) and robots for biological 
use (Hirose, 1993). These traditional tendons allow actuators to be installed on the remote base; 
therefore a less bulky system can be designed. It is known that using tendon transmission has 
the advantages of low inertia, backlash free motion, and smaller system volume; yet with the 
adverse of friction in joints, antagonism in tendon motion and complexity in controls. Among 
the unfavorable effects, tendons with spring effect are one of the problems that make the 
system highly nonlinear and difficult to control. Hollars and Cannon (1985) experimented on 
the tendon-driven manipulators with flexible tendons where the endless type 
pulley-and-flexible belts in the system were used. It was shown the compliance in tendons was 
difficult to control. Jacobsen et al. (1990) proposed certain control algorithms with force 
feedback to prevent antagonism problem in tendons. Kawanishi et al. (2000) reported a 
research work on the fuzzy control of position and elasticity for robot fingers. Yen et al. (2007) 
presented a control method for flexible tendons using artificial potential field approach. 
Basically, these work all were based upon the study or experiment on the traditional tendons, 
i.e., the compliance of tendons are small or limited. Nonetheless, they still provided valuable 
insight into the nature of the tendon-driven manipulators. In recent, with the advent of new 
material, some artificial tendons can be made as ‘soft’ as biological muscles. One of the 
examples is the electroactive polymer (EAP) (Bar-Cohen, 2006). This type of artificial muscle 
can have strain up to 40% as the biological muscles; thus make it able to mimic the properties 
of the biological muscles. It is a difficult task to control the position of tendon-driven 
output joint angle error (error), rate of change of output joint angle error (error_c), and joint 
angle difference between the output joint angle and motor angle. The last term when multiplied 
by the spring constant of the tendon is equivalent to the tendon tension. The reason we use this 
calculated value to replace the tension measured from the stain gauge is that for a flexible 
tendon, the force derived from the stretch will be more accurate than that from the stain gauge 
sensor. The signal from stain gauge sensors always accompanies noise and needs extra effort to 
fill noise out. Each input membership is partitioned into five regions as shown in Fig. 2. These 
regions are positive big (PB), positive small (PS), zero (ZO), negative small (NS), and negative 
big (NB). The output of the controller controls the motor angle and is also partitioned into five 
regions. The fuzzy joint control rules are reasoned as follows: 
1. If the tension is positive small, or negative small, or zero, then the motion control is 
determined by the position control algorithm which is tabulated as shown in Fig 3. 
This also implies the position of the output joint is of major concern at this phase. 
2. If the tension is positive big (PB), then the motor that connects to it must move big in a 
direction to ease tension. On the other hand, if the tension is negative big (NB), then 
the motor must move big in a direction to increase the tension. For example, if the 
tension in Tendon 1 is PB, then Motor 1 must move PB (counterclockwise) and vice 
versa.  
3. When the tension is small (NS, or ZO, or PS), and both the joint angle error and rate of 
change of joint angle error are zero, the fuzzy set is further tuned by a micro fuzzy set 
as shown in Fig. 4. This micro fuzzy set contains five smaller regions, NS2, NS1, ZO, 
PS1, and PS2. This rule will be in effect to reduce oscillation quickly when the joint 
angle approaches its steady state. 
The control structure of the system is shown in Fig. 5.  
4 Simulation 
Simulations using proportional, proportional plus integral, and fuzzy logic controllers were 
tested in such model. These simulations were performed to acquire information that is expected 
from the system. The parameters used for the simulation are as follow: moment of inertia of 
link 3= 0.0009 kgm2, pretension in tendons= 5 N, spring constant of tendons= 300 N/m. Detail 
simulation and experiment setup can be referred to Su (2007). A typical result of fuzzy 
controller is shown in Fig. 6 where the joint angle was commanded to move a step input. The 
results show the responses with respect to various positional gains. It is seen that increase in 
the proportional gains may increase the undesirable overshoot. Figure 7 shows the comparison 
of the response of fuzzy controller to the PI controller. Both results are presented with their 
well-tuned gains. Though the fuzzy controller has a larger overshoot than the PI controller, it is 
faster to reach the steady state of the system. This is due to the fact that the mini-fuzzy set in 
the fuzzy controller is in effect when the response approaches the steady state. 
5 Experiment and Discussion 
We first experiment on the response of the system when the input was a step input.  
Figure 8 shows the step input response of the joint angle using the fuzzy controller. The
