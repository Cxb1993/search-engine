英文摘要 
Serotonin transporters (SERT) are essential in modulating the serotonergic neuronal function. 
In previously study, we had developed the two-step registration method to solve registration 
problems of ADAM SPECT to MRI. In the last year, we created 10min I-123 ADAM and MRI 
standard brain templates to overcome the drawback of two-step registration method. 
In this project, we proposed to construct 6-hour ADAM SPECT standard template. We 
expected the template could be used for the reference brain image for I-123 ADAM SPECT image 
analysis. A total of 20 healthy volunteers (male 8 female12, mean age 65 years) entered the study. 
The first step for standard brain strategy was the full registration between each subject. To decide 
the best template brain of all subjects, we used the HAMMER algorithm to register and measure the 
relationship between each subject to template target. Then, we obtained the best template which 
provides the minimum variation. The deformation result of each subject to the template was 
calculated. Finally, we averaged the deformation result to build an average brain. The average brain 
contained the details of each subject and obtained by averaging each deformed MRI brain image. 
For comparing accuracy of different registration methods, the mean counts of midbrain 
activity and the midbrain/cerebellum ratio (M/C Ratio of 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECTstd) were 
analyzed and compared with traditional ICBM, and our previous standard MRI and 10-min I-123 
ADAM SPECT methods. 
The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed 6-hour ADAM SPECT standard brain 
method was better then the ICBM. The mean counts of midbrain activity of 6-hour I-123 ADAM 
SPECTstd method was significantly higher than in ICBM method (150.2±3.18 vs 147.5± 3.66, 
p=0.024). M/C Ratios were also higher in 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECT method than in ICBM 
method (3.76±0.19 vs 3.55±0.21, p=0.003). It indicated that we can directly register the individual 
6-hour ADAM image to the 6-hour standard ADAM SPECT with acceptable accuracy. However, 
the accuracy of the proposed 6-hour standard I-123 ADAM was not approaching the previously 
developed 10-min ADAM standard SPECT method. The mean counts of midbrain activity were 
lower in 6-hour ADAM SPECTstd than in 10-min ADAM SPECTstd methods by using the two-step 
registration (150.2± 3.18 vs 153.05±4.50, p=.002). M/C Ratios also lower in 6-hour I-123 ADAM 
SPECT method than in 10-min ADAM SPECTstd method by using the two-step registration 
(3.76±0.19 vs 4.125±0.154, p=0.00). In conclusion, we preferred using the previously developed 
10-min ADAM SPECT and MRI standard brain method for ADAM SPECT studies. The 6-hour 
ADAM SPECTstd may be used to analyze some specific cases.

We also reconstructed the early I-123-ADAM and MRI standard brain image from our brain 
database. Thus, we can directly register the 6-hour I-123-ADAM image and MRI without the 
personal early I-123-ADAM image and MRI (Fig.2).

In this study, we constructed a 6 hour I-123-ADAM image brain template. The clinical 
correlation of SERT quantization and group different between the proposed template and previous 
study were evaluated.

Materials 
A total of 20 healthy volunteers (male 8, female 12, mean age 65 years) entered the study. All 
subjects gave written informed consent, and ethics committee approval was obtained. We used a 
triple-headed gamma camera with fan-beam collimators after intravenous injection of 185 M Bq of 
I-123 ADAM. Seven sequential scans were acquired: 10 minutes, and 6 hours after injection. 
Standard Brain Construction  
In this project, we construct the standard brain by using the HAMMER elastic registration 
(Dinggang S 2002) (Figure.3).

The relationship of individual 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECT to individual 10-min and individual 
MRI had been confirmed before the 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECT constructed. Thus, after the 
elastic registration, the relationship of 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECTstd to MRI was also confirmed. 
Based on the 6-hour I-123-ADAM template brain, we can register the 6-hour I-123-ADAM 
patient to 6-hour I-123-ADAM template and MRI template without referring to the individual 
I-123-ADAM and individual MR images (Fig.5).

I-123-ADAM and MR imaging.  
 
The proposed 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECTstd was compared with the ICBM, MRIstd and 
10-min I-123 ADAM SPECTstd. The 6-hours I-123 ADAM SPECT was registered to the MRI 
directly. In ICBM, MRIstd and 10-min I-123 ADAM SPECTstd, bath direct and two-step registration 
methods were used. The direct registration uses the 6-hours I-123 ADAM SPECT and MRI. The 
two-step registration strategy uses the initial registration between 10-minutes I-123 ADAM SPECT 
8 
group different between the proposed template and individual can be evaluated. The result showed 
that the accuracy of the proposed 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECTstd was better then the ICBM. It 
indicates the ICBM method can be replaced by the 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECTstd. In addition, the 
6-hour I-123 ADAMstd can solve the image registration problems for an individual long time 
sequence of ADAM images to individual MRI. 
However, the mean counts of midbrain activity were lower in 6-hour ADAM SPECTstd than in 
10-min ADAM SPECTstd methods by using the two-step registration (150.2± 3.18 vs 153.05±4.50, 
p=.002) (Table.1). M/C Ratios also lower in 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECT method than in 10-min 
ADAM SPECTstd method by using the two-step registration (3.76±0.19 vs 4.125±0.154, p=0.00) 
(Table.2). The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed 6-hour ADAM SPECTstd was no 
better than the 10-min ADAMstd method. The major reason is that the 6-hour I-123 ADAM 
variances between each subject were very large. Due to the variance and low resolution, the quality 
of the constructed template was worse than the 10-min ADAM SPECTstd and MRIstd.  
In conclusion, we have presented the 6-hour I-123 ADAM SPECT brain template to solve the 
image registration problems of ADAM SPECT to individual MRI or to standard MRI. It provides a 
simple and reliable solution to the long-time I-123 ADAM SPECT image analysis. However, we 
preferred using the 10-min ADAM SPECTstd and MRIstd for ADAM SPECT studies. The 6-hour 
ADAM SPECT standard brain method can be used to analyze some specific case.
