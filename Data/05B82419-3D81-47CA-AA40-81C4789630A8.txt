題，才能方便生物學家解讀。 
Cancer is a genetic disease, mostly 
resulting from acquired mutations and epigenetic 
changes that influence gene expression. 
Accordingly, a major focus in cancer research is 
identifying genetic markers that can be used for 
precise diagnosis or treatment. Over the last half-
century, investigators have used reductionism to 
discover such markers through the study of 
simple genetic changes like balanced 
chromosomal translocations. For example, 
fundamental insights into the nature of the bcr-
abl gene translocation product resulted in the 
precise molecular classification of chronic 
myelogenous leukemia and recently led to the 
development of the molecularly targeted tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor STI571 for the treatment of this 
disease. Ninety percent of human cancers, 
however, are epithelial in origin and display 
marked aneuploidy, multiple gene amplifications 
and deletions, and genetic instability, making 
resulting downstream effects difficult to study 
with traditional methods. Because this 
complexity probably explains the clinical 
diversity of histological similar tumors, a 
comprehensive understanding of the genetic 
alterations present in all tumors is required. 
Advances in molecular classification of tumors 
may play a central role in cancer treatment. Here, 
a novel approach to genome expression pattern 
interpretation is proposed. Using cDNA 
microarrays data generated by a previous study, 
an intelligent system is able to identify normal 
and diffuse large ovarian cancer patients. 
The systematic classification of types of 
tumours is crucial to achieve advances in cancer 
treatment and research. The specification of 
therapies according to tumour types 
differentiated by pathogenetic patterns may 
maximize the efficacy of the treatment and 
minimize toxicity on the patients [A7, A10]. 
Several limitations about the conventional 
classification techniques based on morphological 
features of the tumour have been reported in the 
literature [1]. Moreover, by analyzing complex 
patterns defined by molecular markers, it has 
been demonstrated that there are subtypes of 
acute leukaemia, prostate cancer, and non-
Hodgkin’s lymphomas [2-3]. Thus, there are two 
useful tasks in cancer classification: prediction 
of classes and discovery of classes. The 
prediction task consists of the assignment of 
particular tumour samples to known types of 
cancer, and the discovery task refers to the 
identification of unrecognized subtypes. In order 
to achieve a better insight into the problem of 
cancer classification, systematic approaches 
based on global gene expression analysis have 
been proposed [1, 3]. 
The most important points in building a 
classifier are these: 
。Collect as many examples as possible and 
divide them into a training set and a test set 
。Use as simple a classification method as 
possible with as few adjustable parameters 
as possible. Advance approaches (neural 
networks and support vector machines) 
require more examples for training than 
nearest-neighbor methods. 
。Test the performance of your classifier on 
the independent test set.

B. Multiclass classification and Prediction

The SVR approach is used to 
approximate an ovarian cancer microarray data ( ){ ,...,pkyx kk 1 ,, = }r . Assuming that a set of basis 
functions ( ){ sxgs  , },..,l1=r  is provided, a family 
of functions exists that can be expressed as a 
linear expansion of the basis functions. Restated, 
the problem of function approximation is 
transformed into that of finding the parameters 
of the following basis function linear expansion:

where ( lθθθ ,...,1∈ )r  is parameter vector to be

五、結論 
 In this project, we proposed some 
intelligent system approaches such that MCSCM, 
RSVR to do classification problem for the 
ovarian cancer microarray data. For the 
dimension reduction and gene selection of 
ovarian cancer microarray data, we propose the 
RSVR and MCSVM, respectively. Hence, a new 
intelligent system is developed for the 
classification of the ovarian cancer microarray 
data in the first year. This new approach can 
provide variable gene selection for the up-
regulated and down-regulated genes on the 
microarray data. That is, the target genes based 
on the up-regulated and down-regulated genes 
are easy to obtain with the SVR. And, the 
proposed method can also overcome the 
multiclass problem under this new structure. 
Besides, the web service is proposed to find gene 
from NCBI.

Abstract—Bioinformatics is the computing response to the 
molecular revolution in biology. This revolution has reshaped 
the lift sciences and given us a deep understanding of DNA 
sequences, RNA synthesis and the generation of proteins. This 
process can be represented as gene expression of molecular 
autoregulatory feedback loop systems. In this paper, the 
annealing robust fuzzy basis function (ARFBF) is proposed to 
improve the problems of fuzzy basis function for modeling of 
gene expression of molecular autoregulatory feedback loop 
systems with outliers. Firstly, the support vector regression 
(SVR) approach is proposed to determine the initial structure of 
ARFBF. Because of a SVR approach is equivalent to solving a 
linear constrained quadratic programming problem under a 
fixed structure of SVR, the number of hidden nodes, the initial 
parameters and the initial weights of ARFBF are easy obtained 
via the SVR approach. Secondly, the results of SVR are used as 
initial structure in ARFBF. At the same time, an annealing 
robust learning algorithm (ARLA) is used as the learning 
algorithm for ARFBF, and applied to adjust the parameters as 
well as weights of ARFBF. That is, an ARLA is proposed to 
overcome the problems of initialization and the cut-off points in 
the robust learning algorithm. Hence, when an initial structure 
of ARFBF is determined by a SVR approach, the ARFBF with 
ARLA have fast convergence speed and robust against outliers 
for the modeling of molecular autoregulatory feedback loop 
systems. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
There are a large number of factors that complicate the 
mathematical modeling of biological gene networks. Many 
complex interactions on the molecular scale have been 
reported in [1-2], which rely on the presence of specific 
factors that can either enhance or inhibit the expression of 
certain genes. McAdams and Arkin [1] point out that the time 
interval between the switching on of the first promoter and its 
effect on the next promoter can vary widely across otherwise 
identical cells, as a result of stochastic processes. 
Mechanisms put forward to explain the stochastic nature are, 
for instance, the degradation of gene products, the spatial 
collision necessary before a reagent can exert its influence, 
and the reversible reaction equations for e.g. dimerisation and 
reaction complex formation. For a cell to create less noisy 
output, it is necessary to produce more frequent transcripts 
with fewer proteins per transcript, which is related to a higher 
energy cost. Both McAdams and Arkin [1] and Szallasi [3]

argue that stochastic models are most likely to yield realistic 
results. Wagner [4] proposed a weight matrix model to study 
the effects of gene duplications on the organization of the 
genome. He states that duplication of several genes can alter 
the equilibrium expression pattern of network genes, while 
only duplication of the complete genetic network will not. 
Thieffry and Thomas [5] have examined how the nature of 
possible feedback loops present in genetic networks depends 
on the properties of these networks. The feedback loops may 
be denominated “positive” or “negative”, indicating the 
ultimate influence of one of the nodes in the loop on itself. 
This property can be easily calculated by multiplying the 
signs of the rates of influence of each subsequent genetic 
interaction. They find that the nature of the feedback loop is a 
necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the distinctive 
type of behavior in the system: negative feedback loops may 
give stable oscillatory behavior, while at least one positive 
regulatory circuit is necessary to generate multi-stationarity. 
In their study on the relationship between genomic regulatory 
element organization and gene regulatory dynamics, Wolf 
and Eeckman [6] showed that dynamical system behavior, 
stability of equilibria and their bifurcation potential can be 
largely determined from regulatory element organization. 
Their differential equations model is generalized from Shea 
and Ackers [7], who have in detail analyzed the gene network 
responsible for the switch from lysis to lysogeny in the 
lambda phage. The complex transcription level, promoter 
control model contains a number of interactions, such as 
promoter regulated transcription and RNA polymerase 
binding. It is assumed that the linear model represents 
prokaryotic gene networks, which are dominated by local 
promoter control by regulator proteins. 
Wahde and Hertz [8] followed Reinitz and Sharp [9] in 
modeling genetic networks as a set of nonlinear differential 
equations. Thus, they can search for parameters that indicate 
the rates of change of a certain gene, and the assumption of 
discrete time steps for the network’s next state is unnecessary. 
In stead, they used a GA to determine the time constants for 
each of the n nodes in the system. The other parameters were 
deduced similarly: nn×  gene interaction weights, and n 
bias terms. Because the use of GA’s can generate very 
different results in alternate runs, the generated parameter 
values were averaged over several runs of the algorithm; this 
also gave insight in the error in each parameter. To increase 
the amount of data from which to start network inference, 
D’Haeseleer et al. [10] started their analysis with the 
calculation of a non-linear interpolation curve of the gene 
expression time series data points. Though they used data 
from three different experiments, with very alternate 
time-scales (time intervals between measurements ranged

erroneous measurements or noisy data from the tail of noise 
distribution functions. When the outliers exist, there still exist 
some problems in the traditional fuzzy basis function 
approaches. Hence, the ARFBF approaches are proposed to 
overcome the problems of traditional fuzzy basis function 
approaches while facing outliers. Those robust approaches 
could indeed improve the learning performance when training 
data contain outliers. Nevertheless, in the use of robust 
learning algorithms, there also exist the problems of 
initialization (i.e. initial parameters in networks) and the 
selection of cut-of points (i.e. the rejected values of outliers) 
[18].

III. THE PROPOSED STRUCTURE FOR MODELING OF 
MOLECULAR AUTOREGULATORY FEEDBACK LOOP SYSTEMS 
WITH OUTLIERS 
The Proposed Structure for modeling of molecular 
autoregulatory feedback loop systems with outliers is 
illustrated in Fig. 3. There are two phases of learning in the 
approach; the initial learning phase and parameters learning 
phase. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach, so called 
the SVR as the initial learning phase, that can not only 
simultaneously identify the parameters in the premise parts 
and fuzzy singleton consequent parts without knowing the 
cluster number but also can have robust learning effects 
against noise and outliers. After an initial structure of FBF is 
obtained via the SVR, an ARLA learning algorithm is 
employed to refine the parameters of FBF in the parameters 
learning phase. That is, the ARLA learning algorithm is 
applied to adjust the parameters in the premise and fuzzy 
singleton consequent parts in the parameters learning phase. 
In view of the above problems, a novel approach, called the 
ARFBF, is proposed in this paper to cope with those 
problems. That is, the proposed ARFBF are shown in Fig. 3. 
In this approach, the initial structure of ARFBF is obtained by 
the SVR approach. Then, an ARLA is applied to adjust the 
parameters of Gaussian function and the synaptic weights.

IV. THE ANNEALING ROBUST FUZZY BASIS FUNCTION 
A. The initial structure of ARFBF by the SVR approach 
A SVR approach is to approximate an unknown function 
from a set of (input, output) samples ( ){ }Niyx ii ,...,1 ,, =G  
without learning. Assuming that a set of basis function 
( ){ }lixg i ,..,1 , =G  is given, there exists a family of functions 
that can be expressed as a linear expansion of the basis 
functions. Then, the problem of function approximation 
transforms into that finding the parameters of the following

where the η  is a learning constant, the ( )⋅ϕ  is usually called 
the influence function. When outliers exist, they have great 
impact on the approximated results. Such an impact can be 
understood through the analysis of the influence function. In 
the ARLA, the annealing schedule is using tkt /)( =β  for 
any t epoch, where the k is constants. When the decay is too 
quick, the approximation of the majority may not have 
enough time to converge and the training data may mostly be 
degraded. If the decay is too slow, the robust learning 
algorithm may not be in time to discriminate against those 
outliers before overfitting occurs. However, the suitable 
annealing schedule k/t has been found experimentally to 
achieve the best performance in the ARLA [18].  
V. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The simulations were conducted in the Matlab 
environment. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the 
testing data is used to measure the performance of the learned 
networks (generalization capability). The RMSE is defined as

τ =4h, m=3, n=5, and k=1. Assume the number of sampling 
data is 1000, the membership function is Gaussian function 
and the learning rate equals to 0.05. Besides, we add the noise 
with five outliers to the systems. Sum square error is 0.01 in 
the porposed structure. After the SVR, then the total number 
of rule is 252 and initial weights are determined in the 
proposed ARFBF. The training data sets are shown in Fig. 4. 
Besides, the MAFLS with outliers and initial with SVR are 
shown in figure 5. The final results for for the mRNA 
abundance and the protein abundance are shown in Fig. 6 and 
Fig. 7, respectively. From Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the finally results 
with proposed approach and training data set overlap together 
and robust against outliers. Besides, the learning epoch is not 
greater than 15 epochs to obtain Figs. 6 and 7. The RMSE 
versus epoch is shown in Fig. 8. On the contrary, when this 
function uses conventional robust fuzzy basis function with 
random weights to get Figs 6 and 7, it needs greater than 3500 
epochs. From these results, the proposed approach could 
indeed improve the learning performance.
