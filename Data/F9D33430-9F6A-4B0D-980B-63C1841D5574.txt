Abstract. 
Several global topological parameters are 
used to characterize PINs for seven species.  
It is found that the seven PINs are well de-
scribed by the scale-free networks and the hi-
erarchical models possibly except fruit fly.  In 
particular, it is determined that the E. coli 
and the yeast PINs are well represented by 
the stochastic and deterministic hierarchical 
network models respectively.  These results 
suggesting that the hierarchical network 
model is a better description for certain spe-
cies’ PINs, and it may not be an universal fea-
ture across different species. 
1. Introduction. 
Networks of interactions are fundamental to all biological 
processes; for example, the cell can be described as a 
complex network of chemicals connected by chemical 
reactions.  Cellular processes are controlled by various 
types of biochemical networks [1]; such as metabolic 
networks, protein-protein interaction networks (PINs), 
and gene regulatory networks. 
In the last few years, we began to see many pro-
gresses in analyzing biological networks using the ran-
dom network approach.  The random network approach 
had become a powerful tool for investigating different 
biological systems, such as the yeast protein interaction 
networks [2], food webs [3] and metabolic networks 
[4,5].  Many studies indicated that there are underlying 
global structures of those biological networks. 
Proteins perform distinct and well-defined func-
tions, but little is known about how interactions among 
them are structured at the cellular level.  Recently, it 
was reported that [6] the yeast protein-protein interac-
tion network is not a random network but well organ-
ized.  It was found that, most of the neighbors of highly 
connected proteins have few neighbors, that is highly 
connected proteins are unlikely to interact with each 
other.  Similarly, genetic regulatory network consists of 
a set of genes and their mutual regulatory interactions 
[7].  It was reported that [8] there is a hierarchical and 
combinatorial organization of the transcriptional activity 
pattern in the yeast organism.   
Our studies extend previous studies to a total of seven 
species, and it provides some evidence suggesting that 
there is underlying topological structures across different 
species.  Essentially, it is found that all the species’ PINs 
exhibit scale-free behavior, and in addition of the scale-
free behavior, there are some evidence indicated that some 
of species’ PINs also displayed modular structures, which 
can be better described by the hierarchical network model.  
 It is also demonstrated that PINs are quite robust with 
respect to failure, attack, random rewiring and edge dele-
tion, that is the average diameters for perturbed cases 
differ slightly from the unperturbed cases. These results 
suggest that PINs’ network topologies are robust against 
experimental artifacts.

formance with time or intervening events, and the learn-
ing process. 
To reduce fluctuations, we study the logarithm of 
the node degree cumulative distribution Pcum(k), vs the 
logarithm of k plot, where Pcum(k) is defined as [13]      
∑∞
=
=
kk
cum kPkP
'
)()( '                           (1) 
It is shown that Pcum(k) ~ k-α for the scale-free 
network [13], where α=γ-1. The second topological 
measurement is the average network distance between 
two nodes, which is given by the number of links along 
the shortest path.  For all pairs of proteins, the shortest 
interaction path length L can be determined by using the 
Floyd algorithm [14]. 
 
 
 
The average network diameter d is given by the 
average of the shortest path lengths over all pairs of 
nodes,

where L is the shortest path length and f(L) is the fre-
quency of nodes have a path length of L.   
The clustering coefficient for node i is defined by 
Ci(ki) = 2ni/ki (ki–1), where ni is the number of links 
connecting the ki neighbors of node i to each other, and 
Ci(ki) is equal to 1 for connected graph (also known as 
clique).  The average clustering coefficient for nodes 
with node degree k is defined by 
)(/)()( knkCkC i
kki
iave
i
∑
=∈
=                  (3) 
where n(k) denotes the total number of nodes with k links. 
The known properties of hierarchical networks are: 
scale-free distribution of node degrees, scaling of cluster-
ing coefficient of nodes with k links, and a large cluster-
ing coefficient C, which is defined as NkCC
k
ave /)(∑= , 
where N is the cardinality of the set of node degrees 
{1, ….kmax}, that is the number of members in the set.  It 
was shown that in deterministic scale-free networks the 
clustering coefficient of a node with k links is governed 
by the scaling law [15,16], that is Cave(k) ~ k-β, where β 
equals to 1. 
Several pieces of works had demonstrated that the 
hierarchical exponent β can be tuned as one tunes some 
of the network parameters, such as pa, which stands for 
fraction of the newly added nodes, therefore, a stochas-
tic version of the hierarchical model was proposed 
[16,17]. 
3.   Results 
In Table 2, we present the average node degree <k>, stan-
dard deviation of node degree σk, maximum connectivity 
kmax , and average network diameter d results for seven 
species. 
 
Table 2.  The average node degree <k>, standard deviation of node degree σk, maximum connectivity kmax , 
and average network diameter d results for seven species.

E. coli 2.17±3.31 54 5.63 
H. pylori 3.87±5.42 54 4.14 
C.elegans 3.02±7.19 187 4.81 
D. melanogaster 5.90±9.37 178 4.46 
M. musculus 1.68±1.40 12 3.57 
H. sapiens 2.49±2.99 33 6.80 
S.cervisiae(CORE) 4.87±6.07 111 5.01 
 
The average node degrees of PINs lie between 1.68 
and 5.90.  This means every protein has a few interactions 
on the average.  On the other hand, the maximum node 
degrees are much larger than <k> for the seven species, 
these results strongly indicate that PINs are not random 
networks.  The average network diameter d of the net-
works lies between 3.57 and 6.80 for any two proteins.  A 
larger d value means that any two proteins can have indi-
rect interaction via more successive protein interactions. 
In Figure 1(a)-(g), we plot the logarithm of the nor-
malized node degree cumulative distribution Log(Pcum(k)) 
as a function of the logarithm of node degree Log k, for 
the seven species.

coli, (d) H. pylori, (e) H.sapiens, (f) M. musculus and (g) S. cerevisiae (CORE), and their regression lines (the 
solid lines). 
 
It is evident from the figures that the number of 
proteins decrease with increasing number of connec-
tions, that is it has an inverse relation.  In other words, 
protein has multiple connections are rare.  The Log 
Pcum(k) vs. Log k plots indicate that PINs follow a power 
law (Pcum(k) ~ k-α) behavior.  It suggests that the PINs 
form a scale-free network.  The scale-free degree distri-
bution conclusion had been reported for C. elegans [19] 
and S. cerevisiae [6, 20] PINs.  We extend previous 
studies to a total of seven species.  
In Table 3, we present the regression and correla-
tion analysis results for the node degree distribution and 
the network diameters data. Regression analysis deter-
mine that α lies between 1.48 and 2.34 for the seven 
species.  Correlation analysis provides very good evi-
dence (p-value<<10-6) supporting the fact that the seven 
PINs form a scale-free network.  All the species have a 
r2 value larger than 0.90, and the closer r2 is to 1, the 
better it accounts for the correlation.

To further characterize the network topological 
structures, we compute the Cave(k), and consider the loga-
rithm of the Cave(k) vs. the logarithm of node degree k 
plots for the seven species.  In Table 4, we present the 
regression and correlation analysis results for the average 
clustering function Cave(k), the clustering coefficient C, 
and the C values for the species, C. elegans, D. 
melanogaster and S. cerevisiae, given by Ref. 21.

S. cerevisiae(CORE) 0.89±0.09 0.72 <<10-3 0.30  
S. cerevisiae    0.13 0.12 
 
Our study indicate that Cave(k) decreases with k for 
the seven species, as illustrate in Table 4 and Figures 2, 
and 3.  Regression analysis of the Log Cave(k) vs. Log k 
plots indicate that among the seven species only the yeast 
PIN is well represented by the deterministic hierarchical 
network model (Cave(k) ~ k-1) [15, 16, 17], because its β 
value is consistent with the model predication (from Table 
4, β=0.89±0.09 with a p-value <<10-6, which is rather 
significant), and it has a relative large clustering coeffi-
cient C.  The hierarchical structure conclusion and the 
clustering coefficient C result (the second last column of 
Table 4) for yeast are consistent with Ref. 21 results.  The 
E.coli PIN has a β value equals to 1.70 which is not quite 
consistent with the deterministic hierarchical network 
model predication.  One can interpret this finding in terms 
of the stochastic hierarchical network model; for β = 1.70, 
the E.coli PIN is better represented by the stochastic 
model with a pa value equals to 0.55, where we estimate it 
from Fig. 5b in Ref. 16.  Hierarchical network description 
implies the existence of underlying modular structures, 
hence a modular organization of biological functions. 
From Table 4, we also observe that the β values for 
the five species, C. elegans, D. melagonaster, H. pylori, H. 
sapiens, and M. musculus, are somewhat small and differ-

4.   Discussion and Conclusion 
Several global topological parameters are used to charac-
terize PINs.  We find that the seven PINs are well ap-
proximated by the scale-free networks and the hierarchi-
cal models possibly except fruit fly.  The current fruit-fly 
protein-protein interaction dataset do not have convincing 
evidence in favor of the hierarchical network model.  In 
particular, we determine that the E. coli and the yeast 
PINs are well represented by the stochastic and determi-
nistic hierarchical network models respectively.  These 
results suggesting that the hierarchical network model is a 
better description for certain species’ PINs, and it may not 
be an universal feature across different species.  We con-
jecture that PINs are better described by a hybrid model, 
that is a scale-free model for small k and a hierarchical 
model for large k.
