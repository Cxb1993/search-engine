Production of High-Content Isomaltooligosaccharides by 
Co-immobilized Transglucosidase and Pichia heimii 
Abstract 
Production of high-content IMO from maltose by immobilized transglucosidase (TG) and 
yeast cells was investigated. TG and Pichia heimii were co-immobilized onto calcium 
alginate particles. Through the catalytic reaction of TG, maltose was converted into IMO and 
glucose. Meanwhile, the yeast P. heimii fermented the glucose into alcohols and organic acids, with 
ethanol as the primary product. The substrate solution composed of 300 g/L sucrose and 1g/L yeast 
extract. The reaction was carried out at 30ºC and 100 rpm, and the pH of the reaction mixture 
was controlled at around 5.5 by automatic addition of a mixture of 100 g/L NaOH and 10 g 
L/ Ca(OH)2. After a 24-h reaction catalyzed by the particles of co-immobilized TG and yeast, a 
high-content IMO up to 92 % on a dry weight basis was obtained and value-added ethanol at 72 g/L 
was achieved.

1. Introduction 
Many oligosaccharides can stimulate the proliferation of bifidobacteria in intestine and thus 
promote human health [Steed and Macfarlane, 2009]. Among various functional 
oligosaccharides, IMO is acid stable and can be added to acidic drinks. And because the raw 
material for the production of IMO is starch, which is cheap and abundant, IMO is most 
prevalent in the market [Goffin
 
et al., 2011]. IMO comprises isomaltose, panose and other 
isomalto-oligomers. Generally, through the catalytic reactions of α , and β -amylases on 
starch, a syrup consisting mainly of maltose is obtained. IMO is produced through the 
catalytic reaction of transglucosidase (TG) on maltose. However, this is low-content IMO, 
which consists of large amounts of glucose and unreacted maltose as well as IMO. Glucose 
plus maltose account around one third of total sugars in low-content IMO syrup. This is 
because during the reaction the byproduct glucose is a competitive inhibitor for 
glucosyl-transferring reaction of TG and some maltose is remained unreacted. 
Co-immobilization of neo-fructosyltransferase and fungal cells onto calcium alginate 
particles for the production of neo-fructooligosaccharides has been investigated, in which the 
yield of oligosaccharides was enhanced due to the enriched activity of 
neo-fructosyltransferase [Lim et al., 2007]. In the present work, TG and cells of Pichia heimii 
were co-immobilized onto calcium alginate particles, which served as biocatalyst for the 
production of high-content IMO from maltose. Through the catalytic reaction of such particles 
on maltose, glucose was almost consumed by the yeast cells and maltose reacted more 
completely than that TG was used alone. Pichia heimii consumes only glucose, but not

in Figure 1. Ethanol, glycerol, and organic acids were analyzed by HPLC on an ICSep 
Ion-300 column (7.8×300 mm, Transgenomic, USA) with a refractive index detector. The 
mobile phase was 0.1% phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. Retention times for 
lactic acid, glycerol, acetic acid, and ethanol were 20.6, 21.2, 24.5, and 31.4 min, respectively. 
2.4. Assay of TG activity 
About 1 g of alginate particles in which enzyme and yeast cells were co-immobilized, were 
spread on filter paper to remove excess water. The particles were weighed and were added to 
a 100-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of 30% (w/v) maltose in 0.1M sodium acetate 
buffer (pH 5.5). After a 30-min reaction at 30ºC and 160 rpm, the reaction mixture was 
carefully withdrawn using a pippet and then was analysis by HPLC. One unit of TG activity 
was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce one micromole panose under the 
above-mentioned conditions. 
2.5 Batch-wise production of high-content IMO 
Batch-wise production of high-content IMO was carried out using a 2-L jar fermenter (MBF, 
Eyela) with a working volume of 1 L, at 30ºC and 100 rpm, and the pH of the reaction 
mixture was controlled at around 5.5 by automatic addition of a mixture of 100 g/L NaOH 
and 10 g L/ Ca(OH)2. The reaction was started by mixing 300 g maltose, 600 g biocatalyst 
particles, 1 g yeast extract and water to reach a volume of 1 L in the bioreactor. The 
batch-wise reaction was always terminated in 24 h. 
3. Results and discussion 
The effect of CaCl2 concentration on the efficiency of enzyme immobilization is shown in 
Figure 2. Immobilization of TG onto calcium alginate was optimized when 0.25 M CaCl2 
solution was used. About 92% of initial TG was trapped in calcium alginate gel. Table 1 
shows that higher activity of GT was observed at pH 4.5 compared with that at pH 5.0 and pH 
5.5. However, when repeated batch-wise reactions at pH 4.5, 5.0 and 5.5 were carried out, as 
shown in Figure 3, the biocatalyst was most stable at pH 5.5. Dramatic loss of TG activity 
was observed at pH 4.5. This might be because the lower the pH of the reaction mixture, the 
more TG and alginate were leached out from the particle. Table 2 shows the saccharide 
composition and ethanol concentration when various doses of TG were applied.  
Conclusion 
Co-immobilization of TG and yeast Pichia heimii can be applied for the production of 
high-content IMO from maltose, in which Pichia heimii fermented the byproduct glucose 
mainly into ethanol. Therefore, considerable amounts of ethanol was obtained during the 
production of high-content IMO.
