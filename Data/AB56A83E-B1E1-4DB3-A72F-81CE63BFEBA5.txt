Thin films of p-type nickel oxide (NiO) were prepared by a sol-gel spin deposition on 
ITO/TiO2 to fabricate all-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. The Ni(OH)2 sol was formed from 
nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate, Ni(CH3COO)2．4H2O, in a mixture of alcohol solution and 
poly(ethylene glycol), and followed by different heat treatments in air (350~800 °C). The 
formation and composition of NiO thin film was verified by EDX and X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
analysis, which shows preferred orientation along the (111) plane. The thickness of the NiO film 
calcined at 450 °C for 1 h is 120.6 nm with average grain size of 22 nm, and high UV 
transparency (~75%) in the visible region is observed. The electrical properties of the sol-gel NiO 
films such as hole carrier concentration, sheet resistance and carrier mobility were examined 
using Hall measurement. Results show that the Hall mobility is dominated by the hole 
concentration. Furthermore, all-solid-state solar cells comprising n-TiO2/p-NiO composite 
electrode were fabricated and the performance was evaluated. The current-voltage (I-V) 
characteristics of the composite TiO2/NiO electrode in dark demonstrate a good rectifying curve, 
verifying the p-type behavior of NiO films. Solar cells when sensitized with Ru-dye (N719) 
demonstrate short-circuit photocurrent (ISC) of 0.33 mA/cm2 and open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) 
of 210 mV; the conversion efficiency is about 0.025%.

conversion efficiency were reported to be 47.6% and 0.032%, respectively [17], where the NiO 
thin film was formed by dipping combined with doctor blade method, and the thickness was 
roughly measured to be ~1.2 nm. In this study, we report a simple sol-gel method combined with 
calcinations to prepare p-type NiO thin films. The structural and optical properties of the NiO are 
investigated, and its electrical properties are evaluated by Hall measurement. In addition, I-V 
characteristics of all-solid-state DSSCs constructed with n-TiO2/p-NiO composite electrode in the 
dark and under 1-sun illumination (air mass, AM 1.5) are investigated, and the conversion 
efficiency is evaluated. 
 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Preparation of NiO thin film and cell fabrication 
 Indium tin oxide coated glass was used as transparent conducting substrate with the sheet 
resistance of 7 Ω/□. The ITO glasses received wet chemical cleaning before use by sonication in 
methanol and de-ionized water for 10 min, respectively. It was then rinsed with distilled water 
and dried with N2. After the coating of two TiO2 layers, the thickness of the TiO2 film was about 
7 μm determined by a stylus surface roughness detector (Alpha step 200). 
 
The NiO sol was formed from 0.5 M nickel (II) acetate tetrahydrate, Ni(CH3COO)2．4H2O, 
in a mixture of alcohol solution and poly(ethylene glycol). The poly(ethylene glycol) is a additive 
material to improved the adhesion and hardness of the films, which provides a suitable mixture of 
sols. Subsequently, ammonia aqueous solution NH3OH (4~9 wt%) was added drop-wise into the 
mixture until a clear and blue mixed solution is formed. The Ni(OH)2 sol was further aged at 
room temperature for 24 h, then was deposited in air at two steps with different spinning speed, 
which are 800 rpm and 4800 rpm both for 30 sec. Finally, the coated films were dried at 200 °C 
in an oven to remove H2O and chemical residue followed by calcinations in air at varied 
temperatures of 350, 450, 550, 650 and 800 °C for 1 h. Then the composite p-n electrode was 
fabricated by spin coating p-type NiO oxides onto n-type TiO2 layer. The composite p-n 
electrodes were immersed in a solution of Ru 719 dye (2,2’bipyridine-4-COOH,4’-COO- 
ruthenium (II)). 
orientation (111) with the hexagonal structure. The transmittance spectra of the NiO films 
received different heat treatment is shown in Fig. 3. The results indicate that the NiO film (450 °C) 
shows highest transparency (~75%) in the visible region. In contrast, UV transparency in the NiO 
films (50 and 200 °C) is mush lower due to the amorphous characteristics. 
 
3.2 Electrical properties of p-NiO films—Hall effect measurement 
 Fig. 4 shows the results of Hall effect measurement of NiO thin films at various calculation 
temperatures. It is clearly seen that the resistivity, Hall coefficient, carrier concentration and 
mobility variation are dependent on calcinations temperatures. The resistivity of the NiO films 
decreases with increase of temperatures in the range of 350~650 °C, indicating the negative 
temperature coefficient resulting from the semiconductor properties of NiO [20]. The large 
increase of resistivity for NiO calcined at 800 °C may be due to decrease in carrier mobility as 
shown in Fig. 4(b). For the NiO calcined at 450 °C, the carrier concentration of and Hall mobility 
of are measured to be 5.7x1020 cm-3 and 24.1 cm2/V-sec, respectively. The highest carrier 
concentration is 8.86x1020 cm-3 (650 °C) corresponding to the highest mobility of 28.7 cm2/V-sec.  
 
3.3 Electrical characterization of TiO2/NiO electrode and DSSC 
 The dark I-V characteristics of the devices constructed with single TiO2 layer, TiO2/dye and 
TiO2/NiO in the forward and reverse bias are shown in Fig. 5. It is found that single TiO2 layer 
and TiO2/dye reveal a high-resistance junction behavior by demonstrating poor rectification 
slopes. The absence of the diode characteristics in TiO2/dye electrode has been explained from 
the viewpoint of electron transfer [1, 17]. Enhanced rectification of the TiO2/NiO composite 
electrode was observed as compared to the structures of single TiO2 layer and TiO2/dye.  
 
The effect of calcination temperature on the I-V characteristics of TiO2/NiO junction is also 
investigated. As seen in Fig. 6, the NiO film calcined at 350 °C shows onset voltage of 4 V and 
poor rectification behavior; however, the films received heat treatment at 450 °C and 550 °C 
exhibit significant junction behavior with greater rectification slope, and the onset voltage is 
reduced to the range of 2~2.5V and. The rectification slope is as high as 1.37 mA/V and the

Abstract 
In this work, the influence of Si/SiO2 interface properties, interface nitridation and 
remote-plasma-assisted oxidation (RPAO) thickness (<1 nm), on electrical performance and 
TDDB characteristics of sub-2nm stacked oxide/nitride gate dielectrics has been investigated 
using a constant voltage stress (CVS). It is demonstrated that interfacial plasma nitridation 
improves the breakdown and electrical characteristics due to the suppression of hole traps at the 
Si/SiO2 interface evidenced by less negative Vt shifts. Interface nitridation also reduced off-state 
drain leakage by retarding hole tunneling between the gate and drain as evidenced by gate current 
coinciding with off-state drain current. 
 
In addition, the RPAO thickness of stacked gate dielectrics shows a profound effect in 
device performance and TDDB reliability. It is demonstrated that TDDB characteristics are 
improved for both PMOS and NMOS devices with thinner RPAO layer (0.6 nm) as compared to 
0.8-nm RPAO device using Weibull analysis. The maximum operating voltage is projected to be 
~0.3 V difference for a 10-year lifetime. However, physical breakdown mechanism and effective 
defect radius during stress appear to be independent of RPAO thickness from the observation of 
the Weibull slopes. A correlation between trap generation and dielectric thickness changes based 
on the C-V distortion and oxide thinning model is presented to clarify the trapping behavior in the 
RPAO and bulk nitride layer. The location of trap generation between source and drain during 
stressing is further analyzed by the partition gate leakage model. Detailed experimental data are 
presented and reveal that the neutral traps are uniformly created along the channel in the initial 
stage of stress; however, after an increasing amount of electrical stress, more traps are generated 
and move towards the drain under normal operation mode, especially for shorter channel. The 
extraction of the effective mobility is suggested to include 50%-gate leakage current (Ig), and 
experimental results show that this correction is valid for high gate leakage current up to 2 A/cm2.
