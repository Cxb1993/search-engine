operational failure. CUSUM chart cumulates the deviation of target level with time 
but the assumption of CUSUM chart is data independent of time. Business operational 
data are time autocorrelated. Therefore before applying CUSUM chart, we use the 
vector autoregressive (VAR) model to eliminate the effect of time autocorrelation 
among data. The theory of discriminant analysis (DA) can simplify multivariate 
CUSUM into univariate CUSUM. We apply a real entertainment community website 
database to demonstrate its effectiveness. There are five operational (non-financial) 
variables extracted from the viewpoints of some experienced managers of web 
companies and related literatures. Managers and investors are more concerned about 
the deterioration of business operation. In this paper, we only display the CUSUM 
chart with lower limit. The crisis of a company does not occur abruptly but over a 
period of time. The CUSUM model is more sensitive than static prediction models, 
because it can cumulate the structural changes of quality in business operation. When 
the signal cumulation has statistical significance then CUSUM chart will give alert. 
We may have enough time to remedy the situation of deterioration at the time of 
warning signal. However, most of the static models can only give classification result 
when failure really occurs. It is sometimes too late to remedy the failure or stop the 
extension of failure. Therefore, timing is the most important factor for prediction 
models. The sooner we can get the accurate worsening signal of business operation, 
the better and more efficient the prediction model is. The result of this research shows 
that when we extract five operational variables and apply the multivariate cumulative 
sum model (CUSUM), it only takes eight days to predict the turning point and trends 
of the worsening operational conditions when the actual operational crisis begins to 
occur. From our real-life experimental case, the CUSUM prediction system excels in 
warning managers in advance of the need to timely adjust their operational strategies. 
The CUSUM prediction system is built by VB.net and some calculations are used by 
software packages EViews 5.0, Minitab 14.0 and MatLab2006.  
 
2. Multivariate CUSUM on Autocorrelated Data 
Methods for dealing with Autocorrelated data in the statistical process control 
environment have been suggested by several authors. For example, see Alwan and 
Roberts (1989); Montgomery and Mastrangelo (1991); Theodossiou (1993); and 
Kahya and Theodossiou (1999). All their works are to fit an appropriate time-series 
model to the observations and then apply control charts to the stream of residuals 
from this model. In this research, we also follow the same philosophy. Let 
be a stationary vector of p attribute variables at time t with 
predictive ability in business execution distress. The sequence of attribute vectors

The univariate variable  is a linear combination of random variable tZ tε . If random 
variable tε  is normal distributed, the variable  is also normal distributed. The 
expected value of  is  when  is in good performance state. Otherwise, 
the expected value of  is  when  is in bad performance state. The 
variance of  is 1 regardless whether  is in a good or bad state. We can 
substitute variable  into univariate CUSUM and use the general recommendations 
shown in Table 1 for the parameter given, H = 4 or 5 if

3. Business Operational Variables and Model Application 
to make friends from the website. Among the members, 68% are students. Figure 1 is 
the consumption amount from July to October. We can observe an obvious drop from 
August to September. It is reasonable because students will increase their 
extracurricular activities during summer vacation and reduce in fall. All the other four 
variables defined in the CUSUM Prediction System have the same declining trend 
from August to September as that of consumption amount. We simulate the period 
from July 1, 2004 to August 31, 2004 as the good performance state and the period 
from September 1 to 20, 2004 as the bad performance state. There are 62 good 
samples and 20 bad samples. We use the correlation ratio (also called eta square 2E ) 
to measure the error deduction rate between good state to bad state (Kenney and 
Keeping, 1951). The eta square value for each variable is listed in Table 2. In Table 2, 
the eta square values of variable Hours, Visits and Consumption are more than 10%. 
It shows these three variables have significant distinguish between good period and 
bad period. The last two variables, Consumers and Purchases, are less than 10% in 
these 82 data (from July 1 to September 20). But if we use the data from July to 
October, their eta square values are 0.2392 and 0.1159, respectively. Therefore, we 
think variable Consumers and Purchases are also significant variables. Our model will 
include all these five

0.608 and 0.955, respectively. The average and standard deviation of  to  
(for bad period) are  and 1.122, respectively. The CUSUM drew by CUSUM 
Prediction System for 57 samples from the good period and for the 20 bad samples 
are exhibited in Figure 3. The target value is 0.608. The CUSUM type is one-sided 
and CUSUM plan is H = 4 and k = 0.5. As seen Figure 3, we observe that the 
CUSUM shifting down quickly from period 63 and being out of the lower control 
limit from period 66. We choose H=4. If CUSUM value

the mean shift.

Only eight runs we get the out of control signal in our real-life experimental case. The 
Prediction System shows excellent performance in predicting degeneration.
