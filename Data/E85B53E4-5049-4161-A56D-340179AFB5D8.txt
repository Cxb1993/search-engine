Abstract 
As data traffic increase rapidly, IP over WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) transport will replace 
conventional SONET transport in current metropolitan area networks. Such networks will require new 
MAC protocols to efficiently share network bandwidth among multiple network nodes. This research 
 4
Hornet, and so on [6-10] adopted the slotted WDM ring architecture; the literatures in [11-14] adopted 
the unslotted WDM ring architecture which definitely matches better with IP traffic. Besides, the packet 
switching is also an important topic in optical network, and it can be divided into Optical Circuits 
Switching (OCS), Optical Burst Switching (OBS), and Optical Packet Switching (OPS). OCS is a coarse 
switching technology; the number of the available wavelength is constrained and the wavelength routing 
is not the ideal switching paradigm to realize All Optical Networks (AON). OBS aggregates a lot of 
asynchronous packets into a synchronous burst packet and increases the end-to-end delay. Recently the 
study on packet switching is focused on OPS and OBS. This paper will propose a novel transmission 
scheduling algorithm to handle the variable size IP packet over the unslotted WDM Metro ring network. 
 
2. Network Architecture and CSMA/ID MAC Protocol 
2.1 The Network Architecture 
The network architecture used in this paper is a single, unidirectional fiber ring network, which 
connects an N number of nodes. The optical fiber is composed of W data channels (λ1, λ2, λ3,…, λw), as 
shown in Figure 1. The network scope is assumed to cover a metropolitan area (i.e., a ring circumference 
of about 100 km), so the system is referred to as a WDM metro ring. The Access Points (APs) connect 
LANs to the MAN ring network, while PoP connects the MAN to the WAN. Each data channel makes 
use of one specific wavelength to convey the optical signal. Therefore, using WDM technology, 
channels can work independently without interfering with each other. Logically, the network can be 
treated as a multi-ring network. 
The node structure of the network is shown in Figure 2. Each node has one tunable transmitter and W 
fixed receivers, one for each data channel. For the optical signal sent from upstream nodes, a splitter is 
used to tap off a small portion of the optical power from the ring to the receivers. Every receiver detects 
the optical signal carried in its corresponding wavelength within the output branch from the splitter for 
node address identification. If the destination address in the incoming packet header matches the node 
address, the packet data is sent to the host. Meanwhile, the MAC control scheme is signaled to activate 
the opening of the on-off switch for the corresponding data channel in order to remove the received 
packet carried in the major portion of the optical signal through the delay line. If the node is not the 
packet’s destination, the detected packet is ignored and the process of scanning the next packet is started.

2.3 Three Transmission algorithms for CSMA/ID MAC Protocol 
2.3.1 First in First out Queueing (FIFO) Scheduling 
In FIFO queue architecture, the packet that first arrived will be first service. The MAC controller 
monitors all channels to get the information of ACL, which is larger  or equal than the length of the 
first packet in FIFO queue. If ACLs more than one then select among based on the ACL algorithms and 
transmit the first packet on the ACL by selected; otherwise, the first packet has to remain in the buffer 
(electronic memory) of the TX-queue until a sufficient ACL is arrived. By this way, the packet collision 
can be avoided but the Head-of-Line (HoL) will pull the throughput down.  
2.3.2 OPF_CA Scheduling Scheduling 
In order to solve the HoL of FIFO scheduling, this paper proposes a scheduling algorithm OPF_CA 
(Optimal Packet First based on Carrier Avoidance) to increase the system throughput. In the algorithm, 
the MAC controller picks up a packet which length approaches the M-ACL when the HoL was happen; 
afterward the packet will be transmitted on the M-ACL space. However, if all packets in the queue are 
bigger than the M-ACL, the MAC controller will not put any packet on the M-ACL space. Fig.4 
illustrates a 512-byte packet transmits onto the M-ACL space. Although the algorithm overcomes the 
HoL problem, it requires more operations to maintain the status information of packets in queue.

3. Performance Evaluation 
3.1 Approximate Analytical Models 
The transfer delay of a packet measured from when the packet is completely stored in the source node 
queue until that packet has been completely received by the destination node. This delay consists of 
queuing delay, transmission delay and propagation delay. The queuing delay of a packet is measured 
from when a packet is fully stored in a queue of the source node to the time the source node was last 
selected by the queue before successful transmission. Meanwhile, in this investigation, the transmission 
delay is defined as the interval between the source node selecting the queue to transmit the packet 
successfully and the time the source node last selected the queue before transmitting the packet 
successfully. Finally, the propagation delay of a packet is the interval between the time that the last bit of 
the packet reaches the destination and the moment that the last bit of the packet was transmitted. From 
the behavior of the expected queuing delay for the ith packet, the model can be categorized as an M/G/1 
queue with vacations model [16]. Clearly, the queuing delay captures the effect of contention and is 
dependent on traffic density. In order to present expressions for packet transfer delay at a node on 
multi-rings using an M/G/1 vacation model, we first present some assumptions and the general notation 
to be used in various subsections. 
(1). Assumptions. For simplicity, the following assumptions are made: 
1. The number of WDM channels is W. 
2. The total propagation delay of the WDM ring is τ seconds, and the distances between the nodes       
are equal. 
3. Packets which arrive are independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) Poisson process with rate    
iλ (packets/second) at each of the N nodes on the ring, and with aggregate arrival rate for the 
network of ∑−

4. The arrival stream of packets at node i destined for node ji⊕  is a Poisson process with rate of    
jii ⊕,λ , where ⊕ indicates addition modulo N; thus ∑−

and symmetric traffic on the ring, it indicates that the mean packet generation for all nodes is 
equal and each source sends equal traffic to all destinations.

5. The packets have random lengths determined at each node as independent, identically and     
geometrically distributed random variables (denoted by the r.v. M(bits)) with mean E[M] and 
probability mass function [11] K,2,1,0,)1()( =−⋅== kkMP kr ββ  where

The steady-state duration of all the whole vacation intervals V is equal to λiTQ⋅E[d], and combining 
equations (3) and (6) we obtain the average queuing delay

Because the packet transfer delay is comprised of the queuing delay, transmission delay and 
propagation delay, the average packet transfer delay is 
D = TQ + S + τ’                              (9) 
where τ’ is the average propagation delay from a source node to a destination node, which is often 
expressed as τ / 2. The average transmission delay is

Thus, the average transfer delay is given by

3.3 Analysis of the multi-ring (WDM ring) case 
 
In order to analyze the multiple WDM ring networks, it is assumed that the bridge traffic load from the 
upstream source is equally distributed among W rings. To simplify the analysis, let the circulation of 
slots on W rings be synchronized [17-18]. That is, a node can observe W MTU on different rings at the 
same time. Since the bridge traffic load from the upstream source is uniformly distributed among the W 
rings, the average bridge traffic load of each ring, ρB, can be expressed as 
WBiB /ρρ =                                   (12) 
The probability that the packet at the head of a queue cannot get an empty MTU among the currently 
passing W MTUs is (ρB)W. Therefore, the probability that the packet has to wait i MTUs before it can be

5. Conclusion 
In summary, in this paper we have investigated a novel MAC protocol for all optical WDM ring 
networks. The protocol supports the transmission of IP packets directly over WDM from LAN to MAN. 
Meanwhile, the investigation has been made about how to merge and collapse the middle layers between 
IP and WDM for next generation optical LANs/MANs. There are three packet scheduling algorithms are 
discussed and analyzed. For verification, a simulation program obtains simulated results for the network, 
and the simulated results closely resemble the analytical values, and this demonstrates the performance 
of the network. The throughput of the fragmented packet scheme is better than that of the complete 
packet scheme. It is also observed that the throughput characteristic of the network is almost 
proportional to the number of channels in the network. With regards to the utilization of bandwidth of all 
the optical ring networks, our protocol displays the excellent characteristics of high throughput and low 
delay for all optical communications.
