Abstract 
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a known endocrine disrupting 
chemical that exists extensively in many environmental 
area and has shown adverse effects to aquatic organisms. 
It was detected in the water, suspended particulate matter 
(SPM), and bed sediment collected from several sites in 
a WuLo constructed wetland in southern Taiwan. 
Analytes were recovered from water samples by Solid 
Phase Extraction (SPE) on an EN cartridge. Samples of 
SPM and bed sediment were first extracted with a 
nonionic surfactant Tween 80 and extracted solutions 
were recovered from the supernatant by SPE on a C18 
cartridge and analyzed by High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. 
Concentrations of BPA in water ranged from 0.29 to 3.93
μg l-1, between 4.61 and 35.4μg g-1 in the SPM and 
between 1.01 and 1.42μg g-1 in the bed sediment in the 
upper site. BPA concentrations were from less than the 
limit of detection (<LOD) to 1.75μg l-1 in water, 
between 8.24 and 161μg g-1 in the SPM and between 
0.61 and 0.76μg g-1 in bed sediment in the lower site. 
The BPA concentrations in the SPM were much higher 
than in the bed sediment. Biodegradation of BPA did not 
occur from the upper site to the middle site at a hydraulic 
retention time of 1.5 days but it did occur from the 
middle site to the lower site. Although concentration of 
BPA decreased in the aqueous phase, we presume that 
the possible biodegradation mechanism occurred in the 
SPM. During two sampling periods the BPA degradation 
ratios were 43 and 45% at a hydraulic retention time of 
3.4 days with a corresponding mass removal rate of 1.92 
and 0.41μg l-1, respectively. 
Keywords: constructed wetland, biodegradation, EDCs,

一、Introduction 
Bisphenol A (BPA) is an important industrial 
chemical compound and is a necessary material 
used in the production of polycarbonates, 
epoxy resins, and other plastics and fungicides. 
Consumption of BPA is increasing worldwide. 
However, BPA is one of the known endocrine 
disrupting chemicals and is moderately toxic to 
aquatic organisms (Kang et al., 2006; Maffini 
et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2004; Staples et al., 
1998). The adverse effects of BPA on human 
and aquatic organisms have caused global 
concern (Maffini et al., 2006; Kang et al., 
2007). 
BPA exists in several environmental areas with 
substantially variable concentrations. Generally, 
concentrations of surface water and effluent in a sewage 
treatment plant (STP) were less than 1μg l-1. However, 
concentrations of leachates from industrial waste, 
municipal waste, and landfills were substantially higher. 
BPA general properties 
BPA log Kow is 3.32–3.82, water solubility is 120-300 
mg l-1, and is not a persistent organic compound (Staples 
et al., 1998; Klecka et al., 2001). The biodegradation 
half-life is variable and affected by many factors, such as 
temperature, bacterial counts, and others; reported values 
ranged from 2 to 7 days (Staples et al., 1998; Klecka et 
al., 2001; Kang and Kondo, 2002a; Kang and Kondo, 
2002b). Generally, the efficiency with which a 
wastewater treatment plant can remove BPA 
concentration ranged from 37 to 94% (Lee and Peart, 
2000), leaving some untreated BPA in the receiving 
water. However, BPA degradation efficiency is very slow 
in seawater and anaerobic conditions (Ying & Kookana, 
2005, Kang & Kondo, 2005, Voordeckers et al., 2002). In 
different environmental areas, degradation efficiency and 
half-life is substantially variable. For example, Kang and 
Kondo (2002b) investigated BPA degradation efficiency 
in 11 different kinds of river water, in which BPA was 
degraded in 10 but the removal rate was highly variable 
 1
                                                                   
(Model D7000, Japan) was used in this study, which 
consisted of an autosampler (Model L-7200), a solvent 
delivery system (Model D-7100), and a fluorescence 
detector (Model L-7485). This instrument was equipped 
with a reversed phase column (Inertsil PH, 5μm, 4.6 × 
150 mm I.D.) from GL Science, Japan. For BPA analysis, 
the fluorescence detector setting was 275 nm excitation 
and 300 nm emission. The mobile phase for gradient 
elution was Me and Milli-Q water was delivered at a 
constant flow rate of 1 ml min-1. The gradient program of 
the mobile phase was as follows: 60% Me and 40% 
water at 0 min, 80% Me and 20% water at 25 min, 60% 
Me and 40% water at 30 min and isocratic purge until 40 
min. The total run time for HPLC analysis was 40 min. 
The injection volume of standards and samples was 20μ
l. The extracts were quantified by calibration curves of 
the external standards. The detection limit was 0.037μg 
l-1 for BPA. 
Statistical analysis: All analyses were carried out using 
S-PLUS V 6.2 (Insightful, USA). Statistical significance 
was accepted at p=0.05 for all comparison. Prior to 
analysis, the data set was found to lack variance 
homogeneity or not to have a normal distribution, it was 
analyzed using a nonparametric test. Differences in BPA 
concentrations of water samples between the 1st sampling 
and 2nd sampling from each sampling site were analyzed 
with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (non paired data). 
Comparisons of BPA concentrations of water samples 
among the different sampling sites (creek water, upper, 
middle, and lower sites) for the 1st and 2nd water samples 
were carried by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Comparisons of 
BPA concentrations among different sampling sites 
(upper, middle, and lower sites) for SPM samples in the 
2nd sampling (both volume and mass base) were carried 
out by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Subsequent 
multiple-comparison tests were carried out using a 
procedure that is similar to the Turkey method, followed 
by an ANOVA (Aczel and Sounderpandian, 2002) for 
further analysis. 
三、Results 
1. Occurrence of BPA in WuLo wetland 
Concentrations of BPA in the 1st and 2nd sampling 
periods at the different sites are listed in Table 1. BPA 
concentrations in water ranged form <LOD (0.037μg l-1) 
to 14.44μg l-1. There were 49 samples greater than LOD 
which indicated a 72% frequency of detection. All of 
SPM samples contained BPA. The volume-based BPA 
concentrations in SPM ranged from 0.083 to 1.253μg l-1 
and the mass-based BPA concentrations ranged from 
4.61 to 161μg g-1. All six bed sediment samples 
contained BPA and concentrations ranged from 0.54 to 
1.42μg g-1. 
2. Comparison BPA concentration among different sites 
The BPA concentration mean and standard deviations in 
water are shown from the two sampling periods and four 
sites in Figure 2. In the 1st sampling period, there were 
only two creek water samples indicted with a mean value 
and no comparison was made. Comparison 
concentrations in the other three sites were not 
significantly different between the upper and middle sites. 
However, concentrations in the upper and middle sites 
were significantly greater than concentrations in the 
lower site (p=0.002). In the 2nd sampling period, 
comparison concentrations in the four sites showed a 
similar trend to the 1st sampling period; concentrations 
were not significantly different among the creek water, 
upper, and middle sites and concentrations in the upper 
site were greater than concentrations in the lower site 
(p<0.001). In the 1st sampling period, the middle site had 
one 14.44μg l-1 sample that caused a high standard 
deviation. In each sampling period, concentrations were 
not significantly different among the creek water, upper 
site, and middle sites. BPA concentrations in the 1st 
sampling period were higher than concentrations in 2nd 
sampling period in upper sites (p<0.001). 
3. BPA concentrations in SPM. 
In 1st sampling period, the volume base for each site had 
only two samples with a mean value so no comparison 
was made. In 2nd sampling period, each site had six 
samples that with mean and standard deviations (Figure 
3). There was no significant difference among the upper, 
middle, and lower sites (p=0.653). The SPM BPA 
concentration mass base during the 1st and 2nd sampling 
periods are shown in Figure 4. Concentrations in the 
upper site were significantly less than concentrations in 
the middle site. Concentrations were not significantly 
different between the middle and lower sites and between 
the upper site and the lower site (p=0.006). 
4. BPA concentration in bed sediment 
The mean concentrations of bed sediment from the 1st 
sampling period are shown in Figure 5. Mean 
concentration in the upper site was greater than mean 
concentrations in the middle and lower sites. Mean 
concentrations were 1.22, 0.62, and 0.68μg g-1 in upper, 
middle, and lower sites, respectively. 
四、Discussion 
1. BPA concentrations in water, SPM, and bed 
sediment 
In the upper site (Table 3), wetland water is heavily 
polluted, has low dissolved oxygen (DO), high NH3-N, 
high total organic carbon (TOC), and high SS. In the 
lower site, concentrations of NH3-N, SS, and TOC had 
decreased but concentrations of DO were even less than 
in upper site. This indicated that the wetland was capable 
of improving the water quality but there were still 
materials which consumed oxygen, causing the low DO. 
Concentrations of BPA in the 1st sampling period were 
greater than concentration in 2nd, which indicated a 
variation of contamination in the environmental 
partitions. Concentrations in the 1st sampling period in 
the upper site (mean 3.50μg l-1) were greater than 
concentrations measured in other rivers (Kolpin et al., 
2002; Fromme et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004; 
Patrolecco et al., 2006). Concentrations in the 2nd 
sampling period were comparable to other rivers but the 
mean concentration (0.46μg l-1) ranked higher than 
other measured ranges. Concentrations of BPA in SPM 
mass base ranged from 4.61 to 161μg g-1, especially 
high concentrations occurred in the middle and lower 
 3
                                                                   
was slightly higher than 1st sampling period, the removal 
mass rate was 1.92μg l-1 in 1st sampling period and was 
0.41μg l-1 in 2nd sampling period. Total mass removal 
efficiency was affected by concentration of micro 
organics in this wetland; the higher concentration 
material had higher mass removal efficiency. Some 
researches have reported that BPA was not a persistent 
compound. A reported half life of BPA biodegradation 
was between 2 and 7 days (Staples et al., 1998; Klecka et 
al., 2001; Kang and Kondo, 2002a; Kang and Kondo, 
2002b). In this study total degradation was 43 and 45% 
complete in 3.4 day hydraulic retention time. We can 
conclude that the half life was comparable to reported 
values. 
Conclusion 
BPA concentrations investigated in water, SPM, and bed 
sediment of the WuLo wetland in different sites showed 
that the WuLo wetland was capable of removing BPA. In 
a 3.4 day hydraulic retention time, degradation ratios 
were between 43 and 47% which were close to the 
reported half life. Degradation occurred in the section 
between the middle and lower sites,  confirming that 
BPA biodegradation needed a lag time.
