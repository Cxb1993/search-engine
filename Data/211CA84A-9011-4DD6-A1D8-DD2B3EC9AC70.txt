Abstract 
This project demonstrates the effective 
coupling between a single-mode fiber (SMF) 
and an edge emitting laser diode (LD) using a 
semi-ellipsoid microlens on the SMF endface. 
The semi-ellipsoid microlens was fabricated 
using photolithography, thermal reflow, mold 
electroforming and polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS) injection. UV-curing glue was 
smeared and exposed to fasten the lens onto 
the fiber. Low loss, wide misalignment 
tolerance and low manufacturing cost could be 
achieved. The optical simulation-software 
“TracePro” was used to predict the coupling 
efficiency parameters for the LD to SMF. 
“Taguchi method” was used for the parameter 
design concept to improve product quality 
searching for the optimal lens design. The 
proposed method facilitates mass production 
to achieve a high-yield and high-coupling 
method that is suitable to be used in the 
commercial fiber transmission industry. 
Keywords: Single-mode fiber, semi-ellipsoid 
microlens, Taguchi method, efficient coupling 
 
 
1 Introduction 
The large future optical networks 
implementation will induce a growing demand 
for optical data transmission systems. The 
development of low cost, high density 
packaged interconnection devices is therefore 
essential. Laser diodes have become 
increasingly more attractive in a wide range of 
applications. The most important impact of 
laser diodes is transmission systems for 
optical telecommunications, where laser 
diodes are required to achieve high 
transmission capacity and distance. Among 
the various types of single-mode laser diodes 
the “edge-emitting” type laser diodes most 
commonly used in commercial transmission 
systems. “Edge-emitting” type laser diodes 
have output beams with elliptical cross 
sections and some associated astigmatism. 
This elliptical configuration causes problems 
in many applications. Understanding the 
special characteristics of diode radiation, 
including beam divergence and angular 
asymmetry, is fundamental to practical design. 
However, the size, weight, and cost of the 
optical elements must also be considered. 
Laser diode and fiber coupling with tapered 
fibers has been proposed [1]. This mismatch is 
the reason for the very low coupling 
efficiency of 10%. This low efficiency can be 
overcome by the adoption of two optical mode 
fields with lenses. In these tapered fibers, the 
fiber endface is hemispherically tapered 
providing coupling efficiency more than 35% 
in [2]. To relax these tolerances and gain 
higher coupling efficiency, a wedge-shaped 
fiber endface was developed achieving 47% 
coupling efficiency compared to 20% for the 
determine the best levels based on an 
orthogonal array (OA). An orthogonal array is 
a fractional factorial matrix that assures a 
balanced comparison of levels for any factor 
or interaction of factors. Assuming an 
orthogonal array of strength t  is expressed 
by a matrix of j rows and i columns that 
makes , given that each . 
When setting in each by  sub-matrix 
of all possible rows occurs the same 
number 
j
ia }110{  ,...,q-, a

λ of times, clearly [15]. Such 
an array is denoted by OA (j, i, q, t), in which 
all possible combinations of symbols in any 
array of strength t  appear with equal 
frequency [16]. Taguchi’s arrays have an 
orthogonal strength of 2. This means that only 
the first-order effects of each factor can be 
assessed independently assuming that there 
are no second or higher order interactions. The 
orthogonal array is a method for setting up 
experiments that require only a fraction of the 
full factorial combinations. The treatment 
combinations are chosen to provide sufficient 
information to determine the factor effects 
using the analysis of means (ANOM). 
Orthogonal refers to the balance between the 
various combinations of factors so that no one 
factor is given more or less weight in the 
experiment than the other factors. Orthogonal 
also refers to the fact that the effect of each 
factor can be mathematically assessed 
independently of the effect of the other 
factors.  
jq t =λ
With negligible interactions between the 
control factors, the S/N effects can be 
modeled by simply adding the main effects 
from each control factor. This is referred to as 
an additive model, which takes on the 
following from 
error)()()(predict +⋅+−+−+−+= yyyyyyyy CBA        
Where y  is the overall average response for 
the entire OA and Ay , By , Cy are the response 
average for factors A, B, C, respectively. The 
error term is the difference between the actual 
response on the left and the predicted response 
based on the additive model. 
3 Simulation 
The “edge-emitting” type LD has an 
output beam with elliptical cross sections and 
associated astigmatism. The LD was 
connected to SMF with different spacing 0.4, 
0.6, and 0.8 mm as listed in Table 1. To 
calculate the LD and SMF coupling efficiency 
using the “TrapePro” simulate software, the 
parameters sensitive in terms of affecting the 
coupling must be identified first. The coupling 
alignment is dependent on (1) lens profile; (2) 
lens ellipticity; (3) lens height; (4) distance 
between LD and SMF; (5) PDMS thickness 
and (6) UV-curing epoxy thickness. These 
parameters have a significant influence on the 
performance and variation in the coupling 
mechanism. The specifications of LD setting 
for the TracePro software simulation were a 
980nm wavelength LD with the divergent 
angle 20 °  and waist diameter 1.4μm. The 
incident rays number of the light source was 
106 and the Gaussian beam distribution was 
used. The SMF has the diameters for fiber 
core and cladding were 9μm and 125μm, 
respectively. The control factors that will 
influence the coupling efficiency are shown as

4 Experiment 
The plastic mask was designed first in this 
experiment. From the simulation results, the 
lengths of two ellipse axes pattern on the mask 
were designed as 60 μm and 120 μm. The 
plastic mask layout pattern followed the MT 
type-ferrule drawing shown in Figure 5. 
Silicon wafers were used as the substrate. The 
wafers were cleaned using DI water and 
dehumidified in an oven. A positive 
photoresist (AZ-4620, Clariant Corp., USA) 
was spun coated onto the wafer surface. The 
wafer was then coated with a 20 μm thick 
photoresist layer using a spin coater. The spin 
coating revolution speed was 300 rpm for 10 
seconds and then 600rpm for 25 seconds. To 
prevent the mask from sticking to the 
photoresist surface when exposed, the 
photoresist was soft and hard baked on a hot 
plate and in an oven at 90°C for 5 minutes and 
120°C for 2 minutes, respectively. The wafers 
were then exposed through the mask for 30 
seconds using a UV mask aligner. The aligner 
is equipped with NUV (near ultra-violet) 
wavelength 350-450nm. The lamp power 
ranged from 200-250W. After dipping in the 
developer (THB-D1) for 15 minutes, a pattern 
was obtained. The fabrication process 
involved melting the photoresist patterns on a 
hot plate at a temperature of 160°C for 15 
minutes and it will have a semi-ellipsoid 
shape.  
The semi-ellipsoid shape is dipped into a 
nickel electroplating bath for 40 hours, 
producing the semi-ellipsoid shape mold with 
3 mm thick. Nickel mold on Si substrate was 
separated by etching Si using 40% KOH 
solution at 60°C.  Once Si is dissolved in 
KOH solution for 8 hours, nickel mold is 
ready to replicate semi-elliptical microlens. 
Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is the material 
used for the microlens, baked in an oven at 
100°C for 2 hours. The bonding with the 
optical fiber uses UV-curing epoxy. Before 
bonding, the epoxy is spin coated onto the 
optical fiber and exposed to UV light for 200 
seconds. The final fabrication process 
involves PDMS and optical fiber bonding 
using an optical microscope to align the 
position. UV-curing is then applied to dry the 
epoxy. A schematic diagram of the entire 
semi-ellipsoid microlens array fabrication 
process is shown in Figure 6. The alignment 
uses a MT type ferrule as an optical fiber 
holder. The MT type ferrule is good for optical 
communication interconnections and can also 
be used as fiber holders for mass production. 
With a microlens that has a 
semi-ellipsoid shape on the end of an optical 
fiber, alignment tolerance can be increased 
and the coupling efficiency improved over 
70% that compared with the butt-fiber. The 
benefit of the proposed scheme over the 
traditional fiber lens is mass manufacturing 
and low cost. The proposed novel 
semi-ellipsoid shape fiber endface structure 
can be used for high power lasers and other 
micro-systems allowing the integration of 
huge optical components.
