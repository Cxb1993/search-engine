This paper aims to introduce the on-line neutron monitoring system (NMS) of epithermal neutron 
beam for BNCT at THOR and following tests. The NMS consists of three miniature fission chambers 
(Centronic, FC4A) and one gamma-ray monitor. The data acquisition and display are controlled by an in-house 
graphical user interface program. Both the real-time counting rates and the accumulated counts will be 
displayed simultaneously during irradiation. When the accumulated count reaches a preset value, the NMS will 
send a signal to the reactor operator to shut down the reactor. Examinations have been performed to 
demonstrate the system’s reliability and linearity for desired reactor power range. The neutron counting rates 
were calibrated to the reaction rate of the gold foil measured free-in-air at the beam outlet center. By using the 
on-line NMS, an unstable fluctuation and long-term depression of epithermal neutron beam intensity was 
observed. It is suggested to normalize each performed irradiation by the average reading of the NMS. 
 
Keywords: BNCT, Neutron Monitoring, Epithermal Neutron Beam 
 
 
1. Introduction 
The renovation of epithermal neutron beam for 
BNCT was completed at Tsing Hua Open-pool 
Reactor (THOR) in 2004. [1,2] A series of 
preclinical experiments are under progression for 
determining the beam characteristics. [3,4] An 
on-line neutron monitoring system (NMS) was 
developed and tested since 2002 to monitor the 
beam intensity and provide correction factors for 
other beam characterization measurements. 
THOR is a 2-MW research reactor that 
normally operates from 1 MW to 1.5 MW. Fission 
neutrons in the reactor core are filtered and 
moderated by Al and FLUENTALTM to form the 
epithermal neutron beam. Under a reactor power  
of 1.5 MW, the epithermal neutron intensity 
determined by using double-foil activation method 
at the beam outlet center was 1.4 x 109 cm-2-sec-1; 
the thermal neutron fluence rate was 1.2 x 108 
cm-2-sec-1. [3] 
The major concept of BNCT is the use of 
boron neutron capture reaction 10B(n,α)7Li that will 
produce two high-LET and short range particles, α 
and 7Li, to execute the tumor cell on the spot. In 
order to establish the treatment plan, it is necessary 
to determine the number of 10B(n,α)7Li reactions. To 
determine above quantities under given 10B 
concentration, one must determine the energy and 
time dependent neutron fluence rate first. The 
energy dependent neutron fluence rate or the 
neutron spectrum can be determined by using 
activation foils. As to the time dependent part, it is 
necessary to actively monitor the neutron fluence 
rate during an irradiation to provide the differential 
information of the beam intensity. As a result, an 
on-line NMS was developed to meet the 
requirement by using three miniature fission 
chambers. In addition to provide the real-time 
neutron fluence rate, it will notify the reactor 
operator to shut down the reactor when a preset 
count is reached. The NMS was also used to be the 
reference standard for all other experiments. 
By monitoring the time dependent beam 
intensity for 30 hours under the same nominal 
reactor power, a long-term depression exceeding 
10% was observed. A study of the effect of different 
control rod positions on the epithermal neutron 
beam intensity was also performed. 
 
2. On-line Neutron Monitoring System 
2.1. Hardware and installation 
Fission chamber was chosen to be the neutron 
detector due to its excellent neutron/gamma 
discrimination that the fission energy is tens times 
of gamma rays. Only a single channel analyzer 
(SCA) is needed to separate the gamma contribution 
3
measured by using an N-type high purity 
germanium (HPGe) detector. The calibration is also 
going to be performed after a reinstallation or 
replacement of the fission chamber. 
 
3.2. Linearity Calibration 
An ideal NMS should have its neutron 
counting rate measured proportional to the real 
neutron fluence rate or reactor power with a 
constant ratio. All counting systems with pulse 
mode detectors bear the dead time effect. For a 
system operated at a very high counting rate region, 
the counts detected is no longer valid for estimating 
the real neutron fluence rate without any dead time 
correction. Hence it is important to verify the linear 
range of the on-line NMS. 
The linearity calibration of the on-line NMS 
was performed by irradiating simultaneously 
another fission chamber with significantly low 
counting rate, which was identical to the regular one 
but encapsulated with boron carbide. It is 
reasonable to assume the fission chamber with low 
counting rate free from dead time losses. Fig.3 
shows the result of the linearity calibration. 
According to the result, it is acceptable to operate 
the NMS in a range not larger than 16,000 cps and 
have the neutron counting rate around 8,000 cps for 
reactor power operated at 1 MW. Over the linear 
region, the counting rate curve began to bend down 
ware as a result of dead time losses. 
 
4. Results and Discussion 
A series of tests for the on-line NMS have been 
performed to demonstrate the reliability of the 
system since 2002. In the past four years, the NMS 
has accumulated considerable history data that give 
valuable indications of the THOR operation. 
 
4.1. Beam Monitoring 
The on-line NMS at THOR can indicate the 
intensity of epithermal neutron beam correctly even 
by using only one channel when the other two are 
failed or blind. This was examined by set three 
fission chambers in different conditions. Channel-A, 
which was partially wrapped with Cd, responded 
dominantly to thermal neutrons and was installed in 
the down side tunnel; Channel-B was located in the 
left side tunnel and was fully covered by Cd. It was 
insensitive to thermal neutrons and responded only 
to epithermal neutrons. Channel-C was set 
free-in-air in the epithermal neutron beam and was 
encapsulated with boron carbine to reduce the 
counting rate. Figure 4 shows the counting rate 
histories of the three fission chambers. From the 
consistency of the counting rates of three channels, 
one could conclude: first, there was no significant 
difference between different sites, in other words, 
the ratio of one site to another was constant; second, 
the ratio of thermal neutron fluence rate to 
epithermal one was constant too; third, the neutron 
counting rate measured in the tunnel was straight 
proportional to the epithermal neutron fluence rate. 
The movement of the rotational shutter was 
tested to confirm if any difference would be 
observed, and it was found that the on-line NMS 
was unconscious of the rotational shutter. Also, a 
fully filled 35 x 35 x 31 cm water phantom was 
placed in the epithermal neutron beam to induce 
back scattering neutrons, and no additional counts 
were detected by the NMS. 
 
4.2. Beam Stability 
The on-line NMS has been used to study the 
stability of the epithermal neutron beam under 
automatic control mode of THOR at 1 MW. 
Unstable beam fluctuations were observed from Fig. 
5 because of the aging of signal processing elements 
of the THOR monitoring system. Electronic and 
electromagnetic noises would affect the power 
judgment of the control system occasionally. The 
noise would form spurious signals, and an extra

Activation

Neutron fluence rates of the BNCT epithermal neutron beam at THOR were measured by using double-foil 
activation method free-in-air and in a water phantom. Foil sets consisting of gold, copper and manganese were 
used for measurements. Copper was used as an extra detector for quality check. Monte Carlo calculations using 
the MCNP4C code were conducted to support and compare with the measurement results. It was found that the 
calculation of reaction rates of foils free-in-air based on a neutron source with a coarse group energy structure 
is inadequate. The meetness of the assumptions on the neutron energy distribution made in the double-foil 
formulation for the determination of neutron fluence rates must be estimated in order to compare with the 
calculation.

1. Introduction 
After entering tissue, epithermal neutrons are 
moderated in tissue resulting in a peak in thermal 
neutron fluence rate at depths of approximately 2 to 
3 cm. By using an epithermal neutron beam the 
thermal neutron profile can be shifted toward depths 
of tissue and thereby the therapeutic depth can be 
extended. Therefore, epithermal neutron beams 
were installed in essentially all BNCT facilities 
around the world since 1990’s. The reconstruction 
of the BNCT epithermal neutron beam at Tsing Hua 
Open-pool Reactor (THOR) was completed in the 
third quarter 2004. Prior to the commissioning of 
the BNCT beam at THOR, beam characteristics, 
among others, the neutron fluence rate, the neutron 
spectrum, and the neutron and gamma-ray dose 
rates need to be determined at first. The BNCT 
epithermal neutron beam at THOR was designed by 
using the MCNP4C code associated with the 
ENDF/B-VI cross section library to have an 
epithermal neutron fluence rate of 1.7 x 109 cm-2s-1 
and a thermal neutron fluence rate of 0.2 x 109 
cm-2s-1 at the beam outlet for 1 MW reactor power. 
[1] This paper aimed to measure the neutron fluence 
rates of the BNCT beam at THOR using foil 
activation. Foil sets consisting of Au, Cu and Mn 
were used to measure thermal and epithermal 
neutron fluence rates free-in-air and in a water 
phantom with dimensions of 35 x 35 x 31 cm placed 
along the beam axis at the locations of 16 cm from 
the beam outlet. The measured reaction rates of foils 
and neutron fluence rates were compared with 
design calculations. The discrepancies between 
measurement and calculation were discussed and 
some further investigations were suggested. 
 
2. Material and Methods 
Neutron fluence rates free-in-air and in a water 
phantom with dimensions of 35 x 35 x 31 cm and 
PMMA wall thickness of 0.8 cm were measured by 
using double-foil method. Foil sets consisting of 
gold followed by copper and manganese purchased 
from NRG Petten, The Netherlands were adopted 
for the measurements. The composition and 
dimensions of the foil set are listed in Table 1. 
Copper was used as an extra foil and the ratio of 
reaction rates per atom for manganese and copper

calculations were also listed in Table 2. From our 
Monte Carlo calculations it shows that the reaction 
rate of gold R(Au) comes essentially from 
epithermal neutrons. The contribution of thermal 
neutrons is only a few percent. However, thermal 
neutrons contribute roughly 1/3 to the reaction rates 
of copper and manganese R(Cu) and R(Mn). In 
Table 2, it is noted that the scaling factor between 
calculation and measurement is much higher for 
R(Au) than those for R(Cu) and R(Mn). The 
thermal neutron component in the disk source being 
underestimated or the contribution of reaction rates 
due to thermal neutrons coming from room 
scattering being not modeled in the calculation may 
account for this large difference in scaling factors. 
However, from a preliminary test calculation, we 
highly suspect that the coarse group spectrum of the 
disk source may be inadequate in the calculation of 
foil reaction rates, where the contribution comes 
directly from source neutrons. With the coarse 
group spectrum the reaction rate of gold R(Au), 
which comes dominantly from neutron absorption 
in the huge sharp resonance peak around 4 eV, will 
be significantly overestimated. On the other hand, 
the flat energy distribution of thermal neutrons will 
slightly underestimate the reaction rates of copper 
R(Cu) and manganese R(Mn). This fact is also 
expressed by the comparison of RAu/RMn, which is 
an indicator of thermalization of the neutron 
spectrum. The ratio of RAu/RMn for a well 
thermalized neutron spectrum is 7.42. [2] Taking 
this suspicion into account, the scaling factor of 
reaction rates between calculation and measurement 
might fall in the range 2.5~3.0. This large scaling 
factor might be attributed to the incorrectness in the 
reactor power calibration, spatial distribution of the 
reactor power, control blade positions, etc. The ratio 
of RMn/RCu (around 3.0), which is insensitive to the 
neutron spectrum, agreed very well between 
measurement and calculation and also with many 
measurements in other facilities. [2] The measured 
thermal and epithermal neutron fluence rates as 
shown in the last two columns of Table 2 might bear 
larger error because that the experimental 
assumptions of the Maxwellian and 1/E energy 
distributions of neutrons were clearly deviated for 
measurement positions free-in-air. This inference is 
based on our calculation experiment with infinite 
dilute foils. Foil sets measurements were also 
carried out in the water phantom placed at the 
location of 16 cm from the beam outlet. Results of 
measurement and calculation are listed in Table 3. 
The depth of 0 cm is the beginning of water that is 
behind the 0.8-cm PMMA wall. From the reaction 
rate comparison for the three foils between 
measurement and calculation it is noted that the 
scaling factor remained roughly a constant value 
around 2.8 after the depth of 1.8 cm. However, 
before the depth of 1.8 cm the scaling factor is 
much higher for R(Au) than those for R(Cu) and 
R(Mn) that is about the same situation as free-in-air. 
This may be because that in this region near the 
edge of the water phantom a significant part of 
reaction rates was caused directly from source 
neutrons. The thermalization indicator RAu/RMn in 
Table 3 indicates that the neutron spectrum in the 
water phantom was obviously much more 
thermalized than free-in-air and the thermalization 
process proceeded continuously with the water 
depth. The ratio of RMn/RCu remained around 2.80 
for all measurement depths and deviated from the 
value free-in-air (2.92), where the fluence rate 
consists essentially of epithermal neutrons, only by 
less than 5%. Note that the scaling factors (c/m) of 
thermal and epithermal fluence rates after the depth 
of 1.8 cm  were in good consistence with those of 
reaction rates. It may imply that the thermal and 
epithermal neutron fluence rates measured in the 
water phantom could be adequate indicators for 
characterizing the beam intensity.

where u and t denote detectors with low neutron 
sensitivity Mg(Ar) and with approximately equal 
sensitivity to gamma rays and neutrons TE(TE), 
respectively. Dγ and Dn are the absorbed gamma-ray 
and neutron doses in the mixed field. Mu and Mt are 
the measured readings corrected for ambient and 
electrical conditions. Nu,c and Nt,c  are calibration 
factors for absorbed doses to brain tissue in the 60Co 
gamma-ray beam. h and k are the relative responses 
of gamma rays and neutrons, respectively in the 
mixed beam to the responses in the 60Co calibration. 
The air kerma calibration (free-in-air) of 
ionization chamber was performed using the 60Co 
source in the National Radiation Standard 
Laboratory, INER. The calibration in air kerma was 
then converted to the absorbed dose to brain tissue 
using the ratio of the mass energy absorption 
coefficients. The relative gamma-ray sensitivity for 
both chambers hu and ht were taken as 1 and the 
relative neutron sensitivity for M2 chamber was 
taken as 0. The relative neutron sensitivity kt as a 
function of neutron energy calculated by Jansen et 
al. [5] as shown in Fig. 1. was adopted. Since kt is 
strong function of neutron energy, its value will be 
position dependent. The value of kt was estimated in 
this work by weighting the energy dependent kt with 
the neutron kerma distribution of the measurement 
position. Neutron spectra free-in-air and in the 
water phantom were calculated by using MCNP4C 
associated with the ENDF/B-VI cross section 
library based on a uniform disk source with 
47-group energy and 8-angular interval distribution 
at the beam outlet with an aperture of 14-cm 
diameter, which was established during the 
development of the treatment planning system for 
BNCT at THOR. [6] The total track length density 
tally was applied for the neutron spectrum 
estimation. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
The paired ionization chambers were calibrated 
free-in-air for air kerma to be 3.98 x 107 Gy/C for 
M2 chamber and 5.23 x 107 Gy/C for T2 chamber 
and then converted to the absorbed dose to brain 
tissue using the ratio of mass energy absorption 
coefficients (1.102). [7] 
Figure 2 shows axial profiles free-in-air of 
neutron fluence rate, neutron kerma rate and kt from 
calculations. From Fig. 2 it is noted that although 
roughly 90% of neutron fluence rate comes from 
epithermal neutrons, the neutron kerma rate is 
contributed mainly by fast neutrons so that the 
kerma weighted kt changes around 0.82. The 
thermal neutron fluence rate decreases with the 
depth much rapidly and thermal neutron contribute 
only a tiny share to the neutron kerma rate. 
Figure 3 shows the depth profiles of neutron 
fluence rate, neutron kerma rate and kt in the water 
phantom placed at immediate contact with the beam 
outlet from calculations. It is noted from Fig. 3 that 
the neutron kerma rate as well as fluence rate comes 
essentially from thermal and epithermal neutrons 
with thermal neutrons being the major contributor.

4. Conclusions 
Paired ionization chambers were used in this 
work to measure the neutron and gamma-ray dose 
rates of the BNCT epithermal neutron beam at 
THOR along the beam axis free-in-air and in the 
water phantom. The position dependent and kerma 
rate weighted neutron sensitivities of the TE(TE) 
chamber were adopted in the measurements. Monte 
Carlo calculations of the neutron fluence rates and 
neutron kerma rates using the MCNP4C code were 
used to support the measurements and compare with 
the measured results. It was found that free-in-air 
neutron dose rates , which mainly come from fast 
neutrons, were a factor of around 3.7 higher than 
gamma-ray dose rates. However, in the water 
phantom gamma-ray dose rates were more than a 
factor of 10 much higher than neutron dose rates of 
which thermal neutrons were the main contributor. 
Negative values of neutron dose rates appeared for 
the measurements in the water phantom leads to our 
great suspicion that the neutron sensitivity of the 
Mg(Ar) chamber adopted in this work (ku = 0) 
might be incorrect. The reasons that near the edge 
of the beam aperture the neutron dose rates 
free-in-air were higher for measurement than 
calculation are not clear and further investigations 
are needed.

leading to a renovation of the epithermal neutron
beam at THOR.
There are two facts that limit the design and
reconstruction of the new epithermal neutron beam.
First, the concrete cutting area is limited due to
structure concern and engineering constraint.
Secondly, the radiation level is very high inside the
reconstruction area due to surrounding radioactive
materials from long term irradiation by the reactor
core. Figure 2 shows the final design of the new
epithermal neutron beam. It was a compromise
owing to the engineering constraint and radiation
level [4]. Besides moderator/filter design, the other
reconstruction processes and experiences will be
described below.
Figure 2: Diagram of the new epithermal neutron
beam at THOR (2004)
2.1 Radiation level monitoring
For reconstruction of the epithermal neutron test
beam as a new one, THOR was shutdown in
January 2003 for decay of the surrounding
radioactive materials. In order to estimate the
probable accumulated dose for the workers involved
in this reconstruction project, the radiation level was
monitored at the end part of the thermal column.
After 4 months decay, the measured radiation level
was 0.4 mSv/h which was only 25% of the original
radiation level while the reactor just shutdown.
Based on this data, the predicted radiation level at
the front of the thermal column should be 0.04 Sv/h
according to the magnitude of the neutron flux
distribution in the thermal column. Thus, the
probable accumulated dose for a person staying
inside the reconstruction area for 100 hours is as
high as 1 Sv based on the average radiation level in
this area.
Since the predicted accumulated dose for the
workers involved in this reconstruction project is
too high to meet the related regulations in Taiwan,
particular shielding design and reconstruction
processes should be provided to lower the radiation
level and the probable accumulated dose for the
workers. A temporary shielding door with 5 cm Pb
was installed to protect workers from radiation from
the thermal column and a drawbar was first installed
on the rear end of each graphite string for remote
withdrawal. Assembly of the filter/moderator
components was completed in advance on a trolley
outside the thermal column. These actions can
effectively reduce the operation time and prevent
workers from having to approach high radiation
areas. Therefore, the highest accumulated dose for a
person involved in this project is less than 2 mSv
after such arrangements.
2.2 Structure analysis and Concrete cutting
In order to provide sufficient space for
irradiation room, the original heavy concrete of
THOR need to be cut off to reserve a minimum
room size of 380 cm wide, 240 cm height, and 390
cm depth. Structure analysis based on SAP-2000
code was performed to assure that THOR structure
after cutting is safe from the earthquake in Taiwan.
Figure 3: SAP-2000 structure analysis model and
results
Figure 3 shows the structure analysis model and
results by assuming 0.33g ground acceleration
derived from the earthquake. The results show the
stresses were focused on the opening edges, but the
values were still under the safety limitation.

room is shown as Figure 7. The room size is 380 cm
in width, 240 cm in height, and 390 cm in depth.
The width for the passage is 180 cm.
The shielding for the irradiation room was
designed based on MCNP simulation using a
pre-calculated source plane at the beam exit. The
thickness of the concrete (density =3 g/cm3) of the
walls and ceiling of the irradiation room were
designed to be 100 cm. Furthermore, Li2CO3-PE of
2 cm thick was used for lining the walls and ceiling
inside the irradiation room. It was used to capture
neutrons and to lower the background gamma dose
inside.
The thickness for the entrance door is 60 cm. It
was composed of 56 cm thick concrete and 2 cm
thick Li2CO3-PE within an iron case of 1 cm thick
on each side. This construction was completed in
August 2004. After construction of the irradiation
room, THOR was started up to measure the
radiation level outside the irradiation room. Figure 7
also shows the measurement data. It can be found
from the results that the radiation level around the
irradiation room is smaller than 10 μSv/h.
Figure 7: Radiation level around irradiation room
3. Summary
The total duration for reconstruction of the
epithermal neutron beam at THOR was 20 months.
The first eight months were spent for cooling the
radioactive materials, monitoring the radiation level,
and special shielding design. Next four months were
spent for concrete cutting and structure reinforcing.
Another four months at the beginning of 2004 were
spent for beam assembling. The final four months
were spent for the shielding design and construction
of the irradiation room.
The space of THOR was also rearranged to
isolate the BNCT area from the reactor hall. The air
condition for BNCT area such can be independent
to the ventilation system of the reactor to assure the
air in the BNCT area is fresh. On-going tasks for
BNCT project at THOR include beam parameters
measurement, in vitro/ in vivo study, and calibration
of the treatment planning system, with the hope that
the team can be ready for clinical trials in 2-3 years.

Abstract 
 
The readout parameters of 7LiF:Mg,Cu,P thermoluminescence dosimeters were 
investigated in detail. The residual signal and the reproducibility of the 7LiF:Mg,Cu,P 
were the major concern. An optimum readout scheme has been established. The 
7LiF:Mg,Cu,P chips were used to measure the gamma-ray doses at the exit of the 
boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) beam in the Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor. 
The results were compared with those measured using an ionization chamber with 
magnesium wall and argon flow gas.

2. Methods and Materials 
 
 TLD-700H TL chips 4.5 mm in diameter and 0.6 mm thick from Thermo 
(www.thermo.com) and TLD 7000 TL chips 4.5 mm in diameter and 0.8 mm thick 
from Rexon (www.rexon.com) were used. The TL chips were encapsulated in a 
cylindrical Teflon capsule with a wall thickness of 4 mm (each capsule can 
accommodate 3 chips) and irradiated in a 3-Ci 137Cs gamma-ray calibration facility 
for a test dose of around 1 mGy. The Rexon UL-320 TLD reader was used for TL 
readouts. N2 flow is always used while running readout cycles. A Rexon 
programmable oven with circulation fan was used for TL chip annealing. The readout 
scheme comprises a heating profile starting from heating up to 50 ℃ at 6th s and then 
a linear increase in temperature from 50 to 240 ℃ at a rate of 10 K s-1 followed by a 
constant temperature plateau to 10 s and the TL signal is read out from 10th to 35th s 
(the end of the heating profile). For oven annealing TL chips are put in the 7 x 7 dip 
array drilled on a stainless steel annealing tray 8 mm thick. When the oven 
temperature keeping at 240 ℃ the annealing tray with TL chips is inserted into the 
oven for 10 min and then taken out and put on an aluminum quench block at room 
temperature immediately. 
 
3. Results and Discussions 
 
3.1 Investigation of readout parameters 
 The residual signal (expressed as a percentage of the first readout) of the 
27
shows the residual signal as a function of total readout scheme time. Note that for the 
180-s total readout scheme time (155-s constant temperature plateau) the residual 
signal appeared to be around 0.1%. The standard deviations for 10 readout cycles 
using 180-s readout scheme were found to be 0.69% for TLD-7000 and 0.84% for 
TLD-700H. In order to further improve the reproducibility of the TL response the 
features of the glow curve were examined. It was found that the main peak of the 
glow curve (P3 in Fig. 2) is the most stable one and peaks P1 and P2 fade more 
quickly with half-lifes of 48.4 and 608.9 hours, respectively. A new readout scheme 
was designed. Starting from 50 ℃ at 6th s a preheat step is added in the heating profile 
which comprises a linear increase of temperature from 50 ℃ to 150 ℃ at a rate of 20 
K s-1 followed by a constant temperature plateau to 7 s. The following main heating 
from 150 ℃ at 18th s to 240 ℃ at 27th s at a rate of 10 K s-1 is followed by a constant 
temperature plateau to 153 s and this, in turn, give also a total readout scheme time of 
180 s. The TL signal is read out from 18th to 35th s. Figure 4 shows the heating 
profiles with and without preheat step. Applying the readout scheme with preheat step 
the readout TL signal precludes that from the easier fading P1 peak. The standard 
deviation of TLD-7000 for 10 readout cycles using the optimum readout scheme with 
preheat was found to be 0.5%. 
 
3.3 Measurement of gamma-ray doses in BNCT beam 
 Three pieces of TLD-7000 chips were loaded in the Teflon capsule and irradiated 
in the BNCT beam of the THOR at positions along the beam axis with distances of 20 
and 40 cm from the beam exit for measurements of gamma-ray doses. An Exradin 
type 2 Mg(Ar) ionization chamber with a volume of 0.53 cm3 together with the TLDs 
was irradiated simultaneously for comparison. The irradiation times were 6 and 12 
29
treated as individual detectors and calibrated separately. The major concerns were the 
residual signal and reproducibility. An optimum readout scheme featured with an 
extended constant temperature plateau and a preheat step was adopted, by which the 
standard deviation of TLD-7000 for 10 readout cycles was found to be 0.5%. The 
TLD-7000 chips were then used together with a 0.53-cm3 Mg(Ar) ionization chamber 
to measure the gamma-ray doses free-in-air in the BNCT beam of the THOR. It was 
found that the measured gamma-ray doses agreed very well between two detectors 
(within~3.5%). The neutron contributions for both detectors were evaluated to be 
insignificant (~2%). Following measurements in a water phantom, where it may incur 
more neutron contributions, will be carried out in the near future.

1. Introduction 
Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) utilizes the nuclear reaction 10B(n,α)7Li 
occurred in the tumor, which emits two short range, high LET, heavy charged 
particles 4He and 7Li to destroy the tumor cell. Hence, BNCT highly depends on two 
essential terms: 1) the concentration of boron compound in the tumor, and 2) the 
number of thermal neutrons delivered to the tumor through moderating the incident 
epithermal neutrons by tissue material. The spatial distribution of the neutron source 
over the exit surface of an epithermal neutron beam is one of the necessary 
information to estimate the aforesaid second term. Consequently, it is always an 
enthusiastic topic to obtain the neutron profile. In the past, neutron profiles were 
normally measured by the activation method using small activation foils. The number 
of activation foils needed to be irradiated in the beam is proportional to the required 
spatial resolution. The better the resolution is required, the more the time and effort 
have to be paid. In order to obtain a high-resolution neutron profile, however, with a 
reasonable measuring time, the authors propose an innovative method to measure the 
two-dimensional (2D) neutron beam profile using the indirect neutron radiography. 
The indirect neutron radiography using an aluminum plate as the converter and an 
image plate as the activity detector was applied to measure the 2D beam profile of the 
BNCT epithermal neutron beam at the Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor (THOR). The 
45
two-dimensional spatial distribution of neutron flux. The activity of the irradiated 
target is proportional to the product of the target cross section and the neutron flux. 
Hence, the activity distribution over the target is the relative distribution of the 
concerned neutron flux when the neutron spectrum is constant. As a result, the 
developed image can be processed into the neutron flux map after proper translation. 
2.3. Activation Converter 
In regard to the availability and cost, an 1-mm thick aluminium plate (>95 wt% 
of Al) was chosen to function as an activation converter to be irradiated in the beam 
for the neutron flux mapping. The aluminium plate was cut into a 20 cm x 40 cm 
rectangle. The produced nuclides have been analyzed by a well-calibrated High Purity 
Germanium (HPGe) detector right after a 15-min irradiation. The dominant 
radioisotope in the aluminium plate is 28Al formed from 27Al(n,γ)28Al reaction which 
is sensitive to thermal neutrons. The analyzed result is shown in Fig. 1.  
2.4. Imaging Plate 
Imaging plate (IP) system was first introduced by Fuji Film Co. in 1983 as an 
integrating, reusable, radiation sensitive area detector2. The IP applied in this work is 
type BAS-IIIs or the so-called white IP made by Fuji, whose phosphor material is 
BaFBr:Eu2+, and the IP reader is Fuji FLA-3000, whose pixel size is 50 µm. The 
dimensions of the BAS-IIIs IP are 20 cm wide and 40 cm long. It was chosen as the 
47
where kc is a conversion factor (PSL/Bq-sec); α(t) is the time dependent activity of 
radiation source (Bq); and Texp is the exposure time (sec). 
2.5. Experiment Configuration 
The aluminum plate was placed across the beam at the beam exit and aligned by a 
laser system. After the irradiation, the activated plate was removed from the beam and 
placed into an IP cassette for exposure. Inside the cassette, the aluminum plate was 
attached against the surface of IP. Such an arrangement increases the responses of IP 
to the radioactivity and also improves the quality of image because that the IP 
response is contributed dominantly from weak-penetrating beta particles compared to 
the decay gamma rays emitted from the 28Al beta decay. 
In order to minimize the influence caused by fading phenomenon, all the 
experiments are performed in a temperature-controlled dark room (16 ± 1°C). After 
the exposure, the IP was moved into the IP reader for development. The readout is in 
the form of digitalized data registered inside the controlling computer’s memory. For 
decreasing the statistical fluctuation of the obtained result, the central 14 cm by 14 cm 
square of the readout image was processed into a 25 by 25 matrix. Each element size 
is 5.6 mm by 5.6 mm, which still provides a satisfactory spatial resolution. All the 
image processing was done by using Fujifilm Image Gauge software. 
In order to obtain more information of the beam characteristics, the beam

process was 10 min.  
It is clear that kc of Eq. 2 is confirmed to be constant. Hence the PSL value is 
directly proportional to the activity of the radiation source. In other words, the 
developed image of the exposed IP is the relative intensity map of the neutron flux 
across the aluminum plate. 
3.2. 2-D Neutron Flux Mapping using Indirect Neutron Radiography 
The aluminum plate was irradiated for 15 min with a reactor power of 1.2 MW to 
perform the indirect neutron radiography for the neutron flux mapping. A 15-min 
irradiation of aluminum plate will accumulate 99% saturated activity of 28Al whose 
half-life is 2.2 min. Any longer irradiation will only increase the activities of 
impurities in the plate. The activated aluminum plate was then exposed to the IP for 
30 min. The developed raw image is shown in Fig. 3. 
The neutron flux distribution is quite flat within 8-cm diameter at the beam center, 
where the difference is within ±2.5% according to the processed image (Fig. 4). The 
integrated value of each concerned element in the matrix was larger than 10,000 PSL. 
3.3. Calculated and Measured Horizontal Profile 
Figure 5 shows the 28Al activity profiles along the horizontal axis of the beam 
aperture, obtained from the IP measurement and MCNP calculations with 
cosine-shape, cosine-square-shape, designed-source, and adjusted designed-source 
51
The developed image of IP may not equal to the intensity distribution of the 
virtual neutron source in MCNP calculations due to the influence of angular 
distribution. When the concerned neutron source is close to isotropic, the neutron flux 
distribution will decrease much more rapidly near the beam edge than the forward 
sources do. From the neutron flux mapping result, it is concluded that the angular 
distribution of thermal neutron component of the THOR epithermal neutron beam is 
close to isotropic; as to the epithermal neutron component, it is much more forward.
