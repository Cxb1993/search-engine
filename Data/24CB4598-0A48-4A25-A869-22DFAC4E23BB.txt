Adopting the Von Karman large deflection assumptions, 
the kinematic relation can be determined as 
         z0                       (2)                                               
where  0 ,   ,    are the strain, plate curvature 
and large deflection strain in the mid-plane, respectively.   
  The SMA embedded composite plates are made of 
graphite/epoxy lamina and SMA composite lamina. The 
graphite/epoxy plies are stacked symmetrically on the 
top and bottom of the Nitinol/epoxy ply to make the 
SMA reinforced laminate. Each graphite/epoxy layer has 
arbitrary fiber orientation (θ). The SMA fibers in the 
middle layer are aligned parallel to the longitudinal di-
rection but distributed unevenly in the transverse direc-
tion. Hence, the SMA fiber volume fraction, SMAfV , is a 
function of nondimensional coordinate =2y/b having its 
origin at the plate center. With this variable SMA fiber 
spacing, the elastic moduli E1, E2, 12 and G12 for the 
Nitinol/epoxy ply are also functions of . In this study, 
the formulas used for the calculation of these effective 
engineering constants are based on the rule of mixture 
[15, 16].

  For a composite laminated plate with N layers, the 
stress-strain relation of kth layer of the plate can be ex-
pressed as

where ijQ  are the transformed reduced stiffness.

denotes the temperature-dependent SMA recovery stress 
in the SMA fiber direction. Now the stress-strain relation 
becomes location-dependent and temperature-dependent. 
The force and moment resultants of the composite lami-

The incremental recovery stress resultant  rN  
depends on the temperature T, prestrain r  and SMA 
fiber volume fraction SMAfV . 
For accuracy and simplicity, the three displacement 
functions for the in-plane and out-of-plane deformation 
are assumed to have the same form [4, 5, 13, 14]. By 
following the procedure described in these references, 
the strain energy, the work done by the in-plane forces 
and the kinematic energy can be obtained.

the fundamental natural mode will shift back from 
mode (2,1) to mode (1,1) right after the buckle pat-
tern change. 
(3) The buckling mode of the plates with graphite fiber 
orientated between 51o and 63o is always mode 
<2,1>. The fundamental natural mode will shift 
from mode (1,1) to mode (2,1) before the buckling. 
However, the fundamental natural mode will shift 
back from mode (2,1) to mode (1,1) right after the 
buckling. 
(4) The buckle pattern change also occurs for the plates 
with graphite fiber orientated between 64o and 73o. 
The plate is first buckled into the <2,1> mode. The 
fundamental natural mode will shift from mode (1,1) 
to mode (2,1) before the buckling. However, the 
fundamental natural mode will shift back from 
mode (2,1) to mode (1,1) right after the buckling. 
When the loading is larger than the critical value, 
the buckling shape of the plate is shifted from mode 
<2,1> to mode <3,1>. The fundamental natural 
mode will shift from mode (1,1) to mode (2,1) right 
after the buckle pattern change. 
(5) The buckling mode of the plates with graphite fiber 
orientated between 74o and 90o is always mode 
<3,1>. The fundamental natural mode will shift 
from mode (1,1) to mode (2,1) first and further shift 
to mode (1,1) before the buckling. However, the 
fundamental natural mode will shift back to mode 
(2,1) again right after the buckling. 
In the following section, cases (3) and (4) are studied 
in detail. Figure 3 shows the dynamic behavior of 
[60/-60/0SMA/-60/60] laminates. Before the critical buck-
ling load, the plate remains flat. As the in-plane force 
reaches the critical buckling load, the plate will buckle 
into mode <2,1> because the equilibrium state of the flat 
plate becomes unstable. This is also evident from the 
eigenvalue ( ) vs. ocrP/P 0   plot in the figure, as the 
lowest eigenvalue of the system for the unbuckled plate 
becomes negative, while for the <2,1> mode it is posi-
tive. It is seen that the fundamental natural mode will 
shift from mode (1,1) to mode (2,1) before buckling into 
mode <2,1>. In addition, the fundamental natural mode 
will shift back to mode (1,1) after the buckling.  
Figure 4 shows the dynamic behavior of 
[65/-65/0SMA/-65/65] laminates. Before the critical buck-
ling load, the plate remains flat. As the in-plane force 
reaches the critical buckling load, the plate will buckle 
into mode <2,1> because the equilibrium state of the flat 
plate becomes unstable. This can also be seen in the ei-
genvalue ( ) vs. ocrP/P 0   plot in the figure, in 
which the lowest eigenvalue of the system for the un-
buckled plate becomes negative and that for the <2,1> 
mode is positive. If the in-plane force is further in-
creased, the plate will remain in mode <2,1> until the 
in-plane force is increased to a critical point. At this 
point, the buckling mode <2,1> becomes unstable and a 
change in the buckle pattern occurs. The buckling mode 
of the plate is suddenly shifted from mode <2,1> to 
mode <3,1>. It is also seen that the fundamental natural 
mode will shift from mode (1,1) to mode (2,1) before 
buckling into mode <2,1>. In addition, the fundamental 
natural mode will shift to mode (1,1)* after the buckling. 
After the buckle pattern change from mode <2,1> to 
mode <3,1>, the fundamental natural mode will shift 
back to mode (2,1). The asterisk is added to distinguish 
between the natural mode after the buckling and the 
mode before the buckling. 
It is seen that the fundamental natural mode of 
[θ/-θ/0SMA/-θ/θ] laminates may change from one mode to 
another when the in-plane force is increased. As the 
in-plane force is gradually increased, the plate will 
buckle into mode <m,1> at the critical value. Because 
this buckle or buckle pattern change, the frequency of a 
natural mode with a similar mode shape will drop to 
zero, i.e., the frequency of natural mode (m,1) drops to 
zero. This is the reason why the fundamental natural 
mode shifts from other modes to mode (m,1) before the 
buckling or the buckle pattern change. However, the 
fundamental natural mode will shift to mode (m-1,1) 
right after the buckling and buckle pattern change.  
The only exception is the (1,1)* mode with three 
half-waves in the x  direction. Figure 4 may be used to 
explain this special case. The fundamental natural mode 
should shift back to mode (1,1) after the plate buckles 
into mode <2,1>. However, the fundamental natural 
mode should shift to mode (3,1) before the plate is 
shifted to mode <3,1>. Therefore, the fundamental natu-
ral mode becomes mode (1,1)* which originally is mode 
(1,1), but it has three half-waves in the x  direction.  
Conclusions 
(1) The increase of SMA fiber volume fraction and pre-
strain may generate more recovery stress, and in-
crease the stiffness of SMA reinforced composite 
laminate. Therefore, the postbuckling deflections of 
the plate will be decreased considerably and the 
natural frequencies of the plate may be modified 
significantly.  
(2) The natural frequencies may be more efficiently 
modified by increasing the SMA fiber volume frac-
tion to reinforce the center of the plate. 
(3) The buckling mode and the fundamental natural 
mode are dependent on the graphite fiber orientation 
of the SMA reinforced angle-ply laminates.
