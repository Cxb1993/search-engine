length. For the phonon transport in nanocomposites 
which is dominated by interface scattering, the 
major contribution to the thermal conductivity 
reduction comes from the interface scattering rather 
than the modification to the phonon dispersion. Past 
studies on phonon transport in nanocomposites use 
gray media approximation which accounts for bulk 
phonon dispersion relation. In terms of phonon 
intensity I, the 3D phonon BTE under the relaxation 
time approximation can be written as 
 
where t is time, r = (x, y, z) the position vector, 
and Ω=(μ,η,ζ). IE= CvT/4π  is the quilibrium 
phonon intensity. In the relaxation time 
approximation, the intrinsic scattering processes, 
including impurity scattering, phonon-phonon 
scattering and phonon-electron scattering, are 
lumped through the average phonon MFP. 
Interface scattering plays an important role on 
phonon transport in nanostructures. When a phonon 
encounters an interface which is formed by two 
different materials, the phonon may experience 
specular or diffuse scattering. In this study, the 
interface scattering is assumed to be diffusive. The 
interface conditions under diffuse mismatch model 
can be expressed respectively as 
 
where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent different 
media which form an interface with normal vector n 
toward medium 2. R12 is the phonon reflectivity 
across the interface from medium 1 to medium 2 
and T21 is the phonon transmissivity across the 
interface from medium 2 to medium 1. A detailed 
balance consideration leads to the definition of 
transmissivity T12 = U2v2/(U1v1 + U2v2), here U is 
the phonon energy density. The relation for 
transmissivity and reflectivity is T12 + R12 = 1. 
To model the periodic structures, the unit cells for 
different composites, as shown in Fig. 1, are applied 
to analyze the phonon transport. The characteristic 
size LC denotes the width of films, square wires or 
cubic particles. For equal atomic composition of the 
two species, the interface densities, defined as the 
interfacial area per unit volume, of 1D superlattice, 
2D wire composite, and 3D particle composite are 
1/LC, 2/LC, and 3/LC, respectively. The periodic 
boundary condition is imposed at the boundary 
location of the unit cell. At the boundaries in heat 
flow direction, a constant temperature difference is 
applied to study the heat transfer. In the coordinate 
which is vertical to the heat flow direction, the 
implementation of periodic boundary condition is 
simply to set the phonon intensity at the boundary 
location as that at periodic location. In the heat flow 
direction, the implementation of periodic boundary 
condition has to consider the existence of a 
temperature difference as 
 
where rB and rP represent the boundary and periodic 
locations. The equilibrium intensity satisfies 
IE(rB)-IE(rP) = CvΔT/4π, here ΔT is the temperature 
difference. The heat flux is defined as 
 
A deterministic 3D phonon BTE solver, which 
contains the discrete ordinate method and the step 
scheme, is employed. In the discrete ordinate 
method, the solid angle is divided into discrete 
directions by Gauss-Legendre quadratures to 
achieve high-order integration accuracy. With the 
phonon direction discretized, the phonon BTE can 
be transferred into a set of advection equations with 
source terms in each direction of phonon transport, 
and can be solved by the implicit step scheme with 
parallel computing. The steady solution is obtained 
as the maximum difference of the equilibrium 
phonon intensity between two iteration steps is less 
4 
type composite, the longitudinal thermal 
conductivity of compacted wire is lower than that of 
embedded wire. Phonons in compacted wires are 
confined along wires, while phonons in the host 
material of embedded wire can drift (in the 
direction vertical to the heat flow) more than the 
size of the unit cell without experiencing interface 
scattering. To quantify the influence of interface 
arrangement on heat transfer, we define a interface 
efficiency, e, of a composite based on the transverse 
thermal conductivity of superlattice. The thermal 
conductivities of transverse superlattice, transverse 
compacted wire, transverse compacted particle, 
transverse embedded wire, transverse embedded 
particle, longitudinal compacted wire, longitudinal 
embedded wire, and longitudinal superlattice are 
0.275, 0.399, 0.469, 0.610, 0.768, 0.917, 1.236, and 
1.791W/mK, respectively, when the interface 
density is 1nm
-1
. With the value of thermal 
conductivity, the effective interface density can be 
interpolated from the thermal conductivity data of 
transverse superlattice. The interface efficiency is 
defined as the percentage of the effective interface 
density. The scattering efficiencies of transverse 
superlattice, transverse compacted wire, transverse 
compacted particle, transverse embedded wire, 
transverse embedded particle, longitudinal 
compacted wire, longitudinal embedded wire, and 
longitudinal superlattice are 100, 69.6, 61.9, 50.3, 
37.3, 30.2, 22.6, and 15.3%, respectively. The 
interface efficiency will be affected by the intrinsic 
scattering as the interface density is decreased.  
Although the transverse scattering efficiencies of 
3D particle and 2D wire composites are lower than 
that of superlattice, the interface densities of 3D 
particle and 2D wire composites are three and two 
times larger than that of 1D superlattice for the 
same characteristic size. Fig. 4 shows the thermal 
conductivity of Si-Ge nanocomposites as a function 
of characteristic size. The characteristic size is 
ranging between 3 and 192nm. The thermal 
conductivity of embedded/compacted 3D particle is 
lower than that of 2D embedded/compacted wire, 
and the thermal conductivity of compacted 2D wire 
is lower than that of 1D superlattice. Thus, the 
advantage of 3D and 2D nanostructures for scaling 
up large interface density is clearly obtained. 
Although the interface density of embedded 3D 
composite is 50% more than that of compacted 2D 
composite for the same characteristic size, 
embedded 3D particle cannot yield lower value of 
thermal conductivity than compacted 2D wire as 
characteristic size is below 48nm. The interface 
density of embedded 2D wire is 100% more than 
that of 1D superlattice for the same characteristic 
size but the embedded 2D composite cannot yield 
lower value of thermal conductivity than 
superlattice when characteristic size is below 12nm. 
This is due to the relatively lower interface 
efficiency of embedded type composite.In the 
transverse heat transfer, although the scattering 
efficiency of compacted particle (e=61.9%) is lower 
than that of superlattice (e=100%), the interface 
density of compacted 3D particle is three times 
larger than that of 1D superlattice for the same 
characteristic size. Thus, the thermal conductivity 
of compacted particle is lower than that of 
superlattice (42.6% lower when the characteristic 
size is 3nm). In the longitudinal heat transfer, the 
interface efficiency of wire composite is better than 
superlattice. Moreover, the interface density of 2D 
wire composite is two times larger than that of 1D 
superlattice for the same characteristic size. 
Therefore, the thermal conductivity difference 
between 2D wire composite and 1D superlattice is 
much larger than that in transverse heat transfer at 
the same characteristic size. Due to better scattering 
efficiency in compacted wire composite, the 
longitudinal thermal conductivity of compacted 
wire is lower than embedded wire.  In the

The zeroth order distribution can be further 
extended to the next approximation of first order 
distribution.  The first order solutions in classical 
and quantum cases will depict distinction and

The Chapman-Enskog expansion can be applied 
to the linearized collision term or BGK model in 
both quantum and classical cases, but the procedure 
is complicated. Here we only show the expansion 
on BGK model and the expansion to the quantum 
gas is adopted instead of the classical one. We refer 
to the Chapman-Enskog expansion on classical gas.

In two dimension case, the numerical example 
used here is the two dimension shock tube 
problem with rectangular grids. One gas state is 
confined in the middle of a rectangle region 
with another gas state surrounded. The 
macroscopic quantities of the state in the 
middle are (n, jx, jy, ϵ) = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0) and 
the surrounded state (n, jx, jy, ϵ) = (0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 
1.5).
