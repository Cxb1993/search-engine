The effects of sodium ions addition on the crystal phases, microstructure development and 
varistor properties of ZnO-Pr6O11-Co3O4 ceramic were investigated using X-ray diffractometer 
(XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the electron probe microanalysis method 
(EPMA). The results indicate that the oxygen vacancies existing in Pr6O11 due to the substitution 
of Na+ for Pr ions could enhance the phase stability of Pr6O11, decrease the evaporation of Pr and 
enhance the diffusion and chemisorption of excess oxygen ions at the grain boundary. Therefore, 
the varistor characteristics of ZnO-Pr6O11-Co3O4 ceramics can be effectively improved by adding 
sodium ions.

investigated using XRD, SEM, and EPMA. The detailed relationship between the crystalline 
phases, microstructure, and varistor characteristic is identified for sodium ions-doped 
ZnO-Pr6O11-Co3O4 ceramics. 
II. Experimental Procedures 
ZnO-Pr6O11-Co3O4 ceramic powders composed of 98.5mol% ZnO- 1 mol% Co3O4- 
0.5mol% Pr6O11 were prepared from reagent-grade ZnO, Co3O4, and Pr6O11(Wako Pure 
Chemicals Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), mixed and then calcined at 750oC for 1 h. The 
powders were then milled with 0 wt% (sample ZPC) and 0.3 wt% Na2CO3 (Fluka Chemie GmbH, 
Buchs, Switzerland) (sample ZPCN) for 24 h using Y-TZP balls. The milled powders were dried 
in an oven. The dried powders were compacted using a cold isostatic press at 175 MPa. These 
specimens were then sintered at 1200-1350oC at an interval of 50oC for 2 hr. The densities of the 
sintered samples were determined using the Archimedean method. The microstructure was 
observed using scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi, S4100) and the element distribution was 
measured using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) (JEOL, JXA-8900R). The crystalline 
phase identification was determined using X-ray diffractometry (Siemens, D5000) with Cu-Kα 
radiation. The varistor properties of the samples were measured using a high voltage source meter 
(Keithley, 2410). 
III. Results and discussion 
The XRD patterns of ZPCN and ZPC samples sintered at various temperatures are shown in 
Figs.1 and 2, respectively. It shows that the samples were mainly ZnO phase accompanied with a 
little Pr6O11 phase. To compare the amounts of Pr6O11 phases existing in the samples, the 
the ZPCN sample sintered at 1300 and 1350oC. This result is in agreement with the observation 
based on XRD shown in Fig.5. Some fine Pr-rich grains with a nearly spherical shape are 
observed within the ZnO grains. It appears that the grain boundaries may sweep across the solid 
Pr6O11 particles, leaving them behind within the grains. The trapped Pr6O11 particles will then 
form liquid pockets after melting during sintering, as shown in Fig. 7. For the ZPC samples 
sintered at 1200 and 1250oC, the microstructures are similar to the ZPCN samples. However, as 
the sintering temperature increased above 1300oC, the grain growth rate drastically increased and 
the Pr6O11 phase and intergranular Pr-rich phase disappeared as a result of the formation of liquid 
phase and Pr evaporation8, as shown in Figs. 5 and 8. These results indicate that the addition of 
sodium ions could enhance the Pr6O11 phase segregation and decrease the Pr evaporation rate. 
Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show the variations in the nonlinear exponent (α) and breakdown 
voltage (Eb) with sintering temperatures for ZPCN and ZPC samples. The dependence of leakage 
current on the sintering temperature for ZPC and ZPCN samples is shown in Fig.11. The ZPCN 
samples sintered at various temperatures possessed higher nonlinear exponent, breakdown 
voltage values and lower leakage current than ZPC samples. Previous reports 9,10 have suggested 
that the varistor characteristics result from the diffusion and chemi-sorption of excess oxygen 
ions at the grain boundary. Sonder et al.11 proposed that oxygen grain boundary diffusion is the 
slower mechanism. A nonlinear (I-V) characteristic is only obtained when doping Bi or other 
large-sized ions such as Pr and Ba into ZnO ceramics. It is well known that Bi2O3 exhibits higher 
oxygen-ion conductivity and can act as a “grain boundary activator” to supply excess oxygen ions 
to the grain boundaries in Bi2O3-based ZnO varistors.12 The crystallographic structure of Pr6O11 is 
decreased with increasing sintering temperature for ZPCN and ZPC samples. Alles et al.4 
investigated the liquid phase sintering effect on Pr6O11-based ZnO varistors properties and 
observed that the liquid Pr-rich phase did not have an active role in interface states formation, and 
that the chemisorbed oxygen along the grain boundary due to Pr6O11 segregation at the grain 
boundaries was believed to be the origin of interface states. For the ZPCN and ZPC samples, the 
segregated Pr-rich phase appears to be mainly Pr6O11 at temperatures of 1200 and 1250oC. It 
became amorphous and disappeared at 1300 and 1350oC for ZPCN and ZPC samples, 
respectively. In addition, the intensity of the segregated Pr6O11 phase decreased with increasing 
sintering temperature. These results lead to the nonlinear exponent decreasing with increasing 
sintering temperature for ZPCN and ZPC samples. The breakdown voltage decreased with 
increasing sintering temperature due to the grain growth resulting from liquid phase presence.  
From the experimental results, it was found that the addition of sodium ions into 
ZnO-Pr6O11-Co3O4 ceramics could enhance the phase stability of Pr6O11 and decrease Pr 
evaporation. Wakiya et al.8 observed that the oxygen dissociation speed from Pr6O11 and the 
evaporation rate was suppressed in N2 for ZnO-Pr6O11 ceramics. Oxygen vacancies are created in 
the oxide crystal due to low oxygen partial pressure under equilibrium conditions. The defect 
equation is described by: 
Oox → 1/2O2 + Vo.. + 2e’                     (2) 
 In this case, the oxygen vacancy concentration also increases with increasing substitution of 
Na+ according to eq. (1). Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the oxygen vacancies created 
due to Na+ substitution for Pr ions enhances the phase stability of Pr6O11 and decrease Pr
