Abstract The strain-rate-intensity factor is the coefficient of the principal singular term in an expansion of the
equivalent strain rate in a series in the vicinity of maximum-friction surfaces. Its value controls the physical pro-
cesses in a thin material layer near the frictional interfaces. The objective of the present paper is to study the effects of
the pressure dependence of the yield criterion on the strain-rate-intensity factor. The results can be used to develop
new methods for predicting the evolution of material properties in the vicinity of surfaces with high friction in
metal-forming processes.

1 Introduction
It is known that maximum-friction surfaces can produce velocity singularities in rigid perfectly plastic materials
[1]. In particular, the equivalent strain rate approaches infinity in the vicinity of such surfaces according to an
inverse-square-root rule. The coefficient of the principal singular term in an expansion of the equivalent strain rate
in a series near the maximum-friction surfaces is called the strain-rate-intensity factor [1]. This factor can play a
somehow similar role in plasticity theory as the stress-intensity factor in linear elasticity. In particular, the latter is
derived from the solution for stress but is regarded as a parameter characterizing the mechanical environment as a
whole in the vicinity of crack tips [2]. The strain-rate-intensity factor can be used to predict the formation of a layer
of intensive plastic deformation in the vicinity of frictional interfaces as well as the evolution of material properties
within this layer [3,4]. Such layers frequently appear in many metal-working processes and are associated with
high velocity gradients near friction surfaces [5,6]. It follows from the mathematical structure of the solutions that

surface coincides with a characteristic and the friction surface coincides with an envelope of characteristics. The
singular velocity fields appear if and only if the friction surface coincides with an envelope of characteristics. It
is convenient to use the alternative formulation for extending the maximum-friction law to other material models
describable by hyperbolic systems of equations. In particular, the systems of plane strain and axisymmetric equa-
tions of the double-shearing model are hyperbolic. In all the considered solutions the friction surface coincides
with an envelope of characteristics. Therefore, the equivalent strain rate follows an inverse-square-root rule in the
vicinity of the maximum-friction surface [1,14,15 and Appendix A],

The major principal stress axis, coordinate curves and characteristic directions for the double-shearing model are
shown in Fig. 1. Consider a generic point M on a maximum-friction surface. It is always possible to choose the coor-
dinate system such that anα- (orβ-) curve coincides with the maximum-friction surface (the former case is illustrated
in Fig. 2). According to the maximum-friction law, this means that a characteristics direction coincides with the
tangent to this α- (or β-) curve. It follows from geometric considerations (Fig. 2) that ψ = ±ψα,ψα = π/4 + ϕ/2
on the friction surface if an α-curve coincides with the surface. Also, ψ = ±ψβ, ψβ = π/4 −ϕ/2 on the friction
surface if a β-curve coincides with the surface. In the case of classical plasticity it is necessary to put ϕ = 0 in
Figs. 1 and 2 as well as the definitions for ψα and ψβ . Thus ψα = ψβ for this model.
In the chosen coordinate system the normal strain-rate components are finite at the friction surface and, therefore,
it follows from (6) and (7) that

Since the circumferential strain rate is finite, Eq. 8 is also valid for axisymmetric problems if αβ is understood as
the coordinate system in a generic meridian plane.

This is an ideal problem for understanding the qualitative behaviour of solutions in the vicinity of frictional surfaces
since its analytic solution can be obtained without any relaxation in the boundary conditions. The problem consists

By use of (18), the shear–strain rate can be calculated as

, r → a. (19)
Comparing (8) and (19) gives

It follows from (12) and (20) that
d = D

The double-shearing model reduces to the classical plasticity model for ϕ = 0. It is seen from (21) that D → D0
as ϕ → 0. It follows from the numerical solution [17] for the double-shearing model and (9) for classical plasticity
that usl < 0. Therefore, Eq. 21 gives D > D0. According to the theory [3,4], this means that the layer of intensive
deformation in pressure-dependent materials is thicker than in pressure-independent materials. Moreover, numeri-
cal calculation has shown that usl depends on b/a and |usl |/a˙ reaches a maximum at a certain value of b/a [17].
Therefore, the value of d attains a maximum at this value of b/a as well, resulting in the thickest layer of intensive
plastic deformation in the process under consideration.
3.2 Compression of a layer between parallel plates
This problem in plasticity theory is known as Prandtl’s problem. Its solution for the rigid perfectly plastic model can
be found in any monograph on plasticity theory, for example [16, pp. 232–233]. The solution for the double-shearing
model has been given in [18]. The problem consists of compression of a layer of plastic material between two rough
parallel plates. The thickness of the layer is 2h and it is much smaller that the width of the layer, 2L (Fig. 3). It
is convenient to introduce a Cartesian coordinate system xy whose axes coincide with the planes of symmetry of
the layer. Thus x ≡ α and y ≡ β, and ξαβ should be replaced with ξxy in (8). Due to symmetry, it is sufficient
to obtain the solution in the domain x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0. The maximum-friction surface is y = h. The direction of the
friction stress, τf , assumes that ψ = −ψα on the friction surface. This boundary condition, as well as the boundary
conditions at the axis of symmetry y = 0, are exactly satisfied. On the other hand, the exact boundary conditions
at x = 0 and x = L are replaced with approximate conditions. Under these assumptions, the velocity solution for
the rigid perfectly plastic solid is

intensity factor. The corresponding strain-rate-intensity factor has been determined in [7]:

with ξrθ in (8). Due to symmetry, it is sufficient to obtain the solution in the domain θ ≥ 0. The maximum-friction
surface is determined by the equation θ = θ0. The direction of the friction assumes that ψ ≥ 0 (Fig. 4). Therefore,
the maximum-friction law has the form ψ = ψα .
The velocity field for both models is given by
ur = − B
r (c − 2 cos 2ψ), uθ = 0, (32)
where B > 0 is a constant of integration which can be related to the flow rate through the channel and is independent
of the model. For classical plasticity, the strain-rate-intensity factor resulting from the velocity field (32) has been
found in [7]

where c0 is the value of c at ϕ = 0. The angle ψ is independent of r and its dependence on θ for the double-shearing
model follows from the following equation:
dψ
dθ
= c − 2 cos 2ψ
2 (cos 2ψ + sin ϕ) . (34)
The value of c is determined from the solution of (34) satisfying the boundary condition at the axis of symmetry,
ψ = 0 at θ = 0, and the maximum-friction law. The variation of c with θ0 for different values of ϕ is shown in
Fig. 5. The dashed line corresponds to classical plasticity, c = c0. Taking into account (32) and (34), one may
determine the shear–strain rate for the double-shearing model as follows:
ξrθ = 12
∂ur
r∂θ
= B sin 2ψ
r2 (c − 2 cos 2ψ) (cos 2ψ + sin ϕ) . (35)
Expanding the right-hand side of this equation in a series in the vicinity of ψ = ψα gives
ξrθ = B2r2 (c + 2 sin ϕ) (ψα − ψ) + o

, ψ → ψα. (36)
On the other hand, expanding the right-hand side of (34) in a series in the vicinity of ψ = ψα and integrating, using
the boundary condition ψ = ψα at θ = θ0 leads to:
θ0 − θ = 2 cos ϕ

Influence of pressure dependence of the yield criterion
Several analytic and semi-analytic axisymmetric solutions for the double-shearing model are available in the
literature [20–22]. The boundary-value problem solved in [20] does not include the maximum-friction law. The
strain-rate-intensity factors have been obtained in [21,22] from the solutions given in these papers and it has been
shown that its magnitude is sensitive to pressure dependency of the yield criterion.

Appendix A, Derivation of Eq. 6
It is easy to demonstrate that the equivalent strain rate should approach infinity in the vicinity of maximum-friction
surfaces in the case of classical plasticity. The system of constitutive equations consisting of the von Mises yield
criterion and its associated flow rule is

where σij are the components of the stress tensor, δij is the Kroneker delta, σ0 is the yield stress in tension, and
σ = σij δij /3. Introduce a local Cartesian coordinate system xyz at a generic point of a maximum-friction surface
whose z-axis is orthogonal to the surface and the direction of the y-axis coincides with the velocity vector. Accord-
ing to the maximum-friction law
∣∣σyz
∣∣ = τs at points of the friction surface. Since σ0 =
√
3τs in the case of von
Mises’ yield criterion, the first equation of the system (A1) shows that σxx = σyy = σzz = σ and σxy = σxz = 0.
Inserting these equations into the second equation of the system (A1) gives
ξxx = ξyy = ξzz = ξxz = ξxy = 0, (A2)
unless ξeq → ∞. Equation A2 imposes severe restrictions on the velocity field. The simplest way to show that
there are solutions in which (A2) is not satisfied is to consider axisymmetric flow. In this case the circumferential
strain rate is solely expressed in terms of the radial velocity (no derivatives are involved in the definition for the
circumferential strain rate). The radial velocity does not vanish if the regime of sliding prevails and, therefore,
Eq. A2 is not satisfied. Assuming that (A2) is not satisfied and making a standard asymptotic analysis of (A1)
supplemented with the equilibrium equations will result in (6).

ABSTRACT 
Plane stress solutions for thin plates reveal several qualitative features which are difficult to 
handle with the use of commercial numerical codes (non-existence of solutions, singular 
solutions, rapid growth of the plastic zone with a loading parameter). In order to understand an 
effect of temperature and pressure-dependence of the yield criterion on some of such features, 
an analytic solution for a thin hollow disk inserted in a container and subject to thermal loading 
is derived. The material model is elastic-perfectly/plastic and is based on the Drucker-Prager 
yield criterion and the equation of incompressibity for plastic strains. The solution is analyzed 
for a wide range of the parameter which controls pressure-dependence of the yield criterion and 
for the range of temperature up to the level at which the entire disk becomes plastic. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
     Thin plates with holes and embedded inclusions have many structural applications. A 
significant amount of analytical and numerical research has been carried out in the area of stress 
and strain analysis of such structures (Hsu and Forman, 1975; Guven, 1991, 1992; Gamer, 1992; 
Lippmann, 1992; Mack, 1993; Bengeri and Mack, 1994; Mack and Bengeri, 1994; Ball, 1995; 
Poussard et al., 1995; Alexandrov and Alexandrova, 2001; Debski and Zyczkowski, 2002; 
Alexandrova and Alexandrov, 2004a,b; Alexandrova et al., 2004; Gupta et al., 2005; Alexandrov et al., 
2010; Chakherlou and Yaghoobi, 2010; Alexandrov et al., 2011 among others). The 
assumptions made regarding yield criterion, strain hardening and unloading have a significant 
effect on the predicted response and residual stress and strain fields (Ball, 1995). Even though 
closed form solutions involve more assumptions than numerical solutions, the former are very 
useful for studying such effects. Moreover, plane stress solutions may be singular or solutions 
may not exist under certain conditions (Debski and Zyczkowski, 2002; Alexandrova and 
Alexandrov, 2004a,b; Alexandrova et al., 2004; Alexandrov et al., 2010; Alexandrov et al., 2011). 
These features of boundary value problems can cause difficulties with their treatment by means 
of standard commercial numerical codes. In particular, some specific difficulties with numerical 
solution have been mentioned in Kleiber and Kowalczyk (1996). Therefore, closed form 
solutions can be used to verify numerical solutions. In this paper, the effect of temperature and

The elastic portions of strains are related to stresses and temperature by the classical 
Duhamel-Neumann law. The yield criterion is taken in the form (Drucker and Prager, 1952) 
 
0eq          (3) 
 
where   is the first invariant of the stress tensor (hydrostatic stress), eq  is the second invariant 
of the stress tensor (equivalent stress),   and 0  are material constants. The stress invariants 
are defined by 
 2 2 21 2 3 1 2 33,3 2eq s s s             (4) 
 
where 1 , 2  and 3  are the principal stresses. Also, 1 1s    , 2 2s     and 3 3s    . 
Obviously, the yield criterion given by Eq. (3) reduces to the von Mises yield criterion for 
0  . In this case 0  is the yield stress in tension. The plastic potential is taken in the form of 
0eq  . Then, the flow rule gives

where 1
p , 2p  and 3p  are the plastic portions of the principal strain rates and   is a non-
negative multiplier. Finally, the total strain tensor is the sum of its elastic and plastic portions. In 
terms of the principal strains,

can be expressed as rs s   . Substituting these values of zs  and s  into Eq. (4) 
results in  2 2 23eq r rs s     . Using this value of eq  the yield criterion (3) can be rewritten

Substituting the stress solution given by Eq. (10) into Eq. (11) shows that the plastic zone starts 
to develop at r a . The corresponding value of  will be denoted by e . It is determined from 
the following quadratic equation

Since c a , it follows from this equation that a c  . Therefore, when e   the stress 
distribution given by Eq.(15) is sound in the range a c     (or a r c  ). The general 
stress solution in the form given by Eq. (7) is valid in the elastic zone c r b  . Equation (8) is

The total strain components in the plastic zone can be calculated by substituting Eqs.(31) and 
(44) into Eq.(6). However, in order to find the function  a   involved in Eq.(44) it is 
necessary to find the solution in the elastic zone. 
 
Solution in the elastic zone, c r b  . 
     The general solution for the displacement given in Eq.(8) is valid in the elastic zone. 
Therefore, the total principal strains in this zone are

differentiable at r c . Within the plastic zone, the magnitude of the circumferential stress is 
practically independent of  . In particular, it is seen from Fig. 8 that the portions 0 1h h  of curve 
1, 0 2h h  of curve 2 and 0 3h h  of curve 3 practically coincide with curve 4 within the respective 
ranges. The magnitude of all three total principal strains increases with temperature (Figs.9 to 
11). The strains r  and   decrease with the radius in the range a r b  . The strain z  
decreases in the plastic zone, a r c  , but is constant in the elastic zone, c r b  . The main 
tendencies in behaviour of the plastic portions of the principal strains are the same as for the 
total strains in the plastic zone (Figs.12 to 14).  
 
 
 
An effect of pressure-dependence of the yield criterion on the distribution of stresses and strains 
is illustrated in Figs.15 to 22. In all these figures, curve 1 corresponds to 0  , curve 2 to 
0.1  , curve 3 to 0.2  , and curve 4 to 0.3  . In order to perform a comparative study, 
the value of   at which   2c b a   for 0   (pressure-independent material) has been found 
first. Then, this value of   has been used in calculations at the other values of  . Therefore, the 
radius of the elastic/plastic boundary depends on the value of   used (Fig. 4). The dependence 
of the radial stress on   is very weak (Fig. 15). Therefore, no numbers are assigned to the 
curves. In general, the value of r  increases with  . The circumferential stress significantly 
depends on   in the plastic zone (Fig. 16). The value of   increases with   in this zone. The 
dependence of the total radial and circumferential strains on   is very weak (Figs. 17 and 18). 
Therefore, no numbers are assigned to the curves. In general, the values of r  and   decrease 
with  . The total axial strain significantly depends on   (Fig. 19). The value of z  decreases

CONCLUSIONS 
 
A new analytic solution for thin disks made of plastically pressure-dependent materials subject 
to thermal loading has been found. A numerical treatment is only necessary to evaluate ordinary 
integrals. The effect of temperature and pressure-dependence of the yield criterion on the size of 
the plastic zone and the distribution of stresses and strains is illustrated.
