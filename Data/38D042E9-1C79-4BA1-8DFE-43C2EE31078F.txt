practicing engineering community believes that short stiff buildings simply do not respond to 
seismic shaking as adversely as might be predicted analytically due to the soil-structure interaction 
and wave propagation. 
    For the analysis of the dynamic response of a structure subjected to earthquakes, the ground 
motions are inputted from the base of this structure and are commonly assumed to be the free-field 
motions. Actually, the input motion should be the base-slab motions (foundation input motions) if 
there is a foundation in the structure. Differences between the free-fields motion and the foundation 
input motion result from kinematic interaction. The presence of stiff foundations on or in soil will 
cause the base-slab motion to deviate from the free-field motions [3-6]. It has been shown that 
kinematic interaction is most noticeable at high frequencies of excitation. This phenomenon may 
imply that short period structures are easier than long period ones to be affected by kinematic 
interaction since stiff structures are sensitive to high frequency motions. The purpose of this paper 
is to discuss the effects of kinematic soil-foundation- structure interaction on the maximum 
deformation demands of nonlinear SDOF systems with known relative strength. 
 
2. FOUNDATION INPUT MOTIONS 
The effects of kinematic interaction are, in general, quantified by transfer functions ( )( fH ) which 
are defined as the ratio of the foundation input motion to the free-field motion in frequency domain. 
Analytical solutions for base-slab averaging in various incident waves have been developed for 
circular and rectangular foundations [7-14]. Figure 1 shows the transfer function proposed by 
Veletsos et al. [13] for vertically incident incoherent waves, where a and b are the dimension of 
rectangular foundations, and 0~a  is a dimensionless frequency parameter. In ATC-55 document, 0~a  
is approximate estimation as follows for rectangular foundations [2].

in which ω = the circular frequency of the harmonic component of the ground motion under 
consideration, abbe = , 1n ≈ 4105.6 −× , and 2n = the square root of the soil modulus reduction 
factor. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the transfer function is actually a kind of low pass filters 
[15,16]. When the free-field motion runs through foundations, the high frequency waves of the 
free-field motion will be filtered by the foundations. With Figure 1, the foundation input motion can 
be determined as shown below. (a) Calculate Fourier transforms of the free-field motion; (b) 
multiply the amplitude obtained from Step (a) by )( fH ; (c) perform an inverse Fourier transform 
with the modified amplitude, and then the base-slab motion can be obtained. 
Figure 2 presents foundation motions which are derived from the free-field motion of the 1952 
Kern County earthquake. In this figure, square foundations (a=b= eb ) with widths of 20 and 72 m 
are adopted. Figure 3 depicts the Fourier amplitudes of the foundation input and free-field motions.

different earthquakes are used in this investigation. These ground motions are recorded on firm sites 
with average shear wave velocities between 180 and 360 m/s and are recorded on free-field stations. 
In addition, they are recorded in earthquakes with surface wave magnitudes (Ms) larger than 6.1. 
Refer to [17] for detailed information about all the used ground motions. 
 
5. STATISTICAL RESULTS 
Figure 6 shows the mean inelastic displacement ratios ( Fi ,∆ / Ui ,∆ ) corresponding to all of the 72 
ground motions for systems with different levels of strength ratios and built on different sizes of 
foundations. The mean maximum inelastic deformation demands derived from the foundation input 
motions for all systems are smaller than those derived from the free-field ones (i.e., all Fi ,∆ / Ui ,∆ < 
1.0). This means that the kinematic soil-foundation-structure interaction would not increase the 
maximum inelastic displacement demands of all structures. As indicated in the elastic acceleration 
response spectra (the preceding paragraph), the reduction of maximum deformation demands is fast 
and sharp as systems with periods of vibration less than about 0.3 s for eb =20 m, 0.5 s for eb =43 
m, and 0.8 s for eb =72 m. Although increasing the size of foundations results in the decrease of 
displacement demands, the kinematic interaction effects can almost be ignored for long period (soft) 
structures (T≥0.5 s for eb =20 m, T≥0.8 s for eb =43 m, and T≥1.2 s for eb =72 m). In addition, 
for systems having strength ratios less than 3.0 and periods of vibration greater than about 0.3 s 
(Figure 6), the inelastic displacement ratios ( Fi ,∆ / Ui ,∆ ) are nearly independent of the inelastic 
hysteretic characteristics of structures (i.e., Fi ,∆ / Ui ,∆  for R 0.3≤  and T≥0.3 s is almost identical 
to each other). 
    The mean inelastic displacement ratios are very important because they represent what can be 
expected on average. However, it is equally important to quantify the level of dispersion in the 
inelastic displacement ratio. A common and effective way to quantify the dispersion is through the 
coefficient of variation (COV), which is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. 
Figure 7 presents COVs of the inelastic displacement ratios corresponding to all ground motions 
considered here for various relative strength (R) and foundation width ( eb ). It can be seen that 
dispersion increase as the dimension of foundation and the level of strength ratios increase. The 
elastic case (R=1.0) always has the smallest errors. Dispersion is relatively high for systems with 
short periods of vibration (T< 0.3 s for eb =20 m, 0.4 s for eb =43 m, and 0.5 s for eb =72 m) 
regardless of the lateral strength ratio. Furthermore, for a given level of strength ratios, the COVs 
decrease as increasing the periods of vibration of structures. 
 
6. NONLINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES 
For earthquake-resistant design, it is desirable to have a simplified expression of the inelastic 
 6
demands due to kinematic interaction is obvious and sharp when systems have periods of 
vibration less than about 0.3 s for foundations with width ( eb ) of 20 m, 0.5 s for eb =43 m, and 
0.8 s for eb =72 m. Long period systems are almost not affected by the kinematic 
soil-foundation-structure interaction. 
(3) Increasing the dimension of foundations ( eb ) result in a decrease of the maximum inelastic 
deformation demands of structures (Figure 6) because the larger the dimension of foundations 
the more the high frequency motions are filtered (Figure 3). 
(4) For systems with strength ratios less than 3.0 and periods of vibration greater than about 0.3 s, 
the inelastic displacement ratios are nearly not affected by the relative strength ratio (R) of 
structures. That means that the effect of strength ratios on the inelastic displacement ratio can be 
ignored for systems with T≥0.3 s and R≤3.0. Moreover, the maximum reduction in inelastic 
displacement demands due to kinematic interaction can be obtained if structures have lateral 
strength ratios between 2.0 and 3.0. 
(5) Coefficients of variation of inelastic displacement ratios increase with decreasing the periods of 
vibration of systems and with increasing the width of foundations (Figure 7). Dispersion is 
relatively large for systems with periods smaller than 0.3 s ( eb =20 m), 0.4 s ( eb =43 m), and 0.5 
s ( eb =72 m). 
    Simplified equations has been derived by nonlinear regression analyses. It can be used to 
estimate the maximum inelastic displacement demands of systems subjected to foundation input 
motions from those of systems subjected to free-field motions.
