ABSTRACT 
 
A unipolar charger containing multiple discharging wires in a tube (inner diameter: 50 mm) 
was developed and tested in order to increase the aerosol flow rate and the charging efficiency of 
nanoparticles. Four gold wires of 25 µm in diameter and 15 mm in length were used as the 
discharging electrodes to generate positive ions (Ni) from 2.72×108 ions/cc to 3.87×109 ions/cc in 
concentration at the discharging voltage of +4.0~+10 KV. Monodisperse NaCl particles of 10~50 nm 
in diameter were used to test the charging efficiency and the particle loss of charged particles with 
different aerosol flow rates, corona voltages and sheath flow rates. The sheath air near the tube wall 
was found to increase the extrinsic charging efficiency, and the highest efficiency was obtained at 
+6.0 KV discharging voltage, 10 L/min aerosol flow rate and 9 L/min sheath flow rate. The extrinsic 
charging efficiency increased from 10.6 % to 74.2 % when the particle diameter was increased from 
10 to 50 nm. The TDMA (tandem differential mobility analyzer) method was used to determine the 
charge distribution and the mean charge per particle and it was found that the Fuchs charging theory 
corrected for the extrinsic charging efficiency matched with the experimental data very well.

INTRODUCTION 
Particle charging is very important to particle measurement, such as particle sizing by the 
differentially mobility analyzer[1] and to particle control, such as the removal of particles by the 
electrostatic precipitator[2]. However for nanosized particles, charging efficiency is low. As a result, 
many researchers have devoted their efforts to develop efficient aerosol chargers for nanoparticles.  
Aerosol particles can be charged by either bipolar or unipolar charging. In the case of bipolar 
charging, two competing processes, namely charging and neutralizing, lead to low charging 
efficiency which is only 4 % for 10 nm particles when they are positively charged, or 6 % when they 
are negatively charged [3]. The unipolar charging technique is aimed at achieving higher nanoparticle 
charging efficiency. Wiedensohler et al.[4] used an alternative electric field in the charging region to 
reduce particle loss to the walls. The bipolar ions were generated by a radioactive source, Cm244, 
placed in two opposite boxes. An alternative electric field was applied between screen openings near 
each box to draw unipolar ions into the charging zones at the center. The charged particles moved in 
a zigzag manner under the influence of the alternative electric field. The extrinsic changing 
efficiency was 4 % for 10 nm particles.  
To increase the charging efficiency, Chen and Pui[5] designed a unipolar charger with parallel 
aerosol and ion flow configuration to avoid particle loss. Desirable unipolar ions were separated by a 
weak electric field from bipolar ions generated by four Po210 radioactive sources. The design further 
used sheath air surrounding the aerosol flow to reduce particle loss. As a result, the extrinsic 
charging efficiency was greatly enhanced and up to 22 % for 3 nm, 48 % for 5 nm, and 65 % for 10 
nm positively charged particles was reported. So far, this design has the highest extrinsic charging 
efficiency among all unipolar charger designs. Later on, Kruis and Fissan[6] developed a Twin 
Hawitt type which used two Au wires placed in different boxes to generate unipolar ions. An 
alternative field was applied to draw unipolar ions from boxes into the charging zone. No sheath air 
was added. The extrinsic charging efficiency achieved was about 30 % for 10 nm positive particles. 
Later on, another diffusion charger was constructed and evaluated by Biskos et al.[7]. The charger 
has two concentric electrodes with a corona wire placed along the axis. The ions move from the 
central toward the inner perforated electrode due to high electric field. Afterward, an AC voltage 
was applied on the outer electrode to increase ion penetration and reduce particle loss on the walls. 
The extrinsic charging efficiency achieved was 25 % and 60 % for 10 nm and 20 nm positively 
charged particles, respectively.  
Alonso et al.[8] proposed a corona charger with a simple configuration. The corona discharge 
takes place around a sharp-point stainless steel electrode, and aerosols collide directly with unipolar 
ions. The extrinsic charging efficiency of nanoparticles is similar to that of other complex designs. 
The purpose of this work is to design another simple charger: a wire-in-tube unipolar charger 
with multiple discharging wires, and evaluate the extrinsic charging efficiency at different operating 
conditions aiming at increasing the aerosol flow rate and charging efficiency. Similar attempt to 
increase the aerosol flow of the charger was published by Cheng et al. [9] but the extrinsic charging 
efficiency was not reported. In this study, the charge distribution and mean charge of nanoparticles 
were also measured and compared with that predicted using Fuchs charging theory[10].  
length of the discharging wires; is the elementary charge (1.6×10e -19 C), εo is the permittivity of a 
vacuum (8.85 x 10-12 C2/N-m2).  
The ion number concentration variation with the applied positive voltage is shown in Fig. 3. When 
the positive corona voltage increases from +4.0 KV to +10 KV, ion concentration will increase 
from 2.72×108 to 3.87×109 ions/cm3, as calculated by Eq. (2). The residence time of the aerosol 
flow in the charging zone is 0.68 to 0.14 sec when the aerosol flow rate is 2 L/min to 10 L/min. 
These ion concentration values are higher than the concentrations in previous researches. For 
example, Ni in Chen and Pui[5] is 2.56 ×107 ions/cm3 and the maximum Ni in Kruis and Fissan[6] is 
about 8 ×107 ions/cm3.  As a result, diffusion charging by unipolar ions will be more efficient 
under the same conditions as long as the electrostatic loss of particles is kept small. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Charging Performance Evaluation 
 
Fig. 4 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental setup used for measuring charging 
efficiency and the particle loss of the charger in the laboratory. Nano-sized NaCl particles generated 
by the evaporation-condensation technique were neutralized by an electrostatic neutralizer (model 
3077, TSI Inc.), and classified in the Nano-DMA (Nano-differential mobility analyzer, model 3085, 
TSI Inc.). The singly charged monodisperse particles were then passed through another TSI 3077 
neutralizer and an electrostatic precipitator to remove all charged particles. Only uncharged 
particles were introduced into the unipolar charger. Before entering the charger, an additional clean 
air was mixed with uncharged particles to increase the aerosol flow rate. In the charging zone, 
sheath air could be introduced from the 0.5 mm wide annular slit along the inner wall of the charger. 
After charged aerosol flow exited the charger, it was further introduced into a charge analyzer 
designed based on Tsai et al. [12] and Forsyth et al.[13] and a CPC (condensation particle counter, 
model 3022, TSI Inc.) to measure particle electrostatic charges.  
There are four parameters used for evaluating the charging performance of a unipolar charger, 
including intrinsic charging efficiency (ηint), extrinsic charging efficiency (ηext), electrostatic loss 
(Lel), and diffusion loss (L0d), which are calculated by the following expressions [14] :

flow below 4 L/min, the extrinsic charging efficiency decreases from 26 % with increasing corona 
voltage from 4.6 to 6.4 KV. At higher aerosol flow than 4 L/min, the corona voltage does not affect 
the extrinsic charging efficiency very much and the efficiency maintains between 30 to 40 %. The 
highest extrinsic charging efficiency is obtained at the highest aerosol flow rate of 10 L/min 
corresponding to the shortest aerosol residence time of 0.14 sec. Experimental data of particle 
electrostatic loss show that as the corona voltage increases, the loss also increases which offsets the 
increase of the intrinsic charging efficiency. As a result, the corona voltage does not affect the 
extrinsic charging efficiency very much when the aerosol flow rate is greater than 4 L/min.  
 
Effect of sheath air flow rate  
 
To reduce the electrostatic loss, sheath air was added. The results of extrinsic charging 
efficiency are shown in Fig 7 for 10-50 nm NaCl particles at 4 L/min aerosol flow rate, + 5.4 KV 
corona voltage, and different sheath flow rates from 0 to 9 L/min. Depending on the particle 
diameter, the extrinsic charging efficiency of particles larger than 20 nm ranges from 30 to 70 %, 
which is enhanced by about 10-30 % by using the sheath air flow. This increase is due to the 
prevention of charged particle deposition on the wall and the reduction of electrostatic loss, as 
shown in Fig. 8. Without using the sheath air, the loss is severe which ranges from 45 to 50 % for 
particles from 10 to 50 nm. The loss decreases almost linearly to 5 to 20 % as the sheath flow is 
increased to 9 L/min. 
For 10 nm particles, the extrinsic efficiency does not seem to be affected by the sheath flow rate as 
shown in Fig. 7. The reason is due to the increasing diffusion loss of 10 nm particles with 
increasing sheath air flow rate as shown in Fig. 9. However for other particle sizes, the diffusion 
loss remains below 20 % and does not change very much with the sheath air flow rate. Such 
differences are suspected to be due to the lack of strength or non-uniformity of the sheath air flow 
velocity as it exists from the 0.5 mm slit. This sheath air problem will be investigated further to 
better explain the data shown in Fig. 9 and reduce the particle loss in the charger. 
According to the previous results, higher extrinsic charging efficiency can be obtained with a 
sufficiently high discharging voltage at high aerosol flow and sheath air flow rates. Experiment was 
therefore conducted at 10 L/min aerosol flow and 9 L/min sheath flow at four different discharging 
voltages from 5.4 to 6.8 KV and results are shown in. Fig. 10. The best extrinsic charging 
efficiency of 10.6 to 74.2 % for particles ranging from 10-50nm is seen to occur at +6.0 KV. The 
charging efficiency at other corona voltages is similar but slightly lower. Comparing with the 
maximum extrinsic charging efficiency attainable in previous designs, the present charger is about 
20-30 % lower. The differences are due to large particle loss that still exists in the present charger. 
There is 15 % electrostatic loss and 10 % diffusion loss for particles above 20 nm, and severe 
diffusion loss of 50 % for 10 nm particles. Therefore, the loss needs to be further reduced. One 
possible solution is to increase the sheath air velocity and uniformity by reducing the gap between 
the aluminum shroud and the tube wall.

INTRODUCTION
In many studies of aerosol transport, aerosol
instrumentation and aerosol control in vacuum
conditions, test aerosols of a known size are normally
produced at atmospheric pressure and injected through
a critical orifice into a vacuum chamber. When the
particle concentration in the upstream of the orifice is
used as a reference concentration for the experiment, it
is important to minimize particle loss in the orifice. If
a device such as an axial flow cyclone (Tsai et al., 2004)
operating downstream of the orifice is used to classify
valuable nanopowders, it is desirable not to loose
powders in the orifice.
Lee et al. (1993) reviewed the particle deposition
mechanisms in the orifice-type pressure reducers
including inertial impaction at the front side and the
back side of the orifice, and on the chamber wall
downstream of the orifice. The loss of very small
particles can also occur due to diffusional mechanism.
The purpose of the present study is to determine
particle loss in an existing critical orifice and to
improve the particle transmission efficiency using a
conical inlet installed before the orifice following the
method of Chen and Pui (1995).
METHODS
The experimental set-up is as shown in figure 1.
The sodium chloride aerosol particles were generated
using an automizer (TSI, model 3076) and then passed
through silica gel diffusion dryer. The evaporation-
condensation method using a tube furnace was
employed to generate ultrafine aerosol particles. The
aerosols were passed through a NDMA (TSI, model
3085) to obtain monodisperse aerosol particles of 27-
177 nm in aerodynamic diameter. The LDMA (TSI,
3071) was used to classify monodisperse aerosol
particles of 132- 856 nm. The orifice No. 9 (O' Keefe
Controls Co.) was used in this experiment. The
monodisperse aerosols were passed through the orifice
or the by pass line alternately to measure the
downstream and upstream aerosol concentrations with
the help of two valves, respectively. The electrical
current corresponding to particle concentration was
measured by an electrometer (TSI, model 3068).
A conical inlet was designed for the orifice
assembly following the method of Chen and Pui (1995)
to improve the particle transmission efficiency. This
conical inlet was installed right in front of the critical
orifice.

To quantify the amount of particles deposited on
different deposition sites, the orifice assembly orifice
was disassembled and deposited NaCl particles were
wiped using cotton swabs after the experiment. The
wiped cotton swabs were then dissolved in DI water
and analyzed by ion chromatography (Model DX-120,
Dionex Corp.) for the chlorine ion concentrations at
different parts of the orifice assembly.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The transmission efficiency versus the aerodynamic
diameter for naoparticles using the E9 orifice and the
E9 orifice with the conical inlet at different flow rates
are shown in Fig. 2. The transmission efficiency is
found to be 100 % for particle from 27–177 nm when
the flow rate through the orifice reaches the critical
condition using both the E9 orifice and the E9 orifice
with the conical inlet. However, when the flow rate is
smaller than the critical flow rate, the diffusion loss of
particles with Dpa<126 nm increases with decreasing
flow rate and decreasing particle size. For the E-9
orifice, the transmission efficiency for particle with
Dpa=27nm is decreased from 100% to 80.4 % and 73 %
as the flow rate is decreased from the critical flow rate
of 0.455 slpm to 0.357 slpm and 0.242 slpm,
respectively. Improvement of the transmission
efficiency is observed for all flow rates and particle
sizes by using the E9 orifice with the conical inlet. For
27 nm particles, the efficiency is increased from 73%
to 83% at 0.242 slpm.
