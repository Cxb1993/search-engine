The CDS pattern DGS (CDS-DGS) is formed on the 
ground plane with the CDS pattern etching. There is no 
open-stub junction element needed to connect the open-
stub, high impedance line, and the step junctions between 
different impedance lines. The dimensions of CDS-DGS 
as illustrated in Fig. 2(b) are d=e=f=4mm, g=1mm, 
h=3.5mm, and i=2.5mm. The CDS-DGS-LPF (called 
Type1) has been realized in Fig.3. The etched area is 
approximately 16mmx14mm. 
An improved CDS-DGS shown in Fig.4 is proposed to 
have two dumbbell-shaped pattern added in order to make 
the cutoff frequency become sharper. The dumbbell-
shaped pattern has etching dimensions of j=6mm, 
k=3mm, and l=8mm. The length of the microstrip line on 
the top layer is adjusted to c=27mm. Photographs of the 
proposed CDS-DGS-LPF (called Type2) is illustrated in 
Fig. 5. The overall etched area is approximately 
27mmx14mm. 
III. SIMULATION AND MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
The frequency responses of CDS-DGS-LPFs are 
simulated using an EM simulator. The substrate material 
is FR4 with dielectric constant of 4.6 and thickness of 
0.8mm. The measurements of the proposed LPFs are done 
by an Agilent N5230A network analyzer to measure the 
return loss and the insertion loss of both Type1 and 
Type2. The performances of the return loss and the 
insertion loss are denoted as S11 and S21 parameters, 
respectively.

Abstract  — A novel microstrip dual-band bandpass filter 
(BPF) is proposed in this paper. The designed BPF consists 
of an open-loop resonator on the top layer and defected 
ground structure (DGS) with a pair of U-shape stepped 
impedance resonator (SIR) on the bottom layer. The first 
passband at 2.4GHz is determined by the SIR-DGS, and the 
second passband at 5.2GHz is performed by the open-loop 
geometry structure. The measured results of the insertion 
losses are -1.83dB and -2.4dB at 2.4GHz and 5.2GHz, 
respectively. The return losses are -38.5dB at 2.4GHz and -
20.8dB at 5.2GHz. The substrate material for fabrication is 
FR4 with permittivity of 4.4 and the thickness of 1mm. The 
total area is 36.9mmx11.2mm.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The increasing demand of the wireless communication 
applications requires the radio frequency (RF) receivers to 
be operated in multiple frequency bands so that users can 
access different services with a single handset. Recently, 
the dual-band operation has become an extensively 
attractive investigation. For example, the global system 
for mobile (GSM) is operated at the frequency of 0.9/1.8 
GHz and the wireless local area network (WLAN) is 
operated at the frequency of 2.4/5.2 GHz [1][2].  
In designing the RF receivers, a bandpass filter (BPF) 
is added to perform the filtering of the unwanted signals 
and to pass the signals of the specific frequency from 
antenna. For dual-band operations, a dual-mode BPF 
which employing the microstrip line theory has been 
receiving a great interest [3]–[11]. However, most of the 
dual-band BPFs use the parallel-coupled half-wavelength 
microstrips to achieve two passbands. The sizes of the 
filter employ such patterns are considered too large to be 
utilized in the modem wireless and mobile systems. Thus 
size reduction becomes an important issue in the 
microwave filter design. Hence, using microstrip line (top) 
layer and the ground (bottom) layer to implement two 
different passband can be resulted into a compact 
topology.

II. DESIGN OF DUAL-BAND BANDPASS FILTER 
A microstrip dual-band BPF for WLAN application is 
shown in Fig. 1. A pair of half-wavelength open-loop 
resonators on the top layer with electric coupling 
structure, referred to as the main structure, can be 
resonated at 5.2GHz. On the other hand, a symmetric 
bended squared SIR structure is introduced on the bottom 
layer. The defected ground structure (DGS) with SIR, 
referred to as the substructure, causes the passband of 
2.4GHz. Therefore, two passbands are provided without 
increasing the main size of the resonators.  
An FR4 substrate with thickness of 1.0mm and 
permittivity ε
r 
of 4.4 is used to implement the presented 
dual-band BPF. The feed line with 1.8mm width is 
designed to match the characteristic impedance 50  of a 
microstrip line. Fig. 2 (a) and (b) show the patterns of the 
top layer and the bottom layer of the filter, respectively.

Both passbands meet the specifications of the modern 
wireless communication systems. Furthermore, the three 
transmission zeros are -43.7dB at 1.45 GHz, -25.5dB at 
2.712GHz, and -34 dB at 4.05GHz. In the filter structure, 
the input/output 50  microstrip lines are taped to the first 
and the last resonators as the external coupling structures. 
The BPF is fabricated with the height h=1.0mm, 
composing to 0.003mm copper layer on top and bottom 
layers with the loss tan of 0.0245. 
Fig. 7(a) shows the simulation results of the bottom 
layer without the open-loop resonator on the top.  It is 
obvious that only one passband at 2.4GHz is found in 
DGS with SIR resonator. 
Fig. 7(b) is the simulation of the top and the bottom 
layers. When open-loop resonator is introduced on the top 
layer, another passband at 5.2GHz is excited along with 
the resonant frequency of 2.4GHz produced by the bottom 
layer. The simulation results of the insertion loss and the 
return loss of the passband at 2.4GHz are -1.03dB and -
23dB, respectively. In the 5.2GHz passband, the insertion 
loss is -2.4dB and the return loss is -20dB.  
Fig.7(c) depicts the simulation results of the top and the 
bottom layer with U-shape. Fig.7(c) shows the first 
resonant frequency f1 = 2.4GHz and the second resonant frequency f2 = 5.2 GHz. The insertion loss and return loss are -1.03dB and -25dB for the first resonant frequency, 
and are -2.165dB and -21dB for the second resonant 
frequency. Three transmission zeros are -74.38dB at 
1.27GHz, -36.92dB at 2.837GHz, and -54.42dB at 
4.15GHz.  
Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the substance photograph of the 
proposed dual-band BPF. The total area is 
36.9mmx11.2mm. An Agilent N5230A network analyzer 
is used to measure the return loss S11 and insertion loss 
S21 of the filter. The measured results of the dual-band 
BPF are shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Fig.9, the first 
resonant frequency is 2.4GHz and the second frequency is 
5.2GHz. For 2.4GHz, the measured insertion loss and 
return loss are -1.83dB and -38.5dB, respectively. For 
5.2GHz, the measurement results of the insertion loss and 
the return loss are -2.4dB and -20.8dB, respectively. 
The specifications of both simulation and measurement 
results of the dual-band BPF are listed in Table II.
