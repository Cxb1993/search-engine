英文摘要 
Coverage holes occur in wireless sensor network 
due to random deployment of nodes. Presence of 
such holes in sensor networks has important 
consequences on the information flow and 
capacity across the network and on the 
perceptual coverage of the network. Though, 
several protocols can be designed for the hole 
detection, modeling of such hole detection and 
hole recovery problems using mathematical 
methods is highly essential. Hence, in this 
project various problems of coverage hole 
detection and hole recovery are analyzed and 
modeled using mathematics as a tool. Coverage 
hole detection methods are designed using 
computational geometry and hole recovery 
methods are developed using vector methods. 
Communication system is implemented among 
the Octopus II sensor nodes to detect the 
presence of coverage holes.

二、 緣由與目的  
Coverage hole detection and repair [1] in 
wireless sensor networks are fundamental 
problem and have not been well studied over 
past few years. Identification of holes in a 
wireless sensor network is of primary interest 
since the breakdown of sensor nodes in a larger 
area often indicates one of the special events to 
be monitored by the network in the first place 
(e.g. outbreak of a fire, destruction by an 
earthquakes etc.) [2, 3]. In the random 
distribution, it could be possible that no nodes 
reach some regions during the initial distribution 
process of the sensors and create the sensing 
holes. It could be possible that nodes have 
exhausted their power resources or have been 
damaged by some natural phenomena and 
generate the holes in the post deployment 
scenarios. These regions are called 
“communication voids”. Besides, due to nature 
of the deployment such as sensor nodes are 
thrown away randomly over a region of interest, 
a node may have many nodes as neighbors, 
where some other nodes may not have neighbors. 
Because of these characteristics of deployment, 
sensing redundancy is inevitable among the 
nodes' sensing areas. It is also useful to compute 
the location of holes in the network fabric from 
remote locations. 
From the review of several literatures, it is 
observed that very limited works have done 
along the direction of hole detection and

Fig. 2(b): Formation of triangle by any three 
nodes.        
Each node finds its neighbor’s list as shown in 
Figure 3. For example, as shown in Figure 3, X 
can find its one-hop neighbor’s set that contains 
A, B, C and D and two-hop neighbor’s set that 
contains P, Q, R, S, T, M, N and O. 
  
 
 
Fig. 3: Example of finding neighbor’s list by a 
node X within twice of its communication range.  
 
As soon as each node gets its neighbor list, the 
hole detection phase is executed distributively. 
Any node can initiates the hole detection 
procedure, which can be referred to as a 
reference node. At the time of execution of hole 
detection phase, it is assumed that the circum 
radius (R) and circum center (Z) of a triangle are 
calculated from the location information of the 
reference node and its one pair of neighbors, 
which are self organized by the nodes. The 
theoretical basis of the hole detection algorithm 
is verified by several lemmas and corollaries. As 
shown in Figure 4, no coverage hole is found 
based on our hole detection protocol. 
 reference node with its two-hop neighbors such 
that the angle subtended at the reference node is 
acute and R <= Rs, then no hole exists within 
them, otherwise a hole must exists if circum 
center Z is not covered by any other sensor. 
Lemma 6. If an obtuse triangle is formed by a 
reference node with its two-hop neighbors and 
the angle subtended at the reference node is 
obtuse, coverage hole exists in between those 
two-hop neighbors. 
Lemma 7. If an acute triangle is formed by a 
reference node with one of its one hop neighbor 
and another one with its two-hop neighbors, no 
hole exists if R <= Rs, otherwise, coverage hole 
exists within them. 
Lemma 8. If an obtuse triangle is formed by a 
reference node with one of its one-hop neighbor 
and another one with its two-hop neighbors, 
such that angle subtended at the reference node 
is acute, no hole exists within them if R <= Rs, 
otherwise a hole must exist if circum center Z is 
not covered by any other sensor. 
Lemma 9. If the triangle formed by a reference 
node with one of its one-hop neighbor and 
another one with its two-hop neighbors subtends 
an obtuse angle at the reference node, hole exists 
within those neighbors. 
B. Coverage Hole Recovery Model 
      In this part of our project, we propose the 
distributed coverage hole recovery algorithms 
and main contributions of our work can be 
summarized as follows: 
 Distributed coverage hole repair 
algorithms are proposed to recover the 
holes that use the laws of vectors as the 
tool to decide the magnitude and 
direction of the mobile nodes. 
 In contrast to other mobility based hole 
recovery protocols, mobility of nodes in 
our protocol is limited within only 
one-hop so that energy consumption due 
to mobility could be minimized. 
 In our protocol, decision of mobility 
needs limited computation as it uses 
vector methods to decide the magnitude 
and direction of mobility and therefore 
more efficient as compared to other hole 
recovery protocols.  
 In our algorithm, though redundant nodes 
with higher coverage degree may move 
to recover a hole, a mobile node does not 
increase its existing coverage degree and 
therefore further coverage overlapping is 
reduced. 
It is assumed that sensors are deployed randomly 
and densely over the monitoring region such that 
some regions of the network have coverage holes 
due to absence of sensors, whereas nodes of 
some other regions have higher degree of 
neighbors. Due to the dense deployment of the 
nodes, several redundant nodes may be present 
in the network. Each node is aware of its own 
location and coordinates of the boundaries of the 
deployed region through location services [5]. 
Each node is capable of moving.  
     
    
Fig. 6: Example of network environment. 
        It is assumed that each node has a unique ID 
and is equipped with homogeneous sensing and 
transmission devices and communication range 
(Rc) of each node is equal to twice of the sensing 
(Rs). At the time of deployment, it is assumed 
that there are multiple coverage holes present in 
the network. However, the nodes around the 
coverage holes are connected and are aware of 
the location of their nearest coverage holes. Due 
to the random deployment of nodes, it is 
assumed that probability of intersection of 
sensing discs of any three sensors at a single 
point is zero. Besides, no two sensors are located 
at a single point and each sensor has at least two

Figure 9(b): Angle of boundary gap > π 
 
Then the mobility distance calculation algorithm 
is developed to find the maximum mobility 
distance of a node that can move to recover a 
coverage hole without disturbing the existing 
coverage due to its mobility. Besides, the mobile 
node should not increase its highest k-coverage 
and other sensors after its movement to a new 
position. Hence, by moving a sensor from one 
position to another to recover a hole, coverage 
overlapping could be reduced. An example of 
finding mobility distance of a node is shown in 
Figure 10. Let, S be a mobile node that wants to 
calculate its mobility distance. Let, A, B, and C 
be the close-workers and D, E, F and G be the 
co-workers of S. 
 
 
Fig. 10: Example of multi-grid node scheduling. 
 
Taking the close and co-worker’s 
communication range, the maximum mobility 
distance is calculated. As shown in Figure 10, Sc 
represents the maximum mobility distance.  It is 
to be noted that in our algorithms, mobility of the 
nodes is limited within only one-hop. Besides, 
the mobility of a node does not affect the existing 
coverage and initial k-coverage degree of the 
nodes that enclose the holes is not increased due 
to its mobility to recover the holes, which are 
verified by the following lemmas. 
 
LEMMA 1: Mobility of a node is limited within 
its one-hop. 
LEMMA 2: Connectivity of a node (source 
node) with its close-workers is not lost after its 
mobility. 
LEMMA 3: Initial k-coverage of the nodes that 
enclose a hole is not increased due to mobility of 
another node to recover that hole. 
LEMMA 4: A node having at least two boundary 
gaps, cannot move to recover a hole. 
LEMMA 5: If angle of boundary gap µ of a node 
is < π, it can move. 
LEMMA 6: If angle of boundary gap µ of a node 
is > π, mobility direction of that node should be 
along vector VR.
