ABSTRACT
The goal of this NSC project is, via dissipative control, to
solve a stabilization problem for fuzzy systems with sector-
bounded nonlinearities at their input. We first reformulate
the problems in a new, related stabilization problem such
that the closed-loop fuzzy system is dissipative with respect
to a specifically chosen quadratic supply rate. Then, based
on Lyapunov method, we derive the stabilization conditions
for a state feedback stabilizing controller, leading to an LMI
representation that can be numerically solved by existing SOS
(Sum of Squares) solvers. Finally the validity of the proposed
method is illuminated by examples.
Keywords: Dissipative control, Sector-bounded nonlinearity,
Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models, Linear matrix inequality (LMI)
I. INTRODUCTION
OVER the decades, a large number of important results onstabilization have been derived for Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy
models, which rely on existence of a common P to a quadratic
Lyapunov function. Following the progress, the robust fuzzy
control problems for uncertain fuzzy systems characterized
by 2-norm structure have been the main topic of research
[1]. Other than stability and robust issues, performance of
a control system also attracts attention. Generally speaking,
robust stability can be categorized into two areas: Stability
robustness concerns stability problems of a control system
subject to parameter uncertainties [2]-[6]. Performance robust-
ness focuses on performance problems such as H∞ and/or
H2 while the underlying system is under plant parametric
variations [7]-[12].
In a broader view, a fuzzy system may have nonlinear
functions such as parameter uncertainties, saturating inputs
involved in the model [13], [14]. For problems involving
robustness analysis with sector-bounded framework entering
nonlinearly into the input and output, how to tackle such
problems becomes the focus of this paper. To name a few,
such systems are commonly found in practice resulted from
failing actuators or sensors. It is also noted that saturation/dead
zone in the actuator response and hysteresis in the physical
response of magnetic or elastic material are classified into the
category of sector-bounded nonlinearity.
Moreover, introduced by Willems [15], [16] and subse-
quently generalized by Hill and Moylan [17], the theory of
dissipative systems has played an important role in systems
and control problems, incorporating basic tools – bounded
real lemma, passitivity lemma and circle criterion – into one
general quadratic form known as supply rate. Literature on
dissipative systems theory can be found on [18], [19], [20]
and references therein, although there has been a considerable
research results on dissipative nonlinear systems, the results
all require solving a nonlinear partial differential equation,
imposing difficulties in controller synthesis. [21] studied dis-
sipative state/observed-state feedback control problem. [13]
employed a set invariance analysis technique to characterize a
contractively invariant set, resulting in a set of LMI constraints
depending on initial conditions or reference set. Motivated by
the work [18], [1], [21] we investigate a unified approach
to synthesize stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems
represented by Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models.
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section II
re-derives fuzzy version of dissipative theorem expressed
in an LMI formulation, covering continuous-time systems.
In section III, stabilization problems via state feedback is
addressed. One illustrative example is considered in Section
IV and concluding remarks are made in Section V.

A. General nonlinear systems
Consider the following nonlinear systems described by
x˙(t) = A(x) +B(x)w(t), x(0) = x0 (1)
z(t) = C(x) +D(x)w(t) (2)

III. STATE FEEDBACK CONTROL
Consider the following nonlinear fuzzy control systems with
sector-bounded nonlinearity entering into the system input due
to saturation at the input terminals.
x˙(t) = Aµx(t) +Bµφ(u, t), x(0) = x0 (7)
and the state feedback controller displayed below
u = Kµx (8)
where Kµ =
∑r
i µiKi is the state feedback gain to be
determined and φ(u, t) is a nonlinear saturation input that
satisfies the following definition:
Definition 2 (Sector-bounded Nonlinearity): Let
L1=diag(α1, α2, · · · , αm) and L2 = diag(β1, β2,
· · · , βm) be two given diagonal matrices, the nonlinearity
is characterized by the following sector-bounded set
Φnon = {φ(z, ·) : R
s × R+ → Rm such that
(φ− L1z)
′(φ− L2z) ≤ 0.}
The function φ(z, ·) defined above represents a memoryless,
possibly time-varying nonlinearity. It is assumed that φ(z, ·)
satisfies the Lipschitz condition ||φ(z1, ·)−φ(z2, ·)|| ≤ L||z1−
z2|| for all (z1, ·) and (z2, ·) ∈ Rs × R+, where the positive
constant L is called the Lipschitz constant.
The control objective here is to find a state feedback control
law (8) subject to input saturation for the underlying fuzzy
system (7). To this end, we decompose the nonlinear input
φ(u, t) of the system (7) into linear part and saturation part.
That is,
φ(u, t) = Kµx+ ω.
where ω is a nonlinear saturation term. A simple substitution
into (7) leads to
x˙ = (Aµ +BµKµ)x+Bµω
z = u = Kµx.
which is equivalent to the following compact form:[
x˙
z

=
[
Aµ +BµKµ Bµ
Kµ 0

]
(9)
To view the sector-bounded nonlinear input φ(u, t) as the
supply rate rq , the following derivation is required [18]:
0 > (φ− L1z)
T (φ− L2z), and φ = z + ω
= (z + ω − L1z)
T (z + ω − L2z)
= ωTω + zT (I − LT1 )ω + ω
T (I − L2)z
+zT (I − LT1 )(I − L2)z.
Defining L1 = I − L1 and L2 = I − L2 leads to
ωTω + ωT (L1 + L2)z + z
T (L

Comparing(10) with (3), it is clear that

L1 = (I − L1), L2 = (I − L2)
Theorem 2: Given the nonlinear system (7) with the
sector-bounded nonlinearities φ ∈ Φnon, the closed-loop
system is asymptotically stable in a dissipative sense with
respect to (Q,S,R) if there exist matrix F and G = GT > 0
such that
Mij +Mji < 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ r (11)
where
Mij =

 AiG+BiFj + (⋆) Bi − FTi ST FTi(⋆) −Q 0
(⋆) (⋆) R−1

 (12)
Proof: Recalling system (9), we can replace Aµ with
Aµ + BµKµ, Cµ = Kµ, Dµ = 0 in Theorem 1 and it is
displayed below.
 (Aµ +BµKµ)G+ (⋆) Bµ −GKTµ ST GKTµ(⋆) −Q 0
(⋆) (⋆) R−1


< 0.
Letting Fµ = KµG, we have
 AµG+BµFµ + (⋆) Bµ − FTµ ST FTµ(⋆) −Q 0
(⋆) (⋆) R−1

 < 0.
Factoring out the grade of membership µ, we arrive at (13)
on the top of next page. Thus, the theorem is proved.
IV. SUM OF SQUARES
Applying Lyapunov-based quadratic stability to the afore-
mentioned fuzzy control system (9), Theorem 2 is shown to
bear the following form
Mµµ < 0 (14)
By applying matrix-valued Po´lya’s Theorem [22], [23], [24],
(14) leads to
(
r∑
i=1

dMµµ < 0 (15)
The PD-LMIs (15) comprise of infinitely many LMIs, thus
being a feasibility problem of infinite dimensions. We need
to obtain a set of convex finite-dimensional LMI conditions
associated to PD-LMIs (15) so that the relaxation becomes

VI. CONCLUSION
A complete solution to a state feedback stabilization prob-
lem involving input saturations is presented. The saturation
input is decomposed into linear part and nonlinear part. The
latter is then expressed in (Q,S,R) parameter, known as
supply rate. The dissipative control scheme is applied to derive
a sum of squares test condition. Although only continuous-
time systems are investigated in detail, a unified treatment
applicable to discrete-time counterparts is readily obtainable.
An example is demonstrated to validate the theorem de-
rived.
