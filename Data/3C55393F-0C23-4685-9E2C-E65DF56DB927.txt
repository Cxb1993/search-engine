High Payload Mission UAV System for Civilian Surveillance 
 
ABSTRACT 
A mission UAV is developed with distinct functions and various payloads for surveillance 
purpose.  A 3.6 m wing span full glass fiber fixed wing UAV system is developed for high 
payload applications using a 157 cc engine to provide ample power for maneuvering. An 
autopilot flight control system containing MEMS and microprocessor hardware is developed 
for remote operation via multiple communication links.  Its autopilot follows the defined 
GPS navigation waypoints and their 3D constraints from accurate QNH altitude correction. 
For image acquisition, high quality camera sets are equipped with fast 25 time zoom-in 
mechanics. The proposed Cardinal UAV system is tested on an ultra-light airfield.  Some 
advanced flight performance data are verified by continuing flight test programs.  The 
proposed UAV focuses on civilian applications for homeland security, disaster surveillance, 
rescue search and environment protection.  
Keywords: MEMS Avionics, Path Plan Autopilot, QNH Altitude Correction, Surveillance 
Application. 
 
1. Introduction 
Civilian unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are studied to provide persistent 
surveillance data acquisition for predefined missions.  In academic UAV research, most 
works are conducted under very limited budgets by considering overall flight performance 
with some significance for study.  This goal usually considers a complete solution for fully 
automated, unsupervised path planning and control of UAVs, but remains a difficult 
undertaking due to operational and hardware restrictions [1].  
In disaster surveillance and rescue search applications, UAV requires high performance 
to overcome poor weather conditions of strong head winds and rain with heavier payloads.  
Under such consideration, a UAV carries delicate cameras for territorial search being a 
practical demand.  Different types of cameras are used to search under adverse conditions 
from low altitudes.  Two contrasting applications in poor weather earth monitoring require 
enough thrust to resist high headwinds for cruising and homing, and enough drag and lift for 
image acquisition payloads at lower speed.  How can a UAV endure long haul operation 
becomes another new challenge.  UAV design needs to include more parameters in 
implementation.  
MEMS devices are the most commonly adopted technology to implement miniature 
avionics for UAVs [2] for data acquisition and autopilot flight control.  MEMS devices are 
mature for adoption such as (a) pressure sensors for pitot and static pressure measurement, (b) 
gyroscopes for spatial vector measurement, accelerometers for directional acceleration, (c)

longer power demand. On board power generation is an important design consideration.  A 
motorcycle DC generator is selected to mount on engine as a steady power source.  The 
UAV modification extends a structure fuel tank design in the middle wing section for extra 
fuel.  Together with high capacity fuel tank and DC power generator, a long haul mission 
UAV can be viable.   
In August 2009 several villages in Taiwan were overwhelmed by a muddy flood disaster 
due to extremely heavy rainfall within a day. The rescue force was not able to well control the 
situation in the mountainous areas until a few days later.  Some other similar cases happened 
in Taiwan, China, Japan and other countries in 2010.  To contribute for surveillance and 
rescue demands, the proposal Cardinal UAV system plays as a point to precede the disaster 
rescue forces for aerial image acquisition for immediate analysis.  
Some preliminary test results on the high payload mission UAV are presented and 
demonstrated in this paper.  The proposed Cardinal UAV system is working on continuous 
modification and verification for better performance to suit for surveillance mission 
operations.   
 
2. System Design 
2.1 Cardinal 71 
The Cardinal UAV system has surveillance mission demand for large cabin space to 
accept different payload and high thrust power for higher payload.  Its design considerations 
are described as the following demand specifications: (1) Cabin space: large enough for 
payloads, (2) Take-off weight >45 kgw for payload >22 kg, (3) Short take-off distance <60 m, 
at take-off speed <75 km/hr,  (4) Cruise ceiling < 3000 feet MSL, (5) Cruise Speed >120 
km/hr, mission low speed< 60 km/hr, (6) Range: 300 km max.  The Cardinal UAV (Ce-71) 
is designed with (1) Wing span: 360 cm, (2) Length: 250 cm, (3) Cabin space: 
38Hx28Wx130L cm, (4) Wing: NACA 4412 airfoil, aspect ratio 8.47 and taper ratio 0.72, (5) 
Wing area: 1.53 m2, (6) Push Engine: 2 stroke 157 cc gasoline, 3000~5800 rpm, double blade 
30x12 propeller, (7) Structure fuel tank: 13 liters, (8) Power generator, DC 12V/160W @ 
4000 rpm, with DC/DC converters and redundant Li battery, (9) Feasible mission time: 6 hr, 
(10) Full composite material.  
From the design consideration, the cabin is 38Hx28Wx130L cm in dimension to get 
actual useful space of 97 liters.  It is large enough for different mission payloads.  But this 
fuselage results in relatively larger drag to flight performance.  The engine should be 
upgraded from the calculated scale of 100 cc into 122 cc or 157 cc to offer over thrust to 
overcome the high drag and to suit for poor weather operation.  Finally, a  157 cc engine by 
3W is selected.  Cardinal 71 UAV is shown in Figure 1.

redundant data links for control command uplink and flight data down link.  In the initial 
phase in the plain area, 3G communication has much better QoS than 900 MHz [6].   
 
 
Figure 3: Ground computer interface for real time monitoring. 
 
To determine the UAV dynamic motion in missions, the ground control center on a 
laptop computer is set up to receive downlink messages and uplink flight control commands.  
The navigation waypoints for each mission are uplinked onto the airborne computer through 
900MHz and 3G systems, and displayed on the ground computer interface as shown in Fig. 3. 
The flight information is obtained by GPS for X and Y coordinates, by IMU for attitude 
and by ADU for TAS and MSL. The airborne computer receives navigation waypoints of X 
and Y coordinates as well as the terrain altitudes H for each mission. The flight control 
follows the waypoints and current UAV position to calculate the headings and altitudes for 
the longitudinal and lateral mode autopilot control to operator actuators.  
The ground computer interface contains:  
 For real time operation: (1) The “PAPAGO” GIS is used for flight monitoring from GPS 
downlinks. (2) The airborne computer accepts 10 navigation waypoints for each segment of 
the mission with X, Y coordinate shown in the left window. (3) The new navigation 
waypoints can be uploaded before the mission route is completed by the next 10 navigation 
waypoints from the ground computer.  
 For flight information display: (1) UAV downlinks messages are displayed in the left 
lower window for UTC, X, Y, Speed, azimuth, distance and heading angle to the next 
navigation waypoint. (2) All messages are stored in the airborne computer for analysis.

where PR is the pseudo range of the receiver, C is the speed of light, dτs is time error of 
satellite, dτr is the time error of receiver, ρ is the distance between satellite (subscript s) and 
receiver (subscript r), ε is the multipath error. The targets or waypoints are fixed GPS data 
from digital map and the location of UAV is real time data from airborne GPS.  Its heading 
angle needs to update instantly to correct the environment effects from wind, temperature, 
and others.  Airborne computer reads the corrected heading in 2 Hz, but outputs the flight 
control command in 1 Hz.  This calculation determines UAV flight heading, and its altitude 
(Z) is maintained 300 feet above the next waypoint terrain height.  
 
 
 
 
Two methods are used for waypoint approaching assessment by (a) the error radius check, 
and (b) the vector analysis check, as shown in Figure 7, for 
(a) , (b) , 
where Dd is the assumed target radius, d is the distance from the intersection point to target.

2.6 QNH correction ADU 
The ADU includes pitot pressure and static pressure using a MS5540 pressure sensor, as 
shown in Figure 11, and a temperature sensor DS-1812.  Pitot pressure is converted into true 
airspeed for Cardinal flight control, and the airspeed is calibrated in laboratory.  MEMS 
sensor data are compared with GPS data to avoid drift errors.  The flight control receives 
12 
 
collision. 
 
2.7 Communication system 
The communication system includes 900MHz for wide range two-way flight control, 2.4 
GHz for video downlink, and 3G mobile communication for uplink commands/downlink 
flight surveillance [6].  Since academic research is not permitted with high power 
communication to cover wide range operation, all available VHF/UHF resources have 
coverage limit by environment interference to result in capability deficiency.  In Taiwan, 2.5 
G, 3G and 3.5G mobile communications have very wide coverage and good QoS [6]. Thus 
mobile communication is used as a redundant system to continuously receive flight operation 
up/downlink data. Figure 13 shows the antenna arrangement at the bottom of the Cardinal 
cabin.  On the top, there are antenna modules for GPS and mobile communication, and the 
RF controller antenna is stretched out on the wing.  
 
Figure 13: Antenna arrangement at the bottom. 
 
 
2.8 Camera payloads 
Two camera sets are installed on the Cardinal 71 for surveillance photo acquisition.  
The front camera has a wide angle lens heading 5 degrees forward, as shown in Figure 14.  
The second lens is a high resolution tele-camera with fast zooming mechanics in the main 
cabin. The zooming mechanics control takes 0.5~1 second to switch from normal lens into 25 
time tele-focus lens. It is used to capture high resolution images whenever the wide angle 
camera captures scene of need.  In the surveillance mission, the tele-focus lens is switched 
into continuous target image acquisition.

3.2 Data downlinks 
Figure 16 shows the GPS trajectory downlink via 3G mobile communication and 900 
MHz UHF communication.  The data downlink was severely influenced by the 900 MHz 
system for its omni-antenna and ground obstacles; whereas the 3G mobile system captures 
almost 98% data.  But these two data downlinks are redundant to each other in the Cardinal 
UAV system. After using the ground antenna tracking, the data downlink through 900 MHz 
and 2.4 GHz is much improved.

3.3 IMU data 
Flight performance data are captured from airborne computer and stored in the airborne 
computer for further analysis. The first phase tests establish real time data for further 
autopilot flight control.  Figure 17 shows the Euler angles of roll, pitch and yaw from IMU. 
The pitot speed and GPS are captured simultaneously and are compared in Figure 18.  In the 
autopilot flight control system, a minimum level flight speed will be calibrated as a constraint 
to avoid stall.   
In the Cardinal system, the QNH corrected MSL altitude will be obtained in contract for 
better accuracy to avoid terrain collision.  The comparison of GPS altitude to QNH 
corrected pressure altitude is show in Figure 19.  With additional tests, the low altitude error 
can be corrected within 10 meters.  This result is sufficient for Cardinal operation in our 
terrain critical missions.

Figure 20: Autopilot flight control implementation. 
 
When the autopilot is activated, the airborne computer will seek for the nearest 
waypoints that have been uplinked from the ground control computer on the memory.  Each 
waypoint will be “flying-by” following the proposed approaching control algorithm.  The 
approach contour is not exactly over the assigned waypoint coordinate as shown in Figure 21.

3.5 Video surveillance tests 
The flight mission is tested with heading wide angle camera downlink to ground 
computer via two communication links.  Using low resolution web-cam, the video image is 
sent over Internet via 3G mobile and displayed on Skype network, as shown in Figure 22.  
However, 3G mobile cannot offer well coverage in the remote area.  In far range test, 2.4 
GHz or 900MHz should be viable for good quality video downlink.  When the ground 
antenna tracking mechanism has been established, the video down link has been extended 
into 25 km from the second phase flight tests under good weather condition.

3.7 Environment monitor 
The Cardinal UAV can be applied for homeland security on bridge and its riverbed 
watch for disaster prevention near main bridges.  Figure 25 shows a zoo-in photo taken for 
riverbed changes using periodic image acquisition by continuous riverbed monitoring. Since 
the exact photo spots are difficult to identify, the Cardinal UAV takes photos on several back 
and forth flights above the target area.  
 
Figure 25: Riverbed watch in successive photos. 
 
3.8 Mission planning  
The Cardinal system is designed for missions of disaster surveillance and rescue search.  
A mission path plan is defined on a digital map as Mission 1 in Figure 3. The path plan is 
constructed with several navigation waypoints toward the target.  Each waypoint will be 
determined by X and Y coordinates with their published altitudes for reference.  During 
flight approach by GPS navigation, waypoint altitude is critical in autopilot to keep UAV 
from terrain obstruction.   
20 
 
waypoints in MSL, and also considers a 1000 feet corridor wide path between waypoints. The 
mission plan determines a 3D flight contour from 3D waypoint data to avoid terrain collision.  
The autopilot flight control reads the ADU altitude and compares that with the waypoint 
altitude to determine the minimum operating altitude between two waypoints, and commands 
pitch control to the constrained height.  A 3D flight contour is constructed, as shown in 
Figure 28, to read into the airborne computer for navigation and control. When Ce-71 
approaches to the target, it reduces speed and altitude so it can start its cameras to capture 
photos by pre-scheduled performance.

4. Conclusion 
The Cardinal UAV system has been developed with series of flight tests with different 
payloads in low altitude.  The Cardinal UAV family contains Ce-71 of the preliminary one, 
Ce-72 with control surface modification, Ce-73 with long haul capability.  From near 12 
month test, most functions have been verified to fulfill its design specifications.   
The path planning and the ground computer interface are very flexible design for 
mission assignment and flight operation in autopilot.  There is a limit to upload 10 
navigation waypoints at one time and can be reloaded easily by 3G communication.  The 
tests verify that 3G mobile communication is very reliable to communicate between the UAV 
and the ground computer. Especially when the ground antenna tracking is installed, 3G plays 
important redundant support to 900 MHz system.  The proposed QNH barometric altitude 
correction does really help the flight control operation according to each path plan.  It is 
especially useful and important to mountainous flight missions.  
Cameras are the most important payload on the Cardinal system. In our demonstration,

by five components of fuzzification, knowledge base, rule base, fuzzy Inference engine, and 
defuzzification as shown in Figure 1. 
 
Knowledge base Rule base
Fuzzy Inference

Figure 1: The composition of fuzzy controller. 
 
The input variables of fuzzy controller must be fuzzifized to fit into fuzzy rules. The role 
of fuzzfication is to convert a value of real signal called crisp to a fuzzy set. Assume a fuzzy 
input variable error “e” ,  the fuzzy set can be expressed as:  
e = {NB, NM, NS, ZO, PS, PM, PB}, 
where NB represents negative big, NM represents negative medium, and NS represents 
negative small, and so on. The knowledge base is constructed by membership functions 
which are formed by fuzzy sets. 
The rule base stores fuzzy rules. [If – Then] is the most common sentence used to 
describe fuzzy rules. For example, we assume there are two input variables and one output 
variable. “e” is error, “ec” is change of error, and “u” is output control value. Following 
sentences are some of fuzzy rule descriptions:  
Rule 1: if e is NB and ec is NB then u is PB, 
Rule 2: if e is NB and ec is NS then u is PM. 
Fuzzy Inference engine uses the fuzzy rules to reason for the fuzzy output. In this thesis, we 
adopt Mamdani-type [Max – min synthesis] to be the fuzzy rules [1, 2, 3]. 
The defuzzification strategy is the center of gravity (COG) method [14, 15] as:  
ݑ଴ ൌ ∑௫೔·ఓሺ௫೔ሻ∑ఓሺ௫೔ሻ           (2-1) 
To create a fuzzy logic controller, the first step is to choose the structure of FLC. The 
two-dimensional FLC of which input variables are “error” and differential of “error” is the 
most common FLC to be used in this thesis. 
The second step specifies the active ranges of different output variables, and describes 
the use of fuzzy linguistic variables. The fuzzy sets designed for USV is described below:  
e = {NM, Z, PM}, ec = {NM, Z, PM}, u = {NM, Z, PM},  
where “e” stands for error in heading, “ec” stands for change of error in heading, and u 
stands for control value of rudder, and “NM” represents negative medium, “Z” represents 
  
multiplied by 6, then the maximum control value will become 30 degrees, and the minimum 
control value will be -30 degrees. 
The next step is to build the fuzzy control rule base. According to human thinking for 
inference, the trend of input variables is used as “e” and “ec”, to design the rule base of 
output variable “u”.  The input variables “e” and “ec” have three membership function sets 
individually.  There are 9 fuzzy rules by the following table to be adopted by USV.  
 
Table 1: The rule base. 
  
 
Figure 5: Rule surface of rudder control value. 
 
There are totally four output variables that need to be fuzzified in FLC design. They are: 
roll, pitch, heading error, and throttle. Roll and pitch are used to level the UAV. Heading 
error is used to adjust the heading of UAV. And throttle is used to control the height of UAV. 
To design the FLC for UAV, the range of each variable should be determined from the Ce-71 
UAV design specifications. 
All designs of membership functions in this thesis are based on the design specifications 
  
The navigation flowchart is illustrated in Figure 7.  According to literature [4, 5], when 
the UAV reaches waypoint, the error radius method is most used.  This is the most intuitive 
method for waypoint switching. But in order to prevent the program makes a mistake 
concerning waypoint switching, a method of vector analysis [6] has been adopted in this 
study. 
In Figure 8, Q stands for the past position, R stands for the present position, P stands for 
waypoint, COG stands for course over ground in degrees (0 to 360 degree), and Ψd stands 
for the angle of real heading correction (-180 to 180 degree). The following algorithm is the 
calculation of real heading correction: 
 
 
Figure 8: Real heading correction. 
 
There are two methods adopted in this thesis for waypoint switching. First one is error 
radius, and the second one is vector analysis.  In order to switch to the next waypoint, the 
requirement of the first method, error radius, is:  
 
where Dd stands for error radius. หPRሬሬሬሬሬറห stands for distance which is between USV/UAV and 
waypoint.  Figure 9 reveals the condition when USV/UAV passed through.

4. UAV System Verification 
The FLC flight control is implemented onto the UAV.  The tests are going to show the 
experiment flight data of UAV.  All the waypoints were set up relative to the start point. In 
other words, the start point is considered as the origin of the coordination. The positive 
direction of X-axis is east; the positive direction of Y-axis is north; the positive direction of

dotted line represents the end time of the autopilot mode. The top and the foot dotted lines 
represent the margin of error which is 30 meters. The middle dotted line represents the 
default target height. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Work 
The observation asserts that wind disturbance causes significant effect at the particular 
moment of FLC decision-making.  It is confirmed that waypoint searching by the proposal 
algorithm is successful both on slow speed USV and on fast speed UAV. 
From the tracks of UAV, we can find that although the parameters of FLC are maintained 
identical waypoints, the UAV changed its course after a few loops. The differences of tracks 
were caused by FLC.  By We suppose the wind let the UAV deviated from its original 
course, so the flight control system and FLC change its heading according to the heading 
correction (Ψd). The reason is that the FLC always trying to find the shortest and most 
suitable course. If the target is on the left side, FLC will try to search left side and vice versa. 
The result is shown in Figure 16.

  Abstract—
 
This paper presents an economic flight operation.  
Based on Flight Operation Quality Assurance (FOQA) system, 
flight performance database from local airline is used for 
analysis and assessment.  Considering the environment 
difference, there are various methods to estimate the 
operational fuel consumption by eight continuous flight stages.  
A correlation statistics is established to look into different 
affecting factors in significance to fuel saving.  The highly 
correlated non-operational factors, correlated operational 
factors are identified in different phases of flight operation. A 
medium range scheduled flight service operating by local airline 
between Taipei and Macau is raised as an example of study. 
From total real 2416 flight data, with appropriate flight 
operation, a feasible 6.77% fuel saving from RCTP to VMMC.

I. INTRODUCTION 
he air transportation system has experienced with fuel 
cost from 15% to 40% in the overall cost from 2001 to 
2009 [1].  The crude oil price varied triple in this decade that 
airlines suffered with serious revenue problem.  Under the 
surge of fuel prices, both airlines and aircraft manufacturers 
have paid very serious attention on reducing fuel 
consumption [2]. This issue impacts aircraft design and 
manufacture, as well as airline operation and management. 
Fuel conservation has become the major preoccupation for 
all airlines [3]. These dilemmas 
  Lin and Liu 
deepened the operating 
difficulties of airlines’ business [4].  
[3] described some key solution on fuel 
conservation in each flight mission. Aiming at the fact of 
many factors related to fuel and cost saving, the most direct 
link about fuel consumption is the flight operation itself.  
They focused on the flight operation analysis and control 
toward the fuel saving goals. It would need to find out some 
possible way to restrain the loss of high fuel prices on 
airlines

  The Flight Operation Quality Assurance (FOQA) 
system [5] is a systematic way to deal with flight 
performance. FOQA system is a mechanism which can 
record and analysis actual flight operational parameters, e.g., 
IAS, altitude, weight, and etc. to improve flight safety.  
Airlines with FOQA mechanism typically use a quick-access 
recorder (QAR) to record flight data onto a removable optical 
disk that facilitates. FOQA is a routine to download and 
systematically analyze of Digital Flight Data Recorder 
(DFDR) with threshold limit and safety margin from aircraft 
system parameters as described in Figure.  According to the 
aircraft manufacturers, there are some apparent impacts on 
each flight operations [2]. By making use of the actual flight 
operation data, the flight fuel saving strategy can be 
scheduled and conducted in the most effective way. 
  
      In the premise, the study is going to analyze the factors 
which affect fuel consumption and the influences to actual 
flight [6]. Their purpose was to examine the influence of 
flight operations on fuel conservation for providing 
recommendations to enhance fuel economy, based on the 
aircraft manufacturer data and their actual flight data [7].  
II. ANALYTICAL METHOD 
This study aims at construction on an economic fuel 
saving strategy using collected real flight performance data 
from Trans Asia Airline.  With FOQA aids, the flight 
performance database is established and processed for the 
proposed strategy and procedure for operation. Case study on 
a regional route from Taipei (RCTP) to Macau (VMMC) is 
presented on Airbus A-321 [8].  A-321 is a twin engine 
jetliner at 185 seating capacity with maximum takeoff weight 
(MTOW) at 93,500kg (206,000 lb) [9].  With plenty data 
support over 2416 flight data records.  By the proposed eight 
step operation and control strategies, 6.77% fuel saving can 
be accomplished.  It is valuable to airlines under crude oil 
price impacts.  
2.1 Correlation Analysis  
  The correlation statistics analysis uses statistical 
methods to calculate the cross relationship among multiple 
factors. 
 
Correlation factor is computed and expressed by the 
correlation coefficient, which has ranges between -1 and 
+1.  Perfect positive correlation, which has a correlation 
co-efficient of +1, implies that as one security factor moves 
either up or down, the other security will be in lockstep in the 
same direction.  Alternatively, a perfect negative correlation,

of climb are higher during climb.  All flights at headwind will 
operate at higher rate of climb than those at tailwind. 
According to the analysis results, the flights with different 
weight levels under headwind or tailwind, there are 
appropriate rate of climb to select for fuel saving.  The 
aircraft does not operate at lower rate of climb at higher 
airspeed.

  The operation in climb, cruise and descent phases is 
mutually influenced to each other.
  To save fuel, it is recommended that: (1) the aircraft in L 
level, either in headwind or tailwind, can select the higher 
rate of climb than average value; (2) and H, M level when 
meet tailwind can select the higher rate of climb than average 
value, and just maintain the average rate of climb at 
headwind.  
  In the headwind condition, 
the flights with weigh level M and L will get faster to climb 
into the cruise level. Although they can save fuel at climb 
phase, but when they climb to cruise level, they will consume 
more fuel than other flights. 
  Another way to minimize overall fuel consumption 
during flight, a low cost index must be used [3].  As the climb 
phase is the most fuel consuming, it is advantageous to 
minimize climb duration by setting at the maximum rate of 
climb speed.  
  Short flight usually spends less time, to avoid burn off 
too much fuel in the climb phase, it is proposed to select CI=0. 
For long distance flights, it is recommended to climb to the 
cruising level as soon as possible, it is recommended to 
choose CI = CImax
  
 [3]. 
3.5 Fuel Consumption Analysis—Cruise 
  Cruise phase spends the most time in the entire flight 
and also burns about 31.60% of the overall fuel consumption.  
For more accurate analysis, the fuel burn data of cruise phase 
will be separated into 6 different parts by wind direction and 
take-off weight.  
  The results show that different wind direction will not 
affect the setting of air speed in certain degree.  But the 
heavier the flight, the faster air speed is selected.  At the same 
time, despite flight weight level, the fuel consumption is 
definitely increased with faster air speed.  But low air speed 
will devalue the fuel efficiency. It is therefore recommended 
that the aircraft in cruise phase, the airspeed should be 260 
knots of 5 knots below the average.  It takes 30 more seconds 
than use average airspeed to fly, but gains 2~3% fuel saving.  
Using the correlation analysis, the results 
are correlation parameters of “air speed”, “angle of 
elevation” and “cruise level” to the overall fuel consumption.  
  From statistics, the wind direction is not the factor 
affected aircraft’s elevation setting. The main factor to affect 
the setting on angle of elevation is the aircraft weight. 
Because the heavier aircraft needs more lift at the same cruise 
speed, the only way to increase lift should be the angle of 
elevation from aerodynamic performance.  
  From the database, the cruise altitude of aircraft is 
distributed over 30,000 to 39,000 feet.  According to the 
weight bracket to distinguish these data, the weight level L is 
the lighter in the brackets.  It is the maximum cruising 
altitude with the lowest rate of fuel consumption.  For the 
weight level M and H, although theirs cruise altitude is lower 
than L level, it can find a suitable cruise altitude to 
 
lower fuel 
consumption from its fuel consumption trend analysis.  It is 
recommended when the weight is L level, the cruise altitude 
can set to higher than 36,000 feet; when the weight bracket is 
H and M.  It is proposed to set the cruise altitude between 
33,000 to 34,000 feet.  They are resulted in Tables 7 and 8.

Table 13 shows that, compared to taxi-out, the fuel 
consumption for taxi-in is lower.  In RCTP, the distance of 
runway 23 is longer than runway 05.  But the speed when 
landing to runway 23 is higher that can lower fuel 
consumption.  In VMMC, the distance of runway 34 is longer 
than runway 16. But the speed when landing to runway 34 is 
also higher that can lower fuel consumption. 
  According to correlation analysis, “taxiing speed 
(TGS)” is the operating factor that affects the fuel 
consumption in this phase. The result shows that when the 
aircraft encounters larger wind speed in taxiing, the ground 
taxiing speed will be faster and can lower fuel consumption.  
It is recommended that when aircraft taxis in to the gate, the 
taxiing speed should be increase to high standard to reduce 
the fuel consumption.

V. CONCLUSION 
  In this paper, many aspects of fuel saving operation 
have been discussed including flight planning and flight 
operations. The objective of this study is mainly focused on 
fuel consumption impact of the largest non-operating factors 
and operating factors.  In fact, many other factors affecting 
the fuel consumption are worthy of exploration to improve 
the fuel efficiency, particularly in the high oil price era.  
However, some actions on fuel saving may threat flight 
safety.  It is the negative part of fuel conservation in flight 
piloting. 
  From the analysis results in Table 15, a feasible 6.77% 
fuel reduction from some useful pilot operations can be 
achieved.  However, pilot operation cannot always consider 
fuel saving to sacrifice flight safety.  As earlier study [3] by 
Captain Liu, the operation control skill needs to completely 
understand the basic aerodynamics with frequent practice 
and quick flight situation awareness. The proposed fuel 
reduction analysis offers only a recommendation to pilots 
and dispatchers for flight operation and flight planning.  This 
study has concluded that fuel saving can definitely be 
accomplished through pilot operations.   
  In the study, a regional medium range flight with actual 
flight data is used to discover the possible chance of flight 
operation in burning less fuel.  After analyzing the flight data 
and deriving those results, some results are concluded from 
the complex flight operation matters.

II. THERMOELECTRIC CONVERSION 
The thermoelectric conversion follows three 
fundamental effects as: Seebeck Effect, Peltier Effect and 
Thomson Effect.  Seebeck Effect explained the thermal 
coupler structure by combined joint of two specific metals. 
Two junction points at two different temperatures will 
generate closed loop current, or generate observable open 
loop voltage.  Either current or voltage is proportional to the 
temperature difference of two junction points.  Peliter Effect 
was a reverse operation of bi-metal material by applying 
current into the circuit to generate hot junction point and cold 
junction point.  Cold junction point absorbs heat actuating as 
thermoelectric refrigeration; while the hot junction point 
releases heat energy as a heat pump.  Thomson Effect 
explores current flowing through temperature gradient 
materials from cold to hot, the material will absorb heat; and 
vice versa.  These three effects can be expressed 
mathematically as follows [2, 11].

The thermoelectric module is composed of several 
thermo-couplers.  The structure of an ideal thermo-coupler is 
explained as Figure 1 [10, 12].  It is composed of P and N 
electrodes of thermoelectric materials and connecting to 
conductors.  Heat dissipates from heat source via conductor B 
through N and P electrodes to conductors A and C.  Larger 
thermoelectric module can be connected of plenty thermal 
couplers in series.

conversion.  
 
In general, the thermo-couplers have different 
connections: 
(1) Referring to Figure 1, if a voltage is applied across 
A and C, the current will flow through the thermo-coupler.  
According to Peltier Effect, the direction of current flow 
determines the thermo-coupler to be a heat pump or a 
thermoelectric refrigerator.  
(2) When the thermo-coupler junction points (B-A or 
B-C) are maintained with a fixed temperature difference 
(Δ=Th-Tc), by introducing a load resistance RL

From the formulations, the internal resistance of the 
thermoelectric module is a function of temperature, some 
range should be required. For the results of this evaluation on 
HZ-20 heat converter, its load resistance lies between 0.25 Ω 
and 0.35 Ω. 
HZ-20 performance requires an optimum temperature 
difference under design conditions of 200℃ to get its internal 
resistance about 0.3±0.05Ω.  In the system design, the chosen 
load resistance for testing can be 0.3Ω.   
In additional to circuit connection, the mechanical 
contact pressure between thermoelectric module and heat 
source is a critical condition of concern.

IV. THERMOELECTRIC SYSTEM OPERATION 
Based on the experimental system setup, the 
thermoelectric conversion system has generated electric 
power from each HZ-20.  The heat source offers a total of 
4000 W energy radiation from the center of the aluminum 
heat spreader of the test platform.  The temperature reference 
of test platform is controlled by a heat controller to maintain 
at 300° C on the aluminum surface of heat spreader of the test 
platform.  
Figure 8 shows the test results of the top HZ-20.  The 
X-axis represents the temperature difference between on the 
hot side and cold side of the HZ-20 thermoelectric module; 
while three Y-axes are the module output voltage, current and 
electric power, respectively.

energy conservation.  Due to heat dissipation property and 
mechanical structure characteristics, the proposed 
experimental system for heat recovery has made some 
considerations to achieve the successful result.   
The following critical constraints should be fulfilled in 
system construction features. (1) Pressure: A strong spring 
with rigid structure is built to hold the fasten screw to 
pressurize between heat spreader, HZ-20 and heat sink for 
better contact. The best way should apply the pressurized 
force from the central area of the thermoelectric module. (2) 
Heat sink: The hot side of thermoelectric module is designed 
at a temperature of 230°C but cold side design at temperature 
of 30°C, the optimal temperature difference between cold 
side and hot side is designed at 200°C.  In the experiment 
system, the temperature difference is 200° C for the hot side 
255° C but 55℃ at cold side. The heat sink needs to improve 
its water ventilation. (3) Cooling water: An open-loop 
cooling water supply should be designed from a higher water 
tower for free-running ventilation. The throughput water is 
plenty to supply about from 0.5 to 1 liter per minute from 
each HZ-20 module.  Cooling water flow rate is controlled by 
microprocessor with overall performance index.  In the 
experimental system, the temperature rise of the cooling 
water from inlet to outlet is about 30 ~ 40 °C.  The inlet fresh 
cooling water can be controlled at 20 ~ 25 °C to supply at 
least 55 °C warm water at outlet, and may be post-heated up 
to 70 ~ 80 ° C by extending the pipe loop attaching to the hot 
wall.  The hot water becomes a by-product for further 
applications.  
From electric measurements, the each individual module 
has different level of voltage and current.  While the TEGs are 
connected in series for higher voltage output, the stack up 
circuit is not linear summation.  However, from experiments, 
the simple demonstration DC/DC converter has achieved a 
practical power supply from TEG system.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
Energy conservation leads the idea of waste heat 
recovery study.  Many projects have been carried out to create 
some experiment methods to verify the feasibility design and 
assess its value and effectiveness.  From the experiment 
system in this paper, a total power balance gets a gain of 
actual benefit from such kind of thermoelectric conversion.  
Since HZ-20 is designed as 5% thermo-electric conversion 
efficiency, the experiment system verifies a positive 
economic gain can be accomplished from a delicate waste 
heat conversion system design.  
From the experiments, the waste heat recovery is a serious 
subject to study. From the cost benefit evaluation, the 
generated electric power and hot water can be valuable 
products in implementation.   
In conclusion, the waste heat recovery project in this 
paper has accomplished and verified a positive economic 
benefit in the thermo-electric conversion project.  As long as 
the system constraints can carefully meet, the performance of 
positive electric power economic can be achieved. The results 
lead an optimistic and valuable future perspective in real 
world applications.
