Abstract 
An optical programming/electrical erasing memory device was fabricated by adopting organic 
thin film transistors incorporating core/shell CdSe@ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) and 
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as active layers. After illumination, the presence of quantum 
well-structured core/shell CdSe@ZnSe QDs within the P3HT film enhanced the maximum 
ON/OFF ratio substantially to 2700; this value was maintained for 8000 s without noticeable 
decay. The ON state current could be erased effectively when using a single pulse of the gate 
voltage (-10 V). This fabrication approach opens up the possibility of improving the memory 
performance of polymeric materials prepared at low cost using simple processes.

1. Introduction 
The development of conjugated polymers 
for use in organic optoelectronic devices is an 
area of intense investigation.Several research 
groups have recently reported the 
photoresponse and memory functions of 
organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) [1-9]. One 
such early device took advantage of the 
illumination of poly(3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT) 
with light at a wavelength of 632.8 nm to create 
electric charges that were later trapped at the 
polymer–dielectric interface [1]; this system 
featured an ON/OFF ratio of ca. 30 for the 
memory window at a gate voltage (VGS) of 60 
V under a light intensity of 70 mW/cm2. This 
device exhibited a loss of 70% in its drain 
current and a short retention time after turning 
the light off. An alternative approach involves 
the use of conjugated polymers or quantum 
dots (QDs) as photosensitive materials along 
with carbon nanotube (CNT)-based field effect 
transistors for the fabrication of optoelectronic 
memory devices that function through optical 
programming and electrical erasing.One such 
 4
addition of TOPO (2.5 mg) and HDA (1.5 mg), 
the mixture was heated at ca. 190 ºC to 
completely remove the heptane. Zinc stearate 
(316 mg) was dissolved in toluene (2.5 ml) at 
ca. 60 ºC. After cooling to room temperature, 
the resulting 0.2 M solution was mixed with 
TOP (2.5 ml) and Se (39.48 mg). This mixture 
was injected via syringe pump (0.085 ml/min) 
into the reaction flask containing the CdSe QDs 
at ca. 190 ºC. After the addition was complete, 
the crystals were annealed at 190 ºC for an 
additional 1 h. The CdSe@ZnSe QDs were 
collected as powders after their precipitation 
with MeOH. 
 
2.2. Device fabrication and measurement 
 
A solution of P3HT in CHCl3 was blended 
with a solution of the QDs in CHCl3; the 
P3HT/QD composite weight ratio was 1:0.1. 
The P3HT and P3HT/QD TFT devices were 
fabricated in a bottom-gate configuration. An 
n+ silicon wafer (<0.005 Ω cm) was used as the 
substrate and gate; 900-Å thermal SiO2 
(capacitance: 38.4 nF/cm2) was the gate 
insulator; a photolithographically patterned 
Au/Cr layer (thickness: 600/50 Å) functioned 
as the source and drain electrodes (W= 1000 
μm; L = 10 μm). Octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) 
was deposited by immersing the substrate in 1 
mM heptane solution for 10 min; the substrates 
were rinsed with heptane and isopropanol, 
followed by drying with N2. The P3HT and 
P3HT/QD films (thickness: ca.60 nm) were 
deposited through spin-coating and then they 
were annealed at 150 ºC for 5 min inside a 
glove box under N2 atmosphere. The samples 
were then transferred to a cryogenic probe 
station (VFTTP4, Lakeshore). The performance 
of each device was measured under vacuum 
(<1 × 10-5 torr) in the dark using a Hewlett–
Packard 4156C semiconductor parameter 
analyzer. The devices were illuminated under 
vacuum using a tungsten halogen lamp (2.75 
mW/cm2). 
 
2.3. Characterization 
 
TEM images were obtained using an FEI 
Tecnai Spirit TWIN apparatus operated at 120 
keV. For TEM analysis, the devices were 
placed into 1% HF solution; after the active 
layers had floated to the solution surface, they 
were transferred to the TEM grid. A Hitachi 
U-4100 spectrophotometer was used to obtain 
optical absorption spectroscopy in the UV–vis 
range; a Hitachi F-4500 FL spectrophotometer 
was employed to obtain photoluminescence 
spectra. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
To discern the effect that the ligands on 
the QDs had on the performance of the 
memory devices, we investigated 
trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) as the 
ligand because TOPO-capped CdSe QDs 
feature large barriers that prevent electron 
tunneling into P3HT and better dispersion 
than pyridine-capped CdSe QDs in P3HT 
(see Fig. S1, Supplementary material). 
Fig. 1a presents the UV–vis and 
photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdSe and 
CdSe@ZnSe QDs that we prepared from the 
same concentrations in toluene. The first 
excitonic absorption peak of the CdSe QDs 
appeared at ca. 540 nm, suggesting an 
average particle size of ca.2.85 nm [20], 
which is consistent with the dimensions 
obtained from transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) image analyses. The 
presence of the ZnSe shell caused a red shift 
in the absorption spectrum and enhanced the 
PL intensity.  
Fig. 1b displays a schematic energy level 
diagram of the CdSe and ZnSe bulk 
materials, P3HT, and Au electrodes [21,22]. 
Because the lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied 
molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT lie 
above the conduction band (CB) and valance 
band (VB) edges of the CdSe and ZnSe 
materials, respectively, the P3HT–ZnSe 
interface forms an offset band 
heterojunction; in contrast, the CdSe core 
and ZnSe shell form a type-I heterojunction. 
When illuminated, excitons were generated 
in the QDs and P3HT, charge separation 
occurred at the P3HT–QDs interface, and 
 6
and P3HT/CdSe@ZnSe devices at values of 
VDS and VGS of -20 and 5 V, respectively, 
after they were subject to a light of 2.75 
mW/cm2 with a duration of 100 s. At the 
onset of illumination, the drain current of 
both the P3HT/CdSe and 
P3HT/CdSe@ZnSedevices increased 
dramatically, and then dropped off to form 
plateaus when light is turned off. After the 
light had been turned off for 400 s, the drain 
current of the P3HT/CdSe@ZnSe device had 
decreased by 14%, compared with a 
corresponding loss of 60% for the 
P3HT/CdSe device. We suspect that the 
mechanism underlying this behaviors 
involved two relaxation processes: (i) rapid 
decay corresponding to the recombination of 
closely spaced charge carriers and (ii) slow 
decay resulting from the recombination of 
well-separated carriers [27] (Fig. 3b). The 
slow decay might be manifested by the fact 
that, in a heterojunction device, the spatially 
separated holes and electrons will move 
differently-the holes drifting toward the 
channel and then reaching the drain 
electrode, the electrons mostly confined in 
the QDs and at the P3HT-SiO2 interface. 
After the light was turned off, the devices 
existed in a non-equilibrium state; some of 
the photogenerated holes presumably 
recombined with some residual electrons that 
were not confined in QDs, causing a 
reduction in the drain current,eventually 
reaching a metastable state. Because the 
coverage of the CdSe QDs surfaces by 
TOPO was only ca.55% [21], the ZnSe shell 
layer between the CdSe core and the P3HT 
polymer in the P3HT/CdSe@ZnSe devices 
resulted in an additional tunneling barrier 
that prevented the electrons from tunneling 
back to P3HT, leading to a smaller decrease 
in the drain current and a larger retention 
time relative to those of the CdSe QDs 
devices, as indicated by the slope of the 
drain currents at 600 s.  
Because low power consumption is an 
important feature for non-volatile memory 
applications, it is preferable to operate 
optoelectronic memory devices in the 
absence of a gate voltage. Fig. 3c displays 
the evolution of the normalized drain 
currents at values of VDS and VGS of -20 and 
0 V, respectively, for the devices subjected 
to a light of 2.75 mW/cm2 with a duration of 
100 s. After turning off the light, the 
P3HT/CdSe@ZnSe and P3HT/CdSe devices 
exhibited losses of 8 and 35%, respectively, 
of their ON state currents, with ON/OFF 
ratios of 36 and 1.5, respectively. Therefore, 
we conclude that Type-I heterojunction 
core/shell QDs are more suitable than 
homogenous QDs for memory applications 
both with and without applied gate voltages.   
Fig. 4 presents TEM images of the CdSe 
and CdSe@ZnSe QDs dispersed in the P3HT 
matrix at a P3HT-to-QD weight ratio of 
1:0.1. The bright appearance of the P3HT 
regions relative to dark QD regions in the 
contrast image was probably due to the large 
difference in their respective electron 
densities. The CdSe QDs were distributed 
rather homogenously in the P3HT matrix; we 
suspect that the lower homogeneity of the 
P3HT/CdSe@ZnSe film was due to a loss of 
TOPO coverage during the growth of the 
shell. The TEM images in the insets to Fig. 4 
reveal that the CdSe and CdSe@ZnSe QDs 
had average sizes of ca. 2.9 and 4.3 nm, 
respectively. The ZnSe shell thickness was 
ca. 0.7 nm, i.e., slightly larger than the 
critical penetration length of electrons (ca. 
0.5 nm) [21].  
To determine the optimal operating 
conditions, we fabricated 10 devices from 
three independently prepared 
P3HT/CdSe@ZnSe films; the optimal 
ON/OFF ratio was greater than 1000 at a 
value of VGS of 10 V. Fig. 5 reveals that the 
P3HT/CdSe@ZnSe devices exhibited a high 
ON/OFF ratio of 2700 at a value of VGS of 
10 V-without any noticeable decay after the 
light had been turned off for 8000 s. This 
result indicates that incorporating core/shell 
QDs into a conjugated polymer significantly 
extends the lifetime of the memory states of 
the resulting polymer TFTs. Moreover, the 
inset to Fig. 5 also displays the dynamic 
responses of the optical programming and 
electrical erasing of the P3HT/CdSe@ZnSe 
device. The ON state current could be erased

Abstract 
This paper describes the optical responses and memory effects of poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT/ 
CdSe quantum dot (QD) thin-film transistors (TFTs). TFTs incorporating P3HT/CdSe QD blends 
as the active layer exhibited higher photocurrents than did the corresponding P3HT-only devices 
because the heterojunction between P3HT and the CdSe QDs enhanced the separation of excitons. 
Moreover, the CdSe QDs served as trap centers so that the memory effect was maintained for 
several hours, even when the device was operated without a gating voltage. Here, we demonstrate 
the potential applicability of such P3HT/CdSe QD TFTs through repeated optical programming 
and electrical erasing.

1. Introduction 
During the past few years, a tremendous 
amount of effort has been devoted to studies of 
polymer-based optoelectronic devices. The use 
of polymer memory has several advantages, 
including ease of fabrication and low cost. 
Many research teams are actively pursuing 
polymer phototransistors,but few are focusing 
on memory effects in the polymer devices, 
especially for polymer devices operated using 
optical programming and electrical erasing. A 
simple optically writeable memory device 
incorporating poly(alkylthiophene) as the 
active layer has been proposed, with the 
optically induced charge being trapped at the 
polymer-dielectric interface.1 Carbon nanotube 
networks have also been coated with polymers 
to form optoelectronic memory devices that are 
written optically and read and erased 
electrically, but these blended polymer/carbon 
nanotube devices lost their memory capability 
because the carbon nanotubes separated from 
the substrate and because the nanotube bundles 
contained metallic nanotubes.2 In 
polymer-based memory devices, the dynamic 
switch phenomenon depends strongly on the 
gate effect.3 The “on” state can be returned to 
the “off” state by removing the gate voltage.4 
Unfortunately, the on states of these devices 
were not maintained for very long in the 
 14
separation. The transmission electron 
microscopy image of the blend film (not shown 
here) revealed that the CdSe QDs had 
unexpectedly aggregated into clusters. To avoid 
aggregation of the CdSe QDs, a suitable ligand 
must be used to passivate the QDs to enhance 
the performance of the memory devices.  
We observed photoconductivity and the 
photovoltaic effect in the active layer of the 
transistors upon illumination.11 We attribute the 
significant increase in the drain current in the 
off state, when the device was being 
illuminated, to the enhancement of the drain 
current caused by the excitons in the polymer 
and nanocrystal. When illuminated, the 
excitons were generated in the CdSe QDs and 
P3HT. The electrons and holes eventually 
separated as a result of the electrical field. The 
drain currents of the P3HT/CdSe devices were 
larger than those of the P3HT-only devices 
because of the built-in field present at the 
P3HT-CdSe interface. The photoexcitation hole 
density within the thin film also contributed to 
the drain current and increased the threshold 
voltage to a large positive value.  
Threshold voltages (Vth) were determined 
from the intercepts of the √IDS-VGS plot. In 
general, the values of Vth of the blend 
P3HT/CdSe devices shifted to more-positive 
values, indicating the existence of a permanent 
electric field at the interface. The IDS-VGS curve 
shifted toward a positive voltage under 
illumination. As shown in Fig. 2, the value of 
Vth of the P3HT/CdSe device shifted to 10.0 V 
(illuminated) from 4.2 V (darkness), i.e., Δ
Vth=5.8 V. In contrast, the value of ΔVth of the 
P3HT-only device was ~1.9 V. The Δ Vth 
extracted from the backward sweep curve is 
more pronounced than that extracted from the 
forward sweep. For the forward sweep, when 
an initial negative gate voltage is applied, the 
trapped electrons in the P3HT/SiO2 interface 
and CdSe QDs would easily detrap and 
recombine with the hole in P3HT, leading to a 
reduction in the carrier density. Whereas, the 
recombination process of electrons and holes in 
backward sweep took place in the region that is 
not concerned with the memory functionality. 
The increase in the value of the carrier 
density N* in the active layer could be 
estimated using the equation N*=Ci Δ Vth/e, 
where Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the 
dielectric layer, Δ Vth is the shift of the 
threshold voltage, and e is the elementary 
charge. The values of N* of the P3HT/CdSe 
device and the P3HT-only device were ~1.39 
×1012 /cm2 and ~4.53×1011 /cm2, respectively, 
indicating that the P3HT/CdSe devices were 
more efficient at separating excitons, 
presumably because of the heterojunction at the 
P3HT-CdSe interface in the active layer. 
Upon sweeping the voltage from positive to 
negative and then back to positive, we observed 
obvious hysteresis under illumination, but 
indistinct hysteresis in the dark (Fig. 2).This 
behavior was a consequence of the trapped 
charges present at the polymer-dielectric 
interface or in the dielectric material. The 
hysteresis for a P3HT device was typically less 
than 1.1 V. For the P3HT/CdSe devices, it was 
~0.8 V. These similar values indicate a very 
small difference in their interface trap densities. 
The manifest hysteresis under illumination has 
also been observed in P3HT/PCBM 
phototransistors and organic capacitors.10,12 
Apparent hysteresis occurred upon illumination 
as a result of an increased number of carriers in 
the active layer becoming easily trapped, either 
at the P3HT-SiO2 interface or in SiO2 itself. In 
the P3HT/CdSe devices, some of the carriers 
were trapped in the CdSe QDs, resulting in the 
reduced degree of hysteresis. 
Hysteresis in the illuminated devices resulted 
from trapped electrons. When applied a 
positive gate voltage of 7.5 V (where the 
hysteresis is most pronounced in the Fig.2), Fig. 
3(a) indicates that the current in the P3HT-only 
devices reached a metastable state after turning 
off the pulse light source (30 s). This behavior 
is consistent with previous observations.1–3 
Trapping of electrons in SiO2 or at the 
P3HT-SiO2 interface screened the back-gate 
potential, resulting in the metastable state. We 
attribute the slow current decay to bulk 
recombination, which is an indication of the 
slow nonexponential relaxation process 
inherent to polymer-based devices. After 
turning off the light source, the drain current 
decayed rapidly when the gate voltage was 
equal to zero. The current moved back to the

1. Introduction 
Modulation of charge carrier dynamics for 
semiconductors is important to the 
development of light-energy conversion 
systems.1 In general, the fast recombination of 
charge carriers in semiconductors would 
diminish the resulting photoelectric conversion 
efficiency. To effectively gain energy from light, 
the photoexcited electrons and holes of 
semiconductors must be separated to suppress 
the direct recombination of them. Previous 
studies have shown that charge separation of 
semiconductors can be essentially promoted 
through the introduction of suitable electron 
acceptors, such as metals,2 carbon derivatives,3 
and other semiconductors with appropriate 
band structures.4 By adopting these composite 
systems, a significant enhancement in the 
photoconversion efficiency can be attained. For 
example, CdSe quantum dots can show 2-3 
orders of magnitude improvement in 
photocurrent generation once they were capped 
with a molecular shell of C60.3a This is due to 
the sufficiently positive reduction potential of 
C60, which ensured a quick electron transfer 
from excited CdSe to C60 and thus the 
successful collection of electrons. Besides, with 
the attachment of CdS nanoparticles, ZnO 
nanowires exhibited enhanced photocatalytic 
activities.4b This enhancement resulted from the 
band offsets between CdS and ZnO, which may 
retard charge recombination to capture more 
charge carriers for participation in 
photocatalysis. 
Photocatalysis is a valuable approach to 
practically utilize the solar power. In the last 
two decades, much research effort has been 
expanded to develop semiconductor 
photocatalysts because of their capability of 
converting light energy into chemical energy. 
Among the various composite systems, 
metal/semiconductor combination is of 
particular interest to photocatalytic 
applications.2,5 For metal/semiconductor 
composites, the presence of 
metal-semiconductor interface may induce 
effective charge separation to favour the 
subsequent photocatalysis. The most commonly 
used semiconductor photocatalysts have been 
metal oxides like TiO2, which exhibits 
ultraviolet absorption ability only due to its 
large bandgap energy. Many efforts have thus 
been made to modify TiO2 such that it can 
absorb visible light to carry out photocatalytic 
reactions. For example, through the doping of 
suitable elements, an additional electronic level 
can be created and located in the energy gap of 
TiO2, extending its light absorption range from 
ultraviolet to visible regions.6 In addition to the 
doped TiO2 photocatalysts, many other 
semiconductors that possess suitable bandgap 
energies are found to show fascinating 
photocatalytic activities upon sunlight 
illumination.7 CdS is one of the most popular 
visible-light-driven photocatalysts since it has a 
bandgap energy of 2.5 eV that corresponds well 
with the visible light. Furthermore, its 
conduction band at relatively negative potential 
(-1.0 versus NHE)8 offers CdS good 
photocatalytic activities. Till now, many 
structural forms of CdS including 
nanoparticles,9 hollow nanospheres,10 porous 
nanocrystals,11 nanowires,12 nanotubes,13 and 
nanocomposites14 have been proven effective in 
relevant photocatalytic processes. 
We previously showed that core-shell 
Au-CdS nanocrystals exhibited pronounced 
charge carrier separation upon light 
illumination.15 For Au-CdS nanocrystals, Au 
core can serve as an effective electron 
scavenger for CdS shell due to its lower Fermi 
energetic level (+0.5V versus NHE) than the 
conduction band of CdS (-1.0V versus NHE).8 
Consequently, the photoexcited electrons in 
CdS shell would preferentially transfer to Au 
core, leaving positively-charged holes in CdS 
domain to achieve charge carrier separation. In 
this work, we explored the interfacial charge 
carrier dynamics for Au-CdS nanocrystals with 
various shell thicknesses. By probing the

capacity of 30 mL was used as the photoreactor 
vessel. The optical system used for 
photocatalytic reaction consisted of a xenon 
lamp (500 W, with a light intensity of 175 
mW/cm2) and a bandpass filter (with the 
bandwidth of 400-700 nm) that ensured the 
irradiation in visible range. All the 
photocatalysis experiments were conducted at 
room temperature in air. Four kinds of 
photocatalysts including N-doped P-25 TiO2, 
commercial CdS powders (Aldrich-Sigma, with 
the particle size of 10-20 nm), CdS counterpart 
and Au-CdS nanocrystals were used and 
compared in the photodegradation of RhB. 
Typically, 5.4 mg of photocatalyst was added 
into 18 mL of RhB aqueous solution (1.0 × 10-5 
M) in the photoreactor vessel. Prior to 
irradiation, the suspension was stirred in the 
dark for 30 min to reach the adsorption 
equilibrium of RhB with photocatalyst. At 
certain time intervals of irradiation, 1.5 mL of 
the reaction solution was withdrawn and 
centrifuged to remove photocatalyst particles. 
The filtrates were analyzed with a UV-Visible 
spectrophotometer to measure the 
concentration variation of RhB through 
recording the corresponding absorbance of the 
characteristic peak at 553 nm. Furthermore, 
photodegradation of RhB (1.0 × 10-5 M) under 
natural sunlight by using Au-CdS nanocrystals 
(5.4 mg) as photocatalyst was also examined. 
Characterizations. The morphology and 
dimensions of Au-CdS nanocrystals were 
examined with a high-resolution TEM 
(HRTEM, JEOL JEM-3000) operated at 300 kV. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data 
were recorded with a VG Scientific Microlab 
350 electron spectrometer using Mg Kα (hυ = 
1253.6 eV) as X-ray source under a base 
pressure of 1.0 × 10-9 Torr. The spectrum 
resolution of XPS was 0.1 eV, and the pass 
energy for survey and fine scans was 40 eV. All 
the binding energies were calibrated by C 1s at 
284.6 eV. Photocurrent signals were recorded 
with a Keithley 2400 semiconductor analyzer. 
UV-Visible spectra were collected using a 
Hitachi 3900H at room temperature under 
ambient atmosphere. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
First, core-shell nanocrystals of Au-CdS 
were prepared in a hydrothermal process by 
using the pre-synthesized Au colloids and 
Cys/Cd complexes as the starting materials. 
The formation of Au-CdS nanocrystals 
involved the binding of Cys/Cd complexes 
toward Au nanoparticles, followed by the 
decomposition of Cys/Cd in the hydrothermal 
reaction and the subsequent growth of CdS 
onto the surfaces of Au. By suitably modulating 
the experimental parameters such as the 
volumes of Cys/Cd added, a controllable shell 
thickness of Au-CdS nanocrystals can be 
achieved. In this work, Au-CdS nanocrystals 
with three different shell thicknesses (9.0, 14.0 
and 18.6 nm) were prepared and compared. The 
present Au-CdS nanocrystals provide an ideal 
platform to study the interfacial charge carrier 
dynamics for metal-semiconductor core-shell 
heterostructures. Due to the difference in band 
structures between Au and CdS, a pronounced 
photoinduced charge separation took place at 
the interface of Au and CdS, resulting in the 
electron-charged Au core and the hole-enriched 
CdS shell. The electron-charging of Au core in 
Au-CdS nanocrystals can be revealed with the 
corresponding XPS analysis and photocurrent 
measurement. As shown by the XPS spectra of 
Figure 1(a), a binding energy of 84.1 eV of Au 
4f7/2 peak was found for pure Au colloid sample, 
which is in good agreement with the value of 
bulk metallic Au.17 However, a negative 
binding energy shift of around 0.5 eV of Au 
4f7/2 peak was observed for Au-CdS 
nanocrystals, indicating a significant difference 
in electronic structures between Au and CdS 
and a strong electronic interaction therein.18 
Similar phenomenon was ever reported in 
Au-SnO2 core-shell nanocrystal system, in 
which the binding energy shift of Au 4f was 
attributed to the effective electron transfer from 
SnO2 to Au.19 Here we ascribed the negative 
binding energy shift of Au 4f observed in 
Au-CdS nanocrystals to the electron-charging 
of Au core that resulted from the occurrence of 
 24
nanocrystals, it is reasonable to presume a less 
pronounced electron-hole interaction for 
Au-CdS with thicker CdS shell since they 
possessed a larger characteristic size of CdS 
and thus a less amount of surface states. Such 
less pronounced electron-hole interaction in 
fewer surface states prohibited charge carriers 
from being consumed in nonradiative 
recombination, which further enabled a fuller 
extent of participation of photoexcited electrons 
in the charge separation process. Accordingly, 
an increase in the electron-transfer rate constant 
was observed for Au-CdS nanocrystals with 
increasing shell thickness. 
 Since Au-CdS nanocrystals exhibited 
pronounced charge separation upon light 
illumination, it is worth studying the potential 
application that this property may bring. Owing 
to the effective electron transfer from CdS shell 
to Au core, photogenerated holes with an 
abundant amount were existent in CdS shell 
and would transfer to the surfaces of Au-CdS 
nanocrystals. These highly reactive holes could 
oxidize water to produce hydroxyl radicals that 
can further decompose organic pollutants 
through an oxidation process. A spectacular 
capability of photocatalytic oxidation is 
therefore expected at the surfaces of Au-CdS 
nanocrystals. A series of photocatalysis 
experiments were performed in this work to 
investigate the photocatalytic properties of the 
as-synthesized Au-CdS nanocrystals. RhB, a 
typical dye that can be decomposed by 
hydroxyl radicals,24 was used as the test 
pollutant to monitor the photocatalytic 
oxidation progress for Au-CdS nanocrystals. 
The time-dependent UV-visible spectra of RhB 
solutions under visible light illumination in the 
presence of Au-CdS nanocrystals with a shell 
thickness of 14.0 nm were first shown in Figure 
3(a). It can be seen that the intensity of the 
characteristic absorption peak at 553 nm 
decreased dramatically with the irradiation time. 
Besides, a concomitant blue shift in the 
absorption maximum was observed after the 
solution was irradiated for 20 min. It is well 
known that the photodegradation of RhB 
undergoes two competitive processes.25 One is 
the destruction of dye chromogen, which is 
characteristic of the loss of absorbance at 553 
nm. The other is the N-demethylation reaction 
that produces a series of N-demethylated 
intermediates, accompanied by a blue shift in 
the absorption maximum from 553 to 498 nm. 
In the current case, RhB concentration was 
determined by referring to the absorbance of 
the characteristic peak at 553 nm. To 
quantitatively understand the reaction kinetics 
of RhB photodegradation for our samples, we 
analyzed the normalized concentration of RhB 
(C/Co) as a function of irradiation time. As 
shown in the inset of Figure 3(a), an 
exponential decay of RhB concentration with 
the irradiation time was evident for Au-CdS 
nanocrystal photocatalyst. The 
photodegradation process was then fit to 
pseudo-first-order reaction, in which the value 
of the apparent rate constant (kRhB) is equal to 
the slope of the fitting line according to the 
following expression:26 
ln(C/Co) = - kRhB t, where Co and C are the 
concentrations of RhB at initial and at a certain 
irradiation time t, respectively. 
For Au-CdS nanocrystals with a shell thickness 
of 14.0 nm, kRhB is found to be 0.026 min-1. The 
mechanism for RhB photodegradation by using 
Au-CdS nanocrystal photocatalyst can be 
described by the following four pathways: 
Au–CdS + hν Æ Au(e–)–CdS(h+)                (1) 
Au(e–)–CdS(h+) + H2O Æ Au(e–)–CdS + H+ + ·OH  (2) 
RhB + ·OH Æ oxidation products                (3) 
Au(e–)–CdS + O2 Æ Au-CdS + ·O2–              (4) 
Under visible light illumination, charge 
separation occurred within Au-CdS 
nanocrystals, resulting in an electron-charged 
Au core and a hole-enriched CdS shell (1). 
Subsequently, the photogenerated holes 
transferred to the surfaces of nanocrystals and 
reacted with water to produce hydroxyl radicals 
(2). RhB molecules were then decomposed by 
hydroxyl radicals through an oxidation process 
(3). Once the photogenerated holes were 
depleted in photocatalysis, Au-CdS 
nanocrystals underwent a Fermi level 
 26
an evident decoloration of the resultant solution. 
This result shows that the present Au-CdS 
nanocrystals can be used as highly efficient 
photocatalysts which may practically harvest 
energy from sunlight. As a final note, the 
as-prepared Au-CdS nanocrystals did not suffer 
significant photocorrosive oxidation as deduced 
from the XPS data. In Figure 5(c), both Cd and 
S XPS spectra of Au-CdS sample exhibit 
signals corresponding to the bulk CdS with the 
binding energies of 404.8, 411.6 and 161.8 eV 
for Cd 3d5/2, Cd 3d3/2 and S 2p core levels, 
respectively.29 For the S 2p XPS spectrum, note 
that no sulphate-related peak at around 168.4 
eV, which originated from the photocorrosive 
oxidation of CdS with oxygen and water,30 was 
observed. The absence of sulfate-related peak 
in S 2p spectrum indicates that the present 
Au-CdS nanocrystals exhibited considerably 
high stability in air, which is important to the 
durability performance during their use as 
photocatalysts. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In conclusion, the interfacial charge 
carrier dynamics for core-shell Au-CdS 
nanocrystals with various shell thicknesses 
were investigated and presented. Due to the 
difference in band structures between Au and 
CdS, a pronounced photoinduced charge 
separation took place at the interface of Au 
and CdS, resulting in the electron-charged 
Au core and the hole-enriched CdS shell. 
The electron-charging of Au core in Au-CdS 
nanocrystals was revealed with the 
corresponding XPS analysis and 
photocurrent measurement. Time-resolved 
PL data showed that a higher 
electron-transfer rate constant was observed 
for Au-CdS nanocrystals with thicker CdS 
shell. On the other hand, the hole-enriched 
CdS shell of Au-CdS nanocrystals upon light 
illumination was characterized with a 
photocatalytic process. The photocatalytic 
activity of Au-CdS nanocrystals was found 
to increase with increasing shell thickness, 
consistent with the result of electron-transfer 
rate constant variation. The current Au-CdS 
nanocrystals may find promising 
photocatalytic applications, especially in the 
photooxidative decomposition of various 
organic pollutants such as aldehydes31 and 
chlorinated hydrocarbons.32 The present 
study also gives rise to a new class of highly 
efficient metal/semiconductor hybrid 
photocatalysts which may effectively utilize 
the solar power.
