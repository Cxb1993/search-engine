21. Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) solar cells are semiconductor devices that transfer sunlight directly into electricity
by converting the energy of the light to electrons in the atoms of the cell. The converting process is called
the PV effect, and it is done without the use of either chemical reactions or moving parts (Milliken et al.,
2007). With the policies of many countries in promoting the PV solar cell industry, the industry has grown
tremendously, and the global production capacity of silicon solar cell increased from 52MWp in 2000 to
4.60GWp, 6.3GWp, 9.1GWp, and 12.0GWp in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively (Hirschman and
Schmela, 2006; Wang, 2008). Even though PV systems can offer cleaner and plentiful energy, the major
obstacle they face is that their energy cost is still too high (Hoffmann, 2006). The most commonly used
solar cell today is made from crystalline silicon, but the main trend of solar cell industry is toward the PV
silicon thin-film solar cell because of its potential reduction of production costs, low material
consumption, lower energy consumption and a shorter energy payback time (Duke et al., 2005). The
crystalline silicon material and energy consumption for making a PV silicon thin-film solar cell is only
1/10 of that for a traditional solar cell. However, solar radiation conversion efficiency (currently less than
12%), product stability (different absorption rates for lights with different wavelengths), and lifetime
(deformation after extensive sun exposure) for PV silicon thin-film solar cells all need to be enhanced
(Jager-Waldau, 2004; van Sark et al., 2007; Chen and Lin, 2008). In addition, thin-film technologies also
face a wide range of problems from the lack of knowledge of basic material properties, the availability
issues of production technologies to the legal concerns about patent infringements and the possible
market perspectives. Compared with Japan, US or Europe, Taiwan government has an urgent pressure to
formulate product strategies because its technologies are still behind those countries and its initial
investment costs are very high. However, Taiwan has a great potential since its production capacity in
semiconductor, flat panel display (FPD), and conventional PV solar cell industries, which are highly

product strategy for PV silicone thin-film solar cell power industry in Taiwan is necessary. In addition,
firms within a manufacturing network are forced to integrate and collaborate with each other in order to
develop new strategies, capacities and capabilities in a global competitive environment (Storey and
Emberson, 2006). Thus, in this study, the product strategy will be considered from the perspective of a PV
silicone thin-film solar cell power industry.
Product strategy involves decisions about target market, product mix, project prioritization, resource
allocation and technology selection. With a tremendous degree of complexity and uncertainty, multiple
strategic products are usually selected to increase the possibility of having a few successful projects
(Balbontin et al., 2000). In essence, it is a set of strategic decisions to ensure that the right markets and
products are pursued (Urban and Hauser, 1993). To facilitate the prosperousness of the PV silicone solar
cell power industry, this research develops a conceptual model, using fuzzy analytic network process
(FANP) with interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and benefits, opportunities, costs and risks (BOCR),
to help analyze suitable strategic products for the thin-film solar cell power manufacturing network.
43. A FANPmodel with ISM and BOCR for evaluating strategic products
A systematic FANP model incorporated with ISM and BOCR is proposed to help analyze the
suitable strategic products from the perspectives of a large firm in a PV silicone solar cell power
manufacturing network. The model is comprised of five phrases, as shown in Fig. 2, and the respective
steps are described here.
Phase I: Construction of a PV silicone solar cell product strategy evaluation network.
Step 1. Form a committee of experts in the PV silicone solar cell industry and define the problem for
selecting suitable strategic products.
Fig. 2. Flowchart of the proposed model.
Step 2. Construct a control hierarchy for the strategic product evaluation problem.
Step 3. Decompose the strategic product evaluation problem into a network with four sub-networks.
Phase II: Determination of the interdependence among criteria.
Step 4. Establish an adjacency matrix which shows the contextual relationship among the criteria under
each merit. In Phase II, ISM is adopted to determine the interdependence among the criteria.
The adjacency matrix mD is presented as follows:
6Phase V: Calculation of final priorities of the product strategies.
Step 16. Calculate overall priorities of the product strategies by synthesizing priorities of each product
strategy under each merit from Step 15 with the corresponding normalized weights b, o, c and r
from Step 10. There are five ways to combine the scores of each product strategy under B, O,
C and R (Saaty, 2003).
Additive:
Pi=bBi+oOi+c(1/Ci) Normalized +r(1/Ri) Normalized (5)
where Bi, Oi, Ci and Ri represent the synthesized results of product strategy i under merit B, O, C
and R, respectively, and b, o, c and r are normalized weights of merit B, O, C and R,
respectively.

4. A practical investigation for strategic products in industry
In order to examine the practicality of the proposed conceptual model, the PV silicon thin-film solar
cell power industry in Taiwan is used as an example. The purpose of the control hierarchy in Fig. 3 is to
calculate the priorities, b, o, c and r, of the four merits. The BOCR network has the same goal as the
control hierarchy does, and the purpose of this network is to calculate the priorities of the product
strategies. A set of questionnaire is completed by the experts to generate the priorities of the four merits
