The method of the design is based on the characteristic of the lattice direction of the silicon 
wafer as the packaging frame structure and the cantilever beam structure as the connection line 
with external signals. These two structures are integrated together into the design of a replaceable 
packaging device. Firstly, the <100> silicon wafer is etched a cavity of 54.74 degrees by KOH 
etchant; and then the solder bump and the cantilever beam structure are built by the 
photolithography and electroplate process. The cantilever beam could be to act as a path for the 
circuit transmission. In the bare chip, the copper is deposited by electroplating to be the bump and 
acts as a path for the external transmission circuit. At the least, a PI photoresist is used for the 
fixed seal after the chip inside the cavity. 
The resistance is measured as 1.7Ω after the packaging. The problem of the uneven bump 
size could be solved by this novel package method, and the cantilever beam could be 
transmission line of the electric requirements of the package

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The present packaging methods require soldering to connect the signals between the internal and 
external circuits of the silicon wafer, and the package trends to high-density assembly on the 
smaller circuit board by reducing the package size. Solder joints are generated to provide both 
mechanical protection and electrical connection form the typical wire bonding to flip-chip 
package. Lau [1] indicated that cracks induced from the stress concentration and almost occurred 
in the corner of the solder bump of the flip chip, and the reliability of the solder joint could be 
dependent of where the crack is. The height of solder joint and the material and thickness of 
underfill are the mainly factors to affect the reliability of the flip chip package [2,3].  
If a defect is appeared after the soldering, the package will be difficult to recondition the 
defect and the cost will be increase. The concept of the die replaced from the defected package 
 
Every symbol represents is as follows in the below:

L ?the distance between the bare chip and the bottom of the substrate 
X  ? the distance of the bare chip and <111> etched plane 
C ? the size of bare chip 
From the figure 2, the width of the bottom of the substrate after etching is derived as

The application of the cantilever beam shown in figure 1 is to be as solder bump for 
transmitting the signal. The flexibility of the cantilever beam could be applied to connect the bare 
chip and the substrate without the soldering. The CAE software (Pro/MECHANICA) is applied to 
do the displacement and stress analysis of the cantilever beam.

The maximum strain occurs at the fixed end of the cantilever beam and the strain is found to be

Using the same data of Nickle material properties from Table 2 substitutes into equation 6, 
then the strain value is 1.5×10-4.  The allowable maximum strain of Nickle is 2.85×10-4, 
therefore, the cantilever beam in the novel package could be applied to be the connector as solder 
joint.

4. RESULTS 
 
The basic concept for a package is to transmit electric current along the transmission line. To 
measure the difference of resistance between two measure points on the cantilever beam is 
applied to prove the novel package. First, the resistance of the cantilever beams is measured of 
0.66Ω from one end to the other end. Then, the resistance between the solder bumps of the bare 
chip is 1.01Ω. At last, the resistance is measured as 1.7Ω after the packaging.All of the measure 
process is shown in figure 12.

The problem of the uneven bump size could be solved by this novel package method, and the 
cantilever beam could be transmission line of the electric requirements of the package.
