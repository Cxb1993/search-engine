presented in [15] are statistical properties (i.e., mean, 
standard deviation, maximum and minimum values) of the 
short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, maximum power 
and fill factor of the cells.  
In addition to the aforementioned studies on the 
mismatch problem, the works of Gautam et al. [16-19] 
merit particular mention. Gautam et al. compared three 
interconnection schemes of PV cells: series-parallel (SP), 
total-cross-tied (TCT) and bridge-linked (BL), for their 
losses, maximum power, fill factors, reliabilities and 
energy yields considering mismatch caused by the 
manufacturer’s tolerances in cell characteristics and by 
partial shadowing, and concluded that both TCT and BL 
connection schemes have superior performance over the SP 
scheme. The tolerances in the cell characteristics were 
evaluated by the Monte Carlo technique in which the cell 
open-circuit voltage and photo-current were randomized 
with uniform distribution or Gaussian distribution. The PV 
array networks were analyzed by the Newton-Raphson 
method in [16], and by a linear programming technique in 
[17] to accelerate the solving speed. 
In this report, we analyze the electrical performance of a 
PV module with not only SP, TCT and BL connection 
configurations, but also with simple series (SS) and 
honeycomb (HC) connection configurations. The 
Newton-Raphson method is to be used to solve the array 
circuit. We will also propose a new model of PV cells, 
called the piecewise linear parallel branches model (PLPB 
model) [20], to analyze a mismatched PV module. The 
results obtained by the both methods will be compared to 
validate each other. This report starts with a brief 
introduction to the PLPB model. This is followed by the 
application of the proposed model to the analysis of partial 
shading of a PV module. The I-V curve, maximum power, 
fill factor and a loss index of a module with SS, SP TCT, 
BL and HC connection configurations will be compared 
and analyzed.   
II. Brief Introduction to the PLPB model 
Fig. 1 shows the single-diode equivalent circuit model 
[21] of PV cell which is commonly used in many studies 
and provides sufficient accuracy for most applications. In 
Fig. 1, IL is the light-generated current, Id and Vd the diode 
current and voltage, I and V the cell current and voltage, 
and Rs and Rp the cell series and parallel resistances. It can 
be seen from Fig. 1 that the nonlinearity of a PV cell is 
indeed attributed to the nonlinearity of the diode.

A. Basic Principle 
The basic principle of the PLPB model can be explained 
by Fig. 2 (a), in which a nonlinear curve f(x) is 
approximated by two (blue) and four (red) line segments. 
The approximation is further improved in Fig. 2 (b) by 
increasing the number of piecewise segments to eight. The 
higher is the number of linear segments, the better is the 
quality of approximation.

same curve approximated by eight line segments. 
 
The piecewise linear approximation technique 
explained above can be applied to approximating the 
nonlinear I-V curve of the diode by 2h linear segments as 
shown in Fig. 3, in which the diode I-V curve for Vd 
between zero and the cell open-circuit voltage Voc is 
depicted. The curve is first approximated by two line 
segments (dotted lines) with their corner voltage E2. The 
curve to the left of E2 is again approximated by two 
segments with a corner voltage E1; and the portion to the 
right of E2 approximated by another two segments with a 
corner voltage E3. Hence, the diode I-V curve is now 
approximated by four line segments (dashed lines) with 
three corner voltages E1, E2 and E3. This procedure 
continues until a required accuracy is obtained. It is noted 
that 2h line segments are used in the hth approximation step, 
and the larger the number h, the better the approximation. 
B. Realization of Equivalent Circuit 
In Fig. 3, when the diode I-V curve is approximated by 
four line segments with corner voltages E1, E2 and E3, and 
their respective slopes m1, m2, m3 and m4, the piecewise 
linearized I-V relation can be represented by four linear 
branches in parallel as shown by Fig. 4. Each branch 
consists of an ideal diode, a resistance and a voltage source 
in serious. In Fig. 4 the voltage source E0 is actually zero. 
We draw E0 to make all the branches have the same circuit 
structure.  The resistances in Fig. 4 are related to the 
segment slopes by the following equations: 
  4
D. Implementation of the PLPB Model 
The algorithm of the equal-area method described 
previously can be implemented in circuit simulation 
software such as PSIM or EMTP. Fig. 7 shows an example 
of four-branch model. In practical applications, more 
branches, e.g., 8, 16 or 32 branches, can be used for better 
approximation of the PV cell I-V characteristic. In Fig. 7, 
all the diodes are ideal. They actually serve as switches. 
The values of IL, R1, R2, R3, R4, E1, E2 and E3 are calculated 
and controlled at each simulation step by the control 
program according to the input values of solar irradiance 
and cell temperature. In EMTP for example, a control 
module called MODELS associated with the circuit serves 
to modeling the control behavior of the system to be 
simulated. Fig. 8 shows a screen snapshot of the 
four-branch circuit diagram that we draw using the 
ATPDraw program. ATPDraw is a pre-processor of the 
EMTP that allows users to draw circuit diagrams.

III. Analytical Modeling of a PV Module 
In this project we consider a PV module composed of 
36 PV cells, the interconnection scheme of which can be 
SS, SP, TCT, BL or HC. The mismatch considered is that 
caused by non-uniform solar irradiance received by each 
cell. The equivalent circuit of a cell has been shown in Fig. 
1, in which the light-generated current IL is proportional to 
the solar irradiance G and can be given by 
( )0 0( )L gI G G G I= ⋅  (8) 
where Ig0 is the light-generated current at the reference 
irradiance G0 that takes the value of 1 kW/m2. The I-V 
relation of the cell satisfies the following implicit function: 
( ), , ( ) ( ) sL d s
p
V IRf I V G I G I V IR I
R
+= − + − − =0 (9) 
where Id refers to the diode current given by (7). When 
analyzing a module circuit, we begin with writing the 
equations governing the I-V relations of the 36 cell, then 
apply Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws (KVL and KCL) 
to loops and nodes to write equations according to the 
circuit topology.  
A. Simple Series Connection Configuration 
The simplest configuration of PV cells in a PV module 
is SS in which we connect 36 cells in series as shown in Fig. 9. 
The I-V relation of each cell is given by 
( , , ) 0,  1, 2, 3, , 36m k kf I V kλ = = …  (10) 
where f refers to the implicit function of (9), λk and Vk to 
the solar irradiance and the voltage of the kth cell, Im and 
Vm to the current and voltage of the module. For the SS 
configuration, all the cells have the same current equal to 
the module current, so no KCL equation is required.  
There is only one closed loop in the SS configuration. 
The corresponding KVL equation is

It is noted that an SS module has 37 unknowns: 36 cell 
voltages and the module current. Eq. (10) actually 
represents 36 independent equations, which with (11) make 
up a set of 37 equations that allow the 37 variables to be 
solved.

B. Series-Parallel Connection Configuration 
The circuit of SP configuration is shown in Fig. 10 (a). 
The module has four parallel strings, each contains nine 
cells connected in series. We can write the I-V relations of 
the 36 cells as 
( , , ) 0,  1,  2, 3, , 36.n k kf I V kλ = = …  (12)

up a total of 61 equations.

IV. Results of Performance Evaluation 
To evaluate the performance of the five aforementioned 
cell connection configurations under the mismatch caused 
by non-uniform solar irradiance striking the module, we 
use a random number generator to generate 36 irradiance 
values that are uniformly distributed between 0.85 and 1.01 
kW/m2 as shown in Fig. 12. These values are used to 
analyze the five PV cell connection schemes with both the 
analytical model and the PLPB model.

B. Performance Evaluation 
The maximum power and the fill factor of a module 
with a specific connection configuration under the solar 
irradiance condition as shown in Fig. 12 are listed in Table 
I for comparison. In terms of the maximum power, the TCT 
and HC configurations rank the first two positions. 
However, in terms of the fill factor, the SP configuration 
has the highest value although the differences between 
these values are rather small. 
In Table II we compare the voltages and currents of four 
cells corresponding to five different connection 
configurations. The four cells' locations and their number 
are listed in the firs column. The intensities of solar 
irradiance striking on these cells are different but kept 
unchanged for all the connection configurations. Because 
of change of the cell connection configuration, the voltage 
across a specific cell may change also. For example, the 
cell no. 23 located at 5-3 has negative voltages for SS, SP 
and TCT configurations, but has positive voltage for BL 
and HC configurations. Table II (b) shows the variations of 
currents caused by the connection configuration.

V. Conclusions 
In this project, we have developed two methods for 
analyzing PV modules with five different cell connection 
configurations: SS, SP, TCT, BL and HC. The first method 
is the PLPB model which is a circuit-oriented method and 
is suitable to be applied in a circuit simulation program 
such an EMTP. The second method is an analytical model 
based on the nonlinear I-V characteristics of solar cell and 
the KVL and KCL relations of cell connection circuits, and 
it needs to be solved by the Newton-Raphson algorithm. 
The results obtained by these two methods have been 
presented and are comparable and agree well with each 
other. 
The evaluation of the five connection configurations has 
been carried out by applying to the 36 cells in a module a 
randomly generated solar irradiance which is uniformly 
distributed between 0.85 and 1.01 kW/m2, and comparing 
the maximum powers and the fill factors for the five 
connection schemes.

二、與會心得 
此次會議筆者所發表的論文是有關太陽能電池模組在部份遮蔽情況下的模型與分
析，這個主題與再生能源 (尤其是太陽能) 的使用有密切的關係，大部份有關太陽光電的
研究還是以理想狀態的假設為主，並未考慮太陽能電池可能受到的遮蔽與失配 (mismatch) 
問題，因此筆者所關注的問題可以為此研究領域提供一個先導的探討。在太陽能電池的
電路模型方面，筆者所提出的片段線性並聯支路模型並未引起太大的注意，但是筆者相
信在不久的將來，這個模型會有大量的應用出現。 
其他有關太陽能的研究中，筆者注意到南韓 Hanyang University 由 Ahmad 與 Kim 所提
出的一種低成本的太陽能電池最大功率追蹤技術，這種方法簡單而迅速、成本低廉，只
需要迴授電壓即可，缺點是精確度稍低，不過可以從控制電路的低功率消耗得到補償。 
在永續能源的議題方面，印度 Ranchi University 的 Suresh Prasad Singh 教授提出從全球
競爭力與永續環境的觀點展望全球暖化與印度礦產資源 (尤其是煤) 的發展方向，令人印
象深刻。

three corner voltages E1, E2 and E3. This procedure continues 
until a required accuracy is obtained. It is noted that 2h line 
segments are used in the hth approximation step, and the larger

I-V relation can be represented by four linear branches in 
parallel as shown by Fig. 3. Each branch consists of an ideal 
diode, a resistance and a voltage source in serious. In Fig. 3 the 
voltage source E0 is actually zero. We draw E0 to make all the 
branches have the same circuit structure.  The resistances in 
Fig. 3 are related to the segment slopes by the following 
equations:

When Vd <0, Id = 0. When 10 dV E  , the diode of the first

To generalize, we replace the diode in Fig. 1 with a k-branch 
diode equivalent circuit (k=2h). The result is shown in Fig. 4

PV cell. The resistances in Fig. 4 have a more general

C. Determination of Corner Voltages 
The resistances of the PLPB model are related to the slopes 
by (2) and (3). However, before all the slopes of line segments 
can be determined, we need to determine the corner voltages. 
An easiest way to determine the corner voltages E1, E2,...,Ek-1 is  
to place them equally spaced over the interval of interest. In the 
case of Fig. 2, the interval was (0, Voc) but this can be changed 
according to our need. Equally spaced corner voltages do not 
allow the piecewise linear segments to best approximate the 
curve. In this paper we propose a more efficient method that, 
for a given number of linear segments, allows a better 
approximation. 
Fig. 5 shows a known curve g(x) which is to be approximated 
by two linear segments L1(x) and L2(x) over the interval (xL, xR). 
The corner point xG needs to be determined. We propose an 
equal-area method that is to find xG so that the areas formed by 
the curve g(x) and the two line segments L1(x) and L2(x) are 
equal, i.e., A1=A2. The equal-area method has an advantage of 
fitting high curvature portion with shorter segment, which 
automatically improves the quality of approximation. A 
function f(xG) is defined as the difference between areas A1 and 
A2.

modules in series. When one cell is shaded with shading per-
centage from 0% to 100%, the simulated I-V characteristics 
using the PLPB model are shown in Fig. 9 in which the circles

ture for an unshaded cell are 1 kW/m2 and 50 C , and are zero 
to 0.75 kW/m2 and 25 C  for the shaded cell.

B. Effect of the Number of Shaded Cells 
In a PV module composed of 36 cells in series, the number of 
shaded cells influences the module performance. In this section, 
how the number of shaded cells affects the I-V curve of an array 
is studied. The notations A and Bn used in [8] are also used in 
this paper. They are briefly explained as follows: 
A: All the 36 cells are unshaded with G=1.0 kW/m2 and 
Tc=50 C . 
Bn: n cells are shaded with irradiance G=0.25 kW/m2 and 
Tc=50 C while (36-n) cells are unshaded with G=1.0 kW/m
2 
and Tc=50 C
 . Hence, B2 means the module has 2 shaded cells 
and 34 unshaded cells in series; B36 means all the cells are 
shaded, and so forth.  
The simulation result in Fig. 10 shows the I-V characteristic 
of a module with the number of shaded cells from zero to 36. 
For the effect of the number of shaded cells on array, two cases 
are considered. The first case is the shaded cells in the same 
module as shown in Fig. 11 where the right-most module has 
one, two and three shaded cells. The corresponding I-V curves 
are shown in Fig. 12 in which it is observed that for this case 
the number of shaded cells does not affect the resulting 
maximum power point. In the second case, the shaded cells are 
located in different modules, and each module has at most one 
shaded cell, as shown in Fig. 13. The corresponding I-V curves 
are depicted in Fig. 14 where it is seen that the number of 
shaded cells has significant influence on the maximum power 
point.

IV. CONCLUSION 
A novel circuit-oriented PLPB model for PV cell has been 
presented in this paper. It is based on piecewise linear parallel 
branches. The number of the branches can be adjusted to meet 
the required accuracy of simulation. An equal-area algorithm 
has also been proposed to determine the parameters of the 
PLPB model. The proposed PLPB model can easily be im-
plemented in circuit simulation software to simulate power 
systems containing PV arrays. The EMTP has been used to 
show how the PLPB model is incorporated in the simulation 
program. 
Applications of the PLPB model have been presented in this 
paper with emphasis placed on the analysis of partially shaded 
PV modules. Various problems associated with partial shading 
have been simulated using the PLPB model, including effects 
of shading percentage, effects of the number of shaded cells, 
and effects of bypass diodes. Also studied is a comparison of the 
performance of four connection configurations (i.e., SP, TCT, 
BL and HC) of PV cells at the presence of partial shading. All 
the applications show that the PLPB model is ease to use,
