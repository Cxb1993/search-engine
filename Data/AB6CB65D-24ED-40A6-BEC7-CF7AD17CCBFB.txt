measures on vehicle emissions and recommended potential emissions savings can be achievable from efficient 
trip chaining behaviour, ridesharing among household members and technological advances in vehicle 
emissions control devices. From their work the maximum vehicle emissions reduction estimates could be 
expected through adjustments in travel behaviour such as optimal scheduling and linking of the activities 
performed by individuals in a household. Recently, Vardoulakis et al. (2008) estimated the impacts and 
uncertainties of traffic management interventions, particularly for exposures to carcinogenic polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons. Using a suite of emission calculator and a dispersion model in conjunction with a 
geographic information system, the impact of the traffic management can be identified deterministically. The 
overall model predicted that traffic management scheme would lead to a minor reduction in population 
exposure to benzopyrene, however, the uncertainty associated with the exposure estimates was much higher 
than this reduction. 
 Because traffic flow and speed are the principle variables for the levels of air pollution, any changes 
in the parameters will directly affect environmental equality. Most particular pollutant concentrations are 
generated by emissions in the immediate vicinity of signalized junctions where vehicle queues take place. 
Moreover, they may also have global effects, since traffic-induced emissions constitute a significant portion of 
the greenhouse emissions. Changes in the transportation system by encouraging or restricting travel demand 
can not only affect travel patterns but also influence the movements of traffic flows by facilitating or 
restraining traffic flow conditions. In fact, traffic signal improvement is one of the most widespread traffic 
congestion and safety management practices. Concerning the impact of traffic signal controls at urban 
signalized junctions on air pollution, Li et al. (2004) presented an integrated optimization model of traffic 
quality, emissions and fuel consumption for individual signal controlled junctions where vehicular platoons 
between junctions are not considered. In Li’s model, a weighted average performance index function for 
optimization was defined to reduce vehicle delays, fuel consumption and emissions at signalized junctions. 
The signal setting variables such as green time durations and cycle time length are determined optimally 
subject to minimum greens constraints for specified signal phases. Hallmark et al. (2000) studied the effects 
of signal timings on carbon monoxide emissions and observed significant reductions in carbon monoxide 
emissions when the delay times at signalized junctions were reduced. Hallmark et al. proposed an 
activity-specific modelling approach using the MEASURE model where on-road vehicle activity profiles 
were collected at a wide variety of signalized junctions and the mode-specific emission rates were developed 
accordingly. Unal et al. (2003) employed an on-board emissions measurement system to collect on-road data. 
They conducted an empirical approach using real-world, on-board vehicle emissions measurement to evaluate 
the effects of arterial traffic signal timing and coordination on the basis of field data collection. The use of 
on-board emissions measurement system is fundamentally different from the standardized driving cycles 
which are widely used in macroscopic models such as COPERT (Ntziachristos and Samaras, 2000), MOBILE 
(US Environmental Protection Agency, 2003) and EMFAC (California Air Resource Board, 2000). A study 
carried out in Coelho et al. (2005) confirmed for highway traffic speed control that standardized driving 
cycles used in the macroscopic emissions models were less appropriate for evaluating the effects of traffic 
interruptions causing due to speed-control traffic signals on the emissions. Considering the effects of highway 
traffic speed control traffic signals on emissions, Coelho et al. (2005) conducted a modelling approach for 
effectively measuring traffic and emission performance of speed control traffic signals. They established links 
between the signal-control variables such as the minimum signal settings, speed threshold setting and 
 5
problems.  
In the following, an emission-minimized signal setting problem is considered in a complicated signalized 
road network where short spacing between junctions is taken into account. We formulate this 
emission-minimized signal setting problem as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) 
because the response of users’ behaviour is considered. The vehicular emissions estimates are evaluated on the 
basis of the traffic model in TRANSYT together with empirical emission factors adopted from Unal et al. 
(2003). Due to the non-differentiability of the equilibrium flow for the emission-minimized signal setting 
problem, a bundle subgradient projection (BSP) method is proposed to solve this problem with global 
convergence. Numerical calculations are conducted on an example road network where computational 
comparisons are made with delay-minimizing signal settings on various sets of initial data. The organization 
of this paper is as follows. In next section, an emission-minimized signal setting problem is formulated as an 
MPEC problem. The first-order sensitivity analysis for obtaining the generalized gradient and the associated 
directional derivatives can be conveniently obtained. In Section 3, we presented a new solution scheme for an 
emission-minimized signal setting problem. The convergence of the solution scheme is established. In Section 
4 numerical calculations are conducted using an example road network and comparisons are made with those 
did by delay-minimizing signal settings. Concluding remarks for this emission-minimized signal settings and 
future work are summarized in Section 5. 
2. Numerical examples and computational comparisons 
In this section, numerical experiments are conducted using a medium-size example road network which 
was first used by Allsop and Charlesworth (1977). This numerical test road network includes 22 pairs of 
trip-ends and 23 links at 6 signalized junctions. Basic layouts of the example road network and allocations for 
signal groups for each junction are given in Figs. 1 and 2. Fixed data for the example road network are given 
in Tables 1 and 2. Following modal emissions approach in Unal et al. (2003), the average emission rates based 
on on-board measurements are adopted and summarized in Table 3. Using typical values found in practice, the 
minimum green time for each group is 7 seconds, and the clearance times are 5 seconds between incompatible 
signal groups. The maximum cycle time is set 180 seconds.  
In order to illustrate the capacity of the proposed method for the emission-minimized signal settings, 
numerical comparisons are made with well-known delay-minimizing signal settings methods such as the 
iterative optimization assignment (IOA for short, Allsop and Charlesworth, 1977), capacity-maximizing (CM 
for short, Smith, 1980) and recently proposed genetic algorithm (GA for short, Ceylan and Bell, 2004). Since 
this emission-minimized signal setting problem is a non-convex problem, various initial signal settings will 
affect the convergence of the solutions for problem (16). In the following numerical tests, in order to 
understand and investigate the robustness and sensitivity of the solution methods to initial data for the 
emission-minimized and delay-minimizing signal settings, three distinct sets of initial signal settings are 
considered and summarized in Table 4.  
For the delay-minimizing signal settings, link travel times are decided by the sum of non-delay travel 
time along this link and average delay incurred by traffic at the downstream junction. For each 
signal-controlled junction, the travel times on entering links will be affected by the changes of the 
corresponding signal settings and for non-signal controlled links the travel times are constant throughout this 
computation process. For the emission-minimized signal settings, total emissions for carbon monoxide (CO), 
hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NO) can be therefore estimated as product of weighted travel delays 
 7
delay-minimizing signal settings.   
Considering the performance of the proposed solution method BSP for emission-minimized signal 
settings on the carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions reduction at 
three sets of initial signal settings, as it can be obviously seen in Table 5, the BSP outperforms other methods 
with great significance except for the HC emissions reduction when compared to the GA method at the second 
set of initial signal settings. For example, for the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions reduction, the BSP method 
outperforms IOA, CM and GA by nearly 21%, 17% and 12% at the first set of initial signal settings. For the 
nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions reduction, the BSP method outperforms IOA, CM and GA by nearly 25%, 
21% and 12% at the second set of initial signal settings. For the hydrocarbons (HC) emissions reduction, the 
BSP method outperforms IOA, CM and GA by nearly 10%, 13% and 15% at the third set of initial signal 
settings. Analogously, concerning the performance of the proposed BSP method for delay-minimizing signal 
settings, as it can be observed in Table 6, the BSP method outperformed all other solutions methods for three 
sets of initial signal settings.  
When compared to two different kinds of performance index for signal settings, i.e. the 
emission-minimized signal settings in (2) and the delay-minimizing signal settings in (1), the proposed BSP 
method did achieve relatively different signal settings with corresponding objective function values as it can 
be found in Tables 5 and 6. For example, the BSP decreased more emissions reduction in CO, HC and NO for 
the objective function (2) than did those in CO, HC and NO for the objective function (1) at the third set of 
initial signal settings. Similarly, the BSP generated less travel delays for the objective function (1) than those 
for the objective function (2) at three sets of initial signal settings.    
3. Conclusions and discussions 
 In this paper, we presented an emission-minimized signal setting problem to effectively reduce 
deleterious vehicular emissions for congested road network. We formulated this emission-minimized signal 
setting problem as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) where the route choices of 
road users between pairs of origins and destinations are taken into account. Due to the non-differentiability of 
the equilibrium flow for the emission-minimized signal setting problem, a bundle subgradient projection (BSP) 
method was proposed to solve this problem with global convergence. Numerical calculations were conducted 
on an example road network with various sets of initial signal settings. Computational comparisons were also 
made with delay-minimizing signal settings on various sets of initial data. As it was reported, the proposed 
solution method BSP achieved greater performance in traffic-induced emissions reduction over those did other 
well-known solution methods. Considering a time-varying vehicular behavior and queue set back within a 
dynamic traffic model, further investigations are being made for effective emissions reduction control in a 
signal-controlled road network. We will discuss this issue in a subsequent paper.

Suwansirikul et al. [13] proposed a simple heuristic called the equilibrium decomposed optimization (EDO for short) to
solve a network design problem with equilibrium ﬂows. Using the results from sensitivity analysis [14] for non-linear
equilibrium network ﬂows, Suh and Kim [11], Clegg et al. [15] and Meng et al. [16] employed the bi-level programming
technique to tackle a non-linear road network design problem. Ceylan and Bell [9] presented a genetic algorithm to solve a
non-linear signal setting optimization problem with equilibrium network ﬂow. Recently, Erkut and Gzara [3] proposed a
bi-level model accounting for hazardous material transportation where the government designates a network, and the car-
riers choose the routes on the network. They proposed a solution heuristic exploiting the network ﬂow structure at both
levels and overcoming the difﬁculty and instability of the bi-level integer programming problem. Chiou [17] also tested a
number of computational algorithms for a non-linear equilibrium network design problem where only users’ route choice
was considered.
Regarding the ways in solving a non-linear area trafﬁc control system optimally, TRANSYT [18] has been widely recog-
nized as one of the most useful tools in studying the optimization of ﬁxed-time coordinated trafﬁc signals. As it has been
widely indicated, trafﬁc ﬂows and travel costs are strongly inﬂuenced by operations of signals and expansions of link capac-
ities. Ways of using mathematical programming to solve the constrained optimization problem of signal settings and equi-
librium ﬂows with ﬁxed travel demands have been well researched as well. For example, Allsop and Charlesworth [19]
proposed a mutually consistent calculation, which was also known as an iterative optimization assignment for non-linear
signal setting minimization problem. The resulting mutually consistent signal settings and network ﬂows will, however,
in general be a non-optimal solution as has been discussed by authors of [20,21]. Recognizing the non-linearity between sig-
nal settings and equilibrium ﬂows, Heydecker and Khoo [22] proposed a linear constraint approximation to equilibrium ﬂow
and solved a non-linear signal setting problem as a constrained optimization problem in a sequence of linear approximation.
Yang and Yagar [12] proposed a sensitivity analysis based algorithm to solve a non-linear inequality constrained optimiza-
tion problem for a signalized road network. Yang and Yagar constructed a linearized sub-problem for the non-linear inequal-
ity constrained signalized road network and iteratively solved the problem. Cipriani and Fusco [23] presented a new
algorithm which applies Armijo step length rule to general projected gradient algorithm for a global signal setting problem
with user equilibrium network ﬂows. Investigations on the shape of the objective function together with algorithm proper-
ties are also conducted via numerical calculations on a small test network. Cascetta et al. [24] discussed models and algo-
rithms for the optimization of urban signal settings with stochastic trafﬁc assignments where numerical tests are
reported on a small-scale real network. Because of the non-linearity of area trafﬁc control system in equilibrium constraints,
solution algorithmsmentioned above can simply solve the non-linear inequality constrained optimization problems of signal
settings and link capacity expansions only locally. Also, the effectiveness of various solution algorithms has not been widely
tested using a variety of large-scale road networks and hence the applicability and robustness of these solution algorithms to
real road networks remained unknown.
As it has been noticed in the literatures [15–17], the area trafﬁc control optimization and network design problem is a
non-convex problem and only local optima can be obtained. In this paper, due to the non-linearity and non-differentiability
of signal setting and link capacity expansion in equilibrium constraints, we present a novel algorithm to locally solve the
non-linear inequality constrained optimization problem of signal settings and link capacity expansions with elastic equilib-
rium ﬂows. In the optimization process for trip distribution and equilibrium ﬂow, not only the signal settings and link capac-
ity expansions need to be considered but also the consequential effects on trip distribution and equilibrium ﬂow caused by
signal settings and link capacity expansions need to be taken into account as well. Such a non-linear inequality constrained
optimization problem can be formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC for short) (see
[25]). For an area trafﬁc capacity control system with elastic equilibrium ﬂows, a coordinated signal timing plan can be de-
ﬁned by the common cycle time, the start and duration of greens. Following the work of Chiou [26], the performance index
for signal settings and link capacity expansions can be deﬁned as the monetary sum of a weighted linear combination of rate
of delay and number of stops per unit time for all trafﬁc streams and link capacity expansion investment costs, which are
constrained by practical limits of signal setting and link capacity expansion variables.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In next section, a non-linear area trafﬁc capacity control system of signal set-
ting and link capacity expansion with elastic equilibrium ﬂow can be formulated as an MPEC program. The ﬁrst-order sen-
sitivity analysis of the non-linear inequality constrained optimization problem of signal settings and link capacity
expansions can be performed with elastic equilibrium ﬂows. Since the area trafﬁc control optimization is non-convex, in Sec-
tion 3, we present a locally optimal solution method to solve a non-linear constrained optimization problemwith global con-
vergence. In Section 4, a variety of test networks and a real data road network are illustrated to quantify the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed method. Conclusions and discussions for this paper are summarized in Section 5.
2. Problem formulation
For an area trafﬁc capacity control system, a non-linear inequality constrained optimization problem with respect to sig-
nal settings and link capacity expansions can be formulated in the following way. First, a user equilibrium trafﬁc assignment
problem with elastic travel demands can be generalized as a variational inequality. Next, a parameterized variational
inequality for elastic equilibrium ﬂow with respect to signal settings and link capacity expansions can be delivered. Notation
used in this paper is summarized below.

2.4. Sensitivity analysis by directional derivatives
Let S(, ) denote the solution set for elastic equilibrium ﬂows deﬁned in (2) with signal settingsW and link capacity expan-
sions y. Suppose the solution set S(, ) is locally Lipschitz. Following the results developed by Qiu and Magnanti [27], the ﬁrst-
order sensitivity analysis of (2) can be established in the following way. Given an arbitrary path ﬂow p* together with the
corresponding equilibrium ﬂow and trip distribution (f*,q*), and the travel costs p* at signal settings W* and link capacity
expansions y*, let the changes in link or path ﬂow with respect to the changes in variables denoted by gf ðW ;yÞ or gp W ;yð Þ.
The changes in travel demands with respect to the changes in variables denoted by gqðW ;yÞ. The subgradients (gf,gq) of (2)
can be obtained in the following way: introduce

linear inequality constrained optimization problem (6)–(11).

The performance index in (6) is deﬁned as the monetary sum of a weighted linear combination of rate of delay and number of
stops per unit time for all trafﬁc streams and link capacity expansion investment costs, which can be referred to the well-
known TRANSYT model [18]. The details of the rate of delay and number of stops per unit time for the computations in
TRANSYT can be referred to Chiou [26] for details. The constraints in (7)–(11) are practical limits for signal settings and link
capacity expansions. The ﬁrst constraint (7) gives the lower and upper bounds for the common cycle time of a coordinated
ﬁxed-time signal-controlled road network. The constraints (8)–(10) are practical limits for green phase, link capacity and
clearance time. The constraint (11) is an upper bound for link capacity expansions. Also the equilibrium ﬂow and trip dis-
tribution f*(W,y) and q*(W,y) in the objective function (6) can be found by solving the non-linear parametric variational
inequality (2).
2.6. An MPEC program
Regarding the non-linear inequality constrained optimization problem for a signalized road network system in (6)–(11), a
non-linear mathematical program with equilibrium constraints program can be formulated in the following way. In
S.-W. Chiou / Applied Mathematical Modelling 35 (2011) 650–666 653
According to Clarke [28], the generalized gradient is a convex hull of all points of the form limrH(Wk,yk) where the subse-
quence {(Wk,yk)} converges to the limit value (W*,y*). And the gradients in (16) evaluated at Wk; yk; f k; qk

can be expressed
in the following way:

where the subgradients gf and gq can be obtained from (4).
3.2. A trust region method
Trust region method is a kind of important and efﬁcient methods in the area of non-linear optimization. This method can
be traced back to the works of Levenberg [34] and Marquardt [35] on non-linear least-squares problems and the work of
Goldfeld et al. [36] for unconstrained optimization. This class of methods iteratively solves a restricted sub-problem based
on a quadratic function model and gets a robust solution. Powell [37] was the ﬁrst to establish the convergence result of trust
region method for unconstrained optimization. Fletcher [38], on the other hand, proposed trust region algorithms for linearly
constrained optimization problems. Vardi [39], Yuan [40], Zhang and Zhu [41] proposed various trust region algorithms for
non-linear constrained optimization problems and established global convergence. Trust region methods are also efﬁcient
for non-smooth optimization problems and non-convex optimization problems (see [42–47]). Consider the following opti-
mization problem:
Min
x
HðxÞ: ð18Þ
Let Dk denote a trust region radius, we introduce Bk an approximate Hessian matrix for sub-problemHk at iterate k, and gk a
subgradient for Hk at iterate k. The trust region sub-problem Hk at iterate k for solving (18) is

According to Yuan and Sun [45], the reduction in the predicted descent of the objection function for the sub-problemHk, we
have the following lemma:
Lemma 3 (Reduction in the predicted descent of the objection, [45]). Let ek denote the predicted descent of the objection
function Hk at the kth iteration, i.e.
ek ¼ Hkð0Þ HkðdkÞ: ð20Þ

3.3. A trust region based subgradient projection and contractive method
With regard to the solutions for the non-linear inequality constrained optimization problem (13), in this section, we pres-
ent a computationally efﬁcient novel algorithm: a trust region based subgradient projection and contractive method to solve
the problem (13). In the following, a number of mathematical propositions are established ﬁrst. Let PrP (x) 2P denote the
projection of x on set P.
Proposition 4. For given signal settings W and link capacity expansions y, let P(W, y) denote the feasible solution set for non-
linear inequality constrained optimization problem (13). Then for each (x,z) 2P(W, y) there exists a point (u,v) 2P(W, y) such
that
kðx; zÞ  ðu; vÞk 6 kðx; zÞ  ða; bÞk; 8ða; bÞ 2 PðW; yÞ; ð22Þ
and (u,v) is known as the projection of (x,z) on the set P (W, y) with respect to the Euclidean norm,
ðu;vÞ ¼ PrPðW;yÞðx; zÞ ¼ argmin
ða;bÞ2PðW;yÞ
kðx; zÞ  ða; bÞk: ð23Þ
S.-W. Chiou / Applied Mathematical Modelling 35 (2011) 650–666 655
The inequality (34) becomes
ðW; yÞ þ d PrPðW;yÞððW; yÞ þ dÞ
 t PrPðW;yÞððW; yÞ þ dÞ  ða; bÞ P 0: ð36Þ
Because in (25), the error bound function for (35) is
EðW; y;PÞ ¼ ðW; yÞ  PrPðW;yÞððW; yÞ þ dÞ: ð37Þ
Thus in (36) it becomes
ðEðW; y;PÞ þ dÞtððW; yÞ  ða; bÞ  EðW; y;PÞÞP 0; 8ða; bÞ 2 PðW; yÞ: ð38Þ
Let (a,b) = (W*,y*), it implies
ðW; yÞ  W; yð Þð ÞtðEðW; y;PÞ þ dÞP EðW; y;PÞðEðW; y;PÞ þ dÞ: ð39Þ
Let
~d ¼ EðW; y;PÞ þ d: ð40Þ
We have the following from (39):
ðW; yÞ  W; yð Þð Þt~dP EðW; y;PÞ~d ¼ EðW; y;PÞk k2 þ EðW; y;PÞd: ð41Þ
Assume that there exists a l > 1 such that
EðW; y;PÞdP ðl 1ÞkEðW; y;PÞk2: ð42Þ
Thus in (41) we have
ðW; yÞ  W; yð Þð Þt~dP EðW; y;PÞ~dP lkEðW; y;PÞk2; ð43Þ
with l > 1.
Theorem 8 (A trust region based subgradient projection and contractive method). For given signal settings and link capacity
expansions (W,y) let P(W,y) denote the feasible solution set for the non-linear inequality constrained optimization problem (13).
Given arbitrary iterate (Wk,yk) 2P(W, y), for k = 1,2, . . ., let l 2 (0,2) be a constant. Let Dk denote a trust region radius and Bk
denote an approximate Hessian matrix for H (W k,yk), a search direction dk solves the following sub-problem for (13) using the
technique of trust region method:

4. Numerical calculations
In this section, numerical experiments are conducted using a real data road network and a variety of large-scale example
networks. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed solution method for the area trafﬁc con-
trol optimization problem, numerical tests are also performed with other well-knownmethods such as the non-optimal iter-
ative optimization assignment (IOA for short) [19], the sensitivity analysis based (SAB for short) [12] and recently proposed
methods: the augmented Lagrangian algorithm (ALA for short) [16] and the genetic algorithm (GA for short) [9]. The elastic
travel demand inverse function is adopted in the following form (58) which can be referred to Nagurney [48]. For any origin-
destination pair w, letmw denote a travel time coefﬁcient associated with the trip distribution qw where mw 2 [1,10], and let
tw denote the travel demand inverse function qw intercept for origin-destination w, "w 2W, where tw 2 [10,100].
qw ¼ mwqw þ tw; 8w 2W: ð58Þ
Using typical values found in practice, the minimum green time for each group is 7 s, and the clearance times are 5 s between
incompatible signal groups. The maximum cycle time is set at 180 s. Implementations for carrying out the following solution
methods were made on SUN SPARC SUNW, 900 MHz processor with 4 GB RAM under Unix SunOS 5.8 using C++ compiler.
The stopping criterion is set when the relative difference in the objective function value is less than 0.1%.
4.1. Computational tests on real data Sioux Falls road network
In order to numerically demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efﬁcacy of the solution methods for area trafﬁc
control optimization, the Sioux Falls city network [7] with 12 selected signalized junctions was used for illustration and
shown in Fig. 1. Three distinct sets of initial data were employed and summarized in Table 1 for numerical tests. The
non-signalized link travel times used in the Sioux Falls road network are adopted from [13]. Computational results for three
sets of initial signal settings are summarized in Tables 2–4. The performance index is expressed in terms of monetary factors
for the following examples where the conversion value can be referred to Chiou [26]. As it is obviously observed in Tables 2–
4, multiple local optima exist due to the non-convexity and non-linearity of the area trafﬁc control network system and evi-
dently each method leads to a different solution.
For the ﬁrst set of initial signal settings, as it is seen in Table 2, the proposed TPC achieved the best performance with the
value of $971, which greatly improved the initial performance index of the area trafﬁc control network system by 30.94%.
Conventional methods like IOA and SAB, respectively, improved the performance index by 23.04% and 28.02%. The recently
proposed methods: ALA and GA also improved the performance index nearly by 29%. With respect to the computational efﬁ-
cacy in solving the area trafﬁc control network system, the proposed TPC took 28% and 40% CPU times as those did the IOA
and SAB. Furthermore, in comparison with two recently proposed methods, the proposed TPC took only 21% CPU times as
those did the GA and ALA. For the second set of initial signal settings, as it is seen in Table 3, the proposed TPC achieved
the best performance with the value of $973, which greatly improved the initial performance index by 40.38%. Conventional
methods like IOA and SAB also improved the performance index by 22.73% and 31.86%. The recently proposed methods: ALA
and GA also, respectively, improved the performance index nearly by 33% and 37%. With respect to the computational efﬁ-
cacy of solution methods, the proposed TPC took 27% and 38% CPU times as those did the IOA and SAB. Moreover, in com-
parison with two recently proposed methods, the proposed TPC took only 21% CPU times as those did the GA and ALA.
For the third set of initial signal settings, as it is seen in Table 4, the proposed TPC achieved the best performance with the
value of $975, which appreciably improved the initial performance index by 58.35%. Conventional methods like IOA and SAB
also improved the performance index by 49% and 54%. The recently proposed methods: ALA and GA, respectively, improved
the performance index nearly by 54.46% and 54.76%. Concerning the computational efﬁcacy of solution methods, again, the
proposed TPC took 26% and 38% CPU times as those did the IOA and SAB. Also, in comparison with two recently proposed
S.-W. Chiou / Applied Mathematical Modelling 35 (2011) 650–666 659
methods, the proposed TPC, respectively, took only 21% and 20% CPU times as those did ALA and GA. Regarding the conver-
gence rate for the proposed TPC method, as it can be seen in Fig. 3, travel costs remained decreasing as the solution algorithm
proceeds for three distinct sets of initial data. Because the area trafﬁc control optimization problem is non-convex with re-
spect to the signal settings and capacity expansions, the local optima can be found when the relative difference in the objec-
tive function value is less than 0.1%. As it can be apparently seen from Tables 2–4, the standard deviation of three initial data
for the proposed TPC (stdev = 2) is much less than those for ALA (stdev = 50.5) and GA (stdev = 32.3).

methods can also be found. As it was also summarized in Table 6, the proposed TPC achieved rather better performance
as compared to recently proposed ALA and GA methods by 5% and nearly 3% for 81/144/16/8/16 grid-size example network.
For large-scale grid-size example network with combination of 256/480/36/50/100, the proposed TPC method also slightly
outperformed ALA and GA in total travel cost reduction by nearly 1% and 2% and saved much more computational efforts in
CPU times as compared to those did the ALA and GA methods.
5. Conclusions and further issues
In this paper, we presented a novel solution for a non-linear inequality constrained area trafﬁc capacity control system
with elastic equilibrium ﬂows. Since this area trafﬁc control optimization problem with respect to signal settings and link
capacity expansions are non-convex, only local optima can be found. Computational tests were hence performed using a real
data Sioux Falls city network and various grid-size example networks demonstrating and quantifying the effectiveness and
computational efﬁcacy of the proposed method and other well-known solution methods. As it can be seen from numerical
results, the proposed method has shown signiﬁcant improvements in travel cost reduction with far less computational over-
heads when compared to other alternatives. The solution quality of the proposed TPC method was also demonstrated by the
convergence curve where total travel costs were monotonically decreasing until local optimum was found. In order to test
the applicability of proposed solution method to large-scale networks, various grid-size example networks were employed.
As it was reported, the numerical computations were satisfactory. Considering time-varying trafﬁc demands and dynamic
trafﬁc control signal settings, further issues like solving a non-linear inequality constrained area trafﬁc control system with
time-varying delays are being taken into account. We will discuss this issue in a subsequent paper.
