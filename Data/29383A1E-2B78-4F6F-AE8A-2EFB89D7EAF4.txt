Abstract 
CO2-to-CH3OH hydrogenation reaction is one of the promising solutions not only to 
reduce the global warming impact by the elimination of greenhouse gases but also produce 
valuable chemicals directly from carbon dioxide.  In this study, semiconductor Zn:CuInS2 
nanoarrays were synthesized by template-assisted chemical bath deposition (CBD).  The 
crystalline and morphology of the arrays were characterized by means of X-ray Diffraction 
(XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).  XRD results show that main peak of CuInS2 
shifts to the higher angles when the doping concentrations of Zn increase.  As molar ratios of Zn 
in the bath solution were higher than 0.4, the semiconductor property of the sample changed 
from n-type to p-type from Hall measurement.  The carrier densities of the Zn:CuInS2 arrays 
were found to be in the range of 1.32×1017 ~ 9.45×1020 cm-3. The maximum photocurrent density 
was 2.02 mA/cm2 for the p-type CuInS2 arrays with Zn-doped molar ratios of 0.4.  To further 
investigate the reaction mechanisms, water isotopes of D2O, and H218O were applied as the tracer 
of water molecules. Time-dependent solid phase reactions were monitored by the Diffuse 
Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectroscopy (DRIFT). Additionally, the Quadrupole 
Mass Spectroscopy (QMS) accompanied with gas chromatograph (GC) was used for the gas 
phase analysis.  The maximal methanol production rate during the photocatalysis was found to be 
0.032 M/hr, which is better than that of the referenced CBD film (0.003 M/hr) prepared in the 
same compositions.

2. Experimental  
2.1. Materials 
Copper chloride (CuCl2·2H2O, 99% purity, company), indium trichloride (InCl3, purity, 
company), thioacetamide (CH3CSNH2 (TAA), 99% purity, company), and zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2, 
purity, company) were used as the sources of Cu2+, In3+, S2- and Zn2+ ions, respectively. 
Triethanolamine (C6H15NO3 (TEA), purity, company) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, purity, 
company) were used as a complexing agent and a buffer, respectively. HClO4 (69~72%, J.T. 
Baker) and CH3(CH2)3OCH2CH2OH (99%, First Chemical manufacture Co.) were used as 
etchants in the process of electrical polishing. Oxalic acid (H2C2O4, purity, company), 
phosphoric acid (H3PO4, 85%, Nihon Shiyaku Industrie) and chromic acid (H2CrO4, 85%, Nihon 
Shiyaku Industrie) were used as etchants in the process of wet-etching. 
 
2.2. Preparation of AAO template 
Aluminum sheets of 0.1 mm thickness were cut into 3×3 cm2 substrates. The surface of 
substrates was cleaned by deionized water and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath for 60 min. The 
substrates were then annealed in the N2 atmosphere at 400 0C for 2 h. The substrate was 
electrically polished in a mixture with 40 vol% HClO4, 40 vol% H2SO4 and 20 vol% H2O at 
voltage of 40 V DC and 180 mA/cm2 for 10 min to provide a smooth surface, and rinsed with 
deionized water. Then, clean substrates were anodized at an external voltage of 40 V DC in 0.27 
M C2H2O4 for 40 min. Subsequently, the substrate was immersed in a 1.8 wt% H2CrO4: 6 wt% 
H3PO4 aqueous solution for 40 min to remove the aluminum oxide films from in the first-time 
anodization on the surface of aluminum sheets. Same anodized procedure was repeated twice to 
achieve the ordered-AAO templates. 
 
2.3. Fabrication of Zn:CuInS2 nanotube arrays 
The Zn-doped CuInS2 nanotube arrays were prepared from the chemical solutions of 
CuCl2·2H2O (0.4M, 1.11 mL), InCl3 (0.4M, 1.11 mL), TAA (7.4M, 0.56 mL) and various 
volumes of 0.4M Zn(NO3)2 solutions.  The molar ratios and a calculated crystallite size of the 
CuInS2 and Zn:CuInS2 samples are presented in the Table 1.  In the following step, C6H15NO3 
solution (7.4 M) and NH4NO3 solutions (0.4M) were added together for the preparation of 
copper and indium complexes.  The mixture solution was maintained in pH 1.35 at 80 0C to 
avoid the precipitation of hydroxide-complexes [27].  During the chemical bath deposition, the 
cations and anions in the deposition solution react with each other and become neutral molecules 
[28].  If the reaction proceeds too fast, the precipitates will occur in the solution before they 
deposited on the substrate.  Thus, the complexing agents such as NH3 and TEA was used to slow 
down the precipitation and enable the formation of Zn-doped CuInS2 on substrates [29].  Sample 
(a) was the pure CuInS2 and (b), (c), (d), and (e) were CuInS2 doped with various Zn 
concentrations.  Then, as-prepared AAO template substrate was placed in the chemical bath for 
10 min.

irradiated to the see-through window of the DRIFTS cell.  Its photon intensity was measured as 4 
mW/cm2 at 2 cm away from the tip of the wand.  
 
3. Results and discussion  
3.1. Crystallinity and microstructure analysis 
  Based on the SEM micrographs, nanorod arrays were 2.0 µm long with diameters ranging 
from 60 to 70 nm and a length of 1.5 µm as shown in Figure 1.  Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns 
of as-prepared pure CuInS2 and Zn:CuInS2 arrays.   The diffraction peaks fitted to the bulk 
crystal structure of CuInS2 (JCPDS 00-015-0681).  Furthermore, a shift of the main peak to a 
higher 2θ angle was noticed in the samples with the increasing Zn concentrations.  This can be 
explained by an intrinsic defect of the crystal structure by Zn. Similar tendency was reported by 
Ohasi et al. that the replacement of In3+ by Ga3+ ions in the CuInS2 crystal lattice caused the shift 
of the XRD main peak [30].

3.2. Electrical properties  
Flat band potential of the as-prepared arrays was determined using )(2 λPBIFBEE =− , derived 
for small band bending, where )(2 λPI  is the monochromatic photocurrent density, and E is the 
applied voltage [31].  In this study, the incident light wavelength was 800 nm and the applied 
voltages V was scanned from -1 to +1 V.  The measurements were carried out in 0.5 M K2SO4 
electrolyte solutions with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.  The intercept of the onset line at the 
zero photocurrent density was considered as the flat band potential.  The values of flat-band 
potential (VVB) of the as-prepared samples are in the range of -0.50 V to -0.10 V (NHE) for n-
type compounds, and that of p-type samples are in the range of 0.23 V to 0.43 V (NHE) as 
summarized in Table 2.  The value of flat-band potential becomes more positive for the samples 
with increasing Zn contents in the solution.  Furthermore, the potential of the conduction band 
(VCB) was calculated from the VFB and the Femi-Dirac distribution function [32].  Subsequently, 
the potential of the valance band (VVB) can be determined from the on-set band of the absorption 
spectra and the value of VCB.  Furthermore, the carrier densities of CuInS2 nanorod arrays are in 
the range of 1.32×10

cm-3 by Hall measurement.  This value increases with the 
increasing Zn concentrations.

Figure 5 Photocatalytic CH3OH evolution from various CuInS2 arrays in bubbling CO2 in H2O. 
 
The sample (e) shows the highest methanol production rate, since it has the highest 
photocurrent and the highest quantum efficiency among all as-prepared arrays.  The physical and 
electrical properties of the Zn:CuInS2 arrays are summarized in Table 2. The resistivity of the Zn: 
CuInS2 arrays decreased from 19.51 Ω cm to 0.43 Ω cm as increasing Zn concentration. The 
increase of electrical conductance can be mainly attributed to the donor-type defects caused by 
the substitution of Zn atoms at Cu and In sites.  The increases of electrical conductance and the 
enchantment of photocatalytic activity were due to the facts that the dopant Zn effectively 
reduced the recombination rate of the electrons and holes and thus extended the lifetime of the 
exciting state.  Besides, the Zn-doped CuInS2 arrays reduced the work function and the barrier 
height of the Schottky layer.  As a consequence, the addition of Zn dopants favored the reduction 
of contact resistance, which in turn led to an increase of the photocurrent and accelerated the 
photocatalytic reaction [33].  
 
3.3. The verification of photocatalytic reaction by DRIFT and Mass spectrometer 
  To further verify the formation of methanol occurred on photocatalysts, water isotopes of 
H2O, D2O, and H218O were used to identify the intermediates and reaction mechanism of 
photocatalysis.  Figure 6 shows the FTIR spectra collected upon the procedure of dehydration, 
CO2 saturation and light irradiation.  Sample (e) initially showed no OH stretching vibration at 
3400-4000 cm-1, which confirmed that all adsorbed water was removed from the sample.  Then, 
after added a drop of water and introduced CO2 on the surface of the dehydrated sample (e) with 
the area of 0.5 cm2, absorption peaks at 3000~3700 cm-1 and 2340 cm-1 assigned as OH 
stretching vibration and linearly adsorbed CO2 were noticeable, respectively.  When LED light 
(545 nm) irradiated on the sample accompanied with the nitrogen as purging gas, peaks at 1454, 
1473, and 3700 cm-1, attributed to δ(CH3), ν-OH, HCOO appeared.  Whereas the intensity of

4. Conclusions 
In this study, CuInS2 nanorod arrays were prepared using the chemical-bath-deposition 
method.  The structural, electrical and optical properties of the arrays were investigated.  The 
XRD patterns demonstrate that the CuInS2 tetragonal phase was the major crystalline phase.  The
