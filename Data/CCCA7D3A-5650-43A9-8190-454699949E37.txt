PART I: SURFACE MODIFICATION ON THE VARIOUS PHBHHX MEMBRANES 
VIA INDUCED-GRAFT COPOLYMERIZATION 
 
ABSTRACT   
 Surface modification of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co -3-hydroxyhexanoate) membranes was performed via 
induced-graft copolymerization. Three kinds of membranes were prepared by using compression-molding, 
electrospinning, and casting methods. Difference surface morphology, structure, and crystallinity of materials 
were made. There were two kinds of surface pre-treatment: atmospheric pressure plasma and ozone treatments 
on the surface of membranes and then induced-graft with acrylic acid. According to the observation of water 
contact angle and morphology results, the membranes had good wettability and roughness due to the 
poly(acrylic acid) grafted on the surface. Because electrospun membranes had distinctive properties, such as 
high surface area-to-volume ratio and high porosity, the grafting density of the poly-(acrylic acid) was higher 
than that of other membranes.    
Keywords: PHBHHx, surface modification, acrylic acid, graft 
 
Introduction 
Polyhydoxyalkanoates (PHAs) are 
biodegradable thermoplastic polyesters, and they are 
produced as energy storage by some microorganisms 
under unbalanced growth conditions 1. The PHAs 
material shows some advantages such as good 
biodegradability, biocompatibility, and nontoxic. 
One of PHAs family poly(3-hydroxy- 
butyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) 
copolymer  presents better properties than 
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) and 
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvarlerate) 
(PHBV) in terms of mechanical and biocompatible 
properties 1, 2. However, PHBHHx is lacked of 
functional groups to bind another molecular 
covalently. Several approaches have been employed 
to overcome functionalization properties on the 
surface of PHBHHx   in order to improve its 
biomedical application 3, 4. In order to enhance the 
degree of functionalization, surface pre-treatment has 
been used to provide free radicals for feasibility of 
functional groups grafting on the membrane surface. 
 In this study, three kinds of membrane 
preparation techniques, such as compression-molding, 
electrospinning, and casting were employed. The 
surface morphology of membranes performed either 
dense or porous. The semi-crystalline PHBHHx 
membranes showed different crystal structures and 
arrangements through different preparation 
techniques 5. In this study, two kinds of the surface 
modification method were used for pre-treatment, 
including ozone and atmospheric pressure plasma. 
The aim of this study is to graft carboxyl groups 
grafting on various PHBHHx membranes surface via 
different approaches of pre-treatment. After that, the 
carboxyl groups can immobilize some particular 
macromolecular for giving a wide range of 
biomedical application in future. 
 
Experimental 
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoat
e) (PHBHHx) was donated as powder form from 
Procter & Gamble Co. (U.S.A). The 3-hydroxy- 
hexanoate (3HHx) content of PHBHHx was 8.3 
mol%. The weight-average molecular weight (Mw) 
and the polydispersity index (PDI) determined by 
GPC are 837,000 g/mol and 2, respectively. The 
melting temperature measured by DSC is 144 oC and 
glass transition temperature is -3 oC. 
PHBHHx membranes were prepared by 
compression-molding, casting and electrospinning. 
Thermal-pressed membranes were made by a 
compression molding apparatus (Gotech GT-7014) 
under a pressure of 9.8 MPa at 150°C for 15 min. 
The cast membranes were prepared by casting on a 
glass dish with 4 wt% PHBHHx/chloroform solution 
at room temperature. The fibrous membranes were 
fabricated by electrospinning method. In 
eletrospinning process, the PHBHHx polymer was 
dissolved in co-solvent (chloroform/DMF (80:20) 
with 5 wt% concentration. The operation conditions 
of the electrospinning were at 18 kV, 40°C, 25 cm of 
the working distance, 1,500 rpm of rotating rate, and 
1.0 ml/h of feeding rate continuously to collect fibers 
over 10 hours. The crystallinity of the membranes 
was calculated by XRD pattern.  
The surface pre-treatment of the membranes 
was carried out by atmospheric pressure plasma and 
ozone treatment. The PHBHHx membranes were 
exposed to the atmosphere plasma on 100 W of RF 
plasma power, 10 slm of Ar flow rate, and 2.5 mm of 
work distant from glow discharge to substrate for 180 
seconds. For ozone treatment, the membranes were 
exposed with ozone for 60 min and 1 L/min ozone 
flow rate. After pre-treatment, the membranes were 
immersed in 20 wt% acrylic acid (AAc) solution with 
0.0278g FeSO4 at 60°C for 4 h. The wettability and 
carboxyl group density of the membranes were 
analyzed by water contact angle and TBO stain. 
FESEM was used to examine the surface 
morphology of the membranes.

PART II. THE PHASE SEPARATION AND CRYSTALLINE BEHAVIOR OF 
PHBHHX/PLLA IN BLENDED ELECTROSPUN FIBERS 
 
ABSTRACT The blended membranes of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx)/ 
poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) in various compositions were fabricated by electrospinning and casting. The specific 
effects of electrospinning, such as the fast solvent evaporation, stress on the fibers due to electric field, and fiber 
size limitation, could result in the differences in chain packing, phase separation, and limited crystallinity of the 
blends of PHBHHx/PLLA. Those membranes were characterized by WAXS, SAXS, DSC, and FESEM. 
According to those results, a model of the chain packing in electrospun fibers of PHBHHx/PLLA blends could 
be constructed. The highly orientated amorphous and crystalline phase existed near the fibrous surface, and a 
less orientated domain existed in the center, and an amorphous PLLA-rich phase existed between the outer shell 
and the inner center core of blend fibers. 
 
Introduction 
Electrospinning has received lots of attention 
because it could produce ultrafine fibers with 
diameter in the range of several micros to tens of 
nanometers. Electrospun nanofibers have several 
interesting properties such as high surface 
area-to-volume ratio, high porosity, and enhanced 
mechanical properties.1 Electrospinning has been 
largely developed and applied in recent decades such 
as nano-sensors, electronic/optical industrial 
applications, cosmetic skin masks, military body 
armor, filtration media, drug delivery, scaffolds for 
tissue engineering etc.1-5 The nano-diameter limited 
effect and the electron field shear stress are 
interesting issues for further study as they affect 
polymer chain-packing.6-8  
 Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of 
biological polyesters produced by microorganisms 
under unbalanced growth conditions and has great 
potential in commercial applications because of its 
biodegradability and biocompatibility.9 The earliest 
discovered and most extensively studied PHA is 
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). However, the 
application of PHB is relatively limited due to its 
brittleness caused by its high crystallinity and second 
crystallization behavior. 10  
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy-hexanoat
e) (PHBHHx) has substantially different behavior 
compared to PHB due to long chain branching, 
which reduces the crystallinity and melting 
temperature, and results in a polymer with better 
ductile and processing properties than PHB.11  
Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable 
polymer produced from L-lactic acid. It is a highly 
versatile material and is made from 100% renewable 
resources like corn, sugar beets, wheat and other 
starch-rich products. PLA is a versatile polymer that 
has many potential uses, including many applications 
in the textile and medical industries as well as in the 
packaging industry. Therefore, there are lots of 
studies discussed PLA concerning thermal properties, 
crystallization12, and applied studies concerning 
improvement of thermal and mechanical properties 
and applications for tissue engineering and so on13. 
In this article, blends of PLLA and PHBHHx 
were prepared by solution mixing, and then, the 
membrane would be fabricated by two processes: 
electrospinning and casting. The diameter of 
electrospun fiber is under the micrometer, thus, the 
dispersion of two polymers might be different than 
casting. The aim of this study is to discuss the 
miscibility, chain packing and phase separation 
behavior of crystalline/crystalline blend of two 
common biopolymers in electrospinng and casting 
process. 
 
Experimental 
Material 
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) 
(HHx contain 3.9% determined by 1H NMR spectra) 
was obtained from Procter and Gamble (West 
Chester, MO, USA) as a gift. PLLA (2002D) 
purchased from Nature Work (Blair, USA). The 
weight-average molecular weight (   ) of PHBHHx 
and PLLA were 570,000 and 270,000; the 
polydispersity index (PDI) were 1.31 and 1.62, 
respectively, measured by GPC.  Chloroform was 
from Mallinckrodt (Hazelwood, USA) and N, 
N-dimethyl- formamide (DMF) was from Tedia 
(Fairfield, USA).  
 
Sample preparation 
PHBHHx and PLLA were dissolved in 
chloroform (CHCl3)/dimethylformamide (DMF) with 
different ratios and desired concentrations. The ratio 
of PHBHHx/PDLLA is 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 
(w/w). The co-solvent ratio of CHCl3/DMF is 5/1 by 
weight. The electrospinning instrument consisted of a 
syringe pump (Cole-Parmer, EK-74900-00, USA), an 
adjustable, regulated, high-voltage power supply (up 
to 40 kV, You-Shang Technical Co., Taiwan), a 
temperature controlled oven, and collector units. The 
polymer solution was filled in a glass syringe which 
was connected to a stainless steel spinneret 
(Hamilton, inner diameter: 0.41 mm). The syringe 
was placed in a syringe pump and the needle 
connected to the positive end of a high voltage power 
supply set at 20 kV, and the temperature of the 
system was controlled at 40ºC. The fibers were 
collected onto a grounded plate which was covered 
by an aluminum foil with the collection distance of 
25 cm, and the solution feeding rate was set at 0.5 
ml/h. Approximate 6 h processing time would be 
needed to produce a nanofibrous membrane. As

under the scattering curves. The bulk crystallinity 
versus the content of PLLA in the blends was shown 
in Fig 4.  
In cast membranes, the bulk crystallinity of neat 
PHBHHx increased slightly, but that of neat PLLA 
increased significantly after annealing. It indicated 
that PHBHHx could crystallize almost completely at 
the room temperature. If the phase separation would 
be occurred so that the two polymers could be 
separated completely and formed its crystalline 
structure without interrupt. The ideal bulk 
crystallinity is an expect value to show the blend 
without interrupt. Before annealing, the bulk 
crystallinity of blend was higher than the ideal bulk 
crystallinity of PHBHHx. The phase separation 
behavior induced the molecular chain of PHBHHx to 
form its crystalline structure, and then the little 
amount of crystallite of PLLA enhanced the total 
bulk crystallinity. After annealing, the bulk 
crystallinity of blend was lower the sum of ideal 
crystallinity indicating the effect of dilution effect. 
The increased bulk crystallinity of the 
electrospun membranes after annealing was more 
than that of cast membranes. It was another evidence 
to prove that the phase separation was near complete 
in the cast membranes of the blends, thus the 
molecular chains could form crystalline structure 
easily even without annealing. In contrast, polymer 
chains of two polymers might still be mixed after fast 
solvent evaporation, and the formation of crystalline 
structure was restricted in the electrospun membranes. 
Moreover, the molecular chains were orientated in 
the direction of fibers, thus the molecular chains 
could be crystallized easily and the crystallinity 
would be much enhanced after annealing treatment. 
 
Lamellar structure 
The SAXS patterns of the cast membranes 
before and after annealing are shown in Fig. 5.1a and 
5.1b, respectively. A broad peak could be observed at 
q around 0.95 nm-1 (qmax), and it was reported that it 
was due to the long period of PHB14. When PLLA 
was present in the blend, a minor peak or a shoulder 
was found at q around 0.3 nm-1. The minor peak or 
shoulder indicated the lamellar structure of PLLA15. 
It was proposed that the molecular chains or loosely 
arranged crystallites of PLLA would be rearranged to 
form more orderly lamellar structure after annealing. 
In addition, the lower q value indicated the long 
period of PLLA was larger than that of PHBHHx. 
Fig. 5.2a and 5.2b display the SAXS results of 
electrospun membranes before and after annealing, 
respectively. there was no peak due to PLLA found in 
the SAXS spectra of the electrospun fibers before 
and after annealing. The PLLA peak might be buried 
by the high intensity peak due to the directly 
transmitted X-ray through the porous electrospun 
membranes.  Nevertheless, the formation of 
lamellar structure for PLLA in electrospun 
membranes were largely restricted due to the size 
effect of the fiber diameters.  Even neat PLLA 
fibers didn’t show the scattering peak in the SAXS 
pattern.   
 
Phase separation behavior 
The cross-sectioned morphology of the etched 
fibers is shown in Fig. 6. It was noticed that the 
cross-section of the fibers showed a concave 
morphology with or without a hard core in the center. 
Based on the observed morphology and the 
information obtained from DSC, WAXS, and SAXS, 
a model of the molecular chain packing and physical 
structure in the electrospun PHBHHx/PLLA blend 
fibers is proposed in Scheme 1. Where a shell of 
highly orientated amorphous and crystalline phases 
existed near the surface; and a less orientated domain 
consisted of amorphous and crystalline phases 
existed in the center, and an amorphous PLLA-rich 
phase existed between the outer shell and the inner 
center core of blend fibers. 
Conclusions 
According to the results of DSC, WAXS, 
SAXS, and the morphology observation of fibers 
after etching, a model of the structure and molecular 
packing in the electrospun fibers could be 
constructed. The highly orientated domain consisted 
of amorphous and crystalline phase existed near the 
fibrous surface, and a less orientated domain existed 
in the center, and an amorphous PLLA-rich phase 
existed between the outer shell and the inner center 
core of blend fibers. The chain packing of 
PHBHHx/PLLA in electrospun fiber is significantly 
different from that in cast membranes. 
In addition, the hydrolysis morphology, 
lamellar structure, and crystalline structure in 
electrospun fibers were affected by the partial mixed 
amorphous phase. This specific chain packing 
behavior in electrospun fiber might affect the 
degradation rate. The degradation rate of electrospun 
blended fiber was affected by the composition and by 
chain packing, even if the blend system was 
immiscible.

C=O groups in PHBV. Thus, it can demonstrate that the 
hydrogen interaction between ZnO and C=O groups in 
PHBV is stronger then –OH end and C=O in polymer. 
The DSC results are summarized in Table 1 and Fig 4. 
In the 1st heating (Fig. 4a), it is found that Tm does not 
significantly change before and after adding ZnO NPs. 
Thus it confirms that ZnO NPs do not influence the 
crystalline structure of PHBV. During the cooling run 
(Fig. 4b), A small crystallization peak around 45 oC is 
found for the composite. It further demonstrates the 
retarding effect of ZnO NPs in the melt crystallization. In 
2nd heating (Fig. 4c), dual melting peaks appear. The 
multiple melting peaks can arise from melting- 
recrystallization-remelting (mrr) during the heating run. 
It is widely accepted that the crystallinity of the polymer 
matrix will increase through adding nanomaterials which 
serve as nucleating agent (Tang et. al, 2004). However, in 
this study, the crystallinity of the electrospun PHBV 
fibers does not increase but decreases after adding ZnO 
NPs. This unusual phenomenon is mainly ascribed to two 
factors: the special crystalline structure of PHBV and the 
interaction between the two components.  
TEM images of the composite fibers are presented in 
Fig. 5. Dispersion of ZnO NPs in the electrospun fibers 
is quite well. There is no serious agglomeration of ZnO 
NPs in the polymer. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The basic crystalline structure of the PHBV is not 
influenced by the NPs. However, the interaction of 
hydrogen bonds between ZnO NPs and PHBV hinders 
the crystallization of the latter. The effect of 
hydrogen-bonding interaction between the hydrophilic 
surface of inorganic NPs and the polar groups of the 
polymers should be carefully examined although the 
polymers themselves are considered hydrophobic.

(FFVs) are showed in Fig. 2 and they decreased with 
the isothermal crystallization temperature (Tc). The 
FFVs of the cold-crystalline membranes are larger than 
the melt-crystalline membranes prepared at the same 
crystallization temperature. 
The sorption isotherms of water vapor in various 
PHBV membranes at 35oC are showed in Fig. 3. The 
isotherms show an explicit upturn at higher activities 
because the clustering of the water molecules inside  
the polymer matrix. The amounts of water sorption in 
all the cold-crystallized samples were higher than that 
in the melt-crystallized ones at the same crystallization 
temperature because the cold-crystallized samples had 
more FFV.  Water vapor diffusivity in polymer matrix 
were determined by the initial slope method according 
to the Fick’s second law and the results are showed in 
Fig. 4. The diffusivity of all cold-crystallized PHBV 
membranes was higher than melt-crystallized ones with 
same crystallization temperature. The results agreed 
with the results of sorption amount at the same activity 
because the cold crystallized membranes contained 
more FFV. The water plasticization and clustering 
phenomenon affected the diffusivity in polymer matrix. 
The diffusivity increased initially with the sorption 
amount due to the swelling effect of the water sorption.  
However, the diffusivity decreased at higher vapor 
activities since the clustering of water molecules in the 
polymer matrix would reduce the rate of diffusion 
(Miguel and Iruin,1999). The swelling effect was 
stronger than clustering at lower activities but the 
clustering phenomenon prevailed at higher activities. 
The diffusivity of PHBV membranes increased with 
activity first and then decreased due to the swelling and 
clustering effects. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The crystalline structure and water transport 
properties have been investigated for PHBV 
membranes prepared at various isothermal 
crystallization conditions. The cold-crystallization 
process formed more amorphous region (i.e. more FFV) 
so that water transport was favored. Because the 
molecular chains could move and rearrange easily at 
the higher crystallized temperatures, the crystallinity 
increased accordingly. The thermal history would 
affect the crystalline structure, free volume properties 
and water transport properties of membranes directly.

Preparation of cast PLLA films 
Solvent-casting method was adopted for preparing 
PLLA films.  9 wt% PLLA in chloroform was cast on 
glass dishes at room temperature for 48 hr to allow 
complete evaporation of the solvent.  
 
Hydrolysis of cast PLLA films 
Hydrolytic studies were performed in phosphate 
buffer at 37 oC. After hydrolysis for predetermined time, 
the samples were taken out and then dried by 
freeze-drying.  
 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
Crystallinities of cast PLLA films were measured 
using an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu, XRD-6000), 
with Ni-filtered Cu radiation generated with 40 kV and 
30 mA as the X-ray source. The diffraction angles were 
determined at a range of 5~40o 2θ angle at a rate of 1 
o/min with a step size of 0.1o. 
 
Positron annihilation spectroscopy and slow positron 
beam 
Positron annihilation lifetime spectra were measured 
using a conventional fast-fast coincident timing 
spectrometer at 25 oC. The positron source, 22Na is 
commercially available as aqueous solution of 22NaCl 
(Isotope Products Laboratory, Burbank, USA). The 20 
µCi activity positron source containing 22Na isotope was 
enveloped in two 6 µm thickness kapton foils. Cast 
PLLA films were stacked to about 500 µm and the 22Na 
positron source was sandwiched between two polymer 
stacks. Each lifetime spectrum containing two million 
counts was obtained in about 2 hours.  
In the slow positron beam measurement, the vacuum 
in the sample chamber was approximately 10-8 torr.  
The energy of positrons was adjusted between 0 to 30 
KeV.  The corresponding depth of the free volume 
locations was from 0 to 7 µm.  
Results and Discussion 
 
Bulk free volume properties 
In the conventional PALS study of hydrolyzed PLLA 
films, the o-Ps lifetime and the intensity of o-Ps were 
observed.  Both properties changed with degradation 
time, and the results are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, 
respectively.  According to the formula FFV = CVfI3, 
FFV changed with degradation time and the results are 
shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 with the crystallinity and the 
weight average molecular weight, respectively.  The 
degradation can be divided into 3 stages.  In the early 
stage of hydrolysis, the molecular weight decreased 
slightly; the crystallinity increased due to the 
enhancement of polymer chains mobility by water 
sorption, and resulted in the decrease of FFV.  In the 
second stage, the molecular weight dropped and the 
chain packing loosed, so that the FFV increased. At last, 
the crystallinity increased and the FFV decreased again 
since the remaining short chains rearranged in the third 
stage. 
 
Depth profile of free volume by slow positron beam 
When positrons entering the polymer matrix, they 
would localize at different depth due to the magnitude of 
their kinetic energy, which is an adjustable parameter in 
the measurement.  The depth profile of the 
corresponding S-parameters was observed and is shown 
in Fig. 5.  After hydrolysis for 21 weeks, the 
S-parameters near the surface layer were lower than that 
of the bulk PLLA film.  The thickness of the degraded 
layer could, therefore, be estimated as 1.38 µm.   
 
Conclusions 
Bulk free volume properties of hydrolyzed PLLA 
films was measured and correlated to the changes of 
molecular weight and crystallinity during hydrolysis 
process successfully. According to the depth profile of 
free volume after hydrolysis, the layer of degradation 
was determined by using a powerful slow positron 
beam-PALS technique.  In a long-term hydrolysis, the 
degradation behavior, degradation rate, and mechanism 
of degradation of PLLA films will be studied by this 
novel PALS technique.

計畫成果自評 
 
本研究為「永續性生物聚酯高分子之開發與其應用」兩年計畫，進行生物可降解之高分
子材料的生產發展與應用性開發。從膜材的表面改質、膜材的熱處理、有機無機材料的複合，
以及兩種不同高分子的摻混。大部分的研究內容與原計畫相符，完成的工作項目與成果自評
如下： 
 
一、高分子薄膜之奈米纖維的改良： 
本計畫中，利用電紡絲技術，成功製備 Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) 
(PHBHHx)電紡膜。利用表面改質的技術，成功地在電紡膜材表面，接枝上丙烯酸，進而改變
了電紡膜材的表面性質，增益了其親水性，利於生物培養，為一良好的生物支架材料。後續
已完成 in vivo 的生物測試，證明其相容性良好。本部分的論文正在繕寫中，將會提出發表。 
此 外 ， 也 成 功 地 製 備 poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) 與
poly(L-Lactic acid)PLLA 兩種半結晶高分子之摻混電紡膜材。經由 X-ray 繞射儀的結果中可發
現，兩種材料的結晶行為並不會互相干擾。但是從小角度 X 光散射儀中，卻可以發現摻混過
後的膜材，因為添加了另一個高分子的關係，反而致使 PHBHHx 的晶板增厚的效應。而在經
由鹼性溶液水解的結果中，可以進一步推測出兩種高分子在纖維中分佈與排列。本部分的研
究成果正在繕寫論文中，將會提出發表。 
另一方面，利用自製的氧化鋅奈米粒子，與 PHBV 所製成的奈米纖維膜材，由於氧化鋅
奈米粒子的表面，會帶有許多羥基，而這些羥基會干擾 PHBV 結晶中之氫鍵的緣故，造成此
複合的奈米纖維的結晶度、結晶速率都有些微的下降，此一結果與過去認為奈米粒子可以形
成高分子材料的晶核，明顯地不同。此部分的研究，已刊登於 Polymer, 51, 2403-2409 (2010)。 
此一系列的研究顯示出，PHAs 系列的電紡膜材，其本身的結晶性質會受到電紡的製程、
摻混、有機無機複合所影響，此一系列結果可以說明，PHAs 系列材料的電紡膜材，在改質方
面，具有相當大的潛力。 
 
二、生物高分子膜材之輸送行為： 
 利用熔融以及冷結晶製備半結晶性之 (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), 
PHBV)薄膜，觀測其薄膜的水輸送性質。吸附實驗的結果也顯示水在高分子薄膜內會聚集並
以團塊的方式存在於 PHBV 薄膜中。在較高的水活性中，水聚集的現象不論是對於熔融結晶
以及是冷結晶製備的薄膜皆會降其低薄膜內水的擴散速率。利用修正後的自由體積定律成功
地描繪出相對自由體積(FFV)以及結晶度對水的擴散係數影響。本部分的研究成果正在繕寫論
文中，將會提出發表。 
 此一部分的研究，顯示出 PHBV 本身對於水的吸附與輸送行為。期望此一研究結果，可
以在未來當 PHBV 應用於包裝材料時，成為在工業界上重要的依據。
