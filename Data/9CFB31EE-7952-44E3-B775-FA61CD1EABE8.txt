dried ﬁlm. By repeating the dipping and heating steps, other
dried ﬁlms with three, ﬁve and ten times of dip-coating
deposition were prepared. Finally, these dried ﬁlms with
diﬀerent number of dip-coating times were annealed in air at
480 C for 1 h to crystallize them. The annealed ﬁlms were
kept in the furnace until cooling to room temperature.
The optical spectrum of the ZnO ﬁlms was evaluated in
the wavelength region between 200 and 800 nm using UV/
vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-1240). The crystalline state
of the ﬁlms was examined using XRD analysis (Mac Science
MPX3) with an X-ray source (Cu K incident radiation,
40 kV and 30mA) at a scan speed of 2.0min1. The surface
characteristics and thickness of the oxide ﬁlms were
measured using FE-SEM (JEOL JSM-6700 F) system
operated at 3.0 kV, and the composition of these ﬁlms was
analyzed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) system attached to the FE-SEM system. The micro-
structure and grain size of the ﬁlms were investigated using
TEM (JEM 1200EX II) system operated at 120 kV.
3. Results and Discussion
The main crystalline phases and possible orientation of
crystallites in the ﬁlms were determined by XRD analysis.
The XRD spectra of the dried (100 C, 1 h) and annealed
(480 C, 1 h) ﬁlms are shown in Fig. 1. No diﬀraction peaks
appeared for the dried ﬁlm without the annealing treatment,
as shown in Fig. 1(a); however, all the ﬁlms showed a
crystalline ZnO phase with a hexagonal wurtzite structure
after the annealing treatment. For the ZnO ﬁlms prepared
with 1, 3, 5, and 10 times of dip coating, three main peaks of
the (100), (002), and (101) planes with small peaks of the
(102), (110), (103), and (112) planes were observed in the
XRD pattern, as shown in Figs. 1(b)–1(e), respectively. The
relative intensities of the three main peaks [(100), (002), and
(101) planes] of the ZnO ﬁlms are dependent on the number
of dip-coating times.
The degrees of [100], [002], and [101] orientations of
the ZnO ﬁlms could be estimated from the intensity ratio of
the main diﬀraction peaks of the ZnO thin ﬁlms to the
corresponding ZnO JCPDS (80-0074) data ð½hklsample=
½hklJCPDSÞ. The ﬁlms prepared with 1, 3, and 5 times of dip
coating showed an intensity ratio of ½002sample=½002JCPDS,
which is higher than those of ½100sample=½100JCPDS and
½101sample=½101JCPDS. This result suggests that the depos-
ited ZnO ﬁlms display a preferred [002] orientation
compared with the randomly distributed ZnO crystals of
JCPDS. However, when increasing the number of times of
dip coating to 10, the resulting ﬁlm showed reduced [002]
alignment and gave a higher degree of preferred [101]
orientation similarly to that of natural ZnO crystals. The
relative intensities of the diﬀraction peaks of the ZnO thin
ﬁlms, and the degrees of preferred orientation are summa-
rized in Table I.
The average grain size of the ZnO ﬁlms can be calculated
using Scherrer’s formula,17) D ¼ 0:9= cos , where  is
the X-ray wavelength,  the full width half maximum
(FWHM) of the diﬀraction line and  the diﬀraction angle.
Table II shows the results obtained from the (002) and (101)
diﬀraction peaks.

the ﬁlm consisted of ﬁne nanocrystallites and large crystal-
lites, and large crystallites as large as approximately 600 nm
can be clearly observed in Fig. 4(a). Figures 4(c) and 4(d)
show bright and dark ﬁeld enlarged images of the ﬁne
crystallites, whose grain size distribution is 20 nm. The
grain size of the ﬁne crystallites measured from the TEM
images also corresponds to that obtained using Sherrer’s
formula from XRD spectra, as shown in Table II. The results
of XRD and TEM evidence that the ﬁne polycrystallites at
the bottom of the ﬁlm are responsible for the observed
boarding of the XRD peaks.18)
Figure 4(e) shows the selected area diﬀraction (SAD)
pattern taken from the areas pointed by the arrow in the
TEM image in Fig. 4(b). The appearance of diﬀraction as
perfect regular spots indicates the high crystallinity of the
large crystallites, which conﬁrms that the obtained ZnO
large crystallites are single crystals. Figure 4(f) shows the
SAD pattern of ﬁne crystallites taken from the TEM image
in Fig. 4(c). The pattern reveals that the ﬁne crystallites
tendency to form ZnO polycrystals. Furthermore, the
diﬀraction rings show separate dots, which indicates that
the growth of the ZnO polycrystallites attained some
preferred orientations.
As discussed earlier, the ZnO thin ﬁlms consist of two
typical particles: ﬁne ZnO polycrystallites joined together to
form the bottom layer and large ZnO single crystals on the
bottom layer. The epitaxial growth of ZnO crystals deposited
on the amorphous glass substrate suggests that, during
annealing, the ZnO source precursor near or in contact with
the surface of the glass in the dried ﬁlm tends to crystallize
and bind to the surface of glass when the solvent and organic
groups are removed, forming a ﬁne crystallite layer. Mean-
while, the excess source precursor being loosely attached or
not in contact with the glass surface will be transformed to
the large particles on the ﬁne crystallite layer. The ﬁne-
crystallite layer formed a new interface and aﬀected the
growth of the crystals that subsequently formed. The
interface nature altered the grain growth behavior of the
particles located directly on amorphous glass and the ZnO
polycrystallite layer.
The transmittance spectra of the ﬁlms prepared with
diﬀerent numbers of dip-coating times are shown in Fig. 5.
Figure 5(a) shows the 100% transmittance curve of the
glass substrate in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm.
Figure 5(b) shows no absorption bands in the ultraviolet and
visible ranges for the dried ﬁlms coated three times without
the annealing treatment. After the annealing treatment, the
ZnO ﬁlms start to show a shoulder absorption peak near
370 nm and a sharp absorption peak at approximately
290 nm in their transmittance spectra. The annealed ﬁlms
coated one or three times gave a high transmittance of up to
80% in the visible range, as shown in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d).
However, Figs. 5(e) and 5(f) show that ﬁlms coated more
than ﬁve times had a transmittance below 60%.
In Fig. 5, the highest attained transmittance in the visible
range decreases with increasing the number of dip-coating
times. As discussed earlier, the total thickness of the ZnO
ﬁlms increased with the number of dip-coating times, which
suggests that the thickness of the ﬁlms is one of the factors
that can be used to alter the transmittance of ZnO ﬁlms.
Furthermore, the transmission curve in Fig. 5(f) illustrates
an abnormal behavior, that is, no shoulder absorption peak
near 370 nm was observed. This eﬀect may be due to the
strong absorption of what in the visible range, leading to the
shoulder absorption peak near 370 nm being enveloped by
