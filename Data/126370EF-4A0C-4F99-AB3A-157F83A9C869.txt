隨著無線通訊產業的蓬勃發展，穩定傳輸、高傳輸率以及高移動性三項特性兼具之通
訊技術已成為用戶端對下世代無線傳輸技術之基本要求。因此，在本計畫的三年研究中我
們分別從兩大方面著手探討適用於快速移動環境之最佳化通訊系統設計，以達到提供高通
訊品質與高傳輸速率的目的。其一為結合通道估測與錯誤更正之時空碼編碼設計與其非同
調解碼設計，其二為新式的有限存取多終端系統分析與傳輸設計，該系統可免除傳統通訊
系統中高速移動載具漫遊於多個基地台所需的多次換手機制，進而提高傳輸速率與通訊品
質。經由三年的研究，對於結合通道估測與錯誤更正碼的部分我們提出一個系統化的演算
法能夠找出效能優異的非同調碼字；對於解碼部分我們也提供了一個循序解碼演算法能大
幅降低所需之解碼複雜度。對於新式的有限存取多終端系統之研究，我們已確立了此系統
在任意通道下之通道容量與相對應的最佳功率配置機制，而對於通道考量為“相加雜訊家
族”時，其最佳功率配置可由“二階段注水式配置準則”而得，此配置準則可視為消息理論
中註明的注水式功率配置之推廣與延伸。此外，藉由“二階段注水式配置準則”我們亦找出
任意通道雜訊程度之定義並探討了該定義在總功率趨近於零與趨近於無限大時的分析。

As the developments of wireless communication, stability in quality, high data rates and 
high mobility have become basic requirements in next generation communication technologies. 
In order to satisfy the three requirements simultaneously, we focus on two research topics in this 
three-years project. One is the design of combining channel estimation and error correcting 
space-time code, as well as its non-coherent decoder. The other highlights the analysis and 
design of a multiple-terminal system with limited access, which is a situation that may 
encounter in a highly mobile environment. In these three years, we have proposed a systematic 
algorithm to generate codewords instead of doing computer searching in the research of the first 
topic, and we also provided its maximum-likelihood-decoding algorithm with low complexity. 
For the analysis of the novel system with limited access, we have derived the channel capacity 
for general channel models and found the optimal power allocation to achieve the capacity. 
Moreover, when the channel model is reduced to additive noises of the same family, we found 
that the optimal power allocation can be obtained by a simple two-phase water-filling process. 
Finally, following the interpretation of two-phase water-filling, we can further characterize the 
degree of “noisiness” for general channels and analyze the degree of noisiness when total power 
is sufficiently small and large, respectively.

. In the above derivation, we assume that the receiver, although it knows 
nothing about , has perfect knowledge about the values (or the upper bounds) of P  and Q. 
2.1.2 Code construction: 
Based on years of research efforts, we already have some knowledge in the construction of 
non-coherent codes for P =0 (frequency nonselective) and P =1 (frequency selective). For 
completeness of this report, we list the code generating algorithm below. 
In the above coding design, the -th codeword must be of the form    
where  is a maximum-length shift-register sequence. When our code is compared with the 
three-times-repetitive (12, 6) code proposed by Xu et al, we found that when the channel 
coefficients remain constant over the entire coding block, the proposed (36, 6) code performs 0.7 
dB better than Xu's code as shown in Figure 1. More details can be found in [3].

2.1.4 Achievement: 
The channel parameters  in simulations is zero-mean complex-Gaussian distributed with 
. Note again that  is assumed an unknown constant vector at the 
system design stage; hence, the system designer does not know whether  is zero-mean 
complex-Gaussian distributed. Figure 2 then simulates three half-rate codes over frequency 
selective channels of memory order 1, in which the channel coefficients vary independently in 
every 15 symbols. The three codes are identified by (28, 14)(Q = 29), (28, 14)(Q = 15) and 
CS(14, 7), which respectively represent the constructed (28, 14) code with design parameter 
Q= 29 (i.e., assuming at the design stage, the channel coefficients remain constant at least 
during the entire decoding block L=N+P =28+1=29), the constructed (28, 14) code with 
design parameter Q = 15 (i.e., assuming the channel coefficients vary in every 15 symbols at 
the design stage), and the computer-searched (hence, structureless) (14, 7) code that minimizes 
the union bound derived based on the assumption that the channel taps remain constant during the 
decoding block (i.e., Q=L=N +P = 14+1 = 15, which is exactly the simulated channel).

2.2 Reviews of the work in the second year: 
As the number of mobile users as well as the requirement for data rate is rapidly increasing in 
modern communication systems, the base stations are gradually evolved from macro-cell-based 
to micro-cell-based. In particular, the service range of a macro-cell base station may be 
partitioned into several small ones, which are in turn served by several micro-cell base stations[4]. 
As such, in order to maintain the seamless data transmission, signals from multiple base stations 
are required to provide softer handover functionality. On the other hand, the demand for mobility 
is also increased recently, resulting in a more frequent softer handover. Thus, in order to provide 
high mobility and high data transmission rate simultaneously, we consider in this project a novel 
system, in which the data is encoded and distributed over N base stations such that the receiver 
can decode data successfully as long as a certain portion of signals (at least K) from N base 
stations are received. Since the channel model only requires at least K among N signals are 
received, it is named the (N,K)-limited access channel. In the second year of this project, we 
analyzed the channel capacity of (N,K)-limited access channel with arbitrary channel models and 
proposed an fast algorithm to evaluate the optimal power allocation which achieves the channel 
capacity. 
2.2.1 The system model: 
As shown in Figure 3, we consider a system that consists of N parallel channels, in which

overload the notation by denoting the channel output vector corresponding to one channel usage 
by Y = [Y1; Y2; : : : ; YN]
T , and likewisely denote by X = [X1;X2; : : : ;XN]
T  the channel input 
vector for a single channel usage. The achievable rate that guarantees a vanishing decoding error 
subject to

f 2f0;1gN : Ni=1 si¸Kg
I(
p
p ±X; s ± Y ) (2) 
Where <+ is the set of nonnegative real numbers. If the parallel channels are independent in the 
sense that 
 Pr(Y j
p
p ±X) =
NY
i=1
Pr(Yij

then the independence bound for mutual information gives that

NX
i=1
I(
p
piXi; siYi) =
NX
i=1
siI(
p
piXi;Yi) 
where the last equality follows from that si is either 1 or 0. We can therefore focus on the 
optimal power allocation for independent input distributions, if the channel transition probability 
satisfies (3). 
We next denote for convenience fi(p) , I(
p
piXi;Yi)  for 1· i·N , and make the 
following assumption on these mutual information functions. 
Assumption 1: For 1· i·N; fi(p) is continuous and strictly increasing for p ¸ 0, and its ﬁrst 
derivative, i.e., 
 f 0i(p) ,
@fi(p)
@p
 
exists and is continuous and strictly decreasing in p ¸ 0, where we deﬁne f 0i(0) , limp#0 f
0
i(p). 
This assumption will be adopted as a premise in the following analysis. Under Assumption 1, 
it is clear that fi(p) is a strictly concave function of p with initial value fi(0) = I(0; Yi) = 0. 
Together with the fact that fi(p) ¸ 0 for p 2 <+, we can replace the two inequality constraints 
in (2) by their equality counterparts as

However, the direct identification of A  without knowing p¤  in advance is in general a 
challenged. The opposite, i.e., identifying A after determining p
¤, is more straightforward. In 
order to resolve the optimization problem, we propose in the following subsections to ﬁrst 
determine the best power allocation p¦ corresponding to a conjectured 
maximal-mutual-information index set, denoted by B. Then, we will examine afterwards whether 
this conjecture is the optimal one or not based on some condition we will establish later. In case 
the conjectured B only achieves a suboptimal power allocation, a new round of maximization 
computation and follow-up examination will be launched based on a newly generated B. Since 
the established condition will help identifying one index that is not in A at each round, the 
process can hopefully stop after N ¡ jAj+ 1 iterations after which p¤ is obtained. 
A. Determination of the best power allocation p¦ corresponding to a given index set B 
Based on a given index set B, we transform the maximization-minimization problem into 
 sup
2P(B)
f
P
i=2B fi(pi) + (K ¡N + jBj)max1·j·N fj(pj)g (8) 
where P(B) is defined the same as (7) except that A is replaced with B. Since the given B 
may not be the optimal index set A, the solution p¦ of the optimization problem deﬁned in (8) 
could be at the boundary of P(B) in the sense that 
 fi(p
¦
i ) = max
1·j·N
fj(p
¦
j) for some i =2 B: 
For this reason, we use supremum instead of maximum in (8). 
We next show that this inequality constraint can be relaxed by means of the incorporation of 
the aggregate mutual information function that transforms the N-dimensional power allocation 
problem into an equivalent N ¡ jBj + 1-dimensional one. 
Definition 1: The aggregate mutual information function FB with respect to a sequence of 
mutual information functions ffigi2B is defined through its inverse function as 
 F
(inv)
B (y) ,
X
i2B
f
(inv)
i (y) for y ¸ 0 (9) 
provided that all the inverse functions exist (which is guaranteed by Assumption 1). 
 
 12 
By the reduction of constraints down to two in Q(B) in Lemma 2, we can further proceed to 
show that the inequality constraint in Q(B) is redundant in case q¦ 2 Q(B) as summarized in 
Theorem 1. 
Theorem 1: Given that q¦ 2 Q(B), the maximize q¦ for (11) is equal to the maximize ~q of the 
problem below:

where

P
i=2B qi+ qB =Pg 
We conclude this subsection by pointing out that the maximization computation in (12) is 
now performed over the usual single power-sum constraint, and hence can be solved by the 
Lagrange multipliers technique and KKT condition by treating (K ¡N + jBj)FB(qB) as the 
mutual information function of an auxiliary aggregate channel. Based on the result in Theorem 1, 
we are ready to present the algorithmic approach that helps identifying the optimal 
maximal-mutual-information index set A and the optimal power allocation p¤.

 candidate index sets for 
the choices of B in Theorem 1, and it may be time-consuming to perform the optimization

maximization labor can be reduced to only N ¡ jAj+ 1. 
Theorem 2: The optimal maximal-mutual-information index set A as well as the optimal power 
allocation p¤ can be obtained through the following algorithmic procedure: 
Step 1. Initialize M =1 and B1 = f1; 2; : : : ; Ng.

3.2 The system model: 
Although Gaussians are generally appropriate noise models for physical additive channels, 
experimental measurement indicates that the noises in certain environments are by no means 
Gaussian distributed [7][8][9]. As such, in the third year of this project, we consider additive 
noise of the same family in (N;K)-limited access channels. 
By additive noises of the same family, we mean that the relationship between channel inputs 
and outputs can be characterized by 
 Yi =
p
piXi +¾iZi for 1 · i ·N  (15) 
where fXig
N
i=1 and fZig
N
i=1 are both i.i.d. complex random variables with unit second moments, 
and they are independent from each other; the system model is shown as Figure 5. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5: System model for an (N;K)-limited access channel with additive noise of the same family, where 
E[jXij
2] =E[jZij
2] = 1, si 2 f0;1g for 1 · i · N , 
PN
i=1 si ¸ K  and 
PN
i=1 pi · P . 
We then restrict our attention only to the case that Zi is a continuous random variable 
because Assumption 1(at page 8) may fail when both Xi and Zi are discrete. Notably, Xi often 
takes values in a finite alphabet (e.g., f§1g) in practice. Specifically, when the intersection of 
two sets 
©p
pix+¾iz : PZi(z)> 0
ª
 and 
©p
pi~x+¾iz : PZi(z)> 0
ª
 is empty for every x 6= ~x 
with PXi(x) > 0 and PXi(~x) > 0, we have 
 fi(pi) = I(
p
piXi; Yi) = H(
p
piXi) = H(Xi) 
where H(Xi) is the entropy of the channel input Xi [10]. This implies that in a discrete system, 
fi(pi) can be equal to its maximum value H(Xi) almost everywhere in pi, in which case 
Assumption 1 is unquestionably violated. 
Observe that for continuous additive noises,

supporting the water that is going to be poured in with amount P . As a result, the volume of 
water ended up in each vessel is exactly the power that should be allocated. Notably, for the 
special case that the noises fZig
N
i=1 are complex Gaussian distributed, the heights of vessel bases 
can never be lowered in the pre-adjustment step; hence, a mercury-filling scheme before water 
pouring has been proposed to materialize the lifting of heights of vessel bases [11]. However, 
since the adjustment of heights of vessel bases generally can be in both up and down directions, 
the use of the name mercury/water filling may induce that the vessel bases should be lifted under 
general non-Gaussian additive noises; hence, we simply use the conventional name of 
water-filling in this work. 
Theorem 3: Suppose that the information transmitted over an (N;K)-limited access channel is 
corrupted by additive noises of the same family characterized by (15) and the mutual information 
function g(½) defined in (18) satisfies Assumption 1. Assume without loss of generality that

then ji = i in the high-power regime, provided that limp!1 f

i(p) = 0 for 1· i·N, 
where !i , limp!1fi(p). 
Since the input alphabet is usually finite for channels of practical interest, we have 
!i , limp!1fi(p)·H(Xi) <1:  This immediately validates the premise, i.e., 
limp!1 f
0
i(p) = 0 ,  for condition (28) implying ji = i in the high-power regime. In other 
words, limp!1 f

i(p) = 0 is true for all finite-input channels. There however exists a certain 
kind of channels where !i =1 while limp!1 f

i(p) = 0. An example is the Gaussian-input  
AWGN channel for which fi(p) = log (1 + p=¾

i ). We would like to emphasize that the inference 
regarding (28) still remains valid for channels with unbounded mutual information as long as

Conditions (27) and (28) in Lemma 3 involve the examination of the limit supremum of 
function differences. The following corollary shows that their validity can be guaranteed by 
comparing the limiting behaviors of individual functions. 
Corollary 1: 
1. The validity of (27) for an (i; j) pair is certain if one of the three conditions below is 
satisfied: 
 
8
><
>:
f 0i(0) < f
0
j(0)
f 0i(0) = f
0
j(0) and f
(
i 0) < f
(
j0)
(9 ± > 0) f 0i(p) · f
0
j(p) for 0 < p < ±
 (29) 
2. The validity of (28) for an (i; j) pair is certain if 
 !i = lim
p!1
fi(p) < !j = lim
p!1
fj(p): (30) 
According to the above discussions, we can identify the degree of noisiness for general 
channel easily by the sufficient conditions provided in Theorem 4, Lemma 3 and Corollary 1.

    此次 ISIT2012 研討會在蘇俄聖彼得堡舉行，我與我的學生共有兩篇論文為
研討會所接受，有一篇被拒絕，但我認為那篇論文也是極好之成果，因此轉投
ISIT2012 的 Recent Result Section，因此此次共有三名學生同行。 
 
    研討會一如往常有非常多著名的研究者參加，我們的論文發表後，有幾位研
究者如 Buttigieg 表示興趣，並有諸多交流。會中，我亦曾與著名消息理論研究
者匈牙利國家工程院士 Csiszar 共餐，請教其對我們論文之後續建議。相信這樣
的交流，使我們的成果為更多研究者所瞭解，也因此我們得知我們投稿至 IEEE 
Trans. On Information Theory 期刊論文也將為期刊所接受。 
 
    在 Recent Result Section，我碩士生張紊傑表現相當穩健，對於各研究專
家當場詢問皆能有條有理回覆，相信這樣的訓練對於學生是非常難得的。 
 
    這次出國，本人用國科會出國經費，學生則經由 5年五百億補助，並另外申
請大會與 IEEE 部份補助，乃至於本系亦有部份經費補助，始得成行。希望未來
有機會，亦能帶學生出國參加如 ISIT 之國際大型研討會，拓展學生視野。
