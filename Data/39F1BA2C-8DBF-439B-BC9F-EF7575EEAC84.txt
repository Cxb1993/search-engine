understood. However, an increasing interest in the hyperfine details of these structures, such as their 
spin-splitting characteristics for instance, has led to the emergence of a new research field known as 
spintronics. 
(二) 研 究 目 的 
The purpose of the current study is to analyze the 3k  term in order to formulate its analytical 
mathematical forms for zincblende bulk and quantum wells (QWs) orientated along different growth 
directions, respectively. 
 (三) 文 獻 探 討 
The electron states in a crystal are known to be doubly degenerate if the system has both time reversal and 
space inversion symmetries. However, the spin degeneracy property is lost under the application of an 
external magnetic field since the time reversal symmetry is destroyed.1 Furthermore, a lack of inversion 
symmetry, due to the crystalline structure itself or caused by the application of an external force field (e.g. 
strain, electric field, structural confinement, and so forth), may also result in a loss of spin degeneracy.2,3 
The loss of spin degeneracy in semiconductor heterostructures in the zero-field condition has attracted 
considerable attention in the spintronics field. It is believed that zero-field spin splitting may be induced 
by one of two different mechanisms, namely (i) a 3k  term in the conduction and valence band 
expressions related to microscopic inversion asymmetry (generally referred to as the Dresselhaus effect), 
or (ii) an interfacial spin-orbit interaction term (referred to as the Rashba effect).4-10 
(四) 研 究 方 法 
The 22×  conduction band, 44×  hole band and 22×  spin-orbit split-off band matrices of 
zincblende semiconductors are obtained using a block diagonal technique. Importantly, the block diagonal 
matrices incorporate not only the interband coupling effect, but also the bulk inversion asymmetry effect. 
Analytical expressions for the conduction band spin-splitting energies of GaAs zincblende bulk and 
quantum wells grown on [001]-, [111]- and [110]-oriented substrates are formulated by solving the block 
diagonal matrices. The results show that odd-in-k terms exist in both the bulk and the quantum well 
expressions due to the bulk inversion asymmetry effect. The presence of these terms is shown to induce 
 4
band, and 22×  spin-orbit split-off band matrices. Importantly, the block diagonal matrices incorporate 
not only the interband coupling effect, but also the bulk inversion asymmetry effect. The calculation 
results have shown that the bulk inversion asymmetry in the block diagonal matrix representation is 
consistent with the results from the viewpoint of symmetry. By solving the block diagonal matrices, 
analytical expressions have been obtained for the conduction band spin-splitting energies of both 
zincblende bulk and quantum wells grown on [001]-, [111]- and [110]-oriented substrates.
