plume and the reflective target. The extinction profile of the plume was then solved by inverting 
the lidar equation with the transmittance and backscattering measurements. 
METHODS 
The experiments were conducted at Cape Fuguei Atmospheric Observatory (25.30°N, 121.54°E) 
locating at north tip of Taiwan. Cape Fuguei Observatory is an aerosol observation site 
constructed by the Research Center for Environmental Changes (RCEC), Academia Sinica to 
investigate the long range transport of pollutants from China to Taiwan. The direct distance 
between observatory and coast is about 50 meters. A schematic drawing of the experiment 
configuration is shown in Fig. 1. The plumes of PM from kerosene flame or rice straw burning 
are generated in a chamber located at downwind area 60 meters away from the lidar. The 
elevation angle of laser beam is about 20° and a building behind the smoke plumes at 160 m is 
served as a reflective target. 
 
Figure 1:  Scheme of the experiment configuration. 
Our lidar is a depolarization lidar system employing the second harmonics of Nd:YAG laser at 
532 nm. Detailed specification of this lidar is given in Table 1.

shape. Depolarization is close to zero for spherical particle. For Asian Dust and sea salt, the 
depolarization ratios are about 5-30%3,4,5 and 8-22%6, respectively. 
Solving the lidar equation requires knowing how extinction-to-backscatter ratio (or so called lidar 
ratio) S=σ/β varies along the light path7. Lidar ratio can be retrieved by measuring the aerosol 
extinction profile8 or integrated aerosol optical thickness9. In this study, aerosol transmission TH 
determined by a reflective hard target method is applied for lidar signal inversion. 
Two algorithms developed by researchers at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
(UIUC)10 and Klett7, respectively, were applied to retrieve the aerosol extinction profiles. Lidar 
ratio S could be determined by adjusting S until calculated aerosol transmission Tc approach TH.  
The research team at UIUC developed a hard target based inversion algorithm. Light 
transmissions through the dust plumes were determined from the reflective target’s signals before 
(NRBt0) and after (NRBb) the plume passing through the laser optical depth:

where NRB is the normalized relative backscatter  The extinction 
profile is then determined by solving a system of equations (N+1):

As for the Klett’s algorithm, it had been wildly applied for lidar inversion7. The extinction profile 
was calculated by a downward or backward integration equation with a pre-defined initial 
condition (β1 or σ1) at far end.

Figure 2:  Extinction profiles of burning kerosene and rice straw derived by UIUC and Klett 
algorithm. 
For the rice straw burning, there is no clear correlation between the depolarization ratio and 
extinction ratio. Several observations12,13 had indicated that fresh biomass smokes are composed 
of fine mode particles; therefore, depolarization ratio of rice straw burning in general is expected 
to be as low as 1.5 to 3%14. In this study, the minimum depolarization ratio of PM from the rice 
straw burning is about 4.5%, which is lower than background sea-salt aerosols. This suggests that 
the PM from rice straw burning in general are predominated by fine mode or spherical particles. 
It is worth pointing out that there is an unexpected peak depolarization ratio about 7%, right 
behind the peak value of extinction. It is probably caused by soil materials or plant ashes uplifted 
by thermal convection15, or the non-spherical particles due to coagulation of smoke particles16. 
Similar high depolarization ratio had also been observed in Siberian forest fire smoke17.

extinction was contributed by absorption and the lidar ratio might be 2 or 3 times larger than 
particles of similar size distribution. 
The lidar ratio derived from Klett algorithm is a physical quantity that could not be directly got 
by UIUC algorithm. Nevertheless, C* from the UIUC algorithm should be a quantity inversely 
proportional to the lidar ratio (Eq. 6). The scatter diagram of the lidar ratio and C* is shown in 
Fig. 3(b). C* is clearly inversely correlated with lidar ratio with R2≈0.9. This result shows that 
SUMMARY 
C* 
might be applied to determine the lidar ratio after appropriate calibration. 
The extinction profile and optical properties of PM from the kerosene flame and rice straw 
burning derived by UIUC and Klett algorithms are presented in this study. The lidar ratio of PM 
from kerosene flames are significant larger than ones of PM from rice straw burning. Unexpected 
high depolarization ratio (~7%) was found in plume of rice straw burning, which is probably 
caused by soil particles or coagulated smokes. Both the UIUC and Klett algorithm were 
successfully applied to derive the spatial distribution of the burning smokes. However, detailed 
field aerosol sampling and further chemical analyses are needed to interpret our observation. 
SELF EVALUATION 
In this study, we set up a chamber in the field and successfully applied the LIDAR to measure 
aerosols from kerosene and rice straw burning. This measurement system could be modified to 
further detect the aerosol distribution occurred at various large-scale burning activities. We have 
achieved the original aim of using optical remote sensing techniques to characterize air pollutants 
from emissions sources.

一、參加會議經過 
The 100th Annual Air and Waste Management Association (A&WMA) Conference & 
Exhibition was held in Pittsburgh, PA, USA this year. The A&WMA was established to 
improve environmental knowledge and decisions by providing a neutral forum for exchanging 
information. During the annual meeting each year, researchers and experts in the field of 
environmental health and environmental engineers present their latest research results.  
The theme of the conference in this year is Energizing Environmental Solutions. Several 
presentation formats were organized, including symposiums, plenary sessions, and poster

Military Activities”. The research group from the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign presented their study results of using a Micro-Pulse Lidar for aerosol 
monitoring. They developed a novel algorithm to retrieve the extinction coefficient 
information from the Lidar signal. This is a significant improvement since traditional Lidar 
equation only calculated the backscattering signals and thus can not relate them to the mass 
concentrations directly.  
3. Paper# 824: “Near Road Nitric Oxide and Hydrocarbon Measurements with DUV DOAS”. 
A US EPA group presented an interesting approach of using deep UV DOAS for motor 
vehicle emission monitoring. In this study, they found that the nitric oxide is a good tracer 
for nitrogen dioxide and can be easily monitored in real-time by the DUV DOAS. They 
further demonstrated that the traffic and wind direction were the two main determinants of 
nitric oxide. Since the air quality in Taipei is heavily influenced by the motor vehicle 
emissions, adopting this methodology for local use will be beneficial. One could further 
extend its application for other air pollutants such as benzene, toluene, etc.    
4. Paper #156: “Odor CEM on a WWTP Biosolid Composting Facility”. The technology of 
‘electronic noise’ has been developed and discussed in the past few years. In this 
presentation, a company demonstrated their full system of combining the e-noise, weather 
data, and internet communication for detailed source identification. Ideally this system 
could be modified and improved with optical remote sensing sensors. Odors complain is a 
16 
 
target was employed in the field. They also kindly went through their computers codes and 
programs in details with me so I can expect how much computing efforts were involved in 
their data analyses. 
During the discussion session, I briefly explained our proposal of using Lidar (that is 
developed by the Sinica) for biomass burning monitoring. Our plan is to conduct a controlled 
experiment first and then a real field campaign. Professor Rood gave many valuable 
suggestions and agreed providing additional scientific consultation when we need. I believe 
this is a successful visit and will be a first step for future collaboration.     
四、建議 
There are many researchers from Taiwan attending this conference regularly each year. 
Nevertheless, not much effort has been put together to increase our influence on this 
association. Some type of pre-conference arrangement should be considered for the meeting 
next year so we can have better coordination among the Taiwanese researchers and achieve a 
common goal. In addition, the A&WMA offer several awards. Some of them are specific for 
students (e.g. scholarship, poster competition, and student chapters). We should encourage 
students to participate such activities.

2. Paper #768: “Portable Open-Path Ozone and Ammonia Sensor using Quantum Cascade 
Lasers”. In this presentation, the authors showed the development process and test results 
of a new optical remote sensing instrument. This instrument use advanced quantum 
cascade lasers as light sources and is capable of detecting ozone and ammonia in urban 
areas with high sensitivity. These researchers are from MIRTHE, a US National Science 
Foundation Engineering Research Center headquartered at Princeton University. Through 
the discussion with the presenter, I notice that there are many potential collaboration 
opportunities with that center. They are also interested in identifying applications in the 
field of environmental health for their measurement techniques.  
3. Paper #587: “Measurement of Total Site Mercury Emissions from a Chlor-Alkali Plant 
Using Open-Path UV-DOAS” The mercury emission flux was estimated with the 
UV-DOAS using the vertical radial plume mapping approach in this study. Their test 
results showed that the measurement uncertainties were estimated to be within 20%. 
Through the discussion with the authors, I learned that if the locations of the emission 
sources are known, it is not required to have a one-dimensional horizontal scanning 
geometry near the ground level. This can significantly reduce the data collection efforts.

The theme of the conference in this year is Integrating Science and Sustainability. Several
presentation formats were organized, including symposiums, plenary sessions, and poster
sessions. The main presentation topics cover a wide range of research interests, such as optical
remote sensing techniques, greenhouse gas emissions, air quality models, particulate matters
studies …etc.
二、與會心得
The topic of my presentation is “A feasibility study of applying lidar to determine
extinction profiles of agriculture burning related aerosols”. I received several useful comments
regarding our research methodologies and results. I also arranged a meeting during the
conference to discuss the experimental details with our collaborators from the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We also discussed the contents that should be covered in the
geometry near the ground level. This can significantly reduce the data collection efforts.
4. Paper #507: “Assessing Extremely Near-Field Dispersion –Analytical, Computational
Fluid Dynamics or Wind-Tunnel Modeling”. In this presentation, the authors discussed the
pros and cons of three different methods for evaluating the extremely near-field dispersion
scenarios. After the presentation, I had the chance to ask the authors regarding a question
that was critical to my research. They provided me some very useful references and one of
them is the Workbook of Atmospheric Dispersion Estimates by D. Bruce Turner. With a
simple estimation of the“roughness”parameter, our group should be able to model the air
dispersion conditions in our controlled field experiments in the future.
5. Paper #297: “New Receptor Modeling Methods for Routine and 1-Minute Air Quality
Monitoring Data”. Conventional source apportionment models require extensive chemical
speciation data to identify sources of air pollutants. In this study, the authors demonstrated
a novel approach of using regular air quality monitoring data with back trajectory models
to identify emission sources in an urban environment. The Taiwan EPA collects air quality
data routinely throughout Taiwan. This proposed approach could significantly improve the
usefulness of these data.

The backscattering signal for a single wavelength Rayleigh lidar is described by the lidar equation
as follows:

where P
L
is the power of laser; P(z) is the scattering signal received from altitude z; A is the
system calibration factor (includes area of telescope and efficiencies of detector);m anda are the
volume backscattering coefficient of air molecular and aerosol, respectively; T(z) is the atmospheric
transmission between lidar and range z defined as follows:

whereis the volume extinction coefficient.
Depolarization ratio DP is defined as the ratio of the return light of perpendicular to parallel
polarization:
(3)
where and are the integrated return power for parallel and perpendicular directions relative
to the outgoing laser beam. The depolarization ratio can be considered as an indicator of the
non-sphericity of particle and had been widely applied to study irregularly shaped particle such as
cirrus cloud1,2. Lidar measurements had revealed that particles such as Asian dust, biomass burning,
detection system are all removed from the following analysis. The maximum average extinction for
the PM from kerosene flames and rice straw burning are about 210-3 1/m and 610-3 1/m,
respectively. Compared to the values from the UIUC algorithm, the integrated optical thicknesses
are the same but the extinction values derived by the Klett method are higher at the primary plumes
and lower at the far end. These differences are probably caused by the low initial value used in the
Klett method, indicating that the retrieved extinction profile from the latter method was
significantly affected by the initial condition.
The depolarization ratio had been widely applied as an indicator of existence of coarse irregularly
shaped particles11. As shown in Fig. 2, the depolarization ratio of the background aerosols is about
5.2% which was caused by the crystallized sea-salt aerosols6. Inside the primary plume of kerosene
flame, the maximum depolarization ratio is about 6% and depolarization ratio is positively
correlated with extinction coefficient, implying that particles generated from kerosene flame might
be non-spherical particles in the coarse mode.

pointing out that there is an unexpected peak depolarization ratio about 7%, right behind the peak
value of extinction. It is probably caused by soil materials or plant ashes uplifted by thermal
convection15, or the non-spherical particles due to coagulation of smoke particles16. Similar high
depolarization ratio had also been observed in Siberian forest fire smoke17.
kerosene flames are significant larger than ones of PM from rice straw burning. Unexpected high
depolarization ratio (~7%) was found in plume of rice straw burning, which is probably caused by
soil particles or coagulated smokes. Both the UIUC and Klett algorithm were successfully applied
to derive the spatial distribution of the burning smokes. However, detailed field aerosol sampling
and further chemical analyses are needed to interpret our observation.
