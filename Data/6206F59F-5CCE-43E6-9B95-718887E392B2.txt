1.2 Simulation
The simulation is a continuous task. Currently, the layers of the device have been specified according to the
simulation, as shown in Fig. 1. The reflectance spectrum is obtained by simulation, as shown in Fig. 2. For

comparison, the reflectance spectrum of the conventional dielectric stack mirror (the first-order, QWS for
λ0 = 520 nm) is also plotted as the dashed curve in Fig. 2.
The calculated intensity spectrum of the device, based on the intensity spectrum measurement data of
the bare white OLED is shown in Fig. 3.
The chromaticity of the emitted light is shown in Fig. 4. They are computed with the emitted light
intensity spectra shown in Fig. 3. The “noncavity” denotes the case of the bare white OLED, where the
intensity spectrum is measured. On the other hand, the “microcavity” denotes the case of the white OLED
with the microcavity, where the intensity spectrum is simulated.
The layers’ specification may need further simulation and modification, if device making yields un-
desired result and the critical parameters for simulation are identified.
1.3 Organic material for white OLED
Our research partners at Academia Sinica help to formulate the white OLED organic layers as shown in
Fig. 5. Its light intensity spectrum is measured and shown in the dashed curve in Fig. 3. Its chromaticity is
shown in Fig. 4.
1.4 Discussion
We have demonstrated by simulation that a white-light OLED with a microcavity structure can be enhanced
in its chromaticity. In particular, we can move the CIE x, y of the original spectrum to a new location,
i.e., a different color. The microcavity of higher order device has a pure white-light emission with the CIE
chromaticity coordinate of (0.3270, 0.3383) compared with the noncavity device of (0.3299, 0.3810). This
will surely lead to high performance devices.

However, the microcavity structure restricts the device with the small viewing angle [9]. Our present
study assumes the normal direct viewing angle for simplicity. The study of other viewing angles will be
included in future study.
On the other hand, the success of our microcavity design depends on the well-controlled reflectance
phase spectrum φd(λ) of the dielectric mirror as well as the total optical length spectrum Lt(λ) of the mi-
crocavity. However, there are a few factors which affects the accuracy of φd(λ) and Lt(λ) in our simulation:
for example, the knowledge of each layer’s thickness, index of refraction, and absorption coefficient (alter-
natively, the real and the imaginary parts of the complex index of refraction). In particular, the absorption
effect of the layers was not considered in our previous study. Although the dielectric layers in the mirror are
designed to be made of nearly lossless materials (SiO2 and Ta2O5), some absorption / loss may be attributed
to the organic layers. Unfortunately, there are few references regarding to the absorption coefficient of the
organic materials used in OLED devices. Therefore, this has been identified as the critical factor for us to
successfully make the microcavity for OLED devices.
Because of these considerations, the device design needs refinement and the device fabrication has been
postponed into the successor of the project, the project NSC 97-2221-E-155-004-.
