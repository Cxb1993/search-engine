(三) 前言 
The important way to curb cancer is to kill the fast proliferating malignant tissues. 
Traditional cancer therapies such as surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy lack selectivity 
in removing or destroying diseased tissue and sparing normal healthy cells. The higher degree of 
selectivity offered by this modality and fewer side effects when compared to chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy has prompted the researchers around  the globe to generate new photosensitizers. 
Thus the development of new treatment protocols like PDT is very important.【1】 
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective single modality treatment for both deep-seated 
and superficial tumors. Three fundamental requirements for PDT are oxygen, light source and 
photosensitizer. Each factor is harmless by itself, but their combination can produce cytotoxic 
agents that kill tumor cells. In PDT, the photosensitizer preferentially localizes in rapidly growing 
cells and gets activated by the exposure of light in presence of oxygen to generate very reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and this combination of dual sensitivity makes PDT one of the most 
progressively targeted domain. PDT depends on the uptake of the photosensitizing compound 
(photosensitizers) by cancerous tissues, followed by selective irradiation with specific light with 
an appropriate wavelength that is absorbed by the photosensitizer.【2-5】 
In general, PDT induces cell death through production of reactive oxidative species such as 
singlet oxygen (.O2) as well as other ROS 【6】. Due to its short lifetime, singlet oxygen 
intracellular diffusion distance is not more than 0.01–0.02 µm, and therefore its direct action is 
limited to the intracellular structure where the sensitizer localizes.【7-8】Moreover, it is now 
recognized that damage to certain subcellular structures is correlated to a specific cell death 
mechanism. 
 
(四) 研究目的 
We prepared a series of meso-substituted porphyrins, such as  4-aminophenyl and 
4-pyridine, with a varied degree of hydrophobic/ hydrophilic substitution as model compounds 
for localization studies of photosensitizers and photodynamic activity in the tumor cells.  
 
(五) 文獻探討 
Mitochondrial localized photosensitizers are able to induce apoptosis very rapidly【9】and 
cytochrome C release is one of the best known apoptotic events after photosensitization.【10-11】
Mitochondrial dysfunction leads not only to the interruption of the energy supply, but also to the 
activation of the mitochondria mediated apoptotic pathway.【12】 
It is important, therefore, to investigate treatment strategies aimed at novel cellular targets 
with sufficiently discrimination between normal cells and cancer cells so as to provide a basis for 
selective tumor cell killing. So far the relationship between the meso-substitutents of porphyrin 
and their selective accumulation and phototoxicity in tumor cells remains an issue. Subcellular 
localization of photosensitizers played a major role in photodynamic efficacy. The cellular

Singlet Oxygen Detection 
The Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green reagent were purchased from Invitrogen, USA. And it is 
highly selective for 1O2 ; unlike other available fluorescent and chemiluminescent singlet oxygen 
detection reagents, it does not show any appreciable response to hydroxyl radical (.OH) or 
superoxide (.O2-). This new singlet oxygen indicator initially exhibits weak blue fluorescence, 
with excitation peaks at 372 and 393 nm and emission peaks at 395 and 416 nm.In the presence 
of singlet oxygen , it emits a green fluorescence similar to that of fluorescein (excitation/emission 
488/524 nm). And then the fluorescence intensity was measured with fluorescence micro-plate 
reader Gemini EM (Molecular devices, Germany). 
 
Cell culture and incubation conditions 
Human cervical epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa) cells were maintained in a humidified 5% 
CO2 incubator at 37°C in DMEM (Gibco BRL, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-activated 
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics (Antibiotic-Antimycotic, Gibco BRL, USA). 
When cells were in exponential growth, the medium was removed and washed twice with PBS , 
and then cells were replaced with fresh medium. To subculture Hela cells 2~3 times every week. 
The T75 (or T25) flasks, 60mm (or 35mm) dishes , and 96-wells plates in this study were 
purchased from Nunc (Nunc,Denmark). 
 
Intracellular uptake 
Hela cells were seeded on 96-well culture plates about 3000 cells per wells within a 100 
µL culture medium .  After growing  overnight , 
cells were exposed to various  concentration  (0.5~50µM) of different 
porphyrins in medium to study dose-dependent drug accumulation. After 
incubation for 24 hr , the cells were washed twice with PBS ,and then the fluorescence intensity 
of cellular uptake was measured with fluorescence microplate reader Gemini EM (Molecular 
devices, Germany). 
Cytotoxicity and PDT effect study 
To assess the cytotoxicity of the porphyrins, Hela cells were seeded on a 96-wells culture 
plate about 3000 cells per well in 100µL culture medium  (DMEM) .In dark cytotoxicity 
experiments ,  porphyrins were added  to wells from 0.5µM to 50µM and then incubated for 
24h. Photo- toxicity experiments were proformed on Hela cells in 96-well plates as above. After  
24 hr incubation , the compounds were removed, the cells were washed with PBS and then 
exposed to light by LumiSource® (peak  wavelength 435 nm, 7mW/cm2 ) for 40s. The total 
light dose was 0.28 J/ cm2.For light-dose dependent photodynamic effect,cells were incubated 
with the same concentration for 24hr ,and then exposed to light for 10, 20

with different meso-substitutents 
exhibited a relatively high hydrophobicity.

Green reagent to 1O2. Fluorescence measurements were made in a fluorescence micro-plate 
reader using excitation/emission of 488/524 nm for solutions containing: 1µM Singlet Oxygen 
Sensor Green reagent and about 250µM of all porphyrins in 100 mM pH 7.5 Tris buffer. During 
the 30-second intervals, the samples were exposed to light by LumiSource®(peak wavelength 
435 nm, 7mW/cm2 ) from 0s to 30min.
