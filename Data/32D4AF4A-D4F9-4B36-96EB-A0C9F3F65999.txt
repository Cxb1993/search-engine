 
I. INTRODUCTION
A key issue in video coders with motion-compensated prediction is how to trade off effectively between
the accuracy of the motion field representation and the required overhead. Often a rough representation
of the motion field is sufficient to provide good temporal prediction in terms of rate-distortion (R-D)
performance. Obvious evidences are the frequent occurrence of large motion partitions and of SKIP mode.
Accordingly, many literatures related to the decoder-side motion vector derivation (DMVD) techniques
are proposed, hoping to leverage the ever-increasing processing capability of the decoder to save motion
overhead.
Template matching prediction (TMP) [4] is a well-known DMVD technique. It estimates the motion
vector (MV) of a target block by minimizing the matching error over the reconstructed pixels in the
template region, which is inverse-L-shaped and sitting on the top and to the left of the target block.
Based on the concept, many of its variants have been proposed. Coding the target block at a lower spatial
resolution followed by an interpolation was found more R-D efficient in flat areas, where TMP does
not always guarantee to find a physically meaningful MV [10]. Even in non-flat areas, the template MV
is merely a rough estimate of the target block’s motion. Hence, the multi-hypothesis prediction becomes
popular to improve TMP [8]. Other alternatives include higher weight to pixels spatially closer to the target
block when calculating the template matching error [3], and adapting the template shape and location to
local signal characteristics [6].
Another school of thought follows multi-hypothesis TMP, but one of the hypotheses is sent as a coded
MV. Apparently, how to optimize this MV is the key to its effectiveness. It is obtained by carrying out
block matching as for BMC and then used as an initial estimate to confine template matching search [9].
However, this scheme is not guaranteed a minimal prediction residual, for it neglects the combined effect
of involved predictors. To overcome this problem, our prior works [5] proceed in reverse order, resulting
in less residual than TMP and BMC. Because the scheme is achieved with two hypotheses, it is viewed
as a particular bi-prediction featuring only one coded MV.
The critical step of the above bi-prediction is the combination of predictors. A simple way is to compute
their average [12]. In this report, we approach the problem from a theoretical perspective, assuming the
use of the more general weighting scheme of overlapped block motion compensation (OBMC) [7]. Based
on the underpinnings of [11] and [14], we show that the template MV is close to the true motion of a pixel
near the top-left corner of the target block. A similar argument is then utilized to convert the problem of
1
Similarly, in [14], Zheng et al. introduced a motion model assuming that the difference between the
true MVs of any two pixels obeys the normal distribution:
(s1)− (s2) or (s1)− (s2) ∼ N (0 b2(s1 s2)) (2)
where  is a constant indicating the degree of motion variation in the horizontal or vertical direction, and
(s1 s2) = ||s1− s2||2 is the 2 distance between pixels s1 and s2. The "hat" in (2) indicates that its value
will be clipped when exceeding a maximum threshold, which is essential for the model to be proper [2].
Equation (2) leads to the following autocorrelation function:
[(s1)(s2)] = [(s1)(s2)] = 2 − 2 b2(s1 s2) (3)
assuming the motion field is (wide-sense) stationary and zero-mean.
With these models, a closed-form expression for the mean-sqaure prediction error, [2(s;v(q))] where
(s;v(q)) ≡ (s)−−1(s + v(q)), of pixel s based on the true MV of pixel q can be obtained. This
result is useful for analyzing various prediction schemes, as we shall see later. In [11], the derivation is
done by a direct application of (1a) and (1b) in evaluating [(−1(s+ v(s))−−1(s+ v(q)))2], where,
under the constant intensity assumption, −1(s+ v(s)) has been substituted for (s). This gives
[2(s;v(q))] = 8
22

Zheng et al. [14] take a different approach to find [2(s;v(q))], without the need of an intensity
model. They approximate the prediction error by Taylor expansion, (s;v(q)) ≈  0()−1(s+ v(q))((s)−
(q))+ 0()−1(s+ v(q)) ((s)− (q)), take expectation of the square of both sides, and assume the  
components of  0−1(s+ v(q)) and (v(s)− v(q)) are all independent of each other, to get
[2(s;v(q))] ∼= b2(sq) ∼= ||s− q||22 (5)
where (2) is put into use and  = [( 0()−1(s+ v(q)))2 + ( 0()−1(s+ v(q)))2].
According to (4) and (5), several parallels between them can be drawn:
• The minimum of [2(s;v(q))] is reached when pixel q coincides with pixel s, which is obvious
from the constant intensity assumption.
• The value of [2(s;v(q))] increases when pixel q is further away from pixel s and converges to a
value proportional to 822 or , both have to do with the joint randomness of the motion and
intensity fields.
• The shape of [2(s;v(q))], when viewed as a surface in the three-dimensional space constituted by

error surfaces predicted by Tao and Zheng’s models, respectively. (BasketballDrill,  =  = 16,  = 4)
to compute the error variance for every pixel s in B. The results are visualized in Fig. 1 and compared
with empirical surfaces that have been generated through real encoding.
The error surfaces of BMC, predicted respectively by the models, are convex shapes, whose minimum
occur at the block center; in other words, the error variance tends to be smaller around the center and larger
at block boundaries, which is understandable if we recall that v approximates v(s). Following the same
argument, the residual of TMP has a larger variance at the bottom-right quarter of the target block, because
v, when viewed as v(s), generally has a weaker correlation to pixels’ true motion there. Comparing
these results with their empirical counterparts confirms the accuracy of our theoretical predictions.
III. BI-PREDICTION COMBINING TMP AND BMC
A. Problem Formulation
The fact that in this application, v cannot be specified discretionarily by the encoder poses the key
question of what is then the most appropriate choice for v and the OBMC weights which, along with the
given v, would minimize the residual for every block. Obviously, we cannot afford to specify a unique
set of OBMC weights for each block, so the same weights must be shared among different blocks. Such
restriction leads us to the following problem formulation:
minimize

Obviously, for (10) to be minimized, the optimal  (es) must satisfy, for all s ∈ B,
 (es) = [(s;v(s))((s;v(s))− (s;v(s)))][((s;v(s))− (s;v(s))2]  (11)
where (s;v(q))=(s)−−1(s + v(q)) q = s or s. Recall that from Table I, s is known once the
template shape and signal model are selected. Then, substituting (11) into (10), the summation is seen to
be a function of  [(s;v(s))2],  [(s;v(s))2] and  [(s;v(s))(s;v(s))], and s is the last term to
be solved. Depending on which signal model is in use, the optimal s can be derived as

with Zheng’s model. In particular, both equations suggest that there is no closed-form expression for
s∗–i.e., it has to be sought numerically.
Fig. 3 plots the sum of prediction error variances over the target block B as a function of s’s position,
with (0 0) being the position of the top-left pixel in B. The sum reaches the minimum when s∗ sits in the
bottom-right quarter (see Table II for s∗). As was noted before, TMP is less efficient in predicting pixels
in the bottom-right area. It is natural to expect the block MV to be so sampled as to compensate for its
inefficiency. Once s∗ is known, the corresponding (es) is immediately obvious by (11) (See Fig. 4).

Note – The results shown are with Tao’s model and 2 hypotheses.
B. Adaptive Template Switching
The coding performance of the TB-mode can improve at the cost of extra signaling overhead and
computation. For instance, the encoder can switch between different template designs (see Fig. 5) to
better adapt to time-varying signal characteristics. Of course, besides signaling the choice of template, the
OBMC weights and block MV also need to be optimized by the same procedure described in Section III.
From Table IV, this scheme further improves the rate saving by 0.4-0.6%, adding up to an average BD-rate
saving of 1.2%, while elevating the encoding and decoding time ratios to 114% and 119%, respectively,
due to extra computation needed for mode decision.
C. Multi-hypothesis Extension
The results given above have been generated by limiting the hypothesis number to two. Considering
a three-hypothesis case, two block MVs, v1 and v2, and their associated OBMC weights, 1 (es) and
2 (es), has to be determined. More unknowns are to be solved, which largely complicates the iteration
process of the LS solution, so we resort to the LMS approach. In analogy with (10), the objective is to
find two pixels, s1 and s2, in the target block B that minimize:

where v, v1 and v2 are modeled, respectively, by v(s) v(s1) and v(s2) with s as a priori, and
 (es) = 1−1 (es)−2 (es). Proceeding in much the same way as in [2], we can solve for the solution,
s∗1 and s∗2, by evaluating  for all permissible values of s1 s2 ∈ B, which involves only the second-order
moments of (s;v(s)) (s;v(s1)) (s;v(s2)).4 Using the result, v1 and v2 are then estimated by

reason, its decoding time increase is as considerable as (2 v’s + 2 v’s).
D. Generalization to Motion Merging
The idea of Motion Merging [13] is to send few bits to reuse MV(s) from a previously decoded
neighboring PU as v. It is similar to treating the motion sample taken at the center of the referred
PU as v, in which case selecting adaptively from a range of candidate PUs is assimilated to switching
between different template designs. In this analogy, we simply apply the previous OBMC windows to
the present case, and the weight values are rounded to power-of-two numbers with 3-bit integer precision
for simplification. Comparing Table VI with Table V, the performance declines 0.5-1.0% across different
experiments, but also much lower encoding and decoding time increases. The high complexity associated
with TMP can be thus resolved. Performance loss may be inevitable; it however can be mitigated without
significantly complicating the decoder.
V. CONCLUSION
We proposed a bi-prediction scheme combining BMC and TMP predictors through OBMC. First, TMP
is examined in the context of motion field sampling and showed that the template MV may be viewed
as the pixel true motion around the template centroid. Following a similar argument, we formulated the
problem of finding an MV to best complement the template MV as the search of its sampling location in
the motion field. This formulation allows solving the problem analytically and leading to useful insights
into the solution. We found that when sampled optimally, this MV, along with the template MV, forms
