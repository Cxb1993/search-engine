good enough to be used as an additional heating layer in PRAMs. The developments of new 
heating layer and optimum operation modes are needed to increase the cyclability of PRAMs.  
 
Key words：Fast-Growth Sb70Te30, electro-thermal property, crystallization kinetics, melting

1. Introduction 
 
Electronic nonvolatile Phase-change Random Access Memory (PRAM) is considered to 
be the most promising candidate for next-generation solid state memory. [1-3] Chalcogenide 
recording materials used in PRAMs can be programmed reversibly between the amorphous 
(RESET or “0”) and crystalline (SET or “1”) states on a time scale of nanoseconds by sending 
different electric pulses. The pronounced differences in electrical resistivity between the two 
states can be used to read and record data. Up to now, most researches used either pulsed 
current or voltage to switch data with different PRAM materials, structures, and 
manufacturing feature sizes. However, the RESET current is usually much higher than the 
upper limit that CMOS components can provide, and the voltage pulses will substantially 
decrease the endurance of PRAMs. It is shown that additional heating materials, such as the 
oxygen additive TiN (TiNO) and the amorphous carbon (a-C), can modify the recording 
behaviors of PRAMs. [4] Nonetheless, it is not clear how these heating materials affect the 
phase-change behaviors and operation conditions of PRAMs. In this study, we quantitatively 
investigated the effects of TiNO layers with different oxygen concentration and a-C layers 
with different film thickness on the crystallization and melting kinetics of Sb70Te30 phase- 
change recording and on the operation conditions in PRAMs. The crystalline structures of the 
fast-growth Sb70Te30 recording films with different heating layers under thermal annealing at 
different temperatures were analyzed. The operation conditions for the PRAM cells were also 
estimated by the electro-thermal finite-element analyses.  
 
2. Results and Discussion  
 
The Sb70Te30 recording film with and without an additional a-C or TiNO heating layer 
were prepared. The thickness of the Sb70Te30 recording film was controlled at ~60 nm, while 
the additional a-C heating layer with different thicknesses of ~35 and ~75 nm were fabricated. 
The chemical compositions of TiNO heating layers prepared at Ar/N2/O2 gas mixtures of 
9.1/9.1/0, 15.0/4.5/0.5, and 13.5/5.3/0.7 were estimated to be Ti33N49O18, Ti31N22O47, and 
Ti27N14O59, respectively by EDS. The electrical resistivities were measured to be 8.76×10-11, 
2.16×10-5, 2.20×10-5, and 1.43×10-5 TΩ-μm for the Ti33N49O18, Ti31N22O47, Ti27N14O59, and 
a-C films, respectively. It is evident that the electrical resistivity of TiNO films increased 
substantially with increasing the oxygen concentration. The electrical resistivities of the a-C 
and TiNO films are listed in Table I.  
In order to evaluate the effects of the additional a-C or TiNO heating layer on the phase 
change behaviors of Sb70Te30 recording film, the reflectivity variations with temperature for 
the Sb70Te30 recording film with an additional a-C and TiNO under layer at a heating rate of 
10 oC/min were measured, as shown in Figures 1 (a) and (b), respectively. For the Sb70Te30 
recording film with and without a TiNO under layer, all the curves were found to exhibit a 
four-stage reflectivity change as the temperature was increased from room temperature to 550 
oC. The first reflectivity change with an abrupt rise in reflectivity was found to occur in the 
range from 145 to 170 oC, the second one with a slight reflectivity drop was observed in the 
temperature range from 265 to 400 oC, the third one with a small reflectivity jump was 
observed in the temperature range from 400 and 430 oC, and the fourth one with a steep 
was defined as the temperature at the beginning of reflectivity drop at the fourth stage. For the 
as-deposited Sb70Te30 recording film at a heating rate of 10 oC/min, the Tc and Tm were found 
to be 146 and 425 oC, respectively. For the as-deposited Sb70Te30 with an additional heating 
layer of a-C with the thickness of 35 and 75 nm, the Tc were found to be 167 and 168 oC and 
Tm were found to be 320 and 291 oC, respectively. For the as-deposited Sb70Te30 with an 
additional heating layer of Ti33N49O18, Ti31N22O47, and Ti27N14O59, Tc was found to be 157, 
158, and 159 oC, and Tm was found to be 422, 412, and 396 oC, respectively. The reduced 
temperature Tc/Tm was therefore calculated to be ~ 0.6 for all samples. Apparently, inserting 
a-C and TiNO heating layers under the Sb70Te30 recording film will result in the increase of 
crystallization temperature but decrease of melting temperature, while will remain the reduced 
temperature unchanged so that the archival stability and recording sensitivity of Sb70Te30 
recording film can be improved simultaneously.  
The activation energies for crystallization (Ec) and melting (Em) are other indexes to 
evaluate the archival stability and recording ability of phase change behaviors. To understand 
the effects of a-C and TiNO heating layers on the activation energies for crystallization and 
melting of the as-deposited Sb70Te30 recording film, a series of non-isothermal experiments 
were conducted at different constant heating rates. As expected, the corresponding Tc and Tm 
increased with increasing heating rates since less time is available for atomic rearrangements 
of the constituent elements, and less energy is obtained to break the atomic bonds. The 
relationships between the heating rates and the crystallization and melting temperatures can 
be expressed by the Kissinger’s formula: [9]  
ln(α/Tx2)=C - (Ea/RTx),  (1) 
Here α is the heating rate, Tx is the absolute crystallization or melting temperature, Ea is the 
activation energy for crystallization or melting, R is the gas constant, and C is a constant.  
Figure 3 (a) and (b) show the Kissinger’s plots for the Sb70Te30 recording films with and 
without a-C and TiNO heating layers. For the as-deposited pure Sb70Te30 recording film, the 
activation energies for crystallization (Ec) and melting (Em) were determined to be 1.86 and 
3.28 eV/atom, respectively. As a-C heating layers of 35 and 75 nm in thickness were inserted, 
Ec of Sb70Te30 recording film would significantly increase to 3.57 and 3.61 eV/atom, while Em 
would drastically decrease to 0.95 and 0.92 eV/atom, respectively. For the Sb70Te30 recording 
film with heating layers of Ti33N49O18, Ti31N22O47, and Ti27N14O59, Ec were increased to 1.93, 
2.18, and 2.50 eV/atom, and Em were decreased to 3.11, 2.70, and 2.09 eV/atom, respectively. 
Accordingly, the reduced activation energy (Ec/Em) of the Sb70Te30 recording films would 
increase from 0.57 to 0.62, 0.81, and 1.20, respectively, as the Ti33N49O18, Ti31N22O47, and 
Ti27N14O59 heating layers were adopted.  
The increase of crystallization temperature and activation energy for crystallization due 
to the incorporate of a-C and TiNO with Sb70Te30 can be explained by the confusion principle. 
[10] According to the confusion principle, an alloy system involving more elements will have 
a lower chance to select viable crystal structures and a higher chance of glass forming, and 
therefore, will be more resistant to crystallization. Since the elements diffused from the a-C or 
TiNO heating layer made the Sb70Te30 alloy too confused to crystallize, the samples with a-C 
or TiNO heating layer thus exhibit higher crystallization temperatures than the pure Sb70Te30 
alloy. In addition, Senkov and Miracle have reported that an alloying element with a size 
smaller than the matrix atoms can occupy both interstitial and substitutional sites and produce 
attractive short-range order complexes. These interstitial and substitutional atoms attract each 
other and produce short-range ordered atomic configurations that stabilize the amorphous 
state. [11] Therefore, the melting temperature (Tm) and activation energy for melting (Em) 
could be expected to decrease with increasing the content of the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen 
atoms with vary small atomic radius that will occupy more interstitial and substitutional sites 
in the Sb70Te30 recording film.   
a crystalline Sb70Te30 (c-ST) recording layer and an additional a-C heating layer with various 
thicknesses. All curves show exponential increases in Tmax with increasing Ireset. The minimum 
Ireset were estimated to be 20.2, 11.3, 8.2 μA, as the thicknesses of the a-C heating layers were 1, 
3, and 6 nm, respectively. The Ireset was found to decrease with increasing the thickness of the 
a-C heating layer. These values were very small compared with PRAM cells without an 
additional a-C layer (~1 mA). Figure 5 (b) shows the Tmax as a function of Vreset for PRAMs 
adopting a c-ST recording layer and an additional a-C heating layer with various thicknesses. 
Similarly, Tmax increases exponentially with increasing Vreset. The minimum Vreset were 
estimated to be 7.3, 11.8, and 16.6 V, as the thicknesses of the a-C heating layers were 1, 3, 
and 6 nm, respectively. The Vreset was found to increase with increasing the thickness of the 
a-C heating layer due to the lower heating efficiencies of Vreset on thicker a-C layers having 
high resistivity.  
Figure 6 (a) shows the Tmax as a function of Iset for PRAMs with an amorphous Sb70Te30 
(a-ST) recording layer and an additional a-C heating layer with various thicknesses. The 
minimum Iset were estimated to be 9.6, 5.7, and 4.0 μA, respectively, as the thicknesses of the 
a-C heating layers were 1, 3, and 6 nm. The minimum Iset can be decreased with increasing 
the thickness of the a-C heating layer. As the recording films crystallized, the curves will not 
follow the exponential increase in Tmax with further increasing Iset due to the large 
dissimilarities in resultant potential difference and heating efficiency between crystalline and 
amorphous states. The maximum Iset (Tmax ~ Tm) will switch to the minimum Ireset forming a 
broader current SET operation window. Figure 6 (b) shows the Tmax as a function of SET 
voltages (Vset) for PRAMs with a-ST layer and an additional a-C heating layer with various 
thicknesses. The minimum Vset were estimated to be 7.3, 11.8, and 16.6 V, as the thicknesses 
of the a-C heating layers were 1, 3, and 6nm, respectively. The Vset was found to increase with 
increasing the thickness of the a-C heating layer. The minimum required operation conditions 
for various PRAMs adopting a-C heating layer with different thickness were summarized in 
Table IV.  
In order to evaluate the feasibility of the PRAMs adopting different TiNO electrodes 
with various oxygen concentrations, the 1T/1R PRAM vertical cell structure were used, as 
shown in Fig. 7 (a), which consists of a W top electrode contact (TEC), a TiNO top electrode 
(TE), a phase change layer (PC), a TiNO bottom electrode contact (BEC), and a W plug with 
dimensions provided in the figure. A simulation result can be seen in Fig. 7 (b). Figure 8 (a) 
shows the Tmax as a function of RESET currents (Ireset) for PRAMs with a c-ST recording layer 
and various TiNO electrodes. All curves show exponential increases in Tmax with increasing 
Ireset. The minimum Ireset were estimated to be 1547.9, 3.2, 3.1 μA, respectively, as the Ti33N49O18, 
Ti31N22O47, and Ti27N14O59 layers were adopted. The Ireset was found to substantially decrease 
with increasing the oxygen concentration in TiNO electrodes. Figure 8 (b) shows the Tmax as a 
function of Vreset for PRAMs with c-ST layer and various TiNO electrodes. Similarly, Tmax 
increases exponentially with increasing Vreset. The minimum Vreset were estimated to be 0.4, 
208.7, and 209.8 V, respectively, as the Ti33N49O18, Ti31N22O47, and Ti27N14O59 layers were 
adopted. The Vreset was found to substantially increase with increasing the concentration of 
oxygen in TiNO electrodes due to the lower heating efficiency of Vreset on TiNO layers having 
high resistivity. Figure 9 (a) shows the Tmax as a function of Iset for PRAMs with an a-ST 
recording layer and various TiNO electrodes. The minimum Iset were estimated to be 35.3, 1.6, 
and 1.5 μA, respectively, as the Ti33N49O18, Ti31N22O47, and Ti27N14O59 layers were adopted. 
The minimum Iset can be decreased with increasing the oxygen concentration in TiNO layers. 
As the recording films crystallized, the curves will not follow the exponential increase in Tmax 
with further increasing Iset due to the large dissimilarities in resultant potential difference and 
heating efficiency between crystalline and amorphous states. The maximum Iset (Tmax ~ Tm) 
will switch to the minimum Ireset forming a broader Iset operation window. Figure 9 (b) shows

Abstract—Large-scale amorphous SiO2 nanoblades with typical 
widths of 300-600 nm, thickness of a few tens of nm, and lengths 
up to 12 m have been synthesized on a silicon substrate covered 
with a 100-nm-thick crystalline SiO2 buffer layer in a controlled 
aqueous solution. Intense blue luminescence centered at 3.0 and 
2.8 eV was observed in the as-synthesized SiO2 nanoblades. The 
2.8-eV band can be attributed to the paramagnetic E’ defects 
and/or the neutral oxygen-vacancy defects, and the 3.0-eV band 
may be due to the H-complexed oxygen vacancies, twofold 
coordinated silicon centers, and/or weak O-O bonds.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
One-dimensional (1D) silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanostructures 
have attracted great attention because of their unique 
photoluminescence properties and potential applications in 
high-intensity light sources, low dimensional waveguides, 
high-resolution optical heads of scanning near-field optical 
microscope, and nanointerconnections in future integrated 
optoelectronic devices.[1] Different approaches, such as 
excimer laser ablation, thermal evaporation, carbothermal 
reduction, catalyzed thermal decomposition, and vapor-liquid-
solid (VLS) catalytic growth have been used for synthesis of 
various SiOx nanostructures.[1-4] However, these methods 
usually require extremely high reaction temperature (>1150oC) 
so that they are incompatible with low-cost flexible substrates. 
Accordingly, a solution-based growth process at a relatively 
low temperature might be a better choice for the fabrication of 
1D SiO2 nanostructures. In this work, we synthesized large-
scale SiO2 nanoblades with widths of 300-600 nm, thickness of 
a few tens of nm, and lengths up to 12 m in an aqueous 
solution at a temperature as low as 80oC. The PL spectra of the 
as-synthesized amorphous SiO2 nanoblades exhibited intense 
blue luminescence at energies of 2.8 and 3.0 eV at room 
temperature.  
II. EEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
Large-scale SiO2 nanoblades were synthesized by a one-
step hydrothermal process. An aqueous solution consisting of 
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), (NH2)2CO, and NaOH was prepared 
and contained in a closed Pyrex bottle with an autoclavable 
screw cap. A crystalline SiO2 buffer layer 100 nm thick was 
deposited on silicon substrates and then annealed at 900oC for 1 
hr. The silicon substrates were placed standing against the 
walls of the closed Pyrex bottle, and the bottle was placed in a 
regular oven and heated at a constant temperature of 80, 85, 90 
and 95oC for 24h. The as-synthesized thin films were 
subsequently dried in air. The microscopic morphologies of the 
resultant films were observed with a field-emission scanning 
electron microscope (FE-SEM). The structures and constituent 
phases of the as-synthesized films were characterized by an x-
ray diffractometer (XRD), a transmission electron microscope 
(TEM) equipped with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy 
(EDS), and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using 
Mg radiation. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were 
measured at room temperature in the spectral range of 350-800 
nm using a He-Cd laser with a wavelength of 325 nm as the 
excitation source. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 
measurements were performed at room temperature on an X-
band (~ 9.871 GHz) Bruker EMX-10/12 spectrometer. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Figs. 1(a) to 1(d) show representative FE-SEM images of 
the as-synthesized films revealing the general morphology of 
the SiO2 nanostructures. Clearly, large-scale and 1D SiO2 
nanoblades with widths of 300-600 nm, thickness of a few tens 
of nm, and lengths up to 12 m can be synthesized on the 
silicon substrate covered with a crystalline SiO2 buffer layer. 
As the synthesis temperature was increased from 80 to 95 oC, 
the widths would decrease from 1 m to 200 nm, but the 
lengths would increase from few m to more than ten m. Fig. 
2(a) and 2(b) show a typical TEM image and the EDS spectrum 
of the as-synthesized SiO2 nanoblades prepared at 95 oC. The 
highly dispersed selected area electron diffraction (SAED) 
patterns reveal that the as-synthesized SiO2 nanoblades are of a 
completely amorphous state. According to the EDX spectrum 
measured with the same TEM system, the elemental 
compositions of the as-synthesized nanoblades were verified to 
be Si and O with an approximate atomic ratio of 1:2, which 
confirms that the nanoblades are primarily SiO2.  
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) show the core-level spectra of Si (2p) 
and O (1s), respectively, for the as-synthesized nanoblades. All 
peak positions were corrected by the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV, 
which was due to contamination on the grown film. No obvious 
Si (2p) peaks corresponding to the binding energies for Si were 
observed. The Si (2p) and O (1s) peaks at the binding energies 
of 102.9 eV and 532.4 eV, respectively, confirm that the as-
synthesized nanoblades are SiO2.[3]

defects are formed during the growth process. The zero-
crossing g value was calculated to be 2.0000 and the spin 
density is about 9.9 x 106/cm2. This means that the 
paramagnetic defects should be the E’ defect centers,[6] which 
is a Si dangling bond, and is a nonradiative recombination 
center.[7] Therefore, the 2.8-eV band observed in the as-
synthesized SiO2 nanoblades can be contributed to the 
recombination of electrons trapped in E’ defect level inside the 
band gap with holes in the valence band. It should be noted that 
in a silica glass, two E’ defect centers, each consisting of one 
silicon atom and three oxygen atoms can be joined together by 
a neutral oxygen-vacancy defects (VOX), which is consistent 
with the model structure proposed by Tohmom et al. for the ab 
initio molecular-orbital calculations.[8] Accordingly, it is 
possible that the 2.8-eV band can also be caused by a triplet-to-
ground transition of a neutral oxygen-vacancy defect. For the 
3.0-eV band, Nishikawa et al. also suggested that it may be due 
to twofold coordinated silicon long-pair centers (O-Si-O) or the 
weak O-O bonds.[7] However, Afanas’ev and Stesmans 
suggested that the H-complexed oxygen vacancies (≡Si· HSi≡) 
in SiO2 is responsible for the PL band at 3.0 eV.[9] Because the 
SiO2 nanoblades were synthesized by a hydrothermal process 
in an aqueous solution consisting of TEOS, urea, and NaOH, 
the formation of H-complexed oxygen vacancies can be 
expected. Accordingly, the PL band at 3.0 eV observed in the 
as-synthesized SiO2 nanoblades can be attributed to the 
combining contributions from the twofold coordinated silicon 
centers, weak O-O bonds, and H-complexed oxygen vacancies.

nanoblades prepared at various temperatures and (b) for the SiO2 nanoblades 
before and after oxygen annealing at 400 and 600 oC for 1h. 
 
Fig. 4(a) shows room-temperature PL spectra of the as-
synthesized SiO2 nanoblades prepared at various temperatures, 
where the excited wavelength is 325 nm. Intense blue 
luminescence centered at around 410 nm (3.0 eV) and 440 nm 
(2.8 eV) was observed in all spectra and the PL peak intensity 
decreased with increasing the synthesis temperature. For 
comparison, the 100-nm-thick SiO2 buffer layer on Si substrate 
after annealing was tested and no peak was detected at the 
range of blue light wavelength. Similar blue light emissions 
were also observed in amorphous SiO2 nanowires grown by 
excimer laser-ablation technique and catalyzed thermal 
decomposition, which has been attributed to defect centers of 
oxygen deficiency in the wires.[1,5] To confirm that the blue 
luminescence in SiO2 nanoblades is related with the presence 
of oxygen vacancies, the as-synthesized SiO2 nanoblades were 
subjected to oxygen annealing at 300 and 600 oC for 1 h and 
then measured their photoluminescence spectra, as shown in 
Fig. 4(b). The PL peak intensities for the SiO2 nanoblades were 
found to reduce by ~ 21 and 44%, respectively, after oxygen 
annealing at 300 and 600 oC, suggesting that the intense blue 
luminescence observed in as-synthesized SiO2 nanoblades is 
related to the presence of oxygen vacancies. It is believed that 
pre-existing defects, or impurities introduced during sample 
preparation are responsible for these luminescence bands. To 
clarify the types of defects in the as-synthesized SiO2 
nanoblades, the EPR spectrum was measured, as shown in Fig. 
5. Obvious EPR signals were observed in the as-synthesized 
SiO2 nanoblades, indicating that some kind of paramagnetic 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
We have synthesized large-scale SiO2 nanoblades with 
widths of 300-600 nm, thickness of a few tens of nm, and 
lengths up to 12 m in an aqueous solution at a temperature of 
95 oC. The structure of the as-synthesized nanoblades was 
confirmed to be amorphous SiO2. The PL spectrum of the as-
synthesized SiO2 nanoblades exhibited intense blue 
luminescence centered at 410 nm (3.0 eV) and 440 nm (2.8 eV), 
and the EPR spectrum confirmed the presence of the E’ defect 
centers. The 2.8-eV band is attributed to the paramagnetic E’ 
defects and/or the neutral oxygen-vacancy defects, and the 3.0-
eV band may be due to the H-complexed oxygen vacancies, 
twofold coordinated silicon centers, and/or weak O-O bonds.
