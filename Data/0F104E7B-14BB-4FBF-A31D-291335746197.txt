However, the theory of fracture mechanics 
was not used in [8-10]. More realistic model 
should be analyzed to estimate complicated 
fracture situations and repair performances. In 
this report, two-dimensional finite element 
analyses of the active repair for cracked 
structures by using multi-layered piezoelectric 
patches are studied. The linear elastic fracture 
mechanics and strain energy density theory [11] 
are adopted to estimate the repair performance. 
New results of the active repair are obtained 
from the plane strain model. Effects of geometry 
and other conditions on repair performances are 
discussed in this study. 
 
 
2.  Problem statements  
2.1. Problem definitions 
The cantilever bending model to be 
analyzed and its dimensions are shown in Fig. 1. 
The plane strain assumption is used in this 
analysis. The rectangular structure contains a 
vertical edge crack with the length a. The 
structure is subjected to a force F on the free 
end and the crack tends to be open. To reduce 
the crack opening displacement, the 
piezoelectric patch is attached on the bottom 
surface of the structure. The applied voltage Va 
between electrodes of the patch will cause the 
piezoelectric deformation to resist against the 
bending effect from the force F. As a result, the 
crack can be closed.  Figure 2 shows two types 
of piezoelectric patches used in this study. The 
poling of the single-layered piezoelectric patch 
is the positive y-direction. The multi-layered 
patch contains many pairs of opposite poling 
directions (+y and –y poling). The electric field 
made from applied voltage Va is opposite to the 
poling direction so that this d31-type 
piezoelectric patch will expand in the 
x-direction. The thickness of the electrode is 
very thin so that its stiffness is neglected in the 
analysis. The specified values for all analyses 
are H=0.02 m, L=0.08 m and F=100 N/m. Other 
dimensions will be design parameters for 
analyses and discussions. 
The materials of the cracked structure and 
patch are PMMA plastics and PZT-4 
piezoelectric ceramic, respectively. PMMA is 
assumed as an isotropic material. The 
constitutive relation of the piezoelectric ceramic 
with z-axis (or x3-axis) poling is:

Equation (1) is transversely isotropic for the 
PZT-4 piezoelectric ceramic. The electro-elastic 
field quantities include the normal stress σ, 
shear stress τ, normal strain ε, shear strain γ, 
electric displacement D, and electric field E. 
The material constants c, κ, and e are the elastic 
stiffness constant, permittivity, and piezoelectric 
constant, respectively. Table 1 lists all material 
constants [12,13] used in this paper.  
The finite element software ANSYS is 
employed in this study. However, it must be 
noted that the positions of shear stresses, shear 
strains and associated material constants in the 
matrices of Eq. (1) are different from the 
definitions of ANSYS [12]. All material 
constants in Table 1 must be transformed to 
ANSYS input definitions and specified poling 
direction. In addition, each permittivity in Table 
1 is converted to the relative permittivity for the 
input of ANSYS.  
 
2.2. Finite element models   
Figure 3 shows the finite element model 
created in ANSYS with the following 
dimensions: H=0.02 m, L=0.08 m, a=0.5H, 
L1=L/2, p1=p2=H/1.5, and δ=0.25H (10-layered 
patch). The cracked structure and piezoelectric 
patch are modeled by ANSYS element types: 
PLANE82 and PLANE223, respectively. Both 
element types are 8-node plane strain 
isoparametric elements. The model in Fig. 3 
contains 864 elements and 2735 nodes. It is 
remarkable that the quarter-point elements [14] 
are used for modeling the r−1/2 singularity at the 
crack tip. From the results of the finite element 
analysis near the crack tip, the stress intensity 
factors and strain energy density factors are 
obtained to determine fracture behavior of the 
crack tip. The methods of fracture mechanics 
will be described in the next section.  
All boundary conditions used in the finite 
 4
density factor Smin. 
(2) The crack will extend when Smin reaches a 
critical value Scr that is a material property.  
From hypothesis (1), the necessary and 
sufficient conditions for S to be a minimum Smin 
are 
0=∂θ
∂S  ,  02
2
>∂θ
∂ S            (7) 
By Eq. (7), the angle θ0 for Smin which also 
corresponds to the direction of maximum 
potential energy is a position of unstable 
equilibrium. This angle is the direction of crack 
propagation and the value S at θ = θ0 is defined 
as Smin.  
 
3.3. Repair criterion in this study 
In this paper, the crack is thought to be 
repaired while both crack surfaces contact to 
each other by the actuation of the piezoelectric 
patch with the repair voltage Var. From the finite 
element simulations, the crack closure and Var 
can be determined while the contact stress on 
the crack occurs.   
By the use of active repair technology, Smin 
at the crack tip can be reduced to prevent from 
unpredictable monotonic or fatigue crack 
propagation. Although the crack can be closed 
by the active repair, it may not come true to 
make the crack fully closed near the crack tip. 
However, very high voltage for the piezoelectric 
patch may be required to make the crack fully 
closed and it is not safe and economical. On the 
other hand, the value of Smin is low enough 
while both crack surfaces contact to each other. 
Due to above reasons, the repair criterion 
mentioned before is defined for this analysis. 
   
4. Results and discussions 
4.1. Validations of the finite element model 
In parametric studies, the same local 
mesh around the crack tip in Fig. 3(b) is used 
for all finite element models. The validation of 
the finite element model must be confirmed 
first. A typical mode-I model for cracked 
PMMA structure without repair is shown in 
Fig. 6. The dimensions are L1=L/2 and a=0.5H. 
This model is assumed as plane strain and 
subjected to a pair of bending moments M=2 
N-m/m. The finite element result k1=4496.93 
Pa m  has good agreement with the boundary 
collocation solution k1= 4483.5 Pa m  in [17] 
under 0.3% error.  
 
4.2. Basic studies 
Figure 2 depicts single-layered and 
multi-layered piezoelectric actuators as active 
patches to repair the crack. The repair 
performances of single-layered (n=1) and 
ten-layered (n=10) patches are compared in 
this section. Both patches have the same total 
thickness δ=0.25H. Other geometric 
dimensions are a=0.5H, p1=p2=H/1.5 and 
c=δ/10. Frictionless contact on crack surfaces 
is first considered in the finite element 
analysis. 
When the external force F is applied on 
the structure, the crack is open. For the cracked 
structure without the piezoelectric patch, 
Figures 7 and 8 show the variations of stress 
intensity factors k1 and k2 , and the minimum 
strain energy density factors Smin with different 
crack location L1. The values of k1 and Smin 
decrease when L1 increases. The opening mode 
(mode-I) dominates the crack behaviors in this 
study.  
When the piezoelectric patch is bonded 
on the structure without applying any external 
voltage (Va=0), the values of k1, k2 and Smin can 
be reduced by the stiffness of the piezoelectric 
patch. This repair effect is a passive repair 
similar to the traditional bonded repair 
although the patch in this study is not bonded 
directly on the crack. The passive repair 
performances of one-layered and ten-layered 
piezoelectric patches are the same because of 
the same total thickness and zero voltage. 
Reductions of k1/k1o, k2/k2o and Smin/Smino due to 
the passive repair are shown in Fig. 9. The 
symbols k1o, k2o and Smino express the values of 
the original cracked structure without patch 
bonding, i.e. the values from Fig. 7 and 8. In 
Fig. 9, the reduction of Smin increases when L1 
increases. All reductions of Smin are smaller 
than 20%. 
While the voltage Va is applied on the 
electrodes, the piezoelectric patch expands in 
the x-direction and causes the structure to bend 
and let the crack close. According to the repair 
criterion, Figure 10 shows the values of the 
repair voltage Var with different crack location 
L1. When L1 is small, it requires larger Var for 
repair due to larger bending moment. For each 
 6
modified. For this modified case, the axial 
expansion of the bimorph is larger with the 
thinner thickness under a constant V. In this 
paper, the piezoelectric patch is an 
axial-expansion-type actuator. The larger 
expansion produced by the thinner thickness of 
the piezoelectric patch will assist the bending 
of the cracked structure to resist the crack 
opening. In other words, the required voltage is 
smaller for the thinner patch to repair the 
crack. 
The results in Fig. 17 are opposite to 
those in [8]. It may be due to different poling 
directions of piezoelectric patches in both 
papers.   
  
4.6. Effects of patch length 
The conditions of analyses in this section 
are a=0.5H, n=10, c=δ/10 and µ=0. Figures 18 
and 19 show the repair voltage Var with 
different patch length p1 or p2 under various L1. 
For shorter patch length, Var can be reduced by 
increasing p1 or p2. When the length is long 
enough, p1 or p2 has few effects on the repair 
voltage. It shows that too long patch is useless 
for reducing the repair voltage.  
By comparing Fig. 18 with 19 for the 
same crack location L1, it is found that the 
value of Var by increasing p1 is smaller than 
that by increasing p2. It is a better way to 
increase p1 for reducing Var. 
 
4.7. Effects of crack length 
In this section, geometric dimensions are 
L1=0.04m, n=10, p1=p2=H/1.5, c=δ/10 and µ=0. 
In Fig. 20, the values of Var with different 
crack length a under various δ are plotted. 
When the crack length becomes longer, larger 
Var is required for the active repair.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Using numerical fracture mechanics, the 
active repair performances of multi- layered 
piezoelectric patches for repairing cracked 
structures have been studied. Plane strain finite 
element models are adopted in this report. The 
contact conditions on both crack surfaces are 
considered in simulations and the repair 
voltage Var can be determined. If the crack 
contact is neglected, penetration between both 
crack surfaces occurs so that incorrect results 
are obtained.  
Lower repair voltage is better because it 
is low-energy-consuming and safer for the 
operations. The better design choices for the 
piezoelectric patch are as follows: increasing 
the layer number, increasing the patch length, 
and reducing the patch thickness. However, it 
is not a good idea to use higher input voltage 
that is larger than Var because it will enlarge 
the crack open near the crack tip. Also, too 
long patch length has no advantage for the 
active repair. 
Finite element simulations help us to 
understand the active repair behaviors in detail. 
Not only the design guides of the piezoelectric 
patch are provided here, but also the numerical 
results are provided for comparing with the 
future experimental data.
