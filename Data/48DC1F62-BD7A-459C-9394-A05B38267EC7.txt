1. INTRODUCTION  
Erbium-doped materials have been extensively utilized in the optical communication system because the 
Er3+ ions excited by 980 nm photons can emit ~1.54 μm photons which are in the region of the optimum 
transmission of silica-based glass fibers [1]. Additionally, erbium-doped materials also have the good 
upconversion (UC) property for the application in upconversion lasers [2]. In recent years, the erbium-doped 
materials have attracted the specific attention on the application of the luminescent solar converter (LSC) 
because of the visible (VIS) upconversion property [3-6]. Generally, LSC is a transparent organic or ceramic 
fluorescent thin film which is doped or blended by organic dyes [7], rare earth (Re) activators [8], silicon 
nanocrystals [9], or quantum dots [10,11] on the top or bottom of solar cells. It can absorb the ultraviolet (UV) 
light and emit the VIS light by the downconversion mechanism, or absorb the infrared (IR) light and emit the 
VIS light by the upconversion mechanism [12]. Shalav et al. reported that the silicon solar cell in combination 
with the NaYF4:Er3+ UC-phosphors gave an external quantum efficiency close to 2.5±0.2% under 5.1 mW 
laser excitation at 1523 nm [4]. 
Basically, the multiphonon relaxation process is directly related to the phonon energy of host materials, 
which can considerably influence the photoluminescence (PL) properties [13]. Low phonon-energy materials 
such as Y2O3 [14,15], Gd2O3 [16,17], ZrO2 [18,19], and YAlO3 [20,21] prevent the dexcitation of the 
excited-state levels through the nonradiative phonon-assisted relaxation, resulting in the strongly enhanced 
luminescence intensity for the IR-to-VIS upconversion. Pyrochlore-phase dititanate Y2Ti2O7 possesses a 
face-centered cubic crystal structure with the space group Fd3m (lattice constant, a=10.09 nm) [22,23], high 
refractive index (2.34 at λ=563 nm) [24], high optical band gap (~3.7 eV) [25,26], and low phonon energy 
(<712 cm-1) [27]. Because Y3+ and Er3+ ions have similar ionic radii (Y3+=0.0892 nm and Er3+=0.0881 nm), as 
well as Y2Ti2O7 and Er2Ti2O7 have the same crystal structural and similar lattice constant, Er3+ ions can 
replace Y3+ ions in the Y2Ti2O7 lattice, implying that both Y3+ and Er3+ ions in Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 are 
structurally indistinguishable. Therefore, Y2Ti2O7 is a very good candidate for Er3+ doping, and Er3+ ions 
should distribute very well in the Y2Ti2O7 lattice, resulting in the reduction of the concentration quenching 
effect and the increase of the PL intensity. Additionally, the Y2Ti2O7 host possessing lower phonon energy 
than do silica-based glasses can reduce the possibility of nonradiative recombination and increase the 
upconversion luminescence intensity of Er3+ ions. 
   In this paper, Er3-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals were fabricated by the sol-gel method which is a very easy 
technique to fabricate nanocrystals with homogeneous dispersion and the precisely desired stoichiometry of 
 
 
spectrophotometer was accurately fixed for each measurement. The response of the detection system was 
precisely calibrated with a tungsten wire calibration source. The decay curves of VIS and IR emissions were 
obtained by modulating the 980 nm laser at 15 Hz with a chopper, and the outputs of the photomultiplier tube 
and InGaAs photodiode were recorded by a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, DPO 3032). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Crystal structure 
    Figure 1 shows the TGA and DSC curves of Er3+ (5 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 xerogel powders. The TGA 
curve shows a significant weight loss in the temperature range from room temperature (RT) to 757 °C. A 
significant weight loss is observed below 350 °C due to the evaporation of physically adsorbed water and 
residual organic solvents. The weight loss corresponding to the decomposition/combustion of organic 
components and the formation of amorphous pyrochlore phase is at the temperature range of 350–725 °C. The 
crystallization of amorphous pyrochlore phase occurs at 725–757 °C. A slight increase in mass (1.3%) 
between 440 and 572 °C could be due to the additional pick-up CO2 from the atmosphere [28]. No weight loss 
was observed as the sample was heated over 757 °C, which implies that the thermally stabilized and 
well-crystallized pyrochlore phase Er3+ (5 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals had formed. In addition, it can 
be seen that a weak endothermal peak at 335 °C is ascribed to the evaporation of physically adsorbed water 
and a weak exothermal peak at 757 °C is related to the crystallization of the amorphous pyrochlore phase in 
the DSC curve.  
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in figures 2(a) and (b) show the effect of the annealing temperature 
on the phase evolution of Er3+ (5 or 10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals. Obviously, a weak broad 
continuum around 2θ=~30° in the XRD patterns is the characteristic of an amorphous structure for the 
samples annealed at 600 and 700 °C. While the annealing temperature exceeds 800 °C, the well-crystallized 
pyrochlore phase is identified by the characteristic XRD peaks: (222), (400), (440), and (622) [29]. On the 
other hand, other samples [Er3+ (3 or 7 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7] also exhibit the same effect of the annealing 
temperature on the phase evolution and the XRD patterns are similar to Figs. 2(a) and (b) (not shown here). 
All the XRD patterns indicate the formation of only a single pyrochlore phase without any possible other 
phases such as TiO2 (rutile phase), Y2O3, and Er2O3.  
Figures 2(c) and (d) show the XRD patterns of the Er3+ (3, 5, 7, or 10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals 
annealed at 800 or 1000 °C for 1 h. All of the samples possess the pyrochlore structure. Compared to the 
 
 
average grain size because of the limitation of diffractometer resolution. The discrepancy of average estimated 
grain size can be obviously observed in the SEM images. 
    The above-mentioned evolutions of the XRD peak intensities and crystal sizes of the Er3+ (3, 5, 7, or 10 
mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals annealed at 800-1000 °C obviously appear to be very similar. Er3+ ions 
can replace the positions of Y3+ ions in the Y2Ti2O7 lattice because Y3+/Er3+ ions have the same valance 
electrons and similar ionic radii as well as Y2Ti2O7/Er2Ti2O7 have the same crystal structural and similar 
lattice constant. Therefore, Y3+ and Er3+ ions are structurally undistinguished in the ErxY2-xTi2O7 lattice, 
which results in the very similar properties on the phase evolution and crystal growth for Er3+ (3, 5, 7, or 10 
mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals. 
 
3.2. Optical properties 
3.2.1. VIS-IR photoluminescence 
    Figures 4(a) and (b) show the upconversion and Stokes PL spectra of the Er3+ (5 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 
nanocrystals annealed at 600-1000 °C for 1 h and the Er3+ (3, 5, 7, or 10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals 
annealed at 800 °C for 1 h excited by 980 nm, respectively. These visible to infrared fluorescence spectra 
exhibit the bands at about 526, 547, 660, and 1528 nm which are identified as the 2H11/2→4I15/2, 4S3/2→4I15/2, 
4F9/2→4I15/2, and 4I13/2→4I15/2 transitions, respectively. Although ErxY2-xTi2O7 nanocrystals possessing lower 
phonon energy could induce UV and blue upconversion luminescence, no UV and blue light can be detected 
in our measurement system. This could be attributed to the very weak intensity of UV and blue upconversion 
luminescence which can not be detected due to the limitation of our existing experimental set-up. Or the 
nanocrystalline materials possess lots of absorbed contaminants (e.g., CO3- and OH-) on the surface and lattice 
defects, which results in the enhancement of nonradiative multiphonon decay and no UV/blue upconversion 
luminescence [14]. Therefore, this paper only focuses on the study of green, red, and infrared emissions of 
ErxY2-xTi2O7 nanocrystals. However, the more detailed UV-VIS fluorescence measurement will be executed 
by more delicate equipments in the near future. 
    The effect of the annealing temperature on the evolutions of VIS and IR PL intensities and spectral 
shapes of Er3+ (3, 7, or 10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals are similar to the case of Er3+ (5 mol%)-doped 
Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals (PL spectra not shown here). Obviously, 5 mol% and 800 °C are the optimum Er3+ 
doping concentration and annealing temperature for ErxY2-xTi2O7 system to achieve the maximum PL 
intensity, respectively. A broaden VIS and IR PL spectra consisting of some main peaks at 526, 547, 660 and 
 
 
upconversion effects are enhanced due to the reduced average spatial distance between Er3+ ions. In Y2Ti2O7 
there are eight molecules per unit cell, and the possible Y3+ sites for Er3+ ions to replace are 16. If we 
postulate that all Er3+ ions homogeneously distribute in the Y2Ti2O7 lattice for the Er3+ doping concentration 
of 1.09×1021 ions/cm3, the mean Er3+-Er3+ distance is approximately 1.027 nm. This quenching concentration 
(1.09×1021 ions/cm3) is larger than that of the traditional Er3+-doped SiO2 films [35,36].  
 
3.2.2. Photoluminescence lifetime 
    Figures 5(a)-(c) show the 547, 660 and 1528 nm PL decay curves of the Er3+ (3, 5, 7, or 10 mol%)-doped 
Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals annealed at 800 °C for 1 h under the excitation of 980 nm. For 3, 5, 7, and 10 mol% 
Er3+ doping concentrations the lifetimes of 1528 nm PL are 6.66, 4.50, 4.40, and 2.86 ms, respectively, which 
are similar to the reported values [37-39]. The 1528 nm PL decay curves of (3, 5, or 7 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 
nanocrystals are single-exponential; however, the decay curve slightly deviates from single exponentiality for 
(10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals. This means that for 3-7 mol% Er3+ doping concentrations most Er3+ 
ions are situated in similar sites. For 10 mol% Er3+ doping concentration, some Er3+ ions on the nanoparticle 
surface absorbing lots of CO3- and OH- quenching centers have faster decay than do those Er3+ ions located 
inside nanocrystals. The local environment of the Er3+ ions located close to the nanoparticle surface is 
different from that of those ions located inside nanocrystals, which leads to the reduced lifetime and slightly 
nonexponential decay curve. In addition, the enhanced energy-transfer mechanism between Er3+-Er3+ ions also 
can significantly reduce the lifetime of the sample with 10 mol% Er3+ doping concentration. 
The lifetimes of 547 nm upconversion emissions are all around 715 μs for the samples with 3, 5, 7, or 10 
mol% Er3+ doping concentration, and the decay curves of all samples are single-exponential. The energy gap 
ΔE between 2H11/2/4S3/2 and 4F9/2 levels is about 3100 cm-1, and only one OH- phonon can bridge this energy 
gap. Therefore, the presence of adsorbants on the nanocrystalline surface leads to a more efficient 
depopulation for 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels of Er3+ ions on surface. This implies that the Er3+ ions on surface could 
not dominate the green upconversion and the green upconversion mainly may come from the Er3+ ions inside 
nanocrystals. In addition, the single-exponential decay curves for all samples indicate that the chemical 
environment of most Er3+ ions for Er3+ (3-10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals are similar. In the other 
words, for the sample with 10 mol% Er3+ ions a certain proportion of Er3+ ions on the surface of nanocrystals 
could encounter the depopulation of 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels by multiphonon relaxtion. Therefore, Er3+ (10 
 
 
In order to investigate the possible up-converted emission mechanisms, we study the variation of the 
up-converted PL intensity by different excitation power (P) for the Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals with low 
and high Er3+ doping concentrations. For the Er3+ (5 or 10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals annealed at 
800 oC/1 h, the intensity of green and red upconversion luminescence (526, 547 and 660 nm) versus the pump 
power at 980 nm has been plotted in figure 7. The slopes of both green and red emissions for Er3+ (5 
mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals are approximately equal to 2 on a log-log scale during P ≦ 210 mW. 
This result confirms that green and red emissions belong to a two-photon absorption upconversion process 
[40-42]. However, the slopes of 526, 547 and 660 nm emissions for Er3+ (10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 
nanocrystals are 2.00, 1.99, and 1.80 during P ≦ 210 mW, respectively, indicating that the upconversion 
mechanism of green emission is a two-photon absorption process but red emission a little derives from the 
biphotonic case. Therefore, there exist some complex mechanisms for red emission. In addition, when 
pumping power is larger than 210 mW, intensity saturation occurs. For Er3+ (5 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 
nanocrystals, the slopes of green (526/547 nm) and red emissions reduce to 1.05/0.79 and 0.77, respectively. 
On the other hand, for Er3+ (10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals the slopes of green (526/547 nm) and red 
emissions also reduce to 1.39/1.17 and 0.90, respectively. The significantly reduced slope can be attributed to 
the competition between linear decay and upconversion process for the depletion of the intermediate excited 
states [43]. Similar phenomenon is also found in the Er3Al5O12 [44], Er3+-doped Y2O3 [45], or Er3+-doped 
BaTiO3 [46].  
    Schematic possible upconversion mechanisms of the Er3+ excited-state absorption (ESA), energy-transfer 
upconversion (ETU), and cross-relaxation (CR) under 980 nm pumping for low and high Er3+ doping 
concentrations are shown in figures 8(a) and (b). Generally, there are two kinds of mechanisms for the 
upconversion luminescence. One is the ESA and the other is the ETU [47-49]. Mechanism I is the general 
ESA mechanism. A 980 nm photon elevates an electron from the 4I15/2 level up to the 4I11/2 level and 
successively the electron in the 4I11/2 level can be excited further to the 4F7/2 level by another 980 nm photon, 
which results in the green and weaker red emissions. Mechanism II is another kind of the ESA mechanism. 
The electron in this 4I11/2 level relaxes to the 4I13/2 level through a multi-phonon relaxation and then the 4F9/2 
level is populated via the ESA of the electron in the 4I13/2 level, which leads to the red emission. Mechanism 
III is the general ETU mechanism related to the energy transfer between two Er3+ activators. The electron of 
one Er3+ activator absorbing one 980 nm photon is elevated to the 4I11/2 level. Then this excited electron which 
absorbs another 980 nm energy transferred from another neighboring Er3+ activator is further elevated to the 
 
 
1000 °C annealing for 1 h. 
    The Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals absorbing the 980 nm photons can produce the upconversion (526, 
547, and 660 nm; 2H11/2→4I15/2, 4S3/2→4I15/2 and 4F9/2→4I15/2, respectively) and Stokes (1528 nm; 4I13/2→4I15/2) 
photoluminescence. The optimum parameters for obtaining the maximum VIS and IR PL intensities of 
Er3+-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals is 5 mol% Er3+ doping concentration and 800 °C annealing temperature. The 
lifetimes of 547, 660, and 1528 nm PL emissions are 713 μs, 895 μs, and 4.5 ms, respectively, for 5 mol% 
Er3+ doping concentration, and the lifetimes of 547, 660, and 1528 nm PL emissions are 708 μs, 870 μs, and 
2.8 ms, respectively, for 10 mol% Er3+ doping concentration. In addition, the IR PL decay curve is 
single-exponential for 5 mol% Er3+ doping concentration but slightly nonexponential for 10 mol% Er3+ doping 
concentration. The shorter lifetime and slightly nonexponential decay curve of Er3+ (10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 
nanocrystals indicate that the reduced Er3+-Er3+ distance induces the concentration quenching effect and the 
local environments of Er3+ ions are a little different. 
    The Er3+ (5 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals excited by 980 nm can emit both green and red light via 
the two-photon excited-state absorption mechanism. For Er3+ (10 mol%)-doped Y2Ti2O7 nanocrystals, the 
green emission comes from both the two-photon excited-state absorption and energy-transfer upconversion 
mechanisms but the mechanism of red emission also involves the cross-relaxation which is enhanced by the 
reduced distance between Er3+-Er3+ ions except the two-photon excited-state absorption and energy-transfer 
upconversion mechanisms.

Abstract. Highly c-axis-oriented ZnO nanorods thin films were obtained on silica 
glass substrates by a simple solution-growth technique. The most compact and 
vertically-aligned ZnO nanorods thin film with the thickness of ~800 nm and average 
hexagonal grain size of ~200 nm exhibits the average visible transmittance 85%, 
refractive index 1.74, and packing density 0.84. As we demonstrate here, the 
solution-growth technique was used to produce high-quality and dense ZnO nanorods 
thin films, and is an easily controlled, low-temperature, low-cost, and large-scale 
process for the fabrication of optical-grade thin films. 
Introduction 
    ZnO is a direct band gap semiconductor with hexagonal wurzite crystal 
structure (a = 0.325 nm, c = 0.520 nm), and has a wide band gap of 3.37 eV at 300 K 
[1], large exciton binding energy of 60 meV [2], and high refractive index n550 nm = 
2.01. ZnO thin films have attracted many researchers to study because of its good 
optical and electrical characterizations for the applications to light-emitting diodes 
[3], field emitters [4], and solar cells [5]. 
    There are many methods for the fabrications of ZnO films such as metal-organic 
chemical vapor deposition [6], laser ablation [7], and sputtering [8]. However, most 
of technologies are correlated to the vacuum and high-temperature processes, which 
results in the high cost. In recent years, the solution-growth route has been used to 
fabricate the ZnO nanorods thin films [9-13]. It is noted that the surface morphology 
of ZnO nanorods thin films developed by Vayssieres et al. exhibited 
hexagonal-shaped nanorods and many unfilled inter-columnar voids between 
nanorods [10]. However, we found that hexagonal-shaped ZnO nanorods thin films 
with less voids can be synthesized under specific processing parameters and their 
optical properties are similar to that of ZnO films prepared by sputtering methods. 
Although there are extensive reports on the structural and physical properties of ZnO 
nanorods thin films prepared by solution methods, few reports are available on the 
preparations and characteristic investigations of high packing-density ZnO nanorods 
thin films. 
    In this study, we fabricated the dense and well-aligned ZnO nanorods thin films 
by the simple solution method. We believe that the dense and well-aligned ZnO 
nanorods thin films fabricated by solution-growth method can satisfy the basic 
diameters of 60-80 nm and the height of ~200 nm are very crowded and combined 
each other at side faces, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Further increase in growth 
time to 6 h causes the highly c-axis-oriented hexagonal ZnO grains (as shown in Fig. 
2 in the next section) to coalesce and form larger aggregated hexagonal grains with 
the average diameter of ~200 nm and the height of ~800 nm, resulting in the 
reduction of unfilled inter-columnar volume and voids [see Figs. 1(c) and 1(d)].

B. Crystal structure 
    Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZnO nanorods thin 
films fabricated under 75 °C, different growth time, and the ZnO seed layer with an 
average grain size of ~20 nm. Obviously, all of the XRD patterns exhibits only one 
diffraction peak and the peak position at ~34.53-34.57°, i.e. (002) is the 
characteristic of wurzite ZnO (JCPDS No. 36-1451). Hence, these ZnO nanorods 
thin films possess highly preferred orientation with c-axis normal to the substrate. 
The (002) plane in ZnO structure has the highest atomic density and possesses the 
lowest surface free energy. Therefore, the growth of a preferred c-axis oriented ZnO 
nanorod thin films can be easily driven at such low growth temperature.  
C. Optical property 
    Figures 3 show the optical transmittance spectra of ZnO nanorods thin films 
fabricated at 75 °C/1.5-6 h. The obvious interference fluctuation in the transmission 
spectra of ZnO nanorods thin films fabricated at 75 °C/1.5-6 h are due to the 
interference phenomena of multiple reflected beams between the three interfaces: 
air-ZnO nanorods film, ZnO nanorods film-silica glass, and silica glass-air. The 
average visible transmittance calculated in the wavelength ranging 400-800 nm of 
the ZnO nanorods thin films fabricated at 75 °C for 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 h are 87.9, 87.5, 
84.9, and 84.7%, respectively. Generally, there are three factors influencing the 
transmittance of ZnO nanorods thin films: (a) surface roughness, (b) defect centers, 
and (c) oxygen vacancies [15]. In our system, the decrease of transmittance for the 
ZnO nanorods thin films fabricated at 75 °C for 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 h with the 100-800 
nm in thickness could be related to two factors. One is the thicker ZnO nanorods thin 
films had larger hexagonal grain size and larger surface roughness. The other is the 
higher absorption effect for thicker films.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
    In conclusion, the fabrication of highly dense ZnO nanorods thin films are 
highly dependent on the different zinc ion concentrations, growth temperatures, 
growth time, growth routes, and ZnO seed-layer morphologies. The optimum 
solution-growth parameters are 0.05 M, 75 °C, 6 h, and ZnO seed layer with an 
average grain size of ~20 nm. It make the densest ZnO nanorods thin film with 
extremely C-axis orientation, compressive stress, average visible transmittance 85%, 
refractive index 1.74, and packing density 0.84. This low-temperature and low-cost 
solution method can be applied to fabricate the optical-grade ZnO thin films.
