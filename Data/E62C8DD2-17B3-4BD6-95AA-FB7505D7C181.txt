 We report the research and development progress and results with the implementation of the 
NSC project “Development of multi-function, integrated photonics and laser devices”. We aimed 
in this project at developing a series of novel and interesting photonics and laser devices based on 
the integration of the nonlinear-optic (NLO) and electro-optic (EO) properties of periodically and 
aperiodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN and APLN) crystals. These devices include an EO 
narrowband multi-wavelength filter and frequency doubler integrated in a monolithic APLN 
crystal and an EO Q-switch and intracavity frequency doubler integrated in a 
single-grating-structure APLN crystal. This study could be to the best of our knowledge the 
world’s first attempt on constructing an aperiodic QPM grating structure for optimally integrating 
both the NLO and EO properties of a material to enable high-efficiency dual optical device 
functions. 
 First we achieved the design and experimental characterization of APLN crystals for use in 
monolithically integrated dual nonlinear-optical devices. A cascade and a single 
aperiodic-domain-structure designs based on simulated annealing method were constructed in 
LiNbO3 to simultaneously perform as 4-channel electro-optically active (EOA) filters and 
4-channel frequency doublers in the telecom band. We found that we could obtain a 2.44-fold 
enhancement in second-harmonic-generation conversion efficiency and a 2.4-time reduction in 
filter transmission bandwidth with the single APLN device over the cascade one when the same 
device length of 2 cm and the EOA field of 1027 V/mm were used. 
We next achieved the design and experimental demonstration of an electro-optically 
Q-switched intracavity second harmonic generator (ISHG) based on a single APLN in a 1342-nm 
Nd:YVO4 laser. This intracavity APLN, designed using the aperiodic optical superlattice (AOS) 
technique, can perform simultaneously as a laser Q-switch and an SHG. At a ~200-V Q-switching 
voltage and a 5-kHz switching rate, we measured pulse energy of ~5.7 µJ and peak power of 
~700 W at 671 nm from the constructed ISHG with 5.2-W diode power based on 51% 
fundamental energy depletion. 
We have published 2 SCI papers, 4 international conference papers, and 1 local conference 
papers for reporting the research results relevant to this research work fully or partially supported 
by this NSC project. One Ph.D. dissertation and one master-degree thesis based on these research 
achievements have been accomplished. We kindly acknowledge NSC the support to this project 
(NSC 97-2221-E-008-030). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal has been demonstrated with its capability in electric modulation 
of the transmission power and temperature tuning of the transmission spectrum [4]. Since the 
signs of the crystal EO coefficients are periodically changed with crystal domains, such an EO 
PPLN filter can have a much simpler electrode design and use the full device length when 
compared to those traditional devices built on single-domain LiNbO3 [5, 6]. Under the NSC 
93-2215-E-008-036 project support, we have successfully implemented such EO PPLN filters in 
Ti-diffusion waveguides and have first experimentally demonstrated them as efficient optical 
wavelength filters and polarization mode converters [7-9]. As known, PPLN has been one of the 
most promising quasi-phase-matching (QPM) crystals in nonlinear frequency conversions [10]. 
The ingenious integration of the unique EO effects of a PPLN with its superiority in nonlinear 
frequency conversion could be a capable approach of advancing the development of many 
attractive monolithic multi-function devices, which is the very idea at constructing this work. 
 Unlike a uniform grating structure generally used in a PPLN crystal, an aperiodic domain 
structure is known to provide more than one reciprocal vector to simultaneously compensate 
wave-vector mismatches of a plurality of wave-energy coupling processes in a QPM material. 
Such a structure can be optimized for the prescribed multiple coupling processes and has been 
adopted to design a broadband QPM second-harmonic generation (SHG) process with the use of 
the simulated annealing (SA) method [11]. More recently, aperiodically poled lithium niobate 
(APLN) crystals have also been successfully demonstrated in generating equal-gain multiple 
SHG wavelengths [12]. The success of using an optimized aperiodic QPM medium to 
simultaneously perform multiple nonlinear wavelength conversions has inspired us to study the 
possibility and potential of using aperiodic QPM grating structures to achieve constructing 
efficient, multi-function nonlinear integrated photonics devices. In this work, we have studied, 
designed, fabricated, and demonstrated aperiodic QPM devices that can specifically 
simultaneously process multiple EO polarization-mode (EO PM) conversions based on our prior 
efforts on developing EO PPLN devices [7-9, 13]. Furthermore, we have also worked out a single 
aperiodic QPM structure that can simultaneously perform the prescribed nonlinear wavelength 
conversions and EO PM conversions. This could be to the best of our knowledge the world’s first 
attempt on constructing an aperiodic QPM grating structure for optimally integrating both the 
nonlinear optic (NLO) and electro-optic (EO) properties of a material to enable high-efficiency 
dual optical device functions. 
In this project, we have developed a series of multi-function, integrated photonics and laser 
devices based on the aforementioned NLO-EO APLN crystals. These devices are capable of 
simultaneously performing multi-wavelength filtering/polarization-mode conversion and 
frequency doubling in a single APLN crystal and are of potential for the optical communications 
and intracavity frequency doubling applications. In our design, when the APLN device functions 
as an active narrowband multi-wavelength filter, it is capable of simultaneously transmitting 
multiple International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standard wavelengths with equal and 
electro-optically variable transmittance. Interestingly, when such an APLN multi-wavelength 
filter was cascaded with an APLN SHG in a monolithic LiNbO3 crystal, we obtained a clean and 
peak-narrowed SHG spectrum from such a device as a result of the nonlinear conversion process. 
This improved transmission spectral quality can be beneficial to reduce the cross-talk limit and 
therefore increase the data transmission capacity of a telecommunication system. SHG of telecom 
and interesting photonics and laser devices based on the integration of the nonlinear-optic (NLO) 
and electro-optic (EO) properties of periodically and aperiodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN 
and APLN) crystals. In the past few years, we have successfully developed several integrated 
PPLN devices including a monolithic PPLN crystal as simultaneous a laser Q-switch and 
parametric generator, a monolithic Bragg PPLN crystal as simultaneous a laser Q-switch and 
parametric generator, a volume holographic PPLN device as an optical signal modulator, an EO 
Ti:PPLN waveguide as an optical wavelength filter and polarization mode converter, an EO 
APLN crystal as narrowband multi-wavelength filter, etc [7-9, 15-17, 28-35] under the support of 
NSC projects NSC 93-2215-E-008-036, 94-2215-E-008-019, 95-2221-E-008-161, and 
95-2120-M-001-006. These devices are of potential applications in optical communications, 
optical storages, biomedicine, displays, remote sensing, etc. To continue and extend these efforts 
and achievements, we further developed in this project several advanced integrated photonics and 
laser devices of capable of performing multiple optical functions based on QPM materials. They 
were realized upon the idea of manipulation of the engineerable domain structure of a QPM 
crystal to optimize performing the prescribed EO and NLO processes simultaneously to achieve 
the multi-function operation. In comparison with the research works studied in our prior NSC 
projects, this work involves to the best of our knowledge the first attempt on constructing an 
aperiodic QPM grating structure for integrating both the electro-optic and nonlinear optic 
properties of a material to enable multiple optical device functions. The development of novel 
multi-function, integrated photonics and laser devices and the demonstration of their superiority 
in device efficiency over the conventional devices has been the major objective to be pursued in 
this project: 
(1) The design, fabrication, and experimental demonstration of an APLN device for 
simultaneously being an electro-optic narrowband multi-wavelength filter/polarization-mode 
converter and a frequency doubler in the telecom bands. This could be the first design of a 
single QPM structure in optimally integrating dual optical device functions to achieve high 
device efficiency. A conventional cascaded APLN device has also been fabricated for 
performance comparison. 
(2) The development and proof-of-principle demonstration of an electro-optically Q-switched 
intracavity second-harmonic generation (SHG) Nd:YVO4 laser by using a 
single-grating-structure APLN crystal optimized for simultaneously performing a laser 
Q-switch and a second-harmonic generator. This could be the first demonstration of a single 
QPM structure in optimally integrating dual optical device functions to achieve 
high-efficiency laser Q-switched intracavity SHG. 
We have also studied the relevant theory and developed a calculation model for the generation 
of optimum APLN structures for performing the desired multiple nonlinear-optic coupling 
processes. These processes are the polarization mode (PM) conversions using the crystal EO 
effect or the wavelength conversions using the crystal NLO property or both conversions 
performed in a crystal. Due to the capability of simultaneous process of multiple optical signals 
and functions, these devices are of potential interest in applying to especially optical signal 
processing and communication systems.

4-channel frequency doubler, halving the 4 fundamental ITU wavelengths λ1-λ4. Since the design 
schemes (based on the AOS technique assisted by an optimization algorithm constructed using 
the simulated annealing (SA) method [11]) for both multi-channel devices are similar to those 
reported elsewhere [31, 12], it is not necessary to detail them again here. The main design 
parameters are included in a so-called objective function, which is a convergence criterion for 
guiding the SA algorithm [36] to best achieve the M designated efficiencies for the prescribed M 
coupling processes, given by

where η0(λi), η(λi), and w(λi) are the expected efficiency, the calculated efficiency for an AOS 
structure generated during the SA process, and the weighting factor at wavelength λi, respectively; 
the equalization factor β is an adjustable parameter for equalizing peak efficiencies and generally 
has a value falling in between 0 and 1 in our design; and the operators max[…] and min[…] yield 
the maximum and minimum values among all the values of the variable in the square brackets. 
The suffix EO or SHG denotes the coupling process for the EOA filter or SH generator, 
respectively. The efficiency ηEO represents the optical-power transmittance calculated for the 
APLN EOA filter [31], while ηSHG is the SHG conversion efficiency for the APLN SH generator 
[36] normalized to that of an ideal PPLN SHG device under the same pumping conditions and 
device length. 
Beyond the straightforward cascading scheme, the second device is designed to construct a 
single QPM-domain-structure APLN crystal for simultaneously performing the same dual device 
functions, i.e., the multi-wavelength filtering and frequency doubling. The design scheme for 
such a novel APLN device is similar to that for the cascade one, except the objective function has 
to be modified to be

where ηt, ws,EO, ws,SHG, βs,EO, βs,SHG are the expected overall efficiency for both EO and SHG 
processes, the weighting factor for the transmittance ηEO, the weighting factor for the efficiency 
ηSHG, the equalization factor for the peak transmittance of ηEO, and the equalization factor for the 
peak efficiency of ηSHG, respectively. Obviously, with such an objective function, one can 
arbitrarily choose an efficiency weighting ratio ws,EO/ws,SHG between the two device functions for 
the designated wavelengths in the SA algorithm to refine for an optimum QPM domain sequence 
for best performance of the desired conversions. Hereafter, we will refer to the cascade and single 
QPM-domain-structure APLN devices as the cascade and single APLN devices, respectively. 
In the AOS technique, a unit domain block of thickness ∆x is chosen as the building block 
for composing an optimal domain structure with the SA algorithm per the prescribed objective 
function. Since the 1st-order QPM domain thicknesses (≡ halves of the domain periods) required 
for operating a PPLN EOA Šolc-type filter and a PPLN SH generator in the telecom C band are 
around 10.6 and 9.5 µm [7, 37], respectively, a unit domain thickness ∆x sufficiently shorter than 
those domain thicknesses is desired to enhance the SA optimization result to work out the present 
domain structure to perform the prescribed quasi-phase-matching frequency conversions. Figure 
1(b) shows a further comparison of the SHG conversion efficiency (in %/W; normalized to the 
fundamental pumping power) of the two APLN devices calculated as a function of the 
fundamental wavelength. There is a clearly a prominent enhancement of the SHG conversion 
efficiency (up to 2.44-fold) in comparison with that of the cascade device (solid green line) which 
is obtained for all 4 gain-equalized SHG peaks with the single APLN device (dashed red line). 
The result of this efficiency enhancement reveals the superiority of adopting a single APLN 
structure over a cascade one for optimized integration of different QPM device functions using 
the SA method. This also illustrates that it is always desirable to supply as many domain building 
blocks as possible for the SA algorithm to enhance its optimization ability. Take the single APLN 
design as an example, if a smaller unit domain thickness, say, ∆x= 2 µm is instead used, the 
number of the domain building blocks increases by 2.5 times and the calculated SHG conversion 
efficiency is enhanced by a factor of ~1.3 compared to the current design using ∆x= 5 µm based 
on the same EOA field (1027 V/mm). In the SA process all of the unit domain blocks are 
available and can be manipulated to optimize the composing of a single aperiodic-domain 
structure for performing both the two device functions, while, for the same device length, half or 
part of the block numbers are obtained to build a section of a cascade structure for performing a 
specific device function. In Fig. 1(b) we see a narrowed spectral linewidth in the SHG peaks 
achieved with the single APLN device. This can be understood based on the same remark made 
for the analogous effect illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The relevant parameters used in the design to 
achieve these results are wEO= 1, wSHG= 1, βEO= 0.5, and βSHG= 0.2 for the cascade APLN device 
and ws,EO= 0.34, ws,SHG= 0.66, βs,EO= 0.25, and βs,SHG= 0.25 for the single APLN device for all 4 
designated wavelengths. The operating temperature of all the devices is 37oC. 
We next perform proof-of-principle experiments for the two proposed monolithic APLN 
devices. We fabricated the two devices in LiNbO3 based on the calculated cascade and single 
aperiodic QPM-domain structures, both 2 cm in length, 1 mm in width, and 0.5 mm in thickness 
using the standard electric-field poling technique [38]. The domain grating structure of the 
fabricated APLN crystals was revealed by HF etching and inspected by a 500× power microscope, 
showing an average overpoled domain error [12] of ~14% and random domain errors [12] of 
<5%. The cascade one is comprised of a 1-cm-long APLN structure in the front section, which is 
the 4-channel EOA PM converter, followed by another 1-cm-long APLN structure, the 4-channel 
SH generator. The two y faces of the front 1-cm-long section of the cascade APLN crystal and the 
whole length of the single APLN crystal were sputtered with NiCr alloy to form side electrodes. 
The end faces of the two APLN crystals were optically polished without the application of an 
optical coating. These fabricated APLN devices were characterized using an external cavity laser 
(ECL) tunable in the telecom C band followed by an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) as the 
pumping source. An in-line polarizer whose input and output were coupled with polarization 
maintaining (PM) fibers was connected to the EDFA output to decide and fix the polarization 
direction of the pump beam. The pump beam was then collimated and size-reduced to a radius of 
~108 µm in the crystal. The APLN crystal to be measured was installed in a temperature 
controlled oven. A polarizer whose transmission axis was aligned parallel to the APLN y axis to 
transmit TE-polarized waves in the telecom C band was mounted at the output end of the crystal 
as the analyzer. Figures 2(a) and (b) show the measured transmission spectra of the cascade and 
(i.e., cascaded EOA-PM:SHG conversions).

Fig. 4. Measured (solid red circles) and calculated (solid blue line) SH conversion spectra of the cascade 
APLN device. The transmission axis of the in-line polarizer at the input end of the crystal is switched to 
transmit TE waves in the telecom C band and the EOA PM conversion section is activated. The inset 
illustrates such system arrangement. 
conversion efficiencies for the two processes in a given AOS structure; and wEO and wSHG are 
adjustable parameters (between 0 and 1) for giving a weighting to ηEO and ηSHG so as to direct the 
algorithm to best reach the target efficiencies. Specifically, ηEO is equivalent to the transmittance 
of an EO APLN filter and can be found in Ref. [31] and ηSHG is the square of the Fourier 
coefficient obtained from the Fourier analysis of an AOS structure for the SH generation process 
[42] and reaches its maximum value of (2/π)2 when the structure reduces to the periodic QPM 
structure. In the AOS technique using the SA optimization method, a unit domain block of 
thickness ∆x well smaller than the coherence lengths of all the designated nonlinear couplings is 
used as the building block for constructing the optimal QPM domain structure [42]. The 
coherence length for QPM (eee) SH generation of a 1342-nm wave in LiNbO3 is ~6.6 µm (~3.4 
µm for a 1064-nm wave), while it is ~9 µm for the EOA PM conversion [13]. In this study, we 
chose ∆x= 4 µm due to the limit of our current ability for LiNbO3 domain poling. This technical 
limit in crystal poling is also the major reason that we choose the 1342-nm Nd:YVO4 laser line 
rather than the more popular 1064-nm line for the present proof-of-principle demonstration. This 
APLN consists of 5000 unit domain blocks, corresponding to a crystal length of 2 cm. During the 
SA optimization process [42], the domain polarity arrangement of the 5000 blocks is 
systematically varied and each resultant domain sequence is calculated in Eq. (3) to determine an 
optimum domain sequence that results in a minimum OF. 
 A monolithic device cascading a 1-cm long, 13.3-µm period PPLN with a 1-cm long, 
18.1-µm period PPLN is also introduced for purposes of comparison with the present APLN 
design. The former and latter PPLNs work as a 1st-order QPM SHG and a 1st-order QPM EOA 
PMC for 1342 nm at 37oC, respectively. The PPLN EOA PMC has a half-wave field Eπ of 391 
V/mm [13]. For comparison, we let the APLN device be operated at the same half-wave field as 
the PPLN one. This was done by prescribing the ηEO in the OF (see Eq. (3)) so as to satisfy 
ηEO(λi=1342 nm, E= Eπ)= 1. An AOS structure for the APLN device was then generated by the 
developed optimization algorithm with this constrain in the OF. The relevant parameters used in 
the OF were η0= 1+(2/π)2, wEO= 1, and wSHG= 0.8. The optimum efficiency values yielded from 
the algorithm were ηEO(1342 nm, Eπ)~ 1 and ηSHG (1342 nm)~ 0.19. We found the calculated 
AOS structure comprises 3 different domain widths ∆x= 4 µm, 2∆x= 8 µm, and 3∆x= 12 µm. 
~77% of the constituent domains has the width of 8 µm (~16% for the width of 4 µm), which can 
be understood as this domain width is closest to the coherence lengths for a PPLN SHG (~6.6 µm) 
and a PPLN EOA PMC (~9 µm) at 1342 nm. Fig. 5 shows the results of the Fourier analysis of 
the QPM domain structures for the APLN (solid curve) and the cascaded PPLN (dashed curve) 
devices. Two dominant spatial frequencies at ~0.0552 and ~0.0752 µm-1 are resolved from both 
QPM devices. The two frequencies exactly correspond to the reciprocal vectors required for the 
designated QPM EOA PM conversion and SH generation processes in LiNbO3, respectively. We 
clearly see in Fig. 5 that the Fourier coefficient at the ~0.0752 µm-1 frequency analyzed from the 
APLN domain structure is ~1.3 times larger than that obtained from the cascade PPLN structure. 
The Fourier coefficient at the ~0.0552 µm-1 frequency is about the same for both structures. By 
the definition for ηSHG, the peak conversion efficiency of the prescribed SH generation in the 
APLN device can then be ~1.32 (~1.7) times higher than that in the cascade PPLN device. The 
inset in Fig. 5 illustrates this enhancement in peak efficiency of the APLN SHG (solid curve) 
over the PPLN one (dashed curve). When being as an EO Q-switch and intracavity SHG, such an 
(x) faces of this crystal were optically polished and had anti-reflection (AR) coatings for dual 
wavelengths at 1342 and 671 nm. We first characterized the single-pass performance of this 
device in extracavity of a (cw) 1342-nm Nd:YVO4 laser. The APLN device was installed in a 
temperature controlled oven and sandwiched in between a pair of cross polarizers. Fig. 6(a) 
shows the measured (solid circles) and calculated (solid curve) transmittances versus the EOA 
field built across the side electrodes. The results indicate a half-wave field of ~391 V/mm as 
predicted. Fig. 6(b) shows the measured (solid circles) and calculated (solid curve) single-pass 
SHG efficiencies as a function of the crystal temperature without the application of the EOA field. 
The lower measured peak efficiency (~8% lower) than predicted could be attributable to the 
domain-width error originating during the crystal poling process. We estimated an average 
overpoled domain error of 12% and random domain errors of <5% [21] from the fabricated 
APLN domain grating structure.

Fig. 7 shows the schematic of the EO Q-switched ISHG constructed using the fabricated 
APLN device in a diode-pumped Nd:YVO4 laser. The laser gain medium, pumped by a 
fiber-coupled 809-nm diode laser, is a 9-mm-long a-cut Nd:YVO4 crystal with 0.3-at. % Nd3+ 
doping. The 1342-nm laser oscillates in a linear cavity formed by two high-reflection mirrors, 
designated M1 and M2. M1 is a 15-cm radius-of-curvature meniscus dielectric mirror having 
>99.8% reflectance at 1342 nm and ~95% transmittance at 809 nm. The output coupler M2 is a 
plane-plane dielectric mirror having ~99.5% reflectance at 1342 nm and ~93% transmittance at 
671 nm. The cavity length of this laser system was ~5.8 cm. During operation, we drove the 
APLN device with a ~300-ns-voltage-pulse train at a 5-kHz pulse rate. We found the optimum 
Q-switch voltage for this laser to be ~200 V, which is approximately the characterized 
quarter-wave voltage [13] of this device. Efficient Q-switched operation of this laser is 
accomplished via the intracavity SH generation in the same APLN device leading to fast 
depletion of the accumulated fundamental energy during the Q-switch open state. Fig. 8(a) shows 
a typical 671-nm SH laser pulse measured from the system at 5.2-W diode pump power; a pulse 
width of as narrow as ~8 ns was obtained. The inset shows the corresponding depleted 1342-nm 
fundamental laser pulse acquired with an InGaAs photodetector, suggesting ~51% of the 
fundamental pulse energy was converted to the SH wave, as estimated from the fitted Gaussian 
pulse (gray line). Fig. 8(b) shows the measured pulse width (solid circles) and peak power (open 
conversion, respectively. The results indicate that such a temperature gradient in the crystal has a 
minor effect on the performance of the present APLN devices, which is consistent with the 
observations made in Ref. [31] for a relatively short device. In addition, one can observe from Fig. 
9(b) that the peak values of the output SHG spectra become rippled due to errors. These 
simulation results can be readily understood by looking at the characteristic efficiencies of QPM 
EOA and SHG devices. To illustrate this, we simplify the expressions of the conversion 
efficiencies of a PPLN EOA PM converter [7] and a PPLN SH generator [37] to some 
proportional normalized-forms as

respectively, where F(D)≡sin(πD) originates in the first-order Fourier coefficient of the periodic 
domain structure with domain duty cycle D; L is the device length; and ∆βEO and ∆βSHG are the 
wave-vector mismatches of the two nonlinear coupling processes. The domain engineering error 
introduced during the lithographic poling process actually results in the form of an asymmetric 
domain duty cycle rather than the alteration of the domain period [12]. In this case, the peak 
efficiencies of the two QPM devices occur at ∆βEO and ∆βSHG= 0, corresponding to 
)2/)sin((sin 2, DpeakEOPPLN ππη ∝  and )(sin 2, DpeakSHGPPLN πη ∝ . For an asymmetric duty-cycle 
value (i.e., 0<D<0.5), ηPPLN SHG, peak is always smaller than ηPPLN EO, peak. For example, for a 20% 
domain-width error, D= 0.4/0.6, leading to ηPPLN EO, peak~ 0.994 and ηPPLN SHG, peak~ 0.90, which is 
similar to the descent ratios for the peak efficiencies of the APLN EOA-filter and SHG devices 
presented in Figs. 9(a) and (b) due to the domain-width error. If temperature error exists, the 
and frequency doubler integrated in a monolithic APLN crystal and an EO Q-switch and 
intracavity frequency doubler integrated in a single-grating-structure APLN crystal. Several key 
techniques have also been developed for realizing these devices in this project, including a 
computer design algorithm for calculating an APLN domain structure optimized for 
simultaneously being a multi-wavelength filter and a SHG, a computer design algorithm for 
calculating an APLN domain structure optimized for simultaneously being a laser Q-switch and a 
SHG, and the Q-switched intracavity SHG system design and construction. 
It is possible to implement the present APLN devices in LiNbO3 waveguides supporting both 
TE and TM modes. Take a Ti:LiNbO3 waveguide as an example. The required EOA field can be 
reduced by a factor of >50, due to the possibility of reducing the electrode separation to the order 
of the waveguide width [7]. The SHG peak conversion efficiency can be increased by a factor of 
>100 due to an increase in the pump intensity resulting from the highly reduced mode size in the 
waveguide [43]. Prospectively, it is interesting to construct an electro-optic internally Q-switched 
intracavity SHG Er:Ti:APLN waveguide laser by using a single-grating-structure APLN crystal 
optimized for simultaneously performing a laser Q-switch and a second-harmonic generator. Such 
a novel integrated device will be the first design of a single QPM crystal monolithically 
integrating multiple optical device functions including the waveguiding, laser, Q-switching, and 
SHG.
