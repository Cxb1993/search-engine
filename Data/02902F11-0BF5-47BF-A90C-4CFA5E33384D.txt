21. Introduction
The disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been increasingly shifted to
incineration in the last twenty years. However, HCl, a corrosive gas, can be formed
when the feeding materials containing chloride compounds such as polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) are combusted. In particular, HCl will lead to the formation of dioxins which is
an even more hazardous carcinogen. Therefore, HCl emission is regulated tightly by
environmental laws.
In order to reduce the HCl emission, many researchers investigated the reaction of
CaO with HCl at low temperatures.1-5 Because of the low conversion efficiency and
no suppression of the formation of dioxins at low temperatures, studies of HCl
absorption by Ca-based sorbents at high temperatures have been paid more attention
by some investigators.6-9 High sorbent conversion efficiency and the suppression of
the downstream formation of hazardous byproducts for sorbents in-furnace injection
have attracted more attention. The reaction of Ca-based sorbents with HCl is affected
by some factors, e.g., the reaction temperature, sorbent properties and reaction
atmosphere. In general, reaction temperature is considered a significant factor in
particular at higher temperatures. When the reaction temperature exceeds the melting
point, 772 °C, the melten phase of CaCl2 can lead to a poor performance of HCl
retention. The optimum reaction temperature of CaO with HCl is generally at
600 °C10,11 or 650 °C12. The discrepancy of temperature may be attributed to reaction
atmosphere which leads to competitive reaction or reverse reaction. However, the
good capacity of binding HCl by Ca-based sorbents in-furnace injection may not be
4fixed-bed consists of a 29 mm ID by 460 mm-height quartz tube equipped with a
porous quartz distributor 105 mm above the bottom and an electric heater which can
be operated between 500 °C and 850 °C. A thermocouple inserted into the sorbent bed
was used to measure the bed temperature.
2.2. Materials. Quartz sand with an average particle size of 600 m and a mean
density of 2500 kg/m3 was used as the bed material. CaO of three particle sizes of 163,
385 and 545 m and CaCO3 of a 545 m mean particle size were used as the sorbents.
CaCO3 was sieved to a mean particle size by an electric sieve shaker. CaO was
obtained by CaCO3 calcined at a high temperature (800 °C) for 2 hours until CaCO3
was fully calcined to become CaO. The Spectrochemical analysis of CaCO3 is
tabulated in Table 1.
2.3. Procedure. 20 g quartz sand and 0.5 g CaCO3 were fully mixed and put into a
fixed-bed reactor at 800 °C for 2 hours. N2 gas was first introduced into the reactor at
a flow rate of 0.4 L/min STP in order to sweep out carbon dioxide decomposed from
CaCO3 during the calcination of CaCO3 before the HCl removal process. The feeding
gas is constituted of a mixture of dry HCl with N2 gas. A gas flow rate of 1.6 L/min
STP was regulated by a rotameter. The reaction gas, HCl at a concentration of 1000
ppm in dry N2 gas, was fed into the preheater. Then the preheated gas mixture of
400 °C was introduced into the reactor under five operating temperatures of 600, 650,
700, 750 and 800 °C, respectively. The gas output from the fixed-bed reactor was first
pumped into a cooler, and then the HCl concentration was measured online by an
ETG IMA 3000B gas analyzer. At the end, HCl gas was absorbed by a solution of
6control. Thus we can obtain the equation of conversion time as follows:

2 represents the ratio of the capacities of the shrinking core system for chemical
reaction and for diffusion. Szekely et al.13 considered the reaction is controlled by
chemical reaction when 2 is smaller than 0.1. On the other hand, the reaction is
controlled by the diffusion through the product layer when 2 is larger than 10.
When the value of 2 falls in the range 0.1–10 it suggests that the reaction is
controlled by the combination of both chemical reaction and product layer diffusion.
The least-square method is usually used to determine g and 2 from
experimental data as follows:

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Reaction kinetics. The reaction mechanism of CaO with HCl can be
characterized with an unreacted shrinking core model which assumes CaO to be
nonporous particles. Figure 2 shows CaO conversion rate with reaction time at 600 °C.
It was found that the combined control model of chemical reaction and product layer
diffusion is in satisfactory agreement with experimental data. The discrepancy
between chemical reaction control model and experimental data become more
obvious with the increasing particle sizes. Also it shows that in early reaction stage
the reaction of CaO with HCl is controlled by chemical reaction mechanism and then
8particle size. Meanwhile, the total reaction time, i.e. the time of both chemical
reaction and product layer diffusion control, also increases with the particle size. In
summary, reaction time share represents the sorbent CaO’s capacity in absorbing HCl.
Figure 4 shows the effect of the reaction temperature (650–800 °C) on the chemical
reaction rate constant. It was found that the reaction rate constant increases with the
reaction temperature for sorbent CaO of 163 m and a reverse trend is true for sorbent
CaO of 545 m. This result can be explained as follows: the overall reaction rate is
limited by the chemical reaction rate when the reaction of CaO with HCl is controlled
by chemical reaction mechanism. In this case, the reaction rate increases with the
reaction temperature for small particle size (163 m). However, the product layer of
CaCl2 is thick for large particle size (545 m). Only when HCl gas diffuses through
the product layer and arrives at the fresh CaO front, the reaction of CaO with HCl can
proceed. Diffusion through the product layer limits the overall reaction rate. The
rising temperature results in the melten product layer of CaCl2 and this again
increases the diffusion resistance to HCl gas. Therefore, the reaction rate decreases
with increasing reaction temperature for large particle size (545 m).
However, the previous study reported that an increase of the temperature leads to a
decrease of the reaction rate constant (163 and 465 m).16 This result can be attributed
to quartz sand as the bed material in this study and only sorbent CaO was used in the
fixed-bed reactor of the previous study. The reaction of CaO with HCl can be
regarded as a plug flow reaction with only sorbent in the fixed-bed reactor. Therefore,
HCl gas at first reacts with CaO grains at the surface of the bed, and then moves into
10
formation rate in solid phase.
3.3 CaCO3 conversion. Ca-based sorbent, e.g. CaCO3 is in general injected in
combustors to absorb HCl because of its low capital cost and simple implementation.
In this study the reaction of CaCO3 with HCl was investigated in a fixed-bed reactor.
0.5 g CaCO3 was mixed with 20 g quartz sand. Pure CO2 gas was input into the
fixed-bed reactor as the protective gas to prevent decomposition of CaCO3 during
heating by an electric heater. When the temperature of the bed arrives at a certain
reaction temperature (e.g. 600 °C) N2 is first introduced into the fixed-bed reactor to
push out CO2 gas. Then HCl gas is pumped into the fixed-bed reactor to react with
sorbent CaCO3. Figure 5 shows that CaCO3 conversion with an average particle size
of 545 m varies with reaction temperature. It was found that CaCO3 conversion is
the highest at 700 °C. A decrease in CaCO3 conversion was observed as the reaction
temperature is higher than 700 °C. Compared to the reaction of CaO with HCl,
CaCO3 conversion is low. This can be attributed to the fact that large BET surface of
sorbent CaO. Thus CaO is more porous than CaCO3. On the other hand, the reaction
of CaCO3 with HCl can be formulated as follows:
3 2 2 2CaCO +2HCl CaCl +H O+CO (8)
2 2CaO+2HCl CaCl +H O (9)
The conversion rate of CaCO3 increases with the temperature in the 600–700 °C
range although it is low. Also this can improve the porosity of CaCO3 and the reaction
of CaO with HCl. Therefore, CaCO3 conversion increases with the temperature
(600–700 °C). As we know, the melting point of CaCl2 is 772°C. When there is
12
combination of chemical reaction and product layer diffusion control as sorbent
particle size increases.
(2) In this study, sorbent grains scatter evenly in bed material to prevent
agglomeration. Thus for small particles (163 m), the overall reaction rate is
controlled by chemical reaction and the reaction rate constant increases with the
reaction temperature.
(3) CaCO3 conversion arrives at its maximum at 700 °C. This cause can be regarded
as decomposition of CaCO3 at high temperature. But as the reaction temperature
approaches the melting point of CaCl2, the formation of the melten product layer
obstructs sorbent from absorbing HCl.
(4) HCl gas residence time in the fixed-bed reactor and sorbent grains scattering
uniformity in bed material increase with the bed height leads to an increase in CaO
conversion.
