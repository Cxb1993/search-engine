2devices, are frequently to obtain various sorts of
useful data from surroundings. These devices
sense physical properties, such as sound,
humidity, pressure, luminosity, temperature, or
chemical concentration, and transmit the
gathered data to a base station (BS) for further
analysis and processing. WSNs have been
effectively deployed in tactical combat
situations, habitat monitoring, home security,
and so on [7-9]. Since WSNs consist of many
sensors with limited energy, an energy-efficient
network protocol is an important consideration
in WSN applications. Many routing protocols
for WSNs have appeared in the literature. In
applications using direct transmission (DT)
protocols [10], sensor nodes transmit their
sensed data directly to a BS. Thus, the nodes
located far from the BS will die quickly since
they dissipate much energy in transmitting data
packets. DT protocols are inefficient since
energy levels of nodes are drained rapidly when
the BS is located far. On the other hand,
minimum transmission energy (MTE) protocols
[11] transmit data packets to the BS by way of
multi-hop relay. As a result, nodes located near
the BS die quickly since they end up relaying
lots of data on behalf of remote nodes. The
results of simulations using the DT and MTE
communication protocols are shown in Figs.
2(a)-(d), with the BS located at the point with
coordinates (50, 200). Clearly, DT and MTE
result in a poor distribution for energy
consumption by nodes. Sensor nodes in some
subregions have all died out, but nodes in other
regions are still active. As a result, data for a
part of the sensor field may not be detected.

Clustering communication protocols represent
a superior approach, and result in more balanced
patterns of energy use in WSNs [12]. The first
low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy was
LEACH, proposed by Heinzelman et al. [13,
14]. It showed how energy loads could be well
amortized by dynamically creating a small
number of clusters based on a threshold function
T(s) with a priori probability p (say, 5%), in a
set-up phase. The technique uses cluster heads
(CHs) to mediate data transmission. Simulation
results in [13, 14] show that all node tend to
dissipate the same level of energy over time
since the CH roles are rotated among nodes.
Although LEACH clearly outperforms the DT
and MTE protocols, it retains several
shortcomings. Thus several enhanced versions
of LEACH have appeared in the literature [15].
LEACH uses a threshold function parametrized
by a probability p input by user. However, the
performance of sensor network is very sensitive
to the value of p. When p is large, many clusters
are formed and could result in high energy
consumption since many CHs dissipate energy
in transmitting to the BS. On the other hand,
when p is small, only a few clusters are formed,
which may increase energy dissipation when
member nodes transmit to CHs. The literature
suggests that the optimal p value popt, or the
optimal cluster number kopt, depends on
4individuals that dominate the individual (np), is
applied to reduce the computational complexity.
A child population Qt of size N at generation t=0
is then created using binary tournament
selection (in Section D), extended intermediate
crossover (in Section E) and non-uniform
mutation (in Section F) operators. Thereafter,
the following procedure is applied in each
generation. First, the parent and child
populations are combined to form a pool
population Rt of size 2N, which is sorted by the
fast non-domination sorting approach.
Meanwhile, the parent solutions are compared
with the child population to ensure elitist
strategy. The new parent population is created
by adding solutions from the first front and
continuing to other fronts successively until the
population size exceeds N (Fig. 5). The new
parent population with size N is now can be
created by computing crowding distance of each
individual and using a crowded-comparison
operator described in Section D.
Figure 5. Flowchart of the enhanced MOGA.
Figure 5. The procedure of generating
individuals with size N via non-dominated
sorting and crowded-distance sorting.
2.4 Crowded-comparison Operator and
Binary Tournament Selection Operator
Once the non-dominated sorting is complete
the crowding distance is assigned. The crowding
distance for each individual, idistance, is computed
from the summation of the Euclidean distance
between neighbors (i-1) and (i+1) based on
sorted fitness values of each objective function
[18]. Thereafter, the crowded-comparison
operator, n , is employed to ensure the
diversity of the last accepted front. The
definition i n j means (irank<jrank) or ((irank=jrank)
& (idistance>jdistance)). Namely, the selection is
biased towards selecting the solution with the
lower rank or larger crowding distance when
both points i and j are located on the same front.
Consequently, the binary tournament selection
operator selects two individuals and selects the
best one as the new individual via the crowded-
comparison operator. This process is repeated
population size of times. Thus, this selection
procedure builds the population Pt+1 with size N
as shown in Fig. 5.

where G is the set of nodes that have not been
CHs in the last 1/p rounds.
Figure 7. The LEACH clustering
communication hierarchy for WSNs.
When a node decides to be a CH, it
broadcasts an advertisement message, with the
node’s ID and a header, using a non-persistent
carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) MAC
protocol to ensure the elimination of collisions,
to the entire sensor field. The size of the
message is small, so that it can be efficiently
broadcasted to reach all of the nodes in the
network. Non-CH nodes (or member nodes)
decide to join the cluster defined by the CH with
the strongest received signal. Next, each non-
CH sends a join-request containing their ID, to
the closest CH using CSMA.
After the cluster-setup sub-phase, the CH
recognizes the number of member nodes and
IDs of the nodes. Based on all join-request
messages received within the cluster, the CH
creates a TDMA schedule in addition to a unique
spreading code, and transmits them to cluster
members at the beginning of steady-state phase.
Thereafter, all nodes in the cluster transmit their
data packets to their CHs in the pre-specified
TDMA time slot, using this code. As we known
that TDMA-based protocols are naturally energy
preserving, because they have time slots built-in,
and do not suffer from collisions. Also, each
member node can situate in a sleep mode at all
times except during its corresponding time slots
in order to decrease node’s energy dissipation. 
When the data packets sent by a node have been
received by a CH, the CH aggregates and
forwards them to the BS. These actions are
repeated in each round. It is clearly shown that
the nodes dead obtained using LEACH are more
uniform than that of DT and MTE protocols.
The plots of simulation results by LEACH are
shown in Figs. 8(a) and (b), for the BS located at
coordinate (50, 200). It is clearly shown that the
nodes dead obtained using LEACH are more
uniform than that of DT and MTE protocols.

3.2 Our Proposed Genetic Algorithm-based
Adaptive Clustering Protocol
Our work introduces a genetic algorithm-
based variant of LEACH to determine the
optimal value of p for various base station
placements. The GA-based optimization
procedure is performed only once, before the
set-up phase of the first round. The pseudo-code
of the proposed protocol is described as follows.

5.1 One-hop Relay/Multi-hop Relay
Communication Model
To handle mobile base station placement
problems, the representation of an individual in
the enhanced MOGA is denoted as a vector
(c1,…, cn, b1,…, bn) where ci=(xi, yi) denotes the
i-th base station position; bi=0 or 1 is the active
Boolean logic value of the i-th base station to
enable or disable the base station. The fitness
functions are specified as the total number of
sensors/transmitters (f1) and total coverage (f2).

Table III lists the Pareto optimal front
solutions of cost versus average coverage,
maximum coverage, minimum coverage and
standard deviation obtained using the enhanced
MOGA and NSGA-II after 20 trials. The
maximum coverage reached 100% when the
number of base stations was greater than 7.
Also, the results show that the optimal cost for
covering the hexagons was 7 units. From the
comparison, the Pareto-optimal fronts obtained
using the enhanced MOGA and NSGA-II were
very similar. Namely, the optimal results
obtained by the proposed enhanced MOGA are
as good as those obtained by the NSGA-II.

5.1.2 Scenario 1: Monitor an Area
Figure 13. Scenario of monitoring an area by the
WSN.
Figure 13 displays the scenario that an area,
such as forest in the hostile region, is monitored
by the WSN. Sensors are distributed uniformly
to cover the region. Sensors are capable of
communicating with each other to transmit in-
formation to HECN and the HECN is able to
provide the transmission relay to a UAV. To
simulate this scenario, this work simplifies the
monitored area as an elliptic domain within a 10
m 10 m domain. The lengths of semi-major
axis and semi-minor axis were 4.0 m and 3.0 m,
respectively. The HECN is located at the coor-
dinate point (5.0, 5.0). Also, the maximum
number of sensors and ratio of sensing and
communication radiuses were 20 m and 1.4/3.0,
respectively. Two objective functions are ap-
plied to minimize the number of sensors and to
maximize the coverage. There are twenty re-
peated runs are implemented for the simulation.
The objective functions are set to minimize the
number of sensors and also maximize the cover-
age of the monitoring area. The expression of
the two objective functions is expressed as

5.1.3 Scenario 2: Monitor a Hostile Facility
Figure 16 displays the scenario that a hostile
facility is monitored by the WSN. Sensors are
distributed around outside the facility to detect
the movements in and out the facility. Sensors
are also capable of communicating with each
other to transmit gathered information to the
HECN which is able to provide the transmission
relay to a UAV. To simulate this scenario, this
study uses the entire interesting region as a 10m
10 m square domain. The position of HECN is
located at the point (5.0, 5.0). Also, the
maximum number of sensors and ratio of
sensing and communication radiuses were 20
and 1.4/3.0, respectively.
Fig. 16. Scenario of monitoring a hostile facility
by the WSN.
In this scenario, two geometries of monitored
facility are studied. The one is a circular facility
and another is a hexagon one. Two objective
functions are implemented using the enhanced
MOGA. The first objective function is to mini-
mize the number of sensors, and the second one
is to maximize the coverage. Lines are gener-
ated around the circle or hexagon. Thus, the ex-
pression of the two objective functions is ex-
pressed as follows.

1) Circular Facility Monitoring: In the first
case of monitoring the hostile facility, the
geometry of facility is simplified to a circle. The
sensors should be placed outside the circular
perimeter and can be communicated with each
other. Figure 17 depicts the Pareto-optimal front
with average coverage 99.28% when using 11
sensors to monitor the perimeter. Figure 18
displays the best distributions of sensing and
communication with 10 sensors. The
communication between each sensor is
complete. Also, the sensor nearby HECN is
linkable to transmit the gathered sensing data of
sensors to the HECN in order to perform the
transmission relay to a UAV. Table V lists the
detailed results of number of sensors versus
coverage after 20 repeated runs.

5.2 Low Energy Dissipation Communication
Model
Our work assumes that all sensor nodes are
homogeneous and distributed uniformly over the
sensor field with limited energy that the links
between nodes are symmetric, and that messages
from all nodes can reach the BS. The nodes are
distributed randomly in a square of size MM.
Each simulation is repeated for 30 independent
runs. In addition, control packet sizes for
broadcasting packet and packet header were 50
bits long, and the energy dissipation for
aggregating data was 5 and 10 nJ/bit/signal.
5.2.1 Comparison of Optimal Probability of
Cluster Heads
In this section, the energy dissipation for ag-
gregating data and the parameter fs were speci-
fied as 5 nJ/bit/signal and 10 pJ/bit/m2, respec-
tively. The total number of sensor nodes was
100. Figures 21(a) and (b) show the comparison
of optimal probability obtained from model
analysis and GA-based computation for a vari-
ety of locations of BS for the sensor fields of
50m50m and 100m100m. The comparison of
solutions depicts that the distribution of present
popt quite agreed with the corrected form using
our analytical formulas of (16), whereas
Heinzelman et al.’s results displayed a large dis-
crepancy when compared to the data by using
the GA and present modified analytical formulas.
Moreover, the results show that the optimal
probability, popt, is clearly affected by the loca-
tions of BS. When the BS is located near the
sensor field, the values of popt are large. On the
contrary, the values of optimal probability de-
crease as the BS moves farther from the sensor
field. When the BS located at the center of sen-
sor field, the values of ][ 2toBSdE is given by [24,

and the form of popt can be simplified as

Equation (24) states that the parameter popt is
just function of the total number of sensor nodes
only when the BS located at the center of sensor
field. Namely, the value of probability at the
center of sensor field is independent of the do-
main size.

Moreover, the values of popt are clearly de-
pendent of the total number of sensor nodes (n)
16
Table VII lists the simulation results obtained
using LEACH and presented LEACH-GA
protocols for BS located at different positions.
The initial energy for all nodes was 0.5(J) and
the probability p used in LEACH is 5%, same as
the settings in [10, 11]. The number of rounds
required when the number dead of nodes is 1%,
20%, 50%, and 100% are recorded during
simulations. From our results, the values of popt
clearly depend on the positions of BS. The value
of optimal probability is the largest when the BS
is at the center of sensor field, and it decreases
when the BS moves outward. Moreover, the
proposed LEACH-GA outperforms LEACH in
terms of lifetime of network.

Figures 25(a) and (b) compare the
performance of four protocols with the BS
located at two coordinates of (25, 250) and (25,
350), respectively. Our protocol clearly has
excellent performance as compared with other
protocols. When the location of BS is far from
the sensor field, presented protocol prolongs the
lifetime of network significantly since it uses an
optimal probability in forming clusters. The
gains achieved are as high as 54% and 110%,
compared to LEACH with the BS located at (25,

hierarchy was LEACH, proposed by Heinzelman et al. [7, 8].
It showed how energy loads could be well amortized by
dynamically creating a small number of clusters based on a
threshold function T(s) with a priori probability p (say, 5%),
in a set-up phase. The technique uses cluster heads (CHs) to
mediate data transmission. Simulation results in [7, 8] show
that all node tend to dissipate the same level of energy over
time since the CH roles are rotated among nodes. Although
LEACH clearly outperforms the DT and MTE protocols, it
retains several shortcomings. Thus several enhanced versions
of LEACH have appeared in the literature [9]. LEACH uses
a threshold function parametrized by a probability p input by
user. However, the performance of sensor network is very
sensitive to the value of p. When p is large, many clusters are
formed and could result in high energy consumption since
many CHs dissipate energy in transmitting to the BS. On the
other hand, when p is small, only a few clusters are formed,
which may increase energy dissipation when member nodes
transmit to CHs. The literature suggests that the optimal p
value popt, or the optimal cluster number kopt, depends on
parameters such as the total number of nodes distributed in
the sensor field, the size of sensor field, the location of BS,
and so on [10, 11]. Our work proposes a genetic algorithm-
based (GA-based) adaptive clustering protocol, termed
LEACH-GA, to predict the optimal values of probability
effectively.
II. ENERGY-EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS
We now briefly describe the LEACH protocol, and then
present our genetic algorithm-based adaptive clustering
protocol.
A. Clustering Hierarchy in LEACH
LEACH operates in several rounds, each consisting of a
set-up and a steady-state phase. Each node transmits sensed
data to its closest CH. The CH for each cluster receives and
aggregates the data from cluster members and then transmits
the aggregated data to the BS through a single-hop relay
(shown in Fig. 2). LEACH creates a set-up phase for CHs’
selection, and a steady-state phase for time slot scheduling
and transmission. Each sensor node s decides independently
of other senor nodes whether it will claim to be a CH or not,
by picking a random r between 0 and 1 and comparing r with
a threshold T(s) based on a user-specified probability p. The
threshold is defined as follows [7]:

where G is the set of nodes that have not been CHs in the last
1/p rounds. When a node decides to be a CH, it broadcasts an
advertisement message, with the node’s ID and a header, 
using a non-persistent carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA)
MAC protocol to ensure the elimination of collisions, to the
entire sensor field. The size of the message is small, so that it
can be efficiently broadcasted to reach all of the nodes in the
network. Non-CH nodes (or member nodes) decide to join
the cluster defined by the CH with the strongest received
signal. Next, each non-CH sends a join-request containing
their ID, to the closest CH using CSMA.
Figure 2. The LEACH clustering communication hierarchy for WSNs.
After the cluster-setup sub-phase, the CH recognizes the
number of member nodes and IDs of the nodes. Based on all
join-request messages received within the cluster, the CH
creates a TDMA schedule in addition to a unique spreading
code, and transmits them to cluster members at the beginning
of steady-state phase. Thereafter, all nodes in the cluster
transmit their data packets to their CHs in the pre-specified
TDMA time slot, using this code. As we known that TDMA-
based protocols are naturally energy preserving, because they
have time slots built-in, and do not suffer from collisions.
Also, each member node can situate in a sleep mode at all
times except during its corresponding time slots in order to
decrease node’s energy dissipation. When the data packets
sent by a node have been received by a CH, the CH
aggregates and forwards them to the BS. These actions are
repeated in each round. The plots of simulation results by
LEACH are shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b), for the BS located
at coordinate (50, 200). It is clearly shown that the nodes
dead obtained using LEACH are more uniform than that of
DT and MTE protocols.

B. Our Proposed Genetic Algorithm-based Adaptive
Clustering Protocol
Our work introduces a genetic algorithm-based variant of
LEACH to determine the optimal value of p for various base
station placements. The GA-based optimization procedure is
performed only once, before the set-up phase of the first

Heinzelman et al. [8] assumed the BS is far from the nodes,
so the energy dissipation follows the multipath model. Thus,
their formula for kopt is only the lower part of (10). The

In this work, (10) is used as a corrected form of analytical
solution for kopt without assuming the positions of BS located
near or far from the sensor field.
IV. GENETIC ALGORITHM-BASED CLUSTERING
At the beginning of preparation phase, each node initially
determines whether or not it should be a candidate cluster
head (CCH), using the following cluster head selection
procedure. First, every sensor node selects a random number
r from the interval [0, 1]. If r is smaller than T(s), based on a
prescribed probability pset, then the node is a CCH. The value
of pset can be a large value in our protocol, pset=0.5, say.
Thereafter, each node sends its ID, location information, and
whether or not it is a CCH to the BS. As the BS receives
messages sent by all nodes, it performs GA operations to
determine the optimal probability, popt= kopt/n, by minimizing
the total amount of energy consumption in each round.
Therefore, the objective function used in the GA can be
formulated as

The values of xc are one for
our binary-GA when it is a CCH, otherwise, it is zero. The
parameters =fs and =2 were used for d<d0; while, =mp
and =4 were set for dd0. The symbol q represents the
number of member nodes in a CCH. The optimal probability
popt is determined by the GA by searching the solution space
through an evolutionary optimization process incorporating
probabilistic transitions and non-deterministic rules, and
applying selection, crossover and mutation operators. Once
the optimal probability popt is found, the BS broadcasts the
value of popt to all nodes. The set-up and steady-state phases
begin. The procedures of set-up and steady-state phase are
the same as in LEACH.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
Our work assumes that all sensor nodes are homogeneous
and distributed uniformly over the sensor field with limited
energy, that the links between nodes are symmetric, and that
messages from all nodes can reach the BS. The nodes are
distributed randomly in a square of size 50m50m. Each
simulation is repeated for 30 independent runs, and the
results of these runs are averaged. In addition, control packet
sizes for broadcasting packet and packet header were 50 bits
long, and the energy dissipation for aggregating data was 10
nJ/bit/signal. The comparison of optimal probability obtained
from model analysis and GA-based computation for a variety
of locations of BS is depicted in Fig. 5. The results show that
the optimal probability, popt, is clearly affected by the
locations of BS. When the BS is located near the sensor field,
the values of popt are large. On the contrary, the values of
optimal probability decrease as the BS moves farther from
the sensor field.

and genetic algorithm optimzation..
