Abstract
During the past few years the widespread use of the wireless local area networks (WLANs)
communication technique is one of the most popular technologies in data telecommunications
and networking. With the increasing variety of multimedia applications, such as voice, video and
web traffic, it is needed to develop a mechanism for the quality of service (QoS) to support
different types of traffic.
The IEEE 802.11 protocol has achieved worldwide acceptance with WLANs with minimum
management and maintenance costs. However, IEEE 802.11 can only provide a best effort
service and does not support the quality of services (QoS). Furthermore, the performance of the
Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) degrades significantly under heavy load due to the
increasing time wasted during collision.
To make a more accurate analysis on system performance, in this report we first analyze the
system performance in according to the model used in preview year by taking into consideration
the condition of channel error. In order to increase the system throughput, we further study the
transmission opportunity (TXOP) and Block ACK (B_ACK) mechanisms that are defined in
IEEE 802.11e. The TXOP is the time period when a particular station (STA) has the right to
initiate transmission. During the TXOP, STA is allowed to transmit multiple frames with a short
inter-frame (SIFS) time gap between an ACK and the subsequent frame transmission. In B_ACK,
a block of frames is allowed to be transmitted without being acknowledged. After the

幾年來無線通訊技術是最盛行且廣泛使用的技術之一。隨著多媒體的多樣化，像語音、
影像和網路流量的增加，發展服務品質來支援各種不同的資料型態是必須的。
IEEE 802.11 賦予了安裝快速且管理和維護費用低的優點。然而 IEEE 802.11 只能提供
盡全力型服務且無法支援服務品質，而且分散式協調功能在高負載時將會因碰撞增多而造
成效能上明顯地降低。
為了考慮系統效能上更正確的分析，在這篇報告裡，我們首先將通道錯誤的條件納入
考量，仿照第一年的分析模式進行效能分析。此外為了增加系統的傳輸量，我們也加入 IEEE
802.11e 中的傳送機會(TXOP)和區塊回覆(Block ACK)機制於我們的模組中。傳送機會是在
特殊的行動裝置有開始傳送權限時的一段時間間隔。在傳送機會區間裡，行動裝置被允許
傳送由 SIFS 所區隔的多個訊框。在區塊回覆裡，訊框區塊被允許傳送而不需馬上回應。在
完成傳送區塊後，傳送端行動裝置發出初始區塊回覆要求的訊框，詢問接收端已成功接收
的訊框數目。接收端裝置會發送區塊回覆訊框告知傳送端那些訊框是傳送失敗的。最後我
們分別將 TXOP 與 Block ACK 機制加入於我們的模組中，推導其效能之數學分析並完成數
學分析之模擬。

Introduction
1.1 Background
In recent years, the wireless local area networks (WLANs) market is experiencing an
explosive growth. The medium access control (MAC) protocol is the key element that provides
the efficiency in accessing the channel, while satisfying the QoS requirements.
IEEE 802.11 has emerged as a leading technology for the wireless networks. Today, the IEEE
802.11 can be considered as a wireless version of Ethernet that supports a best effort service. The
IEEE 802.11 distributed WLAN has become widely deployed since the contention-based MAC
protocol is simple, robust, and allows fast installation with minimal management and
maintenance costs. IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol incorporates two medium access methods, the
distributed coordination function (DCF) and the point coordination function (PCF). The IEEE
802.11 MAC protocol is unsuitable for multimedia services with QoS requirements as there is an
increasing use of wireless networks by users and applications with different requirements [1].
IEEE 802.11 EDCF is a new wireless technology which is an enhanced version of IEEE
802.11 DCF. It defines a new supplement to the existing IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. The IEEE
802.11 EDCF aims at improving the capabilities and efficiency of the IEEE 802.11 MAC
protocol by defining a new mechanism to support the QoS services.

sensed as being idle again for more than a DIFS. The station transmits its frame when the backoff
counter reaches zero. At each transmission, the backoff time is uniformly chosen in the range [0,
W−1], where W is the current backoff window size. W equals the initial backoff window size
CWmin. After each unsuccessful transmission, W is doubled until a maximum backoff window
size value CWmax is reached. Once it reaches CWmax, W shall remain at the value CWmax until it is
reset. W shall be reset to CWmin after every successful transmission or the retransmission counter
reaches the retry limit (L). After the destination station successfully receives the frame, it
transmits an acknowledgment frame (ACK) following a short inter-frame space (SIFS) time. If
the transmitting station does not receive the ACK within a specified ACK timeout or it detects the
transmission of a different frame on the channel, it reschedules the frame transmission according
to the previous backoff rules. The above mechanism is called the basic access mechanism (ACK
CSMA/CA) as shown in Figure 1.1. To reduce the hidden station problem, an optional four-way
handshakes data transmission mechanism called request-to-send (RTS)/clear-to-send (CTS) as
shown in Figure 1.2, is also defined in the DCF. Before transmitting a packet, a station operating
in a RTS/CTS mode “reserves”the channel by sending a special Request-To-Send short frame.
The destination station acknowledges the receipt of a RTS frame by sending back a
Clear-To-Send frame. Since collision may occur only on the RTS frame, and it is detected by the
lack of a CTS response, the RTS/CTS mechanism allows for an increase in the system
performance by reducing the duration of a collision when long messages are transmitted [1-3].
1.3. IEEE 802.11e EDCF Scheme
In order to support multiple services in wireless LANs, we must develop a suitable
14
m
max min[AC] = 2 * ( [AC] ),CW CW (1-3)
where m is called the maximum backoff stage. Once it reaches CWmax[AC], it remains at this
value until it is reset.
The remainder of this report is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, we modified the model
used in [4] and analyzed the saturation throughput and saturation delay. We also extended the
model in EDCF and described the modified model in an error channel scenario. In addition,
theoretical analysis of a modified model and numerical simulation results will be given in this
Chapter. In Chapter 3, we integrated the TXOP and Block ACK mechanisms with a modified
model in an error channel condition, respectively. These mechanisms not only support the
concept of differentiating ACs with different priorities but also improve the system performance.
Finally, Chapter 4 gives the conclusions and future researches of this dissertation.

2.1 The Markov Chain Model within Channel Error Environments
In this section we use the same set of assumptions as in the previous descriptions for our
studies. We will consider both the retry limit and channel errors. The proposed Markov chain
model is shown in Fig. 2.1. The contention window size at the backoff stage j in the priority i
class is defined as ,i jW . For convenience, , .02
j
i j iW W , where  0,j m is called the backoff
stage, ,0iW is the initial contention window size in the priority i class, and m is the maximum
backoff stage. For each STA, the backoff window size at the backoff stage j in the priority i class
can be shown as

2.3 Saturation Delay Analysis
In this section, we will consider a population of n STAs. Each STA operates in saturation with
channel error conditions. The saturation delay is defined as the time interval between the
generation of a frame until an acknowledgement that this frame has been received. If a frame is
dropped because it has reached the specified retry limit, the time delay for this frame will not be
included in the calculation. The mean frame delay can be defined as follows:

bytes, PHY header = 16 bytes, ACK = 14 bytes, RTS = 20 bytes, CTS = 14 bytes, SIFS = 20 us,
DIFS = 50 us, propagation delay = 1 us, slot time = 20 us, and
0,0, 1,0 2,0 3,0[ ] [16 32 64 128]W W W W  .
We first finished the numerical simulation under the channel error scenarios and compare it
with the model under an ideal channel. Fig. 2.2 shows the saturation throughput performance of
our proposed model with different priorities using the RTS/CTS CSMA/CA mechanism under an
ideal channel scenario. Fig. 2.3 depicts the saturation throughput performance of our proposed
model with different priorities using the RTS/CTS CSMA/CA mechanism under a channel error
scenario. From the results, we can conclude that the Markov chain model under an ideal channel
scenario can achieve higher performance than the model under a channel error scenario because
the model under a channel error scenario considers the channel error conditions. The saturation
throughput will decrease due to the channel error.
Fig. 2.4 shows the saturation delay performance of our proposed model with different
priorities using the RTS/CTS CSMA/CA mechanism under an ideal channel scenario. Fig. 2.5
depictions show the saturation delay performance of our proposed model with different priorities
using the RTS/CTS CSMA/CA mechanism under a channel error scenario. Under the channel
error scenario, the frame may be received unsuccessfully due to the channel error. The
unsuccessful results received increases the saturation delay. From Fig. 2.4 to Fig. 2.5, we
conclude that due to the frame that is unsuccessfully received, the model under an ideal channel
scenario can achieve a better performance than that under a channel error scenario.

3.1 Overview of TXOP and Block ACK Mechanisms
In IEEE 802.11e, the TXOP is a time period when a particular station (STA) that wins the
channel access has the right to initiate transmission along with the EDCF parameters of
AIFS[AC], CWmin[AC], and CWmax[AC]. During the TXOP, STA is allowed to transmit more than
one frame with a short inter-frame (SIFS) time gap between an ACK and the subsequent frame
transmission without the backoff process Since SIFS is used for frame separations, the other
STAs cannot gain channel access because they must wait at least a DIFS interval. The TXOP
frame structure is shown in Fig. 3.1.

Another feature in IEEE 802.1e is Block ACK (B_ACK) mechanism. In IEEE 802.11e, a STA
must receive an ACK frame to confirm a successful transmission. The Block ACK is defined in
order to reduce the channel wastes due to the ACK transmission. The Block ACK mechanism
improves channel efficiency by aggregating several ACKs into one frame. This mechanism
allows a block of frames to be transmitted, each separated by a SIFS period, and to be
acknowledged by a final aggregated ACK frame, which is called Block ACK (B_ACK) frame as
shown in Fig. 3.2. The Block ACK contains information about the reception of the whole block

3.2 Performance Analysis of EDCF with TXOP and Block ACK
Mechanism
The purpose of our analysis is to evaluate the saturation throughput and the delay
performances of EDCF with TXOP and Block ACK mechanisms under ideal channel and channel
error scenarios. Based on the previous description, we can derive the close forms for system
performance metrics of saturation throughput and delay.
3.2.1 Saturation Throughput and Delay Analysis of EDCF with TXOP Mechanism
From the analysis that was depicted in the previous chapter, the transmission probability is
related to CW size and AIFS[AC]. When deriving the saturation throughput and delay with
different TXOP durations, the collision probability and the transmission probability of a STA are
the same as those derived in chapter 4. However, the equations relating to the transmission time
of each successful contention will be different for the different ACs, i.e., different ACs are
assigned different TXOP durations. We assume that the system is under an environment of
channel error and having the RTS/CTS CSMA/CA mechanism. Thus, we can obtain

3.2.2 Saturation Throughput and Delay Analysis of EDCF with Block ACK Mechanism
According to the description in the previous chapter, the saturation throughput is defined as
the frame information in a slot time that is successfully transmitted in an expected slot duration.
There are four types of states in the B_ACK mechanism: 1) None of the STAs transmit at any

Where bP is the bit error rate, and xxxL is the length of different types of frames. ,
xxx
e iP is
the frame error rate of the frame type xxx for the priority i class. The time duration of the
different frame types xxx due to channel error are as follows:

From the previous description, saturation delay is defined as the time elapsed between the
generation of a frame and its successful reception. We can obtain that the saturation delay of the
B_ACK mechanism is the same as that defined as in (3-14) to (3-17), and that , ,,S i C iT T are the
same as (3-18), (3-19), respectively.
3.3 Numerical Results
In this section, we assume that the numerical parameters are the same as in chapter 2. First,
we finished the numerical simulation of the TXOP mechanism with the RTS/CTS CSMA/CA
access scheme under the channel error scenarios and compared it with the model that is without
the TXOP mechanism. Fig. 3.3 shows the saturation throughput performance of the TXOP
mechanism with the RTS/CTS CSMA/CA access scheme for different priority STAs under a
channel error scenario. Fig. 3.4 depicts the saturation throughput performance of different priority
40
scenario has less channel errors. The saturation delay performances of different priority STAs
using the RTS/CTS CSMA/CA scheme with the B_ACK mechanism under a non-ideal channel
scenario are shown in Fig. 3.19 to Fig. 3.22. From the figures, we can conclude that the delay
decreases as the SNR increases because a higher SNR scenario has less channel errors; therefore,
the STAs wait less time to transmit frames.

due to fact that the modified model with the TXOP mechanism is allowed to transmit multiple
frames during the TXOP duration. When a modified model has the B_ACK mechanism under a
high SNR scenario, the system can achieve a higher performance than that in a lower SNR
scenario because a higher SNR scenario has less channel errors.
