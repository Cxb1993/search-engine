Abstract 
 
The proposed three-year research programme aims to study liquid-granular flows 
using novel experimental and computational approaches. Encountered in a variety of 
civil engineering applications, liquid-granular flows involve interactions between a 
dispersed granular phase and a carrier liquid. Debris flows, sediment-laden currents, 
and dredging slurries constitute examples of great practical concern. Such flows are 
difficult to study because they are inherently three-dimensional at the granular scale, 
and also because they strongly couple the solid and liquid and play a crucial role. 
To deal with these phenomena, we propose to combine experimental and 
computational methods developed recently in our laboratory. The experimental 
techniques designed specifically to study 3D liquid-granular flows include four 
components: 1) special testing apparatus including a recirculating rectilinear shear 
flow flume; 2) refractive-index matched solid and liquid material through laser 
marking of particle cores and laser illumination of seeding particles; 4) image analysis 
algorithms allowing quantitative measurements of 3D motions. 
Numerical methods, on the other hand, include 3D Navier-Stokes computations 
in the velocity-vorticity formulation, and simulations of multi-body dynamics 
immersed in a liquid modeled by meshless calculations. Developed over the last years, 
both the experimental and computational tools have been successfully tested on 
simple case. The proposed project seeks to refine these tools, to compare their results 
with each other, and to use them to probe the fundamental mechanics of 
liquid-granular flows in configurations of gradually increasing complexity.

2. Results and Discussions 
The results obtained by the research can be summarized in two categories: First, 
results which we have already published or submitted for publication [1-17]. Secondly, 
more recent results for which publication is in preparation.  
 
Results for which publications are currently in preparation include the following: 
 
 Development and operation of high-speed debris flow experimental facility 
We have devised and implemented a unique facility for the study of debris flows, 
which is now fully operational. The facility allows the study of steady surges, made 
stationary in the laboratory frame of reference by way of a conveyor belt. The 
measurement system includes a high-power laser (up to 5W) and a high-speed camera. 
Access to the interior of the flow is achieved by using refractive index matched 
materials. Illustrated below, the system can capture solid-liquid flows of up to 1.5 m/s 
at a rate of 600 cross-sectional images per second, or more than 100 times faster than 
state-of-the art dynamic MRI.

belt, and made transparent despite the high solid concentration by matching the 
refractive indices of the solid and liquid phases.   
 
 Internal imaging using refractive index matching, laser illumination, and 
stereoscopic motion capture 
The flume was designed to allow use of special solid and liquid materials, 
characterized by matched indices of refraction (Table 1). This allows unhindered 
optical access to the inside of high-concentrated solid-liquid mixtures. We can then 
image the corresponding internal motions either by illuminating a transverse 
cross-section of the flow using a laser light sheet, or by acquiring the motions of a 
subset of colored particles using stereoscopic imaging.

particles in a lid-driven cavity flow

Abstract Stereo imaging methods are used to measure
the positions of solid spherical particles suspended in a
viscous liquid and enclosed in a transparent cubic cavity.
The liquid and particle motions are driven at the top lid
by a conveyor belt operated at constant speed. Based on
sequences of stereo views of the full cavity, the particles
are tracked continuously along their three-dimensional
orbits. The corresponding position histories are treated
as noisy stochastic data and processed using Kalman
ﬁlters to ﬁll data gaps and attenuate the eﬀect of mea-
surement errors. The lid-driven viscous ﬂow is charac-
terised by an intricate internal structure which is
mirrored in the particle paths. The tracks of the solid
particles align with long exposure images of laser-illu-
minated micro-particles in selected transverse planes.
Nevertheless, their long time trajectories appear to
cluster along preferential pathways of the internal cir-
culation pattern.
1 Introduction
Fluid motions are often made visible by seeding the ﬂow
with tracer particles. Much information can then be
gained by registering particle displacements over short
time intervals using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) or
particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). A single camera can
be used to capture two-dimensional (2D) displacements,
or stereo cameras can be used when 3D displacements are
of interest. For ﬂuids seeded with micro-particles,
measurements are commonly facilitated by illuminating
only a thin slice of a ﬂow using a continuous or a pulsed
laser. If the seeding is not too sparse, and if multiple slices
can be acquired, collections of short particle tracks can
then be assembled into detailed Eulerian ﬂow ﬁelds
(Adrian 1991, 2005).
An alternative is to adopt a Lagrangian point of view.
Instead of short time displacements, one seeks to capture
the long-term trajectories of the particles as they move
about the domain. Valuable insights into the ﬂow
structure can then be gained from these long time orbits.
For 3D ﬂow ﬁelds, however, this approach runs into a
number of diﬃculties. First, long trajectories cannot be
registered using laser illumination because particles
would move in and out of the light sheet. Next, the
micro-particles which respond only to laser illumination
are no longer appropriate, and one must work instead
with visible solid particles of greater size. This in turn
raises concerns about whether the motions of the solid
particles do indeed closely reﬂect the motions of the
embedding ﬂuid. These concerns can be minimised by
using sparsely seeded, neutrally buoyant particles. Yet
even under such precautions, deviations may occur be-
cause of ﬁnite size eﬀects or inertial migration (Han
et al. 1999; Matas et al. 2004).
An intriguing example of cross-stream particle mo-
tions is provided by inertial migration in non-homoge-
neous laminar shear ﬂows. The simplest case is that of
Poiseuille ﬂow, sparsely seeded with neutrally buoyant
solid particles of ﬁnite size. Experimental observations
show that the particles do not distribute themselves
evenly over the cross-section of the circular pipe, instead
they migrate towards ring-shaped regions of preferential
concentration (Segre´ and Silberberg 1962; Matas et al.
2004). It is currently unclear how such eﬀects play out in
ﬂows exhibiting a fully 3D internal structure.
Acquiring 3D particle trajectories over long time
intervals further requires special imaging methods. Since
a laser sheet cannot be used to sample particle positions
within a known plane, full volume stereo imaging must
be used. To reconstruct the trajectories of individual
particles, furthermore, PTV must be adopted. Special

Experiments and simplified computations are performed to study the influence of liquid motions on
the dynamics of immersed pendulums. The pendulums consist of tethered spheres, swinging alone
or colliding with one another in liquid initially at rest. Surprisingly, oscillations initiated in identical
fashion are found to be damped less rapidly when spheres collide. Using refractive-index-matched
materials and laser-illuminated tracers to visualize the flow between and around the spheres, we link
this effect to the response of wake vortices. Set in motion by impact, a sphere emerges nearly
wake-free from the collision, leading to reduced drag and enhanced upswing. © 2007 American

Like dry granular flows, liquid-granular flows are
strongly affected by collisions between solid particles.1,2
Coupling between solid and liquid motions, however, modu-
lates the influence of immersed collisions on the stress and
energy balance of mixture flows. Studies of immersed
particle-wall3,4 and particle-particle collisions5 have docu-
mented how particle rebound is damped by liquid viscosity.
In particle-wall collisions, liquid vorticity has also been
found to play a role.6 For particle-particle collisions, the role
of vorticity has not yet been examined. In this Letter, we
show that vortex responses to particle-particle collisions can
exert a significant influence on the particle dynamics. In im-
mersed pendulum experiments conducted at high Reynolds
and Stokes numbers, we find that the oscillations of spherical
bobs are damped less rapidly when they collide with one
another than when they swing alone.
Experiments with tethered spheres have been used re-
cently to investigate sphere-vortex interactions7 and im-
mersed collisions.3,5 To clarify the interplay between vortex
motions and immersed collisions, we conducted experiments
with both isolated and colliding spheres, in the pendulum
configurations illustrated in Fig. 1. Each pendulum has
height H=180 mm and features a spherical bob of diameter
D=40 mm immersed in liquid in a tank of dimensions
500400350 mm3. To provide lateral restraint, a bifilar
suspension is adopted. Oblique strings 0.3 mm in diameter
are attached to small screws on opposite sides of each
sphere, and suspended from rigid supports on both sides of
the plane of swing. Sphere motion is initiated by gentle
manual release from a rigid railed guide, with the released
pendulum starting from angle 0=−1 rad. In the single pen-
dulum experiments Fig. 1a, the released sphere oscillates
alone in the liquid. In the colliding pendulums experiments
Fig. 1b, by contrast, the released sphere impacts the bob
of another identical pendulum, initially at rest and suspended
one sphere diameter away.
To facilitate observation, the refractive-index-matched
transparent materials proposed in Ref. 8 are used. The solid
spheres are made of polymethyl methacrylate density
S=1190 kg m−3 and bathed in the liquid para-cymene den-
sity L=860 kg m−3, viscosity L=1.0210−3 Pa s. The
materials share the same index of refraction, allowing light
passage and visual access through the spheres. A binocular
camera arrangement is used to obtain stereo measurements of
the sphere motions. The centroids of the screw heads
mounted on both sides of each sphere are extracted from
synchronized images resolution 7781032 pixels acquired
at frame rate 20 Hz. Their three-dimensional positions are
then determined by ray intersection9 followed by a distortion
correction, yielding a spatial accuracy of 0.6 mm. Excursions
left and right of the plane of swing due to lateral sway do not
exceed 4 mm. Runs are given a common time origin by find-
ing the instant at which the released bob crosses angle 
=−0.2 rad during its first downswing. Angular swing veloci-
ties are obtained by differencing, and extrapolated to the
times of collision to obtain pre- and post-collision speeds.
Measured swing histories for the single and colliding
pendulums are compared in Fig. 2a, with each curve rep-
resenting an average of 40 stereoscopic experiments. As
could be expected, the immersed bobs undergo subcritically
damped oscillations. For colliding pendulums, these oscilla-
tions are interrupted by repeated impacts. The released bob
swings down, comes to an abrupt near-stop at the first colli-
sion as the target bob swings up, before the bobs collide
again upon reverse downswing, and so on. During the
first downswing, the released bobs in the single and colliding
pendulums experiments exhibit indistinguishable angle
histories, attaining maximum angular swing velocities
˙max=2.221±0.024 rad s−1 and ˙1
max
=2.215±0.025 rad s−1,
respectively mean ± one standard deviation, corresponding
to a Reynolds number Re13 500. After the first collision,
however, the curves of the single and target bobs diverge.
Surprisingly, the bob set in motion by impact rises higher
than the isolated bob, attaining a maximum upswing
angle 2
max
=0.333±0.017 rad, compared to value max
=0.271±0.021 rad for the single bob, or a relative increase
of 23%. Moreover, this enhanced upswing is sustained over
at least one more cycle interrupted by two further collisions
Fig. 2a. Follow-up experiments performed in identical
conditions with spheres of size D=30 and 50 mm instead of
40 mm exhibit the same effect, yielding increases in maxi-
mum upswing of 32 and 30%, respectively.
