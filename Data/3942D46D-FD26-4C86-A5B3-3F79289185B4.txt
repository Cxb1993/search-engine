I.  Introduction  
The Fourier transform (FT) is defined as: 
  FT: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )ò
¥
¥-
- -= dxxfxjF wpw exp2 2/1 ,        x, w Î (-¥, ¥). (1)           
Note that, in both the space and frequency domains, the intervals are (-¥, ¥). However, due to 
the finite size of the implementing components, the infinite interval is always impossible. In 
practice, we perform the finite Fourier transform (fi-FT) instead of the FT:    
  fi-FT: ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )ò- -=
T
T
dxxfxjF wpw exp2~ 2/1      space interval: x Î [-T, T],     (2) 
                                           frequency interval: w Î [-W, W].   
Since the intervals are finite, after doing the fi-FT, some energy is lost. For the original FT, the 
energy preservation property is satisfied:

However, for the fi-FT, the energy ratio of F̃(w) to f(x) is smaller than 1:

Then one may ask in what condition the energy ratio is maximal. In 1961, Slepian and Pollak 
found that these problems could be analyzed by the prolate spheroidal function. 1,2,3       
Prolate spheroidal functions are the continuous functions that satisfy:

There are infinite functions can satisfy (5). We can sort them according to the values of l n,T,W’s:    
  1 > l0,T,W > l1,T,W > l2,T,W > …………. > 0.       (All of l n,T,W’s are real)       (6) 
Prolate spheroidal functions are orthogonal in the intervals of both x Î [-T, T] and x Î (-¥, ¥):

fi-FRFT, the fi-LCT, and the offset fi-LCT. We consider not only the case where the interval is 
centered at zero but also the cases where the center is departed from zero. In Sec. 3, we derive 
some important properties of the generalized prolate spheroidal functions. In Sec. 4, we 
illustrate how to use the generalized prolate spheroidal functions to analyze the 
energy-preservation ratio, the self-imaging phenomenon, and the resonance phenomenon of the 
finite-sized optical system. We also consider the case where the optical system is a cascade of 
several finite-sized optical systems, i.e., the multiple stage case.

It is a generalization of the FT. When a = p/2, the FRFT becomes the FT. When a = -p/2, the 
FRFT becomes the IFT. The linear canonical transform (LCT) is a further generalization of 
FRFTs. It is defined as: 9,10

2-2  Generalized Prolate Spheroidal Functions for fi-FRFTs and the fi-LCTs      
In this subsection, we derive the function set that can analyze the energy preservation 
property of the fi-FRFT and the fi-LCT. Here we consider the case where the intervals are 
centered at zero, i.e., in (16) and (17),      
  [T1, T2] = [-T, T],             [W1, W2] = [-W, W].      (19) 
Since the fi-FRFT is a special case of the fi-LCT, in the following, we just discuss the case of 
the fi-LCT.             
The energy preservation ratio of the fi-LCT can be calculated from:

Moreover, since the original prolate spheroidal functions {y0,T/|b|,W(x), y1,T/|b|,W(x), y2,T/|b|,W(x), 
y3,T/|b|,W(x) …….. } are complete, so {f0,T,W(x), f1,T,W(x), f2,T,W(x), f3,T,W(x) ……..} are also 
complete. Since {fn,T,W(x) | n Î Z+} forms an orthogonal and complete function set, any 
function can be expressed as a linear combination of f0,T,W(x), f1,T,W(x), f2,T,W(x), f3,T,W(x) ……..:

offset fi-LCT is just the modulation of that of the fi-LCT. The offset fi-LCT has six parameters, 
however, only three of them (a, b, and t) affect the form of the generalized prolate spheroidal 
function. The generalized prolate spheroidal functions of the offset fi-LCT also satisfy the 
orthogonal properties in (28). They form a complete orthogonal functions set in the interval of x 
Î [-T, T]. We can also use the way as in (32) to analyze the energy preservation ratio of the 
offset fi-LCT.    
 
2-4  The Cases of Non-symmetric Intervals  
In subsections 2-2 and 2-3, we discussed how to use the generalized prolate spheroidal 
function to analyze the energy preservation ratio for the fi-FRFT, the fi-LCT, and the offset 
fi-LCT. We limited the space interval and the frequency interval to be symmetric about zero 
(i.e., x Î [-T, T] and u Î [-W, W]). However, in practice, it is very often that the intervals are 
not symmetric. In this subsection, we discuss the cases where the space and frequency intervals

parameters {a, b, c, d, t1, r1} and the intervals of the offset fi-LCT are centered at zero. From 
(41) in subsec. 2-3, we know that the generalized prolate spheroidal function corresponding to 
the offset fi-LCT in (51) is:

That is, if the product of the space and frequency intervals is fixed, when we change the space 
interval, the amplitude of the generalized prolate spheroidal function is almost unchanged 
except for some scaling.                   
In fact, the amplitude of fn,T1,T2,W1,W2(x) is determined by yn,T3/|b|,W3(x), which is the original 
prolate spheroidal function, and when the difference of scaling is ignored, yn,T3/|b|,W3(x) is 
determined by the product of T3/|b| and W3. Thus only the following product really affects the 
amplitude of the generalized prolate spheroidal function.

Note that, although the general form of the fi-LCT (see (18)) with non-symmetric intervals 
has 10 parameters {a, b, c, d, t, r, T1, T2, W1, W2}, however, from (53) and property 2,           
(a) Only the product P in (64) really affects the amplitude.    
(b) The parameter b affects the scale.   
(c) The ratio of a/b affects the chirp term.   
(d) T0 = (T1+T2)/2 affects the amount of space-shifting.               
(e) W0 = (W1+W2)/2 and t affect the modulation.               
(f) Other parameters in fact have no effect.

In usual, the generalized prolate spheroidal function is not the eigenfunction of the offset 
fi-LCT. However, from (68), we can see that, when we do the offset fi-LCT for the generalized 
prolate spheroidal function, the input and the output are just different in the following terms:  
   scaling,   time-shifting,   chirp multiplication,   modulation.  
When discussing the self-imaging phenomenon (see subsection 4-3), all the above terms can be 
ignored. Thus the generalized prolate spheroidal function can be viewed as the quasi 
eigenfunction of the offset fi-LCT and its special cases (including the fi-FRFT and the fi-LCT).     
Specially, when               
  T1 = W1,   T2 = W2,   (i.e., T0 = W0 and T3 = W3),      
  d = -a,   and   [ ]01 2)1( Tdb +-= - tr          (70) 
then, in (68) and (69), k1 = 1 and k2 = k3 = k4 = 0, and the generalized prolate spheroidal 
function is the eigenfunction of the offset fi-LCT.  
(5) Differential equation

refractive index of the medium. The effect of the free space with length z is equivalent to the 
offset LCT with parameters {a, b, c, d, t, r} = {1, z/k, 0, 1, 0, 0} (i.e., the Fresnel transform). If 
we use gi(x) and go(u) to represent the light distributions at the input and the output, respectively, 
then, from the additivity property of the offset LCT 14,15, we find that the whole system can be 
expressed as a special case of the offset fi-LCT:

The summations in (83) is the sum of infinite number of terms. However, due to the facts that 
|mq,n| = hq,n1/2 (It is satisfied for all the finite transforms discussed in this paper) and that hq,n is 
very small when n is large, we can change it into the sums of finite terms. We can choose a 
threshold e (near to 0) and find Nq such that:   
  hq,n < e        when n > Nq.                    (84)

Note that B is an (N1+1)´(N1+1) matrix and fn (n = 0 ~ N1) is an eigenvector of B. The size of fn 
is 1´(N1+1). Due to the fact that B is the product of a matrix and its Hermitian form (i.e., B = 
ÃÃH where Ã = |L1|-1A|LQ|), the eigenvalues kn’s are real and positive. Moreover, since BH = B, 
the eigenvectors fn’s are orthogonal (i.e., fmfnH = 0 if m ¹ n). We can sort fn according to kn:                  
  1> k0 > k1 > k2 > …… > kN1 > 0              (97)

4-3  Analyzing Self-Imaging Phenomena

preservation ratio of the finite-sized optical system, but also use it to analyze the self-imaging 
phenomenon. If the effect of the finite size of optical components is ignored, we can use the

phenomenon was formed.  
Therefore, although the generalized prolate spheroidal function fn,T1,T2,W1,W2(x) is not the 
eigenfunction of the offset fi-LCT, it can cause the self-imaging phenomenon for the optical 
system that can be modeled by the offset fi-LCT.            
In addition to the generalized prolate spheroidal function, the linear combination of the 
generalized prolate spheroidal functions with the same values of mn can also cause the 
self-imaging phenomenon. Strictly speaking, the eigenvalues of the generalized prolate 
spheroidal functions are different from one another (i.e., mn ¹ mm if n ¹ m). However, if the 
product of T and W is not too small, there are several generalized prolate spheroidal functions 
whose values of |mn| = 2/1 ,,,, 2121 WWTTnh  are near to 1:    
  1 > |mn| > 1 - D         when 0 £ n £ Ñ,  D is very small.            (107) 
In other words, |mn| » 1 when n £ Ñ and in (69)

  emD = rn em,    (118)

Thus the light distribution as in (120) will cause the self-imaging phenomenon for the multiple 
stage optical system. 
 
4-4  Resonance phenomenon               
Analyzing the resonance phenomenon is another application of the generalized prolate 
spheroidal function. Suppose that there is a spherical mirror pair system, as in Fig. 3. It has 
been known that we can use the eigenfunctions of the LCT and the offset LCT to analyze the 
resonance phenomenon of the spherical mirror pair system 15. However, since in practice the 
size of the mirror pair system is finite, to obtain more precise results, it is proper to use the 
generalized prolate spheroidal function instead of the eigenfunctions of the LCT and the offset 
LCT to analyze the resonance phenomenon.                 
Suppose that the durations of the two spherical mirrors in Fig. 3 are: 
  Mirror A: x Î [XA1, XA2],  y Î [YA1, YA2],   Mirror B: x Î [XB1, XB2],  y Î [YB1, YB2]. (122)

apply them (except for that the number of stages is 2) to determine which input fi,0(x, y) can 
cause the resonance phenomena for the optical system in Fig. 3.       
 
V.  Conclusions       
In the literature, the prolate spheroidal function for the fi-FT was derived. In this paper, we 
extend the previous works and derived the generalized prolate spheroidal functions for the 
fi-FRFT (a generalization of the fi-FT), the fi-LCT (a further generalization of the fi-LCT), and 
the offset fi-LCT (the fi-LCT with two extra offset parameters). In addition, in the literature, the 
prolate spheroidal function was often used for analyzing the case where the duration is centered 
at zero. In this paper, with the results in subsection 2-4, we can analyze the case where the 
interval is not symmetric about zero.   
Since the generalized prolate spheroidal functions corresponding to the fi-FRFT, the 
fi-LCT, and the offset fi-LCT are derived, and many optical systems can be represented by 
these three finite operations, some theory about finite-sized optical system analysis can be 
developed. We can use the generalized prolate spheroidal functions derived in this paper to 
analyze the energy preservation ratio, the self-imaging phenomenon, and the resonance 
phenomenon of the finite sized optical system.
