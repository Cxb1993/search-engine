一、報 告 內 容 
 
在本計劃中，我們設計了一個新的藍芽 SCO 連線與 IEEE 802.11 無線區域網
路之共存機制，稱為藍芽 SCO 連線干擾消除機制  (Bluetooth SCO-link 
Interference Mitigation, BSIM)，來避免藍芽裝置間的聲音傳輸受到 WLAN 之干
擾。我們利用藍芽時槽與時槽之間有 259µs 的 turnaround time，在 SCO 時槽開始
前送出一段測試訊號，這段測試訊號讓 WLAN 可以在藍芽 SCO 封包開始傳送之
前偵測到藍芽裝置，以便延後 WLAN 封包的傳送，避開和藍芽 SCO 連線封包碰
撞的機會。此共存機制有以下三個優點： 
 
 在佈滿 WLAN 基地台與 WLAN 頻道佔滿 2.4 GHz ISM 頻帶的環境中，
可以確保藍芽語音通話不會受到干擾。 
 此方法為 non-collaborative，不需要額外的訊息交換。 
 僅需小幅度修改 Bluetooth 標準與 802.11 標準即可運作。 
 
本計畫考慮到所提的 BSIM 機制可能會對 WLAN 造成影響，所以又提出
E-BSIM，利用藍芽新的封包格式，避開 WLAN 所使用的頻道並主動選擇未受到
干擾的頻道序列，來降低 WLAN 受到藍芽的影響。在 2.4 GHz ISM 頻帶被 WLAN
佔滿的情況下，E-BSIM 依然能確保 SCO 連線的傳輸品質。 
 
我們做了三個模擬實驗來分析藍芽 SCO連線和WLAN此兩種不同的無線網
路技術相互干擾的情況。第一個實驗是評估 WLAN 對藍芽 SCO 連線所造成的影
響，包括 802.11b 網路與 802.11g 網路。此實驗是在證明藍芽 SCO 連線確實受到
WLAN 的影響甚鉅，使得我們必須要針對藍芽 SCO 連線提出方法來改善其效
能。第二個實驗是評估藍芽 SCO 連線對 WLAN 所造成的影響。第三個實驗是將
我們所提出的方法與其他 SCO 連線方式在相同環境中的效能做比較。所有實驗
皆以網路模擬器 NS-2 (Network Simulator version 2) 搭配 Bluetooth 模組(UCBT)
來完成。以下是我們實驗的結果及分析。 
 
實驗一、WLAN對藍芽 SCO連線所造成的影響 
 
在本實驗中我們分析了三種不同藍芽 SCO 連線所使用的封包，分別是
HV3、HV2 與 HV1 封包。模擬環境中包含兩個藍芽裝置以 SCO 連線連接，並分
別使用一組及兩組頻道的 802.11b 工作站。我們用 SCO 連線的生產量來表示藍
芽設備語音通訊品質的好壞。當藍芽 SCO 連線生產量越接近理想值時，代表語
音通訊的品質越好，模擬時間設定為 30 秒。由於藍芽將時槽分割成每秒 1600

我們用同樣的方法來實驗藍芽 SCO 連線在 802.11g 網路環境下受到干擾的
情形。模擬結果顯示藍芽 SCO 連線被 802.11g 網路干擾的情況和被 802.11b 網路
干擾的情況相似，都是得到斷斷續續的結果，但 802.11g 對藍芽 SCO 連線的干
擾稍微小一點。這個差異也許是因為 802.11g 網路所佔用 2.4 GHz ISM 頻帶的頻
寬較小，並且使用 OFDM 技術所致。從圖 1.4 (a) 與 (b) 的結果可以看出，在受
到 802.11b 干擾的情況下，藍芽 SCO 連線平均生產量的下降速度比受到 802.11g
的干擾還要快。

使用了兩組藍芽語音連線，WLAN 方面則是使用 802.11b 的實體層技術，並且由
802.11b 工作站傳送 FTP 資料流。結果顯示 BSIM 機制也會對 WLAN 的生產量
造成影響，但是和沒有任何共存機制的 HV3 連線相比較，差別並不大。這是因
為在 HV3 連線或 BSIM 機制的影響下，WLAN 可能會延遲傳送，而導致WLAN
的生產量斷斷續續。然而 E-BSIM 利用了新的 EV型態封包格式，使得 E-BSIM
可以降低對 WLAN 效能所帶來的影響。

WLAN 佔滿的情況下，E-BSIM 依然能確保 SCO 連線的傳輸品質。 
由我們所做的三個模擬實驗之結果，證明了在沒有共存機制的情況下，藍芽
SCO 連線受干擾的情況是很嚴重的，本計畫提出的共存機制確保了藍芽 SCO 連
線的通訊品質，並且在藍芽 SCO 連線和 WLAN 共存的環境下並沒有犧牲太多
WLAN 的效能。

this study investigates the problem of mutual interference between Bluetooth SCO link and IEEE 802.11 
WLAN, and presents solutions to this problem. 
Bluetooth voice applications are based on a Bluetooth SCO (synchronous connection-oriented) link, 
which is applied to send real-time voice and multimedia packets. However, such a link is most 
susceptible to interference, particularly by WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks). An in-band adjacent 
WLAN network can almost make the voice quality of a Bluetooth SCO link unacceptable to users [3]. 
Since Bluetooth voice applications are becoming increasingly important, this study investigates the 
problem of mutual interference between Bluetooth SCO link and IEEE 802.11 WLAN, and presents 
solutions to this problem. 
As is well known, Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 WLAN both function in the 2.4 GHz ISM band; however, 
they adopt different operating methods. The most significant difference between them is that Bluetooth 
adopts a frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) scheme, while WLAN can either use an FHSS or a 
direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique. This study considers a WLAN operating in DSSS, 
since most WLAN products in today’s market support DSSS technology. Although the transmission range 
of WLAN is about 100 meters, Bluetooth can only reach up to 10 meters. The wider range of WLAN 
makes it liable to cover and interfere with Bluetooth. Particularly, WLAN has become so popular recently 
that an area may contain several WLANs. If more than two WLANs using different channels exist in the 
same area, then the 2.4 GHz ISM band becomes fully occupied, making Bluetooth’s FHSS system 
infeasible. Section 3 will address this problem in detail 
To minimize the mutual interference between WLAN and Bluetooth devices, working groups IEEE 
802.15 and 802.11 have joined together to develop coexistence mechanisms. In 2003, this joint working 
group announced the new IEEE 802.15.2 standard including several coexistence mechanisms, which 
enable IEEE 802.11(abbreviated as 802.11 and meant by WLAN in subsequence of this paper) and 
Bluetooth to operate in a shared environment without significantly affecting each other’s performance. 
IEEE 802.15.2 defines two classes of coexistence mechanism, i.e., collaborative and non-collaborative 
mechanisms. Collaborative coexistence mechanisms need to exchange information between WLAN and 
Bluetooth, and require communication between WLAN and Bluetooth. However, these mechanisms can 
only be implemented when Bluetooth and 802.11 wireless technologies are collocated in the same device. 
Conversely, non-collaborative mechanisms do not have to exchange information between these two 
wireless networks. In other words, WLAN and Bluetooth operate independently without exchanging 
information when they apply non-collaborative mechanism. Consequently, these two devices must be 
able to detect each other’s presence. 
This study presents two new coexistence mechanisms for Bluetooth SCO links, namely the Bluetooth 
SCO link Interference Mitigation (BSIM) scheme and Enhanced BSIM (E-BSIM). Both mechanisms are 
non-collaborative, meaning that they do not have to exchange information between two different wireless 
devices while the mechanism is in operation. The reason for designing a non-collaborative technique 
rather than a collaborative technique is that except for some high-priced PDA cell phones, most cell 
phones in today’s market do not provide a built-in WLAN function. Furthermore, WLAN consumes more 
  
 12 
 
any overlap in frequency between Bluetooth and WLAN. 
BIAS, like AFH, also classifies Bluetooth channels as “good” and “bad”. However, unlike AFH, BIAS is 
a backoff policy that postpones packet transmission until a slot associated with a “good” frequency 
becomes available [11]. BCS senses the channel condition during the Bluetooth slot turnaround time. 
Therefore, the next channel is checked before starting packet transmission [10]. The concept of BCS is 
similar to that of the CSMA/CA mechanism in IEEE 802.11. ISO AFH utilizes the WLAN/Bluetooth 
channel mapping table to estimate which channel is occupied by WLAN stations, and adjusts the 
Bluetooth hopping sequence to unused frequencies. 
 
3. System Background 
3.1 WLANs 
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) adhere to the IEEE 802.11 standard. The standard contains 
several supplements, such as 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, which increase the variety of possible PHY 
implementations. A WLAN covers a range of approximately 100 m, and can operate at speeds of up to 11 
Mbps for 802.11b and 54 Mbps for 802.11a/g, providing two basic network structures, an ad hoc network 
and infrastructure network. In an ad hoc network, also called a MANET (mobile ad hoc network), stations 
communicate directly with each other, so must be within a direct communication range. Ad hoc networks 
enable a small number of stations to be set up for a special purpose at any time and anywhere. 
Infrastructure networks are distinguished from ad hoc networks by the use of an access point (AP). 
Access points are used for all communications in infrastructure networks, including communication 
between mobile nodes in the same service area. The IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer defines two wireless 
media access schemes, the distributed coordination function (DCF) and the point coordination function 
(PCF). The fundamental access method of DCF is carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance 
(CSMA/CA). Since collisions waste valuable wireless transmission capacity, IEEE 802.11 uses collision 
avoidance (CSMA/CA) to control access to the transmission medium 
Based on polling controlled by the point coordinator, PCF provides contention-free services. Since 
point coordinators reside only in access points, PCF access scheme is restricted to the infrastructure 
networks. However, DCF can be used either in infrastructure networks or in ad hoc networks. 
 
3.2 Bluetooth 
Bluetooth wireless technology is a short-range communications system intended to replace the cables 
that connect portable and/or fixed electronic peripherals [1]. Bluetooth version 1.2 can support a data rate 
of approximately 1 Mbps. However, Bluetooth version 2.0, launched in November 2004, has a new 
enhanced data rate (EDR) of up to 3 Mbps. The basic architecture of Bluetooth networks is the piconet, 
which comprises a master device and up to seven active slave devices. The master controls the 
transmission by polling the slaves in a piconet. The Bluetooth PHY layer adopts FHSS with a hop rate of 
1600hops/second and a time slot of 1/1600 seconds = 625µs. Master transmissions always start at even

Fig. 1. Timing diagram for SCO links 
 
The probability that Bluetooth and WLAN overlap in frequency equals the probability that Bluetooth 
hops into the 22 MHz WLAN band [8, 9]. This probability would be 22/79 when no coexistence 
mechanism is applied. Therefore, the loss frequency of SCO slot, LF, can be written as

For instance, if one WLAN channel is available within the Bluetooth transmission range, then the SCO

This slot loss frequency is high enough for the voice received by the Bluetooth headset to be 
intermittent. From Eq. (1), since the LF depends on the format of the SCO packet, and is proportional to 
the number of existing WLAN channel, the interference to the SCO link from the WLAN signal becomes 
more severe as the number of WLAN channels in the same area increases. Experimental results reveal 
that the Bluetooth voice information cannot be recognized if more than two WLAN channels exist. 
 
4. The Proposed Mechanisms 
Although the coexistence mechanisms previously introduced improve the coexistence of Bluetooth 
and WLANs, none of these resolve the problem of interference with the Bluetooth SCO link from the 
WLAN. This study proposes two mechanisms to ensure the quality of Bluetooth voice communications 
when the 2.4 GHz ISM band is fully occupied by WLAN channels. The first mechanism, Bluetooth 
SCO-link Interference Mitigation (BSIM), is applied to the Bluetooth specification version 1.1 and before. 
BSIM postpones the transmission of WLAN packets while they overlap with Bluetooth SCO packets. The 
second mechanism, E-BSIM (Enhanced BSIM), is applied to the Bluetooth specification version 1.2 and 
later. E-BSIM employs the new packet format, EV-type packet in Bluetooth specification version 1.2, to 
enhance the WLAN’s performance, alongside the BSIM coexistence mechanism.

(c) Fig.2. Time slot overlapping between Bluetooth and WLAN 
 
Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the elaborate IEEE 802.11 MAC operation and the 
Bluetooth slot timing. The CSMA/CA procedure begins at an interframe space (IFS) time, and is specified 
in IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer [2]. Four different IFSs, namely SIFS(short interframe space), PIFS(PCF 
interframe space), DIFS(DCF interframe space) and EIFS(extended interframe space), are defined to 
provide priority levels for access to the media. SIFS is used to send control packets, and has the highest 
priority for access to the media; PIFS is used only by access points operating under PCF; DIFS is used 
by access points or stations for DCF, and EIFS is used only when an error occurs in frame transmission. 
Following this IFS medium idle time, the station then generates a random backoff period for an additional 
deferment time before transmitting. The backoff time is defined as 
 
Backoff Time = Random( ) × aSlotTime. 
 
In this equation, Random( ) is a pseudorandom integer drawn from a uniform distribution over the 
interval [0, CW]; aSlotTime is the value of the correspondingly named PHY characteristic, and CW is an 
integer within the range of values of the PHY characteristics aCWmin and aCWmax, i.e., aCWmin ≤ CW 
≤ aCWmax. aCWmin and aCWmax have different values in each 802.11 PHY. Table 1 [4-6] lists three 
802.11 PHY characteristics.

4.2 E-BSIM Mechanism 
In BSIM, a WLAN packet whose frequency overlaps with Bluetooth SCO packet is postponed, possibly 
degrading the WLAN performance. Fortunately, IEEE 802.15.2 and Bluetooth specification version 1.2 
both define a new SCO packet type, called an EV-type packet [3]. By classifying Bluetooth slots as “good” 
or “bad”, an EV-type packet is not transmitted during the two “bad” hops, but waits for the next pair of 
slots, which happens to be a “good” channel. Figure 4 compares HV3 and EV3 packets, in which a WLAN 
interferes with the hopping frequencies of the first, second and fifth slots. The bad channels degrade the 
HV3 link voice quality, but an EV3 link can maintain a good voice quality of voice by transmitting only via 
good slots.

Fig. 6. SCO link throughput under WLAN’s interference 
 
The second simulation studied how the Bluetooth SCO link affects the WLAN throughput. This 
simulation environment contained one Bluetooth voice link and two 802.11b stations, both of which were 
connected to a CBR traffic load. The simulation was performed 30 seconds, and the WLAN throughput 
was measured every second. Figure 7 indicates that HV3 packet and BSIM have a similar impact on the 
802.11b WLAN. However, BSIM and HV3 packet causes intermittent WLAN throughput, since the WLAN 
postpones transmission when packet collides with Bluetooth. Notably, E-BSIM successfully mitigates 
packet collision between Bluetooth and WLAN by using the characteristics of EV3 packets.
