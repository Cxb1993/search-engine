Abstract 
Based on the correlations existing between 
the temporal images and in the spatial image, 
the project proposes a side-match algorithm 
(SMA) to estimate the position of optimally 
estimated block of the current block in the 
reconstructed images. SMA exploits the 
reconstructed region near the current block to 
search the most similar region to it so that the 
probable location of estimated block of the 
current block can be found. Because SMA can 
be synchronously operated in two ends, 
encoder and decoder, when SMA can obtain 
better estimated block of the current block than 
full search, only one flag bit instead of the bits 
for reference frame and motion vector is 
needed to express whether SMA is used or not. 
The experimental results indicate that SMA can 
get better PSNR than full search under the 
condition of having approximate compression 
ratio. 
 
Key words: correlation, reconstructed images, 
full search, PSNR, H.264 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Since the contiguous images in nature have 
the correlation between them, which means that 
there are many similar contents between them. 
This characteristic can greatly reduce 
transmitted data by means of motion estimation 
and compensation which is a technique to 
estimate the current block and uses the 
estimated block in place of the current block to 
reconstruct image for reducing data 
transmitted. 
The concept of motion estimation and 
compensation is first proposed by Netravali and 
Robbins in 1979. Due to the techniques, the 
amounts of data can be greatly compressed in 
store space and in the transmission. Hence, the 
newest standard of video compression still uses 
the technique to compress images. 
Up to this time, the methods of motion 
estimation can be divided as four categories: 
a. Block-based motion estimation: the 
algorithms based on it are called block 
matching algorithm (BMA)[1]-[7]. 
With the BMA, an image is divided 
into many small rectangle blocks in 
which every pixels have same moving 
in the translating direction. Because of 
simple and high efficient, many 
international standards for image 
compression still adopt the technique. 
b. Pixel-based motion estimation: the 
algorithms based on it are called 
optical flow algorithm (OFA) or 
pel-recursive algorithm (PRA)[6][7]. 
Because the algorithms need a great of 
computations and complex analysis, 
they are not adequate for real-time 
video compression. 
c. Region-based motion estimation: the 
algorithms based on it are called 
region contour-based algorithm 
(RCBA)[8]-[10]. With the RCBA, an 
image will be divided into several 
regions, and then each region performs 
motion estimation individually. Since 
the shape of the regions may be any 
shape, the motion estimation becomes 
rather complex and needs a lot of 
computations. 
d. Mesh-based motion estimation: the 
algorithms based on it are called 
spatial transform algorithm [11]-[12]. 
Using the methods, an image will be

information is a drawback of the two 
techniques. The project proposes side-match 
algorithm (SMA) to find optimally estimated 
block in the search window for reducing bits of 
motion vector and reference frames. SMA 
utilizes the region adjacent left and up edges of 
current block which have been reconstructed by 
both transmitter (encoder) and receiver 
(decoder). Because both transmitter and 
receiver have same reconstructed images, the 
operation of SMA can be perform 
synchronously and both sides can obtain same 
results. Only one flag bit are needed to express 
if the result of SMA is adopted. 
SMA will be stated in Section II. In Section 
III experimental results is presented. In Section 
IV some suggestions to SMA are proposed. 
Finally, a conclusion is made. 
II. A NEW MOTION ESTIMATION SCHEME 
The new algorithm, SMA, is mainly based 
on the correlation between contiguous images 
and in the spatial image. SMA is different from 
some algorithms using the current block to 
search a block the most similar to it in motion 
estimation, instead of using the current block it 
uses the region that is adjacent left and up 
edges of current block, which has been 
reconstructed by both transmitter and receiver, 
to estimate the position of the block the most 
similar to current block. For clarity, the section 
will be divided into two parts, side-match 
searching and side-match algorithm. 
2.1 The side-match searching 
An image sequence is showed in Figure 1. It 
includes the current image and some 
reconstructed images. In the current image, 
some blocks have been reconstructed, some 
blocks not yet being encoded and a current 
block in the coding proceeding. In Figure 2, the 
region adjacent to the edge of current block is 
drawn, which belongs to reconstructed region. 
For convenience, we call the region as side 
region. Based on the correlation of images, we 
use the side region to find the most matching 
region with it in several reconstructed frames. 
When the best matching of side region is found, 
a block showed as Figure 3 is considered as 
optimal block for estimating the current block. 
The block will be compared with one found by 
full search. The comparison will obtain three 
possible results as follows: 
a. The block found by side match is 
worse than one by full search. The 
cause may be that the correlation 
between side region and current 
block is not strong. 
b. The block found by side match has 
the same the amount of error as one 
by full search. 
c. The block found by side match is 
better than one by full search. The 
cause is that the block is from the 
reconstructed region of current 
image that doesn’t belong to the 
range of search window of full 
search. 
 
Fig. 1. Image sequence. 
For high quality of the reconstructed images, 
the proposed project will do both side-match 
search and full search, and select the best block 
as the estimation of the current block. One flag 
bit is needed to distinguish which searching 
method is adopted and is defined as: 
Current image 
Reconstructed 
images

：Current block

10. Compute the error (Ekj_sma) between the 
subblock found by side-match search and 
the corresponding current subblock. 
11. If Ekj_sma > TH2, a threshold, we directly 
adopt the subblock found by full search as 
the best matching subblock with the 
corresponding current subblock, and the 
bits for reference frame and motion vector 
be sent, not including flag bit. 
12. If Ekj_sma  TH≤ 2, we compare two errors, 
Ekj_sma and Ekj_ful from full search If 
Ekj_sma  E≤ kj_ful, only one flag bit (=0) is 
sent, otherwise, one flag bit (=1) and the 
bits for reference frame and motion vector 
are sent. 
13. If four subblocks with size 4×4 is finished, 
next subblock with 8×8 will be processed. 
If four subblocks with 8×8 are finished, go 
back to step 1. 
For full search, it needs not to transmit flag 
bit, but search window do not include the 
current image. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The system to implement the new motion 
estimation is based on H.263, but in coding part 
of motion vector we need slight modification as 
the algorithm in Section II. Cosine transform of 
the system is also modified as 4×4 integer 
transform. The conditions of running the 
system are assigned as follows: 
1. Image sequence is IPP… 
2. Image size is QCIF. 
3. Reference frame is 4. 
4. TH1 = 256. 
5. TH2 = 200. 
With frame rate equal to 30 and 
approximately compressed file, Table 1 shows 
that our scheme has the better average PSNR 
about 0.3 dB than full search. Changing frame 
rate to 15, the new method also has better 
average PSNR about 0.21 dB than full search in 
Table 2. Frame rate can reflect the strong or 
weak of the correlation between images. The 
higher frame rate, the bigger the correlation 
exist between images. Specially, the new 
algorithm to process the image sequence, 
mother-daughter, can get PSNR above 0.5 dB 
in different frame rate.

IV. SUGGESTION 
In H264/AVC, there is one of modes which a 
macroblock is divided into subblocks with size 
4×4. When the mode is selected, getting more 
accurate estimation is its advantage, but 
sending more bits for reference frame and 
motion vector is its drawback. This is a 
dilemma. From our research, the time of 
selecting the mode is when having larger 
bandwidth. Of course, if the new algorithm can 
be used in the mode, the coding of the system 
will be efficiently promoted.

由於自然界中許多的連續影像(Images)彼此間存在著極大的相
關性(Correlation)，也就是說連續影像間的畫面(Frame)存在著有許
多相似的地方，這個特性使得在傳輸影像的過程中，可利用傳輸過
的重建影像來代表目前要傳輸的影像，以大量減少資料的傳送，進
而增加影像的壓縮率，至於如何精確的在重建影像中找到最相似於
目前要傳輸影像的部份，這就是運動估測(Motion Estimation: ME)
所要做的事。 
目前由於計算機的處理速度愈來愈快，新發佈的H.264/AVC
中，提出了許多與運動預估有關的技術，這些技術有的需要大量的
記憶體，有的需要大量的計算，但在編碼效率及影像重建品質的優
先考量下，所增加的記憶體及計算量已不再視為重要缺點，其相關
技術內容概有：  
a. 可變區塊大小的運動估測與補償(Variable Block-Size Motion 
Compensation with Small Block Size) 
b. 四 分 之 一 像 素 精 確 度 的 運 動 估 測 與 補 償
(Quarter-Sample-Accurate Motion Compensation) 
c. 超越畫面之運動向量(Motion Vectors over Picture Boundary). 
d. 多參考畫面的運動估測與補償(Multiple Reference Picture 
Motion Compensation) 
e. 加權預估(Weighted Prediction)

事實上在處理視訊影像的過程中，最難的部份就是影像中有影
像物件的激烈移動、轉動、出現或消失等，這會造成連續畫面間有
太大的差異性，也就是說影像畫面間的相關性會變小，使得運動估
測找到的最佳預估影像也會與目前影像相去太遠，雖然在
