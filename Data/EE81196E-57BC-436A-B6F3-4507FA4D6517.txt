1 Introduction
The main purpose of the two-year porject is to study the interaction of a vibrating micro structure with a
thin rarefied gas film. We try to employ numerical and experimental approaches to investigate the complex
phenomena of rarefied gas motions due to a vibrating micro structure. Since the Knudsen number Kn of
the rarefied gas flow is greater than 0.1, the modified Reynolds lubrication equation can not be used for
the flow simulation. A Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) model is proposed in the project. We have
established a DSMC model in the first year. The Hagen Poiseuille pipe flow is utilized to validate the DSMC
model. Meanwhile, we have fabricated a micro structure using the MEMS technique. The micro device will
be used to perform experiments in the second year. More details of results in the first year can be found in
the following section.
2 DSMC Model
To simulate the rarefied gas motions in the micro device, a DSMC model which was proposed by Bird (1994)
has been established for simulations of the thin rarefied gas film. In order to validate the DSMC model,
the Hagen Poseiuille flow is considered. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the studied Hagen Poseiuille flow.
A 2-D micro channel of height 200 µm and length 2,400 µm is adopted in the simulation. Nitrogen is the
working fluid in the micro channel. The mass and diameter of a singular nitrogen moleucle are 4.65 × 10−26
kg and 4.17 × 10−10 m. Since it is a pressure driven flow, the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet
boundaries is set as 22 Pa to drive the gas flow inside the micro channel. The absolute pressure at the inlet
boundary is 310 Pa. The initial pressure P0 and temperature T0 inside the channel are 300 Pa and 300 K,
respectively. In addition, the number density n, mean free path λ0 and theoretical dynamic viscosity µ at
the inlet boundary can be determined:

The Knudsen number Kn, λ/H , is 0.087. Essentially, slip phenomena is expected in the vicinity of solid
walls. 396,000 molecules are placed inside the channel at the begin. 400×33 cells are employed to divide

from the decaying rate of the damped oscillation of the structure under consideration. Unfortunately, the
damping of the vibration system may come from the structural damping in addition to the fluid-structure
interaction. According to the literature available, it is reported that single-crystal-silicon (SCS) microstruc-
tures exhibit negligible structural damping. Consequently, we choose to fabricate the microstructures on the
top layer of an SOI wafer. Ten SOI wafers with 0.5µm-thick device layer and 2 µm-thick box oxide were
purchased. Facing the tremendous works to be done in this project, the experimental part of this project is
divided into two stages. The purposes of microfabrication at the current stage are
1. to assess the feasibility of the microfabrication processes,
2. to evaluate the stability of the microstuctures resonating at high frequency, and
3. to test the position sensing via capacitance measurement.
We briefly describe the works that have been achieved in the followings:
Assess the feasibility of the microfabrication processes
DSMC is a particle-based method of physical modeling and it is particularly suitable for the simulation of
the gas flows with large mean velocity under a rarefied condition. These requirements pose serious challenges
on the design and microfabrication of the microstructures. In the design part, the microstructure has to
oscillate at a very high frequency in order to obtain a large mean velocity. This requires a vibration system
with a low proof mass and stiff supprting structures. This justifies the necessity of microstructures. On the
other hand, such a system requires a strong actuation to drive the stiff microstructure. Electrstatic actuation
is perfect for the actuation in the microscale. However, its application is limited by the electric breakdown
due to arc and the pull-in phenomenon associated with the nonlinear stability problem.
Currently, the development of DSMC is still in preliminary stage and is not able to provide sufficient in-
formation regarding the design of microstructures such as the natural frequency, the size, and the rarefaction
of gas. We can only try to design the static experiment to test the capability of microstructures. To avoid
the possible electric breakdown and pull-in, the voltage for electric actuation is determined to be less than
110V. With this limitation, the stiffness of the microstructure can be determined. In order to achieve a large
mean velocity in the gas chamber, the natural frequency is the larger the better. Under these conditions
and based upon some simple calculation, 4 different microsturctures with natural frequencies ranging from
20 to 70kHz are designed and fabricated using microfbarication processes with two masks. See Figure 6 and
7. The microfabrication processes are briefly described as follows:
1. Photolithography with mask #1 using AZ-4620 positive photoresist.
2. Reactive ion etching to remove the 0.5 µm top silicon.
3. Reactive ion etching to remove the 2 µm box oxide.
4. Photolithography with mask #2 using AZ-4620 positive photoresist.
5. E-beam thermal evaporation to deposit Titanium as adhesion layer and then deposit Gold as metal-
lization layer.
6. Lift-off process to remove unwanted metal.
7. Release the microstructures in HF acid.
The micrographs of the fabricated microstructures are shown in Figure 8. To assess the quality of the
microfabrication processes, the fabricated microstructures are put under the profiler to measure the roughness
of the surface. The measurement indicated that the surface is pretty smooth as shown in Figure 9.

ABSTRACT 
Flow patterns and variations of pollutant concentration 
induced by a jet coming from a vertical round tube in a 
cross flow are numerically simulated in this study.  
Various flow patterns with respect to the momentum ratio 
R of jet to cross wind are investigated.  There are four 
characteristic modes in the predicted flows, i.e. 
downwash, crossflow-dominated, transition, and jet-
dominated modes.  Pollutants are transported to the 
vicinity of the tube, when the momentum of the jet is far 
less than the cross flow.  Effective discharges of 
pollutants are found in the jet-dominated mode in which 
the momentum of the jet should be sufficiently large. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Evolution of a jet in a cross flow is a common 
phenomenon in industry.  For example, film cooling in a 
turbine blade is a method which employs jets coming 
from holes on a blade surface to cool the blade.  To 
dilute pollutants, a chimney is used to discharge 
pollutants in a cross flow.   Due to its excellent diffusivity, 
a jet in a cross flow has been applied to several mass 
and heat transfer areas.  In the past study, a jet coming 
from a wall surface was studied and appeared in plenty 
of literatures (see Ramsey & Goldstein, 1971, Kamotani 
& Gerber, 1972, Fearn & Weston, 1974, Andrepoulos & 
Rodi, 1984, Kelso et al., 1996).   However, some of jets 
are discharged from tubes or chimneys in most of 
applications.  It is well known that von Kármán vortex 
street is formed behind a tube or a chimney in a cross 
flow.  The influence of the vortex street should be 
included in a jet coming from a tube in a cross flow.  The 
interaction of a jet with a vortex street and a cross flow 
becomes very complicated.   Several manuscripts have 
considered a tube jet in a cross flow (Eiff et al., 1995, 
Huang & Hsieh, 2003, Huang & Lan, 2005).   Most of 
them performed experiments in a wind tunnel to observe 
an elevated jet in a cross stream.  In addition, Huang & 
Lan (2005) presented vortex motion in the shear layer of 
the edge of a jet.   They also clearly demonstrated 
harmonics of those vortex motions using FFT technique. 
 
 Fig. 1 shows he schematic of a tube jet in a cross 
flow.  A uniform flow at the speed uw is perpendicular to a 
circular tube of diameter d.   A jet at uj comes from the 
bottom of the tube.  The momentum ratio R is denoted as 
uj
2/uw2.  The tube is longer than 12d, but the bottom of 
the computational domain to the exit of the tube is 12d.   
Variations of the flow field with respect to R and 
Reynolds number Rew = uwd/ν are studied using a 
numerical approach in the following sections.   
Furthermore, the concentration profiles of pollutants 
coming from a jet are provided, since it is hard to obtain 
concentration fields using experimental approaches.  
Those may be useful for engineers to design a method to 
discharge pollutants or to prevent pollutants 
accumulation in a densely populated region.

MATHEMATICAL FORMULAE AND NUMERICAL 
APPROACHES 
An incompressible fluid is adopted in this study.  The final 
steady flow fields are considered, since those fields are 
useful for engineering applications.  Mass and 
momentum conservation should be conserved and 
denoted as  
continuity equation 
0u =⋅∇  , (1) 
and Navier-Stokes equations, 
( ) ( )u1uu ∇⋅∇+∇−=⋅∇ ν
ρ
P
 , (2) 
where u is the velocity vector, P is pressure and ν is the 
kinematic viscosity of a working fluid.  Furthermore,  the 
mass transfer equation was employed to obtain the 
concentration distribution of pollutants and revealed as 
( ) ( )CDC m∇⋅∇=⋅∇ u , (3) 
where C is a concentration variable and Dm is the 
molecular diffusion coefficient.  SF6 is utilized as the 
pollutant tracer, so Dm is set as 3.0×10-5 m2s-1.   
Although densities of air and SF6 are different, the 
gravitational effect is not considered in this study.  The 
density of air, 1.204 kgm-3 at 20 oC, is applied to ρ.    
 
 The governing equations were solved by the finite 
volume method.  A commercial package STAR-CDTM is 
employed to perform the simulation.  A three-dimensional 
mesh is employed.  Fig. 2 shows the mesh at the 
horizontal plane.   The computational domain is 
21dx12dx28d at the x-, y-, and z-directions, respectively.  
The original point is at the center of the exit of the tube 
and the x-axis is the cross flow direction.  Computational 
cells are densely clustered in the vicinity of the tube.  
336,000 computational cells are used in the three-
dimensional mesh.  The convection term in Eq. (2) is 
solved by the 3-rd order QUICK scheme and SIMPLE is 
used to solve velocity and pressure fields iteratively.  The 
maximum mass residual should be less than 10-4 for 
each case.  The established numerical mode was 
performed at a PC cluster consisting of 16 AMD XP2800 
CPUs.   It takes about two and half months for each case.

 Figs. 8 and 9 reveal the streamline plot and 
concentration contour of a flow field at R = 0.95.  The 
momentum of the jet is almost equal to the cross flow.  It 
can found that the deflection angle of the jet is larger 
than the downwash mode.  The vortex behind the jet 
grows.  Let us check the concentration profile in Fig. 8.  It 
is found that the contour line referring to 10-4 is higher 
than one in the downwash mode.  However, it is still 
below the exit of the tube.  Since the cross flow still 
deflects the jet, this is the so-called cross flow dominated 
region. 
 
 As the jet is speeded up and faster than the cross 
flow, R increases and the flow fields become the 
transition mode.  Figs. 10 and 11 show the streamline 
plots and concentration contour of the flow fields at R = 
2.02.   It can found that the contour line referring to 10-4 is 
closed to the exit of the tube.  Fig, 12 reveals the 
concentration contours behind the tube.  The downwash 
phenomenon of pollutants almost disappears in this 
mode.  However, the CVP structure is still not obvious in 
this mode. 
 
 Figs. 13 and 14 present the streamline plot and 
concentration of a jet dominated flow field at R = 9.37.  It 
is clear that the jet is slightly deflected by the cross flow.  
The vortex behind the jet disappears.  It means that the 
interaction of the jet with the wake behind the tube 
becomes weak.   The specified contour line referring to 
10-4 is at almost the same level of the exit of the tube in 
Fig. 14.  It turns out that pollutants are transported 
downstream and not remained in the vicinity of the tube.   
Meanwhile, due to the appearance of the CVP structure 
in the cross section of the jet, the entrainment effect of 
the jet is enhanced and, as a result, the pollutants are 
diluted by ambient fluids along the cross flow direction (see Fig. 15).

Deflection angle of the jet 
 Since the deflection angle θj between the jet and the 
z-axis can be regarded as an index of the interaction of 
the jet with the cross flow and the wake, Fig. 16 shows 
the variation of θj with respect to R.   Obviously, θj is 
inversely proportional to R.  It means that the influences 
of the cross flow and the wake on the jet become weak 
when R increases.   
 
 Variation of concentration at a ground point 
 Other important information is the variation of 
concentration with respect to R, since it is relevant to 
pollutant discharge using a jet.  A point located at 14d 
behind the tube is chosen to observe the variation of 
concentration with respect to R.  It can be found that the 
concentration C is higher than 1 ppm in the downwash 
and crossflow-dominated modes in Figure 17.  C 
decreases rapidly once the flow fields are at the 
transition or jet-dominated mode.  It means that the 
operation of pollutant discharge using a jet in a cross flow 
should be in the transition or jet-dominated modes.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Variations of a round tube jet in a cross flow are 
investigated using a numerical approach in this study.  A 
hovering vortex is found near the exit of the tube when 
the flow is at R less than 0.43.  It means that the 
interaction of the jet with the cross flow happens in the 
inside of the tube.   Four flow modes, downwash, 
crossflow-dominated, transition, and jet-dominated 
modes, are demonstrated according to features of flow 
patterns and concentration contours.  It is found that the 
counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) appears in the jet-
dominated mode.  In terms of the concentration profiles, 
it turns out that discharges of pollutants from a jet should 
be operated in the transition or jet-dominated mode. 
 
 Although the numerical model provides a first picture 
of this problem, the model is still being modified.  In the 
future work, unsteady fluid motion will be considered to 
observe the transient behaviors of a tube jet in a cross 
flow.  Meanwhile, a large eddy simulation (LES) 
technique will be included to obtain more detailed vortex 
motions in the edge of the jet, which were mentioned by 
Huang and Lan (2005).
