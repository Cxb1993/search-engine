3ABSTRACT: Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is known to be immiscible
with poly(styrene) (PS) in the bulk state. Poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA),
poly(propyl methacrylate) (PPMA) and poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) are also
known to be immiscible with PMMA ( or PS). Therefore, PMAs(PMMA, PEMA,
PPMA and PBMA) are predicted by the mean field theory to be immiscible with
poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) in the bulk state. However, the
miscibility of PMAs with PS-b-PMMA may be different in the two dimensional state.
Therefore the mixed monolayer behavior of PMAs and PS-b-PMMA was investigated
from the measurements of surface pressure-area per molecule (π-A) isotherms at three
different temperatures( 10℃, 25℃ and 40℃). Calculation of compressibility from
isotherms provided the inflection data from maximum and minimum peaks. The
miscibility and nonideality of the mixed monolayers were examined by calculating
the excess area as a function of composition. Mostly negative deviations from
ideality were observed in the mixed monolayers. This is likely because of favorable
interaction between PMMA and PMAs in the monolayer state. The positive
deviations occurred at 40℃ with PBMA at a high surface pressure. Therefore with
confinement in the two dimensional state, the miscibility between PMAs and
PS-b-PMMA was greatly improved in comparison with the bulk state.
Key words : PMAs; PS-b-PMMA; monolayer
5the air/water interface, therefore it is not easy to determine good pairs to compare the
miscibility in the bulk state with that in a film spread at the air/water interface.
Recently, Morioka12 published an article of surface dilatational moduli of
poly( vinyl acetate )(PVAc) and PVAc-poly( n-hexyl isocyanate )(PHIC) blend films
at the air/water interface. PVAc formed a film that was looser and also more stable
against strain than the PHIC film. The apparent surface dilatational modulus and
surface pressure of the blend films were superimposed on the lower concentration of
PVAc, irrespective of the composition of PVAc. The stereocomplex formation
between isotactic and syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) ( it-PMMA, st-PMMA )
in a Langmuir monolayer investigated by surface pressure-area isotherms and atomic
force microscopy( AFM ) was reported by Aiba et al.13. Their results indicated that
the stereocomplex formation was highly sensitive to the compression rate of the
monolayer. Other current references include the molecularly detailed modeling of
surface pressure isotherms of poly-L-lactic acid, poly(dimethylsiloxane), PMMA and
poly(isobutylene)14 at the air/water interface.
There were few studies concerning monolayers of
polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate).15-16 Langmuir film balance
experiments and atomic force microscopy showed that the diblock copolymer
molecules formed surface micelles. In the plot of the surface pressure versus
surface area per repeating unit, the monolayer changed from the gas phase to the
liquid expanded phase at lower surface pressure for systems at low temperature
compared to those at high temperature. In addition, a plateau, corresponding to
the transition from the liquid expanded to liquid condensed phase, appeared at
lower surface pressure for systems with a higher subphase temperature.
PMMA was reported to show favorable interaction with poly(propyl
methacrylate) (PPMA) at 25℃10 and poly(n–butyl methacrylate)(PBMA)17 at the
water/air interface at 25-27℃ because of the observations of negative excess
surface area. The strong cohesion between the main chains of PMMA and
PBMA may cause the n-butyl side chains to assume the vertical orientation in
the mixed monolayer when the mixed monolayer is rich in PMMA, almost all
the n-butyl side chains assume the vertical orientation even at the lowest surface
7EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
PMMA was purchased from Scientific Polymer Products, Inc.. According to the
supplier information, the molecular weight ( Mw ) of PMMA is about 100,000 g/mol.
The molecular weight (Mw ) of PEMA obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.
is 340,000 g/mol. PPMA and PBMA were also purchased from Scientific Polymer
Products, Inc. with the molecular weight ( Mw ) of 250,000 and 181,000 g/mol,
respectively. The reported glass transition temperatures of PMMA, PEMA, PPMA
and PBMA were about 103℃, 63℃, 48℃ and 15℃, respectively. PS-b-PMMA
from Polymer Source, Inc. had a molecular weight( Mn ) of 10,000 and 10,000 for the
PS block and the PMMA block, respectively.
2-butanone purchased from Tedia Company Inc. was used as the spreading
solvent for the polymer films. The solvent was chosen to be the same as a previous
study18. 2-butanone does not dissolve in water and is volatile. Only highly pure
water, which was purified by means of a Milli-Q plus water purification system, with
a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ-cm was used in all experiments. Blank experiments using
2-butanone were carried out that there were no surface-active impurities.
Surface Pressure Measurements
A model minitrough ( M 1200 ) was purchased from KSV Instruments Ltd., Finland.
The Teflon trough was 320 mm long and 75 mm wide. Regulation of the trough
temperature was controlled by circulating constant temperature water from an external
9polymer and solvent was set at 0.5 mg/mL. A 50μL sample containing 
monolayer-forming polymeric materials was spread on the subphase by using a
Hamilton microsyringe to make the deposition of polymer molecules at almost the
same condition. At least 30-45 min was allowed for evaporation of the spreading
solvent. After the solvent was evaporated, the monolayer was compressed
continuously at a rate of 3.5 mm/min to obtain a single π-A isotherm.  The π-A
isotherms of our studied polymers are dependent on the compression rate therefore the
results were performed at the same compression speed.
11
There is also a correspondence of the minimum compressibility value (20-25 mN/m)
( as shown in Figure 2(b) ) to the plateau for PEMA in Figure 2(a).
PEMA/PS-b-PMMA(3/1) exhibited a even lower compressibility than PEMA for
most surface pressure regions in Figure 2(b). The isotherms of
PPMA/PS-b-PMMA monolayers ( in Figure 3(a) ) are similar to mixed PMMA
monolayers. The majority of isotherms is located in between those of PPMA and
PS-b-PMMA except that the isotherms of PPMA/PS-b-PMMA(1/3) are very close to
PS-b-PMMA. For the PBMA/PS-b-PMMA monolayers described in Figure 4(a),
the isotherms are in between those of component polymers at the low surface pressure
regions. For PPMA and PBMA in Figures 3(b) and 4(b), there are minimum
compressibility values(ca. 20mN/m and 15mN/m) to theπ-A isotherm plateau in
Figures 3(a) and 4(a). Addition of PS-b-PMMA into PEMA ( or PPMA or PBMA )
also increased its compressibility for most surface pressure regions as shown in Figure
2(b) ( or 3(b) or 4(b)).
The π-A isotherms of monolayers and compressibility for PMMA and
PS-b-PMMA at 25℃ are shown in Figure 5(a). The results of PEMA, PPMA and
PBMA mixed monolayers are omitted for brevity. PS-b-PMMA still exhibited the
highest compressibility among the studied pure polymers. Different from those at
10℃, PMMA demonstrated a slightly higher compressibility than PEMA and PPMA.
PBMA still had the lowest compressibility. The compressibility of PBMA decreased
drastically from 10℃ to 25℃ likely because of crossing the glass transition
temperature region. For the PMMA/PS-b-PMMA monolayers at 25℃ illustrated in
Figure 5(a), the isotherms exhibited higher surface pressures than both component
polymers at surface pressure larger than ca. 20 mN/m. The compressibility of
PMMA/PS-b-PMMA(3/1 and 1/3) in Figure 5(b) is larger than the average value at
13
40℃( ca. 10 mN/m and 12.5-15 mN/m ) different from one minimum observed at
10℃. It is likely the longer alkyl chain of PMAs, the monolayer exhibits more
liquid like behavior.
The lift-off points( the point at which the gas phase intersects with the liquid
expanded phase), inflection points, solid limiting areas and collapse pressure of PMAs
and PS-b-PMMA were calculated and tabulated in Table I. The lift-off points of the
polymers have the following rank: PBMA＞PPMA＞PEMA＞PMMA＞
PS-b-PMMA.
In Table I, the lift-off area of PS-b-PMMA is smaller than PMMA likely because of
the condensed nature of PS. For PMAs, the lift-off areas seemed to increase with
increasing side-chain carbon number. Increasing temperature causes most of the
lift-off areas of PEMA, PPMA and PBMA to increase. However, slightly decrease
of the lift-off areas was observed in PMMA and PS-b-PMMA. The inflection point
of PS-b-PMMA at 10℃ was not detected likely because of condensed PS
segments( designated as ND in Table I ) therefore not reported. PMMA, PEMA,
PPMA and PBMA all demonstrated two inflection pressures at 10℃. The low
inflection pressures probably are attributed to the liquid expanded state. The high
inflection pressures ( corresponding to the minimum and plateau in Figures 1 to 9 )
are likely because of liquid expanded to liquid condensed transition or liquid
expanded to another liquid expanded transition19. For PPMA at 40℃ and PBMA
at 25 and 40℃, there are three inflection pressures detected because of previous
observations of two minimum compressibility values. The temperature elevation
effect brought a decrease in the inflection pressures of PMAs except PEMA. For
PEMA, the inflection pressures were unexpected to be almost temperature
15
a given surface pressure, the excess area is defined as the difference between the
average area per molecule of a mixed monolayer consisting of components 1 and 2
and that of an ideal mixed monolayer1.
Aex = A12–Aideal = A12–( X1A1 + X2A2 ) (1)
where A12 and Aideal are the mean and ideal areas per molecule of the mixed
monolayer at a given surface pressure, respectively, X1 and X2 imply the mole
fractions of components 1 and 2, respectively, and A1 and A2 are the areas per
molecule of each pure monolayer at the same surface pressure. Based on eq.(1), the
Aex values of mixed PMAs/PS-b-PMMA monolayers can be estimated from the data
shown in Figures 1-9, individually.
In Figures 10(a)-(d), 11 and 12(a)-(d) the normalized quantities, Aex/Aideal are
shown as a function of PS-b-PMMA mole fraction and surface pressure at 10℃, 25℃
and 40℃, respectively. For Figure 10(a)-(d) the Aex/Aideal values are all close to zero
or negative at 10℃. Negative excess area deviation shows favorable interaction
between PMAs and PS-b-PMMA. Surface pressure difference causes a minor
change in the excess area. The Aex/Aideal values at 25℃ for PEMA ( or PPMA
or PBMA ) and PS-b-PMMA ( not shown ) are close to or smaller than zero and also
indicate favorable interaction between PEMA ( or PPMA or PBMA ) and
PS-b-PMMA. For the PMMA/PS-b-PMMA mixed monolayers described in Figure
11, the Aex/Aideal values are positive when the weight ratio between PMMA and
PS-b-PMMA is 1 to 1. The reason is likely because of self-aggregation of
PS-b-PMMA prompted by the addition of PMMA. The self-aggregation ( in
particular surface micelle formation ) was reported in references 15 and 16. The
slight surface pressure effect on the excess surface area was detected in mixed
17
cause favorable interaction between PMAs and PS-b-PMMA on the basis of our study
as shown in negative excess area estimation.
