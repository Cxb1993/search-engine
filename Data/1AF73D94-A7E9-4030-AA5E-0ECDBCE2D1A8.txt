1. Abstract  
A new device with microwave irradiation 
has been developed to trigger hydrogen 
generation from a water gas shift reaction 
(WGSR) in this study. In the experiments, the 
effect of a high-temperature catalyst on the 
WGSR is investigated. The results indicate 
that the increase of hydrogen generation 
tends to slow down once the gas hourly space 
velocity (GHSV) decreases and approaches 
28000 hr-1. When the steam/CO ratio is low, 
for example, steam/CO=1, a concave up 
curve of CO concentration, characterized by 
conventional heating methods, is not 
observed a microwave irradiation 
environment. This comparison shows that the 
performance of the WGSR with microwave 
irradiation is better. It is noted, however, that 
cracks may occur on the catalyst surface as a 
result of less water to relieve the high thermal 
gradient, stemming from the microwave 
radiation on the catalyst bed. With an 
increase in the reaction temperature or 
steam/CO ratio, a smoother increase in CO 
conversion is observed, as opposed to those 
observed in conventional heating methods. 
This is attributed to the fact that the energy 
absorption by steam and the catalyst is more 
efficient under the effects of microwave 
radiation. As a whole, this study shows that 
the microwave reactor heats faster, provides 
more efficient energy transfer to reactants 
and minimizes the space needed to achieve 
the desired results.

3.2 Microwave reactor 
The key unit of the reaction system is 
the microwave reactor. In the reactor, the 
main components consist of a reaction tube, a 
K-type thermocouple, a mixing layer and a 
catalyst bed. These components are installed 
in a chamber, which contains a magnetron to 
produce microwaves. The microwave 
frequency was fixed at 2.45 GHz and the 
maximum power of the microwave source 
was 800W. Hence, when a WGSR was 
performed, the aforementioned components 
were exposed to an environment with 
microwave radiation. In a previous study 
with conventional heating [6], a preheater 
was used to preheat the mixture of water and 
CO and to make the reagents mix uniformly. 
This aided in carrying out the WGSR in the 
subsequent reactor. Instead, in the conducted 
microwave reactor, the preheating and 
reaction processes were integrated by 
combining the mixing layer and the catalyst 
bed, in series, in the reaction tube. The 
mixing layer was a packed bed filled with 
glass balls (3mm). These balls provided a 
space for water residence and for facilitating 
the dissipation of water in the tube. It is 
known that water pertains to one of the 
dielectrics, which can be heated by 
microwaves rapidly. Therefore, water was 
transformed into steam in the mixing layer 
and a mixture of CO and steam was formed 
therein. This enabled us to decrease the size 
of the preheating unit in the microwave 
reactor, greatly reducing the experimental 
space needed. Following the mixing layer, 
the WGSR was triggered in the catalyst bed 
under the effects of microwave irradiation. 
Another design that should be mentioned in 
the microwave reactor is that the 
thermocouple was inserted in the catalyst bed 
rather than mounted outside the reaction tube 
as it had been previously [6]. The 
thermocouple was shielded by an alumina 
tube to prevent microwaves from being 
absorbed by any metallic part of the 
thermocouple [12]. This eliminated the 
interference in electrical signal due to 
microwaves in the thermocouple. Seeing that 
the measured temperature in the catalyst bed

residence time of 0.1286 sec) is selected as 
the basis condition for hydrogen generation 
in this study. On the other hand, when 
examining the distributions of H2 and CO2 
concentrations shown in Fig. 2a, it is worthy 
of note that the concentration of H2 is always 
slightly higher than that of CO2. In a previous 
study with conventional heating [13], it has 
been verified that the extra hydrogen 
generated was due to the thermal 
decomposition of steam under the effects of 
the catalyst and the high-temperature 
environment. Apparently, the thermal 
decomposition of steam is also exhibited 
when microwaves are used for the WGSR. 
4.2. Comparison of WGSR 
To figure out the characteristic of the 
WGSR along with microwave excitation, the 
concentration distributions of CO, CO2 and 
H2 under the effects of conventional heating 
and microwave heating are demonstrated in 
Fig. 3a and 3b, respectively. In these two 
figures, the steam/CO ratio is 1 and the 
concentration of CO in the feed gas will 
increase if the reaction temperature rises. It 
should be mentioned that, because of the 
difference in designs between the two heating 
methods, as described in the experimental 
method, only a qualitative comparison is 
carried out.  
In Fig. 3a (GHSV=36000 hr-1), a 
concave up curve in the distribution of CO 
concentration is exhibited. It has been 
illustrated [6] that this is a result of CO 
depletion with increasing temperature being 
insufficient to counteract the increase of CO 
concentration in the feed gas. In contrast, for 
hydrogen generation with microwave 
irradiation (GHSV=28000 hr-1), Fig. 3b 
depicts that the concave up curve of the CO 
concentration disappears.

Unlike the behavior obtained in Fig. 3a, 
even though the CO concentration in the feed 
gas is enlarged with increasing reaction 
temperature, the reaction of CO along with 
microwave heating is still promoted. This 
reveals that the performance of the WGSR 
with microwave irradiation is superior to that 
of conventional heating. This arises from that 
microwaves can be efficiently absorbed by 
both water and the catalyst, as illustrated 
previously. Accordingly, it is summarized

4.4. SEM observation 
The scanning electron microscope (SEM, 
Hitachi S4800) images of the catalyst after 
performing the WGSRs with the conditions 
of steam/CO ratios of 1 and 8 are displayed 
in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively.  
In Fig. 8a where the image is amplified 
by a factor of 30, a lot of noticeable cracks 
take place at the edge of the catalyst. If the 
image is further amplified by 200 times (Fig. 
8b), some tiny cracks are also observed on 
the catalyst surface. In contrast, when the 
catalyst with the steam/CO ratio of 8 is 
examined, Figs. 9a and 9b show that the 
catalyst surface is whole and no cracks are 
found.
