mounted on a stiff base made of stainless steel. Two 
groups of comb electrodes A, B and a set of modal 
sensors designed for four-wavelength wedge waves are 
screen printed on the outer rim of the piezoelectric tube. 
In the current prototype, the wedge has 15o apex angle, 
9.33 mm height and a 40 m truncation on its tip due to 
machining tolerance. The PZT-4 tube has 21.8 mm ID, 
25.8 mm OD and 12.5 mm height.
Vibrations of circular cylindrical structures include 
longitudinal, torsional, and flexural modes. Longitudinal 
modes have a combination of axial and radial motions. 
Torsional modes have unique motions in circumferential 
direction. Three motion components are coupled together 
in flexural modes. The resonant flexural vibration modes 
of a clamped-free hollow cylinder are introduced by a 
pair of integers (m, n). The first integer m is the axial 
mode number for vibration mode which has m nodes of 
zero displacement along the axial length of the cylinder. 
The second integer n is named the circumferential mode 
number which denotes the number of wavelengths of 
standing wave around circumference. Modes for which n
= 1 are specially called the beam modes. The remaining 
flexural modes are called the circumferential modes.
Dispersion curves of frequency versus circumferential 
wave number k, in which k = n/R, and resonant vibration 
modes are important characteristics of wedge waves in the 
stator. It should be noted that circumferential number n is 
positive integer for standing waves or resonant modes. It 
is positive real for traveling waves. Numerical calculation 
is carried out by bi-dimensional FEM and a commercial 
code ANSYS 10.0 (ANSYS Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA).
The former has been shown to have excellent accuracy
and efficiency in computation of acoustic guided waves 
and resonant vibration modes for axisymmetric structures 
such as circular wedges [5], [7].
Fig. 2 shows the dispersion curves for the lowest three 
modes of the wedge waves traveling around the circular 
wedge stator with 15o apex angle. The lines represent the 
calculated results using bi-dimensional FEM. The dots 
indicate those resonant frequencies evaluated by ANSYS. 
The former calculation used 1,900 Q4 elements and 
passed the convergence test. The latter lacks accuracy as 
the mode numbers (m, n) become greater values although 
145,440 3-D elements (solid-5) are employed. 
B.2. Modal Separation
The fundamental resonant frequencies of commercial 
piezoelectric products are usually available in data sheet 
Fig. 2. Calculated dispersion curves (solid lines) for wedge 
waves and resonant frequencies (dots) of mode (m, n) in the 15o
apex angle circular wedge stator with h = 0 shown in the inset.

provided by most manufacturers. Hoverer, the products 
might not satisfy the demand for clear modal separation 
between resonant frequencies in neighborhood of driving 
frequency of the rotary wedge wave motor. In addition, 
resonant frequencies do not appear monotonically in 
sequence of the order of resonant vibration modes.
Trimming modal separation between resonant frequencies
is therefore a critical issue in designing this type of motor 
stator. The change of the height h of base structure has 
significant influence on the modal separation. This paper 
proposes a new idea to trim modal separation using 
dispersion curves of flexural waves instead of frequency 
response function. 
Referred to the dashed lines shown in Fig. 2, resonant 
frequencies of the first three modes decrease specially in 
the range of small circumferential number as the value of 
h increases. Table 1 lists changes in resonant frequencies 
of the stator if the height h increases from none to 12.5 
mm. The modes of higher values of m have more changes
in their resonant frequencies. In this case, the resonant 
mode (1, 4) which is utilized to drive the motor has modal 
separation of at least 4 kHz from its neighboring modes (2, 
1) and (3, 2). 
B.3. Dual Phase Excitation
Two standing waves, in which amplitude of particle 
motion is a function of circumferential position only, are 
excited by two comb transducers located on opposite 
sides of the piezoelectric hollow cylinder. A traveling 
wave can be formed by constructive interference of two 
equal-intensity standing waves in 90o phase difference.
Both comb electrodes have stripe width equal to one
quarter of wavelength. Besides the phase difference, the 
angular space between two groups of comb electrodes 
must satisfy the following relation:

inset. Arrow (P) denotes poling direction of piezoelectric device.
Fig. 6. Free and loaded traveling wave detected by a set of four 
modal sensors located on the 15o apex angle wedge stator.
Signals of traveling waves induced at different driving 
frequencies by two comb transducers designed for the 
four-wavelength motor under distinct loading conditions 
are shown in Fig. 6. Although amplitude observed by each 
sensor may not be the same, phases are perfectly identical. 
A well time harmonic signal appears if traveling wave is 
driven at resonant frequency of mode (1, 4). Once driving 
frequency differs from that of desired mode, signal has 
apparently small amplitude and phase change. As rotor 
exerts contact force on stator, increased dynamic strains 
in stator results that the signal has greater amplitude. 
C.2. Performance Test
The revolution speed of rotor is proportional to the 
amplitude of driving voltage. The threshold voltage is 
about 100 Vpp. The maximum driving voltage is 200 Vpp. 
Fig. 7 shows measured performance of revolution speeds
versus torques for different positions at which rotor is 
pressed to contact with stator. The motor rotates fast if 
contact position is close to the wedge tip. On the contrary, 
higher torque output at lower angular speed is achieved at 
contact area near the bottom of wedge.
D. Conclusion
A novel wedge wave USM driven by circumferential 
modes rather than the beam mode used in traditional 
cylindrical USMs is proposed in this work. The abnormal 
wobble of rotor and stress concentration can be prevented

motor under preload 72 gw at different contact positions.
in this motor. A prototype of four-wavelength motor was
fabricated. It achieves the maximum holding torque of 
0.1875 kg-cm under preload 72 gw and the maximum 
angular speed of 177 rpm. The rotary speed and direction 
are controllable by altering driving voltage and specific 
phase difference between two comb transducers.
Several tuning techniques have been used to guarantee 
the proposed motor functions as expectation. High modal 
separation up to 4 kHz in the neighborhood of mode (1, 4) 
was achieved by use of dispersion curves to trim resonant 
frequencies of the motor stator. The experimental data are 
in good agreement with the prediction. Moreover, the 
modal sensors are first time used to in situ monitor 
dynamic responses of USMs instead of other expensive 
instrument such as LDV. The best advantage of the 
proposed motor is that torque output can be traded with 
revolution speed only by varying contact position of rotor 
on the inclined surface of wedge stator without changing 
whole structure.

Fig. 4 depicts the dispersion curves of the Lamb 
wave propagation along the [100] axis in a 1 μm 
Ge/500 μm Si wafer.  Two cases were calculated.  
The first case ignores the lattice misfit between Ge 
film and Si substrate and the residual stresses.  
Both materials are assumed to be bonded perfectly.   
In the second case, the Ge film is assumed to be a 
single layer under homogeneous biaxial stresses of 
−5 GPa and deposited on the Si substrate.   
 
Since the Ge film is much thinner than the Si 
substrate, we assume that the residual stresses only 
appear in the Ge film.  The TOE constants and the 
compression due to lattice misfit are considered 
only in the Ge film so that the elastic stiffness 
constants are modified in the thin-film using (3).  
Material constants in the substrate are still the 
same.  The velocity changes of the Lamb waves 
are below ±5 m/s for both cases in a broad 
frequency range form 0 to 20 MHz.  The result 
indicates the AE effect on the Lamb modes of a 
multilayered heterostructure is too small to 
determine the residual stressed in the thin-film. 
 
Another structure of the stressed thin-film system 
shown as Fig. 5 was considered to get rid of the 
influence of thicker substrate on the AE effect in 
the stressed thin-film.  The Si substrate is 
partially etched from the bottom so that the 
thin-film is suspended as a single plate fixed by the 
remaining substrate.  No change appears in the 
stressed state of the film.  Fig. 6 shows the phase 
velocities of Lamb modes propagating along the 
[100] axis in a single Ge film.  In contrast to 
previous results in Fig. 5, the AE effect is 
significant for stressed film according to the 
comparison between the dispersion curves 
calculated for the Ge film under biaxial stresses of 
−1 GPa and those of stress-free state.
