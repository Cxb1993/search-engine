Abstract 
In this report, a new digital image 
stabilization involving multiple objects 
motion detection based on block-based 
Hough transform (HT) is presented. The line 
edges in a pair of edge blocks, where one is 
from current frame and the other is from 
previous frame are aligned to generate 
potential motion vectors to have votes on 
parameter voting matrix H using modified HT.  
The parameter voting matrix H is used for 
identifying feasible motion vectors, which 
generate the representative motion vector for 
compensation. The unexpected camera 
vibration is removed regardless of object’s 
movement using the proposed image 
stabilization algorithm. The experimental 
results show that the proposed method 
outperforms traditional block-matching based 
digital image stabilization methods. 
1. Introduction 
Given an unstable video, image 
stabilization aims at synthesizing a new 
image sequence such that the unwanted image 
motion caused by camera motion is removed. 
Three approaches to image stabilization are 
proposed in the literature: digital image 
stabilization (DIS), electronic image stabilizer 
(EIS), and optical image stabilizer (OIS) [1]. 
Among them, DIS can be implemented on 
either hardware or software; however, both of 
EIS and OIS are hardware dependent. In 
general, a DIS system involves global motion 
estimation between consecutive frames and 
motion correction which removes the 
annoying irregular perturbations using the 
estimated global motion vector. The accuracy 
of the global motion estimation is the key to 
success for a DIS system. An incorrect global 
motion vector leads to many missing areas 
and significant motion blur. Although the 
problem of global motion estimation has been 
extensively studied, it remains as a challenge 
since that the exact camera model is in 
general unknown and some fast moving 
objects might exist in image sequences [2].    
The common approaches for global motion 
estimation include the block-matching 
approach [3], the feature-based approach [4] 
and the global intensity alignment approach 
[5]. Pixel based block matching suffers from 
the problem of unreliable local motion 
vectors which then result in incorrect global 
motion vectors. It is likely to produce 
unstable local motion vectors by applying 
block matching to the regions without salient 
patterns such as edges or to the regions 
containing periodic, quasi-periodic or random 
pixels [6]. The feature-based approach is 
achieved by extracting feature points in the 
first frame and then tracking them in every 
subsequent frame of the sequence. The 
feature-based approach fails in detecting the 
global motion vector since the feature points 
might be vanished when intended motion 
exists or the tracking scheme aggregates too 
much error [7]. On the other hand, the high 
computation complexity limits the usage of 
the global intensity alignment approach in 
real-time applications. 
In this report, we present an adaptive 
method to detect accurate global motion for 
robust image stabilization via excluding 
unstable local motion vectors using 
block-based Hough transform (BHT). The 
primary contribution of this paper is the use 
of perceptual grouping incorporating the use 
of a voting process for global motion vector 
inference from sparse and noisy local motion 
vectors between adjacent frames.  In 
traditional DIS framework, three basic 
modules --local motion vectors estimation, 
stable regions selection, and global motion 
vector regression, are performed 
independently. According to the proposed 
computation framework, these three modules 
are unified based on the modified HT. 
2. Multiple object motion estimation 
based on BHT 
The key to success for video stabilization is 
to detect and separate multiple motions 
caused by camera pan, instable background, 
and object movement. Most of video 
stabilization algorithms are dedicated to 
where |sec| lldl   is the translation distance 
to align the edge pattern of B with that of B

when the centers of B and B

 are coincided 
and N is the size of block. Combining (1) and 
(2), we obtain the final motion vector

 . In addition, a rotation angle 
||   can be obtained using the edge 
alignment process. 
Once B and B’ are aligned, the vote 
strength for B to vote on the cell (x,y,) in the 
three-dimensional parameter space H is 
obtained from

where h1 and h2 (h’1 and h’2) denote the two 
representative pixel values of  B ( B’).  
Based on the voting scheme, the modified 
HT, named as BHT, to generate saliency 
motion vector map is summarized as the 
following steps: 
1. Divide current frame into multiple 
non-overlapping blocks. 
2. Perform proposed moment-preserving edge 
detector to detect line edges in each image 
block. 
3. Quantize the (x,y,) space into a 
3-dimensional motion vector matrix H with 
appropriate quantization levels. 
4. Initialize the matrix H to zero. 
5. For each edge block B = ),,,( 21 lhh  , do the 
following steps: 
5.1 according to the search window of B, 
perform edge alignment process with each 
edge block B’ in previous frame to obtain the 
motion vector (x,y) and rotation angle

5.2 compute the vote strength ),( BBV  using

5.3 H(x,y,)=H(x,y,)+ ),( BBV  ; 
3. Selection of optimal motion vector for 
image compensation 
A post-processing step is included in the 
proposed DIS system to detect cohesive 
objects with motion vectors from H based on 
BHT. Let MVi, i= 1,..,n be the candidate 
motion vectors corresponding to n peaks of H. 
Using MVi to compensate an image block B in 
current frame, we can obtain the following 
error in terms of sum of absolute difference

where MN represents the size of B, Cij is a

Cij based on MVi in the reference frame. 
Based on SAD, the optimal motion vector

BMV  for B is defined as

As mentioned above, instable regions lead 
to inaccurate global motion vector estimation. 
B is assessed as an instable block if 
)( *BMVSAD , whereis a pre-defined 
threshold. 
Excluding instable blocks, we associate 
each edge block B in the current frame to 
*
BMV . The objects consisting of blocks with 
consistent motion vectors are then segmented. 
Similarly, the global and object motions can 
be discriminated in the sense of motion 
estimation error. Based on the detected object 
motions, the global motion vector GMV is 
defined as

4. Experimental Results 
5. Conclusions  
 
In this paper, we have presented a 
voting-based image stabilization algorithm to 
preserve intentional motion while removing 
the non-intentional motion in the image 
sequence. The contributions of the proposed 
method includes: (1) a computational 
framework to detect multiple motion objects  
is proposed; (2) the use of the fast line edge 
alignment scheme to achieve real-time image 
stabilization without specific hardware 
support; (3) instead of using time consuming 
motion estimation, we obtain the motion 
information directly from the voting 
parameters space.  Experimental results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
method. 
   To further verify the performance of the 
proposed scheme, experiences on image 
sequences with complex motion should be 
added.
