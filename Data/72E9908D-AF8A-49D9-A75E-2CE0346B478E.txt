1. Introduction 
Tin dioxide (SnO2) is widely used as the gas sensor for detecting various gases, 
such as olive oil, CO, H2S, humid air and NO2.[1-6]  It works based on the changes 
of resistance of the SnO2 films in different atmospheres.  Oxygen in air can attach 
itself to the SnO2 film by physical or chemical absorption, which is then converted to 
anions at a certain temperature.  As a result, a depleted layer is generated on the 
surface of the SnO2 films, causing a rise of the resistance.[7-10]  In contrast, when 
SnO2 is placed in the reducing ambience, oxygen ions on the surface will be removed 
with the gain of extra electrons, resulting in the reduction of resistance.  By simply 
measuring the resistance changes of the SnO2 films, the above processes can be 
exploited to detect either oxidizing or reducing gases.  However, there are a few 
problems yet to be solved before the SnO2 gas sensors can be used in practice, one of 
which is the poor selectivity of SnO2 for a specific gas.  One way to overcome this 
problem is by doping SnO2 with other elements, such as Fe, Os, Ni, Pd, Ru and Pt.[1, 
11-15]  These elements enhance the selectivity for various gases due to their 
particular catalytic properties for the relevant reactions leading to the change of 
resistance.  Furthermore, some of the elements have also been found to improve the 
sensor sensitivity and to reduce the operating temperature. 
In this paper, we report the comparative study on the gas sensing properties of 
the pure and Mo-doped SnO2 films grown by RF magnetron sputtering.  MoOx itself 
has been used as a gas sensor material and Mo was also reported to possess good 
catalytic properties for redox reactions of some gases, such as alkanes, ammonia, 
hydrogen, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).[16-18]  Therefore, it was expected 
that introducing Mo into the SnO2 films would improve both the sensitivity and 
selectivity for certain gases.  Indeed, there were a few reports for the improved gas 
sensing properties of SnO2:Mo, for instance, an increase of selectivity for NO2 and 
alcohol gases.[19-20]  However, previous works were aimed at individual gas of 
specific interest and a systematic study on a range of gases is required to assess the 
benefits of Mo doping in terms of potential commercial applications.  There are 
many methods that can be used to prepare SnO2, such as sol-gel, spray pyrolysis, 
ion-beam or magnetron sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, etc.[21-24]  Here, we 
chose to use RF magnetron sputtering to deposit SnO2 films, because it is a fast and 
scalable method with a good control of film thickness over large area.

3-1 XPS spectra 
As mentioned in the last section, the amount of Mo in the co-sputtered SnO2:Mo 
films was controlled experimentally by the Mo target power.  The actual Mo content 
in the obtained films was examined by the XPS spectra and the results for the films 
annealing at 500 oC are summarized in Table 1.  In the XPS analysis, the measured 
binding energies were calibrated against the C1s peak (284.6 eV) of the residual 
carbon absorbed on surface from ambient atmosphere.  The amount of each element 
was calculated from the areas under its characteristic peaks, whose intensities had 
been corrected by the sensitivity factor of the instrument.  The Mo concentrations of 
the films sputtered with the target power 60, 80 and 100 W were 5.1, 9.1 and 10.6 at%, 
respectively.  It was found that there was a preferential loss of Mo over Sn during the 
sintering, because of the higher vapor pressure of Mo oxides.[25-27]  The 
concentration changes of the as-deposited films and the films sintered at 500 °C and 
600 °C were shown in Table 2.  A loss of 18.3% Mo was observed after the films 
deposited at room temperature were subsequently sintered at 600 °C in air for 4 hr. 
Although the solid-solution limit of MoO3 in SnO2 can approach 20 at.%,[28] the 
highest Mo doping level studied in this work was 8.5%, because higher concentration 
was not beneficial for the sensing property, as will be discussed later. 
By careful fitting of the measured XPS curves with the known MoOx 
references,[29] it was found that there was small amount of Mo5+ present in the films, 
although the dominant valence of Mo was 6+, as illustrated in Fig.1.  The calculated 
Mo5+/Mo6+ ratios of the films annealed at different temperatures are listed in Table 3, 
which showed an increase of the Mo5+ trace with the increase of annealing 
temperature.  Because the free energy of Mo oxidation increased with the 
temperature,[30] small amount of Mo6+ might be reduced to Mo+5 at high temperature, 
resulting in the increase of the Mo5+/Mo6+ ratio.

3-2 Microstructure and surface morphology 
The film thickness was measured to be around 200 nm after deposition for 30 
min.  This was the typical thickness of samples used for all the measurements below. 
The GIXRD patterns of the films deposited at room temperature with the Mo doping 
levels from 0 to 10.6 at% are shown in Fig 2(a), where no distinctive reflection line 
can be observed, indicating that the samples were amorphous or had extremely small 
grain size.  There was no observable difference in GIXRD between the as-grown 
films deposited in pure Ar and in the mixture of Ar/O2.  After post-deposition 
annealing in air at 500oC (or above) for 4 hours, the films showed several reflection 
peaks, which could be indexed according to the structure of the tetragonal SnO2 
(JCPDS 41-1445), as shown in Fig.2.  No other reflection line except those from 
SnO2 was observed, suggesting that Mo had incorporated into the SnO2 lattice.  To 
back up the GIXRD result that the films did not include any Mo-containing secondary 
phase, such as SnMoxOy, α-MoO3, and β-MoO3 reported elsewhere,[23-25]  TEM 
examinations were carried out at low magnification and the diffraction patterns from 
one area to other area were taken. Fig.3(a) was a typical micrograph, which showed 
that the grain size of the films was in the order of 10 nm.  Fig. 3(b) was a 
representative diffraction pattern of the SnO2 : Mo films, which again matched well 
with the structure of the tetragonal SnO2 and there was no other phase identified.

3-2 Gas sensing properties of SnO2: x% Mo films 
      The gas sensitivity (S) is defined as followed: 
S = Ra/Rg                     [2] 
where Ra is the resistance of the sample in air (i.e. the reference atmosphere) and 
Rg is the resistance in the ambient gas to be tested. Shown in Fig.6 are the 
sensitivities of the SnO2: x% Mo films (x=0, 7.3, 9.1, 10.6), measured in 100 ppm 
ethanol in the temperature range from 300 to 450oC. It was observed that the 
sensitivity rose with the operating temperature for all the pure SnO2 samples annealed 
at different temperatures, as shown in Fig.6(a). The increase of sample annealing 
temperature was not beneficial, which resulted in a decrease of the sensitivity. The 
best sensitivity was actually obtained for the lowest annealing temperature of 500oC, 
which had S= 15.54 at the operating temperature 450oC. Lower annealing temperature 
was not attempted, because it was too close to the operating temperature and the 
samples obtained might not be able to maintain a long-term stability. 
 The effect of the sintering temperature on sensitivity followed the same trend for 
the Mo-doped films (Fig.6b-d), i.e. a better sensitivity was achieved at a lower 
sintering temperature.  Doping of Mo in SnO2 did not improve the ethanol sensitivity 
at high working temperatures (400-450 °C) and the sensitivity was actually getting 
worse for the samples of high Mo concentration.  However, the ethanol sensitivity of 
the Mo-doped SnO2 was markedly improved at low working temperatures (300-350 
°C), as shown in Fig.6b-d.  The best Mo doping level was found to be about 7.3 at % 
and such doped samples showed a sensitivity S=7.97 at the working temperature of 
300 °C, compared to S=2.92 for the pure SnO2 films at the same working temperature. 
The result was consistent with an earlier work by Ivanovskaya et al, which also 
showed an improved sensitivity on ethanol at the working temperature of around 300 
°C for the Mo-doped SnO2 films grown by sol-gel method.[20] This is of practical 
importance for gas sensor applications since lower working temperature not only 
increases the durability, but also reduces the energy consumption.  Shown in Fig.7 
are the response and recovery curves of the pure and 7.3% Mo-doped films, which 
were recorded at the working temperatures between 300～450°C.  The measured 
response and recovery times are summarized in Table 6 As we can see, the pure and 
doped films showed little difference in both response time and recovery time.  It is 
also observed that the response time of the films was almost independent on the 
working temperature in the measured range, which was around 3-5 seconds.  But the 
recovery time in air was reduced as the working temperature increased, from about 50 
seconds at 300 °C to about 15 seconds at 450°C.

trend as the acidity listed in Table 5 (the pKa values).  The first three alcohols are the 
primary alcohols and their acidity decreases as the number of alkyl groups increases, 
whereas isopropanol and t-butanol are the secondary and tertiary alcohols, 
respectively, and therefore have the lower acidity accordingly.  Apparently, the 
ability for the gases to release protons increases the product rate of the above 
reactions, resulting in a larger reduction of resistance. 
In the Mo-doped SnO2 films, MoOx groups acted as the catalytic sites, changing 
the rates of above reactions.  Depending on the sintering temperature, the Mo sites in 
the SnO2 films might have different solid acidity.  It was reported that at the sintering 
temperature of 500 °C or below Brønsted acid sites were formed,[36] which are able 
to donate, or at least partially transfer, a proton that becomes associated with the 
surface anions.[37]  Therefore, formation of such acid sites facilitated above 
reactions at low working temperatures. At high working temperatures (>350 °C), 
thermal activation of above reactions became dominant and the catalysts had little 
effect, thus explaining the experimental results that the Mo-doped films had higher 
sensitivity than the pure films only at low working temperatures (Fig.6).  One of the 
mechanisms proposed for the acid site formation in the Mo loaded SnO2 was the 
reduction of Mo6+=O to Mo5+−OH.[36]  The latter was able to donate a proton under 
oxidation condition. Indeed, the XPS analysis showed the presence of Mo5+ in our 
films, as discussed in the previous section. 
    When SnO2:Mo films were presented in amine gases (e.g. NH3), the oxygen ions 
will react with the amines according to the following process: 
2NH3+5O-Æ2NO+3H2O+5e-                  [8] 
2NO+2NH3+O-Æ2N2+3H2O+e-                   [9] 
Although ammonia is well-known as a base, it can also act as an extremely weak 
acid. The exothermic reaction of ammonia with oxygen is very difficult in air without 
the presence of a catalyst.  However, the measured ammonia sensitivity of the pure 
SnO2 films was comparable to the alcohol gases in Fig.8.  This was probably due to 
the higher absorption of the ammonia than the alcohol gases in the SnO2 films.  The 
acidic properties of pure SnO2 have been measured by the temperature programmed 
desorption (TPD) of ammonia and methanol, and the results showed that ammonia 
could be chemically adsorbed up to 527 °C, while methanol was almost completely 
desorbed at 277°C.[36]  Therefore, for the alcohol gases, the absorbility of the 
catalyst sites had very little contribution to the catalytic effect and the site acidity 
played the key role, whereas for the amines gases, the site absorption had more 
effective result.

4. Conclusion 
   Pure and Mo-doped SnO2 films have been deposited on the glass substrates by 
sputtering from the metallic Sn and Mo targets with subsequent annealing in air at 
various temperatures from 500 to 700oC.  The properties of the grown films have 
been studied for gas sensor applications.  The optimum annealing temperature was 
found to be 500oC. Pure and the doped films annealed at this temperatures showed 
best sensitivities for both alcohol and amine gases.  While there was no distinct 
difference between the pure and the Mo-doped films for the alcohol gases at the 
operating temperature of 400oC, the latter showed clearly improved sensitivities at 
lower temperature (300oC), e.g. the ethanol sensitivity of SnO2: 7.3% Mo was 
measured to be 16.47 and 7.97 at 400oC and 300oC, respectively compared to 14.77 
and 2.92 for the pure SnO2. 
    On the other hand, the SnO2: 7.3% Mo films responded much more sensitively to 
the amine gases than pure SnO2 films. With the optimum Mo content of 7.3 at%, the 
doped films showed a sensitivity as high as 29.49 for hydrazine.  It is understood 
that the Lewis acid sites are presented in the pure SnO2 films, which increases the 
adsorption of the amine gases but are not catalytically active to the reactions leading 
to the resistance change.  Doping of Mo introduces Brønsted acid sites, which have 
the effect to increase the reaction activity. It is the combined effects of the two that 
leads to the great increase of sensitivity for the amine gases in the Mo-doped SnO2 
films.
