1. Abstract 
 
In this study, cationic chitosans with 
various molecular weights were first 
separately conjugated on the surface of 
colloidal gold particles and then used to carry 
DNA plasmids across target cells. To 
synthesize chitosan-capped gold 
nanoparticles (CGPNs), thiol-grafted 
chitosans were used to exchange citrate ions 
from gold nanoparticles. Both thiol-grafted 
chitosan and CGPN were characterized by 
UV-VIS spectrometer, analysis of Ellman’s 
reagent, and dynamic light scattering. By 
means of UV-vis, size spectra, TEM image, 
and XPS spectra, we could obtain that 
thiolated group had stronger and stabler 
binding to the surface of gold nanoparticles. 
The size distribution of chitosan-MAA 
labeled GNPs were about 38.7 nm, and the 
bind of S-Au were showed in XPS spetra. 
Positively-charged CGPNs were then used to 
form complexes with plasmid encoded with 
enchanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 
and subsequently interacted NIH 3T3 cells. 
Effects of pH, chitosan/Au ratio, reductants, 
N/P ratio on EGFP expression using CGNs 
were explored. By transfection of Chitosan- 
tagged GNPs with plasmid, potential eIF2α 
target sequences (AACTGTAGTGGAGGTG 
TCAACTGAA) for siRNA production. 
Initially we determined the optimum eIF2 
sequence for siRNA mediated inhibition. The 
siRNA (2.5 nmole) was transfected using 
polyethyleneimine (PEI) and CMGNPs as the 
vector (N/P ratio = 3) into HT-29 cells for 
assay at 48 h post-transfection. Transfected 
cells were examined by microscope images 
for the proportion of apoptotic cells detected 
by TUNEL assay were also performed to 
further confirm cell apoptosis, in comparison 
with scrambled siRNA as the control group.

2. Introduction  
 
To facilitate the delivery of genetic 
material, the use of appropriate carriers, or 
vectors, is necessary to protect DNA from 
degradation extra- and intra- cellularly, and 
to aid cellular penetration. Despite the high 
transfection efficiencies attainable using viral 
vectors, they are limited in the size of 
plasmid they can transport and are hampered 
by manufacturing difficulties, limited 
targeting ability, and safety concerns. 
Recently, various kinds of inorganic 
nanomaterials have been demonstrated to 
possess the ability to condense and deliver 
DNA, such as carbon nanotubes [1], silica 
nanoparticles [2], quantum dots [3], hybrid 
nanorods [4], Au nanoparticles [5] and Au 
nanorods [6], etc. Among these inorganic 
materials, Au-based nanomaterials seem to 
be the most appealing because of their good 
biocompatibility [7], particular optical 
properties, high electron density, and ease of 
conjugation to biomolecules [8]. Vectors 
based on cationic polymers (polycations) are 
particularly attractive because of their 
 4 
hypolipidemic as well as hypo- 
cholesterolemic agents [21, 22]. 
  Protein synthesis initiation can be 
affected by the activity or availability of 
initiation factors, mainly eIF2 and eIF4F. [23] 
Translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) forms a 
complex with GTP and Met-tRNAMet, 
which then binds to the 40S ribosomal 
subunit along with other  factors. This 
preinitiation complex associates with the 
heterotrimeric factor eIF4F, bound to the 5’ 
cap structure on the mRNA through its eIF4E 
subunit, and initiates scanning of the message 
until an AUG codon is encountered. At this 
point GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, with the 
release of eIF2-GDP and other initiation 
factors. The eIF2-bound GDP is exchanged 
to GTP by eIF2B. eIF2 in mammals is the 
target of four known kinases, GCN2, HRI, 
PKR and PEK/PERK, which phosphorylate 
speciﬁcally the Ser51 residue of its alpha 
subunit (eIF2α), and are activated by amino 
acid starvation, low levels of heme, double 
stranded RNA and accumulation of unfolded 
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, 
respectively. The translation initiation 
complex eIF2 is a heterotrimer of eIF2α, 
eIF2β and eIF2γ. This complex binds to GTP 
and Met-tRNA. It transfers Met-tRNA to the 
40s subunit of the ribosome to form the 43s 
pre-initiation complex. Successive rounds of 
translation and initiation are promoted by 
exchanging GDP for GTP. Phosphorylation 
of eIF2α by PeRK inactivates eIF2α, 
resulting in inhibition of cap-dependent 
translation initiation. The phosphorylated 
form of eIF2 [eIF2α(P)] acts as a competitive 
inhibitor of eIF2β, thus lowering or blocking 
translation initiation. In the brain 
ischemia-reperfusion model, phosphorylation 
of eIF2α is observed in selected vulnerable 
neurons, and has been correlated with the 
activation of PERK.[24] In this work, we 
investigated the phosphorylation status of 
brain eIF2a following the induction of 
temporal lobe epilepsy by pilocarpine in 
mice.[25] 
Our results showed the average particle 
size of chitosan-capped gold nanoparticles 
(CGNPs) can be manipulated in 38.7 and 
140.1 nm by adjusting the molar ratio of 
HAuCl4 to NaBH4. Complexes of 
CMGNPs-III and plasmid encoded with 
enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) 
were formed by electrostatic interaction and 
then incubated with NIH 3T3 cells over 24 h. 
The experimental result of EGFP expression 
rate was only 30-40% which is surprisingly 
low. Several issues such as the charge of 
CMGNPs, pH value, and chitosan/Au ratio, 
and N/P ratio playing vital roles on the 
efficiency of gene transfection remain to be 
explored to achieve high efficiency of 
transfection. 
  
3. Materials and methods 
   
Depolymerization of chitosan. One gram of 
chitosan was completely dissolved in 100 mL 
2% acetic acid solution, and then 4.25 mL of 
35% H2O2 aqueous solution was added. The 
solution was stirred and reacted at 80℃ for 1 
hr, respectively. After the reaction, the 
solution was filtrated. First, the solution thus 
obtained was filtered by using a sintered 
funnel, and the filtrate was dialyzed (3.5 kD 
cutoff) against deionized water. Then, the 
filtrate was dialyzed (6 kD cutoff) 
extensively against deionized water, and the 
dialysate containing chitosan with MW 
ranging from 3.5 to 6 kDa (for simplicity, 
well called it chit5). Water-soluble chit5 was 
freeze-dried by freeze dryer and collected in 
the powder form. 
    Synthesis of chit5-MAA compound. 
Chit5, chit12 and chit50 dissolved into 
deionized water was reacted with MAA in 
the presence of EDC dissolved in 0.1 M MES 
buffer for 24 h at room temperature. The 
molar ratio of chitosan/EDC/MAA was 
1:5:10. All products was dialyzed (3.5 kD 
cutoff) against deionized water. The solution 
containing MAA-chitosan (5, 12, 50 kD) 
remained in the dialysis tube was 
freeze-dried and stored for later use.  
    Determination of the thiol group content. 
The degree of modification was determined 
by qualitative analysis the amount of thiol 
groups on the modified chitosan with 
Ellman’s reagent. First, 5 mg of 
MAA-chitosan (5, 12, 50 kD) was dissolved 
in 2.5 mL of demineralized water. 250 μL of 
0.5 M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and 500 μL of 
Ellman’s reagent dissolved in 10 mL of 0.5 
 6 
assay.  
All these factors could synergistically 
contribute to the observed enhancement in 
efficiency. Prompted by the aforementioned 
observations, we set out to explore 
alternative means of generating novel 
efficient chit5 based gene-delivery vectors. 
The underlying premise of this study is that 
conjugating chit5 to GNPs would increase its 
effective molecular weight, consequently 
enhance DNA binding and condensation, and 
therefore improve transfection. GNPs seemed 
appealing because of their biocompatibility, 
optical properties, high electron density, and 
ease of conjugation to biomolecules. In fact, 
for these reasons GNPs are actively 
investigated for various bioanalytical and 
biomedical applications [29-35]; for example, 
due to the high electron density of gold, the 
cellular trafficking of GNP bioconjugates is 
readily monitored by TEM. To identify the 
optimal conjugates in terms of transfection 
efficiency, three different chitosan/Au molar 
ratios were prepared. CMGNPs-III and 
CGNPs-III the conjugates exhibited the 
plasmon band of GNPs with λ max ≒520 nm 
(Fig. 2(b)). The sizes of the gold core 
deduced from DLS were 38.7±4.3 nm for 
CMGNPs-III and 140.2±7.6 nm for 
CGNPs-III in Figure 2(c). And, TEM image 
of CMGNPs-III  showed in Fig. 2(d) clearly 
demonstrated the morphology and real size 
of chitosan-tagged GNPs. 
The composition of thiolated chitosan 
modified gold nanoparticles was analyzed by 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A 
monochromatic A1 Kα X-ray source at 
1486.68 eV was used. The X-ray power, the 
pass energy of the analyzer and the takeoff 
angle of the photoelectron were set at 100 W, 
20 eV, and 50
o
, respectively. The energy 
resolution of this setup was about 0.5 eV, 
estimated by the Ag 3d5/2 peak width at the 
measurement condition. C1s, Au4f, and S2p 
levels were recorded. The binding energy 
was calibrated using the C1s peak energy 
(284.8 eV) as an energy standard. Fig. 2(e) 
shows the S2p spectra of thiolated chitosan 
modified gold nanoparticles (CMGNPs-III) 
with the curves of Au-S and S-S. And Fig. 
2(f) shows the Au4f spectra of thiolated 
chitosan modified gold nanoparticles 
(CMGNPs-III). We detected weak doublet 
peaks where the binding energy at 162.4 eV 
can contributed to sulfur-gold bonding and 
the other peak at 164.1 eV can attributed to 
the X-ray radiation damage to the sample, 
causing progressive sulfur-gold bond 
breaking and creation of the new sulfur 
species [36]. 
We selected the best condition of N/P ratio 
with chit5 only, PEI25, and CMGNPs-III. As 
showed in Fig. 3A, after NIH 3T3 cells 
transfected by 10 of chit5 N/P, 3 of PEI25 
N/P, and 100 of CMGNPs-III (Fig. 3(a-c)) 
N/P for 48 and 72 h in Fig. 3A(I-II), the 
reaults were obtained that the transfection 
percent of the cells by PEI25 and 
CMGNPs-III was better 23.1 and 14.8 than 
4.7 of that by chit5 for 48 h. Nevertheless, 
for 72 h, the cells by CMGNPs-III that rather 
with PEI25 was 38.8, comparing to 2.3 of 
ones by chit5. Detected by flow cytometry in 
figure 6, the transduction inensity of PEI25 
and CMGNPs-III were 38.6 and 39.4. For 
this reason, CMGNPs-III would have better 
transfection to chit5 and biocompatibility. 
Potential eIF2 target sequences for siRNA 
production were obtained by web client 
software and purchased from Invitrogen. 
Initially we determined the optimum eIF2 
sequence for siRNA mediated inhibition. For 
HT-29 cells, cell apoptosis indeed can be 
induced using siRNA eIF2 sequence 
forming complexes with chit5, PEI25, and 
CMGNPs-III. From Fig. 4, the apoptotic 
assays by TUNEL assay showed that the 
prominent apoptosis occurred after cells were 
transfected with siRNA/PEI or 
siRNA/CMGNPs-III complexes and 
continued with additional 48-h incubation by 
comparing to scrambled siRNA with PEI25 
(N/P = 3). The effect of siRNA eIF2 on cell 
apoptosis was augmented with the increase 
of N/P ratio up to 3 by PEI25 and 100 by 
CMGNPs-III. This implies the nonviral 
delivery vector PEI25 played a crucial role 
on the efficiency of siRNA delivery.
