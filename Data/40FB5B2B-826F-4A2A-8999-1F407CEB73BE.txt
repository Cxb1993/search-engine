Furthermore, Construction firms that work on a contractual basis are generally more
concerned with short-term rather than long-term financial strategies. The main focus in
short-term financial strategies is on working capital management (WCM). Cash management is a
major factor for achieving good liquidity and profitability. In this study we take into
consideration the cash component of working capital management based on the target cash
balance. We develop a practical model that should allow Taiwan construction firms to utilize the
currently available cash and assets at any point in time in the most rational way. To help
understand the issues involved, we first introduce a model developed by Miller and Orr. The
relationship between project duration and progress towards completion is most effectively
represented in practical construction management by the S-curve. Thus, in this study we plot the
fuzzy S-curve regression based on the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The practicality of the
model is demonstrated using project cash flow and progress payment records from a sample
project. The data are obtained from the Taipei City Government’s Department of Rapid Transit
Systems. Some tentative conclusions concerning the model are also given.

41. Introduction
Internal waves are motion at an interface of different densities in the interior of the atmosphere
or the ocean. Those in a stratified water body are mostly caused by a difference in water
temperature or salinity. Although temperature in a water column in the ocean varies continuously,
the simplest density structure is the approximation of a stratified two-layer system. The interface
between any two layers of different densities is called pycnocline. When the density difference is
due to temperature it is called thermocline, and halocline due to salinity. One of the key
parameters for the formation of the internal gravity waves (IGW) is density stratification. In all
field experiments the IGW was found at the depth of changing density profile called a pycnocline.
In fact the properties of this pycnocline seem to influence the form and location of the IGW
observed.
Like their counterpart of gravity waves on the ocean surface, at the interface of two media of
different densities, i.e., water and air, the IGWs are waves at the interface between two fluid
layers of different densities. In both cases, the restoring force is gravity, which is the reason why
they are known as gravity waves. These waves are generated when an interface is disturbed. In
the case of surface gravity waves, this disturbance can be caused by a stone thrown into the water
or by wind blowing over the surface. In the case of internal gravity waves in the ocean, the
disturbance is usually caused by tidal flow pushing the layered water body over the interface or
over submarine obstacles, e. g., sills or ridges (Maxworthy, 1979; Helfrich et al.; 1984; Lamb,
1994; Liu et al., 1998; Hsu et al., 2000; Lamb 2004a; Munroe and Lamb, 2005). There are
several ways to observe an internal wave. The velocity-depth profile which is desirable for the
theorist is not easy to obtain. More commonly one measures conductivity-temperature-depth
(henceforth CTD) profile, then calculates the density-depth relationship. It is also possible to use
acoustic echo-sounding or radar, despite having difficulty to extract quantitative data from these
methods. IGWs in the ocean have wavelengths ranging from hundreds of meters to tens of
62. Experimental design
Laboratory experiments were conducted in a steel-framed wave flume of 12m long, with a
cross-section of 0.7m high by 0.5m wide supported by a polycarbonate bottom panel. The
experimental apparatus are given schematically in Fig. 2. Side view and cross-section are also
shown in Fig. 3. A removable sluice gate panel for generating internal waves was mounted at one
end of the flume, while removable steel panels at the other end for investigating internal wave
evolutions on a uniform slope. Six pairs of ultrasonic probes and capacitance wave gauges (Fig.
4) were connected to an amplifier unit and A/D converter (Fig. 5), then to in a personal computer
for processing the digital signals of the internal waves. The toe of each test slope was located
approximately at between 8.18m to 8.95m from the sluice gate. No wave absorbing facilities were
introduced at either end of the flume; thus incident waves were free to reflect back and forth
within the flume between the slope and the gate. Wave attenuation by energy damping primarily
originated from viscous effect took up more than several tens of minutes approximately.
Laboratory experiments were performed with a two-layer fluid system of fresh and brine
water in the flume. The upper layer was fresh water with density ρ1, to a depth H1. The fresh
water body was allowed to stand overnight for the temperature to equilibrate with the ambient
condition. The medium of the lower layer was brine water with densityρ2, which was premixed
separately in a constant head tank and filled slowly into the flume to a depth of H2 by gravity
through several small openings at the bottom panel of the flume. Brine water in the mixing tank
(Fig. 6) had to be carefully infused beneath the fresh water, with a thin piece of sponge placed at
every entry point to ensure uniform diffusion into the two-layer fluid system with minimum
disturbance and mixing at the interface. Densities of water for the upper layer were maintained at
999 kg/m3 and about 1030 kg/m3 approximately for the lower layer. Internal solitary waves were
generated by pneumatically lifting the sluice gate (Fig. 7) followed by overturning the brine water
behind the gate. To achieve this, first, a mini pump (Fig. 8) was used to remove a small quantity

Remark 3: Based on Assumption 1, the part that can explain Y by ix can be determined
separately, followed by the sum of each part. Figure 11 illustrates this approach.
Remark 3 indicates that all sample data taking part in the problems have been designed.
However, actually, we may not get the data in which the explanatory variables are independent
each other. Additionally, the question of whether Y can be explained adequately in terms of fewer
variables should be explored. An important goal in regression analysis is to describe observed
phenomena in terms of as few meaningful variables as possible. Which variable, or which group
of explanatory variables, is suitable for explaining the variation of Y, must be judged.
Consequently, a significant test with an appropriate hypothesis is given below.

This method can also be employed to examine the relationship between Y and square or
cube of variable X. Figure 12 displays the variable selection procedure.
According to the above concept, if q variables are given, the total number of possible
equation fitted is 2q. These equations include one that contains all the variables, and one
containing no variables. The all subsets selection algorithm is developed to deal with this
computing problem by finding a suitable regression models with the fewest variables from a
group of models with similar correlation coefficient. The all subset selection approach is carefully
analyzed by examining the residuals for outliners, and for the need for transformations, to
determine the final model. Furnival & Wilson (1974) and Motte & Hocking (1970) have
recommended certain shortcuts that do not involve significant computation. However, the
proposed approach still involves a considerable amount of computation with a large number of
variables. Therefore, a stepwise procedure that processes nonlinear data is provided herein.
6. Algorithm for selection of variables
Procedures for selection of variables can be classified as forward selection (FS) and
backward elimination (BE). An integrated algorithm, which is a modification of FS and BE, is
hereby provided and described in the following (Chatterjee and Price, 1991).
6.1 Forward Selection
The forward-selection (FS) technique begins with an equation containing no explanatory
variables, but only a constant term. The first variable included in the strongest simple correlation
with the dependent variable y. If the regression coefficient of this variable is significantly
different from zero, then it is retained in the equation, and a search for a second variable is
performed. The procedure is terminated when the regression coefficient of the last variable
introduced in the equation is judged by the standard F statistic computed from the latest equation.

plot also shows data points that play crucial roles in determining this magnitude. Therefore, to
add the jth variable jx in  1210* ,,,,  jxxxxX  , a figure has to be plotted in which the
y-axis denotes the residue from the regression between Y and *X , and the x-axis denotes the
residue from the regression between jx and
*X . Meanwhile, the F value is described as

The useful Theorem 1 is given below first.
Theorem 1: Let A be an n-dimensional non-singular matrix, and u and v have dimension
1n and n1 , respectively. Then
    111111 1   AvuAvuAAuvA TTT . (33)
The proofs of Theorem 1 and the added variable plot are in the Appendix 4 and 5.
Added variable plots can be applied to examine whether a variable should be added in
model. The forward selection is used along with added variable plots to find a suitable model.
The relationship between the variable and Y, and which variable should be added in model can
both be judged.
Additionally, a constructed variable plot in which the x-axis is the residue from the
regression between constructed variable and *X can be used to adjust the relationship of a
constructed variable and Y. The constructed-variable plot is common practice to formulate other
functions which are constructed as the weighted average or sum of a set of variables that includes
the chosen dependent variable.
8. Practical application
Thereinafter, experimental data (Table 2) in laboratory were processed via above-mentioned
method. Data are divided into four sets including incident wave amplitude (Ai), reflected wave
18
means t value, where u is data from the population. Each population is certainly conformed as a
framework of normal distribution. From the residual plot, it is slightly as close to linear as might
be desired. There seems to be a rough linear with an angular magnitude of 450, so the data set is
considered to be normally distributed. Cook's distance measures how much the unusual values
effect when they are dropped. We marked this point with red-colored number appearing
extraordinary deviation away from the linear curve at lower left in Fig. 14. Before and after this
unusual value was dropped, two regression lines with the data set are plotted in Fig.15 & 16.
These scatterplot clearly indicate that there is a positive association between C1 and C2;
therefore, a plot of the data with the regression line added is shown in the graph. According as the
strengths of the linear association between two variables are quantified as 50% approximately,
correlations of the two variables are related roughly with a regression line of C2 = 0.019C1 +
0.725 adopted by the result of Fig. 16 (i.e. C2 means RA; C1 means Ai). Proceeding to the method
that we present in this study, it is investigated to search other appropriate relationship between
other functions like x2, x-1 through added variable plot and algorithm for selection of variables.
However the results in Fig. 17 shows that in the centre of the search the bands are too narrow
between -0.1 and 0.1, and the data set are randomly distributed. The constructed-variable plot of
Fig. 17 explains it is not unnecessary to add other functions describing the relationship with RA.
That is, the linear regression line of RA = 0.019 Ai + 0.725 is an optimum equation for explaining
two variables with the data set of non-breaking type. The data analyses are processed as section
7.1, so there have briefly representation below the following sections.
8.2 Relation between RA and Ai with all data
At first, we can see the data are normal distribution from the Normal Probability Plot of the
Residual in Fig. 18. Secondly, plotting t values versus u, the regression and calculating unusual
values by the quantities of cook’s distance are shown in Fig. 19. From this graph of Fig. 19, three
unusual points are signed and then dropped for further regression as seen in Fig. 20. It is
20
model with the highest correlation is chosen. This result of subset algorithm is represented in
Table 6. Additionally, Table 7 showed the result of the stepwise regression indicating the best
model to fit the data set is logarithmic function with correlation coefficient 20% only.
9. Conclusions
Recently, owing to the importance of internal wave activities in the South China Sea (SCS),
a joint research program in the region has been funded by the National Science Council (NSC) of
Republic of China and the Office of Naval Research (ONR), U.S.A., respectively. The
participants are oceanographers from various organizations and academics in Taiwan (e.g.
National Taiwan University, National Taiwan Ocean University, National Sun Yat-sen University,
Chinese Naval Academy, National Taiwan Normal University, and Kuang Wu Institute of
Technology), and from the United States (Office of Naval Research, Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, University of Washington), as well as University of the Philippines. Although hidden
in a shallow depth in the ocean, internal waves have been widely studied by physical
oceanographers in the world. Similar to the visible gravity wave oscillations on the ocean surface,
the internal waves are one means for nature to transport mass and energy in the interior column of
the ocean. Its importance has been elaborated in the literatures of physical oceanography, but with
limited engineering applications.
Despite the vigor and often fruitful international research activities on internal waves,
particularly in the United States, research outputs from physical oceanography profession are
limited to the phenomenon of wave propagation rather than the mechanism of wave evolution. It
might be difficult to find a handful of papers devoted to wave evolution over the past two decades.
Furthermore, statistical modeling would be definitely useful for exploring wave evolution, and
even mechanism. It may be stated that fundamental research on the derivation of statistical
algorithm for the internal waves of laboratory experiments had not been available up to now. On
the other hand, we believe that most local physical oceanographers and marine scientists are not

Results of Part 2
Summary
The general approach to modeling binary data for the purpose of estimating the propagation of an
internal solitary wave (ISW) is based on the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) method. In
cases where the number of observations in the data are so small that some observations are close
to zero or one, any inferences made based on the asymptotic distribution of changes in the
deviance1 may be unreliable for binary data, and hence the effect that the explanatory variables
are expected to have on the response probability could be invalid.
To test the global nul hypothesis β=0, we need generate only three Chi-square statistics
(Likelihood Ratio, Score, and Wald tests). Logistic regression shows that the p-values for the
Likelihood Ratio test and the Score test are both < 0.05. However, the null hypothesis is not
rejected in the Wald test. The seeming discrepancies in p-values obtained between the Wald test
and the other two tests are a sign that the large-sample approximation is not stable.
The conditional exact logistic regression model results for the three explanatory variables have a
significant effect on the amplitude-based incident rate. The goodness-of-fit is calculated using the
results of the exact conditional scores test and the probability test. We find that the parameters
and the odds ratio estimates obtained via conditional exact logistic regression are different from
those obtained via unconditional asymptotic logistic regression. Using exact results is a good idea
when the sample size is small and the approximate p-values are less than 0.10. Thus in this study,
given the small sample size and the p-values, exact analysis is more appropriate.

observations with proportions close to zero or one, inferences based on the asymptotic
distribution of the change in deviance may be unreliable. In point of fact reports on statistical
manipulations related to this theme are rather rare.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the experimental set-up
and theoretical background needed to understand the hydrodynamic interaction. We also discuss
the analysis of the logistic regression model, and introduce the exact conditional logistic model
and the hypothesis on which the parameters are based. Section 3 is devoted to a comparison of
the conditional exact logistic regression model and the unconditional asymptotic logistic
regression model. Finally, some conclusions are made. It is noted that small sample size means
that there are some observations with proportions close to zero or one and p-values of less than
0.10, which is an indication that an exact analysis would be more appropriate.
2. Research framework
Experiments were carried out in the laboratory using a two-layer fluid system of fresh and
briny water in a 12m long wave flume (rectangular in cross-section). The upper layer of water in
the wave flume consisted of fresh water with a density ρ1 and a depth H1, while the lower layer
was comprised of brine with a densityρ2 and a depth H2. The leading ISW was generated by the
lifting of a pneumatic sluice gate at one end of the flume. The wave propagated into the main
section of the flume to the left-hand-side (LHS) of the gate. The amplitude a and characteristic
length Lw of the ISW were pre-determined by arranging the step length L and step depth η0 (see
Fig. 1). Six ultrasonic probes connected to an amplifier unit and A/D converter, then to a personal
computer, gathered and processed digital signals as the ISW propagated along the flume. As the
ISW propagated from the RHS (right-hand-side) to the LHS of the flume, the first ultrasonic
probe (P1) recorded the properties of the incident ISW, the wave amplitude and characteristic
length, while the second probe (P2) collected reflected signals showing the wave-obstacle
interaction. The methodology for measuring the physical properties related to the propagation and

3 Analytical results
The effects of the ridge height, the depth of the lower water layer, and the potential energy
on the propagation of the ISW are all considered. The results from the laboratory experiments are
shown in the data sets. The amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves are also included. The
dependent variables for the binary logistic regression model are classified into two groups, weak
and strong, based on the amplitude incident rate. When the hypothetical incident rate >0.5 it is
considered strong and when it is < 0.5 it is considered weak. The frequencies for the strong and
weak levels are 35 and 28, respectively.
3. 1 Asymptotic logistic regression model
The methodologies utilized in the asymptotic logistic regression model and the diagnostics
60
[31] who discussed graphical techniques for logistic regression diagnostics. Generally such
techniques offer a visual rather than numerical representation that may be more intuitively
appealing to some researchers. Index plots are useful for the identification of extreme values [32].
An examination of the index plots of the Pearson residuals (Fig. 2) and the deviance residuals
(Fig. 3) for our data indicate that case 11 and case 27 are poorly accounted for by the model. It
can be seen in the index plot of the diagonal elements of the hat matrix (Fig. 4) that case 49 is at
the extreme point in the design space.

between the Wald test and the other two tests are a sign that the large-sample approximation is
not stable.

3.2 Exact logistic regression model
Exact logistic regression for binary outcomes can be utilized to provide an exact score test
and an exact probability test for hypotheses where the parameters are equal to zero; these tests
produce an exact p-value and a mid p-value.
To test whether individual parameter estimates are zero, we also require point estimates of
the parameters, an odds ratio that contains two-sided confidence limits, and the p-value.
3.2.1 Conditional exact tests: β=0
The results of exact conditional analysis obtained using the exact logistic regression model
are shown in Table 4. The results for the exact score conditional test and the probability test are
also reported in this table. For the joint test it is required that all the parameters for the exact
statement be simultaneously equal to zero, that is, the null hypothesis is H0:β1=β2=β3=0.
In the joint test results an exact p-value of <.0001 is produced; the probability test produces
an exact p-value of 0.0023. These test results lead to a rejection that the null hypothesis of
β1=β2=β3 is zero. This shows that the ridge height (X1), lower layer water depth (X2), and
potential energy (X3) are significant for the joint exact test.
64
results are likely to agree with them.
3.2.2.1 Parameter estimates for unconditional asymptotic logistic regression
The analytical results for the estimated maximum likelihood and odds ratios are shown in
Tables 5 and 6. The ridge height (X1), lower layer water depth (X2) and potential energy (X3) are
all significant factors affecting the amplitude-based incident rate (p=0.0106, p=0.0053 and
p=0.0067, respectively).

NOTE: * indicates a median unbiased estimate.
We can see from Tables 5 and 7 that the parameters obtained from conditional exact logistic
regression are smaller than those obtained from unconditional asymptotic logistic regression, but
the p-values of the unconditional asymptotic estimates are larger than those of the exact estimates.
A comparison of the odds ratio estimates (in Table 6 and Table 8) shows that the parameters
obtained from the conditional exact logistic regression are different than those obtained from the
unconditional asymptotic logistic regression.
Stokes et al. [27] recommended that when sample sizes are small and the approximate
p-values are less than 0.10, it is better to look at the exact results. Thus in this study, the small
sample size and p-values make exact analysis more appropriate.
4. Conclusions
A laboratory experiment is designed to investigate the propagation of an internal solitary
wave over a submerged ridge. Analytical methods and a logistic regression model are employed
to examine the amplitude-based incident rate. Large sample theory may not be suitable for data
with small cell counts. This tends to make tests based on the asymptotic normality of the MLEs
unreliable.
The ridge height, lower layer water depth and potential energy are considered in the
regression model. Once a model has been fitted to the observed values of a binary response
variable, it is essential to check the validity of the fit. We discuss some methods for exploring the
adequacy of the model and some diagnostic methods. The techniques used to examine the
adequacy of a fitted unconditional asymptotic logistic regression model and conditional exact
logistic regressions are known as diagnostics methods for testing the global null hypothesis.

potential energy (X3) effects are all significant factors affecting the amplitude-based incident
rate.
(5) A comparison of the parameters shown in Table 6 and Table 8, and the odds ratio estimates in
Table 6 and Table 8, shows that the parameters and the odds ratio estimates obtained from
conditional exact logistic regression are different from those obtained from unconditional
asymptotic logistic regression. As recommended by Stokes et al. [27], in cases of small sample
sizes where the approximate p-values are less than 0.10, it is a good idea to look at the exact
results. For this study, the small sample size and p-values indicate that an exact analysis would be
more appropriate.

1. Introduction
General contractors play a prominent role in the construction industry supply chain, having the
flexibility that allows them to respond to a variety of construction needs demanded by the
demand chain. Public owners, private property developers, banking institutions and shareholders
of business entities are directly or indirectly involved in the demand chain. There is typically a
superfluous supply of construction companies with similar backgrounds and capabilities on the
market. Under these conditions, players involved in the demand chain must carefully evaluate the
background of a prospective general contractor before entering into a contract with them.
A major criterion for evaluating a general contractor is the liquidity of their firm. A firm with a
healthy liquidity is likely to be solvent, and probably has an energetic operating capability. A
firm's liquidity can be measured by looking at its working capital management, which includes
both short-term assets and debts. However, carrying excess cash can alsoincrease a firm’s overall
financial costs and thus risk of bankruptcy. Therefore, one of the issues investigated in this study
is what would be the most appropriate range of cash balance for ongoing operations in a
construction firm, so as to enable that firm to maintain healthy liquidity, achieve planned profits
and meet all project goals. This investigation is based on the traditional tendering framework and
settings, i.e., separation of design and construction.
The emphasis in working capital management (WCM) is placed on short-term financial
strategies which encompass all investment and management endeavors, and both current assets
and debts. The current assets category in a balance sheet comprised of the following four primary
components: (1) cash and cash equivalents; (2) marketable securities; (3) accounts receivable;
and (4) inventory. The three major items considered as current debts are: (1) accounts payable; (2)
expenses payable, including accrued wages and taxes; and (3) notes payable. A firm's liquidity,
72
on fuzzy theory have been proposed in the literature (Peter 1994; Tanaka et al., 1989; Xu 1991;
Xu 1997; Yang 2002). In the past three years, some novel modeling approaches to uncertainty or
data analyses have been developed. The fuzzy rule base is a knowledgebase that models human
cognitive factors. Chakraborty and Chakraborty (2008) developed a method of fuzzy linear and
fuzzy polynomial regression that utilized linguistic ‘IF-THEN’ rules. Bolotin (2007) proposed a
regression model that incorporated a robustness concept to deal with dichotomization of the
outcome by a single cut-off point in medical studies. This model was not sensitive to the
uncertainty arising from the cut-off point location techniques. Nasrabadi et al. (2007) proposed a
novel LP-based approach to the problem of detecting outliers in the data set during fuzzy
regression analysis. Huang et al. (2006) developed the fuzzy principal component regression
(FPCR) method to overcome the problem of multicollinearity in a fuzzy regression mode. In
addition to the above regression models which have successfully improved analysis using specific
data and subject, some approaches specifically concerned about the management and forecasting
of cash flow have also been discussed in previous work (see Hwee and Tiong 2002; Navon 1996).
Although fuzzy S-curve regression and working capital management have been widely studied,
project control models based on fuzzy regression models have not yet been applied to the
problem of cash management for construction firms. That is, the dimensions and complexity of
working capital management are so large that numerical data concerning the system information
can not be obtained exactly. Unfortunately, there have been few practical models or management
methods proposed to deal with the capital management issues faced by construction firms. The
aim of this study is to fill this gap by developing a practical regression model based on the
Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model that will enable construction firms in Taiwan to rationally
manage the amount of cash and current assets they possess for certain times of duration.
This rest of the paper is structured as follows. The first section contains a discussion of the
balance between the surplus and shortage of working capital, as well as the Miller-Orr model and
classic S-curve theory. The curve-fitting problems are solved by utilizing fuzzy set theory, fuzzy
74
balance. Any diversion from their target level incurs a penalty in the form of excess interest
payments. In contrast, the penalty for insufficient cash for debt payments would be the cost of
trading other assets for cash. Furthermore, if a firm has been drained of all current assets, then
they may incur an additional penalty or opportunity cost by arranging for a loan in a short amount
of time. Obviously, a balance must exist between the two extremes; see Fig. 1.
The popular Miller-Orr model can be used to help the construction firm find this balance, as
illustrated in Fig. 2 (for more details, see Juang 1994; Ross et al. 1995). The model argues that
the adjustment of irregular cash needs patterns that occur at various times is best handled through
the use of dual control limits. In other words, a firm sets its cash limit based upon its operating
characteristics and credit conditions. Similarly, the upper cash limit U and target cash balance C*
can be set based on transaction costs, variance of cash flow and the opportunity cost of holding
cash. Once the upper and lower thresholds have been identified a firm can determine their own
best timing for investing cash in marketable securities, or trading notes for cash. In short, the
Miller-Orr model simplifies working capital management into the task of finding the target cash
balance and the associated limits. The model states that
C* = L + (3/4 * F * σ2 / R)1/3 , (1)
where
U = 3 * C*-2 * L ; (2)
L: Lower cash limit;
F: Transaction costs of trading valuable notes for cash or arranging short-term loans;
σ2: Variance in cash flow;
R: Opportunity costs, equivalent to interest rates for loans or security notes.
Dual control limits can be handled using two variables, i.e., C* (target cash balance); and U
(upper limit). The company administrator must first configure the lower cash limit L. Basically,
this is a safety stock. The amount of stock depends on how much tolerance the company has for
the risk of cash shortage. Based on Eqs. (1-2), it can be seen that the target cash balance of the
construction firm can be permitted to fluctuate within certain bounds. If the cash balance is
76
S-curve model that can be used for capital management by construction firms. The proposed T-S
fuzzy model smoothly connects the fuzzy regression curve obtained for the control of large and
small-scale engineering projects.
4. Fuzzy S-curve via T-S Fuzzy Model
The T-S fuzzy model was developed by Takagi and Sugeno (1985) to represent nonlinear
relationships among multiple input and output data based on fuzzy reasoning. The resulting
overall fuzzy regression model, which is usually nonlinear, is achieved via the fuzzy blending of
each individual input-output realization (for more details, please see Chen et al., 2006 and Wang
et al. 1996).
The following polynomial equation can be utilized to construct the fuzzy regression model
using k-order curve fitting:
k
k xay . (4)
Nonlinear relations can be represented by choosing the order k. Parameters are determined so that
the distance (or error) between an observed data point and its corresponding point on the
polynomial is minimal.
In this study, the data clusters of cost are distributed into overlapping regions representing
the outlay for engineering construction jobs. These cost clusters are shown by the membership
functions of fuzzy sets C1, C2 … Ci as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, the ith rule of fuzzy inference
is described by a set of fuzzy IF-THEN rules which take the following form (Hsiao et al., 2005;
Pereira et al., 2008):
Rule 1: IF x is C1 THEN 111
k
k xay 
Rule 2: IF x is C2 THEN 222
k
k xay 
 ,
Rule 2: IF x is Ci THEN kiiki xay  , (5)
78
percentage (%); and T is the duration time (%).
To apply the S-curve model to project management and to understand the characteristics of
cash flow, the lower cash balance limit L=5%, and the target cash balance and the upper limit are
given by C* = L + 150(σ2 / R)1/3 and U = 2*C*L, respectively.
Figure 9 shows the assumed original cash flow model. The total time limit for a project is
divided into four regions, based on the long-term data variance with reference to different project
durations. The variation σ2, target cash balance C* and upper cash balance limit U are obtained
separately, and used to revise the cash flow. As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 10, the target cash
balance C* is about 9.3%, and three adjustments, comprised of one short-term loan and two
investments, occur within the project period.
To demonstrate the assumed model and the feasibility of the above results, we test project
data for three metro bids. The scales of projects A, B and C are 17.7, 53.4 and 38.3 billion, and
the durations are 7.5, 7.3 and 7.7 years, respectively. Next, the values of C*, U and L in each
region (obtained from Table 2) are employed to analyze the existing projects A, B and C,
producing the results illustrated in Figs. 11-14. These figures show high profits and few revisions
throughout the entire project, demonstrating that the model is effective. A more uniform
allocation of cash flow leads to more effective capital management and control. The number of
revision times and the monetary sums should both be low. Similarly, the availability decreases
when the variation of cash flow increases. That is, the proposed model indicates that large
numbers of revisions and large amounts of money are not advantageous for capital management.
6. Conclusions
In this investigation a fuzzy S-curve regression method is used to improve the
understanding of capital management. The aim of this study is to develop a practical model which
construction firms in Taiwan can use to use to ascertain the most efficacious amount of cash and
current assets they should possess in a particular time frame.

計畫成果自評
The objective of this project is to develop an efficient analysis algorithm on the practical
engineering data. In present outcome, the authors supplied valuable experiment data and
analytic method, which will be of great contribution to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics.
The results will illustrate well what has been investigated in laboratory experiment and may
be applicable to the naturally occurring reflection of internal waves from sloping bottoms.
More recently, it has been proposed that internal wave mixing may contribute significantly
to internal mixing in the ocean and hence has an important influence on world climatic
changes. Based on the statistical algorithm, regression model, optimal method and fuzzy
models, the reduction in internal wave energy can be predicted on a sloping bottom due to
frictional effect. Since interaction between internal waves and uniform slopes has occurred
in an estuary, a lake or in the ocean, the results in this project available would benefit future
project on internal wave hydrodynamics. Moreover, this project reviews the financial aspects
of managing a construction firm. We argue that financial management in a construction firm
is based mainly on its liquidity, which is most directly linked to short-term solvency.
Therefore, cash management is the most important factor in working capital management.
To understand cash management fully, the study incorporates the well-known Miller-Orr
concept of working capital management. A simplified case is also introduced to demonstrate
the concept and steps involved in applying the conceptual model. The proposed approach
undoubtedly has to be more rigorously verified and/or modified to improve its practical
usefulness in the construction industry. Nevertheless, as shown in the case study, the model

Abstract:-This study addresses a fuzzy Lyapunov method for the stability analysis of time-delay fuzzy
systems subject to external disturbances. The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model and parallel distributed
compensation (PDC) scheme are first employed to design a nonlinear fuzzy controller in order to
stabilize the time-delay fuzzy systems. According to the controlled system, the H infinity criterion is
derived based on the fuzzy Lyapunov method, which is defined in terms of fuzzy blending quadratic
Lyapunov functions. Based on the stability criterion, the time-delay fuzzy systems are guaranteed to be
stable.
Key-Words: - Fuzzy Lyapunov method, delay-dependent, T-S fuzzy systems.
1. Introduction
The Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) model was first
described by (Takagi and Sugeno, 1985). This
model can effectively represent complex
nonlinear systems using fuzzy sets, and then by
applying fuzzy reasoning to a set of linear
input-output submodels (Cao and Frank, 2001).
These fuzzy models represent local dynamics in
different state space regions with linear models.
The overall model of the system is attained by
the fuzzy “blending” ofthese fuzzy models.
Since they utilize linear models in the
consequent parts, traditional system theory
becomes straightforward for analysis. Various
controllers based on T-S fuzzy models have since
been presented (for example, see Cao et al., 1997;
Chen et al., 2004; K. Tanaka and Kosaki, 1997;
Tanaka and Sano, 1994 and the references
therein).
Linear matrix inequality (LMI) theory is a
new and rapidly growing field that provides a
helpful alternative to the analytical method (for
more details, see Boyd et al., 1994; Nesterov and
Nemirovsky, 1994). Many problems arising in
system and control theory can be reduced to a few
standard convex or quasiconvex optimization
problems involving the LMI. These resulting
optimization problems can be easily solved with
numerical computation, making LMI techniques
into highly efficient and practical tools for solving
complex control problems (Park et al., 2002).
Moreover, stability is an essential property of
control systems, and has been widely investigated
in literature on fuzzy dynamic systems (see Cao et
al., 1996; Chen, 2006; Chen et al., 1993; Cuesta et
al., 1999; Feng et al., 1997; Tanaka and Sugeno,
1992; Wang et al., 1996; Margaliot and Langholz,
2003 and the references therein).
The problem of the stabilization of
time-delay systems has been explored for several
years. Furthermore, engineering processes
commonly involve time delays, which frequently
arise in chemical processes and long
transmission lines in pneumatic, hydraulic and
rolling mill systems. The problem of stability
analysis of time-delay systems has been one of
the main concerns of research into the attributes
of such systems. Many monographs on this
subject have been published, such as Cao and
Frank, 2000; Cao and Frank, 2001; Hsiao et al.,

3. LMI Conditions
This section derives linear matrix inequality
(LMI) conditions using Lyapunov theory to verify
the stability of time-delay T-S fuzzy systems.
Considering an LMI 0)( xF , the LMI problem
is to find feasx such that 0)( feas xF , or
determine that the LMI is infeasible. This is a
convex feasibility problem and an LMI definition
is clear described in (Lu et al., 1998; Boyd et al.,
1994).
Before a typical stability condition for
time-delay T-S fuzzy system (5) is proposed, some
useful concepts are given below:

B nR and for any symmetric positive definite
matrix G nnR or R, we have

condition is considered.

where P are some positive definite matrices,
ft denotes the terminal time of the control, 

)(t on )(tx , and Q is a positive definite
weighting matrix.
Lemma 2 gives a sufficient condition for

stabilized, the robustness design is proposed to
overcome the modeling error. Delay-dependent
stability conditions of closed-loop controlled
systems are then derived based on fuzzy
Lyapunov functions to avoid conservatism.
