implement 2-D OCDMA configurations, there 
are some practical optical devices to achieve the 
functionalities such as array waveguide grating 
(AWG), tunable delay line, fiber Bragg grating 
(FBG),…etc, [2][3]. Several experiments have 
also demonstrated the performance of these 
systems [6][7]. 
As the 2-D OCDMA spreads the optical 
signature sequences into both time and 
wavelength simultaneously, the correlation 
properties of two-dimensional code sequence 
are significant in system performance. In 
general, out-of-phase autocorrelation and 
out-of-phase cross-correlation must be as small 
as possible. In the 2-D time-wavelength 
OCDMA systems, the signature sequences can 
be classified into two categories: single pulse 
per row and multi-pulse per row [10]. The 2-D 
time-wavelength code structure can be 
represented by a time-wavelength code matrix 
[4][5][10]. The number of columns stands for 
the length of the signature sequence (also, the 
number of time-slots), and the number of rows 
represents the code weight (also, the number of 
wavelengths).  There are different kinds of 
approaches to construct a 2-D time-wavelength 
signature sequences [4][5].  
If each wavelength occurs only “once” in the 
code matrix, the signature sequence is referred 
to as symmetric, or equivalently single pulse 
per-row [4][5][10]. Carrier-hopping prime code, 
prime hopping code, and some 
multi-wavelength optical orthogonal code 
(MWOOC) are this case [4][5]. The symmetric 
code has zero autocorrelation sidelobes and the 
cross-correlation function at most one. In this 
paper, we will employ carrier-hopping prime 
code [4] as signature sequence to analyze 
system performance.  
Run-length limited code (RLL) or line coding 
techniques are often utilized in magnetic or 
optical data storage system [11]-[13]. The 
transition probabilities for bit “1” and “0” in 
data storage system are different. This 
asymmetric property is similar to that of 
OCDMA system. Error correction capability is 
an important consideration in run-length limited 
code. Run-length limited code with trellis 
coding scheme is efficient for Viterbi algorithm, 
since its constraint length is short. Some error 
correctable run-length limited codes with trellis 
coding scheme have been discussed [11]-[14].  
The purpose of employing run-length limited 
code is to avoid a long consecutive bit “1” or 
“0” in transmission. There are two main reasons 
for this [13][14]. In the first place, run-length 
limited coding brings about the spectral null 
which will free from the low-frequency loss in 
signal’s power spectrum. In addition, run-length 
limited code is comprised of sufficient level 
transitions (i.e. with adequate timing 
information), thus receiver benefits for the 
self-synchronization. In this paper, we utilize 
the trellis run-length limited code for 
application, but extend it from one-dimension to 
two-dimension. Our proposed scheme can 
applied to more complicated structure to further 
enhance system performance. 
In OCDMA systems, multiple access 
interference (MAI) is the major degradation of 
system performance. It has been discussed that 
optical beat noise is also a deterioration factor 
that affect system performance significantly 
[8]-[10]. In this paper, aside from MAI and beat 
noise, thermal noise, shot noise, and relative 
intensity noise (RIN) are also taken into 
consideration.

In this project, we employ carrier-hoping prime 
code as signature sequence [2]-[4]. The

variances of thermal noise, shot noise, relative

As the two-dimensional trellis shown in Fig. 3, 
we can observe that there are four pairs of 
minimum distance error events with free 
distance 4. In binary symmetric channel, the bit 
error probability with even free distance can be 
lower bounded by [13]-[15]

However, in OCDMA system the error

transmitting bit 1 (i.e. 10 PP ≥ ). To simplify the 
calculation of bit error probability in our 
proposed scheme, without loss of generality, we 
consider the worst case, which takes P0 for p in 
(10).

The data rate is 100 Mbps, RIN=-120 dB/Hz,

both cases are nearly the same, which are 1313 
and 1314, respectively. This can illustrate the 
benefit of code flexibility and also to ensure a 
fair comparison [10]. The numerical results 
show that our coding scheme can further

Abstract—In this paper, the employment of two-dimensional run-
length limited code is investigated for time-spreading wavelength-
hopping optical CDMA systems. In the proposed architecture, 
the carrier-hopping prime code is utilized as signature sequences, 
and it is a symmetric code whose out of phase autocorrelation is 
zero and the cross-correlation is at most one. Based on the zero 
autocorrelation sidelobes property, we can apply the two-
dimensional ternary symbols to the trellis run-length limited code. 
To further enhance the free distance of the proposed trellis code, 
a coset representative is added to the codeword. The multiple 
access interference and beat noise are the most detrimental 
factors of system impairment. Apart from the multiple access 
interference and beat noise, some of the deteriorating impacts of 
system performance are also taken into consideration, which 
include thermal noise, shot noise, and relative intensity noise.

I. INTRODUCTION
Optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) 
techniques had been widely discussed for different applications 
such as local area network (LAN), fiber to the home (FTTH), 
multiprotocol label switching, and so on [1]-[12]. The 
advantages of OCDMA can be attributed to some aspects in 
terms of flexibility, low cost, physical layer security, 
asynchronous traffic and scalability [2].  
With the rapid progress of implementation of encoders and 
decoders [5]-[7], time-spreading wavelength-hopping (i.e. 2-D) 
OCDMA systems have been widely discussed [5]-[12]. The 2-
D OCDMA system is better than 1-D system in terms of 
carnality, multiple access interference (MAI), and number of 
simultaneous access users. The 2-D time-wavelength code 
structure can be represented by a time-wavelength code matrix 
[3][9][10], where the number of columns represents the length 
of the signature sequence (also, the number of time-slots) and 
the number of rows represents the code weight (also, the 
number of wavelengths). The signature sequences in the 2-D 
system can be classified into two types: single pulse per row 
and multiple pulses per row [9][10].  
If each wavelength occurs only “once” in the code matrix, 
the signature sequence is referred to as symmetric, or 
equivalently single pulse per-row [9][10]. Carrier-hopping 
prime code (CHP), prime hop code (PH), and Yu-Park (YP) are 
this case [9][10]. The symmetric code has zero autocorrelation 
sidelobes and the cross-correlation function at most one 
[3][9][10].  
The 2-D OCDMA spreads the optical signature sequences 
into both time and wavelength simultaneously. As the multiple 
access interference (MAI) poses adverse impact on system 
performance significantly, the design of signature sequence is 
an art work that will affect the correlation properties of the 
two-dimensional OCDMA systems. In this paper, carrier-
hopping prime code [3] is utilized as signature sequence to 
analyze system performance in the proposed system. 
To deploy the 2-D time-spreading wavelength-hopping 
OCDMA systems, the implementation of encoder and decoder 
is the basis for constructing 2-D OCDMA configurations. 
There are different kinds of approaches to accomplish the 
physical implementations, such as array waveguide grating 
(AWG), tunable delay line, fiber Bragg grating (FBG),…etc, 
[ˈ]ˀˮˊ˰. Several experiments and analyses have also 
demonstrated the performance of these systems [6][7]. 
Run-length limited codes (RLL) (i.e. (d, k) code) are often 
employed in digital transmission, magnetic, and optical data 
storage system  to avoid  a long consecutive bits “1” or “0” in 
transmission thus free from loss of synchronization [14]-[18]. 
The error correction capability is an important consideration in 
run-length limited code. Some of the error correctable run-
length limited code with block and trellis structures had been 
investigated [14]-[18].  
In this paper, the trellis run-length limited code with error 
correction capability is utilized, where the free distance is 4 
[14]. To further enlarge the free distance, a two-dimensional 
spatial coding scheme and a coset representative are imposed 
in the one-dimensional trellis. The proposed architecture can 
extend the free distance from 4 to 8, thus greatly enhances the 
system performance.    
It had been investigated that multiple access interference 
and optical beat noise are the major deteriorating factors in 
OCDMA systems [8]-[10]. In this paper, aside from MAI and 
beat noise, shot noise, thermal noise, and relative intensity 
noise (RIN) are also taken into account. This paper is organized 
as follows. System architecture is depicted in section II, where 
the employment of two-dimensional coding scheme and coset 
representative are presented. System performance using trellis-
coded scheme is analyzed in section III. Finally, the numerical 
results and discussions are given in section IV.

position. In Fig. 3, we can observe that there are four pairs of 
minimum distance error events each with free distance eight.  
III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this paper, the carrier-hopping prime code a(t) and its 
shifted version a’(t) are utilized as signature sequences. In the 
proposed two-state trellis, we can observe that the probabilities 
for transmitting bit 1 and 0 are 2/3 and 1/3, respectively. Based 
on the previous studies [8]-[10], the error probability for 
transmitting bit 1 and 0 under K number of simultaneous users 
can be represented, respectively, as

where p is the transition probability in binary symmetric 
channel, and m is the number of information bits at each 
node of the decoding trellis. 
However, in OCDMA system the error probability for 
transmitting bit 0 is different from transmitting bit 1. Without 
loss of generality, we take the average bit error probability 
(2/3)P1+(1/3)P0 for p in (10) to simplify the calculation of 
system performance in the proposed scheme.  
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
    The link parameters are the same as those in [8] (unless 
otherwise specified) given as follows. The data rate is 100 
Mbps, RIN=-120 dB/Hz, Pd=Pc=˄Ӵw, normalized threshold 
D=0.5. Also, for fair comparison to the proposed scheme, the 
convolutional code (i.e. C.C.) with constraint length L=2 (i.e. 
two-state) and code rate R=1/3 is employed in the analysis, 
which has maximum free distance 5 [16]-[18].  
To fairly compare the system performances on different 
schemes in OCDMA systems, the code sizes (i.e. wxN) can 
illustrate the benefit of code flexibility [10]. In Fig. 4, the 
carrier-hopping codes with different code weight and code 
length are utilized to present the improvement of the proposed

本計畫研究使用二維 RLL 碼應用於 time spreading wavelength hopping 光纖分碼多工系
統。吾人所使用的二維 RLL 碼乃基於空間編碼機制，此編碼方式可大大的提升系統效能。
我們使用載波跳頻質數碼及其 shifted version 作為展頻碼。基於展頻碼間的相互正交特
性，吾人提出一個 two-state 的籬柵式編碼架構。吾人所提之編碼架構，不僅簡單且能有
效的改善系統效能，亦可運用於更為複雜的籬柵式編碼系統。
