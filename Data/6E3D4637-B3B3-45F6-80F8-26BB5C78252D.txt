Abstract  
The diffusion-induced stresses in semiconductor 
materials during dopant doping-diffusion processes 
have been studied extensively over recent decades. The 
diffusion-induced stresses are built up by composition 
inhomogeneity during mass transfer, i.e., they are 
caused by concentration gradients. Chemical stresses 
created by concentration gradients during diffusion 
could also be large enough to cause dislocation 
generation. Dislocations created during processes can 
increase the effective diffusivity and solubility of the 
dopant and thereby cause overdoping. Their presence 
may alter electronic properties of the materials. Thus, 
diffusion induced dislocations should be avoided if 
possible during the doping of semiconductors. If the 
processes can be optimally controlled such that the 
homogeneity of the concentration can be satisfied 
within a short time, the diffusion-induced stresses can 
be reduced significantly. 
In this project, for semiconductor materials arsenic 
in silicon, a systematic analysis of the finite-difference 
formula will be constructed. And, the concentration 
distributions, direct problems, will be solved, thus, the 
diffusion-induced stresses will be calculated and 
analyzed. Then, an inverse modeling will be presented 
efficiently, the homogeneity of the concentration and 
the diffusion-induced stresses will be investigated. 
Finally, the fastest diffusion scheme during dopant 
doping-diffusion processes of semiconductor materials 
will be determined.

二、緣由與目的 
The diffusion-induced stresses in semiconductor 
materials during diffusion processes have been studied 
extensively over recent decades. The diffusion-induced 
stresses related to the dislocation density was studied in 
detail by Tuck [1]. Lee and Li [2] proposed that the 
most rapid diffusion processes occur without 
generation of dislocation. Menon et al. [3] studied the 
nonlinear diffusion in Cu-Au multilayer thin films. We 
investigated the nonlinear effect of the self-induced 
electric field on the diffusion-induced stresses in a thin 
plate [4] and in a long bar of square cross section 
[5]. 
 The diffusion-induced stresses are built up by 
composition inhomogeneity during mass transfer, i.e., 
they are caused by concentration gradients. The 
diffusion-induced stresses can cause dislocation 
generation which affects solute distribution and 
subsequent electronic properties [6]. According to 
Lee and Li [2], if the diffusion processes can be 
optimally controlled such that the homogeneity of the 
concentration can be satisfied within a short time, the 
diffusion-induced stresses can be reduced significantly. 
A non-linear optimal control algorithm was examined 
in obtaining homogenous concentration for the 
diffusion process of semiconductor materials by Huang 
and Li [7].  
To obtain uniform processing across the 
obtained estimates are not always numerically stable 
[10, 11]. Therefore, special methods must be applied to 
solve inverse problems. 
 
2. Inverse Problem Algorithm 
 The inverse problem in application to the present 
study is given concentration-distribution history across 
a thin plate to determine the applied unknown  
concentration, at outer surface, )(τα s  required for 
achieving homogenous concentration during processes. 
The given  concentration-distribution history is just 
our desired concentration trajectory required for 
homogeneity. Without loss of generality, we may 
assume that the applied unknown  concentration, at 
outer surface, )(τα s , is represented in the following 
series form in time domain [16]: 
)()(

τφτα j

jes ∑
=
=                 (9) 
where )(τφ j can be any non-singular function in the 
problem domain and  is a positive integer. J
The finite-difference method in the nonlinear 
diffusion model above at  is used to 
construct the following matrix equation : 
τττ Δ== mm
[ ]{ } { } [ ]{ }ϕθθ mmmm VF += −1 ,           (10) 
Then, the concentration distribution { }mθ  can be 
derived as follows: { } [ ] { } [ ] [ ]{ }[ ]{ } [ ]{ }ϕθ ϕθθ mmm

where  and [ ] [ ] 1−= mm FM [ ] [ ] [ mmm VFN 1−=

]. 
The vector { }1−mθ  contains  values of the initial 
distribution or the concentration distribution for the 
preceding time step. 
p
{ }ϕ  is the coefficient vector of 
)(τα s . The vector { }mV  contains the coefficients for 
the unknown { }ϕ .  
A time-sequential procedure was used to 
determine the unknown variables. The time domain was 
divided into analysis intervals of , 
where 
11 −+− ≤≤ rmm τττ
r  is the number of future time steps. The 
unknown parameters were determined for each analysis 
interval. For the next time step  we arrived at 1+m{ } [ ]{ } [ ]{ }[ ][ ]{ } [ ][[ ] { }ϕ θ

By same means, the concentration distribution at

, the estimated parameters {mττ = }ϕ had been 
evaluated and the task was then to determine the 
unknown concentration )(τα s . Thus, we were able to 
construct the following matrix equation { } { } { } 1)(1)( ××⋅×⋅ ΨΦ= ppprprϑ .          (14) 
After the known concentration distributions were 
substituted into vector ϑ , the unknown  variables 
could be found using the linear least-squares-error 
method. The inverse result was 
ϑTT ΦΦΦ=Ψ −1)( .            (15) 
This equation provides a sequential algorithm that 
can be used to estimate the unknown surface 
concentration required for achieving homogenous 
concentration by increasing the value of  by one for 
each time step. Thereafter, the dynamic surface 
concentration on the thin plate required for maintaining 
homogenous concentration during processing could be 
obtained. Then, the concentration distributions also 
could be calculated during processes. As the 
concentration distribution is obtained, one can proceed 
to find the diffusion-induced stress distributions. 
m
 In the present work, we assume the plastic 
deformation in the thin plate is small during the 
diffusion process and therefore consider only the elastic 
problem. The traction-free boundary conditions are 
adopted. By introducing the dimensionless stresses  
and the dimensionless variables, also assuming constant 
partial molal volume of solute and Young's modulus, 
now the diffusion-induced stresses inside the slab have 
 and  components only[2]. These are: 
∗
ijσ
∗
yyσ ∗zzσ
∫+−== ∗∗ 1021 dxzzyy αασσ              (16) 
It is noted that the dimensionless stresses   
are given by 
∗
ijσ
ij
S
ij ECV
v σσ )1(3 −=∗                      (17) 
where ijσ  are the dimensional stresses, V  is the 
partial molal volume of solute, E  is Young's modulus, 
and  is the Poisson ratio. v
Fig. 2 shows the controlled surface concentration 
by inverse algorithm. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show the inverse 
results of concentration distributions and stress 
distributions during processes. It is seen that the stress 
is largest at outer surface, and it is one at all times. If it 
is below the critical stress for dislocation generation, 
this controlled diffusion scheme should not cause 
dislocation generation inside the slab during 
processing.
