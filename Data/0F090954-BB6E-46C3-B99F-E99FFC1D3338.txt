Optimum Design, Fabrication, and Experimental Verification of 
Cantilevered Bio- and Chemical Sensors 
 
 
Abstract 
Microcantilever-based biosensors utilize 
micromachined cantilevers to detect the small 
mass changes due to affinity of analytes to 
their counterpart receptors. A biosensing 
cantilever with a higher frequency sensitivity 
will be able to identify a smaller mass variation, 
while a larger sensing area provides more 
opportunities for the receptors to react with the 
analytes. This research presents the optimum 
shape designs, with objective functions 
incorporating both the sensitivity and the 
amount of sensing area, for two basic shapes of 
biosensing cantilevers: a single beam with a 
constant cross section and a V-shaped beam. 
Numerical examples in this research have 
shown that the frequency sensitivities for the 
cantilevers with the optimum shapes are 
significantly improved for both types of 
cantilevers.

Preface 
This research was originally proposed as a 
two-year project: the first year would include 
analyses and optimum designs of cantilevered 
bio- and chemical sensors, and the second year 
the fabrication of biosensing cantilevers and 
experimental verification of the optimum 
designs. Since this project was granted support 
just for the first year, this report covers only 
the analyses and optimum shape designs of the 
biosensing cantilevers.   
Introduction 
 Bio- and chemical sensors can effectively 
detect the existence of microorganisms, virus, 
and chemical substances. The receptor layer 
coated on the sensors reacts with analytes or 
target molecules through a molecular or 
biomolecular recognition mechanism, and 
produces measurable signals by transduction 
(Fig. 1). Microcantilever-based biosensors are 
fabricated by micromachining and the 
functioning of such sensors relies on their 
mechanical motion or deformation (Fig. 2). 
Cantilevered biosensors have many advantages 
over conventional biosensing devices; they are 
faster, easier to use, less expensive, more 
sensitive, not requiring fluorescent labeling, 
and suitable for parallel measurements. 
Biosensors transform the stimuli 
(microorganisms, virus and DNA, etc.) into 
output signal through static or dynamic mode 
(resonance method). The resonance method 
utilizes the frequency shifting effect of a mass 
loading due to affinity of analytes to their 
counterpart receptors. Predictably, exploiting 
the same principle, a cantilevered sensor can 
also work as an ultra sensitive mass sensor.

Single Beam Cantilevers 
The outer shape of a single beam 
cantilever for biosensing can be defined by 
several geometrical control points. Fig. 6 
shows the outline of a cantilever that is 
described by straight lines connecting 12 
control points located on the boundary of the 
cantilever. Also shown in Fig. 6 is an area 
designated for optical laser reflection. The use 
of laser to detect the motion or vibration of the 
sensing cantilever is very common when the 
resonance method is used. Therefore, a laser 
reflection area should be preserved on the 
sensing surface of the beam for optical 
detection. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To design the shape of a microcantilever- 
based biosensor, both the frequency sensitivity 
and the sensing area are important. While a 
higher sensitivity can identify a small mass 
change (and therefore the existence of 
microorganisms) more easily, a larger area 
provides more opportunities for the receptors 
to react with the analytes. For biosensors using 
single beam cantilevers, the optimum shape 
design problem can be written as

where in the objective function (Eq. 1), fr is the 
rth resonance frequency of the cantilever; 
∂fr/∂m denotes the frequency sensitivity of the 
rth resonance frequency with respect to a mass 
variation; A is the total sensing area; α1 and α2 
represent two positive real numbers for scaling 
both terms to similar magnitudes; and β is a 
weighing factor between 0 and 1 for adjusting 
the relative contributions of the sensitivity and 
the sensing area. SL in Eq. 2 denotes the lower 
limit for the absolute sensitivity. The xi and yi 
in Eqs. 3 and 4 are the x and y coordinates 
(design variables) of the geometrical control 
points defining the shape of the cantilever, and 
the superscripts U and L denote the upper and 
lower bounds, respectively. Also, the total 
number of control points is symbolized by n. 
The finite element method can be used to 
extract the resonance frequencies of the 
cantilever and to approximate the frequency 
sensitivity and sensing area. If more than one 
mode are to be included in the design problem, 
the objective function can be rewritten as

where fi is the ith mode resonance frequency, 
and s is the number of modes included in the 
analysis. 
V-shaped Cantilevers 
The shape (or size) of a V-shaped sensing 
cantilever can be optimized by maximizing the 
same objective function defined in Equation 1 
with a different set of design variables while 
subjected to other geometrical constraints. The 
design variables for the cantilever, together 
with the geometrical constants, are defined as 
those shown in Fig. 7. The geometrical 
constants (C1 and C2) are necessary for 
reducing design variables (C1) and for 
preserving the laser reflection area (C2). 
Imposing geometrical constraints on the design 
variables to ensure the integrity of the 
optimized geometry and to prevent ill 
conditioning for the finite element analysis of 
the microstructure, the shape optimization 
problem can be formulated as follows:

To design the outer shape of the cantilever 
structure, six control points, whose initial 
coordinates are given in Table 1, are first 
defined. Assuming a symmetric structure, the 
other half of the area is defined by another six 
points that are mirror images of the control 
points and are symmetric to the y axis. The six 
x coordinates (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 and x6) of the 
control points are selected as the design 
variables, and the y coordinates are held 
constant through out the optimization process. 
By setting the weighing factor β=0.5 and 0.75, 
and setting various upper bounds for the first, 
second, and third mode frequency sensitivity, 
10 optimum design cases were examined 
(defined as Cases 1 through 10 in Table 2). 
After a series of analysis and optimization, all 
10 cases converged in several to 30 iterations, 
and the optimized results are listed in Table 3. 
The final shapes of the biosensing cantilever 
for all 10 cases are also shown in Fig. 10. 
Compared to -0.37, -1.61, and -2.32 Hz/fg for 
the first, second, and third mode sensitivity of 
the initial rectangular-shaped cantilever, 
respectively, the frequency sensitivities of the 
optimized shapes are significantly higher 
(negatively) for all 10 cases. Figure 11 shows 
the iteration histories of the 6 design 
parameters and the 2nd mode sensitivity for 
Case 7.

Result Summary 
The frequency sensitivity of a biosensing 
cantilever is defined as the change in frequency 
due to a change in the loading mass. When 
performing the optimum shape design for a 
microcantilever-based biosensor, both the 
frequency sensitivity and the sensing area are 
important. While a higher sensitivity can 
identify a small mass change more easily, a 
larger area provides more opportunities for the 
receptors to react with the analytes. This 
research has presented the shape optimization 
for two basic shapes of biosensing cantilevers: 
a single beam with a constant cross section and 
a V-shaped beam. Numerical results have 
shown that the frequency sensitivities of the 
optimum shapes were significantly enhanced 
for both types of cantilevers and an apparent 
trade-off between the sensitivity and the 
amount of the sensing area was also observed.  
Assessment of Project Results 
Since this project was granted support just 
for one year, this research included only the 
analyses and optimum shape designs of the 
biosensing cantilevers, which approximately 
covers the entire scope of the first year in the 
original proposal. The research results of this 
project has led to publications of papers 
presented in three different international 
conferences [9-11], and also a thesis for a 
Master’s degree [12]. Further results are also 
being collected for a manuscript prepared for 
submitting to an SCI journal.

concept was formed and iteratively solved. The optimization procedure modified the FE model material parameters and 
sought to minimize the difference between the analysis and the experimental results. For the L-shaped structures with the 
torsion mode data, the results converged to accurate Poisson’s ratio values. But for the symmetrical plate without torsion 
mode data, the procedure failed to produce an acceptable result. 
 
2. Finite Element Model Updating Technique for Identification of Mechanical Properties 
The finite element model updating procedure employed in this paper was proposed by the first author and applied to 
solve various problems in previous publications [10-12]. An error vector is first defined as a vector containing the relative 
differences between the experimental and FEA natural frequencies, and then a model updating problem can be defined as 
to minimize the length of the error vector as follows:

and n is the number of FE input parameters to be updated (updating parameters). The number of updating parameters 
should be kept small and only the uncertain ones should be selected as the updating parameters [6]. To form the relative 
differences, which constitute the elements of the error vector in Eq. (4), the test and the analysis natural frequencies have 
to be properly checked and correctly paired. The modal assurance criteria (MAC), which compare the similarity between 
two vectors, can be used to ensure that FE analysis and experimental modes are matched correctly, and are given as [13]

where eiψ  and ajψ  are the ith experimental and the jth FE mode shape vectors, respectively. The superscript H denotes the 
hermitian operator. According to Eq. (5), a MAC value can varies from 0 and 1 with the value of 1 representing the pairing 
of two identical modes and a smaller value a less similarity between two modes.  
The above optimization problem is solved to yield a set of updated parameters, and then the results are checked for 
convergence. If converged, the process can be stopped; otherwise, FEA is once again performed using the updated 
parameters to produce a new set of modal data leading to the next iteration, and the procedure is continued in an iterative 
way. To perform optimization, eigensensitivities with respect to changes in the updating parameters are calculated to 
direct the optimization path. The ANSYS finite element analysis software package [14] was adopted in this study to 
perform the FEA and optimization tasks. The first order optimization method of the design optimization module in 
ANSYS, which uses a forward difference approximation to calculate the eigensensitivities, was selected. 
 
3. Experimental Modal Testing of the Plate Structures 
In this research, three aluminum plate structures (Figure 1) were investigated. Figure 1(a) shows the geometry of the 
symmetric cantilever plate, while the L-shaped asymmetric plates (L-1 and L-2) are shown in Figure 1(b) and 1(c). All 
three structures have the same thickness of 1.95 mm. A modal testing experiment was performed on each of the plate 
structures, which were clamped by two steel blocks fastened together with a torque-adjustable screw driver to ensure a 
constant torque on the fastening bolts. The plate-block assembly was then rigidly fixed to a vibration isolation table. A 
vibration shaker (TIRA TV50018) was used to supply the excitation force to the plates and the induced vibration signal 
was recorded by a miniature accelerometer (PCB 352A21, weighed at 0.6 grams). Using the lightweight transducer 
minimizes the adverse effects of mass loading on the test structure. Both input and output signals were analyzed using 
B&K 3560C Pulse analyzer to create frequency response functions (FRF), which were subsequently evaluated by the 
Spectral Dynamics STAR 6.1 modal software to obtain the natural frequencies, damping, and mode shapes. The 
polynomial curve fitting method was selected to fit the measured FRF to extract the modal information. Figure 2 shows 
the test grids for all three plates. The excitation points, grid number 31 for all three, were intentional chosen to locate

4. Finite Element Analysis and Model Updating of the Plate Structures 
The finite element analysis for the aluminum plates was performed using the ANSYS software. The finite element models 
contained only shell elements (SHELL93), and the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and mass density were 67 GPa, 0.33 
and 2684 kg/m3, respectively. The FEA natural frequencies and mode shapes for the symmetric plate are compared with 
those from the modal testing in Figure 4. For this structure, other than those torsion modes that could not be measured, the 
natural frequencies and mode shapes are correlated very well. For the asymmetric plate L-1, all five modes including 
bending and torsion modes are very well matched, and their natural frequencies and mode shapes are compared in Figure 
5. Table 4 lists the MAC values for the L-1 cantilever plate. For the case of the asymmetric plate L-2, all ten modes 
including bending and torsion modes are also correlated quite well, and their first five natural frequencies and mode 
shapes are compared in Figure 6. Table 5 lists the MAC values for all ten modes of the L-1 cantilever plate. Note that the 
8th FEA mode is an in-plane mode, which is neither a bending nor a torsion mode. For asymmetric structures, bending and 
torsion modes are often coupled together depending on the degree of asymmetry. As the degree of asymmetry increases, it 
becomes more difficult to categorize the bending and torsion modes. However, this coupling phenomenon will not affect 
the FEA and model updating results.   
 In order to show the advantage of using the torsion modes of an asymmetric structure to extract its Poisson’s ratio or 
shear modulus, the Poisson’s ratio of the aluminum plates were deliberately set to 0.2 as an initial value, and then the FE 
model updating procedure was employed to determine the true Poisson’s ratio for the aluminum material. Three cases, 
each with only two modes, were defined: Case 1 used the first two bending modes (FEA modes 1 and 3) for the symmetric 
plate; Case 2 applied the first two torsion modes (FEA modes 2 and 5) for the asymmetric plate L-1; and Case 3 utilized 
the first two torsion modes (FEA modes 2 and 4) for the asymmetric plate L-2. After repeated iterations, all three cases 
converged. Figure 7(a) shows the iteration history of Poisson’s ratio for all three cases, and 7(b)-7(d) illustrate the 
iteration history of the frequency differences for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, respectively. It can be observed from the 
figure that both Cases 2 and 3 performed equally well in the determination of Poisson’s ratio which converged to the same 
value (about 0.334), and that Case 3 slightly outperformed Case 2 in frequency differences. The maximum difference in 
frequency for Cases 2 and 3 is less than 0.45%. On the other hand, for Case 1, the frequency difference is greater than 3%, 
and the erroneously converged Poisson’s ratio is about 0.255. It is simply inappropriate to use bending modes (Case 1) to 
identify the Poisson’s ratio or shear modulus.

Mechanical properties such as the Young’s modulus, shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio are important when the 
finite element method is used to analyze a micromachined structure. This paper presents a procedure based on the finite 
element model updating concept to determine the mechanical properties of micromachined structures, such as the 
Young’s modulus, shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio, utilizing multiple sets of resonance data from multiple structures. 
This procedure combines multiple sets of natural frequencies and mode shapes of the same microstructures, one from a 
vibration experiment (the resonance method) and the other from a finite element analysis, and forms an optimization 
problem that is subsequently solved to give the mechanical parameters. Contrasted to using a measured data set from a 
single microstructure, employing data sets from multiple microstructures produce a result with a better statistical property. 
Although this method can be applied to more complex structures, a commercially available silicon chip containing three 
micro-cantilever beams of different lengths used in an atomic force microscope for force calibration was chosen to 
demonstrate the proposed procedure. Resonance data of these three cantilevers were obtained using a commercial 
Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry system, which can measure resonant frequencies and mode shapes for up to 20 
MHz. The measured, first bending modes of the three cantilevers are between 19 kHz and 377 kHz. This example shows 
that the optimization procedure for identification of the mechanical properties of the cantilevers produced analysis results 
correlated more closely the experimental results and it confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

1. Introduction 
Mechanical properties such as the Young’s modulus, shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio are important when the finite 
element method (FEM) is used to analyze a micromachined structure. The Young’s modulus of a microstructure can be 
determined by either a static or dynamic test. The static methods include beam-bending testing and tension testing [1, 2]. 
The dynamic methods usually employ measured natural frequencies of a simple structure such as a cantilever beam and a 
simple analytical function relating the Young’s modulus of the microstructure and the frequencies [3-6]. The dynamic 
approach, however, is not suitable for more complex structures than the cantilever beam. For other not so simple 
structures, the analytical functions often do not exist and the finite element method should be used. The finite element 
method has been widely employed to simulate the static and dynamic behavior of microstructures, e.g. [7, 8]. Applying 
FEM to analyze a microstructure requires the mechanical properties of the structure as input parameters. A small error in 
one input parameter can produce large deviations from the true structural responses. To obtain a more accurate and 
reliable FE model for a structure, the FE model updating technique can be adopted to fine tune the model [9,10].  
An FE model updating procedure, which is combined with an optimization technique, often modifies the FE model 
and seeks to minimize the difference between the analysis and the experimental results. The updated FE model is regarded 
as a better model for future dynamic response predictions. The model updating concept can also be further applied to other 
areas. In a design modification problem, Lee et al. [11] applied an updating technique to elevate the vibration modes of an 
optical pickup actuator by changing the dimensions of some parts of the actuator. The mechanical properties of 
micromachined structures can also be identified using a similar procedure by integrating measured data. Chen et al. [12] 
proposed a procedure to identify material and geometrical parameters for microstructures using the concept of finite 
element model updating. The method utilized measured and finite element analysis (FEA) natural frequencies that were 
paired together according to their mode shapes, and it incorporated an optimization sequence that formulated the 
frequency differences as an error vector to be minimized. The current research was intended to modify the Chen’s method 
by including simultaneously multiple resonance data sets from several micromachined structures in the identification 
procedure. Utilizing multiple sets of resonance data can improve the statistical properties of the procedure. 
 This paper presents a procedure based on the FE model updating concept to determine the mechanical properties of 
micromachined structures utilizing multiple sets of resonance data from multiple structures. This procedure combines 
multiple sets of natural frequencies and mode shapes of the same microstructures, one from a vibration experiment (the 
resonance method) and the other from a finite element analysis, and forms an optimization problem that is subsequently 
solved to give the mechanical parameters. Contrasted to using a measured data set from a single microstructure,

improve as the number s increases. The number of updating parameters should be kept small and only the uncertain ones 
should be selected as the updating parameters. In general it is required that r ≤ s to ensure a physically meaningful result.  
 
3. The Example 
 
3.1 The Force Calibration Micro-cantilevers 
A set of commercial force calibration cantilevers (CLFC-MOBO, Veeco Instruments Inc., USA), made of silicon and 
used in an atomic force microscope (AFM), was selected to demonstrate the proposed procedure. The chip contains three 
micro-cantilevers with different lengths. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show SEM micrographs of a 3-D view and a top view, 
respectively, of the chip. The longest cantilever was named as Beam A, the medium length as Beam B, and the shortest as 
Beam C (Figure 2(b)). The length and width, along with thickness, of each micro-cantilever was measured using SEM 
(Figure 3). Using L, w and T to denote the length, width and thickness, respectively, of the beams, the sizes of the three 
cantilevers are listed in Table 1. All three cantilevers have similar widths, and exactly the same thickness.

3.3 The Identification Results 
Four cases using different FE models were investigated, including Beam A model, Beam B model, Beam C model, and 
Three-beam model. Applying the proposed identification procedure for all four cases produced converged results in just a 
few iterations. Figure 6 illustrates the iteration history of the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. The final mechanical 
properties for all four cases after the identification process are listed in Table 4. Since experimental errors are almost 
inevitable and there were only one or two modes measured for each single-beam model, measurement errors could 
significantly detour the identification results. By including more measured frequencies, the Three-beam model reduced 
(averaged out) the level of random noise and enhanced the statistical properties of the final outcome. Table 5 compares the 
FEA and experimental natural frequencies for the Three-beam model with the final mechanical properties. Significant 
reduction of relative errors has been achieved from the initial Three-beam model (Table 3). The FEA mode shapes for the 
final Three-beam model can be seen in Figure 7. Although the natural frequencies have changed quite considerably from 
the initial model, the sequence of the mode shapes is the same.
