better spectrum efficiency and need simple 
channel equalizer to mitigate multipath effect. 
Therefore, OFDMA has been chosen as the 
downlink transmission standard [1][2] in next 
generation wireless networks. But OFDM is 
very sensitive to frequency offset and high 
peak to average power ratio (PAPR) [2], [3] 
such that the cost of mobile station will be too 
high to commercialize [1]. For these reasons, 
the Third Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP) used single carrier/frequency division 
multiple access (SC-FDMA), also known as 
Discrete Fourier transformed (DFT) OFDM, 
instead of OFDMA as uplink transmission 
standard for long term evolution (LTE) [1] [2], 
[3]. 
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) 
communication technology has received 
significant recent attention due to the 
promising capacity gain when employing 
multiple transmit and receive antennas [4]. 
Information theoretic results show that MIMO 
systems can offer significant capacity gains 
over traditional single-input single-output 
(SISO) channels [5]. This capacity increase is 
enabled by the fact that the signals from each 
individual transmitter appear highly 
uncorrelated at each of the receive antennas in 
rich scattering wireless environments. The 
receiver can exploit these differences in 
spatial signatures to separate the signals 
originated from different transmit antennas. 
Many MIMO techniques have been proposed 
targeting at different scenarios in wireless 
communications. The Bell-Labs Layered 
Space Time (BLAST) system [6] is a layered 
space-time architecture originally proposed by 
Bell-Labs to achieve high data rate wireless 
transmissions. On the other hand, in 
Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) systems 
[7], the same information symbol stream is 
transmitted from different transmit antennas in 
appropriate manner to obtain transmit 
diversity. 
However, multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) 
[8] can leverage multiple users as spatially 
distributed transmission resources, at the cost 
of more complex signal processing. Thus, 
multiuser MIMO is also known as spatial 
division multiple access (SDMA). In 
comparison, conventional, or single-user 
MIMO (SU-MIMO) considers only the 
dimensions of multiple antennas for local 
mobile device. Multi-user MIMO algorithms 
are developed to enhance MIMO systems 
when the number of users is greater than one. 
Usually codebook based closed loop MIMO 
[2] which relies on the feedback of channel 
state information is used in the downlink. 
However, open loop MIMO such as STBC or 
SFBC is used in the uplink because of the 
asynchronism of mobile stations [9]. Iterative 
multiuser detection, also known as turbo 
multiuser detection [10] in communication 
systems according to the “turbo principle” has 
gained a lot of attention in recent research. 
The “turbo” multiuser receiver iterates 
between multiuser detector and channel 
decoder to achieve high performance with low 
complexity. The channel decoder and 
multiuser detector iterate soft information to 
cancel multiple access interference (MAI). 
In the literature, there are already several 
papers foucusing on the receiver design of 
MIMO SC-FDMA system. In [11], the PAPR 
and frame error rate performance of single 
user MIMO SC-FDMA system was 
investigated. The space frequency block code 
(SFBC) for MIMO SC-FDMA systems was 
presented in [12] and [13]. In [14], the authors 
proposed turbo equalization to improve the 
performance MIMO SC-FDMA system and

length longer than delay spread is inserted to 
avoid inter-symbol interference and signals 
are transmitted via the antennas.

In the following paragraphs, we will

here can be easily extended to detect other

1 j J≤ ≤ . 
 
3.2 Turbo Multi-user MIMO Receiver 
When MP NK< , traditional multi-user 
cancellation method cannot perfectly cancel 
the MAI between users. Therefore, we 
propose to utilize iterative or turbo principle 
that combines MMSE and MAP detection to 
perform multiuser detection.  In this 
approach, the MMSE multiuser detector 
utilizes the extrinsic information from MAP 
decoder to cancel the interference from other 
users to iteraively improve the receiver 
performance. 
Fig.4 is the block diagram of turbo 
multiuser receiver. The output of MMSE 
multiuser detector after de-interleaver is used 
as the a-priori information ( )( )Da bL s j in MAP 
decoder for 1 j J≤ ≤ and 1 b B≤ ≤ . The 
MAP decoder provides not only the source 
data estimate, but also the extrinsic 
information of all coded symbols, including 
information and parity bits. The extrinsic 
information from MAP decoder is denoted as 
( )( )De bL s j . After the interleaver in the 
receiver, the extrinsic information will be used 
as a prior information ( )( )Ea bL s j  for MMSE 
multiuser detector. That is, 
( ) ( )( ) ( )E Da b e bL s j L s j = Π     (23) 
With the a prior information, we can find 
expected values of each user’s coded data 
through the following equation

Here, we also consider the 2 2×  Alamouti

extended to other SFBC schemes. Let

and ( )b jη%  is defined as

where ( )b je is a zero vector except that 
( )b je  has value 1 corresponding to location 
of the bth signal of the jth user in the vector

which has all other users’ interferes being 
removed. That is,

acceptable performance. For the MU-MIMO 
SC/FDMA systems, we have proposed an 
iterative multiuser receiver employing the 
turbo principle. From our simulation results, 
the proposed iterative receivers can achieve 
acceptable performance within several 
iterations. For future research, the effect of 
channel estimation error because of Doppler 
Effect will be incorporated to really match the 
channels in mobile cellular networks.

AbstractThe performance of orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing/code-division multiple-access (OFDM/CDMA) sys-
tem is featured by the resistance to frequency selective fading
and the support of multiple user access. However, OFDM/CDMA
system suffers from multiple-access interference (MAI) and
doubly selective fading in highly mobile channel. Based on basis
expansion model (BEM), this paper proposes a receiver with time
domain channel shortening lter cascaded with one-tap frequency
domain equalizer for down-link multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) OFDM/CDMA system over doubly selective fading
channel. Simulation results show that the proposed receiver not
only suppresses multiple-access interference but also equalizes
the time and frequency selectivity.
I. INTRODUCTION
1Recently unprecedented demand for wireless data service
has been driven by at rate tariff and smart phones. Multiple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques is well known as
the key technology in future wireless system to increase
data rate and reliability [1]. Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing/Code Division Multiple Access (OFDM/CDMA)
system, which combines the advantages OFDM and CDMA,
can counteract frequency selective fading and support multiple
data rate service according to the demand of customers [2].
In high speed mobile radio systems, the channel cannot
be assumed to be static, but varies within an OFDM/CDMA
block. Hence, the orthogonality between the subcarriers is
destroyed, and inter-carrier interference (ICI) is induced. Mul-
tipath delay spread longer than the cyclic prex (CP) will
leads to inter-block interference (IBI) where traditional one-tap
frequency equalizer will not render acceptable performance.
In this paper, the doubly selective fading channel with delay
spread longer than the CP for MIMO OFDM/CDMA downlink
transmission is investigated. To solve the above-mentioned
issues, conventional block linear equalizers (BLE) [3] which
combine equalization and multiuser detection are too complex
to be realized because of the need to estimate real-time channel
response. In this paper, using the basis expansion model
(BEM) [4] to approximate the channel, an equalizer which
consists of a time varying nite impulse response (TV-FIR)
channel shortening lter cascaded with one-tap frequency-
domain equalizer (FEQ) is proposed. We extends the methods

Taiwan under Contract NSC99-2221-E-005-053.
and results in [5] and [6] to MIMO OFDM/CDMA downlink
transmission scenarios. The TV-FIR channel shortening lter
transforms the doubly selective channel into a frequency-
selective channel with a delay spread shorter than the length
of CP, such that the one-tap FEQ can effectively equalize the
distorted signals. Simulation results show that the proposed re-
ceiver still can effectively suppresses MAI and time-frequency
selectivity without the knowledge of exact channel impulse
response.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A. MIMO OFDM/CDMA System
The downlink of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
OFDM/CDMA system with Nt transmit antennas and Nr
receive antennas is shown in Fig. 1. At the transmitter, the
th user data symbol is spread by the spreading code c()
of length N . After summing all users' signals, the spread
signals are spatially multiplexed across Nt transmit antennas.
In each transmitter, the input chip sequence is OFDM modu-
lated by using an N -point inverse discrete Fourier transform
(IDFT). A cyclic prex (CP) of length v is inserted at the
beginning of each block. Denote b(t)k [i] as the spread symbol
transmitted on the k th subcarrier of the i th OFDM block
(k 2 f0; 1;    ; N 1g, with N the total number of subcarriers
in each OFDM block) at the t th transmit antenna. Then
the transmitted sequence x(t)[n] from the tth antenna can be
shown as:
x(t)[n] =

where i = bn=(N +v)c and m = n  i(N +v). Note that this
description includes the transmission of a CP of length v.
Assume the sampling period be T , which is equal to chip
duration. The baseband-equivalent of the doubly selective
channel from tth transmit antenna to the r th receive antenna
at time index n is denoted as g(r;t)[n;m]. The additive noise
at the r th receive antenna is r[t]. The received symbol at
the rth receive antenna at time index n is obtained as
y(r)[n] =

The channel shortening lter is to transform the doubly

where RA =subtrfARxAH ]g, R eB =subtrfeBR eBH ]g and
subtrfg splits the matrix up intoNN submatrix and replaces
each submatrix by its trace. To avoid the trivial solution (zero
vector w[i] and zero vector b[i]) when optimizing the cost
function with respect to w(u)[i] and b(u)[i] , the unit-energy
constraint (UEC) is considered for their better performance [8].
The unit-energy constraint optimization problem is as follows

eigmax(A) is the eigenvector corresponding to the maximum
eigenvalue of matrix A.
Since the channel has become a pure frequency selective
channel, a one-tap FEQ can be applied in the frequency
domain to recover the transmitted symbols. Dening eX(u)k [i]
as the estimate of the transmitted symbol on the kth subcarrier
for the uth transmit antenna of the ith OFDM/CDMA symbol
with 0  k < N . This estimate eX(u)k [i] is obtained by the
one-tap FEQ with lter weight 1=dk[i]

where F(k) is the kth row of the unitary fast Fourier

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
MIMO OFDM/CDMA systems with Nt = 2 transmit
antennas and Nr = 2 and 4 receive antennas are simulated.
Quadrature phase shifted keying (QPSK), Hadamard code
with N = 32 and 64 and CP length v = 3 are used in
the simulation. The channel is doubly selective fading with
exponentially decayed tap gain, L = 6 and the product of chip
period and maximal Doppler frequency are Tfmax = 1=16 and
1=32. The channel impulse responses of each tap are simulated
as independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables
according to Jakes' model and all paths are uncorrelated. The
BEM coefcients of the approximated channel are estimated
