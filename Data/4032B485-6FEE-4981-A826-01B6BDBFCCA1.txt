Abstract—In this project, Hatanaka’s criterion is 
applied to analyze the jump resonance phenomena of 
the neurocontrol systems. By Hatanaka’s criterion, 
the derived critical jump resonance curve can be 
determined from the describing function of the tanh(．) 
functions in the nonlinear neurocontroller. Then, the 
Nyquist locus of the linear plant in the neurocontrol 
system is plotted. If the Nyquist locus cross the 
enclosed region formatted by the critical resonance 
curve, we can judge the jump resonance may occur. 
Furthermore, Kharitonov theorem is applied into the 
jump resonance analysis when the plants are with 
uncertain interval parameters. The simulation results 
including MATLAB and PSPICE show the 
effectiveness of this extension application.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The jump resonance is a kind of discontinuous 
behavior, when the nonlinear systems are excited 
under periodic excitations such as sinusoidal inputs. 
When the input amplitude or frequency is smoothly 
changed, the discontinuous output’s amplitude 
changes may occur. The first systematic research in 
this field is started from [1]. In [1], the general 
conditions for the jump resonance occurrence are 
derived. In this method, the nonlinearities are with 
the real describing functions. Fukuma and 
Matsubara extended criteria to the more general 
cases for the nonlinearities with the complex 
describing functions in [2]. Lamba and Kavanagh 
derived  the criteria to the nonlinearities with the 
amplitude and frequency dependent complex 
describing functions in [3]. A new criterion [4] for 
various frequency response curves i.e. different 
jump resonances was proposed. In [5], authors 
introduced the concepts of resonant response surface, 
sea and land parts in the gain-frequency 
characteristics and the relative occurrence conditions 
for the jump resonance phenomena of three types.  
A frequency-domain evaluation of 
multiple-nonlinearity systems exhibiting the jump 
resonance responses is proposed in [6]. 
On the other hand, many researches focus on how 
to analyze the jump resonance and how to avoid this 
situation in the circuit designs including 
ferroresonant regulator circuits [7], feedback 
amplifier circuits [8], nonlinear active microwave 
circuits [9], and active filters [10]-[12]. The review 
paper on the nonlinear electrical systems and their 
applications was proposed in [13]. 
In this project, we will analyze jump resonance 
phenomena in the neurocontrol systems containing 
Static Neural Network (SNN) with  tanh( ． ) 
nonlinear functions [14]-[17]. It is important to 
guarantee no jump resonance in the neurocontrol 
systems, because the neuro-like nonlinearities with 
tanh( ． ) functions are common in biology and 
medicine applications. This original work will attract 
more researches toward this direction. As we known,

The region is enclosed by a circle for a specific E . 
The center and radius of a specific circle can be 
presented as the following two equations. [1]

X , and Y  can be plotted in the complex plane of 
( )G j , when E  is as the parameter. The curve is 
called the critical jump resonance curve (i.e. critical 
curve).  
If the locus of ( )G j  cross the enclosed region 
formatted by the critical jump curve, the jump 
resonance may occur. It should be noted the critical 
jump resonance curve is the envelop of all circles by 
(14) with E  as parameter.

where p  is the interval parameters and ( )N s  and

polynomials sN( )  and sD( ) , respectively. sN( )  
and sD( )  are defined as following:

B. Jump Resonance Investigation for the Uncertain 
Plants

0 0[ , ] [0.3, 1] b b
   . 
Before the simulation procedure, all Kharitonov 
systems should be incorporated into neurocontrol 
systems for checking the stability. In this example, 
we can only check four combinations in the 
Kharitonov systems. 
The simulation condition is the same as previous 
subsection. The templates of ( , )G s p  are drawn at 
every frequency with (20) and (21). They mean all 
loci of ( , )G s p  will be located in the templates at 
every specific frequency. All templates will form the 
Nyquist envelops. In Fig. 5, 2
100
s s is chosen and 
noted as “o”. The loci of 2
100
s s  are all located 
inside of the Nyquist templates. By Figs. 3a and 5, 
the jump resonance may occur, because all Nyquist 
templates in the interval parameters regions do cross 
the enclosed region formatted by the critical jump 
resonance curves. We still can predict the occurrence 
of the jump resonance in the neurocontrol system 
with the uncertain plant.   
C. Frequency Domain Verifications  
The frequency response of the neurocontrol system 
with 2
100( )G s
s s
   is shown in the Fig. 6. For 
demonstrating frequency responses, the amplitude of 
input sinusoidal signals is chosen one. The 
frequencies are ranged from 0.01 to 3.11 Hz with 
discrete interval 0.1 Hz by the digital simulations. 
The frequency is swept increasingly from 0.01 to 
3.11 Hz firstly. Then, the frequency is swept back. 
“*” and “ ” note the frequency responses respect 
to the increasing and decreasing frequencies, 
respectively. By Fig. 6, the jump resonance does 
occur in this design case. On the other hand, we can 
check the combinations in the Kharitonov systems 
too. 
D. Time Wave Verifications 
By the suggestion from [20], we can use the chirp 
signal as the input of the neurocontrol system. The 
suddenly changes do occur in the outputs. The 
simulation results with the increasing or decreasing 
chirp signal are shown in Figs, 7 and 8, respectively. 
The results do verify the prediction of the jump 
resonance phenomena.  
E. PSPIC Simulation Results 
 The PSPICE circuits with ABMs (including V1, 
E1 and tanh(．)) as shown in Fig.9 is considered to 
show effectiveness of this extension application in 
the practical engineering systems. The simulation 
results as shown in Figs. 10 and 11 are similar with 
Figs. 7 and 8 with MATLAB, respectively.  
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
This project has demonstrated that Hatanaka’s 
criterion can be applied to analyze the jump 
resonance phenomena of the neurocontrol systems 
with certain and uncertain plants, respectively. By 
the describing function of the nonlinear 
neurocontroller, the critical jump resonance curve 
could be determined. On the other hand, Nyquist 
locus and templates of the certain and uncertain 
plants do cross the critical jump resonance curve 
respectively, so the jump resonance may occur. The 
frequency response and time wave simulation results 
of the neurocontrol system have been applied to 
verify this jump resonance prediction. The 
MATLAB and PSPICE simulation results show this 
application is feasible. The neuro–like tanh( ‧ ) 
nonlinearity exists in the biology and medicine 
applications. It is possible to extend this analysis to 
the relative applications in these fields.
