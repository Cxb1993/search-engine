current, respectively. The expression 
PVPV dVdP / can be rewritten in terms of 
measurable quantities as PVPVPVPV VIdVdI //  . 
However, both perturbation, i.e. hill-climbing, 
and IncCond methods did not perform well in 
the rapidly varying atmospheric context. 
Therefore, improved versions (Simoes et al., 
1998; Wilamowski et al., 2002; Hiyama et al., 
1995) have also been proposed to upgrade the 
tracking performance.  
The algorithms mentioned above share the 
same idea of “searching for MPP”. Since PV 
exhibits nonlinear I-V characteristics, MPP is 
difficult to locate analytically. Another approach 
(Noguchi et al., 2002; Duru, 2006), referred to 
as either the proportional open-circuit voltage or 
the short-circuit current, is developed on the 
basis of the assumption that the voltage Vmpp 
and current Impp of MPP are related to the PV 
open-circuit voltage Voc and short-circuit 
current Isc in a proportional manner, respectively. 
However, the Vmpp estimated is seen only as an 
approximation to the true value of Vmpp and the 
proportional constant tends to vary if the PV 
module ages, that is, the performance degrades 
with time.  
With conversion efficiency subject to 
factors such as atmospheric conditions, ambient 
temperature, solar isolation, etc, a robust and 
well performed controller is requested to turn the 
solar energy into electricity. Accordingly, the 
system can be operated in a reliable and stable 
manner than provides the maximum power 
output constantly. Evaluated by numerical study 
(Battista et al., 2002), a variable structure 
control approach to building a PV conversion 
system was proposed with further study found 
by Fossas et al. and Tan et al. (Fossas et al., 
2002; Tan et al., 2002). These approaches 
require a reference current for the control law 
synthesis and may lead to a lack of robustness 
when in operation. Defining the sliding surface 
with care, a robust approach is gained and 
proposed by Kim (Kim, 2006, 2007). This 
approach overcomes the defects by variable 
structure control approach.  
In this paper, the system is modeled with an 
equivalent circuit of a solar cell, and the 
controller is designed in a combined fuzzy logic 
and sliding mode controller as a means to track 
MPP with a choice of a sliding function 
satisfying 0/  PVPV IP . It is an intelligent 
controller to tune the crucial gain constant in a 
variable structure control approach. 
Subsequently, the system is simulated with 
Matlab Simulink and implemented by a NI 
AD/DA device in combination with programs 
developed in Labview. With the simulation 
compared with the experiment, in the end it is 
concluded that a fuzzy sliding mode controller 
(FSMC) is able to achieve MPP output and has a 
better transient response than the sliding mode 
controller (SMC). 
 
2. Solar cell modeling 
A solar cell itself is essentially a PIN 
junction diode, by which the solar energy is 
turned into electricity. Illustrated in Fig. 1 is the 
equivalent circuit model, with the symbols 
tabulated in Table 1.

It follows from Eqs. (26) and (29) that 
0s , while in the case of U=1, two cases are 
required to be verified so as to ensure 0ss . 
Under 1eqU , the operation point lies on the 
left side of MPP, implying that 
0PVV and 0s . Accordingly, skU feq   is 
less than unity, a fact in contradiction to the 
assumption of 1U . Under 1eqU , it implies 
that 0s , and 0ss  is satisfied. It is hence 
concluded that 0ss  holds true for U=1.

In this case, the output voltage V0 exceeds 
Vpv, the solar cell output voltage. A combination 
of Eqs. (26) and (30) results in 0s , while two 
conditions must be examined to assure 0ss . 
In the case of 0eqU , the operation point falls 
to the right of MPP, implying that OPV VV   and 
0s . In other words, it is just as the solar cell is 
connected in series with the load, which is a 
contradiction to the assumption of U=0. On the 
condition that 0eqU  and 0 skU feq , it is 
seen that 0s , and thus 0ss holds true. The 
conclusion made is that 0ss  holds true for 
U=0. 
As previously addressed, there exist certain 
conditions required to reach the sliding mode 
control. Nevertheless, in the case of  eqU =0 or 
1, the system is saturated, a problem that can be 
overcome by an appropriate choice of  fk  
made as a way to stabilize the controller in the 
range of 10  U . To start with, sk f  is 
required to be less than unity. That is 
max

made fuzzy, the controller operated in the 
combined fuzzy and sliding mode reaches the 
control plane within a shorter period of time.

This study investigates the flow characteristics of electroosmotic flow in a 
microchannel with complex wavy surfaces. A general method of coordinate 
transformation is used to solve the governing equations describing the 
electroosmotic flow in the microchannel. Numerical simulations are performed to 
analyze the effects of wave amplitude on the electrical field, flow streamlines, and 
flow fields in the microchannel. The simulation results show that, compared to a 
traditional pressure-driven flow, flow recirculation is not developed in the 
electroosmotic flow in a microchannel with complex wavy surfaces. The 
simulations also show that the electrical field and velocity profiles change along 
the channel in the region of wavy surfaces. Non-flat velocity profiles are 
observed in different cross-sections of the channel in the region of wavy surfaces. 
Key words: electroosmotic flow, microchannel, wavy channel, numerical 
                   simulation 
Introduction 
Recent years have witnessed significant advances in the microfluidic fields and have 
seen the development of many lab-on-a-chips (LOCs) for application in a diverse range of 
fields, including biological and chemical analysis, drug delivery, DNA hybridization, and so 
on. In modern microfluidic systems, most sample flows are manipulated using electrokine-
tically-induced driving forces. The resulting electroosmotic flow (EOF) can be easily control-
led by adjusting the intensity of the electrical field applied at various points in the micro-
fluidic device. Importantly, the velocity profile of an EOF, in a microchannel with a constant 
cross-section area, is a plug-like form, which is different from the parabolic velocity profile in 
a pressure-driven flow (PDF). As micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technology 
continues to advance, EOF is emerging as a powerful alternative to conventional PDFs for 
microfluidic applications requiring a precise control of minute volumes of sample fluids. 
Therefore, fundamental understanding of fluid flow on electroosmotic flows is important to

In the present study, it is assumed that the EDL thickness is significantly smaller 
than the characteristic scale of the microchannel, and thus the flow characteristics within the 
EDL were modeled simply using Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity [11]. As a result, it is 
unnecessary to resolve the potential distribution within the EDL, and thus the computational 
complexity of the solution procedure is significantly reduced. The Helmholtz-Smoluchowski 
velocity can be modeled as [11]:

where meo = –ee0z/m is the electroosmotic mobility, e is the dielectric constant of the solution, 
e0 – the permittivity of a vacuum, and z – the zeta potential. Note that the electrokinetic body 
force term ( EF

) in eq. (2) can be neglected due to the assumption of a very thin EDL and the 
use of the Helmholtz-Smoluchowski velocity. The distribution of the electric potential in the 
microchannel is described by the following Laplace equation: 
 
                                                               0)(                                                              (4) 
 
where f is the electric potential and s is the electrical conductivity. Note that the electric field 
is equivalent to E = – Ñf.  
Non-dimensionalization process 
The governing equations given in eqs. (1), (2) and (4) can be non-dimensionalized 
using the following non-dimensional parameters:

Where Lc is the characteristic scale of the microchannel, Vr – the reference velocity, Pr – the 
reference pressure, z – the ionic valence, e – the elementary charge, kb – the Boltzmann 
constant, and T – the absolute temperature, and superscript * denotes a non-dimensional 
quantity. Note that the reference velocity is taken as Vr = Veo. 
Applying the non-dimensional quantities, the governing equations can be rewritten 
as:

Boundary conditions 
In this study, because the geometry structure presented in fig. 1 is symmetric, the 
computational domain is defined from a low surface to the center of the channel. In 
establishing the boundary conditions of the electrical potential for the simulation model 
shown in fig. 1, it is assumed that a constant electrical potential is applied to the inlet of the

of the externally-applied electric field is given as E = 20 V/cm, and the Reynolds number is 
specified as 1.0Re . 
Figure 2 plots the distribution 
of the electrical potential in the 
microchannel with complex wavy 
surfaces. It can be seen that the 
equi-potential lines are distorted 
as electrical potentials pass 
through the region of the wavy 
surface. A sparser equi-potential 
line is observed near the wave 
trough, and a denser equi-
potential line is observed near the 
wave crest. The trend of 
distribution on the electrical potential is more 
evident as the wave amplitude increases. 
Figure 3 further illustrates the strength of 
the electrical field along the wall surface. As 
described above, the strength of the electric 
field is greater near the wave crest and is 
weaker near the wave trough. The variation 
range of the electrical field strength increases 
when the wave amplitude is increased. In 
addition, it can be seen that the variation of 
the electrical field strength along the wavy 
surface is asymmetric because of the effect of 
the geometric configuration. The distribution 
of the electrical field affects the flow 
characteristics in the microchannel. 
Figure 4 illustrates the flow 
streamlines and velocity vectors 
for EOF within the micro-
channel with complex wavy 
surfaces. In EOF, an electro-
kinetic driving force is induced 
as a result of the interaction 
between the EDL potential and 
the externally-electric field. The 
driving force acts only on the 
fluid near the walls of the 
microchannel. The bulk fluid is 
dragged into motion via a momentum coupling effect, with the driven fluid near the 
microchannel walls. Therefore, it can be seen that the flow streamlines follow the profile of 
the wavy surface in the EOF. Furthermore, it is evident that no flow recirculations are formed 
in the trough regions between neighboring wave structures. The EOF behavior is quite 
different from that observed in PDF.

order to satisfy the principle of mass conservation, as shown in figs. 6(b) and (e). For the 
PDF, in the same cross-section, it can be seen that a slightly distorted parabolic velocity 
profile is observed as a result of the change in the inertia effect caused by the variation in the 
channel width. 
 
In the cross-section on the wave crest, because the largest electrical field strength is 
observed, the largest electroosmotic velocity near the surface is obtained. In order to satisfy 
the principle of mass conservation, a concave velocity profile is observed in this cross-section, 
as shown in figs, 6(c) and (f). In PDF, because of the smallest width of channel in the cross-
section, the largest velocity is obtained at the center of the channel in order to satisfy the 
principle of mass conservation. These flow phenomena described above are more evident 
when the wave amplitude is increased. Comparing the EOF with the PDF at the same cross-
section of the channel, it is observed that the variation range of velocity on EOF is smaller 
than that on PDF. In other words, the EOF velocity profiles are flatter than those generated in 
PDF. 
The above indicate results from fluid motion into an EOF in a microchannel with 
complex wavy surfaces. The results can be used to explain fluid behavior in microchannels 
with surface roughness in order to accurately operate the fluid, or can be utilized to design 
microfluidic devices (e. g. an enhancement in fluid mixing by complex wavy surfaces) and so 
on. 
Conclusions 
The present study conducted a numerical investigation into the characteristics of 2-D, 
steady-state electroosmotic flow in a microchannel with complex wavy surfaces. The effect of 
wave amplitude on the flow field, flow streamlines, and electrical field were investigated. The 
results from the electroosmotic flow were compared with traditional pressure-driven flow. The
