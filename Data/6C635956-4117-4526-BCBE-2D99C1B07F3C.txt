Abstract 
In this project, we propose a non-weighted load 
balanced fast local protection scheme for survivable 
IP networks. Unlike conventional shortest path 
based routing, we relax shortest path constraints in 
computing working and backup routes to achieve 
load balancing purposes. Once a failure occurs, 
those nodes adjacent to the failure point use their 
backup routing tables to achieve fast local failure 
recovery. Only the affected traffic is diverted to 
bypass a failure. The approach adopts failure set 
concept such that the proposed scheme can be used 
to handle various kinds of scenarios including single 
link, single node or even shared risk link group 
(SRLG) failure. We formulate this problem as a 
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to 
minimize the traffic load on the most congested link. 
Since this problem is not tractable by its NP-hard 
property, we further decompose it into several sub-
problems. Each sub-problem is solved optimally and 
the original problem is approximated by combining 
the solutions of those sub-problems. We perform 
experiments on benchmark networks and compare 
the proposed scheme to well-known schemes on 
survivability, path lengths and link load distribution 
for normal and rerouted states. Through numerical 
results and comparisons, we delineate that the 
proposed approach achieves a sub-optimal solution, 
which is profoundly to its high survivability and 
load balancing at the expense of slightly longer 
average path hop count. 
 
Key Words: IP fast reroute, load balance, 
network optimization. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Long packet delay and service interruption are 
unacceptable for QoS sensitive applications in IP 
networks. When a network failure occurs, the total 
problem is NP-hard, we further decompose it into 
several sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved 
optimally and the original problem is approximated 
by combining the solution of those solutions from 
the sub-problems.  
The remainder of this project is organized as 
follows. We first demonstrate the problem 
formulation in Section II. In Section III, we present 
the problem decomposition technique and solution 
procedures to the problem. In Section IV, we show 
the experimental results and makes performance 
comparisons to other well-known schemes. Finally, 
concluding remarks are made in Section V. 
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
We formulate the non-weighted load balanced fast 
local protection problem as a mixed integer linear 
programming (MILP) problem. Given a physical 
network topology and the demand volume for all 
source-destination pairs, compute the working and 
backup routing tables of each node for normal state 
and failure states. The objective is to minimize the 
weighted sum of the maximum load on the most 
congested link in each state.  
The used notations in the formulation are shown 
as follows, 
Given input constant values: 
L: set of links in the network. 
N: set of nodes in the network. 
S: set of network states. Here we denote s0 as 
normal (non-failure) state and si as the i-th 
failure state. 
Ns: set of nodes which are affected by failure 
state s. We call node i is an affected node in 
state s if node i cannot deliver packets via its 
normal next hop in state s (see Fig.1). 
sN : set of nodes which are unaffected in state s. 
sN = N \ sN . 
Ls: set of links which cannot be used in the state 
s (see Fig.1).  
in
nL : set of incoming links of node n. 
out
nL
: 
set of outgoing links of node n. 
M: a large enough number. 
ws: a given weight for state s. 
tn,d: demand volume for node pair (n,d). 
  
Decision variables: 
,
d
l sx : =1, if link l is used to transmit flow for 
packets with destination d in state s; = 0, 
otherwise.  
Routing tables are derived from this decision 
variable.

destination d in state s.

The objective function is to minimize the 
weighted sum of the most loaded link’s flow amount 
in each state. The weight of each state can be 
designated depending on the operator’s engineering 
purposes. If state k is considered to be the most 
important state, a largest wk is assigned to it to 
emphasize its importance. Constraint (1) requires 
that each node selects an outgoing link to forward 
packets for every destination d in the normal state 
(s0). Constraint (2) requires that each affected nodes 
selects an outgoing link to divert packets for 
destination d in the failure states. Constraint (3) is

the first column includes those potential failed links 
for node 1 and first row are destinations. Each entry 
means backup next hops. For example, node 1 uses 
next hop 2 to forward the packets with destination 2. 
When link (1,2) fails, node 1 uses next hop 3 to 
divert the packets with destination 2.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The proposed algorithm can be applied to handling 
other scenarios such as node failure and even shared 
risk link group failure. In our experiments, we 
consider the most often encountered failure scenario 
[12]: single link failure. The NLB algorithm is 
implemented by LINGO 8.0 software on a PC 
running Windows XP with a 2.53 GHz CPU. We set 
the weight of normal state 
0s
u as 10 and each reroute 
state’s weight 
is
u  as 1. Since we consider single link 
failure protection, each reroute state corresponding 
to a single link failure. 
We perform three sets of experiments. First, we 
perform ECMP [3], LFA [4], LFA-SA, and NLB to 
observe the survivability under three benchmark 
networks: COST239, NSF and GTE. Each link 
consists of two opposite directional links. These 
benchmark networks are shown in Fig. 4. The 
computation of survivablity is defined as total 
number of successfully rerouted routes / total 
number of affected routes, where the former is the 
total number of affected routes that can be 
successfully rerouted to destination and the latter is 
the total number routes going through the failed link. 
A route here is regarded as an IP packet stream for a 
source-destination pair.  
 We randomly set link weights to be an integer 
within the range [0,100]. In LFA-SA scheme, we 
apply simulated annealing algorithm to tune the link 
weights until the highest survivability arrived. For 
ECMP, each link weight is set to be 1 to increase the 
chance of multiple equal cost paths between router 
pairs.  
Secondly, we evaluate all single link failure cases 
to compute average path hop count. We perform 
OSPF and the proposed NLB algorithm to observe 
the average hop count for both normal state and 
reroute states in each network. The computation of 
average hop count is defined as sum of hop counts of 
overall paths / total number of paths. Note that we 
set link weight to be 1 for each link in OSPF such 
that all routing paths have minimum hop count.  
In the final set of experiments, we compare NLB 
and OSPF to observe the link load distribution. We 
assume the traffic demand between any two nodes is 
10 Mb/s. The loading of each link is observed in 
normal state and the load of the most congested link 
is observed for each reroute state.

of NLB is inferior to OSPF. It is because that NLB 
requires to minimize the total link load to guarantee 
100% survivability and limits only the nodes 
adjacent to failure can divert the packets carried on 
failed link. It is unlike OSPF that can always re-
deploy overall routes through routing table updates. 
Moreover, a network with lower average node 
degree would result in the nodes adjacent to the 
failure having lesser alternate ports to provide 
packet rerouting.  
V. CONCLUSION 
In this project, we proposed a non-weighted load 
balanced (NLB) fast local protection scheme for 
survivable IP networks. This scheme relaxes 
conventional shortest path based routing to achieve 
load balanced traffic engineering. We have 
formulated the NLB problem as a mixed integer 
programming problem and proposed an efficient 
algorithm to obtain sub-optimal solution via 
problem decomposition. The model can be applied 
to protecting various kinds of scenarios including 
link, node, or even SRLG failures. A performance 
study delineated that the proposed scheme achieves 
balance among survivability, load balancing, and 
path lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that 
our proposed scheme has higher survivability than 
ECMP and LFA with the cost of slightly increase of 
mean hop count compared to shortest path based 
OSPF routing. The results also indicates that the 
proposed scheme achieves more uniform load 
utilization on the network bandwidth usage.

   Abstract—In this paper, we propose a non-weighted load 
balanced fast local protection scheme for survivable IP 
networks. Unlike conventional shortest path based routing, we 
relax shortest path constraints in computing working and 
backup routes to achieve load balancing purposes. Once a 
failure occurs, only the nodes adjacent to a failure look up their 
backup routing table to achieve fast local failure recovery.  
Only the affected traffic is diverted to bypass a failure. The 
approach adopts failure set concept such that the proposed 
scheme can be used to handle various kinds of scenarios 
including single link, single node or even shared risk link 
group (SRLG) failure. We formulate this problem as a mixed 
integer linear programming (MILP) in which the traffic load on 
the most congested link is to be minimized. Since this problem 
is not tractable by its NP-hard property, we further decompose 
it into several sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved 
optimally and the original problem is approximated by 
combining the solutions of those sub-problems. We perform 
experiments on several benchmark networks and compare the 
proposed scheme to well-known schemes on survivability, path 
lengths and link load distribution for normal and rerouted 
states. Through numerical results and comparisons, we 
delineate that the proposed approach achieves a sub-optimal 
solution, which is profoundly to its high survivability and load 
balancing at the expense of slightly longer average path hop 
count.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Long packet delay and service interruption are unacceptable 
for QoS sensitive applications in IP networks. When a network 
failure occurs, the total recovery time for current link state 
routing protocols (such as OSPF [1]) may take up to tens of 
seconds to re-converge [2]. To mitigate the impact of failures, 
many IP fast local recovery schemes have been proposed in 
literature. The main design principle is to pre-compute backup 
routes to bypass failed component and guarantee no transient 
loops during failure recovery. They can be classified into three 
categories: loop-free alternate based (LFA-based) schemes [3-
5], tunneling based (Tunnel-based) schemes [6-7] and backup 
routing table based (BRT-based) schemes [8-10]. 
In LFA-based schemes, for avoiding frequent route flipping 
in the failure recovery duration, the routers adjacent to the 
failed link suppress failure information flooding when they 
detect a failure. Affected packets are forwarded to a pre-
determined neighboring node so that these packets can be 
rerouted to their destinations without traversing the failed link. 
The pre-determined neighbors have to ensure satisfying loop-
free property. ECMP [3], LFA [4], and U-Turns [5] are belong 
to such kind of schemes. However, these approaches may have 
lower survivability if the routers have no alternate loop-free 
neighbors to response to a failure. 
In Tunnel-based schemes, when a router detects the adjacent 
link failure, it selects an intermediate router and encapsulates 
packets to bypass the failed link. Once the intermediate router 
receives these encapsulated packets, it decapsulates those 
packets and forwards them according to corresponding 
destinations via normal routes. The intermediate router must be 
selected carefully to avoid routing loops. Tunnels [6] and Not-
via address [7] adopt such design concept. To encapsulate and 
decapsulate packets would introduce extra burden on routers in 
the network. 
In BRT-based recovery schemes, each router pre-compute 
backup routing tables (or backup configurations) before any 
failure occurs. Protection switching to backup paths is 
triggered by inserting a configuration mark to packets for the 
scheme proposed in [8]. In [9-10], the protection is triggered 
when a packet comes in a router through a port that is usually 
not used for that packet. However, they did not consider load 
balance. The rerouted traffic would cause congestion or 
overload on some heavy loaded links.  
To our best knowledge, [11] is the first one to consider load 
balance in IP fast failure recovery. During a failure, the routers 
adjacent to failure device distribute the affected traffic over 
multiple backup paths through solving a linear programming 
problem incrementally. But, the subsequently linear 
programming iterations would lead to the migration of routes. 
The instable routes may cause other failures or even more 
packet losses. 
In IP networks, packets routes are determined by the routing 
tables in the nodes along the routing paths. Usually, a routing 
path is a shortest path with respect to the link metric. However, 
one can relax the shortest path routing if the routing tables are 
constructed without generating loops. Such concept has been 
applied in IP fast protection schemes such as [8-10]. In this 
paper, we refer to those schemes as non-weighted IP routing. 
The scheme proposed in this paper is also a non-weighted one. 
The major difference between the proposed scheme and the 
non-weighted protection schemes in the literature is that they 
only apply non-weighted in construction backup paths. That is 
their working paths still follow shortest path routing. In this 
paper, we further relax the shortest path routing constraint to 
objective function with Constraints (1-3), each path is 
guaranteed to be loop-free. Constraint (4) states that a link l 
can be used to carry flows for destination d in state s only if 
,
d
l sx =1. Constraint (5) requires ,
d
l sx  is a binary variable. 
Constraint (6) limits d slsx , = 0 if link l is the failed link in state s. 
Constraint (7) requires that a node still uses the same outgoing 
link used in the normal state to forward traffic in the failure 
state if the node is a unaffected node for the failure state. This 
constraint makes our scheme to be local recovery. Only the 
router adjacent to a failure needs to react. The last constraint, 
Constraint (8), is to find the most loaded link for each state s. 
Even though this problem can be entirely formulated as the 
above MILP model, the solution is still hard to be obtained 
since a huge number of decision variables. Due to intractable 
of this problem, it is unlikely to obtain an exact solution for 
realistic networks in reasonable computation time. For this 
reason, we present a low complexity scheme to find a 
suboptimal solution to Problem (IP) in the next section. In the 
sequel, we call the algorithm for the Non-Weighted Load 
Balance Problem as NLB algorithm for short. 
III. PROPOSED SCHEME  
To reduce computation time, we decompose the above IP 
model into |d| sub-problems, one for each destination node. We 
give orders to the |d| sub-problems according to their demand 
volume (i.e.,  }{\ ,dNn dnt ) in descending order, and call the first 
sub-problem as IPsub 1, the second one as IPsub 2, …, and the 
last one as IPsub |d|. The algorithm then solves all of the |d| sub-
problems sequentially according to their order.   
For Sub-problem IPsub k (denote its corresponding 
destination node is k), constraint (9) to constraint (15) is 
corresponding to constraint (1) to constraint (7) in Problem IP.  
In constraint (16), zl,s is the accumulated total used capacity 
before IPsub k is computed. It is calculated in line 6 of NLB 
algorithm. Figure 2 depicts the complete NLB algorithm. 
NLB Algorithm:  
1. Sorting demand volume for each destination node k in 
descending order and putting their node ID in priority 
queue Q. 
2. Set i = 1; slz , =0; 
3. While i  |d|   
4.      k = Q[i]; /*DeQueue the highest order call from Q*/
5.     Solve Sub-problem IPsub k; 
6.     Calculate k slslsl yzz ,,,  ; 
7.     i = i + 1; 
8. End 
9. Output working and backup routing tables. 
Fig. 2. The pseudo code for NLB algorithm. 
The NLB algorithm terminates when all sub-problmes were 
solved. We obtain the overall working and backup routing 
tables for each node for every destination for all states. In Fig. 
3, we give an example and show the computational results of 
NLB. 
 In Fig. 3(a), we give an example for using NLB algorithm 
to address single link failure problem. The used traffic matrix 
is shown in Fig. 3(b). The traffic matrix (i, j) denotes the 
demand volume originated from node i to destined node j. 
Each link is labeled with its load obtained from NLB in the 
normal state. Figure 3(c) and 3(d) present the computed 
working and backup routing table at node 1. In working 
routing table (Fig. 3(c)), the “Dest” means destination and 
“NH” means next hop. In backup routing table (Fig. 3(d)), the 
first column includes those potential failed links for node 1 and 
first row are destinations. Each entry means backup next hops. 
For example, in the normal state, node 1 uses next hop 2 to 
forward the packets with destination 2 by working routing 
table. When link (1,2) fails, node 1 uses next hop 3 to divert 
the packets with destination 2 by backup routing table. 
Fig. 3. An example for illustration of NLB algorithm. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The proposed algorithm can be applied to handle other 
scenarios such as node failure protection and even shared risk 
link group failure protection. In our experiments, we consider 
the most often encountered failure scenario [12]; i.e., single 
link failure. The NLB algorithm is implemented by LINGO 8.0 
software on a PC running Windows XP with a 2.53 GHz CPU.

Unlike OSPF can always re-deploy overall routes through 
routing table update. Moreover, the average node degree of 
NSF network is 3 (=42/14). A network with lower average 
node degree causes the nodes adjacent to failure having lesser 
alternate ports for packet rerouting.  
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed a non-weighted load balanced 
(NLB) fast local protection scheme for survivable IP networks. 
This scheme relaxes conventional shortest path based routing 
to achieve load balancing traffic engineering purposes. We 
have resolved the NLB problem via a mixed integer 
programming formulation and using an efficient algorithm to 
obtain sub-optimal solution on the decomposed problem. The 
model can be applied to various kind of failure proteciton 
scenarios including link, node, or even SRLG failures. A 
performance study delineated that the performance trade-off 
among survivability, load balancing, and path lenghts can be 
balanced in the proposed scheme. Experimental results 
demonstrate that our proposed scheme has higher survivability 
than ECMP and LFA with the cost of slightly increase of mean 
hop count compared to shortest path based OSPF routing. The 
results also indicates that the proposed scheme arrives more 
uniform load utilization on network bandwidth usage.
