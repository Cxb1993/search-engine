on pHEMT using surface and gate engineering 
techniques simultaneously. 
 
II. Experimental details 
The metal-organic chemical vapor deposition 
(MOCVD) growth of the pHEMT was done on 
undoped semi-insulating <100> GaAs substrates. 
From the substrate up, a 2000 Å of undoped 
GaAs buffer layer is succeeded by an 
Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs superlattice layer, a 1000 Å 
of Al0.22Ga0.78As layer, a bottom δ-doped layer 
(δ1=1x1012 cm-2), a 50 Å -thick GaAs spacer 
layer, a 125-Å-thick In0.22Ga0.78As channel, a 50 
Å-thick GaAs spacer layer, a top δ-doped layer 
(δ2=3.5x1012 cm-2), a 50 Å-thick GaAs spacer 
layer, and a 400- Å  insulator layer of 
Al0.22Ga0.78As. The final layer is 150 Å  of 
n+-GaAs (n~1x1019 cm-3) to facilitate formation 
of ohmic contacts and to provide low 
gate-to-source and gate-to-drain resistance. 
Following removing the n+-GaAs cap layer, 
the sample is cleaved in separated pieces in order 
to compare the effects of different passivation 
times. This information is of critical importance 
since the Schottky gate is placed directly on the 
AlGaAs surface exposed by wet etching. The 
passivation procedure was as follows: the sample 
was dipped in the ammonia-polysulfide 
[(NH4)2SX, 5%] solution for various times at 
room temperature, then rinsed in acetone solvent. 
Control devices without passivation were 
processed simultaneously to provide comparison. 
For Pt/Au gate pHEMT, gates were formed by 
evaporation and liftoff in acetone, with a 
metallization consisting of Pt followed by Au. 
Transistors with gate lengths of 1-μm were 
fabricated using standard UV photolithography. 
The atomic composition of the near-surface 
region of the undoped AlGaAs layer exposed by 
etching of the GaAs cap layer was examined by 
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Finally, 
changes in the surface chemistry of the exposed 
AlGaAs after sulfur treatment have been 
monitored again by x-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy.  
 
III. Device results and discussion 
First, surface quality for the presented 
devices was studied by using atomic force 
microscope (AFM). It is of interest to note that 
the smallest RMS roughness of 4.03 Å  is 
achieved after a 10 min sulphide treatment. 
Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c) show XPS survey 
spectra from the AlGaAs surface without and 
with 10 min sulfur treatments. In Figs. 1(a) and 
(b) the surface native oxide peaks, located at 
higher binding energies, are indicated by arrows. 
Especially, in Fig. 1(a) the broad peak in the 
24-26.5 eV results from O 2s. Eminently, these 
oxides or O are removed by S treatment. 
Furthermore, an inspection of Fig. 1(c) shows 
that O binds weakly on the AlGaAs surface in 
the (NH4)2SX-treated case. No further changes in 
the core levels are found for surfaces treated by 
for more than 10 min. From the above results 
investigated by AFM and XPS, 10 min sulfur 
treatment is accordingly adopted for device 
passivation. 
This study also presents the DC and 
high-frequency characteristics of 
AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs pHEMTs with four 
different types of gates: (a) an unpassivated and 
Au gate pHEMT, (b) an passivated and Au gate 
pHEMT, (c) an unpassivated and Pt/Au gate 
pHEMT, and (d) an passivated and Pt/Au gate 
pHEMT. Figure 2 shows the drain-source 
current IDS vs. drain-source voltage VDS of the 
Pt/Au gate pHEMT with sulfur treatment for a 
series of gate voltages. The device demonstrates 
very low output conductance and marvelous 
pinchoff characteristics as shown in the device 
I-V characteristics in Fig. 2. Figure 3 depicts the 
drain current and extracted extrinsic 
transconductance (gm,ext) versus gate voltage at 3 
V of drain bias. The experimental data on 300 K 
operation of the proposed pHEMT with 1-μm 
gate length exhibits an extrinsic 
transconductance of 249 mS/mm and a 
maximum drain current (IDS,max) of 329.4 
mA/mm. At 300 K, the extrinsic 
transconductance decreases at higher gate biases, 
but does not fall below 230 mS/mm up to 0.5 
VGS. At high ID, ID is found to decrease with 
increasing temperature for a constant VG, but at 
low ID the opposite is observed. This is evident 
from Figs. 2 and 3. This can be interpreted in the 
 4
toward the drain electrode. The fmax values are 
15.42, 51.5, 62.24, and 72.23 GHz at VDS=2, 3, 4, 
and 5 V, respectively, at 300 K. Also shown in 
Fig. 7 is the chuck temperature dependence of 
the fT and fmax for the passivated pHEMT with 
the Pt/Au gate. The inset of Fig. 7 shows the 
temperature dependence of the fmax/fT ratio. The 
exceptionally high fmax/fT-ratio of 3.95 at 300 K 
is attainable. At cryogenic temperature, the 
fmax/fT-ratio is only marginally influenced by 
temperature. When the chuck temperature is over 
300 K, the fmax/fT values show a gradual decrease. 
Up to 400 K this ratio is reduced to 3.5 (which is 
still sterling), the principal reason is the 
extremely low output conductance, which is 
chiefly related to the buffer layer. 
Figure 8 depicts minimum noise figure 
(NFmin) and associated power gain (Ga) versus 
frequency of the Pt/Au gate and passivated 
pHEMT, where the device is biased at VDS=2.5 
V and VGS=-0.5 V. An NFmin of 0.7 dB and a Ga 
of 16.45 dB are measured at 2.4 GHz. 
Table I shows a typical device data-sheet 
taken at room temperature for the four proposed 
AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs pHEMTs. These four 
different gate formation technologies are applied 
and compared on AlGaAs/InGaAs pHEMTs. 
The passivated pHEMT with a Pt/Au gate 
electrode shows a significant improvement in 
DC and high-frequency characteristics over the 
other three pHEMTs studied here of the same 
device structure. The device with Pt/Au gate 
alloy and sulfur passivation has the highest gm,ext 
among all the tested devices. As is evident from 
these results, the barrier heights of the studied 
metals rise as the device is passivated. Likewise, 
from this study, Pt/Au appears to be the better 
choice for the use as a gate metal in 
AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs pHEMT in a 
consequence of its large Schottky barrier height. 
The high breakdown voltage capability can be 
attributed in part to the high quality of the 
enhanced barrier height contacts and in part to 
the extended passivation over the source-to-drain 
area of the device. A noteworthy feature of the 
characteristic of the passivated pHEMT with 
sulfur passivation is the significant increase in 
fmax. The Pt/Au gate pHEMT exhibits a 55.6% 
improvement in gm,ext , a 0.12 V increase in Von, a 
11.2 V increase in BVGD, a 0.17 eV increase in 
BΦ , a 46.4% improvement in fT, a 129.3% 
improvement in fmax, and a 0.17 dB reduction in 
NFmin compared with Au gate pHEMT without 
passivation. The proposed devices demonstrate 
the potential of barrier height enhancement and 
performance improvement in developing simple 
and cost-effective gate technology for 
high-quality discrete and monolithically 
integrated FETs. For these devices, fmax values at 
least twice as high as fT is attainable. Notably, 
the Pt/Au gate pHEMt with passivation exhibits 
a high fmax/fT=3.95, as opposed to only 2.52 for 
the Au gate pHEMtT without passivation. Our 
results do serve to demonstrate the ultimate 
performance capabilities for 1-μm gate length 
pHEMTs fabricated on GaAs substrates. 
The large-bandgap AlGaAs material 
underneath the gate improves the gate-drain 
breakdown voltage without compromising the 
maximum drain current density of the device. 
Further performance improvements can be 
achieved when the gate barrier height can be 
increased to reduce the gate leakage current. 
Consequently, two-terminal breakdown voltages 
are measured for the four sets of pHEMT 
devices. In these measurements, the source is 
grounded and the drain is opened circuited. The 
Schottky contact metals studied are Au and 
Pt/Au. The gate voltage is swept until a reverse 
current of 1 mA/mm is established between gate 
and drain. The turn-on voltage and reverse 
breakdown voltage are monitored. The Pt/Au 
gate pHEMT with passivation exhibits a 
breakdown voltage of 24 V, which is a 3 V 
improvement compared to the Au gate pHEMT 
without passivation. From Table I, experimental 
data show that this passivation method is 
effective in terms of enhancing the 
characteristics of Schottky diodes. Furthermore, 
Pt/Au based Schottky contacts on the 
AlGaAs/InGaAs pHEMT devices are studied 
and shown to have better electrical 
characteristics than Au Schottky contacts. 
The barrier heights of the diodes are 
measured using standard current-voltage 
techniques. The I-V characteristics is [13]

of 18.3 GHz and fmax of 72.23 GHz, the 
passivated pHEMT with Pt/Au gate has achieved 
the highest fmax/fT yet reported for GaAs-based 
pHEMT with this gate length. At 2.4 GHz, the 
improved device has a minimum noise figure of 
0.7 dB and an associated gain of 16.45 dB at 300 
K. Our experimental results compare very 
favorably with previously reported values from 
pHEMTs with the similar gate length. The 
measured S-parameter results show an 
improvement in the microwave performance of 
HEMTs as the chuck temperature is lowered 
from 300 K to 250 K. Superlative performance is 
demonstrated in AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs pHEMT 
with the improved processing technology.
