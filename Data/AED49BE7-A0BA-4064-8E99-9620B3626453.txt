This work is proposed to study in three year. 
In the first year, a series copolyesters of 
succinic acid, ethylene glycol and 1,3- 
propanediol will be examined with the 
composition of diols ranging from 0% to 
100%. In the second year, the investigation 
will be focused on a series copolyesters 
synthesized from succinic acid, 1,4- 
butanediol and 1,3-propanediol. In the third 
year, only three compositions of the 
copolyesters derived from succinic acid, 
ethylene glycol and 1,4-butanediol will be 
prepared with the lowest melting points. The 
values of the enthalpy of fusion of ideal 
crystals will be determined from the melting 
point depression in the polymer-diluent 
system. The fold surface energy will be 
estimated from the kinetic analysis of 
growth rate data obtained from polarized 
light microscopy experiments, and the 
equilibrium melting point, as well as the 
enthalpy of fusion of ideal crystals. The 
crystal structure of copolymers near the 
minimum melting temperature will be 
investigated by wide angle X-ray diffraction 
(WAXD). Time-resolved synchrotron 
simultaneous WAXD and small-angle X-ray 
scattering experiments will be used to 
monitor crystallization behavior, melting 
behavior and the microstructure develop- 
ment of these random copolyesters. Two 
comonomer exclusion models and two 
comonomer inclusion models will be used to 
predict the melting point depression, and 
compare with the experimental data. The 
goal is to prove the compatibility of crystal 
structures.  
Keywords:  Aliphatic copolyesters, micro-

二、緣由與目的 
Only one year grant was approved. 
Therefore, the proposal of the first year was 
conducted, and the results were presented in 
five manuscripts which have been submitted 
to journals. The other two manuscripts are in 
preparation.

Spherulite Growth Rates of Poly(ethylene 
succinate) Using a Single Non-isothermal 
Experiment, Polymer, submitted. 
The spherulitic growth of poly(ethylene 
succinate) from 89 to 20 °C at a cooling rate 
of 8, 10, or 15 °C/min was monitored and 
recorded using an optical microscope 
equipped with a CCD camera and a DVD 
recorder. This experiment including the 
self-nucleation pretreatment took 40 min. 
Continuous growth rates between melting 
and glass transition temperatures can be 
obtained after two curve-fitting procedures. 
These data fit very well with those data 
points measured in the isothermal experi- 
ments, which is time consuming. These 
continuous growth rates were analyzed with 
the Hoffman and Lauritzen theory. A regime 
II-III transition was detected at 70.7 °C, 
which is very close to the literature values.

succinate) Copolyester Containing 5 mol-% 
Trimethylene Succinate. Crystallization Ki- 
netics and Morphology, Polymer, submitted. 
Poly(ethylene succinate-co-5 mole% trime- 
thylene succinate) was synthesized through 
a direct polycondensation reaction. It was 
characterized to be a random copolymer by 
 4
found to be random. Their thermal 
properties were characterized using 
differential scanning calorimeter and 
thermal gravimetric analyzer. All of the 
copolymers exhibit a single glass transition 
temperature (Tg) rather than two Tg‘s. There 
is no significant difference in the thermal 
stability among these polyesters. Wide angle 
X-ray diffractograms (WAXD) were 
obtained for polyesters which can be 
crystallized isothermally. The results of 
thermal analysis and the WAXD patterns 
indicate that the incorporation of TS units 
into PES significantly inhibits the crystal- 
lization behavior of PES. In addition, the 
crystal pattern of PTS is quite different from 
that of PES.

Behavior of Poly(ethylene succinate-co-21 
mol% trimethylene succinate) Copolyester, 
Eur Polym J, submitted.  
A copolyester was synthesized and charac- 
terized to have 78.6 mol-% ethylene suc- 
cinate unit and 21.4 mol-% trimethylene 
succinate unit by using NMR. The value of 
the random parameter, 0.97, is close 1 for a 
random copolymer. The melting behavior 
after isothermal crystallization was studied 
using differential scanning calorimeter by 
varying the crystallization temperature and 
the time of crystallization. Triple melting 
peaks were observed. The melting behavior 
indicates that the upper melting peaks are 
primarily due to the melting of lamellar 
crystals with different stability. The 
Hoffman-Weeks linear plot gives an equi- 
librium melting temperature of 93.9 °C. The 
spherulite growth of this copolyester from 
72 °C to 30 or 15 °C at a cooling rate of 1 or 
2 °C/min was monitored and recorded using 
an optical microscope equipped with a CCD 
camera and a DVD recorder. These 
experiments including the self-nucleation 
pretreatment took 72 min and 60 min, res- 
pectively. Continuous growth rates between 
melting and glass transition temperatures 
can be obtained after curve-fitting proce- 
dures. These data fit well with those data 
points measured in the isothermal expe- 
riments, which is time consuming. These 
isothermal and continuous data were 
separately analyzed with the Hoffman and 
Lauritzen theory. A regime II-III transition 
was detected at about 51.5±0.1 °C.
