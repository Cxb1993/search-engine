1. Introduction 
 
Since improvements in the processing speed of the AD/DA converter and DSP, 
programmable microwave technologies such as software-defined radio have been 
gaining increasing popularity. Although the converter speed is currently sufficient to 
deal with the microwave frequency band, the trend to achieve higher speeds will 
continue [1]. Use of a discrete-time technique to design microwave circuits will be an 
interesting issue in the future. Design of microwave passive components using the 
discrete-time method had been proposed [2]-[3]. Equal guided wavelength 
transmission lines in series-shunted-coupled formats are used to emulate unit delay 
elements. As a result, microwave filters having arbitrarily defined transfer functions in 
the z-domain have been implemented with microstrips.  
 
To extend the application of the discrete-time technique to generalized 
microwave circuits, it is pertinent to represent the scattering parameters of active 
microwave components in the z-domain. Scattering parameters are usually expressed 
in the frequency domain. A least squares approximation was employed to convert the 
scattering parameters of GaAs metal-semiconductor field effect transistors 
(MESFETs) into rational functions of angular frequency with 27 coefficients [4]. In 
this study, a weighted least squares method is employed to convert the 
frequency-domain scattering parameters into rational functions of infinite impulse 
response (IIR) process with an order of less than eight in the z-domain. 
 
Amplifier design has many different facets. In this study, we focus on the 
characteristics of gain flatness and broadband response of the amplifier at the output 
port. A GaAs FET FSX017LG [5] is employed to study the conversion of scattering 
parameters from frequency-domain to discrete-time-domain representations. 
Numerical results reveal that the scattering parameters of a radio-frequency transistor 
are well represented by a low-order IIR process in the z-domain. The input-output 
transmission-line configuration is obtained for an amplifier that satisfies the 
characteristics of a band-pass filter by using the least squares error optimization 
method. In particular, parallel forms of z-domain polynomials are presented to reduce 
the noise in the optimization process. Measured results are presented to verify the 
effectiveness of the novel design method.

2.2 Stability Consideration 
 A broadband transistor generally fails to satisfy the unconditional stability 
requirement over the frequency band of interest. The stability factor μ [7] is less 
than 1 from DC to 6 GHz. To improve the stability, a series R-C negative feedback 
circuit connecting the gate and the drain is added to the transistor [8] with R = 350 Ω 
and C = 33 pF. Fig. 2 shows that this active component with a feedback circuit 
satisfies the unconditional stability condition for frequencies ranging from 0.5 GHz to 
15 GHz.

We convert the frequency-domain scattering parameters of FSX017LG with the 
R-C feedback circuit into the z-domain representations. The obtained coefficients of 
discrete-time scattering parameter S11 are as follows:  
=11b [-0.2066, -0.2274, 0.1694, 0.6392, 2.6048, 2.4266, 0.7030, 0.3583], 
=11a [1.0000, 2.0844, 5.2831, 5.0297, 1.4926, 0.9067, -0.0234, -0.13750]. The 
coefficients of S12 are given as =12b [0.0865, 0.0909, 0.2312, 0.3700, 0.1426, 0.0819, 
0.0550, -0.0092], =12a [1.0000, 0.7565, 2.1445, 2.9160, 0.0849, -0.0353, 0.1382, 
-0.0663].  
 
The coefficients of S21 are expressed as =21b [0.1094, -0.6858, -4.6244, -6.5157, 
-3.7606, -2.7228, -2.1664, -0.5829], =21a [1.0000, 2.4040, 1.7242, 1.0089, 0.9269, 
0.3135, 0.0170, -0.0064]. The corresponding coefficients of S22 are given as 
=22b [-0.5595, -0.6549, 0.8147, 4.7817, 6.9509, 1.3299, -2.4432, -0.7535], 
=22a [1.0000, 3.5009, 13.1768, 20.0389, 8.7844, -1.9793, -2.4918, -0.9717]. 
 
Fig. 3 shows S11 and S22 complex curves of both the z-domain model and the 
original data on Smith charts. Fig. 4 shows S12 and S21 complex curves. The complex 
responses of the z-domain model are in good agreement with their original data, 
except for the normalized frequencies ω = 0 and ω= π. When ω  is π or 0, Sij(z) in 
(6) is real, which deviates from the original Sij(ω). However, such a limitation has 
little effect on practical implementation.

We select four short stubs, two open stubs, four two-section open-circuited stubs, 
as well as series unit lines as the basic matching networks. The configuration of the 
amplifier design is shown in Fig. 6. Notice that the circuit configuration in Fig.6 is 
selected to meet the required circuit response S21ideal shown in Fig.5. To simplified the 
optimization algorithm requirements for both S11 and S21 are neglected for the present 
consideration. A close look of Fig.6 indicates that there are six nulls in the frequency 
range of interest. Four equal-length two-section open stubs are employed to 
implement four zeros located at 0.125π,0.19π,0.71π and 0.79π. Four one-section stubs 
are used to the null at 0π, while two one-section open stubs are used to realized the 
null at π. Both of Rf and Cf are used to improve the stability of the microwave 
transistor so that the transistor maintains the unconditionally stable condition over the 
entire frequency range. As stated in section 2.2. We have Rf=350Ω and Cf=33pF.

The direct form in (19) could be obtained by making reduction of fractions to a 
  11
Now consider how the roots of the denominator and numerator polynomials are 
affected by the errors in the coefficients. Clearly, each polynomial root is affected by 
all of the errors in the coefficients of the polynomial. Thus, each pole and zero will be 
affected by all of the quantization errors in the denominator and numerator 
polynomials, respectively. More specifically, Kaiser(1966) showed that if the Poles 
and zeros of high-order z-polynomials are located tightly, small errors in the 
coefficients of the denominator or nominator can cause large changes in poles and 
zeros in this direct-form expression. Therefore, poles and zeros of the direct-form 
structure are quite sensitive to the variation of the coefficients of high-order 
z-polynomials. Fig. 8 shows that the parallel-form function in (18) is generally much 
less sensitive to coefficient variation than the equivalent direct-form function. To 
reduce the numerical noise during the system simulation, the parallel-form 
polynomials of chain-scattering parameters were adopted in this study.

5. Conclusion 
 
 A discrete-time domain method was proposed to design an ultra-wideband 
amplifier embedded with a band-pass filter. The proposed amplifier achieves a flat 
gain response. Four pairs of complex conjugate roots of the fifth-order ultra-wideband 
Chebyshev band-pass filter in the z-domain are implemented with four two-section 
open stubs that give transmission zeros in the lower and upper stopbands. Therefore, 
it has good fall-off selectivity. In addition, the unattainable characteristic impedances 
of transmission-line sections at the output matching network are modified by the 
frequency-bandwidth-impedance method. The novel method provides a basis for the 
integration of microwave applications and discrete-time signal processes.
