 本計畫藉由已建立之兩相紊流實驗和理論分析的堅實基礎，詳請見參考文獻[1]，於
前年(第一年度計畫)我們以高速數位質點影像測速儀(particle image velocimetry，PIV)佐

研究生，導引他們進入複雜的兩相紊流領域，本研究以紊流場特徵隨壓力的變化情形之
探討作為開端，對壓力效應作一詳細探討。經由PIV速度量測與小波轉換分析結果發現，
提高壓力確實可以降低流體之運動黏滯係數，進而達成提升紊流雷諾數之效果。由於高
壓與低壓紊流場之軌跡粒子影像拍攝不易，其後續的分析與探討亦相當費時，是故本研

ㄧ、前言 
 兩相紊流研究領域中尚未解決的關鍵問題之一，即為重粒子於紊流中下沉與散佈問
題。瞭解粒子於紊流中下沉及散佈機制，對許多工業界和自然界流場將有重要的助益，
舉凡如燃燒器內之噴霧混合、流體化床(fluidized bed)、氣體輸送(pneumatic transport)、
靜電除塵器(electrostatic precipatator)與濕式洗滌塔(wet gas scrubber)之重粒子收集、河川
沙粒之沉澱沖積、火山灰雲之沉降和大氣氣溶膠(aerosol)微粒之散佈，均為相關課題，
是一攸關著環境保護和汙染防治的研究領域。若考慮重粒子為點狀力與紊流交互作用，
則於其下沉時，那些點狀力將施力於流體並和由流體反作用於其上之阻力相互競爭，此
兩相紊流問題，將引導出與不含重粒子之紊流相當不同的流體動力行為(Wang & Maxey 
[2])。現階段關於兩相紊流研究實驗，大部分是在自由剪力流(free shear flows)或在衰減
性均勻紊流(decaying homogeneous turbulence)等由風洞和水洞所產生的流場中進行。反
觀，重粒子於紊流中下沉之實驗則相當的稀少，因為粒子尚未達終端下沉速度即被風洞
中平均流速所吹走等因素，使得進行實驗遇到許多困難。目前此方面研究，數值模擬的
結果居多，例如有 Wang & Maxey [2], Mei [3], Yang & Lei [4]等人，對重粒子於靜態均
勻等向性紊流(stationary homogeneous isotropic turbulence)作數值模擬分析。可是，那些
數值模擬分析結果彼此並不相符，有些重要問題仍未被瞭解，如(1)是否紊流效應會增加
亦或減少粒子之平均下沉速度？(2)粒子分佈濃度和下沉機制如何地受紊流特徵時間和
速度尺度變化之影響？(3)重粒子之存在是否會修正紊流的特性？故此方面之研究，亟需
有實驗的結果來驗證數值模擬的可靠度，也是本研究主要動機之所在。 
二、文獻回顧 
 流體動力於粒子裝載(particle-laden)紊流中，與兩個重要無因次參數有關，一為
Stokes數(St = τp/τK，粒子響應時間比上紊流Kolmogorov時間尺度)，另一為終端速度比
(terminal velocity ratio = Vt/vK or Vt/u′，粒子終端速度(Vt)比上紊流特徵速度，vK為
Kolmogorov速度尺度，u′為紊流均方根擾動速度)。Wang & Maxey [2]用直接數值模擬
(direct numerical simulation，DNS)，發現重粒子於紊流場中之平均下沉速度(mean settling 
velocity，Vs)相較於靜態流場之終端速度有明顯的增加，他們認為Kolmogorov尺度之渦
漩在粒子下沉問題中扮演重要角色，而粒子偏好聚集(preferential concentration)於高應變
率和低渦度之區域之現象則於St = 1 時最為明顯。而Yang & Lei [4]用DNS和大渦模擬
(large eddy simulation，LES)分析紊流之特徵尺度效應，得到不同的結果。主要相異點有
二：(1)偏好聚集現象集中於低渦度區，其特徵渦度結構之尺度比Kolmogorov長度尺度(η)
大上一個order；(2)對偏好聚集有影響之速度尺度為u′非vK，顯示大尺度渦漩也在粒子下
沉問題中扮演一個重要的角色。Mei [3]用蒙地卡羅模擬(Monte Carlo simulation)，則找到
1 
用PIV來量測重粒子於紊流中之下沉速度，我們找到即使Rep = u′dp/ν = 25，Vs也會大於
Vt之結論，其中dp為粒子平均直徑，ν為流體運動黏滯係數(kinematic viscosity)，詳請見
Yang & Shy [10]。但因為液態等向性紊流產生裝置的限制，我們無法對Rep < 1 之流場作
研究。為了克服上述限制，本實驗室特別設計了一新型氣態均勻等向性紊流產生器(Fig. 
1)，它包含了一長垂直圓管和一大尺寸之水平圓管，呈十字型狀，長垂直圓管可提供具
均勻粒徑的重粒子有充分的響應時間達到終端速度，而水平圓管兩端各配備 10 匹馬力
馬達和特製風扇，同時反向旋轉，氣流穿越空孔板，可於兩空孔板核心區產生一近似等
向性紊流場[11]。應用高速數位PIV量測技術，我們已獲得在常壓條件下(1 atm)重粒子於
紊流中之平均下沉速度及其相關統計資料，此研究成果並已發表於國際頂尖流力期刊
Journal of Fluid Mechanics (Yang & Shy [1])。 
 雖然，本實驗室最近在重粒子於紊流下沉問題中，已有部分重要成果(Yang & Shy 
[1])，如(1)確認紊流可增加重粒子之平均下沉速度(在Rep < 1 的條件下)，(2)且已獲取定
量之數據，對DNS或LES等數值模擬計算之進一步發展有重要助益，(3)紊流特徵尺度對
偏好聚集現象之影響也有重要發現。但是，這些結果均是在Ret = u′LI/ν < 600 的條件下
所獲得，這是因為高速數位PIV量測設備，僅能在適度大小之u′值範圍作量測。我們知
道實際流場之紊流雷諾數是遠高於 600，故本計畫特別提出一具原創性之實驗，擬以高
壓狀態來降低流體運動黏滯係數，在u′和LI值沒有太大改變的條件下，期能使Ret值提高
二至三倍。 
三、實驗方法 
3.1 十字型紊流產生器 
 Figure 1 為十字型紊流產生器與高速數位 PIV 等相關影像擷取設備的示意圖，而近
似等向性紊流場，就是藉由水平圓柱鋼管內一對相同但反向旋轉的風扇，搭配中心氣室
兩旁之空孔板所產生。在垂直圓柱鋼管上方有一特別設計之粒子散佈產生器，其內有一
水平震動裝置，含一偏心的直流馬達，用以驅動震動裝置，使重粒子能持續被篩選通過
震動裝置下方兩張交疊之細篩網，經篩選後具均勻粒徑之重粒子下沉進入測試區內，當
粒子濃度達到適當值時，便可執行 PIV 量測。流場觀測所使用的軌跡粒子(tracer particle)
則為平均粒徑 0.3 μm 的氧化鋁粒子。我們已建構高低壓實驗所需之氣密裝置，並已改
良出可適用於高低壓環境之粒子注入系統，將來可以順利執行後續兩相紊流實驗。此一
創新實驗設計，可避免因粒子注入所導致之流場平均速度改變和紊流衰減等不當影響，
排除量測重粒子和紊流間雙向交互作用無法精確的缺點。 
 本實驗為獲得最佳畫質的數位PIV影像，風扇轉頻(f)必須控制在小於 12 Hz以下，否
3 
續的時序影像執行快速傅立葉轉換獲得個別影像之傅立葉係數，接著將ㄧ傅立葉係數與
另一傅立葉係數所對應之共軛複數兩者作乘積，反轉換後即可求得交叉相關的數據平
面。然後利用三點運算子(three-point estimators)從次像素層(subpixel layer)內來推估位
移。一般來說，三點運算子大多採拋物線峰值或高斯峰值，本研究則以cubic spline峰值
來趨近，可以得到較平滑的曲線並提升次像素的準確性。我們使用以Matlab為平台的FFT
軟體來做數位PIV交叉相關處理[14]，可取任意大小(邊長非 2n pixels)的計算窗格
(interrogation window)做了多組的測試，發現滿足硬體設備最理想的計算窗格大小為 40 × 
40 個像素，而計算窗格所搭配之重疊比例為 87.5% [1]。 
    數位 PIV 的精確度主要由四種粒子影像之效應來鑑定[15]，分別是粒子影像的(1)影
像粒徑、(2)影像位移、(3)粒子密度以及(4)超出光頁面的第三維度運動。 
    如 Fig. 2c 所示，流場視景的物理尺寸為 6 cm × 5 cm，其上有九個等間隔以棋盤狀
分佈的英文字母(a, b, c,…, i)，代表時序 PIV 速度量測分析的位置。在約 2.1 s 內的連續
記錄中，九個字母位置點的任一點至少都包含著 2046 筆具有 x 方向與 y 方向兩個分量
的時序速度訊號。這九個點同樣也是我們用來對時序速度資訊執行時序小波轉換分析的
位置點。 
3.3 小波轉換 
 我們使用連續的一維複數值 Morlet 小波函數來轉換這些來自數位 PIV 量測的速度
訊號，以便獲得整個慣性和消散區域中重要的時間與空間特徵尺度。連續實數訊號值經
小波轉換(wavelet transform，WT)後所得到的小波係數 ( )baW , ，諸如鉛直方向或水平方
向的速度訊號 或( )tv ( )tu ，可以定義為速度訊號與一個解析小波函數的內積[16]： 
( ) ( ) ( )∫∞∞−= dtttvbaW ba*,, φ ， (1) 
其中 ( ) ( ) ( )( )abtatba −= φφ 1, a， 與 分別是時間膨脹與位移參數，而 則表示其共軛複
數。所對應的複數值 Morlet 小波函數為 
b *φ
( ) ( )( )220 tti eet −= ωφ ， (2) 
在本實驗中我們定義 πω 20 = [16]，可解析的小波函數 ( )tb,aφ 是小波母函數 ( )tφ 經過膨脹與
位移後的變化形式， ( )tφ 的解析度和位置分別為 和 。因此，在時間訊號 t = b 的特定
位置上與周期 a 的特定小波尺度上的小波轉換便可以定義出來。因為 Morlet 小波函數可
以指出每一特定尺度下的局部能量密度，紊流的特徵尺度便可以被解析獲得。關於空間
的小波分析，只要將方程式(1)和(2)中的時間參數 t 換成距離參數 r，則空間的小波係數
1−a b
5 
作平均，我們發現等向性紊流場之空間平均速度場(Fig. 2)會隨著壓力的提高而逐漸增
強，顯示壓力的提升確實可以增強紊流雷諾數。同樣的情形也可以在時序速度變化圖(Fig. 
3 & 4)中觀察到，小尺度速度擾動不論在哪一維度皆隨壓力增加而變得更加顯著。Figure 
5 ~ 7 分別為 1.5 atm、1 atm 與 0.5 atm 之空間尺度分析圖，先選取空間平均速度場上具
明顯渦度結構之線段，將沿著該線段的速度資訊經小波轉換後得之，我們可以看出隨著
壓力逐漸提升特徵尺度結構愈趨明顯，即具有較高之小波係數值。在小波轉換時間尺度
分析圖(Fig. 8 & 9)上我們亦觀察到類似情形，不僅如此，時間尺度的多重性也會因為提
高壓力而增加。任一維度之能量頻譜在慣性區(inertial range)內的遞減斜率皆呈−5/3 (Fig. 
10 & 11)，顯示本流場具有全展紊流(fully-developed turbulence)的基本特徵。能量頻譜於
較高頻小波(n′′ = 30 ~ 200 Hz)之區域，疑因高速攝影機解析度不足與高頻雜訊的影響，
略呈現上揚趨勢，但稍後由於黏滯消散而迅速遞減。對任一壓力條件，平坦度因子
(flatness factor，FF)皆會隨著特徵小波頻率升高而增強(Fig. 12 & 13)，證實等向性紊流
具有活躍的小尺度間歇性活動。由機率密度函數圖(Fig. 14)我們可以發現，1.5 atm 之實
驗條件下紊流擾動速度雖然較強，但比較由低而高三種不同壓力條件卻沒有明顯隨壓力
遞增的傾向。事實上，運動黏滯係數隨壓力變化的改變是相當緩和的，壓力效應可能仍
不足以與風扇轉頻效應抗衡，故小尺度活動雖然增強了但大尺度活動卻沒有改變，可直
接由時序速度變化圖(Fig. 3 & 4)觀察得知。最後，我們針對每一個壓力條件之能量頻譜，
取慣性區域內之能量值與其所對應之頻率值做乘積，平均後得到紊流場之整體能量隨壓
力的變化(Fig. 15)，證實提升壓力確實可以提高紊流場之強度。 
 有關高速數位粒子影像速度和加速度量測技術，以及小波轉換分析技術，已初步完
成研究生之基本訓練，但研究生仍須不斷努力練習才能熟悉實驗之操作，此部分仍有甚
大改善空間。我們將繼續以PIV量測技術與小波轉換分析技術，針對高低壓力時重粒子
於紊流場內下沉，兩相交互作用下之空間和時間的重要特徵，期能對重粒子下沉速度、
偏好聚集和紊流修正等重要機制，獲得定性與定量的實驗結果。我們預計於高低壓流場
條件下著手進行一系列高速數位PIV量測；針對 0.5 ~ 1.5 atm，風扇轉頻f = 2、4、5、7、
8 與 10 Hz，以平均粒徑Dp = 40 μm ~ 60 μm之玻璃重粒子，同時進行兩相紊流交互作用
之流場與重粒子速度場量測。完成實驗後，將進行速度場資料分析，求出粒子平均下沉
速度及應用本實驗室所發展之質點影像粒子加速度量測技術，量測重粒子加速度場，再
配合理論公式，推導具粒子負載(particle-laden)之紊流的流體速度場，並與實驗量測結果
互相驗證。且將應用本實驗室所建立之多種小波轉換分析法，解析前述兩相紊流中之特
徵時間和空間的尺度。 
 我們已發現前述之高低壓等向性紊流場的慣性區域內，其小波能量頻譜，至少可從
3 Hz ~ 50 Hz之間，呈現−5/3 的遞減斜率，顯示此一紊流場具有全展紊流之特徵。我們
也可以識別此一紊流場之特徵尺度，即時間與長度的積分尺度(integral scale)、泰勒微尺
度(Taylor microscale)，在不使用泰勒假設(Taylor hypothesis)的情況下，直接對速度場作
小波轉換分析來獲得，是故其結果可用於評估傳統泰勒假設之可靠度。我們也分析了平

ABSTRACT 
We measure and analyze important spatiotemporal 
characteristics of featureless air turbulence in the 
well-known Taylor-Couette (TC) flow using high-speed, 
high-resolution digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) 
and wavelet analyses. Featureless turbulence is generated 
in the annulus gap between two concentric 
counter-rotating inner and outer long cylinders with 
specific rotating speed ratio. DPIV measurements of 
featureless turbulence are conducted, including radial, 
axial and azimuthal velocity data. By decomposing these 
velocity data using wavelet transform, the characteristic 
length and time scales, energy spectra and the degree of 
intermittency can be thus obtained. It is found that all 
three dimensional velocity components reveal a 
near-Gaussian distribution with negligible mean 
velocities when compared to their turbulence intensities, 
indicating that featureless turbulence has very high 
degree of homogeneity. All energy spectra in three 
dimensions show a −5/3 decaying slope in the inertial 
subrange, showing that featureless turbulence is a 3-D 
fully-developed homogeneous turbulence. The wavelet 
scales at the highest intermittency level are found to be 
on the same order of the estimated Kolmogorov scale, 
which indicates that the strongest intermittent motion 
occurs at the dissipated scale. Furthermore, experiments 
on settling phenomena of heavy glass particles 
descending in featureless turbulence are carried out, 
where heavy particles of St ≈ 6 or 13 are used. St = τp/τK; 
τp and τK are respectively the particle relaxation time and 
the Kolmogorov time scale. The Reynolds numbers for 
these heavy particles, Rep = VtDp/ν, are all less than unity, 
so that only linear Stokes drag is considered, where Vt, Dp 
and ν are the terminal velocity and the diameter of heavy 
particles, and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid, 
respectively. It can be seen that these descending heavy 
particles response well to vortex structures in featureless 
turbulence, revealing a preferential sweeping along the 
periphery of strong vortex structures in the gravitational 
direction. Apparent variations on particle movements due 
to strong vortex pairings are observed, including 
acceleration, deceleration, and turning into horizontal 
movements. Finally, it is found that featureless 
turbulence can enhance the average particle settling 
velocity to be well above its terminal velocity, up to 
200% for the maximum increase.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Andereck et al. [1] stated that featureless 
turbulence lacks any apparent large-scale structure, that 
the visible dominant length scale is smaller than the gap 
between two cylinders and that its power spectrum has a 
high frequency drop-off consistent with the power law. 
Besides above description, no firm conclusion was drawn. 
Ronney et al. [2] directly applied featureless turbulence, 
on condition of Reo/Rei = −1.35 = const. and Reo > 1000, 
to liquid flame propagation in unsteady aqueous mixtures 
of arsenious acid and iodate, where Reo ≡ roωod/ν and Rei 
≡ riωid/ν, ω is the angular velocity, r is the radius, the 
subscripts o and i are respectively the outer and inner 
cylinders, ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid, and d ≡ ro 
− ri. Through laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) 
measurements they indicated, without detailed analyses 
and relevant diagrams, that featureless turbulence is 
nearly homogeneous across the annulus though not 
entirely isotropic, that its velocity histograms are 
approximately Gaussian, and that the velocity 
auto-correlation function is nearly exponential. Moreover, 
they calculated the integral time scale (τI) by the integral 
of this auto-correlation function, and d/LI ≈ 2.5 ~ 4.2 
from which LI ≡ π/8 u’rmsτI (Abdel-Gayed et al. [3]), 
where LI is the integral length scale of featureless 
turbulence, and u’rms is root-mean-squared turbulence 
intensity. 
 Vaezi et al. [4] continued the work by creating a 
Taylor-Couette apparatus of high-intensity (up to 120 
cm/s, about 2.5 times the value of Ronney et al. [2]) 
homogenous gaseous featureless turbulence and using the 
lean methane/air mixture instead of aqueous solution. 
Upon condition that Reo/Rei = −1.4, Reo ≈ 1000 ~ 12,250 
and LDV measurements, they indicated that the mean 
and fluctuating properties of turbulence are stationary 
and uniform over many integral length scales upstream of 
the flame zone and nearly homogeneous over 50% of the 
flame-brush area. Furthermore, it was found that the

overlap was set as a constant of 75%. This code has been 
modified to have the smoothing capacity needed in this 
study. The smoothing function in the Matlab tool box is 
directly applied, and 5-points interpolation of the lowess 
method is used, together with special designed smoothing 
paths for the 2D flow. The comparison of the results 
between the commercial PIV system (IDT X-Stream 
Vision) and our modified version showed very good 
correspondence. The way we conducted smoothing of 2D 
data was that smoothing the data matrix along two 
directions, namely, on the vertical and horizon. When 
smoothing in vertical, we should transform the data 
matrix to an ordered data line, of which the collected 
order can be from top to bottom first and then from left to 
right. For the horizontal smoothing the same method was 
used. Smoothing data, however, may lose or average 
some intermittent characteristics in the flow of interest, 
but this effect should not alter the large scale motion. The 
spatial velocity field and the following vorticity field 
used here are mainly presented to have a better display of 
the combination of macro and micro scale motions of the 
flow. The small scale motion is not easily to capture in 
this study, due to the limitation of the coupled effect of 
the spatial resolution of the experimental system, the 
strong three-dimensional velocity fluctuations, the 
complexity of boundary effects and intermittency of the 
small scales. 
 A continuous one-dimensional “Morlet” complex 
wavelet is used to transform the DPIV velocity data. 
Wavelet decomposition is better than conventional 
Fourier decomposition for it can show what and where 
the specific scale is. And the “Morlet” mother wavelet is 
validated to be able to show good representations of the 
turbulent characteristics (Yang et al. [6]). In this study, 
we apply the same method of wavelet transform to obtain 
the energy spectrum and the level of intermittency, as 
Yang et al. [6] did in the measurement of isotropic 
turbulence. 
 In the theory of turbulence, the energy spectrum 
with a decaying slope of -5/3 is treated as a necessary 
feature in presence of the turbulent flow, and is a very 
important consequence resulted from the turbulence scale 
analysis (Durbin & Petterson Reif [7]). The fourth order 
velocity structure function can be treated as a 
measurement of the how large the tail of a PDF is in the 
statistical description (Tennekes & Lumley [8]). And this 
value is often called the flatness factor or kurtosis, which 
show the extent of intermittency of the small scale 
motion in the turbulent flow. Hinze [9] indicated that if 
the isotropy of turbulence really holds, the kurtosis 
should be equal to 3, that is to say, the value of kurtosis 
larger than 3 means some degree of intermittency. The 
smallest scale of the turbulence, the Kolmogorov scale, 
may be identified under the examination of the variation 
of kurtosis. Furthermore, the spectrum measurement can 
provide information about small scale as well. In a 
loosely sense, the energy spectrum curve is often 
interpreted in terms of the energy associated with eddies 
with various sizes (Tritton [10]). 
 The approach, we used to capture the coordinate 
point in the transition diagram (Andereck et al. [1]) 
where featureless turbulence occurs, was to execute the 
experiments by gradually increasing Rei from 0 to 2100 
while Reo being keep at 2650. We can obtain the flow 
field based on observation of three fundamental 
characteristics of turbulence, namely, random, 
unpredictable and reproducible. Note that this transition 
diagram was on a basis of the liquid flow, so that the 
direct use is not proper. 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 Featureless Turbulence 
 Here we present the case of 8000 data (1.6 s) of 
featureless turbulence of Rei = 2100 and Reo = 2650. Fig. 
2 and 3 show the instantaneous flow maps of the velocity 
field superimposed on the corresponding vorticity field 
for the shooting plane A and B, respectively. The equally 
spaced Arabic numbers on the map are the acquisition 
points of the temporal velocity signals. The probability 
density functions (PDFs) of three components of 
temporal velocity signals obtained at the selected points 
(point 5 of plane A and 2 of plane B) are pictured in fig. 
4. Note that all these Gaussian curves are calculated from 
the smoothed velocity data, and drawn for convenient 
comparison with the distribution of datum points, not a 
fitting curve. Fig. 4 shows the typical characters of the 
PDFs of the temporal velocity data of featureless 
turbulence, namely, (1) distribution is near-Gaussian-like, 
(2) standard deviation is larger in the horizontal 
component and (3) mean velocities are much smaller than 
the velocity fluctuation and may be neglected. The above 
description implies that featureless turbulence is a truly 
random but nonisotropic turbulence with the negligible 
mean flow. And all the PDFs are reproducible, and it 
means that we can always get the same PDFs statistically. 
Note that this 3D PDF of featureless turbulence from 
different shooting planes were not executed 
simultaneously. The acquisition point we chose is one of 
the most three appropriate positions (4 & 1, 5 & 2 and 6 
& 3 in plane A & B, respectively) standing for the 3D 
flow in our study. The typical characters of the velocity 
PDFs of featureless turbulence retain, but the PDFs of 
axial components of two different planes show an 
apparent difference in standard deviation. This may be 
due to two reasons, (1) the strong boundary effect that 
will be mentioned later, and (2) the unsteady effect since 
these data of two planes were not obtained at the same 
time. Here we will highlight on the boundary effect 
because it should never be neglected. The dual effect of 
the above two effects is not considered due to its 
complexity. 
 We also found that the mean values of vertical 
components are more convergent than those of horizontal 
ones. Note that in the single-phase study the outer 
cylinder was rotating clockwise. It was found that the 
outer cylinder motion is more responsible for the 
horizontal mean fluid motion but having nothing to do 
with velocity fluctuations of both components.

The 30thNational Conference on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, December 15-16, 2006, DYU, Changhwa, Taiwan, R.O.C. 
deserves to be paid on this topic in the future. 
 By simply examining the results of energy spectra 
and kurtosis analyses, the smallest scale in turbulence can 
be estimated. However, the highest intermittency level 
did not show up at the corresponding frequency of the 
calculated Kolmogorov time scale in these cases, 
although of the same order of magnitude. 
3.5 Preferential Sweeping in Two-Phase Flow 
 In the study of the two-phase flow the outer 
cylinder was rotating counterclockwise. In the two-phase 
experiments, glass particles of 40 μm and 60 μm in 
diameter were released into the flow with its terminal 
velocity, and the corresponding St were about 6 and 13. 
Fig. 8 exhibits a superimposed trajectory of a 40 μm 
glass particle in featureless turbulence (Rei = 2100 and 
Reo = 2650), and this image had the time duration of 2 ms. 
It is a very interesting phenomenon that a heavy particle 
of St ≈ 6 would be in the horizontal motion. Actually, this 
glass particle initially had very small positive vertical 
velocity, that is, it was decelerated from its initial 
free-fall terminal velocity to move in the opposite way. 
Note that the trajectory was formed by superimposing the 
successive raw images. The corresponding vorticity 
fields are calculated at the midpoint of time duration of 
the trajectory. It was found in comparison between fig. 8 
and 9 that the particle was accelerated with a small angle 
of elevation by a stretched vortex pair (acceleration path). 
The strong and long acceleration path made the glass 
particle move in a very high speed, so to speak, about 1/5 
of the outer cylinder azimuthal speed (about 430 cm/s). 
This speed is rough equal to half of the maximum fluid 
azimuthal velocity (about 150 ~ 160 cm/s). It is inferred 
that the strong vertex pairing is the key mechanism for 
the change in motion of heavy particles. Also, in the fig. 
9 we can observe a clear wavy jet stream appearing in the 
same position formed by the vortex pairing. By contrast, 
the vortex pairing might be formed by the jet stream. 
This jet stream is evidence of the existing of the vortex 
pairing, and it tends to appear in the horizontal sense. The 
comparison between the trajectories and its 
corresponding fields of the shear rate (not shown here) 
shows that the particle track did not necessarily go 
through the regions of high strain rates. That is to say that 
the dominant mechanism of particle preferential 
sweeping is mainly influenced by the vortex structures. 
 Fig. 10 showed many trajectories of 60 μm glass 
particle during the time period of 16 ms. Note that not all 
the particle trajectories in the image appeared during the 
whole period of 16 ms and that all the horizontal 
pathlines of the discrete large dots are the very fast 
moving glass particle trajectories. Five specified particle 
pathlines were selected for observation, and the vertical 
displacement with the particle terminal velocity was 
drawn for comparison. Fig. 10 clearly shows that 
pathlines 1 (4 ~ 12 ms), 2 (0 ~ 12 ms) and 4 (0 ~ 16 ms), 
showed up in straight tracks, seemed to settle with the 
unaltered free-fall rates, while pathlines 3 (0 ~ 16 ms) 
and 5 (0 ~ 16 ms) were settling with a much faster rate. 
Because of the long period of superposition of images, 
the background fluid tracks should not be interpreted. In 
the beginning of the flow (0 ms), a jet stream was 
observed in the lower left part of the velocity map. That 
may be the reason why the heavy particles in this region 
had a horizontal movement towards the right [11 & 12]. 
In the subsequent maps we found that the jet stream in 
the lower left weakened apparently. However, another 
violent jet stream was being formed gradually while the 
strong counterclockwise vortex (positive in vorticity) 
kept moving downward to pair the negative vortex. This 
new born vortex pair, kept strengthening, maintained the 
energy of the jet stream, so that the motions of pathlines 
1, 2 and 4 sustained. For pathline 4, we found that no 
dominant vortex structure led to the enhancement of 
settling velocity, although that there was a moderate 
vortex pair showing up during 2 to 6 ms. Therefore, the 
faster settling rate seemed to be mainly cause by some 
mechanism in the radial-axial plane. As for the pathline 5, 
it was clear that the increasing settling rate was due to the 
fact that the particle kept falling along the down flow side 
of the strong vortex, and that the bending sweeping of the 
particle was caused by the migration of the strong 
positive vortex and the subsequent pairing with the 
negative one, as mentioned before. 
 Finally, it is inferred from above discussion that 
there might be some coexisting relevance between the 
vortex pairing and the jet stream. Recall that the strongest 
jet stream does occur frequently in the azimuthal 
direction, due to the primary stretch effect in this sense. 
So the phenomena of the jet stream should be revealed in 
the cross-section (cross lines of 1-2-3, 4-5-6 and 7-8-9) of 
the horizontal flow. We found that the azimuthal flow 
had some similar trends on every cross line indeed and 
that all these periods were 0.2 s, in agreement with the 
time scale analysis (fig. 5). This may help to confirm that 
the large scale vortex structures, of which their life times 
were of 0.2 s, did exist. 
3.6 Uncertainty Analyses 
 In this study we used an interrogation window size 
of 32 × 32 pixel2 to process all measuring data of DPIV 
calculations. Is this a good choice? Or is it reasonable? In 
the spatial DPIV analysis, it is well known that the 
window size plays an important role in velocity data 
calculations. The larger size window can perform a 
calculation with higher degree of smoothing, while the 
smaller one can probe into the detail of the velocity 
signal in the smaller scales at the same pixel resolution. 
However, turbulence is a multiscale flow, of which the 
largest scale may be several hundred times the size of the 
smallest scales. So we have to choose an appropriate 
interrogation window that can do the DPIV calculation 
reasonably well in both smaller scales and the larger 
scales. The overlap of the window size used in the DPIV 
calculation at a fixed spatial position will not affect the 
accuracy of the resulted velocity value. This is a basic 
idea in DPIV calculation, and we can change the overlap 
percentage to control the vector number in the spatial 
domain. In the present study, we set overlap ratio as a 
constant of 0.75 to obtain a vector field composed of 59 ×

Fig. 1. An energy-adjustable spark-electrode ignition system. The electrode with sharp ends ignites lean methane 
mixtures in the central position of a large fan-stirred cruciform burner equipped with perforated plates for generating 
intense isotropic turbulence. Typical voltage and current waveforms are shown on the right. 
consisting of a large horizontal vessel and a vertical vessel. 
Figure 1 presents a real image of the central part of the 
cruciform burner superimposed on a typical laminar flame 
propagation image showing the spherical propagating flame 
and the position of the spark electrodes. Also plotted are 
schematic diagrams of a high-power spark-discharging system 
(Velonex Model 360, V-2428 pulse transformer, etc) and a 
high-speed image acquisition system as well as typical 
recording traces of voltage and current generated by one shot 
of the spark-electrode as shown on the right of Fig. 1. In the 
horizontal cylindrical vessel of the cruciform burner, two 
identical but counter-rotating fans and perforated plates of 
36% solidity are installed at both ends. Each of the two fans is 
independently driven by a 10-HP DC motor and synchronized 
to the same speed, of which a maximum fan frequency of 172 
Hz can be achieved when the water cooling system is applied 
to both shafts. In the core region between two perforated 
plates, a uniform near-isotropic turbulence region, roughly 15 
× 15 × 15 cm3 in volume, can be generated having intense 
turbulent intensities up to 8 m/s. Energy spectra of fluctuating 
velocity components in all three directions exhibit −5/3 
decaying slopes covering a wide range of characteristic scales 
[1,6,22], indicating that this flow is a true 3D fully-developed 
turbulence. 
Here we apply two steel meshes which are placed at the upper 
and lower bounds of the central uniform region to stop 
subsequent flame propagation into the vertical vessel to avoid 
unwanted burning directly onto the spark-electrode. The high-
power spark-discharging system consists of a pulse generator 
and transformer, capable of discharging a high voltage up to 
20 kV with selectable pulse durations from 0.05 μs to 3 ms. 
Four modes of discharging are available, including one shot, 
internal pulse repetition frequency, external drive, and external 
trigger, respectively. For simplicity, one shot mode with a 
fixed pulse duration of 100 μs is used for all experiments in 
this study. A variety of resistances from 0 to 50 kΩ are used to 
vary spark ignition energies from 0 to about 71 mJ. 
Previous studies by Kono and his co-workers [e.g., 17] as well 
as Ziegler et al. [15] have demonstrated that the ignition 
energy of spark discharge depends upon gas density and 
species, electrode material, size and geometry, current, gap 
width, and type of discharge. For simplicity, the present work 
applies a stainless-steel spark-electrode with very sharp needle 
ends on anode and cathode separated by a fixed gap width of 
2.6 mm. This gap width gives the smallest MIE for a given 
methane/air mixture using the present stainless-steel spark-
electrode, as to be discussed. On the right of Fig. 1, it shows 
typical recording traces of voltage and current waveforms, 
measured by a Tektronix high-voltage probe and a Pearson 
current monitor. As can be seen, the discharging spark occurs 
soon after the onset of initial high voltage output to produce 
the concurrent voltage (Vd) and current (Id) waveforms. 
Integration of the product of VdId from time t1 to t2 gives the 
value of ignition energy. It should be noted that the ignition 
energy does not change whether the surrounding gas is air or 
combustible mixture. Observations of ignition spark, flame 
kernel development and subsequent propagation of a near-
spherical flame front are recorded by a high-speed, high 
resolution CMOS digital camera, capable of acquiring frames 
at a maximum rate of 5000 frames/s with 512 × 512 pixel 
resolution. Before a run, methane/air mixtures are well-mixed 
in a separate mixing chamber and then fill these premixtures 
into the evacuated chamber at 1 atm. A run begins by igniting 
the mixture under the quiescent condition or at various 
turbulent intensities. 
Concerning the definition of MIE, we use the same definition 
as that used by previous studies [e.g., 1,15-17] of which MIE 
is the ignition energy of 50% ignitability at a given flow 
condition and a fixed φ. A range of ignition energy data 
between 100% and 0% ignitability is first captured and then 
continuously narrowed down to identify the ignition energy of 
50% ignitability, Eig(50%) ( ≡  MIE). In this study, each data 
point of Eig(50%) for a given mixture at a fixed flow condition is 
determined by more than 30 repeated runs to ensure the 
accuracy of statistics. 
2.3 The Effect of Spark-Electrode Gap 
Figure 2 shows for the first time the effect of spark-electrode 
gap on MIE for two different values of φ (= 0.6 and 0.7). Also 
plotted are previous data obtained by [15] at 2 bars, in which 
essentially same methane/air mixtures but different electrodes 
combustion at φ = 0.6 and 0.7 at different gap widths ranging 
from 2 mm to 3.5 mm. It is found that the gap width of about 
2.6 mm has roughly the smallest value of MIE (= 2.14 mJ), 
which should be comparable to the quenching distance of 
methane at φ = 0.6 when the stainless-steel needle-end 
electrodes are used. For the case of φ = 0.7, the smallest 
Eig(50%) (= 0.727 mJ) occurs around 2.5 ~ 2.6 mm. Therefore, 
in this study the electrode gap is kept constant at 2.6 mm for 
turbulent methane combustion at φ = 0.7.

3. Turbulent Burning Velocities 
Turbulent burning velocities, which are extremely difficult to 
obtain accurately because thermal expansion and heat losses at 
the flame front may induce global as well as local changes of 
the turbulent flow field. Consequently, large scattering data of 
ST/SL are commonly observed even at a fixed u′/SL in a given 
flow configuration [1,19-21]. To reduce some difficulties, 
several researchers attempted to create high-intensity, near-
isotropic turbulent flow fields (simplest turbulence with 
unique characteristics) for observing turbulent flame 
propagation at large values of u′/SL. These experiments at least 
included the constant-volume fan-stirred explosion vessel 
flames [19], the ring-slot jet stabilized flames with weak-
swirling [21], and the turbulent Taylor-Couette flames [20]. 
Unfortunately, these flows still suffer various degrees of 
unsteadiness, inhomogeneity, or having significant mean flow 
velocity or mean strain, as discussed in [1,3]. 
Three different methods for measurements of ST, not shown in 
this paper but will be presented in the speech, include (1) near-
spherical turbulent flame propagation from point ignition (see 
Fig. 3b) using high-speed image processing system, (2) 
stabilized turbulent flame with weak swirling using high-speed 
particle imaging velocimetry, and turbulent flames 
propagating downwardly into 3-D fully developed 
homogeneous turbulence using pairs of ion-probe sensors. 
Comparisons among these three different means will be 
discussed in the presentation, revealing that the ion-probe 
method has the least uncertainty in measuring ST. Using pairs 
of ion-probe sensors in the central uniform region of the large 
fan-stirred cruciform burner, complete data sets of ST/SL as a 
function of u′/SL for both CH4/air and C3H8/air mixtures at 
various equivalence ratios (φ = 0.7~1.4 and 0.65~1.6) were 
obtained and reported [3]. Unlike previous turbulent ignition 
experiments, the ignition of given mixtures was initiated from 
the top of the long vertical vessel to generate a sizable 
premixed flame propagating downwardly through the central 
near-isotropic turbulence region without influences by the 
ignition source and the unwanted turbulence from walls. 
Figure 5 shows variations of ST/SL with u′/SL for both propane-
air and methane-air mixtures at different values of φ. For these 
experiments, each data point in Fig. 5 is obtained by averaging

cruciform burner with those obtained by earlier 
investigators using different types of burners. 
several ST measurements (at least four runs) under the same 
experimental conditions. These data first show an abrupt 
increase in ST/SL with increasing u′/SL for values of u′/SL up to 
2 at different values of φ. This dramatic increase in turbulent 
burning rates then diminishes as values of u′/SL increase above 
2. Figure 5 also compares the present ST/SL data with the 
results of three earlier experiments using different apparatuses 
[19-21]. The first compared experiment was the unsteady-
bomb data by the Leeds group, in which we plotted only the 
boundary lines from their large scattering data to indicate their 
data domain [19]. The second experiment was the weak-
swirling stabilized ring-slot jet flames experiment, in which 
values of u′/SL were up to 8, 480<ReT<1600, and φ = 0.6~0.8 
[21]. The third earlier experiment was flame propagation in 
Taylor-Couette flow [20], in which values of u′/SL were up to 
12, 70<ReT<350, and φ = 0.8~1.5, and the error bars revealed 
the scattering range of their data. As can be seen from Fig. 5, 
the present experiment covers a greater parameter range than 
hitherto used, values of u′/SL are up to 50, and ReT is up to 
18,500 over a wide range of φ for both CH4/air and C3H8/air 
mixtures. At low values of u′/SL < 2, our measurements of 
ST/SL at φ = 1 are very close to the data obtained by Bedat and 
Cheng [21], regardless of the different apparatuses and 
turbulence employed. But for u′/SL > 2, our ST/SL data are 
found to be much lower than those reported by Bedat and 
Cheng [21] and Aldredge et al. [20]. Such a difference in 
values of ST/SL among these experiments increases drastically 
with u′/SL. Our results show a strong bending effect that 
differs from the results of Ref. [21], because their data 
indicated a linear increase of ST/SL with u′/SL (no bending). 
For comparison, we have used the same correlations [19] to 
extract all our available data from Fig. 5 in the form of 
smoothed curves at different values of KaBLe and ReB T/Le , 
where Le and Re
2
T are the Lewis and Reynolds numbers and 
KaBB=0.157 Ka is the Bradley’s Karlovitz number. Results (not 
shown) reveal large uncertainties (similar to Fig. 5) due to data 
scattering of Bradley’s correlation. However, some qualitative 
similarities between ours and Bradley’s experiment can be 
noted. (1) Values of ST/SL increases as ReT/Le2 increases at a 
fixed u′/SL, showing the effect of the turbulent Reynolds 
number. (2) The slope of KaBLe curves becomes less steep as 
Ka
B
BBLe increases, and then it departs from linearity when 
u′/SL>10, showing a strong bending effect. (3) At larger values 
of ReT/Le2 (>>1000), further increasing u′/SL above 20 may 
 5. Conclusions 
We have reviewed dynamics of turbulent premixed flames 
from ignition to flame propagation and to flame global 
quenching by turbulence. All presented experimental results 
are obtained from the cruciform burner, which can provide 
homogeneous turbulence with large turbulent intensities 
greater than hitherto measured. These measurements, starting 
from turbulent ignition to turbulent burning velocities and then 
to global quenching, reveal the following. 
1. (a) Before the transition, values of MIE only increase 
gradually with u′/SL at which MIE ~ (u′/SL)0.3. Across the 
transition when u′/SL > 25 and/or Ka > 7, values of MIE 
increase abruptly at which MIE ~ (u′/SL)7. (b) There is a 
similar transition on MIE existing for both φ = 0.6 and 
0.7 due to different modes of combustion. These 
transitions occur at Ka ~ 10 which is much greater than 
the Klimov-Williams criterion (Ka = 1). (c) Values of 
MIE should be relevant to the size of the reaction zone at 
least in the beginning of combustion for which MIE ~ δ3. 
This is why a drastic increase of MIE is found in 
distributed-like or broken reaction zone regimes. Thus, 
the present finding may provide the experimental 
evidence for the existence of both thin and broken 
reaction zones regimes proposed by Peters [10]. 
2. A general correlation of the form, (ST-SL)/u′ = 0.05 Da0.61, 
is proposed, which is better than previous correlations 
covering both distributed (small Da) and corrugated 
flamelet (large Da) regimes. 
3. (a) For pure CH4/air flames, the critical value of Ka for 
global quenching of rich/lean CH4 flames must be greater 
than 9/39. Lean CH4 flames are much harder to quench 
globally than rich CH4 flames, indicating an influence of 
Le. (b) Values of Ka are very sensitive to φ, because Ka 
increases largely as φ gradually approaches towards φ =1 
from either lean or rich sides, with the maximum Ka 
occurring possibly near φ =1. 
4. Radiation heat losses can influence turbulent burning 
velocities and global quenching of premixed flames but 
in an opposite manner. Namely, RHL has much stronger 
influence on ST for rich flames than lean flames, but the 
reduction of Kac due to RHL is more profound for lean 
flames than rich flames. 
These results are important to the understanding of dynamics 
of turbulent premixed combustion.

the bottom plates (stainless steel) with a depth of 3 mm by a 
CNC machine center. After many try and error, a new flame-
holder in the central combustion region of the modified SRB 
is proposed, as can be clearly seen on Fig. 2. This design can 
generate a recirculation zone near the central combustion 
region, such that the flame flashback problem frequently 
occurred in the SRB when it is continuously operated at fixed 
φ can be greatly minimized. Thus, stable burning in the 
modified SRB can be sustained and the portable TE power 
generation with very low NOx and CO emissions can be 
established. 
Temperature distributions inside the modified SRB are 
measured using eleven K- and R-type thermocouples, as 
indicated by Ti on Fig. 2, where the subscript i with Arabic 
numerals from 1 to 11 represents various positions from the 
inlet channel to the central combustion region to the end of the 
outlet channel. These temperature data are recorded using a 
PCL-818HG data acquisition card with a GeniDAQ software 
at a sampling rate of 1 Hz. The circle symbol near the center 
of the modified SRB shows the position of the spark ignitor 
(Fig. 2). All thermocouples are inserted from the bottom plate 
to the same middle height inside the SRB. Major components 
of exhaust emissions, such as [NOx], [CO] and [CO2], are 
measured by the gas analyser. 
 
 
Figure 3 shows the setup of the palm-size portable TE 
power generator, in which two TE modules are placed 
between the modified SRB which acts as a heat source 
and the aluminum fin heat exchanger which features as 
a heat sink. The smallest TE module, HZ-2, available 
from Hi-Z Tech. Co., uses bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) 
based semiconductors, consisting of 97 thermocouples 
arranged electrically in series and thermally in parallel 
[4], having a dimension of 2.9 × 2.9 cm2 with 0.5 cm in 
thickness and 13.5 g in weight. According to Hi-Z 
Tech., the maximum power output of 2.5 W at 3.3 Volts 
for the HZ-2 module may be obtained if a compressive 
load of 200 psi and a temperature gradient of 200 oC are 
applied onto the HZ-2 module [4]. However, cautions 
need to be taken in order to have an appropriate power 
output. For instance, it is essential to carefully spread 
uniform thermal grease on both sides of the TE module 
together with two thin ceramic covers which are very

fragile. A mechanical cramping device that can provide 
200 psi compressive pressure load, as can be seen in Fig. 
3, is applied to compress the modified SRB, the TE 
modules and the heat sink. It should be noted again that 
the thin ceramic cover is very fragile and much care 
must be taken during the cramping process. Finally, the 
voltage and power output generated by the portable TE 
power generator are measured by a DC electronic load 
device. 
3 Numerical Simulation 
To simulate chemically reacting flows in the modified SRB, a 
3-D steady state numerical model using CFD-RC together 
with a four-step propane-air reaction mechanism is established 
with the consideration of heat losses. Figure 4 shows such a 
1.5-turn modified SRB model using unstructured grid 
geometry, of which both top-view and side-view outlines with 
532,591 grids of the 3-D model are presented.

turn modified SRB with a

Fig. 4. Top and side views of a 3-D numerical model 
for 1.5-turn modified SRB using CFD-RC with 532,961 
unstructured grids. 
Since the model includes a four-step chemical reaction 
mechanism, the computer time will be increased drastically 
when higher grid numbers are used. We have tested the 
sensitivity of the grid number for which 532,961 grids are 
used to obtain the results with acceptable accuracy under 
reasonable time consumption. The four-step oxidation 
mechanism for propane-air chemical reaction processes used 
by Jones & Lindstedt [5] is applied to the present simulation, 
as listed below.

stable combustion can be remained in the central combustion 
region for many hours when 60 < Re < 880 at φ = 0.5 for 
propane/air mixtures, showing the robust feature of the present 
simple flame-holder design. This makes a long time operation 
of the modified SRB possible and can therefore expand greatly 
the applicability of heat-recirculating burners. 
Figure 7 presents various contour plots just at the middle 
height plane of the 1.5-turn modified SRB using 3-D 
numerical model with colour bars showing corresponding 
values and magnitudes. Noted that the highest temperature 
zone, the pink colour zone on Fig. 7a, locates near the 
aforementioned uneven counter-rotating vortices (see Fig. 5b) 
where flame stabilizes, in good agreement with experimental 
measurements (see data of T5 on Fig. 6). Due to the space 
limit, concentration distributions are not discussed here. 
4.3 Exhaust Gas Analyses and Power Production 
Figure 8 shows experimental data for [NOx], [CO] and [CO2] 
at φ = 0.5 over a range of 250 to 760, where [CO2] is about 4%, 
[NOx] is typically less than 5 ppm when Re>500, and [CO] is 
typically less than 34 ppm when Re<500. Thus, the best 
operation condition for the present 1.5-turn modified SRB 
with very low NOx and CO emissions is operated at Re=500 
and φ=0.5. The current-voltage and power curves of the 
present portable power generator are shown on Fig. 9. Using 
two pieces of HZ-2 TE modules, an electrical power density of 
240 mW/cm2 can be easily produced, where the lighting bulb 
as shown on the annex of Fig. 9 demonstrates the usage of the 
present TE power generator.

the1.5-turn modified SRB plotted against Re at φ = 0.5. 
5 Conclusions 
This paper presents a portable modified SRB using a newly-
designed flame-holder near the central combustion region, 
such that the flashback problem frequently occurred in the 
SRB when continuously operated at fixed φ due to heat 
recirculation can be significantly improved. Thus, a long time 
operation of the modified SRB for many hours can be 
achieved, as confirmed by both temperature measurements at 
various positions in the modified SRB and numerical results. 
This new improvement is a useful contribution for the 
practical use of heat-recirculating burners. Finally, the present 
portable TE power generator using the modified SRB and lean 
propane/air fuels can easily and stably provide a power density 
of 240 mW/cm2 with very low [NOx] < 5 ppm for many hours.

Abstract 
This paper reviews dynamics of turbulent premixed flames 
from the ignition process of combustible mixtures in different 
regimes to subsequent flame initiation, development and 
propagation to flame global quenching. A transition on 
minimum ignition energy in flamelet and distributed regimes 
is first presented. Different experimental methods used to 
measure turbulent burning velocities (ST) are then discussed, 
revealing the so-called bending effect. A general correlation of 
ST in terms of turbulent straining and the Damköhler number 
is proposed. Furthermore, the effect of radiation heat losses on 
ST is briefly discussed. Finally, global quenching of premixed 
flames with turbulent straining, equivalence ratio, and 
radiative heat loss effects are reported, showing criteria of 
flame quenching by turbulence. 
1. Introduction 
Ignition is the beginning of combustion. It is the simplest way 
to appreciate turbulent premixed combustion provided that 
flame initiation, kernel formation and its subsequent 
propagation of a given combustible mixture in a controllable 
turbulence environment can be quantitatively measured. 
However, both ignition and turbulence are very difficult to 
measure quantitatively and simultaneously. But they can 
influence virtually all important properties of turbulent 
premixed flames. We shall first introduce a novel 
experimental configuration using a high-power pulse 
generator which can vary quantitatively ignition energies of a 
spark-electrode in the central position of a large cruciform 
burner. The burner equipped with a pair of counter-rotating 
fans and perforated plates at the two ends of the horizontal 
vessel can be used to generate isotropic turbulence over a very 
wide range of turbulent intensities (u′) than hitherto. 
Consequently, many direct measurements can be applied to 
obtain quantitative analysis and qualitative understanding of 
dynamics of turbulent premixed flames from ignition to flame 
kernel development to subsequent flame propagation and from 
flame stretching to global quenching [e.g., 1-8]. Thus, this 
paper reviews some of these results, including three key 
messages: (1) A transition on minimum ignition energy (MIE), 
(2) a general correlation of turbulent burning velocities (ST), 
and (3) criteria of flame quenching by turbulence. Due to the 
space limit, only the first message which was just found 
recently [8] will be given full attention in this paper followed 
by the second and third messages [1-7] with brief descriptions. 
2. Turbulent Ignition 
2.1 Combustion Modes and Ignition Energies 
It has long been anticipated that there are different modes of 
turbulent combustion which can influence all key features of 
premixed turbulent flames [9-12]. Traditionally, there are two 
major regimes, “turbulent-flamelet” and “turbulent-
distributed” regimes, which are separated by a Ka = 1 line for 
high Reynolds number turbulent flows [9]. Here Ka is the 
turbulent Karlovitz number commonly-defined as Ka = 
(u′/SL)2(ReT)−0.5 and ReT = u′LI/ν, where u′, LI, ν, and SL are the 
characteristic turbulent intensity, the integral length scale of 
turbulence, the kinematic viscosity of reactants, and the 
laminar burning velocity, respectively. This traditional 
criterion, namely Ka > 1 for the transition of combustion 
modes from flamelet to distributed, has recently been modified 
by Peters [10] based on a scaling description of the size of the 
reaction zone. He argued that flame broadening by turbulence 
in the “thin reaction zone” regime occurs only in the preheated 
zone without much influencing the reaction rate and this thin 
reaction zone regime before transforming into the “broken 
reaction zone” regime could sustain for Ka >> 1. 
How to prove experimentally the existence of the distributed-
combustion regime or the thin/broken reaction zones and to 
find the correct criterion for the transition are important issues 
for turbulent combustion. Hence, this work investigates 
experimentally different combustion modes based on 
measurements of ignition energies and observations of spark-
ignition, flame kernel development, and its subsequent flame 
propagation in a large fan-stirred cruciform burner. Particular 
interest is placed on the transition of minimum ignition energy 
(MIE) at different values of the equivalence ratio (φ). 
It is known that MIE is an extremely important property for 
safety standards as well as for the fundamental understanding 
of the ignition process of combustible mixtures [13-15]. 
Moreover, accurate MIE data are essential for optimization of 
ignition systems especially when lean premixed turbulent 
combustion is considered [16,17]. As pointed out by Sánchez, 
Liñán and their co-workers [18] in a theoretical study, MIE 
should be proportional to the volume of the reaction zone, δ3, 
where δ is the reaction zone thickness or here equivalent to the 
size of the spark-kernel. This is again because ignition is the 
beginning of combustion. The higher the ignition energy is, 
the larger the size of the spark-kernel is. 
Just presented recently at 31st CS, Shy and his co-workers [8] 
showed that measurements of MIE and observations of the 
flame kernel formation and its subsequent flame propagation 
in intense isotropic turbulence without mean velocities can 
provide an excellent opportunity to scrutinize different 
combustion modes and thus evaluate the new regime diagram 
of premixed turbulent combustion proposed by Peters [10]. In 
[8], only one complete set of MIE data for lean premixed 
turbulent combustion at φ = 0.6 over a wide range of u′/SL was 
reported. Thus, this paper aims to study the effect of φ on MIE 
by addressing the following key questions. Does the transition 
on MIE exist at a higher value of φ (= 0.7)? If so, what is the 
criterion of the MIE transition at φ = 0.7? Is it the same or 
different to that of previous data at φ = 0.6 [8]?

spark-ignition, flame kernel formation and its subsequent 
flame propagation for lean methane/air mixtures at φ = 0.7 in 
three different combustion modes, respectively the laminar 
mode (quiescent condition, where u′/SL = 0 and/or Ka = 0), the 
turbulent-flamelet mode (u′/SL = 5.4 and/or Ka ~ 0.8 < 1), and 
the turbulent-distributed mode (u′/SL = 32.6 and/or Ka ~ 10 >> 
1). In the quiescent condition (Fig. 3a), the flame kernel 
development and subsequent propagation of flame fronts 
remain quasi-symmetric with respect to the electrode having 
approximately spherical geometry during all periods of time 
studied. For the turbulent-flamelet mode, such as the one on 
Fig. 3b, flames are highly corrugated and cellular because the 
Lewis number is less than unity. We found that flame kernels 
from initiation to development up to 10 ms are essentially the 
same for both turbulent-flamelet and laminar modes even 
when values of u′/SL are as much as 24 corresponding to Ka ~ 
6 (see Figs. 3a and 3b). Similar results were also reported by 
[9,11]. By comparing these averaged radii of expanding flame 
fronts in both laminar and turbulent-flamelet modes at the 
 
same instants (Figs. 3a and 3b), it can be clearly seen that 
turbulence can increase flame propagation speeds to a value 
much higher than laminar flames can achieve. For very intense 
turbulence level where u′/SL = 32.6 and Ka >> 1 (Fig. 3c), 
significantly higher ignition energies are required to ignite the 
same methane/air mixtures at φ = 0.7. The development of 
turbulent flame kernel takes only several milliseconds after the 
spark-discharge, and the flame kernel may occur at random 
positions slightly outside the electrode gap (see the image at 4 
ms on Fig. 3c). Furthermore, from images at 10 ms up to 20 
ms on Fig. 3c, distributed propagation flames with filiform 
edges (highly dispersive and fragmental) are observed, which 
are quite different to turbulent-flamelet flames of clear-cut 
structures. 
2.5 Minimum Ignition Energy in Flamelet and 
Distributed Regimes 
Figure 4 shows a complete data set of MIE as a function of 
u′/SL ranging from 0 to about 35 for lean turbulent methane 
combustion at φ = 0.7 (black circles). Also plotted are the MIE 
curve at φ = 0.6 (white circles) for comparison. Both MIE 
values at the quiescent condition (u′/SL = 0) are marked on the 
ordinate with white and black triangular symbols, which are 
2.14 mJ and 0.727 mJ for φ = 0.6 and 0.7, respectively. All 
MIE data at φ = 0.7 are much smaller than that of φ = 0.6 at 
any fixed values of u′/SL. A transition on MIE for lean 
turbulent methane combustion at φ = 0.7 is found to occur 
around u′/SL > 25 corresponding to Ka > 7, similar to that 
found in [11] for φ = 0.6. Before the transition, values of MIE 
at φ = 0.7 only increase gradually from about 0.73 to 1.7 mJ 
when values of u′/SL increase from 0 to about 20, at which 
Eig(50%) ~ (u′/SL)0.3. Across the transition, values of MIE at φ 
=0.7 increase abruptly from about 4 mJ to 42 mJ when values 
of u′/SL only increase from about 25 to 32, at which Eig(50%) ~ 
(u′/SL)7. The log-log plot of Eig(50%) verse u′/SL clearly shows a 
drastic increase of the power constant jumping from 0.3 to 7, 
as shown on Fig. 4. However, more experiments need to be 
conducted near the transitional region between u′/SL ~ 20 and 
u′/SL ~ 24 for clarifying the precise position of the transition.

result in a decrease of ST/SL. In order to minimize large 
uncertainties of scattering data, a general correlation is 
proposed [3], of which all our available data from Fig. 5 can 
be best approximated by (ST-SL)/u′ = 0.05 Da0.61, where Da is 
the turbulent Damköhler number, a ratio of the chemical 
reaction rate to the turbulent strain rate based on the turbulent 
integral length scale. This correlation, which is a general 
expression that covers a wide range of strain rates and Lewis 
numbers, is found to be much better than hitherto proposed. 
The approximation covers both turbulent-distributed (small 
values of Da) and turbulent-flamelet (large values of Da) 
regimes. Thus, such correlation is better than Bradley’s 
correlation, in which values of (ST-SL)/u′ are only scattered 
from about 0 to 2.6 within a wide range of Da = 0~600, 
regardless of different mixture compositions. 
We have also investigated effects of radiation heat losses 
(RHL) from small (N2-diluted) to large (CO2-diluted) on ST, in 
which many premixed CH4/diluent/air flames at the same 
laminar burning velocity SL = 0.1 m/s for both lean (φ = 0.7) 
and rich (φ = 1.4) cases were carried out in the cruciform 
burner [7]. It is found that the larger the radiation losses, the 
smaller values of ST. This decreasing effect is augmented by 
increasing u′/SL and is particularly pronounced for rich CH4 
flames. Moreover, measurements of chemiluminescence 
intensities for these turbulent propagating CH4/diluent/air 
flames using the photomultiplier showed that the peak light 
intensities of CH* and C2* emitters are qualitatively correlated 
with these aforementioned ST data of lean and rich turbulent 
CH4/diluent/air propagating flames, respectively. The reader is 
directed to Ref. [7] for detail treatment. 
4. Global Quenching 
Global quenching of premixed CH4/air flames with turbulent 
straining, equivalence ratio, and radiation heat loss effects was 
also investigated in the cruciform burner [6]. Several CH4/air 
flames with different degrees of radiative heat loss, from small 
(N2-diluted) to large (CO2-diluted), were investigated. Each 
case covers a range of φ with u′/SL up to 100, in which high 
rates of strain are achieved until ultimately global quenching 
of flames occurs. The same Karlovitz number, defined in §2, 
is used to quantify global quenching boundaries of these 
turbulent flames, please see Fig. 6. Across the transition of 
global quenching, the remaining CH4 concentration was found 
to increase drastically for both rich and lean cases. The critical

CH4/air flames at φ =0.6 whose Le 0.97. Thus, lean CH≈ 4 
flames are much harder to quench globally than rich CH4 
flames, indicating an influence of Le. For pure CH4/air flames, 
the critical value of Ka for global quenching of rich/lean CH4 
flames must be greater than 9/39. Values of Ka are very 
sensitive to φ, because Ka increases largely as φ gradually 
approaches towards φ =1 from either lean or rich sides, with 
the maximum Ka occurring possibly near φ =1. By comparing 
N2- and CO2-diluted flames of the same SL, as presented in Fig. 
7, it is found that global quenching of lean/rich CH4 flames 
is/is not influenced by the radiation heat loss, respectively. 
The larger the radiative heat loss, the smaller the value of Ka 
for lean CH4 flames, in which values of Ka decrease from 
about 25~32 (N2-diluted) to about 19~25 (CO2-diluted) where 
SL≈0.1 m/s and φ =0.62~0.72. On the other hand, Ka≈8 for 
both N2- and CO2-diluted rich CH4 flames where SL≈0.1 m/s 
and φ =1.20~1.45. These experimental results are important to 
the understanding of global quenching processes for turbulent 
premixed combustion.

Abstract 
This paper presents a portable modified Swiss-roll burner 
(SRB) using a new flame-holder design near its central 
combustion region with openings to both spiral counterflow 
reactant gas and exhaust gas channels. Thus, the flashback 
problem, frequently occurred in SRB when it was 
continuously operated at a fixed equivalence ratio due to heat 
recirculation, can be greatly improved, achieving a long-time 
stable burning as confirmed by temperature measurements at 
various positions in the modified SRB. [NOx] and [CO] 
emissions are also measured at the exit of the product channel. 
Furthermore, a 3-D numerical model using CFD-RC together 
with a four-step propane-air reaction mechanism is established 
to simulate chemically reacting flows in the modified SRB 
with the consideration of heat losses, revealing reasonably 
good agreement with experimental data. Finally, the present 
portable TE power generator using the modified SRB as a heat 
source and an aluminum-fin heat sink can stably provide a 
power density of 240 mW/cm2 with very low [NOx] < 5 ppm 
for many hours. 
1 Introduction 
In 1974, Lloyd & Weinberg [1] proposed a 2-D Swiss-roll 
burner (SRB), consisting of a central combustion region with 
openings to a reactant gas channel and a product gas channel 
that are coiled around each other in a toroidal counterflow 
configuration which featured heat-recirculation with the 
advantage of the extension of lean flammability limit. 
However, very few commercial or practical combustion 
devices using this novel SRB could be found. Probably, this is 
because stabilizing flames in the central combustion region of 
the SRB was very difficult to achieve, for which the flashback 
problem may occur when the SRB was continuously operated 
at a fixed equivalence rate (φ) due to heat recirculation. Until 
2001, Ronney and his co-workers [2] proposed to further use 
the concept of SRB for a possible development of a MEMS 
power generator using thermoelectric (TE) modules together 
with catalytic combustion. Other researchers also used the 
SRB as a means for the development of MEMS power 
generator [3]. Nowadays, the concept of SRB has again drawn 
much attention in the combustion community. 
To minimize the aforementioned flashback problem in the 
SRB, this paper presents a newly-designed flame-holder 
(modified SRB) which features stable combustion. The goal is 
to apply lean propane/air mixtures in a portable modified SRB 
(heat source) together with an aluminum-fin heat sink that 
provide the necessary temperature gradient for TE modules in 
generating stable long-time (~ 24 hours) power output for 
small devices. 
For a typical SRB, a run began when fuel and air mixtures are 
entering and flowing through a reactant turning channel. Then, 
mixtures are ignited in the centre of the SRB, following that 
the burned gases are exhausted out of an interlacing product 
turning channel. We have tested many SRBs with different 
sizes and turns using a variety of fuels, such as C3H8, CH4 or 
H2. It was found that flames in the SRB are rather unstable, in 
which the flame flashback usually occurs when the SRB is 
continuously operated at a fixed φ for a period of time, from a 
few minutes to about 15 min depending on the value of φ 
and/or the flow rate. In order to stabilize flames in the center 
of SRB, one possibility is to modulate carefully the value of φ 
during the operation, but this greatly limits the practical 
application of the SRB. 
Alternatively, this study will show by just bending 
appropriately the reactant and product channels near the 
central combustion region of the SRB which can act as a flame 
holder, such that flame stabilization and stable combustion in 
the modified SRB can be sustained for many hours. 
Experiments are carried out using lean propane/air mixtures in 
the modified SRB. As many as eleven R- and K-type 
thermocouples positioned around the reactant and product 
channels as well as the central combustion zone near the 
newly-designed flame hold are applied to measure temperature 
distributions in the modified SRB. Emissions at the exit of the 
product channel are measured using the gas analyzer. 
Moreover, a 3-D numerical model using CFD-RC together 
with a four-step propane/air reaction mechanism with the 
consideration of heat losses is established to simulate 
chemically reacting flows in the modified SRB. Both 
experimental and numerical results confirm the existence of 
recirculation zones generated by the aforementioned flame 
holder where flames are stabilized. Finally, a small modified 
SRB combining with TE modules and the heat sink which can 
be used to develop a palm-size portable power generator, 
capable of generating a stable power density of 240 mW/cm2 
for many hours, will be presented. 
2 Experimental 
Figure 1 shows the experimental setup of the modified SRB, 
including a fuel/air supply system regulated by propane and 
air flow controlled meters, a mixing chamber filled up with 
tiny metal balls, an ignition system which can be placed either 
on the top or the bottom of the modified SRB, a temperature 
recording system for multi-thermocouple measurements, and a 
gas analyzer at the exit of the product channel. In this study, 
lean propane mixtures are used in a 1.5-turn near-square spiral 
counterflow burner because propane fuel has liquid form 
having high density and easy to carry. The right part of Fig. 1 
is the assembly of the modified SRB which consists of two 
bent sheets of 0.5 mm thick stainless steel (thermal 
conductivity k ≈ 14.6 W/m-K at 300K) forming the 1.5-turn 
near-square spiral counterflow burner with 8 cm × 8 cm × 5 
cm tall. Both inlet and outlet channels of 10 mm in width are 
sealed by the same spiral-shape grooves carved on the top and

 =ATnexp(-Ea/RT), are the pre-exponential factor, the 
temperature exponent, and the activation energy, respectively. 
Furthermore, concerning the effect of heat losses, the heat 
transfer model uses a heat transfer coefficient of 10 W/(m2K) 
for natural convection and a constant emissivity of 0.35 for 
radiative heat loss on all surfaces of the modified SRB in the 
present study. 
4 Results and Discussion 
4.1 Velocity Distributions, Recirculation Vortices, and 
Flame Stabilization Zones 
Figure 5 presents numerical velocity fields on the plane just at 
the middle height of the 1.5-turn modified SRB for both (a) 
cold flow and (b) hot flow simulations, where the inlet 
velocity is fixed at 1 m/s with Re = 630 based on the channel 
width (10 mm) for both unreacting and reacting flows. For the 
reacting case, propane/air mixtures at φ = 0.5 are used. It can 
be seen from Fig. 5(a) that there are two stationary but uneven 
counter-rotating vortices generated by the newly-designed 
flame-holder. The dominant larger vortex just recirculates near 
the central combustion region of the 1.5-turn modified SRB, 
while the smaller vortex counter-rotates near the end of the 
reactant channel. After these two uneven counter-rotating 
vortices, the flow continues to flow through the product 
channel and exits from the outlet. Also presented in the annex 
of Fig. 5(a) is the experimental flow visualization photograph 
at Re 60 using the blue dye in a hydraulic platform (not 
shown), which further confirms the existence of stationary 
uneven conter-rotating vortices for the unreacting case. 
≈
For chemically reacting flows, the simulated velocity 
distribution obtained by using the aforementioned four-step 
propane/air reaction mechanism, as displayed on Fig. 5(b), 
shows that flow velocities are largely increased due to large 
thermal expansion via combustion just near the core region of 
uneven counter-rotating vortices. Thus, here we modify the 
velocity scale of the arrow indicator from 1 m/s on Fig. 5(a) to 
5 m/s on Fig. 5(b) to better demonstrate largely increasing 
velocities in the product channel to the outlet. For comparison, 
the annex of Fig. 5(b) shows a real combustion case under the 
same conditions as numerical simulations (φ = 0.5 and Re = 
630), where the quartz window on the top plate of the 
modified SRB allows a direct visualization of flame burning in 
the central combustion chamber. Both experimental and 
numerical results as shown reveal that flame can stabilize 
itself in the core region of uneven counter-rotating vortices for 
a wide range of Re varying from 60 to 880. However, the 
uneven counter-rotating vortices and thus the flame 
stabilization zone in the reacting case will move gradually 
toward the bending reactant channel when values of Re are 
reduced. The smaller value of Re is, the closer of the flame 
stabilization zone to the bending reactant channel, which will 
be discussed in more depth based on temperature 
measurements in the following subsection. 
4.2 Temperature Distributions 
Figure 6 shows temperature distributions measured by eleven 
thermocouples (TC) at various positions at the middle height 
of the 1.5-turn modified SRB, as shown on the annex, starting 
from the reactant channel (T1 ~ T4) to the central combustion 
chamber (T5 ~ T6) to the product channel (T7 ~ T11), of which 
lean propane/air mixtures at φ = 0.5 are used with a wide 
range of Re varying from 60 to 880. Only three R-type TCs at 
positions 5,6,7 are needed near the central combustion region 
because of high temperature and the other eight TCs are K-

type. There are two major points in Fig. 6. (1) The highest 
temperature (T5) measured in the 1.5-turn modified SRB 
occurs at position 5 for all values of Re studied. (2) The larger 
value of Re, the higher value of temperature at various 
measuring positions in the modified SRB. The first point 
proves experimentally the existence of the flame stabilization 
zone close to position 5. The second point reveals the 
advantages of the flame stabilization zone, which not only 
makes stable combustion possible but also shows a robust 
operation range. Note that T5 is not flame temperature (Tf). Tf 
should be higher than T5, because there are heat losses via 
these thermocouples, the top and the bottom plates, and the 
surrounding.

SRB measured by 11 thermocouples at various positions 
as shown on the annex, where lean propane-air mixtures 
at φ  = 0.5 are applied over a wide range of Re. 
Since values of velocities in recirculating vortices increase 
with Re which in turn increase flame burning velocities and 
thus heat release rates from the flame stabilization zone, T5 
remains to be the highest temperature among all 
measurements at different positions for all values of Re 
studied. For values of Re varying from about 300 to about 900, 
flame stabilization zones are very close to position 5, at which 
values of T5 are around 1100 ~ 1300 K. However, flame 
stabilization zones tend to gradually shift from position 5 to 
the bending channel on the upper right when values of Re 
decrease, such that values of T5 are reducing. For Re < 60 and 
Re > 880, flames are much less stable and only can sustain 
near the central combustion region for less than half an hour 
before flashback or blowoff occurs. On the other hand,
