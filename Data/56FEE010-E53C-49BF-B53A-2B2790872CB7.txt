Introduction 
As the dimensions of ULSI circuits shrink, there is a need for faster performance 
and higher circuit density. Multilayer interconnect structures are the trend to produce 
high-density circuits and enhance device performance. However, at high operational 
frequencies (>1GHz), the parasitic effects associated with the multilayer interconnect 
become a limiting factor for chip performance and can not be ignored [1-3]. 
The parasitic effects of the multilayer interconnect are comprised of resistance with 
variation due to the skin effect at high frequencies, the self- and mutual-inductance of 
interconnects, the shunt capacitances from signal lines to ground lines, the parasitic 
capacitance resulted from the intermetal dielectric, the leakage of the dielectric material 
and substrate…etc. All result in signal distortion, propagation delay, and crosstalk noise 
[3-9]. In order to retain signal integrity at high frequencies, the requirements for the 
intermetal dielectric include: a small dielectric constant, low leakage current, low 
moisture absorption, adequate mechanical strength, simplicity of process, and ease of 
integration [10-15].  
Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) is a potential candidate of which the dielectric 
constant can be further reduced by forming a highly porous three-dimensional network 
structure [14]. The general formula for HSQ is (HSiO1.5)2n, n= 2, 3, etc., which is an 
inorganic material that can be considered as a derivative of SiO2 in which one of the 
four oxygen atoms bonded to every silicon atom is replaced by hydrogen. However, 
HSQ has many integration issues, such as: thermal dissociation of Si-H bonds, 
oxidation, plasma damage, formation of -OH bonds, absorption of water, etc. [11-13]. It 
was reported that with appropriate plasma treatments the thermal stability of HSQ could 
be enhanced [12]. Nevertheless, the plasma treatment may damage the surface and/or 
change the surface chemistry of HSQ and the reliability of the low k dielectric HSQ 
may degrade [11-13]. 
In this work, HSQ films are prepared and plasma treatments are applied to some 
specimens. The electrical properties of Al interconnect on HSQ and/or SiO2 aare 
measured and compared. The high frequency characteristics of the Cu/Ta/HSQ systems 
are studied, too. Finally, the interconnect systems with and without embedded process 
are compared. 
Experimental Procedures 
Four inch diameter p-type (100) Si wafers with nominal resistivity of 5 to 10 Ω-cm 
were used as substrate. After standard RCA cleaning, a 100nm SiO2 film was grown on 
the Si substrate. Two dielectrics, hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) and SiO2, were 
deposited on top of the SiO2/Si substrate. Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) was prepared 
by spin-coating Dow-Corning Flowable Oxide (FOX) on the wafer and then baked at 
150°C, 250°C, and 350°C for 1 minute. Annealing was performed in N2 furnace from 
350°C to 400°C for 60 minutes as described in [13]. The thickness of HSQ is about 
 3
absorbance decreases as annealing temperature increases especially after O2 plasma 
treatment. The Si-O stretching cage-like bond (1130cm-1) and Si-O bending cage-like 
bond (863cm-1) break to form Si-O stretching network bond (1070cm-1) and Si-O 
bending network bond (830cm-1), respectively. 
The test structure for insertion loss measurement has one signal line as exhibited in 
Fig. 2(a). With the ground-signal-ground probes, insertion loss (dB/mm) is obtained 
from the S-parameters S21s and S11s where the subscript s denotes one signal line.  
Insertion loss = 10×log[S21s2/(1-S11s2)] / length        (dB/mm) 
Specimens with 400oC-annealed HSQ dielectric have the smallest insertion loss, i.e., 
the largest S21s, among all the specimens studied. However, O2 plasma treatment 
increases the insertion loss of the interconnect, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Specimens with 
400oC-annealed HSQ have the smallest insertion loss, however, plasma treatment raises 
the conductance of the 400oC-annealed HSQ. Our work [13] indicates that exposure to 
the O2 plasma causes Si-H bonds to break. The breaking of Si-H bonds leads to the 
formation of dangling bonds which absorb water rapidly to form Si-OH bonds when the 
HSQ is exposed to air after the O2 plasma treatment [13].  
Crosstalk noises between two interconnect lines are measured with the test structure 
shown in Fig. 3(a) where signal is applied to the aggressor line (S1) and coupling 
voltage across the victim line (S2) is measured. The S-parameter (S21d) is employed to 
evaluate the coupling between the two lines. As exhibited in Fig. 3(b), S21d increases 
with the increase of frequency, and specimens with the 400oC-annealed HSQ films have 
the lowest S21d at frequencies below 15GHz. While those with 350oC-annealed HSQ 
films and 400oC-annealed HSQ films followed by O2 plasma treatment show less 
coupling at higher frequencies (>15GHz). Increasing the spacing/width ratio of the 
interconnect decreases the coupling as seen in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The transient 
voltages of the victim line are evaluated by the inverse Fourier transform when a step 
voltage is applied to the aggressor interconnect. As exhibited in Fig. 4(a), specimens 
with 400oC-annealed HSQ films have a smallest transient peak (i.e., crosstalk noise) of 
0.121V. The transient peaks are 0.136V, 0.136V, and 0.130V, for specimens with 
350oC-annealed HSQ films, 400oC-annealed HSQ films followed by O2 plasma 
treatment, and PECVD SiO2, respectively. The first transient peak is mainly caused by 
capacitive coupling, and the following oscillations are attributed to both capacitive and 
inductive coupling. 
As mentioned previously, among the specimens studied, samples with 
400oC-annealed HSQ have the smallest signal attenuation and crosstalk noise from 
100MHz to 15GHz. However, at frequencies above 15GHz, less coupling is observed 
for specimens with 350oC-annealed HSQ or O2 plasma-treated HSQ. A figure of merit 
(FOM) is thus defined to evaluate the high frequency performance of the interconnect 
on the basis of both signal attenuation and crosstalk noise.

Conclusions 
Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) films prepared under various conditions were 
integrated with Al interconnects. The dielectric constant of HSQ films annealed at 
400oC is smaller than those of HSQ films annealed at 350cC or subjected to O2 plasma 
bombardment. The FTIR spectra suggest that absorption of water via open pores or by 
dangling bonds cause the increase of the dielectric constant. The high frequency 
characteristics of the Al/HSQ interconnect system are studied and compared to those of 
the Al/SiO2 system on the basis of the measured S-parameters. The Al/HSQ system with 
400oC-annealed HSQ exhibits smaller insertion loss, lower crosstalk noise, and smaller 
signal propagation delay than the Al-SiO2 system does.  
For the Cu-interconnect system, NH3 plasma treatment is employed to form silicon 
nitride on HSQ films to prevent the diffusion of oxygen and oxidation of copper. 
However, the effect of NH3 plasma treatment is multiple. Besides forming SiNx, plasma 
bombardment breaks the Si-H bonds and result in hygroscopic Si dangling bonds. The 
barrier height for Schottky emission increases from 1.27eV of the as-cured HSQ to a 
maximum of 1.39eV of the 120sec plasma treated HSQ and then decreases to 1.18eV of 
the 1800sec plasma treated HSQ. Among various specimens studied, the smallest 
insertion loss is 1.97dB/mm at 20GHz for the 400°C-annealed Cu/Ta/HSQ 
(NH3-plasma-treated for 50sec). Appropriate NH3-plasma bombardment helps to form a 
thin SiNx barrier layer which prevents the diffusion of oxygen without increasing the 
dielectric constant of the Cu-HSQ interconnect system.
