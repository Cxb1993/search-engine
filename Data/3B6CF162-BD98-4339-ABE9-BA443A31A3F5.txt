Abstract—In recent years, single-inductor dual-output 
(SIDO) converters have found applications in hand-held 
electronic devices. The focus of the paper is about the 
modeling and the design of the feedback control loop for a 
voltage-mode SIDO buck converter working in continuous 
conduction mode. A small-signal model was developed and 
verified by simulations and experimental results. This model 
is practically useful in designing the feedback compensation 
and predicting the closed-loop performances including 
circuit stability, line regulation, and output impedances.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) 
non-isolated DC-DC converters have been reported [1, 7-
10]. Because of circuit simplicity and low cost, this class 
of converters has found low-power applications requiring 
multiple-output voltages such as hand-held electronic 
devices. The operation of SIDO converters can be 
classified into two modes: discontinuous conduction mode 
(DCM) and continuous conduction mode (CCM), 
depending upon the inductor current waveform [15-18]. 
SIDO converters with DCM operation work just like two 
independent converters with the inductor multiplexing 
current to different outputs and can be modeled and 
designed similar to conventional buck converters. SIDO 
converters with CCM operation, however, present 
problems with cross-coupling between the two outputs in 
the feedback [16-18] which makes it hard for the design of 
feedback control circuit [2-6]. The focus of the present 
paper is to model the feedback control loop for a SIDO 
buck converter working in CCM mode. In this paper, the 
operation of the CCM SIDO buck converter will be 
reviewed first. The DC analysis of the SIDO converter is 
presented. A small-signal model will be developed and 
verified by simulations and hardware. This model is 
practically useful in designing the feedback compensation 
and predicting the closed-loop performances including 
circuit stability, line regulation, and output impedances. 
 
II. OPERATION OF SIDO BUCK CONVERTERS 
A. Circuit Diagram 
Fig. 1 shows a circuit diagram of a SIDO buck 
converter with two voltage feedback loops. Fig. 2 shows 
the gate-drive timing diagram and the inductor current 
waveform in CCM mode. Depending on the input-voltage, 
output-voltage and load conditions, the circuit CCM 
operation can be classified into three categories according 
to the relative magnitude of the two duty cycles of the two 
respective MOSFET switches Q1 and Q2. When D1 is 
greater than D2, the operation is called Class-A. When D1 
is equal to D2, the operation is called Class-B, When D1 is 
less than D2, it is called Class-C. Fig. 2 shows the 
waveforms for the three classes of operation.  
 
B. Description of operation 
 
Class-A: D1>D2 
In Class-A operation, Q1 and Q2 are both turned on 
during the period t1a, and the inductor current iL ramps up 
with the slope of (Vin-Vo1)/L and the diode DB is reverse-
biased because Vo2 is greater than Vo1. During the period 
t2a when Q1 is still on but Q2 is off, the inductor current iL 
ramps up with the slope of (Vin-Vo2)/L and flows to Vo2 
through diode DB. During t3a when both Q1 and Q2 are off, 
the inductor current is flowing through both diodes DA 
and the DB to discharge to Vo2, and iL ramps down with 
the slope of Vo2/L. In this class of operation, the inductor

C. DC voltage gain and determination of operating 
class 
 
Using the “pulse width modulation (PWM) switch 
model” [19], the expressions for DC voltage gains can be 
derived. The two DC voltage gain expressions are shown 
by (1) and (2), where R1 and R2 are load resistances. It’s 
noted that these expressions were obtained under the 
assumption that both the transistors and the diodes are 
ideal switches.

By solving simultaneous equations (1) and (2), D1 and 
D2 can be represented by (3) and (4). It can be seen that 
the duty cycles depend on both the voltages and the load 
conditions even for a CCM operation of this type of 
converter. Depending on the relative magnitude of the two 
duty cycles, the three classes of waveforms shown in Fig.2 
can be determined.

III. SMALL-SIGNAL MODEL 
Because there are two independently-controlled active 
switches involved, the control model of conventional 
buck converters doesn’t apply anymore. A new model 
was derived in this paper using the “pulse width 
modulation (PWM) switch model” concept [19] and also 
confirmed by “state-space averaging method” [20].  
This model applies to Class-A, Class-B and Class-C 
operations. Fig. 3 shows the control block diagram and 
Table I summarizes the symbol definitions, the 
expressions of the transfer function and the analytical 
results describing the dependencies of the various 
converter closed-loop performances on loop gains, 
including   closed-loop line-to-output, closed-loop self-
output impedances and closed-loop cross-output 
impedances for both outputs. There are two loop gains T1 
and T2 measured at the designated location in Fig. 3. 
Symbols Fm1, and A1 represent, respectively, the 
modulator gain of the PWM block and the compensator 
gain of Loop_1. Same rule applies to Fm2 and A2. The 
parameters in the Table II can be classified into three 
groups: power-stage parameters, feedback parameters, and 
line-load dc conditions. D1 and D2 values can be found 
from (3) and (4).

IV. COMPENSATION DESIGN 
The goal of the compensator design is to find proper 
compensator gains A1 and A2 such that the loop gains T1 
and T2 meet the bandwidth requirements with specified 
phase margins. Because of the intertwining of the two 
loops, the compensator design is no longer as straight-
forward as that in a single-output converter [11-14]. 
However, the complexity can be reduced if TX and TY are 
both much larger than unity, then the loop gains T1 and T2 
can be simplified as shown in (5) and (6). The transfer 
functions inside the brackets of the two equations can be 
expressed by converter parameters as shown by (7) and 
(8). Notice that in the expression G1(s), there are one pole 
and one equivalent-series-resistance (ESR) zero. 
Therefore, the compensation gain A1 should provide one 
canceling zero, one canceling pole and a low-frequency 
pole to make the loop gain T1 stable by crossing 0dB at 
minus20 dB/decade slope. In the expression G2(s), there 
are two poles and one ESR zero. This can be obtained by 
substituting in Req2(s) in (8) by using the expression of 
Req2(s) at the bottom of Table I. The two poles can be 
obtained by solving the resultant second-order algebraic 
equation of the denominator. The compensation gain T2 
uses the same way to let loop gain T2 stable.

II.   DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION OF A SIDO BUCK 
CONVERTER 
A SIDO buck converter can be operated in both continuous 
conduction mode (CCM) [2], [5]-[10] and discontinuous 
conduction mode (DCM) [11]-[12], just like a conventional 
single-output buck converter. Fig. 2 shows the waveforms of 
the inductor current and transistor duty cycles with time-
multiplexing control scheme [13] for both the CCM and DCM 
operations. According to the relative magnitude of transistor 
Q1 duty cycle D1, and transistor Q2 duty cycle D2, the 
waveforms are given for three cases: Case A (D1<D2), Case B 
(D1=D2), and Case C (D1>D2).

Fig. 2. The operating waveforms of a SIDO buck converter for both the CCM 
and DCM operations: (a) Case A (D1<D2); (b) Case B (D1=D2); and (c) Case 
C (D1>D2) 
 
In the CCM operation, there are three periods: T1 is the 
duration when both transistors Q1 and Q2 are on. During this 
period, both diodes Da and Db are off and the power is 
provided to VO1 only. T2 is the period when only one of the 
transistors is in conduction. If Q1, instead of Q2, is in 
conduction, then the inductor current flows through Db and the 
power is provided to VO2 only. Otherwise, it flows through Da 
and the power is provided to VO1 only. T3 is the period when 
both transistors are off. The inductor current is then flowing 
through Da and Db and the power is provided only to VO2. 
Notice that D1 is therefore equal to T1/TS or (T1+T2)/TS (where 
TS is the conversion switching period), depending upon 
whether it is Case A, B or Case C. Same situation applies to D2. 
It is also clear that there is no T2 period for Case B. All of 
these are indicated along with the waveforms in Fig. 2. For the 
DCM operation, there is an additional period Td when the 
inductor current stays at zero and none of the switches is on. 
And the duty cycle Dd is defined as Td/TS. Just like a single-
output counterpart, a SIDO operation is moving from CCM 
toward DCM as load current levels are reduced or input 
voltage is increased. 
 
III.   SIDO BUCK CONVERTER DC EQUATIONS 
In this section, DC equations of the SIDO converters in 
steady-state operation will be derived. The derivation starts 
with an inductor current waveform which varies according to 
the case of converter operation described in Section II. Only 
one case, Case A, will be used as an example for detailed 
derivation. As mentioned earlier, semiconductor switch 
conduction voltage drops will be included in the derivation. 
 
A.   Derivation for the DC Equations in CCM 
Fig. 3 shows the inductor current waveform of Case A of 
CCM. From the waveform, the input average current Iin is the 
average of the Q1 current, i.e., the area below the inductor 
current waveform during T1 period divided by the total period 
TS. This leads to (1). Similarly, (2) can be obtained by 
equating the output current IO1 to the average of the inductor 
current of the Q2 current. And (3) can be obtained by equating 
the output current IO2 to the average of the Db current. In the 
equations, Vin is the input voltage, VD and VDS are respectively, 
the conduction voltage drops of diodes and transistors, and VO1 
and VO2 are the output voltages. IX is the valley of the inductor 
current as shown by Fig. 3. And TS is the conversion switching 
period.

cycle values from specified output voltage values. This is 
because to use the proper equations, one needs to know in 
advance in which mode (CCM or DCM) and which Case (A or 
B or C) the converter is operated. This information can only be

Fig. 2.  A proposed algorithm to determine the converter operating mode and duty cycles 
 
found out with an elaborate procedure. Fig. 5 shows a 
proposed algorithm to do that. 
Refer to the flow chart in Fig. 5. In the top block, a set of 
values including output voltages, component values, 
switching period, and input voltage are given. In Step 1, one 
assumes that the converter operates in Case C of DCM, and 
therefore uses the corresponding equations to find out the 
values D1, D2 and Dd. In Step 2, Dd is used to determine the 
converter operation mode. If Dd is within the range of [0, 1], 
then it is a DCM operation. If not, then it is a CCM operation.

A.   Determination of the Minimum Operable Input 
Voltage 
Section IV gave three examples of plotting the various duty 
cycle values versus the input voltage for given converter 
specifications of output variables (VO1, VO2, IO1, and IO2), 
power stage component values (VD, VDS and L), and the 
conversion switching period (TS). From the examples, one can 
find out the converter operating mode (CCM or DCM), the 
various duty cycle values, and minimum operable input 
voltage Vin_min. However, it would be much more convenient 
to the designers if Vin_min can be calculated by an analytical 
expression. The paragraph below will address this issue. 
For the first two examples, both of the CCM operation, 
Vin_min occurs when D1 is equal to unity. Therefore, by setting 
D1=1 in (8) and (9) and eliminating D2 for the two equations, 
(16) can be obtained.

Equations (8) and (9), instead of (6) and (7), are used 
because D1>D2 under this condition. Similarly, for example 3, 
a DCM operation, Vin_min occurs when the curve of D1 
intersects (1-Dd). Therefore, using (13) to (15) and D1=(1-Dd), 
and eliminating D2 and Dd from the three equations, one can 
obtain Vin_min. It turns out, surprisingly, (16) applies to both 
the CCM and DCM operations. That must not be a 
coincidence. Therefore, a separate approach described in the 
following paragraph will be used to confirm the result. 
By rearranging (4), which is derived from the principle of 
conservation of energy, (17) can be obtained.

For given converter specifications, the right-hand side of 
(17) is fixed, regardless of Vin value. Therefore, as Vin is 
reduced, Iin value should increase. However, it will be proved 
later that the maximum input average current Iin_max is equal to 
(IO1+IO2). Therefore, Vin_min can be obtained by substituting 
the Iin in (17) for Iin_max which is equal to (IO1+IO2). The result 
is identical to (16) obtained earlier using different approaches. 
In the next paragraph, it will be proved that Iin_max is indeed 
equal to (IO1+IO2) for all operating cases and for both the 
CCM and DCM operations. 
 
B.   Physical Explanation for the Derivation of Minimum 
Operable Input Voltage 
In this paragraph, it will be proved that Iin_max is equal to 
(IO1+IO2). Referring to the inductor current waveforms in Fig. 
2, assume that the area under the waveform of Period T1, T2, 
and T3 are, respectively, A1, A2, and A3. From Fig. 1 and the 
description of the converter operation given in Section II, one 
can see that the inductor current flows to VO1 or VO2 and 
returns through Q1 or Da. Current flows to VO1 during Q2 “on” 
time and to VO2 during Q2 “off” time, and the input current 
flows during Q1 “on” time. Take Case A of CCM as an 
example, IO1 is then equal to (A1+A2)/TS; IO2 is equal to A3/TS; 
and Iin is equal to A1/TS.

(b)  
 
Fig. 9. Inductor current waveforms under the minimum operable input 
voltage Vin_min in (a) CCM operation; and (b) DCM operation 
 
Therefore, (IO1+IO2) is equal to (A1+A2+A3)/TS which is 
always larger than or equal to Iin. They are equal only when 
D1=1, i.e., when the input current flows for the entire period.

Fig. 13 shows the measured waveforms for Example 3. 
The waveforms reveal the three cases of duty cycles in DCM 
under different input voltage values and the mix-voltage 
conversion can be achieved under this operating condition. 
Moreover, when the converter operates in DCM under 
minimum operable input voltage, D1 is equal to (1-Dd) as 
shown in Fig. 13-(c). The converter ceased to regulate when 
the input voltage dropped below 2.36V.
