Abstract
A simulation experiment is frequently performed to estimate a metamodel, which
is a functional relationship between the mean response of the simulation model and a
set of simulation inputs. Variance swapping rules (VSRs), which assign pseudo-random
number streams in simulation experiments, are often used to increase the precision of the
functional relationship. This paper proposes a five-class VSR, which classifies all variances
of the effects estimators into five classes for linear metamodels of 2k factorial designs.
The five-class VSR induces correlations among all blocks for which all design points
have a special correlation structure. This five-class correlated-blocks VSR is a general-
ization of all existing VSRs, which are viewed as one, two, or three-class VSRs in terms
of the variances of the effects estimators. The five-class rule provides a better VSR than
the existing VSRs in that it allows one to make a finer distinction among all effects for
which the variances are not allowed to be swapped in three-class VSRs.

Suppose we consider a 2k factorial design in which the mean effect, main effects, and
some interaction effects need to be estimated. Through appropriate assignment of PRN
streams to design points, we can systematically allocate the variances of the effects esti-
mators. Schruben (1979) showed that the sum of the variances of independent estimators
is a constant no matter what assignment of PRN streams is used. That is, if one decreases
the variances of some estimators, the variances of certain other estimators will increase
simultaneously. The variances are “swapped” rather than “reduced” for the important
estimators, such as the estimators of the mean effect and the main effects, in such a
technique. The methodology of assigning PRNs is called a PRN assignment strategy or
correlation induction strategy, or a Variance Swapping Rule (VSR). We adopt VSR to
refer to such techniques throughout this paper.
Existing VSRs include the independent random-number streams rule (IR), common
random-number streams rule (CRN), assignment rule (AR) (Schruben and Margolin
1978), multiple blocks rule (MB) (Hussey, Myers, and Houck 1987a and 1987b), and
extended multiple blocks rule (E-MB) (Song and Su 1996). In the IR rule, independent
streams are used for each design point and produce the same variance for all estimators.
That is, there is only one class of variance for all effects if the IR rule is applied. In
the CR rule, the same common streams are used for all design points and produce the
same variance for all estimators except for that of the mean effect. That is, there are two
classes of variance for all effects if the CR rule is applied. Schruben and Margolin (1978)

We observe that in applying the three-class VSRs we can not allow for variance swap-
ping among effects in the third class. Specifically, if S3 contains the highest-interaction
and some lower-interaction effects, Goal 1 and Goal 2 do not ensure that the estimators of
the lower-interaction effects have smaller variances than that for the highest-interaction,
which is considered to be the least important effect. This observation motivates us to add
a new goal to our problem.
Goal 3: Allow variance swapping among effects estimators in S3.
To attain Goal 3 as well as Goals 1 and 2, we propose a five-class VSR that induces
correlations among all blocks in which all design points have a special correlation struc-
ture. We therefore name the proposed rule the correlated-block (CB) variance swapping
rule. The CB rule allows one to make a finer distinction among the levels of interest than
does the three-class VSR. The CB rule is a generalization of conventional VSRs, including
IR, CR, AR, and MB, as reviewed above.
The organization of the rest of this paper is as follows. Section 2 describes 2k factorial
designs for simulation experiments. In Section 3, the general assumptions and the three-
class VSRs are reviewed. In Section 4, we propose the CB rule. In Section 5, we compare
the proposed CB rule with four conventional VSRs. An example demonstrating the rule’s
efficiency is given in Section 6. Section 7 is the summary.
2. 2k Factorial Designs for Simulation Experiments
In this paper, our five-class variance swapping rules are developed for use in 2k fac-
torial designs. We focus on the 2k factorial design because it is a simple and important
design. It is normally used in the early stages of a simulation study, especially when
many factors need to be investigated. Also, it forms the basis for other more-complicated
designs.

Four fundamental assumptions concerning the assigned PRN stream sets will be made
here to simplify the strategy-performance analysis (see Schruben and Margolin 1978 for
details). These assumptions may be limiting in some real-life applications.
Assumption 1: All the sample responses driven by the PRN stream sets have equal
variances, i.e., V(Y (1)) = V(Y (2)) = · · · = V(Y (n)) = σ2.
Assumption 2: Utilization of the same PRN stream set in different design points will re-
sult in the same positive correlation between the responses, i.e., corr(Y (i)(R), Y (j)(R))
= ρ+, 0 < ρ+ < 1, for all i 6= j.
Assumption 3: The antithesis of PRN stream Ri is defined as Ri = (1 − ri1, 1 −
ri2, . . .) for i = 1, 2, . . . , g, and the set of g antithetic streams is defined as R =
(R1, R2, . . . , Rg). Any two sample responses that are respectively obtained from a
pair of antithetic-streams sets, R and R, will have the same negative correlation,
i.e., corr(Y (i)(R), Y (j)(R)) = ρ−, −1 < ρ− < 0, for all i 6= j ; and ρ+ > |ρ−| is
required to ensure the positive definiteness of ΣY .
Assumption 4: The sample responses made with two independent-streams sets, say R(1)
and R(2), have zero correlation, i.e., corr(Y (i)(R(1)), Y (j)(R(2))) = 0.
3.2 Review of Three-Class Variance Swapping Rules
The goal of the three-class variance swapping rules is to obtain good estimators of
effects of primary interest in S1 with minimum possible variances, while reducing the
variances of the effects estimators of secondary interest in S2. That is, the three-class
variance swapping rules pursue the first two goals stated in Section 1, but do not intend
to pursue Goal 3. A general procedure for the three-class variance swapping rules (see
Song and Su 1998) is summarized below.
Blocking Steps:
7
type-1 blocks. That is, the assigned streams R(1),R(2), . . . ,R(2
h−1) are
independent.
2. The “optimal” parameters (i.e., parameters to reach Goals 1 and 2):
Parameters for three-class VSRs include h; ρ1, the correlation of design points
in the same type-2 block; and ρ2, the correlation of design points in the different
type-2 blocks, while in the same type-1 block.
(a) Optimal value for h:
The optimal value for h is m, which is the maximum number of indepen-
dent defining contrasts such that no effects in set S1 are confounded. (A
systematic procedure proposed by Franklin and Bailey 1977 and Franklin
1985 can be used to find the desired defining contrasts.)
(b) Optimal values for ρi, i = 1, 2:
Ideally, the optimal values for ρ1 and ρ2 would be 1 and −1, respectively.
Practically, the maximum value of ρ1 is ρ+, the maximum possible positive
correlation of Y (i)(R) and Y (j)(R); and the maximum negative value of ρ2
is ρ−, the maximum possible negative correlation of Y
(i)(R) and Y (j)(R),
where i 6= j.
We note that both AR (Schruben and Margolin 1979) and MB (Hussey, Myers, and
Houck, 1987a and 1987b) are three-class VSRs. In AR, h = 1, ρ1 = ρ+, and ρ2 = ρ−; in
MB, h = m, ρ1 = ρ+, and ρ2 = ρ−.
The variances of estimators corresponding to the three types of effects are derived in
Song and Su (1996), namely,

(ρ+ − ρ−)σ

where In is the identity matrix of order n; Dj is an n × n diagonal matrix such that

All steps here are the same as those in the three-class procedures, except that the
highest-interaction effect is chosen as the type-2 contrast.
Assignment Steps:
1. Random Number Streams:
Steps 1 and 2 are the same as those in the three-class procedures (in Section
3.2).
Step 3. Assign a PRN stream set R(j) for one design point in Bj , j 6= i,
such that the correlation of any two experimental points in Bi and Bj
is ρ3. That is, corr(Y
(i)(R(i)), Y (j)(R(j))) = ρ3, where Y
(i) ∈ Bi and
Y (j) ∈ Bj. (A systematic procedure proposed by Song, Huang, and Chiu
2003 can be used to obtain the desired correlation.) Let the correlation of
any two experimental points in Bi and B
′
j be ρ4, where i 6= j. That is,
corr(Y (i)(R(i)), Y (j)(R
(j)
)) = ρ4, where i 6= j. The value ρ4 is determined
after ρ1, ρ2, and ρ3 are determined. We note that the relationships between
ρ1 and ρ2 (used in Steps 1 and 2) and ρ3 and ρ4 (used in Step 3) are
illustrated in Figure 1.
2. The “optimal” parameters (i.e., parameters to reach Goals 1, 2, and 3):
Parameters for CB include h and ρi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
(a) Optimal value for h:
The optimal value for h = m, which is the same as described in the three-
class procedures (in Section 3.2).
(b) Optimal values for ρi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4:
Ideally, the optimal values for ρ1 = 1, ρ2 = −1, ρ3 = 1, and ρ4 = −1
because these values result in zero variance for the first, second, and third
estimators, which can be shown from Proposition 1 below. Practically,
the maximum possible positive and negative correlations of Y (i) and Y (j),
11
D3(i, i) = 1 if βi is an interaction between type-1 and type-2 confounded effects, and is
zero otherwise.
D4(i, i) = 1 if βi is the type-2 confounded effect, and is zero otherwise.
The proof of Proposition 1 is given in Appendix A. Proposition 1 shows that there are five
types of effects. Let Si denote the set containing only the i
th type of effects, i = 1, 2, . . . , 5.
The estimators corresponding to the five types of effects are:
The “first-class” estimators: These are the estimators of non-confounded effects. These
estimators have common minimum variance (1−ρ1)σ
2/n. The number of first-class
estimators is n− 2h.
The “second-class” estimator: This is the estimator of the mean effect. The estimator
has variance {(1− ρ1)/n + [(ρ1 + ρ2) + (2
h−1 − 1)(ρ3 + ρ4)]/2
h}σ2.
The “third-class” estimators: These are estimators of type-1 confounded effects and their
generalized interactions. These estimators have common variance {(1−ρ1)/n+[(ρ1+
ρ2)− (ρ3 + ρ4)]/2
h}σ2. The number of third-class estimators is 2h−1 − 1.
The “fourth-class” estimators: These are estimators of interactions between type-1 and
type-2 confounded effects. These estimators have common variance {(1 − ρ1)/n +
[(ρ1 − ρ2)− (ρ3 − ρ4)]/2
h}σ2. The number of fourth-class estimators is 2h−1 − 1.
The “fifth-class” estimator: This is the estimator of the type-2 confounded effect. The
estimator has variance {(1− ρ1)/n+ [(ρ1 − ρ2) + (2
h−1 − 1)(ρ3 − ρ4)]/2
h}σ2.
5. Performance Comparison among VSRs
Here we compare the four existing VSRs (IR, CR, AR, MB) with the CB rule. We
use CB(h) to denote the CB rule with parameter h. The comparison results are shown
in Table 1. The second column of Table 1 shows the corresponding number of classes in
terms of the variances of the effects estimators. Specifically, the IR, CR, AR (or MB), and
CB rules are 1-class, 2-class, 3-class, and 5-class VSRs, respectively. The corresponding
13
We summarize the relationships among the five VSRs below.
1. The IR, CR, AR, and MB rules are special cases of the CB rule in that they differ
by some ρi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and the number of defining contrasts h selected. For
example, in the IR rule, all ρi = 0; and in the CR rule, all ρi = ρ+. The AR rule
is CB(h = 1, ρ3 = ρ4 = 0), and MB is CB(h = m, ρ3 = ρ4 = 0). The correlations
among design points in the four rules AR, MB, CB(h = 2), and CB(h = m) are
illustrated in Figures 2 (a) to (d), respectively.
2. AR is the simplest case of MB in that there are a minimum number of type-1 blocks
(i.e., 1) such that ρ1 6= ρ2 6= 0. CB(h = 2) is the simplest version of CB(h) in that
there are a minimum number of type-1 blocks (i.e., 2) such that ρ1 6= ρ2 6= ρ3 6= 0.
3. The sum of the total variances of effects estimators in S2 for MB is equivalent to
the sum of the total variances of effects estimators in S2 and S3 for CB(h = m).
Specifically, all effects estimators in S2 for MB have been divided into two classes
in CB(h = m, ρ3 = ρ4 = 0). This can be shown via the calculation of
2m−1σ2
[
1− ρ1
n
+
ρ1 + ρ2
2m
]
= σ2
{[
1− ρ1
n
+
(ρ1 + ρ2) + (2
m−1 − 1)(ρ3 + ρ4)
2m
]
+ (2m−1 − 1)
[
1− ρ1
n
+
(ρ1 + ρ2)− (ρ3 + ρ4)
2m
]}
4. The sum of the total variances of effects estimators in S3 for MB(h) is equivalent
to the sum of the variances of effects estimators in S4 and S5 for CB(h). That is,
all effects estimators in S3 in MB have been divided into two classes in the CB rule.
Therefore the variances between these two classes can be swapped with each other.
This can be seen via the calculation of
2m−1σ2
[
1− ρ1
n
+
ρ1 − ρ2
2m
]
= σ2
{[
1− ρ1

2m
]
+ (2m−1 − 1)
[
1− ρ1
n
+
(ρ1 − ρ2)− (ρ3 − ρ4)

Each factor is assumed to have two levels and a 24 full design is considered. Sixteen (24)
simulation runs are executed for each strategy and we repeat 30000 runs to obtain the
estimated correlations between the design points for each strategy.
We consider two cases. In Case 1, the first requirement set S1 = {A,B,C,D,BD}, and
the second requirement set S2 = {I} contains only the mean effect. Based on the assign-
ment steps given in Section 4, the “optimal” number of defining contrasts is h = m = 2.
One possible choice is to use the interactions CD andABCD as the defining contrasts. We
first use CD to partition all design points into two type-1 blocks and then use ABCD to
partition every type-1 block into two type-2 blocks. Case 1 is denoted as CB(h = m = 2).
In Case 2, S1 = {A,B,C,D} and S2 = {I} contains the mean effect. Based on the assign-
ment steps defined in Section 4, the optimal number of defining contrasts is h = m = 3.
One possible choice is to use AB,AC, and ABCD as the defining contrasts. We first use
AB and AC to partition all design points into four type-1 blocks, then use ABCD to
partition every type-1 block into two type-2 blocks. Case 2 is denoted as CB(h = m = 3).
Following the optimal value selection for correlations ρi discussed in Section 4, we obtain
the estimated correlations as follows: ρˆ1 = 1, ρˆ2 = −0.82, ρˆ3 = 0.55, and ρˆ4 = −0.55.
All results corresponding to Case 1: CB(h = m = 2) and Case 2: CB(h = m = 3) are
shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The common correlation structures for both cases
are listed in Table 2.
In Table 2, the first column lists 10 rules in which the value of ρU3 increases from 0 to
1, as stated in the second column, where ρU3 = corr(R
(i)
k , R
(j)
k ) is the correlation of the k
th
random number streams used to generate design points in different type-1 blocks i and
j, k = 1, 2, . . . , g. The third and fourth columns list the numerical values of ρˆ3 and ρˆ4.
The fifth and the sixth columns are ρˆ3 + ρˆ4 and ρˆ3 − ρˆ4, respectively. Rule 1 is equivalent
