In order to select the best image quality, several 
sub-image blocks are analyzed instead of a full image 
that contains n×n pixels. Choose an image unit that 
contains l×l numbers of pixels, and define GL (Gray 
Level) as the average gray level in an image unit: 
 
( )∑ ∑
= =
= l
i
l
j
jiO
l
GL
1 1
2 ,
1  (1) 
 
where divided by l2 is to ensure that the value of GL is 
converged; O(i,j) is the gray level of each pixel in the 
chosen image unit. We further define AGL (Average 
Gray Level) for the full image: 
 
( )∑ ∑
= =
= n
i
n
j
jiGL
n
AGL
1 1
2 ,
1  (2) 
 
where n2 is the coefficient to ensure the value of AGL 
converged. Totally m×m numbers of image units are 
gathered to form a sub-image block for image analyzing. 
If there are noise pixels in a sub-image block, there must 
have some image units containing unusual GL values 
comparing to the value AGL. Define d1 to be the 
difference between the smallest GL and the AGL, and d2 
to be the difference between the largest GL and the AGL 
as in Figures 1 and 2. If the values of d1 and d2 are larger 
than the expected values, as seen in Figure 1, the image 
is noise involved. On the contrary, as shown in Figure 2, 
the image has reasonable good quality. A structural 
degree (SD) is defined to referee whether an image is 
noise involved or not, 
 ( )[ ] ( )[ ]GLAGLAGLGLSD minmax −−−=  (3) 
 
A sub-image block is noise involved when its SD index 
is larger than expected. The SD index is utilized in this 
research to filter out the noise involved image blocks. 
Among the noise-free image blocks, one with best 
quality is selected according to the value of background 
luminance (BL) [3]: 
 ( ) ( )GLGLBL minmax −=  (4) 
 
An image has a better quality than the others, if its BL 
value is larger than that of the others. 
 
 
2.2 Image Recovery 
 
A low-cost CMOS sensor is always equipped with a 
universal lens, and applied to observe objects in a large 
range of distance without tuning the focus of the lens. 
However, the usage of universal lens will induce the 
problem of image distortion. As shown in Figure 3, the 
grids in the center of the picture are enlarged, while those 
in the corners are squeezed. The distortion ratio is a 
nonlinear function of the radius from the center of the 
picture, as shown in Figure 4. A polynomial equation is 
applied to correct the pixel positions in the selected 
image,

where r is the radius from the center of the image to the 
position of the pixel; R is the corrected radius; The 
coefficients a0, …, an can be determined by using a 
curve-fitting method [7].  
 
Another image problem is caused by perspective project 
of lens. When two points locate at different heights from 
the sensor, they could not be found the correct position 
by the same perspective transformation matrix, as shown 
in Figure 5. An offset is compensated for the height 
difference in the transformation matrix to get the correct 
pixel position.

3.  Machine Vision System 
 
The developed machine vision system consists of an 
ET21X110A CMOS vision [11] and a Stratix EP1S10 
FPGA chip [12]. The vision module, as shown in Figure 
9, provides an image in analog and/or digital format with 
a resolution of 32×32 pixels. Function block of the 
sensor is sketched as Figure 10. The FPGA chip is 
planned and possessed the capabilities to generate 
sampling frequencies, perform image processing, and 
communicate with the CMOS vision and personal 
computer, as shown in Figure 11. Note that the image 
processing algorithms are implemented using a Nios 
CPU, which is design by using the SOPC design tools 
Quartus II by Altera [12]. Function blocks of the digital 
logic circuits shown in Figure 12 are designed in the 
FPGA to generate sampling frequencies for image 
acquisition. 
 
 
4.  Application 
 
As an example of application, the CMOS vision module 
is utilized to detect the center of a compact disk in a 
CD/DVD duplicator. First, the acquired image is divided 
into 16 sub-image blocks, as shown in Figure 13(a), and 
the blocks with high SD values are filtered out because 
of involution of noise. Second, the sub-image blocks 
with high BL values are selected to form a full image. 
Second, the selected image is recovered from distortion. 
Afterward the processes of resize and edge-detected are 
applied on the image. Finally, the contour image of the 
CD is determined by image segmentation, as shown in 
Figure 13(b). The center of the CD can be found by 
further usage of a weighted method. Figure 14 depicts 
the whole image processing procedure. 
 
 
5.  Conclusion 
 
A machine vision system with hardware capabilities of 
image processing is developed using a low-cost CMOS 
vision in the paper and applied in an automatic 
inspection process to detect the position of a compact 
disk for CD/DVD duplicators. Several image process 
algorithms are designed for the developed vision system. 
All of these mathematical algorithms are implemented in 
a FPGA chip using the SOPC design tools. 
 
Due to the advantages of low price and small dimension, 
the developed vision system with CMOS module has the 
potential usage on many automation products for the 
purposes of inspection or servoing control. However, 
more research efforts must be done on hardware 
implementation of image processing and increase of 
vision resolution.
