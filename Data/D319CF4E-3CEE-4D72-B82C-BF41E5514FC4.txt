Abstract: In this research, the RF magnetron sputtering was employed to grow 3D nano-structured ITO thin films using the 
barrier-layer side of an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) as the template. The template was prepared by immersing the 
barrier-layer side of an AAO film into a 30 wt% phosphoric acid solution to modify the surface of the barrier layer such that 
a contrasting surface was obtained. The resistivity and crystallinity of the deposited ITO thin film were characterized by I-V 
curves and X-ray diffraction. The I-V curve measurements illustrated that the after annealed resistivities of the ITO film 
was 8.25×10-3 Ω-cm. The XRD analysis demonstrated that the annealed ITO film has strong indication of the characteristic 
(222) and (400) peaks to emphasize the crystallinity. A nano-hemispheric TiO2/ITO array electrode for dye-sensitized solar 
cells (DSSC) was further fabricated by electrophoretically depositing TiO2 nanoparticles on the nano-hemispheric ITO 
array.  
 
INTRODUCTION* 
Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a material that holds 
both characteristic of optical transparency (~85%) 
and electrical conductivity (~200μΩ-cm) [1]. It is 
mainly used to make transparent conductive thin film 
for liquid crystal displays [2], flat panel displays, 
organic light-emitting diodes, sensors [3,4], and 
photovoltaics [5]. Recently, it has been found that 
ITO also possesses high sensitivity in sensing 
moisture content and trace gases such as NOx (NO 
and NO2) [6,7] and CO [8,9]. Moreover, ITO film 
can be used to detect H2 [9], O3 [10], CH3OH [11], 
and CCl4 [12]. For the above-mentioned applications, 
thin film has been the basic framework. To enhance 
the sensing sensitivity in gas sensing, nano-structured 
thin film can take the advantage of having larger 
reaction surfaces then that of a bulk or plane thin film 
material, hence raising the volumetric adsorbability 
of the gases. 
In general, thin film of ITO is most commonly 
deposited on surfaces by chemical vapor deposition 
[13], electrostatic spray assisted vapour deposition 
[14], thermal evaporation [15], sol-gel process [16], 
laser ablation [17], DC and RF magnetron sputtering 
[18]. Recently, Chen et al. [19] and Wan et al. [20] 
used the self-catalytic vapor-liquid-solid growth 
method to synthesize ITO nanowires and whiskers, 
respectively. Yu et al. synthesized ITO nanowires by 
the co-precipitation-annealing [21]. Takaki et al. 
fabricated ITO whiskers by sputtering [22]. Among 
the existing fabrication methods, the magnetron 
sputtering is the most widely used method due to it 
can consecutively produce high quality film, hence is 
suitable for large area fabrication. Moreover, it can 
be operated at relatively lower temperature. The DC 
magnetron sputtering has found diverse applications 
in the mass production line. High throughput and low 
resistivity are the main considerations [23]. For the 
RF magnetron sputtering, the applied RF voltage can 
generate high density plasma, resulting in lower

discharging voltage; therefore, can fabricate ITO thin 
films with high uniformity and low resistivity. 
In this research, a novel 3D nano-structured ITO 
thin film was fabricated by using RF magnetron 
sputtering with a pre-processed AAO template. The 
template was prepared by immersing the barrier-layer 
side of an AAO film into a 30 wt% phosphoric acid 
solution to modify the surface of the barrier layer 
such that a honeycomb surface was obtained. A 3D 
nano-structured ITO film then was deposited on the 
surface of the barrier-layer side using RF magnetron 
sputtering. The crystallinity and conductivity of the 
3D ITO films were further enhanced by annealing. 
The 3D ITO films were characterized by scanning 
electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The 
presented 3D nano-structured ITO films can be 
further used as more effective electrode materials for 
high sensitivity gas sensors and biosensors.  
 
3D NANO-STRUCTURED ITO FILMS 
FABRICATION 
Sequential fabrication processes of the 3D 
nano-structured ITO film are: preparation of the 
AAO film, modification of the barrier-layer surface, 
deposition of the ITO thin film, and annealing. Since 
the sputter-coated ITO film is shaped by the structure 
of the barrier-layer surface, the procedures involving 
in the modification of the barrier-layer surface are the 
crucial issue in this research. 
(i) AAO film preparation 
The AAO films were prepared by using the well 
known anodizing process. Aluminum foils 
(99.9995%, 175 μm thick) were cleansed using 
ethanol and acetone in sequence, followed by 
annealing at 400°C for 3 hours in a vacuum. 
Electropolishing was then applied by using a sulfuric 
acid (96 wt %) and phosphoric acid (85 wt %) 
mixing solution as the electrolyte under a constant 
voltage of 20 V at 40 °C for 14 min to further polish 
the surfaces of the foil. AAO films with nanopore 
diameter around 120 nm and thickness of 20 μm 
were obtained by anodizing aluminum foils in a 0.3 
M phosphoric acid solution under 140 V of applied 
voltage at 0°C for 10 hours. The remaining 
  4
 
(iv) Annealing 
Usually, a RF magnetron sputtered ITO film 
has higher resistance and poorer crystalline structure. 
To further modify the surface structures of the 3D 
nanostructure ITO film and reduce the resistance, 
additional annealing process was successively put on 
to the sample [23]. The annealing procedures 
includes: heating the sample up to 300 °C at a rate of 
9 °C/min, staying at 300 °C for 10 minutes, then 
cooling down in air to room temperature. 
Fig. 4 depicts the FESEM images of the 
annealed 3D nanostructure ITO films shown in Fig. 
(3). The respective appearances of the ITO films 
shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 reveal no distinct 
difference. It is presumed that the reallocations of the 
ITO molecules during annealing were still confined 
on the surface of the AAO template the same as the 
originally deposited molecules. 
 
CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ITO FILMS 
I-V Curve Measurement 
The I-V curves of the ITO films were measured 
using a Keithley 2400 Digital Source Meter. Fig. 5 
depicts the I-V curves of the as deposited and 
annealed ITO films. The resistivities of the as 
deposited (Fig. 3a) and the annealed ITO (Fig. 4a) 
films deposited on a rough barrier-layer surfaces 
respectively were calculated to be 1.22×10-2 Ω-cm 
and 8.25×10-3 Ω-cm. The corresponding resistivities 
of the ITO films using reticular templates are 
3.68×10-2 Ω-cm and 1.74×10-2 Ω-cm, respectively. It 
can be found that the resistivities were apparently 
reduced due to annealing. 
It is also found that the resistivity of the ITO 
film deposited on a barrier-layer surface template is 
less than that of the ITO film deposited on a reticular 
template. The conjectural cause is that the reticular 
ITO film has less effectual passage than the ITO film 
deposited on the barrier-layer surface for the 
conveyances of electrons.

Crystallinity Measurement 
An X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens D5000) 
was used to investigate the crystal structure of the 
films. Fig. 6 illustrates the XRD spectra of the 3D 
ITO films. Since the thickness of the deposited ITO 
films were around 90 nm, majority of the irradiating 
X-ray penetrated it to the AAO surface, resulting in 
weaker peak signals. However, the enhancement in 
crystallinity of the annealed film was indicated by the 
XRD analysis. The annealed ITO films have strong 
indication of the characteristic (222) and (400) peaks 
to emphasize the crystallinity.

films. Fig. 6 illustrates the XRD spectra of the 3D 
ITO films. Since the thickness of the deposited ITO

weaker peak signals. However, the enhancement in

by I-V curves and X-ray diffraction. It was found that 
the after annealed  
resistivities of the ITO films deposited on the rough 
barrier-layer surface and the reticular template were 
8.25×10-3 Ω-cm and 1.74×10-2 Ω-cm, respectively. 
The XRD analysis demonstrated that the annealed 
ITO film has strong indication of the characteristic 
(222) and (400) peaks to emphasize the crystallinity. 
Although the resistivity of the 3D nano-structured 
ITO thin film is relatively larger than that of the 
conventional ITO thin film, the reaction efficiency 
can be tremendously increased due to its much larger 
surface area. The presented 3D nano-structured ITO 
film can be further used as a more effective electrode 
material in high sensitivity gas sensors and 
biosensors applications.

bi-directional porous pattern growing from both the 
top and bottom surfaces. The top porous array that 
grows down from the surface directly contacting with 
the echant are much longer than the bottom one that 
is likely to grow upward from the laminating 
interface. It was intuitively assumed that leakage of 
etchant from the clamped areas into the laminating 
interface induced the upward pores. However, this 
leakage hypothesis requires more severe evidence to 
confirm.

3. Experimental Investigation of the Leakage 
Hypothesis 
 Two approaches, leakage blocking and triplex 
foils laminate, are proposed to effectively investigate 
the leakage hypothesis. 
3.1 Leakage blocking experiment 
 If the etchant can be completely blocked from 
contact with the laminate foils except the anodic 
surface, there should be no upward pores according 
to the leakage hypothesis. The leakage blocking can 
be ensured by inserting an elastic gasket between the 
foils and thoroughly sealing the anodizing fixture. 
 Figure 5 schematically illustrates the gasket 
inserting scheme. The negative photoresist JSR that 
is spin-coated and photolithographic patterned on one 
of the aluminum foils (Figure 6) serves as the gasket. 
The other aluminum foil is electrolytically polished 
to assure the flatness of the contact surface. Since the 
JSR is an elastic polymer, it can tightly adhere with 
the aluminum foils when the fixture is closely 
fastened such that the etchant can be prevented from 
leaking in between the laminate foils.

2.1 Experimental Procedures 
The experimental procedures include 
aluminum foil preparation, electropolishing, 
aluminum foils clamping, anodization, and aluminum 
foils separation. 
 
(1) Aluminum foils preparation 
Aluminum foils (99.9995%, 175 μm thick) 
were used during the experiments. The aluminum 
was annealed at 400 °C for 3 hours, vibrated by a 
supersonic vibrator for 1 min, then was cleansed with 
ethanol to degrease the surfaces. 
(2) Electrolytic polishing 
 Electropolished aluminum will produce a 
bright finish as well as level surface. The aluminum 
foil is dipped into a bath solution in which the 
aluminum metal is electrically anodic. This bath 
consists of about 96% sulfuric acid, 85% phosphoric 
acid, and DI water with 1:1:1 ratio. The bath runs at 
40  C for 14 min, being agitated by a magnet to 　
ensure a high quality polishing. 
(3) Aluminum foils clamping 
 The polished aluminum foil is vibrated with a 
supersonic vibrator for 1 min, and then is cleansed 
with ethanol to degrease the surfaces. Clamp two 
aluminum foils tightly together with a Teflon 
clamper as schematically illustrated in Figure 3.

(4) Anodization 
Anodization is carried out under conditions of 
constant voltage 60 V in a 0.3 M oxalic acid solution 
at 0 °C for 7 hours and being stirred by a magnet. 
After anodization (Figure 4), the sample is rinsed 
again with DI water, and then is dried with ethanol. 
A milky thin film can be found covering the top 
surface of the anodized sample and could be removed 
by DI water.

2.2 Experimental results and discussions 
 Three different experiments were conducted to 
investigate the dependency of the porous pattern on 
the surface structure of the laminate foils. 
(1) Unpolished aluminum laminate 
Tightly clamp two unpolished aluminum foils 
together as shown in Figure 6, followed by 
anodization. SEM images of the resulting AAO are 
shown in Figure 7. It can be found that the porous 
pattern on the top view of the upper aluminum oxide 
foil (Figure 7a) is similar to the pattern depicted in 
Figure 1(a), where the pattern resulted from an 
unpolished aluminum metal processed by 
conventional approach. The bottom view of the upper 
aluminum oxide foil is shown in Figure 7(b). The 
porous pattern spreads along a certain direction and 
is different from that of the unpolished aluminum 
sheet under conventional processing. It implies that 
the porous pattern on the bottom surface of the upper 
foil is determined by the structure of the bottom 
surface. The cross-sectional image of the aluminum 
oxide is shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that the 
pores grew from both the top and the bottom surfaces. 
Those pores grew from the top surface are much 
longer than those from the bottom surface. Ideally, 
the bottom surface was tightly clamped together with 
the top surface of the lower metal sheet; therefore, 
there should not be pore at the bottom surface of the 
upper metal sheet. We deduce that leakage between 
the foils may a feasible cause to have the upward 
pores grow in the notches of the unpolished surface.

Figure 16 is the bottom view of the upper foil

presumed to be caused by the thermal expansion 
variations between aluminum and PMMA during 
soft baking. Figure 17 shows the porous patterns 
after the PMMA having removed by acetone. This 
experiment further confirms that the proposed foils 
laminate approach is able to define the porous 
patterns of the AAO.

3. Conclusions 
In this research, a series of anodic aluminum 
oxide fabrication experiments based on the aluminum 
foils laminate approach were carried out. During the 
experiments, we found that the pores of the AAO 
grew only on the upper foil, bi-directionally from 
both the top and the bottom surfaces. Experimental 
results further indicate that the upward porous pattern 
of the upper foil is determined by the surface 
structure of the bottom surface of the upper foil. The 
porous pattern of AAO can be controlled by a 
pre-made pattern on the bottom surface. In addition, 
since porous patterns formed by the anodization from 
both sides of the upper foil, no aluminum removing 
process is required in this novel laminate approach. 
The developed work in this study can be further 
applied to the fabrication of nanofunction devices.

then carried out using a 1:4 perchloric acid and 
anhydrous ethanol solution as the electrolyte, under a 
constant voltage of 20 V at 40 °C for 2 minutes to 
further polish the surfaces of the foil. AAO films 
with a nanopore diameter of around 100 nm and a 
thickness of 50 μm were obtained by anodizing 
aluminum foils in a 0.3 M oxalic acid solution under 
90 V of applied voltage at 0°C for 2 hours. The 
remaining aluminum beneath the barrier layer was 
dissolved in an aqueous CuCl2⋅HCl solution that was 
prepared by dissolving 13.45 g of CuCl2 powder in 
100 ml of 35 wt% hydrochloric acid solution. The 
sample was then immersed in a 30 wt% phosphoric 
acid solution at room temperature for 80 min to 
process the barrier layer by purging and pore 
widening. AAO templates with holes all the way 
through were obtained. 
(ii) Working electrode coating 
A 20 nm thick chromium connecting layer and then 
a 40 nm thick gold working electrode for 
electroforming were coated onto one side of the AAO 
template using thermal evaporation. 
(iii) Electrodeposition 
Electrodeposition was carried out using a 
micro-electro forming system (EGG Instruments 
corporation/Model 263A) with a bulk nickel anode 
and the chromium and gold coated AAO template as 
the cathode, under a constant current of 0.02 A at 
ambient temperature. Ni nanorods were 
electrodeposited from an aqueous solution of nickel 
sulfamate (Ni(NH2SO3⋅4H2O), and chloride 
(NiCl4⋅7H2O) in a boric acid solution (H3BO3).  
(iv) Annealing 
    The crystalline structure and mechanical 
properties of metal nanorods electrodeposited in the 
nanochannels of an AAO template are not so good 
but can be improved by the applications of an 
additional annealing process to the sample. This 
procedure includes: heating the sample to 507 °C at a 
rate of 10 °C/min, keeping the sample at this 
temperature for 1 hour, then cooling the sample in air 
to room temperature.[21] Since the metal nanorods 
were encompassed and insulated by the surrounding 
alumina, no oxidation of metal occurred during 
annealing. 
(v) Alumina etching 
The sample was immersed in a 30 wt% phosphoric 
acid solution at room temperature to etch out the 
alumina, starting from the borders between the 
hexagonal cells. High aspect ratio alumina-metal 
coaxial nanorods with alumina shells of different 
thicknesses were obtained.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Results 
Figure 2 shows scanning electron microscope 
(SEM) images of the AAO template used in this 
study. Due to the competitive mechanism of pore 
nucleation and growth, the upper-most layer of the 
AAO film is made up of distorted pores with 
narrower pore-size than those inside the film [22, 23]. 
Therefore, the nanopore diameter looking from the 
top view is less then 100 nm while it is about 100 nm 
from the cross-sectional view.

Figure 3 shows the cross-sectional backscattered 
electron image (BEI) of a Ni deposited sample. Due 
to the relative difficulty of focusing the energy 
dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), we utilized the 
backscattered electron image (BEI) function of the 
JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission scanning electron 
microscope (FESEM) to determine whether nickel 
had been deposited in the nanochannels of the AAO 
template. The BEI works on the principle of electron 
backscattering. Incident electrons collide with the 
sample and the kinetic energy of the reflected 
electrons is almost identical to or slightly less than 
  18
nickel core is enclosed by a shell of another material. 
In this study, alumina is presumed to be the shell that 
encloses the nickel core. Figure 8 is the selected area 
electron diffraction (SEAD) image for the sample in 
Figure 7. It further indicates the alumina/nickel 
coaxial structure. 
Figure 9 shows the SEM image of an 
alumina-nickel coaxial nanorod array after annealing 
and phosphoric acid etching for 60 min. 
An X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens D5000) was 
used to investigate the crystal structure of the original 
and annealed samples. Figure 10 illustrates the XRD 
spectra of the samples. The crystallinity of nickel 
was indicated by the characteristic peaks at (111), 
(200), and (220) of the XRD spectra [24]. The 
enhancement in crystallinity of the annealed sample 
was indicated by the relatively stronger peaks of the 
XRD spectra.

Discussions 
In general, the area of an AAO membrane that is 
close to the pore soaks in more electrolyte ions than 
the area that is far from the pore. The electrolyte ions 
contaminated area can be etched more easily. 
However, the coaxial nanorod array took shape due 
to the unequal etching rates between the etching from 
the borders of the cell towards the pore and that from 
top to bottom. It is merited to further investigate the 
causes. 
The regular cellular morphology of a steady-state 
AAO film can be depicted in Figure 11 [25]. The cell 
consists of acid anion-contaminated region adjacent 
to the pore and relatively pure alumina removed from 
it. The ratio of the thickness of relatively pure 
alumina region to acid anion-contaminated material 
in terms of the electrolyte acids increases in the order 
of phosphoric acid (0.5) > oxalic acid (0.1) > sulfuric 
acid (0.01). 
For a nickel deposited film, the etching rate at the 
borders (relatively pure alumina region) is faster than 
at the area around the nickel core (acid 
anion-contaminated region). i.e. The borders are 
etched down faster than the rest of the alumina. The 
difference in etching rate causes the formation of 
fosses at the borders. The etchant then etches the 
borders down and etches the acid anion-contaminated 
material toward the pore simultaneously, resulting in 
the alumina/nickel coaxial structure. The formation 
process is revealed in Figure 12.

annealing process. The annealing procedures included: 
heating the sample to 400 °C at a rate of 20 °C/sec 
and staying for 40 min; then cooling the sample in air 
to room temperature. 
(5) Electrochemical deposition of Au nanoparticles 
A picoammeter (Sversa Stat II, Princeton Applied 
Research) was used to conduct the electrophoretic 
deposition. The 3D Au sample was placed at the 
working electrode (WE) with the Au thin film being 
the electrode. The counter electrode was a Pt film 
while the reference electrode (RE) was AgCl. The 
deposition processes included: 
(i) Electrolyte preparation： 
The electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 1 mL 
of 0.02 M HAuCl4 solution in 40 mL of deionized 
water. 
(ii) Reducing potential measurement: 
The reducing potential of the electrolyte HAuCl4 
solution measured using an electrochemical analyzer 
(Model 627C, CH Instruments) was detected to be 
-0.8V. 
(iii) Electrochemical deposition: 
A DC -0.8 V electric potential was applied for 
300 sec to conduct the process of electrochemical 
deposition. 
Figure 2 shows an SEM image of the modified 
barrier-layer surface after being etched by a 30 wt% 
phosphoric acid for 40 minutes. Due to the stress 
concentration effect during anodization, the 
phosphoric acid etched out more alumina at the 
borders between the cells than from the cell surfaces, 
resulting in an orderly hemispheric barrier-layer 
surface.  
The deposition results of an Au thin film on the 
modified barrier-layer surface are illustrated in Figure 
3. The Au thin film took its form from the shape of 
the barrier-layer surface. 
Figure 4 shows the results of the electrochemical 
deposition of gold nanoparticles. The gold 
nanoparticles have an average diameter of about 10 
nm and are uniformly and compactly deposited on the 
hemispheric electrode array. The working principle of 
the proposed electrochemical deposition is depicted 
in Figure 5. The uniformly propagated electric flux 
( E
v
) perpendicular to the hemispheric Au thin film 
electrode has pulled the Au nanoparticles in the 
electrolyte so that they can be densely deposited onto 
the surface of the Au thin film electrode without the 
necessity of any reducing agent and stabilizer. 
Since the morphology of the deposited gold 
nanoparticles is a function of the electric flux density, 
which is determined by the applied potential, it is 
worthwhile to investigate the dependencies of the 
deposition morphology on the applied potential. 
Figure 6 shows the deposition morphologies for 
different applied potentials. The deposition duration 
was 300 sec. Figure 7 illustrates the dependency of 
the particle size and density on the applied potentials. 
It is shown that a higher applied potential resulted in 
gold nanoparticles with a larger diameter. It is also 
observed that number of gold nanoparticles deposited 
on each hemispheric electrode reached a peak value 
when the potential was -0.7 V, and afterwards 
decreased due to the aggregation of nanoparticles. 
The morphology experiments demonstrate that the 
deposition density and particle size could be 
controlled by the applied potential. 
In summary, we present a novel reducing agent 
and stabilizer-free method based on the 
electrochemical deposition method for the synthesis 
of uniformly distributed gold nanoparticles. During 
the first stage, the barrier layer of an AAO film was 
etched by a 30 wt% phosphoric acid solution, 
revealing a sharper nano-hemisphere array; the 
modified barrier layer surface was then used as the 
template for the sputtering of a gold thin film 
electrode; gold nanoparticles were then uniformly 
deposited on the gold thin film by electrochemical 
deposition. The distribution density and size of the 
nanoparticles could be well controlled by the applied 
potential during the electrochemical deposition 
process. It is hoped in future work, that we can 
implement the uniformly deposited gold nanoparticle 
array into a high sensitive nano biosensor. The 
sensitivity of the biosensor is expected to be 
markedly enhanced due to the following factors: (1) 
the 3D nanostructure of the AAO film increases the 
binding surface of the gold nanoparticles; (2) the 
exceptionally uniform distribution of the gold 
nanoparticles increases the number of receptors or 
antibodies; (3) the larger area of the sensing element 
further enlarges the sensing area.

with a nanopore diameter of around 100 nm and a 
thickness of 50 μm were obtained by anodizing 
aluminum foils in a 0.3 M oxalic acid solution under 
90 V of applied voltage at 0°C for 2 hours. The 
remaining aluminum beneath the barrier layer was 
dissolved in an aqueous CuCl2⋅HCl solution that was 
prepared by dissolving 13.45 g of CuCl2 powder in 
100 ml of 35 wt% hydrochloric acid solution, 
revealing the honeycomb barrier-layer surface with 
average convex diameter of 80 nm.  
(ii) The barrier-layer surface thickness reducing 
Immerse the barrier-layer surface into a 30 wt% 
phosphoric acid for 40 minutes to reduce its 
thickness. The purpose of this thickness reducing 
operation is to ensure that the patterned area defined 
by the succeeding photolithography can be easily 
etched through before the photoresist is etched out. 
(iii) The barrier-layer surface photolithography 
Spin coat the barrier-layer surface by a layer of 1 
μm thick AZ 1518 positive photoresist. Parameters 
for the spinning coating are: spinning speed of the 
first stage= 500 rpm, spinning time for the first 
stage= 10 sec, spinning speed of the 2nd stage= 1500 
rpm, spinning time for the 2nd stage= 20 sec.; soft 
bake at 100 °C for 120 sec.; transfer the desired 
pattern by UV exposing for 25 sec and developing 
using AZ-300K developer for 30 sec.; hard bake at 
120 °C for 180 sec. 
(iv) The patterned barrier-layer surface removing 
Immerse the barrier-layer surface into a 30 wt% 
phosphoric acid for 5 minutes to remove the 
patterned area of the barrier-layer surface. 
(v) Working electrode coating 
A 20 nm thick chromium connecting layer and then 
a 40 nm thick gold working electrode for 
electroforming were coated onto the barrier-layer 
side of the AAO template using thermal evaporation. 
(vi) Electrodeposition 
Electrodeposition was carried out using a 
micro-electro forming system (EGG Instruments 
corporation/Model 263A) with a bulk nickel anode 
and the chromium and gold coated AAO template as 
the cathode, under a constant current of 0.02 A at 
ambient temperature. Ni nanorods were 
electrodeposited from an aqueous solution of nickel 
sulfamate (Ni(NH2SO3⋅4H2O), and chloride 
(NiCl4⋅7H2O) in a boric acid solution (H3BO3).  
(vii) Annealing 
    The crystalline structure and mechanical 
properties of metal nanorods electrodeposited in the 
nanochannels of an AAO template are not so good 
but can be improved by the applications of an 
additional annealing process to the sample. This 
procedure includes: heating the sample to 507 °C at a 
rate of 10 °C/min, keeping the sample at this 
temperature for 1 hour, then cooling the sample in air 
to room temperature [29]. Since the metal nanorods 
were encompassed and insulated by the surrounding 
alumina, no oxidation of metal occurred during 
annealing. 
(viii) Alumina etching 
The sample was again immersed in a 30 wt% 
phosphoric acid solution at room temperature to etch 
out the alumina. At the nickel deposited area, the 
etching of alumina starts from the borders between 
the hexagonal cells. High aspect ratio alumina-metal 
coaxial nanorods with alumina shells were obtained.

increases in the order of phosphoric acid (0.5) <

nickel deposited area, the etching rate at the borders 
(relatively pure alumina region) is faster than at the

4. Conclusion 
In this article, we presented a novel template 
assisted method for the fabrication of patterned 
alumina-metal coaxial nanorod arrays. The sequential 
fabrication processes include: AAO template 
preparation, the barrier-layer surface thickness 
reducing, the barrier-layer surface photolithography, 
the patterned barrier-layer surface removing, working 
electrode coating, electrodeposition, annealing, and 
alumina etching. Using a photomask that contained 
an array of circles with diameter and pitch being 6 
μm and 10 μm, respectively, an orderly arranged 
array of bundles of hundreds of alumina-nickel 
coaxial nanorods was fabricated. The diameter of the 
bundle and the pitch between bundles can be well 
defined by the photomask. In our future work, a 
photomask that contains an array of circles with 
diameter and pitch being around 200 nm will be 
implemented to fabricate nanoprobes and 
nanoactuators for the detection of biological 
properties of a single cell.

Abstract 
A simple micromolding method for fabricating PLGA microstructures made up of 
microchannels with a circular cross-section is presented. The thermal reflow technique is 
adopted to fabricate the semi-cylindrical photoresist master. The PLGA solution is prepared 
by dissolving PLGA polymer in acetone and then casting the solution onto the 
semi-cylindrical photoresist master to produce PLGA microstructures. Two PLGA 
membranes are bonded together to form microstructures consisting of circular microchannels. 
A microvessel scaffold suitable for tissue engineering was fabricated using the proposed 
method, and bovine endothelial cells were cultured into the scaffold by semi-dynamic 
seeding. The cell stain Calcein-AM was used to overcome the problem of the PLGA 
scaffolds becoming opaque, which in the past has made it difficult to effectively monitor the 
progress of cell seeding. 
Keywords: PLGA, Circular microchannel, Thermal reflow, Calcein-AM labeling 
 
1. Introduction 
In recent years the fusion of biotechnology and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), 
known as BioMEMS, has enabled biotechnologists to quickly examine large numbers of 
biological analytes for a range of purposes, from disease diagnosis to detection of 
bioterrorism agents. A large variety of related products, such as biochip and lab-on-a-chip 
devices [1-3], biosensors [4-5], electrotactile displays [6], scaffolds for cell culture [7-8], and 
biomaterials, are either in development or being commercialized. Numerous advances 
continue to be made, enabling the development of new platforms for new applications. 
The key technological hurdle in the production of BioMEMS devices is the fabrication 
of microchannels and microstructure. Several techniques have been developed to fabricate 
microchannels and microstructure, including bulk micromachining [9-10], LIGA processing 
[11], hot embossing [12], excimer laser cutting [13], injection molding [14-15], and soft 
lithography [16-17]. The powerful patterning capabilities of soft lithography, together with its 
experimental simplicity, make it a useful approach for a wide range of applications. The soft 
lithography process includes fabrication of the elastomeric mold and the use of that mold to 
create features with geometries defined by the mold’s relief structure.  
In the search for a good method for fabricating microfluidic devices for use in biology 
and biomedicine, soft lithography using polymers such as PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) has 
been studied and successfully used to make biomedical devices [18]. However, if the 
microfluidic devices produced in this way are to be implanted into a live body, it would be 
desirable to use biodegradable and biocompatible polymers such as PLA (poly(L-Lactic)), 
PGA (poly(glycolide)), and PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) . Although the

2.2 Microstructure fabrication 
(1) PLGA solution 
The PLGA solution was prepared by dissolving 85/15 POLY, IV：1.6-1.99 (dl/g), 
Mw:350000-500000 (Da) (Bio Invigor Corp., Taiwan) in acetone in a 1:4 w/w ratio, by 
stirring the mixture with a magneto agitator at 60°C for 60 min. The PLGA solution was then 
shaken by an ultrasonic shaker for 15 min to remove bubbles created during mixing. In 
general, PLGA is soluble in a wide range of common organic solvents, including chlorinated 
solvents, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethyl acetate, and dioxane. However, because the JSR 
THB-120N master is soluble in certain solvents, the solvent used to prepare the PLGA 
solution must be carefully selected. We have found that acetone has the least corrosive effect 
on JSR THB-120.  
(2) Micromolding the bottom plate 
The procedures used to fabricate the PLGA bottom plate are illustrated in Figure 3. The 
PLGA solution was cast onto the semi-cylindrical photoresist master by placing the master in 
a vessel, pouring the solution over the master, and then leaving the system at room 
temperature for 90 min to evaporate the acetone. The thickness of the resulting PLGA 
membrane was much greater than the 60 μm designed depth of the microchannels. A more 
precise 1-mm-thick membrane can be obtained by spinning coating the PLGA solution onto 
the semi-cylindrical photoresist master using a spinning velocity of 350 rpm for 10 sec.  
We found that the PLGA membrane could be easily separated from the glass substrate in 
cold water. Specifically, the vessel holding the PLGA membrane and the glass substrate was 
immersed in cold water for 2-3 minutes and then the PLGA was peeled off.

(3) Micromolding the top plate 
The micromolding procedures used for the PLGA top plate, shown schematically in 
Figure 4, are similar to those for the bottom plate, except that connecting holes are created in 
circular microchannels are very similar, flows in rectangular microchannels always have dead 
volumes in the corners. Such dead volumes would likely lead to inefficient circulation of 
nutrients and oxygen during cell seeding. Thus, the fabrication of microvessel scaffolds with 
circular microchannels is desirable.

engineering 
Figure 7 shows a 3D confocal microscope (NanoFocus AG) of the PLGA bottom plate 
as well as a representative cross-section of a microchannel. The micrograph shows that the 
desired microchannel structure has been patterned on PLGA, and the cross-section confirms 
that the microchannel depth is close to 60 μm, the design value.

Figure 8 shows an SEM image of a cross-section of the PLGA microvessel scaffold with 
circular microchannels. A round microchannel is observed, indicating accurate alignment of 
the top and bottom plates. To ensure that the seals of the PLGA scaffold are robust and 
leakproof, a syringe pump was used to continuously circulate the cultivation medium inside 
the scaffold for several minutes.

3.3 Seeding Monitoring 
As the cell seeding proceeded, the PLGA scaffold progressively turned opaque due to 
absorption of the cultivation medium into the PLGA and hydrolysis of the PLGA. Commonly, 
a PLGA scaffold becomes completely milky and opaque within 24 hours, making it difficult 
to monitor the progress of cell seeding by an optical microscopy (OM). Figures 11 and 12 
show OM images taken shortly after seeding commenced and 24 hours later, respectively. 
    
Figure 11. OM images taken during the initial stage of seeding 
 
       
Figure 12. OM images taken after 24 hours of seeding. 
To overcome the inability to effectively monitor the cell seeding progress after the 
scaffold becomes opaque, we adopted the cell stain Calcein-AM. Calcein-AM was chosen as 
the most suitable fluorescent probe for staining viable cells because it has low cytotoxicity, 
readily passes through the cell membrane of viable cells because of its hydrophobicity, and 
does not inhibit any cellular functions such as proliferation or chemotaxis of lymphocytes. 
The labeling procedure was as follows: 
(i) Prepare 1 mM Calcein-AM solution with DMSO and dilute to 1-50 µM Calcein-AM 
solution with PBS.  
(ii) To the well containing the cells in culture medium, add an aliquot of Calcein-AM solution 
with a volume equal to 1/10 of the volume of cell culture medium.  
(iii) Inject the labeled cell suspension into the PLGA scaffold and incubate the cells. 
(iv) Observe the cells using a fluorescence microscope with 490 nm excitation and 515 nm 
emission filters.
