Research Background 
A major concern of transportation 
agencies is the deterioration of concrete 
bridge elements (Cady and Weyer, 1992).  
The leading cause of concrete deterioration 
is chloride-induced corrosion of the black 
steel reinforcing bars.  The effects of 
corrosion are delamination, spalling, and loss 
of reinforcing bar area.  To deal with this 
problem, bridge maintenance engineers need 
tools to analyze alternative maintenance 
strategies and to aid decision-making at the 
project- and network-levels.   
In 1993, Purvis and Babaei described a 
procedure for making preservation 
maintenance decisions for concrete bridges 
subject to chloride-induced corrosion (Purvis 
and Babaei, 1993).  The procedure is a 
project-level tool based upon a mechanistic 
model of concrete deterioration due to 
corrosion.  A similar approach for 
predicting the service life of 
corrosion-induced concrete was developed 
by Cady and Weyer (1992).  In 1996, 
Babaei et al. published a handbook that 
describes and extends the earlier work of 
Purvis and Babaei (Babaei et al., 1996).  
Huang et al. (2004) incorporated the 
mechanistic deterioration model proposed by 
Babaei et al. (1996) and probabilistic 
life-cycle cost analysis to optimize the 
maintenance and rehabilitation strategies for 
concrete bridge decks in Wisconsin.  In this 
research, it was found that the maximum 
tolerable condition strongly influences the 
selection of the optimal maintenance 
scenario. 
As a concrete element ages and 
deteriorates, its condition reaches a point that 
the element must be repaired or replaced.  
This point defines the maximum tolerable 
condition, which is also the agency’s 
minimum acceptable condition.  When a 
maintenance activity is performed when the 
element reaches the maximum tolerable 
condition, it is called an on-time 
maintenance.  In the research of Huang et al. 
(2004), it’s also found that estimated service 
life of a maintenance and rehabilitation 
activity (treatment) is strongly influenced by 
the treatment timing.  Early maintenance 
increases the estimated service life of the 
treatment and that late maintenance reduces 
the estimated service life of the treatment.  
These findings point out that the maximum 
tolerable condition influences not only the 
timing of maintenance and rehabilitation 
activities, but also the service lives of 
maintenance and rehabilitation activities.  It 
was suggested that the maximum tolerable 
condition should be build for different states 
to support the decision-making processes.  
 
 
Research Objectives and Scopes 
This research focuses on deterioration 
and rehabilitation of concrete bridge 
elements deteriorated due to 
chloride-induced corrosion of the steel 
reinforcement in Taiwan.  The main 
purpose of this research is to utilize the 
historical bridge element data collected from 
the bridge management system to establish 
the maximum tolerable condition, i.e. the 
agency’s minimum acceptable condition, of 
concrete bridge elements.  This condition 
index is expecting to assist the agency’s 
engineers’ decision making with when to 
perform the maintenance and rehabilitation 
activities from the cost-effective point of 
view. 
 
Research Methodology 
In this research, an existing mechanistic 
delaminations combined.  Based on the 
bridge maintenance engineers, it was 
assumed that the ratio of spalled to 
delaminated areas is 1 to 3; that is 25 percent 
of the distressed area was spalled and 75 
percent was delaminated.  It must be noted 
that an E index of 3 corresponds to a 
percentage of combined spalled and 
delaminated area between 30 and 60.  
Using the worst condition of 60 percent of 
spalled and delaminated areas combined, it is 
assumed that 15 percent of the element was 
spalled and 45 percent of the element was 
delaminated. 
Based on the data collected, the 
performance curves of five concrete decks 
are shown in Figure 2.  These five decks 
were built at 5 different years during 1970 to 
1980.  From the most currently inspection 
records obtained in 2003 to 2005, their E 
indexes were found ranging from 1 to 3.

Figure 2 Performance curves of sample cases 
 
From Figure 2, it was found the 
performance curves of decks A and E may 
present the best and worst performance of 
the decks built in year 1970 to 1980.  It was 
also found that from the collected decks, 
there is no decks with the value of E index of 
4, presenting that once the deck reach the E 
index of 3, the maintenance will be 
conducted to prevent the deck deteriorate to 
worse condition.  It follows that 
maintenance of bridge decks in Taiwan is 
performed when they reach the E index of 3 
which is equivalent to a maximum tolerable 
condition index Smax of 32.  It is noted that 
this value for Smax is higher than the 
maximum tolerable condition ranging 
between 16 and 23 in Wisconsin, USA 
(Huang et al., 2004). 
 
 
Service Life of Maintenance 
The selection of the optimal 
maintenance activity depends, among other 
factors, on the estimated service life and the 
timing to perform the treatment.  The 
equation suggested by Babaei et al. (1996) to 
estimate the service life of a maintenance 
activity is shown as follows: 
 
for K ≠ 0 
ESL = {[ (t* - t0)2 + K (tm - t0)2 ]0.5  
– (t* - t0) } / K   (Eq. 3) 
for K = 0 
ESL = 0.5 (tm - t0)2 / (t* - t0) (Eq. 4) 
 
where 
K: the ratio of the slope of corrosion rate 
increase after treatment to the slope of 
corrosion rate increase before treatment 
ESL: estimated service life 
t*:age of concrete at time of treatment 
tm: age of concrete at maximum tolerable 
index 
t0: age of concrete at time to first sign of 
corrosion. 
 
The effectiveness of the treatment is 
quantified by the use of a parameter K in the 
mechanistic model.  If the rate of corrosion 
continues to increase at the same rate 
(constant acceleration) after maintenance, 
then K = 1.  If the rate of corrosion 
continues to increase after maintenance, but 
at a slower rate (less acceleration), K is 
between 0 and 1.  Most commonly used 
treatments nowadays such as patching, 
asphalt and concrete overlays fall into this 
category.  If the rate of corrosion decreases 
after the treatment, then K < 0, and if the rate 
of corrosion drops to zero after the treatment, 
K is -∞.
