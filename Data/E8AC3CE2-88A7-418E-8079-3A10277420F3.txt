1. Introduction  
 
Advanced CMOS process and three-dimensional structure technologies have been applied to IC design 
and production in recent several years so that transistor density of microprocessors is rapidly increasing. 
High transistor density which also increases the power density leads to high operating temperatures and 
gradients of temperature in time and different locations of a microprocessor. Previous studies [2; 15; 17; 
19; 21; 23] indicated that the high operating temperature and space and time gradients of temperature on 
microprocessors increase the leakage power, introduce clock skew and system failure, and reduce 
performance and reliability of microprocessors.  
A number of dynamic thermal management (DTM) technologies such as clock gating, dynamic voltage 
and frequency scaling (DVFS) [10], task migration [12; 25] and job scheduling [9; 16] have been 
proposed to adjust system operations in run-time to control the thermal behavior [21]. These 
technologies all require fast and accurate thermal information as inputs for determining the schedule 
strategies [28]. Imprecise and late temperature information may delay the activation of DTM and 
influence the system operations [26]. 
The thermal estimation technologies could be divided into two major categories, which are hardware-
based approaches [8; 14; 20; 22; 26; 33] and software-based approaches [18; 28]. For hardware-based 
approaches, thermal information is mainly obtained from on-chip thermal sensors. However, the 
hardware-based approaches could only provide accurate results while there is sufficient number of 
accurate thermal sensors on a chip. Therefore, the hardware-based approaches may suffer from intrinsic 
accuracy problem of thermal sensors, manufacturing cost and die size if more sensors are allocated and 
location constraints of sensors on the chip [22]. On the other hand, thermal information would be 
derived from the thermal models and power variation over time through software-based approaches. For 
example, the power consumption of each component of a chip could be obtained via translation from 
performance counters with power models, such as Wattch [4], or (and) direct measurement. The fine-
grained thermal information could be estimated based on the power consumption of each component of a 
chip. Wei et al. concluded that software-simulated thermal information can achieve very high accuracy 
[31]. Nevertheless, simulation based on full thermal models would take significant execution time and 
memory usage which may not be suitable for DTM. In this project, we propose a reduced thermal model 
to speed up thermal estimation and reduce memory consumption for the simulation process. We compare 
are applied to IC production, a chip contains extremely large number of gates, which results in 
complicated computation while analyzing the thermal model. Hence, several methods are proposed to 
improve the efficiency of chip-level analysis [1; 29; 30; 32]. Another approach is through architecture-
level analysis [3; 6; 13; 24; 27; 28], where the circuits of microprocessor would be divided into 
microarchitecture  blocks with related packaging layers, and each of them would be further transformed 
into dynamic compact model for thermal analyzing. Several modeling and simulation tools are also 
developed in architecture-level. The architecture-level thermal simulator which is widely adopted in 
several domains is Hotspot since its accuracy was validated and its efficiency is better than chip-level 
analysis [31]. However, Hotspot derives fourth order differential equations for the constructed dynamic 
compact model, and adopts fourth order Runge-Kutta method [11], which leads to high overhead in 
computation and memory usage, to solve these differential equations. Hence, the architecture-level with 
full thermal model may not be able to apply to generating thermal information for DTM. In this project, 
we propose a reduced electrical circuit model to estimate the thermal behavior of a microprocessor 
which significantly reduces the computation and memory space with a slight degradation of the accuracy. 
 
3. Model and Formula 
 
Figure 1 is an example of RC model adopted in [28], and Figure 2 shows part of RC model in Figure 1, 
which contains two adjacent functional blocks and the relation between them. In this section, the concept 
of proposed method is explained based on the simplest structure showed in Figure 2. In general system, 
the lateral thermal resistance on chip is far larger than the vertical resistance between layers since the 
thinkess of a chip is considerably thin. Hence, in the process of the proposed method contain two steps, 
where each of them computes the effect of vertical thermal conduction and lateral thermal conduction 
respectively. Finally, two steps are combined via applying the effect of lateral thermal conduction for 
calibration in the computation of the effect of vertical thermal conduction. 
could be further reduced to the simplest low-pass filter as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, the current 
flows through thermal resistances could be computed by

From (1), the current at each timestamp could be computed from the current at preceding timestamp and 
the input current source with a linear equation. Finally, the temperature difference between ambiance 
and each functional block is computed by multiplying the current from (1) with the equivalent resistance 
from each functional block to ambiance. Since the ambient temperature can be obtained from the 
environment setting, which is the same as the process in Hotspot, the isolate temperature of each 
functional block can be computed. The temperature computed from above process has a similar 
waveform with actual temperature but with certain temperature shift comparing with actual temperature. 
In next section, the thermal flow from adjacent blocks is considered to calibrate such shift in temperature.

4. Experimental Setup and Results 
 
4.1  Experimental Setup 
 
In order to obtain power trace for the input of proposed approach, we combine SimpleScalar [5] and 
Wattch to run a set of benchmarks, SPECCPU2k6, where SimpleScalar is set as 2GHz and sampling rate 
is 10000 cycles. The same power trace is also inputted to Hotspot for comparison of accuracy and 
performance. SimpleScalar is a well-known ISA simulator for computer architecture, which could 
generate performance data of workloads regardless of interrupt. Wattch is a power model which could be 
embedded into SimpleScalar, and it could compute power consumptions of each functional block from 
the data of performance counter generated from SimpleScalar.
