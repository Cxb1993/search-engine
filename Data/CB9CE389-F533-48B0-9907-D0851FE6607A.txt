2Abstract
A series of experiments has been conducted using aluminum strips, which manifest a strong
tendency toward roughening in forming processes, to investigate the evolvement of surface roughness
and its resistance to flattening. The strips are stretched to specific bulk strains and are then
compressed by a smooth glass at various pressures. It is found that except for very high bulk strain, the
free surface on the transverse specimen roughens more seriously and irregularly than the longitudinal
one due to the fierce rotations of grains, which make the grains parallel to the straining direction and
eventually mutate the topography into an isotropic one. As the roughened surface is compressed, the
transverse specimen may roughen further in the case of large bulk strain. According to the FEM
analysis using serrated surfaces, the sharper asperity undergoes more serious straining on its peak
and basically such a strain increment is not affected by the degree of flattening. The ability to resist
flattening, defined as the “asperity hardness,”varies with asperity angle as well as the enhanced
shear strength on the asperity tip, rather than the substrate. A new quantitative description of the
asperity hardness is suggested and the new calculated contact area ratios are in good agreement with
the experiments except for very high pressure where additional mechanics such as adiabatic
recrystallization might happen. The concept of the additional hardening on asperity peaks can be
employed to refine the prediction of asperity contact in the analysis of metal forming.

4on sheet metals. Fig. 1 shows the schematic illustration of the experimental apparatus. Details are
reported in [15, 16]. The transparent glass tooling is fitted into a sliding table having a long and narrow
observing slot. During the test, the glass and the workpiece are brought in contact. The table, which is
restrained by two parallel guideways, is either fixed or pulled by a servomotor with assigned velocity.
Since the workpiece is stationary, a CCD camera can be placed above the sliding table and points at a
specific area on the workpiece surface through the narrow slot to catch the continuous evolvement of
the asperity deformation. In this paper, it is thus interesting to delve into the effect of the increasing
asperity slope, aggravated by roughening, on the asperity resistance to flattening by means of the
special function of visualization. Being our first attempt, the aluminum strip was pre-strained by a
typical tensile machine, and was compressed without bulk strain rate. The results from the
experimental observation will be compared with the previous models. Some new concepts will be
introduced and be applied to modify the other contact theories. We hope that this approach and our
initial efforts may lead to refreshing modeling and analysis for future asperity contact research.
2. Experiments
The strip for the test is the rolled aluminum 1050-O and is named longitudinal as it is stretched
along the rolling direction; and is called transverse when the stretching direction is normal to the
rolling direction. The yield strengths of the longitudinal and transverse specimens are equal to 43.85
MPa and 47.22 MPa, respectively; and their stress-strain curves can be represented by the power law
ase = 107.8e 0.221 MPa ande = 116.87e 0.266 MPa, respectively. The strip has roughness Ra= 0.38
m as received.
First, the aluminum specimen (bone-shape with narrowed area 50 mm long, 25 mm wide, and 1
mm thick) is stretched to generate different bulk strainsp up to 0.2513 by the typical tensile machine
with tensile speed 0.05 mm/s. Then the pre-stretched strip is compressed by the SMFT [15, 16] where
the apparent contact area is 3 mm long and 16 mm wide. The chemically harden glass is 10 mm thick
and is able to endure 325 MPa. The glass has Ra and Rq values equal to 0.0230 m and 0.0395 m,
respectively; it therefore can be considered as a smooth surface compared with the aluminum strip.
Before each compression test, the glass tool and the lower die surfaces are cleaned with acetone and no
lubricant is used. The strip is then attached to the glass tool using the glue tapes. The apparent pressure
is adjusted by changing the hydraulic pressure in the cylinder, which lifts the lower die to have a firm
contact with the strip. Three apparent pressures: 35, 57, and 88 MPa are assigned in the present test.
The CCD camera is focused on the imprinted area through the glass and the image is monitored and
recorded synchronously. The image is used to analyze the contact area ratio of the flattened asperities.
The strip is then unloaded and the impressed region is measured by the white-light interferometer to
get its surface topography.
3. Experimental Results
3.1 Change of Surface Topography
As an example, Fig. 2 presents the CCD photographs of the specimen surfaces, which are
pre-stretched to have the strain 0.1018 and is then compressed with apparent pressure 88 MPa. The
6and
f2(A) =1/ [2.571–A–A ln (1–A)] (4)
When asperities with spacing Sm are flattened at velocity vfS, the nondimensional strain rate E is equal
to:
E = Sm/(2vfS ) (5)
where is the bulk(substrate) strain rate. For strip having positive pre-strain p and its flow stress
following the power law:
f = K (p +)n (6)
, the bulk shear strength k is equal to Kpn / 3 when the von Mises yield criterion is adopted. On the
other hand, the initial yield stress Y of strip as received is employed for the strip without pre-strain or
when the calculated flow stress is smaller than Y. Under such circumstances, the shear strength k is
equal to Y/ 3 .
Since no bulk strain rate is produced as the strip is compressed, the theoretical H can be computed
with E= 0 by letting
p / k = AH = 2A/ f2 (A) (7)
The A can be calculated from the above equation since p and k are given. The theoretical hardness H is
thus determined by substituting A into 2/ f2 (A); On the other hand, the experimental asperity hardness
is equal to
H = pc / k (8)
, according to Eq. (1) and Eq. (2).
Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show the variations of the measured A and the H (both theoretical and
experimental) vs. the pre-strain for longitudinal and transverse cases, respectively. Under the same
apparent pressure, the contact area ratio decreases with increasing pre-strain due to the strain
hardening effect. However, the experimental hardness displays unacceptable discrepancies with the
theoretical hardness, which is close to 2+in all the cases. We may also plot the hardness with respect
to the contact area ratio, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. It can be seen that the greater experimental
hardness is usually associated with small and large contact area ratios. Again the theoretical hardness
is nearly a constant.
To unveil the enigma about hardness, we must recall the definition of the experimental asperity
hardness: H = pc / k. Since the pc is directly calculated using the controlled pressure p and measured A,
we realize that the excessively high hardness should be attributed to the improper choice of the k. To
8=a -b = 0.4805+ 0.001882 (10)
Basically the contact area ratio plays an insignificant role inso that the effect of A can be neglected.
Eq. (10) indicates that an increase in the strain, 0.00182, takes place beneath the indentor as the
asperity slope becomes zero; however, is equal to zero in Wilson and Sheu’s model. For specimen
having pre-strainp in the bulk is flattened by a plane tool, the strain on the asperity peaka is equal to
p +. Following the same procedures in the previous section, the contact area ratio and the hardness
can be determined. That is,
p / ka = p / [K(p +)n / 3 ] = AHa (11)
Both the experimental and computed contact area ratios are shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 for
longitudinal and transverse lay patterns, respectively. The average asperity angleis acquired from the
real profile across the original direction of the roughness lays. Wilson and Sheu’s theoretical values are
also plotted for comparison. It can be seen that the theory has been improved as the effects of asperity
angle and hardening are involved, particularly for the case of 88 MPa. Metamorphosing the surface to
an isotropic topography seems to bring minor difference to the accuracy of the model, since the
theoretical predictions for both roughness patterns are analogous.
To elude the latent drawback of the serrated model, the 1.2 mm-long, real free surface profiles cut
across the lays are also utilized in the FEM simulation of contact, as displayed in Fig. 12. The
boundary conditions are identical to those for the triangular model. The approaching motion of the tool
pauses when the apparent pressure is equal to 35, 57, or 88 MPa. The total contacting length of the
profile, as well as the equivalent stress at each node contacting the tool is recorded. The former is used
to calculate the contact area ratio, while the data of the equivalent stress are collected for the
evaluation of hardness. The hardness is found to be close to that of the serrated model. As depicted in
Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 for the comparisons of the contact area ratios, the results also demonstrate the high
similarity to that of the serrated model. Such a concordance validates the propriety of the formulations
derived.
Apparently, the discrepancy in the case of 88 MPa is not a consequence of the idealization of
asperity geometry. Some other prospective explanations have been tested out. First, we noted that part
of the material beneath the tool surface flowed outward the compression zone when the strip was
compressed and induced further decrease in strip thickness; generating an effect equivalent to
increasing the pre-strain. However, through cautious inspections, we found that the most serious
decrease in the thickness was as small as 1~2% at 88MPa and the additional bulk hardening was thus
negligible. Second, the constraints upon the velocity field in the FEM simulation might be adjusted, in
order to correspond with the squeezing of material mentioned antecedently. An elastic glass tool was
also tried to refine the simulation. However, we found that all these modifications gave even greater
contact area ratios. We therefore suppose that the adiabatic recrystallization engendered by the
high-pressure indentation is the core source of such an unusually high hardness. Our next target will
thus focus on verifying this deduction based on the theory of polycrystal plasticity.

(3) The ability to resist asperity flattening is a function of the asperity angle as well as the shear
strength on the asperity tip, which experiences more deformation than the substrate. The sharper
asperity undergoes more serious straining, therefore more hardening on its peak. Basically such a
strain increment is not affected by the degree of flattening. A quantitatively description of this ability,
defined as the“asperity hardness,”is suggested. The shear strength on the asperity tips, rather than the
workpiece bulk, is adopted in the new formulation.
(4) The calculated contact area ratios are in good agreement with the experiments except for very
high pressures where additional mechanics such as the adiabatic recrystallization might happen.
(5) The concept of the additional hardening on asperity peaks can be employed to refine the
prediction of asperity contact in the analysis of metal forming.
