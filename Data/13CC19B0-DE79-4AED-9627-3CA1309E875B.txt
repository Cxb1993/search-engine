Abstract 
The influences of wind speed, net 
radiation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) 
on the evaporation rates of Class A pan, 
bare soil and the evapotranspiration rates of 
grasses were experimentally investigated in 
this study.  The results demonstrated that 
the evaporation (and evapotranspiration) 
rates increase as wind speed, net radiation 
and VPD increase.  Under the same wind 
speed, the ratio between the night-time and 
daytime evapotranspiration rate was 
54~67% for Paspalum notatum Flügge, the 
ratio was 60~67% for Axonopus 
compressus (Sw.) P. Beauv.  It was also 
found that the initial water depth in the pan 
will affect the pan evaporation rates.  
Under the same wind speed U = 6 m/s, the 
evaporation rate of water depth change 
from 15 cm to 11 cm, the evaporation rate 
decreases about 0.8%; but when the water 
depth changes to 7 cm, the evaporation rate 
decreases 55%.  Based on the measured 
pan evaporation rates, a new wind function 
is proposed.  By comparing with the 
predictions of Thom et al. (1981), Pereira et 
al. (1995) and Rayner (2007), the model of 
Thom et al. (1981) integrate with the new 
wind function gives the best prediction.  
The evaporation rates of bare soil and 
the evapotranspiration rates of grasses were 
compared with the prediction of FAO-56 
PM equation and Penman-Monteith 
equation. The comparison shows that the 
predictions of FAO-56 PM equation and 
Penman-Monteith equation for the 
evaporation rate of bare soil are better than 
for that for the evapotranspiration rates of 
grasses.

where Cpa is the specific heat of moist air [J 
kg-1 C-1], aρ  is the air density [kg m-3], 
and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. 
Pereira et al. (1995) suggested in neutral

where κ (= 0.4) is the von Karman constant, 
Uz is the wind speed measured at height z, 
zo is the roughness length, and zd is the 
zero-plane displacement height. Campbell 
and Norman (1998) suggested another 
equation to calculate the aerodynamic 
resistance of heat and vapor transfers from 
the “canopy surface”:

⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞− −⋅⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠= κ  
where zoh is the roughness length governing 
heat and vapor transfers. Brutsaert (1982) 
suggested the relation: zoh = 0.1zo for fully 
cover, uniform crops.   
 Rotstayn et al. (2006) modified the 
evaporation model of Linacre (1994) and 
used the wind function suggested by Thom 
et al. (1981) to evaluate the pan evaporation 
of Australia. They found their model 
performed well as compared with the field 
observations in Australia.  
 All the studies cited above used data 
collected in the field to verify their models, 
yet wind speed, radiation, air temperature 
and humidity are usually unsteady in the 
field. Therefore, the evaporation models 
and wind functions based on the daily 
average of meteorological variables and 
evaporation rates contain a great amount of 
uncertainty (Winter, 1981; Lowe et al., 
2009). In this study, a series of wind tunnel 
experiments were carried out to study the 
influences of wind speed and water depth 
on the evaporation rates of the Class A 
evaporimeter pan. Based on the 
experimental results, a predictive model for 
pan evaporation rate was developed. 　 
  
三、Experimental setup： 
 The experiment was carried out in an 
open-circuit, suction-type wind tunnel.  Its 
test section is 3.0 m wide, 2.1 m high and 
18.6 m long.  A standard-size class A 
evaporation pan (diameter 120.7 cm, depth 
20 cm) and three pots were placed on the 
floor of the test section.  A water-level 
sensor with a resolution of 0.76 mm inside 
the pan was used to record water depths 
automatically.  Five halogen lamps (each 
2500W) were installed 1.5 m above the 
floor of the test section to supply artificial 
radiation.  The schematic diagram of 
experimental setup is shown in Figure 1.  
 Net radiation Rn was measured by a net 
radiometer (Q7-1, Campbell Scientific Inc.) 
placed 40 cm above the wind tunnel floor.  
The wind effect on the measured radiation 
was corrected by using the correction 
function supplied by the manufacturer.  
The photosynthetically active radiation 
(PAR) was measured by a quantum sensor 
(LI-190SZ, LI-COR Inc.)  A 
hygrotransmitter (HD9008TR, Delta Ohm 
Inc.) was installed in front of the pan to 
measure the air temperature (resolution 
±0.1oC) and relative humidity (resolution 
±2%).  The water temperature in the pan 
was measured by a thermocouple.  All the 
climatic parameters were recorded by a data 
logger (CR10X, Campbell Scientific Inc.) at 
10 seconds sampling interval and 1 minute 
average value was stored in the data logger.  
 There are three pots (33 cm × 23 cm, 
depth 11 cm) that filled with loamy sand.  
The first pot was filled bare soil with no 
grass. Two different types of grasses, 
Paspalum notatum Flügge and Axonopus 
compressus (Sw.) P. Beauv. were planted in 
 5
experiments were carried out in daytime.  
The measured net radiation Rn = 0 W m-2.    
It confirms that the evaporation rates of 
bare soil and evapotranspiration rates of 
grasses increased as wind speed increased.  
The evapotranspiration rates of grass 1 are 
unfailingly larger than the ETm of grass 2, 
and the ETm of both grasses are larger than 
the evaporation rate of bare soil under the 
same wind speed.  The measured LAI = 
2.88 m2 m-2 for grass 1, LAI = 1.72 m2 m-2 
for grass 2.  As expected, the 
evapotranspiration rate is proportional to 
the value of LAI.  
 Wind speed experiments were carried 
out for grasses during night-time (after 
21:00, without any artificially light) also.  
Figure 3 compares the evapotranspiration 
rates of daytime and night-time experiments.  
The night-time evapotranspiration rates of 
both grasses were consistently smaller than 
the daytime values under the same wind 
speed.  This indicates that the stomata are 
partial open at night when wind speed U is 
larger than zero.  The ratio between 
night-time and daytime evapotranspiration 
rate was 53.7~66.7% for grass 1, the ratio 
was 60.4~66.5% for grass 2 (see Table 2).  
The ratio is comparable to the value 
49~53% found by Chu et al. (2009) for 
plant Pachira macrocarpa.   
 The effects of wind speed on the 
evaporation rate of Class A pan is shown in 
Figure 4.  The initial water depth h in the 
pan was 15 cm, net radiation Rn = 0 W m-2.  
The dash line, solid line and dot lines are 
the prediction of Thom et al. (1981), Rayner 
(2007), Pereira et al. (1995) respectively.  
The dash dot line is the prediction of 
Penman-style equation. The pan 
evaporation rate Epan increased as wind 
speed increased.  The pan evaporation rate 
ranged from 0.23 mm day-1 at U = 0 m/s to 
5.6 mm day-1 at U = 6 m s-1.   
 Measured pan evaporation rates are 
compared with prediction of Thom et al. 
(1981), Pereira et al. (1995) and Rayner 
(2007).  In the wind speed experiments, 
the net radiation Rn is close to zero and the 
change of heat storage S is assumed to be 
zero.  It shows that Pereira et al. (1995) 
gives the best prediction with RMSE = 
1.246 mm day-1, MBE = 0.958 mm day-1 
and d = 0.926.  Figures 5, 6 and 7 
respectively show the prediction of Pereira 
et al. (1995), Thom et al. (1981) and Rayner 
(2007) with the measured data.  
 In this study, wind speed Uz is 
measured at height z = 0.6 m.  The height 
of the grass is hc = 0.12 m.  Based on the 
wind profile measurement, it is found that 
the roughness length zo = 0.537 cm, the 
zero-plane displacement height zd = 0, zoh = 
0.1zo, and the von Karman constant κ = 0.4.  
 Based on the measured pan evaporation 
rates, the values of f(U) could be calculated 
from Penman-style equation.  Figure 8 
presents the comparison of different wind 
functions.  A new version of wind function 
is proposed as:  
 1
2
1 Uf (U)
1 U
+α= +α    
where 1 3.1α = , 2 0.18α = . Table 6 shows 
the statistical indicators of above wind 
functions.  A linear wind function is also 
proposed:  
 f (U) 1.375U 1.914= +    
Table 6 shows the statistical indicators of 
above wind functions.  The above wind 
function has the best agreement.   
 In order to investigate the effects of 
initial water depth on the evaporation rate 
of Class A pan, experiments with different 
water depths were carried out under the 
same wind speed U = 6 m s-1, net radiation 
Rn = 0 W m-2.  As can be seen in Figure 9, 
the evaporation rate decreased as the water 
depth decreased.  The water depth change 
from 15 cm to 11 cm, the evaporation rate 
decreases about 0.8%; but when the water 
depth changes to 7 cm, the evaporation rate 
decreases 55%.  It is believed that the 
shelter effect caused by the rim of the pan 
reduces the wind speed that blow over the 
 7
rs = 0.37 s m-1 for bare soil.  Figure 14 also 
shows that the prediction of 
Penman-Monteith equation for the 
evaporation rate of bare soil is better than 
for the evapotranspiration rates of grasses.  
 
5. Conclusions  
 In this study, a series of controlled 
experiments were carried out to study the 
effects of wind speed, net radiation, vapor 
pressure deficit on the evaporation rates of 
Class A pan, bare soil and 
evapotranspiration rates two different kinds 
of grass.  In wind speed experiments, it is 
clear that the evapotranspiration rates 
increased as wind speed increased.  Under 
the same wind speed, the night-time 
evapotranspiration rates of both grasses 
were smaller than the daytime values under 
the same wind speed.  The ratio between 
night-time and daytime evapotranspiration 
rate was 53.7~66.7% for grass 1, the ratio 
was 60.4~66.5% for grass 2.  This 
indicates that the stomata are incomplete 
close at night when wind speed U is larger 
than zero.   
 It was also found that the initial water 
depth in the pan will affect the pan 
evaporation rates.  Under the same wind 
speed U = 6 m s-1, the water depth change 
from 15 cm to 11 cm, the evaporation rate 
decreases about 0.8%; but when the water 
depth changes to 7 cm, the evaporation rate 
decreases 55%.  The shelter effect caused 
by the rim of the pan reduces the wind 
speed and evaporation from the pan.  It is 
also found that when the water depth equal 
to 15 cm, wind could blow water over the 
edges on the pan when wind speed U = 7 m 
s-1.  That is to say the evaporation rate will 
be over-estimated at high wind speed, low 
radiation condition.   
 Based on the measured pan evaporation 
rates, a new version of wind function is 
proposed.  By comparing with the 
predictions of Thom et al. (1981), Pereira et 
al. (1995) and Rayner (2007), the model of 
Thom et al. (1981) integrate with the new 
wind function gives the best prediction.    
 The evaporation rates of bare soil and 
evapotranspiration rates of grasses were 
compared with the predictions of FAO-56 
PM equation and the original 
Penman-Monteith equation.  The results 
show that the predictions of FAO-56 PM 
equation and Penman-Monteith equation for 
the evaporation rate of bare soil are better 
than for the evapotranspiration rates of 
grasses.
