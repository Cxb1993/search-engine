Abstract 
This paper aims to validate the source description of the THOR BNCT beam via different measurement 
techniques in different phantoms. The measurement included (1) the absolute reaction rate measurement of a set of 
triple activation foils, (2) the neutron and gamma-ray dose rates measured by using the paired ionization chamber 
method, and (3) the relative reaction rate distributions obtained by using the indirect neutron radiography. Three 
source descriptions were tested, which are THOR-Y09, surface source file RSSA, and THOR50C. The tested 
results concluded that THOR-Y09 is a well validated source description not only for neutron components, but also 
for gamma-ray component.

1. Introduction 
In 2004, the Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor 
(THOR) at Hsinchu, a 2-MW TRIGA reactor, was 
modified into a boron neutron capture therapy 
(BNCT) facility with an intense epithermal neutron 
beam, reaching 1.07 x 10
9
 epithermal neutrons cm
-2
 
s
-1
 at 1.2 MW. A series of delicate beam dosimetry, 
characterization, and adjustment have been 
performed. For the BNCT, in addition to the boron 
distribution and concentration determination, the 
justness of the predicted dose delivery depends 
highly on the validness of the applied treatment 
planning system. A source description plays a very 
important role in the treatment planning system; it is 
necessary to validate the implemented source 
description of the used BNCT beam to ensure the 
correctness of the calculated dose. Correspondingly, 
it is of our interest to validate the performance of 
the THOR source description in different scenarios. 
To achieve such a purpose, this work applied the 
activation detectors, the indirect neutron 
radiography, and the paired ionization chambers as 
measuring tools. Validations were conducted in 
different PMMA phantoms. The following sections 
will detail the validation work. 
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1. Source Description 
Generally, a source description consists of 
neutron and gamma-ray components. At the THOR, 
the source description, denoted as THOR-Y09, 
includes four subsets: fast neutron, epithermal 
neutron, thermal neutron, and gamma-ray sources. 
THOR-Y09 was an experimentally adjusted version 
of the calculated source description THOR50C 
which has only one neutron and one gamma-ray 
sources. The neutron source adjustment utilized an 
innovative methodology named full-scale 
deconvolution which not only deconvoluted the 
energy distribution but also adjusted the angular and 
spatial distributions. Concerning the gamma-ray 
source, it was adjusted through a multi-cap 
magnesium-argon ionization chamber with the aid 
of Monte Carlo calculated detector response 
functions (Liu et al., 2010).  
In addition to THOR-Y09 and THOR50C, a 
surface source RSSA was created by using the well-
known Monte Carlo code MCNP5 (X-5 Monte 
Carlo Team, 2005) with a modified/improved 
reactor core and beam model. A surface source has 
an advantage that its azimuthal angle information is 
more faithful than a generalized source description 
(Albritton and Kiger, 2008). The calculated RSSA 
file has a size of 52 GB. Still, due to its non-
adjustable, non-portable, unable parallel properties, 
etc., it is only used for verification purpose and not 
for clinical use. 
phantom was against the exit of the 4-cm thick 
collimator, (c) phantom was against the exit of the 
1-cm thick collimator, and (d) the front surface of 
the phantom was 10 cm away from the beam exit 
without any collimators. The neutron flux mappings 
along the central plan inside the specially assembled 
PMMA phantoms were compared as well. The 
distance from their vertical central axes to the 
opening beam exit is 15 cm for both cases. All 
position work was done by four cross-hair lasers. 
3. Results and Discussions 
For the 21 x 21 x 21 cm
3
 PMMA phantom, Fig. 
3 shows the measured and calculated, absolute 
reaction rate distributions of the 
63
Cu(n,)64Cu 
reaction by using the indirect neutron radiography 
incorporating with instrumental activation analysis 
and by using MCNP with THOR-Y09, THOR50C, 
and the surface source RSSA file. Obviously, the 
source description THOR-Y09 works much better 
than THOR50C with regards to the measured result. 
Comparing the measured result to the THOR-Y09 
and RSSA results, although the RSSA and THOR-
Y09 results are similar, THOR-Y09 is obviously 
closer to the measured curve (< 5%). 
The relative reaction rate distributions along the 
central axis of the 21 x 21 x 21 cm
3
 cubic phantom, 
measured by using the indirect neutron radiography 
and calculated by using MCNP with THOR-Y09, 
are shown in Fig. 4 for different experimental 
configurations. All curves were normalized to their 
maximum value, 100%. Clearly, the three calculated 
curves have few to several percents higher values 
than measurement before the maximum point. After 
the maximum points, the calculated curves turn to 
be few percents lower than measurement. 
The difference between the normalized, 
calculated and measured 2D relative reaction rate 
distributions of the phantom shown in Fig. 1 is 
between -3.65% – 1.45%. For most of the positions, 
the differences are within 2.5%. Fig. 5 presents the 
difference maps of the phantom of Fig. 2 at the 0- 
and 4-cm height planes. For the 0-cm plane, the 
differences are between -3.1% – 1.45%; for the 4-
cm plane, the differences are within -4.7% – 0.99%. 
If a tolerance of 5% deviation is chosen as a 
criterion, THOR-Y09 could deliver reliable results 
mostly within the above requirement. 
Fig. 6 shows the reaction rates per atom of the 
AuAl, Cu and MnNi foils, as well as the total 
neutron and gamma-ray dose rates measured in the 
15 x 15 x 15 cm
3
 PMMA phantom at 7 different 
depths. The reaction rates calculated by MCNP with 
THOR-Y09 are quite close to the measured values. 
For the gamma-ray dose rate, the deviations are

The knowledge of gamma-ray spectrum highly affects the accuracy of the correspondingly derived
gamma-ray dose and the correctness of calculated neutron dose in the neutron/gamma-ray mixed ﬁeld
dosimetry when using the paired ionization chambers technique. It is of our interest to develop amethod
to determine the gamma-ray spectrum in a strong neutron/gamma-ray mixed ﬁeld. The current type
detector, Mg(Ar) ionization chamber with 6 different thick caps incorporated with the unfolding
technique, was used to determine the gamma-ray spectrum in the THOR epithermal neutron beam,
which contains intense neutrons and gamma rays. The applied caps had nominal thicknesses from 1 to
6 mm. Detector response functions of the applied Mg(Ar) chamber with different caps were calculated
usingMCNP5with a validated chambermodel. The spectrum unfolding process was performed using the
well-known SAND-II algorithm. The unfolded result was foundmuch softer than the originally calculated
spectrum at the design stage. A large portion of low energy continuum was shown in the adjusted
spectrum. This work gave us a much deeper insight into the THOR epithermal neutron beam and also
showed a way to determine the gamma-ray spectrum.

1. Introduction
Due to the accompanying secondary neutron and gamma-ray
radiations, the concerns with the radiation protection and the
secondary cancer risk increase with the increase in the number of
high energy radiotherapy machines, such as hadron therapy
accelerators and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) beams.
Hence, the accuracy of the neutron/gamma-ray mixed ﬁeld dosi-
metry has gathered appreciable importance in recent years. It is
especially of our interest to study the gamma-ray spectra of the
increasing epithermal neutron beams for BNCT, which is a very
strong neutron/gamma-ray mixed ﬁeld. The epithermal neutron
beam not only consists of neutrons, but also contains pronounced
gamma rays that contribute to the undesired background dose. It is
almost impossible to have a pure epithermal neutron beam due to
the unavoidable neutron interactions with structure materials,
which leads to a cascade of prompt gamma rays and delayed
component via activation.
Accurately separating the gamma-ray component from the total
measured dose is the only way to correctly estimate the neutron
dose when using the paired ionization chambers method, which is
commonly applied in themixed ﬁeld dosimetry [1–3]. The correct-
ness of the gamma-ray dose, however, highly counters on the
knowledge of the incident gamma-ray spectrum. In other words,
the gamma-ray spectrum not only affects the accuracy of gamma-
ray dose, but also concerns the correctness of the derived
neutron dose.
Generally, the gamma-ray source spectrum is determined by
Monte Carlo calculations, and its absolute source strength is
thereafter scaled according to a correspondingly measured dose
rate. Such a gamma-ray source adjustment/treatment is normally
satisfactory when the accuracy of the background dose is not in a
serious manner. Nevertheless, at the Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor
(THOR), the beam gamma-ray contribution originated from the
epithermal neutron beam to the total background dose is about
5–15% (calculated) depending on the depth of the tissue. For the
purpose of better Q2patient protection, it would seem advisable to
investigate the gamma-ray spectrum of the THOR BNCT beam by
means of other measurements in addition to the Monte Carlo
calculation.
Regarding neutron spectra of epithermal neutron beams, they
have been widely studied due to their direct relevance to the
delivered boron dose. On the contrary, the gamma-ray spectrum/
source is a much less discussed issue [10,11]. Generally, the
gamma-ray spectrum can be determined using the pulse-type

made by Exradin. The Mg(Ar) ionization chamber is widely used in
the mixed ﬁeld dosimetry as the gamma-ray dosimeter due to its
insensitivity to neutrons.
The used Mg(Ar) chamber has an active volume of 0.53 c.c., and
its wall is 1 mm thick. The applied electrometer was MAX-4001
manufactured by Standard Imaging, Inc. The detection system also
included a thermometer and a hygrometer for the sake of environ-
mental standardization (normalized to 1 atm, 22 1C). A homemade
computer program was applied to record the real-time current
data. Thewhole systemwas periodically calibrated using a primary
60Co source and a primary X-ray beam at the Institute of Nuclear
Energy Research, Taiwan.
The Mg(Ar) ionization chamber system was equipped with 6
build-up caps of different thicknesses, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and
6 mm. The same Mg(Ar) chamber system was previously used in
the work of Raaijmakers et al. [11] for the investigation of the
average gamma-ray energy of the HB11 beam. The multi-cap
ionization chamber system is of similar function as thewell-known
Bonner sphere spectrometer.
Measurements were performed free-in-air at the beam opening
center with a reactor power of 1.2 MW. A delicate laser systemwas
used for the precise positioning. The gas ﬂow ratewas carefully and
steady controlled at 20 c.c. per minute. The applied high voltage
was 300 V.
2.3. Detector response functions
Varying the wall thickness changes the detector response
function to the unknown radiation spectrum. Each cap has its
unique response to the energy spectrum and is sensitive to certain
energy groups. To retrieve energy information from the measured
current of the ionization chamber, ﬁrstly it is necessary to know
how thedetector responds in the radiationﬁeld. For such a sake, the
Monte Carlo code MCNP5 was applied to calculate the detector
response functions to different incident gamma-ray energies. The
geometry of the Mg(Ar) ionization chamber was modeled in great
detail in the calculation. The chamber model had been tested and
validated in other studies [14,15]. The electron transport option
DBCN(18) was set as 1, which adopted the Integrated Tiger Series
mode. The same calculation method conducted in the authors’
previous study [16] was used to generate the 20-group energy
response functions of the7different thicknesses. Energydeposition
caused by source gamma rays in the detector cavity was calculated
using *F8 tally. The tallied energy deposition Edep (MeV) can be
converted to the charge Q (pC) created in the argon gas by simply
using the following equation:
Q ¼ 0:1602 Edpt
WAr
ð1Þ
whereWAr (26.4 eV) is the average energy required to create an
ion pair in argon gas. Note that the angular and spatial information
of the gamma-ray source was included in the calculation.
2.4. Spectrum unfolding
Although the above detector response functions provide the
information how the detector responds to the source gamma rays,
one still needs an unfolding algorithm to ﬁnd the suitable solution
(source spectrum) from the inﬁnite combinations. The homemade
unfolding program SAND-EX was applied in this work, which uses
the same algorithm as the well-known SAND-II [4,17]. Conven-
tionally in the reactor dosimetry, the physical quantities used in the
spectrum unfolding program are reaction rate per atom (detector
responses) and activation cross-sections (detector response func-
tions). In this work, the quantities were modiﬁed to detector cha-
rge and the MCNP calculated detector response functions. The
dominating equation of evaluating the detector response, i.e. the
charge Q created in the Mg(Ar) chamber, is given below:
Q ¼ 0:1602
WAr
X20
g ¼ 1
Sgfdep,g ð2Þ
where g is the index number of the gamma-ray energy group; Sg
is the source strength of the gth group, and fdep,g is the calculated
detector response (energy deposition, MeV) to the gth-group
source gamma ray.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Calculated response functions
The calculated response functions of the 7 caps are shown in
Fig. 3. For energy groups having large responses, their calculation
errors were lower than 1%, while errors of those insensitive groups
were around 3–5% except for the 1st energy group of the 7 mmwall
thickness (6 mm cap) whose statistical error was 100% due to its
very rare response. Since the responses of insensitive groups are
about 10 times lower than the more sensitive groups, they
contribute rarely to the total response and thus their statistical
errors are consequently acceptable or ignorable.
From Fig. 3, it is clear that the sensitivities to low energy groups
decreasewith the increase of the cap thickness,while the responses
to high energy groups are the other way round. In other words, the
thicker thewall thickness, the lesser theMg(Ar) chamber responds
to low energy gamma rays. For high energy gamma rays, the above
phenomenon swaps. Low energy gamma rays encounter much
more considerable attenuation and scattering when the wall
thickness increases, which results in very low responses in the
thicker caps. On the contrary, the thicker caps have higher
probability to interact with high energy gamma rays. As such,
the responses of thicker caps are mostly contributed from high
energy gamma rays.
3.2. Calculated andmeasured responses of 7 differentwall thicknesses
Fig. 4 (left axis) presents the normalized, predicted Mg(Ar)
chamber responses calculated for the 7 wall thicknesses using the
original gamma-ray spectrum. Clearly, the curve shows a signiﬁ-
cant build-up effect (rising curve) as a result of the hard energy
spectrum. The 2.65 MeV electron can penetrate 9.28 mm thick

radiation transport codes had been developed by different groups.
Most of them have similar mechanism for gamma-ray transport,
while the algorithms for electron simulation are somehow different
[4–9]. Therefore, this work aims to verify how differentMonte Carlo
codes perform in calculating the Mg(Ar)-ionization-chamber
responses to the given gamma-ray ﬁelds. Furthermore, benchmark
validations in 4 different gamma-ray beams are shown in this paper
as well. The following Materials and methods section presents the
veriﬁcation and validation benchmark setup.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Mg(Ar) ionization chamber
The chosen Mg(Ar) chamber is a thimble type M2 chamber
made by Exradin with a nominal active volume of 0.53 cm3. and a
wall thickness of 1 mm. The chamber was ﬂushed with pure argon
gas at a steady ﬂow rate of 20 cm3 min1. All the measurements
were performed with the addition of a 2-mm thick build-up cap to
achieve charged particle equilibrium in the chamber wall. The
purity of the Mg wall and cap is higher than 99% as indicated in
authors’ previous Ref. [10].
In order to obtain a reliable comparison, the wall and cap
thicknesses were carefully measured using X-ray imaging. The
measured thickness was further validated by comparison between
calculation and measurement basing on the build-up trend in 60Co
gamma-ray beam.
2.2. Monte Carlo codes and veriﬁcations
The chosen Monte Carlo codes were the widely used MCNP5
(Ver. 1.51), MCNPX (Ver. 2.6), EGSnrc (Ver. 4 release series 2.3.1),
FLUKA (Ver. 2008.3), and GEANT4 (Ver. 4.9.3). It was especially of
our interests to understand the performance of MCNP5 due to the
practical need of BNCT application. The above codes can be
categorized into two classes as deﬁned byM. Berger [11] according
to how the codes simulate the electron condensed history, i.e. the
treatment of collisional and radiative energy loss. For Class I
code, all interactions are divided into ‘‘hard’’ and ‘‘soft’’ collisions;
namely, primary and secondary particles are always correlated. On
the other hand, for Class II code, all interaction cross-sections
(energy loss rate, energy straggling, multiple scattering, knock-on
electron, bremsstrahlung, etc.) are calculated basing on a ﬁxed
energy grid. EGSnrc, FLUKA and GEANT4 are Class I code, while
MCNP5 and MCNPX belong to Class II code.
In order to eliminate the geometry difference and to obtain a
better calculation efﬁciency, a simple spherical shape, as shown
in Fig. 1(a), was used to represent theMg(Ar) ionization chamber in
all the codes. Such a simpliﬁcation made the comparisons per-
formed in a consistent manner. For the purpose of veriﬁcation, the
following scenario was applied: the chamber was exposed to a
mono-energetic parallel photon beam whose energy varied from
20 keV to 20 MeV. All relevant interaction processes were taken
into account, including the Rayleigh scattering and the incoherent
scattering. The cut-off energy of both gamma-ray and electron was
set at 1 keV. The latest cross-section library of each code was
applied. The detector response was deﬁned as the dose scored in
the chamber cavity per unit incident ﬂuence.
For EGSnrc, the user code CAVSPHnrc was employed and the
electron-step algorithm parameter PRESTA-II was adopted, which
allowed the application of relatively large electron steps without
introducing artifacts. For FLUKA, calculations were performed
under the EMF mode. As to GEANT4, the Standard photon and
electron interaction processes were used for the best computation
efﬁciency.
For MCNP5 and MCNPX, the detector response functions were
scored using the nF8 tally. Themagnesiumwall and anodewere set
as conductor in the calculations. For the sake of reliability, the
number of sub-steps per energy grid, i.e. ESTEP of the argon gaswas
increased to 10,000 by introducing the ESTEPE parameter in the
material card. Note that, EGSnrc and FLUKA have been reported as
independent of the electron step length ESTEPE. [12,13].
In MCNP5 version 1.51, there are three different Landau strag-
gling logics available in electron transport algorithms. The ﬁrst one
is the default ‘‘MCNP-style’’, which uses the bin-centered treatment
(the 18th input of DBCN card¼0); the second one is the ‘‘ITS-style’’,
which uses the nearest-group-boundary treatment (DBCN(18)¼1);
the last one is the detailed Landau straggling sampling logic, which
uses the energy- and step-speciﬁc treatment (DBCN(18)¼2). This
study mostly used the default and ITS modes. The detailed Landau
straggling sampling logic was still being tested [14] and it was only
used for test in ourwork aswell. ForMCNPX, only the ITS-modewas
applied.
To validate the calculated results by measurement, a sophisti-
cated, near-reality Mg(Ar) chamber model was built for MCNP5,
MCNPX, and FLUKA calculations according to the technical drawing
provided by Exradin [15]. The near-reality model is shown in
Fig. 1(b). For EGSnrc and GEANT4, the simple spherical model was
still used for the validationwork due to the costly effort of building
the complicated model in these two codes.
2.3. Validation in benchmark gamma-ray ﬁelds
For a given gamma-ray beam with a known air collision kerma
rate _KC,air (Gy s
1) and energy spectrum, the spectrum weighted
beam ﬂux fg (g cm2 s1) can be derived using the following
equation:

Fig. 1. Two geometry models were used to study the energy-dependence of the
Mg(Ar) chamber. One is (a) the simple spherical model and the other one is (b) the
sophisticated near-reality IC model according to the detailed drawing provided by
Exradin.

geometry dependence is ignorable, the simple spherical could be
used instead of the near-realitymodel for the sake of efﬁciency. The
reason why the near-reality model worked merely equal or worse
compared to the spherical model, might be due to the manufactur-
ing tolerance of the real chamber, especially thewall thickness and
the size of active volume. It is not easy to solidly conﬁrm that the
wall and cap thickness were everywhere the same over the real
chamber and cap, even using the X-ray image. Furthermore, the
upper part of the chamber (gas tube, triaxial cable, gas insulation,
etc.) was ideallymodeledwhichmight not be exactly like the truth.
These slightly increased the calculation uncertainty of the near-
reality model. Nevertheless, the simple spherical model is angular
independent and could only be applied in certain cases.
From the calculated responses functions in Fig. 2, EGSnrc had
higher response than FLUKA in X-ray energy range. Thus, the
underestimation of FLUKA indicated that EGSnrc should have a
closer result in theM-100 beam. In other words, for energies lower
than 100 keV, EGSnrc had better performance than FLUKA; it was
also better than MCNP-ITS. For energy region between 100 keV
and 3 MeV, EGSnrc was like MCNP-ITS, which had excellent
matcheswith themeasured currents in the 60Co and 10-MVbeams.
Generally speaking, EGSnrc showed very reliable performance
within the range from X-ray energy to 3 MeV. For energies higher
than 3 MeV, a reliable gamma-ray ﬁeld has to be established for the
benchmark validation. Still, MCNP-ITS could work properly in a
hard-spectrumgamma-ray ﬁeld.When in a lowenergy gamma-ray
ﬁeld, MCNP-ITS would possibly underestimate the chamber
response.
Nevertheless, concerning the application in BNCT, MCNP-ITS is
considered an ideal candidate in detector response calculation. The
BNCT epithermal neutron beam commonly contains considerable
2.2 MeV prompt gamma rays induced in hydrogen capture reac-
tions. That is to say, the contribution from low energy gamma rays,
the relatively weak part of MCNP-ITS, is much less in such a
scenario. Although EGSnrc had better performance in the photon–
electron calculation, it lacks the ability of neutron transport
calculation, which dramatically weakens its application in the
mixed ﬁeld dosimetry.
4. Conclusions
This work calculated the Mg(Ar)-ionization-chamber response
functions to gamma rays of energies from 20 keV to 20 MeV using
EGSnrc, FLUKA, GEANT4, MCNP5 as well as MCNPX, and demon-
strated the difference among these codes. The comparisons
between the calculated response functions showed that, except
MCNP5-ITS and MCNPX-ITS, none of the codes could duplicate the
results of another code, i.e. theywere all different. Users should pay
great attention to the code they use in evaluating their detector.
Moreover, the code validations were carried out in the 4
benchmark gamma-ray ﬁelds, which directly compared the mea-
sured and calculated current. According to the validation results,
EGSnrc had the most stable and the best performance from X-ray
energy to 3 MeV. In the low energy region, MCNP-ITS and FLUKA
both underestimated the detector responses. In the high energy
region, FLUKA apparently had some overestimation (o4%).MCNP-
ITS showed satisfactorymatcheswith themeasured currents in the
60Co and 10-MV beams. For the BNCT application, MCNP is still the
most ideal candidate. In regard to the validation for energies higher
than 3 MeV, a further work is now under progress using an 18-MV
therapeutic beam.

二、 與會心得 
  硼中子捕獲治療(Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, BNCT)發展已有約四十年歷
史，目前全世界共有七個國家有 BNCT 設施，並已開始人體治療，現今世界上最為活
躍之 BNCT 團隊係日本以及芬蘭，其治療病人數目已超過千人。台灣團隊在本次研討
會除了與世界各國進行意見交換，另外一個重要任務便是在會議中發表目前台灣在
硼中子捕獲治療之臨床試驗成果。 
  大會開始之前一天下午進行了註冊事宜以及大會委員會議，本校原科中心劉淵
豪博士代周鳳英教授參加委員會議，並於會中提案爭取 2014 年第十六屆 ICNCT 於台
灣主辦；經熱烈討論後，可惜仍因為舉辦國家有地域輪替之不成文傳統而未能成功，
即便如此，劉博士精彩的報告已將台灣 BNCT 團隊現狀及臨床試驗成果作初步展現，
並引起世界各國委員非常高度之興趣。 
  本次會議於不同時間區塊分別列有 plenary session、parallel session 以及 poster 
session，並於各區塊針對不同領域範疇再加以細分；其中台灣團隊於 parallel session
共計有口頭發表八篇，其中清大七篇、台北榮總一篇，另於 poster session 計有海報
發表兩篇。 
 
圖 1. 大會入口海報（左）、筆者與歡迎海報（中）及發表海報合影（右） 
  會議第一天先由主辦國阿根廷團隊進行簡單的開幕儀式，接著為 Hatanaka 
Award Lectures，Hatanaka Award 係紀念已逝世之 Dr. Hatanaka 對 BNCT 之貢獻所設置，
歷屆以來皆邀請該屆獲獎人發表演講作為開場。此獎今年由日本 Dr. Kobayashi、Dr. 
Matsumura 以及 Dr. Ono 所獲得並分別進行演說，內容從 BNCT 回顧，包含最初期的
原理構想、藥物研發合成之進展、治療技術的精進，一直到目前日本京都大學反應
器研究所(Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute, KURRI)正在建造中之加速器硼中
子捕獲治療(Accelerator-Based Boron Neutron Capture Therapy, AB-BNCT)設施；三場演
講下來讓與會成員更加了解前人們過去的努力，同時亦對未來建立了充滿希望的願
景。 
  會議的最後一天早上，台北榮總王令瑋主任上台進行口頭報告，內容為台灣目
前在 BNCT 臨床試驗的初步成果，雖然大會未安排在 plenary session，但現場討論仍
舊熱烈，且報告後有相當多與會成員前來討論並表達高度興趣，此顯示台灣團隊在
BNCT 領域的研究能力及治療技術已受到相當高的注意。 
  本屆會議現除了芬蘭、日本等 BNCT 發展完善之團隊之外，義大利、阿根廷、德
國等國亦迅速茁壯中，且中國大陸也在本次會議中發表將建造 BNCT 治療用反應器，
日本團隊更挾帶世界第一座 AB-BNCT 設施之勢進行演說。台灣之 BNCT 團隊在數年來
已參與多屆 BNCT 相關會議，經過長時間的努力，在清華大學以及台北榮總的合作之
下，目前已成功將 BNCT 推向臨床試驗階段，並將目前成果順利在本屆 ICNCT 發表，
初試啼聲結果獲得極大的迴響；同時，本校原科中心劉淵豪博士與台北榮總王令瑋
主任在經過會員大會投票選舉之後，分別當選 Physics/Engineering 以及
Medicine/Clinical 之 Board of Councilor，使得台灣團隊在 BNCT Society 當中更加具有
影響力。清華大學在核工領域固然一直有著極佳的研發能力，但人才之永續培育亦
不可忽視；筆者認為雖然目前台灣在核工的趨勢較為集中於核能電廠部分，即便如
此，應當同時鼓勵核工所與工科系學生多多參與輻射應用方面的研究，並增加與國
外研究機構交流的機會，避免閉門造車，讓台灣之核工領域學生能夠與世界接軌，
