2placement sensor with self-actuating capabilities. A
linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) will
be converted into a transducer that functions as a
linear actuator as well as a displacement sensor.
The LVDT is a robust, high-resolution displacement
sensor since it has no electrical contact between the
moving element and the transducer’s coils. LVDT’s
are usually installed on a linear motor or actuator for
servo control. A sub micron positioning system can
be achieved by an LVDT-equipped piezoactuator
[13]. One drawback for a system to install an LVDT
is the extra space needed for the sensor. By making
it function as an integrated sensor and actuator, the
size and cost of a servomechanism can be reduced.
This report presents a prototype of the LVDT
actuator. Linearity and sensitivity of the device are
measured. Actuation forces exerted on the armature
are also measured by a high-resolution push-pull
meter. It is found that the force can be maximized
by energizing a specific combination of the pri-
mary coil and the two secondary coils according
to armature positions. An optimal switching table
is established. A simple PD algorithm and a more
sophisticated sliding-mode-plus-PD controller are
developed for closed-loop control of the LVDT core.
The controllers are implemented by an 8-bit micro-
computer. While the PD algorithm is able to achieve
a settling time of 0.13 seconds and positioning
errors of 0.02 mm, repeated experiments show that
the sliding-mode-plus-PD controller yields superior
repeatability in overall performance.
II. SUPERPOSITION OF AC AND DC SIGNALS
Figure 1 shows an LVDT with a simple circuit
to isolate the ac excitation signal from the dc
actuating currents. Since the inductor appears as a
high impedance to the ac signal but a low impedance
to the dc currents, the harmonic signals are blocked
away from the dc source while the dc currents
are allowed through the inductor to energize the
coils. By contrast, the capacitors appear as a low
impedance to high-frequency signals but a high
impedance to the dc source, so that the harmonic
sensing signals are passed through to reach the mea-
surement circuits while the dc currents are blocked
away.
The problem with Fig. 1 is that for good isolation
of dc and ac signals large inductors and capaci-
tors are needed, resulting in bulky components and
slow system responses. Exploiting the fact that the
frequency of the harmonic excitation is constant
and known, more efficient block-and-pass circuit is
designed as in Fig. 2. In this modified circuit, an
LC pair is used instead of the single inductor to
block a constant-frequency signal. This is because
the LC pair appears as an infinite impedance for a
signal of 1=2
p
LC Hz, which is the resonant of
the LC circuit. The harmonic excitation is set at this
resonant frequency so that it will be well isolated
from the dc source. The inductance chosen for the
LC pair can be much smaller than is required for a
single inductor.
In place of the coupling capacitor, a narrow-
band active filter is used in Fig. 2 to pass the
induced harmonic signals. It is a 2nd-order tuned-
circuit filter that can be conveniently built using
an active-filter IC (UAF42). The center frequency
is set at 16.2 kHz, same as the excitation signal.
Signals at other frequencies, lower or higher, are
effectively attenuated. Such a design prevents high-
frequency transient signals (due to switching of
the ”dc” power input) as well as low frequency
actuating currents from reaching the LVDT signal
conditioning circuits.
III. SENSITIVITY AND FORCE-DISPLACEMENT
CURVES
The sensitivity curves of the LVDT actuator are
measured with a signal conditioning IC (AD598).
The harmonic excitation signal is also generated by
the signal conditioning IC. The induced signals of
the secondary coils are filtered by the bandpass filter
and then measured by AD598, which converts the
differential sine wave into a dc voltage proportional
to the armature displacement.
Figure 4 shows the curves of the output voltage
from the signal conditioner versus armature posi-
tions. The measurements are repeated for different
dc energizing voltages from 0 to 5V. It is seen that
the lines shift slightly upward with the applied volt-
4The settling times are about 0.1  0.13 seconds, and
the steady-state errors are from 0.02 mm to 0.06
mm.
Sliding-mode-plus-PD control.
With the simple PD controller, the core of the
LVDT would occasionally “stick” to a position
some way off the target due to Coulomb friction.
The algorithm is modified by adding high-authority
feedback in the neighborhood of the target state.
Figure 11 shows the block diagram of the sliding-
mode-plus-PD control system. In this algorithm, the
following term is added to the PD controller:
us D k sat.eC ˇ Pe/ (4)
where sat.:/ denotes the saturation function.
Figure 12 shows a typical response with the
modified controller. It is seen that the control action
displays a mild “chattering” phenomenon due to
the high authority term of Eq. (4). To examine the
repeatability of the control system, experiments are
conducted 20 times for each target stroke. Table 1
shows the statistics of the experimental results. It is
seen that the maximum steady-state error is confined
to within 0.05 mm for any stroke between 1 and 4
mm.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND SELF-EVALUATIONS
A self-actuating displacement sensor is con-
structed from a linear variable differential trans-
former. Bandstop and bandpass filters are designed
to effectively isolate the high-frequency sensing
signals from the low-frequency actuating currents.
Linearity and sensitivity of the device are tested.
Forcing curves were also measured for three dif-
ferent energizing methods. A PD control algorithm
is implemented by an 8-bit microcontroller. Initial
testing shows that closed-loop control is achievable
with settling time of 0.13 seconds and positioning
errors of 0.02 to 0.06 mm. To tackle Coulomb
friction, a sliding-control term is added to the con-
troller. Repeated experiments show that friction can
be effectively overcome by the modified controller.
This two-year project has so far yielded one
journal paper [14], one patent filed (pending) [15],
and three master theses [16]-[18] related to this
project. Another journal paper is being compiled
and will be submitted shortly.
