Abstract 
In this report, we propose a visual 
authentication scheme that can be 
implemented in the mobile systems with 
the user identity authentication requests. 
In order to make clear the contributions 
we did in this paper, following our 
proposed scheme, an example with a law 
enforcement case presented to persuade 
the implementations feasible in wireless 
carry-on mobile device systems. In our 
scheme, basically, the shares are 
separately stored at two sides of user-end 
and data base of the system side. As long 
as the two right shared held at the two 
sides are stacked, the key-important secret 
is immediately gained. We also give the 
time stamp and random seed parameters 
when stacking the shares to succeed the 
authentication requests for a legitimate 
user. Compared to the past researches, the 
cost reduction, more flexible management, 
secret hierarchy, and easy access control 
in members and passwords are further 
offered in this paper study. Besides, the 
smart card is a key-bridge to make the 
system operation available whenever the 
identity authentication is requested, where 
pre-information is read from the smart 
card first, the system is then launched the 
next steps in our scheme.

二、緣起與目的 
    由於資訊時代的快速發展，爭相推
出多款具備無線網路連線功能之行動電
腦，而所謂的無線通訊傳輸，即是採用
無線電技術，來達成交換資訊的目的，
 4
步驟八：RC 接受註冊則賦予 User
帳號 PID,並儲存 Share-A i1、Share-Y 
i1、Share-X i2、PID 與 q1,q2,….. qn
於 Ui。儲存 Share-B i1、Index-t、PStp1
與 PStp2於 RC。 
¾ 驗證階段 
驗證階段的目的為 IA 確認 User 已
經由 RC 驗證，並藉此了解 User 的
相關資訊，可分為取得公開資料及
機密資料兩部分。 
¾ 雙向身分鑑定認證協定 
步驟一：User 傳送 PID，{{PID, Ta, 
L, qi}Kur}給 IA 請求登入，IA 檢查
後，將{{{PID, Ta, L, qi}Kur ,qi}Kir}傳
送給 RC。 
步驟二：RC 經比對 PID 與 qi 則隨
即透過 PStp2 ，運用 TA 函數，將內
存 Index-t 取得的第 t 張樣本影像轉
成(Share-Xi2)。 
步驟三：RC 隨機產生一個亂數值，
令為 Nonce，與解密所得的時戳 Ta
合併，製成與一張與 Share-X i2 同大
小之二元像素值影像 NI，再將 NI
與 Share-X i2 以 VC 處理產生另一張
二 元 像 素 值 的 子 圖 影 像 令 為
Share-Y i2，轉換 Share-Yi2 為二元碼
值 Dy2 與 H(Dy2)，再將{Share-Y i2, 
{H(D y2)} Kur ,{Ta,Nonce}Kir}給 IA。 
步 驟 四 ： IA 傳 送 {Share-Yi2,  
{H(D y2)}Kur}給 User，User 將它
與本身持有之 Share-X2 疊合，產
生 Ta 與 Nonce 以驗證 IA。 
步驟五：User 計算 H(Nonce+1, qi )
給 IA 以驗證 Ui。 
 
(二) 行動電腦的應用 
 
根據上述所提出之以視覺化方式來
達成身份認證目的，以現行執法人
員資訊系統架構及以無線通訊之行
動電腦應用情形，其三方可區分
為：執法人員 (User)、執法單位
(IA)、總局(RC)，分述如下： 
 
¾ 執法人員(User) 
以執法人員做為此認證協定之一般
使用者(User)，通常在執行勤務時，
需要針對可疑人士、車輛車號進行
盤查，而離線之可攜式裝置(如無線
通訊之行動電腦 )可儲存空間有
限，能提供資訊也有限，當利用此
認證協定，擴充功能，可連線至總
局資訊網時，即可即時查詢最新資
料，甚至上傳緊急通報事項，如此
可達到最佳的時效性，成為執法人
員之最佳利器。 
¾ 執法單位(IA) 
各執法單位建置 IA，管控 User 可
登入總局資訊系統之權限，由於執
法單位可管理轄內勤務狀況，因此
可有效掌握目前登入 User 可能的
使用情形，防止異常登入及資料外
洩情形發生。 
¾ 總局(RC) 
由總局建置全國統一之 RC，集中儲
存各項資訊，並協助建置各地執法
單位之 IA，由於總局與各地執法單
位間有專線連接，故可確保 IA 與
RC 連線之安全性。而各地執法單位
或執法人員之註冊資料有變動而通
報總局時，總局可藉由修改資料
庫，來變更其權限，由於總局擁有
資訊系統之各項資料庫，因此，做
為 RC 之角色，可掌握各 IA 及 User
的查詢狀況，並可針對異常行為，
予以中止連線、停權等措施。 
 
(三) 對無線網路攻擊分析 
 
以下將針對數種無線網路常見之攻
擊手法，分析視覺化身分認證模
式，可確實有效抵禦。

開金鑰加密傳輸訊息。 
4. 最低多餘特性(The Low Redundancy 
Property)：即去除多餘不必要的協定
步驟，藉此以最簡單的程序即可達到
鑑定。 
 
本研究中，所提出的視覺化多重身分鑑
定協定透過 BAN-Logic 的分析過程，證
明其在邏輯性及安全性上，確能符合一
項合於標準的鑑定協定的要求。在開始
分析鑑定協定前，需先轉換我們所提出
的方法變成理想化形式。基於理由假
設，在此鑑定協定的分析中，需依循下
列五個步驟  (Step1-Step5, S1-S5)來執
行： 
S1: 在 BAN-Logic 的情況下，需先定義
初始安全性假設，詳細描述如圖十三所
示。 
S2: 在正規化邏輯的情況下，需將鑑定
協定作理想化形式，詳細描述如圖十四
所示。 
S3: 使用邏輯法則來減少不必要的敘

3.  Our scheme 
3.1 Invasion of XSS 
 
After discussing the basic concept of XSS attacks, we will 
have a further understanding of the pattern of the attacks 
with three conditions. The three conditions which we 
proposed contain attacker, the victims and with XSS 
vulnerabilities website. We will analyze the four attacks 
procedures and relationship among them. In order to 
assist us when we investigate the crimes about XSS and 
seize digital evidence. 
 
The three conditions of XSS 
 
To accomplish XSS attacks need to meet the following 
three conditions [3], as shown in Figure 1. 
 
Condition I: Vulnerable website applications. 
There are many vulnerable application websites on the 
internet. As long as there are functions for editing HTML 
contents, discussion boards, guest books or Web Mail, it 
is possible to conduct XSS attack among them. We can do 
a simple test. You just need to input some sentence into 
<BODY></BODY> label. For example： <SCRIPT> alert 
("Hello World")</SCRIPT>. The next step is to use 
browser to browse this page. If your window jumps the 
"Hello World", it means that you can be attacked. 
Condition II: One or more victims. 
The victims simply visit some websites, aimed by 
attackers, and then steal the victims’ private information. 
Condition III: Malicious intruders or attackers. 
Perpetrators who understand the methods of XSS attack 
and have illegal intention. 
 
Four attack steps in XSS 
 
Malicious intruders 
or attackers
Vulnerable website 
application 
one or more victims
 Figure 1: The three conditions of XSS 
 
Under the considerations of the above-mentioned 
situations with the XSS, the procedure of attacks with 
four steps in XSS is launched to paralyze the systems 
depict as follows:   
 
Step 1: An attacker will find website applications with 
XSS vulnerabilities. 
Step 2: An attacker will send malicious code to 
discussion boards, guest books or link IP-
address on the websites. 
Step 3: When victims browse and login to the website 
(Cookies will establish), then he browses the 
page or link which was implanted with XSS code. 
At the same time, cookies and other private 
information will be recorded when code was 
executed. This information will return to the 
attacker or third part website where attacker 
builds it. 
Step 4: After attacker captures the victims’ cookies or 
private information, he will get the same authority 
and do whatever he want. 
XSS attacks divided into four main steps, as shown in 
Figure 2. First malicious intruders use tools to search for 
loopholes in the website then test the enforceability XSS 
attack and aims at the website. Malicious intruders will 
post virus code into the website. After visiting the 
infected website, the victims’ computer browser will 
implement XSS code. At this point victims’ private data 
or cookies may have transmitted back to the attacker.

Phase III: Lure attacker by Honey Pot, combining 
SSL-VPN technology 
When the victim reports a case to an investigator, in order 
to identify the attacker, we can use Honey Pot technology 
to lure attacker. Combining SSL-VPN technology to 
monitor the websites or victims and record the attacker's 
actions.  
 
3.3 The Defense Strategy of XSS 
To countermeasure the XSS attacks in internet intrusions, 
four key-strategies, S1-S4, are presented shown below to 
deter the pervasion from XSS attacks. 
 
S1. Filter and check the data form when they are send 
back to server 
It is difficult for users to control the browser what it really 
browses. Users also don’t know what attackers did. 
Therefore, an appropriate filter check strategy is essential 
to effectively prevent XSS attacks. Here are the two rules 
for checking the input and output data contents: 
z Confirm the data which was filled by users in 
the form.  
z The data provided by the users must be 
encrypted and encoded. Make sure that URL, 
HTML contents are encoded. In addition, 
website developers must set checking rules 
and test various attacks in order to enhance 
the security of the system. 
 
S2. The addition of Application Firewall 
In addition to target form, URL address filter check, the 
new generation of application firewall provides a web-
based applications protection program. Currently related 
products, such as Traffic Shield application firewall, 
aimed at corporate structure of the web security 
protection. Using safety logic, user session information, 
users input and respond contents of the content 
verification, it can resist Google hacking, XSS attacks and 
invasion of parameters [7], as shown in Figure 8.

Buffer Overflow
Cookie/Session Poisoning

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
SQL Injection 
 
Figure 8: Traffic Shield application firewall system defense list 
 
S3. Enhance website management security 
Different users should use different access domain name, 
strictly speaking, managers and general users should not 
use the same domain name. If we have one more 
protective strategy, it is difficult that an attacker steals the 
manager account. Sometimes managers use remote 
control to manage website, you should restrict the IP 
source if you really want do it. Besides, the logs on the 
website have detailed record of the actions of the 
attackers. We could have more clues to find the 
perpetrators of the incident. 
 
S4. Adopt secure sockets layer (SSL) using HTTPS 
protocol 
A Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is cryptographic protocol 
that provides authentication and encryption to 
communication on the internet. SSL is produced by 
Netscape, adopting RC4, MD5, and RSA encryption 
algorithm, etc. It was widely used in the World Wide 
Web. You can improve your e-business transaction 
security by installing SSL server certificate in the 
browser, because the transaction data between users and 
servers are all encrypted. Besides, HTTPS is to strengthen 
the HTTP protocol, it can enhance website security.  
 
4. Discussions  
Digital evidence is easy to destroy, easy to alter, and 
difficult to capture. If we would like to acquire digital 
evidence from computer crimes, a standard and forensic-
based procedure is required to involve the complete, 
effective, persuadable evidence inside the cyber-
investigations [1]. In this section we summarize the 
evidence acquisition and evidence examination to explore 
the whereabouts of XSS attacks referred to Sec. 3.1 with 
the three conditions, as shown in Table 2. We must collect 
victims, websites and attackers tripartite evidence. After 
collecting tripartite evidence, we use the time series 
analysis to link attacker invaded website and posted 
malicious code. This part can be analyzed from event 
logs. If we want to know when the victim browsed the 
website, we can compare with user’s browsing logs and 
website’s logs. In respect of the personal information 
which was stolen by attacker, we must investigate the 
attacker’s host. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have discussed new styles of XSS 
intrusion using HTTP and cross-platform properties to 
steal and abuse the user's personal information.Logs are 
very important in computer crime cases, many kinds of 
log records can find many evidence of crimes. 
Furthermore, it is not difficult to retain the logs. As long 
as familiar with the operation system and software, 
investigators can capture the log files. By analyzing 
various logs with time series analysis in computers, such 
as Web logs, FTP logs, browsing temporary and event 
logs, we can reconstruct the crime scenes and capture the 
suspect’s committed evidence. Finally, we offer some

Abstract
This paper describes the rapid multimedia encryp-
tion method (Fast Encryption Algorithm for Multime-
dia, FEA-M) and the evolutions of encryption, decryp-
tion structure. In present paper the method to analyze
and explain for the latest encryption laws has already
been advanced. This paper presents an improved way
to increase strength and toughness to improve the se-
curity of encryption to make it difficult to break
through such attacks. In addition, this paper will refer
to the background utilized by FEA-M over the years
and its attack methodologies and enhancements.
Key words: FEA-M, Boolean Matrix, XOR operator,
encryption, and decryption.
1. Introduction
Multimedia encryption method is very important
for Multimedia enterprises, as they are paying more
attention to the transmission of video information.
Video-information meeting is often happened in our
daily life, and it utilizes the network resources to trans-
mit the audio-visual materials. However, some people
are afraid that if other people receive the packages, it
may lead releasing important information. For example:
some enterprises do not hope that the secret content of
the video-information meeting be known by
competitive company. So we need to encrypt the mes-
sages before transmitting. Besides, ILOH¶V VL]Hmay be
very large and the multimedia of these audio files needs
for timely transmission, otherwise blanking may occur.
Therefore multimedia encryption method needs to en-
crypt fast and handle a large amount of information.
Although using encryption algorithms, such as DES,
AES encryption, can offer a high security, but it con-
sumes too many resources and is complex. So another
scheme, Fast Encryption Algorithm for Multimedia
(FEA-M), solves this problem. It handles 64-64 binary
square matrix a time, in order to develop quickly and
safely for a large data encryption.
FEA-M developed by former encrypts scheme [6]
[5], but it carries few weaknesses those were found by
other researchers [4]. So another scheme, improved
version of the FEA-M [3], is proposed. However, the
improved version of the FEA-M has been attacked by
other researchers [1]. In this paper, we proposed a new
version of FEA-M in order to provide more secure
structure.
This paper organizes as follows: The Section 2 in-
troduces the primitive FEA-M and cryptanalysis, and
we brief describe the improved FEA-M in Section 3.
Section 4 is aimed at our new proposed scheme and the
improvement. The security discussions are given in
Section 5. Finally, we conclude our work in Section 6.
2. Primitive FEA-M
Primitive FEA-M was proposed by Yi et al in
2001 [6], and it uses Boolean matrix (Boolean Matrix)
to encrypt the multimedia messages. The messages are
divided into many 64*64 blocks, and each block are
encrypted separately. We details are shown in follow:
2.1. Boolean Matrix
FEA-M multimedia encryption can deal with large
number of data processing and encrypt rapidly, because
X shall be solved and we get 0K . Then we substitute
back to the (6), and obtaine 0V . Finally we use 0V to
solve out the key K [4].
3. Improved FEA-M
3.1. Process of encryption and decryption
The different between the improved FEA-M [3]
and the primitive FEA-M [6] is that, the improved
FEA-M encrypts the matrix independently. Improved
FEA-M changes the iC into 0
iKV K and replaces iK
into n iK  . The details are shown in the following:
(i) Process of encryption
  11 1 0 0nC K P KV K K KV K  
 2 2 22 2 0 0nC K P KV K K KV K   «
 0 0i n i ii iC K P KV K K KV K   .
(ii) Process of decryption
   111 1 0 0nP K C KV K K KV K   
   21 2 22 2 0 0nP K C KV K K KV K    «
   1 0 0n ii ii iP K C KV K K KV K    .
3.2. The cryptanalysis
The detail is shown in [1][2]. In this method, the
first and foremost condition is that, two paragraphs
explicitly have same gap between adjacent block.
First, we choose iP and iPc to the same type of encryp-
tion as (9) (10)
 0 0i n i ii iC K P KV K K KV K   (9)
 0 0i n i ii iC K P KV K K KV Kc c   (10)
Then subtract (10) from (9)
   n i n ii i i i i iC C C K P P K K P K c c  '    ' (11)
Then we choose 1iP and
'
iP 1 to the same type of en-
cryption like (12) and (13)
 1 1 11 1 0 0i n i ii iC K P KV K K KV K       (12)
 1 1 11 1 0 0i n i ii iC K P KV K K KV K    c c   (13)
Then subtract (13) from (12)
  11 1 n ii iC K P K   '  ' (14)
We compare (11) and (14), and discover that, (11) and
(14) differ from K and iP' is also the same with 1iP' .
Thus, we can solve the K:
   11 1 1n i n ii i i iC K P K K P K K C K    '  '  '  '<
  1 1i iK C C  ' ' . (15)

Our new scheme is extended from improved FEA-
M. In order to prevent the cryptanalysis above, we
modify the original scheme as following:
(i) change the coefficient of P when same Pǻ oc-
cur, or
(ii) improve the power of K.
In the method (i), we can make iP' different from
1iP' by using preceding coefficient. In method (ii), we
change the power of K from i to i*(n+i), from iK to
 i n iK u  . It seems that if the power of K turns into
i*(n+i), the calculation complexity increase. It is not.
According to register application, every adjacent blocks
differ from the power of K, n+2i-1, and we firstly
store 1nK  in memory register, calculate 2 1 1nK  u  and
replace it to the register, and then calculate 2 2 1nK  u 
and replace it to the register. So on. It will not cause
much complexity in calculation. The followings are the
encryption and description.

(ii) Process of decryption
The first cipher text is deciphered by making ex-
clusion with 0KV K and the second cipher text
makes exclusion with 20KV K , and so on.
