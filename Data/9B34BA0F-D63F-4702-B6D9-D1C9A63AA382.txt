Abstract
With science and technology development, the world plastics production and consumption
have been increasing continuously in the recent twenty years. The Japanese trade magazine
“Plastics Age” survey reveals that about 65 milion tons of plastics were consumed in 1980 
while the consumption leaped to 185 million tons in 2000. It is expected to reach 295 million
tons in 2008. The plastic injection molding has become the most widely applied
mass-production technology, as it can shorten the finished product manufacturing cycle to raise
productivity with products of low plastics waste, high size precision and high quality stability in
addition to fully automated production. With respect to cost estimation, research and
development departments in the past could only estimate the final product total cost after getting
the quotations of the plastic injection parts after the design stage leading to development cost
estimation delay. Moreover, rules of thumb of the engineers are often applied as the cost
estimation benchmarks, making the results controversial in terms of accuracy. Although
calculation by cost model has the advantage of timeliness, only representative values exclusive
of indirect tasks cost and raw materials cost are calculated resulting in inadequate estimation
accuracy. Hence, the main purpose of this study is to design the cost estimation model for plastic
injection products in the design and development initial stage by the advantages of
back-propagation network (BPN), which belongs to monitoring style learning network of the neural
networks with advantages such as excellent diagnosis, prediction, simple theory, fast response and
high learning precision through the integration of 3D mode features data, price quotations and
purchase costs. Finally, the exemplifications demonstrated the effectiveness and performance of the
proposed approach.

3隨著產業競爭的日趨激烈，各家產品廠商無不突破地理疆界與既有組織的隔閡，全力
爭取客戶的訂單。因此，如何針對所設計產品上的塑膠射出零件單價能迅速評估，目的在
於開發階段就能掌握所開發產品的成本，以預期有多少利潤可參與價格競爭力，藉以穩固
企業在該產業中的利基與地位，就成為當前重要的課題。
2.2 在設計開發階段初期的成本預估
在微利時代的競爭下產品品質、具競爭性的成本與快速的交期是顧客所期望的，也是
企業積極在追求的目標方向。然而，在產品創新的分析與新產品的開發前端過程中，就能
要即時去處理產品品質等級、公差設計與產能等細部的生產成本規劃，企業就必須相當的
耗時的去評估，而所獲得的成本效應卻非常低，因為現在網際網路發達，顧客能方便的利
用 Email 針對多個廠商進行新產品的詢價的動作，再由眾多廠商所回覆的報價單中找出對
他最有利潤的產品單價，但往往他們最為關心的是誰的報價速度最快，誰的成本最低，至
於其他的卻不太去在乎，如產品客製化的程度、規格實測結果的數據或產品設計的複雜程
度。更糟的是廠商在估價時，卻忽略模組化設計、易製造性和生產排程的估算、夾治具開
發成本、產品後處理和最後包裝材料成本的考量。因此造成成本錯誤的估算，因此低估了
成本，造成利潤的流失，或估算太高導致顧客的信任喪失甚至失去市場佔有率的機會。
Cavalieria et al.（2004）在探討汽車產業中零件成本預估時，研究指出在產品生命週期
的最後階段，大部分的產品成本持續在產生，這是因為在產品概念設計階段時就被決定
了，Yang et al.（1997）、Rehman et al.（1998）、Gayretli et al.（1999）也相繼研究提出在
產品設計初期階段，就決定了產品總成本的 70-80%，因此成本預估是非常重要的，如圖 2
顯示產品設計各階段所能控制降低成本的潛能，例如設計與規劃階段僅占產品成本的 7%
但是卻具有降低 65%成本的潛能。

2.3 產業界塑膠射出成本估算法則
由於參數特徵式繪圖軟體廣泛的被研發單位使用，如 Pro/Engineer 或 SolidWorks 等軟
體，因此塑膠射出成形產品在設計階段均採用其繪圖軟體設計特徵幾何後，再將圖檔交由
射出成形廠依其模具的大小、產品的材質、成形的時間及射出機台噸數的選擇後進行估
價，其產品參數式成本估算方式詳述如下（Yen，1996）：
（1） 單一成形品之價格分析步驟
每一成形品在生產之前，研發單位應先做圖面研討，評估產品易製造性(Design for
Manufacture，DFM)，經由模具廠設計模具後，決定最適當的生產模穴數。其次射出成形
廠計算成形品的淨重及澆道重量，以便計算材料費。再依成形品、模具選定適當的成形機，
計算成形加工費、整修費、二次加工及製造成本，最後決定理想價格。塑膠射出廠之塑膠

本研究對於塑膠射出產品之成本預估，可依據塑膠射出產品設計規格中影響成本較大
的因素，以運用其理論簡明、回想速度快、學習精度高等優點建立一倒傳遞類神經網路為
模式的成本預估方式，如圖 5 所示。藉由建立網路所需之輸入與輸出變數，加上對類神經
網路的訓練與調整，以達成快速估算塑膠射出產品報價的目標。
先蒐集的塑膠射出成形件報價資料建立樣本以供網路學習及測試，已確認倒傳遞網路
用於報價估算的可行性；待確認可行性後，再將訓練完成之網路權重值輸出至本研究建置
之系統程式中，藉以估算所設計 3D 模型特徵所對應的報價。詳細的研究流程如圖 6 所示。

6terms of cost, the purchase cost accounts for 60% of the total cost. Hence,
considerations of full scale factors shall be taken in selecting the supplier to find out
the optimized one by multi-aspect evaluation.
With the rising of the environmental protection awareness, the materials needed by
products to be sold in European countries must comply with the directives of WEEE
and RoHS. Hence, this study will take the directives of WEEE and RoHS as appraisal
factors in supply chain partner selection. The two directives, together with cost,
quality, delivery time, and production capacity will serve as the basic conditions for
supply chain partner selection.
This study is mainly aimed at in-depth discussion of hierarchical supply chain
network system, expecting to construct the most appropriate supply chain system and
production distribution decision-making model. As the supply chain system partner
appraisal is a very important procedure, this study proposes a systematic method to
construct the partner appraisal model. Effectively satisfying the customers’ demands,
we plan out the most appropriate supply chain system and production decision to
assist the decision-making personnel to get rapidly and effectively the
decision-making schemes appraisal results.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
The green supply chain, in broad sense, refers to the requirements of supplier,
products and environmental protection management, namely, the incorporation of
environmental protection principles in supplier management mechanism. It aims to
empower the products with concepts of environmental protection to raise market
competitiveness. Whereas, the currently known green supply chain refers to the
supply chain effects of green products promoted by European Union when we enter
into 21st century. The developed nations of European Union, who have realized the
intertwined interests in supply chain, actively made legislations for some
environmental protection issues by bypassing moral persuasion. And they have planed
out the schedule for implementing WEEE and RoHS, expecting to bring the world
manufacture industry into a new more environmentally-friendly era by relying on the
huge commercial market of European Union. Sarkis (2003) proposed a strategy
decision to make structure to assist the management in making decisions. In this
article, the green supply chain management elements and the way of these elements
serving as the basic conditions for the decision making structure were stressed and
discussed. And the decision-making structure mainly includes 5 strategies: product
life cycle strategy, operational life cycle, environmental effects on the organizational
implementation strategy, the organizational efficiency demands and the green supply
chain scheme.
With the rising of environmental protection awareness, governments begin to force
many companies to improve their environmental practices. In response to the
concerns of the green topics, in the past ten more years, many companies have started
to implement a series of environmental planning, which mainly falls into three types:
Type 1, the main purpose of the company management was to reduce the air pollution,
solid wastes, the waste water and energy consumption of the factories (Hunt and
Auster,1990) ; Type 2, after entering into 1980s, companies started to promote the use
of clean technologies in the manufacturing process (Porter and van der Linde,1995);
Type 3, since 1990, companies started to change operational procedures and to
promote environmental inspection structure to modify products and services. At
present, we are entering into the fourth stage where many companies start to set up
green plans aimimg at organizing their supply chains from the perspective of

6. CASE STUDY
This study uses a 2-3-3-2 supply chain structure to illustrate the concept of the whole
system. As shown in Fig. 2, partners of various stages have different unit
manufacturing cost, unit transportation cost, minimum production capacity, and
maximum production capacity. This structure takes consideration of only one single
product, which is manufactured by the supply chain structure and distributed to
different partners to reach the goal of minimum cost and meet the final requirements
by different quantity combinations. Parts of data after T transformation are shown in

In designing the experiment, we implement different experimental combinations by
using groups of particles parameters: generation 40 and generation 50, particle
number of 50 and 60, inertia weight of 0.4 and 0.5, and maximum velocity of 6 and 10.
It can be known from the experiment results that the minimum fitness function value
is 50540.14. All the experimental results are shown in Table 2. By comparing the
results, we can find that combination (i) in Table 2 costs minimum time and get the
convergence and the optimized parameters combination is generation 50, number of
particles of 50, inertia weight of 0.4 and maximum velocity of 6. Fig. 3 shows the

In order to verify the feasibility of the particle swarm algorithm proposed in this study,
this study compares the optimized solution with the solution got from the linear
planning. The object function value obtained from linear planning is 50540.14, taking
only1 second. This study adopts the equations (15) and (16) by Wang and Che (2007)
to calculate APDF and APDT, and employs T test to test the object function values and
computation time. The results are shown in Table 3.

As seen from Table 3, the optimized fitness by using this method is as good as the one
obtained from linear planning. However, it takes more time than LP. APDF value is 0,
APDT value is 1.9063. The average solution finding time varies less than 2 seconds.
Although, the solution-finding model is not as fast as the linear programming model
in terms of velocity, when the supply chain network structure is more complex with
more factors being considered (for example, production loss), the simple LP cannot
complete the supply chain planning. Therefore, the particle swarm algorithm solution
finding model has its feasibility in certain circumstances.

The main purpose of this article is to provide a particle swarm solution-finding model
for decision-makers to find out green partners quickly. The decision-making model
cannot only determine the most appropriate partner combinations as well as
