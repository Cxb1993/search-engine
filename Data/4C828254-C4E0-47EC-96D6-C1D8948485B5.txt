Abstract
The purpose ofTaiwan Science Citation Index (TSCI) system is to design one
Taiwan journal citation database platform which can be used to query, study and
evaluate scientific research. This article describes the design, architecture,
feature, policy, rule, system and application of TSCI journal database. Both
citation analysis and bibliometrics had been thought as the mainstream methodology
to study academic researchdevelopment and trend in the past. These methodologies
would be used to design andimplement TSCI platform. The scientific journals indexed
by Science Citation Index (SCI) are most published byEnglish language. TSCI indexes
Taiwan scientific journals published bytraditionalChinese language. Therefore,
TSCI journal database can provide scholars more resources to study the scientific
research activities in Taiwan.

source. For the TSCI policy and principle, they would be described as the following:
2.2 TSCI Policy
   In this project, we made some policies to guide our directions. That is because the journals
which were published in Taiwan have many different formats. Most of journals accept different
languages’ manuscripts including traditional Chinese language and English language. The
metadata of each article have both Chinese and English versions too. In order to make the TSCI
database consistency, we try to define some TSCI policies as following:
1. The collected journal must belong to the science field.
2. The society or publisher for collected journal must be located at Taiwan.
3. The references for each article are limited to journal, textbook and magazine.
4. The metadata of each article including in title, keyword, author name, address, journal name,
volume, issue, page and reference would be indexed under Taiwan’s copyright law.
2.3 TSCI Principle
  As for the TSCI principle, we refer to related works and define our TSCI principle as follows.
However, the principles may be modified, added and changed when we find that it is necessary to
do so.
A. The Disciplinary
Multi-disciplinary were classified into Science field. They are life science, medicine,
mechanical engineering, mathematics, earth science, physical science, chemistry, computer
science and civil engineering (Table 1). If the journal belongs to one of above disciplinary, it
would be classified into the Science field. Therefore, TSCI journal source would come from these
disciplinary.
Table 1. The Disciplinary Category
Fields Disciplinary
Science 1. Life Science
2. Medicine
3. Mech. Engineering
4. Mathematics
5. Earth Science
6. Physical Science
7. Chemistry
8. Computer Science
9. Civil Engineering
Social Science N/A
Art and Humanities N/A
B. The MetaData of Journal Article Source
  Many metadata formats of journal article source exist in many journals. In order to make
output consistency, the united format in the TSCI platform would be as the following:
1. Title
  1.1 The journal full name would be used rather than the abbreviation name. The journal name
Textbook Yes
Dissertation Consider
Conference Consider
Website No
Patent No
Technique Report No
2) The Reference Format
  There are also many different formats in the references of journal article. The processes for
these formats in TSCI platform are also very similar with the solutions and the consistent format
which we process the metadata of journal article source.
1. Title
  1.1 The journal full name would be used rather than the abbreviation name. The journal name
could be changed after a period of time. In TSCI database, we would renew and unify journal
name each year. The purpose of this is to make data consistency and accuracy in the TSCI
database and journal citation report.
  1.2 Both Chinese and English references and titles would be collected. If reference was written
in English and author did not provide Chinese references, we would collect English references
only.
  1.3 Simplified Chinese article would be filtered because we focus on the journal published in
Taiwan.
2. Author
  2.1 The author name begins with Last name. As for the name sequence, the first is Last name
and the second is Middle name. Third, First name would be the last one and behind the Middle
name. And all the names would be in the upper case. The second and first name would be
replaced with single one character. This format is used by Thomson ISI Inc. (2007) now. As the
result, different format of author name would be transformed to this consistent format.
  2.2 If author name is unavailable, the translator name or organization would be added to
database in the field of author.
3. Date
  We would only collect the publication year. The date property in references is not like the date
format in the front page of each paper. We cannot get the detail information such as submit date
and accept date. The website reference may have last access or available date. But we don’t
process website references currently.
4. Page
  The page format would be defined as the following example: pp11-23. Different formats from
various sources would be transformed to this format.
5. The Indexing Reference Type
There are many reference content types including original paper, review paper, editorial, letter,
comment, news, magazine, textbook, dissertation, website, patent and so on. Currently, we only
handle the reference type of peer-reviewed paper and textbook. The references which do not
belong to original article, review paper or textbook would be filtered.
frequency, the rank of a word on that list multiplied by its frequency will equal a constant. The
equation for this relationship is: r x f = k where r is the rank of the word, f is the frequency, and k
is the constant. Zipf illustrated his law with an analysis of James Joyce's Ulysses. "He showed
that the tenth most frequent word occurred 2,653 times, the hundredth most frequent word
occurred 265 times, the two hundredth word occurred 133 times, and so on. Zipf found, then that
the rank of the word multiplied by the frequency of the word equals a constant that is
approximately 26,500". Zipf's Law, again, is not statistically perfect, but it is very useful for
indexers.
2. Citation Analysis
Another major area of bibliometric research uses various methods of citation analysis in order
to establish relationships between authors or their publications. Here is a definition of citation
analysis, and definitions of co-citation coupling and bibliographic coupling, which are specific
kinds of citation analysis (Bibliometrics, 2007).
A) Citation Analysis
When one author cites another author, a relationship is established. Citation analysis uses
citations in scholarly works to establish links. Many different links can be ascertained, such as
links between authors, between scholarly works, between journals, between fields, or even
between countries. Citations both from and to a certain document may be studied. One very
common use of citation analysis is to determine the impact of a single author on a given field by
counting the number of times the author has been cited by others. One possible drawback of this
approach is that authors may be citing the single author in a negative context.
B) Co-citation Coupling
Co-citation coupling is a method used to establish a subject similarity between two documents.
If papers A and B are both cited by paper C, they may be said to be related to one another, even
though they don't directly cite each other. If papers A and B are both cited by many other papers,
they have a stronger relationship. The more papers they are cited by, the stronger their
relationship is.
C) Bibliographic Coupling
Bibliographic coupling operates on a similar principle, but in a way it is the mirror image of
co-citation coupling. Bibliographic coupling links two papers that cite the same articles, so that if
papers A and B both cite paper C, they may be said to be related, even though they don't directly
cite each other. The more papers they both cite, the stronger their relationship is.
3.2 TSCI Database Design
Figure 1 is the Entity-Relationship model of TSCI database. There are several entities
including journal, article, author analysis, unit analysis, country analysis and category analysis.
The schema for each entity is illustrated as the following table. Table 3 lists the journal entity
attributes and Table 4 lists the article entity attributes. Both tables are designed to store the raw
data of journal and article in the TSCI database. Table 5 is the article citation entity table. Each
journal has its own citing journal and cited journal. Every article has its own citing references and
cited references. Table 6 is the journal citation report entity table. Citing reference can be seen as
the input of article’s citation and Cited reference can be seen as the output of article’s citation. In
order to do further value-added analysis, the meta data of author analysis, unit analysis, country
analysis and category analysis (Table 7-10) are designed to provide required fields to store

3.3 TSCI System Design
The TSCI system platform is constructed via Microsoft Asp.Net and SQL Server 2005 on the
Windows 2003 Server platform. The TSCI system platform is divided into three major
sub-systems. They are journal indexing system, journal analysis system and journal citation
system. The system architecture was illustrated as Figure 2 and Table 11.
advanced search, we provide richer search properties from journal, author and article database
tables.
2) Journal Analysis System
In the journal analysis system, we design the offline analysis mode. There are four analysis
sub-modules in journal analysis system. They are author analysis sub-modules (AAS), unit
analysis sub-modules (UAS), country analysis sub-modules (CAS) and source title analysis
sub-modules (STAS). For this the offline mode, TSCI platform would generate analysis reports
based on its own classification policy and then adjust report by human being. These reports could
become the electronic academic activity analysis reports.
Some other impact factors can be calculated via this system too. Three different kinds of
value-added impact factors, including author impact factor (AIF), unit impact factor (UIF) and
country impact factor (CIF), which can be calculated and extended from the raw data in the TSCI
database. In Formula 3.1, which is the AIF calculation, F represents journal impact factor (JIF);
M represents author member numbers; T represents article types including News, Review, Letter
and Editorial Paper; and W represents the weight of article type. In Formulas 3.2 and 3.3, A
represents author impact factor. U represents unit impact factor. Owing to the hierarchical and
aggregate relationship among country, unit and author, we can firstly calculate AIF. Then UIF can
be further obtained from AIF, and CIF can be further calculated from UIF recursively.

3) Journal Citation System
  There are two sub-modules in the journal citation system. They are Journal Searching System
(JSS) and Journal Citation Report System (JCRS). In the journal searching system, we would
provide much more advanced searching features such as cited and citing reference search. The
journal citation report (JCR) in journal citation report system (JCRS) is the one of the most highly
valued target in the TSCI platform. That is because JCR can be used to evaluate the impact factor
of scientific journal published in Taiwan.
Due to the bi-directional citations between journals, we call this journal cited analysis and
journal citing analysis. Similarly, it could be called journal linking in/out analysis. Four related
factors would be used in this research: the JCDF (Journal Cited Factor), SJCDF (Subtract
Self-Journal Cited Factor), JCIF (Journal Citing Factor) and SJCIF (Subtract Journal Citing
Factor). In the kJCDF (Formula 3.4), DFj is the abbreviation for Cited-Frequency, which counts
the base journal’s cited frequency (link-in) from “n” kinds of journals. In the citation matrix as in
Table 12, DFj is the cited counts in the horizontal direction. kDA  is abbreviated from
Cited-Articles, which represents the amounts of articles published by the base journal. And, “k” is
the target journal, whose citation factor is being calculated. “n” is the total number of journals.
“j” is the base journal index (j=1,…,n). While the kSJCDF  (Formula 3.5) is being calculated,
In the table 13, we show the journal impact factor for those highly cited journals published
in Taiwan. The time span is from 2002 to 2004.The journal impact factor was calculated as above
formula which was proposed by Thomson ISI Inc. The JIF-Remove-SC means that the journal
impact factor was calculated after we remove the journal self citation. The articles in one journal
often cite the articles published in the same journal. It will cause the bios to calculate journal
impact factor. Therefore, the self-cited counts was deducted in this study in order to avoid this
bios.
Most highly cited journals are from the medical field. That is because Taiwan has many
medical journals. There are fewer engineering journals in Taiwan. Therefore, some famous
journals such as “Journal of Information Science and Engineering” which is a SCI journal was
poorly cited in TSCI database. The amount of relevant journals is one of the important variables
to influence the cited counts and journal impact factor.
