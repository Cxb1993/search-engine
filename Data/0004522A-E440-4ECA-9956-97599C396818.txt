Abstract 
 
Keywords: Phosphor, white-light light-emitting diode, surface plasmon, polarized light-emitting 
diode 
 
Phosphor-free monolithic InGaN-based white-light light-emitting diode (LED) has the 
advantages of simpler device process and potentially higher efficiency. Several techniques have 
been developed for implementing such white-light LEDs. Among them, the key issue is the growth 
of a high-quality high-indium InGaN/GaN quantum well (QW). An underlying-InGaN-layer growth 
technique is introduced for enhancing the crystal quality of a high-indium QW. To demonstrate the 
superior properties of a QW grown with this technique, a green LED is fabricated based on the 
underlying growth technique to compare with another LED of the same emission wavelength based 
on the conventional growth method. Then, the underlying growth technique is used to grow three 
yellow-emitting QWs of high efficiency. The yellow photons mix with blue light from an 
overgrown blue-emitting QW to produce white light. The improved properties of the phosphor-free 
monolithic white-light LED are discussed in details. 
The variation behaviors of the output intensity and polarization ratio of InGaN/GaN quantum 
well (QW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with surface plasmon (SP) coupling by inserting SiO2 
intermediate layers between the p-GaN layers and surface Ag grating structures are demonstrated. 
The insertion of the SiO2 layer is expected to reduce the metal dissipation of SP energy and extend 
the near-field distribution range of the induced SP for generating more favored SP-QW coupling 
effects. The Ag grating period for optimizing SP-QW coupling is increased when a SiO2 layer is 
added to the device, which is consistent with the simulation results of the momentum matching of 
surface plasmon polariton and the resonance behavior of localized surface plasmon. The almost 
un-polarized outputs from other LED samples fabricated with an epitaxial structure of thicker 
p-GaN layer, which leads to weak SP-QW coupling, indicate that the observed polarization ratios 
are due to near-field SP-QW coupling, instead of far-field diffraction.

visible range [11,12]. By controlling the indium composition and cluster size, such 
quantum-dot-like structures can result in emission up to the red range. The long-wavelength 
emission from the localized states and the short-wavelength emission from the free-carrier states, 
which exist in the low-indium regions, mix to produce white light. In such an implementation, as 
injection current level was increased to fill up the localized states, which emitted yellow light, 
carriers in the free-carrier states led to blue emission for mixing into white light [13]. For effective 
short-wavelength emission, an alternative approach was proposed to grow a few blue-emitting QWs 
in addition to a phase-separated InGaN layer [14]. The The green/amber emissions from the 
phase-separated layer mixed with the blue light for realizing white light. It was also reported that 
adding an InGaN wetting layer before the growth of the high-indium QW, the indium incorporation 
could be enhanced such that indium-rich quantum-dot-like structures could be easily formed [15]. 
An alternative approach for fabricating phosphor-free monolithic white-light LED is to grow 
InGaN/GaN QWs on a non-c-plane facet or multiple facets. It has been shown that by depositing an 
InGaN/GaN QW on the {11-22} facet of a triangular overgrown body, which was formed during the 
early stage of epitaxially laterally overgrowth from a stripe window [16]. Because the QW width 
changed continuously along the facet, the local emission wavelengths were different at different 
facet positions such that a broad spectrum covering almost the whole visible range could be 
observed. By controlling the overgrowth time and the window width, three facets of (0001), (11-22), 
and (11-20) planes of different sizes could be formed on the overgrown body. When a QW was 
deposited on the overgrown body, the indium incorporation on the (0001) facet was the highest, 
followed by that on the (11-22) facet and then that on the (11-20) facet, such that blue, green, and 
nearly-red lights were emitted from the (11-20), (11-22), and (0001) facets, respectively [17]. With 
different relative facet sizes, the relative intensities of the three primary colors could be modulated. 
By alternatively arranging two overgrown bodies of different relative facet sizes, pulsed excitations 
of different duty cycles, but with constant average injection current, led to almost the same LED 
output intensity, but different mixed colors [18]. 
Regrowth is an effective approach for combining epitaxial structures of different emission 
wavelengths to mix into white light. A blue/green two-wavelength LED was fabricated by first 
etching part of a blue-emitting QW structure in the lateral dimension and then regrowing a 
green-emitting QW structure to fill into the etched regions [19]. The parallel carrier injection into 
the QW structures of the two wavelengths in this LED resulted in a stable emission color at high 
injection currents. In another example of lateral overgrowth, n-type GaN for n-contact beside the 
p-contact on the top of an epitaxial structure containing blue and green-emitting QWs were regrown 
for lateral current flow [20]. It was claimed that with lateral current flow, the variations of the 
relative intensities of the two colors in changing injection current could be minimized. 
The other effective approach for combining the epitaxial structures of different emission 
colors is wafer bonding. A device of bonding a blue LED on the p-type side after laser-lifting its 
sapphire substrate with a green LED has been published [21]. Also, wafer bonding an InGaN-based 
blue LED with an AlGaInP-based red LED to form a white-light device was reported [22]. Its CIE 
chromaticity coordinates at the injection current of 20 mA was close to (0.3, 0.3). 
The most direct method for polychromatic emission is the monolithic growth of 
multi-parameters QWs. Because of the strong QCSE in an InGaN/GaN QW of high-indium content, 
at least two parameters can be used for controlling the emission wavelength of a QW, including 
indium content and QW width. Monolithic white-light LED based on InGaN/GaN QWs of different 
QW widths [23] and different indium contents [24] were reported quite early. The mixed growth of 
blue and green (or yellow) emitting QWs for generating nearly-white light has been widely 
implemented [20,25,26]. Because of the much lower migration speed of hole, when compared with 
that of electron, in nitride compounds, the growth order of QWs of different parameters has been 
well designed for controlling the relative intensities of different colors. In most implementations, 
both blue and green (or yellow) QWs were excited by injection current. However, an LED 
implementation with active blue QW and passive yellow QW was also reported [27]. In this device, 
the yellow QW absorbed blue photons from the electrically pumped blue QW and reemitted yellow

4. Sample Structures and Growth Conditions 
 
A. Green LEDs Based on the Underlying and Conventional Growths 
 
The two green-emitting LED samples for comparison were grown on c-plane sapphire substrate 
with metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Their structures are depicted in Figs. 1(a) and (b). 
Among them, sample A (see Fig. 1(a)) represents a standard green LED structure. In preparing this 
sample, after the growth of a 30-nm GaN buffer layer (grown at 535 oC), a 3-m n-GaN layer was 
grown at 1080 oC before the deposition of two periods of InGaN/GaN QW (3-nm in well thickness 
grown at 675 oC, 12-nm in barrier thickness grown at 900 oC). To complete the LED epitaxial 
structure, a 30-nm p-Al0.2Ga0.8N layer and then a 120-nm p-GaN layer were deposited on the top at 
the temperature of 945 oC. In the underlying-growth sample (sample B, see Fig. 1(b)), an 
InGaN/GaN QW of ~7 % in indium content (3-nm well layer grown at 760 oC) was added before 
growing the 12-nm GaN bottom barrier of the first high-indium QW for creating the prestrain effect. 
With the prestrain effect, if the growth temperature of the QWs was kept at 675 oC, the QW 
emission wavelength was shifted into the yellow range. To maintain the same emission wavelength 
as that of sample A in the green range, the QW growth temperature was raised from 675 to 705 oC 
for growing sample B. Except the growth temperature of the high-indium QWs, all other growth 
conditions of sample B are the same as those of sample A. Based on the measurement and 
calibration of X-ray diffraction, the indium contents of the two QWs in sample A are 16.4 and 16.3 
% (from the top). Those of the three QWs in sample B are 16.7, 16.8, and 6.3 %. The 6.3 % for the 
low-indium QW to create the underlying-growth effect is quite close to the designated 7 % level. 
The two green LED samples were fabricated following the standard procedure. The 
square-mesa-geometry (300 m x 400 m) devices were defined using photo- lithography and 
inductively coupled plasma dry etching. Then, electron- beam evaporation was used to deposit 
p-type Ohmic contacts consisting of Ni (150nm)/Au (150nm) after the growth of a current 
spreading layer of Ni (5nm)/Au (5nm). The devices were then annealed in nitrogen ambient for 5 
min at 600 °C. Finally, the n-type Ohmic contacts, consisting of Ti (20nm)/Al (120nm)/Ni 
(150nm)/Au (150nm) were deposited by electron- beam evaporation and annealed in nitrogen 
ambient for 5 min at 450 °C to complete the process procedures. 
 
 
B. White-light LED 
 
To demonstrate the implementation of a monolithic white-light LED, a blue/yellow two-wavelength 
LED structure is grown and designated as sample C (see Fig. 1(c) for the device structure). First, a 
30-nm GaN nucleation layer was grown on (0001) c-plane sapphire substrate at 535 oC. Then, after 
the growth of a 3-m n-GaN at 1080 oC, a low-indium InGaN of 3 nm in width was grown at 750 
oC to generate the underlying-layer effect, followed by the deposition of a 12-nm GaN barrier layer 
(grown at 870 oC), before the growth of three high-indium QWs. In growing each high-indium QW, 
after the growth of a 3-nm InGaN QW layer at 670 oC, the growth temperature was ramped to 870 
oC within one minute for depositing GaN barrier of 15 nm in thickness. Abrupt interfaces between 
the wells and barriers can be achieved using this method of fast growth-temperature ramp. Such an 
abrupt interface can enhance the quantum confinement of carriers resulting in higher efficiency. 
After the growth of the three high-indium QWs (expected to be yellow emitting), a blue-emitting 
QW with the well layer grown at 740 oC was added at the top of the QW sequence. Finally, a 30-nm 
p-Al0.2Ga0.8N layer, followed by a 120-nm p-GaN layer (both grown at 945 oC), was deposited. The 
LED fabrication follows the standard procedures as described in subsection A above.

Figure 3 shows the normalized integrated PL intensities as functions of temperature of the two 
samples. The ratio of such intensity at 300 K over that at 10 K is usually regarded as the internal 
quantum efficiency (IQE) even though it may not be very accurate [39,40]. A comparison between 
the two samples shows that the IQE of sample B (13.4 %) is significantly higher than that of sample 
A (5.7 %), implying that the optical quality is better in sample B. Figure 4 shows the LED output 
intensities (the right ordinate) of the two samples indicating the higher emission efficiency of LED 
sample B. At 120 mA in injection current, the LED output intensity is enhanced by ~56 % through 
the underlying-growth effect. In Fig. 4, we also show the variations of current versus applied 
voltage (I-V curves) of the two samples. One can see that although the turn-on voltage of sample B 
is slightly higher than that of sample A (both around 3 V), the device resistance of the 
underlying-growth sample is lower than that of the control sample. The device resistance values of 
samples A and B are 101.7 and 70.2 , respectively.

Fig. 3 Normalized integrated PL intensities as functions of temperature of samples A and B. The 
ratios of the integrated intensity at 300 K over that at 10 K, which are usually called IQEs, are 
shown in the figure. 
  
Figure 5 shows the QW carrier density dependent spectral behaviors of the two samples. Here, 
the PL CoM wavelengths blue shift with increasing pump power from 3 through 15 mW. Also, the 
EL spectral peak wavelengths blue shift with increasing injection current from 10 through 60 mA. 
The PL (EL) spectral shift ranges of samples A and B are 3.38 and 2.07 nm (8.46 and 1.97 nm), 
respectively. Either the PL or EL spectral blue-shift range in increasing the supplied carrier density 
corresponds to the strength of the QCSE in a QW. One can see that with underlying growth, the 
QCSE has been significantly suppressed. From the results above, one can see that the green LED 
based on underlying growth has superior properties than the control sample, including the 
enhancement of emission efficiency and the reduction of QCSE. It is noted that when we increase 
injection current level, QCSE screening leads to spectral blue shift and device heating results in 
spectral red shift. However, normally the QCSE screening effect dominates. Since the device 
resistance of sample A (101.7 ) is larger than that of sample B (70.2 ), we might expect that the 
 10
is relatively smaller. 
Figure 9 shows the I-V curve of the fabricated white-light LED. The turn-on voltage of the LED 
is around 4 V, slightly higher than that of an ordinary blue LED. The device resistance is estimated 
to be 70.3 . The insert of Fig. 9 shows the picture of the LED when it was lit with 20 mA in 
injection current. The emission is quite uniform over the mesa. Figure 10 shows the CIE 
coordinates of the white light output at various injection current levels. At each point of a particular 
injection current level, the color temperature is also indicated. One can see that as the injection 
current increases from 10 through 60 mA, the CIE coordinates move from (0.284, 0.337) to (0.315, 
0.412). Meanwhile, the color temperature decreases from 8037 to 6062 K. The variations of CIE 
coordinates are also shown in the CIE diagram in the insert of Fig. 10. One can see that the 
coordinates are essentially located in the white region.

distribution is extended further into the semiconductor. Theoretical calculation has demonstrated 
these behaviors [20]. Although in such a structure with an intermediate dielectric layer, the SPP 
density of state can be reduced, the overall SP-QW coupling-assisted emission efficiency can be 
enhanced because of the reduction of metal dissipation. Based on photoluminescence measurement, 
emission enhancement from such a structure has been demonstrated [20]. However, so far, LED 
implementation with an intermediate dielectric layer has not yet been reported. 
Because of its electromagnetic nature, an SP mode is polarized [11,21]. Therefore, if a 
one-dimensional (1-D) metal grating structure is fabricated on the LED top to produce a dominating 
SP mode of effective radiation in SP-QW coupling, the emitted polarization of this SP-coupled LED 
is expected to be dominated by the SP polarization. Since the SP-QW coupling mechanism can 
transfer carrier energy of an unpolarized nature into SP for polarized emission, the polarized output 
is intrinsically generated. Therefore, the SP-QW coupling mechanism with a 1-D metal grating 
structure for SP generation is useful for producing intrinsically polarized output of an LED [22]. In 
this part of report, we report the study results of combining such a 1-D metal grating with the 
aforementioned intermediate dielectric layer (SiO2) between metal and semiconductor for producing 
the SP-QW coupling effects of higher strength and lower loss, thereby also increasing the output 
polarization effect in an InGaN/GaN QW LED. Various LED samples of changing Ag grating 
period with and without the intermediate SiO2 layer are fabricated and compared to see the output 
polarization variations. Numerical simulations are performed to understand the SP modes 
responsible for the SP-QW coupling and polarized output generation. In section 2 of this paper, the 
LED epitaxial structure and device fabrication procedure are presented. In section 3, the 
characterization results of the LED samples are reported. The numerical simulation results are given

The LED epitaxial structures include a 2-m n-GaN layer, five InGaN/GaN QWs (emission at ~500 
nm), a 15-nm AlGaN current-blocking layer, and a p-GaN layer on the top. Two epitaxial structures 
are prepared by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition with the p-GaN layers at 60 (thin) and 120 
(thick) nm. In fabricating an LED of SP-QW coupling, on the mesa of 300 m x 300 m, a central 
square region of 200 m x 200 m is used for depositing a SiO2 layer of 30 nm in thickness (see 
Fig. 1). The area outside this square region is covered by Ni/Au of 5nm/5nm in thickness for current 
spreading. Within the SiO2 region, a central square area of 180 m x 180 m is used for fabricating 
Ag gratings of 30 nm in metal height and of various periods, ranging from 250 through 600 nm with 
the step size of 50 nm, on the SiO2 layer. The duty cycle of the fabricated Ag gratings is fixed at 50 
%. In Fig. 1, the coordinate system is defined showing that the Ag grating grooves are along the x 
axis. To further demonstrate the Ag grating structure, a side-view drawing of the LED near the top 
is shown in Fig. 2(a). Here, one can see that the Ag stripes of the grating are isolated from each 
other. In Fig. 2(a), the polar angle  is defined. The Ag grating structures are fabricated with the 
electron-beam lithography and a liftoff process. The LED samples covered by the SiO2 layer and Ag 
gratings are designated as samples A(d) (A’(d)) with d representing the grating period number (in 
nm) when the epitaxial structure of thin (thick) p-GaN layer is used. Those covered by Ag gratings 
only (without the SiO2 layer) are designated as samples B(d) and B’(d) when the epitaxial structure 
of thin and thick p-GaN layer are used, respectively. Then, the LED samples covered only by SiO2 
layers (without an Ag grating) are designated as samples C and C’ when the epitaxial structure of 
thin and thick p-GaN layer are used, respectively. Finally, those LEDs without a SiO2 layer and an 
Ag grating are assigned as samples D and D’ when the epitaxial structure of thin and thick p-GaN 
layer are used, respectively. It is noted that because the epitaxial structure on a two-inch wafer can 
be non-uniform, all the LED samples were fabricated in the regions of the same wafer radius in 
order to minimize its effects on LED behavior. Also, for each grating period, a set of samples A-D is 
fabricated in nearby regions on the epitaxial wafer such that the performances of these samples can 
 18
study. Because of the used 1-D grating structure, our 2-D simulation study should lead to reasonable 
results for understanding the SP-QW coupling behaviors in the fabricated LED samples. The 
dielectric constant of Ag is obtained from literature [23]. The refractive indices of SiO2 and GaN are 
assumed to be 1.5 and 2.5, respectively.

intermediate layer. 
 
 
3. Characteristics of Light-emitting Diodes 
 
Figure 3 shows the variations of emission intensity in the z and –z directions with injection current 
of several samples fabricated with the epitaxial structure of thin p-GaN. Samples A(550) and B(500) 
are chosen for comparison in Fig. 3 because the grating period of 550 (500) nm leads to the 
maximum emission intensities in the z and -z directions among sample A (B) series, which will be 
demonstrated in Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 3, by adding the SiO2 layer only (sample C), the intensity 
of the emission in the –z direction (labeled by -(-z), with the right ordinate) is slightly enhanced due 
to light extraction enhancement (refractive index matching and slightly rougher SiO2 surface) when 
compared with the reference sample (D). Also, without the SiO2 layer, the fabrication of Ag gratings 
on the p-GaN layer (sample B series) results in a more significant increase of LED emission. At the 
injection current of 60 mA, the emission intensity of sample B(500) in the -z direction increases by 
20 %, when compared with sample D. Then, by fabricating Ag gratings on the deposited SiO2 layer 
(sample A series), the emission intensity of sample A(550) in the -z direction is significantly 
enhanced when compared with sample B(500) (increased by 45 % when compared with sample D). 
On the other hand, for the emission in the z direction (labeled by -(z)), the intensities of samples C 
and D are comparable. However, although by adding the Ag grating structure in sample B(500) the 
emission intensity in the z direction is slightly increased, it is reduced in sample A (550). The 
summations (labeled by -(t)) of the emission intensities in the z and -z directions are also shown in 
Fig. 3 to illustrate the emission enhancement by fabricating the Ag gratings on the device top. 
Although the emissions in the z and -z directions do not represent the total emission of an LED, 
they correspond to the strongest LED output components on the top and bottom sides, respectively. 
Therefore, their behaviors should reflect the total output power variation trends among the 
fabricated LED samples.

 Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the angle-dependent emission intensity variations of the two 
polarization components of LED sample A(550) in the y-z and x-z planes, respectively, when the 
injection current is 50 mA. Here,  = 0 and 180 degreescorrespond to the directions in the z and -z 
axes. In both Fig. 6(a) and Fig. 6(b), the curves of the p- (in the scanning plane) and s-polarized 
(perpendicular to the scanning plane) components and their summation (t) are plotted. In the y-z 
plane, the s polarization is the same as the x polarization. In Fig. 6(a), the y-polarized component is 
also plotted by multiplying the p-polarized component by the square of cos. In Fig. 6(b), in the x-z 
plane, the s polarization is the same as the y polarization. Here, the x-polarized component is also 
plotted by multiplying the p-polarized component by the square of cos. In both Fig. 6(a) and 6(b), 
the bottom emission is generally stronger than the top emission. The rougher distribution of 
emission intensity on the top side can be due to the more complicated surface structure of the device 
on this side. The bumps near the horizontal direction ( = 90 degrees) are related to the guided

-z directions at 50 mA in injection current of samples A’(550) and B’(550) are shown. Here, the 
polarization ratios of the emissions in the z and -z directions of sample A’(550) (B’(550)) are only 
1.07 and 1.04 (1.06 and 1.05), respectively. Such small polarization ratios indicate that the observed 
polarization ratios from Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) are due to the near-field SP coupling, instead of the 
far-field diffraction effect.

4. Numerical Simulation Results 
 
In Fig. 4, the maximum emissions in the –z direction of samples A and B are observed at different 
grating periods. It is expected that the SP modes induced on the Ag gratings may include SPP and 
LSP. On a flat metal/dielectric interface, without a momentum matching mechanism, SPP does not

GaN layer of infinite thickness. 
 
 
It is noted that the simulation results in Figs. 10 and 11 may include the contributions of SPP 
and LSP. To isolate the contribution of LSP, we consider the structure of single metal stripe for 
simulation. Figures 12 and 13 show the absorption power spectra of various stripe widths 
corresponding to the gratings of different periods for the cases without and with the SiO2 layer, 
respectively. In these two figures, we still use  values to label the cases of the corresponding 
gratings. The stripe width is /2. Here, a spectral peak corresponds to an LSP resonance mode. 
Generally, the resonance red shifts when  becomes larger. By inserting the SiO2 layer, the 
corresponding LSP resonance features blue shift. Here, one can see that the vertical dotted line, 
which indicates the LED operation wavelength, roughly coincides with the peak of the curve of  =

sample A(550) and B(500). 
 
 
5. Discussions 
 
In all our experimental results from the LED samples with SP-QW coupling, the emission intensity 
on the bottom size (the -z side) is always stronger than that on the top side. It is noted that on either 
side, the emission comes from two parts, including the part emitted directly from carrier 
recombination in the QWs and another part from SP radiation. Only the part from SP radiation leads 
to polarized output. In most conventional LED structures, bottom emission is stronger than top 
emission. This trend becomes stronger in our devices because of the reflection of the QW-emitted 
light from the Ag grating stripes. Regarding the contribution of SP radiation, the results in Fig. 14 
shows the stronger emission on the bottom side. Also, with the dipole excitation from the bottom 
side of the Ag grating, the results shown in Figs. 10 and 11 imply the stronger SP radiation on the 
bottom side [24]. Therefore, the combined emission on the bottom side is expected to be stronger. It 
is speculated that the bottom/top emission intensity ratio in the contribution of direct QW emission 
is significantly larger than that in the contribution of SP radiation. Therefore, the weighting of the 
un-polarized component from QW emission on the bottom side is higher than that on the top side, 
leading to the relatively smaller polarization ratio on the bottom side, when compared with that on 
the top side. This is particularly true in sample series A, which are expected to have the stronger 
SP-QW coupling effect than sample series B. 
 In Fig. 5(a), one can see the broader emission spectra in the -z direction, when compared with 
that in the z direction. The spectrum-integrated intensity in the -z direction is stronger partially 
because of the broader spectra. Since the spectrum is expected to be narrower in the contribution of 
SP radiation due to the frequency selection nature of SP coupling and radiation, the relatively 
broader spectra of the bottom emission in Fig. 5(a) shows the consistent result of stronger 
contribution from QW emission on the bottom side. In Fig. 5(b), the even broader spectra indicate 
the relatively weaker SP coupling effect in sample B(500). 
 Compared with the results from one of our previous publications on the similar subject [22], 
the extent of LED output intensity enhancement and induced polarization ratio in the current work 
are not significantly increased even though the SiO2 layer is added. Such results can be attributed to 
the different Ag grating structures between this work and Ref. 22. In Ref. 22, to fabricate an Ag 
grating, we first etched p-GaN to form a periodical groove structure and then deposited a thick Ag 
layer. In the current work, we fabricate periodical Ag stripes on flat p-GaN surface with the liftoff 
technique. With the structure of semiconductor grooves, the induced LSP field distribution can be 
closer to the LED QWs such that the SP-QW coupling effect is relatively stronger. Therefore, 
without the SiO2 layer in the current work, both output enhancement and polarization ratio are
