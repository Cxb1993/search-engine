Abstract 
A direct-forcing pressure correction method is developed to simulate fluid-particle interaction problems. In 
this paper, the sedimentation flow is investigated. This method uses a pressure correction method to solve 
incompressible flow fields. A direct forcing method is introduced to capture the particle motions. It is found 
out that the direct forcing method can be also served as a wall-boundary condition. By applying the Gauss’s 
divergence theorem, the formulas for computing the hydrodynamic force and torque acting on the particle 
from flows are derived from the volume integral of the particle instead of the particle surface. The order of 
accuracy of the present method is demonstrated by the errors of velocity, pressure, and wall stress. To 
demonstrate the efficiency and capability of the present method, sedimentations of one spherical particle in 
an enclosure are simulated. 
 
Keywords ： pressure correction method, direct forcing method, fluid-particle interaction, 
sedimentation, Gauss’s divergence theorem. 
 
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The task of developing numerical methods used 
to simulate fluid-particle interaction flows is a 
challenging task, and there is also a need for 
understanding many physical phenomena involved 
in these flow problems. A fluid-particle interaction 
flow involves many kinds of interactions, such as 
fluid-fluid, particle-particle, and fluid-particle 
interactions. The corresponding physical problems 
include two-phase, solid-fluid mixture, and 
sedimentation flow problems. The needed methods 
are to track the interface positions between two 
phases and to compute the interaction forces 
between a fluid and a particle. A series of numerical 
methods will be developed to handle these 
interactions and to simulate their flow behaviors. In 
this paper, a pressure correction method [1-2] 
coupled with a direct-forcing method is developed

the boundary condition of equals to zero. If the 
Neumann boundary condition is used for the 
pressure, then the Neumann boundary condition is 
also used for . From theoretical point of view, the 
term C  stands for adding some compressibility 
effect on the fluid system as the weakly 
compressibility model did. After a series of 
numerical experiments, we find out that the chosen 
value of C  between 0 and 0.1 did not affect the 
accuracy of the present method. The value of D  
actually depends on the reference velocity. As the 
reference velocity is normalized to be equal to 1, 
then D can be chosen as  
21.0 xD                         (7) 
The choice of D  can produce a fourth-order 
truncation error in the modified pressure correction 
equation, and doesn’t affect the accuracy of the 
proposed pressure correction method. In our 
numerical experience, the parameter, D , can equal 
to 0 for sedimentation flow computations. It is 
noted that the pressure correction method only does 
one corrector step for the pressure and velocity 
fields. We have tried to perform the second 
corrector step on the pressure and velocity fields, 
but they are little difference between these two 
numerical results in test cases presented in this 
paper.  
 
2.2 Direct-forcing method 
  To capture the particle motion, a direct forcing 
on the grid points around the particle is introduced. 
First, a volume fraction function, B , is defined to 
identify the body cell ( B =1) in the particle, the 
fluid cell ( B =0) and the interface cell (0< B <1). If 
the particle is a sphere, one can use the distance 
between the center of the sphere and the cell 
element to define the volume fraction function. 
Let CX

 and R be the center and radius of the 
sphere, B, respectively. The volume fraction 
function, B , is defined as follows:

the interface, 0 xoutin    (For simplicity, 
zyx  ). This method is to make sure the 
volumes occupied by the inner and the outer 
interfaces equal to each other.  
 
Now, the procedure of the direct-forcing pressure 
correction method is introduced as following. At 
time ntt  , let the velocity and pressure, 
nu and np , at each grid point, x , be given. First, the 
predicted velocity, *u , is obtained from Eq. (2) 
without adding any forcing term at the time *t . By 
using the predicted velocity and the particle 
velocity, 1, nPU

corrected velocity, **u , is corrected by 
 1,)(*))(1()*(*  npBB Uxuxxu
      (9) 
We note that when x is in the fluid cell, **u  is 
again equal to *u . After applying this direct forcing 
on each grid point, the fluid velocity on the body 
cell equals to the velocity of the particle. This direct 
forcing method is very straightforward. Of course, 
the key point of this direct-forcing method is how to 
appropriately choose the volume fraction 
function, B . By applying the Gauss’s divergence 
theorem, the surface integral can be transformed 
into a volume integral. Then the hydrodynamic 
force and torque acting on the particle is obtained 
by

The volume integral makes our numerical method 
easier to implement, specially, in the simulation of 
the sedimentation of a large number of spherical 
particles.  
 
2.3 Implementation of Direct-Forcing Pressure 
Correction Method 
  The direct-forcing pressure correction method is 
implemented in two- and three-dimensional 
particulate flows. The first issue is how to 
determine the volume fraction function B . One can 
use the signed distance function, S , which equals 
to the shortest distance with a sign of the grid point 
to the particle. It is defined as 0S  when the 
point is outside the particle. Then the volume 
fraction function, B , can be defined to identify the

1nu  and 1np .

III. NUMERICAL TEST 
Several test cases are investigated by the 
proposed pressure correction method. They include 
two-dimensional channel flow, flow past a fixed 
sphere, and sedimentation of one spherical particle 
in a wide enclosure. The Algorithm A presented in 
Subsection 2.3 is used to simulate the first two test 
cases and the Algorithm B is used to simulate the 
third test cases. For the error analysis, let )( 1xErr   
and )( 2xErr   be the errors on two consecutive 
grid systems. The errors can be expressed by: 
2,1    ,)()(  ixaxErr bii           (15) 
in which the constant, a , and the order, b , can be 
computed.  
 
3.1 Two dimensional channel flow 
  The first test case is a two-dimensional channel 
flow with a uniform velocity profile at the entrance 
of the channel. After normalization by the entrance 
velocity, the normalized velocity at the entrance is 
set to be 1 and the pressure at the exit is given by 1. 
The boundary condition at the lower and upper 
walls is treated by the direct forcing method. 
Theoretically, a well-developed flow field will be 
developed in the downstream region. The 
well-developed velocity profile and the wall stress 
are given by

In this test case, the Reynolds number is set to be 
100. Here, the non-slip condition on the solid 
boundaries and the errors of the velocity profile and 
wall stress are investigated. 
  The computational domain is chosen to be [0, 6] 
× [-0.5, 1.5]. The grid system is carefully arranged 
so that the boundaries of solid plates are placed on 
the mesh points. Then the volume fraction 
function, B , can be defined as following:

Three grid sizes are used, yx   = 1/10, 1/20 
and 1/40. The parameter vector ( C , D ) in Eq. (14) 
is chosen as (0.1, 0.1 2x ). Fig. 1 shows the 
velocity profiles at three different cross-sections, 
x = 1.2, 3, and 4.8, respectively. The non-slip 
condition on the wall is obtained by this grid system. 
The well-developed flow field occurs at x= 4.8. 
We define the errors of the velocity, ( )Err u , wall 
stress, )( wErr  , at the cross section, x= 4.8, as 
follows:

Table 1 shows the errors and their corresponding 
orders of convergence at x= 4.8. It shows that the 
Algorithm A is about first-order accurate with a 
small constant a  in Eq. (15) in the velocity field 
and is higher than first-order accurate in the wall 
stress.  
 
3.2 Flow past a fixed sphere  
  The behaviours of flows past a fixed sphere at 
varying Reynolds numbers have been studied by a 
number of researchers by numerical and 
experimental methods. Taneda [5] used flow 
visualization technique to study the wake behaviour 
under 5<Re<300. He claimed that 
when 24Re  the flow field becomes separated 
and when 130Re  the wake becomes unsteady. 
Recent Wu and Faeth [6] found out that the flow 
pattern remains steady and axis symmetry up to 
Reynolds about 210. Tomboulides [7] presented 
numerical results by the special element method in 
the range 1000Re20  and by large-eddy 
simulation at .102Re 4  He showed that the 
flow becomes separated when 20Re  and the 
flow is axis symmetry till .212Re   Achenbach 
[8] found out that when ,300Re   the flow field 
becomes axis non-symmetry but it still exist a plane 
that the flow is symmetry. Here, four Reynolds 
numbers Re = 50, 100, 150, and 200 are selected in 
the test. The computational domain is 
20D×10D×10D with a uniform Cartesian grid.  
The center of a fixed sphere is located at (x, y, z) = 
(10D, 5D, 5D). In such a grid system, we found out 
that the flow fields are axis symmetry under these 
four Reynolds numbers. The parameter 
values, 1.0C , 0D , are used. At the inlet, 
the uniform velocity is given and the pressure 
equals to that of the nearest interior point. At the 
outlet, the pressure equals to 1 and the velocity 
equals to that of the nearest interior point. The 
Neumann boundary condition is given at the upper 
and lower wall. First, D = 10 and

[1-2] is used. A distinct element method (DEM) [3] is introduced to calculate effects of contact 
between solid bodies and between solids and walls. The DEM models the collision force between 
two particles by a spring and dashpot, which represent elastic and damping forces, respectively. 
However, a typical DEM calculation requires a much smaller time step compared with the pressure 
correction method. Here, the DEM is introduced into the pressure correction method to simulate the 
solid-fluid mixture flows. 
The fluid-fluid interaction is called as the two-phase flow problem. Many different flow methods have 
proposed to track the interface between two flows [4-6]. Here, the VOF method is used. In this paper, the 
pressure correction method will combine the IB and direct-forcing IB methods to solve the solid-fluid 
mixture flows [7-10]. Also by applying the Gauss theorem, one can derive the formulas for computing the 
hydrodynamic force and torque acting on a particle by a volume integral instead of by a surface integral [7]. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly describe the governing equations 
for the solid-fluid mixture flows. In Section 3 the numerical methods are introduced. In Section 4, two 
physical problems, collapse of multiple solid cylinder layers and two-dimensional solid-fluid mixture flow, 
are performed to demonstrate efficiency and accuracy of the proposed pressure correction method. The final 
conclusions are stated in Section 5. 
 
2. Governing equations  
We consider the two-dimensional incompressible flows of two immiscible fluids (such as liquid/liquid or 
liquid/gas), governed by the Navier-Stokes equations: 
0 u

to avoid the numerical wiggles for handling the large jump of density ratio problems.

two-phase flows.

4. Numerical results 
Two physical problems, collapse of multiple solid cylinder layers and two-dimensional solid-fluid mixture 
flows, are performed to demonstrate efficiency and accuracy of the proposed pressure correction method. 
 
4.1 Collapse of multiple solid cylinder layers by the DEM 
The collapse of multiple solid cylinder layers is performed to verify the accuracy of the DEM. Fig. 1 is the 
schematic of the collapse of six cylinder layers in a two-dimensional square tank with a length and a height 
of 26cm. The solid cylinders are made of aluminium and have a density of 3/7.2 cmg , diameter of 1.0cm. 
The initial stationary state of the cylinder layers is maintained by a plate that could be withdrawn. Solid 
layers with five or six cylinders are alternately piled up between the left wall of the tank and the plate which 
is 6cm from the wall. The total numbers of the solid cylinders are 33. After the plate was quickly removed 
vertically upwards, the cylinder layers began collapsing due to gravity and the cylinders run toward the right 
wall of the tank. The transient behaviour is simulated by the DEM. The numerical results will be compared 
with the experimental data of Zhang et al. [11]. 
  In this simulation, the stiffness, nk , in normal direction, the Poisson ratio, , the turning parameter, cn , 
and the maximum static friction coefficient,  , are chosen as following:
