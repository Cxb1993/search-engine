Abstract — A new nonparametric method to 
identify multivariable Hammerstein models is 
presented. The Hammerstein model is 
characterized by a combination of a linear 
dynamic subsystem and an algebraic nonlinear 
function. There could be many different models 
that give the same input-output realization. The 
purpose of this identification is to find out one 
among those models for controller design. This 
identification uses a sequence of specially 
designed test signals for excitation. The linear 
dynamic subsystem is identified as a finite 
sequence of impulse response (FIR), and the static 
nonlinearity is identified as a multi-input 
multi-output (MIMO) functional mapping. By 
making use of this special test signal, the FIR 
sequence can be estimated under a single-input 
single-output (SISO) framework. Moreover, the 
identification for linear subsystem can be 
decoupled from that for the nonlinear static part. 
This nonparametric model can be used for model 
predictive control applications to achieve better 
control performance. 
Keywords: Nonparametric identification, 
Hammerstein model, MIMO process, Nonlinear 
control. 
 
1. Introduction 
Most of dynamics of chemical processes are 
non-linear in nature. In order to be able to 
describe global behavior of the system, many 
research activities have been focused on 
developing methods for modeling and 
identification of such nonlinear systems. One of 
the most frequently used nonlinear models is the 
Hammerstein model, which is composed of a 
non-memory function as the static nonlinearity 
part followed by a linear dynamical sub-system. 
Because of this model structure, the model 
expressions of the process are not unique, 
especially, for MIMO systems.  
Many methods for modeling and 
identification of Hammerstein-type systems 
published in open literature focused on the SISO 
systems. Only few exceptions dealt with the 
MIMO systems (e.g. Al-Duwaish and Karim 
(1997); Rollins et al. (2003)). The methods for 
identification of MIMO Hammerstein system 
differ mainly in the way the static nonlinearity is 
represented and the optimization problem finally 
formulated. In parametric approaches, the static 
functional nonlinearity is expressed in terms of 
polynomials, neural networks, and some 
expansions of basis functions. Priori process 
 3 
switches between zero and a non-zero constant in 
a random manner while keeping all other inputs 
being zero. The excitation signals are as shown in 
Fig. 2. The number of such excitations equals the 
number of input variables. It follows that each 
dummy input at the Jth stage is a PRBS switching 
between zero and a non-zero constant as well. 
Notice that each vj(k)  is synchronized to uJ(k) . 
As we will show in the following, such a test 
signal makes the identification of LTI element 
possible. 
3.2. Estimation of FIR Matrix. Consider the 
LTI element in a 2 × 2 Hammerstein process. 
We denote a PRBS input that has levels at a 
and b as PRBS(a,b). The inputs at the first 
stage for excitation are u1(k) = PRBS( 1u ,0) and 
u2(k) = 0. As a result, the intermediate inputs at 
this stage are 
)2()0),0,(()(
)0),0,(()(
122

=
=
 
Then, at the second stage, u1(k) = 0, u2(k) = 
PRBS( 2u ,0) and thus we have 
)3()0),,0(()(
)0),,0(()(
222

The switch times of v1(k) and v2(k) is always 
synchronized to those of u1(k) and u2(k) in each 
of the two stages, respectively. The 
input-output relationship of eq 1 can be written, 
provided 1α 2α ≠0, as

Equation 4 shows that the nonlinear functions in 
F(•) can be scaled by any nonzero constants 
because the LTI subsystem can compensate it 
accordingly. Thus, we can designate f1( 1u ,0) as 
1u  and f2(0, 2u ) as 2u . Consequently, the 
dummy inputs at these two stages are defined as 
follows. At the first stage, v1(k) = u1(k) and v2(k) 
= p2 u1(k), where 1122 /)0,( uufp2 α= . Similarly, 
at the second stage, v1(k) = p1u2(k) and v2(k) = 
u2(k), where 22111 /),0( uufp α= . Notice that the 
values of 1u  and 2u  are given by the excitation 
signals, while the values of p1 and p2 are 
parameters to be specified. A 2 × 2 input-output 
realization of the LTI element in eq 1 can be 
written as

Notice that if the LTI element has time delay, the 
all-zero rows in φ~  and η  have to be removed. 
Since the row number of φ~  is always larger 
than the column number and all elements of φ~  
are identified, we can now estimate the 
unobserved intermediate variable v~  by the 
method of least-squares, i.e. 
)15(~)~~(~ 1 ηφφφv TT −=  
Thus, the nonlinearity is identified as the 
mapping from u(k) to )(~ kv  thus obtained, that 
is, )(~ˆ(k):)(~ kv→• uF . Having the FIR sequence 
and the nonlinear function, it will be able to 
predict the output from the given input, u(k). The 
model up to this stage has been identified. 
4.3. Measurement Noise. If the noise e is 
random and white, v~ˆ  in eq 15 is an unbiased  
estimate of v~ . Moreover, if the number of rows 
in φ~  approaches infinity, v~ˆ  is a consistent 
estimate of v~ . To increase the row number of φ~ , 
we can proceed to test using the signal of which 
the steps are identical to those of  previously 
used input, but the sequence is randomly 
scrambled. In this way, more equations for the 
unknown v~  can be set up in eq 13 and hence a 
more consistent estimate of v~  could result. 
However, this is at the cost of prolonged 
experiment time. In case of strong noise level, it 
is suggested that the measurement is first passed 
through a filter to reduce the effect of noise and 
maintain accurate identification of model without 
extra test. Another way to deal with the noise is 
fitting the estimated data set with a nonlinear 
function because the noise will be filtered out by 
the fitting procedure. 
 
5. Tuning Matrix P~ for Model-Based Control 
According to the identification algorithm 
presented in sections 3 and 4, the resulting 
Hammerstein model is given in Fig. 4 in a 
nonparametric form. In this model, the LTI 
element consists of two blocks, Q(l) and 1~ −P , 
where Q(l) is defined by several identified  
SISO FIR sequences. Based on the given P~ ,  
the associated intermediate variable v~  is 
estimated and then a nonlinearity )(~ •F  results 
accordingly. Generally, the values of 1~p  and 
2
~p  can be arbitrarily given (provided 1~~ 21 ≠pp ), 
so that these two components of a MIMO 
Hammerstein model are not unique. In other 
words, for a given input-output set, many 
combinations of different static nonlinearity 
)(~ •F  and LTI subsystem )(~ lH  may have 
identical outputs. Therefore, it gives engineers 
the flexibility to choose a model representation 
for better control. In the proposed model shown 
in Fig. 4, this flexibility is achieved by selecting 
the values at the off-diagonal entries of P~ . By a 
proper selection of this P~  matrix, parametric 
models are developed for model-based control 
uses. A control structure for Hammerstein type 
nonlinear process is as shown in Fig. 5, where GC 
can be a conventional PID controller or an MPC 
controller (Fruzzetti et al., 1997). Assume the 
nonlinearity )(~ •F  is invertible so that the design 
of GC depends only on )(~ lH . Thus, the 
 7 
these four variables are RR = 3, V = 0.8, xD = 
0.935, and xB = 0.065. 
The proposed method is used to identify a 
Hammerstein model based on simulation data 
with a sampling time of 10s. The operating 
region for this system was chosen to be (15% 
around the steady-state vales. The exciting 
signals for the estimation of FIR matrix are u1(k) 
= PRBS(0.225,0), u2(k) = 0 at the first stage and 
u1(k) = 0, u2(k) = PRBS(0.06,0) at the second 
stage. Then, a multivariable multistep signal 
which covers all the combination of u1 = 
{-0.45:0.045:0.45}, u2 = {-0.12:0.012:0.12} is 
used to estimate the nonlinearity. Colored noises, 
w(k), with autoregressive dynamics of order 1 
(i.e., w(k) = 0.8 w(k - 1) + e(k)) are added to the 
outputs to simulate a more realistic scenario. The 
noise-to-signal ratio (NSR), defined as the 
following, is around 20%. 
(signal)) (absmean 
(noise)) (absmean NSR =  
The output response to multi-step inputs is 
shown in Fig. 6. Based on the excitation of PRBS, 
the matrix Q(l) is first identified. We assume that 
all dynamics of the LTI subsystem are 
represented as ARX of order (1,1) without time 
delay, and the parameters are found as 1~p  = 
-0.213 and 2~p  = -0.014. The identified impulse 
response sequences are shown in Fig. 7. Based on 
this LTI model, the corresponding input-output 
mappings of the nonlinearity are thus estimated 
from the test of multistep signal. This mapping 
has been fitted with multi-variable polynomials 
of order 5, as shown in Fig. 8. The simulated 
response of the identified Hammerstein model is 
compared with the actual response in Fig. 9, 
where a good agreement between them can be 
observed. For the purpose of comparison, random 
signals covering the operating region were used 
to excite the process, and a linear model (FIR 
matrix) is thus identified using the least-squares 
estimation. The simulated response of the 
identified linear model is also shown in Fig. 9. 
Clearly, the predictive capability of the 
Hammerstein model outperforms that of the 
linear model.
