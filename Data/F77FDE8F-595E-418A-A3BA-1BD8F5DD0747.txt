二、報告內容 
前言 
    半導體奈米晶體(nanocrystal)或量子點因其獨特的奈米尺度效應而廣泛應用於各種元
件中，其中以化學合成方式製備之量子點溶液因其具有較大的使用彈性而受到高度重視，
目前關於量子點的新穎製備法及應用皆受到廣泛研究，製作方式已有大幅進展，除了製作
難度降低、合成方式更為環保之外，量子點本身之品質與可靠度也有明顯提升，加上目前
雜質摻雜與量子點表面改質/修飾的技術，和控制界面活性劑的分佈以改變形狀，某些量子
點的應用如生醫方面作為癌細胞或腫瘤偵測劑、高效率光轉換發光二極體等都已經進入成
熟階段，市面上亦逐漸出現相關產品。 
  研究目的 
    化學合成之量子點製作簡單，獨特的物理特性使得量子點可以應用在多種量子電子及
光電元件中，因此是相當具有研究與應用價值的研發主題。有鑑於目前奈米科技對國家科
學發展的重要性，並基於本團隊之前之研究基礎，本計畫嘗試使用多波長量子點製作混成
型白光及單色光發光二極體，以作為未來白光照明之應用。另外由於量子點無機天性，不
受大氣水氧影響而產生退化，因此在可撓曲有機元件中，用以取代元件之活性層可大幅增
加元件可靠度，甚至發展為全無機可撓曲元件，亦是目前此領域之研究重點。最後配合國
立成功大學微電所在新穎元件上之卓越成果，依據部分現有及發展中之理論基礎，以量子
點改善現有元件特性，開發量子點的潛在應用。 
研究方法

i. 於奈米螢光粉中溶入金屬奈米粒子，利用金屬粒子之表面電漿子(surface plasmon)
特性提升元件效能 
三. 混成型量子點電激發光元件之研製 
a. 製作色彩可調變之同質接面有機發光二極體 
因此對於粒徑極小之量子點，需使用特殊方法降低成長速率，以提高粒徑均勻度。 
    為了使用 TEM 觀察量子點實際大小，我們將量子點溶液稀釋後以滴管滴於銅網上並加
熱烤乾，其 TEM 掃瞄照片如圖二所示。 
(a) (b)
 
圖二、(a)紅光(620 nm)與(b)綠光(530 nm)量子點之 TEM 照片 
    從圖中我們可以發現，當量子點濃度稀釋至夠低的情況下，紅光量子點之粒徑清晰可
見，然而當發光波長小於 550nm 時，量子點粒徑大幅減小，導致 TEM 掃瞄照片中量子點
輪廓不清楚，造成粒徑判別上之困難。 
量子點-甲苯溶液因具有疏水性，可均勻塗佈於超音波震盪清洗後之玻璃基板上，亦可
與其他高分子聚合物共同溶於甲苯中而不形成相分離，作為電激發光元件之主要發光層。
旋轉塗佈形成之量子點薄膜其量子效率大幅降低，因為在手套箱中薄膜不受水氧影響，故
量子效率之降低應與氧化反應無關。之前有文獻指出將量子點與 PMMA 適量共溶於甲苯中
在塗佈形成薄膜，薄膜之量子效率可保持與溶液相同，即可使用於奈米螢光粉之研究中。 
    另外為了增加量子點之應用並製作多發光層電激發光元件，我們嘗試使用表面修飾的
方式製作親水性量子點，實驗中利用 MUA (11-mercaptoundecanoic acid)來將其表面修飾為
親水性。製備步驟如下: 
MUA親水性修飾 
1. 取 40 mg 的 CdSe/ZnS 奈米量子點溶於 30 mL 的甲醇(methanol) 後放入於雙頸反
應瓶中， 接著利用氫氧化四甲銨(tetramethylammonium hydroxide)將其 pH 值調到
11 以上 
2. 取 40 mg 的 MUA 溶解在 CdSe/ZnS 的甲醇溶液中，接著在避光、氮氣正壓的環境
下加熱至 65°C 進行迴流反應，整個過程持續 24 小時 
3. 將溫度降到 30°C，並洗去多餘的未反應物 
4. 取反應液加入乙酸乙酯(ethyl acetate)及乙醚(ether)使奈米量子點沈澱並作離心(8000 
rpm, 3min)，倒掉上清液，再加入甲醇溶解沈澱物，重複此步驟二次 
5. 將 CdSe/ZnS-MUA 溶液利用真空幫浦抽乾，即完成 CdSe/ZnS-MUA 親水性量子點
之修飾 
我們將完成修飾後的量子點分別溶於 10mL 之溶媒中，使用之溶媒包含去離子水,甲醇及丙
酮，並觀察比較不同溶媒對量子點發光特性之影響。 
    經由 MUA 修飾的 CdSe/ZnS 量子點，表面包覆有硫醇基，其在水溶液中容易產生聚集
的現象，此現象一般解釋為因水溶液的 pH 值造成其表面雙硫鍵解離，形成親疏水端共存
的現象，導致量子點疏水端互相吸附而產生聚集，嚴重時會因外部的親水端全部解離，造
成奈米量子點大量聚集而在水溶液中產生沉澱的現象，降低量子點溶解度。 
二. CdSe/ZnS 量子點-InGaN/GaN 量子井混成型光轉換發光二極體之研製

間中之最大角度不同，可能是元件封裝時螢光粉受到液態環氧樹脂影響而分佈不均，同時
造成光強度最強位置不在垂直角上，光發散角約為 98°。

       因為螢光粉由 DBPPV 及量子點組成，DBPPV 與量子點緊密結合，Förster 共振能量轉
移理論告訴我們，由 DBPPV 放射之黃綠光可能透過 Förster 共振轉移的方式將能量傳遞給
量子點，造成量子點放射紅光，如圖六，其中 ET1 是及 ET2 分別是從 InGaN/GaN 量子井
放射出之藍光被 DBPPV 和量子點吸收的能量轉移作用，而 ET3 則為 DBPPV 和量子點之間
的能量轉移。其發生機率與 Förster 半徑 RF之關係如下:

由以上公式，我們確認 ET1 與 ET2 僅可能為主客體間之光吸收轉換，因為主客體距離過大，
此部分無關 Förster 共振能量轉移。為了分析 Förster 共振轉移之發生機率，我們使用光譜重
疊法計算能量主體(Host)DBPPV 與客體(Guest)量子點間之 Förster 半徑約為 53Å，代入上式
可得機率為 32%。以上關於混成型白光發光二極體的研究成果已發表於國際期刊中。[1][2]

    在改善量子點量子效率的同時，我們嘗試於螢光粉中溶入金奈米粒子，以金奈米粒子
所感應之表面電漿子效應改善元件效率。透過合作的方式，我們取得之金奈米粒子溶於水，
粒徑分別為 30、50、70、90nm，其吸收光譜如圖七(a)，吸收波峰隨著粒徑增加而紅移，奈
米粒子水溶液在乾淨玻璃上接觸角過大，必須經過 O2 電漿處理才可塗佈成為均勻薄膜，薄
膜之原子力顯微鏡(AFM)照片如圖六(b)，可清楚看見部分金屬粒子有聚集現象。

圖九、(a)第一與(b)第二類型元件之變電流電激光譜(c)隨著電流增加，元件 CIE 座標之偏移 
    並且從我們先前的研究結果，分別使用 poly-TPD 與 Alq3 作為電洞與電子傳輸層可有
效造成量子點電激發光，但製作元件時，為了增加效能，量子點發光層之厚度往往只有幾
個單原子層(<50 nm)，因此無法使用快速塗佈法製作雙發光層，在白光量子點元件的製作
上，我們改採用有機(PFO)-無機(量子點)混合膜作為發光層，其中 PFO 可發藍光，綠光與
紅光材料則為量子點，元件結構如圖十(a)，主要發光層為 PFO/QD 混合層，我們比較量子
點摻入元件發光層的效應，其電激光譜有明顯的差異，使用適當的結構可得到適當的三元
色光強度比而形成高品質白光，從光譜強度分佈，我們認為量子點的發光機制來自於電子
電洞的直接注入，因為我們之前的研究顯示，使用能量轉移的方式造成量子點發光，其強
度遠小於激發光源，因此無法形成純白光。從 IV 曲線我們觀察到負微分電阻效應，造成的
原因可能是 ITO 處理不當、有機無機混合效應、載子分佈不均勻或薄膜不同質。此初步結
果已發表於國際期刊 IEEE Photonics Technology Letters [5]。

圖十、(a)白光混成元件之結構圖(b)有無使用量子點之元件電激光譜比較 
回顧之前的文獻，關於小分子發光二極體的製作，某些研究群發現使用P型氧化鎳(NiO)
作 為 電 洞 傳 輸 層 可 有 效 提 升 元 件 亮 度 及 效 率 ， 其 中 使 用 元 件 結 構 為
ITO/NiO/TPD/Alq3/LiF/Al，可將原本的元件啟動電壓由 5V 降低至 3V，同時亮度也有大幅
提昇[6]。這樣的結果讓我們認為氧化鎳同樣可用於量子點元件中以提升元件特性。 
首先我們使用鍍有 ITO 的玻璃基板來成長 NiO 薄膜，我們使用的方法是低溫磁控式濺
鍍法，靶材為 3 吋 NiO，成長條件為: 通入氣體 Ar:O2=0:100%，成長壓力為 8 mtorr, RF 功
率為 170W，基板溫度分別為室溫(NiO-A)及 400℃(NiO-B)，其透光度結果如圖十一(a)，我
們發現即使 NiO 厚度僅為 20nm 亦會造成可見光穿透率大幅降低至 75%以下。另外量測其
游離能結果如圖十一(b)，NiO 游離能約為 5.6 eV，遠高於傳統電洞傳輸層 PEDOT:PSS(5.1 
eV)。

35 and 82%, respectively, by comparing with a fluorescent standard
rhodamine 6G in ethanol, QY = 95%.12 To achieve white light
emission, the blend ratio of DBPPV:QD was constantly held at 1:2
and the solution had a blue-complementary yellow emission with
Commission internationale de l’eclairage CIE-1931 chromaticity
coordinates of 0.442, 0.541. In our previous study, the DBPPV/QD
blend had been spin coated on the LED wafer and white light was
generated by controlling the blend film thickness. However, the DB-
PPV in the blend film suffered from photo-oxidation, which led to
the chain scission of the vinylene double bond, and the hybrid
WLEDs degraded rapidly.13 With that device configuration, further
packaging of single chips is quite challenging. The surface passiva-
tion or encapsulation of the DBPPV/QD blend beneath a whole LED
wafer is also impracticable. Because the colloidal QDs were able to
be blended with epoxy resin in a wide concentration range,14 the
DBPPV/QD in a resin matrix should be a good strategy to prevent
the degradation of DBPPV. Therefore, the DBPPV/QD solution was
subsequently blended with a commercially available resin in differ-
ent ratios to obtain the DBPPV–QD composites. The resin was used
to increase viscosity and mechanical strength. The cured resin would
also prevent the photo-oxidation of DBPPV in ambient air and the
out-diffusion of the composite if further LED packaging of hemi-
spherical dome encapsulation was adopted.14,15 Finally, the compos-
ites in resin matrices were dropped on blue InGaN/GaN QW LEDs
embedded in reflector cups to complete the fabrication. The elec-
troluminescence EL peak EQW of blue LEDs was at 454 nm with
a full width at half-maximum of 17 nm. Noticeably, it was at the
same location as the first excitation peak of DBPPV. To adjust the
generated white light spectrum, the ratios of DBPPV–QD blends to
resin were set at 1:5, 1:3, 1:2.5, 1:2, and 1:1, and thus fabricated
devices were marked as devices A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. All
devices were preserved in the glove box except for device charac-
teristic measurements.
Results and Discussion
All hybrid devices show an identical turn-on voltage of 2.8 V
and a forward voltage at 20 mA of 3.2 V as those of blue InGaN
LEDs. The EL spectra of the devices are depicted in Fig. 2. Accord-
ingly, the peaks at 525 E1 and 558 nm E2 are attributed to the
intrachain excitonic state and interchain excimeric state emis-
sions from DBPPV, respectively.16 The intensity ratio of E1/E2 ac-
tually depends on the degree of aggregation, polymer concentration,
and QD’s absorption. The peak at about 622 nm is the emission from
QDs EQD. As compared with the PL peak shown in Fig. 1, the
significant blueshift in EQD is mainly attributed to the lesser impact
of the reabsorption effect photons emitted from smaller QDs are
absorbed by larger QDs in diluted populations. With the blend ratio
increasing, a larger proportion of blue light EQW is converted to
green/red light, and consequently, the blue light is not observed in
devices with a blend ratio of 1:1. More specifically, the variations in
the peak positions of E1, E2, and EQD in the devices are not signifi-
cant, which makes the manipulation of pure white light emission
from the devices with a proper blend ratio possible. Nevertheless,
the ratio of the integrated luminescence intensity of a QD to DBPPV
EQD/E1 + E2 seems to be increased from 0.15 to 0.21. Because
the blend ratios of a QD to DBPPV in the devices are identical, the
increase in the emission contribution from QDs may be associated
with the enhancement of the probability of nonradiative Förster ET
from DBPPV to QDs, which will be discussed later in this section.
The CIE-1931 coordinates of our hybrid LEDs are depicted in Fig.
3. The connection of the coordinates almost becomes a straight line
as predicted. The coordinates of devices B and D are located at the
edge of the white light area, which can be rated as WLEDs with
poor qualities. The CIE coordinates, correlated color temperatures
CCTs, and CRIs of devices B, C, and D are 0.248, 0.213, 0.325,
0.343, and 0.374, 0.43, 40,000, 5800, and 4800 K, and 34, 75, and
46, respectively. With a more precise adjustment of the composite’s
concentration, the cold and warm white light can be readily
achieved. The CRIs of our tetrachromatic WLEDs are not as high as
expected, which may be due to the short peak separation between E1
and E2 and a minor contribution of EQD.17 Presumably, a 30% in-
crease in EQD can improve the CRI of device C to be 81 and adjust
the CCT to be warm white, without considering the slight redshift in
EQD when the QD concentration is increased. Besides, the luminous
flux of device C is 0.55 lm, and the corresponding luminous efficacy
measured in lumens per optical watt is 330 lm/W as the device is
operated at 20 mA. The excellent efficacy should stem from the high
QY of DBPPV over those of green- and yellow-emitting QDs used.4
The luminous efficiency measured in lumens per electrical watt of
device C can also be derived as 8.6 lm/W. Low values of luminous

Conclusion
Pure white light emission from dual hybrid DBPPV/QD–InGaN
LEDs has been demonstrated. With an appropriate DBPPV/QD
composite, white light with CIE coordinates of 0.325, 0.342, CCT
of 5800 K, and CRI of 75 can be achieved. The luminous flux and
efficacy of device operated at 20 mA are 0.55 lm and 330 lm/W,
respectively. The excellent efficacy can be attributed to the high QY
of DBPPV. Our WLEDs also feature the very distinct temperature
dependence of polymer and QDs. Based on the Förster theory, a
Förster radius of 53 Å between the DBPPV donor and the QD
acceptor is calculated, and a FRET efficiency of 32% is thus de-
duced. In light of the low QY of green-emitting QDs so far, the dual
hybridization of polymer and QDs on InGaN LEDs could become a
viable and promising alternative for improving the efficiency of
color-converted LEDs.

solution.
constantly 1.5 wt%. The absorption and photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of PFO-toluene are shown in Fig. 2. The spectral
spacing between the first absorption peak and the dominant PL
peak is about 60 nm. No overlap of these two spectra is found.
On the other hand, the blend ratios of PFO : green QD : red
QD were chosen to be 6 : 1 : 1 and 5 : 1 : 1 in volume. Because
the concentration of the QD was low, no phase separation was
observed in the composite solutions. The fabrication procedure
of devices is described as follows. First, the patterned indium
tin oxide (ITO) was cleaned by detergent, organic solvents,
and ultraviolet (UV)/ozone treatment. A poly(3,4-ethylene
dioxythiophene) : poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT : PSS)
layer and a poly(N,N’-bis (4-butylphenyl)-N,N’-bis(phenyl)
benzidine) (poly-TPD) layer were spin-coated as the hole trans-
port layer (HTL), while tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminium
Alq was thermally evaporated as the electron transport
layer (ETL). From our previous report, the insertion of a thin
2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) layer
before Alq deposition could dramatically suppress the carrier
recombination in ALq layer, and thus increased the lumines-
cence from QDs [10]. However, to simplify the whole device
process, BCP was not employed in this study. After fabrication,
the device with an emission layer of PFO was marked as
Device A, while the hybrid devices with blend ratios of 6 : 1 : 1
and 5 : 1 : 1 were named as Devices B and C, respectively.
All devices were characterized and preserved in glove box.
The luminance–current–voltage curves were measured by the
combination of a silicon photodetector, a Keithley 2400 source
meter, and a Keithley 2000 multimeter. The calibration of the
absolute luminance (brightness) and the measurement of EL
spectra were carried out by a PR-650 SpectraScan colorimeter.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The current–voltage ( – ) and luminance–voltage ( – )
characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. 3. In order to
prevent the device degradation, the injection current was limited
to be smaller than 20 mA. Consequently, the maximum lumi-
nance of devices was not obtained. The luminance efficiency
of Devices A and B measured at 5 mA is 0.012 and 0.02 cd/A,
respectively. As shown, the pronounced current anomalies at
Fig. 3. (a)  – and (b)– curves of devices with structures shown in Fig. 1.
low voltage were observed in both types of the devices, leading
to the negative differential resistance (NDR) and somewhat
decreasing the reproducibility of device characteristics [11].
This phenomenon appeared only during the first voltage sweep
and was not observed during subsequent measurements. Actu-
ally, it is commonly measured in organic and polymer LEDs,
and has been related to the improper treatment of ITO layer,
blending of emissive materials, imbalance of electron and
hole injections, or film inhomogeneity [11]–[13]. Since our
patterned ITO substrates for devices were all well-treated, and
no spatially localized emission accompanies with the NDR at
low voltage was observed [Fig. 3(b)], the possible origins for
the NDR should be the imbalance of carrier injection and/or
the metal spikes and pinholes in films. Low efficiency of the
devices also suggests this attribution. Regardless of the NDR
effect, the turn-on voltage of Device B ( 20 V) is much higher
than that of Device A ( 20 V). Indeed, the insertion of HTLs
and ETLs could cause the increase of device turn-on voltage in
some circumstances. However, it cannot explain this significant
voltage difference. In Device C with denser QDs, no apparent
device turn-on and appropriate luminance can be observed,
which makes the measurement of EL spectrum impossible.
The increase of turn-on voltage, therefore, should be mainly
attributed to the incorporation of QDs. Because the emission of
QDs can be from the direct carrier injection, the energy transfer
and charge transfer from PFO, the increase of turn-on voltage
after QD incorporation may imply that the QDs are electrically
active and they can effectively trap charge carriers. Though
the reduction of QD concentration may decrease the turn-on
voltage, it can also lead to the imbalance of emission color, and
pure WLEDs cannot be achieved. An effective way to solve

Color-tunable light-emitting diodes with a polymer homojunction structure have been demonstrated. The homojunction structure consisted of two
emissive layers, and poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO) was used as the host material in both emissive layers. One emissive layer was composed of
a blend of blue-emitting PFO and its green-emitting copolymer, and the other one was composed of a blend of green-emitting PFO copolymer and
red-emitting poly[2-methoxy-5(20-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEHPPV). In device characterization, when the injection current was
increased, partial electrons could easily pass through the second emissive layer and flow into the first emissive layer near the anode, because
there was no potential barrier existing in the homojunction. Therefore, the emission color of our devices could be tuned as orange, yellow, white,
and cyan by adjusting the injection current or bias voltage. # 2010 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

1. Introduction
Organic and polymer light-emitting diodes (OLEDs and
PLEDs) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their
applications, such as full-color or large-area ﬂat panel
displays, backlight, and general illumination.1,2) For OLEDs,
the development is much faster than that of PLEDs, and
nowadays, large OLED-television with long lifetime has
been commercially available. Nevertheless, for PLEDs,
their particular solution processibility makes them have the
advantages of low-cost manufacturing and homogeneity in a
large area. Although large-area ﬂat panel displays fabricated
from PLEDs have not been demonstrated thus far, PLEDs
with high brightness, high eﬃciency, and long operation
lifetime were reported.3,4) To obtain high-performance
PLEDs, conjugated polymers are the most used and inves-
tigated emissive materials for their high emission eﬃciency.
The emission spectrum of a conjugated polymer can be
adjusted by various methods, such as polymer blending and
nanocrystal or dye doping, and those using bilayer exciplex
or functional groups;5–8) by these methods, white or color-
tunable PLEDs were fabricated. The energy transfer between
the polymers and nanocrystals (or quantum dots) is also an
interesting topic for improving the device luminescence
eﬃciency.9–11) Poly(9,9-dioctylﬂuorene) (PFO) is one of
the most useful materials owing to its potential to exhibit
full-color emission via energy transfer to longer wavelength
emitters in blends with other ﬂuorescent or phosphorescent
dyes.12) In this study, we have achieved a novel color-
tunable PLED with a homojunction structure. In the
homojunction, PFO acted as the host material. Its green-
emitting copolymer was doped with poly[2-methoxy-5(20-
ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEHPPV) for red
emission, while an identical copolymer was blended with
blue-emitting PFO for blue emission. The injection-current-
dependent electroluminescence (EL) spectra revealed that
the emission color of our PLEDs could be readily tuned from
orange to cyan owing to the absence of potential barriers in
the homojunction.
2. Experimental Procedure
Firstly, the emissive materials, namely, PFO homopolymer,
PFO copolymer, and MEHPPV, were dissolved in toluene
separately. The concentrations of the PFO homopolymer and
copolymer were 3.5 and 0.05wt%, and the PFO homopol-
ymer and copolymer were used as blue and green emission
units, respectively. As the dopant in the emission layer,
MEHPPV–toluene solution was used at 0.5wt%. The
concentration was determined from our earlier studies about
PLEDs. To avoid confusion, the PFO homopolymer and
copolymer were named as PFO-B and PFO-G, respectively.
The homojunction active region of our PLEDs was com-
posed of two blend layers. The ﬁrst active layer was obtained
by spin coating the PFO-G solution doped with 2%
MEHPPV (Blend 1) and baking the ﬁlm at 70 C for
30min. Subsequently, the PFO-B and PFO-G solutions were
mixed at a volume ratio of 1 : 1 (Blend 2) and the blend
solution was then subjected to spin coating to form the
second active layer. Because toluene is a good solvent for
PFO-B, PFO-G, and MEHPPV and there was no phase
separation found in Blend 1 and Blend 2 solutions, the
weight ratio of polymers in composite ﬁlms was derived
from that of polymers in blend solutions. Therefore, the
weight ratios of PFO-G:MEHPPV and PFO-B:PFO-G were
about 5 : 1 and 70 : 1 in the ﬁrst and second active layers,
respectively. To reduce the degree of mutual dissolution of
two active layers, the time interval between dropping the
solution and spinning the vacuum chuck was shortened.
Before depositing the active layers, a highly conductive
poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) layer (100 S/cm) was spin-coated on the
patterned ITO-glass substrate for hole transport. Calcium
and aluminum were ﬁnally evaporated as the cathode.
Therefore, our devices can be described as ITO/PEDOT:
PSS/(PFO-G+MEHPPV)/(PFO-B+PFO-G)/Ca/Al. The
cross region of the anode and cathode deﬁned the device
active area, which was 2 3mm2. We will call these
devices as type I devices in the following description. After
fabrication, the devices were preserved in a glove box, in
which measurements of device characteristics were also
performed. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)E-mail address: laputa@nttu.edu.tw

integrated EL intensity at higher currents should originate
from the repeated and prolonged stress— the questionable
reliability of PLEDs. To conﬁrm this assumption, we
exchanged the deposition sequences of the ﬁrst and second
layers in type I devices and marked the new devices as type II
devices. The EL spectra of type II devices are shown in
Fig. 4(b). With increasing injection current, the EL intensity
from the ﬁrst emission layer (PFO-B+PFO-G) gradually
becomes pronounced and is comparable to that from the
second emission layer. This trend is exactly the same as that of
the ﬂow of electron in type I devices, except that the emission
from the ﬁrst layer does not decrease at larger currents
(biases) for the absence of electrical-stress-induced defects.15)
The blue shift of emission peaks in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) with
injection current increasing, is the feature of conjugated
polymers due to the decrease in eﬀective conjugation
length,16) which was observed in temperature-dependent PL
spectra of composites of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots and 2,3-
dibutoxy-1,4-poly(phenylene vinylene) (DBPPV),17) and/or
the spatial shift of the emission region due to the interference
(cavity) eﬀect. The EL spectra are dominated by the emission
from the second layer both in type I and II devices, possibly
related to the dissolution of the ﬁrst layer. Finally, the
corresponding Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage
(CIE-1931) chromaticity coordinates of the spectra in
Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) at various currents are shown in Fig. 5.
The emission color of type II devices is changed to orange,
yellow, white, and cyan by adjusting the injection current.
This strongly indicates that the green emission mainly
originates from the PFO-G in Blend 1, and the intensity ratio
of PFO-G to MEHPPV remains almost constant at diﬀerent
currents (Fig. 4). We attributed this phenomenon to the
insuﬃcient energy transfer in Blend 2, in which the PFO-B is
the energy donor and the PFO-G is the energy acceptor.
4. Conclusions
Color-tunable PLEDs with a PFO-based homojunction
structure were demonstrated. The PFO homopolymer,
copolymer, and MEHPPV were exploited as blue, green,
and red emission units in our devices. Owing to the absence
of potential barriers within the homojunction, high lumi-
nance (>3000 cd/m2) and low turn on voltage (<7V) were
obtained, and the emission color could be easily tuned
between orange, yellow, white, cyan, and light blue. Since
the mobility of electrons is relatively low in p-type
polymers, the recombination of electron–hole pairs basically
begins in the second emission layer next to the cathode,
regardless of the deposition sequence of emission layers. As
the current is increased, electrons have a higher probability
to ﬂow into the ﬁrst emission layer and recombine with
holes to continuously change the emission color.

Baytron P VP A1 4083 with different concentrations.
The optimum concentrations of glycerol and DMSO in
PEDOT:PSS solutions were 60 and 90 mg/ml, respectively,
which was primarily determined based on our study about
boosting the conductivity of buffer layers.14 Thereby, the
modified solutions were spin coated onto the ultraviolet-
ozone-treated ITO/glass RITEK Corp., 15  / at 4000
rpm for 60 s and then baked at 150 °C for 1 h. Since the
concentration of glycerol and DMSO was not high in PE-
DOT:PSS solution, we simply treated the thicknesses of the
modified PEDOT:PSS layers the same as that of pristine one
for a fair comparison. Regioregular P3HT 98.5% electric
grad, Rieke Metals, Inc. was blended with PCBM Nano-C,
Inc. and then dissolved in 1,2- or o-dichlorobenzene to yield
the P3HT:PCBM 1:1 in weight ratio solution. The blend
solution was stirred for at least 24 h at 40 °C. The
P3HT:PCBM active layer was obtained by the so-called sol-
vent annealing procedure.15 Subsequently, the samples were
transferred onto the Petri glass dishes that were filled up with
the saturated 1,2-o-dichlorobenzene vapor. The whole system
was maintained wet for 2 h. Finally, Ca 60 nm and Al 150
nm were thermally evaporated onto the surface of the
P3HT:PSS film inside a vacuum chamber 110−6 torr to
be the device cathode. All the procedures were implemented
in a nitrogen-filled glove box except for coating the
PEDOT:PSS layer. Current density-voltage J-V character-
istics of the PVs were measured by a Keithley 2400
sourcemeter under white light illumination with the power
density of 90 mW /cm2 Oriel 96500 150 W solar simulator
equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter from the ITO/glass side.
For convenience, the devices with a glycerol-incorporated
PEDOT:PSS buffer layer and a DMSO-incorporated PE-
DOT:PSS buffer layer are, respectively, called G-PVs and
D-PVs in the following description. Besides, the PVs with a
pristine PEDOT:PSS buffer layer is called P-PVs for short.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 2 shows the J-V characteristics of the devices with
a pristine or modified PEDOT:PSS layers. The results of de-
vice characteristics as well as the conductivities of pristine
and modified PEDOT:PSS layers are listed in Table I. The
short-circuit current density Jsc, open-circuit voltage Voc,
and filled factor FF of the P-PVs are 8.86 mA /cm2, 0.6 V,
and 0.65, respectively. As a result, the PCE of P-PVs is
3.44%. Compared with P-PVs, overall, G-PVs and D-PVs
seem to have greatly improved PCEs. Specifically, the maxi-
mum PCEs are 4.12% and 4.27%, which correspond to
19.8% and 24.1% increments, respectively. The FF is also
improved in G-PVs and D-PVs. According to these results,
the incorporation of glycerol and DMSO has decreased the
carrier-trapping defects in PEDOT:PSS and solidified the in-
terface between PEDOT and PSS.14 It is easily appreciated
that the increase in conductivity of buffer layer can lead to
the decrease in series resistance Rs, and thus the device’s
performance is improved.
For above calculation of Jsc and PCEs of these devices,
the nominal active area is 6 mm2, which is the cross area of
Al and ITO electrodes. However, as previously reported,13–16
the actual active area should be larger than the cross area due
to the excess photocurrent generation within the peripheral
P3HT:PCBM where there is no ITO underneath, as shown in
Fig. 3a. The degree of area extension actually depends on
the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. In order to figure out the
area extension details in our devices, three shadow masks
with different aperture sizes were designed to confine the
illuminated area smaller than 6 mm2. As shown in Fig. 3b,
each mask was attached to the PV from the ITO side with its
aperture centered on the electrode overlapping area for the
I-V measurement. The aperture sizes of these shadow masks
were 1.767, 2, and 3 mm2, respectively, and the influence of
extended active area could thus be excluded.
Figure 4 shows the I-V characteristics measured with and
without shielding the devices. The Isc of the devices is regu-
larly increased with increasing aperture size under illumina-
tion. However, it is noticeable that the differences in Isc of
G-PVs and D-PVs measured with the same mask attached
the restricted illumination are not significant, no matter
which mask is used. It implies that the effect of highly con-
ductive PEDOT:PSS on enhancing the performance of these
PVs is limited, despite the conductivity of DMSO-
incorporated PEDOT:PSS is about five times higher than that
of glycerol-incorporated PEDOT:PSS, as shown in Table I.
The PCEs of G-PVs and D-PVs are 3.8% under the re-
stricted illumination. For the condition without mask at-

overlapping region. In our case, to extract the constants and
estimate the real extended length d, more efforts have to be
made. In the present stage, one thing is for sure, d must be
definitely larger than the estimates above.
The above description has exhibited that the measure-
ments of Jsc or PCE of crossbar-type PVs under complete
illumination could be affected by the contribution from the
nonoverlapping region. A length extension of few tens of
micrometers may be of little significance, but it shows its
determining influence especially on PVs with small active
areas. For instance, the deviation of PCE is even higher than
40% if the overlapping region of a G-PV is smaller than
1 mm2. Since the PEDOT:PSS solution with a conductivity
as high as 102 S /cm has been commercially available,13 to
avoid this kind of overestimation, the measurements under
the restricted illumination attached a mask with an aperture
size the same as or smaller than the device’s nominal active
region are recommended, even though we can quickly esti-
mate the extended length by the method of fitting the Isc
under the restricted illumination.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the increase in conductivity of PEDOT:PSS
buffer layer by incorporating glycerol or DMSO has been
demonstrated. However, the PCE enhancement of PVs by
using the modified PEDOT:PSS layer was limited. Most im-
portantly, the active region of the crossbar-type PVs could
extend and additional photogenerated carriers from the non-
overlapping area could contribute the measured Isc. Based
on our calculation, the overestimation of Jsc and PCE be-
comes more significant in PVs as the highly conductive
PEDOT:PSS buffer layer is used in the small-size devices.
We also introduced the simple method, which is able to mea-
sure and fit Isc under the restricted illumination, to quickly
estimate the actual PCE and the extended length as the in-
fluence of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS is concerned.

Impact of CdSe/ZnS quantum dot size on the fabrication of hybrid quantum dot 
light-emitting diodes

Abstract: 
The influence of CdSe/ZnS quantum dot (QD) size on the fabricated hybrid light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 
was investigated. In this study, the device configuration of our hybrid QD-LEDs can be simply depicted as 
ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD/red-  or green-QDs/Alq3/LiF/Al. In device fabrication, a 
poly(3,4,ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and a poly(N,N’-bis 
(4-butylphenyl)-N,N’-bis(phenyl) benzidine) (poly-TPD) were spin-coated as the hole transport layers (HTLs) 
while the tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminium (Alq3) was evaporated as the electron transport layer (ETL). 
The same as ordinary organic/polymer LEDs, the current-voltage characteristics of our hybrid LEDs also 
exhibited the space-charge-limited conduction. From the experimental results, surprisingly, the substitution of 
green-emitting QDs (the diameter, D~3.4 nm) for red-emitting QDs (D~5.8 nm) in the devices has entirely 
shifted the emission center from the QDs to the ETL, Alq3. Accompanying with the variation in the EL spectra, 
the turn-on voltage of the devices were also significantly reduced from 8 V to less than 4 V. It can be clearly 
observed in the electroluminescence (EL) spectra that more than 92% of the EL intensity is from the peak 
located at 622 nm in devices with red-QDs while nearly 100% of the EL emission is from the Alq3-related 
peak at 516 nm in the device with green-QDs. Since the quantum yield (QY) of green-QDs (QY~55%) is 
actually higher than that of red-QDs (QY~35%) and the optical response of the photoelectron spectra also 
suggests that the ionization energy of green-QDs is much higher. The large energy barrier between the 
green-QD and Alq3 has prohibited the carrier recombination within the QD layer. Finally, by replacing the 
poly-TPD with materials that are of higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, the 
QD-LEDs with green-QD-dominant EL spectra can be achieved. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
imprinting onto substrates that cannot be easily spin 
coated with a polymer film, such as flexible polymer 
substrates. However, the same as in hot-embossing 
imprint process, the surface energy of molds has to be 
modified with releasing agents to promote polymer 
release in the typical reversal imprint process. 
Consequently, due to the low surface energy of the 
treated mold, polymer solution in polar solvents is hard 
to be continuous films. 
In the current study, surfactants containing the 
functional carboxyl group were chosen to facilitate the 
integrity of spin-coated PMMA films. In addition, to 
increase the adhesion of transferred PMMA film and 
PET substrate, the surface of PET substrates were 
modified by atmospheric O2 plasma treatment, and the 
subsequent roller pressing was performed in the final 
reversal-imprinting. Based on our demonstration, the 
modified roller-reversal imprint lithography is 
supposed to be a more applicable technique to 
implement the low cost and high throughput, roll to roll 
production. 
 
2. Experimental 
Firstly, the silicon (001) wafer as the hard mold was 
patterned by photolithography or electron beam 
lithography for micro- or nano-scale patterns, 
respectively. The micro-scale patterns were two-
dimensional, square depressions and inverted square 
pyramid arrays fabricated by anisotropic wet etching in 
3M KOH-H2O solution, while the nano-scale patterns 
were a dot array with 800 nm in dot diameter and 
parallel stripes with 80 nm in line width. To promote 
the film release during demolding, mold surface was 
activated (oxidized) by immersing the mold in hot 
piranha solution (90 , H℃ 2O2 : H2SO4 = 3 : 1) for 2 
hours and in octadecyl trichlorosilane 
(CH3(CH2)17SiCl3, OTS) solution (1 mM in heptane) 
over 24 hours for silanization.13 The OTS-molds were 
subsequently soaked in different surfactant-alcohol 
solutions (1 kppm) at room temperature for subsequent 
PMMA wetting. The used surfactants were 4-
ethylbenzoic acid (EBA), 4-propylbenzoic acid (PBA), 
4-butylbenzoic acid (BBA), and 4-hexylbenzoic acid 
(HBA), which were alkyl benzoic acids with a 2-, 3-, 4-, 
and 6-carbon alkyl chain, respectively, since the 
wetting ability is supposed to be associated with the 
alkyl chain length.14 The chemical structures of 
representative EBA and BBA are shown in Fig. 1. 
Subsequent PMMA films were formed by spinning the 
PMMA-chlorobenzene solutions on the surface 
modified OTS-molds. On the other hand, the adhesion 
of PMMA films on PET substrates was strengthened by 
O2-plasma treating the PET surface.15 The flow rate of 
O2 and He gas was 2000 and 1200 sccm, while the 
frequency and the voltage of AC power supply was 600 
Hz and 10 kV, respectively. The effect of plasma 
treatment was analyzed based on the water contact 
angle of PET substrates after treatment. Besides, the 
adhesion of PMMA on PET substrate was tested in 
accordance with ASTM D3359-97. Finally, the transfer 
of PMMA films from OTS-molds to PET substrates 
were carried out by a homemade cylindrical roller with 
the diameter and length of 3 and 30 cm, respectively. 
During the flat rolling process, the rotation speed of the 
roller was around 3 rpm, meanwhile the heated (over 
130 ) roller pressed a pressure of 0.4 MPa on the ℃
PET/OTS-mold.

3. Results and Discussion 
The variation of measured water contact angle on the 
OTS-molds treated with surfactants is shown in Table I. 
As shown, the surface of untreated OTS-molds is 
highly hydrophobic due to the formation of OTS SAM, 
on which the PMMA is hardly coated. The contact 
angle is 105° (surface energy = 22 mJ/m2) on untreated 
OTS-molds and is rapidly decreased to 68.2° on those 
treated with EBA. Basically, the alkyl groups of both 
the benzoic acid and the OTS tend to attract each other 
and that causes the carboxyl groups-the polar and 
hydrophilic part of the surfactant, to regularly extend 
out of the surface normal and tightly packed due to the 
Van der Waals force. It is also clear that the surfactant 
with a shorter alkyl chain is more effective in 
decreasing the water contact angle. This phenomenon 
is presumably attributed to that a shorter alkyl chain 
tends to form the denser arrangement on OTS SAM. As

4. Conclussion 
The PMMA films with patterns of micro- and nano-
scale features such as dots, stripes, and pyramids were 
successfully transferred from surface-treated OTS-
molds to O2 plasma treated PET substrates by the 
modified roller-reversal imprint process. Surface 
treatment with alkyl benzoic acids on OTS-molds 
facilitated the conformal PMMA films, while O2 
plasma treatment on PET substrates reinforced the 
adhesion of transferred PMMA films. Whole process 
including the PMMA coating, soft baking, atmospheric 
plasma treatment of PET, and roller-reversal imprinting 
can be controlled within 20 minutes. With further 
reducing the duration time of atmospheric O2 plasma 
treatment, modified roller-reversal imprinting has 
provided the possibility toward low cost and high 
throughput, roll to roll production.
