 與運動控制系統架構及控制理論等領域
已有不少研究成果，然而與環境互動之
功能則還不斷的被研究探討，原因在於
若要與環境互動則必須整合各種感測系
統並使用各種技術對環境進行辨認或偵
測，然而現在普遍使用的紅外線或超音
波等感測器皆有諸多限制，若要讓機器
人具有一定適應性，而又無法限定環境
有特定條件或物體，因此如同人類一般
利用視覺做為感測系統是智慧型仿人型
機器人必須要走的路。 
 
 
 
三、研究目的

四、文獻探討 
仿人型及輪型機器人的技術發展與
應用近年來是非常熱門的議題，許多相關
的研究也陸續被提出，而這類機器人的目
的在於取代人力從事一些較危險、粗重的
工作，與人類達到互動的功能，進而減少
人為疏失並降低生產成本，甚至更可提高
精度上的準確性。文獻【1】中提出對一
具有雙臂之輪型機器人的阻抗控制，以達
到此機器人能夠與人類共同持取一物
體，並移動到一固定位置放置的目的；而
文獻【2-6】也提出了一些雙臂機器人的設

雙臂機器人的工作需求。 
由於機械手臂的回授控制訊號來自
各關節的旋轉角度，而其應用端為終端器
之空間位置，所以必須搭配反運動學之推
導來配合控制器運作。文獻【7,8】說明
機械手臂機構運動學推導方式，第一種方
式，是根據終端器相對於基座座標為基
礎，藉由乘上反矩陣的方式來推導獲得反
運動學方程式。此方式並未限制終端器方
向而自由度較高，但計算過程較為複雜，
空間座標解析解最多將有四組；第二種方

方向來簡化推導過程。此方式可設計終端
器與基座座標永遠保持一相對方向關
係，節省計算時間，空間座標解析解只有
一組。 
仿人型機器人之載台移動性，目前可
分為多足型，雙腳型與輪子驅動型，各有
其優缺點多足型可適應出造凹凸上平路
面之移動，為機構交複雜以及所佔投影面

惟控制難度與進入門檻高，亦上適用於過

由於包含雙臂機器人、視覺模組及控制

and error change for reducing the trial-and-error effort. It 
simplifies the designing processes and facilitates the 
implementation of a fuzzy controller. However, its complicated 
learning mechanism and 2D fuzzy rules table are still a big 
computation loading for onboard CPU system. Here, ID 
adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control strategy [9] is modified 
and improved to design the individual controller for each joint. 
A novel gain scheduling algorithm is introduced to modify this 
control algorithm for improving the overall control 
performance. It can on-line adjust the fuzzy control parameters 
in response to system transient and steady state responses 
requirement. This approach can reduce significantly the burden 
of data base and computing time for increasing the sampling 
frequency and it has learning ability to regulate the fuzzy 
control gain continuously based system output error. Here, the 
intelligent fuzzy sliding mode control strategy is implemented 
on an old Mitsubishi Movemaster RV-M2 manipulator for 
various motion control purposes.  
 
2.   SYSTEM STRUCTURE 
The retrofitted robotic control structure with Atera Nios II 
embedded SOPC development kit is shown in Fig. 1. The Nios 
II development board is designed to send digital signals to the 
Lab made DC servo motor drivers with LMD18200 IC for 
actuating each joint motor of the robotic system; and detect 
each joint motor angular position for constituting a multi inputs 
closed loop control system. User can define the micro-
processor specification under the graphic interface, integrate 
the digital logic circuits coded with Verilog, VHDL or AHDL 
hardware languages to constitute a FPGA control system. Here, 
Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) is selected to 
code the hardware circuits of this vision servo robotic control 
system. The main functions of FPGA hardware circuits are 
motor optical encoder decoding, limit switch detecting, pulse 
width modulation (PWM) generating. The functions of the 
Nios II micro-processor software programs are the 
communication with PC by using UART, robotic inverse 
kinematics calculation, robotic motion trajectory planning, and 
robotic motion control schemes. A four-bit delay filter with 
four serial D type flip-flop is designed to suppress the high 
frequency noise of the feedback signals. A 13 bits control 
signal is used to regulate the duty circle of the servo motor 
PWM signal. The robotic system is an old Mitsubishi 
Movemaster RV-M2 manipulator with a retrofitted FPGA 
control structure to substitute original commercial controller. 
The motors encoder resolutions are 740, 970, 740, 630,and 460 
pulses per degree for joint 1 to joint 5, respectively . 
 
3. TRAJECTORY PLANNING AND INVERSE 
KINEMATICS  
In order to achieve the manipulator positioning and 
trajectory tracking control in workspace, the kinematics and 
inverse kinematics and trajectory planning should be 
investigated. Generally, the end-effector working position or 
motion path in Cartesian space are converted into control 
variables in joint coordinates for controlling purpose by using 
the inverse kinematics and Denavit-Hartenberg transformation 
matrix. Although some efficient analysis methods had been 
proposed [10,11], they are time consuming and complicated 
mathematical operations. Since the most of the assembly or 
pick-and-place operations are limited on a horizontal plane on 
working space, the end-effector orientation is specified as 
orthogonal and point down to the X-Y horizontal plane. Then 
the Denavit-Hartenberg transformation matrix of end-effector 
with respect to the reference inertia coordinate is

 Based on the Mitsubishi Movemaster RV-M2 robot link 
parameters, Table 1, and forward kinematics calculation, the 
Denavit-Hartenberg transformation matrix can be derived and 
described by using the robotic D-H parameters  and ia iθ . 
The joint angle iθ  can be solved by comparing the D-H 
matrix components and some trigonometric functions 
operations based on following steps:

This approach can reduce the trigonometric functions 
calculation from 17 times to 7 comparing with that of 
traditional inverse kinematics. The computer time on the Nios 
II SOPC can be reduced from 4.5 ms to 2.5 ms for increasing 
the system closed loop frequency. For the multi-input and 
multi-output system, the motion trajectory of each joint 
corresponding to the point to point (PTP) motion in Cartesian 
space need be planned to move and stop at the same time for 
the simultaneous motion purpose. The trapezoid speed curve 
with a constant acceleration and deceleration time , a 
constant acceleration value  and the total motion time

is the most popular trajectory planning for the PTP motion.

The acceleration, acceleration time and the total motion time 
are three parameters for this trajectory planning. Since the 
motors of this 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) commercial robot 
had been appropriate designed, they can normally operate in 
this workspace. The axis with largest angular moving range is 
chosen to calculate the total motion time T  based on the

fuzzy output variable, u. 
s
The divisions of this membership functions can be 
expanded or shrunk by changing the scaling parameter of 
membership functions. The gain scheduling parameter is used 
to map the corresponding variables into this nominal range. In 
human beings’ intuition, when the joint angular error is large, 
the control voltage will be increased to provide more energy for 
driving the servo motor and reduce the angular error. On the 
other hand, when the error is approaching to the zero subset of 
membership functions, the controller should provide fine 
tuning to correct the little change of angular error and reduce 
the overshoot tendency. These two conditions can be traded off, 
by scaling the divided spans of membership functions with a 
parameter. These mapping parameters are specified as , and 
 for the sliding variable and control voltage, respectively, 
whose values are shown in Fig. 4 . The parameters values , 
,  and  for each joint are listed on Table 3. This 
approach is a novel gain scheduling 1D fuzzy sliding mode 
control structure. The values of these parameters are not critical 
for this gain scheduling fuzzy sliding mode controller. They 
can be roughly determined by simple experimental tests. Then 
the same values can be employed for different joint motion 
control with appropriate steady state accuracy. This control 
strategy can switch automatically between different scales and 
divisions of membership functions, by changing the gain 
scaling factor of membership function only.

5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In order to achieve desire motion specification and avoid 
the collision in the motion environment, the trajectory planning 
is required for the robotic motion control, and an appropriate 
controller is designed to monitor the end-effector motion 
trajectory. The multi axis manipulator is planned to execute 
point to point (PTP) motion or trajectory tracking control 
purpose in this study. The trapezoid speed curve motion 
trajectory is planned for PTP motion. Since the SOPC system is 
employed to implement this robotic servo control system, the 
control system cannot provide large computation ability for the 
model-based controller. Here, a model-free 1D fuzzy sliding 
mode controller is designed for each joint with gain scheduling 
scheme to control this Mitsubishi RV-M2 five DOF robotic 
system described in Section III. In order to evaluate the 
transient and steady sate control performances, the following 
experiments were performed. The sampling frequency in the 
experiments was 200 Hz. Since the sliding variable  is 
divided into 11 fuzzy subsets from -1 to +1 with equal interval 
0.2, a parameter  is used to regulate the sliding variables 
into that range. A parameter  was used to adjust the 
control input. The choice of these parameters is not sensitive to 
controller implementation. Their gain scheduling variation is 
designed as Fig. 4 and Table 3. If these parameters are varied 
within 50% and 200% of the original specified values, the 
control system performance is not changed significantly. In 
order to display the outstanding performance of this intelligent 
novel controller, its dynamic responses are compared with that 
of a gain scheduling self-organizing fuzzy controller.

 In order to evaluate the transient and steady state responses 
of the proposed fuzzy intelligent controllers, each joint has 
 back and forth step motion is planned.  The dynamic 
responses of each joint by using gain scheduling self-
organizing fuzzy controller(SOFC) and fuzzy sliding mode 
controller (FSMC) are shown in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively 
for comparison. It can be observed that the dynamic response 
of FSMC has overshoot less than  and steady state error 
less than . It is obviously less than the corresponding 
values,  and  of that of SOFC. In addition, the 
FSMC control strategy is employed to monitor the robot to 
move from a point to another point. The planning trajectory for 
the robotic end-effector is a trapezoid speed curve with a 
constant acceleration and deceleration for each joint, and it is 
moving from (0, 500, 200) mm to (400, 0, 300) mm in 
Cartesian space with 4 sec total motion time. The maximum 
angular acceleration of each joint is limited to . The 
motion trajectory in Cartesian space and the position error in 
each coordinate axis are shown in Fig. 6(a) and 6(b), 
respectively. The maximum angular tracking errors of each 
joint is less than . The overall position trajectory 
tracking error is less than 1.5 mm. The destination steady state 
position error is 0.03mm. Those data is obviously les than that 
of SOFC , 2.0mm and 0.1 mm. It is accurate enough for 
industrial applications.

Case (B) Trajectory tracking of end-effector moving in

 In order to evaluate the trajectory tracking control accuracy 
by using this model-free FSMC intelligent controller, one 
straight line from (400, 0, 300)mm to (350, 100, 300) mm and 
one circle with radius 60mm and center (410, 0, 400)mm in X-
Y plane of Cartesian space are planned for trajectory tracking 
experimental investigation. The position responses in Cartesian 
space and the position errors in X, Y and Z directions and 
contouring error of straight line trajectory are shown in Fig. 
7(a) and (b), respectively. The position responses in Cartesian 
space and the position errors in X, Y and Z directions and 
contouring error of circular trajectory are shown in Fig. 8(a) 
and 8(b), respectively. The maximum angular tracking errors of 
each joint is less than . The contouring tracking error in 
Cartesian space is always less than 0.5 mm except the motion 
direction change position and the position tracking error in 
each coordinate is less than 0.5mm. These data are less than 
, 1.5mm and 1 mm of that of using SOFC.

and error change for reducing the trial-and-error effort. It 
simplifies the designing processes and facilitates the 
implementation of a fuzzy controller. However, its complicated 
learning mechanism and 2D fuzzy rules table are still a big 
computation loading for onboard CPU system. Here, ID 
adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control strategy [9] is modified 
and improved to design the individual controller for each joint. 
A novel gain scheduling algorithm is introduced to modify this 
control algorithm for improving the overall control 
performance. It can on-line adjust the fuzzy control parameters 
in response to system transient and steady state responses 
requirement. This approach can reduce significantly the burden 
of data base and computing time for increasing the sampling 
frequency and it has learning ability to regulate the fuzzy 
control gain continuously based system output error. Here, the 
intelligent fuzzy sliding mode control strategy is implemented 
on an old Mitsubishi Movemaster RV-M2 manipulator for 
various motion control purposes.  
 
2.   SYSTEM STRUCTURE 
The retrofitted robotic control structure with Atera Nios II 
embedded SOPC development kit is shown in Fig. 1. The Nios 
II development board is designed to send digital signals to the 
Lab made DC servo motor drivers with LMD18200 IC for 
actuating each joint motor of the robotic system; and detect 
each joint motor angular position for constituting a multi inputs 
closed loop control system. User can define the micro-
processor specification under the graphic interface, integrate 
the digital logic circuits coded with Verilog, VHDL or AHDL 
hardware languages to constitute a FPGA control system. Here, 
Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) is selected to 
code the hardware circuits of this vision servo robotic control 
system. The main functions of FPGA hardware circuits are 
motor optical encoder decoding, limit switch detecting, pulse 
width modulation (PWM) generating. The functions of the 
Nios II micro-processor software programs are the 
communication with PC by using UART, robotic inverse 
kinematics calculation, robotic motion trajectory planning, and 
robotic motion control schemes. A four-bit delay filter with 
four serial D type flip-flop is designed to suppress the high 
frequency noise of the feedback signals. A 13 bits control 
signal is used to regulate the duty circle of the servo motor 
PWM signal. The robotic system is an old Mitsubishi 
Movemaster RV-M2 manipulator with a retrofitted FPGA 
control structure to substitute original commercial controller. 
The motors encoder resolutions are 740, 970, 740, 630,and 460 
pulses per degree for joint 1 to joint 5, respectively . 
 
3. TRAJECTORY PLANNING AND INVERSE 
KINEMATICS  
In order to achieve the manipulator positioning and 
trajectory tracking control in workspace, the kinematics and 
inverse kinematics and trajectory planning should be 
investigated. Generally, the end-effector working position or 
motion path in Cartesian space are converted into control 
variables in joint coordinates for controlling purpose by using 
the inverse kinematics and Denavit-Hartenberg transformation 
matrix. Although some efficient analysis methods had been 
proposed [10,11], they are time consuming and complicated 
mathematical operations. Since the most of the assembly or 
pick-and-place operations are limited on a horizontal plane on 
working space, the end-effector orientation is specified as 
orthogonal and point down to the X-Y horizontal plane. Then 
the Denavit-Hartenberg transformation matrix of end-effector 
with respect to the reference inertia coordinate is

 Based on the Mitsubishi Movemaster RV-M2 robot link 
parameters, Table 1, and forward kinematics calculation, the 
Denavit-Hartenberg transformation matrix can be derived and 
described by using the robotic D-H parameters  and ia iθ . 
The joint angle iθ  can be solved by comparing the D-H 
matrix components and some trigonometric functions 
operations based on following steps:

This approach can reduce the trigonometric functions 
calculation from 17 times to 7 comparing with that of 
traditional inverse kinematics. The computer time on the Nios 
II SOPC can be reduced from 4.5 ms to 2.5 ms for increasing 
the system closed loop frequency. For the multi-input and 
multi-output system, the motion trajectory of each joint 
corresponding to the point to point (PTP) motion in Cartesian 
space need be planned to move and stop at the same time for 
the simultaneous motion purpose. The trapezoid speed curve 
with a constant acceleration and deceleration time , a 
constant acceleration value  and the total motion time

is the most popular trajectory planning for the PTP motion.

The acceleration, acceleration time and the total motion time 
are three parameters for this trajectory planning. Since the

had been appropriate designed, they can normally operate in 
this workspace. The axis with largest angular moving range is

fuzzy output variable, u.

The divisions of this membership functions can be 
expanded or shrunk by changing the scaling parameter of 
membership functions. The gain scheduling parameter is used 
to map the corresponding variables into this nominal range. In 
human beings’ intuition, when the joint angular error is large, 
the control voltage will be increased to provide more energy for 
driving the servo motor and reduce the angular error. On the 
other hand, when the error is approaching to the zero subset of 
membership functions, the controller should provide fine 
tuning to correct the little change of angular error and reduce 
the overshoot tendency. These two conditions can be traded off, 
by scaling the divided spans of membership functions with a 
parameter. These mapping parameters are specified as , and 
 for the sliding variable and control voltage, respectively, 
whose values are shown in Fig. 4 . The parameters values , 
,  and  for each joint are listed on Table 3. This 
approach is a novel gain scheduling 1D fuzzy sliding mode 
control structure. The values of these parameters are not critical 
for this gain scheduling fuzzy sliding mode controller. They 
can be roughly determined by simple experimental tests. Then 
the same values can be employed for different joint motion 
control with appropriate steady state accuracy. This control 
strategy can switch automatically between different scales and 
divisions of membership functions, by changing the gain 
scaling factor of membership function only.

5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In order to achieve desire motion specification and avoid 
the collision in the motion environment, the trajectory planning 
is required for the robotic motion control, and an appropriate 
controller is designed to monitor the end-effector motion 
trajectory. The multi axis manipulator is planned to execute 
point to point (PTP) motion or trajectory tracking control 
purpose in this study. The trapezoid speed curve motion 
trajectory is planned for PTP motion. Since the SOPC system is 
employed to implement this robotic servo control system, the 
control system cannot provide large computation ability for the 
model-based controller. Here, a model-free 1D fuzzy sliding 
mode controller is designed for each joint with gain scheduling 
scheme to control this Mitsubishi RV-M2 five DOF robotic 
system described in Section III. In order to evaluate the 
transient and steady sate control performances, the following 
experiments were performed. The sampling frequency in the 
experiments was 200 Hz. Since the sliding variable  is 
divided into 11 fuzzy subsets from -1 to +1 with equal interval 
0.2, a parameter  is used to regulate the sliding variables 
into that range. A parameter  was used to adjust the 
control input. The choice of these parameters is not sensitive to 
controller implementation. Their gain scheduling variation is 
designed as Fig. 4 and Table 3. If these parameters are varied 
within 50% and 200% of the original specified values, the 
control system performance is not changed significantly. In 
order to display the outstanding performance of this intelligent 
novel controller, its dynamic responses are compared with that 
of a gain scheduling self-organizing fuzzy controller.

 In order to evaluate the transient and steady state responses 
of the proposed fuzzy intelligent controllers, each joint has 
 back and forth step motion is planned.  The dynamic 
responses of each joint by using gain scheduling self-
organizing fuzzy controller(SOFC) and fuzzy sliding mode 
controller (FSMC) are shown in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively 
for comparison. It can be observed that the dynamic response 
of FSMC has overshoot less than  and steady state error 
less than . It is obviously less than the corresponding 
values,  and  of that of SOFC. In addition, the 
FSMC control strategy is employed to monitor the robot to 
move from a point to another point. The planning trajectory for 
the robotic end-effector is a trapezoid speed curve with a 
constant acceleration and deceleration for each joint, and it is 
moving from (0, 500, 200) mm to (400, 0, 300) mm in 
Cartesian space with 4 sec total motion time. The maximum 
angular acceleration of each joint is limited to . The 
motion trajectory in Cartesian space and the position error in 
each coordinate axis are shown in Fig. 6(a) and 6(b), 
respectively. The maximum angular tracking errors of each 
joint is less than . The overall position trajectory 
tracking error is less than 1.5 mm. The destination steady state 
position error is 0.03mm. Those data is obviously les than that 
of SOFC , 2.0mm and 0.1 mm. It is accurate enough for 
industrial applications.

 In order to evaluate the trajectory tracking control accuracy 
by using this model-free FSMC intelligent controller, one 
straight line from (400, 0, 300)mm to (350, 100, 300) mm and 
one circle with radius 60mm and center (410, 0, 400)mm in X-
Y plane of Cartesian space are planned for trajectory tracking 
experimental investigation. The position responses in Cartesian 
space and the position errors in X, Y and Z directions and 
contouring error of straight line trajectory are shown in Fig. 
7(a) and (b), respectively. The position responses in Cartesian 
space and the position errors in X, Y and Z directions and 
contouring error of circular trajectory are shown in Fig. 8(a) 
and 8(b), respectively. The maximum angular tracking errors of 
each joint is less than . The contouring tracking error in 
Cartesian space is always less than 0.5 mm except the motion 
direction change position and the position tracking error in 
each coordinate is less than 0.5mm. These data are less than 
, 1.5mm and 1 mm of that of using SOFC.
