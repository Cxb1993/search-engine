To overcome this limitation, scientists attempt to 
use quantum structures such as quantum wells, quantum 
wires and quantum dots to modify the electronic bands 
in silicon. By taking advantage of quantum physics, 
indirect electronic bandgap can become direct and 
widened, and the exciton lifetime can extend in room 
temperature. Such effects make silicon promising to 
realize active components, for example, silicon 
optical amplifiers, silicon light emitting diodes, 
silicon quantum-dot detectors and silicon quantum-dot 
photovoltaic cells.  
Nevertheless, the performance is still not idea for 
fabricated devices. One of the key issues is how to 
well control the property of quantum structures, for 
example, the size and shape of quantum dots, the 
internal crystal orientation and the mesoscopic 
arrangement between dots. Therefore, in this research 
plan, we propose utilizing dipole-dipole interaction 
to manipulate the silicon nanocrystals and the 
distribution by applying electric field during the 
initial phase of crystal growth. Next, we will 
investigate the characteristics of the structured 
silicon nanocrystals and examine the influence on the 
fabricated devices such as optical amplifiers, LED 
and photovoltaic cells.

Silicon-nanocrystal resonant-cavity 
light emitting devices and color 
tailoring 
Visible photoluminescence (PL) of 
nano-structured silicon was first discovered 
by Canham in 1990 [1]. Since then, many 
attempts to achieve silicon-based light 
emitting devices through quantum confined 
nano-structures have been made extensively 
[2-5]. Strong electroluminescence of 
silicon-nanocrystal (Si-nc) light-emitting 
devices by a p-n junction or a 
metal-oxide-semiconductor structure was 
later reported [6,7]. However, the power 
conversion efficiency is relatively low, which 
makes si-nc not yet ready for practical 
lighting elements. Even though the device 
performance still can’t compete with III-V 
semiconductor, Si-nc devices receive a lot of 
attention because they can be fabricated by 
cost-effective and large-area 
microfabircation process in light of 
state-of-the-art silicon technologies. 
One possible way to enhance 
luminescence of Si-nc light emitting devices 
is incorporating optical microcavities. Such 
an idea has been widely applied for III-V 
semiconductor devices [8]. The microcavity 
can be made by distributed Bragg reflectors 
(DBR) or metal reflectors that are grown on 
the two sides of an active layer. Due to the 
resonant effect, the emission intensity is 
enhanced and the spectral bandwidth is 
narrowed with strong angular dependency. 
Similar ideas are also applied for surface 
emitting organic LED [9], where a highly 
reflective metal layer and a partial 
transmittance DBR structure were used to 
form the microcavity. 
In this study, we propose an idea to use 
microcavities for Si-nc light-emitting devices. 
The Si-nc intrinsically has broad PL emission 
bandwidth from 100 to 250 nm [7,10] due to 
homogeneous nucleation of Si-nc in the host 
dielectric matrix after high temperature 
annealing. Several groups [3,11] have 
reported enhanced emission intensity and 
narrower bandwidth of Si-nc through optical 
microcavities which were made by either 
planar or vertical DBR structures. However, 
mostresults were demonstrated by optical 
pump. 
Here, we use a semitransparent gold 
thin film and a DBR(Si/SiO2) structure 
sandwiching Si-nc active layer to realize a 
electrical-pumped resonant-cavity light 
emitting device (RCLED). Au is applied here 
since it is barely oxidized and shows 
excellent conductivity. Moreover, the optical 
absorption is relatively low at the wavelength 
larger than 550 nm. To inject current into the 
active layer, doped poly-Si is on the top DBR 
(Si/SiO2) structure. Both the gold film and 
DBR structure are employed as the cavity 
reflectors as well as the electrodes for current 
injection. Because of the broad emission 
spectrum of Si-nc, the emission color of 
fabricated devices can be tailored by fine 
tuning the cavity length and the thickness of 
Au. 
 
Device structure and fabrication  
 
FIG.1 shows the schematics of Si-nc 
RCLED. The device is composed of a top 
reflector (a semitransparent Au layer), a 
distributed Bragg reflector (a DBR structure 
made by 4 pairs of Si/SiO2) at the bottom and 
an active layer (Si-nc embedded in SiO2). 
Light is emitted from the top Au layer. The 
4-pair of Si/SiO2 DBR provides high 
reflection with broad bandwidth (>150nm) 
for the microcavity and the patterned 
aluminum ring is used as the bottom 
electrode for contacting the top of DBR 
structure

wavelength, (b) cavity mode intensity and (c) FWHM 
of Au/Si-nc:SiO2/DBR microcavity as functions of 
the Au thickness and cavity length. 
 
Meanwhile, besides the thickness of the 
Si-nc:SiO2 layer, the semitransparent Au 
reflector also has effect on the resonant 
condition. In general, the 
Au/Si-nc:SiO2/DBR cavity can be regarded 
as a Fabry-Perot cavity, and the resonant 
wavelength is determined by the equation 
[12,13]: 
2(2 ) 2 (1)cavity cavity DBR Aun L m

πλ⋅ − Φ − Φ =
where ncavity 、Lcavity and λ are the refractive 
index 、 cavity length and the emission 
wavelength, ΦDBR and ΦAu are the phase 
shifts induced by DBR and Au reflection, 
respectively, and m is an integer that defines 
the longitudinal mode number.  
FIG. 3 (a) shows the resonant 
wavelength of Au/Si-nc:SiO2/DBR as 
functions of the gold thickness and the cavity 
length. In general, the wavelength is red-shift 
as the cavity length increases. On the other 
hand, as the Au thickness increases, the 
wavelength exhibits a blue shift, resulting 
from a thickness-dependent complex 
reflection coefficient of the Au film. It is 
possible to control the resonance wavelength 
of a cavity by varying the cavity length and 
the gold thickness. The cavity mode 
intensities at a resonant wavelength versus 
different cavity lengths and Au thicknesses 
are shown in FIG. 3 (b). As the Au thickness 
increases, the mode intensity increases 
accordingly, due to strong optical reflection. 
However, above a thickness of 40 nm, the 
mode intensity tends to diminish. It can be 
explained by the metal absorption 
introducing extra cavity loss. In addition, the 
full width at half maximum (FWHM) 
bandwidth of cavity mode generally narrows 
with the Au thickness and eventually 
approaches a constant value near 15 nm. In 
this study, the Au thickness is desirably 
chosen to be 40 nm to achieve the largest 
mode intensity and narrower bandwidth. 
FIG. 4 displays the two reflectors of our 
planer cavity, and these components 
constitute the resonator sandwiched 
Si-nc:SiO2 active layer. The 4-pairs Si/SiO2 
of DBR in FIG.4 (a) was used to form both 
the total reflection mirror and the bottom 
electrode. The complex refractive index of Si

SiO2 were used in simulation tool

manufacturing optical thin film coatings. 
On the other hand, reflectance from 
DBR structure was measured by reflectance 
spectroscopy accessory (Labsphere, Inc.) 
designed for UV-VIS spectrometer 
(PerkinElmer, Inc). The reflectance spectra 
of measured and simulated results were 
around 98 ± 1%, and it has over 150nm 
 6
respectively. Due to the resonant cavity 
effect, the emission bandwidth is narrow and 
shows a colorful image. In addition to the EL 
measurement, the angle-dependent emission 
spectrum of a Si-nc RCLED was also 
examined. Because the effective cavity 
length is a function of emission angle, the EL 
spectrum actually shows a slightly blue shift. 
FIG. 7 (b) shows the angular dependence of 
EL spectra with different off-axis angles. An 
off-axis angle of 25o results in a spectral shift 
of 15 nm. In addition, the emission intensity 
was attenuated for a large off-axis angle. 
 
Conclusions 
 
In conclusion, we demonstrated Si-nc 
resonant-cavity light emitting devices. The 
microcavity consists of a Si-nc active layer 
sandwiched by a semitransparent Au 
reflector and a Si/SiO2 DBR mirror. 
Compared with the same device without the 
microcavity, the electroluminescence 
bandwidth is narrowed to be 1/8 and the peak 
intensity increases by four folds. The 
external quantum efficiency and power 
conversion efficiency also increases by 3.5 
times. Via selectively varying the thickness 
of active layer, the emission spectrum is 
tailored and shows red, orange, greenyellow 
and green colors.

The nature of indirect electronic 
bandgap in silicon limits the efficiency of 
radiative recombination emission, resulting 
in weakness of silicon to compete with III-V 
semiconductors for active optical 
components. To overcome this issue, using 
quantum structures such as Si quantum dots 
to localize the electronic and hole pairs for 
enhancing light emission has been widely 
studied. By taking advantage of localization 
effect, electronic band structures of silicon 
become quantized and behave like a direct 
bandgap material. The exciton lifetime 
extends in room temperature.

Figure 3(a) shows that the amplified

energy of 350uJ/pulse. We used the variable 
stripe length method (VSL)[12] to measure 
optical gain of si-nc embedded waveguide.

where Ispon is the spontaneous emission

waveguide, and L is the pumping length 
controlled by a shutter with a pulse laser 
beam illuminating on it. The spontaneous 
emission was measured by a spectrometer 
(Ocean Optical USB4000) with  400um 
aperature. Results  show narrower PL  
width and a slight blue shift of Si-nc 
waveguides in comparison to planar 
structrure because of waveguiding effect. 
Figure 3(b) shows that ASE intensity with 
20J/pulse and 350J/pulse pumping energy. 
For small pumping length, optical gain was 
calibrated by fitting the VSL exponential 
curve and thus the net gain is about 70±
0.5cm-1 for the two pumped energies. On the 
other hand, the optical gain decreases with 
the pumping length, resulting in saturated 
spontaneous emission.

In Figure 4(a), PL measurement of the 
2nd-order DFB Si-nc pumped by laser with 
30° incident angle is shown. This incident 
angle was chosen to avoid diffractive pump 
light directly going to the spectrometer, and 
only the emitting light was collected. As 
shown in Figure 4 (b), the DFB structure 
with a grating period of 375 nm has strong 
ASE and wavelength band narrowing, where 
the DFB PL exhibits narrowed bandwidth of 
60nm, compared with 219nm of as-deposited 
and annealed SiOx films. By considering the 
intensity enhancement, DFB devices really 
amplify the spontaneous emission with an 
enhancement factor 3.3. In addition, the peak 
(resonant wavelength) of ASE is strongly 
correlated with the grating period, which can 
be explained by the grating theory given by  
2;

 where neff is effective index of active

different peak position as shown in Figure 4 
(c).

Our main goal is to understand the 
correlation between the electrical field and 
the characteristics of Si-nc. In the future, we 
will further investigate the corresponding 
optical and electronic properties. Such a 
research is never done by other groups, but it 
may have a contribution to well control on 
the formation of Si-nc.       
                                          
Experimental Setup 
Silicon-rich oxide (SiOx) or nitride (SiNx) 
is deposited by high density plasma chemical 
vapor deposition (HDPCVD) on a silicon 
substrate with a thin oxide film on the top. 
The silicon substrate is n-type with crystal 
orientation (100). A mixture of precursor 
gases to make silicon-rich dielectric films 
were SiH4, NH3, and N2O. Tungsten was 
used as the electrode for applying voltage 
across the thin film during the post annealing 
process. The samples were then annealed 
under N2 ambient with low pressure in a 
quartz tube furnace at 1050oC for 90 min. 
The in-situ applied field setup are 
thermo-stable and can provide voltage in 
high temperature. Photoluminescence 
analysis was carried out on a HITACHI 
F-7000 fluorescence Spectrometer at room 
temperature. The crystal characterization was 
analyzed by using PANalytical X'Pert 
Pro (MRD) GIXRD scanning.  
Results and Discussion 
Figure 1(a) presents the 
photoluminescence (PL) spectra of SiNx 
layer deposited on SiO2/Si substrate with and 
without annealing, where the SiO2 layer was 
used as a buffer layer. All the samples were 
annealed at high temperature (~1050oC) for 
90min. This result shows annealed samples 
have a peak PL wavelength around 587 nm. 
In addition, it is worth to note that these two 
samples applied with electric field during 
annealing have strong photoluminescence 
intensity at 587 nm. This significant 
enhancement is possibly contributed by the 
in-situ applied electrical field. Figure 1(b) is 
the PL spectra for the samples annealed with 
electric field, where the wavelength scanning 
window spreads from 535 nm to 850 nm.  
In addition to the wavelength of 587 nm, 
there is another peak wavelength positioned 
at 711 nm.

1050oC for 90 min (a) with/without applied electrical 
field (b) have been plotted from 535nm to 850nm 
wavelength .  
 
Figure 2 presents the PL spectra of 
SiOx/Si structure, under annealing 
temperature of 1050 oC for 90min. The PL 
peak intensity is positioned at wavelengths of 
577 nm, 670 nm, and 695 nm, and is 
increased with AC signal applied. The 
consequence of enhanced PL is similar to the 
case of measured PL spectra for SiNx 
material. Therefore, we can conclude 
electrical field really affects the silicon 
nanocrystal formation during the annealing 
process.

技術說明
(中文) 本發明係關於一種多層材料之自我組裝堆疊製程方法，其係透過自我對準(self-
alignment)的方式將多種同質/異質的材料堆疊於一基板之上，該材料可以是單
晶、多晶或者是不具晶相的材料，不需要使用任何磊晶緩衝層或漸變緩衝層，除
了可降低元件結構之製程材料成本之外，亦可解決習知技術之晶圓接合技術所存
在的晶圓對準(alignment)的問題；並且，本發明之方法採用快速熔融成長(RMG)
之方式，使得多層材料以液相磊晶的方式自基板表面快速地磊晶側向成長，因此
能夠有效地降低半導體異質結構之製程熱預算(thermal budget)。
(英文) The present invention relates to a self alignment and assembly fabrication method for 
stacking multi material layers, wherein a variety of homogeneous/ heterogeneous 
materials can be stacked on a substrate through this self alignment and assembly 
fabrication method, without using any epitaxial buffer layers or gradient buffer layers; 
Moreover, these stacked materials can be single crystal, polycrystalline or non-crystalline 
phase materials. So that, not only the material cost can be effectively reduced, but the 
wafer alignment problem existing in the conventional wafer bonding process can also be 
solved. In addition, in the present invention, rapid melting growth (RMG) is used for 
growing the multi-materials laterally and rapidly from the substrate surface by liquid 
phase epitaxy, therefore the thermal budget can be largely reduced when fabricating the 
multi-layer structure.
