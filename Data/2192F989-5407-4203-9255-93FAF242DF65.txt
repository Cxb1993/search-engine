Abstract 
Structural health monitoring of concrete structures under seismic loads has 
always attracted a lot of attention in the earthquake engineering 
community. In this study, three tests of structural health monitoring of 
concrete columns using piezoceramic-based sensors are presented. The 
first test was a shake table test of a reinforced concrete (RC) column. A 
piezoceramic-based device, called “smart aggregate”, was pre-embedded 
and adopted for the structural health monitoring of the concrete column 
under earthquake excitations. The second test of this study was the on-situ 
health monitoring of RC piers of Niu-Dou Bridge in Taiwan, under 
seismic loading. RC piers instrumented with the post-embedded 
piezoceramic-based sensors were tested using reversed cyclic loading. 
During the shake table test and the on-situ reversed cyclic loading test, one 
sensor was used as an actuator to generate propagating waves, and the 
other sensors were used to detect the waves. By analyzing the wave 
response, the existence of crack can be detected and the severity can be 
estimated. The experimental results demonstrate the sensitiveness and the 
effectiveness of the piezoceramic-based approach in the structural health 
monitoring of large-scale concrete structures under earthquake loading.

parameters or other failure information of the structure. However, the impedance-
based method has been successfully implemented to the health monitoring of 
concrete structures (Ayres et al. 1998, Soh et al. 2000, Tseng and Wang 2004). 
The second approach is the wave-based health monitoring approach (Okafor et al. 
1996, Saafi and Sayyah 2001), in which the wave-propagation properties are 
studied to detect and evaluate the cracks and damages inside concrete structures. 
Wang et al. (2001) studied the debonding behaviours between steel rebar and 
concrete by using the PZT (lead zirconate titanate) patches fixed on the rebar. 
Sun et al. (2008) used the PZT patch transducer to initiate and receive the elastic 
waves in the concrete, and obtained the modulus of elasticity by utilizing the 
wave propagation characteristics. Song et al (2004, 2007, 2008) developed smart 
aggregates (SA), an innovative multifunctional piezoceramic based device, to 
perform structural health monitoring for concrete structures. The smart 
aggregates have been successfully utilized in the structural health monitoring of a 
two-story concrete frame structure (Gu et al., 2007).  
The motivation of this study comes from the following three points: (1) 
Aforementioned successful applications of health monitoring using piezoelectric 
based sensors have all been conducted by using specimens under the static 
loading condition. The piezoelectric based health monitoring of real bridges and  
concrete structures under shake table excitation has  been very seldom studied. (2) 
Most tests conducted in the laboratory rather than the test environment and test 
conditions were much better than the on-situ application of civil infrastructures. 
In addition, the size of the tested specimen is small compared with the real 
 6
columns were used to perform the structural health monitoring. For the health 
monitoring purpose, one of them was used as an actuator to generate propagating 
waves, and the others were used as sensors to detect the waves. The propagation 
energy of the waves was attenuated if cracks exist. The decreased value of the 
transmission energy is correlated with the severity of the damages. By analyzing 
the wave response, the existence of crack can be detected and the severity can be 
estimated. The experimental results demonstrate the sensitiveness and the 
effectiveness of the proposed piezoceramic-based approach in the structural 
health monitoring of the concrete structures under both the shake table excitation 
and on-situ cyclic loading. In other words, the proposed approach has been 
successfully applied to the structural health monitoring of large-scale reinforced 
concrete structures under seismic loadings.

concrete column could behave as a nearly perfect reverse curvature model so that 
the following analysis is relatively simple. The input acceleration time history for 
all shake table tests is the E-W component of the record at TCU078 station of the 
1999 Taiwan Chi-Chi earthquake (denoted as TCU078EW). Figure 3 shows the 
seismogram of the acceleration time history. Corresponding to the input ground 
motion, the test protocol is sequentially the peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 
50gal, 200gal, 400gal, 600gal, and 900gal, and the specimen failed at the test run 
of PGA=900gal. 
The concept of embedding sensors in a concrete structure is not new, 
however, in literature, most of the embedded sensors are related to corrosion 
detection. Watters et al. (2003) developed a wireless sensor called smart pebble 
to indicate chloride concentration levels. Carkhuff and Cain (2003) designed 
corrosion sensors called smart aggregates to be buried into concrete to monitor 
subsurface highway conditions in determining corrosion actions. Song et al. 
(2007) and Gu et al. (2006) designed a piezoceramic-based smart aggregate to be 
buried into concrete for multifunction applications, such as early-age strength 
monitoring and impact detection. In this test, PZT (lead zirconate titanate) type 
piezoceramic patches were embedded in one-inch cube of concrete (called smart 
aggregate). The piezoelectric strain constant 33d  and piezoelectric voltage 
constants 33g  of the PZT patches are 390x10
-12 C/N and 24 x10-3 V-m/N, 
respectively. Piezoceramic patches are very fragile and can be easily damaged by 
the vibrator during the casting of concrete structures. In order to protect the 
fragile piezoelectric transducer, the patch is first coated with insulation to prevent

Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is a commonly used damage index to 
compare the difference between the signatures of healthy state and damage state 
(Soh et al. (2000), Tseng and Naidu (2002)). In the proposed approach, the 
damage index is formed by calculating the RMSD between the energy vectors of 
the healthy state and the damaged state. The energy vector for healthy data is

The proposed damage index represents the transmission energy loss portion 
caused by damage. When the damage index is close to 0, it means that the 
concrete structure is in a healthy state. The greater the damage index, the more 
serious the damage is. A Sensor - History Damage Index Matrix (SHDIM) 
nmM × is defined as

where the matrix element at the ith  row and the jth column, jiI , , is the damage 
index of the ith smart aggregate at the time of the jth test (i.e.  i is the sensor index, 
j is the time index); m is the total number of smart aggregates and n is the total 
number of tests. The damage status at different locations at different test time of 
the concrete specimen can be revealed by a 3-dimensional damage index matrix 
plot.

the damage index matrix shown in Figure 8, the damage index values of each 
PZT sensor have monotonically increased after each test runs with different PGA 
levels, and the damage index values of S3 and S4 are larger than values of S1 and 
S2. This agrees with the severity of damage observed in the test, showing the 
effectiveness of the proposed damage index matrix to evaluate the severity of the 
damage at different locations. The average damage index matrix was calculated 
as the average damage index value of each sensor, shown in Figure 9. The 
average damage index matrix represents the health status of the whole concrete 
column.

Chapter 3 On-Situ test of Niu-Dou Bridge 
3.1 Experimental setup 
National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) 
conducted an on-situ bridge test of the Niu-Dou Bridge in Yi-Lan, Taiwan, on 
December 2010 to study the seismic performance of the bridge piers. The bridge 
piers were tested under the reversed cyclic loading in order to study their seismic 
performance. The post embedded PZT sensors was used for the structural health 
monitoring during the test. The right-lane and left-lane of Niu-Dou Bridge were 
constructed at 1963 and 1995, respectively. The tested RC structures, as shown in 
Figure 10, were two pier columns with circular cross section, numbered P3 and 
P4 in the left-lane of the bridge. The height and diameter of columns are 1030cm 
and 180cm, respectively. The longitudinal steel bars of the column are 32-#10, 
and the stirrups are #5 at 20cm. The sub-structure of right lane of the bridge is a 
pier wall structure. By utilizing the high stiffness and strength properties of the 
pier wall, the pier wall was stiffened with steel frames and used as the reaction 
structure of the reversed cyclic loading test of the pier columns. Figure 11 shows 
the setup for pier P3 of the test. A reference frame was installed on the right hand 
side of the tested column to measure the drift of the column. Reversed cyclic 
loading test was conducted with an increasing of 0.5% drift ratio at every step for 
drift ratio less than 3.0%, and finally push the pier from 3.0% drift directly to the 
targeted 5.0% drift. 
 20
3.2 Experimental results of test  
The test procedures and results of pier P3 and pier P4 are very similar and 
both have the same size and reinforcement. However, one sensor embedded in 
the pier P4 broke down during the test. Therefore, only the test results of pier P3 
were presented in this report. Figure 14 shows the cracking pattern and failure 
mode of pier P3 at different drift ratios. Table 2 summarized the damage states 
under different drift ratios. The hysteretic loops (force-displacement relationships) 
of pier P3 shown in Figure 15 demonstrate the pier column as flexural controlled 
failure, and the maximum column shear capacity is about 1000 kN (Chang, 2011).  
 Because excitation waves are single frequency sine waves, the variation 
of the Fourier amplitude of received signals can also reflect the severity of 
damage as the damage index defined in Eq. (4). It is also very interesting to 
observe the transmission energy loss caused by damage. Figure 16 presents the 
Fourier amplitudes of sensor voltage measured by sensor S1 under the excitation 
of actuator A2 with frequency 100 Hz. The Fourier amplitudes around the 
excitation frequency obviously decreased as the drift ratio increased, meaning 
that the propagation energy of the waves has been attenuated by the presence of 
damages. Figures 17 to 20 show the damage indices calculated based on Eq. (4) 
using the received voltages of the sensors under the excitation of actuators A1 
and A2 with different frequencies. The sensors PZT-S1, -S2, -S3, -S4 are 
numbered from 1 to 4 in these figures. It can be observed from these figures, 
except the results of sensors 3 and 4 at excitation frequencies 1 kHz and 5 kHz, 
most of the damage indexes calculated from sensor voltages can actually reflect

White noise excitations were also applied to these tested structures before and 
after the earthquake excitation from the shaking table. The first fundamental 
frequency of the frame before test in longitudinal direction was about 6.0 Hz for 
specimens RCF1 and RCF2, and 5.1 Hz for specimen RCF3. After the shake 
table test, the fundamental frequency of frames RCF1, RCF2 and RCF3 was 3.0, 
2.4 and 2.0 Hz, respectively.  
The concept of embedding sensors in a concrete structure is not new, 
however, in the literature, most of the embedded sensors are related to corrosion 
detection. Watters et al. (2003) developed a wireless sensor called smart pebble 
to indicate chloride concentration levels. Carkhuff and Cain (2003) designed 
corrosion sensors called smart aggregates to be buried into the concrete to 
monitor subsurface highway conditions in determining corrosion actions. Song et 
al. (2007) and Gu et al. (2006) designed a piezoceramic-based smart aggregate to 
be buried into the concrete for multifunction applications, such as early-age 
strength monitoring, impact detection and structural health monitoring.  
The smart aggregates are embedded at the predetermined distributed 
locations before casting.  Figure 23 shows the embedded locations of smart 
aggregates in the tested specimens. A total number of 6 smart aggregates were 
fixed with the rebar cage at predetermined locations before casting of the 
concrete structure. As expected, the most damaged regions of the tested frame 
structure were the plastic hinge zones at two ends of columns and beams. The 
smart aggregates in the columns and beams were used as sensors, and smart 
aggregates in the foundation were used as actuator. From the arrangement of the 
sensors and actuator as shown in Figure 23, the sensors located in the middle 
height of columns (S1-S3) can be used to monitor the health status of the bottom 
region of columns, and the monitoring by sensors located in the middle span of 
beams (S4 and S5) can be seem as the health status of the whole frame. The

index matrix to evaluate the severity of the damage at different frames.  
 
4.3 SIMULATION OF THE NONLINEAR BEHAVIORS OF FRAMES 
A finite element model was established by using SAP2000 for the simulation 
of the dynamic behavior of the RC frame structure when subjected to different 
levels of earthquake ground excitations. In the simulated model of the RC frame, 
the beam and column were modeled as the linear elastic element with nonlinear 
links at both ends of the element; the cracking moment, yielding moment, 
ultimate moment strength and corresponding curvatures of the cross section were 
obtained by the moment-curvature method. The specimens were designed by 
flexural governed, therefore, the existing concrete modules developed by Park 
and Priestley (1982) and the bilinear steel modulewere used to define the 
concrete fibers and steel fibers in the cross section. The hysteretic model 
assigned in the nonlinear link for the analysis is the Takada model prepared in 
the SAP2000. As shown in Table 3, the identified fundamental frequencies of 
specimens before and after test run were quite different due to the presence of 
cracks, and the stiffness of simulated element can not varied for reflecting this 
phenomenon during analysis. Therefore, for capture the vibration characteristics 
of the tested specimens, an effective moment of inertia should be assigned in the 
elements for archive the characteristic. In this study, the effective moment of 
inertia of the elements adopted is the average value of the cracked and un-
cracked moment of inertia. This approach is simple and accurate for the 
simulation of the responses of the tested frames when subjected to earthquake 
excitations.  
Figures 28-31 show the simulated displacement time histories at the slab of 
the test RC frames and in comparison with those results measured in the test. 
From these figures, it was shown that the simulated method proposed in this

 Conclusions 
 
In this report, a piezoelectric based sensor system was developed for the 
structural health monitoring of concrete columns under seismic loadings. From 
the experimental results of shake table test and the on-situ cyclic loading test, the 
damage indices obtained by proposed sensing system increased as the damage 
level became severe, and the damage indices have the same increasing trend as 
the drift ratio of the tested specimens. The health monitoring approach can 
monitor and predict the health status of the tested specimens through the 
proposed damage index matrix. Although the sensitivity limit and resolution of 
the piezoelectric based sensor may be affected by the propagation distance of 
excitation wave during the on-situ bridge test, the test results show the proposed 
damage indices can reflect the damage status of a large-scale concrete structure 
under seismic loading. The effectiveness of the piezoceramic based approach for 
a large-scale concrete structure has been verified by the on-situ bridge test. 
Therefore, the piezoelectric based sensor system has the potential to be 
implemented to the health-monitoring of other large scale concrete structures.

Keywords: health monitoring, piezoceramic, smart aggregate, shake table 
Abstract. Structural health monitoring of RC structures under seismic loads has recently attracted 
attention in the earthquake engineering research. In this paper, a piezoceramic-based device called 
“smart aggregate” was used for the health monitoring of RC frame structures under earthquake 
excitations. A two-story one-bay RC moment frame instrumented with smart aggregates was tested 
using a shake table. The distributed piezoceramic-based smart aggregates embedded in the RC 
structures were used to monitor the health condition of the structures during the tests. The 
sensitiveness and effectiveness of the proposed piezoceramic-based approach were investigated and 
evaluated by analyzing the measured responses.  
Introduction 
Concrete structures are the most popular civil structures. Concrete infrastructures, such as bridges, 
play an important role not only in a nation’s transportation system but also in a nation’s economy. 
Throughout the life cycle of a concrete structure, many importantly issues have to be addressed 
properly to ensure the safe operation of these structures. During its service, it is important to perform 
structural health monitoring detect the damage status and structure health status after earthquake or 
impact. In recent years, piezoelectric materials have been successfully applied to the structural health 
monitoring of concrete structures due to their advantages of active sensing, low cost, quick response, 
availability in different shapes, and simplicity for implementation. There are two major categories of 
piezoelectric-based health monitoring: 1) The impedance-based approach, in which the impedance of 
piezoelectric transducers can be applied to the health monitoring of concrete structures [1-3], and 2) 
Vibration-based health monitoring approach, in which the wave-propagation properties are studied to 
detect and evaluate the cracks and damages inside the concrete structures [4-6].  
In this paper, piezoelectric based-smart aggregates were adopted to perform structural health 
monitoring for concrete structures after earthquake excitation. A two-story one-bay reinforced 
concrete frame structure with embedded smart aggregates is used as the testing object. A shake table 
is used to simulate the earthquake ground motion for the testing object. The ground motion record 
TCU078 from 1999 Taiwan earthquake was used as the excitation source for the shake table under 
different acceleration levels. The acceleration level was increased incrementally until the failure of 
the concrete frame. During the shake table tests, the distributed piezoceramic-based smart aggregates 
embedded in the concrete column are used to perform the structural health monitoring. For the health 
monitoring purpose, one smart aggregate is used as an actuator to generate propagating waves, and the 
other smart aggregates are used as sensors to detect the waves. The propagation energy of the waves 
will be attenuated if cracks exist. The decreased value of the transmission energy is correlated with the 
severity of damages. By analyzing the wave response, the existence of crack can be detected and the 
severity can be estimated. The results demonstrate the sensitiveness and the effectiveness of the 
proposed piezoceramic-based approach in the structural health monitoring of the concrete structure 
under earthquake loading. The proposed approach has the potential to be applied to the structural 
health monitoring of large-scale reinforced concrete structures under seismic excitations.

where 0t  is the starting time, ft  is the finish time, and u  is the sensor voltage. The energy vector 
for the healthy data is hE . The energy vector for the damage status at time index i is defined as iE . The

The proposed damage index represents the transmission energy loss caused by damage. When the 
damage index is close to 0, it means the structure is in a healthy state. When the damage index is 
greater than a certain threshold, it means damage has appeared. In this case, the greater the index, the 
more serious the damage is. When the damage index is very close to 1, it means the concrete structure 
is near failure.  
Fig. 5 and Fig 6 show the cracking pattern and failure mode at beam-column joint of specimen after 
different PGA level test runs. The cracking of the concrete was drawn on the white painted faces of 
the specimen during the tests. After the shake table tests, the smart aggregates were utilized for the 
structural health monitoring of the concrete frame. The PZT-25 shown in Fig. 4 behaved as an 
actuator excited by a sweep sine wave with frequency range from 100 Hz and 1 kHz. Sensors PZT-10 
and PZT-29 located in the beams of first and second floor behaved as sensors. The responded voltage 
time histories of sensor PZT-10 are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from this figure, the voltage is 
decreased as the PGA level is increased. The damage index proposed was utilized in the structural 
health monitoring of tested RC frame. The damage indices of sensors are shown in Fig. 8. The sensor 
numbers are as according to the description of Fig. 4. From the damage indices shown in figure, the 
PZT-sensor is very sensitive to the cracking pattern of concrete, and the damage index values of each 
PZT sensor have an increased trend that related to the excitation PGA level. This shows the 
effectiveness of the proposed damage index to evaluate the severity of the damage at different parts of 
the frame.
