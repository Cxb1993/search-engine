Recent years electrochromism have been extensively investigated due to their potential 
applications such as smart window of architecture and automobile glazing to save energy and 
modulate the transmission of light and solar radiation. Therefore, the objective of this study is to 
investigate the effects of sputtering conditions on the composition, microstructure, 
electrochromic properties of tungsten oxide films prepared by d.c. reactive magnetron 
sputtering. 
Experimental results indicated that with increasing oxygen flow rate, oxygen content of the 
film was increased. For high oxygen flow rate, tungsten oxide films showed good reversibility. 
At the oxygen flow rate of 30sccm, the transmission change between colored and bleached 
states at a wavelength of 550nm was 61.4%. The film obtained high optical density, and 
coloration efficiency was 7.79cm2/C. It was also found that the crystallinity of films was 
obtained at the substrate temperature larger than 300?. As the substrate temperature increasing 
from room temperature to 350?, the optical band gap changed from 3.64 to 3.08eV due to the 
existence of oxygen vacancies or larger grain size. The crystalline tungsten oxide films show 
high reflectance in the near IR region. The reproducibility and the transmission of colored and 
bleached state were not affected after 100 cycles. It means the tungsten oxide films deposited by 
d.c. reactive magnetron sputtering had good quality stability which is important for application 
in smart window.
