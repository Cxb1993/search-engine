Abstract
This project considers the use of the partial transmit sequence (PTS) technique to reduce
the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of an orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing (OFDM) signal. The conventional PTS technique can provide good PAPR reduction
performance for OFDM signals; however, it requires an exhaustive search over all com-
binations of allowed phase factors, resulting in high complexity. In order to reduce the
complexity while still improving the PAPR statistics of an OFDM signal, a new method
using the Cross-Entropy (CE) method is proposed to reduce both the PAPR and the
computational load. In the proposed CE method, we first define the amount of PAPR as
the score function. The score function is then translated into a stochastic approximation
problem which can be solved effectively. Simulation results show that the performance
of the proposed CE method provides almost the same PAPR reduction as that of the
conventional exhaustive search algorithm while maintaining low complexity.
Keywords: Cross-entropy method, orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing, partial transmit sequence, peak-to-average power ratio.

1. 緣由與目的
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is an attractive technique for
achieving high-bit-rate wireless data communication [1]. It has been applied extensively to
digital transmission, such as in wireless local area networks and digital video/audio broad-
casting systems. Moreover, it has been regarded as a promising transmission technique
for fourth-generation wireless mobile communications. However, due to its multicarrier
nature, the major drawback of the OFDM system is the high peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR), which may cause high out-of-band radiation when the OFDM signal is passed
through a radio frequency power amplifier. Consequently, the high PAPR is one of the
most important implementation challenges that face designers of OFDM.
Various methods for PAPR reduction have been proposed in the literature [2]-[6] to
avoid the occurrence of high PAPR of OFDM signals. Among these methods, the partial
transmit sequence (PTS) technique [6] is the most attractive scheme because of good
PAPR reduction performance and no restrictions to the number of the subcarriers. In the
PTS scheme, the input data is divided into smaller disjoint subblocks. Each subblock is
multiplied by rotating phase factors. The subblocks are then added to form the OFDM
symbol for transmission. The objective of the PTS scheme is to design an optimal phase
factor for a subblock set that minimizes the PAPR.
The PTS technique significantly reduces the PAPR, but unfortunately, finding the
optimal phase factors is a highly complex problem. In order to reduce the search com-
plexity, the selection of the phase factors is limited to a set of finite number of elements.
The exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) is then employed to find the best phase factor.
However, the ESA requires an exhaustive search over all combinations of the allowed
phase factors and has exponential search complexity with the number of subblocks.
To reduce the computational complexity, some simplified search techniques have re-
cently been proposed [7]-[9], such as the iterative flipping algorithm (IFA) [9]. Although
the IFA significantly reduces the search complexity, there is some gap between its PAPR
reduction performance and that of the ESA. In general, for all these search methods, ei-
ther the PAPR reduction is suboptimal or the complexity is still high. In this project, we
consider using the PTS technique to reduce the PAPR of the OFDM signals and propose
a novel implementation of the PTS technique to reduce the PAPR based on the Cross-
Entropy (CE) method [10]. In the proposed CE method, we first define the amount of
the PAPR as the score function. The score function is then translated into a stochastic
approximation problem which can be solved effectively. The simulation results show that
the performance of the proposed CE method provides almost the same PAPR reduction
as that of the ESA while maintaining low complexity.

using the N -point inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Since the IFFT is a linear
transformation, the representation of the block in time domain is given by
x = IFFT
{
M∑
m=1
Xm
}
=
M∑
m=1
IFFT {Xm} ,
M∑
m=1
xm. (2.4)
Then, the time domain sequences are combined with complex phase factors b = [b1 · · · bM ]T
to minimize the PAPR. That is, the PAPR is reduced by the weighted combination of M
subblocks. The resulting time domain signal after combination is given by
x′(b) =
M∑
m=1
bm · xm. (2.5)
The allowable phase factors are
bm = e
jφm , (2.6)
where φm can be chosen freely within [0, 2pi). For convenience, (2.5) can be expressed as
x′(Φ) =
M∑
m=1
ejφm · xm, (2.7)
where Φ = [φ1 φ2 · · · φM ]T . Hence, the objective of the PTS scheme is to design an
optimal phase factor for the subblock set that minimizes the PAPR. Thus, the minimum
PAPR with the PTS technique is related to the problem
minimize max |x′(Φ)|
subject to 0 ≤ φm ≤ 2pi, m = 1, 2, . . . ,M. (2.8)
It is obvious that finding a best phase factor set is a complex and difficult problem;
therefore, in the next section, we propose a novel implementation of the PTS scheme
based on the CE method.

are the mean and variance, respectively. It is important to emphasize that the sampling
distribution can be quite arbitrary and does not need to be related to the function that is
being optimized. The reason we adopt the Gaussian distribution is that it gives formulas
that are easy to update.
At each l iteration of the algorithm, a collection ofK random samples
{{
φ
(l)
m (k)
}M
m=1
}K
k=1
is obtained from a Gaussian distribution, i.e., φ
(l)
m (k) ∼ N

, where φ
(l)
m (k) de-
notes mth the element of the sample k at iteration l, and α
(l)
m and β
(l)
m denote the mean and
the variance of the mth element at iteration l , respectively. Next, with the K samples,
we can derive a set of performance values
{
L
(
Φ(l)(k)
)}K
k=1
using the score L(Φ) function
expressed in (3.2). After sorting the performance values from the smallest to the largest,
L(1) ≤ · · · ≤ L(K), we select the best few of the performance values that exceed a certain
level to update new values α
(l)
m and β
(l)
m . That is, α
(l)
m and β
(l)
m are updated via the sample
mean and sample standard deviation of a fixed number of the best performance samples,
the so-called elite samples Kelite = dρKe, where ρ denotes the fraction of the best samples
and dρKe is the integer part of ρK. Let χ be the indices of the Kelite best performance
samples. Then α
(l)
m and β
(l)
m can be updated via
α˜(l)m =
∑
k∈χ

(3.4)
and
β˜(l)m =
∑
k∈χ
(

)2
Kelite
(3.5)
respectively. That is, we update α
(l)
m and β
(l)
m as the mean and variance of the elite samples.
In addition, instead of using α˜
(l)
m and β˜
(l)
m as the updated parameters, it is beneficial to
add a smoothing procedure for each iteration l as
α(l)m = γα˜
(l)
m + (1− γ)α(l−1)m (3.6)
and
β(l)m = γβ˜
(l)
m + (1− γ)β(l−1)m (3.7)
where γ is the smoothing parameter, with 0 < γ ≤ 1. It is obvious that for γ = 1, we
have the original updating rule. The main algorithm is summarized as follows:

Computer simulations are discussed in this section. The simulation parameters are
as follows. We consider an OFDM system with 64 subcarriers and 128 subcarriers with
QPSK data symbols. In the first case, the 64 subcarriers are divided into 8 subblocks
consisting of 8 subcarriers with 4 times oversampling. In the second case, the 128 sub-
carries are divided into 8 subblocks consisting of 16 subcarriers with 4 times oversampling.
In order to generate the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the
PAPR, 10,000 OFDM blocks are generated randomly. Regarding the parameters used
in the proposed CE algorithm, a
(0)
m is randomly chosen over [0, 2pi), b
(0)
m is 10,000, the
smoothing parameter γ is 0.8, Kelite = 25, K = 200, and the algorithm is stopped when
the iteration number exceeds the predetermined value Iter.

Figure 4.1: CCDFs of the PAPR for various PTS techniques, with N = 64, M = 8,
QPSK modulation, and 4 times oversampling.
For comparison, we also test 1) the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm [11] to find
suitable phase coefficients for the PTS scheme; 2) the ESA [6] to search the optimal
combination of phase factors. Fig. 4.1 shows the CCDFs for the PTS technique with the
ESA, the PTS technique with the SA algorithm, the PTS technique with the proposed
OCE and MCE algorithms, and the original OFDM, which is obtained directly from
the output of IFFT operation for N = 64 subcarriers and M = 8 subblocks. In the
ESA, four allowed phase factors +1, −1, +j, −j (W = 4) are used, and the PAPR
reduction performance is obtained by a Monte Carlo search with a full enumeration of
WM (48 = 65, 536) phase factors. The 10−3 PAPR of the original OFDM signal is 10.67
dB, indicating a large PAPR. The 10−3 PAPR of the SA algorithm with enumeration
=1000 is 6.38 dB. It is evident that the SA algorithm can provide the better PAPR
reduction. However, when the proposed MCE method with maximum iteration value

5. 結論
This project presented a CE-based method that was used to obtain the optimal phase
factor for the PTS technique to reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals. We formulated the
phase factor searching of the PTS technique as a stochastic approximation problem, and
we applied the CE method to search the optimal phase factor. Simulations were conducted
and show that the performance of the proposed CE method provides almost the same
PAPR reduction as that of the conventional ESA while maintaining low computational
load.
