 of a nonexpansive mapping T with 
respect to a nonexpansive mapping P, namely 
 
In particular, if we take P=0 then HIV is 
reduced to the minimum norm problem of fixed 
point set of T, that is, a quadratic minimization 
problem over fixed point set.  
 
It is not difficult to check that solving HVI is 
equivalent to the hierarchically fixed point problem 
(HFPP) 
 
where  stands for the metric projection 
on the closed convex set Fix(T). By using the 
definition of the normal cone to Fix(T), i.e. 
 
we easily can prove that (HIV) is equivalent to 
the zero of following generalized equation 
 
At this point, we wish to point out the link with 
some monotone variational inequalities and 
convex programming problems as follows: 
(1) P is a constant mapping on C, HIV is 
equivalent to finding the fixed point of T closest 
to =u; that is, 
 
(2) Setting P = I −  γF, where F is η
-Lipschitzian and k-strongly monotone with γ 
∈ (0, 2k/η 2]. Then HIV is reduced to 
following variational inequality studied in [1], 
 
(3) Let A be a maximal monotone operator. 
Taking T =  and P = I −γ∇
ψ, where ψ is a convex function such that ∇
ψ is η-Lipschitzian (which is equivalent to 
the fact that ∇ψ is η−1 co-coercive) with γ 
∈ (0, 2/η], and . Then HVI 
reduces to the following mathematical program 
with generalized equation constraint (MPEC) 
considered in [2]: 
 
(4) Specially, taking A = ∂ϕ, where ∂ϕ is 
the subdifferential of a lower semicontinuous 
convex function. Then (MPEC) reduces to the 
following hierarchical (two-level) minimization 
problem considered in [3] and [4]: 
 
Thus we can find that this kind of problems 
cover many important problems in literature. 
Numerical algorithms solving HIV is very 
difficult (see [11]) then find a suitable iterative 
algorithm is valuable. Recently, hierarchical 
fixed point problems and hierarchical 
minimization problems have attracted many 
authors’ attention due to their link with some 
convex programming problems. 
三、研究背景 
In order to achieve the purpose of the research, 
in this section we will follow the following 
background. The project will propose two 
iterative algorithms, implicit Korpelevich’s 
extragradient method and new hybrid method, as 
well as revise Krasnoselski–Mann method under 
weaker conditions to solve HFPP and HIV 
respectively. 
In order to solve the hierarchical fixed 
point problem HFFP, Moudafi [15] introduced 
the following Krasnoselski–Mann’s algorithm: 
 
where  and  are two real numbers in 
(0,1). It is worth mentioning that some 
algorithms in signal processing and image 
reconstruction may be written as the wellknown 
Krasnoselski–Mann (KM) iteration and that the 
main feature of its corresponding convergence

Lemma 5 ([18]). Let C be a nonempty closed

let  . . . be real numbers such that

Theorem M ([15]). Let C be a nonempty closed 
convex subset of a real Hilbert space H. Let P 
and T be two nonexpansive mappings of C into 
itself such that Fix(T)= ∅. Let {αn} and {σn} 
be two real numbers in (0,1) satisfying the 
following conditions: 
 
In theorem M, the author has imposed three 
conditions (i)–(iii) on the iterative parameters. 
At the same time, we note that the author only 
obtained a weak convergence result. After 
carefully reading the above result, we find that 
condition (ii) is superfluous. Moreover, we can 
weaken condition (i) and we prove a strong 
convergence result under different restrictions 
on parameters for solving problem (HFPP) when 
P is a contraction, a special case of 
nonexpansive mappings. 
四、研究內容 
In this section, we first give some preliminaries 
that will be used in the rest of this project then 
we will illustrate our main results based on 
them. 
Now we state and prove our main results 
for HFPP and HIV as follows: 
Theorem 1. Let C be a nonempty closed convex 
subset of a real Hilbert space H. Let P and T be 
two nonexpansive mappings of C into itself such 
that Fix(T) = ∅ . Let {xn} be a sequence 
generated by KM algorithm. Let {αn} and {σ
n} be two real numbers in (0,1) satisfying the 
following conditions: 
 
Then 
(i) {xn} weakly converges to a fixed point of T; 
(ii) {xn} is asymptotically regular, namely 
; 
(iii){xn} converges weakly to a solution of 
problem (HFPP). 
 
By the same argument as that in the proof of 
theorem 1, we can easily prove the following 
result. 
Theorem 2. Let C be a nonempty closed convex 
subset of a real Hilbert space H. Let P and T be 
7 
generated by the implicit extragradient method 
converges in norm, as t → 0+, to the unique 
solution z of the hierarchical variational 
inequality HVI(C,A, f). In particular, if one 
takes that f = 0, then the net {xt} defined by (3.2) 
converges in norm, as t →  0+, to the 
minimum-norm solution of the variational 
inequality VI(C,A). 
Motivated by recent work in the literature, 
the purpose of this project is to introduce two 
new iterative algorithms as well as revise and 
improve KM algorithm under weaker conditions. 
Our results studied in the project can be viewed 
as a refinement and modification of many results 
in the literature. Under the support of this NSC 
project, we have publish more than 15 high 
quality papers in SCIe journals.

Some New Results for Iterative Algorithms and 
Its Applications*
Introduction (1/2)
• Two level problem often involves many kinds of optimization 
problems, such as two-level optimization, mathematical programs 
with equilibrium constraints (MPEC in short), generalized game 
problem, etc..
• In order to solve the two-level problem, we consider the 
following two-level variational inequality problem with two 
nonexpansive mappings S and T
