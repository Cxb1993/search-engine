1reaction (PCR) or oligonucleotide synthesis. Thus, aptamer chips are not only like antibody chips
in function but also as stable as gene chips. Therefore, applications of such an antibody-mimic
chip for in vitro diagnostics (IVD) are visible. In this project, we aim at modifying DNA aptamers
to photoaptamers for the microarray-based differential protein expression profiling. The halogen
base, such as 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU), inside a photoaptamer molecule can be activated
by UV irradiation and then form a stable covalent bond with the target protein. This process is
called photocrosslinking. After photocrosslinking, chips can stand for highly stringent, even
denatured, wash conditions and thus greatly reduce background contamination. However, the
screening process of photoaptamers, namely PhotoSELEX, is much more complicated than a
typical SELEX process. Besides, almost all aptamers discovered to date are lack of the ability of
photocrosslinking. As a result, finding an appropriate way to directly“upgrade”normal aptamers
to photoaptamers could be very helpful for the microarray-based differential protein expression
profiling and thus serves as the core of this project.
三、研究目的 Objectives
(1) To compare different strategies for upgrading an ordinary DNA aptamer to a photoaptamer
by modifying sequences with a functional nucleotide 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine, BrdU;
(2) To investigate the influences of BrdU modification on both specificity and affinity of an
aptamer probe to a specific protein target;
(3) To study the effect of UV-crosslinking between a photoaptamer and a protein target on the
microarray signal intensity after highly stringent washes;
(4) To evaluate the possibility and application of photoaptamer microarrays for differential
protein expression profiling.
四、文獻探討 Literature Survey
DNA aptamers that have been demonstrated to be an emerging class of molecules that rival
antibodies in both diagnostics [1] and therapeutics [2]. Such antibody rivals share the same
structural stability as DNA molecules and therefore promise a sensor array that can be stored and
manipulated for a wide temperature range. Also, aptamers against a variety of targets, from small
molecules to large proteins, have been screened in vitro since the early 1990s. Comprehensive
sequence information on aptamers is publicly available at http://apatmer.icmb.utexas.edu/, an
aptamer database established by the Ellington group in UT Austin [3]. In addition to structural
stability, aptamers can further provide some advantages that antibodies could not. First, in vitro
selection of aptamers (SELEX) is a process faster and easier than the production of monoclonal
antibodies. Moreover, once the sequence of an aptamer is identified, mass production of such an
oligonucleotide-based ligand can be achieved readily by either chemical synthesis or PCR
amplification without re-performing the SELEX process. Second, synthetic aptamers are facile to
modify chemically to increase functionality without losing their target-recognizing ability. For
3microarrays. Spot size ranged from 100 to 250 um. Post-printing treatments were done followed
vendor’s instructions. To check slide’s printing quality, 30-min labeling at room temperature with
the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) mix containing Cy3-dUTP was performed, and
the fluorescent signals were collected with the GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon).
Human-thrombin, Taq polymerase, and KlenTaq polymerase were purchased from Sigma,
and the fractionated proteins were obtained from the B-PER extraction of the 37 oC overnight
cultures of E. coli K12 followed by anion-exchange chromatography fractionation. Before
labeling protein with NHS-CyDye reagents (GE Amersham), protein samples were diafiltrated
against 0.1M NaHCO3, pH 9.4 twice using Microcon YM-10 tubes (Millipore) or Centri-Sep
columns (Princeton). Coupling reaction between NHS-Cy3 or NHS-Cy5 and protein/NaHCO3
solution was performed at room temperature for 30 min with mixing. The reacted mixtures were
diafiltrated against the selection buffer twice using Microcon YM-10 or Centri-Sep tubes to
remove free dyes. Prior to hybridization, printed slides were blocked according to vendor’s 
instruction manual. Desired amounts of CyDye-labeled protein samples with appropriate
blocking additives were hybridized to aptamer microarrays and incubated at either room
temperature or 37 oC for 1 hour. For photocrosslinking between BrdU-modified aptamers and
protein targets, the microarrays were exposed to 312 nm UV light before washes. The
post-hybridized slide was briefly rinsed with PBS and then washed with PBST, pH7.4 or 2x SSC,
1% SDS for 10 to 20 min at room temperature three times. After a final brief rinse with Q-water,
the slide was spun dry and then scanned by the GenePix microarray scanner.
六、結果與討論 Results and Discussions
In this project, we first compared different BrdU-doping strategies that might modify known
aptamers to photoaptamers with UV-crosslinking functionality. To this end, the well-studied
anti-human -thrombin aptamers served as the model ligands for modification and were
investigated. We focused on two anti-thrombin DNA aptamers named HT3 (29mer, Kd = 0.5 nM)
and HT5 (15mer, Kd = 1.4-6.2 nM) that were reported to recognize different epitopes of thrombin.
The following BrdU-doping strategies were adopted: (1) direct use BrdU (5-bromo-2’-deoxy-
uridine) in substitution for dT (2’-deoxythymidine) in an aptamer sequence (HT3  HT3U); (2)
addition of 5-mer BrdU tail at the 3’ position of an aptamer (HT3  HT3-5U); (3) addition of
15-mer BrdU tail at the 3’position of an aptamer (HT3  HT3-15U). Both unmodified and
BrdU-doped aptamer probes (with 5’amino linker) were arrayed in triplicate on epoxide-coated
slides to fabricate photoaptamer chips that would be used to hybridize and UV-induced crosslink
fluorescently labeled protein targets. Figure 1 compares the laser-scan results of Cy3-labeled and
Cy5-labeled thrombin. It is observed that the BrdU-doped aptamer probes, in general, feature
brighter fluorescent signals than unmodified probes (HT3 and HT5). Moreover, signals shown on
the BrdU-doped probes did not disappear after 2xSSC, 1% SDS washes. Presumably, this is
5such an effect. Also, both BrdU substitution (HTxU and HTxu) and addition (HTx-5U and
HTx-15U) greatly increases the fluorescent signals for the protein detection by aptamer chips.
The thrombin detection limit could approach pg range.
In addition to comparing different BrdU doping strategies that upgrade non-photoSELEX
aptamers to photoaptamers, we investigated the application of a photoaptamer chip for dual-color,
differential protein expression profiling. Relevant data are collected in Fig. 3. Figures 3(A) is the
microarray image for the detection of a mixture of Cy3-labeled thrombin and Cy5-labeled Taq
polymerase. Figure 3 (B) is a result of the detection of a mixture of Cy3-labeled Taq polymerase
and Cy5-labeled KlenTaq recombinant polymerase. Both Fig. 3(A) and Fig. 3(B) imply failure in
detection of Cy3-labeled Taq polymerase. But, Fig. 3(A) suggests that non-reactive proteins can
serve as blocking reagents to increase the contrast of fluorescent signals on (anti-thrombin)
photoaptamer probes. For the detection of Cy5-KlenTaq (see Fig. 3(B)), the following two results,
different from the thrombin case, are disclosed: (i) direct BrdU substitution, which may alter
DNA structure, is not working for anti-Taq aptamer (reference to TQ1U and TQ2U); (ii) addition
of 15-mer BrdU tail could lead to contamination (reference to HT3-15U and HT5-15U) and may
thus reduce the specificity of an aptamer. Accordingly, the better aptamer-upgrading strategies
could be 50% random BrdU incorporation and addition of a BrdU tail shorter than 5mer.
