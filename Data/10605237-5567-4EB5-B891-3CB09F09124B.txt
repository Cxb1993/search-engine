deposited at a fix rf power of 300W, a 
deposition pressure of 5mTorr, a substrate 
temperature of 450oC and a argon-oxygen 
(Ar/O2) of 100/0.  We have investigated the 
dependence of the structure as a function of 
annealing treatment. In addition, the low 
frequency and rf frequency properties of the 
deposited films were fabricated to realizing 
hairpin microstrip resonator. 
 
3. Experimental Procedure 
 
The target composition of (Zr0.8Sn0.2)TiO4 
was synthesized via a conventional solid-state 
reaction.  Starting powders of high-purity 
ZrO2, SnO2, TiO2, and doping 1 wt% ZnO were 
weighted and placed in polypropylene 
containers with milling media for 24 h in 
distilled water.  The mixture was dried at 
100°C, then thoroughly milled before it was 
calcined at 1000°C for 3 h.  The calcined 
powder was sintered at 1400°C for 4 h.  The 
sintered powder (Zr0.8Sn0.2)TiO4 was ground 
and sieved through 100-mesh screen to produce 
ZST target powder.  The powder was then 
pressed into disks having 3- inch diameters and 
6-mm thicknesses, to be used as ZST targets.  
Film deposition was prepared using rf 
magnetron sputtering, as previously described.  
All of the films were deposited at a fixed rf 
power level of 300 W, a substrate temperature 
of 450oC, an operating pressure of 5 mTorr and 
a mixture of argon and oxygen at various 
flow-rate ratios of 100/0.  With different 
annealing temperatures (500°C ~ 700°C) and 
annealing times (2h ~ 6h), the deposited films 
have been observe on physical properties.  
The film structure was analyzed by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max . ) at 30 ??
kv and 20 mA with Cu Ka radiation.  The 
morphology of the film surface was determined 
using an atomic force microscope (AFM, 
Digital Instrument DI3000).  
On the other hand, the dielectric constant  
of the ZST thin film was evaluated by 
capacitance-voltage (C–V) measurement. The 
test samples with 
metal- insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor 
structures were prepared on n-type Si substrates.  
The sample devices (Pt/ZST/Si/Pt) were 
fabricated by symmetrically depositing Pt 
electrodes (diameter 0.5mm) on both sides of 
the ZST/Si structure.  All electrodes were 
prepared by using ion sputtering.  The C-V, 
curve of the MIS capacitors were measured by 
using a HP4192 Impedance Analyzer. 
The radio frequency measurement 
technique described here requires that the 
dielectric film be deposited on a metal layer and 
capped with a top metal electrode layer.  The 
structure of sample is Al/ZST/Al/Si structure 
(Fig. 1).  All electrodes were prepared by using 
rf magnetron sputtering.  The top electrode 
layer is then patterned into suitable test 
structures by photolithography.  A 
ground-signal probe is connected to vector 
network analyzer to measure the capacitance of 
the sample structures.  The probe makes 
contact to the center circular patch of metal 
which functions as the top electrode of the 
capacitor, and the metal outside the ring which 
functions effectively as the ground.  The metal 
patterning of the dielectric is avoided because of 
the probe is not directly contact to bottom 
electrode.  The electrical path to the bottom 
electrode of the capacitor is made through the 
large capacitor formed between the bottom 
metal layer and the large top ground [14].  The 
dielectric properties of ZnO-doped 
Zr0.8Sn0.2TiO4 films will be evaluated with using 
the capacitance value, and realized the hairpin 
microstrip resonator. 
 
4. Results and Discussion 
 
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of ZST thin 
films deposited on n-type Si(100) substrates at a 
substrate temperature 450°C, a rf power of 
300W, a deposition pressure of 5 mTorr with 
various annealing temperatures and annealing 
times.  As observed from the x-ray diffraction 
pattern, the peaks of ZST (101), (111), (002), 
(020), (112) and (103) were very distinct.  The 
intensities of (111) peak were enhanced with 
increasing annealing temperature and annealing 
time.  As the annealing temperature and 
annealing time were increased to 600oC for 4h, 
the intensities of the ZST peaks (111) was 
relatively increased with the others due to 
higher orientation and thereafter decreased.  It
