circuit design simplifying, the 12 design variables are 
reduced to 6, including four parameters of the spiral 
inductor, and channel width (w) of the nMOSFET, and the 
maximum value (Cv,max) of the varactor. In addition, a 
spiral inductor is designed through the method of 
designing an optimal spiral inductor [10]. Thus, the 6 
design variables are reduced to 2. 
Fig. 2 shows the design integration diagram of LC-
VCO limitation curves [8]. The gray region represents 
circuit characteristics within the limitation curve range, 
also called the design window. The intersection of the 
maximum and minimum tuning range curves means the 
circuit tuning range is just equal to the range specified by 
the specifications. When design parameters of the VCO 
fall into the design window region, it represents that the 
designed circuit characteristics satisfy circuit specifications.  
The process bias is serious due to the thickness error of 
the gate oxide layer, which not only results in errors of the 
oxide layer capacitance, but also greatly impacts on MOS 
varactor. It may change the parasitic capacitance of the 
transistor and the parameters of the drain source current 
and transconductor. Thus, the process bias should be 
considered in the design window. In addition, the metal 
line width may directly impact on inductance values and 
then change input oscillation frequency, thus, the width 
should be taken into account. To clearly define the 
characteristics generated from the design window during 
process bias, the amount of thickness bias of the oxide 
layer and the amount of width bias of the metal line are 3 
% and ±40 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the error of the 
inductance value during process bias is ±0.39 %, 
calculated by the amount of width bias of the metal line 
combined with the inductance calculating method [10].  
The design window is adjusted via the design theory, 
as shown in Fig. 3. Considering the process bias of worse 
case, the gray area in the figure represents the area where 
the design point meets the specifications located in the 
process bias. By comparing the design window, where the 
process bias is considered and not considered, the design 
window with the process bias has 23.3% of reduction, 
which indicates the design window is capable of designing 
an accurate circuit. According to the verification, the 
design points not meeting the specifications are located 
around the design window. The design points must be far 
away from the design window if the affect of the process 
bias is considered in the design. Therefore, a design 
meeting the specifications can be achieved, and the bias 
can be avoided even if the circuit has other process bias.  
 b. Automation Program Design 
In order to speed up design of the integrated pn 
complementary cross-coupled LC voltage controlled 
oscillator, the automation design implementation process is 
as shown in Fig. 4, and hopes to achieve optimal efficiency. 
The automation design process is as follows:  
(1) Given specifications of PN complementary cross-
coupled LC-VCO: Vdd, center frequency, tuning range, 
lowest phase noise, maximum power consumption, 
tuning range, and minimum output amplitude.  
(2) According to circuit specifications, the technology 
node and the design kit meeting process technique are 
selected.  
(3) Based on the process structure parameters and the 
design kit, the active and passive equivalent circuit 
model parameters are selected.  
(4) Based on the limitation conditions needed for 
specifications, create the design window.   
(5) Judge whether the window exists. If the judgment 
4 
gain of the transistor. As a result, the capability of 
overcoming circuit consumption lowers and the phase noise 
characteristics are worse. Based on the above, if the circuit 
design intends to improve phase noise characteristics, then 
the design points must be farther away from the threshold 
limitation lines. The nearer to the maximum voltage limit 
line the design points, the better the noise phase 
characteristics. 
To achieve optimal circuit efficiency, the figures of merit 
(FoM) of the circuit are used for comparison, as follows: 
 ( ) 20log 10log
1
c dcf PFoM L f
f mW
⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞= Δ − +⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟Δ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠
 (1) 
where L(Δf) is the phase noise value when the carrier wave fc 
deviates from frequency of f; Pdc is DC power consumption.  
Figure 7 shows the distribution of figures of merit of the 
design window. FoM is calculated by (1), the FoM of all the 
design points of the design window distribute in a hill shape. 
The optimal design points are in the central design window, 
as shown in the white points in the figure. The FoM of the 
oscillation circuit include the characteristic parameters of the 
phase noise, the central oscillation, the DC power 
consumption, and others. This design can obtain the FoM of 
the design points from the design window, and no slight 
adjustment is carried out.  
Figure 8 shows the position where the oscillator deviates 
from main frequency of 100 kHz and 1 MHz, and the phase 
noise is -85 dBc/Hz and -111.3 dBc/Hz, respectively. Figure 
9 shows the tuning range of the oscillator is 0.33 GHz, 
converted into 6.92 % of frequency tuning range. The solid 
line represents measured results, and broken line expresses 
the simulation results of this design program. Compared to 
other literature, as shown in Table I, the proposed the circuit 
design technique uses a design window, which can allow 
designers to easily finish the selection of optimal design 
points, and greatly decrease time of optimal circuit design. 
At the same time, the efficiency of circuit is consistent with 
other studies. This design method combines the design of RF 
integrated circuits, accelerating integration of the circuit.

self-alignment etching or lithographic patterning with dry film 
resist. This research adopts self-alignment etching approach. 
For the electrical connection from the pads to the solder balls, 
copper RDL routings are next formed by the sequences of 
seed layer sputtering, dry film resist lithography, copper 
plating, resist striping, and wet etching on the seed layer. The 
last two steps in Figure 1 are the formations of the organic 
passivation and ball mounting, respectively. After performing 
visual inspection and marking the apparent defects, 
mechanical die saw singulates the individual chip scale 
packaging (CSP) for the final image tests before shipping.

The Test Vehicle Design 
The test vehicle design must involve test patterns to 
evaluate not only the structural integrity but also the electrical 
performance. Since structure integrity is strongly related to 
the reliability test item which is not an issue of this study, we 
focus on the electrical evaluation of the TSV functionality in 
later works. 
Base on the literature, the daisy-chain is the most common 
pattern to measure the continuity of the electrical resistance 
and the single via contact resistance RC. However, if the chain 
pattern is symmetrically design, the interconnection 
characteristics is able to be analyzed quantitatively because 
the total resistance can be added up by a specific designed 
parameter. To this end, the new via chain test patterns

width and length of the copper line, as listed in Table 1, were 
designed to measure the RSH for the copper and the RSH for the 
copper layer were calculated as 2.16 mΩ/sq from all of the 
samples. Consistent resistance from different samples show 
good uniformity and accuracy of the measured data.

The Kelvin contact resistance test used four-point probe 
measurement methodology which provides a constant current 
between the contacts 1 and 3 show in Figure 8, and the 
voltages were measured between the contacts 2 and 4. Since 
there is no current pass through contacts 2 and 4, the voltage 
drop V24 = V2 - V4 at the metal contacts of a single via bottom 
can be measured. Furthermore, since voltage only drop at the 
via contact, RC of a single via can be calculated accurately. In 
addition, various Kelvin structures with respectively 60 μm 
and 55 μm via diameters were measured, and linear V24 verses 
I13 were both obtained as show in Figures 9. The slopes in 
Figures 9 are respectively 7 mΩ and and 9 mΩ for 60 μm and 
55 μm diameters , and both of the values are less than the 
literature [5]. Note that the resistance for the smaller TSV 
diameter is larger because of the smaller copper-aluminum 
contact area, and the results in Figures 9 are more accuracy 
than the literature because the resistance only for the contact 
position was measured.

Characterization 
In our previous work [7], the daisy-chain characteristics 
were first measured by two-point probe for the structure with 
82 vias and 60 μm via diameter. Resistance of the 
daisy-chain, including all the connecting metals such as solder 
ball, copper RDL line, and aluminum pad extension, was 
measured 23.4 Ω. That is, the mean resistance of a single via 
with the upper copper and the lower aluminum traces is about 
285 mΩ. Note that the measured value is not only less than 
the minimum requirement (1 Ω), but also close to the 
literature [4]. Since the resistance of a single node can not 
accurately obtain from the previous structure, the new via 
chain structure shows in Figure 3 were designed in this study 
and each node in the new structure contains the same via with 
the upper copper and the lower aluminum shows in Figure 10. 
In this work, test samples with (a) 60 μm via diameter and 38 
node path and (b) 55 μm via diameter with 72 node path were 
respectively designed to observe the process variation and to 
measure RT for different node path using four-point probe, 
which is more accurate than the previously used two-point 
probe. The measurement results are shown in Figures 11, 
where the lower indices n is the numbers of vias for each 
measurement. For example, n = 35 indicates resistance of a 
  
Conclusions 
The electrical characteristics of the RDL line and the TSV 
on CIS have been studied in this work. Several test patterns 
with suitable measurement methodologies were designed to 
evaluate the electrical performance on TSV structure. In this 
work, the RSH of the metal wire were obtained by the snake 
test pattern, and the metal contact RC for the single via was 
extracted through the four-point probe measurement with 
about 9 mΩ and 7 mΩ, respectively. Consequently, the 
electrical continuity were demonstrated. Finally, the ILK 
between the two RDL lines and the via isolation are in pA 
order at the work voltage, and it indicates that the TSV 
worked properly and the process is suitable for the 3D WLP 
applications.
