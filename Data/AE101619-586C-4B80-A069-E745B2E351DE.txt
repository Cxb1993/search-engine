摘要 
本研究主要目的為探討汽輪機發電、冷卻水塔耗電與冷卻水出口溫度之間的
關係，根據不同冷卻水出口溫度下所計算的汽輪機發電功率與冷卻水塔風扇耗電
功率做分析，進而找出最佳的冷卻水出口溫度並做控制。 
汽輪發電機(TG)效率會受到冷凝器真空度的影響，真空度則是受到冷卻水入
口溫度的影響，而冷卻水入口溫度則是由冷卻水塔所控制，因此本研究主要建立
汽輪發電機與冷卻水塔之間最佳操作模式，提供現場操作人員最佳操作基準。研
究結果顯示，經由所建立之汽輪發電機效率預測模式和冷卻水入口溫度之冷卻水

Abstract 
This paper presents a model-based optimization approach to determine operation 
mode of a set of fans in the cooling tower by considering turbine-generator and 
cooling tower as an integrated system. The optimization problem is formulated as to 
maximize the net power output, which is the result of subtracting power consumption 
of fans in cooling tower from power generated by turbine-generator. The operations 
of both units are characterized by a data-driven method, local model network, which 
presents a set of local models in the formats of linear equations. The optimal problem 
is then solved by linear programming algorithm. With all mathematical work and 
without any change in the existing plant, the energy saving is handily accomplished. 
This study reported energy saving of 0.5% of power output of a TG system.  
  
Key words:  optimization, turbine-generator, cooling tower, local model network, 
power generation system. 
前言 
Greenhouse gas emissions and energy crisis have gained a lot of attention in the past decades, and 
become the urgent issues these days. Many initiatives have been proposed to deal with these issues. 
One way is to develop renewable energy resources without emitting greenhouse gases such as wind 
energy, solar energy etc. The other way is to conserve the energy consumption.  
As a matter of fact, there is still a lot of room to conserve energy use by enhancing energy 
efficiency of many industrial processes. Power generation system (PGS) is the one attracting much 
attention, because electricity is a major energy format used in the daily life and in the industry. Besides 
commercial power plants, cogeneration systems, which provide both of steam and electricity, is 
becoming popular in the community and energy-intensive industries, such as petrochemical, iron and 
steel etc. A typical PGS comprises boiler, turbine-generator (TG), condenser, and cooling tower (CT).

hinders the incorporation of prior knowledge about the system into the model. 
As being transparent and able to model nonlinear system, local model network (LMN) is used in 
this work. This technique is a typical multi-model approach used for modeling any nonlinear system, 
whose behavior is described as the weighted sum of a set of local linear models [16, 17]. The outputs of 
each local model are valid in a limited domain, whose boundary is determined by clustering technique 
or domain knowledge. This method often gives a more manageable and transparent representation of 
the nonlinear system. This study applies LMN to modeling CT and TG with operation data. An optimal 
operating mode for a set of fans in CT, which maximizes the net power output, can be obtained by 
solving the equation sets of acquired models with linear programming. The framework proposed in this 
work can be handily applied to any commercial power plants. The case study on one of power 
generation units in China Steel Corporation (CSC) demonstrates that the proposed approach can 
increase significant power output by simply conducting mathematical computation and subsequently 
adjusting the revolution speed of a set of fans in CT. 
For the sake of clarity, we take a real power generation plant as an example to illustrate the 
formation of objective function and the way of problem-solving. The studied case is just as any other 
typical PGS. 
 
Fig. 1.  A process flow diagram of a typical PGS 
As shown in Fig.1, it consists of two boilers, two turbine-generators (TG6 and TG7), two 
condensers, and a cooling tower (CT4) with six fans. High pressure steam, generated in a boiler, is 
introduced into a turbine which in turn drives a power generator to produce electric power. A 
condenser in the PGS is usually operated in a vacuum condition. As a thumb of rule, lower back 
pressure is achieved in a condenser; more electric power is produced in a TG system. Cooling water, 
the most popular but not the only medium, is used in this study to condense exhausted steam in a 
condenser. The circulation of cooling water works as that cooling water becomes warm when 
absorbing heat in a condenser; then it becomes cold when releasing heat in a CT. The colder cooling 
water enters in a condenser, the higher degree of vacuum is achieved. 
Considering only the TG system depicted by the dashed line shown in Fig.1, the thermal efficiency of 
the TG unit can be denoted as:

主要內容 
The thermal efficiency model of a TG system in the studied plant shown in (4) has 22 variables. 
Redundant information and collinearity are embedded among those variables. It is necessary to reduce 
the number of dimensions before modeling. This section begins with data pretreatment, including key 
variable selection, data smoothing, normal distribution examination; is then followed by the work of 
LMN. 
LMN Identification Based on SFCM  
Based on divide-and-conquer strategy, LMN approach develops several local linear models 
corresponding to different operating regimes. The global output is obtained by summing local ones 
whose linear model are transparent and physically meaningful. The complete model output is denoted 
as:

It is a typical linear programming problem with constraints, and can be easily solved by linear

結果與討論 
The data used in this study were collected from one of CSC power plants from Feb.2 to June.30,. 
The sampling frequency of the data is one per minute. There are 1440 samples per day. The first 6000 
pieces of data are used as a training set; the rest of them are used for testing. With key variables being 
selected and following the LMN identification algorithm proposed in this study, the results of the 
predicted MSE of LMN versus cluster number for TG6 are showed in Fig.3 (a). The satisfactory 
number of LMN for this case is 4 (i.e. 6 4TGc = ) and final MSE is 0.02. Then the model is validated by 
the test data of the next five months (Feb.2-Mar.2, Mar.4-Mar.30, Apr.1-Apr.27, Apr.28-May.31, and 
June.1-June.30). Fig.3(b) show the estimated thermal efficiency against the real thermal efficiency of 
TG6 in a typical day, April,7. The figures demonstrate that the proposed method have a good modeling 
performance. The performance of modeling in terms of MSE for all the test data in each month is listed 
in Table I.

Generally, CT operation guides or manuals suggest to manipulate the rotation speed of a fan set so 
that the approach be maintained within a range of 5.6℃~8.3℃. The average approach of the original 
operations in this day is 9.45℃ while that of suggested ones is 7.18℃, which falls within the 
above-stated range. 
The computations of solving the optimal operation were done for the rest of testing data from Feb.2 
to June 30. The net power gained and the approach are averaged for each month and summarized in 
Table II. The percentage of net power gained by implementing the proposed optimal operation to the 
output power generated by TG6 and TG7 is also calculated. Table II shows average power gained in 
these five months is between 0.46 and 0.9 MW and the approach is reduced between -0.11 and 3.27℃. 
Comparing with the whole power output in the studied system, the net power gained by the proposed 
technique is relatively small. But summing up the energy saving, it is about 0.24 million USD per year
