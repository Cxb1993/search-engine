英文摘要 
Over the past decade, product and process technology migrations have been due to short product life 
cycle. Under this circumstance, companies have to develop more advanced technology and purchase 
sophisticated tools to meet the market demand and reduce manufacturing cost as well. When process 
technology migration occurred, DRAM manufacturers always used the past experiences to handle the 
migration. However, the challenge is totally different to the past that causes the manufacturers have to suffer 
many unexpected difficulties. 
In this work, an integrated model for technology migration is proposed. There are two major issues regarding 
the technology migration, the time schedule of technology migration and production planning & control 
during the migration period. Regarding to the time schedule setting, a time-cost function of capacity 
expansion should be developed. Simultaneously, the relationship between the capacity of new technology 
generation and its unit manufacturing cost should be analyzed.  
Based on the above information, a wafer release schedule of new technology under the minimal capacity 
cost can be defined. In the second year, a production planning and control model will be developed. The 
production planning will focus on CCR (Capacity Constraint Resources) to define the complete wafer release 
schedule and apply X-factor to schedule the production processes during the migration period. There are two 
control mechanisms to control and monitor the migration which are real time control and predicting control 
module. In the real time control module, WIP status is the important factor to decide to trigger rescheduling 
module or not. Besides, a foresee function will be performed by predicting control module which will trigger 
the rescheduling module by the bias between loading and capacity curves. The solution of the issues of 
technology migration is proposed. It represents an efficient and effective migration will be performed during 
the technology migration period. We expect this model can be applied to the other industries with same 
situation.

代，既有技術世代是否會快速的被淘汰？其中，結構較為偏向整合式製造 ((Integrated Device 
Manufacturing, IDM)的 DRAM 產業，對於降低平均製造成本的依賴程度更甚於一般半導體代工廠
(Foundry)，因此，DRAM 產業面對製程技術世代轉換難題的機會及頻率也高出 Foundry 廠許多，圖 2
所顯示為未來 15 年半導體製造技術演進之預估(International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors: 
2010 Updates)。從圖 2 吾人可以發現，DRAM 技術演進速度高出 Logic IC 製造業，其製程技術世代轉
換的管理複雜程度也將提升不少。 
 
圖 2 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductor: 2010 Updates 
 
從策略制訂乃至作業管理的層面來看，製程技術世代轉換問題可分成二大面向來觀察，分別為製
程技術轉換時程規劃以及轉換期間的生產規劃二個角度。製程技術轉換時程包括轉換時間點制定以及
轉換速率，其規劃過程必需同時考慮市場需求波動、技術成熟度以及資金取得；而在轉換期間的生產
規劃上，管理者必需根據上階層所制訂之轉換時程決定新世代產能的取得（包含先進機台取得及既有
機台調整）、新技術世代產品的投料控制（新、舊產品轉換節奏）、以及現場派工，而這些決策的制訂
必需同時考量產能取得前置時間、技術轉換對現場之影響、以及系統績效衡量。從上述分析結果吾人
可得知，晶圓製造產業在需求高度不確定、技術世代更替快速的複雜環境之下，製程技術世代的轉換
將會是一項充滿挑戰的複雜問題，而DRAM 產業在單位製造成本的龐大壓力下，其技術轉換管理問題
的複雜度將更勝Foundry 產業。 
綜觀上述問題分析，半導體製程技術轉換問題的核心為生產系統組態轉換時機以及系統轉換下之
生產規劃，其目的為：在系統受到影響程度最小的前提下，使技術轉換過程順利完成，並維持企業之
競爭優勢。雖然過去已有許多學者針對半導體製造產業提出各類的生產規劃模式，而且大都以等候網
路、數學規劃或者平均數分析進行各機器群組所需機台數及投料之估算(Iwata et al., 2003; Walid and 
Gharbi, 2002; Chou and You, 2001)。然而，這些研究卻未將系統所面臨的不確定性以及設備投資風險納
入考量，在半導體製造這樣具有高度需求不確定以及投資風險的產業中，如此的規劃結果必然有所不
足。 
關於在具有需求或技術不確定性環境下之生產規劃相關研究方面，有許多學者分別討論這兩項影
響因子下的規劃手法。針對需求不確定的相關文獻大都以線性規劃模式並將未來需求變化趨勢塑模成
為若干個具有不同發生機率的需求情境(scenario)求算最佳化生產策略(Swaminathan, 2000; Hood et al., 
2003; Chou et al., 2007)。然而，上述這些相關研究卻未在『情境』發生機率的計算與制訂上多加著墨。
利用情境所計算出之規劃結果不外乎是利用各種情境發生機率所估算出之所需產能加權期望值或是以
發生機率最高之情境作為產能計算目標，無論是何種計算方法，從統計的角度來看，發生偏移的機率
都相當高。除了利用上述所提及之較為主觀的計算方式外，Driver and Goffinet (1998) 提出在需求不確
 8 
生產環境的狀態如何（如機台的狀態，WIP 量等），而一定的法則來進行投料，如單一法（Uniform）。
而封閉式迴圈之投料策略則是以工廠中的某些資訊，例如WIP 量、重要機台之負荷…等為指標，以作
為是否繼續投料之依據。一般而言，因為封閉式迴圈之投料策略會依現場動態性的改變而有所調整，
所以在整體績效的表現上比開放式迴圈之投料策略為佳(Miller 1990)。在封閉式迴圈之投料策略較有名
的有Glassey et al.( 1988a, b)提出避免饑餓法，即是利用安全存量的觀念作為投料之基準。其主要的目的
在於盡量提高瓶頸機台的使用率，同時也希望能夠降低在製品的存量。Wein (1988)提出的 ”工作負荷
調整法” 係以目前系統內對限制資源工作站之總工作負荷(或稱實質存貨；W)，來作為投料決策之依據。
若此工作負荷小於設定值，則進行投料作業。Lou (1989a,b)所提出來的雙界法。這種方法是針對每個機
台訂定簡單的控制法則，以實際存貨水準與計劃存貨水準之差距，及實際累積生產與累積需求之差異
程度來作為投料的依據，並利用存貨水準的差值、產品的權重以及層級的權重三者的乘數來決定投料
的優先順序。另一較為有名的投料策略是Spearman et al.(1989, 1992)所提出的常數在製品量投料法
(CONWIP)。CONWIP 是一種介於 JIT 與推式系統(push system)間之一種生產控制型態。此外，過去
也有許多學者針對半導體製造現場管理進行探討，Hungand Chang (2002)提出一套修正的最小寬鬆時間
法則與最小剩餘加工時間法則，期望能達到縮短生產時間的目標；Bowman (2002)則是以JIT 為基礎，
提出一套投料控制法則，避免瓶頸機台閒置以達成最大產出；Louw and Page (2004)則是利用等候網路
模型，計算半導體晶圓廠在以TOC 為基礎之管控法則下，緩衝時間大小之制訂法則。 
然而，上述研究卻未針對生產系統轉換過程中之現場管理深入探討，事實上，探討此問題的相關
研究也十分稀少。在生產系統轉換過程中，生產線上的產品組合會較穩定時期複雜且多變、產能組態
也將隨著時間變化，在投料、產能都不穩定的情形下，過去學者所提出的管理手法幾乎都無法適用。
而從過去半導體製造管理經驗也可得知，當系統中存在超過三個世代以上的產品，管理將會變得非常
困難，系統績效也將變的難以維持，因此，找出一個在變動系統下的現場管理模式，不只解決製程技
術世代轉換問題，對於產品世代複雜的Foundry 產也將有極大的助益。 
二、 研究目的 
Chou 等學者(2007)曾經說明，如同半導體這類產能設置週期時間繁長、資本投資龐大的產業，若
將各類管理活動分開獨立進行規劃，將無法獲得一個有效的解決方法。因此，對於製程技術世代轉換
的問題吾人必需整合並提出一套涵蓋上階層轉換策略規劃及現場製造管理的決策模式。針對上階層轉
換策略制訂，本研究選擇以技術演進藍圖(Technology Roadmap)作為轉換時機選擇的決策依據，而在轉
換時程的制訂上，本研究將市場需求不確定性、技術演進變化及產能取得前直時間偏移等不確定因子
以隨機變數的型態建置於模式之中，藉以求得最佳的轉換時間表。 
而在現場製造管理上，本研究進一步將之細分為生產規劃與現場管控二部分。在生產規劃中，吾
人以限制機台(Capacity Constraint Resources, CCR）作為規劃標的，將上階層規劃之新技術世代投料時
程，利用新、舊世代產品佔用限制機台產能之大小，將其轉化成為決策時段內之新、舊產品投料組合，
並再以X-Factor觀念進行生產系統內新、舊世代在製品於後製程之預排動作。而現場管控模式之主要目
的為，當製造系統發生足以影響技術轉換成敗之偏移時，能夠即時發出警示，並利用修正規劃結果或
重新規劃以克服系統偏移所造成之影響。本研究所提出之現場管控模式可區分為即時管控與預測管控
二部分。由於系統內之在製品存量足以表徵系統目前所發生的狀況，因此，吾人在各生產區段之主要
機台(Key Machine)設置在製品存量之上、下警示線，並監視其在製品存量，當在製品存量高或低過警
示線時，吾人即可察覺系統所發生的狀況，並加以即時處理；而在預測管控方法中，可透過比對往後
某一時間區段內之實際產能負荷與當初所規劃之產能曲線，藉由其偏離程度，吾人可得知目前之產能
狀況是否可負荷當初所排定之結果，若偏移程度過大，則必需修正或重新進行規劃。 
新世代製程技術的導入，半導體製造產業所面臨問題已非要或不要，而是該如何進行；對於DRAM
 10 
及其重要性以不如以往那樣容易判定，新製程技術世代的導入對企業的助益將變得難以預測，
技術世代轉換規劃當然也變的極為困難。

圖 3. 每單位容量之 DRAM 成本與售價關係圖 
 
承如背景與目的中所述 DRAM 產業在種種環境因素下，對於在新製程轉換需求的決策上
可說是相當難以取捨，尤其業界正面臨所謂大者恆大的態勢下，如沒有果斷以及有效的轉換
勢必影響公司未來的存亡。有新製程技術的問世，此時表示著產業現有環境中存在著比當前
製程成本更低的技術，這對於追求單位製造成本最低化之 DRAM 產業而言，無疑是企業永續
發展與存活的一項挑戰。從文獻的收集與整理，吾人發現 DRAM 產業的單位容量製造價格與
市場售價有著如圖 2 之現象。在現有技術之情況下，由於機台成本的攤提以及產品良率穩定
等因素下，其 DRAM 之單位容量製造成本大致會趨於一平穩之狀態，而 DRAM 之單位容量
市場價格方面的變化則會因企業的經營策略、新產品或新製程技術的問世而有逐漸下降之態
勢，而此部分的變化趨勢除從市場的歷史資料整理取得，也可從 DRAM 的技術演進藍圖
(Technology Roadmap)中分析獲取之。然而對於新製程技術的導入上其單位容量製造費用變化，
由於初期機台成本昂貴以及新技術初期製程不穩定而導致單位容量製造費用相較於現行成熟
技術高，但隨著產品良率的提升與機台成本折舊攤提，其單位容量製造費用將比現行技術來
的較低，所以新製程技術之單位製造成本也將呈現如學習率曲線之走勢，如此可知新技術的
導入決策時點將發生在圖 2 新技術出現時點與下一世代技術出現時點之間。 
由於新技術的轉換主要目的是期望為公司帶來更多的利潤，本研究之總利潤計算方式以
新技術決定開始轉換後至下一世代技術出現前之間所發生之總收益，扣除在相同時間範圍下
所花費之總成本，因此在以最大化公司利潤之條件情況下，決定最佳之技術轉換開始時段實
為本研究之目標，而最佳之技術轉換開始時段之研究考量範圍，是以其新製程技術之出現時
點與下一世代製程技術出現時點之間為其範圍，吾人稱此為新製程技術之生命週期時間，其
範圍將被分隔為 n 個時間區段，以利後續模式之建構分析與探討，其時間區段之長短可由管
理者自行設定之。總利潤函數如下所示且後續將就各部份進行介紹。 
 TP(t) = ∑Q 
 
   
× P − ∑(FC + VC )

2.2. 計算新世代製程技術之變動成本 
新世代製程技術的導入將有助於單位生產成本的下降，然而在單位成本計算過程中，
變動成本會隨著現場人員與機台之配合度成熟以及製程良率的提高而有所下降，而此部
分的概念如同學習率曲線函數一般，因此吾人利用此一概念建構變動成本曲線，而使製
造管理成本隨時間推移逐漸下降之現象，得以納入新技術製造變動成本中。 
在上述各因素需求之考量下，本研究透過數學模式建構新製程技術轉換決策模式，藉由製程
轉換期間收益與成本之變化情況，求得最佳導入時點使新製程技術轉換之利潤最大化，讓管理者
能透過此模式得到適合本身的製程轉換時點。其細部之邏輯計算過程歸納整理如下列所示： 
Step1. 計算當前製程技術之總收益 
由於當前技術市場價格已趨於穩定，則價格在此視為不隨時間變化之定值。而後須
計算當前製程技術生產之產量，累加至導入新製程技術前期。所得之生產量需與需求函
數進行最小化比較，求出實際產出量。並將實際產出量與價格相乘求得前一世代製程技
術之收益。 
Step2. 建立產品市場單位售價 
管理者由經驗判斷製程技術價格之轉換速率後，利用 Sigmoid 函數，即可得出在各
個𝑖時間區段平均價格之 Sigmoid 函數值。將所得到之趨勢正規化還原，而市場價格之還
原範圍管理者可由過去的市場資料來進行判斷。 
Step3. 計算學習率下產品生產量 
由於新製程技術初期，作業人員對於技術參數設定或者是未知的問題點都尚未熟悉。
所以，工廠所投入之生產量並非百分之百產出，而產量隨作業人員操作之次數逐漸上升
至穩定，不良率隨時間而逐漸減少。所得之生產量亦須與需求函數進行最小化比較後，
再計算收益。 
Step4. 計算新舊製程總收益 
利用 Step1.與 Step3.所得之收益加總，即可得出各區間之新舊製程技術之總營業收
益。 
Step5. 計算舊式代技術機台數 
利用𝐼𝐶片顆粒上之總容量，使新舊製程產能相除，推算出企業應導入多少台新製程
技術機台。 
Step6. 計算各時段機台價格下降值 
機台價格隨著時間區段呈現等差趨勢，利用等差之觀點給定在每個時間區段，機台
價格有一個固定價格跌幅，以平均折舊之概念攤提機台購入時初始價格與機台最終之殘
餘價格之差。得出每個時間購入機台之價格。 
Step7. 計算在各時間區段之產能設置成本 
由 Step6.與 Step7.求得在某特定時間區段所購入之新製程技術機台價格與需購入之
 14 
 
1. 定義產能限制機台群（Capacity Constraint Resources, CCR） 
在此一步驟管理者可以定義產能限制機台的標準，亦即設定一個機台使用率標準。
當機台使用率大於此一數值時則為產能限制機台。 
2. 計算新舊製程產品在各個限制機台生產所需之產能耗損比率 
3. 計算舊製程產品的減投量 
4. 新舊製程皆以均勻分佈投料 
 
Step 3：以現場目前的在製品狀態（數量＋位置）以及投料計畫，利用 X-Factor 的觀念預排轉換期
間之生產排程，並計算 Key Machine 在各時間單位的產能需求。 
Step 4：排定調機排程 
某些機台由於新舊製程的轉換需要將機台停機調整，而其停機調整的安排必須以不影響
新舊製程為前提。因此吾人將以需調整機台之產能曲線及產能需求曲線之差異加以排定其調
機計畫。 
Step5：當新製程投料率改變時即進入新階段的排程。此時必須以過去的歷史資料重新計算各機台
的 X-Factor，再回到 Step2 開始新階段的排程。 
2. 技術世代轉換之現場管控模式 
晶圓製造可謂是現今最複雜的產業之一，生產步驟多再加上生產製程中充滿著諸如機台當
機、加工時間變異、維修保養(Preventive Maintenance, PM)等不確定因素。因此，即使將生產
計畫規劃得完美無缺，計畫也常常趕不上變化。在此狀況下，一套完備的現場管控模式是相當
重要的。 
在現場管控模式中最重要的是找到足以影響排程與生產結果的因子且加以管控，如此才能
確保計畫目標的達成。一般而言，在現場管控系統中可以分為即時管控及預測管控模式。所謂
即時管控模式即以即時性資料判斷現場狀況與計畫的偏離程度，再以偏離程度的大小作為是否
啟動重新規劃機制的判斷。而預測管控模式則是在一段時間後（例如：每三個小時或每天）以
現場即時資料往後排程以預估未來依計畫執行時之產能負荷狀況，並判斷此未來狀況與計畫之
產能曲線偏離程度以決定是否修正計畫。以下則對此兩種管控模式加以詳細說明。 
 
(1) 即時管控模式： 
a. 生產週期時間之控制： 
對目前 DRAM 產業的競爭力而言，降低生產成本是一個重要的議題。另外在
工廠端對於生產週期時間的控制與產品的良率(Yield)是息息相關的，在 Meyerdorf 
and Yang(1997)的研究中提到，產品在生產線上的生產週期時間過長會有兩項較嚴
重的影響，第一、潛在於製程或設備的問題延後發現。第二、晶圓會受到微粒
(Particle)或化學氧化(Oxidize)的影響，造成良率的下降。因此為了讓生產線的在製
品降至最低又能確保產出不受影響，生產週期時間(Cycle Time, C/T)的掌控就顯得
格外重要。 
生產週期時間(C/T)簡單的定義就是加工時間(Process time)加等候時間(Queue 
Time)， 如下式所示。 
 16 
𝑇𝑅 𝐶𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 =
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝
𝑇𝑅
 =  
 𝑊𝐼𝑃 × 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝
𝑀𝑜𝑣𝑒
   
 
吾人將上述三種生產週期時間指標之說明與觀察指標彙整如下表 1 所示。雖
然工廠端可以利用各種生產週期時間指標來監控生產線的績效，但為避免工廠管
理者陷入追求生產週期時間績效的迷失，故仍須與其他管控模式互相搭配，才能
讓產品的生產週期時間達到較佳的監控效果。 
 
表 1  各種生產週期時間指標應用說明 
 
b. 在製品數量之控制： 
一般而言，WIP 狀態是現場的即時資料中足以反映目前生產活動正常順暢與
否的主要資訊。機台前的 WIP 量過多顯示可能機台的產能不足或是派工出了問題; 
而 WIP 量過少則可能是前面機台或派工出了問題。這些狀況都會使計畫難以達成，
因此在即時管控模式中可以 WIP 狀態作為判斷是否啟動重新規劃機制之訊號。在
此我們將採用 TOC 理論中的暫存區管理的觀念，對每個主要機台（Key Machine）
設定兩個警戒線：LL（Low Limit）以及 HL（High Limit）。當 WIP 量低於 LL 或
高於 HL 時則啟動重新規劃機制。而 LL 與 HL 的設定則以 GI/G/m 等候理論中平
均等候線長度再加上管理者對於工廠管理能力的評斷參數。 
(2) 預測管控模式： 
a. 產能負荷偏離度之控制 
如前述所言，預測管控模式則是在一段時間後以現場即時資料往後排程以預
估未來依計畫執行時每個單位時間內之產能負荷狀況，並判斷此未來狀況與計畫
之產能曲線偏離程度以決定是否修正計畫。由於預測有個非常重要的特性是：預
測會隨時間越遠而降低其準確度。因此假設未來的產能曲線有一定的可靠度，但
現場存在著許多的不確定性，所以依目前現場狀況資料往後排程所得到之單位時
間的機台產能負荷曲線可能會隨著時間延長而使其準確度下降。因此在比較產能
負荷與產能曲線之偏離度時，吾人將時間因素加入偏離容忍度的考量中，且設定
偏離容忍度(DT, Deviation Tolerance)。當產能負荷高於產能曲線且偏離度高於 DT; 
或產能負荷低於產能曲線且偏離度大於 DT 時，則啟動重新規劃機制。 
 18 
統資源瓶頸機台的 WIP 狀況來決定投料策略，若非瓶頸機台仍能充分供應瓶頸機
台 WIP 時不必急著投料，若預期系統資源瓶頸機台會斷料時再恢復投料。 
WRm = ACCRm / SCCRm 
Where 
WRm :瓶頸機台 m 之計畫工作負荷與實際工作負荷之比值  
3. 技術世代轉換之即時反應模式 
在現場管控模式中，不管是即時管控或預測管控模式都僅止於提出警示訊息，對於系統並
沒有提供該有的反應及行動。因此必須再設定一個模組提供系統警事後的訊號判讀與反應指示。
在預測管控模式中警示來源為產能偏離需求，因此計畫難以執行。在這種情形下唯一的行動只
有重新規劃，因此可以利用先前的規劃步驟以目前的狀態再規劃一次。如果是即時管控模式中
WIP 狀態偏離的警示則需判斷導致 WIP 偏離的主因。一般而言，WIP 狀態偏離可能造成的原
因有機台的統計波動以及產能偏離。若因此統計波動而引起，則可藉由派工法則來加以調整; 
但如果是產能偏離，例如此時該有 3 台機台投入生產，但目前僅有 2 台，此種狀況則為產能偏
離，則必須重新調整計畫，亦即可以利用先前的規劃步驟以目前的狀態再重新規劃一次 
上述階段之研究相關結果已彙整於吾人與李榮貴教授所共同指導之碩士生畢業論文裡(許敦皓, 
2012)，且其研究內容也亦發表於國際學術研討會 2012 ICINCO (9th International Conference on 
Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics)與 Advanced Materials Research 期刊論文中，其刊登之文
章如附錄三與附錄四所示。 
四、 結果與討論 
半導體產業屬於高資產、技術密集高且競爭相當激烈的產業，而對於台灣DRAM產業環境而言更
是嚴峻。由於台灣DRAM產業面臨著幾個主要問題：缺乏核心技術、以產值為導向的管理思維、欠缺
製程轉換技術，各家廠商可以解決的方法就是仰賴國外技術母廠引進製程技術支援，提升製程轉換能
力，透過新技術的產能提升達到降低製造生產成本的目標。然而，在引進新技術動輒數百億的產業中，
若管理者無法判斷應該在何時導入新技術可以為企業帶來最大利潤，則龐大的機台折舊費用與其他成
本，可能會影響企業的存亡。有鑑於此，本研究提出一套新製程技術轉換時機點決策模式。在需求環
境不確定下以技術演進藍圖為基底，透過新製程轉換相關決策因子的考量，以最大化企業利潤為目標
決策出較佳之轉換時點。其中利潤概念之考量為收益與成本之差額，收益因子包含市場價格、良品產
出量與舊技術機台汰換所得之利益，而成本方面主要為新技術機台之購入成本與變動成本。另一方面
對於現場製程轉換之管控上，本研究亦從新舊製程技術之生產規劃階段、技術世代轉換之現場管控階
段以及對於技術世代轉換之現場即時反應階段，利用TOC與CCR之相關概念分別對各階段提出相關決
策管控模式，提供管理者在現場執行轉換時所可能面臨到問題時，能有一套有系統且邏輯性之管控流
程，進而使管理者對於製程世代轉換上能更為順遂。 
前幾年的金融海嘯震驚了全世界，也帶給台灣半導體產業不少的衝擊，在半導體產業之中，唯有
不斷的提升製程能力與生產之績效，方能在瞬息萬變的市場中佔有一席之地，因此如何建立與訂立一
個可以快速因應市場變動且容易管控之廠區規模，亦或是發展一可含納多個製程技術之建廠管控思維，
實為後續相關研究可以進行探討之方向。 
就本質而論，本計畫之研究成果同時具有實務及學術價值。在實務方面，本計畫成果可提供半導

言，或許有能力進行如此龐大的投資以維持其領導地
位，但對於規模較小的企業而言，管理者對於新科技
的引進就必須更加審慎考慮。再者，根據研究指出，
IC 製造技術的生命週期，通常不會超過三年[3]。 
本文中製程技術世代轉換問題主要探討技術轉換
時間點，其規劃過程必須同時考慮市場需求波動、技
術成熟度以及資金取得，晶圓製造產業在需求高度不
確定、技術世代更替快速的複雜環境之下，製程技術
世代的轉換將會是一項充滿挑戰的複雜問題。主要目
的為在系統受到影響程度最小的前提下，使技術轉換
過程順利完成，並維持企業之競爭優勢。 
在新技術世代導入影響相關研究方面，[4]考慮新
機台提升製程穩定性以進行新世代產能置換的規劃問
題，但本研究卻未考量新科技技術對其他因子所造成
的影響，也未針對產能替換所必須的前置時間加以考
慮。[5]則提出了新技術導入的時間點決策方法，作者
利用新設備價格變化以及其對成本的影響求出最佳的
技術世代”完全替換”時機。[6]綜合上述二篇研究，提
出了一套在技術演進影響下之產能規劃手法，此研究
利用線性規劃模式進行在製造技術突破下之產能擴充
(Expansion)或是替換(Replacement)的決策，並加入時
間軸的概念。作者以最大化利潤作為目標，並考慮了
新設備取得成本將隨時間改變（新技術出現越久，其
購置成本越低），以及新設備的導入將降低製造成本作
為考量因子，計算新設備至入的最佳數量及時間點。
而[7]則是首度提出同時考慮需求不確定及新技術更替
影響下之產能規劃手法，針對當產能出現缺口時之產
能規劃模式進行討論，並考量新技術的出現對產能取
得成本所造成的影響，最後，利用市場需求的變化針
對產能規劃結果進行敏感度分析，以確認市場需求改
變對規劃結果所造成的影響。 
2 研究目的 
對於新世代製程技術的導入，半導體製造產業所
面臨的問題已非要或不要，而是該如何進行；對於
DRAM產業而言，新世代製程的導入成效更是攸關企
業存亡的關鍵。此一影響深遠且重大的決策問題，過
去卻鮮少有研究觸及。本研究期望為半導體製造產
業，特別是DRAM製造業，提供一個決策制訂的準則。 
因此，本研究之主要目的為在需求不確定下之新製
程技術的產能擴充或替換策略，以及新世代產品或服務
所需產能的導入策略二大部分。在新製程技術的產能規
劃手法方面，吾人發現，就台灣的IC製造產業而言，技
術演進歷程尚稱具有高度預測性。因此，針對此一部份
吾人可以透過產業所公布的技術發展藍圖(Technology 
Roadmap)作為依據，利用產能成本時間序列以及生產成
本函數進行規劃求解。 
3 產能規劃模式 
本研究之主要目的為：在半導體製造產業製程技
術世代轉換的問題中，考量需求與技術不確定因素，
提出一套整合策略與決策模式。如同先前所言，製程
技術世代的轉換，對 DRAM 產業而言是維持企業競爭
優勢的關鍵所在，再者，市場需求量短期來看或許會
有所增減，但就長期而言，市場需求大多呈現向上成
長的趨勢[8]。回顧過去整體半導體製造產業的發展歷
程，即使在市場需求萎縮的時期，企業大都還是選擇
繼續將其製程技術世代往前推升，因此，技術世代轉
換的決策制訂，關鍵因素將會是產業內的技術演進藍
圖；然而，市場需求的波動卻會影響企業推升技術世
代的速度，進而影響製程產能設置的策略。 
就前述研究背景所言，過去的先進製程轉換策略
或產能規劃模式都將未來需求變化視為最重要之不確
定因素，但需求變化的預測是一項困難且準確度不高
規劃之行為，將此預測結果作為策略規劃中最重要的
因子，將會使其投資風險大為提高。此外，技術世代
轉換對於企業而言是一種中、長程的規劃活動，而如
同前面所言，若將時間軸拉長，市場需求將會呈現較
為穩定的成長趨勢，而此成長趨勢除了受大環境的經
濟因素影響而偏移之外，最重要的偏移原因將來自於
新科技或技術的突破性發展[6]。因此，本研究將以未
來技術藍圖的發展作為技術世代轉換策略的主要考量
因子，輔以針對市場需求變化趨勢與科技發展時程產
生偏移進行技術世代轉換速率的調整，以滿足企業維
持競爭力並兼顧市場波動的目標。 
3.1 制定技術轉換開始時點 
在半導體製造產業中，相較於市場需求的劇烈波動，
技術發展歷程可算是呈現較為穩定成長的趨勢。例
如，早在 1965 年即提出的摩爾定律(每顆 IC 可容納之
電晶體數量約每 12 個月將增加一倍，1975 年修正為
18 個月、1997 年修正為 24 個月)，時至今日仍然適用，
圖 1 所示的資料為 1971 至 2008 每顆 IC 尚可容納之電
晶體數量，可以發現其關係準確地吻合摩爾定律的預

Keywords: Technology migration, DRAM, Technology roadmap, Learning curve. 
Abstract: Due to short life cycle of DRAM industry over the past decade, the product generation and technology 
migration have to be quickly enhanced. When technology migration occurred, DRAM companies always 
used the past experiences to proceed with process changes. However, the issues are totally different 
particularly in the best practice of technology migration that caused the companies suffered many 
uncertainties. In this work, a model to determine the timing of technology migration is proposed. The model 
is based on technology roadmap to set the timing of migration under maximum profit condition. A stable 
growth trend is assumed for market demand to decide the revenue. Furthermore, the time-cost function of 
new generational equipment and the theory of learning curve are introduced as the factors to determine the 
manufacturing cost and profit. Consequentially, the best timing is determined with maximum profit. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
DRAM industry is a capital intensive, high-tech 
industry with complex processes and technology 
migration for DRAM manufacturers has been a very 
challenging aspect and more time consuming. Since 
there is no any physical capacity expansion over the 
past 5 years in Taiwan, all DRAM manufacturers 
were relying more than ever on technology 
migration to increase supply and reduce cost. 
Furthermore, product generation and technology had 
been quickly enhanced due to short product life 
cycle. When new technology emerges, it reveals that 
a lower cost and more effective operation model 
emerged [Cainarca, 1989]. Simultaneously, it also 
means the current competitive advantages of the 
company will be jeopardized [Hastings, 1994]. 
Under this circumstance, manufactures have to 
launch new technology and retrofit generational 
equipment to meet the market demand and reduce 
manufacturing cost. Chou et al. pointed out the 
technology life cycle of semiconductor 
manufacturing usually won’t be over three years and 
the time of technology generational transition should 
take about nine months. Therefore, the 
semiconductor manufacturers always face the 
dilemma between capacity expansion and new 
technology migration. Generally, the major 
competition factor of DRAM industry is the 
manufacturing cost. That is why the frequency of 
technology migration is higher than foundries. 
There are many researches regarding to the 
influence of new technology introducing.  Chand 
and Sethi based on the enhancement of process 
stability by the new generational equipment to plan 
the replacement of new generation capacity. 
However, the impacts on the other factors and the 
lead time of replacement were not taken into account. 
Cohen and Halperin proposed a method to determine 
the timing of technology migration which was based 
on the price changes of new equipment as well as its 
impact on the cost to find the best timing for 
migration. Rajagopalan et al. combined the above 
two studies and proposed a capacity planning model 
under the impact of technology evolution. The linear 
programming was applied and the concept of 
timeline was added to the decision of capacity 
expansion or replacement decisions. Pak et al. 
proposed a methodology of capacity planning which 
focused on the capacity shortage to plan the capacity 
requirement and the influence from cost of new 
technology capacity was taken into account. 
Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis was applied to 
determine how sensitive of this plan in the changes 
of market demand. Chien and Zheng proposed a 
mini–max regret strategy for capacity planning 
under demand uncertainty to improve capacity 
utilization and capital effectiveness in 
semiconductor manufacturing. Seta et al. studied 
  
means the revenue of n periods. If the new 
technology is migrated at t period, the revenue from 
current technology will be the revenue from period 1 
to period t-1 and the revenue from new technology 
will be from period t to period n. Down below is the 
equation of current technology revenue andnew 
technology revenue. 
2.1.1 The Revenue from Current Technology 
If the current technology is not eliminated after 
new technology emerged, the current technology is 
still under production. Because the current 
technology is under a stable stage, the market price 
and production quantity of the company will keep 
almost the same. Therefore, the revenue from 
current technology is established as follows. 
     ∑(           )
   
   
 (2)  
Where 
    ： The average market price of 
g-1 generation technology 
      ： The total quantity of g-1 
generation technology at 
period i 
2.1.2 The Revenue from New Technology 
The calculation of the revenue from new 
technology is still formula by the price multiplying 
the quantity. Due to the new technology belonging 
to the growing stage, the market price and 
production quantity of the company will be changed 
by time. Based on the historical data analysis, the 
market price can be modelled as a Sigmoid function. 
The output of Sigmoid function is between 0 and 1. 
Therefore, the managers should forecast the rate of 
price change and the saddle point of price curve. 
Besides, the normalization is used to fit the actual 
DRAM price. Regarding to the production quantity, 
due to the unfamiliarity of new technology process, 
the yield of products will be lower in the beginning. 
After a period of time, the yield can be improved 
and products quantity will be increased as well. This 
concept is similar to the learning curve. Therefore, 
the concept of learning curve is applied to model the 
production quantity of new technology. The 
equation of the revenue from new technology is as 
follows. 
   ∑(         
 
   
) (3)  
     𝑋  (           )        
(4)  
𝑋  
 
    (   )
 
(5)  
      (  (    (     )
     
    )) 
(6)  
Where 
    ： The average price of g generation 
technology at i period 
     ： The maximum price of g generation 
technology 
     ： The minimum price of g generation 
technology 
𝑋： The normalization value of Sigmoid 
function 
 ： The rate of price change 
 ： The saddle point of Sigmoid function 
  ： Production quantity at i period 
  ： Release quantity per period 
   ： The initial failure rate of new 
technology 
  ： The learning rate of production 
failure rate, set by the managers 
 
2.2 The Function of Total Cost 
As the characteristics of DRAM industry, the 
company can get more profit from new generation 
technology. However, a huge of cost should be paid 
for new generational equipment behind profit. This 
cost is called as capacity acquired cost. Therefore, 
the calculation of production cost can be divided 
into two part, fixed cost and variable cost. The fixed 
cost is the cost of equipment for new technology and 
the depreciation of current equipment. There is no 
depreciation for the deposal equipment. The variable 
cost is the expense for the production. The details 
are as follows. 
2.2.1 Fixed Cost of New Technology 
Due to the migration to new generational 
technology, the new generational equipment is 
required. Generally, the price of new generational 
  
3.1.1 The Revenue from Current Technology 
Assume the price of current technology is $0.8 
per giga bit and production yield is 0.98. Therefore, 
the revenue from current technology is as follows. 
     ∑(                 )
 
   
             
             
3.1.2 The Revenue from New Technology 
Regarding to the price of DDRIII, the data from 
Aug. 2009 to July 2012 is collected to formula the 
Sigmoid function. Assume the parameters of 
Sigmoid function T is 16 and a is 0.3. The maximum 
and minimum price of DDRIII is 2.5 and 1.2. The 
price of new technology is as follows.  
  
 
       (    )
        
            (       )             
Due to the improvement of product yield, the 
production quantity will increase. Assume the 
product yield is 0.45 in the beginning of migration 
and c1 equals to 0.85. The production quantity of 
period 8 is calculated as follows.    
            
 ( 
 (    
 (   
  )       ))
            
   
      
    
        
The revenue from new technology is as follows. 
   ∑(         
  
   
)                
3.2 Total Cost 
3.2.1 Fixed Cost 
Assume the depreciation for equipment is six 
years. Three sets of g-1 generation should be 
replaced and their original cost is 0.1 billion. Total 
equipment cost of old technology excluding the 
disposals is 2 billion. The parameters of product by 
new and old technology are as follows. 
ICCg=1GB, CPg=1800, MPg=10000 
ICCg-1=1GB, CPg-1=1300, MPg-1=10000 
Therefore, Cg and Cg-1 equals to 18,000,000 and 
13,000,000. The new generational equipment 
quantity can be determined by Eq.  10. 
x  ⌊
        ÷       
        ÷     
⌋      
 
Assume the price of new generational equipment 
is 1 billion per set in the beginning and its residual 
value is 0.2 billion. Therefore, if the new 
generational equipment is purchased at period 8, 
its price is calculated as follows.

Production Planning and Control Model of Technology Migration 
for DRAM Industry 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
workstations and wafer release quantity (Iwata, Y., 
Taji, K. and Tamura, H., 2003; Walid and Gharbi, 
2002; Chou and You, 2001). Nevertheless, the 
system uncertainty and the risk of investment are not 
taken into account. Besides, many researches 
focused on release policy (Glassey, C. R. and 
Resende, M. G. C., 1998a & 1998b; Wein, 1988, 
Lou, 1989a &1989b; Spearman, M. L., Woodruff, D. 
L., and Hopp, W. J., 1989&1992; Bowman, 2002; 
Hung & Leachman, 1996). Either opened-loop or 
closed loop policy is based on the normal production 
situation and does not think of the events of products 
generation changes, equipment retrofit and new 
equipment move-in. According to the shop floor 
control, many dispatching rules were developed to 
fulfil the purpose of higher production performance 
(Dabbas & Flowler, 2003; Lee & Kim, 2011; Louw 
& Page, 2004; Hsieh & Hou, 2006; Hung and Chang, 
2002; Uzsoy et al., 1992). Nevertheless, the issues 
of process migration were not considered either in 
the release policy nor shop floor control rule. In 
general, the production system will be more 
complicated during the technology migration period, 
such as the instability of products mix, the changes 
of capacity. Therefore, the proposed methods won’t 
be satisfied the requirements. Moreover, the 
experiences of semiconductor management showed 
that the production management will be extremely 
complicated when there are over three generation 
products produced in the same time. System 
performance will be difficult to keep in such a 
circumstance. Hence, an efficient and effective 
planning and shop floor control model for a varied 
system can not only solve the technology migration 
issues but also be applied to the foundry with 
multiple generation products.    
This paper investigates the technology migration of 
DRAM industry from manufacturing point of view. 
In this work, a production planning and control 
model of technology migration was developed. 
There are two portions in this model including 
production planning and shop floor control. The 
production planning focused on CCR to define the 
complete wafer release schedule and applying X-
factor to schedule the production processes and 
equipment retrofit during the transition period. 
Regarding to the shop floor control, there are two 
control mechanisms to control and monitor the 
migration process, which are real time control and 
predicting control module.  
2 PRODUCTION PLANNING 
MODULE 
As mentioned above that the migration process has 
to fulfil the target of high-level strategy. The major 
decision factors of high-level strategy include the 
fluctuation of future demand, technology 
development and company financial situation. The 
complication and variation of production system are 
difficult to take into account in the strategy level. 
Therefore, a robust planning and control model not 
only can help to a successful migration process but 
also to find out various migration problems in 
advance. In production planning module, the major 
target is to transfer the output targets of new 
generational products to execution plan. The plan 
includes the wafer release plan of new/old 
generational products, the release plan of new 
generational equipment and equipment retrofit plan. 
Generally, the placement of new/old generational 
products will be progressed step by step. Hence, the 
migration period is divided into several time periods 
for planning. Furthermore, X-factor is applied to the 
scheduling process. The following is the procedure 
of production planning. 
Step 1. Set up the time unit 
It can be defined as a day, three hours…etc. 
Step 2. Plan wafer start schedule 
In this step, the wafer start schedule of new/old 
generational products should be planned by 
referring the output target of new generational 
products. Generally, top management will hope to 
keep the total output of factory as before. However, 
the manufacturing complexity of new generational 
products may be higher than old one and it will 
result to the total output decreasing. Therefore, the 
total output during migration period should be 
planned in this step. The sub-steps are as follows. 
1) Identify Capacity Constraint Resources (CCR) 
Generally, the CCR will be only one of 
equipment in a factory. However, due to the 
heavy investment of equipment, several 
workstations are highly utilized. If we assign 
the equipment with the highest utilization to be 
the CCR and based on this CCR to make all 
plans, the issue of bottleneck shifting will be 
occurred. Hence, multiple CCRs are suggested 
and can be the equipment with the utilization 
rate being higher than the predefined value.

3 SHOP FLOOR CONTROL 
MODULE 
Regarding to the shop floor control, there are two 
control mechanisms to control and monitor the 
migration process including real time control and 
predicting control module.  
 
3.1 Real Time Control Module 
Generally, WIP status is an important and 
sufficient information to reflect the production 
situation. If WIP level in front of workstation is too 
high, it reveals the capacity of this workstation is 
insufficient or there is something wrong in 
dispatching. Contrarily, low WIP level indicates 
some problems occurred in upstream workstations or 
wrong dispatching. Both situations cannot achieve 
the target of plan. In the real time control module, 
actual WIP level is taken as an indicator to judge the 
rescheduling mechanism should be launched or not. 
The buffer management concept of TOC is applied 
to control CCRs. Besides, the queuing theory and 
the capability of factory management are used to 
define the high and low control limits. When WIP 
level is over these limits, the response module will 
be triggered. The control limits are defined as the 
following equations.

3.2 Predicting Control Module 
As mentioned above, the real time control module 
is based on current shop floor information to 
diagnose the plan can be achieved or not. However, 
current shop floor status is the execution result. If 
the result is far away from the plan, the most 
possible action is to revise the plan. It seems behinds 
manager’s expectation. Therefore, a predicting 
control function is needed in the shop floor control 
module. In predicting control module, a foresee 
function will be performed which will trigger the 
response module when the bias between loading and 
capacity curves is over the predefined deviation 
tolerance (DT). The major task of the foresee 
function is to predict the production situation in the 
future. The deterministic simulation is applied to this 
function. Based on the deterministic simulation, the 
loading curves of CCRs by time can be defined. As 
to the capacity curves of CCRs, they can be derived 
from current capacity, the move-in schedule of new 
generational equipment and equipment retrofit plan. 
Fig. 3 is an example of equipment capacity curve 
and loading curve. Besides, as everyone knows that 
the accuracy of prediction will decrease as the time 
increasing. Therefore, the time factor should be 
considered into the bias tolerance. The equation for 
defining the deviation tolerance is as follows.

Technology migration is imperative for 
semiconductor manufacturing, particularly for 
DARM industry. The migration of technology will 
result in dramatic decreases in manufacturing cost 
and significantly increases competitive advantage. 
Nonetheless, how to guarantee a smooth and 
successful migration is very crucial. Therefore, the 
solution of the production planning and control of 
technology migration for DRAM industry is 
proposed in this work. There are two major modules

Model to Plan and Control the Generational Transition of DRAM 
Industry 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 when there are over three generation products produced in the same time. System performance will be 
difficult to keep in such a circumstance. Hence, an efficient and effective planning and control model 
for a varied system can not only solve the technology generational transition issues but also be 
applied to the foundry with multiple generational products. 
Production Plan for Generational Transition 
Generally, production planning of technology generational transition should consider the planning 
result of high-level strategy, such as the start time of migration, output target of new 
technology…etc., to set the migration tempo and capacity switching schedule. Nevertheless, the 
uncertainties and dynamic factors of shop floor (ex: machine breakdown, schedule delay for new 
generational equipment…etc.) can’t be taken into consideration in the high-level strategy. Besides, 
the high-level decision is based on the prediction of technology roadmap, there will be some changes 
between the setup of high-level strategy and the execution of migration process. In order to guarantee 
a smooth and successful migration process, a robust and effective production planning and control 
model of shop floor for technology migration is very important. 
The five steps of Theory of Constraints (TOC) are applied to make the release plan and capacity 
plan. The details are as follows. 
Step 1. Identify the constraint   
Generally, the most expensive equipment will be taken as the capacity constraint resource 
(CCR) in semiconductor manufacturing. As this aspect, the immersion scanner will be the CCR and 
taken as the bases to arrange the release plan of new/old products. 
Step 2 - Exploit the constraint- calculate the release mix of new/old products 
In order to fully utilize the constraint, the release schedule of new/old products should be well 
planned. There are two kinds of information have to prepare in advance, the release plan of new 
generational equipment and the cycle time information of new products. The release plan of new 
generational equipment comes from the planning result of high-level strategy. However, there is no 
any historical data for the cycle time information of new products. Therefore, X-factor is applied to 
estimate the cycle time data. The following is the procedure for release schedule. 
Step 2.1. Calculate the monthly production quantity of bottleneck for new product 
The monthly production quantity of bottleneck machine will be the total available hours to 
divide by the summation of processing time of new product.

In these equations, CPM means the monthly production quantity of bottleneck machine. D is the 
days per month; H is hours per day; EQ means the equipment quantity of bottleneck machine; U 
represents the uptime of bottleneck machine; E is the efficiency of operations; PTi represents the 
processing time of the ith traveling the bottleneck and there is n times to travel to the bottleneck. 
Finally, P means the pieces of wafer per lot. The daily release quantity, CPD, can be easily get from 
the monthly production quantity dividing by the days per month. 
Step 2.2. Decide the monthly production quantity of old product 
As mentioned above, the monthly output target will be plan by high level production plan. 
Therefore, when the monthly production quantity of new product is decided, the quantity of old 
product can be calculated by total monthly output subtracting the quantity of new product.  
Step 2.3. Schedule the release plan of new/old products 
The release date of new/old products can be scheduled just offsetting the schedule out date by the 
cycle time of product.  
 
 
 
Advanced Materials Research Vols. 694-697 3459
 Step 1. Calculate the bottleneck loading from daily plan release  
The bottleneck loading comes from the daily release wafer will be the multiplying result of the daily 
release quantity (P), the standard cycle time from the release to ith traveling bottleneck m (CTmi) and 
the processing time of bottleneck (PTmi). The equation is as follows. 
($) = ∑ ( × ) × ))

Step 2. Calculate the bottleneck loading from actual WIP  
The bottleneck loading comes from the actual WIP can be calculated by the multiplying of the 
summation of WIP loading (Ami), and the processing time of bottleneck (PTmi). The WIP is the WIP 
quantity located at j point multiplying by the standard cycle time from j to ith traveling bottleneck m. 
The equation is as follows. 
*$) = ∑ (*) × ))

                                                                                                       (7) 
Step 3. Make a decision of wafer release  
The workload ratio (WR) is defined as SCCRm divided by ACCRm. If WR is greater than one, the 
decision of stop release will be executed, else, follow the original release plan. 
Conclusions 
Technology generational transition is an important process for DRAM industry. If there is no any 
special planning and control methodology designed for the transition process, it will suffer many 
difficulties. In this work, the concept of TOC is applied to schedule the production plan of the 
new/old products. Regarding to shop floor control, three definitions of cycle time are used to 
diagnose the production status. Finally, the workload ratio of bottleneck is used for the release 
decision to adjust the rhythm of production.

workstations and wafer release quantity (Iwata, Y., 
Taji, K. and Tamura, H., 2003; Walid and Gharbi, 
2002; Chou and You, 2001). Nevertheless, the 
system uncertainty and the risk of investment are not 
taken into account. Besides, many researches 
focused on release policy (Glassey, C. R. and 
Resende, M. G. C., 1998a & 1998b; Wein, 1988, 
Lou, 1989a &1989b; Spearman, M. L., Woodruff, D. 
L., and Hopp, W. J., 1989&1992; Bowman, 2002; 
Hung & Leachman, 1996). Either opened-loop or 
closed loop policy is based on the normal production 
situation and does not think of the events of products 
generation changes, equipment retrofit and new 
equipment move-in. According to the shop floor 
control, many dispatching rules were developed to 
fulfil the purpose of higher production performance 
(Dabbas & Flowler, 2003; Lee & Kim, 2011; Louw 
& Page, 2004; Hsieh & Hou, 2006; Hung and Chang, 
2002; Uzsoy et al., 1992). Nevertheless, the issues 
of process migration were not considered either in 
the release policy nor shop floor control rule. In 
general, the production system will be more 
complicated during the technology migration period, 
such as the instability of products mix, the changes 
of capacity. Therefore, the proposed methods won’t 
be satisfied the requirements. Moreover, the 
experiences of semiconductor management showed 
that the production management will be extremely 
complicated when there are over three generation 
products produced in the same time. System 
performance will be difficult to keep in such a 
circumstance. Hence, an efficient and effective 
planning and shop floor control model for a varied 
system can not only solve the technology migration 
issues but also be applied to the foundry with 
multiple generation products.    
This paper investigates the technology migration of 
DRAM industry from manufacturing point of view. 
In this work, a production planning and control 
model of technology migration was developed. 
There are two portions in this model including 
production planning and shop floor control. The 
production planning focused on CCR to define the 
complete wafer release schedule and applying X-
factor to schedule the production processes and 
equipment retrofit during the transition period. 
Regarding to the shop floor control, there are two 
control mechanisms to control and monitor the 
migration process, which are real time control and 
predicting control module.  
2 PRODUCTION PLANNING 
MODULE 
As mentioned above that the migration process has 
to fulfil the target of high-level strategy. The major 
decision factors of high-level strategy include the 
fluctuation of future demand, technology 
development and company financial situation. The 
complication and variation of production system are 
difficult to take into account in the strategy level. 
Therefore, a robust planning and control model not 
only can help to a successful migration process but 
also to find out various migration problems in 
advance. In production planning module, the major 
target is to transfer the output targets of new 
generational products to execution plan. The plan 
includes the wafer release plan of new/old 
generational products, the release plan of new 
generational equipment and equipment retrofit plan. 
Generally, the placement of new/old generational 
products will be progressed step by step. Hence, the 
migration period is divided into several time periods 
for planning. Furthermore, X-factor is applied to the 
scheduling process. The following is the procedure 
of production planning. 
Step 1. Set up the time unit 
It can be defined as a day, three hours…etc. 
Step 2. Plan wafer start schedule 
In this step, the wafer start schedule of new/old 
generational products should be planned by 
referring the output target of new generational 
products. Generally, top management will hope to 
keep the total output of factory as before. However, 
the manufacturing complexity of new generational 
products may be higher than old one and it will 
result to the total output decreasing. Therefore, the 
total output during migration period should be 
planned in this step. The sub-steps are as follows. 
1) Identify Capacity Constraint Resources (CCR) 
Generally, the CCR will be only one of 
equipment in a factory. However, due to the 
heavy investment of equipment, several 
workstations are highly utilized. If we assign 
the equipment with the highest utilization to be 
the CCR and based on this CCR to make all 
plans, the issue of bottleneck shifting will be 
occurred. Hence, multiple CCRs are suggested 
and can be the equipment with the utilization 
rate being higher than the predefined value. 
2) Calculate capacity consumption rate of CCRs 
by new and old generational products 
Because the new/old generational products will 
be processed by the same equipment, the 
  
3 SHOP FLOOR CONTROL 
MODULE 
Regarding to the shop floor control, there are two 
control mechanisms to control and monitor the 
migration process including real time control and 
predicting control module.  
 
3.1 Real Time Control Module 
Generally, WIP status is an important and 
sufficient information to reflect the production 
situation. If WIP level in front of workstation is too 
high, it reveals the capacity of this workstation is 
insufficient or there is something wrong in 
dispatching. Contrarily, low WIP level indicates 
some problems occurred in upstream workstations or 
wrong dispatching. Both situations cannot achieve 
the target of plan. In the real time control module, 
actual WIP level is taken as an indicator to judge the 
rescheduling mechanism should be launched or not. 
The buffer management concept of TOC is applied 
to control CCRs. Besides, the queuing theory and 
the capability of factory management are used to 
define the high and low control limits. When WIP 
level is over these limits, the response module will 
be triggered. The control limits are defined as the 
following equations.

As mentioned above, the real time control module 
is based on current shop floor information to 
diagnose the plan can be achieved or not. However, 
current shop floor status is the execution result. If 
the result is far away from the plan, the most

module. In predicting control module, a foresee 
function will be performed which will trigger the 
response module when the bias between loading and 
capacity curves is over the predefined deviation 
tolerance (DT). The major task of the foresee 
function is to predict the production situation in the 
future. The deterministic simulation is applied to this 
function. Based on the deterministic simulation, the 
loading curves of CCRs by time can be defined. As 
to the capacity curves of CCRs, they can be derived 
from current capacity, the move-in schedule of new 
generational equipment and equipment retrofit plan. 
Fig. 3 is an example of equipment capacity curve

the accuracy of prediction will decrease as the time

considered into the bias tolerance. The equation for

Abstract. DRAM industry is not only among the largest manufacturing industries in the world, but 
also the most competitive. Furthermore, due to DRAM business is characterized by short life cycles, 
along with highly competition, the manufacturers are forced to migrate to advanced technology 
quickly. Under this circumstance, the manufacturers have to launch new technology and purchase 
generational equipment to meet the market demand and reduce manufacturing cost frequently.  
This paper investigates the technology generational transition of DRAM industry from 
manufacturing and planning perspectives. The concept of TOC is applied to schedule the production 
plan of the new/old products. Regarding to shop floor control, three definitions of cycle time are used 
to diagnose the production status. Finally, the workload ratio of bottleneck is used for the release 
decision to adjust the rhythm of production. 
Introduction 
DRAM industry is a capital-intensive, high-tech industry with complicated manufacturing process. 
Due to the short product life cycle, product generation and technology had been forced to quickly 
enhance.  When new technology emerges, it reveals a lower cost and more effective operation model 
[1]. Therefore, manufactures have to launch new technology and retrofit generational equipment to 
meet the market demand and reduce manufacturing cost. Besides, as the characteristic of DRAM, the 
objective of production plan is to maximize the shipment. Consequently, “make to stock” is the 
general production type. The target of production will be guided to maximize the utilization of 
equiment to increase the total output. It will make more profit for the comany in the uptrend. However, 
when the supply exceeds the demand or the technology migrates quickly, this production mode will 
result in some issues, such as the difficulties of  production scheduling, a fault of bottleneck 
identification and cycle time out of control. After the financial crisis in 2008, DRAM industry is 
coming to the micro-profit era with quick evolution of product generation. Under such a circumstance, 
DRAM manufacturing company should phase in new generation technology and phase out the 
current technology rapidly, otherwise, the company will get into plights. Therefore, a planning and 
control model to expedite the process of technology generational transition with low inventory and 
cost is very important.   
There are many researches about the methods for production planning and shop floor control of 
semiconductor manufacturing had been proposed. Queuing theory, linear programming and mean 
value analysis are usually applied to estimate the capacity requirement of workstations and wafer 
release quantity[2,3]. Nevertheless, system uncertainty and the risk of investment are not taken into 
account. Besides, many researches focused on release policy [4,5,6]. Either opened-loop or closed 
loop policy is based on the normal production situation and does not think of the events of products 
generational transitions, equipment retrofit and new equipment move-in. According to the shop floor 
control, many dispatching rules were developed to fulfill the purpose of higher production 
performance [7,8]. Nevertheless, issues of process migration were not considered either in the release 
policy nor shop floor control rule. In general, the production system will be more complicated during 
the technology migration period, such as the instability of products mix, the changes of capacity. 
Therefore, the proposed methods won’t be satisfied the requirements. Moreover, the experiences of 
semiconductor management showed that the production management will be extremely complicated

 Step 3 - Subordinate to the constraint.  
All workstations should be investigated their workloads of the planning horizon to make sure the 
feasibility of the schedule in Step 2.  In order to calculate the workload, the current WIP and release 
schedule products within the planning horizon should be pre-scheduled by penetration rate of 
products. If there is any workstation overloaded, an alternative solution should be proposed.     
Step 4 - Elevate the constraint. 
In the transition period, the step 1 to 3 should be repeated continuously until the system reaching a 
point where the bottleneck has been exploited or squeezed to its maximum. At this point, the new 
equipment is invested, and this as known as “elevation” of the constraint.  
Step 5 - Do not let Inertia become the constraint. 
Once the constraint has been elevated, the constraint will move to a new point in the system! The 
system therefore cannot be managed the same way as before and Step 1 must be revisited.  
Shop Floor Control System for the Generational Transition Process  
There are two modules, cycle time control and production rhythm control, proposing in the shop floor 
control system to well manage the production process in the transition period.  
Cycle Time Control Module  
Cycle time is one of the key factors of the competition, especial for semiconductor industry. 
Meyerdorf &Yang [9] mentioned that there are at least two critical issues caused by long cycle times. 
First, the long cycle times will lead to the detection of the faults and error in process or equipment 
protracted. Second, the long cycle times will result in the low yield. Therefore, to well manage the 
product cycle time is very important for shop floor control. Generally, there are three kinds of 
definition for cycle time, output cycle time, in line cycle time and turn rate cycle time.  
Output cycle time:    
The output cycle time is the total time that a product stayed in a fab and can be calculated by the 
release date subtracting from the output date. Actually, it is a result of production and can be regarded 
as a past performance index. From this index the managers can realize the production performance 
and find out the deviation of dispatching system. The output cycle time is calculated by the following 
equation. Where F means the output date, I is the release date and B represent the days in bank. 
 =  −  −                                                                                                                       (3) 
In line cycle time: 
 The in line cycle time is the summation of the daily average cycle time of all workstations which 
includes the processing time, transportation time and queue time of the workstations. This index is a 
result of daily operations. Therefore, it can be taken as a present performance index and be reviewed 
and find out the operation issues in time. The formula is as follows. Where n is the total process steps, 
PTi is the processing time of step i, TTi means the transportation time of step i and QTi is the queue 
time of step i. 
 = ∑ (

 +  + ")                                                                                                 (4) 
Turn rate cycle time: 
The turn rate cycle time is the product cycle time which is estimated by process turn rate. It is a 
forecast data and can be regarded as a future performance index.  Based on this index, we can judge 
that if the move quantity and WIP level of workstation still under control. The equation of the index is 
as follows.

Production Rhythm Control Module  
The rhythm of production is very important for shop floor control. As everyone knows, bottleneck is 
the constraint of factory throughput. Based on the concepts of TOC, all non-bottlenecks should 
subordinate to the bottleneck’s needs, ensuring the bottleneck is able to focus on doing only what it is 
meant to. Therefore, all operations should subordinate the rhythm of the bottleneck to release the 
wafer to fab. The following is the procedure for wafer release control.

Keywords: Technology migration, DRAM, Technology roadmap, Learning curve. 
Abstract: Due to short life cycle of DRAM industry over the past decade, the product generation and technology 
migration have to be quickly enhanced. When technology migration occurred, DRAM companies always 
used the past experiences to proceed with process changes. However, the issues are totally different 
particularly in the best practice of technology migration that caused the companies suffered many 
uncertainties. In this work, a model to determine the timing of technology migration is proposed. The model 
is based on technology roadmap to set the timing of migration under maximum profit condition. A stable 
growth trend is assumed for market demand to decide the revenue. Furthermore, the time-cost function of 
new generational equipment and the theory of learning curve are introduced as the factors to determine the 
manufacturing cost and profit. Consequentially, the best timing is determined with maximum profit. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
DRAM industry is a capital intensive, high-tech 
industry with complex processes and technology 
migration for DRAM manufacturers has been a very 
challenging aspect and more time consuming. Since 
there is no any physical capacity expansion over the 
past 5 years in Taiwan, all DRAM manufacturers 
were relying more than ever on technology 
migration to increase supply and reduce cost. 
Furthermore, product generation and technology had 
been quickly enhanced due to short product life 
cycle. When new technology emerges, it reveals that 
a lower cost and more effective operation model 
emerged [Cainarca, 1989]. Simultaneously, it also 
means the current competitive advantages of the 
company will be jeopardized [Hastings, 1994]. 
Under this circumstance, manufactures have to 
launch new technology and retrofit generational 
equipment to meet the market demand and reduce 
manufacturing cost. Chou et al. pointed out the 
technology life cycle of semiconductor 
manufacturing usually won’t be over three years and 
the time of technology generational transition should 
take about nine months. Therefore, the 
semiconductor manufacturers always face the 
dilemma between capacity expansion and new 
technology migration. Generally, the major 
competition factor of DRAM industry is the 
manufacturing cost. That is why the frequency of 
technology migration is higher than foundries. 
There are many researches regarding to the 
influence of new technology introducing.  Chand 
and Sethi based on the enhancement of process 
stability by the new generational equipment to plan 
the replacement of new generation capacity. 
However, the impacts on the other factors and the 
lead time of replacement were not taken into account. 
Cohen and Halperin proposed a method to determine 
the timing of technology migration which was based 
on the price changes of new equipment as well as its 
impact on the cost to find the best timing for 
migration. Rajagopalan et al. combined the above 
two studies and proposed a capacity planning model 
under the impact of technology evolution. The linear 
programming was applied and the concept of 
timeline was added to the decision of capacity 
expansion or replacement decisions. Pak et al. 
proposed a methodology of capacity planning which 
focused on the capacity shortage to plan the capacity 
requirement and the influence from cost of new 
technology capacity was taken into account. 
Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis was applied to 
determine how sensitive of this plan in the changes 
of market demand. Chien and Zheng proposed a 
mini–max regret strategy for capacity planning 
under demand uncertainty to improve capacity 
utilization and capital effectiveness in 
semiconductor manufacturing. Seta et al. studied 
  
means the revenue of n periods. If the new 
technology is migrated at t period, the revenue from 
current technology will be the revenue from period 1 
to period t-1 and the revenue from new technology 
will be from period t to period n. Down below is the 
equation of current technology revenue andnew 
technology revenue. 
2.1.1 The Revenue from Current Technology 
If the current technology is not eliminated after 
new technology emerged, the current technology is 
still under production. Because the current 
technology is under a stable stage, the market price 
and production quantity of the company will keep 
almost the same. Therefore, the revenue from 
current technology is established as follows. 
     ∑(           )
   
   
 (2)  
Where 
    ： The average market price of 
g-1 generation technology 
      ： The total quantity of g-1 
generation technology at 
period i 
2.1.2 The Revenue from New Technology 
The calculation of the revenue from new 
technology is still formula by the price multiplying 
the quantity. Due to the new technology belonging 
to the growing stage, the market price and 
production quantity of the company will be changed 
by time. Based on the historical data analysis, the 
market price can be modelled as a Sigmoid function. 
The output of Sigmoid function is between 0 and 1. 
Therefore, the managers should forecast the rate of 
price change and the saddle point of price curve. 
Besides, the normalization is used to fit the actual 
DRAM price. Regarding to the production quantity, 
due to the unfamiliarity of new technology process, 
the yield of products will be lower in the beginning. 
After a period of time, the yield can be improved 
and products quantity will be increased as well. This 
concept is similar to the learning curve. Therefore, 
the concept of learning curve is applied to model the 
production quantity of new technology. The 
equation of the revenue from new technology is as 
follows.

technology at i period 
     ： The maximum price of g generation

     ： The minimum price of g generation

𝑋： The normalization value of Sigmoid

 ： The rate of price change 
 ： The saddle point of Sigmoid function 
  ： Production quantity at i period 
  ： Release quantity per period 
   ： The initial failure rate of new 
technology 
  ： The learning rate of production 
failure rate, set by the managers 
 
2.2 The Function of Total Cost 
As the characteristics of DRAM industry, the 
company can get more profit from new generation 
technology. However, a huge of cost should be paid 
for new generational equipment behind profit. This 
cost is called as capacity acquired cost. Therefore, 
the calculation of production cost can be divided 
into two part, fixed cost and variable cost. The fixed 
cost is the cost of equipment for new technology and 
the depreciation of current equipment. There is no 
depreciation for the deposal equipment. The variable 
cost is the expense for the production. The details 
are as follows. 
2.2.1 Fixed Cost of New Technology 
Due to the migration to new generational 
technology, the new generational equipment is 
required. Generally, the price of new generational 
  
3.1.1 The Revenue from Current Technology 
Assume the price of current technology is $0.8 
per giga bit and production yield is 0.98. Therefore, 
the revenue from current technology is as follows. 
     ∑(                 )
 
   
             
             
3.1.2 The Revenue from New Technology 
Regarding to the price of DDRIII, the data from 
Aug. 2009 to July 2012 is collected to formula the 
Sigmoid function. Assume the parameters of 
Sigmoid function T is 16 and a is 0.3. The maximum 
and minimum price of DDRIII is 2.5 and 1.2. The 
price of new technology is as follows.  
  
 
       (    )
        
            (       )             
Due to the improvement of product yield, the 
production quantity will increase. Assume the 
product yield is 0.45 in the beginning of migration 
and c1 equals to 0.85. The production quantity of 
period 8 is calculated as follows.    
            
 ( 
 (    
 (   
  )       ))
            
   
      
    
        
The revenue from new technology is as follows. 
   ∑(         
  
   
)                
3.2 Total Cost 
3.2.1 Fixed Cost 
Assume the depreciation for equipment is six 
years. Three sets of g-1 generation should be 
replaced and their original cost is 0.1 billion. Total 
equipment cost of old technology excluding the 
disposals is 2 billion. The parameters of product by 
new and old technology are as follows. 
ICCg=1GB, CPg=1800, MPg=10000 
ICCg-1=1GB, CPg-1=1300, MPg-1=10000 
Therefore, Cg and Cg-1 equals to 18,000,000 and 
13,000,000. The new generational equipment 
quantity can be determined by Eq.  10. 
x  ⌊
        ÷       
        ÷     
⌋      
 
Assume the price of new generational equipment 
is 1 billion per set in the beginning and its residual 
value is 0.2 billion. Therefore, if the new 
generational equipment is purchased at period 8, 
its price is calculated as follows.

Based on the assumptions above, the total fixed 
cost is calculated as follows.
