Ion beam studies of InAs/GaAs quantum dots after annealing
Abstract
The microstructure changes of self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots during RTA treatment
was investigated using ion channeling and photoluminescence (PL). A small blueshift of the PL
emission is observed for annealing temperatures of 650-800 ℃ and an obvious blueshift at 850
℃. The yield of channeled spectra decreased as annealing temperature was increased, but the
yield increased while temperature above 800 ℃ in RTA. These results imply the strain of QD
varied during RTA treatments. In addition, the As/Ga atomic ratio near the surface was
determined from the surface peaks of the channeled spectrum.
Introduction
Self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been used extensively in
optoelectronic devices, such as semiconductor lasers and detectors [1-3]. The physical properties
of the dots are strongly dependent on the strain caused by the lattice mismatch between materials
(here InAs and GaAs). Thermal annealing is a way to tune the structure parameters of QDs, such
as their composition, strain and size distribution [4]. The structural changes induced by thermal
annealing cause changes in the QD’s interband transition as wel as intersublevel space energy. 
Generally, such a procedure leads to blueshift and narrowing in the QD’s photoluminescence (PL)
spectrum. However, analysis of QD’s structure is dificult due to its ultra thin profile, being
capped with a GaAs layer as well as its three dimension structure.
Ion channeling is a powerful technique for probing structure of thin films. It has long been
used in analyzing atomic ordering in crystal structures and has been successfully applied for the
study of strain in buried QDs. Previous reports have demonstrated that the strain and
interdiffision of QDs can be studied from angular scan curves in ion channeling measurements
[5,6]. In this work, the strain relaxation of the QDs after thermal annealing was studied using
RBS/channeling aligned energy spectra in both <100> and <110> directions.
Experiment
The InAs quantum dots studied in this work were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on
dechanneled if the continuity of the channel is disrupted at the interface between dots and layers.
This provides us the opportunity to look at the thin QD layer strain change after thermal
treatment.
Figure 2a and 2b show the RBS/w channeling spectra of the samples along the <100> and
<110> directions, respectively. The aligned spectrum of GaAs wafer was also plotted as a
reference. The yields of samples with InAs QDs were higher than the GaAs reference, implied
some crystal distortion in the samples. Interestingly, the yields of aligned spectra in both
directions did not vary monotonically with the thermal treatment temperature. Below 750 C˚, the
yields decreased as temperature increased, approaching to the GaAs reference. This behavior is
similar to the ion implanted samples during the annealing process, namely, solid phase epitaxial
re-growth. Some defects in samples are recovered by thermal annealing. Above 750˚C, the yields 
increased surprisingly with an abrupt increase observed at 850˚C. The yield increase indicated
that the channeled ions underwent dechanneling when they passed through the InAs layer. This
implied that the atoms in InAs layer displaced from their lattice sites and interdiffused with
surrounding GaAs. Furthermore, the channeled yield of 850˚C annealed sampleis higher than
as-grown sample along <110> direction, but not along <100>, indicated that the vertical
displacement, along growth direction, is larger than horizontal displacement. It evidence
tentatively the former cubic InAs dots mixed with surrounding GaAs and gradually to become
InxGa1-xAs with tetragonal distortion after high temperature annealing.
Figure 3 shows 25K PL spectra of samples before and after annealing. Below 800˚C, there is 
only a little blueshift. But a significant blueshift was observed at 850˚C. From the channeling
result, we know that annealing causes the capping and buffer GaAs layer to restore and strain of
the QDs to relax. Strain relaxation should result in a redshift inof the PL measurement due to
band gap shrinkage. However, the results of PL measurements show a clear blueshift. The band
gap energy is influenced by both strain and composition. However, we can deduce only the
information on microstructure change of the QDs from dechanneling effect, but cannot gather any
composition information because of the depth resolution limit in this work. Therefore, the
explanation for this contradistinction between PL and channeling results might be attributed to
the composition intermixing between the QDs and the surrounding GaAs during annealing.

場外有許多拉客的計程車，非常吵雜。還好同行伙伴已訂好接機的交通工具，因為正逢當
地慶典(宗教)，所以沿路有各種遊行活動，很像台灣廟會活動。
