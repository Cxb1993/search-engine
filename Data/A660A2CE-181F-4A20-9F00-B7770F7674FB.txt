(2) 英文摘要 
The broadband nature of Cr
4+
 ion has attracted researchers worldwide to 
develop Cr doped fibers. Up to now, Cr
4+
:YAG crystal fiber grown by laser heated 
pedestal growth method has generated the highest fluorescence efficiency. Using 
drawing tower to fabricate Cr doped fibers has larger commercial potential because of 
its fast pulling speed. So far, it is not quite clear that the mechanisms that affect Cr
4+
 
efficiency in glass environment. For example, the effects of the possible tetrahedral 
sites that may exist in silica fibers, such as SiO2, (SiO4)
4-
, (Si2O7)
6-
, (Si6O18)
12-
, 
(Si2O6)
4-
, and (Si2O5)
2-
 clusters. In this proposal we plan to study it using a 
multi-wavelength confocal microscope and a near-field scanning optical microscope. 
In addition, the Cr doped fiber performs are usually using Cr2O3 and Al2O3 
glass with some CaO for charge compensation. We have used a rod-in-tube technique 
to prepare our fiber perform, which results in plenty Cr:-Al2O3 nano crystals (20-50 
nm in diameter) in the inner cladding. It is an inter-diffusion layer formed by YAG 
and silica glass. It would be interesting to know their fluorescence properties as well 
in order to find out better core and cladding compositions for higher efficiency. 
Since Cr ions belong to the transition metal group, the fluorescent spectra of its 
3d electrons are apt to environmental matrix. We will try to use tapered glass fiber tip 
or crystal fiber tips to perturb its local electric field, and see their effects on the 
fluorescent properties. Theoretical model will be developed and simulated. 
In the first year, we will try to achieve 100-nm resolution in near-field 
fluorescence measurement of the fiber core and cladding to find out the effects of the 
nano crystals. Different thermal anneal treatments will be tried to raise fluorescent 
efficiency. In the second year, we will try to enhance the spatial resolution to 50 nm 
using our home-made sapphire crystal fiber tip. The saturation properties of the nano 
crystals will also be studied. In the third year, we will try to integrate the confocal and 
near-field techniques to realize an apertureless near-field scanning optical microscope 
with even higher spatial resolution. The local field of the Cr ions will be modulated to 
probe their temporal response. 
 
II. Method 
 
The spatially resolved nanospectroscopy was performed by a modified NSOM 
(NT-MDT) system for analyzing the strained core, and nanocrystals and clusters in the 
 4 
Cr:YAG DCF. It shows a typical Cr
3+
:YAG emission spectra, which contains a sharp R line 
(688 nm; 
2E→4A2 transition) associated with three phonon sidebands (657, 707 and 726 
nm), demonstrating that the core is a single crystal YAG. The corresponding mapping of 
the R-line intensity is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. In longer wavelength region for 
positions 2 and 3, another weak broad band emission (750-850 nm; 
4
T2→
4
A2 transition) 
were first observed, suggesting that the Cr
3+
 ions occupy low crystal-field sites (LFSs) 
nearby the core/inner-cladding interface. It can be ascribed to the strain induced by the 
thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) difference between the YAG core and YAG/SiO2 
mixed inner cladding. The TECs of YAG core and silica outer cladding are 7.5×10
-6
 
o
C and 
0.5 × 10
-6
 
o
C, respectively; while the inner cladding should have a TEC between the core 
and outer cladding. This TEC mismatch causes the vicinity of core/inner-cladding be 
distorted with a compressive strain during the inter-diffusion process. To verify this, a 
spatially resolved near-field R-line mapping was conducted, shown in the inset of Fig. 2b. 
The distribution of R-line wavelength in the core is from 688.2 to 688.35 nm. The 
corresponding line-scan profiles are shown in Fig. 2b. Clearly, the R lines slightly shift to 
longer wavelength toward the core/inner cladding interface. This R-line evolution is 
consistent with that of ruby, indicating an increase of the compression in the vicinity of the 
core/inner-cladding interface, as evidence in the LFSs emission in Fig. 2a.

from 687.58 to 688.68 nm and 687.86 to 687.99 nm, respectively. As expected, the 
near-field R1 center wavelength mappings (Figs. 3d and 3h) clearly show the R1 line 
slightly shifts to a longer wavelength toward the core/inner-cladding interface. This 
indicates the TEC-difference-induced red-shift effect occurred at the periphery of the core 
edge. This R-line evolution is consistent with that of ruby, demonstrating an increase of the 
compression in the vicinity of the core/inner-cladding interface relative to the core center. 
Unexpectedly, however, an interference pattern, rather than the expected smooth 
distribution, is observed in the near-field images (Figs. 3b, 3c, 3f, and 3g). Such a pattern 
indicates several waveguide modes interfere with each other within the DCF strained core. 
Further, reasonable estimations for the strain variation K within the Cr:YAG core 
related to the R1-line shifts Δ can be obtained from the equation below, 
         113/112/1exp 320   KEDKDK S           (1)                                                
where 0 is the R1 center wavelength at ambient pressure, in the present case 0 = 687.86 
nm, determined by an undoped YAG single crystal. S, D, and E are constants of 0.3527, 
-4.266, and 668.7, respectively. Substituting equation (1) into Figures 3d and 3h, the strain 
distributions in two different orientations as a function of positions for various core 
diameters can be obtained. 
The measured near-field emission spectra of Cr
4+
:YAG obtained at RT, accompanied 
by the Cr
4+
 fluorescence mappings at 1350 nm are shown in Figs. 4a-4d (11-μm-diameter 
core) and 4e-4h (25-μm-diameter core). The Cr4+ fluorescence spectra and mappings were 
all acquired by PMT, and using an excitation from a 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser. The Cr
4+
 
fluorescence spectra range from 1100 to 1650 nm, extending over nearly 550 nm with a 
peak wavelength of ~1330 nm. This ultra-broadband emission is ascribed to the 
3
T2→
3
A2 
transition in Td symmetry, or more precisely, the 
3
B2(
3
T2)→
3
B1(
3
A2) transition in D2d 
symmetry. Note, the fluctuations above 1450 nm result from the partial transmissions of the 
filter utilized in the NSOM collection mode. Also, the waveguide mode patterns were 
apparently seen as observed in Cr
3+
 near-field fluorescence measurements. 
Figures 4a and 4e show the corresponding Cr
3+
 fluorescence intensity mappings for 
comparison, indicating most of the Cr
3+
 and Cr
4+
 fluorescence are concentrated within the 
core region. It is worthy of mentioning that unlike the Cr
3+
 fluorescence distributions, the 
Cr
4+
 fluorescence distributions have the opposite behaviors at the core edge. Namely, the 
core edge has the larger Cr
3+
 fluorescence intensity, whereas the core center has stronger 
Cr
4+
 fluorescence intensity.
