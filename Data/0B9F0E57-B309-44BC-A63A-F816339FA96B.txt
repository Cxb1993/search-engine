Abstract
Aerosol samples for dry deposition and total suspend particulates (TSP) were collected
from August to November of 2003 in central Taiwan. Ion chromatography was used to analyze
the related water-soluble ionic species (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+and Ca2+). The
results obtained in this study indicated that the ambient air particulate mass concentrations in the
daytime period (averaged 975.4 μgm-3) were higher than the nightime period (averaged 542.1μg
m-3). And the daytime dry deposition fluxes (averaged 58.12 μgm-2 sec-1) were about 2.2 times as
that of nightime dry deposition fluxes (averaged 26.54 μgm-2 sec-1) of the downward dry
deposition. The average values downward and upward of dry deposition fluxes for the weekend
period were almost higher than the weekday period for either daytime or nighttime period.
Furthermore, the average daytime dry deposition fluxes (averaged 26.37 μgm-2 sec-1) were also
about 2.3 times as that of nighttime dry deposition fluxes (averaged 11.52μgm-2 sec-1). Moreover,
the results also indicate that SO42- and Ca2+ have higher average composition for total suspended
particulates in the daytime period while Ca2+, SO42-, and Na+ have the higher average
composition for total suspends particulates in the nighttime period.
Introduction
Ambient suspended particle pollution is an important environmental issue worldwide doing
the past years. In addition, atmospheric deposition is a major source for chemical components to
ecosystems and there compositions are also affected by human activities. This transport process
occurs by three major pathways: (1) interception by coldwater, fog, and mist; (2) precipitation
scavenging, in which particles are incorporated in hydrometeors and deposited in the resulting
rain, snow, sleet or hail; and (3) dry deposition, in which large particles, aerosols and gases fall
on or are removed by surfaces in the ecosystem. Human activities have had a major effect on the
emission and subsequent deposition of constituents, e.g. acid deposition through combustion of
fossil fuels. Thus, it is important to assess trends in emissions and deposition and their relations,
particularly as human activities change. Anthropogenic acid precursor emissions in East Asia are
significantly and expected to last for next several years due to the use of fossil fuel burning
systems and the in creasing increase numbers in many Asian countries. Acidic aerosols have
drawn much attention of the investigators and technologists in the area of atmospheric
environment and public health. Human exposures to acidic aerosols in ambient air can cause
inevitably respiratory irritants, pulmonary disease and asthma. Acidic aerosol comes mainly from
the heterogeneous or homogeneous reactions of primary air pollutants such as NOx and. SO2. The
major emission sources of SO2 are the combustion of coal and fuel of industrial plants. The chief
sources of NOx are fossil-fuel combustion for industrial process, power plant and automobile
emissions. Many researches have investigated the composition and concentration of acidic
aerosol, the sulfate, and nitrate indicated that air pollutants could potentially lead to
cardiovascular disorders, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis/
emphysema, and other respiratory diseases. also indicated that measuring reflectance of
TSP-filters pollutants useful in retrospective epidemiological studies.

Table 1 displayed the sampling information which contains the sampling date, dry deposition
flux, TSP concentration, dry deposition velocity and meteorological data at the traffic sampling
site of central Taiwan during summer and autumn period of 2003. The average sampling
temperature was 28.3 , 24.6 for the daytime and nighttime period, respectively. The average? ?
temperature of daytime and nighttime periods was greater than 30 and 25 in the August and? ?
September. And this average temperature of daytime and nighttime periods was lower than 25?
and 20 in the October and November, respectively. Prevailing wind was different between?
August and September, October and November. Prevailing wind between August and September
is about SWW either daytime or nighttime periods. In the October and November, prevailing
wind was ENE in the daytime and nighttime periods. In general, average wind speed in the
October and November was greater than that of August and September. These phenomenons of
temperature, wind speed and prevailing wind were occurred by northeaster monsoon in the
October and November. Table 1 was composes which represent downward and upward dry
deposition flux with respect to total suspend particulates concentration, wind speed and
prevailing wind direction, respectively.
Besides, the total suspended particulate concentration was also measured in the traffic
sampling site. The average total suspended particulate in the daytime and nighttime period were

(800 car per hour) period and thus cause the particles resuspended to the atmosphere. About all,
the dry deposition fluxes of NO3-, SO42-, NH4+, and Ca2+ in daytime were higher than those
pollutants in nighttime period. However, dry deposition fluxes species Cl- , Na+, and Mg2+ were
almost remain unchanged in the daytime and nighttime period. Another interesting phenomenon
was observed, the sodium and chloride concentrations in total suspended particulate were
highly positive related, indicated that the sea-salt aerosols were the major contributors at the
traffic sampling site of central Taiwan.
Fig. 4 indicated the average water-soluble ionic species concentration (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-,
Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) of total suspend particulates in the daytime and nighttime period.
The average total suspended particulates concentration of the NH4+ in the daytime period was
about 2.7 times as that of nighttime period. However, the average daytime/nighttime
concentrations ratios for species K+, Na+ and Ca2+ were 0.30, 0.16 and 1.15, respectively. As for
the average total suspended particulates concentration, the results also revealed that the SO42-
concentrations during the daytime period were higher than the nighttime period. However, these
differences were not significant for species Cl- and NO3- during daytime and nighttime period. In
general, the average SO42- concentrations obtained in this study were higher than the rest of the
other sampling site in Taiwan. Taichung thermal power plant which near to the sampling site
(about 30 km) was the possible source for the high concentrations of SO42- in this study. Beyond
that, Taichung Industrial Park which nearly the sampling site is another possible SO42- source.
Fig.5 showed the average downward dry deposition velocities with respect to water-soluble
ionic species (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) at the traffic sampling site. That
results of this study revealed that the average dry deposition velocities for NO3-, K+ and Ca2+ in
the daytime period were higher than these of the nighttime period; the average downward dry
deposition velocities ratios for daytime/nighttime ionic species for NO3-, K+ and Ca2+ were 8.1,
1.81 and 3.37 respectively, the average upward dry deposition velocities ratios for daytime/
nighttime ionic for species NO3-, K+ and Ca2+ were 26.5, 3.6 and 3.1 respectively.
The average water-soluble ionic species composition (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+,
Mg2+, and Ca2+) of total suspended particulates the daytime and nighttime period at the traffic
sampling site were shown in Fig. 6 The mean water-soluble ionic species composition order for
these ionic species is SO42-> Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+> K+> NH4+> NO3- > Cl- for total suspended
particulates the daytime period while in the mean water-soluble ionic species composition order
for these ionic species is Ca2+>SO42- >Na+ > K+ > Mg2+> NO3- > NH4+> Cl- for total suspended
particulates in the nighttime period. The results also indicate that SO42-and Ca2+ have higher
average composition for total suspended particulates in the daytime period while Ca2+, SO42-, and
Na+ have the higher average composition for total suspends particulates in the nighttime period.
The average water-soluble ionic species composition (Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+, NH4+, K+,
Mg2+, and Ca2+) for downward and upward dry deposition flux during the daytime and nighttime
period at the traffic sampling site were shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). The average
daytime/nighttime period composition ratios for water-soluble ionic species Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, Na+,
NH4+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ were 0.39, 1.67, 12.35, 0.35, 4.75, 0.58, 0.38, and 0.79 for the
downward dry deposition fluxes composition, respectively. And the average daytime/nighttime
