3introduce great amount of redundancies, which
translates to significant increase in bit rates. For MDC
to be practical, it is essential to reduce the bit rates
significantly, but without sacrificing the video quality
too much.
In this paper, our research goal is to reduce the
required bit rates as much as possible with least
sacrifice to the video quality. We propose and evaluate
various weighted spatial domain sub-sampling based
MDC schemes at the encoder and the associated
pixel-level error concealment techniques at the decoder,
recommendations are then made accordingly. The
proposed algorithm features the derivation of weighted
sub-sampling schemes and their associated recovery
formulas, which yields better R-D performance for QP
smaller than 30. Based on the weighted sub-sampling
and the recovery formulas, we propose and evaluate the
complementary 2 description Coding (C2DC) as well as
C3DC and C4DC.
We conduct extensive experiments with
comparisons to other schemes to evaluate the
robustness of the proposed C2DC scheme in H.264
video transmission over error prone network.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
allows pixel-level error concealment which yields not
only the smoother concealed perceptual quality without
blocking artifacts, but also better PSNR. As a result, the
proposed algorithm is proven to be the most robust
scheme (in both perceptual and rate-distortion senses)
when suffering from various packet loss rates. For
Foreman video sequence at 512 kbps with 20% packet
loss rate, the proposed scheme still delivers average
PSNR around 30dB with good perceptual quality.
This paper is organize as follows: in section 2,
we investigate various sub-sampling schemes in the
encoder. In section 3, we derive the recovery formulas
associated with the weighted sub-sampling schemes
discussed in section 2 and derive the recovery formulas
for the complementary 2DC (C2DC) scheme. In section
4, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the
performance of the proposed sub-sampling schemes and
various recovery schemes, recommendation and
defaults are made accordingly. The complementary
3DC (C3DC) and 4DC (C4DC) are proposed and
evaluated in section 5 and 6 respectively. The C2DC,
C3DC and C4DC are then evaluated and compared in
R-D sense in section 7. In section 8, we evaluate the
proposed C2DC together with other schemes for their
performances in error free and in various error
conditions. Conclusion is made in Section 9.
II . Various Spatial Sub-sampling Schemes
In addition to direct sub-sampling as adopted in
[2], we proposed two low-pass filtered sub-sampling
schemes namely A3 and WA3 sub-sampling schemes.
The three sub-sampling schemes are discussed below
and will be evaluated later:
2.1 DIrect (DI) sub-sampling
Each frame F[m,n] (m: row index, n: column index)
the input video frame is decomposed into 4 sub-frames
(the descriptions) denoted as SF1, SF2, SF3 and SF4.
Where SF1[m,n]=F[2m,2n] also noted as DUL (Direct
sub-sampled from the Upper Left pixel in a 2x2 block
in the original). Similarly,
SF2[m,n]=F[2m,2n+1] (denoted as DUR), SF3[m,
n]=F[2m+1,2n] (denoted as DLL) and SF4[m,n]
=F[2m+1,2n+1] (DLR).
2.2 Averaging 3 pixels (A3) sub-sampling
This scheme is designed to provide low-pass
filtering to reduce the aliasing effect due to
sub-sampling. Similar to the direct sub-sampling, each
frame can be decomposed into 4 sub-frames, but each
pixel in the sub-frame is the average of 3
neighboring pixels in the triangular vertexes (see Figure
53.1 Recovery formula for A3_45 (2DC) scheme
The problem of recovery is formulated as follows:
Given two received pixel values R_a 1 and R_a 4 in
A3_45 sub-sampling scheme, find the best
approximation of pixel value of A and D in the original
2x2 block.
Given
1 43 3
A B C B C D
a and a
  
Step 1：
1 4 3
A D
a a
  , (implies that the distance
between two received complementary pixels is only
1/3 of the original distance.)
Step 2: Assuming 1 4
2 2
a aA D   (same average,
which translates to A+D=B+C), then we have
A=2a 1 - a 4 and D=2a 4 -a1 . The idea is shown in
Figure 2.
a 1 a 4
DA
3 * ( a 1 - a 4 )
Figure 2. Assumption & Relationship among A, D, a 1 ,
a 4 in A3 scheme
Since error due to coding process is irreversible,
a 1 and a 4 can only be estimated by their coded and
received (decoded) values R_a 1 and R_a 4 respectively,
the recovery formula for A and D are as follows:
A= 2R_a 1 - R_a 4 and D=2R_a 4 -R_a1 .
3.2 Recovery formula for WA3_45 2DC scheme
The recovery problem in WA3_45 scheme is
formulated the same as that in A3_45 scheme.
In WA3,
1 42 4 2 4
A B C D B C
a and a
    
Step1：

Step 2: Assuming 1 4
2 2
a aA D   (also translates
to A+D=B+C), we have
1 43
2
a a
A
 and 4 13

a a
D

Since a 1 and a 4 can only be estimated by R_a 1 and
R_a 4 respectively, the recovery formulas for A and D
for WA3 scheme are as follows:
1 43 _ _
2
R a R a
A
 and 4 13 _ _

The degree of validity of the proposed recovery
formula is proportional to the degree of validity of the
relation 1 4_ _A D R a R a   . For smooth area in
an image, the relation 1 4A D a a   is normally
hold while a 1 R_a 1 and a 4 R_a 4 are normally
hold for smaller QP.
Intensity Correction (IC) for WA3_45 scheme
The IC technique is proposed by Shen et al. [7]:
Given an input low resolution frame FLR of size
N/2xM/2, its interpolated high resolution version F HR
of size NxM can be improved in PSNR by correcting F
HR toward the ideal relationship
(2 ,2 ) (2 1,2 ) (2 ,2 1) (2 1,2 1)
( , )
4
HR HR HR HR

F x y
     
Among the three sub-sampling schemes, the
WA3_45 scheme allows the application of IC technique
for refining the quality of reconstructed frames. In
WA3_45, we have
1 4
2 4
a a A B C D   (or 1 4_ _
2 4
R a R a A B C D    )
which says that the value of a pixel
4
A B C D  in the
averaged and down-sampled version frame can be
obtained by simply averaging the received pixels from
the two complementary frames. Thus, Given initially
reconstructed frame ginit of size NxM, the IC refined gIC
is as follows:
Step1: Estimate the ideal FLR (average and
down-sampling of original frame F) by
fLR= (R_SF1+R_SF4)/2.
72 for QP 40 and 50, we observe that DI/DR and
WA3_45/DR performs about the same. We recommend
WA3_45/RF for QP 0~30 and DI/DR for QP greater
than 30 because of simplicity in computation.

4.3 Assessing Three Interpolation Schemes
Three interpolation schemes namely AN (Averaging 4
available Neighbors), Median [5] and ELA [6] are
tested for their performance in Foreman video quality.
For simplicity we adopt WA3_45/RF for all QP in the
first pass.
Table 3 PSNRs of interpolation schemes with
WA3_45/RF for Foreman
Foreman AN Median ELA
QP 0 38.6 39.2(+0.6) 39.1(+0.5)
QP 10 38.0 38.5(+0.5) 38.4(+0.4)
QP 20 36.3 36.7(+0.4) 36.5(+0.2)
QP 30 33.4 33.5(+0.1) 33.3(-0.1)
QP 40 29.6 29.6(+0.0) 29.2(-0.4)
QP 50 25.6 25.6(+0.0) 25.3(-0.3)
The Median interpolation performs the best in PSNR;
ELA performs better than AN in PSNR for QP smaller
than 20, but we do not consider ELA because it
produces annoying line segments in the smooth area.
4.5 Assessing IC in WA3_45/RF
We evaluate the performance of IC in WA3_45/RF with
AN and Median interpolation.
Tale 4. Effects of IC on WA3_45/RF
The IC gains extra quality in PSNR for both AN and
Median interpolation at cost of extra computation.
4.6 Assessing Computations in WA3_45/RF

interpolation schemes using MATLAB.

QP 40 323 237 1037 327
QP 50 306 228 1028 318
The above elapsed processing time for 100 CIF
frames Foreman in seconds including sub- sampling (1
sec), two channels H.264 encoding (ranging from 281
to 145 seconds for QP from 0 to 50), two channels
H.264 decoding and with MATLAB Recovery (3 sec),
interpolation (1, 801 and 91 for AN, Median and ELA
respectively), IC (44 sec) and read/write files (12 sec).
For original H.264 without 2DC, the processing time
includes encoding and decoding only.
Table 3 and 5 show that Median interpolation
produces the best PSNR at cost of significant increase
in computations. AN interpolation requires much less
computations at the cost of slightly lower PSNR than
Median (see Table 3&5). We adopt AN interpolation in
the 2nd pass with WA3_45/RF for QP<=30 or
WA3_45/DR for QP>30 in the first pass. The adopted
WA3_45/RF(DR)/AN scheme in the proposed
complementary 2DC requires less computations than
that required by the original H.264.
4.6 Assessing post filtering in WA3_45/RF/AN/IC
We implement the post filter proposed in [2] and
experimental results are listed in Table 6. The post filter
proposed in [2] can be considered in the proposed
scheme for QP 20~40.

VI . Complementary 4DC (C4DC) scheme
In C4DC, (SF1,SF4) by WA3_45 sub-sampling and
(SF2,SF3) by WA3_135 sub-sampling are both encoded
and transmitted. At receiver, decoded pixels R_ 1a ,
R_ 4a in (R_SF1, R_SF4) are used in the estimation of
A and D as that in C2DC; Similarly, R_ 2a and R_ 3a
in (R_SF2, R_SF3) are used to estimate pixel B and C.
Two reconstruction schemes RF+IC and DR+IC at
receiver are tested for their performance, the results
for Foreman, Akiyo and Stefan are listed in Table 8.
Table 8. Two reconstruction schemes in C4DC
(Foreman.cif )
The
for test
sequences Akiyo and Stefan shows similar trend as in
Foreman sequence.
We recommend RF for QP 0~30 and DR for QP
30~50. IC can be considered to increase PSNR at
cost of extra computations for QP =20 and below.
VII. Evaluations of C2DC, C3DC and C4DC in

and Table 10.
Figure 5. Comparison of three CMDC (Foreman)
Table 10. Comparison of Three CMDC (Foreman)
From Figure 5 and Table 10 , we observe that C2DC,
C3DC and C4DC achieve their highest PSNR of 39dB,
43.2dB and 43.8dB at bit rates of 9.22Mbps, 13.8 Mbps
and 18.5 Mbps respectively. C2DC performs the best
for bit rates smaller than around 2.5Mbps (QP>17), but
the quality is saturated for QP<10; C3DC performs the
best for bit rates greater than 2.5 Mbps (QP>17).

the 32x32 super-macro-block by applying the Bilinear
+ IC super-resolution algorithm on the correctly
received macro-block. Case 3: Both macro-blocks are
lost. In this case, the reconstruction of the
super-macro-blocks is skipped.
After all super-blocks in a full frame are
reconstructed, the skipped super macro-blocks (case 3)
are then reconstructed by standard H.264 error
concealment scheme based on the surrounding available
macro-blocks.
Figure 7. Possible macro-blocks error patterns in two
complementary sub-frames.
Let p be the packet loss rate, the probability that
case 1, case 2 and case 3 occurs are (1-p) 4 ,
4p-8p 2 +4p 3 ,2p 2 (1-p) 2 +4(1-p)p 3 +p 4 =2p 2 -p 4 resp
ectively. For p=5%, the probabilities of case 1, 2 and 3
are 81.45%, 18.05% and 0.50% respectively. For
p=10%, the probabilities of super-blocks losses for case
1,2 and 3 are 65.61%, 32.4% and 1.99% respectively.
For p=20%, the probabilities of case 1, 2 and 3 are
40.96%, 51.2% and 7.84% respectively. The case 3 is
relatively low in probability.
For case 1, the super-blocks are reconstructed with
both complementary macro-blocks, which has the best
possible quality; for case 2, the lost super-blocks are
reconstructed using Bilinear + IC, which yields
satisfactory concealed image quality in pixel-level
without causing blocky artifacts; for case 3, the
recovered super-blocks by the standard H.264 error
concealment technique [9] normally suffers from
somewhat blocky artifacts. Fortunately, the probability
of case 3 is relatively low.
8.2 Performance Evaluations in Error Conditions
In this section, we evaluate and compare the
performance of the proposed scheme with other
common seen schemes in various packet loss rates on
different types of video sequences.
8.2.1 Experimental Setup
The four schemes to be evaluated and compared
are listed below. Other experimental environments are
the same as that described in section IV.
Four error pattern and packet loss rates: 3%, 5%,
10% and 20% of packet loss rates are tested to simulate
the network conditions. The packet loss patterns are
generated according to [10] by VCEG.
8.2.2 Experiments and Performance Analysis
A. Error-Free Rate-Distortion Performance
Figure 8, 9 and 10 show the bit-rate vs. PSNR
performances of the 4 schemes for test video sequences
Foreman, Akiyo and Stefan respectively in error free
condition (i.e. Packet Loss Rate, PLR=0%).

any error-resilienct tool.

By observing the results in Figure 11~13 for the
three test sequences, we conclude that the H.264 w/o
FMO (Scheme 1) performs the best in terms of average
PSNR for PLR below 1%; Scheme 2 (FMO) performs
the best for PLR between 1%~10%; While the proposed
C2DC outperforms the other schemes in average PSNR
for PLR over 10% in error free conditions.
Even the FMO (Scheme 2) leads the proposed
C2DC scheme in average PSNR for PLR smaller than
10%; however, once packet loss occurs, the proposed
C2DC scheme performs pixel-level error concealment,
which outperforms the H.264 standard error
concealment [11] in general, not only in perceptual
quality (more smooth concealment by C2DC than the
annoying blocky artifacts by standard error
concealment), but also in the objective PSNR as shown
in Figure 14. In case of losing one packet (macro
block error pattern as shown in Figure 7.2), the results
of error concealment by the proposed C2DC (scheme 3)
is depicted in Figure 14.1(b), which outperforms that
concealed by scheme 2 as shown in Figure 14.1(a),
not only in perceptual quality, but also in PSNR (34.17
vs. 32.28dB).
In case of losing two packets (Macro block error
pattern in Figure 7.3). The results of error concealment
by proposed C2DC for case 1, 2 and 3 are shown in
Figure 14.2(a),(b) and (c) respectively. It is observed
that for case 1 and 2, the pixel-level concealed frames
by the proposed C2DC in case 1 and 2 yield very good
perceptual quality. Only in case 3, the C2DC cannot
perform pixel-level concealment, instead the standard
H.264 error concealment is performed resulting in
serious blocky artifacts similar to that by FMO.
However, our analysis in section 5.1 shows that the
probability that case 3 occurs is very low.
In case of losing three packets (macro block error
pattern in Figure 7.4), the proposed C2DC performs
Bilinear+IC to enlarge a correctly received 16x16

macro-block into a 32x32 super-macro block and
applying standard H.264 error concealment [11] to the
reconstruct the other three super macro-blocks. The
reconstructed frames by the proposed C2DC (Figure
14.3(a) is slight better than that by FMO (Figure
14.3(b)). In case of all four packets are lost, the C2DC
reconstruct the current frame by copying the previous
decoded frame.
In summary, the proposed C2DC is more robust to
packet loss than FMO in PSNR as shown in Figure 11,
12 and 13. Furthermore, it provides better perceptual
video quality due to the pixel-level error concealment
technique.
