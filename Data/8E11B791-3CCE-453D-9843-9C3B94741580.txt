英文摘要 
Ge nano-dots embedded in a SiO2 matrix were 
formed by thermal oxidation of hydrogenated 
amorphous SiGe/Si (a-SiGe:H/a-Si:H) 
multilayers and the cathodoluminescence spectra 
were employed to observe the photoemission 
and investigate the origins of  photoemission 
from Ge nano-dots/SiO2 system. An ultraviolet 
(371 nm) photoemission from Ge nano-dots/SiO2 
system was observed at room temperature and 
this luminescence was attributed to 
recombination in defects at the interface between 
the Ge nano-dots and surrounding oxide matrix. 
Besides, based on the Ge nano-dots embedded in 
SiO matrix as absorption active medium, 
ultraviolet photodetectors with 
metal-semiconductor-metal structure have been 
fabricated. The transient response and effects of 
metal electrodes on dc characteristics of 
fabricated photodetectors were investigated in 
this work. The fall-time of fabricated device 
raised as finger spacing increased, while the 3dB 
bandwidth increased as finger spacing decreased. 
The dark current of device with Cr metal 
electrode was much smaller than Ti ones. The 
device photo-to-dark current ratio with Cr 
electrode was one magnitude larger than with Ti 
electrode. 
 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
自從在鍺奈米點包埋在二氧化矽中觀察
到光致發光後[1]，鍺奈米點的光發射已經被
廣泛的研究與探討；然而，鍺奈米點的發光機
制卻已經變成一個辯論的議題，其中對應到各
種不同製作鍺奈米點的方法中，以量子侷限效
應[1-5]、晶體結構的轉移[6]、二氧化矽的缺
陷與鍺奈米點的表面效應[7-10]為較可信任
的機制。在本篇報告中，我們利用電致發光頻
譜儀來觀察與探討鍺奈米點包埋在二氧化矽

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Figure 2 illustrates the CL spectra of the 6-periods a-
Si0.91Ge0.09:H/a-Si:H multilayer thermally oxidized at 900 
℃ for various durations of 90, 120 and 150 min., 
respectively. The CL spectra were measured at room 
temperature in the wavelength range of 200-800 nm with a 
monochromator resolution of 0.3 nm. The CL spectra have 
the same line shape and present an UV band peaking 
approximately at 391 nm (3.17 eV) with a full-width at 
half-maximum (FWHM) of 60 nm (0.048 eV). This narrow 
bandwidth makes it very sensitive to specific band around 
the wavelength of 391 nm. In order to confirm the origin of 
CL peaks illustrated in Figure 2, the CL spectra of Si wafer 
with the top as-deposited a-Si0.91Ge09:H/a-Si:H multilayer 
or with the thermally grown oxide only were measured at 
the same conditions, and no photoemission was observed. 
So, we could infer that the prominent CL signals are 
strongly correlated to the presence of Ge nanocrystals.  
Since the first observation of photoluminescence from Ge 
nanocrystals embedded in SiO2 matrix [14], relevant light 
emissions due to Ge nanocrystals have been extensively 
studied. If the interface traps between Ge nanocrystals and 
SiO2 are possible sources of luminescence, the CL intensity 
would increase with increasing Ge nanocrystass total 
surface area. In our work, the total surface area per volume 
of Ge nanocrystals formed by 120 min. oxidation (density 
of 1.91 x 1011 cm-2) is 1.3 times that of Ge nanocrystals 
formed by 150 min. oxidation (density of 1.5 x 1011 cm-2); 
therefore, the interface traps of Ge nanocrystals/SiO2 are 
possible origin of the increased CL intensity. In addition, 
since the as-deposited a-Si0.91Ge09:H/a-Si:H multilayer is 
oxidized at high temperature of 900  with durations of 90, ℃
120, 150 min., the SiO, GeO or Si-Ge-O compounds may 
formed also. Generally, we could assume that the UV 
luminescence is generated by recombination in defects 
located at the interface between the Ge nanocrystals and/or 
SiO, GeO, Si-Ge-O dielectric medium [10, 11]. 
Figure 3 illustrates the SEM micro-graph of the 6 periods 
of a-Si0.91Ge0.09:H/a-Si:H multilayer thermally oxidized at 
900  for 120 min.. It could be clearly observed that the ℃
formed Ge nanocrystals had been well separated to each 
other. The sizes of formed Ge nanocrystals were ranging 
from 20 to 40 nm and the density of formed Ge 
nanocrystals was about 1.91 x 1011 cm-2.  
Figure 4 illustrates the SEM micro-graph of a fabricated 
MSM UV detector with finger-electrodes and pads. The 
active area, finger-electrode spacing and width are about 
115 x 80 μm2, 6.5 μm and 2 μm, respectively. 
   Figure 5 illustrates the photo-currents and dark-currents 
of the fabricated MSM UV detectors measured at room 
temperature with various finger and space widths. The 
responsivity, photo-current, and dark-current of the 
fabricated device with 2 μm finger width and 6 μm finger 
spacing were 0.0086 (A/W), 125 μA, and 4.78 nA, 
respectively, and the device photo-to-dark current ratio 
(Ip/Id) could reach 2.6 x 104, under a 25 V bias voltage and 
0.404 μm incident laser light power of 15 mW. The device 
photo-current increased and dark-current decreased, which 
lead to an increased Ip/Id ratio, as finger spacing increased. 
The fewer the finger-electrodes indicated the larger the 
active area resulted in the higher device photo-current. The 
more the finger-electrodes indicated the narrower the finger 
spacing for the same active area led to a higher device 
internal electric-field and hence induce the higher device 
dark-current.  
In addition, the transient responses of the fabricated 
MSM UV detectors were measured also. The 3-dB 
bandwidths of the fabricated devices being biased at 20 V 
with the same finger width of 2 μm and different finger 
spacing of 3, 4, 5 and 6 μm were estimated to be 262.5, 
248.23, 234.9 and 221.52 Hz, respectively, as measured 
with the periodic light pulses from 0.404 μm laser light 
chopped with a chopper. The fabricated device with 3 μm 
finger spacing had the lowest transient fall-time due to the 
larger electric-field in device would result in a higher drift 
velocity of carriers. Since the formed Ge nanocrystals were 
embedded in a SiO2 matrix, the carrier transport might be 
dominated by the field-enhanced tunneling. Therefore, the 
device 3-dB bandwidth was low because of the large native 
energy barrier of SiO2. 
 
4 CONCLUSION 
 
The MSM UV detectors with Ge nanocrystals as active 
medium embedded in SiO2 matrix had been fabricated on Si 
substrate. The direct-current and transient characteristics of 
the fabricated MSM UV detectors have been investigated, 
also. The accomplishment of MSM UV detector based-on 
group Ⅳ nanocrystals leads to employ the indirect-gap 
semiconductors as new materials for future optoelectronic 
applications.
