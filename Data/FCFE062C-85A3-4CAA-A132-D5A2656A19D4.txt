三、報告內容  
(The following manuscript is under review by the Journal) 
1. Introduction 
An improvement in medical care and surgery has made the replacement of bones 
and joints more common. The removal of over-grown cysts and malignant tumors in 
bone leaves defects or cavities. The sizes of these defects may be as large as several 
centimeters, making them irreparable by normal bone cells. Thus, implants of 
synthetic, natural, or composite materials are necessary.1 Polymethylmethacrylate 
(PMMA) cement has been used widely in various prosthetic replacement operations. 
However, PMMA cement has several inherent problems, such as its 
non-bone-bonding character and the large amount of heat generated during its 
polymerization. Histological results show that with PMMA cement, an intervening 
soft tissue layer is always observed in vivo at the cement-bone interface.2 
Due to its superior biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, calcium phosphate 
cement (CPC) has been proposed as a filling material in dental and orthopedic 
applications.3-9 One major advantage of CPC is its ability to be easily shaped as a 
paste during an operation or to be injected into a cavity with a syringe without 
requiring invasive access through the tissues. Although CPC can be prepared using 
different methods or from different precursor calcium phosphate compounds,10-12 the 
most popular CPC is based on the reaction of tetracalcium phosphate (TTCP) powder 
with an equimolar ratio amount of either anhydrous or dihydrous dicalcium phosphate 
powder (DCPA or DCPD, respectively). The resulting mixture is known as 
conventional CPC (c-CPC).13-15 Mixing unmodified TTCP and DCPA powders in a 
dilute phosphate-containing only solution leads to the formation of hydroxyapatite 
(HA), which prevents a long setting time of (30-60) min in SBF.16 A typical example 
is the commercialized bone cement made of BoneSource® powder (TTCP/DCPA) 
(Stryker Osteosynthesis, Freiburg, Germany) with a 0.25 M hardening solution of 
sodium phosphate solution. It is unknown exactly how the BoneSource® bone cement 
properties could be improved or how it could become the generally termed 
“anti-washout” or “non-dispersive” in simulate body fluids (SBF).17 Another approach 
to shortening the setting time of CPC is the mixture of additives into original calcium 
phosphate powders. Actually, many studies do the excellent works to largely improve 
the properties of setting time and strengths and make the CPCs anti-washout or 
non-dispersive in SBF.18,19 A fast-setting CPCs was achieved by using phosphate 
solution as the cement liquid20 and anti-washout CPCs were prepared by adding 
gelling agents such as hdroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), chitosan lactate etc. in 
the cement liquid.21  Subsequently Xu et al. developed CPC composites that were 
0.01 mL from 0.11 to 0.24 mL per specimen (0.8 g powder) and the P/L ratios were 
from 7.3 to 3.3 g/ mL, respectively. For compressive strength (CS) testing, a mold 
was used with an opening that was 6 x 12 mm (diameter x depth) (ASTM F 451-99a). 
One minute after mixing, the cement paste was uniformly packed in a stainless steel 
mold under a pressure of 0.7 MPa. After being in the mold for 14 min (15 min after 
mixing), the nd-CPC sample was removed from the mold and immersed for 24 h in 
Hanks' physiological solution (1 g bone cement/ 10 mL SBF) at 37 ℃, as suggested 
by a previous study.33 The compressive strength (n = 10) was measured using a 
table-top mechanical tester (Shimadzu AGS-500D, Tokyo, Japan) at a crosshead 
speed of 1.0 mm/ min. 
2.3. Morphology observation 
 To study the morphological changes of CPC at different times during the reaction, 
the powder surface (nd-CPC) of the samples was examined. A drop of the dispersion 
in ethanol, created by supersonication, was dripped onto a single-sided carbon sieve 
(#325 mesh) with a diameter of 3 mm, and was then left to dry to obtain a specimen 
coated with a thin carbon film. Thin foils for the study were prepared by sectioning 
the early set c-CPC specimens, which had been allowed to react for 40 min after 
mixing. The specimen was then quickly submerged in 99.5 wt% ethanol, vacuum 
filtered, and dried at 60 ℃ to stop the reactions. The specimen was mechanically 
polished to a thickness of approximately 100 µm, further dimple-thinned to a central 
thickness of approximately 50 µm, and then ion-milled until perforation. Finally, the 
perforated specimen was coated with a thin carbon film for electrical conductivity. A 
JEOL JEM-3010 scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with 
an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system was used for the study. 
2.4. X-ray diffraction  
To specify the phase transformation at different times during the reaction, the 
mixing pastes of CPC were quickly submerged in a large amount of 99.5 wt% ethanol, 
ground up, vacuum filtered, and dried at 60 ℃ to immediately stop the reactions. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on CPC samples that had been immersed for 
different times using Ni-filtered CuKα radiation and an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku 
D-max IIIV, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 30 kV, 20 mA, and a scanning speed of 1 o/ 
min. 
2.5. Measurement of pH values  
The variation in pH of the CPC samples (P/L ratio, 3.5 g/ mL) was evaluated 
during the setting process using a pH meter (HM-20S, Tokyo TOA Electronics Ltd, 
Tokyo, Japan) (n = 5), which was submerged in the cement paste immediately after 
(Fig. 2). The phases and microchemical analysis of particles and whiskers were 
identified by selected area diffraction (SAD) with an electron beam aperture of 0.4 
μm and EDS analysis, respectively. The results are marked on Figs. 2c and d. 
3.3. XRD and pH values of c-CPC and nd-CPC over time during early setting  
 In the XRD patterns observed during the early setting stage, the apatite phase of 
c-CPC powders mixed with hardening solution cannot be clearly observed, as shown 
in Fig. 3. The nd-CPC apatite diffraction peak (2θ = 25.9 (002)) had a recognizable 
intensity in the patterns as compared with c-CPC during the early setting reactions 
10-40 min. 
 Figure 4 shows the pH values of CPC at the early setting stage and a slower 
increase in the nd-CPC pH values as compared to that of c-CPC is shown. After 20 
min of c-CPC reaction, the pH value reached a plateau of 7.8-8.0, while after 25 min, 
nd-CPC reached a plateau of 7.0-7.2.  
3.4. Dispersive testing in aqueous solution 
 In the injection test, c-CPC specimens without crystallites on the particle 
surfaces tended to disperse into the solution more quickly and easily than nd-CPC 
specimens. Air bubbles appeared in the injection test of c-CPC but not for nd-CPC, 
and the paste shapes were also different. 
4. Discussion 
4.1. Discussion of properties 
4.1.1. Compressive strength 
The literature reports an optimum P/L ratio (4.0 g/ mL) of c-CPC with a dilute 
phosphate concentration of 25 mM to form a paste,29 but that of nd-CPC has not yet 
been reported. If unsuitable P/L ratios are applied during the hardening process, they 
can result in the dispersion of specimens when immersed in a simulated body fluid. 
Since the maximum compressive strength of human trabecular bone is 30 MPa, 
implants must have a mechanical strength greater than 30 MPa if such restoration is 
trying to be applied in load-bearing conditions.34 Based on the results of this study, 
nd-CPC can therefore qualify as a restorative material in bone fillers. The initial ratio 
of hardening liquid to powder can affect the mechanical, chemical, and 
microstructural properties for wettability and porosity of specimens, as described in 
the literature.14-24 The hardening process needed to give a specimen mechanical 
strength involves the diffusion of ions between particles. The literature by Xu and 
Simon Jr24 showed that powder-to-liquid ratios had a very strong connection with the 
strength. When the P/L ratio was 4.0, the pastes were dry and at 4.5, the paste were 
within the first 5 min of the c-CPC reaction, and it was the fastest dissolving rate 
during the initial setting stage. The slower increase in the pH value accompanied by 
rapid apatite phase formation may be explained by the reaction state of ionic diffusion 
rather than the dissolution that was occurring in the initial nd-CPC reaction process. It 
is interesting to observe in the injection test that nanocrystallites on the ceramic 
surfaces of nd-CPC dramatically reduced the dispersivity of the paste in solution. The 
appearance of air bubbles in the injection test indicates that the structures of the pastes 
were too loose to interlock the particles. Comparing with the Xu et al. study,22 the 
bone cements were composed of CPC-HPMC-mannitol, CPC-chitosan-mannitol and 
CPC-chitosan-mannitol-fiber mixing with the setting solutions of sodium 
phosphate/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or chitosan lactate aqueous solutions and 
had the ability to anti-washout. The anti-washout CPC showed the same 
non-dispersive ability on immersed immediately in a SBF solution after mixing. The 
reason of anti-washout CPC could be non-collapse in solution was the particles that 
had been interlocked efficiently by the organic additives. 
4.2. Fast setting mechanisms 
In the literature, TTCP is generally thought to be structurally similar to apatite 
and to act as a preferred nucleating template.35 The TTCP hydrolysis is thought to 
release OH-, thereby neutralizing the reaction in acidic solution. The reaction may be 
described as follows:  
5Ca4(PO4)2O + 2PO43- + 5H2O → 4Ca2+ + 12PO43- + 10OH- 
After the neutralization is complete, the OH- concentration cannot be neutralized 
by H+ in solution. The calcium and phosphate ion concentrations are supersaturated, 
and in the following reaction, which occurs in a neutral to basic environment, an 
apatite phase is preferentially nucleated. This is described by the following reaction: 
4Ca2+ + 12PO43- + 4OH- → 4Ca5(PO4)3OH 
Between the dissolution/hydrolysis and neutralization reactions, the pH value 
rises from 1.96 in the hardening solution to 7.9-8.0 in an equilibrium paste within 
approximately 10 min (Fig. 4). The DCPD and DCPA are the least soluble phases 
when the pH falls below 4.2 in the phase diagram of the ternary system, 
Ca(OH)2-H3PO4-H2O.3,16 However, the time of reaction at pH values below 4.2 is 
very short (< 30 s), thus the cement only reacts in acidic solution for a short period of 
time. During the short period of the acidic transition process of the early reaction, the 
lowest energy for nucleation should occur at the homogeneous site,36 DCPA of CPC. 
In the acidic reaction, the precipitate phase becomes: 
Ca2+ + PO43- + H+ + 2H2O→ CaHPO4 (2H2O)
