熱源之臆測與預估－最小均方根誤差法與馬可夫-灰色模型之應用
Estimating and Forecasting the Strength of Heat Source about
Heat Conduction Problem by the Least-Squares Error Method
and Markov Chains-Grey Model
Abstract
This study is intended to provide an inverse method combined with
Markov Chains-Grey model for estimating and forecasting the heat generation
rate in a heat source device. Finite-difference methods are first employed to
discrete the problem domain and then a linear inverse model is constructed to
identify the heat generation rate condition. The present approach is to rearrange
the matrix form of differential governing equation and estimated coefficients of
unknown condition. Then, the linear least-squares error method is adopted to
find the solution. The results show that only one measuring point is sufficient
to estimate the heat generation rate when the measurement errors are neglected.
When the measurement errors are considered, more measuring points are
needed in order to increase the congruence of the estimated results to exact
solutions. Using the estimating value to forecasted the further data of heat
source by Markov Chains-Grey model.
The advantage of applying this method in inverse analysis is that no prior
information is needed on the functional form of the unknown quantities, and
initial guess and iteration are not required. The Markov Chains-Grey model
uses the operations of accumulated generation to build differential equations.
The Markov Chains-Grey modeling emphasis just needs using very little
history data (about 4 sample data) to build the grey prediction model, and then
we can use this model to forecast the other further unknown output data, then
to predict or to control generating equipment reliability, the device failure
be known (Fushinobu et al., 1996). Thus it is necessary to understand the heat
transfer processes not only in the vicinity of the devices, but also in the
structures to which the devices are attached. This heat transfer problem in
electronic equipment can be modeled as an array of heat generating
components (heaters) mounted on a nonheating substrate and exposed to a
moving cooling fluid. The heat generated in the components can be directly
dissipated from their exposed surface by convection or indirectly first through
the board by conduction and then by convection to the air stream. Significant
progress in the thermal issues of electronic equipment has been made so far. In
many studies the problem of electronic component cooling have been
considered (Fushinobu et al., 1996; Wroblewski and Joshi,1993; Zabib and Wo,
1989; Nagasaki et al., 1992; Choi et al., 1989; Cooley and Rajani, 1991; Hadim
and Nagurn, 1992: Rastogi and Poulikakos, 1993). Most of the work dealt with
the direct heat transfer problem, in which the heat flux or temperature histories
at the surface of a solid are known as a function of time, then the temperature
distribution can be found. However, the heat flux or temperature of electronic
components is very high, or in other special situation, direct measurements of
surface conditions are not possible. Therefore, the heat flux or temperature of
an electronic component must be determined from transient temperature
measurements at one or more interior locations of the substrate; this is an
inverse problem.
The inverse source problem is the determination of the strength of the
heat source from the temperature measured at a different point other than the
source locations. It is practical in much design and manufacturing areas in
which the strength of the heat source is undetermined. Common problems
include the detection of the quantity of the energy generation in a computer
chip, or in a microwave heating process, or in a chemical reaction process, and
the temperature or heat flux at the tool-work interface of machine cutting.
Various methods, including analytical or numerical approaches, have been
board needs to be cooled to avoid undesirable overheating. Such cooling is
performed by forced convection of air. The convective heat transfer coefficient
is denoted by h and the air temperature by T. The board is very thin as
compared to its surface dimensions ( << L ) such that the heat conduction
phenmenon in the board can be assumed to be two-dimensional (i.e.,
temperature variations across the thickness of the board can be neglected).
Further, the edges of the board can be modeled as adiabatic. A dimensionless
mathematical formulation of the problem is presented as:

By using the recursive form, a matrix equation can be expressed as

where the matrix A is a function of thermal properties, and the scale of the
position and time. The components of T are the temperatures in discretized
points, and the components of  are functions of the boundary, initial

T exact in Eq. (14) is the exact temperature. T measurement is the measured
temperature at the grid points. The measurement errors are caused by the
interpolation of the measuring instruments, uncertainty due to calibration, and
fluctuation in sensor reading during measurement.
In the inverse problem, the accuracy of the estimation of unknowns from
the knowledge of the temperature at measurement points depends strongly on
the accuracy of the measurements. As will be seen in the examples, the
estimated solutions without measurement error ( = 0) converge to the
solutions solved by the finite-difference method for all examples. Furthermore,
the solutions are unique through the proposed verifying method. Detailed
descriptions for the problem are presented as follows:
Example:
The unknown heat generation rate Q() is expressed in the following
form:
5.0)5sin(
2
1
)(Q  0.0 0.5
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the estimation quality of Q() in this
example. Without measurement errors and the measurement position located at
X=0.25, Y=0.25 for from 0.00 to 0.5 with a 0.025 increment, the inverse
values from the present study are in excellent agreement with the direct
solutions. Figure 2 also illustrates the numerical results for the estimation
quality of Q() for = 0.5% and 1% with one measurement point (located at
X=0.25, Y=0.5). It is found that the oscillation of Q() response becomes
more severe as the measurement error increases. The discrepancies between

00.050.025.025.0
The maximum value of Pij is 0.75, the corresponding state is S2,
Obtaining predicted future value (=0.5025) is x(k)+0.5( ijij BA  )= 0.5
(0.93195+0.96195) = 0.94695. Comparison of the forecasted heat generation
rate Q(0.5025), the result shows that the case of using MCGM(1,1) forecasted
value more better than the case using GM(1,1)forecasted value
(Q(0.5025)=1.09). The discrepancies between forecasted value and exact
value (Qexact()=0.96195) are 3.1% and 13.31% for the cases of using
MCGM(1,1) and GM(1,1) method, respectively.
Figure 5 shows a comparison of the estimated heat generation rate for 
= 0. 5% for three cases (with measurement positions located at X=0.25,
Y=0.25 and X=0.25, Y=0.5; or at X=0.25, Y=0.75 and X=0.5, Y=0.75; or at
X=0.25, Y=0.75 and X=0.5, Y=0.75 and X=0.75, Y=0.75). The result shows
that the case of using three sensors (located at X=0.25, Y=0.75; X=0.5,
Y=0.75; X=0.75, Y=0.75) has the best estimated value among the three cases.
In this case, the number of sensors is more than that of the other cases,
resulting in a better estimated value. From Figs. 5, it is found that the
estimation of the heat generation rate distribution becomes more stable for a
given set of measured temperature data as the number of measurement points
increases. For = 0.5%, the maximum discrepancies in the heat generation
rate at the board are 11.1 % and 8.9% for the cases of using one and two
sensors, respectively.
Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the estimated and forecasted heat sorce
Q() for measurement errors of = 0.5% with two measurement points (the
sensors located at (X=0.25, Y=0.75) & (X=0.5, Y=0.75)). In Fig. 6, the DGM
(1,1) forecasting values which mainly uses four estimated data (0.505, 0.69,
(Qexact()=0.96195) are 5.7% and 14.35% for the cases of using MCGM(1,1)
and GM(1,1) method, respectively.
The advantage of applying MCGM(1,1) and GM(1,1) methods in inverse
analysis is that we can forecast the other further unknown output data, then to
predict or to control generating equipment reliability, the device failure occurs
can be avoid.
In the example, by using one measurement points (N=1), and excluding
measurement errors, the estimated values provide a very good approximation
regardless of the measurement positions. When considering the measurement
errors, the magnitude of the discrepancies in the heat generation rate is directly
proportional to the size of measurement error. Thus, a larger measurement error
requires more measurement points to increase the accuracy of the estimates.
One shortcoming of this method is needed to solve a system of
simultaneous equations. Also, the inverse matrix R [Eq. (13)] may become ill
conditioned for temperature responses larger measurement error. The
estimated value is very sensitive to any error in the temperature measurement
and may even become unstable. The sensitivity depends on the type of
problem being solved (i.e., the governing equation and its boundary
conditions), the position where the temperature is measured, the measurement
error and the number of sensors. The present results confirm that the inverse
values are extremely sensitive to measurement error, sensor location and
number of sensors, as mentioned by Beck et al. (1985) and Hensel (1991).
Conclusion
A successful inverse solution for estimating the heat generation rate in
an electronic device has been developed. A direct inverse formulation is
constructed by using the reverse matrix, which is derived from the governing
equation, initial and boundary conditions. Three examples have been used to
