1.Introduction
The conventional approach for describing
quantum mechanics is via Schrödinger’sequation,
but an alterative equivalent formalism is quantum
diffusive fluid dynamics (QDFD)[1-4]. In these
representations, quantum mechanics is described in
terms of a density and a velocity field which jointly
obey the usual mass and momentum conservation
equation of hydrodynamics for a compressible fluid
with a particular constitutive law.
The QDFD formulation requires solving a set
of nonlinear partial differential equations. Classical
fluid dynamics can be described in terms of the
equivalent Eulerian and Lagragian representations.
The singularities in the quantum potential often
cause the propagation in time to become unstable
no matter which frame of reference or regridding
technique is used. These instabilities are most
severe for problems involving the scattering of a
wave packet from a repulsive barrier such as an
Eckart barrier. The reflection of the wave packet
off the barrier produces interference effects which
result in “ripples”and “nodes”in the reflected part
of the wave packet. The quantum potential and
force become large near the nodes and eventually
errors accumulate and the propagation becomes
unstable. An accurate treatment of these
interference effects is necessary in order to describe
many important processed in chemical reaction
dynamics, such as, resonance phenomenon, and
interference effects between the reactive and
nonreactive contribution to the cross sections for
reactions which involve several identical nuclei.
Inelastic scattering processes also require an
accurate treatment of the reflected wave packet [9].
To make a comprehensive survey of this study
[6-23], there are several questions: 1. the stability
under the wave propagation pass the external
potential energy. 2 the numerical divergence happen
when the probability density value approach to zero.
3. it’s hard to high dimension especial under
external potential energy. One of them can be
solved, but other problems is not be satisfied.
This paper implements the QDFD formalism
within the Eularian representation. The finite
volume method of upwind technique is used to
derive an algorithm for quantum diffusive fluid
dynamical mechanics.
2. Quantum Diffusive Fluid Dynamic Mechanics
2.1 QDFD Formulation
The quantum diffusive fluid dynamical
formulation of the Schrödinger equation is obtained
by expressing the Schrödinger wave function as
    1/ 2, exp ,r t iS r t   where  and S are
real. Let  ,u v S u Substituting this into the
time-dependent Schrödinger equation and
separating out the real and imaginary parts, the
quantum fluid dynamical formulation is written as

(r)V is the external potential energy surface, m is
the mass, M is dilatational energy and  is
quantum kinetic energy. With the exception of the
quantum potential these equations are similar to
what is found in the classical theory of fluid
dynamics. Thus the same and similar numerical
methods may be employed as used in classical
computational fluid dynamics.
2.2 Numerical Methods
The computation procedure starts by
discretizing the domain of interest into
quadrilaterals labeled as K ij . The subscripts i
and j label the direction. Flow variables are then
computed at the barycenter of each quadrilateral.
The solutions at the boundaries of the quadrilaterals
are matched up imposing the flow conservation of
convective terms across the boundaries. A
third-order upwind finite-volume method is used
for the convection terms and the central finite
difference method is used for the quantum potential
terms. Then in each quadrilateral, ijK , Eq. (2.1)
and Eq.(2.2) can be written as
 1 ,

3 Applications
3.1 One-Dimensional Particle Motion without
External Potential
After spatial discretization Eqs. (2.1) and
(2.2) becomes a set of differential equations in time
and can be numerically. In this section two
numerical simulations were studied and compared
to test their accuracy. To examine the accuracy of
each simulation, a one dimensional free particle
Gaussian wave packet of the form (at t = 0),
 x,0 2.0 e
xx0 2 eik xx0  (3.1)
was used.
The initial states and parameters for the free
particle are listed in Table 1. To validate the
capability of the free particle motion with a
Gaussian wave packet and the resolution of the
scheme described in previous section, we use the
QFD formulation to one dimensional free particle
motion. A uniform grid in the resolution of 6000 on
the computation of –100 < x < 100. Fig. 1 shows
the computed results of the density distribution
along the x-axis in comparison with the
Schrödinger equation solutions at t = .05, 48.4, 73.6,
96.8, 121, 145.2 (fs). It is found that the present
solutions agree well with the Schrödinger equation
solutions.
3.2 One-Dimensional Particle Motion with
External Potential
In the section, we will consider the
scattering of a one-dimensional Gaussian wave
packet from a repulsive Eckart barrier and downhill
ramp barrier.
The Eckart potential (see Fig. 2) is given by
   20 0P bV x V V x V sech a x x      (3.2)
The other external potential is downhill ramp
potential (see Fig. 2). It is given by
V xV0 1

(3.3)
where Vo is the barrier height, a = 0.4
determines the width, and xb is the location of the
barrier maximum. The mass used in the
calculations is 2000m a.u.
The initial Gaussian wave packet at t = 0 is given
by

center of the wave packet, and k determines the
initial phase  0 0S k x x  and flow kinetic
energy  2 2 2E k m . The initial conditions for
the velocity are give by  0 01u m S x k m   .

Figure 11 and 12 show the boundary conditions and
the probability density distribution at x = 0.0.
The computational results of the quantum fluid
dynamic formulation are presented. From the
above discussions, the results for N = 10 and 100
are presented here to show the accuracy of the
scheme. The computational domain is chosen as [0,
30]*[0,30]. Figure 13 we plot a series of the
counter of the probability density for different
values of N. Figure 14 shows the counter
probability density for N=10, 50, 100. The
counter results are small differences between the
analytical and numerical methods. These
differences arise simply because boundary
conditions on their probability density distributions
are not quite the same. In analytical approach we
set a step function for probability density
distribution at x = 0, and in QDFD simulation we
set a gaussian distribution (see Fig.12). This led to
the velocity in the y-direction being smaller near
the exit jet as well as a smaller branching angle for
QDFD simulation.
4 Results and discussion
The probability of finding a particle
somewhere in a given region must be unity
irrespective of time. This condition implies the
proper normalization of the wave packet at all times.
Quantum hydrodynamic solutions must ultimately
satisfy the Schrödinger equation and thus must also
be properly normalized. A difficulty arises in that
solutions to the (quantum) hydrodynamics
equations are not analytic but numerical. Thus an
exact normalized solution is out of the question.
The best one can expect is a convergent solution of
some kind. Limitations on the accuracy of
numerical solutions are inherent in any calculation
by the accuracy of the machine, error build up by
propagation through multiple iterations—truncation
and round off, and the accuracy of the numerical
method itself. Nevertheless, if the initial wave
packet is normalized properly, periodic checks
tracking the normalization as time evolves is a good
indicator of the accuracy of the calculation. Fig.
B.8 plots the normalization of the wave packet for
E = 0.8 eV. A grid spacing of x = 0.03 a0 was
used. The normalization of the wave packet at
each time step is computed via Norm =

Another interesting feature of the quantum
flow fields in the presence of the singularities at the
location of vanishing wave function or density
probability density, is the divergence of both
dilatation and diffusion kinetic energy, which
resembles the expansion of the fluid to the state of
vacuum in the classical fluid flow. In the study,
the effect of singularity is considered. Fig. 9 and
Fig. 10 show results of the minimum probability
density is given in the numerical simulation. The
quantum potential change of Fig. 9b1 is greater than
Fig. 9a1, because the minimum density Fig. 9b1 is
smaller than Fig. 9a1. However, the variation in the
affect of the quantum force is very small. Figure
10 shows the counter of probability density of
two-dimensional free particle motion with downhill
ramp potential. It shows that the small minimum
probability density is relatively smooth.
