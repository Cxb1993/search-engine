Abstract 
This project developed a decision support models for resource planning in TFT-LCD industry. 
We employ stochastic and deterministic optimization, and dynamic simulation to realize the 
proposed model. Three related topics are investigated. First, an efficient order fulfillment and 
resource allocation model under a distributed agent-based production scheme is developed by 
using deterministic and stochastic optimization and solved by a genetic algorithm. The model 
minimizes total cost with an assignment of inventory and procurement plans. Secondly, the 
performance of resource planning is evaluated from a dynamic viewpoint. A business 
simulation model is established to examine the impact of capital/capacity investment of 
resources on the revenue/profit of a TFT-LCD manufacturing firm. Thirdly, a model is 
developed to examine the impact of the proposed decision support model as well as to explore 
the business knowledge in capacity-related capital-investment decisions. The project ourcome 
can contribute to the TFT-LCD related industries for their long-term productivity.  
We have completed eight tasks related to resource allocation decision models and their 
corresponding solution methods. 
1. A detailed research framework and development guidelines of the project 
2. A deterministic model for resource portfolio model for multiple resources 
3. A stochastic optimization decision model for tool procurement under demand risk 
4. Complexity analysis of the addressed problem and solution method developed 
5. A negotiation-based resource portfolio model 
6. A capacity planning and revenue/profit simulation model 
7. Examine the impact of the proposed decision support model

客戶需求，是此產業追求的目標，亦為本研究動機之二。本研究針對以上的情勢，完成
兩項研究主題：  
 產能與訂單之生產搭配決策 
 TFT-LCD 製造廠商之多製程限制下最適生產控制決策模式 
研究動機之三 
前述對投資與資源預先規劃決策，仍需賴事後之績效評估，並將此昂貴之技術產能
配置智慧予以有效累積以備後用。此外，TFT-LCD 廠商設備與技術的本土化是未來趨
勢。由於國內產品技術自主性及創新不足，專利多掌握在日本大廠，隨著面板尺寸增加，
廠商亟需克服專利權的門檻，提升技術及創新能力，爭加競爭力。目前國內主要
TFT-LCD 製造廠商技術導入技術形態包括：合資建廠、生產技術、設計技術、整
廠技術、量產技術等。隨著日本大廠逐漸釋出大量代工，並朝向更高階領域研發，我國
最具關鍵性的中游廠商也必須加快腳步，開始著手研發活動，但是此種高科技設備與技
術之研發活動的支出非常龐大，如果資金運用不當，很容易造成數億元的虧損。 
因此，持續觀察 TFT-LCD 產業實際於多製程產能配置方式，並歸納出 TFT-LCD 產
業產能配置與營業績效之成長關係，將此企業經驗予以有效的累積，以達到企業永續經
營的目標，十分重要，亦為本研究動機之三。本研究針對以上的情勢，完成兩項研究主
題： 
 多製程產能配置與營業績效之關係(企業智慧)研究 
 多製程產能配置與營業績效之 What-If 模擬分析 
根據建構出之 TFT-LCD 面板產業產能配置最佳化實務模型，一則與理想模型比較
與修正，一則賦予台灣的面板產業投資時提供一個較佳的參考。

三、結果與討論 
本研究計畫已按申請之計畫書所述，完成資源配置決策模型建立與求解程序，敘述
如下： 
1. 發展以智慧型代理人技術為基礎之具體研究架構  
2. 發展主生產企劃面與之確定性與隨機性需求狀態下多製程產能配置最佳化數
學模型 
3. 評估問題複雜度與發展近似求解方法 
4. 發展生產控制面協商式資源配置模型 
5. 發展產能規劃與營業績效之系統動態模擬模型 
6. 萃取最適產能配置決策之企業知識 
7. TFT-LCD 產業設備/技術投入與營業績效關係之實證研究 
8. 學術發表 
(1) 智慧型代理人架構之設計  
本案採用之智慧型代理人架構，依功能性分為主生產企劃之 TFT-LCD 多製程產能
配置決策智慧型代理人、生產控制之多階資源配置協調決策智慧型代理人與營業預測與
知識獲取智慧型代理人。單一代理人內部結構將分為「溝通機制」及「思考評判機制」
兩部分。 
本研究所建立之智慧型代理人決策系統因具備分散式系統優點，代理人可動態生成
與重組，以執行產品模組/製程技術/產能平衡配置之最適化決策。其具有比中央集權決
策系統更高的重用性與重組彈性。本計畫之研究成果，於系統設計時，可針對單一代理
人機能進行設計以降低系統設計的複雜度，減少研發時間，達到低成本、快速成形之目
的。

產品模組/製程技術產能配置目標 
由於市場價格不確定，本研究之產品模組/製程技術產能配置目的，以企業營運成本
為主軸，並同時考量各製程之產能平衡與客戶達交率之總合。此外，本研究之不確定模
型中，將風險性造成之產能配置損失列入成本，俾使投資決策者得以於配置方案死風險
之間進行取捨。 
多製程技術能力展開限制式 
規劃多製程技術配置考量了各製程間之技術限制、產品模組之技術需求與前置時間
展開，並使製程產能/產品模組技術需求之間達成平衡。 
技術能力與技術需求落差對決策影響之限制式 
製程能力過剩時，技術利用率過低將導致存貨增加及機會成本損失。反之，製程產
能不足，將造成客戶流失、服務率下降、運輸頻繁等額外成本。 
有限製程技術產能限制式 
製程技術/模組需求之產能配置為成本最小化。在有限產能下，同時考量產能配置帶
來之客戶達交率與風險評估以進行生產決策。 
技術需求之產品模組與製程能力限制式 
規劃期間內，產品模組對於技術之需求與製程技術能力之限制，皆一併考量於產能
配置決策中。 
(4) 生產企劃之產品模組/產能配置規劃之求解 
精確的求解方式於此技術產能/產品模組配置規劃隨機最佳化模型問題中需要大量
計算時間。本案透過運用柔性計算方法(基因演算法)有效求解此一最適化問題。 
14 
 
至已承諾之訂單中。由於 TFT-LCD 廠內具有不同技術能力與製程差異，所生產之產品
與生產速度不盡相同，不同製程技術搭配，操作成本也有所差異。本研究提出之 TFT-LCD
廠最佳多製程產能配置協調模型，可於短暫規劃時間內，找出最適多製程協調生產方
案，並計算出最適關鍵性產能生產效率與缺貨關係，以提升廠內產能生產效益並使營業
成本最小化。 
本研究並依據下列特性建構一確定性數學規劃模型。 
1. 產能配置與多階製程組合規劃中，所生產之各類產品模組之單位邊際成本。 
2. 多製程技術需求/產品模組生產所需技術之配合。 
3. 各類製程產能之理論利用率與理論輸出率。 
4. 生產已承諾訂單之缺貨成本。 
5. 各產能技術使用之生產成本。 
(6) 產品模組/多製程技術生產協調之確定性模型 
TFT-LCD 廠營運目標 
TFT-LCD 廠內部多製程產能協調配置規劃之目標乃將規劃期之產能配置成本加
總，並使成本最小化。 
各製程間之缺貨狀態與需求滿足限制式 
廠內規劃之各製程產能並與各期間內各種允諾之產品模組達成平衡。無法即時滿足
生產則產生延遲成本。此外，各階段製程間之運輸亦會產生製程配置成本。 
16 
 
基因演算法之修復機構 
本研究由於需同時支援許多限制式，基因操作過程中染色體交配與突變常產生不可
行解。於此狀況下，本計畫發展以懲罰值為基礎的基因演算法，並搭配修復基因，以限
制不可行解的發生。 
基因演算法之基因操作 
為了使發展之基因演算法具備優異的求解效率，本計畫將染色體結構/特性採用多種
交配與突變方式，使發展之基因演算法於搜尋解答過程中更具多樣性與豐富性。 
(8) 發展生產控制面之協商式產能配置模型 
TFT-LCD 最適產能配置決策智慧型代理人可於確定之訂單資訊、有限產能限制下，
進行產能協調配置與多製程技術組構決策，並下達可接受之訂單組合、並以日為單位做
切割，明述批量與交期時間，俾使生產作業順利進行。 
本計畫成果所建構之多製程產能環境下之協商模型，透過自主性協商決定資源配
置。代理人之間（多廠、各型技術、產品模組之間），以集團對集團的方式進行協商，
過程中相互不須知道對方所擁有的籌碼及協商底線，雙方並分別透過代理人針對議題進
行協商。對另一方提出提議值（Offer），並接收對方的反提議值（Counter offer）。 
本研究所採用之「協商決策函式」(Negotiation decision functions, NDF)協商機制與
折衝（Negotiation Trade-offs）機制，可使代理人依據 TFT-LCD 生產企劃中之產能配置
結果，遂行生產控制衝突下之產能配置協調。本研究並比較不同系統參數（議題權重、
協商戰術）下之反應。為評估協商之績效表現，本研究以柏拉圖最佳化曲線
（Pareto-optimal line）做為衡量標準，探討資訊分散情況下，代理人透過協商機制所獲
得之協議與最佳解之差距。議價與折衝協商包含了協商戰略(Negotiation strategies)、協商
戰術(Negotiation tactics)及多方協商函式(Multilateral negotiation functions)等三個層次，而
戰術層次包含了時間相依(Time dependent tactics)、資源相依(Resource dependent tactics)

computer model than on a real system with real 
people, equipment, and processes. SD can be 
applied in various fields, such as analyzing mine 
disasters, dealing failure and robustness in single 
development projects, and working on e-commerce 
strategies. SD can also be combined with other 
management tools: for instance, to combine system 
dynamics with conjoint analysis for strategic 
decision making. 
This study not only constructs a common 
business model, but also constructs the other two 
new potential business models. This study uses 
Powersim® simulation software to build the system 
dynamics models and evaluates via scenario-based 
simulation for the case company of this study.  
Model Construction 
For the construction of business models, this study 
sets the followings assumptions: (1) Only a single 
product exists. (2) The demand of a product 
subjects to a normal distribution (Normal (μ = 2.5, 
σ = 0.8) (Number / Day). The forecast uses a naive 
method that the forecast of the upcoming period is 
equal to the actual sales of the last period. (3) No 
backorder. (4) The payment collection risk subjects 
to a Uniform distribution (Uniform (0,1)) (5) The 
account receivables will not recover if such failure 
occurs. (6) The product price is inversely 
proportional to its remaining life cycle. (7) Product 
unit cost is inversely proportional to its remaining 
life cycle. (8) Installment interests uses a simple 
interest calculation. (9) After the product reaches 
its maturity stage in life cycle, it continues to be 
sold.  
In this study, the product life cycle and 
technology development is classified as Sustained 
Matured Products (Type A), Rapid Matured 
Products (Type B), Slow Matured Products (Type C) 
and Entire Life-Cycle Products (Type D). The 
following section describes the technology 
life-cycle cost and price assumptions.  
Product types  
There are four types of products addressed in 
the study, sustained mature products, rapid matured 
products, slow matured products and entire life 
cycle products.  
The technology life-cycle curve of Sustained 
Mature Products (Type A) is constant, such as 
daily necessities, The demand is stable, The 
product technology is difficult to get a 
breakthrough. The unit price and cost is constant as 
shown in Figure 1.

Kuznets (1930) proposed S-curve model for 
describing future technological change in the 
technology evolution. Foster (1986) advocated that 
S curve can be used to establish a technology life 
cycle and present the results of technology 
development. 
The S curve equation is given below:

Y βα ++= 1
1 where Yt is the technical performance 
at time t; K1 is the upper limit of technology 
performance; α is the parameter of lower limit of 
technology performance; and β : shape parameter.  
The lower limit of technology performance, 
u1, is defined as follows for simulation use. The 
parameter α is converted to be the function of the 
lower limit of technology performance.

Figure 2. Technology life cycle curve (Type B) 
The rapid matured products in the life cycle 
technology saturate within a short time, such as 
consumer electronics products. We assumed that 
the time of technology life cycle is inversely 
proportional to the product price. The price is high 
during products introducing to the market, and the 
scale of demand and production is small. When the 
product technology is matured, the price and cost is 
lowed. The S-curve formula is defined as follows: ( )( )

sales profit. The sales profit considers revenue and 
sales cost. There are two types of costs, inventory 
cost and the risk of disbursement payment for 
goods by checks. Base on the causal feedback loop 
as aforementioned, we construct system dynamics 
of the basic business model by using Powersim as 
shown in Figure 10. The system dynamics model 
also includes two subsystems of the technology 
performance and sales loss.

Figure 10. The basic business model represented in 
system dynamics 
A sale-combined-with-installment-service 
business model (denoted as m2) is proposed by the 
study as follows. In the basic business model as 
aforementioned, customers pay the payment by 
checks for three months. Since the credit 
investigation ability of the instrument manufacturer 
is not good enough, the checks have high risk that 
cannot be cashed and thus cause loss of sales. 
Financial service industry of leasing, installment 
and factoring is well-developed up-to-date. The 
installment service industry can provide installment 
service for customers. From the instrument 
manufacturers’ perspective, by integrating 
installment service companies in the existing 
business model, they can receive the payment for 
goods quickly to increase turnover rate and transfer 
the risk to installment service companies. From the 
customers’ aspects, they can reduce the pressure of 
gathering mass capital and reserve cash on hand to 
decrease the managerial risk. From the installment 
service providers’ viewpoint, they can earn the

Conclusions 
This study has developed three business models 
which have been justified by system dynamics 
simulation in different settings of situations to 
advise the case company for choosing its 
appropriate business model against various product 
life-cycles. Profitable suggestion for applying as 
well as shifting to the most appropriate business 
model are given for different viewpoints of 
instrument manufacturers, channel agents, and 
financial service companies. The proposed system 
dynamics evaluation method can reduce survey 
time for business and lower operational cost.  
As a conclusion to our research, we have 
shown that: (i) Firms with products under growth 
or mature stage of life cycle adopt/switch 
appropriate business revenue models conforming to 
their requirements in different stages and result in 
high performance outcomes than those remaining 
in a single business revenue model. (ii) Business 
revenue models represented by causal loops of 
system dynamics and examined by system 
simulation capture not only steady states but 
transient states of business activities. By taking 
advantages of the proposed approach, managers 
can thus efficiently make right decisions for 
reducing time and cost.

Abstract 
Business revenue modelling is one of the important 
aspects of enterprise planning to create values for 
enterprises. In this study, we construct a system 
dynamics simulation model to evaluate various 
business revenue models applied to e-platforms. 
Machining tools industry is investigated as a case 
study. Products with different life cycles are 
examined as applying different business models. 
Computational experiments are conducted and 
results are discussed. Specific research 
issues/contributions of the study include: 1. To 
propose four effective business revenue models in 
such an industry. 2. To evaluate the proposed 
business revenue models as well as their 
advantages/disadvantages by a system dynamics 
simulation. 3. To address managerial implications 
of these business revenue models to the industry. 
As a conclusion to our research, we show that: (i) 
Firms with products under growth or mature stage 
of life cycle adopt/switch appropriate business 
revenue models conforming to their requirements 
in different stages and result in high performance 
outcomes than those remaining in a single business 
revenue model. (ii) Business revenue models 
represented by causal loops of system dynamics 
and examined by system simulation can capture not 
only steady states but transient states of business 
activities. By taking advantages of the proposed 
approach, managers can thus efficiently make right 
decisions for reducing time and cost.

Introduction 
Business model is important to enterprise for 
earning profit [1,2,3,4]. Even an enterprise has 
excellent quality of products and services, the lack 
of a good business model still cannot obtain high 
profit. Enterprises cannot find their suitable 
business model by try-and-error which would leads 
to fatal failure. System Dynamics (SD) and 
simulation is a powerful tool to examine suitable 
business models for enterprises [5,6,7]. 
In this study, a case company in the 
measurement instrument industry is investigated. It 
currently follows a traditional business model, in 
which the firm's products are sold through direct 
sales force, distribution, OEM and sales agents to 
customers. However, the quality and technical 
ability of the products provided by the other firms 
in this industry is almost the same. There is few 
gaps between the firm and its competitors and thus 
weaken the ability of its revenue growth [3,5]. This 
study aims at examining potential profitable 
business models, and opened the gap with its 
competitors.  
According to above description for the 
background and motivation has established the 
following three objectives: 1. To propose potential 
business models. 2. To develop a system dynamics 
simulation model to assess the advantages of the 
proposed models. 3. To assist enterprise 
applications in the business model.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Literature review in section two is conducted to 
define business model, performance evaluation and 
system dynamics modeling methodology. In 
section 3, we establish several novel business 
models and use system dynamics to represent their 
system architecture. Section 4 uses scenario-based 
simulation to investigate the outcomes of different 
models. Finally, conclusion and recommendation is 
in given in section 5. 
Literature Review 
Business model is defined by Magretta [8]. 
Business model is actually a story of how to 
operate a company and is a plan to make money. 
System dynamics (SD) is a powerful tool in the 
creation of feedback theories. Many guidelines and 
case studies have been developed by founders and 
practitioners of this field for the model building 
process and a series of tests to build confidence in 
the models created. An SD approach can be used to 
demonstrate how managing processes of 
accumulation and depletion of strategic assets, 
detecting inertial effects of decisions to help 
entrepreneurs in understanding opportunities and 
pitfalls related to e-commerce strategies. SD is a 
method of solving problems by computer 
simulation. Like many simulation methods, it offers 
the promise of less expensive learning to 
experiment with the effect of new policies on a 
computer model than on a real system with real 
people, equipment, and processes. SD can be 
applied in various fields, such as analyzing mine 
disasters, dealing failure and robustness in single 
development projects, and working on e-commerce

Business models  
There are three business models addressed in 
the study, basic business model, 
sale-combined-with-installment-service business 
model, and with-installment-and-agent business 
model. 
The basic business model (denoted as m1) 
is shown in Figure 8. A company employs sales 
records as the basis for demand forecasting and 
develops its production plans. When the demand is 
less than planned production, inventory is kept in a 
warehouse. After shipping, customers pay by 
checks of three-months.

Resulted from the simulation, the 
measurement instrument company is suggested to 
adopt the following strategies as shown in Table 3. 
For instance, in order to deal with the sustained 
mature products (Type A) the company can employ 
Sale-combined-with-installment-service business 
Model (m2). For the rapid matured products (Type 
B), slow matured products (Type C) and entire 
life-cycle products (Type D), in the initial stage of 
product introduction, the 
With-installment-and-agent business model (m3) 
are adopted, when the products become mature, the 
models are suggested to shift to the 
Sale-combined-with-installment-service business 
model (m2).
