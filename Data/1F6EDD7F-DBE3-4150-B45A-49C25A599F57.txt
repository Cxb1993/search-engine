such an approach requires complicated and labor intensive 
assemblies, and therefore is not suitable for mass production. On the 
other hand, triplexer based on planar lightwave circuit (PLC) 
technology is attractive because it overcomes some of the 
inadequacies of the discrete TFF technology as it leads to a compact 
and low-cost packaging. Various schemes for tripe-play WDM filters 
based on PLC technology have been demonstrated [2, 3]. However, 
due to the nature of spectral characteristics, these types of solutions 
are difficult to meet industrial standards on ITU-T G.983.3 
broadband specifications. 
 In this letter, thin WDM filters and lensed fibers on silicon 
substrates was proposed to fabricate a cost-effective optical triplexer. 
The structure of the proposed devices, as shown in Fig. 1, is deduced 
from the conventional triplexers using discrete thin-film filters (TFFs) 
[4]. The thin WDM filters obtained by reducing the substrate 
thickness of the bulk-optical TFFs were used to perform the WDM 
functions. Both the 1.49- and 1.55 μm download signals and the 1.31 
μm upload data were collimated by the lensed fibers to reduce 
insertion losses of the devices. In addition, we employed two 
multi-mode fibers (MMF) to collect the download signals reflected 
from the thin TFFs with 45o incident angle and to deliver the signals 
to correspondent photodetectors. The discrete components of the 
triplexers, including the thin TFFs, the lensed fibers and the MMFs 
 2
working distance of 800 μm with a minimum insertion loss of less 
than 0.5 dB for 1.31-, 1.49-, and 1.55 μm lights. 
 The optical benches for hybrid integration consist of 500 μm 
thick silicon wafers with {100} surfaces. V-grooves were obtained 
by wet etching using KOH solutions. The lensed fibers and the 
MMFs were integrated onto the Si bench using the V-groove 
structures. The trenches for positioning the thin TFFs were grooved 
using a dicing machine with a 60 μm thick diamond blade. Finally, 
the lensed fibers, the MMFs and the thin TFFs were inserted into V- 
and U-grooves on the silicon bench using a UV curable epoxy. After 
packaging, including the sections for positioning ribbon fibers, the 
proposed triplexer achieves a dimension of 8 mm by 18 mm. 
Results and Discussion: The spectral responses, including the 
transmission and the reflection spectrums, of the video and the data 
TFFs before and after the substrate thinning processes are shown in 
Fig. 2. Unpolarized light sources over a wavelength range of 1200 
nm to 1600 nm were used for the measurement. The spectral 
responses of the ITU-T G.983.3 require a 100 nm bandwidth at the 
1.31 μm upload signal, a 20 nm bandwidth at the 1.49 μm DPIN 
channel, and a 10 nm bandwidth at the 1.55 μm APIN channel. The 
vertical dashed lines in Fig. 2 indicate the expanding of the three 
bands of interest. As illustrated in the figure, no significant changes 
of the spectral responses were observed within these bands after the 
 4
of the proposed triplexer shows that they can be used for FTTP 
applications.  
Conclusion: We have demonstrated a cost-effective optical triplexer 
by hybrid integrating the thin WDM filters, the lensed fibers and the 
MMFs on the silicon benches using passive alignment techniques. 
The proposed triplexers achieve a fiber-to-fiber insertion losses were 
less than 1.2 dB, and a power variation of less than 0.8 dB within the 
required bandwidths at a substrate temperature of 100 oC.
