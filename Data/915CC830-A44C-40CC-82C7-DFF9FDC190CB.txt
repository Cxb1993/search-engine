The initial applications of SSFM to reduce EMI emissions
have been in communications and microprocessor systems de-
sign. Even now, the frequency modulation technique is still an
important approach to reducing EMI in many digital systems.
Many different SSFM techniques have been developed to reduce
the EMI on switching power converters [7], [11]. However, the
design complexity, power dissipation, efficiency issues, and chip
cost limit the applications of these techniques to the PWM mode
amplifier and converter integrated circuit design [12]–[18]. The
complex spread spectrum clock generation circuits usually re-
duce the power efficiency and increase the cost of PWM inte-
grated circuits [11], [12]. Some complex spread spectrum cir-
cuits even need high operating currents, which greatly reduce
the power efficiency of the circuits. Besides, all of these EMI
reduction techniques for PWM circuits are applied on power
converters designs [7]–[13], especially on board-level converter
system designs. Due to the issue of harmonic distortion, apply-
ing an SSFM technique to a switching power amplifier design
is much more difficult than a switching power converter de-
sign. The total harmonic distortion (THD) effects and power
efficiency reduction issues are the major problems in designing
a low-EMI switching power amplifier. Especially, in the switch-
ing power amplifier design, an input signal needs to be amplified
with very little distortion. The spread spectrum technique will
cause the increase of harmonic distortion when it is applied to
reduce the EMI in PWM circuits. Very few researches have been
conducted on the topic of low-EMI switching power amplifier
designs. It is a great challenge for the designer to overcome these
two problems. In this paper, a simple, effective, and ultralow-
power technique is designed to intentionally broaden and flatten
the spectrum of the switching power amplifier integrated circuit
while achieving the minimum impact on the efficiency and THD
performance of the audio power amplifier. This novel amplifier
also employs a negative feedback technique to improve the THD
problem.
In this paper, we will focus on the analysis and design of
the low-power spread spectrum clock generator (SSCG). The
structure of the low-EMI switching power amplifier is intro-
duced in Section II. The spread spectrum method and circuit are
described in this section. Measurement results are presented in
Section III. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section IV.

II. NEW LOW-EMI CLASS-D POWER AMPLIFIER
A. Structure of the Class D Power Amplifier
A block diagram of the feedback control class D power am-
plifier is shown in Fig. 2 [13]. If we change the values of the
resistance and capacitance of the feedback circuit, the output
amplitude can be adjusted. Using a digital control circuit, the
frequency of the clock signal can be adjusted. A traditional class
D amplifier uses the triangular wave and error signal penetra-
tion comparator to obtain the PWM signal. In this PWM circuit,
the audio signal (Vin ) is added to the pseudo triangular carrier
(Vsum ), as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.
This triangular-like carrier is generated by integrating an al-
most 50% duty cycle square wave with a simple RC integrator
(Rt and Ct). The comparator consists of a pair of digital in-
verters where the ideal inherent threshold voltage is 1/2 VDD .
When the sum of the audio signal and carrier is lower than the
inherent threshold, the output of the inverter will switch from

The spread spectrum frequency band can be expressed as

. (7)
The ratio of I1 /C1 determines the switching frequency of the
converter. To get a wider spread spectrum frequency band, a
larger ∆V and smaller V1 values can be used [see (7)].
The ∆V is 20 mV (from 0.49 to 0.51 V) in this design. The
frequency of the sawtooth wave is much lower than the switch-
ing frequency. With this arrangement, the switching frequency
range is then randomized between 0.98 and 1.02 MHz, if a
switching frequency of 1 MHz is used. A circuit simulation of
this spread spectrum circuit also shows similar results. Fig. 9

lope frequencies.
Fig. 11. Block diagram depicting the model of open-loop class D amplifier.
shows the frequency bands of 0.04 MHz and 0.08 MHz when
∆V of 20 mV and 40 mV are used for the circuit simulation,
respectively. The modulation of the clock frequency can spread
the energy of each single harmonic into a certain frequency
band, thus reducing the peak amplitude of EMI at the switching
and harmonic frequencies. The reduction in the 1 MHz switch-
ing frequency spectrum peak is 18 dB (refer to 0 dB). The peak
spectrum reduction in the third harmonic is 20 dB as shown
in Fig. 10. We see that the noise power spectrum peaks are
significantly reduced when the frequency modulation technique
is used. Theoretical model and simulation results both show
the harmonic peak reduction is improved when a larger ∆V is
used. However, the use of a larger ∆V will also have a greater
clock jitter, since the switching frequency is extended into a
frequency band. This clock jitter will cause the signal harmonic
distortion [19]. Therefore, a reasonable compromise between
the EMI reduction and harmonic distortion of amplifier must
be reached in a low-EMI class D amplifier design. A ∆V of
20 mV, which is 4% jitter, is used for this amplifier design. The
increase of harmonic distortion is controlled within an accept-
able level. The simulation results show the increase of THD
is within 0.025% for the whole signal frequency band when a
20 mV ∆V and 42 kHz Vsaw envelope waveform is used for the
spread spectrum circuit.
C. Feedback Control of Power Amplifier
This novel power amplifier employs a negative feedback tech-
nique to improve the THD problem. The open-loop class D
amplifier is shown in Fig. 11. Hff is the forward open-loop

frequency modulation technique.
Fig. 17. Spread spectrum at the output of the power MOSFET using the
frequency modulation technique.
The high switching frequency used in class D amplifiers is
usually a potential source of EMI. The EMI is produced by
fast switching edges. The spread spectrum can effectively re-
duce the slope of the switching edges, which in turn reduce
the strength of the EMI. Figs. 16 and 17 show the simulated
output spectrum of a power MOSFET with and without the fre-
quency modulation technique, respectively. The detailed spread
spectrum effects of switching frequency (1 MHz) and second
harmonic (2 MHz) are shown in Fig. 18 with a narrow frequency
range. A 12 kHz signal with amplitude of 0.25 V is used for
both Fig. 18(a) and (b) simulations, and a 20 kHz signal with
amplitude of 0.25 V is used for Fig. 18(c) simulation. Without
applying spread spectrum technique the sideband frequencies
can clearly be observed in the harmonic spectrum of MOSFET
output [21], [22]. The fc and fa represent the switching fre-
quency and the signal frequency, respectively. A 20 mV ∆V
of the envelope (Vsaw ) is used for the spread spectrum simula-
tion. We see that the fundamental-frequency peak is reduced by
14 dB, the second harmonic peak is reduced by 15.5 dB, and the
third harmonic by 16 dB. The noise power spectrum peaks of
switching pulses are reduced significantly when the frequency
modulation technique is used.
III. MEASUREMENT RESULTS
The chip has been fabricated using a Taiwan Semiconduc-
tor Manufacture Company (TSMC) 2P4M 0.35-µm polycide

and (c) with a 20 kHz signal. The dashed line represents the spectrum of power
MOSFET output with spread-spectrum technique, and the solid line represents
the spectrum without using spread-spectrum technique.
CMOS process. A photograph of the class D amplifier is
shown in Fig. 19. The chip area including the I/O pads is
1.8 mm× 1.8 mm. The area of power MOSFETs occupies most
of the chip area. The triangular wave and the string mixed wave
profile (Vsum ) are measured and shown in Fig. 20. The mixed
waveform becomes a PWM signal through an inverter. The load
used in this design is 8 Ω. Fig. 21 shows the measured spectrum
of the driving pulses at the gate of the power MOSFET, while
Fig. 22 shows the measured spectrum of driving pulses when
SSCG is turned ON. The switching frequency used for these
experimental results is 1 MHz. The frequency and amplitude of
the input signal (Vin ) are 12 kHz and 0.25 V, respectively. The
VDD applied is 1.5 V. The frequency and ∆V of the envelope
(Vsaw ) are 42 kHz and 20 mV, respectively. It shows that the
noise peak of the switching frequency is reduced by 13.5 dB,
while the second and third harmonic peaks are reduced by 16
and 19 dB, respectively.

decrease in power efficiency. However, power efficiency drop
due to the SSCG is negligible since the power dissipation of
the proposed SSCG is only 112 µW in this amplifier design.
Table I shows a performance comparison with recently pub-
lished class D amplifiers.
IV. CONCLUSION
A class D audio power amplifier with a low-power SSCG
has been presented in this paper. This harmonic noise peaks
reduced audio amplifier has the advantages of low THD, high
power-conversion efficiency, low-output dc static current, and
a simple RC feedback circuit. The controllable and adjustable
switching frequency of this amplifier also provides it with great
potential for reducing the EMI. The measured results showed
that the proposed low-power frequency modulation technique
can greatly reduce the noise peaks while having only a small
impact on the power efficiency and THD of the amplifier.

Figure 5: Transistor “on” time is from start of sawtooth until the sawtooth 
crosses Vea_out. 
 
Through feedback mechanism, the error ampliﬁer as 
shown in Figure 4 compares a fraction of the output voltage 
VFB to a voltage reference Vref (produced by bandgap) and 
produces an error voltage Ver_out. Ver_out is compared to 
the sawtooth Vsaw in a voltage comparator (PWM). Note that 
the fraction of the output VFB is fed to the inverting input of 
the error ampliﬁer so that when Vo goes up, the error 
ampliﬁer output Ver_out goes down. 
In the PWM voltage comparator, the sawtooth is fed to the 
non-inverting input and Ver_out is fed to the inverting input. 
As shown in Figure 5 the PWM output is a negative-going 
pulse of variable width. The pulse is negative for the entire 
time the sawtooth is below the DC level of the error ampliﬁer 
output Ver_out. As the DC output voltage goes slightly 
positive, VFB goes slightly positive, and Vea_out goes 
negative and closer to the bottom of the sawtooth. Thus the 
duration of the negative going pulse Vpwm decreases. 
Regulation against load current changes occurs only after the 
current changes cause small output voltage changes. 
 
III.  THE FILTER-LESS CLASS D AMPLIFIER 
The whole filter-less class D audio power amplifier circuit 
structure is shown in Figure 6 which consists of the 
Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) modulator, the gate driver, a 
full-bridge output stage, the feedback circuit, and a speaker 
load. The upper side and the lower side of the circuit are 
almost symmetrical, except the sample node in the feedback 
circuit and the number of PWM inverters. Input audio signal

(Vs) is fed in the both two parts in class D circuit and produces 
a pair of PWM signal they are in out of phase. The pair of 
PWM signal is output to the speaker load through the 
full-bridge output stage. 
 
A. PWM modulator 
The PWM modulator in the class D audio amplifier is 
shown in Figure 7 which can be subdivided into two parts. 
The first part is the integrator amplifier which consists of the 
resistors, a capacitor, and an operational amplifier. The 
second part is the PWM inverter. 
The functions of the integrator amplifier are not only to 
generate the triangular signal (Vsum) by the input audio signal 
(Vs) and the clock (VClock) to the PWM inverter for the PWM 
signal, but also playing the role of a pre-amplifier to ensure 
that the gain large enough for the whole class D system. 
Vsum is the output of the integrator amplifier and it can be 
expressed as： 
 
                                 (1) 
 
 
The PWM comparator of a traditional PWM generator is 
replaced by an inverter. As shown in Figure 6, the PWM 
inverters in the lower side are one more than upper side. The 
function of the PWM inverter is put to use the triangular 
signal (Vsum) generating the PWM signal by comparing the 
Vsum to the threshold voltage (Vth) of the PWM inverter. The

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The circuit is simulated using HSPICE environment. 
Figure 14 shows the output voltage of the PWM buck 
converter when Vin is varied from 3V to 5V at 400uS. Further 
Figure 15 shows the output voltage of the PWM buck 
converter when Vin is varied from 5V to 3V at 600uS. 
The output ripple voltage is within 32mV when a 1.51V 
steady-state output voltage is generated from a 3V to 5V input 
supply. 
The efficiency of the converter is shown in Figure 16 with 
the input voltage is varied from 3V to 5V and the output 
voltage of 1.5V. The maximum efficiency is 97% at loading 
current 50 mA. This converter can supply a high-efficiency of 
90% for a wide output current range from 3 to 400 mA. 
We used the 8Ω resistor and the 15uH inductor in series as 
the typically speaker model as the load of the class D 
amplifier. Figure 17 and Figure 18 show the output signal 
waveform and the output signal spectrum with the 10K Hz 
sine input signal. 
The total harmonic distortion (THD) versus the frequency 
of the input audio signal is shown in Figure 20. 
When buck converter input 3.6V, the total power 
efficiency of the converter and the amplifier with the different 
output power is shown in Figure 16. The best efficiency of the 
total power efficiency can be achieves 84%.
