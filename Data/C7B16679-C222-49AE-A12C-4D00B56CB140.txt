Abstract 
Cerebrovascular disease was one of the leading causes of mortality in Taiwan in the past decade. 
Poor cerebral autoregulation (CA) is one of the important crucial factors that cause cerebrovascular 
diseases. Cerebral autoregulation (CA) refers to the phenomenon that cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains 
relatively constant in healthy human subjects despite large systemic changes in mean arterial blood 
pressure (MABP). This study first year is focused on developing the clinical data acquisition and 
analysis system for monitoring CA in patients with diabetes, stroke and hypertension. Beat-to-beat time 
series of continuous arterial blood pressure were obtained from Finapres device. Cerebral blood flow 
velocity signals were obtained from transcranial Doppler (TCD). Both signals assessed the cerebral 
autoregulation using linear and nonlinear approaches in different periods during before and after 
antihypertensive drug treatments. The results showed that linear analysis and nonlinear analysis, 
especially cross correlation function (CCF) and correlation dimension (CD) can provide more clear 
results, and it might be more helpful to diagnose in clinical practice. The second year, we classified the 
MABP and MCBFV in normal subjects and diabetic patients using the linear results of the first year. The 
MABP and MCBFV signals were bandpass-filtered in the low-frequency range (LF, 0.07-0.15 Hz) and 
high-frequency range (HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz) before applying CCFs as inputs of the adaptive resonance 
theory (ART) network. The results showed that 100% CCFs in normal subjects could be classified in 
both LF and HF ranges. However, only 18.80% CCFs in patients without diabetic autonomic neuropathy, 
17.64% CCFs in patients with mild diabetic autonomic neuropathy, and 21.88% CCFs in patients with 
severe diabetic autonomic neuropathy were classified as normal CCFS in HF range. In the LF range, 
73.58% CCFs in patients without diabetic autonomic neuropathy, 59.26% CCFs in patients with mild 
diabetic autonomic neuropathy, and 45.05% CCFs in patients with severe diabetic autonomic neuropathy 
were classified as normal CCFS. Furthermore, 12 features including mean and variance of maximum 
CCF value as well as time lag of positions of maximum CCF are extracted from three frequency ranges 
frequency (VLF, 0.015-0.07Hz, LF, and HF). Four groups of subjects are classified using a support 
vector machine classifier. The overall classification rate achieves 87.5% under the leave-one-out cross 
validation evaluation scheme. The third year we have joined the nonlinear parameters in the 
classification. The CCFs and CDs of pre-filtered spontaneous MABP and MCBFV were computed. 
Twelve CCF features and one CD feature were extracted from three frequency ranges. The feature 
vectors are classified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier; and a classification rate of 
91.67% is obtained under the leave-one-out cross validation evaluation scheme. This very encouraging 
result indicates that the proposed linear and nonlinear features between MABP and MCBFV can be 
effective features to discriminate diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy. 
Keywords： Cerebral autoregulation, mean arterial blood pressure, mean cerebral blood flow velocity, 
adaptive resonance theory network, support vector machine.

圖一、系統架構 
2.受測者

(含)以上小於80 歲(含)以下；(2).第一次發生腦中風患者(first-ever stroke)及第二次發生腦中風患

心血管病史或正在治療之相關疾病。 
3.線性分析方法 
A.時域分析 
(a)平均值與標準差 
人體生理訊號的變化，如血壓、心跳以及腦血流的變化，可視為一種隨機訊號，所以將每次
血壓、心跳或是腦血流變化的發生視為一種隨機變數（random variable）ri，m 為其平均值，且假
設每次發生的機率 pi都是獨立的。接著，便可以由公式（1）與公式（2）得到此隨機訊號的期望

由上面的這些關係可以看出︰求出相關函數後，對他取傅立葉轉換，便是功率頻譜密度。反過來，
求出功率頻譜密度後，取傅立葉反轉換便是相關函數，或先將時域的訊號轉為頻域訊號，再求出
功率頻譜密度。 
隨機訊號 x(t)離散取樣得 x(n)，對它們做 FFT 運算便得訊號的頻譜

kSxy =               (7) 
4.非線性分析方法 
A.混沌理論 
混沌意指動力系統中由固有的非線性造成之一種不規則現象及不可測的行為 [23,24]。在混沌
理論中，一串事件可能有一個臨界點，在此點上，小的變化可放大為大的變化。這描述了對初始
條件的敏感度，也是著名的”蝴蝶效應”(Butterfly effect)－今天紐約一隻蝴蝶展翅起舞對空氣造成
的擾動，可能觸發下個月北京的暴風雨，如圖三所示。 
 
圖三、蝴蝶效應 
B.重構方法 
將初始的時間序列重繪成一新的座標系統”相空間”，來重構一個”吸子﹙attractor﹚”，這也就
是所謂的重構方法 [25]。重構主要是要看出混沌的特徵，也就是系統的規則性、複雜度。相空間
可定義為在系統中的瞬間狀態之直角座標數學空間，吸子可定義為在系統動力行為發展方向進行
中之軌跡所描繪得一組點。如圖四，假設 τ 延遲時間，dm 為嵌入維(表示能完全包容吸子的最小
相空間的維度)，然後一個 dm 維的狀態向量 X(t)由 x(t)當第一座標，x(t+τ)為第二座標，x(t+(dm-1)τ)
為最後一個座標： 
{ ))1((,),(),()( ττ −++= dmtxtxtxtX L  (8)

Slope=CD
R
CD(R)
 
圖六、關聯維值 
D. Lyapunov exponent (LE) 
LE 是用來定量分析混沌行為的方式，為測量吸子的初態敏感度。LE 的物理意義是吸子中鄰
近軌跡發散的指數率。用來度量相空間中的兩條相鄰軌跡間吸引或分離的程度。如下圖七所示，
假設在時間 t=0 時，鄰近的軌跡之兩點的最初距離為 dL(0)，然後在 t=t 時因軌跡發散而距離變成
dL(t)，因此：

圖七、Lyapunov exponent 
正的 LE 值表示系統的動力行為是混沌的，負值或零則表示有規律的行為。對於一個 N 維的吸子，
會有 N 個 LE 值 [28]。 
E. Kolmogorov entropy 
Kolmogorov entropy 功能近似 Lyapunov exponent。Entropy 是從熱力學觀念而來的，意思是指
百分之百的能量轉移是不可能的。假設起始信息是 S(t1)，經一時間 t2-t1 後，信息為 S(t2)，信息的
改變量為 K(t2-t1)，則 S(t2)=S(t1)+ K(t2-t1)，延伸下去可寫成： 
)(

d
d
+
=                    (12) 
而一個規則的系統，K=0；一個隨機的系統，K 為無窮大，只有混沌系統，K 值才為正值，且為
有限的 [29]。

B.支持向量機(SVM) 
支持向量機(SVM)是一種分類技術，其目的是在訓練的樣本中產生一個可預測不同類群的標
籤模型，支持向量機(SVM)的訓練模式是將先訓練樣本中的資料映射至一個高維度的空間中而支
持向量機(SVM)是在這高維度的空間中找出一個可將不同的群組分隔的線性超平面[21]。假設訓練
樣本是線性可分離的其函數定義為：

其中 ix 代表第 i 個訓練樣本，而 iy 代表第 i 個訓練樣本的標籤， l為訓練樣本的總量，n 為特徵空

五、結果與討論 
腦中風病人分析結果發現，用藥後腦中風病人在被動搖起時的平均血壓  (治療前為
127.55±31.21 mmHg；治療後為86.68±9.28 mmHg, p<0.05)及平均腦血流速MCBFV(治療前為
71.38±35.68cm/s；治療後為68.71±26.41 cm/s)，均有下降之趨勢。阻力指標、調控指標及交越相關
分析皆顯示降血壓藥物有助於改善腦中風病患的腦血流調控。頻域分析則發現治療後能降低血壓
及血流低、高頻頻帶的能量，顯示其對自律神經系統有抑制之影響(治療前平均血壓LFsupine: 
2.86±1.97mmHg2, LFtilting: 9.15±10.60 mmHg2; 治療後3 個月平均血壓LFsupine: 2.02±1.23 mmHg2, 
LFtilting:7.46±6.63 mmHg2)。非線性分析結果顯示中風病人在高血壓藥物治療後，非線性參數值會
上升，可推測腦血流調控系統會趨向正常。過去對於急性期腦中風之高血壓治療是爭議的，但根
據結果顯示中風病人在高血壓藥物治療後，腦血流調控系統會趨向正常，因此建議急性期腦中風
之高血壓治療是可行的。兩組高血壓患者在給予降血壓藥物治療後，血壓皆有下降之趨勢

Abstract 
The cerebral autoregulation (CA) refers to the 
ability of the brain to maintain constant cerebral 
blood flow. The study is to assess the effect of 
antihypertensive treatment on cerebral 
autoregulation using correlation dimension (CD) in 
stroke patients. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) and 
cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals were 
acquired simultaneously and analyzed to assess 
cerebral autoregulation in both supine and head-up 
tilt positions. 10 stroke-hypertensive patients (56.4±
11.9 years) were treated by taking antihypertensive 
drug, Cozaar. Results revealed that the values of 
mean ABP were reduced significantly (p<0.05) after 
treatment 3 months in both supine and head-up tilt 
positions (before treatment in supine: 129.50±20.12 
mmHg, tilting: 120.90±16.41 mmHg; treatment after 
3 months in supine: 94.80±11.55 mmHg, tilting: 
86.00 ± 6.91 mmHg). In the results of spectral 
analysis, low and high frequency power of MABP 
were both decreased significantly (p<0.05) (before

9.15±10.60 mmHg2; after treatment 3 months MABP 
LFsupine: 2.02 ± 1.23 mmHg2, LFtilting: 7.46 ± 6.63 
mmHg2). It revealed the antihypertensive drug could 
suppress the activity of autonomic nerve system. 
Correlation dimension results indicated the CD 
values of MABP and MCBFV were increased after 
treatment, especially MABP increased significantly 
(p<0.05). Previous published data showed normal 
condition would come to a higher CD value. 
Therefore, CA system in stroke patients would tend 
to be normal after antihypertensive treatment.

age-matched healthy control subjects were studied. 
Twenty-five diabetics had mild autonomic 
neuropathy (67.52±8.79 years) and 18 diabetics 
were diagnosed with severe autonomic 
neuropathy (63.72 ± 11.01 years). The 
determination of the presence of prominent 
autonomic neuropathy was based on a battery of 
autonomic reflex tests (more than two abnormal 
response in the following tests: heart rate response 
to deep breathing, response to Valsalva maneuver, 
skin sympathetic response and postural blood 
pressure test) according to the consensus 
conference in 1992. The diabetic patients have no 
stroke history. Supine blood pressure was not 
different among three groups (p>0.05). The 
patients did not discontinue their therapy of one 
or two times oral intake of Sulfonylureas and 
Metformin per day. The healthy control subjects 
were included only if they had no history of 
cardiovascular disease, heart problems, 
hypertension, migraine, epilepsy, cerebral 
aneurysm, intracerebral bleeding or other 
pre-existing neurological conditions. None of the 
control subjects took any medication during the 
period of the study. The study had been approved 
by the Research Ethics Committee of 
Cheng-Ching General Hospital. All subjects were 
informed consent prior to entry to the study. 
 
4. Data acquisition 
Continuous cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) was 
measured in the middle cerebral artery using Transcranial 
Doppler ultrasound (TCD, EME TC2020, Nicolet 
Instruments, Warwick, UK) in conjunction with a 5-MHz 
transducer fixed by an elastic headband over the temporal 
bones. Continuous arterial blood pressure recordings were 
obtained using the Finapres (Model 2300, Ohmeda, 
Englewood, CO) device with the cuff attached to the middle 
finger of the right hand.  
Subjects were studied on a tilt-table that enabled a 
motor-driven change from a supine to an upright 
position 75° within 4 seconds. Data acquisition 
was started after a 10-min relaxation in supine 
position. ABP and CBFV waveforms were 
recorded simultaneously at 60 Hz to PC for 
off-line analysis. The acquisition periods were 
approximately 5 minutes in both the supine and 
75° head-up tilt positions. Data acquisition was 
performed using a general-purpose data 
acquisition board (NI PCI-1200, National 
Instruments) and LabVIEW (LabVIEW 6.0, 
National Instruments) acquisition software 
developed in our laboratory (Fig. 1).

5. Higher order crossings (HOC) 
The number of observed zero-crossings was 
determined in a finite time series oscillating after 
removing the mean value. This counting 
procedure was repeated after application of a 
differential filter. The filtered signal was filtered 
again and the number of resulting zero-crossings 
will be determined. The resulting series of filter 
order (number of filtering) and zero-crossing 
counts at each filter stage were referred as higher 
order crossings. The number of zero-crossings 
observed in a finitely long real-valued time series 
can be used as a measure of the oscillation 
exhibited in the time-series. In general, if more 
oscillations are present then the expected numbers 
of zero-crossings is higher. Conversely, fewer 
zero-crossings are expected when the time series 
is rather “smooth” and slowly varying. In addition, 
normalized zero-crossing rate can be used to 
estimate the highest existing frequency in the 
signal. The number of zero-crossings and 
normalized zero-crossing rate in discrete time can 
be calculated as follows [11-12].

and diabetics with severe AN. The results are shown as average reciprocal 
values of difference between counts for MABP and MCBFV, 
CUMUDIFFHOC, for filter range index 1 to 20. 
Our study showed that the fluctuations of blood 
pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow velocity 
(CBFV) were not different in supine position 
between diabetics and healthy subjects. But 
during orthostatic stress, MABP and MCBFV 
levels were lower in diabetic patients as compared 
to healthy subjects.  This has been shown also by 
other investigators as well [5,13]. Diabetic 
patients experienced a tilt induced fall in blood 
pressure (Table 1) and in cerebral blood flow 
(Table 2) greater than in healthy subjects. It 
indicates that diabetic neuropathy decreased the 
vasoconstrictor response of the vessels and cause 
orthostatic induced lower blood pressure and 
cerebral blood flow. Especially, all tilt induced 
falls of cerebral blood flow are larger in diabetics 
than in healthy (Table 2). It demonstrates that 
cerebral autoregulation is not functioning and 
alters to maintain flow at constant levels in 
diabetics. 
The statistical results revealed a group effect in 
response to head-up tilt among three groups of 
different degree of diabetic neuropathy by using 
the cumulative linear index (CUMUDIFFHOC). In 
addition, the difference between mild and severe 
diabetic autonomic neuropathy was also 
significantly different in supine posture. 
Therefore, HOC could be a simple and useful way 
to distinguish healthy subjects from diabetics 
severe AN and classify the degree of diabetic 
neuropathy without tilting test. 
7. CONCLUSIONS  
We demonstrated that higher order crossing 
analysis of blood pressure and cerebral blood flow 
can capture the characteristic of diabetic 
autonomic neuropathy in time domain. The 
differences of CA in diabetics and healthy 
subjects could be observed via head-up tilt. HOC 
parameters improved the discrimination between 
diabetics with mild autonomic neuropathy and 
healthy subjects. The parameter derived from 
HOC could be a simple and helpful index to 
improve early diagnose and prevention of early 
stage diabetic autonomic neuropathy.

Abstract— Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are common 
cardiovascular diseases nowadays. However, physical 
examinations for cardiovascular diseases are not available 
easily in clinical practice. The main purpose of this study is to 
extract and classify characteristics of arterial pulse waves in 
diabetics and hypertensive patients using artificial neural 
network. It is expected to be a useful way to identify unusual 
arterial pulse waveforms as a risk index for cardiovascular 
diseases. Continuous arterial pulse signal was acquired from 
63 diabetics, 21 hypertensive patients and 25 healthy subjects 
during supine position. In this study, a self-organizing neural 
network system is established to classify the arterial pulse 
waveforms. The classifying system includes two stages. In the 
first stage, the arterial pulse signal was divided into segments 
for extracting characteristics to be the input pattern of neural 
network in the database. The second stage was to test 
unknown samples. Healthy arterial pulse templates were 
created based on these arterial pulse segments to show the 
unusual arterial pulse waveform tendency.  Results revealed 
that there are 13 kinds of arterial pulse templates in healthy 
subjects’ database. Comparing with the arterial pulse 
waveforms templates in healthy subjects’ database, 73% 
diabetics and 90% hypertensive patients can be classified by 
the system. Moreover, 82% patients with severe diabetic 
autonomic neuropathy can be recognized. It can be speculated 
that cardiovascular diseases influence the function of 
autonomic nervous system to control blood pressure and 
changes the arterial pulse waveform. The results indicate 
unusual blood pressure waveforms could be distinguished 
based on healthy database via the neural network system. In 
conclusion, artificial neural network is an effective method to 
classify the arterial pulse waveform and it can be a fast way to 
detect the arterial pulse waveform out of ordinary.

INTRODUCTION 
Cerebrovascular diseases are the top-ten leading 
causes of mortality [1]. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is 
a chronic disease that occurs when the body does 
not produce enough insulin or cannot effectively 
use the insulin. DM leads to irregular metabolism, 
causes disturbances in nutritional and oxygen 
supply of the nervous system with the 
consequences of autonomic neuropathy with 
development of cardio-vagal dysfunction, 
arteriosclerosis, or hypertension. Complications 
of both cardio-vascular and nervous systems are 
the major risk factors for mortality of diabetics. 
According to previous researches, diabetes 
mellitus is the most common case of autonomic 
nervous dysfunctions [2]. Diabetes is one of the 
important risk factors to cause cerebral diseases 
and is a risk factor to cause stroke [3]. Incidence 
of stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes is two- 
to five-fold more than that in healthy persons [4]. 
Many patients with diabetic have no symptoms in 
the early stage and are diagnosed after many 
years of onset of the disease. Several tests have 
been developed to aware autonomic nervous 
system dysfunction in the early onset of diabetes 
[5-7]. On the other hand, hypertension is one of 
the risks that induce cerebrovascular diseases, 
such as heart diseases and stroke. Therefore, 
hypertension and diabetes are common in 
cardiovascular disaeases.  
Most methods are developed for research 
requesting high technical skills, and are difficult 
to apply in clinical practice. There is a need of 
simple objective noninvasive approaches to 
assess cardiovascular diseases for clinical 
practice. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to 
classify arterial pulse waveform using 
self-organizing neural network in diabetics and 
hypertensive patients. Healthy arterial pulse 
waveforms were trained to be templates and to 
establish a database for detecting abnormal or 
unknown arterial pulse waveform and it is 
expected to provide another way to diagnose 
cardiovascular diseases.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

nearby two valley points. Where “A” is the 
diastolic pressure, “B” is systolic pressure,  “C” 
is the action of aortic valve closure and “D” is 
another one diastolic pressure. Pulse training

 Total percentage 19/21 (=90%) 
 
Because arterial pulse wave is derived from 
the interaction between left ventricle and the 
physical properties of the arterial circulation [11], 
the unusual blood pressure wave might reveal the 
interaction between left ventricle and artery 
properties is different form that in healthy 
subjects. On the other hand, blood pressure is 
controlled by the autonomic nervous system. 
Therefore, it can be speculated diabetic 
autonomic neuropathy might change the 
interaction the heart and peripheral vasculature to 
form the unusual blood pressure waves in 
diabetics. 
IV.CONCLUSION 
We demonstrated using neural network to 
classify diabetics, hypertension and healthy 
subjects according to arterial pulse waveforms. 
The fine difference of arterial pulse waveform 
between diabetics and healthy subjects could be 
observed using this algorithm. This approach can 
distinguish 73% diabetics and 90% hypertensive 
patients. It may provide another way to explore 
diabetes. In the future, it is expected to improve 
early diagnose and prevention of early stage 
diabetic autonomic neuropathy in clinical 
practice.

20, 37, 42] based on arterial blood pressure (ABP) and
cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), CA is more a concept
rather than a physically measurable entity [31]. Autoreg-
ulatory index (ARI) is one of the methods generated by
CBFV and ABP values to evaluate CA and it revealed
aging does not affect CA [5, 15, 31, 34]. Phase analysis
using time-domain cross-correlation function (CCF) to
assess the CA showed the relationship between ABP and
CBFV [7, 10, 11, 30, 33, 36]. Spectral and transfer function
analyses of ABP and CBFV performed by fast Fourier
transform (FFT) in normal subjects [14, 49] and autonomic
failure patients [3] to observe the fluctuation of CA system.
However, these methods are to analyze the dynamic rela-
tionship between ABP and CBFV linearly and it might
ignore the nonlinear properties of CA.
Because CBF remains constant despite CPP changes, the
region in this constant level is nonlinear. Some useful
nonlinear information maybe missed and cannot be char-
acterized by using linear analysis. Therefore, it might be
beneficial to analyze CA using nonlinear methods. Panerai
et al. used a second-order mathematical linear model and
nonlinear Volterra-Wiener moving-average approach to
model human dynamic CA [32]. Mitsis et al. applied the
Laguerre-Volterra network methodology to model nonlin-
ear systems for analyzing dynamic CA in human under
orthostatic stress [29]. In addition, chaos theorem, the
nonlinear approach, has been applied to many physiologi-
cal studies, such as heart rate variability (HRV) [6, 13, 23,
48], electroencephalograph (EEG), respiratory rhythm,
speech recognition, blood pressure, and cardiovascular
system [17, 22, 43, 45, 46]. They provided the chaotic
nature in physiological systems. Nevertheless, nonlinear
dynamic CA in diabetics dealt with chaotic analysis was
still rarely discussed.
In this study, the chaotic analysis will be implemented to
assess dynamic CA in diabetics by three nonlinear mea-
sures, correlation dimension (CD), Lyapunov exponent
(LE), and Kolmogorov entropy (K2). CD focuses on the
system’s complexity. LE quantifies the sensitivity of the
system to initial conditions, while the K2 metric evaluates
the degree of chaos in the system. The main purpose of this
study is to investigate and compare the nonlinear compo-
nents of CA from chaotic analysis of mean arterial blood
pressure (MABP) and mean cerebral blood flow velocity
(MCBFV) in normal subjects and diabetics with autonomic
neuropathy. It is expected to be a tool to predict the CA in
diabetes and possible cardiovascular outcome in clinical
practice. Because autonomic nervous system was impaired
in our diabetics, it affected vasomotor control of peripheral
and brain vessels and reduced baroreflex sensitivity. By
using the parameters of chaotic analysis to quantify CA, we
expect that normal autoregulation system would tend to
lower chaos and higher regular, predictable behavior of the
system to initial conditions, but impaired autoregulation
would be more chaotic and less predictable in terms of
chaotic analysis.
2 Methods
2.1 Subjects and measurements
There were two groups of subjects recruited in this study,
i.e., 19 diabetic autonomic neuropathy (63.7 ± 11.0 years,
12 males) and 11 age-matched healthy subjects
(57.4 ± 8.4 years, 8 males). All subjects gave their
informed consent prior to entry to the study and it had been
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Cheng-
Ching General Hospital. The diabetics took one or two oral
hypoglycemic drugs such as Sulfonylureas and Metformin.
Proceeding from a consensus conference in 1992 recom-
mended that three tests (R-R variation, Valsalva maneuver,
and postural blood pressure testing) could be used for
longitudinal testing of the cardiovascular autonomic sys-
tem. The determination of the presence of prominent
autonomic neuropathy was based on a battery of autonomic
reflex tests (more than two abnormal response in the fol-
lowing tests: deep breathing HRV, Valsalva maneuver,
skin sympathetic response, and postural blood pressure
test). The healthy subjects were included only if they had
no history of cardiovascular disease, heart problems,
hypertension, migraine, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm,
intracerebral bleeding or other pre-existing neurological
conditions. None of the subjects were receiving any med-
ication during the period of the study. The diabetics have
no stroke history and their blood pressure is similar to that
in controls in supine position. Subjects were investigated
on a tilt-table that enabled a motor-driven change from a
supine to an upright position 75 within 4 s. Data acqui-
sition was started after a 10-min relaxation in supine
position. Spontaneous ABP and CBFV were recorded
simultaneously to PC for off-line analysis. CBFV was
measured in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial
Doppler ultrasound (TCD, EME TC2020, Nicolet Instru-
ments, Warwick, UK) in conjunction with a 5-MHz
transducer fixed over the temporal bones by an elastic
headband. Continuous ABP recordings were obtained
through the Finapres (Model 2300, Ohmeda, Englewood,
CO) device with the cuff attached to the middle finger of
the right hand. The acquisition periods were approximately
5 min in both the supine and 75 head-up tilt positions by a
self-developed data acquisition system. During the period
of data acquiring, the middle finger of the right hand was
on the arm-table, which always keeps the same amplitude
and position with that of the heart. The personal computer
combined with a general-purpose data acquisition board

2.2.2 Lyapunov exponent
Lyapunov exponent quantifies the sensitivity of the system
to initial conditions. It is an important feature of chaotic
systems and describes how small changes in the state of a
system grow at an exponential rate and eventually domi-
nate the behavior. LE is defined as the long time average
exponential rates of divergence of nearby states. An
example of MABP showing how the LE is calculated is
illustrated in Fig. 6. Assume that the initial time is t and
t = 0, which the distance between the two points on a
trajectory and nearby trajectory are d(0). After a time
interval t, the initial length will evolve into length d(t). The
sequence of differences between d(t) and d(0) is assumed
to increases exponentially. Thus, we can write
dðtÞ ¼ dð0Þekt ! k ¼ 1
t
ln
dðtÞ
dð0Þ
where k is LE. A system is chaotic if the system has a
positive value of LE. The larger value of positive LE, the
more chaotic the system becomes. A system is regular if
that LE value of the system is zero or negative. A system
has n LE values for an n-dimensional attractor.
2.2.3 Kolmogorov entropy
Kolmogorov entropy metric evaluates the degree of chaos
in the system, or the average rate at which information is
generated by the system, or equivalently, the rate at which
current information about the system is lost. Assume that
the starting information, entropy, is S(t1), after a time
interval t2 – t1, the information becomes S(t2). The change
in information is K(t2 – t1). Thus, we can write: S(t2) =
S(t1) + K(t2 – t1). Certainly, S(t1) [ S(t2), so K(t2 – t1) =
S(t1) – S(t2). Assume S(t1) = lnCd(R), S(t2) = lnCd+1(R).
Cd(R) is the correlation function of MABP or MCBFV. The
equation for K2 is calculated as follows.
K2 ¼ ln CdðRÞ

values for diabetic were significantly higher during upright
position as compared to normal subjects (3.3 ± 0.6 vs.
2.8 ± 0.5, P \ 0.05).
4 Discussion
The linear analysis results indicated that the values of
MABP and MCBFV in diabetics decreased more than that
in normal subjects in response to head-up tilt. It might be
speculated that due to the effect of diabetic autonomic
neuropathy that cannot maintain blood pressure and cere-
bral blood flow velocity stable within a period of short
time. Based on the results of (MABP, MCBFV) pairs in
response to head-up tilt, the scatter plot revealed that the
(MABP, MCBFV) pairs in diabetics were separated into
two groups distinctly but not in normal subjects. It could be
another evidence to reveal that diabetics cannot maintain
the relationship between MABP and MCBFV constant
because of the influence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy
on CA. In contrast, normal subjects could keep the rela-
tionship stable due to regular CA function can maintain
blood flow constant in the brain. The difference between
diabetics and normal subjects might be due to the effect of
CA function that CA works more well in normal subjects
than that in diabetics. On the other hand, Valsalva ratio of
heart rate was lower in diabetics as compared to normal. It
might indicate that autonomic neuropathy would affect the
vasomotor tone of peripheral vessels and baroreflex. As
mentioned in the section of methods, the distance between
MABPi and MABPj is calculated using the Euclidean dis-
tance measure, MABPi  MABPj

 2þ
h
xi;2  xj;2
 2þ    þ xi;dm  xj;dm
 21=2: Due to the minus
in MABP, the brain-level blood pressure and the heart-
level blood pressure will have the similar outcome in the
estimation of Euclidean distances. Although the values are
not hydrostatically corrected for brain level, the difference
would be eliminated from the process of the chaotic anal-
ysis and it would not affect the results. Therefore, the blood
pressure is heart-level but it still makes sense to brain-level
for upright position in all subjects.
Correlation dimension describes the complexity of the
time series. The higher the CD value, the more complex the
system. Because CD values of MABP and MCBFV in
diabetics were higher than that in normal subjects, it could
reveal CA system in diabetics was more chaotic. Due to LE
values in diabetics were lower than that in normal subjects
and LE quantified the sensitivity of the system to the initial
condition; it might be the reason that baroreflex control in

relaxing for 5–10 min in supine position to reduce the error
measurement is necessary. Calibration against a reliable
reference arterial pressure is desirable to obviate. In our
previous study [8], we used a personal computer combined
with a general-purpose data acquisition board and Lab-
VIEW environment to develop techniques for acquiring
signals correctly from a Finapres monitor. Consequentially,
the Finapres device can provide an accurate estimate of
blood pressure. TCD is based on the same physics and
principles as those that apply to any sound-producing
device. Ultrasound is a traveling wave of energy that has a
frequency of more than 20,000 Hz. The variability of TCD
flow velocity had been studied by several investigators.
Sorteberg et al. [41] studied side-by-side and day-to-day
variations in 35 normal adults in measurements taken
1 week apart. The standard deviation of the side-by-side
variations was 7% for the middle cerebral artery. The
standard deviation of the day-to-day variations was 12%
for the middle cerebral artery. Maeda et al. [27] performed
a validation study of TCD reproducibility in 15 patients
evaluated twice by a single examiner and later by a second
examiner on separate days. The overall intraobserver cor-
relation for the middle cerebral artery was between 0.71–
0.95. Vriens et al. [44] found the maximum interobserver
difference in TCD-measured mean velocity to be 23 cm/s.
The difference was less than 10 cm/s in 95% of cases.
From these studies, it can be concluded that the relatively
high consistency exists across TCD examinations [2].
However, lack of regular practice with the system would
reduce the accuracy of measurements [38]. In our study,
the examiner has the experience of operating the system for
almost 10 years. Therefore, the measurement of transient
change in ABP and CBFV results can be achieved by
noninvasive, rapid, passive, and simple approaches and it
can make the result more reliable and accurate. The results
might be helpful for clinical practice in assessing the
dynamic CA conditions and can provide critical informa-
tion for physicians.
5 Conclusion
The study demonstrated the results of assessing CA by
chaotic analysis. The significant difference of nonlinear
parameters might stand for autonomic dysfunction in dia-
betics in response to head-up tilt. The results from this
study revealed the nonlinear measures, CD, LE, and K2,
are suitable parameters to explore the nonlinear compo-
nents of dynamic CA in diabetic autonomic neuropathy.
We speculate that regular autoregulation system would
tend to lower chaos and predictable behavior to initial
conditions but impaired autoregulation would be more
chaotic and less predictable in terms of chaotic analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION Abstract—In this study, a self-organizing neural network 
system is presented to classify the real-time electrocardio-gram 
(ECG) signal. This system can not only organize continuous 
analog waveforms but also output useful recognition codes. The 
system contains a pre-processor and a self-organizing neural 
network. By using the MIT-BIH electrocardiogram database, 
the proposed neural network system can be trained to create 
the waveforms of cardiac diseases and to recognize the ECG 
waveforms. Also, a novel R point detection method is presented. 
The exercise ECG signals including 3,614 R points are tested. 
The proposed R point detection result reaches sensitivity being 
99.94%. The self-organizing neural network system was tested 
using the MIT-BIH ECG database. 18 data for each with five 
hours durations were segmented to many beat samples. 5 ECG 
models (without noise) were created. The results of normal and 
premature ventricular contraction (PVC) samples classifying 
using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database were obtained. We 
separated the samples into normal and abnormal signals by 15 
trained normal models, then we classified the abnormal ones by 
44 trained PVC models. The overall accuracy of the 
classification results is higher than 87%. 
 
Heart is one of the most important organs in human body. 
It uses the blood to transport nutrient to each organ, and 
removes the useless product from human body to balance 
each elements. The heart is the main center of blood stream, 
and the electrocardiogram (ECG) is the best indication to 
observe the cardiac activity. The heart diseases along with 
different ages and habits are diverse, and the disease 
symptoms and the conditions are also different. Therefore, it 
is desirable to realize the human health conditions by reading 
the outcomes of ECG and find out the disease of either 
arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or others. It has been 
shown that 90 to 95 percents of patients with acute 
myocardial infarction have some associated cardiac 
arrhythmia. Two most common cardiac arrhythmias during 
an acute myocardial infarction are premature ventricular 
contractions and sinus tachycardia. The analysis of the 
electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is the most readily available 
method for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias [1]. New 
techniques of arrhythmia detection using morphology of the 
waveform have shown promising results in correctly 
detecting fatal arrhythmias [2-3]. The purpose of this study 
is to present a self-organizing neural network system to

incoming sample X and an existed model Y. Xi and Yi are the 
ith signal in the sample X and model Y, respectively. Xmean 
and Ymean are the mean values of the sample X and model Y, 
respectively. 
 
C. Sample definition 
In this research, the input sample is defined as an R-R 
segment. We segment the signal from R point to next 
consecutive R point. We then resample all the R-R-segment 
samples to 250 point to make sure that the samples have the 
same fixed length. The sample definition of an R-R segment 
is shown in Fig. 2. 
 
Fig. 2. A sample with a 250-point fixed length 
 
C. A novel R point detection algorithm 
 
According to the result of earlier research, the accuracy 
of classifying the lead II R point detection in rest position 
was over 90% using the “So and Chan” method [8]. 
However, the accuracy of classifying the exercise ECG 
became lower than 70% by using that method. Therefore, it 
is inevitable to design a novel detection method in order to 
segment the ECG signal accurately in real-time. Due to the 
ECG signal is a time series signal, we are able to make use 
of the previous QRS segment and predict the following ones. 
Our proposed novel R point detection algorithm is described 
as follows. 
1. Initialization. 
X(n) is incoming ECG series, and the Xn is nth point of the 
ECG series. Ri is the location index of the ith R point. Sri is 
the estimate length of ith RR interval. RRi is the actual length 
of ith RR interval. c is the weighted constant. Assume that 
SR1 is the scan rate, in our case is 250. At the very beginning 
250 points, we can find the first QRS segment and R point 
location, say R1, by the following equation.  
R1  = argmax[X(n)],   
2. Iteration 
The QRS segment usually appears to be close to 
periodicity, that is, (i+1th) R point should be located nearby 
the duration within the range of Ri+SRi. The range to search 
the R point can therefore be set by the following equation. 
   
           
 
As one knows that the heart rate may fluctuate due to 
exercise or emotion, the estimate of RR interval, i.e., SRi+1, 
should be adjusted based on the average value of previous k 
RR intervals. The following equation show how the SRi is 
modified. 
 
                                       
3. Validation 
The slope examination method similar to the one 
proposed by So and Chan [10] is applied to validate our 
proposed R point detection algorithm to avoid misjudging 
between R and T point. Let Sn be the nth slope in the series 
X(n). a is a weighted constant. Sn is defined as follows. 
    (5) 
At most cases, the slope at R point is much higher than 
that at T point. Therefore, if the slope value detected is

a very low frequency drift. Due to the signal drifting, the 
correlations between the segmented samples become lower. 
Therefore, the neural network creates more models than the 
others recorded signals.  
Database: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database 
Testing object: Normal / PVC ECG 
Testing signal channel: MLII / 5min. data 
 
After using the neural network to classify the samples 
into models, we test the classification results and count the 
accuracy rate by the following steps. The testing block 
diagram is shown in Fig. 3.

$Correct classification% = (1-(failure classification number/ actual record 
number))x100% 
Fig. 3. Block diagram of testing processes  
 The normal ECG samples in each record are almost the 
same. Therefore, we can easily identify the normal ECG 
samples by the normal models, and then we indentify the 
fewer remain samples by abnormal models. We can make 
the classification more efficient by increasing the correct 
classification rate. The table above shows that the correct 
classification rates in most cases are higher than 80%. And 
the average correct classification rate is over 87%. The 
self-organizing neural network system presented in this 
study can classify many samples into a few normal/abnormal 
models effectively and correctly. 
 
At our experiment, we obtain 15 normal models and 44 
typical PVC models. The correlation threshold is set to be 
0.9 to match the normal models with testing samples. We set 
the correction threshold to 0.75 to match the normal models 
with the remaining test samples. Then we can recognize the 
abnormal samples using lower correlation threshold with 
abnormal models, and filter out the samples can’t be 
recognized. 
Table 3 indicates the classification results of signals in 
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. We select the database to be 
the testing objects because the PVC waveforms usually 
appear in arrhythmia ECG waveforms.

Abstract
The cerebral autoregulation (CA) mechanism
refers to the cerebral blood flow (CBF) tendency to
maintain relatively constant in the brain. In this
study, the time-domain analysis was applied to
evaluate the values of blood pressure and cerebral
blood flow velocity (CBFV) signals acquiring from
healthy subjects and diabetics with autonomic
neuropathy both in supine and head-up tilt positions.
Besides, the maximum cross-correlation function
(CCF) value with different thresholds was utilized to
assess CA mechanism. Time domain results revealed
that the values of mean arterial blood pressure
(MABP) and diastolic pressure were significantly
different (p ＜ 0.05) between supine and tilting
positions. However, it didn’t change obviously in 
cerebral blood flow velocity and it might show that
the CA mechanism remains relatively workable in
diabetics. On the other hand, the results of maximum
CCF values with different thresholds showed that
the qualified percent decreased with severity of
diabetic autonomic neuropathy. The values of
percent between healthy subjects and diabetics with
different severity of autonomic neuropathy were
significantly different (p＜0.05). It indicated that the
CA mechanisms in healthy subjects showed higher
correlation between blood pressure and cerebral
blood flow than that in diabetics. Therefore, the
maximum CCF with different thresholds can be a
useful approach to evaluate cerebral autoregulation
in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy.

二、緣由與目的
衛生署 2008 年統計資料公佈，糖尿病與腦血
管疾病分別是台灣地區國人十大死因的第四位及
第二位。近十年來，糖尿病與腦血管疾病更是在
十大死因的排行榜中居高不下，而糖尿病又是引
起腦血管疾病發生的重要危險因子[1]，因此糖尿
病的診療可說是臨床醫學上極待進ㄧ步突破的一
環。糖尿病患者由於體內的胰島素分泌或利用異
常，體內新陳代謝紊亂而使神經組織缺乏足夠的
氧氣因而造成神經系統的病變，導致隨之產生的
動脈硬化和高血壓等危險因素造成腦血管疾病的
發生，所以糖尿病與腦血管疾病的關係可說是相
當密切[2-3]。然而，以目前的醫學診療技術並無
法完全治癒糖尿病，因此更須重視糖尿病患者產
生腦血管病變的預防。此外，糖尿病所引發的許
多併發症又與神經病變有著相當密切的關係[4]，
但糖尿病患者神經系統開始異常時，往往毫無症
狀可循，且糖尿病患者本身也很難察覺而使病情

果，表 2為正常人及糖尿病患血壓時域(搖起/平躺)
分析結果，結果顯示正常人與無神經病變之糖尿
病患者，搖起時血壓皆會增加(比值＞1)，而輕微
自律神經病變與嚴重自律神經病變之糖尿病患
者，搖起時血壓則是不變或降低(平均比值≦1)，
統計結果則顯示正常人與無自律神經病變之糖尿
病患者相對於嚴重自律神經病變之糖尿病患者在
收縮血壓與平均血壓，其搖起與平躺比值上均有
統計上之意義(p＜0.05)，可知自律神經病變確實

糖尿病有嚴重神經病變患者相對於正常人對於腦
血流速相較無法維持恆定，顯示腦血流調控作用

Abstract—Baroreflex is a rapid response system in human 
body for dealing with the changes in blood pressure. Systolic 
arterial blood pressure (SABP) and mean heart rate (MHR) 
were analyzed by cross-correlation function (CCF) in diabetics 
with autonomic neuropathy to evaluate baroreflex. 60 diabet-
ics were separated into 3 groups by different severity of auto-
nomic neuropathy (AN). The control group was 10 age-
matched healthy subjects. SABP and MHR were acquired 
during both supine and head-up tilt positions. Average max 
CCF value of healthy subjects was significantly higher (p<0.05) 
than those in diabetic groups. It indicated that the correlation 
of SABP and MHR in diabetics was lower and it might reveal 
SABP and MHR in diabetics cannot be controlled as well as 
that in healthy subjects by the function of baroreflex. Besides, 
max CCF index values (phase difference) in diabetics were 
significantly lower (p<0.05) than that in healthy subjects. 
Lower phase difference in diabetics revealed the change of 
SABP almost caused the change of MHR simultaneously. It 
might indicate baroreflex cannot buffer the change of blood 
pressure and heart rate. Standard deviation of max CCF value 
in healthy subjects was significantly lower (p<0.05) than that 
in diabetic with severe autonomic neuropathy. It revealed 
variation of SABP and MHR was higher in diabetic with se-
vere AN. It could indicate the fluctuations of blood pressure 
and heart rate were higher with less functioning of baroreflex. 
According to the results, diabetic autonomic neuropathy ex-
erted an influence on baroreflex in diabetics. Therefore, blood 
pressure and heart rate cannot be maintained by the function 
of baroreflex. It might cause blood flow decreasing or increas-
ing in the blood vessels and bring kinds of health  
complications. In conclusion, cross-correlation function can be 
useful to assess baroreflex and severity of diabetic autonomic 
neuropathy. 
Keywords—Baroreflex, cross-correlation function, diabetic 
autonomic neuropathy. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
According to the definition of diabetes mellitus by WHO, 
diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease which occurs 
when the body does not produce enough insulin or cannot 
effectively use the insulin. Insulin is a hormone which 
regulates blood sugar. A common effect of uncontrolled 
diabetes is raising blood sugar (hyperglycaemia), and it 
could lead to damage in many systems in human body, 
especially the nerves and blood vessels. In addition, 
diabetes mellitus may cause serious health complications 
including renal failure, heart disease, stroke, and blindness. 
Some physiological mechanisms in human body are to 
sense and control changes of blood pressure.  One of the 
mechanisms is baroreflex. Baroreflex refers to the system 
with rapid response for dealing with the change in blood 
pressure. Patients with baroreflex failure may present 
hypertension, pheochromocytoma and damage to the 
glossopharyngeal or vagal nerves. Cross-correlation 
function (CCF) has been applied by previous investigators 
as a means to assess cerebral autoregulation [1-5]. 
Moreover, cross-correlation analysis of blood pressure and 
heart rate variability has been applied to investigate the 
relationship between pulse interval and systolic arterial 
blood pressure [6]. Previous studies showed that CCF 
would be a useful tool to assess cerebral autoregulation. In 
this study, arterial blood pressure and heart rate signals were 
acquired during both supine and head-up tilt positions and 
bandpass-filtered in the low frequency range (0.07-0.15 Hz) 
before applying cross-correlation function analysis. The 
main purpose of this research is to assess baroreflex by 
using cross-correlation analysis of mean heart rate and 
systolic arterial blood pressure in healthy subjects, diabetics 
without autonomic neuropathy (AN),  diabetic with mild 
AN and diabetics with severe AN. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Subjects and Measurements 
60 patients with diabetes were studied. 16 diabetics with-
out autonomic neuropathy (55.63±15.49 years), 25 diabetics 
had mild autonomic neuropathy (67.52±8.79 years) and 19 
diabetics were diagnosed with severe autonomic neuropathy 
(65.87±11.11 years). The diabetics took one or two oral 
hypoglycemic drugs such as Sulfonylureas and Metformin. 
Proceeding from a consensus conference in 1992 recom-
mended that three tests (R-R variation, Valsalva maneuver, 
and postural blood pressure testing) could be used for

The CCF result of one sample in the healthy group was 
drawn in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) shows the correlation among 
CCF(k), CCF index and time index. 3D representative 
figures showed the results of CCF(k) in each beat and all of 
the 2D representative figures give the mean and standard 
deviation of the CCF for the representative subjects. Fig. 
1(b) shows the max CCF value, max CCF time index and 
corresponding time lag. Similarly, Fig. 2 presents the result 
of one sample in diabetic groups. According to previous 
research, the CCF peak in negative time index is a result of 
the phase-lead property. The increasing time lag could

observed in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 2(b), the mean CCF(k) curve 
(with the symbols ×) in the healthy subject is more smooth 
than that in the diabetic. The standard deviation curve (with 
the symbol ■) is also smooth in the healthy subjects. It may 
reveal that correlation between blood pressure and heart rate 
is more stable in healthy subjects. On the other hand, 
baroreflex might be affected by autonomic neuropathy in 
diabetics make the correlation between blood pressure and 
heart rate unstable. That also indicates baroreflex in healthy 
subjects is more sensitive than that in diabetics. According 
to the representative of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, it may show the 
difference of baroreflex between healthy subjects and 
diabetics with autonomic neuropathy.

Recent investigations have shown that the autoregulatory dynamic response can be identified from 
spontaneous fluctuations in MABP and CBFV [4]. Recently, time domain cross-correlation function 
(CCF) has been used as a method to characterize the dynamics of CA [5]. Previously, in studying 
cerebral autoregulation time domain behaviors [6], we have observed that [7] diabetic patients with 
autonomic neuropathy often exhibit distinct time domain CA patterns compared to normal patients.  
Motivated by this preliminary observation, in this study, we investigate the feasibility of using the 
cross correlation between MABP and MCBFV as a signature to distinguish diabetic patients with 
varying degrees of autonomic neuropathy.  
2. Materials and Methods 
2.1 Subjects and measurements 
Four groups of subjects were recruited in this study including 14 healthy adults (group 1, 4 men, 10 
women) with a mean age of 30.3±8 years, 15 diabetics without autonomic neuropathy (group 2, 10 men, 
5 women) with a mean age of 52.5±16.27 years, 25 diabetics with mild autonomic neuropathy (group 3, 
15 men, 10 women) with a mean age of 67.5±8.8 years, and 18 diabetics with severe autonomic 
neuropathy (group 4, 12 men, 6 women) with a mean age of 61.6±10.9 years. The subjects in healthy 
group were included only if they had no history of vascular disease, heart problems, hypertension, 
migraine, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm, intra-cerebral bleeding or other pre-existing neurological 
conditions. None of the subjects were receiving any medication during the time of the study. CBFV was 
measured in the right middle cerebral artery using TCD (Transcranial Doppler ultrasound, EME TC2020) 
in conjunction with a 5-MHz transducer fixed over the temporal bones by an elastic headband. 
Continuous ABP recordings were obtained through the Finapres (Ohmeda 2300) device with the cuff 
attached to the middle finger of the right hand. Data acquisition was started after a 10-min relaxation in 
supine position. Spontaneous ABP and CBFV were recorded simultaneously to PC for off-line analysis. 
The acquisition periods were approximately 5 minutes in the supine position. The personal computer 
combined with a general-purpose data acquisition board and LabVIEW environment for acquiring 
signals correctly was developed in our previous study [8]. The sampling rate to acquire the analog data 
from TCD and Finapres was adjustable in this system. In our experiments, the sampling rate is set to 60 
Hz. 
2.2 Preprocessing and feature extraction 
The Finapres device was fully automated. The blood volume under an inflatable finger cuff was 
measured with an infrared plethysmograph, and kept constant to a set point value by controlling the cuff 
pressure in response to volume changes in the finger artery. By means of a built-in servo adjustment 
mechanism, a proper volume-clamped set point was established and adjusted at regular intervals. 
However, this procedure interrupted the blood pressure recording (usually for 2-3 beats every 70 beats). 
We called the artifacts caused by the regular servo adjustment in the continuously acquired pulse signal 
“servo components”. Because both ABP and CBFV signals were acquired, displayed, and stored into a 
PC simultaneously. The direct removal of servo artifacts from the ABP was not appropriate because it

3. Results and Discussion 
Cross-correlation analysis was applied to characterize the linearity and the phase relationship 
between MABP and MCBFV. The peak MABP-MCBFV CCF values indicate significant relationships 
between these variables. Usually, the mean CCF values are not significant without distinctive peaks in 
the VLF range. However, significant peaks could be obtained in both the LF and HF ranges. Principal 
component analysis was applied to reduce the feature dimensions in order to obtain the visual 
observation of the spread of data,. A 2D scatter plot of these 72 subjects using only two principal 
components is shown in Figure 1. It has shown the applicability of using SVM classifier to classify those 
four groups of subjects. 
 
Figure 1. 2D scatter plot of these 72 subjects using only two dimensions of principal components. “o” 
stands for the subject in group 1, “x” for group 2, “+” for group 3, “*” for group 4. 
Generally, larger mean peak CCF values and lower standard deviations of peak CCF values existed 
for most of normal subjects in comparison to that for diabetics without autonomic neuropathy and 
diabetics with mild and severe autonomic neuropathy. Furthermore, the values of standard deviations of 
peak CCFs in VLF range were usually larger than that in LF and HF ranges. The phase shift analysis 
between MABP and MCBFV demonstrated a test of dynamic autoregulation [6]. The negative lag of the 
CCF peak between MABP and MCBFV is a result of the phase-lead property and it also indicates that 
CA is a highpass filter. The increasing time lag of the CCF peak might be a good evidence to show the 
disturbance of autoregulatory effect. The cross-correlation analysis indicated that the MCBFV usually 
preceded MABP in most subjects. However, the standard deviations of the corresponding time lags of 
the peak CCF values in three diabetics groups are larger than that in the normal group. Note that if the 
time lags between MABP and MCBFV are closer to the origin, it may imply that CA is less efficient. In

analysis has been utilized by previous investigators as a means 
to characterize dynamic CA [14-17]. CCF analysis was applied 
successfully to assess and quantify CA between healthy 
subjects and diabetics showing that CCF could be a useful tool 
in assessing CA [18,19]. Melenovasky et al. adopted two 
different hypolipidemic drugs to compare the effects in patients 
with hyperlipidemia. Their result showed that the difference 
between the effects of both drugs was found only for blood 
lipids [20]. Kanaya et al. compared the differential heart rate 
variability effects of two drugs, Propofol and Sevoflurane. 
Results indicated that Sevoflurane has little or no effect on the 
cardiac parasympathetic tone [21].  
In this study, the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) 
and mean cerebral blood flow velocity (MCBFV) signals were 
acquired during both supine and head-up tilt positions before 
and after two months of antihypertension treatment. The main 
purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 
antihypertensive therapy on CA using spectral and CCF 
analyses and develop treatment guidelines for patients with 
hypertension. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1 Subjects and measurements 
Two antihypertensive drugs, Cozaar and Renitec, were 
used to investigate the effects on the correlation between 
MABP and MCBFV after 2 months of treatments. Seventeen 
hypertensive outpatients from the Neurology Section of 
Cheng-Ching General Hospital were enrolled and separated 
randomly into two groups. One group with 9 subjects received 
Cozaar treatment (age: mean ± SD = 50.11 ± 10.30 years), 
another group with 8 subjects received Renitec treatment (age: 
mean ± SD = 50.75 ± 14.37 years). Another group was 
recruited with nine age-matched healthy subjects. Informed 
consent was received from all subjects prior to entry into the 
study. This study was approved by the Research Ethics 
Committee of Cheng-Ching General Hospital. Hypertension 
was defined as a clinic blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg 
(WHO/ISH Guidelines 2000). Continuous ABP signals were 
acquired via Finapres (Model 2300, Ohemda, Englewood, CO, 
USA). CBFV signals were obtained through TCD (transcranial 
Doppler ultrasound, EME TC2020, Nicolet Instrument, 
Warwick, UK). Subjects were examined on a tilt-table that 
enabled a motor-driven change from a supine to an upright 
position at 75° within 4 seconds. Data acquisition was started 
after a 10-min relaxation period in the supine position. 
Simultaneously, MABP and MCBFV signals were acquired 
during both supine and 75° head-up tilt positions before and 
after two months of treatment. The personal computer 
combined with a general-purpose data acquisition board and 
LabVIEW 6i environment for acquiring signals correctly was 
developed in our previous study [18,19]. 
2.2 Data analysis 
The MABP value was calculated for each heart beat as

where ABP(‧) is the arterial blood pressure pulse signal 
continuously acquired from Finapres. Pi is the wave-through 
time index in the ith pulse beat. Therefore, MABPi is the 
calculated mean ABP value for the ith pulse beat. 
Representation of the ABP signal is drawn as Fig. 1. 
 
Figure 1. Representation of the ABP signal. 
 
Similarly, the mean CBFV can be derived from Eq. (2).

from the TCD. Fi is the time index of the wave-through in the 
CBFV signal corresponding to the ith pulse beat. MCBFVi is 
the mean value of CBFV for the ith pulse beat. 
The signals gathered were processed before being applied 
for analysis. In the beginning, the sampling rate to acquire the 
analog data of CBFV and ABP from TCD and Finapres was set 
to 60 Hz. The wave-peak and wave-valley of each cardiac cycle 
could be marked from the ABP and CBFV signals using the 
approach proposed in a previous study [22]. The length of 
signals was set to 256. Afterward, the MABP and MCBFV time 
series calculated by Eqs. (1) and (2). MABP and MCBFV were 
estimated by each heart beat in time series, with the unit being 
time index. The sampling time was set equal to the mean heart 
period of each subject. Therefore, the result would not be 
biased. 
2.3 Power spectral density analysis 
Spectral analysis can be used to explore the specific 
autonomic nervous system activity. MABP and MCBFV signals 
were bandpass filtered in the low frequency range (0.04-0.15 Hz) 
and high frequency range (0.15-0.40 Hz). The ratio of low- to 
high-frequency power (L/H) was calculated as an index of 
sympathetic-vagal activity. 
Power spectral density is calculated as follows. A 
discrete-time signal x(n), the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) 
analysis relationship is:

2.5 Statistical analysis 
All results were presented as mean ± SD. Student’s t test was 
used to determine the significance of difference between supine 
and head-up tilt data which were normally distributed. The 
nonparametric test was performed to test the difference between 
healthy and hypertensive subjects. All statistical analyses were 
performed using SPSS 9.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and 
the statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. 
3. Results 
The ABP and CBFV time series signals were acquired 
through Finapres and TCD, respectively. The mean values, 
MABP and MCBFV, were derived from Eqs. (1) and (2). Both 
MABP and MCBFV recordings were obtained using 256 heart 
beats from each subject. The spectral and CCF analyses results 
were observed in the LF and HF ranges. CCF was estimated 
using a 64-beat-wide moving window. Because the total 
number of cardiac cycles for both MABP and MCBFV to 
compute the CCF was 256 beats, as shown in Eq. (7), the 
number of CCF included for each subject was 193. 
In time domain, MABP values in the group with Cozaar 
were reduced significantly after two months of treatment in both 
supine and head-up tilt positions (p < 0.05). However, there was 
no significant reduction in the group with Renitec after 2 months 
of treatment. Although MABP were reduced in both 
hypertensive groups, Cozzar seemed to have more manifest 
effect on lowering blood pressure than that of Renitec. However, 
the MCBFV values demonstrated no significant difference after 
two months of treatment in the two groups (Tables 1 and 2).

In the spectral analysis, the ratio of low- to high-frequency 
power (L/H, an index of sympathetic-vagal activity) tends to 
increase in the Renitec group compared to the Cozaar group in 
MABP and MCBFV after two months’ treatment in supine 
position (Tables 3 and 4). However, it did not show significant 
difference (p > 0.05). The spectral analysis results from one 
subject in the Cozaar group are shown in Fig. 3. It can be 
observed that the power in LF decreased in both the supine and 
head-up tilt positions after two months treatment. However, no 
significant change in the HF range was found after treatment in 
both the supine and head-up tilt positions.

Tables 5, 6 and 7 reveal the CCF results from healthy 
subjects, Cozaar and Renitec groups, respectively, in the 
low-frequency bandwidth. In the Cozaar group, the max CCF 
value increased and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the max 
CCF value decreased in the tilt position after two months of 
treatment, which were significantly different after treatment 
(p < 0.05). Moreover, the CV of the max CCF values was 
significantly different between the supine and head-up tilt 
positions after two months of treatment (p < 0.05). This might 
indicate that the correlation between MABP and MCBFV was 
improved after the Cozaar treatment. The max CCF index value 
in the Renitec group increased and became significantly 
different (p < 0.05) in the supine position after two months of 
treatment. According to previous research, the CCF peak in the 
negative time index is a result of the phase-lead property. The 
increasing time lag represents evidence of cerebral 
autoregulation disturbance [18,19]. Therefore, this might 
indicate that the cerebral autoregulation disturbance function 
was better after treatment.  
In the Renitec group, the max CCF time and CCF time 
index values were significantly different (p < 0.05) from those 
in the healthy group before treatment. In the Cozaar group, the 
max CCF values were significantly different (p < 0.05) from 
those in the healthy group before treatment. However, max

CCF time, time index and values for Cozaar and Renitec 
groups tend to those for healthy group subjects in tilt position 
after two months of treatment. This might indicate that patients 
with hypertension will exhibit the relationship between blood 
pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity trend toward those in 
healthy subjects after treatment with these two antihypertensive 
drugs, Cozaar and Renitec. 
Tables 8, 9 and 10 reveal the CCF results for healthy 
subjects, Cozaar and Renitec groups in the high-frequency 
bandwidth. These results did not show significance in HF 
changes after two months of treatment for these two groups. 
Also, the CCF results for the healthy group did not show a 
significant difference from the Cozaar and Renitec groups. 
Hence, the CCF results were not manifested in HF and agreed 
with the result from the previous study [18]. Figures 4, 5, and 6 
show the CCF result comparison for patients and healthy 
subjects in the LF range. After treatment with Cozaar or 
Renitec, the CCF analysis results changed (or varied) in the 
direction of the values in healthy subjects in tilt position, and 
the difference of the results in tilt position between healthy 
persons and patients was not significant (p > 0.05). 
4. Discussion 
In spectral analysis results, the mean value of L/H, which 
reflects the sympathetic tone [13], tended to increase in the 
Renitec group compared to that in the Cozaar group in supine 
position. Although it did not show significant difference 
(p > 0.05) between Cozaar and Renitec groups, it revealed that 
the value of L/H tends to decrease after Cozaar treatments. 
According to this physiological response, people will have 
higher blood pressure when their sympathetic nerves are more 
active. Thus, we speculate that Cozaar might lower blood 
pressure more because of superior sympathetic nervous system 
suppression activity. 
The MABP and MCBFV signals were bandpass-filtered 
before applying CCF analyses for studying the antihypertensive 
drug effects at different bandwidths. The CCF analysis results 
revealed that the max CCF values in the HF range was lower 
than those in the LF range. This indicates that the correlation 
between MABP and MCBFV would be more obvious in the LF 
range. According to previous research, the left-shift (negative 
lag) of the CCF peak between MABP and MCBFV is a result 
of the phase-lead property. The increasing time lag of the CCF 
peak might be evidence of auto-regulatory disturbance. As the 
CCF HF results shown in Tables 8, 9 and 10, the max CCF 
time values in the HF range were closer to zero than those in 
the LF range. It may be inferred that CA is less efficient in the 
HF range. Hence, it is helpful to filter the MABP and MCBFV 
signals before utilizing them in CCF analysis. The CV of the 
max CCF value in the LF range decreased significantly 
(p < 0.05) during tilt position in both the Cozaar and Renitec 
groups. Because CV represents a relative dispersion 
measurement, the lower values in response to tilting may reveal

5. Conclusion 
These two antihypertensive drugs, Cozaar and Renitec, 
improved cerebral autoregulation functions in patients, 
according to the CCF analysis results. The only difference 
between these two drugs was their effect in decreasing blood 
pressure, according to the time domain and spectral analysis 
results. For this reason, which drug should be adopted to lower 
the blood pressure depends on the patient’s blood pressure 
condition in the first few days. Further studies are needed to 
assess the clinical significance of cardiovascular regulation in 
patients with hypertensive diseases.

acquired non-invasively using a finger cuff device (Finapres BP monitor). A high-
speed servo system in the Finapres inflates and deflates the cuff rapidly to maintain the 
photoplethysmographic output constant at the unloaded state. CA is more a concept 
rather than a physically measurable entity [4]. Noninvasive CA assessment has been 
developed and studied using either static or dynamic methods [5]. It is a challenge to 
find appropriate methods to assess CA non-invasively and reliably using simple and 
acceptable procedures. Recent investigations have shown that the autoregulatory 
dynamic response can be identified from spontaneous fluctuations in MABP and 
CBFV [6]. Some investigators assessed the dynamic relationship between spontaneous 
MABP and CBFV using transfer function analysis in either normal subjects [7][8] or in 
autonomic failure patients [9]. Some investigators used spontaneous blood pressure 
changes as input signals to test CA [10][11]. Spectral and transfer function analyses of 
CBFV and ABP were performed using fast Fourier transform (FFT) in their 
experiments. However, the stationary property and time resolution are two critical 
problems for spectral analysis. Another study was made to explore spontaneous beat-
to-beat fluctuations in MABP and breath-by-breath variability in end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) 
in continuous recordings obtained from normal subjects at rest to estimate the dynamic 
influences of arterial blood pressure and CO2 on CBFV [12]. 
Time domain cross-correlation function (CCF) has been recently used by previous 
investigators as a method to characterize the dynamics of CA [13-15]. Previously, in 
studying cerebral autoregulation time domain behaviors [16], we have observed that 
diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy often exhibit distinct time domain CA 
patterns compared to normal patients. Also, linear features extracted from CCFs and 
using support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier achieved 87.5% of classification 
rate in classifying normal subjects and three groups of diabetic patients with varying 
degrees of autonomic neuropathy [17]. 
The chaotic analysis will be implemented to assess dynamic CA in diabetics by a 
nonlinear measure, correlation dimension (CD) in this study. CD focuses on the 
system’s complexity. By using the parameters of chaotic analysis to quantify CA, we 
expect normal autoregulation system would tend to lower chaos and higher regular, 
predictable behavior of the system to initial conditions, but impaired autoregulation 
would be more chaotic and less predictable in terms of chaotic analysis. Motivated by 
preliminary observations, we investigate the feasibility of using the both linear CCF 
features and nonlinear CD feature of MABP and MCBFV as a signature to distinguish 
diabetic patients with varying degrees of autonomic neuropathy.

2.3   Cross-Correlation Function 
Before calculating the CCF between the MABP and MCBFV time series, the 
MABP and MCBFV were normalized using their mean values. Assume that the 
normalized MABP and MCBFV time series are and  
respectively. and  signals were then bandpass filtered in the very low-
frequency range (VLF, 0.015-0.07 Hz), low-frequency range (LF, 0.07-0.15 Hz) and 
high-frequency range (HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz) before applying the CCF. A third-order 
digital bandpass Chebyshev filter provided in the LabVIEW signal analysis functions 
was applied. The sampling period of the filter was set equal to the mean heart period 
of each subject. The low cutoff frequency and high cutoff frequency were assigned at 
the beginning and ending passband frequencies at each bandpass frequency range of 
interest. The passband ripple error of each bandpass Chebyshev filter was limited to 1 
dB. Assume that the bandpass filtered  and  time series are  and

extracted from MCBFV in LF range is used in this study. 
2.5   Support Vector Machine 
Support vector machine (SVM) is a very useful technique for pattern 
classification. The goal of SVM is to produce a model which predicts the class labels 
of patterns in the testing set which are given only the features. The training patterns 
are mapped into a higher dimensional space and SVM finds a linear separating 
hyperplane with the maximal margin in this higher dimensional space to classify 
different groups [22]. Assumed that the training patterns are linearly separable, and 
given the training data S as follows. 
 
{ } }1,1{,,,2,1,,),(,),,( 11 −+∈=∈= inill yliRxyxyxS LL

Where stands for the ith training pattern, stands for the class label of the ith 
training pattern, l  denotes the total number of the training data, and n  denotes the 
dimensions of the feature spaces. Sometimes, the training data may not be completely 
separable by a hyperplane. The slack variables, denoted by
ix iy
ξ , lii ,,3,2,1,0 L≥ =ξ , can 
be introduced to relax the constraints and C > 0 is the penalty parameter of the error. 
Therefore, the SVM require the solution of the following optimization problem as 
follows.

The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the classification results for each group 
of subjects using the SVM classifier are listed in Table 3. The results indicate that our 
method could discriminate among normal, diabetics without autonomic neuropathy, 
diabetics with mild autonomic neuropathy, and diabetics with severe autonomic 
neuropathy with an average sensitivity of 92.2%, an average specificity of 97.1%, and 
an average accuracy of 95.8%. 
4   Conclusion 
This study focused on using both the linear cross-correlation function features and 
nonlinear correlation dimension feature to assess the effects of changes on MABP and 
MCBFV without any special maneuvers needed for the measurement. The MABP and 
MCBFV signals were bandpass filtered before applying linear and nonlinear analyses

Abstract. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using the linear cross-
correlation function (CCF) and nonlinear correlation dimension (CD) features 
of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and mean cerebral blood flow velocity 
(MCBFV) as a signature to classify diabetics with various degrees of autonomic 
neuropathy. 72 subjects were recruited. For each subject, continuous CBFV was 
measured using a Transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and continuous ABP 
recorded using a Finapres device in supine position. The CCFs and CDs of pre-
filtered spontaneous MABP and MCBFV were computed. Twelve CCF features 
and one CD feature were extracted from three frequency ranges: very low 
frequency (VLF, 0.015-0.07Hz), low frequency (LF, 0.07-0.15 Hz), and high 
frequency (HF, 0.15-0.40Hz). The feature vectors are classified using a support 
vector machine (SVM) classifier; and a classification rate of 91.67% is obtained 
under the leave-one-out cross validation evaluation scheme. This very 
encouraging result indicates that the proposed linear and nonlinear features 
between MABP and MCBFV can be effective features to discriminate diabetic 
patients with autonomic neuropathy.

1   Introduction 
The cerebral autoregulation (CA) mechanism refers to the cerebral blood flow 
(CBF) tendency to maintain relatively constant in the brain despite changes in mean 
arterial blood pressure (MABP) in the interval from 50-170 mmHg [1]. A technique 
using a transcranial Doppler (TCD) was introduced to evaluate the dynamic response 
of CA in humans [2]. Rapid drops in arterial blood pressure (ABP) caused by the 
release of thigh blood pressure cuffs were used as an autoregulatory stimulus. The 
ABP and CBF velocity (CBFV) were compared during the autoregulatory process. 
Some investigators using the same paradigm [3] validated this approach. They 
demonstrated that the relative changes in CBFV had an extremely close correlation 
reflecting relative changes in CBF during autoregulation testing. ABP can also be 
migraine, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm, intra-cerebral bleeding or other pre-existing 
neurological conditions. None of the subjects were receiving any medication during 
the time of the study. Here we describe abnormalities in autonomic functions 
determined using Low’s non-invasive techniques for the assessment of autonomic 
functions [18, 19] with minor modification by replacing the sudomotor examination 
with the sympathetic skin response (SSR) test. Low’s criteria incorporated a 
composite score (maximum score 10) that gives an overall indication of the severity 
of autonomic abnormalities [19]. Three components that make up the composite score 
are, the adrenergic index (AI, an indicator of sympathetic function) maximum score 4, 
the cardiovascular heart rate index (CVHRI, indicator of parasympathetic function) 
maximum score 3, and the sudomotor index, maximum score 3. In our study, the 
patient with composite score 0-3 is determined as without autonomic failure, 3-6 as 
mild autonomic failure, and 6-10 as severe autonomic failure. CBFV was measured in 
the right middle cerebral artery using TCD (transcranial Doppler ultrasound, EME 
TC2020) in conjunction with a 5-MHz transducer fixed over the temporal bones using 
an elastic headband. Continuous ABP recordings were obtained through the Finapres 
(Ohmeda 2300) device with the cuff attached to the middle finger of the right hand. 
Data acquisition was started after a 10-min relaxation in supine position. Spontaneous 
ABP and CBFV were recorded simultaneously to a PC for off-line analysis. The 
acquisition periods were approximately 5 minutes in supine position using a custom-
developed data acquisition system. The personal computer combined with a general 
purpose data acquisition board and LabVIEW environment for acquiring signals 
correctly was developed in our previous study [20]. The sampling rate needed to 
acquire the analog data from TCD and Finapres is adjustable in this system. In our 
experiments, the sampling rate was set to 60 Hz. 
2.2   Preprocessing 
The Finapres device was fully automated. The blood volume under an inflatable 
finger cuff was measured with an infrared plethysmograph, and kept constant to a set 
point value by controlling the cuff pressure in response to volume changes in the 
finger artery. Using a built-in servo adjustment mechanism, a proper volume-clamped 
set point was established and adjusted at regular intervals. However, this procedure 
interrupted the blood pressure recording (usually for 2-3 beats every 70 beats). We 
called the artifacts caused by the regular servo adjustment in the continuously 
acquired pulse signal “servo components” because both ABP and CBFV signals were 
simultaneously acquired, displayed, and stored into a PC. The direct removal of servo 
artifacts from the ABP was not appropriate because it would result in different time 
duration in comparison with the CBFV signal. Therefore, a signal relaxation 
algorithm was presented [16] to compensate for the artifacts caused by the servo 
components.  
The mean ABP value was calculated for each heart beat as follows.

CCF  is the result of 
the CCF between  and  in the ith time window. Mean CCF patterns were 
obtained for each subject and for the entire population. In this study, the cross-
correlation functions (CCFs) were estimated using a 64 beat wide moving window. 
The total number of cardiac cycles for both MABP and MCBFV to compute the CCF 
was 256 beats. Thus, the total number of CCFs included for each subject was 193. As 
mentioned, the MABP and MCBFV signals were bandpass filtered in the VLF, LF, 
and HF ranges before extracting features from CCFs for the purpose of studying the 
effect of dynamic CA. A third-order digital bandpass Chebyshev filter was applied. 
The sampling period of the filter was set equal to the mean heart period of each 
subject. The low cutoff frequency and high cutoff frequency were assigned at the 
beginning and ending passband frequencies at each bandpass frequency range of 
interest. The passband ripple error of each bandpass Chebyshev filter was limited to 1 
dB. Only time lags of CCFs ranged between -10 and +5 with positive extreme values 
existed were taken into account to extract the features in order to eliminate the 
outliers of CCFs caused by artifacts in each frequency band. Afterward, the means 
and standard deviations of the valid CCFs in each frequency band and the means and 
standard deviations of their corresponding time lags were calculated as the features to 
represent each subject. There are 12 linear features extracted for each subject. 
2.4   Correlation Dimension 
The nonlinear parameter, correlation dimension (CD) [21], was calculated to 
evaluate the complexity of MABP and MCBFV. The signal was reconstructed from 
time series before measuring the chaos properties to determinate the complexity and 
regularity. A new coordinate system, phase space, was used to reconstruct an attractor. 
Phase space is an abstract mathematical space that can expresses the behavior of a 
dynamic system. In the phase space, the behavior of a dynamic system (trajectory or 
orbit) finally converges to the stationary state, called attractor. Due to the number of 
phase space coordinates cannot be calculated immediately from the time data, it is 
necessary to reconstruct the n-dimensional phase space from a signal record of time 
series measurement. The n-dimensional attractor can be reconstructed from one-
dimensional projected data of time series using embedding method. The n-
dimensional vector is constructed as follows.

3   Results and Discussion 
Cross-correlation analysis provides correlation and phase relationship between 
MABP and MCBFV. Results indicated that the correlation values for normal subjects 
are generally higher than that for diabetics without and with autonomic neuropathy 
[16]. The peak MABP-MCBFV CCF values indicate significant relationships between 
these variables. Usually, the mean CCF values are not significant without distinctive 
peaks in the VLF range. However, significant peaks could be obtained in both the LF 
and HF ranges [17]. Because CBF remains constant despite cerebral perfusion 
pressure changes, the region in this constant level is nonlinear. Some useful nonlinear 
information maybe missed and cannot be characterized by using linear analysis. 
Therefore, it might be beneficial to analyze CA using nonlinear methods. Chaos 
theorem, the nonlinear approach, has been applied to many physiological studies, 
such as heart rate variability (HRV), electroencephalograph (EEG), respiratory 
rhythm, speech recognition, blood pressure and cardiovascular system. They provided 
the chaotic nature in physiological systems. Nevertheless, nonlinear dynamic CA in 
diabetics dealt with chaotic analysis was still rarely discussed. Non-linear control 
mechanism is also essential to the control mechanism of CA. In this study, the 
correlation dimension analysis is applied. The correlation dimension analysis of 
MABP and MCBFV by taking the average value of 20 iterations of the dimension 
analysis is listed in Table 1. 
 
In diabetics with severe autonomic neuropathy, the CD values of the MCBFV 
did not differ significantly between supine and tilt-up positions. On the other hand, 
higher CD values with statistical significance of both MABP and MCBFV in normal 
subjects, and diabetics without and mild autonomic neuropathy in supine position 
compared to that in tilt-up position. Also note that all CD values in tilt-up position are 
less than that in supine position. 
 
The SVM software-LIBSVM developed by C.C. Chang and C.J. Lin [23] was 
adopted in our classification task. 13 features (i.e., 12 linear CCF features and one 
nonlinear CD feature) extracted from VLF, LF, and HF ranges obtained the best 
classification performance. There were two parameters while using RBF kernels: C 
and γ . The best ),( γC is set to be to obtain the best cross-validation rate. It 
made no significant difference whether we normalized the features or not. After 
applying these features to SVM and using leave-one-out cross validation to classify 
these four groups of 72 subjects, 91.67% of classification rate was achieved as shown 
in Table 2. 66 subjects out of 72 subjects could be classified correctly.

in studying the effect of different bandwidths. Means and standard deviations of the 
valid CCFs in each frequency band, the means and standard deviations of their 
corresponding time lags, and CD feature of MCBFV in LF range were calculated as 
features to represent each subject in only supine position. 91.67% of classification 
rate was achieved in classifying 4 groups of subjects after applying SVM classifier 
with leave-one-out cross validation. This study suggests that both linear and nonlinear 
features extracted from CCFs and CD respectively using SVM as the classifier 
outperforms our previous approach with only linear features used. Our method can be 
a noninvasive, simple, easy, and effective method to classify the dynamic cerebral 
autoregulation in diabetics with autonomic neuropathy. Our future work involves 
reproducing our findings in a larger population including patients that might show the 
absence or impairment of pressure autoregulation.
