6up and down. Therefore, this equipment has the self-running functions of vertical lifting and
horizontal moving, Chang et al.（2006）. It is an automated material handling equipment very
suitable for MSS.
The MSS possess many advantages, but very few study focus on it. The goal of this study is to
construct an MSS with automated storage/retrieval functions called mobile automated
storage/retrieval systems (M-AS/RS) that use IMCD so as to enhance the space utility rate and
operation efficiency of MSS. In this study, three models will be proposed. First, the M-AS/RS
establishes an automated one-sided picking model; that is, the stored goods can be picked on only
one side. Moreover, the IMCD run with right-angled path. Second, two-sided picking model was
proposed. In this model, we present a modification of the movement action of the IMCD from a
right-angled path to a straight-line path. In addition, this model proposes an assignment algorithm to
arrange improved picking aisles—thus reducing the number of aisles required for an IMCD
operation. Finaly, the ‘no-skip’ method developed by Goetschalckx and Ratlif (1988), which 
arranges the picking sequence inside the aisle, is integrated with the assignment algorithm and the
modified IMCD movement action to produce a M-AS/RS with a two-sided picking model.
The disadvantage of M-AS/RS is that if the adjacent sequential picking location could not be
picked in the same picking aisle, then tremendous equipment rows have to move in order to create a
new picking aisle for picker to run. The movement of huge equipment rows increases not only the
operation cost but also the risk of good damage. In the picking process, the picker has to take a long
distance to travel. Therefore, the third model is proposed and presents a modification of the cross
aisle layout of the warehouse from a front cross aisle to middle cross aisle layout. This model
modifies the aisle assignment algorithm proposed by two-sided model to arrange improved picking
aisles—thus reducing the movement distance for an IMCD run during picking operation.
This study is an innovative application to establish automated AS/RS model (M-AS/RS) for
MSS. Practically, the M-AS/RS can be applied when the frequency of storage and retrieval is low,
but high storage space is needed—especially in environments characterized by poor ventilation or
the movement of heavy products. Finally, this study makes some comparative analyses between
M-AS/RS and MSS models and addresses the advantages of the M-AS/RS model. The results can
provide a solution for industry to improve the disadvantages in the current MSS model.
2. Literature Review
The issue of AS/RS always plays important role in warehousing. There are many studies
enhancing the performance in different aspects. We survey and classify related studies into several
areas.
With the aids of information technology, Daniels et al.(1998) tracking the inventories with
computer that parts can be stored in multiple locations, simplifying replenishment of inventory and
eliminating the need to reserve space for each item. Lin and Lu (1999) proposed a computer-based
procedure to determine order-picking strategies and got significant effect on order picking. Several
researchers have also focused on the performance of order picking using man-on-board
storage-and-retrieval systems (Hwang and Song 1993; Lee 1992; van Oudheusden et al. 1988) or

there is one row of racks available for moving, J columns for every rack, and K layers in every
column. In order to make IMCD move freely, there must be a shared and changeable picking aisle
and a front aisle. The author assumes the width of the aisle equal to the width of unit rack (w), so
the total number of picking aisle equal to 1I . Therefore, racks move inside the warehousing center,
which needs to have the width, length and height as follows: (1) Width (W)＝Widthw of I units of
storage racks and width of one mobilized picking aisle ＝ (I＋1) × w. (2) Length (L)＝Length (l)
of J units of storage racks and width of one front aisle ＝  wlJ  . (3) Height (H)＝Height (h)of
K layers of units of storage racks＝ hK . Therefore, the total area required for the whole MSS is
     wlJwI 1 , and the total space required is W × L × H ＝
      hKwlJwI 1 . The IMCD adopts one-sided picking, meaning that IMCD
being at iA aisle picks the item at iR (during this time iR is on the 1iA aisle) and IMCD runs
in right-angle path. We also suppose that the size of fork is limited to the length, width and height
of a rack, meaning that as IMCD enters iA at the lowest position, it can just pick the item at 1L
and no lifting is required. Since the width of aisle is limited to the width of an IMCD, the number
of iA = 1I . With the above assumptions, we are going to explain the operation model in the
following section.

items of each order according to descending sequencing, IMCD starts picking. The following are
the detailed description on the picking model.
First of all, according to the coordinate numbers of storage place on racks, the computer
numbers the 8 items of order 1OS from large to small sizes based on the descending way. Since
Item 7 being stored on Row 9 is the biggest in size, it is numbered as Sequence 1. Item 1 being
stored on Row 7 is numbered as Sequence 2. Since Item 4 and Item 8 are stored on Row 6 at the
same time, the sequencing of these two items will be according to the moving distance of IMCD.
This research supposes that IMCD adopts right-angled marching. Thus, the maximum value of the
sum of column and layer is just the longest of IMCD. Comparing the storage places of Item 4 and
Item 8, it is found that the value of Item 4 is 3(2+1), which is bigger than the value of Item 8 being
2(1+1). Therefore, Sequence 3 is Item 4, and Sequence 4 is Item 8. Similarly, the value of Item 2
is 5, which is smaller than the value of Item 5 being 6. Therefore, Sequence 5 is Item 5, and
Sequence 6 is Item 2. Sequence 7 is Item 6 on Row 3, and Sequence 8 is Item 3 on Row 2. The
order 1OS is rearranged. The picking sequence of this order according to descending sequencing is

Under the status of mhlw 1 , and sec/2.0 mvvv cyx  , the total time for picking

5. Two-sided Picking Model (the second year)
A one-sided picking model is that the stored goods can be picked on only one side. If the
stored goods could be picked on both sides (a so-caled ‘co-picking aisle’), the number of aisles 
required for an IMCD run could be reduced. Moreover, the IMCD runs at right-angle to the current
M-AS/RS one-sided picking model. If the moving action of the IMCD in an M-AS/RS one-sided
picking model could be modified to a straight-line path, it would possess higher performance
capability.
This chapter presents a modification of the movement action of the IMCD from a right-angle
path to a straight-line path（Fig 5）. In addition, an assignment algorithm has been proposed to
arrange improved picking aisles—thus reducing the number of aisles required for an IMCD
operation. Finaly, the ‘no-skip’ method developed by Goetschalckx and Ratlif (1988), which 
arranges the picking sequence inside the aisle, is integrated with the assignment algorithm and the
modified IMCD movement action to produce a mobile automated storage/retrieval system
(M-AS/RS) with a two-sided picking model.

trip can be divided into three stages and the times needed for each stage are 1t , 2t , and 3t
respectively. In the following, the picking models and the calculation of 1t , 2t , and 3t are
described in detail.
Finally, Table 4 summarized the picking cycle movement elements including the movement of
the rack on M-AS/RS.
In order to apply IMCD on the automated item picking of MSS, we have to integrate
computer ordering system, equipment sensor and IMCD controller so as to make IMCD pick
products in MSS. This model also proposed a flowchart for the operation model of the whole
M-AS/RS. As shown in Figure 6.

5.3 Operation Algorithm
After the two-sided picking model with the IMCD running in a straight-line was proposed,
there are two procedures in the operation model. First, a picking-aisle-assignment algorithm is
required to decide the real picking aisle for IMCD so as to reduce the number of aisles for the
IMCD run. After deciding the picking aisle in which the IMCD will move, the second procedure is
to discover the shortest path in the picking aisle. The two algorithms can be described as follows.
Algorithm 1: Decide the sequence of real picking aisle for IMCD run.
Step 1. Decide the set of batch order of items  nnnn .......,OS 21m  .
Step 2. Take ),,( iiii cban location; assign ia = iR ; the set of all the racks that store items is
expressed as mRS  ,..., 1 jj RR , mj  .....2,1 , Im
Step 3. With the relation of  1,  iii AAR , determine and descend the set of possible picking aisles
that the IMCD might choose; this is expressed as mPA  ,........, 1 jj AA , kj  .....2,1 ,
Ik 
Step 4. Expand the elements in set mPA ; the possible aisle that might be used to pick the items on a
rack is given a weighted value 1, and the others are left blank. Total the weight value of each
element iA in mPA , as indicated in Table 5. Therefore, iA element in mPA will have
two possible weighted values (1, 2). A weighted value of 1 indicates that only one rack row
(on the right side or on the left side of the aisle) is stored with items to be picked, whereas a
weighted value of 2 indicates that the rack rows on both sides of the aisle are stored with
items to be picked (this aisle is a so-caled ‘co-picking aisle’).

Step 5: If the weighted value of iA is larger than that of 1iA , then go to Step 6, if not, then go to
Step 7.
Step 6: This step is required if iA can pick more items stored on racks than 1iA , and if iA is
included in the set of real picking aisles RA . If the weighted value of iA is equal to 1iA ,
iA and 1iA aisles can pick items stored on the same rack rows, but aisle iA is closer to

Algorithm 2: Decide the picking sequence in picking aisles.
The ‘no-skip’ approach formulated by Goetschalckx and Ratlif (1988) can be used to decide 
the picking sequence in the real picking aisle. The approach is briefly described as follows.
Having established a network for the storage locations of the items that will be conveyed in
the picking aisle, with the ‘no-skip’ approach it does not mater whether the IMCD first picks the

Because more than one item might have to be picked in a given aisle, it is necessary to decide
the picking sequence in a picking aisle. The ‘no-skip’ approach is then used to decide the picking 
sequence in each picking aisle. The result of this arrangement is shown in Table 7. The two stages
are then combined to derive the picking sequence of IMCD for this order (as shown in Table 8).
Finally, based on the assumption that 5.0 cyx vvv m/sec and that 5.0 hwl meter, the
total picking travel-time calculation of this order is calculated as being 414 seconds in a one-sided
model and 240 seconds in a two-sided model.

6.The Middle Cross Aisle Picking Model (the third year)
In M-AS/RS model whatever one-sided or two-sided picking model, when the consecutive
picking location can not be picked within the same picking aisle, the IMCD has to move back to the
cross aisle. If the last picked item location is far way from the cross aisle, the IMCD has to move a
long distance back to the cross aisle. It is not economic for IMCD to travel through the racks with
long distance movement. Further the tremendous equipment rows have to move in order to create a
new picking aisle for IMCD to run. The movement of huge equipment rows not only increases the
operation performance but also enhances the risk of good damage.
In order to reduce the movement distance of IMCD running for picking the batch order items,
the middle cross aisle model (Figure 9) is proposed. The warehouse is divided to block A area and
block B area by the middle cross aisle.
6.1 Picking Model
The whole travel distance of IMCD for picking items of an order can be divided two stages. It
is assumed that the picking times of various stored items are fixed. The constructed objective
function therefore does not consider the retrieval time; rather, it calculates the travel distance of the
IMCD for order picking is calculated. The objective function is described as follows:

In order to apply IMCD on the automated picking model of MSS, we integrate the computer
ordering system, equipment sensors and IMCD controller as a cross aisle picking model of
M-AS/RS. The flowchart for the operation model of the whole M-AS/RS proposed in this study is
shown in Figure 10.

6.3 Operation Algorithm
There are three algorithms to be applied to achieve the optimal picking sequence in the
operation model. First, a picking-aisle-assignment algorithm is required to decide the real picking
aisle for IMCD so as to reduce the number of aisles for the IMCD run in the warehouse blocks. The
second procedure is to decide the sequence among real picking aisles. The third procedure is to
discover the shortest path in the picking aisle. We integrated the above three algorithms and then
form the whole batch order picking sequence. The three algorithms were described in details as
follows:
Algorithm 1: Deciding the real picking aisle for IMCD run in blocks separately
Using the following 9 steps, we can decide the real picking aisle in the warehouse block A, and
achieve the minimum number of picking aisles. The same steps also can be applied to get the
picking aisles in block B.
Step 1. Deciding the set of batch order of items  nnnn .......,OS 21m  .
Step 2. Taking ),,( iiii cban location; assigning ia = iR ; the set of all the racks that stored items is
expressed as mRS  ,..., 1 jj RR , mj  .....2,1 , Im .
Step 3. With the relation of  1,  iii AAR , determining and ascending the set of possible picking
aisles that the IMCD might choose; this is expressed as mPA  ,........, 1 jj AA ,
kj  .....2,1 , Ik  .
Step 4. Expanding the elements in set mPA ; the possible aisle that might be used to pick the items
on a rack is given a weighted value 1, and the others are left blank. Total the weighted value
of each element iA in mPA , is shown on Table 10. Therefore, iA element in mPA will
have two possible weighted values (1, 2). A weighted value of 1 indicates that only one rack
row (on the right side or on the left side of the aisle) stores with items to be picked,
whereas a weighted value of 2 indicates that the rack rows on both sides of the aisle store
with items to be picked (this aisle is a so-caled ‘co-picking aisle’).

Stage1: Decide the picking aisle in the blocks separately
The picking aisle-assignment algorithm described above is used to decide the picking aisle in
which the IMCD needs to move. The result of the block A is that the IMCD needs to move six
aisles to finish this order picking. The picking aisles in which the IMCD moves are 1A , 5A , 6A ,
9A and 10A . In block B, it only needs three aisles to finish this order picking. The picking aisles in
which the IMCD moves are 2B , 6B , and 8B .
Stage 2: Decide the picking sequence among the picking aisles
Because IMCD might run more than one aisle, it is necessary to decide the sequence among
picking aisles. The block A picking aisles are 1A , 5A , 6A , 9A and 10A . In block B, the picking
aisles are 2B , 6B , and 8B . According to descending block algorithms, the total sequence of picking
aisle are 10A , 9A , 8B , 6B , 6A , 5A , 2B and 1A .
Stage3 Decide the sequence in each picking aisles
The ‘no-skip’ approach is used to decide the picking sequence in each picking aisle. The result 
of this arrangement is shown in Table 12.
After integrating the separated picking aisle of different blocks (Table 12), the final picking aisle
sequence of the whole batch order is shown in Table 13

For instance, the sequence of order picking of this lot of items listed in 3 orders (Table 15) is
1OS , 2OS and 3OS . After an appropriate sequencing is made for the picking of the 8 product
items of each order according to descending sequencing, IMCD starts picking.

After the picking sequence is arranged, the control center commands the controller to
complete the picking of all items of the order in right sequence. The picking sequences obtained
from the Table 16 are matched with some parameters of warehousing environment and the picking
time required for the 3 orders are shown in Table 17.

7.2 Two-sided Model
Having calculated the total picking travel time of an exemplar order, three kinds of simulation
were executed to validate the proposed model: (1) with different levels of four factors (order size,
warehouse size, xv and yv ); (2) with different ratios of X–Y dimension speed ( xy vv ); and (3)
with different rack shapes ( lh ). The first simulation is performed to compare the performance of
the one-sided model with the two-sided model. The second and third simulations are used to
identify the optimal ratio of X–Y dimension speed ( xy vv ) and rack shape ( lh ) to produce optimal
performance. The three simulations are described below.
32
The results (Table 20) show that, in the two-sided model, the number of picking aisles in the
IMCD run, the number of equipment-row movements, and the average travel time are all obviously
smaller than is the case in the one-sided model for each combination. It is thus apparent that the
two-sided model has better performance than the one-sided model.
With regard to the number of aisles in the IMCD run and the number of equipment-row
movements, the smallest and largest proportional reductions of performance were found in
combination three and in combination 7 (the number of aisles :3.2% and 97.1%; the number of
equipment-row movements :3.2% and 94.3%). This means that the number of aisles in the IMCD
run and the number of equipment-row movements are in direct proportion. With respect to average
travel time, the average reduction in terms of three levels of warehouse size were 59.5%, 30.4%,
and 17.1%; demonstrating that larger warehouse size has lower-order density with certain order
quantities, and that the number of co-picking aisles therefore affects performance significantly. In
contrast, a smaller warehouse size has higher-order density with certain order quantities,
demonstrating that the number of co-picking aisles does not affect the performance
significantly—because the number of picking aisles of the IMCD does not differ significantly
between the one-sided model and the two-sided model runs.
7.2.2 X–Y dimension speed ratio ( xy vv )
Assume a warehouse with 10 rows, 10 columns, 10 layers, and mhwl 1 . The xv
values were set at 5.0 , 1, and sec/2m , and the ratios of X–Y dimension speeds, xy vv , were set
from 0.1 to 5.0 in increments of 0.1. In all, there were therefore fifty experiments. According to the
above value settings, each experiment runs 150 orders generated by computer under order sizes of
5, 15, 25, 35, and 50 respectively. The average time of each experiment is shown in Figures 12, 13
and 14.

rapidly when the ratio was greater than about 1. In practice, a very small ratio of lh is not used in
warehouses because the height of the rack is too small to store goods.
Therefore, it can be argued that the optimal ratio range for lh is from about 0.6 to 1.0. This
result is similar to the research result of Amit and Rosenblatt (1994).

Although the two-sided model of M-AS/RS has some advantages, some practical
considerations have to be taken into account. These include the establishment costs, operational
costs, the physical environment of the storage area, the frequency of storage and retrieval, and

l were set from
0.1 to 5.0 in increments of 0.1. In all, there were therefore fifty experiments.
Based on order sizes of 5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 items, the simulations results are shown as
Figures 18 and 19. The results indicate that the average travel time increased rapidly when the ratio
was greater than about 1. In practice, a very small ratio of w
l is not used in warehouses because
the length of the rack is too small to store goods.

Therefore, it can be argued that the optimal ratio range for w
l is from about 0.6 to 1.0. This
result is supporting the findings of previous research (Petersen, 1997).
7.3.3 Aisle Depth
This experiment analysis examined whether the depth of aisle affects the performance of
picking time. Assume a warehouse with 10 rows, 5 layers with different columns. The depth of aisle
38
(1) Space Utility Rate
The existing MSS is always limited by the high restriction of manual operation. The height of
rack is even restricted. The IMCD adopted by the research can reach any height of the
warehousing center. Therefore, the space utility rate of M-AS/RS is higher than that of MSS.
(2) Storage and Retrieval Speed
MSS requires a picker to go to the picking aisle and press the button manually (the picker is
waiting), or create an aisle by manual operation. In the picking process, the picker has to inspect
at any time the picking location, product item and quantity, etc. But M-AS/RS has automated
operation function. When the row of rack is moved, IMCD moves simultaneously. It can reduce
the waiting time for creation of picking aisle. Therefore, comparatively M-AS/RS has absolute
superiority in terms of storage and retrieval speed.
(3) Rate of Error
Through integration of the systems of controller and sensor, M-AS/RS cans effectively
decreases the error caused by manual picking operation, including the error of product item and
quantity, etc. Thus, M-AS/RS had better performance than MSS.
(4) Warehousing Cost
The M-AS/RS proposed by this research has the characteristics of downsized labor, high space
utility rate, low transportation cost of supplies and simple management. Therefore, the
warehousing unit cost of M-AS/RS is lower than manual operation.
(5) Safety
M-AS/RS can operate in a system under bad warehousing environment, and no staffs are
required to involve in its operation. Hence, many risks of industrial safety can be avoided.
(6) Items to be Stores
MSS adopts a picker-to-stock picking way. Its manual operation is restricted by the
limitations of labor and tool. Therefore, it is more suitable to store small articles, such as books,
documents, small parts, etc. But the M-AS/RS proposed by this study can bring a breakthrough to
this limitation. With the use of log-formed board for loading, M-AS/RS can store item of larger
size or heavier weight. It is not just restricted to small articles.
7.4.2 Two-sided Model
The two-sided model proposed in this study promises greater efficiency in several respects.
Moreover, the results of simulations indicate that a larger number of co-picking aisles provides
better performance in the proposed model. The study suggests that the optimal ratio range for lh
is from about 0.6 to 1.0 and that the optimal ratio range for xy vv is from about 0.6 to 1.0.
In practical terms, the combination of the whole model and a computerized control (to
construct a fully automated picking system) can thus overcome the deficiencies in existing
one-sided M-AS/RS picking models. Finally, a comparison of the differences between a two-sided
picking model and a one-sided picking model is shown in Table 24.
Table 24: The difference of picking models between one-sided and two-sided
40
Second model is the two-sided picking model which enhance performance from modified
picking device and movement path. In the two-sided model, proposed “co_picking aisle” algorithm, 
in this way, can get the minimum picking aisle number needed for picker run in batch order picking
operation. It can achieve great improvement in efficiency. In this model, we also found that the
optimal ratio range for lh is from about 0.6 to 1.0 and the optimal ratio range for xy vv is from
about 0.6 to 1.0. It is very useful to set parameters of warehouse in picker M-AS/RS.
In view of aisle layout this study proposed the third model. By changing the cross aisle layout
from the front cross aisle to middle cross aisle that reduce the movement distance for IMCD run in
picking operation. This model is very suitable for warehouse with deep depth aisles and order with
low density situations. In this model, we also found that the optimal ratio range for wl is from
about 0.6 to 1.0.
Although the M-AS/RS has so many advantages, including high space utility rate, storage and
retrieval speed, safety, flexible, low rate of error and low operation cost. There are some practical
considerations have to be taken into account while establishing the automatic MSS, such as the
establishment costs, operational costs, physical environment of the storage area, the frequency of
storage and retrieval, and particular issues of human safety. Each individual facility will have to
take these factors into account in making decisions about the suitability of various technological
options in utilizing IMCD.
