摘要 
 
生產與配送為供應鏈管理中兩個主要

配送則是探討如何將產品從工廠運送至顧
客，整合生產及配銷問題稱為生產配送問
題。過去單獨討論生產或配送問題的相關
研究文獻多以各自最小成本為目標，卻忽
略整合考慮，而使總成本(生產配送成本)
提高。因此生產與配送問題若能同時考

業界及學術界的重要課題。過去討論生產

方式分為：(1)直接往返配送(只針對單一顧
客運送)，及(2)路徑巡迴方式(多個顧客在
總需求量小於車容量限制下配送)兩種，其
中後者對於成本計算較為準確，較能做出
正確的決策，若生產配送問題能同時考慮
車輛巡迴配送，將是一具研究及實務價值
之議題，而時窗限制過去在生產配送問題
扮演相當重要角色，然而直到目前尚未有

之，交期(時窗限制)較晚則可選擇成本較低

(車輛巡迴配送)，故交期(時窗限制)將直接

Abstract 
 
Production and distribution are two major 
processes in supply chain management 
(SCM). Production distribution problem 
(PDP) combines production planning and 
transportation decisions, which is to 
sequence customers’ orders and to schedule 
vehicles’ routes to meet customers’ demands, 
in order to minimize the total system cost. 
PDP is consisted of two sub-problems: 
production problem and distribution problem. 
Production problems are to choose candidate 
production facilities from a given set of 
customers’ order to minimize the production 
cost. Distribution problems are to determine 
optimal delivery routes from a given 
production site to some geographically 
dispersed customers. Both decisions affect 
each other. It would be better to be 
considered together. However, they are 
always considered separately based on the 
 1
PRPTW also belongs to the class of NP 
problems [Chen et al., 1998]. Since finding 
the optimal solution(s) for this model is an 
NP (non-polynomial) problem, exact 
algorithm seems infeasible to solve the 
problem. Hence, it is worthwhile to develop 
some heuristic methods. Until now, there is 
no heuristic method proposed for solving 
PRPTW. Since the problem structure of 
PRPTW can be decomposed into PSPTW 
and VRPTW, thus heuristic methods used in 
PSPTW and VRPTW are reviewed in this 
paper. For PSPTW, some dispatching rules 
such as EDD, SPT, LPT, etc. have been 
proposed [Koulamas, 1994]. De et al. [1994] 
proposed a greedy randomized adaptive 
search heuristic procedure. The procedure 
consists in two phases: an initial solution is 
constructed in the first phase through 
controlled randomization, and is improved in 
the second phase through steepest descent 
neighborhood search. Lee and Kim [1995] 
proposed a genetic algorithm and James 
[1997] proposed a tabu search for this 
problem. For VRPTW, several metaheuristic 
methods such as simulated annealing (SA) 
[Chiang and Russell, 1993], tabu search (TS) 
[Potvin et al., 1996] and genetic algorithm 
(GA) [Chen et al., 1998] are proposed to find 
solutions for VRPTW [Tan et al., 2001a]. 
Meanwhile, several hybrid artificial 
intelligence based techniques including 
simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic 
algorithm are also proposed [Tan et al., 
2001b].  
 
 
3.研究方法 (Methodologies) 
 
In this project, a heuristic method is 
proposed to solve PRPTW consisting of two 
sub-problems: PSPTW and VRPTW. The 
initial solution is obtained first and then the 
improvement procedure is developed for the 
initial solution. The procedure of this 
heuristic method is as follows (Figures 1, 2 
and 3):

摘要 
Urgent demands from customers, known as rush orders, often occur in industries. 
However, most existing studies seldom discuss the economical justification of 
accepting such orders. In this paper, a method is proposed to decide whether or not an 
arriving rush order should be accepted in a supply chain environment. In this method, a 
reward of accepting the rush order is compared with an extra cost generated by other 
affected orders caused by accepting the rush order in the supply chain. If the reward is 
greater than or equal to the extra cost, the rush order is accepted. Otherwise, the rush 
order is rejected. In order to verify this proposed method, three non-controlled order 
acceptance methods: (1) rejecting all rush orders, (2) accepting all rush orders and (3) 
randomly accepting rush orders are used to compare with this proposed method on the 
criterion of total profit via computer simulation. The results show the proposed method 
outperforms these three non-controlled order acceptance methods.

customers’ demand economically [1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 12]. Rush orders from customers often occur in supply 
chains. The rush orders are defined as immediate customers’ demands that exceed the expectation of the 
production schedule [13]. When rush orders arrive, these orders have the highest operated priority and 
the planned production orders must be idle to wait for the rush order to be manufactured. Accepting rush 
orders unconditionally may not be a good strategy. Since accepting each rush order would increase sales 
and profit; however, side effect may include the delay of planned production orders and the increase of 
orders’ carrying cost. Hence, to determine whether or not an arriving rush order should be accepted 
becomes a major issue. Even though the rush order acceptance justification problem is quite common in 
supply chains, the justification methods of accepting such orders are seldom discussed in most existing 
studies [6, 9].  
A deterministic cost model [13] which can justify the acceptance of rush orders for one single stage 
system was proposed to model and solve this problem. However, rush orders may arrive at any moment 
in a stochastic dynamic environment. A detailed cost computation for accepting these rush orders seems 
impossible in job shops because the carrying cost and the tardy penalty cost for accepting these rush 
orders are unknown and cannot be computed easily. In addition, this method is developed for single 
stage systems. Hence, this method cannot be applied in the job shop production.  
Several order acceptance methods for arriving orders, which have no operated priority, were proposed 
such as monolithic approach, hierarchical approach, etc. [6, 7, 11]. However, these approaches still 
cannot be directly applied in the rush order acceptance method since their assumptions are different from 
those of rush order. Until now, there is no economical method to justify whether or not an arriving rush 
order should be accepted in a complex production system such as job shops.  
In this paper, a method is proposed to decide whether or not an arriving rush order should be accepted 
in a supply chain. The economical justification method of rush order acceptance is developed based on 
the comparison of the reward by accepting the rush order and the computed extra cost by accepting this 
rush order. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, the methodology is 
presented. In Section 3, the system considerations are presented and the simulation model is described. 
In Section 4, the performance of rush order acceptance methods are measured under the criterion of total 
profit. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section 5.

 A flowchart of the decision process for the rush order acceptance method is given in Figure 1 and the 
method works as follows: 
Step 1: Compute the reward of accepting one specific rush order r. 
Step 2: Compute the extra cost of accepting the rush order r. 
Step 3: Compare the reward with the extra cost. If the reward is greater than or equal to the extra cost, 
the rush order r is accepted. Otherwise, the rush order r is rejected.

2.2.2.1 The method for computing the idle time 
 
We assume the arrival time of the rush order r is t. The operation number is n. The operation 
sequence is O1, O2, O3,....., On. The operation time is t1, t2, t3,....., tn. The algorithm is given in Figure 
3 and works as follows: 
Step 1: Set the global time T = t; set N = n; set i = 1. 
Step 2: Adjust the system clock with the global time T. 
Step 3: Check the buffer of the station i. If there are planned production orders waiting for process, 
record these orders with the idle time ti. 
Step 4: T = T + ti, i = i+1.

A good choice of the p value is very difficult because the optimal p value changes with the system 
status. Neural network (NN) method is used to find the optimal p value to represent the optimal potential 
tardy level in this study. NN is a method used for prediction widely and better than linear models such as 
regression analysis [4]. In the previous studies, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPN) is selected for 
prediction more often than other type of Neural Network [5]. Hence, BPN is choosen in this paper for 
predicting p. Figure 4 shows the structure of the BPN.

3.1 Assumptions of simulation models 
 
A hypothetical supply chain simulation model is built to evaluate this rush order acceptance method. 
The supply chain consisted of five work centers, each with a single machine performing a unique 
processing function. The arrival of planned production orders to the supply chain is random with 
interarrival time that is exponential variables and the rush orders arrive with Poisson distribution. 
Assumed the supply chain can manufacture five product types. The data of the product types are given 
in Table 1. The material cost and the manufacturing expense of each product type are given in Table 2 
and Table 3..

3.3 Performance Measures and Data Collection 
 
The primary performance measure in the supply chain under this study is the total profit, where the 
total profit consists of the reward of rush orders, the profit of planned production orders and the total 
cost of planned production orders. The total profit is defined as: 
Total profit = Total reward of rush orders + Total profit of planned production orders - Total cost of 
planned production orders 
The system starts in an “empty and idle” state and is brought to a steady state by using the first 3000 
orders as the warm-up period. Statistics are collected for 20000 orders after the warm-up period. The 
number of replication is determined through several pilot runs. It is conducted that performing 12 times of 
replication achieves sufficient precision in estimating the total profit performance measure.  
As for the BPN model, pilot simulation for different factor combinations is executed. 24000 sets of 
data are generated. The stop criterion is when training times is equal to 24000 or RMSE is less than
