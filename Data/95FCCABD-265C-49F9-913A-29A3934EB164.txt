Fig. 1. Two-phase transmission in cooperative transmission.
It is assumed that at most one relay participates in cooper-
ative transmission. Although cooperation with multiple relays
provides more diversity gains and thus better performance, it
requires coordination such as clock synchronization among the
participating relays. In this paper, we assume that the network
architecture is distributed (i.e., no centralized controller) and
clock synchronization is not available.
Throughout this project, only amply-and-forward is consid-
ered. Therefore two copies of data will be received at the
destination after the two-phase cooperative transmission. We
further assume that in cooperative transmission, the destination
decodes the two copies of the data frame using maximal-ratio
combining (MRC). MRC requires the modulation used by the
source and the relay to be the same. Therefore, the source and
relay are required to use the same combination of coding and
modulation.
The cooperative transmission takes advantage of the diver-
sity gain and consequently has lower frame error probability.
However, the transmission time of a frame also increases due
to extra signaling overhead and the repeated data transmission
by the relay. To reduce the increased transmission time so as
to achieve a higher throughput, the devices are allowed to use
modulations with higher constellations when using cooperative
transmission. That is, the devices may change modulation
adaptively according to the potential diversity gain that can be
obtained via cooperation. For example, a device may choose
BPSK when using direct transmission, while choosing 16QAM
(or higher modulation) in cooperative transmission. The time
difference between these two modulation schemes is illustrated
in Figure 2.
For fair comparison between direct and cooperative trans-
mission schemes, energy consumption for transmitting a single
data frame in either scheme is kept the same. That is, the
energy spent by the source to transmit the data frame in direct
transmission is equal to the total energy spent by the source
and the relay during the two-phase cooperative transmission.
In this project, the energy spent by the source and the relay is
assumed to be equal in cooperative transmission.
Although different modulations can be used for data trans-
mission, it is assumed that the total energy spent for each

transmission is fixed. To achieve that, we adjust the per-symbol
energy while keeping the symbol rate the same. For example,
if a device uses binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) with a per-
symbol energy of Es, the per-symbol energy becomes 3Es
when using 8 phase-shift keying (PSK). It is because the
transmission time is reduced to one third when the bit rate
triples (from 1 bit per symbol to 3 bit per symbol). Similarly, a
devices should use 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
with per-symbol energy of 4Es and so on.
The hidden node problem is negligible here because our
protocol is designed primarily for a small scale network such
as personal area network (PAN). The coverage of a wireless
PAN is typically a few meters. The situations that devices are
hidden to each other occur rarely.
III. RESEARCH METHOD
There are two methods for a device to transmit data in our
protocol, namely direct transmission, and cooperative transmis-
sion. When the quality of the direct link between the source
and the destination is good, the source might just use direct
transmission and meet the performance requirement. However,
when the quality of the direct link is poor, cooperative transmis-
sion may be an alternative. The proposed “FC-MAC” allows
a device to automatically switch between direct transmission
and cooperative transmission according to the link quality.
When a device uses the cooperative transmission, “FC-MAC”
allows the potential relays to compete and finally one of them
will cooperate with the source. The detail of “FC-MAC” is
described as follows.
All devices are in the “Idle” state initially. If a device has data
frames to transmit,it shall first obtain the access to the channel.
A device shall use the carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
with collision avoidance (CA) and random backoff to obtain
the channel access. After the device (i.e. the source) obtains
the channel access, it sends out the RTS frame and waits for
the “clear to send” (CTS) frame from the target device (i.e. the
destination). If the destination receives the RTS frame correctly,
it responds with a CTS frame. So far, the described “RTS-CTS
handshake” process is the same as the IEEE 802.11 protocol.
To enable cooperation in the above protocol, a relay must
be identified and then participate in the transmission. In the
proposed protocol, any other devices that hear both the RTS
frame and the CTS frame are considered as “potential relays”,

an acknowledgement frame. If the source does not receive the
acknowledgment frame before a timeout, it retransmits the data
frame and cooperates with the same relay using the above
procedure until the number of retransmissions exceeds a pre-
defined value.
If the source transmits the data frame directly, it sends out
the data and waits for the acknowledgment frame from the
destination. The source retransmits the data frame directly until
an acknowledgement frame is received.
The flow chart of the above procedure is illustrated in
Figure 4, and the frames exchange sequence is illustrated in
Figure 6.

fading factors are independent constants during different blocks
of transmissions. In other words, we assume that the fading
factor is a constant during one frame exchange sequence, so the
potential relays can obtain each SNR information as described
in section III. The SNR is used to calculate the frame error
rates, which are used in computing the expected throughput
of cooperative transmission. The relation of the SNR and the
frame error rate for different modulations is depicted in Figure
7. Unlike the data frame, control frames such as RTS frames,
CTS frames, Anc frames, and Ack frames are assumed to be
error free, because these control frames in our protocol are
transmitted using the most robust transmission mode.
The symbols used in the following analysis are shown
in Table I. Let the distances of the source-relay link, the
source-destination link, and the relay-destination link be DSD,
DSR, and DRD, respectively. Energy per bit used in direct
transmission is Eb. For fair comparison, energy per bit used
in cooperative transmission by the source and the relay is
Ebh = Eb/2. The received SNR at the destination in direct
transmission can be expressed as SNRDDes = γ

According to Eq.(11) and Eq.(15), a relay can compute
the expected throughput when it relays the data for a given
channel condition and K. However, in a distributed network,
each potential relay cannot obtain the value of K. In order to
evaluate its contribution to the transmission between the source
and the destination, each relay sets K = 1. That is, the relay
assume that only itself helps the source. By computing the
throughputs (with K = 1) for different modulations, the relay
chooses the modulation that results in the highest throughput
for transmission when the relay participate in cooperation.
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we conduct some simulations to evaluate the
proposed protocol. The parameters used in the simulations are
shown in Table III. These values are primarily based on the
IEEE 802.11a protocol. In the simulation, independent block
fading is assumed for each link. The path loss exponent is
3. According to the link quality, a device can choose the
modulation scheme from BPSK, 8 PSK, 16 QAM, and 64
QAM. For each modulation,the frame error rate for a given

Fig. 9. System throughput of direct transmission and the proposed protocol
SNR is simulated using the bit-interleaved convolutional code
with a code rate of 12 (as shown in Figure 7). In the simulation,
we use topology 1 and the topology 2 as shown in Figure 8. In
both topologies, the locations of the source and the destination
are fixed. The control frames may have errors here, so when the
control frames cannot be decoded correctly, the source restarts
the transmission after the time out (i.e., SIFS time later at the
end of control frame transmission).
We first compare the system throughput of the proposed
protocol and direct transmission. The system throughput is
defined as the average number of bits per second successfully
delivered. Figure 9 shows the system throughput of direct
transmission and the proposed protocol at different SNRs. As
one can see, the proposed protocol outperform the direct trans-
mission in the topology 1, has a gain around 3 dB. The system
throughput at low SNRs has more than 20% improvement.
As the SNR goes higher, the improvement decreases as the
signal strength is strong enough for the source to communicate
with the destination directly. In topology 2, where the potential
relays are not close to both the source and the destination, the
