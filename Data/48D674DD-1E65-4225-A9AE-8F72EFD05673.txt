1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Advances in manufacturing technologies 
now permit the use of fullerene C60 in the 
fabrication of C60 thin films or single crystals 
using sublimation or physical vapor deposition 
processes [1-5]. This facilitates the exciting 
development of fullerene-based applications 
that exploit the particular characteristics of 
fullerene C60, namely superior mechanical, 
optical and electronic properties [6-9]. 
Significant research has been conducted into 
the growth of C60 and other members of the 
fullerene family, e.g. C20, C28 and C36, on 
carbon substrates [10-15] or on metal substrates 
[16]. Since the film properties are dependent 
upon the crystalline structure and the 
interaction with the substrate, it is essential that 
these factors are thoroughly analyzed and 
understood if the properties of the deposited 
film are to be optimized. 
Previous studies have employed both 
experimental and numerical techniques to 
investigate the growth mechanisms of a C60 
thin film and the interaction of the film with the 
substrate. Experimental studies generally 
carried out film structure measurements to 
demonstrate the superior properties of the 
film-substrate interaction. Gao and Zhang [17] 
presented X-ray diffraction studies of C60 and 
C70 fullerene films grown on an SiO2 substrate. 
Their results indicated that a fullerene film 
exhibits strong amorphous characteristics, but 
tends to a crystalline structure following heat 
treatment. In 1997, Schmidt et al. [18] 
employed high-resolution electron-energy-loss 
spectroscopy to study C60 films grown on a 
hydrogen-terminated Si(1 0 0) substrate. Their 
study reported a considerably higher degree of 
order of the C60 film when grown on 
hydrogen-terminated Si(1 0 0) as compared to 
when the film was deposited on a clean Si(1 0 0) 
substrate. Both studies attempted to define the 
process operating conditions that would yield 
optimum grown film properties. However, it is 
difficult to establish the dynamic interactions 
that take place between the C60 film and the 
substrate during deposition from off-line 
measurements of the structure. Therefore, 
dynamic film-substrate interactions are best 
explored via some form of numerical analysis. 
Katircioǧlu and Erkoç [19] employed 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to 
investigate the absorption and decomposition of 
C60 molecules on an Si(1 1 1) surface at 
elevated temperatures. They found that an 
abrupt decomposition of the C60 molecules on 
the substrate occurred at 910 K. Man et al. [20] 
also adopted MD simulation to study the 
collision of C70 clusters with a graphite (0 0 0 1) 
surface. Their results indicated that there is no 
significant difference between the nature of 
C70-graphite and C60-graphite interactions. 
However, the anisotropic characteristics of the 
film that may result when different initial 
orientation and spatial positioning of the cluster 
are considered were noted only for the C70 
clusters. Webb et al. [21] investigated the 
growth of a diamond-like carbon film formed 
by the energetic impacts of C60, C100 and C200 
clusters on a graphite surface. They determined 
that sp3- and sp-bonded carbon structures were 
most readily formed at a cluster incident energy 
of 100 eV/atom. 
           
at an incident energy of 10 eV. However, as the 
incident energy is increased to moderate levels 
of 20, 40 and 70 eV, the damage of the C60 
molecule becomes more apparent. At 20 eV, the 
left-hand portion of the C60 molecule is slightly 
broken, but when the incident energy is 
increased to 40 eV, the impact of the molecule 
upon the substrate causes most of the molecule 
to become damaged. Finally, at an incident 
energy of 70 eV, it can be seen that the entire 
C60 molecule suffers damage upon impact. 
At high incident energy intensities, i.e. 
those exceeding 70 eV, the C60 molecule 
structure collapses entirely and forms a “coat” 
on the diamond substrate. A close inspection of 
the collapsed C60 molecule morphology reveals 
the tendency of this coat to become flatter as 
the incident energy increases from 100 to 200 
eV. Furthermore, analysis of the transient 
snapshots for incident energies exceeding 70 
eV shows that some of the carbon atoms 
belonging to the C60 molecule fly away from 
the substrate surface. This indicates sputtering 
from the substrate caused by the highly 
energetic impact of the C60 molecule. 
Finally, it is noted that regarding the resilience 
phenomenon, the results of the present study 
are not in full agreement with those of previous 
studies [22] and [23]. Specifically, the 
simulation results indicate that the incident 
energy of C60 at which a perfect C60 structure is 
preserved, i.e. the C60 resilience, is lower than 
that reported previously in studies that 
considered the diamond substrate surface to be 
a hydrogen-terminated surface [22] and [23]. 
This discrepancy can be attributed to the 
present assumption of dangling bonds in the 
diamond substrate surface. The dangling bonds 
surface renders the C60 structure more liable to 
damage than the hydrogen-terminated surface, 
and hence the resilience is lowered. C60 atoms 
tend to stick more readily to a diamond surface 
than to a hydrogen-terminated surface since in 
the latter case, the hydrogen atoms prevent the 
C60 atoms from reacting directly with the 
carbon dangling bonds. The hydrogen layer 
also has the function of stabilizing the carbon 
dangling bonds and hence, reduces their 
reactivity. A similar conclusion has been 
presented in a previous study [26], which 
indicated that C60 atoms are more rarely 
reflected from a bare Si surface than from a Si 
surface with 1 or 2 hydrogen-terminated layers. 
The following section considers the coating 
ratio of the cluster, i.e. a measure of the number 
of cluster atoms that become attached (or 
bonded) on the diamond substrate, and 
investigates the influence of the incident energy 
upon this ratio. 
 
3.2. C60 molecule coating ratio 
 
The coating ratio is a statistical measure of 
the percentage of C60 molecule atoms that 
remain on the surface of the substrate following 
impact. Fig. 3 presents the variation in this ratio 
at steady state conditions for incident energies 
in the range 1–200 eV. It can be seen that there 
is a significant variation in the coating ratio as 
the incident energy is increased, and that the 
curve of the variation may be broadly divided 
into four regions, i.e. a plateau region (I), a 
descending region (II), an ascending region (III) 
and a second descending region. The average 
value of the coating ratio at each incident 
intensity is given by the intersection of the bar
