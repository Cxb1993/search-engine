一、計畫的緣由與目的 
SONOS(polysilicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silic
on) flash memory has been investigated to 
realize vertical scaling of flash memory. The 
faster programming speed and lower operating 
voltage of SONOS devices were accomplished 
in the past by reducing the tunnel oxide 
thickness [1-4]. However, this seriously 
degrades the retention capability of the memory 
devices. Several efforts have been made to 
improve the retention time of SONOS devices. 
She et al. [5] used HfO2 to replace Si3N4 and 
obtained a higher conduction band offset for 
better retention. Minami et al. [6] improved 
retention by using chemical-vapor-deposed 
blocking oxide and Bu et al. [7] improved 
retention by high-temperature deuterium 
annealing. Tan et al. [8] compared the Si3N4, 
HfO2, and HfAlO layers for charge storage layer 
and found that the large conduction band offset 
can minimize the over-erase phenomenon. In this 
work, we have explored other alternative 
candidates such as Dy2O3 and HfO2 for the 
charge storage layer which have good thermal 
stability and larger band offset with SiO2 [9].  
In this work, n-channel metal-oxide-high-k 
dielectric-oxide-silicon (MOHOS) capacitors 
and field effect transistors with HfO2 and Dy2O3 
as the charge storage layer were fabricated. For 
analysis purposes, we assume that the trapping 
depths in HfO2 and Dy2O3 are comparable and 
explain the performance difference between the 
MOHOS devices with HfO2 or Dy2O3 storage 
layers on the different conduction band offsets of 
these MOHOS structures. Fig. 1 (a) and (b) 
shows the energy band diagrams of the 
Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/p-Si and 
Al/SiO2/HfO2/SiO2/p-Si structures with 
programming gate bias, respectively. The 
conduction band offset between the tunnel oxide 
and the high-k dielectric layer is 2.31 eV for 
Dy2O3/SiO2 interface and 1.6 eV for HfO2/SiO2 
interface. The large conduction band offset is 
expected to improve the programming speed, the 
retention properties and the level of leakage 
current [8, 10]. 
 
二、研究方法及成果 
Fig. 2 (a) shows the current density versus 
applied voltage (J-V) curves of the MOHOS 
capacitors with Dy2O3 high-k dielectric layer 
annealed at temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 
700 °C and Fig. 2 (b) shows similar curves for 
HfO2 capacitors. The lowest leakage current of 
MOHOS capacitors with Dy2O3 was obtained at 
an annealing temperature of 400 ℃. The lowest 
gain [14].  
三、結論與討論 
In summary, MOHOS capacitors and field 
effect transistors with Dy2O3 and HfO2 high-k 
dielectrics as charge storage layers are fabricated. 
The electrical properties including programming 
speed, retention time and leakage current density 
were measured. The programming speed of 
Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si transistor is 
characterized by a Vth shift of 1.0 V with a 
programming stress pulse voltage of 12 V and a 
duration of about 10 ms. The same Vth shift well 
require a pulse duration of about 100 ms for 
Al/SiO2/HfO2/SiO2/Si transistors. As for 
retention properties, the Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si 
transistors keep a ΔVth window of 0.5 V after 
2x108 seconds, whereas the 
Al/SiO2/HfO2/SiO2/Si transistors can keep the 
same threshold voltage window for only 2x104 
seconds. The leakage current density of Dy2O3 
MOHOS capacitors is 10-8 A/cm2 at 8 V which is 
lower than MOHOS capacitors with HfO2 at 10-6 
A/cm2 and other similar studies reported in the 
literature [11, 12]. The lower leakage current 
level of Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si capacitors and 
the better performance of the 
Al/SiO2/Dy2O3/SiO2/Si transistors are attributed 
to the larger conduction band offset of 2.3 eV at 
the Dy2O3/SiO2 interface versus 1.6 eV at the 
HfO2/SiO2 interface. This prominent result has 
been accepted by IEEE Trans. Electron 
Devices.
