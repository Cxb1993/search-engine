Abstract 
This study utilizes a thermal-performance experiment with the illumination-analysis method to discuss the thermal 
performance of three kinds of LED based plates comparing the experiments, theories, and simulation thermal 
resistances. The results show that the thermal performance of the LED vapor chamber-based plate is better than that of 
the LED copper-based plate with an input power above 5 Watts. And the experimental thermal resistance values of LED 
copper- and vapor chamber-based plate are 0.41 /W and 0.38 /W at 6 Watt respectively. And the illumination of 6 ℃ ℃
Watt LED vapor chamber-based plate is 5 % larger than the 6 Watt LED aluminum-based plate. Thus, the LED vapor 
chamber-based plate has the best thermal performance above 5 Watts. 
Keywords：LED, Vapor Chamber, Illumination, Thermal performance.

to form the insulated compound. If the dielectric level is Al2O3, its thermal conductivity is about 24 W/mK and the 
thermal-expansion coefficient is about 7 ppm/K. If the dielectric level is AlN, its theral conductivity is about 170 W/mK 
and the thermal-expansion coefficient is about 6 ppm/K. The DCBS has the best thermal performance among the 
various types. 
However, a traditional DCBS is made of fine metal solid, the highest thermal conductivity is 401 W/mK, and the 
weight is too heavy. Therefore, this research uses a vapor chamber above 1000 W/mK, with light weight and antigravity 
characteristics to substitute for the present fine metal or the embedded heat pipe metal based plate, thus creating a new 
generation LED based plate. Because of the high thermal performance of the vapor chamber, which solves the hot-spot 
problem of high power LEDs, the proposal method can spread the quantity of the LED`s heat flow rapidly to the vapor 
chamber and conduct it to the thermal module. The device reduces the temperature of LEDs and enhances their lifetime. 
The vapor chamber has uniquely high performance and an isothermal feature; it has been developed and fabricated at a 
low-cost due to the mature manufacturing process. Wang et al. [9] applied a vapor chamber in a 30 Watt high-power 
LEDs vapor chamber-based plate and utilized the Windows program VCTM V1.0 to calculate the thermal performance 
of a vapor chamber-based thermal module. As shown in Figure 1 [10], the host of the vapor chamber may be composed 
of aluminum, copper or stainless steel, and the LED has a junction of electric circuits under the surface of the vapor 
chamber with high thermal conductivity and insulated grease between them; this high thermal conductivity and 
insulated grease may be constructed from aluminum nitride or boron nitride with an agglutination material. This electric 
circuit meets the point-system making it possible for the LED to constitute the electrical connection by using the silver 
rubber or eutectic method.  
Many studies have compared vapor chambers and fine metal based plates. Nowadays, the original vapor chamber, 
HPVCCP (Heat Pipe Vapor Chamber Cold Plates), proposed by Zuo and Dussinger [11] proposed in 1998, operates 
under a principle similar to the two-dimensional heat pipe. Sauciuc et al. [12] conducted heat-transfer property research 
in view of vapor chambers in 2002. The findings showed that the heat spreading performance of vapor chambers is 
higher than that with the same level of thickness with a metal plate. Xuan et al. [13] experimented on the thermal 
performance of a copper plate and a vapor chamber, and finally discovered that the temperature difference of a vapor 
chamber is smaller than that of a copper plate. Therefore, vapor chambers have good thermal diffusivity. In another 
study [14], the thermal conductivity of metal was not significantly influenced by the temperature. Close to constant 
values were observed. The thermal conductivity of pure copper is only 401 W/mK under room temperature. A vapor 
chamber may reach above 800 W/mK, as confirmed by an experiment [15, 16]. At present, thermal module 
manufacturers conduct the vapor chamber application in higher order CPU and VGA coolers [17-19]. The interior work 
fluid of a vapor chamber plays an extremely important role and the operating fluid is generally the pure water. This 
study takes copper-, aluminum- and the packing pure water of a bronze vapor chamber-based plate as the single four 
LED chips to make thermal analysis. The vapor chamber is appraised through experiments, theory, simulation and the 
intensity of illumination to serve as on LED based plate. 
2. Experimental Analysis Method 
Figure 2 shows the experimental apparatus and thermal resistance network of the LED based plate. Copper, 
aluminum and the vapor chamber were used to construct the LED based plate. The LEDs used four dies of white color. 
The operating voltage is 5.4 and the area of each die is 1 x 1 mm2, placing center symmetry with pitch of 2 mm. The 
power supply of ADC50-10 has a maximum voltage and ample of 50 and 10 respectively to employ these four dies as

3. Results and Discussions 
The experiment measures the illuminations, material resistances, spreading resistances, free convection resistances 
and based plate thermal resistances of copper-, aluminum- and vapor chamber-based plates with different input powers. 
We compare these experimental results with theoretical and simulation results to discuss their differences. Fig. 4 shows 
the experimental material mR , spreading spR  thermal resistances, free convection resistances cR  and based plate 
thermal resistances bR  of LED copper-, aluminum-, and vapor chamber-based plates with different input powers, 
respectively. From Fig. 4(a), the mR  of copper and aluminum are about 0.045 /W and 0.071 /W, with little change ℃ ℃
in input power. However, the mR  of vapor chamber shows greater change, from 1 Watt to 6Watt. This results from the 
interior two- phase flow. Its mR  is from 0.075 /W to 0.047 /W, with different levels of input power. The spreading ℃ ℃
resistances spR  are more significant than the material resistances mR  since the area ratio of the base plate and heat 
source has extreme value. From Fig. 4(b), the spR  of copper and aluminum are about 0.358 /W and 0.545 /W, ℃ ℃
with little change in input power. However, the spR  of vapor chamber shows a larger change from 1 Watt to 6Watts. Its 
spR  is from 0.45 /W to 0.34 /W, with different levels of input power. The reason is that the interior working fluid of ℃ ℃
the vapor chamber does not burn out after the operating temperature scope, carrying off the quantity of heat flow by the 
working fluid vaporization. This causes the thermal performance of the vapor chamber to dissipate in a two-dimensional 
direction, making it better than that of the copper- and the aluminum-based plates. The values of cR  of the copper, 
aluminum and vapor chamber reduce with different levels of input power, as seen in Fig. 4(c). This is because the 
velocity of natural convection increases with input power resulting from the circulation enhancement between light hot 
air and a large density of cold air. Finally, Fig. 4(d) is almost the same as the Fig. 4(b). The vapor chamber in this 
experiment only causes a few parts of the working fluid in the low heat flux situation to evaporate. As a result, in its 
latent heat carries off a small quantity of heat flow. The copper- and aluminum-based plates are composed of metal 
materials. The influence of their thermal conductivities is not great when the temperature is in a high heat flux situation. 
Therefore, based plate thermal resistance values are not significantly influenced by different levels of input power. 
Fig. 5 shows the theoretical and experimental based plate thermal resistances bR  of LED copper-, aluminum-, and 
the vapor chamber-based plates, respectively. From these results, EbR ,  and TbR ,  are copper, vapor chamber and 
aluminum by lower to high order at input power small or equal 4 Watt and the copper-based plate has the best thermal 
performance. But EbR ,  and TbR ,  are vapor chamber, copper and aluminum by fit to unfit quality order at input power 
above 5 Watt and the LED vapor chamber-based plate has the smallest value of bR . This is because the thermal

Keywords: LED lamp, Renewable energy, Ocean battery, sea water.
Abstract. This article utilities ocean battery drive LED lamp which is a symbol of NTOU. One of the
renewable green energy is sea water existing by the nature. The sea water battery has convenience of
usage and storage. LEDs will be a great benefit to the saving-energy and environmental protection in
the lighting lamps region. When we consider that the choice for providing power type, origin and
green, the ocean battery may offer the electric power of Direct Current (D.C.) for a long time which
causing it unexpected deficient and does not cause the marine pollution. There are two experiments
respectively to analyze that how long time the ocean battery can consume and these characteristics.
One is to have the loading resistance 2.95 KΩ in order to form the circuit, lets the ocean battery
discharge continually, each process 10 minutes later, gauges its voltage; Another lets the ocean
battery itself nature electric discharge, uses the tri-ammeter to gauge the ocean battery voltage. Then
we design a LED chart for NTOU fonts having dimensions of 2000 x 10 x 5 mm3 composing the soft
LED lamp strip which weld them on the aluminum based plate as indicative lamp in the night
navigation. The starting minimum voltage is 5 V and the maximum voltage is 12 V. The results show
that so long as the ocean battery vibrates light flipping, the voltage starts unstable, will draw
steady-state value after a few time. In other words, the air bubble will affect the voltage value in the
ocean battery; therefore we must pay attention to solve this question.
Introduction
Ocean battery employs the Seawater as the electrolyte [1]. For a ship, one of the renewable green
energy is sea water. The development only need sea water to be purged in the ocean battery which can
supply electric power, through the unique electric power supply method, can give the green energy
continuously, hangs carries the boat named Dreamer. In the marine navigation, we obtain the
renewable green electric power source acting sea water to produce the current resulting from the
different metal potential energy, which the sea water has inexhaustible, therefore we ponder the ocean
battery to generate electricity, by this regard ship Dreamer the long-time electric power source. The
use of sea water battery power is to provide LED (Light Emitting Diode) lights up, and now the rise of
green energy, in order to maintain the energy and the environment, to nature in the presence of
pollution-free material and Seawater. In the 1960s, the solid-state semiconductor elements cold light
LED based on the two semiconductors of the IV chemical family elements Germanium (Ge) and
Silicon (Si) firstly employs in the indicating or display infrared ranges, which has caused many
advantages including small packaging, light weight, energy savings, and anti-vibration and long
lifetime [2, 3]. LED is the illumination diode composed of P-type and N-type semiconductors,
exerting in the electrode contact along to the voltage in order to enable the electronic caper and the
energy gap release by the light form. It will be visible to the human eye if the light wave length
belongs to the visible light scope resulting from the difference between energy gaps. If lighting
brightness classification, can be divided into high brightness and the general brightness of single LED
die, usually more than 1 Watt per single die as high-brightness and high-power LED. In other words,
with high-luminance or high-power LED, the heat generation is above 1 Watt for a single LED die.
The power package of a catachrestic single LED die has a surface area of 1mm2 with a total heat
power of 1 Watt. Thus single high-power LEDs usually have heat flux of above 100 Watt/cm2 [4, 5].
finish the prototype of ocean battery drawing through the 3-D Software of solidworks as shown in
Fig.2. The dimensions are 130 x 100 x 70 mm3. The thickness of PMMA is 5 mm.

Results and Discussions
The experiment studies the relationship between discharge and contact area of the ocean batteries
electrode. Using the different metals of potential, water-activated current generated, it can provide
energy. Testing approach is that there are two groups of the same weight of the surface area of
electrodes connected to different load discharge test, and the composition of the two electrode
materials are the same, and both are bound to the same power capacity. Then change the electrode and
the carbon powder to the contact area, neither change in the case of other conditions, the test size of
the difference between the discharge voltages. Magnesium or magnesium alloy is usually selected as
the sea water battery anode resulting from the discharge force of the higher, good of the discharge
performance and light weight. But the chemical reaction of magnesium with sea water generates
hydrogen, surrounded by the film formed around the magnesium within the cell impedance; this
phenomenon is called polarization, affecting the discharge efficiency. The ocean battery has about
110 x 90 x 60 mm3 sea water reservoir. The loading resistance is 20Ωin order to form the circuit, lets
the ocean battery discharge continually, each process 20 minutes later, gauges its voltage as shown in
Tables 1 and 2. They show the mean voltage of about 0.34 and 0.32 voltages respectively.

We need to understand how much times can the sea water battery depletion. There are two kinds of
experiments formed with load resistance path, let the sea water continued to discharge the ocean
battery, each after 10 minutes, measuring the voltage; the other is to let the water naturally discharge
the battery itself, the use of three electric sea water table measured battery voltage. Fig. 3 shows the
loading resistance is 2.95 KΩin order to form the circuit, lets the ocean battery discharge continually.
Fig. 4 shows no loading resistance to discharge. From these figures, slight touch on the ocean battery
will change the voltage, and its value will be steady state for a while. Another problem is the bubble
also affected the voltage. So we should pay attention to these problems for design the series-parallel
ocean batteries in the future.
