Remediation of petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminated 
groundwater using oxidant-releasing material 
 
Abstract 
Contamination of soil/groundwater supplies by gasoline and other 
petroleum-derived hydrocarbons released from underground storage tanks (USTs) is a 
serious and widespread environmental problem. Corrosion, ground movement, and poor 
sealing can cause leaks in tanks and associated piping. Petroleum hydrocarbons contain 
methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) (a fuel oxygenate), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, 
and xylene isomers (BTEX), the major components of gasoline, which are hazardous 
substances regulated by many nations.The objective of this proposed study is to assess 
the potential of using a passive in situ oxidation barrier system. This passive active 
barrier system has advantages over conventional systems including less maintenance, 
cost-effectiveness, no above-ground facilities, no groundwater pumping and reinjection, 
and groundwater remediation in situ. The oxidation barrier system included a 
persulfate-releasing barrier, which contains persulfate-releasing materials. The 
slow-released persulfate would oxidize MTBE and benzene in aquifer. The 
persulfate-releasing materials would release persulfate when contacts with groundwater, 
thus oxidizes the MTBE and benzene. In the first part of this study, bench scale 
experiment was also performed to produce the persulfate-releasing materials high 
persulfate-releasing rate. The components of the persulfate-releasing materials and 
optimal concentrations of those components were determined in this study. Results 
indicate that the highest persulfate releasing rate can be obtained when the mass ratio of 
cement/sand/water was 1.4/0/0.7. Result obtained from the persulfate-releasing 
materials test and bench-scale were used for the design and operation of the following 
column experiments. Results from the column experiment indicate that approximately 
98% of MTBE and 99% of benzene could be removed during the early 
persulfate-releasing stage. The proposed treatment scheme would be expected to 
provide a more cost-effective alternative to remediate MTBE and other 
petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminated aquifers. Knowledge obtained from this study 
will aid in designing a persulfate oxidation system for site remediation.

依據釋氧化劑物質批次實驗之結果選定最佳比例，以連續式反應裝置

首先將 MTBE、benzene、現地地下水、亞鐵及濃硫酸溶液一併填充於水袋內，
MTBE 及 benzene 濃度分別為 0.2 mg/L 及 0.3 mg/L、亞鐵濃度約為 100 mg/L 及
濃硫酸 20 mL，管柱 1、管柱 3、管柱 4 及管柱 5 內填充現地含水層土壤模擬現地
情況，再將人工配製水樣經蠕動幫浦送至管柱 1-5 中。當人工配製水樣流經管柱 1
時，可瞭解污染物經含水層土壤後之吸附情形，管柱 2 內僅放置以最佳比例配方
合成之釋氧化劑物質，模擬釋氧化劑物質投入現地井中情況，其中投入釋氧化劑
物質之數量視批次試驗之結果而定。管柱 3-5 則模擬氧化劑及污染物混合後流經下

層析儀(GC-FID)分析污染物濃度(MTBE 及 benzene)、副產物濃度[第三丁基醇
(tert-butyl alcohol, TBA)、第三丁基醛(tert-butyl formate, TBF)及丙酮(acetone)]；水

總鐵及亞鐵濃度，其結果如表 2 所示。由結果得知 TOC 濃度為 4.5 mg/L，因此對
於過硫酸鹽降解反應應較無影響。另外由樣品中鹼度濃度為 95.8 mg CaCO3/L，由
於過硫酸鹽催化後水中 pH 降低呈酸性，若水中含有鹼度可提供緩衝能力。另外亞
鐵及總鐵濃度分別為 0.064 mg Fe2+/L 及 0.264 mg Fe3+/L，由於亞鐵濃度較低無法
有效催化過硫酸鹽產生硫酸根自由基，因此於實際進行管柱試驗時，則另外添加
100 mg Fe2+/L 於供試現地地下水中，以期具有持續催化效果。 
表 3 為現地含水層土壤基本性質分析，結果得知供試土壤中有機質為 0.06%，
應對過硫酸鹽反應無任何影響，而重金屬方面，鐵濃度為 26.7 mg/kg，並測得其他
重金屬，期望該些金屬對於過硫酸鹽具有催化效果。另外土壤質地為壤土質砂土，
因此供試地下水於供試土壤之流動性應較良好。

由結果得知，殘餘過硫酸鹽濃度與硫酸鹽濃度趨勢相同，顯示過硫酸鹽確實經亞
鐵離子催化後產生硫酸根自由基，進而將污染物反應降解，因而產生硫酸鹽。圖

4. 供試土壤異相催化 
過硫酸鹽是一種新開發的氧化劑，可經由熱或金屬催化後產生硫酸根自由基
(SO4-．)，其優點包括穩定；不傾向與土壤中有機物反應，因此較適用於有機物含
量高的土壤。根據文獻指出曾利用銀與銅當成催化過硫酸鹽氧化自然水體中污染
物，實驗結果發現水中有機物質可被完全氧化(Goulden and Anthony, 1978)，且利
用銀催化過硫酸鹽比銅與鐵催化效果更佳(Xu et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009)。Liang et 
al. (2004a)曾利用亞鐵離子催化氧化 TCE，結果證明金屬離子可產生催化反應。由
表 3 得知供試含水層土壤中，Fe 的濃度最高，可能供試含水層土壤中包含其他鐵
氧礦物異相催化過硫酸鹽產生硫酸根自由基，因此將供試含水層土壤及台灣常見
土壤中所含之鐵氧礦物如針鐵礦 (goethite)、赤鐵礦 (hematite)及氧化黑鐵
(ferric-ferrous oxide black)等標準品進行 X 光繞射分析儀(XRD)進行分析探討，結果
如圖 5 所示。圖 5(A)為原供試含水層土壤，其尖峰值為 26.8o，與針鐵礦(圖 4.11(B))
相同，顯示供試含水層土壤中之鐵礦大部分屬針鐵礦，當亞鐵離子濃度不足時，
其針鐵礦可能為提供異相催化之主要原因，由於過硫酸鹽催化相關研究中極少提
到異相催化，但 Fenton 及 Fenton-like 等相關文獻曾針對異相催化提出探討，
Tyre(1991)利用 goethite、magnetite 及 hematite 三種不同的氧化鐵礦物與過氧化氫
反應分解 PCE 的實驗中發現，goethite 為三者中對 PCE 有最佳處理效果的鐵氧礦
子濃度不足時，其針鐵礦可能為提供異相催化之主要原因。 
(七) 釋氧化劑物質整治牆整治技術具備透水性整治牆技術之初設成本及操作成本
低廉及現地化學氧化技術之整治期程短，適合應用於各種污染物。在考量成本
及效能上，釋氧化劑物質整治牆極具競爭力，但目前仍缺乏實際應用案例，未

1. Introduction 
Accidental releases of petroleum products (e.g., gasoline, diesel, fuel oil) from 
pipelines, aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), and underground storage tanks (USTs) 
are the most common causes of groundwater contamination in most countries. In most 
cases, released petroleum products would form non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), 
which will become the long-term source of groundwater contamination. Among those 
petroleum hydrocarbons contained in gasoline, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene 
isomers (BTEX), and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) are the major components of 
gasoline. They are the chemicals of concerns (COCs) from the human health point of 
view. The slow dissolution of residual BTEX and MTBE from the spill locations or 
from NAPL areas usually cause in the migration of petroleum-hydrocarbon plume in the 
subsurface. This would usually threaten the downgradient water resource and ecosystem. 
Given that it is usually very difficult to remove the NAPLs with a short period of time, 
more attention has been paid in controlling the further migration of the dissolved 
petroleum-hydrocarbon plume in mid-plume or downgradient areas. 
In contrast to other fuel components, MTBE is highly water soluble (water 
solubility = 51,000 mg/L) and has a low Henry’s Law constant (0.024 to 0.12 (Cair/Cwater 
at 25°C)) and soil adsorption coefficient [octanol water partition coefficient (Kow) = 
1.20 (Coctanol/Cwater at 25°C)] (ITRC, 2005a). MTBE has been identified as a potential 
human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (US EPA, 1993). 
Due to the high solubility, biorecalcitrance, and poor volatility of MTBE, groundwater 
treatment can be very challenging (US EPA, 2004; ITRC, 2005a; Pruden et al., 2005; 
Chen et al., 2010; Youngster et al., 2010). Benzene is ranked #6 on 2003 CERCLA 
Priority List of Hazardous Substances based on frequency of occurrence at EPA 
National Priorities List (NPL) sites, toxicity, and potential for human exposure to these 
substances (ATSDR, 2001; Crimi and Taylor, 2007). Both MTBE and benzene are 
highly recalcitrant under anoxic conditions (Häggblom et al., 2007; Foght, 2008). 
Due to the limitations of conventional groundwater cleanup technologies (e.g., 
pump-and-treat, air sparging), in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) has become one of the 
attractive remedial alternatives for petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater in 
recent years (Crimi and Taylor, 2007; Chen et al., 2009; Huling and Hwang, 2010). 
ISCO technology is an effective and potent groundwater remedial option, which is 
capable of breaking down many contaminants in solid or aqueous phases. During the 
pilot and field ISCO applications, hydrogen peroxide (Fenton’s reagent), permanganate 
(KMnO4), persulfate, and ozone (O3) are commonly used ISCO oxidants in these 
studies (Siedlecka and Stepnowski, 2007; Garoma et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2008; Chen 
et al., 2009; Forsey et al., 2010). 
Among the ISCO oxidants, persulfate is a promising new oxidant. It has a half-life 
of weeks to months in the subsurface (ITRC, 2005b; Osgerby, 2006). The oxidation-
reduction (redox) potential (ORP) of persulfate is about 2.01 V, which is higher than 
those of hydroxyl peroxide and permanganate but lower than those of hydroxyl radicals 
( OH) and ozone (Huang et al., 2002; ITRC, 2005‧ b). Persulfate can be activated 
thermally or chemically by initiators such as heat or transition metals [e.g., ferrous iron 
(Fe2+)] to produce more powerful sulfate free radicals (SO -4‧) (Block et al., 2004). 
Other activation methods include high or low pH and hydrogen peroxide (ITRC, 2005b; 
Liang et al., 2007): 
S2O -28  + initiator  2SO -4‧(or SO -4‧+SO -24 ) (1) 
SO -4‧ + e－  SO -24   E0 = 2.6 V (2) 
Sulfate free radicals are capable of degrading organic compounds to carbon

In this study, MTBE (99.97%, TEDIA Company Inc., Fairfield, Ohio) and benzene 
(99.97%, TEDIA Company Inc., Fairfield, Ohio), major components of gasoline, were 
selected as the COCs and target compounds. Persulfate was used as the oxidant for 
contaminant oxidation. Sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8, reagent grade, min. 99%, Riedel-
de Haen, Germany) and potassium persulfate (K2S2O8, reagent grade, min. 99%, J.T. 
Baker, U.S.A.) were selected for persulfate supplement. Ferrous sulfate (FeSO4 7 H‧ 2O, 
min. 99.5%, Riedel-de Haen, Germany) was used for ferrous iron supplement to 
activate persulfate oxidation. Cement (type I) and sand were used as the components of 
oxidant-releasing materials, which were obtained from Taiwan Cement Corp. In this 
study, regular medium sand with grain size of 0.4 to 2 mm was used to control the 
porosity and permeability of the mixture. 
 
2.2 Design of oxidant-releasing materials 
Preliminary laboratory studies were conducted to determine an appropriate 
composition of the mixture (Kuo, 2009). Results from our preliminary study show that 
the appropriate components of the oxidant-releasing material included oxidant, binding 
material, water, and solids with small diameters to create an appropriate porosity. In the 
preliminary study, bentonite powder and cement were tested for their feasibility on 
binding properties. Results indicate that cement was more cost-effective and performed 
well on component binding compared to bentonite powder. Thus, cement was used as 
the binding material in the following experiments. In this study, sodium persulfate (or 
potassium persulfate), cement, and sand were added in a 500-mL beaker, and distilled 
water was also gradually introduced into the beaker. Continuously mixing was 
performed for 15-20 min to ensure uniform distribution of those components in the 
mixture. Before the material was solidified, the pasty liquid was poured into a mold (4 
cm × 6 cm × 7 cm) and it was air-dried at room temperature (25 oC) for one day to form 
the solid oxidant-releasing material. The persulfate release rate experiments were 
performed in two-liter serum bottles. Each serum bottle contained one liter distilled 
water and an oxidant-releasing cube. Persulfate would be released from the cube when 
it contacted with water. Water samples were collected from the serum bottles 
periodically for persulfate concentration analyses, and the distilled water in each bottle 
was replaced daily. The persulfate release rate was calculated and recorded as mg 
S2O -28 /d/g of oxidant-releasing material versus time. 
 
2.3 Evaluation of the released persulfate on groundwater remediation  
In this study, column experiment was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of 
using the designed persulfate-releasing materials on contaminated groundwater 
remediation. A total of six continuous-flow glass columns were used to simulate the 
ISCO barrier system. Figure 1 shows the layout of the laboratory-scale column 
experiment. The developed system consisted of the first soil column followed by the 
oxidant-releasing material columns (the second and third columns), and the fourth to 
sixth columns (the second to fourth soil columns). Each column had a length of 25 cm 
with an inside diameter of 5 cm. The first column (soil column) was used to simulate 
the contaminated area located upgradient of the persulfate barrier. It was also used to 
equilibrate the feed solution before it reached the oxidation zone. The second and third 
columns (Fig. 1) were used to simulate the oxidant-releasing barrier and were filled 
with persulfate-releasing cubes for persulfate supplement when they contacted with 
water. Approximately 270 g of cube-shaped oxidant-releasing materials were placed in 
 13
groundwater were closely related. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is a number 
between -1 and 1, which measures the degree to which two variables are linearly related. 
It is a measure of the linear association between two variables that have been measured 
on interval or ratio scales. This method was performed for extraction of the variation of 
MTBE and benzene concentration versus the effluents in column experiment. 
 15
reported in Eq. 5. The produced sulfate radicals would oxidize contaminants (MTBE 
and benzene) in a very efficient way. The observed persulfate and ferrous iron 
concentrations in the sixth column effluents varied from 14,545 to 1,000 mg/L and 0.15 
to 77.5 mg/L, respectively, when 8.29 to 102.8 PVs of groundwater was pumped 
through the six-column system. The decreased persulfate concentrations indicate that 
persulfate release pattern reached the stabilized stage with a more constant release rate 
after approximately 94.51 PVs of groundwater pumping. Researchers reported that 
excessive ferrous iron might act as an intrinsic scavenger of sulfate radicals (Eq. 6) 
(Kolthoff and Miller, 1951; Buxton et al., 1997). This would cause the consumption of 
sulfate radicals. Therefore, ferrous iron concentrations should be controlled to prevent 
the reaction between ferrous iron and sulfate radical (Chen et al., 2009; Oh et al., 2009). 
Results from Liang et al. (2004) reveal that even though ferrous ion activated persulfate 
can quickly generate sulfate radicals for the destruction of trichloroethylene, incomplete 
trichloroethylene destruction would occur almost instantaneously and then reaction 
stalled. Thus, the destruction of sulfate radical could be due to (1) the presence of 
excess Fe2+, and (2) rapid conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+, which limits the oxidizing 
capability. 
Results from ORP measurements show that ORP values decreased dramatically 
from 718 to 604 mV after pumping with 0.39 to 72.7 PVs of groundwater (Fig. 3b). 
This could be attributed to the production of sulfate radicals (Chen et al., 2009). The 
observed persulfate concentrations and ORP values varied from 14,545 to 404 mg/L and 
771 to 490 mV after pumping with 8.29 to 102.8 PVs of groundwater, respectively. 
Results indicate that ORP measurement can be used as a quick indicating parameter for 
persulfate and sulfate radical in the subsurface during the ISCO process using persulfate 
as the oxidant. The variations in pH measurements versus flushed groundwater for the 
sixth column effluents are shown in Fig. 3c. The pH values varied from 7.24 to 1.63 
during the pumping period from 0.39 to 15.7 PVs. This demonstrates that the in situ 
persulfate oxidation process would cause the decrease in groundwater pH because of the 
production of sulfate and sulfuric acid shown in Eq. 5. In the future practical application, 
pH would not become an issue in the field due to the intrinsic groundwater buffering 
system (ITRC, 2005b). In the latter part of the operational period (15.7 to 102.8 PVs of 
pumping), increase in pH values from 1.63 to 5.6 was observed. This could be attributed 
to the decreased production of sulfuric acid in the latter operational period. The 
variations in sulfate concentrations versus PV in the sixth column effluents are 
presented in Fig. 3d. Results show that persulfate and sulfate concentration varied from 
0 to 14,545 mg/L and 145 to 10,530 mg/L during the pumping period from 0.39 to 8.29 
PVs, respectively. The observed persulfate and sulfate concentrations respectively 
varied from 14,545 to 400 mg/L and 10,530 to 569 mg/L during the pumping period 
from 8.29 to 102.8 PVs, respectively. Results from Fig. 3d presents a trend of the 
persulfate release from the oxidant-releasing materials and the decrease in persulfate 
and sulfate concentrations reveals that the material reached the latter part of the release 
pattern. 
The concentrations of MTBE, benzene, and their degradation byproducts versus PV 
for the effluents from the first to sixth columns were shown in Fig. 4. Insignificant 
removal of MTBE and benzene was observed from the first column effluents, indicating 
that the intrinsic biodegradability of MTBE and benzene was low under anoxic 
conditions. This matched with the results reported by Kao et al. (2008) and Chen et al. 
(2010) that MTBE and benzene had lower natural biodegradation rates compared to 
toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. Approximately 85.0% of MTBE and 98.8% of 
benzene were removed during the operational periods from 0.39 to 37.9 PVs, and 20.0% 
 17
ferrous iron-activated persulfate oxidation were approximately 86-92% and 95-99%, 
respectively, in the early stage (0 to 37.9 PVs) of the oxidation process.  
Table 3 presents the correlation coefficient matrix between MTBE and PV 
variables in the column experiment. Table 4 presents the correlation coefficient matrix 
between benzene and PV variables in the column experiment. The correlation matrix 
containing calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients was utilized to demonstrate 
relationships between variables. The obtained matrixes of MTBE and benzene 
concentration were subjected to multivariance analytical technique (Tables 3 and 4). 
There was no significant correlation between the first column effluent and the other 
column effluents (less than 0.05). The correlation matrix between chemical variables 
indicate that there was the highest correlation between the fourth and fifth column 
effluents (with correlation coefficient higher than 1.0) in the column experiment. The 
strongest correlation with MTBE and benzene degradation was obtained due to the 
persulfate release from the oxidant-releasing materials. 
To observe the surface change of the sodium type oxidant-releasing materials, 
ESEM technique was conducted. Figure 6 shows the ESEM images of the oxidant-
releasing material surface for the original material (before experiment) [Fig. 5a-1 (400X) 
and Fig. 5a-2 (1,000X)] and residual material (after experiment) [Fig. 5b-1 (400X) and 
Fig. 5b-2 (1,000X)]. ESEM results show that the sodium persulfate granules appeared in 
the material porosity after the experiment (Fig. 5b-1 and 5b-2). This indicates that 
sodium persulfate released from the material after contacted with water. The released 
persulfate would cause the contaminant oxidation in the water phase. The ESEM results 
verified the formation of micro-scale secondary capillary permeability through which 
persulfate can be released by a reaction-diffusion.
