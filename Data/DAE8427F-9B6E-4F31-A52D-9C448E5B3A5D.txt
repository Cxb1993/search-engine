Abstract 
Equipment capability and dedication are 
specific constraints of wafer fabrication.  
Photolithography is a critical process in 
wafer fabrication.  Meeting tolerances on 
the critical dimensions (e.g., line width) and 
alignment with the previous layers are 
critical to the manufacturing of ultra large 
scale integrated circuit (ULSI).  Therefore, 
it is a common practice to dedicate lots to the 
same photolithography equipment, i.e., to 
process all the layers of a given lot by the 
same equipment.  As a result, it is important 
to balance the loading among different 
machines with the same capability to 
improve the productivity.   
This project develops a capacity 
planning system (CPS) that integrates order 
assignment and load allocation considering 
equipment capability and dedication for 
semiconductor foundry companies that has 
multiple fabs with equipment of different 
capacity and capability.  Simulation can be 
used to evaluate the performance of CPS.  
Order assignment can efficiently balance the 
equipment workload among the various fabs, 
on various days at various levels of demands.  
Load allocation can effectively balance the 
loading among different machines with the 
same capability on the planning horizon by 
taking into account the order’s process 
requirements as well as the machine’s 
capacity, capability, and dedication 
constraints.  CPS can help semiconductor 
foundry companies to obtain better resource 
utilization, more balanced equipment loading 
among different fabs and also among 
different machines with the same capability, 
shorter manufacturing lead time, better 
on-time delivery, and lower work-in-process.   
Keywords: multiple wafer fab, order 
assignment, load allocation, capability, 
dedication 
二、緣由與目的

the most complex processes.  It is capital 
intensive and highly competitive.  In 
addition to the development of products and 
manufacturing technologies, operation 
 3
objective of OACD is to balance the loading 
among the various fabs, on various days, and 
across various equipment with the same 
capability at various levels of demands.

wafer fabs 
 
Philipoom et al. (1993) presented a 
capacity sensitive Order Review/Release 
(ORR) procedure called the path-based 
bottleneck (PBB).  The results reveal that 
PBB performs well when the due-date is 
tight.  Chen et al. (2004) developed a 
dynamic state-dependent dispatching (DSDD) 
heuristic for a wafer fabrication plant.  
DSDD dynamically uses different 
dispatching rules according to the state of a 
production system.  Simulation results 
demonstrate that DSDD obtains the best 
performance among the compared six 
dispatching rules in terms of average and 
standard deviation of cycle time and 
work-in-process.  Toba et al. (2005) 
proposed a load balancing method which 
balanced all processing operations of 
products among multiple semiconductor 
wafer fabs by using predictive scheduling 
results.  Results show that the proposed 
method enabled improved load balancing 
among multiple fabs. 
Akcalt et al. (2001) developed a 
simulation study considering machine 
dedication.  Results show machine 
dedication significantly increases both the 
average and the variability of the cycle time.  
Chung and Huang (2001) developed a 
Capability-Oriented Loading Allocation 
algorithm (COLA) for wafer fab without 
considering the equipment dedication.  
Simulation experiment shows that the 
loading leveling is achieved through the 
COLA algorithm.  Iwata and Wood (2002) 
developed a simple equation-based model of 
wafer cost to show the influence with 
dedicating tools to eliminate setups.  
Results show that the wafer processing cost 
for the dedicated case is much higher than 
the cost for the cases with setups.  Chen et 
al. (2005) developed an infinite capacity 
requirements planning (ICRP) considering 
the capability of equipment type for multiple 
semiconductor manufacturing fabs with the 
same processing time at the same equipment.  
Simulation results show that ICRP based on 
the combination of Adjusted Release Time 
and Path Load (PL) can efficiently balance 
the equipment workload among various fabs, 
on various days, and across various 
equipment at various levels of demands.   
Chung et al. (2006) proposed an integer 
programming model to solve the capacity

Step 7. 
Step 3. WRM: A new lot will be released if 
the WIP cannot meet the MPS 
requirement. 
Step 4. Calculate the Latest Release Time 
(LRT) of the released lot (denoted by 
WIP w) satisfying MPSp(t) 
Step 5. Calculate the Estimated Loading 
(ELk,t,f) of the bottleneck equipment 
type k on the WIP w’s route for 
product p if WIP w is released in 
time bucket t (t=LRT, LRT-1,…, 1) at 
fab f.  Two cases are considered 
herein. 
Case 1. If PL is applied to OA, Total 
estimated Loading Ratio (TLRw,t,f) 
of WIP w needs to calculate along 
the process path of WIP w, if it is 
released at time bucket t (i.e., 
PSTw(1) equals to t) of fab f. 
Case 2. If SL is applied to OA, TLRw,t,f needs 
to take into account the loading of 
all orders at fab f 
Step 6. The day t and fab f with the minimum 
TLRw,t,f  is selected as the release 
time and the start fab of WIP w. 
Step 7. WAM: Accumulate the equipment 
type loading to corresponding time 
buckets, fabs, and equipment types. 
Step 8. If any unsatisfied MPS requirement 
exists, go to Step 2. 
Step 9. Compute the related performance 
indices.  Go to EA. 
3.1.2 Equipment allocation (EA) 
After the release time and start fab are 
determined by OA, EA will be used to select 
the equipment used to process the specific 
capability of these orders.   
EA includes three modules-Order 
Priority Module (OPM), Equipment 
Assignment Module (EAM), and Workload 
Accumulation Module (WAM).  Based on 
the release time and start fab determined by 
OA, EA then selects a machine to process an 
operation with capability and dedication.   
When LR is applied, the required 
loading of three orders must be included.  
When PL is applied, one of the orders needs 
to be selected using First-In First-Out (FIFO).  
Future demand loading ratio of each machine 
is considered only if Loading Ratio (LR) is 
applied.  No future demand loading ratio of 
each machine is considered when PL is 
applied.  EA algorithm comprises the 
following steps: 
Step 1. Read in all orders requiring 
equipment capability and dedication. 
Step 2. OPM: Order priority can be decided 
in two ways.  When PL is applied, 
FIFO is used to select the order (SR) 
and then go to step 6 to select 
machine.  When LR is applied, 
Steps 3-5 are used to select the order 
(SR). 
Step 3. Calculate the machines’ Total 
Available Capacity for each order r 
(TACr) with respect to this order’s 
capability c and corresponding days 
D(r). 
Step 4. Calculate the Total Required 
Capacity for each order r (TRCr). 
Step 5. The order (SR) with the maximum 
TRCr/TACr is selected. 
Step 6. EAM: Equipment assignment can be 
determined using PL or LR.  EAM 
using PL calculates only the loading 
of the machine and corresponding 
time buckets that is on the process 
route of SR.  Except for the loading 
of SR, the demand loading of other 
orders that can be processed by the 
machine in the corresponding time 
buckets is considered if EAM uses 
LR. 
Case 1. If LR is applied to EAM, LR of 
each machine k (LRk) that can 
process the order SR can be 
calculated by taking into account 
the demand loading and the 
 7
different equipment that can process the 
same capabilities, including standard 
deviation of machine loading, MAD of EUm,k, 
and MAD of EUd,k.  Standard deviation of 
machine loading can show the effect of load 
balance among all machines, while MAD of 
EUf,m,k and MAD of EUf,d,k can show the 
effect of load balance among the machines 
with the same capability.

Simulation is used to evaluate the 
performance of OACD.  Data from a real 
foundry fab in Taiwan are collected and used 
in the simulation model.   
3.3 Results and discussion 
The simulation results are analyzed 
using descriptive statistics and analysis of 
variance (ANOVA).  All ANOVA are run 
using SPSS.  The significance level for all 
statistical analyses is 0.05.  Outputs of days 
31 to 60 are collected to analysis.  All main 
effects are significant in all general 
performance measures.  These results 
demonstrate that the factors of MPS 
frequency and MPS variation of 
experimental design can simulate the 
variation in demands.  
Table 2 shows the effect of OA in the 
general performance indices.  PL, SL and 
Random are classified as the first, second and 
third Duncan’s groups, respectively, 
revealing significant statistical difference 
among these levels in terms of all three 
general performance indices.  This finding 
indicates the proposed PL of OA effectively 
balances the workload across various 
equipment types among different fabs and 
different days.

Both PL and SL outperform Random.  
This demonstrates that the consideration of 
equipment loading leads to better 
performance than that obtained using 
Random.  However, PL outperforms SL in 
all instances because PL considers only the 
equipment types on the routing and the time 
buckets associated with the equipment types, 
while SL considers all the equipment types in 
the fab over the full planning horizon.   
In terms of capability-related 
performance indices, all main effects are 
significant in terms of the standard deviation 
of machine loading and MAD of EUd,k
