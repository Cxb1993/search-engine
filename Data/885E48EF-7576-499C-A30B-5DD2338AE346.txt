ics Rmanufacturing system [6], software-implemented shutdown
system of the nuclear power plants [8], and chemical and
aviation industries [5,9].
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the development of
more complex integrated circuit chips by the electronics
industry made it clear that fault coverage deﬁned as the
percentage of the faults that will be detected during board
test became the key element examined to determine the reli-
ability of a particular process [10,11]. Due to the continu-
ous increase in demand for higher quality electronic
products, the problem of printed circuit board assembly
(PCBA) reliability has been a critical topic.
In conventional fault-tree analysis, we must fully under-
stand the process, which is assumed that exact probabilities
of events are given. In addition, we should have plenty of
experience on the manufacturing process operation and
maintenance and many data of failures should be collected
before FTA. Otherwise, some important events may be
omitted during the fault-tree construction, which may lead
to incorrect results.
However, it is often diﬃcult to obtain past failure data
because the environmental change of process and FTA is
made at early design stage, especially, we often need to
use new components that have not failure data. Further-
more, in real system/process, the information is inaccuracy
and supposed to linguistic representation, the estimation of
precise values of possibility becomes very diﬃcult in many
cases. In order to handle the uncertain situation and insuf-
ﬁcient information, the fuzzy approach is used to evaluate
the failure rate status. A great deal of literature works [12],
Mon and Cheng [13,14] has been carried out in fuzzy reli-
able analysis.
Some authors tried to apply fuzzy sets theory to FTA.
Tanaka et al. [15] and Singer [16] studied fault-tree analy-
sis using fuzzy set theory. Tanaka et al. [15] proposed the
way to obtain fuzzy sets of system failure when member-
ship functions of components are known. Singer [16] pro-
posed a method using fuzzy numbers to represent the
relative frequencies of the basic events. He has shown
the use of n-array possibilistic AND, OR, and NEG oper-
ators to construct possible fault tree. Tsujimura and Gen
[17] proposed the concept of the importance used in the
fuzzy fault tree that the basic events were considered as
fuzzy number. Fuzzy possibility was proposed by Walley
[18,19], and then there were some approaches about fuzzy
fault-tree analysis being introduced in Suresh et al. [20]
and Antonio et al. [21].
The concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) can be
viewed as an alternative approach to deﬁne a fuzzy set
in cases where available information is not suﬃcient for
the deﬁnition of an imprecise concept by means of a con-
ventional fuzzy set. Fuzzy sets are IFSs but the converse
is not necessarily true [22,23]. In fact, Biswas [24] pointed
out that there were situations where IFS theory is more
appropriate to deal with. Bustince and Burillo [25] showed
2140 M.-H. Shu et al. / Microelectronthat the notion of vague sets coincides with that of
intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Therefore, it is expected thatintuitionistic fuzzy sets could be used to simulate any
activities and processes requiring human expertise and
knowledge, which are inevitably imprecise or not totally
reliable. IFS theory has been applied in diﬀerent areas
such as logic programming [26,27], decision-making prob-
lems [28–31], in medical diagnosis [32], and pattern recog-
nitions [33].
In the printed circuit board (PCB) industry that requires
hundreds or thousands of assembly operations are not
uncommon in the manufacture of today’s electronic prod-
ucts. Consumers of these products are also demanding
higher quality and more reliable items [34]. Under these cir-
cumstances, greater control is necessary over the manufac-
turing processes used to produce printed circuit boards
(PCBs). There are three major fault classes: manufacturing
faults, performance faults, human factors and speciﬁcation
faults [35]. In some circumstances, the experts can develop
the fault tree for one kind of product, but it is diﬃcult to
rule out the exact failure possibility on PCBA failures.
Sometimes, expert opinion is used to provide the fault
information, but estimates usually are uncertain and the
representations are supposed to be using linguistic. More-
over, they cannot express the fuzziness under conﬁrmable
conﬁdence level when a new type of product is developed.
It usually occurs in electronics products, because the new
type of PCBA is usually based on previous product, and
a lot of factors would inﬂuence PCBA operation, but these
factors usually have some uncertainty and linguistic ambi-
guity. Therefore, we suggest using IFS to evaluate PCBA
reliability problems.
This paper is organized in ﬁve sections. Section 2 dis-
cusses deﬁnition of intuitionistic fuzzy set and its opera-
tions. Section 3 proposes a new approach for intuitionistic
fuzzy fault-tree analysis, and represents an algorithm of
intuitionistic fuzzy fault-tree analysis. PCBA is used to illus-
trate the algorithm of intuitionistic fuzzy fault-tree analysis
and some comparisons with the existing approaches are dis-
cussed in Section 4. The ﬁnal section makes conclusions.
2. Intuitionistic fuzzy set and its operations
In this section, we introduce the deﬁnitions and proper-
ties of intuitionistic fuzzy set, and four arithmetic opera-
tions of triangle intuitionistic fuzzy set. We also deﬁne
the set operations of intuitionistic fuzzy set based on Ata-
nassov’s [22,23] deﬁnitions.
2.1. Intuitionistic fuzzy set theory
Zadeh [36] proposed fuzzy sets to describe situations in
which the data are imprecise or vague. Fuzzy set theory has
been shown to be a useful tool to handle such situations by
attributing a degree to which a certain object belongs to a
set. In real life, a person may assume that an object belongs
to a set to a certain degree, but it is possible that he is not
eliability 46 (2006) 2139–2148so sure about it. In other words, there may be a hesitation
or uncertainty about the membership degree of in A. In

3. Proposed intuitionistic fuzzy fault-tree analysis
For implementing IFS in fault-tree analysis, we deﬁne
the ‘‘and’’ and ‘‘or’’ operation as Deﬁnitions 3.1 and 3.2,
respectively. The deﬁnitions will be used in the intuitionis-
tic fuzzy fault-tree analysis based on Eqs. (3)–(6) and Def-
inition 2.2.
Deﬁnition 3.1. The ‘‘and’’ operation of two IFSs A ¼
h½a01; b1; c01Þ; uA; ½ða1; b1; c1Þ; vAi and B ¼ h½a02; b2; c02Þ; uB;

In the fault-tree analysis [2], the ‘‘or’’ operation for deal-
ing with failure possibility of two fault events X [ Y is cal-
culated by
F ðX [ Y Þ ¼ 1 ð1 F ðX ÞÞð1 F ðY ÞÞ ð11Þ
where F(X [ Y), F(X), and F(Y) represent the failure possi-
bilities of event X [ Y, X, and Y, respectively. So, we deﬁne
the ‘‘or’’ operation which will be used in the intuitionistic
fuzzy fault-tree analysis as
Deﬁnition 3.2. Let A ¼ h½a01; b1; c01Þ; uA; ½ða1; b1; c1Þ; vAi and
B ¼ h½a02; b2; c02Þ; uB; ½a2; b2; c2Þ; vBi are two IFSs, then the
failure possibilities of A [ B can be deﬁned as

The reliability interval of top event is equal to one

2144 M.-H. Shu et al. / MicroelectronOnce a uniform temperature is achieved across the
board the temperature is increased again so that reﬂow
(the process of melting the solder paste on the printed cir-
cuit board to provide electrical connectivity and hold
components) occurs uniformly [35]. In the fourth phase
the PCBs wait in the buﬀer storage and pass a manual
insertion phase in which some large components are
inserted, then ﬁnally the board is passing over molten
solder alloy to make the connections. After these phases,
automated optical inspection (AOI) provides in PCB
production environment automation to detect defectives
and maintain quality. The large number of operations
that are required for producing PCBs make the process
very complex and therefore high failure rates are expected
[42].

to the process in Section 4.1 and the knowledge captured
from the mid-sized manufacturing factory located in sci-
ence-based Industrial park at Hsinchu, Taiwan. The

In Fig. 5, the symbols ‘‘ ’’ and ‘‘ ’’ represent the
‘‘or’’ and ‘‘and’’ operations in fault-tree analysis, respec-
tively. For example, the fault event ‘‘IC lead bend (A)’’ is
the union of events A1, A2, and A3 (i.e. ‘‘Insuﬃcient
IQC sampling’’, ‘‘Mixed up failure ICs from vendors’’,
and ‘‘Bad handling operation’’). Then, according to
Fig. 5, the fault-tree diagram of ‘‘PCBA Fault’’ can be rep-
resented as [2]

where \ means relation of parallel (i.e. ‘‘and’’ operation)
and [ means series (i.e. ‘‘or’’ operation).
Let qi represent the failure possibility of bottom event
i, then the possibility of ‘‘PCBA Fault’’ can describe as [2]:
4.4. Intuitionistic fault-tree analysis
We calculated the failure interval (by IFSs) of ‘‘PCBA
Fault’’ based on Eq. (15) and the deﬁnitions in Section 3
(Deﬁnitions 3.1 and 3.2). The ‘‘and’’ operation (\) of two
IFSs can be divided into ‘‘and-by-product’’ or ‘‘and-by-
min’’ (ref. Deﬁnition 3.1), and the ‘‘or’’ operation ([) is
deﬁned as Deﬁnition 3.2. The results of proposed intuition-
istic fuzzy fault-tree analysis are
1. ‘‘and-by-product’’:
qPCB Fault ¼ qT ¼ h½ð0:0439; 0:0554; 0:0646Þ; 0:6;
½ð0:0344; 0:0554; 0:0742Þ; 0:7i
2. ‘‘and-by-min’’:
qPCB Fault ¼ qT ¼ h½ð0:0477; 0:0601; 0:0701Þ; 0:6;
½ð0:0377; 0:0601; 0:0799Þ; 0:7i
For obtaining the most signiﬁcant event of ‘‘PCBA
Fault’’, we calculate the diﬀerence in intuitionistic fuzzy
failure between overall fault-tree and deleted the nodes in
second level (denoted as V ðqT ; qT iÞ, i = A,B, . . . ,S) accord-
ing to Deﬁnition 3.3, and the results are shown in Table 4.
The most signiﬁcant failure event is event ‘‘Printing half-
tone’’ (i.e. event ‘‘I’’) according to the ranking in Table 4.

Let X I ,  X ,  ,..., X, be a random sample of size 
n form a normal distributed process 
N(p,rnZ) .  Boyles [2] proposed the following 
estimator of Cpm 
where d = (USL-LSL)/~  is half of the 
length of the specification interval, 
- 
X = x = , ~ l n  and $ = ~ ( X . - ~ l n .  -I 
However, it is not uncommon that the 
real observations of conti~luous quantities are 
not precise numbers but more or less 
non-precise, thus some fuzzy set theory, as 
developed by Zadeh ([30] [31] [32] [33) will be 
applied to obtain a more realistic approach. In 
the following sections, we first review fuzzy 
sets and fuzzy binary preference relations, 
then the fuzzy testing and selecting 
manufacturing/supplier processes using C,, 
will also be proposed. 
3. Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Binary 
Preference Relations 
Let U be a reference set, a fuzzy subset 
2 of U is defined by a membership 
function p;, : U + [0,1] , where p;, ( x ) - ,  
b'x E U , is the membership function for A 
evaluated a real number x indicating the 
degree to which x -  belongs to 2 . 
Defmition 1. Let A be a normal and convex 
fuzzy subset of U with piecewise continuous 
membership function p-  ( x )  . 
(a) Define p2 [a] = Ixlp;, ( x )  2 a )  as an 
a-cut of 2 which is a closed, bounded, 
interval for 0 < a  5 1  . pi [0] is separately 
defined as the closure of the union of all 
pa [a1 . (b) Define I;, ( a )  = inf x E p 2 [ n l  ( x )  as - the lower 
bound of the a -cut of A , and 
y;, ( a )  = s ~ p ~ ~ ~ . [ , ~ ( x )  as the upper bound of 
the a-cut ofP A .  
Definition 2. A fuzzy binary preference 
relation R on U is a fuzzy subset of 
U x U  with the membership function 
2 ,  , ' ~ A , B E u  , where pRu,(A,B) 
rep&sents the truth level or the strength bf the 
relation between 2 and B in a ordered 
pair ( 2 , B )  . p, ( 2 , ~ )  = 1 means that the 
relation is true or the strongest, and 
p, (R ,B)  = O means that the relatGn is false 
or the weakness. 
4. Buckley's Approach for Fuzzy 
Estimation 
We refer to Buckley's approach (Buckley 
([3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]) and Buckley [9] to obtain 
fuzzy numbers based on a set of confidence 
intervals. A ( 1  - Q )  100% confidence interval 
for 6 is required to compute. Q is used in 
this paper, since a is usually employed for 
confidence intervals and reserved for a -cuts 
of fuzzy numbers. In this confidence interval, 
one usually sets Q equal to 0.01, 0.05, or 
0.1. 
We propose to find the (1-P)100% 
confidence interval for all 0.01 5 P <  1 . 
Starting at 0.01 is arbitrary and you could 
begin at 0.001 or 0.005 etc. Denote these 
confidence intervals as [B, ( P ) ,  6, ( P )  for 
0.01 5 Q < 1 . Add to this the interval {8,8] 
for the 0% confidence intervals for 8 .  Then 
we have ( 1  - P )  100% confidence interval for 
6 for 0.01 S Q < 1.  
Now place these confidence intervals, 
one on top of the other, to ppduce a 
triangular shaped fuzzy number 6 whose 
a -cuts are the confidence intervals. We 
have 6* [a] = [ l ,  (a),yi (a)]  . for 0.01 < a < 1 . 
All that is neecfed is to fin~sh the "bottom" of 
B to make it a complete fuzzy number. We 
will simply drop the graph of 6 straight 
down to complete its a -cuts so 
6' [a] = [ I ,  ( o . o ~ ) , ,  ( o . o ~ ) ]  for o 5 a < 0.01 . 
In this way we are using more information in 
6 than just a point estimate 6 ,  or just a 
single interval estimate [el (Q),8, (Q)]  . 
4.1. Cuts of Fuzzy Estimations for C,, 
By the inspiration of Buckley's approach 
([7] [8]), we first establish the fuzzy situation of 
sample mean X and sample variance S2 , 
then proceed to cuts of fuzzy estimations for 
C,, . The triangular shaped fuzzy numbe~s 
with a-cuts of fuzzy estimate X and s2 
are as follows: 
where t,-,,, ,,-, is the 1-a/2 percentile of 
the t distribution with n-1 degrees of 
freedom and Xil,,n.., is the a / 2  percentile 
of the ordinary central Chi-square with n-1 
degrees of freedom. In or+r to,obtain the 
a - cuts of fuzzy number C,, , c;, [a] , we 
perform the -calculation by a -cuts . 
Choosing a EX*  [a] and b E S2* [ a ]  , we 
can obtain
