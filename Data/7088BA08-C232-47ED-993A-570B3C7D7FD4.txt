Abstract 
Use of galvanized rebar is one of conventional protection methods for preventing reinforced 
concrete (RC) structures from corrosion damage.  The inefficiency of zinc-coated reinforcing steel 
exposed to chloride-ion contaminated environment has been reported and several investigations also 
indicated the addition of aluminum in galvanizing bath to produce zinc-aluminum alloy coating 
could improve the corrosion resistance of hot-dipped rebars even subjected to severe exposure 
conditions.  Zinc-aluminum alloy coating consists of beta phase compound, aluminum-rich 
compound and Fe-Al-Zn alloy.  Hot-dipped rebars were produced following the specifications of 
ASTM A767-05 and ASTM A875-05 and immersed in the alkaline and chloride ion contaminated 
solutions in this study.  The microstructure and electrochemical behavior of rebars exposed to 
various environments were investigated.  The cross-sectional morphology of coated rebar and 
potentiodynamic polarization curves were determined by BEI/EDS/SEM and potentiostat.  Test 
results indicate the thickness of zinc-aluminum coating and zinc coating are about 30 and 100 µm 
and the corrosion potential of ZA rebar immersed in chloride ion solution is lower than those of ZR 
and untreated rebars, however, its corrosion current and corrosion rate are in the middle. The 
coating could rapidly deteriorate if conventional ZR rebar is exposed to pH12~13 solutions with 
chloride ion concentration exceeding 1.0 wt.%.  Under chloride-ion attack, the corrosion rates of

Surface properties of treated rebars 
The specimen was transversely cut from the coated rebar and the cross-sectional surface was 
polished before conducting property analysis.  The morphology of cross section, coating thickness, 
element mapping, micrographs, and hardness were evaluated using backscattered electron imaging 
(BEI, Hitachi S-4800) , EDS analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), and 
micro hardness tester (Mitutoyo MVK-G1), respectively.   
 
Corrosion tests  
Corrosion of rebar specimen was tested by conducting potentiodynamic polarization and open 
circuit potential measurement using a potentiostat with an electrochemical interface (Schlumberger 
SI 1286).  The coated rebar specimens and untreated rebar, specimens with an exposure area of 6 
cm2 were immersed in simulating concrete pore solutions.  The pH value of solutions were 7, 9, 11, 
and 12.8 produced by mixing solvable Ca(OH)2 in  water.  In addition, various chloride ion 
concentrations of 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.5 wt.% were arranged in the solutions as well to simulate 
chloride-ion contaminated environment.  Open circuit potential was measured firstly and then 
potentialdynamic polarization test was conducted.  The reference electrode was saturated calomel 
electrode (SCE).  The potential scan ranged from 0.5 volt below open circuit potential to 0.5 volt 
above reference potential and the scan rate was set at 1 mV/sec.  According to the Test Method of 
ASTM G5-94 (2004) and the Practice of ASTM G59-97 (2003), corrosion potential (Ecorr, mV) and 
corrosion current (icorr, A/cm2) could be obtained from galvanic cell and polarization measurements 
(Tafel extrapolations and polarization resistance measurement).  The corrosion rate (corr. rate, mpy) 
can be computed from corrosion based on the method specified in ASTM G102-89 (2004).  The 
behavior could be assessed by the potential curves.  The oxide or passive film product of testing 
specimen was also analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Siemens D-5000) pattern.

Figs 5 and 6 illustrate the BEI micrographs and EDS mapping analysis result of cross section of 
zinc-aluminum alloy coated rebar, respectively.  The thickness of zinc-aluminum alloy coating is 
about 70 µm less than zinc coating but zinc-aluminum alloy coating appears to be denser as shown 
in Fig. 7.  The composition of ZA coating major consists of zinc and aluminum as demonstrated in 
Fig. 6.  The denser structure and less thickness of zinc-aluminum alloy coating could be 
advantageous for minimizing micro-cracks resulting from cold working.

The OCP of ZA rebar immersed in pH 12.8 solution mixed with 3.5 wt.% chloride ions  sharply 
drops from -1020mv to -1320mv as shown in Fig. 9.   The OCPs of ZA and ZR rebars are about 
520mv~590mv lower than those of untreated rebars in various pH solutions because Zn or Zn-Al is 
more active than Fe.   The OCPs of ZR specimens are around -1000mv with or without chloride 
ions in the solutions.  The chloride ion and alkalinity (pH<11) appear no significant effect on Zn or 
Zn-Al coating.

Polarization curves 
Potentialdynamic polarization curves are divided into two groups as passivation group and active 
group as illustrated in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, respectively.  The ZA specimens immersed in high pH 
solution appear to be significantly passivated even with high chloride ion concentration.  When the 
pH value in solution increases to 12.8, the corrosion potential would decrease 340mv~760mv to 
produce stable passive film on the surface.  As shown in Fig. 10, the polarization curves shift to 
corrosion currents (icorr) and corrosion rates are in between.  As illustrated in Fig. 12, when 
chloride ion concentration in pH 9 solution exceeds 2.0 wt.%, ZR specimen has lowest corrosion 
rate.  By immersing the specimens in pH 7~9 solutions with 1.0 wt.% chloride ion concentration, 
the corrosion rates are about the same for ZA and untreated specimens but ZR specimen has highest 
value.

Fig. 12 Relationship of corrosion rate, pH value and chloride ion concentration 
 
The corrosion rate of ZR specimen rapidly increases as the chloride ion concentration increases 
from 1.0 to 2.0 wt.% in pH 7 and 11 solutions.   In contrast to ZR specimen, the corrosion rate of 
ZA specimen increases fairly with the change of chloride ion concentration from 1.0 to 3.5 wt.%  
in pH solutions.  By considering chloride-ion effect on rebar corrosion, the corrosion rate of 
zinc-aluminum alloy coating is 10~57% less than conventional zinc coating in  pH 7, 9 and 11 
environments and zinc coating would corrode rapidly if chloride ion concentration exceeds 1.0 
wt.%. 
 
Micrographs of surface oxide 
Fig. 13 shows a macro appearance and micrographs of ZA rebar after immersed in pH 12.8 solution 
with 3.5 wt.% chloride ion concentration.  By comparing exposed area (A) with unexposed area 
(B), it appears that corrosive product of zinc-aluminum alloy becomes white and fine crystal and 
expansive product is observed in microscopies.  The white crystal oxides are analyzed were 
removed the ZR rebar, and compositions were carried out, as shown by EDS and XRD analysis in 
Fig. 14.  In the present analysis of EDS, the compositions of oxide were detected in 34.8, 4.0, 10.6, 
5.2, and 45.4 wt.% of O, Al, Cl, Ca, and Zn elements, respectively.  Therefore, this pattern reveals 
that the corrosion products in ZR surface mainly consist of Zn(OH)2 and less others of ZnO and 
Al2O3.
