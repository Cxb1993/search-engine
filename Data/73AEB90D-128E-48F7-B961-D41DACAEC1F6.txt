The current study analyzed these 255 electrical fatalities of construction industry. 
Similar to our previous analysis of fatal falls, each electrical fatality was analyzed in 
terms of individual factors (age, gender, experience of the victim), task factors 
(performing tasks), environmental factors (wet area and confined space), management 
factors (company size measured by number of workers), source of injury, and causes for 
these accidents. These electrocution accidents were divided into five accident patterns: 
(1) direct workers contact with an energized power line (41 cases, 16.1%), (2) boomed 
vehicle contact with an energized power line (36 cases, 14.1%), (3) conductive 
equipment contact with an energized power line (19 cases, 7.5%), (4) direct workers 
contact with an energized equipment (53 cases, 20.8%), (5) improperly installed or 
damaged equipment (101 cases, 39.6%), and other unclassified (5 cases, 2.0%) to 
identify contributing factors for each. For each accidents pattern, accident causes (fail to

四、研究結果 
根據每個變數的次數分析可以看出各類別的分佈狀況。主要的罹災者以男性
居多(254,99.6%)、年齡小於 34 歲(148,58.0%)、罹災者多數受雇於人數少於 30 人
的小公司(226,88.6%)、工作經少於 1 年(182,71.4%)。 
再加上SMR的比較可以根據SMR95%的信賴區間比較各個水準是否有顯著差
異。由 SMR 分析中可看出性別、分析中可看出性別與公司規模都有顯著差異。 
從營造業性別的 SMR 比較中顯示男性(SMR=1.55)發生感電重大職災的比例
顯著高於女性(SMR=0.01)。這樣的結果與 Chi 及 Chen(2003)的研究相同，男性發
生職災的比例在營造業顯著偏高。這樣的結果有可能是因為女性的工作時數較少
(Messing et al., 1994)，且較少從事戶外工作以及危險性較高的作業(Lucas,1974)。 
公司雇用人數的母體資料是根據民國 90 年勞工保險統計年報的公布資料。公
司雇用人數 SMR 結果與 Buskin 及 Paulozzi(1987)得到的結果類似，公司雇用人數
較多的大公司其感電職災的發生率顯著降低，小公司其危險性較高的原因可能是
小公司無法提供完整的安全訓練及安全教育人員，也有可能是小公司都承接危險
性較高的工作(Buskin & Paulozzi, 1987)。各因素的次數分析大多數的罹災者工
作經驗少於 1年(182,71.4%)，這樣的結果與(Chi & Wu, 1997)的研究相同，工作
經驗不足的人較容易發生感電職災。 
而危害類型的部份，將 255 件個案依 Casini (1993)的分類法歸為 6 種類型。分
別是勞工直接碰觸高壓電線(41, 16.1%)、車輛碰觸高壓電線(36, 14.1%)、傳導性工
 6
素三項主要原因。 
與傳導性工具碰觸高壓電線呈現正相關的發生原因為未保持安全距離
(φ=0.551, pf<0.001)。可知與傳導性工具碰觸高壓電線的危害類型相關的主要發生
原因為未保持安全距離。 
與碰觸帶電之設備呈現正相關的發生原因為未完成斷電程序(φ=0.216, 
pf=0.003)、未使用適當防護具與防護裝備(φ=0.277, pf<0.001)、碰觸帶電的設備
(φ=0.452, pf<0.001)、未使用適當防護具與防護裝備且碰觸帶電的設備(φ=0.213, 
pf=0.009)、不安全的作業行為且碰觸帶電的設備(φ=0.169, pf=0.029)。可得知與碰

Abstract 
Electrical fatality accounted for 14.6% of all fatal accidents and was the second leading cause of 
occupational fatality in Taiwan following the falling fatalities (Chi & Wu, 1997). Based on our study of 423 
electrical fatalities from the years 1996 to 2002, construction industry had 255 fatal electrocutions and accounted 
for 60% of the total number of electrical fatalities. Other than fatal falls, electrical fatality is another leading 
cause of occupational fatality in the construction industry. The current study analyzed these 255 electrical 
fatalities of construction industry. Similar to our previous analysis of fatal falls, each electrical fatality was 
analyzed in terms of individual factors (age, gender, experience of the victim), task factors (performing tasks), 
environmental factors (voltage, humidity, season of occurrence), management factors (company size measured 
by number of workers), agency of the accident, and causes for these accidents. A framework for the analysis was 
developed, based on the US Department of Labor’s categories and several other researches for electrical fatalities 
and Drury and Brill’s (1983) scenario analysis. These electrocution accidents were divided six accident patterns 
(Casini, 1993): (1) direct workers contact with an energized power line (47 cases, 18.4%), (2) boomed vehicle 
contact with an energized power line (36 cases, 14.1%), (3) conductive equipment contact with an energized 
power line (18 cases, 7.1%), (4) direct workers contact with an energized equipment (42 cases, 16.5%), (5) 
improperly installed or damaged equipment (107 cases, 42.2%) and others (5 cases, 2.0%) to identify 
contributing factors for each.  Contributing factors and prevention measures for each accident patterns were 
derived based on the association between contributing factors and accident patterns. The result from the analysis 
could lead to more effective safety training, protective equipment and devices, and compliance with established 
procedures.

1. Introduction 
In Taiwan, approximately 50-80 workers died 
from electrical fatalities each year which accounted 
for 14.6% of all occupational fatalities following 
falls which contributed to more than 30% of all work 
related fatalities (Chi & Wu, 1997). The average 
annual incidence rate--0.89 per 100,000 workers was 
relatively high as compared to 0.4 in U.S (Kisner & 
Casini, 1998) and 0.49 in Australia (Harvey-Sutton, 
et al 1992) indicating that occupational electrical 
fatal injury is a significant problem.  
Based on our study of 423 electrical fatalities 
from the years 1996 to 2002, construction industry 
had 255 fatal electrocutions and accounted for 60% 
of the total number of electrical fatalities. Other than 
fatal falls, electrical fatality is another leading cause 
of occupational fatality in the construction industry. 
The current study analyzed these 255 electrical 
fatalities of construction industry based on adapted 
model of Haddon’s method as described in Pineault, 
Rossignal, & Barr (1994) to target intervention 
efforts and identify further study need. Each 
occupational electrical accident was analyzed into (1) 
victim (age, gender, seniority, performing task, body 
part affected and nature of injury, type of contact), (2) 
vehicles, equipment, and material (3) physical 
environment (month and weather, electrical source 
and voltage, working height), and (4) social 
professional environment (industry, company size 
and training). Occupational electrocution fatalities 
were divided into five accident patterns: (1) direct 
workers contact with an energized power line, (2) 
boomed vehicle contact with an energized power line, 
(3) conductive equipment contact with an energized 
power line, (4) direct workers contact with an 
energized equipment, (5) improperly installed or 
damaged equipment based on Casini (1993).  
For each fatality accident, source of contact was 
identified according to MaCann, Hunting, Murawski, 
Chowdhury and Welch (2003) and classified into 
appliances/machinery, powerlines (overhead, buried 
and live rails, Ore & Casini (1996)), electrical 
equipment (electrical control panels, switch boxes, 
and transformers), energized objects (ladder, scaffold 
 1 4
Senchaudhuri, 1992).  
3. Results 
 
3.1 Frequency distribution of variables 
Frequency analysis was performed on each 
coded variable of the 255 occupational electrical 
fatalities in Taiwan between 1996 and 2002. 
Majority of victims in construction industry were 
male (254 , 99.6%), less than 34 years old (148, 
58.0%), worked for companies with less than 30 
workers (226, 88.6%)(Table 1), and had less than 1 
year of work experience (182, 71.4%) (Table 2).  
 The SMRs of various population segments were 
taken to be significantly different when the 95% 
confidence intervals of their SMRs did not overlap 
(Chi & Chen, 2003). Significant differences in SMR 
were found among different industry, gender, age 
and company size groups. Different categories, 
according to the SMRs, are indicated by alphabetical 
letters (Table 1). 
Similar to the previous finding in Chi & Wu 
(1997 & 2003), male workers had a greater number 
of electric shock fatalities than their female 
counterparts, and fatality rate of electric shock 
declined significantly with age. Possible reasons for 
the difference may be female worker are seldom 
employed in jobs with hazardous conditions (Lucas; 
1974).  The frequency distribution of experience 
seemed to confirm that young workers (< 24 years 
old) were suspected to suffer electric shock due to 
their lack of experience (Chi & Wu, 1997). 
Regarding the number of workers, there was a 
significantly increasing SMR with decreasing 
company size (p<0.001) as with Buskin and 
Paulozzi (1987). Other researchers also found that 
more than one third of electrocution cases occurred 
in smaller organizations, e.g., establishments that 
employed less than 50 workers (Casini,1993) and 
firms with fewer than 11 employees (Suruda & 
Smith, 1992), respectively. Possible reasons for the 
greater risk with decreasing company size could be 
due to smaller companies’ inability to afford safety 
programs and personnel, or because smaller 
companies are less likely to be inspected by relevant 
government agencies and often perform inherently 
riskier work (Buskin & Paulozzi, 1987). Our 
previous study on falling fatalities had similar result 
for company size (Chi, Chang and Ting, 2005). 
The 255 electrocution fatalities were divided six 
accident patterns as in Casini (1993) to identify 
potential contributing factors for each accident 
pattern. Improperly installed or damaged equipment 
(107 cases, 42.2%) was the leading cause following 
by direct workers contact with an energized power 
line (47 cases, 18.4%), direct workers contact with 
an energized equipment (42 cases, 16.5%), boomed 
vehicle contact with an energized power line (36 
cases, 14.1%) and conductive equipment contact 
with an energized power line (18 cases, 7.1%). 
Source of contact were coded and analyzed 
according to the U.S. Department of Labor (2003) as 
showed in Table 3. The result indicated that 
machinery (87), power line (47), hand tools (33), 
energized objects (30), electrical equipment (21), 
lighting equipment (17), and electrical wiring (15) 
were the common source of contact. Mobile cranes 
(29) and welding apparatus (26) accounted for 
majority of the 87 cases involving machinery. For 
electrical equipment, most cases were related to 
electrical control panels (9), switch boxes (7), and 
transformers (4) while for hand tools most cases 
involving the use of electric drills (11), sanders (5), 
and saws (4). 
Performing task was dividing into performing 
electrical work and not performing electrical work as 
in Table 4. The cases for not performing electrical 
work (60.4%) were approximately twice as many as 
those performing electrical work similar to several 
other studies, e.g., 60% in Harvey-Sutton, et al (1992) 
and 55% in Pineaut, Rossignal, and Barr (1994). It 
revealed many workers are exposed to electrical 
energy daily during the performance of their tasks. 
For performing electrical work, majority of the cases 
involving installing, moving, or repairing powerlines 
or poles (47), working on hot light fixtures (16), 
installing cable TV wire or telecommunication lines 
(9), stripping hot wire (9), working on electrical 
equipment (8), hot machinery or equipment (6) were 
the main performing tasks. While on the other hand, 
for not performing electrical work, majority of the 
cases involving operating vehicles (35), operating 
hand tools (36), routine machine operation (24), 
material handling (18), cleaning (17), welding (11), 
servicing/ repairing (10), and were the main 
performing tasks. Additionally, the workers might 
get electrocuted during resting.  
 
3.2. Association between factors and between levels 
of factors 
Associations among all contributing factors 
were revealed by the Cramer's V analysis. Company 
size was associated with all factors, and cause of 
electrocution was associated with all factors except 
for age. Task, source of injury and accident pattern 
were interrelated. These significant associations 
between factors were subjected to more analysis
