Microstrucutral Evolution and Microwave Dielectric Properties of 
Multi-phase Ba(Ti1-xMx)O3 Ceramics 
 
 
 
Abstract. In this study, the feasibility for use of multiphase BaTiO3 ceramics as microwave 
dielectric resonators was evaluated through the substitution of metal ions in B sites, such as ions of 
Mn, Co, Mg, In, Fe, Zn, and Ni.  The effects of metal ions substitution and sintering conditions on 
the densification, microstructural evolution and microwave properties of the BaTiO3 ceramics 
containing cubic and hexagonal phase were examined.  Based on the overall performance, the best 
results were acquired for the Ba(Ti0.65Mn0.35)O3 (εr : 41.2, Q·ƒr : 14,300, and τf :18.6 ppm/°C) and 
Ba(Ti0.50Mn0.50)O3 ceramics (εr : 32.8, Q·ƒr : 6,450, and τf : 3.6 ppm/°C).  These results suggest 
the Ba(Ti1-xMnx)O3 ceramics are suitable for the dielectric resonator applications.

1. Introduction 
Barium titanate, BaTiO3, based ceramics, 
which are commonly recognized as cornerstone 
of electroceramics, find applications in 
capacitors, positive temperature coefficient of 
resistance (PTCR) thermistors, chemical 
sensors, and piezoelectric devices.  Most 
research to date has focused on the 
low-temperature tetragonal polymorph 
(t-BaTiO3), due to the fact that it possesses the 
ferroelectric properties and the high dielectric 
constant at room temperature (εr ≈ 1000-2000). 
6h-hexagonal BaTiO3 polymorph (h-BaTiO3) is 
reported to be thermodynamically stable above 
1460°C according to the BaO-TiO2 phase 
diagram [1]. Yet, it is kinetically stabilized at 
room temperature by many routes such as rapid 
quenching to room temperature after sintering 
at >1460°C in air [1], or sintering at above 
1300°C in reducing atmosphere [2,3], and also 
by sintering of acceptor-doped BaTiO3 in air 
[4-6].  For the latter two routes, the formation 
temperature of the h-BaTiO3 is well below the 
h→c phase transformation temperature, 1460°C 
[5]. 
Recently, doped h-BaTiO3 ceramics were 
reported as potential candidates for use in 
dielectric resonators [6-9]. Wang et al. [8,9] 
investigated the microwave properties of doped 
h-BaTiO3 ceramics and found that the best 
results were obtained for the composition of 
h-Ba(Ti0.65Mn0.35)O3 (εr : 41.2, Q·ƒr : 14,300, 
and τf :18.6 ppm/°C). However, similar to 
common microwave ceramics, doped h-BaTiO3 
ceramics require a high sintering temperature of 
greater than 1300°C, which restricts the 
possibility of cofiring with other components. 
Up to now, no report has been found in the 
literature regarding the low sintering 
temperature of hexagonal BaTiO3 ceramics. It is 
thus our motivation to reduce the sintering 
temperature of Mn-doped h-BaTiO3 below 
1000°C while retaining the hexagonal structure 
and microwave dielectric properties.  
In the present study, Ba(Ti1-xMnx)O3 
with x = 0.15 [Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3] was used 
as host material since the pure form of 
hexagonal phase can be obtained at a 
calcination temperature of 1100°C. The host 
material was then mixed with small 
amounts of common sintering aids, 
including Bi2O3, B2O3, BaSiO3, Li2CO3, 
CuO, V2O5, 5ZnO‧2B2O3, and 5ZnO‧2SiO2 
[10-16], and followed by sintering at 
different temperatures. The effects of 
sintering aids on the densification, 
microstructural evolution and microwave 
properties of the h-Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 
ceramics were examined and discussed 
 
2. Experimental Procedure 
Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 powders were prepared 
by a solid-state reaction technique.  
High-purity (>99.9% purity) TiO2, BaCO3, and 
disappearance of the 12R-BaFeO3 polytype 
structure, as shown in Figure 2(a). Density of 
5.83 g/cm3 (99.5% theoretical) can be achieved 
at sintering temperature of 1100°C. It appears 
that the grain growth was inhibited by the 
addition of Bi2O3 during sintering. An average 
grain size of ≈ 0.8 µm was observed at the 
sintering temperature of 900°C for host material 
with 5wt% Bi2O3. Carefully examining the 
SEM micrograph, a second phase was observed 
at the grain boundaries. The effect of Bi2O3 
addition on the microstructural evolution of 
hexagonal BaTiO3 is similar to that observed in 
the tetragonal BaTiO3, reported by Kumar et al. 
[14]. 
 Figure 4(a) shows the microwave 
dielectric properties of the 
6h-Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 ceramics with additions 
of 3 and 5wt% Bi2O3. Both the dielectric 
constant and the quality factor are diluted by the 
addition of Bi2O3, but change in the temperature 
coefficient of the resonance frequency is trivial. 
Dielectric constant increases with the sintering 
temperature and the amount of Bi2O3, and is in 
turn strongly correlated to the trends of 
sintering densities. Generally the Q⋅f value 
decreases with the sintering temperature, which 
is due to the interaction of Bi2O3 and host 
material at high temperatures that poisons the 
quality factor. The best results obtained in this 
study were εr of 54.7, Q⋅f of 1,323 and τf of 
183.4 ppm/°C.  
(b) Hexagonal Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 with 
addition of B2O3 
Figure 1(a) shows the sintered density vs. 
sintering temperature for the host material with 
various amounts of B2O3. Addition of B2O3 
significantly reduces the densification 
temperature of the host material. The sintered 
densities of the samples increase with the extent 
of B2O3. In order to reduce the sintering 
temperature to below 1000°C, 10 wt% of B2O3 
was added into the post-calcined 
Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 powders. Density of 5.4 
g/cm3 for the ceramic was obtained. Increasing 
the soaking time from 2 to 6 h has an obvious 
change in the density (5.58 g/cm3). However, 
further increase in the soaking time results in 
reduction of sintered density, due to the 
evaporation of B2O3 and the trapped porosity 
[15]. For the sintering temperatures below 
1100°C, a minor phase of 12R polytype 
structure and a second phase of B2O3 were 
present in the ceramics [Figure 2(a)]. Very 
dense microstructure with an average grain size 
of 1.9 µm for host material with 10 wt% B2O3 
sintered at 1000°C for 6 h was seen, as shown 
in Figure 3 (c). 
The microwave dielectric properties of the 
host materials with 10 wt% B2O3 addition and 
sintered at various temperatures were shown in 
Figure 4 (c). The εr, Q⋅f and τf values for the 
ceramics sintered at 1000 and 1100°C are 52.1, 
1,770, and 271.7 ppm/°C, and 54.4, 3,448, and 
254.5 ppm/°C, respectively. Increasing the 
soaking time at 1000°C does not further 
improve the microwave dielectric properties of 
the ceramics. 
(c) Hexagonal Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 with 
addition of Li2CO3 
Among the fluxes studied, Li2CO3 is the 
most effective sintering aid for the hexagonal 
Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 ceramic, similar to that 
observed in tetragonal BaTiO3 [20-22]. 
Maximum sintered densities were achieved at 
the sintering temperatures of 900°C and 850°C 
for the addition of 3 and 5wt% Li2CO3, 
respectively. Above the temperature at which 
maximum density was achieved, the sintered 
density levels off. The sintered density 
decreases with increasing the Li2CO3 content 
due to the light weight nature of Li compounds. 
Only h- and 12R-Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 phases are 
present in the XRD patterns and no detectable 
second phase was observed, as shown in Figure 
2(b). Grain size of the Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 
ceramics sintered with Li2CO3 increases 
significantly with sintering temperature and the 
content of the Li2CO3, which is commonly 
reported in the liquid phase sintering of 
ceramics. Figure 3 (c) shows the dense 
microstructure of the Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 
ceramic with 3wt% of Li2CO3 sintered at 900°C, 
in which the average grain size is 1.6 µm.  
As shown in Figure 4(c), the change in 
dielectric constant of the Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 
ceramics with Li2CO3 additions is insignificant, 
while it follows the path of sintered density 
versus temperature profile very well. The 
dielectric constants of ceramics with 3 and 
5wt% of Li2CO3 and sintered at 850°C are 51.4 
and 43, respectively. Clearly, dielectric 
constants of the ceramics were diluted by the 
presence of the second phase. It may be 
εr values are diluted by the presence of the 
second phase at the grain boundaries, and the 
Q⋅f values are degraded by the chemical 
interaction of the host materials and the fluxes, 
which reduces the ordering of the structure or 
decreases the chemical purity. The τf values of 
the fluxed and sintered ceramics are dependent 
on the substitutions of the foreign ions which 
alters the tilt angle of the TiO6-octahedron. 
 
4. Summary 
In this study, 6-Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 with 
additions of various sintering aids, including 
Bi2O3, B2O3, BaSiO3, Li2CO3, CuO, V2O5, 
5ZnO‧2B2O3, and 5ZnO‧2SiO2, were sintered 
at different temperatures. The effects of 
sintering aids on the densification, 
microstructural evolution and microwave 
properties of the h-Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 ceramics 
were examined. Among the fluxes studied, 
Bi2O3, B2O3, and Li2CO3 were found to be 
effective sintering aids for the 
h-Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 ceramics. Results indicate 
that the best results were obtained for the 
compositions of h-Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 with the 
additions of 5wt% Bi2O3 sintered at 900°C (εr : 
54.7, Q·ƒr : 1,323, and τf :183.3 ppm/°C), 
10wt% B2O3 sintered at 1100°C (εr : 54.4, Q·ƒr : 
3,448, and τf : 254.5 ppm/°C), and 5wt% 
Li2CO3 sintered at 950°C (εr : 43.7, Q·ƒr : 2,501, 
and τf : -29.8 ppm/°C). These results suggest 
that h-Ba(Ti0.85Mn0.15)O3 ceramics can be 
sintered with fluxes at temperatures lower than 
1100°C through liquid phase sintering, while 
retaining its hexagonal structure and microwave 
dielectric properties.
