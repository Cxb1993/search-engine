Figure 1: The spectra of (a) the input and (b) the output
signals of a quadratically nonlinear system.
although the ranges of valid bandpass sampling frequency
for the input signal can be obtained by using the well
known bandpass sampling theory [4], these ranges of valid
bandpass sampling frequency can not be applied to sample
the output signal without causing aliasing.
For identifying the Volterra kernels [5] of nonlinear sys-
tems, it has been shown that sampling the input and out-
put signals at the minimum sampling rate of the input
signal is sufficient, even though the resulting output data
samples are aliased in the circumstances [6, 7, 8, 9]. How-
ever, when system identification is not the main concern,
avoiding aliasing in the output data samples to preserve
all important information from the original output signal
is often desired.
Note that methods for finding the valid bandpass sam-
pling frequencies for multiple RF signals have recently
been developed [10, 11, 12]. Although it is theoretically
possible to apply these methods to the output signals of
nonlinear systems, it would be quite inefficient to do so.
This is because that these methods were not meant for
the sampling problems of nonlinear systems. Hence, they
did not explore the characteristics of nonlinear systems to
obtain simple and dedicated bandpass sampling require-
ments for nonlinear systems.
Recently, dedicated bandpass sampling requirements for
nonlinear systems up to the third order were derived by
studying the feasible permutations of the spectral replicas
in the spectrum of the sampled output signal[13]. Using
the output signal of the quadratically nonlinear system
shown in Fig. 1(b) as an example, the spectrum of the
sampled output signal can be obtained by replicating the
spectrum of the original output signal at integer multiples
of the sampling frequency. To be immune to aliasing, the
replicas from various spectra (i.e., the spectra labeled ‘-2’,
‘-1’, ‘0’, ‘1’, and ‘2’) in Fig. 1(b) must be arranged in cer-
tain permutations without overlapping in the spectrum of
the sampled output signal. In [13], the constraints on the
bandpass sampling frequency were determined for each
feasible permutation of the spectral replicas, and then the
corresponding range of valid bandpass sampling frequency
was derived. This approach, however, is not easily extend-
able to higher-order nonlinear systems, because there is
a lack of straightforward way to find the complete feasi-
ble permutations of the spectral replicas for higher-order
nonlinear systems. For this reason, the derivation of the
complete bandpass sampling requirements was only con-
ducted for nonlinear systems up to the third order. For
nonlinear systems higher than the third order, the band-
pass sampling requirements given in [13] were incomplete
because only the ranges of bandpass sampling frequency
for two special permutations of the spectral replicas were
derived.
The goal of this project is to develop an efficient method
for deriving the complete bandpass sampling requirements
for nonlinear systems of an arbitrary order. The method
we adopt is to explore the nonoverlapping conditions for
the spectral replicas of the sampled output signal with-
out resorting to the permutations of the spectral replicas.
The idea behind the method is that, for any two spectra
in the original output signal, their replicas in the sampled
output signal should be nonoverlapping to avoid aliasing.
By exploring the nonoverlapping conditions from two con-
secutive spectra to the two spectra farthest apart, we can
derive the corresponding constraints on the bandpass sam-
pling frequency. These constraints should yield the valid
bandpass sampling frequency ranges for the output sig-
nal of the nonlinear system. In addition, the derivation
process provides an insight into the way the constraints
on the bandpass sampling frequency can be determined.
Based on this insight, one should be able to generalize
the derivation of the valid bandpass sampling frequency
ranges to nonlinear systems of any order with ease. Hence,
a universal formula for the complete bandpass sampling
requirements for nonlinear systems of any order can be
obtained.
2 Nonoverlapping Conditions for
the Replicas of Any Two Spec-
tra
In this section,we will study the nonoverlapping conditions
for the replicas of any two spectra in the output signal of
a nonlinear system.
As shown in Fig. 1, a nonlinear system driven by a band-
pass input signal with a spectrum centering at frequency
f1 may produce an output signal containing multiple spec-
tra centering at integer multiples of f1. Let’s refer to the
spectrum centering at if1 as spectrum ‘i’ for convenience.
Note that the various spectra may have different band-
widths. Consider the two spectra ‘i’ and ‘j’ (with band-

then fLs = Lkm.

then fUs = Ukm.

among which Skm is at the lowest stage, then f

Rule 4 If the ²U of a partition is set by multiple stage constraints,
among which Skm is at the lowest stage, then f

s = Lkm.
S11 are shown in the row labeled S11 in Table 1, where the
range of ² is expressed in the form of [²L, ²U ) with ²L and
²U denoting the lower and upper bounds of ², respectively.
In addition, the fLs and f
U
s for the stage constraint S11 are
denoted as L11 and U11, respectively, for easy reference.
Similarly, for the case of two spectra separated by 2f1
in Fig. 1(b), we have k = 2 and W2 = 2B + 2B = 4B.
Using (8), (2), and (11), we obtain the stage 2 constraints
(labeled S21 and S22) shown in Table 1. For the case of
any two spectra separated by 3f1 in Fig. 1(b), we have
k = 3 and W3 = B + 2B = 3B. For the case of any two
spectra separated by 4f1 in Fig. 1(b), we have k = 4 and
W4 = 2B + 2B = 4B. Again, by using (8), (2), and (11),
we obtain the stage 3 constraints (labeled S31, S32, and
S33) and stage 4 constraints (labeled S41, S42, S43, and
S44) shown in Table 1.
A valid bandpass sampling frequency for the output sig-
nal of a quadratically nonlinear system must satisfy the
stage 1 to 4 constraints simultaneously. The constraints
on fs need to be satisfied in various stages for different
ranges of ² are shown by the partition chart in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3, each stage constraint is labeled, plotted as a
rectangular bar, and positioned according to its stage and
range of ². The endpoints of the range of ² for each stage
constraint are projected onto the number line for ² at the
bottom of Fig. 3. The collection of all the endpoints di-
vides the range 0 ≤ ² < 1 into 6 partitions, which are

denoted as P1 to P6 in Fig. 3.
As suggested by (11), given f1 and n, the sampling fre-
quency fs increases with decreasing ². Therefore, the up-
per bound of fs (i.e., fUs ) for a stage constraint is reached
when ² approaches its lower bound ²L. This implies that,
the larger the ²L, the smaller the fUs . Therefore, the stage
constraint with the largest ²L has the smallest fUs . Using
this idea, one can show that, the valid bandpass sampling
frequency range for a partition can be simply determined
by the rules shown in Table 2. Based on Tables 1 and 2 and
Fig. 3, one can obtain the valid sampling frequency ranges
for partitions P1 to P6 shown in Table 3. For example, the
range of ² for partition P4 in Fig. 3 is 1/2 ≤ ² < 2/3. In
addition, the ²L = 1/2 is set by S22 and S43, and the
²U = 2/3 is set by S32. Using rules 3 and 1 in Table 2,
one obtains L32 < fs < U22. By replacing L32 and U22
with their formulas in Table 1, one obtains the range of
fs for partition P4 in Table 3. The results for the rest of
the partitions in Table 3 are obtained similarly.

where x(t), y(t), and e(t) are the input, output, and ad-
ditive white Gaussian noise of the system. The noise
power was set such that the signal to noise ratio (SNR)
was 40 dB. The input signal to the 4-th order nonlinear
system was an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(OFDM) signal [15] centering at f1 = 1500 Hz with 10
subchannels. The modulation scheme used for the 10 sub-
channels was 16 QAM. The proposed universal formula
was used to find the valid sampling frequencies. The re-
sult justifies the goodness of the universal formula. Fur-
ther detail of this simulation can be found in [16].
6 Conclusion
In this project, complete bandpass sampling requirements
for nonlinear systems of an arbitrary order have been de-
rived. The bandpass sampling requirements were derived
by exploring multiple stages of nonoverlapping conditions
for the spectral replicas of the sampled output signal. A
universal formula for the complete ranges of bandpass
sampling frequency for nonlinear systems of any order
was obtained. A computer simulation was conducted to
demonstrate the usage and the correctness of the derived
formula. The derivation result has consolidated the theory
of bandpass sampling for nonlinear systems.

multitone power ratio (MTPR) tests for determining the signal-
to-distortion ratio of a discrete multitone system [3]. By
using the difference signal yielded from the channel outputs
of two OFDM signals, one with a spectral notch and the
other without, we show that a frequency-domain Volterra
kernel estimation task involving a large number of kernel
coefficients can be decomposed into independent kernel esti-
mation subtasks, each involving a significantly smaller number
of kernel coefficients. Due to the small number of kernel
coefficients, each individual kernel estimation subtask can be
solved with more accuracy and less computation. For a real
baseband OFDM system with N = 2M (M a positive integer)
subcarriers and a cubically nonlinear channel, the overall
computational complexity required by the proposed method
is O(M4), which is significantly less than the O(M6) for the
conventional method described in [13], [14]. The goodness of
the proposed method is also justified by computer simulations.
II. REAL BASEBAND OFDM SYSTEMS
A baseband OFDM signal is defined as:
x(n) =
1
N
N−1∑
m=0
X(m)ej2πnm/N , n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1 (1)
where {X(m)} are the complex data symbols and N is the
number of subcarriers. For a sampling period of Ts, the above
OFDM signal has a waveform duration of T = NTs. The
subcarriers are equally spaced and separated by Δf = 1/T .
For wireline communications such as PLC and ADSL, the
baseband OFDM signal is transmitted without further fre-
quency upconversion. Therefore, the OFDM signal x(n) has to
be real. To comply with this constraint, the symbols {X(m)}
need to be conjugate symmetric with respect to the discrete
frequency N/2 [1]. In addition, X(0) and X(N/2) need to
be real. This implies that only N/2− 1 independent complex
data symbols can be transmitted in each frame of real OFDM
signal with N subcarriers.
The block diagram of a real OFDM system is shown in
Fig. 1. In the transmitting end, the bit stream b[n] is first
converted to parallel bit streams (via the serial-to-parallel
(S/P) converter) according to the available subcarriers in the
OFDM system. Each bit stream is further mapped to the
symbol stream according to the chosen modulation scheme
(eg., PSK or QAM). Here the m-th symbol stream is denoted
by X(m). The N parallel symbols for the N subcarriers are
then processed by an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT)
to obtain the time-domain baseband OFDM signal x(n). The
baseband signal is filtered, converted to an analog signal (via
the D/A), boosted by the power amplifier (PA), and then
sent via the wireline channel. The OFDM receiver performs
analog-to-digital conversion (A/D), filtering, and fast Fourier
transform (FFT) to obtain the output symbols {Y (m)} for
the N subchannels. The output symbols {Y (m)} are further
detected to obtain the optimum estimates of {X(m)}, say,
{Xˆ(m)}. Finally, the detected bit stream bˆ[n] can be obtained
from {Xˆ(m)} through bit mapping and parallel-to-serial (P/S)
conversion.

III. MMSE ESTIMATE OF THE FREQUENCY-DOMAIN
VOLTERRA KERNELS
Due to the existence of the PA in Fig. 1, the baseband
OFDM communication channel may become nonlinear. Sup-
pose that the subcarriers span a bandwidth of W . Due to the
possible bandwidth broadening characteristics of the nonlinear
channel, the channel output may have a bandwidth as wide
as 3W [13]. If the input and output signals were sampled
at fs ≥ 6W to prevent output data samples from aliasing,
then the discrete frequency-domain third-order Volterra series
representation of the OFDM system can be written as follows
[13]:
Y (m) = Y1(m) + Y2(m) + Y3(m) + ε(m),
−3M ≤ m ≤ 3M (2)
Y1(m) =
{
H1(m)X(m), |m| ≤ M

∑
−M≤i,j,k≤M
(i+j+k=m)
H3(i, j, k)X(i)X(j)X(k),
|m| ≤ 3M (5)
where X(m) and Y (m) are the discrete Fourier transforms
(DFTs) of the input and output, and Y1(m), Y2(m), and Y3(m)
are the linear, quadratic, and cubic responses of the system.
The linear, quadratic, and cubic Volterra kernels of the system
are denoted by H1(m), H2(i, j), and H3(i, j, k), respectively,
in (3)-(5). The modeling error is denoted by ε(m), and the
maximum discrete frequency of X(m) with a non-zero value
is denoted by M .
However, in an OFDM system like that shown in Fig. 1,
the sampling frequency fs is often set to 2W instead of 6W .
Under the circumstances, the resulting output data samples are

Basically, Y (p)1 (m), Y

(p)
3 (m) are obtained from
Y1(m), Y2(m), and Y3(m), respectively, by eliminating those
terms involving X(p) and X(−p) in (3)-(5). One can compare
(12)-(14) to (3)-(5) to see the differences.
Next we subtract Y (p)(m) from Y (m) to obtain their
difference spectrum Z(p)(m). The result would be like that
shown in Fig. 3(c). Note that all the spectral lines in Fig. 3(c)
are completely owing to nonlinear distortions related to the
spectral lines X(p) and X(−p) in Fig. 2(a). The difference
spectrum Z(p)(m) can be mathematically expressed as:
Z(p)(m) = Z(p)1 (m) + Z

2 (m) + Z

2 (−N + m)
+Z(p)3 (m) + Z

|m| ≤ 3M (18)
Note that the right-hand sides of (16)-(18) in fact contain only
those terms involving X(p) or X(−p) in (3)-(5), respectively.
The error term ψ(p)(m) in (15) is defined as ψ(p)(m) =
ε(m)− ε(p)(m).
By arranging all the Volterra kernel coefficients in (15) into
a vector H(p)(m), and all their corresponding input terms into
a vector X(p)(m), we can rewrite (15) as
Z(p)(m) = X(p)T (m)H(p)(m) + ψ(p)(m) (19)
By minimizing the mean square error E[|ψ(p)(m)|2], one can
obtain the optimum MMSE estimate of H(p)(m) as follows:
Hˆ(p)(m) = E[X(p)∗(m)X(p)T (m)]−1E[X(p)∗(m)Z(p)(m)],
0 ≤ m ≤ M, 0 ≤ p ≤ M (20)
After taking into account the symmetry properties of the
Volterra kernels, we see that there are at most 2 distinct
quadratic kernel coefficients and M distinct cubic kernel
coefficients involved in (17) and (18), respectively. Since the
cubic kernel coefficients dominate the vector H(p)(m), the size
of the vector H(p)(m) (and hence X(p)(m)) is approximately
M . This suggests that the complexity of inverting the matrix in
(20) is O(M3). Note that H(p)(m) only includes those kernel
coefficients contributing to Y (m) and excited by X(p) or
X(−p). By varying p from 0 to M , we can cover all the kernel
coefficients contributing to Y (m). This implies that, to get
estimates for all the kernel coefficients contributing to Y (m),
the computational complexity required by the spectral notch
method is M×O(M3) = O(M4). This is a significant saving
compared to the O(M6) required by the general input method.
Furthermore, as we vary p from 0 to M , some of the kernel
coefficients included in H(p)(m) may have already appeared in
H(r)(m) (r ∈ [0, p)) and been estimated earlier. These kernel
coefficients don’t need to be estimated again in H(p)(m).
For example, the cubic kernel coefficient H(0, 1, 2) is excited
by X(0), X(1), and X(2), therefore, it would show up in
H(0)(3), H(1)(3), and H(2)(3). Since this coefficient would
have been estimated in H(0)(3), it doesn’t need to be estimated
again when estimating H(1)(3) and H(2)(3). Therefore, for
those kernel coefficients in H(p)(m) that have already been
estimated earlier, we can substitute their estimated values into
(19) and eliminate them from H(p)(m). As a result, the size
of the vector H(p)(m) is reduced. That is, the size of H(p)(m)
will keep decreasing as we vary p from 0 to M . This further
reduces the computational complexity of the spectral notch
method.
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
To demonstrate the goodness of the spectral notch method,
we conducted simulations using the following cubically non-
linear system [14]:
y(n) = −0.64x(n) + x(n− 2) + 0.9x2(n) + x2(n− 1)
+0.6x3(n)− 0.3x3(n− 1) + e(n) (21)

be estimated independently. Since each group involves only
a relatively small number of Volterra kernel coefficients, the
Volterra kernels can be estimated more accurately by the
proposed method using the same amount of available input
and output data. Furthermore, due to the smaller number
of Volterra kernel coefficients involved in each group, the
proposed spectral notch method requires significantly less
computation than the conventional general input method.
Specifically, we have shown that, the conventional general
input method has a computational complexity of O(M6),
while the proposed spectral notch method only requires a
computational complexity of O(M4). The advantage of the
proposed spectral notch method over the conventional general
input method has been justified by the computer simulations.
