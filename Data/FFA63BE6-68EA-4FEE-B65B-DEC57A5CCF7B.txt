However, consider the combination of the fuzzy 
inference rules in FMF, each membership function is 
proposed by approximating the function with a step-like 
function, and setting the height of each step so that the 
mean square error of the filter output can be the 
minimum for training signal data [3]. However, the width 
of the steps in approximating the membership function as 
a step-like function is hard to design, since each axis is 
equally divided into piecewise regions with this width, 
then the size of divided area will influence the filter 
performance with the associated contains in different 
piecewise regions. 
Besides, if the membership function in FMF is applied 
by a smooth nonlinear function, such as a Gaussian type, 
in approximating the membership function. However, 
such nonlinear Gaussian function is used, the form of the 
membership function is constrained to be close to these 
functions, and the filter will be expressed as a nonlinear 
form of the parameters to be controlled, the performance 
of their training will be worse. 
In this study, an adaptive filter is proposed based on 
the type-2 fuzzy sets to overcome the deficiencies of the 
FMF. The concept of type-2 fuzzy sets is initially 
proposed as an extension of type-1 fuzzy sets proposed 
by L. A. Zadeh [5]. Type-2 fuzzy sets, which are 
developed by Mendel and Karnik, have grades of 
membership that are themselves fuzzy [6]-[9]. That is, 
the membership function of a type-2 fuzzy set is 
three-dimensional that provides new design degrees of 
freedom for handling uncertainties. Hence, in type-2 FLS, 
antecedent or consequent uncertainties can be translated 
into uncertain antecedent or consequent membership 
function. When applying the type-2 FLS to fuzzy median 
filter, nonlinear type-2 Gaussian membership function 
can extend the restriction stated above and obtain more 
flexibility.

2.1 The Fuzzy Median Filter 
One of the most famous nonlinear filters is the median 
filter, which has been widely used to remove impulsive 
noises. However, the FMF is designed to preserve the 
advantage of median filter and to prevent the drawbacks 
[10].  
The fuzzy system is the major part of the FMF. The 
size of the sliding window is 3×3, and this window is 
read from a noisy image pixel each time during the 
process. The noisy image signal at the pixel (i,j) are 
considered to be located at xij. There are two parameters 
uij and vij defined form the sliding window as the fuzzy 
system inputs. uij is defined as uij = |xij - mij|, which is 
used to indicate the impulsive noises existed or not. vij is 
indicated as the line components existed or not, which is 
defined as vij = (a + b)/ 2, where a = | xij- |, b = | x1ijs ij- |, 
 and  are the pixel values that are closest to the 
current pixel x

ij. The output of the fuzzy system is 
denoted by ijμ . ijμ  is expressed as the function about 
the degree of impulsive noises inexistence. The function 
of the modified median filter is: 
yij = mij + )( ijijij mx −μ , 
where yij is the output of the FMF and ∈ijμ  [0, 1]. 
When ijμ = 0, impulsive noises are considered to be 
located at xij, and the output of FMF is the median value 
of the sliding window. When ijμ = 1, impulsive noises 
are considered not to be existed, and the output is equal 
to the original pixel xij.   
According to the definition of uij, vij and ijμ ,  the 
following fuzzy rules are used to represent the relation 
among these parameters, 
Rule 1: IF uij is small and vij is small, THEN ijμ  is 
large, 
Rule 2: IF uij is small and vij is large, THEN ijμ  is 
small,

 Herein, a type-2 FLS has four rule-based in our system 
and two inputs , 11 Xx ∈ 22 Xx ∈ . The l’th rule has the 
form 
:lR  IF  and , THEN y is lFx 11  is 
lFx 22  is lG

where l = 1, …, 4.  and  are type-1 fuzzy sets. 
Suppose 
lF1
lF2
lG~  is type-2 fuzzy sets. This rule represents a 
type-2 fuzzy relation that maps the input space, 21X×to the 
output space, Y. Suppose the Cartesian product of two 
fuzzy sets, . denotes the so-called 
join operation and denotes the meet operation[6]-[9]. 
Herein, the antecedent operation is product t-norm. 
Therefore, the structure of the l’th type-2 rule is 
re-expressed by Eq. (2)

The output of the inference engine in our system must 
be processed next by the output processor and the first 
operation is type-reduction. The method is adopted by 
center-of-sets type-reduction [11]. In order to convenient

adopted in this thesis. Therefore, the center-of-set 
defuzzification for the output is expressed by

The impulsive noises affect the images with distinct 
probabilities 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Two indexes, 
mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error 
(MAE) are considered to measure the performance of the 
restored images. 
Table 1 till 3 show the comparisons with the MSE and 
of type-1 FMF, type-2 FMF, Arakawa (5×5 regions), and 
Arakawa (6×6 regions), respectively. It is obviously that 
our proposed system with type-2 FLS is outperforming 
other systems. Table 1 shows the type-2 FMF better 
performance than the type-1 FMF, Arakawa (5×5 regions 
divided), and Arakawa (6×6 regions divided). Table 2 
and table 3 are the conditions for the Family and Peppers 
images. 
In the above experiment, the training image and testing 
image remains the same, so far. That capability is called 
memorized capability of filters. In other words, a filter is 
trained using a pair of training images in advance to 
memorize prior knowledge in terms of weights. Due to 
the memorization of prior knowledge, we know that a 
basketball player refereeing in the basketball match is 
unfair. Therefore, another important robust capability is 
also considered in this experiment. In order to asses the 
robust performance, the training and testing image should 
be different filters. The robust capability must be taken 
into account on the design of fuzzy median filters. Let a 
noisy image be represented by iϕ  divided into two 
separated subimages  and  such that 
. The training image  is a half portion 
of

255) to pixel (255, 255).

The  is trained an type-2 FMF in advance and 
type-2 FMF is applied to filter the testing image . 
Table 4 till 6 show the performance of MAE and MSE, 
and compares the difference of the performance of the 
robust capability with type-2 FMF, type-1 FMF and 
Arakawa (6×6 regions divided), respectively. From those 
experimental results, the type-2 fuzzy median filter 
possesses highly robust capability. That is, the type-2 
fuzzy median filter is still able to obtain a better filtering 
performance than other filters.

三、討論與結論： 
In this study, most of the conventionally fuzzy-based 
image restoration systems are implemented with type-1 
FLSs. The type-2 FLSs can cope with the uncertain 
operation beyond the type-1 FLSs. However, a general 
type-2 FLS is too complicated due to calculate the meet 
operation for the each fired rule, especially when product 
t-norm in our system. We have no rational basis for 
choosing secondary membership functions [9]. Since the 
values of all possibility embedded type-2 fuzzy sets are 
computed in the defuzzify process, the performance of 
the type-2 FLS is very complex. To improve performance 
of the type-2 FLS, the type-reduction methods can be 
chosen in the type-2 FLSs. In this thesis, we implement a 
modified center-of-sets type-reduction method in our 
system. 
From the observation of these experimental results, the 
MSE and MAE of the type-2 fuzzy median filter indicate 
that outperforms than other filters. From the results of the 
robust experiment in this study, the robust capability is 
also possessed by the type-2 fuzzy median filter. Because 
impulsive noises can cause the pixel’s value that has 
great variation, there are more flat or smooth areas in an 
image that can be better experiment result than 
Arakawa’s method. On the other hand, the performance 
of the type-2 median filter still needs to be improved in 
future word.
