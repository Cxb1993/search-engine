a menstruum of sulfonamides was used as received.  
 
Preparation of Sol-Gel Molecularly Imprinted Polymer (MIP) 
Sulfamethazine was dissolved in deionized water, and then tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and 
methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) were added. 0.002 mol of sulfamethazine and 750 μl of hydrochloric acid 
were dissolved completely in various quantity of deionized water by stirring the solution at room temperature 
for 30 minutes, and then various ratios of tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) 
were added to above solution. The sol-gel solution was reacted at 60°C in the following 2 days. After the 
reaction was completed, the monoliths were grounded and sieved to obtain particle sizes between 53 and 88 
μm. Next, the template molecule was removed by calcination, and then the MIP was purged with deionized 
water. A non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was prepared in parallel and under identical conditions but in the 
absence of the template. 
 
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis of MIP 
Both the sulfamethazine and the structurally analogous molecule (sulfamethoxazole) were dissolved in 
water to produce a standard solution which contained 100 ppm of sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole 
respectively. The 200 mg MIP was added in 10 ml standard solution and adsorbed at room temperature for 30 
min to complete the adsorption. Then, the MIP solution mixtures were centrifuged to obtain the residual 
solution. The above solution was injected into HPLC to investigate the residual concentration of 
sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole. The adsorption and selectivity (α) of MIP were determined by 
competition adsorption experiment; the quantity of absorption (AdSMZ and AdSMO) of MIP was obtained by the 
difference between the original concentration (100 ppm) and the residual concentration. The selectivity (α) 
was obtained by comparison the adsorption of the template (AdSMZ) and analogue (AdSMO) on MIP. The 
HPLC analysis was performed by Waters 510 HPLC pump equipped with a SFD UV/vis Detector S32109 
(285 nm). Samples were analyzed on a 150mm×4.6mm 5_ Hypersil HS C18 column at room temperature with 
a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (mobile phase, water : methanol : acetic acid = 69 : 28 : 3, v/v). 
 
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Analysis of the MIP 
The Fourier transformed infrared spectra from pressed KBr pellets containing about 1% MIP using a 
JASCO FT/IR-410 spectrophotomer.  
 
Accelerated surface area and porosimetry (ASAP)  
BET surface area and pore structure characteristics were determined by nitrogen adsorption - desorption 
isotherm used for analysis. Porosity measurements were performed with Micromeritics ASAP 2010 analyzer. 
All samples were degassed at 120°C for 24 hr before measurement. BET surface area and pore parameters 
were measured with 55-point full analysis at cryogenic temperature (77.35 K). The micropore surface area 
and micropore pore volume were obtained by t-plot analysis with the Harkins–Jura equation. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Mechanism of the sol-gel molecularly imprinted polymer 
The molecular imprint polymers were prepared by adding the sulfamethazine (SMZ) solution dispersed 
along with tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) within the sol-gel mixture. 
The sol–gel process resulted in numerous hydroxyl groups produced after the hydrolysis and condensation of 
the silicon alkoxides. These hydroxyl groups promoted the interaction (hydrogen-bond) between the imprinted 
molecule and inorganic polymer matrix. During the formation of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), the 
template (SMZ) was incorporated into the inorganic polymer matrix, and the imprinted cavities and specific 
recognition sites of the sol-gel molecularly imprinted polymer were then formed after removing the template, 
water, and methanol. At this time, the water and methanol were removed prior to the temple, and the hydroxyl 
groups of matrix interacted with the template by hydrogen bond to enhance the recognition ability. The 
schematic diagram of the molecularly imprinted polymer preparation is shown in Figure 1.

MIP with various second stage temperatures are shown in Table III. In this section, HPLC analysis was 
carried out on samples R10 (H2O/Si molar ratio equals 10), and the second stage temperatures were carried 
out on 300°C, 325°C, 350°C, 375°C, and 400°C to obtain the optimum adsorption and selectivity. The results 
exhibited that the α and f increased with the increase in the second stage temperature until 375°C, and then the 
α and f decreased gradually. In other words, the α and f were achieved under optimum second stage 
temperature, but the additional second stage temperature could have decreased the efficiency. Due to the 
condensation reaction carried on with the hydroxyl groups by calcination, the sol-gel processes reacted more 
completely about 200°C. In addition, the methyl groups of methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) carried on 
decomposition because they became hydroxyl groups, and the hydroxyl groups reacted to each other during 
the condensation reaction about 400°C 25. Furthermore, the more specific recognition sites were formed when 
the condensation reaction was allowed to continue close to completion, hence the α and f increased with the 
increase of the second stage temperature in these MIP. In order to investigate this hypothesis, the Fourier 
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the MIP obtained form before and after calcination are 
shown in Figure 3. FTIR spectra exhibited in the MIP before and after calcination were almost the same. For 
after calcination, characteristic absorption peaks of Si-CH3 at 1300 cm-1 disappeared. This result indicates that 
the methyl groups carried on decomposition because they became hydroxyl groups at 400°C. Hence, the 
contention has been proved significant by the above accounts. Moreover, the second stage temperature was 
carried out on 400°C to obtain the high adsorption, but the selectivity of SMZ was sacrificed. Therefore, the 
optimum second stage temperature was set at 375°C for the present MIP. 
 
Effect of the TMOS and MTMOS molar fractions on MIP 
In this section, the preparation condition of the MIP with various TMOS and MTMOS fractions were 
studied. The fundamental properties of the sol-gel molecularly imprinted polymer with various TMOS and 
MTMOS fractions are shown in Table IV. The results indicate that the AdSMZ decreased with decrease of the 
TMOS and MTMOS fractions. This was due to the less quantity of TMOS causes the smaller BET surface 
area; therefore, an obviously less surface area results in fewer recognition sites and lower adsorption. In 
addition, the less quantity of TMOS caused the bigger pores, but the SMZ entered the specific recognition 
sites when the average pore size approximated to 5 nm which caused the increase of the opportunity of 
recognition sites bound with the template. Based on the results of the above descriptions, the greater α and f 
were achieved under better optimum TMOS and MTMOS molar fractions, TMOS/(TMOS+MTMOS) = 0.5. 
 
Effect of imprint (MIP) and non-imprint (NIP) 
In this section, the optimum preparation conditions were carried out on R=10, TMOS/( TMOS +MTMOS ) 
= 0.5, and reacted at 60°C for 2 days, and the second stage temperature of calcination was 375°C. A 
non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was prepared in parallel and under identical conditions but in the absence of the 
template. The fundamental properties of the MIP and NIP are shown in Table V. Comparison of the MIP and 
NIP prepared under optimum conditions showed that the BET surface area of the NIP was greater than the 
MIP, but even then the AdSMZ of NIP was not greater than the MIP. In addition, a comparison of the MIP and 
NIP showed that the α of MIP (10.5) was greater than NIP (3.72), and that the f of MIP (14.2) was greater 
than NIP (3.46). The α and f of MIP was approximately 3.5 times greater than the NIP 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The experimental results show that sol-gel molecularly imprinted polymers were successfully prepared 
during our research. The results indicate that the addition of an opportune amount of water could effectively 
increase selectivity of the sol-gel molecularly imprinted polymer. Moreover, that controlling the pH of the 
competition experiment solution to match the pKa of the template increased the adsorption and selectivity of 
the sol-gel molecularly imprinted polymer. In addition, the second stage temperature of calcination, which 
was carried out at 375°C, the more efficiency and high selectivity of MIP was obtained. Consequently, the 
most significant results were that a comparison of the sulfamethazine imprinted MIP prepared under optimum 
conditions and the NIP showed that the selectivity of the molecular imprinted polymer was about 3.5 times 
greater than the selectivity of the non-imprinted polymer.
