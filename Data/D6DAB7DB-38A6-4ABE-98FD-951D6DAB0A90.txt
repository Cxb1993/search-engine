Abstract 
Innovation is not only an indispensible condition by which any industries attempt to maintain 
their competitive advantage and consolidate their competitiveness in a market, but also a strategic 
activity that may influence their prospects of management and administration. There is no doubt that 
the activity of innovation may bring uncertainty to the development of technique, the way of 
production, and the need of market. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs still bear the uncertainties in order to 
create future expected (economic) profits. If the innovation is successful, they can make excess profits 
brought by their competitive advantage.  
Creative industry has been considered to be highly irreversible, i.e., creative business runners 
must withstand great investment risk so as to have the possibility of earning splendid profits.  
Nonetheless, once they fail to do so, they will lose vast amounts of capital. In other words, investment 
projects in cultural and creative industries, due to innovation, are likely to confront the challenge of 
high uncertainty. Furthermore, fulfilling technology innovation and innovative theme in new 
investment projects is the imperative condition whereby creative business runners are able to stand out. 
Traditional capital budgeting evaluation model often fails to fully reveal the impacts brought by the 
uncertainties. Therefore, this study, based on the theory of economic rent, discussed the economic 
value of some investment projects in creative industries, and further evaluated and analyzed the 
box-office cash flow pattern of previous cases. According to this, the researcher constructed an 
expected cash flow model under the concepts of economic rent and relative opportunity cost of capital 
and proposed implementing investment pricing model in creative industry’s box-office revenue 
through binomial option pricing technique.  There is an additional research result in this study. 
Because the progressing rapidly with amazing memory expansion space and the efficiency of the CPU 
of the computer hardware, let the binomial option pricing approach has not been limited to the size of 
the memory space of the computer to downgrade the computing efficiency.  In today's 64-bit 
computer hardware conditions, this study constructed multi-level decision-tree structure in Excel 
software computing architecture that could estimate the option value and the relative optimal executive 
timing more quickly and with a better performance than expectation.

1. Introduction 
Refer to the UK Government Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) definition which 
describes the “creative industries” as: “those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, 
skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and 
exploitation of intellectual property.” (DCMS 2001, p.04).  Considered "intellectual property" 
implies a great uncertainty, and to make the decision to implement the new investment project in 
creativity industry that is irreversible to entrepreneurs and investors, that is, the project can not be use 
for any other purpose if it failed.  The creative industry firms must adopt strategic activities of ideas 
or technology innovations to reach competitive positions nowadays.  Apply the innovative activity is 
the main force and a formidable strategy in the creativity industry.  The innovative activities 
generally disclose a set of strategic investment opportunities accompanied with uncertain technology 
developments and market demands.  The necessary precursor for creative industry firms to capture 
excess profits is to endure the uncertain risks induced by some innovative activities and investment 
projects, such as realize the strategic activities of the ideas or technology innovations investment 
project for producing an album or movie. 
An effective strategic management for the strategic activities of the ideas or technology 
innovations investment project, involves various decisions such as which new ideas or technology to 
be adopted and when to implement it.  Problems, such as the intrinsic uncertainty for new technology, 
the inherent intangible nature of expected benefits, the availability of technical and economic 
information about the new technology, the need to develop new competencies and skills, the role 
played by learning process, and the irreversibility of the innovative investment, should all be taken 
into consideration in the decision making process (Scarso, 1996).  These imply that the amount of 
box-office revenue generated may be decreasing because the new idea/technology adoption is delayed 
or without any comparative competitive advantage.  Strictly speaking, the focus of this work will be 
the economic rents, i.e., the excess profit over the opportunity cost of capital.  Economic rents occur 
only if comparative competitive advantage exists.  Because the recurrent role played in influencing 
the strategic alternative for the competing products (or the other Movie Stars), innovative idea or 
technology is one of the main ways to achieve competitive advantage.  A creativity industry firm can 
capture the economic rents (the above-normal return) if the position with strategic benefit of 
innovative activities has been implemented. 
In short, the most of investment project in creative industries implies a considerable tremendous 
investment risk.  Furthermore, the “creative industry” firms expect the high levels box-office to 
  3 
Using the proposed procedure, an innovative ideas/technology strategy could be formulated 
accordingly.  A numerical case of an old-fashion comic story but a blockbuster movie: “Transformer” 
is provided as an example to demonstrate the proposed procedure.  There is a new wave about 
combined computer animation with live-action of competition lies ahead in the global movie industry, 
as most of the movie producers in the arena were ready to jump into construction of the world’s 
advanced visual effect in order to embrace the lucrative business opportunities generated by the 
old-fashion comic story.  One may postulate that if the film producer was in a slumped technology 
condition for advanced visual effects, it may be better to abandon/defer the project until the visual 
technology develops maturely in the future to start the project. 
The aim of this research is to propose a procedure using real option approach to evaluate the 
box-office for creativity industry under uncertainty.  The proposed procedure could be applied to 
price the innovative project and decide the appropriate adoption timing.  The literature review about 
real option approaches is shown in section2.  The strategic planning with the economic rent concepts 
under competition over time is studied in Section 3; we will adopt the real option approach in this 
section.  Section 4 contains a case about the movie producing investment project with the fantasy 
visual effect of an old old-fashion comic story: “Transformers” is provided as a numerical example to 
demonstrate the proposed procedure.  Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Section 5.

decision to exercise a financial option based on the option theory, because the new investment can be 
evaluated on the basis of the present and future opportunities it discloses and the adoption decision is 
taken when one can most profit from all the embedded options.  Scarso (1996) pointed out the real 
option approach appears to provide a powerful tool for the assessment of technology investments 
because it allows one to account for irreversibility and uncertainty, and explicitly recognizes that time 
affects the investment returns.  Real option approach has been considered by leading firms in natural 
resources, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, consumer electronics, and subsequently in most 
business areas, the practical use of real option analysis looks quite promising (Smit and Trigeorgis, 
2007). 
Cortazar et al. (1998) derived a real option model that determines when it is optimum for a firm at 
which output price level to invest in environmental technologies and which are the main parameters 
that affect this decision.  Cortazar et al. (1998) showed that firms require high output price levels to 
be induced to invest in environmental technologies, because they optimally would not want to commit 
to a heavy irreversible investment that could turn out to be unprofitable in the event of a price fall, 
furthermore, a comparative static analysis predicts that firms in industries with high output price 
volatility would be more reluctant to invest in environmental protection technologies.   
Cortazar, Schwartz and Casassus (2003) developed a real options model for valuing natural 
resource exploration investment (e.g. crude oil or copper) when there is joint price and 
geological-technical uncertainty under considering after a successful several-stage exploration phase 
which derives a development investment and extraction phase, however, all phases are optimized 
contingent on price and geological-technical uncertainty.  The model by Cortazar et al. (2003) 
maintains a relatively simple valuation structure by collapsing price and geological-technical 
uncertainty into a real options model which there are flexible investment schedules for all exploration 
stages and a timing option for the development investment.  For example, once the mine is developed, 
there are closure, opening and abandonment options for the extraction phase. 
To explore the firm's motivation to invest in a new technologies/products adoption, McGrath and 
Nerkar (2003) based on an analysis of a large sample of patents by firms active in the pharmaceutical 
industry, that their investments in R&D are consistent with the logic of real option approach, this study 
identified three constructs - scope of opportunity, prior experience, and competitive effects - which 
have an influence on firms' propensity to invest in new R&D options and which could usefully be 
incorporated in a strategic theory of investment.

rent and the irreversible condition.

innovative activities has been implemented.  Since the expected economic rents induced by 
innovative ideals/technology declines usually over time, any postponement for carrying out the 
innovative investment project may erode the value of the project. 
Simply combine equation (1) and (2), it follows that the expected box-office revenues (as the net 
operating cash inflows from the DCF methodology) could be represented as

The project value is discounted by the opportunity cost of capital: (k) of the IIIP.  Thus, the project 
present value (represented by 0V ) is as follows:

                 (4) 
Under perfect competition, the expected net operational cash inflows will change over time until the 
project earns just the opportunity cost of capital and their expected net present value will just be zero.  
A pioneer investment project of adopting innovative ideas or brand-new technology may produce only 
temporary economic rents.  Eventually, however, potential competitors will catch up and enter the 
industry sooner or later.  The producer will invest in a pilot project just to get an early foothold in the 
market; however, if the market opens up and creates expansion opportunities, the firm will increase 
capacity significantly by investing in a follow-up project.  This pioneering strategy involves high risk, 
but also involves low competition in the early stage of the market leading to substantial expected 
economic rents.  The timing of a project will be influenced by the development of market demand 
and the behavior of the competitor. 
So far, the optimal timing issue is rather trivial in equation (4), if there is no cost to deferring the 
innovative ideas/technology adoption, the producer (investors in creativity industry) would not 
undertake the deferrable investment project until the last moment.  The cost of deferring the project 
plays a role here similar to the role played by the dividend to an American call option (Lee, 1988).  It 
creates a wedge between the present value of the project to be is implemented now (represented by V0) 
or deferred to time t (represented by Vt) when the expected demand turns favorable under uncertainty.  
Base on this analogy, the option to defer investment in the IIIP is similar to a call option with a 
changing dividend payout ratio (Scarso, 1993).  Use δt,s to represent the dividend payout ratio at time 
t with shift magnitude sm , assume that the IIIP value will have a single up or down shift state (s) with 
the magnitude ms (represented by mu or md as the upward magnitude (u) or downward magnitude (d), 
respectively) and the possibility p (represented by upward possibility p and downward possibility 
  11 
deferred project at time t with 2t-1 kinds of option values with upward (muj) and downward (mdj) shift.  
Thus, there are three investment-timing alternatives at time t.  The project will not be worth to take if 
the option value equal to zero, i.e., the project should be abandoned.  If the project option value is 
equal to (Vt,Sj-I) ,the decision is to invest now.  The project should be postponed for further 
information under other condition.

4. Demonstrations with Numerical Example 
The aim of this paper is to propose a procedure using real option approach to evaluate the 
box-office for creativity industry under uncertainty.  The proposed real option pricing procedure 
could be applied to price the innovative ideas/technology project and decide the appropriate adoption 
timing with an innovative strategy could be formulated accordingly.  For example, one may postulate 
that if the film producer was in a slumped technology condition for expecting advanced visual effects, 
it may be better to abandon/defer the project until the visual technology develops maturely in the 
future to start the project.  Thus, we utilized a numerical case of an old-fashion comic story but a 
blockbuster movie: “Transformers”, is provided as an example to demonstrate the proposed 
procedure.   
“Transformers” is a series of American science fiction action films directed by Michael Bay, and 
based on the toys created by Hasbro and Takara Tomy.  This movie was distributed by Paramount 
Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures and was released in 2007.  “Transformers” induced a new wave of 
competition lies ahead in the global movie industry with combined computer animation with 
live-action, as most of the movie producers in the arena were ready to jump into construction of the 
world’s advanced visual effect in order to embrace the lucrative business opportunities generated by 
the old-fashion comic story.  Refer to Wikipedia1, this famous film received generally mixed to 
negative critical reception, with criticism focusing on the thin plots, undeveloped characters, crude 
humor and the lengths of the films.  Most critics, however, have praised the visuals and action 
sequences.  Although there were some of the negative reviews about this film, but the box office is 
very good, the worldwide box office revenue was $709,709,780; in contrast with such a relative low 
production budget was only $150,000,000.  Consider the great achievements of the box office, which 
can be a successful film and then the producers, would invest more and more capital to make a series 
of Transformers films.  
In such an environment, there is a decided preference for the maximization of box office revenues 
under the innovative ideas/technology adoption timing as an important objective.  For evaluating the 
box office revenues under uncertainty and irreversibility about the follow-up of the series of 
“Transformers” films, it was reported that the production budget of the first film of this series was 
only $150,000,000.  Using the predicted data of the capital expenditure and the net operating cash

5. Conclusion 
The focus of this work is the economic rents, i.e., the excess profit over the opportunity cost of 
capital; the economic rents occur only if comparative competitive advantage exists.  Because the 
recurrent role played in influencing the strategic alternative for the competitors, innovative 
ideas/technology is one of the main ways to achieve competitive advantage in creativity industry.  A 
new investment project sponsor/investors in creativity industry can capture the economic rents (the 
above-normal return) if the position with strategic benefit of innovative activities has been 
implemented under uncertain ideas/technology development progress, uncertain market demand, and 
irreversible cost.  An approach to evaluate the innovative project in creativity industry with the option 
pricing technique is proposed in this work, to simulate the uncertainty of the project using the 
volatility (standard deviation) of the project value.  We have also considered that the expected 
economic rents induced by innovative ideas/technology issues usually declines over time and postpone 
for carrying out the innovative issue may erode the value (e.g., as the box office) of the project.  
Appropriate investment timing will make a substantial influence on the competitive advantage induced 
by innovative issues.  The value of the ideas/technology innovation project as well as the optimal 
timing could be derived.  With the advantage of option pricing approach, decision makers can 
evaluate the project value and decide the investment timing using different degree of uncertainty.  
The results not only extend the advantage of keeping the future uncertainty simple but also 
provide the decision maker references for different level of uncertainty.  If the sponsor of this 
innovative project is confident in its own management ability as well as future ideas/technology 
development process of the project, that means this sponsor would like to take higher uncertainty.  
Larger standard deviation could be applied in deriving the project value and determining optimal 
timing.  On the other hands, if the sponsor is reluctant to take higher uncertainty, smaller standard 
deviation could be employed to evaluate the project value.  The research results of the numerical case 
of the first fantasy visual effect (which combined computer animation with live actions) with an old 
old-fashion comic story in the film industry “Transformers” was announced in 2007; suggested 
deferring the follow-up projects (i.e., the series of the Transformers Films) just under the downward 
worse market/technology condition.  It demonstrated the proposed procedure of this study could give 
the some counsel for investment decision-making analysis of the creativity industry because this 
industry is just focused on innovation issues.  Taking this real option approach to evaluate 
ideas/technology innovation investment project will complement the disadvantage of DCF method.  
Under the uncertain environment, our procedure could be applied to facilitate the decision of the
