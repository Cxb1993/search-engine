I. INTRODUCTION 
Magnetic films have attracted intensive research for their technical applications in 
magnetic recording media and sensors.1-4  Although most effort was focused on metallic 
layered systems, some oxide materials have also received attention.  A manganite oxide film 
of perovskite type – La2/3R1/3MnO3 (LRMO) with R = Sr, Ca, Ba – is considered a material 
with great potential due to its remarkable physical properties, such as the effect of colossal 
magnetoresistance (CMR), a Curie temperature (Tc) near 295 K, and spin-related electronic 
transport.5-8  The physical properties of these CMR films are known to be sensitive to lattice 
distortion and interfacial conditions. In particular, the ‘easy’ direction of magnetization varies 
with strain states that are tensile or compressive and is also highly correlated with the film 
lattice distortion.8,9  Researchers have recently focused on thin-film systems, especially films 
of multilayer structure. 
Periodic multilayer films, also called superlattices, have been increasingly investigated 
because of intrinsic interest in coupling mechanisms and the effects of finite size.  Such a 
superlattice structure consisting of a ferromagnetic layer and a paramagnetic or 
anti-ferromagnetic layer possesses properties quite different from those of a single layer or the 
bulk;10 for example, a much broader transition temperature produces a larger 
magnetoresistance (MR) ratio over a large temperature range, or an interlayer-coupling effect 
that occurs in hysteresis loops varies with spacer thickness.11-16 
Among various oxide materials of the perovskite type, La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and LaNiO3 have 
attracted much attention because La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 is a ferromagnetic metallic phase, whereas 
LaNiO3 is a paramagnetic metallic phase near 300 K; LaNiO3 can serve as not only an 
interlayer spacer but also a buffer layer that assists La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 to form epitaxial 
superlattice films.17-22  A small lattice mismatch between manganites and nickelates, 
together with their chemical stability, makes possible the fabrication of high-quality epitaxial 
heterostructures consisting of alternate layers of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and LaNiO3.  In our 
previous work, magnetic- oxide superlattices of high quality consisting of ferromagnetic 
oxide La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) and paramagnetic oxide LaNiO3 (LNO) were grown on a 
SrTiO3 (STO) substrate by rf magnetron sputtering in a temperature range 300 – 750 ℃.23 
As little information on superlattice films, prepared by rf sputtering, incorporating CMR 
manganites and other perovskite oxides is available, the investigation of magnetic properties 
versus the strain dependence of superlattice films prepared by rf sputtering on a microscopic 
scale is of great significance for the development of materials in this new class.  Much 
research on magnetic properties correlated with strain has focused mostly on the dependence 
on thickness, but it is difficult to distinguish whether the variation of magnetic properties is 
caused by lattice distortion or increasing thickness, as magnetic properties approach bulk 
values with increasing film thickness.  To discriminate between magnetic properties based 
on thickness from those on strain dependence, we fabricated LSMO/LNO superlattices and 
varied the deposition temperature to observe the crystallinity of the films based on the same 
architecture.  According to measurements of X-ray reflectivity and diffraction, all these 
films have a repeating periodic structure and epitaxy; a strain state that varies with deposition 
temperature is observable with grazing incident X-ray diffraction patterns.  Measurements of 
hysteresis loops and magnetization versus temperature indicate their variability due to the 
strain states. 
 
II. EXPERIMENTS 
Sputtering targets of LaNiO3 and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 were prepared according to a 
conventional solid reaction; each was sintered as a calcined mixed powder in a stoichiometric 
molar proportion.  The target had a diameter 50 mm and a thickness 3 mm; the substrate 
from –1 T to 1 T at 10 K. 
 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 1 exhibits the specular component of x-ray reflectivity of a LSMO/LNO superlattice 
with varied deposition temperature, measured on continuous momentum transfer along the 
surface normal direction, and their best-fit results.  A typical shape of superlattice structure 
was obtained for which the Bragg peaks are separated by Keissig fringes, which provides 
evidence for a vertically periodic modulation of composition.  The diffuse scattering of each 
curve was measured and subtracted carefully before simulation.

Figure 4 Crystal-truncation-rod spectrum of LSMO/LNO superlattice films with varied temperature of 
deposition; (a) along the plane normal (out-of-plane) (002) Bragg peak, (b) along the (200) in-plane Bragg peak.  
The arrows indicate the position of the superlattice main peak. 
Using grazing-incidence scattering geometry, we studied the epitaxial relation also from 
in-plane x-ray scans on these superlattice films.  The distribution of in-plane x-ray intensity 
of radial scans from superlattice films with varied deposition temperatures are shown in Fig. 
4(b).  The scan was performed in the vicinity of the STO (200) Bragg peak; the angle of 
incidence was fixed at 0.3° with respect to the sample surface during the measurement.  A 
broad feature coexists with a sharp Bragg peak, which originates from the substrate.  This 
broad feature, indicated by arrows in Fig. 4(b), is ascribed to the Bragg peak of the deposited 
layer, which is confirmed by the variation of relative intensity between the two peaks as a 
function of angle of incidence.  Furthermore, azimuthal scans (φ scan, not shown here) of all 
superlattice films in the vicinity of a surface peak and the substrate Bragg peak clearly exhibit 
a four-fold symmetry with the same orientation.  These results provide firm evidence for a 
strongly epitaxial layer deposited on the substrate.  No other feature was observed in the 
intervals between the four peaks, indicating a perfect alignment of a and b axes of LSMO and 
LNO unit cells along those of the STO substrate. 
The LSMO and LNO films are describable as having a pseudo-cubic structure, with a 
bulk lattice parameter 0.3841 nm for LSMO and 0.3861 nm for LNO; both are less than 
0.3905 nm characteristic of the single-crystal substrate STO.  The expected mean lattice 
parameter (amean) of superlattice film is calculated according to  
mean LSMO,bulk LNO,bulk
2 1 1= +
a a a
                     (1)   
With the bulk values of LSMO and LNO inserted therein, we thus calculated amean = 0.3851 
nm, indicated as a dashed line in Fig. 4.  The arrows in Fig. 4 indicate the position of the 
main peaks of the LSMO/LNO superlattice films.26,27  The position of the out-of-plane (002) 
main feature for all superlattice films [marked with arrows in Fig. 4(a)] is larger than the 
mean value of the superlattice film and away from the STO substrate Bragg peak with 
increasing deposition temperature.  This condition indicates that the superlattice films 
become subject to increased compressive stress along the c-axis (plane normal direction) on 
increasing the deposition temperature.  In contrast, the position of the in-plane main peak for 
all superlattice films [marked with arrows in Fig. 4(b)] is smaller than the mean value of the 
superlattice and approaches the STO substrate Bragg peak with increasing temperature of 
deposition.  On increasing the temperature of deposition the superlattice films hence become 
subject to increased tensile stress parallel to the surface plane.  These results clearly show 
that, with increasing temperature of deposition, the superlattices become subject to a greater 
compressive stress along the c-axis and more tensile stress parallel to the surface plane. 
Superlattice films deposited at a higher temperature have thus a more greatly strained state 
than films deposited at a lower temperature.

in which εxx denotes the strain ratio for the in-plane lattice and εzz denotes that ratio for 
the out-of-plane lattice.  The c-axis lattice parameter of the LSMO is not derivable from the 
plane normal scans because of the superlattice effect, but the in-plane lattice parameters of 
LSMO and LNO are obtainable from the in-plane patterns because one main feature is 
represented instead of two; LSMO and LNO are thus expected to be under almost fully 
strained conditions with each other in the in-plane direction.  Through eq. (2) and (3), the 
individual c-axis lattice parameter of LSMO is obtainable, for which purpose the Poisson 
coefficient (ν) of LSMO is 0.35.30

These hysteresis loops indicate a variation of magnetocrystalline anisotropy with 
deposition temperature.  Some authors indicated that a manganite film grown on a flat STO 
(100) substrate exhibits biaxial anisotropy with the ‘easy axis’ along [110].32,33  Figure 10 
shows the coercive field (left axis) and strain ratio (right axis) from LSMO lattice distortion 
as a function of deposition temperature.  The superlattice films deposited at a temperature 
below 650 ℃ also reveal biaxial magnetic anisotropy in the plane because of the hard axis 
features under the magnetic field along the [100] direction.  The slope of (∂M/∂H)at Hc 
typically determines whether the magnetic moment is readily flipped.34,35  As the deposition 
temperature increases to 650 ℃, the slope of these loops decreased, indicating that the 
easy-axis magnetization seems to alter its direction from the applied field.  The magnetic 
anisotropy is aligned toward the [110] direction as deposition temperature increases because 
of the increased strain ratio.  Other evidence of the changed easy-axis is observable from the 
coercive field (Hc) increasing with strain ratio, but the increasing Hc might result from many 
factors, such as inhomogeneity or dislocations inside the material, and lattice distortion.36  
Furthermore, the rocking curves of the superlattice films (Fig. 5) deposited at or below 550 
℃ almost overlap, indicating that those films have nearly the same crystal quality, and an 
even better crystalline quality for the film deposited at 650 ℃, but we did not find that Hc 
decreased with increasing crystallinity.  The results fail to tally with a concept according to 
which the existence of inhomogeneity or dislocations would enlarge Hc.  The coercive field 
is thus governed mainly by a strain effect, instead of defects such as inhomogeneity or 
dislocations in our systems.  The tendency of a strain-governed coercive curve is observed in 
other epitaxial magnetic perovskite film systems.37,38 
Hc of the sample deposited at 750℃ shows a tendency opposite from above.  A likely 
cause involves small, magnetic, self-organized LSMO grains distributed on the surface, 
similar to the definition of a super-paramagnet for which these grains are as small as 
nanoparticle size, but a slight difference persists from a super-paramagnet because of the 
presence of a hysteresis loop instead of an anti-hysteresis curve.  The pronounced decrease 
of Hc is supposed to indicate that these grains are viewable as many single ferromagnetic 
domains, and the magnetic moments are readily flipped with the direction of the applied field.  
Besides, the slope of (∂M/∂H)at Hc that rapidly increases and presents much more nearly 
square loops describes that the anisotropy tends toward the [100] direction for a temperature 
of deposition above 650℃.  Such a change is ascribed to the difference caused by origins of 
anisotropy.  In general, the anisotropy of thin films is divisible into three parts – the surface 
or interface anisotropy parameter, Ks, the volume anisotropy parameter, Kv, and the shape 
anisotropy, µ0 M.  We obtain the effect of the anisotropy parameter K on summing the three

1. Introduction
Manganite oxide films of the perovskite type are fascinating
materials with diverse transport and magnetic properties; they
have been the subject of much intensive research due to both
magnetic or electric properties of a magnetic oxide, such as
substrate-induced strain that influences the Curie temperature
(Tc), magnetic anisotropy and resistivity of magnetic films
[4,11–13].
Apart from the mechanism of FM/AF coupling, the resultantepitaxial relationship between the film and the substrate. The clearly discernible main feature and satellite features observed in the (002) crystal-
truncation-rod indicate the high quality of the LCMO/LNO artificial superlattice structure formed on a SrTiO3 substrate. Hysteresis measurements
show magnetic properties to be highly correlated with interfacial strain between the substrate and the film: the smaller is the LNO spacer thickness,
the larger is the in-plane lattice strain of the films present, and the larger is the ratio of remnant magnetization to saturation magnetization and theStructural and magnetic properties

Fig. 3. The main peak and satellite peaks that are accompanied

3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 shows reflectivity curves of LCMO/LNO superlattice
films deposited on STO substrate with varied LNO spacer layers
and their best fitted results. In each curve, the diffuse scattering
was measured and subtracted, so that the data points represent
only the specular component. Both the superlattice peaks and
the Kiessig oscillations, which were well pronounced, reveal the
presence of a well ordered layer structure of superlattice,
providing evidence for a vertically periodic modulation of the
composition.
The simulation of specular reflectivity is based on the

7 nm thick.
H.-Y. Lee et al. / Surface & Coarecursive formalism of Parratt [20] to acquire the physical
parameters of the superlattice. In this work, we fitted the
reflectivity data with the BedeREFS Mercury code [21] to
determine physical parameters of the superlattice, including
roughness, thickness and density. The best fitted results are
shown in Table 1. According to these fitted data, the densities of
the LCMO and LNO sublayers are slightly less than their bulk
values; this condition likely reflects an increased density of
defects inevitably occurring during deposition of a thin film at
high temperature [18,22,23]. According to Table 1 the surface
layer notably exhibits an increasing surface roughness, δ, with
increasing thickness of LNO spacer layer.
To confirm the vertically periodicmodulation obtained from the
X-ray reflectivity, we examined the vertical composition profile of
the superlattices with secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). A
SIMS depth profile of the (LCMO7 nm/LNO7 nm)×10 superlattice
sample is shown in Fig. 2. The variations of signals of La, Ca, Mn
and Ni are consistent with the designed period of 10 cycles of
LCMO/LNO superlattice. The modulation length (Λ) obtained
from the SIMS depth profile is ∼134 nm, which is satisfactorily
consistent with the fitted result of the reflectivity curve shown in
Table 1, i.e.,Λ=(tLCMO+ tLNO)×10=(6.65+6.6)×10=132.5 nm.

The scan was performed in the neighborhood of the STO (200)
Bragg peak; the angle of incidence was fixed at 0.3° with
respect to the sample surface during the measurement. A broad
peak coexists with the sharp Bragg peak, which originates from
the substrate. This broad feature, indicated by arrows in Fig. 4,
is ascribed to the Bragg peak of the deposited layer, which is
confirmed by the variation of relative intensity between the two
peaks as a function of angle of incidence. The azimuthal
diffraction patterns of a (LCMO7 nm/LNO2 nm)10 superlattice
film in the vicinity of a surface peak and the substrate Bragg
peak clearly exhibiting a four-fold symmetry with the same
orientation appear in the inset of Fig. 4. These results constitute
firm evidence for strong epitaxy of the deposited layer on the
substrate. No other peaks are observed in the intervals between
the four peaks, indicating a perfect alignment of a and b axes of
LCMO and LNO unit cells along those of the STO substrate.
The LCMO and LNO films have a pseudo-cubic structure
with bulk lattice parameters 0.3866 nm and 0.3850 nm for
LCMO and LNO, respectively; both are less than 0.3905 nmFig. 3. Intensity distribution of a (002) crystal-truncation-rod spectrum of

With the bulk values of LCMO and LNO [24,25] inserted
therein, we thus calculated amean=0.3858 nm, indicated as a
dashed line in Fig. 4. The position of the in-plane main peak for
all superlattice films (marked with arrows in Fig. 4) is smaller
than the mean value of the superlattice and approaches the STO
substrate Bragg peak with decreasing thickness of the LNO
spacer layer. This condition indicates that the superlattice films
become subject to increased tensile stress parallel to the surface
plane on decreasing the thickness of the LNO spacer layer.
Fig. 5 shows hysteresis loops measured at T=10 K for
superlattices with a ferromagnetic layer (LCMO) of fixed
thickness and a spacer layer (LNO) of varied thickness. During
these measurements, a magnetic field was applied parallel to the
in-plane [100] direction of each superlattice film. A small non-
hysteretic contribution from the STO substrate was eliminated
on separately measuring its diamagnetic response. The mea-
surement of these hysteresis loops shows that the ratio of
remnant magnetization to saturation magnetization (Mr/Ms) and
coercive field (Hc) decreased with increasing thickness of the
spacer layer. The measurement of X-ray diffraction in-plane at
grazing incidence shows that stress would be relieved on
increasing the thickness of the spacer layer. Several reports
indicate that some manganite films grown on a STO substrate
under tensile stress cause the magnetic easy-axis to lie in the in-
plane [100] direction [12,26]; hence the decreasing Mr/Ms ratio
with increasing spacer thickness represents that the magnetic
anisotropy would be away from the [100] direction as strain is
relieved. The measurement of these hysteresis loops shows also
the smaller is the LNO spacer thickness, the more square like is
the shape of hysteresis loops and the higher fields are required to
saturate the magnetization. As discussed by Padhan et al., the
large saturation field and low remnant magnetization (Mr) seen
in the superlattice films may be indicative of antiferromagnetic
exchange coupling between the LCMO layer [27,28]. Therefore,
the change in the shape of the hysteresis loops could interpret as
a signature of antiferromagnetic coupling [10,13,29]. Besides,
the tendency of a decreasing Hc with varied Mr/Ms in our work
implies the rotational magnetic moment occurred while the
magnetic field applied in this system that is consistent with the
model of Stoner and Wohlfarth [30,31]; the state of increased
strain thus has also improved epitaxity, and so can be viewed as
similar to a single domain. One can thus derive that increasing
the strain causes increased spontaneous magnetic moments
arranging toward the theoretical easy-axis [100].
4. Conclusion
H.-Y. Lee et al. / Surface & CoaBy rf magnetron sputtering, we have grown an artificial
superlattice consisting of LCMO/LNO magnetic oxide super-
lattices with alternating stacks of ferromagnetic LCMO sublayer
Please cite this article as: H.-Y. Lee et al., Surf. Coat. Technol. (2007), doi:10.10(thickness 7 nm) and LNO spacer (thicknesses 1.5–7 nm) on
SrTiO3 (001) substrates. The formation of a superlattice structure
was confirmed through both the appearance of Bragg peaks
separated by Kiessig fringes in X-ray reflectivity curves and
satellite peaks of a (002) CTR and SIMS profile. A clearly
discernible main peak and the satellite peaks on both sides of the
main peak in a (002) CTR indicate the high quality of the LCMO/
LNO artificial superlattice structure formed on a STO substrate
with RF sputtering. The measurement of X-ray diffraction in-
plane at grazing incidence shows that the superlattice film had an
increasingly strained state with decreasing thickness of the spacer
layer. The measurement of hysteresis loops shows that the ratio of
remnant magnetization to saturation magnetization (Mr/Ms) and
coercive field (Hc) decreased on increasing the thickness of the
spacer layer. Measurements of hysteresis loop show thatmagnetic
properties are highly correlated with the interfacial strain between
the substrate and the film.
