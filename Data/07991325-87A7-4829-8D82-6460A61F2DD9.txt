Introduction 
Submicron polymer particles 
exhibiting an exceedingly large particle 
surface area per unit mass of polymer 
have been evaluated as a potential 
polymeric support for purification of 
protein from a crude biological mixture. 
Adsorption of protein onto the particle 
surface via the electrostatic interaction is 
the most widely used recovery method. 
A variety of positively charged or 
negatively charged polymer particles 
were synthesized and used to bind 
proteins.1-12 Homola and James13 
prepared and characterized amphoteric 
polystyrene (PS) latexes. Recently, 
Shirahama et al.14 and Fang and 
Kawaguchi15 adopted different synthesis 
routes to prepare amphoteric polymer 
particles and then studied their 
interactions with biomolecules. The 
literature related to the interactions 
between the amphoteric latex particles 
and proteins is rather limited. 
In our previous work,16 a series of 
amphoteric latexes were synthesized by 
the semibatch surfactant-free emulsion 
copolymerization of methyl 
methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic 
acid (MAA) initiated by 
2,2’-azobis(2-amidinopropane) 
dihydrochloride (V-50). The relatively 
hydrophilic polymethyl methacrylate 
(PMMA) was expected to give a smaller 
extent of protein adsorption via the 
nonspecific hydrophobic interaction 
compared to the PS counterpart. At low 
pH, these particles had a net positive 
charge due to the ionized amino group 
originating from V-50. At high pH, they 
became negatively charged due to the 
ionized carboxyl group originating from 
MAA. Thus, there existed a pH at which 
point these particles exhibited a net 
charge of zero (isoelectric point, IEP). 
The electrostatic interactions between 
these amphoteric particles and various 
proteins were then investigated17 The 
nature and degree of interactions 
between the particles and proteins were 
primarily controlled by the electrostatic 
characteristics of the polymeric supports 
and proteins under the experimental 
conditions. It was also proposed that the 
isoelectric point (pI) of an unknown 
protein sample could be determined 
based on the unique colloidal instability 
phenomenon caused by the electrostatic 
attraction forces between the particles 
and protein molecules. The objective of 
this work was therefore to study the 
feasibility of using single amphoteric 
latex of known IEP to determine the pI 
value of protein. The results obtained 
from this work may also contribute to 
the fundamental understanding of the 
complicated interactions between the 
particles and proteins. 
 
Experimental 
Materials  
Two monodisperse amphoteric PMMA 
latexes with similar particle sizes and 
particle size distributions but different 
IEP values (abbreviated as PMMA1 and 
PMMA2) were prepared, purified and 
 2
determine whether the network structure 
of aggregates forms in the protein 
adsorption process or not. 
The data of the absorbance at 560 
nm and ζ of the PMMA1 particles in the 
presence of lysozyme are shown in Fig. 
3. The difference between the IEP of the 
PMMA1 particle (5.2) and the pI of the 
model protein lysozyme (11) is 5.8. 
Although not very distinct, two 
characteristic peaks can be identified in 
the absorbance of the PMMA1 particles 
in the presence of lysozyme at 560 nm 
versus pH data; one corresponds to the 
pI of lysozyme and the other presumably 
originates from the amphoteric nature of 
the PMMA1 particles (Fig. 3a). At pH < 
5.2, both the PMMA1 particles and 
lysozyme molecules are positively 
charged and, therefore, the exceedingly 
retarded adsorption of lysozyme 
molecules on the PMMA1 particle 
surfaces is experienced due to the strong 
electrostatic repulsion force between the 
PMMA1 particle and lysozyme. As pH 
approaches 5.2, the greatly reduced ζ 
induces the flocculation of colloidal 
particles, thereby leading to the rapid 
increase of the absorbance at 560 nm. It 
should be noted that the point at which 
the first maximal absorbance at 560 nm 
occurs is shifted to a pH value (ca. 5.5) 
that is slightly higher than the IEP of the 
PMMA1 particles in the absence of 
protein. This is most likely due to the 
adsorbed lysozyme molecules that 
impart additional positive charges to the 
PMMA1 particle surfaces. This is 
further supported by comparing the ζ 
versus pH data in the absence and 
presence of lysozyme in Figs. 1 and 3b, 
respectively. After the first maximal 
absoebance at 560 nm is reached, the 
colloid systems in the pH range ca. 5.5-9 
are still unstable as a consequence of the 
following two competitive processes. 
First, in the absence of protein, charge 
reversal of the PMMA1 particles (＋ → 
－ ) occurs at pH 5.2 and then 
the∣ζ∣of the PMMA1 particles 
increases with increasing pH (Fig. 1). 
However, adsorption of the positively 
charged lysozyme molecules onto the 
negatively charged PMMA1 particles 
(i.e., charge neutralization) becomes 
more important when pH increases from 
5.5 to 9. These two comparable effects 
counterbalance with each other and 
make the charge reversal of colloidal 
particles in the presence of lysozyme to 
occur at a higher pH value (Fig. 3b). In 
addition, the ζ data shown in Fig. 3b also 
indicate that both the electrostatic 
repulsion (5.5 < pH < 7) and attraction 
(7 < pH < 9) forces between the 
PMMA1 particle and lysozyme are 
rather weak in this region. These unique 
characteristics of the colloidal particles 
in the presence of lysozyme are then 
reflected in the data of the absorbance at 
560 nm (Fig. 3a). 
In the pH range 9-10, the 
absorbance of colloidal particles in the 
presence of lysozyme at 560 nm 
increases again to the second maximum 
due to the significant charge 
 4
Beyond pH 7.1, both the PMMA2 
particles in the absence of pepsin and 
pepsin molecules carry negative charges 
(Fig. 1). Thus, the electrostatic repulsion 
force between the PMMA2 particle and 
pepsin predominates in the adsorption 
process. Retarded adsorption of pepsin 
molecules on the PMMA2 particles and, 
hence, stable colloidal systems in the 
presence of pepsin at pH > 7.1 are then 
expected. This is further supported by 
the low absorbance at 560 nm and 
high︱ζ︱of colloidal particles in the 
presence of pepsin at pH > 7.1 (Fig. 4). 
Interactions between PMMA2 
and BSA.   
The data of the absorbance at 560 
nm and ζ of the PMMA2 particles in the 
presence of BSA are shown in Fig. 5. It 
is noteworthy that the difference 
between the IEP of the PMMA2 particle 
in the absence of protein and the pI of 
the model protein BSA (5) is the 
smallest (2.1) among the amphoteric 
latex-protein pairs investigated in this 
work. In this case, only one distinct peak 
is observed in the absorbance of the 
PMMA2 particles in the presence of 
BSA at 560 nm versus pH data and the 
maximum seems to correspond to the pI 
of BSA (Fig. 5a). It is apparent that the 
difference between the IEP of the 
amphoteric particle and the pI of the 
protein has a significant effect on the 
number of peaks that can be identified in 
the absorbance of colloidal particles in 
the presence of protein at 560 nm versus 
pH profile. Nevertheless, the point at 
which the only maximal absorbance at 
560 nm occurs seems to correspond to 
the pI of the protein sample.  
At pH < 5, both the PMMA2 
particles in the absence of protein and 
BSA molecules are positively charged 
and, therefore, the electrostatic repulsion 
force between the PMMA2 particle and 
BSA (i.e., the retarded BSA adsorption) 
is operative in the adsorption process. 
However, the ζ of the PMMA2 particles 
in the absence of protein first remains 
relatively constant and then decreases 
with increasing pH. The surface charge 
density of BSA also decreases when pH 
increases from 3 to 5. As a result, the 
electrostatic repulsion force between the 
PMMA2 particle and BSA is greatly 
reduced and the amount of adsorbed 
BSA increases accordingly as the pH 
approaches 5. In this case, it is the 
hydrophobic interaction mechanism 
governs the BSA adsorption process. 
Furthermore, the electrostatic repulsion 
force between two approaching particles 
is not strong to maintain adequate 
colloidal stability when the pH 
approaches 5, as shown by the ζ data in 
Fig. 5b. As expected, the absorbance of 
colloidal particles in the presence of 
BSA at 560 nm increases rapidly to a 
maximum (occurring at ca. pH 5.5) 
when the pH approaches 5 (Fig. 5a).  
In the pH range 5-7.1, the PMMA2 
particles in the absence of protein 
remain positively charged (Fig. 1), but 
BSA molecules become negatively 
charged. Thus, the charge neutralization

electrostatic interactions between the 
amphoteric particles and protein 
molecules and the charge reversal of 
colloidal particles in the presence of 
protein species played an important role 
in the protein adsorption process. The 
mechanisms involved in the electrostatic 
interactions between the amphoteric 
latex particles and protein molecules 
were proposed to explain the observed 
colloidal phenomena.
