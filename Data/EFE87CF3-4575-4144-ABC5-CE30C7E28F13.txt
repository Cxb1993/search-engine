Abstract 
Manual materials handling is one of the major contributors to musculoskkelatal disorders in 
industry. This project was a three-year project. In the first year, a combined manual materials 
handling tasks experiment was performed under three frequency (1, 2, 3 per minute) and three 
footwear conditions. In the second year, a combined manual materials handling tasks experiment 
was performed under four lifting & lowering ranges (F-F, F-K, K-F, K-K) and three footwear 
conditions. In the third year, a combined manual materials handling tasks experiment was 
performed under three carrying distance (1, 3, or 8.5 m) and three footwear conditions. The 
maximum acceptable weight of handling, including lifting, carrying for, lowering, and walking back 
to the origin was determined. The subject then performed the same tasks for 10 minutes handling 
the maximum acceptable weight he has selected. The PSOS, VO2, heart rate, and rating of perceived 
exertion for whole body strain were measured. The results showed that the effects of frequency, 
lifting & lowering range, and carrying distance on the maximum acceptable weights of handling, 
heart rate, and VO2 were all statistically significant (p<0.05). The effects of frequency on RPE was, 
however, not significant. The effects of footwear was significant only for the PSOS.

This project was the final part of a three-year project. The focus of the study was to address the 
MMH tasks under different footwear-floor friction conditions and to test the job design parameters. 
In the first year, we conducted experiment testing the effects of footwear materials and frequency on 
the MAWH and both physiological and subjective responses of the subjects. In the second year, the 
lifting and lowering range was tested in addition to the footwear conditions. The objective of the 
study was to determine the maximum acceptable weight of handling when performing combined 
manual materials handling tasks and to determine the physiological and perceptual responses of the 
subjects in performing such a task.  
 
2. Experiment 1 
2.1 Methods 
 
Twelve male subjects, free from any cardiovascular and neuro-musculoskeletal disorders were 
recruited for this study. Their mean (±std) age, height, and body weight were 21.8 (±2.4) years, 
168.8 (±4.3) cm, and 64.2 (±14.2) Kg, respectively. All participants signed an informed consent, 
and were compensated financially for their participation in the study. The temperature and humidity 
in the laboratory was 21~23°C and 47~64%, respectively.

2.1.3 Experiment design & data analysis 
The experiment was conducted using a two-factor completely randomized design. In addition 
to descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and descriptive statistics were performed.  
Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) tests were conducted if a factor was found significant 
in the ANOVA. The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
®
 14.0 computer software.  
 
2.2 Results 
 
Table 2.1 shows the ANOVA results for all the dependent variables in experiment 1. Frequency 
was a significant factor affecting MAWH (p<0.0001), VO2 (p<0.0001), and HR (p<0.001) but not 
for RPE and PSOS. Footwear material was a significant factor affecting the PSOS (p<0.0001).

3. Experiment 2 
3.1 Methods 
 
Twelve male subjects, free from any cardiovascular and neuro-musculoskeletal disorders were 
recruited for this study. Their mean (±std) age, height, and body weight were 21.0 (±0.7) years, 
172.8 (±6.3) cm, and 66.3 (±11.1) Kg, respectively. All participants signed an informed consent, and 
were compensated financially for their participation in the study. The temperature and humidity in 
the laboratory was 21~23°C and 47~64%, respectively. 
 
3.1.1Manual Materials Handling Tasks 
 
The same plastic container and sand bags used in section 2.2 was used. The subject was also 
required to lift the container with a certain amount of weight and carry it for 3 m, then lower the 
container onto a height. The subject then walked back 3 m, empty-handed, to the original starting 
position. In other words, one task included a lifting, carrying for 3 m, lowering, and walking 
empty-handed for 3 m. The frequency of this task was 2 per minute. The lifting and lowering range 
included lifting from floor and lowering onto floor (F-F), lifting from floor and lowering onto 
knuckle height (F-K), lifting from knuckle height and lowering onto floor (K-F), and lifting from 
knuckle height and lowering onto the knuckle height (K-K). In addition to the lifting & lowering 
range, the three types of same shoes were used. The walking speeds of the subjects were not 
controlled. However, they were required to complete two tasks each minute and were instructed to 
maintain consistent working and walking pace during the experiment.  
 
3.1.2 Procedure  
Similar procedure as in section 2.3 was adopted.  
 
3.1.3 Experiment design & data analysis 
The experiment was conducted using a two-factor completely randomized design. In addition 
to descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and descriptive statistics were performed.  
Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) tests were conducted if a factor was found significant 
in the ANOVA. The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS

Table 3.3 shows the Tukey’s HSD results for VO2. The VO2 for F-F (721.53±160.47 ml/min) 
was significantly (p<0.05) higher than those of M-F (605.21±107.49 ml/min) and M-M (573.49±
121.16 ml/min). The MAWH for both the F-M (8.35±1.41 kg) and M-F (8.20±1.40 kg) were not 
significantly different from both the MAWH of F-F and M-M.

Table 3.3 shows the Tukey’s HSD results for heart rate. The HR for F-F (721.53±160.47 
ml/min) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than those of M-F (100.93±9.76 bpm) was significantly 
higher than that of M-M (94.36±8.70 bpm). The MAWH for both the F-M (98.59±10.38 bpm) and 
M-F (95.90±9.53 bpm) were not significantly different from both the MAWH of F-F and M-M.

The Tukey’s HSD results for PSOS testing against footwear shows that the cloth-soled (2.8) 
footwear had a significant higher PSOS rating than those of the other two footwear materials (1.8 
and 1.7).  
 The Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coefficients between the MAWH and RPE were 
-0.30 (p<0.01) and -0.376 (p<0.01), respectively. The Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation 
coefficients between the PSOS and RPE were 0.26 (p<0.01) and 0.31 (p <0.01), respectively.

Tukey’s HSD tests results indicated that the MAWH at 1 m carrying distance (8.8 kg) was 
significantly (p<0.05) higher than those of 3m (8.1 kg) and 8.5m (6.9 kg). The MAWH for the 3m 
distance was significantly (p<0.05) higher than that of the 8.5 m.  
The ANOVA results showed that both footwear (p<0.0001) and carrying distance (p<0.01) were 
significant affecting the PSOS (see Table 4.2). For the VO2, the effects of distance was significant 
(p<0.0001) but the effects of footwear was not significant (see Table 4.3). For the heart rate, the 
effects of distance was also significant (p<0.0001) but the effects of footwear was not significant 
(see Table 4.4). Both the effects of footwear and carrying distance on the RPE were not significant.

The results of the study indicated that footwear did not affect the MAWH, VO2, heart rate, and 
RPE significantly. Lifting and lowering height, however, was a significant factor affecting the 
MAWH, VO2, and heart rate. Lifting from the floor and lowering onto the floor was the most 
stressful condition among all lifting and lowering conditions. This was consistent with the finding 
in the literature [23-25] that either squatting or bending toward floor level to reach the weight and 
lift it resulted in high stress on the physiological system which may be monitored from the 
physiological measures such as VO2 and heart rate. 
The results showed that the carrying distance of 8.5 m had significantly higher MAWH than 
those of the other two distances and the 3 m distance had higher MAWH than that of 1m. This was 
not unexpected as longer walking distance required higher metabolic energy and physical efforts 
and would result in a lower weigh could be handled by the subject.  
One of our hypotheses was that the shoe soles possessing different slip-resistance affect the 
MAWH as extra efforts were required to maintain bodily balance when the friction was inadequate. 
This hypothesis was not supported by our data. The possible reason may be that the difference 
between the frictions among the shoe soles selected was not different enough so as to generate 
different results. Future research may be required to test more footwear materials so as to realize 
whether such a hypothesis would be supported in a more general footwear condition.  
The overall mean RPE was 12.78, which corresponded to a level between “light” to “somewhat 
hard.” This RPE level was slightly lower than that (13) in one of our previous studies [18]. The 
college students in the current study carried 6.9 to 8.8 Kg which was lower than those in Li et al. 
[18] where their subjects handled weights ranged 7.8 to 10.7 Kg. The subjects in the former seemed 
to perceive a slightly lower whole body strain than the one in the current study. The college students 
in our study seemed to perceive their whole body strain slightly differently than the previous study 
[18].  
The VO2 results in the current study indicated that the energy expenditure of the subjects 
handling their MAWH was significantly affected by the carrying distance. This was reasonable. The 
implication was that load carrying should be performed using a cart instead of carrying manually. 
Load carrying should be minimized so as to reduce the physical burden of the workers.  
There were limitations to this study. First of all, the results of the study should be taken as 
indicative because of the relative small sample size. Secondly, the walking velocities were not 
controlled. Variations of walking velocity might exist among the tasks performed in each session 
which might affect the results of the study.

On dry vinyl and terrazzo floors tested, the COF
values decreased after a six month usage for both of
the rubber and EVA samples. The COF values also
decreased for the same period for EVA samples
under wet conditions on both floors. The COF of
the used rubber samples increased, however, on wet
vinyl and terrazzo floors as compared to their new
counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS
The differences of abrasion between new and used
shoe soles were not statistically significant. The
used shoe soles, however, had significant lower
COF values than the new ones except the rubber
soles tested on wet vinyl and terrazzo floors.

1 Musculoskeletal problems are very common in 
industries. In a survey conducted on construction sites in 
northern Taiwan [1], ninety-seven percent of the 
interviewees had experienced musculoskeletal symptoms 
over the previous 12 months. Half of these interviewees 
had their symptoms treated by medical personnel, with 
low back pain as the leading body symptom reported. 
Aches in the upper extremities were also very common 
 
Abstract - A study on combined manual materials 
handling tasks performed on floors under three footwear 
and four lifting and lowering height conditions. Twelve male 
subjects participated in the study. The maximum acceptable 
weight of handling, including lifting, carrying for 3 m, 
lowering, and walking 3 m back at 2 per minute was 
determined. The subject then performed the same tasks for 
10 minutes. The VO2, heart rate, and rating of perceived 
exertion for whole body strain were measured. The results 
showed that the effects of footwear on the maximum 
acceptable weights of handling (MAWH), heart rate, and 
VO2 were not significant. The effects of lifting and lowering 
height on all dependent variables except rating of perceived 
exertion were statistically significant (p≤0.027). Lifting from 
the floor and lowering on the floor condition was the most 
stressful condition than all other lifting and lowering 
condition. The subjects had the lowest MAWH on this 
condition. In addition, lifting from the floor and lowering on 
the floor condition resulted in the highest physiological 
responses including both VO2 and heart rate. The effects of 
lifting and lowering height on RPE was, however, not 
significant. The implication of this study was that lifting 
and lowering height should be regarded as one of the 
major job factors in designing MMH tasks as it 
affected physiological responses of the subjects. This is 
consistent with the findings in the literature.

[2], suggesting the urgent need for investigating safety 
and health issues among these workers.   
The MMH tasks are very common on construction 
sites and on other types of workplaces [3], and are one of 
the major contributors for musculoskeletal symptoms for 
workers [1]. Workers manually handle construction 
materials, including cement, brick, steel, wood, and others 
[4]. The MMH tasks at construction sites normally have a 
high degree of variability, both in duration and content [1, 
5, 6]. This complexity in construction work makes 
ergonomics interventions much more complicated as 
compared to those in the manufacturing and service 
sectors.  
One of the most widely accepted approaches in 
designing MMH tasks is to design or modify a job so as 
not to exceed the capabilities of the materials handlers [7-
11]. Physiological measures are one of the scientific 
means to evaluate the physical burdens and capabilities of 
workers in MMH tasks under various job conditions. In 
the physiological approach, a job is usually divided into 
simple individual tasks, and the physiological cost of the 
job is assumed to be the sum of the energy expenditures 
of these individual tasks. Many researchers have 
developed regression equations to predict oxygen 
consumption using personal, task, and workplace 
variables based on this assumption. The most 
comprehensive and flexible predictive equations in the 
MMH tasks were developed in 1978 by Garg et al [12].  
Subjective measures may be used to quantify the physical 
strain caused by physical activities. The ratings of 
perceived exertion (RPE) developed by Borg [13] has 
been one the most commonly used subjective measures in 
assessing the whole body and segmental strain. The RPE 
is constructed so that the ratings, 6 to 20, are linearly 
related to the heart rate expected for that level of exertion. 
As indicated by Hutchinson and Tenenbaum [14], a single 
measure of RPE is insufficient to capture the whole range 
of perceptual sensations that people experience when 
exercising or being physically active. There are numerous 
examples of using the RPE as supplementary measures in 
addition to some objective measures in studying the 
MMH tasks [15-18] and other physical phenomena and 
activities [19-20]. The objective of the study was to 
determine the maximum acceptable weight of handling 
when performing combined manual materials handling 
tasks and to determine the physiological and perceptual 
responses of the subjects in performing such a task under 
different footwear and lifting and lowering height 
conditions.

footwear was not statistically significant. The effect of 
lifting and lowering height was significant (p<0.0001). 
The mean (±std) MAWH for F-F, F-K, K-F, and K-K 
were 7.52 (±1.38), 8.35 (±1.41), 8.20 (±1.40), and 9.02 
(±1.42) kg, respectively (see Fig. 2). Tukey’s HSD test 
results showed that F-F condition had significant higher 
MAWH than that of the K-K condition.   
For VO2, the ANOVA results of the study showed the 
effect of footwear was not statistically significant. The 
effect of lifting and lowering height was significant 
(p<0.0001).  The mean (±std) VO2 for F-F, F-K, K-F, and 
K-K were 721.53 (±160.47), 652 (±129.18), 605.21 
(±107.49), and 573.49 (±121.16) ml/min, respectively 
(see Fig. 3). Tukey’s HSD test results showed that F-F 
condition had significant higher VO2 than those of all 
other lifting and lowering conditions. The difference 
among F-K, K-F, and K-K conditions were not 
statistically significant.  
For heart rate, the ANOVA results of the study showed 
the effect of footwear was not statistically significant. The 
effect of lifting and lowering height was significant 
(p=0.027).  The mean (±std) heart rate for F-F, F-K, K-F, 
and K-K were 100.93 (±9.76), 98.59 (±10.38), 95.90 
(±9.53), and 94.36 (±8.70) beats/min, respectively (see 
Fig. 4). Tukey’s HSD test results showed that F-F 
condition had significant higher heart rate than those of all 
other lifting and lowering conditions. The difference 
among F-K, K-F, and K-K conditions were not 
statistically significant.  
For RPE, the ANOVA results of the study showed the 
effect of both footwear and lifting and lowering height 
were not statistically significant.  The range of RPE was 
between 9 and 15. Most trials were rated as 11 or 12 
indicating that the subjects felt the task was light.

Abstract - A friction measurement experiment was 
conducted using the Brungraber Mark II slipmeter. The 
coefficient of friction (COF), the time and velocity of slipping 
of the footwear sample on the floor were measured under 
four floors and two surface conditions. Two operators 
performed the measurements separately. The results showed 
that there were no significant differences between the two 
operators in measuring all the dependent variables. The 
ANOVA results showed that the floor, surface conditions, 
and their interactions affected the COF and velocity of 
slipping significantly (p<0.05). The Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient between the COF and the slipping velocity of the 
footwear sample was -0.81 (p<0.0001). This implied that fast 
slipping was associated with low COF value. The slipping 
time and velocity of the footwear sample provided a basis to 
train the operators in making the slip and non-slip judgment.  
They are also helpful in developing an automatic friction 
measurement device that require slip/non-slip judgment.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Slip and fall accidents create significant occupational 
safety & health problems [1][2][3]. Slips normally occur 
when the friction at the footwear-floor interface is 
inadequate. Determination of coefficient of friction (COF), 
or friction measurement, has been one of the major 
approaches in studying slip & fall incidences. Friction 
measurements on horizontal surfaces, especially under 
liquid-contaminated conditions, both in laboratory and in 
the field have been reported. It was also known that most 
slipping and falling occurred on horizontal surfaces [2][4]. 
Measurement of floor slip slipperiness is very importance 
in determining the risk of slipping and falling incidents.  
Friction measurement is one of the major approaches 
in determining floor slipperiness[5]. Even though 
numerous friction measurement devices, or slipmeters, 
have been designed and fabricated, none of them has been 
universally accepted as a perfect one in determining floor 
slipperiness[6][7]. All of the friction measurement devices 
have advantages and disadvantages. Different friction 
measurement devices provide different readings even at 
the same footwear material-floor interface. 
 The Brungraber Mark II (see Fig. 1) has been one of 
the friction measurement devices commonly used in the 
USA [7][8]. The BM II is a portable, inclinable, 
articulated strut slip tester (PIAST).       The operating

principle of this tester is to simultaneously apply forces 
parallel and normal to a floor surface by impacting a 
footwear pad on the floor. A weight of 4.54 kg drives an 
inclined-strut to impact the floor surface at an inclined 
angle to the vertical. The footwear sample is 
approximately 7.62 cm × 7.62 cm and is within a height 
of 3.175 to 6.35 mm from the floor surface. The angle of 
the strut is increased until a slip occurs on impact. The 
starting angle should be smaller than the angle at which a 
slip is anticipated and the angle is increased until a slip 
occurs. The tangent of the angle is the COF marked on the 
tester. The standard test method for the BM II was 
proposed by the American Society of Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) [9]. According to the ASTM standard, 
it might be necessary to average the maximum COF that a 
non-slip occurs and the minimum COF that a slip occurs. 
  The COF values reported by the Mark II were 
compared with the horizontal-vertical force ratio (FH/FV) 
obtained from a force platform [10][11]. The results 
showed that the COF obtained directly from the Mark II 
and from the force plate measurements showed good 
agreement over a range of floor surfaces and 
contaminants for both non-slip and barely slip conditions. 
The Mark II was also shown to have a good correlation 
(r>0.954) with the dynamic friction coefficient measured 
with a dynamic apparatus designed to simulate a slip [10]. 
Comparisons between the results obtained with the BM II 
and other friction measurement devices were reported by 
[10][11][12][13]. Comparisons between the readings of 
the Mark II and subjective ratings of floor slipperiness 
have been reported by Chang et al. [14] and Li et al. [15].

the footwear sample under floor and surface conditions. It 
was apparent that the velocities of slipping on wet 
surfaces were significantly higher than those of the dry 
surfaces. On wet surfaces, ceramic and steel had 
significant (p<0.05) higher velocity than those of the 
plastic and terrazzo floors. The difference between 
ceramic and steel floors was not significant. Neither was 
the difference between plastic and terrazzo floors 
significant. The velocity on wet floor was approximately 
in the range of 60 to 69 cm/sec. On dry surfaces, there 
was no significant difference between any of the two 
floors tested. The velocity was approximately in the range 
of 38 to 42 cm/sec.  
Fig. 3 shows the time of slipping of the footwear 
during the measurement. On dry surfaces, the time were 
significantly (p<0.0001) higher than those of the wet 
surfaces for all four floors. For dry surfaces, the time of 
slipping ranged from 112 to 125 ms. For wet surfaces, the 
time of slipping ranged from 70 to 80 ms.  
The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the COF 
and the time and velocity of slipping was 0.76 (p<0.0001) 
and -0.81 (p<0.0001), respectively. This implies that high 
slipping velocity or short slipping time was associated 
with low COF value. This was consistent with the results 
in the ANOVA.

    A simple linear regression model was established to 
describe the relationship between the COF and the 
slipping velocity of footwear sample using the following 
equation: 
 
   COF = β0 +β1× velocity  
 
where β0 and  β1 are regression coefficients. The estimated 
parameters for β0 and β1 were 0.719 and -0.009, 
respectively. The two-tailed t-test for the two regression 
coefficients were both significant at p<0.0001. The 
coefficient of determination, or R2, of the model was 0.66 
indicating that 66% of the variation of COF readings may 
be explained the slipping velocity of the footwear sample.  
   
IV.  DISCUSSION 
 
 Operation of the BM II requires repetitive strikes of 
the footwear on the floor. The operator needs to judge 
whether a slip or a non-slip occurs. Such a judgment is 
more or less subjective. A photocell activated timer was 
fabricated to be used with the BM II slipmeter to measure 
the time of slip for the footwear sample when measuring 
the COF. This timer was deigned as an aid to the operator 
in judging the “fast slip” more reliably. One of the 
hypotheses of the study was that the slipping velocity of 
the footwear sample was not COF-dependent. In other 
words, a constant slipping velocity exists for all footwear, 
floor, and surface conditions at the minimum COF where 
a slip did occur. This hypothesis was, however, rejected. 
The results of the study indicated that the time of slipping, 
or alternatively the slipping velocity, was COF-dependent. 
The difference between dry and wet surfaces was 
significant. This implied that a constant velocity for 
slip/non-slip judgment does not exist. Even so, the range 
of the slipping time for those of the dry and wet surfaces 
still provides hints for an novice operator in making a 
slip/non-slip judgement. 
 
 
V.  CONCLUSION 
 
 In this research, a photocell activated switch timer 
was used together with the BM II slipmeter in friction 
measurement. The slipping time and velocity of footwear
