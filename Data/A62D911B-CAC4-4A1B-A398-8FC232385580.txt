Abstract
The next generation wireless networks will integrate several application scenarios and provide a wide spectrum
of services. To accommodate this and maintain seamless wireless access, the user devices will become smarter
than ever and capable of sensing the surrounding environment and seizing available wireless resource whenever
needed. In this project, we investigate distributed coding for such dynamic wireless networks. The goal is to provide
space diversity through user cooperation without the need of multiple antennas. In the first year of this project, we
considered the design of cognitive radio (CR) with partial channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We
replaced the dirty paper coding (DPC) used in the cognitive radio with full CSIT by the linear assignment Gel’fand-
Pinsker coding (LA-GPC), which can utilize the limited knowledge of the channel more efficiently. Based on the
achievable rate derived from the LA-GPC, two optimization problems under the fast and slow fading channels
were formulated. We derived semi-analytical solutions to find the relaying ratios and precoding coefficients. These
solutions can be efficiently computed, and make practical applications of CR with partial CSIT possible. Moreover,
a new coding scheme is proposed to implement the LA-GPC in practice. Simulation results show that the proposed
semi-analytical solutions perform close to the optimal solutions found by brute-force search, and outperform the
systems based on naive DPC. It is also shown that the proposed practical coding scheme can efficiently reach the
theoretical rate performance.

3Due to limited feedback bandwidth and the delay caused by channel estimation, it is more practical to
consider the case with only partial knowledge of CSIT. Unfortunately, the interference-free rate achieved
by DPC heavily relies on perfectly known CSIT. It has been observed that naively applying DPC in
fading channels with partial CSIT may cause a significant performance loss [10], [11]. The authors of
[10] and [11]–[13] also provided suboptimal designs for the scalar and vector fading dirty-paper channels,
respectively. In this report, we focus on the CR system design with one type of partial CSIT as [11],
where only the fading channel statistics are available at both the primary and CR transmitters. The main
contributions of this report are as following. We use a coding scheme more general than the DPC, termed
the linear-assignment Gel’fand-Pinsker coding (LA-GPC) [14] to derive the achievable rate of the CR
channel. Based on the achievable rate, we then propose design methods to optimize the performance of the
CR system with only the statistics of CSIT for both fast and slow fading scenarios [15]. The goal is to keep
the primary user’s rate unchanged while maximizing the CR user’s rate. The considered problems are non-
convex and almost analytically intractable. Therefore, we provide semi-analytical solutions to the optimal
relaying ratio of the CR transmitter for both fast and slow fading channels. These solutions are obtained
by deriving the moments of ratio of quadratic form and the deterministic approximations of probability
inequalities [16]. To optimize the CR user’s own rate, we also provide semi-analytical solutions to the
precoding coefficients for both fast and slow fading channels. When the K-factor of the Rician fading
channel [15] approaches infinity, asymptotic analysis shows that these sub-optimal solutions converge
to the full CSIT solution. Simulation results show that the proposed semi-analytical methods perform
well compared to the optimal solutions found by brute-force search under various channel conditions. In
addition to the theoretical results which are based on unstructured random Gaussian codebooks, we also
use nested-lattice codebooks with lattice decoding to implement the precoding in practice. Simulation
results show that the nested-lattice coding scheme can efficiently approach the theoretical achievable rate.
II. BACKGROUND AND SYSTEM MODEL
In this section we first introduce the system model in consideration. We then review the problems of
DPC and LA-GPC in fading channels. After that we will derive the rate formula of the fading cognitive
channel with LA-GPC.∗
A. The fading cognitive channel
The cognitive channel coined by [7] is shown in Fig. 1. The channel gains between primary transmitter
and receiver, primary transmitter and CR receiver, CR transmitter and primary receiver, and CR transmitter
and receiver are denoted by H11, H21, H12, and H22, respectively. The signals transmitted by primary and
CR are Xp and Xc with transmit power constraints Pp and Pc, respectively. The unidirectional arrow from
the primary transmitter to the CR transmitter means that the CR transmitter unilaterally knows the primary
user’s codewords non-causally. The feasibility of this assumption is discussed in [9]. The signals at the
primary and CR receivers are[

where Xˆc is the CR user’s own signal after being precoded. The CR transmitter relays the primary user’s
signal to maintain the performance of the primary link. The relaying ratio α1 is the percentage of CR’s

5and interference, respectively, are known perfectly at the receiver, but only their statistics are known at
transmitter. For illustration purpose, we first focus on the fast fading channel in this subsection. The
capacity of this channel can be modified from [14] as
sup
f (u|s), f (·)
E{R(Hx = hx, Hs = hs)}, (5)
where
R(Hx, Hs) = I(U ;Y |Hx,Hs)− I(U ;S), (6)
U is an auxiliary random variable with distribution obtained via the conditional distribution f (u|s), and
f (·) is a deterministic function such that X = f (U,S). We select f (U,S) =U−α2S which makes
U = X +α2S. (7)
Such selection of the strategy function is called the linear assignment strategy and α2 is the precoding
coefficient. With perfect CSIT, we can set side information S = HsXp and choose α2 according to the
linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) filter coefficient αc ,H∗x Px/(|Hx|2Px+1) to estimate X from
the interference-free channel Y = HxX +Z, and the interference-free rate is achievable. Costa named the
LA-GPC with α2 = αcHs as the DPC [8]. However, in our setting, the selection of α2 must rely only on
the channel statistics. Thus the MMSE filter used in Costa’s DPC cannot be used here.
C. Achievable rate of CR with LA-GPC
Before further discussing the primary and CR users’ performances in fast and slow fading channels,
the rate functions with given channel gains should be derived first. Assuming that the linear-assignment
strategy is used, we have U = Xˆc +α2Xp from (4) and (7). The CR user’s achievable rate with given
channel realizations can be computed as [17]
R(h22,h21), I(U ;Ys|H22 = h22,H21 = h21)− I(U ;S)

 . (9)
Similarly, when the CR user is active, the primary user’s achievable rate with given channel realizations
can be computed as
R(h11,h12), I(Xp;Yp|H11 = h11,H12 = h12)
= log

. (10)
Without loss of generality, in the following we let both σ2Zp and σ
2
Zs be 1. For the convenience of derivation,
we further arrange R(h22,h21) and R(h11,h12), and replace h22, h21, h11, h12 with H22, H21, H11, H12,
respectively, to make both rates channel dependent random variables:
R(H11, H12) = log

7can solve α1 from (14) with equality first. As shown in the proof of Theorem 1, with carefully chosen
Taylor series expansion of E[R(H11, H12)], we can guarantee the feasibility of α1. With the derived α1
we can then solve (13) with the knowledge of moments of the ratio of quadratic forms [18] [19]. The
above description are summarized as the following.
Theorem 1: Given primary user’s target rate RPergodic, together with the mean µ1 and covariance matrix
Σ1 of the vector channel to the primary receiver as given in Table I, the relaying ratio α1 for the fast
fading CR channel can be found sub-optimally by solving

channel can be approximated by
α2 =

(1−α1)Pc+1 . (16)
Note that (15) is a transcendental function of α1 which can not be solved analytically. Thus we resort
to solving α1 numerically.
B. Slow fading scenario
For the quasi-static slow fading channels, the decoding error probability cannot be arbitrarily small
since the transmitter does not know the reliable transmission rate with the limited channel knowledge.
In this channel, the outage probability [15] for a certain target rate is more suitable than the Shannon
capacity to measure the performance.
For the CR user with a target rate RCR, the outage probability defined as P(R(H21,H22)< RCR) should
be minimized. Let PPout and R
P be the primary user’s achievable outage probability and outage capacity,
respectively, in the absence of the CR transmitter. Since the CR system must ensure that the primary
user’s outage probability does not increase, we have the following constrained minimization problem for
the outage probability of the CR user
minimize PCRout
subject to P(R(H21,H22)< RCR)≤ PCRout (17)
P(R(H11,H12)< RP)≤ PPout . (18)
Assume that the CR transmitter knows the primary user’s target outage probability Ppout and target rate
RP. The feasibility of this assumption is discussed in Section II. As in the ergodic case, α1 and α2
can be solved from (18) and (17) sequentially. To reformulate the complex outage constraint (18) into
an analytically solvable one, we resort to the concept of deterministic approximations of probability
inequalities [16]. In [17] it was observed that if the mean of the rate is maximized, the deviation of the
rate will also be increased, which may result in a worse outage capacity. As a result, if we want to achieve
the outage probability constraint efficiently, we need to consider both the mean and deviation of the rate
simultaneously. In addition, to take the tightness of the approximation into consideration, we adopt the
modified Cantelli’s inequality [20]. The results are summarized as Theorem 2 with the proof in Appendix
C.
9C. Asymptotic behaviors of the proposed sub-optimal coefficients
When the K-factor is high, knowing the mean of the channels is almost the same as knowing the
channel gains perfectly. We will show that when the K-factor increases, the proposed sub-optimal system
parameters converge to optimal values computed with full CSIT in slow fading channels, as those in [9].
This verifies the asymptotic correctness of the proposed sub-optimal methods. The results are summarized
as the following. The proofs are provided in Appendix F and G, respectively.
Corollary 2: When the K-factor approaches infinity, the proposed sub-optimal relaying ratios α1 under
fast and slow fading both converge to the optimal α1 of the perfect CSIT case.
Corollary 3: When the K-factor approaches infinity, the proposed sub-optimal precoding coefficients
α2 under fast and slow fading both converge to the optimal α2 of the perfect CSIT case.
IV. PRACTICAL LATTICE-BASED LINEAR-ASSIGNMENT GEL’FAND-PINSKER CODING
All the previous results are based on the LA-GPC with Shannon’s unstructured Gaussian random
codebooks. In the following we introduce a practical lattice-based coding to implement the LA-GPC for
the CR user. With the carefully designed filters specified in Theorem 4, the proposed lattice-based LA-
GPC is a non-trivial extension of the well known lattice-based DPC [21]. The differences between the
proposed lattice-based LA-GPC and the lattice-based DPC are outlined as follows. First, the precoding
filter here is selected according to the proposed precoding coefficient α2 in Section III, which is better
than naively using the MMSE filter αc described after (7) for the interference-free channel as in [21].
Secondly, with only the statistics of the CSIT, the receiver filter selection is more involved than simply
choosing it as αc in DPC [21] [22]. Specifically, this filter must be different from the precoding filter
to maximize the achievable rate of lattice coding, and this is contrary to the common practice in the
lattice-based DPC [21] [22]. Finally, we adopt the finite dimensional self-similar lattices to implement
the lattice coding. Our construction is much more feasible than [21] which uses a lattice code with very
long length. The proposed coding works very well with a reasonable codeword length (and therefore the
decoding latency), and our simulation in Section V-C verifies this.
A. Signal model for lattice-based LA-GPC
To illustrate the lattice-based LA-GPC, we focus on the following channel corresponding to (3) with
discrete time index t as
Y (t) = Hx(t)XL(t)+Hs(t)S(t)+Z(t), (25)
where 1 ≤ t ≤ T , T is the codeword length. To emphasize the difference between lattice coding and
random Gaussian codebooks used in the previous sections, we use XL(t) instead of X(t) to represent the
lattice-coded signal. As in Section II-C, we first focus on the rate (8) which comes from (6) with given
channel realizations Hx(t) = hx(t) and Hs(t) = hs(t). We also rewrite (25) in an equivalent real super
channel to present the lattice coding more easily. By concatenating all T symbols, the channel becomes
Y = HxXL+HsS+Z, (26)
where XL =(XTL,1, . . . ,X
T
L,T)
T and XL,t =(Re{XL(t)}, Im{XL(t)})T. The non-causally known side-information
vector at the transmitter S and the noise vector Z are obtained similarly from S(t) and Z(t), respectively,
as XL from XL(t). The covariance matrices of S and Z are denoted by Σs and Σz, respectively. The 2T×2T
block-diagonal real channel matrix Hx is diag([Hx1 · · ·HxT ]), where the tth diagonal term is
Hxt =
[
Re{hx(t)} −Im{hx(t)}
Im{hx(t)} Re{hx(t)}
]
,
and Hs is formed from Hs(t) in the same way as Hx from Hx(t). The channel input power constraint
is (1−α1)Pc/2 because the CR user transmits its own signal with power Pc/2 per real dimension, and
relays the primary user’s signal with power α1Pc/2.
11
Then we can use the generalized minimum Euclidean distance lattice decoder to decode cc. First the
decoder finds
bˆ = arg min
b∈Z2T
|Yˆ −LGcb|2, (36)
where Gc is the generator matrix of the channel coding lattice Λc. After that the decoded codeword is
cˆc = [Gcbˆ] mod Λq.
By using “good nested lattices” defined in [22] instead of the random Gaussian codebook in Section
III, the proposed lattice coding can also achieve the same outage capacity. The results are summarized as
follows.
Theorem 4: Select the precoding filter Fs, receiver filter Fr, and whitening filter L as (29), (33), and
(34), respectively. Based on sequences of good nested lattices, the coding specified in (28)-(36) with (4)
is able to achieve the linear-assignment rate R(h22,h21) = 1T log |ΣE |−1 under power constraint (1−α1)Pc
when T → ∞, where ΣE is defined in (35).
The details of the proof can be found in [24]. Here we provide the basic idea of the proof. As [21],
dither makes the transmitted signal XL and the noise e Gaussian. After whitening the noise e by L, the
equivalent channel becomes an AWGN channel. And from [21], [24] we know that the nested-lattice codes
achieve the capacity of this equivalent AWGN channel, which is the same as that of the corresponding
MMSE backward channel, 1T log |ΣE |−1, for large enough T . And the precoding filter Fs and the receiver
filter Fr are designed such that the capacity of this equivalent channel equals to the linear-assignment rate
R(h22,h21). Then the proposed coding achieves R(h22,h21).
For the fast fading channels, it is easy to modify the proposed coding methods to achieve the ergodic
capacities according to [23]. Note that with full CSIT, the proposed coding reduces to the conventional
DPC in [21] [22], that is, the Fs filter can be chosen according to αc in Section II-B and Fr reduces to
FsHx−1. A trivial implementation is to apply the conventional DPC naively in fast fading channels by
assuming that the channels always take values at their means. The naive DPC scheme chooses the filter
Fs naively according to αc but replacing random channels with their means, and all other filters remain
the same as those in the conventional DPC. The achievable rate 1T log |ΣE |−1 can be computed from the
corresponding ΣE with these selected filters. However, according to our simulations in Section V-A, this
naive DPC suffers severely when it is applied to channels without perfect CSIT.
We will use the filters specified in Theorem 4 to design practical codes for our simulations. When the
decoding latency requirement is loose and codelength can be very long, we can combine the proposed
filters with the code design methods in [24], [25] to achieve the theoretical results in Section III. The more
challenging task is to design good codes with reasonable codeword length. Conventional Construction-A
lattice codes [25] may not work well at short and moderate code length. On the other hand, it is well
known that in many cases, the best lattices in terms of channel coding gain (densest packing) are also
good quantizers under moderate dimensions [26, Chapter 3]. This motivates us to use a pair of self-
similar nested lattices with coarse lattice Λq generated by Λq = QΛc, where the coding rate is given by
R = 2logQ. For example, we can choose the fine lattice Λc as the Gosset lattice E8 [26] which has the
densest packing in dimension eight. Then the coarse lattice and the overall nested-lattice are also good.
A Fano sequential-decoding based lattice decoder [27] is used to solve (36) efficiently. Our simulation in
Section V-C shows that the performance of this construction is much better than that of the Construction-A
lattice based LA-GPC presented in [28].
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section we demonstrate the performance of the proposed LA-GPC based CR system under
both fast and slow fading channels. We also show the performance of the proposed practical lattice
encoder/decoder which implements the LA-GPC. For simplicity, the four channels in Fig. 1 are assumed
to be independent Rician with the same K-factor, and the noise variances are set to unity. We use the K-
factor as the performance index for comparison. For conciseness of the presentation, the explicit complex

ratios and the precoding coefficients for both fast and slow fading channels. Asymptotic analysis showed
that the relaying ratios and the precoding coefficients obtained by the proposed methods converge to those
with full CSIT when the K-factor approaches infinity. We also used nested-lattice coding and decoding to
realize the precoding in practice. Simulation results showed that the proposed semi-analytical parameter
design methods perform well compared to the exhaustive search. Simulation results also showed that the
nested-lattice coding scheme can effectively reach the achievable rate of the CR channel with partial CSIT
at high SNR.
This progress matches what we had specified in the proposal for the first year of the project.
APPENDIX
A. Proof of Theorem 1
By taking expectation of (11) with respect to the channel distributions we have
E[R(H11,H12)] = E[log(1+HHp SH p)]−E[log(1+HHp QH p)]
, E[log(1+ ε1)]−E[log(1+ ε2)], (37)
where S , P+Q, ε1 , HHp SH p, and ε2 , HHp QH p. To guarantee that (14) is valid, we expand f (ε1) ,
log(1+ ε1) and g(ε2), log(1+ ε2) by the Taylor series with different orders, respectively. The reason is
as the following. We first expand log(1+ ε1) by the k-th order Taylor series with respect to the mean of
ε1, µε1 , as
log(1+ ε1) = log(1+µε1)− logeΣkn=2
(−1)n
n
(ε1−µε1)n
(1+µε1)n
+o1 , fk(ε1)+o1, (38)
where fk(ε1) is the truncated k-th order Taylor expansion and o1 is the Lagrange remainder. After applying
the expectation operator to (38) and truncating the remainder o1 we have
E[ fk] = log(1+µε1)− logeΣkn=2
(−1)n
n
E[(ε1−µε1)n]
(1+µε1)n
, (39)
where E[ fk(ε1)] is further simplified as E[ fk]. Since the Taylor expansion of the logarithmic function
f is an alternating series, and E[(ε1−µε1)n+1]> 0, ∀n ∈N, from [19], we have the following relations:
E[ f1]> E[ f3]> E[ f5]> · · ·> E[ f ] and E[ f2]< E[ f4]< E[ f6]< · · ·< E[ f ]. Similar properties can be found
for g(ε2). The truncated first order Taylor expansion of E[log(1+ ε2)] can be derived in the same way.
From the above we know that E[ f ]−E[g]> E[ f2i]−E[g2 j−1]. Thus solving the following equality

makes the constraint (14) valid where i, j ∈ N. Here we choose i = j = 1 for simplicity. After some
manipulations we have (15). The mean µε1(α1) and variance σ2ε1(α1) of ε1 can be found from [19], and
the mean µε2 of ε2 is (1−α1)Pc.
B. Proof of Proposition 1
Let B(α2) , HHc (c0(P+Q)−D)Hc + c0, which is a convex function of α2. With the fact that the
logarithm is concave, R(H22, H21) is concave with respect to α2. Therefore, from [30, p.209] we know
that (13) is concave. Thus, we can set the derivative of E[R(H22, H21)] with respect to the complex
conjugate of α2 to zero to find the extreme value as
∂E[R(H21, H22)]
∂α∗2

= 0, (40)
where fHc is the probability density function of Hc, and the validity of the interchange of the integration
and differentiation of the second equality is obvious. Note that solving the general moment of quadratic

D. Proof of Theorem 3
First, substituting (12) into (17), and after some manipulations we have the following optimization
problem
αo2 = argminα2
P(z, HHc EHc = HH2 E2H2 < c0d−1), (45)
where E2 = Σ
1/2
2 EΣ
1/2
2 , and H2 ∼ CN (Σ−1/22 µ2,I2). The transformation from E to E2 is to make H2 have
an identity covariance matrix for the convenience of the following analysis. After substituting the eigen
decomposition E2 = vHΛv into z, we have
z = HH3 ΛH3 ∼ λ1χ2
(
2,2|µ31|2
)
+λ2χ2
(
2,2|µ32|2
)
,
where H3∼ CN (µ3,I2), µ3 = [µ31, µ32]T , vΣ−1/22 µ2, and λ1 and λ2 are the eigenvalues of E2. The notation
χ2(p,q) denotes the noncentral chi-square distribution with degree of freedom p and non-centrality q. Note
that the objective function (45) is a function of α2. That is, λ1, λ2, µ31, and µ32 are controlled by α2.
To calculate the outage probability (45), we resort to approximating z by a scaled single central chi-
square random variable [33] as
z∼ λ1χ2
(
2,2|µ31|2
)
+λ2χ2
(
2,2|µ32|2
)' vχ2(w). (46)
Recall that the chi-square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution. Thus w does not have
to be an integer. The parameters v and w should be chosen such that both sides of (46) have the same
first and second moments [33] as
vw = λ1
(
1+ |µ31|2
)
+λ2
(
1+ |µ32|2
)
, (47)
2v2w = λ21
(
1+2|µ31|2
)
+λ22
(
1+2|µ32|2
)
.
With the fact that
λ1+λ2 = tr(E2) = tr(Σ2E), (48)
λ1|µ31|2+λ2|µ32|2 = µH3 Λµ3 = µH2 Σ

we can find the value of vw. Similarly, from

we can find the value of 2v2w. Then v and w can be expressed as (22). After that, solving (45) with (46)
is equivalent to finding
αo2 = argminα2
∫ c0d−12v(α2)

which can be further represented as (21).
E. Proof of Corollary 1
From [34] we know that the incomplete gamma function can be bounded as following
(1− e−sx)a < γ(a,x)
Γ(a)
, where s =
{
1, 0 < a < 1
Γ(1+a)

a , a > 1.
Let a = w(α2)2 and x =
c0d−1
2v(α2)
, we then have (23).
