Abstract 
With the rapid advances in mobile 
communication technologies, QR code [1][4] 
in the embedded camera devices has been 
used as new input interfaces. However, the 
previous works for extracting QR code from 
an image do not consider a non-uniform 
background. In this paper, we implement the 
applications of QR code and propose an 
efficient algorithm to extract QR code from 
the non-uniform background. In contrast 
with prior works, our approach is of higher 
accuracy for QR-code recognition and more 
practical for use in a mobile information 
environment. 
Keywords: image processing, QR-code 
extraction, QR-code recognition, 
non-uniform background, mobile phone. 
二、 研究結果概要 
    QR code has been used in various 
applications since the QR code has the large 
capacity, the small printout size, the high 
speed scan, the damage resistance and the 
data robustness [5]. There are many 
advantages to use the QR code in mobile 
phones such as omni-direction readability 
and error correction capability. Therefore, 
mobile phones adopt the QR code to support 
many services such as booking tickets, 
paying a fee and URL reading [1][2][3][9]. 
    The conventional approaches 
[5][6][7][8] are to extract a barcode from the 
image of a uniform and even background. 
However, in the real circumstance, the light 
condition of the image taken from the 
camera phone is uneven, and the 
background of the image is non-uniform. 
Therefore, the traditional schemes suffer 
from accurate issues in the real

The flexible extraction scheme enables the 
camera phone to receive more services. 
Furthermore, our mechanism requires no 
modification on the current camera-phone 
hardware architecture. Fig. 2 presents the 
steps of the procedure of QRE. Roughly, 
QRE can be divided into three main phases: 
adaptive light balancing, QR-code capturing, 
and QR-code rectification. 
    1. Adaptive light balancing  
    In the real circumstance, we take a 
picture under the uneven light conditions. 
Therefore, the QR code is distorted by the 
uneven light condition such that it is 
difficult to decide the threshold of a 
black-white boundary from the histogram of 
an image. Therefore, we use the adaptive 
light-balancing technique [11] improve the 
quality of the image as shown in Fig. 3.

    2. QR-code capturing 
    By obtaining the quality-improved 
image, we can transform the gray-level 
image into the binary image. Furthermore, 
we adopt page segmentation procedure in 
order to reduce the non-uniform background 
to several blocks. Then, we get edge 
representation of every block. In addition, 
we use finder patterns of the QR code and 
Intersection-based Corner Detection (IDC) 
to find the QR-code position as shown in 
Fig. 4.

    3. QR-code rectification 
    Finally, we perform perspective 
transformation function [10] to rectify the 
shape for the QR code as shown in Fig. 5. 
According the version of the QR code, QRE 
constructs its size through resampling 
procedure.
