molding), but its poor electric conductivity and mechanical strength handicap the 
scale-up of fuel cell stack [13]. As the most promising substitute, metallic plate shows 
properties essential to bipolar plate except chemical stability. Strong acidic environment 
in PEMFC stemming from perfluorosulfonic acid membrane dissociates metal ions, e.g. 
Fe, Cr and Ni ions, from metallic bipolar plate to contaminate polymer electrolyte and 
Pt catalyst. The declines in proton conductivity and catalyst activity eventuate in the 
collapse of PEMFC performance [14]. Special alloys as well as surface modification, 
therefore, have been investigated intensively for improving the anti-corrosivity of 
metallic bipolar plate [15-16]. 
A new approach is coating a carbon film on stainless steel substrate by thermal 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which may integrate the advantages of graphite into 
metallic bipolar plate. According to literature data [17], the major forms of carbon 
deposits are tubular or filamentous rather than a compact film. Hence, in this study a 
process to develop continuous carbon film on AISI 304 stainless steel (abbreviated as 
304SS below) is investigated. We found that surface morphologies of the films are 
strongly dependent on the concentration of carbonaceous gas in the CVD process. The 
obtained samples were subjected to corrosion test and PEMFC performance analysis to 
compare with commercial graphite plate. 
 
 
Experimental 
 
Preparation and characterization of carbon film 
As the catalyst in catalytic graphitization [18], 1µm-thick nickel was applied to 
304SS substrates by magnetron sputtering. Later on, these samples were placed in a 
tube furnace to develop carbon film at 680oC under acetylene/hydrogen mixed gas 
atmospheres of three flow-rate ratios, 0.15, 0.45 and 1.5, which supplied carbon sources 
for the CVD process. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the 
morphology of the carbon deposits. In some cases, energy dispersion spectrometer 
(EDS) was performed with SEM. Glow discharge spectrometer (GDS) and dispersive 
Raman spectrometer were employed to determine the composition-depth profile and 
carbon structure of the carbon film.

ordered graphite film provides the interspaces between (002) graphite basal planes as 
channels for the migration of Ni atoms from Ni underlayer to the surface of graphite 
film, where Ni atoms coalesce to small particles and catalyze the subsequently coming 
carbon molecules to form filamentous carbon. A sketch describing the mechanism is 
shown in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c) indicate that carbon balls displace filamentous carbon as 
composed unit of the coatings while C2H2/H2 ratio is increased to 0.45 or even 1.5. We 
thus assume that the increase in carbon source concentration is accompanied with the 
development of carbon balls. It seems that C2H2/H2 mixed gas ratio of 0.45 provides an 
ideal carbon source in which carbon balls stack densely to form continuous and compact 
film on the substrate, showing mirror-like smoothness. By contrast, a loose coating 
composed of carbon balls is observed on the specimen prepared at C2H2/H2 mixed gas 
ratio of 1.5. Owing to this uneven stacking of carbon balls, it is believed that carbon 
balls congregate to form clusters in advance of depositing on specimen surface. This 
phenomenon might arise from the extremely high-concentration carbon source bringing 
a large number of carbon balls which collide with each other at high probability in the 
boundary layer and form the stable structure of carbon-ball cluster due to the decrease in 
surface free energy. 
 
Characterizations of the carbon film 
Since the specimen prepared under C2H2/H2 mixed gas ratio of 0.45 exhibits 
significantly different surface morphology from filamentous carbon, it is interesting to 
investigate the carbon film in terms of structure and growth mechanism. SEM image of 
the carbon/Ni interface shown in Fig. 3 displays a tightly compact structure existing in 
the carbon film. It is worth to note that there are three bright regions larger than 250 nm 
inside the carbon film, identified as Ni precipitates by EDS analyses. These precipitates 
appear at similar distances from the carbon/Ni interface. The composition-depth profile 
shown in Fig. 4 demonstrates the concentration of Ni gradually decreasing from the 
carbon/Ni interface toward the specimen surface, but there is an abrupt rise at about the 
middle of the carbon film. This unusual phenomenon precisely corresponds to the 
appearance of Ni precipitates in the carbon film as described in Fig. 3. 
On the basis of the above results, a probable growth mechanism to the carbon 
film is diagrammed in Fig. 5 and detailed as follows: at the outset of the CVD process, 
carbon balls are transformed to a highly ordered graphite layer at the carbon/Ni 
interface through the catalysis of Ni underlayer. This graphite layer provides some

plate under PEMFC operating environment, i.e. the corrosion of 304SS bipolar plate is 
spontaneous. 
After the corrosion endurance tests, concentrations of metal ions in the H2SO4 test 
solutions were gauged by ICP-MS, the results are consistent with the Tafel data 
obtained in Fig. 7. A considerable amount of metal ions (Fe: 8.175 ppm; Cr: 1.584 ppm; 
Ni: 1.725 ppm) were detected in the H2SO4 test solution of 304SS plate, suggesting that 
304SS should corrode under PEMFC operating environment and liberate metal ions to 
contaminate the polymer electrolyte and Pt catalysts in PEMFC. Unlike 304SS plate, no 
metal ions were detected in the H2SO4 test solution of CFCSS plate, proving H2SO4 
solution unable to penetrate through the carbon film to corrode 304SS substrate beneath. 
It is thus believed that the peak at 1.6 V is not related to the redox of CFCSS, but to the 
redox of H2O on CFCSS surface, which is identical to the electrochemical reactions 
occurring on the surface of Poco graphite plate. The amazing result indeed demonstrates 
that the chemical stability of 304SS plate can be improved to the level of high-purity 
graphite plate by utilizing our CVD process to apply a carbon film on 304SS plate. 
 
Influence of bipolar plates on the performance of fuel cells 
When PEMFC operation is performed at high temperature (above 60oC), some 
problems, e.g. reactant gas humidifying, water flooding and product water-removing, 
arise and affect PEMFC performance seriously. To precisely evaluate the influence of 
anti-corrosivity of different bipolar plates on PEMFC performance, operating 
temperature of 40oC was used to avoid the above effects and eliminate the variation of 
ambient temperature in the continuous 100-hour PEMFC operation. 
Fig. 8 shows the polarization curves of the fuel cell modules with different 
bipolar plates after 100-hour operation at 0.6 V and 40oC. The fuel cell with CFCSS 
bipolar plates demonstrates superior performance compared to that with 304SS bipolar 
plates. Although each fuel cell exhibited the same performance in the beginning, the 
current output of the fuel cell with 304SS bipolar plates gradually fell from 500 to 420 
mA within 100 hours, i.e. 16% loss in performance. According to the results observed 
in the corrosion endurance tests, it is supposed that 304SS bipolar plates liberate metal 
ions to contaminate Pt catalysts and proton-conductive membrane in the 100-hour 
PEMFC operation. The declines in Pt catalytic activity and proton conductivity are 
responsible for the counteraction of 304SS bipolar plates to the PEMFC performance. 
The fuel cell with CFCSS bipolar plates manifested excellent stability in performance as 
that with Poco graphite bipolar plates during the 100-hour operation. The similarity

water flooding and product water-removing. As consistent with the results observed in 
the corrosion tests, the fuel cell with CFCSS bipolar plates demonstrated excellent 
stability in performance as compared to that with 304SS bipolar plates, which decayed 
16% in performance after the 100-hour running test at 0.6 V and 40oC. The fuel cell 
with CFCSS bipolar plates performs slightly better than that with Poco graphite bipolar 
plates in the ohmic polarization region (0.5-0.8 V), responding to the lower surface 
resistance of the carbon film. 
Overall, CFCSS bipolar plate displays excellent chemical stability in low 
temperature-operating PEMFC. To confirm the performance of CFCSS bipolar plate in 
high temperature-operating PEMFC, further tests with the help of ideal gas flow pattern 
which efficiently improves water management at high temperature are necessary.

stability. Proton-conductive membrane composed of perfluorinated sulfonic acid 
polymer serves as electrolyte in PEMFC, yielding a strong acidic environment for 
metallic bipolar plates. Metal ions derived from corrosion of metallic bipolar plate 
contaminate polymer electrolyte and catalysts, decreasing in proton conductivity and 
catalyses. Hence, corrosion-resistant metallic plates with special alloy composition 
[14] or surface modification, such as TiN coating, were assessed. Cho et al. [15] 
pointed out that performance of PEMFC with TiN-coated 316 stainless steel bipolar 
plates degrades significantly in 300 hours, which implies serious effect of metal ions 
contamination on PEMFC performance even though corrosion of metal plate is slight. 
To combine advantages of graphite and metal, Sone et al. [16] grew a layer of 
carbon on AISI 304 stainless steel (or 304SS) substrate by chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) process. Still, the coating could not protect 304SS substrate against corrosion 
as the major form of deposited carbon was tubular in shape. In our work, a continuous 
carbon film was applied on 304SS, and growth mechanism and structure of the film 
have been investigated. Corrosion test and PEMFC performance analysis of the 
carbon-film coated 304 stainless steel (CFCSS) were operated in comparison with 
those of commercial graphite (Poco AXF-5QCF). Based on the results, we expect 
CFCSS as a suitable material for PEMFC bipolar plates. 
 
2. Experimental 
Nickel (Ni) 1 µm thick was applied to commercial 304SS plate (20 mm × 20 
mm × 1 mm) by magnetron sputtering, and then placed in a tube furnace to develop 
carbon film at 680oC by CVD process. C2H2/H2 mixed gas serves as carbonaceous 
source and the concentration was gauged by flow-rate ratio of C2H2 to H2. Film 
microstructure was observed with field-emission scanning electron microscope 
(FESEM), and energy dispersion spectrometer (EDS) attached to the FESEM 
employed to analyze chemical composition. Composition-depth profile and carbon 
structure of the film were determined with glow discharge spectrometer (GDS) and 
dispersive Raman spectrometer, respectively. 
Corrosion endurance tests were carried out by potentiodynamic polarization in 
0.5 M H2SO4 solution at room temperature to simulate corrosive PEMFC environment 
[17, 18]. Sample was exposed to 0.5 M H2SO4 solution by a reactive area of 1 cm2 
and operated as working electrode. Saturated Ag/AgCl (3.5 M in concentration) 
electrode and platinum net served as reference and auxiliary electrode, respectively. 
Scanning range of potentiostat (CHI 6081C) was from -1.0 V to 2.0 V at a scanning 
rate of 1 mVs-1. After corrosion test, metal ion concentration in H2SO4 solution was 
ascertained by induced couple plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS).  
Lastly, performance of single cell was analyzed by PEMFC testing system. 
 7
than 250 nm. It seems that Ni particles are isolated from Ni layer and distributed at 
the same distance to the interface between carbon film and Ni layer. 
Composition-depth profile of optimal CFCSS measured with glow discharge 
spectrometer (Fig. 7) manifests that intensity of Ni signal gradually decreases from Ni 
layer toward carbon film. But inside the carbon film, intensity of Ni signal increases 
immediately at certain depth, and then rapidly decreases toward sample surface. This 
phenomenon corresponds to the coalescence of Ni inside carbon film, as previously 
described in the cross-section image (Fig. 6). 
To explain the particular contexture of carbon film, a two-layer structure is 
proposed: when CFCSS are prepared under C2H2/H2 ratio of 0.45 at 680oC, some 
carbon molecules decomposed in initial state directly develop graphite film on sample 
surface by catalysis of Ni layer; others assemble to balls in boundary layer and then 
stack into a compact film on graphite film. The compact film not only hiders the 
contact between ensuing carbon molecules and Ni particles, which migrate from Ni 
layer to the surface of graphite film, to avoid developing carbon fibers, but also 
interrupts further diffusion of Ni atoms by its low-order graphite structure, which 
provides discontinuous channels for Ni atoms to migrate. A sketch explaining the 
mechanism is shown in Fig. 8. 
Raman spectrum of optimally prepared CFCSS appears in Fig. 9, further 
demonstrating a two-layer structure in the carbon film. Two characteristic peaks are 
featured: “G-mode” at 1580 cm-1 responds to vibration of carbon atoms in the 
in-plane stretching mode, denoting ordered graphite structure; “D-mode” at 1360 cm-1 
is designated as due to phonons at the M and K points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone 
that signifies defects in graphite structure [21, 22]. Inner layer of the structure consists 
of Ni-catalyzed graphite and its epitaxial layer, thus contributing most intensity of 
G-mode in Fig. 9, which shows narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) as a 
result of high-order graphite structure. In contrast, surface layer of the structure 
stacked by carbon balls, but working temperature of 680oC lends insufficient driving 
force for carbon balls to develop ordered graphite structure without catalysis of Ni. 
Surface layer therefore is composed of low-order graphite structure, contributing the 
signal of D-mode with wide FWHM in Fig. 9. 
To confirm the dense film affording enough protection for 304SS substrate, 
corrosion endurance tests were carried out via potentiodynamic polarization in 0.5 M 
H2SO4 solution at 25oC to simulate operating conditions in PEMFC. Figure 10 shows 
Tafel curves of 304SS, optimally prepared CFCSS, along with commercial graphite 
plate (Poco AXF-5QCF). Tafel curves of 304SS displays a reacting peak at -0.2 V, 
indicating oxidation of 304SS is predominate over its reduction above this potential. 
Main compositions of 304SS such as iron, chromium and nickel tend to dissociate 
 9
chemical stability of optimally prepared CFCSS superior to that of 304SS, nearly 
equal to high-purity graphite. CFCSS in our study has potential to replace commercial 
graphite as bipolar plate in PEMFC. Long term test (more than 1000 hours) for 
PEMFC assembled with CFCSS are in progress.
