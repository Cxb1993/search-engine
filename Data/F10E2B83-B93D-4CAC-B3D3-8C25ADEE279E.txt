Abstract: An bounce-back based immersed-
boundary lattice Boltzmann method was 
developed to cope with the moving boundary 
problem. A method to decompose the force 
into shear and normal force by momentum 
exchange in lattice Boltzmann method is 
provided. This algorithm performs as well as 
the accuracy of the theoretical analysis in 
stationary-boundary test, and the 
characteristics of the non-dimensional 
relaxation time τ is also discovered. In low 
Reynolds number flow, the results by the 
current method are comparable to the former 
experiments. 
  
Key words: lattice Boltzmann method, 
bounce-back based immersed-boundary, non-
dimensional relaxation time, low Reynolds 
number. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Fluid-structure interaction problem (FSI) has 
the wide diversity of application in 
engineering and nature, for example: aquatic 
animal locomotion which is just mentioned 
previously, fluttering or flapping wing for 
birds and insects, hovering rotor, turbo-fan, 
piston engine, propeller, blood flow in the 
cardiovascular system. 
    Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is an 
algorithm based on Boltzmann equation and 
lattice gas cellular automata (LGCA) [1]. 
Boltzmann equation depicts the phenomena 
of the fluid between macroscopic, which is 
governed by hydrodynamics, and 
microscopic, which is governed by 
molecular dynamics. LBM can be 
implemented and parallelized easily and 
contains physical intuition. The bounce-back 
rule in lattice Boltzmann method could well 
cover for the boundary condition by simply 
satisfying the principle of momentum 
conservation on the boundary [2,3].  
    Since LBM is still scanty of general 
manipulation for applying to arbitrary grid 
system, several strategies have been 
proposed to surmount the calculation for 
curved boundary in the last decades. 
Filippova and Hänel first brought up the idea 
to fit the curved boundary, which takes 
interpolation to bounce-back rule, and the 
idea to refine the local grid [4]. Mei, Luo, 
and Shyy improved the stability around the 
curved boundary on the base of the previous 
work [5]. Bouzidi et al. presented another 
simpler scheme without constructing the 
fictitious fluid point inside the body [6], and 
another extension based on Bouzidi et al.'s 
  3
applied. Otherwise if the forward and 
backward direction of streaming is the solid 
phase, then the collision operation is applied 
only.  After the above process, the following 
bounce-back operation on the wall is applied.

3. NUMERICAL TEST 
In this section, the accuracy of the IB-
LBM algorithm was studied at first, by two 
static boundary cases, that is formation of 
Couette flow and Stokes' second problem. 
To show the characteristic and the identity 
belong to the IB-LBM at low Reynolds 
number flow, the flow over a fixed circular 
cylinder at various range of Reynolds 
number is going through a serious validation 
including the drag coefficient in three 
distinct type flow, the symmetrical for Re<4, 
the transitional for 4<Re<40, and the 
unstable vortex-shading while Re is above 
40. The vortex length in the transitional flow 
and the shading frequency and lift nature in 
the unstable circumstance were studied 
along. Then on, the flow over a sphere in 
three-dimensional IB-LBM was also put 
through. 
 
 3.1. Formation of Couette Flow  
  The formation of the Couette flow between 
two parallel infinite plates is simulated here. 
The upper plate (y=H) is fixed, at time t=0, 
the lower plate (y=0) begins to move at 
uniform velocity U 0  instantaneously when 
the fluid is at rest as the initial condition.  
   This case is only a one-dimensional 
problem, which means all properties are 
function of y. We set the x-directional size in 
only three grid points and the y-directional 
with My+1 points. Left and right boundaries 
have periodic boundary condition. Top and 
bottom are the proposed bounce-back based 
immersed-boundary. There exists 
computational error between the numerical 
and exact solutions. Fig. 1 shows the 
standard (L2-norm) error in the various 
Reynolds number and grid resolution. It is 
obvious that the least deviation under fixed 
resolution My occurs almost in agreement 
with the line of  τ=1.1. The error versus Δx is 
submitted to order of 2 forτ=1.1.

various Reynolds number and grid resolution. 
 
 3.2 Flow above an oscillating infinite 
plate 
  The flow with an oscillating wall is often 
called the Stokes' second problem. Consider 
the oscillating wall, with )cos(),0,( 0 tUtxu  . 
Technically like the previous subsection, Fig. 
2 shows the standard error in various value 
of oscillating period and height resolution, 
My, but with constant Mach number. The 
best-solving τ in this case is about 1.2 . The 
order of accuracy approximates is about 3.4.

method10-14 is used. In the Paper 14, the accuracy and efficiency of the direct-forcing IB pressure 
correction method were presented. We also applied the Gauss theorem to derive the formulas for 
computing the hydrodynamic force and torque acting on a particle from the fluid by a volume 
integral instead of by a surface integral14. 
A discrete element method (DEM)15-18 is introduced to calculate the contact forces between solid bodies and 
between solids and walls. The DEM model is a spring and dashpot system to compute the collision force between two 
particles or particle and solid structure. However, the time step in DEM is generally smaller than that in a Navier-Stokes 
solver. Here, the DEM together with a multi-time-step algorithm is introduced into the proposed pressure correction 
method to simulate a granular flow impact on a tall structure. In this paper, the pressure correction method combines the 
direct-forcing IB method, the DEM, and the VOF method to simulate the fluid-solid interaction and to analysis the 
dynamic characteristics. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly describe the 
governing equations for the fluid-solid interaction flows. In Section 3 the numerical methods are introduced. In Section 
4, three physical problems, three-dimensional dam-break problem, three-dimensional wave impact on a tall structure, 
three-dimensional collapse of a submerged sphere stack impact on a tall structure, are performed to demonstrate 
efficiency and accuracy of the proposed pressure correction method. The final conclusions are stated in Section 5.  
II. Governing Equations 
When two immiscible incompressible viscous fluids move together, the two-fluid mixture can be treated as a 
single-phase medium by the VOF method that approximates the medium properties as 
)1(21   ,                                                                                  
(1a) 
     )1(21   .            
(1b) 
In these expressions, i and i  for i=1,2 are the densities and the viscosities of the individual constituents. A new 
medium property, ),( xt  , is introduced to describe the volume of fraction between the two fluids. With the assumption 
that the two fluids move in synchrony, the mixture motion may be described by the Navier-Stokes equations as 
0 u

In this expression,   indicates the whole computational domain and V  is the volume of a

contributions from the cells that intersect with the solid-fluid interface are calculated. 
 
3.3 Coupling algorithm 
The major challenge resides in choosing a proper time increment permitted in each scheme. In 
general, the characteristic time-step for a DEM calculation, tDEM, is assigned by considering a 
feasible contact time, such as Hertzian contact time, which is often much smaller than that allowed 
for a flow simulation, t, bounded by the scheme stability criterion. Adopting the same time 
increment inevitably degrades the efficiency of a Navier-Stokes equation solver. To overcome this 
degradation, a two-time-step algorithm is proposed as follows. The computations of the particle and 
the flow motions are integrated into a sequential simulations based on the flow time increment, 
t=ktDEM, that is k times longer than the DEM time step. Here, k is a given positive integer. 
Whenever a solid contact is detected, the computation is switched to a mode employing tDEM until 
contact ceases. During the in-contact computation on a finer time scale, the flow motion is assumed 
to be quasi-steady and thus not updated.  
Let nn u, and np be the density, velocity, and pressure of the flow and nSU , , 1, nS , nSX , , nSlsF ,

 , 
and nSlsT
, be the velocity, angular velocity, position, total force, and total torque of the spherical 
particle P  at time nt . The algorithm is presented as

4.2 Three-dimensional wave impact on a tall structure 
To further validate our method, the wave impact on a tall structure is tested. This is also a typical problem to see the 
capability of a numerical method for evaluating the wave impact force21-24. In this test, it is a three-dimensional 
dam-break with a wet bed confined within a rectangular box. The simulation set-up follows the experiment performed 
by Yeh and Petroff21. A box is 160 cm long, 61 cm wide, and 75 cm high with a 12 cm square column located 90 cm 
from on end of the tank. A volume of water contained behind the gate is 40 cm long, 61 cm wide, and 30 cm high and 
the initial depth of water on the wet bed is 1 cm. A schematic is shown in Fig. 3.  
 
Fig. 3. The schematic for three-dimensional wave impact on a tall structure. 
 
A stretched gird system in the z-direction shown is used. In the x-direction and y-direction, the uniform grid size 
x = y =1cm is used, and in the z-direction, the finest grid size is minz =0.5 cm. The gravity field is 2/81.9 sm . 
The density and the viscosity of water are wkg/m3, w=0.001 kg/m-s, and akg/m3,a=0.00001 kg/m-s for the 
air. The time step t = s4104   is used. For flow simulations, the wall and structure boundary conditions is 
considered as no-slip boundary condition requiring 0wu , where wu represents the flow velocity at wall or 
structure.

Fig. 5. The schematic four layers arrangement of the solid spheres immersed in the water. 
 
The computed snapshots of the simulation are shown as Fig. 6. One can see that the interface of free surface and the 
structure of particles are captured nicely by the proposed numerical method. It be also found that at t=0.9 s, the front of 
water has touched the structure. As t=1.5 s, it has generated the reflective wave. To investigate the dynamic loading 
event, the total impulse and the impulses due to particle collision and hydrodynamic force are shown in Fig. 7. For a 
time varying force, the cumulative impulse is calculated by the sum of the impact forces: 
   )( dttFI imp                                                                                            
(18) 
It shows that the impact to the structure induced by particle collision is bigger than by the hydrodynamic force.
