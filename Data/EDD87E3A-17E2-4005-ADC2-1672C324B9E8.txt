where Rj,i is the reaction rate of component i on the jth 
tray (kmol/s), νi is the stoichiometric coefficient which takes 
a negative value for the reactants, and Mj is the kinetic 
holdup on tray j (kmol) and takes a constant value 
throughout the simulation (This is typically true for catalyst 
weight based kinetics.) The relative volatilities of the 
components are in the following order:

The products C and D are the lightest and heaviest 
components, respectively, with the reactants A and B as 
middle boilers.

The heat of reaction vaporizes some liquid on each tray in 
this section. Therefore the vapor flow rate increases up 
through the reactive zone, while the liquid flow rate 
decreases down through the reactive zone.

the latent heat of vaporization (6944 cal/mol). The 
vapor-liquid equilibrium is assumed to be ideal and the

temperature.

3.3 Base case (6) 
Saturated liquid feeds were assumed, and two feed flow 
rates are 0.0126 kmol/s each with pure A (NF,A) or B (NF,B), 
which were introduced to the bottom (Nrxn,bot) or the top 
(Nrxn,top) of the reactive section. Figure 2 (thickest line) 
shows the composition profiles of all four components at the 
nominal design. As the feed location of component B moves 
down the column, the mole fraction of heavy reactant B (xB) 
increases toward the lower section of reactive zone, as can 
be seen in Fig. 2A. This rearrangement of the reactant 
composition certainly alters the “fraction of total 
conversion” (i.e., reaction rate in each tray divided by the 
overall reaction rate) as well as the temperature profile in 
the reactive zone. , Fig. 2B shows that the mole fraction of 
A increases toward the top of the reactive section (xA in Fig. 
2B) while the mole fraction of the heavy reactant B 
decreases (xB in Fig. 2B).

3.4 Optimal feed locations 
Finding the optimal feed locations can be formulated as 
an optimization problem in which the vapor rate is 
minimized by varying the feed tray locations.

In this work, a brute force approach is taken by fixing NF,A 
first while varying NF,B until a minimum VS is found. Next, 
NF,A is changed, and the procedure repeats itself until a 
global minimum is located. Figure 3 shows the variation of 
the vapor rate throughout the process.

4 Effects of relative volatilities 
A more difficult separation case (i.e., αA/αB=3/2) compared 
to the base case (i.e., αA/αB=4/2). With the conventional 
feed arrangement, we have 33% more energy consumption 
(0.0428 kmol/s), compared to that of the base case. This 
shows that, similar to the conventional distillation, difficult 
separation, even between reactants A and B, requires more 
energy. Moreover, the composition of A is higher toward 
the lower reactive zone as compared to the base case (cf. 
Figs. 4A) and this leads to a decrease in the product D 
composition which subsequently requires a larger vapor rate 
to meet the specification.  Following the optimization 
procedure, the result shows the optimum feed trays are 
NF,A=11 and NF,B=13 (Fig. 4B) which corresponds to a
