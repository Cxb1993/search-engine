Abstract 
 
This paper presents piecewise Lyapunov 
functions applied to analyze the stabilization 
of a piezoelectric actuator system with input 
time delay. Furthermore, a stability theorem 
is proposed to relax the limit conditions. The 
piezoelectric actuator system is represented 
by the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. 
According to the developed stability theorem, 
we find the feasible solution of feedback 
gains by linear matrix inequalities (LMI) and 
employ the strategy of parallel distributed 
compensation (PDC) to control the 
piezoelectric actuator system with input time 
delay. 
 
Keywords: Nano Positioning System, Fuzzy 
Lyapunov Function, TS Fuzzy Model. 
 
二、研究目的與文獻探討 
 
A piezoelectric platform has many 
advantages, e.g., small volume, large force, 
fast frequency response, and controllable 
micro-position. The piezoelectric actuator 
system owns the characteristics of hysteresis 
and creep effect, so it is important to study 
the stabilization of a piezoelectric actuator 
system. In this paper, the Bouc-Wen model 
[1] is adopted to represent the piezoelectric 
actuator system for the merits of less model 
parameters and easy design.  
The nonlinear Bouc-Wen equation is 
represented as the T-S fuzzy model via 
choosing linear terms by fuzzy IF-THEN 
rules. In the following, the parallel 
distributed compensation (PDC) approach is 
applied to design the nonlinear controller. 
Time delay often occurs in operations of 
many machines. It is very important to 
improve the phenomena of time delay which 
influence the performance of engineering 
systems [2-4]. The state time delay is not 
obvious in piezoelectric systems because the 
actuator has the advantage of fast frequency 
response. Therefore, only the input time 
delay is studied in this paper. Besides, 
external disturbances will deteriorate the 
control performance. A robust controller with 
a guaranteed performance in the H∞ sense is 
designed for the piezoelectric systems with 
un-modeled dynamics and external 
disturbances. 
In the stability analysis of fuzzy control 
systems, stability conditions are based on a 
common Lyapunov function. It is necessary 
to find a common positive definite matrix P 
 3
are used to characterize the Lyapunov 
function candidates [6].
