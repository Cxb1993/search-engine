I. INTRODUCTION
The applications of Inverse Heat Conduction Problems (IHCP) can be found in
several engineering fields in estimating thermal quantities, such as the determination
of unknown heat fluxes [1], thermal properties [2] and heat sources [3], etc, when the
geometry of the physical problems under consideration are known. However, when
the geometry of the problems is subjected to change and unknown, the technique of
Inverse Geometry Problem (IGP) should be used to estimate the position varying
domain configurations. Recently, thermal imaging, the application of Inverse
Geometry Problem, has become another area of active inverse problem research, and
much research has been devoted to infrared scanners and their applications to
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) [4] and shape identifications [5]. The approaches
taken to solve NDE or shape identification problems are based on either steady or
unsteady state response of a body subjected to thermal sources.
For the inverse geometry problem, due to its inherent nature, it requires a
complete regeneration of the mesh as the geometry evolves. Moreover, the continuous
evolution of the geometry itself poses certain difficulties in arriving at analytical or
numerical solutions. For this reason it is necessary to use an efficient technique that
can handle the problems with irregular surface geometry, especially in 3-D
applications.
The inverse geometry problems, including the cavity or shape estimation, have
been solved by a variety of numerical methods [6–10]. Huang and his co-workers
have utilized the conjugate gradient method (CGM) and boundary element technique
to the inverse geometry problems and have published a series of relevant papers.
Huang and Chao [11] first derived the formulations for determining the unknown
5The CGM is also called an iterative regularization method, which means the
regularization procedure is performed during the iterative processes and thus the
determination of optimal regularization conditions is not needed. The conjugate
gradient method derives from the perturbation principles and transforms the inverse
geometry problem to the solution of three problems, namely, the direct, sensitivity and
the adjoint problem.
These three problems are solved by CFD-RC and the calculated values are used
in CGM for inverse calculations. The bridge between CFD-RC and CGM is the
INPUT/OUTPUT files. Those files should be arranged such that their format can be
recognized by CFD-RC and CGM. A sequence of forward steady-state heat
conduction problems is solved by CFD-RC in an effort to update the boundary
geometry by minimizing a residual measuring the difference between estimated and
measured temperatures at the temperature extracting locations under the present
algorithm.
Finally the inverse solutions for this study with three different irregular surface
geometries will be illustrated to show the validity of using CGM in the present 3-D
inverse geometry problem.
II. THE DIRECT PROBLEM
To illustrate the methodology for developing expressions for use in determining
unknown boundary geometry in a homogeneous medium, we consider the following
three-dimensional steady state inverse heat conduction problem. For a domain , the
boundary conditions on four side surfaces S1, S2, S3 and S4 are all assumed insulated,
on the bottom surface Sbottom, a constant heat flux q is taken away from the boundary
by cooling while the boundary condition on the top surface Stop, z = f(x,y), maintains
at an uniform temperature T0. Figure 1 shows the geometry and the coordinates for the
three-dimensional physical problem considered here. The mathematical formulation of
this steady-state heat conduction problem in dimensional form is given by:
7shape identification problem can be stated as follows: by utilizing the above
mentioned measured temperature data Ym(Sbottom), estimate the unknown geometry of
the top surface, z = f(x,y).
The solution of the present inverse geometry problem is to be obtained in such a
way that the following functional is minimized:

( 2 )
where (x-xm) and (y-ym) are the Dirac delta function and Tm are the estimated or
computed temperatures on the measured positions (xm,ym) on Sbottom. These quantities
are determined from the solution of the direct problem given previously by using
estimated boundary geometry for the exact f(x,y).
IV. CONJUGATE GRADIENT METHOD FOR MINIMIZATION
The Conjugate Gradient Method itself may not ensure the global minimum;
however, if the objective function is properly defined and in a quadratic form, like the
definition in Equation (2), the global minimum for this objective function is
guaranteed.
The following iterative process based on the conjugate gradient method [11-15]
is now used for the estimation of unknown boundary geometry f(x,y) by minimizing
the functional J[f(x,y)]
n 1 n n nf (x,y) f (x,y) P (x,y)   for n = 0,1,2,........ (3)
wheren is the search step size in going from iteration n to iteration n+1, and Pn(x,y)
is the direction of descent (i.e. search direction) given by

The commercial package CFD-RC is used to solve the above sensitivity
problem.
The functional n 1J(f ) for iteration n+1 is obtained by rewriting equation (2) as

where we have replaced n+1f (x,y) by the expression given by equation (3). If
temperature n n nT(x,y,z;f P ) is linearized by a Taylor expansion, equation (7)
takes the form

where nT(x,y,x;f ) is the solution of the direct problem by using the estimated
nf (x,y) for exact f(x,y) on the top surface Stop. The sensitivity functions
nT((x,y,x;P ) are taken as the solutions of problem (6) at the measured positions (xm,
ym) on Sbottom by letting nPf  . The search step size n is determined by
minimizing the functional given by equation (8) with respect ton . The following

VII. STOPPING CRITERION
If the problem contains no measurement errors, the traditional check condition
is specified as
n 1J [f (x,y)]  (16)
where is a small specified number. However, the temperature reading taken by
infrared scanners may contain measurement errors. Therefore, it is not expected that
the functional equation (2) to be equal to zero at the final iteration step. Following the
experience of the authors [1,11-15], the discrepancy principle is utilized as the
stopping criterion, i.e. the temperature residuals may be approximated by

To illustrate the validity of CGM in identifying irregular boundary configuration
z = f(x,y) in a 3-D inverse geometry problem based on the knowledge of the simulated
temperature recordings taken by infrared scanners on the bottom surface Sbottom, we
consider three specific examples where the surface geometry on Stop, z = f(x,y), are
assumed as three different functions, the first two are the combination of sine and
cosine functions and the third one is a step function.
The objective of this article is to show the accuracy of CGM in estimating f(x,y)
with no prior information on the functional form of the unknown quantities, which is
the so-called function estimation.
In order to compare the results for situations involving random measurement
errors, we assume normally distributed uncorrelated errors with zero mean and
constant standard deviation. The simulated inexact measurement data Y can be
expressed as
Y = Ydir + (19)
where Ydir is the solution of the direct problem with an exact f(x,y); is the standard
deviation of the measurement error; and is a random variable that generated by
subroutine DRNNOR of the IMSL [19] and will be within -2.576 to 2.576 for a 99%
confidence bounds.
One of the advantages of using the conjugate gradient method is that it does not
require a very accurate initial guess of the unknown quantities, this can be verified in
the following numerical experiments.
To discuss the effect of grid number on the calculated temperatures for the
direct problem, a benchmark problem with Lx (length in x direction) = Ly (length in y
direction) = 0.5 m, Lz (length in z direction) = 0.1 m, q =5000 W/m2 and T0 = 200oC
is considered. The grid number in x, y and z directions are 31 31 11  , 51 51 21  ,
71 71 31  and 111 111 51  , respectively. The case for 111 111 51  grid system is
regarded as the true solution for the benchmark problem.
The relative errors between the true and computed temperatures on Sbottom for
31 31 11  , 51 51 21  and 71 71 31  grid system are calculated as 6.32%, 0.98%
15
here N = 51 and M = 51 represent the total discreted number of grid in x and y
directions, respectively, and (N M) indicates the total number of the unknown
parameters, while f and f denote the exact and estimated values of surface
configurations.
It can be seen from the above figures and relative average errors that the
present inverse scheme obtained good estimation for f(x,y) and the CPU time on
Pentium IV-3 GHz PC is about 1 hour and 22 minutes.
Next, let us examine what will happen when different initial guess is considered.
The computational situations are the same as the previous one except that the initial
guess is now chosen as f(x,y)0 = 0.15 m. Using stopping criterion = 0.2, after 25
iterations the inverse solutions for the estimated surface shapes and estimated
temperatures are obtained and the relative average errors ERR1 and ERR2 are
calculated as ERR1 = 1.12 % and ERR2 = 0.0013 %, respectively. The results are
similar to those with f(x,y)0 = 0.05 m. The CPU time (on Pentium IV-3.00 GHz PC)
used in the CGM is about 1 hour and 17 minutes. Again, it is clear from the relative
average errors that the estimated f(x,y) is still very accurate when using different
initial guess for surface shapes.
Finally, let us discuss the influence of the measurement errors on the inverse
solutions. The largest temperature difference between all measured temperatures is
about 2oC in the present test case, therefore too large measurement error will be out of
its physical significant. For this reason the inclusion of the measurement error will
depend on the largest temperature difference on Sbottom in the error analysis examples.
First, the measurement error for the simulated temperatures measured by
infrared scanners on bottom surface Sbottom is taken as = 0.11 (about 5 % of the
largest temperature difference on Sbottom). The estimations for f(x,y) can be obtained
after only 13 iterations (CPU time is about 40 minutes) and plotted in Figure 4(a). The
relative average errors ERR1 and ERR2 are calculated as ERR1 = 1.61 % and ERR2 =
0.0182 %, respectively. The measurement error for the temperatures is then increased
to= 0.22 (about 10 % of the largest temperature difference on Sbottom). After only 7
17
on the bottom surface Sbottom is taken as= 0.07 (about 5 % of the largest temperature
difference on Sbottom). After 34 iterations (CPU time is about 1 hour and 32 minutes),
the estimated f(x,y) can be obtained and shown in Figure 8(a). The relative average
errors ERR1 and ERR2 are calculated as ERR1 = 2.46 % and ERR2 = 0.0115 %,
respectively. Then, the measurement error for the temperatures is increased to =
0.14 (about 10 % of the largest temperature difference on Sbottom). The estimated f(x,y)
can be obtained after only 14 iterations (CPU time is about 39 minutes) and plotted in
Figure 8(b). ERR1 and ERR2 are calculated as 3.28 % and 0.0232 %, respectively.
From Figures 8(a) and 8(b) we concluded that the reliable inverse solutions can still
be obtained when large measurement errors are considered.
Numerical test case 3
In the third test case, a stricter test case for f(x,y) is taken as a step function, i.e.
0.04+0.02 y ; 0 x<0.1
f(x,y)= 0.02+0.01 y ; 0.1 x<0.4
0.05 0.02 y ; 0.4 x 0.5
 
  
    
(23)
where the initial guess for this test case is chosen as z = f(x,y)0 = 0.02 m.
By using q =5000,= 0.0 and= 1.71, after only 19 iterations, the exact and
estimated functions of f(x,y) are shown in Figures 9(a) and 9(b), respectively. The
measured and estimated surface temperatures on Sbottom are illustrated in Figures 10(a)
and 10(b), respectively. The average relative errors are calculated ERR1 = 4.98 % and
ERR2 = 0.0042 %, respectively.
The estimated surface shape is not so accurate near the discontinuity region, but
the estimated temperatures are still match very well with the measured temperatures
on Sbottom. Based on Figures (9) and (10) it is concluded that CGM can be used to
obtain good estimation for f(x,y) and the CPU time (on Pentium IV-3.00 GHz PC)
used in the CGM is about 48 minutes.
Next, measurement errors will be considered in the numerical experiments. First
the measurement error is taken as = 0.15 (about 5 % of the largest temperature
difference on Sbottom). After only 6 iterations (CPU time is about 14 minutes), the
