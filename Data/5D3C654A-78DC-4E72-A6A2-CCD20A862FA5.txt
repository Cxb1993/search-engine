penetrate into brain parenchyma. To monitor the BBB 
opening process from MRI, current approach is to 
employ contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging by 
using gadopentetate dimeglumine injection 
intravenously. However, the contrast enhancement is 
typically 20%, unable to distinct safe BBB disruption 
from hemorrhage, its unknown toxicity when entering 
into brain parenchyma, and difficult to modify the 
particle to be specific-molecule or specific-antibody 
targetable for molecular/ disease targeting imaging 
purpose. Our research team recently showed that the 
superparamagnetic iron-oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles as 
a contrast agent in contrast-enhanced T2- or T2*-
weighted MRI can be another approach in the detection 
of focused-ultrasound induced BBB opening. Major 
advantages of this approach includes (1) the sequence 
is superior in the detection of potential 
microhemorrhage during the sonication process, (2) a 
higher contrast change (typically > 50%), and more 
importantly, (3) the flexibility in the surface 
modification to coat specific ligand or antibody and 
for the use of targeting imaging. As a sub-project of 
the general goal on ＇establishing a molecular 
imaging-based translational platform for pre-clinical 
studies of drug delivery＇, our specific role here is 
to establish the core technology – focused 
ultrasound induced BBB-opening – and successfully 
transfer it to other sub-projects for their novel 
imaging technology developments. Specific aim of this 
proposal includes: (1) to establish the technology of 
SPIO-enhanced MRI for monitoring focused ultrasound 
induced BBB-opening, and (2) to develop the EGFR-
antibody-coated SPIO nanoparticles for brain tumor 
targeting during the focused ultrasound treatment for 
further investigation of tumor drug-delivery 
strategy. Three year working progress is proposed. 
The specific aim of the first year is to established 
the MRI-guided focused ultrasound treatment 
platform； in the second year, we aim to embed the 
SPIO-enhanced MRI technology into the platform； in 
the third year, we aim to develop EGFR-antibody-
coated SPIO nanoparticles as image-targeting tool no

(Background Introduction) 
Within the central nervous system (CNS) the blood–brain barrier (BBB) 
excludes larger (> 400 Da) molecules from entering the brain parenchyma, protecting 
it from toxic foreign substances. However, it also prohibits delivery of many 
potentially effective diagnostic or therapeutic agents and restricts the enhanced 
permeability and retention (EPR) of therapeutic nanoparticles. Many factors affect 
EPR, including the pH, polarity, and size of the delivered substance. Even when 
pathologies compromise the integrity or function of the BBB, EPR can be limited by 
microenvironmental characteristics such as hypovascularity, fibrosis or necrosis. 
In the presence of microbubbles and using a low-energy burst tone, focused 
ultrasound (FUS) can increase the permeability of the BBB. This noninvasive 
procedure disrupts the BBB locally rather than systemically, minimizing off-target 
effects. Furthermore, the disruption is reversible within several hours, providing a 
window of opportunity to achieve local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents in brains 
with either intact or compromised BBBs. However, drug delivery in such cases is 
passive, relying on the free diffusion of the agents across the barrier. 
Advances in nanotechnology and molecular biology have allowed development 
of novel nanomedical platforms. Such approaches allow simultaneous diagnostic 
imaging and drug delivery monitoring in vivo in real time. Magnetic nanoparticles 
(MNPs) have intrinsic magnetic properties that enable their use as contrast agents in 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because MNPs are also sensitive to external 
magnetic forces, magnetic targeting (MT) actively enhances their deposition at the 
target site, increasing the therapeutic dose delivered beyond that obtainable by passive 
diffusion. 
At least 18,000 patients are diagnosed with malignant primary brain tumors in 
the United States each year. More than half these cases have glioblastoma multiforme 
(GBM), making this the most common malignant brain tumor in adults1. GBM has 
been also confirmed to heterogeneously disrupt the blood–brain barrier (BBB) locally, 
Thus, permeability can vary widely within different areas of the same tumor, and 
permeability does not necessarily correlate with tumor histology, size, or anatomical 
location2,3. The delivery of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) is current an 
important chemotherapeutic therapy for GBM. However, randomized prospective 
trials document only a small benefit in short-term survival and no benefit in medium 
and long-term trials4 due to the insufficient dose accumulation in the target tumor. 
Burst-mode focused ultrasound has been confirmed to be able to disrupt the BBB5 and 
have the potential to increase permeability of chemotherapeutic drugs to brain 
parenchyma without causing neuronal damage6. Compared to other approaches for 
enhancing BCNU delivery into brain (e.g., treatment with modified lipophilic 
chemicals or infusion of hypertonic solutions through the carotid artery; 8), focused 
ultrasound provides a more attractive means to locally disrupt the BBB and increase 
local concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of GBM.  
It has been recently discovered that focused ultrasound can locally and reversibly 
disrupt blood-brain barrier, which opens new frontier toward delivering therapeutic 
6 
 
Focused ultrasound has been discovered to be able to locally and reversibly 
increase the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). However, inappropriate 
sonication of the BBB may cause complications such as hemorrhage and brain tissue 
damage. Tissue damage may be controlled by selecting the optimal sonication 
parameters. In this study, we sought to investigate the feasibility of labeling cells with 
SPIO particles to assess the inflammatory response during focused-ultrasound 
induced BBB opening. We demonstrate that infiltration of phagocytes does not occur 
using optimal parameters of sonication. Taken together, our results support the 
usefulness and safety of focused-ultrasound induced BBB opening for enhancing drug 
delivery to brain. These findings may have implications for optimization of sonication 
parameters. 
Main finding: As shown in Fig. 1(b), BBB disruption was obtained either using 
multiple sonications at an acoustic pressure of 1.1 MPa (upper panel) or a single 
sonication at the high acoustic pressure of 2.45 MPa (lower panel). Repeated 
sonications at 1.1 MPa resulted in a larger area of BBB opening compared with that 
obtained using a single high-pressure sonication (2 mm in diameter at the focal depth). 
Only few areas of erythrocyte extravasations were evident in regions of BBB opening 
following sonications at 1.1 MPa. In the contrast, a single 2.45-MPa sonication 
produced a severe intracerebral hemorrhage (red arrow) within the area of BBB 
disruption (white arrow).

blue-dyed brain sections sonicated at 1.1 MPa (resulting in BBB opening) and  2.45 
MPa (resulting in BBB opening complicated by intracerebral hemorrhage). Black dots 
indicate the patterns of sonications used in the two protocols. 
 
Figure 2 shows MRI images of control animals and of those receiving SPIO. 
Gd-enhanced T1 images showed an increase in hyperintense signal at two sites of 
sonication sites (left panel: six sonications at 1.1 MPa; right panel: single sonication at

Figure 3 shows the reconstructed hypointense volume in the same animals used 
for the experiments reported in Figure 1. The hypointense volume in SPIO-negative 
rats was found to be rather unchanged (ranging; 0.61–0.76 mm3), whereas an 
apparent increase was evident in SPIO-treated animals (from 0.19 mm3 at 0.5 hours 
to 1.87 mm3 at 24 hours, a nearly nine-fold increase in this case).  
 
 
Fig. 3. Reconstruction of the hypointense volume presented in Fig. 3 from T2*-MRI.  
 
The occurrence of an inflammatory response in areas of BBB opening is also 
evident in T2* images obtained at 3 hours. Figure 4 shows the analysis of MRI SI 
time course in SPIO-treated animals. Five selected regions are zoomed and depicted 
(Fig. 4(a)) including blood vessels neighboring to brain (regions 1 and 2), brain areas 
sonicated at 1.1 and 2.45 MPa (regions 3 and 5), and midbrain artery (region 4). 
Ultrasonic energy was delivered at 10 minutes after initiation of T2* scans (arrow). 
Five selected time points are shown in Fig. 6(b), and the corresponding time changes 
in SI were recorded accordingly (Fig. 4(c)). As shown in Fig. 4, multiple sonications 
at 1.1 MPa (region 3) did not result in the occurrence of brain hemorrhagic damage 
and no apparent signal change was evident. In addition, there was no apparent 
SPIO-laden monocyte inflitration in these areas. Conversely, a single sonication at 
2.45 MPa induced formation of intracerebral hemorrhage that resulted in turn in an 
immediate 10% signal drop, followed by another gradual decrease. The total drop in 
the SI at the end of the imaging was 15% at the end of 3-hour. These findings suggest 
a continuous infiltration of SPIO-labeled macrophages at sites sonicated at 2.45 MPa. 
Of interest is also the observation that an approximately 30% SI drop was evident in 
selected neighboring blood vessels. This drop peaked at about 60 minutes and 
subsequently recovered to baseline values. A similar pattern of SI drop was detected 
in the midbrain artery (region 4), albeit to a lesser extent (approximately 12% from 
baseline values). The pattern in SI changes in circulatory areas (regions 1, 2, and 4) 
was characterized by a quick SI rebound. This suggests that SPIO-laden macrophages

sonicated at 2.45 MPa, either without or with SPIO administration at 24 hours before 
sonication, respectively. Sonications at 2.45 MPa resulted in a significant macrophage 
infiltration at the site of sonication. Notably, the use of SPIO allowed the tracking of 
the inflammatory response in vivo (arrows). Bar = 50 μm. 
 
Significance of this study:  
 In the present study, we have demonstrated that the brain inflammatory response 
that accompanies ultrasound–induced BBB disruption can be detected using the 
cell-labeling MRI technique. Our findings may have implications for optimization of 
ultrasound parameters. The result has been submitted to the Journal of Cerebral 
Blood Flow & Metabolism after the summarization, and has been accepted / published:

2. Opening of the Blood-Brain Barrier By Low-Frequency (28-kHz) Ultrasound:  
A Novel Pinhole-Assisted Mechanical Scanning Device

Fig. 7. Ultrasonic field distribution obtained using the Schlieren techniques. The 
ultrasound probe was steered at different tilting angles: (a)–30; (b) 0 (perpendicular 
to the animal brain); and (c) +30. The bars in each figure indicate 1 cm.  
 
We subsequently investigated whether our low-frequency ultrasound system 
allowed the opening of the BBB. Section of brains sonicated at 28-kHz at different 
time intervals (from 4 to 10 min) are shown in Figure 8. The PRF and pulse duration 
were kept constant in all experiments at 1 Hz and 10 ms, respectively. Sonication for 
4 min) did not result in BBB opening (occurrence rate = 0%), which was confirmed 
by no Evans blue stains been observed from brain section. In contrast, disruption of 
the BBB occurred when the brains were sonicated for 6 min (occurrence rate = 50%) 
or 8-10 minutes (occurrence rate = 100%), and the BBB disruption regions were 
clearly stained on brain sections by Evans blue (regions presenting in blue-color stains 
in Fig. 8(b)-(d); contours were added for better identify their distributions). A longer 
sonication time resulted in a larger area of BBB disruption and in a deeper penetration 
into the brain. During the 10-min sonication, the area of BBB opening was detected 
not only in the axial but also in the lateral direction. At the fixed PRF and pulse 
duration, a sonication duration of 6 minutes was regarded as the minimal threshold 
required for BBB opening and this value was used as a reference in the following 
experiments. 
 
14 
 
 
Fig. 9. HE stains of the sonicated brain shown in Fig. 4. After 4- and 6-min 
sonications (in (a) and (b)), there was no hemorrhagic damage. After a 8-min 
sonication (in (c)), discontinuous erythrocyte extravasations were occasionally present 
on the brain surface (cortex). After a 10-min sonication (in (d)), microhemorrhagic 
damage was clearly evident. When the brains were sonicated for 4 minutes, BBB 
disruption did not occur. Arrows indicate extravasations and microhemorrhages.  
 
We subsequently focused on the effect of the different pulse durations. Sections 
of the brains sonicated at different pulse durations (ranging from 50 to 100 ms) are 
depicted in Figures 10(a) and 10(b). In all experiments, PRF and sonication time were 
kept constant at 1 Hz and 6 min, respectively. Such sections were compared with 
those obtained in sonications at a 10-ms burst-length. Results showed that an increase 
in burst lenght from 50 to 100 ms resulted in an increased penetration of 
BBB-opening that extended from the brain surface to the inner regions, but the 
hemorrhage level was increased from 1 to 2 in average.

100 ms, exposure time = 6 min.. 
Significance of this study:  
In this study we have shown that low-frequency sonication at 28-kHz with the 
use of a pinhole-assisted mechanical scanning apparatus may effectively induce BBB 
opening in an experimental rat model. To our knowledge, this is the first sonication 
system that uses non-focused ultrasound to elicit BBB disruption. In addition, the 
ultrasound frequency used in this study was the lowest reported thus far for this 
purpose. Our system allowed to obtain areas of BBB opening ranging in size from 
millimeters to centimeters with little or no hemorrhagic damage. The dimension of the 
ultrasonic beam obtained with our system was larger (~5 mm at any depth) than those 
obtained with high-frequency ultrasound (e.g. 2–3 mm at the focal depth using 1-MHz 
spherical focused ultrasound). These features clearly indicate the potential usefulness 
of our system for the treatment of superficial brain tumors. Given its high portability, 
our technique may have inherent advantages when large brain areas need sonications 
for drug delivery (e.g. acute stroke or traumatic brain injury).

selected for all subsequent focused ultrasound treatments on animals with induced

The effects of various treatment protocols were assessed over time by MRI and 
summarized in Fig. 14. Fig. 14(a) and 14(b) show the measured tumor area in a 
weekly base ((a) shows individual tumor area and (b) demonstrate the corresponded 
mean and S.D. value), and Fig. 14(c) shows the relative tumor size increase (in % 
compared to the area measured in Day 10). Control rats or those receiving only 
BCNU showed similar patterns of tumor growth, except that control rats showed 
steady tumor growth whereas those in BCNU-treated animals showed a transient 
retention of tumor size immediately after BCNU administration; tumor growth 
recurred subsequently. BCNU treatment alone did not suppress tumor progression 
overall. Although both the mean and maximal survival times improved, there was no 
statistically significant increase in the median survival time relative to controls (see 
Fig. 14(d)). In contrast, when rats were pretreated with focused ultrasound before 
BCNU injection, the signal intensity-enhanced regions disappeared completely in 
most animals except for the lesion caused by the initial tumor cell implant and tumor 
size decreased significantly.

Significance of this study:  
This study demonstrates that focused ultrasound treatment serves a noninvasive 
method for the targeted delivery of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea through the 
blood–brain barrier such that the chemotherapeutic drug dosage can be increased 
specifically in the tumor region, significantly suppressing tumor growth and 
prolonging animal survival. Because BCNU is already an FDA-approved 
chemotherapeutic drug for glioblastoma, this procedure could be highly clinically 
relevant, and this study might advance the use of chemotherapy to treat patients with 
central nervous system malignancies.

4. Focused ultrasound induced BBB opening and MRI validation 
MRI contrast enhancement and MNP quantification in vivo.  The enhancement of 
local MNP delivery into brain via combined FUS and MT was evaluated. 
Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images confirmed that FUS disrupted the BBB. R2 
maps (showing changes caused by different amounts of MNP) and T2* imaging 
(indicating susceptibility-artifact-induced signal loss caused by MNP accumulation) 
showed that FUS treatment alone increased local deposition of MNP-3 by 21.5% 
relative to the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 15). Subsequently applying MT 
increased MNP accumulation, with a 6-hour exposure causing the greatest increase in 
MNP concentration (244.6% relative to the contralateral hemisphere) but also a wider 
distribution (as seen in T2* imaging) relative to brains treated with FUS alone (Fig. 
1.1). The combination of FUS and 6 h of MT deposited 21,738 ± 3,477 ng of 
epirubicin/g of brain tissue, whereas treatment with FUS alone accumulated only 
1,336 ± 1,182 ng epirubicin/g of tissue. Furthermore, local MNP capture was 
dependent on field strength: A 0.55-Tesla (T) magnet attracted four times more MNPs 
than a 0.18-T magnet, as assessed by R2 mapping.  
 
22 
 
Enhancement of therapeutic MNP delivery to brain tumors. Tumor-bearing animals 
were treated with epirubicin–MNP either without (control) or with combined FUS/MT 
treatment. Control animals showed no MNP accumulation in the tumor region 6 h 
after epirubicin–MNP administration (Fig. 17(a)). However, relaxation rates increased 
2.6-fold (to 35.8 ± 5.2 relative to control values of 13.6 ± 4.5) at the tumor site by 
applying MT for 6 h after FUS treatment (Fig. 17(c)). After correcting for the baseline 
value contributed by blood circulation, it was estimated that 0.16 ± 0.03 mM of MNPs 
was delivered to the tumor, equivalent to 11,982 ± 2,105 ng of epirubicin per g of 
tissue. This is ~15-fold higher than the therapeutic range (819 ± 482 ng/g tumor) 
reported for in vivo doxorubicin, which has a clinical response rate of 39% in patients 
with breast carcinoma. Furthermore, TEM showed that FUS apparently induced 
interendothelial clefts with no obvious tight-junctional complexes in tumors (Fig. 
17(d)), and that epirubicin–MNPs were taken up by tumor cells and macrophages (Fig. 
17(f)).

二、與會心得 
血腦屏障(Blood-brain barrier, BBB) 是由內皮組織形成的緊密結點，指在血
管和腦之間有一種選擇性地阻止某些物質由血進入腦的〝屏障〞。血腦屏障幾乎

等。惡性腫瘤之病人一旦進入腫瘤晚期存活率往往僅有數個月。年輕病患在病患
腫瘤切除後必須繼續作放射線治療。然而，成年人原發性腦瘤中最惡性的神經膠
母細胞瘤僅接受手術療法的中央生存期(median survival)是 4個月，而放射線療法
亦只有有 5個月的延命效果。顯示目前腦瘤治療方式成效相當有限。而化學藥物
治療在相對年紀較經、中等惡性度和復發腫瘤上扮演重要的治療角色，通常以
nitrosourea為第一選擇藥劑，ACNU治療惡性神經膠質瘤的有效率為四七％；近
年來口服 Temozolamicle 是一新的選擇化療藥劑。然而，腦腫瘤之藥物
EPR(enhanced permeability-and-retention)效果已被證實不佳，無法延長病人之生
存率，而化療藥物目前治療腦腫瘤之重要策略即在於如何提高化療藥物之局部
EPR效果。(資料來源: http://www.kmuh.org.tw/www/ns/service03Braintumor.htm) 
因此，聚焦式超音波增強局部血管之策略將是提高腦瘤化療藥物濃度一個相當有
潛力的方式。
