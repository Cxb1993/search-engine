3. Formulations and Theoretical Backgrounds
3.1 Direct Trefftz method
Considering a two-dimensional finite domain 
enclosed by the boundary, the governing equation for
the potential problem is the Laplace’s equation, i.e.,
 xu ,0)()λ( 22 x , (1)
where 2 is the Laplacian operator, )(xu is the
potential function at x , and  is the wave number.
Let a weighted function set  )(xiW contain
weighted functions, Wi(x) (the i-th basis function),
which satisfy the modified Helmholtz equation, i.e.
0)()( 22  xiW , x . (2)
Considering a simply-connected domain and
adopting the following bases functions:

where I m and K m are the m-th Bessel function, r is
the distance between source point and field point, and
 is the angle between the x axis and the radial direc-
tion of the field point. The direct boundary-type Trefftz
integral equation can be obtained by the use of Green’s
second identity as

where n denotes the out-normal direction at the
boundary point x . Now consider the boundary condi-
tion as
  tu , (6)
where

tial,  and  are both arbitrary constants with a
normalization relationship as 122  . Let




substituting them into equation (5) yields the relation

tion as

The discrete form of equation (5) can be expressed as
Aξ= ( T–U )η. (6)
In Eq. (6), the given conditions are ηvector and the
unknown physical quantity can be transformed as ξ
vector. The element in A matrix can be expressed as
ijjijjij TUA  A . (7)
By adopting the constant element scheme, the compo-
nents inU , and T respectively, can be written as
  j dWU iij )()( xx , (8)

where
j denotes the j -th constant element on the
boundary. It should be noted that
ijU is the integration
of the i-th basis function along the j-th element. Since
the direct Trefftz method can obtain the normal deriva-
tive (boundary physical quantity) by the given potential,
it cannot describe the potential distribution in the pre-
scribed domain.
3.2 Indirect Trefftz method
The potential function u can be described by using
a linear combination of the bases functions and the
unknown parameters as
aw T

wau iij

in which ia is the unknown parameter, 、
)(xii ww  , w、a are row vectors and n represents
the normal direction. Now, assume
n
u
t

 and the
boundary condition as
  tu . (12)
By using the weighted residual method to approximate
the boundary integral equation such that the error can
be minimized, we have
0)())((  xdtuxp  . (13)
If )()( xxp wi ， it becomes the symmetric Treffts
method; while if 1)( xp ， it becomes the
un-symmetric Trefftz method. Now assume 1)( xp
and substitute Eq. (10) and (11) into Eq. (13) and move
 to the right hand side, then we have the relation of
the i-th basis function corresponding to the j-th element
as
 



   jijii dadn

(14)
or in matrix form as
ηa B . (15)
For the element in matrix B, we have
ijjijjji TUB  B . (16)
Comparing Eqs. (16) and (7), it is found that A and B
are transposed each other and operations of the coeffi-
cients
j and j are the same as those in the direct
Trefftz method. In Eq. (14), the integration term at the
right hand side represents the length of the element, the
constant  represents the given boundary value, a i
is unknown, and all the elements in matrix B are given;
therefore, when the a i is obtained, the potential dis-
tribution in the domain and the boundary quantity can
be yielded by substituting a i into Eqs. (10) and (11) .
