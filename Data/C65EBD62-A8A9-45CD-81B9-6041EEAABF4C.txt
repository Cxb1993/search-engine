1. Introduction 
     Process capability indices have been proposed to manufactur ing industry, providing 
numerical measures on whether a process is capable of reproducing items meeting the quality 
requirement preset by the product designer or customers. Kane (1986) discussed two most 
frequently applied process capability indices, Cp and Cpk, which are respectively defined as 
follows:

where USL and LSL are respectively the upper and lower specification limits of the process 
characteristic, and m  and s  are respectively the mean and standard deviation of the process 
characteristic. It was noted that the index Cpk only provides an approximate rather than an exact 
measure of process yield (proportion of conformities), and therefore, on the assumption of 
normality, Boyles (1994) presented the process yield measure (in percentage) which is given by  
        %Yield ú

where )(×F  is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. To obtain 
an exact measure of process yield, Boyles (1994) defined a yield index, denoted by Spk, for 
processes with normal characteristics. According to his definition, the process index Spk may be 
mathematically expressed by

pkS ,                  (4) 
where )(1 ×F-  is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. 
Based on Eq. (4), we may have the relationship between %Yield and Spk as follows: 
        %Yield 1)3(2 -F= pkS .                                     (5) 
Obviously, from Eq. (5), this is a one-to-one relationship, and consequently the yield index Spk 
 6 
from Eq. (6), that

                        (7) 
and the percentage of the ith-stream yield may be related to Spki as follows: 
 Pi = 1)3(2 -F pkiS .          (8) 
Thus, a one-to-one relationship between the index MpkS  and the overall process yield, denoted by 
P, can be written by 
        [ ]å å

Example 1 demonstrates a numerical case showing how the point estimation of MpkS  may be 
obtained by the procedure proposed by Wang et al. (2009). 
 
Example 1  In a wafer package plant, the modules are provided to accommodate packages by a 
multi- function auto molding system. Suppose that the temperature (in Co ) of the module is a key 
process characteristic with the specification C0.3175 o± . Four cavity-chase temperature data 
were measured from the MSP under study, and 130 measurements of data for each chase were 
collected from the plant. The point estimate of the overall yield index MpkS  can be obtained by 
following steps: 
Step 1. Obtain the point estimate of Spk for each stream by

3. The sampling distribution of multiple-stream yield index 
The sampling distribution of MpkSˆ  is the base for constructing the confidence interva l of 
M
pkS . To find the sampling distribution of 
M
pkSˆ , the method of distribution functions (see 
Wackerly et al. 2002) is employed. Let )(ˆ xF M
pkS
 be the cumulative distribution function of MpkSˆ . 
Then, according to both the definition of the cumulative function and Eq. (13), )(ˆ xF M
pkS
 may be 
transformed to the cumulative distribution function of Pˆ , denoted by )(ˆ ×PF , as follows: 
( ) )1)3(2ˆPr(ˆ1

       = ( )1)3(2ˆ -F xFP .           (14) 
It is noted from Eq. (14) that the probability distribution of Pˆ  determines the sampling 
distribution of MpkSˆ . From Eq. (12), it may be seen that Pˆ  is a linear combination of iPˆ , for i = 
1, 2, … , k, and iPˆ  is the estimator of the percentage of yield for the ith stream. Based on Central 
Limit Theorem, if the sample size from each stream is sufficiently large (i.e., practically 30³n ), 
then iPˆ  is approximately normally distributed with mean Pi and variance nPP ii /)1( - . Since 
Pˆ  is a linear combination of iPˆ , it can be shown that Pˆ  is also approximately normally 
distributed, but with mean Pm  and variance

For example, from Table 4, if 98.0=Pm  and 0001.0
2 =Ps , then we can read that the lower and 
upper 95% confidence interval limits of MpkS  are respectively 0.65447 and 0.85408, and the point 
estimate of MpkS  (i.e., the expected value of 
M
pkSˆ ) is 0.72336.

5. An illustrative example 
The case under study is drawn from a company located in Touliu, Taiwan. There are thirty 
sets of auto-molding systems in the plant, which is an important part of wafer manufactur ing 
industries, each auto-molding system having eight cavities (streams). The temperature is the key 
characteristic for the auto-molding system, and there is a unique production specification in the 
auto-molding system. The temperature of each stream must be controlled and monitored at the 
same time, which has a significant impact on product quality and reliability. The eight cavities 
(streams) temperature data were measured from the auto-molding system, and total of 150 
measurements for each stream were collected. Suppose that the specification for the temperature 
(in Co ) of the modules is C0.3175 o± .  
From the data of chase 1, we obtained that 963.1751 =X , 905.01 =S , m = 175 and d = 3, and 
consequently, 321.0/)(ˆ 11 =-= dmXCdr , 302.0/ˆ 11 == dSCdp ,

[5,6,7]. In recent years, there have been a number of articles published which focus on the method of determining the 
optimal parameter settings of a dynamic multiple response problem [8,9,10]. Moreover, the approached an artificial 
neural  network (ANN) to construct the responses model of the dynamic responses and applied desirability 
functions to integrate three types of dynamic responses into a single index [11]. The general regression neural 
network (GRNN) is similar in form to the probabilistic neural network (PNN).Whereas PNN finds decision 
boundaries between categories of patterns, GRNN estimates values for continuous dependent variables. Both do so 
through the use of nonparametric estimators of probability density function [12]. The main disadvantage of GRNN 
relative to other techniques is that it requires substantial computation to evaluate new points. There are several ways 
to overcome this disadvantage. One is to use the clustering versions of GRNN. Another is to take advantage of the 
inherent parallel structure of this network and design semiconductor chips to do the computation. The two in 
combination provide high throughput and rapid adaptation.   In this paper, the general regression neural network 
(GRNN) is applied build up the relationships between the process parameters and the multiple quality characteristics. 
The proportional distribution for multiple objective particle swarm optimization (PD-MOPSO) is used to find out 
non-dominated set and Pareto optimal solutions. It can provide a methodology of optimization parametric design of 
multiple quality characteristics. 
 
II. METHODOLOGY 
Neural networks are able to learn and model, relatively quickly, process behaviour where a priori knowledge of the 
associated scientific principles is not available or extremely difficult to obtain. The growing interest and applications 
of neural networks is greatly due to the desirable properties that these devices offer. While the GRNN is a 
feedforward network requiring supervised training. GRNN’s feature fast training times, can model nonlinear 
functions, and have been shown to perform well in noisy environments given enough data. The primary advantage of 
the GRNN is the speed at which the network can be trained. Training a GRNN is performed in one pass of the 
training data through the network, the training data values are copied to become the weight vectors between layers 
[13]. In this paper, the GRNN is used to construct the relationship function between parameters and response.  
Particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is a population-based evolutionary algorithm. For functional optimization, every 
potential solution is considered as a particle. Particles in the group are initialized stochastically in the entire 
D-dimensional solution space. During a run, particles update their velocities and positions according to the best 
solution found so far by themselves and the entire group. It can be explained mathematically as follows [14]: 
)()( 2211 idgdidididid xprcxprcvwv -´´+-´´+´=                                  (1)

Where idv is the dth dimension in the velocity vector of the ith particle, so ),...,( 21 iDiii vvvV = presents the 
particle ’s displacement in each iteration; similarly, idx is the dth dimension in the position vector of the ith particles,
