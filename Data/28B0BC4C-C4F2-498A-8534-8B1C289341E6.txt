discussion more clear, we formally introduce our terminology
in the following.
The nth raw moment m′k (i.e., moment about zero) of a
distribution Y (x) is defined by
m′k = 〈xk, 〉
where
〈f(x)〉 =
∑
f(x)Y (x), discrete distribution
=
∫
f(x)Y (x)dx,continuous distribution.
m′1, the mean is usually simply denoted as µ = m1. If the
moment is instead taken about a point α, then
mk(α) = 〈(x − α)k〉
=
∑
(x− α)kY (x).
The statistical moments are most commonly taken about the
mean.These so-called central moments and are denoted as mk
and are defined by
mk = 〈(x − µ)k〉
=
∫
(x− µ)nY (x)dx.
B. AWE-type Statistical Moment Matching
Due to the different definition of moment definition, we
now define the statistical moment matching (SMM) method.
SMM is almost the same as the AWE method [9] except that
moment definitions are different and the target function is
usually probability density function (PDF). Thus, it is required
that PDF is always positive and the total area below PDF is
equal to one.
Given a PDF y(t), we can obtain its Laplace transform
Y (s) =
∫
∞
0
y (t) e−stdt. Expanding e−st about s = 0 to
yield
Y (s) =
∫
∞
0
y (t)
[
1− st+ 1

s2t2 − 1

]
=

sk
∫
∞
0
tky (t) dt
=
∞∑
k=0
(−1)k
k!
skm′k. (1)
We can see the statistical moment definition is different than
the AWE method by a division of a factorial, mawek =
m′k/k!. To obtain an approximation of Y (s), we utilize Padeˇ
approximation as follows:
Y¯ (s) =
1 + a1s+ a2s
2 + . . .+ ans
n
1 + b1s+ b2s2 + . . .+ bmsm
, (2)
where m and n are positive integers.
We now use 3rd approximation to illustrate the SMM
process. Comparing these two equations (2) and (1) and
considering a 3rd order approximation, i.e., m = 3 and n ≤ 2,
we obtain the following equation:

 m
′
0 −m′1 12!m′2
−m′1 12!m′2 − 13!m′3

.
Once the b′js are obtained, we commutate al by the follow-
ing equations:
1 = m′0
a1 = m
′
0b1 −m′1
a2 = m
′
0b2 −m′1b1 +

Finally, using a′s and b′s, we can represent the approxi-
mated PDF in terms of exponentials,
y (t) ≈ k1ep1t + k2ep2t + k3ep3t. (4)
Issues of AWE type SMM:
There are several issues of SMM besides the traditional AWE
methods such as stability issues. One of the problem is about
the initial condition issues. AWE methods are traditionally
assume zero initial condition. However, as a matter of fact,
AWE can not guarantee zero initial condition. As a result, the
resulting function may have big errors in the starting point. We
now illustrate a failure example of using AWE to approximate
a 3− sigma shifted Gaussian approximation in the following
figure. It clearly shows that the whole curve is deviated from
the shifted Gaussian a lot.

C. Quadratic Gaussian Polynomial (QGP)
To facilitate SSTA, [2], [10], [11] propose the following
canonical timing model for a given delay function D:
D = µ+ αR+
∑
i
βiYi,
where Y ′i s are parameter distributions. To model the non-
linearity of the delay dependency to Y ′i s, the authors in [7]
proposed to add quadratic terms to the above linear canonical
form as follows:
D = m+ αR +
∑
i
βiYi +
∑
i,j
γijYiYj . (5)
Both canonical and quadratic time model assume parameter
variations to be Gaussian distributions which are not always
applicable in practice. In the cases when a parameter variation,
Y, can not be properly modeled by a simple Gaussian, [7]
B. Complex Quadratic Gaussian Polynomials (CQGP)
The key to derive a more robust modeling approach is to
allow a − c to take complex values. When complex numbers
are allow, the 3 moment equations all can be simultaneously
satisfied. We now present our new complex quadratic Gaussian
polynomial (CQGP) form as follows:
Y = aX2 + bX + c, (CQGP ) (11)
where a, b, and c are complex numbers. We have the following
theorem to show the effectiveness of the CQGP representation.
Theorem 1: Given any distribution Y , the complex
quadratic Gaussian polynomial (CQGP) form can always
match the first three moments of Y .
As a matter of fact, to satisfy those moment equations when
the skew condition is violated, a must be a real number while
b must be an imaginary number. We now prove this theorem
as follows:
Theorem 2: When condition (10) is violated, a and c must
be real while b is an imaginary number.
proof: From equation (8), we know that 2a2 = m2 − b2.
Substituting into equation (9), we get a = m3/(5b2 + 4m2).
Therefore, no matter what value b will take, a must be real.
Also, from b = ±√m2 − 2a2, we know that when a is real,
b must take imaginary values.
Furthermore, although CQGP allows complex coefficients,
the moments of CQGP are still real. So, the moment based
statistical timing operations still can be applied without mod-
ification! So, we can still handle operations such as Add and
Max operations. Furthermore, the correlations in between can
also be easily preserved by the following theorem which is
similar to [7]. Following the approach in [7], we get:
Theorem 3:Assuming CQGP Y1 = a1X21 + b1X1 + c1
and Y2 = a2X22 + b2X2 + c2 are timing parameters in
gates 1 and 2 and assuming X1 and X2 are computational
Gaussian random variables at those gates. ρx is the correlation
coefficient between X1 and X2 and is equal to cov (X1, X2).
Then
cov (Y1, Y2) = ρxb1b2 + 2ρ
2
xa1a2 (12)
The process to prove this theorem does not depend on b1
and b2 if they are complex numbers or not. Because b is a pure
image number, the result for b1b2 is just a real number. This
theorem still useful when we get a complex number solution.
After knowing the covariance between Y1 and Y2, as we
estimated from the measurement data, we are able to solve
the correlation coefficient between X1 and X2 which can
be used in statistical timing analysis. Therefore, we can
construct a covariance matrix - S and Sij denotes cov (Yi, Yj).
Furthermore, we can do eigen value decomposition to S.
Let λ1, λ2, · · · , λp are eigenvalues and e1, e2, · · · , ep are
eigenvectors of S. The solid ellipsoid of X value is satisfying(
X − X¯)′ S−1 (X − X¯) ≤ χ2p (α) has 1− α probability and
X¯ the center, the direction and the length of major axes are
e1 to ep and
√
χ2p (α) ∗ λ1 to
√
χ2p (α) ∗ λp, respectively. Any
observation out of the ellipse can treat as an outlier.
Figure 6 shows two high skewness and Kurtosis examples
which CQGP can not be modeled very accurate. So, we need
CCGP to handle this situation.

C. Complex Cubic Gaussian Polynomial (CCGP)
CQGP matches any distribution up to the 3 moments- mean,
variance, skewness. Sometimes, in the case when the fourth
moment, Kurtosis, is needed, we propose to use complex cubic
Gaussian polynomials (CCGP).
Y = aX3 + bX2 + cX + d, (13)
where a, b, c, and d are complex numbers. Following the
moment definitions, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 4: Given the first 4 moments m1 − m4 of any
distribution, a CCGP Y = aX3 + bX2 + cX + d will match
those four moments if and only if a−d satisfies the following
equations:
m1 = b+ d (14)
m2 = 15a
2 + 6ac+ 2b2 + c2 (15)
m3 = 300ba
2 + 24abc+ 15a (−2ba+ 2bc) + 12b (2ca+ b2)

Proof: Following the definition of Gaussian distribution, we
can compute its moments as follows:
E {X} = 0, E {X2} = 1, E {X3} = 0,
E
{

}

}
= 945, E
{

}
= 0, E
{

}
= 10425
where the quadratic parameters are computed as:
mZ = mX +mY ; αZ = αX + αY (19)
βZ = βX + βY ; γZ = γX + γY (20)
B. MAX Operation
MAX operator, however, is more complicated since it is
generally a non-linear operator and error will hapen if we
approximate it with a linear one. Fortunately, we can borrow
the idea from [13]. Since we can use the methods proposed
in [13] to estimate the first three moments - mean, variance
and skewness, we can pass these moments to equation (6) and
then complete the MAX operation.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULT
We will use our CQGP and CCGP methods to model various
distributions such as uniform distribution. Although some of
them look like a bell shape or even Gaussian distribution, they
are actually faraway from being Gaussian. One way to check
whether a distribution is close to Gaussian distribution is the
Q-Q plot. Q-Q plot is a scheme that finds the correlation
between ordered observations and standard quantiles then
it tests the normality of the observation. If the correlation
coefficients are approximate to 1, the observation is near to
Gaussian distribution.
Figure 9 is a Q-Q plot to test 100000 observations. We
observe that they can not form a straight line and thus they
are not close to a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, using a
linear Gaussian model will not be accurate. In this case,
CQGP or CCGP should be applied. Figure 10 shows the
result of using CQGP which achieves a very accurate result.
Furthermore, CCGP could get a better fit. Figure 11 shows
the two comparisons in detail. Since CCGP can match the
Kurtosis, so it can model the distribution peak more accurately
than CQGP.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose several new process data modeling
method using complex high order Gaussian polynomials such
as CQGP, CCGP, and CHGP. Complex coefficient allows much
more freedom during moment match while is compatible with
main stream SSTA method. Furthermore, we also develop a
Modified Statistical Moment Match method to match the initial
condition. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
correctness of our method.
