We develop an ECG amplifier with gain 100 and low pass filter within 40 Hz.
The A/D converter is made by the MSP430F449 IC, produced by TI instruments. This
IC has a low power requirement and compatible with 8 channel analog input. Four
AAA cell can provide the system power efficiently. This property can make the
system smaller and being portable. The MSP430 sampling frequency is 200 Hz.
(2) Bluetooth ECG transmission:
There are several wireless transmission methods, such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, RF,
and WiFi. The Bluetooth transmission rate is 2.1 Mbps, operated on 2.4GHz,
transmission range from 10 cm to 100 meter. We choose Bluetooth due to its short
distance, high transmission capacity, and higher security concern. Low power
requirement is also a major factor. All such Bluetooth properties are good for
home-based ECG transmission.
We adopt the Bluetooth module from J3 Company [5], and combined with
MSP430 chip and ECG amplifier within an IC board. Bluetooth transmit ECG signal
to the host computer.
(3) Host PC monitoring interface and remote monitoring:
The ECG monitoring interface is programmed by Labview. We also program a
remote monitoring interface beside the host computer that is also coded by Labview.

Another user interface implemented by Labview and used for OSA estimation, is
also constructed. Patients can upload their sleep ECG into the system, and less than
one min later, the interface will give different color light for different sleep
performance. If the patient had a bad sleep, the red light will turn on to notice the
patient takes a further examination in the hospital. The analysis result is also
connected to the hospital database, and the doctor can trace the patientâ€™s OSA
treatment performance immediately.
DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a system contains one-lead ECG, which can be
transmitted wireless by Bluetooth system. The host computer contain signal
demonstration and user interface. HRV sub-band power based OSA identification
algorithm is also implemented in the system.
This system is based on the whole night ECG to estimate the OSA. Traditional R
wave detection algorithm developed on Tompkins is very useful in this study. The
major goal of this study is to develop homecare oriented sleep monitoring system, and
ECG is chosen due to its vital sign characteristics. Low cost, low power demand, easy
to setup and friendly user interface are all major factor to be considered. Such system
is especially useful for the primary screen on OSA candidate and for further traces
after OSA treatment.
Bluetooth combined with MSP430 is especially useful to meet the biomedical
instrumentation requirement. Low power, portable, high transmission capacity, high
security, and practical transmission range is the major advantages. The OSA
identification algorithm proposed in this paper can also used with conventional CPAP
system to monitor the sleep performance of OSA patients.
This system takes the advantages of the wireless and internet, doctors and
