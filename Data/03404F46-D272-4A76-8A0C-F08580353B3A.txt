英文摘要 
Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) 
has attracted enormous attention in recent years, 
as the continuous scaling becomes technically 
difficult and expensive. 3D IC is a promising 
way to further improving IC technology, as it 
provides many advantages, including lower cost, 
low power, alleviating 2D communication 
bottleneck and make possible the integration of 
heterogeneous devices and systems. 
Many interconnect methods have been 
developed for 3D connection, in which the 
Through-Silicon Via (TSV) technology provides 
the most promising cost and performance 
perspective. To make TSV based 3D ICs widely 
available, there are still all kinds of technical 
issues to be solved, including process technology, 
manufacturing, thermal, applications, design, 
EDA, and test. Tools and methodologies for 3D 
IC testing are regarded as the “No.1 challenge” 
among all EDA challenges for 3D IC design. 
Many problems exist, yet no solutions are 
available now. 
In order to reduce the final cost of the 3D 
ICs, dies have to be tested (i.e., known-good die, 
KGD) before they are assembled. However, 
testing TSVs in pre-bonding wafers is difficult. 
Test solutions developed for 2D chips may or 
may not be applicable to 3D IC directly. In this 
research project, we have studied test problems 
that are new in 3D IC, and look for ways to solve 
such problems. 
 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) 
has been proposed for more than two decades. 
However, this technology generated little 
interests in the past, as Moore’s law has been the 
most effective way to increase chip density and 
circuit performance. With the continuous scaling 
becomes technically difficult and expensive, 3D 
IC provides a promising way to further 
improving IC technology. 3D-IC has generated 
interests in recent years. In addition to the cost 
factor, 3D-ICs offer other advantages, including 
alleviating communication bottleneck and make 
The main difference between the proposed 
method and normal scan test architecture is that 
the primary input vectors also have to be loaded 
through scan shift operations. As a result, there 
are only two types of acceptable primary input 
vectors in a delay test: (1) p1 = p2, and (2) p2 is a 
1-bit shift of p1. In the second case, p2 is 
obtained in the same ways as LOS test; therefore, 
the proposed test method is actually a hybrid 
version of LOC and LOS test. 
In an LOS test, the scan chains have to be 
switched from shift mode to capture mode in the 
capture cycle, which requires the scan enable 
(SE) signal to change state within a system clock 
cycle. As a result, the global SE signal has to be 
specially treated to achieve this goal. Fortunately, 
in the proposed hybrid test scheme it is not 
necessary to flip SE in a system clock cycle. The 
reason is that PI chain does not capture response 
in the test process, so it is kept in the shift mode 
during a test. In contrast, PO chain is kept in the 
capture mode during test, which implies SE 
signal in the PO chain is also fixed in the test 
process. Therefore, the hardware overhead of the 
hybrid scheme is close to LOC test even though 
LOS operations are used in the PI chain. 
 
IR-Drop Aware Test Scheme: The amount of 
power consumed in the launch cycle is roughly 
proportional to the number scan flip-flops that 
change states in the launch cycle. In order to 
reduce power consumption, we need to reduce 
the Hamming distance between the two test 
vectors V1=p1s1 and V2=p2s2. In the proposed 
method, we shall try to reduce the Hamming 
distance between state vectors s1 and s2 by 
modifying the architecture of internal scan 
chains. The internal scan chains are divided into 
several groups whose clocks can be gated 
individually. Scan flip-flops will capture circuit 
responses in the launch and capture cycles only 
if their clocks are enabled in the test process. 
The scenario is shown in Fig. 2, where 
shadowed blocks indicating scan flip-flops 
whose clocks are disabled in the test process. 
This modified scan test architecture provides two 
advantages over the traditional method: (1) test 
power can be reduced as the Hamming distance 
between s1 and s2 is decreased, and (2) more 
possible two-pattern tests can be applied, as s2 is 
not necessarily the captured response of applying 
V1 in this case. It is assumed that the disabled 
scan chains will not capture response in launch 
and capture cycles so that the clocks do not have 
to be enabled within a single clock cycle. 
Therefore, errors must be propagated to either 
the PO chain or the same group of scan flip-flops 
to be observable, as shown in Fig. 2. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Scan chain clock gating. 
Fig. 3 shows the circuit implementation of 
the proposed clock gating scheme where the 
internal scan chains are divided into four groups. 
Each partition may contain one or more scan 
chains; for simplicity, it is assumed that each 
partition consists of a single scan chain in Fig. 3. 
The proposed scheme introduces an extra 
Decision Chain that contains control signals for 
clock gating. The clock signal of a partition is 
disabled in a test only if SE is not asserted and 
the corresponding control signal is 0. In the 
example shown in Fig. 3, only Chain 2 is 
enabled in the test. The control signals are 
scanned into Decision Chain through DI port.

Low-Power Pre-bond Test: We have carried out 
experiments on the proposed low-power test 
scheme with benchmark circuits from ISCAS’89 
and ITC’99 suites. Statistics of the circuits are 
given in TABLE I, where the numbers of gates, 
primary inputs, primary outputs, and flip-flops 
are shown.

The transition fault model is used in our 
experiment. The effects of adding PI and PO 
chains are shown in TABLE II. In this 
experiment, two circuits are realized for each 
benchmark: one has PI & PO chains and the 
other has none. LOC test patterns are generated 
by TetraMax; the results, including the number 
of test pattern (#TP) and fault coverage (FC), are 
provided in the table. Columns two and three are 
results for transitional approach (i.e., without PI 
and PO chains), while columns four and five 
show results of circuits with PI and PO chains. 
The last two columns compare these two 
architectures. The results show that, on the 
average, the coverage is decreased by 2.44% 
while the pattern count increased by 1.08%. The 
fault coverage is lower because the 
controllability of PI vectors is significantly 
reduced due to the test pad constraint in 
pre-bond test. 
TABLE III evaluates the effectiveness of 
the proposed in terms of the Hamming distance 
(HD) between initialization vector (V1) and 
activation vector (V2). Columns two and three 
give the maximum HD and average HD in each 
circuit assuming no clock gating is available, 
while columns four and five show the maximum

Abstract—High temperature in test process may invalidate a 
test due to extra delay, or even damage the circuit under test. 
Therefore, a thermal-safe test can avoid undesirable yield loss 
due to the extra delay induced by high temperature. 
Traditional high level test synthesis approaches just improve 
hierarchical testability of circuits and minimize test application 
time. If the thermal effects are ignored, the higher test power 
density may produce unacceptable high temperature even 
though thermal management is carried out in the functional 
mode. Since the thermal-aware design cannot achieve thermal-
safe hierarchical testing, a thermal-safe high level test synthesis 
approach is proposed in this paper to deal with this problem. 
In the proposed test synthesis procedure, the given 
temperature constraints will be satisfied in the test 
environment construction process. Experimental results show 
that the proposed test synthesis method can provide thermal-
safe hierarchical test and shorten test application time 
compared to conventional high-level test synthesis approaches.

testing 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Decreasing feature size and increasing clock speed make 
it possible to manufacture VLSI circuits with high transistor 
density and power consumption. When the power density, 
power dissipation per unit area, is higher, it will lead to the 
higher temperature. The problem with high working 
temperature is that it reduces carrier mobility and threshold 
voltage; thus, it has a significant impact on circuit 
performance. In addition to performance degradation, very 
high temperature also affects circuit reliability. A region with 
excessive heat is referred to as a hot spot. Hot spots may 
cause transient and/or permanent faults, which lead to 
incorrect operations. 
The temperature issue has been taken into account in the 
design process recently [1-7]. In [1], [2], thermal issues are 
considered in floorplanning. Another approach is to adjust 
either voltage or frequency for thermal management [3], [4]. 
Thermal-aware high level synthesis (HLS) approaches are 
targeted in [5-7]. 
In order to reduce test time, parallel test sessions are 
often conducted, which creates higher power density than 
that in the normal operations. Therefore, temperature effects 
can no longer be ignored in test process. The high 
temperature under test may affect the circuit performance 
and poses a serious challenge to delay test. A circuit may be 
identified as faulty when it is tested at a very high 
temperature, but it is good at normal working temperature. 
Two papers targeting thermal-safe test scheduling were 
proposed for system-on-chips (SOC) [8] and network-on-
chips (NOC) [9]. A test scheduling scheme within a 
temperature range was proposed in [10]. The correlation 
between thermal and clock delay is analyzed for delay-fault 
test [11]. A test vector ordering method for scan-based 
testing under peak temperature constraint was proposed in 
[12]. 
Hierarchical testing [13] tries to find a path that provides 
the capability of propagating pre-computed test patterns from 
primary inputs to inputs of the module under test and 
observing module responses at primary outputs. This path is 
also referred as a test environment (TE) [14]. Hierarchical 
testing can be applied to larger designs to speed up test 
generation and as it treats the test problem in the higher level 
of designs. Besides, since it is applied at normal speed, this 
method can carry out delay test without the support of 
special test architecture. Many papers have targeted 
hierarchical testability improvement by register transfer level 
test synthesis (RTLTS) or high level test synthesis (HLTS) 
[14-20]. 
The problem of thermal-safe hierarchical testing is not 
equivalent to the thermal-safe test scheduling [8-10]. In the 
test scheduling problem, modules can be tested separately 
and only modules under test will consume power; therefore it 
is enough to consider the temperatures in the modules that 
are under test. In contrast, in addition to the module under 
test and its TE, other modules not belonging to the TE may 
also be active under hierarchical testing and they will also 
affect the temperature distribution in the test process. A 
detailed discussion on this effect will be presented in section 
3. Traditional test synthesis approaches [14-20] tend to 
activate more modules simultaneously within a few cycles, 
which create high power density and thus lead to high 
temperature in the test process. Please note existing thermal-
aware HLS approaches [5-7] cannot solve this problem, as 
the power density in hierarchical testing is different the one 
in normal operations. 
A new HLTS approach targeted for thermal-safe 
hierarchical testing is proposed in this paper. The major goal 
is to achieve a thermal-safe hierarchical testing. In addition, 
a simplified heat transfer model based on [21] is developed 
to replace the accurate but slower thermal simulator, HotSpot 
[22], in the synthesis process.

observed in CS 3. However, since modules M1, M2, M3, 
and A3 (dotted rectangles) are fed by the same set of inputs 
in the same control steps CS1 and CS2, they will also be 
active at the same time. 
 
 
Figure 2.  HTMs in SDFG ewf 
The possible thermal runaway problem in hierarchical 
testing is illustrated through the following experiment. The 
peak temperature is estimated by HotSpot [22], and a B*-tree 
based floorplaner [23] is used for physical synthesis. Assume 
that the given temperature constraint is 85°C. Experimental 
results show that, even though thermal-aware binding 
schemes [5], [6] are helpful to reduce peak temperature in 
the functional mode to 69.5°C, five out of the six modules 
under test will violate this temperature constraint. 
The example shown in Fig. 3 is a partial SDFG of the 
circuit wavelet and it is targeted for stuck-at-fault testability 
[14]. In this case, clustered HTMs are distributed in CS 1 and 
CS 2. Although the design is thermally safe (peak 
temperature: 71.1°C) in the normal operations, the 
overheating problem still occurs while hierarchical testing is 
executed. 
 
Figure 3.  HTMs in SDFG wavelet 
Two conclusions can be drawn from the above examples: 
(1) a thermal-safe design cannot guarantee a thermal-safe 
hierarchical testing, and (2) clustered HTMs created by 
previous HLTS approaches are the source of high 
temperature in hierarchical testing. 
IV. THERMAL MODEL 
HotSpot [22] can be used to estimate temperature 
accurately; however, it is also time-consuming. Since 
normally there are many candidates available for HTM 
creation, it is necessary to execute HotSpot repeatedly to 
determine the optimal HTMs, which may lead to excessive 
CPU time. Besides, HotSpot requires a floorplan and a 
power tracing file as its inputs. Additional CPU time is 
required to generate these input files. In order to facilitate the 
procedure, a one-dimensional heat transfer model based on 
[21] is used for temperature estimation in the proposed 
HLTS.

The chip temperature can be estimated by using (1) [21], 
where Ta is the ambient temperature, P is the total power 
dissipation, and A is the chip area. Rn denotes the thermal 
resistance (including substrate layer and package) and it is 
found to be 4.75cm2°C/W at T = 120°C for the 180nm 
technology. To simplify the notations, let PD denote the 
power density (i.e. P/A); therefore (1) can be rewritten as (2).

To validate the above thermal model, an experiment is 
carried out as follows. The test vehicle is a chip consisting of 
nine multipliers and the peak temperature is computed by 
HotSpot. The HotSpot parameters are given in Table I. The 
area of heat sink is set to the same as the chip area. Assume 
that this chip is always active while PD is set from 0 to 1000 
KW/m2 with an interval 20 KW/m2. The relationship 
between peak temperature and power density PD is plotted 
in Fig. 4 and these data points can be fitted by the first-order 
polynomial equation shown in (3), where the equivalent 
thermal resistance Rn is 8.066×10-5 m2°C /W.

higher priority. The goal of criterion (1) is to reduce test 
time, while the rationale of criterion (2) is that is module 
with higher power density is more likely to cause trouble and

Figure 6.  Proposed method 
An HTM with higher priority is assigned to a module that 
is not yet hierarchically testable (lines 7-9). After thermal-
aware binding [5] being carried out, the peak temperatures in 
hierarchical testing and in normal operation are estimated by 
(3). If the peak temperature is higher than Temp, this HTM 
candidate will not be accepted (line 13). If module m is 
hierarchical testable and it can be tested along with some 
other modules at the same time, the proposed method will 
test them in parallel (line 14). Two conditions have to be 
satisfied for parallel hierarchical test. (1) The temperature 
constraint is still met when parallel testing is applied, and (2) 
the modules tested in parallel do not have architectural 
conflicts. Architectural conflicts between modules indicate 
that either the test patterns cannot be delivered to modules 
under test simultaneously or the responses cannot be 
observed at the same time. For example, assume that the 
same primary inputs are used in one HTM of an adder and 
another HTM of a multiplier. These two modules cannot be 
tested in parallel since test patterns of the adder and 
multiplier are different and they cannot be delivered to the 
two modules at the same time through the same primary 
inputs. Once every module has its own HTM, the final RTL 
circuit and the controller will be generated (line 17-18). In 
addition, hierarchical test patterns will be generated as well 
(line 19). 
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In our experiments, we only focus on HLTS for delay-
fault testability. However, the proposed method is 
independent of the HTM construction. Other HLTS schemes 
for hierarchical testability can also be used in the proposed 
method. Nine popular computation intensive benchmarks are 
used in the experiment. The temperature constraint is 85°C. 
Table III shows the number of modules that violates the 
given temperature constraint. In this experiment, unused 
inputs in a test session are assigned 0’s. In this way, power 
density will be reduced in the test mode, which may reduce 
the number of modules that violate temperature constraint. 
The proposed method is compared with the HLTS 
method presented in [20], where a thermal-aware binding 
algorithm [5] is used for resource binding. Column three 
(Tpeak,normal) gives peak temperatures under normal operation 
in circuits synthesized by [20], and in every case the 
temperature constraint is satisfied. However, since thermal 
effects in hierarchical testing are not considered, clustered 
HTMs will cause high power density. Column four (Tpeak,test) 
gives peak temperatures in hierarchical testing, and the 
number of modules that violates the temperature constraint is 
given in column five. Out of the nine benchmark circuits, 
only two can achieve 100% thermal-safe hierarchical testing. 
In contrast, the proposed HLTS approach considers thermal 
issues during HTM creation, and thus all synthesized circuits 
can achieve 100% thermal-safe hierarchical testing, as 
shown in column eight.

The area of registers and modules is required for the B*-
tree based floorplanner [23]. This physical information can 
be obtained by Cadence SOC Encounter with UMC 0.18 μm 
technology. Table IV shows chip areas of the data-path 
circuits. The circuit sizes are comparable in most cases. 
Table V compares the total test application time of serial 
module testing [20] versus the proposed parallel method 
(Proposed). The last column shows the speedup due to 
parallel testing, and it can be seen that about 10.53% to
