Abstract 
To extend the physical property limits of carbon nanotube fibers spun under current 
technique, silk protein solution are proposed to as a carrier to enhance the nanodispersion of 
carbon nanotube and the toughness of this nanocomposite fibers.  In this study, the silk fibers 
collected from Taiwan’s native Bombxy mori and the single wall carbon nanotubes will be 
utilized.  Carbon nanotubes and silk protein solution will be dissolved in a common solvent.  
The phase behaviors and stability of silk protein/carbon nanotubes solutions will be examined by 
polarized optical microscope (POM).  Then the carbon silk protein/nanotubes solution will be 
turn into films and fibers by solution cast and electrospinning, respectively.  The mechanical 
properties of carbon nanotubes/silk protein fibers will be measured.  The secondary structure 
and wettabilty of nanofiber webs will be investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and 
contact angle analyzer to define the influence of electric field.  It sheds some light on the 
process-structure-property relationship on carbon nanotubes/silk protein nanocomposites.

Procedures Specifics
Clean foreign 
matter 
The cocoons have been cut open, had the 
pupae removed, and been picked clean of 
foreign matter. 
Degum thoroughly Purified silk fibroin was prepared by 
boiling deionized water with Na2CO3 to 
degum. After degummed silk fibroin 
soaked in methanol and dried in the room 
temperature.   
Dissolution The silk fibroin was dissolving by certain 
high ionic strength aqueous salt solution. 
The mixture became a clear, viscous, pale 
amber solution. 
Dialysis The solution of silk fibroin in certain high 
ionic strength aqueous salt was filtered 
through a stack of stainless steel screens 
mesh, and dialyzed to water until solvent 
was replaced with deionized water. 
Regeneration  
silk fibroin
The resulting solution of silk fibroin in 
water was nearly clear and quite 
free-flowinng.
