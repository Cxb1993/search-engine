requirements may be 
concentrated on some conflicting performance either 
on car or airplane. 
The design efforts become interesting and 
challenging. To this complicate system design, this 
work focuses on the flying vehicle design 
consideration for the ＇Aero Runner＇.

Aero Runner Preliminary Design on Aero Performance 
ABSTRACT： This report is about how to redesign a gyroplane into a 
car obtaining car’s maneuverability and fly ability. The main concept 
includes the stress analysis for folder system of main rotor. For the 
structure simplicity, gyroplane is our target obtaining a better Aero 
Runner shape for aerodynamics. The lift simulations are also 
accomplished in Fluent environment. In the results, the Aero Runner is 
redesigned from a gyroplane which can take off within a short distance. 
This will greatly helpful for some particular purposes under regulations. 
The Aero Runner will accomplish its application capability in special 
demands.

mission of the airplane.  But all modern airplanes have certain 
components in common. They are fuselage, wing, tail assembly and 
control surfaces, landing gear, and power systems. 
   In order to keep the airplane airborne, the airplane needs 
sufficient lift in the air continuously. The lift is generated mostly by 
wings to keep the plane in the air. But to initiate and sustain this left, the 
airplane must be pushed forward. This is the function of the engine 
system. The engine is located beneath the wings and provides the thrust 
to push the airplane run forward.  When the airplane gets true air speed 
to generate lift force from the wings, it takes off into the air. 
 The fuselage is like the skeleton or body of the airplane that 
holds all pieces together. Engineers try to make the whole model as 
smooth as possible. This is one of the solutions to reduce surface drag. 
The fuselage also includes the cockpit for pilots and flight crew.  Plane 
fuel can be either carried in fuselage or wings.  Engines may also be 
incorporated in the fuselage. The power system consists of the engine as 
well as any other related components for thrust, such as propellers. The 
engines are usually found in pods beneath the wings or (especially in 
fighter planes) in the fuselage.  
 
1.2 Helicopter & Gyroplane 
Helicopters and airplanes have some major components in common. 
These components include a cabin where the payload and crew are 
carried; an airframe, which houses the various components, or where 
components are attached; a power system; and a transmission, which, 
1‐6 
 
control, which have since become essential elements of most 
conventional helicopters.  
An important advancement was made in 1931, introducing the 
concept of cyclic pitch variation as a means of rotor control. This proved 
to be the last major contribution of gyroplanes to the rotorcraft field. The 
early thrive in gyroplane development was undermined by the production 
of the first helicopters in the early 1930s and the death of Cierva in 1936. 
Although they were briefly used as aerial observation posts in WW 
II, interest in the airplane waned until 1953, when the Bensen Gyrocopter 
was invented. This two-bladed rotorcraft used a teetering hub bar and 
rotor head to support its main rotor. It was concluded that the climbing 
performance, the payload availability, and the minimum-level-flight 
speed characteristics of the Bensen were considerably better than those of 
the fixed wing airplane. The Bensen was also the first gyroplane to 
become widely commercially available and introduced the idea of using 
this type of airplane for recreational flying purposes. [3]  
Some definition will be constructed by corporations. According to 
the Carter Aviation, they specify three types of rotorcraft that utilizes a 
rotor blade to provide lift for distinctions. [2]:  
(a) The helicopter, in which the rotor blade provides vertical thrust and, 
because the rotor disc can be tilted on a supporting and rotating 
vertical mast, a horizontal thrust component.  
(b) The auto-gyroplane, in which lift is provided by a rotary wing and 
forward thrust provided by a propeller. Autorotation is achieved by 
tilting the rotor disc back relative to the airflow so that some air 
1‐8 
 
main rotor and low aspect ratio wings. Vertical takeoff and landing are 
achievable through powering of the two bladed main rotors, which is 
switched to autorotation mode once the airplane is airborne. The airplane 
is projected to cruise at a speed of 400 mph at 45,000 ft height, achieving 
a range of 2,500 miles. 
The Super Sky Cycle by Butterfly LLC from Oklahoma is reported. 
The Super Sky Cycle is a cross between a gyroplane with folding rotor 
blades and a lightweight, three-wheeled motorcycle. Butterfly's president 
said that it can be driven on the road, parked in the family garage, and 
flied through the air. The Super Sky Cycle powered by Rotax 912ULS 
100-hp four-stroke engine which can allow 55 mph in the Highway Speed 
and a top speed in excess of 100 mph in the flight. 
"The problem with flying cars in the past was what to do with the 
wings once we were on the ground," said Neal. "With a "fly-drive 
gyroplane", just fold the rotor blades and drive on down the road." 
"Using rotor blades for the wings of a flying car makes the fly-drive 
Super Sky Cycle a new kind of vehicle." Neal said. "There’s nothing else 
like it, a gyroplane that can fly at freeway speeds, land in 20 feet, be 
driven home as a motorcycle, and fit in your garage." 
The representative one using the combination of car and airplane is 
the “Transition”. The “Transition” combines both the unique convenience 
of being able to fold its wing and the ability to drive on any pavement in a 
modern personal airplane platform. Stowing the wings for road use and 
deploying them for flight at the airport is activated from inside the 
cockpit.

catastrophe is encountered, it’s hard to find a perfect runway into the 
disaster area. The above mentioned incidents can be solved easily by the 
maneuver ability of the Aero Runner. As the time goes by, many 
corporations invented some kind of product which satisfies the demand. 
Despite the most of modern designs are using the car as the model, 
transforms the car into airplane. The above mentioned issues will lead to 
lack of aerodynamics and waste of energy. In this work, a gyroplane is 
proposed as a model to get better aerodynamics for either a car or an 
airplane in performance.  Investigations of hub bar and rotor may also 
be analyzed through the FEA software. At the same time, the safety can 
be guaranteed with the superb flight properties.  In this study, the main 
rotor is important to consider a folder system to reduce the overall length. 
If the size of the main rotor can be reduced, the size of Aero Runner is 
also minimized.  It’s an efficient way to broaden the usable area where 
the Aero Runner can take off.  The systems on Aero Runner will give a 
reliable performance and make convenient transport.  Some problems 
such as the main rotor efficiency will be discussed in this work.  
 
1.5 Regulations 
In the domestic area, all airplanes are regulated by CAA laws and 
regulations [7, 8]. A general category of definition can be found to fit for 
gyroplanes. Also on the automotive, there are general regulations to 
constrain.  In order to get a further discussion, the relational regulations 
[9] for this study are listed in Table 1-1.

Even though the rotors create less drag than the large wings of low 
speed airplanes, they create more drag than the smaller wings of higher 
speed airplanes. So, auto-gyros create more drag than airplanes of 
comparable size that fly at the same speeds. Also because of this drag, 
auto-gyros are not suitable for high speed flight or long distance flight. 
Model validation can in general be performed by use of one of three 
methods: 
(1) Analytical expressions derived from the theory governing the 
physical principles, 
(2) The aid of wind tunnel experiments,  
(3) Conduct a real airplane flight test. 
Although analytical expressions relating to autorotation have been 
derived since the beginnings of the development of rotor aerodynamic 
theory, they are mainly concerned with rotor performance characteristics. 
On the other hand, sustain a stable state for autorotation in a wind tunnel 
presents a series of difficulties mainly caused by the high rotor rpm that 
the small scale model would have to achieve. 
 
1.7 Advantages 
The main advantages of gyroplane compared with conventional 
airplane will be as follow [6].  
(1) Contrary to fixed wing airplanes it cannot stall so the safety is 
guaranteed.  
(2) In turbulent air it still flies steady as a rock due to its high rotor 
speed.

simulation software or wind tunnel tests.  The FEA software is 
introduced to calculate the stresses in each main parts of gyro rotor 
and engine center.  
From the literatures, a gyroplane will be redesigned by considerations 
into a car. This kind of concept will combine the above configuration. 
The references will bring in a better concept in the future design. 
 
 
2. SIMULATION SOFTWARE 
2.1 Introduction to Finite Element Analysis 
Finite element analysis was first developed in 1943 by R. Courant 
[10], who utilized the Ritz method of numerical analysis and 
minimization of variation calculus to obtain approximate solutions to 
vibration systems. Shortly thereafter, a paper published in 1956 by M. J. 
Turner, R. W. Clough, H. C. Martin, and L. J. Topp established a broader 
definition of numerical analysis [11]. The paper centered on the "stiffness 
and deflection of complex structures". 
By the early 70's, FEA was limited to expensive mainframe 
computers generally owned by the aeronautics, automotive, defense, and 
nuclear industries. Since the rapid decline in the cost of computers and 
the phenomenal increase in computing power, FEA has been developed to 
an incredible precision [10]. Present day supercomputers are now able to 
produce accurate results for all kinds of parameters. A finite element 
model is an abstraction of a more complicated physical system. The 
physical world is invariably too complex to model at every level of detail.  
1‐22 
 
important that even introductory treatments of Mechanics of Materials. 
With this tool, the analysis of any problem types including structural, 
vibrational, fatigue and heat transfer can be accomplished [11]. 
 
2.2 CAD Software 
SolidWorks is easy to learn and to use with its intuitive interface [13]. 
It shows commonly used tools and right commands in menus at the right 
time. This kind of interface gives instantly productive and personalized 
for all users. It may also be used as the wizards or diagnostic tools to 
guide in complex CAD [13]. Using the above mentioned properties, it is 
easy to create a complex model with competitiveness of nowadays. 
In CAD world, 2D and 3D sketching intelligence is the backbone of 
3D modeling. SolidWorks software equips easy-to-understand sketch 
relationships which allow prompt capture the design intent directly in the 
3D CAD model when making changes. Everything of concern will update 
automatically according to any new ideas to test.  If any conflicts arise, 
SolidWorks SketchXpert [13] will evaluate the sketch relationships and 
automatically troubleshoots any issues. This additional intelligence 
ensures that models rebuild correctly during design changes, eliminating 
rework and saving time and money.  
From simple prismatic geometry to the most complex shapes, the 
software is always fast and efficient, automating repetitive tasks that slow 
design and development.  If some complex assemblies are designed, it 
becomes difficult to visualize and understand the interactions and fitment 
of components in the assembly. With the aid of software, all parts can be 
1‐24 
 
design change, investigating the impact on product performance under 
real-world conditions. SolidWorks Simulation is intuitive enough for the 
casual user, yet powerful enough to deliver advanced analysis. 
SolidWorks automatic Costing tool generates estimates of part 
manufacturing costs that adjust whenever a design modification should 
need.  The engineer can easily track costs to ensure the projects stay on 
target to meet profit goals. Designers can make faster, repeatable, and 
more informed design decisions based on cost, and change their designs 
to lower manufacturing cost. The Costing tool’s cost templates are 
customizable, enabling users to enter any specific manufacturing costs 
and data, such as material, labor, machine speed and feeds, and setup 
costs [13]. 
SolidWorks simulation tools can benefit all designers at any stage of 
product development. The analysis capabilities are fully integrated within 
the SolidWorks design environment, sharing familiar workflows, naming 
conventions, and commands. If any designers are not familiar with this 
part of simulation, the easy way to just follow the Simulation advisors 
and wizard and enjoy the fast learning course. The studies in the software 
will record all your settings, including materials, connections, walls 
boundaries, or assembly relationships to increase the efficiency. Also it 
can handle the most designs with a fully-developed tools or analyzing the 
structure, motion, and multi-physics of selected parts and assemblies, or 
exploring fluid dynamics and heat flow around and through your designs.   
Designers can size welds, check bolted connections, and understand 
the forces from complex motion. Besides, when modifying geometry and 
1‐26 
 
or select a slice of your model to reduce calculation time and get the 
technical insight faster than ever. Information can best drive change when 
it is communicated clearly. SolidWorks simulation technology not only 
shows study results graphically, it has unique tools that enable designer to 
focus on key areas and even understand performance trends. Robust 
reporting tools allow different investigations and results with everyone 
involved. The reports detail how studies are set up and the resulting 
conclusions. Design decisions can be made as a group and justified with 
clear documentation. Further, SolidWorks eDrawings software shares 
simulation results with everyone, even those without CAD. The 
eDrawings 3D interface lets customers and suppliers see results 
graphically, from any angle. The information improves customer 
confidence and gives we a competitive advantage in winning business 
[13]. For our Aero Runner design, the model structure is creating in this 
fantastic software. It offers the analysis for stress, displacement, strain 
and also the safety factor in the project. All users can view our research 
through this simulation software output. That’s why we choose this 
software to display our results through powerful images. To persuade 
everyone who is reading this work, it’s a good try and affordable for 
everyone.  
 
2.3 Lift Distribution 
In order to simulate 3D gyro rotor lift distribution through 2D model, 
some introduction for Gambit and Fluent will be required. The 
combination for the CFD software including the functions need for 
1‐28 
 
of physical models; multiple turbulence models are implemented, starting 
with the basic k-epsilon and k-omega models, up to the latest DES and 
LES models. Recent implementations include the k-kl-omega (3eq.) and 
SST k-omega (4eq.) transitional models [14]. A central-differencing 
second-order accurate spatial discretization is used for the diffusive terms, 
while the convective terms are discretized using an optional upwind 
scheme (from first-order up to third-order accurate) for RANS models, or 
a bounded central-differencing scheme for LES. Temporal discretization 
is a first or second-order accurate backward differencing, implicitly or 
explicitly integrated. Gradient reconstruction is accomplished by a 
Green-Gauss cell/node-based or a Least-Squares cell-based algorithm. 
Several numerical solvers are available, pressure or density-based, 
implicit or explicit, steady-state or transient. Convergence acceleration is 
achieved by an Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) for the implicit solvers or a 
Full Approximation Storage Multigrid (FAS) for the explicit solver. 
Computational efficiency is greatly enhanced by the use of a 
highly-scalable parallel processing capability [14]. 
 
2.4 Remark 
The FEA principle is incorporated into this chapter. For our Aero 
Runner design, the model structure is creating in CAD environment and 
need a comprehensive knowhow about software. Gambit and Fluent make 
the lift simulation possible in computer since they deal with all 
pre-processing and post-processing works. SolidWorks simulation makes 
the result of stress, displacement and strain to number and figures. Safety

3. METHODOLOGY 
3.1 Vehicle Dynamics 
3.1.1 Gyroplane Aerodynamics 
According to the FAA handbooks [1], here are some features we need 
to know before further discussion. 
In order to eliminate the unbalanced lift in forward flight, we need 
the advancing blade teeters up, decreasing angle of attack and lift, while 
the retreating blade teeters down, increasing angle of attack and lift, but 
causes a shift in the zones of the rotor disc. 
Higher speed creates a larger region of reverse flow at the same time 
the operating speed of the rotor system also has an effect on the size of 
the region. Lower rpm is more susceptible to reverse flow and allowing a 
greater portion of the blade to experience the effect. 
The retreating blade stall in a gyroplane occurs outboard from the 
rotor hub at the 20 to 40 percent position. We may feel a slight increase in 
vibration, but we would not experience a large pitch or roll tendency 
because it’s not present at the rotor tip.  
The force produced by the gyroplane rotor may be composed of by 
two components; rotor lift and rotor drag. The component of rotor force 
perpendicular to the flight path is rotor lift, and the component of rotor 
force parallel to the flight path is rotor drag.

On a gyroplane with a semi-rigid, teeter-head rotor system, blade flap 
may develop if too much airflow passes through the rotor system while it 
is operating at low rpm. 
The pre-rotators on certificated gyroplanes remove the possibility of 
blade flap during pre-rotation. Before the clutch can be engaged, the pitch 
must be removed from the blades. The rotor is then pre-rotated with a 0° 
angle of attack on the blades, which prevents lift from being produced 
and precludes the possibility of flapping. When the desired rotor speed is 
achieved, blade pitch is increased for takeoff. 
In order to execute short-field takeoff, choosing a powerful 
pre-rotator to spin the rotor with higher rpm, once maximum rotor rpm is 
attained, disengage the rotor drive, release the brakes, and apply power to 
achieve airspeed and rotor rpm. While remaining on the ground, 
accelerate the gyroplane to a speed just prior to Vx. At that point, tilt the 
disk aft and increase the blade pitch to the normal in-flight setting. The 
climb should be at a speed just under Vx until rotor rpm has dropped to 
normal flight rpm, then increasing the airspeed to Vy for as soon as above 
mentioned procedure finish. Try to limit suitable range for pitch attitude, 
as tail contact with the ground prevents high pitch attitudes until in flight 
for proper tail clearance. 
For jump takeoff, the “rule of thumb” being used for this particular 
aircraft stipulates that 1,000 feet of density altitude equates with 10 
M.P.H. wind or 100 pounds of gross weight. 
Set your altimeter to the standard sea level pressure setting of 29.92

3.3 Simulation Environment Preparation 
3.3.1 Experimental Procedure 
This work will be conducted in the following orders. We’ll find some 
concept ideas and designs. The final design will be able to fly well in the 
air; meanwhile, maneuverability is maintained on the ground.  
Collect wide-ranging data for Aero Runner shape designs; meanwhile, 
take into account the regulations involved in aircraft designs.  
To view any fully-developed designs in gyroplane category for our 
preliminary conceptual shape designs. 
Design a foldable mode main rotor for better ground performance 
and aircraft storage.  
Analyze the model we constructed in SolidWorks for stress, strain, 
etc. Considering the feasibility in realization Aero Runner in daily life, 
compare it with the design in market now. 
Some difficulties encountered in this procedure will also be noted as 
follows. 
The combination movement between airborne and ground may lead 
to a balance problem, it will be important to set the center of gravity in 
the right place. We may need to adopt the module concept in each 
assemblies, this will increase the efficiency in balance calculating.  
Main rotor should be foldable in the ground and only use when we’re 
preparing to aloft. Rigidity and stiffness are also important while storage.

We have to choose a metal material for main rotor. In order to resist 
the tensile stress in flight, two kinds of aluminum alloy 6061-T6, 
2024-T3 will be used in simulations. 
After we design our operation height for Aero Runner, we need to 
focus on the environmental conditions for operation. 
It can be seen from the Figure 3-14. The force on the pressure side of the 
rotor was greater than on the suction side, resulting in a pressure 
difference between the two sides of the surface, which eventually led to 
the upward lift. At the same time the lift was greater toward blade tip, this 
phenomenon can be seen from the pressure difference in the comparison 
on the same location. These two results are what we need in real-world 
gyroplane operation [20]. 
If we look at the Figure3-12 carefully, it shows that the pressure 
coefficient of the pressure side of the rotor is hardly influenced by any 
combination of settings, neither by the number of computational grids, 
nor by the size of the time-step, suggesting that when the attack angle was 
set at 8°, little change would be made on the pressure gradient at the 
pressure side of the rotor, consequently, the results obtained from various 
instances of numerical calculation were close to the experimental data. 
By contrast, the pressure coefficient at the suction side of the rotor 
surface underwent a series of significant changes, indicating that when 
the attack angle was set at 8°, significant changes were made on the 
pressure gradient of the suction side of the rotor, leading to computational 
errors. Also, the pressure coefficient was more severely influenced by the 
number of the computational grids and the size of the time-step.

4. SIMULATION AND RESULTS 
 
4.1 2D lift simulations 
In the beginning of this chapter, we need to introduce our simulation 
environment conditions in Table 4-1. In Table 4-2, we specify both the 
upper, bottom, inlet, outlet distances is proportional to chord length of 
airfoil section, which means the bigger the airfoil dimension, we need 
more room to reconstruct the wind tunnel environment conditions. This is 
because we need to minimize the effect of block to the gyro rotor 
performance. We extract the spirit of airfoil modeling tutorial [21] so that 
we can use 2D airfoil to simulate 3D gyro rotor. In the end of this part, we 
should be able to do the next stage in Solidworks design. Figure 4-1 is the 
airfoil parameter used in simulation. Figure 4-2 and Figure 4-3 are the 
display of grid face in Fluent.

 According to the calculations we made, N1~2 shows that the 25% 
near the root doesn’t make a huge contribution to the lift production. The 
same phenomenon occurs in N2~3. If we further incorporate gyroplane 
rotor blade operating regions and empirical experiences from expert [1]. 
In gyroplane autorotation, the combination of stall region and driving 
region will make velocity distribution unbalance phenomena more 
severely. It leads to 2/3 portion of gyro rotor without lift. Since we simply 
simulation environment in many aspects, such as inviscid, angle of attack 
fixed at 6° to obtain N4~5 closely equal to the summation of N1~2 , 
N2~3 and N3~4. In the actual flying conditions for Aero Runner, the stall 
region and driving region effect will increasingly influence the whole 
model to the 2/3 portion without lift, so we assume the outer 1/3 portion 
is the main lift contribution.   
 
4.2 SolidWorks Simulations for model 
We draw our gyro rotor model in SolidWorks working environment

Both the tensile case and compress case show that the model will not 
failure because the left-hand value are smaller compared to the right-hand 
criteria value. This formula tells that the structure and material are still 
good in the simulation operation. As we can see, the displacement for tip 
in 2024-T3 case is 473.6 mm. It’s about 160mm bigger than the 
displacement assumption 313.2mm. The difference may come from the 
simulation lift force from Fluent, since we have ignored the viscous effect. 
On the other hand, use 2D airfoil to simulate 3D rotor must pay 
something back.

Since we’re caring about the rotor tip deflection, the displacement 
along Z axis is most important to us Figure 4-18, the result of 
displacement is shown in Table 4-7.

After the simulations we conducted, we can make a conclusion that 
the 2024-T3 is better for Aero Runner. It shows better quality in both 
stress and displacement than 6061-T6. Less displacement means more 
available strength for resisting the bending moment. We’ll shows the

analyze the lift for 2D airfoil. The main purpose is to divide the gyro 
rotor blade into equal length sections. Since it’s hard to perfectly simulate 
the rotor performance, the 2D method is used for simplicity. After 
adopting this method, lift for any position can be determined. 
So the validation for expert can be guaranteed. That’s the main 
reason why the assumption in the CAD model construction will hold. In 
the SolidWorks environment, gyro rotor model is constructed successfully 
and then simulate through the build-in static analysis. Two common 
materials 2024-T3 and 6061-T6 are compared through the simulations. 
Also the nature bending for gyro rotor in calculated for selected material. 
It gives a good result about stress, displacement and strain between them. 
After the experiment finishing, the interaction between gyro rotor 
parameters are constructed for Aero Runner.

5.2 The Existing Problems 
In the simulation environment, assumptions are made for simplify 
the complexity of model. In order to use this easier model, it must be 
necessary to compromise to the calculate precision. It’s hard to achieve 
both goals at the same time. 
The parameters for Aero Runner are coupled together, many of them 
is not available from references. This is because the value of critical 
design point was profitable to corporation. If we want to realize and 
design a new model, it will be necessary to cooperate with factory. This 
will benefit our work from experience aspect. 
 
5.3 Future Work 
To construct the 3D gyro rotor model in Fluent. This software 
provides good prediction in CFD domain. If we can realize the lift 
distribution better than 2D airfoil simulation, we can use this in the 
SolidWorks simulation to perform better force distribution. It will predict 
our stress, displacement precisely. Maybe another CAE software can be 
incorporated into the simulation, more desirable results will be obtained. 
After verifying the Aero Runner model, this project is feasible and 
reliable to start an engineering job.  It’s time to build this vehicle in real 
world, since Aero Runner combines both aero and ground performance. 
The cost will be high at initial development stage, but it is worthy of a try.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Man dreams for flying that aircraft makes this dream come true from 
the old age two dimensional (2D) motion into three dimensional (3D) 
motions.  Aircraft itself has characteristics to take the advantage of huge 
airspace to fly directly from one point to another.  However, cars and 
aircraft are two independent categories of no cross-relationship.   
An integration of car with aircraft was successfully tested by MIT 
technical group.  Flying car or Aero Runner can become more attractive 
to investigate for more feasible designs by considerations of a car and a 
flying machine.  
On the proposed “Aero Runner”, a new idea for a feasible design of 
flying car is extended from aircraft performance into running vehicle on 
the ground.  To the design issue for “Aero Runner”, which parameters 
are most necessary for both an aircraft and a car, and which parameters 
are conflicting and need to trade-off?  Two primary requirements should 
be considered on its maximum take-off weight (MTOW) and take-off 
runway length (RWL), for the weight refers to function capability and 
runway length releases the constraint to use under limited environment.  
Other secondary requirements may be concentrated on some conflicting 
performance either on car or aircraft.  The design efforts become 
interesting and challenging.  
To this complicate system design, this work focuses on the ground 
vehicle design consideration for the “Aero Runner”.

rotation.  When the gyro rotor rotates upto 300 rpm, its lift becomes 
high enough to sustain the gyroplane take-off weight and to fly.  If the 
engine and propeller fail in the air, the inertia of gyroplane can still 
maintain forward flight for this situation. Besides, the gravity and air 
resistance will gradually reduce speed and altitude at the same time.  
This means a landing process should be continuusly manipulated.  With 
relative airflow, the rotor will be able to rotation continuously to provide 
lift to support the vehicle.  
Although the helicopter is also having rotation along the safe landing 
capability, but when the power transition changes the state from powerful 
to powerless, it will loses some altitude.  If the altitude is not high 
enough, the helicopter might be too slow gaining height and touchdown, 
but gyroplane flight is in the rotation state with less critical crash alert. 
Gyroplane has good enough advantages than helicopter but people 
usually think it is more dangerous than helicopter.  Gyroplane rotor is 
not powered, so it does not have much system vibration and noise by 
power-driven.  Because of the above descriptions, it would not have 
vibration and noise to cause the rotor’s and the airframe’s  material 
fatigue and increase driver’s tiredness. The impact of gyroplane’s 
power-driven apparently is more less than helicopter. 
Gyroplane becomes more widely and more popular in the western 
countries on the main part of sports and leisure purposes.  The 
advantages of the gyroplane are security-increased, easy control, 
outstanding short field taking off and point-to-point flying capability. 
When the road is cutting off on the disaster, gyroplane has the advantages 
2‐7 
 
constraints.  Depending on how the Aero Runner is designed and used 
for, meeting the ULA specification brings good advantages for sport and 
leisure use. ULA needs no certification procedures to simplify design and 
build efforts for Aero Runner development.   
Gyroplanes have already been especially applied in many countries in 
the sky by amateur players, but now no matter what stage of the domestic 
researches or private organizations don’t involve in the study of design 
and developing handbook. Aero Runner takes the advantages of simple 
structure that can save much time on controlling mechanism or pipeline, 
so it is considerable maturity in the design. 
Research project is expecting for the year, the team will perform the 
content into two parts: for the aero part and for the runner part.  The aero 
part discusses the a folding gyro rotor design to reduce overall length, the 
rotor shape and size relating to aerodynamic requirement, flying vehicle 
performance and handling stability.  The runner part discusses design 
consideration for a ground vehicle with modification for a safe and 
accurate power switching between tires and propeller. Aero Runner 
exterior designs and power system arrangements still need to follow the 
ULA regulations, limitations and future prospects.  In academic research, 
it could deeply realize the ways and principles of combining two kind 
vehicles in dynamic features and power system planning.  The Aero 
Runner can be designed into more practical engineering application.  
The legality of the design can be extended for leisure sports and for 
emergency rescue vehicle.

structure and security of the body have a great relationship.  
(3) Power switch: When the Aero Runner is taking off, the gyro rotor 
must be running to maintain a certain speed to provide the necessary 
lift off. When the rear of the engine speed is increasing, the gyro rotor 
speed will increase consequently.  The gyro rotor will rotate into high 
speed to lift off the gyroplane as take-off and fly.   
(4) Vehicle regulations: Aero Runner design must also comply with 
relevant car regulations and CAA regulations for a ground vehicle and 
an ultra-light aircraft.  The Aero Runner must be designed to 
accommodate two types of regulation restrictions; therefore, 
discussion to focus on the statutory provision is also important in this 
study.

computer from the mechanical device and physical geometry parameters 
and using the program to calculate can obtain deformation or stress the 
numerical solution. FEM has been developing for more than forty years 
and now has reached a mature stage. It has become a powerful tool to 
develop an equipment safety assessment. 
Extensive use of finite element method can not only economize on 
the cost of mechanical design but also examine non-destructive test in 
using of machinery and equipment. The test can detect the problem early 
to prevent the accidents or replace materials and equipment in order to 
achieve the objective of factory safety and normal operation. Estimation 
or inspection can not only increase the quantity of output, but also reduce 
the costs to get the maximum profit. 
There are three commonly uses of computer-aided software. The first 
is the Computer-Aided Design (CAD), which uses computer software 
directly to engage in the design of graphics rendering and structure. The 
second is the Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM), which is a direct 
computer assisted machines to manufacture components to manipulate a 
wide range of precision tool. The third one is the Computer-aided 
Engineering (CAE), which is the engineering analysis process and 
calculation methods to assist engineers to do the analysis after the design 
or do the simultaneous engineering. The earliest introduction of 
computer-aided software is the CAD, CAM, and the latest is CAE [1].  
CAE contains a lot of types of technologies, including Finite Element 
Method (FEM), boundary element method (BEM), and finite difference 
method (FDM).  Each method has its application domain, respectively. 
2‐13 
 
systems, and vehicles. Multi-body dynamics of the vehicle includes 
vehicle performance analysis, structural strength, stiffness, modal 
analysis, structural fatigue and reliability analysis, vibration and noise 
analysis, kinetic analysis of structural components, automotive crash 
safety analysis, components analysis of metal forming, thermal structure 
coupled analysis, and fluid dynamics analysis [2]. 
 
2.2.1 Vehicle and parts strength and fatigue analysis 
Strength and fatigue analysis is the traditional vehicle structural 
analysis and the analysis of objects is parts to assembly to vehicle. By 
static or dynamic analysis of the parts, realizing the parts stress 
distribution and make the right parts performance evaluation. Taking 
advantage of by body assembly structure analysis can select and optimize 
body parts to provide design guidance. It can accomplish parts 
optimization, lightweight design and reliability design through analysis of 
chassis or vehicle. 
Automotive product design has entered a limited-life design. In the 
period of warranty, limited-life design requires automotive vehicle and 
parts intact and not fatigue failure out of the warranty period. 
Components should be as much as possible to achieve damage in order to 
lightweight, save material and energy. In the time of concrete structure 
analysis, it has to in accordance with the purpose of analysis and stress 
state of the object analysis to choose the representation of object stress 
indicators and strength indicators of the mechanical properties analysis. 
2‐15 
 
 
2.2.3 Vehicle and parts modals and dynamic analysis 
Modal analysis is the basis of the analysis of structural dynamic 
characteristics. The purpose is to understand and evaluate the relation 
between structures or components that whether the frequency and modal 
shape is reasonable, and provide automatic structure parts for the basis of 
dynamic design. By the method of modal analysis, we can understand the 
structure of each modal feature in a subject frequency range and predict 
the actual influence of structure vibration in this frequency range. 
The evaluation of automotive design is multi-faceted and multi-level. 
From the angle of design, the vehicle structural dynamics has several 
steps: 
(1) Point out the dynamic design and analysis requirements of 
automotive structures. 
(2) Propose the verification requirements of automatic structure test 
and make sure the structural dynamic design principles. 
(3) Proceed to the structural dynamic characteristics and dynamic 
impact analysis. 
(4) Carry vehicle frequency planning out. 
(5) According to frequency control design principles, affect control 
principle, and noise control principle and so on to carry on design 
and optimize. 
(6) To ensure the vehicle in motion control, it can avoid the resonance 
region of the interference frequency is design of analysis by

development. The goal of Collision analysis of automotive simulation is 
to improve the safety of passive performance. Considering the huge test 
expenses of automobile collision, the comprehensive analysis of 
automobile collision develops frontage collision, side collision, rear 
collision, and so on. For the automatic's passive safety performance 
requirements: 
(1) When automatic is colliding body structure, driving system, seats 
can absorb higher energy to ease the impact.  
(2) When the accident was happened, it should guarantee the 
passengers of vehicle existing space, protection of seatbelt, 
airbags and so on which can easy to carry passengers outside and 
rescue danger. 
 
2.2.6 Design optimization analysis 
Optimizing design method combining with FEM can solve every 
optimizing design problem of complex structure. The vehicle structure 
design optimization analysis is generally based on lightweight for the 
target, strength, stiffness, frequency as the constraints and changes the 
design of shapes and sizes to select the optimum program. After 
completing the preliminary optimization, it must use reasonable 
explanation, consider the limit of manufacturing material and make 
further sure of the correctness and feasibility to the result of optimizing 
design.  
 
2‐19 
 
solve the solution [3].  Using of computer-aided engineering analysis 
software (ANSYS Workbench) program to define a problem and analyze 
through the following six steps [4]. 
(1) Geometry graphics: built a good model to import ANSYS 
Workbench. 
(2) Material properties: input the material nature of data input. 
(3) Mesh: the mesh generates using the automatic mesh; it is finer and 
smaller calculation error but needs longer CPU time required. 
(4) Boundary conditions: Before doing the analysis of frame structure, 
research must define the fixed part of the structure. 
(5)  Analysis: analyze the relationship between stress and strain on the 
structure and analyze the manifested characteristics of the system 
modal. 
2.4 Results: 
 Analysis of strain can be observed in the structural of the ideal external 
contend; Analysis of modal and frequency can be observed in the 
structural vibration of the different frequencies.

spacious inside space that can give passengers a better ride.  But 
increasing longer distance would reduce the flexibility of driving in the 
narrow alleyways.  The height is defined from the ground to the highest 
position of the body top but not included the length of the antenna. The 
height would affect the head space of the seat and sitting pose. The space 
larger space of head inside car would not be oppressive. The more erect 
sitting position is more suitable for the long ride but it usually designs the 
lower height in order to enhance cornering stability [7].  
According to the vehicle size of Taiwan's automobile regulations, it 
has limits as: 
Length: the total cylinder displacement more than 550 cc of vehicles shall 
not exceed 4 meters; total cylinder displacement less than 550 cc 
vehicles shall not be more than 2.5 meters. 
Width: vehicles full width shall not exceed 2.5 meters. 
High: vehicles and its trailer's width must not exceed the 1.5 times of 
vehicle, and maximum high not exceed more than 2.85 meters [8]. 
 
3.1.2Ultra-light vehicle regulation 
According to Civil Aviation Administration regulations, it has limits of: 
The ultra-light vehicle: “Ultra-light vehicle” means a powered aircraft 
which is used for manned operation in the air, has a maximum takeoff 
weight of 610 kg or less, and has a takeoff speed of less than 65 km/hr at 
maximum takeoff weight or a power-off stall speed which does not 
exceed 64 km/hr [9].

2-4 single reciprocating engine. 
2-5 Propeller of fixed-wing should be fixed or only be adjusted on 
the ground; propeller of powered hang gliding should be fixed or 
auto feather; rotor of gyroplane should be double leaf, fixed pitch, 
half of the joints and prying. 
2-6 Cabins should be non-pressurized. 
2-7 Landing gear should be fixed expect powered hang gliding and 
amphibious ultra-light vehicles. 
(3) Exclude the first or second level of ultra-light vehicles is for the 
third level [10]. 
At first the Aero Runner should be classified the non-helicopter of 
second level, but 2-4 is not conforms standard, so the Aero Runner should 
belong to the third level.  The reasons for non-conform is that the single 
reciprocating engine generated the thrust is too small.  So the Aero 
Runner uses a greater thrust by the turbine engine to replace the single 
reciprocating engine [11]. 
 
3.1.3Market Specifications of reference 
Searching from Internet, there are many different specifications of 
the gyroplanes with similar performance. There is a list for two similar 
gyroplanes to compare with as in-market gyroplanes [12, 13].

straight-line driving stability; however, a short wheelbase provides better 
flexibility. The wheelbase of distance between the front and the rear is on 
behalf of car inside space. With a longer wheelbase, the inside vertical 
space is much bigger, and knee and foot space are more spacious.   
The options of wheelbase have to consider vehicle size parameters, 
quality parameters, and performance.  If the wheelbase is shorter, then 
the total length, minimum turning radius and vertical through radius are 
shorter.  But if it is too short, it will bring a range of issues such as the 
car inside space and the rear overhang are too long, that result in the 
vibration of the vertical angle is too large during the vehicle driving 
period.  Also, the car acceleration, setting to move, or axle-load transfer 
of uphill will be too large to result in worse operation, uneasy maneuver, 
and over large universal joint transmission angle.  Therefore, the choice 
of wheelbase should consider about the impact of the parties. Of course, it 
usually is designed shorter on the premise that satisfies the car inside 
space, axle-load distribution, performance, and overall layout. 
The car's wheelbase is about 54% to 60% of the total length. If the 
ratio is bigger, then not only the vertical inside space is bigger but also 
can improves the automotive vertical angle vibration. However, if the 
ratio is over than 62%, it will cause the difficulties in the layout of the 
engine, trunk and spare.  In the Aero Runner design, there will be no 
particular limits on engine, trunk and spare.  Because the wheelbase is 
too short, the vehicle might get larger vertical vibration to cause 
instability.  A bigger ratio of 64% will be chosen to reduce vertical 
vibration and improve lateral stability.   
2‐29 
 
The great tread has a great effect on the lateral stability and 
maneuverability.  But the tread could not be too large, or it would cause 
the total weight too heavy. The following formula is a relation between 
Tread and Wheelbase: 3 100( 80)
4
B W   , or 
B KL  
B – Tread (mm) 
W – Total width (mm) 
L – Wheelbase (mm) 
K – coefficient, mini cars: K = 0.55 ~ 0.64, for the other cars: K = 
0.50 to 0.54 [16]. 
Generally, the greater total vehicle mass is, the greater wheelbase is. In 
order to satisfy the different needs of users, it usually has several pairs of 
tread and wheelbase at the same time for a car product, such as the basic, 
long wheelbase, short wheelbase. Table 3-4 gives the car wheelbase data 
reference for the design [17][7].

Applying D'Alembert's principle to Figure 3-8, the automotive 
driving directions can be written as:

Equation (3.3) is called the automotive driving equation, and it is an 
important equation to calculate the straight-line behavior of automotive 
driving force performance. 
 
3.2.2 Rolling resistance 
When a vehicle is driving the tires could receive the rolling resistance. 
Rolling resistance is fF : 
f rF f N                  (3.4) 
In Equation (3.4), rf  is rolling resistance coefficient，N is normal force 
of tire. If the four tires' rolling resistance coefficients are the same, then 
acting on the car's rolling resistance is:  
f rF f W                   (3.5)

the setting position, it choices 22inch tires that the speed can approach 40 
km/h and can make the Aero Runner turns without slipping and 
overturning.

(3) stability 
 
  Mechanics of materials is the introductory study in solid mechanics. 
Using dynamics to analyze the bar, the beam, the shaft and so on or 
analyzing the force, deformation and mechanical behavior of simple 
structure to learn the basic problems of solid mechanics analysis. Then 
establishing the failure criterion and designing the component so that it 
can meet the requirements of strength, stiffness and stability. 
 
4.2 Property of material 
  The materials can be divided into isotropic and anisotropic, and 
homogeneous and heterogeneous. The isotropic material has the same 
material nature in within of structure of any direction and the 
homogeneous has the same material nature in within of structure of any 
position. Many materials in the solid mechanics analysis and calculation 
can be regarded as isotropic and homogeneous, such as steel, aluminum, 
copper. 
   
  In this design the chassis is a truss frame. Considering the security to 
make the chassis one piece could get sturdier, and reducing the weight to 
make the chassis hollow can let the chassis lightweight. Taking into 
account manufacturing with the other parts it uses 25mm*25mm square 
frame to reduce the difficulty of process.

residue permanent deformation. In addition, when the stress exceeding 
the ultimate tensile strength it will produce necking phenomenon and will 
soon reach the break. 
 
  Ductility of the isotropic material (such as steel, copper) frequently 
uses failure criteria for the Von Mises criterion. Von Mises equivalent 
stress eqv can be calculated by the following formula: 
 
2 2 2
1 2 1 3 3 2
1 [( ) ( ) ( )
2eqv
                                    (4.2) 
 
Where 
1 2 3  、 、 : Way of three dimensional of Mohr's circle can solve the three 
principal stresses 1 2 3  、 、 ; the function is to calculate the 
stress state in the coordinate transformation of structure. 
Where eqv must be positive, and the Von Mises criteria for the following 
type: 
eqv yS                                                  (4.3) 
 
  (4.3) meaning is: When Von Mises equivalent stress is less than the 
yield strength that stands for the material does not cause plastic 
deformation and permanent deformation and the structure is safe. Von 
Mises criterion is also known as the maximum distortion-energy criterion, 
such as equivalent stress with the symbol eqv  and effective stress with the

sure no matter what the number of pilots (one or two) always lets the 
center of gravity on the back seat. This design is when a person is 
driving must to seat on the front seat otherwise could lose balance of 
center of gravity. 
(3) As driving time goes on, the oil tank will be reducing, so it disposes 
under the back seat. The design will not change the location of the 
center of gravity because of the flight distance makes the fuel tank 
weight light.  
(4) The center of gravity of the whole car designs in the following of gyro 
rotor (back seat position), so our level of thrust line (propeller of 
height) can be any height. But noting the propeller cannot be too low, 
because when aero runner take off  has a angle of elevation too high 
will make the horizontal stabilizer and the propeller hit the ground.  
(5) Check conflict between the gyro rotor and propeller. The gyro rotor 
diameter is 8.4m and propeller diameter is 1.75m. Because the 
material relationship of gyro rotor that the rotor outside end to the 
center point will be about 20 to 30 centimeter height difference, the 
design should pay special attention to this point. Chassis size is setting 
such Table4-1.

Figure4-9 Analysis process. 
 
4.6 Stress analysis and load handling 
  Vehicle driving could be forced three directions force, i.e., the vertical 
force, lateral force and longitudinal force. Three directions of the moment 
are bending moment, torsional moment and yawing moment. The 
combination of these forces and moments reacts in the effect of driving 
on the different road and becomes a wide variety of computing the 
working conditions. The computational load of car depends on the road

vehicle dynamics. 
 
  I It imposes the force what the car may be faced in the analysis process, 
and sets a fixed point to identify the chassis will not move up and down 
with force, then sees the stress and strain of the force that we give them. 
Tire is usually regarded as a fixed point. In this work, the position that 
connecting a shock absorber regarded as a fixed point. 
 
  Vertical load of the car for example the chassis weight, the weight of 
automotive equipment (engine, gearbox, fuel tank, etc.), members of 
passenger, weight of luggage, as well as the quality of the non-structural 
(glass, seats, etc.). 
 
  Figure4-10 is a fixed point and the force distribution that we assumed 
in the analysis. Where ABCD is the fixed point: A&B are the front 
suspension point, C&D are the rear suspension point. E to J is the force 
distribution: E is the front seat weight, F is the back seat weight, G is the 
weight of the gyro rotor, H is the weight of the propeller, I & J is the 
weight of the gearbox and engine.

The results of the analysis of the steel, yield strength of material of 
steel is bigger than the maximum stress of its analysis, so the chassis does 
not produce permanent deformation. The chassis shell of steel material is 
6.5mm and weight is approximately 250.86kg.

stress value( 175.65MPa) of its measured and it representative the 
analysis of stress-strain is linear elastic deformation.

chassis shell of various materials. 
2. Gap of vibration in transmission will loses the energy, so it as far as 
possible to reduce the deformation of chassis.  
3. Adding more details like shock absorbers, tires, and so on to the 
system will be let the results of analyze more accurately.  
4. Aero Runner actually makes out it and can work.
