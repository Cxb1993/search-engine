the motivation to find novel ways of transmission 
enhancement and is the basis for the emphasis on 
better utilizing the available thermal capacities of 
transmission lines without compromising 
reliability. In recent years, Flexible AC 
Transmission Systems (FACTS) technology has 
been expected as a potential alternative of 
building new lines, which is based on the use of 
power electronic controlled devices for allowing 
transmission circuits to be used to their maximum 
thermal capability [1-2]. In particular the FACTS 
devices aim principally to control the three main 
parameters directly affecting AC power 
transmission namely voltage, phase angle, and 
impedance. None of the FACTS devices is new in 
basic concept but the use of advanced power 
electronics has revolutionized the design and 
engineering of them. Of the reported FACTS 
controllers, the Unified Power Flow Controller 
(UPFC) was proposed for real-time control and 
dynamic compensation of ac transmission 
systems, providing the necessary functional 
flexibility required to solve many of the problems 
facing the utility industry [3].  
It has been proved that a number of important 
control and optimization functions, which were 
unattainable in the past, can now be realized by 
utilizing these high-performance power flow 
controllers with the state-of-art computer and 
control technologies. However, in a feasible 
competitive power system structure with its 
operating mode, ideally three basic operating 
objectives must be simultaneously satisfied, i.e. to 
maximize the overall economical profits, to 
accomplish the maximum number of contracted 
power transactions with high power quality and to 
provide an acceptable level of system operating 
flexibility and reliability.  It is obvious that the 
above-mentioned objectives can not be fully 
achieved with the existing FACTS devices which 
are uniquely designed and have a fixed hardware 
configuration with conventional controllers.  In 
the aspect of controller design, the UPFC has 
multiple operating modes and complex system 
dynamics which require advanced controllers to 
achieve better performances. Thus this project 
investigates the design of advanced controllers 
based on intelligent control algorithms for a 
modular UPFC (or UFACTSD) to provide better 
control features in performing various power flow 
control functions during steady-state and transient 
operations of power systems. 
 
(二) 研究目的 
 
The main objective of this research project is 
therefore to investigate an innovative, 
multi-functional FACTS device and its related 
intelligent controllers based on fuzzy theory and 
neural networks. The proposed new FACTS 
device is attempted to have the following features:  
The modular design concept is utilized in 
designing the internal power converter units. 
Multiple control functions can be performed 
individually or concurrently. The configuration 
and various control functions can be selectively 
assigned on a real-time basis. The design of a 
feasible UFACTSD configuration and its related 
controllers to satisfy the requirements in operating 
the future competitive power system is the key 
research tasks in this project.   
To achieve the objectives mentioned above, the 
focus of the investigation is on advanced control 
applications in power system operations and 
control using UFACTSD. The following major 
research tasks have been accomplished, i.e. 1) the 
development of feasible UFACTSD hardware 
configurations and the corresponding internal 
power converter modules and the related control 
techniques, 2) the derivation of mathematical 
models suitable for steady-state and transient 
simulation studies, 3) the verification of models 
using a robust software package, 
PSCAD/EMTDC, 4) analysis of the possible 
operating modes of UFACTSD and the 
corresponding limits, 5) design of various 
advanced P-Q controllers based on the intelligent 
control theory.  Comprehensive computer 
simulation studies have been carried out to verify 
the effectiveness and the performance of the 
proposed UFACTSD and the designed controllers.

Fig. 1 Basic implementation of a UFACTSD 
 
z UFACTSD Operating Principles and Control 
Modes 
 
The UFACTSD operating principles and 
control concepts are the same as that of a UPFC, 
the basic UFACTSD configuration which consists 
of two switching voltage-sourced converters 
using gate turn off (GTO) thyristor valves (Fig. 1, 
n=3) is chosen to introduce the UFACTSD 
operating principles. The two converters labeled 
“CON-1” and “CON-2” in the figure are designed 
to be operated from a common DC link voltage 
provided by a DC storage capacitor.  In normal 
operations, the phase angle of the series voltage 
can be chosen independently of the line current 
between 0 and π2 , and its magnitude can be 
varied between zero and a pre-specified 
maximum value.  Therefore the active power can 
freely flow in either direction between the AC 
terminals of the two converters and each 
converter can also generate or absorb reactive 
power independently at its own AC output 
terminals to affect system voltages.  In the 
UFACTSD system, Converter 2, the series branch, 
is used to perform the main control functions of a 
VSUPFC.  It generates voltage, seV , at the 
system frequency with variable amplitude ( seV ) 
and phase angle ( sγ ) controlled by a proper 
switching control technique.  During the 
operation the voltage, seV , is added to the AC 
system terminal voltage, iV , by the series 
connected injection transformer, Tse. The 
UFACTSD control modes are the same as that of 
UPFC. A set of simulation studies on the control 
modes and the capacity transformation in 
UFACTSD has been carried out in this project. 
 
z Design Of Fuzzy Neural Network Based 
UFACTSD P-Q Controllers 
 
As addressed previously, the active power (P) 
and reactive power (Q) in the transmission line are 
controlled by the inserted series synchronous 
voltage, pqV , while the control of bus voltage and 
the voltage of the dc-interface is achieved by 
adjusting the output voltage of the shunt inverter, 
shV . The basic control scheme for the UFACTSD 
series and shunt inverters can be developed by 
using PQ-decoupled PI control means [13-14]. The 
outputs of these control systems are the 
corresponding modulation indices and phase-shift 
signals of the internal converters.  In this 
subsection, Fig. 2 and 3 respectively shows the 
conceptual control block diagram of the proposed 
FNN based PI controllers for the UFACTSD to 
perform the shunt reactive compensation and 
Mode A, B and C controls provided by the 
UFACTSD series branch . The SW1~4 shown in 
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 are designed to select the type of 
control scheme to be investigated (the FNN tuned 
PI control or simply PI control scheme). In Fig.2 
and 3, the reference model is designed as a 
standard second order system,

(1) Conventional Proportional-Integral 
Controllers 
 
As shown in Fig. 2 and 3, two sets of conventional 
PI based UFACTSD power flow controllers can be 
constructed with SW1, SW2, SW3 and SW4 off.  
The initial power system parameters and the 
parameters used in the PI controllers are chosen as 
follows: generator voltage (at the sending end): 
230KV °∠80 , system frequency: 60 Hz, line 
impedance: 5.29+j52.9, dc-link voltage of the UPFC: 
43kV, DC capacitor: 4000 Fμ , PI controller 
parameters: KP1=1, KI1=0.25, KP2=5, KI2=1, KP3=0.5, 
KI3=1. In this study, the location of UFACTSD is 
assigned to be at the left-side of the controlled 
transmission line and a fault is simulated at 1.6 second 
of the simulation time for a duration of 50ms. For this 
simulation case, Fig. 6(a) shows the tracking control 
results of the active power. Fig. 6(b) shows the 
corresponding control error. The corresponding series 
converter modulation index is shown in Fig. 7. For 
shunt branch control loops, Fig. 8(a) and (b) 
respectively shows the dc-link voltage and its control 
error between actual voltage and reference voltage of 
43KV. As can be seen from the results of dc-link 
voltage control error, the dc- link voltage varies 
greatly during the transient period of power flow 
control.
