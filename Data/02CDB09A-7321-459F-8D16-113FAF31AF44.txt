research is to investigate the effects of the 
rounding corners, resulting from sub-wavelength 
photolithography patterning, on the electrical test 
(E-test) signals and to determine the optimum layout 
design such that multiple E-test signals can attain 
their desired values simultaneously. Statistical 
model building and optimization methods are developed 
and applied to achieve this goal. Statistical 
modeling and optimization are to first systematically 
design experiments and build an empirical response 
surface model based on the experimental results and 
then search for the optimum on the response surface 
using Ridge Analysis methods. In this research, we 
propose a more straightforward formulation for 
optimization problems with multiple responses, such 
as multiple E-test signals. The formulation turns the 
multiple responses optimization problem into a 
quartic nonlinear programming (NLP) problem. In the 
first year of this research, we have developed a 
Ridge Search method to avoid the zigzagging behavior. 
We have also extended the ridge search method to 
solve the nonlinear constrained problem by 
incorporating the Zoutendijk method. In the second 
year, we borrowed the idea of the 
popular ＇Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG)＇ method 
to extend the Ridge Search (RS) method into 
a ＇Generalized Reduced Ridge (GRR)＇ search method. 
We also developed methods to generate multiple 
feasible initial solutions and to search for the 
global optimum. In the third year, we further 
improved the GRR method by incorporating ＇Trust 
Region (TR)＇ search method to develop 
the ＇Generalized Reduced Trust Region＇ (GRT) search 
method combining the GRG method and the improved TR 
search method. To ensure the convergence of the GRT 
search algorithm, we have provided a mathematical 
convergence proof. Instead of using the commercial 
software package to implement the proposed 
algorithms, this research project have implemented 
all the proposed methods in a stand-alone software 
program.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The information about how different geometric styles of layouts impact the circuit 
performance is important for fables design houses. Some slight changes of the channel length 
and width often lead to unexpected variations in the electricity signals. The rounding 
phenomenon will occur in the corners of poly-silicon after photolithography. Generally 
speaking, the “Active-Area” is the main cause of the variation. Examples with rounding 
phenomenon are shown in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1 Two SPICE models with rounding phenomenon. 
 
The rounding phenomenon would increase the channel drawn length, Len, and the channel 
drawn width, Wid, in Figure 1. The change of Len and Wid directly influences the 
width-to-length ration of a transistor:
 
Wid/Len. However, the major observations in E-Tests, 
saturation current (IDsat) and the threshold voltage (Vt), would be proportional to Wid/Len. 
Thus, the design house would like to obtain a setting of the design layout which has less 
variation and close to the desired electrical performances.  
 
In this case study, the design factors on the device layout are shown in Figure 2 and the upper 
bound and lower bound of these factors are summarized as Table 1. This design is a NMOS 
composite design (CCD) experiment and 10 response surface models are built (許博為 [1]). 
 
These models provide empirical relations between layout design variables and the circuit 
electrical signals. Engineers would like to obtain an optimum setting for each controllable or 
designable input variable so that different specifications of the electrical signals are met. 
 
Because the rounding phenomenon would be influenced by H1 and E1, the design rule would 
like the H1 to be as large as possible and the E1 to be as small as possible. Thus, the 
term, ( )24.01−H  ( )205.01−+ E , are added into our objective function to ensure the design factors 
close to the targets. We also added the following constraints for H1 and E1: 
1.0105.0
4.012.0
≤≤
≤≤
E
H
 
In addition, the designers are asked to minimize the rounding effect caused by the design 
factors E1 and H1. That is, they hope that changes in E1 and H1 should have minimum 
influence on the responses. That is,

This wish is also added in the objective function.  
 
2. STATISTICAL MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION 
With the response surface models established, engineers would like to obtain an optimum 
setting for each controllable or designable input variable so that different specifications of the 
E-Test parameters are met. There are two types of specifications. One is a desired target Ti for 
iyˆ  to attain. That is, we would like to minimize the difference between iyˆ  and its target Ti:

0 )(∑ −++

T
iii TbwMin xBxxb for iyˆ  with target Ti.       (2) 
 
, where wi is a user-specified weight that allows the engineer to specify the relative 
importance for iyˆ  to conform to the target. 
 
The second type of specifications is a specification window with an upper limit Ui and a lower 
limit Li: 
 
ii
T
iii UbL ≤++≤ xBxxb0  for iyˆ  with spec. windows. 
 
In addition, each design variable xm will also have an upper bound Uxm and a lower bound 
Lxm: 
 
mmm UxxLx ≤≤ . 
 
Let T represent the set of responses with targets and W represents the set of responses having 
specification windows. The optimization problem can be formulated as:

Suppose the initial point is (x1, x2) = (0.061459, 0.29578), the paths approaching the 
minima by SDM is shown in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4 Zigzagging phenomenon of SDM in IC design example 
 
In Figure 4, we magnify the SDM path and find the serious zigzagging behavior. With a 
maximum of 10,000 iterations, SDM converges to a rather poor result.  
In this year’s research, we focus on how to solve the NLP problem to minimize a quartic 
objective function f(x) subject to quadratic constraints gj(x)≦0. We first introduce the Ridge 
Analysis method which will be later used to develop Ridge Search and Projection methods to 
avoid the zigzagging behavior in some NLP problems. Then, we will develop an algorithm to 
search for the initial feasible solutions. After obtaining an initial feasible solution, we will 
introduce the semiconductor Design for Manufacturing (DFM) problems and three cases for 
our validation study. 
Consider again the objective function (2) without constraints. Many line search methods 
can be applied to this optimization problem. Most of these methods are gradient-based, i.e., 
the improvement direction is generated by ▽f(x). However, most of them would run into the 
zigzagging problem when approaching the optimum or a stationary point. To avoid zigzag 
search, we propose a method based on Ridge analysis [11].  
The purpose of ridge analysis is to find the optimums based on the empirical model built 
according to experimental results in a design region. Because the optimum is often located 
outside the design region, we have to search for the improvement path instead of the absolute 
maximum or minimum point in the region.  
matrix and the partial derivative of f(x) with respects to x using Matrix derivatives are shown 
below. The partial derivative of f(x) can be calculated as follows:

For a minimization problem, we need to select a µ below λ1, as shown in Figure 7. In 
addition, we would like to outstretch the radius R as much as possible. The problem is that the 
quadratic approximation of the quartic function may become implausible as the sphere of 
radius R swells too large. 
 In this research, we devise a Ridge Search (RS) method to tackle the problem. RS 
attempts to select an appropriate µ, corresponding to a radius R, to improve the objective 
function value without zigzagging. The quadratic approximate of the stationary point sx~ to

Search of Initial Feasible Solutions 
The Ridge Search method developed in the previous section is for an unconstrained 
optimization problem. However, each response function may be subject to specification 
constraints. In this section, we propose an algorithm to find an initial solution in the feasible 
region. According to (3) the nonlinear constraints can be described as below:

With the CCD, the algorithm of the second stage will be developed in this research task 
to complete the search of initial solutions. 
 
Ridge Projection Method 
In the previous research task, we will develop the Ridge Search method for an 
unconstrained problem and develop search algorithms to find the feasible initial solutions. We 
will extend the RS method to solve the constrained optimization problem [12] in this research 
task. 
In the Ridge Search Algorithm, when we get a point xk+1 which has a smaller objective 
value than xk. However, xk+1 may be an infeasible point in a constrained optimization problem.

To solve this problem, we first find λ*k to minimize the quartic function of f(λk). We also solve 
the quadratic inequality jLλg jkj ∀≤)(  to obtain the feasible intervals of λ*k. By considering 
both λ*k and the extreme points extreme points of the feasible interval of λk, we can obtain the 
solution to (16). 
In the example, after the line search of the Ridge Search direction from Point 2, we reach 
Point 3* which is right on the constraint. Now, we continue the ridge search. The 
improvement direction at Point 3* will lead to the next infeasible point again. In order not to 
be trapped here, we propose a projection direction to keep searching for a better solution. We 
project the direction generated by ridge search onto the tangent plane of the binding constraint. 
The projection is illustrated in Figure 10.

Therefore, we combine the Ridge Projection method and the Zoutendijk method. The 
method of Zoutendijk is one of the feasible direction search methods. It simultaneously 
considers all the binding constraints and finds an improvement direction in the feasible region. 
The method has been reviewed and summarized in the research background. 
 
4. GENERALIZED REDUCED RIDGE (GRR) SEARCH METHOD 
Ridge Search (RS) method is derived from ridge analysis. However, the objective 
function of (2) is quartic, not quadratic. We use the quadratic function 
2/))(()()()()()( )()(2)()()()( kkTkkTkk ffff xxxxxxxxxx −∇−+−∇+≅  to approximate the 
quartic objective function of (2) with respect to a given point x(k). The partial derivative

along the improving direction. If the improving solution is infeasible, the “Line Search” is 
performed to obtain a feasible improving solution.

is the Jacobian matrix to the binding constraints of (3). (x – x(k)) in (20) is actually the 
improving direction to be found. We denote (x – x(k)) by a vector d. Then, decompose d, β(k) 
and ∇H(x(k)) into the basic and the nonbasic variables:

The method to decompose the variables will be introduced later. Different from the GRG

where dq is the qth component of dN, and )(kqx  is the qth component of x(k). With the above 
adjustment, the improving direction of the basic variables can be again derived by (22). That 
ensures the improving direction feasible and effective. 
At each iteration of the GRR search, x(k) is partitioned into basic variables )(kBx  and 
nonbasic variables )(kNx , and ∇H(x(k)) is also partitioned into ∇BH(x(k)) and ∇NH(x(k)). Here, 
the number of the basic variables is the number of the binding constraints, and the basic 
variables )(kBx  should satisfy two requirements. First, ∇BH(x(k)), the bases of ∇H(x(k)), should 
be nonsingular. It ensures that the equation (14) holds. Second, )(kBx  should be larger than LxB 
and smaller than UxB. Because once the improving direction of the nonbasic variables is 
determined, the direction of the basic variables is indirectly generated by (22). If some 
elements of )(kBx  are on the upper bounds or the lower bounds, no feasible solutions after 
Line Search can be found through the GRR direction and the solution will stop at the 
boundary. 
To satisfy the above two requirements, we first rank all variables by their distances to the 
bounds. The distances between variables and bounds are computed as follows:

where distanceq is the distance of qth variable to its bound. We then choose the variables 
farther from the bounds as the basic variables. In addition, we want to ensure that the chosen 
bases are independent. Choosing independent columns can be done by Gaussian eliminatio. 
Pivots obtained by Gaussian elimination will locate the independent columns to be chosen. 
The second method to choose independent columns is rather straightforward. Starting from 
the first column of the rearranged )( )(kxH∇ , every time a column is picked its independence 
from the chosen columns will be checked with “Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)” to 
prevent singularity. We observe that the results by the two methods are similar. 
We summarize the algorithm of Generalized Reduced Ridge search method as follows: 
 Step 1: 
Let x(k) be a feasible solution at the kth search step. Choose a threshold 0>e . Check the 
binding constraints and add slack variables (the slack variables are zeros) to the binding 
inequality constraints. Set the number of basic variables equal to the number of the binding 
constraints. Approximate the objective function as a quadratic function and linearize the 
binding constraints as the formulation of (20). 
 Step 2: 
search. Both methods linearize the constraints. However, the feasible region of nonlinear 
problem (2) may not be a polyhedron. Because we use the Line Search instead of the 
Newton-Raphson method, there may be no feasible solutions along the linearized constraints. 
The linearized constraint is actually the tangent of the curve. The direction derived by both 
the GRG or the GRR search is the direction along the tangent, but the tangent is outside the 
feasible region except the point of contact. Again, this study combines the Zoutendijk’s 
method into the algorithm for this issue. As explained earlier, the Zoutendijk’s method 
generates an improving direction such that the angle between this direction and the constraint 
tangent must be greater than zero and within feasible region. However, the direction found by 
the Zoutendijk’s method is less effective. When there are feasible solutions after the Line 
Search along the direction found by the GRG method or the GRR search, the direction should 
be preferred. Otherwise, the Zoutendijk’s method is applied only when the Line Search fails 
to improve. 
Based on the “Methods of Feasible Directions”, all methods should be started with a 
feasible initial point. How to find a feasible initial point becomes another critical issue of this 
study. An algorithm is proposed to generate a feasible initial point. Nonlinear programs have 
to be solved in this algorithm in order to find the initial point. 
In problem (2), there are three types of constraints. The variable boundary constraint is 
the easiest constraint to satisfy. We can easily find a point xˆ  within the bound. We then try to 
satisfy the equality constraints with the following problem:

subject to 
qq xqx UxL ≤≤   q = 1,…, n 
 
If the optimal objective value is equal to zero, the optimal solution x~  will satisfy the 
equality constraints. Otherwise, the nonlinear program may be infeasible. 
After the equality constraints are met, all the linear or nonlinear inequality constraints 
have to be considered now. The idea is to establish a model in which the objective function is 
the penalty of unsatisfied constraints. By minimizing the penalty, the algorithm deals with the 
unsatisfied constraints one at a time until all constraints are met. By checking the feasibility of 
x~ , all inequality constraints are divided into two sets: the satisfied set F and the unsatisfied 
set I. Choose one constraint from set I. Solve the following problem with initial solution x~

In this process, if the iterative objective value is negative, the solution can be returned. 
Replace x~  by the optimal solution. Redefine set F and I and solve (30) iteratively. When all 
constraints are satisfied, terminate the algorithm. 
Based on the above description, any initial solution violating any inequality constraints is

KKT point. 
 
Proof: 
See also Theorem 10.6.1 of  Bazaraa, Shetty [3].

Consider problem (39). The Generalized Reduced Trust Region search algorithm will reach a 
KKT point at x(k) as ∞→k . 
 
Proof:  
We have 0inf lim =

Therefore, by Theorem 2 x(k) is the KKT point as ∞→k . 
 
7. CASE STUDY  
Here we allocate 8 initial solutions for the local search. Seven feasible initial solutions could 
be found. We suppose the terminal criterion is less than 10−6 between two iterative objective 
values or more than seven hundred steps of search. The optimum design is summarized in 
Table 3. Table 4 shows the GRT performance against the GRG Method and LINGO.

8. CONCLUSONS 
In this research, we have proposed a comprehensive solution to the multiple response surfaces 
optimization problem. The procedure starts from using a more straightforward formulation 
than conventional MRSM. We name the formulated problem a statistical multi-objective 
optimization (SMOO) problem. To solve the SMOO problem, we use the trust region as a 
fundamental search approach to develop the “Generalized Trust-region (GRT)” search 
method that also combines the idea of the GRG method and Trust-region method to further 
improve the search performance. We have also proved the convergence of the proposed GRT 
algorithm. The GRT search algorithm is also applied to the circuit layout design problem and

這次會議的主席是北京清華大學管理科學與工程系的陳劍教授，陳教授與
海外華人學術界關係良好，此次會議廣邀海外知名學者為 program committee 
members。遺憾的是，此次會議卻沒有邀請太多台灣方面的學者參與相關會議準
備工作。唯一受邀來自台灣的是目前任職資策會前瞻科技研究所所長的前 IBM
林蔚君博士為 Sponsored Cluster Chair 及 program committee member，卻不見任
何台灣學術界學者的參與，其實陳劍教授與台灣學術界關係緊密，此次私下亦
邀請本所陳俊宏教授(與電機系合聘)參加會前 VIP邀宴。據陳俊宏教授的轉述，
此次會議原本依照 INFORMS 會議規格，僅準備周日的 Welcome Reception，在
陳劍教授積極爭取下，募得額外經費於周二晚上另外舉辦晚宴，該晚宴雖然有
中國傳統技藝表演，卻是本人參加過國際會議晚宴餐飲品質最差的一次，同桌
雖坐買來自新加坡、中國、加拿大、台灣的學者，卻留下大部分食物形成浪費。 
就像 INFORMS 的一般年度會議，本次會議並沒有設定會議主題(Theme)，
因此會議涵蓋了作業研究及管理科學(Operations Research and Management 
Sciences)的理論發展及應用。以下針對此次與會的主要幾個行程活動做心得報
告。  
1. OR/MS 之發展趨勢 
雖然此次會議並無設定任何主題，但可從所邀請的 plenary speakers 中看出
會議主辦者對於 OR/MS 在中國甚或亞洲的發展趨勢。由於到達北京已經是週
一，當天下午馬上聽了 Prof. Avishai Mandlebaum的 “Data-based Service Networks: 
A Research Framework for Asymptotic Inference, Analysis and Control of Service 
Systems”，這個演講提出了利用 Data 直接建立 asymptotic, inferential模型，可以
二、   建議 
1. 此次大會是在中國首都也是古城北京舉行，吸引了相當多的國際學者與
會。會議在 Olympic Park附近的國家會議中心，主辦單位雖然爭取增加
傳統中國晚宴，但是其餐飲品質不佳，只有傳統技藝表演可以讓與會者
留下印象。這是未來台灣辦國際會議值得小心借鏡之處。 
2. 本次會議雖然有來自台灣不少專家學者語彙，但僅有一名來自台灣的專
家受邀於 program committee裏。探究原因，除了參加學術會議外，台灣
工業工程與管理科學領域學者在 INFORMS 學會活動的參與度太低，未
來應多鼓勵相關領域學者加強參與 INFORMS 的學會活動。
