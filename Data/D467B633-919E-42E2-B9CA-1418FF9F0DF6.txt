Keywords: power amplifier, HEMT, MHEMT, breakdown voltage, field-plate 
    This project proposes a novel in-sityu metallization field-plate, which is applied to the 
fabrication of high-power, high breakdown voltage amplifiers such as HEMT, MHEMT. The main 
processes related to in-situ metallization field-plate include sacrificial layer, under-cut window and 
off-set gate metallization. No additional silicon-related process is needed. Moreover, sub- and deep 
sub-micron level gate can also be implemented using one-micron optical aligner. Depositing gate 
metal across a step undercut between the Schottky barrier layer and the insulator-like layer is 
employed to obtain a reduced gate length of 0.4μm with an additional 0.6μm field plate from a 
1-μm gate window. Most dc and ac characteristics including carrier density (IDSS = 451mA/mm), 
transconductance (gm,max = 225mS/mm), breakdown voltage (VBD(DS)/VBD(GD) = 22/-22.5 V), 
gate-voltage swing (GVS = 2.24 V), cutoff and maximum oscillation frequencies ( ft / fmax = 
17.2/32 GHz) are improved compared with those of a 1-μm gate device without field plate. At a 
VDS of 4.0 V, a maximum power added efficiency of 36％ with an output power of 13.9 dBm and 
a power gain of 8.7 db are obtained at a frequency of 1.8 GHz. The saturated output power and the 
linear power gain are 316 mW/mm and 13db, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION
H ETERODOPED-CHANNEL field-effect transistors(HDCFETs) have recently received considerable
attention as an alternate to conventional MESFETs or HEMTs
[1]–[4]. HDCFETs generally have an undoped wide-gap layer
as the Schottky barrier and a heavily doped narrow-gap layer
as the channel. Therefore, they exhibit a low ON resistance
while maintaining a high breakdown voltage (BV). Further
performance enhancement can be implemented by shortening
their gate length [5], [6]. So, HDCFETs with mushroom gates
or T-gates fabricated by using delicate multilayer photoresist
profile in combination with deep-UV or e-beam lithography
were reported using this approach. Besides, the formation
of V-gates by optical lithography V-grooves has also been
demonstrated to achieve submicrometer gate lengths [7], [8].
Taping photoresist is another technology that is recently
reported to shorten the gate length [9]. To enhance device
breakdown, field plates deposited on SiN or SiO2 insulator
have been widely applied to improve the device power
performance [10]–[12]. However, the field plates formed after
the gate metal and the insulator deposition require additional

processes and are at the expense of frequency performance
due to the increased gate–drain capacitance. Moreover, no
specific fabrication technologies have been reported on
performing the field plates and shortening the gate length
simultaneously. In this study, In0.5Ga0.5P−In0.2Ga0.8As
HDCFETs were fabricated with a new gate metal formation.
The key fabrication technology used to reduce the gate length
is to deposit the gate metal across a step undercut between the
InGaP Schottky barrier layer and the GaAs insulator-like layer.
Consequently, a reduced gate length and an additional field
plate were simultaneously formed by splitting the deposited
metal. The formation of the step undercut is used to eliminate
the undesired fringing capacitance [13]. The reduction of
the gate–source capacitance due to decreased gate length
can completely compensate the increase of the gate–drain
capacitance induced by the field plate. Thus, not only an
enhanced transistor breakdown but also an improved parasitic
capacitance is expected.
II. DEVICE FABRICATION AND EXPERIMENT
The HDCFET structure was grown on a (100)-oriented semi-
insulating GaAs substrate by low-pressure metal organic chem-
ical vapor deposition. It consisted of a 0.6-µm undoped GaAs
buffer, a 15-nm n+−In0.2Ga0.8As channel highly doped to
n+ = 5× 1018 cm−3, a 20-nm undoped In0.5Ga0.5P Schottky
barrier layer, and finally a 0.12-µm undoped GaAs insulator-
like layer (Fig. 1). After removing the insulator-like layer, Hall
measurements indicate that the room temperature carrier sheet
density and the electron mobility are 4.5× 1012 cm−2 and
3650 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The HDCFET fabrication
started with device mesa isolation. AuGe/Ni was deposited,
lifted off, and thermally annealed as the drain and source
electrodes with a spacing of 3 µm. Step undercut profiles were
formed by selectively removing the upper GaAs layer through
a 1.0-µm patterned photoresist window [9]. Au metal was de-
posited through another 1.0-µm patterned photoresist window
across the step undercut. It should be noted that misalignment
of Au metal could cause a change in gate length and therefore
a shift in performance. Thus, alignment marks according to
the undercut patterns designed in the same mask were used.
Basically, the variation in gate length achievable is 0.05 µm for
our I-line aligner. Clearly, such a gate metal formation is not
expected to be any problem if one can use state-of-the-art tools.

KEY RESULTS OF FABRICATED DEVICES WITH GATE LENGTH/FIELD
PLATE LENGTH/INSULATOR THICKNESS OF 0.4/0.6/0.12, 1.0/0/0,
0.6/0.4/0.12, AND 0.4/0.6/0.06 µm IN HDCFETS A–D
and a GaAs insulator thickness of 0.12 (0.06) µm. It is found
that current drivability and device linearity are enhanced as
the gate length is reduced. BVs are directly related to the
field plate length. A longer field plate implies a larger BV.
Comparing the performance between HDCFETs A, B, and
C, we found that the ft enhancement is mainly due to the
gate length reduction, especially the decrease of gate–source
capacitance (CT = CGS + CFP, where CT is total gate capac-
itance, CGS is the gate-metal-induced capacitance, and CFP
is the field-plate-induced capacitance). Extracted results from
a two-dimensional simulator (Atlas) show that (CGS + CFP)
are (174.75 + 64.83), (371 + 0), and (252 + 50.57) fF for
HDCFETs A, B, and C, respectively. HDCFET D with a much
lower ft compared to that of HDCFET A is due to an increased
gate-to-drain capacitance (105.41–64.83 fF) resulting from a
thinner GaAs insulator.
IV. CONCLUSION
A new process for gate formation was applied to fabricate
InGaP-InGaAs HDCFETs with a submicrometer gate and a
field plate. The key method is to deposit a 1-µm gate metal
across a step undercut between the Schottky barrier layer and
the insulator-like layer. HDCFETs with a 0.4- and a 0.6-µm
gate have been successfully fabricated. The drain-to-source BV
is as high as 22 V for an HDCFET with a gate length of 0.4 µm
and a field plate length of 0.6 µm. Furthermore, a GVS of
2.24 V with a wide current range of ∼450 mA/mm was
obtained. The cutoff and maximum oscillation frequencies of
17.2 and 32 GHz are also improved as compared to 10.5 and
29 GHz from a 1-µm gate device without field plate. At a VDS
of 4.0 V, the maximum PAE, the saturated output power, and
the linear power gain are measured to be 36%, 316 mW/mm,
and 13 dB, respectively.
