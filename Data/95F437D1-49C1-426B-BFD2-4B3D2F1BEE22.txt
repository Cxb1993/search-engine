Abstract—In this project, a method is proposed to extract the 
parameters of direct- and canonical coupled-resonator filters, 
such as the resonant frequencies, coupling coefficients, and Q  
factors. Firstly, the ABCD  and Y  matrices are derived from 
the simulation or measured results. The components of the filter 
in each stage are then decomposed based on these. Since lossy 
components can be individually extracted, this method is 
applicable to lossy filter designs with non-uniform Q  
distribution. The equivalent circuits of tapped-line input and 
output are also presented, which are necessary for increasing the 
accuracy of the proposed method. From these extracted 
parameters, the detuned components can be found and fine tuned. 
Several filter examples are given to validate the proposed 
method.

I. INTRODUCTION 
IGH-PERFORMANCE filters with high selectivity and low 
reflection and transmission losses are usually required in 
microwave communications systems. Circuit tuning is the last 
and important step in the process of filter design. It determines 
the final performances. A time-domain filter tuning method is 
proposed in [1], which can be used for investigating the 
inaccuracy of the resonant frequencies of the resonators and 
the coupling between them. However, whether the resonant 
frequencies are higher or lower than the specifications can not 
be determined. The effect of component losses on coupling is 
also not clear. The group delay can also be used for filter 
tuning [2]. In this method, the resonators that are not under 
tuning must be shorted. This is easy with cavity filters, 
however, is not practical for widely-used planar designs. 
Optimization is an alternative method for filter tuning [3], [4]. 
However, the time spent on this will significantly increase 
with the order of filters. Furthermore, the global minimum of 
the cost function is not always guaranteed. The study of [5] 
has provided closed-form formulas for resonant frequencies 
and coupling coefficients, from the zeros and poles of the 
measured input impedance of the filters with the output port 
shorted. However, the component losses, which can alter the 
frequencies of the zeros and poles, are ignored. This could 
result in an incorrect input impedance formulation. The 
methods of circuit parameter extraction proposed in [6] and [7] 
also assumed that filters are lossless. This can not be applied 
to the planar filter designs with non-negligible dielectric and 
conductor losses. 
The extraction method for coupling matrix has been 
discussed in [8], however, the extraction of loaded Q , which 
is also the important design parameter for filters, is not 
addressed. Furthermore, this method can not tolerate filters 
containing lower- Q  resonators. The method in [9] have 
provided a formulation to derive the lossless circuit models of 
filters from measurements. However, filters composed of 
high-Q resonators are also required. The study of [10] 
introduced lossy terms into the canonical transversal model of 
filters, and therefore the component losses can be evaluated. In

loading effects caused by these structures should be excluded 
in order to find the correct filter parameters. In this section, the 
equivalent circuits of the frequently used parallel coupled-line 
and tapped-line structures, as shown in Fig. 4, are discussed. 
They are necessary for the removal of the extra loading effects 
caused by these structures. 
A. Parallel Coupled-Line Structure 
The approximate equivalent circuit of the parallel coupled 
lines with characteristic impedances 0eZ  and 0oZ  and 
electrical length 0  is shown in Fig. 5. The equivalent circuit 
consists of an admittance inverter 01J  and transmission-line 
sections with characteristic impedance 0Z  and electrical 
length 0  on its sides [14]. From the study in [14], one can 
find the characteristic impedance 0Z  in terms of the 
parameters of parallel coupled lines as

, 
  (41) 
and then the additional input and output transmission-line 
sections are removed to eliminate the extra loading effects. 
The parameters 0eZ , 0oZ , and 0  can be evaluated from the 
physical dimension of the parallel coupled lines. Although 
these parameters are not derived directly from the 
measurement or simulation, they are sufficient for the filter 
terminations to be shifted to the appropriate reference planes. 
B. Tapped-Line Structure 
The tapped-line structure can be treated as an impedance 
transformer for the input and output terminations to achieve 
proper impedance level [15]. However, the transformed 
impedance is frequency-dependent within the passband, and 
the assumption of constant 01J and , 1n nJ   will lead to 
incorrect extracted parameters. Therefore the equivalent 
circuits for the filters with tapped-line structures should be 
modified. The representation of the tapped-line circuit is 
shown in Fig 6(a), where a redundant admittance inverter 
01J R  is inserted between the termination and the tapped 
transmission lines with impedance 0Z  and electrical lengths 
1  and 2 . The electrical lengths 1  and 2  are defined at 
the central frequency of the filter, 0 . Let 1 1 0tan( )T    , 
2 2 0tan( )T    , and 0 0r Z R . As the study in [15], the 
equivalent circuit of the tapped-line structure can be derived as 
that shown in Fig. 6(b), which contains the transmission-line 
section with characteristic impedance 0R  and electrical 
length  , an admittance inverter 01J  , and the resonator in 
the first stage, 1Y , where

In the equivalent circuit, the additional transmission-line 
section has the characteristic impedance that equals the source 
impedance 0R , and it should be removed firstly. Note that its 
electrical length   is a function of the parameters of the 
tapped-line structure. Equation (43) implies that 01J   has 
non-negligible variation in the passband. As an Example, the 
typical variation of normalized 01J   around the passband is 
shown in Fig. 7, where the normalized frequencies –1 and 1 
correspond to the frequencies of band edges of the passband. 
The impedances are given by 0 0 50 R Z    and the 
electrical lengths are 1 75    and 2 105    at 0 . It 
shows that 01J   changes form 1.12 to 0.88 in the passband, a 
variation of 25%. Therefore the frequency-dependent 01J   
should be taken into account. Moreover, it is found that (44) is 
approximately a linear function around the passband, and thus

coefficient in the passband does not agree with the Chebyshev 
function. This is all due to the changes of equivalent source 
and load impedances by the tapped lines. To prove this, the 
frequency-dependent 01J   could be removed and replaced by 
constant 01J , and the response which fits in with the 
specification is obtained, as shown in Fig. 11(b). It is well 
known that the direct-coupled-resonator filters are designed 
based on synchronously tuned resonators. However, in order 
to compensate the effects of the frequency-dependent 01J  , 
asynchronously tuned resonators becomes necessary. As an 
example, an alternative filter was designed to have 
equal-ripple reflection coefficient in the passband, and the 
result is shown in Fig. 12. The coupling coefficients and 
external Q’s are identical to those of the second example, 
except the resonant frequencies of the resonators are given by 
1 3 5 2.002      and 2 4 1.999   . 
Example 3 
The third example is also a fifth-order direct-coupled- 
resonator filter and it has the same specification.  All the 
elements are tuned except the component Q  distribution is 
given by [200 400 800 600 100]. The comparison between the 
simulated and extracted responses is shown in Fig. 13. The 
extracted parameters are listed in Table II, which shows that 
they have good agreement with those in the simulated circuit. 
This example shows that the proposed method can not only 
accurately extract the resonant frequencies and coupling 
coefficients, but also the unloaded Q ’s of the resonators in 
each stage.

as resonant frequencies, coupling coefficients, external Q ’s, 
and unloaded Q ’s, are introduced. The formulation of 
ABCD  and Y  matrices for the filter is built from the 
simulation or measured response. The elements in each stage 
can then be decomposed successively by the proposed 
procedure. For the removal of the extra loading effects of the 
input and output, the equivalent circuits of coupled-line and 
tapped-line structures are discussed. It was found that the 
transformed source and load impedances are 
frequency-dependent due to the tapped-line structure, and thus 
it should be carefully dealt with. This method provides a 
general diagnosis of microwave filters, which is not restricted 
to the designs with uniform Q  distributions. The extracted 
parameters can help the designer to find the detuned elements 
and provide the information for their fine tuning. Three filter 
tuning example and a filter designed with non-uniform- Q  
resonators are presented, and they have shown that their 
circuit parameters can be accurately extracted by the proposed 
method.
