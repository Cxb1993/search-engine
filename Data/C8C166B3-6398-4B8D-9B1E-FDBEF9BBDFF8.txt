Abstract：(Keywords：tracking servo system、tracking error signal、DVD-ROM) 
In this report, the tracking error signal generated by differential phase detection 
(DPD) is theoretically analyzed and numerically simulated. The tracking error signal 
(TES) is sensitive to the radial tilt angle but not to tangential tilt angle. A DVD-ROM 
model is built to simulate optical pickup in DVD drive and an overall tracking servo 
system is design to simulate tracking performance. Tilt effects on tracking error signal 
are analyzed and are compensated by a tilt compensator in tracking servo system. 
 
1. Introduction 
The disk tilt caused by disk oscillation introduces the aberrations of laser spot on 
a disk, and deteriorates the quality of data and servo signals in the read-out process. 
Also, the laser spot no longer focuses in the center of track and tracking errors will 
happen with some effects of cross talk. The denser the tracks are, the more serious the 
cross talk is. 
Now, the DVD-R/RW writers have equipped with the tilt control mechanism 
already, but DVD-ROM and DVD player do not provide such function. In the 
specification of next-generation high density DVD (HD DVD and Blue-ray Disc), the 
reading condition will be more rigorous such that the mechanism of tilt servo must be

First of all, a laser diode is regarded as a Gaussian beam, and the optical field of 
laser diode could therefore be described as Gaussian distribution:

3. Influence of Disk Tilt on Tracking Error Signal 
We first introduce the differential phase detection [7]. Figure 2(a) depicts the 
position of pits on the disk that affects the intensity of reflected laser beam as well as 
the summations of diagonal signals (1+3 and 2+4 signals) due to diffractions. When 
the laser spot is in the center of the track (pit is in the center), 1+3 and 2+4 signals 
will have the same variations of phase. If the laser spot is off to the right of the track 
(pit is off to the left), 1+3 signal will lead 2+4 signal. On the contrary, if the laser spot 
is off to the left of the track (pit is off to the right), 1+3 signal will lag 2+4 signal. 
If track moves from off to left of the pickup head (PUH) to right of the PUH, we 
will get 1+3 and 2+4 signals as shown in Figure 2(b). We first use comparators to

We assume that the disk is a rigid body so that we can disregard the material 
properties and simplify the oscillation model . The oscillation mainly results from the 
angular misalignment of the disk in the normal and rotation axis. The total angular 
misalignment (total tilt) is 0.6 degree and the disk oscillation frequency is 1 Hz. 
Figure 4(a) shows tilts in tangential and radial direction. At beginning, the total tilt is 
in tangential direction. The track displacement shown in figure 4(b) is the distance 
between current track center and initial track center position, and it depends on radial 
tilt only.

Figure 5 depicts the block diagram of the modified control model with tilt 
sensor and the tilt compensator. The tilt sensor can compute the tilt condition and give 
the information to tilt compensator to compensate TE from optical pickup. In Figure

5. Conclusions 
The main contribution of this work is to find out the effects of 3-dimensional 
disk tilt on the tracking error signals. Although effects of radial tilt are more serious 
than that of tangential tilt, both tilt angles are taken into consideration in our 
mathematical model of the pick-up. The total tilt angle α is composed of the 
tangential and radial tilt angles that are orthogonal to each other. With this 
3-dimensional tilt angle we can built an optical model that describes the 
3-dimensional oscillation of the disk and show how the photo detector signal affected 
by the tilt through simulation. 
We proposed an offset table to compensate the offset value of the tracking error 
signals resulted from the radial tilt. The offset value is significant when radial tilt 
angle exist and the simulation shows the results. A modified control loop is built in 
this report for improving the tracking performance under the disk oscillation. This 
loop includes a tilt compensator to adjust the tracking error signal with respect to the 
tilt angles. We can see that the modified system with tilt compensator behaves well 
enough to satisfy the DVD specification.
