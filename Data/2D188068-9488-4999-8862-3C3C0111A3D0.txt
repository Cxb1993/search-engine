ultrasound compounding system that improves the quality of ultrasound images with moving targets. 
In our setup, the temporal image sequences acquired from a regular ultrasound system can be 
further processed for compounding, which cannot normally be done without a compound imaging 
system. One major advantage of the proposed method is the effectiveness and efficiency of nonrigid 
registration, which does not require any special hardware platform or acoustic probe. Thus, the 
method can be implemented as standalone image compounding software or as part of an ultrasound 
compounding hardware system. 
In the proposed system, we designed an adaptive feature weighted mechanism with a 
hierarchical structure to estimate the dense motion field from the ultrasound image sequence. 
Adjacent frames are first registered and warped to match the reference frame and then averaged to 
generate the compound image. In experiments, the speckle reduction and contrast improvement 
performances were tested based on several criteria. The compounding results for both phantom and 
in vivo clinical images showed significant improvement in both quantitative and visual appearance.

where P(ai|bi) is independent of the estimated parameters and can be omitted. That is, restriction of 
possible solutions is made, based on the a priori information, P(vi|bi), to make the motion 
estimation problem well-posed such that a stable and unique solution can be found. 
To reduce the computational complexity of the full search block matching algorithm, several 
fast algorithms have been proposed24-26. Here, a hierarchical method is adopted in the system. First, 
for each image, an image pyramid can be defined as a sequence of image levels {L0,L1,…,Lk-1,Lk}, 
where the resolution superscript will span from 0 for the finest resolution to k for the coarsest one. 
This reduction process can be formed by successively averaging over 2×2 neighboring pixels on the 
lower levels. The block matching algorithm can then be performed on the corresponding image 
pyramids based on a top-down strategy, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the following experiments, three 
more image levels (k=3) are generated to build the pyramid. 
Using this hierarchical structure, maximizing the a posteriori likelihood probability defined in Eq. 4 
can be rewritten as:

The local statistics α can be easily measured on the image, and a smaller α indicates a higher 
possibility that the processing pixel belongs to a homogeneous region. Hence, α can be regarded as 
the feature values and motion estimation with these temporally stable features should be more 
accurate and reliable. 
In addition, an inversely distance-weighted constraint in is adopted to preserve the smoothness 
property. Based on the assumption that the tissue motion field is continuous, the motion vector 
being estimated is strongly influenced by the motion vectors on the nearby tissues, but is less 
influenced by those of the tissues further away. Therefore, the weighting factor in Eq. 7,

designed to include both the local statistics, α, and the inverse distance factor. This weighting

the following experiments, nine frames are compounded to generate a single compound image, that 
is, N=9. 
To test performance of different compounding strategies, several techniques such as mean, 
median and scaled L2 mean have also been investigated17,31,32. In general, according to these 
researches, there are no significant differences between the resultant images using different 
compounding strategies. In the system described, the compounding operator is replaceable, and a 
mean operator is adopted for frame compounding. Generally, the intensity of a tracking material 
will not be consistent because of speckle decorrelations. The intensity will be degraded after 
applying the mean operator and the compound image will hence be a little darker than the original 
speckle image. To compensate for this intensity degrading effect, the resulting compound image is 
normalized by multiplying a scale value, λ: 
cmd
org
μ
μλ =
,                (11) 
where μorg and μcmd are the mean intensities of the original speckle image and the compound image, 
respectively. Thus, the mean intensity of the compound image is consistent with the mean intensity 
of the original speckle image. Note that, the intensity value is assigned with 255 when the 
normalized value is larger than 255.

extraction. To show the advantages of motion compounding for margin definition, the gradient 
vector flow (GVF) snake33 was adopted to show its ability to extract object boundaries with and 
without applying motion compounding. 
Fig. 4 (e) and (f) show the extracted boundaries of the original speckle image and the 
compound image, respectively, by using the GVF snake with the same parameters and initial 
contour. As shown in Fig. 4 (e) and (f), the extracted object boundaries were substantially better 
defined in the compound image. To validate the segmentation results, the extracted object 
boundaries could normally be compared with the ground truth. However, in this case, the correct 
boundaries were unknown because the phantom was compressed and the shape of the object was 
hence deformed. Therefore, a substitute criterion, the local curvature, was calculated to evaluate the 
segmentation results because the extracted shape of the object was supposed to be smooth. If we let 
p1=(x1, y1), p2=(x2, y2), …, pn=(xn, yn) be n snake points along the extracted contour, the local 
curvature of pi can be defined as ||di − di-1||, where di and di-1 are the normalized vectors of pi+1 − pi 
and pi − pi-1, respectively. In this experiment, the average local curvature of the GVF snake without 
motion compounding was 0.19 ± 0.25, and was improved to 0.16 ± 0.19 with motion compounding. 
A smoother contour could be extracted and both the average local curvature and its standard 
deviation were decreased by applying the motion compounding before boundary detection.

Clinical Data Analysis 
Motion analysis in ultrasound imaging is commonly used as a diagnostic tool for investigating 
tissue deformation and providing a mathematical description of tissue mechanics. However, a fast 
acquisition speed might lead to a decrease in the spatial resolution, with poor definition of 
anatomical structures and high levels of speckle noise. To demonstrate the usefulness of the 
proposed compounding algorithm for in vivo image sequences, we undertook several ultrasound 
examinations with tissue motion, including musculoskeletal and myocardial experiments. The 
proposed motion compounding method was also compared with the spatial Gaussian smooth filter 
and the adaptive weighted median filter (AWMF),27 which uses the local statistics weighting of the 
median filter to remove the speckle and preserve the signal boundary. These two methods are 
widely used in smoothing the speckle noise in ultrasound images. 
In the musculoskeletal experiment, images were obtained by scanning the forearm in 
longitudinal cross-section. The images were taken from the muscle portion of the flexor digitorum 
profundus when the subject’s middle finger moved from extension to flexion. In the imaging 
process, the probe was held by an expert and placed as parallel to the moving direction of the 
observed muscle as possible. An example frame is shown in Fig. 5 (a) and the estimated motion 
field using the proposed motion estimation method is shown in Fig. 5 (b). From the motion vectors, 
it is easy to differentiate among the muscle groups involved in finger contraction. The compound 
images with and without applying the motion compensation are shown in Fig. 5 (c) and (d), 
respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 (c) and (d), the proposed motion estimation method could correctly 
compensate for the motion between frames, while the compound image without motion 
compensation shows a large number of artifacts caused by the motion blurring effect. In addition, 
spatial filters were applied to show their ability to enhance the speckle images. Fig. 5 (e) and (f) 
show these Gaussian and AWMF filtered images, respectively.

the estimated motion vector fields could fill the needs of inter-frame correspondence in the 
compounding computation and achieved good consistency with the observations of the clinician. 
Fig. 6 (c) (g) show the compound images and Fig. 6 (d) (h) show the AWMF filtered images of Fig. 
6 (a) (e), respectively. 
In the myocardial experiment, the given B-scan image sequence generally contains two 
homogeneous regions: the myocardium and the ventricle part. Therefore, the effect of motion 
compounding on the image statistics could be investigated by calculating the speckle SNR and 
CNR. Fig. 7 (a) shows an example frame of an echocardiography sequence, and Fig. 7 (b) shows 
the compound image. Fig. 7 (c) and (d) show the Gaussian filtered image with σ=1 and σ=5, 
respectively. Fig. 7 (e) shows the AWMF filtered image. Table 1 shows the calculated speckle SNRs 
and CNRs by using different methods. As shown in Table 1, the speckle SNR and CNR of the 
Gaussian filtered images increase when the selected σ increases. When σ=5, the CNR for the 
Gaussian filtering was close to the compound image. However, the Gaussian filtered images 
appeared to be significantly over-smoothed and the texture details were smoothed out. According to 
these results, the proposed motion compounding technique outperformed the spatial filters, with a 
higher SNR and CNR, while keeping more texture details.

Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we proposed a new software-based motion compounding system to improve the image 
quality of ultrasound image sequences. The proposed method does not require a special hardware 
platform and can be implemented as a standalone software system. The proposed motion 
compounding concept can successfully average adjacent frames, which are registered and warped to 
the reference image, to generate a compound image with reduced speckle noise and enhanced 
contrast. By adopting a hierarchical structure, we apply the adaptive feature weighted technique to 
estimate the motion field in multiple resolutions. This approach was found very effective in reliable 
motion tracking for ultrasound images. Thus the compound images can preserve correct texture 
details and reduce artifacts generated by speckle noises and target movement. The experiments also 
achieve significantly higher SNR and CNR values that reflect the improvements in speckle 
reduction and contrast enhancement. Generally the proposed compounding method is valuable in 
improving the quality of regularly acquired ultrasound images for better visualization, clinical 
assessment and image post-processing.
