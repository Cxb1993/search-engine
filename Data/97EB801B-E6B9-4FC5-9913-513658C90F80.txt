Abstract  —  A planar four-port double-ring crossover 
junction with arbitrary diagonal port impedances is designed 
and realized. The circuit consists of two concentric rings 
connected with four transmission line sections. It allows the two 
pairs of diagonal ports of the junction to have different 
characteristic impedances. Based on the transmission-line 
theory, design equations are formulated and design curves are 
provided. Two microstrip circuits are realized to validate the 
idea. One operates at 2.45 GHz and the other at 5.2 GHz. Both 
circuits have excellent performance such as good return loss and 
isolation. The measured total power loss is less than 4.8%. The 
measured results agree very well with simulation counterparts. 
Index Terms — Coupler, crossover junction, planar circuit, 
ring, termination impedance. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Crossover of two transmission lines is one of the most 
important issues in design of the modern RF and microwave 
integrated circuits. Recently, many papers on the use or 
design of novel crossover circuits have been presented [1-11]. 
In a fully planar circuit, when two signal traces cross over 
each other, the most intuitive way to have good isolation is to 
use three-dimensional structure such as via, wire-bond and 
air-bridge [1-3]. To characterize the microstrip crossing, full-
wave analysis is inevitable when operation frequency is high 
[1]. The coplanar waveguide crossover junction circuit 
demonstrated in [2] shows excellent performance up to 
millimeter-wave bands. In [3], some possible improved 
microstrip crossover junctions are studied and analyzed. 
To reduce the design complexity, a series of multi-port 
planar couplers with crossover applications have been 
presented in [4-10]. An ideal four-port crossover can provide 
0-dB insertion loss to diagonal ports and perfect isolation to 
adjacent ports. In [4], microstrip and stripline crossovers are 
contrived on the basis of two cascaded branch-line hybrids. 
In [5], octave-wide matched symmetrical and reciprocal four- 
and five-port networks are investigated. In [6], a circular disk 
is proposed for a symmetrical and reciprocal four-port 
crossover junction. In [7], a novel planar configuration of 0-
dB directional coupler is presented as a single-layer 
crossover for use in microwave integrated circuits. The 
“window”-design circuits are composed of several branch-
line couplers connected in two dimensions. Such circuits may 
have an improved bandwidth if the characteristic impedances 
of the constitution branches can be properly designed [8].  
Recently, in [9], a double-ring structure is proposed for 
design of microstrip four-port crossover coupler. The 
eigenmode model is developed for analysis to investigate the 
circuit performance. The measured data of the circuit show 
that the isolation and return loss of the prototype coupler 
exceed 20 dB over a bandwidth of 20%. An improved 
version is investigated in [10]. A four-port crossover coupler 
with a much simpler configuration is analyzed in [11]. Based 
on the transmission line theory, its analysis equations can be 
easily formulated and design graphs can be created.  
Note that in [4]-[11] the four ports have identical 
termination impedances. In many applications, however, 
there is a need for two transmission lines crossover each 
other having different characteristic impedances. In this 
paper, an improved microstrip double-ring crossover junction 
with arbitrary termination impedances is devised based on the 
circuit topology studied in [10]. In order to maintain the 
circuit symmetry, each pair of diagonal ports is assumed to 
have identical termination impedances. Extra geometry 
parameters are incorporated into the design, and emphasis is 
placed on circuit formulation and realization. With aid of the 
transmission line theory, it is found that only two 
simultaneous equations are sufficient for determining the 
circuit geometry. Then several sets of design curves are 
created and discussed. On the strength of these plots, all 
structure parameters can be readily obtained once the port 
impedances are given. Two circuits with different operation 
frequencies are carried out and the measured responses are 
used to validate the theoretical analysis and simulation data. 
In the following, Sec. II shows the structure and 
formulation of the proposed crossover junction. Some useful 
design graphs are also provided. Sec. III demonstrates the 
simulation and measurement results. Sec. IV draws the 
conclusion.
