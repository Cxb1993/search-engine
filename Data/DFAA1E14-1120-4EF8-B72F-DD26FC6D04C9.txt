1. INTRODUCTION 
Digital halftoning [1] is a technique for changing multi-tone 
images into 2-tone binary images. These halftone images 
can resemble the original images when viewed from a 
distance because of the low-pass nature of the human visual 
system. Halftoning is commonly used in computer printers, 
as well as printing books, newspapers, and magazines, 
because these printing processes can generate only two tones, 
black (with ink) and white (without ink). The two most 
popular halftone techniques include ordered dithering and 
error diffusion [2]-[4]. Of these, ordered dithering provides 
an efficient coding method and reasonable quality. The error 
diffusion method offers better visual quality, although it has 
the worm effect. In this study, we propose an LMS-designed 
halftoning (LDH) to produce sharper and higher quality 
halftone images than either ordered dithered or error 
diffusion images. 
Recently, secret data hiding in halftone images has 
become a significant research field that has many usages, 
including protecting ownership rights of an image, 
preventing the use of an image without permission, and 
authenticating an image to show that it has not been altered. 
Numerous methods using halftones to embed watermarks 
have been studied. These methods include using a number of 
different dither cells to create a threshold pattern in the 
halftoning process [5], using the concept of Vector 
Quantization (VQ) to embed watermarks into the most or 
least significant bit (MSB/LSB) of error diffusion images 
[6]-[7], using the technique of Modified Data Hiding Error 
Diffusion (MDHED) to embed data into error diffusion 
images [8], embedding a message into dithered images by 
using a pair of conjugate halftone screens [9], using smart 
pair-toggling (DHSPT) to embed data into error diffusion 
images [10], and adopting intensity selection and connection 
selection concept to put the embedded data in a suitable 
location [11]. In this part, we propose a high capacity and 
good image quality data hiding, named Direct Embedding 
LMS-designed Halftone technique (DELDH). The LMS 
halftoning inherently has the benefit of iteration 
optimization feature, which leads DELDH being able to 
offer high capacity and good image quality. An alternate 
embedding method is provided by embedding the visual 
patterns into two or more halftone images so that the hidden 
visual patterns can be perceived directly when the halftone 
images are overlaid on each other. These techniques include 
visual cryptography [12], stochastic screen patterns [13], 
conjugate halftone screens [14] stochastic error diffusion 
[15], and noise-balanced error diffusion [16]-[17]. In Fu and 
Au [15], the concept of making a different phase version of 
stochastic error diffusion image to achieve the data hiding 
technique is adopted. However, poor contrast of the hidden 
pattern in the high texture region of error diffusion image 
was found. In Pei and Guo [16]-[17], the authors employed 
additive balanced noise strategy to arrange the white and 
black pixels in the second embedded halftone image in order 
to improve the overlaid contrast. However, the error 
diffusion inherently has the limitation of one pass processing, 
so the anticausal pixel value cannot be varied once it was 
determined. For this, we propose an iteration-based 
Information Sharing LMS-Designed Halftone technique 
(ISLDH). As shown in section V, the proposed ISLDH is 
able to achieve better image quality by using smaller 
additive noise value, and better visual decoded pattern 
contrast by iteration-based LMS optimization.  
 
2. LEAST-MEAN-SQUARE-DESIGNED HALFTONE 
TECHNIQUE 
The LMS-designed halftone technique can be discussed 
into two steps. The first step is the LMS Filter Constructed 
Procedure (LFCP) in order to derive the coefficients for the 
LMS filter, and the second step is the LMS Halftone 
Constructed Procedure (LHCP) processed by the developed 
LMS filter. 
The flow chart of the proposed LMS-designed halftone 
technique is depicted in Fig. 1, where the solid line stands 
for the LFCP in the first design step, and the dotted line 
indicates the LHCP in the second design step. The variables 
jig ,  and jih ,  represent the original gray level image and 
the corresponding halftone images, respectively, in position 
(i,j). The LFCP can be mathematically described as follows.

training database to obtain the LMS filter. 
 
 
3. SECRET DATA HIDING COORDINATING WITH 
LMS-DESIGNED HALFTONING 
In this section, we embed secret data into the proposed 
LMS-designed halftone images. There are two methods 
developed in this study, and are described as follows.  
The first one is illustrated in Fig. 6, and is referred to as 
the Direct Embedding LMS-designed Halftone technique 
(DELDH). The embedded data used here are in a binary bit 
stream. Because the encoding method directly embeds data, 
the pseudo random key shown in Fig. 6 is adopted to 
re-permute embedded data. The embedded data is distributed 
into the encoded initial halftone image then fed into the 
LHCP shown in Fig. 1. Note that during the iteration process, 
the pixel values in every data embedding positions can not 
be altered, and only the other pixel values could be varied 
between 0 and 1 by LMS optimization. From the 
experimental results, even though 16384 bits are embedded 
into a halftone image of size 512×512, the embedded data 
are still difficult to perceive. 
The second data hiding technique is illustrated in Fig. 7, 
and is referred to as the Information Sharing LMS-Designed 
Halftone technique (ISLDH). The encoding scheme embeds 
the desired data into an LDH image called LDH2. The 
decoding scheme superimposes LDH2 with the original 
LDH image, known as LDH1, and then the decoded 
watermark can be perceived directly from the two overlaid 
LDH images. 
We define WW  as the set of locations of all the “white” 
pixels in the watermark and BW  as the set of locations of 
all the “black” pixels. Similarly, WLDH )1( , BLDH )1( , 
WLDH )2( , BLDH )2(  are defined as above. If the 
following two conditions are both satisfied, the 
corresponding value in the original gray level image should 
be temporarily modified as Eq. (8).

Then this variable is substituted into LHCP to determine 
the corresponding value of LDH2. After the value in LDH2 
is determined, the variable jig ,′ returns to its original value 
by adding AN . If the following two conditions are satisfied 
simultaneously, the corresponding value in the original gray 
level image should be temporarily modified as Eq. (9).

If the value of AN  is increased, the quality of LDH2 
will degrade, while the decoded visual pattern will become 
clearer; the opposite will be true when the value of AN  is 
decreased. Superimposing LDH1 and LDH2 clearly reveal 
the watermark black region. In general, a better contrast can 
be obtained, when more LDH images are overlaid. In 
addition, LDH1 and LDH2 can be made from two totally 
different gray-tone images.  
Finally, the ISLDH technique can be generalized to a 
“self-decode” mode. The embedded pattern still can be 
visually decoded with only one LDH image. There are two 
extended methods to achieve the self-decoding, as follows. 
In the first self-decoding technique, referred to as 
“replicated self-decoding technique”, a small portion of 
original gray-level image is chosen and processed with 
ordinary LDH. The small LDH image is taken as LDH1 and 
is imagined to be replicated and tiled to be the same size as 
the original gray-tone image. In next step, the same ISLDH 
technique described above is applied to obtain LDH2. If the 
following two conditions are satisfied simultaneously, the 
corresponding value in the original gray level image should 
be temporarily modified as Eq. (10).

where the variables 1P  and 1Q  stand for the dimension 
of the LDH1. After the value in LDH2 is determined, the 
variable jig , returns to its original value by adding AN . If 
the following two conditions are satisfied simultaneously, 
the corresponding value in the original gray level image 
should be temporarily modified as Eq. (11).

When the LDH1 and LDH2 are superimposed, the visual 
pattern can be clearly seen. 
In the second self-decoding technique, referred to as 
“shifted self-decoding technique”, if the following two 
conditions are satisfied simultaneously, the corresponding 
value in the original gray level image should be temporarily 
modified as Eq. (12).

displacement, and (i- xD ,j- yD ) in LDH has been processed 
by ISLDH. After the value in LDH2 is determined, the 
variable jig , returns to its original value by adding AN . If 
the following two conditions are satisfied simultaneously, 
the corresponding value in the original gray level image
