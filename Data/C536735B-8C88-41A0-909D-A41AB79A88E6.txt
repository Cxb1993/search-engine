中文摘要 
利用表面電漿共振以偵測介面變化已廣泛應用在微脂體在分子動力學；藥劑結合之研
究；溶劑濃度的量測而無須顯示劑。 將一內全反射裝置放光彈調變式橢圓偏光儀的樣
品座上， 可增強橢圓偏光儀的解析率。 本計畫建議使用事後分析法來分研究快速的變
化，並製成一頻閃光彈調變式影像橢圓偏光儀，一測試系統使我們將發展重點放在起始
時間相位的校正。我們藉用液晶及厚鉑金膜的量測來確認頻閃光的時間相位。最後我們
也藉一小分子的結合與解離來了解我們系統的解析率。

Abstract 
The surface Plasmon resonance technique has been widely used in bio-sensing for kinetics of 
molecular binding; drug binding to the receptor; biologically active compound is in a 
production batch without labeling.  A prism is installed in the photoelastic modulation 
(PEM) ellipsometry to enhance the measurement in the resonance angle.  A novel 
stroboscopic illumination technique is applied in a photoelastic modulated (PEM) 
ellipsometry to conquer the slow imaging processing of charge-coupled device camera 
system and form a fast imaging ellipsometry. The synchronized ultra-stable short pulse is 
used to freeze the intensity variation of the PEM modulated signal. The two-dimensional 
ellipsometric parameters can be deduced from those recorded four images.  For accurately 
obtain the temporal phase in this imaging ellipsometry, the initial phase calibration is our 
major work in this report: the TNLC cell and a thick Pt film are used to illustrate the initial 
phase of the waveform. In the end of this project, we performed a nonspecific binding for a 
For solving ψ, Δ and Io, one only has to find three equations, but for the 
simplicity, 4 symmetric equations can be used: 
 
 
 
 
This four states can be proved to be: \ 45o linear polarized and R, L circular 
polarized light.  We measured the four state can also see the deviation of the 
initial states [9].

The δi is the initial phase of the photoelastic modulator.  In conventional PEM 
ellipsometry, the Fourier transform are used to measure the ellipsometric 
parameters.    
III. Experiment  
Three ellipsometric configurations were setup for this project: (a) transmission 
style, polarimetry, the TNLC as the sample; (b) reflection style, ellipsometry, the 
optical thick Pt film is used for the testing sample, its incident angle was set at 70o; 
(c) a prism was installed in the ellipsometry for nonspecific (Δ5-3-ketosteroid 
isomerase and 19- norandrostendione) bio-binding study, its resonance angle was set 
for surface Plasmon resonance.  The light source of this project is HeNe laser, a 
Hinds PEM is in this system for phase modulation.  The DAQ card is used for 
data acquisition and transfer to PC for waveform analysis.
