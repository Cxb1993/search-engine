and implement microwave filters begin with 
lumped-element prototypes. Richard’s 
transformation [2] and Kuroda’s identities [3] are 
then used to transform lumped-element values to 
the corresponding transmission-line circuits. 
Butterworth, Chebyshev and elliptical filters [1] 
are three popular prototypes used in filter design. 
Each of three has its distinct characteristic that 
meets specific application. The motivation of this 
work is to develop a design method that is used to 
implement a microwave filter for an arbitrarily 
defined frequency-domain response. In other 
words, filter responses of bandwidth, level and 
roll-off rate defined by designers can be 
implemented with the configuration of 
transmission lines for microwave application. 
The modified Yule-Walker equation [10]-[11] 
is commonly used in statistics for estimating the 
time domain parameters of an autoregressive 
process. But there is still no filter design using 
modified Yule-Walker equation. In this study, we 
use modified Yule-Walker scheme to express 
arbitrary response of filter. We begin with a filter 
having arbitrary frequency-domain response. The 
Yule-Walker scheme converts the arbitrary 
frequency-domain response into the filter response 
in the Z domain . To implement a filter with 
transfer function in the Z domain [12]-[14], an 
equal-length transmission-line configuration is 
proposed to emulate the scattering characteristic 
of filter. We present the chain scattering 
parameters of basic transmission lines including 
series line, shunt short stub, shunt open stub and 
two-section shunt open stub. Each 
transmission-line section is assumed to have the 
same electrical length so that the composition of 
transmission-line sections can be expressed in 
terms of Z parameters. The zero locations of filter 
function in the Z domain determine the 
configuration of transmission-line network. The 
implementation process of filter design is to adjust 
the characteristic impedances of transmission lines 
with simple optimization algorithms [7]. A 
band-pass filter, a dual-band band-pass filter, and 
a dual-level band-pass filter are implemented and 
their frequency responses are measured to 
illustrate the validity of this design method.

equations

B. Dual-Band Band-Pass Filter 
    Fig. 2 shows the amplitude response of a 
dual-band band-pass filter as a function of 
normalized frequencies. The amplitude responses 
are m = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] at the 
normalized frequencies f = [0, 0.35, 0.36, 0.44, 
0.45, 0.55, 0.56, 0.64, 0.65, 1].  Two pass-bands 
occur at 0.36-0.44 and 0.56-0.64. By the same 
token, as for the above band-pass filter, we obtain 
the system function of the dual-band band-pass  
filter, which is given as follows

shown as the dashed line in Fig. 2. |F2(z)| deviates 
slightly from the postulated arbitrarily dual-band 
band-pass filter. F2(z) is considered as the system 
function of the dual-band band-pass filter in the Z 
domain for the present consideration. 
C. Dual-Level Band-Pass Filter 
    We now consider a dual-level band-pass 
filter with amplitude responses as m = [0, 0, 1, 1, 
0.317, 0.317, 0, 0] at the normalized frequencies f 
= [0, 0.33, 0.375, 0.41, 0.43, 0.56, 0.57, 1]. As 
shown in Fig. 3, two pass-bands occur at 
0.375-0.41 and 0.43-0.56. In particular, two 
pass-bands represent a difference of 10dB in 
amplitude response. We then use Yule-Walker 
scheme to convert the frequency-domain response 
into the system function of filter in the Z domain. 
We obtain 
 
Fig. 4: A two-port network with incident and reflected 
waves. 
T12i ,T21i, T22i are the matrix elements representing 
the i-th element . If a transmission-line network 
consists of K two-section open stubs, L series 
lines, M short stubs, and N open stubs, the transfer 
function T11,network(z) of the overall network is  
shown in (6), where all di are real and are 
determined by the characteristic impedances of all 
transmission-line components. 
    When the output port of the cascade network 
is properly terminated, we have a(2) = 0. The 
transfer function T(z) of such a network becomes

is a function of the characteristic impedances of 
all components involved. Both system function 
Fi(z) (i = 1, 2, 3) of filter and transfer function T(z) 
of transmission-line network are expressed in 
terms of z parameters. In order to implement a 
filter with a transmission–line network, we set 
( ) ( )iF z T z= .             (9)                              
Notice that both Fi(z) and T(z) are autoregressive 
moving average processes. 
A shunt-open stub and a shunt-short stub 
contribute to zeros at z = -1 and z = 1, respectively. 
A shunt-open two-section stub contributes to 
conjugate-pair zeros which are given by 
2
0 1 ,z j= − ± −γ γ           (10) 
where γ is given in Table I.  Because of | γ | ≦ 
1.0, these two zeros are located on the unit circle 
in the complex z plane. These zeros occur at the 
normalized frequency ΩN given by  
1cos ( ).N
−Ω = −ϒ            (11) 
If the zeros in discrete-time prototype Fi(z) are the 
same as the zeros of transfer function T(z) in (7),  
the numerator terms in both (7) and (9) can be 
removed and  the following situation is obtained

where the term z-L/2 representing the propagation 
delay is neglected. Notice that Ai in (12) is a 
function of characteristic impedances while ah is 
the coefficient parameter of the discrete-time 
prototype filter. As a result, the synthesis method 
of a filter is to adjust the characteristic impedances 
of transmission lines by using optimization 
algorithms [7] so that ah and Ai are as close as 
possible in the sense of least-mean-square error.  
In other words, if the coefficient difference 
between ah and Ai is small enough, it ensures that 
the frequency response of  T(z) can trace that of Fi(z)

pole-zero locations of (13a) after the removal of 
the zero not located on the unit circle. Notice that 
the amplitude response of (13a) is the same as 
those of both (13) and (1). The modified system 
function of (13a) is employed to implement the 
band-pass filter by using equal-length 
transmission lines. Fig. 7 shows the configuration 
of transmission-line network used to synthesize 
the filter, of which K = 2, L = 9, M = 3, and N = 3. 
There are two two-section open stubs, namely, 
(Z2(1), Z1(1)) and (Z2(2), Z1(2)), which are used to 
implement transmission zeros at P-P′ and  Q-Q′, 
respectively [7], in Fig. 6. Notice that zeros P-P′ 
and Q-Q′ are corresponding to zeros 0.78 π and 
0.215 π , respectively, in Fig. 1. Three 
one-section short stubs and three one-section open

stubs are used to produce transmission zeros at 
DC and  π, respectively.  
Upon using the requirement set by both (12) 
and optimization process [7], we obtain the 
characteristic impedances of transmission lines. 
The characteristic impedances of open stubs, from 
the left side to the right side in Fig. 7, are 52.58, 
160, and 160 ohms. Three short stubs have 
impedance profile, from left side to right side, as 
40.5, 50.5, and 160 ohms.  The characteristic 
impedances of two two-section stubs are (Z2 (1) = 
71.3 ohms, Z1(1) = 540.5 ohms) and (Z2(2) = 160 
ohms, Z1(2) = 20.8 ohms). In addition, the 
characteristic impedances of nine series lines, 
from the left side to the right side, are 47.98, 22.93, 
33.41, 21.61, 65.32, 77.58, 81.87, 100.33, and 
62.77 ohms. Z2 (1) and Z1(1) are two-section stub 
used to implement the transmission zero at 0.78 
π. The characteristic impedance of Z1(1) = 540.5 
ohms is not realizable in microstrip format. We 
may use the frequency-bandwidth-impedance 
relations of notch filter [6] to change the 
characteristic impedances of this two-section open 
stub without affecting the scattering characteristic 
of transmission-line network. The relations

which K = 3, L = 11, M = 3,  and N = 3. There
