stream fragments. Another is that group users have more chances to receive expected stream data. Specifically, we consider
a discrete time system and fading channel models, where the BS has perfect channel state information and the sequence
number of a multicast stream data expected to start by each group user. Derived from these pairs of information, there is a
set of triplets of user receiver states on feasible peak transmission rate, expected sequence number, and information lag from
a leading expected sequence number. Using a utility function based on the set of triplet information, the single layer coded
transmission and sequential data receiving constraints, and the requirement of limiting group information lags, we pose the
multicast scheduling problem as a utility function optimization problem.
For each time slot, our method is to choose from the set of user triplet states an expected sequence number and a feasible peak
rate which jointly maximize a utility function and send a fragment of multicast stream starting from the expected sequence
number at the peak rate. The key to efficient multicasting thus entirely relies on the utility function. We propose a utility
function taking into account three factors. One is the total number of expected multicast data received by each group user in
a slot, which excludes duplicated or out-of-sequence data. We call this number an effective broadcast volume (eBV). If the
eBV is the only component of a utility function, the scheduling policy is greedy for throughput but only reduced to taping
multiuser diversity gain because expected sequence numbers generally spread out over time. Another factor is thus a force to
push expected sequence numbers to drift closely, i.e. to limit information lags. This is realized through an exponential weight
of information lag. For the fact that the best opportunity for broadcast gain occurs when all expected sequence numbers are
synchronized, the other factor is hence an extra-force to draw more users for synchronization in expected sequence numbers.
This is realized through another exponential weight of the number of served users.
To investigate the performance of our scheme and the effect of the two types of force above, we assume that all channel
fading processes of a multicast group are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In analysis, we’ll show that without
the two forces, our scheme is reduced only to tapping multiuser diversity gain and that with the first force above, optimal
throughput asymptotically increases linearly with group size. In simulation, we will first consider χ22 and χ26 SNR distributions,
in order to see the effect of using one or multiple receive antennas in Rayleigh fading channels. We then allow antenna transmit
power to be adjustable according to a waterfilling power control algorithm and study its effect. We will focus on χ22 SNR
distributions with 0, 6, and 12 dB means, respectively, in order to further look into how the proposed scheme reacts when
group users have different path loss of power.
The remainder of the report is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the system model related to broadcast capacity,
antenna power allocation, and the capacity by fixed transmit power. We also define measures for multicast stream data and
for multicasting. Section III formulates and presents our multicast scheduling algorithm. Here we also introduce a waterfilling
algorithm for antenna power control. The algorithm is used in the study of its effect later on. In Section IV, we discuss
performance characteristics based on analysis. Section V presents numerical and simulation results along with discussions.
Finally, we conclude in Section VI with a brief discussion.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Broadcast channel and capacity
Consider a wideband wireless system where the BS of a cell requires to deliver a multicast information stream to a group of
m users in the cell and the forward link to each user is a time-varying fading channel. Without loss of generality, we assume
a discrete time system. Let s[n] be a transmitted symbol with average power Pn at time n, yi[n] the symbol received by user
i, and hi[n] the channel gain observed by user i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The baseband forward link channel from the BS to user
i can be represented by
yi[n] = hi[n]s[n] + wi[n]
where wi[n] is additive noise, assumed to be independent and identically circular symmetric complex Gaussian with zero mean
and variance N0.
Assume that the channel process {hi[n]} is stable during each slot time, that the state information of hi[n] is available for
user i to decode s[n] from yi[n], and that there is no intercell interference. The channel capacity for user i at time n is then
log(1 +
Pn|hi[n]|
2
No
) nats/sec/Hz. (1)
Assume that the BS has full knowledge of current channel state information {hi[n]; i = 1, 2, · · · ,m} and uses all allocated
transmit power Pn every time to send a fragment of multicast stream in a single layer code at a feasible peak transmission
rate. We use (1), the maximum achievable information transmission rate without delay constraint, as the peak rate if user i’s
channel is chosen as the broadcast channel[11] at time n. All user j with better channel quality, |hj [n]| > |hi[n]|, is assumed
to successfully receive the fragment in slot n simultaneously.
Let (1), (2), · · · , (m) be a permutation of 1, 2, · · · ,m such that |h(1)[n]| > |h(2)[n]| > · · · > |h(m)[n]|. The sequence
{h(i)[n]; i = 1, 2, · · · ,m} is then in decreasing order of channel quality. If data are coded and transmitted at the peak rate of
2
By the law of large numbers, the broadcast capacity (4) for time-independent choice of k˜ ∈ {1, 2, · · · ,m} is
R(P
∗,k˜) = E
[
k˜ log(1 +
P ∗(k˜,h(k˜)) |h(k˜)|
2
No
)
]
nats/sec/Hz. (10)
Thus, R(P∗,m) and R(P∗,1) are the broadcast capacity of MinPTR and MaxPTR, respectively. As to the strategy of maximizing
broadcast volume (i.e. rate-user product), called MaxBV for short, find
k∗ = arg max
1≤k≤m
k log(1 +
P ∗(k,h(k)) |h(k)|
2
No
)
and then again use k˜ = k∗ in (9) that determines a transmit power level for the current slot time. The broadcast capacity of
MaxBV is thus R(P∗,k∗).
C. Fixed transmit power P
Consider that the BS antenna transmit power level is fixed at P . The objective function (2) can be expressed as a sum of
independent samples and by the law of large numbers, is reduced to
max
{k˜[n];n=1,2,···,t}
t∑
n=1
k˜[n]

log(1 +
P |h(k˜)[n]|

as t→∞
= R(P,k
∗).
Again R(P,k∗), R(P,1) and R(P,m) are the broadcast capacity of MaxBV, MaxPTR, and MinPTR strategies, respectively.
D. Multicast stream and related measures
The time slot is assumed to have ∆ seconds. Let xi[n] be the feasible peak transmission rate for user or channel i at time n,
assumed to be log(1+ Pn |hi[n]|
2
No
) nats/sec/Hz as in (1). The amount of data carried at this rate in time n is xi[n] (∆ nats/Hz).
The variable xi[n] thus denotes a feasible peak rate as well as the volume of stream data carried in a slot. Let {x(i)[n]}
represent a permutation of {xi[n]} in nonincreasing order. All subscripts in the form (i) will refer to the user with x(i).
We use ∆nats/Hz as a unit of measurement. Assume that the BS maintains a list of m sequence numbers {bi[n]; i =
1, 2, · · · ,m} where each number, say bi[n], points to the data unit of a multicast stream from which user i expects to receive
at time n. This also implies that at the beginning of time n, user i has already received all stream data with sequence numbers
less than bi[n]. Let the data of a multicast stream begin at sequence number zero. Initially, bi[0] = bi[1] = 0 ∆nats/Hz for all
i. The expected sequence number bi[n] will increase with n. The throughput of a multicast scheduling policy A for a group
of m users is defined as
ρA = lim
n→∞
∑m
i=1 bi[n+ 1]
n
nats/sec/Hz. (11)
The information lag between user i and a leading user at the beginning of time n, denoted by li[n], is
li[n] = max
1≤j≤m
bj [n]− bi[n] ∆nats/Hz. (12)
We say that policy A is stable if there exists a finite c > 0 such that
Pr{lim sup
n→∞
li[n] > c} = 0 ∀ i ; (13)
Otherwise, it is unstable.
4
In system where it is not guaranteed that a user, say i, with channel quality |hi[n]| > |hk∗ [n]| will successfully decode a
transmitted fragment, the reliability of expected sequence numbers can be strengthened by requiring each receiver to timely
send feedback on which sequence number is expected next.
C. Implementation of waterfilling power allocation
If antenna transmit power is adjustable but subject to the constraint of average power P , the BS scheduling system needs
to allocate a power level Pn for current slot n so that the set of feasible peak data rate {xi[n]; i ∈ [1,m]} is available for
computation. We use (6) rather than (9) to determine such a power level, which however necessitates resolving the required
Lagrangian parameter λ first. We can calculate λ directly from (8) if there is prior knowledge on the statistics of channel
fading process {|hi|}. Instead, we estimate λ from the past history of allocated power level Pt, t < n.
Essentially, power level Pn for current slot n is computed from (6) where the unknown constant λ is replaced by the latest
estimate λ[n]. Then a monitored average of allocated power, denoted by p˜[n], is updated. According to power allocation error
p˜[n]− P , the required parameter λ[n] is periodically adapted to closely track the unknown λ. This works as we observe from
(8) that an overestimate (underestimate) of λ results in lower (larger) mean allocated power. To obtain an accurate estimate of
unknown λ is thus to reduce power allocation errors.
Specifically, we use a closed-loop system with a feedback loop where the system input is a constant P , the output is Pn, a
monitored average power p˜[n] = (1 − ζ)p˜[n− 1] + ζPn is on the feedback loop, and every W slots the resultant normalized
error
p˜[n]−P
P is obtained and old estimate λ[n] is updated by a factor (1+θ
p˜[n]−P
P ). Here ζ ∈ [0, 1] is an exponential smoothing
constant, and θ > 0 a sensitivity controller. We set W = 600, ζ = 0.001, and θ = 0.125 for all simulations in this work. The
details of waterfilling power allocation algorithm are as follows:
Give some initial values to λ[1] and p˜[0].
At the beginning of n = 1.
While(n ≥ 1) {
Calculate Pn from (6) with λ = λ[n] in accordance with a chosen broadcast strategy.
{Schedule and send a fragment [bj∗ [n], bj∗ [n] + xk∗ [n]) of multicast stream according to a chosen policy.}
Update monitored average power at the end of time n by
p˜[n] = (1 − ζ) p˜[n− 1] + ζ Pn .
If current time n is divisible by W (i.e. n%W equals 0), adjust the estimate of Lagrangian constant by
λ[n+ 1] = λ[n]
(
1 + θ
p˜[n]− P
P
)
;
else keep using the latest estimate by setting λ[n+ 1] = λ[n].
n←− n+ 1 .

IV. PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
In this section, we investigate the characteristics of each scheduling policy with regard to multicast throughput and stability
as defined in Section II-D. We start with basic policies MaxPTR and MinPTR in Propositions 1 and 2, respectively. We then
focus on our policies, MaxeBV for (αm = 0, βm = 0) and MaxLWeBV/MaxLGeBV for (αm > 0, βm = 0/βm > 0). Here
we’ll first show that MaxeBV is unstable for group size m = 2 as stated in Lemma 1 and conjecture that this also holds for
m > 2. This leads us to conclude that MaxeBV behaves asymptotically as MaxPTR does and hence ρMaxeBV → R(P
∗,1)
.
We establish Proposition 3 that MaxLWeBV/MaxLGeBV is stable, with achievable multicast throughput bounded above by
R(P
∗,k∗)
, the capacity of MaxBV. To be specific, we then restrict channel fading characteristics to Rayleigh and antenna
transmit power to a fixed level, present a finer throughput upper bound, and finally introduce recursive formulas for computing
the upper bound.
Recall that all channel processes are assumed i.i.d. across time and users. Suppose that antenna power is allocated independent
of time as mentioned in Section II. Then, peak transmit rates xi[n] ∀i ∈ [1,m], n > 0 are i.i.d. random variables. Thereafter,
we will use the conventional notation Xi[n] instead. Recall the definition X(1)[n] ≥ X(2)[n] ≥ ... ≥ X(m)[n]. We assume
that all expected sequence numbers are initially synchronized, with bi[1] = 0 ∀i. The first property below relates to policy
MaxPTR:
Proposition 1: (i) ρMaxPTR = R(P∗,1) (or R(P,1) for fixed transmit power P ); (ii) For group size m ≥ 2, the policy of
MaxPTR is unstable.

SNR distributions are plotted, with those for Γ(3, 1/3) tagged with G3. The “UpperBound” is obtained according to Corollary 1.
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Different SNR distribution
We first examine the throughput of each multicast policy for a data stream transmitted at a fixed power level over i.i.d.
Rayleigh fading channels. To see how it is affected by the variation of received SNR, we consider two types of SNR distribution,
Γ(1, 1), or χ22, and Γ(3, 1/3), or χ26. The former arises from using one receive antenna at the receiver. The latter may arise from,
for example, using three receive antennas that are spaced sufficiently far apart to provide three independent diversity branches
for coherent combining at the receiver[13]. For comparison, the latter case has been set to have mean SNR of 0 dB rather
than 4.77 dB and hence only gives one third of the variance of the former. All group users have the same SNR distribution.
Multicast throughputs (nats/sec/Hz) as a function of group sizes in the mentioned scenarios are shown in Fig. 1, where
the tag G3 denotes the case of Γ(3, 1/3) SNR distribution. Those for MaxLWeBV(G3) and MaxLGeBV(G3) are obtained by
simulations and optimizations of (αm, βm) in (15) for each group size m. The “UpperBound” ρMaxLGeBV ≤ E[maxk k+12 X(k)]
in corollary 1 of section IV is also plotted as denoted in the figure, although only proved for exponential rate distribution.
As we can see from Fig. 1, with mechanisms for exploiting broadcast gains, MinPTR, MaxLWeBV, and MaxLGeBV all
achieve higher multicast throughput in Γ(3, 1/3) SNR distribution than in Γ(1, 1) one, since less deep fade events, less variations
of SNR among group users, and hence more potential broadcast gains exist in the case of Γ(3, 1/3) SNR. We also see that
MaxLGeBV performs the best in both SNR distributions and outperforms MaxLWeBV more significantly in Γ(3, 1/3) SNR
distribution than in Γ(1, 1) one. These reflect that taking into account the additional weight factor eβmu[n] as introduced in
subsection III-A3, MaxLGeBV is more flexible and efficient for tapping radio broadcast gain. On the other hand, the figure
shows that MinPTR by exploiting radio broadcast gain to the utmost performs almost as well as MaxLGeBV does if SNR
is distributed as Γ(3, 1/3). This reveals a tradeoff between advanced receiver structures and efficient transmission scheduling.
However, MaxLGeBV is reduced to MinPTR for some αm < ∞ and βm → ∞ if all expected stream data are initially
synchronized.
B. Near-far groups
Next we study the effect of near-far groups as well as the impact of waterfilling (WF) power allocation subject to an
average power constraint. We consider that each group user uses one receive antenna and that each user’s channel is Rayleigh
distributed with the same mean of channel gain. We set 0dB, 6dB, and 12dB mean SNR for a group of users far, halfway, and
near to the BS, respectively. Multicast throughputs as a function of group sizes are shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b) for 0dB and
12dB mean SNR cases, respectively. The ratios of multicast throughput, ρMaxLGeBV/ρMinPTR, are plotted in Fig 3, on the
basis that the throughput of MinPTR is viewed as a baseline for comparison. Particularly for MaxLGeBV and group size 24,
Fig. 4 shows the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of chosen transmission rates and that of scaled-down chosen rates for
6dB and 12dB mean SNR cases. The average information lag (∆ nats/Hz) by MaxLGeBV is plotted in Fig. 5. The tag WF
in the figures indicates that waterfilling power allocation is performed. Note that all results above for MaxLGeBV( WF) and
MaxLWeBV( WF) are obtained by simulations and optimizations with additional steps according to the method presented in
III-C for those policies involving waterfilling power allocation.
For fair comparison, the plots in Figs. 2(a) and (b) should be separately divided by their channel mean data rate. Alternatively,
we can compare a chosen point in Fig. 2(a) with the corresponding point in Fig. 2(b) multiplied by a factor of E[log(1 +
