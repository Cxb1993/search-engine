Abstract 
 
Oxidative degradation of dinitrotoluenes (DNTs) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) 
in wastewater was conducted using ultrasonic irradiation combined with UV/TiO2, 
wherein a synergistic effect is observed. The batch-wise experiments were carried out 
to elucidate the influence of various operating parameters on the sonophotocatalytic 
behavior, including ultrasonic power intensity, TiO2 dosage, reaction temperature and 
oxygen dosage. It is remarkable that the nitrotoluene contaminants could be almost 
completely eliminated by virtue of sonophotocatalysis, wherein TiO2 serves as both 
photocatalysts and nuclei, leading to enhancement of cavitation bubble numbers. 
Based on the result given by pyrolysis/gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer 
(Pyrolysis/GC-MS), it is postulated that DNTs adsorbed on TiO2 preliminarily 
undergo denitration pathway into o-mononitrotoluene (MNT) or oxidation pathway 
into 1,3-dinitrobenzene (DNB), respectively. Further, according to the spectra 
obtained from GC-MS, it is proposed that DNTs existed in wastewater proceed with 
similar reaction pathways as those adsorbed on TiO2. Besides, sonophotocatalytic 
degradation of 2,4,6-TNT results in the formation of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB). 
Transparently, the sonophotocatalytic technique is promising for direct treatment of 
wastewater from TNT manufacturing process.

1. Introduction 
Nitration of toluene into dinitrotoluene (DNT) and trinitrotoluene (TNT) has 
gained much attention due to the industrial importance of DNTs and 2,4,6-TNT, 
which are widely used as precursors of dyes, paints, synthetic leather and explosives, 
respectively [1]. Conventionally, the aromatics nitration reaction is carried out by 
nitrating acid, consisting of a mixture of nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. In 
the toluene nitration process, the raw nitrotoluene product decanted from the settler 
would be violently blended with alkaline aqueous solution to partially neutralize 
entrained sulfuric and nitric acids. Subsequently, the residual contaminants in 
 4
pathways of DNTs and 2,4,6-TNT adsorbed on TiO2 or existed in aqueous solution 
were also explored, respectively.  
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Sonophotocatalytic testing 
Figure 1 depicts the schematic illustration of the experimental apparatus. 
Ultrasonic irradiation was supplied by an ultrasonic generator (Chrom Technol. 
UP-800 Model), which was coupled with a transducer at a frequency of 20 kHz and a 
titanium probe ( 13 mm x 60 mm). The reactor was a double jacket cylinder 
equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Twelve lamps (8 W each) with low-pressure mercury 
vapor inside were used as the light source at the wavelength of 254 nm (SANKYO 
Germicidal Lamps). Prior to tests, proportionate amounts of industrial wastewater 
(700 mL, pH 0.2) and TiO2 powder (Degussa P-25, analytical grade ) were situated in 
the reactor and kept good suspension, wherein the temperature of wastewater was 
maintained at 288  0.5 K using a thermostat connected with a circulating water bath. 
During sonophotocatalytic tests, oxygen gas monitored utilizing the mass flow meter 
was introduced into the wastewater by way of a porous pipe-diffuser. In this research, 
experiments were performed in a batch-wise mode with various ultrasonic power 
intensity of 60 W cm-2, 110 W cm-2, 160 W cm-2 and 210 W cm-2 (as quoted by the 
manufacturer). For the duration of sonophotocatalytic tests, the wastewater was 
periodically withdrawn from the reactor and undergone total organic compounds 
(TOC) analyses to obtain the residual organic compound contents.  
In order to explore the influence of TiO2 dosage on the elimination of 
nitrotoluenes, four tests with different concentrations of TiO2 powder (0 mg L-1 up to 
4000 mg L-1) were performed. In another set of experiments, four tests with a variety 
of reaction temperature (288 K up to 318 K) were carried out. Additionally, for the 
purpose of disclosing the effect of oxygen dosage on the destruction of nitrotoluenes, 
a series of tests with oxygen flow rates of 100 mL min-1 up to 300 mL min-1 were 
conducted.  
2.2. Total organic compounds analysis (TOC) 
In the course of sonophotocatalytic tests, the wastewater was periodically 
withdrawn and measured using a TOC analyzer (Tekmar Dohrmann Phoenix 8000 
Model) equipped with both ultra-violet (UV) reactor and nondispersive infrared 
(NDIR) detector. Prior to analyses, the samples were centrifuged at a rate of 3000 rpm 
for 30 min (HERMLE Z300 Model) and filtrated to separate TiO2 powder. The 
samples were directly analyzed without diluting to meet the measuring ranges (0200 
mg L-1), calibrated by the potassium hydrogen phthalate standard solution. 
2.3. Gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer analysis (GC-MS) 
 6
powder were determined utilizing a laser mastersizer (Brookhaven Instrument Co. 
90Plus Model), wherein measurements were conducted in triplicate to verify the 
reliability of data.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Effect of ultrasonic power intensity on sonophotocatalysis 
Based on the analysis of raw wastewater by GC-MS, the total components of 
organic compounds in wastewater from TNT manufacturing process have been 
identified as 2,6-DNT, 2,4-DNT, 3,4-DNT and 2,4,6-TNT (Table 1), wherein the TOC 
concentration was about 350 mg L-1. It has been well known that the power intensity 
is an important operating variable for ultrasonic engineering. Figure 2(a) demonstrates 
the time pattern of TOC removal percentage as a function of ultrasonic power 
intensity. From this figure, it can be seen that photocatalysis (ultrasonic power = 0) 
has little effect on the destruction of nitrotoluenes. Additionally, the degradation rate 
of nitrotoluenes increases proportionately with an increase in ultrasonic power 
intensity, reaches a maximum at about 110 W cm-2 and then decreases upon increasing 
the intensity further. The observation could be interpreted with transparent elevation 
in the number of cavitation bubbles, close to the probe emitting surface, due to sharp 
increase of power intensity. The considerable amount of tiny bubbles would coalesce 
to form larger bubbles, cavitating less violently than those of tiny bubbles. Therefore, 
it would lead to lower energy efficiency and formation of fewer amounts of hydroxyl 
radicals and/or hydrogen peroxide at the power intensity of 210 W cm-2 (refer to Fig. 
2 (b)). Consequently, in this work the optimal ultrasonic power intensity of 110 W 
cm-2 was chosen for subsequent sonophotocatalytic tests.  
3.2. Effect of TiO2 dosage on sonophotocatalysis 
For the purpose of enhancing removal efficiency of nitrotoluenes, the 
sonophotocatalysis with optimal concentration of TiO2 is necessary to the treatment of 
wastewater. Figure 3(a) illustrates the influence of TiO2 dosage on the 
sonophotocatalytic behavior. It clearly indicates that the nitrotoluene removal 
percentage exhibits an increasing trend with an increment of TiO2 dosage, whereas 
higher dosage of TiO2 (≧ 4000 mg L-1) is conflicting. A similar trend is observed 
between the TOC removal efficiency and the hydrogen peroxide concentration, 
produced by cavitation bubbles (see Fig. 3(b)). It implies that the presence of TiO2 
powders gives rise to formation of more cavitation bubbles except for higher TiO2 
concentrations. This phenomenon may be attributed to the following interpretations. 
Firstly, it could be partially explained with the significant enhancement on the number 
of cavitation bubbles due to the presence of additional nuclei provided by TiO2 
powders [20]. Another evidence is given by the comparison of TOC removal 
 8
of oxygen on the sonophotocatalytic behavior. It clearly shows that the TOC removal 
percentage increases significantly with an increase of oxygen flow rate. Besides, it is 
remarkable that the nitrotoluenes in wastewater could be almost completely 
eliminated under the conditions of ultrasonic power intensity = 110 W cm-2, T = 288 
K, UV light intensity = 96 W, TiO2 = 3000 mg L-1 and O2 = 300 mL min-1. The results 
may be partially ascribed to the extra generation of hydroxyl radicals, arisen from 
dissociation of molecular oxygen in the cavitation bubbles, which are likely to 
recombine to form hydrogen peroxide at the gas-liquid interface of the bubbles [24]: 
 OO 22                                                          (1) 
 HOOHO 22                                                 (2) 
222 OHHO                                                       (3) 
In order to verify the formation of extra hydroxyl radicals and/or hydrogen 
peroxide, which have been proved to be effective for mineralization of DNTs and 
2,4,6-TNT previously [25], sonophotocatalytic experiments were performed except 
for the absence of nitrotoluenes. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the hydrogen peroxide 
concentration produced in deionized water (pH 0.2) increases gradually with 
increasing oxygen dosage. The yield of hydrogen peroxide at the oxygen flow rate of 
300 mL min-1 under sonophotocatalysis of 8 h reaches to a value as high as 30 mg L-1, 
whereas it could simply abate some nitrotoluenes in bulk solution in comparison with 
total amounts of nitrotoluenes removed (i.e. 350 mg L-1). It is likely that DNTs and 
2,4,6-TNT in wastewater were principally destructed by way of pyrolysis and 
hydroxyl radical oxidation. Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 enhanced 
by oxygen gas would make a partial contribution for elimination of nitrotoluenes. 
Oxygen molecules may scavenge electrons of conduction band in preventing the 
recombination of electron-hole pairs as well as in the formation of active oxygen 
radicals such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals on the TiO2 surface [22]. 
3.5. Reaction pathways of nitrotoluenes under sonophotocatalysis 
Upon considering the reaction pathway for sonophotocatalytic degradation of 
nitrotoluenes in the presence of TiO2, it may be divided into two sections. Firstly, 
some nitrotoluenes adsorbed on TiO2 would be destructed through hydroxyl radicals 
which are derived from surface reations of water molecules and positive holes 
induced by UV ligth. To disclose the degradation intermediates in the course of 
sonophotocatalytic oxidation, the TiO2 powders withdrawn were analyzed utilizing a 
Pyrolysis/GC-MS spectrometer. Table 1 summarizes the results obtained, wherein the 
compositions include benzene, toluene, o-mononitrotoluene(MNT), 
1,3-dinitrobenzene(DNB), 2,6-DNT and 2,4-DNT. As regards the components of 
2,6-DNT and 2,4-DNT, they may be ascribed to the nitrotoluene feedstock in 
wastewater. Nonetheless, within nitrotoluene feedstock there wasn’t any MNT to be 
 10
 
4. Conclusions 
Based on the above discussion, it is obvious that DNTs and 2,4,6-TNT in 
wastewater undr sonophotocatalysis would be eliminated not only by TiO2 
photocatalysts, on which the nitrotoluenes are destructed through hydroxyl radicals, 
but also by cavitation bubbles, of which numbers are enhanced with addition of TiO2, 
wherein pyrolysis and hydroxyl radicals seem to be responsible for oxidative 
degradation of nitrotoluenes. Besides, it is deserved to note that nearly complete 
destruction of nitrotoluenes can be achieved under the optimal conditions of ultrasonic 
power intensity = 110 W cm-2, T = 288 K, UV light intensity = 96 W, TiO2 = 3000 mg 
L-1 and O2 = 300 mL min-1. It convinces us that sonophotocatalysis coupled with TiO2 
is a potential method for treatment of nitrotoluenes in industrial wastewater. In 
accordance with the spectra given by Pyrolysis/GC-MS analyses, the plausible 
degradation pathways of nitrotoluenes adsorbed on TiO2 are suggested as follows. 
DNTs preliminarily undergo denitration into o-MNT or oxidation into 1,3-DNB, 
respectively. On the basis of spectra analyzed by GC-MS spectrometer, DNTs 
dissolved in aqueous solution seem to proceed with similar reaction pathway as those 
adsorbed on TiO2 surface. Further, the sonophotocatalytic degradation of 2,4,6-TNT 
gives rise to formation of 1,3,5-TNB. Eventually, the mineralization of nitrotoluenes 
leads to carbon dioxide, nitrate ions and water.
