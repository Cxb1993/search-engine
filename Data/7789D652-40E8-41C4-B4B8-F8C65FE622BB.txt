Abstract 
The main purpose of the present study is to establish numerical viscous free-surface flow models 
to solve the nonlinear water wave problems using a projection method. The viscous flow model 
presented is based on the Navier-Stokes equations with a free-surface obtained through the 
arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian velocity-pressure formulation. Those equations together with 
imposed fully nonlinear free-surface boundary conditions are solved by a finite element method 
with the help of boundary-fitted coordinate system. To demonstrate the model feasibility, the 
model is applied to a solitary wave passing over a submerged rectangular structure and rigid 
rippled beds in inviscid and viscous fluids. This study may lead to a better understanding of 
viscous free-surface flows in velocity-pressure formulation.

z INTRODUCTION 
Free-surface flows find wide applications for the design of breakwaters and offshore 
structures in the ocean engineering. The last decade has envisaged growing importance placed on 
research in free-surface flow simulations. Many analytical methods have been developed to solve 
traveling and standing water wave problems associated with inviscid fluids [1, 2] as well as for 
the solutions of linear or low order nonlinear problems. The head-on and overtaking collisions of 
solitary wave propagations in shallow water channel are the classical nonlinear water wave 
spline approximation is used to recover the velocity. Several examples of the nonlinear wave 
waves with the submerged obstacles were investigated in detail therein.  
  The numerical treatments of free-surface flow problems involve the tracking of the moving 
free-surface boundary during the flow transients. The arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) 
coordinate system [16] is used to track the free-surface position on the moving boundary and 
solve the interior computational domain at each time step. It is important to keep the computation 
of a free-surface position in perspective. In our study, the nodal points can be arbitrarily 
controlled in order to get finer grid distribution during computations without grid distortion and 
overlapping problems. 
This study is the attempt at an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian velocity-pressure formulation 
with the viscous free-surface flows by a finite element method with the help of boundary-fitted 
coordinate system. In this work, we assume that adjacent fluids are impermeable at the interface 
with constant density and viscosity. On the free-surface, a particle on the surface must remain on 
the surface itself. Further, we assume that the surface pressure is assumed to be constant and 
tangential stress is zero. The main difficulties of the solutions for the viscous, incompressible 
free-surface flows lie in the fact that the free-surface kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions 
(FSKBC and FSDBC) are not known a priori. For the case of the free-surface flows, the problem 
is a difficult issue in regard with treating the pressure term in the momentum equations. A number 
of studies often have difficulty dealing the pressure term in the momentum equations. However, 
we proposed an alternative methodology based on velocity-pressure formulation and its 
application to the simulation of wave-wave and wave-structure interaction problems. In the 
passing through the submerged structure in the viscous free-surface flow model.  
Figure 4 shows the streamlines plotted to illustrate the vortex motion generated during the 
wave-structure interaction process, and Figure 5 gives the local velocity distribution near the 
submerged structure. The present numerical study clearly predicts the gradual development of the 
recirculating flow regimes at the downstream of the submerged structure. Figure 5 depicts the 
comparison of inviscid and viscous free-surface flow models for the solutions of local velocity 
distributions. A conspicuous recirculating gyre generated at the trailing edge of the submerged 
structure was clearly observed in the viscous flow model. However, no recirculating flow pattern 
was found for the inviscid flow model. The results reflected in Figure 5 indicate that the viscosity 
and vorticity play very important roles in the generation of vertical flow at the trailing edge of the 
submerged structure. In general, the vortical flow always grows up on the rear surface of the solid 
structure while the solitary wave passes through the submerged structure in a viscous fluid. 
Following two points are worth making about this case study. 
1. The analysis of both inviscid and viscous free-surface flow models revealed that there were big 
differences in recirculating flow pattern. The vortex motion generated during wave-structure 
interactive process shows that the significant difference was observed between viscous flow 
model on the one hand and inviscid flow model on the other hand. 
2. The profile of free-surface elevation (Figure 3) indicates that there is very similar trend for 
both the inviscid and viscous flow models, as far as free-surface calculation is concerned. 
b. A solitary wave passing over rigid rippled beds 
To verify the capability of the model to handle complex geometries, a solitary wave over 2D rigid 
different times as a solitary wave of wave height 0.4, and still water depth 1 passing over rigid 
ripples for case 6 was shown in Figure 7. For the cases 4 and 6, the comparisons of instantaneous 
velocity field over the whole rippled bed at three instants induced by a solitary wave of wave 
height 0.4 was shown in Figure 8. The obtained results of flow pattern can be well captured as 
depicted in Figure 8. Figure 7-8 illustrate that the flows become more complex as the thin 
boundary layer developed near boundary wall of the rigid ripples. In addition, to demonstrate that 
present model has capable to simulate the free-surface elevation, the free-surface elevations of a 
solitary wave passes the rigid ripples by treating the flow fields in viscous flow as shown in 
Figure 9. From above results obtained, the model has been successfully applied to simulate a 
solitary wave over rigid rippled beds, which demonstrates the capability to deal with 2D complex 
geometries.
