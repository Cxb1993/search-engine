The liquefaction potential assessment under the framework of simplified procedure 
that involves the use of cone penetration tests (CPT) typically relies on empirical 
correlations between the soil cyclic resistance ratio, CRR and cone tip resistance qt.  
For sands that contain fines (particles passing #200 sieve), an adjustment based on 
fines content in the CRR-qt correlation is called for in currently available procedures.  
Earlier laboratory calibration tests in reconstituted silty sand specimens performed by 
the authors have indicated that partial drainage in CPT played an important role in the 
CRR-qt correlations.  A series of laboratory tests on undisturbed samples and field 
piezocone penetration tests (CPTU) were carried out in an alluvial soil deposit at two 
test sites in Central and Southern Taiwan.  The results indicated that unlike the 
uniformly mixed specimens reconstituted in laboratory, the tested natural alluvial 
silt/sand soils can be heterogeneous with closely spaced clean sand layers embedded 
in a matrix of silty material.  This stratification can render the CPTU a drained test 
even at fines contents well in excess of 50%.  The ignorance of free draining effects 
on CPTU due to stratification in alluvial soils may lead to overestimation of CRR.  
Because of these factors, calibration of the CRR-qt correlations by performing tests in 
local soil and field procedures to ascertain the drainage conditions in CPTU are 
important to the proper application of the CRR-qt correlations in the liquefaction 
potential assessment.

INTRODUCTION 
Earlier studies on the behavior of granular materials have been biased towards clean, 
uniformly graded sands.  Natural sands often contain various amounts of fines 
(particles passing #200 sieve).  Experience shows that mineral contents, grain shapes 
and plasticity of the fines are important contributing factors to the mechanical behavior 
of sand that contains fines (Ishihara, 1993; and Lade et al., 1998).  Limited by the 
difficulties of taking undisturbed samples in cohesionless soils, the existing studies 
4 
 
The associated CRR-qt1N correlations for clean sands have been established according 
to field observations.  Although different in magnitude and/or format, it has been 
suggested separate sets of CRR-qt1N correlations should be used for sands with fines 
(Stark and Olson, 1995).  Alternatively, the qt1N should be adjusted to an equivalent 
clean sand value, (qt1N)cs before invoking the CRR-(qt1N)cs correlation (Robertson and 
Wride, 1998).   
Since no soil samples are taken in CPT, it is necessary to classify the soil type as a 
priori in order to determine the value of n for qt stress normalization and calculate 
(qt1N)cs.  Graphical, CPT-based soil classification charts have been developed (e.g., 
Olsen, 1994) and can be used for the purpose.  Alternatively, the soil classification 
can be made based on a soil behavior index, Ic (Robertson and Wride, 1998), which is 
defined as:

The exponent n = 1.0 in the general case of clayey soils (Ic > 2.60), n = 0.5 for clean 
sands (Ic = 1.64), and intermediate values of n apply for mixtures of sand and silt.  
Some iteration may be required for the selection of n and computation of Ic.  The use 
of Ic is preferred over the graphical classification charts as the procedure can be easily 
organized in a computer program.  For CPT in sands with fines ( 60.264.1 << cI ) 
Robertson and Wride (1998) suggested that the (qt1N)cs is inferred as:

allowing more time for pore pressure dissipation, the accumulation of cone 
penetration induced pore pressure is reduced.  This penetration rate reduction created 
a twofold increase of the effective qt (qt minus total pore pressure around the cone tip).  
The less pore pressure generation was apparently due to higher level of consolidation 
when penetration rate was reduced.  The rate of consolidation for soil surrounding a 
cone tip is inversely proportional to the square of the cone diameter (Robertson et al., 
1992).  Therefore, changing the cone diameter can also duplicate the effects of 
penetration rate.  McNeilan and Bugno (1984) reported their experience of CPT in 
offshore California silts.  There was a 2 to 5 minute delay for recycling the 
underwater jacking unit when pushing the cone from seabed.  At the start of the 
subsequent push, temporarily greater qt and sleeve friction, fs were measured.  The 
increase in qt and fs were referred to as setups by McNeilan and Bugno (1984).  The 
setup generally diminished with further penetration.  For the duration of delay 
between recycling the jacking unit in their offshore CPT, silt and sandy silt had the 
most significant setups while CPT in clayey silt had essentially no setup.  McNeilan 
and Bugno (1984) indicated that CPT may be considered drained when the hydraulic 
conductivity of the surrounding soil exceeded 10-3 cm/sec.  For CPT in soils under 
the same density and stress states, the qt value decreased as CPT became partially 
drained and eventually reached a stabilized value when CPT became undrained with 
hydraulic conductivity in the range of 10-6-10-7 cm/sec.  The reason for setups is that 
partial drainage caused a lowered qt due to pore pressure accumulation.  The 2 to 5 
minute delay was long enough for the sandy silt to dissipate pore pressure and 
increase its strength against cone penetration or generate the setup.  The same delay 
time was not sufficient for clayey silt to allow significant pore pressure dissipation 
and thus no measurable setup in the subsequent penetration.  For onshore CPTU, the 
delay can be allowed for as long as it takes to complete a pore pressure dissipation test.  
In this case, the existence of setup following the dissipation test can be used to 
evaluate the silty nature of the surrounding soil had the CPTU is indeed partially 
drained.   
There has been convincing evidence indicating the significant differences in 
stress-strain and strength relationships between reconstituted and undisturbed natural 
sand samples (Ishihara, 1993; Høeg et al., 2000).  With the above background in 
mind, the authors conducted a series of field tests and took undisturbed samples in 
8 
 
muscovite in YLS and slate in KHS, both soils exhibited contractive behavior in 
monotonic triaxial shearing, even when subjected to moderate confining stresses 
(Huang and Huang, 2007; Huang et al., 2008).  The basic physical properties with 
the fines contents to be described in this paper, specific gravity (Gs), liquid and plastic 
limits (L.L. and P.L.) of particles passing #200  sieve of the two types of soils are 
summarized in Table 2.  Details on the physical and mechanical properties of MLS 
are referred to Huang et al. (2004). 
 
CYCLIC TRIAXIAL TESTS ON YLS AND KHS SPECIMENS 
Laval samples (LS) from 3 boreholes along with a series of in situ tests were performed 
at the Yuan Lin test site.  The distributions of sampling and in situ testing locations 
are shown in Figure 4.  The variation of fines contents with depth was established 
first from physical property tests on the standard penetration test (SPT) or split spoon 
samples.  The depths of LS were then targeted to retrieve samples with desired fines 
contents.  Results to be presented in this paper include those of FC = 18% (depths, 
10.98-11.40m), 43% (depths 3.62-4.13m) and 89% (depths 5.90-6.41m), all from 
borehole LS3.  In order to prevent soil structure damage during transportation, the LS 
with FC=18% was frozen above ground after its retrieval.  The soil, while remained in 
the sampling tube, was gradually frozen from top of the sample using dry ice, in 
approximately 24 hours.  Bottom drainage was provided to release pore water due to 
volume expansion during freezing.  The other Laval samples were extruded from the 
sampling tube in the field and sealed in wax before transportation.  Details of the 
sampling technique are referred to Huang and Huang (2007).  
Laval samples have an important advantage due to its large dimensions (200mm 
diameter and 500mm high).  All specimens (70mm diameter and 150mm high) 
involved in a set of cyclic triaxial tests were trimmed from the same Laval sample and 
at exactly the same depth.  The details of trimming and thawing LS specimens are 
described in Huang and Huang (2007).  Because of the high compressibility, the void 
ratio, e after specimen consolidation in the triaxial cell was used in analyzing the test 
data.  The soil specimen was consolidated under an isotropic effective confining stress 
cσ ′  and then subjected to undrained cyclic deviator stress, dσ  in axial direction.  
Three to four cyclic triaxial tests were performed with various cd σσ ′2  values.

during retrieval from the borehole.  The soil sample was extruded from the sampling 
tube just prior to triaxial tests.  Details of gel-push sampling and laboratory specimen 
preparation procedures are referred to Huang et al. (2008).  A total of 13 gel-push 
samples were taken at the Kao Hsiung test site at depths ranging from 5 to 25m.  
Due to the limited diameter of gel-push sampler, the three to four, 70mm diameter 
triaxial test specimens required to define a curve between cyclic resistance ratio, 
cd σσ ′2  and number of cycles, Nc would have to be trimmed from different depth 
levels of the same gel-push sample.  Four of the gel-push samples had sufficient 
lengths ranging from 860-890mm to provide the needed number of specimens and 
thus were chosen for cyclic triaxial tests.  The specimens were isotropically 
consolidated under an effective confining stress, cσ ′  that was close to the expected 
field vσ′ , prior to undrained cyclic loading.  The cyclic triaxial test results are shown 
in Figure 7.  The data points from cyclic triaxial tests on specimens taken from the 
same gel-push sample were more scattered than those of Laval samples shown in 
Figure 5.  The scattering is likely related to the fact that specimens in the same 
cd σσ ′2 - Nc curve were taken from different depth levels.  For a natural soil sample, 
some variations in density and/or gradation as well as degree of disturbance at 
different depth levels of the sampling tube are inevitable.   
 
CPTU TESTS AT THE YUAN LIN AND KAO HSIUNG TEST SITES 
Considering the importance in detecting the drainage conditions during cone 
penetration in a silty sand or sandy silt deposit, attempts were made in the field tests to 
ascertain the drainage conditions associated with CPTU.  A series of CPTU using a 
standard cone (cone cross sectional area=10cm2) penetrating at 20mm/sec (the standard 
CPTU), a large cone (cone cross sectional area=15cm2) penetrating at 20mm/sec (the 
large CPTU), and a standard cone penetrating at 1mm/sec (the slow CPTU) were 
conducted at the Yuan Lin test site.  The pore pressure element was located 
immediately behind the cone face, at the u2 position.  Profiles of fines contents 
according to SPT specimens, CTPU results that include friction ratio, Rf (=fs/qt x100%) 
from tests at Yuan Lin site are shown in Figure 8.  The results indicated no 
significant differences in qt among three types of CPTU, considering drastic 
12 
 
MT method where the sand and fines were fully mixed.  The MLS specimen was 
saturated under a back pressure of 300kPa during CPTU calibration test.  A pore 
pressure dissipation test was conducted in MLS at 0.3-0.4m depth in the calibration 
chamber.  For CPTU in MLS, there were distinct setups as referred to by McNeilan 
and Bugno (1984) or significant increase in qt and fs immediately following the pore 
pressure dissipation test or the start of the subsequent push.  For the field CPTU 
where the fines contents could exceed 50%, the pore pressure dissipation tests were 
basically evidenced by a sharp decrease (due to suspension of the cone penetration) 
and regain of qt and fs values as penetration resumed, without significant setups.   
Figure 12 compares the t50 values among the field and laboratory CPTU and their 
relationships with fines contents.  The t50 was defined as the time required for u2 to 
change from its initial value immediately upon penetration suspension to gain 50% of 
its full range of variation until a plateau in u2 was reached.  For laboratory CPTU in 
MLS, t50 increased significantly as fines content changed from 0 to 50%.  No clear 
trend between t50 and fines contents could be identified from field tests, even where 
the fines contents reached as high as 89%.   
The laboratory results on MLS presented above indicate that at fines contents above 
30%, CPTU behaved as a partially drained test.  The effects of partial drainage were 
demonstrated by the presence of significant setups following a pore pressure 
dissipation test and clear trend between fines contents and t50 as shown in Figure 12.  
The field CPTU at both test sites were close to drained conditions even when the fines 
contents reached as high as 89%.  The drastic differences in the effects of fines 
contents on t50 between CPTU in laboratory prepared, well mixed silty sand and 
natural silt/sand in the field are likely due to the heterogeneity existed in natural soil.  
Figure 13 demonstrates two specimens trimmed from Laval samples.   In Specimen 
A, a clean sand pocket was embedded in a matrix of silt.  The sand and silt particles 
with different colors were randomly layered in Specimen B.  The overall fines 
content of Specimens A and B were 89 and 43%, respectively.  It is believed that the 
presence of closely spaced free draining sand layers made the field CPTU behave as a 
drained test in a silty soil mass, thus resulted in low t50 even when the overall fines 
contents were high.    
 
 
14 
 
correlation curves are practically identical to those suggested by Robertson and Wride 
(1998) respectively for Ic =1.64 (clean sand), 2.1 (FC= 15%) and 2.6 (FC=35%).  
The corresponding FC values included in the parenthesis are determined based on Ic 
and the Ic-FC correlation shown in Figure 1.  The above published correlations for 
silty sand and sandy silt were chosen because they cover or at least overlap with the 
range of fines contents of the soils reported herein. 
The CRR-qt1N data points and those from laboratory tests on reconstituted MLS 
specimens have the following characteristics: 
1. All data points fell to the left of the CRR-qt1N correlation that corresponded to 
silty sand according to Stark and Olson (1995), or to the case of Ic=2.1 according 
to Robertson and Wride (1998).   
2. For the wide range of fines contents involved in the field and laboratory tests on 
YLS and KHS, there was a general trend that the CRR-qt1N data points moved to 
the left as fines content increased.  This trend was consistent with those 
suggested in the available CRR-qt1N correlations shown in Figure 14. 
3. The effects of fines according to tests in natural YLS and KHS were less 
significant than those suggested by tests using the artificial MLS specimens.  At 
much wider range of fines contents, the lateral spread of CRR-qt1N data points 
based on tests in YLS and KHS shown in Figure 14 was less than those from 
tests using the reconstituted MLS specimens or suggested by the available 
CRR-qt1N correlations.   
Based on the findings described in the paper, the following explanations for the 
reasons in adjusting CRR-qt1N correlations due to fines contents and their implications 
in liquefaction potential assessment are postulated: 
The fines content adjustment reflects two aspects in the CRR-qt1N correlations; the 
first aspect deals with the differences in mineral contents and/or grain characteristics 
between sand and fines; and the second aspect deals with the change in drainage 
conditions in CPTU resulted from the increase in fines contents.  Ishihara and 
Harada (2008) demonstrated the differences in CRR-qt1N correlations among clean 
sands due to variations in mineral contents and/or grain shapes.  The data presented 
in this paper have shown that the field CPTU conducted in YLS and KHS can all be 
considered as drained tests, regardless of the fines contents.   Except for those of FC 
= 61 and 89%, the CRR-qt1N data points from YLS and KHS clustered closely with 
16 
 
particles are important aspects that cause the shifting of CRR-qt1N correlations.  The 
characteristics and magnitude of such shifting are apparently soil and site dependent.  
Local calibrations would be highly desirable to establish a fines content adjustment 
scheme to account for the effects of mineral contents and/or grain shapes between 
fines and sand particles.   
The potential effect on drainage conditions in CPTU caused by the increase of fines 
content is another important aspect to be considered in fines content adjustment.  
Significant adjustment in the CRR-qt1N correlation is called for if the fines contents are 
sufficient enough to cause the CPTU to be partially drained and thus qt substantially 
reduced.  In alluvial deposit where the silt/sand soils are often stratified, the CPTU 
can be a drained test even with substantial fines contents due to the presence of 
closely spaced free draining soil layers.  While the stratification may not cause 
significant differences in cyclic strength of the silt/sand soil, its impact on cone tip 
resistance because of the change in drainage conditions is not negligible.  Experience 
gained in field tests indicated that the drainage conditions in CPTU can be determined 
using pore pressure dissipation tests or by changing the rate of penetration.  Had the 
drainage conditions remained the same, the amount of fines content adjustment should 
be associated with and limited to the effects caused by differences in mineral contents 
and/or grain shapes between fines and sand.  The fines content adjustment based on 
available empirical soil classification schemes that relate the CPTU results to fines 
contents may lead to unpredictable errors in liquefaction potential assessment due to a 
lack of consistent correlation between the fines content and these classification 
schemes.  The ignorance of free draining nature of CPTU in stratified alluvial 
silt/sand soils may lead to excessive fines content adjustment and result in over 
estimation of safety factor against soil liquefaction.
