計挑戰的技術之一。三維積體電路技術可以藉由導通孔來連
接不同層之間的訊號，進而有效地減少全域繞線的長度並同
時增加電路效能。然而，由於現階段導通孔大小的限制，其
所佔用晶片的面積在三維積體電路上是一個極重要的課題。
相較於過去文獻上的導通孔總個數最佳化之外，在此計劃，
我們提出一個全新考慮導通孔大小和導通孔位置的三維積體
電路擺置流程架構：(1)考量導通孔密度之三維分析型全域擺
置(3D analytical global placement with density 
optimization and whitespace reservation for TSVs)、
(2)導通孔插入及具導通孔感知之合法化(TSV insertion and 
TSV-aware legalization)、(3)層層的詳細擺置(layer-by-
layer detailed placement)。特別是，我們所提出之全域擺
置是基於一種全新的加權平均線長模型(weighted-average 
wirelength model)。此加權平均線長模型是文獻上第一個不
論在理論上或是實驗上皆可超越已被廣為應用於各類擺置演
算法之 log-sum-exp 線長模型。此外，我們的擺置流程架構
可以藉由預先擺放導通孔的位置而與繞線器做整合，並且可
以先把原本的電路分成不同層輸出，最後再利用傳統的二維
繞線器來繞線。實驗結果顯現出提出的三維全域擺置器非常
有效率。與最近文獻上的三維擺置器比較，所提出的三維擺
置器的可以得到最佳的總繞線長度、導統孔總個數以及總矽

英 文 摘 要 ： Three-dimensional integrated circuit (3D IC) is one 
of the most likely technologies which can overcome 
the high complexity challenge of an intelligent chip 
(iChip) design. Through-silicon vias (TSVs) are 
required for transmitting signals among different 
dies for the 3D IC technology. The significant 
silicon areas occupied by TSVs bring critical 
challenges for 3D IC placement. Unlike most published 
3D placement works that only minimize the number of 
TSVs during placement due to the limitations in their 
techniques, in this project, we propose a new 3D cell 
placement algorithm which can additionally consider 
the sizes of TSVs and the physical positions for TSV 
insertion during placement. The algorithm consists of

2. Literature Survey and Motivation (文獻探討及研究目的) 
The 3D IC placement problem has attracted increasing attention in the recent literature. By reusing 
modern 2D placement results, a folding/stacking based 3D placement method was proposed [CLW+07]. 
This method performs layer re-assignment for cells to further improve 3D placement solutions. A 
partitioning-based approach integrates wirelength, temperature, TSV counts, and thermal effect into the 
min-cut objective [GS07]. As known for the 2D placement problem, however, a partitioning-based approach 
is not as competitive as an analytical one. A multilevel analytical placement method is proposed in [CL09] 
for 3D ICs to relax discrete layer assignment so that the movements of cells are continuous in the z-direction. 
Its basic idea is to use an inter-layer density penalty function to remove cells between layers; however, the 
area occupied by TSVs is not considered during placement. A force-directed 3D placement method was 
proposed recently [KAL09]. A partitioning process is applied to assign cells to different layers, and then a 
force-directed quadratic algorithm is used to place cells and TSVs in a 3D IC. Two design schemes are 
proposed to handle TSVs: (1) TSV-site: it places cells with regular fixed TSVs, and a TSV assignment stage 
then assigns these pre-placed TSVs to cells; (2) TSV co- placement: it simultaneously places TSVs and cells. 
The sizes of TSVs are considered; however, since no physical information is considered during partitioning, 
the placement solution quality is usually limited. 
One of the common deficiencies in the previous works [CL09, CLW+07, GS07] is that the sizes of TSVs 
are not considered. As mentioned earlier, however, TSVs usually occupy significant areas and should be 
considered during 3D IC placement. Traditionally, TSVs are inserted during the routing stage by searching 
whitespace in the whole 3D IC, and thus the quality of a routing result strongly depends on the remaining 
whitespace after the placement stage. Figure 2 illustrates the importance of considering whitespace 
reservation for TSVs during placement. If whitespace is not reserved for TSVs during placement, we 
observe that the available whitespace for TSV insertion is usually located along the chip periphery, 
especially for analytical placement; consequently, the resulting placement would incur longer wirelength 
since a TSV might be inserted in a whitespace far from its connected cells, as shown in Figure 2(a). In 
contrast, with whitespace reservation for TSVs as illustrated in Figure 2(b), a TSV can be inserted among 
cells to reduce the total wirelength. Considering the physical locations of TSVs and their sizes and counts, 
we develop a new analytical cell placement algorithm for 3D IC designs. 
 
Figure 2: Whitespace reservation for TSVs during placement. (a) Without whitespace reservation for TSVs during placement, 
the available whitespace for TSV insertion tends to be located along the chip periphery, especially for analytical placement; 
consequently, the resulting placement would incur longer wirelength since the available TSV might be far from its connected 
cells. (b) With whitespace reservation for TSVs, the resulting total wirelength can be much smaller.

layer-by-layer detailed placement. In 3D global analytical placement, in addition to 3D placement for cells, 
we transform the sizes of TSVs into density constraints such that after the 3D global placement, the 
whitespace required by TSVs is reserved. In the TSV insertion and TSV-aware legalization stage, we first 
legalize cells in the circuit with minimum displacement, and then insert TSVs to their best positions such 
that the overlaps between cells and inserted TSVs are minimized. We fix the positions of TSVs after 
insertion, and legalization for cells is then applied to remove overlaps. In the layer-by-layer detailed 
placement stage, 2D detailed placement techniques are applied to further improve the solution quality, such 
as cell matching for wirelength optimization and cell sliding for density optimization. Since cells have been 
assigned to different layers and TSVs have been inserted, the total wirelength of a net equals the summation 
of the wirelength of its sub-nets in each layer. (Note that the wirelength associated with TSVs is considered 
by the TSV count.) The placement results with inserted TSVs can then be routed layer-by-layer by 
traditional 2D routers. Figure 4 summarizes the flow of the proposed algorithm. In the following, we detail 
the global placement and legalization stages.  
 
3.3. TSV-Aware 3D Global Placement 
In this section, we present the 3D analytical global placement engine and discuss the whitespace 
reservation for TSVs. 
 
3.3.1. 3D Analytical Global Placement Engine 
Since the analytical placement framework has been shown very effective for the 2D placement problem, 
we shall extend this framework to solve the 3D placement problem. After the placement region is divided 
into non-overlapping uniform bin grids on each device layer, the 3D analytical global placement problem 
can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem as follows: 
,layer  and

where W(x, y) is the wirelength function, Z(z) is the number of used TSVs, α is a weighted number, Db,k(x, y, 
z) and Tb,k(x, y, z) are the respective functions that are the total areas of movable blocks and TSVs in bin b 
of layer k, and Mb,k is the maximum allowable area of movable blocks and TSVs in bin b of layer k. Mb,k can 
be computed by Mb,k = tdensity(wb,khb,k – Pb,k), where tdensity is a user-specified target density value for each bin, 
wb,k (hb,k) is the width (height) of bin b of layer k, and Pb,k is the area of pre-placed block in bin b of layer k. 
Unlike traditional 2D placers and previous 3D placers [CL09, CLW+07, GS03, GS07] that only consider the 
density Db,k of movable blocks, the sizes of TSVs are also considered in our formulation. Since the actual 
positions of TSVs are not determined, Tb,k is a dynamic value during the placement process. Tb,k will be 
explained in more detail in Section 4.3.2.

The WA wirelength model converges to the HPWL in Equation (2), as γ converges to 0. It can be shown that 
the WA wirelength model is convex in our practical usage and continuously differentiable by differentiating 
Equation (7) twice with respect to variables eix x . Let )( eWA x  be the estimation error of the WA 
wirelength model with respect to the x coordinate. We have the following estimation error bounds for this

3.3.2. Whitespace Reservation for TSVs 
To estimate the spaces occupied by TSVs, in addition to cell density Db,k, the density of TSVs Tb,k is 
also added to the density constraints for global placement. Since the actual positions of TSVs are not 
determined during global placement, Tb,k is a dynamic value. A reasonable assumption is that the 
communication between neighboring layers of a net is through one TSV. The net-box is defined as the range 
spanned by a net. Just like traditional 2D routing, for a net, placing the corresponding vias inside its net-box 
leads to fewest routing detours. Figure 6 illustrate an example. Given a net and its connected pins, we can 
derive its net-box. We distribute required spaces for TSVs into density cubes inside the net-box evenly, such 
that there are enough spaces for TSV insertion inside this net-box, as shown in Figure 6(c). After 3D 
analytical global placement, the amounts of whitespace needed for TSV insertion are reserved as much as 
possible.

3.4. TSV Insertion and TSV-Aware Legalization 
In this step, we attempt to insert TSVs among legalized cells without overlaps. Since the remaining 
whitespace after 3D global placement may not be enough for inserting TSVs, we use a three-step scheme to 
insert required TSVs and legalize both cells and TSVs such that there are no cell-to-cell, TSV-to-TSV, 
cell-to-TSV overlaps. First, we legalize cells in each layer with minimum displacement without considering 
 10 
 
3.4.2.2. TSV Position Determination 
After each net has been decomposed into 2-pin nets, we start to insert required TSVs into the placement 
region. We sort the 2-pin nets in a non-decreasing order of their net-box sizes, and at each time, the 2-pin net 
with the smallest net-box is chosen for TSV insertion. In this work, we consider the alignment constraint for 
TSVs. As mentioned in Section 4.3.1.2, there are two major types of TSVs. Via-last TSVs which interfere 
with both device and metal layers should be aligned between neighboring device layers, and thus are more 
restricted. In contrast, via-first TSVs interfere with device layer only, and thus can be inserted layer-by-layer 
independently; with the alignment consideration of via-first TSVs, however, interconnections between TSVs 
of neighboring layers can be minimized.

Figure 9: Calculation of overlapping whitespace area. (a) The placement result of the first layer. (b) The placement result of the 
second layer. (c) Overlapping view of the placement result between the first and the second layers. 
 
For each net, we first evaluate the whitespace on each neighboring layer spanned by its net-box. Then, 
we calculate the overlapping whitespace area among these layers enclosed by the net-box. Figure 9 shows an 
example, where two regions of different layers enclosed by the net-box of a 2-pin net are shown. Figures 9(a) 
and (b) show the cells and pre-placed TSVs on these two regions, and Figure 9(c) shows the overlapping 
whitespace area between these two regions. The regions enclosed by the net-box are further divided into 
smaller bins such that at most one TSV can be inserted into a bin. Note that, if the minimum spacing 
constraints for TSVs are considered, the bin size should be slightly larger than the TSV size, such that TSVs 
can be inserted into bins without violating the spacing constraints. After calculating the overlapping 
whitespace area, the TSV positions are decided by searching a bin in the enclosed region such that the 
overlaps between cells and inserted TSVs are minimized, and there is no overlap between any two TSVs, as 
shown in Figure 9(c). If there is not enough whitespace in the net-box, the searched region is doubled, and 
the search process continues. 
 
3.4.3. TSV-Aware Legalization 
After TSVs are inserted, post legalization is applied to remove overlaps between cells and TSVs. The 
legalization techniques presented in Section 5.1 are applied again; at this time, however, TSVs are 
considered as fixed blockages when performing legalization. 
 
 12 
 
Opteron 1.8GHz and 8GB memory, the results also reveal that our algorithm is more efficient. 
The work [CL09] uses an additional interlayer density function and un-connected filler cells for density 
control, which enlarges the placement problem size and complexity, while our algorithm directly optimizes 
the wirelength and TSV counts under density constraints by using the density cube model to spread blocks 
in the whole 3D chip. The experimental results justify the effectiveness and efficiency of our placement 
algorithm. 
 
4.2. TSV-Aware Placement Comparison 
Based on the IWLS [IWLS05] and industry benchmarks used in [KAL09], we also compared with the 
state-of-the-art force-directed 3D placer [KAL09] which considers TSV sizes during placement. As in 
[KAL09], 45nm technology and via-first TSVs were used, TSV cell size was set to 2.47μm×2.47μm, 4-layer 
implementation of 3D IC was assumed, and Cadence SoC Encounter [SOCE] was used to route each layer 
after 3D placement. For each layer, landing pads were inserted as the top mental wire to connect TSVs of 
the layer above, such that interconnections among layers can be complete. For fair comparison, TSV pitches 
are not considered as in [KAL09]; however, we note that TSV pitches can easily be modelled by changing 
the sizes of TSVs, which will not affect our algorithm. 
Table 2 summarizes the experimental results, where routed wirelength, numbers of TSVs, total silicon 
area, runtime for placement are compared. Columns 4 to 7 give the experimental results reported in 
[KAL09], and Columns 8 to 11 list our results. As shown in the table, our algorithm can achieve averagely 
10% shorter wirelength, 21% fewer TSV counts, 18% smaller total silicon area, and significantly shorter 
runtime, compared with the force-directed quadratic placement algorithm [KAL09]. Especially for larger 
circuits, our algorithm can achieve even better results than [KAL09], implying that our algorithm has better 
scalability. (Note that the work [KAL09] conducted its experiments on a Linux machine with eight Intel 
Xeon 2.5GHz CPUs and 16GB memory, similar to our environment except that our machine has 26GB 
memory.) The quality differences might lie in the fact that the work [KAL09] applies partitioning for layer 
assignment before placement. Since there is no physical information during the partitioning, its placement 
quality is usually limited.

circuit des_perf without and with whitespace reservation. The results reveal that TSVs are often inserted at 
whitespace far from the center of the placement region if no whitespace is reserved during global placement 
(see Figure 10(a)), while many more TSVs are inserted close to the center of the placement region with the 
whitespace reservation (see Figure 10(c)). As shown in Figures 10(b) and (d), routing congestion can 
substantially be reduced with whitespace reservation. The results show the effectiveness of our whitespace 
reservation.  
 
4.4. Wirelength Model Comparison 
In Section 4.3.1.2, we showed that the WA wirelength model has smaller estimation error upper bound 
than the LSE one. In this experiment, we examined the empirical results for the two models, based on the 
IWLS and industry benchmarks. To reduce the control factors for fair comparison, the whitespace 
reservation algorithm was not applied. Table 4 lists the placement results of the LSE model. As shown in 
Table 4, our WA model can achieve averagely 1% shorter final routed wirelength and 1% fewer TSV counts 
than the LSE model. It should be noted that, since the LSE model has been shown to achieve the best result 
among recent academic placers and the placement results have been fine tuned, even 1% improvement is 
significant, as they are best known results.

Tutorial Paper) 
 
Abstract: The flip-chip package is introduced for modern IC designs with higher 
integration density, larger I/O counts, faster speed, better signal integrity, etc. To ease 
design changes, an extra metal layer is introduced to redistribute nets between 
wire-bonding (I/O) pads in a die and bump pads in a package carrier. Flip-chip routing 
is performed by redistributing and interconnecting nets between the I/O and bump 
pads. As the design complexity grows, routing has played a pivotal role in flip-chip 
design. In this paper, we first introduce popular flip-chip structures, their 
routing-region modeling, and induced routing problems, survey key published 
techniques for flip-chip routing with respect to specific structures and pad assignment 
methods, and provide some future research directions for the modern flip-chip routing 
problem.

一､參加會議經過 
The ACM/IEEE Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference is sponsored 
by ACM and IEEE and is one of the four most important conferences on VLSI design 
automation in the world. It is a great honor for a researcher or a practicing engineer to 
present her/his work at this conference. This year’s event was held in Yokohama, 
Japan, January 25--27, 2011.  
 
二､與會心得 
This year I was the Technical Program Vice Chair for ASP-DAC-2011. Below is our 
foreword for ASP-DAC 2011: 
On behalf of the Technical Program Committee of the Asia and South Pacific Design Automation 
Conference (ASP-DAC) 2011, we would like to welcome all of you to the conference scheduled from 
January 25 through 28, 2011 at Pacifico Yokohama Conference Center in Yokohama, Japan.  
 
This year, ASPDAC received 335 paper submissions. The submissions span 26 countries/regions in 
Asia, North America, South America, Europe, Oceania, Australia and Africa. The Technical Program 
Committee was composed of 98 professionals who are experts on EDA, IC design, and system design, 
and was organized into 13 subcommittees. All committee members contributed to in-depth, rigorous 
and thorough reviews and most of them attended the paper selection meeting. Through a full day 
face-to-face discussion, 104 quality papers have been selected and compiled into 26 technical sessions 
in a three-day, three parallel tracks program. The acceptance rate is 35%, which is about the same as 
last year. The program is further enriched by three keynote addresses, an additional track of special 
sessions and panels, and excellent tutorial sessions. We sincerely hope you will enjoy and benefit from 
the program.  
 
Each day, technical session starts with a keynote address. We have 9 special sessions on Track D (1D - 
9D). On Wednesday, we have University LSI Design Contest session (1D), and sessions (2D, 3C, and 
3D) for recent advances on emerging memory technologies, post-silicon techniques for variability, and 
verification/debug. On Thursday, we have a session 4D for advanced patterning and DFM beyond 
22nm and two designers’ forum sessions (5D and 6D) on co-design/co-verification for DDR 3 1.6G in 
consumer products and technologies for wellness applications. On Friday, we have an attracting special

commemorative session for Professor Ernest Kuh, a groundbreaking researcher/educator on physical 
design and a Phil Kaufman Award recipient. We are delighted to have a talk by Professor Kuh and 
retrospections on his accomplishments by his former students and associate. Tuesday includes invited 
talks on 3D ICs, placement and DFM routing, given by speakers from Intel, Tezzaron, SpringSoft and 
Mentor Graphics. The physical design contest result is announced in the afternoon of Tuesday. This 
year’s contest is a revisit to placement, a core physical design problem, with particular emphasis on 
routability, which is a growing challenge to sub-65nm technology chip designs. Along with the contest, 
a new set of industrial benchmarks are released and will facilitate scientific evaluations of related 
research results. Finally, Wednesday features invited talks on design for manufacturing by renowned 
academic scholars and industrial expert.  
We would like to thank the authors and the keynote/invited speakers for the contributions to the 
high-quality program. We would like to express our gratitude to the technical program committee 
members and external reviewers, who spent substantial effort on the paper selection. We would also 
like to thank the steering committee, chaired by Prashant Saxena, who put together the wonderful 
invited talks and carefully selected the best paper, as well as the Publication Chair Cheng-Kok Koh, the 
Publicity Chair Bill Halpin, and the Contest Chair Natarajan Viswanathan, for their tremendous 
organizational services. We are also grateful to the sponsors for financial assistance. The symposium is 
sponsored by the ACM SIGDA (Special Interest Group on Design Automation) with technical 
co-sponsorship from the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society. Generous financial contributions have 
also been provided by (in alphabetical order): ATopTech, Cadence, IBM Research, Intel Corporation, 
National Taiwan University, SpringSoft and Synopsys. Last but not the least, we thank Lisa Tolles of 
Sheridan Printing Company for her expertise and enormous patience during the production of the

There were about 20 other papers presented at ISPD-2011. Based on those papers, the 
main research trends in VLSI Design Automation are physical design for 
manufacturability and methodologies for large-scale designs. Due to the advance in 
the nanometer IC technologies, devices and wires are placed in very close proximity, 
and interconnect delay, instead of traditional gate delay, becomes a dominating factor 
in determining circuit performance. It is essential to simultaneously consider area, 
delay, power, noise, and manufacturability for the interconnect optimization in 
systems-on-a-chip design.  
Report on International Collaboration on “Establishing an International 
Research Center on Complexity Management for Future Micro and Nano 
Systems”

I. Purpose 
This project proposed to establish an International Research Center on Micro and 
Nano Systems.  It involves researchers from the U.S., Taiwan, and China.  The 
proposed research activities include investigation and development of efficient SOC 
synthesis tools and methodologies, SOC verification, test, and diagnostic technologies, 
and an SOC design driver that motivates and validates various synthesis, verification, 
and test techniques developed during the course of this research project.  We used an 
SOC design of a multimedia over wireless IP network as the design driver and  
addressed common issues faced by future micro-systems (45nm or below) and nano 
systems, with emphasis on complexity management. The major thrusts of the project 
include 1. Higher level of abstraction (without losing physical reality), 2 reliability 
and reconfigurability, 3 fundamental algorithms for future design automation tools  
of micro and nano systems, 4 technology and design drivers and 5 education.   
 The Center also provided an excellent opportunity to train the next generation of 
young scientists because of the wide range of leading-edge research problems covered, 
as well as the unique international collaborative nature of this project.  The Center 
was simultaneously funded by the National Science Council (NSC) in Taiwan and the 
Chinese National Science Foundation (CNSF) to support the proposed research 
activities of researchers from Taiwan and China, respectively.  Additional funding

IV. Suggestions 
I would like to suggest that NSC simplify the procedures for the report. Too 
much paper work or red-tape not only burdens the staff in NSC, but also affects the 
productivity and efficiency of a researcher. In my opinion, for example, writing a 
report like this one is absolutely unnecessary. A red-tape like this will just hurt 
the competitiveness of our country and benefits to nobody. I wish the 
requirement for writing such a report could be abolished in the near future.

三維積體電路為現今最有可能克服智慧型晶片中高複雜度設計挑戰的技術之一。三維積體
電路技術可以藉由導通孔來連接不同層之間的訊號，進而有效地減少全域繞線的長度並同
時增加電路效能。然而，由於現階段導通孔大小的限制，其所佔用晶片的面積在三維積體
電路上是一個極重要的課題。相較於過去文獻上的導通孔總個數最佳化之外，在此計劃，
我們提出一個全新考慮導通孔大小和導通孔位置的三維積體電路擺置流程架構：(1)考量
導通孔密度之三維分析型全域擺置(3D analytical global placement with density 
optimization and whitespace reservation for TSVs)、(2)導通孔插入及具導通孔感知
之合法化 (TSV insertion and TSV-aware legalization) 、 (3) 層 層 的 詳 細 擺 置
(layer-by-layer detailed placement)。特別是，我們所提出之全域擺置是基於一種全
新的加權平均線長模型(weighted-average wirelength model)。此加權平均線長模型是
文獻上第一個不論在理論上或是實驗上皆可超越已被廣為應用於各類擺置演算法之
log-sum-exp 線長模型。此外，我們的擺置流程架構可以藉由預先擺放導通孔的位置而與
繞線器做整合，並且可以先把原本的電路分成不同層輸出，最後再利用傳統的二維繞線器
來繞線。實驗結果顯現出提出的三維全域擺置器非常有效率。與最近文獻上的三維擺置器
比較，所提出的三維擺置器的可以得到最佳的總繞線長度、導統孔總個數以及總矽晶片面
積。
