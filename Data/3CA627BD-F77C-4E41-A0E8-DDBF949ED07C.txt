propagation neural network.  
We previously proposed an approach for detecting human faces in color images under 
different illumination condition, scale, rotation, with wearing/unwearing glasses, based on 
classification by neural networks. In this paper, we modify the approach by using SVM for 
classification. An overview of our face detection system is depicted in Figure 1. Firstly, skin 
color segmentation is performed to find skin color regions. Secondly, possible face blocks are 
located by using some restrictions on these regions. Thirdly, eye detection and matching are 
carried out within each possible face blocks, and then face candidates will be obtained 
according to the locations of the detected eye pairs. Finally, each of the face candidates is 
verified by an SVM classifier. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discribe how to obtain the 
face candidates. The process of face canidade verification based on SVM is presented in 
Section 3. Section 4 provides some experimental results and comparison with our previous 
method. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.

2. FACE CANDIDATE SEARCHING 
 
The main purpose of this section is to obtain face candidates. There are three steps to achieve 
this goal. First, skin color regions are located by performing skin color segmentation. Second, 
some restrictions to these regions are used to locate possible face blocks. Finally, eye 
detection and matching are implemented within each possible face blocks, and then face 
candidates are determined according to the locations of the detected eye pairs.  
 
2.1 Skin color segmentation 
 
Skin color is a very important feature of human faces. The distribution of skin colors clusters 
in a small region of the chromatic color space [9]. Processing color is faster than processing

2.2 Locating possible face blocks 
 
To check if a skin region contains a face, we use three constraints: Area size, Aspect Ratio, 
and Occupancy. A skin region that satisfies the three constraints is regarded as a possible face 
block; otherwise, a non-face region. 
The first constraint is that the size of the bounding box surrounding the skin region, 
denoted by Area size, is greater than 30×30. This is due to the fact that in a skin region of too 
small size, facial features might be eliminated during the pre-processing. 
The second constraint is that the ratio of the height to the width of the bounding box, 
denoted by Aspect Ratio, is between 0.8 and 2.6. This rule is based on observations on various 
face blocks. 
Occupancy denotes the ratio of the amount of the skin pixels to the size of the bounding 
box. If the bounding box contains a face, the number of skin pixels in the bounding box must 
be large enough. We relax the restriction to avoid removing a real face and set the third 
constraint as “Occupancy is greater or equal to 40%”. 
The skin regions that do not obey all the three constraints are removed, and the remaining 
are considered as possible face blocks and need further verification. 
 
2.3  Determining face candidates 
 
Eye is the most stable facial feature of human face. Suppose face is in frontal view, there must 
be two eyes in the possible face block. Hence, eye detection and matching is carried out to 
detect any eye pair existing in the possible face blocks. During the procedure, a possible face 
block is removed if it contains no eye or only one eye; otherwise, according to the location of 
the detected eye pair, a face candidate is located. 
(i). Eye detection: 
dimensional Hilbert space and to compute a hyperplane that best separates the samples [25].  
The previous section shows how to clip the face candidates according to the detected eye 
pairs. In this section, an SVM based classifier is used to verify each face candidate. The SVM 
used the radial basis function (RBF) kernel as shown in Equation (7). There are 300 face and 
300 non-face gray-level training samples. The size of each training sample is 20×20 pixels. 
They are manually clipped from photographs, digital cameras, or internet. Before training, 
each of the training samples is intensity-normalized by utilizing Equations (8) and (9), where 
N is the number of pixels in a training sample, I  is the average gray value, Ii is the gray value 
of the ith pixel, and Ii’ is the normalized gray value.

Figure 6 shows the intensity-normalization results of some training samples. The original 
images with different intensity and the resulting intensity-normalized images are listed in the 
upper row and the lower row, respectively. As a result, we can observe that the intensity of 
training samples would become uniform after intensity-normalization.

After training by SVM, a face candidate can be verified through the following steps: 
(1). Normalize the size of the face candidate to size of 20×20 by the Nearest Neighbor 
method [16]. 
(2). Apply intensity-normalization to the face candidate by using Equations (8) and (9). 
(3). Input face candidate into the SVM classifier to produce the output. 
 
 
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
 
In this section, we show a set of experimental results to demonstrate the performance of the 
proposed system. Our experiments were implemented in a circumstance using the AMD 
Athlon 2200+ 1.8 GHz CPU, with 512 MB memory and the Windows XP operating system. 
4.1 Performance of SVM classification 
 
There are 300 face and 300 non-face samples tested in our experiment to measure the 
performance of SVM. As shown in Table 1, among the face testing samples, number of false 
rejection is 6 and among the nonface testing samples, number of false acceptance is 12. 
Therefore, the false rejection rate and the false acceptance rate are about 2.00% and 4.00%, 
respectively.
