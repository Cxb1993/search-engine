一、 前言 
在各種燃料電池之中，直接甲醇燃料電池(Direct Methanol Fuel Cell, DMFC)，被認
為是最具潛力可以應用在低功率的 3C 產品之中，因為其可提供高的能量與功率密度，低
污染，接近於室溫的工作溫度，以及迅速有效地補充溶液的種種優點[1]。許多應用於可攜
式電子產品的 DMFC 的原型已亮相。價格過高與量產能力的不足，是 DMFC 目前所遇到的兩
個重要瓶頸，而這兩種因素彼此亦有關聯，所以如何以有效的製程量產能力，降低 DMFC 的
成本，是非常重要的研究主題。 
 
二、 研究目的 
本計畫的主要目的，是要發展圓盤堆疊式的 DMFC 模組，其動機與主持人先前對 PCB 製
程研究類似，希望以目前成熟且廣為使用的光碟製程方式將 DMFC 模組的組件壓合而成，
以減低成本與實現量產的可能性。本研究為一個兩年期計畫，第一年主要為初始概念性的
研究，開發出了單層圓盤燃料電池。今年的研究，則在第一年所建立出來的基礎上，進行
更進一步的研究，設計與製作出兩層堆疊式的 DMFC，並且整合 DC-DC converter、微型空
氣泵與微型液體泵，形成可以小型發電的整合系統，並以實例進行展示。 
 
三、 文獻探討 
一般而言，直接甲醇燃料電池(DMFC)的陰陽雙極板類似於質子交換膜燃料電池(PEMFC)
的雙極板主要的材料可分類為石墨雙極板、金屬雙極板與複合型雙極板[2-5]。目前雙極板
製程可分為（1）Bulk Molding Compression（BMC）[6-7]、（2）射出成形 [8-10] 、（3）
金屬板之電化學加工[11-14]、(4)矽晶圓蝕刻[15-16]與（5）印刷電路板(PCB)板製程
[17-20]。BMC 主要是以熱壓為主，在可攜帶燃料電池之雙極板應用中，因量產速度較慢，
所以不優先考慮[6-7]。射出成形製程可應用導電塑膠複材來製作雙極板，可避開金屬雙極
板需電鍍的缺點[8-10]。矽晶圓蝕刻是一種將燃料電池微小化的微機電製程技術，但是在
系統應用時尚有許多困難需克服[15-16]。PCB 是屬於較新的製程方法，僅有少數的文章針
對氫氧燃料電池，以 PCB 的製程製作做過分析探討[17-20]，可以突破傳統石墨製程的許
多限制，使得燃料電池得以縮小化與多樣化，惟金屬部分需要良好的防腐蝕處理。至目前
為止的文獻，尚未有以本計畫所提出的製程概念製造燃料電池，因此本計畫的內容可視為
頗具創新的研究主題。 
 
四、 研究方法 
(a) 圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池的設計與製作 
1. 陰陽極流道材料的選擇 
由於本研究係延續第一年計畫，將圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池經由主動式輸入發展成被動
式輸入；期能藉此取消泵的驅動以提升圓盤堆疊式 DMFC 之輸出功率。然而若要使用現行傳
統加工方法進行流道的加工勢必難以達成陽極端甲醇燃料自行利用重力與毛細現象傳遞的
目的。因此轉而尋找具有奈米等級，可量產與成熟度高的替代材料方向研究。其中半導體
界常使用的聚二甲基矽氧烷(Polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS)為具有良好的熱穩定性及氧化
穩定性，表面張力低，良好的透氣性及電絕緣性，在加上低溫下仍具有柔軟性、彈性及流
動性等特點，已應用於 MEMS 領域多年。因此本研究將先行藉由實驗量測方法，針對單電池

五、 結果與討論 
1. 單一碟片圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池效能提升探討 
本研究於測試效能中發現，即便依照傳統單電池的壓縮量(MEA 反應區域需突起 0.2mm 以提
升電池的壓縮量)設計，期能達到與單電池相同的效能；然而經過多次測試卻發現即便開路
電壓正常，但效能卻嚴重偏低的現象；因此著手探討圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池壓縮率對於
性能之影響。圖 10 為使用壓克力頂 Pin 的方式之ㄧ；然而經過多次的實驗證實，由於 PDMS
本身過軟的問題導致相對較硬的壓克力片完全崁入 PDMS 流道中。如此ㄧ來不僅未提升電池
效能，反而阻礙了陽極端甲醇的燃料輸送。圖 11 則為使用壓克力陰陽極流道搭配壓克力頂
Pin的另ㄧ種方式。由實驗結果可發現已可大幅降低阻抗由原先的1000mOhm降低到100mOhm
左右。其實驗結果如圖 12 所示，效能已由原先的 0.6V 的 24.49mA cm-2 提升到 57.14 mA 
cm-2，但如此一來便失去了當初用 PDMS 作為陰陽極流道的目的；因此便開始著手修改陰陽
極模具設計。圖 13 為藉由 PDMS 流道於 MEA 區域突起 1.5mm 的方式來改善壓縮率；圖 14 為
其實體拍攝圖。實驗結果如圖 15 所示，在鎖合磅力數為 6kgf-cm 時的電池效能已由原先的
0.6V@24.49 mA cm-2 提升到至 65.31 mA cm-2。由實驗結果發現甚至還約略高於使用壓克力
陽極流道搭配壓克力頂 Pin 的結果。因此由實驗結果可發現效能穩定且有達一定的輸出水
準。 
2. 堆疊式圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池效能提升探討 
本研究先嘗試完成 6Cell 的堆疊式圓盤式直接甲醇燃料。圖 16 為圓盤式直接甲醇燃料
電池堆疊層示意圖，其主要由ㄧ片具有甲醇泵之壓克力外側蓋板、兩組 PDMS 甲醇流道模組
(編號 AN01 與 AN02)、兩組 PDMS 集電模組、6 顆 MEA、兩組 PDMS 空氣流道模組(編號 CA01
與 CA02)、一片壓克力空氣導流版與一片具有空氣泵與變壓器之壓克力外側蓋板組成。其
中具有甲醇泵之壓克力外側蓋板設計如圖 17 所示，主要由燃料輸入孔與引導用的流道所組
成，圖 18 則為具有空氣泵與變壓器之壓克力外側蓋板設計圖，亦由輸入孔組成，值得注意
的是其必須與如圖 19 所示的空氣導流版搭配使用，因為堆疊的關係，空氣無法直接輸入位
於疊層中間的陰極流道。圖 20 則為實體組裝示意圖。圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池實驗平台如
圖 21 所示，主要由(a)數據擷取系統(b)直流電子負載機(d)微歐姆計(e)圓盤式 DMFC(f)蠕
動式泵與(g)3V 直流空氣泵所組成。一般而言，電池堆的連接方式有很多種，其中較常見
的有外部導線連接與低阻抗金屬導通兩種。 
為了簡化線路的複雜性以符合未來微形化的趨勢，研究中著手探討直接甲醇燃料電池堆
在外部導線串聯與使用低阻抗的銅片串連之效能探討。圖 22 為效能曲線圖，由實驗結果可
發現以外部導線串連之效能在 0.3V)與 0.2V 時分別具有 42.1 mA cm-2 與 64.9 mA cm-2；而
在外部銅片串連的狀況下，0.3V 與 0.2V 時分別具有 42 mA cm-2 與 64.8 mA cm-2 的效能，
兩種連接方式的差異僅有 0.001%，因此可使用低阻抗的銅片串連以達到微型化之目地。為
了將圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池堆所產生的電力順利的應用至 3C 周邊，因此本研究依據圖
23 中(a)的電路圖製作如圖中(b)的 5V 輸出微型變壓器模組。將其搭配圓盤式直接甲醇燃
料電池堆基本輸出效能則如表 1所示；實驗以持續運作 10 分鐘，每ㄧ分鐘紀錄一次燃料電
池輸入電壓(Vin)電流(Ain)與經過變壓器後輸出的電壓(Vout)電流(Aout)。由表中可發現
經過變壓器後，圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池輸入 2V 與 320mA 即可將電壓推升至 5V 與 108mA。
然而考慮到現行部分市售 3C 設備僅需 3V 輸入即可運作的狀況下，本研究依據圖 24 中(a)
的電路圖製作如圖中(b)的 3V 輸出微型變壓器模組。將其搭配圓盤式直接甲醇燃料電池堆

 fuel cell is one of the most attractive substitute power 
because it is clean and does not require battery 
ng.  A fuel cell is like a factory that converts chemical 
directly into electrical energy using electrochemical 
s. Therefore, it has much higher efficiency than a 
onal combustion engine. Among the different types of 
s, the direct methanol fuel cell has the most prominent 
l to become a new generation energy source, especially

side. The unused fuel, along with carbon dioxide flows out of 
the cell. Air, electrons and hydrogen protons are combined for 
the reduction reaction and produce water vapor on the cathode 
side [3]. 
The DMFC performance is influenced by several factors; 
the temperature, humidity, fuel concentration, flow channel 
types and the BOP system. Many researchers have investigated 
the DMFC effects under different parameters. The DMFC 
anode flow channel is sustainable. Insufficient anode fuel 
supply creates a serious over potential concentration problem 
that will degrade the DMFC performance. In addition, the 
produced carbon dioxide forms bubbles that block the flow 
channel and prohibit fresh fuel flow. Therefore, it is also 
important to smoothly remove the carbon-dioxide from the 
anode to allow the DMFC to run continuously [4-5].  
The anode flow board effects are briefly reviewed as 
follows. The main advantage of the single serpentine flow field 
(SSFF) is good bubble removal capability. The weaknesses of 
the SSFF are the large methanol concentration gradient and 
high pressure drop between anode entrance and exit. The 
parallel flow field (PFF) improves the large methanol 
concentration gradient and decreases the pressure drop inside  A NOVEL FLOW DESIGN ON THE PLA

FLOWBOARD DESIGN AND CASE STUDIES 
In this section, the mixture model was applied to make 
anode flow board design and simulation. The design strategies 
were also described and shown via five case studies. All 
simulations discussed the anode flow behavior under OCV 
(unloading) conditions. 
 
Case (a): A six-cell PCB-DMFC module 
In the first case, the flow simulation on a six-cell PCB-
DMFC module, shown as Figure 1, was studied. The module 
flow board and the simulation strategy are shown in Figure 2. 
The fuel injected into the module is seen as a higher 
concentration MeOH solution. The original solution staying in  the module can be seen as low concentration MeOH solution. 
Therefore, two phases can be treated as interpenetrating 
continua. In Figure 2, the white area was occupied by the low 
concentration MeOH solution which was originally inside the 
cell. The higher concentration MeOH solution was then 
injected from the inlet entrance, expressed as red color. The 
mixed area was shown in layered colors to express the volume 
fraction of the fresh fuel along with the time. In the simulation, 
the high concentration fuel was injected at a constant flow rate 
of 4cc min-1 and the simulation accuracy was verified by a red 
ink experiments. In the red-ink experiment, the fresh MeOH 
solution (10% vol.) was pre-mixed with a small amount of red-
ink and the pure water was adopted to emulate the original low 
concentration MeOH solution (0% vol.) which was transparent 
in the color. Figure 3 is the geometry and main dimensions of 
Case (b). Figure 4 shows a comparison of the CFD simulation 
and the red-ink experiment for the six-cell case at different 
injection times. The legend of the contour plot represents the 
volume fraction of the high concentration fuel. In order to 
make more clear comparison with the red-ink experiment, the 
range of the volume fraction legend was set between 0.5 and 1. 
The area with the fresh fuel volume fraction less than 0.5 
would show color in blank. The results show that the flow front 
shape of the fresh fuel was very close to the red-ink 
experiments. The results also illustrated this flow board design 
would cause the fuel supply in non-uniformity. It implied that 
the DMFC performance will drop sharply after running a 
period because a severe concentration over potential will 
begins to occur in the left cell due to insufficient fresh fuel 
supply. 
 
Case (b): A three PCB-DMFC module flow design I 
The case (a) result shows that it is quite difficult to 
produce uniform fresh fuel transportation to every cell 
simultaneously in a long array design. Therefore, in the second 
case, the module was reduced from six to three cells, as shown 
in Figure 5. The three-cell module flowboard design I and its 
main dimensions were shown in Figure 6. The higher 
concentration MeOH solution was injected from the right side 
into the left. The comparison of simulation and experimental 
results is shown in Figure 7. In the red-ink experiment, the 
fresh MeOH solution (10% vol.) was pre-mixed with a small 
amount of red-ink and the pure water was adopted to emulate 
the original low concentration MeOH solution (0% vol.) which 
was transparent in the color. The legend of the contour plot 
represented the volume fraction of the high concentration fuel. 
In order to make more clear comparison with the red-ink 
experiment, the range of the volume fraction legend was set 
between 0.5 and 1. The area with the fresh fuel volume fraction 
less than 0.5 will show the color in blank. The results show that 
the flow front shape of the higher concentration fuel by CFD 
simulation was very close to the red-ink experiments at 
different times. The results also show that this flow board 
might not be able to make a uniform fuel solution supply. If the 
three-cell DMFC adopts this design, the DMFC performance 3 Copyright © 2008 by ASME

ABSTRACT 
A direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) with a BOP system is 
introduced. The DMFC stack operating with this BOP system is 
characterized. The DMFC stack performance gradually 
degrades as flooding occurs. A series of experiments under 
different environmental conditions were carried out to 
determine the ways for minimizing flooding. The results show 
that the water flooding more easily occurs when the DMFC 
stack operating in a closed system than in an open system. In a 
closed system, the temperature is the most important control 
factor to maintain the DMFC stack sustainable operation. Lower 
temperature differences among the airflow entrance, the exterior 
side DMFC module, and the DMFC sidewall temperature could 
reduce the possibility of water flooding occurs inside the DMFC 
stack. In addition, a large temperature difference between 
airflow entrance and exit of the DMFC stack would also lead June 16-18, 2008, Denver, Colorado, USA

cost, operating at near room temperature and a short start-up 
time [2-3]. Many portable DMFC prototypes have appeared in 
recent years.  
Maintaining the DMFC in good performance during 
operation is essential during the application design. 
Understanding the parameter effects on DMFC performance 
helps developers to make suitable environmental controls in the 
system design. Narayanan et al. discussed the pressure, 
temperature and airflow effects. Their results showed that cell 
performance is higher when the temperature is increasing, but 
more methanol crossover occurs. The airflow rate is low at 
higher temperatures but is obvious at pressures close to ambient 
[4]. Ge and Liu made systematic experiments to investigate the 
operating parameter effects on DMFC performance. Several 
phenomena were observed in their study. The cell performance 
Because the air/vapor flowing in the condenser comes from the 
stack cathode outlet, the temperature of the sidewall near the 
condenser is higher than that at the exterior side. 
Figure 12 is the cell voltages of the twenty-four cells in the 
stack when operating in an open system without an exterior 
sidewall heater under the 0.7A CC mode. The DMFC stack 
outside channel (TSW3) was 54.1oC and the DMFC side wall 
(Tsw4) was 47.6oC, the difference was 6.5oC. The DMFC stack 
air inlet temperature (Tin) was 23.1oC and air exit temperature 
(Tout) was 53.1oC, the difference was 30oC. Even though these 
temperature differences might lead water vapors condensed 
inside the DMFC stack, but the inlet air was not saturated vapor 
because the system was open and the water vapor ratio of the 
airflow obtained from the uncondensed water vapor of the 
condenser could not be accumulated such that the water 
flooding did not occur at this condition. Therefore, the DMFC 
stack was sunning smoothly and each individual cell voltage 
was found stable after running for over one hour, although the 
voltages were different among the cells. 
 
(b) The DMFC stack with BOP at an open System with a 
sidewall heater: 
In this case, the DMFC stack was tested without the plastic 
case with a heater added to the exterior sidewall. The exterior 
sidewall could be heated such that the temperature difference 
between the exterior sidewall and the wall near the condenser 
could be minimized. In this case, the exterior sidewall was 
heated and kept at 60oC. 
Figure 13 is the cell voltages of the twenty-four cells in the 
stack when operating in an open system with a sidewall heater 
under the 0.7A CC mode. The DMFC stack outside channel 
(TSW3) was 64.4oC and the DMFC side wall (Tsw4) was 58.1oC, 
the difference was 6.3oC. The DMFC stack air inlet temperature 
(Tin) was 32.3oC and air exit temperature (Tout) was 55.2oC, the 
difference was 22.9oC. Those temperature differences in case 
(b) were smaller than in case (a). Same as case (a), even though 
these temperature differences might lead water vapors 
condensed inside the DMFC stack, but the inlet air was not 
saturated vapor because the system was open and the water 
vapor ratio of the airflow obtained from the uncondensed water 
vapors of the condenser could not be accumulated such that the 
water flooding did not occur at this condition. The DMFC stack 
was also running smoothly and each individual cell voltage was 
found stable after running for over one hour, although the 
voltages were different among the cells. 
 
(c) The DMFC stack with BOP at a closed system without 
heater: 
In this case, the DMFC stack was tested covered by a 
plastic case, i.e., in a closed system. The exterior side was free 
convected with nearby air. Because the air/vapor flowing into 
the condenser came from the stack cathode outlet, the 
temperature of the sidewall near the condenser was higher than 
that at the exterior side.   Figure 14 is the cell voltages of the twenty-four cells in 
the stack when operating in a closed system without an exterior 
sidewall heater under 0.7A CC mode. The DMFC stack outside 
channel (TSW3) was 60.1oC and the DMFC side wall (Tsw4) was 
54.4oC, the difference was 5.7oC. The DMFC stack air inlet 
temperature (Tin) was 38.5oC and air exit temperature (Tout) was 
60.2oC, the difference was 21.7oC. 
Even though the temperature differences were smaller than 
those in case (a) and (b), but the voltage of cell 24 was found to 
continuously degrade when the DMFC was running. This 
degradation was caused by cathode water flooding occurring at 
cell 24. In the closed system, the ratio of water/vapor of the 
airflow would increase to saturated vapors or even condensed in 
the system environment because the uncondensed water vapors 
of the condenser continuously dissipating to the closed DMFC 
system environment. Therefore, the airflow humidity would 
reach 100%RH when the DMFC stack keeps running. So, two 
major possibilities contributed the water flooding in this case. 
The first one was the temperature between DMFC exterior side 
module temperature (TSW3) and the sidewall temperature (TSW4) 
which led the water condensed at the DMFC exterior side 
module. The second one was the large temperature difference 
between the airflow in temperature and exit temperature of the 
DMFC stack. As described above, the uncondensed water of the 
condenser would continuously dissipate to the closed system 
environment. Small amount of the surrounding fresh air with 
lower temperature will replenish to the closed system from the 
side vents of the DMFC plastic case. The existing air/vapor will 
be mixed with the fresh air and the temperature will also reduce 
by the fresh air. The temperature drop would lead the water 
vapor condensed. Therefore, the DMFC stack might also 
inbreathe some condensed water particles such that the blower 
was able to drive the accumulated water particles and the water 
flooding occurred inside the DMFC stack. Those two reasons 
impacted the side module first, the condensed water particles 
tended to be choked at the cell closest to the air flow exit, i.e., 
Cell 24. 
 
(d) The DMFC stack with BOP at a closed system with a 
sidewall heater: 
In this case, the DMFC stack was tested covered by a 
plastic case, i.e., a closed system. A heater was added to the 
exterior sidewall. The exterior sidewall could be heated such 
that the temperature difference between the exterior sidewall 
and the wall near the condenser could be minimized. 
Figure 15 shows the cell voltages of the twenty-four cells in 
the stack when operating in an open system with a sidewall 
heater under the 0.7A CC mode. The exterior sidewall was 
heated and maintained at 60oC. The DMFC stack outside 
channel (TSW3) was 64.3oC and the DMFC side wall (Tsw4) was 
61.0oC, the difference was 3.3oC. The DMFC stack air inlet 
temperature (Tin) was 52.3oC and air exit temperature (Tout) was 
63.5oC, the difference was 11.2oC. 
Under this situation, the voltage of several cells reduced at 
the beginning of the DMFC stack run. After running for 10-15 3 Copyright © 2008 by ASME
