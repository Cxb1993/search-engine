(二) 英文摘要
This proposal for a two-year project aims at the development of a new LC-tuned
quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO) to provide differential IQ signals for
the Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) direct conversion transceivers applications. In this
project, firstly we would like to evaluate some possible configurations based on our
proposed topology according to tsmc’s 0.18 um RF-CMOS process. After evaluation,
we select the cascade-coupled CMOS QVCO as our final circuit configuration. The
VCO for multi-band or wide tuning range applications will be demonstrated by using
our proposed switchable inductor. Based on a new frequency plan, we have proposed
a new RF synthesizer architecture for UWB MB-OFDM system. A quadrature VCO
that can operate at 6,072 / 6,600 MHz by using the switchable inductor is designed
for such synthesizer. The simulation results of QVCO shows that the oscillation
frequency can operate at 6,072 MHz or 6,600 MHz. At 1.8 V power supply voltage
the QVCO core draws 8.733 mA and a total power consumption of QVCO core
circuit is 15.72 mW. The simulated phase noise at 1 MHz offset from the center
frequency (6.136 GHz) is -115 dBc/Hz when switch MOS turns OFF. The simulated
phase noise at 1 MHz offset from the center frequency (6.622 GHz) is -114 dBc/Hz
when switch MOS turns ON. The tuning frequency range is from 5,858 MHz to
6,437 MHz and 6,436 MHz to 7,018 MHz through MOS varactor and switchable
capacitor array when switch MOS turns OFF and ON respectively. Finally, the
QVCO with integrating our proposed switchable inductor is also fabricated by TSMC
0.18 μ m 1P6M standard CMOS technology. We will briefly report the
measurement results. The design considerations of this present QVCO circuit focus
on low phase noise, low power consumption, low phase/amplitude errors, and wider
tuning range. The measurement data shows the oscillation frequency ranging from
6,399 MHz to 7,335 MHz. The phase noise at 1 MHz offset frequency is about -113
dBc/Hz at the oscillation frequency.

φ=0 of the parallel resonator as shown in Figure 9(a). Moreover the coupling transistor
consumes additional power and contributes as another noise source and parasitic capacitor
which decrease overall tuning range. To resolve the phase noise degradation the S-QVCO
topology will be used [6] as shown is Figure 10. The cascode coupling method does not
require additional power consumption and the resonator does not provide extra phase shift
thus the QVCO can oscillate at maximum Q of the resonator as shown in Figure 9(b) and
discussed as following. In Figure 4.36(b) the coupling transistor Mcp, can be view as a
differentiator which provides additional phase shift. The total current gm(VA-VC) does not
need resonator phase shift, where VC can be expressed as

has less parasitic capacitance compared with P-QVCO due to removal of the connection of
the drain parasitic capacitance of coupling transistor at the resonance using cascode
connection.

Figure 11 Our proposed quadrature VCO architecture.
(1) Frequency planning：Before to design the UWB MB-OFDM synthesizer a suitable
frequency plan is necessary for simplifying architecture and obtaining good
performance of the synthesizer. After doing the frequency plan as shown in Table 1
the QVCO that operated at 6,072 MHz or 6,600 MHz is one of the important block for
generating reference tone of our proposed synthesizer architecture.
(2) QVCO circuit configuration：There are many ways to generate the quadrature signal
such as frequency division, ring oscillator, VCO combine with RC polyphase filter,
etc. However, a more attractive approach to generate quadrature signal is to use two
symmetric LC-tank VCOs to couple each other. As mention previously, the S-QVCO
architecture which means the coupling transistor to place in series with switch
transistors has excellent phase noise performance than the P-QVCO architecture
which means the coupling transistor to place in parallel with switch transistors base
on comparing the SpectreRF simulation results between them [7] [6]. Moreover the
S-QVCO also exhibiting the advantage of less parasitic capacitance and low power

<7> Measurement Results：
This QVCO circuit is fabricated by tsmc’s 0.18um RF CMOS technology. The
measured tuning range is shown in Figure 34. The tuning range rises from 6,399 MHz
to 7,335 MHz with the tuning range from 0 V to 2.0 V. Because of the series resistance
is not included in our post-layout simulation, the operation bias voltage is set to 2.0 V
in our experiment. The measured phase noises are shown in Figure 35 (a) and (b), as
the switched inductor is turned off and on, respectively. Typically, the measured phase
noise at 1 MHz offset is around -112.7 dBc/Hz at the center frequencies of 6,708 MHz
(as the inductor switch is OFF) and 6,968 MHz (as the inductor switch is ON).
The measure frequency is out of design specification. However, we will continue
to tuning in the second research year.
