pervaporation performance, it is interesting to understand the correlation between the 
polyamide fine structure and the different interfacial polymerization conditions (IP-I 
and IP-II) by means of a positron annihilation study. Moreover,  another novel 
thin-film composite membranes were prepared via interfacial polymerization by 
reacting 5-nitrobenzene-1,3-dioyl dichloride (NTAC) or 5-tert-butylbenzene-1,3-dioyl 
dichloride (TBAC) with triethylenetetraamine (TETA) on the surface of a modified 
polyacrylonitrile (mPAN) membrane (TETA-NTAC/mPAN and TETA-TBAC/mPAN). 
These TFC polyamide membranes were then applied in the pervaporation separation 
of aqueous isopropanol solution at 25 oC. The polyamide layer’s characteristics such 
as morphology, surface roughness, hydrophilicity, degree of crosslinking, free volume 
and thickness were correlated with the pervaporation performance.  
The free volume has a significant effect on the separation performance of the 
membrane in the pervaporation operation. However, the measurement of the free 
volume is difficult because the free volume is a dynamic pore. Positron annihilation 
spectroscopy (PAS) with a variable monoenergetic slow positron beam is a powerful 
technique to measure the free volume of a material. The chemical and structural 
effects of the polymer on the free volume have been reported, but there has not been 
much work on the depth profile for the free volume variation in the thin-film 
composite membranes . The variations in the free volume of these novel polyamide 
thin-film composite membranes were measured by positron annihilation spectroscopy 
(PAS) with a variable monoenergetic slow positron beam. 
 
 Experimental 
 Materials 
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymer was supplied by the Tong-Hua Synthesis Fiber 
Co. Ltd. in Taiwan. Reagent grade N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was used in 
preparing the casting solution of the PAN polymer. Triethylenetetraamine (TETA) was 
purchased from Merck Co. Trimesoyl chloride (TMC) was purchased from TCI Co. 
5-Nitrobenzene-1,3-dioyl dichloride (NTAC) and 5-tert-butylbenzene-1,3-dioyl 
dichloride (TBAC) were synthesized in our laboratory. Amine (TETA) and acyl 
chloride monomers (NTAC and TBAC) were used for the interfacial polymerization 
to form the polyamide active layer. Distilled water was used in preparing the aqueous 
amine solution, and reagent grade tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used as the acyl 
chloride monomer solvent. The chemical structures of the monomers used to prepare 
the polyamide active layers via interfacial polymerization are shown in Figure 1.

NMP solvent. In order to enhance the hydrophilicity of membrane support to benefit 
the sorption of the amine monomer in it, the PAN porous membrane support was 
hydrolyzed by NaOH solution. The modified PAN porous membrane was prepared by 
immersing the PAN porous membrane support in a 2M NaOH solution at 50°C. The 
partial -CN groups of PAN can be converted into -COOH and -CONH2 groups after 
undergoing hydrolysis in a NaOH solution. The mPAN porous membrane was washed 
in a water bath for several hours to remove the remnants of the NaOH solution. 
 
 Preparation of the polyamide thin-film composite membrane 
The polyamide thin-film composite membrane was prepared by the interfacial 
polymerization of the amine monomer TETA and the acyl chloride monomer (TMC, 
NTAC or TBAC). The mPAN membrane was first immersed in a 1 wt% aqueous 
amine solution for 30 sec. Then, the excess aqueous amine solution on the surface of 
the mPAN membrane was removed. The mPAN membrane, soaked with the aqueous 
amine solution, was brought into contact with a 1 wt% organic acyl chloride solution 
for 30 sec to carry out the interfacial polymerization. Finally, the resulting polyamide 
thin-film composite membrane was washed in methanol and then dried at atmospheric 
temperature. The schematic diagram for the chemical reaction showing the structure 
of the synthesized polyamide as a result of the interfacial polymerization between 
TETA and diacyl chloride (NTAC or TBAC) on the surface of the mPAN membrane 
was shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 The schematic diagram for the chemical reaction showing the structure of the 
synthesized polyamide as a result of the interfacial polymerization between 
TETA and diacyl chloride (NTAC or TBAC) on the surface of the mPAN 
membrane. 
 
In addition, Interfacial polymerization conditions I (IP-I) is illustrated in 
Scheme 3 (a). In IP-I, the time of contact between the surface of the dry mPAN 
membrane and the 2 wt% TETA aqueous solution at 50oC is 300 sec. The excess 
amount of the TETA aqueous solution that remains on the surface of the mPAN 
membrane is removed. To carry out interfacial polymerization, the mPAN membrane 
soaked with TETA aqueous solution is immersed in a toluene solution containing 1 
wt% TMC at atmospheric temperature for 180 sec. After removal from the toluene 
solution, the resulting polyamide TFC membrane undergoes heat treatment in an oven 
at 70oC for 60 min to attain the desired membrane structure. Finally, the resulting 
membrane is washed in methanol. 
Interfacial polymerization conditions II (IP-II) is illustrated in Figure 1 (b). In

where E0 is the initial the light transmission value (light transmission value before 
pouring organic diacryl chloride solution into the beaker), and Ei is the light 
transmission value after pouring organic diacryl chloride solution into the beaker at 
each time interval. 
When the organic diacryl chloride solution contacted with the aqueous TETA 
solution, a free-standing polyamide membrane was formed at the interface between 
them through the interfacial polymerization. With an increase in the time, the growth 
of the free-standing polyamide membrane affected the variation in the light 
transmittance which was used to observe the reactivity between the aqueous amine 
solution and the organic acyl chloride solutions.  
 
 Positron annihilation spectroscopy 
PAS was used to estimate the free volume variations in the depth profile of the 
polyamide thin-film composite membrane. A variable monoenergetic slow positron 
beam as a function of the positron incident energy (0-30 keV) at atmospheric 
temperature under a vacuum of ~10-8 torr. The radioisotope beam used 50 mCi of 22Na 
as the positron source. Two positron annihilation spectrometers were installed in this 
beam¾Doppler broadening energy spectroscopy (DBES) and positron annihilation 
lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). The DBES was measured using an HP Ge detector at a 
counting rate of approximately 2000 cps. The total number of counts for each DBES 
was 1.0 million. The DBES is based on the measured width of the annihilation gamma 
photon line, centered at 511 keV. The Doppler-broadened linewidth can be described 
with simple lineshape parameters, such as the shape (S) parameter. The S parameter, 
defined as the ratio of the central part of the annihilation spectrum to the total 
spectrum, reflects the positron annihilation with low momentum valence electrons. 
The S parameter data from DBES was fitted by VEPFIT program. The PALS 
experiment provides more quantitative information on the free volume properties in 
polymeric systems. The PALS data were obtained by taking the coincident events 
between the start signal detected by a multichannel plate (MCP) from the secondary 
electrons and the stop signal discerned by a BaF2 detector from the annihilation 
photons at a counting rate of approximately 200-300 cps. A PALS spectrum contains 
2.0 million counts. From the analysis of positron annihilation lifetime spectrum, 
positron lifetimes (τ1, τ2 and τ3) and relative intensities (I1, I2 and I3), which result 
from the positron and positronium annihilation in polymeric membranes, can be 
determined. The lifetime τ3 from pick-off annihilation of ortho-positronium (o-Ps) and 
electron, which is on the order of 1-5 ns in polymeric membranes, is related to the size 
of the free volume. τ3 is usually used to calculate the mean free-volume radius. I3 may 
directly indicate the concentration of the free volume because of the amount of the 
formed Ps annihilating with the electrons in microcavities may correspond to the free 
volume. That is, an increase in I3 is approximately equivalent to an increase in the 
concentration of the free volume. Therefore, τ3 and I3 from PALS can be used to 
explore the depth profiles of the size and concentration distributions of the free 
volume in polymeric thin-film composite membranes. All of the positron annihilation 
lifetime spectra were analyzed by a finite term lifetime analysis method using the 
PATFIT program.

polyamide thin-film composite membranes. Compared with the spectrum of mPAN 
(Figure 2(a)), an increase in the intensity of the peaks at wave number 1580 cm-1, 
corresponding to the N-H (amide II) of the amide group, is shown in the spectra for 
the polyamide thin-film composite membranes (TETA-NTAC/mPAN and 
TETA-TBAC/mPAN) (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)). A shift of the amide I peak from 1631 
cm-1 (C=O of the acrylamide group in mPAN) to 1664 cm-1 (C=O of the amide group 
in the polyamide) is shown in the spectra (Figure 2). In addition, the peak at 1613 
cm-1, corresponding to the vibrational modes and the C=C stretching of the aromatic 
ring, is shown in Figures 2(b) and 2(c). The results reveal that the active layers of the 
thin-film composite membranes were composed of aromatic polyamides.

Figure 2 ATR-FTIR spectra for (a) the pristine PAN membrane support and the 
polyamide thin-film composite membranes: (b) TETA-NTAC/mPAN and (c) 
TETA-TBAC/mPAN. 
 
The surface chemical compositions of the polyamide thin-film composite 
membranes were investigated by XPS analysis. Figure 3 shows the C1s X-ray 
photoelectron spectra of the polyamide thin-film composite membranes, and their 
relative bond assignments from these spectra are shown in Table 1. There are two 
peaks that correspond to the -N-C=O and -COOH groups at 287.6 eV and 288.9 eV, 
respectively, in the C1s spectra of the TETA-NTAC/mPAN and TETA-TBAC/mPAN 
membranes. The -N-C=O group was formed by the reaction of an amine group with 
an acyl chloride group during the interfacial polymerization process, and the -COOH 
group was generated by the hydrolysis of the unreacted acyl chloride group. A greater 
number of -COOH groups on the polymer chain of the interfacially polymerized 
polyamide indicates that many acyl chloride groups did not react with amine groups, 
resulting in a shorter polymer chain and a lower polymer chain entanglement. As 
shown in Table 1, the concentration of the -N-C=O and -COOH groups were 8.39% 
and 1.92% for the TETA-NTAC/mPAN membrane and were 2.98% and 3.85% for the 
TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane, respectively. The relative ratio of the -COOH to 
-N-C=O groups was higher for the TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane than the 
TETA-NTAC/mPAN membrane. This implies that the TETA-NTAC/mPAN 
membrane had a greater degree of polymer chain entanglement and/or crosslinking 
than the TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane. Thus, a higher selectivity in the 
pervaporation separation process was obtained, resulting from the membrane with a 
 18
Thus, we focused on the variation in the S parameter for this region of the polyamide 
active layer. As shown in Figure 4, the S parameter was higher for the TETA-NTAC 
polyamide layer than the TETA-TBAC polyamide layer. This indicates that the free 
volume size of the TETA-NTAC polyamide layer was larger than that of the 
TETA-TBAC polyamide layer.

In addition, to illustrate the variation in the S parameter along the depth of the 
composite membrane, the S parameter data as a function of the positron incident 
energy were fitted by the VEPFIT program analysis in a four-layer model and the 
results showed in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6, the polyamide thin-film composite 
membrane was divided into four layers. These four layers indicated are as follows: (I) 
interfacially polymerized polyamide (PA) layer, (II) transition layer from polyamide 
layer to dense skin layer of mPAN support, (III) dense skin + porous support layer of 
mPAN, and (IV) porous support layer of mPAN. The effective selective layer of the 
thin-film composite membrane is the polyamide active layer. The thickness of the 
polyamide active layer also estimated from the VEPFIT program analysis. The 
thickness of the TETA-NTAC and TETA-TBAC polyamide layers were about 196 and 
153 nm, respectively. From the result of DBES analysis, the TETA-NTAC/mPAN 
membrane had a higher S parameter and a thicker thickness for the polyamide active 
layer than the TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane. In the pervaporation separation 
process, an increase in the free volume and an increase in the thickness for a 
polymeric membrane are favorable to an increase in the permeation rate and an 
increase in the selectivity, respectively.

 Surface hydrophilicity and roughness 
The surface hydrophilicity of the polyamide thin-film composite membrane was 
estimated by the surface water contact angle and water vapor sorption measurements. 
The results are shown in Table 3. Compared with the TETA-NTAC/mPAN membrane, 
the TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane had a lower water contact angle and a higher 
water vapor sorption ratio. This indicates that the TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane had 
a higher hydrophilicity, resulting in a higher water vapor sorption ratio. In addition to 
the innate characteristic of the polymeric membrane, the surface roughness affects the 
water contact angle. For a hydrophilic polymer membrane, a rougher membrane 
surface produces a lower water contact angle, indicating higher affinity between water 
molecular and polymer membrane. The surface roughness of the polyamide thin-film 
composite membranes was measured by AFM, and the results are shown in Table 4. 
The root mean square roughness (Rms), the average roughness (Ra) and the maximum 
roughness (Rmax) were all higher for the TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane than for the 
TETA-NTAC/mPAN membrane. This suggests an increase in the hydrophilicity of the 
TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane.

The polyamide thin-film composite membranes were successfully prepared via 
interfacial polymerization of TETA with NTAC or TBAC and were applied to the 
dehydration of an aqueous ethanol solution. The following conclusions were obtained:  
As a result of the PAS experiments, the TETA-NTAC polyamide layer of the 
composite membrane had a higher S parameter, a higher τ3 (free volume size), a 
higher I3 (free volume concetration), as well as a thicker polyamide layer thickness, 
compared with the TETA-TBAC polyamide layer. 
From the analyses of the XPS, AFM and water contact angle measurements, the 
TETA-NTAC/mPAN membrane had higher degree of crosslinking, lower surface 
roughness of the active layer and lower hydrophilicity than the TETA-TBAC/mPAN 
membrane. 
The TETA-NTAC/mPAN membrane showed both a higher permeation rate and 
water concentration in permeate than the TETA-TBAC/mPAN membrane. The 
solution effect primarily controlled the pervaporation separation behavior of the 
polyamide thin-film composite membrane in the dehydration of a 90 wt% aqueous 
ethanol solution at 25℃.

Part 2 Positron annihilation study on thin-film composite pervaporation 
membranes: Correlation between polyamide fine structure and different 
interfacial polymerization conditions 
 
Results and discussion 
 
Chemical structure 
FTIR-ATR spectra for pristine PAN membrane support, modified PAN (mPAN) 
membrane support (result of PAN treatment in 2M NaOH solution at 50 oC) and 
polyamide TFC membranes prepared via IP-II and IP-I are shown in Figure 1 below. 
Compared with the spectrum for the PAN membrane (Figure 1 (a)), the mPAN 
membrane has four peaks at wave numbers 3300-3400, 1738, 1664 and 1564 cm-1, as 
shown in Figure 1 (b). The first two peaks correspond to -OH and C=O of carboxyl 
acid group, respectively. The last two peaks correspond to C=O (amide I) and -NH 
(amide II) of acryl amide group, respectively. Such spectra revealed that partial –CN 
groups of PAN membrane were converted to –COOH or –CONH2 groups, as a result 
of PAN hydrolysis in NaOH solution.  
Compared with the spectrum for the mPAN membrane, the peaks of C=O 
(amide I) and -NH (amide II) of amide group shift from 1664 cm-1 to 1668 cm-1 and 
from 1564 cm-1 to 1558 cm-1, respectively, as shown in the spectra for the polyamide 
TFC membrane prepared via IP-II (Figure 1 (c)). The spectrum for the polyamide 
TFC membrane prepared via IP-I (Figure 1 (d)) also exhibits two peaks at wave 
numbers 1638 and 1547 cm-1, corresponding to C=O (amide I) and N-H (amide II) of 
amide group, respectively. The spectra in Figure 1 confirmed that the TFC 
membrane’s active layer is composed of polyamide.

From the results of SEM and AFM analyses, the two different interfacial 
polymerization conditions utilizing the same monomers cause the variation in the 
roughness of the polyamide active layers. To complement the SEM and AFM data, the 
water contact angle for the polyamide TFC membrane was measured and the values 
are included in Table 2. The water contact angle data reveal that the polyamide TFC 
membrane prepared via IP-I show a lower water contact angle than that prepared via 
IP-II. This result corresponds very well to the results from SEM and AFM analyses. 
These aforementioned results are in line with a defect-free and a thinner layer of the 
polyamide TFC membrane prepared via IP-II, and such characteristics are beneficial to 
obtain a higher permeation rate and separation factor. In this regard, it is interesting to 
understand to a greater extent the effect of the variation in the fine-structure in the 
depth profile of the polyamide TFC membrane on the pervaporation performance in 
the following experiments.  
 
Positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) of polyamide TFC membranes prepared via 
different polymerization conditions  
To investigate the free-volume variation and the depth profile of the polyamide 
TFC membranes, PAS experiments were carried out by means of a slow positron beam. 
The S parameter as a function of the positron incident energy from DBES for the 
polyamide TFC membranes prepared via IP-I and IP-II is shown in Figure 4. 
Compared with the S parameter for the membrane prepared via IP-II, the observation 
drawn from the S parameter for the polyamide TFC membrane prepared via IP-I 
reveals a very small plateau existing near the membrane surface, as shown in Figure 4 
(b).  
From the results of the S curves in Figure 4, the rapid increase in the S value near 
the membrane surface at the positron incident energy value of lower than about 0.5

Figure 5 plots the o-Ps lifetime (τ3) as a function of the positron incident energy 
for the polyamide TFC membrane prepared via IP-I and IP-II. Figure 5 (a) shows a 
rapid drop of τ3 near the membrane surface at the positron incident energy lower than 
0.5 keV. This is a typical phenomenon of positronium annihilation due to the 
back-diffusion and -scattering of the o-Ps from the surface to the vacuum. A zone with 
lower τ3 values at positron incident energies from 0.5 to 1.5 keV corresponds to the 
polyamide layer. At positron incident energies higher than 1.5 keV, τ3 curve jumps to 
higher values because the positron penetrates into the dense layer of the mPAN support 
membrane. The o-Ps annihilation trend of IP-I (Figure 5 (b)) is similar to that for the 
TFC membrane prepared via IP-II.

Conclusion 
In this study, polyamide TFC membranes were successfully prepared via two 
different interfacial polymerization procedures for reacting TETA and TMC on the 
surface of mPAN membranes. Based on the results of the SEM, AFM, and water 
contact angle experiments, the polyamide TFC membrane prepared via IP-II showed 
lower surface roughness, lower surface area, and lower hydrophilicity than that 
prepared via IP-I. The results of the positron annihilation studies indicated that thinner 
thickness, smaller free-volume size, and higher free-volume concentration were 
obtained for the polyamide layer prepared via IP-II. And from the results of the 
pervaporative separation of a 70 wt% isopropanol aqueous solution at 25oC, the 
respective separation factor and the permeation rate for the polyamide TFC membrane 
prepared via IP-II were higher than those for TFC membrane prepared via IP-I.
