Next, the definitions about the Coloured Petri Nets and the 
basic concepts of Coloured Petri Nets are introduced.  They 
are going to be presented here in a compact way and follow 
the original definitions in [14].  Firstly, the definitions of 
Coloured Petri Nets are described as follows. 
Definition 1: CPN = (Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I)                (1) 
satisfying the following requirements: 
A. Σ is a finite set of non-empty types, called colour sets 
B. P is a finite set of places 
C. T is a finite set of transitions 
D. A is a finite set of arcs such that P ∩ T=P ∩ A=T ∩ A =φ  
E. N : A → P × T ∪ T × P is a node function 
F. C : P → Σ is a colour function 
G. G is a guard function. It is defined from T into expressions 
such that 
∀ t ∈  T : [Type(G(t)) = Bool ∧ Type(Var(G(t))) ⊆ Σ] 
H. E is an arc function. It is defined from A into expressions 
such that 
∀ a ∈  A: [Type(E(a)) = C(p(s))MS∧ Type(Var(E(a))) ⊆ 
Σ]  
where p(a) is the place of N(a) and CMS denotes the set of 
all multi-sets over C 
I. I is an initialization function. It is defined from P into 
expressions such that 
∀ p ∈  P : [Type(I(p)) = C(p)MS] 
Next, the definitions of timed CPN are introduced.  Most 
applications of CPN are used to ascertain the implementation 
of control logic in a system.  The timed CPN have the 
capability to describe the dynamic properties of a system in the 
time space.  A global clock is necessary in a timed CPN model.  
The global clock values represent the model time where they 
may either be discrete time (i.e., all clock values are integer 
numbers) or continuous time (i.e., all clock values are real 
numbers).  More precisely, each token has a time stamp on it.  
The time stamp describes the earliest model time at which the 
token can be moved by a binding element.  The current state 
of a net will be changed when a binding element occurs.  Then 
the next enabled binding element will occur when the global 
clock is greater than or equal to the time stamp of the token.  
Definition 2: A timed non-hierarchical CPN is a tuple: 
TCPN = (CPN, R, r0)                                                     (2) 
such that: 
A. CPN satisfy the requirement of a non-hierarchical CPN in 
(1), when in H and I we allow the type of E(a) and I(p) to 
be a timed or an untimed multi-set over C(p(a)) and C(p), 
respectively. 
B. R is a set of timed values, also called time stamps.  It is a 
subset of R closed under + and containing 0. 
C. r0 is an element of R, called the start time. 
III. CRITICAL CHAIN SCHEDULING 
The main problems of project delay, which are add hidden 
safety duration, student’s syndrome and multi-tasking.  In 
order to solve these problems, the Critical Chain Scheduling 
(CCS), derived from the Theory of Constraints (TOC), is 
applied to project in order to improve performance and make 
project scheduling more effective than traditional scheduling 
methods as CPM /PERT.  There are five steps shown how 
TOC apply to project scheduling [3], [6], [15]. 
1. Identify the system’s constraint.  The primary work is to 
find out the weakest activity.  It is the same mean to find 
out a constraint in TOC.  The steps are as follows. 
1) To look over the activities’ duration and resources in a 
project network, and requires the non-critical activities as 
late as possible.  
2) To identify the resource conflicts and resolve them.  
3) To rearrange the activities conflicted by the resources or 
avoid the conflict by increasing resources.  
4) To repeat the step 2 to step 3, until all the resource conflicts 
are resolved. 
5) The longest chain, in terms of time, of dependent activities 
where the dependences are a result of considering resources 
usability in advance is the critical chain 
2. Decide how to exploit the system’s constraint.  The total 
duration of a project is the aggregation of the critical chain 
activities.  The answer for project still run late with all that 
safety is that the safety is wasted.  In order to reduce the 
abusive safety and makes the length of the critical chain 
shorter, to cut down an activity’s duration is necessary.  
Furthermore, sum the individual safety times on the critical 
chain and each non-critical chain as a buffer.   The purpose 
of the buffer is to protect the critical chain against the 
influence of uncertainty. 
3. Subordinate everything else to above decision.  The purpose 
of this step is that a task completes on the critical chain and 
begins the next task as soon as possible.  Therefore, we may 
protect the critical chain and project execution by increasing 
resource buffer and feeding buffer.  The feeding buffer 
being used to protect critical chain from disruption of other 
chains, the resource buffer being used to notify scheduler of 
a new resource on critical chain being employed. 
4. Elevate the system’s constraint.  Based on this definition of 
critical chain illustrated in stpe1, we can reduce the time on 
the critical chain to elevate the system’s constraint.  And 
sum the time as a project buffer for maintaining the project 
completion date to meet the project target.

Figure 7.  The OG of CPN-SSC model 
The OG of CPN-SSC model is shown in the Fig. 7.  It is 
worthy to notice that each node represents a marking, and the 
content of the marking is described by the text inscription of 
the node.  And each arc represents the occurrence of a binding 
element, and the content of this binding element is described 
by the text attached to the arc.  For example, the text D1=4 and 
D2=5 are used to describe the node N8.  The “D1=4” means 
that the windows and doors have torn down and the durations 
consumed are four days in the critical chain. Similarly, the 
“D2=4” represents that the windows and doors have ordered 
and the durations consumed are four days in the other chain.  
Notice that the end node N27 represents that the OG returns to 
the initial node (i.e., node N1). 
From this analysis, it can be concluded that: 1) there are no 
dead-end node in the OG, therefore the net is live; 2) the net is 
reversible we can always find an occurring sequence that bring 
the system back to the initial marking. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
It is a new concept that the CCS discusses the human 
behavior’s problem in project management. Especially, it is 
an innovation and new ideal to construction management 
domain.  To summarize, this paper has identified various 
benefits of the model. 
1. CPN-CCS is presented as a formal modeling tool that can 
be employed as a construction process modeling and 
analysis tool. And then the applications of CPN to CCS 
procedure have been realized. 
2. For both experts and non-experts, it is easy to explain that 
the proposed approach is the clear presentation of the 
system behavior and readiness for implementation. 
3. Structural analysis of CPN-CCS models was performed.
