overestimation of noises. To resolve this problem, harmonic regeneration (HR) (Plapous et al., 2006) was integrated 
into our approach. Thus, by regenerating the omitted harmonics, HR is able to reproduce well a fully harmonic 
signal. 
The rest of this study is organized as follows. Section II describes the FBMCRA approach, including the 
forward-backward estimation, MCRA, LSA, and HR. Section III then conducts a series of experiments to examine 
the performance of our approach using both subjective and objective measures. Finally, conclusions are drawn in 
Section IV, along with recommendations for future research. 
 
2. Forward-Backward Minima Controlled Recursive Averaging 
 
In this section, our approach, FBMCRA, which is based on forward-backward estimation, minima controlled 
recursive averaging, LSA, and HR is introduced. First, forward-backward estimation is used to estimate the noise 
component by averaging the past and next spectral power values. Second, to compensate for bias, the result is 
multiplied by a factor that is estimated by LSA. According to the speech presence probability, a time-varying 
frequency dependent smoothing parameter is then used to implement the recursive averaging in order to track the 
nonstationary noises. Finally, HR is applied to reduce the harmonic distortion and improve speech intelligibility. 
These procedures are illustrated serially in the following subsections. 
A. Forward-Backward Minimum-Controlled Estimation 
An estimator for the noise power spectrum under speech presence uncertainty is derived in this subsection. A 
noisy speech x(t) is the sum of a clean speech s(t) and an uncorrelated additive noise n(t). By taking a FFT, we have 
( ) ( ) ( ), , ,X k l S k l N k l= +  (1) 
where k and l are the frequency bin and frame index. Two hypotheses, H0 and H1, are used to indicate speech 
absence and presence and assumed to be

A common noise estimation technique is then applied, namely temporal recursive smoothing, to the noise 
measurement during the periods of speech absence, and hold this estimate during speech presence. Then, the Eq. (2) 
can be rewritten as

where αd is the smoothing parameter. 0H ′  and 1H ′  are also used to designate hypothetical speech absence and 
presence, respectively. A posteriori probability for speech presence P’(k, l) is applied to predict the confidence of 
hypothesis 1H ′ . In addition, backward estimation is used to track the beginning of nonstationary noise. Then, the Eq. 
(3) for forward-backward estimation can be rewritten as

Finally, to avoid annoying residual noise, the maximum value in forward estimation and backward estimation is 
selected as the estimated noise power and defined as follows:

Finally, the probability of speech absence q(k, l) can also be estimated by the priori SNR ξ(k, l). Since the speech is

3. Experimental Results and Discussion 
 
In this study, fifty test sentences that were spoken by different persons (half male and half female) were 
selected from TCC300 (Chen, 2011) and used to evaluate performance. The average number of words and speaking 
rate of these sentences are about 13.24 (words) and 3.67 (words per second), respectively. To create the stationary 
noise environments, factory, babble, and F16 cockpit noise were randomly selected from NOISEX-92. For 
nonstationary noise environments, we used actual recorded noises, namely a street (car passing noise), a train station 
(train passing noise), and an airport (airplane passing noise). Those noises were added to the test speeches at 0dB, 
5dB, and 10dB SNR conditions in order to examine the performance of our approach. 
For hearing aids, complexity is an important issue and therefore model-free based speech enhancement 
approaches are considered in this study. Thus, MCRA as proposed by Cohen (Cohen, 2003) was implemented as the 
baseline system. MCRA, which integrates spectral subtraction (SS) and LSA, was evaluated using a quantitative 
comparison using both stationary and nonstationary noise environments. The values of the parameters used in the 
implementation of MCRA estimators and FBMCRA estimators are summarized in Table I. 
 
A. The Analyses of Forward-Backward MCRA Using Simulation Noises 
In this subsection, the effect of the beginning of nonstationary noise was verified by a simulated noise, namely 
white noise. In MCRA, the minimum noise component of current frame and past searching space is selected as the 
estimated noise. Fig. 1(a) shows an example, in which the estimated noise is not sensitive to the beginning of 
nonstationary noise but is very sensitive to the end of noise. However, we find if a backward estimation is used to 
process it, then the estimated noise can be sensitive to the beginning of nonstationary noise as shown in Fig. 1(b). 
Generally, the speaking rate is about three words per seconds in Mandarin. 
To integrate the benefit of forward and backward estimation, the maximum value in both results was applied to 
find a good result in this study. Fig. 2 shows a result for the forward-backward estimation method. At about 3 
seconds, the noise is not estimated sensitively. The sensitivity is affected by the searching space of FBMCRA in Eq. 
(12) and Eq. (16). To resolve this problem, a small searching space should be chosen to quickly track the noise. 
However, speech may also be treated as nonstationary noise and thus suppressed in these circumstances. The 
example shows that it is very important to balance sensitivity and speech intelligibility. 
An optimum result must be estimated from the next frames and therefore backward estimation is not suitable 
for real time applications. To achieve a practicable approach, the local region for forward estimation is also treated 
as the local region for backward estimation. Fig. 3 shows an example estimated by backward estimation. Comparing 
Fig. 3(a) (Fig. 3(b)) with Fig. 1(b) (Fig. 2(b)), it can be seen that such an approach may lead to overestimation. Thus, 
if HR is integrated to our approach, speech intelligibility and the usability should be improved. 
From the above figures, it is clear that noise estimated at a descended noise margin is more correct than noise 
estimated at a raising noise margin. The reason is that a minimum energy Cmin(k, l) from past and searching space is 
used to quickly track the noise. Thus, the noise with a high power at the beginning and end of speech can be 
correctly estimated. 
 
B. The Analysis of Forward-Backward MCRA Using Noise Examples 
Next, a test sentence with different noises was adopted to examine the effect of stationary and nonstationary 
noises. The test sentence (shown in Fig. 4(a)) is “有一群漂亮的大鳥從灌木林裏飛出來”, which in pinyin is “you3 
yi4 qun2 piao4 liang4 de5 da4 niao3 cong2 guan4 mu4 lin2 li3 fei1 chu1 lai2” and it has the English meaning “A 
8 
 
The scores are averaged and are presented in Table II, which shows that FBMCRA-LSA and FBMCRA-LSA-HR 
were able to improve the overall quality across all noise conditions. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
For hearing aids, computational complexity and size are limited, thus model-free based single channel speech 
enhancement approaches are a very suitable means of improve their performance. In this work, an innovative 
approach, which is suitable for hearing aids, is proposed to improve speech intelligibility by tracking and 
suppressing nonstationary noises. Forward-backward estimation is able to correctly track nonstationary noises, 
especially for the beginning of nonstationary noises. Moreover, LSA was selected as the gain function for the 
FBMCRA and is able to effectively estimate the power spectrum of any noise. Finally, we integrate HR into our 
approach in order to further reduce the overestimation of noises and improve speech intelligibility. 
The proposed approach is a model-free based speech enhancement approach and the computation is based on 
recursive averaging and speech presence probability. Thus, the computational complexity is very suitable for 
hearing aids. Without model constrains, the users with hearing aids will be easily able to adjust to different 
environments. With different noise environments, the experimental results demonstrate that FBMCRA with HR is 
actually able to improve performance relative to other enhancement approaches using both objective and subjective 
measures. However, speech intelligibility may be slightly damaged in quiet environment. In addition, rapid changes 
in noise may cause the tracking process to become invalid. To resolve this problem, an environment detection 
system might be developed for hearing aids. Using this, according to the environment, it should be possible to adjust 
the tracking speed of the FBMCRA-HR. In the future, we will extend FBMCRA to become a real-time approach for 
hearing aids.

B. Voronoi-Diagram Construction 
A Voronoi diagram of P is a set of points in Euclidean 
space and it is the subdivision of the k-dimensional space into n 
(n≥2) Voronoi cells. For each codeword pi, the Voronoi cell 
C(pi) is a set of points and defined as 
 ( ) ( ) ( ){ }, ,i n n i n ji jC p p d p p d p p≠= <  (1) 
where pj is any other codeword in P and  
 ( ),i j i jd p p p p= − . (2) 
Therefore, the boundary of two Voronoi cell is called a 
Voronoi edge, and an endpoint of a Voronoi edge is called a 
Voronoi vertex. 
In this study, we select m principal components as the 
projection axes. All the codewords in P are projected onto this 
plan. With the Voronoi diagram, it is easily to find whether 
two points are one-ripple neighbor when they share the same 
Voronoi edge. Hence, an adjacency list of pi by one round 
neighbor-ripple of the codewords can be generated. According 
to the adjacency list, we can identify a search domain from a 
codeword pi. The search domain can also be extended by 
ripple-like extension operation. For example, the two-ripple 
neighbors of C(pi) contain one round neighbor-ripple and one 
round neighbor-ripple of these one-ripple neighbors. 
In order to find the closest point pi named initial codeword, 
a binary search algorithm is performed on the first principal 
component. Finally we can compute the best matching 
codeword by Euclidean distance in the search domain. In 
order to make the optimal codeword as close as possible to the 
results of FSVQ, a codeword duplication mechanism is used 
to improve the adjacency list. Using FSVQ, we can find the 
best matching codeword pf. If pf doesn’t in the search domain 
of the initial codeword pi, the codeword pf will be added to the 
adjacency list of pi. The procedure is shown as follows. 
Preprocessing and Training Procedure 
Step 1. Use PCA technique to project codebook onto a space 
of m-dimensional. 
Step 2. Build a Voronoi diagram by the projected plan. 
Step 3. Generate the neighbor-ripple adjacency-list of each 
codeword. 
Step 4. Use FSVQ to find the initial codewords. 
Step 5. Project each training data onto this plane. 
Step 6. Determine the best codeword for each training vector 
by FSVQ. 
Step 7. If the initial codeword is not the best codeword, add 
the best codeword into the neighbor-ripple 
adjacency-list of the initial codeword. 
Step 8. Repeat step 4 to step 7 until all training vectors are 
done. 
C. Greedy Search Procedure 
Greedy search method will take the optimum solution in 
each searching state. A testing data px will be project onto the 
plan by PCA. According to the first principal component, a 
binary search is applied to find the initial codeword Ci. With 
Ci, the neighbor codeword in the adjacency list are used to 
find the closest codeword. When the closest codeword is 
found, it is treat as a new initial codeword and repeat this 
procedure until reaching a predefined condition. 
In this study, two conditions were proposed. First one is 
vector searching procedure with cutoff. In this approach, the 
search will be stop when the distances of vectors in adjacency 
list are greater than that of initial codeword. Another one is to 
define the number of ripples in the search domain and named 
as vector searching procedure without cutoff. In this approach, 
we will find the closest codeword in the greedy search space. 
Those two approaches are show as follows for more detail. 
Vector Searching Procedure with Cutoff 
Step 1. Use PCA to project the input vector px onto the same 
space. 
Step 2. Use binary search to find the initial codeword Ci of px. 
Step 3. Let the best codeword Cb is equal to Ci. 
Step 4. Find the closest codeword Cc in adjacency-list of Ci. 
Step 5. If Cc is closer than Cb, then let Cb=Cc and Ci=Cc else 
goto step 7. 
Step 6. Repeat step 4 and step 5 until the predefined number 
of ripples is reached. 
Step 7. Return the best codeword Cb. 
Vector Searching Procedure without Cutoff 
Step 1. Use PCA to project the input vector px onto the same 
space. 
Step 2. Use binary search to find the initial codeword Ci of px. 
Step 3. Let the best codeword Cb is equal to Ci. 
Step 4. Find the closest codeword Cc in adjacency-list of Ci. 
Step 5. If Cc is closer than Cb, then let Cb=Cc  
Step 6. Let Ci=Cc. 
Step 7. Repeat step 4 and step 6 until the predefined number 
of ripples is reached. 
Step 8. Return the best codeword Cb. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
In this study, a codebook generated from TCC300 [13] was 
used to evaluate the performance of proposed approach. In this 
codebook, the dimension of codebook is 39 dimensions 
containing 13 mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC), 13 delta 
MFCC, and 13 delta delta MFCC. The size of codebook is 
2048. Besides, there are 6654 vectors and 3026 vectors for the 
training and testing database, respectively. 
A. The Analysis of Dimension of Voronoi-Diagram 
In order to analyze the effect of dimension of Voronoi 
diagram, FSVQ is chosen as the baseline system and it is the 
optimal results. The distortion between testing data and 
codeword is measured by Euclidean distance. Besides, the 
number of compared codewords named count is also used in 
supporting this research under Contract No. 100-2221-E-218-
005.

B. Voronoi-Diagram Construction 
A Voronoi diagram of P is a set of points in Euclidean 
space and it is the subdivision of the k-dimensional space into n 
(n≥2) Voronoi cells. For each codeword pi, the Voronoi cell 
C(pi) is a set of points and defined as 
 ( ) ( ) ( ){ }, ,i n n i n ji jC p p d p p d p p≠= <  (1) 
where pj is any other codeword in P and  
 ( ),i j i jd p p p p= − . (2) 
Therefore, the boundary of two Voronoi cell is called a 
Voronoi edge, and an endpoint of a Voronoi edge is called a 
Voronoi vertex. 
In this study, we select m principal components as the 
projection axes. All the codewords in P are projected onto this 
plan. With the Voronoi diagram, it is easily to find whether 
two points are one-ripple neighbor when they share the same 
Voronoi edge. Hence, an adjacency list of pi by one round 
neighbor-ripple of the codewords can be generated. According 
to the adjacency list, we can identify a search domain from a 
codeword pi. The search domain can also be extended by 
ripple-like extension operation. For example, the two-ripple 
neighbors of C(pi) contain one round neighbor-ripple and one 
round neighbor-ripple of these one-ripple neighbors.

codeword by Euclidean distance in the search domain. In 
order to make the optimal codeword as close as possible to the

to improve the adjacency list. Using FSVQ, we can find the
