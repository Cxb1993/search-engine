2四、研究方法
4.1. Chemicals
Isolated soy protein (ISP) was purchased from Gemfont Company (Taipei, Taiwan).
Neutrase 0.5 L (0.5 units/g) was obtained from Novo Nordisk A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark).
HPLC standards including cytochrome c, aprotinin, gastrin I, substance P, and (glycine)3 with
molecular weight 125,000, 6,500, 2,126, 1,329.8 and 189 daltons, respectively, were purchased
from Merck (Damdstadt, Germany) or Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Polyethersulfone spiral-wound membranes with molecular weight cut-off 1-30 kDa and with
membrane area 0.2 m2 were purchased from Osmonics Inc. (California, USA). Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and all tissue culture materials were from Gibco (Grand Island,
New York, USA). Fetal bovine serum was from Biological Industries (Kibbutz Beit Haemek,
Israel).
4.2. Preparations of Neutrase-ISP hydrolysates (NH)
The 2.5% (w/v) ISP and 1% (w/ w of ISP) Neutrase were employed to produce and compare
each hydrolysate with GPDH activity and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. The optimum
conditions of temperature and pH for Neutrase was 45 and℃ 6.0 according to the internal
document of the supplier. Samples, withdrawn at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 h, were immediately heated in a
boiling water bath for 10 min. Parts of each heated sample were used to determine degree of
hydrolysis (DH) using the ortho- phthaldialdehyde (OPA) method (Church et al., 1983 ). The rest
of each heated sample was subjected to centrifugation at 8000 xg in a microcentrifuge for 15min.
The supernatants were freeze-dried and assayed for GPDH activity and lipid accumulation in
3T3-L1 cells.
4.3. Fractionation of selected NH with ultra-filtration membranes
Selected NH was subjected to ultra-filtration using a spiral-wound membrane with 10 kDa, 3
kDa and 1 kDa molecular weight cut-off, sequentially. Each concentrate or permeate was collected
and freeze-dried to determine its protein concentration, profile of molecular weight distribution,
and to feed cell culture.
4.4. Cell culture
The 3T3-L1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were seeded in 24-well
4water and stained using 0.3% Oil Red O in isopropanol for 15 min at room temperature.
Preliminary study indicated that the absorbance of the dye-TG complex was proportional to
concentration of TG present in each sample (data not shown) at 540 nm. Relative lipid
accumulation (RLA, %) was expressed as:
Ac - As
RLA (%) = ––––––––––––––– X 100 (1)
Ac
Where Ac is the absorbance of control cell culture; As is the absorbance of treatment 1 or
treatment 2 cell culture.
4.6. Assay for GPDH activity
On day 8 after differentiation, 3T3-L1 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and
harvested into 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT . Cells were
disrupted by sonication and then centrifuged at 12,000 xg for 20 min at 4 . The s℃ upernatants were
analyzed for GPDH activity according to the procedure of Wise and Green (1979). Protein
concentration was measured using BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). One
unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of protein required for the use of 1 nmol NADH
min-1 mg protein-1.
4.7. Molecular weight distribution
The molecular weight distribution of the hydrolysate was analyzed using high-performance
size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The HPSEC was equipped with Superdex HR 10/30
column (Amersham Biosciences Ltd., Pittsburgh, PA., USA ) connected to a UV detector
(Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) set at 214 nm. The mobile phase was 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH
7.2) containing 0.25 M NaCl and flow rate was set at 0.5 mL/min.
4.8. Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as means with SEM. Differences were assessed for statistical
significance using Student’s t-test. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05.
五、結果與討論
5.1. Limited hydrolysis of ISP to decrease lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 cells differentiation
Figure 1 shows the effects of hydrolysis time on degree of hydrolysis (DH, %) and yield.
Isolated soy protein (ISP) was hydrolyzed by Neutrase for 0.5-6 h. Both DH and yield increased
6significantly decreased from 270 to 120 U/mg protein (p < 0.05). By comparison of HPLC
profile, the most active peptide for anti-adipogenic were primarily composed of small peptides
with molecular weight between 1,300 and 2,200 Da (Fig. 5). The result indicated that NH4h
could be further enhanced its triglyceride-lowering activity by filtrating with 10kd MWCO
membrane to remove larger peptides > 6,500 Da to obtain 10kDa permeate, which was further
filtered with 1 kDa MWCO membrane to obtain 1 kDa concentrate.
The 1 kDa concentrate also exerts a dose-dependent reduction of GPDH activity at day 8 during
3T3-L1 cell differentiation (Fig. 6). The GPDH activity decreased as the level of the concentrate
increased for both treatments. As dosage of the concentrate increased to 400 ppm, the GPDH
activity was significantly decreased from 514 to less than 200 U/mg protein for both treatments.
Again, the result revealed that 1 kDa concentrate expressed its triglyceride-lowering activity at the
early phase of cell differentiation.
