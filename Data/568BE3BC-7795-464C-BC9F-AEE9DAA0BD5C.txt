Chapter 2 Literature Review 
2.1 Review of Nitride Based Hard Coating  
Hard coating material can be categorized into three regimes 
according to the chemical bonding characteristics (including metallic, 
covalent and ionic bondings), which was proposed by Holleck as shown 
in Fig. 2.2. Table 2.1 shows representative materials in these three kinds 
of groups. Among these hard coatings, the transition metal nitrides 
consisting of a mixture of covalent, ionic and metallic bonding structure 
are responsible for high hardness, chemical inertness, good wear 
resistance and thermal stability. The interest in the transition metal nitride 
is growing rapidly for such diverse applications as hard coating on cutting 
tool, pressing molding, diffusion barrier in integrated circuit and optical 
mirror for high energy XRD.

2.1.1 Metastable TiAlN and CrAlN Coating 
CrAlN ternary coating is a promising candidate to replace the 
commercial TiAlN coatings due to its superior properties as listed: 
(1) High critical content of cubic-AlN phase 
In the TiAlN coating, the oxidation resistance and hardness 
properties can be further increased with increasing Al content.  However, 
there is a critical solubility of cubic-AlN in the TiN coating around 50%.  
As AlN content is above the solubility limit, the wurtzite-AlN phase will 
be formed in the TiAlN coating. The mechanical hardness, oxidation 
resistance and wear resistance of TiAlN coating all degrades rapidly as 
compared to cubic TiAlN phase. The phase change in pseudobinary 
transition metal aluminum nitrides have been evidenced by either 
experiments or theory. As shown in Table 2.3, Makino proposed that the 
solubility limit of AlN in CrN could reach 77.2%, as predicted by band 
parameters method based on the concept of localized electron theory, 
which was the largest one among all binary transition metal nitrides (Fig. 
2.6 and Table 2.3).

film after oxidation at 800 oC for 5 hrs

Despite of poor oxidation resistance of TiAlN coating in air, the hot 
hardness of TiAlN can be further enhanced up to 900 oC due to the 
spinodal decomposition of cubic TiN and cubic AlN at elevated 
temperatures in vacuum and Ar purged environment, which is proved by 
the X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis.  
The mechanical hardness of CrAlN coating is higher than that of 
TiAlN coating with identical content of Al, as evidenced by Wuhrer. The 
hardness of CrAlN coating increases with the Al content up to about 77%, 
which is the maximum solubility of cubic-AlN in the CrN film and then 
decreases due to the formation of hexagonal AlN in the CrAlN coatings, 
which is similar to the result in the TiAlN coatings. The thermal stability 
study of CrAlN coating with different Al addition has pronounced in 
recent year as commercial products on the high performance cutting tools 
at elevated temperatures. Fig. 2.9 indicates that three reactions can be 
formed in the CrAlN coatings with different Al content, as listed in the 
following: 
(1) transformation of fcc-CrAlN to hcp-CrAlN 
(2) segregation of Cr2N 
(3) segregation of pure Cr 
The segregation of hcp-CrAlN and Cr2N in the CrAlN coating in reaction 
(1) and (2) starts at 900oC around 0.21 at.% Al and shifts to higher 
temperatures until 1000oC for higher Al content. The reaction (3) 
corresponding to the segregation of Cr is formed at 1000 oC and can not 
be influenced by the addition of Al content. The hardness degradation of  
  16
CrAlN coating as function of Al content is mainly caused by the 
decompositions of hcp-CrAlN and Cr phases. 
2.1.2 Superhard Nanocomposite 
    Superhard nanocomposite coatings consist of 3–5 nm small 
nanocrystallites of a hard transition metal nitride, such as TiN, (Ti1-xAlx)N 
and nc-(Al1-xCrx)N “glued” together by about one-monolayer of Si3N4, 
whose ideal shear and de-cohesion strength is higher than that of bulk 
SiNx. These coatings, when correctly prepared, posses an unusual 
combination of mechanical properties, such as a high hardness of 40 to 
100 GPa, high elastic recovery of 80 % to 94 %, elastic strain limit of > 
10%, and high tensile strength of 10 to ≧40 GPa, that is approaching the 
ideal strength of flow-free materials. This dual-phase nanostructure is 
successfully evidenced in nc-TiN/a-Si3N4 system by transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) in Fig. 2.10. 
2.1.2.1 Formation of the Nanostructure by Spinodal Phase Segregation 
   The concept of superhard nanocomposite is beased on a strong, 
thermodynamically driven, and diffusion rate-controlled (spinodal) phase 
segregation that leads to the formation of a stable nanostructure by 
self-organization. The spinodal phase segregation occurs in a mixed 
binary system A1-xBx, when the second derivative of the Gibbs free 
energy of the mixed phase is negative: 
 
d G x
dx
M2
2 0
Δ ( ) <                       (2.2) 
(ΔG M  is the difference between the Gibbs free energy of a mole of the  
  18
homogeneous solution and the Gibbs free energy of the corresponding 
numbers of moles of the unmixed components.)  This is just the opposite 
condition of thermodynamic stability (i.e., equilibrium) that requires 
ΔG M  to be a minimum, i.e., the second derivative to be positive. This is 
illustrated in Fig. 2.11 for the lower curve (T1) within the whole range of 
the composition and for the upper one (T2) for the range between the 
composition x1 and x2. The latter curve (T2) corresponds to the case of a 
low activity (partial pressure) of nitrogen for the given deposition 
temperature of 500-600 oC and/or too high temperature where the 
decomposition of stoichiometric nitrides commences (for TiN and Si3N4 
above about 1000 oC in vacuum). 
2.1.2.2 Requirements for Complete Phase Segregation during Deposition 
The nanocomposites with excellent mechanical properties can be 
synthesized only under the conditions which allow the system to undergo 
spinodal phase segregation and the formation of a nanostructure with 
sharp interface and of high purity.  However, it should be noticed that 
phase segregations are thermodynamically driven and kinetically 
controlled by diffusion. Even strongly thermodynamically driven phase 
segregation can be kinetically hindered if the temperature is not 
sufficiently high. Veprek and Zhang further discussed the kinetic 
constrains by ab initio calculation and raised 3 criteria for the complete 
phase separation： 
(1)High deposition temperature  
(2)High nitrogen partial pressure  
  20
(3)Low oxygen impurities 
2.1.2.3 The Role of Oxygen Impurity 
In addition to kinetic reasons (low temperature and low nitrogen 
pressure) during the deposition, oxygen impurities are identified as the 
most serious obstacle for the nanocomposite structure.  The strength 
(and hardness) of the nanocomposites is expected to increase with 
decreasing density of flaws in the material. As shown in Fig. 2.12, 
obviously, the strength (and hardness) of the nanocomposites with oxygen 
content of >0.5 at.% is limited by the strength of that contaminated 
interface. It is reported by Veprek et al that at an oxygen impurity content 
as low as 0.4 at. %, as shown in Fig. 2.13, the maximum achievable 
hardness in these coatings is less than 40 GPa.

Fig. 3.1 Flowchart of the fabrication and characterization of nitride 
coatings 
  26
nitride films were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering onto both 
carbon tool steel (Fe:98.6 wt.%, C:0.8 wt.%, Mn:0.4 wt.%, Cr:0.2 wt.%) 
substrates and Si (100) wafers with a HEA (high entropy alloy) target.  
The high-entropy alloy of Ti-Al-Cr-Si-V was fabricated by arc melting 
method with the molar ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 under a purified argon gas 
atmosphere, and was shaped into discs of 50 mm in diameter and 6 mm in 
thickness as a target. Characteristics of the selected elements Ti, Al, Cr, Si, 
V, and their nitrides are listed in Table 3.1.  Process of fabricating the 
HEA ingot was described in details in the literature.   
Before sputtering process, the chamber was evacuated down to 8 × 
10-4 Pa and the samples were heated to 300 oC for 2 hour.  To have a 
clean surface, the HEA target was pre-sputtered by Ar plasma for 5 min 
with a RF power of 200W.  After cleaning, the RF power was increased 
to 250 W and the gun shutter was opened for 2.5 hour deposition.  
Nitrogen was introduced as a reactive gas and adjusted within the range 
of 0~30 sccm for acquiring various nitride coatings.   
3.2.2 Deposition of CrAlSiN Coatings 
The CrAlSixN nitride coatings were deposited by reactive RF 
sputtering onto AISI 420 steel (Fe:Balance, C:0.15 wt.%, Mn:1.0 at.%, 
Si:1.0 at.%, Cr:12-14 wt.%, P:0.04 wt.%, S:0.03 wt.%) and carbon tool 
steel (Fe:98.6 wt.%, C:0.8 wt.%, Mn:0.4 wt.%, Cr:0.2 wt.%) substrates 
with CrAl and Si targets.  The deposition apparatus is shown in Fig. 3.3.  
During the reactive sputtering process, the chamber was firstly evacuated 
down to 2 × 10-4 Pa and heated to 300 oC for 3 hour.  In prior to reactive

0.15418 nm was generated from a Cu target operated at 40 kV and 30 mA.  
The high angle 2θ scan ranged from 30 to 70 degree with a step width of 
0.02o at 1o/min.  
The bonding characteristics of the multi-component coatings were 
analyzed by ESCA (Ulvac-PHI PHI 1600) with an Mg Kα radiation 
source. 
3.3.3 Nanohardness and Elastic Modulus Evaluation 
Hardness of various nitride coatings were measured by a 
nanoindentation tester (Nano Hardness Tester, CSM Instrument, 
Switzerland).  The nanoindenter was equipped with a Berkovich 142.3° 
diamond probe tip, 3-sided pyramidal indenter.  The load was fixed at 5 
mN and the indentation depth was smaller than 1/10 of the coating 
thickness.  The loading and unloading rates of the nanoindentation were 
all set to be 1 mN/s.  The holding time was 5 s.  The nano hardness and 
elastic modulus of each indent was determined based on the Oliver and 
Pharr method. 
3.3.4 Investigation of the Tribological Behavior 
The tribological behaviors of the coatings were evaluated by a 
pin-on- disc tester. The coatings were worn by an Al2O3 rigid ball with a 
tangential velocity of 0.125 m/sec. The applied loading was 2 N. The 
sliding distance was set to be 150 m.

906).  A tweezers was used to squeeze out epoxy so that only a thin 
layer of epoxy, about 0.1 μm, was left between the samples. Two 
protective silicon wafers were also cut into 3 mm x 2 mm 
rectangular pieces and bonded on a blank silicon pieces. 
(4) The stack was then mounted on a blank silicon pieces. 
(5) Sample assembly was polished side way sequentially with a 1200 
grit abrasive paper, 15 μm and 3 μm diamond pastes. 
(6) The polished surface of stack was then mounted with a thin layer of 
crystal bond on a glass pieces. 
(7) The new specimen assembly was grinded from silicon side less than 
10 μm thick using 400-, 800-, and 1200-grit abrasive papers and 3 
μm diamond pastes in succession. 
(8) A copper mesh, 3 mm in diameter, was bonded by epoxy to the 
sample stack. 
(9) The silicon material and wax outside the boundary of copper mesh 
were removed by a tweezers. 
(10) To dissolve the crystal bond and wax with acetone.  The sample 
stacked on copper ring was then detached from the glass piece. 
Finally, the exposed side of the sample was bonded by epoxy to 
another copper mesh. 
(11)Both surfaces of the sample stack were milled by argon ions until a 
hole was developed near the center of the samples.  The argon ion 
energy, milling angle, and ion current were 4-5 keV, 3-8o, and 
50-200 μA, respectively.

Chapter 4 Results and Discussions 
Part 1 Microstructure Evolution and Mechanical Properties of 
Multi-component Ti-Al-Cr-Si-V Nitride Coatings Derived 
from RF Magnetron Sputtering 
4.1.1 Composition of the Target and Sputtered Films 
The chemical compositions of the HEA target and sputtered films 
were determined by FE-EPMA and are listed in Table 4.1.  In the 
quantitative analysis of the target, a probe size of 50 μm was selected and 
5 different points at least were measured for statistical merits.  However, 
large deviations, especially for Al and Si, were revealed in the 
composition of the high entropy alloy.  Fig. 4.1 illustrates the 
backscattered electron image (BEI) and the X-ray mapping of Cr, Al, and 
Si in the HEA target.  Two distinct regions could be distinguished.  The 
grey matrix (region Ι) was abundant in Cr and Al, while the white 
island-like region (region Ⅱ) was Si-rich.  The segregations were 
considered to be resulted from the ingot process and both regions were in 
the micro range.  It was believed that the large deviations in 
compositions derived from a 50 μm probe size were attributed to the 
phase separation in the HEA target. 
By using this HEA target in the RF magnetron sputtering, the 
metallic and nitride films (TiAlCrSiV)xNy were fabricated with thickness 
around 1.1~1.7 μm.  It was interesting to point out that in quantitative 
analyses of the sputtered coatings, standard deviations of composition

nano-grains and amorphous boundary.  As shown in Fig. 2.13, hardness 
would be decreased to around 30 GPa due to the extrinsic impurities.  
Although hardness was improved in this study, the enhanced values were 
still lower than the expected 40 GPa.  The deviation was attributed to the 
inevitable oxygen content, approximately 2 at.%, in the sputtering 
process. 
Since controlling oxygen impurities lower than 2 at.% was very 
difficult in sputtering, hardness was further increased by adjusting 
substrate bias in this study. Through the increasing ion bombardment, the 
coating with more compact structure, finer grain and higher compressive 
stress could be obtained. Fig. 4.7 shows the improved hardness of the 
(TiAlCrSiV)xNy coating fabricated with bias -100 V (designated as 
MCNb in the following text), and the maximum hardness reached 36.4 
GPa. The compositions of the MCb and MCNb coatings were listed in 
Table 4.2.  The detailed microstructure and strengthening mechanism 
would be discussed in Sec. 4.2. 
The favorable hardness exhibited by the multi-component nitride 
coatings was much higher than those of the binary nitrides with the 
selected elements.  Although high hardness around 30 GPa could be 
obtained by nanolayered structure of the binary nitride system, it was 
much more time-consuming for the deposition of multi-layers, and 
multi-gun technique was indispensable in the fabrication process.  
Relatively speaking, the nitride coatings derived by the HEA target in this 
study provided an alternative approach to effectively synthesize the hard 
nitride coatings.

Part 2 Oxidation Behavior of Multi-component Ti-Al-Cr-Si-V 
Nitride Coatings at Elevated Temperatures 
4.2.1 Microstructures of MCN Coatings 
In the previous section 4.1.3, the enhancement of hardness for the 
MCNb coatings fabricated with substrate bias was demonstrated.  
Especially, the MCNb 3 coating revealed highest hardness around 36.4 
GPa among all the samples.  Fig. 4.8 shows the XRD pattern of the 
multi-component coatings fabricated with substrate bias (designated as 
MCb and MCNb).  From the identified (111) and (200) peaks, the 
nanocrystalline feature of the MCNb 3 coating could be verified.  The 
detailed cross-sectional microstructure of the MCNb 3 coating was 
investigated by TEM, as shown in Fig. 4.9(a).  As compared with MCN 
3 coating, shown in Fig. 4.6 (a), the MCNb 3 exhibited a compact 
structure with fine grains rather than columnar ones.  The columnar 
feature was apparently altered after exerting substrate bias in the 
sputtering.  It was suggested that the increasing ion bombardment 
resulted in this grain refinement as well as the improved hardness.   
The MCNb 3 coating was then annealed at 600 oC, 700 oC and 800 
oC in air for 4 hours to evaluate its oxidation behavior.  After annealing 
treatments, oxides with various shapes were designated as #1 to #5, as 
shown in Figs 4.9(b), (c) and (d).  The region #1, as shown in Fig. 4.9(b), 
was considered as amorphous oxide layer due to its non-contrast feature.  
In the conventional TiAlN coatings, it was proposed that an amorphous 
oxide layer, such as Al2O3, could impede oxygen inward diffusion 
effectively due to the deficiency of diffusion path in grain boundaries.

Figure 4.11 shows the enlarged view of this area and the diffraction 
patterns of the Ti-rich and Ti-depleted phases.  According to the 
diffraction pattern, the plate-like oxide (#2) and spherical grains (#4) 
were identified to be TiO2 (JCPDS No. 82-0514) and CrVO4 (JCPDS No. 
84-1740), respectively.  From the magnified image, as shown in Fig. 
4.11(a), it was found that TiO2 phase grew out of the original smooth 
surface and left a Ti-depleted region.  This implied an outward diffusion 
of Ti on the surface at 700 oC.  Because of the crystallized structure, the 
CrVO4 layer might provide effective diffusion paths through grain 
boundaries.  Due to these diffusion paths, the oxidative phase no longer 
acted as a protection at this temperature.  Therefore, serious oxidation 
was expected at elevated temperature higher than 700 oC. Fig. 4.9(d) 
shows the 800 oC-annealed MCNb 3 coating.  It appeared that both 
CrVO4 and TiO2 phases grew larger after the heat treatment.   
In the TiAlVN monolayer and TiAlN/VN multilayered coatings, it 
was proposed that V2O5 would retard the formation of protective Al2O3 or 
Al2TiO5 and form the plate-like AlVO4 instead at elevated temperature 
higher than 600 oC. Hence, oxidation resistance of the nitride coating was 
deteriorated after the addition of V.  In this work, no AlVO4 phase was 
found.  Instead, spherical CrVO4 grains were verified on the annealed 
TiAlCrSiVN coatings.  Unlike the amorphous Al2O3 or SiO2 phases, the 
grain boundaries of CrVO4 phase could provide effective diffusion 
shortcuts.  Therefore, appreciable oxidation would occur due to the 
outward diffusion of Ti and inward diffusion of oxygen at elevated 
temperature. 
  56
4.2.3 Tribological Behavior of As-deposited and Annealed MCN Coatings 
Figure 4.12 depicts the result of pin-on-disc tests for the 
as-deposited and annealed MCNb 3 coating.  The as-deposited MCNb 3 
coating exhibited a low friction coefficient around 0.55.  Although the 
Al-contained nitrides were commonly oxidation resistant, high friction 
coefficients of the CrAlN and TiAlN coatings from 0.7 to 0.9 were 
reported and disfavored in the literatures. It was evidenced that the 
friction coefficients could be significantly reduced to about 0.6 by adding 
Si in these Al-contained coatings.  After Si addition, surface of the 
coating could be flattened by Si3N4-induced the grain refinements, 
improving the friction coefficient [105].  In addition, Si3N4 phase also 
acted as a self-lubricant by the following tribochemical reaction [104, 
106]: 
Si3N4+6H2OÆ3SiO2+4NH3                         (4.1) 
        SiO2+2H2OÆSi(OH)4                   (4.2) 
These reactions could take place with ambient humidity at room 
temperature.  Therefore, the improved friction coefficient of the 
as-deposited coating in this study was attributed to this mechanism.    
    On the other hand, the influence of the oxides on the tribological 
behavior was also evaluated.  After annealing at 600 oC for 30 minutes, 
the coating exhibited similar friction coefficient with that of the 
as-deposited nitride.  This implied the retained surface condition of the 
annealed coating, and the protection of the amorphous layer in the early 
stage of oxidation was manifested.  However, the friction coefficient of 
  58
the previous section 4.2.2, the increased friction coefficient was attributed 
to the lack of self-lubricated oxide, V2O5.  Since the friction coefficient 
around 0.6 reflected the influence of the oxides, it was shown that the 
tribological behavior at elevated temperature was not improved by the 
amorphous oxide layer.

in thick region in TEM.  However, these stripes were not found in the 
thinnest part (top of the layer) of CS/MC/MCN 3 coating, as shown in Fig. 
4.13(b). Elimination of structural defects was thus verified for those 
coatings with metallic interlayers.  This was in agreement with the 
reduced porosity rate calculated from Tafel measurement.  
Figure 4.14 demonstrates the potentiodynamic polarization curves of 
the coatings.  Small positive potential of 0.2 V was intentionally selected 
as the endpoint, so that the initial corrosive damages of the coatings could 
be observed.  At the scanning endpoint, current density of CS/MC/MCN 
3 sample was smaller than that of the monolayer coating, implying the 
lower corrosion rate for this coating at this potential.  Surface 
morphologies of the coatings after polarization tests are shown in Fig. 
4.15.  Large, irregular pitting holes distributed omnipresently on the 
surface of CS/MCN 3, and they were significantly suppressed in the 
CS/MC/MCN 3 sample.  In addition to lower porosity rate, 
film-breaking mechanism could be considered in the anodic polarization 
region [111]. Mechanical stresses at the weak site or surface tension 
effects might cause delaminations and accelerate the corrosion reaction.  
In Fig. 4.15(b), serial delaminations of the MCN 3 coating were found, 
which was contributed to the large and irregular pits.  In stead of 
large-scaled peeling, only small chips were revealed on the surface of 
CS/MC/MCN 3. The shapes of the pits were rounder and smaller, 
indicating the less degree of corrosion.  Therefore, an improved 
adhesion by MC interlayer was also suggested for the lower current 
density in anodic region.

In these coatings, the nitride grains could not grew continuously, so that 
accumulated intrinsic stress and strain energy would no longer dominate 
the preferred orientation, while surface energy did.  Consequently, grain 
growth along (200) direction, which possessed the lowest surface energy, 
as well as the fine-grain structure were expected in CrAlSiN coatings due 
to the incorporation of amorphous Si3N4 phase. Fig. 4.18 presents the 
cross-sectional TEM images of CrAlN and CrAlSiN coatings, which also 
supported the pre-sumptions from XRD patterns. The columnar structure 
of the CrAlN coating was observed, yet it switched to an equi-axis one 
with 11.5 at.% Si addition.  From the HR-image, the fine-grain structure 
with grain size smaller than 20nm of the CrAlSi11.5N coating was also 
observed. On the basis of the results from XRD patterns and TEM images, 
retardation of columnar growth by cooperated Si in the CrAlN coating 
was evident. 
4.4.2 EIS Measurements of AISI420/CrAlSixN and CS/CrAlSixN  
The results of EIS measurement were plotted as scattered points in 
Figs. 4.19 and 4.20. Except bare carbon tool steel substrates, the 
equivalent circuit model, shown in Fig. 4.19(a), was selected for curve 
fitting and quantitative studies. The fitting model for bare carbon tool 
steel was shown in Fig. 4.19(b). In the selected equivalent circuit, Rs 
corresponds to the solution resistance; Rpore represents the resistance of 
the coating layer resulted from the coating defects; and Rct is the charge 
transfer resistance of the coating/steel interface. The Qcoat and Qdl are the 
capacitance at the solution/coating and solution/substrate interface, 
respectively. Fig. 4.21 shows the fitting errors of various coating  
  74
 
Fig. 4.19 Bode phase plots of (a) AISI420/CrAlSixN  (b) CS/CrAlSixN 
 
  76
assemblies. The fitting errors for each coating/steel configuration were 
smaller than 8%, and the corresponding quantitative data was listed in 
Table 4.5. The fitted line was also plotted as dash line in Figs. 4.19 and 
4.20.   
    Figure 4.19(a) presents the Bode phase plot, which revealed the 
relationship between phase angle and exerted frequency for bare and 
coated AISI420 steels.  In comparison with the reported Bode phase plot 
of coated stainless steels in Liu’s studies, no “plateau” in the 
low-frequency region was observed for all the samples. In stead, the 
phase angle dropped drastically when the exerted frequency was smaller 
than 1 Hz.  Liu et al attributed the high phase angle in the low-frequency 
region to the formation of dense, passive film on the AISI316 steel. In 
comparison with AISI420 steel, AISI 316 steel contained more protective 
element, such as Cr (16-19 wt.%) and Ni (10-16 wt.%), which were 
transformed to passive oxides easily, so that inferior corrosion resistance 
of AISI420 steel was expected. Since the electrochemical response of the 
localized pitting holes would be significant in the low-frequency region, 
the decrease on phase angle was attributed to the inferior corrosion 
resistance of AISI420 substrate.  In contrast to the proposed model with 
single time constant for AISI316 steels, the sub-circuit comprised of Qdl 
and Rct was necessary for accurate fitting of bare and coated AISI420 
stainless steels.   
    As shown in Fig. 4.20, the EIS data of steel/CrAlSixN samples were 
also presented as Nyquist plot, which was comprised of real and  
  78
imaginary parts of the impedance as a function of the applied frequency 
perturbation. A convenient way to evaluate the corrosion properties of the 
samples was to compare the diameters of the semi-circles in Nyquist plot. 
The larger the diameter is, the better corrosion resistance of the sample is 
expected. As shown in Fig. 4.19(a), CrAlN and CrAlSiN coated steels 
exhibited larger diameters than that of bare AISI420 substrates, and better 
corrosion resistant of these coated steels were evident. The quantitative 
data was given in Table 4.5, and it was found that the Rct of CrAlSi11.5N 
was 1.6 times greater than that of CrAlN. Superior corrosion resistance of 
AISI420/CrAlSiN configuration was thus demonstrated. 
    According to growth mechanism of fcc CrN coating as proposed by 
Chekour et al., a decrease on density of thick CrN coating (>500nm) was 
identified, which was attributed to the shadow effect of large conical 
columns during sputtering. The intercolumnar space in the thick coatings 
was considered as an effective diffusion path for electrolyte so that the 
columnar structure was disfavored in consideration of corrosion 
resistance. From XRD pattern and TEM observation, it was verified that 
the columnar growth could be eliminated by addition of Si, and a dense 
CrAlSiN coating with equi-axis grains was revealed.  Therefore, the 
effect of grain refinement, resulted from Si addition, was responsible for 
the significant increase of Rct in the CrAlSiN coatings.  
On the contrary, the enhancement on corrosion resistance was not 
revealed by the coatings deposited on the carbon tool steel substrates.  
As listed in Table 4.6, all the coated carbon tool steels exhibited similar 
Rct after immersing for 1 hour. Furthermore, all the CS/CrAlN and

Chapter 5 Conclusions 
1. The microstructures of the multi-component (TiAlCrSiV)xNy 
coatings were investigated.  The crystallized and stoichiometric 
nitrides, MCN 3~MCN 5, could be fabricated by inletting more than 
10 sccm N2 in the sputtering process.  These stoichiometric nitrides 
revealed an improved hardness higher than 30 GPa, which was much 
higher than the conventional binary coatings.  However, even a 
substrate bias was applied during sputtering, the enhanced value was 
still lower than the expected 40 GPa.  From the quantitative 
analyses and TEM observations, the limited enhancement of 
hardness might be attributed to the blurred grain boundaries and 
oxygen impurities. 
2. The MCNb 3 coating, which exhibited highest hardness, was 
annealed at 600 oC, 700 oC and 800 oC in air atmosphere for 
investigations on the oxidation behavior.  From the X’TEM 
analyses, a mixed amorphous oxide layer formed in the early stage of 
oxidation.  This amorphous protected the inner coating from further 
oxidation so that the smooth surface feature could be maintained.  
After annealing at 700 oC, plate-like TiO2 and spherical CrVO4 were 
identified on the surface.  An apparent Ti outward diffusion was 
also revealed by the quantitative data.  It implied that the coating 
was no longer resistant under this temperature.  On the other hand, 
the as-deposited MCNb coating revealed an improved friction 
coefficient around 0.55 as compared to the Al-containing nitrides.  
However, the self-lubricating phenomenon was not observed at 
  84
CrAlSiN coatings with higher Si content were considered corrosion 
resistant due to reduction of the inter-columnar space.  In contrast, 
coated carbon tool steel demonstrated similar Rct regardless of Si 
content.    Due to the hollowing-out phenomenon in carbon tool 
steels, adhesion of the protective nitride would dominate the Rct 
rather than microstructure.
