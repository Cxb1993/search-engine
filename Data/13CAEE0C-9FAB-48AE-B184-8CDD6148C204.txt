Abstract
The proposed quasi-resonant (QR) zero current switching (ZCS) switched-capacitor (SC)
converter is a new type of bi-directional power flow control conversion scheme. They are able
to provide the voltage conversion ratios from 2 versus 1/2 (double-mode / half-mode) to n
versus 1/n (n-mode / 1/n-mode) by adding a different number of switched-capacitors and
power MOSFET switches with a small series connected resonant inductor for forward and
reverse schemes. The low current stress and balance resonance current are the advantage of
the proposed quasi resonant switched-capacitor converter. The principle of operation,
theoretical analysis of the proposed bi-directional power conversion scheme is described in
detail with circuit model analysis. A state space modeling of the voltage feedback control for
a QR ZCS SC DC to DC converter is presented in this paper. The mathematical model for the
designed controller takes advantage of cybernetics theory to derive the converter transfer
function and frequency responses.
Keywords：Quasi–resonant converter, Zero current switching, Bi-directional converter,

III. CONVERTER ANALYSIS
A. Forward Power Flow Scheme
Figs. 1 show the equivalent circuit of the
proposed non-inverting type 4-mode/1/4-mode
ZCS SC bi-directional converter .The inductor
Lr is small, C1b, C2b and C3b are used to the
resonant tank, the capacitors of C2a, C3a, and C4a
are larger enough to storage energy, Let C1b =
C2b = C3b = Cr and all elements are ideal. The
operation mode analysis of the converter is
described as follow:

connected with C1b, C2b and C3b is charged to

 Abstract-- The proposed quasi-resonant (QR) zero 
current switching (ZCS) switched-capacitor (SC) converter 
is a new type of bi-directional power flow control conversion 
scheme. They are able to provide the voltage conversion 
ratios from 2 versus 1/2 (double-mode / half-mode) to n 
versus 1/n (n-mode / 1/n-mode) by adding a different 
number of switched-capacitors and power MOSFET 
switches with a small series connected resonant inductor for 
forward and reverse schemes. The low current stress and 
balance resonance current are the advantage of the 
proposed quasi resonant switched-capacitor converter. The 
principle of operation, theoretical analysis of the proposed 
bi-directional power conversion scheme is described in 
detail with circuit model analysis. Simulation and 
experimental results are carried out to verify the 
performance of the new type ZCS SC bi-directional QR 
converters. 
 
Index Terms-- Quasi–resonant converter, Zero current 
switching, Switch-capacitor converter, Bi-directional 
converter. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Traditional switching mode DC/DC converter use 
magnetic components and the size of the transformer are 
large in the converter. The switched-capacitor DC/DC 
converters do not requires any inductors and only need 
capacitors and MOSFET switches. However, the 
switching-capacitor DC/DC converters produce larger 
switching loss and high current stress at the high 
switching frequency [1]. Therefore, the quasi-resonant 
switched-capacitor DC/DC converter can operate at 
constant switching frequency with zero-current or zero-
voltage switching (ZCS or ZVS) has been used to reduce 
the switching losses in the converters to overcome the 
above-mentioned disadvantages [2-7]. 
The bi-directional power control scheme have been 
used to the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), battery 
charging and discharging system, and dual voltage 
vehicle power system [6-9]. A switched capacitor based 
bi-directional DC/DC converter providing the capability 
of step-down / step-up voltage is proposed in [8,9]. The 
countermeasures of input/output current pulsating peaks 
of the bi-direction SC converter are suggested but the 
                                                        
This research work was supported by National Science Council of 
Taiwan under grant NSC95-2475-E-030-002-URD and Fu-Jen Catholic 
University 409531040426 
switching losses and the overall converter efficiency are 
not significantly improved. 
This paper presents a new type of switched-capacitor 
step-up/step-down DC/DC quasi-resonant bi-directional 
converter that can be designed to operate at non-inverting 
mode and constant frequency for obtained low switching 
losses. The high switching current stresses can also be

quasi-resonant ZCS switched-capacitor DC/DC converter 
are low weight, small volume, high efficiency, low 
current stress, balance resonance current, and different 
multiple output voltages. Analysis and experimental 
results are used to verify and validate the new concept of 
the proposed bi-directional converters. The operating 
principle of the proposed converter topology is described 
in section II. The converter circuit analysis under the 
forward and reverse power flow control are included in 
section III. Simulation and experimental results are 
discussed in section IV. Section V states the conclusions. 
II.  DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED TOPOLOGY 
Fig. 1 shows the circuit configuration of the proposed 
non-inverting type 4-mode / 1/4-mode (quadruple-mode/ 
quarter-mode) zero current switching switched-capacitor 
bi-directional converter that was developed based on the 
ZCS SC QR converter. Each of the circuits uses 2n 
MOSFET switches (n = 4) and only a very small inductor 
series connected with the switched-capacitors are needed 
to construct the resonant tanks in the converter. A 
resonant inductor Lr is connected in series with a set of 
the switching-capacitors comprising of C1b, C2b and C3b 
to achieve a resonant characteristic when each of the 
switches QNS (contains QN1, QN2, QN3 and QN4) or QPS 
(contains QP1, QP2, QP3 and QP4) are switched on during 
the operating interval. The switches can be designed to 
switch on and off at the zero-current state while the Lr –Cr 
resonant current is rising and falling to zero to achieve 
zero current switching for reducing power losses of the 
MOSFET switches. Switches QN1 or QP1 can control the forward power flow from source V1 to the output source 
V2 as a quadruple-mode converter (i.e. V2 = 4V1) shown 
as Fig.2. Figs. 2(a)-2(d) show the equivalent circuit of the 
proposed ZCS SC QR bi-directional DC/DC converter

 Abstract-- A current mode control （CMC）integrated 
circuit（IC）with accuracy current sensing circuit（CSC） 
for buck converter is presented in this paper. With the 
proposed accurate integrated current sensor, the sensed 
inductor current, combined with the internal ramp signal, 
can be used for current mode DC-DC converter feedback 
control. The proposed CSC does not need an operational 
amplifier to implement, and has been fabricated with a 
standard  0.35μm CMOS process. Simulation results show 
that the switching converter can be operated up to 1MHZ. 
Which is suitable for signal cell lithium-ion battery supply 
applications, the power efficiency is over 85% for supply 
voltage from 2.5V to 5V and the output current is 200 mA. 
The performance of the proposed circuit is the good 
compared to the other circuits.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In today’s consumer electronics market, battery 
powered portable electronic devices are in great demand. 
Portable high frequency and low voltage DC/DC 
converters to efficiently generate low-voltage supplies 
from a single cell battery source to maximize the system 
run time. To decrease the size and weight of these 
devices, minimization of the power module is essential. 
As a result, the trend is to focus on the CMOS converter 
implementations with low power consumption. 
 
It is well-known that the current mode control 
（CMC）DC-DC buck converter has the advantages of 
automatic over-current protection, better stability, better 
line regulation and faster dynamic responses compared 
with the voltage-mode control [1]. It is used for 
overcurrent protection and current-mode feedback 
control. Many different current sensing schemes have 
been developed and implemented to sense the inductor 
current [2-5]. Other current sensing approaches include 
using a series resistor, power MOSFET on-resistance and 
even an integrator [4]. However, these schemes have their 
limitations such as high power dissipation, process 
dependence, control difficulty and high implementation 
complexity. Therefore, an accurate current sensing circuit
（CSC）  is necessary for all CMC switching mode 
power supplies (SMPS). 
 
Fig. 1 illustrates a simplified buck converter structure 
with CMC integrated circuit (IC). This converter is 
composed of a power stage and a feedback network. The 
current sensing circuit function block provides an 
accurate integrated current sensor. This function block 
can be used for current mode DC-DC converter feedback 
control. The power stage is the synchronous rectifier buck 
converter contains a switching element, consisting of a 
power PMOSFET, NMOSFET transistors and an output 
filter, that is constructed using an inductor L1 and a 
filtering capacitor C with equivalent series resistor (ESR). 
The output voltage is scaled down to βVo to compare 
with the reference voltage Vref before feeding into the 
compensator. The compensator, compensation ramp and 
sensed inductor current signal output will pass through 
the modulator and digital control block to define the duty 
ratio d(t). The duty ratio d(t) controls the on-time and off-
time duration of the power MOSFET switches. The 
negative feedback is achieved to control the duty ratio 
perturbation to regulate the buck converter output voltage 
Vo. A soft start circuit is designed to control the transient 
inrush current of the inductor in CMC buck converter.

 resistor RSEN is connected to the source follower M3 
and to the supply voltage VDD. The source of the 
power device is also connected to VDD. The drain of 
the power device MP1 and the drain of the source 
follower M3 are connected to the drain of the 
synchronous device MN1, which is connected to the 
buck converter external inductor L1. In a preferred 
embodiment, 1MHZ switching frequency is used. 
 
 
Fig. 3a The proposed integrated current sensing 
circuit 
 
The complete schematic is shows in Fig. 3b, the 
voltage drop across the sense-resistor RSEN is mirrored 
with a second pair of PMOSFET source followers M4 
and M5, from one side of M4 and M5 pair to the other 
side. The common gate stage is comprised of PMOS 
transistors M4 and M5 and resistors R1 and R2. 
Transistors M4 and M5 have equal conductive 
width/length so that they conduct equal currents with 
equal voltage bias. The current mirror stage is comprised 
of NMOS transistors M8, M9, M10 and   M11. The 
current mirror stage mirrors the current of NMOS 
transistors M11 to NMOS M10. The NMOS transistors 
M8 and M9 are cascade devices that provide high output 
impedance to the drain of PMOS transistor M8. However, 
cascade device will limit the Vout maximum value and 
waste one PMOS threshold voltage in the swing, so that 
the M8 and M9 are biased at the edge of the triode region 
[6]. 
 
In the current mode control buck converter 
application, the current sensing voltage ISEN is useful in 
the control feedback loop only during the on-state. Thus, 
only the signal from the power transistor MP1 and mirror 
transistor M3 during turn-on is useful, as a result, there 
will be a small current flowing through the sensing 
resistor RSEN. The voltage to current output stage 
provides current feedback to maintain a condition where 
nodes VA and VB are at an equal voltage. When a 
current IS flows in RSEN, in the direction of the arrow, it 
unbalances the current mirror produced by the two 
MOSFETs M4 and M5, this unbalance causes the third 
MOSFET M7 to be forward biased that a current Ifb flows 
in this transistor. The current Ifb increases the voltage 
drop across the resistor R4 until the sources of the two 
transistors M4 and M5 are returned to the same voltage. 
As VA equals to VB, it follows: 
 
4fb S SEN SENI R I R V× = × =       （1） 
 
This corresponds to the voltage across resistor R1 
being equal to the combined voltage of the differential 
voltage VSEN and the voltage across resistor R2. The 
current of PMOS transistors M4 and M5 is approximately 
I1 in this stable condition. A feedback current Ifb  and the 
I1 current of the PMOS transistor M5 combine to generate 
a voltage drop across resistor R1 to bring the current 
sensing circuit into balance. Hence, the current IM7 
flowing through the internal resistor R4 is proportional to 
and substantially smaller than the current Io flowing 
through the load. 
 
 
Fig. 3b The complete schematic integrated current 
sensing circuit 
 
To provide a low-cost, low-power and fully 
integrated CMOS power module for portable applications, 
a current-mode DC/DC buck converter with a novel 
current sensor for feedback control was fabricated using 
the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
（ TSMC ） 0.35 μ m polycide CMOS process. This 
converter was implemented using a synchronous rectifier 
that the forward-bias diode voltage drop is eliminated and 
the overall efficiency is enhanced. All power MOSFETs, 
feedback control circuits, and current-sensing circuits are 
fabricated on-chip. Only one off-chip inductor and one 
off-chip capacitor are needed at the power stage, and no 
off-chip inductor current-sensing is needed. This reduces 
the number of I/O pins and the number of reactive 
components needed for the converter. Moreover, it can be 
designed for an input voltage from 2.5V to 5V with the 
load current below 200 mA, which is suitable for portable 
electronic devices powered using a single-cell lithium-ion 
battery [7, 8].
