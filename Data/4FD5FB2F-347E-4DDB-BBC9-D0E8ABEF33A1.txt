contributions on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Wireless Communications, 
basically consisting of 1) physical-layer secrecy and 2) robust transmit beamforming, 
including creative ideas, theoretical analysis and proofs, and simulations. For the first

artificial-noise-aided beamforming scheme, which can significantly enhance the 
information secrecy of wireless systems. For the second research topic, using convex 
optimization theory, we have developed some efficient robust transmit beamforming 
schemes for both single-cell wireless systems and multi-cell coordinated wireless 
systems. Some of these research results were finished through close collaboration

receivers either by uplink training in time division duplex (TDD) systems or through 
receivers’ feedback in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. However, due to 
finite-length training signal (which leads to channel estimation errors) or limited 
feedback bandwidth (which results in quantization errors), it is inevitable that errors 
exist in the CSI at the transmitter. In these practical scenarios, the conventional 
transmitter designs such as beamforming may no longer guarantee the desired 
receiver performance, and consequently performance outage may occur. To alleviate 
such CSI-error-induced performance loss, transmit beamforming designs that take 
into consideration the CSI errors, also known as robust transmit beamforming, have 
been a cutting edge research subject drawing great interest in recent years. Depending 
on the CSI error model, there are two major classes of robust transmit beamforming 
designs, the worst-case robust design and the stochastic robust design. In the 
worst-case robust design, CSI errors are assumed to be within a predetermined 
bounded error set, and the beamforming vectors are designed such that QoS 
requirements are attained for all channels satisfying this bounded error model. In the 
stochastic robust design, the CSI errors are assumed to be random, following certain 
statistical distribution, and the beamforming vectors are designed such that all the 
receivers can attain the QoS requirements with a high probability (i.e., a low 
performance outage probability). Unfortunately, either for the worst-case robust 
design or for the stochastic robust design, the associated optimization problem is 
nonconvex and difficult to solve. This motivates us to develop advanced 
approximation algorithms using convex optimization theory for the robust 
beamforming design.

an open wireless medium. This paper proposes a secret transmit beamforming 
approach using a quality-of-service (QoS)-based perspective. Specifically, we 
establish design formulations that i) constrain the maximum allowable 
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) of the eavesdroppers, and that ii) 
provide the intended receiver with a satisfactory SINR through either a guaranteed 
SINR constraint or SINR maximization. The proposed designs incorporate a relatively 
new idea called artificial noise (AN), where a suitable amount of AN is added in the 
transmitted signal to confuse the eavesdroppers. Our designs advocate joint 
optimization of the transmit weights and AN spatial distribution in accordance with 
the channel state information (CSI) of the intended receiver and eavesdroppers. Our 
formulated design problems are shown to be NP-hard in general. We deal with this 
difficulty by using semidefinite relaxation (SDR), an approximation technique based 
on convex optimization. Interestingly, we prove that SDR can exactly solve the design 
problems for a practically representative class of problem instances; e.g., when the 
intended receiver’s instantaneous CSI is known. Extensions to the 
colluding-eavesdropper scenario and the multi-intended-receiver scenario are also 
examined. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed AN-aided designs 
can yield significant power savings or SINR enhancement compared to some other 
methods.

secrecy with artificial noise -— The noise leakage problem,” submitted to IEEE 
Trans. Wireless Communications, March, 2010 (full paper, revised Sept. 2010 
and currently under 2nd round review). 
 
Abstract: The impact of quantized channel direction information (CDI) on the 
achievable secrecy rate is studied for multiple antenna wiretap channels. By assuming 
that the eavesdropper’s channel is unknown at the transmitter, we adopt the 
transmission scheme where artificial noise (AN) is imposed in the null space of the 
legitimate receiver’s channel to disrupt the eavesdropper’s reception. It has been 
shown that, in the ideal case where perfect CDI is available at the transmitter, the 
achievable secrecy rate can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the transmission 
power. However, when only quantized CDI is available, the AN that was originally 
intended to jam the eavesdropper may now leak into the legitimate receiver’s channel, 
causing significant secrecy rate loss. For a given number of feedback bits B and 
transmission power P, we derive the optimal power allocation among the 
message-bearing signal and the AN to maximize the secrecy rate under AN leakage.

Abstract: This paper considers a multiuser transmit beamforming design in the 
presence of Gaussian distributed channel errors at the transmitter. We study a 
stochastic robust design problem that minimizes the transmission power subject to 
probabilistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints on the 
receivers. While the probabilistically constrained design problem is difficult to solve, 
we present a conservative approximation formulation that guarantees the satisfaction 
of the probabilistic SINR requirements. The proposed conservative formulation is 
reminiscent of the worst-case robust design problem with spherically bounded 
channel errors, and can be efficiently handled by semidefinite relaxation. The 
presented simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing 
methods and requires less transmission powers under the same SINR requirement.

Abstract: Multicell coordinated beamforming (MCBF) has been recognized as a 
promising approach to enhancing the system throughput and spectrum efficiency of 
wireless cellular systems. In contrast to the conventional single-cell beamforming 
(SBF) design, MCBF jointly optimizes the beamforming vectors of cooperative base 
stations (BSs) (via a central processing unit (CPU)) in order to mitigate the intercell 
interference. While most of the existing designs assume that the CPU has the perfect 
knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) of mobile stations (MSs), this paper 
takes into account the inevitable CSI errors at the CPU, and study the robust MCBF 
design problem. Specifically, we consider the worst-case robust design formulation 
that minimizes the weighted sum transmission power of BSs subject to worst-case 
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints on MSs. The associated 
optimization problem is challenging because it involves infinitely many nonconvex 
SINR constraints. In this paper, we show that the worst-case SINR constraints can be 
reformulated as linear matrix inequalities, and the approximation method known as

Training Sequence Design for Discriminatory
Channel Estimation in Wireless MIMO Systems
Tsung-Hui Chang∗, Wei-Cheng Chiang†, Y.-W. Peter Hong‡, and Chong-Yung Chi††
Abstract—This paper proposes a training-based channel
estimation scheme for achieving quality-of-service discrimination
between legitimate and unauthorized receivers in wireless
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. The proposed
method has applications ranging from user discrimination in
wireless TV broadcast systems to the prevention of eavesdropping
in secret communications. By considering a wireless MIMO
system that consists of a multiple-antenna transmitter, a
legitimate receiver (LR) and an unauthorized receiver (UR),
we propose a multi-stage training-based discriminatory channel
estimation (DCE) scheme that aims to optimize the channel
estimation performance of the LR while limiting the channel
estimation performance of the UR. The key idea is to exploit
the channel estimate fed back from the LR at the beginning of
each stage to enable the judicious use of artificial noise (AN)
in the training signal. Specifically, with knowledge of the LR’s
channel, AN can be properly superimposed with the training
data to degrade the UR’s channel without causing strong
interference on the LR. The channel estimation performance
of the LR in earlier stages may not be satisfactory due to the
inaccuracy of the channel estimate and constraints on the UR’s
estimation performance, but can improve rapidly in later stages
as the quality of channel estimate improves. The training data
power and AN power are optimally allocated by minimizing the
normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of the LR subject to a
lower limit constraint on the NMSE of the UR. The proposed
DCE scheme is then extended to the case with multiple LRs and
multiple URs. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DCE scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
The need for discrimination between the quality-of-service
(QoS) of different receivers in wireless systems appear in
many applications, such as the QoS discrimination between
paid and unpaid subscribers in TV broadcast systems, and
the prevention of eavesdropping by unauthorized receivers
(i.e., eavesdroppers) in secret communications. Convention-
ally, these issues have been addressed through the use of
application-level techniques such as user authentication [1]
or cryptography [2]. However, these methods may be sub-
ject to vulnerabilities and difficulties in key distribution and
management, especially in highly dynamic wireless networks
[3], [4]. Recent developments in physical-layer secrecy [5]–
[9] have shown that this information security problem can
also be handled in the physical layer by directly exploiting
the different fading characteristics between the legitimate
and unauthorized receivers’ channels. It has been shown that
the transmitter can reliably broadcast message signals to the
legitimate receiver without having the unauthorized receiver
infer any information from the message if QoS discrimina-
tion between the legitimate and the unauthorized receivers
is guaranteed. These physical-layer techniques, therefore, can
provide information security without involving any complex
key exchange and management. Besides, they can be used
as a complement to higher-layer security techniques. For
example, one can use these physical-layer secrecy techniques
to strengthen the security of the key exchanging process. Most
of the existing works on physical-layer secrecy focus on the
study of the maximum achievable perfect secrecy rate, i.e., the
so called perfect secrecy capacity [5]–[9], from an information
theoretic point of view, or on the design of channel coding
or beamforming strategies [10]–[15] under the assumption
that both the legitimate and unauthorized receivers perfectly
know their channel state information (CSI). We instead inves-
tigate the problem of QoS discrimination from the channel
estimation perspective through the design of training signals
for discriminating between channel estimation performances
at receivers. The proposed training and channel estimation
schemes, therefore, identify a completely new problem that
has not been addressed in the literature.
In this paper, we consider a wireless multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system that consists of a multiple-
antenna transmitter and two (multiple-antenna) receivers,
namely, the legitimate receiver (LR) and the unauthorized
receiver (UR). The UR is assumed to be passive and it
would not emit signals to prevent communication between

to intercept the fedback channel estimate1). The fedback
channel estimate enables the transmitter to use artificial
noise (AN) to degrade the channel estimation perfor-
mance of the UR. Specifically, the transmitter broadcasts
another sequence of training signals which superimposes
training data with AN that is placed in the left null space
of the LR’s channel estimate. Both the LR and the UR
will make use of the training signals in both stages to
refine their channel estimates, but the performance of
the UR will be constrained due to AN. The feedback-
and-retraining process can be repeated multiple times, if
necessary.
Assume that the feedback-and-retraining process is per-
formed K times such that there is a total of K + 1 stages in
the training process, and that the channels from the transmitter
to the LR and to the UR remain static over the entire training
process2. Let Xk ∈ CTk×Nt denote the transmitted training
signal matrix in stage k, with the signal length equal to Tk.
The signals received by the LR and the UR are respectively
given by
LR : Yk = XkH+Wk, (1)
UR : Zk = XkG+Vk, (2)
for k = 0, 1, . . . ,K , where the parameters are defined as
follows:
H ∈ CNt×NL : The MIMO channel matrix of the LR. The
elements of H are assumed to be indepen-
dent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) ran-
dom variables with zero mean and variance
equal to σ2H .
G ∈ CNt×NU : The MIMO channel matrix of the UR. The
elements of G are assumed to be i.i.d. ran-
dom variables with zero mean and variance
equal to σ2G.
Wk ∈ C
Tk×NL : Additive (spatially and temporally) white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) matrix at the LR,
with the power of each entry equal to σ2w.
Vk ∈ C
Tk×NU : AWGN matrix at the UR, with the power of
each entry equal to σ2v .
Let Pk be the training data power at stage k, for k =
0, . . . ,K . The training signal matrices Xk, k = 0, . . . ,K ,
are designed as follows. In the initial stage (i.e., k = 0), the
transmitter broadcasts a pure training signal

C0 (3)
for preliminary channel estimation at the LR, where C0 ∈
CT0×Nt is the training data matrix satisfying Tr(CH0 C0) = Nt
in which Tr(·) represents the trace of a matrix. The LR uses
the received signal Y0 and the training signal X0 to obtain
1As will be seen in Section III-A, the UR can perform the optimal LMMSE
channel estimation without using the intercepted channel estimate. Moreover,
if the transmitter employs the so called secrecy channel coding [6], [8] in the
data transmission phase, this intercepted channel estimate is useless and does
not enable the UR to intercept the information message sent by the transmitter.

be investigated by computer simulations in Section VI.
a preliminary estimate of H, denoted by Hˆ0, and sends Hˆ0
back to the transmitter.
With knowledge of Hˆ0 at the transmitter, we can then design
the training signals that contain AN in the left null space of
Hˆ0 [11] in an attempt to corrupt the UR’s channel estimate.
Specifically, by assuming that Nt > NL, the training signal
in stage 1 is given by
X1 =
√

Nt
C1 +A1 ·N
H
Hˆ0
, (4)
where C1 ∈ CT1×Nt represents the training data matrix
satisfying Tr(CH1 C1) = Nt, NHˆ0 ∈ C
Nt×(Nt−NL) is a
matrix that spans the left null space of Hˆ0 and satisfies
N
H
Hˆ0
N
Hˆ0
= INt−NL (the (Nt − NL) by (Nt − NL) identity
matrix) and NH
Hˆ0
Hˆ0 = 0, and A1 ∈ CT1×(Nt−NL) is an
AN matrix with each entry being i.i.d. zero-mean, complex
Gaussian random variables with variance equal to σ2a,1. It is
worthwhile to notice that the LR may also suffer from the AN
added in (4) since the estimate Hˆ0 is in general not perfect
[19]. Therefore, the allocation between the training data power
P1 and the AN power σ2a,1 should be designed carefully.
The training design rule used in (4) also applies to Xk for
k = 2, . . . ,K if multiple feedback-and-retraining stages are
performed. This will be discussed in detail in Section IV. In
the next section, we focus on the case of K = 1 (one feedback-
and-retraining stage) and present a design criterion for the
discrimination between the estimation performance of the LR
and that of the UR.
III. DISCRIMINATORY CHANNEL ESTIMATION FOR K = 1
In this section, we first analyze the channel estimation
performances of the LR and the UR, considering that the
training signal design proposed in the previous section is used
with K = 1. For simplicity of formulation, we assume that
orthogonal training data are used, that is, CH0 C0 = INt and
C
H
1 C1 = INt . Then, we find the optimal set of training data
powers P0, P1, and the AN power σ2a,1 that minimizes the
NMSE of the LR subject to a lower limit constraint on the
NMSE of the UR.
A. NMSE Analysis and Design Criterion
Let us assume that both the LR and the UR employ the
LMMSE criterion3 [23] for channel estimation. In that case,
the preliminary channel estimate of H at the LR in the initial
stage (i.e., stage 0) is given by

where ∆H0 ∈ CNt×NL denotes the estimation error matrix.
One can show that ∆H0 has the correlation matrix given by

unbiased estimation (BLUE) are referred to [22].

whenever P1T1 > 0. This implies that, compared to using Z0
only, the UR can obtain better channel estimation performance
by using both Z0 and Z1, even though Z1 is poisoned by AN.
With (16) and (21), we propose to find the optimal set of
training data powers P0, P1 and AN power σ2a,1 by solving
the following optimization problem:

≤ Pave, (24c)
where γ > 0 is the preassigned lower limit on the UR’s
achievable NMSE, and Pave > 0 is the maximum average
transmission power. By (3) and (4), the constraint in (24c)
becomes

which represents an average power constraint on the training
signals over both stages. We can see that the design criterion
in (24) aims to minimize the NMSE of the LR while enforcing
the NMSE of the UR to be no less than γ.
It is interesting to remark that, when
γ <

, (26)
where the right-hand side is the minimum NMSE achievable
at the UR without any interference from the AN, problem (24)
yields the trivial solution where σ2a,1 = 0 and P0, P1 (≥ 0)
are any values that satisfy P0T0+P1T1 = Pave(T0+T1). This
implies that no AN is needed and thus there is no performance
discrimination between receivers. Moreover, by (22), (23) and
(24b) it must hold that
γ ≤ NMSE

U =

(27)
where (a) follows from the fact that P0T0 ≥ 0. Hence, in the
following we shall consider only the interesting case of(

B. Optimal Power Allocation
To illustrate how problem (24) can be solved, let us define
a = P0T0, b = P1T1, c = (Nt −NL)σ

a,1 and
γ˜ , (

2
v ≥ 0. (29)
In this case, the condition in (28) reduces to
0 ≤ γ˜ ≤ Pave(T0 + T1). (30)
Then we can reformulate problem (24) into the following
maximization problem

a+ T1 · c+ b ≤ Pave(T0 + T1), (31c)
By close inspection of the problem structure of (31), we show
in the following proposition that the three-dimensional opti-
mization problem can be solved by a simple one-dimensional
line search. The proof is given in Appendix A.
Proposition 1 Let {a⋆, b⋆, c⋆} be the optimum solution to
the nonconvex optimization problem in (31) with 0 ≤ γ˜ ≤
Pave(T0 + T1). For
η , Nt(
σ2v

the optimal solution to problem (31) is given by c⋆ = 0 (i.e.,
no AN is needed) and any a⋆, b⋆ ≥ 0 such that a⋆ + b⋆ = γ˜
(e.g., a⋆ = b⋆ = γ˜/2). On the other hand, for η ≤ γ˜, the
optimum value of a (i.e., a⋆) can be obtained by solving the
following one-variable optimization problem

where

b(a) = σ2G
(
γ˜ − a

)
c(a) + γ˜ − a. (35)
The associated values of b⋆ and c⋆ are given by b(a⋆) and
c(a⋆), respectively.
Proposition 1 implies that a globally optimal solution of
problem (31) and, thus, problem (24) can be conveniently
obtained via a simple line search with respect to a over
the interval [max{η, 0}, γ˜], provided that η ≤ γ˜; otherwise
a simple closed-form solution can be readily obtained with
c⋆ = 0 and, e.g., a⋆ = b⋆ = γ˜/2. To gain more insights
from Proposition 1, one may interpret η in (32) as a measure
of channel quality difference between the UR and the LR.
When η > γ˜, it implies that the UR is under a much worse
channel condition (either with a larger noise power or a smaller
channel variance) than the LR, so there is no need to use
AN to interfere with the UR. However, when η ≤ γ˜ or even
η ≤ 0, which implies that the UR has a comparable or even
better channel condition than the LR, additional AN has to
be transmitted in order to limit the UR’s channel estimation
performance.

in (42b). To solve this, one can simultaneously scale down
{P ⋆0 , P

k } such that (42b) holds with equality to obtain
an initial set of feasible power values for problem (42). By our
experience in simulations, this simple initialization approach
works well for the condensation method in Table I.
V. DISCRIMINATORY CHANNEL ESTIMATION WITH
MULTIPLE LRS AND URS
In the previous sections, we have focused on the scenario
where there is only one LR and one UR. In this section, we
extend the proposed DCE scheme to the case with multiple
LRs and multiple URs.
Assume that there are ML LRs, each equipped with NL
antennas, and MU URs, each equipped with NU antennas,
and that Nt > MLNL. Let Hi ∈ CNt×NL denote the MIMO
channel matrix between the transmitter and the ith LR, and let
Gj ∈ C
Nt×NU denote the MIMO channel matrix between the
transmitter and the jth UR. The elements of Hi and Gj are
i.i.d. random variables with zero mean and variances equal to
σ2H,i and σ2G,j , respectively. The received signals at LR i and
UR j are respectively given by
LR i : Yi,k = XkHi +Wi,k, i = 1, . . . ,ML, (46)
UR j : Zj,k = XkGj +Vj,k, j = 1, . . . ,MU , (47)
for k = 0, . . . ,K , where Wi,k ∈ CTk×NU and Vj,k ∈
CTk×NU are the AWGN with the power of each entry equal to
σ2w,i and σ2v,j , respectively. Let Hˆi,k ∈ CNt×NL be the channel
estimate of the ith LR obtained at stage k, and assume that all
the LRs send back their channel estimates to the transmitter.
Then similar to (3) and (36), the training signals are given by
X0 =
√
P0T0
Nt
C0, (48)
Xk =
√
PkTk
Nt
Ck +AkN
H
Hˆk−1
, (49)
where N
Hˆk−1
∈ CNt×(Nt−MLNL) is a matrix that spans the
left null space of the channel estimate
Hˆk−1 = [Hˆ1,k−1, Hˆ2,k−1, ..., HˆML,k−1] ∈ C
Nt×MLNL . (50)
Since the training signals are broadcast to all the receivers,
both LRs and URs can use the same training signals
X0, . . . ,XK to perform channel estimation. Hence, the NMSE
of the LRs and that of the URs have the same structures
as those in (40) and (41), respectively. The training design
formulated in (24) and (42) can then be extended to the case
with multiple LRs and multiple URs by minimizing the worst
NMSE performance among LRs subject to NMSE constraints
on all the URs. The design formulation is given as follows

Here, NMSE(i,K)L and NMSE

U denote the NMSEs of the
ith LR and the jth UR at stage K , respectively. Problem
(51) can be efficiently approximated by the monomial ap-
proximation and condensation method in a way similar to that
presented in Section IV and Appendix B.
The design problem in (51) can be simplified for the
special case where σ2H,1 = σ2H,2 = · · · = σ2H,ML and
σ2G,1 = σ

G,2 = · · · = σ

. In particular, by (40) and (41)
one can see that the LR with the largest σ2w,i would have the
largest NMSE(i,K)L , and the UR with the smallest σ2v,j would
have the smallest NMSE(i,K)U . In this case, one needs only to
consider the performances of these two users in the training
signal design. For example, if σ2w,1 ≤ σ2w,2 ≤ · · · ≤ σ2w,ML
and σ2v,1 ≤ σ2v,2 ≤ · · · ≤ σ2v,MU , then the design problem in(51) can be reduced to

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, simulation results are presented to demon-
strate the efficacy of the proposed training signal design and
DCE scheme. We first consider the wireless system shown
in Fig. 1 with one LR and one UR. We assumed that the
transmitter has four antennas (Nt = 4), and both the LR
and the UR have two antennas (NL = NU = 2). The
elements of the channel matrices H and G were i.i.d. complex
Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit variance
(σ2H = σ2G = 1). The training data matrices Ck, k = 0, . . . ,K ,
were randomly drawn from semi-unitary Tk×Nt matrices. The
average power Pave was set to 30 dBm (Pave = 1) and the
training signal length per stage was set to
T0 = T0 = · · · = TK =
⌊
300
K + 1
⌋
. (53)
Note from (53) that we have partitioned the training sequence
into (K+1) equal-length segments, and fixed the total training
length (which was 300)4 for any choice of K . Except for the
4th simulation example below, we assumed that the channel
matrices H and G were static during the whole training
process. In the simulation, we consider an “NMSE lower
bound”
NMSE lower bound =

, (54)
which represents the best NMSE performance achievable at
the LR without using any AN (i.e., σ2a,k = 0 for all k). Note
that this bound also corresponds to the NMSE performance
achieved by the conventional (non-discriminatory) MIMO
4In IEEE 802.11a wireless LAN systems [26], the training sequence length
for channel acquisition is around 284 samples.

with K (i.e. the number of feedback-and-retraining stages) for
SNRL = 20 dB. As can be seen from this figure, a significant
NMSE performance discrimination can be achieved with K =
3, showing that the proposed DCE scheme actually works well
even with a small number of K .
To illustrate how multiple stages of feedback and retraining
can improve the DCE performance, we plot the optimized
power values of {Pk}Kk=0 and {σ2a,k}Kk=1 in Fig. 2(d) for
γ = 0.03 and SNRL = SNRU = 25 dB. We can see that
the optimized P0 is relatively small in order to limit the UR’s
best NMSE performance to 0.03. After that, the optimized
Pk as well as AN powers σ2a,k monotonically increases since
the NMSE(k)L gradually decreases from one training stage to
another [see (40)].
Example 2: In this example, we examine the detection
performances of receivers using the channel estimates obtained
with the proposed DCE scheme. We considered the scenario
where the transmitter sends to the LR a 4-by-4 complex
orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) which has Nt = 4
and T = 4 (the code length), and contains three QAM source
symbols per code block [27]. Both the LR and the UR will
use their channel estimates obtained with DCE to decode
the unknown symbols5. The simulation was conducted with
NL = NU = 2 and SNRL = SNRU. The average symbol
error rates (SERs) of the LR and the UR were obtained
by averaging over 50,000 channel realizations and OSTBCs.
Figure 3(a) presents the associated average SERs for 64-QAM
OSTBC and γ = 0.1. Note that we only plot the SER curve
of the UR for K = 1 since the UR has almost the same
average symbol error performances for all the values of K .
One can see from this figure that, with increased K , the SERs
of the LR gradually improves while that of the UR remains
around 0.5. We should mention that the transmission rates in
the simulation are kept the same for all K since the total
training length has been fixed to 300 [see (53)]. In Fig. 3(b),
the associated SERs for 64-QAM OSTBC and γ = 0.03 are
presented. In comparison with Fig. 3(a), one can see that the
performance discrimination becomes much more evident for
γ = 0.03, even with one feedback-and-retraining stage only
(K = 1). For K ≥ 3, we see from this figure that the LR
can achieve SER performance close to that with perfect CSI;
whereas the UR’s SER is still limited to around 0.1. In Fig.
3(c), we further display the SERs for 256-QAM OSTBC and
γ = 0.03. Similar performance trends can be observed. It is
worthwhile to note that the SER results in Fig. 3 are consistent
with the channel estimation performance in Fig. 2(c).
Example 3: In this example, we consider a wireless system
with 2 LRs (say LR 1 and LR 2) and 3 URs (say UR 1, UR
2, and UR 3) (see Section V). We set Nt = 6 and NL =
NU = 2, and let all the channels of LRs and URs have unit
variance (i.e., σ2H,1 = σ2H,2 = 1 and σ2G,1 = σ2G,2 = σ2G,3 =
1). The SNRs of LR 1 and LR 2 are set to 30 dB and 20
dB, respectively. The SNRs of UR 1, UR 2 and UR 3 were
set to 40 dB, 30 dB and 20 dB. According to (52), we only
5It is worthwhile to note that square OSTBCs (i.e., with Nt = T ) in general
cannot be properly decoded without CSI at the receiver. See [28] and [16]
for the details. Therefore, the UR has to use its channel estimate for symbol
decoding.

research directions in information theory. For example, one
may consider analyzing the achievable perfect secrecy rate
under imperfect CSI at the LR and the UR. This is in sharp
contrast to most existing works where both receivers are
assumed to have perfect CSI [6]–[9]. It is anticipated that a
higher perfect secrecy rate can be achieved if the UR does not
have an accurate channel estimate.
APPENDIX A
PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1
Here we prove Proposition 1. We see from (31b) that a
feasible a must satisfy a ≤ γ˜. Suppose that a feasible a ≤ γ˜ is
given to problem (31). We can first find the optimal values of b
and c as a function of a by solving the following optimization
problem

T1c+ b ≤ Pave(T0 + T1)− a. (A.1c)
Let {b⋆(a), c⋆(a)} be the optimal solution of problem (A.1).
One can inspect that constraint (A.1b) must be active when
the optimal objective value is achieved; otherwise, one can
always obtain a larger objective value by decreasing c⋆(a).
If constraint (A.1b) is not active even when c⋆(a) = 0, then
one can instead increase b⋆(a) to obtain a larger objective
value. Since we only consider the interesting case where γ˜ ≤
Pave(T0+T1) [see (30)], constraint (A.1b) must be active with
b⋆(a) = γ˜ − a if c⋆(a) = 0. Hence, we have that
b⋆(a) = (
σ2G
σ2v
c⋆(a) + 1)(γ˜ − a). (A.2)
By substituting (A.2) into (A.1), problem (A.1a) reduces to

One can show that the objective function in (A.3a) is mono-
tonically decreasing with respect to c for
a < η , Nt(

In this case, the optimum value of c⋆(a) is equal to 0, and the
associated objective value is given by γ˜.
On the other hand, if a ≥ η the objective function in (A.3a)
is monotonically non-decreasing with respect to c, and thus
the optimum value of c⋆(a) of problem (A.3) will activate the
constraint in (A.3b) leading to

As seen, a posynomials is simply non-negative weighted sum
of monomials. Comparing problem (A.11) with the standard
GP in (A.12), one can see that the objective function and all
the inequality constraints of problem (A.11) are posynomials,
except for the constraints in (A.11b). In fact, the inequality
constraints in (A.11b) can only be expressed as ratios of
posynomials as

To resolve these hard constraints and to obtain an effective

[24]. The idea of the monomial approximation technique is
to locally approximate the posynomial in the denominator of
the left-hand side of (A.15) by a monomial function, and
the condensation method is to find an approximate solution
of problem (A.11) by successively solving the monomial-
approximated problem. Specifically, given a feasible point
{a¯0, a¯k, b¯k, t¯0, t¯k, k = 1, . . . ,K} of problem (A.11), one can

{a¯0, a¯k, b¯k, t¯0, t¯k, k = 1, . . . ,K}, problem (A.11) is locally
approximated by the problem (A.20) at the top of the next
page. Since (A.20) now is a standard GP [see (A.12)], it can
be efficiently solved by general purpose interior point solvers
such as CVX [25] in a polynomial-time complexity. Then the
condensation method [24] finds an approximate solution of
problem (A.11) by iteratively solving a sequence of problems
(A.20) with each initial feasible point {a¯0, a¯k, b¯k, t¯0, t¯k, k =
1, . . . ,K} given by the optimum solution of (A.20) in the
previous iteration. In Table I, we summarize the condensation
method for problem (42).

2I. INTRODUCTION
Transmit beamforming designs through quality-of-service (QoS) optimizations have recently flourished
as an important class of multi-antenna transmission techniques. QoS-based transmit beamforming has
proven to be a viable, versatile approach to a variety of communication scenarios, such as downlink
unicast [2]–[5], downlink multicast [6], and multi-group multicast (a combination of unicast and multi-
cast) [7]. In this topic, the challenges usually lie in the optimization of a desired, possibly nonconvex,
design formulation; and convex optimization has been playing a significant role in this aspect, providing
tractable solutions that can either exactly solve or well approximate the considered design formulation. For
a general coverage of convex optimization for transmit beamforming, readers are referred to the magazine
article [8] and the book chapter [9]; see also [10]–[13] for some further studies on the capability of convex
optimization, and [14], [15] for some emerging applications.
This paper explores a relatively new problem in QoS-based transmit beamforming — secure transmis-
sion in the presence of eavesdroppers. To illustrate the problem, consider a commercial wireless downlink
scenario, where some participating users of the system attempt to access service requiring additional
charges (e.g., high-definition video) by overhearing. While overhearing cannot be stopped in an open
wireless medium, a basestation equipped with multiple transmit antennas may perform a countermeasure
by transmit beamforming. The premise of this is the eavesdroppers’ channel state information (CSI), which
would be available for active eavesdroppers or participating system users. With transmit beamforming,
one can utilize the spatial degree of freedom (DoF) to cripple eavesdroppers’ interceptions.
In fact, we should point out that information secrecy using physical-layer transmit designs, commonly
known as physical-layer secrecy in the present literature, has caught growing attention recently. The
motivation behind is that under open wireless media, information security using crytographic encryption
(in the network layer) may be subject to vulnerabilities, such as problems with secret key distribution
and management. Physical-layer secrecy may serve as an alternative to, or a complement to, crytographic
encryption. In a classical physical-layer secrecy setting where there is one legitimate receiver single-input-
single-output (SISO) channel and one eavesdropper SISO channel (i.e., the so-called Gaussian wiretap
channel), it was already shown back in the 70’s [16], [17] that the transmitter can send a message reliably
to the legitimate receiver, at a positive rate and with the eavesdropper being unable to extract almost any
information, if the eavesdropper’s channel is a degraded version of the legitimate receiver’s. The recent
interest in physical-layer secrecy may be seen as a renewed one, but it is also a timely one: with multi-
input-multi-output (MIMO) systems, one may exploit the available spatial DoF to degrade eavesdroppers’

4consider semidefinite relaxation (SDR), a convex-optimization-based approximation technique that has
been proven to be a powerful tool for handling a wide variety of signal processing problems [8], [31],
[32]. Our analysis reveals that SDR can lead to exact (or globally optimal) solutions to the proposed
design problems for some instances; e.g., when the legitimate receiver’s CSI is known, or when the spatial
covariances of the legitimate receiver’s and eavesdroppers’ CSIs are white. Moreover, two extensions,
namely, those for colluding eavesdroppers and multiple legitimate receivers, are examined.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II provides the problem formulation. The optimization
aspects of the formulated designs are addressed in Sections III and IV, respectively. Section V describes
extensions of the present work to more complex scenarios. Simulation results and conclusions are given
in Sections VI and VII, respectively.
The notation of this paper is as follows. Boldface lowercase and uppercase letters, such as a and
A, are used to represent vectors and matrices respectively. The symbol In denotes the n-by-n identity
matrix, 0 a zero vector or matrix, and ei a unit vector where the ith entry is one and the other entries
zero. The superscripts T and H stand for the transpose and conjugate transpose respectively. The set of
all n-dimensional complex vectors is denoted by Cn. The set of all complex Hermitian n-by-n matrices
is denoted by Hn. Range{·} denotes the range space of the argument. The Euclidean norm is denoted
by ‖ · ‖. The trace operator is denoted by Tr(·). When we write A  B, it means that A−B is positive
semidefinite (PSD). Similarly, A ≻ B means that A−B is positive definite. The PSD square root factor
of a Hermitian PSD matrix A is denoted by A1/2. The symbol E{·} represents the statistical expectation
of the argument. The notation x ∼ CN (µ,Σ) means that x is a random vector following a complex
circular Gaussian distribution with mean µ and covariance Σ.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, we describe the system model and formulate the proposed secret transmit beamforming
designs.
A. Signal Model
Our scenario of interest is that of one single-antenna legitimate receiver overheard by multiple single-
antenna eavesdroppers. A simple diagram is depicted in Fig. 1 to illustrate the scenario. For convenience,
we will refer to the transmitter, the legitimate receiver, and the eavesdroppers as Alice, Bob, and Eves,
respectively. Alice is equipped with Nt transmit antennas, using transmit beamforming to send information
to a single-antenna Bob; the transmission is overheard by M single-antenna Eves. At this moment we

6B. The QoS Measure
The proposed QoS-based secret transmit beamforming designs, to be presented in the next subsection,
is based on the SINR measure. Suppose that the Alice-to-Bob channel h is random with mean h¯ and
covariance Ch. From Bob’s model (1) and the AN-aided transmit structure (3), the SINR of Bob with
respect to (w,Σ) can be defined as (see, e.g., [3])
SINRb(w,Σ) =
E{|hHws(t)|2}
E{|hHz(t)|2}+ σ2n
=
w
H
Rhw
Tr(ΣRh) + σ2n
. (5)
where
Rh = E{hh
H} = h¯h¯H +Ch (6)
is the correlation matrix of h. It will be assumed in the sequel that Rh is known to Alice. Moreover, for
the case where the instantaneous channel realization of Bob is known to Alice, we should redefine Rh
as Rh = hh
H
.
Likewise, the SINRs of Eves under the model (2) are:
SINRe,m(w,Σ) =
E{|gHmws(t)|
2}
E{|gHmz(t)|
2}+ σ2v,m
=
w
H
Rg,mw
Tr(ΣRg,m) + σ2v,m
, (7)
where, for the case where the instantaneous channel realizations of Eves are known to Alice, we define
Rg,m = gmg
H
m ; and, for the case where only Eves’ channel correlation matrices are available to Alice,
we define Rg,m = E{gmgHm} = g¯mg¯Hm +Cg,m with g¯m and Cg,m being the mean and covariance of gm
respectively. Again, Rg,1, . . . ,Rg,M are assumed to be available to Alice. We should note that for the
correlation-based CSI case, the channel covariances Cg,m characterize the uncertainty to Eves’ channels
gm in a second-order statistics sense. In particular, in an extreme setting of Rg,m = σ2g,mINt for some
σ2g,m > 0, the physical meaning is that we have no information about the channel direction of that Eve.
C. The Proposed Design Formulations
With the SINRs defined in the last subsection, we can now describe the proposed secret transmit
beamforming design formulations. As previously mentioned, our general goal is to jointly optimize the
transmit weight vector w and AN spatial covariance Σ such that Bob’s and Eves’ SINRs are enhanced
and degraded, respectively. To this end, we propose two design formulations. The first formulation is a
power minimization formulation, described as follows:
October 19, 2010 DRAFT
8Formulation 2 (maximizing Bob’s SINR subject to constraints on power and Eves’ SINRs): Given
a maximum allowable SINR threshold on Eves γe > 0 and a transmit power limit Pmax > 0, design
(w,Σ) by solving
max
w∈CNt ,Σ∈HNt
SINRb(w,Σ)
s.t. ‖w‖2 +Tr(Σ) ≤ Pmax, (11)
SINRe,m(w,Σ) ≤ γe, m = 1, . . . ,M,
Σ  0,
The design criterion of Formulation 2 is to offer the best possible SINR on Bob, given a power
specification Pmax and an SINR limit on Eves γe. Problem (11) always has a feasible solution. However,
in some instances; e.g., demanding specifications and/or having many Eves, it is possible that the best
SINR on Bob found by Problem (11) be lower than γe. Under such circumstances, the system operator
should consider relaxing the power specification Pmax such that a reasonable SINR on Bob is attained.
The goal of this paper lies in finding the optimal transmit design solutions of the above two design
formulations. This will be addressed in the following two sections.
III. OPTIMIZATION IN THE POWER MINIMIZATION DESIGN
This section considers the optimization aspects of the power minimization design for AN-aided transmit
beamforming. The first subsection studies the nature and challenge of the problem, while the second
subsection describes the proposed approach to handling the problem.
A. The Problem Nature
Let us explicitly express the power minimization design (8) as

October 19, 2010 DRAFT
10
where the constraints W  0, rank(W) = 1 in (14d) are equivalent to constraining W = wwH . In the
SDR approach, we relax (14) by neglecting the constraint rank(W) = 1 in (14d):
min

Tr(WRg,m)− Tr(Rg,mΣ) ≤ σ
2
v,m, m = 1, . . . ,M, (15c)
Σ  0, W  0. (15d)
The relaxed problem above, which we will call the SDR problem of the original design problem (12),
is convex— it is a semidefinite program whose optimal solution can be efficiently obtained by available
interior-point algorithms; e.g., the off-the-shelf solvers SeDuMi [33] and CVX [34].
The SDR (15) is generally an approximation to the AN-aided design (12), because the former does
not guarantee a rank-one optimal W given an arbitrary problem instance Rh,Rg,1, . . . ,Rg,M  0,
γb, γe > 0. There are standard methods for generating a suboptimal transmit weight w from SDR; see
[9], [32] and the references therein. But, for instances where an SDR optimal W happens to be of rank
one, we can simply extract the rank-one decomposition of that SDR optimal W (essentially, the principal
eigenvector of W) and the SDR for those instances is optimal to the original AN-aided design (12).
Interestingly, we are able to show that for a practically representative class of problem instances, SDR
always yields a rank-one transmit beamforming solution (or SDR is an exact solver of the AN-aided
design (12)). This is described in the following proposition:
Proposition 1 Consider the AN-aided power minimization design (12), and its SDR problem (15). Sup-
pose that Rh,Rg,1, . . . ,Rg,M  0 satisfy either one of the following conditions:
C1) (Instantaneous CSI on Bob) Rh = hhH , while Rg,1, . . . ,Rg,M  0 are arbitrary PSD matrices.
C2) (Correlation-based CSI on Bob and Eves, with white channel covariance) Nt > M , and the channel
correlation matrices take the form
Rh = h¯h¯
H + σ2hINt ,
Rg,m = g¯mg¯

where σ2h, σ2g,1, . . . , σ2g,M ≥ 0, and h¯, g¯1, . . . , g¯M ∈ CNt are such that h¯ /∈ Range{g¯1, . . . , g¯M}.
C3) (The number of Eves is no greater than two) M ≤ 2, and Rh,Rg,1, . . . ,Rg,M are arbitrary.

Unlike the SDR of the power minimization design, the SDR problem (17) does not immediately lead
to an SDP. The SDR problem (17) is a quasi-convex problem, due to the linear fractional structure of
its objective (17a). A standard approach to solving this kind of quasi-convex problems is to employ a
bisection methodology [5], [36], where the globally optimal solution is sequentially searched by solving
a sequence (often many) of SDPs.
Here we develop a simpler alternative to solving (17). The idea is to reformulate the quasi-convex
problem (17) to a convex SDP through the Charnes-Cooper transformation [37]. Let
η =
1
Tr(ΣRh) + σ2n
. (18)
By using the following transformation of variables
W¯ = ηW, Σ¯ = ηΣ, (19)
we may rewrite Problem (17) as an SDP

Tr(W¯) + Tr(Σ¯) ≤ ηPmax, (20d)
W¯  0, Σ¯  0, η ≥ 0, (20e)
under the assumption that an optimal solution of (20), denoted by (W¯⋆, Σ¯⋆, η⋆), has η⋆ > 0. In general,
it is true that η⋆ > 0: If η⋆ = 0, then, according to (20d), we have W¯⋆ = Σ¯⋆ = 0. However, that
(W¯⋆, Σ¯⋆, η⋆) violates (20b). Hence, we arrive at the following conclusion:
Proposition 2 The quasi-convex SDR problem in (17) is equivalent to the SDP in (20). The equivalence
lies in that if (W¯⋆, Σ¯⋆, η⋆) is optimal to (20), then (W¯⋆/η⋆, Σ¯⋆/η⋆) is optimal to (17).
The above described equivalent SDP reformulation of the SDR problem not only provides a compu-
tationally more efficient way of solving SDR (compared to the bisection search), it also sheds light into
conditions under which SDR exactly solves the SINR maximization design. By examining the equivalent
SDR problem (20), we show in Appendix D that
Proposition 3 Consider the AN-aided SINR maximization design (16), and its SDR problem (17). Suppose
that Rh,Rg,1, . . . ,Rg,M  0 satisfy either one of the following conditions
October 19, 2010 DRAFT
14
where D = Diag(σv,1, . . . , σv,M ), and A(·) : HNt → HM is a linear matrix function whose (k, ℓ)th
entry is
[A(W)](k,ℓ) = Tr
(
WRg,(ℓ,k)
)
, (23)
with Rg,(ℓ,k) = E{gℓgHk } for the correlation-based CSI case; and Rg,(ℓ,k) = gℓgHk for the instantaneous
CSI case.
Our idea is to bound SINRce(w,Σ) below a known threshold by bounding the per-Eve SINRs SINRe,m(w,Σ).
We found by analysis that bounding the per-Eve SINRs may not be enough to bound the colluding-Eve
SINR, but there is a simple remedy as described in the following proposition:
Proposition 4 Consider a variation of Formulations 1 and 2, where we add the following convex
constraint on their respective design problems in (8) and (11):

−1
A(Σ)D−1 

M
Tr

A(Σ)D−1
)
IM (24)
For such modified design problems, it holds true that any feasible (w,Σ) satisfies
SINRce(w,Σ) ≤Mγe. (25)
The proof of Proposition 4 is described in Appendix E. Proposition 4 indicates that by adding the
constraint (24) in the designs, the maximum allowable colluding-Eve SINR is constrained below Mγe
indirectly. We should emphasize that the SDRs of the resultant modified designs are simply those of
the original (Problems (15) and (20)) with the addition of the constraint (24). Those modified SDRs are
again convex SDPs, and it can be verified that the SDR rank-one optimality for Cases C1) and C2) in
Propositions 1 and 3 still holds for the modified SDRs.
B. Multigroup Multicast
In multigroup multicast, we consider a general multi-Bob setting described as follows. Alice is intended
to transmit multiple data streams to multiple groups of Bobs. The transmit signal vector at Alice becomes
x(t) =
Q∑
q=1
wqsq(t) + z(t), (26)
where Q is the number of data streams, sq(t) is the qth data stream which is assumed to be independent
of one another, wq ∈ CNt is the transmit weight vector corresponding to sq(t), and z(t) is again the AN.
There are K Bobs to be served, and the received signal of each Bob is modeled as
yb,k(t) = h
H
k x(t) + nk(t), k = 1, . . . ,K, (27)

Tr(Wq) + Tr(Σ) ≤ Pmax, (31c)
Σ  0, W1  0, . . . ,WQ  0. (31d)
The resultant SDR problem, shown above, is a quasi-convex problem. Its optimal solution can be obtained
by applying a bisection search in which a sequence of SDPs are solved; see [36] for the details.
In the study of standard multigroup multicast, it has been known that SDR may not yield rank-one
solution [7]. Hence, for the secret multigroup multicast design (30), we need a procedure that turns the
SDR solution in (31) to an approximate solution to (30). In Table I, we provide such an approximate
solution generation procedure custom-designed for (30). The principle is based on that of Gaussian
randomization; see [32] for a general review of the notion of randomization, and [7] for specific details
on randomization for standard multigroup multicast.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
We now demonstrate the performance of the proposed AN-aided secret transmit beamforming designs
by simulations. In the simulation examples to be shown soon, we will adopt either one of the following
two CSI settings:
i) Instantaneous CSI Case: Both the CSIs of Bob and Eves are instantaneous; i.e., Rh = hhH (or
Rh,k = hkh
H
k for all k for the multigroup multicast extension), and Rg,m = gmgHm for all m. The
channel realizations h,g1, . . . ,gM are i.i.d. Gaussian distributed. Specifically, in the simulations, the
channels were randomly generated by h,gm ∼ CN (0, INt/Nt) on a per-trial basis.
ii) Correlation-based CSI Case: In this case, the channels of Bob and Eves are assumed to be random
with correlation matrices given respectively by
Rh = αh¯h¯
H + (1− α)INt/Nt, (32)
Rg,m = αg¯mg¯
H
m + (1− α)INt/Nt, m = 1, . . . ,M, (33)
where α ∈ [0, 1] describes the level of channel uncertainty (α = 1 means instantaneous CSI, α = 0
means no knowledge of the channel directions at all). The channel means h¯, g¯1, . . . , g¯M are isotropically

designs, corresponding to the result in (a); (c) transmit powers versus the number of Eves; and (d) the power

The simulation results are shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(a), the average transmit powers of the various
designs are plotted over a wide range of values of 1/σ2v . Note that large 1/σ2v physically means strong
(clean) overhearing ability for Eves, while small 1/σ2v means weak (noisy) overhearing ability. We observe
that for 1/σ2v < −10dB, the powers used in all the designs are quite similar. This is because the designs
do not need to spend much resource to deal with weak Eves. However, for 1/σ2v > 0dB, there are
significant performance differences. The proposed AN-aided design generally yields the smallest powers
among the three designs, and its performance gaps relative to the other two designs are wider as 1/σ2v
increases. For example, at 1/σ2v = 20dB, the performance gap between the proposed and no-AN designs

We should point out that Proposition 3 shows sufficient conditions for which SDR is provably optimal
to the SINR maximization design, but they are not necessary. Our empirical observation discussed above
reflects that SDR is practically more powerful than what the presently available analysis outlines.
C. Example 3: Colluding Eves, Power Minimization Design, Instantaneous CSI Case
This example considers the colluding-Eve scenario. The simulation settings are the same as those in
Example 1. We should reiterate that the proposed design incorporates the indirect method in Proposition 4
for bounding the colluding-Eve SINR. As for the no-AN and isotropic AN designs, their simple transmit
structures enable them to deal with the colluding-Eve SINR (cf., (22)) directly. In the simulation, the
maximum allowable colluding-Eve SINR threshold is set to Mγe = 5dB. The simulation results are
shown in Fig. 4. We see that the proposed design exhibits marginal performance loss compared to the
no-AN design for −10dB < 1/σ2v < −5dB, but the proposed design outperform the other two designs
for 1/σ2v > 0dB.
D. Example 4: Multigroup Multicast, Max-Min-Fair Design, Instantaneous CSI Case
This last example demonstrates the viability of the proposed design in the multigroup multicast scenario.
We consider a two-group multicast transmission, where there are four Bobs and two Bobs form one group
(thereby K = 4, Q = 2, G1 = {1, 2},G2 = {3, 4}). There are four Eves (M = 4). The number of transmit

VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have established a secret transmit beamforming approach using a QoS-oriented
perspective. A particularly meaningful part of this work is judicious utilization of artificial noise, via
joint optimization of its spatial distribution and the transmit weights. This has enabled us to cripple
eavesdroppers’ interceptions significantly, as compared to a no-AN approach or an isotropic AN approach.
The formulated designs turn out to be difficult optimization problems, and we employ the SDR technique
to approximate the designs. Interestingly, we show that SDR is actually an exact solver of the formulated
designs for a practically representative class of problem instances. The extensions to the multigroup
multicast scenario and the colluding-Eve scenario are also considered. Simulation results show that
the proposed AN-aided transmit beamforming designs are highly effective in blocking eavesdroppers’
interceptions, especially when there are many eavesdroppers and/or when the eavesdroppers’ channels
have good overhearing ability.

Case C1): The idea of the proof is that the KKT conditions of the SDR problem (15) automatically
restrict its optimal solution (W⋆,Σ⋆) to have rank-one W⋆. Let λ⋆ ≥ 0 be an optimal dual variable for
the constraint (15b), µ⋆m ≥ 0, m = 1, . . . ,M , be those for the constraints (15c), and Y⋆  0 be that for
the constraint W  0. We consider only the KKT equations relevant to W⋆, given as follows:
Y
⋆ = INt +

Rh  0, (A.4a)
Y
⋆
W
⋆ = 0, (A.4b)
λ⋆ ≥ 0, µ⋆m ≥ 0, m = 1, . . . ,M. (A.4c)
Eq. (A.4b) implies that the columns of W⋆ must lie in the nullspace of Y⋆. Therefore, we get
rank(W⋆) ≤ Nullity(Y⋆) = Nt − rank(Y
⋆). (A.5)
We will show that the occurrence of C1) implies that rank(Y⋆) ≥ Nt−1, and, subsequently, rank(W⋆) ≤
1. Since W⋆ = 0 is not a feasible point due to (15b), the remaining possibility is that rank(W⋆) = 1.
Under Case C1), the KKT equation (A.4a) can be expressed as
Y
⋆ = B− λ⋆hhH , (A.6)
B = INt +
M∑
m=1
µ⋆mRg,m. (A.7)
Since Rg,m  0 and µ⋆m ≥ 0 for all m = 1, . . . ,M , the matrix B in (A.7) is positive definite. Thus, its
square root factor B1/2 is invertible. Using this result, we can rewrite (A.6) as
Y
⋆ = B−1/2(INt − λ
⋆(B1/2h)(B1/2h)H)B−1/2. (A.8)
From (A.8) and by basic matrix analysis concepts, one can show that
rank(Y⋆) = rank(INt − λ
⋆(B1/2h)(B1/2h)H), (A.9)
and that rank(INt − λ⋆(B1/2h)(B1/2h)H) ≥ Nt − 1 due to the underlying matrix structure. As a result,
we have rank(Y⋆) ≥ Nt − 1 under Case C1).
Case C2): The proof is similar to that of Case C1), where the key is to prove that rank(Y⋆) ≥ Nt− 1.

Furthermore, consider that Rh ≻ 0. Then, an optimal solution to (A.17), denoted by (w⋆,Σ⋆), must

Eq. (A.18) suggests that (w⋆,0) yields an objective value greater than (w⋆,Σ⋆). Since (w⋆,0) is also

1constraint where the eavesdropper is not allowed to infer any information from its received
signal, a non-zero secrecy capacity in a static channel can only be achieved when the legitimate
receiver has a better channel condition than the eavesdropper. Yet, this can be overcome in
wireless environments by exploiting the time-varying characteristic of fading channels [2], [3].
Further enhancements are attainable by employing multiple antennas at the transceivers, e.g., in
[4]–[6]. However, most of these works rely on perfect knowledge of the legitimate receiver’s and
the eavesdropper’s channels. To guarantee secrecy without knowing the eavesdropper channel,
the work in [5] proposed the use of artificial noise (AN) in the null space of the legitimate
channel to disrupt the eavesdropper’s reception. The secret message is then beamformed towards
the legitimate receiver on top of the AN. With perfect knowledge of the legitimate receiver’s
channel direction information (CDI) at the transmitter, it has been shown that the secrecy rate
achievable by using AN can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the transmission power.
However, this may not be the case in practice since in general only quantized CDI is available
at the transmitter due to rate-limitations on the feedback channel.
The main contribution of this paper is to study the impact of quantized CDI on the secrecy
rate achievable by AN-assisted beamforming. Although the optimal signaling scheme is unknown
for cases without knowledge of the eavesdropper’s channel, AN-assisted beamforming has been
shown to be optimal in the high SNR regime when the transmitter has full knowledge of the
legitimate receiver’s channel and is equipped with a large number of antennas [4]. This scheme
is also optimal when the transmitter perfectly knows both the legitimate receiver’s and the
eavesdropper’s channels [6]. When only quantized CDI is available at the transmitter, the AN
that was originally intended to disrupt the eavesdropper’s reception may now leak into the
legitimate channel, causing degradation in the achievable secrecy rate. We refer to this as the
AN leakage problem.
In this work, we first examine the optimal power allocation between the message-bearing
signal and the AN for a given number of feedback bits B. We show that, when B is sufficiently
large (good CDI quality), the power should be allocated evenly among the message-bearing
signal and the AN; whereas, when B is small (poor CDI quality), the power allocated to the
AN must be more conservative in order to limit the effects of AN leakage. Moreover, when B
is fixed, we observe that in contrast to the perfect CDI case, the achievable secrecy rate will

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND BACKGROUND
Let us consider a wireless system that consists of a transmitter, a legitimate receiver, and an
eavesdropper with Mt, Mr, and Me antennas, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. The system
model presented in this section is focused only on the MISOSE case where Mt > Me = Mr = 1;
while extensions to the MIMOME case (where Me ≥ 1 and Mr ≥ 1) will be presented in Section
VI. Let x[i] ∈ CMt×1 be the symbol vector transmitted in the ith time slot under the average
power constraint E [‖x[i]‖2] ≤ P . The signals received at the receiver and the eavesdropper are
yr[i] = hrx[i] + zr[i] and ye[i] = hex[i] + ze[i], (1)
respectively, where hr,he ∈ C1×Mt are channel vectors of the receiver and the eavesdropper,
respectively, with the same distribution CN (0, IMt), and zr[i] ∼ CN (0, 1), ze[i] ∼ CN (0, σ2e)
are the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Note that, in this case, the channel directions
gr = hr/‖hr‖ and ge = he/‖he‖ are isotropically distributed on the unit sphere [12]. In this
paper, we will assume that hr and he are ergodic block-fading channels that remain constant
over a sufficient amount of time for signal transmission and feedback, and the messages are
coded across multiple fading blocks (c.f. (9) below). Our results can be readily extended to the
case with ergodic fast-fading channels [3].
Most works on physical-layer secrecy consider the problem of reliably communicating a secret
message from the transmitter to the legitimate receiver subject to a constraint on the information
attainable by the eavesdropper. Consider a (2nR, n)-code with an encoder μn : Wn → CMt×n
that maps the message w ∈ Wn = {1, 2, . . . , 2nR} into a length-n codeword {x[i]}ni=1 and a
decoder νn at the legitimate receiver that maps the received sequence {yr[i]}ni=1 to an estimated
message wˆ ∈ Wn. Define the error event as En = {wˆ = w}. Perfect secrecy and secrecy capacity
are defined as follows.
Definition 1 (Secrecy Capacity [2] [4]): Perfect secrecy is achievable with rate R if, for any
ε′ > 0, there exists a sequence of (2nR, n)-codes and an integer n0 such that, for any n > n0,
Pr(En) ≤ ε′, and H(w|{ye[i]}ni=1,hnr ,hne )/n > R− ε′,
September 16, 2010 DRAFT
5To gain analytical insights on the impact of quantized CDI, we adopt the random vector quantiza-
tion (RVQ) codebook [7], [8], where each codeword is a randomly and independently generated
Mt-dimensional unit-norm complex Gaussian vector and, thus, is isotropically distributed in
C
1×Mt [12]. Moreover, we will also utilize the quantization cell approximation (QCA) model
[7], [14], where each quantization cell V is approximated by a Voronoi region of a spherical cap
with the surface area approximately equal to 2−B of the total surface area of the Mt-dimensional
unit sphere. It has been shown in [7], [8] that the behavior of RVQ can be closely approximated
by this model, even for small B. Specifically, the quantization cell V in (3) is approximated by
V ≈ {g| |gcH |2 ≥ 1− δ}, δ = 2−

Define |grgˆHr |2 = |grcH |2  cos2 θ ≥ 1 − δ. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of
sin2 θ is [7]

(5)
When only the quantized CDI gˆr is available at the transmitter, the beamforming vector p
and the matrix Q in (2) are set to gˆHr and Ngˆr , respectively, where Ngˆr has columns that form
an orthonormal basis for the null space of gˆr. Therefore, the transmitted signal is given by
x[i] = gˆHr s[i] +Ngˆra[i]. (6)
Note that finding the optimal p and Q under quantized CDI is in general difficult due to AN
leakage. Our choice of using p = gˆr is motivated by [7] [9] where the multi-user interference
in their case has a similar effect as the AN leakage in our case. To satisfy the power constraint
E[‖x[i]‖2]=σ2s+(Mt−1)σ2a≤P , we set σ2s =αP and σ2a= (1−α)PMt−1 , where α ∈ [0, 1] denotes the
fraction of power allocation. Since the eavesdropper’s noise variance σ2e is assumed unknown
to the transmitter, we shall consider throughout the rest of this paper the worst-case scenario
where σ2e = 0. By (1), the received signals of the receiver and the eavesdropper are given by
yˆr[i] = ‖hr‖(grgˆHr )s[i] + ‖hr‖(grNgˆr)a[i] + zr[i], (7)
and yˆe[i] = hegˆHr s[i] + heNgˆra[i], (8)
respectively. One can observe from (7) that, due to imperfect CDI, the AN that was originally
intended for the eavesdropper also interferes with the legitimate receiver. By assuming that s[i]

such that Rˆ(α) ∼= (F (α))+. By taking the derivative of F (α) and setting it to zero, i.e., ∂F (α)∂α = 0,

Although a closed-form solution of α is not easily computable due to the intractability of
the expectation term in (15), explicit results can be obtained for two interesting special cases,
namely, the case of weak AN leakage and the case of strong AN leakage. In the case of weak
AN leakage, B is assumed sufficiently large such that AN leakage is much smaller than AWGN,
i.e. γgˆ⊥r (1 − α)P  1. On the other hand, in the case of strong AN leakage, B is assumed to
be small such that γgˆ⊥r (1− α)P  1. For the former case, we have the following proposition:

. Then, for B > (Mt − 1) log(P/) and any  such that
1−αw

>  > 0, the optimal power allocation fraction α of Rˆ(α) in (13) satisfies αw− l < α <
αw + u for Mt sufficiently large, where both u, l > 0 and will approach 0 as  approaches 0.
The proof is provided in Appendix B. Note that d(α) comes from (15). Numerically, we
can show that αw ≈ 0.554. The fact that α is close to one half can also be roughly observed
from (9). Specifically, with B sufficiently large, AN leakage will be negligible and the first
term in (9) will be proportional to logα when Mt is large. Also, by applying the approximation

where we have used the fact that ‖heNgr‖2 = ‖he‖2−|hegHr |2. The same argument also applies
to the second term inside (·)+ in (19) since ge and gˆr are also independent and isotropically
distributed under RVQ. Therefore, the second terms inside (·)+ in both (18) and (19) yield the

proaches to 0 as Mt or P increases. Hence, to guarantee a constant secrecy rate loss, B must
scale linearly with Mt or logarithmically with P , i.e., B = Ω(Mt logP ) in big-Ω notation [17].

VI. EXTENSIONS TO THE MIMOME SCENARIO
In this section, we extend our studies to the MIMOME scenario where Mr, Me ≥ 1, and
derive the scaling of the number of feedback bits B under this scenario. The received signals at
the receiver and the eavesdropper can be expressed as
yr = Hrx+ zr and ye = Hex, (24)
where we have assumed that the eavesdropper does not suffer from noise. As in the MISOSE
case, the channel matrices Hr ∈ CMr×Mt and He ∈ CMe×Mt are assumed to be ergodic block
faded, with each entry being i.i.d. complex Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance.
Assume that Mt ≥ Mr +Me. Let Hr = VΣUH be the singular value decomposition of Hr,
where V ∈ CMr×Mr is a unitary matrix, Σ ∈ CMr×Mr is a diagonal matrix with the singular
values of Hr being the diagonal elements, and U ∈ CMt×Mr is a semi-unitary matrix. The
transmitter knows a quantized version of the CDI, i.e., Uˆ ∈ CMt×Mr . Let NUˆ ∈ CMt×(Mt−Mr)
be a matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis for the null space of UˆH , the transmitted
signal is given by x = Uˆs+NUˆa, where s ∈ CMr is the message-bearing signal with distribution
CN (0, σ2sIMr), and a ∈ CMt−Mr is the imposed AN with distribution CN (0, σ2aIMt−Mr). We let
σ2s = αP/Mr and σ2a = (1− α)P/(Mt −Mr) where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1, in order to constrain the
transmission power within P . Substituting x = Uˆs+NUˆa and Hr = VΣUH into (24) yields
yr = VΣU
HUˆs+VΣUHNUˆa+ zr and ye = HeUˆs+HeNUˆa. (25)
Since UHNUˆ = 0, the legitimate receiver will experience AN leakage, resulting in the following
achievable secrecy rate [5]
RˆM(α) =
(
E
[
log
∣∣∣IMr + σ2sUˆHUΣ (IMr + σ2aΣUHNUˆNHUˆUΣ)−1ΣUHUˆ

− E
[
log
∣∣∣IMr + σ2sUˆHHHe (σ2aHeNUˆNHUˆHHe )−1HeUˆ
∣∣∣ ])+. (26)
Similar to the MISOSE case, the secrecy rate due to imperfect CDI also converges to a constant
as P goes to infinity. For the case where perfect CDI is available at the transmitter, the transmit
signal is given by x = Us+NUa. Since UHU = IMr and UHNU = 0, the achievable MIMOME
secrecy rate with perfect CDI is given by
RM(α) =
(
E
[
log
∣∣IMr+Σ2σ2s ∣∣]−E [log ∣∣∣IMr + σ2sUHHHe (σ2aHeNUNHUHHe )−1HeU∣∣∣])+. (27)

arguments as in the MISOSE case and by the fact that NUNHU = IMr −UUH and NUˆNHUˆ =
IMr − UˆUˆ
H
, the second terms inside (.)+ of (27) and (26) turn out to be identical. Hence the
MIMOME secrecy rate loss ΔRM  maxαRM(α)−maxα RˆM(α) can be upper bounded as
ΔRM ≤ E
(
log
∣∣IMr +Σ2σ2s ∣∣)− E(log ∣∣∣IMr + σ2s UˆHUΣΩ−1ΣUHUˆ∣∣∣)
≤ E (log ∣∣IMr +Σ2σ2s ∣∣)− E(log ∣∣∣σ2s UˆHUΣΩ−1ΣUHUˆ∣∣∣) , (31)
where Ω  IMr +σ2a ΣUHNUˆNHUˆUΣ, and σ

s = α

a = (1− αp,M)P/(Mt −Mr)
in which αp,M = argmaxαRM(α). By Lemma 2, we have that UˆHU = UˆHUˆXY+ UˆH SˆR =
XY. Since X and Y are statistically independent (by Lemma 2), it follows with probability one
that UˆHU is full rank [19]. Hence, the secrecy rate loss ΔRM can be further bounded by
ΔRM ≤E
[
log
∣∣IMr +Σ−2/σ2s ∣∣]+ E [log |Ω|]− E [log ∣∣∣UHUˆUˆHU∣∣∣]
≤ log ∣∣IMr + E [Σ−2] /σ2s ∣∣+ log ∣∣IMr + σ2a E[Σ2]E[RHR]∣∣− E[log ∣∣YHY∣∣] , (32)
where the second inequality follows from Jensen’s inequality, the statistical independence be-
tween Σ and UHUˆUˆHU [19], and Lemma 2.
For the first term in (32), since E [Tr ((HrHHr )−1)] = E [Tr(Σ−2)] = Mr/(Mt −Mr) [19],
log
∣∣∣∣IMr + E [Σ−2] 1σ2s
∣∣∣∣ ≤ Mr log

Tr (IMr + E [Σ
−2])
Mrσ2s
)
= Mr log
(
1 +
1/σ2s
Mt −Mr
)
,
where the first inequality is due to the fact that |A| 1Mr ≤ Tr(A)/Mr for any Mr×Mr Hermitian
positive semidefinite matrix A. For the second term in (32), by Lemma 2 and the fact that
E [Σ2] = MtIMr [19], one can show that
log
∣∣IMr + σ2a E[Σ2]E[RHR]∣∣ = Mr log (1 + σ2a MtD/Mr) . (33)
The third term −E (log ∣∣YHY∣∣) in (32) is, however, difficult to evaluate. By applying Jensen’s in-
equality and Lemma 2, we have −E [log ∣∣YHY∣∣] ≥ − log ∣∣E [YHY]∣∣ = −Mr log (1−D/Mr).
We note that (by (29)) the right-hand side (RHS) of this inequality approaches zero for B
sufficiently large; while the term log
∣∣YHY∣∣ = log ∣∣∣UHUˆUˆHU∣∣∣ is also close to zero with
high probability for B sufficiently large due to random quantization codebook. We therefore
make the approximation −E [log ∣∣YHY∣∣] ≈ −Mr log (1−D/Mr) for B sufficiently large. By
substituting these results into (32), we obtain

large P , one can observe that the secrecy rate with quantized CDI in (9) approaches the upper
bound in (23) (for both cases of B = 10 and B = 32), which coincides with our discussions in
Section V and demonstrates that additional CQI at the transmitter only provides little gain on
the achievable secrecy rate as P is large.
We show in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 the MIMOME secrecy rate in (26) versus α and P , respectively.
The numbers of antennas of the receiver and the eavesdropper are set as 2 (Mr = Me = 2).
Similar observations as in the MISOSE case can be seen from the two figures, that is, the
optimum α decreases to around 0.5 when B increases, and the secrecy rate is upper bounded
for finite B. The MIMOME bit scaling law in (35) is also examined, and the results are shown
in Fig. 8. Although the lower bound in (35) is derived through some approximations, one can
see from Fig. 8 that constant secrecy rate loss can still be maintained using this bit scaling law.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
We have examined the impact of quantized CDI on the secrecy rate achievable with AN-
assisted beamforming. In view of the AN leakage problem, we have analyzed the optimal power
allocation strategy to maximize the achievable secrecy rate under quantized CDI. Moreover, to
maintain a constant secrecy rate loss compared to the perfect CDI case, we have shown that the
number of feedback bits B must be scaled logarithmically with the transmission power P for
both the MISOSE and the MIMOME cases. The presented simulation results have confirmed
our analytical results.
APPENDIX
A. Proof of Lemma 1
Since he ∼ CN (0, IMt), from [20, Chapter 5] we know that |hegˆr|2 and ‖heNgˆr‖2 are
independent and distributed as v2 and v2Mt−2, respectively, where vk is chi-square distributed
with degree of freedom k. Hence, it follows that

where the last equality follows by v2Mt−2/(2(Mt − 1)) a.s.→ 1 as Mt → ∞ from the law of large
numbers (LLN). Then, eq. (12) follows by evaluating the expectation over v2. 

where (a) follows from the fact that 0 ≤ γgˆ⊥r P <  under event A and that 1 − α < 1, (b)
follows by the definition of γgˆr in (14), and (c) is due to the fact that BMt−1 > log(P/) and
that |grgˆHr |2 = cos2 θ ≥ 1 − δ = 1 − 2−
B
Mt−1 (which follows from the QCA model in (4)).
Moreover, with the fact that ‖hr‖2/Mt a.s.−→ 1 as Mt → ∞ (which follows by the LLN), we
also have from (14) that γgˆ⊥r = ‖hr‖

1/Mt approaches 0. Then (39) becomes

Now, let us prove that α < αw + u. Similarly, by (15), we can write
d(α) = E
[
γgˆrP (γgˆ⊥r P + 1)(1− α)

where the last inequality comes from the fact that α > αw − l proven previously. Since
Pr (A) → 1 as Mt → ∞, the second term in (41) can be made arbitrarily small for Mt
sufficiently large. Hence, it follows that, for Mt sufficiently large,
d(α) < E

inequality into (46) gives rise to (21). Theorem 1 is then proved. 
E. Proof of Theorem 2
Basically, we modify [2, Appendix B] to reach (49) and derive new results based on (49).
First, let us define yˆnr ={yˆr[i]}ni=1, yˆne ={yˆe[i]}ni=1 and sn={s[i]}ni=1. By Definition 1, for any ε′ > 0
and n > n0, the achievable secrecy rate Rˆ can be upper bounded as
nRˆ− nε′ < H(w|yˆne ,hnr ,hne )
(a)
≤ I(w; yˆnr |yˆne ,hnr ,hne ) + nε1
(b)
≤ I(sn; yˆnr |yˆne ,hnr ,hne ) + nε1, (47)
where (a) follows from Fano’s inequality for any ε1 > 0 and sufficiently large n [2], and (b)
follows from the Markov relation w ↔ sn ↔ (yˆnr , yˆne ). According to the channel model in (7)
and (8), it can be shown [2] that
I(s; yˆr|yˆe,hr = h˜r,he = h˜e) = [I(s; yˆr|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)− I(s; yˆe|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)]+ (48)
for a certain fading state (h˜r, h˜e). With (47) and (48), and by following [2] we have
Rˆ ≤
∫ ∫
[I(s; yˆr|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)−I(s; yˆe|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)]+N(h˜r, h˜e)
n
dh˜rdh˜e+ε2, (49)
where ε2 = ε1+ ε′ and N(h˜r, h˜e) denotes the number of times for which the channel (hr,he) is
in fading state (h˜r, h˜e) over the n channel uses. Notice that, for a given channel state (h˜r, h˜e), (7)
and (8) is equivalent to a scalar Gaussian wiretap channel, and therefore [I(s; yˆr|hr = h˜r,he =
h˜e) − I(s; yˆe|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)]+ in (49) is maximum with Gaussian s (see [21]). Then, as
[2], we denote the average power of s[i] and a[i] over the channels (hr[i],he[i]) = (h˜r, h˜e) in
n channel uses as P ns and P na , respectively. It is easy to see that
[I(s; yˆr|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)− I(s; yˆe|hr = h˜r,he = h˜e)]+

a single antenna and the UR has NU > 1 antennas. Denote
by h ∈ CNt and G ∈ CNt×NU the channel vector of the LR
and the channel matrix of the UR, respectively. The channel
is assumed to remain constant over a coherence interval that
consists of a training phase with length TCE and a data
transmission phase with length TD. Specifically, the transceiver
processing we consider is described as follows:
Training phase: The transmitter first sends a training
sequence (which is known to both LR and UR) to enable
channel estimation at both receivers. Let hˆ and Gˆ denote the
associated channel estimates. The LR will feedback hˆ to the
transmitter for the beamforming design in the ensuing data
transmission phase.
Data transmission phase: With the channel estimate hˆ fed
back from LR, the transmitter employs the ANBF scheme
[2] for data transmission. Here, we assume that UR does
not feedback its channel and is able to intercept the channel
estimate hˆ sent by LR. Both LR and UR will use their channel
estimates hˆ and Gˆ for data detection, respectively.
The channel estimation performances at the receivers have
significant impact on their data detection performances and,
thus, the training sequence in the channel estimation phase
and the ANBF signal in the data transmission phase can be
jointly designed to further enhance the difference between LR
and UR’s detection performances. Next, let us first review the
ANBF and the DCE schemes mentioned above.
A. Review of AN-Aided Transmit Beamforming
In the ANBF scheme, the message is sent towards the esti-
mated LR’s direction using beamforming, and AN is imposed
in the null space of the estimated LR’s channel in order
to interrupt UR’s reception. Specifically, given the channel
estimate hˆ, the signal transmitted under ANBF is given by
[2]
x(t) =
√
σ2s
(
hˆ
‖hˆ‖
)
s(t) +
√
σ2a
Nt − 1
N
hˆ
· a(t), (1)
for t = 1, . . . , TD, where s(t) is the information signal, with
E{|s(t)|2} = 1, N
hˆ
∈ CNt×(Nt−1) is a matrix which spans
the left null space of hˆ and satisfies both NH
hˆ
N
hˆ
= INt−1 (the
(Nt − 1)× (Nt − 1) identity matrix) and hˆHNhˆ = 0, a(t) ∈
CNt−1 is an AN vector where the entries are independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian random
variables with zero mean and unit variance, and σ2s ≥ 0
and σ2a ≥ 0 represent information signal and AN powers,
respectively.
The received signals of LR and UR are given by
y(t) = hHx(t) + w(t), (2)
z(t) = GHx(t) + v(t), (3)
respectively, where w(t) is the additive noise at LR with zero
mean and variance σ2w, and v(t) is the additive noise vector
at UR with zero mean and covariance matrix σ2vINU .
When the channel estimate is perfect, i.e., when hˆ = h, it
follows from (1), (2), (3) and the fact that hˆHN
hˆ
= 0 that
the received signals can be written as
y(t) =
√
σ2s‖hˆ‖s(t) + w(t), (4)
z(t) =
√
σ2s
G
H
hˆ
‖hˆ‖
s(t) +
√
σ2a
Nt − 1
G
H
N
hˆ
a(t) + v(t). (5)
This shows that only UR will be affected by AN when the
transmitter has perfect knowledge of the channel h. However,
if hˆ 6= h, we have hHN
hˆ
6= 0 and, thus, AN will leak into
LR’s channel reducing the achievable SINR [8].
It is worthwhile to note that ANBF is not always effective in
degrading UR’s performance, especially when UR has a large
number of antennas and perfectly knows its own channel G
[6]. To see this, let us assume that NU ≥ Nt and Gˆ = G,
and let us express the received signal at UR as
z(t) = GHQ
hˆ
[
s(t)
a(t)
]
+ v(t), (6)
where
Q
hˆ
,
[√
σ2s
(
hˆ
‖hˆ‖
) √
σ2a
Nt−1
N
hˆ
]
. (7)
In this case, UR can estimate the information signal s(t)
simply by inverting the effective channel GHQ
hˆ
and by taking
the term corresponding to s(t), e.g., by computing
[1 0T ] Q−1
hˆ
(GH)†z(t) = s(t) + [1 0T ] Q−1
hˆ
(GH)†v(t), (8)
where Q−1
hˆ
and (GH)† denote the inverse of Q
hˆ
and the
pseudo inverse of GH , respectively. Equation (8) implies that
UR can be free from the interfering AN. However, if UR has
an imperfect channel estimate, i.e., Gˆ 6= G, there always exists
residual AN in (8) which will still interfere with UR.
The above discussions reveal the need of a training scheme
that can enable LR to estimate h accurately while preventing
UR from obtaining an accurate estimate of G, as described in
the next subsection.
B. Review of Discriminatory Channel Estimation
The key idea of DCE is to utilize the channel estimate fed
back from LR to judiciously allocate AN in the training signal
to disrupt the channel estimation at UR [5].
Specifically, the transmitter will send a sequence of K + 1
training signals Xk ∈ CNt×Tk for k = 0, . . . ,K , where Tk is
the training length at stage k and
∑K
k=0 Tk = TCE. Let hˆk−1
be the channel estimate of the LR by using X0, . . . ,Xk−1.
The training signals Xk for k = 0, 1, . . . ,K, are given by
Xk =
√
PkTk

Ck +


√


 δ[k − 1], (9)
where δ[·] is the unit step function, Pk ≥ 0 and σ2a,k ≥ 0
are the respective training data power and AN power at
stage k, Ck ∈ CNt×Tk represents the training data matrix
satisfying CkCHk = INt , Nhˆk−1 ∈ C
Nt×(Nt−1) is a matrix
that satisfies NH
hˆk−1
N
hˆk−1

where

Nt − 1
)
E{GHN
hˆ
N
H
hˆ
G | hˆ, Gˆ}+ σ2vINU . (21)
By (A1) and (A2) and after some lengthy computations, one
can further show that
SINRU(hˆ, Gˆ)
= σ2s
(
Nt − 1
σ2a
)(

where Tr(·) denotes the trace of a matrix, β = (σ2s +
σ2a)NMSEU + σ
2
v , and the inequality in (22) is due to
Tr(GˆGˆH)INt − GˆGˆ
H  0 (a positive semidefinite matrix).
Thus an upper bound for UR’s average SINR is given by
SINRU = E{SINRU(hˆ, Gˆ)} ≤
σ2s

Tr(GˆGˆH)

where the last equality is obtained from the fact that
E{GˆGˆH} = NU (σ

G −NMSEU)INt .
B. Joint Power Allocation of DEC and ANBF (DCE-ANBF)
One can observe from (18) and (23) that the channel estima-
tion performances NMSEL and NMSEU in the training phase
have direct impacts on the achievable SINR performances of
LR and UR, respectively. This implies that we should jointly
optimize the DCE scheme in the training phase and ANBF in
the data transmission phase, in order to effectively discriminate
between LR and UR’s SINR performances. In particular, let
us consider the following joint power allocation problem:
max
{Pk≥0}

a,k≥0}
K
k=1,

a)TD ≤ E . (24b)
In (24), γ is a preset SINR constraint for UR, E > 0 stands
for the average energy constraint, and NMSEL and NMSEU
are given in (11) and (13), respectively. As seen from (24),
we aim to maximize LR’s SINR [in (18)] while limiting the
SINR achievable by UR [in (23)] to a value no greater than
γ, under the total energy constraint (24b). The optimization
problem in (24) is in general not convex and difficult to solve;
however a suboptimal solution can be obtained by applying
the techniques of monomial approximation and condensation
method in the context of geometric programming (GP) [10].
These techniques involve solving a sequence of convex GPs
and hence can be implemented efficiently. Readers are referred
to [5] and [10] for the details.
To compare with the proposed joint power allocation prob-
lem in (24) which uses DCE in the training phase, we also con-
sider the joint design problem that employs the conventional
channel estimation (CCE) scheme [7] (without considering
URs) in the training phase. This simple training scheme
corresponds to a training signal in (9) with only K = 0 (i.e.,
no AN), and has the following NMSEs
NMSEL=
(
1
σ2h
+
P0TCE
Ntσ2w
)−1
, NMSEU=
(
1
σ2G
+
P0TCE
Ntσ2v
)−1
for LR and UR, respectively. One can also consider jointly
optimizing the CCE scheme and ANBF. The optimal power
allocation problem for the joint CCE and ANBF (CCE-
ANBF) scheme is identical to (24) except that the optimization
variables reduce to (P0, σ2s , σ2a), the energy constraint in (24b)
reduces to P0TCE + (σ2s + σ2a)TD ≤ E , and the NMSEL and
NMSEU above are used. Again, the monomial approximation
and condensation method can be applied to deal with the
associated joint power allocation problem.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we present some simulation results to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design
formulation. The wireless system as described in Sec. II is
considered with Nt = 4 and NU = 4. The elements of the
channels h and G are i.i.d. complex Gaussian distributed with
zero mean and unit variance (σ2h = σ2G = 1). We assume that
the coherence time is 400 which contains a training phase with
length 100 (TCE = 100) and a data transmission phase with
length 300 (TD = 300). The total energy constraint E is set
to 400 (E = 400). For DCE, we set K = 3, and hence the
training length of each stage is 25 (Tk = 25 for k = 0, . . . , 3).
The standard solver CVX [11] is used to solve the GPs in
the condensation method for handling (24). The information
signals s(t), t = 1, . . . , 300, in the data transmission phase are
uniformly drawn from 64-QAM signals. LR detects s(t) from
(15) using the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion; while UR
first applies MSINRC to (19) followed by ML detection of
s(t). We evaluate the average symbol error rates (SERs) of
the two receivers over 5, 000 channel realizations.
In the first example, we compare the performances of the
DEC-ANBF scheme and the CCE-ANBF scheme in discrim-
inating between LR and UR’s reception performances. Figure
1 shows the simulation results of SERs versus 1/σ2v for
1/σ2w = 24 dB. For fair comparison, we set γ = 22 dB for
DCE-ANBF, and γ = 26 dB for CCE-ANBF since, under
this setting, both schemes yield similar SERs for UR (see the
dashed lines in Fig. 1). One can clearly see that DCE-ANBF
has a better capability in discriminating between the reception
performances of LR and UR, especially when UR is in
good channel conditions (i.e., 1/σ2v is large). For moderate to
small 1/σ2v , both schemes exhibit comparable discrimination

ABSTRACT
This paper considers a multiuser transmit beamforming de-
sign in the presence of Gaussian distributed channel errors
at the transmitter. We study a stochastic robust design
problem that minimizes the transmission power subject to
probabilistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
constraints on the receivers. While the probabilistically-
constrained design problem is difficult to solve, we present a
conservative approximation formulation that guarantees the
satisfaction of the probabilistic SINR requirements. The pro-
posed conservative formulation is reminiscent of the worst-
case robust design problem with spherically bounded chan-
nel errors, and can be efficiently handled by semidefinite re-
laxation. The presented simulation results show that the
proposed approach outperforms the existing methods and
requires less transmission powers under the same SINR re-
quirement.
1. INTRODUCTION
Multiuser transmit beamforming designs that take into ac-
count channel state information (CSI) errors at the transmit-
ter, or so called robust transmit beamforming, have drawn
significant attention recently [1–6]. Depending on the CSI er-
ror model, robust transmit beamforming can be divided into
two classes: The worst-case robust design and the stochas-
tic robust design. The worst-case robust design assumes
a bounded channel error model, and the beamforming vec-
tors are designed such that the receivers’ quality-of-service
(QoS) requirements are fulfilled for all channels satisfying
this model; e.g., see the works in [2] where the symbol mean
squared error is used as the receiver’s QoS measure, and also
in [3] for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) based
QoS measure. In the stochastic robust design, the channel
error is assumed to be random, following certain statistical
distribution, and the beamforming vectors are designed such
that the QoS requirement are met with a high probability.
See [4–6] for the related works.
In this paper, we are interested in the stochastic ro-
bust transmit beamforming design. Specifically, we assume
that the channel errors are independent and identically dis-
tributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian random vectors, and
consider the design formulation in [4] where the transmis-
sion power is minimized subject to probabilistic SINR con-
straints. The probabilistic SINR constraints guarantee that
the beamforming design provides each receiver with a preset,

often high, probability that the desired SINR specification is
satisfied (i.e., a high SINR satisfaction probability). The
associated design problem is difficult because the probabilis-
tic SINR constraints in general do not posses any tractable
form. To efficiently handle this problem, conservative ap-
proaches, which can yield approximate solutions satisfying
the probabilistic SINR requirements, have been proposed.
For example, the conservative approaches presented in [4]
can obtain such approximate solutions by simply solving a
convex semidefinite program (SDP).
In this paper, we present a new conservative approach to
approximating the probabilistically-constrained robust de-
sign problem. The idea of the proposed approach is to bypass
the difficult probabilistic SINR constraints and replace them
by worst-case SINR constraints with spherically bounded
channel errors. We show that the spherically-bounded worst-
case SINR constraints guarantee the satisfaction of the orig-
inal probabilistic SINR constraints in the sense that the for-
mer constraints correspond to a problem feasible set that
is subsumed by the latter constraints. The resultant con-
servative formulation resembles the worst-case robust trans-
mit beamforming problem considered in [3,7], and hence can
be conveniently handled by a semedefinite relaxation (SDR)
based method [7]. Moreover, we illustrate that the level of
conservatism of the proposed formulation can be reduced by
a bisection methodology. Simulation results to be presented
will demonstrate that the proposed conservative approach
outperforms the methods in [4], and meanwhile draws less
transmission powers under the same SINR requirement.
2. SIGNAL MODEL AND PROBLEM
STATEMENT
2.1 Signal Model
We consider a multiuser wireless system that consists of
a multiple-antenna transmitter and K single-antenna re-
ceivers. We assume that the transmitter is equipped with
Nt antennas, and wants to transmit K independent data
streams, denoted by si(t), i = 1, . . . ,K, to the K respec-
tive receivers using transmit beamforming [1]. The transmit
signal is given by
∑K
i=1wisi(t), wherewi ∈ C
Nt is the beam-
forming vector for si(t). The received signal at receiver i can
be expressed as
yi(t) = h
H
i
(
K∑
i=1
wisi(t)
)
+ ni(t), (1)
where hi ∈ C
Nt is the channel vector of receiver i, and ni(t)
is the additive noise, with zero mean and variance σ2i > 0.

where ri > 0 is the radius of the ball {vi| ‖vi‖
2 ≤ r2i }
such that Pr(‖vi‖
2 ≤ r2i ) ≥ 1− ρi. We should mention that
Lemma 1 does not impose any specific statistical distribution
on vi. However, for the case of vi ∼ CN (0, INt) which is
of the main interest in this paper, 2‖vi‖
2 is a Chi-square
random variable with 2Nt degrees of freedom. Let ICDF(·)
be the inverse cumulative distribution function of 2‖vi‖
2.
Then one can show that the choice of the following radius
ri =
√
ICDF(1− ρi)
2
(11)
is sufficient to guarantee Pr(‖vi‖
2 ≤ r2i ) ≥ 1 − ρi for i =
1, . . . , K. Therefore, with the radii {ri}

is a conservative formulation for problem (5). It is interesting
to note from (12) that the probabilistic SINR constraints in
(5) have been replaced by an infinite number of deterministic
SINR constraints with spherically bounded uncertainty vec-
tors {vi}
K
i=1. Problem (12) is reminiscent of the worst-case
robust transmit beamforming problem considered in [2,3,7].
Different from [2,3,7] where the radii {ri}
K
i=1 are preassigned
system parameters, problem (12) now serves as a conserva-
tive formulation of the probabilistically-constrained problem
in (5), and the radii {ri}
K
i=1 are determined according to the
SINR outage probabilities [see (11)].
3.2 SDR for Problem (12)

handling problem (12) efficiently.
To illustrate this method, let us define Wi , wiw
H

i = 1, . . . ,K, and express (12) in terms of {Wi}
K
i=1 as

The semi-infinite constraints in (13b) can be recast as a fi-

cognitive radios.

where INt is the Nt ×Nt identity matrix.
By applying Lemma 2 to the constraints in (13b), one
can reformulate problem (13) as

where Ψi (W1, . . . ,WK , λi) is a linear matrix function de-
fined as

for i = 1, . . . ,K. One can see that problem (14) has a lin-
ear objective function and convex constraints except for the
nonconvex rank-one constraints in (14b). By removing these
nonconvex constraints, we obtain the following problem

as a relaxation to problem (12). The SDR problem (16) is a
convex SDP, and thus can be efficiently solved by CVX [9].
The SDR technique is in general an approximation
method in the sense that the optimum {Wi}
K
i=1 of problem
(16) may not have rank one. In that case, additional solution
approximation procedures to turn the optimum {Wi}
K
i=1
into a rank-one approximate solution of problem (12) is
needed [11]. Interestingly, our experience in simulations indi-
cates that the SDR problem (16) always yields rank-one so-
lutions, which means that SDR provides globally optimum
solutions of problem (12) for all the problem instances we
tried in simulations. Similar empirical observations are also
reported in [7] though a different robust beamforming prob-
lem is considered there. As a future direction, we will inves-
tigate the reason behind this intriguing finding. Here we are
more interested in using this practically appealing result to
help us resolve the conservative formulation (12).
3.3 Reducing the Level of Conservatism by Bisection
In the previous two subsections, we have shown that prob-
lem (12) with the radii {ri}
K
i=1 given by (11) is a conservative
formulation of the probabilistically-constrained problem (5),
and we have discussed that problem (12) may be efficiently
handled by SDR. It is noticed that problem (12) may be too
conservative in the sense that the associated optimum beam-
fomers {wi}
K
i=1 may yield an SINR satisfaction probability
much higher than 1− ρi. Since the level of conservatism of
problem (12) can be reduced by decreasing ri, this motivates409

has been considered in [2], where αi > 0 is the power weight
for BS i, and γik > 0 is the target SINR for MS k in cell
i. One can see from (3) that the Nc BSs jointly design their
beamforming vectors such that the weighted sum power of BSs
is minimized while each of the MSs can achieve the desired
SINR specification γik. It has been shown that problem (3)
can be reformulated as a convex second-order cone program
(SOCP) and can be efficiently solved via standard solvers, e.g.,
CVX [13].
In addition to problem (3), we also consider the con-
ventional single-cell beamforming (SBF) design that avoids
interfering neighboring cells by per-cell interference control

design conservatively treats the intercell interference upper
bound ξjik as fixed noise powers, in contrast to the MCBF
design in (3) where the Nc BSs collaborate to dynamically
control the intercell interference. It has been shown that the
SBF design is less power efficient than the MCBF design in (3)
[2]; however the SBF design can inherently be implemented
at each BS in a decentralized fashion.
III. PROPOSED ROBUST COORDINATED BEAMFORMING
A. Robust MCBF
The above formulations in (3) and (4) assume that the CPU
knows the exact CSI {hjik}. In the case that the CPU has
CSI with errors, the standard formulations in (3) and (4)
can no longer guarantee the desired SINR requirements. To
resolve this problem, we consider the worst-case robust design
formulation [6], [7].
Specifically, we model the true channel vector hjik as
hjik = h¯jik + ejik, (5)
for k = 1, . . . ,K, i, j = 1, . . . , Nc, where ejik ∈ CNt
represents the channel error vector. Moreover, let us consider
the elliptically bounded CSI errors, that is, each ejik satisfies
e

Problem (15) is a convex semidefinite program (SDP); hence
it can be efficiently solved [13].
Similarly, one can also consider a worst-case robust design
for the SBF design in (4), which is given by

for i = 1, . . . , Nc. By using similar techniques of S-procedure
and SDR, one can obtain an SDR problem for (16) which can
also be efficiently handled.
Since the SDR problem (15) is obtained by rank relaxation
of problem (3), the obtained optimal {Wik} of (15) may not
be of rank one. If the obtained optimal {Wik} happens to be
of rank one, i.e., Wik = wikwHik for all i, k, then {wik} is an
optimal solution of the original problem (8); otherwise addi-
tional solution approximation procedure is needed; see [11] for
the details. Interestingly, it is observed in our simulations that
problem (15) always yields rank-one optimal {Wik}, which
implies that an optimal solution of problem (8) can always
be obtained for the problem instances in our simulations. The
same rank-one optimality results are also observed for the SDR
problem of problem (16).
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, some simulation results are presented to
demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust MCBF
design. We consider a multicell system with three cells (Nc =
3) and two MSs (K = 2) in each cell. Assume that each BS
has five antennas (Nt = 5) and the inter-BS distance is 500
meters. In the simulations, we incorporate both large-scale and
small-scale channel fadings. Specifically, we follow the 3GPP
Long Term Evolution (LTE) channel model [14] defining the
true channel {hjik} as
hjik = 10
34.6+35log10(djik)
−20 · ψjik · ϕjik · (h¯jik + ejik), (17)
where the exponential term is due to the path loss depending
on the distance between the jth BS and the kth MS in cell i
(denoted by djik in meters), ψjik reflects the shadowing effect,
ϕjik represents the transmit-receive antenna gain, and the term
inside the parenthesis denotes the small-scale fading which is
composed of the channel estimate h¯jik and the CSI error ejik .
As seen from (17), it is assumed that the CPU can accurately
track the large-scale fading, and has CSI errors only in the
small-scale fading. In the simulations, the locations of the two
MSs in each cell are randomly determined (with distance to
the associated BS at least 35 meters, i.e., diik ≥ 35 for all i, k),
and thereby the distances to neighboring BSs, i.e., {djik}j 6=i,
can be determined. The shadowing coefficient ψjik follows the
log-normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation
equal to 8. The elements of the channel estimate {h¯jik}
are independent and identically distributed complex Gaussian
random variables with zero mean and unit variance. For
simplicity, we assume the spherically bounded CSI errors, i.e.,
Cjik = 1/ǫ
2
I, with the uncertainty radius ǫ set to 0.1. We also
assume that all the MSs have the same noise power equal to
σ2jik , σ
2 = −106.27 dBm [2], the same target SINRs, i.e.,
γjik , γ, and the same antenna gains, i.e., ϕjik = 5 dBi for
all j, i and k. We consider the total sum power minimization
problem for formulations in (3), (4), (8) and (16) by setting
αi = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , Nc. For problems (4) and (16), we
set all the intercell interference constraints {ξjik}j 6=i equal to
the noise power σ2 [4]. The robust formulations in (8) and
(16) are handled by the proposed SDR method described in
Sec. III-B, and CVX [13] is used to solve the associated SDPs.
In the first example, we investigate the minimal achievable
SINRs of the four formulations, namely, the non-robust SBF
design in (4), the non-robust MCBF design in (3) and their
robust counterparts in (16) and (8), in the presence of CSI
errors. We generated 5, 000 sets of channel estimates {h¯jik},
and, for each set of {h¯jik}, 100 sets of CSI errors {ejik}
satisfying ‖ejik‖2 ≤ ǫ2 were uniformly generated to evaluate
the achievable SINRs [in (2)] by the four formulations. Figure
2 shows the simulation results of the minimal achievable SINR
among all the MSs, by averaging over the channel estimates
for which the four formulations under test are all feasible. It
can be observed from this figure that both the robust designs
in (16) and (8) can guarantee the minimal SINR of MSs no
less than the target SINR γ; whereas the non-robust designs
can have SINR far below γ due to the CSI errors. In particular,
one can see from Fig. 2 that, for γ = 9 dB, the minimal SINR
achieved by non-robust MCBF is more than 10 dB lower than
that achieved by robust MCBF.
To show the power efficiency of MCBF, we present in Fig.
3 the corresponding average transmission powers of the four
methods under test. As a price for worst-case performance
guarantee, one can observe from this figure that the robust
designs in (16) and (8) require more transmission powers

ABSTRACT
Recently, robust transmit beamforming has drawn considerable at-
tention because it can provide guaranteed receiver performance in
the presence of channel state information (CSI) errors. Assuming
complex Gaussian distributed CSI errors, this paper investigates the
robust beamforming design problem that minimizes the transmission
power subject to probabilistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) constraints. The probabilistic SINR constraints in general
have no closed-form expression and are difficult to handle. Based
on a Bernstein-type inequality of complex Gaussian random vari-
ables, we propose a conservative formulation to the robust beam-
forming design problem. The semidefinite relaxation technique can
be applied to efficiently handle the proposed conservative formula-
tion. Simulation results show that, in comparison with the existing
methods, the proposed method is more power efficient and is able to
support higher target SINR values for receivers.

1. INTRODUCTION
Linear transmit beamforming has been recognized as a powerful
technique since it can achieve a large fraction of capacity with low
implementation complexity. Conventionally, it is assumed that the
transmitter has the perfect channel state information (CSI) of re-
ceivers, and the beamforming vectors are optimized such that the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements of re-
ceivers can be satisfied. In practical situations, however, the CSI
at the transmitter is inevitably subject to errors due to finite-energy
training and limited feedback. The presence of CSI errors will result
in receivers’ performance outage. Therefore, robust transmit beam-
forming designs that take the CSI errors into consideration [1, 2, 3, 4]
are of great importance.
In this paper, we assume that the CSI errors are complex Gaus-
sian distributed and study the stochastic robust beamforming design
problem. Specifically, we study the robust design formulation that
minimizes the transmission power subject to probabilistic SINR con-
straints on the receivers [2]. The probabilistic SINR constraints guar-
antee the receivers’ SINR requirements to be satisfied with a pre-
determined, high probability (i.e., a low outage probability). The

robust design problem is difficult to solve because the probabilistic
SINR constraints in general do not have close-form expression and
are not convex. To efficiently handle this problem, so-called con-
servative approaches that aim to obtain efficient approximate solu-
tions guaranteeing the probabilistic SINR requirements are proposed
[2, 4]. In particular, in [2], using robust optimization theory [5], it
has been shown that an approximate solution of the robust design
problem can be efficiently obtained by solving a convex semidefinite
program (SDP). In [4], a more efficient conservation formulation is
presented which also involves solving a convex SDP.
In this paper, we present a new conservative approach to the
probabilistic SINR constrained robust beamforming problem. The
idea of the proposed method is based on the observation that each of
the probabilistic SINR constraints is a probability inequality of the
quadratic form of complex Gaussian CSI errors. In [6], a Bernstein-
type inequality is presented which bounds the tail probability of
quadratic forms of real-valued Gaussian random variables. We ex-
tend this Bernstein-type inequality to complex Gaussian random vari-
ables, and, by utilizing this result, we propose a new conservative
formulation for the probabilistic SINR constrained robust beamform-
ing problem. The proposed conservative formulation is still a non-
convex optimization problem and difficult to handle. We show that
semidefinite relaxation (SDR), an convex optimization based ap-
proximation method, can be used, and the nonconvex conservative
formulation can be approximated by a convex conic problem, which
thereby can be efficiently solved. The presented simulation results
show that the proposed method is more power efficient and less con-
servative compared to the existing methods.
2. SIGNAL MODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
We consider a multiuser wireless system consisting of a multiple-
antenna transmitter and K single-antenna receivers. The transmitter,
equipped withNt antennas, wants to communicate with the receivers
using transmit beamforming. Let si(t) denote the information signal
for receiver i. The transmit signal is given by
∑K
i=1
wisi(t) where
wi ∈ C
Nt is the beamforming vector for si(t). The received signal
at receiver i is given by
yi(t) = h
H
i
(
K∑
k=1
wksk(t)
)
+ ni(t), (1)
where hi ∈ CNt denotes the channel vector of receiver i, and ni(t)
is the additive noise at receiver i. It is assumed that ni(t) has zero
mean and variance equal to σ2i > 0 for all i = 1, . . . , K. Assume
holds true if the following inequality is satisfied
Tr(Q)−
√
2δ
√
‖Q‖2F + 2‖u‖

(Q) ≥ c. (13)
Equation (13) thus serves as a conservative formulation for (12). It
is worthwhile to note that (13) can be equivalently represented by
Tr (Q)−

y ≥ 0, (14d)
where x, y ∈ R are introduced slack variables. By defining
δi , − ln(ρi), i = 1, . . . , K, (15)
and applying (14) to (9), we obtain the following problem

as a conservative formulation for problem (7), where vec(·) denotes
the column-by-column matrix vectorization.
Our derived conservative formulation (16) is desirable in yield-
ing closed-form expressions with the constraints. However, prob-
lem (16) is nonconvex, owing to the fact that Qi(w1, · · · ,wK),
ui(w1, · · · ,wK) and ci(w1, · · · ,wK) are indefinite quadratic in
(w1, · · · ,wK) [see (10)]. Next, we will handle this problem by
using the SDR technique [10].
3.2. Approximation by SDR
To apply SDR to the conservative formulation (16), we let Wi =
wiw
H

then constraining Wi to be positive semidefinite only, we obtain the

for i = 1, . . . ,K. Note that the constraints in (17b), (17c) and
(17d) are respectively a linear constraint, a convex second-order cone
(SOC) constraint and a convex PSD constraint. Hence problem (17)
is a convex conic problem and it can be efficiently solved by standard
solvers such as CVX [11].
The SDR problem (17) is in general an approximation to prob-
lem (16) because the associated optimal {Wi}Ki=1 may not be of
rank one. If the optimal {Wi}Ki=1 of problem (17) is of rank one,
i.e., Wi = wiwHi for all i, then {wi}Ki=1 is an optimal solution
to problem (16); otherwise additional solution approximation pro-
cedures to turn the optimum {Wi}Ki=1 into a rank-one approximate
solution of problem (16) is needed [10]. Fortunately and rather sur-
prisingly, it is found by simulations that problem (17) always yields
rank-one optimal {Wi}Ki=1. This implies that the globally optimal
solution of the conservation formulation (16) may be attained by
SDR, at least for all the problem instances we tested in simulations.
3.3. Reducing the Level of Conservatism by Bisection
Analogous to the methods presented in [2, 4], it is found that the
proposed conservative formulation (16) may yield beamforming so-
lutions that correspond to an SINR satisfaction probability [in (7b)]
much higher than 1 − ρi. According to (11), the SINR satisfaction
probability achieved by formulation (16) can be reduced by decreas-
ing the parameter δi. Hence the bisection method presented in [2, 4]
can be used to reduce the level of conservatism of problem (16).
To illustrate how this method works, let us assume that all the re-
ceivers have the same maximum tolerable SINR outage probability,
i.e., ρ , ρ1 = · · · = ρK . Thus we can let δ , δ1 = · · · = δK [see
(15)]. Given a δ, one can obtain a beamforming solution by solving
(16), and use the validation procedure in [5] to test if the associ-
ated probabilistic SINR constraints in (7b) are empirically satisfied
or not. If yes, the parameter δ can be reduced; otherwise it should
be increased. The procedure is repeated until a predefined stopping
criterion is met. Readers are referred to [2, 4] for further details.
4. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we present some simulation results to demonstrate the
performance of the proposed method. We consider the wireless sys-
tem as described in Section 2 with three antennas at the transmitter
and three receivers (Nt = K = 3). For simplicity, we consider in-
dependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian CSI
errors, i.e., Ci = ǫI for all i, and set ǫ = 0.002. The noise variances
of all receivers are set to 0.1 (σ21 = σ22 = σ23 = 0.1), and the outage
probabilities are set to 0.1 (ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ3 = 0.1), i.e., 90% satis-
faction probability. The target SINR values of all receivers are also
set the same, i.e., γ , γ1 = γ2 = γ3. We compare the proposed
conservative formulation in (16) with the method presented in [4]
and the Formulation I in [2]. The bisection technique mentioned in
Section 3.3 was also implemented for the three methods under test.
The parameter setting of this technique follows that in [4]. All the
three methods were implemented by CVX [11].
Since a less conservative method is more likely to be feasible,
in the first example, we examine the feasibility rates of the three
methods under test and their bisection counterparts. To this end,
500 sets of channel estimates {h¯i}3i=1 were generated according to
i.i.d. complex Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance. Figure
1 shows the simulation results of feasibility rate (%) versus target
SINR γ. As seen, the proposed conservative formulation in (16)

ABSTRACT
This paper considers weighted sum rate maximization of multiuser
multiple-input single-output interference channel (MISO-IFC) un-
der outage constraints. The outage-constrained weighted sum rate
maximization problem is a nonconvex optimization problem and is
difficult to solve. While it is possible to optimally deal with this
problem in an exhaustive search manner by finding all the Pareto-
optimal rate tuples in the (discretized) outage-constrained achiev-
able rate region, this approach, however, suffers from a prohibitive
computational complexity and is feasible only when the number of
transmitter-receive pairs is small. In this paper, we propose a convex
optimization based approximation method for efficiently handling
the outage-constrained weighted sum rate maximization problem.
The proposed approximation method consists of solving a sequence
of convex optimization problems, and thus can be efficiently imple-
mented by interior-point methods. Simulation results show that the
proposed method can yield near-optimal solutions.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recently, interference management for improving spectral efficiency
of wireless multiuser systems has been a research topic drawing
significant attention [1]. This paper considers the K-user multiple-
input single-output interference channel (MISO-IFC) where K
multi-antenna transmitters simultaneously communicate with K re-
spective single-antenna receivers over a common frequency band.
This MISO-IFC arises, for example, in multicell wireless systems
where each of the base stations is equipped with multiple antennas
and each mobile station has only one antenna. Under the assumption
that the transmitters have the perfect channel state information, and
that the receivers employ single-user detection, it has been shown
that transmit beamforming is an optimal transmission scheme to
attain the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region of MISO-
IFC [2]. The structure of the Pareto-optimal beamforming schemes
has also been studied in [3, 4]. A game-theoretic approach for
MISO-IFC has been presented in [5].
This paper assumes that the channel coefficients are block-faded,
and that the transmitters know only the statistical distribution of the
channels. Specifically, each channel is assumed to be circularly
symmetric complex Gaussian distributed, with a covariance matrix
known to the transmitters. Under limited delay constraints and due

2221-E-007-052-MY3 and NSC 98WFA0400537.
to channel fading, the receivers’ performance may suffer from out-
age. Assuming that the transmitters employ transmit beamforming,
the achievable rate region of MISO-IFC under outage constraints
on receivers’ performance has been investigated in [6]. While this
outage-constrained achievable rate region is not known analytically
so far, it has been shown that this region can be found numerically
using an exhaustive search method [6]. This method, unfortunately,
has a complexity that increases exponentially with K(K − 1), and
therefore is not feasible in practice.
In this paper, we investigate efficient approaches to achieving
Pareto-optimal beamforming solutions that maximize the achievable
weighted sum rate. To this end, we study the design formulation that
maximizes the weighted sum rate subject to outage constraints and
individual power constraints. Due to the nonconvextity of the out-
age constraints, solving the weighted sum rate maximization prob-
lem is a challenging task. To efficiently deal with this problem, we
propose a sequential convex approximation method. The proposed
approximation method is conservative in the sense that the obtained
approximate beamforming solutions are guaranteed to be feasible
and satisfy the outage constraints of the original problem. Since the
proposed method only involves solving convex optimization prob-
lems, it can be efficiently implemented by interior-point methods in
a polynomial-time complexity [7]. The presented simulation results
show that the proposed approximation method can provide near-
optimal performance and outperform the existing maximum-ratio
and zero-forcing transmission strategies.
2. SIGNAL MODEL AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
We consider the K-user MISO interference channel where each of
the transmitters has Nt antennas and all the receivers are equipped
with a single antenna. Assume that the transmitters employ transmit
beamforming to transmit information signals, and that the receivers
decode the information message using single-user detection which
treats the cross-link interference as noise. Let si(t) denote the in-
formation signal sent from transmitter i, and let wi ∈ CNt be the
associated beamforming vector. The received signal at receiver i is
given by
ri(t) = h
H
iiwisi(t) +
K∑
k=1,k 6=i
h
H
kiwksk(t) + ni(t), (1)
where hki ∈ CNt denotes the channel vector from transmitter k
to receiver i, and ni(t) is the additive noise of receiver i. The noise
ni(t) is assumed to be complex Gaussian distributed with zero mean
and variance σ2i > 0, i.e., ni(t) ∼ CN (0, σ2i ). Assuming that
where Kci , {1, . . . ,K}\{i}, and (7h) is due to (6c). Notice that
we have replaced the equalities in (6a) and (6b) with inequalities as
in (7c) to (7f). It is not difficult to verify that all the inequalities in
(7c) to (7f) would hold with equalities at the optimum; otherwise a
larger optimal weighted sum rate can always be obtained. Therefore,
problem (7) is equivalent to problem (5).
One can see that the objective function and most of the con-
straints of problem (7) are convex, except the constraints in (7c)
and (7e), and the nonconvex rank-one constraints in (7h). Let
({w¯i}Ki=1, {R¯i}Ki=1) be a feasible point of problem (2). Define
x¯ki , ln(w¯
H

y¯i , ln(2
R¯i − 1), (8b)
for i = 1, . . . ,K. Then {{x¯ki}k 6=i, y¯i}Ki=1 together with R¯i, x¯ii ,
ln(w¯Hi Qiiw¯i), W¯i , w¯iw¯
H
i and z¯i , ey¯i−x¯ii for i = 1, . . . ,K,
are feasible to problem (7). We aim to conservatively approximate
(7c) and (7e) with respective to the point {{x¯ki}k 6=i, y¯i}Ki=1. Since
exki is convex, its first-order approximation at x¯ki, i.e., ex¯ki(xki −
x¯ki + 1), is a global underestimate of exki . Hence it is sufficient to
achieve (7c) by considering the following linear constraint
Tr(WkQki) ≤ ex¯ki(xki − x¯ki + 1), (9)
for k ∈ Kci . To approximate (7e), we consider the following lower
bound for eyi + 1:(
eyi
θi1(y¯i)
)θi1(y¯i) ( 1
θi2(y¯i)
)θi2(y¯i)
≤ eyi + 1, (10)
where θi1(y¯i) = ey¯i/(ey¯i + 1) and θi2(y¯i) = 1/(ey¯i + 1). Equa-
tion (10) is obtained from the inequality of arithmetic and geometric
means. By (10), a sufficient condition for (7e) can be obtained as
(θi1(y¯i))
θi1(y¯i)(θi2(y¯i))
θi2(y¯i)e(ln 2)Ri−θi1(y¯i)yi ≤ 1, (11)
for i = 1, . . . , K, which are convex constraints. By replacing (7c)
and (7e) with (9) and (11), respectively, and by ignoring the noncon-
vex rank-one constraints in (7h), we obtain the following conserva-
tive formulation for problem (7):

where Θi(y¯i) , (θi1(y¯i))θi1(y¯i)(θi2(y¯i))θi2(y¯i). Problem (12) is a
convex optimization problem; it can be efficiently solved by standard
convex solvers such as CVX [7].
The idea of removing the nonconvex rank-one constraints of
{Wi}Ki=1 in (12) is known as semidefinite relaxation (SDR) in con-
vex optimization theory [9]. SDR is in general an approximation
because the optimal {Wi}Ki=1 of problem (12) may not be of rank
one. Surprisingly, it is found in our simulations that problem (12)
always yields rank-one optimal {Wi}Ki=1, i.e.,Wi = wi(wi)H for
all i, provided that Wi 6= 0. This implies that, for the problem
instances we tested in simulations, an approximate beamforming so-
lution to problem (2) can be directly obtained by decomposing the
optimal {Wi}Ki=1 of problem (12).
3.3. Sequential Conservative Approximations
The formulation (12) is obtained by conservatively approximating
problem (2) with respect to the feasible point ({w¯i}Ki=1, {R¯i}Ki=1)
[see (8)]. It is possible to further improve the approximation per-
formance by solving problem (12) iteratively with the optimal
({wi}Ki=1, {Ri}Ki=1) at the current iteration used as the feasible
point ({w¯i}Ki=1, {R¯i}Ki=1) for the next iteration. The proposed se-
quential approximation algorithm is summarized in the following
Algorithm 1:
Algorithm 1 Proposed sequential conservative approximation algo-
rithm for solving problem (2)
1: Input a feasible point ({w¯i}Ki=1, {R¯i}Ki=1) of problem (2), and
a solution accuracy δ > 0.
2: Obtain {{x¯ki}k 6=i, y¯i}Ki=1 by (8) and obtain θi1(y¯i) =
ey¯i/(ey¯i + 1) and θi2(y¯i) = 1/(ey¯i + 1) for i = 1, . . . , K.
3: Solve problem (12) to obtain the optimal beamforming matrices
{W?i }Ki=1 and rates {R?i }Ki=1.
4: Obtain w?i by decomposition of W?i = w?i (w?i )H for i =
1, . . . ,K.
5: Output the approximate beamforming solution (w?1 , . . . ,w?K)
and achievable rate tuple (R?1 , . . . , R?K) if |

∑K
i=1 αiR¯i < δ; otherwise update w¯i := w
?
i
and R¯i := R?i for all i, and go to Step 2.
The feasible point to initialize Algorithm 1 can be easily ob-
tained by some heuristic transmission strategies. For example, one
can obtain a feasible point ({w¯i}Ki=1, {R¯i}Ki=1) of problem (2)
through the simple maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) strategy. In
this strategy, the beamforming vectors {w¯i}Ki=1 are simply set to
w¯i =
√
Piqi where qi ∈ CNt , ‖qi‖ = 1, is the principal eigen-
vector of Qii for i = 1, . . . ,K. For the ith transmitter-receiver
pair, the associated i-outage achievable rate of MRT is given by the
maximum R¯i that satisfies the following inequality [see (5)]

Analogously, one can also obtain a feasible point of (2) by the zero-
forcing (ZF) transmission strategy, provided that Nt is sufficiently
large. In the next section, we present some simulation results to
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approximation algorithm.
4. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In the simulations, we consider the multiuser MISO-IFC as de-
scribed in Section 2. For simplicity, all the receivers are assumed
to have the same noise power, i.e., σ21 = · · · = σ2K , σ2, and all
the power constraints are set to one, i.e., P1 = · · · = PK = 1.
The channel covariance matricesQki were randomly generated. We
normalize the maximum eigenvalue of Qii, i.e., λmax(Qii), to one
for all i, and normalize λmax(Qki) to a value η ∈ (0, 1] for all
k ∈ Kci , i = 1, . . . ,K. The parameter η, thereby, represents the
relative cross-link interference level. If not mentioned specifically,
the ranks of Qki are all set to Nt. We consider the sum rate maxi-
mization problem by setting α1 = · · · = αK = 1 for problem (2),
