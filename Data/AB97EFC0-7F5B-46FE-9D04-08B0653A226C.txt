中文摘要 
本研究選擇台灣常見的四種濱海挺水性水生植物及兩種紅樹林：培地茅(Vetiveria 
zizanioides)、單葉鹹草(Cyperus malaccensis)、蘆葦(Phragmites communis)、香蒲(Typha 
angustifolia)、欖李(Lumnitzera racemosa)、海茄苳(Avicennia marina)等，評估其在含鹽分環
境中的耐受性，並探討種植此 6 種不同水生植物的人工溼地，進流廢水中的鹽度對溼地水
質淨化功能的影響。首先，在不同含鹽分的小規模溼地生態系統(microcosms)中，以批次更
換營養液的方式進行單一種植物的培養，結果顯示培地茅及香蒲在 0 及 5 g/L 的含鹽環境中
能持續生長，在 15 g/L 以上的水中則陸續出現葉片枯死及光合作用活性停止的結果。單葉
鹹草及蘆葦在 0~15 g/L 的鹽分環境中均可持續生長，但是植物生長速率及光合作用活性均
隨鹽分的增加而顯著降低，且無法生長於 25 g/L 的含鹽環境。欖李及海茄苳在 0~25 g/L 的
含鹽環境中雖然也觀察到鹽分濃度的提高顯著降低了植物生長速率及光合作用活性，不過
此兩種植物均能持續生長，在高鹽分逆境中表現最好的耐受性。另外，在試驗規模人工溼
地水質淨化實驗中發現，進流廢水之含鹽量顯著影響溼地植物的光合作用活性及生長，進
而影響人工溼地對氨氮的去除，在本研究最高試驗鹽分下(18.5 g/L)，上述六種水生植物中
只有紅樹林種的欖李及海茄苳光合作用活性最高且能持續生長，並維持最高的氨氮去除效
能。本研究結論人工溼地處理含鹽分廢水時，將可依據所處理廢水的實際鹽分範圍選擇適
合的挺水性水生植物。

Abstracts 
In this study, four species of common emergent macrophytes (Vetiveria zizanioides, Cyperus 
malaccensis, Phragmites communis, Typha angustifolia) and two native species of mangrove 
(Lumnitzera racemosa, Avicennia marina) were evaluated their salt tolerance when being planted 
in microcosms containing various levels of salinity (0, 5, 15 and 25 g/L). Also, several pilot-scale 
subsurface flow constructed (SSF) wetlands unplanted and planted with the six species of 
macrophytes above mentioned were installed to investigate the effects of salinity on ammonium 
removal performance of the wetlands as receiving a synthetic aquaculture wastewater with 
different salinity levels (5.3, 11.5, and 18.5 g/L). Results of the microcosm study show that 
Vetiveria and Typha grew well in microcosms with salinity up to 5 g/L, whereas they exhibited 
significant decreases in both relative growth rate and photosynthetic activity and could not 
survive eventually in salinity of 15 and 25 g/L. Phragmites and Cyperus grew properly in salinity 
ranging from 0 to 15 g/L, but they died off gradually in microcosm with salinity of 25 g/L. 
Lumnitzera and Avicennia remained healthy in all microcosms trials, still salinity had some 
negative effects on relative growth rate and photosynthetic activity of the macrophytes. In 
wastewater treatment study, salinity of influent also affected the relative growth rate and 
photosynthetic activity of the macrophytes, and thus ammonia removal performance of the 
constructed wetlands. Under low salinity (5.3 g/L) condition, all the planted wetlands showed 
higher ammonia removal than the unplanted wetland, in which Phragmites wetland had the 
highest ability. However, for treating high salinity (18.5 g/L) influent, Vetiveria and Typha 
wetlands had insignificant removal of influent ammonium (0.7 and -3.7%), and Phragmites and 
Cyperus wetlands exhibited performances (22.0 and 26.4%) similar to the unplanted wetland 
(26.5%), whereas Lumnitzera and Avicennia wetlands ranked the highest two (33.3 and 32.6%) 
among the wetlands.

一、前言 
(glycinebetaine)，有助於維持細胞內水分平衡(9)。 
泰國學者 Klomjek and Nitisoravut(10)曾評估八種當地的水生植物，包括：培地茅(vetiver 
grass)、香蒲(cattail)、莎草(sedge)、巴拉草(water grass)、kallar grass、Asia crabgrass、Amazon
及 salt meadow cordgrass 等，植種於小型 FWS 人工濕地中進流含高鹽分廢水，探討各種植
物的耐受性、相對生長速率及污染物去除效能。結果發現培地茅、香蒲對鹽度有最好的耐
受性及污染物去除效能。另外，泰國學者 Sananayuth et al(11)亦曾利用小規模 SSF 溼地(長 13 
m×寬 1.2 m)種植耐鹽性的紅樹林植物(mangrove fern)，處理養蝦漁塭的排廢水，在 HRT 為
1~3 天條件下操作，對污染物的去除效率可達：BOD5 91 %、SS 84%、TN 48%、TP 31%。 
台灣沿海地區也散佈有本土型的耐鹽性挺水植物(如蘆葦、雲林莞草、單葉鹹草等)及紅
樹林(海茄冬及欖李)。本文目的主要探討這些常見的水生植物生長於不同含鹽濃度營養液
時，鹽分對水生植物生長及光合作用活性的影響，以評估適用於處理不同含鹽廢水的濕地
植物。 
四、實驗方法 
1. 小規模溼地生態系統(microcosms)的批次培養 
研究系統為模擬表層下流動式（SSF，subsurface flow system）人工濕地所建立的小規
模溼地生態系統，溼地槽體為 PVC 製容器(長 29 cm × 寬 23 cm × 高 16 cm)，槽體裝滿粒
徑約 2.5cm 的礫石作為支撐水生植物生長的介質。選擇試驗的植物包括台灣常見的四種濱
海挺水性水生植物及兩種紅樹林：培地茅(Vetiveria zizanioides)、香蒲(Typha angustifolia)、
蘆葦(Phragmites communis)、單葉鹹草(Cyperus malaccensis)、欖李(Lumnitzera racemosa)、
海茄苳(Avicennia marina)等。前四種植物採自嘉南藥理科技大學人工濕地(處理校園污水)，
後兩種則為野生種採自台南市沿海溼地紅樹林區域，均採約 30 公分高的帶葉幼株，帶回實
驗室後先讓所有植株浸於淡水營養液(含 TN 5 mg/l 及 TP 2 mg/l)約 7 天，以適應新環境生
長。再將幼株編號吸乾外表水分並秤重(W1)，隨後栽植於槽體礫石表層下 10 cm 處，每槽
體種植相同植物 3 株。每種植物槽體分成四個試驗組，不同試驗組注入不同含鹽濃度(0、
10、20、25 g/L)的營養液進行植物培養，該營養液為上述淡水培養液添加不同量粗鹽配製
而成。同種植物及相同含鹽濃度的試驗，都使用兩重複槽體(共 6 株植栽)進行。每隔 5 天，
將槽內培養液洩出並注入新鮮營養液(約 4 公升)，以分批(batch)方式更新營養液。由於採用
六種植物、四種含鹽濃度及兩重複試驗，本研究總計使用 48 個小規模溼地生態系統。實驗
系統設於教學大樓頂樓陽台，日照充足、空曠處。 
2. 試驗規模人工溼地水質淨化 
本計畫共設立 7 組試驗規模之表面下流人工溼地(subsurface flow system constructed 
wetlands)，每一組 SSF 溼地均為長 70 cm、寬 50 cm、高 60cm 的塑膠製水槽，槽內填滿
粒徑介於 3~5 cm 的礫石作為介質，以溢流管控制水深約 50 cm，礫石床空隙率約為 0.45，
溼地之有效容積約為 0.079 m3。其中 6 組溼地分別種植培地茅(Vetiveria zizanioides)、香蒲
(Typha angustifolia)、蘆葦(Phragmites communis)、單葉鹹草(Cyperus malaccensis)、欖李
(Lumnitzera racemosa)、海茄苳(Avicennia marina)，並有另一組為不種植物的對照組溼地。
每組溼地採用連續進流方式，並在出流口設置採樣點。 
溼地進流水主要成份為地下水中加入 NH4Cl 與 Na2HPO4 以模擬養殖池水的主要污染
物，NH4-N 與 PO4-P 目標濃度分別為 5 mg N/l 與 2 mg P/l。合成廢水配置方式為在一 4.5 m3
的加藥水塔配置完成後，再分別以重力方式入流於各系統。 
人工溼地自 2005 年 11 月開始操作，試驗期間總計分為三個操作階段接續進行。此三
個操作階段中，各個溼地組的進流水均盡可能控制在流量約 0.075 m3/d，使水力負荷約為
組相同；而每一種植物的光合作用活性與生長速率值與 0 g/L 添加試驗組比較，均只有些微
的下降(p>0.05)(圖 1~3)。在為期 25 天的培養試驗中，六種水生植物均能持續生長，顯示對
5 g/L 的鹽分均具有耐受性。 
在鹽分添加 15 g/L 的實驗組中，六種植物在培養初期(第 3 天)即發現光合作用活性顯
著(p<0.01)低於 5 g/L 鹽分添加的實驗組(圖 1 及 2)。尤其培地茅及香蒲在培養到第 8 天後光
合作用活性即開始明顯的下降，葉片逐漸枯黃，直到培養第 18 天後，葉片已普遍枯黃，已
測不到光合作用的 Yield 及 ETR 值(圖 1 及 2)，此結果顯示培地茅及香蒲在 15 g/L 的鹽分環
境下僅能短期耐受生長(約 8 天)，其 25 天的相對生長速率評估分別為淡水條件之相對生長
速率的 39%及 24%(圖 3)，若持續在此逆境下，最終植物則受傷害枯死。反觀蘆葦、單葉鹹
草、欖李及海茄苳，光合作用活性顯著低於淡水試驗組(ETR 值分別為淡水(0 g/L)試驗組的
0.73、0.70、0.81 及 0.71)顯示鹽分逆境對植物生理的顯著抑制，然而在此逆境下這些植物
直到試驗結束後仍能持續生長 (圖 1 及 2)，亦能觀察到新的葉片及芽形成，25 天的相對生
長速率評估分別為淡水條件之生長速率的 0.88、0.74、0.74 及 0.57。此結果顯示這些植物
對 15 g/L 的鹽分逆境具有耐受性，光合作用活性及生長速率的排序大體上呈：蘆葦＞單葉
鹹草、欖李＞海茄苳之趨勢。 
當鹽分添加濃度增加到 25 g/L 時，鹽分逆境更高，培地茅及香蒲葉片更快速的枯黃，
在初期培養(第 3 天)時光合作用活性僅表現為淡水試驗組的 0.26 與 0.28，在第 13 天以後幾
乎已測不到 Yield 及 ETR 值(圖 1 及 2)，培養期間無法觀測到其植體增加生長趨勢(圖 3)。
蘆葦及單葉鹹草受鹽分的生長抑制亦較 15 g/L 的鹽分添加還顯著，隨著培養過程在高鹽分
逆境下，葉子亦逐漸枯黃、無新芽生成、Yield 及 ETR 亦逐漸下降，分別在第 23 及 18 天
時已偵測不到光合作用的進行，25 天的生長速率評估分別為淡水條件之生長速率的 0.29 及
0.16。而欖李及海茄苳，一開始之光合作用活性雖也受鹽份逆境抑制，ETR 分別為淡水試
驗組的 0.65 及 0.66，然而隨著培養過程仍能持續生長(圖 1 及 2)，亦能觀察到新的葉片及芽
形成，25 天的生長速率評估分別為淡水條件之生長速率的 0.50 及 0.57，顯見欖李及海茄苳
對 25 g/L 鹽份的環境有相當良好的耐受性，並可達持續的生長。 
2. 試驗規模系統水質淨化試驗 
Stage 1 期間(2005 年 11 月~2006 年 4 月)的進流水中雖然不外加鹽，但是因為試驗場址
的地下水屬於半鹹水(brackish water)，因此水中鹽度介於 3.8~6.5 g/L、電導度介於 7.53~11.34 
mS/cm。由於試驗期間處於冬季及春季，各人工溼地組之水溫介於 19.9~28.5℃，隨著操作
過程水溫逐漸增加。6 種水生植物均生長良好，各種水生植物之 Yield 及 ETR 值在 11 月~2
月間均維持較低的範圍，2 月下旬後因日照強度增強，使得葉片光合作用活性有隨著操作
時程有顯著增加的趨勢(圖 4)。比較 4 月份各植物的 ETR 值，可發現欖李、香蒲、蘆葦＞
海茄苳、單葉鹹草、培地茅。。由水質分析結果顯示，各溼地組出流水之氨氮濃度均顯著
低於(p＜0.05)進流水濃度；各個有種植植物的溼地組氨氮平均去除效率介於 37.4~50.7%，
均顯著高於(p<0.05)無種植植物溼地的 28.6%。其中，種植蘆葦及香蒲的溼地去除效率最高，
些微高於培地茅、單葉鹹草及欖李，海茄苳的表現稍差(表 1)。 
Stage 2 期間(2006 年 5 月~7 月)在進流水中添加粗鹽約 12 g/L，實測鹽度在 10.3~12.8 
g/L，電導度增加到 18.22~19.64 mS/cm。試驗期間處於夏季，各人工溼地組之水溫變化不
大介於 26.0~30.0℃。各溼地組中水生植物的光合作用活性(Yield 及 ETR)均立即下降，欖李
及蘆葦隨即回升到穩定的 ETR 值(圖 4)。比較各植物的 ETR 值，可發現欖李＞蘆葦、香蒲
＞海茄苳、單葉鹹草、培地茅。各個有種植植物的溼地組氨氮平均去除效率介於
29.8~44.8%，均高於無種植植物溼地的 26.2%。，單葉鹹草、海茄苳及控制組在 Stage 2 的
氨氮去除效率與 Stage 1 的氨氮去除結果相比較下無明顯差異 (p＞0.05)；然而，培地茅、

as a cost-effective and feasible method (Shrimali and Singh, 2001). However, there is a limitation in 
biological denitrification because surface water or groundwater normally lacks for organic carbon, which is 
essential as an electron donor for booming denitrification, thus requiring the addition of external carbon 
source. 
Many researchers have reported that constructed wetlands can be an alternative for nitrate removal from 
water and wastewater via the mechanisms of microbial denitrification and direct uptake by plants and 
microbes (van Oostrom and Russel, 1994; Horne, 1995; Baker, 1998; Robins et al., 2000). Wetland 
denitrification occurs in anoxic zones of sediments beneath an aerobic water surface layer or in anoxic 
microsites of a biofilm attached to plant tissue or substrata (IWA, 2000). Bacteria in constructed wetland tend 
to use plant productivity, either from biomass litter or root release, as the source of organic carbon to fuel 
denitrification (Ingersoll and Baker, 1998). Thus, nitrate can be effectively removed without addition of 
external carbon source as long as macrophytes are present in wetlands (Lin et al., 2003; Bastviken et al., 
2005). 
In engineering practice, the design of constructed wetlands is often carried out using simple input/output 
models, in which many complex treatment mechanisms are lumped together, resulting in one overall 
biological reaction rate coefficient (Kadlec and Knight, 1996; IWA, 2000). The effect of nitrate concentration 
on the nitrate removal rate has been described as either a zero order (Bachand, 1996) or first-order reaction 
(Gale et al., 1993; Spieles and Mitsch, 2000; Fleming-Singer and Horne, 2006). However, the nitrate 
removal rate coefficients have been assessed frequently based on influent-effluent data; less frequently on 
internal longitudinal transect data. On the other hand, wetland design can be also achieved by using directly 
the important design parameters such as hydraulic loading rate (HLR) and mass loading rate (USEPA, 2000). 
The effect of HLR or nitrate loading rate (NLR) on nitrate removal has received little attention and only on 
the FWS wetlands (Bachand, 1996; Robins et al., 2000; Spieles and Mitsch, 2000).
Constructed wetlands are divided according to water flow pattern into two categories, i.e. free water 
surface (FWS) and subsurface flow (SF) wetlands. The FWS wetland should have an advantage in nitrate 
removal, since the plant litter is always in the water and susceptible to more rapid decomposition as 
compared to the SF wetland, where the plant litter rests on top of the media (Reed et al., 1995). Conversely, 
the SF wetland has more surface area for attached growth of denitrifying bacteria and provides more anoxic 
environment to perform denitrification than the FWS wetland. Most nitrate treatment wetlands reported in 
literature are classified as the category of FWS wetlands (van Oostrom and Russell, 1994; Horne, 1995; 
Bachand and Horne, 2000; Reilly et al., 2000; Spieles and Mitsch, 2000; Lane et al., 2003; Fleming-Singer 
and Horne, 2006). To date, there is still a very limited study aiming at the performance of an SF wetland in 
nitrate removal and denitrification when receiving water with high concentration of nitrate. The knowledge
of nitrate treatment performance of both FWS and SSF constructed wetlands may be of importance for the 
designers so as to select an appropriate type or design a best combination of different types of wetlands for 
the nitrate removal purpose.
In the present study, pilot-scale FWS and SF constructed wetlands were established to receive the 
nitrate-contaminated groundwater. The objectives of the study were to (1) compare the discrepancy in nitrate 
longitudinal transect data, water samples were also taken inside the wetlands weekly at the central of the 
lateral direction and every one meter along the flow direction. Water samples were analyzed for NH4-N, 
NO2-N, NO3-N and PO4-P contents by an ion chromatograph (DX-120, Dionex) according to the method in a 
previous study (Lin et al., 2002). Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), total 
Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were measured according to the Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). Total organic 
carbon (TOC) was determined using a TOC analyzer (TOC 5000A, Shimadzu, Japan). Dissolved oxygen 
content (DO), pH and ORP were measured in situ when sampling the water sample.
Statistical analysis
The concentrations of the constituents in the effluents generally stabilized after 1-2 weeks once the trial 
was changed. Only steady-state data were used to test the significant difference and calculate the mean and 
standard deviation values for various trials of both wetlands. Tests for significant difference in water quality 
between influent and effluent of the wetlands, and water quality among the six trials were determined by 
paired t-tests at a significance level of 0.05 (OriginLab, 1996). Difference in treatment performance between 
the FWS wetland and SSF wetland were determined by one-way ANOVA.
Kinetic model
It is well recognized that removal of basically all pollutants of interest in constructed wetlands can be 
described using first-order plug flow kinetic model (Kadlec and Knight, 1996; IWA, 2000). Although its 
inadequacy has been noted (Kadlec, 2000), it is still the most appropriate design model for describing 
pollutant removal with regards to present knowledge (IWA, 2000). This model is given as follows when
omitting the background pollutant concentration:
where C is the concentration in wetland (mg/L), Ci the influent concentration (mg/L), Ce effluent 
concentration (mg/L), q (=Q/A) the hydraulic loading rate (m/d), Q the average rate of inflow and outflow
(m3/d), A the wetland area (m2), k 1 the first-order areal rate constant (m/d), k 1,V the first-order volumetric 
rate constant (1/d), y (=x/L) the fractional distance through the wetland (m), L the wetland length (m), x the 
distance from the inlet (m), t is the nominal detention time (d), •the void fraction of wetland bed, and h is 
the water depth (m).
Conversely, Bachand (1996) proposed a zero-order kinetic model to describe the performance of nitrate 
removal in FWS macrocosms, such that:

FWS wetland had significantly higher (p<0.05) concentration of TOC in effluent for all trials. This 
discrepancy demonstrates that the FWS wetland did provide more organic matter to water column than the 
SF wetland as previously mentioned (Reed et al., 1996). 
DO content from influent to effluent was always increased in the FWS wetland; it contrarily decreased in 
the SF wetland (Tables 2 and 3). Effluent DOs in the FWS wetland were usually higher than 2.0 mg/L, 
whereas the SF wetland always caused effluent DOs less than 1.0 mg/L. These results imply that the SF 
wetland provide a more anoxic condition because of limited exposure of water to environment, which should 
be a benefit in denitrification for nitrate removal, while an aerobic condition was present in the FWS wetland, 
which probably hindered denitrification occurring in water column.
There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in TSS from influent to effluent of the FWS wetland during 
Trials 1 and 2 (Table 2) because of the presence of plant detritus and active growth of algae under low HLR 
(•0.03 m/d) or long hydraulic detention time (•6 d). This TSS increase did not occur when HLR was greater 
than 0.06 m/d during Trials 4 to 6 due to higher dilution rate. Because of absence of algae growth and 
presence of fewer amount of plant litter, the SF wetland usually exhibited less effluent TSS level than the 
FWS wetland (Table 3). A significant increase (p<0.05) in pH from influent to effluent was observed only in 
the FWS wetland during Trials 1 and 2 (Tables 2 and 3), demonstrating the active growth of algae that 
theoretically leads to increase of pH in water column. 
Temperature is typically a critical factor affecting the wetland’s performance in removing the major 
pollutants of interest (IWA, 2000). However, the effect of temperature was neglected in this study because 
water temperature in both wetlands measured in the study period from middle spring to middle fall were 
usually higher than 26• and the average temperature in each trial spanned only a narrow range (Tables 2 
and 3).
Effects of HLR or NLR on nitrate removal
The effects of HLR on effluent nitrate concentration, nitrate removal efficiency and nitrate removal rate 
for the constructed wetland are clearly shown in Figures 4 to 6, respectively. Nitrate concentrations in
wetland effluent always satisfied drinking water standard (•10 NO3-N/L) and nitrate removal efficiencies 
remained high (>85%) when HLR did not exceed 0.04 m/d for both FWS and SSF wetlands (Figures 4 and 
5). Average effluent nitrate increased and average removal efficiency decreased with the increase of HLR. 
Areal nitrate removal rates for both wetlands increased proportionally to the HLR when HLR was not greater 
than 0.04 m/d and gradually reached to maximum values (Figure 6). The maximum removal rates, occurred 
at HLR of 0.12 and 0.07 m/d, were 0.91 and 1.161 g N/m2/d for the FWS and SF wetland, respectively.
Nitrate removal rate considerably decreased when HLR continuously increased to 0.25 m/d. The relationship 
between nitrate removal rate and nitrate loading rate (Figures 7) illustrated the similar trend as that between 
nitrate removal rate and HLR. These two trends indicate that there was sufficient organic carbon in wetlands 
flow resistance due to high void fraction in wetland bed (••0.9). 
Nitrate removal rate constants 
For the SF wetland, first-order kinetic model (equation (1), with correlation coefficients R2= 0.88~0.98) 
was more sufficient to correlate the internal longitudinal transect nitrate data than zero-order kinetic model 
(equation (4), with correlation coefficients R2= 0.53~0.98). Thus, the parameter k1 for the SF wetland was 
determined by least squares fitting to be 0.027~0.135 m/d (0.15~0.75 d-1)(Figure 10). Although the 
longitudinal transect data for the FWS wetland followed the first-order plug flow model less sufficiently (R2= 
0.52~0.65) than the SF wetland, k1 was determined to be 0.021~0.093 m/d (0.12~0.52 d-1) for comparison. 
The k 1s were also calculated by using equation (2) and influent-effluent data in each trial, resulting in 
0.024~0.138 m/d for the FWS wetland and 0.029~0.137 m/d for the SF wetland (Figure 11), which were 
slightly higher than the values obtained from the longitudinal transect data. 
The k1 values obtained in this study falls near the middle of the range of literature values. Kedlec and 
Knight (1996) reported a typical k1 value of 0.164 m/d for the FWS and 0.136 m/d for the SF wetland at 20
•. Spieles and Mitsch (2000) estimated a general k1,V of 0.4 d-1 for nitrate removal in a FWS wetland 
receiving river water. In a survey of a large-scale FWS constructed wetland for nitrate removal, 
Fleming-Singer and Horne (2006) reported the k1 values ranging 0.084~0.130 m/d. 
Kadlec et al. (2000) has reported hydraulic loading would strongly affect the first-order BOD removal 
rate constants of constructed wetlands, in which k1 increased with increasing HLRs. However, this study 
demonstrates that k1 for nitrate removal, determined either from longitudinal transect data or influent-effluent 
data, tends to decrease with increasing HLRs (Figures 10 and 11). This contrast result may be due to increase 
of nitrate loading rate caused by increasing HLR reducing the organic carbon to nitrate ratio that further 
decreased the denitrification rate in wetlands. Hume et al. (2002) has found a strong relationship between the 
first-order nitrate removal rate constants and the soluble carbohydrate to nitrate ratio in a wetland microcosm 
study. They suggested low plant productivity or high nitrate loading would promote a lower denitrification 
rate. 
Conclusions
The effect of hydraulic loading rate on performance of the FWS and SF constructed wetlands in nitrate 
removal was investigated by sequential operation of the wetlands at different rates of inflow. The following 
conclusions were obtained:
1. Nitrate removal efficiencies remained high (>85%) and effluent nitrate concentrations always satisfied 
drinking water standard (•10 NO3-N/L) when HLR did not exceed 0.04 m/d for both FWS and SSF 
wetlands. As HLR was greater than 0.4 m/d, effluent nitrate significantly increased and removal 
efficiency considerably decreased with the increase of HLR.

as a cost-effective and feasible method (Shrimali and Singh, 2001). However, there is a limitation in 
biological denitrification because surface water or groundwater normally lacks for organic carbon, which is 
essential as an electron donor for booming denitrification, thus requiring the addition of external carbon 
source. 
Many researchers have reported that constructed wetlands can be an alternative for nitrate removal from 
water and wastewater via the mechanisms of microbial denitrification and direct uptake by plants and 
microbes (van Oostrom and Russel, 1994; Horne, 1995; Baker, 1998; Robins et al., 2000). Wetland 
denitrification occurs in anoxic zones of sediments beneath an aerobic water surface layer or in anoxic 
microsites of a biofilm attached to plant tissue or substrata (IWA, 2000). Bacteria in constructed wetland tend 
to use plant productivity, either from biomass litter or root release, as the source of organic carbon to fuel 
denitrification (Ingersoll and Baker, 1998). Thus, nitrate can be effectively removed without addition of 
external carbon source as long as macrophytes are present in wetlands (Lin et al., 2003; Bastviken et al., 
2005). 
In engineering practice, the design of constructed wetlands is often carried out using simple input/output 
models, in which many complex treatment mechanisms are lumped together, resulting in one overall 
biological reaction rate coefficient (Kadlec and Knight, 1996; IWA, 2000). The effect of nitrate concentration 
on the nitrate removal rate has been described as either a zero order (Bachand, 1996) or first-order reaction 
(Gale et al., 1993; Spieles and Mitsch, 2000; Fleming-Singer and Horne, 2006). However, the nitrate 
removal rate coefficients have been assessed frequently based on influent-effluent data; less frequently on 
internal longitudinal transect data. On the other hand, wetland design can be also achieved by using directly 
the important design parameters such as hydraulic loading rate (HLR) and mass loading rate (USEPA, 2000). 
The effect of HLR or nitrate loading rate (NLR) on nitrate removal has received little attention and only on 
the FWS wetlands (Bachand, 1996; Robins et al., 2000; Spieles and Mitsch, 2000).
Constructed wetlands are divided according to water flow pattern into two categories, i.e. free water 
surface (FWS) and subsurface flow (SF) wetlands. The FWS wetland should have an advantage in nitrate 
removal, since the plant litter is always in the water and susceptible to more rapid decomposition as 
compared to the SF wetland, where the plant litter rests on top of the media (Reed et al., 1995). Conversely, 
the SF wetland has more surface area for attached growth of denitrifying bacteria and provides more anoxic 
environment to perform denitrification than the FWS wetland. Most nitrate treatment wetlands reported in 
literature are classified as the category of FWS wetlands (van Oostrom and Russell, 1994; Horne, 1995; 
Bachand and Horne, 2000; Reilly et al., 2000; Spieles and Mitsch, 2000; Lane et al., 2003; Fleming-Singer 
and Horne, 2006). To date, there is still a very limited study aiming at the performance of an SF wetland in 
nitrate removal and denitrification when receiving water with high concentration of nitrate. The knowledge
of nitrate treatment performance of both FWS and SSF constructed wetlands may be of importance for the 
designers so as to select an appropriate type or design a best combination of different types of wetlands for 
the nitrate removal purpose.
In the present study, pilot-scale FWS and SF constructed wetlands were established to receive the 
nitrate-contaminated groundwater. The objectives of the study were to (1) compare the discrepancy in nitrate 
longitudinal transect data, water samples were also taken inside the wetlands weekly at the central of the 
lateral direction and every one meter along the flow direction. Water samples were analyzed for NH4-N, 
NO2-N, NO3-N and PO4-P contents by an ion chromatograph (DX-120, Dionex) according to the method in a 
previous study (Lin et al., 2002). Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), total 
Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were measured according to the Standard Methods (APHA, 1995). Total organic 
carbon (TOC) was determined using a TOC analyzer (TOC 5000A, Shimadzu, Japan). Dissolved oxygen 
content (DO), pH and ORP were measured in situ when sampling the water sample.
Statistical analysis
The concentrations of the constituents in the effluents generally stabilized after 1-2 weeks once the trial 
was changed. Only steady-state data were used to test the significant difference and calculate the mean and 
standard deviation values for various trials of both wetlands. Tests for significant difference in water quality 
between influent and effluent of the wetlands, and water quality among the six trials were determined by 
paired t-tests at a significance level of 0.05 (OriginLab, 1996). Difference in treatment performance between 
the FWS wetland and SSF wetland were determined by one-way ANOVA.
Kinetic model
It is well recognized that removal of basically all pollutants of interest in constructed wetlands can be 
described using first-order plug flow kinetic model (Kadlec and Knight, 1996; IWA, 2000). Although its 
inadequacy has been noted (Kadlec, 2000), it is still the most appropriate design model for describing 
pollutant removal with regards to present knowledge (IWA, 2000). This model is given as follows when
omitting the background pollutant concentration:
where C is the concentration in wetland (mg/L), Ci the influent concentration (mg/L), Ce effluent 
concentration (mg/L), q (=Q/A) the hydraulic loading rate (m/d), Q the average rate of inflow and outflow
(m3/d), A the wetland area (m2), k 1 the first-order areal rate constant (m/d), k 1,V the first-order volumetric 
rate constant (1/d), y (=x/L) the fractional distance through the wetland (m), L the wetland length (m), x the 
distance from the inlet (m), t is the nominal detention time (d), •the void fraction of wetland bed, and h is 
the water depth (m).
Conversely, Bachand (1996) proposed a zero-order kinetic model to describe the performance of nitrate 
removal in FWS macrocosms, such that:

FWS wetland had significantly higher (p<0.05) concentration of TOC in effluent for all trials. This 
discrepancy demonstrates that the FWS wetland did provide more organic matter to water column than the 
SF wetland as previously mentioned (Reed et al., 1996). 
DO content from influent to effluent was always increased in the FWS wetland; it contrarily decreased in 
the SF wetland (Tables 2 and 3). Effluent DOs in the FWS wetland were usually higher than 2.0 mg/L, 
whereas the SF wetland always caused effluent DOs less than 1.0 mg/L. These results imply that the SF 
wetland provide a more anoxic condition because of limited exposure of water to environment, which should 
be a benefit in denitrification for nitrate removal, while an aerobic condition was present in the FWS wetland, 
which probably hindered denitrification occurring in water column.
There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in TSS from influent to effluent of the FWS wetland during 
Trials 1 and 2 (Table 2) because of the presence of plant detritus and active growth of algae under low HLR 
(•0.03 m/d) or long hydraulic detention time (•6 d). This TSS increase did not occur when HLR was greater 
than 0.06 m/d during Trials 4 to 6 due to higher dilution rate. Because of absence of algae growth and 
presence of fewer amount of plant litter, the SF wetland usually exhibited less effluent TSS level than the 
FWS wetland (Table 3). A significant increase (p<0.05) in pH from influent to effluent was observed only in 
the FWS wetland during Trials 1 and 2 (Tables 2 and 3), demonstrating the active growth of algae that 
theoretically leads to increase of pH in water column. 
Temperature is typically a critical factor affecting the wetland’s performance in removing the major 
pollutants of interest (IWA, 2000). However, the effect of temperature was neglected in this study because 
water temperature in both wetlands measured in the study period from middle spring to middle fall were 
usually higher than 26• and the average temperature in each trial spanned only a narrow range (Tables 2 
and 3).
Effects of HLR or NLR on nitrate removal
The effects of HLR on effluent nitrate concentration, nitrate removal efficiency and nitrate removal rate 
for the constructed wetland are clearly shown in Figures 4 to 6, respectively. Nitrate concentrations in
wetland effluent always satisfied drinking water standard (•10 NO3-N/L) and nitrate removal efficiencies 
remained high (>85%) when HLR did not exceed 0.04 m/d for both FWS and SSF wetlands (Figures 4 and 
5). Average effluent nitrate increased and average removal efficiency decreased with the increase of HLR. 
Areal nitrate removal rates for both wetlands increased proportionally to the HLR when HLR was not greater 
than 0.04 m/d and gradually reached to maximum values (Figure 6). The maximum removal rates, occurred 
at HLR of 0.12 and 0.07 m/d, were 0.91 and 1.161 g N/m2/d for the FWS and SF wetland, respectively.
Nitrate removal rate considerably decreased when HLR continuously increased to 0.25 m/d. The relationship 
between nitrate removal rate and nitrate loading rate (Figures 7) illustrated the similar trend as that between 
nitrate removal rate and HLR. These two trends indicate that there was sufficient organic carbon in wetlands 
flow resistance due to high void fraction in wetland bed (••0.9). 
Nitrate removal rate constants 
For the SF wetland, first-order kinetic model (equation (1), with correlation coefficients R2= 0.88~0.98) 
was more sufficient to correlate the internal longitudinal transect nitrate data than zero-order kinetic model 
(equation (4), with correlation coefficients R2= 0.53~0.98). Thus, the parameter k1 for the SF wetland was 
determined by least squares fitting to be 0.027~0.135 m/d (0.15~0.75 d-1)(Figure 10). Although the 
longitudinal transect data for the FWS wetland followed the first-order plug flow model less sufficiently (R2= 
0.52~0.65) than the SF wetland, k1 was determined to be 0.021~0.093 m/d (0.12~0.52 d-1) for comparison. 
The k 1s were also calculated by using equation (2) and influent-effluent data in each trial, resulting in 
0.024~0.138 m/d for the FWS wetland and 0.029~0.137 m/d for the SF wetland (Figure 11), which were 
slightly higher than the values obtained from the longitudinal transect data. 
The k1 values obtained in this study falls near the middle of the range of literature values. Kedlec and 
Knight (1996) reported a typical k1 value of 0.164 m/d for the FWS and 0.136 m/d for the SF wetland at 20
•. Spieles and Mitsch (2000) estimated a general k1,V of 0.4 d-1 for nitrate removal in a FWS wetland 
receiving river water. In a survey of a large-scale FWS constructed wetland for nitrate removal, 
Fleming-Singer and Horne (2006) reported the k1 values ranging 0.084~0.130 m/d. 
Kadlec et al. (2000) has reported hydraulic loading would strongly affect the first-order BOD removal 
rate constants of constructed wetlands, in which k1 increased with increasing HLRs. However, this study 
demonstrates that k1 for nitrate removal, determined either from longitudinal transect data or influent-effluent 
data, tends to decrease with increasing HLRs (Figures 10 and 11). This contrast result may be due to increase 
of nitrate loading rate caused by increasing HLR reducing the organic carbon to nitrate ratio that further 
decreased the denitrification rate in wetlands. Hume et al. (2002) has found a strong relationship between the 
first-order nitrate removal rate constants and the soluble carbohydrate to nitrate ratio in a wetland microcosm 
study. They suggested low plant productivity or high nitrate loading would promote a lower denitrification 
rate. 
Conclusions
The effect of hydraulic loading rate on performance of the FWS and SF constructed wetlands in nitrate 
removal was investigated by sequential operation of the wetlands at different rates of inflow. The following 
conclusions were obtained:
1. Nitrate removal efficiencies remained high (>85%) and effluent nitrate concentrations always satisfied 
drinking water standard (•10 NO3-N/L) when HLR did not exceed 0.04 m/d for both FWS and SSF 
wetlands. As HLR was greater than 0.4 m/d, effluent nitrate significantly increased and removal 
efficiency considerably decreased with the increase of HLR.
