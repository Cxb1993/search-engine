2研究摘要：1
目前醫療臨床及化妝品市場上所使用的皮膚美白藥效成分，大多具有生理毒性，2
在使用上有其限制。而全球皮膚美白醫療及化妝品市場又極其龐大，因此各大醫學研究3
單位與化妝品公司莫不積極從事新一代皮膚美白藥效成份的研究開發。4
然而，每一個新藥開發必經相關的人體生理吸收與代謝、誘導突變性、致癌性、5
急毒性等安全性試驗，所需的費用與時程之成本十分龐大，甚至高於當初新藥的有效性6
試驗開發成本。有鑑於此，本實驗室在開發新一代的皮膚美白藥效成份時，我們思索如7
何能夠避開龐大成本需求且十分費時的人體安全性測試。故此，我們大膽嘗試舊藥新用8
的研發策略。經過了近一年的計畫初期試驗。我們在一般醫院所使用的學名藥當中，挑9
選了 201 個作為本計畫初期試驗的標的藥物。利用老鼠 B16 黑色素腫瘤細胞與斑馬魚10
活體胚胎進行新一代的皮膚美白藥效成份的篩選研究。經過三次獨立，各三重複的實驗11
驗證，我們在測試的 201 個藥物中，發現了 Homochlorcyclizine (HC)具有成為新一代的12
皮膚美白藥效成份的潛力。13
HC 是臨床上非常常用的一般抗組織胺藥劑（Antihistamine），在 1965 年首先於日14
本上市，一直使用至今，主要用來治療過敏以及感冒所引起的不適症狀。HC 在使用上15
並無明顯的副作用，亦無對其使用者有限制。此外，醫藥級 HC 原料原廠價格為每公16
斤台幣 1.5 萬元，符合一般皮膚美白藥效原料低價條件。本計劃之前期實驗已證實 HC17
在體外抑制細胞黑色素生成之活性比目前臨床上使用的熊果素要強 100 倍以上，並具18
有在斑馬魚胚胎活體的美白效能。更重要的是，HC 已是衛生署核准的原料藥，並且至19
今無相關皮膚美白或黑色素生成抑制的論文發表與專利保護。總結來看，各方面證據20
均指出 HC 適合於新一代皮膚美白藥效成分的開發。21
基於上述前期試驗結果及考量往後醫療及產業應用發展性，我們提出本二年期之22
研究計畫，期待往後 2 年的時間，能夠繼續進行 HC 對黑色素生成之抑制機轉研究及23
HC 在活體的皮膚美白有效性試驗。第一年計畫以老鼠 B16 黑色素腫瘤細胞為材料，24
在經過 HC 處理後，以西方點墨法（western blotting）、免疫沈澱法（immuno-precipitation）25
與反轉錄連鎖聚合反應法（RT-PCR）來分別偵測細胞中與黑色素生成及調控相關之蛋26
白質及其 RNA 的表現量、蛋白質磷酸化訊號傳遞的影響以及相關之蛋白質被蛋白質體27
（Proteasome）降解的影響，進而解開 HC 抑制黑色素生成之機轉。第二年計畫則著重28
於 HC 在活體的皮膚美白有效性試驗。我們計畫先利用斑馬魚作為活體模型，詳細試29
驗 HC 對斑馬魚胚胎的黑色素合成量、胚胎中 TYR 活性及胚胎存活率等影響。接著，30
進一步利用皮膚滲透儀搭配高壓液相層析法，偵測不同濃度 HC 在化妝品基劑中對豬31
皮或鼠皮的經皮吸收程度，以確定最佳經皮吸收條件。最後利用老鼠活體，以皮膚分32
光色差計，測定 HC 在老鼠活體的皮膚美白療效。期待透過本研究計畫可以開發出具33
有實用價值且可以更快速並節省新藥開發成本的皮膚美白藥效原料。34
4的論文發表與專利保護。總結來看，各方面證據均指出 HC 適合開發成為新一代皮膚1
美白的藥效成分。另一方面，本計畫前期試驗中所篩選的 201 個學名藥當中，共有 112
個屬於抗組織胺藥劑，包括：Cetirizine (Cetin®)、Cold (Cold®)、Cyprohetadine、3
Dexchlorpheniramine、Fexofenadine (Allegra®)、Hydroxyzine (Vistaril®)、Loratadine、4
Mequitazine、Oxatomide、Pseudoephedrine 及 HC。經過三次獨立，各三重複的實驗驗5
證，這些抗組織胺藥劑中僅有 HC 對黑色素腫瘤細胞及斑馬魚胚胎黑色素生成具有抑6
制能力，顯現出 HC 在抑制黑色素方面的獨特性。詳細的抑制機轉有待進一步研究得7
知。8
基於上述前期試驗結果及考量往後醫療及產業應用發展性，我們提出本二年期之9

6The histamine receptor H1 antagonist homochlorcyclizine (HC) has been widely used1
as an antihistamine agent for the treatment of allergies. However, the effect of HC on skin2
pigmentation is not known. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of HC3
on melanogenesis in mouse B16 melanoma cells. Our results showed that HC inhibited4
melanogenesis in either-melanocyte stimulating hormone (-MSH)- or5
3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin (IBMX)-stimulated B16 cells in a dose-dependent manner with6
an IC50 value of 4.6M. Despite the strong inhibition of melanogenesis by HC, it was7
surprisingly found that HC did not reduce either cellular or melanosomal tyrosinase activity8
in-MSH-stimulated B16 cells. In addition, HC also did not directly inhibit either murine or9
mushroom tyrosinase activity in the cell-free system. Moreover, western blotting and10
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses respectively confirmed11
that HC did not downregulate levels of tyrosinase protein and its mRNA in12
-MSH-stimulated B16 cells. These results clearly demonstrated that HC inhibits13
melanogenesis of B16 cells by a mechanism other than reduction of the cellular tyrosinase14
activity. From the present study, HC was proven to be a good candidate as a skin-whitening15
agent for treatment of skin hyperpigmentation, and this generic drug might be suitable for use16
in combination with other depigmenting agents due to its unique inhibition mechanism.17

INTRODUCTION21
22
Skin pigmentation is produced by dermal melanocytes. Melanogenesis has been defined23
as the entire process leading to the formation of dark macromolecular pigments, i.e., melanin,24
which are formed by a combination of enzymatically catalyzed and chemical reactions25
(Chang, 2009). Melanogenesis is initiated in melanosomes, the special organelles of26
melanocytes, with the first step of L-tyrosine oxidation to L-dopa27
(L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and then to dopaquinone, which is catalyzed by tyrosinase.28

Materials4
Homochlorcyclizine was a kind gift from Eisai Co. (Taipei, Taiwan). Hydroxyzine was5
obtained from MP Biomedicals Co. (Irvine, CA, USA). Cetirizine was bought from Tocris6
Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Cimetidine and ranitidine were purchased from Tokyo Chemical7
Industry Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Arbutin, mushroom tyrosinase (2870 U/mg),8
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), Triton X-100,9
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), L-dopa, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), trypsin/EDTA,10
synthetic melanin, IBMX, and-MSH were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis,11
MO, USA). Anti-tyrosinase antibodies (#62914) and protease inhibitor cocktail were obtained12
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Anti--actin antibodies (#3662) were purchased from13
Bio Vision Inc. (Irvine, CA, USA). All other chemicals were obtained from Tokyo Chemical14
Industry Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and were of analytic reagent grade. Solutions were prepared15
using mini-Q (Millipore Corp.) ultrapure water.16
17
Cell cultures and drug treatments18
Mouse B16 melanoma cells (4A5) were obtained from the Bioresources Collection and19
Research Center (BCRC, Food Industry Research and Development Institute, Hsinchu,20
Taiwan, ROC). The cels were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) 21
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified, CO2-controlled22
(5%) incubator. The cells were seeded at an appropriate cell density in a 24-well or a 6-well23
plate. After 1 d of incubation, the cells were treated with various concentrations of the drugs24
in the absence or presence of a stimulation agent (10 nM of-MSH or 100M of IBMX) for25
another 2 d. Thereafter, the cells were harvested and used for various assays.26
27
Measurements of cell viability28
10
at 37 °C for 15 min, following which the dopachrome formation was monitored by measuring1
absorbance at a wavelength of 475 nm. One unit of tyrosinase activity is defined as the total2
enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1mole of dopachrome in 1 min. The amount of3
dopachrome in the reaction was calculated using the Lambert-Beer Law while the molar4
extinction coefficient of dopachrome is 3600 M-1·cm-1 (Neeley et al., 2009). The specific5
tyrosinase activity was normalized with protein content in the reaction.6
To prepare a melanosome-enriched fraction, untreated or HC-treated cells were7
harvested, washed with PBS twice and lysed in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 1 mM8
PMSF at 4 °C in the absence of detergent with 50 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The9
lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells,10
and the resultant supernatant was centrifuged again at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to11
obtain a melanosome-enriched pellet. The pellet was then resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mM12
sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 1 mM PMSF and used as the enzyme source. The13
kinetics of melanosome-enriched tyrosinase activity was conducted in a 1-ml reaction14
mixture containing 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 2.5 mM of L-dopa, and 70g of the15
supernatant protein from the melanosome-enriched enzyme source. Dopachrome formation of16
the reaction mixture was kinetically monitored by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of17
475 nm every min at 37 °C.18
19
Measurements of cell-free tyrosinase activity20
The crude enzyme source of solubilized tyrosinase was prepared as described above,21
with the excdeption that untreated cells were used in this measurement. To determine the22
inhibitory effect of HC toward cell-free tyrosinase activity, the reaction mixture contained 5023
mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 2.5 mM of L-dopa, the tested concentration of the drug, and24
500g of the supernatant protein with a total volume of 1 ml of crude tyrosinase. After25
incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, dopachrome formation was monitored by measuring the26
absorbance at 475 nm. The relative tyrosinase activity was obtained by dividing the enzyme27
activity of the reaction mixture containing a drug by that without drugs.28

cycle at 72 °C using a PCR Sprint Thermal Cycler HBSP02110 (Thermo Fisher Scientific1
Inc., IL, USA). The oligonucleotides primers for mouse tyrosinase (forward,2
5′-GGCCAGCTTTCAGGCAGAGGT-3′; reverse, 5′-TGGTGCTTCATGGGCAAAATC-3′)3
and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal control4
(forward, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; reverse,5
5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′) were used. The PCR products were electrophoresed at6
100 V for 40 min on a 2% agarose gel in TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the signal7
intensity of each band was quantified and normalized as description in the western blot8
analysis.9
10
Statistical analysis11
All the data in the present study were obtained as averages of experiments that were12
performed in triplicate and are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed13
by the Student’s t test using simple controls in the MTT and cell-free tyrosinase inhibitory14
assays or using positive controls with-MSH stimulation in the other assays. A value of p <15
0.05 was considered to be statically significant.16

RESUTLS18
19
Effect of HC on cell viability20
Before investigating the effect of HC on melanogenesis of mouse B16 melanoma cells,21
the concentration range of the compound that is nontoxic to the cells should be determined.22
Cell viability of drug-treated cells was determined by the MTT method. Arbutin was used as23
the control in the present study. As illustrated in Fig. 1, it is clear that 4M HC does not exert24
any cytotoxicity to mouse B16 melanoma cells, and the cytotoxic IC50 value of HC toward25
B16 cells is determined to be 14.5M. In order to ignore the cytotoxic effect of HC, we used26
HC concentration of up to 4M in the depigmenting experiments of the present study.27
28
14
The cellular tyrosinase activity in the crude extract was significantly increased after1
stimulation by-MSH. Surprisingly, however, the increased enzyme activity in2
-MSH-stimulated cells was not reduced by HC treatment (Fig. 5), although HC treatment3
could reduce the melanin content of-MSH-stimulated cells to a level similar to that of the4
non-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 to 4). In an advanced approach, after stimulation by-MSH, we5
isolated melanosomes from either untreated or HC-treated cells and performed a kinetic study6
of tyrosinase activity in the 2 melanosome-enriched fractions. The result is shown in Fig. 6.7
Consistent with the result from the inhibition study with the crude cellular tyrosinase, the8
melanosomal tyrosinase activity in the HC-treated cells was not reduced as comparing to that9
in the untreated cells.10
In addition, we also investigated whether HC could directly inhibit tyrosinase activity in11
cell-free systems. Both crude murine tyrosinase and commercially purified mushroom12
tyrosinase were used. The results are shown in Fig. 7. It is very clear that HC did not directly13
inhibit enzyme activity of both murine (Fig. 7A) and mushroom (Fig. 7B) tyrosinase in the14
cell-free systems. In contrast, kojic acid, which is a well-known tyrosinase inhibitor, showed15
significant inhibition of both the enzyme activities.16
17
Effect of HC on tyrosinase protein and its mRNA levels18
To confirm that HC did not reduce the cellular tyrosinase activity in advance, we19
conducted western blotting and RT-PCR to verify levels of tyrosinase protein and its mRNA20
in the untreated and HC-treated cells. The results are shown in Fig. 8 and 9. After stimulation21
by-MSH, both tyrosinase protein (Lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 8A and 8B) and its mRNA (Lanes22
1 and 2 in Fig. 9A and 9B) were significantly increased. However, the increased levels of23
both tyrosinase protein (Lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 8A and 8B) and its mRNA (Lanes 2 and 4 in24
Fig. 9A and 9B) in the-MSH-stimulated cells were not downregulated by HC treatment,25
although HC has been proven to reduce the melanogenesis in-MSH-stimulated cells to the26
level of that in non-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 to 4).27
28
16
cellular tyrosinase activity (Fig. 5), melanosomal tyrosinase activity (Fig. 6), cell-free murine1
(Fig. 7A), or mushroom (Fig. 7B) tyrosinase activity. The results suggested that HC strongly2
inhibited melanogenesis of B16 cells without affecting tyrosinase activity. In advance,3
western blotting and RT-PCR analyses respectively confirmed that tyrosinase protein (Fig. 8)4
and its mRNA (Fig. 9) levels in the HC-treated cells were not downregulated. The results5
strongly correlated with those of the above inhibition experiments of cellular and6
melanosomal tyrosinase activity. Therefore, we concluded that HC inhibits melanogenesis not7
via reduction of tyrosinase activity in-MSH-stimulated mouse B16 melanoma cells.8
Over the last few years, there has been remarkable progress in the knowledge of9
melanocyte biology and the processes underlying melanin synthesis, opening new paths in10
the pharmacologic approach to the development of newly melanogenesis inhibitors. In11
addition to the inhibition of the catalytic activity of tyrosinase, other approaches include12
inhibition of tyrosinase mRNA transcription, aberration of tyrosinase glycosylation and13
maturation, acceleration of tyrosinase degradation, and blocking of hormone-induced14
melanogenesis signal pathway. Accordingly, a huge number of depigmenting or whitening15
agents developed by these approaches has been successfully identified. However, all the16
approaches described above for the discovered melanogenesis inhibitors involve reducing17
tyrosinase activity in the tested cells because of the key role of this enzyme in melanogenesis.18
In the present study, we demonstrated that the mechanism of melanogenesis inhibition by HC19
is not by reducing the tyrosinase activity in B16 cells. To our knowledge, this is the first20
report to discover a strong melanogenesis inhibitor with a mechanism other than reduction of21
tyrosinase activity in the depigmenting cells.22
Recently, Schallreuter et al. proposed a new hypothesis that the 3-enzyme cascade23
(L-phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)-L-tyrosine hydroxylase (THI)-tyrosinase) is involved in24
the initiation of melanogenesis (Fig. 10, Schallreuter et al., 2008). In that hypothesis, PAH25
metabolizes L-phenylalanine, whose uptake occurs through the large amino acid transporter,26
to L-tyrosine, which is the substrate for THI. The resultant L-dopa, which is produced by the27
action of THI on L-tyrosine, activates tyrosinase by reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I) on the enzyme28
