Abstract: Cardenas-Barron [Applied Mathematical Modelling 34 (2010) 1684-1688] indicates that there are 
several functions in which the arithmetic-geometric mean method (AGM) does not give the minimum. This 
paper presents another situation to reveal that the AGM inequality to locate the optimal solution may be 
invalid for Teng et al. [Applied Mathematical Modelling 33 (2009) 4388-4396], Teng and Goyal 
[International Journal of Systems Science 40 (2009) 1095-1098] and Hsieh et al. [Production Planning and 
Control 19(6) (2008) 601-604]. So, the main purpose of this paper adopts the calculus approach not only to 
overcome shortcomings of the arithmetic-geometric mean method of Teng et al. (2009), Teng and Goyal 
(2009) and Hsieh et al. (2008) but also to develop the complete solution procedures for them.

1. Introduction 
Facing an optimal problem of an objective 
function ( )f x  defined on , the standard 
approach is to use calculus to explore the functional 
behaviors (such as continuous, increasing, 
decreasing, convex or concave) of 
0x 
( )f x  to locate 
the optimal solution. In fact, calculus can provide a 
powerful tool for analyzing the fine structure of a 
graph, especially in identifying those points where 
the character of the graph changes. We can locate 
local maximum points, local minimum points, and 
inflection points; we can determine precisely where 
the graph is increasing or where it is convex. So, 
sketching the graph will be an effective technique 
to determine the optimal solution. The basic 
procedures of sketching the graph can be found in 
Varberg et al. [(2007), page 181]. In general, these 
procedures will be rather complex and difficult for 
people that lack knowledge of calculus since they 
involve the first- and second-order derivatives. 
Hence, some researchers frequently adopt (1) the 
complete perfect square method, or (2) the 
arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method to avoid 
using derivatives to simplify the solution 
procedures.  
(I) About the complete perfect square method: 
Grubbstrom and Erdem (1999), 
Cardenas-Barron (2001), Ronald et al. 
(2004), and Chang et al. (2005) successfully 
use the complete perfect square method to 
get the optimal solutions without derivatives. 
Although Huang and Huang (2008) adopt 
the complete perfect square method to 
obtain the optimal solutions without 
derivatives, Chung (2010) corrects their 
shortcomings to present accurate proofs for 
them. 
(II) About the arithmetic-geometric mean 
(AGM) method: Cardenas-Barron (2010) 
indicates that possibly, Oh and Hwang 
(2006) and Castello and Goldman (2006) 
are first to use AGM inequality in
