英文摘要 
We investigate and compare the effects of 
silicon thicknesses on interface characteristics in 
strained-Si nMOSFET fabricated on SiGe virtual 
substrate. Ge out-diffusion effect and slight 
strain relaxation in Si-cap layer are observed 
with capacitance-voltage measurements. The 
low-frequency noise characteristics were used to 
further investigate the interface transport 
mechanisms and show the same tendency. 
Moreover, experimental results show that the 
unified model, i.e. carrier number fluctuation 
model, including correlated mobility fluctuation 
is more suitable to interpret the mechanism of 1/f 
noise in strained-Si devices. Carrier number 
fluctuation dominates the 1/f noise in weak 
inversion, but the mobility fluctuation 
contributes to strong inversion. 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
Strain engineering is currently a promising 
way to overcome the limitations imposed by 
standard silicon technology [1]. Employing 
strained-Si on SiGe virtual substrate (VS) is one 
of the methods to achieve this goal [2]. The 
enhanced electron mobility in strained-Si layers 
under biaxial tensile strain principally results 
from reduced intervalley phonon scattering and a 
reduction in the in-plane effective mass. 
However, a possibly unforeseen occurrence is 
that the low-frequency (LF) noise of strained-Si 
nMOSFETs may also be improved compared 
with the 1/f noise of n-channel transistors 
fabricated on SiGe VS. On the other hand, 1/f 
noise is a viable characterization tool that can be 
used in the study of interfacial physics and has 
been extensively applied to unstrained Si 
nMOSFET. Recently, strained-Si MOSFETs 
have been reported significantly dependence of 
the 1/f noise characteristics on gate oxide 
formation due to Ge out-diffusion [3] and 
threading dislocation densities [4], the growth 
conditions for strained-relaxed buffer (SRB) 
[5-6], and channel width [7]. Simoen et al. even 
report reduced LF noise in strained-Si devices 
fabricated on thin SiGe SRB layers [6]. However, 
the noise model in strained-Si devices is still 
unclear and need to be further investigated. In 
this paper, the impact of Si-cap thickness on the 
1/f noise characteristics is studied. It is found 
that the carrier number fluctuation is dominative 
in strained-Si devices with the Si-cap below 
critical thickness. While the Si-cap becomes 
partial relaxation, correlated mobility fluctuation

)Fig. 4 shows the quasi-static frequency (100 
kHz) capacitance–voltage (C-V) curves 
measurements on long-channel strained-Si 
nMOSFETs (length = 10 μm and width = 10 
μm). There is no difference in physical oxide 
thickness due to the same accumulation 
capacitance (EOT ~ 2.6 nm). Large C-V shift 
and serious C-V distortion observed in a 
10-nm-thick Si-cap devices are attributed to the 
fact that more amount of the Ge diffuse up into 
the SiO2, which results in negative oxide trapped 
charge and high interface trap density (Dit) at 
SiO2/Si interface. As the Si-cap thickness is 
increased to above 15 nm, the phenomenon of 
C-V shift and distortion was vastly improved. 
Moreover, the mobility extracted from split C-V 
measurements on similar devices at a drain bias 
VDS = 100 mV, as shown in Fig. 5. The tensile 
strain at a vertical effective field of 1 MV/cm in 
the 15nm and 20nm Si-cap layer enhance the 
mobility by about 270% and 330% (as compared 
to the 10nm) in the long-channel transistors, 
respectively. The Dit was analyzed from the C-V 
and G-V characteristics using Hill’s method [8] 
for different strained-Si thickness in the relaxed 
Si0.72Ge0.28 layer.

different strained-Si thickness layer. 
It is found that the trap density of devices 
with 15nm and 20nm-thick strained-Si layer is 
higher than that of Bulk Si (2×1012 eV-1 cm-2) 
but have an acceptable level of about ~ 3.9 × 
1012 eV-1 cm-2, while poor oxide interface quality 
of 2.43×1013 eV-1cm-2 was observed for 
strained-Si device with 10-nm-thickness cap 
layer. This result is consistent with frequency 
dispersion clearly observed in the C–V 
characteristics. For further investigation of the 
interface characteristics, on-wafer 1/f noise 
measurements have been performed in the linear 
regime (drain voltage VDS = 0.1 V), changing the 
gate voltage VGS from weak to strong inversion. 
The equivalent normalized input gate voltage 
noises (SVg) as function of gate overdrive 
(VGS-VTH) are shown in Fig. 6. The strained-Si 
nMOSFET with 10-nm-thick Si-cap exhibits the 
worst noise levels than other devices. A poor 1/f 
noise characteristic is attributed to the fact that 
the Si-cap is insufficient to restrain the Ge 
up-diffusion effect. The result is confirmed by 
the previous observation of strong Ge 
out-diffusion impact on different gate oxide 
processes [4]. Based on the carrier number 
fluctuation model originated by McWhorter [9] 
for the nMOSFET, 1/f noise is highly sensitive

It is found that the Si cap thickness plays an 
important role to characterize the interface 
quality. Ge out-diffusion effect in Si-cap layer is 
responsible for the degradation of 1/f noise. On 
the other hand, Si-cap undergoes stronger tensile 
strain for higher Si cap thickness, the correlated 
mobility fluctuation term in the modified carrier 
number fluctuation model is more dominated for 
the 1/f noise, especially for strong inversion.
