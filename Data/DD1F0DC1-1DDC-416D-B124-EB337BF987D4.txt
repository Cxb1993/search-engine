Abstract:   
In Type-I QPM, group-velocity mismatch and phase-mismatch have been eliminated so that 
the Kerr effect becomes an indispensable factor for broadband wavelength conversion 
system. In this work, the conversion efficiency of SHG saturated at ~32 % due to Kerr effect. 
Theoretical analyses verify the experiment results and also explain the corresponding mechanism. In 
addition, dispersion causes an asynchronous phase among different wavelength components, 
where between fundamental wave band and second-harmonic wave band. Such 
asynchronous phase causes relative asynchronous couplings and asynchronous wave mixing 
so that low the conversion efficiency.

tough task to engineer for ultra-short pulse system. One compromising approach is to sacrifice the conversion 
efficiency and use of an extremely short crystal to avoid temporal walk-off between the FM wave and SH 
wave. A tightly focused and high intensity FM wave is often used to get some conversion efficiency in a 
short crystal. Nevertheless, the misgiving of high intensity causes material damage usually limits the device’s 
energy throughput. Several nonlinear optics technologies were proposed to investigate group-velocity match 
g =0 between FM and SH waves [4-8]. Particularly, Type-I MgO-doped PPLN (MgO:PPLN) can change 
the group-velocity matched wavelength by turning MgO-doping rate [9]. That implies the Type-I MgO-
doped PPLN is able to simultaneously achieve both phase-match k=0 and group-velocity match g = 0 at 
interested wavelength for a broadband wavelength conversion system [9-12].  
 
The cascaded SHG+DFG or cascaded SFG+DFG, can induce effective third-order nonlinearity )3(eff  
[13-16]. However, such induced effective )3(eff  was caused by cascaded second-order nonlinearity (2) :(2) 
and was different from an intrinsic material third-order nonlinearity (3). Effective )3(eff  reduced bandwidth of 
FM wave, but intrinsic (3) could increase bandwidth of FM wave, where represented in section 5. In 1998, J. 
Y. Zhang et. al. investigated SHG of ultra-short pulse in non-QPM crystal BBO and LBO [17]. Since those 
BBO and LBO were simultaneously with 2, g, k and Kerr effect. Therefore, J. Y. Zhang et. al. 
concluded that Kerr nonlinearity had very little effect on the output of SHG. In 2003, N. E. Yu et. al. studied 
the ultra-short pulse SHG in Type-I MgO:PPLN and found the measurement SHG output was lower than 
theoretic value [18]. N. E. Yu et. al. predicted such conversion efficiency downgrade due to high-order 
nonlinearity. However, N. E. Yu et. al. didn’t further analysis the influence of Kerr effect on Type-I QPM 
crystal. In fact, the group-velocity mismatch g and phase-mismatch k have been eliminated in Type-I 
QPM crystal, therefore the Kerr effect become an indispensable factor for broadband SHG wavelength 
conversion system. 
 
In this paper, a 3 cm-long Type-I MgO:PPLN is used to perform ultra-short SHG pulse, by launching a 
wavelength 1564.3 nm and pulse duration 0.58 ps pulse from a mode-locked fiber laser. For achieving high 
SHG energy throughput, we increase initial launched peak power from 2475W to 22708W. The experimental 
results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the SHG conversion efficiency decrease when initial 
launched peak power > 15708W due to material intrinsic third-order nonlinearity (3). In addition, we also 
explain the mechanism of SHG efficiency downgrade by Kerr effect, in Type-I MgO:PPLN. This work is 
contributive, to develop dispersion compensation and Kerr management technologies, for a broadband 
wavelength conversion system in the future study.

3. CW cascaded SHG+DFG and cascaded SFG+DFG 
For investigating the cascaded SHG+DFG and cascaded SFG+DFG process within a broadband wavelength 
conversion system, we used two ultra-narrow band light source to demonstrate the nonlinear wave-mixing 
mechanism in crystal. Figure 3 is a continuous wave (CW) wavelength conversion system using a Type-I 
MgO:PPLN. In this system, a CW pump wave was generated by DFB laser where the central wavelength was 
1566 nm. Another CW pump 1 wave with central wavelength 1562 nm was generated by external cavity 
diode lasers (ECL). Following the polarization controller (PC), the combined pump wave and pump 1 wave 
were amplified by erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), and then were launched into a Type-I MgO:PPLN 
crystal.  
Figure 4 are the output, measurement spectra of the waves where was measured at 1.56 m band and at 
0.78 m band, respectively.  The high plot of Fig.4 is the output spectrum of 1.56 m band. We find that a 
comb spectrum include central wavelength 1558 nm, 1562 nm, 1564 nm, 1566 nm and 1570 nm occurred in 
output. The low plot of Fig.4 is the output spectrum of 0.78 m band. Similarly, a comb spectrum that 
includes central wavelength 779 nm, 781 nm, 782 nm, 783 nm and 785 nm were sawed in output. Such comb 
spectrums generated due to the cascaded SFG+DFG and cascaded SHG+DFG process in Type-I MgO:PPLN 
crystal. However, those experimental results predict that a similar cascaded SFG+DFG and cascaded 
SHG+DFG process will occur in a broadband wavelength conversion system.

Figure 6 shows the output, measurement results of our broadband wavelength conversion system. In 
Fig.6, the high plot is the average SHG output power versus average input fundamental (FM) power. The low 
plot is the SHG conversion efficiency versus initial launched FM ultra-short pulse peak power. The highest 
conversion efficiency was measured about 32%, and the conversion efficiency saturated when the FM ultra-
short pulse peak power was increased beyond 15708 W. The saturation of the SHG efficiency at high input 
power is due to phase modulation by Kerr effect. Although the Type-I nonlinear coefficient of d31 was about 
one fifth of d33 in Type-0 lithium niobate, the measured SHG efficiency was comparable to that using a 10 
mm long Type-0 MgO:PPLN [21]. The input and output end-facet reflection has been considered when we 
calculated SHG conversion efficiency.

Figure 7 displays the experimental spectra of FM pulse before and after Type-I MgO:PPLN. The initial 
launched FM peak power is 3617W.  The FWHM bandwidth of FM pulse increased from input 8.3 nm to 
output 9 nm due to the mixing of cascaded second-order nonlinearity and intrinsic third-order 
low plot of Fig.7, we assume our initial pulse is with frequency chirp parameter Co=0.556 to generate a 8.3 
nm non-transform-limited pulse, where is represented by dot line. However, such assumed frequency chirp, 
may be caused by optical grating compressor or CPA system, is reasonable. Generally speaking, the optical 
pulse is always a hyperbolic-second form when it generates from a mode-locked laser. Therefore, the form of 
our theoretical initial launched FM pulse is set to

temperature distribution in crystal also contributes some k in both end sections. Beside that, the beam-
width vary versus propagation distance X in the low plot of Fig.9, is also necessary, because the size of 
beam-width will change the coupling coefficient  in equation (7) and coefficient  in equation (8). In fact, 
the simulation results of SHG conversion efficiency can’t match to the measurement data of Fig.6, if we 
neglect the influence of k and beam-width varying along the propagation distance where show in Fig.9.

Figure 10 show the theoretical and normalized output spectra of FM wave versus different crystal length 
L, for considering alone (2) and both (2) + (3) effects, respectively. The dot line (I) is the input spectrum of 
FM wave. From the high plot of Fig.10, we find that the FWHM band-width decreases when the crystal 
length L increases, if we consider alone (2) effect. However, such theoretical calculation doesn’t match to 
experimental result in Fig.7 (input 8.3 nm and output 9 nm). In the low plot of Fig.10, we can see that the 
FWHM band-width increases versus crystal length L increasing, when we consider both (2) and (3) effect in 
coupled mode equations. That imply (3) effect is an indispensable factor for Type-I QPM crystal. 
 
propagation distance. In equation (6), the second right braces of equal sign represent the Kerr effect which 
includes self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation effects. Those phase modulation effects cause 
phase difference varying, between FM and SHG wave, and lowing the SHG conversion efficiency. Figure 12 
shows the phase difference o between FM and SHG wave versus propagation distance for different peak 
power. The o is set to 15.782,o3.1564,oo   . The high plot of Fig.12 consider alone (2) effect, 
and the low plot of Fig.12 consider both (2) + (3) effect. From the low plot of Fig.12, we can find that Kerr 
effect cause phase difference o, between FM and SHG wave, quickly varying along the propagation 
distance. Averagely, such o quickly rotates along the propagation distance which lows the conversion 
efficiency and saturates the SHG output power.

Figure 13 represent the SHG conversion efficiency versus propagation distance, for CW narrow band 
case and broadband ultra-short pulse case. The lines (a) and (b) only consider (2) effect and lines (c) and (d) 
consider both (2) + (3) effect. The simulation results demonstrate that  (3) effect reduce the conversion 
efficiency when peak power beyond 15708 W. In addition, a narrow band case (line (c)), has higher 
conversion efficiency under 17000W and have lower conversion efficiency beyond 17000W, when compare 
to the broadband case (line (d)). Such phenomenon is explained as follow. A narrow band case is with 
synchronous phases therefore benefits the waves mixing and energy coupling. That implies that a narrow 
band case is liable for forth-conversion and is also liable for back-conversion, when compare to broadband 
case.
