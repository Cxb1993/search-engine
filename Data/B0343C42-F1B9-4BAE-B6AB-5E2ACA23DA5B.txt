changed by tuning the radius of curvature of
the fiber bend, the net gain spectrum is
alterable and the lasing wavelength can be
accordingly tuned.
Fig.1 Fiber cavity loss and net gain spectra for an
erbium-doped fiber laser cavity (a)when the
single-mode fiber (SMF) is not substantially bent and
(b) when the SMF is substantially bent. The net gain
is the erbium-doped fiber gain subtracted by the bend
induced loss on the SMF. The cavity loss refers to that
caused by the partial reflection of end reflectors and
any passive loss by optical components in the laser
cavity.
When an inhomogeneous gain medium,
such as an FPLD added in the EDF cavity,
lasing can occur at two or more wavelengths
by changing the inhomogeneous gain profile.
Such change in inhomogeneous gain profile
can be made by adjusting the injection
current to the FPLD. When multiple
longitudinal modes of the FPLD acquire
sufficient gain, they may compete with each
other and survive against the cavity loss
while amplified by the erbium-doped fiber
amplifier (EDFA). When the SMF is bent,
the multiple lasing wavelengths can be
tuned as a result of the shift of the net gain
spectrum.
III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
Figure 2 (a) shows the proposed fiber
ring laser cavity with an FPLD and an
EDFA being gain media. The mechanical
scheme used for bending the SMF is shown
in Fig.2(b), where a section of SMF is
wound around a post standing amid the two
translation stages upon which the curved
SMF is firmly attached at two ends. The
curvature of radius of the fiber bend can be
adjusted by moving both translation stages.
In the ring cavity, the EDF was 20 meter
long, which had an absorption of 5.0 dB/m
at 980 nm and was pumped by a 60-mW
1480-nm laser diode. A 90/10 fiber coupler
was used to tap out the lasing light at point 4
as indicated. Because the lasing light was
tuned by changing the bend radius of
curvature of the SMF, there would induce a
large variation in optical power. We used an
EDFA (i.e., the booster shown in Fig. 2(a))
to uniform the power at different
wavelengths at the output of the ring laser
cavity. A polarization controller was also
used in the ring cavity to slightly adjust the
lasing power.

The FPLD used here had a 10 nm-wide
stand-alone spectrum centered at 1548 nm
with a mode spacing of ~1.1 nm. In the first
set of experiments, the injection current of
the FPLD was fixed to be slightly larger
than the threshold current 10 mA. The
lasing wavelength was tuned from 1564.4
nm to 1543.8 nm with a step of ~1.1 nm
when the radius of curvature of the fiber
bend was becoming smaller. Figures 3(a) to
(d) show the spectra of the light tapped at
point 4 for the lasing wavelengths of 1543.8
nm, 1548.4 nm, 1558.2 nm and 1564.4 nm,
respectively. It can be seen that all lasing
lights exhibit side mode suppression of ~35
dB in the tuning range of 20.6 nm. The
tapped laser power showed a variation of
~10 dB for the whole tuning range.
However, such power variation was reduced
to 1.9 dB by the booster amplifier, which

the bend radius of curvature of the SMF is getting
smaller.
The proposed fiber ring cavity also
simultaneously lased at triple (quadruple)
wavelengths when the injection current of
the FPLD became ~20 mA (~30 mA). The
lasing spectra for these higher injection
current cases are shown in Figs.5 (a) and (b),
where an SMSR of >34 dB can be seen. To
tune the triple or quadruple wavelengths, we
needed to bend the SMF severely such that
there induced a large net cavity loss. In this
case, some longitudinal modes would not
get sufficient gain for lasing. As a result, the
tuning range for triple-wavelength lasing
was only 7 nm and that for
quadruple-wavelength lasing was only 3
nm.

IV. CONCLUSION
We have proposed an erbium-doped
fiber ring laser, which can emit a
single-wavelength and multiwavelength
laser lights depending on the injection
current of the FPLD incorporated in the
fiber loop. Furthermore, by bending a
section of the single-mode fiber of the ring
cavity, the wavelength can be tuned. For the
case of single-wavelength lasing, the
wavelength tuning range is 20.6 nm, while
the tuning ranges for dual-wavelength,
triple-wavelength and
quadruple-wavelength cases are 10 nm, 7
nm and 3 nm, respectively. The side mode
suppression ratios for most of these lasing
cases are larger than 34 dB. It should be
mentioned that wavelength tuning can be
achieved by bending the single mode fiber
in the loop without FPLD, however with
only single-wavelength lasing obtainable.
Multiple-wavelength lasing is achieved by
adjusting the inhomogeneous gain provided
by the FPLD. If the lights at these
wavelengths acquire sufficient gain, they
would lase unlike the case with only
erbium-doped fiber to supply homogeneous
gain, in which case only one
single-wavelength light survives through
gain competition.
