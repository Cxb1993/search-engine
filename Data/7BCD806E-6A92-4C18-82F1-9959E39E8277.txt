Abstract 
 
 This project studied resistive memory (RRAM) devices employing several materials that are compatible 
to integrated circuits technologies.  These RRAM devices includes TaN/Cu-TaOx/Cu-TaN devices and 
Al/AlOx-CuOx/Al(Cu) devices which were fabricated utilizing plasma oxidation of a copper-doped TaN and a 
copper-doped Al to form the resistor layers, respectively.  This project also studied TaN/TaOxNy/Al devices 
in which a thin AlOx interfacial layer formed automatically and governed resistive switching of the devices.  
Further, this project also studied transparent RRAM devices of AZO/SiO2/ITO.  The TaN/Cu-TaOx/Cu-TaN 
devices exhibited bipolar switching after an initial forming procedure, and their conduction were possibly 
dominated by conductive filaments of mixed TaOx and CuOx phases.  The Al/AlOx-CuOx/Al(Cu) devices 
exhibited unipolar switching after an initial forming procedure, and their conduction was possibly dominated 
by metallic filaments of mixed Al and Cu components.  On the other hand, the TaN/TaOxNy/Al devices 
readily exhibited bipolar switching without needing a forming procedure.  Filaments of oxygen vacancies 
might form in the TaOxNy resistor, and a spontaneously generated AlOx layer at the TaOxNy/Al interface 
promoted vacancies formation.  At last, the transparent AZO/SiO2/ITO devices had transmittance of above 
85% in visible.  The transparent RRAM devices exhibited bipolar switching after a forming procedure, and 
their conduction was dominated by metallic filaments comprising ingredients which came from the electrodes.  
 The results of this project have published two SCI journal papers and submitted three other manuscripts.  
The principle investigator also presented the results in two international conferences.

A thin copper-doped tantalum oxide (Cu–TaOx) ﬁlm was prepared by plasma oxidation of a copper-doped
tantalum nitride (Cu–TaN) and its resistance switching behavior was studied. A Cu–TaN ﬁlm was ﬁrstly de-
posited by co-sputtering of copper and tantalum in a gas mixture of argon and nitrogen as the bottom elec-
trode for a resistance switching device. Subsequently, the Cu–TaN ﬁlm was oxidized in an oxygen-containing
plasma to form an insulating layer. Then a TaN ﬁlm was deposited on top of the insulating layer as the top
electrode to form a MIM structure. The TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN (MIM) device exhibited bipolar resistance
switching when DC voltages were swept. The MIM device was switched from a high resistive state (HRS)
to a low resistive state (LRS) at a SET voltage between +0.65 and +0.85 V, and were switched from LRS to
HRS at a RESET voltage between −0.4 and −0.5 V when a compliant current of 3.5 μA was utilized. The
SET voltage was between +0.7 and +1.15 V and the RESET voltage was around −0.6 V when a compliant
current was set to 13 μA. The resistance ratios of RHRS/RLRS measured at +0.3 V were above 10 and 100
when compliant currents of 3.5 and 13 μA were utilized, respectively. The resistance switch was possibly at-
tributed to the reaction in composite ﬁlamentary paths which were formed inside the Cu–TaOx layer.

1. Introduction
Resistance random access memory (RRAM) has been intensively
studied because of its potential in future nonvolatile memory [1,2].
RRAMwas made of a sandwichedmetal/insulator/metal (MIM) struc-
ture, and it can be reversibly switched between a high resistance state
(HRS) and a low resistance state (LRS) by applying bias voltages [1].
Several materials have demonstrated resistive switching. For exam-
ple, copper-doped oxides have been utilized as the insulator layer
for electrochemical RRAM [3–13]. In this type of RRAM, switching be-
tween LRS and HRS was caused by formation and rupture of conduc-
tive ﬁlaments inside the copper-doped oxides with the assistance of
migration of copper ions [4,6,9]. Therefore, Cu-oxide-based electro-
chemical RRAM was usually composed of an active Cu electrode and
an inert Pt or Ir electrode [4,6]. Our previous study employed sputter
deposition of copper-doped silica and demonstrated bipolar resistive
switching of a Cu/Cu–SiO2/Pt cell with resistance ratios, RHRS/RLRS,
around 100 [11]. The as-deposited Cu–SiO2 ﬁlm was composed of dis-
persed Cu2O crystallites in an amorphous silica matrix, and the Cu/
Cu–SiO2/Pt cell did not need a forming step to initiate resistive
switching. We also utilized tantalum nitride (TaNx) to replace plati-
num as the inert electrode for Cu–SiO2 based RRAM [12,13]. The Cu/
Cu–SiO2/TaNx cell showed resistive switching with RHRS/RLRS ratios
around 5. Performance of the Cu/Cu–SiO2/TaNx RRAMwas further im-
proved by adding a thin tantalum oxynitride (TaON) between TaNx
and Cu–SiO2 [13]. The Cu/Cu–SiO2/TaON/TaNx cell demonstrated
over 100 cycles of resistive switching after a forming step, and RHRS/
RLRS ratios were around 400 [13]. Yet these Cu–SiO2 based RRAM
cells became permanent shortage after cycles of resistance switching.
We speculated that excess Cu migrating from Cu electrode might ac-
cumulate in the resistor ﬁlm and formed thick ﬁlament(s) which
could not be ruptured in regular voltage sweeps. Therefore, study of
a copper-oxide-based RRAM without using an active Cu electrode is
encouraged.
Cu/Ta2O5/Pt and Cu/Ta2O5/Ru cells, another copper-oxide-based
RRAM, have also exhibited resistive switching [14,15]. The Ta2O5 be-
haved as an electrolyte which allowed migration of Cu ions and for-
mation of conductive ﬁlaments. Because we have employed TaNx as
an electrode in Cu–SiO2 base RRAM [12,13], we expected TaNx could
replace Pt in Cu–TaOx based RRAM as well. Meanwhile, active Cu elec-
trode might also be replaced in Cu–TaOx based RRAM if an alternative
process could incorporate Cu in TaOx layer.
TaN has been employed as a barrier metal for Cu metallization in
advanced integrated circuits (IC) [16,17]. Meanwhile, nanocomposite
thin ﬁlms of Cu–TaN have been developed for thin ﬁlm resistors
[18,19]. The resistivity of Cu–TaN ﬁlms varied from less than 400 μΩ
cm to 1000–2000 μΩ cm when Cu content was increased from 0% to
20%–40% [18,19]. Hence both TaN and Cu–TaN could be utilized as
electrodes in RRAM. In this study, we utilized Cu–TaOx as an insulator
layer for TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN RRAM, without using an active Cu

Fig. 2(b), TaOx is present instead of TaON. Consequently, the plasma
oxidation converted the surface of Cu–TaN into CuO–TaOx.
The TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN cell required a forming step with a bias
voltage greater than +1.5 V on the TaN TE and a compliant current of
13 μA to initiate reversible resistive switching. After conducting the form-
ing procedure, the cell was manually brought back to HRS by applying a
voltage sweep to −0.7 V. Then cyclic voltage sweeps were performed
in counterclockwise direction, 0 V→+1.2 V→0 V→−0.7 V→0 V,
with a compliant current of 3.5 or 13 μA for 3 to 5 times. Subsequently, cy-
clic resistive switching of the cell was recorded. Fig. 3 displays I–V curves
for the TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN cell in the 1st and 80th cycles of voltage
sweep with a compliant current of 3.5 μA. The cell exhibits bipolar
switching behavior while bias voltages are swept along counterclock-
wise direction. The cell changes from HRS to LRS at SET voltages be-
tween +0.65 and +0.85 V, and changes back to HRS at RESET
voltages between−0.4 and−0.5 V. Inset at Fig. 3 shows a logarithmic
plot of the I–V curve correlated to the positive bias region in the 80th
cycle of voltage sweep. Two linear regions are present in the lower
curve for HRS. The slopes are 1.16 at low voltages, featuring Ohmic con-
duction (I∞V), and 1.94 at high voltages, featuring Child's law (I∞V2)
[28,29]. As a result, the electrical conduction inHRS of the cell is dominat-
ed by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) mechanism, which was
commonly observed in insulators [28,30]. Similarly, the upper curve for
LRS has two linear regions with slope values of 1.15 and 1.63, respective-
ly. It is different from Ohmic conduction which was commonly observed
from continuous Cu ﬁlaments in Cu-oxide-based electrochemical RRAM
[4,6].
Fig. 4 shows I–V curves of the same TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN cell con-
ducted with a compliant current of 13 μA in the 1st and 20th cycles of
resistance switching. The SET voltages for the cell are between +0.7
and +1.15 V, and the RESET voltages are around−0.6 V. The logarith-
mic plot of I–V curve for the 20th cycle of voltage sweep, as shown in
the inset at Fig. 4, indicates that the SCLC mechanism dominates con-
duction in HRS. On the contrary, the upper curve for LRS shows a linear
region with a slope of 1.01, possibly featuring Ohmic conduction.
Fig. 5 shows temperature dependence of resistance in LRS of the
TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN cell. The resistance values measured at +0.3 V
decrease as temperatures increase for the cells operatedwith compliant
currents of 3.5 and 13 μA, respectively. Inset at Fig. 5 also shows a linear
relation of log R vs 1/T in LRS. It implied that the electrical transport in
LRS was semiconductive rather than metallic conduction. Furthermore,
the cell operated with a low compliant current has a higher resistance
than that with a high compliant current. The dependence of resistances
in LRS with compliant currents suggested that local conductive path
was thicker [31] or percolation of conducting elements was stronger
[5,32] by utilizing higher compliant currents.
The structures of the TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN cell at various states
are suggested and displayed in Fig. 6. Before conducting a forming
step, the oxide layer sandwiched between TaN and Cu–TaN elec-
trodes is made of dispersed CuO clusters inside a TaOx matrix
(upper left ﬁgure). When a high voltage is applied between the TaN
and Cu–TaN electrodes during the forming step, a continuous ﬁla-
ment was formed inside the Cu–TaOx layer. Once a conductive ﬁla-
ment is formed across the Cu–TaOx insulator (lower left ﬁgure), the
cell becomes LRS. Subsequent bias in reverse polarity causes local
rupture of the ﬁlament (lower right ﬁgure) and the cell changes to
HRS. Finally, cyclic formation and rupture of the ﬁlament undergoes
when voltages are swept back and forth, causing bipolar switching
behaviors in the TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN cell. Herein the dispersed
CuO clusters and TaOx matrix were considered as the source for initial
formation of conductive ﬁlament. Filamentary path may be composed
of mixtures of these oxides and/or suboxides with lower resistance
than surrounded matrix phases, featuring semiconductor behavior.
It is different from other Cu-oxide-based electrochemical RRAM in
which Cu migrated from an active Cu electrode to the inert electrode
where it got reduced to form metallic conductive path [4,6,9]. There-
fore, an active Cu electrode was not required in current study of TaN/
Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN RRAM cell.
Furthermore, resistive switching of CuOx and TaOx followed di-
verse conduction behaviors, thus charge transport in the ﬁlamentary

4. Conclusions
A resistor layer of CuO–TaOx was formed by plasma oxidation of the
surface of a Cu–TaN ﬁlm and exhibited bipolar resistance switching. Fil-
amentary conductive path of composite oxides was suggested to form
inside the resistor layer and to facilitate electrical conduction of a TaN/
Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN resistance memory cell, without using an active Cu
electrode. The resistance in LRS were inﬂuenced by the compliant cur-
rents. And the ratio of RHRS/RLRS could be greater than 100 for the
TaN/Cu–TaOx/Cu–TaN cell using 13 μA of compliant current.

acquiring XPS spectra. The XPS depth proﬁles of the oxide layers were
obtained with assistance of sputter etch by a 3-kV Ar ion beam. Cross
sections of the crossbar devices were inspected by a high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM; Philips Tecani G2 F20).
Resistive switching behaviors were obtained by measuring the current–
voltage (I–V) characterization of the crossbar devices using Agilent
B1500A. The bottom Al or Al-Cu electrodes were grounded and the Al
top electrodes were biased with staircase dc voltages sweeps of 40 mV
steps, during the I–Vmeasurements taken at room temperature. Further,
temperature dependence of the resistance of the crossbar devices were
characterized at a constant voltage of +0.2 V at elevated temperatures.
Retention of LRS and HRS were characterized at +0.2 V, at 85 °C.
3. Results and discussion
The as-deposited Al and Al-Cu bottom electrodes were about 250
and 300 nm thick, respectively. Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the surfacemor-
phology of the as-deposited bottom electrodes. The granular size was
between 10 and 100 nm for the Al electrode and about 20 nm for the
Al-Cu electrode. After performing the plasma oxidation, the surfaces
of both electrodes retained the same granular morphology under SEM
observation. The surface roughness values obtained by AFM measure-
ments were 16.2 and 2.7 nm for the as-deposited Al and Al-Cu bottom
electrodes and 18.6 and 2.6 nm after the plasma oxidation. As a conse-
quence, the Al bottom electrode had a rougher surface than that of the
Al-Cu electrode. The surface roughness of both Al and Al-Cu electrodes
did not change after growing a thin oxide layer by utilizing the plasma
oxidation process.
XPS depth proﬁle of the surface of the oxidized Al bottom electrode
suggests that the AlOx layer has gradient concentrations of Al and O
with less O in deeper places, as displayed in Fig. 2(a). The top surface of
the oxidized Al electrode is Al-rich or oxygen-deﬁcient compared to the
stoichiometric Al2O3, and the atomic percentages of Al and O are 52%
and 48%, respectively. The Al 2p spectrum comprises two peaks corre-
sponding to elemental Al at around 73 eV and Al-O at around 75.6 eV,
as shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). As a result, the surface of the Al bottom
electrode is composed of an Al-rich oxide layer (AlOx) with increasing
concentration of Al with depth. Similarly, the surface of the oxidized
Al-Cu bottom electrode is rich in Al and has gradient concentrations of
Al andO across the oxide layer, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The atomic percent-
ages of Al and O are 57% and 43% in the top surface of the oxidized Al-Cu,
respectively. The Al 2p spectrum seen in the inset of Fig. 2(b) also indi-
cates that elementary Al is present in this oxide layer. In addition, Cu is
also found in the surface layer of the oxidized Al-Cu with a gradual
increase of concentration with depth up to 1.9 at.%. Hence, a Cu-doped
AlOx (AlOx-CuOx) layer was formed by the plasma oxidation of the
Al-Cu surface. That less Cu was present in the upper oxide layer was
possibly caused by faster surface oxidation of Al than that of Cu, causing
Al to diffuse towards the surface.
Fig. 3 shows a cross-sectional TEM image of the Al(TE)/AlOx/Al(BE)
specimen with an oxide layer formed by the plasma oxidation of the Al
electrode. The AlOx layer is about 5 nm thick and has an amorphous
structure. Similarly, the oxide layer in the Al(TE)/AlOx-CuOx/Al-Cu(BE)
specimen is amorphous and about 5 nm thick, as shown in Fig. 4. Further
inspection of the TEM image shows several dark spots in the Al-Cu(BE).
These dark spots are possibly the clusters of the Cu-rich phase, dispersed
in the Al-Cu matrix, owing to low solubility of Cu in Al, at room temper-
ature. These clusters are similar to the Cu-rich phase, which has been
observed in Al-Cu alloy ﬁlms with 0.5 wt.% [24] and higher concentra-
tions of Cu [25]. Conversely, dark spots are not observed in the AlOx-CuOx
oxide layer. However, presentlywe cannot reveal whether the AlOx-CuOx
oxide layer has local Cu- or CuOx-rich clusters.
The Al(TE)/AlOx/Al(BE) device was swept with dc voltages form 0 to
above +3.4 V for several times to initiate a forming condition. Subse-
quently, the device showed a unipolar switch of resistance upon dc
voltage sweeps, as shown in Fig. 5. The lower I–V curve in Fig. 5 indicates
that the device remained HRS until the applied voltage reached a SET
voltage of +2.0 V, where the device changed to LRS. After conversion
to LRS, the I–V characteristic follows the upper curve in Fig. 5 then
jumps back to HRS at a RESET voltage of +0.7 V. As shown in the
lower inset of Fig. 5, a slope of 0.99 in log(I)–log(V) plot for LRS (upper
curve) suggests that the electrical conduction follows Ohm's law (I∞V).
The device was further modulated to LRS to measure its resistance at
+0.2 V and elevated temperatures. The result indicated an increase of
the resistance with temperature in LRS, as shown in the upper inset of
Fig. 1. SEMmicrographs of the as-deposited (a) Al surface and (b) Al-5 wt.% Cu surface.

were present inside Al2O3 ﬁlms by a thermal diffusion or an electrical
forming process, facilitated resistive switching of Cu-doped Al2O3 using
pure Cu or CuTe as an active electrode [14,15]. Conductive ﬁlament
(bridge) comprising mixed Cu and CuOx has previously been observed
in a CuO-based RRAM after a forming procedure [26]. Because our
AlOx-CuOx ﬁlm has low concentration of the Cu ingredient, a continuous
Cu ﬁlament might not form inside the AlOx matrix. However, the CuOx
phase inside the AlOx matrix may be converted to clusters of metallic
Cu or low-resistance mixtures of Cu and CuOx during the forming
process. These Cu clusters could induce local enhancement of the
electrical ﬁeld, thus facilitating the formation of short Al ﬁlaments
between them. Consequently, ﬁlaments with mixed Al and Cu were
formed inside the AlOx-CuOx ﬁlm. The Cu ingredient in the AlOx-CuOx
ﬁlm helped to form and rupture the metallic ﬁlaments, causing stable
switching of resistance.
4. Conclusion
Thin ﬁlms of AlOx and AlOx-CuOx formed by plasma oxidation
exhibited unipolar switching of resistance. Electrical conduction of
these RRAM devices in LRS followed Ohm's law with the resistance
increasing with temperature. Hence, metallic ﬁlaments are thought
to form inside the oxide ﬁlms, causing resistive switching of these
devices. Moreover, doping Cu in AlOx improved the stability of the
resistive switching of the RRAM, possibly due to the formation of
ﬁlaments of mixed Al and Cu phases. The Al(TE)/AlOx-CuOx/Al-Cu(BE)
device retained high resistance ratios of 105 during 100 cycles of resis-
tance switching at room temperature, and its LRS and HRS were stable
for 104 s of retention test at 85 °C.

thermomechanical dissolution of part of conductive filament(s) switches an ECM cell from LRS to a high 
resistance state (HRS). 
In general, Cu-based ECM cells are composed of an active Cu electrode, an inert electrode, and an 
insulator layer made of SiO2 [4‒6], MoOx [7], WO3 [8], ZrO2 [9,10], Ta2O5 [11,12], or ZnO [13], etc.  To 
activate a Cu-based ECM cell, an initial forming step was conducted to generate filamentary path(s) of Cu in 
the oxide layer.  Subsequent applying voltage sweeps in alternate polarities reversibly induced rupture and 
connection of the Cu filament(s) in a Cu-based ECM cell.  Occasionally an ECM cell failed to return to HRS 
because permanent conductive filaments were formed in the oxide layer by oversupply of Cu from a Cu 
electrode.  Alternatively, CuTe has been employed to replace pure Cu as an active electrode in Cu-based 
ECM cells [14,15].  A Cu‒MoOx layer has also been utilized as a Cu source in an ECM cell to improve 
stability of Cu filament in an insulating Gd2O3 layer [16].  Recently, Park et al. [17] demonstrated resistance 
switching of a Pt/Cu‒HfO2/Pt RRAM.  In their study, an active Cu electrode was initially utilized to produce 
a single Cu filament in HfO2, and then the Cu electrode was replaced by an inert Pt electrode.  Stability of 
their ECM cell was improved possibly due to the elimination of unlimited Cu source from an active Cu 
electrode.  Hence, a Cu electrode is not required in a Cu-based ECM cell if Cu has already been incorporated 
in the resistor layer. 
 RRAM cells composed of Cu and SiO2 are of interest because they can be implemented into current 
integrated circuits technologies [18].  Our previous studies employed Cu−doped SiO2 (Cu−SiO2) as a resistor 
layer together with an active Cu electrode and an inert Pt, Al or TaN electrode to fabricate Cu‒SiO2 RRAM 
[19‒21].  Stability of our Cu‒SiO2 RRAM was improved by adding an intermediate layer of oxide or 
oxynitride between the Cu‒SiO2 resistor layer and the inert electrodes [19‒21].  We have also employed 
Cu-doped TaN and Cu-doped Al as an electrode with a low Cu content in TaN/Cu‒TaOx/Cu–TaN and Al/Cu‒
AlOx/Cu–Al RRAM cells and showed resistance switching through filamentary path of composite phases, 
respectively [22,23].  In this study, we demonstrate resistive switching of TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN RRAM, 
without utilizing an active Cu-containing electrode.  The effect of thin oxynitride between the Cu‒SiO2 
resistor and the TaN electrode on resistance switching is also presented.   
 
2. Experimental details 
 
 Cross bar structure of TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN cells with an area of 50×50 µm2 were fabricated on top of a 
Si(100) substrate which was covered with a 500-nm-thick oxide layer.  A 40-nm-thick Cu‒SiO2 film was 
deposited by co-sputtering of Cu and SiO2 targets as a resistor layer [24].  TaN stripes of about 100 nm thick 
and 50 µm wide were deposited by reactive sputtering of Ta through metal masks [21] as top electrodes (TE) 
and bottom electrodes (BE).  Surface of the TaN BE of some specimens were oxidized in a plasma of mixed 
Ar and O2 to form a TaON film of around 10 nm thick before depositing the Cu‒SiO2 resistor layer [21].  
Details of the sputter deposition and plasma oxidation processes were described elsewhere [19,21].  Cross 
section of the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN cell was inspected by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope 
(HRTEM; Philips Tecani G2 F20).  Composition of the Cu‒SiO2 layer was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS; VG ESCA Scientific Theta Probe) using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation.  Current-voltage 
(I‒V) characteristics of the MIM cells were analyzed in ambient using an Agilent B1500A. 
 
  
           28  
studied.  This cell needs a forming step at +3 V before performing cyclic resistance switching.  The 
TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell with additional TaON layer, also shows bipolar switching of resistance in 
counterclockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 4 of the I‒V curves for the 100th cycle of voltage sweep.  This 
cell switches from HRS to LRS at a voltage of about +0.8 V with a sudden increase of current, and then the 
current gradually increases with applied voltages until reaching a compliant current.  LRS retains during 
subsequent sweeping of negative voltages until –1.6 V, where the cell changes from LRS to HRS.  As shown 
in Fig. 5(a), the RHRS/RLRS ratios for the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell in 100 cycles of resistance switching 
are about 100, which is higher than those for the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN cell.  Therefore, adding a thin 
oxynitride layer in a TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN cell would increase RHRS/RLRS ratios, similar to the effect of adding 
an oxynitride layer in a Cu/Cu‒SiO2/TaN cell in a previous study [21]. 
Inset in Fig. 4 displays a logarithmic plot of the I‒V curves for the 100th cycle of voltage sweep for the 
TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell.  The slopes for LRS and HRS in the low voltage region are 1.22 and 1.56, 
respectively.  Hence, the cell does not exhibit Ohmic or SCLC conduction in LRS and HRS.  To realize the 
conduction mechanism for the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell, plots of ln(I) against V1/2 for both LRS and 
HRS are shown in Fig. 5(b).  Both curves are linear, therefore, the electrical conduction in the LRS and HRS 
of the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell are dominated by Schottky emission, which is an 
electrode-barrier-limited conduction mechanism [27,28].  As a result, adding a TaON layer between Cu-SiO2 
and TaN changes conduction mechanism for both LRS and HRS from SCLC for TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN cell to 
Schottky emission for TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell. 
SCLC has been considered to dominate electrical conduction in semiconductor Cu2O film [25].  But 
Ohmic conduction was observed in a CuO-based RRAM consisting of filamentary path of mixed Cu and 
CuOx [29].  On the other hand, electrical conduction of an SiOx-based RRAM has been attributed to charge 
transport along filamentary paths containing O vacancies [30], Si inclusions [31], or Si nanocrystals [32].  In 
this study, electrical conduction might be attributed to charge transport through paths of discontinuous CuOx 
and SiOx phases in the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN cell, as shown in Fig. 6(a).  Both CuOx and SiOx phases could be 
reduced and oxidized during cyclic voltage sweeps.  The filamentary path possibly comprised low resistivity 
CuOy and SiOy in LRS, whereas local region of the filament changed to high resistivity oxide phases such as 
Cu2O or SiO2 in HRS.  Because Cu2O, SiO2, CuOy and SiOy are semiconductors, electrical conduction 
through filamentary paths in HRS and LRS of the TaN/Cu–SiO2/TaN cell would follow SCLC mechanism.  
Fig. 6(b) shows a schematic of conduction paths in LRS and HRS of the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell.  
Although there was a thin TaON layer between the resistor layer and the TaN BE, the forming procedure may 
generate filamentary path comprising discrete CuOy and SiOy inside the Cu‒SiO2 layer, similar to the 
analogue of conductive path in the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN cell.  The filament worked as an extended TE to 
contact TaON and formed a pseudo M(TE)/TaON/TaN(BE) cell.  Therefore, when the TE and BE of the 
TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell is biased, electrical charges transport across the intermediate TaON layer and 
through filamentary path in Cu‒SiO2 resistor layer.  The filamentary path had a high resistance in HRS and a 
low resistance in LRS due to rupture and connection of the filament, respectively.  However, the TaON layer 
remained to be a barrier for electrical conduction in both LRS and HRS.  Therefore, the electrical conduction 
for LRS and HRS in TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell were dominated by Schottky emission, but the resistance 
switching was attributed to the connection and rupture of the conductive filament. 
In comparison, Schottky emission has also been observed in HRS of a Cu/Cu‒SiO2/TaON/TaN cell in a

Abstract 
 
Resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices were fabricated using sequential sputter deposition of Al, 
tantalum oxynitride (TaOxNy), and tantalum nitride (TaN).  Cross section of the TaN/TaOxNy/Al device was 
analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, and a thin alumina (AlOz) layer of around 4 nm was presented 
at the TaOxNy/Al interface. The resistive switching properties of the devices were characterized by cyclic 
current!voltage measurements. The RRAM devices exhibited bipolar switching of resistance without needing 
a high-voltaged forming procedure.  Further studies of the area and temperature dependence of resistance of 
the RRAM devices suggested that filamentary paths comprising oxygen vacancies might dominate the 
resistive switching of the TaN/TaOxNy/Al RRAM devices.  The interfacial reaction between Al and TaOxNy 
possibly changed distribution of oxygen vacancies and facilitate resistive switching of these devices.

using Keithley 2410 Sourcemeter and four-point probes.  Cyclic current-voltage (I-V) curves of the 
TaN/TaOxNy/Al devices were measured using Agilent B1500A with staircase of d.c. voltage sweeps of 20 
mV steps. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the blanket Al, TaOxNy and TaN films deposited on the SiO2/Si 
substrates.  The Al film is with high crystallinity, showing (111), (200), (200) and (311) reflections at 
diffraction angles, 2θ, of 38.52°, 44.74°, 65.12°, and 78.28°, respectively [JCPDS 65-2869].  The TaOxNy 
film is amorphous, showing a large bump near 2θ of 21.5°.  The XRD pattern of the TaN film has 4 broad 
reflections at 2θ of 35.56°, 41.60°, 60.58° and 71.74°, corresponding to (111), (200), (200) and (311) 
reflections of the fcc TaN crystal [JCPDS 49-1283].  Therefore, the TaN/TaOxNy/Al device is composed of 
an amorphous TaOxNy film sandwiched between crystalline TaN and Al electrodes. 
Blanket Al, TaOxNy, and TaN films of around 150 nm thick were separately deposited on the SiO2/Si 
substrates for resistivity measurement.  The resistivity of the Al film is 4.08 µΩ-cm.  The resistivity of the 
TaN film is 677 µΩ-cm, which agrees with that of fcc TaN prepared by reactive sputtering [18].  The 
resistivity of the TaOxNy film is 2×104 µΩ-cm.  According to the resistivity values of above thin films, the 
resistance of a TaN(150 nm)/TaOxNy(50 nm)/Al(180 nm) stack device with a TaN TE of 150 µm in diameter 
would be about 620 µΩ.  Yet the measured resistance of the as-prepared TaN/TaOxNy/Al device was above 
10 Ω.  Therefore, these films might have interacted to form a complex structure, causing a higher resistance 
of the stack device.    
Fig. 2 shows a high-resolution TEM image of the cross section of a TaN/TaOxNy/Al stack near the 
TaOxNy/Al interface.  An interfacial AlOz film of about 4 nm thick is present between the TaOxNy and Al 
films.  The thin AlOz film might form spontaneously during deposition of the TaOxNy film because oxygen 
affinity of Al is higher than that of Ta [19].  Similar interfacial aluminum oxide has also formed between Al 
electrodes and various oxide resistors in RRAM devices [14-17].  On the other hand, the TaOxNy near the 
TaOxNy/Al interface might have less oxygen than in the TaOxNy film because O is scavenged to the surface of 
the Al BE, leaving oxygen vacancy (VO¨) behind.  Therefore, a complex structure might form and govern the 
electrical properties in the TaN/TaOxNy/Al device. 
Resistance switching was performed by applying voltage sweeps to the TaN/TaOxNy/Al device with a 
TE diameter of 150 µm.  The TaN TE was cyclically biased while the Al BE was grounded during the 
measurement, as shown at the right inset of Fig. 3.  The as-prepared device readily exhibited resistance 
switching without needing a prior forming procedure.  The cyclic voltage sweeps were applied in clockwise 
direction, −1.5 V→0 V→+1.5 V→0 V→−1.5 V, with a compliant current of 30 mA.  Fig. 3 displays the I−V 
plot of the TaN/TaOxNy/Al device in the 500th cycle of voltage sweep.  The device is in a low resistance 
state (LRS) at the beginning of a switch cycle from −1.5 V to +1.5 V.  Then the device smoothly changes to 
a high resistance state (HRS) while the voltage sweep is conducted from +1.5 V to 0 V. The device changes

4. Conclusion 
 
A TaN/TaOxNy/Al structure fabricated by sputter deposition exhibited bipolar switching of resistance.  
An AlOx interfacial layer was present at the TaOxNy/Al interface and possibly governed the resistance 
switching of the TaN/TaOxNy/Al device.  The electrical conduction was through filamentary path of oxygen 
vacancies.  When the TaN TE was negatively biased, the AlOx layer could scavenge oxygen ions from the 
TaOxNy layer leaving oxygen vacancies to from continuous filaments.  When the TaN TE was positively 
biased, the AlOx layer could provide oxygen ions to annihilate oxygen vacancies and to rupture the filaments.

Abstract 
 
Transparent resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices comprising an aluminum-doped zinc oxide 
(AZO) top electrode and a silicon oxide (SiOx) resistor layer were fabricated on top of an indium tin oxide 
(ITO) glass by sputter deposition at room temperature.  The average transmittance of the 
AZO/SiOx/ITO-glass was 85% in the visible region.  The transparent RRAM devices exhibited bipolar 
switching of resistance after a prior forming procedure at +7.2 V, and the device could be reversibly switched 
between high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS) for 100 times with resistance ratios, 
RHRS/RLRS, higher than 16.  Further characterizations of area dependent and temperature dependent 
resistance of the transparent RRAM devices suggest that resistance switching of the device is attributed to the 
reaction of metal-like filamentary paths inside the SiOx.  Incorporation of Zn, Al, In, and Sn in the SiOx, as 
revealed by the depth profile of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the AZO/SiOx/ITO structure, possibly 
facilitated the formation of conductive filaments.

room temperature.  The bottom ITO electrode was grounded and the top AZO electrode was swept with 
staircase of d.c. voltages with 20 mV steps during the I-V measurements.  Transmittance of the 
AZO/SiOx/ITO/glass stack was obtained using a UV-Vis spectrometer (JASCO V-670). 
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
Fig. 1(b) shows HRTEM image of the cross-section of the AZO/SiOx/ITO structure.  Both the AZO and 
the ITO layers are crystalline, with clear lattice fringes.  The SiOx layer sandwiched between AZO and ITO 
is amorphous, as revealed by the halo diffraction pattern at the inset of Fig. 1(b).  Chemical compositions of 
the AZO/SiOx/ITO are further revealed by the XPS depth profile, as shown in Fig. 2.  The left region is the 
AZO layer and the right region is the ITO layer according to the elements present in the respective regions.  
The middle region, with high Si and O concentrations, is SiOx.  Except Si and O, Zn and Al are also present 
in the upper SiOx film, and In and Sn are present in the lower SiOx film.  According to the gradient 
concentrations of Zn, Al, In, and Sn in the SiOx layer, interfacial diffusion might take place during sputter 
depositions of the SiOx layer on the ITO surface and the AZO layer on the SiOx surface, similar to the 
interfacial diffusion observed in ITO/SiO2/ITO RRAM prepared by sputter deposition [6].  Therefore, the 
SiOx film in this study is doped with Zn, Al, In, and Sn due to the interdiffusion induced by the sputter 
deposition processes. 
SiOx of about 10 nm thick and 2 mm in diameter and AZO of about 100 nm thick and 150 µm in 
diameter were sequentially deposited on a TCO glass with 50-nm-thick ITO to form an AZO/SiOx/ITO 
RRAM device.  The as-prepared AZO/SiOx/ITO device is in a high resistance state (HRS) until a bias 
voltage of +7.2 V is applied to the AZO TE, where the RRAM device changes to a low resistance state (LRS), 
as shown at the left inset of Fig. 3.  This initial switch on procedure is known as the Forming [1].  After the 
forming procedure, resistance of the AZO/SiOx/ITO device can be cyclically switched in counterclockwise 
direction of voltage sweep of +1.5 V→0 V→−2.0 V→0 V→+1.5 V, as indicated by the 1st and the 50th cycles 
of I-V curves shown in Fig. 3.  The AZO/SiOx/ITO device exhibits bipolar switching of resistance with SET 
voltages of about +0.3  to +0.5 V, where it changes from HRS to LRS, and RESET voltages of about −1.3 V, 
where it changes from LRS to HRS.  The AZO/SiOx/ITO device shows stable resistance switch during 100 
cycles of I-V measurements, as shown in the right inset of Fig. 3.  The ratio of resistance (RHRS/RLRS) 
measured at −0.1 V is about 16. 
To realize the mechanisms for electric conduction in the AZO/SiOx/ITO devices, the logarithmic plots of 
the I-V curves in the positive voltage region of the 50th cycle of resistance switch are displayed in Fig. 4(a).  
The fitting curves at low voltages region for the LRS and HRS are linear with slopes of 1.04 and 1.00, 
featuring Ohmic conduction (I∞V), respectively.  On the other hand, electrical conduction at high voltages 
regions are not Ohmic owing to the slopes of 1.14 for the LRS and 1.25 for the HRS, respectively.  Instead, 
Poole-Frenkel emission [18] dominates electric conduction for both the LRS and HRS at high voltages region,

Resistive Switching of TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN Devices

Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is considered as a promising nonvolatile memory device [1].  
RRAM consists of a dielectric layer sandwiched between two electrodes, and it exhibits two resistance states 
which can be reversibly switched by applying voltage sweeps.  The electrodes may consist of ionic metals, 
such as Cu, which diffuses in a dielectric layer to form a conductive path under a high electric field [2] or a 
high temperature [3] at the beginning of a forming procedure.   Our previous studies have utilized a 
co-sputtering technique to deposit Cu‒doped SiO2 layers and 
demonstrated resistive switching of Cu/Cu‒SiO2/Pt and 
Cu/Cu‒SiO2/TaN devices without using a forming procedure [4,5].   
In this study, we further find that an ionic metal electrode is not 
required in a TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN RRAM. 
Both TaN electrodes and Cu‒SiO2 films were prepared by 
sputter deposition techniques on surface of SiO2‒coated silicon 
substrates.   The Cu‒SiO2 layer is composed of dispersed Cu2O 
nanocrystals in an SiO2 matrix, as shown in Figure 1.  The atomic 
ratio of Cu:Si obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is about 1:9.  The SiO2 matrix is 
deficient in oxygen.  Therefore, oxygen vacancies are present in the Cu‒SiO2 film. 
A TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN device with Cu‒SiO2 film of about 40 nm thickness and an electrode area of 
50×50 µm2 was analyzed.  The device readily demonstrated bipolar switching of resistance in 
counterclockwise direction without applying a forming 
procedure.  Figure 2 shows the current‒voltage plots of the 
device in the 98th, 99th and 100th cycles of voltage sweeps.  
The device changes from a high resistance state (HRS) to a 
low resistance state (LRS) at a set voltage of +1.3 to +1.7 V, 
and from LRS to HRS at a reset voltage of ‒1.1 to ‒1.2 V.    
The resistance ratios, RHRS/RLRS, measured at +0.3 V are about 
10.  Herein, conductive filaments possibly formed inside the 
Cu‒SiO2 layer even though both electrodes were made of TaN.  
Presence of oxygen vacancies and Cu2O nanocrystals might 
facilitate formation of conductive filaments and resistive switching in the TaN/Cu‒SiO2/TaN RRAM.
