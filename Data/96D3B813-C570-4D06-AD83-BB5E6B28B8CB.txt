method is based mainly on the dissipative 
energy, the method is easier, reliable and 
quite robust to the noise.  In addition, there 
requires no master standard piece, either.  
Furthermore, the present calibration method 
is energy-based, therefore, it can be applied 
to all environment no matter the probe is 
used in water, vacuum, or air.  In other 
words, the method is supposed to be more 
perspective from the industrial point of view. 
The outcome is TW patent pending.

二、緣由與目的 
在奈米科學研究中，SPM(Scanning 
Probe Microscopes)一直就是不可欠缺的主
要工具，而與 SPM 相關的研究，除了應用
SPM 來觀測或發現新的微觀現象外，以對
SPM 本身之開發研究為大宗，一方面包括
如 SPM 之製作開發[e.g., 3]，週邊環境之控
制(如振動與聲音之隔離、溫度或雜訊之控
制等)，SPM 操作介面與訊號後處理(如影
像訊號處理、過濾等)，及探針之製作研究
等；另一方面，解讀 SPM 所擷取之訊號，
特別是透過已知之原、分子動力學之理論
或模擬[e.g., 2-7]，以 2D 或 3D 圖像顯示也
是相當重要的。 
依探針感應方式之不同，一般原子力
掃描顯微儀(AFM)之探針，如果加上力量
量測之回饋[8]，大約可以感測到 10-12 N 之
力量大小，目前各方正在努力將這個尺度
向 10-18 N 推進[9]，在如此微小的力量尺度
下，任何可能造成誤差之來源，都必須盡
力消除，或至少降低其影響，正確有效的
校準方法當然也是不可缺的。一般 AFM 之
訊號擷取部份，大都是以電子零組件配合
軟體進行，其誤差或可以相關之電子電路
補償，而唯獨探針懸臂樑之彈簧常數，依
計畫主持人之瞭解，仍然沒有一公認較佳
之方法。

the meantime, it had assumed that the 
dissipative energy could be correctly 
measured, while it can be calculated from the 
model.  The results are given in Table 1 
where the notations with over-hat denote 
estimated values.   
It can be seen clearly from the table that 
quite small percentage of errors for estimated 
stiffness k.  Even when the error in the 
quality factor, Q , is as large as ca. +6.19 %, 
the present identification method still can 
correctly recognize the probe stiffness with 
acceptable amount of errors (+5.18 %).  
Notice also that it has a trend that the larger 
damping tends to have a lager error in 
stiffness estimation. This may mainly stems 
from the approximate form of the Q- 
sharpness factor in (12). Furthermore, when 
system damping is small, the estimated error 
for stiffness also tends to increase. However, 
the reason is because that discrete numerical 
simulation is normally hard to accurately 
locate their peaks when system responses are 
very sharp. This is somehow different from 
those of larger damping.

3.3 實驗驗證 
In addition to the numerical verifi- 
cations given, several experimental measure- 
ments were carried out. The main objective 
of the experiments is to verify the validity of 
(16) or (18). The experimental setup for the 
measurements is shown in Fig. 4. The test 
specimen was an austenite stainless steel 
(Young’s modulus E = 210 GPa) cantilever 
with dimensions 1.6T  20.2W  194L mm (ca. 
45.68 g) directly mounted to a shaker by a 
bolt. At the end of the beam, it was a plastic 
straw with the length 96 mm and the outer 
diameter 8.6 mm (ca. 2 g) firmly glued to one 
end of the beam.  Meanwhile, in order to 
simulate the damping forces acting on the 
beam, the straw was inserted into a cup of 
viscid fluid during the experiments. The 
depth of submersion was set in such a way 
that the straw was at the depth d when the 
beam at its static equilibrium position. For 
example, in the case of d = 0 mm, the tip of 
the straw was just about to contact the liquid 
surface before the beam started oscillating. 
On the other hand, the tip completely 
immersed inside the viscid fluid during the 
oscillations if d = 30 mm or larger. Since the 
damping force is proportional to the depth 
inside the liquid, the straw thus was to mimic 
the attractive and repulsive forces acting to 
the cantilever from the tip of probes. Refer to 
Fig. 4 the details of the setup.   
During the experiments, the sampling 
frequency fs was set to 200 Hz. And, sinuso- 
idal excitations with the constant frequency 
() were applied from the controller to the 
shaker and detected by accelerometer 1 (S1, 
DYTRAN Model 3136A), which directly 
mounted on the base of the cantilever. The 
amplitudes of these excitations were all kept 
the same while its frequency may be changed 
if so desired. The system responses were then 
detected and acquired by accelerometer 2 (S2, 
DYTRAN Model 3031B, wt. 5.5 g), which 
was located at the free end of the beam ca. 
186 mm from its fixed point. Both signals 
were then acquired and sent to a laptop 
computer for the later analyses.   
The equivalent flexural stiffness of the 
current test specimen, modeled as a canti- 
lever beam, may be found from fundamental 
textbooks, or

Case 4 and 5 shown in Table 2 represent 
two strongly nonlinear damping systems.  
The straw was set slightly above the viscid 
fluid surface when it was in its static 
equilibrium. When the beam started oscil- 
lating, one half of the straw oscillation stays 
in the liquid while the other half in air. The 
former half in fluid stands for a strong 
damping, while the latter one for weakly 
damped. Even though the identified results 
shown in the table are still quite reasonable, 
the possible reason may originate from that 
the present method is actually evaluate the 
equivalent dissipative energy. It does not 
matter if the energy is initiated from linear or 
nonlinear damping. However, it has been 
found that the main error source of these 
experimental measurements were from 
determining the location of 0. This situation 
also implies that a robust control algorithm 
may be needed in case of systems with 
strongly nonlinear damping. Nevertheless, 
the experimental results once again 
confirmed that the present identification 
method can successfully detect the spring 
constant of a cantilever beam which mimics 
the probe of AFMs.
