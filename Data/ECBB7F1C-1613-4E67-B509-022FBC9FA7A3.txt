英文摘要 
In this project, InGaP/InGaAs integrated enhancement/depletion-mode doped-channel 
pseudomorphic HFETs on the same chip by selectively etching process are first demonstrated. 
The double-doped channels are formed in the depletion device, while only one channel appears 
in the enhancement device. Because the presence of the considerable conduction band 
discontinuity at InGaP/InGaAs heterojunction, it forms subband and 2DEG in the InGaAs strain 
channel, which increases the concentration in InGaAs active channel and carriers could be also 
modulated with the applied gate biases. Thus, the studied devices perform with the combination 
of DCFETs and high electron mobility transistors.  
For the depletion-mode device, the drain-to-source saturation voltage is only 0.3 V as the 
VGS is fixed at 0 V. An extrinsic transconductance of 411 (278) mS/mm and a saturation current 
density of 221 (482) mA/mm are obtained for the enhancement (depletion) device. Furthermore, 
due to the low drain-to-source saturation voltage, the noise margin is substantially increased for 
the inverter applications.  
 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
Heterostructure field effect transistors (HFETs), such as electron mobility transistors 
(HEMTs), doped-channel field effect transistors (DCFETs), and heterostructure 
metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs), etc., have attracted considerable 
attention for signal amplifier and digital integrated circuit applications [1-7]. Transistor 
performances with high output current and linearity are especially essential for large signal and 
linear amplification in circuit applications. A variety of improved HFETs were fabricated and 
investigated to promote the drain output current and transconductance. Although the 
transconductance of HEMTs may be relatively high due to the high carrier mobility of the 
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the modulated channel, electrons will travel through the 
large energy-gap as well as low-mobility gate layer under sufficiently large gate bias. The 
magnitude of the forward gate bias is severely limited due to the so-called parallel conduction 
problem. This will degrade the device linearity and current driving capability [1, 2]. These 
devices are not suitable for large input signal operation. On the other hand, DCFETs could 
exhibit higher current handling capability, broader gate voltage swing, and excellent device 
linearity resulting from the good confinement of electrons in doped channel and the usable 
undoped gate layer, as compared to the HEMTs. The large gate voltage swing could improve the 
device linearity and reduce the higher order harmonic terms, which will provide a promise for 
linear amplifier applications. In other words, the output gains of the DCFETs are less sensitive to 
the input signal level and they could show good device linearity [2]. However, the channel 
concentrations were fixed and the drain-to-source (D-S) saturation voltages were considerably 
large [5, 6]. This severely limits the device operation region in signal circuit application.  
Recently, HFETs have provided excellent figures of merit in logic circuit applications. The 
四、研究成果 
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) depict the corresponding energy band diagrams of the depletion and 
enhancement-mode devices, respectively, at equilibrium. As to the depletion-mode device, the 
upper doped-channel layer is entirely depleted and the depletion region is justly immersed into 
the lower doped-channel layer at equilibrium. Because the presence of the considerable 
conduction band discontinuity (ΔEc ~ 0.38 eV) at In0.49Ga0.51P/In0.2Ga0.8As heterojunction [3], it 
provides a large potential barrier preventing the injection of electrons into gate electrode from 
channel and increases forward gate operation voltage. Furthermore, unlike the conventional 
MESFETs, it forms subband and 2DEG in the lower InGaAs strain channel, which increases the 
channel concentration [5, 13]. On the other hand, for the enhancement-mode device the 
doped-channel layer is completely depleted at equilibrium and the active channel appears under 
sufficient large gate forward bias.

the integrated HFETs and Ref. [10] are listed in Table 1. At the same supply voltages, the noise 
margins are larger than the report. As compared with both of the DCFLs, our DCFL shows the 
lower VOL and VIH values in the driver transistor and the higher VOH and VIL values in the load 
transistor due to the low D-S saturation voltages, even though the gate width of depletion-mode 
load transistor is reduced in Ref. [10]. Consequently, the supply voltages could be further 
reduced because the noise margins of the DCFL are relatively large.

五、結論 
In summary, the integration of enhancement/depletion-mode InGaP/InGaAs doped-channel 
pseudomorphic HFETs have been successfully fabricated and investigated. The integrated devices 
show low D-S saturation voltage, high output current, and broad gate voltage swing, 
simultaneously. Furthermore, the relatively large noise margins are achieved in the DCFL 
application. Consequently, the integrated devices provide a promise for large signal and linear 
amplification and direct-coupled FET logic applications.

Abstract. In this article, a novel InGaP/GaAs pnp δ-doped heterojunction bipolar transistor is first 
demonstrated. Though the valence band discontinuity at InGaP/GaAs heterojunction is relatively 
large, the addition of a δ-doped sheet between two spacer layers at the emitter-base junction 
effectively eliminates the potential spike and increases the confined barrier for electrons, 
simultaneously. Experimentally, a high current gain of 25 and an offset voltage of 100 mV are 
achieved. The offset voltage is much smaller than the conventional InGaP/GaAs pnp HBT. The 
proposed device could be used for linear amplifiers and low-power complementary integrated 
circuit applications.  
 
Introduction 
Npn heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) in combination with pnp HBTs have been used 
for the implementations of low-power complementary integrated circuits and push-pull microwave 
amplifiers [1,2]. Over the past years, npn InGaP/GaAs HBTs have received considerable interest in 
the replacement of AlGaAs/GaAs material systems due to (i) the large valence band discontinuity 
(∆Ev ≈ 0.35 eV) to conduction band discontinuity (∆Ec ≈ 0.15 eV) ratio of InGaP/GaAs material 
system, (ii) high etching selectivity between InGaP and GaAs layers, (iii) low density of DX center, 
and (iv) low surface recombination velocity of InGaP layer [3,4]. However, the performances of 
complementary HBT-based circuits are severely limited by the pnp transistors due to the small 
current gain resulting part from the low hole mobility. Previously, the first InGaP/GaAs pnp HBT 
was reported [5]. Because of the large ∆Ev value at emitter-base (E-B) heterojunction giving rise to 
a potential spike blocking the hole injection from the emitter across the base, the device exhibited a 
notable emitter-collector (E-C) offset voltage (∆VEC) of about 800 mV. It might increase the 
undesirable power consumption in digital circuit applications [5].  
In this article, we report a new InGaP/GaAs pnp HBT with a heavily δ-doped sheet between 
two spacer layers at the E-B junction for more effectively reducing the potential spike and 
increasing the confined barrier for electrons. Excellent DC performances including a high current

The typical common-emitter current-voltage (I-V) characteristic at room temperature, 
measured by an HP4155B semiconductor parameter analyzer, is shown in Fig. 2. The base current 
IB is applied by –20 µA/step. The device performances exhibit a maximum collector current 
of –1.75 mA and a maximum current gain of 25, respectively. Though the base to emitter doping 
ratio of the studied device is larger than the former InGaP/GaAs pnp HBT, the current gains of the 
two devices are close to the same [5]. A relatively low offset voltage of only 100 mV at IB = –20 µA 
is observed. The value is much smaller than that of the InGaP/GaAs pnp HBT without the δ-doped 
design [5].  
Figure 3 illustrates the Gummel plots of the studied device at VCB = 0 V. The ideality factor nc 
for collector current is nearly equal to unity at low current levels. This means that the 
thermionic-emission and diffusion mechanisms dominate the hole transportation across the E-B 
junction. Also, a low E-B turn-on voltage of about 1.08 V is obtained at the current level of 0.1 mA 
due to the reduction of the potential spike. The low turn-on value could reduce the operation 
voltage and decrease the power consumption in digital circuit applications. On the other hand, the 
ideality factor for base current nb is equal to 1.2 at low current levels, which means that the 
additions of a δ-doped sheet and two spacer layers do not increase the base recombination current 
excessively and degrade the device performance. Based on the elimination of the potential spike at 
the E-B junction, a high current gain at low current level is observed. Thus, the studied device 
exhibiting high device linearity, i.e., current gain β versus collector current IC, is proper for linear 
amplifier applications.
