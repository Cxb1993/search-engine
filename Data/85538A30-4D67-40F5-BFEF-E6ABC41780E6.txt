The recycling of end-of-life magnesium products is important because Mg
alloy has an increasing number of uses in automotive and electronic consumer
applications. Currently, however, only high-grade Mg scraps are recyclable and
over half of all Mg scraps cannot be processed economically. This work proposes a
new method for generating H2 gas in NaCl aqueous solution by the hydrolysis of a
secondary Mg sample made of low-grade Mg alloy scraps at 20 °C. A Pt-coated Ti
net was used to catalyze hydrolysis between a Pt film and an Mg sample. When the
Pt-coated Ti net was statically pressed on the surface of the Mg sample, the mean H2
generation rate was around 302.3 ml min-1 (g of catalyst weight)-1 for 1600 sec.
When the Pt-coated Ti net catalyst was ground onto the Mg sample surface, the rate
of H2 production by the system improved significantly. The total volume of H2
generated was around 7.5 times that generated when the catalyst was statically loaded
on the surface of the Mg sample. The mean H2 generation rate was around 432.4 ml
min-1(g of catalyst)-1 over 8100 sec. The grinding of the catalyst against the surface
of the sample caused the removing of the Mg(OH)2 passive layer, generating a large
volume of H2.
31. Introduction
The automotive industry must develop a clean and energetically efficient
vehicle to reduce CO2 emissions. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is
highly efficient and has a high power density [1,2]. The fuel cell has attracted interest
as a power source to solve the environmental problems associated with transportation
[3,4]. This system is powered by hydrogen as an environmentally friendly anodic fuel,
forming only water as a reduction product. However, unlike oil, gas or natural gas, for
example, H2 is only an energy carrier, and not a source of energy. It must be
manufactured using energy from other sources [5]. Currently, processes for the mass
production of hydrogen gas actually consume more energy than that contained in the
hydrogen produced [6]. Therefore, a new renewable H2 generator is required to ensure
long-term sustainability and the fuel supply. Amendola et al. [7,8] studied an
alternative method for generating hydrogen gas from sodium borohydride (NaBH4),
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in solution H2O using a Ru-based catalyst. When aqueous
NaBH4 solution comes into contact with the catalyst, it spontaneously hydrolyzes to
produce H2 gas and sodium borate (NaBO2) [9]. Studies of this approach are important
to help produce high-quality hydrogen without polluting emissions. However, one
shortcoming is that NaBH4 is made from borax, much of which is found globally natural
5from waste metallic magnesium, catalyzed by a platinum-coated titanium net in aqueous
NaCl.
2. Background on use of end-of-life magnesium scraps to generate H2
The resistance of magnesium alloy against corrosion depends on factors that are
similarly critical to the resistance of other metals. However, magnesium alloy has high
electrochemical activity [19,20], which significantly increases the relative importance of
some factors, reducing the corrosion resistance. Chemical composition is one of the
main factors. Iron, nickel and copper have extremely negative effects on the alloy’s
corrosion performance because their low solid-solubility limits promote the formation of
intermetallic compounds in the Mg matrix [21,22]. For example, the ASTM B93
standard composition limits of AZ91D Mg-Al-Zn alloy are iron 0.005 wt%, nickel 0.002
wt% and copper 0.03 wt% [23]. Unfortunately, for protective and decorative reasons,
electroless nickel plating and Cu-Ni-Cr plating are commonly used to cover the surfaces
of magnesium alloy products [24]. Also, since magnesium and aluminum closely
resemble each other, magnesium scraps may contain aluminum or steel inserts (Fe, Ni,
Cu and Si content) [25]. Therefore, most post-consumed or end-of-life magnesium
products are currently not recyclable, so resources are wasted [26].
7to electroless Ni plating) were remelted and molded. The chemical composition of the
recycled AZ91D magnesium ingot (in wt%) was 9.09 Al, 0.63 Zn, 0.24 Mn, 0.02 Si,
0.002 Fe, 0.015 Ni and 0.002 Cu, with the balance as Mg. The Ni content was about 10
times that of a qualified AZ91D magnesium ingot (maximum Ni content= 0.002 wt%
according to ASTM B93 specification). The sample used to generate H2 was machined
to suitable dimensions (100 mm in diameter and 100 mm high). Pt-coated Ti net (Fig. 1)
was adopted as a catalyst to promote the hydrolytic reaction of an Mg sample in aqueous
NaCl to evolve hydrogen. The dimensions of this catalyst were 80×80 mm2. The
cross-section of the Pt-coated Ti net was observed by FE-SEM (JOEL JSM-6700F
microscope) to study the thickness of the Pt film. Images were captured by
backscattered electron imaging. Based on Archimedes’s principle, the total weight of Pt
coated on the Ti net surface was measured using an analytical balance (sensitivity 0.1 mg,
GR-202, AND Co., Ltd).
Fig. 2 schematically depicts the experimental apparatus used to generate H2.
The Pt-coated Ti net was in contact with the top surface of the sample. The bottom of
the sample was fixed in a Pyrex reactor. The sample and the catalysts (Pt-coated Ti net)
were immersed in aqueous NaCl (5 wt% and pH= 8.27) in the Pyrex reactor. The initial
solution temperature was 20 °C ± 1 °C. An ultrasonic vibration machine with a cooling

4. Results and Discussion
Fig. 3 presents the cross-sectional of the Pt-coated Ti net catalyst used in this
work. As shown in Fig. 3, the Pt film was present continuously on the Ti surface. The
mean thickness of the Pt film was around 2.5 µm. The total weight of the Pt-coated
film on the Ti net (Fig. 1) was approximately 0.304 g. The volume of H2 generated in
the experiment in which the Pt-coated Ti net was statically loaded on the Mg sample
11
The Pt/Ti net catalyst was a cathode, and the Mg sample was an anode, so the corrosion
product formed and condensed on the anodic material surface. Therefore, as the
amount of Mg(OH)2 compound increased, the compound behaved more like an insulator
of the catalyst from the Mg sample surface. The generation of H2 was eventually
retarded, yielding the plateau-like region of the solid line in Fig. 4. A similar result has
been observed in the hydrolysis of NaBH4 solution with a Ru catalyst to evolve H2 [7].
In that experiment, the by-product NaBO2 was also formed and precipitated out of
solution, because of its limited solubility, blocking the sites of the catalyst and thereby
affecting the subsequent rate of H2 generation [7]. Mg and Mg-Ni powders that can be
used to produce H2 by hydrolysis in pure water and KCl aqueous solution have been
studied [9]. The hydrolysis of the powders to generate H2 can be interrupted by the
formation of the Mg(OH)2 layer on the surface of powder particles [9], since the passive
Mg(OH)2 layer on the surface of the Mg powder prevents further contact between the
water and the un-reacted Mg materials [9].
Fig. 6 shows the measured cumulative volume of H2 generated from 5 wt%
NaCl solution at 20 °C using the rotating-and-loading method. Instead of being
statically loaded, the Pt-coated Ti net catalyst was driven by a rotary motor (Fig. 2) at a
rotating speed of 8 ± 1 rpm. The loading normal force was 6 ± 0.5 kg. Fig. 6
13
sample can be determined by taking into account of the amount of H2 evolved. The
data form the rotating-and-loading method (Fig. 6) indicate that the total volume of H2
generated in 8100 sec was around 17755 ml. Therefore, the mass of the hydrolyzed Mg
was roughly 19.3 g. After the experiment by the loading-and-rotating method, the
cross-sectional microstructure of the Pt-coated Ti net was observed. As shown in Fig. 7,
the Pt-coated film on the grinding surface was slightly thinner than the film on the
original surface. A little of the Pt had been consumed (~ 0.0278 g).
The above results indicate that the rotating-and-loading method generated more
H2 than did the static loading method (Figs. 4 and 6). Fig. 8a and b schematically
depict the corrosion product Mg(OH)2 of H2 generation and the morphologies of the
corrosion products in relation to the motion of Pt-coated Ti net, to elucidate the
discrepancy between the amounts of H2 generated. During H2 generation, the Mg
sample and the Pt-coated Ti net catalyst was regarded as a galvanic couple of which the
Mg sample was the anode and the Pt-coated film was the cathode. As presented in Fig.
8a, Pt-coated Ti net statically pressed on an Mg sample produced H2. As the reaction
time increased, more Mg(OH)2 was formed on the sample surface. The Mg(OH)2
passive layer shown in black in Fig. 8a prevented further contact between the catalyst
(Pt/Ti net) and the un-reacted Mg sample. Hence, the cathodic H2 could not continue to

indicate the standard deviation of the experimental result. In another experiment of this
work, Pt/Ti net ground against surface of Mg sample to remove the Mg(OH)2 layer (see
Fig. 8b). Again, since the Pt/Ti net could not make a good contact with Mg sample
until the Mg(OH)2 was removed, the small variation of the Pt/Ti net rotating speed may
also influenced the removement of Mg(OH)2 layer on surface, thus affected the amount
of generated H2 volume. The error bars in Fig. 6 show the deviation of results from
those using the rotating-and-loading method.
5. Conclusion
The following conclusions can be drawn from the preceding results and
discussion.
1. End-of-life magnesium products scraps were remelted and molded. Although
contaminated by Ni, such scraps can be recycled as a secondary material for
generating high-purity H2. A Pt-coated Ti net was an effective catalyst, leading to
substantial effect on the reactivity of the Mg sample to hydrolysis in NaCl aqueous
solution.
2. When a Pt-coated Ti net was statically loaded on the Mg sample, the average H2
generation rate of about 302.3 ml min-1(g of catalyst)-1 was measured. The curve of
