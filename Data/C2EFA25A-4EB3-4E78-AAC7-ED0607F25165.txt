7Chapter 1 Introduction
In recent years, the industry of color imaging has been explored very fast. Digital cameras,
scanners, printers, liquid crystal displays (LCD), and projection displays are appeared everywhere
in our daily life. While consumers use these products, they are thinking why the quality of
displayed/printed color images is so much of difference. A high quality color is not only the
researchers want to achieve but also the general consumers too. In a color reproduction process,
there have already been many algorithms investigated to resolve reproduction problems and to
improve reproduction quality. These algorithms call Color Management Modules (CMMs) [5] in
terms of ICC (International Color Consortium) [5] expression. Usually it is needed to optimally
investigate a CMM for every particular condition. Therefore the aim of this research is to find an
optimal method which could be easily and efficiently used to integrate those CMMs already
developed and then to achieve high quality of color reproductions
The goal of this thesis is to find a method that colors can be processed using the most suitable
CMM and all systems can be easily integrated using distribution computing benefits. The exiting
standard techniques are combined together to form a new framework.
Image segmentation was used to separate colors to different categories that the different CMM can
process suitable color. We implement this method on color characterization to test and verify the
transformation quality. The K-means algorithm and 3X3 matrix based characterization method was
integrated and characterization quality was improved. Colors with different attributes need
different process methods (CMM) can be demonstrated by this example. The same method can be
extended to other applications.
9Chapter 2 Literature Review
2.1 Image Segmentation
Image segmentation is a technique that divides an image to several regions or objects where we are
interested in. A separated region usually contains the same property. Different from the
monochrome image, color image segmentation uses the color properties defined in a particular
color space to separate regions in an image. A color image is segmented in different color space
using the same algorithm to obtain different results according to features of different color spaces
[1].
2.1.1 Category of Segmentation methods
There are a lot of image segmentation algorithms which can be categorized as follows: (1) Pixel
based segmentation defines a region from image pixels which satisfy a function used to classify
pixels to the same class. Many techniques are used for this function, such as histogram
thresholding and clustering techniques. (2) Region based segmentation considers the continuity of
a region in an image. It is based on region growing, region splitting, and region merging
techniques. (3) Edge based segmentation is one of the earliest segmentation technique. This
method based on the edges found in an image using some techniques such as Sobel edge operator.
(4) Physics based segmentation is based on physical models which divide image into regions [2].
2.1.2 K-means Algorithm
K-means algorithm is a very popular clustering method for image segmentation. The goal of the
algorithm is to obtain a minimum distance which sum up the distances from all pixels to their
cluster centers. The number of cluster centers K must be determined first. Every pixel of an image

2.2 Color Management System
Nowadays, digital images are exchanged among different platforms and displayed/printed very
frequently on different devices via the Internet. Users prefer to have consistent and predictable
colors during the transformation between devices. Color management system (CMS) is an
application to control and adjust colors between different devices in cross media color
reproduction flow. So many hardware and software components are included to do device
calibration, colorimetric characterization, and data conversion processes. These components are
investigated by different researchers for high quality color image reproduction purpose. CMS is
constructed based on these components.
2.2.1 ICC-Based CMS
The International Color Consortium (ICC) proposed the standard for color management, which
defines the architecture, data structure, and cross-platform profile format in color management [5].
Over 60 members of ICC support this standard in their products. Actually, ICC standards are
widely used in most platforms and applications.
There are four basic components in ICC-based CMS: profile connection space (PCS), profile,
color management module (CMM) and rendering intents. These four components [6] are described
as follows.
2.2.1.1 PCS
The profile connection space is a key of CMS. PCS provides a bridge that you can connect any
device by different combination. In proprietary systems, devices using different color spaces, while
color images are transformed among numbers of devices, there are n2 transformations need to be
13
transform colors from input device color space to PCS or from PCS to the destination color space,
one reason to usethe CMM is to reduce the profile’s size [6].
2.2.1.4 Rendering Intents
When the destination device can’t reproduce the color of source devices, it is called out-of-gamut.
There are four methods. Which are called rendering intents: perceptual, saturation, relative
colorimetic and absolute colorimetric to deal with the out-of-gamut problems. The first two use
gamut compression method and the latter two uses the gamut clipping method [5].
2.2.2 Colorimetric Characterization
In a multiple input and output color image system, transforming device dependent colors to other
devices is a very complex task. Colorimetric characterization based on CIE standard is an efficient
system solution to simplify, standardize and specify the communications between devices. Each
input and output device must be colorimetric encoding appropriately to make color image data are
independent of any device [5].
Device characterization is to find a relationship between the device’s coordinates and the 
colorimetry’s color space. There are many methods to present the relationship between two color
spaces. In practical, the methods of physicals model (e.g. GOG [8]), numerical model and look-up
table (LUT) are usually used for different application purposes. Different models are corporate to
each other. For example, a method of numerical model can be used to find coefficients of matrix to
transform color data. Moreover look-up table is established by some numerical models for more
efficient color transformation.

2.3. Color Management Web Services System
2.3.1 Web Services System
Web services are defined by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [11]. They are software
component using Web-related protocol to provide services to other applications via the Internet.
Other systems interact with web services by Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages. In
service-oriented architecture, three roles: services requestor, service provider, and service registry,
and three operations: publishing, finding, and binding, are presented as shown in Figure.2. Service
provider is a CMM provider to provide CMM algorithms, and to publish service description to the
service registry. Service registry allows service requestors to find the service descriptions that are
published by service providers. Service requestor can be any consumer who finds a service
description from service registry, and binds the web services with service providers. Some of the
components used by this architecture are described as follows.

2.3.1.1 XML
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a flexible language, which represents data in many
17
2.3.1.3 SOAP
The goal of SOAP is to transform the information on the Internet by some extensible and simple
way. It is typically using HTTP protocol or other protocols such as FTP or SMTP to implement
SOAP. The workflow of SOAP is similar to the mailing system in the real world. A XML
document is put into an envelope, its messages encoded and decoded before and after
transformation, and the document is transformed to the destination through the Internet.
There are three components of SOAP: Envelope, Header and Body. SOAP Envelope defines the
start and the end of SOAP document. SOAP Header includes additional features of SOAP. SOAP
body consist the message of data [13].
2.3.1.4 UDDI
Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) provide a way that web services users
find the services. In the other word, UDDI is a directory of web services. Not only web services
users can find information of web services here but web services providers can add their service
information here. The principle of UDDI is similar to DNS (domain name service) that users can
find services at any host on the Internet [13].
2.3.2 CMWSS
Color Management Web Services System (CMWSS) [14] is based on CMS and web services
technique to achieve distributing computation on the Internet [14]. Follow the architecture of this
system, researchers can share investigations with each other, and a new research can be proved and
examined on a complete system at once. It doesn’t waste time to implement other CMS
components.

UML is able to construct a system by some thoughts of forward engineering functionality to obtain
UML diagrams from a system by some thought of reverse engineering functionality. UML defines
modeling rules and components by unified methods that different participators communicate each
other easily. During system development, many different participators may work together.
Different participators usually have different points of views in one system. Hence, UML uses
different diagrams for different purposes. There are nine different diagrams and five views in the
architecture of UML [15] as shown in Figure.4.

other word one transformation matrix may not accurate enough to transform all colors.
In our research, K-means algorithm is applied to segment the nonlinear issues with a selecting
color space. It is hoped that only homogeneous properties are remained in a particular segmented
region for further characterization. Therefore, in accordance with different regions, different
coefficients of different matrixes are obtained individually for better characterization.
3.1 Color Space Classification
Different color properties represent different color characteristics. Therefore, different color spaces
are developed to indicate certain color characteristics. For example, some color spaces may present
device dependent colors, and some color space may present device independent colors. Since good
and stable segmentation results are the purposes achieved in our research, some characteristics
have to match these purposes. According to our study, color spaces are classified by two
observations: (1) linear or nonlinear transformation from RGB color space; (2) lightness property
merged with chroma components or separated from chroma components.
For the first observation, the RGB color space is a fundamental color space to compose a color
image for displaying, and it is a basic color space to transform colors to/from other color spaces
[17]. To simplify different transformed methods from RGB color space, the transformed methods
are divided into linear transformation and nonlinear transformation.
For the second observation, some color spaces, such as RGB color space, whose color components
are highly correlated with each other, can’tdescribe human perceptual feelings. Lightness is one of
the most important components which orthogonal to other components in color perceptual.
Therefore, the separation of lightness and chroma is much useful to present human perceptual
23
lead to a large jump of the value of color components (e.g., CIELCH color space). During the
visual evaluation, the segmentation results of color spaces which are nonlinear transformed from
RGB sometimes are out of expectation in some particular portions of segmented images [1].
The color spaces used in our research which are linear transform from RGB color space are ATD,
RGB, I1I2I3, I1’I2’I3’, CIE RGB, CIE XYZ, YCC, YIQ, YUV, YCbCr and YES color spaces.
Hypothesis 2: The segmentation results in the color spaces which are separation of lightness
and chroma are better than the ones in the color spaces which are merge of lightness and
chroma
Although some color spaces are linear transformed from RGB such as the color spaces of RGB,
CIE RGB, CIE XYZ and CMY, usually they do not have unimaginable segmentation results [1].
The reason is due to the lack of effective color components for distance calculation by K-means
algorithm to make segmentation perfect.
Color spaces which separate lightness and chroma gain lower correlation of color components than
the ones merged together. Lightness is one of most important isolated attributes in color [17], as
well as the lightness is the most important attribute orthogonal to color features [20]. In most
image processing applications, the uncorrelated components are better for processing [17].
The color spaces which are linear transformed from RGB color space are taken to evaluate the
segmentation results differentiated by the lightness-chroma merged and the lightness-chroma
separated. The results show that the lightness and chroma separated color spaces usually are better
than the other ones [1]. In our research, the color spaces which are lightness and chroma separated

3.3 Device Characterization Evaluation Method
The color spaces are direct evaluated by the characterization results. The quality of device
characterization is evaluated by △E*ab (CIELAB Delta E) (See Appendix 2) between measured
color data and transformed color data. In Figure.7, the training data (RGB) are transformed to
device-independent color space (XYZ) using the corresponding matrix, and the △E*ab is
calculated with measured training data. In the other word the matrices are evaluated by the results
of △E*ab. The smaller the △E*ab the better performance of the matrices is appear.

Chapter 4 Systemic Describe Color Management
System for High Quality Color Reproduction
In this chapter, the most popular software modeling tool (UML) is used to describe CMS. Color
management system (CMS) using web service was introduced in [22] call color management web
service system (CMWSS) had already be modeled. A distribution computing CMS was present.
The color management module (CMMs) can be anywhere on the internet shared each other. A user
can compose these CMMs according transformation requirement. It can be said that particular
color attribute, image type, etc, transferred using the optimal algorithms based on CMWSS.
Image segmentation can be one of the CMMs separates these attributes, image types, etc of one
image. Digital image can be segmented to many different attributes parts, transformation using
different optimal algorithms through CMWSS. In our research, the refine UML diagrams were
presented and add the new segmentation concept.
4.1 What is High Quality Color Reproduction?
What is quality and how to define it? In different research fields have different view points and
explanation. In color science, the most direct way to evaluate the quality of color reproduction is to
see by human eye, because of human seen color. But this maybe one of the view point of color
quality. A high quality color reproduction must have an overall consideration about all color
reproduction components. In this section, we want to discussion this subject.
4.1.1 Human Acceptability
WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) is the objection of color reproduction. But it is
difficult to reproduction color exactly the same as the original. In practice, original color is
33
language (UML) to an open framework system. The components of system composed layer to lay
communication method. Hence, we call it layered-based. There are several benefits based on this
framework.
Hardware device connect to an operation system through the device driver which provided by
device manufacturers. Device driver can communication with device even process Analog/Digital
convert. Through the system APIs [26] provided by operating system, we can easily control device
hardware in operating system through device driver.
ICC based color management system provide CMMs API extended from system APIs that
applications can access profiles data and CMMs [26]. The International Color Consortium (ICC)
proposes the standard of color management workflow and definition the architecture, data stricture,
and cross-platform profile format in color management [5]. More over 60 members of ICC are
supported this standards in their product defined by ICC. Hence, ICC standards are widely used in
almost all platforms and applications.
Web services system establishes a distribution computing framework that the color applications
and CMMs can be easily combined, and shared each other on Internet. Based on this, the
efficientcy, productivity and transformation of color reproduction can be improved. Finally, we can
use UML to modeling all components in different UML view points, different user and researcher
will easy understand and communication with system.

color using the default profiles and basic CMMs according selected devices. Finally, user can
generate an output sRGB image display on monitor. Common mode includes image generator and
data transformation mode.
The advanced user using advanced mode to create private ICC profiles according upload color
information and transformation color by select exiting advanced CMMs. After transformation,
advanced users can generation analytical report using advanced mode to evaluation all
transformation. Analytical report may contain the E, standard derivation of E or any other△ △
color analyzes data, etc. Advanced mode includes the common mode.
The vendor mode used by hardware or software manufacturer to update their device profiles or
CMMs. Users can select profiles and CMMs provide by vendors to obtain the best color
transformation in their devices.
The research mode has function about CMMs. Researcher user using research mode to compose
all CMMs. They can add new CMMs (vendors function) to exiting system moreover. Research
mode also includes common mode, advanced mode and vendor mode [14] [19].

4.2.3 CMS Class Diagram
The class diagram shows the static design view point of CMS. Here we describe the dependency,
association and generalization relation in CMWSS components. See in Figure.16. In CMS view,
data transformation using CMMs in different combinations components, these components may
contains device characterization, color appearance models and gamut mapping. These components
have the common methods and attributes, hence, they extends from parents. For example,

component’s message interaction organization state. All the interactions are occurring with time.

Chapter 5 Conclusions
Our goal is to achieve high quality color reproduction using color management system. A high
quality color reproduction needs to integrate all procedure components with best combination. The
combination of best device characterization, best color appearance models and best gamut
mapping algorithm may not the best data transformation to all situations. The best quality color
transformation need to combination CMMs according what you want to application to. Because of
one algorithm usually design to specific situation. The web service system is a very suitable tool to
flexibility combination these components optimal in particular condition or color attribute. Using
above mentioned concept, image segmentation apply to the system and separate attributes to using
their optimal combination of CMMs by color spaces propose in this paper. Quality of reproduction
will be achieved using this method. This paper was described theses methods in Unified Modeling
Language (UML) methods in different view points.
K-means segmentation algorithm applies to CRT characterization using the matrices
transformation method is presented. The quality improvement in simply 3*3 matrix
characterization method is proved by the calculated CIE △E*ab. Seventeen color spaces are tested
in characterization to find that RGB, I1I2I3, and YCbCr color spaces are the best suitable one used
in K-means algorithms. We also propose the selection of color spaces must needed to consider the
linear transformation from RGB first, and then the lightness and chroma separation feature of color
spaces also an important factor.
UML on CMS refine from [14] [19] are described in this paper. We believe that forward and
reverse engineering about CMS need to be continuing processed to achieve more optimal system.
Different UML diagram are show in this paper. The new functions are added and modify parts of
