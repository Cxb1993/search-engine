ABSTRACT 
The supplier selection problem is typical of managerial problems involving tradeoffs among 
multiple largely qualitative criteria. This study applies the decision analysis approach of Berger et 
al. (2004) to design a visual basic for applications (VBA) program. A decision support system is 
used to determine the optimal number of suppliers. After determined the optimal number of 
suppliers, the next step is to put supply chain management into practice, that is, to choose the 
suitable cooperation partners. This study use the AHP approach to select the optimal supplier firm 
providing the most satisfaction for the criteria determined. In this study, 12 criteria have been 
identified for supplier selection and classified in four groups－price, quality, delivery, and 
technology. Further, this study designs a VBA program of the AHP approach. This system can 
help purchasing managers to select suppliers to maximize efficiency.

control, cash flow requirements, and product quality. The supplier selection problem is typical of 
managerial problems involving tradeoffs among multiple largely qualitative criteria. Recently, 
supply chain management and the supplier selection process has received considerable attention 
in the business management literature. 
This study reviews, annotates, and classifies 30 related articles [1-5, 7-11, 13-28, 30-34, 
and 40-42] which have appeared since 1966. To the extent that publication in the literature 
reflects interest in, and importance of, the various criteria, some observations may be made from 
this table. For example, Table 1 indicates that price, quality, delivery, technology, and service 
were discussed in 93, 90, 50, and 47% of the articles respectively. 
Table 1 Criteria discussed in annotated bibliography.

In summary, most of the articles referenced above suggest that managers perceive quality 
to be the important supplier attribute. The conceptual articles emphasize that managers should not 
select suppliers based on low cost only but should consider quality, delivery performance and 
other qualitative attributes. Thus, in this study, 12 criteria have been identified for supplier 
selection and classified in four groups－price, quality, delivery, and technology. 
The AHP developed by Thomas Saaty (1980), is a process that focuses on the choice phase 
of decision making. AHP helps decision makers structure complex decisions, develop measures 
of utility, and synthesize measures of both tangibles and intangibles with respect to numerous 
competing objectives inherent in almost any decision. What is immediately apparent in this 
extract is that the AHP is ideally suited for the supplier selection problem. Thus, this study use the 
AHP approach in electronic industry to help purchasing manager make supplier selection 
decision efficiency and design a VBA program of the AHP approach. 
 
3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
     Based on Berger et al. (2004), the decision tree approach is applied to derive formulate the 
optimal number of suppliers, as follows: 
 
)/(ln)]}1)(1(/[ln{1 * UUPLbn −−+<                 (1) 
 
Figure 2 AHP framework. 
 
A decision support system is used to determine the optimal number of suppliers. After 
determined the optimal number of suppliers, the next step is to put supply chain management into 
practice, that is, to choose the suitable cooperation partners. This study use the AHP approach to 
select the optimal supplier firm providing the most satisfaction for the criteria determined. In 
order to help purchasing manager to make the decision for achieving the maximize efficiency, 
this study design a VBA program of the AHP approach. 
In Fig. 3, by clicking the “optimal number of suppliers” button, it will be entry the interface 
of the system see Fig. 1. On the other hands, by clicking the “supplier selection by using AHP” 
button, it will be entry the interface of the system.

This study applies the analytic hierarchy process approach of Saaty (1980) to design a VBA 
program. Users have to enter their judgments only in the upper triangular half of the pair-wise 
comparison matrix see Fig. 4 and 5. The system also calculates the consistency of the buyer’s 
judgment in terms of the consistency ratio, which should normally be less then 10%. By clicking 
the “Next” button, it will be go to next level. In the final level, by clicking the “finish” button, 
users will know which supplier is the optimal.
