一、前言 
隨著資訊化時代來臨，全球產業結構已從早期的傳統工業演變為以科技產業
為主，其中電子產業蓬勃的發展已成為未來經濟發展的主流。然而在全球化市場
的競爭趨勢下，消費性電子、資訊產品之生命週期逐漸縮短，加速汰舊換新之速
度下產生極大量的電子電器廢棄物。根據歐盟統計資料(UNEP, 2005)，全球每年
約產生 2~5 千萬噸之電器及電子設備廢棄物，佔全球城市固體廢棄物之 5%。由
於廢電子電器及資訊相關衍生廢棄物數量之增加，以及使用材料的種類趨向複
雜，使得廢電子電器及資訊產品後續處理問題的難度更加提高。為因應這些問
題，歐盟訂定相關的電子電器及資訊產品法規命令如廢電子電機設備指令(Waste 
Electrical and Electronic Equipment, WEEE )、電子電機設備中危害物質禁用指令
(Restriction of the use of certain hazardous substance in EEE，ROHS)及能源使用產
品生態化設計指令(Eco-Design Requirements for Energy Using Products)等。 
    印刷電路板(printed circuit board，P-CB)是電子產品中不可或缺的重要組成，
隨著 WEEE 之快速增加，廢 P-CB 數量也逐年提升。由於 P-CB 為高分子聚合物
(樹脂)、玻璃纖維及多種金屬所構成的複合材料 (Wang et al., 2004)，特殊的物理
及化學特性使得資源化程序格外困難。目前針對廢電路板之資源化技術，以回收
具有經濟價值之金屬成分為主，而對於佔總重量約 80%以上之非金屬成分(如含
特殊添加劑之熱固性塑膠及玻璃纖維等)則多以焚化處理或直接掩埋 (Kinoshita 
et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003)。然而過去研究發現經由燃燒含阻燃劑廢棄物之過程
將導致持久性有機污染物生成，掩埋處理則可能導致重金屬溶出，而造成環境二
次污染。 
    有鑑於此，本研究以無毒性，無危害性之超臨界二氧化碳進行廢印刷電路板
中有機阻燃劑(氧化三苯膦，TPPO)之萃取，以便廢印刷電路板之回收處理。由
於超臨界二氧化碳屬非極性之流體，對於極性有機化合物(TPPO)之萃取效果有
其限制，故本研究以甲醇作為輔助劑(co-solvent)添加於超臨界二氧化碳溶劑中，
以便提升超臨界二氧化碳對 TPPO 之萃取能力 (Hawthorne, 1993)。此法可有效提
高有機物之萃取率，並降低處理過程中所產生之有害氣體污染物，故於降低環境
負荷與促進資源循環之前提下，可望發展成為環境友善、低能耗及高效率之資源
化技術。

界二氧化碳之極性，進而提高 TPPO 於超臨界二氧化碳之溶解度(Santos et al., 
1998; Altwaiq et al., 2003)。此外，實驗結果證實溫度提高對 TPPO 萃取率有顯著
影響，當溫度為 300°C 且添加 10%甲醇時，TPPO 萃取率可達 96%。因此，本研

high population density and limited landfills. About 24 large-scale MSWIs have been in 
operation in Taiwan. In contrast with other countries, MSWIs in Taiwan are larger and newer 
with only six of those started operation before 1999.7 Although the PCDD/F emission limit of 
large scale MSWIs (0.1 ng I-TEQ Nm-3) is among the most stringent in the world and the 
PCDD/F concentrations emitted from the MSWIs have been quite low, the influence of PCDD/F 
emission from MSWIs on ambient air is still a public concern.  
 
Atmosphere is a major medium for the transport of PCDD/Fs from combustion sources to 
terrestrial and aquatic environments.8-9 Considering the potential variability and concentrations of 
PCDD/F emission in ambient air, average atmospheric levels are not necessarily the most 
adequate monitor for PCDD/Fs. For the above reason, soil and vegetation matrices located in the 
vicinity of the emission source have been used in the environmental monitoring of MSWIs.10-12 
Evaluation of PCDD/F concentrations in vegetation can produce information on short-term 
exposure to these compounds.10 Recently, several investigations have been conducted in the 
vicinity of MSWIs in Italy, German, Spain, Portugal, Korea, China, and Taiwan.6, 11-18  
 
To the best of our knowledge, impacts and contributions of MSWIs to the vicinity 
environments were still unclear. Accordingly, approaches adopted for source identification and 
source apportionment in the vicinity of the MSWI were reported in this study. The distribution of 
PCDD/Fs in the different media in the vicinity of a MSWI in rural area of southern Taiwan was 
determined. The significance of the emission sources near the MSWI to the PCDD/F 
concentrations of the ambient air was evaluated through the use of statistical analyses. In 
addition, contributions of the MSWI to the vicinity atmospheric environments were conducted 
based on the modeling of Industrial Source Complex Short Term modeling (ISCST).  
 
OVERVIEW 
 
The main objective of this study was to verify environmental impacts of the MSWI and to 
quantity the contribution to the ambient PCDD/F from various sources. A total of 24 
environmental samples (air, soil, and vegetative samples) were collected at four sites near the 
MSWIs located in southern Taiwan during July 2009 and December 2009. The PCDD/F 
congener profiles of all samples together with that obtained from several stationary emission 
sources and two mobile emission sources were analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA) 
and the cluster analysis. The chemical mass balance (CMB) model was adopted to assess the 
contributions of possible PCDD/Fs and, particularly, the MSWI on the ambient air.

PCDD/F sampling 
 
A total of 24 environmental samples were collected at four sites twice separately, during 
summer (July 2009) and winter periods (December 2009). Sampling meteorological information 
is shown in Table 2. In each sampling period, four ambient air, four soil and four vegetative 
samples were collected. PCDD/F concentrations in ambient air samples were collected using a 
PS-1 sampler (Graseby Anderson, GA, USA), following the revised U.S. EPA Method TO9A.22 
Each sample was collected continuously on three consecutive days, yielding a sampling volume 
of about 972 m3. The PS-1 sampler was equipped with a quartz fiber filter for sampling 
particle-phase compounds, and a glass cartridge that contained PUF for sampling gas-phase ones. 
Prior to sampling, a known amount of surrogate standard (SS) was spiked to check the collection 
efficiency of the sampling train. The recoveries of the PCDD/Fs surrogate standards were 
98–123%, falling within the required 70–130%.

profiles are linearly independent. The basic idea in the CMB model is that the measured 
concentrations of receptor chemicals (in this study; seventeen 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/F 
congeners) are the sum of contributions from several sources.24-26 Prior to analysis, it was 
assumed that atmospheric degradation of PCDD/Fs can be neglected due to the long half-lives of 
PCDD/F congeners and short distances between the sampling sites and the sources (around 2 to 
10 km). All ambient concentrations after sensitivity analysis and source profiles adopted in PCA 
were used in CMB analysis to estimate source contributions.  
 
Results and Discussion 
 
PCDD/F concentration in different media 
 
PCDD/F concentrations or contents in the ambient air, soil, and banyan leaves are listed in 
Table 3. To assess the toxicologically relevant information on PCDD/Fs, the I-TEQ values for 
PCDD/Fs were calculated by using the contents of seventeen 2,3,7,8-chlorinated congeners and 
their International Toxicity Equivalency Factors (I-TEFs). The means of total PCDD/F and total 
I-TEQ contents (summation of 17 individual PCDD/Fs and TEQs) in the ambient air were 0.254 
pg/Nm3 and 0.0214 pg I-TEQ/Nm3 in summer, respectively, while those were 0.898 pg/Nm3 and 
0.0548 pg I-TEQ/Nm3 in winter, respectively. The observed values were much lower than the 
Japanese ambient air quality standard (JAQS) of 0.6 pg I-TEQ/Nm3 for PCDD/Fs.27 The above 
results revealed that the atmospheric concentrations were similar to the results of Shih et al.,17 
which indicated that total atmospheric concentrations collected from rural area in southern 
Taiwan were 0.027, 0.016, 0.024, 0.063 pg I-TEQ/Nm3 in spring, summer, fall and winter, 
respectively. The PCDD/F values are within the range of 0.0319-0.0847 pg I-TEQ/Nm3 that 
detected in the vicinity of two MSWIs in southern Taiwan,18 but slightly higher than those of the 
rural areas in Taiwan (0.029 pg I-TEQ/Nm3 ).19  
 
When compared with worldwide levels, the PCDD/F I-TEQ concentrations observed in this 
study are comparable to those of the rural area in Germany (0.025-0.070 pg I-TEQ/Nm3)13 and in 
Spain (0.050 pg I-TEQ/Nm3).28 In addition, PCDD/F I-TEQ concentrations found in this study 
are in the low range of those analyzed in the vicinity of MSWI in Porto, Lisbon, and Madeira, 
Portugal (0.130 pg I-TEQ m-3 )14 and in Bucheon, Korea (0.22-1.16 pg I-TEQ m-3 ).12 As can be 
seen from the atmospheric concentrations between the two seasons, the total PCDD/F and I-TEQ 
concentration in winter were 3.5 and 2.6 times higher than in summer, respectively. The trend 
that PCDD/F concentration in winter was higher than in summer has been found in previous 
studies.12,17,19,29 It has been reported that the atmospheric PCDD/F concentrations varied with the 
seasons because of several loss process including photolysis, chemical reactivity, wet and dry 
deposition, and scavenging by vegetation.30-31  
 
In general, banyan is widely grown in the neighborhood of the MSWI and in Taiwan; the 
PCDD/F contents of its leaves were explored as an indicator of the atmospheric emissions of 
PCDD/Fs in this study. The mean total PCDD/F contents in banyan leaves were 16.6 and 24.0 
ng/kg in summer and in winter, respectively, while the corresponding I-TEQ contents were 1.54 
and 2.82 ng I-TEQ/kg in summer and in winter, respectively (Table 3). No significant differences 
among the seasons and sampling sites were found in this study, reflecting the similarity of the 
emission sources of PCDD/Fs (industrial activities, traffic, etc.).
8 
 
Results presented that the mean I-TEQ content of 2.18 ng I-TEQ/kg in the observed banyan 
leaves was lower than the previous findings detected from banyan leaves near the MSWI in 
northern Taiwan (1.29-9.06 ng I-TEQ/kg)20 and was also lower than that of pine needles of urban 
areas in Korea (5.5 ng I-TEQ/kg).32 To further evaluate the environmental impact of the MSWI 
and to verify the atmospheric and vegetative findings, the PCDD/F concentrations were 
determined in soils taken in the vicinity of the MSWI. The means of total PCDD/F and total 
I-TEQ contents in the soil were 122 ng/kg and 0.618 ng I-TEQ/kg in summer, respectively, while 
those were 126 ng/kg and 0.838 ng I-TEQ/kg in winter, respectively (Table 3). No significant 
variation in the concentrations of PCDD/Fs in soil sample was observed even with the season 
and sampling site variations. By comparing the above total PCDD/Fs I-TEQ with those of the 
MSWIs in Taiwan (ranged from 1.90 to 3.03 ng I-TEQ/kg),16 the slightly lower PCDD/F levels 
were observed in the investigation. In addition, these observes PCDD/F concentrations 
(0.293-1.24 ng I-TEQ/kg) were lower than those found in soil samples collected near MSWIs in 
Korea (1.25-74.98 ng I-TEQ/kg)12 and in Spain (0.11-34.28 ng I-TEQ/kg),11,15 while they are 
consistent with those found in Italy (0.08-1.5 ng I-TEQ/kg).6  
 
PCDD/F congener profiles 
 
The congener profiles of the seventeen 2,3,7,8 chlorinated substituted PCDD/Fs (mean ± SD) 
detected in different media are shown in Figure 2. The profiles were calculated according to the 
fraction (%) of each congener to total PCDD/F mass concentration. Similar PCDD/F congener 
profiles were observed in eight ambient air samples (n=8) (Figure 2a). OCDD was the dominant 
congener, followed by 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF, OCDF, and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD, which are 
consistent with those found in other studies.9,16,17,20,28 However, the PCDD/F congener profiles 
obtained in this study are different from those in rural and remote areas of the United States,33 in 
which the PCDD/F patterns were a consequence of the atmospheric weathering effect.

variance, while factor 2 explains 16.3% of the total variance and together account for 73.1% of 
the total variance. The score plot reveals that the data points were clustered into three groups as 
marked on the PCA plot. Group 1 contains eight ambient air samples collected during two 
seasons, two mobile emission sources (unleaded gasoline fuel vehicles/diesel fuel vehicles,  
UGFV/DFV) and several stationary emission sources (CM, MWI, and MS). Group 2 consists of 
eight banyan leaves and the total of eight soil samples were assembled to Group 3. The data 
points of ambient air samples and the MSWI were located apart from each other due to their 
divergent patterns. The above results indicated that the ambient air of four sites might be affected 
by MWI, CM, MS, UGFV, and DFV, but the influence of MSWI is not obvious. Results from 
PCA shows that PCDD/Fs congener distribution in air, banyan leaves, and soils were classified 
in separate categories, revealing that three investigated media might be affected by different 
sources.  
 
The result of cluster analysis was similar to that of PCA (Figure 3b). The data points of 
ambient air collected from four sites clustered first with those of UGFV/DFV and then with 
MWI, CM, and open burning (OB). Previous studies have shown that PCDD/F emissions from 
crematories, UGFV/DFV, and joss paper (semi-open systems) did significantly affect the 
surrounding environment.7,26,35 Consequently, ambient air samples were influenced significantly 
by mobile sources, open burning, and several stationary emission sources (MWI, CM, and MS) 
on the ambient air was significant; however, the effect of the MSWI on ambient air quality was 
insignificant.

PCDD/F sources. However, the MSWI again did not have significant PCDD/F contributions on 
the ambient atmosphere. 
 
 
 
 
 
Contributions of the MSWI to the vicinity atmospheric environments 
 
Based on the PCDD/F concentration of the stack flue gases of the MSWI (an average of 
0.036 ng I-TEQ/Nm3), the atmospheric maximum hourly PCDD/F concentrations at the four 
sampling sites were obtained by the ISCST model. Table 4 shows the measured PCDD/F 
concentrations and the ISCST-modeled PCDD/F concentrations. It can be seen that the modeled 
average and maximum contributions of the MSWI to the ambient atmospheric PCDD/F 
concentrations were quite limited, ranging from 0.928 to 2.87% (average value of 1.89%). 
Results of ISCST modeling also verify that more than 97% of atmospheric PCDD/Fs found at 
sampling sites were contributed by other sources. These findings reinforced our previous 
inference that the MSWI was not the most suspected PCDD/F source in the study area, and other 
emission sources of PCDD/Fs could be of great significance.

SUMMARY 
 
This study set out to verify environmental impacts of the MSWI and to quantity the 
contribution to the ambient PCDD/F from various sources. From the total PCDD/F levels of 
ambient air, banyan leaves, and soil samples taken at four sites in the vicinity of the MSWI, it 
has been found that the influence of the MSWI on the environment was insignificant. In PCA
