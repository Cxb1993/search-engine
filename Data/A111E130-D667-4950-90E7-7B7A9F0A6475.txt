Abstract 
The Ritz method has been frequently applied to study vibration behaviors of a structure. 
The efficiency of the numerical solution mainly depends on the appropriately chosen admissible 
functions. Plate as an important structural component may have an internal crack due to 
overloaded condition, fatigue, or material defect. Consequently, from a practical point of view, it 
is needed to investigate the vibration behaviors of a plate with an internal crack.  
It is very scarce to find the invetigations of applying the Ritz method to study the vibration 
behaviors of a plate with an internal crack in the literature. The main reason is that it is very 
difficult to establish a set of admissible functions suitable for that type of problems, and there is 
no a systematic procedure to develop such admissible functions. The main purpose of this study 
is to develop a systematic procedure of establishing admissible functions for a plate with an 
internal crack, according to different plate theories.  
Three theories are employed to model the behaviors of a plate, namely classical thin plate 
theory, Mindlin plate theory and three-dimensional elasticity theory. To obtain accurate 
numerical solutions, sets of crack functions are proposed as the admissible functions in the Ritz 
method based on different plate theories to properly account for the singularity behaviors in the 
neighborhood of the crack tip and to elucidate the discontinuities of displacements or slopes 
across the crack. 
The validity and correctness of the proposed solutions are confirmed by comprehensive 
convergence studies and comparison with the published results. The proposed methodology is 
further applied to investigate the effects of the length, position, and inclination angle of crack on 
the vibration frequencies of rectangular cracked plates having various thickness ratios and 
boundary conditions. Accurate frequencies are tabulated and some corresponding nodal patterns 
are also shown for the first five modes. The results shown are the first ones available in the 
published literature. These data can be used as standard to judge the accuracy of other numerical 
methods and various plate theories.

Several experiment works on vibrations of thin, cracked plates were reported. Maruyama 
and Ichinomiya (1989) employed the real-time technique of time averaged holographic 
interferometry to determine the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of 
clamped rectangular thin plates with straight cracks. Ma and Huang (2001) and Ma and Hsieh 
(2001) utilized the amplitude fluctuation electronic speckle pattern interferometry to 
determine the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of cantilevered rectangular 
thin plates with horizontal or vertical side cracks.  
Very little published research is available about the vibrations of thick, cracked plates. 
Based on the simplified Reissner theory, Lee and Lim (1993) used the Ritz method with a 
domain decomposition technique to determine the fundamental frequencies of center-cracked 
rectangular plates with simply support conditions. 
Since the Ritz method (Ritz, 1908) was proposed in 1908, it has become a popular 
method on analyzing vibrations of plates because of its high efficiency in yielding accurate 
solutions. There are hundreds of published papers applying the Ritz method to determine 
natural frequencies of plates with various shapes and boundary conditions in the monograph 
of Leissa (1969) and review papers (Leissa, 1977a, 1977b, 1981a, 1981b, 1987a, 1987b; 
Liew et al., 1995). However, as reviewed above, there are very few works devoted to 
problems of plates with internal cracks, which can be due to the difficulties on developing 
good admissible functions for such problems. It is well-known that the success of the Ritz 
method in accurately solving vibration problems mainly depends on using appropriate 
admissible functions. Appropriate admissible functions for plates with internal cracks should 
not only properly describe the stress singularity behaviors at the neighborhood of the crack 
tips, but also meet the discontinuities of displacement and slopes across cracks.

Chapter two present the studies of thin plates based on the classical plate theory, while 
chapter three investigates the vibrations of cracked Mindlin plates. Chapter four extends the 
previous studies to cracked rectangular parallelepipeds of functionally graded material based 
on three-dimensional elasticity theory. Then, conclusions and recommendation for further 
research are given in chapter five.

are obtained by minimizing the energy functional

The admissible functions for representing W  in Eqs. (2.1) must satisfy the geometric (i.e., 
essential) boundary conditions of the problem under consideration. For a rectangular plate 
with an internal crack, the admissible functions for the transverse displacement are assumed 
here as the sum of two sets of functions: 
cp WWW += ,  (2.3) 
where pW  is a set of algebraic polynomials which forms a mathematically complete set of 
functions if an infinite number of terms are used; cW  is used to supplement pW  by 
appropriately describing the important behavior along the crack.  
Orthogonal polynomials are used for pW , and pW  is expressed as

geometrical boundary conditions of the rectangular plate. Notably, using orthogonal 
polynomials results in less ill-conditioning of the matrix than using regular polynomials.

The functions ),,(ˆ , iinAn rw θλ  and ),,(ˆ , iinSn rw θλ  in Eqs. (2.6) are the well known 
original corner functions developed according to Williams’ solutions (Williams,1952). These 
original corner functions satisfy the static governing equation for a thin plate without loading 
and the free boundary conditions along the crack, and appropriately describe the stress 
singularity behaviors at crack tip i (see Fig. 2.1). The subscripts A and S denote 
anti-symmetric and symmetric functions with respect to 0=iθ , respectively. The coordinates

2.2 Convergence Studies 
Since cracked square plates with simple support boundary conditions were often studied 
in the published literature, convergence studies were carried out for such plates with different 
crack lengths to verify the correctness of the solutions and demonstrate the effects of cW  on 
the solutions. In Eq. (2.5) qpml  and , , ,  are set equal one to satisfy the geometric boundary 
conditions (zero transverse displacement) along simply supported edges. Numerical results 
are presented for the first five nondimensional frequency parameters D/ha ρω 2 , which 
are commonly used in the plate vibration literature, of plates having centrally located cracks 
( 5.0/ and 5.0/ 00 == byax ) with different crack lengths (d /a = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8) and 
inclination angles ( =α 0o and 45o). Poisson’s ratio equal to 0.3 is used for all the results 
shown here.  
Shown in Tables 2.1 to 2.3 are the convergence studies of nondimensional frequency 
parameters for horizontally cracked plates with length d /a =0.2, 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. The 
middle point of the crack coincides with the center of plate. In the first column of these tables 
parenthesized S and A denote symmetric and anti-symmetric mode shapes, respectively, with 
respect to the line of crack. The present solutions did not take advantage of the symmetry of 
the problem. That is, the solutions for symmetric and anti-symmetric modes were not 
separately considered. The published results by Stahl and Keer (1972) and Liew e t a l. (1994) 
are also listed for comparison. It should be noted that although Stahl and Keer (1972) used a 
very accurate Fredholm integration approach, they admitted that the fourth significant figure 
of their results for the higher modes may not be accurate because of the numerical techniques 
used in determining the natural frequencies. Liew e t a l. (1994) decomposed the plate under 
consideration into three sub-domains and used 19×9 terms of orthogonal polynomials for 
each sub-domain to construct the solutions for symmetric and anti-symmetric modes, 
respectively. As mentioned in chapter one, the solutions of Liew e t a l. (1994) are not 
guaranteed to be the upper bounds on exact natural frequencies.    
 12 
e t a l. are less than those of Stahl and Keer, another indication that the solutions of Liew e t a l. 
are not guaranteed to be upper bounds on the exact frequencies. 
It should be specially mentioned that the present results were obtained by using 
== κκ 1.5 in Eqs. (2.6). Convergence studies not shown here were also carried out for the 
plates considered in Tables 2.1 and 2.3 but using == κκ 2.5, where it was revealed that the 
solutions are not sensitive to the values of κκ  and .  
To investigate the effects of crack inclination and boundary conditions of the plate on the 
convergence of the present solutions, Table 2.4 summarizes the convergence studies of 
nondimensional frequency parameters for a simply supported square plate with an inclined 
crack (α=45o) having length d /a =0.5, while Table 2.5 shows the convergence study for a 
completely free square plate with a horizontal crack having length d /a =0.5. The middle point 
of the crack coincides with the center of plate. Notably, there are three rigid body modes for a 
complete free plate, having zero frequencies, which are not shown in Table 2.5. Comparing 
these data with those in Table 2.2, one finds that the convergence rates of frequencies with 
increased number of modified corner functions in the admissible functions are different for 
the results in these three tables. However, using I=J=9 and N = 15 (totally 141 terms) in the 
admissible functions still gives at least three significant figure convergence for the first five 
nonzero frequencies in each case.    
2.3 Frequencies and Mode Shapes 
Based on the convergence studies given in the previous section, I=J=9 and N = 10 (totally 
121 terms) and I=J=9 and N = 15 (totally 141 terms) in the admissible functions were 
employed to determine the first five nonzero frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of 
square cracked plates having crack length d /a ≤0.3 and d /a ≥0.4, respectively. Tables 2.6 and 
2.7, respectively, list the nondimensional frequency parameters for simply supported and 
completely free square plates having internal cracks with various lengths (d /a =0.1, 
0.2,…,0.6), different inclination angles (α=0o, 15o, 30o, and 45o), and different locations 
 14 
the vibration mode shapes are still either symmetric or anti-symmetric to the axes. This is 
observed in the nodal patterns (lines of zero vibration displacement) shown in Figs. 2.2 and 
2.3 when α =0o or 45o. When α =0o and d /a =0.2 (a small horizontal crack), the small crack 
only cause the fifth mode shape significantly different from that for an intact plate with 
simply support conditions; and similar observation is found for the second modes for 
completely free plates. As the crack is getting large (d /a =0.6), more significant changes are 
revealed for such modes as well as for the third and fourth modes for completely free cracked 
plates. Adding an inclined crack with α =45o to an intact plate leads to substantial changes of 
modal shapes in the forth and fifth modes with simple support boundary conditions and in the 
first mode for completely free boundary conditions.  
When a horizontal crack is not on the symmetry axis of the plate but its middle point is, 
the mode shapes of the cracked plate are either symmetric or anti-symmetric to the symmetry 
axis perpendicular to the crack. This is found in Figs. 2.2 and 2.3 when α =0o and 
)/ ,/( 00 byax = (0.5, 0.75). The existence of the crack causes significant changes in the mode 
shapes of the symmetric modes from those for an intact plate.   
When a crack completely destroys the symmetry of plate, the crack causes considerable 
changes in all mode shapes from those for an intact plate, which is seen in Figs. 2.2 and 2.3 
when α =15o. When the crack length becomes larger, the changes in mode shapes become 
more significant.

simply called crack functions in the following.

 But, it is complicated to introduce the asymptotic solutions given in Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) 
into the admissible functions. Instead, the following, much less complicated, set of crack

where functions ),( yxg k  are inserted to satisfy the geometric boundary conditions along 
the edges of a rectangular plate. 
When plates with internal cracks (Fig. 3.1) are under consideration, Eq.(3.8) is not 
suitable for the admissible functions. There are two crack tips, so one needs admissible 
functions that can properly describe the singularity behaviors around both tips. Hence, the 
following admissible functions are proposed:  
 20 
1_1kN , 2_1kN , 1_2kN , and 2_2kN  (k=1, 2, 3) in Eq. (3.9) equal to N . Then, one obtains 
3IJ+6 N ( N +3) linear algebraic equations for those coefficients to be determined, and an 
eigenvalue (frequency) determinant of this same order. 
3.2 Convergence studies 
The Ritz method always gives upper bounds on vibration frequencies, and these 
upper-bound solutions converge to the exact solution as the number of appropriate admissible 
functions increases sufficiently. This important feature provides an excellent way to verify the 
correctness of the proposed solutions. Convergence studies of side-cracked and 
internal-cracked rectangular plates were carried out herein to confirm the accuracy of the 
present solutions. Poisson’s ratio for the plate material is set equal 0.3 for all the results 
shown here. 
In the present section and the following section, simply supported and cantilevered plates 
are under investigation. The geometric boundary conditions for a simply supported plate are  
 0,0)(x =xψ , 0),(x =bxψ , 0y),0(y =ψ , 0y),(y =aψ , 
0,0)( =xw , 0),( =bxw , 0y),0( =w , 0y),( =aw . (3.10) 
Accordingly, to make the admissible functions in Eq.(3.8) satisfy the geometric boundary 
conditions of simple support, the following ),( yxg k  (k=1, 2, 3) are simply used: 
)(),(1 ybyyxg −= , )(),(2 xaxyxg −= , and ))((),(3 ybxax yyxg −−= . (3.11) 
The cantilevered plates are clamped at the edge with x=0, and ),( yxg k  (k=1, 2, 3) are set as 
xyxg k =),( . 
3.2.1 Side-cracked plates 
  Tables 3.1 presents the convergence studies of a simply supported rectangular thin plate 
(a /b =2 and h /b =0.01) having a horizontal side crack at c y  /b = 0 .5  with a length of d /a = 0 .5  
(Fig. 3.1a), while Table 3.2 shows the convergence studies of a plate with the same geometry 
as that in Table 3.1 except for h /b =0.1. The convergence properties for the first five 
 22 
classical plate theory, which ignores the shear deformation and rotary inertia of the plate. 
Comparison of Tables 3.1 and 3.2 finds that the convergence rate of the results for a 
moderately thick plate (Table 3.2) is slightly better than that for a thin plate (Table 3.1).  
3.2.2 Internal-cracked plates 
Tables 3.3 and 3.4 summarize the convergence studies of the first five non-dimensional 
frequency parameters, Dha /2 ρω , for square plates having centrally located horizontal internal 
cracks (  ,5.0/0 =ax   5.0/0 =by  and 
ο0=α ) with d /a = 0 .6 . Table 3.3 considers a thin 
plate (h /b =0.01) with simple supports, while Table 4 is for a thick plate (h /b =0.1) with 
cantilevered boundary conditions. The results are obtained using 5×5, 6×6,…, 10×10 
orthogonal polynomials in conjunction with sets of crack functions with N = 0, 1, 2, 3,…, 8 
in Eqs. (3.9) for each of xψ , yψ  and w .  
As observed in the convergence studies for side-cracked plates, adding the crack 
functions in Eqs. (3.9) into the admissible functions considerably enhances the accuracy of 
the numerical solutions. The numerical results monotonically converge from the upper 
bounds as the number of polynomials and crack functions increases. The excellent agreement 
between the convergent results and the results of Stahl and Keer (1972) in Table 3.3 
demonstrates the validity of the present solutions for plates with internal cracks. Using 
polynomials with I  and J  larger than 8 and crack functions with N  larger than 6 gives 
results which are exact to at least 3 significant figures.  
3.3 Frequencies and Mode Shapes 
After the correctness and accuracy of the proposed approach was verified by performing 
the convergence studies, this approach was further applied to study the effects of location, 
length and orientation of cracks on the free vibration frequencies and mode shapes of simply 
supported and cantilevered rectangular plates. Only plates with h /b =0.1 are considered herein. 
 
 24 
dashed lines denote the nodal lines where transverse displacement equals zero, and solid lines 
represent non-zero contours. The crack destroys the symmetry of plate with respect to the 
horizontal line passing the center of the plate. Therefore, the nodal lines for the cracked plates 
are no longer symmetric to the horizontal line. Nevertheless, the nodal lines for a simply 
supported plate with a vertical crack at c x /a =0.5 are still symmetric with respect to the 
vertical line including the crack. The nodal patterns for the higher modes (i.e., the fourth and 
fifth modes) are rather sensitive to the location, length and orientation of the crack.  
 
3.3.2 Internal-cracked square plates 
Table 3.7 presents the first five nondimensional frequency parameters Dha /2 ρω  for 
simply supported square plates with centrally located cracks of various lengths (d /b =0.1, 
0.2,…, 0.6) and orientations ( =α 0o, 15o, 30o and 45o) (Fig. 2.1), while Table 3.8 shows the 
results for cantilevered square plates. The results for plates with crack length ≤bd / 0.3 were 
obtained using polynomials with 8×8 terms and crack functions with 5=N  in Eqs. (3.9) 
yielding a total of 432 degrees of freedom; the results for ≥bd / 0.4 were obtained using 
polynomials with 8×8 terms and crack functions with 6=N  in Eqs. (3.9) resulting in a total 
of 516 degrees of freedom. The frequencies of intact plates (i.e., bd / =0) were obtained 
using only orthogonal polynomials with I=J=10. The frequencies are exact to at least three 
significant figures. 
Increasing the crack length reduces the frequency of each mode. The frequencies of the 
third mode in Table 3.7 are less sensitive to the crack length than the other modes, and the 
reduction in frequency is less than 5% even when the crack length bd / =0.6. The frequencies 
of the fourth mode in Table 3.8 are affected the most by the crack length among the first five 
modes. A small crack (d /b =0.1) reduces the frequencies of the first four modes for simply 
supported cracked plates and the frequencies of the first five modes for cantilevered cracked 
plates by only less than 1.1%. Changing the crack orientation from ο0=α , ο15 , ο30 , and to

Three-Dimensional Vibrations of Functionally Graded Material  
Rectangular Cracked Plates  
Laminated composite materials have been successfully utilized in engineering systems, 
particularly in aircraft and aerospace structures, primarily because they have excellent 
strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. Nevertheless, the abrupt change in material 
properties across the interface between material layers can produce large interlaminar stresses 
and cause delaminations. Recently, functionally graded materials (FGMs), which are 
heterogeneous composite materials and whose material properties vary continuously with a 
change in the volume fraction of its constituents, have been invented to overcome the 
disadvantages of conventional laminated composite materials. These have found various 
applications in various engineering fields. Functionally graded materials can be designed to 
have high resistance to temperature gradients, significant reduction in residual and thermal 
stresses, and high wear resistance. 
Although the amount of research works on vibrations of homogenous rectangular plates 
are huge, a number of studies are available for FGM rectangular plates based on various plate 
theories. Abrate (2008) and Zhang and Zhou (2008) demonstrated that a FGM thin plate 
behaves like a homogeneous plate if a proper reference plane is chosen in the classical thin 
plate theory. Based on the first-order shear deformation plate theory, Hosseini-Hashemi (2010) 
presented analytical solutions for vibrations of a rectangular plate simply supported at its two 
opposite edges and lying on either Winkler or Pasternak elastic foundations, and Zhao et al. 
(2009) analyzed vibrations of square and skew plates with different combinations of 
boundary conditions using the element-free kp-Ritz method. Ferreira et al. (2006) determined 
vibration frequencies of square plates employing the first-order, third-order shear deformation 
plate theories and the collocation method with multiquadric radial basis functions. Using 
higher-order shear deformation plate theory, Qian et al. (2004) applied the Petrov–Galerkin 
 28 
thickness-to-length ratios, different combinations of boundary conditions, and having internal 
cracks of various crack lengths, positions, and angles of inclination. The effects of the volume 
fraction in a power law for describing the material properties of FGM on the vibration 
frequencies are also examined. The relevant results are presented in tables and figures as 
references for future research. 
4.1 Geometric configuration and model of material properties  
Figure 4.1 displays a rectangular FGM plate (of length a , width b  and thickness h ) with an 
internal crack and also shows the rectangular coordinate (x , y , z) originating at the mid-plane 
of the plate.  Two polar coordinates (r 1, 1θ ) and (r 2, 2θ ) originating at the two crack tips on 
the mid-plane, respectively, are also given to describe the stress singularities as r 1 and r 2 
approach zero. The configuration of the internal crack is defined by the mid-point of the 
crack in the mid-plane of the plate 0 0( , )x y , the angle of inclination α , and the length of the 
crack, d .  
The functionally graded material of interest is a mixture of metal and ceramics. The 
material properties (elastic modulus, E  =  E (z), Poisson’s ratio, υ  = υ (z), and mass density, 
ρ = ρ(z)) vary throughout the thickness of the plate in a manner determined by the volume 
fractions of the constituents. A power-law describes the variation of material properties in z  
direction:

where P  denotes a property of the material; tP  and bP  represent the properties at the top (z  
= h /2) and the bottom (z  = -h /2) faces, respectively, and m  is the parameter of volume 
fraction that governs the material variation profile in the thickness direction. The FGM plates 
considered herein are made of aluminum (Al) and ceramic (alumina (Al2O3)), whose material 
properties are given in Table 4.1.

where ipUˆ are expressed in terms of a set of polynomial functions, which form a 
mathematically complete set if an infinite number of terms are used; icUˆ  are expressed in 
terms of a set of special functions to supplement the polynomials to describe appropriately 
the essential singular stresses at the crack front and displacement discontinuities across the 
crack. 
A Gram-Schmidt process, proposed by Bhat (1985), is applied to construct orthogonal 
polynomials in the x  and y  directions, denoted by )()( xP ij and )(

Notably, )()( xP ij  satisfy the geometric boundary conditions for U i  on the faces of the 
plate, x=0 and x=a , while )()( yQ ik  satisfy the geometric boundary conditions for U i  on the  
faces, y=0 and y=b . In Eq. (4.6), ordinary polynomials are used in the z  direction to resemble 
the kinematic assumption of displacements that is made in the various shear deformation 
plate theories. Function )(zf i  is selected to satisfy the geometric boundary conditions for 
U i  on the top and bottom faces. Herein, completely stress-free top and bottom surfaces are 
considered, such that 1)( =zf i . 
The functions in Eq. (4.6) are continuous everywhere and do not result in any stress 
singularities. Clearly, these functions do not improve the Ritz method by capturing a crack in 
the plate. In Eqs. (4.3), the integration domain for an intact plate does not differ from that for 
a cracked plate. Consequently, if only the admissible functions in Eq. (4.6) are employed, 
then the effect of the crack on the behaviors of the plate cannot be reflected and the resulting 
solutions apply to an intact plate.  
To make the Ritz method capable of taking into account the influence of a crack on the

(i=1 and 2) yields no stress singularities. Consequently, the admissible functions in Eq. (4.7) 
result in the correct stress singularity order at 1 0r = and 2 0r = .  
 
For simplicity, set cii NNN == 2_1_ , ix xN N= , iy yN N= , and iz zN N=  for i=1, 2,

homogenous equations for those coefficients. An eigenvalue problem is thus obtained, in 
which the eigenvalues are the natural frequencies of the plate.   
4.3 Convergence and comparison 
The Ritz approach herein yields natural frequencies that converge to exact values from 
the upper bounds as the number of appropriate admissible functions increases sufficiently.  
Convergence studies were conducted for square plates with different h /b , m , and boundary 
combinations to verify the correctness of the proposed solutions. Two types of boundary 
conditions on side faces 1, 2, 3, 4 (see Fig. 4.1) are considered- SSSS and CFFF, where S, F 
and C denote simply supported, free and clamped, respectively. The geometric boundary 
conditions of SSSS plates are 032 == UU  at x=0 and x=a , and 031 == UU  at y=0 and 
y=b . Thus, in Eq. (7), )()(1 ybyz,y,xg −= , )(),,(2 xaxzyxg −= , and 
)-()()(3 ybyxaxz,y,xg −= . For the CFFF plates, xzyxg i =),,( for i=1, 2 and 3 in Eq. 
(4.7). In the following, Poisson’s ratio is set to 0.3 for homogeneous plates.  
Since the literature includes no results concerning vibrations of a plate with an internal 
crack based on three-dimensional elasticity theory, the published results based on plate 
theories are used to validate the present solutions. Consequently, Table 4.2 summarizes the 
convergence studies of the first five non-dimensional frequency parameters Ehb /)/( 2 ρω  
for a simply supported homogeneous square thin plate (h /b =0.05) having a horizontal central 
 34 
thickness-to-length ratio changes from 0.01 to 0.05, the results obtained using classical plate 
theory become significantly larger than those obtained using the other theories, and the 
differences may exceed 6%. The differences become even greater as the thickness-to-length 
ratio increases. The frequencies obtained using the Mindlin plate theory are lower than the 
three-dimensional results, and their variation is less than 2% even when the 
thickness-to-length ratio is 0.2.   
Table 4.4 presents the convergence of the non-dimensional frequencies for a moderately 
thick (h /b =0.1) and cantilevered (CFFF) FGM square plate with a vertical central crack and a 
crack length of d /a = 0.6. The plate is made of aluminum (Al) and alumina (Al2O3), and the 
material properties vary according to Eq. (4.1) with m =5 in the thickness direction. The 
non-dimensional frequency parameter cc Ehb /)/(
2 ρω , in which subscript “c” refers to 
ceramic (Al2O3), is adopted. The numerical results were obtained using orthogonal 
polynomials yx NN × = 3×3, 4×4, …, 9×9, ordinary polynomials zN =3, 4, 5 and crack 
functions cN =0, 2, 3, 4, 5. The convergent results that were obtained using no crack 
functions agree well with those obtained by Zhao e t a l. (2009) using Mindlin plate theory. 
Zhao e t a l. (2009) employed the element-free kp-Ritz method to obtain the first four 
non-dimensional frequencies of an intact FGM plate, which are 0.6768, 1.568, 3.927 and 
4.263. Incorporating crack functions into the admissible functions substantially enhances the 
convergence of solutions. Using the admissible functions with yx NN × =9×9, zN =5 and 
cN =5 (a total of 2415 terms) gives the solutions that are accurate to at least three significant 
figures, while using the admissible functions with yx NN × =3×3, zN =5 and cN =5 (a total 
of 1335 terms) yields results that are accurate to two significant figures. 
 
 
 36 
increase, and the frequencies of the other modes may increase or decrease, depending on the 
mode number and the crack length. A small crack with d /a =0.1 only reduces the first five 
frequencies of the plate less than 2% relative to those for an intact plate. A large crack with 
d /a =0.5 reduces the fifth mode frequency of a thin plate (h /b =0.02) and the fourth mode 
frequency of a thick plate (h /b =0.2) by as much as 22% and 17%, respectively.  
Tables 4.7 and 4.8 display the first five non-dimensional frequencies for CFFF square 
plates with h /b =0.1 and 0.2, respectively. The two considered angles of inclination of the 
crack are 0oα =  and 90oα = .  As do those in Tables 4.5 and 4.6, the non-dimensional 
frequencies in Tables 4.7 and 4.8 decrease as the thickness of the plate, crack length or value 
of m  increases. As the angle of inclination of the crack changes from °0  to 90° , the 
frequencies of the first mode and the third mode decrease, indicating that the stiffness 
decreases in these two modes. However, the frequencies of the fifth mode vary oppositely. 
Again, a small crack with d /a =0.1 reduces the frequencies of the plate by less than 2% from 
those for an intact plate, whereas a large crack with d /a =0.5 decreases the frequencies by up 
to 16%. Comparisons of the results for plates with horizontal central cracks in Tables 6 and 8 
reveal that the SSSS plates have higher frequencies than the CFFF plates.  
Tables 4.9 summarizes the first five non-dimensional frequencies for CFCF thick square 
plates (h /b =0.2). Two angles of inclination of the crack are considered - 90oα =  and 
150oα = . As the position of the crack changes from 0 0( , ) x ya b = (0.5, 0.5) to (0.25, 0.5), 
the frequencies of the first mode increase while most of the frequencies of the other modes 
decrease. As the angle of inclination of the crack, α , changes from °90  to °150 , the 
frequencies of the first and fifth modes increase, and most of the frequencies of the other 
modes decline. A small crack with d /a =0.1 reduces the frequencies by less than 2% from 
those of an intact plate, while a large crack with d /a =0.5 reduces the frequencies of the fifth 
mode by up to 19%. Comparisons of Tables 4.8 and 4.9 reveal that CFCF boundary 
conditions yield higher frequencies than CFFF boundary conditions.

Chapter V 
Concluding Remarks 
Free vibrations of an FGM functionally graded or homogenous plate with a internal crack 
was investigated using the Ritz method. Three theories were employed to model the 
behaviors of a plate, namely classical thin plate theory, Mindlin plate theory and 
three-dimensional elasticity theory. To obtain accurate numerical solutions, sets of crack 
functions were proposed as the admissible functions in the Ritz method based on different 
plate theories to properly account for the singularity behaviors in the neighborhood of the 
crack tip and to elucidate the discontinuities of displacements or slopes across the crack. 
What may be deficient computationally from the polynomial displacement fields used is more 
than accounted for exactly through the use of the proposed crack functions, which model the 
singular behaviors of transverse normal and shear stresses at the tip of the crack, and which 
account for the discontinuities of the displacements or their gradients across the crack. The 
use of the proposed set of functions to analyze the free vibrations of a cracked plate was 
validated by performing comprehensive convergence studies. The results of the convergence 
studies agree very favorably with previously published solutions, confirming the validity and 
accuracy of the present solutions.  
For the first time, accurate non-dimensional frequency data and nodal patterns are 
provided for rectangular cracked thin and thick plates with various combinations of boundary 
conditions. These plates have cracks with various lengths, positions and inclination angles. 
The decrease in the first five non-dimensional frequencies due to a small crack (d /a =0.1) is 
not significant.  
Although only the vibrations of cracked rectangular plates have been studied herein, the 
proposed set of crack functions can also be used directly for plates and thick elastic bodies 
with other geometries, such as circular, elliptical, polygonal, trapezoidal or skew. The 
proposed set of functions can also be used in numerical methods other than the Ritz method, 
 40 
Appendix 
 Self Evaluation 
This works, which were promised in the proposal, have been completely done. Three 
plate theories, namely classical thin plate theory, Mindlin plate theory and three-dimensional 
elasticity theory, were used in this study. Sets of crack functions for these theories were 
proposed as the admissible functions in the Ritz method to properly account for the 
singularity behaviors in the neighborhood of the crack tip and to elucidate the discontinuities 
of displacements or slopes across the crack. Adding these crack functions into polynomial 
admissible functions very significantly enhances the accuracy of the numerical results with 
very fast convergence rate. The proposed crack functions really improve the capability of the 
Ritz method in dealing with the vibrations of a cracked plate.   
Based on the results given in Chapters II and III two SCI papers (Huang et al, 2011a and 
2011b) have been polished. A manuscript based on the results shown in Chapter IV is 
preparing to submit to a SCI journal. Byproducts of the study are three SCI papers on 
vibrations of a plate with a side crack (Huang and Leissa, 2009; Huang et al., 2011c and 
2011d) published.

此會議之另一特色為每次會議均是在離大城市較遠之山區舉行。每一位參與者被要求全
程參與所有活動。半途離開者會被主辦主席嚴重警告。因此參與此會議有點像參加 Summer 
Camp。 
論文發表 時間為早上，下午則是社交活動-爬山〈hiking〉；而在晚上則再安排論文發表
討論區段。晚上之討論時段是令人最為緊張，每位當日發表論文者均須逐一坐在台上接受提
問，有些提問甚至是與論文主題關聯性不大者，有時甚至會引起辯論。有些參與者稱其為拷
問或如同坐電椅一般。由於所有參與者在會議舉行時間（6 天）互動非常頻繁，而且大部分
與會者均是多次參加此會議者，大家彼此互相熟悉，討論非常熱烈但無任何 hard feeling。在
會議結束時，大家有離別依依不捨之感情，希望下次再相見。這是在一般之大型會議裡不會
出現之情況。 
個人此次參與會議收穫良多，不管是在研究上、在學術生態之相關知識上、或是在認識
一些知名學者上。聽到大師級學者之研究報告，他們的風範、研究精神與求真態度依然令我
個人非常佩服，並鼓舞個人之研究。例如，有幾位退休教授參加此會議，報告其研究；由於
已退休，故自己獨自完成研究並發表論文於知名期刊。問及為何還如此辛苦進行研究，共同
答案為做研究是興趣。他們之成名不是沒有原因；此正是許多臺灣學者該汗顏與值得借鏡處。
另外，此次會議中有一篇有關奈米碳管振動行為之報告，利用連體力學分析奈米碳管；引起
熱烈討論，有些論點個人相當認同，可惜報告者未能提出具說服力之反駁。最後，個人參與
此次會議最大收穫是在會後休息時間與其他學者之討論。由於會議主題不像一般會議那麼廣
泛，故許多論文均與個人之研究領域相關。在會後私下討論中，可互相交換不曾出現於論文
之研究經驗與心得。 
最後，個人想再次報告回國後報差旅費所遇不合理現象。學者出國參加會議常被視為工
作之一部份，亦是以公假出國；因此，回國後因差旅費申報制度之限制，要個人貼補費用實
不合理。個人至溫哥華以北之Whistler開會，光住宿一夜即須 139加幣(尚未加稅，此還是因
在該旅館開會而有的優惠價)；結果，由於 Whistler 不在差旅費申報所列城市中，用”其它城
市” 申報，祇能申報 133 美元之每日生活費。此種不合理現象，務必修正。否則，必嚴重影
響國內學術發展。

Table 1 contrasts 2( / ) /b h Eω ρ  obtained by various theories for SSSS homogeneous cracked square 
plates with horizontal side cracks (α =  0°) having various length ratios (d /a ) and positioned at c y /b  =  0.5. As 
expected, the differences between the frequencies of very thin plates (h /b  = 0.002) obtained based on the 
classical thin plate theory and Mindlin plate theory are negligible, and both are consistent with the present 
3-D elasticity-based solutions up to at least three significant figures. For the thin (h /b  = 0.05) and moderately 
thick (h /b  = 0.1) plates, the 2( / ) /b h Eω ρ  solutions based on the classical thin plate theory are 
considerably stiffer than the solutions based on Mindlin plate theory and present 3-D elasticity theory, 
especially for moderately thick plates (h /b  = 0.1) and for the higher modes. The solutions based on Mindlin 
plate theory are slightly over-correcting in reducing the classical thin plate theory solutions for transverse 
shear effects, and the Mindlin plate theory solutions are smaller than the present 3-D elasticity-based 
solutions. Percentage differences between the shear deformable Mindlin 2( / ) /b h Eω ρ  solutions and the 
present 3-D
 
solutions are less than 1%. Generally speaking, this 1% difference does not significantly increase 
with increasing crack length ratio (d /a ).

This works, which were promised in the proposal, have been completely done. Three 
plate theories, namely classical thin plate theory, Mindlin plate theory and 
three-dimensional elasticity theory, were used in this study. Sets of crack 
functions for these theories were proposed as the admissible functions in the Ritz 
method to properly account for the singularity behaviors in the neighborhood of 
the crack tip and to elucidate the discontinuities of displacements or slopes 
across the crack. Adding these crack functions into polynomial admissible 
functions very significantly enhances the accuracy of the numerical results with 
very fast convergence rate. The proposed crack functions really improve the 
capability of the Ritz method in dealing with the vibrations of a cracked plate. 
For the first time, accurate non-dimensional frequency data and nodal patterns 
are provided for rectangular cracked thin and thick plates with various 
combinations of boundary conditions. These plates have cracks with various 
lengths, positions and inclination angles. These data can be used as standard to
