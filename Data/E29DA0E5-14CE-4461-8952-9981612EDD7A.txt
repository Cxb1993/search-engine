Abstract 
  This paper provides a novel methodology for dealing with decision-making problems in 
product design fields. The purpose of this study is to evaluate product form design in terms of the 
perspectives of Gestalt psychology and Minimalist principles. Unlike traditional AHP methods, 
the proposed decision-making model uses distinct mathematical tools to establish priorities for 
the criteria and synthesize the evaluation results. A case study was conducted to illustrate the 
practicability of this proposed model. It has shown a credible result. In addition to product form 
design, this model can be applied to related design fields, such as plane design and other visual 
design.

and visually communicates its functional structure significance to the users through metaphor, 
analogy, simile, allegory, and interface design. In product design, geometric forms are one of the 
important styles, providing not only mathematical logicality and physical stability but also visual 
compatibility and cognitive acceptability. Minimalism is a neo-modern style, focusing on simple 
geometric appearance, quality material utilization, and pure integral performance. It faithfully 
reflects and communicates a “Zeitgeist” image without any reminiscence and illusion, 
interpreting modern fashion aesthetics as well as our lifestyle. 
  Design is the conscious and intuitive effort to impose meaningful order. Product form design is 
based on the creative processes of visual aesthetics. However, the visual modularity of the human 
brain is extremely complex and mysterious, containing not only the vision but also the 
comprehension. Livingstone (1988) indicated that the brain has at least three systems for 
interpreting signals coming from our eyes: one is concerned with colors, another distinguishes 
objects from each other by looking for variations in light intensity suggestive of shadows or 
contours, and a third is concerned with movement. There is a certain connection between 
aesthetic perception and the human brain (Zeki, 2000). Kant (1979) suggested that aesthetic 
perception can be considered as an experiential inquiry of psychological essence. Gestalt 
psychology, originating as a reaction to reductionistic schools of psychology, is a theory of mind 
and brain which proposes that the operational principle of the human brain is holistic, parallel, 
and analog with self-organizing tendencies. It refers to theories of visual perception developed by 
a group of German psychologists (e.g. Koffka, 1922; Kőhler, 1959). These theories attempt to 
describe how people tend to organize visual elements into groups or unified wholes when certain 
principles such as proximity, similarity, continuity, symmetry, and closure are applied. The 
founders of Gestalt psychology believe that a perception cannot be meaningfully decomposed 
into its elementary components. They propose that the basic units of perception are themselves 
the perceptions—the “Gestalts” (or Gestalten) are the fundamental units (Goldstein, 2006). 
Gestalt principles describe the tendency to organize perceptual information into coherent patterns 
based on graphic properties (Murray et al., 1998). They emphasize the holistic nature where 
recognition is inferred more by the properties of an image as a whole rather than parts during 
visual perception. This is considered different from traditional pattern recognition where 
recognition is achieved by comparing image features of parts and their combinations (Jiang et al., 
2006). Indeed, a gestalt is more than a pattern. It is regarded as the invariants of a collection of 
patterns that can mutually be transformed into each other through a class of transformations 
encoded by, or conversely, determining that gestalt. Geometric figures or shapes yield simple 
examples for the collection of patterns representing the gestalt since each pattern is transformed 
as a whole (Breidbach and Jost, 2006). 
  Minimalism in modern design is in vogue today, while Gestalt psychology is not just 
something of the past but, in fact, is a subject of renewed interest. Minimalist design uses simple 
geometric shapes as outlines to obviate the possible ideologies of specific images as well as 
reducing unnecessary formal processing to underline the material natures. Gestalt principle

on the Gestalt laws of form perception and the Minimalist design principles, we define the 
evaluation rules as follows: 
  Criterion 1: The law of proximity posits that when we perceive a collection of objects, we will 
see objects close to each other as forming a group. For a product form design, 
using only a single shape or a small number of like shapes for components tends to 
be perceived as a Gestalt-Minimalist perception. 
  Criterion 2: The law of similarity captures the idea that elements will be grouped perceptually 
if they are similar to each other. In general, different perceptual fields are not 
advisable in a multiple-design style. For a product form design, using natural 
textures and colors can visually create similar clusters so that it tends to be 
perceived as forming a Gestalt-Minimalist perception. 
  Criterion 3: The law of continuity refers to our tendency to see patterns and therefore perceive 
things as belonging together if they form some type of continuous pattern. For a 
product form design, the surface that uses tasteful non-fussy bright color 
combinations tends to be grouped as continuous patterns to form a 
Gestalt-Minimalist perception. 
  Criterion 4: The law of symmetry captures the idea that priority in perceptual grouping is given 
to more natural, balanced, and symmetrical shapes over asymmetrical ones. Most 
geometric forms are symmetrical, and we intuitively integrate them into one 
coherent object (or percept). For a product form design, using the basic geometric 
shapes as outlines tends to be perceived as forming a Gestalt-Minimalist 
perception. 
  Criterion 5: The law of closure posits that we perceptually close up, or complete, objects that 
are not, in fact, complete. Clean and fine finishes tend to be perceived as complete 
due to visual closure ability. Within a product form design, if the surface possesses 
clean and fine finishes, it appears to be grouped together to form a 
Gestalt-Minimalist perception. 
  Step 3. Determine the weights for the criteria 
  Given a set of representative products as samples, decision makers evaluate these sample 
products according to the evaluation rules of the Gestalt-Minimalist perception. The evaluation 
grades are 5-point linguistic scales ranging from “very good” (score=0.9) to “very poor” 
(score=0.1). The higher the score the closer the criterion is to the Gestalt-Minimalist perception. 
Substituting these scoring data into SPSS software to perform the Pearson distance correlation 
analysis, we can derive a proximity matrix. Taking advantage of the eigenvalue algorithms, a set 
of weights corresponding to the criteria can be determined as below: 
                  ( )1 2 3 4 5W= w , w , w , w , w ; 5 i
i=1
w =1∑                          (2) 
  Step 4. Evaluate the priorities for the alternatives with respect to each criterion 
  Select a set of products as decision alternatives, and then construct preference relations by

Sample 2 0.62 0.66 0.62 0.34 0.54 
Sample 3 0.58 0.62 0.54 0.62 0.58 
Sample 4 0.54 0.54 0.62 0.58 0.58 
Sample 5 0.74 0.78 0.62 0.82 0.62 
Sample 6 0.82 0.82 0.82 0.82 0.82 
    Taking advantage of the eigenvalue algorithms, we found a set of eigenvalues: 4.239, 0.312, 
0.408, 0, and 0.041. The eigenvectors corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue max=4.239λ  
were 0.474, 0.451, 0.439, 0.406, and 0.463. Further normalizing these eigenvectors, the weights 
of the criteria were determined as follows: 
                ( ) [ ]Ti 5 1W= w = 0.21 0.20 0.20 0.18 0.21 ×                  (6) 
The result shows that Criterion 4 has the lowest importance and is given less weight in the 
evaluation. It is rational since the application of geometric and symmetric properties is essential 
and apparent in terms of the minimalist form design of such products. 
3.2. Evaluating product form design by the Gestalt-Minimalist perception 
  In this part of the experiment, twelve products were selected as test cases on which to try out 
the proposed model for evaluating their form design in terms of the Gestalt-Minimalist perception. 
As shown in Appendix B, all the selected iPod speakers were popular and saleable at retail stores 
and on-line shopping websites in Taiwan. Thirty university students majoring in product design 
were selected as respondents to assess these product alternatives. As with the evaluating course of 
Part 1 of the experiment, the ratings of the criteria with each corresponding product were 
linguistically evaluated by the respondents. The means and standard deviations of the quantitative 
judgments were categorized and listed as shown in Table 2. 
The mean scores for the product alternatives corresponding to the criteria were summarized in 
a matrix below:

acquiescence bias, or social desirability bias. In spite of the limitation, the 5-point linguistic 
scoring is still valuable as compared with the 9-value pairwise comparing. 
  (2) Saaty advocated the use of the eigenvector technique for deriving the weights from a given 
pairwise comparison matrix. However, the lack of automatic mechanism for improving the 
consistency ratio (CR) can make the AHP impractical or impossible for the decision making 
when the time is crucial (Cao et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008). The pairwise comparison matrix is a 
positive reciprocal matrix (Shiraishi et al., 1998). It must use redundant judgments for checking 
consistency, and this can exponentially increase the number of judgments to be elicited from 
decision makers. Some researchers even pointed out that this method can suffer from rank 
reversal (Belton and Gear, 1985; Dyer, 1990; Wang and Elhag, 2006). The proposed method uses 
a proximity matrix derived from the similarity measures of rating relations. It is a symmetric 
square matrix and we can use the eigenvalue algorithms to derive the weights of criteria. These 
weights corresponding to the criteria are sound as they are based on the principal diagonal 
elements within the proximity matrix. They can reasonably reflect the respective criterion’s 
unique positive contribution to the whole preference relations. Ribeiro and Marques Pereira 
(2003) indicated that a limitation in determining weights is that weights should sometimes 
depend on the corresponding attribute satisfaction values. They argued that the determined 
weight should be modified when considering one attribute with a high relative importance iw , 
which has a low satisfaction value ia . However, this is not the case we explored, since the 
underlying assumption here is that the contribution of an individual attribute to the total rating of 
any alternative is independent of other attribute values. 
  (3) The use of weighting functions depending continuously on attribute satisfaction values 
produces aggregation operators with complex numerical behavior. The monotonicity of the 
aggregation operator is a crucial issue which involves constraints on the derivative of the 
weighted aggregation operator with respect to the various attribute satisfaction values. In 
decision-making processes, the technique of weighted means is commonly used to aggregate 
preference information as well as to rank the order of the decision alternatives. It assumes that 
weights are proportional to the relative value of a unit change in each attribute (Hobbs, 1980). 
However, different weighted versions (e.g. weighted arithmetic mean, weighted geometric mean, 
and weighted harmonic mean) may produce different results. To overcome this problem, the 
proposed method uses the weighted generalized means to synthesize evaluation results. The 
major difference between the weighted generalized means and the conventional weighted means 
is the involvement of α  parameter. By varying the α  parameter within the interval of 
( )∞∞− , , we can derive a homologous aggregation value based on a multiple criteria analysis. 
Taking advantage of the numerical integration technique, we can harmoniously rank the decision 
alternatives as well as accurately identify the most desirable alternatives. 
In conclusion, this study contributes to our knowledge by using Gestalt theory associated with 
the minimalist principles in design areas. It also provides a novel methodology for dealing with 
decision-making problems in product design fields. The Gestalt-Minimalist perception refers to

Self-evaluation of the work 
Product form design is a creative process that involves complex visual perceptions. It is very 
important to develop a novel decision support system for designers to deal with problems 
concerning the consumers’ psychological preferences toward product forms. As Gestalt 
psychology and Minimalist principles provide an important perspective on visual perception, it is 
appropriate to apply these principles in assessing the quality of product form design. 
Gestalt and Minimalism are two important perspectives that can be used to assess product form 
design. In previous literature, however, few studies were conducted regarding the practical 
performance of using Gestalt theory associated with the minimalist design principles for 
assessing product design qualities. This study has contributed to our knowledge by using Gestalt 
theory associated with the minimalist principles in product design areas, providing a novel 
methodology for dealing with decision-making problems. 
This study has completed a research paper entitled “A Gestalt-Minimalism-based 
decision-making model for evaluating product form design”. It has been submitted to

Abstract 
    Web-based learning has recently become a promising alternative to the traditional 
classroom. It can be regarded as a way to bridge the digital gap among individuals. 
Understanding why users accept or reject information technology is an important issue. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of asynchronous web-based learning on 
unemployed adult novices in Taiwan. The experimental results indicated that the majority of 
unemployed adult novices believe that web-based learning is useful for enhancing their job 
performance. However, the use of web-based learning technology seems not to be effective to 
them. 
    With regard to individual differences in gender, age, education, and learning performance, 
education is the critical factor influencing unemployed adult novices’ web-based learning. It 
was significantly and positively related to web-based learning performance, and also had a 
group impact on perceived ease of use in terms of the low-education and high-education 
subjects. The present study suggests that a novice’s educational level should be taken into 
account when developing an asynchronous web-based learning system. Certain web-based 
learning characteristics of the specific user population were also discussed.

2. Research model and experimental hypotheses 
  Web-based learning has recently become a promising alternative to the traditional 
classroom, supporting our society to achieve the goals of lifelong learning and on-demand 
learning. According to the technology acceptance model (TAM), the antecedents to actual use 
of technology are to be sought in the attitudes toward technology which in turn is determined 
by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and a set of external variables such as 
socio-structural, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics. 
 
Based on the concept of the TAM, the author used a technology acceptance inquiry to 
assess the impact of web-based learning on unemployed adult novices. The purpose of the 
technology acceptance inquiry was to understand the perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived 
ease of use (PEU) involved with the asynchronous web-based learning technology. The 
experimental hypotheses are as follows: 
 
H1a: Gender difference in web-based learning performance was not significant. 
H1b: Age range difference in web-based learning performance was not significant. 
H1c: Education difference in web-based learning performance was not significant. 
H2a: The correlation of perceived usefulness between gender groups was not significant. 
H2b: The correlation of perceived usefulness between age groups was not significant. 
H2c: The correlation of perceived usefulness between education groups was not significant. 
H2d: The correlation of perceived usefulness between learning performance groups was not 
significant. 
H3a: The correlation of perceived ease of use between gender groups was not significant. 
H3b: The correlation of perceived ease of use between age groups was not significant. 
H3c: The correlation of perceived ease of use between education groups was not 
significant. 
H3d: The correlation of perceived ease of use between learning performance groups was 
not significant. 
 
 
3. Methodology 
3.1. Subjects 
A total of 183 subjects were selected from the trainees of a web-based computer-training 
program in which they participated in the experimental study voluntarily. The participants 
were qualified unemployed adults who involuntarily left their jobs. The demographic data of 
this experiment were classified as shown in Table 1. 
 
3.2. Experimental design and materials 
3.2.1. The elementary computer-training program and web-based learning system 
  In order to conduct this experimental research, an asynchronous learning course was 
provided for the subjects who learned elementary computer skills. There were three major 
12 2009 The International Conference on  Industrial Globalization and Technology
testing time was restricted to 10 minutes for each unit test. All the three unit test results were 
concurrently scored and recorded by the system. 
 
3.2.3. Technology acceptance inquiry of the web-based learning 
  User analysis requires researchers to identify the characteristics of user population that are 
likely to influence their acceptance and effective use of the system. The users’ perceptions of 
web-based learning are considered by applying the technology acceptance model (TAM). 
TAM has been widely used to predict the acceptance of a new technology. It postulates that 
the two variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, have great relevance to a 
user’s technology acceptance behavior. According to the concept of the TAM, the author 
developed a technology acceptance inquiry to analyze the unemployed adult novices’ 
web-based learning characteristics. The inquiry consisted of two parts: perceived usefulness 
(PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU). Each part comprised five closed-ended questions, and 
each question contained three options with one only choice. 
 
3.3. Procedure 
  The empirical study used a post-test design. Participants learned elementary computer skills 
in their own rates of progress through the asynchronous web-based learning system. An 
assistant was available in the classroom, whose major assignment was not to teach the courses 
but to assist participants in dealing with the hardware and software problems. Three on-line 
tests were given in order after they had finished the corresponding three course units. All test 
results were scored and recorded by the system, which were used for analyzing the subjects’ 
web-based learning achievements in this study. Having completed the overall learning courses 
and the corresponding tests, a paper-version questionnaire was provided to the subjects. Each 
subject responded the questions according to his/her own learning experience and knowledge. 
 
 
4. Results 
4.1. Web-based learning achievements 
  The mean score of the overall responses was 71.05 (S.D.=7.05). According to the score 
ranges, we divided the subjects into three groups: high performance (scored more than 80), 
medium performance (scored between 70 and 79), and low performance (scored less than 69). 
The mean scores of the on-line tests were 83.02 (N=27, S.D.=3.55) for the high-performance 
group, 73.96 (N=69, S.D.=2.82) for the medium-performance group, and 65.02 (N=87, 
S.D.=2.55) for the low-performance group. Out of the 183 subjects, nearly half did not 
perform well in the on-line tests. 
 
  With respect to individual differences in learning achievements, the mean scores of the 
on-line tests were 70.18 (S.D.=6.97) for the male subjects and 71.33 (S.D.=7.08) for the 
female subjects. Females were better than males in terms of the mean score results. The mean 
scores of the on-line tests were 72.14 (S.D.=6.63) for the young adult subjects aged under 44,

web-based learning system for the first time, 37.5% of the elderly respondents felt amazing, 
yet 52.9% of the young adult respondents and 55.4% of the middle-aged respondents 
immediately had a shot at using the system without any hesitation. When an error message 
appears on the system, 41.2% of the young adult respondents would like to read the content of 
the message as well as to try to solve the problem by themselves; 56.8% of the middle-aged 
respondents would like to request experienced help; 33.3% of the elderly respondents would 
like to reboot the system. 
 
5.3 Education difference 
  Education difference in web-based learning performance was significant, with the higher 
the educational level the higher the web-based learning achievement. It is worthy to remark 
that education difference in word processing and Internet application was significant in terms 
of the subjects’ web-based learning achievements. Education effect on perceived usefulness 
was insignificant; however, there was a group impact on perceived ease of use in terms of the 
low-education and high-education subjects. 54.8% of the low-education respondents and 
57.1% of the middle-education respondents considered the web-based learning a tendency 
toward present day society, while 51.1% of the high-education respondents thought it an ideal 
solution to the digital divide problems. 59% of the middle-education respondents considered 
web-based learning to be disadvantageous due to the lack of timely help by a teacher; 41.9% 
of the low-education respondents indicated that the web-based learning system is too 
complicated for them to understand; 44.7% of the high-education respondents thought the 
uniform learning mode cannon meet their individual requirements. When appearing an error 
message, 67.7% of the low-education respondents would like to request experienced help, yet 
44.7% of the high-education respondents would like to read the content of the message 
carefully as well as to try to solve the problem by themselves. 
 
5.4 Learning performance difference 
  Learning performance effect on both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use was 
insignificant. 59.8% of the low-performance and 59.3% of the high-performance respondents 
expressed that they got a measure of achievement and developed a high interest in learning 
computer skills; 55.1% of the medium-performance respondents considered that they got a 
limited achievement but did not refuse learning more computer skills after they had completed 
the asynchronous web-based learning program. 72.4% of the low-performance and 70.4% of 
the high-performance respondents considered web-based learning as a good way for learning, 
yet 29% of the medium-performance respondents worried that the web-based learning process 
and outcome were difficult to be controlled. 37% of the high-performance and 35.6% of the 
low-performance respondents expressed that web-based learning cannot meet their individual 
requirements due to its uniform learning mode, while 62.3% of the medium-performance 
respondents feared that they could not solve the problems timely with the help of a teacher 
when using the asynchronous web-based learning system.

產品造形設計是一項創意過程，牽涉複雜的視覺感知。對設計師而言，發展一套決策支援
系統，以協助處理有關顧客對產品造形之心理喜好評測是一項重要的議題。由於完形心理
學與極簡設計原理提供一項重要的視覺感知觀點，非常適合運用此原理以評估產品造形設
計品質。 
    雖然完形視覺感知與極簡主義是產品設計的兩項重要觀點，可用於協助評估產品造形
設計，但文獻上有關完形理論與極簡設計之整合應用研究，卻極度缺乏。本研究主要貢獻
在於將完形視覺感知理論結合極簡設計原理，提出一套＂完形－極簡決策評估模式＂，本
決策評估模式可用於協助設計師進行產品造形設計評估，處理複雜的造形視覺感知等決策
評估問題。
