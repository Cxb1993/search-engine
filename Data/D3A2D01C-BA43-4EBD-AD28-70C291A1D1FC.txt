Abstract 
While considering the demand in service science, radio frequency identification (RFID) stands 
out as a technology that is capable of simultaneously capturing the identities of multiple objects in 
real-time. Because of its unique and wireless features are very suitable for the application of 
technology services, it has been heralded as one of the technologies that will fundamentally 
transform the industries. However, currently the demand of the customers is the main driver for the 
introduction. The bottom line should still be whether or not the investment can be justified by the 
benefit resulting from the introduction of the technology. 
This research will analyze the model of vehicle arrival time, the model of passenger demand, 
and the utility function of passenger waiting time to simulate the benefit of technology introduction. 
The primary application focus is the influence to passengers and operators of public transportation 
systems. On the other hand, the research by employing RFID along with other communication 
technologies, public transportation vehicles can be identified and tracked during their services, with 
the ability to “calibrate” where exactly such vehicles are along their routes, the arrival time for the 
vehicles to the stops can be estimated more accurately. That is why for passengers can then keep 
shorter lead time to meet the vehicle schedule; service providers may provide the same level of 
passenger service with less frequent vehicle services, for another thing it can be used by the 
companies for evaluating if the adjustment of service as well as the justification of technology

application model for public transportation and the benefits expected from the system are 
established. The cost model is developed in Section 4. Numerical examples and their results are 
analyzed in Section 5. Finally, the research is concluded and directions for future research are 
provided. 
2. RFID Justification Frameworks 
The adoption framework proposed consists of 4 main stages to ensure the organization whether 
they need RFID in their system. It consists of the preliminary analysis, business process analysis, 
technical analysis and cost/benefit analysis. The preliminary analysis will provide some insight to 
the company to analyze their need. Furthermore, business process analysis will prove whether RFID 
will make their process better, and in technical analysis the company will find out the best scenario 
on the type of technology and in what level should they adopt the RFID technology. Complete 
details on the framework will be discussed in the following session. 
 
Figure 1 RFID Adoption Framework 
2.1. Preliminary Analysis 
Before implementing the RFID technology to their system, the company has to analyze its 
need and make sure whether they really need this technology. The following step is setup the target 
and expected benefits of implementing RFID. 
Furthermore, the main question to be answered is: Under what factor/criteria/environment 
RFID will provide significant help?  
2.2. Business Process Analysis 
This stage will analyze the current business process and define whether they really need RFID 
application, and then modeling the changes in the business process while using the RFID. In order 
to develop strategies and structures for RFID, companies need to understand their business process, 
and the obstacles that exist with RFID, these following questions will help the company to assess 
their business process: 
• How the current processes flow? 
• What improvement can be achieved by using the new technology? 
• Will the new technology bring significant alteration in the system? 
• What modifications to their internal process are necessary to take advantage of the technology? 
Methods can be utilized for this analysis: interviews or questionnaire survey, value stream

passengers. Advanced planning functions can also be implemented on the passengers’ devices to 
facilitate intelligent transportation. 
 
Figure 2 RFID application framework in public transportation system 
The proposed information system would provide benefits for both the passengers and the bus 
operators. For passengers, the system will enable better prediction on bus arrival schedule, and 
subsequently reducing the waiting time and travel time. In addition, although the perceived waiting 
time is greater than the actual waiting time, the real-time location information of the buses can 
instigate the perceived to be equal to the actual one, which in turn increases the level of satisfaction 
from passengers. 
For the bus operators, the objective is to manage the dispatch of buses effectively to meet the 
passenger service requirement reflected by the length of the headway. With the real-time bus 
location information, bus operators will be able to improve their operation by varying bus schedules 
to meet unexpected situations. More importantly, as passengers can learn more accurately the 
arrival time of the buses, the frequency of the buses will not need to be as high to meet the same 
level of passenger satisfaction. Therefore, the information acquisition and distribution system will 
either enhance the passenger service level and/or reduce the operation cost for the bus operator. 
4. Minimum-Cost Headway Model 
The aim of this model is to find the optimal headways respectively for the two systems. The 
principal trade-off is between the passengers waiting time and operating costs. As the bus headway 
becomes shorter, passengers waiting time decreases and the service level to passenger increases. 
However, simultaneously the operating cost for bus operators increases too, because by which it 
means dispatching a larger number of buses for the same period of time. In contrast, if the headway 
becomes longer, the number of buss dispatched will be smaller. The passenger waiting time will 
then be longer and the service level lower. Such relationship can be illustrated in Figure 3 below.

waiting time. 
 
Figure 4 Different passengers behavior for system with vs. without RFID 
Figure 4 describes the difference will experienced by passengers when the RFID is used in the 
bus route. When the passengers provided with the information on bus location, they can time their 
arrival, so the arrival will be less random (although it will be still random), and in the bus station 
they also will get the information about the recent location of the bus, which will remove the 
uncertainty while waiting. In this case, the passengers expected waiting time will be shorter. 
Based on previous researches on waiting time, the derivation of Ew[t] is as follows. For the 
passengers arriving randomly at a stop, the probability density function (p.d.f.) of the waiting time 
 can be estimated by the p.d.f. of the headway on a specific bus route ; and the 
relationship is given as below (Larson et al., 1981): 
 = λ H(t)                         (4) 
where  is cumulative distribution function of the headway, H(t) =1- , E [h]is the mean 
headway, and is the bus frequency where λ= . 
Furthermore, the expected value or the mean of the waiting time can be calculated as: 
Ew[t] =                             (5) 
Marguier et al. (1984) give the direct result of the mean waiting time as: 
Ew[t] = [1+ ]                             (6) 
where varH is the variance of the buses headway. 
Instead of the difference on expected waiting time, there also will be difference in the 
passengers’ perceived waiting time. Understanding the relationship between perceived waiting time 
8 
min E[ ]= q(t) +p T 
= q(t) p               (14) 
Where 0 < h                                              
Solving the objective function, we can get the system total cost and optimal headway for the 
system with RFID and the one without. The difference between the two costs can then be derived as 
the benefit of using RFID in the system. 
Furthermore, the verification process should be followed by Cost-Benefit Analysis which is 
the process of measuring the trade-off between the total cost required for RFID investment and the 
benefits derived from the project. This is a fundamental and indispensable step, because it is the 
main analysis behind a “go” or “no-go” decision. This analysis can be formulated as a return on 
investment value, as follow: 
ROI =                 (15) 
By comparing the minimum-cost headway for the system using RFID technology with the one 
without, the amount in cost reduction can be obtained and will be considered as the benefit of RFID 
application. The RFID implementation cost consist of RFID tag for each bus, RFID reader installed 
in every bus station, bus stops, traffic lights and lamp posts, the display infrastructure at every bus 
stops, and the RFID middleware infrastructure – software, servers, and database. 
Table 1 Cost and Benefit Analysis for RFID application in public transportation 
 
Additionally, the payback period also can be used as the analysis tools, and when the analysis 
resulted in the feasible payback period and return on investment, the operator can be confidently 
implement RFID in their system. 
5. Numerical Example 
A simple case is applied to the minimum-cost headway model to more clearly illustrate the 
benefit of the proposed RFID system. The passengers’ arrival is assumed to follow Poisson process, 
bus operating cost p is 600 NT/hour. The wage rate is 215.8 NT/ hour. It is estimated from the

investigate the system cost model robustness and understand the positive or negative influence of 
particular model parameters to the system total cost and the optimal headway. It also needed to 
validate our minimum-cost headway function, and we used different value for particular parameters; 
operating cost, waiting cost, passenger ridership, and the results are as follows: 
Table 3 Sensitivity analysis 
 
It is shown that although we change the parameter to the lower or higher value, the system 
with RFID always have lower system cost and longer headway. It means the system with RFID 
always performs better. 
6. Conclusions 
In this research we have proposed an application of RFID in the public transportation. A 
three-layer system architecture is proposed, consists of data capturing front-end which have the tag 
attached in every buses and reader located on every terminals bus stops, traffic lights and lamp 
posts; middleware systems where the data read by the reader is processed; and the application layer 
where the passengers can utilize the information on real-time bus location. 
Potential benefits of the systems are investigated, and it is obvious that knowing the real time 
bus location will decrease the passengers waiting time, especially the perceived waiting time. The 
bus operator can utilize the number of buses efficiently, running fewer numbers of buses for the 
same service level, hence reducing the operating cost. The minimum-cost headway model is 
generated to verify the benefit. The objective function is to minimize the total system cost, which 
consists of bus operating cost and passengers waiting cost. The decision variable is to find the 
optimal service frequency, or known as the headway. Numerical examples are presented to examine 
the benefit of the proposed framework, and the results imply that the proposed system will benefit 
and decrease the system total cost. The sensitivity analysis also presented and the result shown that 
the system with RFID performs better than the one without. 
Finally, our model clearly does not capture many of the complexities involved in the real world. 
Hence, it is potential to relax some assumptions and make the model close by the real world, such 
us using the fleet size constraint, considering non-random passenger arrival, and conducting survey 
to get the waiting time function. It is also potential for future research in the transit route choice 
analysis which investigates the benefit of the real time information to minimize the total travel time 
of passengers.
