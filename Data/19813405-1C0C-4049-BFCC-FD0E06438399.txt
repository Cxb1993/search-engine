Abstract 
This research is to develop two modified periodic preventive maintenance (PM) models and 
the optimal PM policies in a finite time span for fitting the real world PM problems. The first 
modified PM model is developed for the cases of age reduction and failure rate reduction by 
  
*Abstract - For an age reduction preventive maintenance 
(PM) model over a finite time span (L), it is found from 
literature that a shorter interval between each PM (T) can 
result in a better expected total maintenance cost (TC). The 
optimal policy of the stated PM model (called the original 
PM model) is usually obtained by searching the optimal 
value of T over the specified range [Tmin, Tmax) for a given 
number of PM (N) by minimizing the total maintenance cost 
where Tmin and Tmax are defined as L/(N+1) and L/N,
respectively. However, the original PM model does limit the 
possibility of finding a smaller TC since the value of T is 
constrained in the range of [Tmin, Tmax). In this paper, we 
consider the idea of releasing the constraint of the searching 
range of T and propose a new PM model with age reduction 
in a finite time period which can have a better optimal 
solution than the corresponding original PM model. The 
algorithm of finding the optimal solution for the new model 
is developed. Examples of the proposed new model are 
provided and are compared with the corresponding original 
PM model.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 For a repairable system, it is known that the 
preventive maintenance (PM) can decelerate the aging 
speed or reduce the failure rate and then restore the 
system to a younger state (Pham and Wang [1], 
Nakagawa [2]). In real world, a system’s useful life is 
normally finite. Then, when an aged system is replaced by 
a new one, the new system seldom has exactly the same 
conditions (such as characteristics, investment cost, and 
maintenance expenses) as the system of the previous 
replacement cycle has. However, most existing PM 
models and policies are defined over the infinite time span, 
which can be found from literature such as Nakagawa [2], 
Jayabalan and Chaudhuri [3], and Cheng and Chen [4]. 
These PM models assume that the system in each 
replacement cycle has the same conditions and costs. The 
theoretical optimal policy of each PM model is then 
developed based on the long-term expectation of failure 
occurrences which can be obtained by minimizing the 
expected average cost over a single replacement cycle. 
Therefore, it seems that the PM model under the 
assumption of infinite time span might not be practical.

 There is not much literature discussing the PM 
models for the case of finite time span. Most of the 
research relating to the finite-time-span PM problems are 
for the leasing equipments of which the PM models with 
failure rate reduction, age reduction, and degradation rate 
reduction are studied. For the leasing equipments, 
Pongpech and Murthy [5] developed an optimal PM 
policy with failure rate reduction; Yeh and Chen [6] 
provided an optimal periodic PM policy with age 
reduction. Cheng et al. [7] developed the optimal 
degradation-rate-reduction PM policies with warranty in a 
finite time span. Cheng and Liu [8] found that the 
algorithm for finding the optimal PM policy proposed by 
Pongpech and Murthy [5] can be suitable for both fully-
periodic and partially-periodic1 PM policies. 
 From the PM models with failure rate reduction over 
a finite time interval (L) provided by Pongpech and 
Murthy [5] and Cheng and Liu [8], it can be found that a 
shorter time interval of PM (T) can result in a better 
expected total maintenance cost (TC). However, the 
optimal value of T of the above PM models is constrained 
in the range of min max[ , )T T  where min /( 1)T L N   and 
max /T L N . Chen et al. [9] have proven that the optimal 
value of T for the PM model with the stated constraint be 
the smallest possible value (i.e., the low constraint value, 
minT ) when given a specified N. Thus, the constraint 
limits the possibility of finding the optimal T having value 
smaller than minT . 
 In this paper, we examine the effect of the restriction 
on T for the case of age reduction. We call the PM models 
with T being constrained in the range of min max[ , )T T  as the 
original PM model which is illustrated in Fig. 1 where  is 
the restored age of each PM,  is the time interval 
between L and the time of the last PM (NT), i.e.,  = L  
NT. It can be seen that  < T when T is restricted in the 
range min max[ , )T T . 
 Based on the fact that a shorter time interval of PM 
can result in a better expected total maintenance cost [5, 
8], the idea of this paper is to obtain a better solution by 
releasing the restriction of T value. Thus, we propose a 
new PM model with age reduction over a finite time span 
by modifying the original PM model. The concept of the 
new model is illustrated in Fig. 2. Under a specified finite  
                                                          
1 The last PM cycle in a partially-periodic PM policy has 
a shorter time interval than the other equal-length PM 
cycles.

III.  THE OPTIMAL PM POLICY 
 
 The optimal solution for the above modified PM 
model can be obtained by minimizing the expected total 
maintenance cost TC. It requires an algorithm with 
numerical method to search for the optimal solution. In 
this paper, we modify the algorithm provided by Cheng 
and Liu [8] which applies the Nelder-Mead searching 
method to obtain the optimal solution. The modified 
algorithm is presented as follows. 
 
1. Let N = 0, TN = L, N = 0. 
2. Calculate Cmin = TC(N, TN, N) using (7) or (8). 
(Note: Cmin equals to the expected total maintenance 
cost of no PM being performed.) 
3. Let N = 1. 
4. Calculate TU  = L/N. 
5. Use Nelder-Mead method to Search the values of TN 
in the range of (0, TU] and N in the range of [0, 1] 
such that TC(N, TN, N) shown in (7) or (8) is 
minimized; 
let C0 = minimal value of TC(N, TN, N). 
6. If C0 % Cmin then obtain the optimal solution: 
N* = N-1, T* = TN*, * = N*, and TC(N*,T*,*); 
stop, 
else 
let N = N+1 and Cmin = C0; go to Step 4. 
 
 
IV.  NUMERICAL EXAMPLES 
 
 Some numerical examples are performed and the 
optimal solutions of the modified PM model are 
compared with those of the original PM model proposed 
by Yeh and Chen [6] which is fully-periodic model. The 
conditions of these numerical examples are described as 
follows: L=5; Cmr=1; and Cpm is defined by Eq.(3) where 
the coefficients a, b, and c of Cpm are assigned with 
different values as shown in Table I. The system’s life is 
assumed to follow Weibull distribution with scale 
parameter  =1 and shape parameter  = 2.5, and 3.

by a new one, the new system seldom has exactly the same conditions (such as 
characteristics, investment cost, and maintenance expenses) as those of the 
system of the previous replacement cycle. It seems that the PM model found in 
literature (e.g., Nakagawa [2], Jayabalan and Chaudhuri [3], and Cheng and 
Chen [4]), which are under the assumption of infinite time span, might not be 
suitable for the above case. 
There is only some literature relating to the PM models of finite time span. 
The PM models for the leasing equipments are the most often seen examples of 
the finite-time-span case. These models are usually defined with a periodic PM 
interval. Pongpech and Murthy [4] developed a periodic PM model with failure 
rate reduction for the leasing equipments in a finite time period. Cheng and Liu 
[5] discussed the cases of fully-periodic and partially-periodic PM policies 
using the algorithm proposed by Pongpech and Murthy [4]. The PM model 
provided by Pongpech and Murthy [4] limits the possibility of finding a better 
solution since the searching range of the PM interval (T) for any given number 
of PM (N) is constrained in the range of [Tmin, Tmax) where min /( 1)T L N   and 
max /T L N . Cheng et al. [6] developed a modified periodic PM model for the 
failure rate reduction case by releasing the constraint of the searching range of T.  
On the other aspect, a new machine will not fail easily in the early stage of 
its useful life. This phenomenon reflects the theoretical fact that the optimal 
policy of a sequential PM has longer PM intervals in the earlier stage of its 
useful lifetime (Nakagawa [2]). Thus, for a finite time span issue, in order to 
obtain a better PM policy, we consider the idea of delaying the initial time of a 
periodic PM program. The purpose of this research is to apply the above idea to 
develop a periodic PM model whose optimal PM policy has smaller expected 
total maintenance cost (TC) than the optimal PM policy of the comparative PM 
model.  
The modified PM model developed by Cheng et al. [6] is illustrated in 
Figure 1 where  is the restored failure rate of each PM,  is the time interval 
between L and the time of the last PM (NT), i.e.,  = L  NT. Note that, unlike 
the model of Pongpech and Murthy [4] having a constraint for , there is no 
constraint for  in the base PM model. Thus, under a specified finite time 
interval L and a given number of PM N, Cheng et al. [6] showed that the 
optimal solution has the result of   T. Cheng et al. [6] also presented examples 
to show the modified periodic PM model can provide a PM policy which is 
better than or same as the optimal PM policy presented by Pongpech and 
Murthy [4]. Thus, the modified PM model with failure rate reduction developed 
by Cheng et al. [6] is called the base model in this paper.  
 
 
2.   The Delayed PM Model with Failure Rate Reduction 
In this delayed PM model, the improvement factor introduced by Malik [7] is 
applied to measure the PM restoration effect. The minimal repair cost and the 
PM cost are considered in the delayed PM model.   
2.1.   Nomenclature

equipment

effect 
δ The quantity of the restored failure rate after each PM, which 
is measured by the improvement factor  
 The time of the first PM where   T 
λ(t) The original hazard rate function (before the 1st PM action) 
λi(t) The hazard rate function at time t where t is in the ith PM cycle

Cmr The minimal repair cost of each failure 
( , , )TC N T   The expected total maintenance cost function over the finite 
life time interval L 
2.2.   The Assumptions 
The following are the assumptions for the delayed PM model. 
 The system is deteriorating over time with increasing failure rate (IFR) in 
which Weibull failure distribution is assumed in this paper, i.e., 
 1( ) ( )tt   
  (1) 
 where  is the scale parameter and  is the shape parameter with  > 1. 
 The initial time of the PM program is delayed and the first PM is performed 
at time  where   T. 
 The PM can reduce the system’s failure rate to a younger level. 
 The quantity of the failure rate restored after each PM (δ) is assumed to be 
constant.  
 
 
3.1.   The Algorithm For The delayed PM Model 
(1) Let N = 0, N = 0, N = 0. 
(2) Calculate Cmin = TC(N, N, N) using Eq.(4) or (5). (Note: Cmin equals 
to the expected total maintenance cost of no PM being performed.) 
(3) Let N = 1. 
(4) Use Nelder-Mead method to Search the values of N over the range of 
(0, L] and N over the range of [0, 1] such that TC(N, N, N) is 
minimized;  
let C0 = minimal value of TC(N, N, N) and N
N
LT
N
 . 
(5) If C0  Cmin, obtain the optimal solution: 
     * -1N N , ** N  , ** N  , and TC(N*, *,*); stop, 
else 
     let N = N+1 and Cmin = C0; go to Step (4). 
4.   Numerical Examples 
Some numerical examples are performed and the optimal solutions of the 
delayed PM model are compared with those of the base PM model proposed by 
Cheng et al. [6]. The conditions of these numerical examples are described as 
follows: L=5; Cmr=1; and Cpm is defined by Eq.(2); the coefficients a, b, and c of 
Cpm are assigned with different values as shown in Table 1. The system’s life is 
assumed to follow Weibull distribution with scale parameter  =1 and shape 
parameter  = 1.5, 2.5, and 3. 
Table 1 shows the optimal solutions of the examples by using the base PM 
model and the delayed PM model. For the delayed PM model, we obtained the 
following results: 
(1) If N* >1, it can be seen that  * > T* when  = 2.5 or 3 while  * < T* 
when  = 1.5. 
(2) When  = 2.5 or 3, it can be noted that N * = 1 if c = 1.5 and N * > 1 
otherwise; when  = 1.5, most of the cases have N * = 1. 
(3) When  = 2.5 or 3, it can be found that the delayed PM model has 
smaller TC* than the base model if c < 1.5; when  = 1.5, the delayed 
PM model and the base model have the same optimal solution for most 
of the cases. 
We also analyze the sensitivity of each parameter to the optimal solution 
for the proposed PM model by using the ANOVA method which is shown in 
Table 2. It can be found that  and c are significantly sensitive to the optimal 
total maintenance cost TC.  
 
 
 
stage of its lifetime. In this paper, the delayed PM model with failure rate 
reduction is developed for the case of finite time span and an algorithm for 
finding the optimal PM policy is provided. It is shown from the examples that 
the delayed PM model can provide at least as good optimal solution as the base 
PM model (while it can result in a better solution in some cases). When Weibull 
failure distribution with  < 2 the PM program can not be delayed (i.e.,  is not 
greater than T). The delayed PM model is more suitable than the base model 
when Weibull failure distribution has larger values of   and when the PM cost 
(Cpm) has lower value of c.

二、與會心得 
此次研討會中，大會在每天的餐會均細心安排與會學者專家認識立陶宛的文化，例如，在 7/10
會議結束後為大會安排的晚宴，晚宴地點設在維爾紐斯具有歷史文化的老城區內一棟藝廊的庭院
內，整個晚宴是個充滿音樂的饗宴。在研討會的最後一天，主辦單位在維爾紐斯大學辦了一場歡送
會，讓與會的專家學者備感溫馨。本次行程，本人順道參觀維爾紐斯市之人文景觀與文化古蹟。參
與本次研討會過程中獲得以下心得： 
1. 於本研討會中發現，EURO 研討會是個超級大的研討會，其影響力不僅是學界與業界在作業研究
領域的交流動向，甚至對舉辦國家與城市的觀光業亦帶來很大的效益。在每個場次每個人的論文
發表時間均相當充分，可以達到較充實的學術交流，值得我們學習與效法。 
2. 本人參與此次會議收穫非常豐富，不但開拓本人的國際視野，並體認學術需與國際學術潮流接軌
和交流的重要性，在此感謝國科會的補助。 
三、發表論文全文或摘要 
Abstract 
For a preventive maintenance (PM) model over a finite time span, shorter PM interval can result in a 
better expected total maintenance cost (TC). However, the original optimal PM policies shown in literature 
are obtained by searching the optimal PM interval over a constrained range. We propose two modified 
failure-rate-reduction optimal PM policies: one is developed by releasing the constraint of the PM interval 
searching range; another is constructed by postponing the starting time of the PM program based on the fact 
that equipment is not easily fail in the early stage of its useful life.
