技術說明
英文：Oil and grease is composed of hydrocarbon which contains high
degree of electron. Due to this reason, O＆G is considered an organic
matter with high potential for renewable bio-energy during the
anaerobic bio-process. The technology of Reverse Flow Jet Loop
Reactor (RFJLR) in this study is aimed to increase the efficiency of
bio-energy recovered from O＆G by using RFJLR in aerobic
partial-oxidation process to hydrolyze O＆G into Long Chain Fatty
Acid (LCFA) and Volatile Acid (VA) as fast as possible. And later, this
two compounds enter the second and third anaerobic bio-process to
recover the energy.

different concentrations of broken kitchen waste were added as fermentation substrates. In
addition, each bottle contained the following chemicals as growth nutrients (in mg/L): resazurin,
0.175 mg/L; CaCl2‧6H2O, 32.32; MgCl2‧6H2O, 232.26; KCl, 167.81; MnCl2‧4H2O, 63.87;
CoCl2‧6H2O, 3.87; H3BO3, 0.74; CuCl‧2H2O, 0.35; Na2MoO4‧2H2O, 0.33; ZnCl2, 0.27;
FeCl2‧4H2O, 10.62; sodium thioglycolate, 217.35; KH2PO4, 119. The medium pH was
adjusted to 7.2 using KOH and HCl. The bottles were capped tightly with rubber septum
stoppers, flushed with oxygen free nitrogen gas, and then sterilized in an autoclave. The
acidogenesis sludge was then inoculated into the bottles as 10,000 mg/L and was incubated in an
orbital shaker with a rotational rate of 120 rpm and a temperature of 35 ± 1oC.
2.2 Operation of Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor
A continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) as shown in Figure 1 was used in this study to
enrich hydrogen producing bacteria. The total volume of the CSTR is 3L. A complete-mix
condition was achieved with a mechanic mixer at an agitation speed of 120 rpm. The amount of
gases produced in the CSTR due to fermentation was measured with a wet-gas flow meter. The
CSTR and the off-gas flow meter were kept in an air-bath incubator and the temperature was
maintained at 35± 1oC. The influent kitchen waste from fruit and vegetable and part of household
kitchen waste collected from Taipei city, which was stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator at all time and
fed into the CSTR using a peristaltic pump with fill-and-draw operation. The fill-and-draw
operated with 750 mL influent and 750 mL effluent daily to keep a 4-day HRT. In order to avoid
fermentation occurred in the feed tank and to provide sufficient alkalinity required for
neutralizing the acids produced in the CSTR, the pH controller (Suntex pH/ORP controller
PC-330) is set to maintain pH value between 5.3 and 5.6.. The seeding microorganisms for the
CSTR obtained from pilot scale acidogenesis tank in Hong-Gin kitchen waste composition plant,
Hsin-Chu.
Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 15 ml/min. The carbohydrate was
analyzed using the phenol-sulfuric acid method [10] (Herbert et al., 1971). The pH, NH4+-N,
COD (chemical oxygen demand) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were measured according
to standard methods (APHA, 1995).
2.3 Scanning electronic microscope (SEM).
The biopellets were fixed in a solution of 4% glutaraldehyde and 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH
7.2) for 8 hours at 4oC. Specimens were rinsed in the phosphate buffer to remove residual
glutaraldehyde three times, for 10 minutes each time. Dehydration was carried out with a series
if gradually increasing ethanol concentrations: 50, 75, 85, 95, and 100%. Finally, the dehydrated
biopellets were dried using the critical point drier (HITACHI HCP-2) and then coated with gold
by an ion sputter (jeo1 JFC-1100). Microscopic observation was carried out and photographed
extensively to make sure that the predominant microbial population was obtained. This method is
referred to Wu et al., 2001.
2.4 DNA extraction.
A modification of the SDS-based extraction method was used to obtain genomic DNA from the
activated sludge samples, as described elsewhere. The extracted DNA was stored at - 20oC for
later use in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP).
2.5 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the extracted DNA in order to amplify
the 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) genes. The forward primer of EUB 0338
(S-D-Bact-0338-a-S-18, bacterial primer) with a 6-carboxy-fluorescine (FAM) label and the
reverse primer of 1392r (S-*-Univ-1392-a-A-15, universal primer) were used for PCR reactions
[14]. The PCR reaction mixture contained 1X PCR buffer, 0.2 mM of deoxynucleoside
triphosphate (dNTP) (2.5 mM each), 0.2 µM each of forward and reverse primers, 0.5µL of the
DNA template, and 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo Co. Ltd., Otsu, Japan) in a final
volume of 30 µL. Amplification was performed using an automated thermal cycler

3-4 Bio-community analysis by T-RFLP Method
The dynamics of HPB communities were tracked using the 16S rDNA-based TRFLP method.
Figure 6 presents 16S rDNA-based TRFLP electropherograms for the mixed liquor samples taken
from the fermentor operated at different HRTs. At HRT conditions of 24, 9, 6, and 3 hours,
terminal fragment length (TFL) signatures of 231 was found to be dominant in the fermentor.
Only at HRT of 3 hours, additional TFL signatures of 100, 150, and 270 appeared in the
fermentor, suggesting that a more diverse community was enriched. Nevertheless, the TFL
signature of 231 seemed to be presented and dominant at all HRT conditions operated in this
study.
Referring to the expected terminal fragment length (TFL) signatures summarized by
Padmasiri, the 16S rDNA-based TFL signature, as shown in Figure 6, appeared in the samples
taken from the fermentor suggested that Clostrdium clusters I and II lineage (TFL=231) were
dominant bacterial groups at all HRT conditions. Many Clostrdium species are capable in
producing acetic acid, butyric acid and hydrogen from carbohydrate fermentation. In addition,
several studies surveyed microbial communities of anaerobic hydrogen producing systems, using
traditional isolation/identification and/or molecular methods, and demonstrated that Clostrdium
species were dominant bacterial groups and their presence in correlation with hydrogen
production as well. By investigating microbial population dynamics of a continuous flow
reactor, Duangmanee et al. found that Clostrdium clusters I and II organisms were abundant in the
reactor when the hydrogen production was at its maximum and confirmed that Clostridium
clusters I and II contained hydrogen producing microorganisms capable of elevated levels of
hydrogen production. The TRFLP results shown in Figure 6 indicated that Clostridium clusters
I and II, potential HPB groups, presented in the fermentor at all HRT conditions and were,
presumably, responsible for hydrogen production from starch fermentation.

4. CONCLUSION
Highly nutritive composition of kitchen garbage is highly feasible for anaerobic
fermentation with hydrogen production. Based on our results, batch test, morphology observation,
or molecular method detection, the abundant and potential hydrogen producing bacterium existed
in acidogenesis biological system. To get sufficient degradable substrate, shorter hydraulic
retention time and higher organic loading rate are suggested to apply for the hydrogenation
process performance.
Two-stage digester of acidogenesis tank and methanogenesis tank has been developed for
many years. Some of the researches have shown the possible scheme of hydrogen-methane two
stages bio-energy recovery system. National institute of Advanced Industrial Science and
Technology (AIST) in Japan developed world first biogas plant based on two-stage fermentation
process in 2004. By the two-stage process, the high rate and high efficiency of energy recovery is
emphasized. In the future, acidogenesis bioreactor reformed to hydrogen fermentor should be
considered in the opinion of energy recovery.
