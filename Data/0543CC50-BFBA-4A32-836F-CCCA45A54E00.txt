Abstract 
Ferroelectric thin films of Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 (BZT) 
are deposited on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate under various 
substrate temperatures, and formed MFMIS structures 
of Al/BZT/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si. Additionally, ferroelectric 
thin films of SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) are deposited on Si 
substrate under various oxygen concentrations, and 
formed the MFS structure of Al/SBT/Si. The physical 
and electrical characteristics of ferroelectric thin films 
are developed by X-ray diffraction patterns, C-V curves, 
and P-E curves. The BZT thin films show an increase 
of the dielectric constants and remnant polarization 
with increasing substrate temperature. It is also found 
that the oxygen concentration during the depositing 
duration had a large influence on the thin film thickness, 
the dielectric constant, the memory window, and the 
leakage current of SBT ferroelectric thin films. 
 
Introduction 
Recently, ferroelectric random access memories 
(FeRAMs) are considered to be ideal memory devices 
because of their nonvolatile property, low operation 
voltage, large storage capacity and fast read/write speed 
characteristics [1-3]. Many ferroelectric thin-film 
materials are used as gate oxides because they exhibit 
higher remnant polarization and lower coercive field. 
Such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT), SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT), SrTiO3 
(ST), Ba(Zr,Ti)O3 (BZT), and (Ba,Sr)TiO3 (BST) have 
been widely studied and discussed for larger storage 
capacity FeRAM devices [4–8]. Among ferroelectric 
materials, Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) is an important material 
for ferroelectric memory devices because of high 
remanent polarization and low-temperature 
crystallization, whereas it has few serious problems 
such as fatigue and Pb pollution. SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) has 
excellent fatigue-resistance properties on Pt electrodes 
and a low leakage current. The layer structured bismuth 
oxides consist of one to three slabs of perovskite-like 
layers, separated by fluorite-like (Bi2O2)2+ layers. 
Within the bismuth family, Bi-layered perovskite SBT 
is regarded as an attracted candidate because of its 
excellent fatigue endurance against repetitive switching 
of polarization. However, the remnant polarizations of 
SBT thin films are not sufficient for high-density of 
NvRAM, because the SBT ceramics exhibit lower 
Curie temperatures. Additionally, the high 
crystallization temperature of SBT thin films is a 
serious problem for the application for FeRAMs [9]. 
BaTiO3-base materials have received a great deal of 
attention for DRAM applications. It is reported that the 
substitution of Zr for Ti in BaTiO3 can shift the Curie 
temperature below room temperature, and decreases the 
average grain size resulting in the low dielectric 
constant and leakage current [10]. Ba(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (BZT) 
thin films are expected to improve over the common 
PZT memory material because of their lower pollution 
levels, lower deposition temperatures and lower leakage 
current densities as compared to the those of 
conventional PZT perovskite thin films. The subject of 
this work is to study the characteristics of 
Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 and SBT thin films deposited on Si 
substrate using the RF magnetron sputtering method. In 
the study, the characteristics of the 
Al/BZT/Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si (MFMIS) and Al/SBT/Si (MFS) 
structures are reported, and the relationships between 
the electrical properties and various deposition 
parameters are also investigated.  
 
Experimental 
The Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 (BZT) and SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) 
the -20 to 20 V, then returned to -20V, are used to 
measure the C-V characteristics of deposited SBT thin 
films. As Fig. 7 shows, the counterclockwise C-V 
hysteresis loops are apparently observed under various 
oxygen concentrations. The capacitance of deposited 
SBT thin films at 0 V first increases with the increase 
of oxygen concentration and reaches the maximum 
value in the 40 % oxygen atmosphere. Then the 
capacitance slightly decreases in the further increase of 
oxygen to 60 %. The memory windows of MFS 
structure increase from 7.5V to 23V as the oxygen 
concentration increases from 0 to 40%, and then 
decrease to 8V as 60% oxygen concentration is used. A 
larger memory window can be attributed to the 
improvement of oxygen vacancies and the remnant 
polarization of the SBT thin films. 
Fig. 8 shows the leakage current density versus 
electrical field (J-E) curves of SBT thin films deposited 
under various oxygen concentrations. As the oxygen 
concentrations increase, the leakage current density also 
decreases. During the depositing process, the oxygen 
vacancies will appear in the depositing SBT thin films. 
As the oxygen/argon mixtures are used as the 
depositing atmosphere, the defects and oxygen 
vacancies in SBT thin films are filled and compensated 
by oxygen gas. The smallest leakage current density 
will reveal in the 40%-oxygen-deposited SBT thin 
films. The densification of SBT thin films will decrease 
when oxygen concentrations exceed 40%, and result in 
the decrease of dielectric constant and the increase of 
leakage current density. As the applied electrical field 
of 1 MV/cm is used, the leakage current density of SBT 
thin films deposited at 40% oxygen concentration is 
about 2.2×10-8A/cm2. 
 
Conclusion 
The Ba(Zr0.1Ti0.9)O3 (BZT) thin films are deposited 
on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrate using the RF magnetron 
sputtering under various substrate temperatures. It is 
found that the substrate temperatures have large 
influence on the electrical and dielectric characteristics 
of BZT thin films. The dielectric constants and remnant 
polarization of BZT thin films increase with the 
increase of substrate temperatures because of the BZT 
thin films crystalline improvement. The 2Pr and 
coercive field of BZT thin films with 580oC substrate 
temperature are calculated, and they are about 12.7 
μC/cm2 and 221 kV/cm. 
The SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) thin films are also 
successfully deposited on Si substrate using the RF 
magnetron sputtering technology. In this study, the 
surface morphology of SBT thin film do not have too 
great change under different oxygen concentration. 
However, the deposition rate and thickness of SBT thin 
films are affected by different oxygen concentration. 
When the 40% oxygen concentration is used on 
deposited SBT thin films, the maximum memory 
window and the minimal leakage current density of 
Al/SBT/Si (MFS) structure is 23V and 2.2×10-8A/cm2 
respectively. This study shows that the optimal 
atmosphere for depositing the SBT thin films is the 40 
% oxygen concentration.
