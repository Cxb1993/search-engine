31. Introduction
Photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) are typically silica optical fibers in which two-dimensional
periodic structures with a regular array of tiny air holes are introduced in the cladding region and
extend in the axial direction of the fiber [1-3]. Because the properties of photonic crystal fibers
depend on the size and pattern of air holes, various fiber designs are proposed and they possess
several novel properties that are unprecedented in conventional fibers. These novel properties
include endless single mode guiding, extremely high nonlinear optical coefficient, anomalous
dispersion in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges, and enhanced birefringence effect. The
unique dispersion and nonlinear properties of PCFs show potential applications in fiber optic
communication and sensor technology [4]. The desired dispersion and nonlinearity properties of
guided modes in PCFs can be produced by specially designed array of air holes in the fiber cladding
or core [5].
One of the useful applications of PCFs is supercontinuum (SC) generation [6-7].
Supercontinuum is a broadband coherent light source that finds numerous applications in the fields
of telecommunication, optical metrology, spectroscopy and medical imaging [8-10].
Supercontinuum generation in optical fibers is of growing practical and fundamental interest.
Generally, high peak power is the key factor for spectral broadening to result in SC generation in
PCFs. Therefore, femtosecond continuous wave mode-locked lasers are often used as the pumping
sources to generate SC, that only several mini-watts of average power can easily make the peak
power reach a few kilowatts. Applications of supercontinuum in optical fiber communications
might includes pulse compression, multi-wavelength optical sources, all-optical analog-to-digital
conversion, signal conversion between time-division-multiplexing (TDM) format and
wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) format, optical fiber characterization, etc.
In a previous work, we have generated supercontinuum spectra by coupling chirped
Ti:sapphire laser pulses into nonlinear photonic crystal fibers and found that the threshold pump
power for initial build-up as well as the spectral range of supercontinuum depend on the ambient
temperature of fibers [11]. In comparison with the unheated PCF, the heated PCF shifts the blue
edge of supercontinuum spectrum toward the shorter wavelength and slightly improve the slope
efficiency of supercontinuum generation. This should result from the proper compensation of the
pulse chirping for the heated PCF. We believe that by effective cascading of highly nonlinear
photonic crystal fibers, either by sectional heating or by physical connection, could help to broaden
and flatten the supercontinuum spectrum. Recently, we have demonstrated that a picosecond self
Q-switched mode-locked Nd:GdVO4 laser can be used to effectively generate supercontinuum
radiation in a dual zero-dispersion wavelengths microstructured fiber although the pumping
wavelength is 100 nm away from the longer zero-dispersion wavelength, and the fiber length is as
short as 1 meter [12]. Supercontinuum generation from 900 nm to 1400 nm has been
demonstrated. Nonlinear effects, such as modulation instability, stimulated Raman effect, and the
third-order dispersion perturbation at the zero dispersion wavelength sequentially predominates the
SC generation as the pumping power increases.

4. Conclusions
In this project, supercontinuum spectra have been obtained by coupling femtosecond
Ti:sapphire laser pulses into nonlinear photonic crystal fibers. We have studied the generation and
amplification of 1550-nm band ultrashort optical pulses by injecting PCF supercontinuum into an
EDFA. The intensity for amplified SC is larger than ASE from 1500 nm to 1565 nm, especially for
the shorter wavelengths. This phenomenon could be attributed to the larger input intensity in the
shorter wavelength range as well as the 1532-nm gain peak of EDFA. In order to obtain stable and
reduced ASE output from EDFA, supercontinuum conversion efficiency should be enhanced in the
1550-nm band. This could be achieved by using input laser pulses with longer wavelengths as well
as PCFs with longer zero-dispersion wavelengths. With passband selective amplification scheme,
we can obtain ultrashort optical pulses with spectra ranging from near-UV to IR, using only one
laser oscillator.
計畫成果自評
本研究工作大致均按計畫進行，並取得預定成果。目前產生的超寬連續光譜在 1550 nm
波段的強度較弱，使得經摻鉺光纖放大器放大後的超短脈衝峰値功率較不穩定。未來將改用
零色散波長更長的非線性光子晶體光纖，並且搭配波長較長的泵激光源，預計將可獲得穩定
的 1550 nm 波段超短脈衝。本計畫之研究成果和實驗技術未來將可應用在光纖通信、雷射技
術、光譜量測以及感測技術等，作為相關研究領域和技術開發之參考。在光纖通信上，此種
1550 nm 波段的超寬連續光源可用於全光類比數位轉換、TDM-WDM 格式轉換、光纖測試等。
在雷射技術上，則可用於多波段及多波長超短脈衝光源的開發，並且探討其脈衝同步和雜訊
特性等問題。
