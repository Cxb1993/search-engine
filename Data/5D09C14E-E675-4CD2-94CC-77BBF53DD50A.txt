MEASUREMENT DESCRIPTION
The bistatic measuring facility for scattering from very rough surfaces is a stepped-frequency
measurement system capable of measuring the scattering matrix of the measured target by the
transmitting and receiving antenna system. Using the HP8720 vector analyzer with an amplifier on the
transmitter antenna, the system measures a complex voltage for any pair of like- and cross-polarized
receiver and transmitter polarization states. With proper calibration, it is capable of measuring all four
complex elements of the scattering matrix of the target surface. The surfaces are characterized by a
Laser profiler for measuring the surface profiles without direct contact. The receive antenna is a
dual-polarized horn antenna with a beamwidth of 15 degrees and the transmit antenna is a
dual-polarized parabolic dish with narrow beam of 5 degrees. A baffle made of radar absorbing
materials was placed in the direct path between the transmitter and receiver to insure the proper
insulation of the two antennas.
We depict the diagram of the bistatic measuring facility and the measurement system for
depolarized bistatic scattering from very rough surfaces in figure 1. It is a stepped-frequency
measurement system capable of measuring the scattering matrix of the measured target by the
transmitting and receiving antenna system. Using the HP8720 vector analyzer with an amplifier on the
transmitter antenna, the system measures a complex voltage for any pair of like- and cross-polarized
receiver and transmitter polarization states. With proper calibration, it is capable of measuring all four
complex elements of the scattering matrix of the target surface. The hardware allows the transmitter
and receiver to be able to located independently at any point on a hemisphere shell 2 meters from the
center of the target for accurate measurement.
The measurements shown in this paper are for the scattering strength from random rough
surfaces with varying roughness. The surfaces are characterized by a Laser profiler for measuring the
surface profiles without direct contact. The profiler has a horizontal resolution of 1 mm and a vertical
resolution of 2 mm.
The receive antenna is a dual-polarized horn antenna with a beamwidth of 15 degrees and the
transmit antenna is a dual-polarized parabolic dish with narrow beam of 5 degrees. A baffle made of
radar absorbing materials was placed in the direct path between the transmitter and receiver to insure
the proper insulation of the two antennas.
The measured voltage is a complex voltage and is proportional to the scattered electric field for
each polarization state. Because the scattered electric field is composed of a coherent component from
the mean surface and an incoherent component from the rough surface, the measured voltage has also a
coherent and incoherent component. The method to separate the coherent and incoherent components is
based upon the mean value. The mean value of incoherent component is zero. Provided a large number
of independent samples are measured, the coherent power is proportional to the square of the complex
average of the measured voltage and incoherent power is then proportional to the variances of the
fluctuation component of the measured data.

HH like-polarized scattering, the measured data in backscatter enhanced region are larger than the
model prediction. The trend in like polarization is excellent basically. The difference between the
measured data and model prediction is within 3 dB. Basically the good agreements are obtained in
like-polarized measurement.
