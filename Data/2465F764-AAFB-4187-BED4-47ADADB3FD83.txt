Abstract 
In this experiment, a radio frequency 
dual ion beam sputtering (DIBS) system 
was used to prepare LiAlO2 films with 
ZnO/ITO/AZOY bottom electrode on a Si 
(100) substrate.  After  systematic  
testing of processing variables,  a  high  
quality  nanometer structure film with  
preferred texture  was  grown  
successfully  on  Si  (100)  substrate  
with  ZnO  bottom electrode  under from 
650 to 700 eV energy flux, 10-20 sccm 
oxygen gas flow and 5x10-4 torr in vacuum. 
However, and the ITO bottom electrode is 
not observed the LiAlO2 crystallined.  
Generally LiAlO2 films prepared by DIBS 
are decided by electrode material structure, 
oxygen flow rate, temperature and beam 
energy. The characteristics of the deposited 
LiAlO2 thin film were studied by X-Ray 
diffraction (XRD) and Transmission 
Electron Microscope (TEM).

Introduction 
AlN film has a wide application in 
microelectronic devices because of its high 
thermal conductivity, high electrical 
resistivity and attractive mechanical 
properties [1]. In addition, AlN film is a 
candidate material of UV light emitter by the 
wide band gap energy [2,3]. Its fast acoustic 
velocity (5600m/s) is especially attractive in 
films deposition prepared by DIBS are 
showing in Figures 1  to 6. Fig. 1 reveals 
that the crystallization of LiAlO2 films under 
oxygen gas flow from 10 to 20 sccm at 
700eV, 300oC using a ZnO bottom electrode, 
and the cubic (γ) were obtained in those 
condition. However, the crystallization of 
LiAlO2 films is decrease with the oxygen 
flow rate increase. This means indicate that 
the LiAlO2 films deposited rate is decrease 
with the oxygen flow rate increase. However, 
based on the previous study of Huang [19], 
the oxygen flow rate in case of too low to the 
LiAlO2 films   is amorphous. These results 
show the crystallized of LiAlO2 thin film is 
depend on the oxygen gas flow rate. Fig. 2 
exhibits the LiAlO2 thin film deposit on 
various bottom electrodes at 700eV, 60mA, 
15sccm 300oC. The result shows that the 
ZnO and AZOY bottom electrodes is cubic (γ) 
(200) texture, bur the ITO bottom electrode is 
amorphous structure. These results are due to 
the lattice misfit of interface between bottom 
electrode and LiAlO2 film.  Fig. 3 shows the 
deposited LiAlO2 film at various beam 
energy in condition of 300oC, oxygen gas 
flow 15 sccm on ZnO bottom electrode. The 
Figure show that the cubic (γ) (101) texture at 
beam energy is 750eV and cubic (γ) (200) 
texture at beam energy is both 700eV and 
650eV. It is revealed that the LiAlO2 film 
deposited rate is depended on beam energy. 
At the same time, the beam energy is also 
determined the film texture.  Fig. 4 exhibits 
the deposited of LiAlO2 films at 700eV, 
60mA and oxygen gas flow 15 sccm at 
various temperatures in using a ZnO bottom 
electrode. At 200oC, the LiAlO2 film 
crystallization is smaller than 300oC at same 
condition in spite of with (002) texture of 
LiAlO2 films. However, there are random 
crystallized of LiAlO2 film at 400oC. These 
result are shown that LiAlO2 films is not only 
depended on beam energy but also is 
determined by temperature. Fig 5 shows the 
crystallization of LiAlO2 films at 700eV, 
300oC, 20 sccm in using a ZnO bottom 
electrode in condition of pre-sputter 30 
minutes or not pre-sputter. It is show the 
LiAlO2 films is crystallized with (002) 
texture at both of pre-sputter or not. However, 
the LiAlO2 films crystallization at pre-sputter 
30 minutes is better than no pre-sputter. Fig. 
6 indicates the LiAlO2 films deposited on 
ITO bottom electrode at various oxygen flow 
rate. The result illustrates the LiAlO2 films is 
amorphous in spite of the oxygen gas flow 
rate. Compared the crystallized structure 
using variety kinds electrode, such as ZnO, 
AZOY and ITO, the results reveal the 
crystallized characterization is excellent for 
ZnO/AZOY electrode.  it is not only can 
persuade that due to lattice mismatched 
between electrode and LiAlO2, and different 
thermal expansion of electrode and LiAlO2 , 
but also is decide to the oxygen dense in 
interfacial between electrode and LiAlO2 
films. In addition, the factors of temperature, 
beam energy and pre-sputter are also affect 
the film character.  
The microstructure analyses of the films 
were examined by TEM Fig. 6 shows the 
cross-section of film pattern at energy flux of 
700eV, 60mA, 300oC and oxygen 15 sccm. In 
Fig. 7(a), the select area diffraction pattern 
(SACP) is consistent to XRD (Fig. 1) and the
