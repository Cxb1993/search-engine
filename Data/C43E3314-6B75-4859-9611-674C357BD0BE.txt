thermal modifications for FePd (001) films 
deposited directly onto MgO (001) surfaces 
at a relatively low final process temperature 
of 400 oC. Thus, we claim a way to control 
the microstructure and magnetization 
behavior in ordered FePd system via 
different thermal modifications. 
 
三、研究方法與步驟 (Experiments) 
Fe/Pd multilayers composed of [Fe (x 
nm)/Pd (1 nm)]n film structures with 
different layer numbers n (n= 20, 15, 12, and 
10) were fabricated by electron-beam 
deposition system onto the MgO (001) 
single-crystal substrates under a vacuum of 
5×10-9 Torr. The thickness of Fe layer x (x= 
0.5~2) in the Fe/Pd multilayers was varied 
from 0.5, 1, 1.5 to 2 nm to change the 
off-stoichiometric compositions in the range 
of 38~58 at. % Fe, and the Pd layer 
thickness is fixed at 1 nm. All thicknesses of 
FePd films were fixed at 30 nm that grown 
at the process temperature of 400 oC (Tg). In 
comparison with staged thermal 
modification effects on the microstructure 
and magnetization reversal behavior of the 
FePd films, the FePd films were grown at 
100 oC (Tg), and then post-annealed at the 
same final process temperature of 400 oC (Ta) 
for 1 hr to study the distinction during 
different thermal modifications. 
 
四、結果與討論 (Results and discussion) 
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns (θ-2θ
scans) for [Fe (x nm)/Pd (1 nm)]n film 
structures with Fe thickness (x) ranged from 
0.5, 1, 1.5 to 2 nm and layer numbers n (n= 
20, 15, 12, and 10) grown at 400 oC, 
respectively. The corresponding 
relationships between Fe thickness and the 
composition of FePd films are Fe38Pd62 1(a), 
Fe44Pd56 1(b), Fe52Pd48 1(c), and Fe58Pd42 
1(d), respectively. In addition to the 
fundamental (002) peak, (001) and (003) 
superlattice peaks of the L10 ordered FePd  
phase have been clearly observed for all 
films. In Fig. 1, only (00n) diffraction peaks 
are observed in the diffraction patterns, 
indicating all the FePd films are strongly

The corresponding compositions for all FePd films 
are identified to be (a) Fe38Pd62, (b) Fe44Pd56, (c)

textured to the (001) planes and also confirm 
the structures epitaxially grown on the MgO 
substrate. The intensities of (002) 
fundamental peak of the FePd phase is 
getting stronger with increasing Fe 
concentration from 38 to 52 at. %, while the 
intensities of (001) and (003) superlattice 
peaks of the ordered FePd phase are also 
increased. The FePd (002) peak shifts to 
high-angle side, indicating the Pd sites in the 
ordered structure are partly replaced by Fe 
atoms with increasing Fe concentration, 
resulting in the shrinkage of the lattice 
spacing of the c plane. The intensities of 
FePd superlattice peaks take maxima at 52 
at. % Fe, indicating the composition of 
Fe52Pd48 with more highly ordered state that 
reaches a highest chemical ordering degree 
in FePd (001) films. With further increase Fe 
concentration up to 58 at. %, the intensities 
of fundamental and superlattice peaks 
decrease to the minimum that indicates the 
degradation of L10-ordered phase.

Fig. 4. X-ray diffraction patterns (θ-2θ scans) of 
FePd (002) and FePd (202) peaks those obtained by 
Gaussian fitting for the FePd films grown at 400 oC. 
The conventional θ-2θ scan was 
employed to determine the lattice constant in 
the normal direction to the film plane (c-axis) 
and the degree of long-range chemical order 
(S). In addition, the θ-2θ scan in the tilted 
sample was also performed using four-axes 
goniometer in order to determine the 
in-plane lattice constant (a-axis). So the 
XRD θ-2θ scans around FePd (002) and 
FePd (202) peaks were performed using a 
single crystal diffractometer with high 
accuracy of θ= ±0.005° so as to determine 
the lattice constants c and a of the FePd unit 
cell accurately. As mentioned above, the 
samples were tilted and (202) diffraction 
peaks were observed in order to measure the 
in-plane lattice constant. Figure 4 shows the 
diffraction patterns of the (a) FePd (002) 
and (b) FePd (202) diffraction peaks 
obtained from XRD θ-2θ scans for the FePd 
films grown at 400 oC. The corresponding 
2θ angles of FePd (002) and FePd (202) 
diffraction peaks are obtained by Gaussian 
fitting to be 49.536° and 71.504°, 
respectively, leading to c= 0.3678 nm and 
a= 0.3784 nm. Therefore, c/a ratio is 
calculated to be 0.972, which is larger than 
0.966 for stoichiometric bulk L10 FePd. 
Fig. 5. The lattice constants of a and c planes (a), 
tetragonal c/a ratio (b), and long-range order degree S 
(c) for the FePd films as a function of the Fe content. 
Figure 5 summarizes the lattice constants 
of a and c (a), the tetragonal ratio of c/a (b), 
and the long-range order parameter S (c) as a 
function of Fe concentration for FePd (001) 
films grown at 400 oC. With increasing Fe 
concentration, the values of c decrease as 
seen in Fig. 5(a). On the other hand, the 
value of a decreases monotonically and 
remains almost constant for Fe 
concentration between 38 and 52 at. %, and 
then decreases to a minimum for 58 at. % Fe 
content. The c/a ratio decreases with 
increasing the concentration of Fe and the 
minimum (c/a= 0.972) occurs at 52 at. % Fe 
content as shown in Fig. 5 (b). The degree 
of chemical ordering reaches maxima (S = 
0.75 ± 0.05) for Fe concentration at 52 at. %, 
where c/a holds a minimum as shown in Fig. 
5 (c). The degree of chemical ordering (S) of 
FePd films was evaluated from the 
integrated intensities of (001) superlattice 
and (002) fundamental peaks extracted by 
numerical fitting, and the detailed procedure 
for the evaluation of S was described 
elsewhere. Above results indicate that the 
different compositions could provide 
different strain energy arising from the 
lattice mismatch between the FePd films and 
the MgO substrates. The atomic plane that

magnetic domain images for Figs. 7(a) and

image changed from well defined straight 
domains to irregular and bubble domains 
with increasing initial growth temperature. 
According to the results mentioned above, 
the distinct changes in the magnetic 
properties, surface and domain structures of 
the FePd films are due to the different 
thermodynamic growth process even the 
whole process condition kept at the same 
final temperature of 400 oC. 
Shown in Figs. 8 are the FE-SEM surface 
micrographs for FePd films (a) grown at 100 
oC and then annealed at 400 oC for 1 hr; (b) 
grown at 400 oC, respectively. The surface 
morphology of the FePd films grown at 100 
oC and then annealed at 400 oC is connected 
with each other, and the structure looks like 
a continuous film shown in Fig. 8(a). On the 
other hand, the surface morphology changes 
from continuous to nanogranular structures 
when the FePd films initially grown at 400 
oC as shown in Fig. 8(b). FePd L10 
nanogranular structures are aligned along 
the direction of MgO [100]. The major facet 
planes are (100) and (010). A noticeable 
change in the surface morphology of the

at 100 oC and then post-annealed at 400 oC for 1 hr, 
and (b) grown at 400 oC, respectively. 
FePd films is observed during different 
thermal modifications, leading to distinct 
magnetic performance even kept at the final 
process temperature of 400 oC. The change 
in the FePd surface morphology is 
originated from the change of interfacial 
energy with large temperature dependence 
between FePd and MgO (σFePd/MgO), which 
also changes the mobility of the FePd atoms 
on the MgO surface and eventually 
determines its growth mechanism. The 
mobility of the FePd atoms increases with 
increasing the initial growth temperature 
(Tg), and the morphology of FePd film 
changes from continuous to island growth 
mode which has a minimum energy. The 
island boundaries of FePd single domain 
particles will work as functional pinning 
sites for the magnetic domain wall motion 
thus enhance coercivity. 
 
五、結論 (Conclusions) 
In summary, the highest ordering degree 
in perpendicularly magnetized FePd (001) 
films with Fe compositional shift is at the 
composition of Fe52Pd48. Even at the same 
final process temperature of 400 oC, the 
FePd films could exhibit distinct structure 
and magnetic properties caused by varied 
interfacial energy during staged 
thermodynamic modifications. This present

impede the domain-wall motion. With the pinning effects, both 
the out-of-plane and in-plane coercivities increase as compared 
with those of the film without Cu capping layer. The angular 
dependence of coercivity was used to investigate the 
magnetization reversal of the FePt films without and with 2 nm, 
4 nm and 6 nm thick Cu capping layers as shown in Fig. 4.  
From above results indicate a tendency toward weakened 
domain-wall motion behavior, but an enhanced rotation mode 
mechanism in the magnetization reversal process, via the 
introduction of a Cu single layer over the FePt thin films, 
which may decouple the intergrain interaction between the 
FePt neighboring grains. The reduction of magnetic domain 
size and intergrain interaction of FePt films can be achieved by 
such Cu capping layer and maintain (001) texture. The reduced 
size of domains are less magnetically coupled in the rotation 
mode and the reversal of magnetization is more independent as 
identified with ΔM measurement (from positive to negative) 
and initial magnetization curves as shown in Fig. 5. 
This present study showed the Cu single layer on top of the 
FePt films that could reduce the intergranular exchange 
coupling and thus enhance the coercivity. It has been found 
that by depositing a Cu layer on top of FePt films the size of 
magnetic domains of FePt films can be effectively reduced. 
Studies on the angular dependence of coercivity revealed that 
increased the thickness of Cu top layer on the FePt films, the 
magnetization reversal mechanism was observed to shift from 
the domain-wall motion behavior to be closer to the rotation 
mode dominated in the FePt films. Thus, the FePt film with Cu 
top layer is effective to reduce the coupling strength and lower 
noise for applications of magnetic recording nanodevices.

By comparing TEM images of the oleic acid and oleylamine 
capped with FePt and with thiol and MUA-exchanged NPs as 
shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), it can be observed that the NPs 
dispersed in hexane tend to self-assemble maintaining a regular 
distance between them, whereas in the thiol and MUA-
exchanged NPs, there is no sign of pattern, indicating that the 
FePt NPs slightly agglomerate after the ligand exchange. Fig. 5 
shows FTIR spectra for the NPs after ligand exchange with 
thiol and MUA. The peaks at 3031 and 3401 cm-1 are observed 
corresponded to thiol and MUA cases, which confirm the 
mercapto group bonded to FePt surface after ligand exchange. 
 
This present study showed the chemically synthetic FePt 
nanoparticles with monodispersity and controllable surface 
properties. The water-soluble FePt NPs are generally 
considered to be biocompatibility via ligand exchange by thiol 
and MUA those could be potentially used for the applications 
including magnetic, catalytic, and biological fields in future. 
We think that such hydrophilic FePt NPs to provide a biotin 
moiety for specific interaction with DNA, antibody or protein 
that will be of great aid in the development for future 
applications in life sciences.
