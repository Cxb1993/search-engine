Abstract 
Drinking water quality in southern 
Taiwan receives complain from customers 
for a long time for its unpleasant odors. 
Earthy/musty and fishy odors were the two 
major odor groups in many drinking water 
sources. Although cyanobacteria and 
diatoms were the mostly likely algae 
responsible for the odors, the chemicals 
and algal species remain unknown. To 
improve the odor removal efficiency for 
the water treatment plants (WTPs), the 
sources and chemicals for those odors 
must be understood. 
In this three-year study, the 
responsible algal species were first 
separated and cultured for the 
representative source waters in south 
Taiwan. Both sensory and instrument 
analysis method were employed to 
determine the similarity of the odorants 
generated from the cultured algae solution 
and in the dissolved and particle (within 
algae) odorants in both the conventional 
treatment processes and oxidation, and 
three oxidation process (chlorination, 
permanganation, ozonation) were also be 
investigated. 
The research results in the first year 
are listed below: 
1. The earthy/musty odor compound, 
geosmin and 2-MIB were identified 
using SPME coupled with GC/MS.  
2. The removal rate of 2-MIB was 
understood during treatment processes 
of water treatment plants. 
3. The oxidation kinetics of 2-MIB by 
chlorination, permanganation, ozonation 
were established. 
4. A 2-MIB-producing cyanobacterium 
was isolated from the Kao-Ping Creek, 
and was identified as Planktothrix genus 
according to microscope observation. 
5. A fishy odor compound heptanal which 
remains in the algal cells was identified 
with sensory GC coupled with 
GC/MSD. 
 
The research results in the second year 
are described as below: 
1.The effects environmental parameters on 
2-MIB production by the Planktothrix sp. 
were studied.  
2.The cell damage of Planktothrix sp. and 
release of intracellular 2-MIB during 
oxidation processes were characterized. 
3.A sensory GC was employed to identify 
the odorants producing by three purified 
actinomycetes isolated from Feng-Shen 
Reservoir. 
 
The research results in the last year are 
stated as below: 
1. The 2-MIB and/or geosmin producing 
actinomycetes were identified with 
molecular biological technologies. 
2. The effects of temperature on the 
growth and odorants production for the 
three actinomycetes strains were 
studied. 
3. A woody odors, β-cyclocitral, was 
identified using sensory GC coupled 
with GC/MSD for several resevoirs

(Streptomyces genus) 及 土 壤 絲 狀 菌
(Nocardia genus) 等放線菌中分離出
Geosmin，目前除了放線菌外，已知藍綠
細菌門中的顫藻屬(Oscillatoria)(Naes et 
al.1985) 、 依 沙 束 絲 藻 屬
(Aphanizonmena)(Juttner, 1984)及魚腥藻
屬 (Anabaena) 等 都 被 發 現 能 產 生
Geosmim。 
 
(3)魚腥味  
在台灣地區南部夏季是以土霉味為
主要臭味，在秋冬季時則以魚腥味居
多，冬季時原水中魚腥味之嗅覺層次分
析法(Flavor profile analysis, FPA)強度甚
至可高達 12(林與汪, 2000)。而產生魚腥
味的主要原因大多是因為冬季時水庫大
量的矽藻繁殖所造成的，水中常見的矽
藻 Synedra 和 Melosira 均會造成魚腥味
(Persson, 1983)，若水源中含有大量的小
型甲殼類動物，也會使水體中有強烈的
魚腥臭(Lin, 1976)。根據李氏等人(1985)
及陳氏及曾氏(1986)之研究，推斷南部地
區水源中造成魚腥味的主要原因可能是
由 Melosira 與 Synedra 等兩種矽藻所造
成，汪氏(2000)也發現澄清湖的魚腥味多
發生在冬季，此季節為矽藻的繁殖期，
以 Synedra、Melosira granulata 和 M. 
italica 為優勢藻種。 
 
Suffet (1995)指出可能會造成魚腥
味的物質多是一些醛類及胺類，如
n-henxanal、n-heptanal、heptadienals 及
decadienals。 
 
(4) 木頭味 
  β-cyclocitral (2,2,6- trimethyl-1- 
cyclohexene -1-carboxaldehyde)也是藻
類代謝之臭味物質之一，屬於木頭味
(Young et al., 1999)，曾經被發現存在於
自來水系統中，並且造成自來水中異臭
味問題 (Juttner, 1976 ; Slater and Block, 
1983; Suffet et al., 1999)。目前已知
β-cyclocitral 主要是由屬於藍綠藻的微
囊藻 (Microcystis spp.)所產生 (Juttner, 
1976) ， Juttner 也在實驗室中培養
Microcystis wesenbergii 發 現
β-cyclocitral 為其主要產生的揮發性代
謝物。 
 
2-2 環境因子對微生物生成 2-MIB 或
geosmin 的影響 
水體環境中影響放線菌生長的因子
主要有溫度、酸鹼值、營養鹽、碳源、
溶氧及孢子的生成，一般實驗室培養時
控制的條件有溫度及營養鹽。而影響藍
綠細菌的環境因子為照度、溫度、酸鹼
值、營養鹽、螯合劑，實驗室培養藍綠
細菌常控制的條件包括照度、溫度及氮
與磷營養鹽。茲將影響微生物生成臭味
物質的重要因子分述如下： 
 
(1)照度 
藍綠藻代謝生成臭味物質受光照度
的影響，因培養種類的差異而有極大的
變化。Blevin et al. (1995、2001) 與 Ploeg 
et al. (1995) 研究發現單位生物質量或
葉綠素 a 的臭味物質在某一照度下有最
大值，太低或太高都會降低臭味物質的
生成。Tsuchiya 與 Matsumoto(1999)也發
現，Oscillatoria f. granulaya 的 geosmin、
2-MIB 生成量在 1000 lux 大於 500 lux 與
2000 lux。 
 
(2)溫度 
藻類在高溫時生成的葉綠素 a 越
多，Blevins 等人(1995)發現 Anabaena sp.
在高溫時，植醇(phytol)的需求增加而導
致 geosmin 的生成量降低； Saadoum 等
人(2001)培養的Anabaena sp.單位葉綠素
之 geosmin 隨溫度(15~30℃)的增加而降
低。 
 6
 
2-3 氧化劑對產臭藻體之影響 
氧化法採用水廠常用的三種氧化劑
進行試驗，分別為 Cl2、KMnO4、O3。這
三種氧化劑雖有氧化水中臭味物質的能
力，但是由於藍綠細菌生成的臭味物質
geosmin 與 2-MIB，胞內的濃度通常大於
胞外，因此，當氧化劑破壞細胞後，將
使臭味物質釋放於水體。Ashitani 等人
(1988)研究指出前加氯，將使水中的
2-MIB 去除率降低，原因為胞內物釋出
導致去除率降低。Peterson 等人(1995)以
化學物質與Aphanizomenon flos-aquae作
用，發現氯與重鉻酸鉀等氧化劑使胞內
的 geosmin 釋出。 
 
三、研究方法 
   本 研 究 以 化 學 分 析 法
SPME/GC-MSD 分析與確定水源中土霉
味物質及其他臭味物質(如魚腥味物質
與木頭味物質)，而以嗅覺氣相層析儀判
定水體中的氣味。微生物之純化與培養
的對象為自來水原水中與土臭味有關之
藍綠細菌與放線菌，並以分子生物的技
術搭配掃描式電子顯微鏡的觀察，確認
放線菌的菌種。控制方法則主要探討氧
化劑對產臭藻種與放線菌及胞內臭味物
質控制的效能。 
 
3-1 臭味物質的定性與定量分析 
2-Methylisoborenel(2-MIB) 與
geosmin 以固相微萃取法 (Solid-phase 
micro-extraction, SPME)進行濃縮，再配
合氣相層析儀(GC/MSD)進行定性與定
量分析。GC/MSD 參數的設定則參照環
檢所公告的標準方法(NIEA W537.50B)。 
 
嗅覺氣相層析法(sensory GC)是除了
FPA 以外另一種感官分析法。此方法已
成功的應用於香水與食品工業。圖 3-1
為嗅覺氣相層析儀(Sensory GC)與氣相
層析儀(GC/MS)的設備圖，本實驗在氣
相層析儀中裝設兩支層析管柱，一支管
柱出口為質譜儀，另外一支管柱出口為
聞測杯。 
 
分析樣品中未知之異味時，一般作
法是使用兩支相同之吸附纖維，在相同
之條件下分別於兩個氣提瓶中吸附相同
水樣，吸附完畢後，將兩支纖維同時注
入 GC/MS，當分析開始約三分鐘後，聞
測人員即可於聞測杯處聞測出流之氣
味，並且將各種氣味之出流時間及氣味
描述加以記錄，另一方面質譜儀會偵測
出流物質之質譜，再與化學物質質譜資
料庫(Library)比對，不同時間的波鋒可能
的化學名稱及結構式。最後以 Sensory 
GC 聞測到的物質，與 GC/MS 分析到的
物質做比對，可找出不同的氣味所對應
的化學物質，最後則須以標準品的停留
時間做確認。 
 
 
 
 
3-2 純種藍綠藻的培養與藻細胞計數 
本研究使用 modified BG11(Stanier 
et al., 1971)大量培養產臭的顫藻與微囊
藻。本研究採用葉綠素 a 作為生物質量
的參考值，分析方法依照環檢署公告的
乙醇萃取法(NIEA E508.00B)。

四、結果與討論 
綜合三年的研究成果，共分離出產
2-MIB 與/或 geosmin 的藍綠細菌一株及
放線菌三株，並探討環境因子對其生長
與產臭特性的影響，另外，也利用自來
水常用的三種氧化劑氧化藍綠細菌及放
線菌細胞，以了解氧化劑對細胞破壞及
胞內物質釋出的影響。此外，關於水體
中的魚腥味物質及木頭味物質也有相關
化學物質之發現。詳細的內容將在下文
中說明。 
 
4-1 產臭的藍綠細菌 
本研究自高屏溪的藻華分離出一株
產 2-MIB 的藍綠細菌，經光學顯微鏡判
定其為顫藻屬(原為 Oscillatoria sp.，現
為 Planktothrix)，圖為其顯微照片。環境
因子對其生長及產臭特性的影響詳如
後： 
 
 
圖 4-1. Plankothrix sp.之顯微照片 
 
 (1)溫度 
由長期對環境水樣的調查分析，發
現水體中 2-MIB 的濃度受溫度的影響非
常顯著，因此本研究針對純化的藻種
Planktothrix sp.培養於不同的溫度，以探
討溫度對純藻生成 2-MIB 的影響，培養
溫度分別為 20、25 及 30°C，此溫度範
圍涵蓋環境水體中的最高與最低溫，照
度固定為 1000 lux，培養 7 天後，由圖
4-2 可發現溫度與 2-MIB 及葉綠素 a 的
濃度呈現明顯的正相關，然而單位質量
葉綠素 a 所產生的 2-MIB 量似乎不受溫
度影響，約為 250~300 ng 2-MIB/µg chl 
a，由此結果可判斷當溫度增加導致
2-MIB 的濃度增加是因為藻體細胞量增
加所致，溫度對單位藻類質量的臭味物
質影響因藻種不同而異，例如 O.CF. 
chalybea (Ploeg et al.，1995)單位蛋白質
的 2-MIB 量隨溫度的增加而小幅度的增
加(21.5~28°C)。Hu (1998)分離培養的 A. 
sp.，溫度範圍 (15、25、35°C)，geosmin、
2-MIB 的濃度在 25°C 最高。Saadoum 等
人(2001)培養的 A. sp.單位細胞乾重的
geosmin 在 20°C (15~30°C)最大。 
 
(2)照度 
培養的照度分別控制照光面在
1000 、2000 及 3000 lux，由圖 4-3 可發
現在 1000 lux 增加至 2000 lux 時，總
2-MIB 濃度增為 1.5 倍，葉綠素 a 的濃度
增為 1.4 倍，而由 2000 lux 增至 3000 
lux，總 2-MIB 與葉綠素 a 僅增加為 1.1
倍。而單位質量葉綠素 a 所產生的 2-MIB
量隨照度的增加而增加。由文獻中可發
現藍綠細菌生成土霉味物質受光照度的
影響，因培養的菌種不同而有相當的差
 10
4-9(a)可發現溫度對 S. malaysiensis 的生
長影響不顯著(383-415 mg/l)，但 geosmin 
及 2-MIB 的濃度隨著溫度的上升有明
顯的增加。而 S. caelestis 的生長與 2-MIB
產量皆受溫度影響，且與溫度成正相
關。此結果與 Blevins et al. (1995)及
Dioigi 與 Ingram (1994)的研究結果雷
同，他們發現最適合 Spreptomyces 
species 生長的溫度也是在 30°C。另一研
究者 Aoyama (1990)也發現 S. griseofusus
在 32°C 時 2-MIB 與 gesomin 的產量最
大，分別為 1,500 ng/ml 和 1,250 ng/ml。 
 
圖 4-11(a) 可看出 S. roseoflavus 
geosmin 的產量小於 100 ng/l，最佳的生
長溫度在 25°C，而在 30°C，geosmin 的
產量最高。Weete 等人  (1977)培養
Streptomyces spp.也發現最大的生物質量
與臭味物質產量發生在不同的溫度，他
們觀察在 30°C 是最佳的生長溫度，而在
25°C，geosmin 的產量最大。 
 
關於胞內外臭味物質的分佈可見圖
4-9(b)、 4-10(b)，當溫度增加時， S. 
malaysiensis 與 S. caelestis.保留較大量
的臭味物質在胞內，30°C 時，約有 55%
的 2-MIB、geosmin 在細胞內。而本研究
中，S. roseoflavus 的 geosmin 產量偏低，
胞內的 geosmin 不及 10%，見圖 4-11(b)。
相較於溫度對放線菌的影響研究，鮮少
研究者進行胞內外 geosmin、2-MIB 分佈
的探討。然而在淨水廠處理程序中，臭
味物質在胞內外的分佈是非常重要的，
若因前處理導致胞內物的釋出，將會增
加後續處理單元的負荷，因此應採用如
混凝等方法先移除產臭細胞，以免在氧
化等過程致臭味物質釋出。本研究發現
放線菌胞內的 2-MIB 或 geosmin 含量大
約 10%~55%，此結果和 Pollak 與 Berger 
(1996)的研究相似，他們發現 S. citreus
細胞內保留 10%~30%的 geosmin。 
 
圖 4-9(b)、4-10(b)及 4-11(b)為單位
乾重的 geosmin 與 2-MIB 產率(G/B，
M/B)，很明顯的 G/B、M/B 的值隨溫度
與菌種的不同而有很大的差異。在
30°C，S. malaysiensis 有最大的 G/B (4.5 
ng/mg) 及 M/B (2.4 ng/mg)，S. caelestis 
的 M/B 值 隨 溫 度 的 增 加 而 增 加
(0.24-0.96 ng/mg)，上述兩菌種，30°C 的
產率約為 20°C 的四倍，而 S. roseoflavus
在 30°C 的 G/B 值(0.2 ng/mg)是 20°C 的
十倍。 
 
研究中分離的三株鏈黴菌2-MIB與
geosmin 的產量分別為 10-1,900 ng/l 與 
100-1,000 ng/l，此值近似於 Zaitlin et al. 
(2003)研究的數株鏈黴菌，6~670 ng/l 
geosmin 及 8 ~ 2,300 ng/l 2-MIB。然而
G/B與M/B 值相較於其他的研究卻顯然
偏低，如 Blevins et al. (1995)發現 S. 
halstedii 在 35°C 之 G/B 直達 75.6 
ng/mg，Frauke and Berger (1996)也發現
S. citreus 在 25°C 的 G/B 值更高達 800 
ng/mg，但本研究的 S. malaysiensis 擁有
最大的 G/B 值也僅 4.4 ng/mg。此差異可
能是因實驗的菌株與培養條件不同所引
起，Schrader and Blevins (2001)就曾探討
培養基中的碳源對 S. halstedii 生長及產
臭特性的影響，結果顯示以葡萄糖碳源
會抑制 geosmin 的生成，因為葡萄糖為
澱粉的水解產物，而本研究使用澱粉為
碳源導致臭味物質產量降低。 
 
(2)孢子的形成 
本研究也發現放線菌生成孢子與否
亦會影響臭味物質代謝物的生成，S. 
malaysiensis 與  S. caelestis 在 30°C 
 12
對相同的藻屬進行臭氧試驗，卻有不同
的結果， 3mg/L 的臭氧劑量即導致
Scendesmus quadricauda 細胞壁嚴重受
損，但對於 Cyclotella sp.沒有造成嚴重
的損害，此差異也許與試驗水樣的水質
或是藻種特性有關。本研究純化的顫藻
經臭氧氧化後，以光學顯微鏡觀察，發
現細胞並未受到明顯的破壞，當劑量低
時，細胞仍保持完整的型態，劑量增加
時，除了葉綠素降低外，同時也發先細
胞的間隔更明顯，且胞內物有聚集的現
象。 
 
(2)氯與高錳酸鉀-Plankothrix 
圖 4-13 與圖 4-14 分別為藻體經氯
與高錳酸鉀作用 60 分鐘後，總 2-MIB
濃度，胞外 2-MIB 濃度及胞內鉀離子釋
出的變化情形。由結果可發現鉀離子與
胞外 2-MIB 濃度的增加率幾乎是一致
的，可見這兩種氧化劑對細胞造成了某
些程度的傷害，而導致胞內的物質釋
出。其中又以氯對藻體的破壞力較強，
藻體於 1 mg/L 氯的作用下，胞外 2-MIB
的量由 25%增加至 85%，劑量增為 5 
mg/L，除了細胞的葉綠素被破壞，胞內
的 2-MIB 幾乎完全釋出。而高錳酸鹽於
1 mg/L 時，藻體細胞並沒有明顯的傷
害，致胞外的 2-MIB 及鉀離子未增加，5 
mg/L/使胞外 2-MIB 的量增為 90%，葉綠
素亦未被完全降解。然而此兩種氧化劑
對總 2-MIB 的氧化力是有限的，去除率
不及 10%。Tung 等人(2004)發現富含藍
綠藻體的混合培養液，2 mg/L 的氯使溶
解性的 2-MIB 增加 60%，而 2 mg/L 的高
錳酸鹽使溶解性的 2-MIB 僅增加 15%，
但 Peterson 等人 (1995)卻發現小於 1 
mg/L 的 高 錳 酸 鹽 即 會 造 成
Aphanizomenon flos-aquae 細胞膜被破
壞，胞內 geosmin 釋出。雖然這兩種氧
化劑對不同的藻種傷害程度有些差異，
但是其對藻細胞的破壞，而致胞內物的
釋出是無庸置疑的。 
 
(3)臭氧- Steptomyces 
   將 pH 值以 NaOH 調整至 8，以臭氧
氧化 S. malaysiensis，反應中所添加的臭
氧劑量為 1.78 mg/L-min，總 2-MIB 初始
濃度為 156 ng/L，溶解態 2-MIB 初始濃
度為 126 ng/L(占 80.8%)；總 geosmin 初
始濃度為 344 ng/L，溶解態 geosmin 初
始濃度為 276 ng/L(占 80.2%)。如圖
4-15(a)所示，總 2-MIB 在 pH 為 8 時，
去除率不佳，氧化 10 分鐘後，總 2-MIB
的去除率只有 30.5%；總 geosmin 的去除
率只有 32.0%。 
 
同樣將 pH 值以 NaOH 調整至 8，
臭氧與產 2-MIB 的 S. caelestis 反應結果
如圖 4-15(b)，反應中所添加的臭氧劑量
為 1.62 mg/L-min，2-MIB初始濃度為 253 
ng/L，溶解態 2-MIB 初始濃度為 127 
ng/L(占 50.2%)。如圖所示，總 2-MIB 在
pH 為 8 時，氧化 10 分鐘後，總 2-MIB
的去除率只有 27.0%。 
 
(4)氯- Steptomyces 
    以 次 氯 酸 鈉 氧 化 產 2-MIB 及
geosmin 的 S. malaysiensis，採用為 1 
mg/L、2 mg/L 及 5 mg/L NaOCl as Cl2，
進行批次反應，氧化時間 1 小時，氧化
結果如圖 4-16(a)所示。總 2-MIB 初始濃
度為 47.4ng/L，溶解態 2-MIB 初始濃度
為 31.9ng/L(占 67.3%)；總 GEM 初始濃
度為 117.9ng/L，溶解態 GEM 初始濃度
為 71.2ng/L(占 60.4%)。總 2-MIB及GEM
的濃度隨著次氯酸鈉的濃度升高而有下
降的趨勢，且因次氯酸鈉破壞放線菌細
胞，造成放線菌細胞內的 2-MIB 及 GEM
釋出，而導致溶解態 2-MIB 與 GEM 濃
度皆有上升的趨勢。但次氯酸鈉對於放
線菌產生的 2-MIB 及 GEM 去除效率不
 14
 
    由 上 述 結 果 可 知 6-Methyl-2- 
heptanone會因為氧化劑的添加導致濃度
上升。Heptanal 則是因為臭氧氧化導致
濃度上升，與 Schalekamp(1978)所得到
的 結 果 相 同 。 Linalool 、 Menthol 、
2-Methyl-butanoic acid 及 gamma- 
Cadinene 則是因為氧化劑的添加，而有
氧化去除的現象，導致濃度降低。 
 
4-4 魚腥味及其他臭味物質 
本實驗室於第一年度發現澄清湖藻
粉主要以藻味及草味為主，其中引起腥
味略帶草味的物質為 Heptanal，引起藻
味之物質為 1-octen-3-ol、2,5-octanedione
及 1-hepten-3-ol，而造成草味的物質為
trans,cis,2,4-decadienal 及 beta ionone。 
 
第二年度為了繼續探討魚腥味物
質，針對澄清湖純化的矽藻及鳳山水庫
所 純 化 的 放 線 菌 (Streptomyces 
malaysiensi， Streptmyces caelestis )在實
驗室以 Sensory GC 聞測其味道，並配合
GC/MSD 全圖譜掃描以了解其可能產生
的味道及物質。實驗結果發現該矽藻並
不會產生味道，當然也有可能是分析方
法造成的限制，其產生的臭味物質不適
用 SPME/MSD 分析。 
 
兩種放線菌除了生成土霉味物質
2-MIB 與 geosmin，還會產生其他多種臭
味 物 質 ， 包 括 呈 現 果 臭 味 的
2-Methyl-butanoic acid 與 3-Methyl-

6-Methyl-2-heptanone；造成花香味的
2-Ethyl-1-hexanol 與 Linalool；造成藥草
味 的 Menthol ； 造 成 花 香 味 的
gamma-Cadinene，及果味的 Heptanal、
Heptanol。 
 
同時培養放線菌至第 16 天，並監測
期間臭味物質的變化情形，結果如圖
4-19。由圖 4-19 所示，2-MIB 和 GEM
在第 8 天到第 10 天濃度達最高值；
6-Methyl-2-heptanone 、 Heptanal 及
Heptanol 則是隨著時間逐漸增加，其中
6-Methyl-2-heptanone 在第 13 至第 16 天
時 有 急 遽 增 加 的 現 象 ， 推 測
6-Methyl-2-heptanone 是附著在放線菌細
胞上的一種長鏈化合物，因此在放線菌
呈現衰敗時，可能造成該化合物的剝
離，造成濃度的急速增加。3-Methyl- 
butanoic acid及2-Methyl-butanoic acid則
是在放線菌呈現衰敗時第 13 天後產
生；此與 Rashash 等人 (1996) 指出
3-Methyl-butanoic acid (Isovaleric acid)為
Chlamydomonas peterfii 該藻種的代謝產
物，且可能在衰減期時產生的結果類
似，也顯示這兩種造成酸臭味的物質可
能在產臭之放線菌或是藻類衰敗時產
生。 
 
Heptanal 為國外文獻提及可能造成
黃瓜味或魚腥味之物質，其主要為矽藻
所產生 (Collin et al., 1965; Kikuchi, 
1986)，但也有文獻指出 S. subspicatus 
(綠藻的一種)也會產生此種物質，臭味閾
值為 3μg/L(Cotsaris et al., 1995)，本研
究推測 Heptanal 為藻體內物質，生長時
不會釋放，要等到死亡破裂後才釋放出
來，然而此物質卻是放線菌於代謝過程
釋出之產物。Heptanal 之味道會因濃度
不同而有所改變，因此以其聞測到之味
道判斷，很有可能為引起澄清湖原水冬
天魚腥味之物質。 
 
4-5水中木頭味物質 β-cyclocitral之流佈 
 
(1)金門太湖中β-cyclocitral之流佈情形 
為了了解臭味物質於金門太湖的的
流佈情形，因此研究人員於95年4月間前
往金門太湖，進行短期的不同時間及水
深的採樣，並針對β-cyclocitral濃度、微
囊藻數量進行採樣分析，以及現場水溫
的量測。 
 16
華出現位置與當時的風向具有高度的相
關性，在九十五年四月期間曾經發現金
湖國中岸邊之微囊藻數量高達5×106 
cells/mL，而當時金門的風向為東北東，
因此造成微囊藻大量累積於金湖國中之
岸邊。 
 
由歷次採樣中的表水顯微鏡鏡檢中
發現，太湖表水中之藻相以微囊藻為主
要優勢族群，圖 4-23為金門太湖之
β-cyclocitral與微囊藻數量之間的相關
性，β-cyclocitral與微囊藻數量之間的相
關係數為0.867，代表β-cyclocitral與微囊
藻數量具有高關聯性，顯示太湖中的
β-cyclocitral之主要來源為微囊藻，此結
果與Jones(1995)的研究結果相同，他在
以微囊藻為優勢藻種的Carcoar湖，進行
監測不同時間之β-cyclocitral與微囊藻數
量的變化，並發現β-cyclocitral與微囊藻
數量也同樣具有很好的關聯性。因此大
量微囊藻出現可能會造成水體中產生
β-cyclocitral之臭味，而β-cyclocitral濃度
也能夠反映水體中微囊藻數量。經由圖
4-23中之線性方程式可計算出環境中之
單顆微囊藻細胞產生的β-cyclocitral約為
4.35 fg/cell，而在實驗室中以人工培養的
微囊藻產量為16 fg/cell，推測是由於微
囊藻種類、生存環境不同及其他藻類的
干擾，因此β-cyclocitral的產生量不一致。

(2) 金門太湖中β-cyclocitral與微囊藻毒
的相關性 
    藍綠藻在近十年來被發現能產生藍
綠藻毒素(cyanotoxin)，並且對於許多生
物及人類造成健康上嚴重的影響，因此
藍綠藻華的問題近年來受到高度的重
視，其中藍綠藻中的微囊藻具有產生微
囊藻毒(Microcystins)的能力，並且微囊
藻也是淡水中常造成藻華的主要藻種之
一，蘇氏(2006)曾對於金門太湖的微囊藻
毒與微囊藻數量作相關性之迴歸，並指
出水體中微囊藻毒的濃度與微囊藻數量
具有正相關性。而本研究亦顯示微囊藻
數量與β-cyclocitral濃度具有高度相關
性，將進一步進行β-cyclocitral與微囊藻
毒相關性之研究。 
 
    在一般微囊藻毒素的分析所需要的
時間相當冗長，且步驟繁雜，若能夠以
較簡單快速的方式對於微囊藻的產生及
出現進行監測，將有助於微囊藻毒之預
警。一般常用的方法為以濃縮方法配合
光學顯微鏡對於水中的微囊藻及藍綠細
菌藻數量進行計數，來作為水中藍綠藻
毒素產生的初步判定，但是以人工方式
鏡檢計數藻類數量(cell counting)，常常
會由於人為的誤判、水體中藻類濃度過
低、及濃縮方式不同造成計數上極大的
誤差，因此若能以較簡單、快速及精確
的分析方法，監測藍綠細菌的數量，將
有助於藍綠藻毒素產生的初步判定。 
 
本研究歷次前往金門太湖採樣分析
之微囊藻毒素與β-cyclocitral進行迴歸分
析後發現，總微囊藻毒(total microcystins)
與β-cyclocitral之間的相關性並不佳(圖
4-24)，雖然在金門太湖之總微囊藻毒與
微 囊 藻 細 胞 數 具 正 相 關 性 ， 而
β-cyclocitral也與微囊藻數量也有高度相
關性，但是β-cyclocitral濃度與總微囊藻
毒濃度卻沒有明顯的關聯性。而Kenefick
等人(1992)的研究也指出，雖然水體中
β-cyclocitral的濃度和微囊藻數量具有關
聯 性 ， 但 是 β-cyclocitral 、 2-MIB 與
Geosmin等藍綠細菌藻產生之臭味物
質，都和水體中微囊藻毒LR型沒有明顯
 18
(β-carotene) ，經由胡蘿蔔素加氧脢
(carotene oxygenase)催化而產生(Juttner, 
1985)，β-葫蘿蔔素普遍存在於許多藻類
及高等植物中，而文獻指出，由於微囊
藻體中具有相當高的胡蘿蔔素加氧脢，
因此能夠經由此胡蘿蔔素加氧脢催化
β-carotene與氧(O2)發生氧化反應，而產
生大量β-cyclocitral (Juttner, 1988)。但是
很少有文獻提及其他藻類也會產生
β-cyclocitral，以及產量有多少，因此本
實驗在實驗室中以培養箱分別培養純化
之 微 囊 藻 (Microcystis sp.) 、 顫 藻
(Oscillatoria sp.) 、 球 囊 藻 (Chlorella 
sp.)、以及舟形藻 (Navicula sp.)等四種不
同的藻類，並且分別培養68天、60天、
43天、及30天，在培養的同時，定期從
培養基中採集含藻類之培養基，再以
SPME-GC/MS分析各個藻類培養基中的
β-cyclocitral產量，並且也同時分析藻類
的代謝物，常見的揮發性物質及臭味物
質，如 2-MIB、Geosmin、 β-ionone、
α-ionone、及Heptanal，除了對於臭味物
質的分析外，也以顯微鏡計數藻類的細
胞數以及分析葉綠素a的濃度，以作為藻
類生長情況的依據。至於各純藻培養過
程中，臭味物質的產量將分述於下列各
節。 
 
(1) 微囊藻(標準藻株PCC7820) 
    圖4-26中可看出β-cyclocitral的濃度
在微囊藻培養基中隨著培養天數、微囊
藻細胞數量、以及葉綠素a之濃度而增
加，並且都呈現相當良好的相關性，
β-cyclocitral之濃度與微囊藻細胞數之相
關係數為0.85 (圖4-27)、與葉綠素a.之相
關係數為0.93(圖4-28)，微囊藻細胞數及
葉綠素a可代表微囊藻之生長量，因此顯
示培養基中β-cyclocitral與水中微囊藻生
長量具有正相關性。比較微囊藻(圖4-26)
與顫藻(圖4-30)、小球藻(圖4-31)、舟形
藻(圖4-34)的生長動力曲線可看出，微囊
藻培養基中的β-cyclocitral濃度相對於其
他藻類高出許多數量級，微囊藻在第65
天的培養時，濃度已經高達 380,000 
ng/L(0.38 ppm)，並且由圖4-27中的線性
公式可以計算出單顆微囊藻細胞產生的
β-cyclocitral約為16 fg/cell，由圖4-28之線
性方程式可計算出，微囊藻產生之葉綠
素 a與β-cyclocitral重量比例約為0.056 
mg-β-cyclocitral / mg-chlorophyll a。而在
Rashash (1996)也分析培養的純種銅綠微
囊藻產生的β-cyclocitral量，大約為10.5 
fg/cell，另外Jones(1995)在澳洲的新南威
爾斯州的附近一個產生微囊藻華的湖泊
(Carcoar Dam)，監測此湖泊的微囊藻細
胞數量與β-cyclocitral濃度，並且計算出
單位細胞微囊藻產生的β-cyclocitral為10 
fg/cell，在本實驗中，單顆微囊藻細胞產
生之β-cyclocitral為16 fg/cell，與文獻的
結果類似，但是還是有些許的不同，此
原因可能為微囊藻的種類或生存的環境
不同，使得其揮發性代謝產量會有些微
的改變(Walsh et al., 1998)。 
 
    而雖然微囊藻能夠產生大量的
β-cyclocitral，但是卻無法從培養基中聞
測到任何木頭味的物質，Rashash et 
al.(1996)在以FPA法聞測其培養的微囊
藻也有發現類似的情形，他們指出由於
β-cyclocitral的嗅覺閾值並沒有很低(0.5 
µg/L)，並且在培養基中，其他種類的臭
味物質會對β-cyclocitral產生遮蔽效應，
因 此 沒 有 在 培 養 基 中 直 接 聞 測 到
β-cyclocitral，而本實驗也發現的另外一
個原因，可能是由於β-cyclocitral有98%
是存在於微囊藻細胞中，只有少部分為
溶解態存在於水相中，因此不易揮發至
氣相中而被聞測到。 
 
    其他種類的臭味物質如草味、花香
味物質β-ionone及α-ionone、腥草味物質
heptanal，其中只有β-ionone的產生量會
隨著微囊藻的生長而增加，β-ionone為藻
類常見的揮發性代謝物，Juttner(1984)也
在產生藻華的湖水中發現β-cyclocitral、
β-ionone的存在，微囊藻之正胡蘿蔔素
(nor-carotenoid) 代 謝 物 如 methyl 
heptenone及β-ionone具有能夠抑制其他
細菌及藻類生長的能力(Juttner, 1979)，
 20
4.2×104 cells/mL，都較先前的幾種藻類
為低，圖4-34為舟形藻純藻培養時，其
生長期間β-cyclocitral及其他臭味物質的
濃度變化，由圖中舟形藻在培養的第十
天左右藻細胞數目及葉綠素a.濃度即快
速下降，而β-cyclocitral的濃度變化並沒
有隨著藻細胞濃度變化而增加或衰減，
因此看不出β-cyclocitral與舟形藻的生長
有任何相關性，並且舟形藻培養期間
β-cyclocitral最高濃度約200 ng/L左右，大
部份濃度都在100 ng/L以下，因此可得知
舟形藻在培養過程中產生β-cyclocitral量
較前述的幾種藻要來得低很多。 
 
在矽藻產臭分析的實驗中，發現矽
藻最明顯的臭味物質為Heptanal，文獻中
提到Heptanal為一種腥草味的物質，臭味
閾值約3 µg/L(Cotsaris et al., 1995)，為國
外文獻提及可能為造成黃瓜味與魚腥味
的 物 質 ， Collin 等 人 並 指 出
(1965)Heptanal在水體中之主要來源是
由矽藻所產生，但也有文獻指出
S.subspicatus(綠藻)也會產生此種物質。
何氏(2004)以澄清湖表水培養藻類，並以
顯微鏡觀察，發現培養末期時以矽藻綱
之舟形藻為優勢藻種，但是還沒有產生
明顯氣味，直到形成藻粉之後氣味才釋
放出來，何氏並推測Heptanal為藻體內物
質，生長時不會釋放，要等到死亡破裂
後才釋放出來，並且何氏聞測澄清湖冬
天時的湖水魚腥臭與Heptanal氣味相
似，推測Heptanal是澄清湖造成魚腥臭的
主要物質。由圖4-34可以Heptanal在藻體
及葉綠素a衰減後才快速升高，而本實驗
分析之Heptanal為藻細胞內及溶解態之
總濃度，而Heptanal濃度最高點的時間是
在藻細胞衰減時才出現，因此推論
Heptanal是在舟形藻衰亡時才會產生，並
且Heptanal未必存在於藻體內，Watson
等人(2001)指出，矽藻細胞內皆含有大量
的不飽和脂肪酸 (polyunsaturated fatty 
acids, PUFAs)，矽藻產生之酵素會破壞
不飽和脂肪酸而產生具有味道的不飽和
醛類，如2,4-heptadienal、2,6-nonadienal、
2,4-decadienal及2,4,7-decatrienal等醛類
物質，而由於這些不飽和醛類具有細胞
毒性，因此在藻類生長時不會在細胞內
大量產生(Rashash et al., 1996)，只有在藻
華結束時，細胞因為衰老而破裂，才會
大量產生具有臭味之不飽和醛類
(Watson et al., 1996)，而Heptanal也是屬
於不飽和醛類的一種，因此推測矽藻中
之Heptanal來源與上述之不飽和醛類類
似，都是由於矽藻衰亡而產生。 
 
綜合上述，可發現微囊藻單位細胞
可產生較高的β-cyclocitral量，約16.10 
fg/cell，而矽藻單位細胞中也能產生相當
高的β-cyclocitral量，約13.66 fg/cell，並
且舟形藻的各種臭味物質產生量與其他
藻類相比也有較高的情形，推測是由於
舟形藻之細胞體積較大所導致，因此單
位細胞之舟形藻也能產生相當大量的
β-cyclocitral，並且與微囊藻相當。但是
在自然水體中，微囊藻藻華發生時，每
毫升的水體中可高達數十萬甚至數億個
細胞微囊藻細胞，推算此時水體中之
β-cyclocitral可能在1000 ng/L ~數個mg/L
的濃度範圍，但是舟形藻由於體積較
大，因此其在水體中大量出現時，數量
通常也在每毫升兩萬個細胞以下，推算
其產生的β-cyclocitral濃度約200 ng/L，因
此推測當水中大量出現顫藻、球囊藻、
及舟形藻時，水體中並無法產生高濃度
的β-cyclocitral，但是當微囊藻大量出現
時，水體中β-cyclocitral濃度會顯著地偏
高。 
 
五、結論 
本研究為三年之研究計畫，已純化
出的產 2-MIB 藻種判定為 Planktothrix，
另有三株產 2-MIB 及或 geosmin 的鏈黴
菌。目前已了解環境因子如溫度、照度
及營養鹽、放線菌得碳源及其孢子生成
對此純化顫藻及鏈黴菌生長與代謝臭味
物質之影響，併吞估其單位質量臭物質
產量，以及氧化劑對其細胞與胞內臭味
物質釋出之影響。 
 22
氧化實驗結果顯示，pH 為 6 時，在
放線菌存在的情況下，以臭氧劑量
1.5~2.0mg/L-min 進行氧化，土霉味物質
的去除率約為 6%~15%，其主要反應是
由臭氧分子直接進行氧化；pH 為 8 時，
土霉味物質的去除率提高至約 30%。次
氯酸鈉及高錳酸鉀濃度 5mg/L，進行氧
化 1 小時，土霉味物質的去除率也只有
20%~30%。 
 
以臭氧氧化鏈黴菌存在之水樣，可
能 會 導 致 Heptanal 、 Heptanol 與
6-Methyl-2-heptanone 的 增 加 。 其 中
6-Methyl-2-heptanone 會因為氧化劑的添
加 ， 而 使 得 濃 度 上 升 。 Linalool 、
Menthol 、 2-Methyl-butanoic acid 及
gamma-Cadinene 則是因為氧化劑的添
加，而有氧化去除的現象，導致濃度降
低。 
 
5. 水中的 β-cyclocitral 流佈 
以感覺分析方法 FPA 及 Sensory 
GC 配合儀器方分析GC/MS分析金門太
湖微囊藻華發現，微囊藻華中具有許多
種類之臭味物質，包括未知來源的腐敗
酸臭味、6-Methyl-5-Hepten-2-ol、香草味, 
2-Nonenal 、 土 霉 味 , 2-MIB 、 腥 味
2,4-Decadienal、土霉味 Geosmin、及木
頭味 β-cyclocitral，其中 β-cyclocitral 為
微囊藻藻華中最主要的揮發性有機物。 
 
在實驗室純化培養的各種藻類中發
現 ， 不 同 的 藻 類 都 會 產 生  
β-cyclocitral，但是只有微囊藻具有產生
大量 β-cyclocitral 的能力。  即使是其他
藻類細胞濃度相當高時，依然無法產生
高濃度的 β-cyclocitral。 
 
經由多個水庫的長期及短期監測中
發現，當水體中 β-cyclocitral 的濃度很低
時，水中微囊藻細胞濃度一定不高，甚
至沒有微囊藻，而水中的 β-Cyclocitral
主要是由其他藻類所產生，但是當水體
中之 β-cyclocitral 濃度偏高時，可能是微
囊藻數量較多所造成，因此很可能水中
已有較高濃度的微囊藻存在。

Materials and methods
Isolation of actinomycetes
The samples used to isolate actinomycetes were collected from the mud of the Feng-Seng
reservoir. The isolated pure cultures were cultivated on starch–casein agar (Standard
Methods, 1995) with 50mg/ml cycloheximide to inhibit growth of fungi and inoculated
under 30 8C.
Morphology and cultural characteristics
The spore-chain morphology of puriﬁed actinomycete strains were examined by optical
microscopy and electron microscopy (SEM) after 5–7 days growth. Spore surface was
observed from SEM microphotographs using glutaraldehyde as ﬁxing reagent and ethanol
as dehydrating reagent.
Detection of geosmin and MIB production
The cultured actinomycetes formed spores at about 3–5 days of growth. At that time, a
sample of approximately 16 cm2 of agar was taken from each of the pure culture plates,
and was placed in a 100ml glass vial containing 50ml distilled water and a PTFE coated
stir bar. IPMP (2-isopropyl-3-methoxy pyrazine) was added at 10 ng/L into the vial as an
internal standard. In addition, 13.5 g of sodium chloride was also added to improve the
partitioning of taste and odor compounds to headspace during extraction.
Samples were analyzed using a computer coupled with a gas chromatograph (GC) and
a mass spectrometer (MS). GC-MS analysis was performed after 2min desorption in
splitless mode at 250 8C. Samples were run in selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode, and
MIB and geosmin were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed using retention time. The procedure for
the analysis of 2-MIB and geosmin was the same as prescribed by the standard method
NIEA W537.50B of Taiwan EPA.
DAN extraction and PCR ampliﬁcation
Total DNA samples of the three puriﬁed strains were prepared according to the method
modiﬁed from Miller et al. (1999). The base sequences for the DNA fragments were
decided by a commercial laboratory (Mission Biotech, Taipei, Taiwan).
Phylogenetic analyses
DNA sequence was aligned with BioEdit. The aligned sequence was compared with
those of the reference bacterium available in the GenBank database by BLAST search at
NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) website.
Culture conditions of broth
The inoculum was prepared from the combined spores and vegetative hyphae of a station-
ary-phase culture grown on agar plates. The cells harvested from one plate were trans-
ferred into a 15ml ﬂask with 3ml M medium (Aoyama et al., 1985) and incubated for
5–7 days at 30 8C. The M medium was modiﬁed for the purpose of increasing the pro-
duction of earthy-musty odors (Aoyama, 1990). Then, the actinomycetes-laden solution
was transferred into a 100ml bioreactor with addition of another 50ml of M-medium.
The incubated broth was used to evaluate the condition of growth and odor-compound
production at different temperatures of 20, 25 and 30 8C with aeration. Analysis of geos-
min and 2-MIB were performed at 7 days of incubation. To account for the dissolved and
intracellular odorants in the samples, a 0.7mm glass ﬁber ﬁlter (Whatman, GF/F,
England) was used to obtain ﬁltrate and non-ﬁltered samples. Differentiation between sol-
uble odor compounds and odor compounds in the actinomycete cells was determined by

2002) showed that many streptomycete species might produce geosmin and 2-MIB, to
our knowledge, no previous studies have proved that the three stains are 2-MIB and/or
geosmin producers.
Effect of temperature on streptomyce growth and odor production
The biomass as well as odorant production of the two streptomycetes tested is illustrated
in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2a displays the biomass growth and MIB and geosmin
production of S. malaysiensis at 7 days under 20, 25 and 30 8C. In addition, Figure 2b
shows the odorant production expressed in unit biomass basis, including geosmin and
MIB/biomass (G/B or M/B, both in ng/mg dry weight), and the ratio of dissolved
(or extra-cellular) geosmin or MIB to total concentrations of both.
Temperature did not have a strong effect on the production of the total biomass for
S. malaysiensis. However, temperature does inﬂuence the production of geosmin and
2-MIB. The maximal overall geosmin (1,900 ng/L) and MIB (1,000 ng/L) production
were at 30 8C. In a unit mass basis, the maximal G/B (4.5 ng/mg) and M/B (2.4 ng/mg)
were also at 30 8C. The distribution of geosmin and 2-MIB within the cell or in the aqu-
eous phase may also be found in Figure 2b. As temperature increased, more 2-MIB and
geosmin were present within the cells.
The production of cell biomass as well as MIB for S. caelestis is shown in Figure 3.
Unlike that for S. malaysiensis, more biomass and total MIB was produced at higher tem-
perature. The unit mass based MIB production was also larger at higher temperature.
However, the distribution of MIB within the cells or in the dissolved phase did not
change much at different temperatures. This is somewhat different to that for
S. malaysiensis, for which more odorants remained in the cells at higher temperature.
Blevins et al. (1995) studied the production of geosmin from S. halstedii, which was
isolated from an aquaculture pond. They found that the optimal temperature for the
species to grow is 30 8C. Besides, they reported both the maximal geosmin production
(161.6 ng/ml) and maximal G/B ratio (75.6 ng/mg dry weight) occurred at 35 8C. Dionigi
and Ingram (1994) studied cultures of Streptomyces tendae isolated from soil. They
reported that the species incubated at 30 and 40 8C produced more biomass and more
geosmin than those incubated at 10 and 20 8C. Also, they showed that the species could
still produce geosmin at temperatures as high as 45 8C. Our results about the higher mass
and odorant production at higher temperature for S. malaysiensis and S. caelestis are
similar to that reported by Blevins et al. (1995) and Dionigi and Ingram (1994) for differ-
ent streptomycete species.
Unlike temperature effect on odorant production, much few researchers paid attention
to the extracellular and intracellular geosmin and/or MIB ratios. This may be of import-
ance in water treatment processes involving particle removal and odorant release due to
chemical addition, for examples coagulation and chlorination. Our study showed that the
ratios of extracellular to total concentrations of geosmin and MIB were between 40% and

they found sporulating cultures contained more geosmin than nonsporulating cultures of
S. tendae. Schrader and Blevins (2001) investigated the effects of carbon sources on bio-
mass yields and G/B ratios for S. halstedii. They found that glucose may suppress the
production of geosmin. Since glucose is the hydrolyzed product of starch, in our study,
the use of starch may also suppress the production of geosmin and/or MIB.
Conclusions
Three actinomycete strains were isolated from Feng-Shen reservoir and were cultured.
Based on 16S rDNA sequencing and GenBank comparison, the three strains were ident-
iﬁed as Streptomyces caelestis, S. roseoﬂavus and S. malaysiensis. S. malaysiensis is a
producer of both geosmin and MIB, S. roseoﬂavus produces geosmin, and S. caelestis
produces MIB. This study also showed that the best temperature tested was 30 8C for
S. malaysiensis and S. caelestis to produce geosmin and/or MIB. For most cases, the
majority of MIB and/or geosmin were in the dissolved phase for both S. malaysiensis and

Abstract Cyanobacteria are present in many drinking water reservoirs in the world, and some of them may
produce microcystins, anatoxin-a and other natural toxins: In this study, two groups of algal toxins:
microcystins and anatoxin-a, and associated toxin producers were investigated. Water samples from nine
major drinking water reservoirs and seven associated water puriﬁcation plants were collected. An HPLC and
an LC/MS were employed to detect the concentrations of ﬁve microcystins (microcystins-LR, RR, YR, LW,
LF) and anatoxin-a. Molecular biotechnology methods were used to sequence Microcystis sp. gene from the
cyanobacteria bloom from two of the reservoirs. Monitoring results suggested that microcystins were
present in all the drinking water reservoirs studied, and some of them had concentration higher than the
WHO guideline of microcystins-LR (1mg/L). Unlike microcystins, anatoxin-a was only found in four
reservoirs, mostly in King-Men island. After comparing the DNA sequence with existing cyanobacteria
reference database, Microcystis aeruginosa and other Microcystis sp. were conﬁrmed present in the two
reservoirs tested.

Introduction
The presence of toxic cyanobacteria in drinking water sources as well as recreational
waters has received increasing worldwide attention. This toxic cyanobacteria problem
commonly occurs in the eutrophic reservoirs and lakes. According to the monitoring
results of 1998 to 2002 from Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TWEPA,
2003), more than half of Taiwan’s 20 major reservoirs were characterized as eutrophic
based on the Trophic Carlson State Index. Besides eutrophic conditions, because of
Taiwan’s tropical weather, cyanobacteria bloom is easy to ﬁnd in many drinking water
reservoirs in Taiwan. Although cyanobacterial toxins are known to cause acute and
chronic toxicity to animals and human, and are expected to be present in the reservoir
water, no previous study has focused on a nationwide investigation of the presence of
toxins for Taiwan’s drinking water sources.
Among the many different cyanobacterial toxins, microcystins are the most abundant
in many surface water sources. The major health effect for humans for the toxin is hepa-
tic injury. More than 80 types of microcystin groups have been observed around the
world (Barco et al., 2002). Besides microcystins, another group of neural toxins, anatox-
ins are also of concern. In this study, two groups of algal toxins: microcystins and ana-
toxin-a, and associated toxin producers were investigated on a nationwide basis. Water
samples from nine major drinking water reservoirs and seven associated water puriﬁ-
cation plants were collected. The data were analyzed for understanding the distribution of
algal toxins in the source water, as well as the removal efﬁciency in the water puriﬁcation
plants. To identify the potential microcystin producers, molecular biotechnology was also

microcystin-LF ([M þ H]þ, m/z = 986.2) and anatoxin-a ([M þ H-O]þ, m/z = 158.6)
were measured in the mass range of m/z = 100–1300 in positive mode. For all the
analyses, the oven temperature (Model CTO-10Avp, Shimadzu, Japan) was maintained
at 40 8C.
Strain isolation and culture conditions
The cultures isolated in this study were obtained by picking a single colony from water
samples under microscope observation. The isolated cultures were incubated in fresh-
water medium of BG-11 or BS, either 5ml in 30ml tubes or 30ml in 100ml ﬂasks. The
temperature was controlled at 20 8C and at a light intensity of approximately 1500 lux for
a cycle with a light-to-dark ratio of 16 hour to 8 hour.
DNA isolation, PCR ampliﬁcation, DGGE screening and sequencing
Identiﬁcation of microcystin producers followed the procedures of DNA extraction, poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcation, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE) screening, DNA sequencing, and comparison with DNA database. At ﬁrst, total
genomic DNA was extracted from lyophilized cultures or frozen ﬁeld samples using the
Chemagic Bac 100 kit (Chemagen, Germany). The extracted DNA samples were used for
PCR ampliﬁcation. Two primers, mcyA (MSF , MSR) (Tillett et al., 2001) and mcyB
(2156F , 3111R) (Mikalsen et al., 2003), were used in amplifying the target DNA frag-
ments. A modiﬁed mcyB (135F , 676R) was employed to increase the GC-clamp for
DGGE. Then, the DNA fragments from DGGE results were selected for sequencing.
Finally, DNA sequences were aligned using BioEdit software and identiﬁed using nucleo-
tide-nucleotide BLAST at the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information)
homepage.
Results and discussion
Toxin concentrations in source waters
The concentrations of both microcystins and anatoxin-a in the nine source waters (reser-
voirs) are summarized in Table 1. A total concentration range of 37–3200 ng/L of the
ﬁve microcystins was found for the source waters tested. For the ﬁve microcystins moni-
tored, the LR, RR and LF forms were found in all the source waters tested. The types of
microcystins seem to be different in different geographical locations. In Fei-Tsui Reser-
voir of north Taiwan, the major microcystin forms were LR and RR. For other reservoirs,
the major microcystin types were LR, YR and LW for central Taiwan, and were LR, RR,
and LF for south Taiwan. Besides microcystins, anatoxin-a was also detected in four of
the source waters, mostly for the reservoirs in KingMen island.
The total concentrations of the ﬁve microcystins are listed in Table 1 for comparison.
While most other reservoirs/lakes are eutrophic, Tseng-Wen reservoir is the only one
among the reservoirs monitored that is normally categorized as mesotrophic. It is reason-
able to ﬁnd that Tseng-Wen Reservoir has the lowest microcystin concentration compared
to other source waters. For the reservoir in KingMen island (a subsidiary island near
FuJen Province of Mainland China), the concentrations of both microcystins and ana-
toxin-a were much higher than those in Taiwan. All the three lakes/reservoirs were attrib-
uted to seriously eutrophic condition, and therefore, the toxin concentrations were very
high.
Microcystins removals in the water puriﬁcation plants

cation plants (WPPs) sampled. There are three types of treatment processes in the seven

WPPs monitored. Three WPPs possess conventional processes of pre-chlorination, coagu-
lation, sedimentation, ﬁltration, and post-chlorination, designated as conventional
A. Another group of three WPPs, all in KingMen island, added a slow sand ﬁlter into the
conventional processes, designated as conventional B. Cheng-Ching Lake WPP is an
advanced water treatment plant, with ozonation, pellet softening, and granular activated
carbon adsorption in addition to the conventional processes.
An average removal efﬁciency of 46–76% was observed for the WPPs with conven-
tional treatment process A, while a removal efﬁciency of 57–88% was found for the con-
ventional B process. The removal efﬁciency for the conventional B process compared to
the conventional A process may be attributed to the presence of biological effects. Slow
sand ﬁlters are known to be an excellent place for microbes to grow. As microcystins are
considered biodegradable (Ishii et al., 2004), the presence of slow sand ﬁlter may contrib-
ute some biological side of removal. For the advanced treatment plant, the removal efﬁ-
ciency is as high as 95.6%. This suggests that ozone/GAC process is an appropriate
process for removing microcystins.
Identiﬁcation of microcystin producers
To identify the microcystin producers in the source waters, cyanobacteria-laden water
samples from Tseng-Wen Reservoir and Mu-Tan Reservoir were analyzed using molecu-
lar biotechnology. Two functional genes of microcystin producers (mcyA and mcyB),
were selected for the analysis. Two oligonucleotide primers, MSF and MSR, were used
in amplifying the (NMT) domain for mcyA region. A 1300 base pairs (bp) of PCR
product may be obtained through the use of these primers. Two primers for mcyB at
135F to 676R and 2156F to 3111R were used to amplify the adenylation domain.
According to the report of Mikalsen et al. (2003), mcyA and mcyB genes both produce
speciﬁc amino acids for the synthesis of microcystins. If there is a response of PCR to
these two genes in the extracted DNA samples, the presence of microcystin producers
may be conﬁrmed. The samples from both Tseng-Wen Reservoir and Mu-Tan Reservoir
have a PCR response of both mcyA and mcyB. This indicates the presence of microcystin
producers in the two reservoirs. In addition, we also modiﬁed the mcyB primer
(135F , 676R) to increase a GC-clamp in 30 side of 135F. After cloning, we used the
GC-135F , 676R primer to run DGGE and to select the suitable samples for sequen-
cing. The sequencing results are listed in Table 3. After comparing with the BLAST on
the NCBI homepage, 98–99% of similarity was found for both samples, suggesting that
the samples contain microcystis aeruginosa. In fact, we have also isolated Microcystis sp.
from the two reservoirs. Through optical observation, the isolated cultures are very much

2odour compounds, such as geosmin, E-ionone, and E-cyclocitral have been linked to the presence of 
Microcystis and Anabaena (Jones and Korth, 1995).  These compounds may be used as biomarkers 
for the presence of potentially of toxic cyanobacteria species.  In addition, the two most commonly 
observed musty/earthy odor compounds, geosmin and 2-MIB, have also been linked to the presence 
of microcystins (Carmichael, 2001). Therefore, there is a potential to link the relationship among 
cyanobacterial toxins, some off-flavour compounds, and environmental parameters.  In this study, 
the two major groups of cyanobacterial metabolites, microcystins and 2-MIB, and 22 other water 
quality and meteorological parameters were collected for two source waters (Moo-Tan and 
Tseng-Wen reservoirs) in south Taiwan for near two years.  These parameters were then analyzed for 
their correlations.    The results of this study may help predict the presence of cyanotoxins and 
off-flavour compounds in the source waters. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Site Description 
Both Tseng-Wen Reservoir (TWR) and Moo-Tan Reservoir (MTR) are located in south Taiwan, and 
are important source waters in south Taiwan.  TWR is the largest reservoir in Taiwan, with a storage 
capacity of 7.0u109 m3 and an area of 1.7u106 m2.   For MTR, the storage capacity and area are 
3.1u107 m3 and 1.4u106 m2, respectively.  The mean residence time of the water is about 3 years for 
TWR, and about 0.25 year for MTR.   
The reservoirs were monitored for major water quality parameters seasonally by Taiwan 
Environmental Protection Administration (TWEPA).  Based on the monitoring data of TWEPA 
(2005), the average (and standard deviation) of the major water quality measured at 0.5-1 m below 
water surface for MTR between 2000 and 2004 are 20.6 (r8.4) Pg/L for total phosphorus (TP), 3.4 
(r4.8) 17U for turbidity, 1.9 (r0.6) for Secchi Disk depth (transparency; SD), and 7.5 (r6.0) Pg/L 
for chlorophyll-a (chla).  Those for TWR are 30.9 (r37.5) Pg/L TP, 4.5 (r5.9) 17U, 1.9 (r0.8) SD, 
and 4.8 (r3.2) Pg/L chla.  Based on the monitored data of TP, transparency, and chla, the average 
Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI) may be calculated.  The CTSI, from 2000 to 2004, is between 45 
and 50 for TWR, and is between 45 and 52 for MTR.  Since the ceiling value for eutrophication is 
CTSI = 50, both reservoirs may be categorized as slightly eutrophic.  The sampling locations for both 
reservoirs were near the water surface (0.5 m below the surface) above their water intakes.   The 
water samples were collected about once a month from August 2003 to April 2005, normally between 
10 - 11 am.  Amber glass bottles of 0.25 L were used for the collection of water samples for 2-MIB 
and geosmin, and 2-L of plastic bottle was used for microcystins.  All the samples were collected 
without headspace and were kept at 4 qC before analysis.  The samples were pre-treated using 
ultrasound and followed by solid phase extraction within 48 hours for toxin determination, and were 
analyzed for 2-MIB and geosmin mostly within 1-3 days and in 7 days for only in a few cases. 
Chemicals
Standards of microcystin-LR were purchased from Supelco (analytical grade, USA) and other 
microcystins (YR, RR, LF, and LW) from End Biosciences (analytical grade, USA).  The analytical 
standard for 2-MIB was purchased from Sigma (analytical grade, Germany) at a concentration of 2 
mg/L, while that for geosmin was obtained from Wako (analytical grade, Japan) at 0.1 mg/L.  To 
prepare calibration standards, the toxins were dissolved into methanol, and then diluted with the 
reagent water from a Mili-Q water purification system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, US) to 
pre-determined concentrations.  For 2-MIB calibration standards, Mili-Q water was used to dilute the 
analytical standards to pre-determined concentrations. 
4RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Long-term monitoring results 
The concentration changes of the two groups of cyanobacterial metabolites, along with water 
temperature at the sampling time, are illustrated in Figure 1.  The total microcystin concentration (LR, 
YR, RR, LF, and LW) was between 10 and 250 ng/L for MTR, and between 10 and 340 ng/L for 
TWR.  For 2-MIB, concentrations of 2 - 30 ng/L were observed for TWR, while much lower 
concentrations, often below 5 ng/L, were measured in Moo-Tan Reservoir.  Another earthy odourant, 
geosmin, was mostly below detection limit (about 0.5 ng/L) in these two reservoirs.  As shown in the 
figure, the concentration of both 2-MIB and microcystins followed the trend that higher 
concentrations were present in warmer seasons for both reservoirs.  This may reflect that temperature 
may be an important factor governing the production of these two metabolites. 
Figure 1. The concentration changes of total microcystins and 2-MIB in (a) Tseng-Wen, and (b) 
Moo-Tan Reservoir 
To examine the relationships among the microcystins, 2-MIB, geosmin, and other water quality and 
meteorological parameters collected, a stepwise regression technique was employed 
(Garcia-Villavova et. al., 1997).  In this analysis, microcystins and 2-MIB concentrations were 
assumed to be dependent variable, and other parameters were assumed to be independent variables.  
To perform the regression, both the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and t test were employed using 
the Statistical Products and Service Solution (SPSS) software (Chicago, IL, US).  Note that air 
temperature was not included in the analysis, as it is highly correlated with water temperature (see 
next section).  The regression coefficients (R
2
) for the regression models selected are listed in Table 1.  
Most of the parameters were not selected into the regression models, except water temperature, 
conductivity, pH, sulfate, DO, nitrate, TOC, and transparency.  In fact, as shown in the table, water 
temperature is considered as the most important variable relevant to the presence of microcystins and 
2-MIB concentrations in TWR and to the presence of microcystins concentrations in MTR.  In 
addition, 2-MIB was found to the second important factor linked to the microcystins concentrations 
in TWR.  Although the Cyanobacteria that produce microcystins and 2-MIB may not be the same, the 
production of these two groups of compounds may both increased with higher temperatures in 
Tseng-Wen Reservoir.  Although 2-MIB concentration in MTR was correlated to a few factors, 
including nitrate, TP, turbidity, and pH, the 2-MIB concentration was mostly very low (often < 5 
ng/L).   It is difficult to further analyze the 2-MIB data for MTR.  Therefore, 2-MIB data were only 
analyzed for TWR, and microcystins data were analyzed for both reservoirs.

simple correlations for microcystins and 2-MIB for TWR.  In each of the correlations, only one or

Correlation among 2-MIB, microcystins, and mean air temperature
The concentration of cyanobacterial metabolites may be considered to reflect of the growth history of 
cyanobacteria.  Therefore, a change of environmental condition may cause the change of metabolite 
concentrations.  As water temperature and air temperature may have good correlation with 
cyanobacterial metabolites concentrations, an analysis of temperature history with the concentration 
of microcystins was conducted.  In the analysis, the data of mean daily (air) temperature from 1 to 20 
days before the sampling time were selected to represent the temperature history in the reservoirs.  
For the correlation with cyanobacterial metabolites, the average of one to 20 days of mean daily 
temperature in the data was used.  
Figure 3 illustrates the regression coefficient (R
2
) of the correlation between different average 
mean daily temperatures with microcystins in TWR and MTR.  In the figure, the first day (horizontal 
or X axis) and the last day (vertical or Y axis) represent the time span of mean daily temperature used 
in the analysis.  For example, for the case of X = 5 days and Y = 10 days, it represents an average of 
6 days of mean daily temperature, from 5 to 10 days before sampling.  The numbers shown in the 
contours are the R
2
 values.
As illustrated in Figure 3(a) for TWR, the regression coefficient (R
2
) for the case of microcystins 
was found to be highest in the upper left corner of the plot, implying that the starting time should be

predicted by  periods of 18 and 14 days, respectively, likely reflecting the differences in size and 
residence time of the two systems. These correlations may have a potential to be used to roughly 
estimate the two groups of cyanobacterial metabolites in the two source waters.

Abstract In this study, three 2-MIB and/or geomsin producers were isolated to determine their 17
odourant production, and to investigate the release and destruction of the odourants under 18
oxidation processes.  The odourant producers, including a cyanobacterium (Planktothrix sp.) and19
two actinomycetes (Streptomyces spp.), were isolated from two water sources in southern Taiwan, 20
and then identified using molecular biotechnology. Both the purified Planktothrix and 21
Streptomyces were incubated at 20, 25 and 30qC to determine 2-MIB and geosmin production 22
ratios.  At 20 and 25qC, a substantial proportion (around 80%) of 2-MIB remained in the cells of 23
Planktothrix during the logarithmic growth phase.  The intracellular 2-MIB was released into the 24
water once this cyanobacterium reached its stationary growth phase.  For Streptomyces, about 50%25
of either geosmin or 2-MIB were present within cells during the logarithmic growth phase.  26
Oxidation of the cyanobacterium laden water was also conducted with addition of chlorine, 27
permanganate, and ozone. All the three oxidants were able to break the cell membrane of 28
Planktothrix  sp. and caused the release of almost all the 2-MIB from cells into water.  29

INTRODUCTION35
All year round, a musty odour is present in the source water of Feng-Shen Waterworks (FSW), 36
Taiwan.  A 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) concentration between 10 ng/L and 200 ng/L was normally 37
detected in the source water (Lin et. al., 2002).  Although the populations of phytoplankton and 38
actinomycetes have been positively related to the strength of musty odour in the area, the responsible 39
microorganism for the musty odour remains unknown.  In this study, a 2-MIB producer was isolated 40
from one of the source waters of FSW (Kao-Ping River) and was identified as Planktothrix  sp.  In 41
addition, two actinomycetes, Streptomyces caelestis (confirmed in our laboratory as a 2-MIB 42
producer) and Streptomyces malaysiensis (confirmed as a 2-MIB and geosmin producer) were 43
isolated from the mud near the pump station of FSW. The two Streptomyces spp. were identified by 44
comparing their DNA sequence with those of the reference bacterium available in the GenBank 45
database by BLAST search (Altschul et. al., 1990).46
47
To gain a clear understanding for the treatment options for FSW, the physiology of the 48
odorant-producing organisms and their response during the treatment processes need to be known. 49
Oxidation processes, particularly using the three common oxidants, chlorine, potassium 50
permanganate, and ozone in a water utility, have been demonstrated to eliminate the musty odour to 51

Germany) was used for the production of ozone in the study. The ozone dose was set at 1mg/L-min.  1
For the oxidation experiments of chlorine and potassium permanganate, 200 mL batch reactors were 2
used. The reactors were filled with cyanobacteria-laden medium with no headspace in the system, and 3
the medium was stirred continuously with a Telfon-coated magnetic stirrer under the rotation rate 4
below 100 rpm. Without the addition of oxidants, no cell damage was observed under optical 5
microscope in the experimental condition. The experiments were also controlled at 25r1qC, and the 6
contact time was set at 60 minutes.  Three initial dosages of chlorine and permanganate were used, 7
including 1 mg/L, 2 mg/L, and 5 mg/L.  The concentration of 2-MIB and chlorophyll a were 8
monitored before and after oxidation. In the experiment, chlorophyll a was used to characterized the 9
biomass of Planktothrix. The dissolved potassium ion was used for the evaluation of cell structure 10
integrity, which was analyzed with ICP-MS (Hewlett Packard 4500, Japan). 11
12
Gas-phase ozone concentrations were determined by Ozone Demand/Requirement: Semi-Batch 13
Method, which was reported in Standard Method (2350 E, APHA et al., 1998).  A water quality 14
analyzer (Merck, Nova 60, USA) was used to determine the concentration of residual chlorine. The 15
Spectrophotometer Method (4500-KMnO4) prescribed in the Standard Methods (APHA et al., 1998) 16
was used for permanganate concentration. 17

Analysis of 2-MIB and geosmin 19
20
The concentrations of 2-MIB and geosmin were analyzed using headspace solid-phase 21
microextraction (HSPME) coupled with a gas chromatograph (GC, HP-6890) and a mass 22
spectrometer detector (MSD, HP-5973). The procedure for the analysis of 2-MIB and geosmin was 23
the same as prescribed by Standard Method 6040D (APHA et. al., 2000).  The internal standard, 24
2-isobutyl-3-methoxy pyrazine (IBMP) was used together with SIM (selected ion mode) in the MS 25
for the quantification of the odorants.  Quality control (QC) samples were also prepared and analyzed.  26
The QC results show that duplicates (< 15 %), laboratory control standards (80-120 %), and 27
laboratory fortified matrix standards (80-120 %) were all within reasonable ranges. 28

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION32
33
Effect of temperature on the growth and odour production Planktothrix sp. and Streptomyces34
spp.35
The concentrations of 2-MIB and chlorophyll a in the incubated samples for Planktothrix  at different 36
temperatures are shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1(a), at 20 and 25°C, a substantial proportion 37
of 2-MIB (at about 80%) remained in the cell for the cyanobacterium after cultivating 7 days.  At 38
30°C, less than 50% of 2-MIB remained within the cells after 7 days, implying that cells may have 39
reached a later growth phase earlier in this highest temperature regime, also suggested by the 40
near-constant ratio of 2-MIB to chlorophyll a (in ng-2-MIB/Pg-chlorophyll a), which was 41
independent of temperature. The yields of 2-MIB and chlorophyll a were related positively to 42
temperature.   43
44
The observations of Ploeg et. al. (1995) and Hu (1998) were similar to the results of this study. 45
Ploeg et. al. (1995) reported the 2-MIB to protein ratio of Oscillatoria CF. chalybea at 21.5°C and 46
24°C was similar or slightly lower than that at 28°C.  Hu (1998) discovered that the growth of47
Anabaena sp. increased with increasing temperature in the range of 15-35°C.48

always much lower than MIB in source water of FSW.  Besides, Streptmycete species may only 1
produce significant amount of MIB and/or geosmin as spores forming under the condition of no 2
mixing and aeration.  In fact, an aeration system is present in FS Reservoir, which is not an 3
appropriate condition for S. sp. to produce MIB and geosmin 4

Effects of ozone, chlorine and permanganate oxidation on Planktothrix sp.23
Three water quality parameters were monitored in the oxidation experiments of Planktothrix 24
sp.-laden water, including chlorophyll a, dissolved potassium, and 2-MIB.  In this study, interaction 25
of cyanobacterium cells with the three oxidants was evaluated using optical microscope, and analysis 26
of dissolved potassium. The monitoring of potassium followed the study of Peterson et. al. (1995), in 27
which potassium was used as an indicator of cell damage for Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. In these 28
oxidation experiments, 2-MIB concentrations were 21.0-23.0 µg/L initially.  The initial dosages of 29
sodium hypochlorite were 1, 2 and 5 mg/L (expressed in Cl2), and the corresponding residual chlorine 30
after 60 minutes of oxidation was at 0.18, 0.36 and 2.38 mg/L, respectively.  For permanganate, the 31
initial dosages were 1, 2, and 5 mg/L (in MnO4
-
), and the residual permanganate concentration was 32
0.58, 0.77 and 2.44 mg/L, respectively, after 60 minutes of oxidation.  33
34
Figure 3 illustrates the change of odourant concentrations during the oxidation of the 35
cyanobacteria-laden water. For the ozonation, the removal efficiency of total 2-MIB achieved 50% 36
within 3 minutes.  In the meantime, the ratio of dissolved 2-MIB to total 2-MIB increased sharply 37
from 3% to 70%. The sudden increase of potassium concentration might reflect damage of the cells. 38
However, the release of intracellular 2-MIB was slower, and was released completely after 5 minutes.  39
The experimental results for the oxidation of the samples by chlorine and permanganate after 60 40
minutes are shown in Figure 3(b). Under normal treatment concentrations, permanganate did not 41
induce significant release of cellular 2-MIB. However, at a higher dosage, permanganate could cause 42
the release of 2-MIB. The results were similar to that of Tung et. al. (2004), in which the dissolved 43
2-MIB concentration increased by 60% and 15% under 2 mg/L dosage and 60 minute exposure of 44
chlorine and permanganate, respectively. It was also found that the removal efficiencies of total 45
2-MIB were less than 10% for both oxidants. This is similar to the result of Lalezary et. al. (1982) and 46
Glaze et. al. (1990). Although, all three oxidants may break the cell membrane and cause the release 47

CONCLUSIONS10
In this study, three 2-MIB and geomsin producers, a cyanobacterium and two actinomycetes, were 11
isolated from two source waters in southern Taiwan. The cyanobacterium, a 2-MIB producer, was 12
identified as Planktothrix sp.  The two 2-MIB and/or geosmin producing actinomytecetes were 13
identified as Streptomyces caelestis and Streptomyces malaysiensis. The unit mass chlorophyll a14
based 2-MIB production of Planktothrix sp. was around 250-300 ng-2-MIB/µg-chlorophyll-a15
between 20 and 30°C, and the production ratios for 2-MIB and geosmin of S. malaysiensis, and S.16
caelestis were about 1-5 ng/mg-dry weight. Addition of chlorine, permanganate, and ozone may 17
cause the damage of cell membrane of Planktothrix sp. and the release of almost all the 2-MIB from 18
cells into water, but only ozone could effectively destroy dissolved MIB to a degree of higher than 19
50%.20

Abstract:  Two intensive water sampling were conducted in Tai-Lake Reservoir (TLR) and 
Waterworks (TLW), Kin-Men Island for the determination of cyanobacteria, microcystis sp.,
chlorophyll-a, microcystins, and 2-MIB concentrations in the reservoir and their removal in 
the waterworks.  The samples for the reservoir water were collected at/near the water intake, 
and one of them was sampled at 4 different depths.  Most of the parameters measured varied 
significant at different depths and different time, and only 2-MIB concentration remained 
almost constant through out the 24 hour period and at different depths.  This may imply that 
2-MIB was likely to uniformly distribute in the reservoir water.  For most of the 
cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial metabolites measured, no strong correlations were observed.
However, a good correlation between microcystis sp. and microcystins concentrations was 
found, indicating that the probable relationship between the toxins and their producers.  This 
simple correlation may also be used in the estimation of the cell-bound and dissolved 
concentration of microcystins in the reservoir water.  For the samples collected for the 
waterworks, more than 98% of cyanobacteria were removed in the treatment processes, and 
most were removed at the dissolved air floatation (DAF) unit.  Although the overall removal 
3Introduction  
The presence of cyanobacteria in drinking water sources as well as recreational waters has 
received increasing attention world wide (Chorus, 2005).  This cyanobacteria problem 
commonly occurs in eutrophic reservoirs and lakes. According to the monitoring results from 
2000 to 2004 by Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TWEPA, 2005), more 
than half of Taiwan’s 20 major reservoirs were characterized as eutrophic based on the 
Trophic Carlson State Index (TCSI).  Besides the eutrophic conditions, because of Taiwan’s 
tropical weather, cyanobacteria problems are present in many drinking water reservoirs.  For 
example, all the major drinking water reservoirs in Kin-Men Island are eutrophic and possess 
cyanobacterial problems.  
 In eutrophic sources waters, two groups of cyanobacterial metabolites are commonly 
present, including toxins and taste and odor (T&O) compounds (Chorus, 2005; Suffet and 
Mallevialle, 1995).  Among the toxins and T&O compounds, microcystins and 2-MIB were 
commonly observed in Kin-Men Island (Lin and Tseng, 2005).  To have a better water 
treatment efficiency in Kin-Men’s waterworks, a more precise understanding of the algal 
metabolites at different time and depths in the water sources as well as the change of 
metabolites in the treatment processes is needed.   In this study, the diurnal concentration 
change of the two major algal metabolites in a major source water (Tai–Lake Reservoir) and 
major waterworks (Tai-Lake Waterworks) of the island was investigated.  Two times of 
intensive water sampling was conducted for the reservoir.  The samples were analyzed for 
cyanobacteria and their metabolites.  The data were then assessed for their correlations and 
their change with time and depths.  In addition, the samples at different processes in the 
waterworks were also collected and analyzed.   The removal efficiency of the cyanobacteria 
and their associated metabolites were evaluated. 
5Experimental Procedures 
Water Sampling 
Two times of water sampling were conducted in TLR and TLW, one in 10-11 August and 
one in 9-10 September, 2005.  In the first time of sampling in TLR, water was taken directly 
from the raw water intake of the Tai-Lake Waterworks for consecutively 24 hours.  During 
that period, TLW drew water from TLR only, and seven samples were taken.  In the second 
time, water samples were collected near the raw water intake in TLR at four different depths, 
including 0 m, 1 m, 2.5 m, and 4 m from the water surface, during a 28 hours period.  At each 
depth, 8 samples were collected during the time period.  To understand the removal 
efficiency of cyanobacteria and algal metabolites, water samples at the effluent of different 
treatment processes in TLW were also taken and analysis, including raw water, dissolved air 
flotation, rapid sand filtration, slow sand filtration, and finished water.  In each of the two 
sampling periods, two samples, one in the first day and one in the second day, were collected 
for the process water in TLW.  The water samples collected were placed either in plastic vials 
(for chlorophyll-a analysis and algae cell count) or in amber glass vials (for 2-MIB and 
microcystins analysis).  All the samples except that for the analysis of cyanobacteria cell 
count were stored at 4qC before analysis. 
Chemicals
The standard of microcystin LR was purchased from Supelco (analytical grade, USA) and 
other microcystins (YR, RR, LF, and LW) were from End Biosciences (analytical grade, 
USA).  The analytical standard for 2-MIB was purchased from Sigma (analytical grade, 
Germany) at a concentration of 2 mg/L, while that for geosmin was obtained from Wako 
7(2005).  For all the analysis, the oven temperature (Model CTO-10Avp, Shimadzu, Japan) 
was maintained at 40qC.  The calibration curves for microcystins LR and RR were 
established from between 1 and 1,000 ng/L, and were between 10 and 1,000 ng/L for 
microcystins YR, LF, and LW.  All the calibration curves were highly linear with regression 
coefficients (R
2
 ) > 0.997. 
Analysis of 2-MIB and Geosmin 
The concentrations of 2-MIB and geosmin were analyzed using the solid-phase 
microextraction (SPME) coupled with a gas chromatograph (GC, 6890, Agilent, USA) and a 
mass spectrometer (MS, 5973, Agilent, USA).  A commercially available fiber, 75 Pm
DVB/CAR/PDMS (No. 57328-U) from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA)) were selected for the 
extraction of geosmin and 2-MIB.  The procedure for the analysis of 2-MIB and geosmin was 
the same as that prescribed by the standard method NIEA W537.50B of Taiwan EPA, and is 
almost identical with Standard Methods 6040D (APHA et al., 2000).  Detailed information 
regarding the operation of GC, including injection port, column, carrier gas, and oven 
temperature program, and the retention time of geosmin and 2-MIB were reported in Lin et al. 
(2002).  The calibration curves for these two compounds were established from between 1 
and 200 ng/L, with high linearity and high regression coefficients (R
2
 > 0.995). 
Cell Counts of Cyanobacteria and Microcystis 
Cyanobacterial cell densities were determined by the method similar to Standard Method 
10200 (APHA et al., 2000).  After sampling, Lugol’s solution was added into the samples, at 
a concentration of 0.3 mL-Lugol’s solution per 100 mL of sample for preservation.  Before 
cell counting, a defined volume of sample was filtered through 25-mm cellulose acetate filter 
(0.20 Pm, Advantec MFS, USA) for concentration.  The cyanobacteria and microsystis cell 
9samples collected in September 9-10, 2005.  Since the concentrations of geosmin were much 
smaller than those for 2-MIB, the data were not included here.  As shown in the table, the 
mean concentrations at the four sampling depths are very different and their corresponding 
standard deviations are very large for most of the parameters measured, indicating that their 
concentration changes were large.  These parameters with large variation include chlorophyll-
a concentration, cyanobacterial cell count, microcystis sp. cell count, and microcystins 
concentration.  Unlike the parameters with large variation, the means of 2-MIB at four depths 
were very similar, and the standard deviations are only around 10% to the corresponding 
means.  The results that 2-MIB is uniformly distributed in the water are in consistent with 
those in the August samples. 
 Figure 2 illustrated the concentration change of microcystins and 2-MIB for the 
September samples at four different depths.  Similar to that displayed in Figure 1, 2-MIB 
concentration did not change much in the 24 hour period, even though the depths of sampling 
were different.  Most of the 2-MIB concentrations fall within the range of 8 to 12 ng/L.  
Although no cell-bound and dissolved phases of 2-MIB were measured in this study, the 
investigation in Feng-Shen Reservoir, Taiwan suggested that only 10% of 2-MIB was cell-
bound in the reservoir (Lin and Chang, 2002).  This may infer that 2-MIB was likely to 
uniformly distribute in the reservoir water, or at least at the location near the raw water intake.  
Unlike that for 2-MIB, the concentrations of microcystins did change a lot with time and 
water depth.  However, no clear trend for microcystins concentrations, either in spatial or 
time trend, can be observed in the figure. 
Correlation of cyanobacteria  and cyanobacterial metabolites 
To find out the relation between cyanobacteria cells and cyanobacterial metabolites, simple 
linear correlations were performed for each pair of parameters measured in the September 
11
Removal of Cyanobacteria and Their Metabolites in TLW 
Figure 4 displays the concentration changes of cyanobacteria and microcystis cells along the 
treatment trains.  The data shown in the figure represent an average (and standard deviation) 
of two times of sampling, except that for microcystis cells in Figure 4a, in which only one set 
of data was obtained.  As shown in the figure, about 82-91% of cyanobacteria and 80-83 % of 
microcystis cells were removed at the floatation process.  This high removal efficiency of 
cyanobacteria cells in the dissolved air flotation (DAF) unit is similar to that reported by 
Hrudey et al. (1999).  They did a review in the removal efficiency of cyanobacteria using 
DAF process.  The characteristics of cyanobacteria may affect the removal efficiency.  As 
much as 90-100% removal can be found for anabaena, 40-80% were for microcystis, and 
only 30% were for Oscillatoria.   For most DAF systems, 80% removal of algae may be 
reached, which is in the same range as we observed for TLW. 
The figure also suggested that rapid filtration unit at TLW did not significantly reduce 
the concentrations of cyanobacteria and microcystis cells.   In the whole treatment processes, 
more than 95% of the cyanobacteria cells were removed before the slow filtration unit.  
However, one of the samples with very high concentrations of cyanobacteria cells in the 
effluent of slow sand filter as shown in the September data (Figure 4b).  Since the slow sand 
filter is exposed to the air and the retention time was around 7 hours, cyanobacteria may re-
grow on the water above the filter. In addition, one of the filters may not be in the best 
operational condition, causing the elevated cyanobacteria concentration in the effluent of SSF.
Although the cyanobacteria cell removal efficiency was as high as 98-99% for the whole 
treatment processes in TLW, there are still some cyanobacteria and microcystis cells in the 
finished water.  Cyanobacteria concentrations at 100 to 800 cells/mL were detected in the 
four finished water samples, while microcystis cells were observed in two of the samples at 
13
waterworks included pre-chlorination, coagulation/sedimentation, and rapid sand filtration.  
The removal efficiency of 60-90% at TLW was much higher than that reported by Lin et al. 
(2002) at 40-50%.  This high 2-MIBʳ removal efficiency may be linked to the presence of  
slow sand filtration unit in TLW.  Indeed, an extra 20-30% of 2-MIB removal may be 
observed in the slow sand filter, as shown in Figure 5. 
Conclusions
Measurement of cyanobacteria, microcystis sp., chlorophyll-a, microcystins and 2-MIB 
concentrations were conducted in Tai–Lake Reservoir and Waterworks.  Two 24 hour 
intensive water sampling were conducted at/near the water intake, and one of them was 
sampled at 4 different depths.  Most of the parameters measured except 2-MIB concentration 
varied significant at different depths and different time.    Only 2-MIB concentration did not 
change much within 24 hour period, even though the depths of sampling were different.  It is 
suggested that 2-MIB was likely to uniformly distribute in the lake water, or at least at the 
location near the intake.  For most of the cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial metabolites 
measured, no strong correlations were observed.  However, a good correlation existed 
between microcystis sp. and microcystins concentrations, indicating that the probable 
relationship between the toxin and its producer.  This simple correlation may also be used in 
estimating the cell-bound and dissolved microcystins in the reservoir.  For the monitoring 
data at the waterworks, more than 98% of cyanobacteria were removed in the treatment 
processes, and most were removed at the DAF unit.  The overall removal efficiency of 
microcystins and 2-MIB in TLW is >75%, and however, only 20-30% were removed before 
DAF.  This may be attributed to that DAF cannot effectively remove dissolved pollutants that 
were already present in the raw water or were released into water from the breakage of
