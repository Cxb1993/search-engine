CHAPTER  1 
Introduction 
1-1 Evolution and Applications of Fiber-Optics Communication 
Systems with Plastic Optical Fibers (POF) 
In the recent years, optical fiber communication has become the 
most important communication media in the world due to the low 
attenuation character and high data transmission rate. How to increase the 
coupling efficiency and lower the system cost have become a major 
objective. However, the system with a laser diode and a single mode 
optical fiber require a high precision alignment. It results in a high system 
cost and limits the application range. Hence, a more general fiber-optic 
communication system with a plastic optical fiber (POF) and light 
emitting diode (LED) is developed. 
POFs were first commercialized in 1970s. The first SI POF was 
made by Dupont in 1968. This POF had a high transmission loss over 
500dB/km. After years of hard works of molecular engineering such as 
perfluorination and deuteration of polymers, the transmission loss below 
50dB/km for POFs becomes possible. Its applications are also enlarged 
day by day. Though, it has a much larger transmission loss and lower 
bandwidth compared with a glass fiber. It still has some advantages over 
a glass fiber as: (1)Mechanical flexibility makes it resistant to impact and 
vibrations, and durable small bending radius.(2)Easy handling and low 
 3
higher output power and a narrower pattern as a high-brightness LED 
with a ring type electrode[8]. However, they are relative uneconomic, 
have shorter lives, and not so robust compared with a surface emitting 
LED. 
Some researchers also select some optical sources which emit light 
at the wavelength located within the lower attenuation window of core 
material. Such as 510nm in the green spectrum[9]. But the Si detector has 
a lower response at this wavelength compared with that at 650nm. It 
probably may not benefit from this configuration. 
2. To re-distribute the emitting pattern out of LED. 
In 1983[10], Shealy and Berg added a spherical lens between the 
LED and optical fiber to make the light more concentrative. But only the 
results base on a ray tracing method was performed. In 1999[11], Park et 
al formed a microlens on a surface emitting LED. The coupling efficiency 
had increased 1.5 times than the original value of a flat-ended fiber. 
In 2001[12] and 2002[13], Lazarus proposed a bulb lens antenna 
system to improve the coupling efficiency. It is a fan-shaped lens with 
two curved edges in a lateral view. The convex one is larger and is used to 
concentrate the light from source. The small concave edge located at the 
focal point of the large one functions to bend the rays from the large edge 
to have a smaller incident angle at fiber end face. As the POF end is put 
coincident with the small curved edge to have the largest coupling power. 
At the same time, multi-source coupling scheme becomes possible due to 
its large lens size. However, the bulb antenna system has a so large 
volume make it uneasy to handle. Its extraordinary shape also need 
 5
has a high modulation capacity. In 2002[9], Akhter achieved 200Mbit/s 
through a distance of 100m by using a system with a plastic optical fiber 
with NA=0.3 and an InGaN/GaN LED. And the attenuation of POF has 
achieved 50dB/km following the progress of molecular engineering. To 
increase the coupling efficiency and lower the system cost becomes an 
important objective. 
However, few analyses focused on the optical coupling 
configuration with POFs and LEDs have been reported. No one even has 
constructed a simulation model to study the coupling system with high 
precision. Hence, both the experiments and the ray tracing method are 
used to investigate the coupling behavior between a surface emitting LED 
and a plastic optical fiber. 
Besides this, when designing a fiber lens to increase the coupling 
efficiency of a optical fiber, different optical sources will result in totally 
different results, such as different light emitting patterns, and different 
sizes of emitting areas. Considering a LED source, its output pattern is 
influenced by various factors, such as the structure of die, shape of die, 
the existence of reflection cup, and the shape of the encapsulated lens. In 
order to investigate how different end shapes contribute to the coupling 
efficiency of a POF with less effects from the variations of source. A 
surface emitting LED with a Lambertian pattern out of emitting surface, 
no reflection cup, and a flat encapsulated lens is used as the optical source 
in this study. Also, owing to its largest range of emitting angles, the 
optical fiber will has the lowest efficiency. The results can thus become a 
reference when any other optical source is used. 
Since a specific end shape does not guarantee a high efficiency for a

CHAPTER 2 
The Simulation Model of LED-POF Optical 
Communication Systems 
2-1 Optical Communication Systems with LED and POF Devices 
A surface emitting LED and a step-index (SI) POF are employed in this work. The 
LED transmitter, TOTX179P, fabricated by TOSHIBA, has a die material of Gallium 
Arsenide (GaAs) and emits light at a peak of 650nm. The SI POF, SH 4001, with 
NA=0.51 used here is made by Mitsubishi Rayon. Characters of TOTX179P and 
SH4001 are listed in Table 2-1[17], and Table 2-2[18] respectively. In Table 2-2, some 
other fiber types of Mitsubishi Rayon with different sizes and different NAs are also 
listed. They will be included in the simulations. 
2-2 LED Optical Characters 
In solid-state lighting, photons are generated in the active region of LED die by the 
recombination of electrons and holes. With its randomly directed character, any point 
inside the active region can be treated as a point source which has a uniform intensity 
distribution around the whole 4π  solid angle, see Fig. 2.1(a). Any specific light pattern 
out of LED die is resulted from the following packaging, such as refractive indices of die 
and the outer material, the geometry of die, and the applied current intensity distribution, 
etc. 
For a LED die with a geometry of parallelepiped, each chip has 5 flat emitting 
surfaces, 1 upper surface, and 4 side surfaces. The emitting pattern out of each surface 
can be derived from a point source and a flat surface, shown in Fig. 2.1(b). Where 
 and α β  are the incident and exit angles related to the normal of the flat surface. 
According to Snell’s law,  and α β  can be related as sin sindie outn nα β= . After 
 9
ray(b) can propagates in the fiber base on the geometric optics. According to the analysis 
by Synder [19,20] in 1974 and 1975, it is classified as a refracting leaky mode due to 
repeatedly refractions at the core-cladding interface. It can propagate in an optical fiber 
only few millimeters long. Synder also indicated the loss mechanism is a wave 
phenomenon, called radiation loss. Hence, only ray(c) can be guided along optical fiber. 
There are still some rays that can’t be described by geometric optics, called 
tunneling rays. Fig. 2.4 shows angles for describing rays propagate along POF at a point 
P on the core-cladding interface. NP is the surface normal through point P. PR is the ray 
projection on fiber cross section (on x-y plane). PT is the tangent through P. φ  is the 
angle of incidence or reflection at P. zφ  is the angle between the ray and QP which is 
parallel to the fiber axis z. xyφ  is the angle on fiber cross plane between ray projection 
PR and the tangent PT. The condition for a ray to be bound becomes 0 ( / 2 )z cφ π φ≤ ≤ − , 
independent of xyφ [21]. This is because Snell’s law is derived from a planar optical 
waveguide, however the fiber interface is curved.  
These three types of rays are defined as follows[21]: 
Bound rays:         0 ( / 2 )z cφ π φ≤ ≤ −  
Refracted rays:    0  cφ φ≤ ≤  
Tunneling rays:   ( / 2 ) / 2   and   / 2c z cπ φ φ π φ φ π− ≤ ≤ ≤ ≤  
Both bound rays and tunneling rays are guided in the core region. However, 
tunneling rays radiate some power into cladding every time when they are incident at 
core-cladding interface. According to the analysis by Synder in 1975 [20], these rays 
take hundreds of meters of propagation distance to totally attenuate. For a plastic optical 
fiber, short-hual applications, they can’t be ignored. Hence, they are remained in the ray 
tracing model. The difference between the experiments and simulations from the 
additional power loss of tunneling rays is further discussed in appendix.

conditions, and the applied current density, etc. Otherwise, this method will result in a 
butterfly effects, a little difference in the initial setup will lead to a large error in the final 
results. 
A simplified process is applied in this work. As the optical properties mentioned in 
section 2-2, the light pattern out of LED chip is assumed to be a cosine distribution 
(Lambertian) with uniform-distributed intensity across each emitting surface. Only the 
relative intensity of upper and side emitting surfaces should be determined. For a LED 
die with parallelepiped shape, each chip has 5 flat emitting surfaces, 1 up surface, and 4 
side surfaces, shown in Fig. 2.6. Due to the direction of applied current and the thin 
geometry of active region, the intensity difference between upper and side emitting 
surfaces may be large. 
A proposed optimization process used to roughly determine the relative intensity is 
performed here. First, set a government equation which is the root mean square error 
between the experimental and the simulation coupling efficiency of a flat-ended POF. 
( )2exp1RMS simnE P Pn= −∑                                  (2-5) 
Where sim side side up upP c P c P= +    
ERMS is the root mean square error, n is number of data, and exp   simP P   are the arrays 
of coupling efficiency of a POF at various positions. The subscripts exp, and sim denote 
experiment and simulation respectively. The simulation coupling efficiency is a 
combination of the upper and side emitting surfaces. The constants   side upc c  can be 
determined as RMSE  is a minimum, then they are used to determine the relative intensity 
of emitting surfaces. The optimization result will be discussed later after conducting the 
experiment of a flat-ended POF. 
Numbers of rays used for ray tracing are 61200, and 30000 4×  for upper and side 
surfaces respectively. These numbers are just a reference, since rays will be split in the 
tracing process.

a Si detector. This power meter has a accuracy of ±0.2dB(±5%) at 850nm, -20dBm. It 
shows the difference of power between the defined value and the measured one. This 
accuracy seems not sufficient for a single measurement. However, the fluctuation of 
accuracy of a single power meter is small, it’s treated as a constant in this work. For the 
study on optical coupling efficiency, this equipment is sufficient to read the relative 
coupling power on various conditions. 
Power supply 
According to the datasheet of TOTX179P[17], a moderate voltage is applied as 5±
0.005V by a high stability DC power supply, HP E3610A, shown in Fig. 3.4(b). The 
corresponding driving current is about 13.5mA. 
Thermo meter 
Since the output power of LED is sensitive to temperature, all experiments in this 
study is conducted within a temperature range, 26.5~27.5 °C. The environmental 
temperature is measured by a thermo meter, TES 1307 K/J thermometer, with a j-type 
thermocouple attached at a position about 1 cm from the LED edge. 
3-2 Flat-ended POF 
A flat-ended POF is studied first. Its optical coupling efficiency can also be treated 
as a reference data for further design of different end shapes. And the most importance is 
that this data is necessary for a complete construction of the simulation model. It must be 
employed into the government equation to determine the relative intensity of LED 
emitting surfaces. 
3-2-1 Formation of Flat-ended POFs 
The plastic optical fiber used for experiments is SH4001 with core material of 
PMMA, which has a refractive index 1.492coren =  and a diameter 0.98mmcored = . The 
cladding material of SH4001 fiber is a fluorinated polymer, which has a refractive index 
 25
incident on the end face of a flat-ended SI POF, its coupling efficiency cη  can be 
described as[26-27]:

Where POFP  is the optical power coupled into POF, LEDP  is LED output power. 
a  is the core radius of POF, and LEDr  is the radius of LED emitting surface. maxσ  is 
the maximum acceptance angle of POF, which is related to the numerical aperture as 
maxsinNA σ= . After substituting ( ) cosI σ σ=  into Eq. 3-2, the coupling efficiency can 
be rewritten as:

( )c
A NA

η =                                        (3-3) 
Where POFA  and LEDA  are the areas of POF end face and LED emitting surfaces 
respectively. If POF LEDA A≥ , all the rays out of LED can be incident on the POF end 
surface. The coupling efficiency of fiber approximately equals to the square of its 
numerical aperture, 2( )NAη = , i.e. 25% for a POF with NA=0.51. However, this 
equation is valid only when a uniform distribution intensity across the LED outer 
emitting surface (on the LED lens). 
For a real case, it’s impossible that all the rays can be incident on the end surface of 
POF. The intensity distribution out of the LED surface is not uniform either. Such as 
TOTX179P, its surface intensity has a diameter of 1.05mm defined by a 10% intensity 
edge of its peak value. It’s larger than the diameter of POF, and it will result in additional 
power loss. Besides this, a surface emitting LED contains not only one emitting surface, 
but also some side emitting surfaces. These side surfaces contribute much lower 
coupling efficiency since its emitting direction. Some minor factors also decrease the 
coupled power from the theoretical value, like material absorption and Fresnel’s 
 27
3-3 Ball-lensed POF 
Considering LED is an optical source with a large emitting area. To improve the 
coupling efficiency, the first idea out of our minds is that to form a large fiber lens at the 
fiber end to enlarge its receiving area, and by the curved shape to refract the rays to have 
a smaller propagation angle to increase its coupling efficiency. 
3-3-1 Material Properties of EPO-TEK 353ND 
To form a ball-lensed POF, a two-part epoxy with a slow hardening process and a 
high transmission at the wavelength of 650nm is a best solution. The material used for 
ball lens is EPO-TEK 353ND. It has been extensively used for semiconductor and 
optical fiber applications. It has a refractive index 1.569 @589nmlensn = [25]. And the 
material transmittance is measured by a spectrophotometer, U4100 (see Fig. 3.13). Fig. 
3.14(a) shows the measured transmission varies with optical wavelength. (with 
650nmλ = , the transmittance is 86.24%T ≈ ). 
Considering the measured optical power from the exit end is a summation of all the 
light beams that transmit through the specimen. If a light beam has a initial intensity of 
oI . When transmitting through the specimen, it would undergo twice of Fresnel’s 
reflection by the entrance and exit surfaces, and an exponential attenuation as the 
specimen thickness[26-27]. The intensity out of the exit surface can be described as 
2(1 ) exp( )o FI I r tλα= − −  
Where Fr  is the Fresnel’s reflectivity, and it is estimated according to the 
refractive indices of the two materials at the interface. In this case, 1 1.569n =  for the 
specimen and 2 1n =  for air, 0.049Fr ≈ . Because of two interfaces of the ray path, oI  
should be multiplied by 2(1 )Fr− . λα  is the material absorption coefficient at a specific 
wavelength λ . And t is the specimen thickness. In order to have the material absorption

inactive part of ball lens which is behind the end of fiber (see Fig. 3.15), a 
sphere-truncated lenses are still applied here to approximate its shape of active for 
consistence. The parameters used for simulation are 0.574   0.466b br mm q mm= =  for 
fb-1, 0.643   0.338b br mm q mm= =  for fb-2, 0.727br mm=  0.219bq mm=  for fb-3, 
0.826br mm=  0.185bq mm=  for fb-4. 
3-3-3 Ball-lensed POF Analysis and Butt Coupling Efficiency bcη  
In order to show the improvement more clearly, a improvement factor at butt joint 
is defined as /ball flatm η η= . Where ballη  and flatη  are the butt coupling efficiency of a 
ball-lensed POF and flat-ended POF respectively. flatη  equals to 18.14% for 
experiments and 18.35% for simulations. 
The optical coupling efficiency versus misalignments of these 4 samples is shown 
in Fig. 3.17~3.20. The experimental improvement factors at butt joint are 1.475, 1.61, 
1.732, and 1.736 for sample fb-1~fb-4 respectively. And the corresponding simulation 
results are 1.48, 1.63, 1.79, and 1.87. It can be seen that the experiments and simulations 
have a good agreement. Only the larger difference of sample fr-4 occurs. It may result 
from the assumption of light pattern out of LED chip. 
Further study on various dimensions of ball lens is performed based on the 
simulation model. The coupling efficiency versus radius br  and tip width bq  for 
SH4001 POFs are shown in Fig. 3.21(a). It can be seen that the best solution of bq  for 
each radius curvature is the smallest value. As qb increases, the coupling efficiency 
decreases. Fig.3.21(b) also shows the butt coupling efficiency decreases as qb increases 
for 4 specific radius, rb=0.55, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5mm. The result is different from what is 
predicted initially. If the ball lens does play a role as increasing the receiving area of 
POF, qb is definitely not the smallest value for the best coupling efficiency since the 
inactive part of ball lens. And these disappointed results can be explained as follows. 
 31
SH6001 1.98m = .For MH4001 is rb=0.8mm, qb =0.176mm. cη  can be improved from 
6.26% to 19.8%, and MH4001 3.16m = . It also shows the tendency, the larger the diameter 
of POF, the larger the improvement factor can be achieved. And the smaller the 
numerical aperture, the larger the improvement factor due to its original low coupling 
efficiency of a flat-ended POF. 
3-4 Tip-rounded POF 
From the analyses of in the previous section, the large ball lens is not necessary. A 
simplified fiber lens from ball lens is presented here, called tip-rounded fiber lens shown 
in Fig. 3.24. Its shape is also truncated from a sphere, but the POF is lensed only at the 
tip region. Its dimension can also be seen as a ball-lensed POF with part A only, and with 
the smallest tip width qb. 
3-4-1 Formation of Tip-rounded POFs 
The material used for forming a tip-rounded POF is the same as for a ball-lensed 
POF, 353ND epoxy. To form a tip-rounded POF, a flat-ended POF should be prepared 
first. Then carefully let the flat end face touch the mixed epoxy, but not immerged. In 
order to let the epoxy spread all around the end surface, move the POF in a small range 
repeatedly when the end surface still have contact with the epoxy. Finally, pull the POF 
out, and hang it in a vertical position. The difference from the section of forming a 
ball-lended POF is that the tip-rounded end should be put upward related to the ground. 
This is found out empirically to have a tip more close to a truncated sphere. There is 
only one parameter of tip-rounded POF. That is the radius curvature rp shown in Fig. 
3.24. The radius can be easily controlled by removing the epoxy from the tip. Since the 
epoxy is a highly viscous material and has a slow hardening process, the surface 
condition remains good after removing some tip material. 
 33
index of an optical plastic material which has a high material transmittance and is 
commercially available is limited within the range, n=1.4~1.6. The applied materials 
here are with refractive index of nlens=1.492(PMMA), nlens=1.569(EPO-TEK 353ND), 
and nlens=1.6. From the figure, it can be seen that there is no large difference of coupling 
efficiency between these three lens materials. The maximum butt coupling efficiency 
occurs as rp=0.9~1.0mm. Only a little higher coupling efficiency can be achieved by 
employing the lens material with higher index. Hence, it can be concluded as: for a 
tip-rounded POF, the lens dimension dominates the coupling efficiency, and lens 
material has no significant effects while the index range of the optical plastic material is 
limited. 
The simulation results for other fiber types are shown in Fig. 3.34. Fig. 3.34(a) 
shows the butt efficiency of tip-rounded POFs with the same numerical aperture 0.51 but 
different diameters 1.5mm, 1.0mm, 0.75mm, and 0.5mm. The horizontal dashed lines in 
the figure indicate the butt coupling efficiency bcη  of a flat-ended POF for each fiber 
type respectively. The maximum improvement factor for each fiber type are 
SH6001 1.99m =  at rp=1.2mm, SH4001 1.917m =  at rp=1mm, SH3001 1.64m =  at rp=0.8mm, 
and SH2001 1.2m =  at rp=0.8mm. It is obvious that the larger the diameter of POF the 
larger the improvement can be achieved. It can be explained straight forward by the 
difference of the receiving area between different fibers. 
Fig. 3.34(b) shows the butt coupling efficiency bcη  of tip-rounded POFs with the 
same diameter dF=1.0mm but different numerical aperture 0.51 and 0.3 respectively. The 
best result for NA=0.51 is SH4001 1.917m =  at rp=1mm, and for NA=0.3 is 
MH4001 3.16m =  at rp=0.7mm. 
The above results show that the tip-rounded POFs can work as good as ball-lensed 
POFs for all the five different types of fibers. And they have the additional advantages as 
easier for connection (since its small end size), easier for formation (the tip lens is hardly 
 35
By the difference of refractive indices between the outer and the taper material, total 
internal reflection occurs at the taper edge. Considering a ray have a incident angle inθ  
at the fiber end, the original propagation angle of it inside POF is 1φ . If it can be bent 
the taper edge with a taper angle tθ , the new propagation angle 2 12 tφ θ φ= − . 2φ  is 
probably to be negative (downward relative to z axis), if the incident angle inθ  is large 
enough and can be reflected by the taper edges. However, the new propagation angle 
after reflection is always smaller than the original one that 2 1φ φ< . For 1 2 tφ θ> , 2φ  is 
negative, and can be written as 2 1 2 tφ φ θ= − . The new propagation angle must be 
smaller than the original one. For 1 2 tφ θ< , the new propagation angle 2φ  still has the 
same sign as 1φ . Considering the geometric relation between 1φ  and 2φ  in the figure, 
2φ  must be smaller than 1φ . Hence a smaller propagation angle in POF can benefit from 
a taper geometry. The maximum acceptance angle of inθ  at the input end will be 
enlarged from maxθ  of a flat-ended POF to ( )max 2 tθ θ+  of a taper-end POF. 
Since the taper is formed from the core region, its material is PMMA with index 
equal to 1.492. Originally, the core material is covered by its cladding, 1.402outn = . It 
leads to a small index difference at the taper edges. Rays can be bent by the taper edges 
hence are limited to a small amount. In order to let the taper bend rays more sufficiently, 
the cladding is removed in the taper region to have a outer material with 1airn = . 
3-5-1 Formation of Taper-ended POFs 
Two methods are used to form a taper-ended POF, chemical-etched and 
hot-drawing processes. Both of them are applicable, and will be introduced below. 
3-5-1-1 Chemical Etching processes of POFs 
A chemical etching process of POFs used here is based on the proposed method in 
1998 by Merchant et al[28]. This method can be used to remove the Cytop-doped 
 37
can be removed by pure acetone[28]. A lint-free lens tissue with pure acetone on it is 
used. Cladding can be easily removed by rotating and sliding the tissue along the 
treatment region. The removal process should be done only in few seconds, and with 
great care to prevent break of fiber and damage of core surface as the core material will 
become extremely brittle in this process. Third, the solution is highly volatile, its vapor 
also etches the POF even it is not immerged. To prevent this damage, Vaseline is used as 
an isolation layer. An end-cladding-stripped POF and a Vaseline-smeared POF are 
shown in Fig. 3.39(a) and (b). Something should be taken specially account that if the 
Vaseline is not used, vapor will do a serious and irregular damage to the cladding in the 
region that is not immerged into the solvent. A taper-ended POF, sample St-1, with 
smeared cladding damaged by solvent vapor is shown in Fig. 3.40(a). This smeared 
cladding will result in additional power loss shown in Fig. 3.40(b). It can also be seen 
from the coupling results. Fig. 3.41 shows that the experimental efficiency of St-1 is 
much lower than that by simulations. 
Only 2 samples are formed by the chemical-etched method. Since the formation 
quality will easily be influenced by the environmental temperature, humidity, air flow 
through the POF, and the immerged depth, etc. If there are no equipments that can 
control these parameters within a small fluctuation range, it’s not easy to have a desired 
taper geometry. The experimental photographs of these two samples are shown in Fig. 
3.42, with dimensions 6.04 1 , 0.88 0.02o ot tq mm mmθ = ± = ±  for St-2, and 
5.15 0.15 , 1.23 0.01o ot tq mm mmθ = ± = ±  for St-3. Some fluctuations of dimensions are 
due to the asymmetric of the taper. For simplicity, a symmetry taper geometry is 
employed in the simulation model. Its dimension is an average value of the up and down 
edges on the photos. The difference between them is thus shown as the fluctuations. 
Some dimensional inaccuracy still comes from the photo resolution and sample tilts 
when photographing, however they are relatively small. The optical coupling efficiency 
 39
the simulation results conform to the experimental results. A taper end shape does 
improve the coupling efficiency of a POF. The experimental improvement factors are 
2.13, 1.95, 2.28, 2.18, 2.07, 2.01, 1.55, and 1.5 for sample St-2, St-3, Sd-1, Sd-2, Sd-3, 
Sd-4, Sd-5, and Sd-6 respectively. The maximum experimental coupling efficiency 
achieves 41.34% by Sd-1, which is much larger than 32.08% achieved by a tip-rounded 
POF. The corresponding simulated improvement factors of each sample are 2.21, 2.08, 
2.3, 2.28, 2.14, 2.06, 1.61, and 1.55. There are little difference between the experimental 
and the simulation values. Hence the further discussion about the taper-ended POFs will 
be base on the simulation results for simplicity. 
The butt coupling efficiency bcη  of taper-ended POFs with various taper angle tθ  
and taper length tq (which is normalized by the fiber diameter: /t Fq d ) are shown in 
Fig. 3.52. Fig. 3.51(a)~(e) show the results of different fiber types for SH6001, SH4001, 
SH3001, SH2001, and MH4001 respectively. A dashed contour is also plotted on each 
figure that indicates the efficiency of its flat-ended POF. Obviously, the larger the 
diameter of POF the larger the range of shape parameters that ensure a taper-ended POF 
is superior to a flat-ended POF. The maximum butt coupling efficiency of a taper-ended 
SH6001 POF is 58.04% ( SH6001 3.124m = ) is achieved by a taper with 10otθ =  and 
1.4tq mm= .The maximum bcη  of SH4001 fibers is 43.2% ( SH4001 2.354m = ) as 8otθ =  
and 0.8tq mm= . The maximum bcη  of SH3001 fibers is 32.61% ( SH3001 1.749m = ) as 
7.5otθ =  and 0.5tq mm= . The maximum bcη  of SH2001 fibers is 19.19% 
( SH2001 1.183m = ) as 5otθ =  and 0.3tq mm= . And the maximum bcη  of MH4001 
fibers is 25.69% ( MH4001 4.104m = ) is achieved as 11otθ =  and 0.8tq mm= . It is 
obvious that, as the diameter of POF is too small compared with the size of the emitting 
surface of LED, taper geometry contributes nothing to the coupling power. In this case, 
the emitting surface of TOTX179P LED has a diameter of 1.05mm defined by the 10% 
intensity edge. However, the diameter of a SH2001 POF is 0.5mm much smaller than 
 41
coupling area of POF due to the inactive part behind the flat end face of POF and the 
index limitation of lens material. A modified tip-rounded fiber lens thus is applied. The 
results exhibit that it not only can work as good as it, but also have a more impact shape. 
Since the maximum coupling efficiency of the ball-lensed and tip-rounded POFs 
are still far away from the total power of LED. Another reflection-styled end shape is 
applied. A taper geometry is used here to serve as a reflector. By total internal reflection 
at the taper edges, rays can be bent to have a smaller propagation angle to be guided. The 
maximum coupling efficiency of a SH4001 POF can be further improved to 43.2% 
which is larger than that of a refraction-styled end shape.

CHAPTER 4 
Results and Discussions 
For an optical communication system, the coupling efficiency is a very important 
factor that should be considered first. It determines the maximum transmission distance 
of signal in an optical fiber, and system cost as well. Longer transmissible distance 
would lead to a small amount of components required in the system, like amplifiers and 
adaptors. Hence how the different end shapes of various fiber types contribute to the 
maximum improvement factor and the maximum transmissible distance is discussed first 
in section 4-1. 
A precision alignment between an LED and a POF can be easily achieved in the 
laboratory. However, it would become difficult for commercial products. In general, an 
adaptor with limited precision is provided. It proves only to adapt an LED and a POF 
within some range instead of a fixed joint. Within this range the LEDs and POFs must be 
designed to be applicable. 
Considering the tolerance of a commercial adapter used to align the LED and POF. 
Sometimes the optimum dimension of a specific end shape is not the best solution, since 
it often has a relative higher sensitivity of coupling power to misalignments. The system 
will easily become unreliable if the LED and POF are not properly connected. Hence 
how different shape parameters influence the efficiency sensitivity is studied in section 
4-2. 
4-1 Maximum Transmission Distance 
The butt coupling efficiency of various end shapes and different fiber types have 
been shown in chapter 3. The optimum solution of each end shape has been got by 
 99
effects on coupling efficiency, only the tip-rounded POF is discussed here. 
Two samples selected for a tip-rounded POF are with rp=0.7 and 1.5mm, and both 
have a butt coupling around 31.5%. The misalignment tolerances are shown in Fig. 4.2. 
The result of an optimum dimension with rp=1.0mm is also plotted for comparison. It is 
obviously that the larger the radius the longer the tolerance. 
Four taper-ended POFs are selected with similar butt coupling efficiency around 
36%. Two of them have the same taper length of 0.8mm but different taper angle, 5 and 
12.5°. The other two have the same taper angle of 8° but different taper length, 0.4 and 
1.3mm. An optimum dimension with 0.8mmtq =  and 8otθ =  is also chosen for 
reference. The result shows the misalignment tolerance has a great dependence on the 
fiber receiving area. Fig. 4.3 shows the tolerance versus the taper front diameter td . The 
larger the front diameter, the longer the tolerance both for longitudinal and lateral 
misalignments. 
From the above analysis, it can be concluded. The most important factor that 
dominates the sensitivity of coupling efficiency to misalignments is the effective 
receiving area of fiber end. For a tip-rounded POF, the larger the radius the larger the 
effective receiving area. For a taper-ended POF, the larger the front diameter the larger 
the effective receiving area. 
A sensitivity comparison between different end shapes is also discussed here. For 
simplicity, only the dimension with the maximum butt coupling efficiency for each 
shape is discussed. The results are shown in Fig. 4.4. It can seen that the taper-ended 
POF has a shorter longitudinal tolerance of 0.33mm compared with 0.37mm of the 
tip-rounded POF, but it has a larger lateral tolerance of 0.35mm compared with 0.31mm. 
There is no significant difference between them. However, considering the larger butt 
coupling efficiency of the taper-ended POF, a taper end would be a better choice for 
fiber-optics system with a POF and an LED.

7. The sensitivity of coupling efficiency to misalignments depends strongly on the 
effective receiving area of a POF. The larger the coupling area the lower sensitivity of 
coupling efficiency. 
5-2 Further Works 
5-2-1 Bandwidth an Attenuation of POFs 
Bandwidth of an optical fiber is often determined by its original fiber types, like 
different numerical apertures and different refractive index profiles. In general, the 
smaller the numerical aperture the higher the bandwidth, and a fiber with 
multi-step-index and graded-index profile will result in higher bandwidth than the one 
with a step-index profile. However, for short-distance applications, the equilibrium mode 
distribution of light in POF is not reached yet. The modal distribution in fiber greatly 
depends on the launching conditions from optical sources. 
In 1991[29], S. Takahashi and K. Ichimura experimentally show the bandwidth of 
POFs will be influenced by the launching conditions and the length of fiber due to the 
different modal distributions in POFs. Two different launch conditions were used as 
NA=0.1 and NA=0.65. The measured -3 dB bandwidth as LF=20m are 1600MHz for 
NA=0.1 and 120MHz for NA=0.65. As the length increases, the bandwidth difference as 
different launch conditions will decrease due to the mode coupling occurs gradually in 
fiber. And the measured bandwidth as LF=100m are 192MHz and 42.3MHz for NA=0.1 
and 0.65 respectively. 
In this work, some specific end shapes are used to improve the coupling efficiency 
based on re-distributing the propagation angles of rays inside POF. The angle 
distributions in POFs are different from each other as different end shapes are employed. 
If the launch NA can be associated with the fiber end geometry, or to construct a 
dispersion model which can related to the angle distribution in POF is possible. The

( )1 2 2 2 22sin / 1 ( / )core cladn n r a− − − . Rays in this elliptical cone are not all bound rays, and 
can be categorized into two parts: bound and tunneling rays. In Fig. A.1(b), the hollow 
round area is the acceptance cone of bound rays, and its size and shape is identical 
wherever the incident position is. Out of the round of acceptance cone is classified as the 
tunneling rays, and its size and shape will vary with the radial incident position. These 
rays will lose some power into cladding every time when it is incident at the 
core-cladding interface. However, the exact amount of power loss is not quantified for a 
specific incident angle, only one thing for sure is the larger the incident angle the larger 
the power loss. 
A-2 Attenuation of Tunneling Rays 
Regardless of material absorption, assume the power loss coefficient of tunneling 
rays for each incidence is tα . Assume n is the total number of incidence for a specific 
angle of a tunneling ray propagating a distance LF. The rest power of this ray can be 
described as an exponential function: 
0( ) exp( )tP n P nα= −                                   (A.2) 
Where 0P  is the initial power of a tunneling ray. 
Experimental results by Tomonari Y. and Yahei K.[30] also show this phenomenon. 
Fig. A.2[30] shows the measured output power of a plastic optical fiber with diameter 
1.0mm and NA=0.28(maximum acceptance angle ±16°) while varying the incident 
angle of an optical beam (with a beam diameter of 0.1mm). The results of (a) and (b) are 
for fiber length of 2 and 20m respectively. It can be seen that as r increases the 
maximum acceptance angle also increases. However, as rays propagate in longer 
distance, the optical power of a ray with incident angle larger than 16° will decrease 
dramatically. That is because of the loss of tunneling rays increases as the propagation 
 113
rays coupled into POF as lateral offset increases. And the attenuation of the tunneling 
rays increase exponentially with the propagation distance. The optical coupling 
efficiency of experiments and simulations should get closer and closer as the length of 
POF reduces. A simple experiment conducted here can prove it. 
A-3-1 Definition of a Fractional Value fraP  
In order to demonstrate the loss behavior of tunneling rays in various length of POF, 
the influence of material loss should be eliminated first. Setting a reference position of 
POF where the coupled power includes less tunneling rays and less influence from 
experimental setup is necessary. Then take the fractional value of cη  which is the 
coupling efficiency at an interesting position divided by the reference value would be a 
simple and proper solution. The fractional value is defined as 
.
(tunneling+bound)( )
(bound)fra F
PP L
P
=                          (A.3) 
Where (tunneling+bound)P  is the coupling power of POF at a position of interests, 
and (bound)P  is the coupling power at the reference position. The fractional value 
. F( )fraP L  by simulation is a constant value for all lengths of POF since no tunneling loss 
is included. However, in reality, the fractional value will vary with LF, the longer the 
propagation distance the lower the fractional value. And the experimental fractional 
value will approach the one of simulation as LF approaches zero.  
A-3-2 Set a Reference Position 
Considering the model studied in this work, if the POF has a sufficiently far 
longitudinal distance from LED, the coupled power from the upper emitting surface 
would contain no tunneling rays. Since the rays with large incident angle is lost already, 
only rays within the hollow acceptance cone (bound rays) have the chance to be incident
