護人員[10-12]；監控嬰兒的體溫可得知是否有發燒[13]；在睡眠時量測呼吸頻率及心跳頻率分析出睡眠
品質[14]，而預防高血壓和高血壓的管理也是不可忽略的，透過簡單的生活方式和血壓的量測紀錄可以
明顯的改善血壓問題[15]，因此也發展出網路血壓量測系統[16]，透過網路監控可以不必到醫院量測血
壓。除了生理訊號量測，健康照護也是相當重要的一環，隨著年齡的增長，罹患的慢性病可能不止一
種，當身上伴隨著許多不同疾病時，需要服用的藥品種類就會越來越多，使用上的限制與使用時間是
不容忽略的。用藥管理的基本概念，如警告使用者現在該吃藥，或者持續觀察未來幾天的用藥效果...
等[17-20]，透過RFID裝置辨識藥品[21]，利用增加重量量測來猜測是否有用藥，如果有吃藥則重量會
減輕，反之則不會有變化。 
 
  為了提升病患照護的品質，越來越多的醫院和健康照護中心使用行動監控和無線網路技術來提升
行動性和便利性[22-24]。例如Lin等人[25]開發了一套無線PDA的生理監視系統用在病患運輸上，利用
無線區域網路(WLAN)可以及時監控病患的生理資訊，不受導線限制。另外，也有國內學者利用RFID
的技術使用在癡呆病患的安全監控上[26]。隨著無線傳輸技術與家庭網路技術的蓬勃發展，也帶動網路
化家庭的應用與日俱增。無線感測器網路 (Wireless Sensor Networks, WSN)，是由一到數個無線資料收
集器以及為數眾多的感測器(sensors)所構成的網路系統，而元件之間的溝通則是採用無線的通訊方式。
為了達到大量佈建的目的，無線感測網路必須具備低成本、低耗電、體積小、容易佈建，並具有感應
環境裝置，可程式化、可動態組成等特性。無線感測器網路應用在生理信號的通訊傳輸上有許多技術
，例如紅外線、藍芽和ZigBee等等。由於紅外線的傳輸角度限制問題，較少使用在傳輸生理信號。雖
然在傳輸效率上藍芽比ZigBee好，但是ZigBee有較低的耗電量。可以對病人和對設施進行監測，並可
應用在追蹤、辨識及定位，這些技術除了可用在臨床病人外，也可對在家的居家老人進行照護。ZigBee
應用領域主要有家庭自動化、家庭安全、工業與環境控制與個人醫療照護[27-29]等，可搭配之應用產
品則有家電產品、消費性電子、PC 週邊產品與感測器等，供家電感測、無線PC 周邊控制、家電遙控
等功能。這些新技術與居家環境的結合，讓住戶能夠擁有更多的資訊擷取管道與更便利的居家管理及
照護方式。為了打造更優質的生活環境，許多國外著名的研究機構，已從理論與實作等方向，進行多
樣化智慧型家庭應用系統建置的研究計畫，如：美國麻省理工學院（MIT）電腦實驗室所建置的「
Intelligent Room」、美國喬治亞科技大學所發展的「Aware Home」等都是這方面的研究實例。IBM公
司也於IBM中國研究中心建立智慧型家庭的應用雛形系統，主要的功能包含：資訊娛樂應用、能源控
制應用與家庭保全應用等。 
 
  另一方面，由於IC 設計技術的進步，讓我們可以發展出多樣具多媒體播放功能的嵌入式系統，例
如數位相機和數位相框的發展。讓我們的照片、影片可以更方便的拍攝、儲存、播放、保存和分享。
現今數位相框螢幕尺寸從過去的3 吋進化到現在的7、8 吋、可以瀏覽與存放照片外，還有MP3 播放
、連結網路分享照片、使用觸控式面板降低使用難度等豐富實用的功能。國內許多業者紛紛在數位相
框這個領域下作進一步投資，可以看出數位相框是具有潛力和發展性的多媒體整合平台和數位家庭的 
媒體中心[30]。

Abstract. In this paper, we developed a digital auscultation system which pro-
vides a useful tool for users to measure the heart sounds and to see the wave-
form of sounds such as phonocardiogram. This system includes an ARM-based 
digital stethoscope with a USB port for data transmission and a PC-based 
graphic user interface for waveform and heart rate display and data recording. 
The functions of this digital stethoscope include play back, filtering, volume ad-
justment of sounds, and data transmission. Besides, the digital stethoscope can 
measure the sounds and then forward the data to the PC via the USB interface. 
On the PC, user can easy to see the waveform of sounds on the graphic user in-
terface. For heart sounds measurement, we also implemented a heart rate detec-
tion algorithm so that heart rate can also be shown on the graphic user interface. 
This system would be useful for aiding the auscultation diagnosis and telemedi-
cine applications.

1   Introduction 
Telemedicine is a rapidly developing application of clinical medicine where medical 
information is transferred through the Internet or other networks for the purpose of 
consulting, and sometimes remote medical procedures or examinations. Remote 
monitoring enables medical professionals to monitor a patient remotely using various 
technological devices. This method is primarily used for managing chronic diseases 
or specific conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or asthma. Stethoscope 
is one of important devices for examinations, which is used as a fundamental device 
for auscultation [1]. However, traditional stethoscope cannot satisfy telemedicine 
applications due to the sounds cannot be transmitted. Therefore, digital stethoscopes 
are used for the telemedicine applications [2].

Fig. 1. System architecture of the digital auscultation system 
1) Analog circuits: Microphone sensor receives the sound signals from the probe. 
A buffer is used to take this signal and then the output signal of buffer goes through a 
2-order high-pass filter, gain amplifier and a 2-order low-pass filter. Finally, the 
sound signals are sent to ARM platform and transformed into digital signal by the 
built-in ADC of STM32F103ZE, sampling rate is 8K Hz. The cut-off frequency of the 
high-pass filter is 20 Hz, and the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter is 2K Hz. 
Total gain is 30. After digital signal processing, the sound signals will be outputted by 
the built-in DAC of STM32F103ZE. The DAC output signal is sent to a 2-order low-
pass filter with 2K Hz cut-off frequency and then through a driver to drive a head-
phone or a speaker. 
2) ARM-based platform: We used the STM3210E-LK ARM-based platform, 
which is made by STMicroelectronics Company. It integrates a microcontroller 
STM32F103ZET6, one 128 64 dot-matrix LCD, one joy stick, buttons, UARTs, and 
USB peripherals. The STM32F103ZET6 is a high density ARM 32-bit microcontrol-
ler based on the Cortex-M3 core, with 512 Kbytes of embedded Flash memory, 64 
Kbytes of embedded SRAM and a rich set of on-chip peripherals, including 12-bit 
ADCs and DACs, GPIOs, UARTs and USB, et al..  
Fig. 2 shows the user’s operating interfaces on the ARM platform, including LCD 
display, joy stick, start/stop button and four different color LEDs which are used for 
display the status of frequency range selection. From left to right, the LED colors are 
blue, red, yellow and green separately. The initial screen is shown on this display, 
including current frequency range and volume.

Heart rate detection is finished on the program of PC. Fig. 4 shows this detection 
flow. The data of sounds received from the USB will first put into a data buffer. The 
data on the buffer are then sent to the audio interface of PC for sounds playing and the 
data also used for waveform display and heart rate detection. For heart rate detection, 
the data are first filtering by a 101-tap digital band-pass filter with cut-off frequency

3.3   Heart Rate Detection Results 
We compared our heart rate detection results with a commercial pulse oximeter. 
There are 4 people were tested, each person records 3 times and each time records 1 
min. We calculated the average of the 1 min heart rates for our method and the com-
mercial pulse oximeter. The range of all averaged heart rates is from 65.9 to 81.4 
bpm. The results show the average of the differences of the two methods is 0.3 bpm. 
The standard deviation (SD) of the difference of the two methods is 0.7 bpm. Table 2 
shows the results.

4   Discussion and Conclusion 
A prototype of a digital auscultation system is designed and implemented. This sys-
tem includes an ARM-based digital stethoscope with a USB port for data transmission 
and a PC-based GUI for waveform and heart rate display and data recording. Through 
digital signal processing, the stethoscope can select different frequency ranges for 
different kinds of sounds to obtain better effect for auscultation. Via the USB inter-
face, the data of sounds can be transmitted to other devices such as PC for broadcast 
to a remote server. Through the GUI on the PC, users can easy to see the waveform of 
sounds. For heart sounds measurement, we also implemented a heart rate detection 
algorithm so that heart rate can also be shown on the interface. This system would be 
useful for aiding the auscultation diagnosis and telemedicine applications. 
The used heart detection methods are easy to implement, so that they can easy to 
migrate to the ARM platform. However, there is several problems still need to be 
improved. Such as the heart rate detection is limited to 120 bpm now due to the Tth is 
a fixed value. We still need to improve this problem in the future to increase the range 
of heart rate detection. Besides, the motion artifacts will also cause false heart rate 
detections. Therefore, a robust heart rate detection method for the stethoscope is  
under studying. 
  
  
Abstract— In this paper, we developed a wireless blood 
pressure monitoring system which provides a useful tool for 
users to measure and manage their daily blood pressure values. 
This system includes an ARM-based blood pressure monitor 
with a ZigBee wireless transmission module and a PC-based 
management unit with graphic user interface and database. The 
wireless blood pressure monitor can measure the blood pressure 
and heart rate and then store and forward the measuring 
information to the management unit through the ZigBee 
wireless transmission. On the management unit, user can easy to 
see their blood pressure variation in the past using a line chart. 
Accuracy of blood pressure measurement has been verified by a 
commercial blood pressure simulator and shown the bias of 
systolic blood pressure is ≤ 1 mmHg and the bias of diastolic 
blood pressure is ≤ 1.4 mmHg.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
YPERTENSION is a critical risk factor for 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general 
population and reduction of blood pressure (BP) with 
effective antihypertensive therapy significantly decreases 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [1]. Keeping 
observing BP is also a matter of concern for those who have 
hypertension, coronary heart disease, or other cardiovascular 
diseases [2]. BP measurement is also important for particular 
disease patients, such as hemodialysis patients [3]. Hence, in 
the daily life, BP measurement and management is very 
useful for handling health situation and plays a preventive 
function. Many researches point out that the importance of 
BP measurement and management for elder and 
hypertensions [4]. Elderly people usually have higher BP, 
prone to take sick, and the morbidity of BP disease is higher. 
In patients with hypertension, BP measurement and 
management warn patients to take medicines and pay 
attention to diet, to get treatment effect. 
In recent years, homecare is becoming an important topic.

The market for automated BP measuring devices is growing 
rapidly. Home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) is 
becoming more and more popular [5]. The study of G. Bobrie 
and others [6] indicated that BP should systematically be 
measured at home in patients receiving treatment for 
hypertension. With the advances in technology and health 
awareness, many researchers use sensor and network 
technologies for home health monitoring system. In order to 
achieve monitoring of everywhere in home environment, J. H. 
Shin and others [7] used the non-invasive sensor to 
implement a homecare monitoring system for ECG and PPG 
monitoring, whether sleeping on the bed, sitting on sofa, and 
even in toilet. 
Physiological measurement using wireless transmission is 
becoming a trend. Y. Fang and others [8] used Bluetooth and 
GPRS technology to implement a real-time health 
information acquisition and alarm system. It is mainly used to 
detect the BP and pulse of the cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular disease patient, send the monitoring data to 
the information analyzing center by the aid of Bluetooth and 
mobile communication device. Compared with infrared and 
Bluetooth technology, ZigBee doesn’t have the advantages of 
transmission speed and efficiency. But it has some 
advantages with low power consumption, low cost and small 
size. ZigBee wireless transmission is gradually used in home 
automation, home security and personal healthcare treatment. 
Health monitoring system is also using ZigBee wireless data 
transmission [9]. We can see the future of ZigBee 
applications would be very promising. 
Traditionally, we have to record the data by ourselves 
when the measurement is completed. However, automatically 
data recording with PC or Laptop when the measurement is 
completed would be more convenient and can save human 
resources in home environment. With connecting to database, 
patients can record the past measuring results. Therefore, in 
this study, we combined a wireless BP monitor and database 
on PC or Laptop to store the measuring results. Users or 
doctors can see the past records on the graphic user interface 
(GUI) anytime, and the interface can show the line chart to 
express the BP variation. So it can be faster to see the health 
situation is abnormal or not. Users use the BP monitor which 
connects to database through the ZigBee wireless 
transmission has advantage of portable; they can manage 
their health anytime, anywhere. In home environment, 
patients with poor action can also easy to record every 
measurement result through the ZigBee wireless transmission. 
So it would provide a convenient health management 
environment at home.

3) ZigBee wireless transmission: In this paper, two 
ZigBee wireless transmission modules are used for the data 
transmission. This ZigBee module is based on a TI 
MSP430F1611 microcontroller and a UZ2400 low power 2.4 
GHz transceiver made by Uniband Electronic Corporation. 
UZ2400 is an IEEE802.15.4 compliant single-chip solution, 
integrates 2.4 GHz PHY, Baseband and MAC layer. UZ2400 
is controlled by the MSP430F1611 MCU through the serial 
peripheral interface bus (SPI) to apply in this wireless 
application. One ZigBee module is connected to ARM 
platform and another one is connected to management unit 
(PC/Laptop), and both of them are using the standard UART 
interface. The baud rate is set to 230.4kb/s. 
4) Management unit: The management unit is established 
on the PC or Laptop. An application program with GUI and 
MySQL database are implemented. This program is 
implemented by C# language. Through ZigBee wireless 
transmission module, the management unit can receive and 
record BP and HR values from the wireless BP monitor for 
every measurement. With this GUI, user can easy to trace 
their past measurement records. For long-term personal BP 
management, this management system can record every 
measurement result, and show a line chart to express the BP 
variation on a specific period, such as a week or a month. It is 
helpful to observe personal BP values variation. This BP 
measurement program lets user to store the data into the 
database and perform a BP management. Users and doctors 
are easily to know the BP statistics, and it can help to observe 
the treatment effects and save the treatment resources. 
B. Blood Pressure Measurement and Calibration Methods 
BP calculation is finished on the ARM platform, which 
uses the digital data transformed from the DC and AC signals 
of cuff pressure. According to the oscillometric method, the 
peak-to-peak value for each AC pulse should be detected 
during the deflation. We developed a simple 
threshold-comparing method to perform peak detection. The 
DC cuff pressure value on the position that has maximum 
peak-to-peak (Pmax) AC pulse is defined as the mean BP 
(MBP). Fig. 4 shows the peak detection results for each AC 
pulse and the DC and AC waveforms of cuff pressure in once 
measurement.  
A Fluke CuffLink non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) 
simulator is used to verify and calibrate the measuring results 
in this paper. The CuffLink simulator offers a quick, reliable, 
and consistent way to evaluate the operation and performance 
of oscillometric NIBP signals. With user-programmable 
selections, the CuffLink will simulate the full range or normal, 
hypertensive, and hypotensive dynamic NIBP waveforms. 
According to our test results, we got the SBP value is 
corresponding to the position that the peak-to-peak value of 
AC pulse is around 0.45 Pmax, and the DBP value is 
corresponding to the position that the peak-to-peak value of 
AC pulse is around 0.75 Pmax. Fig. 4 also demonstrates the 
detected results.

In Fig. 5, except the SBP, DBP and HR are shown on the 
LCD display of ARM platform. The green LED is also 
lighting to indicate normal BP. User is easier to understand 
their BP situation via the LED colors. 
B. GUI on the Management Unit 
Fig. 6 shows the GUI on the management unit. There are 
four main functions on this GUI: 
1) Query: For user to perform database query. When they 
select one of IDs, they can see this ID’s past measuring 
information. For example, the table on the right hand side of 
Fig. 6. The information includes SBP, DBP, and HR for each 
measuring time. On the left hand side, the line charts for the 
SBP, DBP, and HR are also shown. The variation of these 
parameters can clear to display. 
2) UART setting: For setting the UART communication 
protocol of the ZigBee wireless transmission module. 
3) Data export: The data of database can be exported and 
saved as a text file format. 
4) Data import: The data of database can be imported 
from a saved file. 
C. Blood Pressure Measuring Results 
TABLE II shows the measuring results. We measured four 
kinds of pressure values from CuffLink; each pressure value 
has been measured 5 times. The results show the bias of SBP 
is ≤ 1 mmHg, precision of SBP is ≤ 1.643 mmHg and the bias 
of DBP is ≤ 1.4 mmHg, precision of DBP is ≤ 1.788 mmHg. 
The bias is the average of the differences between the 
CuffLink and our measuring results, and the precision is the 
standard deviation of the differences between CuffLink and 
our measuring results.

Abstract— In this paper, we developed a wireless blood 
pressure monitoring system which provides a useful tool for 
users to measure and manage their daily blood pressure values. 
This system includes an ARM-based blood pressure monitor 
with a ZigBee wireless transmission module and a PC-based 
management unit with graphic user interface and database. The 
wireless blood pressure monitor can measure the blood pressure 
and heart rate and then store and forward the measuring 
information to the management unit through the ZigBee 
wireless transmission. On the management unit, user can easy to 
see their blood pressure variation in the past using a line chart. 
Accuracy of blood pressure measurement has been verified by a 
commercial blood pressure simulator and shown the bias of 
systolic blood pressure is ≤ 1 mmHg and the bias of diastolic 
blood pressure is ≤ 1.4 mmHg.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
YPERTENSION is a critical risk factor for 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general 
population and reduction of blood pressure (BP) with 
effective antihypertensive therapy significantly decreases 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [1]. Keeping 
observing BP is also a matter of concern for those who have 
hypertension, coronary heart disease, or other cardiovascular 
diseases [2]. BP measurement is also important for particular 
disease patients, such as hemodialysis patients [3]. Hence, in 
the daily life, BP measurement and management is very 
useful for handling health situation and plays a preventive 
function. Many researches point out that the importance of 
BP measurement and management for elder and 
hypertensions [4]. Elderly people usually have higher BP, 
prone to take sick, and the morbidity of BP disease is higher. 
In patients with hypertension, BP measurement and 
management warn patients to take medicines and pay 
attention to diet, to get treatment effect. 
In recent years, homecare is becoming an important topic.

The market for automated BP measuring devices is growing 
rapidly. Home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) is 
becoming more and more popular [5]. The study of G. Bobrie 
and others [6] indicated that BP should systematically be 
measured at home in patients receiving treatment for 
hypertension. With the advances in technology and health 
awareness, many researchers use sensor and network 
technologies for home health monitoring system. In order to 
achieve monitoring of everywhere in home environment, J. H. 
Shin and others [7] used the non-invasive sensor to 
implement a homecare monitoring system for ECG and PPG 
monitoring, whether sleeping on the bed, sitting on sofa, and 
even in toilet. 
Physiological measurement using wireless transmission is 
becoming a trend. Y. Fang and others [8] used Bluetooth and 
GPRS technology to implement a real-time health 
information acquisition and alarm system. It is mainly used to 
detect the BP and pulse of the cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular disease patient, send the monitoring data to 
the information analyzing center by the aid of Bluetooth and 
mobile communication device. Compared with infrared and 
Bluetooth technology, ZigBee doesn’t have the advantages of 
transmission speed and efficiency. But it has some 
advantages with low power consumption, low cost and small 
size. ZigBee wireless transmission is gradually used in home 
automation, home security and personal healthcare treatment. 
Health monitoring system is also using ZigBee wireless data 
transmission [9]. We can see the future of ZigBee 
applications would be very promising. 
Traditionally, we have to record the data by ourselves 
when the measurement is completed. However, automatically 
data recording with PC or Laptop when the measurement is 
completed would be more convenient and can save human 
resources in home environment. With connecting to database, 
patients can record the past measuring results. Therefore, in 
this study, we combined a wireless BP monitor and database 
on PC or Laptop to store the measuring results. Users or 
doctors can see the past records on the graphic user interface 
(GUI) anytime, and the interface can show the line chart to 
express the BP variation. So it can be faster to see the health 
situation is abnormal or not. Users use the BP monitor which 
connects to database through the ZigBee wireless 
transmission has advantage of portable; they can manage 
their health anytime, anywhere. In home environment, 
patients with poor action can also easy to record every 
measurement result through the ZigBee wireless transmission. 
So it would provide a convenient health management 
environment at home.

3) ZigBee wireless transmission: In this paper, two 
ZigBee wireless transmission modules are used for the data 
transmission. This ZigBee module is based on a TI 
MSP430F1611 microcontroller and a UZ2400 low power 2.4 
GHz transceiver made by Uniband Electronic Corporation. 
UZ2400 is an IEEE802.15.4 compliant single-chip solution, 
integrates 2.4 GHz PHY, Baseband and MAC layer. UZ2400 
is controlled by the MSP430F1611 MCU through the serial 
peripheral interface bus (SPI) to apply in this wireless 
application. One ZigBee module is connected to ARM 
platform and another one is connected to management unit 
(PC/Laptop), and both of them are using the standard UART 
interface. The baud rate is set to 230.4kb/s. 
4) Management unit: The management unit is established 
on the PC or Laptop. An application program with GUI and 
MySQL database are implemented. This program is 
implemented by C# language. Through ZigBee wireless 
transmission module, the management unit can receive and 
record BP and HR values from the wireless BP monitor for 
every measurement. With this GUI, user can easy to trace 
their past measurement records. For long-term personal BP 
management, this management system can record every 
measurement result, and show a line chart to express the BP 
variation on a specific period, such as a week or a month. It is 
helpful to observe personal BP values variation. This BP 
measurement program lets user to store the data into the 
database and perform a BP management. Users and doctors 
are easily to know the BP statistics, and it can help to observe 
the treatment effects and save the treatment resources. 
B. Blood Pressure Measurement and Calibration Methods 
BP calculation is finished on the ARM platform, which 
uses the digital data transformed from the DC and AC signals 
of cuff pressure. According to the oscillometric method, the 
peak-to-peak value for each AC pulse should be detected 
during the deflation. We developed a simple 
threshold-comparing method to perform peak detection. The 
DC cuff pressure value on the position that has maximum 
peak-to-peak (Pmax) AC pulse is defined as the mean BP 
(MBP). Fig. 4 shows the peak detection results for each AC 
pulse and the DC and AC waveforms of cuff pressure in once 
measurement.  
A Fluke CuffLink non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) 
simulator is used to verify and calibrate the measuring results 
in this paper. The CuffLink simulator offers a quick, reliable, 
and consistent way to evaluate the operation and performance 
of oscillometric NIBP signals. With user-programmable 
selections, the CuffLink will simulate the full range or normal, 
hypertensive, and hypotensive dynamic NIBP waveforms. 
According to our test results, we got the SBP value is 
corresponding to the position that the peak-to-peak value of 
AC pulse is around 0.45 Pmax, and the DBP value is 
corresponding to the position that the peak-to-peak value of 
AC pulse is around 0.75 Pmax. Fig. 4 also demonstrates the 
detected results.

III. RESULTS 
A. Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor 
In Fig. 5, except the SBP, DBP and HR are shown on the 
LCD display of ARM platform. The green LED is also 
lighting to indicate normal BP. User is easier to understand 
their BP situation via the LED colors. 
B. GUI on the Management Unit 
Fig. 6 shows the GUI on the management unit. There are 
four main functions on this GUI: 
1) Query: For user to perform database query. When they 
select one of IDs, they can see this ID’s past measuring 
information. For example, the table on the right hand side of 
Fig. 6. The information includes SBP, DBP, and HR for each 
measuring time. On the left hand side, the line charts for the 
SBP, DBP, and HR are also shown. The variation of these 
parameters can clear to display. 
2) UART setting: For setting the UART communication 
protocol of the ZigBee wireless transmission module. 
3) Data export: The data of database can be exported and 
saved as a text file format. 
4) Data import: The data of database can be imported 
from a saved file. 
C. Blood Pressure Measuring Results 
TABLE II shows the measuring results. We measured four 
kinds of pressure values from CuffLink; each pressure value 
has been measured 5 times. The results show the bias of SBP 
is ≤ 1 mmHg, precision of SBP is ≤ 1.643 mmHg and the bias 
of DBP is ≤ 1.4 mmHg, precision of DBP is ≤ 1.788 mmHg. 
The bias is the average of the differences between the 
CuffLink and our measuring results, and the precision is the 
standard deviation of the differences between CuffLink and 
our measuring results.
