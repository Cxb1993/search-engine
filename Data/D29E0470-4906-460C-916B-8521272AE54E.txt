Abstract—A new constant current driver circuit technology 
for light-emitting diode (LED) is proposed in this paper. A 
low dropout linear regulator (LDO) is used to provide a stable 
and low voltage for the driver circuit. Gain boosting 
technique is used to enhance the power supply rejection ratio 
(PSRR) of the driver circuit. A simple and effective spread 
spectrum pulse width modulation signal is generated to 
greatly reduce the electromagnetic interference (EMI) of the 
dimming control circuit.  To keep the driving current to be 
stable the driving circuit is designed to be voltage and 
temperature insensitive. For applied voltage changes from 1.4 
V to 3.8 V, the measured driving current has only 0.2% 
variation. The temperature variation of the driving current is 
142 ppm/°C . The chip is implemented in TSMC 0.35um 
Mixed-signal 2P4M process. The overall chip area is 
21.02 0.91mm .

I. INTRODUCTION 
ED drivers are stand-alone control circuitry or a 
self-contained power supply with control circuit that 
provides an output to match the electrical characteristics 
of LEDs to be controlled [1]. These drivers  provide constant 
current and/or constant voltage to maintain a constant 
luminous output to an array of LED’s configured in a 
designed pattern. In order to improve the life span of the back 
light module of the liquid crystal display (LCD), low-cost and 
high reliability are the major considerations. To improve the 
color space, the present trend is to use the advanced 
technology of RGB dynamic LED back light. In this 
technology, the basic LED cell uses one red, two green and 
one blue (RGB) LEDs to produce color spectrum larger than 
not only the NTSC color space but also CCFL [1]. With this 
technology, images can be made to look more natural. 
Additionally, conventional white backlighting which does 
not employ RGB dynamic technique cannot render a sense of 
depth [2]. 
LED drivers are based on a current-mirror architecture that 
transfers a reference current produced at the external resistors 
to each of the multiple current output channels. Fig. 1 shows 
the architecture of a conventional linear current-regulator [3]. 
Normally, the implementation of the resistor R in the emitter 
is implemented off-chip and sometimes within the chip. To 
alleviate the problem on chip size, a practical method would 
be to implement the resistor with an on-chip NMOS which

(CIC) of Taiwan and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 
Limited (TSMC).  
operates in linear region. A general light-emitting diode 
driving circuit architecture shown in Fig. 2 provides constant 
currents to drive light emitting diodes.  Meanwhile a reliable 
mechanism is dependent on the channel feedback signal. 
One of the methods of modifying the resistance in the 
emitter is the use of multi-resistance with feedback [4] which 
computes the average error to compensate for the voltage loss 
and obtain accurate constant current to increase accuracy. 
Another method is implemented in literature [5], which uses a 
typical current error to achieve low-cost performance. The 
application of level-shift circuit and trimmable n-well resistor 
is introduced in literature [6] to respond to temperature 
variation. An improve method of modifying the resistance in 
the emitter is presented in [7]. In this article, the utilization of 
reference current technique with proper ratio to fine-tune the 
resistance in the emitter is emphasized and the MOS 
transistor is biased in zero temperature coefficient regions to 
achieve temperature compensation. In addition, since CMOS 
current reference is dependent on supply voltage and

Iref is using the two NMOS transistor has the same 
temperature coefficient of mobility as shown in equation (7) 
and can be simplified in the equation (8), which can be 
temperature independent due to the two nmos temperature

  The change in RP and voltage Vref1 determines the 
variation in the ratio which the RP and Vref1 has same 
temperature variation. Also, these variations tend to cancel 
out each other producing a net variation which is almost 
constant with temperature.

C. Dimming Circuit 
Research of high efficiency power systems are more and 
more important, nevertheless the critical issues by 
electromagnetic interference (EMI) are escalated. Owing to 
heavy harmonics brought by high frequency constant 
switching result to a serious EMI problems. Signals delivered 
at high speed that makes short rising time would cause poor 
EMI of the IC’s making EMI issue inside the IC to be more 
unpleasant. Thus, studies on how to reduce EMI on power 
system become more cautious. Fig. 7 shows the Dimming 
circuit, by the charge and discharge circuit can be deduced, by 
the available frequency bandwidth of the last exhibition as 
represented by equation (9)

IV. CONCLUSION 
This paper proposes a new circuit for obtaining a constant 
current in parallel LED (Light Emitting Diodes) strings. Also, 
it recommends a new circuit for constant current on the 
temperature and applied voltage with low sensitivity. When 
the proposed circuit is applied to LED backlighting and LED 
display, it can provide more than 20mA of current due to the 
single external resistor in the emitter. Moreover, presently, 
the compensation in the manufacturing process has caused 
this circuit to achieve less than 3.85% of the change in 
temperature compensation and is almost equivalent to 
142ppm. The circuit has been fabricated in a CMOS 0.35-μm 
standard process. A 142 ppm/°C CMOS current reference, 
which is widely ranges from -40~120/°C. Here, by using only 
one resistor the quantity of component is reduced. Finally, 
current error percentage of the current balance circuit is less 
than 0.07% with forward voltage variation at 2V and the area 
is 0.923 mm2 with core area of  0.106 mm2.

 produced is now compared to a sawtooth waveform 
determined by sawtooth generator. The comparator outputs a 
digital output of PWM that operates and control the power 
switch. In order to improve the conversion efficiency of 
PWM, fixed frequency is used [4]. When the circuit output 
voltage, Vout changes, Verror also changes and thus causes the 
comparator threshold to change. Consequently, the output 
pulse width (PWM) also changes significantly.

the feedback regulates the output voltage. The feedback

RR
R is being compared to the 
reference voltage, Vref so that the error amplifier will 
generate the error voltage, Verror. Through the pulse 
modulator, the output voltage of Verror is compared to the 
sawtooth waveform and the pulse width modulated voltage, 
Vcontrol is being generated to control the transistor of the 
boost converter.  
B.  LED Driver 
LED current regulator is simply a current mirror 
topology [6], which copies a current as a typical current 
mirror. In this structure, the drain voltages of the mirror 
transistors (M1~M2) are sensed and amplified the difference 
by OP and its output provides the gate voltage for transistor 
M3 such that it is biased in saturation region. This 
architecture forces Vds1=Vds2, thus improving the accuracy of 
the copy current [7].  
According to [8], there are two conventional techniques 
in driving LEDs, these are Amplitude Mode and Pulse Width 
Modulation Mode.  
For amplitude mode driving technique also known as 
analog dimming, depicted in Fig. 4(a), a constant forward 
current must be maintained or adjusted in order the have a 
constant and stable luminous intensity and  color.  The PWM 
 
method of dimming is the actual ON and OFF of the LED 
current for short period of time. As Fig. 4(b) shows, the 
dimming of the LED is constant and becomes proportional to 
the duty cycle of the dimming waveform. By varying the 
duty cycle, the stability of brightness and luminosity highly 
depends on the accuracy of the peak current level and its 
duty cycle. Furthermore, by pulsing the LED with current, 
and varying the duty cycle of the current waveform, a rapid 
transition occur between on and off, and the relative times 
spent give the impression of being dimmed. 
III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
The integration of the design circuit is composed of two 
parts.  
Firstly, a unique aspect of power converter, a PWM boost 
converter, used to convert Li-ion battery (2.7V~4.2V) to 
maintain a tightly regulated dc voltage of 5V. 
Secondly, a constant current regulator is used to regulate 
a constant current through each LED string. Also, it is used 
to maintain a constant current level in its respective lighting 
system. This current regulator is equipped with brightness or 
the dimming control. Dimming control adjusts the brightness 
of LEDs for the visibility compensation. 
A. PWM Boost Converter 
The freewheeling diode is replaced with a PMOS 
transistor which is known as synchronous rectifier which can 
offer a higher efficiency particularly in low voltage such as 
portable devices. The internal structure of the boost regulator 
majorly include: soft-start circuitry, the maximum power 
supply selection circuit, inductor current sensing circuit, zero 
current detection circuit with non-overlapping conduction 
circuit, and PWM modulator circuit.  
Soft start has the capability to control the duty cycle of 
the switching transistor during power on. Using two-stage 
soft start design will effectively inhibits the converter from 
inrush currents during power on. The first stage includes the 
pre-charge circuit used to turn off the power transistor Q1 
and enables Q2 to stabilize the charge current to the output 
terminal to minimize large current that may cause damage to 
internal circuitry. When the output voltage approaches the 
input voltage value, the inductor current will be stabilized 
and thus a second stage soft start is performed. 
Consider Fig. 5, the gradual increased of PWM signal is 
obtained by comparing the ramp signal with the sawtooth 
signal produced by the circuit, the gradually increased  pulse 
width  signal  drives   Q1   and   the  output voltage also

V. CONCLUSION 
In this thesis, it completes the design of a multi channel 
constant current with integrated boost regulator. It is 
composed of a voltage mode synchronous boost power stage 
with on-chip compensation and a constant current source 
regulator with PWM dimming control which achieve a 
constant current used to drive LED string. 
The technique of the integration offers a small chip size 
area of 2.2799671 × 2.39105 mm2. The design can have an 
input range of 2.7V to 4.2V which make the device 
applicable for two battery powered application. It is 
implemented with parallel channel output with two series 
LEDs in each channel. The simulation results posses an 
output constant current and maintains an accurate constant 
current greater than 20mA, thus achieving high efficiency of 
85%. 
Table 1 shows the comparison table that compares the 
work of this research study with the other existing works out 
in the market. The simulation performance of this work is 
not far behind with respect to the data gathered particularly 
to the efficiency of the constant current used to drive the 
LED string.
