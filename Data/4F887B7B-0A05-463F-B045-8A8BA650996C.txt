In this study, the microwave dielectric properties of CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramics have been investigated. CuO
was selected as liquid sintering aids to lower the sintering temperature of CaLa4Ti5O17. It is found that
the X-ray diffraction pattern exhibited no phase difference with 0.5wt.% CuO additive at different sin-
tering temperatures. A maximum value of dielectric constant of 57, a maximum value of quality factor
multiplies resonant frequency (Q× f) of 9000GHz, and a temperature coefﬁcient of resonant frequency
(f =−10ppm/◦C) can be obtained with 0.5wt.% CuO additive and sintered at 1450 ◦C for 4h. A near-zero
temperature coefﬁcient of resonant frequency (f =−4.9ppm/◦C) wasmeasured for CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramics
with 1.0wt.% CuO sintered at 1350 ◦C for 4h.

1. Introduction
The applications of microwave ceramics in mobile communi-
cations, such as resonators, ﬁlters and antennas, have been rapidly
increasing in the last decade.Many researcheshavebeen focusedon
developing good microwave dielectric materials to achieve device
miniaturization and system stability. Three dielectric properties
must be considered formaterials used inmicrowave devices: a high
dielectric constant, a high quality factor, and a near-zero temper-
ature coefﬁcient of resonant frequency are required for the small
size, low loss, and high temperature stability, respectively [1,2]. The
microwavedielectric properties of the (Ba,La)nTin−1O3n (n=5and6)
havealreadybeenreported.BaLa4Ti4O15 andBa2La4Ti5O18 are char-
acterized by a high dielectric constant (εr ∼39–46), a high quality
factor multiplies resonant frequency (Q× f∼12,000–31,839), and
a small temperature coefﬁcient of resonant frequency (f ∼−36 to
79ppm/◦C) [3–5]. The homologous compounds ALa4Ti4O15 (A=Ba,
Sr and Ca) are candidate materials for dielectric resonators with
high dielectric constant and quality factor. The Ba-analogy, Ca-
analogy, and Sr-analogy showed highest dielectric constant, quality
factor, andnear-zero temperature coefﬁcient of resonant frequency,
respectively [6,7]. The dielectric constant and the temperature
coefﬁcient of resonant frequency of both (Ba1−xSrx)La4Ti4O15 and

(Ba1−xCax)La4Ti4O15 ceramics, ranging from 45 to 49 and −3
to −10ppm/◦C [8]. MO–La2O3–TiO2 (M=Ca, Sr and Ba) is well
known as a microwave material for dielectric resonators and ﬁl-
ters. Most of these ceramics combine a high dielectric constant
(εr ∼42–54), a high quality factor multiplies resonant frequency
(Q× f∼16,222–50,215), and an adjustable temperature coefﬁcient
of resonant frequency (f ∼−25 to 6ppm/◦C). Among the inves-
tigated orthorhombic phases, CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramic sintered at
1625 ◦C gives dielectric constant ∼53.7, quality factor multiplies
resonant frequency ∼17,359GHz, and temperature coefﬁcient of
resonant frequency∼−20ppm/◦C [9].With the partial replacement
of Ca with Zn, the dielectric properties of CaLa4Ti5O17 ceram-
ics at microwave frequency are modiﬁed. A maximum dielectric
constant of 57, a maximum quality factor multiplies resonant fre-
quency of 15000GHz, and a near-zero temperature coefﬁcient
of resonant frequency (f) of −8.16ppm/◦C were obtained for
Ca0.99Zn0.01La4Ti5O17 ceramics with 0.5wt.% CuO additive sintered
at 1450 ◦C for 4h [10].
On the basis of these results, investigations of CaLa4Ti5O17
ceramic systems by adding CuO have been carried out to produce
materials with better microwave dielectric properties for applica-
tion in microwave devices. The microwave dielectric properties of
the CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramic system have been found to differ with
different amounts of CuO added and sintering temperatures. For
furtherunderstandingof thesedifferentmicrowavedielectric prop-
erties, they were analyzed on the basis of densiﬁcation, X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns, and observation of microstructures.

dense, and grains did not grow after it was sintered at 1350 ◦C.
Comparing the microstructures of CaLa4Ti5O17 with 0.5wt.% CuO
additives sintered at different temperatures, the number of pores
decreased and the rate of grain growth increased apparently. The
pores almost disappeared in the specimen sintered at 1450 ◦C. In
order to identify the compositions of round-like and rod-like grains,
an energy-disperse spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was employed on
the round-like and rod-like grains. According to the quantitative
analysis as shown in Table 1, it was suggested that where the grains
in round-like or in rod-like are CaLa4Ti5O17.
The apparent densities of CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramics with different
amounts of CuO additive after sintering from 1350 to 1500 ◦C for
4h are as shown in Fig. 3. The bulk density was found to increase
to a maximum value when sintered at 1450 ◦Cwhen the amount of
CuO additive was 0.5wt.%, and thereafter decreased. The bulk den-
sity increase with increasing sintering temperature may be due to
the decrease in the number of pores as shown in Fig. 2, while the
decrease in bulk density might be due to abnormal grain growth. A
maximum density of 5.32g/cm3, corresponding to a relative theo-
retical density of 98%, was obtained for CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramics with
0.5wt.% CuO sintered at 1450 ◦C for 4h. Moreover, samples with
CuO possessed a much higher density than undoped ones with the
same sintering condition as shown in Table 2. This implies that
CuO additives can effectively lower the sintering temperature of
CaLa4Ti5O17.

atures for 4h. The relationship between the dielectric constant and
the sintering temperature revealed the same trend as that between
the apparent density and the sintering temperature. After reach-
ing a maximum at 1450 ◦C, the dielectric constant decreased when
the amount of CuO additive was 0.5wt.%. The dielectric constant
decreased from 57 to 54 at approximately 6.0GHz as the amount of
CuO additive increased 0.5–1.0wt.% when the ceramics were sin-
tered at 1450 ◦C. Amaximumdielectric constant of 57was obtained
for CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramics with 0.5wt.% CuO additive sintered at
1450 ◦C for4h.However, toohigha sintering temperatureat1500 ◦C
would cause in a decrease in dielectric constant. The decrease in
dielectric constant was caused by the low densities of the ceram-
ics. Since lower density leads to higher porosity, thus, resulted in
a lower dielectric constant. The results suggest that CuO additives
could effectively reduce the sintering temperature of CaLa4Ti5O17,
as illustrated in Table 2.
The quality factor multiplies resonant frequency (Q× f) of
CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramics with different amounts of CuO additive sin-
tered at different temperatures for 4h are shown in Fig. 4. The
relationship between the quality factor multiplies resonant fre-
quency and the sintering temperature revealed the same trend as
that between the apparent density and the sintering temperature.
With increasing sintering temperature, the quality factormultiplies
resonant frequency increased to a maximum value and there-
after decreased. The quality factor multiplies resonant frequency
decreased from 9000 to 8500GHz as the amount of CuO addi-
tive increased 0.5–1.0wt.% sintered at 1450 ◦C. A maximum quality
factor multiplies resonant frequency of 9000GHz was obtained
for CaLa4Ti5O17 ceramics with 0.5wt.% CuO sintered at 1450 ◦C
for 4h. This is caused by the microwave dielectric loss, which is
affected by many factors that can be divided into intrinsic and the
extrinsic losses. The intrinsic loss is caused by the lattice vibra-
tional modes. The extrinsic loss is induced by the density, pores,
the second phases, the impurities, the oxygen vacancy, the grain
size and the lattice defects [14,15]. Because the Q× f of CaLa4Ti5O17
was consistent with variation of apparent density, it is suggested
that the quality factormultiplies resonant frequency of CaLa4Ti5O17
is mainly controlled by the apparent density. These results again
suggest that CuO additives could effectively reduce the sintering
temperature of CaLa4Ti5O17, as illustrated in Table 2. On the other
hand, the dielectric constant and loss factor in our study exhibit
some difference from the measurements in Ref. [7]. It is inferred
that the difference has been made is form the starting raw chemi-
cals.

Abstract—In this paper, the measurement results of 
high-permittivity dielectric resonator antenna have been 
presented.  With this technique, a 6.2% bandwidth (return loss < 
-10 dB) of center frequency at about 3.55 GHz for application in 
WiMAX has successfully been achieved.  The co-polarization 
radiation is strongest at ≅θ 20O from the broadside in the 
E-plane.  The antenna has a 3 dB beam angle of about 75O.  Peak 
antenna gain is about 5.72 dBi, with gain variations less than 2.0 
dBi for frequencies within in the -10 dB S11 bandwidth.
