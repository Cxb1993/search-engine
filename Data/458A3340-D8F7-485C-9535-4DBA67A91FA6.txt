I.  INTRODUCTION 
High-performance nonvolatile memory 
(NVM) devices with a polycrystalline 
silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) 
structure have been demonstrated [1].  
However, the conventional thin films as 
charge trapping layers (CTLs) of the SONOS 
devices need to overcome the problems of the 
charge loss due to a local leakage path [2].  
In addition, the metal gate and 
high-dielectric-constant (high-k) gate oxides 
with equivalent-oxide thickness (EOT) have 
been widely used to supersede the tunneling 
oxide of the silicon dioxide (SiO2) for 
reducing gate leakage current [3-6].  
Recently, several approaches related to 
nanoparticles (NPs) as CTLs have been 
achieved such as Si, Ge, Au, Pt, NiSi2, W, TiN, 
Ni, and Al2O3 NPs [2, 7-14].  The flatband 
voltage shift of 600 mV is obtained in 
self-organized Ge NPs embedded in the 
hafnium aluminum oxide (HfAlO) fabricated 
by pulsed deposition [7].  The average size 
and the density of the NiSi2 NPs are measured 
to be ~7.6 nm and 3.3 x 1011 cm-2, respectively 
[10].  Well-isolated tungsten NPs with an 
mean diameter of 5 nm and a surface density 
of 5 x 1011 cm-2 are also obtained by the 
tungsten NPs embedded in the HfAlO high-k 
dielectrics [11].  Since CNTs exhibit many 
unique properties, including high thermal 
conductivity, mechanical strength, and current 
carrying ability, the CNTs embedded in the 
high-k gate dielectric would be an attractive 
technology option for the NVM devices 
applications.  Although various NPs as CTLs 
of the SONOS devices have been reported, the 
physical and reliability properties of the 
SONOS devices with CNTs deposited on the 
high-k dielectrics surfaces are not yet clear.  
In this letter, the CNTs embedded in the 
hafnium oxynitride (HfON) high-k dielectrics 
have been developed by means of the 
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.  
 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
A Al/HfON/CNTN/HfON stack structure 
was formed on a (100)-oriented p-type silicon 
substrates for the MOS capacitors fabrication.  
Prior to HfON growth, all wafers were 
cleaned with a wet cleaning process 
[APM(=NH4OH/H2O2/H2O)/HPM(=HCl/H2O
2/H2O)/ DHF(=HF/H2O)].  Then, the Hf 
layers with 4.0 nm thicknesses measured by 
the spectroscopic ellipsometry were thermally 
evaporated on the cleaned wafers.  A 
post-deposition anneal (PDA) using furnace 
was then carried out at 600 ℃ in N2 gas for 5 
min to form HfOxNy.  An EOT of 1.8 nm 
was extracted by comparing the measured data 
at 1 MHz with the simulated low-frequency 
C-V data by the simulation program [15].  
Notably, some oxygen in the form of HfOxNy 
may already exist during the Hf evaporation.  
To avoid excessive oxidation that might cause 
the formation of thick interfacial layer 
between Si and high-k dielectric, PDA was 
only performed in a N2 ambient with a trace 
amount of residual oxygen in both chamber 
and native oxide of Si surface.  Next, a Co 
acetate [(CH3CO2)2Co-4H2O] and a Mo 
acetate [(CH3COOH)2Mo] (Co:Mo= 
Furthermore, to estimate the charge trap states 
densities of the CNTN, the following equation 
was adopted: N=(Ceff/qA)∆Vfb, where Ceff is 
the capacitance of the MOS devices with the 
HfON/CNTNs/HfON stack dielectric, q is the 
electronic charge and equal to 1.6 x 10-19 C, A 
is the area of the MOS devices, and ∆Vfb is 
the flatband voltage shift due to hysteresis 
sweep.  For the MOS devices with Ceff=350 
pF , A=0.001256 cm2, and ∆Vfb=1 V, the 
charge trap states density is estimated to be 
around 1.74 x 1012 cm-2 during the C-V 
hysteresis sweep at ±10 V.

Fig. 3. The typical capacitance-voltage (C-V) 
hysteresis characteristics of the memory 
devices with CNTN as charge trapping layer 
were obtained.  The C-V sweep loops 
included ±3, ±5, and ±10 V.   
Further programming properties of the 
MOS devices with the CNTNs under various 
programming times were shown in Fig. 4.  
After a +10 V biased voltage with various 
programming times, all C-V curves were 
measured from +3 to -3 V.  The results 
suggest that the flatband voltage has little shift 
to left with the increase of the programming 
times for the electrons injection condition, 
indicating that the electrons are difficult to be 
written into the CNTNs.  On the contrary, 
with increasing the programming times, a 
clear shift to the left can be observed for a 
negative programming voltage of -10 V, 
suggesting that the holes are much easier to be 
written into the CNTNs.  The trapping 
mechanism related to the holes trapping is 
consistent with the results examined at Fig. 3.
