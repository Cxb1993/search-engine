Abstract 
According to the computer is more and more powerful, the computer animation is applied in the 
game, entertainment, and scientific fields. When making a CG animation, we may build 
three-dimensional models, and then attach the motion on these models. For getting the motion data, 
either the key framing setup or the motion capture systems need complex setup and considerable 
work, and cost expensive. Thus, the motion data is valuable media, and need the copyright 
protection. In this proposal, we’ll develop the digital watermarking technology for the motion data. 
Some characteristics of the motion data are different from those of other media, namely, the 
physical feature of a articulated link model should be maintained. The requirement of 
imperceptibility in watermarking motion data is higher than in other watermarking applications. For 
considering both the time continuous varying of one joint and synchronous between all joints, we 
adopted the singular value decomposition to resolve the multi- variants problem. For testing the 
robustness, some signal processing of motion data has been used in our system.

摘要 
隨著電腦運算速度的提昇，在電腦遊戲、影視娛樂及科學應用等各方面，三維電腦動畫的應
用愈來愈普及。在製作電腦動畫的過程，除了基本的三維模型建構外，就是要賦予這些模型
動作。而不管是手調關鍵影格，或是使用動作捕捉系統，運動資料取得過程需要繁複的設定
及大量的工作，代價昂貴。因而，製作而得的運動資料屬於有價媒體，需要受到著作權的保
護。本研究希望發展運動資料的數位浮水印技術，以作運動資料的版權保護。而關節運動的
物理特性必須維持，這使得浮水印的不可察覺性要求比一般的訊號資料要許多。為同時考慮
一關節訊號在時間軸的連續特性，及不同關節間的同步關係，我們將用多變數資料常用的奇
異值分解(singular value decomposition)。在本研究中，我們提出一個新穎且具強韌性的運動資
料之數位浮水印技術，並使用一般的運動資料訊號處理進行攻擊測試，以驗證所提方法之強
韌性(robustness)。

2.2. Singular Value Decomposition 
The matrix of motion data has two relations in it: one is the spatial (row) correlation among 
different parameters of joints; the other is the temporal (column) relation among frames. One 
popular tool for the analysis of high-dimensional data is Singular Value Decomposition. It 
decomposes an m-by-n matrix X into three matrices: the left eigenvector matrix U, the eigenvalue 
matrix S and the right eigenvector matrix V. See the following equations.  
Figure 2 shows a motion matrix X and its 1st, 2nd and 3rd component matrices, where the x-axis 
represents the frame numbers, the y-axis represents the normalized values of joint parameters, and 
each curve is one parameter.

and the 3rd component matrix 
 
3. Watermark Embedding and Detection 
3.1. Watermark Generation 
The owner of the motion data protects his (or her) ownership by embedding a watermark in the 
motion data. When he (or she) find somebody else using his (or her) data illegally, he (or she) can 
extract the watermark to claim his (or her) ownership. In most time, the watermark should be a 
meaningful message representing the owner. In the other way, the counterfeit problem should also 
be noted, i.e. somebody embeds another himself watermark to the watermarked data and claims that 
he is the owner. Thus, we generate the watermark W by hashing the meaningful key K f the owner,

noise perturbing. We smooth the watermarking data with a 3-tap average filter.

5. Conclusion and Future Work 
In this report, we proposed a novel approach for watermarking the motion data. The matrix of the 
motion data is transformed to the SVD representation, then embedded watermark in the singular 
values. The experimental results show that this approach is resist to various attacks. However, the 
SVD-based watermarking strategy has the problem of high false-positive probability. In the future, 
we’ll combine other strategy into the embedding process to resolve this problem.
