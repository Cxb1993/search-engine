1. 部落格網路 
 
圖二 部落格網路 
 
在我們的部落格網路中，我們將部落格間關係大
致上分為兩種：（1）Support關係及（2）Similarity
關係，在我們的部落格網路中，我們分別以Support 
Edge及Similarity Edge代表，如圖二所示。 
我們將經由comment，trackback及blogroll等關
係所產生的邊通稱為Support Edge，而Similarity 
Edge指得是當兩個部落格內含有相同的超連結，我們
認為他們在某個領域上是相關的，我們額外給他們之
間一個新的雙向連結。 
 
2. BRank 
我們的Brank演算法是基於PageRank演算法而
衍生出來的一種適用於部落格環境下的連結分析演
算法，如表格一所示。

至於部落格A到部落格B的關係分數會被三種因
素所決定，分述如下： 
i. WRtype 表示相對應的部落格關係的種類。 
ii. RNRtype 表示相對應關係的個數，我們利用這個
因素來表達不同關係的強度。 
iii. BQk 代表部落格本身的品質的好壞，我們利用
一些直觀的量化值來表示部落格的品質，
如：部落格的文章數，文章發表的時間週
期等。 
當上述三種因素均統計完成後，我們最後可經由
公式（4）來計算每個部落格相對應的聲望值。 
 
3. 實驗資料與結果比較 
我們使用國內比較知名的幾間部落格服務商
(BSP)的部落格資料，做數據分析及方法驗證，基本
數據分析及統計如表格二及表格三所示。 
在表格二，我們可以看出我們在不同的部落格服

顯示出相對應於不同的部落格服務商中的部落格間
的互動總數。

四、創新技術說明 
為了最有效的利用部落客在廣大的部落格環境
中所做的各種有關社交網路(Social Network)的互動
關係，我們發展出一套利用視覺樹的架構自動擷取部
落格文章資訊，並定義了一個基於以這種互動關係為
連結的網路模型，利用這個網路模型，修改了Google
的PageRank，發展出一套較適用於此網路模型的演
算法BRank，且經由一系列的實驗驗證了BRank的可
行性及可靠度。 
 
五、技術推廣及運用的價值

bloggers to provide blog URLs for ranking. 
BlogLook is a prominent blog ranking service 
in Taiwan. Its data contain over 210,000 blogs. 
Instead of analyzing the actual blog content, 
blog information is retrieved from several blog 
search engines, including the Technorati 
authority, and the number of links and 
subscriptions, etc. However, detailed 
information such as content, comments, links, 
and citations within blogs is not considered 
comprehensively in these services. Though the 
number of blog interactions is used to calculate 
the authority score for Technorati, comments 
are ignored, and various interactions are all 
treated as the same.  
In this paper, we define the popularity of a blog 
as the ability to prompt interactive behaviors in 
other bloggers. For a famous blog or a blog 
with a high popularity, the content is normally 
informative and useful for some readers. Posts 
in such a blog could be insightful discussions 
or innovative opinions depending on subjective 
judgments. However, analyzing this content to 
understand the relationship between bloggers 
and readers is not a trivial and objective task. 
Thus, other factors that reveal the behaviors of 
readers should be found.  
Through the influence of a blog post that 
receives comments from many bloggers, the 
post’s author has an impact on the readers and 
commentators. In this way, the referenced post 
shows the impact of the writing quality on its 
popularity. Also, bloggers subscribe to other 
blogs that are informative for them. This 
interaction could also be interpreted as an 
impact on the subscribers. For these 
observations, we made some assumptions in 
measuring the popularity of blogs. A popular 
blog may have more support relationships with 
other blogs than a general blog does. Users 
may cite a blog or a blog post in other web 
pages, including personal web sites, forums, or 
any other web content. When a blog is 
frequently referenced on the internet, we can 
say that the blog has high popularity.  
For a hyperlinked set of pages, PageRank 
[14] assigns a score to each page representing 
its relative importance, i.e., popularity or 
reputation, among pages. The linking structure 
in the blogosphere is similar to that of web 
sites, but with additional characteristics. Thus, 
a general ranking method based on the general 
linking structure is not appropriate for the 
structure of a blogosphere. In this paper, we 
augment the interactions between bloggers to 
represent the visiting probabilities in 
PageRank. As illustrated in Figure 1, we use 
blog interactive behaviors to construct a blog 
network model that describes the 
blog-specialized linking structure. Four types 
of explicit links are included in this linking 
model: comments, trackbacks, citations, and 
blogrolls. The types of links represent distinct 
relationships between bloggers. Furthermore, 
bloggers may know and visit some blogs in 
which they become interested by searching for 
common interests and topics search engines. 
These visitors do not always leave comments 
on posts that they read, but they share common 
interests in general. Thus, we assume that these 
are implicit links, i.e., interest links, between 
these bloggers. These explicit and implicit 
relationships could represent interactions 
among bloggers and are also useful to identify 
popularities of bloggers. We call the specific 
network formed by these blogging 
relationships a social blog network (SBN). We 
then apply a weighted and interaction-aware 
linking analysis called “BRank” to this specific 
network to rank the varying popularities of 
links to increase the density of the blogs’ graph 
based on similarities in topics and users. They 
modified PageRank into an algorithm for 
ranking blogs called BlogRank. Comments are 
not considered in their work. As the most 
frequent interactions, comments show their 
importance in our work. B2Rank [12], 
presented by Mohammad, is also modified 
from PageRank. With the proposed algorithm, 
each blog is assigned a personality score and 
an operation score. The scores are mainly 
obtained based on blogrolls and citations. Nitin 
et al. [13] investigated the behaviors of 
influential bloggers and presented a 
preliminary model to quantify them. Their 
work focuses on the community of blogs, and 
our study targets the individual blogs. 
 
3. Method 
Our proposed method is based on the 
characteristics of blogs, which includes the 
linking structure and blog interest similarity 
features. We first introduce the idea of 
measuring blog popularity and present how the 
proposed blog network model is constructed. 
The ranking algorithm will be detailed in the 
last subsection. 
 
3.1. Link analysis 
The linking structure of the blogosphere is 
different from that of general web pages. The 
social interconnection between bloggers should 
be considered in constructing the network. 
When a blogger performs blog interactions 
such as comments and trackbacks, the link 
information is generated in the blog pages. The 
blog-specific linking structure is constructed in 
this way. For example, when blogger A 
comments on a blog post in blog B, a link to 
A is coded into the post page of B. Due to this 
inserted link, A is considered as receiving a 
vote from B in PageRank. However, this may 
not be representative of support interactions 
from B. Indeed, the sender of the comment, A, 
sends a vote to B in this case. This describes 
how the linking structure of a blogosphere 
differs from that of general web pages. There 
will be reciprocal links when a trackback is 
sent from A to B. The link represents that A 
sends a vote to the receiver B, although links 
are present in both blog pages. The posts 
connected by trackback interactions are 
normally related. Visitors may read relevant 
posts by traversing the trackbacks if they are 
interested in that topic. Therefore, A, who 
sends the trackback, is also supported by B, 
since the post link is listed in B. This kind of 
interaction is regarded as a reciprocal 
relationship.  
Blog readers can determine the topics of blogs 
while browsing the blog posts. If readers are 
interested in a certain topic, they are likely to 
read blogs containing similar content. We 
hence assume that if A and B are similar, i.e., 
sharing common interests, there will be some 
probability for readers of A to read B. Links 
mentioned frequently may refer to certain hot 
topics. The co-occurrence of hyperlinks in the 
posts between distinct blogs is regarded as an 
interest similarity relationship in the proposed 
model. 
 
3.2. Social Blog Network 
Two genres of blog relationships between 
blogs are defined in the blog network model. 
Interactions or links from A to B indicate that 
A is a reader of B, and we take these explicit 
relationships as support relationships. Implicit 
relationships. Four blog relationships are 
comments, trackbacks, blogrolls, and citations. 
Different blog relationships are assigned 
different weights (WRtype), since they have 
distinct meanings for a blogger. In our 
experiments, Wcomment is set to 0.25 and others 
are set to 1. This setting simply represents the 
diversity of the easiness of making a 
relationship. In our observation, to leave a 
comment is the easiest way to support a 
blogger by using the blogging interface. The 
second factor is the number of the 
corresponding relationship. Here we simply 
use the degree of the number (RNRtype) to 
express the strength of the relationship. Instead 
of the actual numbers, we use the natural log of 
the actual numbers. The last one is the blog 
quality score (BQk), which is a combination of 
the normalized blog features, such as the 
number of sub-categories, the number of 
custom categories, last article date, the 
commented post count, the tracked post count, 
the average blog / post life cycle. We use the 
time span between the last date and first date 
for all posts to represent a blog's life cycle. 
These metrics are automatically extracted from 
datasets. The blog quality score shows the 
basic activity of a blog. That is, a higher 
quality score for a blog represents that 
relationships related to this blog are stronger 
than others, and it may receive more support 
from other bloggers. We assumed that the 
probability of moving to a blog with a higher 
quality score is greater than that of moving to 
others. This quality score is also converted to 
the natural log value for calculation. The 
relationship score combines all kinds of 
relationship between two blogs. The 
relationship score from blog A to blog K is 
defined as follows. 
∑ ∗∗=→
Rtype

(3) 
We compute the relationship score for each 
directed node pair in the social blog network. A 
directed node pair could be connected by 
several support edges, a bidirectional interest 
edge, or both kinds of edges. We then apply the 
random walking on the network with the 
modification of the propagation probability. 
BRank can thus be defined as follows.

         (4) 
, where I(A) represents the set of blogs linking 
to A, and d is the damping factor as in the 
original PageRank algorithm. 
In general, anonymous comments and 
cross-BSP trackbacks are allowed in the 
blogosphere. Due to the lack of identification 
mapping between BSPs, there is no effective 
and trustworthy method that considers the blog 
interaction for comparing blogs between 
different BSPs in a global view as we know it. 
We thus only consider relationships between 
users in the same BSP. Therefore, beyond the 
blog relationships, several countable features 
that take the effects of anonymous users into 
account are included to evaluate the 
importance of different relationships. These 
features are linking indices in search engines, 
such as Google Link Search, Google URL 
Search, and Technorati Link Search. 
Anonymous effects are considered in these 
features. The number of posts, the number of 
all comments, and the number of all trackbacks 
are also included to represent the anonymous 
and κ3, respectively. Kendall tau 
coefficient is defined as 
1)/2-n(n
n= c dn−τ , 
where nc is the number of concordant 
pairs, and nd is the number of discordant 
pairs between the result list and the 
ground truth. The denominator in the 
definition of τ can be interpreted as the 
total number of pairs of items. A high 
value in the numerator means that most 
pairs are concordant, indicating that the 
two rankings are consistent. 
In order to test the effects of different blog 
relationships, several ranking processes are 
performed with various settings of weights in 
the algorithm. In Figure 3, we show the results 
for different weighting schemes. The effects of 
different relationships vary across BSPs.
