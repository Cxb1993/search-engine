rotation distance between any two n-node rooted 
binary trees is the minimum number of rotations 
needed to transform one into another. It is still an 
open problem to determine whether rotation distance 
can be computed in polynomial-time or not. For any 
two n-node rooted binary trees, the upper and lower 
bounds of rotations for any two n-node rooted binary 
trees are 2n-6 and 2n- n , respectively. 
 
In 2004, Lucas presented an O(n2)-time algorithm for 
finding the rotation distance between two binary 
trees under the constraint that the source tree is a 
degenerate tree and the destination tree is an angle 
tree, where angle trees are subset of degenerate 
trees. Under this constraint, we have improved time-
complexity into O(n). Meanwhile, we defined another 
subset of binary trees, say RLW-set, and proposed a 
linear-time algorithm to construct a series of 
rotations for transforming T and T’ with minimum 
rotations, where T and T’ are both RLW-trees. 
 
In the first year of this study, we will intend to 
propose an algorithm for finding the rotation 
distance between any two degenerate trees. During the 
second year, we will define more subsets of binary 
trees in which the rotation distance between any two 
binary trees of each subset can be found exactly. In 
addition, we will explore more characteristics of 
these subsets. Our goal is to propose an integrated 
algorithm for calculating the rotation distance 
between any two trees in these subsets. These subsets 
can be considered as kernels of all binary trees. It 
is possible to extend them to find the rotation of 
any two binary trees efficiently. In the last year, 
we will intend to reduce the upper bounds of 
rotations for any two n-node binary trees.

一、 報告內容 
 
A binary tree T considered here is a rooted, ordered tree with n internal nodes v1, v2, . . . , vn where 
the indices are numbered according to the in-order traversal (i.e., visit recursively left subtree, root and 
then right subtree) of T and, thus, each internal node is restricted to having exactly two children, a left 
child and a right child. Such a binary tree is also called an extended binary tree. Binary trees form a 
fundamental data structure in computer science and have been extensively studied over the past forty 
years. There are a number of ways for measuring the shape difference between two binary trees with 
the same number of nodes. One of the most common measurements is the number of rotations required. 
Rotations are primitive steps in tree balancing for AVL-tree and splay trees, and so on. Basically, a 
rotation is a local restructuring that transforms one tree into another such that in-order sequence of 
these two trees is the same. Figure 1 illustrates the two fundamental rotation operations, the left 
rotation and the right rotation, applied at the node x and y, respectively, of a binary tree. 
 
Figure 1: The left rotation and right rotation. 
The studies of combinatorial properties related to rotations have been an important issue for 
binary trees. For example, enumerating binary trees with a Gray code with respect to rotations was 
studied in. In another, a well-known one to one correspondence between a binary tree with n nodes 
and a triangulation of a convex polygon with n+2 vertices was established in. This implies that 
flipping an edge in a triangulation corresponds exactly to a rotation on the corresponding binary tree. 
See Figure 2 as an illustration. 
 
Furthermore, Gibbons and Sant showed the coloring problem can be coupled to rotational paths 
between two trees. In 1986, Pallo introduced the left weight sequence for binary trees and showed that 
ever binary tree can be characterized by a left weight sequence. Meanwhile, Pallo also proved that the 
rotations on binary trees with n nodes induce a combinatorial structure called nth Tamari lattice, i.e., 
an n-element partially ordered set with a unique maximum element and minimum element, 
respectively. Consequently, coding binary trees by the left weight sequences is a valuable tool for 
studying the Tamari lattices.  
 4 
were improved significantly by Cleary and Lucas. Pallo generalized this restriction to resolve the 
rotation distance under the situation that rotations are only allowed at nodes along the right arm of the 
trees. 
 
We say that a binary tree T is degenerate if each node in T has at most one child. A degenerate 
tree T is called an angle tree if the right (respectively, left) child of the root of T is not empty and every 
node in T that has a non-empty right (respectively, left) child is an ancestor of every node in T that has 
a non-empty left (respectively, right) child. Actually, the set of restricted form contains 2n−1 binary 
trees. Lucas proposed an O(n2)-time algorithm for computing dis(T0, Tf) with the minimum number of 
rotations. Under this constraint, we have improved time-complexity into O(n). Lately, by using the 
coding technique of left weight sequences, we defined another set of 2n−1 binary trees in which any 
two of them can be rotated with the exact rotation distance. 
 
The weight of a binary tree T, denoted by w(T), is n+1, i.e., the number of leaves (external nodes) 
in the tree. For each internal node vi∈T, the subtree rooted at vi is denoted by Ti. Clearly, Ti contains 
w(Ti) − 1 internal nodes. The left subtree of vi is the subtree rooted at the left child of vi and is denoted 
by Li. The left weight of vi in T, denoted wl(T, i), is equal to w(Li) and the integer sequence wl(T) = 
(wl(T, 1),wl(T, 2), . . . ,wl(T, n)) is called the left weight sequence (LW-sequence for short) of T.  
 
We define that an LW-sequence wl(T) is said to be a restricted LW-sequence, abbreviated 
RLW-sequence, if wl(T, i) is either 1 or i, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. A binary tree T is called an RLW-tree if 
wl(T) is an RLW-sequence. The set containing all RLW-trees of n internal nodes is called an RLW-set. 
Since the first position of any RLW-sequence is always 1 and all of the other positions have two 
possible values, there are 2n−1 binary trees in an RLW-set in which every binary tree has n internal 
nodes. In addition, the RLW-tree looks like an inclined curtain. That is, each node is either on the 
left-arm of this tree, or has no left child. Our algorithm can be done in linear time for finding the 
rotation distance between any two trees in the restricted set. Moreover, actual sequence of 
transforming rotations can also be built. 
 
The number of binary trees with n nodes is the well-known Catalan numbers, denoted by 
𝐵𝑛 = 1𝑛+1𝐶𝑛2𝑛. Let L and R denote the set of degenerate trees and RLW-trees, respectively. Since the 
rotation distance between any two trees in R can be found in linear time, it remains to be determining 
the rotation distance between any two degenerate trees T0 and Tf , that is, removing the restriction that 
Tf must be an angle tree. This case is significantly more complex.

The Weighted Minimum Tuple 2-Rainbow Domination on Graphs
William Chung-Kung Yen, Jia-Jie Liu, and Chao-Cheng Shih
Abstract—Let G(V,E) be a connected and undirected graph with
n-vertex-set V and m-edge-set E. Each vertex v is associated with
two positive weights, w1(v) and w2(v). If w1(v) = 1 and w2(v) =
1, for all v ∈ V , then G is called an unweighted graph. For each v ∈
V , let N(v) = {u|u ∈ V and (u, v) ∈ E} and N [v] = N(v)∪{v}.
A tuple 2-rainbow domination function of G is a function f mapping
each vertex v to a Boolean string f(v) = f2(v)f1(v), f1(v), f2(v) ∈
{0, 1}, such that u∈N [v] f(u) = 11 for all v ∈ V , where u∈N [v]
f(u) is the resut of taking bitwise OR operation on f(u), for all u ∈
N [v]. The weight of f is defined as w(f) =
P
v∈V (f1(v)w1(v) +
f2(v)w2(v)). The objective of our problem is to identify a tuple 2-
rainbow domination function f of G such that w(f) is minimized.
This paper first proves that the problem is NP-Hard on unweighted
planar graphs. Then, an O(n)-time optimal algorithm for the problem
on trees is proposed using the dynamic programming strategy.
Keywords—(Tuple) k-rainbow domination function, planar graphs,
trees, NP-Hard.
I. INTRODUCTION
Domination and its variations on graphs are natural models
for many location problems in Operations Research and related
fields. They have been studied extensively in the literature
[5], [6]. The k-rainbow domination is one of important
variations which was introduced by Bresar et. al. [1]. Let
G(V,E) be a connected and undirected graph, where V and
E are the vertex-set and the edges-set of G, respectively. For
each v ∈ V , let N(v) = {u|u ∈ V and (u, v) ∈ E} and
N [v] = N(v) ∪ {v}. Given a positive integer k, let h denote
a function mapping each vertex v of G to a k-bit Boolean
string h(v) = hk(v)hk−1(v) . . . h1(v), i.e., hi(v) ∈ {0, 1},
1 ≤ i ≤ k. Meanwhile, for any subset S of V , u∈S h(u)
denotes the result of taking bitwise OR operation on h(u),
for all u ∈ S. For convenience, we also use u∈{x,y} h(u) to
represent h(x)  h(y). Denote 1(k) (respectively, 0(k)) as the
k-bit Boolean string with exactly k 1s’ (respectively, k 0s’).
The function h is called a k-rainbow domination function of
G if u∈N(v) h(u) = 1(k), for all v ∈ V with h(v) = 0(k).
The weight of a k-rainbow domination function h of G is
defined as w(h) =
∑
v∈V
∑k
i=1(hi(v)). The following states
the formal definition of the Minimum k-Rainbow Domination
problem.

Output: A k-rainbow domination function h of G such that
w(h) is minimized.
In [1], the MkRD problem was originally studied and a
linear-time algorithm on trees, for k = 2, was also proposed.
Later, the authors in [2] proved that the MkRD problem is
NP-Hard on chordal graphs and bipartite graphs, respectively,
and proposed a linear-time algorithm on trees, for all k. Re-
cently, an improved Nordhaus-Gaddum bounds for k-rainbow
domatic number of a graph was derived [7].
In this paper, we consider a new variant of the MkRD
problem. The motivation of this new problem comes from
the following practical resource allocation model. Consider a
network modeled as a graph G(V,E), where V represents the
set of nodes and E is the set of direct links of node pairs. Two
types of resources, R1 and R2, will be allocated at some nodes
to serve requests from clients all over the network. For each
node v, w1(v) and w2(v) denote the costs of allocating R1
and R2 at v, respectively. We require that the clients at each
node v can access both R1 and R2 from v and all neighboring
nodes of v, i.e., every client can access both resources via at
most one direct transmission. The objective is to minimize the
total allocation cost over the entire network.
Before defining our problem formally, let us introduce some
terms and concepts. In the rest of this paper, each vertex v of
all consider graphs G(V,E) is associated with two positive
weights, w1(v) and w2(v). If w1(v) = 1 and w2(v) = 1, for
all v ∈ V , then G is called an unweighted graph. Let f be a
function mapping each vertex v of G to a 2-bit Boolean string
f(v) = f2(v)f1(v), where f1(v), f2(v) ∈ {0, 1}. A vertex v
of G is called a 00-node if f(v) = 00. 01-nodes, 10-nodes,
and 11-nodes can be defined similarly. In addition, a vertex
v of G is called a 00-dominated node if u∈N [v] f(u) = 00.
01-dominated nodes, 10-dominated nodes, and 11-dominated
nodes can also be defined similarly. Such a function f is
called a tuple 2-ranibow domination function of G if every
vertex v of G is a 11-dominated node. The weight of f is
defined as w(f) =
∑
v∈V (f1(v)w1(v) + f2(v)w2(v)). The
issue as stated in previous paragraph leads us to study the
following new problem.
The Weighted Minimum Tuple 2-Rainbow Domination
problem (The WMT2RD problem)
Input: A graph G(V,E) with n-vertex-set V and m-edge-set
E in which each vertex v is associated two positive weights,
w1(v) and w2(v).
Output: A tuple 2-rainbow domination function f of G such
that w(f) is minimized.
This paper presents an original study about the algorithmic
aspect of the WMT2RD problem. In Section 2, we will show

λd1d2i denote the minimum value of the 0/1-component com-
position problem with Si = {s1, s2, . . . , si} and d1d2 = c1c2,
for 1  i  n. In the following, we describe a recurrence
formula for computing λd1d2i . For i > 1,
λd1d2i =

with initial conditions λ001 = α1, λ011 = β1, λ101 = γ1, and
λ111 = δ1.
Theorem 3. The 0/1-component composition problem can be
solved in O(n) time.
Proof. Since each value of λ00i , λ01i , λ10i , and λ11i can be
computed in constant time, this theorem follows directly. 
Now, we will show how to solve the WMT2RD problem on
trees. For convenience, we call formula (7) for describing the
0/1-component composition problem as the 0/1-component
formula. Given a tree T , we select an arbitrary vertex from
V (T ) as the root of tree T . We assume that the root of a tree
T is with label r. For any vertex u ∈ T , let p(u) denote the
parent of u and C(u) stand for the set of children of u. The
subtree of T rooted at vertex v is denoted by Tv , and, for a
tuple 2-rainbow domination function f of V (T ), let fv denote
the mapping function f of V (Tv). The weight of fv is denoted
as w(fv) =
∑
v∈Tv (f1(v)w1(v) + f2(v)w2(v)). We say fv is
a semifinished function if every node u ∈ Tv \ {v} is a 11-
dominated node. Let α(v), β(v), γ(v), and δ(v) denote the
minimum weight semifinished function fv if v is a 00-node,
01-node, 10-node, and 11-node of Tv , respectively. A semifin-
ished function fv is called a 00-function (respectively, 01-
function, 10-function, and 11-function) if v is a 00-dominated
node (respectively, 01-dominated node, 10-dominated node,
and 11-dominated node) in Tv . Let tc1c2b1b2(v) denote the weight
of any minimum weight semifinished function fv in which v
is a b1b2-node and fv is a c1c2-function, where b1, b2, c1, c2 ∈
{0, 1}. Note that t0001(v) = ∞ since it is impossible that v
is a 01-node and v also is 00-dominated node. Similarly,
t1001(v) = ∞, t0010(v) = ∞, t0110(v) = ∞, t0011(v) = ∞,
t0111(v) = ∞, and t1011(v) = ∞. The following propositions
hold directly.
Proposition 4. Let f be a minimum weight tuple 2-rainbow
domination function in T and v be an internal vertex of T .
The following statements are true.
(i) If v is a 00-node, then fu is a 11-function, for all u ∈
C(v).
(ii) If v is a 01-node, then fu is a 10-function or 11-function,
for all u ∈ C(v).
(iii) If v is a 10-node, then fu is a 01-function or 11-function,
for all u ∈ C(v).
(iv) If v is a 11-node, then fu is a 00-function, 01-function,
10-function, or 11-function, for all u ∈ C(v).
Proposition 5. Let f be a minimum weight tuple 2-rainbow
domination function in T and v = r be an internal vertex of
T . The following statements are true.
(i) If p(v) is a 00-node, then α(v) = t1100(v), β(v) = t1101(v),
γ(v) = t1110(v), and δ(v) = t1111(v).
(ii) If p(v) is a 01-node, then α(v) = min{t1100(v), t1000(v)},
β(v) = t1101(v), γ(v) = min{t1110(v), t1010(v)}, and δ(v) =
t1111(v).
(iii) If p(v) is a 10-node, then α(v) = min{t1100(v), t0100(v)},
β(v) = min{t1101(v), t0101(v)}, γ(v) = t1110(v), and δ(v) =
t1111(v).
(iv) If p(v) is a 11-node, then α(v) =
min{t1100(v), t0100(v), t1000(v), t0000(v)}, β(v) =
min{t1101(v), t0101(v)}, γ(v) = min{t1110(v), t1010(v)},
and δ(v) = t1111(v).
In the following, we introduce how to compute tc1c2b1b2(v),
where b1, b2, c1, c2 ∈ {0, 1}, for each vertex v ∈ V (T ). For a
subtree Tv , assume that C(v) = {v1, v2, . . . , v|C(v)|}. If v is
a leaf vertex of T , the values of its associated tc1c2b1b2(v), where
b1, b2, c1, c2 ∈ {0, 1}, are described in Proposition 6.
Proposition 6. If v is a leaf vertex of T , then t0000(v) = 0,
t0101(v) = w1(v), t
10
10(v) = w2(v), t
11
11(v) = w1(v) + w2(v),
and tc1c2b1b2(v) = ∞ while c1c2 = b1b2.
Lemma 7. If v is an internal vertex of T , then t0000(v) = λ00p
(respectively, t0100(v) = λ01p , t1000(v) = λ10p , and t1100(v) = λ11p )
after setting p = |C(v)| and (αi, βi, γi, δi), for 1 ≤ i ≤ p, are
obtained by Proposition 5 while v is a 00-node.
Proof. Since v is a 00-node, u∈C(v) f(u) = 00 (respectively,
01, 10, and 11) while fv is a 00-function (respectively,
01-function, 10-function, and 11-function). Since z = λ00p
(respectively, λ01p , λ10p , and λ11p ) is the minimum solution
such that u∈C(v) f(u) = 00 (respectively, 01, 10, and 11),

Cycle embedding in folded hypercubes with more
faulty elements
Wen-Yin Huang, Jia-Jie Liu, and Jou-Ming Chang
Abstract—Faults in a network may take various forms such as
hardware/software errors, vertex/edge faults, etc. Folded hypercube
is a well-known variation of the hypercube structure and can be con-
structed from a hypercube by adding a link to every pair of nodes with
complementary addresses. Let FFv (respectively, FFe) be the set of
faulty nodes (respectively, faulty links) in an n-dimensional folded
hypercube FQn. Hsieh et al. have shown that FQn − FFv − FFe
for n ≥ 3 contains a fault-free cycle of length at least 2n − 2|FFv|,
under the constraints that (1) |FFv| + |FFe| ≤ 2n − 4 and (2)
every node in FQn is incident to at least two fault-free links. In this
paper, we further consider the constraints |FFv|+ |FFe| ≤ 2n− 3.
We prove that FQn − FFv − FFe for n ≥ 5 still has a fault-free
cycle of length at least 2n − 2|FFv|, under the constraints : (1)
|FFv|+ |FFe| ≤ 2n− 3, (2) |FFe| ≥ n+ 2, and (3) every vertex
is still incident with at least two links.

I. INTRODUCTION
HYPERCUBES are a powerful network that is able toperform various kinds of parallel computations and
simulate many other networks [14], [15]. Hypercubes have
been widely studied in interconnection networks [6], [7], [8],
[20]. A number of other topologies, such as paths, trees, rings,
and meshes, can be embedded into a hypercube. There are also
many related results in hypercubes with faulty vertices or link
[2], [3], [5], [13], [16]. One of the most popular variants is
the folded hypercube, which is an extension of the hypercube
and can be constructed by adding a link to every pair of nodes
with complementary address. The folded hypercube has been
shown to be able to improve the system’s performance over a
regular hypercube in many measurements [1], [17].
Since faults may happen on both nodes and edges in a
network, it is practically meaningful and important to consider
faulty networks. A node is fault-free if it is not faulty. A link
is fault-free if the communication link between end-nodes is
not faulty. A path (cycle) is fault-free if it contains neither
faulty nodes nor faulty links. Previously, the problem of fault-
tolerant embedding on an n-dimensional folded hypercube
FQn has been studied in [9], [10], [17], [18], [19]. Let FFv
(respectively, FFe) be the set of faulty nodes (respectively,
faulty links) in an n-dimensional folded hypercube FQn.
Hsieh et al. [12] have shown that FQn − FFv − FFe for

n ≥ 3 contains a fault-free cycle of length at least 2n−2|FFv|,
under the constraints that (1) |FFv| + |FFe| ≤ 2n − 4 and
(2) every node in FQn is incident to at least two fault-
free links. In this paper, we further consider the constraints
|FFv|+|FFe| ≤ 2n−3. We prove that FQn−FFv−FFe for
n ≥ 5 still has a fault-free cycle of length at least 2n−2|FFv|,
under the constraints : (1) |FFv| + |FFe| ≤ 2n − 3, (2)
|FFe| ≥ n + 2, and (3) every vertex is still incident with
at least two links.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we describe some important properties in folded hypercubes.
We present our main result in Section 3. Concluding remarks
are given in Section 4.
II. PRELIMINARIES
An n-dimensional hypercube Qn, also called an n-cube,
can be modeled as a graph with vertex set V (Qn) and edge
set E(Qn). In Qn, there are 2n vertices and n2n−1 links.
Each vertex u of Qn can be distinctly labeled by an n-bit
string bnbn−1 · · · b2b1. For any i, 1  i  n, we use u(i)
to denote the binary string bnbn−1 · · · b¯ibi−1 · · · b1. Thus, if
vertices u and v are adjacent, then u = v(i) and v = u(i) for
some 1  i  n and we call the edge uu(i) an i-dimensional
edge. We will also refer to the edge uu(i) as di(u). Thus, if
v = u(i), then v(j) = (u(i))(j) is simpliﬁed as u(i)(j). Let Ei =
{di(u)|u ∈ V (Qn)}, i.e., the set containing all i-dimensional
edges of Qn. It is clear that |Ei| = 2n−1 for every 1  i  n.
An n-dimensional folded hypercube FQn can be con-
structed from an n-dimensional hypercube by adding a link
to every pair of nodes with complementary addresses, e.g.,
node x = bnbn−1 · · · b2b1 and node x¯ = b¯nb¯n−1 · · · b¯2b¯1. Thus
FQn has 2n−1 more links than a regular hypercube. We call
these extra links skips to distinguish them from regular links.
Let Es be the set of skips in FQn. Figure 1 illustrates a 2-
dimensional and a 3-dimensional folded hypercubes.
A path P of length k from vertex x to vertex y in FQn is
a sequence of distinct vertices v0, v1, . . . , vk in which x = v0,
y = vk, and vivi+1 ∈ E(FQn), for i = 0, 1, . . . k − 1, where
k  1. We also use 〈v0,P ,vk〉 as another representation of
P in order to indicate the two endpoints v0 and vk of P .
For consistency, an edge uv can also be represented as a
path 〈u, v〉. For two paths 〈x,P, y〉 and 〈u,Q, v〉 in which
y and u are adjacent, we use 〈x,P, y, u,Q, v〉 to denote the
concatenation of paths P and Q. A cycle is also a sequence
of distinct vertices v0, v1, . . . , vk except v0 = vk. In the
following, we introduce some previous results that will be
employed later.

links. By Lemma 3, there exists a fault-free cycle CL of length
2n−1−2|FLv | in QLn−1−FLv −FLe since |FLv |+|FLe | ≤ 2n−6,
|FLe | ≤ 2n−7, and every node in QLn−1 is incident to at least
two fault-free links.
If u, u(a) ∈ CL, then we denote u(1) and u(a)(1) by x and y,
respectively; otherwise, we choice any link (p, q) ∈ CL such
that d1(p) and d1(q) are two non-faulty links and denote p(1)
and q(1) by x and y, respectively. Since u is a 2-free node,
F (E1) ≥ 2, and |FFv|+|FFe| ≤ 2n−3, |FRv |+|FRe | ≤ n−4.
By Lemma 4, edge da(x) lies on a fault-free cycle CR of length
2n−1 − 2|FRv | in QRn−1 − FRv − FRe since |FRv | + |FRe | ≤
(n − 1) − 2. Therefore, we can obtain a fault-free cycle 〈
u, CL, u(a), y, CR, x, u 〉 (respectively, 〈 p, CL, q, y, CR, x, p 〉)
of length 2n−1−2|FLv |−1+2n−1−2|FRv |−1+2=2n−2|FFv|.
Subcase 2.2: If da(u) is a faulty link, then d1(u(a)) is also a
faulty link, for a ∈ {3, 4, . . . , n} ∪ {s} (see Figure 2(b)).
Since |FFv| + |FFe| ≤ 2n − 3 and |FFe| ≥ n + 2,
|FFv| ≤ n−5. If |FFv| = 0, then |FFe| ≥ 2n−2 since every
faulty link da(u) is adjacent to another faulty link d1(u(a)),
for a ∈ {3, 4, . . . , n} ∪ {s}. Therefore, |FFv| > 0. Since u is
a 2-free node in FQn and |FFv| ≤ n−5, there exists at least
four faulty links, say d3(u), d4(u), d5(u), and d6(u), such
that d1(u(3)), d1(u(4)), d1(u(5)) , and d1(u(6)) are also fault.
Hence, FQn − E3 is isomorphic to Qn and Qn can be de-
composed to QLn−1 and Q
R
n−1 at dimension 4 and u ∈ QLn−1.
Note that, d1(u(3)), d1(u(5)), and d1(u(6)) are in QLn−1 while
d1(u(4)) is in QRn−1. Thus, |FLv |+|FLe | ≤ 2n−3−3 = 2n−6.
Since |FFv| > 0 and |FLv |+ |FLe | ≤ 2n− 6, |FLe | ≤ 2n− 7.
Since FL(u) = n − 3, |FLv | + |FLe | ≤ 2n − 6, and d1(u(3)),
d1(u(5)) and d1(u(6)) are in QLn−1, F
L(j) ≤ n − 4 for all
j ∈ QLn−1 except u. Thus, every node in QLn−1 is incident at
least two fault-free links. By Lemma 3, there exists a fault-
free cycle CL of length 2n−1 − 2|FLv | in QLn−1 − FLv − FLe
since |FLv |+ |FLe | ≤ 2n− 6, |FLe | ≤ 2n− 7, and every node
in QLn−1 is incident to at least two fault-free links.
Choose any link, say da(x), in CL such that x(4) and x(a)(4)
are non-faulty nodes in QRn−1 and d
4(x) and d4(x(a)) are
non-faulty links. Since u is a 2-free node, both d1(u(3)) and
d1(u(5)) are in QLn−1, and |FFv|+ |FFe| ≤ 2n− 3, |FRv |+
|FRe | ≤ n − 5. By Lemma 4 again, edge da(x(4)) lies on a
fault-free cycle CR of length 2n−1−2|FRv | in QRn−1−FRv −FRe
since |FRv | + |FRe | ≤ (n − 1) − 2. Therefore, we can obtain
a fault-free cycle 〈 x, CL, x(a), x(a)(4), CR, x(4), x 〉 of length
2n−1 − 2|FLv | − 1+2n−1 − 2|FRv | − 1+2=2n − 2|FFv|.
Case 3: There are two 2-free nodes u and v in FQn.
Since |FFv| + |FFe| ≤ 2n − 3 and there are two 2-free
nodes u and v in FQn, u and v are adjacent, |FFv|+|FFe| =
2n − 3. Assume without loss of generality that link (u, v) =
d1(u) = d1(v). Assume that da(u), db(u), dc(v), and dd(v)
are four non-fautly links with respect to u and v, where a = b,
c = d, and a, b, c, d ∈ {2, 3, . . . , n} ∪ {s}. Since n ≥ 5 and
|FFe| ≥ n + 2, there exists a dimension k such that dk(u)
and dk(v) are faulty links, where k ∈ {2, 3, . . . , n} ∪ {s} −
{a, b, c, d}. By Corollary 2, FQn − Ek is isomorphic to Qn.
Thus, |FFv|+ |FFe| ≤ 2n− 5 in Qn and every node in Qn
is incident at least two fault-free links. By Lemma 3, there
exists a fault-free cycle of length 2n − 2|Fv| (=2n − 2|FFv|)
in Qn − Fv − Fe since |Fv|+ |Fe| ≤ 2n− 4, |Fe| ≤ 2n− 5,
