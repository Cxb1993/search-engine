Theoretical and experimental study of the interactions of progressive 
gravity waves and uniform current in Lagrangian system 
 
Abstract 
This paper presents a new third-order trajectory solution in Lagrangian form for 
the water particles in a wave-current interaction flow based on an Euler-Lagrange 
transformation. The explicit parametric solution highlights the trajectory of a water 
particle and the wave kinematics above the mean water level and within a vertical 
water column, which were calculated previously by an approximation method using 
Eulerian approach. Mass transport associated with a particle displacement can now be 
obtained directly in Lagrangian form. The angular frequency and Lagrangian mean 
level of the particle motion in Lagrangian form differ from those of the Eulerian. The 
variations in the wave profile and the water particle orbits resulting from the 
interaction with a steady uniform current of different magnitudes are also investigated. 
Comparion on the wave profiles given by the Eulerian and Lagrangian solution to a 
third-order reveals that the latter is more accurate than the former in describing the 
shape of the wave profile. Moreover, the influence of a following current is found to 
increase the relative horizontal distance traveled by a water particle, while the 
converse is true in the case of an opposing current.

1. Introduction 
The phenomenon of wave-current interaction has been studied extensively since 
1970s. Several theoretical solutions for waves on currents with uniform or sheared 
profiles have been well documented in the review articles of Peregrine [1], Jonsson [2] 
and Thomas & Klopman [3]. Reports were also available on experimental studies for 
combined wave and current covering various aspects of this problem [4-9].  
Most previous theories dealing with wave-current interactions have employed 
the Eulerian description, in which the free surface fluctuations can be expressed in a 
Taylor series expansion relative to a fixed water level (i.e., the still water level). This 
implicitly assumes that the surface profile of a wave is a differentiable single-valued 
function. Unlike the Eulerian free surface, which is given as an implicit function, a  
 2
for describing the fluid motion may yield similar results, despite the differences in the 
method of derivation and the final expressions of their solutions. Consequently, an 
approximate method based upon an expansion of the velocity field in a Taylor series 
is constructed in this paper. By using a successive expansion in a Taylor series for the 
water particle path and the period of a particle motion, the new expressions for the 
Lagrangian particle trajectories, the mass transport velocity and the period of particle 
motion can be derived from analytical solutions in Eulerian description for a water 
particle initially located at different vertical level associated with an arbitrary wave 
height. Moreover, the changes in water surface elevation resulting from the interaction 
with a following or opposing uniform current is also discussed in this paper. 
 In §2 we list the solutions of the wave-current interaction obtained by Chen [19] 
in Eulerian coordinates. The Euler-Lagrange transformation techniques are then 
described in §3 in order to derive a Lagrangian solution in a combined wave-current 
motion, from which a third-order parametric equation is obtained for the particle 
trajectory and mass transport. In §4 the trajectory of water particles and the variation 
in water surface elevation over the entire wave-interaction field are discussed. Finally, 
some concluding remarks are .given in §5. 
2. Solution for a wave-current field in Eulerian system 
Consider a classical problem of a two-dimensional monochromatic wave with a 
steady uniform current on an impermeable and horizontal bed (Figure 1). The fluid is 
assumed to be inviscid and the flow is irrotational, so that a velocity potential exists in 
the fluid domain. The Cartesian coordinate system is used, in which the x -axis is in 
the direction of wave progression, and the -axis is positive upwards from the still 
water level. Consider also the condition of weak current, and the effect of current is to 
change the wavelength of the existing wave properties with a given wave frequency. 
Based on the analytical solutions of periodic waves propagating over a uniform 
current in the Eulerian approach obtained by Chen [19], the resulting expressions for 
the velocity potential and water surface elevation to a third order approximation are 
given, respectively as：

Eq. (3.17) is the basic solution that describes the existence of a steady uniform 
current. In Eq. (3.18), 0L is the essential Lagrangian wave frequency for water 
particles relative to the uniform current. From this, it can be demonstrated that the 
Doppler’s effect is not apparent in the Lagrangian dispersion relation. This is because 
the Lagrangian representation describing fluid particles moving with a uniform 
current relative to water waves is given in a moving reference frame which does not 
appear to be transported by the uniform current.

4. Results and Discussions 
4.1 Water particle orbits 
In Figures 3a~3d, water particle orbits plotted for three different mean  
elevations b and different current magnitudes ( 0, 0.01rF   , ±0.03 and ), 
where Froude number 
0,05
/rF U gd , exhibit variations in orbital patterns, both in 
shapes and sizes, as a function of its original elevation. As can be expected that the 
orbital displacement based on a third-order solution is larger than that of a 
second-order (Figure 3a). The elongation or shortening of the orbits in the case with 
following or opposing current is apparent in Figures 3b~3d. Their orbital dimensions 
in the cases with positive Fr values reflect the magnitude of a following current, and 
the converse is true for condition with opposing current. It can be seen in each of the 
orbits plotted that a water particle advances a distance forward which is commonly 
referred to as mean horizontal drift or mass transport in the direction of wave 
propagation. The water particle at the free surface ( 0  ) travels fastest, whilst that 
in the interior of the fluid propagates slower. To the third-order approximation, the 
particle trajectory has non-closed orbit, irrespective of their initial mean locations. 
The orbital shapes near the bottom are more elliptic since the vertical excursion of the 
particle is less than its horizontal counterpart. However, for the orbits near or at the 
still water level, the vertical excursion is greater. Figure 3a also shows that the 
third-order solution has a greater horizontal and vertical excursion than the 
second-order solution at the free surface. It is noted that the particle orbits plotted in 
Figure 3a-3d resemble in shape the trajectories in an irrotational(Stokes) wave, whose 
form was recently proved by Constantin [20]. 
In the case of wave on a following current, the effect of increasing current speed 
is generally to augment the magnitude and extent of the time-averaged drift velocity, 
thus resulting in large horizontal distance traveled by a particle compared with the 
case without current. Again, the converse is true when a wave train encounters an 
 12
original nonlinear equations and the irrotational condition governing the wave motion. In 
the Lagrangian solution to a second-order, the Lagrangian mean level of a particle 
orbit over one wave period is found to be higher than that of the Eulerian, and it also 
has a time-dependent term referred to as the mass transport velocity which are 
applicable to the entire flow field. The wave frequency associated with water particle 
motions in Lagrangian form differs from that of the Eulerian , and the former is a 
function of wave steepness, uniform current speed and the Lagrangian vertical marked 
label b for each individual particle that can be obtained directly based on the 
third-order solutions.  
Comparison on the wave profiles to a third-order approximation between the 
Eulerain and Lagrangian descriptions reveals the former has a secondary wave in the 
trough for large wave in the intermediate to shallow water depth, whereas the latter gives 
a flatter shape. Therefore, the theoretical solution in Lagrangian form provides not 
only better but also accurate prediction for the free surface with large Froude number 
Fr associated with a uniform current than the Eulerian solution to the same order. 
From the trajectories of water particles resulting from wave-current interaction, it is 
found that particle displacement near the surface decreases due to its mass transport 
velocity is resisted by an opposing current. Again in the case with an opposing current, 
the water particle further beneath the still water level is mainly transported by the 
opposing current in the direction against the progressive wave, especially with a 
current in large Froude number . In the cases with a following current, the effect of 
increasing current speed is generally to increase the magnitude of the time-averaged 
mass transport velocity since the current is in the same direction as the wave 
propagation, thus resulting in augmentation to the horizontal distance traveled by a 
particle.
