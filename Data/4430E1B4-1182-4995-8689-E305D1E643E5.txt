-0.5mV/K with increasing temperature 
due to reduce the scattering effect and 
improve carrier confinement capability. 
Consequently, the proposed 
ILGC-HEMT is suitable for 
high-temperature and good linearity 
applications. 
 
Ⅲ. Introduction 
Over the past years, heterostructure 
field-effect transistors (HFET’s) and 
heterostructure bipolar transistors 
(HBT’s) have been widely studied for 
high-power and high-frequency 
integrated circuit applications 5-8). 
Particularly, InP-based HEMTs have 
demonstrated high-frequency and 
low-noise circuit applications due to 
their low effective electron mass, high 
low-field electron mobility, high 
electron saturation velocity and high 
sheet carrier densities in the InGaAs 
channel, as compared to those of 
GaAs-based HEMT’s. Nevertheless, the 
low energy-gap InGaAs compounds 
usually accompany with low 
impact-ionization threshold fields and 
kink effects, thus, considerably degrade 
the device performances, such as higher 
gate leakages, increased output 
conductance, and decreased off-state 
breakdown voltages. To resolve these 
problems, several approaches have been 
used, such as using an InP surface 
passivation layer over the InAlAs gate 
recess regions to suppress the 
ionized-hole current injected to the gate 
terminal to improve breakdown voltages 
[4, 5]. In addition, the InP layer is 
adopted as the etching-stop layer to 
precisely maintain the same Schottky 
layer thickness and to improve the 
uniformity of the device threshold and 
the extrinsic transconductance 
characteristics. Another way was to 
reduce the indium composition in the 
InGaAs channel to directly increase the 
impact-ionization threshold fields [6]. In 
this work, we present detailed 
comparison including DC 、 RF 
performances and 
temperature-dependence characteristics 
for δ-doped InAlAs/InxGa1-xAs/InP 
HEMT with linearity-graded channel 
and inverse linearity-graded channel. 
Experimentally, the linearity-graded 
channel improved device gain、current 
drive capability 、 gate leakages and 
output conductance characteristics. The 
HEMT with inverse linearity-graded 
channel demonstrates larger gate voltage 
swing and good thermal stability for 
high-temperature application.  
 
Ⅳ. Material Growth and Device 
Fabrication 
The studied structures were grown 
by the low-pressure metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition (LP-MOCVD) 
system on the Fe-doped semi-insulating 
InP substrates. Table I shows the 
epitaxial structures for the δ-doped 
In0.52Al0.48As/InxGa1-xAs/InP HEMT 
with linearly-graded channel 
(LGC-HEMT) and lattice match channel 
 4
where Nd is the donor concentration, ε is 
the position-dependent dielectric 
constant, ΔEC is conductance band 
discontinuities at the heterojunction, EF2 
is the difference between the conduction 
band edge and the Fermi energy in 
InAlAs, EFi is the Fermi level, di is the 
thickness of the spacer layer. In this 
work, since three structures have the 
same donor concentration and Shhottky 
layer, the 2DEG concentration would be 
determined by ΔEC. The LGC-HEMT 
has the large conductance band 
discontinuities (ΔEC) of 0.54 eV at the 
spacer/channel interface resulting 
highest 2DEG concentration compared 
with LMC-HEMT and ILGC-HEMT. As 
shown in Table II, the carrier 
concentration increases lightly and the 
mobility decreases quickly as 
temperature increases. The 
ILGC-HEMT demonstrates the highest 
carrier mobility at 77 K and 300K due to 
the inverse linearly-graded channel 
structure would shift the 2DEG closer to 
the channel/barrier interface where 
higher indium composition with lower 
effective mass was designed lead to the 
increased separating distance of the 
2DEG from the δ-doping ions would 
greatly improve the scattering effect, 
which can be observed from the 
significant improvement on carrier 
transport at 77 K.  
Figure 1 shows the common-source 
current-voltage characteristics of the all 
devices at room temperature, 
respectively. The high resistivity and 
high energy-gap of the In0.52Al0.48As 
barrier layer is intended to greatly 
reduce the electron injection into the 
buffer layer and to suppress the substrate 
leakage resulted in good pinch-off 
characteristics have been achieved in the 
three devices. As illustration in Fig. 1, 
the drain current density increases with 
increasing drain-source voltage due to 
the increased electric field resulted from 
impact ionization effect within the 
InGaAs channel regime for 
LMC-HEMT and ILGC-HEMT. 
Nevertheless, IDSS is nearly independent 
of VDS attributed to the improved impact 
ionization effect. Since the higher 
In-composition InGaAs compounds will 
have the lower impact-ionization 
coefficients, the LGC-HEMT was 
designed to have lower indium 
composition at the channel/buffer 
interface to improve its high-field kink 
effects. The electrons, as depleted 
farther away from the gate at decreased 
gate biases, will move to the InGaAs 
channel region with lower 
In-composition and wider energy-gap 
and, consequently, greatly improve the 
impact ionization-related kink effects of 
LGC-HEMT. Therefore, the 
LGC-HEMT improves significantly 
impact ionization effect lead to lower 
output conductance (gd) of 3.8 mS/mm 
compared with 9.3 mS/mm for 
LMC-HEMT and 12.4 mS/mm for 
ILGC-HEMT. The measured gate 
voltage was VDS = 2 V and VGS = 0 V for 
LGC-HEMT and LMC-HEMT and 
 6
decreases with increasing temperature 
due to the gm and ID is directly depend 
on proportional to carrier concentration 
and carrier mobility as shown in Eq (4) 
and (5). The carrier concentration 
increases as temperature increases. 
However, the carriers suffering from the 
phonon scattering and carrier-carrier 
scattering mechanisms lead to the mean 
free length is limited at high temperature. 
Therefore, the carrier mobility decreased 
resulting in the product of carrier 
concentration and carrier mobility 
decreased at high temperature. The 
ILGC-HEMT exhibits obviously smaller 
variations of gm and the thermal 
coefficient of gm,,max ( Tgm ∂∂ max, ) and 
ID,max ( TI D ∂∂ max, ) are -0.37 mS/mm-K 
and -0.345 mA/mm-K for ILGC-HEMT 
that is more stable than -0.505 
mS/mm-K and -0.44 mA/mm-K for 
LGC-HEMT and -0.46 mS/mm-K and 
-0.42 mA/mm-K for LMC-HEMT, 
respectively. This is because the carriers 
are accumulated near the channel/buffer 
interface and the increased separating 
distance of the 2DEG from the δ-doping 
ions greatly improve scattering lead to 
degradation of mobility is the smaller at 
high temperature. Beside, the threshold 
voltages (Vth) are determined by the 
extrapolated intercepts of (IDSS)1/2 vs. 
VGS curves. The threshold shift (ΔVth) 
from 300 K to 500 K and thermal 
coefficient of Vth ( TVth ∂∂ ) are -0.23/ 
-0.19/ -0.10 V and -1.15/ -0.95/ -0.5 
mV/K for LGC/LMC/ILGC-HEMT. The 
electrons within the channel, after 
gaining sufficient energies at high 
temperatures, tend to surpass over 
conduction-band discontinuities. These 
carriers will likely result in the excessive 
substrate leakages at high temperatures 
[11] lead to achieve pinch-off more 
difficult. The ILGC-HEMT has larger 
conductance band discontinuity (∆EC = 
0.54 eV) at the channel/buffer interface 
by using the inverse linearity-graded 
channel designed resulting in better 
carrier confinement capability within the 
channel at high temperature. 
Experimentally, the ILGC-HEMT 
demonstrated better thermal stability 
characteristics within the temperature 
regime from 300 K to 500K.  
    Define the gate-voltage swing 
(GVS) as the width of transconductance 
plateau of a 10 % reduction from the 
value of gm, max, the ILGC-HEMT has 
demonstrated an lager GVS of 0.65 V 
with the corresponding current regime of 
203 mA (31 mA ≤ IDSS ≤ 234 mA) than 
those of 0.4 V and 133 mA (44 mA ≤ 
IDSS ≤ 177 mA) in the LMC-HEMT and 
0.5 V and 167 mA (70 mA ≤ IDSS ≤ 237 
mA) in the LGC-HEMT, respectively, as 
shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the 
linearity current operating regime at 500 
K is still 149 mA for ILGC-HEMT 
higher than 85 mA for LMC-HEMT and 
124 mA for LGC-HEMT. For a 
conventional LMC-HEMT device, the 
μis constant and only Δd in Eq. (5)

temperature. Additionally, as the 
temperature increases above 400 K, the 
carriers within the channel suffering 
from the phonon scattering and 
carrier-carrier scattering mechanisms 
couldn’t obtain sufficient thermal energy 
and to initiate the impact ionization (1). 
The TFE/tunneling effect is more 
significant compare than impact 
ionization at the ambient temperature. 
Therefore, the reverse gate leakage 
current is dominated by TFE/tunneling 
mechanism. A formulation of the WKB 
approximation for tunneling probability 
at the Schottky gate is given as [22]

where A* is the effective Richardson 
constant, mt is the tunneling mass, φb is 
the barrier height, Φm is the work 
function of metal, ϕ is the electrostatic 
potential. The same InAlAs Schottky 
barrier layer and Pt/Au metal for three 
devices lead to the parameter of φb, Φm, 
mt and ϕ is similarity. Consequently, the 
breakdown voltage and turn-on voltage 
is similar for all devices as the 
temperature above 400K 
The microwave on-wafer 
S-parameter measurements have also 
been conducted from 0.5 to 40 GHz in a 
common-source configuration, by using 
the HP-8510B network analyzer. The the 
unity current gain cut-off frequency (ft) 
and the maximum oscillation frequency 
(fmax) performances at VDS = 2V have 
been indicated in Fig. 5 (a) at room 
temperature. The higher ft (fmax) are 57 
(68.3) GHz for LGC-HEMT at VGS = 0V, 
42.3 (50.9) GHz for LMC-HEMT at 
VGS= 0V and 52.9 (56.6) GHz for 
ILGC-HEMT at VGS = -0.2 V. Since the 
cutoff frequency (ft), can be 
approximated as:

where Cgs and Cgd is the capacitance of 
gate-source and gate-drain and Ri is the 
series resistance. Higher gm and lower gd 
result in better high-frequency 
performances. Higher ft and fmax 
characteristics of LGC-HEMT than 
those of ILGC-HEMT and LMC-HEMT 
are obtained due to the improved 
transport characteristics and the 
shortened separation distance of the 
2DEG population from gate electrode by 
considering the previously discussed gm 
characteristics. Fig.5 (b) shows the ft and 
fmax as a function of temperature form 
300 K to 425 K. The ft ( fmax )are 52.4 
(58.6) GHz at 425K for LGC-HEMT, 
38.9 (42.8) for LMC-HEMT and 49.9 
(51.3) for ILGC-HEMT. 
High-temperature ft performance at 425 
K maintains distinguished 94 % of that 
at 300 K of ILGC-HEMT. As illustrated 
in Fig. 5 (b), the lower degradation of ft 
and fmax with increasing temperature is 
obtained for ILGC-HEMT due to the 
better thermal stability of gm,max . 
Therefore, based on the better linearity 
and thermal stability, the ILGC-HEMT
