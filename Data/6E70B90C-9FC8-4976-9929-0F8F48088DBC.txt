1. Introduction 
An isotropic manipulator has optimum dexterity when it reaches an isotropic position, so it is 
desirable to develop manipulators that can reach more isotropic positions. With many isotropic 
positions to choose from, we can choose a preferable position (with larger or smaller singular values) 
for some specific applications. For example, an isotropic position with smaller singular values 
provides high resolution for fine position control of a manipulator.  
Many researchers have investigated how to develop isotropic manipulators over the last two 
decades, and several approaches have been proposed to obtain planar [1-2], spatial [3-4], 6-DOF 
[5-8], and redundant [9-10] isotropic manipulators. The isotropic manipulators are obtained by 
solving a system of nonlinear equations developed from the condition number (or the discriminant 
of the characteristic equation) of the Jacobian or isotropy conditions. The equations are easier to 
handle if we solve for the relative positions of joint axes and then compute the link parameters. The 
obtained isotropic design, in general, cannot reach maximum number of isotropic positions. For 3R 
planar manipulators, Kircanski [3] employed the condition number to obtain two highly nonlinear 
equations with link parameters as design variables. The two equations are manipulated into a 
fourth-degree polynomial in 3cθ  with the coefficients as functions of link lengths 1 2,a a , and 3a , 
and the polynomial is used to determine the ranges of link lengths with zero, four, and eight 
isotropic configurations.  
This paper presents two efficient methods for developing 4R spatial and 5R planar parallel 
manipulators. A 4R spatial manipulator that can reach eight isotropic positions is directly developed

where 1 2, ,θ θ and 3θ  are absolute joint displacements (measured from the x-axis). The 
displacements can be easily transformed to relative displacements once the isotropic configurations 
are obtained. Letting 1 0θ =  (note that the characteristics of the Jacobian are independent of 1θ ) and 
employing the isotropy condition (the rows of the Jacobian are equal in length and orthogonal), we 
obtain two nonlinear equation in 2θ  and 3θ . Next, substituting the following trigonometric 
identities:

into the obtained equations and rewriting the equations with 3t suppressed, we can obtain two 
4th-degree polynomials in 2t :

Four 3rd-degree polynomials can be developed from the two equations by (i) multiplying Eq. (3) by 
F and Eq. (4) by A, and subtracting the two equations obtained; (ii) multiplying Eq. (3) by J and Eq. 
(4) by E, subtracting the two equations, and dividing the equation obtained by 2t ; (iii) multiplying 
Eq. (3) by 2Ft G+  and Eq. (4) by 2At B+  and subtracting the two equations obtained; (iv) 
multiplying Eq. (3) by 2It J+  and Eq. (4) by 2Dt E+ , subtracting the two equations, and 
[13]. Let

vectors of the Jacobian are equal in length) and d = e = f = 0 (row vectors are orthogonal). 
Substituting a = b, a = c, and d = e = f = 0 into 2Δ  yields 2Δ  = 0. Therefore, the two equations 
from 1Δ  = 2Δ  = 0 and the five equations from the isotropy condition are equivalent. In theory, we 
have to solve five highly nonlinear equations for developing 6R manipulators. This section proposes 
an alternative approach in which the related data of planar 3R isotropic manipulators are utilized to 
develop 4R spatial manipulators. The process does not involve developing and solving nonlinear 
equations. 
For the 3R manipulator shown in Fig. 4a with 1θ ′  = 0, the coordinates of point E can be 
obtained by

If the 2×3 Jacobian ′J (of the manipulator in Fig. 4a) satisfies the isotropy condition, then the three 
row vectors of J are orthogonal, and the first two rows are equal in length. Matrix J will satisfy the 
isotropy condition if the absolute value of Ex  (denoted by Ex ) equals to the row vector norm S 
of ′J . Since Ex  represents the distance from point E to the y-axis, we have

aα −=                                       (9) 
 
where α  is the angle between BE and the x-axis. If the following condition 
 
1S BE S BEa+ > > −                                    (10) 
 
is satisfied, then two different solutions of α  can be obtained from Eq. (9), and the related 2θ  
can be determined by 2θ α σ= − . Therefore, two isotropic configurations can be generated from 
one isotropic configuration of the 3R manipulator (that consists of the last three links of the 4R 
spatial manipulator). If we can find a link length of 1a  that satisfies the inequality for four pairs of 
( )BE , S  related to the eight isotropic configurations of a 3R manipulator, then the obtained 4R 
spatial manipulator can reach a maximum number of 16 isotropic configurations. The values of 
( )BE , S  for the eight isotropic configurations in Fig. 3 are (2.60, 2.792), (2.60, 3.546), (1.538, 
where unit vectors , ,1 2 3u u u and 4u  are perpendicular to vectors AE, BE, DE and CE respectively.

Both singular values of the Jacobian J are equal to d . Therefore, a 5R planar parallel manipulator is 
at an isotropic configuration if L1 is perpendicular to L2 and 1d = 2d .  
To obtain an isotropic design, we can fix the angle between EB and EC at90o . In this case, a

Expanding the 2×2 coefficient matrix results in an 8th-degree polynomial in t1. The other 8th-degree 
polynomial for the configuration in Fig. 6b can be developed from Eq. (18) and Eqs. (21)- (23). 
variables of the equations presented in this work can be replaced by position variables. In this case, 
the proposed methods can be employed to develop manipulators that can reach specified isotropic 
positions.

Appendix A  
The number of real solutions of nth degree polynomial equations can be determined by the 
following theorem [13]: 
 
Sturm’s theorem : Let any two real quantities a and b be substituted for x in the series of n + 1 
functions, f x f x f x f x f x f xn n( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), , ( ) ( ),1 2 3 1"" − and  consisting of the given 
polynomial f x( ) , its first derivative f x1( ) , and the successive remainders (with their signs changed) 
in the process of finding the greatest common measures of f x( ) and f x1( ) . Then the difference 
between the number of changes of sign in the series when p is substituted for x and the number 
when q is substituted for x expresses exactly the number of real roots of the equation f x( ) = 0 
between p and q. 
 
The mode of formation of Sturm’s functions supplies the following series of equations, in which 
q q qn1 2 1, ," −  represent the successive quotients in the operation: 
1 1 2( ) ( ) ( )f x q f x f x= −  
functions.
