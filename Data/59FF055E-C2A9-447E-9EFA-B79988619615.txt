where the renormalized energy levels of QDs are 1=E1

hopping terms are time dependent, Vk,1t=Vk,1 expi/2t and
Vk,j=2,3t=Vk,j expâˆ’i/2t, in which the energy and time de-
pendence of the coupling are factorized. This factorization
leads to time-independent tunneling rates. Even though the
effect of electron correlation is significant in small semicon-
ductor QDs, we can ignore the particle Coulomb interaction
if the applied voltage is not sufficient to overcome the charg-
ing energies of the QDs.6 Such a condition is assumed
throughout this paper.

include the tunneling rate as a function of energy and mo-
mentum, and we assume that these tunneling rates are energy
and bias independent even though 12 can be calculated
with a reliable method.23 Particularly important for the three-
level system is the complex self-energy of 2,3 representing
the coherent, nonradiative coupling between the two excited
states through the continuum. Such self-energy, defined as
= k,Vk,2,Vk,3, / âˆ’k=d+ ii, arises from the fact
that both levels couple to the same continuum. The d and i
denote the real and imaginary parts of self-energy 23 lead-
ing to quantum interference or Fano interference.24 Such
interference is negligible as the energy level separation
E=E3âˆ’E2 is large. Note that we ignored the coupling be-
tween E2 and E3 arising from the effects of electron-phonon
interactions. Although the electron-phonon scattering rate
can be small or vanishing within QDs due to the phonon
bottleneck effect25 inability to satisfy the energy conserva-
tion between discrete QD levels, it can be enhanced due to
phonon assisted tunneling since the energy conservation can
be met by electron jumping between the QD and the leads.26
To suppress such an effect, a low temperature is considered
in this study.

between two peaks, but constructive in the wings of the two
absorption lines. This EIT effect can be used to efficiently
modulate the light group velocity or stop light17,29 as a
result of the very small broadening of energy levels of QDs.

an isolated QD system, whereas it was reported in the quan-

Va=165 mV and temperature kBT=1 meV in Fig. 4: the
solid line and dashed line denote, respectively, k2,3= âˆ’0.5

shown in Fig. 3, we see two asymmetric lines resulting from
the real part of 2,3, which were ignored in the absorption
spectrum. In addition to the destructive interference between
two peaks, the constructive interference is also observed in
the wings of these two peaks. This feature is the same as that
of the absorption spectrum. We also observe the intensity
enhancement of L1. The high emission rate of SPS is impor-
tant in the application of quantum cryptography, therefore
the Fano interference can be utilized to increase the emission
efficiency of L1124 meV.
In Figs. 3 and 4 we focused on low temperatures. It is
important to provide single-photon sources with strong
temperature stability in the application of quantum cryptog-
raphy. Therefore, it is worth understanding the temperature
effect on the emission spectrum. We show the imaginary part
of Xe for different temperatures using the applied bias

the dash-dotted line kBT=4 meV. When the applied voltage
is Va=165 mV, the left electrode supplies maximum electron
number into two resonant levels E2 and E3 at zero tempera-
ture. Consequently, L1 and L2 exhibit the strongest intensities

III. FORMALISM
Although the spontaneous emission process of photons is
a quantum effect of the electromagnetic field,8 the electro-
magnetic field is still treated as a semiclassical field in Eq.
1. The approach detailed in Ref. 11 is employed to study
the spontaneous emission process of photons. The optical
susceptibility of QDs not only provides the absorption coef-
ficient and the refractive index, but also determines the spon-
taneous emission rate.11 Therefore, the optical susceptibility
of individual QDs is calculated using the lesser Greenâ€™s func-
tion defined as G,j
 t , t= id
â€ tdjt. Based on Keldyshâ€™s
equation, we have
G,j
 t,t = dt1 dt2G,nr t,t1n,m t1,t2Gm,ja t2,t , 3
where n,m

, G,n
r
, and Gm,j
a are the lesser self-energy, the
retarded Greenâ€™s function, and the advanced Greenâ€™s func-
tion, respectively. The Einstein summation index is used in
Eq. 3. The spontaneous emission rate will be suppressed if
the tunneling rates 2 and 1 are smaller than the spontane-
ous emission rate Reh. The detailed expression of Reh is given
later. To avoid the suppression of the spontaneous emission
rate, the device shown in Fig. 1 favors the condition of
21	Reh or 12	Reh to function as a light-emitting
source. The condition of 21	Reh ,,j will be regarded
as a small parameter in the comparison with tk,. Conse-
quently, the lesser self-energy of Eq. 3 is mainly attributed
to tunneling:

The time-dependent tunneling current associated with the

is next discussed based on Eqs. 15, 18, and 19.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Because of current conservation, the time-dependent tun-
neling current is given by Jt=Jspt=est, where st
denotes the time-dependent spontaneous emission rate. Ow-
ing to small tunneling rates e /EF,e1 and h /EF,h1,
Eq. 15 can be reduced to
Jspt = 2eRehfeTNhT,t , 20
with
Nht = d

r  , t2=âˆ’2 ImAhh
r  , t	âˆ’dAhh
r  , t2 /dt resulting
from total charge conservation and gauge invariance.16 In
Eq. 20 we define the time-independent spontaneous emis-
sion rate Reh=ex
3
, where ex=Eg+Ee+Ehâˆ’Ueh. According
to Eq. 20, the time-dependent feature of Jspt is deter-
mined by the hole occupation number of Eq. 21.
To reveal the time-dependent behavior of Jspt, Eq. 20
is solved numerically, and shows Jspt for various duration
times at zero temperature in Fig. 2 for the tunneling rate
h=0.5 meV and =20 meV; the solid line for s= t0, the
dashed line for s=3t0, and the dotted line for s=5t0. The
current almost reaches saturation at t=5t0. Apart from the
classical capacitive charging and discharging behavior ex-
ponential growth and decay,17 tunneling oscillations are su-
perimposed on the tunneling current not only for ts but
also for ts. However, the amplitude of oscillation for t
s is small. In particular, the oscillation period for ts
does not depend on the magnitude of the duration time. The
oscillatory current is given by the particle coherent tunneling
between the electrodes and the QD. Such coherent tunneling
was also pointed out as the mechanism of quantum ringing
for the electron tunneling current through a single dot em-
bedded in an n-i-n structure.18 In Ref. 18 oscillatory current
was not observed as ts. According to the result of quan-
tum interference between the outgoing wave leaving the
QDs and the wave reflected from the barrier, this oscillatory
behavior could be observed in the discharging process.19
To examine if the oscillation currents shown in Fig. 2
depend on the applied bias strength, Fig. 3 illustrates Jspt
for different applied biases with duration time s=3t0 at zero
temperature and h=0.5 meV. The solid line denotes 
=15 meV, and the dashed and dotted lines denote =20 and
25 meV, respectively. For amplitude =15 meV, the Fermi
energy of the right electrode just reaches alignment with the
resonant exciton level. Jspt displays a strong oscillation
characteristic. If the pulse amplitude is increased to 
=20 meV, the resonant exciton level is covered by the right
electrode reservoir, and therefore the magnitude of Jspt in-
creases. When the pulse amplitude is increased to 
=25 meV, Jspt becomes saturated. The results shown in
Fig. 3 clearly indicate that the oscillation feature of Jspt
depends on the magnitude of . Because the number of emit-
ted photons is in proportion to Jspt, the features of the
emitted photon numbers as functions of time will correspond
to the results shown in Fig. 3.
In Figs. 2 and 3 the hole tunneling rate is set as h
=0.5 meV; it is interesting to understand how the tunneling
rate influences Jspt. Jspt for different hole tunneling rates
is shown in Fig. 4; the solid line for h=0.5 meV, the dashed
line for h=0.75 meV, and the dotted line for h=1 meV.
On increasing the tunneling rate, Jspt reaches exponential
growth quickly. This also indicates that electrically driven
SPSs can quickly reach the maximum photon emission effi-
ciency within a shorter operating time compared to optically
driven SPSs with a phonon bottleneck. To clarify, the relation
between the photon number Nst and Jspt should be con-
structed. Because dNst /dt=spt, the time-dependent pho-
ton number Nst=0t dt spt is obtained. For a steplike

Current is given in units of J0=2eReh, where Reh denotes the time-
and temperature-independent spontaneous emission rate, and time is
in units of t0= /meV.
