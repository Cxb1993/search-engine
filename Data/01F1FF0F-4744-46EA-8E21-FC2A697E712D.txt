 
In this paper, Chi and Chen’s computationally efficient fast kurtosis maximization algorithm (FKMA) for 
blind source separation is applied to blind multiuser detection (BMD) for asynchronous multi-rate (variable 
processing gain or multi-code) DS/CDMA systems. The proposed blind multi-user detection algorithm, 
referred to as the BMD-FKMA, enjoys the fast convergence rate and computational efficiency of the 
FKMA. Furthermore, the BMD-FKMA in conjunction with the blind maximum ratio combining algorithm 
proposed by Chi et al. is considered for multi-rate DS/CDMA systems equipped with multiple receive 
antennas. Finally, some simulation results are provided to support the efficacy of the proposed 
BMD-FKMA and the performance as well as complexity improvements over some existing algorithms.

Chi et at. proposed a computationally efficient fast kurtosis maximization algorithm for blind equalization 
of multiple-input multiple-output linear time-invariant systems. This algorithm is also an iterative batch 
processing algorithm and has been applied to blind source separation. This paper considers blind 
beamforming of multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Assuming that the 
channel is static within one OFDM block, a blind post-FFT multistage beamforming algorithm (MSBFA) 
based on subcarrier averaging is proposed. The algorithm basically comprises: i) source (path signal) 
extraction using a hybrid beamforming algorithm composed of a Fourier beamformer and a kurtosis 
maximization beamformer, ii) time delay estimation and compensation, iii) classification (path-to-user 
association) and blind maximum ratio combining (of path signals). The designed beamformer is exactly the 
same for all the subcarriers, effectively utilizes multipath diversity for performance gain, and works well 
even in an environment with spatially correlated sources. Some simulation results are presented to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MSBFA.

In this paper, a block-by-block blind channel estimation algorithm is proposed for a multiuser orthogonal

channel), based on the subcarrier averaging the proposed channel estimation algorithm can estimate all the 
channel parameters (directions of arrival, time delays and multipath gains of all the users) within only one 
OFDM block. Some simulation results are provided to justify the efficacy of the proposed channel 
estimation algorithm even when the total number of subcarriers is not very large.

ABSTRACT
A cross-layered slotted ALOHA protocol is proposed for distrib-
uted estimation in sensor networks. Suppose that the sensors in
the network record local measurements of a common event and re-
port the data back to the fusion center through direct transmission
links. We employ a channel-aware transmission control where the
transmission probability of each sensor depends on the quality of
the local observation and the conditions of the transmission chan-
nel in each time slot. In contrast to conventional ALOHA systems,
our goal is to minimize the accumulated estimation error at each in-
stant in time as opposed to maximizing the system throughput. We
show that the transmission probability which achieves the maximum
throughput does not provide the best solution to the distributed esti-
mation problem. Two strategies are proposed: the maximum mean-
square-error (MSE) reduction (MMR) method and the suboptimal
two-mode MSE-reduction method. The first scheme maximizes the
reduction in MSE for each transmission but requires the information
of the number of active sensors and the accumulated estimation ac-
curacy before each time slot. In the second scheme, the sensors uti-
lize the interchange between two fixed transmission control policies
without the explicit knowledge of the system parameters required in
the first scheme.

1. INTRODUCTION
Wireless sensor networks consist of a large number of miniature de-
vices that have the ability to sense, to compute and to communicate.
The sensors in these systems are linked through a common appli-
cation and work cooperatively towards a common goal. With strict
energy and bandwidth constraints, it is necessary to exploit the coop-
erative nature of the sensors to improve the efficiency of the commu-
nication [1]. Distributed estimation is a problem often encountered
in sensor networks, such as localization or temperature estimation
etc. In this system, the sensors record local measurements of a com-
mon event and report the data back to a centralized fusion center
where a global estimate of the event is computed.
The goal of this work is to devise a random access protocol that
allows the fusion center to efficiently retrieve the data from the sen-
sors and to rapidly improve the estimate of the event. Specifically,
we propose a cross-layered channel-aware slotted ALOHA protocol
where the transmission probability of each sensor is assigned ac-
cording to the reliability of the local observation and the quality of

der the grants NSC-95-2221-E-007-043-MY3 and NSC-95-2219-E-007-010.
the channel towards the destination. The channel-aware transmis-
sion control was previously studied in [2, 3] to maximize the sys-
tem throughput in the slotted ALOHA network. However, in the
distributed estimation problem, the sensors are transmitting infor-
mation about a common event and the goal is to obtain an accurate
estimate, instead of maximizing the throughput. In fact, the conven-
tional method that maximizes the throughput may not necessarily
lead to an accurate estimate at each time instant since the observa-
tions that go through the channel may be unreliable.
In this work, we adopt the distributed estimation model studied
in [4] where each sensor transmits an amplified version of its ana-
log measurements to the fusion center. This system model is similar
to the amplify-and-forward (AF) cooperative transmission scheme
as described in [5]. Based on this model and given a fixed set of
transmission probabilities, we first compute the expressions for the
mean-square-error (MSE) distortion of the estimate. The channel-
aware transmission probability for the slotted ALOHA system is
then derived to maximize the MSE-reduction after each transmis-
sion. This strategy is referred to as the maximum MSE-reduction
(MMR) method. Two transmission schemes are studied: the re-
peated transmission (RT) scheme and the transmit once (TO) scheme.
In the MMR, the number of active sensors and the accumu-
lated estimation performance (i.e., MSE) before each time slot must
be available to the sensors. However, this may not be achievable
in practice. Therefore, we propose a suboptimal two-mode MSE-
reduction (TMMR) method that utilizes the interchange of two fixed
channel-aware policies to approximate the performance of MMR
without the exact knowledge of the aforementioned system parame-
ters. The channel-aware policies are in the form of a thresholding
function where a sensor transmits if and only if the local channel
condition meets the desired criterion. The TMMR method is shown
to closely approximate the performance of the MMR method even
without the information of the number of active sensors and the ac-
cumulated estimation accuracy before each transmission. Both of
the proposed strategies are shown to outperform the one with no
channel-aware transmission controls in terms of the MSE estimation
performance.
Due to the similarities of the system models, the strategies stud-
ied in this paper can be applied to cooperative random access com-
munication systems that consist of one source and multiple relays.
The similarities between these two problems are discussed in [5].
2. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a wireless sensor network with N sensors, denoted by the
set S = {1, . . . , N}, that are deployed to estimate a common pa-
rameter X . Suppose that each sensor observes a local measurement
of X and reports it to the fusion center through direct transmission

where Pk given by (4) is the probability that user k succeeds in the
time slot. By isolating the terms relevant to sensor i, we have from
(7) that
MSE(p) = pi

The above equation is linear with respect to pi. When sensor i
knows δk and pk for all k, the optimal choice of pi which mini-
mizes MSE(p) is equal to 1 if the slope with respect to pi is positive
and it is equal to 0 if the slope is negative.
Unfortunately, the sensors do not have access to the CSI of other
sensors and, therefore, each sensor can only minimize the MSE aver-
aged over the SNR of other sensors, i.e., δk for all k = i are averaged
out when determining pi. Hence, we have
MSE(pi) = E[(X − Xˆ)2|δT , δi]

for all k. Note that γ is the amount of average MSE-reduction after
sensor k transmits, and (8) follows from the fact that δks are i.i.d. for
all k. Similarly, pi is determined according to the slope of MSE(pi)
given by (8) which leads to the solution that
pi = g(δi, δT ) =

This shows that, to maximize the reduction in the MSE after each
time slot, each user should adopt a transmission control that is equiv-
alent to a thresholding function where the sensor transmits with prob-
ability 1 if and only if the SNR contribution exceeds a certain thresh-
old. This result is rather intuitive and is consistent with the transmis-
sion control policies derived in [2, 3] for different applications.

Let Fδ and fδ be the distribution function and the probability
density function of δi for all i, respectively. From (10), the average
transmission probability can be written as

Substituting (13) and (14) into (11), we can then solve for the value
of β. However, the equation is highly nonlinear in general and must
be solved numerically.
Let us consider the case where δi for all i is exponential distrib-
uted with mean θ. In this case, the average transmission probability
p¯ = 1− Fδ(β) = e−β/θ (15)

We can then solve for β by substituting these into (11). The nu-
merically evaluated solution is shown in Fig. 1 (solid line). We can
see that β is monotonically increasing and are bounded between two
values. The bounds are derived as follows.
Let us consider two cases: (1) δT = 0 and (2) δT  max{θ, β}.
The first case occurs at the beginning of the process while the second
case occurs after a large number of time slots. Since β is monotoni-
cally increasing with respect to δT , we shall derive the lower bound
on β for the first case and an upper bound for the second case given
by

5. PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS AND NUMERICAL
SIMULATIONS
In this section, we compare the estimation performance of the pro-
posed strategies with the conventional slotted ALOHA system, where
pi[m] is equal to 1/N , for all i and m, regardless of the CSI.
Consider a network with N = 20 sensors and let δi[m] be i.i.d.
exponentially distributed with mean θ = 5. The random variable
X is Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 1. In Figs. 2 and 3, we
show the MSE performance of the RT and the TO schemes, respec-
tively. Each result shown in the figures was obtained from the aver-
age of 1500 independent trials. The optimal scheduling is given as a
lower bound to the achievable performance. In the case of schedul-
ing, we assume that a genie assigns the transmission probability 1 to
the sensor if it has the highest SNR among all sensors, and assigns
the probability 0, otherwise. One can observe from Figs. 2 and 3 that
both the MMR and the TMMR methods significantly outperform the
strategy without channel-aware transmission control, but lose to the
optimal scheduling due to the lack of centralized control.
In the RT scheme shown in Fig. 2, the TMMR method is shown
to closely approximate the performance of the MMR, even though
N and δT [m] are not explicitly known. However, in the TO scheme
shown in Fig. 3, the MMR outperforms the TMMR since the esti-
mate on N [m] may not be very accurate for the latter. Specifically,
in TMMR, the threshold β is often underestimated in the early stages
and, thus, increases the amount of transmissions that result in colli-
sion. Due to this reason, fewer sensors remain active in later time
slots and, thereby, limits the MSE performance for the suboptimal
method. Moreover, the average MSE saturates at some time slot in

due to the fact that eventually all the sensors would have transmitted
and the MSE will remain unchanged thereafter.
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the performance of the distributed estima-
tion problem in a cooperative slotted ALOHA system with channel-
aware sensors. It is shown that the transmission probability assign-
ment that results in maximal throughput does not yield desirable es-
timation performance. In fact, by exploiting the channel informa-
tion, one can achieve a lower distortion at a faster rate. The MMR
and the suboptimal TMMR are proposed to implement the channel-
aware transmission control. The latter scheme achieves a reason-
ably good performance even without the knowledge of the number
of active sensors and the accumulated estimation performance before
each transmission.

Lp : total number of paths (or DOAs) of user p.
The channel is considered invariant within one OFDM block,
i.e., each path gain
αp,l = |αp,l|ejψp,l (2)
is constant within one block, and so are θp,l and τp,l. Assume
that the receiver at the base station is equipped with a uniform
linear antenna array of Q elements equally spaced by half a
carrier wavelength. The received signal can be expressed as
x[n] =
P∑
p=1
Lp∑
l=1
αp,la(θp,l)sp[n− τp,l] +w[n], (3)
n = −Ng, ..., N − 1, where w[n] is a Q× 1 noise vector and
a(θp,l) = [1, ejpi sin(θp,l), ..., ejpi(Q−1) sin(θp,l)]T (4)
is the steering vector of the lth path of user p.
Next, let us make some assumptions about the MIMO
channel model given by (3) as follows:
(A1) u1[k], u2[k], . . . , uP [k] are independent identically dis-
tributed (i.i.d.) quadriphase-shift keying (QPSK) sym-
bol sequences (i.e., up[k] ∈ {1,−1, j,−j}), and uq[k]
is statistically independent of up[k] for all q 6= p.
(A2) θq,m 6= θp,l for all (q,m) 6= (p, l); L = L1 + ...+ LP
(total number of paths of all the users) and Q > L.
(A3) τp,l ∈ {0, 1, ..., Ng} for all l and p (quasi-synchronous
OFDM system) and τp,1 < τp,2 < ... < τp,Lp .
(A4) w[n] is zero-mean Gaussian with E{w[n]wH[n]} =
σ2wIQ, and is statistically independent of up[k], p = 1,
2, ..., P , where IQ is a Q×Q identity matrix.
After the processes of the removal of GI, S/P conversion,
N -point FFT operation, and P/S conversion at each receive
antenna, the received signal at each subcarrier k can be ex-
pressed as:
x[k] =
P∑
p=1
Lp∑
l=1
αp,la(θp,l)up[k]e−j2pikτp,l/N +w[k]
= A(k)u(k) +w[k], k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, (5)
where w[k] is also a Q× 1 white Gaussian noise vector,
u(k) = (u1[k], u2[k], ..., uP [k])T ∈ CP×1, (6)
A(k) = (a(k)1 ,a
(k)
2 , ...,a
(k)
P ) ∈ CQ×P , (7)
and each column of A(k) is given by
a(k)p =
Lp∑
l=1
αp,la(θp,l)e−j2pikτp,l/N . (8)
Like the semi blind channel estimation method in the subcar-
rier domain [7], our objective is also to estimate the matrix
A(k) for all the N subcarriers, but blindly. It should be noted
that in the post-FFT MIMO model given by (5), the mix-
ing matrix A(k) is a function of subcarrier index k, implying
that a distinct blind channel estimator for each subcarrier is
needed, thus leading to a large computational load. Alterna-
tively, the MIMO signal model in (5) can also be re-expressed
as follows:
x[k] = Au[k] +w[k], k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, (9)
where A and u[k] are defined as follows:
A = (A1, ...,AP ) ∈ CQ×L, (10)
Ap = (αp,1a(θp,1), ..., αp,Lpa(θp,Lp)) ∈ CQ×Lp , (11)
u[k] = (uT1 [k],u
T
2 [k], ...,u
T
P [k])
T ∈ CL, (12)
up[k] = (up,1[k], up,2[k], ..., up,Lp [k])
T ∈ CLp , (13)
up,l[k] = up[k]e−j2pikτp,l/N . (14)
Based on the MIMO signal model (9), the proposed blind
channel estimator (not dependent on k) is to estimate the mix-
ing matrixA and all the time delays τp,l from which the chan-
nel estimate of A(k) can be obtained straightforwardly by (7)
and (8).
3. PROPOSED BLIND CHANNEL ESTIMATION
ALGORITHM
The proposed blind channel estimation algorithm is based on
the subcarrier averaging [8] over one OFDM block. Specifi-
cally, let
〈up,l[k]〉 , 1
N
N−1∑
k=0
up,l[k] (15)
denote the subcarrier average of up,l[k]. It can be observed,
from the source vector u[k] of (12), that up,l[k], l = 1, 2, ...,
Lp are correlated with each other since
E{up,i[k]u∗p,j [k]} = e−j2pik(τp,i−τp,j)/N 6= 0
for all i 6= j (by (14)).
Let
Ru , 〈u[k]uH[k]〉 (16)
denote the subcarrier average based correlation matrix ofu[k].
All the components of u[k] become uncorrelated by subcar-
rier averaging as stated in the following lemma:
Lemma 1. Under the assumptions (A1) and (A3), Ru
p−→
IL, where
p−→ denotes “convergence in probability” as N →
∞.
The proof of Lemma 1 is omitted due to page limit. Sim-
ilarly, the subcarrier average based correlation matrix of the
received signal x[k] can be easily seen to be
Rx = A〈u[k]uH[k]〉AH + 〈w[k]wH[k]〉
p−→ AAH + σ2wIQ. (by (9) and Lemma 1) (17)
is the normalized correlation coefficient between y(r)c [k] and
gp[k]. Note that ρ itself is complex and |ρ| ≤ 1.
At the end of stage p, by (27) and (29) the obtained Gp
turns out to be a set of all the path signals associated with
“user p”, i.e.,
Gp = {yp,l[k] | yp,l[k] = αp,lup[k], l = 1, 2, ..., Lp } , (31)
where p = 1, 2, ..., P and each p uniquely maps to a true user
number p′ and vice versa (i.e., user permutation ambiguity).
3.5. Path Gain Estimation
In this subsection, we present how to estimate the complex
path gain αp,l for each path signal of Gp. The path gain esti-
mation can be separated into two parts: magnitude estimation
and phase estimation of path gain.
3.5.1. Magnitude Estimation of Path Gain
Because up[k] is QPSK by (A1), it can be easily shown that〈
(yp,l[k])
4
〉
= (αp,l)
4 = |αp,l|4ej4ψp,l , (32)
where ψp,l is the phase of αp,l (see (2)). Therefore,〈
(yp,l[k])
4
〉1/4
=
∣∣∣〈(yp,l[k])4〉∣∣∣1/4 ejψ(i)p,l , (33)
where
ψ
(i)
p,l = ψp,l + (pi/2)i, i = 1, ..., 4. (34)
By (32) and (33), the path gain magnitude estimate can be
obtained as
|α̂p,l| =
∣∣∣∣〈(yp,l[k])4〉1/4∣∣∣∣ . (35)
3.5.2. Phase Estimation of Path Gain
As any other blind channel estimation algorithms, the pro-
posed blind channel estimation algorithm can only provide
the path phase estimates
ψ̂p,l = ψp,l + ϕp, l = 1, 2, ..., Lp, (36)
(i.e., the same phase ambiguity for all the Lp paths) simply
because each column a(k)p of A(k) associated with a up[k]
(see (8)) can only be estimated up to a phase ambiguity (i.e.,
â(k)p = a
(k)
p ejϕp). Therefore, by (36) and (31), it can be
easily seen that for all yp,l[k] ∈ Gp,
y′p,l[k] , yp,l[k]e−j
bψp,l = |αp,l|e−jϕpup[k], (37)
for which the equivalent path gains |αp,l|e−jϕp for all l have
the same phase −ϕp, implying that
ρ(y′p,l[k], y
′
p,m[k]) = 1 ∀ l andm. (38)
Based on (38) and (34), the following procedure is pro-
posed to determine ψ̂p,l from {ψ(i)p,l , i = 1, ..., 4}, l = 1, 2,
..., Lp.
Step P-1: Determine ψ̂p,1 by choosing an arbitrary member
of {ψ(i)p,1, i = 1, ..., 4}. Then obtain
y′p,1[k] = yp,1[k]e
−j bψp,l = |αp,1|up[k]e−jϕp , (39)
where ϕp ∈ {0,±pi/2, pi}.
Step P-2: For l = 2, ...,Lp, obtain y
(i)
p,l [k] = yp,l[k]e
−jψ(i)p,l
based on (37), and then compute
ρ(i) = ρ(y(i)p,l [k], y
′
p,1[k]), i = 1, ..., 4. (40)
Obtain ψ̂p,l = ψ
(m)
p,l where m = argmin1≤i≤4
∣∣ρ(i) − 1∣∣.
With the obtained estimates (φ̂(r), τ̂ (r)), r = 1, ..., L pre-
sented in Sections 3.1 and 3.3, one can easily retrieve the as-
sociated (θ̂p,l, τ̂p,l), p = 1, ...,P , l = 1, ..., Lp through the
one-to-one mapping between r and (p, l). Substituting the ob-
tained estimates (θ̂p,l, τ̂p,l) as well as the obtained estimates
α̂p,l presented in Section 3.5 into (8) and (7) yields
Â(k) = A(k)ΛP, (41)
where P is a P × P permutation matrix and
Λ = diag(ejϕ1 , ..., ejϕP ). (42)
Note that both the permutation matrix P and the phase ambi-
guity matrix Λ are the same for all k = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, and
they can be eliminated by use of only one pilot subcarrier for
each user within one OFDM block.
4. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section some simulation results are presented to demon-
strate the efficacy of the proposed blind channel estimation
algorithm. Consider a two-user (P = 2) OFDM system with
system parameters N ∈ {64, 256, 1024}, Ng = 20 and Q =
10. The total number of paths for each user is Lp = 3, and
thus L = L1 + L2 = 6; path gains αp,l are zero-mean com-
plex Gaussian (i.e., Rayleigh fading); time delays τp,l are
uniformly distributed over {0, 1, ..., Ng}; DOA θp,l are uni-
formly distributed over (−pi/2, pi/2].
For each simulated value of Input SNR defined as
Input SNR =

ABSTRACT
This paper considers blind beamforming of multiuser orthogonal fre-
quency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Assuming that the
channel is static within one OFDM block, a blind post-FFT multi-
stage beamforming algorithm (MSBFA) based on subcarrier averag-
ing over one OFDM block is proposed, which basically comprises: i)
source (path) extraction using a hybrid beamforming algorithm com-
posed of a Fourier beamformer and a kurtosis maximization beam-
former, ii) time delay estimation and compensation, iii) classifica-
tion (path-to-user association) and blind maximum ratio combining
(of paths). The designed beamformer effectively utilizes multipath
diversity for performance gain, and is robust against the effects of
correlated sources. Some simulation results are presented to demon-
strate the effectiveness of the proposed MSBFA.
1. INTRODUCTION
The need for high transmission rate and guaranteed quality of ser-
vice has grown rapidly in wireless communication systems. To meet
this need, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in
conjunction with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal pro-
cessing has been considered for broadband communications, espe-
cially in the beamforming design of the receiver, such as the pre-FFT
beamforming structure (pre-FFT BFS) and post-FFT beamforming
structure (post-FFT BFS) [1–3]. The nonblind minimum mean square
error (MMSE) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) beamformers
require the channel information estimated in advance through the use
of pilot signals resulting in reduced spectral efficiency. Thus, blind
beamforming algorithms without pilot signals are preferable [2, 4].
Some blind beamforming algorithms associated with the post-
FFT BFS have been reported such as the subspace-based method
proposed by Zeng and Ng [4] and the conventional fast kurtosis max-
imization algorithm (FKMA) proposed by Chi et al. [5,6]. However,
they require a set of N beamformers (where N is the total number
of subcarriers) each for a subcarrier and the channel to be static over
multiple OFDM blocks. Recently, Peng et al. [2] proposed a single-
user blind beamforming algorithm by kurtosis maximization based
on subcarrier averaging over one OFDM block associated with the
post-FFT BFS to combat co-channel interference, where the desired
signals are significantly stronger than the interfering signals, under
a channel condition of no correlated sources. Moreover, users’ data
sequences must be independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary
phase-shift keying (BPSK) symbol sequences.
Our work can be regarded as a multiuser generalization of [2]
provided that the carrier frequency synchronization is perfect. We

Grants NSC 95-2218-E-007-110 and NSC 95-2219-E-007-004.
propose a novel block-by-block blind beamforming algorithm asso-
ciated with the post-FFT BFS for multiuser OFDM systems based on
subcarrier averaging. The designed beamformer is exactly the same
for all the subcarriers, is applicable to both the BPSK case and the
quadriphase-shift keying (QPSK) case, effectively utilizes multipath
diversity for performance gain, and is also robust against the effects
of correlated sources.
2. MIMO MODELS
Consider the uplink of a quasi-synchronous multiuser OFDM sys-
tem [4] with P active users where each mobile unit has a single
transmit antenna and the base station is equipped with a uniform
linear array of Q elements equally spaced by half a carrier wave-
length of the radio. The baseband discrete-time transmitted OFDM
signal from user p after serial-to-parallel (S/P) conversion, N -point
IFFT operation, parallel-to-serial (P/S) conversion, and insertion of
a guard interval (GI) of length equal to Ng (< N/2) is known to be
sp[n] =
1
N
N−1X
k=0
up[k]e
j2pikn/N (1)
for n = −Ng, ..., N − 1, where up[k] is the data sequence of user
p. For ease of later use, let us define the following notations:
θp,l : direction of arrival (DOA) of the lth path of user p
a(θp,l) : Q× 1 steering vector of user p with DOA θp,l
αp,l : path gain of user p with DOA θp,l
τp,l : time delay (in samples) of user p with DOA θp,l
Lp : total number of paths (or DOAs) of user p.
The baseband discrete-time received signal can be expressed as
x[n] =
PX
p=1
LpX
l=1
αp,la(θp,l)sp[n− τp,l] +w[n] (2)
for n = −Ng, ..., N − 1, where w[n] is a Q× 1 noise vector.
Next, let us make some general assumptions for the received
signal x[n] given by (2) as follows:
(A1) u1[k], . . . , uP [k] are i.i.d. QPSK symbol sequences, and
uq[k] is statistically independent of up[k] for q 6= p.
(A2) θq,m 6= θp,l for all (q,m) 6= (p, l); L = L1+ ...+LP (total
number of paths of all the users) and Q ≥ L.
(A3) τp,l ∈ {0, ..., Ng} for all p and l (quasi-synchronous OFDM
system) and τp,1 < ... < τp,Lp .
(A4) w[n] is zero-mean Gaussian, and is statistically independent
of up[k], p = 1, ..., P .

which is nothing but the magnitude of the normalized cross corre-
lation between a(eθ) and ba(r) and 0 ≤ ρ(a(eθ), ba(r)) ≤ 1. As
mentioned above, eθ and ba(r) are estimates of θ(r) and α(r)a(θ(r)),
respectively, implying the following remark.
Remark 4: The better the estimation accuracy of both eθ and ba(r)
(i.e., the better performance of the associated blind beamformer), the
larger the value of ρ(a(eθ), ba(r)).
Next, let us present how to extract a path signal in u[k] based
on subcarrier averaging over one OFDM block, involving a Fourier
beamformer and a kurtosis maximization beamformer (KMBF).
3.1. Fourier Beamformer by Subcarrier Averaging
The Fourier beamformer by subcarrier averaging is given by
vFB =
1√
Q
a(eθ), (23)
and its output is eFB[k] = vHFBx[k]. Then the associated channel
estimate baFB can be obtained by (21) with e[k] replaced by eFB[k]
and the corresponding blind performance index
ρFB = ρ(a(eθ), baFB). (by (22)) (24)
3.2. KMBF by Subcarrier Averaging
The kurtosis of u(i)[k] by subcarrier averaging is defined as
γ{u(i)[k]} = 〈|u(i)[k]|4〉−2(〈|u(i)[k]|2〉)2−|〈(u(i)[k])2〉|2. (25)
The objective function to be maximized for the design of the KMBF
v is defined as [2]
J(v) = J(e[k]) =
|γ{e[k]}|
(〈|e[k]|2〉)2 (26)
which is also called the magnitude of normalized kurtosis of beam-
former output e[k]. The optimum KMBF, denoted vKMBF, by max-
imizing J(v) (see (26)) is supported by Theorem 1 below for which
three more assumptions are needed as follows:
(A5) τp,j 6= (τp,i + τp,l)/2, ∀ p, if Lp ≥ 3, where i, j, l are
distinct integers.
(A6) τp,i+ τp,l 6= τp,j + τp,m, ∀ p, if Lp ≥ 4, where i, j, l, m are
distinct integers.
(A7) |τp,j − τp,i| 6= |τq,m − τq,l|, ∀ p 6= q, j 6= i, and m 6= l, if
Lp ≥ 2 and Lq ≥ 2.
Theorem 1. Under the assumptions (A1) through (A3), (A5) through
(A7), and the noise-free assumption, J(vKMBF) = max{J(v)}
p−→ 1, vKMBF p−→ bv, and bvHx[k] = β(r)u(r)[k] where β(r) 6= 0
is an unknown constant and r ∈ {1, ..., L} is an unknown integer.
The proof of Theorem 1 is also omitted due to page limit. Al-
though the objective function J(v) given by (26) is a highly nonlin-
ear function of v without closed-form solutions, fortunately, the op-
timum vKMBF, and eKMBF[k] = vHKMBFx[k] can be efficiently ob-
tained through the same fashion of the conventional iterative FKMA
[5, 6] (simply with ensemble averages replaced by subcarrier aver-
ages), initialized by an initial condition v(0) = vFB. Then the as-
sociated channel estimate baKMBF can be obtained by (21) with e[k]
replaced by eKMBF[k] and the corresponding blind performance in-
dex
ρKMBF = ρ(a(eθ), baKMBF). (by (22)) (27)
3.3. Fourier-KMBF by Subcarrier Averaging
We empirically found that the KMBF performs better than the Fourier
beamformer (both based on subcarrier averaging), but the former re-
quires three extra assumptions (A5), (A6) and (A7). It may occur
that these three assumptions may not be valid all the time in prac-
tice, thus limiting the use of the KMBF. This motivates the follow-
ing two-step hybrid Fourier-KMBF which is free from these three
assumptions:
(S1) Obtain eFB[k] = vHFBx[k], baFB and ρFB as presented in
Section 3.1, and obtain eKMBF[k] = vHKMBFx[k], baKMBF
and ρKMBF as presented in Section 3.2.
(S2) Let ρmax = max{ρFB, ρKMBF}. If ρmax > η, then obtain
(e[k], ba) =  (eKMBF[k], baKMBF), if ρKMBF > ρFB
(eFB[k], baFB), if ρFB > ρKMBF,
(28)
otherwise no source (with enough power) can be extracted,
where η is a preassigned threshold.
Remark 5: This two-step Fourier-KMBF is an automatic selec-
tion scheme by the performance of the Fourier beamformer and the
KMBF by Remark 4. When any of the assumptions (A5), (A6) and
(A7) does not hold true, the selection scheme (28) will switch to the
Fourier beamformer since ρFB > ρKMBF in this case. Therefore,
the three extra assumptions (A5), (A6) and (A7) can be relaxed (i.e.,
removed).
4. PROPOSED BLIND MSBFA
Under Assumptions (A1) through (A4), the proposed blind MSBFA
basically includes source (path) extraction, time delay estimation
and compensation, classification (path-to-user association) and blind
maximum ratio combining (BMRC) (of paths) which are presented
next, respectively.
4.1. Multistage Source Extraction Using Fourier-KMBF
Assume that the source estimate e`−1[k] and the channel estimateba`−1 are obtained at stage ` − 1 and that x`−1[k] is the MIMO
signal deflated from x[k] at stage `− 1. At the `th stage,
x`[k] = x`−1[k]− ba`−1e`−1[k]. (29)
First, obtain a distinct DOA estimate eθ = bθ(r) by (19) with x[k]
replaced by x`[k], and then calculate vFB by (23). Then obtain
(e`[k], ba`) (see (28)) using the proposed Fourier-KMBF, where
e`[k] = bu(r)[k] ' β`up(r)[k]e−j2pikτ(r)/N (by (12)) (30)
in which β` is an unknown constant, r ∈ {1, ..., L} is unknown and
r maps to p(r) uniquely (by (16)). Note that x1[k] = x[k] and
the extracted source e`[k] is free from error propagation since x[k]
instead of x`[k] is processed by the Fourier-KMBF at each stage.
4.2. Time Delay Estimation and Compensation (TDEC)
The unknown time delay τ (r) in the extracted source e`[k] (see (30))
can be estimated by subcarrier averaging as
bτ (r) = arg max
0≤τ≤Ng
{φ(e`[k], ej2pikτ/N )}, (31)
