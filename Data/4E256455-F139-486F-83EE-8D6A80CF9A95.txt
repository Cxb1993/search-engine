計畫緣由與目的
台灣為 TFT-LCD 產業之重要生產據
點(Display Search, 2007)。然該產業不斷面
臨市場快速變遷的挑戰，供應鏈成員亦不
斷尋求因應之道。詹智龍 (2002) 指出隨
著 TFT-LCD 供應鏈的多階層運作，末端
的市場變化會造成上游的巨幅變動。供應
鏈波動之長鞭效應 (Bullwhip effect) 亦隨
之而生，因此造成供應鏈各階層需求與產
量的上下震動，若處理不慎將引發過多存
貨，造成巨大損失。近年來 TFT-LCD 產
業供應鏈成員卻深受資訊錯誤、價格浮
動、產能規劃不確定、需求資訊與預測不
明確、反應市場急遽變化的能力僵硬等長
鞭效應問題所苦，因而導致供需無法平
衡，導致嚴重虧損，因而企業正尋求解決
之道。

文獻探討
在不確定性因素方面，由Forrester
(1961) 所提出的概念為指在一個系統的
某一端若發生了小幅變動，透過整個系統
的加乘作用，會對另一端發生極大的影
響，因而造成需求放大的現象。 Lee et al.
(1997) 針對寶鹼企業 (P＆G) 進行個案
研究，並歸納以往的文獻指出，長鞭效應
產生的原因有下列四個因素：以傳統存貨
管理面的因素來看：需求預測因素、批量
訂購；從供應鏈成員對市場力量的反應來
看：價格波動、配給與賽局問題。
Towill (1991) 將長鞭效應稱之為動
態的供應鏈，在成本的考量下，發現使用
IT 技術對長鞭效應的改善有最顯著的績
效，並且提出五種方案來解決長鞭效應的
現象：最佳的訂購參數決策、降低前置時
間、取消供應鏈的配銷商階層、各階層決
策規則改變考慮前置時間、使用 IT 技術
系統使各階層能及時了解最終顧客的需
求。
本研究特由經營管理的策略角度作為

(3) 供應鏈各階供應商不特別定訂各自之
存貨政策。
(4) 下游只能向上游訂購，不考慮跨層訂
購情形。
(5) 所有數據以100萬PCS為研究單位。

Abstract –Healthcare service industry is one of the fast
growing service sectors in Taiwan. Customer satisfaction and
patient-oriented service are becoming important issues and
playing significant roles on establishing sustainable
strategies. Due to lack of a systematically effective method of
identifying patients’ needs and voice, in this paper, we
present an integrated methodology of Kano model and
Quality Function Development (QFD). Firstly, Kano model
is applied to identify customer needs, and calculate customer
satisfaction coefficient that helps the manager to prioritize
the importance of service qualities that can increase
customer satisfaction. Then, by following the same
procedures for product design the four phases of QFD are
used to translate the voice of the patients’ needs into the 
regular service planning. With this methodology, managers
can straightforwardly identify and prioritize what customers
need. The steps described here are practical procedures for
improving and upgrading healthcare service. Furthermore,
the results can facilitate the managers to develop sustainable
strategies.
Keywords -Kano, QFD, healthcare service, quality
I. INTRODUCTION
Patient-oriented service is the core value of
healthcare business. Hospitals not only provide
medical care but also need to pay attention to
the issues of increasing customer satisfaction.
For example, patients may satisfy with the
surgical procedures, but they may not think the
communication and friendliness of the care
service is poor. If the physicians can pay more
attention to the voice of patients, then
misunderstanding of patients will be eliminated.
The managers need to find out why the medical
service is good, but the hospital still can not
make the customers satisfied. Therefore, for
better understanding what patients’needs and
how to increase their satisfaction, the managers
need to think from the customer’s point of vie.
In Taiwan, many hospitals have
implemented quality improvement initiatives
such as TQM (Total Quality Management),
QCC (Quality Control Circle), 5S, BPR
(Business Process Reengineering) etc. All
efforts are made to improve their efficiency and
service quality. Their ultimate goal is to increase
customer satisfaction and to maintain reasonable
profits. Due to lack of a systematic method to
improve customer satisfaction, the current
practice for eliminating the complaints and
dissatisfaction is a passive way. Healthcare
service is a special form of service sectors. It
includes highly intensive contact with their
customers. It differs from the other service
business. Reference 1 suggests that traditional
service evaluation method- SERVQUL is not
appropriate for healthcare service. They
proposed three quality dimensions: structure,
process, and outcome. In this study we adopted
this framework to design the questionnaire. We
provided an integration of Kano model and
Quality Function Development (QFD) to design
impressive qualities for healthcare service. Kano
model is applied to identify customer needs, and
to calculate customer satisfaction coefficient
that helps the manager to trade-off which is the
most importance quality for increasing
satisfaction. Then, four phases of quality
function development are used to translate the
voice of the customer’s needs into the regular 
service planning. With this methodology,
Managers can identify and prioritize what
customers need. There are three main objectives
of this study: (1) to adopt Reference 1
framework to construct Kano questionnaire, and
prioritize medical service quality criteria, and
calculate customer satisfaction co-efficient; (2)
An Integrated Method of Kano Model and QFD for Designing Impressive
Qualities of Healthcare Service

error questionnaires, the contradictions in
the response given from customer may
happen.
By applying Kano philosophy, customer
requirements cannot be solely taken into
account the numerical evaluation. On the
contrary, a qualitative measure from
psychological aspects is needed to analyze
customer needs. Both Reference 8 and 10 have
proposed an integration of Kano model and
QFD in meeting customer requirements.
Presently the usefulness of Kano’s model 
has barely been introduced into healthcare
service business. Reference 11 applied Kano’s 
model to explore how patient satisfaction
behaves and briefly analyzed the characteristics
and advantage of methods used to assess patient
satisfaction. They found that physician provides
the patients with written treatment and good
communication would increase patient
satisfaction. On the other hand, the absence of
the same quality attribute would lead to
dissatisfaction. This situation would be similar
to the Kano’s one-dimensional quality attributes.
Therefore, it is worth to study how to apply
Kano model to healthcare service.
C. Assess andEvaluate Customer Requirements
In the following section, we explain how
medical service requirements are identified and
classified by means of questionnaire. Then the
questionnaire results are evaluated and
interpreted and used as basis for medical service
development. The methodology to assess and
evaluate patient requirements is adopted from
Reference 8.
Step 1. Identification of medical service
requirements
The first step of constructing the Kano
questionnaire is to explore the medical service
requirements of the patients and their family.
The commonly used interview methods such as
focus group interview and individual interview
do not suffice to investigate the potential
requirements. The interviews are based on
patients’ prior experiences with service quality 
and their feeling about satisfaction. The main
focus of this research is to explore the attractive
requirements that are not explicitly expressed by
the patients. In another word, the ‘hidden’ needs 
of the patients and their family can be
ascertained. Hence, with implementation of the
attractive requirements, it is possible to increase
the level of attractive or impressive
requirements.
Step 2. Construction of Kano questionnaires
Attractive, one-dimensional, must-be,
indifference, and reverse quality requirements
can be classified by Kano model. For each
quality criterion, a pair of questions of
functional and dysfunctional form is formulated
to which the interviewee can answer in one of
five different ways [2]. One example of a pair of
questions is illustrated in Figure 1.
By combining the two answers in the Kano
evaluation table (see Table 1), the quantity
criteria can be classified into six categories:
Attractive (A), One-dimensional (O), Must-be
(M), Indifference (I), Reverse (R), and
Questionable (Q). Categories A, O, M and I are
very intuitive. Category R feature is not only
wanted by patients, but even expects the reverse.
Category Q stands for a questionable result. The
reason for questionable score might be due to
misunderstanding the questions or crossing the
wrong answers.
Step 3. Calculation of customer satisfaction
coefficient
The customer satisfaction coefficient
indicates whether satisfaction can be increased
by meeting requirement, or whether fulfilling
this product requirement merely prevents the
customer from being dissatisfaction [12]. Two
formula of calculating the extent of satisfaction
and dissatisfaction are stated below.

Step 3 Calculation of customer satisfaction
coefficient
Using Equations (1) and (2) to calculate
customer satisfaction coefficients, the results are
shown I Table 2.

For instance, according to the data listed in
Table 2, nursing care with a positive CS
coefficient of 0.36 can only slightly increase
satisfaction. In another hand, nursing care with a
negative CS coefficient of -0.81 leads to more
than proportional dissatisfaction. Thus the
results can facilitate the manager to distinguish
quality need more efforts and resource to
improve their service.
Step 4 Integration with QFD
Finally, the QFD for designing impressive
healthcare service is shown in Figure 2.
IV. CONCLUSION
This study provides an integration of Kano
model and a traditional survey to satisfying
customer requirements. Kano model is applied
to identify customer needs, and calculate
customer satisfaction coefficient that helps the
manager to trade-off which is the most
importance quality for increasing satisfaction.
Then, four phases of quality function
development are used to translate the voice of
the customer’s needs into the regular service 
planning. With this methodology, Managers can
identify and prioritize what customers need. The
steps described here are practical procedures for
improving and upgrading health care service
quality and in turn influencing customer
satisfaction. Furthermore, the integrated
approach applied in the research could be used
for hospitals which are trying to build their
strategies for improving service quality. In this
paper we have systematically shown how
Kano’s model of customer satisfaction can be 
integrated into quality function deployment.
Such methodology can help the manager
establish sustainable competitive.
