ABSTRACT 
This project report deals with the stochastic dynamic behaviors of nonlinear vibration of the fluid-conveying 
double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) by considering the effects of the geometric nonlinearity and the 
nonlinearity of van der Waals (vdW) force. In addition, the small scale effects of the nonlinear vibration of 
the DWCNTs are studied by using the theory of nonlocal elasticity. The nonlinear governing equations of the 
fluid-conveying DWCNTs are formulated based on the Hamilton’s principle. The Young’s modulus of 
elasticity of the DWCNTs is assumed as stochastic with respect to the position to actually describe the 
random material properties of the DWCNTs. By utilizing the perturbation technique, the nonlinear governing 
equations of the fluid-conveying can be decomposed into two sets of nonlinear differential equations 
involving the mean value of the displacement and the first variation of the displacement separately. Then we 
adopt the harmonic balance method in conjunction with Galerkin’s method to solve the nonlinear differential 
equations successively. Some statistical dynamic response of the DWCNTs such as the mean values and 
standard deviations of the amplitude of the displacement are computed, meanwhile the effects of the flow 
velocity and small scale coefficients on the statistical dynamic response of the DWCNTs are investigated. It 
is concluded that the mean value and standard deviation of the amplitude of the displacement increase 
nonlinearly with the increase of the frequencies and decrease as the flow velocity increases. Furthermore, 
small scale coefficients have significant influence on the mean value, standard deviation and coefficient of 
variation of the amplitude of the DWCNTs.

1. Introduction 
Since the landmark paper published by Iijima [1], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted worldwide 
attention due to their potential use in the fields of chemistry, physics, nano-engineering, electrical 
engineering, materials science, reinforced composite structures and construction engineering. Carbon 
nanotubes (CNTs) are used for a variety of technological and biomedical applications including 
nanocontainers for gas storage and nanopipes conveying fluids [2-8]. Some important applications of carbon 
nanotubes (CNTs) are such as nanotubes conveying fluids [3,7-8], different types of fluid flows like water [9], 
dynamic flow of methane, ethane and ethylene molecules [10] and the diffusive transport of light gases [11] 
had been reported, and the effects of these fluids on the mechanical properties of CNTs had been investigated. 
Generally there are two methods widely adopted to study the CNTs conveying fluids. One is the molecular

2. Nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam model for fluid-conveying DWCNTs  
 
 
 
Fig. 1.  Double-walled carbon nanotubes conveying fluid. 
 
In Fig. 1, the double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) is modeled as a double-tube pipe which is 
composed of the inner tube of radius 1R  and the outer tube of radius 2R . The thickness of each tube is h , 
the length is L , and Young’s modulus of elasticity is E . It is noted that the Young’s modulus of elasticity 
E  is assumed as stochastic with respect to the position to actually describe the random material property of 
the DWCNTs.  The internal fluid is assumed to flow steadily through the inner tube with a constant velocity 
U . Besides, the boundary conditions of the DWCNTs are assumed as simply-supported at both ends. 
Based on the theory of Euler–Bernoulli beam and a nonlinear strain–displacement relationship of Von 
Karman type, the displacement field and strain–displacement relation can be written as follows:

where x is the axial coordinate, t is time, iu  and iw  denote the total displacements of the ith tube along the 
x coordinate directions, ui and wi define the axial and transverse displacements of the ith tube on the neutral 
axis, i the corresponding total strain, and the subscript i = 1 and i = 2. Notice that tube 1 is the inner tube 
while tube 2 is the outer tube. 
The potential energy V stored in a DWCNTs and the virtual kinetic energy T in the DWCNTs as well as the 
fluid inside the DWCNTs are individually written as follows:

3. Small scale effect of nonlinear vibration of DWCNTs by nonlocal elasticity theory 
Based on Eringen nonlocal elasticity model [30], the stress at a reference point x in a body is considered 
as a function of strains of all the points in the near region. The above assumption is in agreement with the 
atomic theory of lattice dynamics and experimental observations on phonon dispersion.  
Consider a homogeneous and isotropic elastic solid, the constitutive equation is 
0( ) : (| |, ) ( ) ( )
V
dV    σ x C x x ε x x                                                   (13) 
where symbols ‘:’ is the inner product with double contraction, 0C  is the elastic stiffness matrix of classical 
isotropic elasticity, σ(x)  denotes the nonlocal stress tensor at x, and ε(x )  is the strain tensor at any point x′ 
in the body. The kernel function (| |, )  x x  is the nonlocal modulus, | | x x is the Euclidean distance, 
and 0 /e a l   , where 0e  is a constant appropriate to each material, a is an internal characteristic size (e.g. 
size of C–C bond, lattice spacing, granular distance) and l is an external characteristic size (crack size, wave 
length etc.). The volume integral in Eq. (13) is over the region V occupied by the body. The kernel function is 
given as [30] 
2 1
0(| |, ) (2 ) ( / )l K l    x x x                                                     (14) 
where 0K  is the modified Bessel function.  
By incorporating Eq. (13) and (14), the following equation can be derived  
     2 2 20 0(1 ) :e a  σ C ε                                                               (15) 
It is noted that the scale 0e a  in the Eq. (15) will lead to small scale effect on the response of structures in 
nano-size, furthermore, the classical (local) elasticity theory is recovered if the small scale coefficient 0e a  
is set to be zero. 
Based on Eqs. (11-12) and Eq. (15) and the formulations derived by Chang [22, 24], the coupled nonlinear 
governing equations for the free vibration of DWCNTs conveying fluid based on nonlocal elasticity theory 
are given as follows:

where 0 01 2( ), ( )w x w x  are the mean values of displacement of the inner and outer tubes separately. 
Substituting Eqs. (18-20) into Eqs. (16-17) yields

First of all, we examine the effect of the nonlinearity on the amplitude-frequency properties of the nonlinear 
vibration. The relations of the mean value of amplitude versus frequency are depicted in Fig. 2. It can be seen 
that the mean value of the amplitude increases with the increase of the frequencies. It is completely 
reasonable that the relation between the mean value of the amplitude and the frequency is nonlinear; in 
addition, the mean value of the amplitude of the outer tube is larger than that of the inner tube. Furthermore, 
it is noted that the mean value of the amplitude gets smaller as the small scale coefficient 0e a increases for 
the fixed frequency. In order to see the influence of the flow velocity on the amplitude, we change the flow 
velocity from 400 m/sec to 1600 m/sec and the results are presented in Fig. 3. As it is seen from the figure 
that the mean value of the amplitude of the inner tube decrease with the increase of the flow velocity, 
however, the mean value of the amplitude of the outer tube has only slight change due to the flow velocity 
increase, which is reasonable since the fluid only flows inside the inner tube. In Fig. 4, the standard deviation 
of the amplitude is plotted with respect to the frequency. As it can be found from the figure that the standard 
deviation of the amplitude increases nonlinearly with the increase of the frequencies, and it is noted that the 
standard deviation of the amplitude of the outer tube is larger than that of the inner tube. In Fig. 5, the flow 
velocity is changed from 400 m/sec to 1600 m/sec, the standard deviation of the amplitude is plotted with 
respect to the frequency. Similar results can be found as those in Fig. 4 except that the standard deviation of 
the amplitude of the inner tube is smaller. In Fig. 6, the coefficient of variation (COV) of the amplitude is 
depicted with respect to the frequency for the velocity U=400 m/sec. It is noticed that the coefficient of 
variation of the amplitude of the inner tube is around 0.10, however, the coefficient of variation of the 
amplitude of the outer tube is around 0.12. As we change the flow velocity from 400 m/sec to 1600 m/sec, 
the results are slightly different as it can be found from Fig. 7. In this case, the coefficient of variation of the 
amplitude of the inner tube ranges between 0.110 and 0.125. Finally, Fig. 8 presents the coefficient of 
variation of amplitude versus frequency with 0 / 0.1e a L   for different values of flow velocity. It is found 
that the coefficient of variation of amplitude fluctuates between 0.10 and 0.12 and no specific relation 
between COV and flow velocity can be established despite they are correlated. Therefore, based on the 
results from Figs. 2-8, it can be concluded that the flow velocity and small scale coefficient have significant 
influence on the mean value, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the amplitude of the 
DWCNTs.

7. Conclusions 
 
 In the present study, we investigate the stochastic dynamic behaviors of nonlinear vibration of the 
double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) conveying fluid by considering the effects of the geometric 
nonlinearity and the nonlinearity of van der Waals (vdW) force. In addition, the small scale effects of the 
nonlinear vibration of the DWCNTs are studied by using the theory of nonlocal elasticity. Based on the 
Hamilton’s principle, the nonlinear governing equations of the fluid-conveying double-walled carbon nanotubes 
are formulated. The Young’s modulus of elasticity of the DWCNTs is considered as stochastic with respect to 
the position to actually characterize the random material properties of the DWCNTs. By using the perturbation 
technique, the nonlinear governing equations of the fluid-conveying double-walled carbon nanotubes can be 
decomposed into two sets of nonlinear differential equations involving the mean value of the displacement and 
the first variation of the displacement separately. Then the harmonic balance method and Galerkin’s method are 
adopted to solve the nonlinear differential equations successively. Some statistical dynamic response of the 
DWCNTs such as the mean values and standard deviations of the amplitude of the displacement are calculated,

Abstract - Based on the theories of thermal elasticity 
mechanics and nonlocal elasticity, an elastic Bernoulli–Euler 
beam model is developed for thermal-mechanical vibration 
and buckling instability of a single-walled carbon nanotube 
(SWCNT) conveying fluid and resting on an elastic medium. 
The finite element method is adopted to obtain the numerical 
solutions to the model. The effects of temperature change, 
nonlocal parameter and elastic medium constant on the 
vibration frequency and buckling instability of SWCNT 
conveying fluid are investigated. It can be concluded that at 
low or room temperature, the fundamental natural frequency 
and critical flow velocity for the SWCNT increase as the 
temperature change increases. The fundamental natural 
frequency for the SWCNT decreases as the nonlocal 
parameter increases, both the fundamental natural frequency 
and critical flow velocity increase with the increase of the 
elastic medium constant.

1 Introduction 
  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) discovered by Iijima [1] 
have attracted worldwide attention. Recently, the analysis of 
CNTs has been of great interest to many researchers because 
of their exceptional mechanical, electronic, electrochemical, 
physical and thermal properties [2-6]. The classic elastic 
continuum models have been widely used to study the 
vibration behavior of CNTs. Many studies related to  the field 
are depicted in the references (Yoon et al. [3,7], Reddy et al. 
[8], Wang et al. [9] and Zhang et al. [10]). It is quite essential 
to perform the vibration and buckling analysis of carbon 
nanotubes by considering the thermal effects since the 
influence of temperature change on the instability of 
SWCNTs conveying fluid is significant. Among others, the 
following researchers have already contributed to the 
development of this field: Zhang et al. [11], Wang et al. [12], 
Ni et al. [13], Li and Kardomateas [14]. The nonlocal 
elasticity theory was first initiated by Eringen [15]. The 
importance of nonlocal elasticity theory stimulated the 
researchers to investigate the properties of the micro/nano 
structures more accurately and conveniently. Application of 
nonlocal continuum theory to nanotechnology was initially 
reported by Peddieson et al. [16]. Many studies related to 
nonlocal elasticity theory are depicted in the references 
(Zhang et al. [17], Sudak [18] [26], Lu et al. [19], Zhang et al. 
[20], Wang et al. [21] and Murmu and Pradhan [22]). 
In this paper, an elastic Bernoulli–Euler beam model is 
developed for the thermal-mechanical vibration and buckling 
instability of SWCNT conveying fluid based on the nonlocal 
elasticity theory. The effects of temperature change, nonlocal 
small scale and Winkler modulus parameter on the properties 
of vibration frequency and buckling instability are 
investigated.  
2 Thermal-nonlocal beam model 
for SWCNTs conveying fluid  
 In the present study, CNT is assumed to be fixed at both 
ends as shown in Fig. 1, and embedded into an elastic 
medium such as polymer. The length of the nanotube is 
denoted as L . Here we shall neglect the gravity effect as 
usual. Thus, let the mean flow velocity and the mass per unit 
length of the fluid be U  and M , respectively. The 
governing equation for thermal vibration and structural 
instability of a CNT conveying fluid based on nonlocal 
elasticity theory can be derived as

variation of fundamental frequency of SWCNT with flow 
velocity for different temperature changes in low or room 
temperature. As the flow velocity increases, the nanotube 
becomes more flexible and the natural frequencies get 
reduced. When the flow velocity exceeds a certain value, the 
fundamental natural frequency becomes zero and the 
nanotube becomes unstable, this corresponds to the inducing 
of instability of the SWCNT. The flow velocity producing the 
zero natural frequency is classified as the critical flow 
velocity of the system. It should be noted that the results 
presented in Fig. 2 show a similar tendency with those 
presented in Refs. [5] and [7]. As for the presence of 
temperature change in low or room temperature, the increase 
of the temperature change tends to increase the natural 
frequencies of the SWCNT as it can be detected from Fig. 2. 
Furthermore, it is noted that the critical flow velocity for the 
nanotube including the thermal effect is much larger than that 
without considering the change of temperature and increases 
with the increase of temperature change. Fig. 3 depicts the 
variation of fundamental frequency of SWCNT with flow 
velocity for different values of 0 /e a L  in low or room 
temperature. As it is found from Fig. 3 that the natural 
frequency is significantly influenced by the nonlocal 
parameter 0 /e a L , while the critical flow velocity is much 
less influenced by the nonlocal parameter 0 /e a L . The 
nonlocal parameter 0 / 0e a L   denotes the result obtained 
by classical Euler beam model. As the nonlocal parameter 
increases, the fundamental natural frequency decreases. Fig. 4 
presents the variation of fundamental frequency of SWCNT 
with flow velocity for different values of Winkler constant K  
in low or room temperature. It is found that both the natural 
frequency and critical flow velocity are significantly 
influenced by Winkler constant. As the elastic medium 
constant K increases, the fundamental frequency also 
increases, which is reasonable since increasing the elastic 
medium constant makes the SWCNT stronger. The critical 
flow velocity also increases with the increase of the elastic 
medium constant K. Based on the results in Figs. 2-4, the 
effects of temperature change, nonlocal parameter and elastic 
medium constant are very significant on the fundamental 
natural frequency and critical flow velocity of fluid-
conveying SWCNT embedded in an elastic medium.
