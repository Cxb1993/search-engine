 2 
necrosis factor (TNF) and block TGF-β1-
mediated protection of murine L929 
fibroblasts from TNF cytotoxicity (6-8).   
 
Hyaluronidases PH-20, Hyal-1 and 
Hyal-2 induce the expression of tumor 
suppressor WW domain-containing 
oxidoreductase, known as WWOX, FOR or 
WOX1 (8-11).  Human WWOX gene is 
located on a chromosomal fragile site 16q23 
and encodes WWOX/FOR/WOX1 and 
isoforms (9,10,12-16).  The full-length 46-
kDa WOX1 possesses two N-terminal WW 
domains (containing conserved tryptophan 
residues), a nuclear localization sequence 
between the WW domains, and a C-terminal 
short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase 
(SDR) domain.  Numerous exogenous 
stimuli, including sex steroid hormones, 
TNF, anisomycin, UV light and apoptosis 
inducers, induce WOX1 activation via 
phosphorylation at Tyr33 and nuclear 
translocation both in vivo and in vitro (9,17-
20).   
 
Human and mouse WWOX/WOX1 
appears to play a dual role in regulating cell 
survival and death (10; review).  Ectopic 
WOX1 exerts apoptosis in vitro (9,17-22) 
and inhibits tumor growth in vivo (12,22).  
Targeted deletion of murine Wwox gene to 
exons 2-4 induces spontaneous tumor 
formation in the lung and bone marrow (23).  
The whole body Wwox gene-ablated mice 
can only survive for approximately one 
month (23).  Later on, murine Wwox gene 
was shown to be essential for postnatal 
survival and normal bone metabolism in 
mice (24), and development of the 
reproductive system (25,26).  Indeed, 
several prior reports have clearly indicated 
that endogenous human and mouse 
WWOX/WOX1 is upregulated at both gene 
and protein levels during embryonic 
development (27) and in early stages of 
hyperplasia and cancerous progression of 
human breast and prostate (17,28-31).  Also, 
WWOX/WOX1 is upregulated during 
normal skin keratinocyte differentiation, as 
well as in the early stages of UVB-induced 
formation of squamous cell carcinoma in 
humans and mice (20).  Again, these 
observations support the dual functional 
roles of WWOX/WOX1 in supporting cell 
survival, differentiation and organogenesis 
and yet controlling cancer growth. 
 
WOX1 binds numerous proteins in the 
stress signaling and apoptotic responses and 
factors in gene transcription (10,32; 
reviews).  In this study, we investigated 
whether TGF-β1 signals via a pathway 
independently of TβRII and examined 
whether this signaling activates WOX1 for 
cell growth regulation.  Here, we 
demonstrated a novel signaling involving 
the binding of TGF-β1 with membrane 
Hyal-2 and then recruiting WOX1.  The 
resulting Hyal-2/WOX1 complexes relocate 
to the nuclei for controlling the activation of 
Smad-driven promoter, thereby regulating 
cell growth and death. 
 
Experimental Procedures 
 
Cell lines, chemicals, antibodies, and 
polyclonal antibody production - Murine 
L929 fibroblasts and human TβRII-deficient 
colorectal HCT116 cells, from the American 
Type Culture Collections, have been 
maintained in our laboratory (8,9) and used 
in this study.  Platelet-derived TGF-β1 was 
from R & D Systems, and recombinant 
TGF-β1 from PeproTek.  DAPI, 4',6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole, was from 
Calbiochem. 
 
We have generated polyclonal antibodies 
against 1) an N-terminal segment of WOX1 
at the first WW domain (pan-specific for 
human, rat and mouse) (17), 2) a WOX1 
peptide with Tyr33 phosphorylation at the 
first WW domain (pan-specific for human, 
rat and mouse) (17), and 3) the unique C-
terminus of human WWOX/WOX1 (15).  In 
addition, a synthetic peptide of murine Hyal-
2, NH2-CPDVEVARNDQLAWL-COOH (amino acid #227-241) was made (Genemed 
Synthesis).  We generated polyclonal 
antibodies against this peptide in rabbits 
using an EZ antibody production and 
purification kit (Pierce), as described 
(9,15,17).  The selected amino acid 
sequence of murine Hyal-2 is identical to 
that in human, pig, and rat.  Also, this region 
is predicted to be a helical, surface-exposed 
segment, according to homology searching 
in the Genbank database for the 3D structure 
 4 
 
Yeast two-hybrid analysis – Ras rescue-based 
CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid analysis 
(Stratagene) was performed to map the 
domain/domain interaction between Hyal-2 
and WOX1, as described (9,17,18).  Briefly, 
bait protein was tagged with Sos, and target 
protein tagged with a membrane-anchoring 
signal sequence (Stratagene).  Binding of the 
cytosolic Sos-tagged bait protein to the cell 
membrane-anchored target activates the 
Sos/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway, 
thereby allowing the growth of mutant yeast 
cdc25H at 37°C under a synthetic defined 
galactose media (-Ura, -Leu) in agarose 
plates.  That is, occurrence of positive 
protein/protein binding and subsequent 
activation of the Sos/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK 
signaling promotes yeast cells to grow at 
37°C, whereas at room temperature (22oC) all 
yeast cells grow in the selective medium 
(9,17,18).  Yeast cells were transfected with a 
bait construct (e.g. the full-length WOX1, the 
N-terminal first WW domain, or a Y33R 
mutant of the WW domain (in a pSos vector; 
Stratagene) and the Hyal-2 construct for 
membrane-anchoring (in a pMyr vector; 
Stratagene).  Colony growth and selection 
were then performed (9,17,18).  For positive 
controls, WOX1/p53 physical association and 
MafB self-interaction were carried out.  
Empty pSos/pMyr vectors were regarded as 
negative controls, which yielded no yeast 
colonies (9,17,18).   
 
Förster (Fluorescence) resonance energy 
transfer (FRET) - The full-length murine 
WOX1 and the catalytic domain of murine 
Hyal-2 were constructed in-frame with 
ECFP (enhanced cyan fluorescence protein) 
and EYFP expression vectors (Clontech), 
respectively.  L929 and HCT116 cells were 
transfected with both constructs by 
liposome-based Genefector (VennNova) and 
cultured 24-48 hr.  FRET analysis was 
performed using an inverted fluorescence 
microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE-2000U).  
Cells were stimulated with an excitation 
wavelength 440 nm.  FRET signals were 
detected at an emission wavelength 535 nm 
(see Fig. 6A for the cartoon).  ECFP and 
EYFP were used as donor and acceptor 
fluorescent molecules, respectively.  The 
FRET images were corrected for 
background fluorescence from an area free 
of cells and spectral bleed-through.  The 
spectrally corrected FRET concentration 
(FRETc) was calculated by Youvan’s 
equation (using a software program Image-
Pro 6.1, Media Cybernetics): FRETc=(fret-
bk[fret])-cf[don]*(don-bk[don])-
cf[acc]*(acc-bk[acc]), where fret = fret 
image, bk = background, cf = correction 
factor, don = donor image, and acc = 
acceptor image.  The equation normalizes 
the FRET signals to the expression levels of 
the fluorescent proteins.  
 
Promoter activation assay – An assay kit for 
the promoter function driven by Smad was 
from SABiosciences.  HCT116 and L929 
cells were transfected with a promoter 
construct using GFP as a reporter by 
electroporation (200 volt and 50 msec; using 
a BTX ECM830 electroporator from 
Genetronics) or using liposome-based 
FuGENE 6 (Roche) or Genefector 
(VennNova).  Also, expression constructs for 
WOX1, Hyal-2(GLYH), DN-WOX1, and/or 
Smad4 were included in the mixtures for 
electroporation.  The cells were cultured for 
24 hr.  Promoter activation was examined 
under fluorescence microscopy.  Both 
positive and negative controls from the assay 
kit were also tested in each experiment.   
 
Results 
 
TGF-β1 induces WOX1 nuclear relocation 
in a TβRII-independent manner – We 
examined whether TGF-β1 stimulates 
relocation of WOX1 to the nuclei in murine 
L929 fibroblasts.  These cells are responsive 
to TGF-β1-induced proliferation (6-8).  
Also, TGF-β1 protects L929 cells from the 
cytotoxic effect of tumor necrosis factor (6-
8).  L929 fibroblasts were cultured overnight 
in RPMI medium, supplemented with 10% 
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS).  
In time-course experiments, stimulation of 
murine L929 fibroblasts with purified 
human platelet TGF-β1 resulted in a rapid 
nuclear relocation of WOX1 and its Tyr33-
phosphorylated form (or activated WOX1; 
p-WOX1) in 10-20 min, as determined by 
Western blotting (Fig. 1A).  FBS was 
included in the assay.  Similar results were 
observed using recombinant human TGF-β1 
 6 
hyaluronidase (5).  The produced antibody 
recognized a predicted 53-kDa Hyal-2 
protein in L929 cells (Fig. 3A).  Cell surface 
expression of Hyal-2 was shown in a high 
percentage of L929 cell population 
transfected with EGFP or buffer only (Fig. 
3A).  When L929 cells were transfected with 
the Hyal-2 antisense construct (tagged with 
EGFP), expression of cell surface Hyal-2 
was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A).  
Binding of TGF-β1 to the surface of Hyal-2 
antisense-expressing cells was significantly 
reduced (<10% binding, Fig. 3B).  In EGFP 
transfected or non-transfected controls, 
binding of TGF-β1 to the surface of these 
cells was not affected (~85% binding; Fig. 
3B). 
 
When purified platelet TGF-β1 was pre-
mixed with the synthetic Hyal-2 peptide for 
30 min at 4oC, binding of TGF-β1 to L929 
cell surface was blocked (Fig. S3), 
suggesting that TGF-β1 binds Hyal-2 to this 
surface-exposed segment.  In appropriate 
control experiments, we tested several 
peptides with similar compositions.  None of 
these were found to block the binding of 
TGF-β1 onto cell surface (data not shown). 
 
To further examine the specific role of 
Hyal-2 in signaling, cell surface Hyal-2 was 
cross-linked with our produced antibodies, 
followed by determining relocation of 
WOX1 to the nuclei.  Stimulation of L929 
cells with diluted Hyal-2 antiserum resulted 
in accumulation of WOX1 (and p-WOX1) in 
the nuclei (Fig. 3C), whereas non-immune 
control serum had no effect (data not 
shown).  These observations suggest that our 
produced Hyal-2 antibody acts as a specific 
agonist in inducing WOX1 nuclear 
relocation or activation. 
 
TGF-β1 binds to membrane Hyal-2 on 
microvilli as determined by 
immunoelectron microscopy – Next, we 
examined the morphological aspect on how 
TGF-β1 interacts with Hyal-2 by 
immunoelectron microscopy. TβRII-
deficient HCT116 cells were used in these 
experiments, so that there is no binding of 
TGF-β1 to the cell surface TβRII.  Purified 
platelet TGF-β1 was shown to interact with 
Hyal-2 on cell surface microvilli.  There 
were approximately 1-5 TGF-β1/Hyal-2 
particles per microvillus as determined from 
10 sections (Fig. 4A and 4B and see Fig. S4 
in the Supplemental Materials).  Briefly, 
HCT116 cells were exposed to purified 
TGF-β1 at 4oC for 90 min.  TGF-β1 was 
then covalently cross-linked onto cell 
membrane by DSS.  In negative control 
cells, albumin was cross-linked onto cell 
membrane. Essentially, little or no non-
specific binding was observed in control 
cells (Fig. S4).  
 
Hyal-2 is involved in the catabolism of 
hyaluronan (5).  The Hyal-2/hyaluronan 
complex is internalized by endocytic 
vesicles and then fused with lysosomes.  
Hyaluronan is then degraded.  Similarly, 
stimulation of cells with TGF-β1 at 37oC 
resulted in complex formation of TGF-
β1/Hyal-2 on the cell membrane, followed 
by internalization via endocytic vesicles 
(endosomes) and fusion with lysosomes 
(Fig. 4B).  In agreement with other report 
(36), Hyal-2 alone is present in the lysosome 
(Fig. 4B; see box #c). 
 
TGF-β1 increases the complex formation 
of Hyal-2 and WOX1 - In unstimulated 
HCT116 cells, a portion of endogenous 
WOX1 is physically associated with 
membrane Hyal-2 on microvilli, as 
determined by immunoelectron microscopy 
(Fig. 5A).  WOX1 alone also is present in a 
close proximity to the cell membrane area 
(Fig. 5A; see star).  The WOX1/Hyal-2 
complexes were found in the cytosol (Fig. 
5A).  TGF-β1 increased the complex 
formation of WOX1/Hyal-2 and its nuclear 
translocation (Figs. 5B and S5).  In most 
cases, HCT116 cells have large nuclei and 
relatively thin cytoplasmic areas; however, 
the cytoplasmic areas are increased when the 
cells fully spread out on plastic surface (Fig. 
S2).  Accordingly, there were higher 
numbers of WOX1/Hyal-2 complexes in the 
nucleus than in the cytoplasm, as averaged 
from random measurements in 2.5 µm2 
areas (Fig. 5C).  Nuclear accumulation of 
these complexes, either on nuclear 
envelopes or in nuclei, was increased upon 
exposure to TGF-β1 with time (Fig. 5C).  
Again, in negative controls, these 
immunogold particles did not non-
 8 
We further verified the WOX1/Hyal-2 
complex formation by co-
immunoprecipitation.  Stimulation of L929 
cells with TGF-β1 increased the formation 
of WOX1/Hyal-2 complex, as precipitated 
using anti-WOX1 antibody (Fig. 8A).  
Similar results were observed with HCT116 
cells stimulated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 8B).  We 
have developed a dominant-negative WOX1 
(DN-WOX1) and shown its inhibition of 
stress-induced WOX1 phosphorylation at 
Tyr33 (17,18).  Ectopic expression of DN-
WOX1 reduced the WOX1/Hyal-2 complex 
formation (reduction by 32±4%, n=3; Fig. 
8C), suggesting that phosphorylation of 
WOX1 at Tyr33 is essential for interacting 
with Hyal-2.   
 
WOX1 and Hyal-2 synergistically enhance 
the promoter activation driven by Smad 
proteins for subsequent cell death – Next, 
we determined whether WOX1 and Hyal-2 
affect the transcriptional activation of 
promoter driven by Smad proteins.  HCT116 
cells were transfected with a Smad-driven 
promoter construct (using GFP as a reporter), 
in the presence or absence of the WOX1 
and/or Hyal-2(GLYH) constructs (Fig. 9).  
WOX1 or Hyal-2 alone limitedly increased 
the transcriptional activation of the Smad 
promoter (Fig. 9).  Together, both proteins 
dramatically enhanced the transcriptional 
activation of the Smad promoter in a 
synergistic manner (increase by 8-9 fold; Fig. 
9).  Ectopic Smad4 alone was not sufficient 
to induce the transcriptional activation, 
whereas in combination, both WOX1 and 
Smad4 significantly enhanced the promoter 
activation. Again, DN-WOX1 is a potent 
inhibitor of WOX1 phosphorylation at Tyr33 
(or activation), as well as a suppressor of 
p53-meidated cell death (17,18).  No 
promoter activation occurred when both DN-
WOX1 and Smad4 were co-transfected in the 
cells (Fig. 9).   
 
Notably, there were 98% and 95% death 
in the promoter-activated cells transfected 
with WOX1/Hyal-2 and WOX1/Smad4, 
respectively (determined by DAPI staining).  
Much less death was shown for cells 
transfected with WOX1, Hyal-2, Smad4, DN-
WOX1, or the promoter alone (approximately 
2-20% death).  No cell death was shown in 
both the positive and negative controls.  The 
experiment was also carried out in L929 cells, 
which showed similar results (data not 
shown). 
 
Discussion 
 
In this study, we have shown for the first 
time that cell surface hyaluronidase Hyal-2 
is a cognate receptor for TGF-β1.  TGF-β1 
binds Hyal-2 on the microvilli of the plasma 
membrane.  This binding allows 
internalization of TGF-β1/Hyal-2 complexes 
via endosomes, and then fusion of 
lysosomes with the internalized endosomes.  
Whether this event leads to degradation of 
TGF-β1 in the lysosomes is unknown.  
 
We determined the TGF-β1/Hyal-
2/WOX1 signaling by immunoelectron 
microscopy, time-lapse FRET analysis in 
live cells, yeast two-hybrid analysis, and co-
immunoprecipitation.  The sequential 
signaling event involves: 1) TGF-β1 binds 
plasma membrane Hyal-2 to a surface-
exposed segment in the catalytic domain, 2) 
the binding rapidly promotes the complex 
formation of WOX1 and Hyal-2, and 3) the 
WOX1/Hyal-2 complexes relocate to the 
nuclei for enhancing promoter activation 
driven by Smad proteins (Fig. 10A).   
 
Alternatively, the membrane TGF-
β1/Hyal-2 complexes are internalized via 
endocytic vesicles.  Hyal-2 is then released 
to the cytoplasm, followed by interacting 
with cytosolic WOX1 and the resulting 
Hyal-2/WOX1 complexes relocating to the 
nuclei (Fig. 10B).  
 
Finally, from the promoter activation 
assays, we determined that WOX1 and 
Smad4, when in combination, dramatically 
activated the promoter function, suggesting 
that WOX1 physically interacts with Smad4, 
and that Smad4 is associated with the Hyal-
2/p-WOX1 complexes.  That is, binding of 
TGF-β1 to the cell membrane Hyal-2 results 
in recruitment of p-WOX1 and Smad4.  
Then, the Hyal-2/p-WOX1/Smad4 
complexes relocate to the nuclei (Fig. 10C).  
The protein complexes bind the Smad 
promoter via Smad4, thus effectively 
leading to promoter activation.  Smad4 
 10 
and suppressive manners in different types 
of cells (51,52). 
 
WOX1 interacts with several 
transcription factors such as p53 (9,17,18), 
p73 (53), AP2γ (54), ErbB2 (55), and ErbB4 
(49,50).  Among these, p53 is known to 
participate in TGF-β signaling at various 
points in the pathway by interacting with 
Smad proteins (56,57).  Thus, p53 may 
participate in the transcriptional regulation 
by interacting with WOX1/Hyal-2/Smad4.  
Whether p53 enhances or blocks the 
function of WOX1/Hyal-2 complexes in 
supporting cell growth or enhancing death 
remains to be determined.  
 
Upon stimulation with TGF-β1, WOX1 
may translocate to the cell surface and bind 
Hyal-2 via its N-terminal WW domains, as 
evidenced by both immunofluorescence 
staining and immunoelectron microscopy.  
This binding depends upon Tyr33 
phosphorylation in the WW domains.  Tyr33 
phosphorylation of WOX1 probably occurs 
in the cytosol prior to translocation to the 
cell surface.  Src is known to phosphorylate 
WOX1 at Tyr33 (10,32).  Presence of 
WOX1/Hyal-2 complexes on the nuclear 
membrane or envelope is intriguing.  We 
have determined the presence of a 
mitochondria-targeting sequence in the C-
terminal SDR domain of WOX1 (9).  We 
propose that the membrane insertion of 
WOX1 is mediated through this 
mitochondria-targeting sequence.  
 
Finally, we have shown that sex steroid 
hormones (e.g. estrogen and androgen) 
upregulate and activate WWOX/WOX1, 
isoform WOX2, p53 and ERK in COS7 
fibroblasts, primary lung epithelial cells, and 
androgen receptor (AR)-negative prostate 
DU145 cells, but not in estrogen receptor 
(ER)-positive breast MCF7 cells (19).  
Prolonged activation of WOX1 may render 
apoptosis in COS7 cells.  Failure of sex 
steroid hormones in stimulating the 
activation of WOX1 and WOX2 in benign 
breast cancer cells (19), suggesting that 
Hyal-2 retains WOX1 and WOX2 on the 
cell membrane and blocks its tumor 
suppressor function.  Invasive breast cancer 
cells are frequently deficient in the wild type 
WOX1 (19,29).  Overexpressed WOX2 
effectively induces apoptosis as that of 
WOX1 (Chang el al., unpublished), whereas 
the physiological function of WOX2 is 
largely unknown.  Whether WOX2 and 
other isoforms act as dominant negatives in 
blocking the function of wild type 
WWOX/WOX1 is unknown.  Also, whether 
these proteins bind Hyal-2 and block the 
TGF-β1/Hyal-2 signaling, thereby 
enhancing cancer growth, remains to be 
established.

time 0.  p-WOX1, Tyr33-phosphorylated WOX1.  p-ERK, Tyr204-phosphorylated ERK.  B, 
Under similar conditions, HCT116 cells were treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) and shown to 
have relocation of the above-mentioned proteins to the nuclei (mean ± standard deviation, 
n=3).  cyto = cytosol; nucl = nucleus. 
 
Figure 2. TGF-β1-induced WOX1 relocation to the nuclei as determined by confocal 
microscopy.  A, L929 cells were transfected with EGFP or human WOX1/WWOX (EGFP-
hWOX1) using FuGENE 6, followed by culturing for 24 hr, and then stimulating with TGF-
β1 for 4 hr.  The prolonged treatment was to optimize protein migration, since the protein 
was tagged with EGFP.  By confocal microscopy, EGFP-hWOX1 and endogenous Smad4 
were shown to accumulate in the nuclei (>95% nuclear localization for both proteins; ~150 
cells from 3 experiments).  In EGFP-expressing cells, TGF-β1 caused nuclear accumulation 
of endogenous Smad4 (>97%), but not EGFP (~1%).  Control, non-transfected cells.  B, 
Similarly, HCT116 cells were transiently overexpressed with EGFP or EGFP-hWOX1, and 
exposure of these cells to TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 4 hr resulted in accumulation of EGFP-
hWOX1, but not EGFP, in the nuclei (mean ± standard deviation; ~150 cells counted from 3 
experiments).  Student’s t tests, controls versus cells treated with TGF-β1.  Scale bar = 20 
µm (for A and B).  Magnification: 600x.  Controls, non-transfected cells (also see Figs. S1 
and S2 in the Supplemental Materials). 
 
Figure 3. TGF-β1 binds to cell surface Hyal-2.  A, Antibody was produced against a synthetic 
Hyal-2 peptide and shown to interact with a 53-kDa Hyal-2 in L929 cells, as determined by 
Western blotting.  L929 cells were electroporated with an EGFP-tagged Hyal-2-antisense 
construct, EGFP-Hyal-2(as) (see Experimental Procedures), and cultured for 48 hr.  The 
Hyal-2 antisense-expressing cells exhibited green fluorescence and had a significantly 
reduced expression of cell surface Hyal-2 (red fluorescence for Hyal-2 using antibody stain; 
5.7±2.2% positive in total cells, n=3), compared to EGFP-expressing cells (92±7.2% 
positive, n=3) and non-transfected cells (93±4.8% positive, n=3).  B, TGF-β1 did not bind to 
the surface of Hyal-2 antisense-expressing L929 cells, as compared to EGFP-expressing cells 
or non-transfected cells (>85% binding).  That is, the percentage of positive-binding cells 
showed the TGF-β1 signal (red) above the background control cells.  C, Stimulation of L929 
cells with anti-Hyal-2 antiserum (1/500 final dilution) for 1 hr induced significant 
accumulation of WOX1 and p-WOX1 in the nuclei, compared to the levels at time 0 (mean ± 
standard deviation, n=3; p=0.013 for WOX1 and p=0.0025 for p-WOX1; Student’s t tests; 
see the bar graph).  The background WOX1 phosphorylation was due to fetal bovine serum 
in the cell culture.  Non-immune serum had no apparent effect in inducing WOX1 nuclear 
relocation (data not shown).   
 
Figure 4. TGF-β1 binds to cell surface Hyal-2 on microvilli followed by internalization via 
endosomes.  A, TβRII-negative HCT116 cells were exposed to 250 ng/ml TGF-β1 (in PBS 
containing 10 µg/ml bovine serum albumin) on ice for 90 min, followed by processing DSS 
cross-linking and immunoelectron microscopy.  Exogenous TGF-β1 bound membrane Hyal-
2 mainly on microvilli (colocalization of large and small immunogold particles; 
magnification 6,000x).  There were approximately 1-5 TGF-β1/Hyal-2 particles per 
microvillus as determined from 10 sections.  Hyal-2, labeled with specific anti-Hyal-2 
antibody and 20 nm anti-rabbit immunogold particles (see large particles); TGF-β1, labeled 
 16 
bypassing the Sos/Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling.  The N-terminal first WW domain of Wox1 
(1stWW) bound Hyal-2.  Alteration of Tyr33 to Arg33 in the first WW domain (Y33R) 
abolished its interaction with Hyal-2.  
 
Figure 8. TGF-β1 increases the complex formation of Hyal-2 and WOX1, as determined by 
co-immunoprecipitation.  A, L929 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 30 min, 
which resulted in increased formation of WOX1/Hyal-2 complex, as determined by co-
immunoprecipitation with antibody against WOX1.  Pre-IP: one-twentieth amounts of 
protein samples for immunoprecipitation were loaded onto SDS-PAGE (~30 µg).  B, 
Similarly, HCT116 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) for 30 min, followed by 
immunoprecipitation with anti-p-WOX1 IgG.  TGF-β1 increased the binding of Hyal-2 with 
WOX1.  C, HCT116 cells were transiently overexpressed with a dominant-negative WOX1 
(DN-WOX1; tagged with EGFP) or EGFP alone.  DN-WOX1 inhibited the WOX1/Hyal-2 
complex formation (reduction by 32±4%, n=3). 
 
Figure 9. WOX1 and Hyal-2 dramatically enhance promoter activation driven by Smad 
proteins for subsequent cell death.  HCT116 cells were transfected with a Smad-driven 
promoter (SP) construct (using GFP as reporter), in the presence or absence of WOX1, Hyal-
2(GLYH), Smad4, and/or DN-WOX1 constructs.  Both negative and positive control vectors 
were also used.  After culturing for 24 hr, the extent of promoter activation was measured as 
the number of cells with green fluorescence (10 fields counted per each cell preparation on a 
cover slide; 3 experiments; mean ± standard deviation).  The extent of cell death was 98% 
and 95% in promoter-activated cells transfected with WOX1/Hyal-2 and WOX1/Smad4, 
respectively (measured from DAPI staining).  Compared to positive control cells, these 
condensed, apoptotic cells exhibited smaller green fluorescent dots.  Approximately 2-20% 
death was observed in cells transfected with WOX1, Hyal-2, Smad4, DN-WOX1, or the 
promoter alone.  No cell death was shown in both the positive and negative control cells.   
 
Figure 10. TGF-β1/Hyal-2/WOX1 signaling.  Three likely signaling paths are: A, TGF-β1 
binds membrane Hyal-2 that subsequently recruits cytosolic Tyr33-phosphorylated WOX1 
(p-WOX1) to the membrane.  The resulting Hyal-2/p-WOX1 complexes translocate to the 
nuclei for enhancing the promoter function driven by endogenous Smad proteins.  Overly 
activated Smad promoter induces cell death.  B, Alternatively, the TGF-β1/Hyal-2 complexes 
are internalized via endocytic vesicles, followed by releasing of Hyal-2 to the cytoplasm for 
interacting with the cytosolic p-WOX1, and the p-WOX1/Hyal-2 complexes relocating to the 
nuclei.  C, An additional scenario is that Smad4 is recruited to the p-WOX1/Hyal-2 
complexes, followed by relocating to the nuclei.  This event is supported by our finding that 
when in combination, both WOX1 and Smad4 dramatically increased the Smad promoter 
activation.
