claimed that the noncellular, protein core stabilized the
aerobic granule structure.
The above discussion demonstrates that the distribution
of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in glucose or
acetate-fed aerobic granules remains unclear. The main
reason for this noted discrepancy is the absence of a
suitable staining scheme for probing simultaneously all of
the constituents of interest on a single granule. Table 1
presents the related studies that utilize stains to probe
nucleic acids and/or other EPS in “bio-aggregates.” Though
stained biofilm systems have been intensively investigated,
the investigations of stained granules are comparably rare.
Additionally, existing studies have applied up to three
stains to the same bio-aggregates for observation. Structural
differences can be substantial among individual granules
collected from the same wastewater sample. A staining
scheme for the same bio-aggregate with more than three
stains is highly desirable to acquiring detailed information
on how EPS is distributed in the same bio-aggregate and
minimize possible bias.
The extracellular matrix provides an architectural struc-
ture and mechanical stability for aerobic granules. Under-
standing the detailed structure of the matrix is the step
toward comprehensive modeling of complex transport/
reaction processes in the granules. The current work has
three principal goals. First, a novel quadruple staining
scheme is presented to evaluate the distributions of cells
(nucleic acids) and EPS (proteins, α- and β-D-glucopy-
ranose polysaccharides) in granules. Second, this scheme is
applied to an acetate-fed granule to demonstrate how
different conclusions regarding EPS distributions over
granule interiors can be acquired when the granules are
stained differently. The EPS in phenol-fed granules are
stained using the proposed quadruple staining approach to
identify the different distribution patterns of EPS when the
granules are stressed by phenol. Third, this study demon-
strates the use of an image processing scheme to build the
three-dimensional polygonal surface models for cells and
EPS in the granule. This structural information can be

not only the protein, but also the polysaccharide (in β-D-
glucopyranose form, nonetheless) was present in the core.
Additionally, the finding that β-D-glucopyranose polysac-
charide was not concentrated only in the outer layer but was
spread throughout the granule interior, is inconsistent with
the note of Wang et al. (2005), who reported that after
20 days of starvation, only a hollow shell with an intact
wall of β-J-glucopyranose polysaccharide remained in the
suspension.
Stained image of phenol-fed granule
Figure 2a–e present the appearance of the outer surface and
the fluorescent staining results probed at 360 μm from the
outer surface of a phenol-fed granule, respectively. As
Fig. 2a shows that the phenol-fed granule has a filamentous
layer on its surface, below which, a dense layer surrounds a
core (Fig. 2a). Staining results showed that the core and
dense layer consisted of protein (Fig. 2b), whereas, the α-D-
glucopyranose polysaccharides, cells, and β-D-glucopyra-
nose polysaccharides comprised the filamentous layer
(Fig. 2c–e). Specifically, the β-D-glucopyranose polysac-
charides were concentrated in the bottom layer, whereas,
the α-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides and cells were
distributed at the outer surface of the filamentous layer.
The EPS distributions in phenol-fed granules differed from
those in acetate-fed granules (Fig. 1).
Discussions
Interior structure of acetate-fed granulea
Based on the staining data presented in Fig. 1, Fig. 3a
shows the granule interior based on the staining scheme by
McSwain et al. (cells, α-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides,
and proteins). An outer layer with concentrated cells and
α-D-glucopyranose polysaccharide clearly surrounded a
noncellular protein core, just as that described by McSwain
et al. (2005).
Figure 3b shows a magnified view of the outer layer of
the granule (Fig. 1) on a scale similar to that reported by
Wang et al. (2005). Evidently, scanning one section of the
surface layer of a calcofluor white-stained granule supports

quadruple staining image combining Figs. 2b–e. The
acetate-fed granule interior can be approximated by a two-
layer structure, with the outer layer constituted by all four
analyzed components (proteins, α- and β-D-glucopyranose
polysaccharides, and cells) and a core primarily of protein
and β-D-glucopyranose polysaccharides (Fig. 1f). Cells
were crowded in an outer layer of thickness of roughly
250 μm. Therefore, the model of acetate-fed granule should
have at least a biologically active outer layer covering a
heterogeneous polysaccharide-protein core (with holes).
A series of CLSM images were utilized to reconstruct
the interior structure of granules using the following image
processing scheme (Chu and Lee 2004). Otsu’s scheme was
applied to determine the threshold values for each CLSM
image; then, the threshold value was applied to bilevel each
image. A series of bileveled images were then obtained.
Next, the three-dimensional visualization and modeling
software, Amira 3.0 (TGS, USA), was employed to

Membrane biofouling by extracellular polymeric substances
or soluble microbial products from membrane
bioreactor sludge

Abstract This study extracted the soluble microbial prod-
ucts and loosely bound and tightly bound extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS) from suspended sludge from a
membrane bioreactor, original and aerobically/anaerobical-
ly digested, and compared their fouling potentials on a
microfiltration membrane. The resistance of cake layer
accounts for 95–98% of the total filtration resistances when
filtering the whole sludges, with anaerobically digested
sludge presenting the highest resistance among the three
tested sludges. The tightly bound EPS has the highest
potential to foul the membrane; however, the loosely bound
EPS contribute most of the filtration resistances of the
whole sludges. The foulants corresponding to the irrevers-
ible fouling have chemical fingerprints similar to those
from loosely bound EPS, which have a greater predilection
to proteins and humic substances than to polysaccharides.
Keywords EPS . SMP. Biofouling .MBR
Introduction
Sludge liquor consists of living cells and microbial
products, including extracellular polymeric substances
(EPS), inert biomasses, and soluble microbial products
(SMP) (Laspidou and Rittmann 2002). The SMP are
soluble cellular components that are either secreted by cells
during synthesis of biomass or are excreted for uncertain
reasons. The EPS have been differentiated into an extract-
able EPS that is bound tightly with solid surfaces and a
soluble EPS, also called slime polymers, that is able to
move freely between sludge flocs and surrounding liquor
(Rosenberger and Kraume 2002). Other classification
paradigms have separated EPS into “loosely bound” and
“tightly bound” fractions (Poxon and Darby 1997). Laspidou
and Rittmann (2002) observed that soluble EPS=loosely
bound EPS (LBEPS)=SMP (mixed liquor). Li et al. (2004)
noted that only soluble EPS, and not the total EPS,
correlated with performance of flocculation and sedimenta-
tion processes of sludges.
Membrane biofouling via microbial products plays a
critical role in determining the feasibility of utilizing a
membrane bioreactor (MBR) in the field (Ramesh et al.
2006a). Individual microbial products can have distinct
fouling potentials on a membrane, leading to different
control strategies for preventing or reducing their chance to
be in contact with the membrane. There exist no standard
extraction methods to differentiate various fractions of EPS
from the biomass; hence, the categories such as LBEPS or
tightly bound EPS (TBEPS) are an operationally defined
scheme depending on the measurement method used.
Ramesh et al. (2006b) extracted the SMP and LBEPS from
wastewater sludge, before and after aerobic or anaerobic
treatments, using a scheme proposed by Leung (2003) and
Li et al. (2004), and compared their physicochemical
characteristics thus obtained.
No studies in the literature, however, compared the
biofouling potentials of membranes by the SMP, LBEPS,
and TBEPS extracted from the same wastewater sludge.

Fig. 1 FTIR spectra for extract-

fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA,
USA). Excitation wavelengths were increased incremental-
ly from 200 to 400 nm at 10-nm intervals, whereas
emission wavelengths were detected at 1-nm steps.
Results
Extracted products from sludge
The extracted amounts for the SMP, LBEPS, and TBEPS
from sludge samples were listed in Table 1. The amounts of
extracted products from all sludge samples followed:
TBEPS>SMP>LBEPS. Furthermore, the weight of TBEPS
was only 3–5% of the total sludge. Moreover, aerobic and
anaerobic digestion reduced the EPS amounts.
Figure 1a–c presents the FTIR spectra of extracted SMP
and EPS from aerobically digested sludge. The spectra for
the original sludge and the anaerobically digested sludges
resemble those in Fig. 1 (but in different intensities) and,
for brevity, were not shown here. From the bands near
3,430, 2,929, and 1,090 cm−1, all SMP and EPS samples
contained polysaccharides, with the latter containing the
most polysaccharide. Based on bands near 1,380 cm−1,
both SMP and EPS contained a medium amount of lipids.
The characteristic bands for protein, including those near
1,650 and 1,450 cm−1, were present in EPS but were absent
in SMP samples. Conversely, the TBEPS lacked peaks at
1,656 (amide 1, C=O) and 1,542 (amide II, C–N+N–H)
cm−1, indicating an absence of proteins. The band for SMP
near 3,413 cm−1 for aerobically digested sludge separates
into two distinct bands near 3,325 and 3,250 cm−1,
corresponding to the presence of a primary amine.
However, there exists no clear evidence for the degradation
for EPS after digestion.
Figure 2a–c present the EEM spectra of suspensions
containing extracted SMP and EPS from aerobically
digested sludge. The spectra for the original sludge and
the anaerobically digested sludges also resemble those in
Fig. 2 (but in different intensities) and, for brevity, were not
shown here. Three peaks were noticeable in all EEM
spectra, namely, Ex/Em=275/340 nm (peak 1), 330/340 nm
(peak 2), and 390/420 nm (peak 3). According to a
classification scheme by Chen et al. (2003), peaks 1 and 2
are located in their region IV (soluble microbial by-product-
like), and peak 3 in region V (humic substance-like). All
EEM peak intensities were normalized using the Rayleigh
scattering intensity at their corresponding excitation wave-
lengths. The relative intensities of EEM peaks for all

irreversible foulants had been extracted in the heat
extraction stage.
Discussion
Figure 4a–c shows the FTIR spectra of irreversible foulants
extracted from membranes fouled by SMP, LBEPS, and
TBEPS of aerobically digested sludge. The spectra for the
original sludge and the anaerobically digested sludges were
similar to those shown in Fig. 4 and, for brevity, were not
shown here.
The characteristic bands for the irreversible foulants
were similar to those found for the precipitates separated
from the suspensions before filtration. Based on bands at
around 1,100 cm−1, the proteins/polysaccharide ratios for
irreversible foulants in SMP, LBEPS, and TBEPS tests
were less, greater, and equal to those from their
corresponding suspensions before filtration, respectively.
Figure 5a–c present the EEM spectra of suspensions
containing extracted substances from membranes fouled by
SMP, LBEPS, and TBEPS, of aerobically digested sludge,
respectively. The spectra for the original sludge and the
anaerobically digested sludges also resemble those in
Fig. 5. The three peaks for SMP and EPS samples were
also noticeable in all EEM spectra (it is not clear from the
figures, but the scanned data indicated the existence of the
peak, although at rather weak intensities). The normalized
EEM peak intensities follow: peak 1>2>3 (more soluble
microbial by-products than humic substances), while those
for LBEPS are much weaker than the other two samples.
Peak 3 for LBEPS for aerobically digested sludge sample
was comparable to those for the microbial by-products
(peaks 1 and 2). On the other hand, most irreversible
foulants in TBEPS were microbial product-like,
corresponding to the high filtration resistance noted in
Fig. 3.
Figure 6 shows the EEM spectra for the irreversible
foulants from the aerobically digested sludge. Clearly, the
EEM patterns in Fig. 6 resemble those for LBEPS (Fig. 5b).
Similar conclusions were drawn from the tests from original
and anaerobically digested sludge samples. Restated, the
irreversible foulants for all sludge samples examined were
probably attributable to the LBEPS fraction, and conse-
quently, it is this fraction that has the main contribution to
the irreversible fouling.
As mentioned above, the main foulants responsible for
irreversible fouling of the membrane were all from the
LBEPS fraction in the sludges. The irreversible fouling,
which is of great concern to long-term operations of MBR,
has a greater predilection to proteins and humic substances
than to polysaccharides.

A、通入氣泡以提昇掃流微過濾之效能  
摘要： 
本研究探討於掃流微過濾裝置中通入氣體對過濾效能之提升，並探討操作條件對多相流
掃流微過濾之濾速與濾餅性質之影響。在多相流之微過濾實驗中，改變通入之氣體流量，量
測其對於濾速，濾餅量與過濾阻力之變化。實驗結果顯示，當通氣量越大時，穩定濾速會越
高，但提昇之效率仍然有其最終極限。也都發現平均過濾比阻值並無顯著的變化，故濾餅成
長量為影響濾速的最主要因素，而濾餅成長量可以由本研究提出之模式估計。在本研究之操
作條件範圍內，氣體速度為 0.12 m/s 之濾速為無通氣時的 2 倍。故通入氣泡可以有效提升掃
流微過濾之效能。  
 
前言： 
在微過濾程序中，不論是採用濾餅過濾或掃流過濾的方式，都會有濾餅或結垢形成之情
況，而這也是過濾阻力來源之一。過去本研究團隊曾經探討過掃流過濾中各種因素之阻力的
影響，並發現其中大多以濾餅阻力為主要之影響。為了減緩濾餅以及結垢之形成，目前有幾
種常被使用之方式：適當的前處理、選擇適當的濾材、合宜的流場設計及引進電場或超音波。
為了提昇過濾技術之效率，本研究擬基於本實驗室過去對次微米粒子之過濾分離的微觀分析
專長與研究成果，針對在進料液通入氣體，觀察通入之氣泡，其性質對於掃流微過濾效率之
影響，進行解析，探討其最佳操作條件，以期得到最佳分離效率。本研究之研究目標有：將
實驗結果進行定量分析，試圖尋找可以使用之準則及應用範圍，以及了解分離對象與氣體之
間的作用機制對分離效率之影響，以便能隨之調整至最適操作條件。

 實驗前，將配置好的懸浮溶液，使用磁石攪拌器作固定轉速攪拌，以達到均勻分散懸浮

結果與討論： 
Fig. 2 為不同氣體量，對掃流微過濾之影響變化圖。由此圖可發現，若通入氣體，將使濾

過濾時若通入氣體，所得的穩定濾速，比未通氣時來的高，通氣量越大，穩定濾速相對的也
越高。其原因與通入的氣體有關，由於通入氣體，製造了紊流，改變過濾程序中流場之形態，
為一較不穩定且複雜之流動。又因氣體、液體與固體彼此皆有各自的體積，過濾中有氣體的

結論： 
過去本實驗室曾經探討過溫度、pH 值、離子濃度對於分離效應的影響，現今於掃流過濾
程序中通入氣泡，期望能提昇過濾效能。由實驗結果可得知，氣泡大小不太會隨著氣體量而
改變，平均過濾比阻也是如此，故主要影響濾餅阻力的因素為濾餅量。而通入氣體的確能有
效提昇過濾效能，經過濾餅性質與阻力的分析，發現通入氣體可有效減少濾餅的形成，使得
過濾時主要阻力來源-濾餅阻力得以減少，因而提高濾液量。當氣體量提昇為 0.12 m/s 時，其
過濾效能為未通氣時的 2 倍。注入氣體能提昇過濾效能，但是終究有其極限。

三、實驗裝置與方法 
 
 30
此外，本研究亦探討了平板式掃流微過濾之薄膜結垢機制。本部分之實驗所使用之裝置
採用之過濾系統如 Fig. 4 所示。其為一兩平行板式掃流微過濾系統，過濾模組以上下兩塊壓
克力板所組構而成。流體於模組中流動渠道之長度、寬度與高度分別為 5.5×10-2 m、2.0×10-2 m
及 1.0×10-3 m，實際過濾面積為 1.1×10-3 m2。過濾時以恆溫水槽來控制溫度，並固定攪拌速度
使懸浮液保持均勻的分散。在進行掃流過濾實驗時，懸浮液會經由蠕動幫泵輸送至過濾模組
中，透過浮子流量計 A 和 B 分別控制實驗所需的掃流速度與氣體流量，而過濾壓差則由針閥
來調整。實驗所得的濃縮液會再回流至攪拌槽中；濾液則會被收集至濾液收集瓶中，藉由數
位式天秤與電腦的連線進行實驗數據的截取與紀錄。為維持攪拌槽中的懸浮液濃度，過濾期
間會補充乾淨的等量濾液至懸浮液槽中。 
 
四、結果與討論 
先就沉浸式薄膜過濾的方面來討論粒子附著的情形。Fig. 5 為在不同的氣泡大小下，膜面
上所收集到的濾餅量。由圖可得知，當氣泡尺寸縮小時，縱使是在同一個通氣量下，小顆氣
泡的數目會比大顆氣泡的來得多，此情形對膜面的剪應力會有正面的影響，即氣泡體積縮小，
所造成的膜面剪應力相較之下就會變大，且通氣量越大的時候此現象就越為明顯。如 Fig. 6
上方的圖所示，氣泡尺寸較小，的確能使大的懸浮粒子不易附著於膜面上，若是再配合大通
氣量的話，效果則會更好，如此可印證之前所說，尺寸較小的氣泡，在同一通氣量之下，其
氣泡數多於大尺寸的氣泡，使得氣泡的掃除效果提升，進而讓粒子不易附著於膜面上，且大
粒子的效應較小粒子來得明顯。

接著再來看掃流微過濾的部份，從粒徑分佈來觀察，可以由 Fig. 7 發現在平均粒徑的部
份(5~6 μm)有很大的變化，在不通氣與最大通氣量(Ug=0.49 m/s)更有 6 倍左右的差距，這是
 32
退的最主要因素。Fig. 8 為不同氣體速度下的阻力分析，從圖中可以發現，濾餅阻力為全體阻
力值之冠，而乾淨薄膜阻力和薄膜內部阻力相對都很低，尤其是內部阻力方面幾近於零，這
是因為所選用的粒子粒徑大於薄膜孔洞的因素。以通氣與否進行比較發現，一旦過濾過程加
入通氣，可以有效降低各項阻力，代表實驗進行於曝氣環境底下是有抑制結垢產生之效果。
隨著通氣量的提昇，剪切力也隨之增加，造成大粒子被掃除，小粒子進入空隙後是造成阻力
提昇之原因，因此濾餅阻力會隨著氣體速度增加而增加。

對於蛋白質溶液之濾速行為與結垢現象，文獻中多對於高分子薄膜進行探討，而在無機薄膜

壓差、濃度、pH值、掃流速度)對濾速之影響，找出適當之清洗方法，並定量薄膜結垢之阻力
與建立濾速之分析模式。 
 
實驗裝置與方法： 
圖1為本實驗管式陶瓷薄膜過濾系統。進料溶液經由往復式幫浦送入模組中，進料速度(流
量)與操作壓力由回流與壓力閥來控制，而流量由校正過之液體流量計觀察。實驗之濃縮液皆
回流至進料槽中，濾液則以數位式電子秤秤取重量以計算濾速，並在紀錄濾液重後將其倒回
進料槽中以維持溶液濃度固定。使用之薄膜為TAMI公司生產之單通道管式陶瓷(TiO2, pI=4.22)
薄膜。測試之溶質有牛血清蛋白(BSA；MW=69k, pI=4.9)及環狀糊精(β-cyclo-dextrin；
MW=1,135)配製溶液之溶劑為去離子蒸餾水。在濾液定量分析，兩者皆以紫外/可見光譜儀分

操作條件 
1.薄膜：管式陶瓷膜MWCO 1k Da及5k Da。 
2.透膜壓差：200 ~ 800 kPa。 
3.進料流速：1.39 m/s。

單溶質溶液之影響 
圖4為BSA溶液在MWCO 1k與5k且掃流速度為1.39 m/s下，不同濃度與不同壓力下之濾速變
化，如圖所示當我們改變操作濃度範圍在2000到5000 ppm之間，不論是1k或5k在任一濃度下
濾速皆隨壓力增加而提高，但相同壓力不同濃度的比較下所得到之濾速差異卻很小，這樣的
結果是由於在該掃流速度下計算所得之流體流態為亂流(turbulent flow)形式，對膜面之擾
動足以將因濃度變化所形成之濃度極化層移除而使濾速不會因濃度增加而減少。另外，由於
兩膜之孔洞與溶質大小差異均很大，所以皆具有完全阻隔的效果。 
圖5則為BSA 3000 ppm溶液在不同pH值下所得到之濾速(pH=6.87為BSA溶於水中之值)，pH
值改變的實驗主要探討當膜面與蛋白質帶電對濾速的影響。由結果發現在pH=4.9時濾速為最
低，這是因為該pH值為BSA之等電點(pI)，此時BSA不帶電因此容易互相聚集成更大的分子；
也因為少了與膜面相互的排斥力，因此更易於吸附於膜面上使濃度極化與結垢更嚴重造成濾
速降低。而在另外三種pH值(3、6.87、10)下，低於BSA等電點之pH=3時，膜與BSA同為帶正電，
而高於BSA等電點的pH=6.87與10則為同帶負電的情況，雖然三種pH值情況下所帶電荷的強弱
造成的排斥力不徑相同，但由於亂流對膜面的擾動效果很強，因此使濾速不會因膜與溶質帶
電的強弱有明顯的改善。 
 40
下所得到之濾速最低，這是由於環狀糊精之分子量比孔洞大小略小，因此易於進入孔洞造成
孔洞阻塞的阻力，但加入高濃度蛋白質後，其會在膜面上形成結垢層阻擋部份環狀糊精透膜，
使孔洞阻塞轉變為膜面結垢因而輕微提升濾速。

二、 研究方法 
    圖1為管式無機陶瓷薄膜過濾系統。進料溶液經由膜片式幫浦送入模組管側，進料速度(流
量)與操作壓力由回流閥與壓力閥來控制，而流量可由校正過之液體流量計觀察。逆洗液則是
經由蠕動式幫浦送入模組之殼側，過濾及逆洗之切換是以電磁計時器控制電磁閥開關來控
制。實驗之濃縮液皆回流至進料槽中，濾液則以數位式電子天秤秤取重量以計算濾速，並在
紀錄濾液重後將其倒回進料槽中以維持溶液濃度固定。使用之薄膜為TAMI公司生產之單通道
管式陶瓷(TiO2)薄膜，測試溶質為牛血清蛋白(BSA；MW = 69,000)，配製溶液之溶劑為去離
子蒸餾水。 
 
操作條件 
1.薄膜種類：單通道管式陶瓷膜(MWCO 5,000) 
2.透膜壓差：100~400 kPa 
3.液體流速：0.1、0.3、0.5、0.7、1.0 m/s  
4.氣體流速：0.05、0.1、0.2 m/s 
5.進料溶質(BSA)濃度：1、2 kg/m3 
6.pH值：3、4.9(BSA之pI值)、7 
7.逆洗頻率：過濾15分鐘逆洗1分鐘、過濾10分鐘逆洗1分鐘、過濾5分鐘逆洗1分鐘 
 
三、討論與結論 
通氣之影響 
    圖2為BSA濃度1000ppm、壓力100 kPa下不同氣體速度之濾速變化圖，在此所用之氣體流
態皆為泰勒汽泡，由圖中可知在氣體速度UG=0.1 m/s時，其流體總速度為0.4 m/s，此時濾速僅
僅較液體流速UL=0.3 m/s時稍微高一點，通氣的效果較不明顯，推測會有這種情況是因為此時
 46
不同操作方式之影響與浄濾速分析 
   由於逆洗操作與ㄧ般過濾相比，必須考慮清洗消耗溶劑量，以及清洗所耗費的時
間，因此逆洗與ㄧ般過濾、通氣過濾、通氣加逆洗之性能，可以淨濾速來分析，淨濾
速之公式如下所示  
BF

QQJ +
−=  
其中 QF 為過濾所得之總濾液量，QB 為逆洗使用之溶劑量，tF、tB 則分別為過濾時間以
及逆洗所用之時間。  
    圖 6、7、8 為 pH3.0、4.9、7.0 時，不同操作方式之濾速變化圖不同，由圖中可發現各操
作方式在 pH 值為 3 時濾速最高、pH 值為 7 時次之、pH 值為 4.9 時濾速最低，這是因為濃度
極化層的阻力與 BSA 之電性及形狀有關，pH 值為 3 時 BSA 為帶狀且表面帶電，濃度極化層
不易堆積，因此濾速最高，pH 值為 4.9 時，BSA 為球狀且表面不帶電，因此所形成之濃度極
化層最緻密，使得濾速最低。 
    圖 9 為不同操作方式之下各 pH 值淨濾速對比圖，由圖中可知不論是逆洗或是逆洗加通
氣其淨濾速皆不如一般過濾，這是因為逆洗操作時，必須將逆洗所用之溶劑也列入考量，因
此其淨濾速皆不如一般過濾，由以上討論可知逆洗操作對濾速之提升有ㄧ定的功效，只是其
功效不足以彌補用來清洗之溶劑量，而通氣操作用於在此的系統時，為一極為有效的濾速提
升策略，在不同 pH 値之下通氣與ㄧ般過濾相比，其淨濾速皆有ㄧ定的提升，於 pH 値 3 之下，
其淨濾速較一般過濾相比可提升 6 成左右，因此可知通氣過濾不但可移除膜面之濃度極化
層，防止 BSA 粒子吸附於薄膜上，也不需耗費多餘的濾液來清洗薄膜，為一極為經濟之濾速
提升策略。 
 
四、結論 
(1) 通氣可增加膜面流體的擾動，提升膜面流體的剪切力，並可降低溶質與膜面接觸的機會，
使溶質粒子吸附的情況減少。

Fig. 2. Cross-sectional membrane morphology of the PSf hollow fiber prepared with no air gap. Magnification: (A) 500 and (B) 30,000×.
The major difference between Figs. 3 and 4 is the air-gap length
required for the resuppression of macrovoids: 40 cm in the case
of 70% relative humidity but 50 cm in the case of 30%, indicating
that the higher humidity in the air gap shortens the air-gap length
required for the resuppression.
The dependence of membrane morphology on air-gap length
was also investigated when the relative humidity in the air gap
was raised to 90%. The results are presented in Fig. 5. Similarly,
with increasing air-gap length, the macrovoids occurred, disap-
peared, reappeared, and redisappeared. With a relative humidity
of 90%, the air-gap length required for the resuppression of
macrovoids is shorter compared with the two previous cases:
30 cm versus 40 cm (70%) and 50 cm (30%). Moreover, the air-
gap length required for the first suppression is also shorter: 5 cm
versus 10 cm. The results show that the higher humidity in the
air gap shortens the air-gap length required for suppression of
macrovoids, for both the first suppression and the resuppression.
For clarity the air-gap length needed to completely suppress
macrovoids is listed in Table 2.

membrane morphology is the result of the solidification of the
polymer-rich phase that forms the membrane solid matrix dis-
playing a more or less asymmetric porous structure considering
the formulation and process parameters.
Actually there are different ways to induce demixing of a
polymer solution by NIPS according the non-solvent physical
state, i.e. liquid non-solvent-induced phase separation (LIPS)
and vapor-induced phase separation (VIPS). The latter method,
first patented in 1922 for the preparation of cellulose ester
membrane [2], consists of the exposure of the cast film to
a non-solvent containing atmosphere prior to immersion in a
coagulation bath. During this process, the non-solvent (usually
water) is introduced by the gas phase and its absorption by the
polymer solution leads to the phase separation. Films with a cel-
lular morphology are generally obtained using VIPS as shown
for instance for polycarbonate/[dioxane/DMAc] [3], polysul-
fone/DMF [4], polysulfone/NMP [5], [chlorinated polyvinyl
chloride/PVP]/[THF/n-butyl alcohol] [6] and poly(ether-imide)

angles needs more elaboration. Water was added in the 16 wt%
PEI/NMP solution and the resulted ternary solution was cast to
form a film, of which the water contact angle was measured. It
was observed that, although the addition of water made the water
contact angle lower, it could not be lowered to zero. On the other
hand, a liquid film without polymer (a film of NMP) had a zero
water contact angle, believed to result from the high affinity of
NMP for water. Actually it was found that the contact angle was
zero for cast films containing less than 4 wt% of PEI. Therefore,
it is believed that the observation of zero water contact angles
indicated that the polymer concentration at the film surface was
less than 4 wt%, much lower than that in the bulk (16 wt%). In
other words, during membrane forming, there occurred a liquid
layer near the film surface, and the polymer concentration in
the layer could be lower than 4 wt%. Obviously, the results of
water contact angle confirm the emergence of a surface liquid
layer on the cast film. It was also observed that the cast film was
whitened, indicative of phase separation, after 4 min of exposure
to the humid air. With this information and the data shown in

Simulation of Force on Membrane Surface of Cross-flow 
Microfiltration 
國科會計畫：NSC 95-2221-E-032-051 
ㄧ、中文摘要 
在本研究中乃利用側流(side-stream)的構思，
希望改變濾室中的流力狀態，使膜面上的剪應力
有所改變。因此針對實驗所得到濾速値以及使用
計算流力(computational fluid dynamics, CFD)軟體
加以模擬，探討是否會有改善薄膜結垢的情形、
和觀察膜面上之剪應力的變化情形。進而達到提
升濾速的效果。另外，過濾阻力值也使用 CFD 軟
體模擬出，加以探討說明。 
關鍵詞：模擬、掃流微過濾、結垢、薄膜 
Abstract 
The major factors influencing cake formation as 
well as the overall filtration resistance were found to 
be the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the 
membrane. In this work the simulating geometry of 
the cross-flow microfiltration was established, the 
meshes were constructed, and the boundary 
conditions were set, then the velocity field, the total 
filtration resistance, and the shear force distribution 
on the membrane surface could be calculated directly. 
The force analysis on the membrane surface is a tool 
for decaying fouling rate on the membrane and 
improving the efficiency of the cross-flow 
microfiltration.  
Keywords: Simulation, Cross-flow Filtration, 
Fouling, Membrane, Microfiltration 
 
二、緣由與目的 
在固液分離程序中，濾室內的流體力學變化
對過濾的效果影響甚距，因此許多學者針對流體
力學上的變化，加以研究分析。其中，Deen(1987)
利用流體力學觀點去廣泛的研究、分析粒子在孔
洞中的移動。Drew et al.(1991)研究出在多孔邊界
的輸送管中，微小的懸浮球體在層流狀態下的流
體力學效應，與快速流動下之間的關係。Hwang et 
al.(1995)以流體力學和粒子間作用力之動量平衡
模式，來分析粒子在濾面上之受力情形。許多學
者試著將濾室內的流力狀態加以改變，經研究發
現確實對濾速有所影響，其中 Millward et al.(1995)
於膜面附近設立增進擾流之障礙物以提升濾速。
Ma et al.(2000)合併脈衝逆洗與膜面改質(surface 
modification)技術，在低懸浮液濃度與短時間操作
下可得到更好的濾速。Kuberkar and Davis(2001)
比較掃流過濾與逆洗之不同，指出掃流過濾可減
低外部濾餅(external cake)生成的速率，而逆洗對
內部結垢(internal fouling)有較佳的處理效果。 
 
三、實驗方法與數值計算 
材料與方法 
實驗所使用的粉體為聚甲基丙烯酸甲酯
(ploymethyl methacrylate，PMMA)，粉體的外觀為
白色粉末，然而，經由掃描式電子顯微鏡(SEM)
觀察其形狀接近球形。粉體的粒徑為 0.8 μm，含
水率為 0.5 %，粒子密度(ρp)為 1190 kg/m3。過濾
所使用的濾膜材質為 Mixed cellulose ester，乃親
水性濾膜，其最高操作溫度為 55℃，平均孔徑為
0.1 μm，孔隙度約為 74 %，濾膜厚度為 125 μm，
濾膜直徑為 142 mm。操作實驗前預先配好懸浮溶
液，把輸送 pump 打開，將懸浮溶液經循環系統輸
送至濾室中，調整浮子流量計(Rotameter)來控制

過濾膜的澄清濾液，由收集容器經電子秤讀出重

致與基本構造相同，唯有在懸浮液的輸送上，由
一股物流分作為兩股物流，則因不同操作條件加
以調整流量計與閥件，來控制流量多寡。

間的增加而減小，代表濾餅隨時間有漸密的趨勢。而濾餅阻力則是隨著過濾時
間的增加而增加，此結果也可說明濾餅孔隙度的減小，由於過濾時間漸長，膜
面上的粒子也累積的越多，所以使濾餅產生了越大的阻力。過濾時有乾淨薄膜

果可說明施加電場仍對此類系統之濾速提昇仍有顯著助益，尤以高掃流作用時更是明顯。

濾液品質及能源效率之探討 
表2為SiO2懸浮液電場過濾之掃流速度對於濾液濁度的影響，在未施加電場時，其濁度值
皆降至個位數左右，以SiO2懸浮液(水溶液)實驗而言，此處理程序之濾液即可直接回收再利
用；而在施加電場後，其濁度皆已降至1附近，在外加電場掃流微過濾之後，再經RO或UF處
理應是可行的。而對於含IPA溶劑之懸浮液系統，當施加電場後，濁度更是低於0.2，即濾液
 89
表3為SiO2懸浮液電場過濾之能源效率，以SiO2/Water 懸浮液而言，未施加電場時較高掃
流速度者之能源效率較好，但於電場強度作用下，其能源效率受掃流速度影響漸小。而於
SiO2/IPA懸浮液系統，其結果指出掃流速度的增加雖可降低電能消耗，但若要大幅提升能源
效率，施加電場乃是較符合經濟效益之作法。 
 
結論： 
1. 針對SiO2懸浮液(水溶液)實驗，在電場強度5000~10000V/m時，擬穩態濾速約可提高24~46
倍，而其電滲透流速約為電場作用時擬穩態濾速之75~86%。 
2. 脈衝電場操作所得之平均濾速約為固定電場與未施加電場兩者濾速的平均值。 
3. 於施加電場掃流過濾操作下，其電能效率甚高於未施加電場者，所得之濾液濁度亦比自來
水標準值低，可直接回收利用於一般用水上。 
4. 對於SiO2/IPA廢液仍可以電場促進其濾速及提升濾液品質，且以固定電場操作較宜，對於
此類廢液，若以外加電場掃流微過濾作前處理，可有效地去除懸浮粒子，再結合後續薄膜滲
透蒸發及膜蒸餾等操作，預期此程序在溶劑回收再利用上之應用有其發展的潛能。
