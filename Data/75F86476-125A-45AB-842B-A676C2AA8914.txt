Abstract 
The satellite images record the earth activity from the artificial satellite. Recently years, the reaction 
technology is to change with each passing day. Satellite image resolution already arrives meter degree, 
especially full color image resolution even under the one meter. In order to increase the quality and usability 
of the high resolution satellite image, the pre image processing must be used in satellite applications. The 
proposed method has two parts. The first part is discussed the compression and encryption algorithm in the 
high resolution images on the satellite. This wavelet-based algorithm adapt to the user requirement. Simply 
executable and lower memory requirement are the major technique developments in the satellite image 
processing field. The second part is discussed that how to increase the image quality and how to eliminate the 
cloud layer or air suspensions noise for increasing image recognizing efficient. Finally this method compares

shown to achieve near-optimal minimax rate over a large range of Besov spaces. Second, for the generalized 
Gaussian prior assumed in this work, the optimal soft threshold estimator yields a smaller risk than the 
optimal hard threshold estimator. The soft threshold method yields more visually pleasant images over hard 
threshold because the latter is discontinuous and yields abrupt artifacts in the recovered images, especially 
when the noise energy is significant. Choice of threshold T decides denoising effect, many researches decide 
threshold T in statistics. In [1], Tessens et al. proposed a new context adaptive image denoising by modeling 
of curvelet domain statistics. Based on an inter-frame statistical analysis of curvelet coefficients, the algorithm 
distinguishes the coefficients into two classes: one represents the useful content and the other is dominated the 
noise. Using a prior model based on marginal statistics, an appropriate local spatial activity indicator for 
curvelets has been developed that is found to be very useful for image denoising. In this paper, the histogram 
distribution of curvelet coefficients in each frame at the second and third scales is modeled as GGD and we 
develop the frame-adaptive filter to denoise in DCuT coefficients. In the statistical Bayesian literature, many 
works have concentrated on deriving the best threshold based on priors such as the Laplacian and a mixture of 
Gaussians [4-7]. With an integral approximation to the pixel-wise MSE distortion measure as discussed earlier, 
the formulation is also Bayesian for finding the best soft threshold rule under the generalized Gaussian prior. 
A related work is [7] where the hard threshold rule is investigated for image with Laplacian and Gaussian 
distributions. 
 
 Proposed Method  
 Noisy Classification 
The noises are included speckle noise, Gaussian noise, and salt & pepper noise. First we classify the 
noise types with a heuristic method. The proposed algorithm uses a simple and fast statistic method to classify 
the noises. Formula (7) is used to decide if the salt & pepper noise or not. If the image is covered with the salt 
& pepper noise, the absolute values of the differences are large and the number of the large values is also 
great. In Tab. 1, if the value close to zero, the image is not covered the salt & pepper noise. The image is 
covered with the salt & pepper noise that include the value 255 and 0. Therefore, the median filter is efficient 
to eliminate the salt & pepper noise.

And then the Gaussian and speckle noises are diminished in curvelet domain. These are difficult to 
classify, we use the sum of the gradient to classify. It is a heuristic method in one hundred images. The sum of 
the gradient is about between 1150000 and 2180000 in the image that is covered with speckle noise. And that 
is about between 2790000 and 3660000 in the image that is covered with Gaussian noise. The majority 
medical images are generally covered with the speckle noises. Tab. 2 shows the sum of the gradient in these

Figure 4 and Fig. 5 show the histograms of all orientations at two successive scales. The histogram 
distributions of the curvelet coefficients against the generalized Gaussian curve. The distributions are 
characterized by a very sharp peak at zero amplitude and extended tails to both sides of the peak (leptokurtic). 
This leptokurtic behavior is observed on all histogram distributions of all orientations and scales in all images 
of our test set. This implies that the curvelet transform is very sparse, as the majority of coefficients have 
amplitudes close to zero.

Which is a function of the parameters xσ andβ . To our knowledge, there is no closed form solution for T* this

the GGD model. The proposed threshold )(T xB σ has been found to work well for the general case.

=σ is not only nearly optimal but also has an intuitive appeal. The normalized 
threshold )(T xB σ is inversely proportional to the standard deviation xσ and proportional to the noise standard 
deviation σ . When,
xσ
σ is smaller, the signal is much stronger than the noise, )(T xB σ is chosen to be small in 
order to preserve most of the signal and remove some of the noise. In the same way, when
xσ
σ is bigger, the 
noise dominates and the normalized threshold is chosen to be large to remove the noise which has 
overwhelmed the signal. Thus, this threshold choice adapts to both the signal and noise characteristics as 
reflected in the parameters xσ and σ . Since the β values in the curvelet coefficient distribution are all falls in 
the range [0~ 0.5], that means the relationship between )(T xB σ and β  is not obvious. Therefore the threshold 
)(T xB σ depends only on the standard deviation and not on the shape parameterβ . This simple form of the 
threshold )(T xB σ is proposed.

Conclusions 
Denoising technology is an important operation in image processing. According the noise characteristics, 
the proposed method separates the medical image into three types. The salt & pepper noise are easy to deal 
with median filter in spatial domain. This paper proposes the position-adaptive filter and frame-adaptive filter 
to eliminate the additive noises in curvelet domain. Because the histogram distribution of the curvelet 
coefficients is not GGD at the first scale, the proposed method uses position-adaptive filter to eliminate the 
noise in local region. And the frame-adaptive filter is used in the other frames. Furthermore, the histogram 
distribution of the curvelet coefficients is GGD in these frames at the second and third scales and the
