 parameters to compute the statistical solution. 
The stochastic analysis can be easily solved 
through a numerical procedure once the 
transition matrix of the system has been 
obtained [3]. The probabilistic characteristics 
of the stochastic parameters are obtained by 
the perturbation method and the results are 
checked by Monte Carlo simulation, also, the 
reliability analysis of structure is performed 
based on certain failure criteria of the 
structure [4]. 
In this study, the stochastic beam can be 
stated referring to the simple beam in Figure 
1. The Bernoulli-Euler beam is modeled as a 
uniform beam with viscous damping, which 
is initially considered as free of any load, and 
is horizontal at the equilibrium position 
under its own weight. To perform the 
dynamical analysis of the mathematical 
model developed for the passenger-
vehiclebridge interaction, only linear models 
are assumed to represent both the vehicle 
suspension systems and the bridge dynamics. 
Finally, the response statistical characteristics 
of the simple beam subjected to a moving 
oscillator with stochastic initial velocity and 
vehicle body mass are evaluated in order to 
show the great accuracy of the proposed 
approach. Some statistical responses obtained 
by the perturbation method are checked by 
the Monte Carlo simulation, also, the 
reliability analysis of the structure is 
performed based on certain failure criteria of 
the structure. 
2. DETERMINISTIC ANALYSIS 
We can rearrange the governing equations 
to form a system of (n+6) second order 
coupled differential equations with time-
varying coefficients. Obviously, the two 
coefficients D1 and D2 and the eigen-
functions ))(( 1 ti ξφ  and ))(( 2 ti ξφ  represent 
these time-varying coefficients in the 
governing equations of motion. These 
equations can be represented in the state 
space form very readily as follows: 
)()()()( tttt VGzBz +=&       (1) 
3. STOCHASTIC ANALYSIS 
In this case, we assume initial velocity (v) 
and sprung mass (ms) of the moving 
oscillator to be uncertain to make their 
characterization in probabilistic sense. The 
equations governing the problem possess 
both random force and coefficients, and 
therefore the response becomes a random 
process. Denoting by E[v] and E[ms] the 
mean value of initial velocity and moving 
sprung mass for the vehicle, and by βi the 
fluctuation of ith (i=1,2) uncertain parameter 
with respect to its mean value and under the 
assumption that 1<<iβ , the random 
variables are described by the following laws 
of variation: 
 )1]([ 1β+= vEv         
)1]([ 2β+= ss mEm       (2) 
Here βi is assumed as uniformly 
distributed random variables with zero mean. 
For simplicity, it is noted that E[β1 β2] is 
assumed as zero in the present study although 
the assumption is not necessary. 
In this paper the mean-value perturbation 
approach for the case of linear time 
dependent system with random coefficients is 
applied. This method requires: (i) the use of 
Taylor series expansion of the uncertain 
parameters (generalized inertia, damping, 
stiffness matrices and forcing vector), 
truncated to the second order terms, (ii) the 
transformation of the first order stochastic 
differential equations into a set of first order 
deterministic differential equations. 
According to the philosophy of this method, 
keeping track of the relationship (2) and 
introducing the vector β of uncertain 
parameters, the coupled system of equation 
(1) is rewritten in terms of state variables as 
follows:
