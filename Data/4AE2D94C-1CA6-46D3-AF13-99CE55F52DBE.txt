Stability Analysis to Optimal Finite Precision IIR
Filter Implementations: A Study of ECG Filtering
Hsien-Ju Ko, Jeffrey J.P. Tsai, Fellow, IEEE, and Ching-Haur Chang
Abstract—In this paper, we propose an approach to analyze
and minimize fixed-point arithmetic errors including both quan-
tization and computation effects for optimal digital IIR filter
implementations. Based on the derived fixed-point statistical
model, the nonlinearity produced by roundoff and computation
errors are expressed in terms of word-length. To minimize fixed-
point arithmetic errors, eigenvalue sensitivity measure is adopted
to derive a cost function to evaluate the finite word-length
(FWL) effects of the digital IIR filters with respect to fixed-point
implementations. We prove that an optimal IIR filter realization
obtained from normal-form transformation is corresponding to
the minimal eigenvalue sensitivity measure. Furthermore, we
develop a stability criterion in terms of word-length to guarantee
the stability of the optimal digital IIR filters. Finally, A numerical
example of ECG Filtering problem is provided for illustrating the
practicability as well as the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

length, eigenvalue sensitivity, stability, ECG
I. INTRODUCTION
Digital filters are widely used in many engineering applica-
tions, in particular, the fields about communication and control
engineering. However, not all analog signals can be exactly
implemented by the digital schemes since the undesirable finite
word-length effects will be occurred during A/D processes
and/or in the registers of a CPU. In some applications, the
signals are faint and result in degenerated accuracy after
digitization. For example, in most industrial products such as
robots, devices of communications, controllers of automobiles,
etc., and hence, considering FWL effects is essential. Recently,
ubiquitous healthcare (U-healthcare) is becoming an attractive
research area of increasing human welfare. Many biological
meters or sensors are attempted to be microminiaturized,
such as sphygmomanometers, ECG sensors, and clinical ther-
mometers, etc. However, the undesirable noise may associate
with the measured signals in such meters or sensors. Hence,
adopting a proper filter to eliminate the noise has played an
important role to effectively reduce the cost of the biological
meters or sensors. In this paper, FWL IIR filter implementa-
tions are discussed. On the one hand, IIR filters are with the
merits of computation saving and sharper frequency response,
but on the other hand, the disadvantages of finite-precision
errors and stability issues need to be taken into account[1].

Finite word length effects have been an important topic
in hardware implementations and widely discussed in many
literatures. Wilkinson [2] first proposed an algebraic analysis
for rounding errors in digital machines, either in fixed or
floating-point computations. In general, fixed-point arithmetic
are with lower costs, lower complexity of implementations,
easier for programming and higher operational speed, etc.
There exist infinite realizations corresponding to the same
transfer function of a digital filter, and yield the same stability
and performance. However, the digital filter with different
state-space realizations may have different output performance
when these structures are implemented in digital computers
with FWL. The undesirable FWL effects may degrade the
performance or even make the output signal divergent of
the digital filters. Therefore, selecting a proper realization
may improve robustness of the digital system under FWL
consideration. Chen and Kuo [3] first proposed a sufficient
stability condition in terms of word-length of a digital filter
under floating-point implementations using small gain theory
and the Bellman-Grownwall Lemma to determine the word-
length to guarantee the stability of the FWL digital filters.
However, such a criterion is complicate and conservative
since selecting the filter realizations properly has not been
done. Related works in controller implementations can be
found in [4] Recent years, sensitivity measure methods for
finding the optimal state-space realization are proposed. These
methods are effectively to deal with all digital linear systems
under FWL effects especially the digital control systems [4]-
[10] and digital filters [11]-[21]. The authors [4]-[5], [8]-[9]
proposed analytically algebraic methods for solving an opti-
mal transformation to achieve the minimal sensitivity subject
to FWL effects for digital control systems. However, using
Bellman-Grownwall Lemma for the word-length estimations
in the above mentioned papers is still required. Normal-form
matrices are with some interesting properties that makes them
attractive to be the candidates for state-space realizations for
eliminating limit cycle and minimizing FWL effects [10], [13]-
[14]. In contrast to the previous works, if one can obtain the
system matrix as normal-form realization 1 via some similar
transformation, the conservativeness of the stability criterion
in terms of word length will be highly eliminated. In addition,
the complexity of mathematical derivation can be reduced as
well. In fact, to find a controller such that the entire closed-
loop system matrix that is normal is still an open problem.
This issue can be a further research.
1A normal-form matrix satisfies that the induced matrix-2 norm equal to
its spectral radius.

For obtaining specific quantization error bound to derive the
stability criterion in terms of word length W in (3), we have
the followings.
1) For the quantization errors, suppose that Pij is the
ijth element of a filter parameterization set P =
{A,B,C, d}. When FWL effects occur and no overflow
exists, we can have, for the worst case,
P˘ij = sgn(Pij)(|Pij |+2−Wf ), for Pij is not an integer.
(18)
where sgn(·) denotes the sign function of ·.
2) For computational errors, error bounds of the parameter
matrices are of the form ‖∆P‖2.
III. EIGENVALUE SENSITIVITY
To reduce FWL effects, sensitivity minimization approach
has been used in many literatures [5], [4]-[8], etc. Since
all eigenvalues of an ideal digital filter under FWL effects
may result in poor performance or even unstable. Eigenvalue
sensitivity minimization becomes one of the effectiveness
scheme against the FWL effects of a state-space realization. In
this section, we will show that sensitivity minimization can not
only offer the optimal filter implementation but also provides
the normal-form transformation to make the stability criterion
(33) available.
Lemma 3: Wu and Chen et al: Suppose that the system
matrix A in (1) is diagonalizable and let λk be the kth
eigenvalue of A . Then, we have
∂|λk|
∂A
=
Re(λkykx
H
k )
|λk| (19)
where xk, yk, and the superscript H denote the reciprocal
kth right and left eigenvectors of A, and complex conjugate
transpose operator, respectively. 
In practice, all eigenvalues of a digital filter will be
perturbed by FWL, hence, the sensitivity measure can be
considered as follows
Γ =
∥∥∥∥∥
n∑
k=1
∂|λk|
∂A
∥∥∥∥∥
2
. (20)
To achieve the mathematical tractability of (20), the follow-
ing inequality is needed:
Γ ≤
∥∥∥Y∥∥∥
2
∥∥∥X∥∥∥
2
(21)
whereX andY are the sets of right and left eigenvectors ofA,
respectively. For convenience, we define the upper bound of
Γ as Γ¯. Therefore, to tackle the FWL effects of a digital filter
and to find the corresponding optimal state-space realization
can be specifically formulated as the minimization problem as
Γ¯min = min
T
Γ¯ (22)
where T is some similar transformation of A. Thus, it is
expected that there exists an optimal similarity transformation,
T(opt), such that (22) is achieved, where
A(opt) = T
−1
(opt)AT(opt), B(opt) = T
−1
(opt)B,
C(opt) = CT(opt), d(opt) = d (23)
and the reciprocal right and left eigenvectors can be expressed,
respectively, as:
X(opt) = T
−1
(opt)X,Y = T
⊤
(opt)Y (24)
Lemma 4:Assume that X has n rows and is full row rank
and XXH is an identity matrix. Then the following equations
are satisfied
‖Y‖2‖X‖2 = ‖XHY‖2. (25)

Theorem 1:Let the similarity transformations for minimiz-
ing the Γ¯ be expressed as T(opt), we have
T(opt) =
(
XXH
)1/2
F (26)
where F is any arbitrary real orthogonal matrix.
Proof: The proof can be obtained based on Lemma 4 and
the method in Yu and Ko [8]. 
Theorem 2: If the system matrix A of the digital filter (1)
is transferred toA(opt) by using T(opt), the optimal realization
A(opt) is a normal-form realization, that is, ‖A(opt)‖2 =
ρ(A(opt)), where ρ(·) denotes the spectral radius (i.e the
maximal absolute value of all eigenvalues) of ·.
Proof: Based on Lemma 4, this proof is directly obtained
by the following computations.
‖A(opt)‖2 =
√
λmax(AH(opt)A(opt))
=
√
λmax(ΛHXH(opt)X(opt)Λ)
=
√
λmax(ΛHΛ)
= max
k
|λk| = ρ(A(opt)) (27)
This completes the proof. 
Theorems 1 and 2 show that the optimal transformation will
make the FWL digital filter with the optimal robustness and
the improved stability criterion available, simultaneously.
IV. STABILITY ANALYSIS FOR FIXED-POINT DIGITAL
FILTER IMPLEMENTATION
According to (2) and (11), the optimal FWL fixed-point
digital filter implementation can be characterized by
x˘(opt)(k + 1) = A˘(opt)x˘(opt)(k) + ∆M1
+B˘(opt)u˘(k) + ∆M2 (28)
y˘(k) = C˘(opt)x˘(opt)(k) + ∆M3
+d˘u˘(k) + ∆M4 (29)
where Mi, i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} are with stochastic elements
uniformly distributed on (−1, 1) and they are mutually in-
dependent.
Lemma 5: [22] The implemented optimal FWL digital
filter is stable if and only if
ρ(A˘(opt)) < 1, (30)

MANUSCRIPT SUBMITTED TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS-PART B: CYBERNETICS 5
different bit-number implementations are all within the
unit circle until the word-length is 1-bit long.
3) In the format of fixed-point arithmetic, the output signals
may be blocked due to underflow effect. This effect
can be observed by comparing Fig. 14 and Fig. 15. It
is caused by some parameters of output matrix C(opt)
are too small to represented as fixed-point numbers.
Fortunately, such drawback may be improved by us-
ing floating-point implementations, since floating-point
numbers are with larger dynamical range.
4) From the experimental results in Table II, one can
observe that some spectral radii of the digital filter using
shorter word-length implementations are within the unit
circle, whereas the longer word-length implementations
are not. Thus, the guaranteed stability criterion (33) may
be a useful tool to help engineers making decisions to
select proper digital processors that definitely ensure
the word-length being not a variable of influencing the
stability in some design cases.
5) This work may extend to the FWL controller problem,
however, to find an optimal controller subject to FWL
effects such that the closed-loop system matrix normal
is still an open problem.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
This paper demonstrates an improved approach to analyz-
ing and minimizing fixed-point arithmetic errors for digital
filter implementations based on eigenvalue sensitivity mea-
sures. We first proposed the statistical model of fixed-point
arithmetic. Further, an improved stability criterion subject to
the digital filter implemented under FWL effects is derived.
Base upon this criterion, the estimated minimal word length
corresponding to stability is also derived. This criterion avoids
the complicated derivations such as Chen and Kuo [3], Ko
and Yu [4] and provides an improved stability criterion to
release the conservativeness caused by the Bellman Grownwall
Lemma. Via sensitivity minimization approach, the normal-
form transformation is investigated, and this format has been
shown that it is the optimal structure against FWL effects.
Finally, an example is performed to illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed scheme.
