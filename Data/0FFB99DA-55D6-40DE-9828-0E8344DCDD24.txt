Abstract 
This project aims at developing the 
technologies of mechanical characterization of 
thin films, such as Young’s modulus, shear 
modulus, and residual stress, through the 
external electrical circuit behavior of the 
micro test-key.  Since the driving and 
見於一些學術性期刊的文獻中，吾人知結構
承受外力所產生之變形或動態特性的改變
與結構之幾何形狀與材料性質有關，故利用
適當的驅動方式與量測技術，再透過測試結
構的變形或動態特性與結構之幾何形狀及
材料性質的關係，即可推算出薄膜材料的機
械性質。由微結構行為反算薄膜機械性質之
核心技術包括“量測方法”及“驅動方
式”等二大技術。目前見於文獻中所採用之
量測方法主要為：雷射杜普勒干涉儀、
ESPI、顯微影像處理、直接量測電容-電壓
關係及臨界電壓特性者很少。而目前見於文
獻中所採用之驅動方式主要為：探針直接施
力、溫度變化、振動、磁場驅動、電場驅動。
上述的方法皆需要特殊的量測方法與驅動
方式，且必須針對不同的量測技術與驅動方
式，設計特殊且複雜的測試結構，因此無法
滿足即時監控與檢測薄膜材料的標準化檢
測技術之需求。 
為克服前述微奈米機電元件在研發過
程(包括：設計、製造、封裝、及系統整合
等步驟)中所面臨的瓶頸，可行的薄膜機械
性質量測方法必須具備的條件為： 
(1) 能夠在製程中進行的晶圓級(wafer level)
且非破壞性的量測方法； 
(2) 能夠運用現有 IC 的量測設備，而不需額
外的量測與驅動設備； 
(3) 能夠合乎實際製程所產生的非理想狀
況，如預變形及非均勻性斷面等情況，
達到定量且正確的薄膜機械性質反算
模型。 
欲滿足上述需求之最佳的解決方案即是以
電驅動的方式，量測微結構之電路行為來反
算薄膜機械性質，達到全電訊號(電壓、電
容)的薄膜材料機械性質檢測技術。如此，
便可在製程中進行晶圓級(wafer level)的非
破壞性檢測，且僅需運用現有 IC 的量測設
備即可，而不需額外的量測與驅動設備。 
三、研究目的 
本計畫之目的即是在發展一全電訊號
(電壓、電容)之薄膜材料機械性質檢測技
術，以電驅動的方式，量測微測試結構(micro 
test-key)之電路行為來反算薄膜機械性質。
欲檢測之材料參數包括：楊氏模數(Young’s 
modulus)、剪切模數(shear modulus)、殘留
應力(residual stress)等。可藉以反算薄膜材
料機械性質之電信號包括：吸附前的電容--
電壓變化、吸附瞬間的吸附電壓 (pull-in 
voltage)等。其中，在 94 年度的專題研究計
畫(NSC 94-2212-E-211-006)已成功研發出
藉由量測微懸臂樑測試結構在吸附前的電
容--電壓變化，萃取出薄膜材料之楊氏模
數。在未來二年內(95、96 年度)擬研發量測
微測試結構在吸附前的電容--電壓變化及吸
附時的吸附電壓(pull-in voltage)，以萃取出
薄膜材料之楊氏模數、剪切模數、殘留應力
等材料參數。 
四、文獻探討 
隨著半導體製程技術逐漸進步，目前許
多已商業化之微機電商品，已朝向更高的機
械性能方向發展。但欲提昇微機電商品之性
能，薄膜材料機械性質是不可忽略的關鍵因
素。薄膜材料之機械性質，包括有楊氏模數
(Young's modulus) 、 殘 留 應 力 (Residual 
stress)、蒲松比(Poisson’s ratio)、熱膨脹係
數…等。接下來，將針對過去對於薄膜材料
機械性質之檢測技術的文獻作概略性的分
類與回顧探討。 
4.1 薄膜材料之楊氏模數檢測技術 
1979 年，K.E.Peterson 利用半導體製程
技術製作複晶矽(Poly-silicon)的微懸臂樑，
並以週期性變化的靜電力驅動微懸臂樑，使
其產生週期性運動，再以雷射干涉儀量測微
懸臂樑之共振頻率，藉由已知微懸臂樑的結
構尺寸，推算出複晶矽之楊氏模數[18]。1991
年，L.M.Zhang 等人亦以相同的萃取方式，
於真空環境之下量測單晶矽之楊氏模數
[19]。1992 年，L. Kiesewetter 等人分別使用
雷射光、聲波以及壓電致動器三種不同驅動
方式驅動微結構，以萃取微結構之楊氏模數
[20]。此類均為施加外力於微結構之上，量
測微結構之共振頻率，以萃取微結構之楊氏
沉積前後之微懸臂樑的曲率半徑變化，來回
推待測薄膜的殘留應力大小。1996 年時，
再 提 出 以 微 懸 臂 樑 的 邊 界 旋 轉 效 應
(Boundary rotation)及微懸臂樑之曲率半徑
分別量測薄膜的均佈應力(Uniform stress)及
梯度應力(Gradient stress) [39]。 
另外，1989 年 Najafi 等人提出以靜電
吸附法萃取材料之機械性質，其利用微橋狀
結構受靜電負載時而發生吸附現象時的吸
附電壓(Pull-in Voltage)來得到微結構的機
械性質 [22]。1995 年 Zou [24]更進一步延伸
Najafi 等人提出之靜電吸附法，首先提出以
兩個不同長度的微測試結構之比較，可得微
結構之楊氏模數與殘留應力的構想，但並未
實驗成功。1997 年 Senturia 提出 M-Test 的
萃取技術 [25]，應用大量之數值模擬歸納出
靜電吸附時的吸附電壓與微結構機械性質
之經驗公式，據以萃取出材料之楊氏模數與
殘留應力。Senturia 與 Gupta [26]利用半導體
製程技術，以單晶矽和複晶矽作為微結構之
材料，可同時萃取結構之楊氏模數與殘留應
力。 
1999 年，Schweitz [40]以萃取同平面
(in-plane)形變方法，藉由槓桿機構放大形變
量。其技術為利用檢測樑(Test beam)在釋放
殘留應力後將薄膜殘留應變轉化成長度方
向的變化量，再透過機構轉換以及指標樑
(Indicator beam)將薄膜殘留應變放大為形變
量，然後經由微游標尺規讀出形變量值，即
可回推出薄膜的殘留應力值。Wylde [41]則
是利用聲波驅動微結構，使微結構產生週期
性運動，再以 Rayleigh’s quotient 分析微橋
狀結構的動態響應，並計算出微橋狀結構的
第一共振頻率與殘留應力及楊氏模數的趨
近式。2002 年 Pamidighantam 提出以商用模
擬軟體工具，將系統模擬為一等效彈簧與平
行電板之離散系統(lumped system)，其中等
效彈簧勁度乃是以分析或實驗方法求得
[42]。2003 年 Mahony 等人[43]亦以有限元
素模擬軟體建立微橋狀結構受靜電力驅
動，並考慮微機電元件作動時的一些機電效
應以及不同的邊界條件，建立一個結合理想
狀況的理論，以更精確預測真實結構之吸附
電壓。 
綜合 4.1節與 4.2節之文獻探討，如表 1
所示，可得知目前大部分採用的驅動方式以
靜電驅動為主，量測方法則以光學干涉量測
為主。檢測的薄膜材料性質，以楊氏模數與
殘留應力為主。 
五、研究方法 
5.1 微測試結構之電彈力學理論模型 
本研究以尤拉樑(Euler beam)模型以及
最小能量法(Minimum energy method)為理
論基礎，推導出具殘留應力(residual stress)
之微型樑(micro beam)在承受靜電負載下的
電彈力學(electromechanics)理論模型及吸附
電壓(pull-in voltage)的解析解。該理論模型
考 慮 微 結 構 的 非 理 想 邊 界 (non-ideal 
boundary conditions) 、雜散電場 (fringing 
fields)、殘留應力、及微結構的預變形
(pre-deformation)等效應。理論模型與實驗量
測的誤差百分比小於 3%。本計畫所建立之
微結構的電彈力學理論模型已發表多篇SCI

前亦有二件相關的中華民國專利申請中，申
請案號為 96138188[16]與 96219925[17]。 
六、結果與討論 
本計畫所建立的微結構電彈力學理論
模型與實驗量測的誤差百分比小於 3%。所
開發之“以微測試結構之電路行為萃取薄
膜材料之楊氏模數與殘留應力”的技術，經
實驗驗證用於萃取單晶矽、多晶矽、及金屬
材料的楊氏模數與殘留應力，誤差小於
5%。本計畫成果已發表 10 篇國際期刊論文
[1]--[10]，5 篇重要國際會議論文[11]--[15]，
以及申請二件專利[16][17]。 
本計畫所研發的檢測技術可分為二
種，一為“以微測試結構之吸附電壓反算楊
氏模數與殘留應力”，二為“以微測試結構
在吸附前的電路行為反算楊氏模數與殘留
應力”。吸附(pull-in)現象乃是微結構在承
受靜電場作用下的不穩定現象，當動電壓達
到一臨界值(即吸附電壓)時，結構會瞬間崩
潰而被吸引到下電極。故量測吸附電壓的優
點是其信號較大，而缺點則是不易精確擷取
到該不穩定點(即吸附點)。微結構在吸附前
的電彈力學行為屬穩定平衡，故其優點是檢
測結果較穩定，缺點則是量測信很小，需解
決量測雜訊的問題。 
七、結論 
本計畫所欲建立的全電訊號之薄膜材
料機械性質檢測技術，將對於微機電產業，
從設計、製造、封裝、乃至系統整合等所面
臨的瓶頸，帶來重大的突破。預期將會對我
國產業競爭力帶來重大的提昇。以知識供應
鏈觀念為基礎的技術轉移方式，一直是佔我
國企業總數 98%以上之中小企業在發展
MEMS 產業的策略上不可或缺的準則。而培
育足夠且具跨領域專業背景的學生或工程
師，以滿足技術轉移與產業發展所需，即為
我國學術界及研發單位所特別強調之重點
工作。本計畫參與之相關人員透過製程訓
練、理論分析、及實驗驗證的過程，可培養
出具備技術能力、跨領域的理論基礎、及實
現設計理念等全方位能力的專業工程師，成
為我國微機電產業的生力軍。

E and 0 represent Young’s modulus and residual stress, re-
spectively. The coefficients  and  depend on the geometry
of beam and the permeability of dielectric medium. x is
the first natural mode of a beam clamped at the both ends.
The geometrical parameters b, h, L, and I represent beam
width, thickness, length, and area inertia moment of beam
cross section, respectively.  is the permeability of dielectric
medium. The deflection of beam causes the change of ca-
pacitance. The following capacitance equation correlates the
capacitance with the deflection of test beam, which is de-
rived based on the model of Meijs and Fokkema.27

In Eq. 4,  represents deflection, which is a dependent
variable that varied by the capacitance C. By measuring
the capacitance C of a beam subjected to a bias voltage V,
one can solve Eq. 4 to get the value of  via the numerical
method such as the simple iteration method. For a beam
subjected to bias voltage V, there are two unknowns in
Eq. 1, i.e., 0 and E. Therefore, we need two test beams
with different lengths to get the two unknowns. For two test
beams that are made of the same material but with different
lengths L1 and L2, they are in the same Young’s modulus and
residual stress but in different capacitances and the coeffi-
cients  and . Then, one can extract Young’s modulus and
residual stress by the following equation:
0E 
 = 1 12 2	−1V2V2
 . 5
To verify the present method, the authors conduct an experi-
ment to test Young’s modulus and residual stress of sputtered
aluminum beams. We make two aluminum-beam sample
groups by surface micromachining on silicon wafer; each
group contains three beams with different lengths. The two
sample groups are fabricated by individual sputtering process
on the individual silicon wafer that is coated with the sacri-
ficial layer of S-1813 photoresist. Among the two sample
groups, one group is with residual extensional stress, while
the other with residual compressive stress. We measure the
capacitance variation of each beam under the increasing bias
voltages, and then extract Young’s modulus and residual
stress by Eq. 5. Figure 1 shows the SEM pictures of a
finished clamped-clamped test beam. The inset of the SEM
image appears to show a little bit of the beam buckling at
anchor point; this is presumably the compressive aluminum
film. It should be mentioned that the typical surface-
micromachining anchors might soften the clamped-clamped
boundary conditions and cause a measurement deviation
from the ideal clamped boundary conditions. Lishchynska
et al.28 establish a criterion to judge the significance of the
effects of supports. For structures with physical dimensions
lying in the condition ha /Lh /r30.01, in the case of
most surface-micromachining structures h=r, the anchor can
be thought to be ideal clamped boundary, where ha and r are
the height and thickness of anchor, respectively. Thus, we
design the test beams lying in the foregoing condition. Table
I lists the parameters of the aluminum clamped-clamped test
beams. We use the same sputtering parameters to deposit
aluminum film on bare silicon wafer to serve as the experi-
ment control. Then, the standard values of the residual
stresses are measured by Kosaka ET-4000AK Surfcorder
that is a three-dimentional surface roughness/contour mea-
surement instrument. The pickup resolution is 0.05 nm in
the z direction. The straightness of the x-y stage is
0.1 m/100 mm in the x direction and 5 m/150 mm in the
y direction. The residual stress is calculated by the radius of
curvature before deposition and after deposition. The alumi-
num film is deposited directly on a bare silicon wafer for the
radius of curvature measurement. The sacrificial layer under
the released aluminum beam is S-1813 photoresist for ex-
tracting residual stress. Therefore, the standard value of the

vibration method adopts comb drives, piezoelectric shakers
or acoustic wave to vibrate the micro test structure. The
pulsed laser light can also be used to excite micro beams
[24, 25]. The force/pressure method uses the AFM (atomic
force microscope) probe or nano indentor to apply a force on
the micro test structure or apply barometric pressure on the
test membrane. The thermal method heats the test structure
to deform. The pre-deformation method does not need any
actuation while it makes use of the deformation induced
by large initial stresses. Interferometer is a very common
apparatus in measuring the deformation or vibration. AFM
and SEM (scanning electron microscope) can also be used to
measure the deformation. Micro strain gauges are developed
to measure the deformation. Some literatures use XRD (x-ray
diffraction) to measure the indentation imprint. The pull-in
method detects the pull-in voltage of micro test structures.
Among these aforementioned techniques, the most common
test structures are beams and diaphragms. Ring-type test
structures have also been reported while their fundamental
principles behind are very complicated, and they are difficult
to fabricate.
All the aforementioned techniques require additional
measurement and actuation instruments or complicated test
structure design and hence are not compatible with IC
metrology technologies. The motivation of the present paper
is to develop a method to extract Young’s modulus and residual
stresses of the structural material of MEMS devices, especially
for the common capacitive devices; moreover, such a method
is expected to be compatible with the wafer-level testing in
IC industry. Therefore, the best choices of test and pickup
signals are both electrical. In addition, the associated test
structure should be simple to fabricate. To satisfy all the
requirements, we select the electrostatic actuation method
and detect the pull-in voltage of micro test beams. We
design a simple test structure that contains two micro bridges
with different lengths. Both the fabrication and extraction
algorithms are very simple but accurate enough. As shown
in figure 1, one can attach the test structure aside each die
in the fabrication process to implement wafer-level testing
of each die. The extraction algorithm considers the fringing
field capacitance as well as the distributed deformation of the
test beams. The required measurement instrument is only
an Agilent 4285A precision LCR meter. We demonstrate
three common structural materials for MEMS devices: mono-
crystalline silicon, poly-silicon and aluminum. The extracted
Young’s moduli and residual stresses agree very well with
experimental measurements.
Figure 1. Schematic of the idea of MEMS wafer-level testing.
2. Algorithm development
The correlation between pull-in voltage and material
parameters must be formulated quantitatively to realize the
idea of extracting mechanical properties from electrical
signals. Osterberg [7] and Gupta [8] have done the important
achievements of extracting material properties of thin films
through detecting the pull-in voltage of micro test beams.
They first derived a simpler functional form of pull-in voltage
based on a simple lumped model. Their lumped model
simulates the micro beams subjected to electrostatic loads
as a flat plate capacitance suspended by a linear spring.
However, the simpler functional form deviates far from the
reality since the distributed deformation of test beams and
the electromechanical coupling effects are oversimplified.
Therefore, they conducted massive numerical simulations,
measured a large amount of beam-type test structures with
different lengths and then obtained a more precise formula
by modifying their previous functional form with many
correcting factors through curve-fitting numerical simulation
and measured data. Unlike their method, we develop an
algorithm analytically based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam
model and the fringing filed capacitance model proposed by
Meijs and Fokkema [26]. Our method requires only two micro
test beams with different lengths to extract Young’s modulus
and residual stress simultaneously. The section below details
the derivation process.

In equation (12), we neglect the effect of Poisson’s ratio.
Figure 3 shows the deviation of the present pull-in voltage
solution, which is 1% smaller than the measured data. One
can replace E by ˜E = E/(1 − ν2) in equation (12) so that
the effect of Poisson’s ratio is considered. However, Poisson’s
ratio is usually uncertain in real situation. Fortunately, by the
appropriate geometrical design of test beams, we can minimize
the influence of Poisson’s ratio on the extraction of Young’s
modulus and residual stress.
2.3. Algorithm for extracting Young’s modulus and
residual stress
For a given beam with the pull-in voltage VPI, there are two
unknowns in equation (12), i.e. σ0 and E. Therefore, we need

the (1 1 0) crystalline plane. Young’s modulus of

the two beam samples are 10 MPa [7].
two test beams with different lengths to get the two unknowns.
For the two test beams made of the same material but with
different lengths, they have the same Young’s modulus and
residual stress but different pull-in voltages and different S
and B parameters. Then, one has two equations:{
S1σ0 + B1E = V 2PI 1
S2σ0 + B2E = V 2PI 2.
(15)
By rearranging equation (15), the residual stress σ0 and
Young’s modulus E are given as the following matrix

One can extract Young’s modulus and residual stress easily
by substituting the measured pull-in voltages of the two test
beams with different lengths into equation (16).
3. Comparison with published works
3.1. Mono-crystalline silicon
Osterberg [7] has measured pull-in voltages of numerous
fixed–fixed beams with different lengths. We selected
Osterberg’s measured data randomly and substituted them into
our algorithm to verify the validity of the present method.
Table 2 lists the geometrical parameters and pull-in voltages
of the selected fixed–fixed beams which are made of mono-
crystalline silicon. There are two groups of fixed–fixed
beams listed in table 2; each group contains three beams with
different lengths. The difference of the two groups is only
the crystalline plane of cross section. The first group is in
the (1 0 0) crystalline plane while the second one is in the
(1 1 0) crystalline plane. We selected two beams from each
group and substituted the measured data and beam dimensions
into equation (16) to extract Young’s modulus and residual
stress. Tables 3 and 4 list the extracted Young’s modulus and
residual stress of mono-crystalline silicon in (1 0 0) and (1 1 0),
respectively. It is shown that the extracted values of the present
algorithm agree well with Osterberg’s results [7].

layers. Both layers are 0.5 µm thick. These insulation layers
were then patterned in the second step. The purpose of this step
is to define the length of the fixed–fixed beam and the probing
pad of the ground plane. In the third step, S-1813 photoresist
was spun-on to serve as the sacrificial layer and to define the
initial gap between the test beam and ground plane. In the
fourth step, an aluminum film was deposited by sputtering.
The RF sputtering recipe is the argon flow rate of 25 sccm, the
chamber pressure of 2 mTorr and the RF power of 100 W. In
the fifth step, AZ-P4620 photoresist was spun-on to serve as
the etching mask and then the aluminum film was etched to
form the beam structure. The fabricated beam was released by
removing photoresist with acetone in the last step. Figure 5
shows the SEM pictures of the finished bridge-type beam.
Table 7 lists the geometrical parameters of the aluminum
fixed–fixed beams. It should be noted that the typical
surface-micromachined anchors might soften the fixed–fixed
boundary conditions and cause a measurement deviation from
the ideally fixed boundary conditions. Lishchynska et al
[29] reveal that the effect of non-ideal boundary conditions
depends on the geometrical parameters of beam and supports.
The role of the support is thought to be non-significant if
it contributes less than 5% to the total deflection. They
establish a criterion to judge the significance of the effects
of supports. For structures with physical dimensions lying
in the condition (ha/L)(h/r)3 < 0.01, where ha and r are
the height and thickness of anchor respectively, the anchor

can be considered as ideally fixed. Since h ≈ r in most
surface-micromachined structures, our design of the test beams
is within (ha/L)(h/r)3 < 0.01 and hence the ideally fixed
boundary condition applies.
4.2. Pull-in voltage detecting
We detected the pull-in voltage by tracking the capacitance
sensitivities with respect to applied bias voltages. Two low
noise probes touch the two probing pads of the test beam, as
shown in figure 4. The probes are connected to the Agilent
4285A high precision LCR meter. The Agilent 4285A can
supply a test signal of 30 mV/1 MHz riding on the bias
voltages ranging from 0 to 40 V. Its capacitance measurement
resolution can achieve 0.01 fF. It should be noted that the
frequencies of test signal must avoid the resonant frequencies
of test beam to prevent resonance. Agilent 4285A exports the
capacitance-voltage data to a personal computer and tracks the
capacitance sensitivities to the applied bias voltage. Figure 6
shows the schematic of the experiment setup for the pull-
in voltage detection. Figure 7 shows the typical measured
capacitance sensitivity results. Table 7 lists the detected pull-
in voltages of each beam of every sample group.
5. Results and discussions
The only difference between the two sample groups is the
residual stress; the first sample group is with the tensile
residual stress of 28.61 MPa while the second is with the

Abstract
This paper derives a high precision analytical solution to determine the
pull-in voltages of a micro curled beam subjected to electrostatic loads. The
analytical model considers the fringing fields between the micro curled
beam and the ground plane as well as the initial curling induced by the stress
gradient. Furthermore, the electromechanical coupling effects are also
involved in the present analytical model. Then the analytical solution of
pull-in voltage is obtained by the energy method. By comparing with the
other published analytical models as well as the experimentally measured
data, the accuracy of the present analytical solution is verified to be more
accurate than the other published works. The present analytical solution can
determine the pull-in voltage with a maximum deviation of 1% from the
experimentally measured results as the ratio of the beam length to the width
is greater than 5.

1. Introduction
The electrostatic principle is a very commonly used principle
in sensing or actuating devices of microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS). There are many examples of
micromachined devices making use of electrostatic
deformation and/or pull-in of beams or diaphragms for
sensing or actuating purposes, such as micromachined
inertia sensors [1], capacitive pressure sensors [2], comb
drivers [3], micro pumps [4], inkjet printer head [5], RF
switches [6], etc. Besides, the pull-in voltages of micro test
structures can extract the material parameters of thin films,
such as Young’s moduli and residual stresses [7, 8]. The
design of micromachined electrostatic devices is complex due
to the fact that the electrostatic forces will alter the dynamic
characteristics of the structure [9, 10], which is the
phenomenon of structural stiffness softened by the
electrostatic force, and that the electrostatic charges
will redistribute as the structure deforms and thereby
change the electrostatic forces’ distribution. Thus, such an
electromechanical coupling effect becomes an important
issue in the design of the micromachined devices utilizing
the electrostatic principle. The nonlinear electrostatic force
gives rise to the well-known pull-in phenomenon that causes
beams or diaphragms to collapse on the ground if the applied
voltage exceeds a certain limit namely the pull-in voltage.
Determination of the pull-in voltage is critical in the design
to determine the sensitivity, instability and the dynamics of
devices. Accurate determination of the pull-in voltage is very
challenging in virtue of the electromechanical coupling effect
and the nonlinearity of electrostatic force. Effects such as
the fringing field and the initial curling induced by the stress
gradient further complicate the modeling.
The finite element method (FEM) is often used for
modeling the pull-in phenomenon and has been implemented
in various commercial MEMS simulation software such as
ANSYS, COMSOL, CovnetorWare and Intellisuite. However,
FEM has the disadvantages of inexplicit physical meaning
and requiring massive numerical calculations. In contrast,
the analytical model can provide a better insight into the
physical characteristics of devices. A simple lumped model
was often used formerly to simulate the electrostatically

proposed by Meijs and Fokkema can compute the capacitance
much faster than the others do and the error is small enough,
of the order of 2% as the ratio of the line width to gap greater
than 1 and the ratio of the line thickness to gap within 0.1 and
4. Before the implementation of the micro deflectable beams
in the pull-in analysis, the fringing field capacitance model
must be modified since the gap between the beam and the
ground plane varies with the position x. For an infinitesimal
beam element with length dx, the capacitance differential dC is
given on the basis of the empirical formula proposed by Meijs
and Fokkema [23] as

is the fringing field capacitance due to the free end of the

stress gradient. For a curled cantilever beam with the initial
radius of curvature ρ, the initial gap between the beam and the

It should be mentioned that we are accounting for problem
nonlinearities only in the electrostatic part of the model.
Indeed, the beam structure is assumed to be linearly elastic,
without any consideration of geometrical nonlinearity in virtue
of large deformation; moreover, the initial curling of the
beam is taken into account in the initial gap, which enters the
electrical potential energy, but not in the mechanical energy.
3. Analytical solution to the pull-in voltage
The exact solution for the electrostatic-actuated beam is
difficult to obtain since it is a nonlinear system with the
nonlinear electrostatic force coupled with the structural
deflection. Thus, such a problem is often solved by the
approximate analytical solution, which is often referred to
as the assumed mode method in structural vibration [21]. By
the use of the assumed mode method, the deflection function
w(x) is expressed as
w(x) =
n∑
i=1
ηiφi(x), (6)
where φi(x) is the ith assumed deflection shape function
satisfying the boundary conditions and the coefficient ηi
to be solved is the associated modal participation factors.
Then substituting the assumed deflection function, i.e. the
equation (6), into the system energy expression, one can
solve for the coefficient η. Since the natural mode is the
exact solution to the free vibration of structures, it essentially
satisfies the boundary conditions and the homogeneous part
of the governing equation of a dynamic system [21]. Thus,
the natural modes form the foundation for forced response
calculations in structural dynamics [21]. The author adopts
the first natural mode of the cantilever beam as the assumed
deflection shape function instead of the foregoing polynomial
functions. Moreover, the electrostatic loads will attract the
cantilever beam downward to the ground plane; this kind of
deformation is similar to the first natural mode of a cantilever
beam. For a cantilever beam, both the deflection and rotation
angle are zero at the clamped end, and both the moment and
transverse shear force are zero at the free end, i.e.
w(0) = w′(0) = 0, and w′′(L) = w′′′(L) = 0. (7)
The first natural mode of a cantilever beam is
φ(x) = (cosh λx − cos λx) − σ(sinh λx − sin λx), (8)
where
σ = sinh(λL) − sin(λL)
cosh(λL) + cos(λL)

Gupta’s measured data [8], the error of the present analytical
solution is smaller than 1% as the ratio of the beam length to

the analytical model in [15] is valid only for shorter beams
since it is a straight beam model, which neglects the initial
curling of the cantilever beam. Moreover, the analytical
solution given by [16] deviates far from Gupta’s measured
data despite considering the initial curling. Its error, relative
to the Gupta’s measured data [8], increases up to about 30%,
as shown in figure 4. The accuracy and precision of the present
analytical solution is much better than the former works and
has extremely high precision as the ratio of the beam length to
beam width is greater than 5.

The authors conduct an experiment to verify the present
analytical solution of the pull-in voltage. Three testing beam
samples with different lengths are made of RF sputtered
aluminum films. As shown in figure 5, the cantilever beam
is formed by etching the sputtered aluminum film. The

RF sputtering process parameters are the argon flow rate of

ground plane. At the fixed end of the cantilever beam, there is
a dielectric layer between the cantilever beam and the ground
plane. The dielectric layer consists of two materials, that is, a
Si3N4 layer over a SiO2 layer and both have the thickness of
0.5 µm. The photoresist serves as the sacrificial layer to
release the aluminum cantilever beam. Figure 6 shows
the SEM picture of the finished aluminum cantilever beam,
which is curled by virtue of the stress gradient. Table 2
lists the geometrical and material parameters of the test
beam samples. The initial radiuses of curvatures of the
test beam samples are obtained by SEM. The beam will be
deflected downward the ground plane by the electrostatic
attraction force, which leads to the increase of deflection
or capacitance. Many published works diagnose the beam
to be pull-in as the deflection is reaching one-third of the
initial gap. However, such a deflection criterion deviates
far from the reality; moreover, it requires extremely precise
displacement measuring equipment. As the bias voltage
reaches the pull-in voltage, the beam collapses down to the
ground plane, which induces a large increase in capacitance.
Therefore, one can detect the pull-in voltages via directly
observing the capacitance variation or via detecting Ohmic
contact after pull-in. However, it is not easy to catch the
pull-in voltage precisely since the pull-in phenomenon is
an unstable equilibrium point. The cantilever beam will
collapse down to the ground plane suddenly as the voltage
reaches the pull-in voltage. Moreover, the Ohmic contact
occurs after the exact unstable equilibrium point. Thus, the
authors try to track the capacitance sensitivities with respect
to the applied bias voltages instead of directly observing
the capacitance or detecting the Ohmic contact. Two low
noise probes probe on the two probing pads of the ground

Abstract
This paper derives an approximate analytical solution to the pull-in voltage
of a micro bridge with elastic boundaries. The analytical model considers
the elastic boundary effect, fringing field capacitance, residual stresses and
the distributed flexibility of the bridge. The accuracy of the present
approximate analytical solution is verified by comparison with the
simulation results of commercial FEM packages and other published
closed-form solutions as well as experimental measured data. The deviation
of the present approximate analytical solution is within 5% for a wide beam
and a narrow beam in a small deflection regime. The present approximate
analytical solution has explicit physical meaning and is highly accurate for
device design.

1. Introduction
The electrostatic principle is a very commonly used principle
on sensing or actuating devices of microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS). There are many examples of
micromachined devices making use of electrostatic
deformation and/or pull-in of beams or diaphragms
to achieve sensing or actuating purposes, such as
micromachined inertia sensors [1], capacitive pressure
sensors [2], comb drivers [3], micro pumps [4], inkjet
printer head [5], RF switches [6] and resonators [7] etc.
Besides, the pull-in voltages of micro test structures can be
used to extract the material parameters of thin films, such
as Young’s moduli and residual stresses [8, 9, 10]. The
design of micromachined electrostatic devices is complex
by the fact that electrostatic forces will alter the dynamic
characteristics of the structure [11, 12], which is the structural
stiffness softened by electrostatic force, and that electrostatic
charges will redistribute as the structure deforms and thereby
change the electrostatic forces distribution. Thus, the
mechanical-electrical coupling effect becomes an important
issue in the design of micromachined devices making use
of the electrostatic principle. Nonlinear electrostatic force
gives rise to the well-known pull-in phenomenon that causes
beams or diaphragms to collapse on the ground if the drive
voltage exceeds a certain limit, namely the pull-in voltage.
Determination of the pull-in voltage is critical in design to
determine the sensitivity, instability and dynamics of devices.
Accurate determination of pull-in voltage is very challenging
in virtue of the mechanical-electrical coupling effect and
the nonlinearity of electrostatic force. Effects such as the
non-ideal boundary conditions, fringing field and initial
residual stress further complicate the modeling.
The finite element method (FEM) is often used for
modeling the pull-in phenomenon and has been implemented
in various commercial MEMS simulation packages such as
CovnetorWare, Intellisuite and COMSOL. However, the FEM
has the disadvantages of un-explicit physical meaning and
requiring massive numerical calculations. In contrast, an
analytical model can provide a better insight into the physical
characteristics of devices. A simple lumped model was
often used formerly to simulate electrostatically actuated
microstructures as it consists of a single parallel plate capacitor
suspended by an ideal linear spring [3, 13]. The lumped model

where E denotes Young’s modulus. We simulate the flexible
anchor as an equivalent torsional spring with constant k, that
is M = kθ . By equations (1) and (2), one has
k = M

. (3)
By the assumption that the cross-section of the anchor is
identical to the bridge, i.e. Ia = I , then k = 4EI/La .
3. System energy
Consider an Euler–Bernoulli beam with initial residual stress
σ0 and constant cross-section, as shown in figure 1(b); the
mechanical strain energy Um is given by
Um =
∫ L

In equation (4), the first term is the strain energy induced by
initial residual stress, the second term is the bending strain
energy and the third term is the potential energy of elastic
boundaries.
The fringing fields are considerable and must be taken into
account when modeling the electrostatic loads. A technical
report [24] conducted by Leus and Elata summarizes several
different formulae for computing fringing field capacitance.
Among the fringing field models mentioned by [24], the one
proposed by Meijs and Fokkema [25] can compute capacitance
much faster than the others and the error is small enough to
the order of 2% as the ratio of line width to gap is greater
than 1 and the ratio of line thickness to gap is between 0.1
and 4. Before implementation into the pull-in analysis of
micro deflectable beams, the fringing field capacitance model
must be modified since that the gap between the beam and
the ground plane varies with the position x. The details are
described in the author’s published work [26]. Then the total
electrical potential energy Ue is given by

dx, (5)
where V is the electrical potential, g is the initial gap
between the beam and ground and ε is the permittivity of the
dielectric between the beam and ground. In the integrand of
equation (5), the first term is the ideal flat plate capacitance,
the second term is a length-dependent adjustment parameter,
the third term is the fringing field capacitance due to the beam
width and the fourth term denotes the fringing field capacitance
due to the beam thickness. The total potential energy U of
the system equals the sum of mechanical strain energy and
electrical potential energy, i.e.,

It should be mentioned that we are accounting for
nonlinearities only in the electrostatic part of the model.
Indeed, the beam structure is assumed linearly elastic, without
any consideration of geometrical nonlinearity in virtue of large
deformation. It is very difficult to obtain an exact solution to
pull-in voltage because of nonlinear electrostatic terms. We
expand the electrostatic terms in equation (6) by Taylor’s series
with respect to the initial equilibrium position, i.e. w = 0,
and truncate the fifth- and higher-order terms based on the
assumption of small deflection. Therefore, the total system
potential energy U becomes

5. Model verification and discussion
The accuracy of the present approximate analytical solution
is verified by extensively comparing it with definitive
commercial FEM package results and experimental measured
data. The results from the closed form solutions mentioned
in the introduction section are also presented in a comparative
manner.
A beam is considered wide when b  5h [8]. Wide beams
exhibit plane strain conditions; therefore Young’s modulus E
should be replaced by the effective Young’s modulus ˜E =
E
/
(1 − ν2) and the residual stress σ0 should be replaced by the
effective residual stress σ˜0 = σ0(1 − ν). To verify the present
approximate analytical solution for a wide beam in a small
deflection regime, we adopt the seven test cases published in

Figures 3–7 show the results from the present approximate
analytical solution and experimental measurements and the
deviations compared with each other. Obviously, the
present approximate analytical solution agrees very well with
experimental measurements.
6. Conclusions
A straightforward approximate analytical solution is
developed to determine the pull-in voltage of an
electrostatically actuated micro bridge. The model accounts
for the elastic boundary effect of the anchor, the fringing
field capacitance between the continuously flexible bridge and
ground plane, residual stress, and the distributed deformation
of the bridge. The present solution is verified extensively by
comparison with the experimental measurement, FEM results
and other closed-form models. The present analytical model
has the advantage of explicit physical meaning and is generally
applicable to a wide/narrow beam in a small deflection regime.

Abstract—The ZnO pyroelectric sensors with partially covered 
electrode were adopted to discuss the correlation between its voltage 
responsivity, morphology and mechanical properties of the thin film. 
The sensor based on pyroelectric thin-film fabricated by sputtering 
with RF power of 120W was revealed larger voltage responsivity 
than those of 150W and 90 W for 10~400 times. The surface 
morphology reveals less defects and uniform grain size for the RF 
power of 120 W as characterized by SEM. The effective elastic 
modulus and hardness of ZnO film sputtered with RF power of 
120W were significantly (P<<0.05) larger than that of 90W about 
21% and 32%, and 150W about 23% and 37% respectively. 
Therefore, the effects of sputtering power on the voltage responsivity 
of the pyroelectric sensor can be obtained as characterized by the 
SEM morphology and its mechanical properties.

I. BACKGROUND 
he pyroelectric thin-film sensor was fundamental building 
block in pollution monitoring, thermal imaging, radiometers, 
and gas sensors [1]-[5]. Thin-film pyroelectric sensors possess 
advantages as integrating with on-chip circuitry and its uncooled 
fashion [2], [4], [6]. Among the pyroelectric materials, ZnO has 
attracted much attention because of its excellent piezoelectric and 
pyroelectric properties, and can be used in optics and electronics 
devices. Besides, the ZnO has the same order of voltage figure of 
merit as Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3 (PZT) due to its low relative permittivity 
[6]. The partially covered electrodes (PCE) were used in order to 
improve the absorption efficiency of the pyroelectric sensors [6]. 
Besides the absorption issue, substrate, membrane layer, 
electrodes and pyroelectric layers are essential components of the

pyroelectric sensor, and their effects on frequency response of 
pyroelectric sensors are extensively studied [3], [7], [8]. However, 
rare study was conducted to investigate the morphology and 
mechanical properties of pyroelectric thin-film though the quality 
of the thin film is one of the most important elements in the 
pyroelectric sensors. 
The defects or vacancies of the ZnO film deposited by RF 
sputtering can be examined by the surface morphology obtained 
by SEM. Meanwhile, nanoindentation is a common method 
determining the mechanical properties of thin films [9]-[13]. The 
hardness and elastic modulus of thin films can be obtained from 
the load-displacement curve acquired from the indentation test. A 
power law function is used to fit the unloading segment, and then 
the contact stiffness is derived from slope of this function at 
maximum load. The slope can be used to determine the actual 
contact depth, and the indentation modulus and hardness can be 
derived [9]. In this study, the effects of sputtering power on the 
surface morphology and mechanical properties are discussed. 
Meanwhile, we investigate the correlation between the voltage 
responsivity and resulting mechanical properties, surface 
morphology. 
 
II. CURRENT RESULTS 
The thickness of ZnO thin film is a critical factor to 
responsivity of pyroelectric sensor due to the large temperature 
gradient for thicker ZnO layer [6], [14]. Therefore, the thickness 
of ZnO layer was controlled at about 450 nm to discuss the 
relations between the responsivity of pyroelectric sensor and 
mechanical properties of ZnO thin film. ZnO film with sputtering 
power of 120 W reveals less defects and uniform grain size 
compared with that of 150 W, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The 
defects or voids in ZnO thin film sputtered with RF power of 
120W were less and smaller than that of 90W and 150W, as 
shown in the inset of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The ZnO grains under RF 
power of 120W were uniform (~10 to 30 nm) whereas the grains 
for RF power of 90W were irregular ranged from 30~120 nm (not 
shown). The ZnO grains for RF power of 150W were regular in 
size with high density of defects, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3.

Abstract
This paper derives three analytical models, namely the full-order, the
fourth-order and the third-order models, and the corresponding closed form
solutions for the pull-in voltages of micro curled beams subjected to
electrostatic loads. The analytical models are derived based on the
Euler–Bernoulli beam theory and Taylor’s series expansion and are then
solved by the energy method. The accuracy of the present models is verified
through comparing with former analytical models and the experimentally
measured data conducted in former works. It is verified that the present
closed form solutions are more accurate than past works. This paper also
compares three commonly used assumed deflection shape functions and
shows that the natural mode of the beam is the best choice in predicting the
pull-in voltage. The present closed form solutions for the pull-in voltage are
very convenient and accurate enough for implementation in device design.

1. Introduction
The electrostatic principle is a very commonly used principle
on sensing or actuating devices of microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS). There are many examples of
micromachined devices making use of electrostatic
deformation and/or pull-in of beams or diaphragms to
achieve sensing or actuating purposes, such as micromachined
inertia sensors [1], capacitive pressure sensors [2], comb
drivers [3], micro pumps [4], inkjet printer head [5], RF
switches [6], etc. Besides, the pull-in voltages of micro test
structures can extract the material parameters of thin films,
such as Young’s moduli and residual stresses [7, 8]. The
design of micromachined electrostatic devices is complicated
by the fact that the electrostatic forces will alter the dynamic
characteristics of the structure [9, 10], which is the structural
stiffness softened by electrostatic force, and that the
electrostatic charges will redistribute as the structure deforms
and thereby change the electrostatic forces distribution. Thus,
such a mechanical–electrical coupling effect becomes an
important issue in the design of micromachined devices
with electrostatic principle. The nonlinear electrostatic force
gives rise to the well-known pull-in phenomenon that causes
beams or diaphragms to collapse on the ground if the applied
voltage exceeds a certain limit namely the pull-in voltage.
Determination of the pull-in voltage is critical in the design
to determine the sensitivity, instability and the dynamics of
devices. Accurate determination of the pull-in voltage is very
challenging in virtue of the mechanical–electrical coupling
effect and the nonlinearity of electrostatic force. Effects such
as the fringing field and the residual stress induced curling
further complicate the modeling.
The finite element method (FEM) is often used for
modeling the pull-in phenomenon and has been implemented
in various commercial MEMS simulation software such as
CovnetorWare, Intellisuite, Femlab and ANSYS. However,
FEM has the disadvantages of un-explicit physical meaning
and requires massive numerical calculations. In contrast, the
analytical model can provide a better insight into the physical
characteristics of devices. A simple lumped model was
often used formerly to simulate the electrostatically actuated
microstructures as it consists of a single parallel plate capacitor

where b, G, V, ε0 and εr represent the beam width, the initial
gap between the beam and the ground plane, the applied
bias voltage, the permittivity of free space and the dielectric
constant of the dielectric medium between the beam and the
ground, respectively. The cantilever beam will be curled by
the residual stress releasing. For a curled cantilever beam with
an initial radius of curvature ρ, the initial gap between the
beam and the ground plane can be expressed as
G = g0 + ρ
(
1 − cos x

)
, (3)
where g0 represents the gap between the fixed end of the
cantilever beam and the ground plane. Then, the total potential
energy is the sum of the bending strain energy and the electrical
potential energy, i.e.

The exact solution for the electrostatic-actuated beam
is difficult to obtain since it is a nonlinear system with
the nonlinear electrostatic force coupled with the structural
deflection. Thus, such a problem is often solved by the
approximate analytical solution, which is often referred to as
the assumed mode method in the structural vibration [20]. By
the use of the assumed mode method, the deflection function
w(x) is expressed as
w(x) = ηφ(x), (5)
where φ(x) is the assumed deflection shape function satisfying
the boundary conditions and the coefficient η to be solved
is the associated modal participation factors. Then substituting
the assumed deflection function, i.e. equation (5), into the
governing equation or the system energy expression, one
can obtain the coefficient η. Since the natural mode is the
exact solution to the free vibration of structures, it essentially
satisfies the boundary conditions and the homogeneous part
of the governing equation of a dynamic system [20]. Thus,
the natural modes form the foundation for forced response
calculations in structural dynamics [20]. The author adopts
the first natural mode of the cantilever beam as the assumed
deflection shape function instead of the foregoing polynomial
functions, since the natural mode satisfies the boundary
conditions and the homogeneous part of the governing
equation of a dynamic system essentially. For a cantilever
beam, the deflection and rotation angle are both zero at the
clamped end, and the moment and transverse shear force are
both zero at the free end, i.e.
w(0) = w′(0) = 0 and w′′(L) = w′′′(L) = 0. (6)
The first natural mode of a cantilever beam is
φ(x) = (cosh λx − cos λx) − σ(sinh λx − sin λx), (7)
where
σ = sinh(λL) − sin(λL)
cosh(λL) + cos(λL)
, (8)
and the coefficient λ satisfies the following equation,
cos(λL) cosh(λL) + 1 = 0. (9)
Substituting equations (5) and (7) into equation (4) gives

The system is in a static equilibrium when the first-order
derivative of the total potential energy U with respect to the
coefficient η equals zero [17, 18], i.e.

(11)
Whether the equilibrium is stable or unstable is determined by
the second-order derivative of the total potential energy with
respect to η. At the transition from a stable to an unstable
equilibrium, the second-order derivatives of the total potential
energy with respect to η also equal zero [17, 18], i.e.

Equation (16) is solved to get ηin by the numerical method
since it is the integral equation and is difficult to be solved
analytically. The full-order model is not very convenient
in application since it requires solving equation (16) by the
numerical method to get the coefficient ηin. Therefore, the
author tries to derive reduced-order models, namely the third-
and fourth-order models, to get the closed form solutions for
the pull-in voltage in the following sections.

solution represents the phase angle of the forced response to
external excitation. However, the complex solutions have no
physical meaning for a static system. The scope of the present
work focuses on the static equilibrium of a beam subjected
to electrostatic forces. Therefore, the complex solutions are
neglected.
5. Results and discussion
The present closed form solutions are verified by comparing
with the works conducted in [15, 16], as well as with
experimentally measured results of [8]. The geometric and
material parameters of the micro curled cantilever beams
are given in table 1 unless specified otherwise, which are
the experimental samples conducted by Gupta [8]. Gupta’s
experimental beam samples are made of polysilicon and
manufactured by the standard MUMPs 5 die process. Figure 2
shows that the present full-order model agrees very well with
Gupta’s measured results, no matter for longer or shorter
beams. The mean relative error to Gupta’s measured data is
about 4% among the experimental samples, as shown in table 2.
However, the model in [15] is valid only for a shorter beam
since it is a straight beam model, which neglects the curling
of the cantilever beam. Moreover, the model in [16] deviates
far from Gupta’s measured results. Its mean relative error to
Gupta’s measured data gets up to about 30%, as shown in
table 2. Figure 3 shows the comparison of the three closed

Gupta’s measured data. The one obtained by the uniform
load deflection function is medium, and the one obtained by
the square deflection function is the worst. In fact, the work
conducted in [16] exactly uses the square deflection function.
Consequently, figure 2 shows that the result conducted in [16]
is the worst. Figures 5 and 6 show the comparison of different
deflection shape functions for the fourth-order and the third-
order models, respectively. Both show that the lines obtained
by the first natural mode and the uniform deflection shape
function superimpose together. This phenomenon should be
attributed to truncating the higher order terms in the reduced
order models. Similar to the case of the full-order model, the
square deflection function is the worst choice since it does not
satisfy the boundary conditions fundamentally.
6. Conclusion
This paper derives three fully analytical models, namely the
full-order, the third-order and the fourth-order models, to
predict the pull-in voltage for a curled beam subjected to
electrostatic force. The present models are verified to be
more accurate than past works by comparing with the formerly
published analytical models and experimentally measured
data. Although the full-order model seems to be closer to
the experimental results than the other two reduced order
models, it yields an implicit function for the pull-in voltage.
The two reduced order models obtain explicit functions for
the pull-in voltage and are accurate enough. Thus, they are
very convenient and accurate enough for implementation in
MEMS design. This work also compares three commonly used
assumed deflection shape functions, namely the first natural
mode, the uniform load deflection function and the square
deflection function. For the full-order model, the first natural
mode of the cantilever beam is the best choice. For the two
reduced order models, the predicted pull-in voltages obtained
by the first natural mode and the uniform load deflection
function are almost the same. The square deflection function is
the worst since it does not satisfy the boundary conditions. The
assumed deflection shape function must satisfy the boundary
conditions fundamentally. This paper only illustrates the case
of the cantilever beam; however, the present closed form
solutions also apply to other boundary conditions, such as
fixed–fixed ends, as choosing the natural modes corresponding
to the different boundary conditions.

a suitable sacrificial layer is difficult. This is because the high
temperature treatment for PZT films to form the perovskite
phase would make the sacrificial layer difficult to remove.
To deposit the PZT film at room temperature so that the
perovskite phase is maintained, Akedo et al developed an
aerosol deposition method [16–23]. Its deposition rate of the
PZT film is higher than all of the aforementioned methods.
The thickness of the PZT film can be varied from 1 µm to more
than 500 µm. Silicon and stainless steel can be used as the
substrate for fabricating actuators [16, 17]. To pattern a PZT
film, Akedo et al used a shadow mask in the deposition step
[18]. Although it is simple and convenient to employ a shadow
mask, the sidewall of their fabricated PZT layer exhibited
60◦ inclination [19]. In this paper, we integrate a special
lift-off process into the room temperature deposition method.
This process enables patterning thick PZT films of complex
configurations. The process parameters will be detailed.
2. Aerosol deposition method
The configuration of an aerosol deposition equipment in this
work is shown in figure 1. The aerosol deposition method is to
accelerate PZT particles to impact on the substrate with high
speed so that the PZT film can be produced due to particle
densification [20]. The detailed deposition mechanism can be
referred to Akedo’s work [21]. The entire deposition process
was operated at room temperature in this work. To accelerate
PZT particles, a differential pressure between the deposition
chamber and the powder chamber is applied. The suitable
range of the differential pressure is found to be within 13 kPa
and 40 kPa in our work.
The size of PZT particles is an important factor in the
patterning process. A smaller particle size can get finer surface
roughness and smaller line width of the PZT structure. In
this work, we used HCQ-type PZT powder (hard-doped PZT)
which was prepared by ELECERAM TECHNOLOGY Co.
This powder is usually used for piezoelectric transformers
Figure 2. Annealing profile of the PZT film deposited by the
aerosol deposition method.
because of its high mechanical quality factor. The average
diameter of HCQ particles is 500 nm. The deposition
parameters in this paper are given in table 1. The volume
concentration of powder in a gas stream of PZT particles
is 1.1 × 10−5. The deposition rate is controlled by the
moving speed of the X–Y stage (11 mm s−1) and the differential
pressure (20 kPa). In a 50 × 70 mm2 area, the deposition rate
is 5 µm h−1. The surface roughness of the deposited PZT film
of 10 µm in thickness is 100 nm.
Although the PZT film can be deposited at room
temperature and it already has a perovskite phase, the defects
between accumulated particles have caused low piezoelectric
constants. Therefore, the annealing process is still needed.
The typical annealing temperature for the PZT film is between
450 ◦C and 700 ◦C. The PZT microstructure cracks easily if
the annealing temperature is higher than 700 ◦C. For annealing
temperature lower than 450 ◦C, acceptable piezoelectric
constants have not been obtained. In this work, the annealing
temperature is set to be 600 ◦C. The annealing profile used is
given in figure 2. To avoid cracks in the PZT patterns, a long
heating process with slow heating and cooling steps for 42 h
is used.
The relation between polarization and the electric field of
the annealed PZT film of 6 µm in thickness is characterized
by using a ferroelectric analyzer (TF ANALYZER 2000,
aixACCT Co.). The measured hysteresis loop is given in
figure 3. The applied electrical field is 400 V cm−1 at 10 Hz.
The remanent polarization and coercive field are 8 µC cm−2
and 60 kV cm−1, respectively. The crystalline phases of PZT
powder and the deposited thick film with 600 ◦C annealing
temperature are characterized by x-ray diffraction. The result
in figure 4 indicates that the perovskite phase in the PZT
powder remains after the 600 ◦C annealing process. It is
found that there exists a pyroclore phase in the annealed film.
In addition to the hysteresis loop and crystal phase,
the permittivity and piezoelectric constant are also measured

Alternatively, we have found that the negative photoresist
THB-151N (JSR Micro Inc.) is difficult for the PZT particles
to penetrate and to deposit on. The photoresist THB-151N
also keeps the PZT structure intact after the lift-off process
and hence serves as a good sacrificial material.
Figure 6 details the aerosol deposition together with the
lift-off process by using the photoresist THB-151N. A 600 ×
1200 µm2 PZT beam pattern was fabricated in this case. First,
the 50 µm thick photoresist THB-151N is spin coated and
UV exposed to be the protection mask (figure 6(a)). Then a
10 µm thick PZT film is deposited on the substrate by the
aerosol deposition method (figure 6(b)). After PZT deposition,
the desirable PZT pattern is obtained by using acetone to
remove the THB-151N layer (figure 6(c)). Finally, the
annealing process is carried out. It is noted that PZT particles
do not adhere to the photoresist surface, as shown in figure
6(b). Figure 6(d) shows the 11 × 14 array of the fabricated
PZT beam pattern in the area of 50 × 70 mm2.
Various PZT microstructures have also been fabricated
using the developed lift-off process, as shown in figures 7(a)–
(c). By avoiding lateral undercut in the wet etching
process, the circular PZT disk with three supporting beams in
figure 7(c) can be easily realized using our approach. The
aspect ratio of the PZT microstructure in figure 7(d) is

measured to be 13:30. In our process, the smallest line width
of the PZT microstructure is limited to 30 µm if the thickness
PZT film is higher than 10 µm.
Based on the developed techniques, PZT double-layer
structures have also been fabricated by conducting lift-off
processes twice. The pattern shapes in the top and the bottom
layers can be different. The fabricated square PZT double-
layer structure is shown in figure 8. In this case, the thicknesses
of the top layer and the bottom layer are 8 µm and 30 µm,
respectively.
4. Results and discussions
In the experiment, it was found that the thickness of the THB-
151N layer was decreased while the PZT film was deposited.
Here, the thickness changes of the PZT film and the THB-
151N layer were both measured during the 3 h deposition
time. Figure 9 shows the thickness changes with increasing

5. Conclusions
A series of silicon-based PZT thick film fabrication processes
has been developed by an aerosol deposition method. The
negative photoresist THB-151N was found to be the suitable
sacrificial layer for the lift-off process. Although the PZT
particles would mill the THB-151N layer, complex shapes of
PZT structures can be patterned and vertical sidewalls can
be obtained. Based on the developed technique, multi-layer
PZT structures have been demonstrated by conducting lift-off
processes twice. This process might facilitate design flexibility
for PZT-based micro-actuators and micro-sensors.

where η is the absorption coefficient of radiation, P is the pyroelectric coefficient of the pyroelectric 
film, A is the sensing area, dtdT  is the temperature variation rate of the pyroelectric film. The higher 
temperature variation rate in pyroelectric film leads to a higher response current of the pyroelectric 
sensor. In this paper, the ZnO film is adopted as the sensing element to generate the pyroelectric 
signal. The ZnO film formed by the proposed two-step sputtering process has been observed to possess 
the growth characteristic of strongly preferred orientation toward the c-axis, which has succeeded in 
the application of film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) [6].  
The proposed ZnO pyroelectric sensor is fabricated by the process containing the backside-etching 
of silicon wafer, the dielectric layer deposition by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), 
the top and bottom electrodes deposition by e-beam evaporation, and the ZnO thin film deposition by 
radio frequency (RF) sputtering. The top electrode and the radiation absorption layer play very 
important roles in the overall performance of the pyroelectric sensor. According to the authors’ 
published work [5], the partially covered electrode (PCE) can reveal a higher responsivity than that of 
fully covered electrode. The uncovered part of ZnO film is directly exposed to the heat source, which 
can greatly improve the responsivity of the pyroelectric sensor in virtue of increasing the energy 
absorption. Moreover, a nickel layer is deposited onto the un-covered parts of the ZnO film to enhance 
the incident energy absorption and thus to improve the sensor’s dynamic response and device 
performance [7]. 
In the present ZnO pyroelectric sensor, a two-step RF sputtering process is used to deposit the ZnO 
film to improve the responsivity of ZnO pyroelectric sensors. The top electrodes cover the ZnO film 
partially. In addition, a nickel film deposited onto the uncovered part of the ZnO film is applied to 
enhance the absorption of incident energy. The experiment shows that the present fabrication process 
can significantly improve the performance of the ZnO pyroelectric sensor. 
2. Fabrication Process 
Figure 1 shows the fabrication process of the proposed ZnO pyroelectric sensor. A double-side 
polished p-type (100) silicon wafer is adopted as the substrate. Silicon nitride layers of thickness of 1 
μm are deposited onto both sides of the substrate by LPCVD to obstruct the thermal conduction to the 
substrate, which can increase the pyroelectric signal and responsivity of the sensing element. Then 
photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) are used to pattern the etch window at the bottom side 
of the substrate, as shown in Figure 1(a). Subsequently, the KOH solution of 45 wt% is used to etch 
the substrate until the remaining thickness is about 50 μm. The etching temperature is kept at 75 oC. 
Therefore, a cavity shown in Figure 1(b) is formed at the bottom side of the substrate to reduce or 
block the thermal loss from the ZnO layer to the substrate and ambient.

bonding pad of the bottom electrode, as shown in Figure 1(f). The recipe of the etching solution is 
CH3COOH: H3PO4: H2O=1: 1: 10. Figure 2 shows the finished ZnO pyroelectric sensor. 
The sputtering RF power significantly affects the ZnO film quality, and therefore affects the 
responsivity of the ZnO pyroelectric sensor. We use two-step sputtering process under different RF 
powers to achieve a better responsivity of the pyroelectric sensor. Three different RF powers are 
adopted to investigate the influences of the RF power on the responsivities of the ZnO pyroelectric 
sensors, namely 90 W, 120 W, and 150 W. The three different RF power make up nine different ZnO 
sputtering processes, as shown in Table 1. The deposition rates of the three different RF powers are 
1.22 nm/min for 90W, 2.02 nm/min for 120 W, and 2.63 nm/min for 150 W. For the two-step 
sputtering process, each step deposits a half of the required total ZnO film thickness. However, the 
samples No. 7–9 use a single power to deposit the required total ZnO film thickness.

is about 2 to 4 times than that of Sample 8. Though the two-step power processes with a higher power 
step followed by a lower power step can also improve the responsivity, the improvements are 
insignificant. 
We further deposit the nickel layers of thickness of 10 nm onto the uncovered parts of the ZnO 
layer, as shown in Figure 5. It should be mentioned that a gap of 20 μm, as shown in Figure 5(b), 
between the nickel layers and the top electrodes is required to prevent the increasing of resistance. The 
resistance of nickel is larger than that of gold. If the top electrodes contact with the nickel films, then 
the resulting resistance of the top electrodes will increase. Therefore, a gap between the nickel layers 
and the top electrodes is required to prevent the increasing of resistance. The nickel layer can enhance 
the radiation absorption and therefore improve the sensing performance. As shown in Figure 6, the 
enhanced nickel layer significantly improves the responsivity of the ZnO pyroelectric sensor for a 
higher modulated frequency. In general, the voltage responsivity of pyroelectric sensors will decline as 
the modulated frequencies increase. Therefore, one can use the nickel layer to enhance the energy 
absorption and thus reduce the decline of voltage responsivity at higher frequencies.

A Closed Form Solution for the Pull-in Voltage of the
Micro Bridge

Abstract
This paper derives a closed form solution with fringing filed effects for the pull-in voltages of
the micro fixed-fixed beam subjected to electrostatic loads and initial stress. The closed form solution
is derived based on the Euler’s beam theory and the energy method. The accuracy of the present closed
form solution is verified through comparing with the experimentally measured data of the published
literatures. The error of the present closed form solution is within 1% compared to the measured data.
The present closed form solution is more accurate than the past works and is very simple and highly
accurate for implementation in the design of MEMS.
Key Words: Electrostatic, Fringing Field, MEMS, Pull-in Voltage
1. Introduction
The electrostatic principle is a very commonly used
principle on sensing or actuating devices in MEMS. It can
also be used to extract the material parameters of thin
films [1,2]. The nonlinear electrostatic force gives rise to
the well-known pull-in phenomenon that causes beams or
diaphragms to collapse on the ground if the applied volt-
age exceeds a certain limit namely the pull-in voltage. De-
termination of the pull-in voltage is critical in the design of
MEMS devices. Accurate determination of pull-in voltage
is very challenging in virtue of the electromechanical
coupling effect and the nonlinearity of electrostatic force
[3,4]. Effects such as the fringing field and the initial re-
sidual stress further complicate the modeling.
The finite element method (FEM) is often used for
modeling the pull-in phenomenon and has been imple-
mented in various commercial MEMS simulation soft-
ware. FEM has the disadvantages of un-explicit physical
meaning and requiring massive numerical calculations.
On the contrary, analytical model can provide a better in-
sight into the physical characteristics of devices. A sim-
ple lumped model was often used formerly to simulate
the electrostatically actuated microstructures as it con-
sists of a single parallel plate capacitor suspended by an
ideal linear spring [1,6]. However, the simple lumped
model deviates far from the reality in virtue of ignoring
the electromechanical coupling and the fringing field, as
well as the distributed deformation of structures. There
has been numerous works on analytical modeling of the
pull-in voltage for beams or diaphragms [1,2,710] which
develop from the foregoing simple lumped model with
the modified capacitance accounting for the fringing fie-
ld and the equivalent spring constant. Another kind of
analytical model is the distributed model based on well-
known beam and plate theories [6]. However, such dis-
tributed model has to solve the highly nonlinear govern-
ing equations. Some literatures [11,12] assume the de-
flection function of a cantilever beam as a square func-
tion of position and obtain that the pull-in occurs as the
tip deflection exceeds about half the original tip gap.
Some other analytical models [13,14] assume the deflec-
tion functions of electrostatically actuated beams as the
polynomial functions that satisfy the boundary conditions.
Then the analytical approximated solutions for pull-in
voltages are obtained via energy method. There still are
reduced-order distributed models that expand the nonlin-
ear electrostatic force term as Taylor series and truncate

4. Results and Discussion
The accuracy of the present closed form solution is ver-
ified by comparing with the measured data conducted by
the published works [1,2]. Three cases are demonstrated,
which are the poly-silicon bridges [2] manufactured by the
standard MUMP’s process and the mono-crystalline silicon
bridges [1] with the cross section in (110) and (100) crys-
talline plane and manufactured by bulk micromachining.
Table 1 lists the material and geometric parameters of the
demonstrated samples. Figures 2 to 4 show the results of
the foregoing three demonstrated samples. It is shown that
the closed form solution agree very well with the mea-
sured data conducted by the published works.

where E , I , L , and w  represent the Young’s modulus, the 
cross-sectional area moment of inertia, the length, and the 
deflection as a function of the position x respectively. The 
fringing fields, as shown in Fig. 2, are considerable and must 
be taken into account when modeling the electrostatic loads. 
Many different models for computing fringing field 
capacitance appear in literatures. A technical report [4] 
conducted by Leus and Elata summarizes several different 
formulas for computing the fringing field capacitance of on-
chip interconnect lines. Among the fringing field models 
mentioned by [4], the one proposed by Meijs and Fokkema [5] 
can compute the capacitance much faster than the others do and 
the error is small enough, which has the error of 2% as the ratio 
of line width to gap greater than 1 and the ratio of line 
thickness to gap within 0.1 and 4. Before the implementation 
into the pull-in analysis of the micro deflectable beams, Meijs 
and Fokkema’s fringing field capacitance model must be 
modified since that the gap between the beam and the ground 
plane varies with the position x. For an infinitesimal beam 
element with length dx, the capacitance differential dC is given 
based on the empirical formula proposed by Meijs and 
Fokkema as

B. Young’s Modulus and Stress Gradient Extraction 
The mechanical properties can be obtained by the 
correlation between the applied forces and the deformations of 
a structure. For example, the Young’s modulus is defined as 
the ratio of stress to strain. As applying a bias voltage, the 
beam will be deflected downward the ground plane by the 
electrostatic attraction force, which leads to the increase of 
capacitance. As the bias voltage reaches a certain limit, namely 
the pull-in voltage, the beam collapses down to the ground 
plane, which induces a large increasing of capacitance. The 
applied bias voltage is equivalent to the applied force and the 
capacitance is equivalent to the deformation. Equivalently, the 
mechanical properties can also be extracted from the 
correlation between the applied bias voltages and the 
capacitance variations. However, the capacitance of typical 
micro beams is too small to measure precisely. Therefore, we 
detect the pull-in voltage since the large increasing of 
capacitance at pull-in state is easier to be observed. Voltages 
and capacitances are electrical signals. Stresses and strains are 
mechanical quantities. The equivalence between the electrical 
signals and the mechanical quantities must be formulated 
quantitatively to realize the idea of extracting mechanical 
properties from the electrical signals. 
A closed-form solution of the pull-in voltage is derived 
using an assumed deflection shape function and the minimum 
energy method. The authors adopt the natural mode of a 
cantilever beam as the assumed deflection shape function in the 
derivation of the pull-in voltage of a beam subjected to 
electrostatic loads. The natural mode is the exact solution to the 
free vibration of structures. Thus, it essentially satisfies the 
boundary conditions and the homogeneous part of the 
governing equation of a dynamic system. The natural mode is 
the foundation for forced response calculations in structural 
dynamics [6]. Set the deflection function w(x) to be 
279
to cantilever-type testing structures. One can apply to other 
kind of testing structures provided changing the assumed 
deflection shape function to satisfy the corresponding boundary 
conditions. For example, one can design a bridge-type testing 
beam and adopt the first natural mode of a fixed-fixed beam as 
the assumed deflection shape function in the algorithm. It is 
expected that the present work will bring an important 
breakthrough to the bottlenecks faced by MEMS industry in 
design and the in-situ mechanical properties testing on 
fabrication.

respectively. D is the bending stiffness of the 
diaphragm, which has the form as

 The numerical results shown in Fig. 5 to Fig. 7 are 
obtained by the use of fifth order Runge-Kutta method 
with three modes expansion. Fig. 5 shows the 
maximum displacement of the central point in frequency 
domain and Fig. 6 shows the first modal resonant 
frequency variation versus the applied AC voltage 
amplitudes, both of them depict that the resonant 
frequencies decrease with the increasing magnitude of 
applied AC voltages. Fig. 7 shows the response of the 
central point of the circular diaphragm in time domain 
subjected to the AC voltages of 400 kHz with the 
amplitudes of 20 and 50 volts respectively. 
 
STABILITY ANALYSIS  
According to the dynamic analysis depicted in the 
previous section, the applied AC voltage may alter the 
dynamic characteristics of structures periodically, thus, 
in addition to the static pull-in phenomenon; the 
dynamic stability must be taken into consideration in 
design. We use the Floquet Theory to carry out the 
dynamic stability analysis [22]. 
 Consider the homogeneous part of Eq. (27), i.e. 
 [ ]{ } [ ]{ } { }0=+ YKYM &  (31) 
 
and set the two linear independent initial conditions as



By the Runge-Kutta method, one can obtained two 
linear independent homogeneous solutions of Eq. (31) 
in one period T, i.e. { }1)(TY  and { }2)(TY . The two linear 
independent homogeneous solutions construct the 
monodromy matrix [C] as 
 { } { }[ ]21 )(,)(][ TYTYC =  (33) 
 
The stability can be determined by the nature of the 
eigenvalues 
jµ  of monodromy matrix [C]. The system 
is stable if all the eigenvalues have magnitudes less 
than unity, i.e. 1<jµ , unstable if at least one 
eigenvalue great than one, i.e. 1>jµ , and marginally 
stable if at least one eigenvalue with unit magnitude 
and multiplicity less than unity. 
 It is known that, as the applied voltage is increased, 
the gap between the upper and lower electrodes 
decreases until an instability or collapse condition is 
reached, say pull-in. The solid line shown in Fig. 8 
represents the static pull-in voltage for different initial 
gap G while the dots represent the dynamic unstable 
region as subjected to AC voltages with the frequency 
of 550 kHz. As shown in Fig. 8, the dynamic instabilities 
appear in the region lower than the pull-in voltage. 
Therefore, in addition to the pull-in voltage, the dynamic 
instabilities must be taken into account in design. Fig. 9 
shows the numerical results of stability analysis in the 
lower frequency region. As shown in the figure, the 
instable regions appear near the multiples of resonant 
frequencies, say nω , nω2 , nω3 , …etc.. Furthermore, 
the instable regions expand with increasing applied 
voltage magnitude.

Abstract—This paper develops a rapid algorithm to extract the 
Young’s modulus and residual stress of structural material of 
capacitive micro-device from measuring the pre-pull-in 
capacitance variation of the micro test beam made of the material 
to be tested. The extracted Young’s modului and residual stresses 
of demonstrated samples agree very well with the experimental 
measurement. The present method is expected to be applicable to 
the wafer-level testing in micro-device manufacture and 
compatible with the wafer-level testing in IC industry since the 
test and pick-up signals are both electrical. 
Keywords- Electrostatic, MEMS, Residual Stress, Wafer-level 
Testing, Young's modulus  
I. INTRODUCTION 
The performance of micro devices depends on the 
constitutive properties of the thin-film structural materials of 
which they are made. It is known that thin-film properties 
differ from bulk material ones. As a result, certain material 
properties are critical in device performance that must be 
monitored in manufacture to ensure the repeatability from 
device to device and wafer to wafer. The most important thin-
film material parameters are Young’s modulus and residual 
stress [1]–[2]. There are many different test methods in the 
broad array of published material property extracting 
technologies for MEMS [2]. However, most of the property-
extraction methods for implementation in micro fabrication 
require additional testing equipments or complicated test 
structures, which are not compatible with integrated circuit (IC) 
metrology technologies. To realize wafer-level testing, the best 
choices of test and pick-up signals should be both electrical. 
Besides, test structure should be simple to fabrication. There is 
M-TEST method [3] that extracts the Young’s modulus and 
residual stress from the pull-in voltage of test beams. However, 
pull-in voltage is difficult to detect exactly in practice since it is 
an unstable equilibrium state. Hu [1], [4] had developed a 
method that measures the capacitance variation of micro test 
beams before pull-in. The behavior prior to pull-in is under 
stable equilibrium. Thus, detecting the electromechanical 
behavior of test beam before pull-in is more reliable and robust 
than at the pull-in point. Hu [1] had designed a simple test 
structure that contains two micro bridges with different length. 
One can attach the test structure aside each device during 
fabrication process, then implement wafer-lever testing of each 
device. The required measuring instrument is only an Agilent 
4285A precision LCR meter. However, the material parameters 
extracting algorithm of [1] requires numerical iteration to get 
the η  parameter. Therefore, we further develop in this paper a 
rapid and direct algorithm that has explicit functional form and 
does not need time-consuming numerical iteration. 
II. CAPACITANCE-DEFLECITON RELATIONSHIP 
Consider a micro bridge shown in Figure 1, which is of 
length L, width b, thickness h, and is separated from the ground 
by an initial gap g. As actuated by a drive voltage V, the 
electrostatic force causes a position-dependent deflection w(x). 
The deflection alters the gap between the test bridge and 
ground plane and therefore alters the capacitance value. Thus 
the capacitance variation is equivalent to the deformation of the 
test bridge. This section is to explore the relationship between 
capacitance variation and mechanical deformation. The 
capacitance of the flexible test bridge is given by [5]

the first term is the ideal flat plate capacitance, the second term 
is a length-dependent adjustment parameter, the third term is 
the fringing field capacitance due to the beam width, and the 
fourth term denotes the fringing field capacitance due to the 
beam thickness. We further expand it about the initial 
equilibrium position, i.e. w(x) = 0, and truncate the fourth and 
higher order terms based on small deflection assumption,

It should be mentioned that we are accounting for 
nonlinearities only in the electrostatic part of the analytical 
model. Indeed, the beam structure is assumed linearly elastic, 
without any consideration of geometrical nonlinearity in virtue 
of large deformation. The small deformation assumption is 
reasonable since the deflection of the test bridge before pull-in 
is within the small deformation regime. 
By the use of assumed mode method, substituting equations 
(3) and (4), into the total potential energy expression, equation 
(15), gives

The coefficients, α and β, depend only on the geometrical 
parameters and the permeability of dielectric medium. 
Equation (17) gives the relationship between the mechanical 
deflection and drive voltage of the test bridge while equation 
(11) gives the relationship between capacitance and mechanical 
deflection. Therefore, substituting equation (11) into equation 
(17) gives the relationship between the capacitance variation 
and drive voltage for the flexible test bridge subjected to drive 
voltage. 
IV. ALGORITHM FOR EXTRACTING YOUNG’S MODULUS 
AND RESIDUAL STRESS 
Equation (17) depicts an explicit functional relationship 
among capacitance, drive voltage, Young’s modulus E, and 
residual stress σ0 for a given test bridge. Therefore, by 
measuring the capacitance variations of a given test bridge 
subjected to drive voltages; one can extract E and σ0 of the test 
bridge from equation (17). However, there are two unknowns, 
σ0 and E, in equation (17). Therefore, we need two test bridges 
with different length to get the two unknowns. For two test 
bridges that are made of the same material but with different 
length L1 and L2, they are of the same Young’s modulus and 
residual stress but of the different coefficients α  and β  and 
capacitance when subjected to the same drive voltage. By 
measuring the capacitance variation of two test bridges, one 
can extract the Young’s modulus and residual stress form the 
following equation

V. EXPERIMENT VERIFICATION 
To verify the present algorithm, the authors conduct an 
experiment to test the Young’s modulus and residual stress of 
sputtered aluminum film. We make two aluminum-beam 
sample groups by surface micromachining on silicon wafer; 
each group contains three different lengths. The two sample 
groups are fabricated by individual sputtering process on the 
individual silicon wafer that is coated with the sacrificial layer 
of S-1813 photoresist. The fabrication process is detailed in the 
author’s published work [2]. Among the two sample groups, 
one group is with residual extensional stress, while the other 
one is with residual compressive stress. We measure the 
capacitance variation of each beam under increasing drive 
voltages. Then extract the Young’s modulus and residual stress 
by equation (20). 
Figure 2 shows the SEM pictures of a finished test bridge. 
It should be mentioned that the typical surface-micromachining 
anchors might soften the clamped-clamped boundary 
conditions and cause a measure deviation from the ideal 
clamped boundary conditions. Lishchynska et al. [8] had 
established a criterion to judge the significance of the effects of 
supports. For structures with physical dimensions lying in the 
condition ( ) ( ) 01.03 <rhLha , in the case of most surface-
micromachining structures h = r, the anchor can be thought to 
be ideal clamped boundary, where ha and r are the height and 
thickness of anchor respectively. Thus, we design the test 
bridges lying in the foregoing condition. Table I lists the 
parameters of the aluminum clamped-clamped test bridges.

2. DEVICE FABRICATION 
The proposed flexible PZT pyroelectric sensor device is 
made onto a flexible polyimide substrate, which is composed of 
a PZT layer sandwiched in between the top and bottom 
electrode layers, as shown in Fig. 1. We propose four designs of 
the top electrode layer, the crisscross type, the web type, the 
target type, and the rectangle type. The areas of the different top 
electrods are all the same except the rectangle type. The 
substrate is a 7°7 cm2 polyimide film with 200 µm thickness. 
The substrate is cleaned by ethanol and dried in nitrogen before 
the device fabrication process. A 10 nm thick chromium layer is 
deposited by electron beam evaporation onto the substrate to 
serve as the adhesion layer between the substrate and bottom 
electrode. Then a 100 nm thick gold layer is deposited by 
electron beam evaporation onto the chromium layer to serve as 
the bottom electrode. Then the bottom electrode is patterned by 
photolithography and wet etching.

The PZT film is deposited by the aerosol deposition 
method. The entire deposition process is operated at room 
temperature. The aerosol deposition method is to accelerate the 
PZT aerosol flow that is formed by mixing the PZT powder 
with the carrier gas, to impact on the substrate with high speed 
so that the PZT film can be produced due to particle 
densification. The deposition mechanism and equipment 
configuration are detailed in the author’s published work [6]. 
To accelerate the PZT particles, a differential pressure between 
the deposition chamber and the powder chamber is applied. The 
suitable range of the differential pressure is within 13kPa and 
40 kPa [6]. We use HCQ-type PZT powder (hard doped PZT) 
which is prepared by ELECERAM TECHNOLOGY Co. The 
average size of the HCQ particles is about 500 nm in diameter. 
Nitrogen is used as carrier gas. The volume concentration of the 
PZT powder in the carrier gas stream is 1.1x10-5. The 
deposition rate is controlled by the moving speed of the X-Y 
stage and the carrier gas flow rate. The velocity of the X-Y 
stage is 11 mm/sec. The deposition rates are 36 nm/min and 44 
nm/min under the nitrogen flow rates of 5 L/min and 6 L/min 
respectively. The resulted PZT film is about 2 µm thick with the 
roughness about 80 nm. The deposited PZT film already has 
perovskite phase.  
The metallization of top electrode is similar to the bottom 
electrode except that the top electrode is patterned by lift-off 
method. Four types of the top electrode are developed; those are 
the crisscross type, the web type, the target type, and the 
rectangle type, as shown in Fig. 2. Finally, the PZT film is 
etched by hydrochloric acid solution to open the boding pad of 
the bottom electrode. Fig. 3 shows the finished flexible PZT 
pyroelectric sensor.
