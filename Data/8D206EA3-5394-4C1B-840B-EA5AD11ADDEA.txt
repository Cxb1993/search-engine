ABSTRACT 
The newly anthrylamine-based aromatic dicarboxylic acid, 
9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene, was successfully synthesized by the 
sodium hydride-mediated condensation of 9-aminoanthracene with 
4-fluorobenzonitrile, followed by the alkaline hydrolysis of the dinitrile intermediate 
led to a newly anthrylamine-based aromatic dicarboxylic acid. 
N-(4-Aminophenyl)phenothiazine was prepared by the cesium fluoride-mediated 
aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction of phenothiazine with 
4-fluoronitrobenzene followed by hydrazine Pd/C-catalytic reduction. Further 
amination reaction between N-(4-aminophenyl)phenothiazine with 
4-fluoronitrobenzene, subsequent reduction of the dinitro intermediate obtained to 
the new phenothiazine-containing aromatic diamine, 
4,4’-diamino-4”-N-phenothiazinyltriphenylamine.  
This study has been separated into three parts. Part I and II include two series of 
novel aromatic poly(amine-amide)s and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s based on 
9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene. Part III included a series of novel 
aromatic poly(amine-amide)s based on 
4,4’-diamino-4”-N-phenothiazinyltriphenylamine. The synthesis, basic 
characterization, photoluminescence, electrochemical and electrochromic properties 
of three series of novel aromatic polymers bearing pendent anthrylamine and 
phenothiazine groups were investigated and compared, respectively. All polymers 
had good solubility in many polar aprotic solvents, and exhibited excellent 
thin-film-forming ability. In additional to high Tg or Ts values, good thermal stability, 
and lower HOMO energy levels, some of polymers also exhibited good 
photoluminescent and excellent reversibility of electrochromic characteristics. Thus, 
these novel anthrylamine-containing polymers can be considered not only as

ABSTRACT 
A new anthrylamine-derived aromatic dicarboxylic acid, 
9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4), was successfully synthesized by 
the sodium hydride-mediated condensation of 9-aminoanthracene with 
4-fluorobenzonitrile, followed by the alkaline hydrolysis of the intermediate dicyano 
compound 1. A series of novel polyamides with pendent anthrylamine units having 
inherent viscosities of 0.18-0.51 dL/g were prepared via the direct phosphorylation 
polycondensation from various diamines and the anthrylamine-based aromatic 
dicarboxylic acid 4. All the polyamides were readily soluble in NMP, DMAc, DMF, 
DMSO and could be cast into transparent films with weight-average molecular 
weights (Mw) and degree of polymerization (DP) in the range of 34100-43500 
daltons and 24.0-40.4, respectively. The aromatic polyamides had useful levels of 
thermal stability associated with relatively high softening temperatures (Ts) (288-302 
oC), 10 % weight-loss temperatures (Td10) nearly in excess of 550 oC, and char yields 
at 800 oC in nitrogen higher than 60 %. These polymers exhibited maximum UV-vis 
absorption at 348-360 nm in NMP solution. Their photoluminescence in NMP 
solution exhibited fluorescence emission maxima around 487-492 nm for the 
aromatic polyamides I. The photoluminescence quantum yield in NMP solution 
ranges from 55.2 % for Ia to 73.9 % for Ie. The hole-transporting properties were 
examined by electrochemical methods. Cyclic voltammograms of the polyamide 
films cast onto an indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate exhibited one 
oxidation and reduction couples (Eonset) around 1.08-1.17 and -1.51-(-1.54) V versus 
Ag/AgCl in acetonitrile (CH3CN) and DMF solutions, respectively.

effects. For example, the introduction of an asymmetric meta-linkage in the main 
conjugated chain of the polymer can limit interchain interaction as well as constrain 
exciton migration to the quenching site.10,11 The greater the torsion angle, the more 
interrupted the effective conjugated length or reduced interchain interaction. Another 
approach is to use bulky substituents to limit close packing between aromatic 
chromophores in the solid state.12 
  Wholly aromatic polyamides are characterized as highly thermally stable 
polymers with a favorable balance of physical and chemical properties. However, 
the rigidity of the backbone and strong hydrogen bonding result in high melting 
temperatures or glass-transition temperatures and limited solubility in most organic 
solvents.13,14 These properties make them generally intractable or difficult to process, 
thus restricting their applications in some fields. To overcome these limitations, 
polymer-structure modification becomes necessary. One of the common approaches 
for increasing the solubility and processability of polyamides without sacrificing 
high thermal stability is the introduction of bulky, packing-disruptive groups into the 
polymer backbone.15-22 Recently, we have reported the synthesis of soluble aromatic 
poly(amine-amide)s bearing triarylamine units in the main chain.23-26 Because of the 
incorporation of bulky, propeller-shaped triphenylamine units along the polymer 
backbone, all the polymers were amorphous, showed good solubility in many 
aprotic solvents, good film-forming capability, and exhibited high thermal stability.  
Therefore, we synthesized the newly anthrylamine-based diacid monomer, 
9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4). The incorporation of bulky 
9-anthryldiphenylamine moieties would interrupt the intermolecular hydrogen 
bonding of the polyamides and generally disturb the coplanarity of the aromatic unit 
to reduce stacking efficiency and crystallinity. The general properties such as 
solubility, and thermal properties are reported. The electrochemical, electrochromic,

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 
2.1. Materials 
1-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]naphthalene27 (mp: 316-318 oC) and 
4,4’-dicarboxytriphenylamine28 (mp: 313-315 oC) were synthesized by the cesium 
fluoride-mediated condensation of 1-naphthylamine and aniline with 
4-fluorobenzonitrile, followed by the alkaline hydrolysis of the intermediate dinitrile 
compound according to a previously reported procedure, respectively. Commercially 
available aromatic diamines such as p-phenylenediamine (5a) (TCI) and 
9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorene (5c) (TCI) were purified by sublimation in vacuo and 
recrystallized in ethanal, respectively. 4,4’-Oxydianiline (5b) (TCI) were used as 
received. 2,2’-Bis(4-aminophenoxy)-1,1’-binaphthyl (5d) and 
2,2’-bis(4-amino-2-trifluoromethylphenoxy)biphenyl (5e)  were synthesized 
previously in our laboratory.29 Commercially obtained anhydrous calcium chloride 
(CaCl2) was dried under vacuum at 180 oC for 8 h. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate 
(TBAP) (Acros) was recrystallized twice by ethyl acetate under nitrogen atmosphere 
and then dried in vacuo prior to use. All other reagents were used as received from 
commercial sources.

In a 500-mL three-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar under 
nitrogen atmosphere, 9.14 g (50.23 mmole) of anthracene is suspended in 80 ml of 
glacial acetic acid. The flask is immersed in a water bath at 20–25 oC, and 3.49 g 
(55.40 mole) of concentrated nitric acid (100 %) is added slowly from the dropping 
funnel with vigorous stirring. The rate of addition is controlled so that the reaction 
8 
Pd/C were dissolved/suspended in 260 mL of ethanol. The suspension solution was 
heated to reflux, and 3 mL of hydrazine monohydrate was added slowly to the mixture, 
then the solution was stirred at reflux temperature. After a further 12 h of reflux, the 
solution was filtered to remove Pd/C, and the filtrate was cooled to precipitate yellow 
crystals. The product was collected by filtration and dried in vacuo at 80 oC to give 
9.49 g (91 % in yield) of yellow crystals with a mp of 163-165 oC (lit.31 120-123 oC).

2.3. Polymer Synthesis 
Direct Polycondensation via the Phosphorylation Reaction 
The synthesis of polyamide Ib was used as an example to illustrate the general 
synthetic route used to produce the poly(amine-amide)s. A mixture of 0.217 g (0.5 
mmol) of dicarboxylic acid, 9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4), 
0.100 g (0.5 mmol) of 4,4’-oxydianiline (5b), 0.06 g of calcium chloride, 0.5 mL of 
triphenyl phosphite, 0.25 mL of pyridine, and 0.5 mL of NMP was heated with 
stirring at 105 oC for 3 h. The obtained polymer solution was poured slowly into 300 
mL of stirred methanol giving rise to a stringy, fiber-like precipitate that was 
collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with hot water and methanol, and dried 
under vacuum at 100 oC. Precipitations from DMAc into methanol were carried out 
twice for further purification. The inherent viscosity and weight-average molecular 
weights (Mw) of the obtained polyamide Ib was 0.44 dL/g (measured at a 
concentration of 0.5 g/dL in DMAc at 30 oC) and 42400 daltons, respectively. 1H

determined through gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 50 oC using a Waters 
510 HPLC, equipped with a 410 differential refractometer, a refractive index (RI) 
detector, and an UV detector. Three Ultrastyragel columns (100, 500, and 103) were 
connected in series in order of increasing pore size, with DMF as eluent at a flow rate 
of 0.6 mL/min. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements were performed 
at room temperature (ca. 25 oC) on a Shimadzu XRD-7000 X-ray diffractometer (40 
kV, 20 mA), using graphite-monochromatized Cu-Kα radiation. The molecular weight 
calibration curve was obtained using polystyrene standards. Thermogravimetric 
analysis (TGA) was conducted with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were 
carried out on approximately 6-8 mg film samples heated in flowing nitrogen or air 
(flow rate: 20 cm3/min) at a heating rate of 20 oC/min. Thermomechanical analysis 
(TMA) was conducted with a PerkinElmer Diamond TMA instrument. The TMA 
experiments were conducted from 50 to 350 oC at a scan rate of 10 oC/min with a 
penetration probe 1.0 mm in diameter under an applied constant load of 50 mN. 
Softening temperatures (Ts) were taken as the onset temperatures of probe 
displacement on the TMA traces. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the polymer 
films were recorded on a Varian Cary 50 Probe spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) 
spectra were measured with a Jasco FP-6300 spectrofluorometer. PL quantum yields 
(ΦPL) of the samples in different solvents were measured by using quinine sulfate 
dissolved in 1 N sulfuric acid as a reference standard (ΦPL = 0.546).32 All spectra were 
obtained by averaging five scans. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with a 
Bioanalytical System Model CV-27 potentiostat and a BAS X–Y recorder with ITO 
(polymer films area about 0.7 cm × 0.5 cm) was used as a working electrode and a 
platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode at a scan rate of 50 and 100 mV/s against a 
Ag/AgCl reference electrode in dry acetonitrile (CH3CN) and 
N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate

CHAPTER 3 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1. Monomer Synthesis 
As a starting material, anthracene, three intermediate aromatic compounds were 
synthesized and the synthetic routines are outlined in Scheme 1.1. 9-Nitroanthracene 
(1) was synthesized by the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction between 
anthracene and nitric acid. The 9-aminoanthracene (2) could be obtained by 
Pd/C-catalytic reduction of compound 1 with hydrazine monohydrate under a nitrogen 
atmosphere. The new aromatic dicarboxylic acid having bulky pendent anthrylamine 
group, 9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4), was successfully 
synthesized by the double N-arylation reaction of 9-aminoanthracene with 
4-fluorobenzonitrile in DMF in the presence of sodium hydride as a base, followed by 
the alkaline hydrolysis of the intermediate dinitrile compound (3). Elemental analysis, 
IR, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic techniques were used to identify structures of 
the intermediate compound 1, 2, dinitrile compound 3, and dicarboxylic acid 
monomer 4. Figure 1.1 and 1.2 shows the FT-IR spectra of all the synthesized 
compounds. The nitrile groups of compounds 3 gave characteristic bands at 2223 cm-1 
(C≡N stretching). After hydrolysis, the characteristic absorptions of the diacid showed 
the typical C=O and O-H stretching absorptions at 1676 and 2700-3200 cm-1, 
respectively. Figures 1.3 to 1.6 illustrate the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of 
intermediate compound 1, 2, dinitrile compound 3, and dicarboxylic acid monomer 4. 
Assignments of each carbon and proton are assisted by the two-dimensional NMR 
spectra shown in Figures 1.7 and 1.8, and these spectra agree well with the proposed 
molecular structure of dicarboxylic acid monomer 4.

3.2. Polymer Synthesis 
According to the phosphorylation technique first described by Yamazaki and 
coworkers33,34, a series of novel polyamides (I) with pendent anthrylamine units 
were synthesized from the dicarboxylic acid, 
9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4), and various aromatic diamines (5) 
as shown in Scheme 1.2. The polymerization was carried out via solution 
polycondensation using triphenyl phosphite and pyridine as condensing agents. The 
polymerization proceeded homogeneously throughout the reaction and afforded 
clear, viscous polymer solutions. All the polymers precipitated in a tough fiber-like 
form when slowly pouring the resulting polymer solutions into methanol. The 
obtained polyamides had inherent viscosities in the range of 0.18-0.51 dL/g with 
weight-average molecular weights (Mw) and degree of polymerization (DP) in the 
range of 34100-43500 daltons and 24.0-40.4, respectively, relative to polystyrene 
standards (Table 1.1).  
For obtaining the light-colored polyamides, the lower capability of charge transfer 
are indispensable. The formation of the polyamides was confirmed with IR and 
NMR spectroscopy. Figure 1.9 shows a typical IR spectrum for polyamide Ib. They 
exhibited characteristic IR absorption bands of the amide group around 3408 (N-H 
stretching), 1655 cm-1 (amide carbonyl). The structure of polyamide Ib was also 
confirmed by solution NMR. Figure 1.10 shows a typical set of 1H and 13C NMR 
spectra of polyamide Ib in DMSO-d6, where all the peaks could be readily assigned 
to the hydrogen and carbon atoms of the recurring unit. Assignments of each carbon 
and proton are assisted by the two-dimensional H-H COSY (Correlation 
Spectroscopy) and C-H HMQC (Heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Correlation) 
spectra shown in Figure 1.11 and 1.12, respectively, and these spectra agree well 
with the proposed molecular structure of polyamide Ib.

3.3.3. Optical Properties 
The optical properties of the polyamides were investigated by UV-vis and 
photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results are summarized in Table 1.4. These 
polymers exhibited maximum UV-vis absorption at 348-360 nm in NMP solutions, 
due to the π-π* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, e.g., anthracene units and 
phenyl rings. In solid state, the UV-vis absorption of anthrylamine-based polyamides 
I are nearly identical and show a single absorbance at 349-359 nm. Figure 1.15 shows 
UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of polyamides measured in NMP (Conc.: 10-6 
mol/L). The quantum yields of these polymers after refractive index correction can be 
calculated according to eq 1:35

of the solutions. The aromatic polyamides I series exhibited PL emission maxima 
around 487-492 nm in NMP solution. The PL quantum yield in NMP solution ranges 
from 55.2 % for Ia to 73.9 % for Ie. The PL of the some polymer solutions and thin 
films I by UV irradiation was also shown in Figure 1.16. The transmission UV-vis 
spectra of polyamide films are shown in Figure 1.17. The cutoff wavelengths 
(absorption edge; λ0) from the UV-vis transmittance spectra showed light-color and 
high optical transparency with cutoff wavelength in the range of 423-433 nm.

3.3.4. Solvatochromism 
The absorption and PL spectra of the solutions of polyamide Ie in various solvents 
with its thin film was shown in Figure 1.18. The absorption spectra of the four 
different solvents were very similar to each other. The PL spectrum of Ie 
progressively shifts to red with an increase in the solvent polarity, with PL emission 
maxima moving from 469 to 487 nm when the solvent is changed from toluene to 
NMP (Figure 1.19 and Table 1.5), which was probably due to dipole-dipole 
interactions of the excited state of the polymer with different solvent.36 Even more, 
the PL emission of polymer Ie in NMP was red-shifted compared to that of its thin 
solid film. The emission color changes from bluish green in toluene to green in NMP 
when the polymer solutions were illuminated under a 365 nm UV lamp (Figure 1.20), 
which well coincide with their PL spectra. The quantum efficiency of polymer Ie 
generally decreases with the decreasing polarity of solvent (Table 1.5). This 
phenomenon was also previously reported in our laboratory.37 The solvatochromism is 
caused by photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the excited state. 
Such chromic behavior is associated with the stabilization of the polar emissive 
excited states by the polar solvents.38 The solvatochromic shifts of the emission 
spectra are much larger than those of absorption spectra, implying that the 
excited-state energy levels are influenced more than those in the electronic ground 
state.39

CHAPTER 4 
CONCLUSIONS 
The newly triarylamine-containing aromatic dicarboxylic acid, 
9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4) was successfully synthesized in 
high purity and good yields. Novel polyamides have been readily prepared from the 
dicarboxylic acid, and various aromatic diamines via the direct phosphorylation 
polycondensation. The introduction of the bulky anthracene group into the polymer 
backbone disrupt the copolanarity of aromatic units in chain packing which increases 
the between-chains spaces or free volume thus enhancing solubility and thermal 
stability of the formed polyamides. All the amorphous polymers exhibited high 
optical transparency from UV-vis transmittance measurement with cutoff wavelength 
in the range of 423-433 nm, and exhibited green emission maximum around 478-484 
nm in solid state. These polyamides exhibited highly photoluminescence quantum 
yield in NMP solution ranges from 55.2 % for Ia to 73.9 % for Ie due to the 
introduction of anthrylamine chromophores. Owing to their relatively high quantum 
efficiency in solution, thus, these novel anthrylamine-based polyamides can be 
considered not only as new candidates for organo-processable high-performance 
polymeric materials in flat panel displays (FPDs) but also could be widely applied in 
P-LED as a new type green-light-emitting materials.

ABSTRACT 
Six poly(amine-hydrazide)s were prepared from the polycondensation reactions of 
the dicarboxylic acid 9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4), 
1-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]naphthalene (4’), and 
4,4’-dicarboxytriphenylamine (4’’) with terephthalic dihydrazide (TPH) and 
isophthalic dihydrazide (IPH) via the Yamazaki phosphorylation reaction, 
respectively. The poly(amine-hydrazide)s were readily soluble in many common 
organic solvents and could be solution cast into transparent and flexible films with 
good mechanical properties. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that 
these hydrazide polymers had glass-transition temperatures (Tg) in the range of 
182-230 oC and could be thermally cyclodehydrated into the corresponding 
oxadiazole polymers in the range of 300-400 oC. The resulting 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s had useful levels of thermal stability associated with 
high Tg (263-318 oC), 10 % weight-loss temperatures in excess of 500 oC, and char 
yield at 800 oC in nitrogen higher than 55 %. These organo-soluble 
anthrylamine-based poly(amine-hydrazide)s and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s 
exhibited maximum UV-vis absorption at 346-349 and 379-388 nm in NMP solution, 
respectively. Their photoluminescence spectra in NMP solution showed maximum 
bands around 490-497 nm in the green region. The poly(amine-hydrazide) I-IPH 
derived from diacid 4 and IPH showed a green photoluminescence at 490 nm and 
exhibited a 30 % quantum yield in NMP solution. The hole- and electron- transporting 
and electrochromic properties were examined by electrochemical and 
spectroelectrochemical methods. The anthrylamine-based 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s revealed a electrochromic characteristics with 
changing color from the pale yellow neutral form to the red reduced form when 
scanning potentials negatively from 0.00 to -2.20 V.

formation.9-10 There are some effective approaches to minimize these undesirable 
effects. For example, the isolated copoly(aryl ether)s consisting of defined 
hole-transporting (donor) or electron-transporting (acceptor) segments did enhanced 
electron and hole affinities simultaneously, among which the nonconjugated spacers 
conduced toward large band gap for blue emission.11-13 The introduction of an 
asymmetric meta-linkage in the main conjugated chain of the polymer also can limit 
interchain interaction as well as constrain exciton migration to quenching site.14-15 The 
greater the torsion angle, the more interrupted the effective conjugated length or 
reduced interchain interaction. Another approach is to use bulky substituents to limit 
close packing between aromatic chromophores in the solid state.16 In all these devices, 
for achieving efficient performance, tedious and complex multilayer structures were 
needed to offset the poor hole injection or electron affinity of the blue light emitting 
polymers. Therefore, it is desirable to design and synthesize a bipolar polymer that 
possesses both a hole-transporting segment and an electron-affinitive moiety to 
balance the rates of injection of holes and electrons.17-18 
Oxadiazole derivatives are often associated with blue luminescent polymers as an 
electron transporting molecules either in the same layer or in a bilayer. Triarylamines 
also have attracted considerable interest as hole transport materials for use in 
multilayer organic electroluminescence (EL) devices due to their relatively high 
mobility and their low ionization potentials.19-22 The feasibility of utilizing 
spin-coating and ink-jet printing processes for large-area EL devices and possibilities 
of various chemical modifications (to improve emission efficiencies and allow 
patterning) make polymeric materials containing triarylamine units very attractive.23-29 
To enhance the hole injection ability of polymeric emissive materials such as 
poly(1,4-phenylenevinylene)s (PPV) and polyfluorenes (PF), there have been several 
reports on PPV and PF derivatives involving hole-transporting units such as

compared with those of structurally related ones from 
1-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]naphthalene and 4,4’-dicarboxytriphenylamine.

filtration, washed thoroughly with hot water and methanol. Precipitations from DMAc 
into methanol were carried out twice for further purification. The yield as quantitative, 
and the inherent viscosity and weight-average molecular weights (Mw) of the obtained 
polyamide I-TPH was 0.39 dL/g (measured at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL in DMAc 
at 30 oC) and 23100 daltons, respectively. IR (film): 3271 (N-H), 1657 cm-1 (amide 
carbonyl). The other poly(amine-hydrazide)s were prepared by an analogous 
procedure.  
 
2.3. Film Preparation and Cyclodehydration of the Hydrazide Polymers  
A solution of polymer was made by dissolving about 0.3 g of the 
poly(amine-hydrazide) samples in 5 mL of DMAc, and the homogeneous solution 
was poured into a 5-cm glass culture dish, which was heated at 50 oC for 1 h, 100 oC 
for 2 h, and 160 oC for 5 h to slowly release the solvent under vacuum. The obtained 
film with the thickness of 30-40 μm was used for X-ray diffraction measurements, 
solubility tests, thermal analyses, optical and electrochemical properties and 
electrochromic characteristics measurements. 
The cyclodehydration of the poly(amine-hydrazide)s to the corresponding 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s were carried out by successive heating the above 
fabricated polymer films at 200 oC for 30 min, 300 oC for 1 h, and then 350 oC for 3 h 
under vacuum. Anal. Calcd of IV-TPH for (C36H21N5O2)n (555.58)n: C, 77.83 %; H, 
3.81 %; N, 12.61 %. Found: C, 75.92 %; H, 3.95 %; N, 13.01 %. 
 
2.4. Measurements 
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer RXI 
FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental analyses were run in a VarioEL-III Elementar. 1H and 
13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were measured on a Bruker AV-300 
146 
at a scan rate of 50 and 200 mV/s against a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in dry 
acetonitrile (CH3CN) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of 0.1 M 
tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) under nitrogen atmosphere for oxidation 
and reduction measurements, respectively. Voltammograms are presented with the 
positive/negative potential pointing to the right/left with increasing anodic/decreasing 
cathodic current pointing upwards/downwards. The spectroelectrochemical cell was 
composed of a 1 cm cuvette, ITO as a working electrode, a platinum wire as an 
auxiliary electrode, and a home-made Ag/AgCl, KCl (sat.) reference electrode.

3.2. Polymer properties 
3.2.1. Basic Characterization 
The solubility behavior of all the polymers and the appearance of the cast films are 
shown in Table 2.2. These low-colored polymers exhibited good solubility in various 
solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF, DMSO and m-cresol. Compared with phenyl- 
and naphthyl-based poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s series, the enhanced solubility of 
anthryl-based IV series can be attributed to the introduction of bulky, asymmetry and 
noncoplanar 9-anthryldiphenylamine group into the repeat unit, which interrupt chain 
packing and decrease interchain interactions. Thus, the excellent solubility makes 
these polymers as potential candidates for practical applications by spin-coating or 
ink-jet printing processes. 
The wide-angle X-ray diffraction studies of the poly(amine-hydrazide)s and 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s indicated that all the polymers were essentially 
amorphous. The amorphous nature can be attributed to the introduction of bulky, 
twisted, three-dimensional 9-anthryldiphenylamine unit along the polymer backbone. 
 
154 
3.2.2. Thermal Properties 
The thermal properties of poly(amine-hydrazide)s and 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s are summarized in Table 2.3. The glass-transition 
temperatures (Tg) of poly(amine-hydrazide)s and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s were 
observed in the range of 200-221 and 297-318 oC by DSC. Typical TGA curves for 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) IV-TPH are reproduced in Figure 2.3. All of the 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s exhibited a similar TGA pattern with no significant 
weight loss below 500 oC in air or nitrogen atmosphere. The 10 % weight-loss 
temperatures (Td10) of the poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s in nitrogen and air were 
recorded in the range of 515-520 oC and 510-520 oC, respectively. The amount of 
carbonized residue (char yield) of these polymers was more than 55 % at 800 oC in 
nitrogen. The high char yields of these polymers can be ascribed to their high 
aromatic content. As shown in Table 2.3, when compared with phenyl- and 
naphthyl-based poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s, the anthryl-based IV series showed a 
higher Tg and better thermal stability due to the introduction of pendent anthracene 
groups in the repeat unit.

3.2.5. Electrochromic Characteristics 
Electrochromism of these poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s thin films was examined 
by an optically transparent thin-layer electrode (OTTLE) coupled with UV-vis 
spectroscopy. The electrode preparations and solution conditions were identical to 
those used in CV. The typical electrochromic absorption spectra of 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) IV-IPH are shown in Figures 2.8 and 2.9. When the 
applied potentials decreased negatively from 0.00 to -2.20 V, the peak of 
characteristic absorbance at 376 nm for poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) IV-IPH 
decreased gradually while one new bands grew up at 511 nm due to the electron 
reduction. The new spectrum was assigned as that of the anionic radical 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) － ․  was generated and exhibited strong bands as 
determined by UV-vis spectroelectrochemical methods. Meanwhile, color of the film 
changed from original pale yellow to a red reduced form. Polymer IV-IPH exhibited 
highly contrast of optical transmittance change (Δ T %) up to 65 % in 511 nm. The 
coloration efficiency at 511 nm is as high as ca. 122 cm2/C with high optical density 
change (δOD511) up to 0.52, determined from the in situ experiments.55

by steric factors may hinder close packing and
improve the device performance; hence the an-
thracene derivatives have been extensively stud-
ied in applications such as LEDs.7
An emitter with either a hole- or electron-
transporting capability is beneﬁcial, thus can sim-
plify the device structure. Most of the hole-trans-
porting materials which contain amine functional-
ities lack sufﬁcient emission characteristics due to
reductive quenching.8 On the other hand, strong
or bright luminescent materials may be obtained
by incorporating chromophore units to the amine
derivatives. Research by our laboratory9 and
others10 aimed at the development of triaryl-
amines incorporated with photoluminescent chro-
mophores has resulted in a new class of com-
pounds capable of emitting blue or green colors.
Triarylamines capable of emitting blue light
appear to be interesting because they can not only
be used as a blue-light source, but also as host for
downhill energy transfer to green- or red-emitting
materials. Triarylamines also have attracted con-
siderable interest as hole transport materials for
use in multilayer organic electroluminescence
(EL) devices due to their relatively high mobility
and their low ionization potentials.11 The feasibil-
ity of utilizing spin-coating and inkjet printing
processes for large-area EL devices and the possi-
bilities for various chemical modiﬁcations (to
improve emission efﬁciencies and allow pattern-
ing) make polymeric materials containing triaryl-
amine units very attractive.12
Wholly aromatic polyamides are characterized
as highly thermally stable polymers with a favor-
able balance of physical and chemical properties.
However, the rigidity of the backbone and strong
hydrogen bonding result in high melting tempera-
tures or glass-transition temperatures and limited
solubility in most organic solvents.13 These proper-
ties make them generally intractable or difﬁcult to
process, thus restricting their applications in some
ﬁelds. To overcome these limitations, polymer-
structure modiﬁcation becomes necessary. One of
the common approaches for increasing the solubil-
ity and processability of aromatic polymers with-
out sacriﬁcing high thermal stability is the
introduction of bulky, packing-disruptive groups
into the polymer backbone.14 Recently, we have
reported the synthesis of soluble aromatic poly
(amine-amide)s bearing naphthylamine9(d) and
carbazole9(b) chromophores in the main chain with
high quantum yield of 15 and 46% in N-methyl-2-
pyrrolidone (NMP), respectively. Because of the
introduction of bulky, propeller-shaped triphenyl-
amine units along the polymer backbone, all the
polymers were amorphous with good solubility in
many aprotic solvents and ﬁlm-forming capability,
and exhibited high thermal stability.15
In this contribution, we describe the synthesis
of novel anthrylamine-based diacid monomer, 9-
[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4),
and the corresponding aromatic polyamides. The
incorporation of bulky, hindered rotation, and
kinked 9-anthryldiphenylamine moieties into
polymer backbone could enhance the solubility by
reducing interchain interactions and stacking efﬁ-
ciency with retention of excellent thermal stabil-
ity. The general properties such as solubility and
thermal properties are described. Furthermore,
the photophysical, electrochemical, and photo-
luminescent properties of these polyamides were
also investigated and are compared with those of
structurally related ones from 1-[N,N-di(4-carboxy-
phenyl)amino]naphthalene and 4,40-dicarboxy-
triphenylamine.

(mp: 316-318 C) and 4,40-dicarboxytriphenyl-

thylamine and aniline with 4-ﬂuorobenzonitrile,
followed by the alkaline hydrolysis of the interme-
diate dinitrile compound according to a previously
reported procedure, respectively. Commercially

triﬂuoromethylphenoxy)biphenyl (5e) were syn-
thesized previously in our laboratory.17 Anhydrous
calcium chloride (CaCl2) was dried under vacuum
at 180 C for 8 h. Tetrabutylammonium perchlo-
rate (TBAP) (Acros) was recrystallized twice by
ethyl acetate under nitrogen atmosphere and then
dried in vacuo prior to use. All other reagents were
used as received from commercial sources.

Polymer Synthesis
The synthesis of polyamide Ib was used as an
example to illustrate the general synthetic route
used to produce the poly(amine-amide)s. A mix-
ture of 0.217 g (0.5 mmol) of dicarboxylic acid, 9-
[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene (4),
0.100 g (0.5 mmol) of 4,40-oxydianiline (5b), 0.06 g
of calcium chloride, 0.5 mL of triphenyl phosphite,
0.25 mL of pyridine, and 0.5 mL of NMP was
heated with stirring at 105 C for 3 h. The
obtained polymer solution was poured slowly into
300 mL of stirred methanol giving rise to a
stringy, ﬁber-like precipitate that was collected by
ﬁltration, washed thoroughly with hot water and
methanol, and dried under vacuum at 100 C.
Precipitations from DMAc into methanol were
carried out twice for further puriﬁcation. The
inherent viscosity and weight-average molecular
weights (Mw) of the obtained polyamide Ib was
0.44 dL/g (measured at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL
in DMAc at 30 C) and 42,400 Da, respectively. 1H

The other polyamides were prepared by an analo-
gous procedure.
Preparation of the Polyamide Films
A solution of polymer was made by dissolving
about 0.35 g of the polyamides sample in 6 mL of
DMAc. The homogeneous solution was poured
into a 5-cm glass Petri dish, which was heated at
40 C for 4 h, 100 C for 2 h, and 160 C for 6 h to
slowly release the solvent under vacuum. The
obtained ﬁlms were about 45–70 lm in thickness
and were used for X-ray diffraction measure-
ments, solubility tests, thermal analyses, optical
and electrochemical properties measurements.
Measurements
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were
recorded on a PerkinElmer RXI FTIR spectrome-
ter. Elemental analyses were run in a VarioEL-III
Elementar. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic reso-
nance (NMR) spectra were measured on a Bruker
AV-300 FT NMR system and referenced to the
DMSO-d6 signal, and peak multiplicity was
reported as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet;
m, multiplet. The inherent viscosities were deter-
mined at 0.5 g/dL concentration using Tamson
TV-2000 viscometer at 30 C. Molecular weight
and molecular weight distributions were deter-
mined through gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) at 50 C using a Waters 510 HPLC,
equipped with a 410 differential refractometer, a
refractive index (RI) detector, and an UV detector.
Three Ultrastyragel columns (100, 500, and 103)
were connected in series in order of increasing
pore size, with DMF as eluent at a ﬂow rate of 0.6
mL/min. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)
measurements were performed at room tempera-
ture ( 25 C) on a Shimadzu XRD-7000 X-ray
diffractometer (40 kV, 20 mA), using graphite-
monochromatized Cu-Ka radiation. The molecular
weight calibration curve was obtained using poly-
styrene standards. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was conducted with a PerkinElmer Pyris 1
TGA. Experiments were carried out on  6–8 mg

increased dramatically as the medium changing
from less polar (Toluene) to polar (NMP), and the
solvatochromic shifts of the emission spectra are
much larger than those of absorption spectra
implying that the excited-state energy levels are
inﬂuenced more than those in the electronic
ground state.23 The quantum efﬁciency of polymer

ABSTRACT: Two novel poly(amine-hydrazide)s were prepared from the polycondensa-
tion reactions of the dicarboxylic acid, 9-[N,N-di(4-carboxyphenyl)amino]anthracene
(1), with terephthalic dihydrazide (TPH) and isophthalic dihydrazide (IPH) via the
Yamazaki phosphorylation reaction, respectively. The poly(amine-hydrazide)s were
readily soluble in many common organic solvents and could be solution cast into
transparent ﬁlms. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that these hy-
drazide polymers had glass-transition temperatures (Tg) in the range of 182–230
C
and could be thermally cyclodehydrated into the corresponding oxadiazole polymers
in the range of 300–400 C. The resulting poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s had useful
levels of thermal stability associated with high Tg (263–318
C), 10% weight-loss
temperatures in excess of 500 C, and char yield at 800 C in nitrogen higher than
55%. These organo-soluble anthrylamine-based poly(amine-hydrazide)s and poly
(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s exhibited maximum UV-vis absorption at 346–349 and
379–388 nm in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution, respectively. Their photolu-
minescence spectra in NMP solution showed maximum bands around 490–497 nm in
the green region. The poly(amine-hydrazide) I-IPH showed a green photoluminescence
at 490 nm with PL quantum yield of 29.9% and 17.0% in NMP solution and ﬁlm state,
respectively. The anthrylamine-based poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s revealed a electro-
chromic characteristics with changing color from the pale yellow neutral form to the
red reduced form when scanning potentials negatively from 0.00 to 2.20 V. VC 2009

INTRODUCTION
Electrochromism is known as the reversible
change of the color resulting from the oxidation or
the reduction of the material by electrochemical
means. Color changes are commonly between a
transparent state, where the chromophore only
absorbs in the UV region, and a colored state or
between two colored states in a given electrolyte
solution. This interesting property led to the de-
velopment of many technological applications
such as automatic antiglazing mirror,1 smart win-
dows,2 electrochromic displays,3 and chameleon
materials.4
Triarylamine-containing polymers5 are not
only widely used as the electrochromic materials,6

IR (ﬁlm): 3271 (NAH), 1657 cm1 (amide car-
bonyl). The other poly(amine-hydrazide)s were
prepared by an analogous procedure.
Film Preparation and Cyclodehydration
of the Hydrazide Polymers
A solution of polymer was made by dissolving
about 0.3 g of the poly(amine-hydrazide) sample
in 5 mL of DMAc, and the homogeneous solution
was poured into a 5-cm glass culture dish, which
was heated at 50 C for 1 h, 100 C for 2 h, and
160 C for 5 h to slowly release the solvent under
vacuum. The obtained ﬁlm with the thickness of
30–40 lm was used for X-ray diffraction measure-
ments, solubility tests, thermal analyses, optical
and electrochemical properties, and electrochro-
mic characteristics measurements.
The cyclodehydration of the poly(amine-hydra-
zide)s to the corresponding poly(amine-1,3,4-oxa-
diazole)s were carried out by successive heating
the above fabricated polymer ﬁlms at 200 C for
30 min, 300 C for 1 h, and then 350 C for 3 h
under vacuum.

Measurements
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were
recorded on a PerkinElmer RXI FT-IR spectrome-
ter. Elemental analyses were run in a VarioEL-III
Elementar. The inherent viscosities were deter-
mined at 0.5 g/dL concentration using Tamson
TV-2000 viscometer at 30 C. Molecular weight
and molecular weight distributions were deter-
mined through gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) at 50 C using a Waters 510 HPLC,
equipped with a 410 differential refractometer, a
refractive index (RI) detector, and an UV detector.
Three Ultrastyragel columns (100, 500, and 103)
were connected in series in order of increasing
pore size, with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as
eluent at a ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The molecular
weight calibration curve was obtained using poly-
styrene standards. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) measurements were performed at room
temperature (25 C) on a Shimadzu XRD-7000
X-ray diffractometer (40 kV, 20 mA), using graph-
ite-monochromatized Cu-Ka radiation. Thermog-
ravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted with a
PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA. Experiments were car-
ried out on approximately 6–8 mg ﬁlm samples
heated in ﬂowing nitrogen or air (ﬂow rate: 20
cm3/min) at a heating rate of 20 C/min. DSC
analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer Pyris
Diamond DSC at a scan rate of 20 C/min in ﬂow-
ing nitrogen (ﬂow rate: 20 cm3/min). Ultraviolet-
visible (UV-vis) spectra of the polymer ﬁlms were
recorded on a Varian Cary 50 Probe spectrometer.
Absorption spectra in spectroelectochemical anal-
ysis were measured with a HP 8453 UV-visible
spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spec-
tra were measured with a Jasco FP-6300 spectro-
ﬂuorometer. PL quantum yields (UPL) of the
samples in NMP were measured by using quinine
sulfate dissolved in 1 N sulfuric acid as a refer-
ence standard (UPL ¼ 0.546).14 The photolumines-
cence quantum yields of polymer thin ﬁlms were
determined using a calibrated integrating sphere
coupled to a charge coupled device (CCD) spectro-
graph. The 325-nm line of the He-Cd laser was
used to excite samples placed in the calibrated
integrating sphere. All spectra were obtained by
averaging ﬁve scans. Differential pulse voltamme-
try (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measure-
ments were carried out with CH Instruments
(USA) controlled by an external personal com-
puter. ITO (polymer ﬁlms area about 0.7 cm  0.5
cm) was used as a working electrode and a plati-
num wire as an auxiliary electrode at a scan rate
of 50 and 200 mV/s against a Ag/AgCl reference
electrode in dry acetonitrile (CH3CN) and DMF
solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlo-
rate (TBAP) under nitrogen atmosphere for oxida-
tion and reduction measurements, respectively.
Voltammograms are presented with the positive/
negative potential pointing to the right/left with
increasing anodic/decreasing cathodic current
pointing upward/downward. The spectroelectro-
chemical cell was composed of a 1 cm cuvette, ITO
as a working electrode, a platinum wire as an
auxiliary electrode, and a home-made Ag/AgCl,
KCl (sat.) reference electrode.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Polymer Synthesis
A two-step procedure was employed to obtain the
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s from the dicarbox-
ylic acid monomers with TPH and IPH, respec-
tively, as shown in Scheme 1. The ﬁrst stage con-
sists of the synthesis of hydrazide prepolymers
which are converted to the corresponding oxadia-
zole polymers in the second stage by the thermal
cyclodehydration of the hydrazide group into the

daltons and 22.1–24.9, respectively, relative to
polystyrene standards (Supp. Info. Table S1).
Thermal conversion of the hydrazide group to
the 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring was conﬁrmed by ele-
mental analysis and IR spectroscopy. As a repre-
sentative study, a thin-ﬁlm of polyhydrazide I-
TPH was heated at 350 C for 3 h, and the IR
spectra are shown in Figure S1 in Supporting In-
formation. After curing at 350 C for 3 h, the com-
plete conversion from polyhydrazide I-TPH to
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) IV-TPH could be
conﬁrmed by the disappearance of the absorption
at 3271 (NAH), 1657 cm1 (amide carbonyl), and
the appearance of characteristic 1,3,4-oxadiazole
ring vibration at around 1488, 1602 (C¼N), and
1072 (CAOAC). DSC also could be used to investi-
gate the cyclization of hydrazide group to the oxa-
diazole structure. A typical pair of DSC curves of
poly(amine-hydrazide) I-TPH and poly(amine-
1,3,4-oxadiazole) IV-TPH are illustrated in Sup-
porting Information Figure S2. The main endo-
thermic peak revealed the cyclodehydration reac-
tion of hydrazide group with water evolution in
the range of 300–400 C. The obtained poly-
(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s had inherent viscosities
in the range of 0.35–0.39 dL/g.
Polymer Properties
Basic Characterizations
The solubility behavior of all the polymers is
shown in Supporting Information Table S2. These
polymers with light-color exhibited good solubility
in various solvents such as NMP, DMAc, DMF,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and m-cresol. Com-
pared with phenyl- and naphthyl-based poly
(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s series, the enhanced
solubility of anthryl-based IV series can be attrib-
uted to the introduction of bulky, asymmetry and
noncoplanar 9-anthryldiphenylamine group into
the repeat unit, which interrupt chain packing
and decrease interchain interactions. Thus, the
excellent solubility makes these polymers as
potential candidates for practical applications by
spin-coating or ink-jet printing processes.
The wide-angle X-ray diffraction studies of the
poly(amine-hydrazide)s and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxa-
diazole)s indicated that all the polymers were
essentially amorphous. The amorphous nature
can be attributed to the introduction of bulky,
twisted, three-dimensional 9-anthryldiphenyl-
amine unit along the polymer backbone.
The thermal properties of poly(amine-hydrazide)s
and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s are summarized

(Supp. Info. Fig. S4).
The electrochemical properties of the poly
(amine-hydrazide)s and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadia-
zole)s were investigated by CV and DPV. The
results are summarized in Table 3. The redox
behavior of these polymers was investigated by
CV conducted for the cast ﬁlms on an ITO-coated
glass substrate as working electrode in dry
CH3CN and DMF containing 0.1 M of TBAP as an
electrolyte under nitrogen atmosphere for oxida-
tion and reduction measurements. Figure 3 shows
the typical CV for poly(amine-hydrazide) I-TPH
and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) IV-TPH. Figure

the anthrylamine-based polymer ﬁlms. It shows
clearly that there is an overlap of peak potential
for IV-TPH. Comparing with I-TPH, the second
reduction behavior of IV-TPH might occur on the
anthracene group. Therefore, the ﬁrst and third
reduction behaviors of IV-TPH were assumed to
occur on the oxadiazole moieties. In addition, the
ﬁrst and second reduction stage of IV-IPH could
be assigned to the anthracene and oxadiazole
units, respectively. The mechanism for the elec-
trochemical reduction of poly(amine-hydrazide)s
and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s could be
depicted as in Schemes 2 and 3, respectively.15 In
addition, the oxidation potentials of poly(amine-
hydrazide)s were almost the same as the corre-
sponding poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s that also
could explain these polymers with donor acceptor
moieties are isolated system. The energy of the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) lev-
els of the corresponding polymers can be deter-
mined from the oxidation onset, reduction onset
potentials (Eonset) and the onset absorption wave-
length,12 and the results were listed in Table 3.
For example, the oxidation/reduction onset for
poly(amine-hydrazide) I-TPH has been deter-
mined as 1.07/1.46 (V versus Ag/AgCl). The
external ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fcþ) redox
standard E1/2 is 0.44 V versus Ag/AgCl in CH3CN.
Assuming that the HOMO energy for the Fc/Fcþ
standard is 4.80 eV with respect to the zero vac-
uum level, the HOMO and LUMO energies for

CONCLUSIONS
A series of aromatic poly(amine-hydrazide)s were
prepared from the dicarboxylic acid with tereph-
thalic dihydrazide (TPH) and isophthalic dihy-
drazide (IPH), respectively, via the Yamazaki
phosphorylation reaction, and were thermally
cyclodehydrated into the corresponding poly
(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s. The introduction of the
bulky anthracene group into the polymer back-
bone disrupt the coplanarity of aromatic units in
chain packing which increases the between-
chains spaces or free volume thus enhancing solu-
bility and thermal stability of the formed poly
(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s. All the amorphous
polymers exhibited high optical transparency
from UV-vis transmittance measurement with
cutoff wavelength in the range of 415–435 nm.
The poly(amine-hydrazide) I-IPH and poly
(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) IV-IPH exhibited green
ﬂuorescence emission maximum at 490 nm in
