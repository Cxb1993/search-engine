Keywords: Spherical inverted pendulum; 
Omnidirectional mobile robot； Nonlinear 
control systems; Sliding mode control. 
 
1.  Motivation and Objective 
The inverted pendulum model resembles 
many simplified systems that arise in robotic 
and aerospace applications. The control of an 
inverted pendulum is a well-known challenging 
control problem. Over the past decades, 
numerous inverted pendulum systems with 
different mechanical configurations have been 
developed for control education and research, 
such as cart-pole system [1], double-link 
inverted pendulum system: Acrobot [2], 
double-link inverted pendulum system: 
Pendubot [3], rotary inverted pendulum system 
[4], inertia wheel pendulum system [5], double-
link inverted pendulum system [6], triple-link 
inverted pendulum system [7]. All the 
aforementioned systems are planar inverted 
pendulum systems with links constrained to 
move within a fixed plane. These experimental 
setups provide challenging experiments and 
high-impact visual demonstrations that make 
them attractive to students. Moreover, because 
of inherent nonlinearity, instability, and 
underactuation, these inverted pendulum 
systems are widely used as a benchmark for 
verifying the performance and effectiveness of 
new control algorithms or technology. A 
spherical inverted pendulum is a rod attached to 
a horizontal movable base with a universal joint. 
The universal joint is free to move in the plane. 
It is a two-dimensional inverted pendulum. 
Stabilization problems of a spherical inverted 
pendulum have been studied in [8]-[12]. In 
[13]-[15], the X-Y table was used to provide the 
controlled planar force. In [16] and [17], the 
spherical inverted pendulum was actuated by a 
robot arm. 
 Due to structural simplicity and highly 
static stability, wheels have been by far the 
most commonly used locomotion mechanism 
in mobile robotic applications. There are 
various types of wheeled mobile robots. Among 
them, the omnidirectional wheeled mobile 
robot is able to provide translational movement 
along any desired path combined with any 
rotational movement. This wheeled mobile 
robot has superior maneuverability and recently 
has attracted a lot of attentions in industrial 
applications and academic research [18]-[23]. 
Balance control of a spherical inverted 
pendulum requires a planar force. Motivated by 
the aforementioned facts, the aim of this 
research study is to design and implement 
balance control of a spherical inverted 
pendulum actuated by an omnidirectional 
mobile robot. The mathematical model of the 
spherical inverted pendulum with an 
omnidirectional wheeled mobile robot is 
derived to facilitate the control analysis and 
design. Based on sliding mode control and 
inverse dynamics, a stabilizing controller is 
designed to achieve locally asymptotic stability. 
The experimental apparatus is constructed and 
the designed control law is implemented

This detailed dynamic model is adopted to 
build a reliable and accurate simulation model 
for the later simulation studies. The dynamics 
given in (8)-(11) are highly coupled and 
nonlinear. They are far too complex for control 
design purposes, so model simplification is 
necessary.  This spherical inverted pendulum 
system is a two-dimensional extension of the 
car-pole system [1]. Assuming that the 
operating ranges of  and   are small, the 
high-order coupling terms are, therefore, small 
and negligible. The spherical inverted 
pendulum system can be treated as two 
decoupled car-pole systems as follows

2.2 Model of an Omnidirectional Mobile 
Robot  
Here presents the system modeling of an 
omnidirectional mobile robot. This 
mathematical model is derived by using the 
Newton’s laws [24]. Fig. 2 illustrates the basic 
features of the robot. Three wheels are equally 
spaced at 120° from one another. It is assumed 
that there is no slip in all wheels. Here oXYZ is 
the world frame, and m m moX Y Z  is the body 
frame attached to the robot with the mY -axis 
aligned with respect to the wheel 1.

Next, we introduce the relationship

system are generated by the omnidirectional

For balance control of the spherical inverted 
pendulum system, the rotational angle of the 
robot is set to zero. Thus, there is a need to 
design a controller to maintain the mobile robot 
without any rotational movement. To do so, a 
PD controller is designed to control the rational 
movement of the mobile robot as follows

5. Experimental Setup 
An experimental setup of the spherical 
inverted pendulum with an omnidirectional 
mobile robot has been constructed as shown in 
Fig. 6. The designed controller is implemented 
on a digital signal processor (DSP) board in the 
C language. This DSP board is based on the 
Texas Instruments TMS320F2812 (150 
MHz/32-bit) equipped with two quadrature 
encoder pulse (QEP) units. The sampling 
frequency of the system is chosen to be 1 kHz. 
The angular displacement of the pendulum is 
measured by two optical encoders with a 
resolution of 2000 pulses/rev. The quadrature 
encoder signals generated by the optical 
encoders attached to the pendulum are 
connected to the QEP unit on the DSP board. In 
order to obtain the angular displacement of the 
wheel, an optical encoder with a resolution of 
500 pulses/rev is attached to the shaft of each 
dc motor. The quadrature encoder signals 
generated by the optical encoders attached to 
the motors are connected to a QEP circuit that 
is implemented on an FPGA board for pre-
processing and then sent to DSP for feedback 
control. The PWM signals are generated 
according to the designed control law and also 
supplied to PWM driver circuits that drive each 
dc motor. 
 
6. Experimental Results 
The designed sliding mode control law 
and LQR control law were implemented and 
tested on the experimental setup shown in Fig. 
6.  
 
Fig. 6: Experimental setup. 
The experiments were conducted with the 
same initial conditions and controller 
parameters as in the simulation. The 
experimental results of the angular position 
responses of the pendulum, position responses 
of the robot, and trajectories of the robot are 
shown in Fig. 7, 8, and 9, respectively. The 
experimental results show that both designed 
control laws stabilize the spherical inverted 
pendulum system. For sliding mode control, the 
pendulum slightly oscillates in the upright 
position within a range of 2  in the angle of 
 , and a range of 2  in the angle of  . For 
LQR control, the pendulum slightly oscillates 
in the upright position within a range of 3  in 
the angle of  , and a range of 2.5  in the 
angle of  . From Fig. 8 and 9, it is also shown 
that the system with LQR control has a larger

此次會議中有許多議程與控制理論的應用有關，由此可見，針對控制理論的實
務應用，國外有很多學者正積極尋找控制理論可應用的範圍，並有相當多的研究成
果產出，此趨勢與本人的理念一致，本人日後亦會依此方向做更深入的研究。此次

Abstract—This paper presents the design, implementation and 
validation of a vision-based planar juggler control system. The 
system uses an image sensor to measure the position of a ball. 
This spatial information is then used to generate the control 
command to control a revolute bar to iterate batting the ball to 
keep it in the air with the specified apex. The system consists of a 
ball-batting mechanism, image processing module, image sensor, 
digital signal processor (DSP). In this system, the image 
processing is implemented on a field programmable gate array 
(FPGA) device to meet real-time constraints. A complementary 
metal-oxide silicon (CMOS) image sensor is used to acquire the 
image data. The control law is implemented on a DSP. Based on 
the position and velocity of the ball, the control law determines 
the corresponding hitting time and hitting angle to control the 
motor to drive the batting mechanism. The effectiveness of the 
designed control system is demonstrated through the simulation 
and experimental results.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Visual servoing [1] is a control framework that incorporates 
visual information in feedback control loops and has played a 
key role in many fields, such as robotics [2, 3], industrial 
automation [4], and automated vehicle guidance [5]. It involves 
results from many areas, including image processing, 
kinematics, dynamics, control theory, and real-time 
computation. Real-time image data acquisition and processing 
is a critical issue in visual servoing applications. A high frame 
rate and low processing latency is essential since the visual 
servoing system must make quick decisions based on the 
information extracted from a scene. To meet real-time 
constraints, the development of visual servoing systems usually 
requires high-cost specialized hardware and software. This 
presents serious obstacles to the design of real-time visual 
servoing systems. Real-time image processing imposes serious 
demands on a high pixel processing rate, massive and parallel 
computation, and hardware utilization. General-purpose 
processors cannot always provide enough computational power 
to fulfill real-time requirements due to their sequential nature. 
Due to their inherent architectural parallelism and configurable 
flexibility, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have 
become increasingly popular as implementation platforms for a 
wide variety of applications [6-8]. Real-time image processing 
benefits greatly from the real-time processing capabilities and 
flexibility of FPGAs. In [9], an FPGA/DSP architecture was 
proposed for real-time image processing. This architecture was 
designed to deal with parallel/pipelined procedures to handle 
multiple input images. 
The juggling of a ball using a robot is to iterate batting the 
ball and  to regulate the hitting position and the height of the 
flying ball. Many studies [10-13] have reported the control of 
the juggling systems using the machine vision system. In [10],  
a control algorithm was proposed to control a planar juggler  
for juggling two balls simultaneously. [11] proposed open loop 
stable control strategies for paddle juggling  to achieve a 
constant bouncing height and period. In [12], a mobile robot 
was used to track, catch, and iterate batting the ball with the 
single camera.  In [13], a method was proposed to achieve 
paddle juggling of a ball by a racket attached to a robot 
manipulator with two cameras. 
This paper presents the control design and implementation 
of juggling using the real-time vision feedback. The position of 
the ball is measured with a machine vision system that uses an 
image sensor with a frame rate of 60 frames per second to 
guarantee certain level of real-time performance. The pipelined 
image processing of the machine vision system is implemented 
on an FPGA device to meet real-time constraints. The dynamic 
model of the system is derived to facilitate control design and 
system simulation. The experimental apparatus is constructed 
and the control law is implemented through a digital signal 
processor (DSP).  The effectiveness of the controller is 
validated through simulation and experimental results. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II, 
a brief description of the experimental setup is given. Section 
III describes the relationship between the world coordinates 
and the image coordinates of a machine vision system. The 
image processing algorithms for determining the position of the 
ball from the image data are introduced. The dynamic model of 
a planer juggler system is derived in Section IV. In Section V, 
the design of the controller for the system is given. The 
simulation and experimental results are given in Section VI. 
Finally, Section VII contains some concluding remarks. 
II. DESSCRPTION OF THE EXPERIMANTAL SETUP 
The schematic overview of the experimental setup is shown 
in “Fig. 1”. The system consists of a revolute bar which is 
mounted to the shaft of a dc motor. The dc motor is rated at 
750 W, 24 V, and 1200 rpm. The optical encoder with a 
resolution of 500 pulses/rev is attached to the shaft of the dc 
motor to measure the angular position of the bar. The position 
of the ball is measured with a machine vision system, which 
consists of a camera, static random access memory (SRAM), 
and an FPGA board. The camera can capture 164×124  pixels 
quantized to 256 grey-levels at 60 frames per second.  The 
SRAM (2M bits) acts as a frame buffer, which is used for 
storing an image during camera calibration. The FPGA board is 
used to implement the image processing algorithms written in 
VHDL and Verilog hardware description language. The FPGA 
board is based on an Altera Cyclone EP1C12Q240C8 FPGA. 
The controller is implemented on a DSP board, which is based 
on the Texas Instruments TMS320F2812 digital signal 
processor (150-MHz/32-bit) equipped with a pulse width

Ideally, the thresholding operation separates the target 
object from the background. As shown in “Fig. 3”, the white 
pixels correspond to the ball. Because the ball is symmetrical, 
the centroid of the white pixels is taken as the location of the 
ball. The centroid ( , )c cx y  is given by

In order to process the image data in real-time, the image 
processing algorithms are implemented on an FPGA using 
VHDL and Verilog. FPGA technology is chosen because it 
provides massive amounts of reprogrammable hardware 
acceleration and parallel/pipelined processing. There is no 
iterative process in this study. Thus, the processing can be fully 
pipelined in the hardware implementation to improve 
efficiency and provide a high data throughput rate. In order for 
the DSP board to communicate with the FPGA, a 16-bit bus 
connected to the data bus of the DSP board is used for data 
exchange. The read/write commands are specified with 
different addresses. The proposed design can process 60 grey-
level images with a resolution of 164×124 pixels per second. 
IV. SYSTEM MODELING 
In this section, we derive the mathematical model of the 
planar juggler system. “Fig. 4” illustrates the basic features of 
the system.  
The system variables and parameters are defined as follows: 
W W WF X Y : world frame. 
I I IF X Y : impact frame. 
g : gravitational acceleration ( 2m sec ). 
 : angular displacement of the bar (rad). 
r : distance from the center of the bar to the impact point ( m ). 
pV : velocity of the bar at the impact point ( m sec ). 
The origin of the world frame W W WF X Y  locates at the 
center of the bar shaft, and the origin of the impact frame 
I I IF X Y  is at the impact point and IX -axis is aligned with the 
bar. The state of the ball in the world frame is define as

where xS and yS  are the position in the WX and WY axes, 
respectively, and xV and yV  are the velocity in the WX and 
WY axes. The free flight model of a ball is given by

We consider the impact event under the following 
assumptions [10]. First, we assume that impact between the 
ball and bar occurs instantaneously and can be described via a 
coefficient of restitution law. Second, we idealize the sliding 
ball to be a point mass and neglect the width of the bar as well. 
Thus, the friction is neglected. According to impact of rigid 
bodies [16], the velocity of a ball after impact in the I I IF X Y  
coordinate frame is given by

The pole placement design technique [17] is then used to 
design a state feedback control 
 ( ) ( )j b ju t Kw t    (18) 
for this set point control problem. Because the ball-batting 
command (18) cannot be directly used to control the motor to 
drive the bar, the ball-batting command is transformed into a 
motor control command, and a PID controller is then used to 
control the motor. The block diagram of the ball-batting control 
system is shown in “Fig. 6”. 
To obtain the motor control command, from “Fig. 4”, we   have 
 1 p

where   is the angular velocity of the motor. Thus, the desired 
angular velocity of the motor is given in (19). Consider the 
impact event as shown in “Fig. 7”. At the moment of  impact, 
the angular displacement of the bar is

The motor control command is based on velocity control with a 
velocity command given in (19). To control the bar to reach the 
desired angular displacement given in (20) at time 1jt  , a 
specified starting time of the velocity command need to be 
determined. With a fixed angular velocity 
2.278 (rad / sec)  , we obtain the relationship between the 
angular displacement of the motor and time from experiments. 
The least-squares approximation is then used to obtain a power 
series polynomial model as follows

A comparison between the measured response of the motor and

approximated response shows a good agreement with the 
measurement. Base on (20) and (21), we can determine the 
starting time of the velocity command.
