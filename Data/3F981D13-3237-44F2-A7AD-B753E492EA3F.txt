1. Introduction 
Soldering process has been extensively studied because of its wide applications in bonding 
components in electronic devices.  Most of the researches on the Cu/Sn interaction have been conducted 
by the reflow process followed by long–term annealing.  The reflow temperature is dependent on the 
melting point of the solder, i.e., above 183 ºC for the eutectic Sb–Pb solder, above 232 ºC for pure Sn, 
and generally above 200 ºC for Pb–free solders.  In these solders, Sn is the main reacting element which 
interacts with Cu substrate to form the Cu–Sn intermetallic compound (IMC).  Previous results showed 
that Cu6Sn5 forms very rapidly at the Cu/Sn interface and Cu3Sn forms later between Cu6Sn5 and Cu 
[1–11]. 
Even though there are a lot of researches in this field, only recently the orientation relationships 
between η–Cu6Sn5 and Cu were first reported.  Suh et al. [12] used Cu single crystal to react with molten 
Sn at 250 ºC for 4 minutes and quenched the specimen to room temperature to retain the high temperature 
η–Cu6Sn5 phase.  As the η–Cu6Sn5 layer was relatively thick, the orientation relationship was analyzed 
by synchrotron micro–x–ray diffraction (XRD) [12].  Zou et al. [13] prepared the (001)Cu, (011)Cu, and 
(111)Cu surfaces from Cu single crystals to react with molten Sn at 260 ºC for 5 to 600 seconds and the 
specimens were air–cooled to room temperature to form the low temperature η′–Cu6Sn5 phase.  The 
orientation relationships between η′–Cu6Sn5 and Cu on the (001)Cu and (111)Cu surfaces were determined 
by backscattered-electron diffraction in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and orientation 
relationships were found only on the (001)Cu and (111)Cu surfaces [13].  The Cu6Sn5 grains on the 
molten Sn side have a roof–type shape [13, 14] which has two variants on the (001)Cu surface and three 
variants on the (111)Cu surface.  They turn gradually into a scallop–type shape with further aging [13].   
The η′–Cu6Sn5 phase, which has a monoclinic structure, is stable below 186 ºC while the η–Cu6Sn5 
phase is stable above the temperature due to an order–disorder transition.  The crystal structure of 
η–Cu6Sn5 was determined to be hexagonal [15], but detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
analysis showed that it can be indexed as a monoclinic structure [16].  Recent analysis by synchrotron 
micro–XRD showed that the monoclinic structure can better fit the experimental XRD patterns [12].  In 
the present TEM analysis it is found that both the hexagonal system [15] and the monoclinic system [12, 
16] can be adequately used to index the observed electron diffraction patterns.  In this report the 
hexagonal system is used for easier understanding and comparison with JCPDS file [15].  The hexagonal 
indexes are converted to the monoclinic ones [16] when our results are compared with previous results 
[12, 14] in the Discussion section. 
The thickness of Cu6Sn5 after the reflow and annealing process is usually in the µm range, which is 
too thick to be observed directly with TEM.  That is the reason why the orientation relationships 
between Cu6Sn5 and Cu were previously studied by high–intensity synchrotron XRD [12] or by SEM 
backscattered-electron diffraction [13].  The purpose of this research is to use TEM to study the 
interfaces and the orientation relationships between them on plane–view specimens.  The microstructure 
of η–Cu6Sn5 is also analyzed with TEM and SEM to study its nucleation and growth in the early stage of 
formation. 
 
2. Experimental details 
Cu foil (99.9% pure) 0.1 mm thick was cut into 1 cm × 2 cm rectangles and annealed in vacuum at 
 4 
indexed to be η–Cu6Sn5 in the [1120] η zone.  Fig. 4b shows the SAD pattern of η–Cu6Sn5 in the [0001]η 
zone, which was obtained by tilting the specimen in Fig. 4a.  This further confirms that the IMC is 
indeed η–Cu6Sn5. 
The SAD patterns of both η–Cu6Sn5 and Cu are shown in Fig. 5.  In Fig. 5a, the SAD pattern 
consists of Cu in the [001]Cu zone axis and two variants of η–Cu6Sn5 in the [1120] η zone axis (Fig. 4a).  
The orientation relationship, designated as type 1, is Z=[1120] η//[001]Cu, (0001)η//(110)Cu, and 
(1100) η// (110) Cu (variant 1).  The variant 2 has an equivalent orientation relationship.  In Fig. 5b the 
SAD pattern consists of Cu in the [111]Cu zone axis and three variants of η–Cu6Sn5 in the [1120] η zone 
axis.  The epitaxial orientation relationship, designated as type 2, is Z=[1120] η//[111]Cu, (0001)η//(110)Cu , 
and (1100) η// (112) Cu (variant 1).  In this experiment, the (111) Cu surface was observed much more 
frequently than the (100)Cu surface.  However, no (110)Cu surface was observed, and the orientation 
relationship on that surface can not be determined experimentally. 
The TEM micrographs in Fig. 6 show the microstructure of η–Cu6Sn5 as the Cu and Sn on the 
η–Cu6Sn5 surfaces have all been removed.  Since the TEM electrons can pass through the specimen, the 
microstructure through the thickness of the η–Cu6Sn5 layer can be observed.  The large thick grains 0.5 
to 1 µm in size, appearing dark in the BFIs of Figs. 6a and 6c, are the worm–type grains on the molten Sn 
side in Fig. 2a.  The white regions in Figs. 6a and 6c were over-exposed intentionally to show the details 
of the dark grains.  These regions are very thin and are visible in the DFIs of Figs. 6b and 6d, which 
show that the microstructures are much finer than the large grains and that the two variants in Fig. 6b and 
the three variants in Fig. 6d are intimately mixed.  Some grains are very small, which should be the very 
fine grains on the Cu side.  Fig. 7 is a high resolution lattice fringes image, which shows that the 
smallest grains of η–Cu6Sn5 are ~ 5 nm in size.  In the figure several grains are in the process of 
coalescence, such as the irregularly–shaped grain marked with A and several smaller grains which are in 
contact. 
 
4. Discussion 
It is known that Cu6Sn5 forms first at Cu/Sn interface and then Cu3Sn forms afterward between 
Cu6Sn5 and Cu.  During the reflow process the Cu3Sn was reported in the literature to form at 245 ºC – 4 
min in molten Sn [9], 255 ºC – 5 min in a molten Sn–Cu solution [10], 200 ºC – 2 min in the eutectic 
Sn–Pb solution [17], and 150 ºC – 10 min in a solid–state Cu/Sn couple [18].  Therefore in the 
experiment by Suh et al. at 250 ºC – 4 min in molten Sn [12], the Cu3Sn phase has probably already 
formed.  To avoid this possibility, in the present experiment the reaction time is limited to only 1 second 
at 250 ºC and the XRD (Fig. 1) and the TEM SAD patterns (Figs. 4, 5) show that no Cu3Sn is present. 
4.1. Orientation relationships and interfaces 
 6 
(100)Cu surfaces could be prepared relatively easily on the (111)NaCl and (100)NaCl surfaces, respectively.  
But on the (110)NaCl surface, although a Cu film of 100% (110) texture was obtained, results showed that 
the surface actually consisted of only (111)Cu facets but no (110)Cu surface.  Similar results were also 
observed on Au, which has similar surface properties as Cu [22].  The texture can be conveniently 
analyzed by XRD or TEM SAD and have been extensively studied for Cu foil and its alloys in various 
forms such as foils, films, and wires.  However, the actual surface can be completely different from the 
texture and takes other methods to determine, as shown previously on Cu and Au thin films [21, 22].  
Since the {111}Cu and {001}Cu textures were found to be most prominent for Cu films after annealing 
[23], the actual surfaces are probably the {111}Cu and {001}Cu planes in this case.  But for other texture 
the surface may not be the same as the texture. 
However, if we assume that the orientation relationship (0001) η//(110)Cu is still obeyed and that the 
(1120) η surface is still the interface with the (110)Cu surface, the inferred stereograph and interface are 
shown in Fig. 11.  Fig. 11a is obtained by rotating the Cu stereograph in Fig. 8a around the [110]Cu axis 
by 90º to bring the [110]Cu axis to be parallel to the [1120] η direction, similar to the process used to bring 
Fig. 8a into 8b.  The orientation relationship is then Z=[1120] η//[110]Cu, (0001) η//(110)Cu and 
[1100]η// (001) Cu (type 3).  In Fig. 11b the mismatch in the [0001] η and [110]Cu directions is the same as 
before (–0.27%).  In the [1100]η and [001]Cu directions, the mismatch between the (1100) η plane 
(0.7285 nm) and every two (001) Cu planes (0.7232 nm) is –0.73%.  The match in Cu atom positions is 
apparently even better than those in Fig. 9c (type 1) and Fig. 10c (type 2). 
4.2 Comparison with previous results 
Suh et al. [12] found six orientation relationships, numbered from (1) to (6), by synchrotron 
micro–XRD diffraction.  To compare our results with theirs the monoclinic structure (m) instead of the 
hexagonal structure (h) has to be used and the equivalent orientations between the two systems are 
[101]m//[1120] h, (101) m//(0001)h, and (010)m// (1100) h [16].  Our results can then be rewritten as: 
Type 1: Z=[101]m=[001]Cu, (101) m//(110)Cu, and (010)m// (110) Cu, 
Type 2: Z=[101]m =[111]Cu, (101) m//(110)Cu, and (010)m// (112) Cu, 
Type 3: Z=[101]m=[110]Cu, (101) m//(110)Cu, and (010)m// (001) Cu. 
It is to be noted that since a0 = c0 = 0.984 nm in the monoclinic structure, the [101]m and [101]m 
directions are perpendicular to the (101)m and (101) m planes, respectively.  The type 1 orientation

η–Cu6Sn5 on different Cu surfaces.  The η–Cu6Sn5 in different orientation and thickness may then have 
different strength and thermo–fatigue behavior of the soldering joints.  Systematic studies of these 
properties may be used to improve the dependability of the joints.   
Furthermore, the ε–Cu3Sn phase, which grows later between η–Cu6Sn5 and Cu, also has a significant 
effect on the strength of the joint.  With further annealing of the present specimens, η–Cu6Sn5 can be 
transformed into ε–Cu3Sn and the orientation relationships and interfaces between ε–Cu3Sn and Cu on the 
(001)Cu and (111) Cu surfaces can be determined.  It is well known that any orientation relationship and 
coherency can significantly reduce the interfacial energy and that reduced interfacial energy can 
significantly increase the nucleation rate of a new phase.  These may affect the nucleation rates of 
η–Cu6Sn5 and ε–Cu3Sn on the (001)Cu and (111) Cu surfaces, and determine the first phase to appear.  
With the free energies of formation and the activation energies of growth of η–Cu6Sn5 and ε–Cu3Sn 
available in the literature, it may provide a way to analyze the nucleation and growth rates of these two 
phases. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The initial stage of growth of η–Cu6Sn5 has been studied on specimens prepared by dipping Cu foil 
into molten Sn bath at 240 ºC for 1 second.  The η–Cu6Sn5 grains have a worm–type appearance 0.3–0.5 
µm wide and 1–2 µm long on the Sn side but can be as small as 5 nm on the Cu side.  The η–Cu6Sn5 
grains nucleate on the Cu side and grow rapidly into the worm–type shape on the molten Sn side. 
The orientation relationship between η–Cu6Sn5 and Cu observed on the (001)Cu surface is 
[1120] η//[001]Cu (zone axes), (0001)η//(110)Cu, (1100) η// (110) Cu, and on the (111) Cu surface is 
[1120] η//[111]Cu (zone axes), (0001)η// (110) Cu (1100) η// (112) Cu.  The (1120) η is the surface forming 
the interface with both the (001)Cu and (111) Cu surfaces.  On both interfaces, the (0001)η plane is 
parallel to the (110)Cu plane, which is due to a very small misfit of -0.27% between them.  The match of 
atoms on the interfaces is analyzed.
