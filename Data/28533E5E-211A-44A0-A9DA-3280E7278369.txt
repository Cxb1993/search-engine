Abstract—A particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is 
applied to finding the optimum degree distributions of check and 
bit nodes of an irregular low-density parity–check (LDPC) code. 
This population based optimization method can efficiently 
reduce the number of evaluations of the computation demanding 
fitness function. We also show how to find the thresholds under 
message-passing (MP) algorithm. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
n 1962 Gallager first discovered low-density parity-
check (LDPC) codes [2]. In 1993 turbo codes were 
discovered [3] and LDPC codes were rediscovered in 
1997 [4]. Both turbo and LDPC codes can approach the 
Shannon capacity limit for long code lengths. The advantages 
of LDPC codes over turbo codes are that decoding is 
parallelizable and the design and optimization methods can 
utilize the bipartite graph [5]. Due to the parallel decoding 
structure, high speed decoding is possible without using large 
amount of memory size and complexity of algorithm. The 
parallel structure has been shown to achieve over 100 Mb/s 
throughput compared with the 10 Mb/s throughputs of turbo 
codes [15]. Irregular LDPC codes can yield even lower 
thresholds than regular LDPC ones for large code length by 
optimizing the degree profiles of the variable and the check 
nodes through density evolution [6]. 
By using the message passing algorithm for decoding a 
LDPC code, it is possible to have error free decoding if the 
degree distribution of the parity check matrix satisfies certain 
constraints. Under this case, the code exhibits a signal-to-
noise (SNR) threshold. 
After we accurately find the threshold for a specific degree 
distribution of a LDPC code, the threshold can be used as a 
fitness function for selecting a good LDPC code. In general, 
this is a nonlinear optimization problem. A population based 
method will be adopted due to the advantage that no 
differentiation of error surface is needed and the error surface 
may not be known. Because the traditional intelligent 
optimization methods such as genetic algorithm (GA), 
evolutionary algorithm (EA) may not converge fast due to 
their exploration of vast possible solution area, we will adopt 
the particle swarm optimization (PSO), which has similar 
performance but it has simpler algorithm with both global and 
local search abilities. The main difference between them is 
that PSO adjusts the flying velocity of each particle instead of 
the operators, such as combination, mutation, and selection of 
the EA or GA. 
II. DEGREE DISTRIBUTION DESIGN BY USING PSO 
It is well known that for LDPC codeword of infinite length, 
the bit-error rate approaches zero when an iterative decoder is 
used. And it is also known that irregular LDPC codes may 
perform better than regular ones. We have shown that the later 
always have thresholds, while the former may not have 
depending on the existence condition 1)('1
1 ≥− xfη . 
Therefore, we shall consider the degree distribution design for 
error free LDPC irregular codes, which have thresholds. 
Because the optimization of degree distribution may be 
highly nonlinear, we shall consider population based ones. 
The bottleneck for this kind of method may be the evaluation 
of the fitness function, which may take a long evaluation cost.  
The threshold of a LDPC code is the lower bound of the 
required SNR of all iterative decoding or density evolution 
methods with the corresponding degree distributions. It 
reflects the worst case that the LDPC code can overcome and 
may be used as an important evaluation criterion for the 
fitness of each solution. 
To optimize the design of LDPC codes in the degree 
distribution space, we will search for those with the lowest 
threshold values. The algorithm is good for both regular and 
irregular codes because the former is a special case of the later. 
An all-1 codeword will be assumed, then the density evolution 
will depend only on the channel parameter 2ch /2 σ=m . 
To optimize the degree distribution we need to optimize the 
coefficients of the degree distribution polynomial satisfying 
the following constraints:

It has been shown that the optimal degree distribution of

We will assume that both 
)(lu
 and )(lv  are consistent 
Gaussian random variables such that )(lu ~ )2,( ll μμN  and 
)(lv ~ )2,( lmlmN , where )
2,( σmN  denotes a normal 
random variable with mean m and variance 2σ . 
Taking the expected value of (6) we have

Because the function )(mΨ  does not have a close form, 
numerical value or approximation will be evaluated. A first 
approximation is )2/tanh()( mm ≈Ψ , but usually accurate 
numerical values are wanted.  To reach the goal we shall 
present a transformation method to accurately compute 
)(mΨ . After the transformation the trapezoidal rule can be 
easily applied and has a good accuracy about 9 decimal digits 
[11]. 
Let 22/2)( σmwp −= . We have

To use the trapezoidal rule we take the following 
transformations [10]:

and we have 
 ∫ ∞∞− −+−=Ψ dxxeueuufm )2/1(2/1)(

)( π  (13) 
Because the integrand )(uf  changes much slower than 
ue− , then by making the substitution (12), we can calculate 
the integral by using the trapezoidal rule, which is 
conveniently applied to computing the integral as 
 ∑= Δ+−Δ≈Ψ

iHm ,  (14) 
where 
 )2/1(2/1)(

)( xeueuufxH −+−= π , (15) 
and Δ  is the step size. The numbers 44 and 3.3 are taken by 
trial and error because the dominate part of the integral comes 
from the region ]3.3,3.3[−  and Δ  is taken to be .15, which 
yields results of about 9 digits accuracy. The accuracy can be 
checked by continuing halving the step size. After the 
transformation, the singular point 0=u  will not be evaluated, 
and the integrand behaves well enough for using trapezoidal 
rule. Our results showed that about 50 intervals may yield 9 
digits of accuracy. 
In the following we will show how to find the thresholds 
for both regular and irregular LDPC codes by using two 
curves.

we will drop the subscripts m and n. Based on the iteration

As illustrated in Figure 2 the two curves can intercept at 
two, one, or no point. For the first case, decoding failures may 
occur. For the second case, thresholds can be located. For the 
last one, an iterative tunnel exists [13]. As shown in [15] when 
an iterative decoding tunnel is formed between these two 
curves, messages can evolve to infinity when an iterative 
decoding is adopted. Figure 1 shows the curves of )(1 xf  and 
)(2 xf  of a regular rate 1/2 LDPC code.  
solution. When the threshold of a given set of degree 
distribution is used as the fitness value, our method may be 
faster and more accurate than traditional ones..
