composed of three terms which are related to the values of 
power and interference. The simulation results indicate that 
three portions with an appropriate value of the weighting 
factors make the initial allocation strategy better than the 
greedy loading-based schemes [13-17]. In order to further 
improve the performance, a refinement approach is applied. 
A few extra operations are required. 
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Assume that the spectrum has M bands with the bandwidth 
B Hz. LM  bands are distributed to L PUs. C LM M M   
bands can be used by K CR users. CM  bands have N OFDM 
subcarriers whose bandwidth of each subcarrier is f  Hz. 
The problem to assign subcarriers to CR users and to allocate 
power to subcarriers for maximizing the capacity of CR users 
is studied in this project. The problem is subject to the power 
and interference constraints in OFDM-based multiuser CR 
uplink systems. The mutual interference is discussed in [4].

CR user to the mth band for the lth PU can be written as

the CR users are separate, but the amount of the mutual 
interference to the PUs is aggregated from all CR users. How 
to assign subcarriers to users and allocate power to 
subcarriers with considering the power and interference 
constraints for the uplink in the multi-CR users and multi-
PUs scenario becomes challenging. In this project, we 
propose an allocation scheme plus a refinement algorithm to 
efficiently use the limited resource for achieving a good 
performance. 
III. PROPOSED ALLOCATION SCHEMES 
The allocation strategy is to assign subcarriers to users and 
to allocate power to subcarriers simultaneously by utilizing a 
proposed indicator. In order to further improve the

If the peak power, the used power, and the caused 
interference are all satisfied with the constraints, i.e. 
* * ,,
ˆ k nk np p , 
*k k
ed thP P  and l led thI I , one more increment in 
capacity C  is increased on the selected subcarrier *n  of CR 
user *k . Once a selected subcarrier *n  is assigned to a CR 
user, other users are not allowed to use the assigned 
subcarrier.

And then, the used power and the introduced interference are 
updated. If the constraints are not satisfied, that selected 
subcarrier *n  is not considered for allocating power for CR 
user *k  thereafter. Go to the next step. 
Step A5: Repeat Step A2 until all subcarriers are considered 
or the power and interference constraints are not satisfied. 
The achievable capacity (5) is obtained. 
B. Iterative Improvement Approach 
We use an iterative improvement approach to re-allocate 
subcarriers to users. The performance of the initial allocation 
strategy can be further improved. Iterative subcarrier 
allocation schemes for OFDM multiuser systems are 
demonstrated to obtain better performances in [18-19]. These 
two schemes   are composed of the initial and the iterative 
steps.  We may treat the proposed initial allocation strategy as 
an initial solution. After the proposed initial allocation 
strategy, an iterative improvement approach is used to 
enhance the performance. The iterative improvement 
approach is described as follows.  
The iterative improvement approach is performed with 
either a subcarrier swapping or a subcarrier reallocation 
operation after the proposed initial allocation strategy. The 
swapping operation is that a subcarrier assigned to CR user i 
is reallocated to CR user j and a subcarrier assigned to CR 
user j is reallocated to CR user i to improve performance. All 
swapping cases between paired CR users are listed to form 
the capacity improvement list  ,i jC : 
 
, , ,i j i j j iC C C                                                             (12) 
 
where ,i jC is the amount of the capacity improvement for the 
paired CR user (i, j) by the subcarrier swapping . On the 
other hand, the subcarrier reallocation operation in the 
iterative improvement approach is to re-assign a subcarrier 
owned by one CR user to another CR user. The numbers of 
subcarriers for CR users are adjusted. The capacity 
improvement factor *,i jC  for the reallocation operation is 
defined as  
 
* * *
, , ,i j i j j iC C C                                                             (13) 
 
where    *, 1i j i iC C N C N    and 
   *, 1j i j jC C N C N    . The merged capacity 
improvement list by combining  ,i jC  and  * ,i jC  becomes 
 
*
, ,{ } { } { }merge i j i jC C C                                                  (14) 
 
In both operations, there are various possible subcarrier 
swapping and reallocation cases between CR user i and CR 
user j. Only the case associated with the maximum capacity 
improvement is selected to be a candidate to swap or 
reallocate subcarriers between paired CR users, respectively. 
The case in { }mergeC  with the maximum capacity 
improvement is selected and the associated operation is 
performed in an iterative fashion. The iteration stops when 
neither the swapping nor the reallocation operation can 
improve the capacity. The number of subcarriers for each CR 
user kN  would be different from the number determined in 
the proposed initial allocation strategy. Note that, once 
subcarriers are re-allocated to users, power allocation should 
be applied for obtaining the achievable capacity. After re-
allocating subcarriers to user, the set of subcarriers kA  and 
the number of subcarriers kN  for each CR user, 1 to k K  , 
is known. Power is only allocated to the assigned subcarriers. 
The power allocation procedure is designed as the following: 
Step B1: The initial capacity for the nth subcarrier of the kth 
CR user , 0k nC  , the initial used power 0kedP  , 
1 to k K  , and the initial introduced  interference 0ledI  ,  
1 to l L  . 
Step B2: Return to Step A2. Calculate the power increment 
,k np   (6) and interference increment ,lk nI   (7) for those 
assigned subcarriers. Choose a subcarrier with the minimum 
value of the proposed indicator (8). Go to the next step. 
Step B3: Return to Step A4. Perform the power allocation 
procedure. Repeat Step B2 until the power and interference 
constraints are not satisfied. The capacity (5) is obtained. 
In the initial allocation strategy, the complexity of the step 
to calculate the proposed indicator (8) is ( ( ))P IO KN N N+  
for all users and subcarriers. PN  and IN  are the number of 
total power and interference constraints. The next step for 
selecting users and subcarriers requires a complexity of 
( )O KN . iterN  iterations are needed for allocating power. The 
complexity of the initial allocation strategy is 
( ( ( ) )) ( ( ))iter P I iter P IO N KN N N KN O N KN N N+ + » + . In 
the iterative improvement approach, only assigned 
subcarriers are considered. The complexity for calculating the 
proposed indicator (8) is ( ( ))P IO N N N+ . The next step to 
choose a subcarrier with allocating power requires a 
complexity of ( )O N .  The complexity of the iterative 
improvement approach is ( ( ( ) ))iter P IO N N N N N+ + »  
( ( ))iter P IO N N N N+ . The total complexity of the proposed 
two-phase allocation scheme is

   Abstract—In some frame-based OFDM applications such as 
WLAN and WMAN, the channel estimation is accomplished 
through the aid of the preamble. By means of the preamble, the 
estimated channel is only well applied under the assumption of a 
static channel status within the frame. If we consider a 
time-varying channel status in those applications, the channel 
tracking has to be performed without the aid of pilots. A past 
idea for channel tracking was to use a decision-feedback loop 
with a smoothing method to reduce the drawback of 
decision-error propagation. In our work, we design the error 
detectors for detecting error propagation and propose some 
compensation methods for reducing the influence of error 
propagation. In simulation results, the performance of the 
proposed decision-error detectors and compensation methods is 
compared. We show that the smaller bit error rate can be 
achieved for the proposed time domain decision feedback 
algorithm and thus, bandwidth efficiency can remain without 
the pilots used for channel tracking. 
Index Terms–OFDM, channel tracking, error propagation, 
decision-feedback, bandwidth efficiency. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) 
technology plays an important role in modern and future 
communication services. It has been widely adopted in 
wireless networking and broadcasting applications (e.g. 
WLAN, WiMAX, and DVB-T, etc) and will remain in place 
in next generation standards. A main advantage of OFDM is 
its high bandwidth efficiency and simple equalization. In 
contrast to traditional equalization methods in a single carrier 
communication system, the OFDM system can eliminate 
intersymbol interference (ISI) when the length of CP is longer 
than the delay spread of the channel impulse response. And 
consequently, the operations of FFT and IFFT enable the 
equalization to be implemented by dividing the channel state 
information (CSI). Hence, if CSI is available, coherent 
demodulation can be performed easily by simple single-tap 
equalizers. 
In order to achieve a good performance at the receiver in 
high-speed wireless systems, accurate channel estimates are 
required. Usually, channel estimation and tracking are 
accomplished by employing preambles or regular pilots. The 
conventional pilot-aided algorithms were explored in [1]. 
Reliable estimation results are obtained relying on a sufficient 
number of  pilots. However, the overhead due to pilots leads 
to a considerable loss to the overall throughput. Recently, 
 
This work was supported in part by the National Science Council of Taiwan 
under contracts NSC 98-2221-E-008-036 and NSC 98-2221-E-008-038. 
several studies have focused their efforts on reducing the 
overhead due to pilots used in OFDM systems. Channel 
estimation and tracking performed by decision-feedback (DF) 
techniques have been proposed [2]-[8]. Decision-Feedback 
algorithms have the good property that there is no 
communication overhead required. Typically, DF techniques 
for channel tracking are performed in the frequency domain 
[4], [5]. In this paper, we develop a time-domain channel 
tracking algorithm with an error-preventing structure. The 
time-domain method could be found in MIMO applications 
[7] and has good tracking capability because it tracks fewer 
channel parameters than the frequency-domain method. 
Hence, estimation errors are spread over the whole frequency 
band, which means we can obtain more reliable channel 
estimation by using the time-domain method.  
However, the DF technique possibly incurs error 
propagation. In order to prevent propagated errors, we 
propose two error indicators to detect possible decision 
errors. We observe that the decision error usually occurs 
along with an abrupt change on the value of the estimated 
channel response. Another decision error situation emerges 
when the channel gain is below a certain level. Based on 
above observation, we also study a composite error detector 
and explore the property of some parameters used in the 
detector. As we decide a possible decision error, the estimated 
channel obtained by the decision feedback method is 
discarded since we think that the estimate is not reliable. And 
then, the channel value is replaced by the new result obtained 
from the proposed channel compensation methods. 
Simulation results show that the modified time-domain 
decision feedback method provides a better bit error rate 
(BER) performance than the conventional methods without 
utilizing the error-preventing decision feedback structure.  
II. CHANNEL TRACKING METHODS 
In high-speed wireless systems, the channel is both time 
and frequency selective. In practice, we exploit preambles to 
capture the channel estimates in the acquisition mode, and use 
pilots for the follow-up tracking. However, if there are no 
pilots, we should track in the blind mode. In this paper, we 
propose a modified blind algorithm depended on the decision 
feedback algorithm.  
A. Frequency-Domain LS with Decision Feedback  
The frequency-domain decision feedback (FDF) solution is 
based on the LS criterion as follows:

IV. ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON 
In this section, we are interested in performance 
comparison of the error detector based on the analysis of its 
false alarms and fault detection rate. The fault detection 
means there is a decision error, but the detector misses it, and 
the false alarm means there is no decision error, but the 
detector has an alarm. Both of them degrade the tracking 
performance. First one can not avoid error-propagation, and 
another slows down the tracking speed.  
Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 compare the improvement of different 
error detectors at 20dB SNR. Notice that the probability of 
false alarm based on ( )kD n  is lower than that based on 
( )kT n , which means the error detector based on ( )kD n  is 
more reliable for error detection.

Fig. 7 shows the BER performance of TDF and FDF 
algorithm at 90 km/hr, and F is 50. Notice that extrapolation 
factor is 0.8. The compensation methods show obvious 
improvement because the error detector successfully detects 
the decision errors to prevent from the error propagation 
problem. And the smoothing method performs worse than the 
steady channel because it slows down the tracking speed by 
the forgetting factor. Hence, it would degrade the BER 
performance when the channel speed increases. 
Fig. 8 shows the MSE (dB) of estimated results and the true 
channel at 90 km/hr. Notice that the smoothing method is 
worse than the original TDF. Referral coefficients are as 
follows: 
 Smoothing factor = 0.1 
 Switch factor = 0.1 
 Extrapolation factor = 0.8 
Notice that smoothing factor is small, which means the 
effects of the previous estimate are very insensitive. However, 
it still degrades the tracking speed. And the switch factor is 
set as a small number in order to increase tracking speed. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
This paper presents low overhead channel tracking 
algorithm for mobile OFDM systems. Here, we show that the 
time-domain decision feedback algorithm works better than 
the frequency-domain decision feedback algorithm and we 
also show that the proposed channel compensation structure 
substantially improves the performance of both tracking 
methods. These modified decision-feedback channel tracking 
algorithms with the proposed channel compensation structure 
minimize the overhead required by pilots and training 
sequences.
