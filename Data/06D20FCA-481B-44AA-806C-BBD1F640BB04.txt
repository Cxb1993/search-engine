in BOLD signal (17). 
BOLD MRI is a measurement based on 
the local changes of oxygenation status of 
hemoglobin, which reflects the combined 
effect of oxygen extraction ratio, CBF, 
cerebral blood volume (CBV), hematocrit, 
and initial arterial oxygenation fraction 
(18-20). Furthermore, BOLD signal changes 
due to altered blood oxygenation appear not 
only in the microvessels, but also in the 
large draining veins and in the extravascular 
parenchymal tissues (21-24). Recently, 
vascular space occupancy (VASO) MRI 
was developed for CBV quantification in a 
manner that is independent of blood 
oxygenation and flow (25). Basically, 
VASO MRI is an inversion recovery 
gradient echo EPI technique in which the 
blood signal is selectively nulled. When 
images are acquired at the time of blood 
nulling, sufficient gray matter tissue 
magnetization remains for MRI detection 
due to different T1s between blood and 
tissue. As a consequence, changes in CBV 
can be assessed through changes in the 
remaining extravascular water signal of 
parenchymal tissue (25). It has been shown 
that there were inverse VASO signal 
changes during visual stimulation and 
breath holding, comparable to the BOLD 
signal increases, but with a lower magnitude 
(25,26). Most recently, VASO MRI was 
applied for CBV measurement in human 
brain tumor for tumor segmentation (27) or 
grading (28). 
In addition to normal blood vessels 
recruited from the host, tumors may also 
have abnormal blood vessels arising from 
angiogenesis (29). Since tumor 
neovasculature does not have normal 
microanatomy and lacks smooth muscles, 
vasodilatation and increased CBF mediated 
by the effects of reduced extracellular pH on 
the arterial side of normal capillary bed (16) 
are not expected. On the other hand, BOLD 
signal increases due to hypercapnia stress 
may still occur in tumor region where 
normal blood vessels exist. An increase in 
the BOLD signal or absence of BOLD 
signal changes during carbogen breathing 
has been reported in a variety of human 
tumors (10, 11). However, reduced CBF 
and decreased BOLD signals of tumors 
during carbogen breathing have been 
reported in both human and animal studies 
(30, 31). The contrary results may be due to 
various histopathologic components of 
different tumors and confounding vascular 
effects due to a mixture of hyperoxic and 
hypercapnic gases. 
 
研究方法 (Normal group): 
All measurements were performed on 
3T scanner (GE, Signa Excite). Since 
VASO MRI technique is based on inversion 
recovery (IR) GE EPI technique and will be 
applied during breath-hold condition, it is 
important to make sure IR pulse is applied 
to each measurement. The imaging 
parameters for IR GE EPI sequence are as 
followed: TR/TI/TD= 10s/871ms/1729ms. 
 We had 3 preliminary testing in vivo. 
The fMRI paradigm comprised of 4 periodic 
task cycles, with 30-sec on condition and 
30-sec off condition in each cycle. The 
breath-hold paradigm comprised of 4 
periodic cycles with 45-sec natural 
breathing and 15-sec breath holding. For the 
first test, the subject was asked to execute 
robust motor and breath-hold task. For the 
second test, the subject was asked to 
execute visual and breath-hold task. To 
avoid the inflow effect, a 5mm saturation 
band was applied. The imaging parameters 
for all the 3 tests were as follows: TR/TI/TD 
= 3000ms/871ms/1729ms, FOV = 192mm, 
slice thickness = 5mm, matrix size = 
128x128, in-plane resolution = 1.5 x 1.5 
mm2. 
 A total of six normal subjects (2 
women, 4 men, 19 - 26 year-old) were 
recruited for the normal subject group. They 
all gave consent forms for safety concern 
after being comprehensively explained. The 
breath-hold paradigm comprised of one 
preparation stage and three periodic 
breath-hold cycles. During the preparation

on a pixel-by-pixel basis. BOLD images 
were spatial smoothed by SPM2. An 
averaged signal-time course of normal 
appearing gray matters was used as the 
reference function. Pixels with significant 
changes in BOLD and VASO signal were 
then determined using a correlation analysis 
at a level of P<10-8 and P<0.001, 
respectively. Maximum signal change, 
FWHM and onset time (defined as the time 
to the first half maximum) were then 
determined from the averaged time curve of 
each breath-hold condition. 
 
結果 (Normal group): 
The SNR of the images acquired with 
and without MR compatible goggle are 
371.4 and 279.4. There was no apparent 
artifact on the images. 
 For the first test, we acquired motor 
and breath-hold VASO images. The 
activation map is shown in Fig. 1. The 
activation pattern is located in the motor 
area but fewer activation volumes. For 
breath-hold task, the activation pattern is 
quite sensitive in the gray matter.

breath-hold task (R) 
 
 
 To further evaluate the sensitivity of 
VASO images used in the fMRI study, the 
robust visual stimulus was applied. Fig. 2 
shows there were more activations in the 
visual cortex.

 To avoid confounding effect of inflow, 
it was necessary to make sure the in-flow 
effect was excluded. Fig. 3 shows much 
more activation volumes from VASO signal 
change than those induced by inflow-effect.

FWHM, onset time and maximum 
BOLD signal change measured from the 
breath hold conditions in BOLD sequence 
with durations of 5s, 10 s, 15 s, 20 s and 30 
s are shown in Table below.  
 
 
 
 
Their correlations are illustrated in Fig. 
5. Among the three measurements, FWHM 
correlated strongly with breath hold 
duration (r2=0.909, Fig. 4(a)), indicating 
that temporal BOLD responses were tightly

One of the major findings in this 
normal group study was that significant 
BOLD responses could be detected in the 
gray matter for a breath hold duration as 
short as 5 seconds, and significant VASO 
response for a breath-hold duration of 15 
seconds. Since higher magnetic field is able 
to provide higher SNR and better detect 
ability, it is expected that the BOLD and 
VASO signal changes induced by repeated 
breath-holds of different durations (5, 10, 15, 
20, 30 sec) would be more intense on a 3-T 
scanner than a 1.5-T scanner. Compared 
with results based on a 1.5 T study (5), the 
BOLD signal increases ranged between 1% 
and 2%, where the present 3-T study 
showed maximal signal increases between 
1% and 2.6%.

er BOLD and VASO signal changes 
induced by repeated breath-holds on the 3-T 
scanner than on a 1.5-T scanner, about a 
30% more changes in the signal. Higher 
magnetic field has the advantage to provide 
higher SNR and better detectability of 
signal changes during clinical 
cerebrovascular studies., 
There were concord
ases and VASO signal decreases in 
gray matter and no corresponding signal 
changes in all the brain tumors, regardless 
of the pathologic diagnosis. Lack of VASO 
signal decreases and BOLD signal increases 
during breath holding in the hypoperfusion 
areas of tumors was most likely resulted 
from reduced local hematocrit due to 
decreased perfusion (32), or absence or 
inadequacy of normal vasculature 
responsible for vasodilatation in 
hypercellular hypovascular regions. 
On the other hand, absen
th-hold regulated VASO and BOLD 
signal changes in hyperperfused tumor 
regions is a more complicated phenomenon. 
Vasodilatation secondary to hypercapnia 
stress is not expected to occur in the newly 
developed abnormal vasculature because 
there is no normal vascular architecture with 
smooth muscle by which the effects of 
elevated arterial CO2 are mediated (33). In 
regions where there are coexisting normal 
and abnormal vasculature, undetectability of 
BOLD signal increase is most likely 
resulted from the overwhelming 
hypo-oxygenation status of the tumor (34).  
    Interestingly, breath-hold regulated 2.
VASO signal increases and BOLD signal 
decreases were noted two of the 
meningiomas, but not in any other tumors. 
Our previous study showed that there were 
decreases in BOLD signals during breath 
holding in a high-grade glioma (with 
neovasculature), but not in the low-grade 
gliomas (35). Meningiomas arise from 
arachnoid villi in the meninges, and 
typically have tumor center and dural bases 
supplied by meningeal arteries and the 
peripheral portion supplied by cerebral 
arteries (36). The dense vasculature with 
large vessel size in meningiomas can be 
demonstrated in a cerebral angiogram (36). 
Under hypercapnia stress, blood from a 
region of the tumor in which the vessels do 
not dilate is redistributed to a responsive 
tumor region and surrounding normal tissue, 
causing a focal worsening of tumor 
perfusion (2). The so-called steal 
phenomenon is expected to be exaggerated 
in a tumor region where cellularity is high 
(more oxygenation demanding) and 
neovascularity is present (less CO2-induced 
vasodilatation). 
This prelim
O and BOLD 3-T MRI during repeated 
short breath holdings possess the potential 
for providing cerebrovascular information 
helpful to differentiate between normal and 
abnormal bran tissues, and between 
different brain pathologies. However, the 
number of patients of this study was small 
and the pathologies were various, further 
large-cohort studies with histopathological 
correlation are necessary to solidify these 
issues.
