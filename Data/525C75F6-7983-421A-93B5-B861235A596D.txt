enhanced the performance of SBG&DD in MFCs.  
Gradually increased supplementations of C.I. reactive 
blue 160 resulted in progressively decreased decay 
rates of bioelectricity generation.  In addition, a 
reduced dye with less toxicity potency (e.g., 2-
aminophenol, 2AP) acted as a mediator for electron 
transfer to anodic biofilm for bioelectricity 
generation in MFCs.  The ranking of isomeric 
aminophenols for electron mediators in MFCs could 
then be shown as 2AP > 3AP > 4AP.  Compared to other 
MFCs, Aeromonas or Klebsiella sp. seeding mixed 
culture MFC had better performance of SBG&DD.  Cyclic 
voltammograms (CV) results also indicated that 
supplementation of RBu160 significantly augmented 
current production in MFC.  
This study also used indigenous pollutant degrading 
bacteria to produce biodegradable polymers 
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) during wastewater 
treatment. Candidate strains of poly-3-
hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production were inspected among 
isolated pollutant-degrading microbes via Sudan black 
B staining (SB staining). Next, according to batch 
cultures using lauric acid (C12) as the sole carbon 
source for PHB production, the promising PHB-
generating strains were obtained via comparative 
analysis upon the characteristics of cell growth 
and/or PHB production. Our findings indicated that 
Aeromonas hydrophila NIU01 cultured at 10 g L-1 
lauric acid-supplemented medium could generate 
intracellular PHB content at ca. 36.02 wt%. At 
optimal concentration of lauric acid, cultures 
containing dyes or amines at different concentrations 
were conducted to simulate of microbial production 
PHB in parallel with dye decolorization. Here, our 
finding indicated that strains NIU01 could 
significantly tolerate dye pollutant(s) and aromatic 
amines for cell growth and PHB-production, suggesting 
promising feasibility to be used for simultaneous PHB 
production and wastewater decolorization.  This study 
also showed the feasibility of PHA production in the 
presence of dyes and decolorized intermediates and 
explored the feasibility of simultaneous dye-bearing

Abstract 
This first-attempt study quantitatively explored interactive characteristics of 
simultaneous bioelectricity generation and dye decolorization (SBG&DD) in 
air-cathode single-chamber microbial fuel cells (SC-MFCs) using indigenous bacteria. 
Appropriate acclimation strategy to generate the electrochemically active anodic 
biofilm significantly enhanced the performance of SBG&DD in MFCs.  Gradually 
increased supplementations of C.I. reactive blue 160 resulted in progressively 
decreased decay rates of bioelectricity generation.  In addition, a reduced dye with 
less toxicity potency (e.g., 2-aminophenol, 2AP) acted as a mediator for electron 
transfer to anodic biofilm for bioelectricity generation in MFCs.  The ranking of 
isomeric aminophenols for electron mediators in MFCs could then be shown as 2AP > 
3AP > 4AP.  Compared to other MFCs, Aeromonas or Klebsiella sp. seeding mixed 
culture MFC had better performance of SBG&DD.  Cyclic voltammograms (CV) 
results also indicated that supplementation of RBu160 significantly augmented current 
production in MFC.  
This study also used indigenous pollutant degrading bacteria to produce 
biodegradable polymers polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) during wastewater treatment. 
Candidate strains of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production were inspected among 
isolated pollutant-degrading microbes via Sudan black B staining (SB staining). Next, 
according to batch cultures using lauric acid (C12) as the sole carbon source for PHB 
production, the promising PHB-generating strains were obtained via comparative 
analysis upon the characteristics of cell growth and/or PHB production. Our findings 
indicated that Aeromonas hydrophila NIU01 cultured at 10 g L-1 lauric 
acid-supplemented medium could generate intracellular PHB content at ca. 36.02 wt%. 
At optimal concentration of lauric acid, cultures containing dyes or amines at different 
concentrations were conducted to simulate of microbial production PHB in parallel 
with dye decolorization. Here, our finding indicated that strains NIU01 could 
significantly tolerate dye pollutant(s) and aromatic amines for cell growth and 
PHB-production, suggesting promising feasibility to be used for simultaneous PHB 
production and wastewater decolorization.  This study also showed the feasibility of 
PHA production in the presence of dyes and decolorized intermediates and explored 
the feasibility of simultaneous dye-bearing wastewater treatment and production of 
biodegradable polymer PHAs.

Abstract 
This study unveiled a new strategy to explore new indigenous strains with excellent 
decolorization capabilities from freshwaters and seawaters. Two new bacterial 
decolorizers DX2b and SH7b, which have the capability to decolorize textile dyes, 
were isolated from Cross-Strait Taiwan and China. According to PCR-augmented 16S 
rRNA gene analyses for strain identification, >99% of nucleotide sequences in 
isolated strains were identical to type strains Rahnella aquatilis, Acinetobacter 
guillouiae, Microvirgula aerodenitrificans, and Pseudomonas sp. Time-series 
inspection upon azoreductase activity assay and generation of decolorized 
intermediates all confirmed in parallel with reductive decolorization of new 
decolorizers DX2b and SH7b. The result also showed that bacterial decolorization of 
these new strains wasmainly catalyzed via the enzymatic expression of azoreductase 
and riboflavin reductase, and biosorption seemed not to play a crucial role color 
removal (approximately b10%).

cells in MFCs. In addition, this study first quantitatively revealed
dose–response analysis based upon bioelectricity-generating and
dye-decolorizing capabilities to determine inhibitory potency of
reactive blue 160 to cells on anodic biofilm in MFCs. A typical dose–
response curve includes four parameters: the threshold (baseline
dose; EC0), the maximum treatment concentration (top dose; EC100),
the slope of response curve and the concentration to provoke a 50%
response (median effective dose; EC50). The EC0 and EC100 can be
defined as the maximum concentration to have a detectable
response (i.e., 0+%) and minimum concentration to have 100%
response, respectively. In addition, EC0, EC20, and EC50 are tabulated
herein to produce an obvious diagram of toxicity series in terms of
response-curve of various indicator variables (IVs). For example, if
values of effective concentrations (e.g., EC20, EC50) for IVA are much
less than those for IVB, IVA is more vulnerable than IVB. Aware that
only interpolated values of EC (e.g., EC0, EC20, EC50) were chosen for
toxicity comparison in this study, since EC100 is usually over the
solubility limit of test chemical. This study also proposed that
cellular respirometric activity was strongly associated to bioelectricity-
generating capability of bacterial cells inMFCs. Evidently, augmentation
of exogenous mediator(s) with low toxicity potency (e.g., 2AP) was
electrochemically effective to enhance bioelectricity-generating
capability of SBP&CR. Theseoperationguidelines providedprofessionals
promising criteria to examine the feasibility of MFCs before they launch
for practical applications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MFC construction and microbial cultures Membrane-free air cathode single-
chamber MFCs were constructed as describe elsewhere (7). Proteus hauseri ZMd44
predominantly isolated from nature under selection pressures of reactive blue 160
(RBu160) and direct orange 39 (DO39) and identified via 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree
analysis was used for study (9). The procedures of bacterial cultures for acclimatization
and experiments were described elsewhere (8,10).
Electrochemical measurements Cyclic voltammetry of aminophenol isomers
was performed using an electrochemical workstation (Jiehan 5600, Taiwan) at
10 mV s−1 scan rate (4). The working, counter, and reference electrodes were,
respectively, a glassy carbon electrode (0.07 cm2), platinum electrode (6.08 cm2), and
a Hg/Hg2Cl2 electrode filled with saturated KCl(aq). The glassy carbon electrode (GCE,
ID=3 mm; model CHI104, CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA) was successively
polished with 0.05 μm alumina polish and then rinsed with 0.5 M H2SO4 and deionized
water before use. The experiments were performed in phosphate buffer solutions
(pH=7.0) at 0.1 M and the solutions were purged with nitrogen for 15 min prior to
analysis. The scanning rate was 10 mV s−1 over the range from 0.4 to−0.6 V. The redox
potentials recorded as Hg/Hg2Cl2 reference electrode were corrected by 0.241 V (i.e., E0
of Hg/Hg2Cl2) to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
Biotoxicity assessment A modification of dose–response analysis for toxicity
evaluation was specifically conducted as described elsewhere (11). The ratio VCC/VCC0
of 0 and 1 simply indicated complete inhibition and insignificant inhibitory toxicity to
strain ZMd44, respectively (VCC0 denoted viable cell count for dye-free cultures). The
unity of this ratio simply implied that the toxicity of RBu160 at this concentration was
nearly negligible to strain ZMd44. Probit analysis (11) was adopted to reveal dose
response curves of RBu160-containing solutions. Semilogarithmic plot of dye
concentration versus the provoked response is assumed to reveal a linear relation via
probit transformation as follows:
Y ¼ Aþ B logC ð1Þ

where A and B denote the intercept and Hill slope of dose–response relation, C and Y
are the concentration of RBu160 (mg L−1) and probit unit, respectively; P is
the response (%) corresponding to administered amine, erf(x) is an error function.
The response variable P1−P5 can be termed as 1−VCC/VCC0, 1− k/k0, 1−V/V0,
1− V / V 0, or 1− IDR0/IDRwith the basic properties of 100%=P|C³MEC>P|THbCbMEC>
P|C£TH=0, where decay rate constant k (d−1) was defined via the first order decay

MEC and TH in subscripts denoted the smallest concentration to havemaximal effect (i.e.,
100% response) and the largest threshold concentration to have no effect of toxicity (i.e.,
0% response), respectively.
Inhibition inspection via respirometry Toxicity effects of aminophenol
isomers on cellular respiratory activity associated to microbial growth of cell cultures
were tested individually using automated Columbus Micro-Oxymax Respirometer
equipped with CO2 sensors. The measurement relied on the circulation of air through
closed-system testing bottles whereas the liquid in bottles remain static (i.e., mobile
liquid-flowing gas respirometer) (12). As cumulative amount of CO2 present in blank
bottle was nearly negligible (approximately b 1–2 mg) for 5 day testing, different time
courses of CO2 production were simply due to the absence or presence of existing
toxicants in cultures. For respirometric experiments, a loopful of P. hauseri ZMd44 seed
taken from an isolated colony on an LB-streak plate was precultured in 50-mL Bacto LB
culture, Miller (Luria–Bertani) (per liter; 10 g Bacto tryptone, 5 g Bacto yeast extract,
10 g sodium chloride) for 12 h (late exponential growth phase) at 30°C, 125 rpm using
a water bath shaker (SHINKWANG, SKW-12). Then, 0.5 mL precultured broth was
inoculated into 250 mL bottles containing fresh 0.2× LB broth and test aminophenol
isomers at different concentrations for respirometric experiments at 30°C, 110 rpm.
The calibration of respirometer was conducted by using standard CO2(g) at 0.5% prior to
respirometric experiments.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effects of exogenous mediator on bioelectricity production
and reductive decolorization As indicated in Chen et al. (8),
supplementation of 2-aminophenol (2AP) significantly enhanced
bioelectricity-generating and dye-decolorizing performance of P.
hauseri in MFC. Plus, the output voltage and voltage decay rate
constant gradually increased with successively increased concentra-
tion of 2AP. In contrast, supplementation of 3AP tended to decrease
the capabilities of power production in MFC. Surprisingly, supple-
mentation of 4-aminophenol (4AP) to MFC completely suppressed
bioelectricity-generating capabilities of P. hauseri ZMd44. As a matter
of fact, the isomeric 4AP is known as an electrochemically active
compound and the redox reaction of 4AP is a two-proton coupled
two-electron process as the electrooxidation mechanism shown in
Fig. S1 (13). However, why and how could only supplementation of
4AP completely repress power generation of P. hauseri ZMd44 (8)? To
clarify mysteries behind aforementioned findings, cyclic voltammo-
grams (CVs) of three isomeric amines 2AP (ortho), 3AP (meta) and
4AP (para) (11) in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0 were conducted for comparison.
The repetitive CVs of 2AP and 4AP nearly exhibited quasi-reversibility
of redox processes for a larger separation in peak potentials compared
to slightly irreversible processes of 3AP (Fig. 1). For quasi-reversible
systems, the current is controlled by both the charge transfer and
mass transport (14,15). Watanabe et al. (14) also mentioned that “the
ability of electron shuttles (ESs) (e.g., 2- and 4-aminophenol) both to
be reduced by microbes and to deliver electrons to organics (to be
degraded) is also dependent on the gross structure and functional
chemical moieties of the compounds (e.g., phenazine)”. Thus, this
quasi-reversibility disclosed similar sized peaks for the forward and
reverse scan, indicating why 2AP could play as an ES to significantly
enhance bioelectricity-generating efficiency of MFC. The oxidation
peak potential (Eox) and reduction peak potential (Ered) of 2AP and
4AP were approximately −0.281, 0.391 V (vs. SCE) and 0.100,
0.0294 V (vs. SCE), respectively (Fig. 1). In fact, the electron-shuttling
capability of 2AP as an electron mediator might be suggested by
the reversible redox transformation involving o-aminophenol and
o-quinonimine as shown in Fig. S2 (16). Due to quasi-reversible
reactivity of 2AP and 4AP, they should rapidly transform between the
reduced and oxidized state, mediating efficient electron transfer in
MFCs. This could elucidate why increased dosage of 2AP to MFC could
gradually augment power output in MFC (8). As a matter of fact, Song
(17) mentioned that 4AP was also an electrochemically active
MICROBIAL FUEL CELL USING P. HAUSERI 503VOL. 113, 2012
bioelectricity-generating activity of P. hauseri. However, whether
toxicity figures of RBu160 could affect such a bioelectricity-generating
activity still remained open for discussion. Of course, lack of adequate
toxicity assessment on RBu160 makes the MFC unreliable for practical
uses. To provide more clear profiles of toxicity response of RBu160,
dose–response analysis upon time courses of SBP&CR for anodic biofilm
(8) and viable cell count (VCC) for suspended cells of P. hauseri was
conducted in terms of VCC, decay rate constant k, maximal output
voltageV, average output voltage V and initial decolorization rate (IDR)
(Fig. 4). The ranking of critical toxicity characteristics (e.g., EC0, EC20,
EC50, Hill slope B; effective concentration at x% denoted ECx) based
on the response variables of these parameters (i.e., P1–P5; Table 2)were
shown as follows: (i) EC0 (unit in mg L−1): P5(5.185)bP4(23.82)b
P1(25.31)bP3(109.9)bP2(394.3), (ii) EC20 (unit inmg L−1): P5(67.69)b
P1(102.3)bP3(529.2)bP4(624.0)bP2(836.6), (iii) EC50 (unit in
mg L−1): P1(217.0)bP5(269.9)bP3(1233)bP2(1252)bP4(3621), (iv)
Hill slope B (−): 1bP4(1.100)bP5(1.398)bP3(2.286)bP1(2.572)b
P2(4.783). Apparently, the rankings of all EC values clearly revealed
that viable cell count (P1) and initial decolorization rate (IDR; P5)
used as toxicity measures were more vulnerable than others, since
they were more toxic at lower doses (e.g., EC50: P2–P4 (1233–
3621 mg L−1)>>P1, P5 (217–270 mgL−1)). Regarding P1, immobilized
cells on anodic film in MFCs could express a higher toxicity tolerance to
RBu160 than suspended cells (i.e., larger EC values of P2–P4 than that of
P1) likelydue to successful biofilm formationof immobilized cells during
1 month acclimatization to stably maintain cell viability in RBu160-
bearing MFCs. Plus, bioelectricity-generating and dye-decolorizing
capabilities of P. hauseri in MFCs were competitive to each other (8).
As most of electron transfer capacity inMFCs was used for bioelectricity
generating, less electrons could be provided for reductive decoloriza-
tion, leading to more sensitive potency of toxicity upon IDR (P5) of dye
RBu160. RegardingHill slope B, the largest value of P2 (4.783) suggested
the smallest range of tolerance fromEC0 to EC100 and the steepest dose–
response curve for the toxicity of RBu160. That is, once dye toxicity
started to affect bioelectricity-generating capability in MFCs,
electron-transfer potential of electrochemically active cells in
MFCs might irreversibly attenuate as there would be only a small
difference between a dose producing no effect (EC0=394 mg L−1)
and a dose producing serious outcome(s) (i.e., a significant loss of
capability for bioelectricity generation). All of the analyses suggested
that understanding toxicity potency of pollutant(s) to immobilized
cells in MFCs was a prerequisite to maximize the efficiency of
bioelectricity generation inMFC. In contrast, the smallest value of Hill
slope B for P4 (1.10) directly implied the widest range of tolerance to
toxicity of RBu160 from EC0 to EC100 likely due to the less sensitive
characteristics of average output voltage to dye toxicity. This might
be caused by endogenous metabolism for cellular survival (19). In
summary, as indicated in EC values for P2 and P3, the feasible
concentration of dye RBu160 to maintain stable bioelectrochemical
activity for SBP&CR in the absence of exogenous mediators provided
should be below approximately 529–837 mg L−1 (i.e., b EC20) as
shown in Chen et al. (7). This also confirmed that toxicity potency
of pollutant(s) to electrochemically active microbes (or exoelec-
trogenic organisms) controlled the efficiency of bioelectricity
generation during SBP&CR.
Significance of the study Dye toxicity to bioelectricity-
generating bacteria in MFCs directly affected the performance of
simultaneous bioelectricity generation and reductive decolorization.
Bioelectricity-generating capability became more dominant on
electron-transfer capacity in MFCs with gradually-increased dye
concentrations. Due to significant biotoxicity of 4AP and the absence
of electron-mediating potential of 3AP, only 2AP could play an
exogenous mediator to simulate bioelectricity generation in MFCs
among all isomers.

(λmax=476 nm) was selected for quantitative comparison upon decolorization of
bacterial isolates. The dye and cell concentrations were determined as described
elsewhere (4). The growth and decolorization performance could be calculated by specific
growth rate (SGR) μ, and specific decolorization rate (SDR) qP (7) as follows (4):
SGR ¼ μ ¼ d lnX=dt 1=Xð Þ X=tð Þ ð1Þ

respectively; where X, [Dye], and t were cell concentration, dye concentration, and time,
respectively.
Screening protocol for decolorizers Freshwater or seawater samples obtained
from 19 sites in Cross-Strait—Taiwan and China (i.e., freshwater samples: Alancheng-
Xiyigou (AX), Alancheng-Youyongcheng (AY), Baoshi-Shan quanshui (BS), Datong-Xiao
miji (DX), Jiu-Liao xishui (JL), Jing-Yidaxue xingzhenglou (JY), Lan-Hua xi (LH), Si-Makusi
(SM), Song-Huajiang (SH), Tou-Cheng nongchang (TC), Wu-Shi xi (WS), Xi-Men guojia
kuaiji xueyuan (XM); seawater samples: Bo-Hai (BH), Bei-Gan ginbicun (BG), California
(CA), Lv-Dao (LD), Mission Bay (MB), Zhuang-Wei (ZW), Qi-Gu yanshui (QG); Table S1)
were used to isolate high-performance dye-decolorizing bacteria. Samples CA, MB were
obtained from Southern California as a cross-Pacific Ocean control for comparison.
Aqueous solutions of 10, 40 g L−1 NaCl were used for regular freshwater and seawater
sample LB cultures, respectively. The 60 g L−1 NaCl was used for cultures of QG samples
since this sample was originally selected from highly-salty environment in southern
Taiwan. First, 100 mL fresh samples were mixed with the fungicide nystatin 0.1 g L−1
(approximately 8200 units L−1) to remove fungi during isolation. Then, sampleswerewell
agitated in awater-bath shaker (SHINKWANG, SKW-12) at 125 rpm for 30 min to achieve
complete mixing. Then, 1.0 mL-mixed samples were inoculated in 5 mL LB broth
containing 200 mg L−1 RBu198 or RBu19 for 24 h preculture. LB broth (Luria–Bertani)
(in g L−1) contained casein peptone 10.0, yeast extract 5.0, sodium chloride 10.0 and
200 mg L−1 test non-azo dye (i.e., RBu198 or RBu19). After 24 h preculture, static
incubation for color removal was carried out and decolorization capability of mixed
cultures was evaluated over time. To obtain strains with board-spectrum decolorization
capabilities, only ranked top 4 mixed cultures (i.e., AX, DX, JL, SH) of decolorization
capabilities to both non-azo and azo dyes were selected for bacterial isolation afterwards.
Then, strain isolation on four mixed cultures AX, DX, JL and SHwas carried out via at least
three cycles of serial streak selections to ensure the purity of individual isolates from
microbial communities. These fourmixed cultureswere then isolated via three-step serial
purification as follows: (i) Approximately >5 colonies in different radii, color or
morphology from each mixed culture were taken for at least three cycles of colony
purification and isolation; (ii) approximately 200 colonies obtained 3-serial isolationwere
taken as seeds in 5.0 mL test-tube vial cultures to quantify their decolorization capabilities
ofRBu198andRBu19; (iii) sinceonlyRBu198 could bedecolorizedbymost ofpure isolates
and RBu19 was totally not decolorized by pure isolates, 19 colonies with top-rank color
removal performance of RBu198were then selected for pre-screening strain identification
through comparison of protein expression profiles in SDS-PAGE.
Microorganism and culture conditions Decolorization performance of the
identified decolorizer isolates was carried out as follows: First, 1% (v/v) seed culture was
inoculated for 12 h preculture in 100-mL LB broth at 30°C, 125 rpm using a water-bath
shaker. Then, all precultured broths in appropriate volume ratios were inoculated into
fresh LB broth with 200 mg L−1 dye for color removal experiments. Once cells had been
grown to late exponential or early stationary phase (approximately 12 and 24 h for pure
and mixed cultures, respectively), shaking was switched off and the culture was kept in
static incubation for decolorization (i.e., ∀t≥0). Then, time courses of decolorization at
various initial dye concentrations were determined.
Morphological and biochemical test Morphological examinationwas observed
by a light microscope (Zeiss Axioskop). BD Gram stain kits and reagents (Becton,
Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the Ryu non-staining KOHmethod
(15) were used to ascertain the Gram reaction. Biochemical identification presented in
the Microgen ID microtests was determined by Microgen ID software Version 1.1.16.19
according to as recommended by the manufacturer (Microgen Bioproducts, UK).
16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis Amplification and
sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA geneswas performed as described previously (16). The
sequence was compared with others available in GenBank. The multiple-sequence
alignment including closest relatives of isolates was performed using the BioEdit program
(17). The phylogenetic reconstructionwas inferred by using the neighbor-joiningmethod
in the BioEdit software. A bootstrap analysis (confidence values estimated from 1000
replications of each sequence) was performed for the neighbor-joining analysis using the
CLUSTAL W 1.7 program (18). A phylogenetic tree was drawn using the TREEVIEW
program (19). Sequence identities were calculated using the BioEdit program.
Assay for azoreductase activity Bacterial cultures sampledat various timeofdye
decolorization were taken for azoreductase activity assay. According to Maier et al. (20),
assays were carried out in cuvette (path length=1 cm) with total volume of 1 mL. First,
cultivated cells were separated by centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and supernatants
were removed. Next, precipitated cells were twice washed with sterile phosphate-buffer
saline (PBS0.05 M) solution to remove residual dye andmetabolites in cultures. Then, cells
concentrated in5 mLweremixedwith5 mL0.05 MPBS solution asmix-vials. Themix-vial
was well mixed with 8 μL 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μL chloroform, and 100 μL of 0.1% SDS
for 1 min as the reaction pre-mix. This pre-mix was precipitated via centrifuge at
13,000 rpm, 4°C. Next, 200 μL supernatant was degassed with nitrogen purge and mixed
with 400 μL 0.05 M PBS solution, 200 μL reactive black 5 (RB5) 100 mg L−1, 200 μL
degassed NADH (7.09 g L−1) as reactionmix. Then, time course of dye decolorizationwas
carried out for azoreductase activity assay using cell-free cases as zero control. The assay
reactionwas initiated by the addition of 200 μLNADHandwasmonitoredphotometrically
at 597 nm (20). The slope of initial linear decrease of absorption (ΔAmin−1) was used to
calculate azoreductase activity based on the molar absorption coefficient of RB5
(ε=35.5 mmol−1 cm−1). One nanokatal was defined as 1 nmol dye-reduced s−1.
Assay for laccase and reductase enzymes All the enzymatic activities were
assayed bya spectrophotometer (SpectraMaxM5,MolecularDevices, Sunnyvale, CA,USA)
at kinetic mode and 37°C for the intra-celllular proteins inwhich cells werewashed twice
with deionized water and disrupted via sonication. The cell debris was then removed by
centrifugation at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatant was collected.
The activity of laccase was determined in a reaction mixture with ABTS [2,2-azinobis(3--
ethylbenzathiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] as the substrate. The 205 μL reaction mixture
contained 100 μL of 1 mM ABTS, 100 μL of 50 mM citric acid buffer (pH 3.0), and 5 μL of
enzyme solution. The enzymatic activity wasmonitored kinetically via an increase in A420
using ABTS as the substrate. The riboflavin reductase was measured by the modified
method of Fontecave et al. (21). The reaction was performed using a solution (final
volume, 200 μL) containing 10 μL of 0.4 mMofNADH, 100 μL of 0.4 mM riboflavin, 80 μL of
sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7) and 10 μL intracellular enzyme. For NADH
reductase activity, the reaction was performed using a solution (final volume, 200 μL)
containing 100 μL of 0.4 mM of NADH, 90 μL of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7)
and 10 μL intracellular enzyme. The decrease in A340 was then measured spectrophoto-
metrically. Reaction rates were calculated by using a molar extinction coefficient of
36 mM/cm for ABTS and 6.22 mM/cm for NADH, respectively. One unit of enzyme activity
was defined as 1 μmol of substrate reduced or oxidized per minute. To ensure that the
finding was not taking place by chance, all enzyme assays were performed in triplicate.
Electrochemical measurements Cyclic voltammetry of azo dyeswas performed
using an electrochemical workstation (Jiehan 5600, Jiehan Company, Chiung, Taiwan) at
50 mV s−1 scan rate. The working, counter, and reference electrodes were, respectively, a
glassy carbon electrode (0.07 cm2), platinumwire electrode (10.8 cm2), and anHg/Hg2Cl2
electrode filled with saturated KCl. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE, ID=3mm; model
CHI104, CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA) was successively polished with 0.05 μm
alumina polish and then rinsedwith 1 MNaOH(for protein removal) and deionizedwater
before use. The experiments were performed in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at
dye concentration of 7.52 mM. Prior to analyses all solutions were purged with nitrogen
for 15 min. The redox potentials recorded vs. Hg/Hg2Cl2 reference electrode were
corrected by 0.241 V (i.e., E0 of Hg/Hg2Cl2) to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Decolorization of pure and mixed cultures As indicated in
Table S1, the ranking of decolorization performance of non-azo dyes for
mixed cultures was RBu198>RBu19>AB264. Regarding the lowest
color removal efficiency of AB264, cell precipitate of all samples after
high-speed centrifugation (approximately 12,000 rpm) showed in blue
color, which was more evident to indicate biosorption primarily as the
mechanism of “decolorization” of AB264. A similar example of
biosorption was also observed in the blue color of Desulfovibrio
desulfuricans biosorbed with Cu(II) ions and yellow color of Pseudomo-
nas luteola biosorbed with reactive acid yellow 72 (RAY) (22,23). As a
matter of fact, dyedecolorizationmight bemetabolism-associated, since
dye decolorization inevitably required combined interactions of
membrane-associated transport, internal compartmentalization of dye
into cytoplasm, catalysis of dye-decolorizing enzymes andmediation of
electron transport chain for functioning. As inadequate decolorization
was likely due to dye toxicity (23), intracellular bioaccumulation of
AB264 via biosorption was possibly due to cytotoxicity of AB264 to
bacterial cells. When dye decolorization by cells was insufficient, a
significant gradient in AB264 concentration would tend to enforce
diffusion of this dye into the bacterial cytoplasm for bioaccumulation
(i.e., dye storage instead of decolorization). To prevent “pseudo”-
decolorization of AB264, only dye RBu198 and RBu19 were selected as
indicator dyes for further isolation of decolorizers. Among all cultures, 4
top-ranked samples AX, DX, JL, SH in decolorization performance were
obtained as candidates for strain isolation (Table S1). However, pure

several scancycles, it revealed that electron transfer capability of the test
dye was possibly to be reversible if appropriate condition was provided
(i.e., as explained for reappearing blue color or reversible decolorization
for RBu198). Due to different reduction potentials of myriads of textile
dyes different strains would be isolated if different dyes with different
CV plots were used as the selection pressure for strain isolation.
Microbiological identification As known, if two prokaryotic
isolates are genotypically identical, the profiles of protein expression
shown in SDS-PAGE should be nearly the same (i.e., phenotypically
and/or proteomically identical) under the same culture conditions.
Thus, sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) on extracted proteins from cultured cells was used to
distinguishwhether isolated cells originally obtained from colonies on
agar-plates are phenotypically different or identical. SDS-PAGE pro-
files for protein translation revealed that most of 19 colonies with top-
rank decolorization capabilities (refer to the section for Screening
protocol for decolorizers) obtained from sites DX, SH, AX were similar
to each other and only 4 proteomically diverse groups were found
(data not shown). Thus, only four isolates (DX2b, Ax-9, SH7b, SH98)
selected from each candidate group were chosen to determine their
sequences of 16S rRNA gene for strain identification. Based on the
sequence identification of 16S rRNA gene with GenBank, the highest
similarity values of strain SH7b was obtained towards the type strain
ofM. aerodenitrificans Sgly2T (99.6% identity). In addition, strain Ax-9
was highly similar to type strain A. guillouiae ATCC 11171T (99.8%
identity). Strain DX2b was in 99.5% nucleotide identity towards type
strain R. aquatilis DSM 4594T (99.5% identity). Moreover, strain SH98
was very similar to type strains Pseudomonas extremaustralis CT14-ST
(99.9% identity) and Pseudomonas veronii CIP 104663T (99.8%),
respectively (Figs. 1A–D and Table S2) and should thus be
Pseudomonas sp. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first report
revealing the feasibility of dye-decolorizing characteristics of
M. aerodenitrificans (SH7b) and R. aquatilis (DX2b).
Isolated cultures As Hsueh and Chen (28,29) indicated that
changes in themolecular structures of synthetic dyes (e.g., the electron-
donating or withdrawing characteristics of substituents and their

NEW STRAINS OF DYE-DECOLORIZING BACTERIA 511VOL. 113, 2012
simple and contains only an azo bond (Table S3). Second fast dye was
RB160, as carboxyl and sulfo group (i.e., electron-withdrawing group) at
ortho and para to azo bond in RB160 significantly increased biodegrad-
ability of this azo bond. This inspection clearly disclosed that the isolates
DX2b, Ax-9, SH7b, and SH98 could perform reductive decolorization of
azo dyes even theywere originally isolatedbynon-azodyesRBu198and
RBu19. This also suggested that decolorization and/or transformation of
these dyes were likely associated to electron transport chain (e.g.,
cytochrome C, NADH) (32) in cells for color removal.
Regarding detailed comparison of color removal performance of dyes
(Fig. 3), dye decolorization of these 4 isolated strains reached a maximal
valuewhencell growthhadnearly stoppedat the stationaryphase. Except
for NIU01, specific growth rate (SGR) progressively decreased to
approximately zero and specific decolorization rate (SDR) gradually
increased. This point also indicated that color removal was not growth-
associated. However, once SDR reached a maximum value after static
incubation, color removal performancegradually decreased. This decrease
in decolorization might be due to a significant accumulation of inhibitory
intermediates (i.e., aromatic amines) (33) formed by cleavage of azo
bond(s). In addition, the exhaustion of essential nutrients (e.g., basic
growth factors and essential energy sources) and formation of inhibitory
products also limitedenergy supply forbacterial decolorization.According
to the maximal SDR (unit in mg L−1 ODU−1 h−1) of O I, the order of
decolorization capabilities of isolated strainswasR. aquatilisDX2b (47.25)
>Proteus hauseri ZMd44 (41.36)>Aeromonas hydrophila NIU01 (33.10)
>A. guillouiae Ax-9 (20.88)>Pseudomonas sp. SH98 (16.05)>M.
aerodenitrificans SH7b (14.5). Similar rankings were also found for
decolorization of azo dye RB160 (data not shown). Compared to
excellent decolorizers A. hydrophila NIU01 and P. hauseri ZMd44 (5),
R. aquatilis DX2b was more promising to decolorize model azo dye O I.
Plus, there are no reports in literature indicating color removal
capabilities of strains of Rahnella and Microvirgula genera as indicated
here. This study also proposed a new strategy to isolate new bacterial
strains of specific categories from sampled microbiota. In fact,
prior studies (4,5) used different approaches to isolate several
decolorizers from natural environment, and found that those
decolorizers were all γ-Proteobacteria. Here, exceptM. aerodenitrificans
(i.e., one of β-Proteobacteria) this study seemed to confirm this point.
Enzyme activity assay As known, decolorization of dyes might
be taking place via either biodegradation or adsorption (34). To uncover
biodegradation phenomena, UV–vis spectral scan of supernatants of
orange I before and after decolorization by new strains DX2b, SH7b and
control strain NIU01 (4) were conducted. As shown in Fig. S1, the
maximum absorbance wavelength in visible spectra shifted from
476 nm to approximately 260 nm over time, suggesting that the
conjugated structure of azo bond (i.e., primary chromophore) was
destroyed. In addition, the absorbance peak at UV spectra still remained
at the end of decolorization, implying that orange I was not completely
mineralized. Nonetheless, decolorized intermediateswere accumulated
in the culture (35). Regarding adsorption and decolorization for color
removal (Fig. 4) (22), in the cultures with addition of heat-killed cells
(or autoclaved cells at OD600=0.92–2.06), only approximately 1.80%,
2.95%, 1.20%, and 3.98% decolorization extents were found after 9 h
incubation for strain DX2b, SH7b, Ax-9 and SH98, respectively. Plus, this
negligible adsorption of dead cells was also confirmed by the absence of
pigmented cell pellets. Moreover, in the cultures with deionized water-
washed cells (i.e., resting cells at OD600=1.30–2.48), approximately
4.07%, 9.89%, 5.84% and 11.91% decolorization extents were found after
72 h incubation for strain DX2b, SH7b, Ax-9 and SH98, respectively. For
active cells (i.e., PBS-washed cells, OD600=1.24), only slightly colored
cell pellet of SH98 was found within 5 min, but negligible sorption was
found for other strains (Fig. 4). Note that PBS couldmaintain cell activity
due to less stress of salt concentration gradient upon cell membrane.
When deionized water was used for cell wash, bacterial cells would be
under the pressure of passive diffusion by salt concentration gradient
between intracellular and extracellular compartment. Here, since color
removal performancewas defined herein by specific decolorization rate
(SDR; an intensive differential property), this sorption-related decolor-
ization would not affect the ranking of color removal capabilities of
strains as indicated in prior section for isolated cultures. Thus, except for
SH98 biodecolorization of orange Iwas primarily due to biodegradation,
rather than cell adsorption.
To disclose themechanism for biodecolorization of newdecolorizers
DX2b andSH7b, laccase, riboflavin reductase, NADHdehydrogenase and
azoreductase enzyme activities were measured at 6 hours after static
incubation. As indicated in Table 1, bacterial strains screened from
decolorization of azo and non-azo dyes produced less level of laccase,
indicating that laccase were expressed in background levels. Literature
(36,37) revealed that unless strong promoter(s) or inducer(s) are
present, not many strains could effectively express laccase in significant
levels. That is, electron transfer for dye decolorization is possibly not
associated with laccase as the mediator enzyme. Cytoplasmic NADH
dehydrogenase or/and riboflavin reductase seemed to be candidate
enzyme(s) dealing with electron transfer for decolorization. The order
of riboflavin reductase activities was AX-9>DX2b>ZMd44>NIU01>
SH98>SH7b (Table 1). Interestingly, the azoreductase activity of strain
SH7b was approximately 2.3-fold higher than the enzyme activity of
NIU01 (Fig. 5). Since energy supply in cells for dye decolorizationwas
possibly at fixed level, the expression of riboflavin reductase and

1. Introduction
As known, chemically synthesized polymers (or plastics) have
been popularly used in daily life due to their physical and chemical
stabilities and cost-competitive practicability. However, these
non-biodegradable plastics accumulated in the ocean by seasons
and years, causing impacts threatened to the global environment.
Thus, biodegradable plastics synthesized from microorganisms
were being considered as one of most environmentally friendly
alternatives to resolve such problems although they were still not
cost-effective for mass production.
Among biodegradable polymers, polyhydroxyalkanotes
(PHAs) are known as energy-storage materials that accumulate
in bacteria (e.g., Ralstonia eutropha, Alcaligenes latus, Aeromonas
hydrophila, Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus spp.) under some
hostile conditions (e.g., insufﬁcient nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur
and/or oxygen or excessive carbon supply [1–3]). Due to the
excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility of PHAs, they
have attracted noteworthy interest for practical uses as an
alternative in place of petroleum-based plastics [4]. PHAs can be
classiﬁed by the number of carbon atoms in their monomers [5].
Among those, ‘‘short-chain length’’ PHAs (e.g., poly 3-hydro-
xybutyrate (PHB) and polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV)) contained
monomers of carbon numbers ranged 3–5. Conversely, carbon
numbers of monomers in medium chain-length PAHs are
approximately 6–16. As known, more than 140 kinds of PHAs
with diverse physical and chemical characteristics have been
identiﬁed, strongly indicating their promising practicability in
diverse daily uses. For example, when lauric acid was used as a
carbon source for PHA production, the medium-chain-length
copolymers with PHB as main compositions were generated [6–
9]. In addition, PHB owns signiﬁcant biocompatibility for
biomedical applications and is capable to be used as various
biomaterials [10]. Thus, this feasibility study intentionally chose
PHB as core screening characteristics to probe feasible ones from
pollutant-degrading bacteria. Meanwhile, in response to ‘‘cradle-
to-cradle (C2C)’’ design for Taiwan’s sustainable development,
recycling and reuses of energy and materials are ﬁrst considered
to protect this extremely resource-limited environment. To
consider biodegradable materials production and wastewater
treatment, this study tended to seek for microbial strains that can
be used for treatment-efﬁcient and waste-free applications (e.g., a
renewable biosystem for PHA generation in tandem with
wastewater treatment). As known, the lipophilic staining with
Sudan black B (SB staining) reportedly has high sensitivity in PHA
screening for probing PHA-producing microbes. With SB staining,
bacterial colonies accumulating PHAs could qualitatively exhibit

For eco-friendly recycling and reuses of biomaterials with sustainability, this feasibility study tended to
use indigenous pollutant degrading bacteria for the production of biodegradable polymers –
polyhydroxyalkanotes (PHAs) during wastewater treatment. First, feasible PHA-producing strains were
qualitatively screened among pollutant-degrading microbes via Sudan black B staining (SB staining).
Next, according to batch cultures using lauric acid as sole carbon source, the promising PHA-generating
strains were obtained via comparative analysis upon the characteristics of cell growth and poly 3-
hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production. Aeromonas hydrophila NIU01, YTl1, KB23 and A. salmonicida 741 were
found to generate intracellular PHA content at higher levels of 19.35, 24.48, 22.52%, respectively. Plus,
Klebsiella pneumoniae ZMd31, Pseudomonas plecoglossicida NIU-Y3 and Chromobacterium violaceum P1
produced lower PHA contents at 18.25, 5.37 and 4.17%, respectively.

analysis.
2.3. Analytical methods
The GC analysis (gas chromatography; SRI 8610C, USA: GC
Column-Zebron ZB-5 in length = 30 m, I.D. = 0.25 mm, ﬁlm thick-
ness = 0.25 mm with FID detector) was performed after methano-
lyzing the polymer in sulfuric acid and methanol [19]. Conditions
for GC detection in splitless mode were injection, detector and
oven temperature at 250, 300 and 75 8C, respectively. Initial
temperature was controlled at 75 8C holding 1 min at rate of 25 8C/
min and ﬁnal temperature at 200 8C holding 4 min at carrier ﬂow of
3 ml/min (retention times of PHB and internal standard were ca.
2.2 and 4.6 min, respectively). Internal standard benzoic acid was
used to measure PHB concentration by comparing PHB peaks [20].
The purity of the standard PHB that was purchased from Sigma Inc.
is deﬁned as 100%. Based upon this deﬁnition, the relative purity of
the puriﬁed PHB, as used in the GC analysis, was determined to be
ca. 95%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Probing PHA-accumulating strains
Optical microscopic observations upon pollutant-degrading
microorganisms (e.g., Aeromonas hydrophila NIU01, YTl1, KB23, A.
salmonicida 741, Acinetobacter johnsonii NIU-x72, Proteus hauseri
ZMd44, Enterobacter cancerogenus BYm30, Pseudomonas plecoglos-
sicida NIU-Y3, Klebsiella pneumoniae ZMd31 and Chromobacterium
violaceum P1; Table 1) after SB staining indicated that more
signiﬁcant black blue granules accumulated in strains of Aero-
monas and Klebsiella genera (Fig. 1), revealing that those were
likely feasible candidate microorganisms for PHA production.
Moreover, relatively lower level accumulations of PHA were found
for Pseudomonas sp. and Chromobacterium sp. In contrast,
signiﬁcant accumulation of PHA granules was not observed in
intracellular compartments of Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacter sp.
and Proteus sp., simply suggesting that these strains were unlikely
feasible PHA-producing microbes (Fig. 1).
3.2. PHB-composition analysis
After identifying PHA-producing bacteria via Sudan black B
staining, quantitative assessment upon PHA productivities of 24
pollutant-degrading microbes was also carried out using 5 g/L
lauric acid as the sole carbon source. The ﬁndings indicated that
strains of PHA-accumulating microbes were Aeromonas sp. NIU01,
KB23, YTl1 and 741, Pseudomonas sp. NIU-Y3, Klebsiella sp. ZMd31
and Chromobacterium sp. P1. The high PHB contents of strains
NIU01, KB23, YTl1, ZMd31 and 741 were obtained at ca. 19.35,
22.52, 24.48, 18.25 and 13.28 wt%, respectively.
Regarding carbon source for PHA production, literature
[6,8,9,16,17,21,22] mentioned that lauric acid was often used as
a sole carbon source for A. hydrophila. Using 15 g/L xylose as a sole
carbon source, K. pneumoniae could produce 3HB-based PHAs at
10.17 wt% [23]. Moreover, C. violaceum used valerate as sole carbon
source to generate 3HV-based PHAs in 70 wt% [24]. P. plecoglossi-
cida was found to utilize octanoate as carbon source to generate
PHA at 28% (3HHx (16.3 mol%) and 3HO (82.7 mol%) as major
monomers) [25]. These suggested that using lauric acid as a carbon
source seemed not to be technically feasible to probe strains other
than Aeromonas-genus bacteria for the production of PHAs in
particular for 3HB-based. Follow-up inspections to explore optimal
concentrations of most appropriate carbon source(s) for PHA-
generating microbes to accumulate appropriate compositions of
PHA will be conducted. In addition, detailed physical and chemical
characteristics of PHAs produced will also be inspected via various
analyses (e.g., DSC, TGA, SDS-NaClO and FTIR method) [3,26,27].
4. Conclusion
This study successfully conducted Sudan black B staining for
screening viable PHA-producing microbes among pollutant-
degrading microbes. Using lauric acid as sole carbon source to
isolate PHA-producing microbes, Aeromonas hydrophila was
apparently the most promising PHA-producing strain. Here,
PHA-generating bacteria selected from pollutant biodegraders
were dye decolorizers. Thus, follow-up studies will conduct the
PHA-generating capabilities of these bacteria in the presence of
dye(s) and decolorized intermediate(s). The growth association of

1. Introduction
Among biodegradable materials, polyhydroxyalkanotes (PHAs)
are energy-storage materials that accumulate in bacteria under
some hostile conditions (e.g., insufﬁcient nitrogen, phosphorus,
sulfur and/or oxygen or excessive carbon supply [1–3]). Due to the
excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility of PHAs, they have
attracted noteworthy interest for practical uses as an alternative in
place of petroleum-based plastics (e.g., ﬁne chemicals, plastics,
printing materials, biofuel [4]). Considering biodegradable materi-
als production and wastewater treatment for sustainable materials
recycling and reuses, this study seeks for microbial strains that are
used not only for treatment-efﬁcient, but essentially waste-free
applications (e.g., a renewable biomass system for simultaneous
PHA generation and wastewater decolorization). As polyesters,
PHAs could be synthesized by various microbes, such as Ralstonia
eutropha, Alcaligenes latus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas
putida and Bacillus spp. PHAs can be classiﬁed by the number of
carbon atoms in their monomers [5]. Among those, ‘‘short-chain
length’’ PHAs (e.g., poly 3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polyhy-
droxyvalerate (PHV)) contained monomers of carbon numbers
ranged 3–5. Conversely, carbon numbers of monomers in medium
chain-length PHAs are approx. 6–16. Here, PHB was intentionally
selected as a model biodegradable polymer for this feasibility
study since it was often used as controlled-release matrices in
agricultural applications. However, to explore diverse chain-length
PHAs for myriads of eco-friendly uses, promising PHA-accumulating
strains are needed to be explored before large-scale productions
launch globally.
To consider the feasibility, several indigenous pollutant-
degrading bacteria were used for preliminary testing (Table 1;
[6–10]). For survival to be ﬁttest, in fact microbes might conduct
multi-function capabilities for living in the global environment.
Chen et al. [6,7,11] and Zhang et al. [10] disclosed the feasibility of
simultaneous bioelectricity generation and dye decolorization for
renewable energy recovery during wastewater treatment using
indigenous dye-decolorizing bacteria (e.g., Proteus hauseri;
[11,12]). In addition, dye-biodecolorizer A. hydrophila [6] was also
reported to be a PHA-generating microbe [13], suggesting that
simultaneous PHA production during wastewater treatment for
biomaterials recycling might be technically plausible. Moreover,
literature also mentioned that Aeromonas-genus strains harvested
from different sites might still have diverse capabilities of PHA

comparing PHA production performance at various dye or amine-bearing conditions. Batch cultures
using lauric acid (C12) at various concentrations as sole carbon source were carried out to determine
optimal concentration for microbial growth and the production of poly 3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). At
optimal concentration of C12, cultures laden with dyes at different concentrations were conducted to
explore whether dye-bearing cultures could stimulate or inhibit capabilities of PHA production. In
addition, as aromatic amines were generated during reductive decolorization, effects of supplemented
amines on capabilities of PHA-production were also conducted to uncover whether PHA generation
during dye decolorization was attenuated. According to biostatistics, the ﬁnding indicated that strains
NIU01, YTl1, KB23 could signiﬁcantly tolerate dye pollutant(s) and aromatic amines for cell growth and
PHA-production, suggesting promising feasibility to be used for PHA production during wastewater

deﬁned as 100%; thus, GC analysis indicated that the relative purity

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effects of lauric acid on PHA production
Using 5 g/L lauric acid as a sole carbon source, PHA content of
the PHA-producing bacteria (i.e., A. hydrophila NIU01, YTl1, KB23, A.
salmonicida 741 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ZMd31) were ca. 19.35,
22.52, 24.48, 13.28 and 18.25%, respectively. To explore the
detailed ﬁgures of PHA-generating capabilities of these microbes,
comparative assessment upon performance of cell growth and PHA
production at various lauric acid concentrations was carried out.
For 10 g/L lauric acid the highest PHA contents of strains NIU01 and
KB23 were obtained at ca. 36.02% and 34.93%, respectively (Table
1). When lauric acid increased to 15 g/L, PHA contents decreased to
28.02% and 26.37%, respectively. In contrast, for A. salmonicida 741
PHA contents nearly remained identical at 10 and 15 g/L. Recently,
Wei et al. [5] found that the C/N ratio of nutrient source at 8/1
seemed to be optimal for PHA production of Cupriavidus
taiwanensis 184 (i.e., dry biomass weight, PHA content and
concentration of 4.15 g/L, 58.8% and 2.44 g/L, respectively). Carbon
source was sufﬁciently provided at the C/N ratio of 20/1, dry
biomass weight, PHA content and concentration decreased to
1.69 g/L, 52.77% and 0.89 g/L, respectively. At constant nitrogen
concentration, evidently signiﬁcant increases in carbon substrate
concentrations would repress the capabilities of microbial growth
and PHA generation. At 15 g/L lauric acid A. hydrophila YTl1
intracellularly expressed PHA to a level of ca. 40 wt%; however,
increases in lauric acid could not signiﬁcantly increase PHA
generation for strain ZMd31. That was why only four dye-
decolorizing Aeromonas-genus strains (i.e., strains NIU01, YTl1,
KB23 and 741) were used for feasibility assessment of possible
pollutant degradation and PHA production. In addition, consider-
ing cradle-to-cradle design for sustainable bioremediation only
indigenous microorganisms were considered for treatability
studies of simultaneous wastewater treatment and biodegradable
materials production. Moreover, this ﬁrst-attempt inspection
apparently showed that increases in carbon-source concentrations
could signiﬁcantly stimulate PHA-producing potential of these
model strains to 30–40 wt%. It suggested that the pollutant
degradation coupled with biomaterials production seemed to be
technically feasible for eco-friendly bioremediation.
3.2. Effects of supplementing RR141 and lauric acid
As indigenous PHA-producing microorganisms in this study
were dye decolorizers, whether augmentations of azo dye RR141
could stimulate or inhibit the PHA-generating capabilities of these
strains were of course crucial to consider the viability of
simultaneous PHA generation and dye decolorization. As indicated
in Table 2, increases of RR141 from 200 to 1000 mg/L would
slightly provoke biotoxicity response on microbial growth (i.e.,
biomass weight). Regarding PHA production, PHA-producing
performances (e.g., PHA contents) seemed to be stably maintained
and slightly decreased with increases in concentration of RR141
(e.g., strains NIU01, KB23, 741). Apparently, higher PHA contents
(ca. 31–35 wt%) of A. hydrophila NIU01, KB23 were shown, since
these strains were originally isolated through the selection
pressure of RR141 for acclimatization [6]. It explained why
supplementation of RR141 would not evidently affect their PHA-
generating capabilities (e.g., 32.19–34.54% (RR141-bearing) vs.
34.93–36.02% (RR141-absent)). Compared to strains YTl1 and 741
isolated from selection pressures of less toxic azo dyes (e.g.,
RBu160, OI, OII), strains NIU01 and KB23 seemed to have higher Ta

cell growth as well as PHA production. In fact, prior studies [20,21]
also conﬁrmed that dye-decolorizer NIU01 could express higher
resistance to toxicities of azo dye(s) and/or derived amine
intermediates. Moreover, at higher concentrations of dye and
amine (e.g., at 3800 mg/L RR141 and 1000 mg/L amines) NIU01 still
expressed higher bioactivity than P. luteola did. Recent ﬁndings
also revealed that strain NIU01 was a promising microorganism for
simultaneous bioelectricity-generation and dye-decolorization
(data not shown). These all suggested that a high resistance of
strain NIU01 in dye-bearing environment could efﬁciently
transcribe associated metabolically functioning capabilities (e.g.,
PHA-production, power generation) during wastewater decolori-
zation. That is, strain NIU01 might be more appropriate to be
adopted for materials and energy recycling and reuses during
practical dye-bearing wastewater treatment.
4. Conclusion
This study compared the expression proﬁles for microbial growth
and PHA production in response to cultures containing various
concentrations of lauric acid, dyes and aromatic amines. As indicated
in Z scores, A. hydrophila NIU01, KB23 and A. salmonicida 741 showed
the promising resistance to model dye pollutants and aromatic
amines. It suggested a technical feasibility to use these strains for
biomaterials regenerating during wastewater decolorization. Further
follow-up studies would explore the operation strategy and reactor
mode of operation for simultaneous PHA generation and wastewater
treatment (e.g., two-stage operation or fed-batch culture).
