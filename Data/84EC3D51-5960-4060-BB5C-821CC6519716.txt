in X-ray angiography and a solution in the second category must68
be sought.69
The second category assumes that the vessel has a certain geo-70
metrical shape and seeks to ﬁnd the parameters of the shape.71
Although we will not be able to visualize irregular shape caused by72
plaques using this assumption, the reconstruction can still help sur-73
geons visualize the 3-D geometry of the vessels and the irregularity74
is available in the original angiographic views. Therefore, the recon-75
struction can still be helpful. Again, limited by available data, the76
shape of a circle is the easiest choice because only three parameters77
(two for the coordinates of the center and one for the radius) need to78
be estimated [19–22].  For an elliptical model, there are ﬁve param-79
eters to be estimated: two for the coordinates of the center, two for80
the lengths of major and minor axes, and one for the rotation angle81
of the major axis. With only two views, we have only four known82
inputs (the two edges of the vessel in the two views) and they are83
not sufﬁcient to solve ﬁve unknowns. Therefore, to reconstruct an84
elliptical model, four approaches have been proposed. The ﬁrst was85
to use the X-ray attenuation proﬁle as additional information [23].86
The second was to use three projections [24,25].  The third was  to87
use least square method to solve the overestimation problem [9].88
The fourth was proposed by us [26,27] and it used the relationship89
between adjacent slices to facilitate the reconstruction. Since an90
ellipse can be represented either in parametric form or in algebraic91
form, we developed two algorithms by representing the ellipses92
in these two forms. In this paper, we showed that the accuracy of93
the estimation can be improved by an order or more through two94
enhancements. The ﬁrst enhancement was a new method to esti-95
mate the rotation angle of the major axis. The second enhancement96
was a new method to estimate the lengths of the major and minor97
axes.98
The organization of this paper is as follows. In the second sec-99
tion, we ﬁrst describe the two algorithms that we have previously100
developed. Then, we present the improvements we  have made to101
the two algorithms. In the third section, we show that the new algo-102
rithms reduce the estimation errors considerably in experiments.103
In the fourth section, we conclude.104
2. Methods105
For the ease of discussions, we use a coordinate system where106
x is from left to right, y is away from the viewer, and z is from bot-107
tom to top. The coordinate system is independent of the projection 108
angle. After rotating  angles to both left and right, two  projections 109
are taken as the stereoscopic images. 110
The basic assumption we  make is that blood vessels are tilting 111
circular tubes and the cross section of a vessel is an ellipse. Fur- 112
thermore, we  assume that the blood vessel is not tilting from the 113
z-axis for more than 45◦. When a vessel does not match this con- 114
straint, we  can rotate the coordinate system to make it satisfy this 115
assumption. 116
The goal of the algorithms is to reconstruct the ellipse from the 117
edges of the two  stereoscopic images as shown in Fig. 2. In the ﬁg- 118
ure, the y-axis is the height of the vessel and the x-axis is the location 119
of the edge of the vessels. We  use a graph-searching method [28] 120
to detect the edges of the vessels. The projection is ﬁrst processed 121
by Sobel operator [29]. The processed image is used as the weights 122
of the edges. The start and end points of the vessel edge are marked 123
by a human operator. From the start point to the end point, a path 124
that maximizes the sum of the weights is searched and taken as the 125
inputs to the reconstruction algorithm. 126
2.1. Previous reconstruction algorithms 127
The two lines of sight from the midpoints of the projected ves- 128
sel intersect at the center of the ellipse. Since the midpoint is the 129
average of the left and right edges, we can ﬁnd the intersection eas- 130
ily. To simplify the discussion, we  shift the origin of the coordinate 131
system to the center of the ellipse. 132
An ellipse centered at the origin can be expressed in parametric 133
form as: 134{
x = a cos() cos(t) − b sin() sin(t)
y = a sin() cos(t) + b cos() sin(t)
(1) 135
where a and b are the lengths of the major and the minor axes, 136
respectively,  is the rotation angle of the major axis, and t is the 137
independent variable in the range between 0 and 2. 138
The ellipse can also be expressed in algebraic form as [30]: 139
[x y]X−1

]

√

The angle between RS and RT is  = +  − | L |. Therefore, we have180

where LL and LR are the lengths of left and right projections, respec-183
tively.184
The remaining question is how to derive  . As shown in Fig. 5, the185
value of  is directly related to ˇ. The value  ˇ is corresponding to an186
angle on two concentric circles whose radii are a and b, respectively.187
From the ﬁgure, we can see that  can be calculated from  ˇ as:188
 = tan−1
(
b
a
tan(ˇ)
)
(11)189
Plugging  back into Eq. (10), a and b can be solved and all three190
unknowns are found.191
2.1.2. Algebraic Algorithm 192
For algebraic form, the solution is to ﬁnd the three unknown 193
parameters: A, B, and D. To accomplish this, we need to establish the 194
relationship between the projective vessel widths (LL and LR) and 195
matrix X. Let vector C be an orthonormal basis for the projection 196
plane. The relationship between the projection length L and the 197
matrix X is as follows [30]: 198
CT = [u v] (12) 199
Y = CTXC (13) 200
where Y is equal to (L/2)2 and L is the projective vessel width. The 201
easiest way to appreciate this result is to consider a circle where A 202
must be equal to D. For a circle, the value of Y must be the square 203
of the radius. 204
Plugging Eq. (2) into Eq. (13), we obtain the following relation- 205
ship: 206
Y = Au2 + 2Buv + Dv2 (14) 207
With the above equations, the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd B. 208
Since we  can rotate the coordinate system to make the two pro- 209
jections symmetric, the orthonormal vectors of the two  projection 210
plane is CTR = [u v] and CTL = [−u v]. From Eq. (14), we  can obtain 211
the following two equations: 212{
YR = Au2 + 2Buv + Dv2
YL = Au2 − 2Buv + Dv2
(15) 213
where YR = L2R/4 and YL = L2L /4. 214
From Eq. (15), we  can obtain the following two equations: 215
B = (YR − YL)
4uv
(16) 216
u2A + v2D = (YR + YL)
2
(17) 217
It is apparent that the value of B can be derived from Eq. (16). 218
To ﬁnd the values of A and D, we  need at least one more equation 219
to accompany Eq. (17). The additional constraint is imposed by the 220
relationship between the adjacent ellipses. As shown previously, 221
the rotation angle of an ellipse can be found through Eq. (4). If we 222
rotate the ellipse by , the ellipse can be described by the following 223
equation: 224
x′2
a2
+ y

operation and lead to another doubling of the variance. The error272
variances for both the numerator and denominator become 42.273
The division in Eq. (4) leads to the addition of the variances at the274
numerator and denominator and the error variance becomes 82.275
If we assume the error is small, the arctangent operator can be con-276
sidered as a linear operator. Thus, the output error variance is 82.277
Otherwise, the output error variance is larger than 82 because278
of the arctangent operator. On the other hand, the calculation of279
LL/LR is a much simpler operation which involves an addition at280
both the numerator and denominator and a division. These lead281
to an output error variance of 42. Therefore, the error variance282
is reduced by twofold. In addition to the above improvement, the283
new method estimates the rotation angle using only data from the284
current slice but the previous method needs to use both the current285
slice and the slice above it. Using only the current slice can relax286
the constraint imposed by the tilting circular tube assumption and287
prevent the error from the previous slice to affect the estimation.288
However, this effect is difﬁcult to analyze theoretically. As will be289
demonstrated in the experiments, the new method does provide290
much more accurate results than our previous method.291
2.3. Improvement on the derivation of the lengths of major and292
minor axes293
When considers Eq. (10), we note that  can be either positive or294
negative. In fact, Eq. (10) is only accurate in the range of [, /2 − ].295
Therefore, the absolute value operation should be removed from 296
the equation and Eq. (10) is modiﬁed as follows: 297⎧⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
a2 cos2(ˇL) + b2 sin2(ˇL) =
L2L
4 cos2( +  + L)
a2 cos2(ˇR) + b2 sin2(ˇR) =
L2R
4 cos2( −  + R)
(21) 298
In the meantime, Eq. (20) needs to be modiﬁed as: 299
cos2(ˇL) + (b2/a2) sin2(ˇL)
cos2(ˇR) + (b2/a2) sin2(ˇR)
= L
2
L cos
2( −  + R)
L2R cos
2( +  + L)
(22) 300
With this minor enhancement, the accuracy of the estimate is 301
also greatly improved. 302
3. Experimental results 303
We  compared our method with the reconstruction method 304
using three views [24,25]. The three-view reconstruction is a good 305
benchmark to be measured against because it does not require any 306
assumption in reconstruction but at the cost of acquiring an addi- 307
tional view. To verify the accuracy of our algorithms, we did three 308
sets of experiments. The ﬁrst was  a simulation without additive 309
noise. This experiment showed that our new algorithms can accu- 310
rately reconstruct the vessels under a wide range of conditions.

3.3. Reconstruction with real data363
Finally, we used a 3-D MRA  data set to test our algorithms. The364
images showed the renal blood vessels of a patient. Complete 3-D365
data were acquired as a reference for stereoscopic reconstruction.366
They were obtained by stacking slices together on a 1.5T MRI scan-367
ner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). The scanning368
parameters were ﬁeld-of-view: 40 × 40 (cm), resolution: 256 × 256369
(pixels), slice thickness: 8 (mm),  and total number of slices: 50.370
The x–z plane was on the imaging plane and the y axis was along371
the direction where slices were stacked. After acquiring the com-372
plete 3-D dataset, two projections were then obtained along the y373
direction by rotating 15◦ left and right.374
The cross-sections of the actual vessel and the reconstructed375
ellipses were shown in Fig. 11.  We  could see that the estimated376
ellipses were very close to the boundaries of the vessel. Since the377
difference between the four algorithms was less one pixel, it was378
difﬁcult to see the difference in the cross sectional image because379
of the image resolution limit.380
To further compare the algorithms, the reconstructed vessel was381
projected back to the original projection planes and compared to382
the input edges. The edges between the reconstructed vessel and383
the input were subtracted. The sum of the absolute differences was384
averaged over all heights and used as the overall average error.385
The standard deviation of the differences was also calculated. The386

results were shown in Table 1. From the table, we  could see that 387
the best algorithm among our four algorithms was  the new algo- 388
rithm A and its performance was comparable to the three-view 389
reconstruction. 390
3.4. Discussion 391
These experimental results show that when vessel radius is 392
greater than or equal to three pixels, new algorithm A performs 393
comparably with three-view reconstruction in noiseless environ- 394
ment and it is more robust than three-view reconstruction when 395
noise is present. This is encouraging because the time needed to 396
acquire a third view can be saved and comparable results can be 397
achieved. However, when the vessel radius is less than three pixels, 398
