所述: 
(1)Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu中添加不同濃度的Ni 
    圖 1 為 Sn2.5Ag0.8CuXNi

5、10 次迴銲，界面型態類似，介金屬
形狀呈微島嶼狀，僅介金屬生長厚度
不一樣，因此以 1 次迴銲代表見圖
1(a)-(c)。至於介金屬型態為什麼呈現
微島嶼狀，推測是因為加入 Ni 於銲料
中會降低 Sn 對 Cu 的溶解度，介金屬
快速析出所造成，加入愈多 Ni 於銲料
中，銲錫球對 Cu 的溶解度愈低，所析
出的介金屬愈多。 
    在固固反應中，於 160 oC 下進行
500、1000，以及 2000 小時老化，界
面型態類似，僅介金屬生長厚度不一

明顯看出有兩層介金屬層，經 EPMA

為 Cu3Sn。圖 1(d)為 Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu 與

與 Cu 墊層經過 1000 小時老化 Cu3Sn
厚度為 1.70 μm，兩者相差約 2.5 倍。
由此可見，添加微量 Ni 於銲錫球中，
會大大降低 Cu3Sn 厚度，當 Ni 的含量
為 0.03 wt.%時，就能有效抑制 Cu3Sn
生長。Cu3Sn 生長厚度隨時間平方根的

2000 小時，Cu3Sn 生長厚度在 1μm、

Cu 墊層反應生成的 Cu3Sn 厚度分別為
3.09 μm、3.21 μm、5.06 μm。 
    在圖 5(d)-(f)固固反應中，我們可
發現有 Kirkendall’s voids 在 Cu3Sn 和
Cu 的界面處生成，推測是因為經過 1
次迴銲後，Sn2.5AgXNi 銲錫球內 Cu
含量未達飽和，從 Cu 墊層端往銲料的
Cu flux 遠大於由銲料往 Cu 墊層端的
Sn flux，孔洞因而產生。Kirkendall’s

    然而，在SnAgCu系列裡Cu3Sn/Cu

是由於我們所自製的銲錫球體積大
(直徑1.36 μm) ，是一般銲錫球(直徑

different. This difference in thermal history could in
turn result in different extents of the chemical reaction,
and possibly different solidification microstructures if
both types of joints become molten during soldering.
This effect is just one of many reasons why electronic
soldering is becoming an ever more challenging
technology.
Those regions on the surface of a chip that are to be
in direct contact with the solders are the so-called un-
der bump metallurgy (UBM) regions. Copper is the
most popular choice for the surface layer of the UBM,
mainly due to its good wetting property with solders [2,
3]. In Fig. 1, Cu is selected for illustration as the sur-
face layer of the UBM, and the Ni layer beneath serves
as the diffusion barrier layer. During assembly or
normal service of the device, the Cu layer will be
consumed completely, exposing the Ni layer to the
solder. Those regions on the BGA and PCB substrates
that are to be in contact with solders are known as the
soldering pads, and the base metal of the soldering
pads is always Cu with a few rare exceptions. The Cu
base metal on the soldering pads of the BGA and PCB
substrates has to be coated with a surface finish (or
final finish) to preserve the wetting property during the
storage period before assembly. Popular surface fin-
ishes include Au/Ni, immersion Sn, immersion Ag, and
organic surface preservative (OSP). In the case of Au/
Ni, the Au layer will be dissolved into the solder
rapidly during soldering [4–15], exposing the Ni layer
below. In the cases of the other three surface finishes,
Sn, Ag, or OSP will be dissolved into the solder
(immersion Sn and immersion Ag) or be displaced
from the interface (OSP) during soldering, leaving the
Cu layer exposed to the solder. In Fig. 1, Au/Ni is used
as the surface finish for the BGA substrate, and OSP
for the PCB substrate. Summarizing all the popular
material choices for the UBM and the surface finishes,
one can expect that the most common material
sequences across a post-assembly solder joints are, Cu/
solder/Cu, Cu/solder/Ni, and Ni/solder/Ni. The Ni layer
here can be deposited by electroplating, electroless
plating, or sputtering. In the electroless process, a few
atomic percents of P are often co-deposited with Ni,
and the Ni layer is customarily labeled as Ni(P). In the
sputtering process, V is often added to the sputtering
target to ease off the Ni magnetic effect to enhance the
deposition rate, resulting in the co-deposition of one or
two atomic percents of V into the Ni layer. This type of
Ni layer is customarily labeled as Ni(V), or simply NiV.
The presence of P or V in the Ni layer do complicate
the chemical interactions between Ni and solders
[16–38], but these reactions still share enough common
features to allow a discussion of them together in this
paper.
Several good review articles for electronic solders
have been published in the past few years [3, 11, 29, 39–
44]. The intention here is not to duplicate their efforts.
The focus of this paper is to review and to present
original data on three key issues related to the inter-
facial reactions between common lead-free solders and
Ni, Cu, or Ni + Cu. The first issue is about the effect of
Ni on the interfacial reactions between solders and Cu
(Sect. 2). Recently, the formation of Kirkendall voids
during the solders/Cu reactions had been observed.
These Kirkendall voids have been attributed to being
the root cause for joint fracture during the drop test.

the Cu3Sn thickness remained very thin even after
aging at 150C for 1,000 h [54]. As the growth of Cu3Sn
is the culprit for the formation of the Kirkendall voids,
the addition of Ni can therefore reduce the amount of
the Kirkendall voids. In fact, recently it had been
shown that the interfacial strength from drop test
indeed increase for solders joints with just a small
amount of Ni addition (< 1 wt.%) [56].
Figure 3 also shows that Ni addition increased the
amount of Cu6Sn5 at the interface compared to that
without Ni addition. In addition, the Cu6Sn5phase now
possessed a small amount of Ni, and became (Cu1-x
Nix)6Sn5. A close examination of Fig. 3(b) reveals that
there were two distinct (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 regions [54].
The inner region was a dense layer of (Cu0.98-
Ni0.02)6Sn5, and the outer region was actually
composed of an aggregate of (Cu0.89Ni0.11)6Sn5 parti-
cles. The compositions noted were carefully deter-
mined by using the electron probe microanalysis
(EPMA). The space between these (Cu0.89Ni0.11)6Sn5
particles was occupied by the solder. It was proposed
that the inner region formed during the solid-state
aging period, and the outer region was the remains of
the (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 formed during the reflow period.
This proposition was supported by the micrographs for
the as-reflow samples shown in Fig. 4 [54]. It can
be seen that Ni addition induced a thicker layer of
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 during the reflow stage. During the
solid-state aging, the region of the aggregate near the
Cu side was converted into the dense (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5
layer, and what was left of the aggregate showed up in
Fig. 3(b). The outer (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 region in Fig. 4(b)
apparently served as a short cut for Sn diffusion, that
enhanced the Cu6Sn5 growth but inhibited the growth
of Cu3Sn. Consequently, the un-desirable growth of
Cu3Sn was hindered. Another possibility for the
shrinkage of Cu3Sn could be attributed to the substi-
tution of Ni into the Cu sublattice of Cu–Sn com-
pound(s), to reduce the interdiffusion coefficient [56].
The observation that Ni addition could induce a
larger amount of (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 during reflow deserves
more attention. It is proposed that this phenomenon is
closely related to the Cu metastable solubility and the
Cu equilibrium solubility in the solder. Here, these two
types of solubility will be briefly discussed first. During
the reaction of Cu with molten solders, it is often
observed that in some regions bare Cu was in direct
contact with the molten solders without being covered

have Cu as a minor constituent (Table 1), and the
allowance for the concentration variation for each ele-
ment is typically ± 0.2 wt.%, a customary adoption of
the practice from the eutectic PbSn solder. As will be
shown below, this ± 0.2 wt.% difference can change the
compound formed at the interface after reflow.
3.1 Uncomplicated Cu concentration effect
During the reflow of SnCu or SnAgCu solders over
those soldering pads that have the Ni, Ni(P), and Ni(V)
underlayer, the reaction product(s) at the interface are
very sensitive to the Cu concentration in the solders.
After the first report [73] of this Cu sensitivity a few
years ago, over forty papers had been published on this
subject. As summarized in Table 2, the results of these
studies as a whole are quite consistent, even though
different reflow conditions and different Ni substrates,
including Ni, Ni(P), Ni(V), or Au/Ni, had been used.
As shown in Table 2, when the Cu concentration was
low (< 0.3 wt.%), only (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 formed at the
interface. When the Cu concentration increased to
0.4–0.5 wt.%, both (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 and (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5
formed. When the Cu concentration increased above
0.5 wt.%, only (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 formed. In a few specific
cases [28, 86, 89–91, 96, 104, 105], where the reported
results seemed to differ from the trend shown in
Table 2 at the first sight, the inconsistency in fact could
be attributed to the so-called ‘‘solder volume effect,’’
which is to be discussed in the next section.
To exclude other factors that may obscure the dis-
cussion, the reaction between a large amount of solder
and a piece of thick, high purity Ni substrate will be
examined first. Since the amount of solder was large,
one can then assume that the solder composition
remained constant during the reaction even though Cu
was being extracting out of the solder to be incorpo-
rated into the reaction product(s). In addition, since
the Ni substrate was thick, the Ni substrate was never
totally consumed. In some aspects, the system
approached the limit of classical infinite/infinite diffu-
sion couple. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the reaction prod-
uct at the interface was a continuous layer of (Ni1-y
Cuy)3Sn4 when the Cu concentration was 0.2 wt.%.
When the Cu concentration increased to 0.4 wt.%,
discontinuous (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 particles began to form
over the (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 continuous layer, Fig. 7(b).
When the Cu concentration increased to 0.5 wt.%,
both (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 and (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 were continu-
ous, Fig. 7(c). When the Cu concentration reached
0.6 wt.%, only a continuous (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layer was
present, Fig. 7(d). The crystal structures of the prod-
ucts had been verified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns shown in Fig. 8 [73, 106]. To obtain such

Cu6Sn5, and only this phase can be immediately next to
L, as shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d).
3.2 Solder volume effect during reaction
with molten solders (reflow)
During reflow and the subsequent aging, Cu atoms are
incorporated into the intermetallic(s) [i.e., (Cu1-x
Nix)6Sn5 and (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4] at the interface. As the
intermetallic(s) grow, more Cu atoms are being con-
sumed. The results presented in the previous section
were for the condition that the amount of the solder
was relatively large so that the supply of Cu was also
large. The average Cu concentration in the solder
could consequently remain nearly constant. The ther-
modynamic condition at the interface was thus static,
and the formation of one compound or another was
more or less dictated by the thermodynamics. For a
real solder joint in array–array packages, the supply of
Cu is actually very limited because the solder volume is
quite small in the first place, and secondly the
Cu concentration in SnAgCu solder is always less than
a few atomic percents (see Table 2). The Cu concen-
tration can decrease noticeably as the intermetallic(s)
grow [89–91]. As the Cu concentration changes,
the type of the equilibrium intermetallic at the inter-
face might also change. Now the condition at the

combinations ranging from the BGA to flip-chip
dimensions is plotted in Fig. 13. For example, if 2 lm
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5, which is the thickness commonly seen
in real solder joints, forms in the 100 lm/80 lm
combination, the Cu concentration will drop by as
large as 0.51 wt.%. Under such a condition, the resi-
due Cu concentration in solder will be less than
0.3 wt.% for most SnAgCu solder compositions listed
in Table 1. If the Cu concentration indeed become
less than 0.3 wt.%, then the Cu6Sn5/molten solder
interface is no longer thermodynamically stable

classical example, shown in Fig. 16, is the spalling of
Cu6Sn5 during the reaction of eutectic PbSn solder with
Au/Cu/Cu–Cr thin film [3, 116]. Spalling here was due
to the exhaustion of the Cu film, and the poor wetting
between Cu6Sn5 and the remaining Cr (or SiO2) caused
the compound to detach itself from the interface. The
‘‘massive spalling’ introduced in this section is not
caused by the exhaustion of a reaction layer. Instead, it
is caused by the consumption of one element inside the
reacting phase, as had been discussed in the previous
section. The shifting of the interfacial equilibrium
causes the product phase to separate itself from the
interface [89–91].
The massive spalling has a higher tendency to occur
in smaller joints because these joints will experience a
lager Cu concentration drop. Fig. 17 shows an example
of massive spalling in its early stage. The reflow con-
ditions were the same as those in Fig. 15, but dpad and
djoint were 175 and 200 lm, respectively. As can be
seen in Fig. 17, a new (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 layer had formed
over the Ni substrate, pushing the original (Cu1-x
Nix)6Sn5 layer away from the interface, and a gap had
appeared between these two layers. It should be
stressed again that even though the reflow conditions
were the same, such spalling did not occur for the
larger joints in Fig. 15(a) and (b). Longer reflow time
also favors the spalling, as shown in Fig. 18. Here, the
sample had the same configuration as that of Fig. 15(c),
but the reflow time was increased from 90 s to 20 min.
Longer reflow time had increased the separation
between (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 and (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 from a
series of voids in Fig. 15(c) to a gap in Fig. 18.
A very revealing example of the massive spalling is
shown in Fig. 19, where a djoint/dpad = 760 lm/600 lm
joint had been reflowed at 235C for 5 min. In this

the joint with the highest Cu concentration (0.7 wt.%),
shown in Fig. 20(g), the amount of Cu was still enough
to sustain a (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layer over the (Ni1-y
Cuy)3Sn4, as shown in Fig. 20(g). But when the Cu
concentration became lower (0.5 and 0.3 wt.% Cu),
shown in Fig. 20(h) and (i), the amount of Cu was not
enough to sustain the (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layer, and only a
(Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 layer was present. It should be noted
that in these two cases (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 did appear over
the (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 layer once during certain time
frame, but (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 eventually disappeared and
be converted into (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4. It can be anticipated
that the (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layer in Fig. 20(g) will also
disappear if this sample is subjected to longer aging.
From our recent study, the formation of both
(Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 and (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layers at the
interface after aging has a negative impact on the
strength of the joints. The joints tend to fail along
the interface of these two compounds. This is
because both these two compounds are quite brittle,
and the interface between two brittle intermetallics
unfortunately tends to be weak, especially for two
compounds originate from two different binary sys-
tems. To avoid the formation of two compounds
simultaneously, both the Cu concentration effect and
the solder volume effect have to be taken into
account at the same time.
4 Cross-interaction between Cu and Ni across
a solder joint
In Sects. 2 and 3, the effect of Ni on the reaction
between Cu and solder and the effect of Cu on the
reaction between Ni and solder are discussed, respec-
tively. In this section, the interaction between Cu and
Ni across a solder joint will be considered. The
importance of such cross-interaction had been reported
in several publications available in the literature [53,
80, 117–120].
4.1 Cross-interaction during reaction with molten
solders (reflow)
To investigate the cross-interaction during the reflow
stage more carefully, the solder joints that were
assembled by two different paths are compared. As
illustrated in Fig. 21, in Path I, the solder (Sn3.5Ag)
was attached to the Cu substrate in the first reflow, and
then the Ni substrate was attached to the other side of
the solder joint in the second reflow. In path II, the
solder was attached to the Ni substrate first (the first
reflow), and in the second reflow Cu substrate was
attached to the other side of the solder joint.
Shown in Fig. 22 are the solder/Cu and Ni/solder
interfaces for Path I (left column) and path II (right

different Cu compositions. Pictures in the first, second, and third

been soldered only once and consequently had no
cross-interaction during aging were shown in the left
column for comparison. In the middle column and the
right column, the corresponding interfaces for the Path
I and Path II after aging are shown, respectively. It can
be seen that Cu3Sn in Fig. 26(d) and (f) are thinner
than that in Fig. 26(b). This is due to the Ni effect
presented in Sect. 2.2. Moreover, Cu3Sn in Fig. 26(f) is
also thinner than that in Fig. 26(d). This is reasonable
because in Path II more Ni was dissolved because Ni in
Path II went through one more reflow than in Path I. In
addition, no Kirkendall void was observed in Fig. 26(d)
and (f) even by the means of FIB sample preparation.
It should also be pointed that the cross-interaction
accelerated the consumption rate of the Cu substrate
and reduced the consumption rate of the Ni substrate
[120]. The Ni consumption rate decreased because the
growth of (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 consumed a less amount of Ni
than did the growth of (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 [81, 107, 117,
120].
5 Summary
The addition of Ni to Sn, SnCu, SnAg, and SnAgCu in
amounts as minute as 0.1 wt.% is able to substantially
hinder the Cu3Sn growth in the reaction between these
solders and the Cu substrate. The growth of Cu3Sn
often accompanies the formation of Kirkendall voids,
which has been linked to the weakening of the solders
joints. Accordingly, Ni has been proposed as a useful
alloying additive to these solders.
Likewise, Cu has a strong effect on the reactions
between these solders and Ni-based substrates. When
the amount of solder is large so that the supply of Cu is
not an issue, the interfacial reaction is dictated by the
Cu–Ni–Sn phase equilibrium, and the types of the
reaction products formed depend on the Cu concen-
tration. Under such a condition, when the Cu concen-
tration is low (£0.3 wt.%), only (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 forms at
the interface. When the Cu concentration increases to
0.4–0.5 wt.%, both (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 and (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5
form. When the Cu concentration increases above
0.5 wt.%, (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 forms. However, in BGA or
flip-chip solder joints, where the solder joints are small
and the Cu supply becomes limited, the solder volume
effect becomes important because the Cu concentra-
tion is no longer constant during the reaction. An
equation, Eq. 1, for the Cu concentration drop has
been derived as a function of the joint size and the
intermetallic compound thickness. As the Cu concen-
tration decreases, the equilibrium phase at the inter-
face may change, and the local thermodynamic
equilibrium at the interface is no longer static. The

plate was then inserted into a fresh molten solder bath at
250 °C. Reaction time ranged between 2 and 10 min.
After the reaction, the samples were cross-sectioned to
reveal the interface and the internal microstructure of the
solders. The compositions of the phases were determined
by a state-of-the-art field-emission electron probe micro-
analyzer (FE-EPMA, JEOL JXA-8500F, Tokyo, Japan).
This FE-EPMA has the capability of lowering the radius
of interaction volume down to as small as 0.5 m so that
accurate composition measurements for thin intermetal-
lic layers can be performed. In this study, at least four
measurements were made for every phase and the aver-
age value was reported. In addition, x-ray diffraction
(XRD) was also carried out to identify the crystal struc-
tures of the reaction products.
Figures 1(a)–1(c) show the reaction products that
formed for different Zn concentrations after reaction at
250 °C for 2 min. When the solder composition was
Sn–0.5Zn [Fig. 1(a)], a layer of compound with the scal-
lop microstructure existed at the interface. The com-
pound had the Cu6Sn5 crystal structure as verified by
XRD analysis [Fig. 2(a)]. The composition of this
Cu6Sn5 layer was determined by FE-EPMA to be 39.1 at.%
Sn, 4.8 at.% Zn, and 56.1 at.% Cu, indicating that a small
amount of Zn had been incorporated into the Sn sublattice
of Cu6Sn5. Consequently, this compound should be more
properly referred to as Cu6(Sn1-xZnx)5. It should be noted
that accurate composition measurements for this compound
layer would have been difficult by using a conventional
EPMA because this layer was too thin. The FE-EPMA used
in this study has a much smaller interaction volume, and
therefore accurate composition measurements could be
performed. We also measured the composition using a
Sn-0.5Zn/Cu sample that had been reacted for 10 min and
had a thicker Cu6(Sn1-xZnx)5 (1.5 m). The measured
Cu6(Sn1-xZnx)5 composition remained the same, suggesting
that the thickness was not an issue and the measured com-
position was accurate. From the fact that only Cu6(Sn1-xZnx)5
formed, one can conclude that the addition of 0.5 wt% Zn
to Sn did not change the chemistry of the pure-Sn/Cu re-
action reported in the literature.10,11 The effect of Zn addi-
tion at this level was that Zn became incorporated into the
Sn sublattice of Cu6Sn5.
However, when the Zn addition was increased to 2
wt%, the chemistry was completely different, as shown
in Fig. 1(c). The reaction product now had the Cu5Zn8
crystal structure as verified by x-ray diffraction analysis
shown in Fig. 2(c). Using samples that were reacted for
2 min and 10 min (larger particles size facilitating more
accurate FE-EPMA measurements), we determined the
composition of Cu5Zn8 to be 1.5 at.% Sn, 59.5 at.% Zn,
and 39.0 at.% Cu. Apparently, Zn was the most reactive
element, and when the Zn concentration was high
enough, the Zn–Cu reaction dominated at the interface.
The type of compound formed here, Cu5Zn8, was the
same as that formed in the reaction between eutectic
SnZn (Sn-9Zn) and Cu substrate.12 Therefore, it can be
expected that the reaction product will be Cu5Zn8 when
the Zn concentration is between 2 and 9 wt%.
When the Zn concentration was 0.7 wt%, two com-
pounds were identified at the interface: a Cu6Sn5-based
compound next to the Cu substrate and a CuZn-based
compound next to the solder, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The
FIG. 1. The cross-section view for the solder/Cu interfaces that re-
acted at 250 °C for 2 min: (a) Sn-0.5Zn/Cu interface, (b) Sn-0.7Zn/Cu
interface, and (c) Sn-2.0Zn/Cu interface. The Sn-0.5Zn/Cu reaction
produced Cu6Sn5. The Sn-2.0Zn/Cu reaction produced Cu5Zn8. The
Sn-0.7Zn/Cu reaction produced Cu6Sn5 and CuZn. A selective Sn
etching solution (5 vol% HCl-methanol) had been used to reveal the
morphologies of reaction zones.

concentration was low (e.g., 0.5 wt%, equivalent to
0.9 at.%), the interface represented a tie-line in the Sn+
Cu6Sn5 two-phase field, and Cu6Sn5 formed next to the
solder. When the Zn concentration was in-between (e.g.,
0.7 wt%, equivalent to 1.3 at.%), the Sn+ Cu6Sn5+ CuZn
three-phase field dominated, and both Cu6Sn5 and CuZn
formed. It should be noted that the CuZn+Sn two-phase
field was not encountered in this study, and the CuZn
phase did not form alone at the interface. Nevertheless, if
a Sn-xZn alloy with Zn concentration between 0.7 and
2 wt% Zn had been used, it was very likely that CuZn
would form alone at the interface.
In this study, the solder volume used was substantially
greater than the actual array–array package solder joints.
Therefore, the results presented here were for the condi-
tion that the amount of the solder was relatively large so
that the supply of Zn was also large. The average Zn
concentration in the solder could therefore remain nearly
constant during the reaction.14,15 The thermodynamic
condition at the interface was thus static, and the forma-
tion of one compound or another was more or less
dictated by the thermodynamics. For a real solder joint in
array–array packages, the supply of Zn is actually very
limited because the solder volume is quite small in
the first place, and secondly the Zn concentration in
Zn-doped SnAgCu solder is always less than a few
atomic percents. The Zn concentration can decrease no-
ticeably as the Zn atoms are incorporated into the
intermetallic. As the Zn concentration changes, the
type of the equilibrium intermetallic at the interface
might also change. Now the condition at the interface
becomes dynamic. The so-call solder volume effect must
be considered because the volume of the solder deter-
mines the total available Zn. As the size of the joints
shrinks, the supply of Zn becomes more limited, and the
decrease in Zn concentration becomes more critical. In
short, a large solder volume was used purposely in this
study to serve as a baseline study, in which only the
concentration effect was at play and the solder volume
effect was not important. Only after the pure concentra-
tion effect is understood can one begin to be able to
understand the combined effect of solder volume effect
and the concentration effect encountered in real solder
joints.
In summary, the intermetallic formed between Cu and
Sn-xZn solders were very sensitive to the Zn concentra-
tion. For low Zn concentration (Sn-0.5Zn), only a
Cu6Sn5-based compound formed. At high Zn concentra-
tion (Sn-2.0Zn), only Cu5Zn8 formed. When the Zn con-
centration was in-between (Sn-0.7Zn), both Cu6Sn5 and
CuZn formed. These three different types of results
might produce interfaces with very different mechanical
properties. If Zn becomes one of the alloying elements in
solder joints, the electronic industry must assess their
choice of the optimal solder composition and strictly
control the Zn concentration to ensure the joints exhibit
consistent interfacial properties.

and Ni.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Figure 1 shows schematically the solder joints
used in this study. Solder balls of different Cu con-
centrations Sn3AgxCu (x 5 0.4, 0.5, or 0.6 wt.%)
and different diameters (djoint 5 300, 500, or 760 mm)
were used to study the inﬂuence of solder volume as
well as the Cu concentration. The solder volume
ratio for the 300-mm, 500-mm, and 760-mm balls
corresponded to 1:4.6:16.3. The contact pads have
only a Ni layer over Cu (i.e., without gold). The
pad opening diameter was 375 mm (i.e., dpad 5 375
mm). The Ni layer was electrolytically plated.
Every substrate was ﬁrst dipped into a dilute
hydrochloric acid solution and then ﬂuxed. The sol-
der balls were placed on the pads and then reﬂowed
for 90 sec to 1 hr at a peak reﬂow temperature of
235(62)°C. After soldering, the solder joints were
metallographically polished to reveal the interface
and the internal microstructure. In order to reveal
intermetallic compounds more clearly, the polished
samples were then etched with a 5 vol.% HCl (in
methanol) solution for a few seconds. The thickness
of the intermetallic compounds (TIMC) was meas-
ured by using an image analysis software. We
deﬁned the thickness as the total area occupied by
the intermetallic divided by the linear length of the
interface.
The composition of reaction product(s) was iden-
tiﬁed by a JEOL JXA-8600SX electron microprobe
(EPMA), operated at 20 keV. During microprobe
measurement, the detected x-ray were Ka, Ka, La,
and La for Cu, Ni, Ag, and Sn, respectively. In
microprobe analysis, the concentrations of each ele-
ment were measured independently, and the total
weight percentage was within 100(61) wt.% in each
case. For every data point, at least four measurements
were made and the average value was reported.
RESULTS
Two reaction products, (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 and (Cu,Ni)6Sn5,
were identiﬁed in this study. These two intermetal-
lic compounds (IMCs) either formed alone or simul-
taneously at the interface after 90 sec to 20 min.
soldering, depending on the solder volume and the
Cu concentration. Table I summarizes the IMCs
formed in each case. These two intermetallics,
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 and (Cu,Ni)6Sn5, had been estab-
lished by using x-ray diffraction (XRD) in our earlier
study15,17 to be based on the Ni3Sn4 and Cu6Sn5
structures, respectively. In the following, the results
would be described in detail.
Sn3Ag0.6Cu Spheres
When a 90-sec soldering reaction between 760-mm
Sn3Ag0.6Cu spheres and Ni/Cu pads took place,
only a layer of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 formed at the interface,
as shown in Fig. 2a. Near the reaction zone, a few
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 spikes with the Ag3Sn particles mounted
in the Sn-dendrite matrix could be identiﬁed. Some
of those spikes were originally connected to the
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer through the third dimension to
extend into the Sn-rich matrix. The (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at
the interface existed as a needle-like layer over the
Ni, which thickened to 2–3 mm thick after the reac-
tion time was prolonged to 20 min. (Fig. 2d). Now
the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer was thick enough to allow us
to determine its composition accurately to be
(Cu0.64Ni0.36)6Sn5 at the center of the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
layer for 760-mm spheres and (Cu0.60Ni0.40)6Sn5 for
500-mm spheres (Table I). There was no visible dif-
ference in these two (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 except the size of
needles. In 500-mm solder joints, the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
needles (Fig. 2b) apparently grew longer than those
of the 760-mm solder joints (Fig. 2a). The mecha-
nism for the distinct (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 needles requires
more-detailed study. The formation of only the
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 at the interface is consistent with
the results reported in the literatures,15,16 where
the bulk reactions between Sn3.9Ag0.6Cu and Ni
were examined.
However, the situation became radically different
when a smaller solder volume was used for soldering.
Figure 2c showed the results for the 90-sec reaction
between a 300-mm solder sphere and Ni. The reduc-
tion in the solder volume changed the needle-like
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 into a round and particle-like layer
(;1.7 mm). In addition to the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 com-
pound, a layer of a (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 compound was
detected within the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5/Ni interface. The
presence of the (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 in the 0.6 wt.%
Cu-content solder joints was quite unusual considering

dered onto a Ni/Cu pad. The parameters, djoint and dpad, represent
the diameter of joint and pad. TIMC represents the thickness of the

2c), there were two intermetallics, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 over
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4, nucleated at the interface simultane-
ously (Fig. 5c). Inside the solder, some (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
mixed with (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 was found near the inter-
face. As shown in Fig. 5c, the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 grains
were olive-like particles with a hexagonal cross sec-
tion, while the (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 particles were parallelo-
gram-shaped. The variation in the morphologies of
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 was attributed to the
fact that they were based on different crystal struc-
tures. Above all, the results from electron micro-
probe showed that these particles had very similar
compositions with the phases that were still
attached to the interface. This evidence indicated
that these particles might originate from the inter-
face, and then spalled into the solder. When the
reaction time reached 20 min., (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 would
replace the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 as a continuous layer, and
most of the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 had left the interface (Fig.
5f), resembling the case of Sn3Ag0.6Cu/Ni (Fig. 2f)
but with the amount of (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 here being
lower and scattered.
Sn3Ag0.4Cu Spheres
The transition from one single (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 phase
to two (Cu,Ni)6Sn5-(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 phases also oc-
curred in larger solder joints, as the Cu concentra-
tion further decreased from 0.5 wt.% to 0.4 wt.%.
This transitional concentration of Cu actually corre-
sponded to the results reported in the literature16
where the supply of Cu was inﬁnite. Shown in Fig.
6a–c are the results of Ni soldered with the
Sn3Ag0.4Cu for 90 sec. Regardless of the solder vol-
umes, interestingly, (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 started to grow in
all of the samples in spite of the fact that Cu con-
centration decreased by only 0.1 wt.%. Above the
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 phase was a dense (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer
(Fig. 6a). However, the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer spalled
into the solder when the solder balls decreased from
760 mm to 300 mm (Fig. 6a–c). Inversely, the row of
voids like those mentioned in Fig. 2c increased at
the interface with decreasing solder volume. As the
joint shrunk to 300 mm, the underlying (Ni,Cu)3Sn4
would completely replace the original (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 to
be in contact with solder and Ni (Fig. 6c). When the
reaction time was increased to 20 min., both
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 would grow thicker
(see Fig. 6d and e). Figure 7 was a zoom-in back-
scattered electron image of the interface of Fig. 6d.
It could be seen clearly that a white, wavy
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 layer formed between (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and
Ni. Also noted that there were some white spots like
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 present within the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer.
However, the area of these white spots was not thick
enough to have their compositions determined by
EPMA accurately. A further study of FE-EPMA or
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis is
needed to clarify. As the joints shrunk to 300 mm,
similarly, there was only a layer of (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 with
spalled (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 present in the
reaction zone (Fig. 6f).
DISCUSSION
Cu Concentration Effect on the Soldering
Reactions with Inﬁnite Cu Supply
The ‘‘Cu concentration effect’’ reported in the lit-
eratures15–17 was established in bulk reactions
where the supply of Cu approached inﬁnity. As a
result, the Cu concentration could be assumed to
be constant during the study. In those studies, the
interface had reached local equilibrium and the Cu-
Ni-Sn isotherm19 could be used to rationalize the
formation of the reaction product(s).16 For example,
when the Cu concentration was high, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5
was predicted to form next to the (Sn) phase due
to the diffusion path would pass through the (Sn) 1
(Cu,Ni)6Sn5 two-phase ﬁeld ﬁrst (point a in Fig. 8).
When the Cu concentration was low, the diffusion
path would pass through the (Sn) 1 (Ni,Cu)3Sn4
two-phase ﬁeld ﬁrst (point b in Fig. 8), and
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4 was predicted to form next to the (Sn)
phase. When the Cu concentration was in-between, the
diffusion path would pass through the three-phase

Effect of Limited Cu Supply
The supply of Cu in this study was limited. It
decreased with the formation of Cu-bearing inter-
metallics, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 and (Ni,Cu)3Sn4. The growth
of these Cu-bearing intermetallics made the Cu con-
centration decrease to such a low level that the
interfacial reaction was affected. According to the
diffusion paths in the Cu-Ni-Sn isotherm (Fig. 8),
this reduction in Cu concentration would change
the equilibrium phase at the interface to a high
degree, which destabilized the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 layer at
the interface. Consequently, (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 massively
spalled from the interface. In other words, we pro-
pose that the driving force for (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 to spall
massively from the interface originates from the
drastic drop of Cu concentration.
In the following, let us consider the relationship
between the drop of Cu concentration and the solder
volume. From the mass balance of Cu, the total
amount of Cu in a solder joint (Fig. 1) is equal to
the amount of Cu in solder plus the amount of Cu in
intermetallic(s). As a result,

where w0Cu and wCu represent the Cu concentration
(wt.%) in SnAgCu before and after the soldering,
respectively. The terms djoint and dpad represent
the diameter of the solder joint and the dia-
meter of pad’s opening, respectively (see Fig. 1).
The quantities rsolder and rIMC represent the den-
sity of SnAgCu and the intermetallic, respectively.
The symbol TIMC represents the thickness of
IMC. The densities of Sn3Ag(0.4–0.6)Cu solder
spheres were determined by using a balance with
0.0001-g precision to be ;7.4 g/cm3. In this study,
(Cu0.60Ni0.40)6Sn5 and (Ni0.80Cu0.20)3Sn4 were the
only two Cu-bearing intermetallics that could
present at the interface. The densities of Cu6Sn5
and Ni3Sn4 are 8.28 g/cm
3 and 8.65 g/cm3, respec-
tively.20 There are no literature values for the den-
sities of (Cu0.60Ni0.40)6Sn5 and (Ni0.80Cu0.20)3Sn4.
Nevertheless, Cu and Ni are immediate neighbors
on the periodic table, and they have similar atomic
weights and radii. Consequently, it is reasonable to
approximate the densities of (Cu0.60Ni0.40)6Sn5 and
(Ni0.80Cu0.20)3Sn4 with those of Cu6Sn5 and Ni3Sn4.

the Sn3Ag0.7Cu solder was soldered over a Ag
(0.6 mm)/Ni (1 mm)/Ti (0.15 mm)metallization. Indeed,
the fact that only (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 grew in such a high
Cu concentration joint (Sn3Ag0.7Cu) revealed that
the soldering reaction not only depended on its orig-
inal Cu concentration but also on the solder volume.
Here two methods are proposed to inhibit the mas-
sive spalling. The ﬁrst is to use a high Cu-bearing
solder. The transition from the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 compound
to the (Ni,Cu)3Sn4 compound was indeed been
delayed in the Sn3Ag1.0Cu joint with 300 mm/375
mm ball/pad combinations (Fig. 11). The second
method is to provide an inﬁnite Cu source, such as
a thick Cu layer on either side of a solder joint. Our
latest results also supported this view.
CONCLUSION
In the bulk reaction, the supply of Cu was inﬁnite,
and the soldering reactions between Sn-Ag-Cu and
Ni strongly depend on the Cu concentration. In real
joints with limited Cu supply, the reactions also
depend on the solder volume. The available Cu in
solder decreases as the Cu-bearing intermetallic
grows. This will change the Cu concentration in sol-
der, and consequently the equilibrium intermetallic
at the interface may also change. This complication
is more severe for smaller joints as less Cu is avail-
able. In the case of Cu concentration decreasing
from a concentration higher than 0.4 wt.% to less
than 0.4 wt.% during reﬂow, the (Cu,Ni)6Sn5 which
is originally at the interface will spall massively
because now the solder prefers to be in contact with
(Ni,Cu)3Sn4.

temperature processing step before the diffusion
couples are subjected to the planned interdiffusion.
If the diffusion couple had been prepared by melting
the solder to bond Au and Cu, then a certain degree
of cross-interaction might have occurred during
bonding. The cross-interaction during the bonding
stage could be, in fact, substantial because it had
been reported that Cu and Ni could cross-interact
during the reflow.17 Consequently, in those diffusion
couples bonded by melting, it will be difficult to dis-
tinguish to the extent of the cross-interactions that
have occurred during the bonding stage from that
during the reaction stage.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
The Au/Sn/Cu diffusion couples were prepared by
electroplating a seven m Au layer and a 100-m
Sn layer over the Cu foil substrate. The Cu foil was
400 m thick and 99.6 wt.% pure. Before electroplat-
ing, each Cu foil surface was polished, with 1-m
diamond abrasive used in the last polishing step.
The Cu foil was then lightly etched in a 5 vol.%
HNO3-CH3OH solution for 1 min. and cleaned with
deionized water. After electroplating the Au and Sn
layers, the foil was cut into 4 mm × 8 mm diffusion
couples.
The diffusion couples were then subjected to aging
at 200°C. After aging, these samples were mounted
in epoxy, sectioned by using a low-speed diamond
saw, and metallographically polished to reveal the
microstructure. The reaction zone for each diffu-
sion couple was examined by using the optical mi-
croscopy (OM) and the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). The compositions of the intermetallic com-
pounds were determined by the electron probe
microanalysis (EPMA). In EPMA analysis, the con-
centration of each element was measured inde-
pendently, and the total weight percentage of all
elements was within 100 ± 1% in each case. The
average value from at least three measurements
was then reported.
RESULTS
The as-deposited Au/Sn/Cu diffusion couple is
shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen here, there was no
evidence of interfacial reaction during the electro-
plating of Au and Sn. Nevertheless, the inter-
facial reaction occurred very quickly at 200°C, as
shown in Fig. 2 for a diffusion couple that had been
aged for 10 min. Figure 2a shows that three Au-Sn
binary compounds, AuSn, AuSn2, and AuSn4, and
an Au-Cu-Sn ternary compound existed at the origi-
nal Au/Sn interface. Based on the results that are
to be presented later, we propose this Au-Cu-Sn
compound has the Cu6Sn5 crystal structure with a
small amount of Au dissolved in the Cu sublat-
tice, i.e., (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5. The fast Au-Sn reaction
is not surprising, as such rapid reactions have been
reported before.15,18 However, the formation ofFig. 1. Microstructure of the as-deposited Au/Sn/Cu ternary diffusion

thick.

35.8 at.% Cu, and 49.5 at.% Sn. According to the
190°C Au-Cu-Sn isotherm determined by Zakel16
and reproduced in Fig. 6, this composition corre-
sponded to the composition of (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 at the
Sn-AuSn4-(Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 three-phase equilibrium.
As for the reaction on the Cu side, the thickness of
(Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 as well as Cu3Sn increased as the
reaction time increased, as shown in Fig. 4c. The
(Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 phase now had substantial amount
of Au dissolved (x 0.23–0.25), but Au was still not
detected in Cu3Sn. In Fig. 4b, one also noticed that
there were AuSn4 particles inside the Sn layer. The
existence of these particles will be explained in the
discussion section. As shown in Table I, the compo-
sition of (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 did not change with the re-
action time.
The thickness of (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 on the Au side as
well as that on the Cu side is plotted against the
square root of time in Fig. 7. Also shown in Fig. 7 is
the thickness of Cu6Sn5 from the binary Sn/Cu dif-
fusion couple. The configuration, preparation, and
aging treatment of these binary diffusion couples
were the same as those of the Au/Sn/Cu ternary dif-
fusion couples, except that the Au layer was not de-
posited. As can be seen in Fig. 7, (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 on
the Au side was the thickest, while (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5
on the Cu side is the thinnest. The data in Fig. 7 are
summarized in Table II.
DISCUSSION
The Au-Sn-Cu phase diagram had been studied by
Roeder at 170°C19 and by Zakel at 190°C.16 The one
determined by Zakel (redrawn in Fig. 6) is to be used
for the discussion as the temperature (190°C) is
closer to our experimental condition. In Fig. 6, a dif-
fusion path for the diffusion couple that had been
aged for 24 hr is also shown. One question naturally
arises is that why AuSn4 on the Au side was covered
with a layer of (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5, while those AuSn4
particles inside the Sn layer was not, even though
these particles were located closer to the Cu source?
The diffusion path shown in Fig. 6 clearly rational-
ized that such diffusion path was allowed. In other
words, such feature was not forbidden for ternary
diffusion couples.
The thicknesses of (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 under various
conditions were shown in Fig. 7. The three sets of
data all seemed to follow the parabolic kinetics. The
(Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 on the Au side was the thickest,
while that on the Cu side was the thinnest. The total
consumption of the Cu foil corresponded to the for-
mation of (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 on the Au side and the Cu
side. Comparing the amounts of this compound
formed for the case with and without the Au layer,
the existence of the Au layer clearly accelerated the
Cu consumption. Apparently, the existence of the Au
layer provided extra driving force, which accelerated
the Cu consumption.
The data in Fig. 7 and also enables us to calculate
the Au flux and Cu flux across the Sn layer. This is
because the solubilities of Au and Cu in Sn are very
low, about 0.2 at.% for Au in solid Sn at 200°C20 and
0.01 at.% for Cu in solid Sn at 227°C,21 and conse-
quently the amounts of Cu and Au present in the Sn
layer can be ignored. We also neglected the Au
present in the form of AuSn4 inside the Sn layer.
From the EPMA measurement, the compositions of
the (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 phase on both sides were known.
With these assumptions, the integration of the Au
flux over time correspond to the amount of Au that
was incorporated into (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 on the Cu side
per unit area, and the integration of the Cu flux over
time corresponded to the amount of Cu presented in
Fig. 6. Au-Cu-Sn ternary isotherm at 190°C. This isotherm was re-
drawn from the data determined by Zakel.16

exhibits similar rations. Apparently, the difference
in the values of the diffusivity is larger than that of
the atomic flux. The difference between the relative
magnitude of the flux and the diffusivity is probably
due to the different driving forces for the diffusion of
Au and Cu across the Sn layer.
In Fig. 4a, there is a Sn phase between AuSn4 and
(Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 interface. These Sn formed only af-
ter AuSn2 had disappeared and AuSn4 became the
only Au-Sn binary compound. We believe these Sn
came from the decomposition of the AuSn4 phase.
The AuSn4 phase had to decompose to release Au, so
that Au can react with the incoming Cu to form
(Cu1−xAux)6Sn5. In other words, (Cu1−xAux)6Sn5
grew at the expense of AuSn4. In fact, if we let the
reaction continue, all AuSn4 will be consumed, and
the only compound left at that interface will be
(Cu1−xAux)6Sn5. The released Sn from the decompo-
sition accumulated and became the Sn phase.
CONCLUSIONS
At 200°C, the Cu atoms could diffuse through the
100-m Sn layer and resulted in the formation of the
(Cu1−xAux)6Sn5 on the Au side in 10 min. Under the
same conditions, the Au atoms could diffuse through
the Sn layer and became incorporated in the Cu6Sn5
compound. These are evidences showing that Au
and Cu can cross-interact across a distance of 100
m even when Sn is in the solid state. During the
joining process by soldering, the solder becomes mol-
ten and the cross-interaction becomes even more
substantial. Consequently, the results of this study
shows that the cross-interaction of Au and Cu in
solders is extremely rapid and cannot be ignored in
those solder joints that have both elements present.

structure was produced. When this AuSn/Au5Sn/Ni
layered structure was subjected to aging at 240°C,
the AuSn layer gradually exchanged its position
with the Au5Sn layer, and formed a Au5Sn/AuSn/Ni
layered structure in less than 9 h. The dominant
diffusing species in the AuSn and Au5Sn phases has
also been identified to be Au and Sn, respectively.
The objective of this study is to study the reaction of
the Au20Sn solder and the other common surface
finish metal Cu. The difference between the Sn/Au/
Ni reaction and the Sn/Au/Cu reaction will also be
compared with the eventual purpose of identifying a
better surface finish metal for the Au20Sn solder.
EXPERIMENTAL
The samples used in this study were formed by
depositing the Sn/Au/Ni or Sn/Au/Cu three-layer
sandwich structure onto Si wafers through evapora-
tion. For the Sn/Au/Ni samples, the thickness of Sn,
Au, and Ni was 2.5 $m, 3.75 $m, and 2.0 $m, re-
spectively. For the Sn/Au/Cu samples, the thickness
of Sn, Au, and Cu was 1.83 $m, 2.74 $m, and 5.8 $m,
respectively. The amounts of Au and Sn in these two
types of samples, if uniformly mixed, will produce an
alloy with the Au20Sn composition.
The samples were first bonded for 2 min either at
240°C or at 290°C. This short processing time at
240°C or 290°C was long enough for the Au layer
and the Sn layer to react to produce a Au20Sn alloy
over the Ni or Cu substrates, forming the Au20Sn/Ni
or the Au20Sn/Cu diffusion couples. Then, the
Au20Sn/Ni and Au20Sn/Cu diffusion couples were
aged at 240°C for up to 1000 h. Subsequently, the
samples were mounted in epoxy and metallurgically
polished in preparation for characterization. The re-
action zone for each sample was examined using a
scanning electron microscope (SEM). The composi-
tions of each phase were determined using a JEOL
JXA-8800M electron microprobe (Japan Electron
Optics Ltd., Tokyo), operated at 20 keV. In micro-
probe analysis, the concentration of each element
was measured independently, and the total weight
percentage of all elements was within 100 ± 1% in
each case. The average value from at least three
measurements was then reported. For the x-ray dif-
fraction (XRD) analysis, the Cu K" radiation was
used.
RESULTS
In the following, the microstructure evolution dur-
ing bonding at 290°C or 240°C for two min to form
Au20Sn/Ni and Au20Sn/Cu is presented first. Then
the results from the aging of Au20Sn/Ni and
Au20Sn/Cu at 240°C are presented.
Bonding Reaction at 290°C or 240°C for 2 Min
As mentioned earlier, the microstructure of
Au20Sn on Ni could be controlled by the bonding
conditions of the Sn/Au/Ni sandwich. When the
bonding condition was at 290°C for 2 min, the mi-
crostructure of (Au, Ni)5Sn and (Au, Ni)Sn was a
eutectic type, as shown in Fig. 1a. When the bonding
condition was at 240°C for 2 min, both (Au, Ni)5Sn
and (Au, Ni)Sn has a layered morphology, as shown
in Fig. 1b. The phase sequence was also different for
these two cases. At 290°C, (Au, Ni)Sn was next to
the Ni phase, while (Au, Ni)5Sn was next to the Ni
phase at 240°C.
This sensitivity of the microstructure to the bond-
ing conditions also exists for the Sn/Au/Cu samples.
Figure 2a shows the microstructure of Sn/Au/Cu af-
ter bonding at 290°C for 2 min. The two reaction
products formed over Cu were (Au, Cu)5Sn and (Au,
Cu)Sn, according to the electron-probe microanaly-
sis (EPMA) measurements. These two compounds
have Au5Sn and AuSn crystal structures, respec-
tively, but have small amounts of Cu dissolved in the
Au sublattices. From the EPMA measurements, the
concentration of Cu was 2.5 at.% in (Au, Cu)Sn and
17 at.% in (Au, Cu)5Sn. Consequently, these two
phases here can be labeled as (Au0.95Cu0.05)Sn and
(Au0.80Cu0.20)5Sn, respectively. The (Au, Cu)5Sn
phase was a continuous layer, but the (Au, Cu)Sn
phase was discontinuous. In contrast, bonding at
Fig. 1. Microstructures of Sn/Au/Ni after bonding for 2 min at (a)
290°C and (b) 240°C. The reaction products were (Au, Ni)5Sn and(Au, Ni)Sn in both cases, but had different morphologies. An eutectic
microstructure formed at 290°C, and a layered microstructure
formed at 240°C.
Tsai, Chang, Ho, Lin, and Kao66
time reached 10 h, the microstructure became very
complicated, as shown in Fig. 3b. The composition of
(Au, Cu)Sn remained (Au0.94Cu0.06)Sn. In addition,
there were a Cu40Au40Sn20 phase, an Au-Cu-Sn ter-
nary compound with unknown composition, an
AuCu phase with a small amount of Sn dissolved,
and a Cu3Au phase with a small amount of Sn dis-
solved. The composition of the Au-Cu-Sn ternary
compound as well as the Sn contents in AuCu and
Cu3Au could not be measured accurately because
these phases were too small for accurate EPMA.
When the reaction time reached 25 h (Fig. 3c), the
composition of the outer layer was Au35Cu47Sn18 ac-
cording to the EPMA measurement. According to
the x-ray diffraction analysis shown in Fig. 5, this
compound was based on the Au6.6Cu9.6Sn3.8 struc-
ture. This compound Au6.6Cu9.6Sn3.8 was not in the
Au-Cu-Sn isotherm shown in Fig. 4, but has been
identified and indexed in the literature.8 In addi-
tion, there were an Au-Cu-Sn ternary compound, a
CuAu(Sn) phase, and a Cu3Au(Sn) phase. Again, the
exact compositions could not be determined accu-
rately.
As shown in Fig. 6, the aging behavior of those
Sn/Au/Cu samples that were bonded at 240°C for 2
min was very similar to those that were bonded at
Fig. 4. The Au-Cu-Sn ternary isotherm at 190°C. This isotherm was
determined by Zakel.7

Cu that was aged at 240°C for 1000 h. The upper
layer became Au2Cu6Sn2 according to the x-ray dif-
fraction analysis (Fig. 11). The Au2Cu6Sn2 phase
was not in the Au-Cu-Sn isotherm shown in Fig. 4,
but its existence and crystal structure have been
established in the literature.9 The consumed thick-
ness of Cu now was 4.8 $m, much greater than that
of Ni.
DISCUSSION
There are several differences between the Sn/Au/
Ni or Sn/Au/Cu diffusion couples. During the bond-
ing, Au5Sn preferred to form next to Cu in both
bonding conditions, as shown in Fig. 2, and AuSn
preferred to form next to Ni, as shown in Fig. 1a. It
should be noted that, even though Au5Sn initially
formed next to Ni when the bonding temperature
was at 240°C, as shown in Fig. 1b, Au5Sn and AuSn
exchanged their positions during aging and the
AuSn phase eventually was next to Ni, as shown in
Fig. 7. In other words, before extensive interactions
between Au20Sn and Ni or Cu, the Au5Sn phase in
Au20Sn has a tendency to be next to Cu, and the
AuSn phase has a tendency to be next to Ni. This
observation indicates that the selection of the con-
tact materials can influence the microstructures of
the Au20Sn. The reason that Cu and Ni have differ-
ent affinities toward Au5Sn and AuSn is not clear at
present. According to the Au-Cu-Sn isotherm shown
in Fig. 4, there are tie-lines between Au5Sn and the
Au-Cu solid solution, but there is no tie-line between
the AuSn and the Au-Cu phases. Therefore, the af-
finity between Au5Sn and Cu can be rationalized
with this thermodynamic argument. However, this
type of argument cannot be applied to explain the
affinity between AuSn and Ni, as neither AuSn nor
Au5Sn is in thermodynamic equilibrium with Ni ac-
cording to the Au-Ni-Sn isotherm shown in Fig. 12.
Consequently, for the Ni case we can only say that
the system simply chooses that particular diffusion
path.
The results of this study also show that the ther-
mal stability of Au20Sn/Ni was better than that of
Au20Sn/Cu when these diffusion couples were sub-
jected to long-term aging at 240°C. However, even
for the Au20Sn/Ni couple, the (Au, Ni)Sn/Ni inter-
face in Fig. 1 or 7 was not in thermodynamic equi-
librium according to the Au-Ni-Sn isotherm shown
in Fig. 12.10 Considering a diffusion couple between
Ni and the (Au, Ni)Sn phase, there is no tie-line
connecting these two phases. Therefore, the (Au,
Ni)Sn/Ni interface was not in thermodynamic equi-
librium. It follows that there was a driving force for
a new phase to form at the (Au, Ni)Sn/Ni interface.
According to the isotherm, the (Ni, Au)3Sn2 phase
has a good chance to form at the interface because of
the fact that there is a tie-line between Ni and (Ni,
Au)3Sn2 as well as between (Ni, Au)3Sn2 and (Au,
Ni)Sn. For the Au20Sn/Ni diffusion couple, aging at
240°C for 1000 h made the (Au, Ni)Sn phase disap-
pear and induced the formation of (Ni, Au)3Sn2 and

Nickel is a very common metal surface finish used in the

derable diffusion barrier layer to prevent the rapid reaction
between the solder and the Cu layer below. The reactions be-
tween Ni and solders had been studied before [7–26]. It had
been reported that the reaction of Ni with liquidSn–Ag–Cu or
Sn–Cu solders were very sensitive to the Cu concentration in
the solders [12–15]. At low Cu concentrations (≤0.2 wt.%),
only a continuous (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 layer formed at the in-
terface. When the Cu concentration increased to 0.4 wt.%, a
continuous (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 layer and a small amount of dis-
continuous (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 particles formed at the interface.
When the Cu concentration increased to 0.5 wt.%, the amount
of (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 increased and (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 became
a continuous layer. Beneath this (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 layer was a
very thin but continuous layer of (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4. At higher
Cu concentrations (0.6–3.0 wt.%), (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 disap-
peared, and only (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 was present. These studies
show that a precise control over the Cu concentration in the
solders is needed to produce consistent results during reflow,
which is a reaction between liquid solders and solid substrate.

(Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 particles formed above (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4.
When the Cu concentration increased to 0.5 wt.%, the
(Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 phase became a continuous layer over the
(Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 layer. At higher Cu concentrations (0.6 and
0.8 wt.%), (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 was not detected, but a continu-
ous (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 layer formed between Ni and the solder.

with different aging time. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, only a
layer of (Ni
after 150 h
to 500 h and longer, a (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 layer formed over the
(Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 layer as shown in Fig. 1c and d. These two
compounds (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 and (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 are based
on the Cu6Sn5 and Ni3Sn4 crystal structures, respectively, as
established using X-ray diffraction in an earlier study [12].
Right after reflow, the Cu atoms scattered randomly through-
out the entire solder joint. However, after aging for sufficient
amounts of time, some of the Cu went back to the interface
and formed (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5. Fig. 2 is an EPMA line-scan for
the Sn–3.9Ag–0.2Cu solder joint that had been aged at 180
◦C for 1000 h. As can be seen in Fig. 2, substantial amount
of Ni atoms were dissolved in (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5, reaching
about (Cu0.57Ni0.43)6Sn5. The compound (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4
can also dissolve appreciable amount of Cu, reaching about
(Ni0.8–0.9Cu0.2–0.1)3Sn4, according to the data in Fig. 2. It
should be noted that the composition of (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 and
(Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 here are quite similar to what had been re-
ported for the solid-state reaction between Sn–Cu solders and
Ni by Chen et al. [26].
The formation of a (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 + (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4
double-layer after the solid-state aging was not limited to
the Sn–3.9Ag–0.2Cu solder. For the Sn–3.9Ag–0.4Cu sol-
der and the Sn–3.9Ag–0.5Cu solder, both (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5
and (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 were present initially (after reflow), and
both (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 and (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 grew thicker and
became continuous layers, similar to those in Fig. 2d.

joints. As shown in Fig. 3a, only a layer of (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5

(Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 is not in thermodynamic equilibrium with
Ni. Therefore, for the cases of high Cu concentrations, where
there was only a layer of (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 over Ni, there
was driving force for the (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 phase to nucleate
and grow between the (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 layer and the Ni
layer. For the cases of low Cu concentrations, where these
was only a layer (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 over Ni, the Cu inside
the solder would diffuse back to the interface and formed
a layer of (Cu1− yNiy)6Sn5 over the (Ni1− xCux)3Sn4 layer.
In this case, the Cu inside the solder existed in the form
of Cu6Sn5. The compound Cu6Sn5 would decompose and

Controlling the Microstructures from the Gold-Tin Reaction 183
Ni substrate. Specifically, we investigate the possibil-
ity of producing Au20Sn solder joints on a Ni sub-
strate with different microstructures by changing
the bonding condition.
EXPERIMENTAL
The samples used in this study, illustrated
schematically in Fig. 1, were formed by depositing
an Sn/Au/Ni three-layer structure onto the Si wafer
(300-µm thick) through evaporation. The thick-
nesses of the Sn, Au, and Ni layers were 2.5 µm,
3.75 µm, and 2.0 µm, respectively. This amount of
Au and Sn, if uniformly mixed, will produce an alloy
with the Au20Sn composition.
The samples were reacted for 2 min either at
240°C or at 290°C. Then, all the samples were aged
at 240°C for up to 72 h. Subsequently, the samples
were mounted in epoxy and metallurgically polished
in preparation for characterization. The reaction
zone for each sample was examined using scan-
ning electron microscopy (SEM). The compositions
of each phase were determined using an electron
probe microanalyzer (EPMA) operated at 20 keV. In
microprobe analysis, the concentration of each ele-
ment was measured independently, and the total
weight percentage of all elements was within 100 
1% in each case. The average value from at least
three measurements was then reported.
RESULTS
Figure 2a shows the resulting Au20Sn microstruc-
ture after reaction at 290°C for 2 min. The two reac-
tion products formed over Ni are (Au,Ni)5Sn and
(Au,Ni)Sn according to the EPMA measurements.
These two compounds have the Au5Sn and AuSn
crystal structures, respectively, but have small
amounts of Ni dissolved in the Au sublattice. From
the EPMA measurements (summarized in Table I),
the Ni concentration is 1.1 at.% in (Au,Ni)5Sn, and
8.6 at.% in (Au,Ni)Sn. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the
reaction products have a two-phase, aggregate-type
microstructure. This is quite reasonable because the
reaction temperature (290°C) was higher than the
Au5Sn  AuSn eutectic temperature of 278°C. This
aggregate microstructure was partially due to the so-
lidified eutectic microstructure. At least part of the
Sn and Au layers became molten during the reaction.

Controlling the Microstructures from the Gold-Tin Reaction 185
layer had completely disappeared, and the (Au,Ni)Sn
layer has completely exchanged its position with the
(Au,Ni)5Sn layer. When the reaction time was 72 h
(Fig. 6d), there was a thin intermetallic compound
layer between (Au,Ni)Sn and Ni. According to EPMA
line scan shown in Fig. 7, this compound is an Au-Ni-
Sn ternary compound. This compound is again prob-
ably the Ni3Sn2 phase with a large amount of Au
dissolved. The Ni concentration in the (Au,Ni)Sn
layer had become very Ni rich, reaching 20.0 at.%.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study show that the microstruc-
tures of the Au20Sn solder joint can be controlled by
controlling the reaction condition. For a reaction at
290°C for 2 min, the microstructure is the aggregate
type, i.e., a mixture of (Au,Ni)Sn and (Au,Ni)5Sn.
According to the Au-Ni-Sn isotherm14 (Fig. 5), both
AuSn and Au5Sn can dissolve appreciable amounts
of Ni. At room temperature, AuSn can dissolve up to
27 at.% Ni and Au5Sn can dissolve up to 5 at.% Ni. A
ternary intermetallic compound often has a lower
Gibbs free energy compared to a binary compound of
the same structure from the entropy argument.
Therefore, both AuSn and Au5Sn have the natural
tendency to absorb Ni to reach their saturated com-
positions. Other than coarsening, the aggregate-type
