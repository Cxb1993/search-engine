Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is in an attempt to image the interior of human tissues. However, 
the NIR imaging suffers from low resolution due to the diffusive nature of the scattered light, which 
results into poor reconstructed image quality. Thus, the effort to improve the image quality remains 
in progress. The numerical simulation using high-pass filtering incorporated into the 
finite-element-based diffusion equation to reconstruct tomographic images of optical properties was 
performed where results reveal that several inclusions (tumors) can be well defined separately, 
thereby demonstrating the ability to highly resolve the image of interest with the optimal high-pass 
filtering process.

1. 前言(含研究目的、文獻探討) 
Over the last several decades, there is great enthusiasm in developing medical imaging techniques to 
improve the ability of physicians to detect and diagnose tumors and disease. There is an NIR 
spectral window from about 700 nm to 1100 nm wherein the absorption is relatively small, which 
permit transillumination of the biological tissue. With the difficulty from the strongly scattering 
effects in human tissue, contrast and resolution of the optical images are severely reduced.  
Compared with conventional X-ray mammography, MRI, and ultrasound imaging all having 
superior resolution, but the low intrinsic contrast available, NIR imaging has exceptionally high 
intrinsic contrast, but exhibits inferior spatial resolution achieved as a result of the highly scattering 
nature of tissue in NIR. Many efforts have been made to improve NIR optical tomographic image 
resolution through different ways [1-9]. 
As known, when simply implementing high-pass (H.P.) filtering to highly resolve DOT images, it is 
not suitable that the procedure of the conventional approach is usually as ‘routine steps’: H.P. 
filtering, weighted original image and then histogram equalization [10-12]. Therefore, this 
traditional processing procedure as image processing is performed on optical-property images 
between a reconstruction and the true distribution; for instance, one may be more interested in 
estimating the true value than obtaining visual effect. In this work, we attempt to develop a 
systematic approach to adopting the H.P. filtering for value-preserved images such as medical 
images. 
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the super-resolution algorithm, 
illustrates our novel approach to implementing H.P. filter for optical tomography, and summarizes 
the finite-element-based image reconstruction algorithm. Section 3 will implement this approach on 
several DOT images to show results and include discussions over reconstructed images. Finally, we 
draw conclusions and future work in Sec. 4.

The procedure of FEM-based image reconstruction in the DC domain is illustrated in Fig. 1. As 
indicated, the proposed approach is merely implemented subsequently posterior to each iteration 
without modifying much of the original FEM-based image reconstruction.

3. 結果與討論 
In this section, we present results and discussions of implementing our proposed algorithm 
described in Sec. 2 to the phantoms schematically illustrated in Fig. 2 including three or two 
inclusions with varied sizes, locations and separations. The numerical simulations of multi-inclusion 
phantoms provide further information to discuss about the spatial (separation, size, and location) 
and contrast resolution than that of the single-inclusion one. Of the phantom, the background 
absorption and scattering values are about 0.0025 mm-1 and 0.25 mm-1, respectively, while the 
maximum absorption and scattering for the inclusion are 0.025 mm-1 and 2.5 mm-1, thereby

Here, this proposed filtering technique was implemented in the continuous wave for the absorption 
images; in addition, it is believed that our approach is suitable for the DOT imaging system in the 
frequency domain to improve the diffusion images as well.
