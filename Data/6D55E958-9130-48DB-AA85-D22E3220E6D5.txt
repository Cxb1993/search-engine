zero of the open-stub line appears at the normalized frequency
when the electric length is 90 .
Moreover, by using the open-stub lines, the notch effect can
make circuit size more compact, and also generate two trans-
mission zeros between two separated passbands to greatly en-
hance the degree of isolation, which will reduce the image signal
in the receiver link. Although the higher order method, adding
more sections of the asymmetrical short-circuit coupled lines,
can also increase the degree of isolation, it will result in larger
circuit size. In Section II, a theory required for developing dual-
band filters is presented. The design and measured results are
provided in Section III. Section IV will describe the influence
of changing the electric lengths. The conclusions are given in
Section V.
II. DESIGN THEORY
Fig. 3 shows the architecture of the proposed dual-band band-
pass filter. The main structure of this dual-band bandpass filter
is composed of an asymmetrical short-circuit coupled line, two
open-stub lines, and two reactances ( and ). Each line of
the coupled line is connected to one end of the opposite direction
to ground. Both the open-stub line and reactance are shunted to
each side of the input and output ports.
A. Coupled Transmission Line
The equivalent circuit of the asymmetrical short-circuit cou-
pled line, as shown in Fig. 4(a), is provided by [17]. Using the
impedance inverter, such as in Fig. 4(b), this equivalent circuit
can be transferred more generally. In order to adopt the tech-
nique of the immittance inverter provided in [16], we modify
the transformed circuit with the admittance inverter, as shown
in Fig. 4(c). The even- and odd-mode line admittances and
can then be derived as

where is the corresponding electric length of the asymmet-
rical short-circuit coupled line.
B. Design Procedure
Substituting the transformed circuit of the asymmetrical
short-circuit coupled-line section, as shown in Fig. 4(c), the
equivalent circuit of the proposed dual-band bandpass filter

can be shown as in Fig. 5. Thus, we can apply the immit-
tance inverter [16]–[18] to analyze and design the dual-band
bandpass filter. Compared to the generalized bandpass filter,
the parameters of susceptances and susceptance slopes can be
obtained from

and two capacitances ( and ) are modified as 55 , 59.27
and 55.27 and 0.06 and 0.29 pF, respectively, their responses
can be as shown in Fig. 7 (solid line). The frequencies of the
three transmission zeros can then also be calculated using
(13)–(15) as 8.02, 3.72, and 3.99 GHz.
B. EM Simulation and Measurement
The modularized concept [19] that each part of a circuit can
be designed independently is adopted for the design of the mul-
tilayered dual-band bandpass filter. The proposed modularized
circuit with vertical allocation can reduce the mutual coupling
effects and increase the fabricated yield rate as well.
We utilize the physical model of the circuit simulator to ob-
tain the initial dimension of the coupled line, while it takes too
much time to employ the full-wave EM simulator to design the
whole 3-D structure. Subsequently, the EM simulator is used to
obtain the precise dimension of the rest of the proposed struc-
ture. These circuits are composed of two pairs of the open-stub
line and the shunt-connected capacitor, which are placed on the
upper and lower layers separately to fine tune the return losses
of two passbands.
The multilayered dual-band bandpass filters have been
fabricated with low-temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) tech-
nology [20]–[24] on a substrate of Dupont 951. Its dielectric
constant and loss tangent are 7.8 and 0.0045, respectively.
This LTCC dual-band bandpass filter is designed on four upper
layers with the 1.57-mil sheet, six middle layers with the
3.6-mil sheet, four following layers with the 1.57-mil sheet,
and two lowest layers with the 3.6-mil sheet. Fig. 8(a) and
(b) shows the 3-D architecture and photograph of the modi-
fied dual-band bandpass filter with the overall circuit size of
120 mil 100 mil 41.4 mil.

ferent lengths, as indicated in Fig. 7. Two capacitors and

are inserted at the ends of the input and output ports, as shown

The LTCC dual-band bandpass filter was designed and mea-
sured at the two frequency bands of 2.4 and 5.2 GHz. In the real-
ization of the physical 3-D circuit, the parasitic effect among ca-
pacitors may cause their model to be slightly different from the
ideal values provided by the circuit simulator. The agreement
between experimental and theoretical results shows the feasi-
bility of the proposed filter.

III. DESIGN OF COMPACT BRANCH-LINE COUPLERS
The center frequency of 2.4 GHz is employed to design the
miniaturized microstrip branch-line couplers on the Rogers
R04003 substrate in this paper. The substrate's dielectric
constant, loss tangent, and dielectric thickness are 3.38,
0.0027, and 0.508 mm, respectively. As mentioned in Section
II, approaches with the if-model and the T-model are adopted
individually for the shortened quarter-wavelength
transmission lines to realize the miniaturization of microstrip
branch-line couplers. Moreover, shortened quarter-wavelength
transmission lines with high-impedance open stubs make
miniaturized microstrip branch-line couplers more compact.
The approach with the if-model is utilized to quarter-
wavelength transmission lines in the coupler shown in Fig.
4(a). Taking the yield into consideration, 0.2 mm is generally
chosen for the width of the minimum etched lines in the
process ofproducing the printed circuit boards. Moreover, 115
Q is the impedance corresponding to the width of the
minimum etched lines on the substrate of Rogers R04003.
Substituting 115 Q into (1) and (2), the electric length of four
shortened quarter-wavelength transmission lines is obtained as
25.770. Then, the reduction rate of the minimum size of
branch-line coupler will be 91.8% of that of the conventional
branch-line coupler. However, the closer the open-stub lines in
this coupler are, the narrower the available frequency
