thermal fatigue one while it has an advantage of independently controlling the stress/strain 
and temperature cycles on a specimen under a specified condition.  Temperatures up to 
800
o
C in interconnects are expected at the steady-state operation of a pSOFC system [11].  
According to previous analyses of thermal stress in pSOFCs [7,8], greater thermal stresses are 
found at 25
o
C as compared to those at 800
o
C due to a larger temperature difference from the 
stress-free assembling temperature of a pSOFC stack.  Such a case with the peak (valley) 
stress and valley (peak) temperature present at the same time is classified as an out-of-phase 
TMF cycle.  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of TMF for metallic interconnects is 
needed in design of a reliable pSOFC system. 
 Most of the previous studies on the metallic interconnects developed for pSOFCs were 
focused on electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance, thermal 
properties, Cr evaporation, and long-term stability [4,12-16].  However, studies on 
high-temperature mechanical properties are limited for the metallic interconnect of pSOFC 
[17-20].  High-temperature tensile and creep properties of two newly developed, commercial 
Cr-rich ferritic stainless steels (Crofer 22 APU and Crofer 22 H) for pSOFC interconnects 
have been investigated [17-20].  Ferritic stainless steels with combined additions of Nb, W, 
and Si have a better creep rupture strength [18-20].  Improved tensile strength and creep 
resistance of Nb/W added Crofer 22 H over Crofer 22 APU are attributed to a precipitation 
strengthening effect of fine Laves phase particles [18,20].  However, there is still lack of 
study on the TMF behavior of pSOFC interconnects.  As part of a series of studies on the 
high-temperature mechanical properties of metallic interconnects and glass sealants for 
pSOFCs [17,18,21-24], the TMF properties of the improved Crofer 22 H ferritic steel are 
investigated in the present study.  Out-of-phase TMF tests as well as TMF-creep interaction 
tests under various combinations of mechanical loadings at a cyclic temperature range 
between 25
o
C and 800
o
C are conducted to study the long-term durability of the newly 
developed Crofer 22 H alloy for applications in pSOFC. 
 
2. Experimental Procedures 
 
2.1. Material and specimen 
 
 The material used in the current study is a commercially available Crofer 22 H ferritic 
stainless steel supplied by the vendor in the form of cold-rolled, annealed plates with a 
thickness of 2.5 mm.  The chemical composition, given in weight percent, of this steel is 
 6 
similar to those without a hold time.  The hold time was performed immediately after the 
minimum mechanical loading and maximum temperature were reached at each cycle, as 
shown in Fig. 1(b).  As shown in Fig. 1, each TMF test started at the minimum stress with a 
maximum temperature of 800
o
C.  Note that the temperature, mechanical load, and actuator 
displacement of testing machine were recorded. 
 The procedure adopted in the TMF tests of this study is somewhat different from that in 
Refs. [25,26].  The cyclic mechanical loading is applied under force control in replacement 
of strain control used in Refs. [25,26].  The TMF specimen was initially allowed to expand 
under zero load during initial heating from 25
o
C to 800
o
C.  Such a specimen can be regarded 
as stress-free at a temperature in assembling the SOFC stack before starting the TMF test.  
The specified mechanical loads along with the temperature change were then applied to 
simulate the different levels of thermal stresses caused by CTE mismatch at 800
o
C and 25
o
C. 
 
2.3. Microstructural and fractography analyses 
 
 After the TMF tests, fracture surfaces of the specimens were examined with scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM).  In addition, some of the TMF specimens were cut axially along 
the loading axis, ground, and polished for metallographic preparation and observation.  The 
microstructural change and TMF damages were then characterized and analyzed using a 
Hitachi SEM (Model 3500N) with secondary electrons of an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. 
 
3. Results and Discussion  
 
3.1 Thermo-mechanical fatigue behavior without hold time 
 
 Table 2 lists the number of cycles to failure for Crofer 22 H steel subjected to various 
TMF loadings between 25
o
C and 800
o
C.  Figure 2 shows the relationship between TMF life 
and YSR at 800
o
C for various YSRs at 25
o
C.  As shown in Fig. 2, the relationship between 
TMF life and YSR at 800
o
C in a semi-log scale is well described by a linear curve for all the 
given YSRs at 25
o
C.  The number of cycles to failure is increased with a decrease in YSR at 
800
o
C, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2.  The TMF life for a given YSR at 800
o
C is almost 
independent of YSR at 25
o
C.  It indicates that the TMF life is dominated by the applied 
stress at 800
o
C rather than by the applied stress at 25
o
C.

the creep rupture times given by these five equations.  The creep damage ratio for each given 
TMF loading cycle is then obtained through a time integration of the creep damage fraction 
with the variation of a combined stress/temperature level at 650
o
C-800
o
C during the TMF 
loading cycle.  The total creep damage ratio for each given TMF test is then obtained by 
multiplying the number of cycles to failure by the creep damage ratio per cycle.  The 
calculation equation of the creep damage ratio is given as follows:   
 
0
TMFt
c f
r
dt
D N
t
    (6) 
where Dc is the total creep damage ratio, Nf is the number of cycles to failure, and tTMF is the 
time interval at 650
o
C-800
o
C for each given TMF loading cycle.  Table 3 lists the total creep 
damage ratio for various TMF loadings.  As shown in Table 3, the values of creep damage 
ratio for all the given TMF loadings are far less than 1.  This means that the creep effect does 
not play an important role in determining the TMF life of a test without hold time.  In this 
regard, the fatigue effect is the controlling mechanism for the non-hold-time TMF damages. 
 The TMF life is increased with a decrease in YSR at 800
o
C, as shown in Fig. 2.  
Figure 4 shows the variation of displacement with applied force for (0.6, 0.5) and (0.6, 0.2) 
TMF loadings.  Note that the number of cycles to failure for (0.6, 0.5) and (0.6, 0.2) is 6 and 
64, respectively, and only selected cycles are presented for the (0.6, 0.2) TMF loading in Fig. 
4.  As shown in Fig. 4, in each TMF loading cycle the displacement is increased as the 
maximum force (at room temperature) is decreased to the minimum force (at 800
o
C).  A 
hysteresis loop is also found for each cycle indicating an inelastic response of the given steel 
to the applied TMF loading.  The area within the loop can be regarded as a measure of the 
plastic deformation work done on the specimen.  Accordingly, a (0.6, 0.5) TMF loading 
generated a larger amount of cyclic plastic deformation than did a (0.6, 0.2) one.  In addition, 
the cyclic force-displacement curves shift to the right (or called ratchetting) indicating an 
accumulation of plastic deformation in each given TMF loading. Such an accumulation of 
plastic deformation resulted in a failure somewhat similar to that in a tension test, when the 
displacement reached a certain value.  The comparison of (0.6, 0.5) and (0.6, 0.2) TMF 
loadings given in Fig. 4 indicates that cyclic plastic deformation induced by the 
high-temperature softening effect is decreased when the applied mechanical loading at 800
o
C 
was reduced from a YSR of 0.5 to 0.2.  Such a reduction of cyclic plastic deformation leads 
to an increase in number of cycles to failure.  Therefore, the increase in TMF life with 
 10 
specimen deformation with applied temperature is partially caused by the aforementioned 
high-temperature softening effect.  As shown in Fig. 5, during the hold-time period at 800
o
C, 
the specimen deformation is continuously increased, apparently due to a creep effect.  With a 
greater creep damage ratio for this given hold-time TMF loading, creep mechanism indeed 
makes certain contributions to the specimen deformation during a loading cycle.  Therefore, 
both high-temperature softening plastic deformation and creep contribute to the damage in 
TMF loadings with a hold time at 800
o
C. 
 
3.3 Thermo-mechanical fatigue life and damage analyses 
 
 As shown in Fig. 2, the relation between the non-hold-time TMF life and YSR at 800
o
C 
for all YSRs at 25
o
C follows a logarithmic function.  The fitted equation and correlation 
coefficient for all data points shown in Fig. 2 are given as follows: 
 YSR800 = -0.111 ln(Nf) + 0.688,  r
2
 = 0.95 (7) 
where YSR800 is the YSR at 800
o
C and r is the correlation coefficient for the fitted curve.  
The high value of correlation coefficient indicates that the non-hold-time TMF life for the 
Crofer 22 H steel can be predicted through the logarithmic function. 
 Figure 6 shows the relationship between the non-hold-time TMF life and applied stress 
range for various YSRs at 25
o
C.  As shown in Fig. 6, TMF life is increased with stress range 
for a given YSR at 25
o
C.  The variation of TMF life with stress range for such a steel for 
each given YSR at 25
o
C can also be described by a logarithmic function.  Note that, for a 
YSR of 0.5, there are only two points used for curve fitting.  The fitted equations and 
associated correlation coefficients for each YSR at 25
o
C in Fig. 6 are given as follows: 
YSR of 0.6 at 25
o
C: r = 16.1 ln(Nf) + 156,  r
2
 = 0.98 (8) 
YSR of 0.5 at 25
o
C: r = 15.2 ln(Nf) + 119,  r
2
 = 1.0 (9) 
YSR of 0.4 at 25
o
C: r = 12.0 ln(Nf) + 82.9,  r
2
 = 0.99 (10) 
YSR of 0.2 at 25
o
C: r = 12.9 ln(Nf) – 2.90,  r
2
 = 0.96 (11) 
where r is the applied stress range in unit of MPa.  The non-hold-time TMF life of Crofer 
22 H for a given YSR at 25
o
C can thus be estimated through these logarithmic functions once 
the stress range is known. 
 As described in Section 2.2, the apparent YSR for each TMF test was determined based 
on the tensile yield strength under a displacement rate of 2 mm min
-1
.  However, the true 
 12 
and alloy under a hold-time TMF loading involves a creep-fatigue interaction mechanism 
[25,26].  Therefore, it is suggested that a creep-fatigue interaction mechanism is involved in 
each given hold-time TMF loading in the current study.  Damage ratio for such a 
creep-fatigue interaction effect is estimated by means of a linear cumulative damage rule 
through the following equation: 
 Df + Dc + Dfc = 1 (11) 
where Dfc is the damage ratio of creep-fatigue interaction for a given hold-time TMF case.  
Accordingly, the damage ratio of creep-fatigue interaction for each hold-time TMF loading is 
readily obtained by subtracting from unity a sum of the fatigue and creep damage ratios 
(Table 5).  As shown in Tables 4 and 5, a greater creep-fatigue interaction damage ratio 
resulted in a shorter hold-time TMF life.  As also shown in Tables 4 and 5, the contribution 
of creep to the damage in a hold-time TMF loading is increased with a decrease in YSR at 
800
o
C (e.g. from 0.3 to 0.2) and an increase in number of cycles to failure.  In addition, the 
lifetime of a hold-time TMF test is significantly shorter than the expected, pure creep lifetime 
following the relations in Eqs. (4) and (5) for a similar constant loading during the hold-time 
period.  This is due to a creep-fatigue interaction effect.  Therefore, the hold-time TMF life 
for YSRs of 0.2 and 0.3 at 800
o
C varies with extent of influence of creep and creep-fatigue 
interaction mechanisms.  As the hold time for a long-term steady operation of a pSOFC 
system is generally greater than 100 h and even over 1000 h, it is expected that the influence 
of creep on the hold-time TMF damage would be more significant for practical applications of 
the given interconnect steel.  Creep properties of such ferritic stainless steels (Crofer 22 H 
and Crofer 22 APU) for use as an interconnect material in pSOFCs have been fully 
investigated in previous studies [17,18]. 
 
3.4 Microstructural and fractography analyses 
 
 SEM micrographs of the fracture surface of a Crofer 22 H specimen after a 
non-hold-time TMF test with a (0.5, 0.4) loading are shown in Fig. 7.  A fractured, 
cross-sectional area with significant necking is observed in Fig. 7(a).  Such a significant 
reduction of cross-sectional area is attributed to a high-temperature softening effect.  As 
shown in Fig. 7(b), a ductile fracture mode is identified by the dimpled patterns at a high 
magnification.  Most of the non-hold-time TMF fracture surfaces for high YSRs at 800
o
C are 
characterized by such a facture pattern due to their extremely short TMF life (< 35 cycles).  
 14 
and a much smaller number of cycles to failure than would be expected from the 
algebraic sum of the individual effects of fatigue and creep. 
(4) The creep and creep-fatigue interaction are the two controlling effects involved in the 
hold-time TMF damage of Crofer 22 H steels.  The contribution of creep to the damage 
in a hold-time TMF loading is increased with a decrease in applied stress at 800
o
C and 
an increase in number of cycles to failure. 
(5) Both ductile, dimpled fracture and fatigue cracking patterns are identified for the Crofer 
22 H specimens after a non-hold-time TMF test with a longer TMF life (> 35 cycles).  
The fracture mode of the non-hold-time TMF behavior is basically controlled by cyclic 
plastic deformation.  Coalescence of creep cavities is found along the grain boundaries 
after a hold-time TMF test.

SOFC Interconnect Steel

Abstract  
 
Metallic interconnects in planar solid oxide fuel cells (pSOFCs) are subjected to cyclic 
thermal stresses due to thermal mismatch during start-up, steady operation, and shutdown 
stages.  Interconnects under cyclic mechanical and thermal loadings could suffer a 
thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) damage during operation of a pSOFC.  The purpose of 
this study is to investigate the thermo-mechanical fatigue behavior of a newly developed 
ferritic stainless steel (Crofer 22 H) for use as an interconnect material in pSOFCs.  TMF 
tests under various combinations of cyclic mechanical and thermal loadings are conducted 
in air at a temperature range of 25oC-800oC.  To simulate various combinations of thermal 
stresses generated in interconnects of a pSOFC stack, cyclic mechanical loading in the 
TMF tests is applied with a peak load at 25oC and a valley load at 800oC.  To study the 
effect of constant, thermal stress at the steady operation stage on the long-term durability 
of a metallic interconnect, a hold time of 100 h of constant mechanical loading is 
additionally applied at 800oC in each cycle for some TMF tests.  Experimental results 
show the number of cycles to failure for non-hold-time TMF loading is decreased with an 
increase in the minimum stress applied at 800oC and barely dependent on the maximum 
stress applied at 25oC.  The non-hold-time TMF life is mainly dominated by a fatigue 
mechanism involving cyclic high-temperature softening plastic deformation.  The relation 
between TMF life and the applied stress at 800oC for all given loading combinations is 
well described by a logarithmic function.  A hold-time of 100 h for the minimum stress 
applied at 800oC causes a significant drop of number of cycles to failure due to a 
synergistic action of fatigue and creep.  Creep and creep-fatigue interaction mechanisms 
are the two primary contributors to the hold-time TMF damage.  The creep damage ratio 
in the hold-time TMF damage is increased with a decrease in applied stress at 800oC and 
an increase in number of cycles to failure. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most efficient devices for conversion of 
chemical energy directly into electrical power.  Among the SOFCs developed, planar 
SOFCs (pSOFCs) have a simple structural geometry, lower fabrication cost, and higher 
energy efficiency in comparison with tubular ones [1].  A typical unit cell in a pSOFC 
stack is composed of a positive electrode-electrolyte-negative electrode (PEN) assembly 
plate, a supporting window frame, a porous nickel mesh, two interconnects, and gas seals.  
In the early stage of pSOFC development, thickness of the electrolyte in the 
electrolyte-supported pSOFCs is typically larger than 100 μm.  Electrolytes with a 
thickness of 10 m-20 m in the anode-supported PEN design lead to a remarkable 
decrease in ohmic polarization as compared to the electrolyte-supported configuration [2].  
Over the past years, such a progress has been achieved in reducing the electrolyte thickness, 
 7
mechanical loadings at a cyclic temperature range between 25oC and 800oC are conducted 
to study the long-term durability of the newly developed Crofer 22 H alloy for applications 
in pSOFC. 
 
2. Experimental procedures 
 
2.1 Material and specimen  
 
The material used in the current study is a commercially available Crofer 22 H ferritic 
stainless steel supplied by the vendor in the form of cold-rolled, annealed plates with a 
thickness of 2.5 mm.  The chemical composition, given in weight percent, of this steel is 
listed in Table 1.  From these plates, pin-loaded specimens with a gauge section of 40 mm 
in length and 6 mm in width were manufactured to perform TMF tests.  There is no 
further heat treatment performed on the specimens after machining.  Details of the 
specimen geometry are given elsewhere [17]. 
 
2.2 Out-of-phase TMF test  
 
Two types of out-of-phase TMF test (with or without a hold time) were conducted on a 
commercial closed-loop servo-hydraulic testing machine equipped with a furnace.  For 
TMF tests without a hold time, they were performed under a combination of cyclic thermal 
and mechanical loadings.  A phase angle difference of 180° between the temperature and 
mechanical loading waveforms was applied and the period for each cycle was 190 min, as 
shown in Fig. 1(a).  A minimum (maximum) mechanical load was applied at the 
corresponding maximum (minimum) temperature.  In each cycle, the heating step with 
decreasing mechanical load and the cooling step with increasing mechanical load were set 
as 30 min and 160 min, respectively.  The TMF tests were conducted in air at a cyclic 
temperature range between 25oC and 800oC to simulate the temperature range of pSOFCs 
between shutdown and steady operation stages.  The cyclic mechanical loading was 
applied under force control with specified yield strength ratios (YSRs) at 25oC and 800oC 
to simulate various combinations of thermal stresses generated in interconnects of a 
pSOFC stack.  The tensile yield strength at various temperatures has been determined 
under a displacement rate of 2 mm min-1 in a previous study [18]. 
 
Apparent YSRs of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 were selected as the applied mechanical loads 
at the temperatures of 25oC and 800oC in TMF tests.  In the following, (x, y) is used to 
represent the applied mechanical loading.  x is the YSR corresponding to the peak stress 
applied at room temperature while y is the YSR corresponding to the valley stress applied 
at 800oC.  For example, a (0.2, 0.6) TMF loading represents an applied maximum stress 
of 81.2 MPa with a YSR of 0.2 at 25oC and a minimum stress of 72 MPa with a YSR of 0.6 
at 800oC.  Note the tensile yield strength of Crofer 22 H is of 406 MPa at 25oC and 120 
MPa at 800oC [18].  In this regard, mechanical loads applied at room temperature are 
greater than those at high temperature for all combinations even for a (0.2, 0.6) TMF 
loading.  For TMF tests with a hold time, a hold time of 100 h was additionally applied at 
800oC for selected YSRs of 0.2 and 0.3 to study the effect of constant, thermal stress at the 
steady operation stage of pSOFCs.  The cyclic temperature range and mechanical 
loadings at 25oC in the hold-time tests were similar to those without a hold time.  The 
hold time was performed immediately after the minimum mechanical loading and 
 9
between 650oC and 800oC for each given TMF loading.  The previously obtained 
stress-time relations for creep rupture of Crofer 22 H alloy at 650oC, 700oC, 750oC, and 
800oC are given below [18]:   
 
650oC:                             tr0.07 = 171                          (1) 
 
700oC:                             tr0.08 = 126                          (2) 
 
750oC:                             tr0.11 = 113                          (3) 
 
800oC ( ≧ 45 MPa):                 tr0.13 = 82.6                         (4) 
  
800oC ( ＜ 45 MPa):                tr0.37 = 281                          (5)
   
where  is the applied stress in unit of MPa, tr is the time to rupture in unit of h.  The 
creep rupture time for a given stress at a temperature of 650oC-800oC is estimated by 
interpolating the creep rupture times given by these five equations.  The creep damage 
ratio for each given TMF loading cycle is then obtained through a time integration of the 
creep damage fraction with the variation of a combined stress/temperature level at 
650oC-800oC during the TMF loading cycle.  The total creep damage ratio for each given 
TMF test is then obtained by multiplying the number of cycles to failure by the creep 
damage ratio per cycle.  The calculation equation of the creep damage ratio is given as 
follows:

where Dc is the total creep damage ratio, Nf is the number of cycles to failure, and tTMF is 
the time interval at 650oC-800oC for each given TMF loading cycle.  Table 3 lists the total 
creep damage ratio for various TMF loadings.  As shown in Table 3, the values of creep 
damage ratio for all the given TMF loadings are far less than 1.  This means that the creep 
effect does not play an important role in determining the TMF life of a test without hold 
time.  In this regard, the fatigue effect is the controlling mechanism for the non-hold-time 
TMF damages.   
 
3.2 Thermo-mechanical fatigue behavior with a hold time 
 
Interconnects should exhibit adequate high-temperature mechanical strength and creep 
resistance.  This requirement is of particular importance to a pSOFC stack since 
interconnects serve as a structural support during a long-term, high-temperature steady 
operation of a pSOFC system.  Therefore, creep properties of the Crofer 22 APU and 
Crofer 22 H alloys for SOFC interconnects have been characterized in previous studies 
[17,18].  In addition to the steady operation stage, interconnects are also subjected to 
cyclic thermal stresses during operation between start-up and shutdown stages.  The 
fatigue damage of Crofer 22 H under TMF loading without hold time has been discussed in 
the previous section.  However, repeated cycles of start-up, steady operation, and 
shutdown are expected to take place in practical applications of a pSOFC system.

where Df is the fatigue damage ratio, Nh is the number of cycles to failure for a given 
hold-time TMF loading, and Nn is the number of cycles to failure for the corresponding 
non-hold-time TMF case.  Therefore, the fatigue damage ratio for each hold-time case is 
calculated using the number of cycles to failure in Table 4 divided by the corresponding 
one of the non-hold-time TMF case (Table 2) with a similar combination of peak/valley 
loading.  As listed in Table 5, the fatigue damage ratio for each hold-time TMF loading is 
in the range of 0.03-0.05 indicating a very small effect of pure fatigue mechanism.  In 
addition, a sum of fatigue and creep damage ratios (Table 5) for each given TMF test with 
a hold time still has a value less than unity.  A synergistic action of fatigue and creep 
apparently generates more damages than would be expected from the algebraic sum of the 
individual effects of fatigue and creep in the present study.  It has been reported that the 
final fracture of a ferritic steel and alloy under a hold-time TMF loading involves a 
creep-fatigue interaction mechanism [25,26].  Therefore, it is suggested that a 
creep-fatigue interaction mechanism is involved in each given hold-time TMF loading in 
the current study.  Damage ratio for such a creep-fatigue interaction effect is estimated by 
means of a linear cumulative damage rule through the following equation:   
 
Df + Dc + Dfc = 1                                                         (9) 
 
where Dfc is the damage ratio of creep-fatigue interaction for a given hold-time TMF case.  
Accordingly, the damage ratio of creep-fatigue interaction for each hold-time TMF loading 
is readily obtained by subtracting from unity a sum of the fatigue and creep damage ratios 
(Table 5).  As shown in Tables 4 and 5, a greater creep-fatigue interaction damage ratio 
resulted in a shorter hold-time TMF life.  As also shown in Tables 4 and 5, the 
contribution of creep to the damage in a hold-time TMF loading is increased with a 
decrease in YSR at 800oC (e.g. from 0.3 to 0.2) and an increase in number of cycles to 
failure.  In addition, the lifetime of a hold-time TMF test is significantly shorter than the 
expected, pure creep lifetime following the relations in Eqs. (4) and (5) for a similar 
constant loading during the hold-time period.  This is due to a creep-fatigue interaction 
effect.  Therefore, the hold-time TMF life for YSRs of 0.2 and 0.3 at 800oC varies with 
extent of influence of creep and creep-fatigue interaction mechanisms.  As the hold time 
for a long-term steady operation of a pSOFC system is generally greater than 100 h and 
even over 1000 h, it is expected that the influence of creep on the hold-time TMF damage 
would be more significant for practical applications of the given interconnect steel.  Creep 
properties of such ferritic stainless steels (Crofer 22 H and Crofer 22 APU) for use as an 
interconnect material in pSOFCs have been fully investigated in previous studies [17,18]. 
 
4. Conclusions  
 
1. A fatigue mechanism involving cyclic plastic deformation plays an important role in 
influencing the non-hold-time TMF life of Crofer 22 H steels.  A greater extent of 
cyclic high-temperature softening plastic deformation results in a smaller number of 
cycles to failure. 
2. The number of cycles to failure for non-hold-time TMF loading is increased with a 
decrease in applied stress at high temperature.  However, for a given applied stress at
