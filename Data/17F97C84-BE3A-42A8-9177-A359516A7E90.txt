Abstract 
 
Friction stir processing (FSP) is applied to produce aluminum matrix composites 
(Al-Al2O3, Al-Zn, and Al-Zn-Al2O3) with various grain sizes. The microstructures and 
of composites were characterized by the used of SEM and TEM. Tensile tests were 
performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of these composites. The mechanisms 
of microstructure evolution during tensile deformation in these composites are 
discussed. 
In the Al-Al2O3 system, a new way to is developed to engineering nano-scale 
alumina dispersoids homogeneously into pure aluminum by FSP. It was found that the 
nano-scale alumina made it very effective in accumulating dislocations during 
deformation, leading to simultaneous increase in strength , work hardening ability and 
ductility. 
In the Al-Zn system, the pronounced beneficial effect of Zn addition on tensile 
strength and ductility of ultrafine grained (ufg) aluminum alloy prepared by FSP is 
investigated. Experimental evidence suggests that increasing Zn content from 0 to 
15wt% can enhance the total elongation as a result of increased work hardening rate in 
the initial tensile stage, the uniform spreading of the fine slip bands all over the gauge 
length and the contribution of grain boundary sliding (GBS).  
In the Al-Zn-Al2O3 system, the improvement of both tensile strength and ductility of 
ufg Al materials by the simultaneously incorporation of with highly dispersed 
nano-scaled alumina, solute atoms and uniformly distributed G-P zones, resulting in 
enhancing the uniform elongation and strength significantly, as compared with ufg 
Al-Al2O3 composites. In addition, the relaxed and dislocation-free boundaries were 
observed due to high GB diffusion assisted annihilation of GB dislocations even 
though the existence of resistance Al2O3 particles on boundaries during the deformation, 
which in turn lead to a decrease in ek . However, it may be surmised a pronounced work 
hardening rate within grain can be maintained as a result of sliding-resistance of 
nano-scale alumina even when the relaxed and dislocation-free boundaries was still 
occurred

Indeed, very recently a new strategy to improve the ductility for ufg materials was 
proposed based on the concept that by the grain boundary sliding （GBS）except for 
the mechanism of dislocation slip and twinning. Hirata et al. [22] has reported that 
Zn-22wt% Al alloys with fine grains exhibit high ductility and the dominant 
deformation mechanism at room temperature is GBS. Sabirov et al. [23] has reported 
that Aluminum alloy 6082 was subjected to equal-channel angular pressing（ECAP）, 
which resulted in an ufg microstructure. The high elongations improved to the 
phenomenon correlates with a high incidence of microshear banding with evidence of 
GBS.  
1.2. Scope of Thesis and Objectives 
The low ductility of ufg materials is attributed to the lack of work hardening caused 
by their inability to accumulate dislocations because of their small grain sizes and 
saturation of dislocation [7-8]. Therefore, the basic idea to improve the uniform 
ductility of ufg is to regain the work hardening (dislocation accumulation capability), 
which is often accompanied with sacrifice of strength. This raises a question: Is it 
possible to design ufg materials that have both high strength and good ductility?  
Based on previous studies, friction stir processing (FSP) has been demonstrated to 
be an effective grain refinement technique for Al alloys [24]. Also, FSP has been 
shown to be a successful method in fabricating bulk ultrafine grained metallic 
composites with different percentages of strengthening phase [25-26]. There are three 
material system, using Al-Al2O3, Al-Zn-Al2O3 and Al-Zn, as model materials, were 
studied. Based on three material systems, two goals in this research were to 
accomplish. One is to present a strategy to improve the uniform ductility to rather 
high levels while simultaneously enhancing the strength. The other one is to establish 
the basic understanding of the evolution of deformed mechanism with various grain 
sizes for these system and to clarify the effect of Zn content dissolved in these 
material systems, as well as of the structural and mechanical characteristics.  
At Al-Al2O3 system, to explore the microstructure evolution and mechanical 
behavior of nanoscale Al/ Al2O3 materials, a nanoscale Al2O3 particle reinforced Al 
matrix composite material, produced by FSP, is investigated. The resulting ufg 
composite exhibits significant work hardening and thus enhanced uniform ductility 
during uniaxial tensile testing at room temperature. In the meantime, the strength level 
is also increased due to dispersion hardening. In general, it is efficient to enhance the 
uniform elongation by adding a great amount of the strengthening phase,  
unfortunately, resulted in excessively strong work hardening rate and strength and 
disappointing low uniform ductility. 
Based on the problem of disappointing low ductility, a new strategy is developed in 
this study, in an attempt to increase simultaneously the strength, uniform elongation 
and total elongation of the Al-Zn-Al2O3 composites by preparing the materials with (i) 
ultrafine-grained grain structures, (ii) uniformly distributed intrinsically precipitated 
GP zones and solute atoms, and (iii) uniformly dispersed extrinsically incorporated 
nano-scaled alumina particles. The mechanical properties of such ufg Al-Zn-Al2O3 
composites are evaluated in this paper.  
Furthermore, on the Al-Zn-Al2O3 system, although the strength and uniform were 
improved, an unusual phenomena on Hall-Petch relation were observed, which is 
strongly depended on the Zn content dissolved into Al matrix. Therefore, it is

Chapter 2  Literature Review 
2.1 Mechanical Properties of ufg and/or nc Metals and Alloys 
   The mechanical behavior of ufg and nc materials is characterized primarily by 
ultra-high strength and limited ductility. The following sections will discuss these 
two properties respectively. 
2.1.1 Ultra-High Strength 
  It has long been observed experimentally in conventional metallic materials that 
the yield stress or hardness increase with the inverse square root of the grain size, as 
expressed by well-known Hall-Petch (H-P) relation ( 1/ 2y o kdσ σ
−= + ) [34-35], where 
d is the mean grain size (varying from 1 mm down to 1 m), oσ is the friction stress 
require to move individual dislocations in cg reference material, and k a 
material-dependent intensity factor related to the hardening of GBs. The parameter k 
is often called the H-P slope [36]. The H-P relationship (1) has been successfully 
interpreted by dislocation theories and two models have been developed based on the 
concepts that (a) GBs acts as barriers to dislocation motion, forming dislocation 
pile-ups against grain boundaries [36-37] and (b) dislocations are generated at grain 
boundary ledges, forming a forest near the GBs [38]. These two models have been 
extensively reviewed by Li and Chou [36]. Furthermore, it has strongly stimulated 
research aiming at processing structures with smaller and smaller grain sizes. 
However, attempts which have been done so far to rationalize the results of the 
measurements made on nanometric grain sized materials, equivalently nanocrystals, 
on the basic of the H-P relation have produced inconsistent results. 
With the advent of ufg and nc material whose grain size are of nanometer (nm) 
dimensions, the applicability and validity of H-P relation becomes of interest because 
the classic Hall-Petch relationship is almost always obeyed in ductile metals. Three 
kinds of characteristics of H-P slope were observed. First, at even smaller grain sizes 
(typically below 20 nm), there is experimental evidence indicating that strength may 
decrease with further grain refinement in a “negative Hall-Petch effect” [39-42]. 
Chokshi et al. [39] were the first to report the negative H-P effect by performing 
measurement on nanocrystalline Cu and Pd samples made by inert gas condensation 
(IGC). Both metals exhibited that negative slopes were obtained in the plots of 
hardness vs. grain size as shown in Fig. 2-1. Table 2-1 gives a partial list of 
publications on the phenomenon of inverse H-P. Second, H-P slop approach almost 
zero as shown in Fig. 2-2. Table 2-1 gives a partial list of publications on the 
phenomenon of inverse Hall-Petch [39,43-67]. Thompson [68] used electroplating to 
manufacture tensile specimens of Ni with different grain size (0.12~130 m). It 
should be noticed that a weak dependence of yield stress on grain size was reported 
for grain size below 1 m. Furukawa et al. [42] show an Al-3%Mg alloy subjected to 
intense plastic deformation by torsion straining and a grain size range of 0.09 to 100 
μm was resulted. A decreasing slope in H-P relation was observed in this Al-3%Mg 
alloy with grain size smaller than 0.15 μm as shown in Fig 2-3. Therefore, the validity 
of the deviation from Hall-Petch effect itself is a subject of controversy. Fig. 2-4 
shows the H-P plot for copper taken from different sources where the yield stress data 
are available over a wide range of grain size. As can be clearly seen, there is 
ambiguity in the tread of the plot, as the grain size falls down to a value below ~25nm.

boundary directly without intersecting other dislocations. The observation of 
macroscopic chisel-tip fracture in electrodeposited nc-Ni [80] and nc-Cu [81-82] 
tensile tests with little tensile elongation to fracture supports the localized deformation 
hypothesis. 
2.2 The Approaches to Improve the Tensile Ductility of High-Strength ufg and nc 
Metals 
The ductility is controlled by two material parameters: work hardening and 
strain-rate sensitivity. High values of these parameters help delay the onset of 
localized deformation (‘necking’) under tensile stress, thus improving ductility. The 
lack of work hardening rate was caused by their inability to accumulate dislocations 
because of their small grain sizes and saturation of dislocations [83]. Therefore, the 
basic idea to improve the ductility of ufg materials is to regain the work hardening 
(dislocation accumulation capability). It is well known that the plastic deformation of 
metallic materials depends upon dislocation slip and twinning as two of the primary 
deformation mechanisms to increase the work hardening rate. Five common strategies 
have been developed to enhance the work hardening rate and then improve tensile 
ductility of ufg materials without sacrificing the strength. 
2.2.1 Grain Size Distribution (Bimodal ultrafine-grained nanostructured metal) 
  The approach of incorporating a predetermined amount of submicron grains into 
nanostructured regions to form bimodal microstructure is rapidly becoming a strategy 
to enhance ductility while retaining high strength [84-89]. Enhanced tensile ductility 
was attributed to the increase of dislocations activity in submicron grains during 
plastic deformation. In other words, while the nc provide strength, the embedded 
larger grains stabilize the tensile deformation of the materials. Jin et al. [90] propose a 
duplex (bimodal) microstructure that can enhance the ductility, without too great a 
sacrifice in strength, in AA 5754 ufg material. Fig.2-6 (a) shows the influence of the 
volume fraction of the ufg component on the yield and UTS of the sheet. The strength 
increases as the concentration of ultra-fine increases, as would be expected on the 
basic Hall-Petch grain size strengthening. However, the UTS converge as the ufg 
content increase, which indicates a decrease in the work hardening component with 
decreasing grain size. Fig 2-6(b) shows the associated tensile elongation that changes 
non-monotonically with the ufg content, and the uniform strain shows exactly the 
same behavior. Therefore, the behavior in regions I and IV is expected, with tensile 
ductility decreasing with increasing strength, but incorporating coarser grains into the 
fine grain structure enhances the ductility. The maximum effect occurs at a coarse 
grain content of 20-45%. Wang et al. [85] proposed a thermomechanical treatment of 
Cu that could result in a bimodal grain size distribution (shown in Fig.2-7, curve C), 
with micrometer-sized grains (at a volume of around 25%) embedded inside a matrix 
of nc and ufc grains. The matrix grains impart high strength, as expected from an 
extrapolation of the Hall-Petch relationship. Meanwhile, the inhomogeneous 
microstructure induces hardening mechanisms that stabilized the tensile deformation, 
leading to a high tensile ductility-65% elongation to failure, and 30% uniform 
elongation. This, however, inevitably lowers slightly the strength of the otherwise 
nanocrystalline or ufg materials (compared with curve B and curve C in Fig. 2-7). 
Other evidence for the importance of grain size distribution comes from the studies of 
the plastic deformation in ufc and nc Zn [91-92].  
 8 
2.2.4 Twinning 
Twin boundaries (TBs), a special kind of coherent boundary, may also be effective 
in blocking dislocation motions, similar to conventional GBs [107]. As the grain size 
decreases, dislocation annihilation is facilitated with more dislocation–GB 
interactions. At a certain grain size (usually in the submicrometer scale), where 
dislocation annihilation rates are high enough to balance the dislocation manipulation, 
no more dislocation boundaries can be formed, and grains tend to a saturation size 
with extended straining. In other words, dislocations generated are not stable enough 
to form dislocation boundary inside small grains owing to the strong dislocation-GB 
interaction. Therefore, the grain size limit (nc or ufg) is intrinsically determined by 
the dislocations-GB interaction so that in order to reduce the saturation grain size, one 
has to weaken the dislocation-GB interactions to stabilize dislocations inside small 
grains. Reducing GB energy seems to be the only option. Twin boundaries (TBs), a 
special type of low-energy boundaries, provide a possible approach for this purpose. 
Shen et al. [108] reported an eletro-deposited Cu sample with a high density of 
nano-scale growth twins (GTBs) shows an ultrahigh tensile strength (~1 GPa) with a 
considerable plastic strain (>13%). Figure 2-11 shows the plot of mechanical response 
of Cu sample with nanotwins in comparison with that for a cg and nc sample. With an 
increase of TB density, both the strength and the ductility increase significantly. In 
other words, the strength and the ductility increase considerably with increasing TB 
density, indicating coherent TBs behave more or less like GBs in acting as obstacles 
to plastic deformation. Zhao et al. [109] demonstrate the occurrence of simultaneous 
improvements in the ductility and strength of ufg materials by introducing 
pre-existing deformation twins (PDTs) which are effective in blocking and storing 
dislocations to give an improvement in the strain hardening rate. Computer simulation 
of deformation of nanocrystalline Al with a grain size of 45 nm [110] have shown that 
twinning occurs after approximately 12% plastic strain and a stress level of 2.5 GPa, 
with twins originating at GBs as well as in the grain interior, the latter resulting from 
the interactions of stacking faults. 
2.2.5 Strain Rate Controlled 
  Li et al. observed [111], as shown Fig 2-12, in which the stress-strain curves for ufg 
Al specimens with 5 ARB passes measured at different deformation rates, varying 
from 15101 −−× s to 13105 −−× s , are plotted, a very pronounced dependence of the 
elongation to failure on the deformation rate is found. For comparison, the 
corresponding curves for the cold-rolled materials for deformation rates of 
15101 −−× s to 14101 −−× s are also displayed. It is obvious that as the deformation rates 
decreases the elongation to failure increases significantly and necking occurs only at 
the very end of the rest. However, for the strain rate 15101 −−× s it is evident that work 
hardening at the beginning. The possible deformation explanation is as follows: The 
GBs in ufg as well as in nanocrystalline materials will as very effective sources and 
sinks for dislocations. Due to the relatively small grain size, reactions between mobile 
dislocations and grain boundary dislocations are very likely to occur. It is understood 
in terms of the thermally activated absorption of dislocations at large-angle GBs 
making the GBs more and more transparent to dislocation asε falls and T rises. In 
other word, thermally activated annihilation processes in the GBs, which are still 
active at relatively low temperatures, might therefore play decisive role for the 
increasing ductility as the deformation rate decreases, although the homologous 
temperature are rather low. Lu et al. [112] observed an abnormal strain rate effect on 
 10 
(Figure 2-17b [117]), and was suggested as an alternate deformation mode at this 
range of grain size.  
With further grain refinement, the yield stress peaks in many cases at an average 
grain size value on the order of 10 nm or so. Further decrease in grain size can cause 
obvious weakening of the metal. The decrease of flow stress is attributed to the 
approach to the amorphous state because of the increase of grain boundary density 
and/or the activation of plastic instability in triple points which lead eventually to 
fracture. This decrease is also considered to be caused by the introduction of 
processing defects in nc materials.  
  Despite the extensive work on synthesis of nc materials, there are few reported data 
on room temperature monotonic stress-strain response of bulk nc materials [9, 11, 86, 
118-128] mostly because of the difficulty of obtaining large enough specimens with 
full density. Compression experiments conducted by Youngdahl et al. [129] showed a 
strong correlation between the strength and the porosity content in compacted nc Cu 
and Pd. The use of miniature specimens for mechanical testing [130] demonstrated 
that specimens with very few processing flaws have very high yield strength levels 
and reasonable strength levels and reasonable ductility as compared to large 
specimens, indicating the importance of processing flaws on resulting properties. The 
same study [130] suggested that the GBS mechanism does not contribute significantly 
to the room temperature deformation of 25-50 nm grain size Cu. It has also been 
reported [124] that deformation mechanisms in nc copper (25-55 nm grain size) are 
dominated by dislocation activity because work hardening was observed during 
compression. The dominance of dislocation activity over grain boundary moderated 
mechanisms during deformation has been clearly illustrated by a recent excellent 
review and in-situ TEM experiments by Kumar et al. [131] in Ni down to grain size of 
20-30 nm. Moreover, an in-situ tensile experiment of nc copper specimens (grain size 
ranged form 20-500 nm) produced by inert gas condensation [132] confirmed the 
presence of parallel dislocation arrays in larger grains (~100 nm) and that deformation 
is governed by dislocation activity down to a grain size of 30 nm. On the other hand, 
molecular dynamic simulation of nc Cu showed that large plastic deformation can be 
accommodated by GBS in samples with grain size less than 20 nm [133-134], but no 
experimental data deformed at room temperature has yet been obtained to confirm this 
theory. In summary, the above discussion shows the necessity of a systematic and 
thorough study to clarify some of the controversies related to the deformation 
mechanisms and microstructural evolution in nc material. 
  Furthermore, earlier works on deformation mechanism in nc materials [52,118-121, 
135-137] argued that dislocation and grain boundary mechanisms such as GBS and 
Coble creep can simultaneously interplay or the latter is the governing mechanism 
below a certain grain size, such as 70 nm in Cu. However, more recently convincing 
experimental evidence [11,131,138] demonstrated that down to about 20 nm grain 
size, dislocations are still operative. Although some studies [119-120,135] have 
attributed certain findings such as high strain rate sensitivity to GBS, it appears that 
there is not any direct experimental evidence showing grain boundary moderated 
mechanism in nc materials. 
2.4 Structure and Phase Transformation in Al-Zn Alloys 
  The microstructure, physical and chemical properties of the Al-Zn system, with 
respect to the composition and applied heat treatment, have been studied by many 
 12 
Chapter 3  Experimental Procedure 
3.1 Initial Powder 
  The starting materials used were commercial pure Al powders (99.7% purity, 325 
mesh), Zn powders (99.5% purity, 325 mesh) and alumina powders (99.9% purity, 
~30 nm). The aluminum powder was produced by ECKA-Granules Company in 
Australia. The Zn powder and alumina powder were produced by EIECMAT in 
America and TAM Ceramics in USA, respectively. 
3.2 Specimen Preparation 
  Powders of alloying element were premixed with aluminum powder in a horizontal 
rotating container. Each batch of powder mixture was milled at 96 rpm for 24 hr in a 
sealed air atmosphere. The premixed alloying powders were cold compacted to small 
billet (12 20 140× × mm) in a steel die by using a pressure of 225 MPa. The assembled 
die set is shown in Fig 3-1. For the FSPed procedures (shown in Fig 3-2), at first, 
large pin (the diameters of the shoulder and probe of the tool were 16 and 6 mm, 
respectively) and high spindle rotation speed (1500 rpm) were employed to produce 
densely large cross section bulk material. Then, the smaller diameters of the shoulder 
and probe of the tool and lower spindle rotation speed were used to produce different 
refined grain size. Importantly, the processed samples and fixture have to be cooled 
down to room temperature when one processing operation parameter was changed 
into others. Different alloying component content, processing parameters, and 
different pin sizes were used to produce various grain sizes via the current FSP, as 
summarized in Table 3-1. The tool pin used is made of SKH9 tool steel, and the tilt 
angle was maintained at approximately 3°. The tensile specimen was machined from 
the FSP billet with the tensile axis perpendicular to the FSP traveling direction. 
3.3 Microscopy 
3.3.1 Scanning electron microscopy 
  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to obtain quantitative grain size 
information of Al-Zn system. FSPed samples were sectioned by a Struers Minitom 
diamond saw cutting perpendicular to the tool traversing direction. Then the samples 
were ground using waterproof of SiC paper (grades P100, P400, P800, P1000, P1200, 
P2000 and P2400) and diamond pastes to metallographic finishing. Then, the grain 
boundaries of Al-Zn samples were etched by Gatan Model 683 Met-Etch Ion- Polisher 
and then examined by scanning electron microscopy (JSM-6330TF). A computer 
program (Optimas-6.1) was used to determine the grain size and size distribution. For 
each specimen of Al-Zn system, more than 500 grains were measured. 
3.3.2 Transmission electron microscopy 
  To correlate the observed mechanical behaviors with microstructures, we 
performed systematic TEM and HRTEM investigations on samples at different 
processing (before and after tensile testing) to reveal their grain structure, deformation 
evolution and interaction between dislocations and strengthening phases. Specimens 
were prepared by cutting thin slices of about 100 μm that were ground on both sides 
with SiC-paper to a thin foil. The foils were prepared in a Struers twin-jet 
electro-polishing apparatus using a mixture of 25% nitric acid and 75% methanol at 
± 20 oC and 15 V. Further thinning to a thickness of electron transparency was carried

Chapter 4  Results 
4.1 Al-Al2O3 system 
  Oxide particulates reinforced aluminum-based metal matrix composites 
(Al-MMCs), which possess high-specific elastic modulus and strength [141-142], 
have been successfully fabricated by either mechanical alloying (MA) [143-144], 
powder metallurgy (P/M) technique [145-146], casting methods [147-148], reactive 
hot pressing (RHP) [149-150]. However, no one technique can immediately produce 
various grain sizes with uniformly distributed oxide particles in Al-based metal matrix 
composite. In addition, it is true for bulk ufg and nanostructured materials, which 
usually have high strength, but disappointing low ductility. Uniform elongation should 
be used as a measure of the ductility of ufg and nanostructured materials because it is 
much less affected by the gauge length than the elongation to failure. In this work, an 
effective method, FSP [151-152], is developed to simultaneously fabricate various 
grain sizes and uniformly distributed alumina particles in Al-based metal matrix 
composite by incorporating specific pin size and adjusted the processing parameters, 
and then further investigates whether uniform elongation of ufg composites would be 
improved or not. 
4.1.1 The Observation and Statistic Distribution of Grain Size  
  The desired grain sizes were obtained by controlling the FSP parameters, i.e., the 
dimension of tool, rotating speeds, and traversed speeds, as listed in Table 3-1. Six 
kinds of FSP specimens are prepared, namely, the A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 and A6 samples, 
with various combinations of the FSP parameters, resulting specific grain sizes shown 
in Fig 4-1(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k). These typical bright-field TEM images (Fig 
4-1(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k)) indicate that the FSPed samples consists of equiaxed grains 
orientated randomly, as can be seen form the corresponding selected area diffraction 
pattern (SADP) included in the upper right inset in Fig 4-1(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k). The 
SADP images indicate the diffraction spots suggest the existence of high-angle grain 
boundaries, consistent with previous FSPed results [153]. In parallel, Figures 
4-1(b)(d)(f)(h)(j)(l) show the SEM micrographs of A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 and A6 
samples with the grain size distribution. The six samples show a monotonic grain size 
distribution with an average grain size of 0.33, 0.48, 0.83, 1.15, 1.65 and 3.55 μm, 
respectively. Neither sample exhibited a bimodal grain size distribution in this study.  
4.1.2 Mechanical Properties 
  The engineering and true stress-strain curves of the A-l, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5 and 
A-6 samples are compared in Fig 4-2 (a), and Fig 4-2 (b), respectively. The results of 
tensile properties obtained from Fig 4-2 are summarized in Table 4-1, in which data 
of duplicate specimens are presented for each grain size. In addition, the uniform 
elongation (marked by the symbol   on every curve in Fig 4-2(a)) was determined 
by the ,Conside re s′ criterion (Eq. 4-1) governing the onset of localized deformation

and A15Z-6 (Table 3-1), were processed at the specific operation parameters. Figures 
4-5(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k) show the SEM micrographs of the samples A5Z-1, A5Z-2, A5Z-3, 
A5Z-4, A5Z-5 and A5Z-6, revealing a well-defined equiaxed grain nature. In parallel, 
Figures 4-5(b)(d)(f)(h)(j)(l)(n) show the TEM micrographs of A5Z-1, A5Z-2, A5Z-3, 
A5Z-4, A5Z-5 and A5Z-6 with the grain size distribution. The six Al-5Zn-Al2O3 
samples show a monotonic grain size distribution with an average grain size of 0.36, 
0.57, 0.85, 1.10, 1.65 and 3.30 μm, respectively. As described above, Figures 
4-6(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k) show the TEM micrographs of the samples A15Z-1, A15Z-2, 
A15Z-3, A15Z-4, A15Z-5 and A15Z-6, also revealing a well-defined equiaxed-grain 
nature. In parallel, Figures 4-6 (b)(d)(f)(h)(j)(l)(n) show the TEM micrographs of 
A15Z-1, A15Z-2, A15Z-3, A15Z-4, A15Z-5 and A15Z-6 with the grain size 
distribution. The six Al-5Zn-Al2O3 samples show a monotonic grain size distribution 
with an average grain size of 0.30, 0.45, 0.75, 1.0, 1.50 and 3.20 μm, respectively. 
Neither sample exhibited a bimodal grain size distribution in this study. These typical 
bright-field TEM images indicate that the FSPed samples consists of equiaxed-grains 
orientated randomly, as can be seen form the corresponding selected area diffraction 
pattern (SADP) included in the upper right inset in Fig 4-5(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k) and 
4-6(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k). The SADP images indicate the diffraction spots suggest the 
existence of high-angle grain boundaries, as well. 
4.2.2 Mechanical Properties 
  The engineering and true stress-strain curves of Al-5Zn-15Al2O3 (A5Z-l, A5Z-2, 
A5Z-3, A5Z-4, A5Z-5, and A5Z-6) and Al-15Zn-15Al2O3 (A15Z-l, A15Z-2, A15Z-3, 
A15Z-4, A15Z-5, and A15Z-6) samples are compared in Fig 4-7(a)(b) and Fig 4-8 
(a)(b), respectively. The results of tensile properties obtained from Fig 4-7 and Fig 
4-8 are summarized in Table 4-2, in which data of duplicate specimens are presented 
for Al-5Zn and Al-15Zn samples with specific grain size. In addition, the uniform 
elongation (marked by the symbol   on the curves in Fig 4-7(a) and Fig 4-8(a)) was 
determined by the ,Conside re s′ criterion (Eq. 4-1). Specifically, A5Z-1 as an example, 
adding 5 wt% Zn into A-1 sample increased the yield strength, ultimate strength, 
uniform elongation by 240.1 MPa, 319.0 MPa, and 6.0%, which is slightly higher 
than the 239.8 MPa, 293.4 MPa, and 4.3% (A-1 sample). Significantly, adding 15 
wt% Zn into A-1 sample enhanced the yield strength, ultimate strength, uniform 
elongation by 261.3 MPa, 327.2 MPa, and 9.1%, which is much larger than those of 
A-1 sample. These results indicate that the processing strategy of adding Zn dissolved 
into ufg Al alloys and Al-Al2O3 composites developed in this study is an effective 
method to improve uniform elongation and strength simultaneously. However, for 
Al-15Zn-15Al2O3 samples, it is noted that the increase of ultimate strength with grain 
sizes is almost the same, indicating the dependence of strength and grain size would 
be gradually reduced with increasing the Zn content.  
Figure 4-9 and Figure 4-10 shows the plot of log true stress vs. log true strain of the 
Al-5Zn-15Al2O3 (A5Z-l, A5Z-2, A5Z-3, A5Z-4, A5Z-5, and A5Z-6) and 
Al-15Zn-15Al2O3 (A15Z-l, A15Z-2, A15Z-3, A15Z-4, A15Z-5, and A15Z-6) samples 
as a function of grain size. The straight lines in these plots were fitted using linear 
regression analysis. It is confirmed by these values (seen in Fig 4-9 and Fig 4-10) of n 
the strain hardening of the Al-5Zn-15Al2O3 and Al-15Zn-15Al2O3 samples were 
greater that the aforementioned Al-15Al2O3 samples. In comparison of 
Al-5Zn-15Al2O3 and Al-15Zn-15Al2O3 samples, n values were increased with 
increasing the Zn content in solid solution. The increase in Al-15Zn-15Al2O3 samples 
is determined primary by ultrafine grains and is related to the Hall-Petch equation. 
Morrison et al. [169] claims that the increase in the exponent of work hardening in 
 18 
boundaries is very essential even during deformation. The results is inconsistent with 
deformed Al alloys [160] and also unexpected to general concept of more dislocations 
stored at the grain boundaries. Therefore, the role of Zn content becomes strongly 
dependent on grain boundaries characteristics. 
4.3 Al-Zn system 
4.3.1 The Statistic Distribution of Grain Size  
  In this experiment, binary Al-based alloy (with 5 and 15 wt% Zn) were prepared by 
above methods and dissolved into Al matrix using FSP. The Al-5wt%Zn and 
Al-15wt%Zn were denoted as Al-5Zn and Al-15Zn, respectively. Then, fourteen 
samples, Z5-1, Z5-2, Z5-3, Z5-4, Z5-5, Z5-6, Z5-7, Z15-1, Z15-2, Z15-3, Z15-4, 
Z15-5, Z15-6 and Z15-7 (Table 3-1), were processed at the specific operation 
parameters. Figures 4-17(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k)(m) show the SEM micrographs of the 
samples Z5-1, Z5-2, Z5-3, Z5-4, Z5-5, Z5-6 and Z5-7, revealing a well-defined 
equiaxed grain nature. In parallel, Figures 4-17 (b)(d)(f)(h)(j)(l)(n) show the SEM 
micrographs of Z5-1, Z5-2, Z5-3, Z5-4, Z5-5, Z5-6 and Z5-7 with the grain size 
distribution. The seven Al-5Zn samples show a monotonic grain size distribution with 
an average grain size of 0.38, 0.50, 0.60, 0.78, 0.93, 1.30 and 1.92 μm, respectively. 
As described above, Figures 4-18(a)(c)(e)(g)(i)(k)(m) show the SEM micrographs of 
the samples Z15-1, Z15-2, Z15-3, Z15-4, Z15-5, Z15-6 and Z15-7, also revealing a 
well-defined equiaxed grain nature. In parallel, Figures 4-18 (b)(d)(f)(h)(j)(l)(n) show 
the SEM micrographs of Z15-1, Z15-2, Z15-3, Z15-4, Z15-5, Z15-6 and Z15-7 with 
the grain size distribution. The seven Al-15Zn samples show a monotonic grain size 
distribution with an average grain size of 0.35, 0.48, 0.56, 0.74, 0.90, 1.20 and 1.75 
μm, respectively. Neither sample exhibited a bimodal grain size distribution in this 
study. Most of the grains in the FSP specimens exhibit a high angle boundary 
structure, consistent with previous findings [24]. 
 
4.3.2 Mechanical Properties 
The engineering and true stress-strain curves of the Al-5Zn (Z5-l, Z5-2, Z5-3, Z5-4, 
Z5-5, Z5-6 and Z5-7) and Al-15Zn (Z15-l, Z15-2, Z15-3, Z15-4, Z15-5, Z15-6 and 
Z15-7) samples are compared in Fig 4-19(a)(b) and Fig 4-20 (a)(b), respectively. The 
results of tensile properties obtained from Fig 4-19 and Fig 4-20 are summarized in 
Table 4-3, in which data of duplicate specimens are presented for Al-5Zn and 
Al-15Zn samples with specific grain size. In addition, the uniform elongation (marked 
by the symbol   on the curves in Fig 4-19(a) and Fig 4-20(a)) was determined by 
the ,Conside re s′ criterion (Eq. 4-1). However, as for samples with grain size less than 
1 m (Z5-1~Z5-4, Z15-1~Z15-4), it did not apparent enhancement on uniform 
elongation, indicating that the work hardening rates have minor contribution to the 
total elongation. However, these samples with grain size less than 1 m reveal the 
significant improvement in total elongation, suggesting that the primary improvement 
in elongation is caused by other contribution, with an exception of work hardening 
interior grains. 
Figure 4-21 and Figure 4-22 shows the plots of log true stress vs. log true strain of 
the Al-5Zn (Z5-1, Z5-2, Z5-3, Z5-4, Z5-5, Z5-6 and Z5-7) and Al-15Zn (Z15-1, 
Z15-2, Z15-3, Z15-4, Z15-5, Z15-6 and Z15-7) samples as a function of grain size, 
respectively. The straight lines in these plots were fitted using linear regression 
analysis. Data from log εσ versus logε  plots of Al-5Zn, a slight difference in slope 
between the data of samples Z5-1 to Z5-5 attest to the roughly same value of 0.03 in 
work hardening exponent which are only 3 times higher than ultra-fine grained 
polycrystalline (n~ 0.01) [13]. However, the flow stress curves of the Z5-1 to Z5-5 
 20 
3, 20, 45% plastic strain, respectively, showing the marker line offsets induced by 
GBS. It can be observed that the GBS was mostly observed in the limited necking 
region only and no larger quantity of surface porosities induced by GBS was found 
outer gauge region, indicating the GBS was more difficult to diffuse to all gauge 
region compared to Z15-1 sample. Therefore, the region range of GBS changes that 
occurred when the increasing of Zn content dissolved into Al matrix enhance ductility 
significantly, which why we have observed such a significant increase in total 
ductility in the Z15-1 sample rather than in the Z5-1 sample. Significantly, based on 
the marker line scratched by FIB on the polished surface, it is precise and convenient 
to experimentally measure the localized strain for GBS and other deformation. 
Furthermore, an overview of a deformed region in the Z15-6 is shown a large 
number of slip lines and GBS can clearly be seen (shown in Fig 4-25). Hence the 
mixing of slip line within grains and GBS were contributed to strain during 
deformation. The results were consistent with the Z15-7 curve in Fig 4-20 which 
exhibit excellent uniform and total ductility. For comparison, shown in Fig 4-23, it is 
obvious that the quantity of slip lines inside grains of deformed surfaces of Z15-1 
sample was far less obvious than Z15-6 sample, indicating that the quantities of slip 
bands inside grains were significantly decreased with decreasing grain size. 
  The microstructure in the uniformly deformed region of tensile tested specimens 
was examined by TEM. Figure 4-27 (a) and Figure 4-27(b) show typical bright-field 
TEM images from the gauge section of Z5-1 sample before and after about ε =0.10 
tensile tests, respectively. Figure 4-28(a) and Figure 4-28(b) show typical bright-field 
TEM images from the gauge section of Z15-1 sample before and after about ε =0.10 
tensile tests, respectively., For Z5-1 and Z15-1 sample before strain, most grains are 
free of dislocation in the grain interior and at boundaries, as shown in Fig. 4-27(a) and 
Fig. 4-28(a), respectively. However, for Z5-1 sample after about ε =0.10, by careful 
examination of the grains free of dislocation, it was noted that the grain boundaries of 
some those grains had lost their sharpness, which might be due to dislocations being 
trapped at the grain boundaries as shown in Fig 4-27(b). The results is similar to 
deformed pure Al [160]. In general, for ufg material after deformation, few 
dislocations than normal are stored in the grain interior and more dislocations are 
stored at the grain boundaries. In contrary, for Z15-1 sample after ε =0.10 (Fig 
4-28(b)), it is noted that free-dislocations in the grains interior and boundaries were 
observed, indicating no dislocations were found in grain interior and at boundaries. 
Clearly, the Zn content dissolved in Al matrix and characterization of grain boundary 
structure were of central importance in the present research. 
Changes in atomic configuration at or near grain boundaries during deformation 
were observed using HREM. The sample Z15-1 was selected for observation because 
of the most obvious softening. In the present work, in order to observe the 
grain-boundary structure, Figure 4-34 and Figure 4-35 shows HREM images from the 
gauge sections of tensile Z15-1 sample before and after tensile loading 
(about 10%ε ≈ ), respectively. In Fig 4-34(a), grain 1 is aligned along [110] zone axis, 
and the three lattice fringe observed corresponding to the (111), (002), and 
(111) planes. It should be noted that the angle between the (002) planes in 
neighboring grains are about 60o suggesting high angle boundaries. In Fig 4-35(a), 
grain 1 is aligned along [110] zone axis, and the three lattice fringe observed 
corresponding to the (111), (002), and (111) planes. It should be noted that the angle 
between the (002) planes in neighboring grains are about 60o suggesting high angle 
boundaries. To highlight the atomic structure at and near the grain boundary, the

Chapter 5  Discussions 
5.1 Uniform and Total Elongation 
Accordingly, the disappointingly low tensile uniform elongation of those ufg is 
mainly imputed to this vulnerability to localized deformation/ failure modes that 
plague nearly all ufg and nc materials. In this study, these samples were divided into 
two groups on account for the differences of uniform and total elongation in 
deformation mechanisms and then compared mutually. 
The grain size dependence of uniform and total elongation of Al-Al2O3 (A-1~A-6) 
sample is shown in Fig 5-1, where values of uniform elongation (Fig. 5-1(a)) and total 
elongation (Fig. 5-1(b)) are plotted as a function of inverse square root of the grain 
size. The grain size dependence of uniform and total elongation of Al-Zn-Al2O3 
(A5Z-1~A5Z-6 and A15Z-1~A15Z-6) samples are shown in Fig 5-2, where values of 
uniform elongation (Fig. 5-2(a)) and total elongation (Fig. 5-2(b)) are plotted as a 
function of inverse square root of the grain size. The grain size dependence of 
uniform and total elongation of Al-Zn (Z5-1~Z5-7, and Z15-1~Z15-7) sample are 
shown in Fig 5-3, where values of uniform elongation (Fig. 5-3(a)) and total 
elongation (Fig. 5-3(b)) are plotted as a function of inverse square root of the grain 
size.  
With regard to the aforementioned summary of uniform elongation, in comparison 
of the pure Al [13], Al-5Zn and Al-15Zn samples (Fig. 5-3(a)), the turning points of 
grain size for unexpected sudden drop of uniform elongation decrease from 1 μm to 
0.9 μm, and to 0.7 μm, indicating that the loss of uniform elongation can be improved 
somewhat by adding a higher Zn content in the solid solution. However, the effect of 
adding Zn dissolved in the solid solution is not apparent to improve uniform 
elongation when grain sizes were less than 1 m. Furthermore, by engineering very 
small Al2O3 particles into ufg Al alloy matrix, it can help delay localized deformation 
under stress, leading to improved ductility (including uniform elongation due to 
sustained work hardening) rather than sacrificing its strength (Fig. 5-1). However, the 
uniform elongation of the A-1 sample is only 4.1 %. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 5-2 
(a) the uniform elongation of Al-5Zn-15Al2O3 and Al-5Zn-15Al2O3 sample were 
improved significantly compared to Al-Al2O3 samples. Significantly, the uniform 
elongation of A15Z-1 sample is 9.1 %, which is more than twice that of the A-1 
samples and above the critical ductility (5%) required for many structural applications. 
The results indicate that adding more Zn content into Al-Al2O3 matrix (A samples) 
significantly increased the uniform elongation due to work hardening enhanced, but 
the total ductility decreased slightly (Fig. 5-12(b)). Cheng et al. [99] and Zhao et al. 
[980] observed the dislocations cut through the coherent GP zones and accumulated 
around second-phase precipitation. Hence the combination of tiny GP zones (Fig. 
4-31) with strong atomic bonds in the zones [158-159] and undeformable 
second-phase particles (e.g., alumina particles) can effectively hinder dislocation 
motion, resulting in increased dislocation storage capability, which will increase the 
work hardening rate  1 d

With regard to the aforementioned summary of total elongation, for the Al-Al2O3, 
(Fig. 5-1(b)) Al-5Zn-15Al2O3 (Fig. 5-2(b)), and Al-15Zn-15Al2O3 (Fig. 5-2(b)) 
samples, the decreasing trend of total elongation as function of d-1/2 were improved 
(Fig. 5-3(b)). In other words, the unexpected sudden drop of total elongation were 
disappear when grain size was less than 1 m. Especially, for the Al-5Zn and 
Al-15Zn samples, the decreasing trend of total elongation as a function of d-1/2 
becomes much milder (Fig. 5-3(b)). Especially, for a grain size of 0.5 m, the total 
 24 
free slip distance and thus the dynamic recovery rate is lower. 
Figure 5-7(a) and Figure 5-7(b) show the yield and flow stresses at strains of 0.002 
(yield stress), 0.005, 0.015, 0.020 and 0.050 as a function of the inverse square-root of 
the grain size of  A5Z and A15Z samples,  respectively. At strain level of 0.002 
(yield), 0.005, 0.015, 0.020 and 0.050, the observed behavior is similar to the general 
traditional pure Al alloy and composites as it follows the Hall-Petch relation. 
However, it is noticeable that the k value decrease with strain gradually, meaning the 
difference in work hardening rates for two conditions is small at low strain levels and 
it becomes larger at higher strains, especially for A15Z samples [163]. Figure 5-8(a) 
and Figure 5-8(b) show the dependence of friction stress ( eσ ) and ek at different 
strains for Al-15Al2O3, Al-5Zn-15Al2O3 and Al-15Zn-15Al2O3 samples, respectively. 
In general, eσ is the lattice friction stress that includes the contribution from solute 
atoms and particles, and ek is the relative hardening contribution of the GBs. Among 
the three group samples, the increase in eσ  with strain is due to work hardening 
within the grain and the solution hardening owing to Zn (G-P zones) (Fig. 4-31) or 
alumina particles (Fig. 4-14(b)). Hence, it is obvious that work hardening interior 
grains get larger with an increase in the Zn content (Fig. 5-8(a)). In other words, under 
the influence of an applied stress, more and more dislocations were heavily tangled 
around alumina dispersoids and solute atoms, resulting in higher work hardening 
within grains (Fig. 4-14(b)) and an increase in eσ . However, there is a tendency for 
the eσ value to get plateau at much higher strain ( 0.05ε = ), this could reflect the 
saturation on work hardening rate with strain [164]. As shown in Fig. 5-8(b) there is a 
tendency for the ek value to decrease with increasing Zn content dissolved in 
Al-15Al2O3. The reduction of ek  value was mainly contributed to the enhanced rate 
of dislocation annihilation at GBs [165], resulting the deformation mechanism 
changes from transgranular slip to GBS, hence, the basis for the H-P relation no 
longer applied. 
Furthermore, Figure 5-9(a) and Figure 5-9(b) show the yield and flow stresses at 
strains of 0.002, 0.005, 0.015 and 0.020 for Al-5Zn and Al-15Zn samples as a 
function of the inverse square-root of the grain size, respectively. For the Al-5Zn 
samples, at strain level of 0.002, 0.005, and 0.015, the observed behavior is similar to 
the general traditional pure Al alloy and composites as it follows the Hall-Petch 
relation. However, at strain of 0.020 and grain size less than 0.5 m, a slight 
deviation change in the slope of the Hall-Petch relation was observed (Fig. 5-9(a)). In 
addition, experimental results in Al-15Zn samples reveal that the Hall-Petch 
relationship recorded also can not be extrapolated to grain sizes of less than~1m 
( 1/ 2 ~ 1.4d − m-1/2) (Fig. 5-9 (b)). Therefore, for a given high Zn content in solid 
solution, the finer materials have a different deformation mechanism that become 
dominant once the grain size is reduced down below a critical value , which is believe 
to cause the observed slight in the slope of the Hall-Petch plot as the strain increases. 
Figure 5-9(b) also suggest that the starting of GBS for Z15-1 sample was occurred at 
very early stage of tensile test, as can be easily understood form Fig 4-23(b), which 
results in deviation from the regular trend in the Hall-Petch relation.  
 
5.3 The Correlations between Deformation Mechanism and Grain Boundary 
Diffusion 
Many attempts were made to interpret the origin of the observed deviation from 
 26 
polycrystalline Taylor factor, Ω the atomic volume ( 3b ), G the shear modulus.  
 Therefore, the annihilation frequency gbυ was depending strongly on the choice of 
the GB diffusion coefficient gbD . Especially, the control of GB diffusion becomes 
very important at low temperatures, where GB diffusion is the rate-controlling 
mechanism of mass transport (mechanism of diffusion can be orders of magnitude 
faster than lattice diffusion [174]). In the following we will discuss the GB diffusion 
coefficient gbD obtained by various measurement and conditions. Determining the GB 
diffusion coefficient gbD  is a rather critical point. The different techniques used lead 
to strongly diverging results. In [175] the data were obtained for 65Zn tracer GB 
diffusion in the 99.99% purity Al polycrystal within the temperature interval 428-593 
K. Three groups of GBs were defined, namely (I) high-angle GBs with high activation 
energy Q of GB diffusion ( osD δ =
91 10−× 3 1m s− , Q=118 1kJmol− ), (II) high-angle GBs 
with low activation energy ( osD δ =
111.6 10−× 3 1m s− , Q=90 1kJmol− ) and (III) 
low-angle GBs between subgrains ( osD δ =
243 10−× 3 1m s− , Q=60 1kJmol− ). 
Extrapolation of these data to 300 K yield, respectively, (I) sDδ = 243 10−× 3 1m s− , (II) 
sDδ = 262 10−× 3 1m s− , and (III) sDδ = 293 10−× 3 1m s− . In addition, in [176] the 
parameters of Zn diffusion were measured by electron probe microanalysis in Al 
bicrystals with individual tilt and twist GBs with various misorientation angles within 
the interval 523-613 K. The pre-exponentials osD δ and activation energies Q for tilt 
GBs lie within the intervals 16 122 10 10− −× − 3 1m s− and 40-80 1kJmol− , respectively 
[177]. The pre-exponentials and activation energies for twist GBs are within the 
intervals 15 910 10− −− 3 1m s−  and 50-130 1kJmol− , respectively [178]. The 
extrapolation to 300 K yields sDδ values for tilt GBs between 2410− and 2210− 3 1m s− . 
Therefore, all tilt GB studied in [175] and some twist GBs form a family of 
“high-diffusivity” GBs which can build channels for the diffusion which is enough to 
be as a possible mechanism of dislocation of fast annihilation. As for the observation 
of Cai et al. [179] both twist and tilt boundaries type were formed by dynamic 
recrystallization during FSW. In [180] the parameters of Zn GB diffusion were 
determined using the discontinuous precipitation reaction controlled by GB diffusion. 
The 65Zn  tracer measurements obtained in the temperature interval 493-673 K 
demonstrate that the increase of Zn content can further enhance the GB diffusivity in 
Al-Zn alloys [181-182]. The extrapolation to 300K yields sD(300K) ≈  
223 10−× 13 −sm (2 wt% Zn), 2110− 13 −sm (4.33 wt% Zn) and 2010− 13 −sm (8-10 wt% Zn). 
The available data for GB diffusion of Zn in Al give the value of sD(300K)≈  
1910− 13 −sm (15 wt% Zn) for a GB thickness =0.5 nm and a segregation factor s=1. 
In contrary, based on data on GB diffusion in Al, we summary some general element 
dissolved into Al matrix. The extrapolation of the data for Mg [183-184], Cu [185] , 
Sn [186], and Ga [187] GB diffusion in Al to 300 K yields a value of sD(300K) 
of 28 3 15 10 m s− −× , 24 3 11.3 10 m s− −× , 26 3 16.148 10 m s− −× and 21 3 110 m s− − , respectively. 
Therefore, based on the comparison of GB diffusion, it is viable the GBs in Al 
provide the effective diffusion paths for Zn due to combination of unique boundaries 
structure (high-angle, twist and tilt) and high content of Zn dissolved in Al matrix the 
which can be responsible for the fast dislocation annihilation at boundaries. 
The rate of GB relaxation involving atomic movements can be accelerated by the 
introduction of lattice vacancies [188]. It is conceivable that high vacancy content of 
 28 
lattice dislocation at boundaries was still occurred whether or not the second phase 
particles hindered. But to think it in another way, it may be surmised a pronounced 
work hardening rate within grain can be maintained as a result of sliding-resistance of 
nano-scale alumina even when the relaxed and dislocation-free boundaries was still 
occurred.  
5.4 Strain Rate Sensitivity  
The strain rate response can be investigated using the phenomenological definition 
of strain rate sensitivity [197]: 
ln
ln
m σ
ε
∂
=
∂ 
                                                         5-5 
where σ is the flow stress and ε

is the strain rate. In general higher m values are 
expected to delay the onset of necking according to Hart’s criterion for a strain rate 
sensitivity material resulting in improved ductility [198,199]. The strain rate 
sensitivity were measured by the tensile stress-strain curves at strain rate 1x10-3 s-1 
and 1x10-4 s-1 at room temperature. For each tensile test, the strain rate sensitivity, m, 
as a function of tensile strain for Al-5Zn (Fig. 5-12(a)) and Al-15Zn (Fig. 5-12(b)) 
samples. In parallel, the strain rate sensitivity, m, as a function of tensile strain for 
Al-Al2O3 (Fig. 5-11(a)), Al-5Zn-Al2O3 (Fig. 5-11(b)) and Al-15Zn-Al2O3 (Fig. 5-11(c)) 
samples, respectively.  
The estimated values for A15Z-1 sample are from m=0.016 at lower strain range to 
m=0.030 at higher strain range which is more than three times that of the A-1 sample 
and superior the recorded in fcc metal (similar grain sizes) deformed at low 
temperature [200-201]. In comparison of strain rate sensitivity on Al-5Zn-Al2O3 (Fig. 
5-11(b)) samples, the estimated values for A5Z-1 are from m=0.011 at lower strain to 
m=0.017 at higher strain range. Hence, the material with 15 wt% Zn exhibits higher m 
in value than the material containing 5 wt%. The enhanced m in value for the A15Z-1 
sample is again implicit of a changed stimulated deformation mechanism. The 
conclusions from the aforementioned experiments, it is suggested that the strain rate 
sensitivity were increased due to a spontaneous to GB diffusion assisted annihilation 
of GB dislocations, resulting in GBS which is also accompanied by atomic diffusion 
and relaxation [193,202]. However, because of sliding-resistance due to alumina 
particles, the m in value was difficult to enhance significantly even though extremely 
high GB diffusion assisted annihilation of GB dislocations were still carried on. The 
sliding-resistance provides an explanation for the limited m in value (only m=0.030).  
  The sliding-resistance of alumina particles on grain boundaries is known to 
influence significantly mechanical properties, and as a consequence, the effects of Zn 
dissolved into Al matrix were difficult to clarify, especially its connection with strain 
rate sensitivity, has not been understood well. The estimated values for Z5-1 and 
Z15-1 sample are about 0.04 and 0.1, respectively. It is obvious that as the Zn content 
increases the m value increases significantly. As for Z15-1 sample, it is noted that the 
m value is more than ten times that of the similar grain size of pure Al sample and 
also superior the recorded in SRS of Al deformed at low temperature (Fig. 5-13). The 
results were consistent the formation of GBS as a result of proposed explanation of 
fast rate of annihilation of lattice dislocation at boundaries.
