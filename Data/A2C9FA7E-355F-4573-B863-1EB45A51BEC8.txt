 行動式無線射頻技術委任授權協定之分析及改良 
 
摘   要 
無 線 射 頻 識 別 (Radio Frequency Identification, 
RFID)為一種可透過無線訊號識別特定電子標籤並且讀
寫其內容的技術。隨著各種無線通訊技術的普及，近年
來更發展出結合行動通訊技術發展成行動無線射頻識別
(Mobile RFID)技術。行動無線射頻識別技術中一重要之
應用即為離線委任授權(Delegation)機制，即 RFID 後端
資料庫可以將電子標籤的存取權預先授與行動讀取器，
使其可在離線狀態下與電子標籤進行身分確認及授權驗
證。本論文針對楊等人之委任授權協定進行安全性分析
並針對其缺失加以改良。1 
關鍵詞：Mobile RFID、委任、無線安全  
 
1. RFID 委任協定與離線認證協定  
 
在後端資料庫將電子標籤的委任權限交給行動讀
取器後，行動讀取器便可在與後端資料庫離線的狀態下
識別並讀取電子標籤的相關資訊。後端資料庫與行動讀
取器皆因具有較高的計算能力，因此我們假設後端資料
庫與行動讀取器之間的訊息傳輸是安全的，後端資料庫
可利用此安全的通道進行委任權限的交給，而行動讀取
器亦可透過此通道取得權限和電子標籤資訊。但由於電
子標籤不具有如此的計算能力，所以電子標籤與行動讀
取器之間訊息的傳遞是處於不安全的通道上，可能遭受
到惡意攻擊者種種的攻擊。 
 
1.1. 初始化設定  
 
當行動讀取器離線讀取電子標籤時，電子標籤必須
與行動讀取器進行雙向認證，接著透過讀取控制表限制
此行動讀取器的讀取次數。電子標籤需具備計算一種雜
湊函數及產生隨機亂數的能力，而且擁有足夠的儲存空
間，讓電子標籤記錄標籤的相關資訊和其讀取控制表可
記錄下擁有讀取此電子標籤權限之行動讀取器的資訊，
以及進行協定時計算相關資訊的的暫存空間。任一電子
                                                            
 
標籤記錄的內容如表 1，於初始化設定時，其時間戳記𝑇𝑆!為 0，且讀取控制表皆為空的。 
行動讀取器為適用於我們所提出的委任授權與離
線認證標籤協定，首先行動讀取器需具有足夠的儲存空
間，於與後端資料庫進行委任授權協定時，記錄下後端
資料庫授權行動讀取器可讀取電子標籤的委任授權表，
行動讀取器內容資訊如表 2。並且，行動讀取器需具備
計算與電子標籤同一種雜湊函數的能力，並且亦需產生
隨機亂數的能力，而且有足夠的暫存空間讓行動讀取器
進行協定時計算使用。任一行動讀取器於初始化設定時，
便擁有唯一的行動讀取器識別碼𝑅𝐼𝐷!，並且其擁有可與
後端資料庫認證的相關資訊和空的委任授權表。

一、 會議簡介 
 
The International Conference on Systems continues a series of 
events covering a broad spectrum of topics. The conference covers 
fundamentals on designing, implementing, testing, validating and 
maintaining various kinds of software and hardware systems. 
Several tracks are proposed to treat the topics from theory to 
practice, in terms of methodologies, design, implementation, 
testing, use cases, tools, and lessons learnt. 
 
In the last years, new system concepts have been promoted and 
partially embedded in new deployments. Anticipative systems, 
autonomic and autonomous systems, self-adapting systems, or 
on-demand systems are systems exposing advanced features. These 
features demand special requirements specification mechanisms, 
advanced behavioral design patterns, special interaction 
protocols, and flexible implementation platforms. Additionally, 
they require new monitoring and management paradigms, as 
self-protection, self-diagnosing, self-maintenance become core 
design features.

六、論文全文 
 
  
 Abstract — In this paper, we propose an ownership transfer scheme that applies in mobile RFID networks. The scheme includes a 
mutual authentication protocol and a role-based ownership transfer protocol. A tag will decide what actions are allowed for a reader 
according to the reader’s role class, and the back-end server will send to the reader the requested information about the tag. 
Keyed-hash functions are used to secure the protocols. Last, we prove that our protocol can do against the threats of replay attacks, 
distributed denial of service (DDoS), Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks that change users’ data, interception of data and location 
privacy, and tracking of tags’ ownership transfer. 
Keywords-RFID;authentication; ownership transfer 
I. INTRODUCTION 
RFID features mass identification, large data size, modifiable identification and data, and effective scanning of tags by 
batch processing at long distance. Nowadays, mobile RFID [1][11] integrating reading chips, passive RFID tags and mobile 
phones enables users to access information. Mobile RFID can be applied in business transaction; through the transfer of tagged 
products’ ownership, each transaction can be done with mobile RFID. The transfer of a tagged product’s ownership suggests 
whoever is registered in the tag is the one entitled to the item. 
To protect the privacy of both the former and current owners of a tagged item, RFID protocol designers have to make sure 
that when the item’s ownership changes, its tag’s ownership has to change accordingly and simultaneously. Former owners, 
therefore, will no longer be able to access the tag, whereas the current owners have no way to track the privacy history that was 
kept in the tag, either.  
Due to the limitation of tags, there are only 2000 logic gates in a passive tag to do security functions [4][7]. In 2006, John 
Ayoade[5] proposed an authentication-control framework, creating a table on back-end authentication server (AS) to control 
the reader-tag authentication. When a reader accesses a tag, the tag will send out its identifier and encrypted messages to the 
reader, and the reader sends a reading request to the AS. The AS checks the reader’s identity and gives a key to the reader to 
decrypt the message and grant the ownership of the tag. 
The authorization and ownership transfer process, the delegation, should be done securely to protect the owner and the 
tags [3][8][9][10]. If the delegation process is incomplete, the former owner could still access the tag [2]. Fouladgar proposed a 
delegation protocol to deal with incomplete ownership transfer [8][9][10]. In the protocol, the delegated reader can verify the 
digital certificate of a current owner’s reader through a certificate authority (CA) during the ownership transfer process, and 
the key stored in the tag is updated by the AS to ensure only the current owner can access the tag. 
Although delegated readers reduce the computation load of the AS, the reader’s computation resources such as CPU and 
memory are limited. When a reader has too many delegated tags, it can no longer afford the authentication task because it does 
not have enough memory to keep tags’ information. Fouladgar’s protocol uses counters to limit delegated readers seemed to 
fail to take good control of reading limits.  
When malicious users sent a large number of queries to the tags, the tags will keep asking AS to update the keys. If the 
update message was lost or abandoned by attackers, Foudladgar’s protocol will fail and the owner’s reader will lost the tag. To 
prevent this kind of DoS attack, Osaka[6] proposed another ownership transfer scheme. In Osaka’s scheme, the tag confirms 
the ownership transfer is completed with AS in every session. However, in Osaka’s scheme, a reader should have large 
 Step 2. The reader forwards the message to AS to verify the identity of the tag.  
Step 3. AS verifies tag’s identity and queries Object Name Server (ONS) to get the detailed information of the tag. 
Step 4. ONS sends the tag’s URL of EPC IS to AS. 
Step 5. According to the URL, AS requests the tag’s information from EPC IS, which is the back-end database of tags. 
Step 6. EPC IS sends the tag’s information to AS. 
Step 7. AS sends the tag’s information to the reader. 
    Because a passive tag’s computation resources is limited, the packets uses a keyed-hash function hx(), generated with the 
key x shared by the tag and the authentication server to prevent eavesdropping. The traffic between the readers and the AS is 
protected by traditional symmetric encryption algorithm Ek(). Back-end server, including AS, ONS and EPC IS, are trusted by 
tags and readers. 
    To manage a reader’s authority over a specific tag, AS and the tag must store the authorizing information. Figure 2(a) 
stored the corresponding actions of readers of different role classes (RCs) to the tag TID 80 in a RC-Action table. In the table, 
the tag owner has the highest privileges to modify the actions of each RC. The role in an upper row has higher privileges. As 
shown in Figure 2(a), readers with an owner-level RC are entitled to Action 3, which means they are also authorized to do 
Action 1 and Action 2. In addition, the relevant information of tags is stored in different EPC ISs, as in Figure 2(b): 
(1) Readers’ Access Control List: each row indicates each reader’s RC class. For example, the reader RID 312’s authority 
over TID 80 is B-class RC.  
(2) Action Table: the AS decides what command could be send from the reader to the tag. For example, the reader with 
RID 312 can access TID 80’s public (general) data and private (personal) data.

 reader read a tag, the Mobile Mutual Authentication Procedure (MMAP) is preforms with 8 steps: 
Step 1. When a reader queries a tag, the tag generates a random number r1 and creates a secret value S by XOR-ing r1 and 
its own identifier TID, and computes )rTID(hS 1xK ⊕= . The tag sends S and r1 to the reader. 
Step 2. The reader generates another random number r2, and sends )Command,RID,r,r,S(E 21drk to the server. 
Step 3. The server decrypts the message with Kdr and computes )( 1rTIDh xK ⊕  for all tags to obtain TID. 
Step 4. The server looks up Reader’s Access Control List to find out the reader’s RC, access level, and generate a random 
number r3. It computes ),,( 321 CommandRCrrrTIDhT yK ⊕⊕⊕= and )TIDr(hp 3yK ⊕= . The server encrypts T, p, 
r2 and r3 with a session key Kdr, i.e. )r,r,p,T(E 32drK , and sends the result to the reader.  
Step 5. The reader decrypts the message with the session key Kdr and verifies r2. If it’s correct, the reader forwards T, r2 
and r3 to the tag. 
Step 6. The tag verifies T by searching all the possible values of RC and commands. It computes )TIDr(hp 3yK ⊕= , 
)ActrTID(hG 3xK ⊕⊕= and sends them to the reader. 
Step 7. The reader verifies p, and forwards G and r3 to the server by computing )r,G(E 3drK . 
Step 8. The server verifies G to find a matched Act, and searches the action table in Figure 2. to find a matched Command. 
If the Command matches the Act, the reader is authorized, and the server sends the requested tag’s data to the 
reader. 
 
The complete mutual authentication protocol is illustrated in Figure 4:

Figure 4.  Mobile Mutual Authentication Procedure 
C. Ownership Transfer Procedure (OTP) 
After the server, the reader and the tag authenticate themselves to each other, the Ownership Transfer Procedure (OTP) is 
performed to transfer the ownership between the former owner and the current owner, as shown in Figure 5. The two 
owners should authenticate each other through a trust third party before perform the OTP. 
  The OTP is divided into two parts: 
 
 verifies )'C,'r(h 3PIN 1i+ . If the comparison is the same, the server modifies the reader’s Access Control List to change 
or delete the former owner’s tag identifier and reader’s RC. 
Step 13. The server sends the new PIN and C to the current owner.  
 
 
Figure 7.  The Second Part of OTP 
    The missing of message 10 and 11 could lead to asynchronous update of data between back-end server and the tag. Our 
protocol is designed to tackle such asynchrony in OTP and requires that the reader re-access the tag after it sends G’ to the 
server. Meanwhile, the server uses PINi for computation to generate G’ and check if this is the same as the G’ from the reader. 
If they are different, the server will compute again with other secret values to generate PINi+1 and re-queries G’. If the two G’s 
are the same, it means PINi+1 is the key of the tag and it has updated its key. Therefore, the server no longer needs to update 
the tag, and will send PINi+1 and C’ to the current owner directly. If the G’ that the server generates with PINi is identical to the 
one from the reader, the tag has missed message 10 in the communication and has not yet updated PINi. Consequently, 
back-end server begins to generate hPINi(r1’,C) and update the tag’s key with it. If the tag returns hPINi+1(r3’,C’), the update has 
been completed. After verification, the server will send PINi+1 and C’ to the current owner. The procedure is illustrated as 
below:

computes the hash values one by one and updates its RC-Action Table.

    Since a tag owner can modify its RC-Action Table at will, we will take the following example to show how an owner 
updates a tag’s RC-Action Table, enabling the RC-A users to access private data. Its initial state is shown in Figure 11 (a) and 
the tag’s identifier TID is 730. After the reader-tag mutual authentication, TID 730 verifies this reader as Owner. Now, the 
reader is able to modify TID 730’s RC-Action Table, updating RC-A’s Action from 1 to 2. That is to say, users authorized as 
RC-A can access not only public data but also private one.

    By controlling the RC-Action Table, a tag owner is also able to decide what level of data is accessible to what readers, 
according to their RCs. Thus, readers with lower authority is not entitled to the data that requires high authority, while readers 
with higher authority can fully access the tag at will. 
III. SECURITY ANALYSIS 
    In this section, we will prove that our OTP is able to secure ownership transfer against replay attacks, DoS from 
asynchronous update and MITM attacks that change messages; to achieve mutual authentication; and to protect the privacy of 
tags’ data and location, even though the valid readers have been attacked. Since we have assumed that the communication 
between a reader and AS is secured, we will just focus on the security of the reader and tag. 
 IV. PERFORMANCE 
    The performance of our schemes will be analyzed in this section and their results will be illustrated in detail in Table 1. 
TH represents the time that a hash function takes in one computation; TXOR, the time that an XOR takes in one computation; 
TRNG, the time it takes to generate a random number; N, the total tags that back-end server stores; L, the levels of a RC; M, the 
actions of a tag; P, the actions that a tag is entitled to. 
TABLE I.  PERFORMANCE OF TAG, READER AND BACK-END SERVER IN EACH SCHEME 
 
 
Table 1 indicates that the performance of the three items (tag, reader and back-end server) is based on the numbers that users 
design for L, M and P, whereas a reader does not need to store any keys to access a tag, e.g. in mobile mutual authentication 
and ownership transfer, except in the update of RC-Action Table. 
V. CONCLUSION 
    In the foreseeable future, RFID readers will not be confined by locations anymore. The combination of reading chips and 
mobile devices has made mobile readers come true and paved the way for the development of mobile RFID. However, security 
issues remain a pain for RFID engineers, traditional and mobile alike. As for mobile RFID, the security is even at more serious 
stake because malicious users might take unauthorized readers to access people’s tags and this could endanger the privacy of 
users and their data. For this reason, we propose a mutual authentication scheme for mobile RFID, using back-end server to 
verify readers and then find out their RCs. Besides, we require that back-end server send RCs via readers so that a tag can 
always obtain the current reader’s RC before being accessed. Tag owners subsequently look up the information tables stored in 
tags and decide what actions are allowed for a reader. Eventually, following a tag’s final decision, back-end server sends to a 
reader the requested information of this tag. Apart from these, this scheme is also capable of ownership transfer by updating 
tags’ keys. We use keyed-hash functions in the messages between tags and readers and therefore secure the tag-reader mutual 
authentication and ownership transfer against replay attacks, DoS from asynchronous update, MITM attacks’ modification of 
messages and malicious users’ tracking of tags’ location and ownership transfer history, and, last but not least, enhance the 
privacy of tags’ data and location.
