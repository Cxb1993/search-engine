optical region for metals, and at least in the terahertz-to-IR region for semiconductors
and insulators; and the latter occurs at much lower frequencies and usually tail off
toward terahertz and IR regions.2, 3, 6-11 However, since mid-1990s, theoretical
proposals for structured NIMs whoseε and μ could become negative in certain
frequency ranges were developed experimentally, and were capable to fabricate
various NIM structures at microscopic length-scales.10-12 All these results has put
Veselago’s proposal on spotlight.
Most of the NIMs that have been developed today are obtained by putting
together two structured materials that show separately a negativeεand negativeμ.
The resulting composite structure thus possesses a negative refractive index [i.e., the
negative square root, n = -(εμ)1/2 ]. All the approaches performed so far are
concentrated on the designing of the NIM structure with complicated geometry.12-18
Theoretical studies are often complemented by numerical simulations for the detailed
analysis of various structures. The corresponding numerical methods were compared
and applied to various artificial NIM structures, such as slab configuration, nanowire
configuration, wire and split ring resonators and some photonic crystals. For example,
a meta-material consisting of a two-dimensional array of repeated unit cells of copper
strips and split ring resonators on interlocking strips of a standard circuit board was
reported to exhibit a negative index of refraction at microwave frequencies.12 An
approximate analytical theory based on the group velocity (Eω/Eκ) has proved that
the negative values of ε and μ were found on a two-dimensional photonic crystal
made from a non-magnetic dielectric.13 A new material made by Pimenov et al
consists of a multilayer stack of ferromagnetic manganese oxide and superconducting
copper oxide thin films, and a negative refractive index was obtained when an
external magnetic field of 3 Tesla was applied.14 Shalaev et al reported a thin sheet
meta-material comprising two layers of silver separated by alumina. The structure is
perforated with a regular array of rectangular-shaped holes to create a fishnet
pattern.15 Negative indices were achieved with the use of ultrathin Au-Si3N4-Ag
waveguide sustaining a surface plasma polariton mode with anti-parallel group and
phase velocities.16 Yao et al reported bulk meta-materials made of nanowires could
exhibite negative refraction for all incident angles in the visible region.17 While in our
study, we prepare the NIMs through a chemical formulation method which is totally
different from the previous approaches mentioned above. Our method is much easier
and could drastically reduce the fabrication costs.
The negative dielectric permittivity is a very important key for creating
materials with a negative refractive index. The main objective of our current research
is to develop polymer composite materials with huge negativeε. On the other hand, a
negative index of refraction can occur when only the permittivity of the material is
integral capacitor technology, electro-active devices and electromagnetic
interference(EMI). In these studies, negativeεvalues have been observed when we
follow certain synthetic routes and fabrication procedures. In this report, PANI is
synthesized via emulsion polymerization of aniline monomer in an oil/water mixed
solvent medium (such as n-hexane/water or xylene/water system), and DBSA serves
as an emulsifier and a dopant to PANI formed. The emulsion polymerization reaction
was proceeded in a medium consisting of reversed micelles, if the amount of organic
solvent used is much larger than that of water (see ESI Scheme (b)). Then the freshly
obtained PANI-DBSA solution is blended with PAA solution, which acts as a
suspension agent. 30, 31 In a typical run, we take the preparation of a PANI-DBSA/PAA
nano-composite containing 16 wt% of PANI as an example. To a solution of 2.804 g
(8.6 mmole) of DBSA in 500 mL of n-hexane cooled to 0-3℃, 0.8 g (8.6 mmole) of
aniline was added drop-wise with gentle stirring for 1 h. Then a solution of 1.96 g (8.6
mmole) of APS (ammonium peroxydisulfate, as an initiator) in 10 mL of de-ionized
water was added drop-wise to the aniline-DBSA mixture, with stirring at 0-3℃ for 8
h. The original milky mixture turned into a dark green solution at the end of the
polymerization reaction, and the PANI-DBSA complex solution was thus obtained.
Next, place 5.0 g of PAA and 10 mL of de-ionized water into a 3-necked round bottle
flask equipped with a distillation apparatus; the freshly prepared PANI-DBSA mixture
was charged to the flask with agitation, and the bulk temperature was maintained at ca.
85℃ in order to distill away all the n-hexane (b.p. 69℃). An aqueous
PANI-DBSA/PAA dispersion was obtained and was ready for use in fabricating the
test devices. Test specimens were prepared by spin-coating a preheated glass
plate(~100℃) with the PANI-DBSA/PAA dispersion one layer at a time. Sample with
a thickness of ca. 0.5 mm was obtained by applying about 15-30 layers. The specimen
was dried in an oven at 80℃ for 24 h. The synthesis of PAA samples and the
experimental techniques for SEM and dielectric/conductivity measurements have
been reported earlier.28, 29
Figure 1 depicts the variation ofεof PANA-DBSA/PAA nano-composites,
plotted with respected to PANI contents and the AC frequencies applied. The results
show that a negativeεwas obtained for all the nano-composites containing more than
6 wt% of PANI. In the sample containing 6 wt% of PANI, ε value changed from ca.
-1.0 x 105 to ca. - 5.0 x 102 as the frequency increased from 0.5 kHz to 10 MHz. For
the samples with higher contents of PANI,εvalue changed from ca -1.0 ~ -1.6 x 106
to ca. - 8.0 x 102 ~ - 2.0 x 103 as the frequency switched from 0.5 kHz to 10 MHz.
Just like the cases that reported in the patent mentioned above about
poly(benzimidazole)(PBI ) doped with phosphoric acid solution,26 as well as that the
nano-colloids of (BRTCO) nano-particles suspended in silicone oil,24, 25 the negative
conducted a parallel study-synthesis of PANI-DBSA in an aqueous medium (i.e.,
emulsion reaction occurs in regular micelles, see ESI Scheme 1(a)). The
PANI-DBSA/PAA composites formed by this process exhibit a totally different
picture on their dielectric and conductivity behaviors, i.e., a positiveεvalue and
a much lowerσ. For instance, a sample with 30 wt% of PANI gives a εvalue
of 9.78 x 104, whereas a value of -1.6 x 106 is obtained for the sample of the
same formulation prepared by previous reversed micelle process. Meanwhile,
this composite exhibits a different morphological structure as compared to the
composite prepared from organic medium, as shown in the SEM micrographs
(Fig. 2 vs. Fig. S2 in ESI). The dispersion curves of the permittivity (ESI Fig.
S1), of the conductivity (Fig. 3) and the SEM images ( ESI Fig. S2) of these
composites were included for comparison.
In addition, we have developed another PANI nano-composite
system-PANI-DBSA/epoxy by an adsorption- transferring process, which can
exhibit a negative permittivity as well. In this part of work, an epoxy prepolymer
(DGEBA, diglycidyl ether of biphenol-A) pre-cured by aniline monomer
(DGEBA-aniline) was added to a freshly prepared PANI nano-particle aqueous
solution with vigorous agitation and heating (ca. 90℃). The DGEBA-aniline is
insoluble in water and is viscous at this stage. The PANI nano-particles were
absorbed on the surface of epoxy droplets and then transferred into the whole
droplet. The final cured PANI-DBSA/epoxy nano-composite was obtained after
curing at 90℃ for 4 h. A remarkable advantage of this process is that no organic
solvent was used in the whole process. The dispersion curves of the permittivity,
and the SEM images of these nano-composites were included in ESI part, along
with the schematic representation of the absorption-transferring process (see ESI
Fig. S3(b), Fig. S4, & Scheme 2). As shown in these figures, the
PANI-DBSA/epoxy nano-composites containing 28 and 33 wt% of PANI
possessed the lowest negative ε (i.e., the highest absolute values) of ca. -1.3 x
10 5 and ca. -1.15 x 105, respectively, measured at a frequency of 1 kHz. The
SEM micrographs of these nano-composites revealed that the PANI-DBSA
particles with an average size of 30 ~ 50 nm, distributed quite homogeneously in
the epoxy matrix, just like in the case of PANI-DBSA/PAA system (Figs. 2 (b),
(c) & (d)) . Similarly, the well-dispersed PANI-DBSA nano-particles provide a
continuous conduction network and cause a large scale of charge delocalization.
Therefore, negativeεwas generated. Incidentally, when this PANI-DBSA/epoxy
composite was prepared by other process, such as a simple blending process,
negative permittivity was not found (see ESI Fig. S3(a)). This result is
understandable based on the SEM study of its morphology (ESI Fig. S4 vs. Fig.
