ABSTRACT 
Drilled shaft is advantageous for its low noise and vibration during installation. Soil profile with multiple 
soil layers is often encountered in several metropolises around the world.  Analysis and design of drilled 
shafts in this type of soil should consider resistances contributed from different soil types.  For reliability 
based design, the multiple resistance factor design (MRFD) format is the realistic approach, so that different 
level of safety measure required for clay, sand, gravel, and rock layers can be considered.  Although MRFD 
formats have been recommended for various shallow and deep foundation designs, calibration again data with 
foundations penetrating multiple geomaterials is still lacking.  In this study, the MRFD factors are developed 
based on a load test database of drilled shafts in multiple strata.  The correlations models for unit side 
resistance are re-examined based on an expanded global database, and the  transformation uncertainty for 
each model is evaluated.  The resulting MRFD factors are found to be non-uniform, but simple regression 
equations can be developed to determine the calibrated MRFD factors.

respectively.  The side resistance in a given layer, denoted by Sx (the subscript ‘x’ denotes 
either ‘c’, ‘s’, ‘g’, or ‘r’, depending on the stratum type of interest), can be computed as:

where B = shaft diameter.  The foundation depth is discretized into N layers for each 
stratum type, whereas fsi is the unit side resistance for the ith layer and ti is the thickness of the 
ith layer.  With Eq. (3), the basic element to be estimated is the unit side resistance. 
 
3 Database  
To develop the MRFD format for drilled shafts installed in multiple strata, case histories of 
load tests will be used.  The typical ground profile in the Taipei metropolitan area consists of 
interbeded silty clay and silty sand overlying gravel and/or sandstone/mudstone.  A drilled 
shaft installed in Taipei may pass through up to four stratum types within the depth of the 
shaft.   Hence, a database consists of load tests in Taipei area is suitable for the purpose of 
this study.  A total of 42 cases were compiled in the database, all with sufficient site and soil 
information and at least the butt load-displacement curve.  The diameter of the drilled shafts 
in the database ranges from 0.8 to 2.5 m, the depth of the shafts range mostly from 20.7 m to 
76 m, and the depth to diameter ratio (D/B) of these shafts ranges from 18.8 to 63.3.  
Because the strata that a shaft passes through varies, the database are further classified into 
Six groups: (a) Group ALL: the strata include clay, sand, gravel, and rock layers; (b) Group 
CSR: the strata include clay, sand, and rock layers; (c) Group CSG: the strata include clay, 
sand, and gravel layers; (d) Group CGR: the strata include clay, gravel, and rock layers; (e) 
Group CR: the strata include clay and rock layers; and (f) Group CS: the strata include clay 
and sand layers. 
 
4 Probabilistic Models for Unit Side Resistance 
For reliability-based calibration, the probabilistic correlation models must be developed.  For 
drilled shafts installed in multiple strata (e.g., clay, sand, gravel, and rock layers), the 
contribution of different stratum types to the axial capacity is evaluated separately.  For each 
type of geomaterials, various analysis models are available (e.g., Reese and O’Neil 1988, 
Chen and Kulhawy 1994, Phoon and Kulhawy 2002, Rollins et al. 2005, Brown et al. 2010).  
In this study, a set of commonly used correlation models as given in Table 1 were selected for 
clay, sand, gravel, and rock, respectively.   
In this study, existing correlation models were re-examined and updated using available 
data from previous studies and those obtained from the Taipei database.  Among the 42 
Taipei shafts, 22 were instrumented load tests that information for reducing mobilized unit 
resistance is available.  These data provided additional information for quantifying the 
correlation models and their transformation uncertainties.  Details on the study of axial 
behavior of the Taipei shafts and the examination of pertinent correlation models are out of

The ratio of the predicted total side resistance (Sp) over the interpreted “failure” loads 
(QST or QL2) is plotted versus the shaft ratio (D/B) in Figure 2.  As can be seen, the 
prediction is consistent over the depth range, although some variability exists.  On average, 
the predicted side resistance is approximately 0.99 times the QST and 0.81 times the QL2.  
Analysis of the instrumented tests where the side and tip resistances can be separated provides 
information for mobilized side and tip resistance at the interpreted load level.  The available 
data in the database suggested that on average the side resistance contributed approximately 
83% of the interpreted QST and 80% of the interpreted QL2.  It is hence suggested that the 
prediction model overestimates the side resistance at the QST level, where the estimated side 
resistance is approximately at the QL2 level for the Taipei data.

7 Conclusion 
The multiple resistance factor design (MRFD) for drilled shafts considering the varying 
contribution of resistance from different geomaterials is discussed in this paper.  Calibration 
of the MRFD factors is based on a database of drilled shafts in Taipei region, which provides 
case histories of shafts in multiple strata.  The resulting MRFD factors are found to be 
non-uniform, which is sensible because the resistance factor associated with unit side 
resistance transformation equation of less uncertainty (e.g. clay) should be larger and vice 
versa.  This study further provides simple regression equations for determination of the 
calibrated MRFD factors.  These equations were based on the unit side resistance correlation 
models that are carefully calibrated by augmented global databases.  The calibration for the 
MRFD factors considers not only the transformation uncertainties in the correlation models 
but also the measurement errors in the geotechnical parameters.  These equations were also 
based on carefully chosen case studies involving drilled shaft load tests in Taipei with a large 
diversity in soil profiles.  As a result, these equations should be suitable for designs in soil 
profiles commonly encountered in Taipei.
