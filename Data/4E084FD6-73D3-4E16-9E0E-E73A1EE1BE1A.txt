Fig. 2 shows the proposed detection 
system. The detection system takes the N 
data as the input, followed by the SA 
parameter detection system to detect a set of 
parameter vectors of K patterns. After 
convergence, K patterns are recovered from 
the detected parameter vectors.

SA parameter detection system consists 
of two main parts: 1. definition of system 
error (energy, distance); 2. SA algorithm for 
determination of the parameter vectors with 
minimum error. To obtain the system error, 
we calculate the error or the distance from a 
point to patterns, and combine the errors 
from all points to patterns to be the system 
error.

Step 3: Cool the System. 
Decrease temperature T according to the 
cooling function, T(t) = Tmax × 0.98(t-1), 
for t = 1, 2, 3, …, to the next cooling 
cycle and repeat Step 2 and 3 until the 
temperature is low enough, for examples, 
repeat 500 times. 
 
 
 
(b) Experimental Results 
 
The detection system is applied to detect 
the lines, circles and ellipses in the image. 
The image size is 50×50. Each pattern has 
50 points. Data are disturbed by Gaussian 
noise with zero mean and variance is 0.5, 
N(0, 0.5) × N(0, 0.5). Fig. 4. Detection of a circle and an ellipse, K 
= 2. In initial stage, mx and my are randomly 
distributed over (0, 50), fk = 0, ak = 1, bk = 1, 
and θk = 0. The cooling function is T(t) = 
Tmax × 0.98(t-1), for t = 1, 2, 3, …, with a high 
enough temperature, Tmax = 500. We have 
100 trials in one temperature. The 
temperature decreases 500 times to T = 
0.0209, and this temperature is low enough. 
Set constants, αm = 1, αab = 1, αθ = 2, and αf 
= 2.

2) Distance from a Point to a Pattern 
Here the detected patterns include line, circle, ellipse, and 
hyperbola, the distance from a point xi to the kth pattern is 
defined as 
kkik
T
kiik rd −−−= )()()( cxAcxx  (3) 
with |det(Ak)|=1. For hyperbola, Ak is negative definite, 
(xi-ck)TAk(xi-ck) may be negative. So we take absolute value 
before square root. This definition makes computation 
feasible, especially in hyperbolic detection. 
B. Distance from a Point to K Patterns 
Error or distance from a point to the patterns is defined as 
the product of the distances from the point to all patterns. The 
error of the ith point xi is 
),()...()...()()( 21 iKikiiii ddddEE xxxxx ==  (4) 
where K is the total number of patterns. If the point is on any 
pattern, the error of this point will be zero. Fig. 2 shows the 
error of a point to all patterns. The distance layer computes 
the distance from a point to each pattern by (3), and the error 
layer outputs the error from a point to all patterns by (4).

D. Simulated Annealing Parameter Detection System 
We use SA to detect the parameter vector of each pattern. 
Our goal is to find a set of parameter vectors that can globally 
minimize the error of the system. Using the temperature 
decreasing function T(t) 
T(t)= Tmax /ln(1+t)    for t=1, 2, 3, …,            (6) 
can converge to global minimum with probability 1 [9]. 
Adjusting all parameters at one time is not efficient in 
convergence [6]. We use three steps in adjusting parameters 
also. The adjusting order is the center, the shape matrix A, 
and then the size r. In order to get fast convergence, we use 
the accepted counts to change the adjusting amount [10]. The 
algorithm is in the following. 
Algorithm: SA to detect parameter vectors of K patterns. 
Input: N points in an image. 
Output: A set of detected K parameter vectors. 
Steps: 
Step 1: Initialization. 
At initial step t=1, choose T(1)=Tmax/ln(2) at high 
temperature, and define the temperature decreasing 
function 
T(t)= Tmax /ln(1+t)    for t=1, 2, 3, …, 
Initialize parameter vectors p1, p2, ..., pk, …, pK, where pk 
= [ck,x, c k,y, a k,11, a k,12, a k,21, a k,22, r k]T, one p is for one 
pattern, and set P = (p1, p2, ..., pk, …, pK). 
 Calculate energy E(P) as (5). 
Step 2: Randomly change parameter vectors and decide the 
new parameter vectors in the same temperature. 
For m = 1 to Nr (adjust the step size Nr times in a 
temperature) 
For j = 1 to Ns (adjust the step size per Ns trials) 
For k = 1 to K (k is the index of the pattern) 
(a) Randomly change the center of the kth pattern: 
ckck
T
ykxk
T
k,yxk sccc'c' ,,,,, ] []  [ v+=  (7) 
where vk,c is a 2×1 random vector with its elements are 
uniformly distributed over (0, 1), and sk,c is the step size. 
Now, p’k = [c’k, x, c’k, y, ak,11, ak,12, ak,21, ak,22, rk]T, and P’= 
(p1, p2, …, p’k, …, pK). 
Calculate the new energy E(P’) from N points to K 
patterns. Using Metropolis criterion decides whether or 
not to accept P’. Metropolis criterion is a rule [11]: for the 
new energy less than or equal to the original one, ∆E = 
E(P’) - E(P) ≤ 0, accept P’. Otherwise, new energy is 
higher than the original one, ∆E = E(P’) - E(P) > 0. In this 
case, compute prob = exp(-∆E/T(t)), and generate a 
random number x uniformly distributed over (0, 1). If 
prob ≥ x, accept P’; otherwise, reject it, and keep P. 
If P’ is accepted, increase the number of acceptance for 
the adjusting center of the kth pattern, Nk,c = Nk,c+1.

where vk,A is a 4×1 random vector with its elements are 
uniformly distributed over (0, 1) and sk,A is the step size. 
Then, [a’k,11, a’ k,12, a’ k,21, a’ k,22]T is normalized by the

Result of detecting circles and ellipses are shown in Fig. 6. 
Each pattern has 50 points with Gaussian noise N(0, 
0.5)×N(0, 0.5). Figures of energy vs. cooling cycles are also 
shown. 
B. Detection of Hyperbolas 
For a hyperbola, matrix A in (2) is negative definite and 
det(A)<0. Moreover, in a seismogram, hyperbola is always 
North-South vertical opening and non-rotated patterns. So we 
constrain the parameters to be a11<0, a12=0, a21=0, and a22>0, 
and size r≥0. Then, the parameter vector becomes 
p = [cx, cy, a11, a22, r]T  (18) 
and the distance calculation is in (3). 
We initialize that cx and cy are randomly distributed over (0, 
50), and a11= -1, a22=1, r=0 for hyperbolic pattern detection, 
and the cooling schedule is the same as the previous setting. 
Fig. 7 shows the results of hyperbolic pattern detection, 
where Fig.7 (a) has 187 points and Fig. 7 (b) has 146 points. 
Each data is with Gaussian noise N(0, 0.5)×N(0, 0.5).

Fig. 7.  Detection of hyperbolas − (a)-(b): 2 hyperbolas with noise. (c)-(d): 
corresponding plot of error vs. cooling cycle of (a) and (b). 
C. Seismic Applications 
Experiments have two cases: horizontal reflection layer 
and dipping reflection layer. Two lines are the asymptote of 
the hyperbola [3], and the asymptote is a hyperbola with the 
same shape but small size or size zero. So the asymptote can 
be treated as a hyperbola. 
Fig. 8 (a) shows a one-shot seismogram from horizontal 
reflection layer. The two-sided one-shot seismogram has 65 
receiving stations with 50 meters between each others, and 
512 samples with sampling interval 0.004 seconds. The 
one-shot seismogram is first preprocessed by envelope 
processing and thresholding [5] as in Fig. 8 (b). The image 
size is 512×65. The points are then used as the input to the 
parameter detection system. The initial parameter c = (20, 20), 
a11=−1, a22=1, and r=0. The cooling function is as (6) with a 
high enough temperature, Tmax=0.4. The cooling schedule is 
Ns=20 for the step adjustment, and repeat Nr=5 times in a 
temperature. The temperature decreases 1,000 times. The 
result and the error plot are shown in Fig. 8 (c) and (d). The 
detection of direct wave and reflection wave from the dipping 
reflection layer is shown in Fig. 9. 
Table I and II list the detected parameters for the above two 
seismic experiments. Comparing parameters of direct wave 
and hyperbolic wave in each experiment, the matrices A of 
both patterns are almost the same. Direct wave pattern is the 
asymptote of a hyperbola.
