Abstract 
       A new PCP tri-block copolymer consisting of poly (e-caprolactone)- b- 
chitooligosaccharide- b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PCL- b- COS-b-PEG, PCP) was 
synthesized and characterized. The potential for delivering doxorubicin (DOX), a 
model drug, with or without genipin crosslinking was evaluated. The PCP 
copolymers were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) to 
confirm the amine and ester groups of the COS and the PCL of the copolymer, 
respectively. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) was performed to 
determine the structure of the PCP copolymer for demonstrating both PCL and 
PEG blocks grafted onto the COS block. Moreover, gel permeation 
chromatography (GPC) was applied to determine the number average molecular 
weight of the tri-block copolymer (Mn), which was 11,340 Da/mole. The PCP 
form polymeric micelles at the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 0.0107 
wt% (or 1.0 lM) with the mean diameter 90 nm, as determined by a dynamic 
light-scattering (DLS) analyzer. Since PCP micelles contain COS, the zeta 
potentials of the micelles are changed from a neutral (e.g., _3.2 ± 1.3 mV at pH 
7.4) to a cationic state (13.9 ± 4.4 mV at pH 3.0) when pH values of the 
suspension medium are varied. This change is a unique property of the micelles. 
In addition, drug delivery behavior of the PCP micelles is influenced by genipin 
crosslinking COS. The DOX release period of crosslinked micelles is significantly 
longer than that of the non-crosslinked ones (e.g., 8 days vs. 4 days, respectively) 
while the burst release of DOX of crosslinked ones is significantly reduced 
compared with that of non-crosslinked ones. In conclusion, a new tri-block 
COS-containing PCP copolymer/polymeric micelle has been synthesized and 
characterized. Moreover, the unique properties of COS-containing PCP micelles 
are demonstrated by varying zeta potentials via changing pH of medium and by 
influencing DOX delivering behaviors after genipin crosslinking.

器可測得此一微小的物理變化值，進而判斷溶解於溶液中之雙性高分子於多少濃度時產
生聚集現象[1]。微胞由數十至數百各界面活性劑分子聚集而成，通常為球形，但於不同
的溶液下，會有不同的物理性質，如表面張力和電導度等，會使型態產生顯著的變更。 
 
圖一 聚合物微胞示意圖 
1-4 微胞於醫學上之應用 
基本上聚合物微胞是由兩性或以上之共聚物所組成，同時包含有親水性與疏水性的
成份，這些微胞當到達一定濃度時，會形成內核-外核形式的結構，疏水性的物質聚集成
內部的核(Core), 而親水性的物質則在外圍形成保護的外層(Layer)，或稱其為暈(Corona) 
。 利用這些嵌段共聚物所形成之微胞，微胞直徑大約在20-200nm，內核中利用物理方式
或以化學鍵結方法可裝載疏水性藥物或是吸附DNA，當微胞進入血液循環系統時，微胞
受到外殼部分之聚乙二醇之保護且也則因其具有無毒與易溶於水之特性，因此可以避免
被網狀內皮系統(Reticuloendothelial systems, RES)所偵測與吞噬。而nakanishi學者更提出
enhanced permeation and retention, EPR效應，由於帶有腫瘤組織之血液循環系統中因組織
間細較大，因此微胞可經由滲透或其它機制穿越進入腫瘤組織而累積於此。若為胞攜帶
有治療性藥物時則可達到藥物標地之目的[2]，如圖二所示。

    實驗流程圖如下： 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       由於微胞在水溶液系統中是以單分子形態以及微胞形態共存而達到熱力學平衡狀
態，為了提高微胞之穩定性，在本研究中選用天然的交聯劑-綠梔子素(genipin)PCP微胞進
行交聯反應。本研究中所合成之PCP聚合物分子鏈段中具有自由胺基，當於水溶液中形成
微胞時，微胞結構中之自由胺基即可與genipin反應而形成一部份交聯狀之結構。

3-4.3-1 PC12細胞培養 
       PC12細胞株為大鼠腎上腺之嗜鉻細胞瘤細胞。未分化的PC12細胞可視為不具功能性
的神經細胞，於組織培養時可以不斷的分裂。經過神經生長因子刺激後，會進行分化作用，
在外觀上會具有神經突觸的外生與分枝現象，而使細胞產生功能性。由於PC12細胞有類
似神經細胞的特性，可被廣泛用於神經生物學的研究，並且可經由組織培養而大量分裂。
本研究中PC12細胞株取自於食研所菌種中心，細胞株來源為ATCC CRL-1721。

五、結論 
此三年期計畫，我們合成出 PCL-COS-PEG三嵌段的共聚物(PCP共聚物)；利用幾丁
寡醣的 NH2基特色，以達成目標。經各項材料測詴分析，PCP 成功的被合成，並且有奈
米微胞的特色，具 pH改變的電荷應答性；且經由 genipin的交聯，使含 DOX之 PCP微
胞，具更高的穩定性。另外，以 RGD接枝於 PCP上，形成 RGD-PCP微胞，對 PC12細
胞的胞飲作用，反應敏感，比 PCP及常用的 liposome更快，具有更高的標靶作用性。本
計畫成功的製備具高度”聰明性”的奈米微胞藥載系統。

Poly(-Caprolactone)-b-Chitooligosaccharide-b-Poly(Ethylene Glycol) (PCP) Copolymer Micelles Chung et al.
polymers are usually adopted as the hydrophilic segments
of micelles4–6 to provide a brush-like stability corona
to increase the circulatory half-time of micelles in the
blood stream.78 For instance, PEO-b-PDLLA, PLGA-
PEG, and PEG-PCL copolymers and micelles have been
reported.14578 However, the copolymer chains of such
polyester-PEG-based micelles have no functional groups,
such as amine groups, to be chemically modiﬁed, nor
can the surface characteristics of the micelles be changed.
Accordingly, this study prepares the micelles that contain
functional groups such as amine groups in their constituent
copolymers, and explores the effects of the crosslinking of
the groups on the delivery of DOX.
A tri-block copolymer that not only can self-assemble
to form micelles with a hydrophobic core such as PCL
and hydrophilic shell such as PEG as reported by other
researchers17–9 but also contains amine groups was syn-
thesized by selecting an oligomer of chitosan, COS, as the
third components. That is, PCL-b-COS-b-PEG (PCP) tri-
block copolymer was ﬁrstly synthesized and the character-
istics of micelles for DOX, a model drug, with or without
crosslinked amine groups were studied.
COS generally consists fewer than ten D-glucosamine
and N -acetyl-D-glucosamine units and is obtained by either
the chemical or the enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan310
which consists of 2-amino-2-deoxy-(1-4 )-D-glucose-
amine units and few or no N -acetyl-D-glucosamine units.
COS biologically exhibits favorable biocompatibility and
biodegradability and, chemically, includes ﬁnite numbers
of hydroxyl and amine groups of the D-glucosamine units
for chemical modiﬁcations as those of chitosan.11–13
In this synthesis of the PCP copolymers, the PCL
and PEG are region-selectively reacted with the hydroxyl
groups of C6 and C3 (Scheme 1), leaving the amine
groups of the D-glucosamine units of COS after reac-
tion by N -phthaloylation and de-N -phthaloylation process,
respectively.
To characterize the PCP copolymers, FT-IR spectra were
used to verify the existences of amine and ester groups for
COS and PCL in PCP, respectively. 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H NMR) was applied to conﬁrm the structure
of COS binding with PCL and PEG polymers, and gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine
the molecular weight of intermediates and PCP. Moreover,
the characteristics of the PCP micelles were determined
from the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the size and
morphology of micelles, using ﬂuorescent methods, DLC,
and TEM, respectively.
The micelles were post-crosslinked by genipin, a nat-
ural crosslink agent to crosslink the amine groups of
proteins or polysaccharides, such as gelatin or chitosan,
respectively,1415 to study the effects of crosslinking amine
groups of PCP on DOX delivery. For comparisons, the
delivery characteristics such as the encapsulation efﬁ-
ciency and release proﬁle of DOX loaded micelles with or
without post-crosslinked of amine groups at different pH
dissolution mediums were studied.
2. MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL
METHODS
COS with at least 95% de-acetylation and molecular
weight about 2000 Da/mole was purchased from Dalwoo-
chitosan (Dalwoo Corp., Korea). -caprolactone (CL)
monomer, methoxy-polyethylene glycol (m-PEG) with a
number-average molecular weight of 2000, hexamethylene
diisocyanate (HMDI), dibutyltin dilaurate (T12), stannous
octoate (SnOct), 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), and
dimethyl-d6-sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) were obtained from
Aldrich (Ardrich Chem. Co., USA). All of those materials
were used as received. Dodecyl alcohol (DA), phthalic
anhydride (PA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N -methyl
Pyrrolidone (NMP), ethyl ether, and ethyl alcohol were
purchased from Fluka Co. (Fluka Co., USA). N ,N -
dimethyl-formamide (DMF), chloroform, tetrahydrofuran
(THF), and methanol were purchased from Tedia Co.
(Tedia Co., USA). Doxorubicin-HCL (DOX) was pur-
chased from ICN (ICN Biomedical Inc., CA, USA). Tri-
ethylamine was purchased from Aldrich (Sigma-Ardrich
Laborchemikalien, GmbH., Germany). All solvents were
HPLC grade.
2.1. Phthaloylation of COS of Blocked Amine Groups
The procedures for preparing N -phthaloylation of COS
(Pth-COS) were based on those of Kurita et al.
1112 with
some modiﬁcations (Scheme 1). Firstly, 10 mmol of COS
was suspended in 30 ml of solvent that contained DMF
95% (v/v) and water 5% (v/v). Then, 30 mmol of PA was
added to the suspensions and heated at 130 C in an atmo-
sphere of nitrogen with stirring. After 1 hr of the reaction,
the resulting pale tan mixture was cooled to room tem-
perature and precipitated in ice water. After the precipi-
tate had been ﬁltered, washed in de-ionized water, and the
un-reacted species of the precipitate were removed with
ethanol and ethyl ether in a Soxhlet extractor for eight hrs,
it was dried to yield the products, a pale tan solid.
2.2. Synthesizing Hydroxy-Terminated
Poly(-Caprolactone) (m-PCL)
The m-PCL was prepared as described by the work of Kim
et al.16 with modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, 3 mol of CL monomer
and 0.3 mol of DA in the presence of SnOct, as a catalyst,
were reacted at 140 C for 3 hrs for ring-opened poly-
merization. The reacted products were dissolved in chlo-
roform, and then precipitated in dehydrated ethyl ether to
obtain polymerized m-PCL and the residual solvent was
removed in a vacuum for over 48 hrs.
The molecular weight of m-PCL was determined using
a GPC at 80 C in NMP at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml min−1

(Mw) of the tested samples were based on a linear cal-
ibration curve of six molecular weights of polystyrene
standards with Mn value of 1260, 3370, 13,900, 30,300,
52,400, and 189,000. The molecular weight (Mw) of the
synthesized m-PCL was measurement to be 2300.
2.3. Preparing PCL-NCO and PEG-NCO Polymers
A mixture of 10 mmol of HMDI and 10 mmol of syn-
thesized m-PCL was dissolved in 45 g of DMF, reacted
at 50 C in the presence of T12, as a catalyst, in an
atmosphere of nitrogen for 8 hrs to prepare PCL-NCO.
The solution product, PCL-NCO, was isolated by precip-
itation in dehydrated ethyl ether and the residual solvent
was removed in a vacuum and stored in an atmosphere of
dehydrated nitrogen.
PEG-NCO was prepared by dissolving a mixture of
10 mmol HMDI and 10 mmol m-PEG (Mw, 2000) was
dissolved in 40.3 g of DMF, and reacting the solution at
50 C in the presence of T12, as a catalyst, in an atmo-
sphere of nitrogen for 8 hrs. The procedure of purifying
PEG-NCO solution was the same as that for purifying
PCL-NCO.
2.4. Synthesizing PCL-Pth-COS-PEG
Copolymers (P-Pth-C-P)
10 mmol of the PCL-NCO solution was slowly added to
12 g of DMSO with 10 mmol of Pth-COS in the presence
of T12 in a three-neck ﬂask in a nitrogen atmosphere. The
ﬂask was then heated at 60 C to induce the chemical reac-
tions between the hydroxyl groups of Pth-COS and PCL-
NCO (Scheme 1). This reaction had proceeded for eight
hours, 10 mmol of PEG-NCO solution was slowly added
to the ﬂask to react with the residual hydroxyl groups of
Pth-COS at 60
C for eight hrs (Scheme 1). The prod-
ucts of the reaction were dissolved in 1 L of THF, and
then precipitated in dehydrated ethyl ether in an ice bath.
The precipitated products were ﬁltered and further dried
in vacuo to remove the residual solvent at room tempera-
ture for more than 48 hrs.
2.5. Preparing PCP Copolymers by
de-Phthaloylation (N-Pth)
The N -Pth groups of the P-Pth-C-P copolymers were selec-
tively removed by using hydrazine hydrate as described by
Nishiyama et al. Brieﬂy, 20 g of P-Pth-C-P copolymer was
suspended in 50 ml of hydrazine hydrate and heated in a
nitrogen atmosphere at 100 C for 1 hr (Scheme 1). After
the reactions, the mixture was cooled to room tempera-
ture, ﬁltered and washed with ethyl ether. The remaining
solid products, which contained PCP copolymer, were fur-
ther extracted by using dehydrated ethyl ether in a Soxhlet
extractor for 8 hrs, and dried in vacuo at room temperature
for at least 48 hrs.
2.6. Purifying PCP Copolymers
The PCP copolymer was dissolved in DMSO at 50 C for
30 min to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 wt%. It was
ﬁrstly dialyzed for several days at 50 C against DMSO
using a membrane with a cut-off molecular weight of
6–8 KDa/mole (Spectrum Medical Industries Inc., USA)
to remove un-reacted hydrophobic PCL, PA, and other
wanted polymers. Then, the DMSO medium was replaced
with distilled water without changing the membrane, dia-
lyzing was performed a few more days at 4 C to remove
un-reacted hydrophilic COS, PEG, and DMSO solvent.
The puriﬁed PCP copolymer solution was ﬁltered through
a membrane of 0.22 m pores, and then freeze-dried for
further characterization and application. To investigate the
possibility of degradation of PCP copolymers and residue
polymers during puriﬁcation process by membrane dialy-
sis, the molecules of the outlet of the dialysis membrane
were analyzed using a by high-resolution mass spectrum
(HRMS) (Finnigan/Thermo Quest MAT, USA) to inves-
tigate the possibility of degradation of PCP copolymers
during puriﬁcation process by membrane dialysis.
2.7. Characterizing Intermediates and Products
During the Synthesis of PCP Copolymers
The molecular weight of the synthesized m-PCL, reac-
tion intermediates such as PCL-COS and PCP copoly-
mers were determined by using GPC, as described in
the section on m-PCL synthesis. FT-IR absorption spectra
of synthesized m-PCL, PCL-COS, and PCP co-polymers
were analyzed by using an FT-IR spectrum analyzer (Dig-
ilab. FTS-3000MX, Digilab Corp., MA, USA), collected
at a resolution of 2 cm−1, and analyzed using a built-in
standard software package to characterize the functional
groups including amine and carbonyl.
The shift in the 1H NMR signals associated with the
molecular structure of reaction intermediates and PCP
copolymers were determined using a Varian Unity Inova
(Varian Inc., CA, USA) at 600 MHz as other groups.17–19
The 1H NMR of COS and PCP were determined in DMSO
at 80 C.
2.8. Preparing PCP Micelles and Determining
CMC of the Micelles
Micelles of PCP were prepared by direct dissolution
method.20 Generally, 1 mg of PCP copolymer was suspen-
ded in distilled water at 40 C for 1 hr to induce self-
assembly of PCP copolymers in micelle form. They were
then ﬁltered through a membrane with a pore size of
0.22 m. The ﬁltrated suspension was further equilibrated
for 5 hrs at room temperature. The CMC value of the
PCP micelles was determined as reported.46 Brieﬂy, 20 l
of 0.4 mM DPH dissolved in methanol was injected into
2.0 ml of PCP copolymer suspensions with concentrations

the crosslinking of micelles by genipin were applied as
described elsewhere with modiﬁcations. 0.7 ml of 1.0 wt%
genipin solution14–15 was added to 7 ml of a DOX-loaded
PCP micelle suspension at 37 C to crosslink the amine
groups of the micelles (Scheme 2). After the crosslinking
reactions, the suspensions were dialyzed using a col-
umn ﬁlter (Column #: X11S-200-04N, Spectrum Medi-
cal Industries Inc., USA) to remove the residual genipin,
and concentrate the suspensions. The analysis protocols
for determining encapsulation efﬁciency, loading percent-
age, and the release study of DOX for the crosslinked PCP
micelles were the same as those for non-crosslinked PCP
micelles.
The statistical analysis of student t-test was performed
using Sigmastat statistical software (Jandel Science Corp.,
San Rafael, CA, USA). Statistical signiﬁcance corre-
sponded to a conﬁdence level of 95% or better. Triply
measured data or more are presented as mean ± SD.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
High-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS) was used to
investigate the possibility of residual polymers and degra-
dation of PCP copolymers during puriﬁcation process by
membrane dialysis. To investigate the possibility of degra-
dation of PCP copolymers and residue polymers during
puriﬁcation process by a membrane dialysis, the molecules
of the outlet of the dialysis membrane were analyzed using
a by. The results showed that no residual polymers and
degradation product were further detected after three days
of dialysis (data not shown).
3.1. Synthesizing and Characterizing the
Intermediates of PCP Copolymers
Figure 1 shows the FT-IR transmittance spectra of COS,
COS-PCL, and PCP copolymers. The transmittance spectra

copolymers, and (c) PCP copolymers; the characteristic peaks/functional
groups of each copolymer are pointed. The spectra of PCP copolymers
exhibit characteristic peaks of ester, amide groups, and C–H stretch of
PCL, COS, and PEG, respectively.
of COS show the characteristic peaks of amide (I) at
1640 cm−1 and the amide (II) band at 1560 cm−1
(Ref. [17]). Moreover, the spectra for COS-PCL (Fig. 1)
show a strong absorption band at 2850 cm−1 ∼ 3000 cm−1
which is due to the C–H stretching band of PCL (e.g.,
2945 cm−1), and a new absorption band at 1700 cm−1
which is attributable to the ester groups of PCL but the
amide (I) and (II) bands are slightly shifted. The spectra
and the peaks were consistent with the observations by
other reporters of PCL grafted onto the hydroxyl groups of
chitosan.19 The spectra of PCP copolymer (e.g., curve c)
exhibit characteristic peaks such as those of ester and
amide groups of PCL, PEG, and COS, respectively. These
are the peaks of the ester groups of PCL at 1720 cm−1
as presented in (b), a much stronger C–H stretching band
at 2850 cm−1 ∼ 3000 cm−1 than that in (a) associated
with the aliphatic C–H stretching of PEG and PCL, and
the slightly shifted amide (I) and amide (II) bands of
COS. FT-IR study of Chitosan-PEG and PCL-PEG-PCL
copolymers1720 revealed the C–H stretching of PCP. The
resulting FT-IR transmittance spectra of the COS-PCL and
PCP copolymers in Figure 1 are evidence of a PCP copoly-
mer that consists of PCL, COS, and PEG polymers.
The molecular weight and the de-acetylation of COS are
about 2000 Da/mole and 95%, respectively, the mean ratio
of n to m of COS is 6∼ 10. To gain insight into the chem-
ical structure of the intermediates and PCP copolymers, 1H
NMR spectra were performed for COS and PCP copoly-
mers. In Figure 2(a), shows the 1H NMR spectra of COS
molecule in DMSO and the peaks correspond to the chem-
ical shifts of the H1 proton in the D-glucosamine unit
of COS. The peaks at 1.58, 3.11, 3.18 ∼ 3.68, 4.05,
and 2.50 ppm are correspondent to the HAc and back-
bone hydrogen of H2–H6 and H1 of COS and DMSO,
respectively.151920 In Figure 2(b) presents the 1H NMR
spectra of PCP copolymers in DMSO; the peaks for the
methylene H of PCL are at 1.20, 1.38, 2.23, 4.06 ppm and
that of DMSO is at 2.50 ppm while the other peaks of PCP
are assigned to COS and PEG. Moreover, the peak at 1.20,
1.38, and 2.95 are the overlaps of the methylene of HMDI
with PCL, and with H2 of COS, respectively, and 5.70 ppm
is primary amide of HMDI, respectively.2122 The multi-
ple peaks in 3.0 to 4.0 ppm are resulted from the over-
lapped between backbone hydrogen of COS and m-PEG
of PCP copolymers, including the peak at 3.30 ppm,
methylene 4 H adjacent to oxygen of ether of m-PEG
of PCP copolymer,1518 which may nevertheless contain
impure H2O.
16 Additionally, the peaks at 1.55, 2.95, and
4.02 ppm are hydrogen backbone of COS. The weak peak
at 7.15 ppm from PCP copolymers is attributable to resid-
ual phthalimido groups, suggesting the very weak and
incomplete de-protection of the amine of COS occurred.
Moreover, the molecular weight (Mw) of PCP copoly-
mer is 12508 Da/mole with polydispersity index of 1.16,
and the structure of the tri-block copolymers veriﬁed from
1H NMR spectra are two segments of PEG and PCL

of synthesized m-PCL synthesized by this laboratory is
2450, so the measurement of molecular weight of PCL-
COS indicates that only two PCL-NCO polymers bind to
hydroxyl groups of N -Pth-COS. Moreover, the molecular
weight of PCP copolymer indicates that only two PEG-
NCO polymers bind to the residual hydroxyl groups of
N -Pth-COS-PCL of the di-block copolymers. The binding
efﬁciencies for PCL-NCO and PEG-NCO with hydroxyl
groups of N -Pth-COS are relatively low, perhaps because
of residual H2O present during the reactions or steric
effects of COS.
3.2. Micellization of PCP Copolymers and
CMC Value
The structure of the PCP copolymer comprises a tri-block
copolymer, so the possibility of forming PCP micelles as
a reservoir for drug delivery or medical applications is
of interest and the objective of this study. The ﬂuores-
cent hydrophobic dye, DPH, a strong chromophore shown
UV-VIS absorption spectra between 350 nm and 415 nm,
was loaded and applied to evaluate the CMC value of
PCP copolymer.6829 Notably, the absorbance of DPH in a
hydrophobic environment greatly exceeds that under aque-
ous conditions, suggesting that the PCL is a hydrophobic
core of the PCP micelles. Figure 3 shows that the CMC
value of the PCP micelles was 107× 10−2 wt% in (e.g.,
107 mg/L or 1.0 M) PCP copolymers, as determined by
extrapolating the difference between the absorbance of the
suspension at 384 and 401 nm, which was plotted against
the logarithmic of the concentration of the PCP copoly-
mers. The CMC value of the PCP micelles is of about one
order of magnitude higher than those values of polyester-
PEG based micelles, as reported by other groups6829 that
may be due to ring structure of COS of PCP copolymers.
Nevertheless, the CMC value is still comparable to those
of other micelle systems. For instance, it has been reported

that the CMC values of the PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO system
ranged between 10 and 1000 mg/L.30
The size and the morphology of the micelles were deter-
mined and examined by using a dynamic light-scattering
(DLS) analyzer and by TEM, respectively (Figs. 4a–c),
to characterize the PCP micelles. The mean diameter of
the PCP micelles measured using the analyzer was 90 nm
(Fig. 4a), and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.35,
suggesting that the sizes of the micelles were narrowly
distributed. Furthermore, the morphologies of the micelles
without or with genipin crosslinked were imaged by TEM
to show the spherical particles with nanometer dimensions
which the sizes ranged from 40 to 120 nm (Figs. 4b–c)
which are consistent with the measurements made by the
particle size analyzer. The polymeric micelles with the
CMC values and the size that range in a low millimolar
region and sizes of 10–100 nm, respectively, are one of
good candidates in drug delivery applications.1 The results
of the CMC value and the nanometer scale of dimensions
of the particles size of the PCP micelles closely are well
ﬁtted to the requirements for of drug delivery.

those releases of the non-crosslinked ones. When pH values
of dissolution mediums are decreased, the release of DOX
of both micelles increase the burst release rates with
reduced release periods (Figs. 6a and 6b). The results of
decreased release periods of DOX in low pH mediums
are similar to others reports2332 that may caused by ionic
of amine groups of DOX. The reduced of burst release,
and the improving the release period of DOX of post-
crosslinked PCP micelles may be caused by the decreased
in the mobility of the COS segment of PCP copolymers,
crosslinked by of amine groups, and then enhancing the sta-
bility of the micelles (data not shown). The little lower total
cumulative release of DOX for the crosslinked micelles
might be caused by the possibly crosslinked between the
amine groups of DOX and COS of PCP micelles.
The encapsulation efﬁciencies and the loading capacity
of DOX in PCP micelles with or without post-crosslinked
are relatively higher than those of micelles assembled by
polyester-PEG di-block copolymers2123 although the ana-
lytical procedures may be different. The sustained release
of DOX from crosslinked PCP micelles is longer compared
that of DOX encapsulated within PLGA-PEG micelles32
and is similar to that of an AB-type block copolymers
grafted with amino acids such as PLA-poly(GA-lysine)
micelles.21 However, the release time and quantity of
DOX from PCP micelles were less than those from PCL-
PEG micelles at speciﬁc conditions such as at pH of
5.0.23 Nevertheless, the crosslinking of amine groups of
PCP micelles by genipin supports the advantages of PCP
copolymers and micelles in drug delivery.
4. CONCLUSION
New tri-block PCP copolymers that can self-assemble
were synthesized to form polymeric micelles with 1.0 M
CMC and a mean size of 90 nm. The zeta potentials of
PCP micelles vary from neutral to cationic when pH values
of their suspended medium are changed from 7.4 to 3.0.
The PCP tri-block copolymers include amine groups that
can be crosslinked with genipin. In addition, the advan-
tages of DOX loaded PCP micelles with post-crosslinked
by genipin are both reducing the burst release and increas-
ing the release periods of DOX in different pH dissolution
mediums. Further different chemical modiﬁcations, such
as grafting with RGD peptides are underway to support
applications in drug delivery and cell targeting.

Abstract
A new PCP tri-block copolymer consisting of poly (e-caprolactone)-b-chitooligosaccharide-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PCL-b-COS-b-
PEG, PCP) was synthesized and characterized. The potential for delivering doxorubicin (DOX), a model drug, with or without genipin
crosslinking was evaluated. The PCP copolymers were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR) to conﬁrm the
amine and ester groups of the COS and the PCL of the copolymer, respectively. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) was per-
formed to determine the structure of the PCP copolymer for demonstrating both PCL and PEG blocks grafted onto the COS block.
Moreover, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was applied to determine the number average molecular weight of the tri-block
copolymer (Mn), which was 11,340 Da/mole. The PCP form polymeric micelles at the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of
0.0107 wt% (or 1.0 lM) with the mean diameter 90 nm, as determined by a dynamic light-scattering (DLS) analyzer. Since PCP micelles
contain COS, the zeta potentials of the micelles are changed from a neutral (e.g., 3.2 ± 1.3 mV at pH 7.4) to a cationic state
(13.9 ± 4.4 mV at pH 3.0) when pH values of the suspension medium are varied. This change is a unique property of the micelles. In
addition, drug delivery behavior of the PCP micelles is inﬂuenced by genipin crosslinking COS. The DOX release period of crosslinked
micelles is signiﬁcantly longer than that of the non-crosslinked ones (e.g., 8 days vs. 4 days, respectively) while the burst release of DOX
of crosslinked ones is signiﬁcantly reduced compared with that of non-crosslinked ones. In conclusion, a new tri-block COS-containing
PCP copolymer/polymeric micelle has been synthesized and characterized. Moreover, the unique properties of COS-containing PCP
micelles are demonstrated by varying zeta potentials via changing pH of medium and by inﬂuencing DOX delivering behaviors after
genipin crosslinking.

1. Introduction
Polymeric micelles have attracted interest in recent years
because they mimic the structural and functional aspects of
biological transport systems (Jeong, Kibbey, Birnbaum,
Won, & Gutowska, 2000; Park et al., 2002; Torchilin,
2001, 2002). Notably, micelles are usually self-assembled
by amphiphilic block copolymers in aqueous solution, the
structures of which contain a hydrophobic core and a
hydrophilic shell. These cores are generally spherical

m-PCL in NMP. The determinations of the numerical aver-
agemolecular weight (Mn) and themolecular weight (Mw) of
the tested samples were based on a linear calibration curve of
six molecular weights of polystyrene standards withMn val-
ue of 1260, 3370, 13,900, 30,300, 52,400, and 189,000. The
molecular weight (Mw) of the synthesized m-PCL was
recorded as 2300. In addition, the molecular weight of the
synthesized reaction intermediate and ﬁnal products, such
as the PCL-COS and PCP copolymers, were determined on
the same equipment.

with a 5 mW He–Ne laser (k = 633 nm). The morphology
of the micelles was observed by TEM, by placing a drop
of PCP micelle solution on a 300 mesh copper grid coated
with carbon. Then, 2.0 wt% of phosphotungstic acid was
used to stain the micelles on the copper grid (Ge et al.,
2002). After the micelle samples were air-dried at room
temperature, the morphology of the stained micelles was
observed and imaged by TEM (JEOL 1200EX, JEOL
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
2.11. Zeta potential measurements
Surface charges or zeta potentials of the micelles were
determined using a Brookhaven Zetasizer (ZetaPlus 90,
Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, USA) at 1.0 wt%
of PCP copolymers/micelles in de-ionized water at 25 C.
The pH values of suspended medium varied from 3.0 to
7.4 and were adjusted by using 0.1 N of HCl or NaOH
solutions.
2.12. Preparing and characterizing delivery behaviors of
DOX of PCP micelles
Five milligrams of PCP copolymers was dissolved in
2 ml of PBS buﬀer, and 1 mg of DOX–HCl was dissolved
in 0.5 ml of pure ethanol in the presence of TEA (molar
ratio to DOX, 1.4:1) solution (Ouchi et al., 2002). The sus-
pensions were further ﬁltered through of membrane with a
pore size of 0.22 lm to remove un-dissolved copolymers.
Those solutions were then mixed at 4 C for 5 h to yield
stable DOX-loaded PCP micelles. The hydrochloride salt
of TEA, free DOX, and unwanted polymer aggregates were
removed by dialyzing the micelle suspensions three times
using a membrane with a cut-oﬀ molecular weight of
6–8 kDa/mole (Spectrum Medical Industries Inc., USA)
in 30 ml of PBS solution at 4 C. The concentration of
DOX in the dialysate obtained from the collections in the
aforementioned puriﬁcation process was further analyzed
to calculate the quantity of DOX encapsulated in PCP
micelles (Wong, Bendayan, Rauth, & Wu, 2004). The con-
centration of DOX in the medium was determined by mea-
suring the absorbent intensity of the medium at 487 nm
using a UV–Vis spectrometer (Jasco V-530, Jasco Inc.,
Japan) (Shuai, Ai, Nasongkla, Kim, & Gao, 2004). The
encapsulation eﬃciency of DOX in micelles is deﬁned as
the ratio of the weight of DOX in micelles to the initial
DOX-loaded weight, expressed as a percentage. The load-
ing content of the micelles is deﬁned as the percentage of
the weight of DOX in micelles divided by the weight
of micelles.
The micelle suspension was further concentrated to
1.0 ml using a column ﬁltered through a cross-ﬂow syringe
ﬁlter with a cut-oﬀ molecular weight of 10 kDa/mole to
study the release of DOX from the micelles (Column Num-
ber: X11S-200-04 N, Spectrum Medical Industries Inc.,
USA). Then, the concentrated DOX-loaded PCP micelles
were placed in a dialysis membrane (Spectrum Laborato-
ries, USA) with a cut-oﬀ molecular weight of 6–8 kDa,
and the membrane was placed in 10 ml PBS dissolution
medium at 37 C in a shaker bath (Tungtec Instruments
Co., Taiwan) at 70 rpm. At the selected time, the dissolu-
tion medium was removed for DOX analysis and replaced
with the same volume of fresh medium. The concentration
of DOX in the medium was determined by measuring the
absorbance intensity of the medium at 487 nm with a
UV–Vis spectrometer (Jasco V-530, Jasco Inc., Japan).
2.13. Post-crosslinking the DOX-loaded PCP micelles by
genipin
Genipin, a natural crosslinking agent, has been widely
applied to the crosslinking of the amine groups of proteins
or chitosan (Mi, Sung, Shyu, Su, & Peng, 2003; Mi, Tan,
Liang, & Sung, 2002). The mild conditions for the cross-
linking of micelles by genipin were applied as described
elsewhere with some modiﬁcations. 0.7 ml of 1.0 wt% gen-
ipin solution (Mi et al., 2003, 2002) was added to 7 ml of a
suspension of DOX-loaded PCP micelles at 37 C to cross-
link the amine groups of PCP micelles. After the crosslink-
ing reactions, the suspensions were dialyzed using a column
ﬁlter (Column #: X11S-200-04N, Spectrum Medical Indus-
tries Inc., USA) to concentrate them and remove residual
genipin. The analysis protocols for determining encapsula-
tion eﬃciency, loading percentage, and the release study of
DOX for post-crosslinked PCP micelles were the same as
those for non-crosslinked PCP micelles.
The statistical analysis was performed using Sigmastat
statistical software (Jandel Science Corp., San Rafael,
CA, USA). Statistical signiﬁcance corresponded to a conﬁ-
dence level of 95% or better. Data measured at least thrice
are presented as mean ± SD.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterizing PCP copolymers
Fig. 1 shows the FT-IR transmittance spectra of COS,
COS-PCL, and PCP copolymers. The transmittance spec-
tra of COS show the characteristic peaks of amide (I) at
1640 cm1 and the amide (II) band at 1560 cm1 (Sugimot-
o et al., 1998). Moreover, the spectra for COS-PCL (Fig. 1)
show a strong absorption band at 2850–3000 cm1which is
due to the C–H stretching band of PCL (e.g., 2945 cm1).
They also show a new absorption band at 1700 cm1
attributable to the ester groups of PCL. The amide (I)
and (II) bands, on the other hand, have shifted slightly.
The spectra and the peaks grafted onto the hydroxyl
groups of chitosan were consistent with observations of
other reporters of PCL (Liu, Li, Liu, & Fang, 2004). The
spectra of PCP copolymer exhibit characteristic peaks like
those of the ester and amide groups of PCL, PEG, and
COS. These are the peaks of the ester groups of PCL at
1720 cm1 as presented in (b), a C–H stretching band at

the structure of PCP copolymers contains two PCL and
PEG polymers.
3.2. PCP micelles and CMC value
Since the structure of the PCP copolymers comprises
hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments, the possibility of
forming PCP micelles as reservoirs for drug delivery is of
interest. The ﬂuorescent hydrophobic dye, DPH, a strong
chromophore showing UV–Vis absorption spectra between
350 nm and 415 nm, was loaded and applied to evaluate
the CMC value of PCP copolymers (Chang, Prange,
Allcock, Lee, & Kim, 2002; Jeong et al., 2000; Savic
et al., 2003). Notably, the absorbance of DPH in a hydro-
phobic environment greatly exceeds that under aqueous
conditions, suggesting that DPH is entrapped into the
PCL core of PCP micelles. Fig. 3 shows that the CMC val-
ue of the PCP micelles was 1.07 · 102 wt% PCP copoly-
mers, as determined by extrapolating the diﬀerence
between the absorbance of the suspension at 384 and
401 nm, which was plotted against the logarithmic of the
concentration of the PCP copolymers. Moreover, the
CMC value of the PCP micelles is of about one order of
magnitude higher than values for PLGA-PEG and PCL-
PEG-based micelles, as reported by other groups (Chang
et al., 2002; Jeong et al., 2000; Savic et al., 2003). That
may be due to the ring structure of the COS of PCP copoly-
mers instead of to linear-chain copolymers.
The size and the morphology of the micelles were deter-
mined and examined using a DLS analyzer and TEM,
respectively, to further characterize the PCP micelles
(Fig. 4). The mean diameter of the PCP micelles measured

corresponding values obtained in the above-mentioned
studies. For instance, DOX loading capacity in crosslinked
PCP micelles is 11.3 wt% while that for PCL-PEG ones
is 3.10 wt% (Nasongkla et al., 2004) although particle
size of the latter is smaller than that of the former.
However, the eﬃciency and loading capacity of PCP
micelles of this study are somewhat lower than what has
been reported for DOX-PLGA-PEG copolymers (Yoo &
Park, 2004).
Fig. 5 presents the release behaviors of DOX-laden PCP
micelles with or without genipin crosslinking (Fig. 5). The
burst release and release periods of DOX for crosslinked
micelles are 22.0 ± 2.3% (at 24 h) and 192 h (with a cumu-
lative releases of 69.4 ± 3.9%, n = 3), respectively, signiﬁ-
cantly reduced from 37.6 ± 3.3% (at 24 h) and longer
than 96 h (with a cumulative releases of 73.4 ± 3.6%,
n = 3), respectively, for non-crosslinked ones. The reducing

Abstract
10 RGD-PCP copolymers were fabricated by grafting Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide to poly("-caprolactone)-b-
chitooligosaccharide-b–poly(ethylene glycol) (PCP) copolymers and the rate of internalization of RGD-PCP
micelles by PC 12 cells were examined. Increasing intensity of the absorbance of amine groups in FT-IR
spectra of RGD-PCP copolymers compared with those of PCP copolymers indicated the presence of RGD
in new copolymers. Moreover, the grafting efficiency and molar ratio of RGD peptides to PCP copolymers
15 were 88.2% and 0.45, respectively, analysed with HPLC. The RGD-PCP copolymers self-assemble to
micelles at the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 0.018wt% (178mg L1) and with a mean diameter
of 90 nm using a dynamic light-scattering (DLS) analyser. Interestingly, the internalization of DPH-loaded
RGD-PCP micelles into PC 12 cells is much faster (e.g. within 5min) than that of PCP micelles. The new
RGD-PCP micelles may potentially be used in cellular drug delivery.

Introduction
Polymeric micelles have attracted interest in recent years
because they mimic the structural and functional aspects
25 of biological transport systems (Jeong et al. 2000; Torchilin
2001, 2002; Park et al. 2002). Notably, micelles are usually
self-assembled by amphiphilic block copolymers in aque-
ous solution whose structures contain a hydrophobic core
and a hydrophilic shell. The hydrophobic cores are gener-
30 ally spherical and nano-sized (10–100 nm) and can be
used as nano-containers for the efficient loading of hydro-
phobic drugs or agents (Torchilin 2001, 2002; Lavasanifar
et al. 2002). Thus, enhancing the ability of micelles in cell
targeting or cellular uptake is of interest in drug delivery of
35 micelle systems.
Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly ("-capro-
lactone) (PCL) were widely chosen as the hydrophobic
segments of micelles. Poly(ethylene-glycol) (PEG) poly-
mers are usually adopted as the hydrophilic segments of
40micelles (Jeong et al. 2000; Lavasanifar et al. 2002; Park
et al. 2002) to provide a brush-like stability corona to
increase the circulatory half-time of micelles in the
blood stream (Yokoyama et al. 1998; Savic et al. 2003).
For instance, PEO-b-PDLLA, PLGA-PEG and PEG-PCL
45copolymers and micelles have been reported (Yokoyama
et al. 1998; Torchilin 2001; Lavasanifar et al. 2002; Park
et al. 2002; Savic et al. 2003). However, the copolymer
chains of such polyester–PEG-based micelles have no
functional groups, such as amine groups, to be chemically
50modified, nor can the surface characteristics of the
micelles be changed. Recently, conjugating the hydropho-
bic block with few carboxylic acids to increase the loaded
efficiency of drug into micelles by enhancing the interac-
tion between the core and the hydrophobic drug was
55reported (Lee et al. 2004). Alternatively, amine-groups
containing PCP copolymers/micelles have been synthe-
sized and their zeta potentials change when pH of their
suspended media is varied (Liu et al. 2007).

160 Grafting RGD into PCP copolymers
To prepare a RGD-PCP copolymer, RGD was photochem-
ically grafted into a PCP copolymer. A fixed concentration
of GRGD-SANPAH solution was photochemically reacted
with PCP copolymers to prepare RGD-PCP copolymers as
165 in an earlier study in this laboratory (Chung et al. 2002)
with modifications. In brief, 0.025 M of GRGD and
SANPAH were first dissolved in distilled water and pure
ethanol, respectively, and equivalent moles of two solu-
tions were reacted in a dark room at 25C for 2 h to syn-
170 thesize GRGD-SANPAH in solution. Both reactants were
assumed completely reacted; 0.260 ml of ethanol contain-
ing GRGD-SANPAH solution was mixed with 50 mg PCP
copolymers and then irradiated by ultraviolet light
(290–370 nm) powered by a UV generator (Model 68805,
175 ORIEL Instrument, Stratford, CT) for 5 min to induce a
photochemical reaction to graft RGD to PCP copolymers,
RGD-PCP copolymers. The RGD-PCP copolymers were
placed in a dialysis bag with cut-off molecular weight at
6 8 kDa which was submerged in 20 ml distilled
180 water for 4 h at 25C and shaken at 70 rpm to remove
the un-reacted GRGD-SANPAH. At the end of dialysis,
the distilled water was collected to measure the
concentration of GRGD by a HPLC method for further
determining the mole of GRGD to be grafted into PCP
185 copolymers.
Determining molar ratio of RGD grafting to PCP
copolymers by HPLC
The aforementioned collected GRGD-SANPAH contain-
ing distilled water was further analysed by a HPLC ana-
190 lyser to semi-quantitative the grafted ratio of GRGD to
PCP copolymers (Jasco PU-1580 HPLC Pump; Jasco
UV-1575 UV/VIS Detector, Kobe, Japan) equipped with
a C18 reverse phase column (# 201SP54, 4.6 mm–25 cm
ID, VyDAC Corp, Hesperia, CA) at 25C. For this analy-
195 sis, the mobile phase was 10% acetonitrile dissolved in
0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) solution with
0.8 ml min1 flow rate and the concentration of the col-
lected GRGD-SANPAH containing distilled water was
determined by measuring the area of peak at wavelength
200 254 nm and at retention time of 3.50 min of the HPLC by
a built-in software (Chung et al. 2002). The mole of
GRGD grafted into PCP copolymers is the value: the ini-
tial mole of GRGD-SANPAH for the photochemical reac-
tions with 50 mg PCP copolymers deducts the mole of
205 GRGD in distilled water. The molar ratio of GRGD to
PCP copolymers (Mw 12 508 Da mole1) was then
determined.
Characterizing RGD-PCP copolymer by
FT-IR spectroscopy
210FT-IR absorption spectra of synthesized RGD-PCP, PCP
copolymers and COS were analysed using a FT-IR analyser
(Digilab. FTS-3000MX, Digilab Corp., MA) collected at
2 cm1 of resolution to characterize the functional
groups including amine and ester groups of the copoly-
215mers, as an early report by this lab (Liu et al. 2007).
Preparing RGD-PCP micelles and determining CMC
Micelles of RGD-PCP were prepared by direct dissolution
method (Ge et al. 2002). In general, 1 mg of RGD-PCP
copolymers were dispersed in distilled water at 40C for
2201 h to induce micelle formations. They were then filtered
through a membrane with pore size 0.22 mm. The filtrated
micelle suspension was further equilibrated for 5 h at
room temperature. The CMC value of RGD-PCP copoly-
mers was determined by a DPH, a hydrophobic fluores-
225cent probe, fluorescent method, as reported by many
investigators (Jeong et al. 2000; Park et al. 2002; Liu et al.
2007; Lu et al. 2007). Briefly, 20 ml of 0.4 mM DPH dissolved
in methanol was injected into 2.0 ml of RGD-PCP copoly-
mer suspensions with concentrations from 2 103 to
2301.0 wt.% and then equilibrated for 5 h in the dark to form
DPH-loaded RGD-PCP micelles. Un-encapsulated DPH
was removed with a dialysis column (Spectrum laboratory
Inc. CA) with a cut-off molecular weight of 6–8 KDa within
30 min at 4C. The absorbance spectra of RGD-PCP
235micelle suspensions were measured using a UV-VIS spec-
trometer (Jasco V-530, Jasco Inc., Japan) in the range of
350 430 nm at 25C. The CMC value of the micelles was
determined by plotting the difference between the absor-
bance at 386 nm and that at 401 nm against the logarith-
240mic concentration of the RGD-PCP as reported by other
groups (Jeong et al. 2000; Park et al. 2002).
The size of the PCP and RGD-PCP micelles in aqueous
solution was determined using a DLS analyser (Malvern
ZetaSizer 1000 HSA, Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire,
245UK) with a 5 mW He-Ne laser (¼ 633 nm) at 25C. The
morphology of RGD-PCP micelles was observed by TEM
as with that of PCP micelles (Liu et al. 2007).
Studying cellular internalization of the micelles into
PC-12 cells and the intensity of micelles within the cells
250A PC-12 (rat pheochromocytoma) cell line was obtained
from ATCC CRL-1722 (American Type Culture Collection,
Manassas, VA) and cultured in Ham’s F12K and
2 mM L-glutamine medium supplemented with 15%
horse serum and 2.5% serum foetal bovine serum (FBS).

than that of PCP micelles (e.g. 107 mg L1) that may be due
to the steric hindrance effect of SANPAH molecules of
340 micelles with grafting of RGD. The size and the morphol-
ogy of the micelles were determined and examined by
using a DLS particle analyser and by TEM, respectively,
to further characterize the RGD-PCP micelles. The mean
diameter of the RGD-PCP micelles measured using the
345 analyser was 90 nm and the polydispersity index (PDI)
was 1.35 (data not shown), which is similar to that of
PCP micelles (Liu et al. 2007). Furthermore, the TEM
morphologies of the micelles show the spherical particles
which the size range of 50–120 nm (Figure 3) that are about
350 the same as PCP micelles (Liu et al. 2007). Accordingly, the
CMC value and the dimensions of the particle size of RGD-
PCP micelles closely are well fitted to the requirements of
nano-containers as a candidate for drug delivery
(Torchilin 2001, 2002).
355Cellular internalization of PCP and RGD-PCPmicelles
into the PC-12 cells
Figure 4(a) shows the images of PC-12 cells without any
fluorescence in the medium in bright field at the time of
starting the experiments. The images of fluorescent PC-12
360cells of internalization of RGD-PCP micelles at 9 and
21 min (Figure 4(b) and (c)) are shown, while those of
the cells of internalization of PCP micelles are too dim to
be visualized and digitalized until 30 min (Figure 4(d)).
Hence, the internalization of RGD-PCP micelles by the
365cells is much faster and more effective than PCP micelles
(e.g. 4(b)). Moreover, the fluorescent intensities of the
imaged cells that internalize RGD-PCP micelles are digi-
talized for 30 min (Figure 4(e)). The results of Figure 4(e)
indicate that the cellular internalization of RGD-PCP
370micelles by PC-12 cells is very fast and reaches a plateau
at 18 min and maintains at a similar range during the
observation period. Low cellular internalization of PCP
micelles into PC-12 cells is similar to the reports of inter-
nalization of PCL-PEG micelles into the same type of cells
375(Allen et al. 1999) or by neural cells (Maysinger et al. 2001).
Since the fluorescent absorbance of DPH could only be
measured when DPH was trapped or loaded into

differences of absorbance between 384–401 nm of DPH absorption spec-

PCP copolymers grafted with RGD 5

to PEG segments of PCL-PEG micelles that hinder them to
395 approach the cells and thereby decrease the cellular inter-
nalization (Allen et al. 1999; Fontana et al. 2001; Maysinger
et al. 2001). The same phenomena may be applied in the
cellular internalization of PCP micelles for this study. The
rapid cellular internalization of RGD-PCP micelles is sim-
400 ilar to the report of other investigators (Chenevier et al.
2002) but they used RGD-functionalized lipid vesicles. Of
interest, qualitatively, the cellular internalization rate of
RGD-PCP micelles of this study is much faster (e.g.
18 min) than that of RGD-functionalized lipid vesicles
405 (e.g. 1 h) (Maysinger et al. 2001). Mediating by high
molar ratio of RGD in RGD-PCP copolymers may be attrib-
utable to fast cellular internalization of PC-12 cells.
However, two studies used different fluorescent carriers
and culturing cells. The fast cellular internalization of
410 RGD-PCP micelles may be mediated by v3 integrin
receptors of plasmatic membrane of PC-12 cells.
Nevertheless, PCP micelles with RGD grafting do qualita-
tively increase the rates themselves to be internalized into
the cells compared to that of PCP micelles.
415 Conclusion
RGD grafted into PCP copolymer is verified by FT-IR spec-
tra with a molar ratio of RGD-to-PCP copolymer of 0.45.
The RGD-PCP copolymers self-assemble as polymeric
micelles at a CMC value of 178 mg L1 and with a mean
420 micelle size of 90 nm. The faster rate of RGD-PCP micelles
into the PC-12 cells than those of PCP micelles may be
mediated by RGD of the micelles. According to this
study, the RGD-PCP micelles have high potentials in
drug delivery.
