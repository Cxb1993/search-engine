Melt Preparation 
Cast iron melts were prepared in a 50 kW, high-frequency (3000Hz) induction furnace using 
charges composed of low sulfur pig iron, steel scrap and Fe-Si alloy (for Si content adjustment). 
Both the spheroidization and compactization treatments were carried out at about 1500oC (2732oF) 
by adding an Mg-FeSi alloy and an Mg-RE-FeSi alloy, respectively, using the sandwich method. 
Inoculation was performed by stirring the inoculant into the melt stream while the melt was 
transferred into a ladle for spheroidization or compactization. The inoculant employed is a 
proprietary Fe-Si alloy that contains Ba, Ca and Al.  
 
Thermal Fatigue Test 
The experiment apparatus, both schematic and the actual set-up, for evaluating the thermal fatigue 
life is illustrated in Fig. 2. The thermal fatigue test specimen was mounted at both ends on a fixture 
by a fixed clamping force of 5 ft-lb. An induction coil placed over the test specimen was used for 
heating. The thermal fatigue specimens have a section thickness of 2-mm, and have a V-notch 
(0.25mm) in the middle, as shown in Fig. 3. During the cyclic thermal fatigue testing, firstly, power 
was turned on and the specimen was heated to the pre-determined temperature, 800oC (1472oF), in 
60 seconds, and then the power was turn off and the test specimen was immediately quenched to 
room temperature by spraying water directly onto the test specimen. The cooled test specimen was 
dried by compressed air, and then the test specimen was ready for the next thermal cycle. The 
procedures continued until the test specimen failed completely. 
3-mm and 6-mm sections are around 10%, 20% and 70%, respectively. Fig. 6 illustrates 
the typical microstructures of different sections.

In order to realize how the thermal fatigue property is affected by the graphite structure, 
6-mm section plates were cast for evaluation due to the fact that a meaningful 
representation of compacted graphite structure can be obtained in this section. Then, 
2-mm section specimens were prepared from the 6-mm section castings for the 
constrained thermal fatigue tests.  
Thermal Fatigue Property 
Comparisons in thermal fatigue life (the total thermal cycles to failure) tested in 2-mm section 
specimens (machined from as-cast 6-mm section plates) among irons with different graphite 
morphology are shown in Fig. 7. The thermal fatigue cycles to fracture is highest for irons with SG, 
which is followed by irons with CG, and then irons with FG. In one CG iron heat, where some 
0.5%Mo was added, the thermal fatigue life is substantially increased, even better than that of SG 
irons.

An increase in thickness near the thermal center of the thermal fatigue test specimens is related to 
the stress relaxation at elevated temperature. Generally, a more resistance to stress relaxation of an 
alloy would result in less increase in thickness. Therefore, alloys with a higher Si content and/or 
with Mo addition possess better resistance to stress relaxation. This can explain the improved 
thermal fatigue property in alloys with an increased Si content and/or where Mo was added. In 
addition, the effect of graphite morphology on the extent of swelling as a function of thermal 
fatigue cycle is shown in Fig. 8 for 2-mm section test specimens machined from the original 6-mm 
section plate castings. As indicated in Fig. 8, the extent of swelling at the thermal center of the test

Conclusions 
This study investigated the effect of graphite morphology on the thermal fatigue property of 
thin-section (2mm ~ 6mm) graphitic cast irons. Based upon the results obtained, the following 
conclusions can be drawn: 
(1) To produce carbide-free spheroidal graphite irons in relatively thin sections of 2-mm or 3-mm in 
the as cast conditions is feasible. However, for compacted graphite cast irons, graphite particles 
largely in nodular form always occurs in rather thin sections, and acceptable compacted graphite 
structure can only be obtained when the section thickness exceeds about 6-mm. 
(2) The extent of swelling at the thermal center of the test specimens is highest for irons with 
spheroidal graphite, followed by irons with compacted graphite, and then CG irons with Mo 
addition, and the irons with flake graphite is the least.  
(3) Regarding the constrained cyclic thermal fatigue property (RT ~ 800oC), cast irons with 
spheroidal graphite exhibit the best thermal fatigue life, which is followed by irons with 
compacted graphite, and then flake graphite cast irons. 
(4) Adding some 0.5%Mo to the irons significantly improves the thermal fatigue property, in some 
cases even by a factor of 2, implying that the role of Mo outweighs the influence of graphite 
structure in promoting thermal fatigue property.
