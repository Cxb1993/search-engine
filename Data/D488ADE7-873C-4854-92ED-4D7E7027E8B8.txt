本研究在圓柱座標系下，針對橫觀等向性材料結構之軸對稱問題，建立了 Hamiltonian
數學解析模式。不同於以往在狀態方程的推衍方式，本研究由軸對稱彈性力學基本方程
式出發，運用 Hamiltonian 變分方程及 Legendre 轉換，有系統地推導出以位移分量和其
對應之應力分量為共軛變量所表示之狀態方程式與輸出方程式，確保了此解析架構所具
備之 Hamiltonian 數學基本特性。研究中發現，針對一般有限長度之軸對稱圓柱結構之
線性系統，均可將之分解為兩個基本物理問題(fundamental problems)，再進行各別解析。
其中 Hamiltonian 系統下之特徵值問題在解析過程中扮演著重要角色，該系統的特徵向
量所具備之辛正交(symplectic orthogonality)特性使得特徵函數展開法得以充分運用，並
能有系統地處理該問題所對應之任意邊界條件。文中以有限長度之中空圓柱結構於兩端
固定且內外表面承受均勻壓力為例，解析求得其確解，並與平面應變(plane strain)假設下
之古典解作比較，探討了端點效應。

Abstract
Torsion of elastic circular bars of radially inhomogeneous, cylindrically orthotropic materials is studied with emphasis
on the end eﬀects. To examine the conjecture of Saint-Venant’s torsion, we consider torsion of circular bars with one end
ﬁxed and the other end free on which tractions that results in a pure torque are prescribed arbitrarily over the free end
surface. Exact solutions that satisfy the prescribed boundary conditions point by point over the entire boundary surfaces
are derived in a uniﬁed manner for cylindrically orthotropic bars with or without radial inhomogeneity and for their coun-
terparts of Saint-Venant’s torsion. Stress diﬀusion due to the end eﬀect is examined in the light of the exact solutions.

1. Introduction
Saint-Venant’s torsion of a homogeneous, isotropic elastic circular bar is a classical problem of elasticity
(Sokolnikoﬀ, 1956), which was solved using the semi-inverse method by assuming a state of pure shear in
the body such that it gives rise to a resultant torque over the end section. Extension to more complicated
cases of anisotropic or non-homogeneous materials or both has been considered by Lekhnitskii (1981), Roo-
ney and Ferrari (1995), Horgan and Chan (1999), Ting (1999), Tarn (2001, 2002a), Tarn and Wang (2001),
Tarn and Chang (2005) and Chen and Wei (2005), among others. In particular, Dong and his coworkers
(Dong et al., 2001; Huang and Dong, 2001; Kosmatka et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2001) used a semi-analytic
ﬁnite element method to investigate the Saint-Venant problem of inhomogeneous, generally anisotropic cyl-
inders with non-circular sections. A common feature of Saint-Venant’s solutions for this class of problems is
that the exact boundary conditions (BC) prescribed on the end surfaces are relaxed by considering the stress
resultants over the end section. As such, for the solutions to be exact the end conditions cannot be arbi-
trarily prescribed – it must be speciﬁed in the same way as demanded by the theory – otherwise the stress

On the basis of the state space formalism of anisotropic elasticity in the cylindrical coordinate system (Tarn,

Solution of the state equations, Eqs. (6) and (8), must be supplemented with BC. For torsion problems of
circular bars with one end ﬁxed and the other free on which the traction that results in a pure torque is pre-

where c00, c1 and c2 are undetermined constants.
To avoid displacement and stress being unbounded at r = 0, we must set c2 = 0. Further, the constant
c0 = 0 so as to satisfy the ﬁxed end BC at z = 0. There follows

where c1 is a constant to be determined. The equation satisﬁes the BC on the cylindrical surface r = b
identically.
Upon substituting Eq. (24) in Eq. (18) to determine c1, we obtain

The result agrees with that in Lekhnitskii (1981) using the stress function approach. It is interesting to note
that Eq. (25) satisﬁes the ﬁxed end BC at z = 0 identically without handling it in particular. Hence the solution
holds for a cantilever bar provided that the exact traction BC at the free end is replaced by the condition
requiring the stress resultant equal to Mt.
3.2. Radially inhomogeneous bars
Consider Saint-Venant’s torsion of a FGM circular bar with material properties varying in the radial direc-
tion such that the elastic constants cij = cij(r) are arbitrary, diﬀerentiable functions of r. We seek the solution to
Eq. (8) by separation of variables.

include the solution associated with k5 0, in addition to Eqs. (22) and (23) for k = 0.

where a is a constant which may be zero, real or imaginary.
For a5 0, Eq. (63) with arbitrary c44(r) and c66(r) is unsolvable in a closed form. The only class of radial
inhomogeneity that allows an exact solution of Eq. (63) seems to be that having variation deﬁned by
cijðrÞ ¼ aijðr=bÞ2l; ð64Þ
where the coeﬃcient aij have the same dimension as cij, l is a non-negative real number. The homogeneous
material is a special case with l = 0.
Such a radial inhomogeneity, known as the power-law radial inhomogeneity, was usually assumed in stress
analysis of FGM in cylindrical coordinates (Lekhnitskii, 1981; Horgan and Chan, 1999; Yang, 2000; Tarn,
2001; among others). Although it is possible to obtain an approximate solution for arbitrary radial inhomo-
geneity by using piecewise-constant representation of the material properties in conjunction with the method
of transfer matrix (Tarn and Chang, 2005), in keeping with the main theme of the present study, we conﬁne
ourselves to determining the exact solution for a cantilever circular bar with the power-law radial
inhomogeneity.

which indicates that the displacement and the transverse shear stress vanish at the ﬁxed end as in Saint-Ve-
nant’s torsion, but the longitudinal shear stress rhz is aﬀected by the load distribution at the free end, the mate-
rial anisotropy and the radial inhomogeneity, in addition to the eigenvalues kn.
Suppose that the traction on the free end surface is prescribed as p(r) = kr2l+1, in accordance with the radial
distribution of rhz given by Eq. (34) for Saint-Venant’s torsion, there follows from Eq. (12), Eqs. (83), (84),
and (76):

so that the series terms in Eqs. (85)–(87) vanish and the solutions are precisely the same as their Saint-Venant
counterparts given by Eq. (34).
The results show that the Saint-Venant solution is exact provided that the traction over the end surface is
prescribed in a particular manner as assumed above. In practice, one can hardly apply p(r) in the same manner
as demanded. Consequently, stress disturbance due to the end eﬀect occurs. In the next section we shall eval-
uate the end eﬀect quantitatively by comparing Eq. (34) for Saint-Venant’s torsion against the exact solution
given by Eqs. (85)–(87).
5. Results and discussion
It has been shown that the leading terms in the exact solution are identical to the Saint-Venant solution and
the end eﬀects are described solely by the series terms of Eqs. (56)–(58). Obviously, the BC at both ends of a
ﬁnite circular bar play important roles in the stress distribution and they are indistinguishable in general. Yet,
for a suﬃciently long bar it can be deduced from Eqs. (48)–(50) and (77)–(79) that the stress diﬀusion from the
end is essentially dictated by the terms associated with exp(jknz) since the terms of exp(jknz) which produce
unbounded stresses as z!1 should be dropped from Eqs. (48)–(50) and (77)–(79) before imposing the end
conditions. With this in mind, it is appropriate to deﬁne the characteristic decay length
L ¼ ln 100
jkn
; ð90Þ
as a simple measure to estimate the stress disturbance from the end in a long circular bar, which is the distance
measured from the end beyond which the series terms contribute only 1% in magnitude to the deformation and
stresses. In other words, the deformation and stresses in the region beyond L from the end are essentially inde-
pendent of the load distribution over the end surface so that the Saint-Venant solution should be applicable.
Of course, other percentage could be chosen for the estimation and the smallest eigenvalue k1 should be used
to determine the largest L.
Knowing k1b = 5.1356 for a homogeneous bar, so

which suggests that the end eﬀect is far-reaching for strong anisotropy (c44 c66). Since c44 = c66 for isotropic
materials, L = 0.8967b, suggesting that the stress disturbance is indeed conﬁned to a local region near the end
in a long homogeneous isotropic bar. Tables 1 and 2 show the smallest eigenvalue k1 associated with the
parameter of the radial inhomogeneity l, and the characteristic decay length L of long circular bars in con-
nection with l and the material parameter j ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃc66=c44p . To show the eﬀect of anisotropy, we take c44/
c66 = 1,4,16,100 for computation. All cases are admissible in that they satisfy the requirement of positive-def-

equation do not exhibit permutable structure so that choice of the state vector must be done judiciously.
Herein, the formalism is reﬁned by introducing the generalized displacement vector and the generalized stress
vectors as the fundamental variables in which appropriate electrical variables are included, with in view that
the boundary conditions of the problems are directly associated with them. Carrying out the idea, the basic
equations of piezoelectricity with temperature change, including the constitutive equations for piezothermo-
elastic materials of the most general class, the strain–displacement relations, the equations of equilibrium,
the equations of electrostatics, and the electric ﬁeld–electric potential relations, are formulated into the state
space framework in which two matrix equations in terms of the generalized displacement vector and general-
ized stress vectors embrace the 3D equations of piezothermoelasticity in full. The expressions are simple, expli-
cit, and much clearer than the previous one. More importantly, the state equation and the output equation
bear a remarkable resemblance to their elastic counterparts, diﬀering only in the dimensions and entities of
the corresponding matrices. As such, correspondence between piezothermoelasticiy and anisotropic elasticity
emerges in the state space setting, which enables us to determine the solutions for various problems of piezo-
thermoelasticity by extension of the corresponding elastic solutions. In many cases, piezothermoelastic solu-
tions can be obtained simply by replacing the elastic matrices with their piezoelectric counterparts.
For illustration, a number of fundamental problems of piezothermoelasticity are studied within the context,
including inﬁnite-space and half-space Green’s function solutions for piezoelectric media subjected to line
sources, the electromechanical ﬁelds in a piezoelectric half-space subjected to line loads, and electroelastic
analysis of an inﬁnite piezoelectric plate with an elliptic notch subjected to uniform extension. Exact solutions
for the problems, each in their own right, are derived in a systematic and self-contained manner.
2. State space formulation
Consider the piezoelectric material of the most general kind. The linear piezothermoelastic constitutive
equations in tensor notation (Nye, 1957) are
rij ¼ cijklekl  ekijEk  bijT ; ð1Þ
Di ¼ eijkejk þ jikEk þ pei T ; ð2Þ
where rij and eij are the stress and strain tensors, Di and Ei are the electric displacement and electric ﬁeld vec-
tors, T is the temperature ﬁeld, cijkl the 21 elastic constants measured at a constant electric ﬁeld and constant
temperature, jij the permittivity constants measured at constant strain and constant temperature, eijk the pie-
zoelectric constants measured at constant temperature, bij the thermal coeﬃcients measured at constant elec-
tric ﬁeld, pei the pyroelectric constants measured at constant strain. The material constants possess the
symmetric properties
cijkl ¼ cjikl ¼ cijlk ¼ cklij; ekij ¼ ekji; jik ¼ jki; bij ¼ bji: ð3Þ
Eqs. (1) and (2) are the constitutive relations for piezoelectric materials of the 32 crystal classes and piezo-
electric ceramics. There are 54 independent material constants in total for a piezoelectric material of the most
general kind. In particular, Eq. (1) reduces to the constitutive equations of anisotropic thermoelastic materials
by letting eijk ¼ 0:
The linear strain–displacement relations are
eij ¼ ðojui þ oiujÞ=2; ð4Þ
where oi stands for the partial derivatives with respect to spacial coordinates xi; ui denotes the components of
displacement components.
The equations of stress equilibrium are
ojrji þ F i ¼ 0; ð5Þ
where F i denotes the body force components.
The charge equation of electrostatics is
oiDi ¼ fq; ð6Þ
3022 J.-Q. Tarn, H.-H. Chang / International Journal of Solids and Structures 45 (2008) 3021–3032
Eqs. (12) and (13) bear a remarkable resemblance to their elastic counterparts except for the dimensions
and entities of the corresponding matrices. As such, the state equation and the output equation for piezother-
moelasticity can be written out at once as follows:

Eqs. (14) and (15) embrace the 3D equations of piezothermoelasticity in full, hold for non-homogeneous
media as well. They exhibit permutable structure of the indices 1, 2, and 3 so that, if r1 or r2 is to be chosen
in place of r3, the corresponding state equation and output equation can be written out by index permutation.
Note that these equations are identical to the state equation and the output equation for anisotropic elasticity,
diﬀering only in dimensions of the corresponding matrices.
3. Generalized plane problems
In the present work we conﬁne our attention to applications of the formalism to the generalized plane prob-
lems. It can be shown, through analysis of the eigensolution in the case of zero eigenvalue, that the generalized
displacement ﬁeld for the generalized plane problems of piezothermoelasticity takes the form

4.2. Half-space Green’s functions
When the line source is acting in the half-space deﬁned by x2 6 0, the electromechanical ﬁeld in the inﬁnite-
space is perturbed by the presence of the half-space boundary. With this in view, let
F kðzkÞ ¼ ck logðzk  zkÞ þ /kðzkÞ; zk ¼ x1 þ pkx2; ð33Þ
where ck logðzk  zkÞ are the complex functions for the inﬁnite-space, which produce a generalized displace-
ment increment equal to b and resultant traction and electric charge equal to p. The unknown complex func-
tions /kðzkÞ must be analytic in x2 6 0 so that the additional terms do not produce resultants over a simply
closed contour enclosing zk .
The unknown /kðzkÞ are to be determined from the prescribed BC on the half-space. To be speciﬁc, we con-
sider in the following two types of BC.
1. Traction-free and insulated BC:
r2 ¼ 0 on x2 ¼ 0: ð34Þ
3026 J.-Q. Tarn, H.-H. Chang / International Journal of Solids and Structures 45 (2008) 3021–3032
where T ðx1Þ and Nðx1Þ are prescribed normal force and shearing force.
The electrical BC is
D2 ¼ Dðx1Þ or / ¼ uðx1Þ on x2 ¼ 0; ð46Þ
where Dðx1Þ and uðx1Þ are prescribed electric charge and voltage, respectively.
First, consider the case when the electric charge is prescribed in addition to the mechanical loads. In the
present context, the BC is simply
r2ðx1; 0Þ ¼ gðx1Þ; ð47Þ
where
gðx1Þ ¼ ½ T ðx1Þ Nðx1Þ 0 Dðx1Þ T:
Substituting Eq. (24)2 with e ¼ # ¼ b1 ¼ b2 ¼ 0 into Eq. (47) gives

obtain a system of four algebraic equations

obtained by integration with respect to z and replacing the variable z by zk.
Next, consider the case when the electric voltage is prescribed in addition to the mechanical loads. The BC
can be expressed as
K1r2ðx1; 0Þ ¼ h1ðx1Þ; K2uðx1; 0Þ ¼ h2ðx1Þ; ð51Þ

In order to determine fkðzkÞ from Eq. (61) for the auxiliary ﬁeld, the notch boundary in terms of zk
ðk ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4Þ must be expressed in terms of the same variable, say n. This amounts to mapping the exterior
of the notch in the zk planes onto the exterior of a unit circle in the n plane. It has been shown (Wang and
Tarn, 1993) that such a mapping is possible only if the notch is of elliptic shape and the mapping function is
zk ¼ mknþ mkn1; n ¼ eih; ðk ¼ 1; 2; 3; 4Þ ð62Þ

formulation for axisymmetric deformations of transversely
isotropic and isotropic materials. Symplectic orthogonality rela-
tions of the eigenvectors are derived in particular. By means of
eigenfunction expansion, an exact analysis of the displacement
and stress ﬁelds in the cylinder under its own weight, with the bot-
tom plane perfectly bonded or in smooth contact with the rigid
base, is carried out. The end effect is evaluated with reference to
the simpliﬁed solution.
2. State space formulation
Consider a ﬁnite circular cylinder of uniform cross-section rest-
ing on a rigid base under its own weight. Let the origin of the cylin-
drical coordinates (r, h, z) be located at the center of the bottom
plane, with the z axis pointing upward. When the force of gravity
is the only external force acting on the circular cylinder with
appropriate BC on the bottom plane, the deformation and stress
ﬁelds are independent of h. The basic equations for the problem
are given below.

where, it is understood that the indices 1, 2, 3 stand for r, h, and z,
respectively, cij are the elastic constants with reference to the cylin-

dent elastic constants for transversely isotropic materials. When
the material is isotropic, c33 = c11,c13 = c12, c44 = c66 = (c11  c12)/2.
On the basis of the state space formalism for anisotropic elastic-

It can be veriﬁed that Eq. (13), which represents a uniaxial stress
state, satisﬁes the equations of elasticity of transversely isotropic
materials, the traction-free BC on the top plane and on the lateral
surface of the cylinder, but not the end conditions at z = 0. In fact,
let c33 = c11, c13 = c12, Eq. (13) reduces to the simpliﬁed solution
for an isotropic circular cylinder under its own weight (Timoshenko
and Goodier, 1970; Sokolnikoff, 1956). To account for the end con-
ditions, the ﬁrst thing to do is to determine a complete solution of
Eq. (4), which consists of the homogeneous solution in addition to
the particular solution.

By inspection, if l is a root of Eq. (31), so is l. Moreover, l = 0 is a
repeated root, which can be veriﬁed by replacing l by l in Eq. (31)
and using the fact that l = 0is a zero of J1(jla) and J0(jjlr)
= J0(jjlr), J1(jjlr) =  J1(jjlr). As will be shown in Section 7, it
is a natural result of a Hamiltonian system.
Substituting the eigenvalues li (i = 1, 2, . . .) determined from Eq.
(31) back to Eq. (30), expressing A2i in terms of A1i, we obtain
A2i ¼  f3ðj1;li; aÞf3ðj2;li; aÞ

The case of l0 = 0 requires special consideration. Since l0 = 0 is a re-

l0 = 0 is obtained from Eqs. (30)–(32):
½ur uz rrrz rrzz ¼ ½0 1 0 0; ½rrrr rrhh ¼ ½0 0; ð33Þ
which is a rigid body translation in z axis.
Another linearly independent eigenvector associated with
l0 = 0 can be determined by considering the Jordan-chain solution
given by Eqs. (66)–(69) as
½ur uz rrrz rrzz ¼ ½b1r z 0 b2r; ½rrrr rrhh ¼ ½0 0; ð34Þ

As a result, the solution of Eq. (4) for isotropic materials takes
the same form as Eqs. (35) and (36), in which c33 = c11, c13 = c12,

Before passing on, a few remarks on the orthogonality and coefﬁ-
cient determination are in order. Unlike a conventional formulation
in which orthogonality of the eigenvectors involves either the dis-
placement vector or the stress vector, symplectic orthogonality in
the Hamiltonian state space holds for the eigenvector derived from
the state vector which is composed of the displacement vector and
the associated stress vector. The eigenvector consists of two vector
components, namely, the vector u and the vector s as deﬁned in Eq.
(53). Without fully grasping the Hamiltonian characteristics of the
system, one is likely to impose the ﬁxed end conditions on the dis-
placement components and attempt to determine the unknown
constants from the resulting scalar equations. A difﬁcult situation
then arises – there are four arbitrary scalar functions to be ex-
panded into series in terms of the given functions with the same
set of unknown constants. Consequently, the number of systems
of equations is larger than the number of unknowns, rendering
the equations inconsistent and unsolvable in general. In few restric-
tive cases where the system of equations is consistent and solvable,
one often has to resort to an approximate method to determine the
unknown constants. It is well known that using an approximate
method to expand an arbitrary function into a series in terms of gi-
ven functions often leads to non-convergent results. There is no
guarantee that the method of least square or Gram-Schmidt orthog-
onalization (Kantorovich and Krylov, 1964; Hildebrand, 1965) will
produce a valid solution. A solution scheme along this line is limited
in its use.
8. Determining the unknown constants
Returning to the task of determining A0, B0, Ai and Ai in Eqs.
(41) and (42). With the symplectic orthogonality given by Eqs.
(65) and (76), it is possible to express an arbitrary integrable state
vector in terms of a sequence of orthogonal eigenvectors in the
state space by means of eigenfunction expansion.
Let us consider the case of the ﬁxed end at z = 0 in detail. Mul-
tiplying both sides of Eq. (41) by wTiJ; w
T
i J; ½wð1Þ0 T J, and ½wð0Þ0 T J,
respectively, and integrating them over (0,a), making use of the
symplectic orthogonality, we obtain
Ai ¼

placements and stresses converge rapidly (taking less than 20
terms) in region away from the ﬁxed end, but relatively slow (tak-
ing up to 40 terms) in region where the end effect is signiﬁcant.
Figs. 3 and 4 depict variations of displacements and stresses in
the radial direction at z = 0.1a and at the ﬁxed end z = 0 by taking
40 terms of the series. The lateral BC rrr = rrz = 0 at r = a are satis-
ﬁed as required. The stresses rrr, rhh and rrz are small but non-zero,
whereas the simpliﬁed solution gives rrr = rhh = rrz = 0. Remark-
able differences in the axial stress rzz from the one given by the
simpliﬁed solution exist around the rim of the cylinder. This is ex-
pected because the ﬁxed end conditions ur = uz = 0 at z = 0 are not
satisﬁed by the simpliﬁed solution. Fig. 4 show that the lateral
BC and end conditions are satisﬁed in the present analysis. The
stresses rzz and rrz overshoot near the boundary points r = a, indi-
cating stress concentration appears at the rim on the base plane at
the ﬁxed end due to geometric discontinuity. The values of rzz and
rrz near r = a reach 1.3qgl and 0.1qgl, respectively, comparing with
rzz = qgl and rrz = 0 according to the simpliﬁed solution. As a con-

without ﬁber reinforcements. Consequently, as the axial stiffness
increases, the end effect on the stress ﬁeld decreases and the stress
state in the cylinder under its own weight tends to be uniaxial.
To show the effect of the sliding contact, Fig. 5 depicts the dis-
placements and stresses in the axial direction around the rim
(r = a) of the cylinder with a sliding-contact end. The deformed
shape of the cylinder can be observed from Figs. 1 and 5 in which
the variations of ur at r = a in the axial direction are depicted. It is
interesting to note that the deformed shape of the ﬁxed-end cylin-
der and that of the cylinder with a sliding-contact end are remark-
ably different in the region where the end effect is signiﬁcant. The
results for the case of the sliding-contact end are close to the sim-
pliﬁed ones except for appreciable differences in ur and rzz near
the bottom plane. This is in accord with the physical situation in
that the sliding-contact allows the base plane free to move radially
so that rrz = rhz = 0 at z = 0, which are satisﬁed identically by the
uniaxial stress ﬁeld. Hence the only end condition which is not
satisﬁed by the simpliﬁed solution is uz = 0 at z = 0. Yet, under
the force of gravity, uz at z = 0 is small, so the condition uz = 0 plays
a minor role as the axial stiffness increases. Variations of the dis-
placements and stresses in the radial direction at the bottom plane
of the cylinder are nearly identical to the simpliﬁed ones. The cal-
culations show that all the stress components are almost zero ex-
cept for rzz varying linearly in z and ur linearly in r. This suggests
that, when the bottom plane of the cylinder is in smooth contact
with a rigid base, the simpliﬁed solution is a good approximation
for the circular cylinder under its own weight.
10. Conclusions
The problem of a circular elastic cylinder under its own weight
is revisited. On the basis of Hamiltonian state space formulation, an
exact analysis of the deformations and stress distributions in ﬁnite
cylinders of transversely isotropic and isotropic elastic materials is
conducted. The results show that the displacement and stress
ﬁelds in the region near the base plane of the cylinder are signiﬁ-
cantly different from those according to the simpliﬁed solution
that gives a uniaxial stress state. As the axial stiffness increases,
the end effect on the stress state in the cylinder under its own
weight decreases. The end effect is more pronounced in the cylin-
der with the bottom plane being perfectly bonded than in smooth
contact with a rigid base.

Abstract A state-space approach for exact analysis of axisymmetric deformation and stress
distribution in a circular cylindrical body of transversely isotropic material is developed.
By means of Hamiltonian variational formulation via Legendre’s transformation, the basic
equations in cylindrical coordinates are formulated into a state-space framework in which
the unknown state vector comprises the displacements and associated stress components
as the dual variables and the system matrix possesses the symplectic characteristics of a
Hamiltonian system. Upon delineating the symplecticity of the formulation, a viable solu-
tion approach using eigenfunction expansion is developed. For illustration, an exact analysis
of a finite thick-walled circular cylinder under internal and external pressures is presented,
with emphasis on the end effects.

1 Introduction
This work is concerned with development of a state-space approach for exact analysis of an
elastic cylindrical body. To bring the idea into focus, we consider a relatively simple problem
of axisymmetric deformation in a finite circular elastic cylinder under prescribed boundary
conditions (BC). When a circular cylindrical body is subjected to external loads independent
of θ , the problem is axially symmetric if the material is isotropic or transversely isotropic
with the z axis being the axis of rotational symmetry. It is well known that the problem

for transversely isotropic materials. For isotropic materials we have c33 = c11, c13 = c12,
c44 = c66 = (c11 − c12)/2, in addition.
The Lagrangian formulation of an elastic cylindrical body begins with the potential en-
ergy

where and hereafter the superscript T denotes the transpose, u is the displacement vector,

, U(u) is the strain energy density function, and
u = [ur uθ uz
]T
, F = [Fr Fθ Fz
]T
.
Upon expressing the strain energy density function U(u) in terms of ur , uθ and uz, the
Lagrangian for the problem is given by
L = L(u,u,z,u,r ) = r

)2 + c66
(
uθ,r − r−1uθ
)2] − r(Frur + Fθuθ + Fzuz), (3)
where a comma in the subscript denotes partial differentiation.
Minimizing  yields three second-order coupled partial differential equations in terms
of ur , uθ and uz, which are the governing equations of the problem by the Lagrangian
formulation.
In formulating the basic equations into the state-space framework in which the system
matrix is a Hamiltonian matrix, it is essential that the state vector be composed of dual vari-
ables. Duality of the state variables arises as a natural result of the Hamiltonian formulation.
Let the displacement vector u play the role of the dynamic variable and the coordinate
z play the role of the time variable in a dynamic system, i.e. q  u, q  u,z, according
to the notation in classical mechanics [5, 6]. The Hamiltonian H of a conservative system
is derived from the Lagrangian L by introducing a conjugate variable p associated with u
through the Legendre transformation
H(u,p,u,r ) = pT u,z − L(u,u,z,u,r ), (4)
such that
p = ∂L
∂u,z
. (5)
Replacing L in  by H via (4), performing δ = 0 and integration by parts, we obtain

The problem can be decomposed into two fundamental problems as follows:
(1) The first fundamental problem: Find X1 that satisfies
∂
∂z
X1 = HX1, Br (X1) = φ0(z) on r,−∞ < z < ∞, (14)
in which the traction and displacement on z are not specified. When the BC on r is
independent of z, this problem reduces to a generalized plane problem. When the BC
on r is homogeneous (φ0 = 0), the solution to (14) is trivial.
(2) The second fundamental problem: Find X2 that satisfies
∂
∂z
X2 = HX2, Br (X2) = 0 on r, Bz(X2) = ϕ0(r) − Bz(X1) on z, (15)
where the homogeneous state equation and the homogeneous BC on r constitute an
eigensystem. The eigen solution is required to satisfy the non-homogeneous end condi-
tions.
The solution of the problem defined by (13) is given by X = X1 + X2. Of the two fun-
damental problems the first one is relatively simple; the second one is more challenging, to
which it is possible to use separation of variables to seek the solution of the form

eμz, (16)
where Ur , Uθ , Trz and Tzz are unknown functions of r , the value of the constant parameter
μ may be zero or nonzero.
When μ = 0, (9) together with the homogeneous BC on the cylindrical surfaces reduces
to
Hψ = μψ, Br (ψ) = 0 on r, (17)
where

.
A salient feature of the formulation is that the matrix H in the eigen system defined by
(17) exhibits Hamiltonian characteristics such that L12 and L21 are symmetric matrix and the
matrix operator L∗11 is adjoint to L11. Such characteristics are of fundamental significance
in the framework, which will be delineated next.
4 Hamiltonian Characteristics
First of all, as shown in the Appendix, the adjoint system of (17) is
Hφ = −μφ, Br (φ) = 0, (18)
Axisymmetric Deformation of a Transversely Isotropic Cylindrical Body 137
When j = −i, the relation between ψ i and ψ−i is derived by considering the non-
homogeneous system with eigenvalue μi :
(H − μiI)ϕ = ψ i , Br (ϕ) = 0, (27)
which is unsolvable because (20) has a non-trivial solution.
Pre-multiplying (27) by φT J and integrating it over (a, b) yields
∫ b
a
φT JHϕdr = μi
∫ b
a
φT Jϕdr +
∫ b
a
φT Jψ idr, (28)
where φ is a vector function to be specified.
Integrating by parts the left-hand side of (28), making use of (JH)∗ = JH, we obtain
∫ b
a
ϕT JHφdr + μi
∫ b
a
ϕT Jφdr + B(φ,ϕ) =
∫ b
a
φT Jψ idr, (29)
where B(φ,ϕ) denotes the boundary integral term.
The adjoint of (27) is
(H + μiI)φ = 0, Br (φ) = 0, (30)
thence, on setting φ = ψ−i , (29) reduces to
∫ b
a
ψT−iJψ idr = 0, (31)
which is the solvability condition of (27).
On the other hand, knowing that (27) is unsolvable, it follows that (31) is not satisfied by
the associated eigenvectors, then
∫ b
a
ψTi Jψ−idr = −
∫ b
a
ψT−iJψ idr = 0. (32)
In summary, the symplectic orthogonal relations of the eigenvectors associated with non-
zero eigenvalues are
∫ b
a
ψTi Jψ j dr
{= 0 for j = −i
= 0 for j = −i (33)
The case of the zero eigenvalue (μi = 0) requires special consideration. It has been shown
that μ0 = 0 is a repeated eigenvalue. The two linearly independent eigenvectors ψ0(1) and
ψ0(2) are determined from the Jordan chain associated with μ0 = 0 by
Hψ (0)0 = 0, Br (ψ (0)0 ) = 0, (34)
Hψ (1)0 = ψ (0)0 , Br (ψ (1)0 ) = 0, (35)
from which
ψ0(1) = ψ (0)0 =
[
0 1 0 0
]
, (36)
ψ0(2) = ψ (1)0 + zψ (0)0 =
[
β1r 0 0 β2r
] + z [0 1 0 0] . (37)

where yn(λr) = Jn(λr); Yn(λr) (n = 0,1), denoting the Bessel functions of the first kind
and the second kind of order n, respectively, λ and ci (i = 1,2,3,4) are constants to be
determined.

equals to zero. This condition yields

To each κj there corresponds a solution of (47) determined within a constant Aj . It can
be shown, on account of positive-definiteness of the stiffness matrix, that κj (j = 1,2,3,4)
cannot be purely imaginary. Since y0(−κjμr) = y0(κjμr) and y1(−κjμr) = −y1(κjμr),
there are two linearly independent solutions derived from (45)–(50).
When μ = 0 in (16), the displacement and stress fields are independent of z. The solution
of (17) for μ = 0 is

The solution satisfying the BC on r = a and r = b for the case of the isotropic materials
can be determined in a similar manner. At this point, it remains to satisfy the end conditions
of the problem. This is best illustrated by a specific problem.
8 A Finite Thick-Walled Cylinder Under Uniform Pressures
Stress analysis of a thick-walled circular cylinder subjected to internal and external pres-
sures is usually conducted under the plane-strain assumption. The plane-strain solution was
believed to be a good approximation if the length of the cylinder is great in comparison with
its radii [1, 2]. To examine the conjecture, we consider a finite-length, thick-walled circular
cylinder under uniform pressures at r = a and r = b such that the BC on the cylindrical
surfaces are
[
rσrr rσrz
]
r=a =
[
apa 0
]
,
[
rσrr rσrz
]
r=b =
[
bpb 0
]
, (74)
where pa and pb denote the uniform internal and external pressures, respectively.
For illustration, the following end conditions at z = 0 and z = l are considered.
(1) Fixed ends which are perfectly bonded with the rigid base:
[
ur uz
]
z=0 =
[
ur uz
]
z=l =
[
0 0
]
. (75)
(2) Sliding-contact ends which are smoothly contact with the rigid base:
[
uz rσrz
]
z=0 =
[
uz rσrz
]
z=l =
[
0 0
]
. (76)
(3) Traction-free ends:
[
rσrz rσzz
]
z=0 =
[
rσrz rσzz
]
z=l =
[
0 0
]
. (77)
Axisymmetric Deformation of a Transversely Isotropic Cylindrical Body 145
(3) Traction-free ends:
F0(r) =
[
ur(r,0) uz(r,0) 0 0
]T
,
(85)
Fl (r) =
[
ur(r, l) uz(r, l) 0 0
]T
.
The solutions for the cases of sliding-contact ends and traction-free ends are easily ob-
tained by comparison of the coefficients at both sides of the respective equations. Thus, for
both ends being sliding-contact, we obtain A0 = B0 = Ai = A−i = 0 (i = 1,2,3, . . .), and
X(r) = X1(r), (86)
which indicates that the plane-strain solution for a circular tube under uniform pressures is
exact when both ends are sliding-contact with the rigid base.
For both ends being traction-free, we obtain Ai = A−i = 0 (i = 1,2,3, . . .),
B0 = − 2c13(pb − c
2pa)
(1 − c2)(c11 + c12)β2 , (87)
and
X(r) = X1(r) + (A0 + B0z)ψ (0)0 + B0ψ (1)0 (r), (88)
where the term associated with A0 is a rigid-body motion. The solution is the same as that
under the generalized plane-strain assumption [13–15].
For the case of both ends being fixed, however, one cannot determine the coefficients
from (81) and (82) by simple comparison of the coefficients. Similar situations occur for
other combinations of the end conditions. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to em-
ploy symplectic orthogonality to determine the unknown coefficients by using eigenfunction
expansion in the state space.
Before passing on, a few remarks on the coefficient determination are in order. Without
fully grasping the Hamiltonian characteristics of the eigensystem, one is likely to impose the
fixed end conditions on the displacement components and attempt to determine the unknown
constants from the resulting scalar equations. A difficult situation then arises—there are four
arbitrary scalar functions to be expanded into series in terms of the given functions with
the same set of unknown constants. Consequently, the number of systems of equations is
larger than the number of unknowns, rendering the equations inconsistent and unsolvable
in general. This is the main reason why it was unable to achieve a complete freedom in
prescribing arbitrary surface tractions or displacements for the problem. In few restrictive
cases where the system of equations is consistent and solvable, one often has to resort to
an approximate method to determine the unknown constants. It is well known that using an
approximate method to expand an arbitrary function into a series in terms of given functions
often leads to non-convergent results. There is no guarantee that methods of least squares or
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization [7, 16] will produce a valid solution. A solution scheme
for the problem along this line is limited in its use.
9 Determining the Unknown Constants
Returning to the task of determining the unknown constants A0, B0, Ai and A−i in (81)–
(82). To this end, multiplying both sides of (81) by [ψ (1)0 ]T J, [ψ (0)0 ]T J, ψT−iJ, and ψTi J,
Axisymmetric Deformation of a Transversely Isotropic Cylindrical Body 147
where the terms on the right-hand sides are completely known, the unknown functions are
the traction components σrz(r,0), σzz(r,0), σrz(r, l) and σzz(r, l) in the state vectors F0(r)
and Fl (r) for the fixed end conditions at z = 0 and z = l.
Equations (97)–(100) can be solved by using a standard method for the Fredholm inte-
gral equations [7, 16]. Essentially, the solution scheme is to replace the integral equations by
linear algebraic equations using a numerical integration formula such as a m-point Gaussian
quadrature formula [17], and then to evaluate the unknown functions at the assigned abscis-
sas. In so doing, (97)–(100) turn into a system of algebraic equations in which the unknowns
are σrz(rk,0), σzz(rk,0), σrz(rk, l), and σzz(rk, l) at the abscissas rk (k = 1,2, . . . ,m). There
are 4m unknown traction components at z = 0 and z = l in total. Successively putting
μi = 0, ±μ1, ±μ2, . . . ,±μ2m−1 in them, we arrive at a system of 4m linear algebraic
equations for the 4m unknown traction components at z = 0 and z = l. After determin-
ing σrz(r,0), σzz(r,0), σrz(r, l) and σzz(r, l), one can evaluate the integrals in (89)–(92) by
using the same integration formula and subsequently obtain the constants A0, B0, Ai and
A−i associated with the eigenvalues μi (i = 0,1,2, . . . , n), where the number of terms n
can be chosen as large as necessary to achieve a required accuracy of the solution.
10 Results and Discussions
To evaluate the end effects on the deformation and stress distributions, the following values
of the elastic constants are taken for computation: c33/c11 = 1 (isotropic material); 5, 10 and
c12/c11 = c13/c11 = c44/c11 = 1/3 for transversely isotropic materials. These values are typ-
ical for engineering materials, ranging from aluminum (isotropic material) to epoxy-based
fiber-reinforced composites such as glass/epoxy and graphite/epoxy (transversely isotropic
material). The dimensions of the tube are taken to be c = a/b = 1/5 and l/b = 20.
For the given material constants and dimensions, the eigenvalues of the problem are
determined. All the eigenvalues for the isotropic material are complex conjugate, and
the eigenvalues for transversely isotropic materials are mostly real. The first eigenvalues
are zero and repeated, associated with which are linearly z-dependent displacements and
z-independent stresses. The stress disturbance due to the end effect are essentially associ-
ated with the non-zero eigenvalues.
The eigenvalues are useful in evaluating the range of the stress disturbance due to the
end effect. It can be deduced from the solution form (80) that the stress diffusion from the
end z = 0 of a long tube is essentially dictated by the terms associated with exp(−μiz) in
that the terms associated with exp(μiz) which produce unbounded stresses as z → ∞ for a
semi-infinite long cylinder should be dropped before imposing the end conditions at z = 0.
With this in mind, it is appropriate to take the real part of μ and define
L = ln 100
Re(μ)
, (101)
as the characteristic decay length measured from the end z = 0 beyond which the series
terms contribute only 1% in magnitude to the deformations and stresses in a long cylinder.
In other words, the deformations and stresses in the region beyond the distance L from the
end z = 0 are essentially independent of the end conditions so that the plane-strain solution
can be used as a good approximation. As such, the characteristic decay length L is a simple
measure to estimate the stress disturbance from the end of a long circular cylinder. Naturally,
the smallest non-zero eigenvalue should be used to evaluate the largest L.
For an isotropic tube (c33 = c11), the characteristic decay length L = 1.846b. This sug-
gests that the stress disturbance due to the end effect in a long homogeneous, isotropic tube

A Hamiltonian State Space Formalism for Piezothermoelasticity 
Chang H.H.1, Tarn J.Q. 
Department of Civil Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, ROC 
Analysis of electro-thermo-mechanical responses of a piezoelectric body is much more complicated 
than its elastic counterpart due to electromechanical coupling. In the present work, we develop a 
Hamiltonian state space formalism for 3D problems of piezothermoelasticity in which the 
generalized displacement vector and the generalized stress vectors are taking as the state variables. 
The basic equations of piezothermoelasticity are formulated into the state space framework in 
which two simple and elegant, yet explicit matrix equations in terms of the generalized 
displacement vector and generalized stress vectors embrace the basic 3D equations in full. 
Remarkably, the state equation and the output equation for piezothermoelasticity are identical to 
their thermoelastic counterparts, differing only in the dimensions and entities of the corresponding 
matrices. A salient feature of the formulation is that it possesses the characteristics of a Hamiltonian 
system, which provide an essential basis for using eigenfunction expansion to solve 3D problems. 
The eigensolution associated with the zero eigenvalue gives rise to solutions to problems of 
generalized plane strain, generalized torsion and generalized bending in anisotropic elasticity. 
Correspondence between piezothermoelasticiy and anisotropic thermoelasticity in the state space 
setting enables us to determine the solutions for various piezothermoelastic problems by extension 
of the corresponding elastic solutions. In many cases, the solutions can be obtained simply by 
replacement of the elastic matrices. For illustration, exact solutions for a number of problems, each 
in its own right, are determined within the framework.

德國交通之發達是世界有目共睹的，各聯邦間有長程火車或過夜火車作聯繫，單一聯邦
內各城鎮間以區域火車和捷運相連結，城鎮內則有輕軌道列車和公車作為短程運輸工具，整
個國家交通構成緊密繁雜的運輸網絡，各種運輸工具都有電子看板顯示來車等待狀況，且彼
此間緊密搭配，馬路上幾乎很難看到摩托車，但卻是要到哪裡都十分方便。相形之下，臺灣
的整體大眾運輸網絡就顯得像是在草創期，許多大城市在上下班巔峰時期往往是車水馬龍、
寸步難行，十分不便民。德國的大眾運輸網絡之規劃確實值得我們借鏡。
