ABSTRACT 
The purpose of present study was to examine the health problems for long-haul flight travelers. A 
total of 242 travelers who have been overseas traveling were interviewed. The questionnaire were 
designed to determine the traveler’s background information, trips, cabin seats, preferable seat 
position, physical activities in flight, eating diary (foods or drink), and discomfort rating for body 
areas during the flight period. In addition, a validated Verran and Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale was 
used to measure sleep disturbance, sleep effectiveness, and sleep supplementation. Results of the 
analysis showed that there were less than 20% of the travelers understood economy-class 
syndrome or Deep Vein Thrombosis. About 67.8% of the travelers have preferable seat positions, 
and there were about 78%, 18% and 4% of them preferring for window side, aisle side and near 
the emergency exit, respectively. Only 30% of the travelers could take enough rest and less than 
30% of the travelers would do physical activities (e.g. in-seat exercises, upper body and breathing 
exercises, short walks etc.) more than three times during flight. About 50% of travelers drink less 
than two cups of water. However, more than 60% of the travelers want to drink some cups of 
coffee or tea. In addition, 29% of the travelers would drink alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, 
whiskey etc.). For uncomfortable rating by body map, the most musculoskeletal problems during 
flight period were reported with neck (48%), low back area (46%), knees (42%), shoulders area 
(40%), and thigh (36%). For the overall rating, about 33% of the travelers feel uncomfortable 
after long-haul flight. For sleep problems, the mean scores of sleep disturbance, sleep 
effectiveness, and sleep supplementation were 346.4, 120.3, and 197.3 respectively. Furthermore, 
an ANOVA was conducted to examine the effects of trips and cabin class on sleep quality. 
Results of analysis showed that there were significant differences in sleep quality between trips 
and cabin class. Travelers have higher sleep disturbance, and lower sleep effectiveness after long-
haul trips (e.g. from Taiwan to USA or European area). Of course, higher sleep disturbance, and 
lower sleep effectiveness could be reported by travelers in economic-class. Results of sedentary 
experiment showed that seat duration time were significant effects on physiology responses and 
discomfort ratings. Finally, results of present study could provide the information for promoting 
health of long-haul flight travelers and airline companies have the responsibility to assist and 
educate in preventing health problems for long-haul flight.

1. Introduction 
With the prospect of ever-larger commercial aircraft (e.g. Airbus 380) and increasing population, 
passenger-miles will continue to increase – likely doubling by year 2020 (Bergau, 1996). A long-
haul flight is a flight which is over seven hours in length and often involves intercontinental travel, 
for example, flights from Asia to the Americas. They are associated with negative feelings after 
arrivals that constitute travel fatigue (Reilly, 1997). Symington and Stack (1977) have reported 
cases of multi-vehicle–induced PE after travel by automobile (all were drivers), rail alone, 
rail/ship and aircraft. They referred to the ‘economy-class syndrome’ as it applied to venous 
coagulation problems with air travel because it is much more common in economy class (than in

frequencies of physical activity in flight, eating foods and drinking beverages. In addition, ratings 
of musculoskeletal uncomfortable during flight were evaluated by body map. The areas of neck, 
shoulders, upper back, lower back, elbows, hands, buttocks and thighs, knees, ankles and feet 
were evaluated on five levels (very uncomfortable, uncomfortable, normal, comfortable, very 
comfortable).  
2.1.2 Verran and Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale 
 
A validated Chinese version questionnaire of Verran and Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scale (VSH Sleep 
Scale) was applied to assessment the sleep quality (Lin and Tsai, 2003). In addition, the VSH 
Sleep Scale utilizes three scales (sleep disturbance, sleep effectiveness, and sleep supplementation) 
to characterize overall sleep quality (Snyder-Halpern and Verran, 1987). Each characteristic is 
measured using a 100 mm visual analogue scale and the total score for the primary outcome of 
sleep disturbance is a sum of the scores from each scale (total score maximum 800). A lower total 
score on this scale indicates a lower degree of sleep disturbance. The secondary outcome 
parameters for this study included the degree of sleep effectiveness and sleep supplementation 
(and their determinants) as measured by the VSH Sleep Scale. The sleep effectiveness scale 
measures both quality and length of sleep as perceived by the patient using the following four 
characteristics: rest upon awakening, wake after final arousal, subjective quality of sleep, sleep 
sufficiency evaluation. A visual analogue scale is used to measure each of the four items and these 
scores are summed to represent a total score. The maximum possible total score is 400 with a 
higher score representing greater sleep effectiveness. The sleep supplementation scale measures 
the degree to which the bulk sleep period is augmented with additional sleep time. The three 
characteristics measured are daytime sleep, morning sleep, and afternoon sleep. The scores from 
each of these scales are summed to obtain a total score (total score maximum 300). A higher total 
score on this scale represents a worse outcome, as more supplemental sleep was needed (Snyder-
Halpern and Verran, 1987). 
 
2.2 Experimental study 
 
2.2.1. Participants 
 
Thirteen participated in the experiments after providing informed consents with respect to the 
investigative procedures. The mean age of the sample population was 24.4 years (range 21-28), 
mean stature 169 cm (range 150-189), and mean body mass 71 kg (range 40-92). All subjects 
were healthy and reported no musculoskeletal problems or cardiovascular diseases which might 
be detrimental to physical performance. In addition, all recruits were instructed to avoid vigorous 
physical activity and alcohol consumption during the 12 hours prior to the experiment. 
 
2.2.2. Apparatus and materials 
 
A mutli-physiological record system was used to measure heart rate and SpO2 continuously 
(Biopac Systems MP150, USA). In addition, a blood pressure measuring equipment was utilized 
to continuously measure blood pressure (Omrom, Model HEM-7071, Japan). In addition, the

3.2 Discomfort rating by body map 
 
Only 30% of the travelers could take enough rest. The uncomfortable rating of neck, shoulders, 
upper back, lower back, elbows, hands, buttocks and thighs, knees, ankles and feet areas were 
evaluated by body map. Figure 1 indicated that travelers had very uncomfortable and 
uncomfortable on body areas. The most musculoskeletal problems during flight period were 
reported with neck (48%), low back area (46%), knees (42%), shoulders area (40%), and thigh 
(36%). For the overall rating, about 33% of the travelers feel uncomfortable after long-haul flight. 
Prolonged periods of sitting caused these results. In addition, Abramowitz and Gertz 2007) 
suggests that the leg movement and calf compression associated with the modified airline seat 
may decrease the probability of DVT due to prolonged periods of sitting by reducing venous 
stasis. Both seat redesign and in-flight physical activities of travelers could decrease these 
discomfort.
