Abstract 
Rainfall is infiltrated through the surface into the vadose zone and induces the variation of 
the ground water level.  However, the hydrological system of the rainfall infiltration is complex.  
How to establish the relationship between the rainfall and variation of the ground water level 
becomes an important topic.  In this study, the grey system theory is utilized to investigate the 
relationship among rainfall, unsaturated water pressure and ground water level.  First, the grey 
relational analysis among ground water level, rainfall and unsaturated water pressure are 
performed.  Six different depths of unsaturated water pressure are used for the grey relational 
analysis and the depth with the optimal grey relational grade is obtained.  Then the GM(1,3) 
model is established based on sequences of ground water level, rainfall and unsaturated water 
pressure in the depth with the optimal grey relational grade.  Second, the GM(1,2) model is 
established only using the sequences of ground water level and rainfall data.  The comparison of 
the GM(1,2) and the GM(1,3) models are performed to assess the accuracy of ground water level 
forecast.  Finally, the concept of the time lag is used to reestablish the grey models GM(1,2) and 
GM(1,3) and predict the variation of ground water level.  The results show that the GM(1,3) 
model has the higher accuracy than the GM(1,2) model for ground water level forecast.  The 
optimal time lag is equal to 23 hours in the study site.  The accuracy of the ground water level 
forecast is higher in the GM(1,3) model with the time lag than the one without it.

1. Introduction 
Typhoon and Plum rains always bring abundant rainfall to lead to some natural disasters.  
One of the common natural disasters in Taiwan is landslide.  The roads and bridges are always 
damaged due to the landslide.  It not only affects the residence security but also enhances the 
difficulty of disaster prevention and rescue.  Some researches have indicated that the soil water 
content was the one of the major factors to lead the landside (Chen, 1991; Yeh, 2003, Chen, 
2008).  The landslide will occur when the soil water content exceeds the saturated soil water 
content.  Rainfall is infiltrated through the surface into the vadose zone and induces the variation 
of ground water level.  The ground water level will be uplifted rapidly due to rainfall infiltration 
and the soil water content will be also increased gradually.  The higher soil water content the 
higher risk to the landside.  However, the hydrological system from the rainfall infiltration to the 
ground water table is complex.  How to establish the relationship between the rainfall and the 
The moving average method is an improvement of the arithmetic average.  It is used to 
smooth out short-term fluctuations, thus highlighting longer-term trends or cycles.  The formula 
is defined as follows. 
MA
MAkxkxkxkxkx )1()2()1()()(* +−++−+−+= … , 11≥+− MAk  (1) 
where  is the original sequences, ( )kx ( )kx*  is the sequences after taking the moving average 
and MA is the data number of moving average. 
(2) Anti-trend Method 
In order to let the each sequence has the same trend such as positive correlation or negative 
correlation, the anti-trend method is used as follows. 
)( )(  .max)(* kxkxkx −=  (2) 
where  is the maximum value of the original sequences, ( )kx.max ( )kx*  is the sequences after 
performing the anti-trend procedure. 
(3)Interval Value Method 
When the sequence has slight fluctuation in the bounded range of the sequence, the interval 
value method is used to highlight the variation of the sequence.  The formula is expressed as 
)( min.)(  .max
)( .min)( )(*
kxkx
kxkxkx −
−=  (3) 
where  is the minimum value of the original sequences, ( )kx.min ( )kx*  is the sequences after 
performing the interval value procedure. 
 
2.2 Grey Relational Analysis 
The grey relational analysis is proposed to analyze the correlation between two sequences.  
The grey relational coefficient and grey relational grade are two used factors to quantify grey 
relational analysis.  Assume that the original sequence of data is expressed as 
{ } ( )( ) ( )( ) ( )( ){ }mxxxx 0000 ,,2,1 …=  (4) 
where the superscription (0) of  represents the original series, m is the number of the 
sequence.  Here we define  is the main behavior sequence and 
 are the factor sequences.  Thus the difference between each two 
sequences is defined as 
( )0x
)()0(1 kx
)( ,, )( ),( )0()0(3
)0(
2 kxkxkx N"
)()()(, kxkxk jji i −=Δ ,   Nji ,,2,1 …== (5) 
where the sign  is the absolute value.  Then the grey relational coefficients are calculated by 
( ) )(
)()(  )(
.max,
.max.min
, kk
kkkr
ji
ji Δ×+Δ
Δ×+Δ= ς
ς  (6) 
where 
)()( min.)(.min kxkxk ji −=Δ  and )()( max.)(.max kxkxk ji −=Δ . (7) 
Here the ς  is the distinguishing coefficient in the range of [ ]1,0  and is given to 0.5 usually.  
After the grey relational coefficients are obtained, the grey relational grade is given by 
)()()1()( )1(33

The solution of Eq.(19) is obtained similarly as

2.3.3 GM(1,2) and GM(1,3) Models with Time Lag  
Rainfall is infiltrated through the surface into the vadose zone and reaches the ground water 
table.  The time lag means the difference of the infiltration time from surface to ground water 
table.  The time lag lets the ground water level will not respond immediately when the rainfall 
occurs.  Thus the concept of the time lag is utilized to reconstruct the grey model of rainfall and 
ground water level in this study.  When the time lag between the main behavior sequence and 
the factor sequence is existence, the matrix form of the grey model G(1,N) can be rewritten as

2.3.4 Residual Test 
The residual test is used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed grey model and the error 
between the prediction data and the observation data.  In this study, the accuracy of the proposed 
grey model is evaluated using the error formula as expressed as 
%100
)(

)0()0(
)0( ×−=
kx
kxkxke  (24) 
where  is the residual value, ( ) )(0 ke ( )( )kx 0  is the original observation data and  is the 
prediction data.  The accuracy  can be expressed as 
( )( )kx 0ˆ
)()0( kq
)(%100)( )0()0( kekq −=  (25) 
When the accuracy  is larger than 70%, the forecasting grey model is qualified (Deng 
and Kuo, 1996).  Here the method of root mean square error (RMSE) is used for residual test 
between the prediction data and the observation data as follows.

4.3 Grey Model Construction and Grey Prediction 
 Before the grey model construction, the data number of grey model construction is needed to 
be determined.  In this study, both 4-points and multi-points methods are used to construct the 
GM(1,2) and GM(1,3) models.  The data period of grey prediction and model verification of all 
cases is from 16:00 on April 9 to 23:00 on April 15, a total of 152 data.  Therefore, the data 
from 12:00 to 15:00 on April 9 is selected to construct 4-points grey model.  The data for 
multi-points grey model constructing is selected from 0:00 on April 3 to 15:00 on April 9, a total 
of 159 data.  Finally, the concept of time lag is applied to reconstruct the grey model which has 
the optimal prediction results.   
 
4.3.1 Results of GM(1,2) Model 
Here we define the sequence of ground water level is main behavior sequence ( )( )kx 01  and 
the sequence of rainfall is factor sequence ( )( )kx 02 .  Therefore, the solutions of 4-points and 
multi-points GM(1,2) models are obtained respectively as

Figure 9 shows the prediction of ground water level of 4-points GM(1,2) model.  The results 
show that the deviation between the prediction and observation data is increasing rapidly as time 
increasing.  The accuracy of 4-points GM(1,2) model construction  is 99.990632% and 
the value of RMSE is 0.958 m.

4.3.3 Results of Time-Lag GM(1,3) Model  
Before to construct the time-lag GM(1,3) model, the optimal time lag between ground water level 
and rainfall is needed to be determined, as well as between ground water level and unsaturated 
water pressure.  Figure 13 shows the distribution of grey relational grade versus time lag 
between ground water level and rainfall.  The results show the highest grey relational grade is 
obtained when time lag is 23 hours.  Figure 14 displays the distribution of grey relational grade 
versus time lag between ground water level and unsaturated water pressure.  It shows the 
optimal time lag is 12 hours.   
In order to determine the optimal data number of grey model construction, the analysis of 
RMSE values versus different data number of grey model construction is performed in this study.  
Figure 15 shows the distribution of RMSE versus the data number of grey model construction.  
We found the optimal RMSE value is obtained when the data number of grey model construction 
is 29.  Therefore, the data number of 29 is used to construct time-lag GM(1,3) model. 
The solution of multi-points GM(1,3) model with time lag is obtained as

Figure 16 shows the prediction of ground water level of multi-points GM(1,3) model with time 
lag.  The accuracy  is 99.997231% and the value of RMSE is 0.008 m.  The results 
show when the time lag is considered into grey model construction, the accuracy of prediction 
will be enhanced.  Finally, the multi-points GM(1,3) model with time lag is found to be the 
optimal model for ground water level forecast in this study.

5. Conclusions 
In this study, the grey system theory is utilized to investigate the relationship among ground 
water level, rainfall and unsaturated water pressure.  Our study leads to the following 
conclusions: 
1. Deviation between the prediction and observation data of 4-points grey models is increasing 
rapidly as time increasing.  The multi-points grey models have the better prediction of 
ground water level in our study site.   
2. The GM(1,3) models have the higher prediction accuracy than GM(1,2) models.  It implies 
that unsaturated water pressure is aid to enhance the accuracy of grey prediction of ground 
water level and is needed to be considered for grey model construction. 
3. The optimal time lag is 23 hours between ground water level and rainfall data and 12 hours 
between ground water level and unsaturated water pressure.  The accuracy of the ground 
water level forecast is higher in the model with the time lag than the one without it.  The 
results show the time lag is indispensable for grey model construction. 
4. The groundwater level is affected by the soil water content apparently, thus the prediction of 
ground water level variation becomes an important topic.  In this study, we successfully 
apply the grey system theory to forecast the variation of ground water level.  The time lag 
between ground water level and rainfall and between ground water level and unsaturated water 
pressure are obtained through the grey relational analysis.  We expect that the results can be 
utilized to evaluate the soil water content of unsaturated soil and will be aid to the forecasting 
the groundwater level of saturated soil in the future.
