2. Abstract 
 
For this innovation study for design and fabrication of a high performance micro proton 
exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), we focus on the current measurements of current density 
and water distribution in the flow field plates. The effect of different operating parameters on micro 
PEMFCs performances was experimentally studied for four different flow-field configurations 
(interdigitated, serpentine, parallel, and mesh) which are manufactured by micro-electromechanical 
systems (MEMS). The micro PEMFCs were designed and fabricated in-house through a deep UV 
lithography technique and the SU-8 photoresist was used as microstructure material for fuel cell 
flow-field plates. In this study, time-dependent measurements for the mapping of current distribution 
via a segmented flow field plate approach in a micro proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell 
were conducted and the effects of flow field configuration were studied and discussed under fixed 
operating conditions. The results show that, among four flow fields studied herein, the interdigitated 
flow channel has the most uniform transient current distribution with a much higher water content at 
an early phase (say t < 0.5 hrs) than those of the other three channels: serpentine, mesh and parallel, 
indicating an adequate oxygen concentration of the airflow on the cathode. In addition, the effect of 
water content on current distribution was also examined and discussed. It was found that the volume 
of water in flow channels could reach a steady value of 45% for all four flow fields after a three-hour 
operation. 
Keywords: Current distribution; Water formation; Flow field plate; Segmented mapping method. 
 
3. Introduction 
 
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells have long been recognized as one of the most 
promising candidates for future power generating systems, especially in portable electronic devices. 
This is because the PEM fuel cell presents a high power density and operates at a relatively low 
temperature, two qualities which make it ideal for portable systems. However, the performance of 
low temperature fuel cells, like PEM fuel cells, needs substantial improvement concerning several 
 4
uniformly as possible and with minimum mass transport limitations. The superiority of a certain 
flow field upon others is therefore detected at higher current density, especially in the transport 
polarization regime. In the present experiments, current densities around 200 mA/cm2 correspond 
to the mass transport limitation regime. Although the interdigitated flow field has been proven to 
be better than the others, its performance was still low as compared to those of previous studies of 
conventional large PEM fuel cells. This is perhaps because the present study of the micro PEM 
fuel cell is operated at a low temperature of 25oC for cell phone applications. Fig. 9 and 10 shows 
in the inset are the water content measurement after dissembling the fuel cell with the corrections 
made for water evaporation of the airflow while the experiments progress. Since the airflow is 
very sensitive to small blockage due to the water formation, this is thought to initiate an 
inadequate oxygen concentration on the cathode for mesh and parallel flow fields as discussed 
earlier. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
z Demonstrate the ability of the measurement system  
In this study, we find the interdigatated flow filed would give the most uniform and the 
highest local current density compared to those of mesh, parallel, and serpentine flow fields 
during the entire time period (i.e. 0 ≤ t ≤ 3 hrs) under study. As time approaches 30 minutes, all 
four flow fields would obtain a nearly steady-state local current density distribution (in Fig. 5). As 
time goes on (≤ 3 hours), local current density decreases due to liquid water formation and 
flooding (in Fig. 6). 
 
z Effect of water formation on current distribution 
The product water formation at the cathode side can not be seen until t ≥ 5 mins for all the 
four flow fields under study (in Fig. 7). The water bubble formation follows the sequence of: 
water droplet, condensation, and finally fogging with the maximum droplet size of 100 µm in 
diameter. The product water is proportional to the local current density, which indicates that the 
interdigitated flow field would have the largest amount of liquid water in channels (≈ 27%) at t = 
30 mins. However, it would nearly reach a constant volume fraction of 45 % of the product water 
for four flow fields at t = 180 mins. 
 
z Effect of flow field configuration on current distribution 
In this study, we find out the interdigitated flow field plate of fuel cell reaches the highest 
current density output, and its product water is more than other three flow field types because of 
its high electrochemical reaction activity. But the serpentine flow field can obtain most uniform 
current density distribution when operating 30 minutes or 180 minutes. And the flow field 
geometric structure helps reactant gas diffusing to the reactant area in fuel cell uniformly. Besides, 
the serpentine flow field can eliminate the product water accumulated in flow plate effectively.
