I摘要
氣候變遷之研究多著重在全球或區域尺度於空間與年或季節時間尺度上之影響。然
而，實際於工程規劃與設計上，需要使用之資料為局部(空間)和事件(時間)尺度。因此，
本研究欲建立一序率暴雨模擬模式(SRSM)，以繁衍連續之暴雨歷程，不僅可提供局部和
事件尺度之資料，且可應用於氣候變遷對設計降雨量之影響評估。本參數化之序率模擬模
式，可利用三參數以表示暴雨歷程中之暴雨事件：(1)降雨事件發生間距，(2)降雨延時及
總降雨量之聯合機率分佈及(3)總降雨量之時間分佈。
颱風事件次數之改變即表示降雨事件間隔之改變，因此藉由本模式於特定氣候變遷狀
態之設定，如平均颱風事件之次數增加或減少，可提供氣候變遷於設計降雨量之定量評
估。本模式之模擬結果顯示，如果一年的颱風事件次數為近年平均的 4.5 次增加為 5 次，
則延時為 1 小時(24 小時)，重現期距為 100 年之設計暴雨深度將會增加 25%(7.7%);而延
時為 1 小時(24 小時)，重現期距為 10 年之設計暴雨深度將會增加 13%(6.1%)。

Abstract
Many studies related to climate change focused on global, continental or regional scale
effect in space and annual or seasonal scale effect in time. However, for practical planning
and engineering design, it is necessary to deal with local (spatial) and event (temporal) scales.
The paper presents the development of a continuous stochastic storm-rainfall simulation
model (SRSM) which can accommodate the aforementioned scales and provide quantitative
assessment of the impact on design storm depth under given scenarios of climate change. The
SRSM is a parametric stochastic simulation model which considers random processes of four
major storm types: frontal rainfall, Mei-Yu, convective storms and typhoons occurring
annually in Taiwan. Random process of a storm rainfall event is characterized by (1)
inter-arrival time of storm events, (2) joint probability distribution of storm duration and total
rainfall depth and (3) time distribution of the total depth. Under certain scenarios of climate
change, i.e. the average number of typhoons events for the study site increases or decrease, we
assess the impact on design storm depth. Changes in the number of typhoon events
corresponds to changes in the inter-arrival time, and therefore the SRSM can provide a
quantitative assessment of climate change effect on design storm. Our simulation results show
that if the annual number of typhoons increases from current average of 4.5 events to 5 events,
the 1-hr (24-hr), 100-year design storm depth will increase by 25% (7.7%); whereas the 1-hr
(24-hr), 10-year design storm depth will increase by 13% (6.1%).

2數會呈現一特殊統計分佈，此分佈稱之為卜阿松分佈（Poisson Distribution），此歷程則稱
為卜阿松歷程（Poisson Process）。歷程中兩事件發生間距之機率分佈為指數分佈
（Exponential Distribution）。針對不同類型之歷史降雨事件分析其指數分布參數，再利用
指數分布之隨機模擬決定個別降雨事件發生之時間。
經檢定降雨事件與事件發生間距為指數分佈。因此，欲模擬整個卜阿松隨機歷程時，
先設定欲模擬之時間長度 T，且分析指數分佈機率密度函數之主要參數，即可進行模擬。
本研究中卜阿松歷程之模擬步驟為：(a)先利用逆轉換法產生均勻分佈  1,0U 之隨機表
現值 u 。(b)指數分佈之隨機表現值 e， ue ln1

 。(c)將每次指數分佈表現值累加，若累
加值大於欲模擬之歷程長度 T 時，則模擬停止；若未達歷程長度，則重複步驟 a。
3.2 事件總降雨量與延時之模擬
一般而言，降雨延時越長則總降雨量越大，故兩者具有聯合機率分布。本研究將分
析降雨延時與總降雨量之個別機率分布與聯合機率分布。最後再以雙變數序率模擬
(bivariate stochastic simulation)之方式，模擬個別事件之降雨延時與總降雨量。
本研究利用雙變數指數分佈模擬(Bivariate Exponential Distribution Simulation)，以模
擬單一事件之降雨延時及總降雨量。本研究採用 Marshall 及 Olkin(1967)發展出來的雙變
數指數分佈系統(MOBED)。

由上列式子可知，進行雙變數指數分佈模擬時，先分別計算降雨延時與總降雨量之平
均值與相關係數，即可得到三個參數 1、 2及 12 。以單變數模擬方式產生三個具指數分
佈(參數分別為 1、 2與 12 )之隨機變數 Z1、Z2 與 Z12之表現值 z1、z2 與 z12。模式中，令
x=min(z1,z12), y=min(z2,z12)，則(x,y)為 BEDS 的一個表現值。
3.3 事件總降雨量之時間分布模擬
單一事件歷程中降雨量之時間變異可視為一隨機歷程。降雨隨機歷程之模擬一般採
用固定時間間距模擬。若以固定時間間距(例如一小時)為單位分析降雨歷程，則必須對歷
程中之每一個時距，研究其機率分布特性(包括分布型式與機率分布參數) 。但由於降雨
事件之延時因個別事件而異，若採用固定時間間距之模擬方式，勢必無法對相同類型之所
有降雨事件建立一種共同之序率模擬模式。Cheng et al. (2001)依據簡單尺度不變性(simple
scaling)，將各種不同延時之降雨事件無因次化，而得到無因次降雨(降雨量百分率)之時間
分布。依此方式得到之無因次降雨之時間分布具有一階高斯馬可夫歷程之特性。本研究中
將針對各種不同類型降雨，分析其馬可夫歷程特性，以繁衍一年中各種類型降雨事件之降
4均勻，因此本研究在歷年時雨量之分析上，區分為梅雨(5~6 月)、颱風雨與對流雨(7~10
月)及鋒面雨(11～次年 4 月)，共四種降雨型態之資料。
4.2 降雨事件分析
颱風類型降雨對所帶來的災害較為嚴重，因此研究中先以颱風類型降雨為例，分析
模式之建立及其對氣候變遷所造成之影響。選擇一個適宜的降雨事件間距分割原始降雨資
料，使得分割後降雨事件發生間距具有指數分佈特性。研究中設定降雨深度門檻值為
0.5mm，將降雨事件為延時 1 小時及總降雨量 0.5mm 影響甚小事件移除。對於 7 月～10
月對流雨及颱風類型之降雨分割，採用事件間距為 8 小時，且以延時 12 小時為基準，延
時大於 12 小時者，則視為颱風，則劃分出颱風事件最接近真實的歷史事件。依據上述條
件進行降雨事件分割。將切割完成之降雨事件，利用科司試驗在顯著水準 5％下，對降雨
事件間距、降雨事件發生間距、降雨延時與總降雨量等四參數進行檢定，如表 2 所示。檢
定結果顯示所有測站之假設均未被否定，即本流域之降雨特性呈指數分佈之假設成立。
4.3 降雨事件特性模擬
由前人研究中，可發現在模擬降雨歷程時，一般先進行降雨事件發生間距之模擬，再
進行降雨事件之延時及總降雨量之模擬。利用此法模擬時會產生模擬之延時可能會大於降
雨事件發生間距，若將此情形略去則會無法反應真實降雨狀況。因此，在本研究中先進行
降雨事件之延時及總降雨量之模擬，再進行降雨事件間距之模擬。
4.3.1 降雨事件延時及總降雨量之模擬
為了使模擬之結果能符合真實的降雨特性，本研究採用雙變數指數分佈模擬。因為颱
風事件之延時大於 12 小時，因此進行延時之模擬時，利用雙參數指數分佈以進行模擬。
首先計算所有降雨事件之平均降雨延時、總降雨量平均及降雨延時與總降雨量之相關係
數。再利用雙變數指數分佈模擬每場降雨事件之降雨延時及總降雨量。表 3 與表 4 為原始
事件與模擬事件之降雨延時與總雨量之統計特性(平均值與標準偏差) 比較表，且圖 1 為
其比較圖。可發現雙變數指數分佈模擬的結果與原始事件統計特性非常接近且模擬結果亦
符合降雨延時與總降雨量之相關特性。
4.3.2 降雨事件間距之模擬
颱風事件之降雨事件間距大於 8 小時，因此進行降雨事件間距之模擬時，利用雙參數
指數分佈以進行模擬。雙參數指數分佈之表示式，如(12)式所示。

發現降雨事件間距之模擬在平均值與標準偏差之比較圖上，模擬結果皆與原始資料之統計
特性相近，即表示本研究之暴雨模擬模式可充分掌握降雨事件之統計特性。
4.3.3 降雨事件發生間距之檢核
由前人研究可知降雨事件發生間距會呈一指數分佈。本研究中先進行降雨事件之延時
及總降雨量之模擬，再進行降雨事件間距之模擬。因此，於延時及降雨事件間距模擬完成
後，即可得降雨事件發生間距（其值等於延時及降雨事件間距之總和）。再進行降雨事件

Abstract
Remote sensing images and technologies have been widely applied to environmental monitoring, in
particular landuse/landcover classification and change detection. However, the uncertainties involved in
such applications have not been fully addressed. In this paper two hypothesis-test-based change detection
methods, namely the bivariate joint distribution method and the conditional distribution method, are
proposed to tackle the uncertainties in change detection by making decisions based on the desired level of
significance. Both methods require a data set of class-dependent no-change pixels to form the basis for
class-dependent hypothesis test. Using an exemplar study area in central Taiwan, performance of the
proposed methods are shown to be significantly superior to two other commonly applied methods (the post-
classification comparison and the image differencing methods) in terms of the overall change detection
accuracies. The conditional distribution method takes into consideration the correlation between digital
numbers of the pre- and post-images and the effect of the known pre-image digital number on the range of
the post-image digital number, and therefore yields the highest change detection accuracy. It is also
demonstrated that the class-dependent change detection is crucial for accurate landuse/landcover change
detection.
1. Introduction
Landuse/landcover (LULC) change detection using remotely sensed images has been widely applied
for environmental monitoring. Many methods of change detection have been proposed including post-
classification comparison, temporal image differencing, temporal image ratioing, image regression,
multifractal analysis, principal component analysis, change vector analysis, and multivariate alteration
detection (Nielsen et al., 1998). Lunetta and Elvidge (1999) and Deer (1995) gave thorough reviews for
change detection techniques. All change detection methods involve usage of multi-temporal images that are
acquired in different dates and have different view angles, sun angles, atmospheric conditions, and spatial
coverages. Therefore, prior to the implementation of change detection algorithms, radiometric and
geometric corrections need to be conducted to reduce errors in change detection. Radiometric correction
can be done by methods such as the dark object subtraction (DOS), image regression, and other more
sophisticated methods which may require measurements of atmospheric optical depth (Song, et al., 2001;
Deer, 1995). The effect of misregistration on change detection has been addressed by Swain et al. (1982)
and Townshed et al. (1992). In addition, among all change detection methods the image differencing method
(including differencing on raw images and transformed images like NDVI) is most widely applied
(Weismiller et al., 1977; Brera and Shahrokhi, 1978; Coiner, 1980; Jensen and Toll, 1982; Nelson, 1983;
Singh, 1986; Vogelmann, 1988; Cheng et al., 2004). It generally uses a threshold for grey levels of the
image used for change detection to identify pixels associated with LULC changes. The image used for
change detection is a difference image derived from the raw or transformed multi-temporal images with its
digital numbers reflective of LULC changes. The threshold value is usually chosen as multiples of the
standard deviation of digital numbers of the difference image. Different threshold values have been
suggested (Liu, 1983; Nelson, 1983; Ridd and Liu; 1998; Fung and LeDrew, 1988; Sohl, 1999) and no
single threshold value can be universally applied. In addition, how much confidence can be expected for the
results of change detection is seldom addressed except in rare cases where adequate validation data are
3The relative radiometric normalization techniques assume that digital values of the corresponding
pixels in multi-date images are linearly related. The linear relationship can be determined by a least squares
regression. Each regression model contains an additive term (interception) that accounts for the difference
in upwelled radiance between dates and a multiplicative term (slope) that accounts for the difference in
detector calibration, sun-target-sensor geometry, and atmospheric transmittance between dates.
In this study the lowest digital numbers were assumed to represent the values contributed by upwelled
radiances and were subtracted from the original digital values of the satellite images. Table 1 illustrates the
lowest digital numbers of the pre- and post-images. It can be seen clearly that the lowest digital numbers
decrease with the increase of spectral wavelength since the effect of Rayleigh scattering decreases as the
electromagnetic wavelength increases. The DOS-processed images were then used in subsequent analyses
for each of the four change detection methods.
3.2. Post-classification comparison
This method of LULC change detection involves two major steps–(1) independently classifying
multi-date images, and (2) comparing the LULC class memberships of the corresponding pixels in the
multi-date images. Pixel pairs with different class labels in multi-date images are identified as change pixels.
The accuracy of LULC classification depends on several inter-related factors including the number and
types of image features used for classification, the desired level of classification, and the level of
sophistication of the classification algorithm. If higher levels of LULC classification are desired, for
example Anderson Level-II and Level-III LULC classes (Anderson et al., 1976), more bands of images and
a more sophisticated classification algorithm may be required. However, limited by the number of available
spectral bands of satellite images, the classification accuracy generally decreases with the increase of the
desired level of LULC classes. In this study, only three major LULC classes–vegetation, water body and
barren land, are specified in order to achieve high classification accuracy for each of the multi-date images.
The maximum likelihood classification was implemented using all of the three spectral bands (green, red
and near infrared) and a set of training data in the pre- and post-images. The confusion matrices of the pre-
and post-images LULC classification are shown in Table 2. Very high overall classification accuracies were
achieved for both the pre- and the post-images. Also, all producer’s and user’s accuracies are high with the
only exception of the user’s accuracy of the barren land class of the pre-image classification. It is worthy to
note that with the three major LULC classes, minor within-class changes, for example changes due to
vegetation growth, soil moisture variation, etc., will likely not be detected.
LULC change detection was then conducted by comparing the class labels of all pixel pairs within the
study area. Table 3 sumarizes the results of LULC change detection. The overall percentage of detected
changes is 11.19%. Changes in the pre-image vegetation cover accounts for approximately 10% of the total
study area. Even though changes in the pre-image water body only accounts for 0.23% of the study area,
however, it accounts for approximately 14.5% [1,462/(1,462+ 8,615)100% = 14.51%] of the pre-image
water body. Figure 3 demonstrates the results of change detection using the post-classification comparison
method.
3.3. Image differencing using NDVI
The image differencing method is a technique whereby changes in brightness values between two or
more data sets are determined by pixel-by-pixel subtraction of coregistered image data sets. The subtraction
(differencing) produces an image data set where positive and negative values represent areas of change and
values close to zero indicate areas that remain relatively unchanged (Muchoney and Haack, 1994).
Threshold values are often defined and used to indicate whether significant or relevant change has occurred.
In a change detection practice using image differencing method, the first step is to determine the feature
images from which the difference image is derived. The feature images are a pair of pre- and post-images
with their digital numbers reflective of LULC changes. They can be the raw satellite images or transformed
images, for example NDVI or principal component images. The choice of the feature images should
consider not only their capability of reflecting changes but also the probability distribution of the resultant
difference image, if the threshold is to have a sound, statistical basis. Digital numbers in the difference
image are often considered to be normally distributed with a zero mean and some value of standard
5Meanwhile, a few important concerns must be addressed before the work of change detection can be
placed in the framework of hypothesis test. Firstly, parameters (mean and covariance matrix) of the BVN
distribution must be estimated using data of no-change pixel pairs only. This is due to the null hypothesis of
no change occurrence. Secondly, the bivariate joint distribution may vary with LULC classes. For example,
water body and vegetation canopy have quite different spectral reflectances, and as a result, the BVN
distributions of the two classes are different. Therefore, for a given level of significance, the corresponding
probability contour must be constructed for each LULC class.
In this study, we consider the BVN distribution of the pre- and post-NDVI images for change detection
using the bivariate joint distribution method. The first step of this approach is to select a group of no-change
pixel pairs for each LULC class. This can be achieved by using the change detection results of the post-
classification comparison method. No-change pixel pairs for each of the three LULC classes were identified
and formed the basis for estimation ofandin Eq. (4) for each LULC class. Since the post-classification
comparison method involves only three major LULC classes and yields very high overall accuracies, the
identified no-change pixels can be considered to be very reliable. Using the estimated values ofandof
each LULC class, )%1(100  probability contour can then be constructed for each of the three LULC
classes. For any pixel pair in the study area, we first check its pre-image class identity based on the results
of LULC classification, and then the )%1(100  probability contour of that class is used for change
detection of the pixel pair. The results of change detection using the NDVI bivariate joint distribution
method are shown in Figure 4(b).
3.5. Conditional distribution method
At a given level of significance, the bivariate joint distribution method establishes the class-specific
)%1(100  probability contours using all no-change pixel pairs of the corresponding LULC classes.
However, given the digital number in the pre-image, the digital number in the post-image is likely to be
restricted to fall within a smaller range, if no change has occurred. As illustrated in Figure 6, if a no-change
pixel pair has its pre-image digital number equals x1, then; its post-image digital number is more likely to
fall closer to b, and very unlikely to be close to the value a. Knowing the pre-image digital number provides
us an additional information for making decision on change detection. To take the advantage of knowing the
pre-image digital number, we therefore propose to use the conditional distribution of the post-image digital
number for change detection.
Assuming a BVN distribution for digital numbers of a no-change pixel pair, the conditional distribution
of the post-image digital number (X2), given the pre-image digital number (X1 = x1), can be expressed as

) are LULC class-dependent and must be estimated using only the no-change pixel pairs of individual
LULC classes.
The conditional distribution of the post-image digital number is also a normal distribution with mean

In the above inequalities, the choice of k is dependent on the desired level of significance. Forvalues
7detection achieved by the post-classification comparison method also cannot be evaluated with the level of
significance since the decision on change detection does not consider the probability distribution of digital
numbers of the involved images and no threshold or critical regions are required. However, the method of
post-classification comparison yields better change detection accuracy than the image differencing method.
Placing the work of change detection in the framework of hypothesis test has the advantage that the
uncertainties involved in change detection can be quantitatively evaluated through different levels of
significance, as have been demonstrated by the bivariate joint distribution method and the conditional
distribution method. This is achieved by using only the class-dependent, no-change pixel pairs, which can
be identified by conducting LULC classification prior to the change detection, to establish critical regions
for different LULC classes. The results of LULC change detection in this study suggest that a prior LULC
classification can help to achieve independent change detection for individual LULC classes and the class-
dependent change detection is crucial for accurate LULC change detection.
5. Conclusions
Two hypothesis-test-based LULC change detection methods, namely the bivariate joint distribution and
the conditional distribution methods, are proposed and compared with the post-classification comparison
method and the image differencing method. Based on the change detection results in a study area in central
Taiwan, the two proposed methods are significantly superior to the other two methods in terms of the
overall change detection accuracy, with the conditional distribution method having the highest accuracies.
Unlike the other three methods, the post-classification comparison method does not require a threshold for
change detection. The threshold value of the image differencing method is determined using digital numbers
of all pixels in the difference image, and therefore, its change detection accuracy cannot be evaluated with a
level of significance. In contrast, the bivariate joint distribution method and the conditional distribution
method are hypothesis-test based, with LULC-class-dependent critical regions which are associated with
desired levels of significance. Both the bivariate joint distribution method and the conditional distribution
method consider the correlation between digital numbers of no-change pixels in the pre- and post-images,
and therefore, the effect of sun-target-sensor geometry and atmospheric transmittance on radiances of multi-
date images is implicitly accounted for. The conditional distribution method further considers the effect of
the known pre-image digital number on the variation range of the post-image digital number and yields
slightly better change detection accuracies. A prior LULC classification can help to achieve independent
change detection for individual LULC classes and the class-dependent change detection is crucial for
accurate LULC change detection.
