Abstract— In this paper, we propose a neighbor-aware dynamic
backoff scheme and evaluate the performance of the proposed
scheme for ad hoc networks. The backoff scheme that we devised
grants node access to the channel, according to the competing
number of nodes for a transmitted frame. We use both an
analytical model and simulation experiments to evaluate the
dynamic performance of our backoff mechanism in an ad hoc
network.
Keywords: backoff; ad hoc networks; neighbor-aware.
I. INTRODUCTION
There has been a growing interest in mobile wireless
networks in recent years. Such networks are formed by mobile
hosts (or nodes, users) that do not have direct links to all other
hosts. They can be rapidly deployed without any established
infrastructure or centralized administration; in this situation,
they are called ad hoc networks [1]. Because of the greater
affordability of commercial radios, ad hoc networks are likely
to play an important role in computer communications. The
applications of ad hoc network are in building, campus,
battlefield or rescue environments.
Unlike wired networks, problems such as: mobility of
nodes, shared broadcast channel, hidden and exposed terminal
problem, and constraints on resources, such as bandwidth and
battery power, limit the applications of ad hoc networks. Due
to the above mentioned factors, providing energy aware, packet
delivery ratio, and end-to-end goodput guarantees in ad hoc
networks are some tough propositions.
Packet scheduling in the Medium Access Control (MAC)
layer is for choosing the next packet to transmit, such that a
real attempt is made to satisfy the end-to-end delay and packet
delivery ratio guarantees. Wireless scheduling algorithms sig-
nificantly differ from their corresponding wired network. In a
wired network, when a node has data packets for transmission,
it cares only for the packets in its own transmission queue.
But in ad hoc networks, the channel is broadcast; multiple
nodes may contend for the channel simultaneously, resulting
in collisions. To avoid the collision problem, a node must be
aware of traffic at nodes in its two-hop contention area [2].
Therefore, an efficient contention window control algorithm is
an important issue for packet scheduling in ad hoc networks.
Recently, the renewed interests in ad hoc networks have
centered on using the IEEE 802.11 MAC mechanism. In
[3], the authors raised the question: Can the IEEE 802.11
work well in wireless ad hoc networks? They concluded
that the protocol was not designed for multihop networks.
Although IEEE 802.11 MAC can support some ad hoc network
architecture, it is not intended to support the wireless multihop
mobile ad hoc networks, in which connectivity is one of the
most prominent features.
The performance of IEEE 802.11 MAC mechanism is
determined by contention window control scheme, RTS/CTS
mechanism, transmission range, etc. In addition, whether or
not the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol is efficient will affect
the performance of ad hoc networks. The metrics for the
performance of 802.11 ad hoc networks may have throughput,
delay, jitter, energy dissipation, etc.
A simulation analysis of the contention window control
mechanism in the IEEE 802.11 standard has been presented
in [4]. Since the backoff and contention window are closely
related, the selection of the contention window will affect the
network throughput. The authors in [4] showed the effective
throughput and the mean packet delay versus offered load for
different values of the contention window parameter and the
number of contending stations.
The throughput and the mean frame delay, as functions of
offered load for different RTS threshold values and numbers
of stations transmitting frames of random sizes, are presented
in [5]. When the number of stations increases, the RTS
threshold should be decrease. While transmitting frames of
random sizes, it is recommended to always set the RTS/CTS
mechanism independent of the number of contending stations.
The absence of a RTS/CTS mechanism entails considerable
network performance degradation, especially for large values
of offered load and numbers of contending stations.
The influence of packet size on the network throughput has
been discussed in [6]. When the load is fixed and the packet
size is increased, the contending numbers will be decreased
and the network performance will be degraded. If the hidden
terminal problem occurs, the performance worsens. When the
network load is not heavy, the network performance varies
slightly as the packet size changes. When the network load is
heavy, the hidden terminal problem worsens and the network
performance is lowered for the longer packet size.
Under a wide set of network and load conditions, multi-hop
networks have lower performance than do single hop networks
[7]. Data throughput is maximized when all nodes are in range
of each other. The performance degradation in networks may
be explained by the fact that channel contention in mobile ad
hoc networks based on the 802.11 standard is not ideal.
In [8], the author proposed a Markov Chain to model the
IEEE 802.11 DCF. This Markov chain model analysis applies
to both packet transmission schemes employed by DCF; for
the model, the author proposed an extensive throughput perfor-
mance evaluation of basic and RTS/CTS access mechanisms.
In [9], the author proposed an enhanced distributed channel
access (EDCA) mechanism under saturation condition and
analyzed the throughput and delay performance of EDCA.
An effective backoff algorithm is proposed in [10] and
the authors model it with a Markov chain; propose a hybrid
collision resolution method to increase both the throughput
and fairness performances of the DCF for the wireless access
medium. But the simulation environment is completed in a
single-hop BSS, this is not suitable for wireless multihop ad
hoc networks.
In this paper, we present the results of a simulation study
that characterizes the energy dissipation, packet delivery ratio,
and throughput of ad hoc networks. In particular, we use the
CBR connection numbers as the main varying parameters for
the above mentioned performance metrics. If the contention
window control scheme does not consider the competing

size scheme
B. Analytical model
In this paper, Markov Chain is used to model the backoff
operation of each station. Our scheme is similar to that
of [8]. Let b(t) be the stochastic process representing the
backoff time counter for a given station. Let m be the
maximum backoff stage. Let s(t) be the stochastic process
representing the backoff stage (0, . . . ,m) of the station at
time t. Let us adopt the notation CWmin = X ∗ N and
Wi = CWmin ∗ (i + 1), where i ∈ (0,m) is called ”backoff
stage.”. Thus, the process {s(t), b(t)} of our neighbor-aware
dynamic backoff scheme is a Markov chain. Fig. 1 shows
the Markov chain model with the state transition graph for
tracking the status of every station at every slot time. Let
m,”maximum backoff stage,” be the value such that
D = (X ∗N ∗ (i+ 1)− 1)− (X ∗N ∗ (i)− 1) = X ∗N, i ∈ (0,m)
where i ∈ (0,m) is called ”backoff stage.”
1) Packet transmission probability: As in [8], the key
approximation in this model is that at each transmission
attempt and regardless of the number of retransmissions
suffered, each packet collides with an independent probability
p. In Fig. 1, we adopt the short notation used in [8].
P{i1, k1} = P{s(t+ 1) = i1, b(t+ 1) = k1|s(t) = i0, b(t) =
k0}. In this Markov chain, the only non null one-step
transition probabilities are:

P{i, k|i, k + 1} = 1 k ∈ (Wi−1,Wi − 2), i ∈ (0,m)
P{i, k|i− 1, 0} = p/D k ∈ (Wi−1,Wi − 1), i ∈ (1,m)
P{i− 1, k|i, 0} = (1− p)/D k ∈ (Wi−1,Wi − 1), i ∈ (1,m)
P{i, k|i, 0} = (1− p)/D i = 0,m
Let bi,k, i ∈ (0,m), k ∈ (Wi−1,Wi − 1) be the stationary
distribution of the Markov chain. Let τ be the probability
that a station transmits in a randomly chosen slot time. Let µ
be p1−p . First, note that
p · bi−1,0 = (1− p) · bi,0; i ∈ (0,m)
bi,0 =
p
1−p · bi−1,0
bi,0 = (
p
1−p )
ib0,0 = µib0,0
bm,0 = (
p
1−p )
mb0,0 = µmb0,0
Because of the Markov chain regularities, for each
k ∈ (Wi−1,Wi − 1), it is
bi,k =
D − k
D
·
{
(1− p)b0,0 + (1− p)bi+1,0 i = 0
pbi−1,0 + (1− p)bi+1,0 i ∈ (0,m)
pbi−1,0 + pbm,0 i = m
By means of above relating equations, bi,k can be simplified
as
bi,k =
D−k
D
bi,0; i ∈ (0,m), k ∈ (Wi−1,Wi − 1)
From above equations, all the values bi,k are expressed
as functions of the value b0,0 and the conditional collision
probability p. Then, b0,0 can finally be determined by
imposing the normalization condition, simplified as follows:
1 =
∑m
i=0
∑D−1
k=1
bi,k =
b0,0
2
∑m
i=0
( p
1−p )
i(D + 1)
from which
b0,0 =
2∑m
i=0
(
p
1−p )i(D+1)
Then
b0,0 =
2∑m
i=0
(
p
1−p )i(X∗N+1)
Now the probability τ can be expressed as:
τ =
∑m
i=0
bi,0 =
1−µm+1
1−µ b0,0 =
(1−p)(1−( p1−p )m+1)
1−2p · b0,0
In the stationary state, each station transmits a packet with
probability τ . So, we get:
p = 1− (1− τ)n−1
2) Throughput: Let Ptr be the probability that there is at
least one transmission in the considered slot time. And let Ps
be the probability that a transmission is successful, given the
probability Ptr. Therefore, we get:
ptr = 1− (1− τ)n
ps =
nτ(1−τ)n−1
ptr
=
nτ(1−τ)n−1
1−(1−τ)n
Now we are able to express the normalized system
throughput S as the ratio
S =
E[payload information transmitted in a slot time]
E[length of a slot time]
=
PsPtrE[P ]
(1−Ptr)σ+PtrPsTrtss +Ptr(1−Ps)Trtsc
Let T rtss and T
rts
c be the average time the channel is
sensed busy because of a successful transmission or a
In [10], the author shown dynamic coefficient of contention
window versus number of neighbors for a BSS. We use X
versus N dynamic coefficient in [10] for ad hoc network and
name C802.11. Fig. 3 shows the new dynamic coefficient of
contention window versus number of neighbors for ad hoc
networks for modified C802.11 (mC802.11) and D802.11. As
in [10], the calculations for the dynamic coefficient X needs
lots of computation power. To facilitate the implementation of
the proposed method, the results for the dynamic coefficient
can be built in each node for wireless multihop ad hoc network.
We can see from Fig. 3, the dynamic coefficient equals 25
when the number of users is in the range of 1 ∼ 3, and
converges to 18 when the number of users is greater than
17. Although the coefficient has different values, maintaining
such information in each node for wireless multihop ad hoc
network is possible. With the information, each node in ad
hoc network can determine suitable contention window size.
This is really similar to maintain different contention window
sizes for all collision stages.

A. Packet delivery ratio
Fig. 4 shows the packet delivery ratio versus the number
of connections 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 CBR connections for
802.11, C802.11, mC802.11 and D802.11 From Fig. 4, we see
that the packet delivery ratio is about 1 when the traffic load is
light (5 CBR connections). When the traffic load is moderate
to high (10 to 30 CBR connections), the packet delivery ratio
becomes lower. In the case that the packet delivery ratio is
lower than 1, some packets are queued or discarded somewhere
in the network. We further looked into the detailed operations
and found that packets are lost at the intermediate (or relay)
nodes but not at the sources.
Higher loading at the radio/MAC layer increases the prob-
ability of frame collision and decreases the network perfor-
mance. From Fig. 4,we know that the packet delivery ratio for
D802.11 is much higher than that for 802.11, C802.11 and
mC802.11.

the end-to-end goodput for D802.11 is much higher than that
of 802.11, C802.11 and mC802.11. In Fig. 5, as the number
of CBR connections increases, the end-to-end goodput also
increases. When the number of connections is large, the end-
to-end goodput increases. In addition, given a particular CBR
connection number, the goodput for D802.11 is still higher
than 802.11, C802.11 and mC802.11.
