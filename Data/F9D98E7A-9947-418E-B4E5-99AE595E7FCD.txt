the authors’ opinions, there are two reasons that limit 
the use of the Trefftz method. The first reason is that 
the system of linear equations which result from the 
Trefftz method is an ill-posed system, even for a 
well-posed boundary value problem. As mentioned by 
[19], when the number of functions in the Trefftz 
method increases, the condition number of the resulting 
dense unsymmetric matrix increases very fast. Yeih et 
al. [14] have discussed the ill-posed nature of the 
Trefftz method, and they suggested to deal with it by 
using the Tikhonov’s regularization method and 
L-curve concept. Liu [20, 21] later proposed a bound-
ary-collocation Trefftz method to deal with the 
ill-posed behavior, in which a characteristic length is 
adopted, to scale the basis functions, hereafter referred 
to as the “modified” Trefftz method. Later, Liu [22] 
extended this method to deal with the potential prob-
lem in a 2-D doubly connected domain. Liu [23, 24] 
also applied this modified boundary-collocation Trefftz 
method to solve the inverse Cauchy problem, and 
found that this method did not require any regulariza-
tion technique. Liu [25] applied the “characteris-
tic-length-scale” or “modified” Trefftz method to solve 
the biharmonic equation. Since the “modified” colloca-
tion Trefftz method has successfully resolved the 
ill-posed nature of the problem, Liu et al. [26] used the 
resulting matrix of this method to propose a general 
purpose conditioner which can tackle with the ill-posed 
behaviors of various systems of linear algebraic equa-
tions. The second reason for the lack of popularity of 
the Trefftz method is that, for the multiply connected 
domains with genus p (p>1), the conventional Trefftz 
method (T-Trefftz method) fails. To deal with arbitrary 
shapes in a 2-D domain, especially for multiply con-
nected domain with genus p (p>1), in the T-Trefftz 
method, one needs to decompose the problem domain 
into several simply connected subdomains and use the 
Trefftz method in each one. On the real boundary, the 
Trefftz method requires the approximate solution to 
satisfy the boundary conditions at each collocation 
point. On the artificial boundary (for dividing the do-
main into subdomains), the continuity conditions are 
used to connect the adjacent subdomains. Although this 
method may successfully resolve the difficulty when 
facing the multiply connected domain with genus p 
(p>1), the artificial boundaries introduced in this 
method, to satisfy the interfacial infinitely conditions, 
are not unique and depend on the users’ preference. In 
addition, many extra collocation points on the artificial 
boundary introduce additional unknowns that are gen-
erally not good for the numerical method. Due to these 
two reasons, the Trefftz method is less popular. In this 
paper, we seek to remedy this situation. 
In this paper, we propose a “modified” multi-
ple-source-point boundary-collocation Trefftz method 
to deal with the Laplace equation. In presently pro-
posed method, we first relax the constraint of the 
T-Trefftz method, and allow many source points in the 
system. For each source point, we will discuss how to 
construct a basis function set. Then, we adopt the 
“characteristic length” concept to reduce the ill-posed 
behavior for the Trefftz method. Beside this Introduc-
tion section, this article contains the following sections. 
In section 2, we discuss how to use multiple source 
points, and how to arrange the basis functions. In sec-
tion 3, we introduce the concept of a characteristic 
length. In section 4, we use six examples to show the 
validity of the proposed method. In the final section, 
some concluding remarks are given. 
 
3. Trefftz method: source points and basis functions 
Consider a two-dimensional domain  enclosed by a 
boundary , and the physical quantity u satisfies the 
Laplace equation: 
 2 0u x  for x , (1) 
  Du f x (Dirichelet boundary condition) (2)

2 2,  0,  n Ru u h       x  (Robin boundary 
condition) (4) 
where n denotes the outward normal direction, D de-
notes the boundary where the Dirichelet boundary con-
dition is given, N denotes the boundary where the 
Neumann boundary condition is given, and R denotes 
the boundary where the Robin boundary condition is 
given. 
On each boundary point, if only one type of a 
boundary condition is given it is referred to, in this 
paper, as the direct boundary value problem. If on a 
part of boundary, one is given both the Dirichelet data 
and Neumann data, but has no information on some 
other part of the boundary, it is referred to as the in-
verse Cauchy problem. It is known that the direct 
boundary value problem is well-posed, while the in-
verse Cauchy problem is ill-posed. 
The conventional Trefftz method (T-Trefftz method) 
begins with the so-called T-complete functions. For a 
simply connected domain illustrated in Fig. 1(a), one 
usually locates the source point inside the domain, and 
the T-complete basis functions are chosen to be 
    1, cos , sin , , sin , cos ,k kr r r k r k     ,  
where andr  are the polar coordinate centered at the 
source-point, as shown in Fig. 1(a). 
For an infinite domain with a cavity as illustrated in 
Fig. 1(b), one usually locates the source point inside 
the cavity, and the T-complete functions include 
    1 1ln , cos , sin , , sin , cos , .k kr r r r k r k       
For a doubly connected domain (the multiply con-
nected domain with genus 1) as shown in Fig. 1(c), the 
source point is located inside the cavity, and the 
T-complete functions include 
    1 11, ln , cos , sin , , sin , cos , .k kr r r r k r k       
For a multiply connected domain with genus p (p>1) as 
shown in Fig. 1(d), one needs to divide the domain into 
several simply connected domains, and apply the 
T-Trefftz method in each subdomain. However, as 
mentioned earlier, the introduction of an artificial 
boundary increases the number of unknowns and there 
is no unique way to introduce the imaginary boundaries. 
It is thus natural for one to ask, if there is simpler way 
to deal with the problem defined in a multiply con-
nected domain.

Now we consider a two-dimensional multiply con-
nected domain with genus p. The multiple-source-point 
Trefftz method uses the following T-complete set: 
the solution as: 1 sin A
Ar
  where rA and A are meas-
ured from the point A which is a point (0.5,0) in the 
Cartesian coordinate system. Now we place only one 
source point at B which is (-0.6,0) inside the cavity and 
the basis functions are:  
    sin , cos , lnm mi i i ir m r m   ir  for the source 
points inside the cavity or outside the domain of inter-
est, where in the subscript i denotes the i-th source 
points. The positive power basis functions can be ar-
ranged at only one source point, say P (P can coincide 
with one of the previous selected source points inside 
the cavity). The basis functions are: 
  1 11, ln , cos , sin , , sin ,kB B B B B B Br r r r k      
  cos , ,kB Br k  where rB and B are measuring 
from the point B. Now, using Eq. (9) we know that for 
R> rB where R is the distance between points A and B, 
we can use positive power basis functions to represent 
the solution. However, for R< rB one then needs nega-
tive power basis functions to represent the solution. We 
recall that, in the Trefftz method, the undetermined 
coefficients must be some constants, and cannot be 
functions of spatial variables. It then can be concluded 
that for a multiply connected domain with genus p 
(p>1), we cannot represent all possible solutions if only 
one source point is used. Following this, we also can 
have a very important conclusion that inside each cav-
ity at least one source point is required.  
    1, sin , cos .m mP P P Pr m r m  Therefore, for the 
indirect Trefftz formulation one can say the solution is 
written as the linear combination of these basis func-
tions as: 
   
   

 (10) 
Also, when we observe Eqs. (7)-(9), we can find that 
for different source points the negative power basis 
functions and logarithm basis functions are linearly 
independent. If we want to represent one such basis 
function of source point A, using basis functions de-
veloped from source point B, we may require infinitely 
many basis functions from source point B which is 
definitely not possible for numerical calculation, be-
cause at each source point we can only set up finitely 
many basis functions.

when an infinite region is considered. 
From the abovementioned reasons, one can conclude 
that if we allow ourselves to have many source points, 
and locate at least one source point inside each cavity 
then we can handle the multiply connected domains 
with genus p (p>1), without using the domain decom-
position as suggested by the previous researches. To 
summarize the above discussion, we propose the gen-
eralized multiple-source-point Trefftz method: for each 
cavity, at least one source point should be placed, and 
the negative power and logarithmic basis functions are 
chosen for each point; and the positive power basis 
functions can be chosen for only one source point when 
considering a finite region (one can pick any one 
source point located in the cavity or just pick one point 
inside the domain). This generalized multi-
ple-source-point Trefftz method is the most general one 
developed so far, because the T-Trefftz and F-Trefftz 
methods can be treated as the special cases of the 
presently proposed generalized multiple-source-point 
Trefftz method. Although now we have resolved the 
difficulty of treating a multiply connected domain with 
genus p (p>1) by the concept of multiple-source-point 
Trefftz method, the ill-posed behavior still needs to be 
treated. In the following, the concept of characteristic 
length developed by Liu will be adopted, and the “gen-
eralized” multiple-source-point collocation Trefftz 
method, along with a characteristic length, will be in-
troduced. 
Liu has developed a collocation Trefftz method, in-
volving a characteristic length, in order to make the 
resulting leading coefficient matrix well-posed. He 
proposed to use the characteristic lengths to the terms 
such as ( ) mr  , by a characteristic length R, to lead to 
mr
R
    , such that they will tend to zero for large m. 
For positive power basis functions, the choice of R 
should be larger than the maximum distance between 
any domain point and source point. On the other hand 
for negative power basis functions, the choice of R 
should be less than the minimum distance between any 
domain point and the source point. To adopt this idea, 
Eqs. (10) and (11) can be rewritten as

method of fundamental solutions (F-Trefftz method) 
become special cases of the present method. Owing to 
the concept of a characteristic length, the ill-posed be-
haviors can be overcome, such that one can deal 
well-posed BVP, as well as ill-posed Cauchy BVP, un-
der the present unified method. Numerical examples 
show that the proposed method can deal with BVPs of 
a multiply connected domain with genus p (p>1).
