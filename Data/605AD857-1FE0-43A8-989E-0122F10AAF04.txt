2feasibility of breath-hold BOLD MRI,
we conducted a similar study at a 3-T
clinical scanner (15). The results showed
that there were significant BOLD signal
increases in the gray matter for a
breath-hold period as short as 5 seconds
at 3 T, instead of the 10-second
breath-hold period at 1.5 T. The
fractional activated volume reached a
plateau of 49.54 ± 7.26% at 15 seconds
on a 3-T scanner (15), which was higher
and earlier than the plateau defined for
1.5 T (30.82 ± 4.77% at 20 seconds).
The maximum signal changes were
significantly larger in the 3-T study,
with an average of 69% increase as
compared with those in the 1.5-T study.
Consequently, BOLD MRI at 3 T is
more sensitive for detecting breath-hold
regulated signal changes than previously
described 1.5-T method. The 3-T
technique allows a shorter breath-hold
paradigm feasible for clinical
application in patients with cerebral
diseases.
研究目的:
The present study was aimed to
evaluate the cerebrovascular response
under repeated breath-hold challenges in
normal elderly adults and patients with
ischemic stroke by using 3-T BOLD
MRI. The major goals of the present
study are to evaluate the differential
cerebrovascular response under repeated
breath-hold challenges between elderly
controls and young controls in a
previous study, and to evaluate the
difference in cerebrovacsular response
between normal elderly adults and
patients with ischemic stroke.
研究方法:
Nineteen healthy adults (11 women,
8 men) aged between 50 and 77 years
old (62.5 ± 8.5 years old) were recruited
for this study. The body mass index
(BMI) was in the range from 20 to 28
(23 ± 2). There was no hypertension,
diabetes, cerebrovascular disease,
cardiovascular disease, neurological
disorder, or other major medical
problems in these subjects. The
breath-hold paradigm comprised of one
preparation stage (30-second natural
breathing) and three one-minute periodic
breath-hold cycles (5, 10, 15, 20, or
30-second breath-hold periods). A total
of 70 dynamic measurements were
obtained. A single-shot T2*-weighted
gradient-echo EPI sequence was applied
for BOLD MRI: TR/TE = 3000/35 msec,
flip angle = 90°, slice thickness = 5 mm,
matrix size = 64 x 64, and in-plane
resolution = 3 x 3 mm2. An averaged
signal-time course of subcortical gray
matters (i.e. left thalamus) was used as
the reference function. Pixels with
significant changes in BOLD signal
were then determined using a correlation
analysis at the level of a corrective P
value smaller than 0.05.
There were five patients with
chronic ischemic stroke (2 women and 3
men) aged between 51 and 71 year-old
(mean = 63.2 year-old) in the present
study. The MRI protocols applied in
patients were the same as in normal
group, using a 15-second breath-hold
paradigm.
結果:
End-tidal (ET) CO2, full-width at
half maximum (FWHM), onset time,
maximum signal change and fractional
activation volume under different
breath-hold conditions of normal elderly
were summarized in Table 1.
Table 1
Significant BOLD signal increases
could be detected in the gray matters for
a breath-hold duration as short as 5
4after breath holding for 20–30 seconds
(18). During breath holding after
expiration, significant cerebrovascular
changes secondary to elevated arterial
CO2 tension occur rapidly within 10–20
seconds (18). Therefore, hypercapnia
stress induced by short breath-hold is
expected to be a safe and effective
method for clinical evaluation of
cerebrovascular response. In previous
studies, short periods (15 or 20 seconds)
of breath holding after expiration were
well tolerated by the normal volunteers
and patients. All the participants
reported that it was easy to perform the
breath-holding paradigms, and no
discomfort was complained of during or
after the examination.
This study showed that there were
significant BOLD signal increases in
cortical and subcortical gray matters for
a breath-hold period as short as 5
seconds and the fractional activation
volume vs. breath-duration reached a
plateau at 15 seconds. These findings
were similar to the results in a previous
3-Tesla study in young adults (15).
However, almost all the fractional
activation volume (27.34 % ~ 44.42 %)
and the maximum signal change (1.61 %
~ 2.19 %) in the elderly group were
smaller than the corresponding ones in
young adults (34.16 % ~ 51.45 % and
2.47 % ~ 2.78 %, respectively) (15).
In patients with chronic stroke, the
15-second breath-hold BOLD was
feasible in clinical 3-T MR scanner, as
the results shown in Table 2. From the
preliminary results, lower maximal
signal changes and smaller activation
volumes in stroke patients than in
normal elderly were demonstrated. It
may be due to less amount of normal
gray matter due to ischemic insults to
brain parenchyma, inadequate
cerebrovascular response of damaged
brain tissue, or sub-optimal performance
of breath-holding task (shown as large
variation of breath-hold BOLD data).
Donahue et al (19), using VASO
technique, showed that there was a more
negative VASO reactivity in five elderly
controls (-1.9 %) compared to five
young controls (-1.4 %), but lack of
statistical significance. Since BOLD and
VASO signal changes are derived from
different physiological phenomena, a
large-cohort study combing these two
MRI techniques may further elucidate
the differential cerebrovascular response
to breath holding between elderly and
young adults. Because the number of
stroke patient was rather small in the
present study, these preliminary results
need to be solidified by a larger cohort
study.
結果自評:
    The normal group study was
completed and the results were
presented in part during the 19th annual
meeting of International Society of
Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, which
was held in Montreal, Canada, during
May 7th – 13th, 2011. (Program No.
4044: Breath-Hold Regulated Blood
Oxygenation Level-Dependent MRI of
Elderly Adults)
This study confirmed the feasibility
of breath-hold BOLD MRI in evaluation
of cerebrovascular response to
hypercapnia stress in normal elderly and
also in patients with chronic stroke.
Concerning the study of patient group,
however, the results were convincing
but preliminary, mainly due to a very
limited number of subjects. Actually, it
was difficult to recruit patients with
stroke who would like to and could
follow the breath-holding paradigm well
in the MR scanner. A multi-year, large-
cohort study is necessary for more
meaningful statistical results and also to
follow the changes in cerebrovascular
response to hypercapnia challenges after
brain ischemia.
