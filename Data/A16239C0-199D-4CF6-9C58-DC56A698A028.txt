this project, besides the design and analysis for the 
general complex coupled network system 
synchronization problem, we aimed to construct a 
coupled electrical-fireflies system in order to 
modify the proposed synchronization method. In the 
second year, we developed the fuzzy-based design 
method for the synchronization of coupled gene 
networks. In the third year, we extend the 
synchronization design to discrete- time gene 
networks. Besides, we investigate the ability of 
synchronization for gene networks connected in 
various topologies, where some observations are 
concluded.

人類細胞內的基因有數以萬個，不同
的 基 因 有 不 同 的 基 因 表 達 (gene 
expressions)，但是每一條的基因功能並不
是獨立存在的，各個基因其實是互相影響
並且有關聯的，各個基因相互的關聯就形
成了一個基因調控網路。利用基因網絡，
我們可以更了解生命的運作方式與各種疾
病的發生原因與治療方法，甚至更能搶先
一步預防癌症與遺傳性疾病的發生。根據
基因網絡之間的相互調控資料，系統生物
學家可以建構出基因網絡的數學模型，進
而利用系統學與控制理論去達到我們所需

學模型研究經由耦合連結的方式讓各個原
本獨立的基因網路可以達到同樣的基因表
達，也就是同步化各個基因網路，進而達
到我們所需要的生物目的。 
 
三、 研究方法及成果 
1. Coupled Gene Network Model 
First, we want to formulate coupled gene 
network models as differential equations. Two 
main modeling approaches, general mass action 
(GMA) model or an S-system, are often used for 
biochemical systems. Here, we choose the latter 
to derive the coupled gene model. Generally, the 
gene network S-system is of the form (see [1]) 
as follows:

where q=1,2,...,n, and x1,…,xn+m are the 
metabolites, such as genes, mRNA or proteins in 
gene regulatory networks. Here x1,…,xn denote 
dependent variables and xn+1,…,xn+m are 
independent variables. 
 
Problem Formulation 
Note that gene networks may be unstable and 
deviate from its original functional objective. 
We therefore must design feasible pathways for 
the regulation of gene networks [2]. The 
compensated gene networks are as follows:

where q=1,2,…,n; k1q and k2q are constant 
factors of gene circuit to be designed. The 
factors k1r and k2r are values only existent if gene 
circuits are attached to the input and the output 
of gene xr. Otherwise, the values of k1q and k2q 
are zero for q≠r. 
  We now consider coupled gene networks. 
Assume the coupled network composes of N 
independent nonlinear gene networks. The N 
independent nonlinear gene networks are each 
expressed as follows: 
       tXKgtXftX iii             (2) 
where Xi(t)=(x1,…,xn)i. If there exist appropriate 
cij between each node, then the coupled systems 
are synchronous. Given a real matrix C = (cij)N× N, 
if the sum of all elements in each row is equal to 
zero, the matrix C is then called a coupling 
configuration matrix. This matrix denotes the 
topology and coupling structure of the network. 
The structure topology, denoted by cij , indicates 
a connection from node Xi to node Xj . In other 
words, if there is no connection between node Xi 
and Xj , then cij = 0. When N independent nodes 
in (2) are coupled with each other, the coupled

2.2 Synchronization of Coupled Stable-Unstable 
Gene Network 
According to [5], we introduce the concept 
coupling systems with different stability 
characteristics. Using a practical example, as 
shown in Fig. 1, we illustrate a real cockroach 
influenced by a synthetic cockroach but not vice 
versa. We can therefore design the synthetic 
cockroach to achieve the control objective. In 
light of the above example, we now consider a 
stable gene network coupled with unstable gene 
networks. The objective is faulty genes, e.g., 
mathematically implying genes with unsuitable 
initial values, can be regulated by normal genes 
in coupled gene network (illustrated in Fig.2). 
We assign i = 1 for the stable gene network, i.e., 
the gene network with index 1. Since our goal is 
for the stable gene network to synchronize the 
unstable ones, we consider the configuration 
matrix C with elements c11 = c12 = …= c1N= 0. 
According to (10), the overall error system is 
rewritten as follows:

where C  is the output matrix. If we discuss the 
effect of disturbance zW on the whole coupled

3. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS 
A. Continuous-Time Case : 
As an example, we will illustrate the 
simulation of synchronization design for a 
coupled system composed of two-step and 
two-feedback cascaded gene networks, 
considered in [6] and [2], shown in Fig. 3. 
According to the GMA model, we can obtain the 
state equations [6], [2] as follows: 
0.5 0.5 1 0.5
1 1 1 2 1
0.5 1 0.5

              (21)
 
It can be known that the gene network (21) is 
unstable according to [2]. In order to stabilize 
the gene network at the equilibrium point xe= [1, 
1,1,1], two feedback gene circuits with 
parameters k1 and k2 from genes x2 and x3 to the 
input and the output of gene x1 can be added [2]. 
Then, the gene network (21) can be rewritten as 
follows: 
0.5 1.5 0.5 1 0.5 0.5
1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 3
0.5 1 0.5

   (22) 
Now, we transform (21) from the GMA model 
into the S-system along the steady state at the 
equilibrium point xe= [1, 1,1,1], arriving at the 
following equations:

4. Synchronization Performance Analysis of 
Gene Coupled Networks 
  As a matter of fact, most researchers [9]-[11] 
in the literature discuss the characteristic of the 
entire coupled networks rather than the inner 
specific connections, such as the placement of 
the nodes and connections. Also, the importance 
of a single node to synchronize the whole 
network was rarely discussed. Therefore, we 
will focus on the placement of the stable node in 
a coupled network using the results from Section 
3. In accordance with Theorem 1, we can obtain 
suitable inner coupled constant matrix H . Then, 
the influence on the synchronization of coupled 
networks by selecting different stable node is 
discussed in this section. 
First of all, we try to derive a general index to 
indicate the synchronization ability according to 
the following observations: (1) The longer the 
path length is, the smaller the affection of the 
node to the other nodes will be; (2) The higher 
the degree is, the bigger the affection of the node 
to the other nodes will be. Moreover, in our 
experience, clustering coefficient is not an 
apparent fact when discussing the node to node 
affections in networks. Hence, degree and 
shortest path length are the two important factors 
in node affection. 
We consider the gene coupled network is 
constituted by a stable gene network 
accompanied with other unstable gene networks. 
The synchronization is closely related to the 
edge number of the networks. Furthermore, the 
effect of the edges directly connected to the 
stable node is more significant than other edges. 
In light of this, we will define the term, namely 
an effective edge number, to emphasize the 
edges directly connected to the stable node. 
Definition 1 : For an interested node i , we 
define its effective edge number ( iEdg ) as 
1
( -1)
i
i s i
s
Edg

  

         (26) 
where i  is the number of edges that are 
directly connected to node i ; s  is the 
number of edges that connect node s  to other 
nodes; and   denotes the weighting of these 
secondary edges. It is reasonable to have 0 <  < 
1. 
We also observe that the synchronization is 
closely related to the average length of the 
shortest path from the concerned node to other 
nodes. 
Definition 2 : For an interested need i , we 
define its average length of the shortest path as 
follows: 
1,
/ ( 1)
N
i ij
j j i
L p N
 
         (27) 
where N  is the number of overall nodes in the 
network and 
ijp  is the length of the shortest 
path from node i  to other nodes. 
In light of the above definitions, we now 
propose an index to indicate the synchronization 
ability for a network as follows: 
/i i iInd Edg L           (28) 
There are three examples to be given below to 
confirm the feasibility of the proposed index. 
Since gene expression should not get out of a 
normal range, the average maximum overshoot 
of 1ix , where 1,2, ,10,i   will be taken as 
the referred value of the synchronization ability. 
Example 1  We consider nine unstable gene 
networks (21) and one stable gene network (22) 
as shown in Fig 10. If we let 0.2   in the 
effective edge number (27), the index proposed 
in (28) can indicate the correct order of the 
synchronization ability. The details of the 
indexes and simulation results are depicted in 
Table 1.
