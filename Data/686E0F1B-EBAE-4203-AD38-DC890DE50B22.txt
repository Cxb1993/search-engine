1. Introduction
The multi-layer metal thin-films are widely used for the satisfaction of all mechanical,
thermal, and electronic requirements in the development of microelectronics system,
photoelectric equipment and micro sensors. The advancement of ultrashort pulse laser
technologies makes high-rate heating of thin metal films rapidly develop in micromachining,
surface hardening, and other applications. However, ultrafast heating on the thin metal films
possibly induces thermal damage. Perry et al. [1] presented that ultrashort pulses in the
picosecond domain induce thermal damage after the heating pulse is over. Experimental results [2,
3] show that thermal damage induced by a sufficiently high-rate heating does not have an obvious
signature by excessive temperature. These results further imply that thermal damage can occurs
in the cold lattices during ultrafast pulse heating on metal films. It is different with that the
long-pulse laser heating often drives the heated spot to the melting temperature. For the
prevention of thermal damage, the knowledge of ultrafast thermal behavior is demanded.
During the ultrafast heating of thin metal films in the pico/femtosecond domain, the
response time of the film is comparable to the phonon-electron thermalization time. Solid lattice
and electron gas are not in thermal equilibrium. Classical heat conduction models assuming
thermal equilibrium between solid lattice and electron gas lose validity for the prediction of
ultrafast thermal behavior. Therefore, the microscale heat transfer models that describe the
phenomena of energy interchange between electrons and phonons from a microscopic point of
view are proposed for such problems. The parabolic microscopic two-step model has attracted
attention in analysis of micro-scale heat transfer [4-9]. However, as the response time is
comparable or less to the relaxation time, which is the characteristic time for the activation of
ballistic behavior in the electron gas, the hyperbolic nature of heat flux carried by electrons is
revealed. The parabolic two-step model may lose accuracy [10,11]. A reliable microscale heat
transfer model must be able to describe the various microstructural interaction effects. Qiu and
Tien [10] thus derived the hyperbolic two-step model from the Boltzmann transport equation to
account the hyperbolic nature of heat flux for electrons. The hyperbolic microscopic two-step
model is mathematically described with a set of coupled energy equations. This work lends the
theoretical insight to hyperbolic micro-scale heat transfer in multi-layer metal films.
2. Mathematics Model
This work considers that a bi-layer metal thin film is heated with an ultrashort pulse laser.
The thermal behavior in the metal film is modeled as a one-dimensional problem, since the laser
beam diameter is much larger than the heat penetration depth [10, 11]. The laser pulse duration is
shorter than or comparable to the electron relaxation time. As a result, the hot electrons are not in
local thermal equilibrium with the lattice and the hyperbolic energy transport effect on the
electron temperature becomes important. Neglecting the thermal dependence of thermal
properties, energy conservation equations and the heat flux equation for the hyperbolic
microscopic two-step model in layer j are written as [10]

In order to obtain more accurate numerical results, the derivation of the governing algebraic
equations is important. This work plans to derive the governing algebraic equations from Eqs.
(18) and (19). In other words, the selection of the approximation functions of e

obtained from Eq. (12b). The numerical inversion of the Laplace transform [13] can be applied to

values of in and N are assumed as 0.5 and 1, respectively. The constant values in Eq. (10) are
determined as 0Q = 5 and a = 40. Table 1 shows thermal properties of common metals at the
room temperature. This work performs all the computations with the distance between two
neighboring nodes 02.0)( j .

note that all lattice temperature distributions during 50  are in the positive domain, though
some electron temperature distributions are in the negative domain for the difference in the
thermal properties of dissimilar materials and the transmission-reflection phenomenon at the
interface.
To further know the effects of the difference in the thermal properties of dissimilar materials
on the temperature distribution, the second case, N = 0.02, 17.55cR , 362.0)2( eR ,
383.3)2( kR , 78.0)2( lR , 067.0)2( gR , and 33.13)2( tR , is studied in this part. The
numerical results for= 0.2 and 0.8 are presented in Fig. 3. The present results are also in a good
agreement with the analytical solution. As= 0.2, the energy pulse has not reached the interface
yet. Layer 2 does not affect the distributions of electron and lattice temperatures. The
distributions of electron and lattice temperatures shown in Fig. 3 for = 0.2 are the same with
those in Fig. 1 under that layer 1 is the reference layer. As = 0.8, the energy pulse has
encountered the interface and the transmission-reflection phenomenon happens. It is found from
Fig. 3 and the definition ofandthat the displacement of energy pulse in film can be described
with tV. For 362.0)2( eR , 383.3)2( kR , and 33.13)2( tR , the velocity of heat transfer in layer
2 is slower than that in layer 1. Fig. 3(a) shows an upward reflected thermal pulse and the most
energy accumulates in layer 1 for 362.0)2( eR and 78.0)2( lR at= 0.8. As 067.0)2( gR , the
phonon-electron interactions in layer 2 are weaker than that in layer 1. That is why the lattice
temperature in layer 2 is further lower than that in layer 1 at = 0.8. The comparison between
Figs. 1 and 3 further shows the difference in the thermal properties of dissimilar materials can
affect the temperature distribution and the temperature gradient.
5. Conclusions
This work analyzes the microscopic heat transfer in bi-layer metal films with the hyperbolic
two-step model. The mathematical difficulties induced by the hyperbolic nature of heat transfer in
electron gas, the coupled energy equations, and the interfacial boundary conditions are counted.
The are presented for the problems in the double-layer films with an ultrashort laser heating,
which the pulse duration is described with the Dirac delta function. Results show that thermal
pulses travel back and forth in electron gas at a finite propagation speed for the hyperbolic nature
of energy transport. However, the effect of the hyperbolic nature of heat transfer on the lattice
temperature distribution is not obvious. The heat-affected region depends on the propagation
velocity of heat transfer. The difference in the thermal properties of dissimilar materials creates
the transmission-reflection phenomenon of thermal pulse at the interface and affects the
temperature distribution and the temperature gradient in layered films. The thermal pulses in
electron gas fade for superposition of thermal pulses, heat diffusion, and the phonon-electron
interactions.
