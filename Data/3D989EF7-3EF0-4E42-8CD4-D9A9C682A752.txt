Abstract 
The project aims to manufacture 
Ti/AS-4/PEEK nanocompostie laminates 
successfully. To assure the best quality and 
property stability it is better be tested and 
verified. Grade 1 Ti sheets of thickness 0.5mm 
and AS-4/PEEK quasi-isotropic laminate 
0.55mm thick were used. Nano-particles SiO2 
of diameter 15±5nm were dispersed uniformly 
on the APC-2 interfaces. After stacking 5 layers 
the modified diaphragm curing process was 
adopted to make the hybrid panels. The 
specimen was drilled a central hole of 4mm for 
testings. 
As for experimental work, the ultimate 
strength and stiffness were obtained by static 
tensile tests at RT for both notched and 
unnotched samples. It is found the ultimate 
strength of notched specimens drops about 15% 
due to stress concentration effect. However, the 
stiffness is almost unchanged. Next, the 
constant stress amplitude tension-tension cyclic 
tests were conducted to receive the S-N curves 
for centrally notched hybrid specimens. 0.9σult 
is denoted as high load and 0.7σult low load for 
two-step loading spectrum. In both high→low 
and low→high step loadings the first step is to 
do cyclic tests at high life of the corresponding 
load, and then finish it due to last step load. The 
cumulate damage due to two-step loadings was 
treated by suitable damage theories. Miner’s 
rule is the simple and widely used one. The 
predicted results were in good agreement with 
experimental data. The established 
semi-empirical model can be adopted for design 
and application purposes.

1. Introduction 
Until now, it is well-known that 
fiber-reinforced aluminum laminates (FRALL) 
have been successfully fabricated and 
commercialized [1]. The aramid 
fiber-reinforced aluminum laminates (ARALL) 
and glass fiber/aluminum (GLARE) were 
marketed by the Aluminum Company of 
America for wide applications, such as aircraft 
of composites subjected to variable loading, e.g., 
multi-block loading and spectrum loading, the 
precise and reliable damage model should be 
adopted. However, the existing cumulative 
damage theories [24-25] were suitable for 
metals, since their original development were 
based on metals. Thus, a reasonable 
modification of the theories is necessary for 
composite materials. Broutman and Sahu [26] 
used a modified linear Miner’s rule to predict 
life due to two-step loading. Owen [27-28] 
found the cumulative damage was nonlinear and 
proposed the quadratic cumulative damage rule. 
Whiworth [29] verified the life was 
overestimated due to low-high two step loading 
and underestimated for high-low loading by 
using Miner’s rule. Hwang and Han [30] 
adopted fatigue modulus and resultant strain as 
two parameters to set up cumulative damage 
theory and the results showed that the 
Palmgren-Miner’s damage sum to failure is 
greater than unity for low-high test and less than 
unity for high-low test. Fong [31] derived 
nonlinear damaged model based on fatigue 
cycle ratio, n/N, and damage growth rate. 
Statistical methods were used in treatment of 
multi-block loading as presented in [32]. 
From the bonding of Ti with APC-2 by the 
modified diaphragm curing process, Ti/APC-2 
hybrid nanocomposite laminates were 
successfully fabricated. Then, each sample was 
drilled a central hole for tests. Also, the 
mechanical properties subjected to both tensile 
and cyclic tests at room temperature were 
obtained. The failure mechanisms were 
observed. The response of mechanical behavior 
was highlighted. The cumulative damage was 
treated suitably. 
2. Fabrication 
The twelve-inch wide unidirectional 
AS-4/PEEK prepregs from Cytec Industries Inc. 
(USA) were cut and stacked into both cross-ply 
[0/90]s and quasi-isotropic [0/±45/90] laminates. 
The grade 1 (H: 0.015%, O: 0.18%, N: 0.03%, 
Fe: 0.2%, C: 0.08% ) Ti sheets, supplied by 
Kobe Steel Ltd (JAPAN), were 0.5mm thick 
after rolled, heated and flattened with scratch 
brushing. The density of grade l Ti is 4.51 g/cm
3
, 
melting point temperature is 1670°C, ultimate 
tensile strength is 305MPa, and modulus of 
elasticity is 71GPa. 
Prior to lamination, the slimmed Ti sheets 
were subjected to pretreatment in order to create 
the tough bonding with the APC-2 prepregs. 
Naturally, Ti sheets possess high resistance to 
chemical etching. Thus, two different surface 
treatments of titanium sheets were chosen, one 
by mechanical polishing method and another by 
chromic acid anodic method. The latter was 
found better as demonstrated by the results of 
tensile and cyclic tests even at elevated 
temperature. After anodic processing, the 
thickness of oxide coating film was about 
40~80nm. The anodic oxide coating was 
observed uniform by SEM, and the composition 
of coating consisting of TiO2 by EDS. The 
nanoparticles SiO2 (Nanostructured & 
Amorphous Materials, Inc. USA) possess the 
average diameter 15±5nm, specific surface area 
160±20m
2
/g, spherical crystallographic and 
amorphous powder. The optimal amount of 
SiO2 was found 1% by wt. of laminate [14]. 
The quasi-isotropic APC-2 nanocomposite 
were sandwiched with the Ti sheets to produce 
Ti/CF/PEEK hybrid laminates, expressed as 
Ti/APC-2/Ti/APC-2/Ti totally 5 layers. The 
modified diaphragm curing process was shown 
in Fig. 1. The geometry and dimensions of a 
hybrid nanocomposite specimen were shown in 
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. 
3. Experimental 
An MTS-810 servohydraulic 
computer-controlled dynamic material testing 
machine was used to conduct the tensile test and 
constant stress amplitude T-T cyclic test with 
stress ratio=0.1, frequency=5Hz, sinusoidal 
wave form under load-controlled mode at room 
temperatures. The two-step loading cyclic tests 
were conducted first to half life of 
corresponding load, then followed by last step 
load to failure. The applied cycles at 
corresponding load were tabulated and treated 
later 
4. Results 
The nanoscale structure of oxide layer which 
has been observed by SEM was shown in Fig. 4.

Keywords: Hybrid Composite Laminate, Titanium Sheet, APC-2, Mechanical Properties, 
Elevated Temperature 
Abstract. The Ti/APC-2 cross-ply composite laminates were successfully fabricated. The Ti 
thin sheets were surface treated by anodic oxidation to achieve good bonding with APC-2 
laminates, instead of chemical etching method used for Mg/APC-2 and Al/APC-2 laminates 
preciously. The modified diaphragm curing process was adopted to manufacture the hybrid 
laminates for minimal impact of production. 
Basically, the tensile tests at elevated temperature were conducted to obtain the baseline data 
of mechanical properties, such as strength and stiffness. Then, the tension-tension (T-T) 
constant stress amplitude cyclic tests were performed at elevated temperature to receive the 
S-N curves, fatigue strength and life. It is a surprise that almost no delaminations were 
observed in tensile and cyclic tests, even at elevated temperature. The received data of hybrid 
laminates can be predicted by the rule of mixtures (ROM) optimally.

The cross-ply APC-2 prepregs were sandwiched with the Ti sheets to produce Ti/CF/PEEK

Then, the stress vs. cycles (S-N) curves by mechanical polishing surface treatment of 
titanium sheet were received due to constant stress amplitude T-T tests at elevated 
temperatures as shown in Fig. 7. It is reasonable to see the curves go downwards as 
temperature rising. The normalized stress vs. cycles curves were shown in Fig. 8, in which the 
curves were almost mixed together. It needs be mentioned the normalized stress is the stress 
normalized by the ultimate strength at the corresponding temperature, not at RT. Next, from 
the S-N curves the samples due to anodic method of treatment in Ti sheets were found much 
better resistance to cyclic loading and no delaminations were observed as shown in Fig. 9. 
The normalized S-N curves were shown in Fig. 10. Some samples in Figs. 9 and 10 did not 
fail even over a million of cycles at elevated temperatures.

5 DISCUESSION  
It is interesting to see the ultimate strength of Ti/APC-2 laminates decreases as temperature 
rising; whilst, the longitudinal stiffness almost remains unchanged for both surface treatments. 
Also, it was obvious to find that the data of mechanical properties in Ti/APC-2 laminates by 
anodic method were much better than those by mechanical polishing, especially in ultimate 
strength. The ultimate strength increased about 5~10% due to chromic acid anodic method.
