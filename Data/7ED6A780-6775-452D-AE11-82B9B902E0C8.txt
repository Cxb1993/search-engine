1. Introduction 
In this project, we propose and/or 
evaluate algorithms for medium access 
control in wireless networks with 
multipacket reception [5] [11]. 
According to the conventional (0,1,e) 
channel model, when two or more nodes 
simultaneously send packets to the 
access point, a collision occurs and the 
access point does not receive/decode any 
packets. With multipacket reception 
capability, when two or more nodes 
simultaneously send distinct packets to 
the access point, an access point could 
successfully receive/decode one or more 
packets. Therefore, in a wireless 
network, multipacket reception 
capability could be used to increase the 
throughput without requiring more 
bandwidth, which is usually seen as 
scarce resource. Multipacket reception 
can be realized by CDMA multiuser 
detection techniques [31] or Successive 
Interference Cancellation [32].  
A multipacket reception channel is 
characterized by a matrix. We [24] 
analytically derived the network 
throughput and the average packet delay 
for the classic tree/stack splitting 
algorithm when the channel matrix of 
multipacket reception is a diagonal 
matrix. The classic tree/stack splitting 
algorithm is not designed for and 
therefore does not work in a wireless 
network with multipacket reception 
when the channel matrix is not a 
diagonal matrix. While there are many 
tree-based medium access control 
algorithms for the conventional collision 
channel (and channels with capture 
effects), to the best of our knowledge, in 
the literature, there are no distributed 
medium access control algorithms that 
are based on tree splitting and work for 
an arbitrary channel matrix of 
multipacket reception. In [34], we 
propose and evaluate novel splitting 
algorithms, each works for a wireless 
network with an arbitrary channel matrix 
of multipacket reception. In addition, for 
each of the three algorithms, it is 
unnecessary to know/estimate the value 
of the channel matrix of multipacket 
reception. Among the three splitting 
algorithms, the tree/stack splitting with 
remainder algorithm has the best 
performance in terms of network 
throughput and average packet delay. 
For the splitting with remainder 
algorithm, we mathematically derive the 
exact values of the network throughput 
and the average packet delay. We show 
that our analytical results are consistent 
with packet-based simulation results.  
Kleinrock and Tobagi [35] analyzed 
the performance of CSMA protocols 
based on the conventional (0,1,e) 
channel model. Chan and Berger [36] 
investigated the impact of multiple 
packet reception on CSMA, when each 
node always has packets to be 
5 
 
Chlamtac and Farago [8] studied 
the multipacket reception capability 
provided by multiple independent 
collision channels. Adireddy and Tong 
[14] studied the use of distributed 
channel state information for random 
access in wireless networks with 
multipacket reception. In particular, they 
proposed a variant of slotted Aloha in 
which the transmission probability 
changes with the channel state. Naware, 
Mergen, and Tong [15] studied the effect 
of multipacket reception on stability and 
delay of slotted Aloha. Luo and 
Ephremides [16] studied the impacts of 
transmission power control on the 
performance of random multiple access 
with multipacket reception. Gau [17][21] 
analytically derived the saturation 
throughput and the non-saturation 
throughput for slotted Aloha in wireless 
networks with multipacket reception. 
Dua [22] proposed a user-centric 
approach for evaluating the performance 
of slotted Aloha with multipacket 
reception in a wireless network in which 
the total number of nodes is finite but 
the buffer size at each node is infinity. 
Lotfinezhad, Liang, and Sousa [20] 
derived the optimal retransmission 
probabilities for slotted Aloha in 
wireless sensor networks with 
multipacket reception. Celik, Zussman, 
Khan, and Modiano [28] proposed 
alternative backoff mechanisms for 
medium access control in wireless 
networks with multipacket reception 
capability and spatially distributed nodes. 
An introduction on CSMA protocols for 
wireless networks with multipacket 
reception can be found in [27] [28] and 
reference therein. Choudhury, Yang, and 
Vaidya [4] proposed a multi-hop RTS 
protocol for medium access control in 
wireless ad hoc networks with 
directional antennas. Guo, Wang, and 
Wu [25] studied the capacity of wireless 
ad hoc networks with multiple packet 
reception.  
An introduction on polling-based 
protocols of medium access control with 
multipacket reception can be found in 
[11][18] and reference therein. Shad, 
Todd, Kezys, and Litva [10] introduced 
dynamic slot allocation for cellular 
systems with antenna arrays to utilize 
the multipacket reception capability. 
Zhao and Tong [11] proposed the MQSR 
(Multi-Queue Service Room) protocol 
for medium access control in wireless 
networks with multipacket reception. In 
addition, they proposed a dynamic 
queue protocol [13] that achieves a 
performance comparable to that of 
MQSR with a much lower 
computational complexity. Gau and 
Chen [18] proposed and analytically 
evaluated the predictive multicast 
polling scheme which is a queue-aware 
medium access control scheme for 
wireless networks with multipacket 
reception.

In addition, we evaluate the 
performance of the splitting with 
remainder algorithm when the buffer 
size at a node equals one but the channel 
matrix of multipacket reception is not a 
diagonal matrix. In Figure 5, we show 
that for the network throughput the 
numerical results are almost identical to 
the simulation results. In Figure 6, we 
show that for the average system size the 
numerical results are almost identical to 
the simulation results. In Figure 7, we 
show that for the average packet delay 
the numerical results are almost identical 
to the simulation results. Among the 
three variants of the tree/stack splitting 
algorithm, the splitting with remainder 
algorithms has the optimal performance 
in terms of the network throughput.  
 
 
Figure 5: the throughput for the splitting with 
remainder algorithm, 10 nodes, and buffer size 
equals one 
 
Figure 6: the average system size for the 
splitting with remainder algorithm, 10 nodes, 
and buffer size equals one 
 
 
Figure 7: the average packet delay for the 
splitting with remainder algorithm, 10 nodes, 
and buffer size equals one
