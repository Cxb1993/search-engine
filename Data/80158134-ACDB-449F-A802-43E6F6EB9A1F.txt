1Determination and Forecasting the Strength of Heat Source in an Inverse Hyperbolic Heat
Conduction Problem by the Linear Least-Squares Error Method and Grey System Theory
Pao-Tung Hsu
Abstract
This study is intended to provide an inverse method combined with grey system theory GM (1,1) model
for estimating and forecasting the strength of heat source about Non-Fourier heat conduction problem. At the
beginning of this study, finite-difference methods are employed to discrete the problem domain and then a linear
inverse model is constructed to identify the strength of heat source. The present approach is to rearrange the
matrix forms of differential governing equation and estimated coefficients of unknown condition. Then, the linear
least-squares method is adopted to find the solution. Using the estimating value forecasted the further data of heat
source by grey system theory DGM (1,1) model.
Applying this method in inverse analysis is that no prior information is needed on the functional form of the
unknown quantities, no initial guess is required and the iterations of calculation process can be done only once.
The grey forecasting model uses the operations of accumulated generation to build differential equations. The grey
modeling emphasis just needs using very little history data (about 4 sample data) to build the grey prediction
model, and then we can use this model to forecast the other further unknown output data. The advantage of
applying this GM(1,1) model in inverse analysis is that we can forecast the further unknown output data, then to
predict or to control generating equipment reliability, the device failure occurs can be avoid.

Introduction
The grey system theory was first proposed by
Deng [1], the fundamental concept is that all known
information in the natural world is white, the
unknown is black, and the uncertain-known and
uncertain-unknown regions between black and white
are grey. The grey system is primarily used to extract
fundamental system qualities when there is
insufficient information. It stresses system
information supplements, adequate use of known
white information, and execution of relational analysis
and model construction for the system, so that the
system is changed from grey to white. The grey theory
is method for analyzing, predicting, and rationalizing
a decision under insufficient information from a
system without sufficiently comprehensive data. This
theory is primarily aimed at performing relational
analysis and model construction for when a system
model's information is uncertain and insufficient. Also,
Prediction, Evaluation, and Decision are used to
investigate and understand the system.
The inverse source problem is the determination of
the strength of the heat source from the temperature
measured at a different point other than the source
locations. It is practical in much design and
manufacturing areas in which the strength of the heat
source is undetermined. Common problems include
the detection of the quantity of the energy generation
in a computer chip, or in a microwave heating process,
or in a chemical reaction process. The situations
involving very low temperatures near absolute zero,
very high temperature gradients, or extremely short
times, heat is found to propagate at a finite speed. For
these situations, the hyperbolic heat conduction (HHC)
model is employed to account for the phenomena of
finite heat propagation speed. Such non-Fourier
conduction equations have been used successfully to
examine rapid transient conduction processes in
chemical process engineering [2], laser pulse heating
[3], and laser annealing [4]. Guo and Xu [5] addressed
the non-Fourier conduction in an IC chip with
emphasis on the discrepancy from the Fourier
conduction and its influence on thermal reliability.
Many researchers have explored the HHC problem of
electronic component cooling in the form of a ‘direct 
problem’. However, when the heat flux or temperature
at electronic components is very high or other special
situations are concerned, direct measurement of
surface conditions is impossible. Practicaly, ‘inverse 
problems’ are applied in these cases. Measurements of
temperature are often made at one or more interior
locations of the substrate. Then these measurements
are curve-fitted to estimate physical quantities and
surface conditions.
To date, there are only limited numbers of
researches that work in the inverse source problem [9-
11, 17]. Most analytical and numerical methods have
only been used to deal with the Fourier’s conduction 
problem. For the HHC problem, the previous studies
[2-5] are restricted to the analysis of one-dimensional
direct problems. Due to the complicated reflection and
interaction of thermal waves, multi-dimensional
hyperbolic heat conduction problems are much more
difficult to solve than one-dimensional problems. To
the authors’ knowledge, the inverse source problem 
for dealing with multi-dimensional hyperbolic heat
conduction problems has little studies [10, 11, 17],
and no literature to consider the strength of heat
source about future time were happened. In order to
complement this deficiency, at least in part, of the
literature in this field, this study was intended to
further recent studies of the methodologies [12, 13]
combined with Dynamics Grey system theory DGM
(1,1) model for estimating and forecasting the strength
of heat source about Non-Fourier heat conduction
problem. The present approach is to rearrange the
matrix forms of differential governing equation and
estimated coefficients of unknown condition. Then,
the linear least-squares method is adopted to find the
solution. Using the estimating value forecasted the
further data of heat source by dynamic grey system
theory DGM (1,1) model.

Dynamic grey DGM forecast is an improved
model of the grey GM (1,1) forecast mode, which
mainly uses several data entries in the same series
(usually 4 points) to construct a GM (1,1) model, and
then predict the value of the next data entry, then
abandon the first data entry from the original series,
add a fifth data entry to construct a second series,
forecast the value of the sixth data entry, etc., until
the last data entry in the original data. Because
dynamic grey forecasting methods are founded on
the belief of newer information being superior to
older information to dynamically adjust changes in
the development trends of the series, therefore, it can
demonstrate higher forecast accuracy for data that
exhibits more volatile trend developments.
Results and Discussion
The inverse problem defined by Eqs. (1) - (3) is
used in the following examples to verify the
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of the proposed
method for estimating the strength of the heat sorce
(x,y,t). All the computation is performed on a PC
with an 80486 microprocessor. Considering the
capacity of memory, each of the dimensionless
spatial intervals 0.0x1.0, and 0.0y1.0 is
divided into 8 intervals for all examples of the direct
problem. Twenty steps of dimensionless time are
taken. The iteration step corresponds to a mesh size
of x = y = 0.125, and t = 0.1.
The exact dimensionless temperature and the heat
sorce (x,y,t) used in the following examples are
preselected so that these functions can satisfy
equations (3)-(5). The accuracy of the proposed
method is assessed by comparing the estimated
results with the preselected values of the heat sorce
(x,y,t). Meanwhile, the temperature distributions
at some specific positions where the thermocouples
are assumed to be installed are generated from the
preselected exact dimensionless temperature in each
case of the board. In a real engineering application,
the temperature measurements are always subject to
a certain degree of measurement error. Hence, the
simulated temperature value used in the inverse
method, is given by:
T measurement = T exact (1+) (20)
where T exact is the exact temperature calculated
from the direct problem, T measurement is the
measured temperature at the grid points,  is
temperature measurement error, and  is the
random error of measurement and lies within the
range of -1 to 1. The measurement errors are caused
by the interpolation of the measuring instruments,
uncertainty due to calibration, and fluctuation in
sensor reading during measurement.
In the simulation problem, the accuracy of the
estimation of unknowns from the knowledge of the
temperature at measurement points depends strongly
on the accuracy of the measurements. As will be seen
in the examples, the estimated solutions without
measurement error (= 0) converge to the solutions
solved by the finite-difference method for all
examples. Furthermore, the solutions are unique
through the proposed verifying method. Using the
above inverse method to have the estimating value,
then tahing this value to forecast the further date
about the strength of the heat source. Detailed
descriptions for the problem are presented as follows.
Example 1:
The unknown heat sorce (x,y,t) is taken as:
(x,y,t)=1.0 0.0t1.0 x=0.375, y=0.375
(x,y,t)=0.0 1.0t2.0 x=0.375, y=0.375
The estimated value using two measurement
points (x,y) = (0.25, 0.25), (0.5, 0.5) without
considering measurement errors are presented in Fig.
1. The inverse values from the present study are a
litter difference with the direct solutions. In the
Fourier heat conduction problem without
measurement errors that has a better estimated values.
Due to the complicated reflection and interaction of
the thermal waves, it is difference from the inverse
Fourier heat conduction problem
Fig. 1 also shows a comparison of the estimated
heat sorce (x,y,t) for measurement errors of =
0.1%, 1.0%, and 10.0% with two measurement
points (of positions located at (x,y) = (0.25, 0.25)
(0.5, 0.5)). The result shows that the magnitudes of
the discrepancies in heat sorce heat sorce (x,y,t),
4oscillations in the vicinity of the jump discontinuity.
This phenomenon is known as the Gibbs
phenomenon, which is of practical importance since
it causes difficulty to obtain a convergent solution in
the neighborhood of the jump discontinuity [7]. The
phenomenon reflects the fact that the inverse non-
Fourier heat conduction problem is different from the
inverse Fourier heat conduction problem.
One shortcoming of this method is that it is
needed to solve a system of simultaneous equations.
Besides, the inverse matrix R [Eq. (8)] is very
sensitive to temperature measurement error, which
renders it ill-conditioned and unstable. The
sensitivity depends on the type of problem being
solved (i.e., the governing equation and its boundary
conditions), the position at which the temperature is
measured and the measurement error. The present
results confirm that the inverse values are extremely
sensitive to the measurement error, sensor locations,
the number of sensors and the range of measurement
time interval, as mentioned by Beck et al. [16] and
Hensel [21]. The advantage of applying this method
in inverse analysis is that we can forecast the further
unknown output data, then to predict or to control
generating equipment reliability, the device failure
occurs can be avoid.
Conclusion
An efficient algorithm has been introduced for
estimating the strength of heat sorce (x,y,t) in the
inverse non-Fourier heat conduction problem. A
direct inverse formulation is constructed using the
reverse matrix, which is derived from the governing
equations as well as initial and boundary conditions.
Three examples have been examined to show the
robustness of the proposed method. The results of
example 1 show that the exact solution can be found
with only two points while the measurement error is
neglected. When the measurement error is concerned,
the magnitudes of the discrepancies for the heat sorce
(x,y,t) are directly proportional to the size of the
measurement error. This phenomenon is due to the
complicated reflection and interaction of thermal
waves. A special feature of this method is that the
value of the unknown heat sorce (x,y,t) can be
estimated directly by solving the inverse problem in
a linear domain with only one calculation process.
This implies that the present model offers a greater
deal of flexibility. The advantage of applying
GM(1,1) model in inverse analysis is that we can
forecast the further unknown output data, then to
predict or to control generating equipment reliability,
the device failure occurs can be avoid. After all, the
results confirm that the proposed method is effective
for other kinds of inverse problems — such as heat
flux estimation, boundary estimation, and initial
estimation in the one- or multi-dimensional transient
non-Fourier heat conduction problems.
