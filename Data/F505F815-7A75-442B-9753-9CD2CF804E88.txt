2particulates and fabricating through micropowder injection molding. The reported
techniques include blending, molding, de-binding, and sintering processes. Some
defects, for instance, high shrinkage of microparts, may occur and result in cracking.
Through this technique, however, property improvement in strength and wear
resistance can be obtained.
Schneider et al. [12] added microfiller to plastics to reinforce their structures and
reduce shrinkage. However, the fillers could not be used successfully in the
micromolding process. This was because the fillers, such as glass fibers with a typical
diameter of 10μm and a length of 100 to 500μm, were often as big as the molding
microparts. Thus, microparts with added nano-size particulates could possibly be used
in microinjection molding. However, it was difficult to disperse nano-particulates
uniformly in the polymeric compound through a kneading process. Song et al. [13]
showed their control in the kneading process to manufacture various zirconia
feedstocks. The powder agglomeration of the feedstock was retained due to
insufficient shear stress. In this case, the agglomeration still existed after parts were
sintered.
Wu and Wei [14-16] conducted a series of the measurements on the homogeneity
of submicron-powder in the feedstocks for precision injection molding. The
agglomerated powders were shear-kneaded and could be uniformly dispersed in the
binder by appropriate kneading control. The results strongly revealed that ceramic
feedstocks have good quality only if the kneading process was conducted not only by
a strong shear force, but also by effective kneading energy adsorbed by the plastic
mixture. However, the properties, e.g. strength and wear, of kneaded polymer/powder
mixtures were not investigated.
PP is one of the popular plastics for the parts used in micro-electromechanical
system (MEMS), such as microgears and microfans in electrical appliances and
automotive applications. PP is easily modified with blending elastomers and inorganic
filler in order to obtain higher mechanical performances. In the meantime, ZnO, a
popular semiconductor material with a high excitonic binding energy, facilitates
several optical-electronic behaviors at room temperature. ZnO is also found to be a
significantly harder material used to fabricate nanowires and nanotips [17-18].
In this study, a homogeneous feedstock with added commercial ZnO
nanoparticles and dispersant was produced under the optimum kneading process. The
wear and mechanical properties were enhanced by the homogeneous feedstock. In
addition, this paper also discusses the reproducibility of the microparts made with
feedstock through microinjection molding.
EXPERIMENTAL
4nano-ZnO, wear, tensile, and flexural tests were conducted in this study. Wear tests
were carried out by using a pin-on-disk tester (Micro Phonics, USA). Cylindrical
specimens with a diameter of 8 mm and a thickness of 10 mm were used in wear tests,
following the conditions specified in ASTM G99-04. Round specimens were placed in
contact with the disk which had a surface roughness of 0.2μm (Ra) at a position 37
mm from the center and rotated from 2,500 (0.58km) to 30,000 revolutions (6.97km)
with a step increase of 2,500 revolutions at a constant speed of 70rpm. The vertical
load on the pin was 0.5kgf. Then, the mass of each specimen was measured using an
electronic weighing machine (Honeywell, UK). The mass loss ( m ) was then
calculated as follows:
m = %100
m
mm
, (1)
Where m is the mass before wearing and mis the residual mass after wearing test. To
achieve high quality, low mass loss is required. In addition, tensile and flexural
specimens were conducted in a universal testing machine (MTS 810, USA) according
to ASTM D638 and D790, respectively. The results were averaged from ten
specimens.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Dispersive properties in heptane
The sedimentation results of ZnO nanoparticles with different dispersants are
shown in Fig. 1. The sample with FP1 additive exhibited the least sedimentation
height. The height ratio (Hf/Ho) of the ZnO nanoparticles with FP1 decreased to 30%
compared to that without surfactant. However, the other two systems, either SA or the
combination of FP1 and SA, were shown to be less effective for the dispersion of the
nanoparticles. Therefore, FP1 surfactant was used for the samples in following tests.
From the sedimentation results, the Hf /Ho ratio of the ZnO sample with added
FP1 was about 14%, which means about 14% nanoparticles cannot be uniformly
dispersed in PP polymer. In other words, the nanoparticles may show some degree of
particle agglomeration. In order to reveal the states of the agglomeration, TEM
(Transmission Electron Microscopy, JEOL 100CXII, Japan) was used to analyze the
morphologies of the nanoparticles. One typical micrograph of the ZnO nanoparticles
is shown in Fig. 2. The image revealed that the ZnO nanoparticles are apparently
agglomerated. The result was that these primary nanoparticles could not be 100%
dispersed due to strong bonding between particles.
Kneading behavior and dimensional accuracy of microgears
The kneading response of the PP polymer with 1wt% added nanoparticles was
6shown in Fig. 6. The mass loss increased significantly when the specimens were
contact-worn for up to 3km. However, the mass loss steadily increased when the
specimens were rotated more than 3km. Polymer with 1wt% added nanoparticles
exhibited the lowest wear result, while a part with 15wt% added nanoparticles
exhibited the highest wear result. In addition, the mass loss of the composites with
0.5wt%, 1wt%, and 3wt% added nanoparticle showed 20.2%, 53.1%, and 0.1%,
respectively, lower than that of a pure PP. The composite with 1wt% added
nanoparticles exhibited an optimum wear resistance.
The wear result of the composites tested after rotating 6.97km is shown in Fig. 7.
The wear dramatically increased as the nanofiller content exceeded 3wt%. The results
contradicted the intuition that a composite with more abrasive powder resisted
contact-wearing. In order to find the reasons, SEM images of the composites with
added nanoparticle were shown in Fig. 8. In the case of the composite with 1wt%
added nanoparticles, the particles were slightly agglomerated, as shown in Fig. 8(a).
Several nanoparticles agglomerated to form a particle cluster in a size of 60nm.
However, most nanoparticles were uniformly distributed in the polymer compound.
The wear resistance was effectively improved when 1wt% nanoparticle was
added in PP. During wearing, the polymer was removed, leaving only the ceramic
powders, which were much harder than the neighboring polymeric substrate and
resisted abrasive wear. After the particles were removed, the neighboring polymeric
matrix continued to wear. Thus, the composite, although it contained only 1wt%
nanoparticle, could significantly increase the resistance.
However, the PP with 5wt% added nanoparticle revealed apparent agglomeration
state, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The resistance was significantly weakened because the
nanoparticles were not uniformly distributed in the matrix. The ZnO nanoparticles
could not be fully dispersed due to the agglomeration, as concluded in Sec.3.1. The
other reason was due to the kneading machine, which was not effective in dispersing
nanoparticles in the polymer when more nanoparticles were added. The composite
with 15wt% added nanoparticle revealed serious agglomeration, as shown in Fig. 8(c),
resulting in greater mass loss. The micrograph showed that the nanoparticles could not
be firmly embedded in PP substrate. The nanoparticles lost the function of
reinforcement due to a lack of coupling force by the substrate. The results indicated
that uniform distribution of nanofillers and firm combination with the polymeric
matrix was very important for the production of reinforced composites.
Crystallization temperature and mechanical properties of nanocomposites
To understand the relationship between the crystallization temperature and
mechanical properties of nanocomposites, the crystallization temperatures of PP with
8shown in Fig. 11(c). The cracks continually extended among the nanoparticle clusters
because the nanoparticles were in agglomeration when more than 5% nanoparticles
were added into the polymer.
CONCLUSION
A homogeneous feedstock with added nanofillers and dispersant was produced
under the optimal kneading process. Microparts made with feedstock could be
successfully manufactured through microinjection molding. The standard deviation of
the diameter of microparts was decreased with an increase in the nanofiller content in
PP polymer. The results showed that the reproducibility of the microinjection molding
using the composites with added nanofiller was outstanding. In addition, high quality
parts could only be fabricated when the mold and processing temperatures were
stable.
Only a small amount (1wt%) of the nanofiller needed to be added to PP to
increase wear resistance. Larger amounts (>5wt%) of the nanofillers in the polymeric
matrix resulted in less resistance to contact wearing than pure polymer. The
nanoparticles in 1wt% were effectively dispersed in the matrix, but >5wt% of
nanoparticles were agglomerated in the substrate and resulting in a poor wear
resistance.
The mechanical properties increased with increasing the crystallization
temperature when the nanoparticle content was increased to 5wt% in the composites.
The mechanical strength of the PP polymer can be effectively improved by adding
small amount of the nanofiller. However, the composite with >15wt% nanoparticles
showed weaker strength. Suitable quantity of the nanoparticles added in PP and
uniform distribution of the nanoparticles are important factors for producing high
quality parts.
