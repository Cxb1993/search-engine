Abstract 
In this paper, an evolutionary approach is proposed to 
obtain a discrete-time state-space interval model for 
uncertain continuous-time systems having interval 
uncertainties. Based on a worst-case analysis, the 
problem to derive the discrete interval model is first 
formulated as multiple mono-objective optimization 
problems for matrix-value functions associated with the 
discrete system matrices, and subsequently optimized via 
a proposed genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the lower 
and upper bounds of the entries in the system matrices. 
To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, 
roots clustering of the characteristic equation of the 
obtained discrete interval model is illustrated for 
comparison with those obtained via existing methods.  
 
Keywords: Discrete modelling, evolutionary algorithms, 
uncertain continuous-time systems, interval plant, 
discretization, model conversion, sampled-data systems. 
 
1. Introduction 
Most practical systems, such as flight vehicles, electric 
motors, and robots, are formulated in continuous-time 
uncertain settings. The uncertainties in these systems 
arise from unmodelled dynamics, parameter variation, 
sensor noises, actuator constraints, etc. These variations 
of the uncertain parameters generally do not follow any 
of the known probability distributions and are most often 
quantified in terms of bounds [1]-[2]. Hence, practical 
systems or plants are most suitably represented by 
continuous-time parametric interval models [3]-[5], 
rather than deterministic mathematical models. Simple as 
they might be, uncertain models in the form of interval 
systems have provided a convenient way in constructing 
mathematical models for physical systems, based on 
which practical design can be achieved for use in 
industry. It is no wonder that a large body of literature 
[4], [6] exploring robustness and performance issues of 
interval systems over the past few years. 
On the other hand, digital control is getting more and 
more popular. The current trend toward digital control of 
dynamic systems is mainly due to the availability of low-
cost digital computers and the advantages found in 
working with digital signals [7]. It is also well known 
that digital control [8]-[10] provides many advantages 
over the analogue control in terms of reliability, 
flexibility, cost, performance, etc. For digital simulation 
and digital design of continuous-time systems, however, 
it is essential to find an equivalent discrete-time model 
from the continuous-time model subject to digital control 
by using a zero-order hold (ZOH). Thanks to continuous 
efforts made to solve this problem over the past years, 
model conversion of a nominal continuous-time state-
space model to an equivalent discrete-time state-space 
model has been well established and reported in the 
literature [11]-[14]. However, for uncertain continuous 
systems having an interval structure, the exact discrete-
time state-space model for the sampled system is 
difficult to obtain, if not impossible [15], because the 
entries of the discrete system matrices depend non-
linearly on the uncertain plant parameters. This has 
seriously prevented the applicability of available 
robustness results [16]-[17] in the discrete-time domain.  
To solve the problem in deriving a suitable discrete-
time model for uncertain interval plants, several attempts 
have been made over the past years to develop methods 
to obtain approximate discrete-time interval models 
which tightly enclose the exact discrete-time model of 
the continuous-time uncertain system [1], [18]-[20]. 
Among these methods, Oppenheimer and Michel [18] 
used an interval Taylor-series approximation method to 
convert a continuous-time uncertain system to an 
equivalent discrete-time interval model. Shieh et al. [19] 
developed an approximation method to convert a 
continuous-time uncertain system to an equivalent 
discrete-time interval model by applying the Pade 
approximation and the interval arithmetic, where the 
exponential function of an interval system matrix is 
approximated by a rational interval matrix-valued 
function. Shieh et al. [1] also proposed an interval 
geometric-series approximation method together with 
interval arithmetic to convert a continuous-time 
uncertain system to an equivalent discrete-time interval 
model. The aforementioned methods claimed that the 
obtained interval models were guaranteed to enclose the 
exact discrete-time uncertain model. Nevertheless, 
without carefully manipulating the developed results, the 
interval method might give a very conservative model, 
owing to the inherent conservativeness of the interval 
arithmetic [20]. In an attempt to find a less conservative 
discrete-time interval model, a GA-based method [20] 
was proposed to search the lower and upper bounds of 
the enclosing discrete-time interval system matrices. 
Unfortunately, the results obtained via this approach 
failed to enclose the exact discrete-time model, as will be 
demonstrated in the example of this paper. From the 
above-mentioned discussions, we can say that discrete 
modelling of continuous-time uncertain state-space 
models has not been sufficiently explored, and there is a 
need to derive an equivalent discrete-time interval state-
space model with better accuracy suitable for digital 
simulation and design of the uncertain interval systems 
by using the available robustness results in the discrete-
time domain [16]-[17]. 
Recent developments of evolutionary algorithms 
[21]-[26] have provided a promising alternative to solve 
the above-mentioned problem because of their 
capabilities of directed random search for global 
optimization [27]-[28]. This motivates the use of genetic 
algorithms to derive a less conservative discrete-time 
interval model for uncertain continuous–time systems by 
overbounding the uncertain plant parameters. Based on a 
worst-case analysis, the problem to derive the discrete-
time interval model is first formulated as multiple mono-
objective optimization problems for matrix-value 
functions associated with the discrete-time system 
matrices, and subsequently minimized and maximized 
via a proposed genetic algorithm to obtain the lower and 
upper bounds for the entries of the system matrices. 
Performance verification of the obtained discrete interval 
model based on roots clustering of the characteristic 
 3
, where ija  and uvb  are the ijth and uvth elements of 
IA  
and IB , respectively. ija  and uvb  denote the lower 
bounds of ija  and uvb , while ija  and uvb  denote the 
upper bounds of ija  and uvb , respectively. Degenerate 
matrices rr BA  , , on the other hand, are composed of real 
numbers rija  and ruvb  , respectively: 
] , [ ],[ ijijrijrijr aaaa ∈=A   (17) 
] , [ ],[ uvuvruvruvr bbbb ∈=B   (18) 
Therefore, we can directly use real-number arithmetic 
operation to evaluate Eqs. (11-12). 
As far as the discrete-time system is concerned, the 
entries in the uncertain system matrices 
][ ],[ uvij hg == HG  can be expressed as matrix-value 
functions: 
),( Tag ijijij α=  and ),,( Tbah uvijuvuv β=  
 (19)
 
respectively, where ijg  is a function of ija  and T, and 
uvh  is a function of ija , uvb , and T. We can obtain the 
upper and lower bounds for each entry in the system 
matrices G  and H  by optimizing the corresponding 
matrix-value functions ijα  and uvβ . That is, 
njiaTgaTg ijijijijijij ,,2,1,  ),,(max),,(min L=== αα

baThbaTh uvijuvuvuvijuvuv
,,2,1;,,2,1,,
  ),,,(max),,,(min
LL ==
== ββ  
(21) 
Therefore, we can obtain a discrete-time interval model 
( IG , IH ), which encloses the exact discrete model 
( HG  , ), such that

Note that the matrix-value functions ijα , uvβ  in Eq. (19) 
are nonlinear and generally nonconvex functions of ija  
and ),( uvij ba , respectively, in the searching space of the 
uncertain plant parameters. Gradient-based optimization 
algorithms generally lead to solutions that have local 
properties only. Genetic algorithms, with their power as 
an efficient and robust alternative for solving complex 
and highly nonlinear optimization problems, are 
therefore used to identify the lower and upper bounds of 
the entries in the discrete system matrices. 
 
3.1 Population Initialization 
Basically, genetic algorithms are probabilistic algorithms 
which maintain a population of individuals 
(chromosomes, vectors) for iteration t. Each 
chromosome represents a potential solution to the 
problem at hand, and is evaluated to give some measure 
of its “fitness”. Then, a new population is formed by 
selecting the more fit individuals. Some members of the 
new population undergo transformations by means of 
genetic operators to form new solutions. After some 
number of generations, it is hoped that the system 
converges with a near-optimal solution [27]-[28]. A 
genetic algorithm requires a population of potential 
solutions to be initialized and maintained during the 
process.  In this paper, a fixed number of the population 
size N is used. Real number representation for potential 
solutions is adopted to simplify genetic operator 
definitions and obtain a better performance of the genetic 
algorithm itself. Thus, there are no encoding and 
decoding operations involved, which is particularly 
useful if vast amount of parameters are to be adjusted.  
Assume that t
kX  is the k-th chromosome in a 
population of N at generation t, which represents entries 
of the continuous interval system matrices IA  and IB  in 
Eqs. (15-16) and is defined as: 
Nkmvnuji

=X   
 (26) 
Initial chromosomes are randomly generated from within 
the pre-defined range: 
njiaaa ijijij ,,2,1,for ],,[ L==  (27) [ ] mvnubbb uvuvuv ,,2,1 and  ,,,2,1for   ,, LL ===  
  (28) 
After initialization, several genetic operations are 
performed during procreation. 
 
3.2 Fitness evaluation 
Basically, there are )( mnnn ×+×  matrix-value 
functions associated with the discrete-time model, 
i.e. njiaT ijij ,,2,1,   ),,( L=α  and 
mvnubaT uvijuv ,,2,1 ,,,2,1   ),,,( LL ==β , which are 
nonlinear function of the uncertain plant parameters. We 
need to establish fitness functions to direct the evolution 
process for optimizing the matrix-value functions in 
Eq.(19). To reduce redundancy, we assume that 
Nkf tk ,,2,1   , L= , represents the evaluation of 
chromosome tkX  for the matrix-value functions of either 
),( ijij aTα  or ),,( uvijuv baTβ , depending on the 
optimization problem under consideration. The upper 
bound tf  and lower bound tf  in evaluating the 
chromosomes in the current population  t  for a particular 
matrix-value function can be obtained as follows: 
},,2,1 ,min{ Nkff tk
t L==  
},,2,1 ,max{ Nkff tk
t L==  
, respectively.

hand, the other two methods, though enclosing the 
exact discrete-time model, however, provide more 
conservative results than the proposed method. It is 
clear that root clustering of the characteristic equation 
of the discrete model obtained by using the proposed 
GA-based method bears a closer resemblance to that of 
the exact discrete model. Pade approximation method 
[19] and the interval geometric-series approximation 
method [1] both failed to obtain a satisfactory 
performance as demonstrated in this example.

Although the results are very close to those obtained via 
the proposed approach, there is, however, a significant 
difference as far as enclosure of the exact discrete-time 
model is concerned. That is, the interval model revealed 
in [20] did not enclose the exact discret-time interval 
model. For instance, when
