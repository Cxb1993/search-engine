use the NH-LDPC codes in encrypted data transmission, 
where the target syndrome b is used as the secret key 
(available only to legitimate users) for encryption 
and decryption. One problem is that, even without the 
knowledge of b, an illegitimate user can still 
demodulate a codeword’s systematic part, albeit with 
a much higher error probability than legitimate ones. 
To counter this problem, a descrambler is 
incorporated at the receiver to magnify the effect of 
the errors from demodulation so that the illegitimate 
user can not obtain intelligible information content. 
Simulations show thatthe proposed joint coding-
encryption scheme works well as long as the channel 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is properly controlled to 
lie within a specific range.

target syndrome is that Hx is the syndrome and x is a
codeword if and only if its syndrome hits the target, which is b.
The members, expressed in the form of 𝑛-component column
vectors, in 𝒞 are codewords. Obviously, nonhomogeneous
LDPC codes include conventional LDPC codes as a special
case, wherein the target syndrome is set to be the zero vector
in GF(𝑞)𝑚×1.
Next, let us describe how to carry out encoding and de-
coding for nonhomogeneous LDPC codes. The decoding is
presented first. Then, the encoding follows.
A. Decoding of nonhomogeneous LDPC codes
Decoding of NH-LDPC codes is almost the same as homo-
geneous LDPC codes. Here let us adopt the notations 𝑟𝑥𝑚𝑛 and
𝑞𝑥𝑚𝑛 from MacKay and Neal’s paper [7], where 𝑚 and 𝑛 are
indices to the check nodes and the variable nodes, respectively.
We want to admit that our use of the notations 𝑚 and 𝑛 is
a little inconsistent (but convenient, in the sense of taking
advantage of MacKay and Neal’s paper [7]). They are indices
to the check/variable nodes in this subsection (i.e. Sec. II-A),
but they are the parameters describing the size of the PCM H
in any other part of this paper. Returning to the decoding issue,
the only modification needed for the NH-LDPC decoding is
to change the second half of the “Horizontal step” (i.e. belief
propagation from check node 𝑚 to variable node 𝑛) in [7] into
set 𝑟0𝑚𝑛 =
{
(1 + 𝛿𝑟𝑚𝑛)/2 , if 𝑏𝑚 = 0 ,
(1− 𝛿𝑟𝑚𝑛)/2 , if 𝑏𝑚 = 1 , (2)
and 𝑟1𝑚𝑛 = 1 − 𝑟0𝑚𝑛, where 𝑏𝑚 is the 𝑚th component of the
target syndrome b. 𝑏𝑚 can also be interpreted as the intended
check sum at the 𝑚th check node. Graphically interpreted as
the check node in the Tanner graph [8], the effect of 𝑏𝑚 being
0 or 1 is shown in Fig. 1. The “Vertical step” (i.e. belief
propagation from a variable node to a check node) in [7],
which computes 𝑞𝑥𝑚𝑛, remains the same for the NH-LDPC
decoding. Iterative belief propagation between the “Vertical
step” and the new “Horizontal step” (i.e. Eq. (2)) produces
the decoded codeword.
B. Encoding of nonhomogeneous LDPC codes
In encoding a message word into a codeword of an NH-
LDPC code, so far we have been successful only for the
systematic fashion. More precisely speaking, the codeword x
consists of two parts: s and p, which are the (𝑛 − 𝑚) × 1
message vector and the 𝑚 × 1 parity vector, respectively.
Furthermore, the PCM H is splitted into two submatrices H1
(of size 𝑚 × (𝑛 −𝑚)) and H2 (of size 𝑚 ×𝑚) so that the
code defining condition (i.e. the condition that defines C in
Eq (1)) can be rewritten as
Hx =
[
H1 H2
] [ s
p
]
= b (3)
Rearranging Eq.(3) and assuming that H2 is nonsingular, we
obtain the equation for computing the parity check vector:
p = H−12 (b−H1s) . (4)
Obviously, here the nonsingularity of H2 is a key constraint.
In addition, since H2 is part of the PCM of a LDPC code, it
should be sparse and free of 4-branch cycles (usually referred
to as “cycle-4 free”). The design for a nonsingular, sparse,
and cycle-4 free matrix is not a trivial issue. We describe our
approach for generating such a matrix in the next subsection.
C. PCM for systematic nonhomogeneous LDPC codes
It is well known that short cycles, especially cycles consist-
ing of 4 branches, in a PCM’s corresponding Tanner graph lead
to poor decoding performance (measured in BER (bit error
rate)). Therefore, we must use cycle-4 free PCM’s in LDPC
codes. A necessary condition for the PCM H = [H1 H2]
(as defined in Eq. (3)) to be cycle-4 free is that H2 should
be cycle-4 free. In addition, we learned that H2 must be
nonsingular from Sec. II-B. Our proposal is to impose the
circulant structure on H2, with three 1’s on each row, to
simplify its design. More precisely speaking, let the first row
of H2 have nonzero elements (i.e. 1’s) only at positions 1,
1 + 𝛿1, 1 + 𝛿1 + 𝛿2, where 𝛿1 and 𝛿2 are positive integers,
and 1 + 𝛿1 + 𝛿2 ≤ 𝑚. From the second row on, any row is
obtained by circulantly shifting the row immediately above
to the right. If there are even number of 1’s in one row of
H2, then its determinant is 0 (because summing all column to
the rightmost column produces an all-zero column). If there
are odd number of 1’s randomly placed in one row of H2,
it is observed then that H2 has about a 50% chance of being
nonsingular. As to the issue of avoiding length-4 cycles in H2,
we can apply the following theorem:
The H2 as constructed above is cycle-4 free if and only if
2Δ1 +Δ2 ∕= 𝑚 for all of the three choices of (Δ1,Δ2):
(Δ1,Δ2) = (𝛿1, 𝛿2), (𝛿2,𝑚 − 𝛿1 − 𝛿2), and (𝑚 − 𝛿1 −
𝛿2, 𝛿1).
After H2 has been constructed, the next step is to construct
H1. In the construction of H1, the only criterion is that it
does not result in any length-4 cycles in H. Since H1 is also
sparse, avoiding length-4 cycles in H is not difficult. We start
by randomly placing 𝜆−3 1’s in the first of row of H1, where
𝜆 is the row-weight of H. Then, another 𝜆−3 1’s are randomly
placed into the second row of H1. We then check whether any
length-4 cycle exists in H. If yes, we randomly shift some of
the 1’s in this row of H1 to its neighboring positions and
recheck the cycle-4 condition. Since H is sparse, repeating

Input BER
Fig. 5. Transfer characteristics of the descrambler
BER of tˆE (at the descrambler output) is much higher than the
BER of sˆE. Through proper setup for the channel SNR (signal-
to-noise power ratio) to get a medium-to-low BER of s′, we
can drive the BER of tˆE to be so high that tˆE becomes totally
unintelligible. As to Bob, he can properly perform the NH-
LDPC decoding because he knows b. Therefore, the decoded
result of s, which is denoted as sˆB in Fig. 4, has a very
low BER as long as the channel SNR is not very low. Then,
even after the error magnification effect, the descrambled data
sequence tˆB still has a very low (or at least acceptable) BER.
There can be various ways to implement the scram-
bler/descrambler pair. In this paper, we choose to use random
but invertible matrices for them. Shown in Fig. 5 is the
transfer characteristics (i.e. output BER vs. input BER) for
a descrambler of length 255. In other words, the A−1 in
Fig. 4 is a 255 × 255 matrix. In this figure, we see that this
descrambler magnifies the BER by a factor of approximately
127.5 (= 255/2) for very low input BER.
IV. SIMULATION ON ENCRYPTED DATA TRANSMISSION
In this section, we check what Bob and Eve will receive
during the encrypted data transmission with the scheme pro-
posed in the previous section, through simulation. A binary
image (the logo of NTUST: the denoised version of Fig7(a))
is used as the source data sent out by Alice. The received
results by Bob and Eve are shown in terms of visual images
and BER’s.
The setup for the simulation is described below. The PCM
used for the NH-LDPC encoding/decoding in Fig. 4 is the
one shown in Fig. 2, which corresponds to a (510, 255) code.
The descrambler is a binary 255 × 255 invertible matrix,
whose transfer characteristic is shown in Fig. 5. The interleaver
operates on the whole image. The secret key (i.e. the target
syndrome) b is a random binary vector of length 255. The
modulation is BPSK (binary-phase shift keying). The channel
is AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise).
Before we actually feed the source data into the proposed
encryption scheme and then pass it through the channel, we
can do some theoretical analysis regarding the BER’s as
sensed by Bob and Eve. Fig. 6 shows the BER of Bob and
Eve before and after the descrambling. The leftmost curve is
Bob’s BER before the descrambling. Actually, it is exactly
the rightmost curve in Fig. 3. After descrambling, this BER is
raised (by a factor of about 127.5 when the SNR is high). The
result is the curve with the legend “NH-LDPC+Descrambler”.
More precisely speaking, the composition of the NH-LDPC
BER curve in Fig. 3 and the transfer characteristics of the
descrambler in Fig. 5 produces the “NH-LDPC+Descrambler”
curve in Fig. 6. Next let us try to analyze what happens to
Eve when she tries to eavesdrop the data sent out by Alice.
Since Eve does not have the secret key b, she can not perform
the NH-LDPC decoding. The best she can do is to directly
extract the systematic part of the received codeword, which
is modulated by BPSK. Therefore, Eve suffers a BER of
𝑄(
√
2 ⋅ SNR ⋅𝑅), where 𝑅 is the code rate (= 1/2 in our
simulation scenario) and 𝑄(𝑧) is the probability that a standard
normal random variable is greater than 𝑧. In Fig. 6, this is
the curve with the legend “BPSK(code rate=0.5)”. This curve
shows the BER suffered by Eve before the descrambling. After
the desrambling, however, this curve is raised (through the
mapping by the curve in Fig. 5). The result is the topmost
curve in Fig. 6 and represents the BER as sensed by Eve after
the desrambling.
Shown in Figs. Fig. 7-8 are two received results, corre-
sponding to two different SNR’s, by Bob and Eve (i.e. the mˆB
and mˆE in Fig. 4), where a binary image of size 750 × 500
was used as the source data. The SNR value for each image
transmission is show in the figure caption. In addition to the
visual presentation of the received images, the BER’s are also
shown in the figures. From those figures, we see that Bob
received clear (although a little corrupted) images while Eve
received illegible images. Actually, we had many more similar
results from our simulation. Based on those results, we roughly
conclude that the acceptance BER threshold for Bob is 0.001
and the rejection BER threshold for Eve is 0.465. We use those
two thresholds to intersect Bob’s and Eve’s BER curves in
Fig. 6. The intersection of BER= 0.001 and Bob’s BER curve
occurs at SNR= 3.8dB, which means that in order for Bob to
