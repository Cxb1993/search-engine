non-uniform surface morphology results from different discharging capacities 
between α and β. Therefore, it is difficult to develop a suitable pretreatment to obtain 
an undercoat on which a protective metal deposit can be electroplated. Many 
researchers [14,15] have proposed that zinc or nickel could be directly plated onto 
magnesium and used as an undercoat for a subsequent protective coating. Most 
pretreatment processes proposed for Mg alloys are relatively complicated; 
furthermore, pretreatment is performed in a bath with highly toxic chromate or 
hydrofluoric acid [8,9]. We have proposed an eco-friendly electroplating process to 
achieve a protective Ni/Cu deposit on pure Mg, AZ31, and AZ61 Mg alloys [16,17]. 
In our proposed electroplating process, an activated surface is generated on a Mg 
alloy via galvanostatic etching in an alkaline Cu-plating bath. Cu electroplating is 
performed immediately after galvanostatic etching in the same alkaline Cu-plating 
bath. Then the Cu-deposited Mg alloy can be further electroplated in acidic Cu and Ni 
baths to achieve a Ni/Cu protective coating.    
 Based on our previous experimental results, in this work we attempted to 
electroplate a Cu deposit on AZ91D with an eco-friendly electroplating process. 
Furthermore, trivalent Cr electrodeposition was conducted on Cu-deposited AZ91D to 
improve its wear and corrosion resistance. The wear resistance, corrosion resistance, 
hardness and bonding strength were evaluated for Cu-deposited and Cr/Cu-deposited 
AZ91D specimens.

carried out. The test was accomplished by scratching six 1-mm-wide parallel lines 
with a diamond knife in both longitudinal and latitudinal directions on the surfaces of 
Cu- and Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D specimens. Subsequently, 3M tape (3 M Core Series 
4-1000) was adhered to the scratched specimen for ca. 60 s, and then the tape was 
vertically and rapidly peeled off from the deposited surface. According to the ASTM 
D3359-02 standard, bonding strength can be divided into 6 classes, namely from class 
0 to class 5. Specimens in the higher classes have higher bonding strength.  
The corrosion behavior of the deposited AZ91D specimen was evaluated in an 
electrochemical three-electrode cell by means of the anodic polarization test in 0.1 M 
H2SO4 solution at 27oC. The deposited specimen was used as a working electrode. A 
plantized Ti mesh and an Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl solution were used as 
counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The anodic polarization behavior of the 
Cu- and Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D specimens was evaluated by potentiodynamic 
scanning with a scan rate of 5 mVs-1 from -0.25 V (vs. open circuit potential) in the 
noble potential direction until breakdown of the deposit.  
The hardness values of AZ91D substrate, Cu and as-plated and flame-heated Cr 
deposits were measured with a micro-hardness tester (Matsuzawa Digital, Model 
MXT-α7e) using a 50 g load. Mean hardness and its standard deviation for a specimen 
were calculated according to ten measurements. The wear resistance of Cu- and 
Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D specimens was evaluated with a ball-on-plate wear tester in 
which a 5 mm steel-ball counterpart with a hardness value of ca. 450 Hv was utilized. 
A constant load of 10 N was applied normally to the Cu- or Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D 
specimen under unlubricated condition at 25 °C. Each wear resistance testing was 
conducted with a circular track of 3 mm in diameter, a frequency of 10 Hz and a total 
sliding distance of 50 m. The wear resistance of a specimen was evaluated from its 
weight-loss value after wear test.

of the through-deposit cracks, trivalent Cr-deposited specimens have comparatively 
bad corrosion resistance. However, we have demonstrated that a Ni undercoat 
between the trivalent Cr deposit and the steel substrate significantly reduces the crack 
density and even narrows the cracks developed in the trivalent Cr deposit [21], which 
can be attributed to removal of internal stress, to a degree. In this study, we found the 
same effect for Cu as that of a Ni undercoat in reducing crack density of the trivalent 
Cr deposit, as relatively few and narrow cracks were found in the trivalent Cr deposit 
when it was electroplated on a Cu-deposited AZ91D substrate. Therefore, it can be 
expected that the Cr/Cu deposit has relatively high corrosion resistance because no 
through-deposit cracks are observed in the trivalent Cr deposit. 
 
3.2 Bonding strength and hardness tests 
As expected, a very good bonding strength was detected between the Cu deposit 
and the AZ91D substrate, as can be seen in Fig. 4(a) in which the Cu-deposited 
AZ91D is estimated to be of class 5 according to the ASTM D3359-02 standard. 
However, a slight decrease of bonding strength for the Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D 
specimen was observed, as presented in Fig. 4 (b). There were a few positions with 
detached deposits along cut marks after peeling the adhesive tape from the specimen. 
According to the ASTM D3359-02 standard, the bonding strength of Cr/Cu-deposited 
AZ91D lay between class 3 and class 4, which is also good enough for applications 
[22].   
Fig. 5 shows the hardness values of AZ91D, the Cu deposit, and the as-plated and 
flame-heated Cr deposits. The hardness of AZ91D was 90 Hv and that of the Cu 
deposit was 180 Hv. A hardness of 740 Hv was detected for the as-plated trivalent Cr 
deposit; furthermore, the trivalent Cr deposit obtained a very high hardness of 1100 
Hv after reduction-flame heating for 0.5 s. The experimental results show that the

The surface morphologies of Cu-, as-plated Cr/Cu-, and flame-hardened 
Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D specimens after the wear test are shown in Figs. 7-9. Fig. 7(a) 
and (b) show the unground and ground surfaces of Cu-deposited AZ91D in optical 
and SEM images. Unsurprisingly, deeply ground marks in a circular track can be 
clearly seen on the surface of the Cu-deposited AZ91D specimen after the wear test. 
Fig. 7(c) and (d) show the results of EDS analyses on areas A and B, which 
correspond to the unground and ground portions of Cu-deposited AZ91D, respectively. 
In the analysis of the unground area A, the only element detected was Cu; in contrast, 
in the analysis of ground area B only Mg was observed, which means that the Cu 
deposit was fully worn away from the AZ91D surface after the wear test. That is, 
Cu-deposited AZ91D has low wear resistance.         
Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the ground surfaces of the as-plated Cr/Cu-deposited AZ9D 
specimen after the wear test. As presented in the optical image in Fig. 8(a), more than 
half of the Cr-deposited surface had a nodular morphology, similar to the as-plated Cr 
deposit. There were no observable deeply ground surfaces and the ground tracks did 
not seem to be continuous. An EDS analysis at position A in Fig. 8(b) on the nodular 
surface showed a chemical composition consisting mainly of Cr with a minor amount 
of Fe [see Fig. 8(c)]. In contrast, the results of EDS analysis on the ground track at 
position B in Fig. 8(b) showed that more abundant Fe was detected, as shown in Fig. 
8(d). Because the hardness of the as-plated Cr deposit was higher than that of steel, 
the Fe detected on the surface of Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D must be from the steel 
counterpart. That is, the ground track in the Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D is the 
cold-welded steel ball. Consequently, the as-plated Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D specimen 
had a high wear resistance. As presented in the optical image in Fig. 9(a), more than 
half of the surface of the flame-hardened Cr after the wear test was ground tracks, 
which means much more cold-welded or worn steel ball was observed. The

-0.15 V and a corrosion current density of 4.2 x 10-6 Acm-2 when it was further 
electroplated in an acidic Cu-plating bath. Although the Cu-deposited AZ91D 
specimen had a low corrosion current density, it could be easily oxidized in the 
atmosphere [25]. Therefore, trivalent Cr electrodeposition was used as a protective 
coating for AZ91D owing to its high oxidation resistance. The corrosion current 
density of Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D was also in the range of a few 10-6 Acm-2. Similar 
results for an anti-corrosion coating for Mg alloy specimens have been reported by 
several researchers [26,27], who also used an anti-corrosion coating as the final 
electroplating process to increase the corrosion resistance of the Mg alloy.  The 
corrosion potential of as-plated Cr/Cu-deposited AZ91D was -0.27 and shifted to 
-0.15 V after flame heating. That is, trivalent Cr electrodeposition could act as an 
anti-corrosion coating for AZ91D.
