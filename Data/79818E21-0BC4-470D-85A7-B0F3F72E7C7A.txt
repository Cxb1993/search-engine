一、 摘要 
傳統以氮化鋁/矽為結構之表面聲波元
件，其輸入訊號容易被矽基板所損耗，所以
目前的表面聲波元件都是採用昂貴的單晶
基板，而使得單價偏高；因此本研究利用微
機電之背部蝕刻的方式，減少能量在矽基板
上的損耗。本研究將致力於此一新型態的表

二、 計畫緣由與目的 
所謂「RFID(無線射頻識別，Radio 
Frequency Identification)」，就是利用「非接
觸方式」來讀取資料的技術。而依照使用的
頻率高低，RFID 分成多種不同的適用距
離。 
RFID 被認為是影響未來全球產業發展
的重要技術，甚至被列為本世紀十大重要技
術項目之一，並具有非常高的產業價值。依
據元件本身是否具有能源，可以概分主動式
與被動式二大類。所謂 RFID 是由標籤
(Tag)、讀取器(Reader)和天線(Antenna)三部
分組成的非接觸式自動識別技術。而目前
RFID 技術已漸進地應用在零售應用中，未
來將可取代現有的條碼(Bar code)。 
本 計 畫 擬 以 微 機 電 系 統 (Micro 
electromechanical systems, MEMS)的蝕刻技

背蝕型 RFID 元件之製作。 
此外，若能將 SAW-Based RFID 製程完
全的移植到以矽基板為主之 IC 製程，則可
望搭配 MEMS 技術所製作的微制動器開
關，完成可程式化 RFID 單石化(Monolithic) 
之目標。而藉由 MEMS 技術將機械結構和
電子線路整合，使產品造價降低且品質均
一，且更可縮小成品尺寸，增高精度，因此
本計畫所擬發展的背蝕型 SAW-Based RFID
對於射頻辨識元件的Monolithic發展將是相
當重要的關鍵。

Abstract 
In this paper, solidly mounted resonators (SMRs) consisting of single layer of aluminum 
nitride (AlN) piezoelectric thin film and varying numbers of multi-layered molybdenum 
(Mo)/titanium (Ti) thin films had been developed and researched on fabrication, analysis, and 
frequency response issues. For the frequency applications of 2.5 GHz, specific thicknesses of AlN, 
Mo, and Ti were considered in the thin film deposition processes. Because it is the multilayer that 
constitutes the structure, the flatness of each layer would be the critical issue in fabricating SMRs. 
The roughness of the thin films was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the 
cross-section of the structure was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
Manufacture parameters of thin films in the sputtering system, such as deposition power, 
temperature and pressure, were adjusted in accordance with the results of AFM and SEM. With the 
optimal deposition power of 200 W, temperature of 400к and pressure of 5 mTorr, the roughness 
of four pairs Mo/Ti can be reduced to 13.9 nm. Various numbers of Mo/Ti pairs were made to 
clarify its effects on the resonance response of SMR. The SMR devices showed the distinct resonant 
phenomenon near 2.31 GHz and an excellent noise restraint. The more numbers of Mo/Ti pair, the 
better signal return loss was obtained. The experimental results revealed that the Mo/Ti Bragg 
reflector has a good ability to restrain acoustic dissipation caused by the substrate, and is suitable 
for the fabrication of SMR devices.

The basic structure of thin film bulk acoustic wave resonators consists of a single layer of 
aluminum nitride (AlN) piezoelectric thin film sandwiched between two metal electrodes, which is 
in turn mounted to the substrate. In terms of methodology, there are two types of TFBARs that trap 
acoustic wave energy and isolate the resonator from the substrate. The first structure utilizes an air 
cave beneath the resonator configuration, constructed by removing a portion of silicon substrate or 
sacrificed layer with either bulk or surface micromachining [3-5]. The other structure is the 
so-called solidly mounted resonator (SMR), demonstrated by Newell in 1965 [6], which is 
composed of piezoelectric AlN thin film sandwiched between two electrodes and a Bragg reflector 
consisting of alternating high and low acoustic impedance layers of quarter-wavelength thickness 
[7-12]. In addition, the greater high and low impedance ratio of the Bragg reflector, the better the 
transform efficiency will be yielded. The function of the Bragg reflector is to transfer the impedance 
of the interface between the resonator and Bragg reflector to a higher or lower value, thereby 
producing partial isolation. In the SMR configuration, the top surface has a normal air interface 
while the bottom interface is solidly mounted through a Bragg reflector structure to the substrate. 
Furthermore, the interface between the resonator and Bragg reflector may present a clamped or free 
interface depending on the detailed arrangement of the reflector layers. 
The most significant advantage of the SMR resonator, compared to other TFBARs devices, is 
that the resonance response is nearly independent of the type of the substrate used. SMR can be 
fabricated over various substrates, such as silicon (Si), galinium arsenide (GaAs) and glass 
substrates, so that it has good compatibility with high frequency Si or GaAs integrated circuit 
manufacturing processes. Moreover, the resonance responses show an excellent noise restraint and 
an absence of spurious effect. Furthermore, the SMR structure is more robust than other membrane 
resonators owing to the absence of the air cave. For this reason, the robust construction gives a 
higher device yield during fabrication. Due to the fact, however, that SMR comprises multiple 
layers of high and low acoustic impedance, the flatness of each layer of thin film is the critical issue

With the completion of the Bragg reflector, the experimental procedure was followed by 
fabricating a resonator configuration consisting of one layer of piezoelectric thin film sandwiched 
between two layers of metal electrodes. To begin, Mo thin film was deposited onto Bragg reflector, 
and patterned using photolithography and lift-off techniques to form the bottom electrode. Then, an 
AlN piezoelectric layer was deposited on the bottom electrode layer with half-wavelength (Ȝ/2) 
thickness of the resonance frequency using reactive RF magnetron sputtering system. The reactive 
RF sputtering system consists of a simple chamber with a water-cooled 99.999 % pure aluminum 
target disk of 3 inches in diameter. After the chamber was evacuated to below 4ͪ10-6 Torr, 
high-purity argon gas (Ar, 99.999 %) controlled by a mass flow controller (MFC) was introduced 
into the chamber. The RF power and chamber pressure were maintained at 365 watt and 10 mTorr 
to presputter one half hour in order to clean the target surface before film deposition. After 
presputtering, a fixed total gas flow of 7.5 sccm with various ratios of argon gas to nitrogen gas (N2, 
99.999 %) controlled by MFCs was introduced into the chamber, and the substrate was heated to the 
desired temperature. Next, the RF power and the sputtering pressure were adjusted to the desired 
values for thin film deposition. Finally, Al thin film was deposited onto the piezoelectric thin film, 
and patterned using photolithography and lift-off techniques to form the top electrode. Table I 
shows the typical deposition conditions for Mo, Ti and AlN thin films. 
It is well known that the surface roughness of the interface between the Bragg reflector and 
resonator has significant effects on the resonance characteristics and the isolation of acoustic wave 
energy. Therefore, AFM (TopoMetrix S/NǺEX139710) was employed to determinate the surface 
roughness and grain size. The AFM illustrations with a scanning area of 25 ȝm2 were obtained by 
means of the tapping mode. The surface morphologies and the cross-section configurations of thin 
films were observed via SEM (PHILIPS XL-40FEG). Finally, a HP 8720ET network analyzer was 
adopted to measure the electromagnetic wave reflection coefficient (S11) of the fabricated SMR 
device to demonstrate the performance of the Bragg reflector.

of high and low acoustic impedance (Zh/Zl) and the number of thin film layers should be as large as 
possible. In this study, Mo and Ti were employed as the materials of high and low acoustic 
impedance, since they had the advantages of quite large acoustic impedance ratio, conspicuous 
interfaces between high and low acoustic impedance layers, flat surface morphologies and the 
absence of parasitically electric capacity.  
Both Mo and Ti thin film layers were deposited alternately with the optimal deposition power 
of 200 watt, temperature of 400к and pressure of 5 mTorr to form interfaces with low surface 
roughness, avoiding scattering of acoustic wave energy. Figure 2 shows the top-viewed and the 
cross-sectional SEM images of the Bragg reflector with two, three and four pairs of Mo/Ti thin film 
layers. It can be noted that the top view shows a flat and smooth surface morphology, and the cross 
section displays clear and distinct interfaces. Figure 3 shows the AFM images of the Bragg reflector 
with two, three and four pairs of Mo/Ti thin film layers, which reveals the surface roughness of root 
mean square (Rrms), analyzed with a scanning area of 25 ȝm2. Although the reflecting layers 
increase from four layers to eight layers, the surface roughness of Bragg reflector presents only a 
slight rise from 9.6nm to 13.9 nm, according to Fig. 3. 
The input reflection coefficient (S11) of these SMR devices were measured using an HP 
8720ET network analyzer and Cascade probes station along with a GSG-type probe. As shown in 
Fig. 4(a), the distinct resonant phenomenon near 2.31 GHz as well as excellent noise restraint was 
exhibited with various pairs of Mo/Ti thin film layers. The frequency response of two-pair Mo/Ti 
layers exhibits a return loss of 3.96 dB and a zero insertion loss at the center frequency of 2.39 GHz, 
whereas it shows an additional resonance around 1.2 GHz because of the shear mode resonance. 
Three pairs of Mo/Ti thin film layers present an increased return loss of 9.58 dB at the center 
frequency of 2.03 GHz, and the resonance response also shows a zero insertion loss and excellent 
noise restraint. The Bragg reflector with four-pair Mo/Ti thin film layers shows a further increased 
return loss of 16.7 dB at the center frequency of 2.31 GHz. Figure 4(b) exhibits the Smith chart of

Introduction 
The increase in the operating frequencies of wireless communication systems has motivated 
the development of high-frequency, low-cost microelectronic filters by standard technological 
processes. The film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) has become one of the most promising 
components for realizing microwave monolithic integrated circuits, especially in high-frequency 
passive devices used in GHz-band wireless communication systems[1,2]. The quality of an FBAR 
component depends on the piezoelectric material and the physical characteristics of bottom 
electrode material, such as the sheet resistance, roughness and crystalline [3]. The most important 
factor that determines the characteristics of the piezoelectric film is considered to be its preferred 
orientation. ZnO thin films have been adopted as piezoelectric layers in the fabrication of high-Q 
FBAR devices, which must have a strong c-axis preferred orientation (rocking curve, ı <6o) and a 
high electrical resistivity (>106 ȍcm). The high bulk velocity and compatibility with standard Si 
fabrication technologies have caused ZnO to become one of the most promising materials for 
fabricating film bulk acoustics resonators (FBARs)[4,5,6].  
The selection of the bottom electrode metal is important because its physical characteristics 
will affect the growth behavior of the following deposition of piezoelectric film, and thus determine 
the quality of the piezoelectric film. Pt is preferred as the material of the bottom electrode for FBAR  
device because of its physical properties, such as low sheet resistance and lattice constant matching 
with ZnO[7]. However, few exhaustive studies have addressed the effects of the bottom electrode 
 
2 The 3rd Intl. Conf. on Technological Advances of Thin Films & Surface Coatings – THINFILMS 2006
respectively. The piezoelectric thin film was deposited by RF magnetron sputtering, and the 
deposition parameters were shown in Table 1. The thickness of the ZnO film is set to around 1ȝm. 
The preferred orientation and crystalline characteristics of the ZnO films were evaluated by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) using a SHIMADZU XRD-6000 with CuKĮ radiation. Multi-layered 
cross-sections of the grain structures of the ZnO films were observed by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). The surface roughness of the electrode and piezoelectric layer was measured by 
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The electrical resistance of the bottom electrode with a Ti seeding 
layer was measured using the van der Pauw four point probe method. 
Results and Discussion 
Figure 1(a) depicts the surface topography of the Pt thin film deposited on SiNx without a Ti 
seeding layer. The roughness is determined to be 10 nm by AFM 3-D scanning. The surface 
morphology of the rough electrode leads to the bad crystallization of the subsequently deposited 
ZnO film. 
Figures 1(b) and 1(c) present the surface roughness of Pt thin films deposited on SiNx/Si with 
Ti seeding layers of thicknesses of 12 nm and 50 nm, respectively. As presented in Fig. 2, the 
surface roughness of Pt film is least as the thickness of Ti seeding layer is 12 nm. A thicker seeding 
layer does not correspond to a lower surface roughness. The results revealed that a Ti seeding layer 
can be a nucleus of Pt growth and improve the adhesion between Pt and SiNx. In the FBAR 
 
4 The 3rd Intl. Conf. on Technological Advances of Thin Films & Surface Coatings – THINFILMS 2006
such as ZnO are believed to exhibit a piezoelectricity of unity in the (002)-preferring orientation. 
Uniform piezoelectrity can improve the efficiency of energy transfer. Moreover, the longitudinal 
wave velocity (VL) is given by, 
U
33CVL  , ................................................................................................... (2) 
where C33 andʳӹ are the stiffness modulus in the z direction and the mass density, respectively[11]. 
As ZnO thin film exhibits better orientation and denser texture, C33 will increase, and the quality of 
the resonator will increase. 
Conclusion 
Each constituent of a thin-film bulk acoustic wave resonator has a particular effect or 
influence on the overall performance. The bottom electrode, a simple electrical connection, can be 
modified by adding a Ti seeding layer on substrate. Excellent electrical characteristics of 150 nm Pt 
electrode can be obtained using a 12 nm-thick Ti seeding layer. Not only an electrode with a low 
sheet resistance and a smooth surface is prepared, but also the ZnO thin film with a strong c-axis 
orientation is obtained. This thin film will contribute significantly to the piezoelectricity of the 
resonator. Therefore, combining a Pt bottom electrode with a Ti seeding layer will improve the 
performance of ZnO FBAR devices.

Abstract 
A solidly mounted resonator (SMR) consists of a multi-layered structure and requires 
material interfaces that confine waves to resonate as standing waves in order to avoid wave 
energy loss. The selection of high or low acoustic impedance for the first layer beneath 
piezoelectric layer results in ¼Ȝ mode and ½ Ȝ mode resonance configurations. 
In this study, Mo/SiO2 is chosen to construct the Bragg reflector as the high/low 
acoustic impedance materials, respectively, and aluminum nitride (AlN) is used as the 
piezoelectric layer. For application at frequency of 2.5 GHz, the specific thicknesses of Mo, 
SiO2, and AlN are considered individually in the deposition processes. AlN of ¼ Ȝ 
thickness is deposited on a seven-layer Bragg reflector. The ¼ Ȝ mode SMR shows the 
distinct resonant characteristics at 1.3 GHz and 2.4 GHz. The coupling coefficient Keff2 of 
6.9% is in agreement with the theoretical analysis.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Due to the demands for high frequency wireless communication, thin film bulk 
acoustic wave (TFBAW) devices, such as resonators, filters, duplexers, and oscillators, 
hold much promise in the field of RF microelectronics [1-5]. It is the bulk acoustic wave 
1
another possibility in that a certain number of layers can be taken as a clamped surface as 
well. Kanbara’s research defined the ¼ Ȝ mode configuration in an SMR with a one-side 
clamped surface [10]. In the acoustic reflecting structure, high/low acoustic impedance 
materials in one quarter acoustic wavelength thin films are successively stacked onto the 
substrate to maintain the required resonant boundary conditions—clamped or free 
interfaces, depending on the arrangements of these multilayers. The formation of 
multilayer thin films is similar to the Bragg reflector used in semiconductor laser devices, 
therefore it is also termed here as a Bragg reflector [11, 12]. The Bragg reflector 
transforms the impedance of the substrate to a near zero or infinite value in order to avoid 
wave energy dissipation into the substrate. The impedance value of the substrate is zero or 
infinite depending on the selection of low or high acoustic impedance material for the first 
layer beneath the piezoelectric material, respectively. With the two different equivalent 
acoustic impedances, two possible mode configurations of resonance exist: ½ Ȝ mode and 
¼ Ȝ mode configurations.  
Most TFBAW researches are devoted to the study of ½ Ȝ mode configuration devices, 
which possess slightly higher Keff values than ¼ Ȝ mode devices according to theoretical 
calculation [10]. However, for ¼ Ȝ mode devices, a piezoelectric layer of only half the 
thickness of ½ Ȝ mode ones is required. The thinner the piezoelectric film, the less 
deposition time and stress. Therefore, few cases of thin film cracking and a high yield rate 
are expected. In this paper, the frequency responses of SMR devices with ¼Ȝ mode 
configuration using Mo/SiO2 (Molybdenum/Silicon dioxide) Bragg reflector are 
investigated and discussed thoroughly.

(Philips XL40 FE-SEM, Eindhoven, Netherlands). Manufacture parameters of thin films 
in the sputtering system, such as deposition temperature and pressure, were adjusted in 
accordance with the results of XRD, AFM, and SEM. To investigate the frequency 
response, devices were measured with the HP 8720ET network analyzer (Agilent, Palo 
Alto, CA). The absolute admittance Y was calculated from the following relationship:

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The analysis of a SMR structure is carried out by a recursion transmission line

where Zin is the input impedance, Zt the load impedance, and Z0 the characteristic 
impedance [8]. Thus the impedance of the Bragg reflector can be calculated by Eq. (3) in 
terms of Zh, Zl, and Zs, where subscripts s, h, and l indicate the substrate, high, and low 
acoustic impedance, respectively [10]. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the input impedance seen 
from the top of Bragg reflector can be expressed as

surface. In addition, the surface roughness decreases with an increase in substrate 
temperature (Fig. 3(b)). The sputtered particles hold more kinetic energy under higher 
temperature, which benefits nucleation and grain growth. Therefore, the atoms arrange 
compactly to form a smoother thin film surface. With the optimal deposition power and 
temperature of 200W and 400к for Mo and 150W and 300к for SiO2, the cross-sectional 
image and surface morphology of seven Mo/SiO2 layers is smooth, as shown in Fig. 4. The 
smooth and clear interfaces of a Bragg reflector are important criteria for SMR devices. 
Owing to its excellent piezoelectric properties, aluminum nitride (AlN) has been used 
for the piezoelectric layer. The highly c-axis oriented AlN thin film on Mo electrode is 
evaluated usingʳĬ-2ĬʳXRD. The AlN (002) diffraction peak corresponding to the crystal 
plane occurring at 2Ĭ=36° was observed, as shown in Fig. 5. The thickness of AlN film of 
1.04ȝm is in accordance with ¼ Ȝ at 2.5 GHz. After device construction, the RMS surface 
roughness of <14nm was measured on top of the SMR, as shown in Fig. 6. Surface 
roughness is always dependent on thickness. For a ¼ Ȝ mode device, a piezoelectric layer 
with only half the thickness of a ½ Ȝ mode one is required. Therefore, smoother thin films 
result in less scattering loss and better high-frequency response. 
The results of frequency responses, S11, and the Smith chart are shown in Fig. 7. The 
experimental results show a distinct resonance phenomenon around 2.4 GHz and 1.3 GHz 
and excellent noise restraint. This reveals that bulk acoustic waves are resonant at ¼ Ȝ 
mode configuration. The Bragg reflector exhibits highly enough acoustic impedance to 
successfully clamp the acoustic wave. We do not consider electrodes in our calculation; the 
resulting standing waves resonate between a clamped interface caused by Mo and a free 
interface caused by the air to form quarter-wave resonance in the piezoelectric layer. In
