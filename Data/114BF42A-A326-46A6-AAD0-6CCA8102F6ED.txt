Abstract 
Because of large specific surface area, micropore volume, and short adsorption equilibrium 
time, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have great potential in adsorption applications such as hydrogen 
storage, sensor, and removals of trace contaminants.  Benzene and toluene were used as 
adsorbates in this work to study the influences of functional groups of aromatic compounds on 
the interaction between them and CNTs.  Adsorption of benzene by CNTs was conducted at 
different temperatures to understand the thermodynamic.  The adsorption of benzene by CNTs 
is endothermic, which is similar to that by many other adsorbents. It was found that adsorption of 
toluene, which has an electron donating methyl group, was not affected by solution pH.   
However, solution pH has some effects on the adsorption capacity of CNTs of benzene, which 
has no functional groups.       
Keywords: carbon nanotubes, adsorption, aromatic compounds. 
 
1. Introduction 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), a new member of the carbon family, have attracted many 
researchers since Iijima’s observation in 1991. CNTs have many excellent properties and have 
various applications in field emission, nanodevices, gas adsorption, and catalyst support. Their 
large specific surface area, micropore volume, and short adsorption equilibrium time all suggest 
CNTs are ideal sorbents.  
Lu and Chiu[1] reported that SWCNTs and MWCNTs purified by sodium hypochlorite 
solutions have high adsorption capacities for zinc(Ⅱ). The lead adsorption capacities of CNTs 
increased greatly after acid oxidation[2]. The mechanism of adsorption for organic compound is 
more complicated. The polarity, structure, and size of organic molecules all affect the results of 
adsorption. Lu et al.[3] have found that the short equilibrium time and high adsorption capacity 
for CHCl3, which accounts for a significant portion of THMs. This suggests that CNTs possess 
great potential in application in the removal of THMs. The adsorption capacity of CNTs was 
about double of that of powdered activated carbon (PAC) since the small molecule, CHCl3, was 
more preferentially adsorbed onto CNTs. Besides, oxygen-containing surface groups were 
introduced on the surface of the CNTs after acid treatment, which made CNTs became more 
suitable for adsorption of relatively polar THMs molecules. The adsorption capacity of CNTs for 
1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) fluctuated less in the pH range of 3-10, but decreased when pH 
exceeds 10. Because the ionization of the oxygen-containing surface groups on the surface of the 
CNTs retains water molecules by hydrogen bonding. The formation of water clusters hinders the 
adsorption of DCB. Heating of CNTs can reduce the oxygen groups [4]. The CNTs was rolled up 
with single or multiple saturated layer of graphite and the π-π interaction between of graphite and 
aromatic molecules is strong [5]. When benzene was adsorbed on CNTs, because of overlapping 
of π electron between CNTs and benzene, the electrical property was changed [6]. 
Chin et al. [7] used SWCNTs before and after acid oxidation to adsorb o-xylene and p-xylene 
molecules. The results showed that the adsorption of o-xylene was significantly influenced by 
solution pH after the CNTs were oxidized.  The adsorption amount of SWCNTs for o-xylene

The adsorption–desorption of N2 on the SWCNTs at 77K conducted to determine the surface 
area and micropore volume, which are given in Table 1.  It is cleared that surface area is mainly 
external. The adsorption and desorption isotherms are also given in Figure 3. The adsorption 
isotherm for SWCNTs is type  and the adsorⅣ ption shows hysteresis. This implies there are 
many micropore on SWCNTs, which were introduced by opening the end caps of the SWCNTs 
during purification by the manufactures.  Figure 4 shows that there is no surface group on the 
surface of the SWCNTS, as analyzed by FTIR.

q stands for the quantity of adsorption in equilibrium concentration (mg/g), b is the Langmuir 
adsorption constant, and Ce and qm are equilibrium concentration (mg/L ) and saturated quantity of 
monolayer adsorption (mg/g), respectively. Adsorption isotherms of benzene adsorbed by SWCNTs 
at 293 K , 303 K, and 313 K are presented in Figure 6 and the thermodynamic parameters are listed 
in Table 2. The capacity of SWCNTs for benzene decreases with increasing temperature. Also, the 
decrease in the adsorption capacity from 293 K to 303 K is more obvious than that from 303 K to 
313 K. It is probably because that benzene is a volatile compound under regular temperature.  
When the temperature was raised from 293 K to 303 K, the solution was heated and the volatility 
was significantly increased.  While the temperature was raised from 303 K to 313 K, the increase 
in the volatility of benzene was limited.
