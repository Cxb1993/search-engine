Seasunnano Pro. Co. (Nanjing, China). Sulfuric acid (96%), 
nitric acid (61%), thionyl chloride, ethylene glycol, 
1,3-propanediol, dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), and acrylic acid 
(AA) were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, 
WI). The AA was purified before use by recrystallization from 
chloroform. The initiator used in this study was benzoyl 
peroxide (BPO; Aldrich Chemical Co.), which was purified by 
dissolution in chloroform and reprecipitation in methanol. Other 
reagents were purified using conventional methods.  
Synthesis of PTT 
The DMT, 1,3-propanediol (PDO) and Sn(C7H15COO)2 
were mixed and autocalved by a weight ratio of 2:1:0.0005, 
respectively. Excess PDO (10wt%) was added to drive the 
reaction to completion and Sn(C7H15COO)2 was added as a 
catalyst. The reaction mixture was heated to 190–200oC for 12h 
and stirred under a mild stream of nitrogen to generate an 
ester-interchange reaction. In theory, over 95% of the methanol 
should be released during the reaction process, resulting in the 
formation of bis-hydroxypropyl terephthalate. The mixture was 
then heated to 220–230oC for 2 h and the pressure was gradually 
reduced to less than 1 Torr to remove excess PDO. The 
polycondensation reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 h with 
continual removal of the PDO by-product. Molecular weigth 
(Mw) of PTT is 3.36 × 104 estimated by Gel permeation 
chromatograpgy. 
Grafting reaction and sample preparation 
A mixture of AA and BPO was added in four equal portions 
at 2-minute intervals to molten PTT to allow grafting to take 
place. The reactions were carried out under a nitrogen 
atmosphere at 45±2°C. Preliminary experiments showed that 
reaction equilibrium was attained in less than 10 hours, and 
reactions were therefore allowed to progress for 10 hours, at a 
rotor speed of 60rpm. The product (4g) was dissolved in 200mL 
of refluxing CF3COOD/CDCl3 (80/20, v/v) at 45±2°C and the 
solution was then filtered through several layers of cheesecloth. 
The CF3COOD/CDCl3-soluble product in the filtrate was 
extracted five times, using 600mL of cold acetone for each 
extraction. 
Determination of grafting percentage 
Via a titration method, the acrylic acid loading of the 
CF3COOD/CDCl3-soluble polymer was calculated from the acid 
number and the result was expressed as the grafting percentage. 
About 2 grams of copolymer was heated for 2 hours in 200Ml of 
refluxing CF3COOD/CDCl3. This solution was then titrated 
immediately with a 0.03N ethanolic KOH solution, which had 
been standardized against a solution of potassium hydrogen 
phthalate, with phenolphthalein used as an indicator. The acid 
number and the grafting percentage could then be calculated 
using the following equations:31 
Acid  number(mgKOH/g)＝VKOH(mL) ×CKOH(N) ×56.1∕polymer(g) 
Grafting  percentage(%)＝(Acid number×72∕2×561) ×100% 
With BPO loading and AA loading kept at 0.3wt% and 10wt%, 
respectively, the percentage grafting was determined as 
5.52wt%. 
Preparation of MWNT–OH 
The modification of MWNT and PTT and the preparation of 
nanocomposite blends are illustrated in Scheme 1. 
Approximately 500 mg of crude MWNTs was stirred in 30 mL 
of a concentrated H2SO4/HNO3 (1:3) mixture at 50–60oC for 40 
min to oxidatively generate carboxyl functional groups. During 
this process, the MWNT volume expanded several-fold, 
suggesting that many of the MWNT bundles were exfoliated 
into individual nanotubes.32 MWNTs with pendant carbonyl 
chloride groups (MWNT–COCl) were obtained by refluxing 
thionyl chloride with the acid-treated samples (MWNT–COOH) 
at 0–5oC for 24 h. The conversion of carboxylic acids into acid 
chlorides was accompanied by the formation of gaseous SO2 and 
HCl. SO2 was continuously removed to lower the extent of the 
reverse reaction. After the reaction was complete, unreacted 
SOCl2 was evaporated with a rotary evaporator, and the 
MWNT–COCl samples were dried in a vacuum oven overnight. 
MWNT–COCl samples were highly reactive and kept isolated 
from ambient air to prevent unintentional hydrolysis of the 
−COCl groups into carboxylate ions. MWNT–COCl was reacted 
with ethylene glycol at 110–120oC for 24 h to yield 
hydroxyl-functionalized MWNTs (MWNT–OH). MWNT–OH 
was separated by vacuum filtration through a 0.22-μm 
polycarbonate membrane filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and 
subsequently washed with anhydrous xylene. After repeated 
washing and filtration steps, the solid MWNT−OH was dried 
overnight in a vacuum oven.  
Preparation of hybrids 
Blends were prepared using a “Plastograph” 200 Nm 
W50EHT mixer with a blade-type rotor (C.W. Brabender 
Instruments, Inc., Hackensack, NJ). Prior to blending, MWNT 
and MWNT−OH samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 60oC 
for 2 days. Blends of PTT/MWNT or PTT-g-AA/MWNT−OH 
hybrid blends were prepared with 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 wt% 
inorganic filler. About 20 g of mixture (polymer and filler) was 
mixed at 50 rpm and 220–230oC for 30 min with a Sb2O3 
catalyst. For PTT-g-AA/MWNT−OH, the blended mixture was 
then placed in a vacuum oven at 105oC for 8 h to continue the 
esterification reaction between PTT-g-AA and MWNT–OH. 
Standard specimens were prepared by pressing the hybrid blends 
into plates 1 mm thick using a hydrolytic press at 220oC and 100 
atm. After pressing, the plates were placed in a dryer for cooling. 
Prior to characterization, the specimens were conditioned at a 
relative humidity of 50 ± 5% for 24 h. 
Characterizations of hybrid blends 
Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR; FTS-7PC 
type; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used to investigate the 
grafting reaction of AA onto PTT and to verify ester bond 
formation between the MWNT−OH phase and the PTT matrix. 
Samples subjected to FTIR analysis were ground into fine 
powders in a milling machine and pressed into pellets with KBr. 
Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses 
were performed with an AMX 400 13C NMR spectrometer 
(Bruker, Madison, WI) at 100 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were 
acquired under cross-polarization and magic angle sample 
spinning. Power decoupling was employed with a 90o pulse and 
4 s cycle time. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra 
were recorded on a UV2001-PC spectrophotometer (Hitachi, 
Tokyo, Japan). Glass transition (Tg) and melting temperatures 
(Tm) were determined using a 2010 DSC system (TA 
Instruments, New Castle, DE). Sample sizes ranged from 4 to 6 
mg and melting curves were obtained between –30oC and 250oC 
at a heating rate of 10oC/min. The values of Tg and Tm were 
determined from the temperature and area of melting peaks in 
the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) heating 
thermograms. A thermogravimetric analyzer (2010 TGA; TA 
Instruments) was used to assess whether organic–inorganic 
phase interactions influenced thermal degradation in hybrid 
samples. Samples were placed in alumina crucibles and 
subjected to a thermal ramp from 30oC to 500oC at a heating rate 
of 20oC/min. Initial decomposition temperatures (IDTs) were 
obtained at the shoulder of the mass loss (TG%) curve. To 
obtain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs, 
samples were mounted in epoxy resin and sliced on a microtome 
to create specimens of 60–100 nm thickness. Micrographs were 
acquired with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-100CX 
II; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. In 
accordance with method ASTM D638, an Instron mechanical 
tester (Model Lloyd, LR5K type; Segensworth, Fareham, UK) 
was used to measure the tensile strength and strain at break 
using a 20 mm/min crosshead speed. Five measurements were 
4 
 
hybrid blends was a result of ester formation between the 
hydroxyl groups of MWNT–OH and the carboxylic acid groups 
of PTT-g-AA, which hindered the relative motion of the 
polymer chains. 
Variation of Tg for MWNT–OH loading above 1 wt% was 
somewhat less than that below 1 wt%. This may have been due 
to low grafting percentages in the PTT-g-AA copolymer (about 
5.52 wt%) since Tg is dependent on the number of carboxylate 
groups in the copolymer matrix that are available to bind with 
hydroxyl groups on MWNT–OH.42 At greater than 1 wt% 
MWNT–OH, the carboxylate groups of PTT-g-AA were 
effectively saturated and the excess nanotubes physically 
dispersed in the polymer matrix without a chemical interaction. 
Excess MWNT–OH might have induced separation of the 
organic and inorganic phases by lowering compatibility, 
resulting in a slightly enhanced Tg. 
Figure 6 also shows a marked decrease in Tm with 
increasing MWNT–OH content up to 1 wt%, above which the 
Tm increase slightly again. The decrease in the Tm of 
PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH was likely caused by inhibited polymer 
motion, which would prohibit the chain arrangement and 
reorganization required for solidification. Whilst the increase of 
Tm at content above 1 wt% was caused by the aggregation of 
excess MWNT–OH. Tg and Tm of the PTT/MWNT and 
PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH hybrid materials were also summarized 
in Table 1. As expected, both PTT/MWNT and 
PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH exhibited higher Tgs than pure PTT. 
The enhancement in Tg was greater in PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH 
than in PTT/MWNT. This was likely due to ester bond 
formation, as discussed above. Ester linkages are stronger than 
the hydrogen bonds formed in PTT/MWNT and therefore more 
effective in hindering the motion of polymer chains. Moreover, 
Tm values for all PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH hybrids were lower 
than their PTT/MWNT equivalents. This lower melting 
temperature of PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH makes it a more easily 
processed blend. Conclusively, appearance of lowest Tm or 
highest Tg at 1 wt% demonstrates that an excess of MWNT or 
MWNT–OH content occurred at >1 wt%, which dispersed 
physically in the polymer matrix. Such excess MWNT or 
MWNT–OH might cause aggregation between the organic and 
inorganic phases, and lessen the compatibility between 
PTT/MWNT and PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH. 
Furthermore, prompted by the fact that CNTs can be 
defunctionalized by thermal decomposition, TGAs were 
performed to determine the effect of MWNT–OH loading on the 
weight loss of hybrid blends. The results are shown in Figure 7 
and Table 1. The IDTs of PTT-g-AA and hybrid blends with 1.0 
wt% MWNT–OH content were 362oC and 451oC, respectively. 
MWNT–OH itself was not degraded at temperatures up to 
500oC. The increase in IDT was likely caused by inhibition of 
molecular motion, as described above. Another potential cause 
is condensation reactions between MWNT–OH and PTT-g-AA. 
Kong et al.43 studied the properties of polystyrene/MWNT 
nanocomposites and reported similar phenomena. According to 
the TGA traces in Figure 7, the IDT of PTT-g-AA increased by 
89oC with the addition of 1 wt% MWNT–OH. The IDT was 
enhanced only another 15oC as the MWNT–OH content was 
increased from 1 to 2 wt%. This result further supports the 
above conclusion that optimal loading of MWNT–OH in 
PTT-g-AA occurs at 1 wt%. As previously noted, excess 
MWNT–OH decreased the constituent compatibility in the 
hybrid blends. 
In addition, the residual mass of the PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH 
nanocomposites increased with increasing MWNT–OH content. 
This may have been attributable to a physical barrier effect in 
which the MWNT–OH prevented the transport of decomposition 
products. Similar results have been reported whereby the 
thermal stability of polypropylene/MWNT nanocomposites was 
improved by a physical barrier effect and enhanced by ablative 
reassembling of the MWNT layer.44 The TGA results 
demonstrated that the incorporation of a small quantity of 
MWNT–OH can markedly improve the thermal stability of 
PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH nanocomposites. As to the results in 
Table 1, the IDT values were higher in both the PTT/MWNT 
and PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH hybrids. In addition, despite the 
lower IDT of PTT-g-AA relative to PTT, the 
PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH hybrid materials exhibited higher IDT 
values than those of the equivalent PTT/MWNT blends. This 
outcome was a result of the difference in interfacial forces in the 
two hybrid materials: the weaker hydrogen bonds of 
PTT/MWNT relative to the stronger coordination sites 
associated with the carboxylic acid groups of PTT-g-AA and 
the –OH groups of MWNT–OH. Table 1 further showed that the 
change in IDT for both hybrid materials was not significant at a 
MWNT or MWNT–OH content above 1 wt%, which was also 
attributable to agglomeration at higher filler content (Figure 8). 
Hybrid morphology 
   The morphology of the MWNT–OH and polymer blends can 
be directly related to their mechanical properties. In general, 
good dispersion of MWNT–OH throughout the polymer matrix, 
effective functionalization of MWNT–OH, and strong interfacial 
adhesion between the two phases are required to obtain a 
composite material with satisfactory mechanical properties. 
Tensile fractured surfaces of PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH blends 
were imaged with TEM. The resulting micrographs are shown in 
Figure 8. Individual embedded MWNT–OH tubes were difficult 
to locate in the polymer matrix when there were insufficient 
dispersion and poor interfacial adhesion between MWNT–OH 
and the polymer matrix. This resulted in the formation of 
MWNT–OH aggregates. As shown in Figure 8, MWNT–OH 
was evenly dispersed in the polymer matrix at a loading of 1 
wt% but formed aggregates at 2 wt%. 
Mechanical properties of hybrids 
The variation in tensile strength at break (TS) , elongation at 
break (EB) and initial modulus (IM), as a function of MWNT or 
MWNT–OH content in PTT/MWNT and 
PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH, is shown in Table 2. Maximum (TS 
and IM) or Minimum (EB) values for both PTT/MWNT and 
PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH were realized at about 1 wt% MWNT 
and MWNT–OH. In PTT/MWNT, the effect of MWNT content 
on the tensile strength was slight due to the lack of bonding 
between the PTT matrix and the MWNT. 
PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH, with the same MWNT or MWNT–OH 
loading, exhibited a much higher tensile strength than 
PTT/MWNT, despite the lower tensile strength of the 
PTT-g-AA copolymer relative to pure PTT. This enhancement 
may have been attributable to the presence of MWNT–OH and 
the formation of ester linkages, as discussed above. Although 
the tensile strength of PTT-g-AA/MWNT–OH increased to 
about 82.6 MPa at 1 wt% MWNT–OH, it decreased 
considerably at higher MWNT–OH loading, likely due to 
separation between the organic and inorganic phases.  
The positive effect on tensile strength may have been due to 
several factors, including the stiffness of the MWNT−OH layers 
contributing to the presence of immobilized or partially 
immobilized polymer phases,45 the high aspect ratio and surface 
area of the CNTs, and the nanoscale dispersion of MWNT−OH 
layers in the polymer matrix. In addition, the orientation of the 
MWNT−OH layer, as well as the molecular orientation of 
individual MWNT–OH, may have contributed to the observed 
reinforcement effect. The slight decrease in tensile strength at 
MWNT−OH loading above 1 wt% may have been attributable to 
aggregation of MWNT−OH These results support the theoretical 
and molecular simulation predictions that stress transfer, and 
hence the strength of the composites, can be effectively 
increased by the formation of chemical bonds between the

1. 日前許多國家都致力於研究開發以聚對苯二甲酸丙二酯之奈米級聚酯複合材。其
中一項最重要的方法是將聚對苯二甲酸丙二酯與無機材料, 自備成奈米級聚酯複合
材在國內外之技術鮮少見到。 
2 奈米級聚酯複合材具有分解性的聚酯高分子，除了在使用產品時，必須有適當的性
能供其利用外，更需於廢棄後能減少環保問題。 
3. 聚對苯二甲酸丙二酯為最近具有發展潛力的聚酯類纖維之材料，國內對它的開發
應用晚於外國，國外已應用於生產上。 
4. 聚對苯二甲酸丙二酯在國外被應用於電子材料零件、家電機器零件、汽車零件、
一般機械零件、醫療器具零件、玩具零件、包裝製品、肥料袋、育苗袋、農業用薄膜、
餐具、地毯業、紡織業、膜片和包裝市場等方面，它具有優於塑膠製品的易於加工、
透光度及保溼性佳，所以有逐漸取代未能全降解之塑膠品(如 PE、PP 等)的趨勢。 
5. 並將改質劑聚對苯二甲酸丙二酯接枝丙烯酸加入聚對苯二甲酸丙二酯/多層膜奈
米碳管合膠中進行混練，必能增加彼此之相容性，進而增加其機械性質、導電性與耐
熱性。 
6. 本計畫之實驗、理論、結果和流程均可提供國內製造電子材料零件、家電機器零
件、汽車零件、一般機械零件、醫療器具零件、玩具零件、包裝及包覆材料、育苗袋、
農業用薄膜、餐具、地毯業、紡織業、膜片和包裝市場等方面廠商之參考。 
7. 產品附加價值高，不必靠低勞力成本競爭。 
8. 可為未來開發新產品奠定基礎，培養其他塑膠複合材料之研究發展能力。
