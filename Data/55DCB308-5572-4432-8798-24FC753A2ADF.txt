Abstract 
High-k gate dielectrics and metal gate electrode process development are the main issues in this 
project. Fluorination of gate dielectrics and nitridation of metal gate materials had been studied and had 
already published to international conference papers. From the high-k gate dielectrics point of view, 
conventional Fluorine implantation and CF4 plasma processes have been incorporated in silicon surface 
and bulk-Al2O3, respectively. It was found to be no degradation on leakage current, capacitance 
equivalent thickness (CET) and hysteresis characteristics. The role of fluorine atoms on Al2O3 films and a 
model of dielectrics dipole oscillator associated to the capacitance dispersion were also discussed by 
ellipsometry analysis. For metal gate electrode aspects, HfNx films were deposited on Al2O3 gate 
dielectrics. HfNx/Al2O3 stack gate has excellent thermal stability, and easy controllable of work function 
(Φm) with various nitrogen flow rates during sputtering process. In addition, it has been found that the 
modification of effective work function (Φm,eff) was dominated by intrinsic Fermi-level pinning effects.

bulk high-k or silicon surface. In our previous 
works[1], had demonstrated that hysteresis and 
oxide reliability could be improved by fluorine 
incorporation. In this experiment, we discussed 
the role of fluorine atoms on capacitance 
dispersion and proposed a model of dielectrics 
dipole oscillator by ellipsometry analysis. 
 
2. Experiments 
Selected samples was firstly implanted on 
silicon surface by F19+ species followed by 
standard RCA cleaning and RTN (rapid thermal 
nitridation). Al2O3 was deposited by ALD (atomic 
layer deposition) with precursors of TMA 
(Trimethylaluminum) and O3. CF4 plasma 
treatment for 5 min was employed on the bulk 
Al2O3 by PECVD. TiN/Ti gate electrode was 
deposited by reactive sputtering. The key process 
flow for this experiment is shown in Fig. 1. 
Electrical characteristics were measured by LCR 
meter of HP4285 and HP4156C analyzer. 
Physical properties were also estimated by 
different tools of SIMS (secondary ion mass 
spectroscopy), ESCA (electron spectroscopy for 
chemical analysis) and ellipsometry. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Physical and electrical properties of fluorinated 
Al2O3  
Figure 2 shows the F (fluorine) SIMS depth 
profile of MOS capacitor structure with various F 
incorporated methods. It is obviously that F 
intensity is highest for both employing of F 
implantation and CF4 plasma process. In Fig. 3 
shows the ESCA spectra of F1s which imply that 
combining both of F incorporated approaches, Fig. 
3 (d), has higher intensity for the F-Al bonding 
and would decrease after PMA process (Fig. 3 (a) 
and (c)). This could be due to the out diffusion of 
F from the silicon surface or bulk dielectrics when 
devices are treated in elevated temperature. 
Current-voltage characteristics of gate leakage are 
shown in Fig. 4 for fluorinated samples. It shows 
that leakage current is comparable for all the F 
implantation and control samples with CF4 plasma 
treatment. The CET (capacitance equivalent 
thickness) of Al2O3 are shown in Fig. 5, the 
thickness of CF4 plasma treated samples are 
thicker than the samples without treating by CF4 
plasma, which may be the results of F bonding 
within Al2O3 films causing lower dielectric 
constant. Figure 6 shows the hysteresis 
phenomenon of F terminated Al2O3 comparing to 
the control samples. It is apparent that either F 
implantation nor CF4 plasma processes affects 
hysteresis significantly, which means that 
densities of oxide trap or mobile ion charges are 
independent of F concentration. This can also be 
proved from the flat band voltage as shown in the 
insert of Fig. 6. 
 
Mechanism of dipole oscillator by ellipsometry 
study 
 Measured refractive index as a function of 
wavelength are shown in Fig. 7. Figure 8 shows 
the dispersion of refractive index curves, which is 
plotted from the Sellmeier formulation [2], [3]: 
 
, 
where n is refractive index, S0 is average 
oscillator strength and λ0 is average oscillator 
position. The λ0 is increasing as F concentration 
becomes higher, which implies that Al-F dipoles 
are substituted for Al-O dipoles. This is because 
resonance frequency ω0 of dielectric dipoles is 
inverse proportion to λ0. Al-F dipoles have a

function (Φm,eff) value for each N2 ratio was 
calculated using the intercept of extrapolated with 
y-axis. Figure 9 shows effective work function 
(Φm,eff) of HfNx as a function of N2 flow ratio. The 
Φm,eff value for HfNx/Al2O3 gate stack with 
different N2 ratio ranged from 4.4eV (low N2) to 
4.6eV (high N2). Effective metal work function on 
high-k dielectrics was usually differ appreciably 
from the value on SiO2 or in vacuum. Compared 
with HfNx/SiO2 sample, the effective work 
function (Φm,eff) value of HfNx/Al2O3 gate stack 
was pinned at near the midgap (~4.6eV). A 
physical model was proposed to explain pinning 
phenomena, as shown in Fig. 11. The HfNx/SiO2 
structure has little interface states (Fig. 11-a), 
however the effective intrinsic interface states 
occurs near the midgap for HfNx/Al2O3 structure 
(Fig. 11-b) and creates a dipole that tends to drive 
the band lineup toward the midgap position. The 
excellent thermal stability of effective work 
function (Φm,eff) for HfNx/Al2O3 gate stack with 
different N2 ratio was observed in Figure 10.
