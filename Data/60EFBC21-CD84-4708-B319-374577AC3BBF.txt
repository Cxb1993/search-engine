2Optimization of 8-Hydroxygenistein production by Aspergillus oryzae 322881
Abstract2
8-Hydroxygenistein is a biotransformed metabolite of soyisoflavone genistein by3
Aspergillus oryzae. The compound has been proven to be a potent mushroom tyrosinase4
inhibitor. The reaction mechanism of the inhibitor was demonstrated to be irreversible mode5
and belonged to suicide substrate type of tyrosinase. Due to rare potent irreversible inhibitors6
were found, the compound has great potential in whitening cosmetics industry. In the present7
study, different cultivation conditions including rotary speed, cultivation temperature, medium8
carbon source, and nitrogen source were conduced to study the optimal 8-hydroxygenistein9
production by A. oryzae. The results shown that the fungus produced maximal 606g/ml of10
8-hydroxygenistein under the cultivation condition at 30 ? and 120 rpm using sodium11
casein and urea as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The optimal cultivation12
condition obtained in the present study for the 8-hydroxygenistein production by A. oryzae is13
now conducting its performance in a larger scale and jar-fermentor by our cooperated14
laboratory.15

Introduction20
Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a copper-containing monooxygenase widely21
distributed in nature. The enzyme catalyzes the first two reactions of melanin synthesis, the22
hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, L-dopa, and the oxidation of23
L-dopa to dopaquinone. This o-quinone is a highly reactive compound and can polymerize24
spontaneously to form melanin (1). Although the pigment melanin in human skin is a major25
defense mechanism against the ultraviolet light of the sun, the production of abnormal26
pigmentation such as melasma, freckles, age-spots, liver spots, and other forms of melanin27
hyperpigmentation can be a serious aesthetic problem (2). Hence, inhibiting the tyrosinase28
4Fermentation of the strain BRCR322881
A seed culture of the strain was initiated by adding 1.5 ml of a thawed spore2
suspension (about 108 spores per ml) into a 250-ml baffled Erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml3
of YM medium with 1 mg/ml of genistein. The compositions of YM medium are 10 g yeast4
extract, 20 g malt extract, and 10 g glucose in one liter distilled water. The pH of the medium5
was adjusted to pH 7.2 prior to autoclave. The flask was then incubated at 30 ? for 3 days6
at 120 rpm for a standard cultivation condition. For testing fermentation factors, different7
cultivation conditions changing a factor once were performed. For fermentation using8
different carbon sources, glucose in the YM medium was replaced by the desired carbon9
source. For fermentation using different nitrogen sources, both yeast extract and malt extract10
in the YM medium were replaced by the desired nitrogen source. After fermentation, equal11
volume of ethanol was added to each cultivation and shaken vigorously for 30 min at room12
temperature. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4,800 rpm. The supernatant13
from the extracted broth was assayed to measure the 8-hydroxygenistein production. The14
experiments were carried out in triplicate and the mean values are shown.15
HPLC analysis of 8-Hydroxygenistein16
The supernatant was filtered through 0.2-μm nylon filters and 20 μl ofeach sample17
was used for HPLC analysis using analytic C18 reversed-phase column (Spherisorb, 5 m,18
4.6 i.d. ?250 mm, ODS 2, Phase Separation Ltd, Deeside Industrial Park, Clwyd, U.K.). The19
gradient elution using water (A) containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid and acetonitrile (B) consisted20
of an isocratic elution for 10 min with 14% B, and a linear gradient for 50 min with 20% to21
40% B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. All of the samples were monitored at 260 nm. The amount22
of 8-hydroxygenistein in each fermentation broth was calculated by fitting the HPLC area of23
the sample to a standard curve obtained from HPLC analysis of a serious concentration of24
standard 8-hydroxygenistein.25
6optimal cultivation conditions for the production of 8-hydroxygenistein by A. oryzae and the1
results were in the Figure 2c and 2d. The strain BCRC32288 exhibited maximal2
8-hydroxygenistein production (212g/ml) when sodium casein was used as the carbon3
source (Figure 2c). In contrast, the fungus grew poorly and showed little 8-hydroxygenistein4
production when cultivated using glycerol and sorbitol as the carbon sources. In the other5
hand, BCRC32288 displayed potent 8-hydroxygenistein production when cultivated using6
urea as the nitrogen sources and the maximal 8-hydroxygenistein production reached 6067
g/ml (Figure 3d). Both (NH4)2SO4 and NaNO3 were not good nitrogen sources for both cell8
growth and 8-hydroxygenistein production of A. oryzae.9
