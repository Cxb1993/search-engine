英文摘要 
The low-temperature polycrystalline silicon thin-film 
transistor (poly-Si TFT) is the key technology for 
realization of high-quality active-matrix liquid crystal 
display (AMLCD). Another breakthrough technology of 
poly-Si TFTs is to achieve system on panel (SOP). This 
means that periphery circuits, key devices, and driving 
circuits all integrated on glass substrate. Shrinking the 
transistor dimension could enhance the circuit operation 
speed, increase the transistor density on circuit, and add 
function of design capability of the circuit. Therefore, this 
proposal will base on our previous achievements, by 
designing novel tri-gate nanowires poly-Si TFT structure 
with gate-length (Lg = 0.5 um) to investigate its 
short-channel effect and reliability mechanism under ac 
stress. In the experimental results, the tri-gate nanowires 
poly-Si TFT reveals superior short-channel effect and 
good ac and dc stress reliability. We hope this study can 
help the Taiwan AMLCD industry and the realization of 
future SOP.

二、 Introduction (計畫的緣由與目的) 
In recent years, polycrystalline silicon thin-film 
transistors (poly-Si TFTs) have drawn much attention 
because of their widely applications on active matrix 
liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs) [1], and organic 
light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) [2]. Except large area 
displays, poly-Si TFTs also have been applied for memory 
devices such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 
[3], static random access memory (SRAM) [4]. However, 
reliability of ploy-Si TFT is one of the main constraints 
toward this direction. In comparison with 
single-crystalline silicon, granular structure of poly-Si is 
rich in grain boundary defects arising from lattice 
discontinuities between different oriented grains as well as 
intra-grain defects. Moreover, a low process temperature, 
i.e. less than 6000C, also produces numerous defects at the 
poly-Si\SiO2 interface and poly-silicon boundaries. Under 
the operation of high drain voltage and a relatively high 
gate voltage (hot-carrier condition), the defects acting as 
trapping centers lead to hot-carrier injection that generates 
trap states. Thus, those generated trap states are strongly 
influenced the performance of poly-TFTs and causes 
severe device characteristics degradation, such as 
threshold voltage (Vth), subthreshold swing (SS), ON 
current (Ion), and transconductance(Gm). The Gm 
degradation and Vth variation during stress application 
which results in improper operation and circuit failure is of 
great importance for circuit designers in order to integrate 
TFTs in flat-panel displays or VLSI circuits. In AMLCD 
application, unlike pixel TFTs, TFTs in the driver circuits 
are subject to high-frequency voltage pulses [5]. The 
degradation behavior under dynamic stress is closer to real 
operation condition than the static stress. Therefore, 
improvement of TFTs degradation under dynamic stress is 
most important requirements in realization of 
system-on-panel (SOP).  
Accordingly, the reliability of poly-Si TFTs under dc 
[6]-[9], and ac [10]-[12] stress has been investigated. 
However, to our knowledge, improvement of poly-Si TFT 
degradation under dc and ac hot-carrier stress by device 
structure modulation has not been addressed. Therefore, 
based our previous works [13], [14], the tri-gate nanowires 
Poly-Si TFT has superior performance than convention 
single-gate poly-Si TFT. Thus, in this study, we further 
 4
 
 
The poly-TFTs’ non-ideal effect, Kink effect, which is 
due to the holes injected and stored in a floating body to 
cause the reduction of the threshold voltage and a parasitic 
bipolar element is resulting in positive-feedback effect to 
enhance the generation of the hot-carriers [16]. This kink 
effect associated with float-body is especially dramatic for 
n-channel devices, because of the higher impact-ionization 
rate of electrons. Therefore, in this study, the static hot 
carrier stress condition is determined at kink-effect 
occurrence, Vd = 6 V and Vg = 3V, and the source 
potential is common. The dynamic pulse train stress is 
defined at constant Vd = 6 V and dynamic Vg = 3V (ON), 
-3V (OFF) with the duty cycle of 50%, and the source 
potential is grounded. The waveform of the pulse train is 
shown in Fig. 3. In this study, we discuss the device 
reliability after a series of stress frequency (f), rising time 
(tr), falling time (tf) and substrate temperature (T) 
conditions.  
 
 
Figure 4a depicts typical M10 poly-Si TFT Id-Vg 
curves before and after dc hot carrier stress at 10000 
second. Fig. 4b depicts typical S1 poly-Si TFT Id-Vg 
curves before and after dc hot carrier stress at 10000 
second. The S1 poly-Si TFT presents sever degradation  
 
Figure 5 depicts maximum conductance (Gm,max) 
degradation of S1 (dash-line) and M10 TFT (solid-line) as 
a function of the stress time with different frequencies (dc, 
f = 1K Hz, and f = 1M Hz). The S1 and M10 TFT show 
the similar Gm degradation. These results reveal that the 
S1 and M10 have similar tail state generation.  Figure 6a 
and 6b depict the Vth and SS variation of S1 and M10 TFT 
as a function of the stress time with different frequencies, 
respectively. For S1 TFT, the Vth and SS variation under 
ac hot-carrier stress are severer than dc stress. These 
results can be explained that during the ac stress falling 
time period, the hot-carrier suffering higher electrical field 
(from ON-state: Vg = 3V to OFF-state:  Vg = -3V) than 
dc stress. In addition, the Vth and SS variation increases 
with the frequency increasing from 1 K Hz to 1 MHz. 
These results reveal that the degradation was depended on 
repetition number. On the contrary, for M10 TFT the Vth 
and SS variation is much lower than the S1 TFT. 
According to table I, these results indicate that the M10 
TFT has less deep states generation after dc and ac stress. 
Firstly, the M10 TFT has more effective NH3 plasma 
passivation than that of S1 TFT due to the ten split 
nanowire channels of M10 TFT has wide NH3 plasma 
passivation area (Fig. 2a). Secondly, M10 TFT has robust 
tri-gate control (Fig. 2b) can reduce the lateral electrical 
field and its penetration from the drain. For further 
confirm this explain, 2-D device electrical simulation were 
carried out.

四、 Conclusion (結論) 
The performance and ac and dc reliability of 
ten-nanowire poly-Si TFTs are investigated. The 
experiment results reveal that the ten-nanowire poly-Si 
TFTs has higher performance than single-channel TFT, 
including a high ON/OFF current ratio, a low subthreshold 
slope, an absence of DIBL and favorable output 
characteristics. In static and dynamic hot-carrier stress 
experiments, the multiple nanowire poly-Si TFTs reduces 
the degradation of Vth, SS, Ion, On/OFF ratio and DIBL, 
for all kind of frequency, rising time, falling time and 
temperature, compared to single-channel TFT. These high 
reliability results and superior short channel effect of 
ten-nanowire poly-Si TFTs can be explained by its robust 
tri-gate control and its superior channel NH3 passivation 
on the poly-Si grain boundary. The fabrication of this 
novel multiple nanowire channels structure TFTs is easy 
and involves no additional processes. Such TFTs are thus 
highly promising for use in future high-performance 
poly-Si TFT applications.
