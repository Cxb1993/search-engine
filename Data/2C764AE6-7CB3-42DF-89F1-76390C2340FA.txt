2.1. Metal sheets
Those  metallic  sheets,  measuring 5  mm × 5  mm, 
made of various magnesium alloys were machined by 
wire  electrical  discharge  machining  (WEDM). 
Afterward  the surface  of  magnesium alloy sheet  was 
polished by 600 grit enamel paper and down to 0.3µm 
Al2O3 powder [9-15].
2.2. Cell culture
HAEC were isolated as previously described. Cells 
of  passage  4  were  seeded  (800 cells/mm2)  onto  the 
metallic sheets, which were placed at the center of a 35 
mm tissue culture treated polystyrene dish filled with 8 
ml  of  culture  medium (Medium  200 (GIBCO,  New 
York,  USA)).  Forty-eight  hours  later,  the  cells  were 
examined  by  immunofluorescence  microscopy.  For 
immunolabeling, cells grown on gelatin-coated (Merck, 
Darmstadt,  Germany)  glass  coverslips  were  used  as 
control [9-12, 15].
2.3. Immunocytochemistry
    
For  immunolabeling,  cells  grown on  the  metallic 
sheets  were  fixed  with  methanol  at  -20  °C  for  5 
minutes. After blocking with 0.5% BSA for 15 minutes, 
the cells  were incubated with the anti-VWF antibody 
(1:50) and anti-Cx43 antibody (1:100) at 37 °C for 1.5 
hours,  followed  by  incubation  with  CY3  conjugated 
donkey  anti-mouse  antibody  (1:500;  Chemicon) and 
FITC  conjugated  donkey anti-mouse  antibody  (1:50; 
Chemicon) for 50minutes in the dark.  Then, the cells 
were incubated with bisbenzamide (1:1000; Sigma) for 
15  minutes,  examined  and  recorded  using  an 
epifluorescence  microscope  equipped  with  a  digital 
camera [9-12, 15].
2.4. Degradation
The  degradation  test  was  carried  out  at  room 
temperature using a culture medium 200 of 50 ml tube 
(Falcon USA). The samples,  measuring 20 mm × 20 
mm × 0.1 mm, made of various magnesium alloys were 
cleaned before testing using ethanol and immersed in 
the medium. Then, at each time-critical observation, 1.5 
ml  medium  was  drawn  out  to  determine  the 
concentration of Mg2+ ion within 15 weeks [1-2].
2.5. Analysis
For  comparison  of  cellularity,  cells  were  stained 
with  bisbenzamide to  make the nucleus visible  under 
fluorescence  microscope  and  were  observed  in  x160 
magnification.  Images  of  10 randomly  selected 
rectangular  fields. The  images  were  then  analyzed 
using QWIN image analysis software (Leica) to count 
the nucleus. For this purpose, 4 separate experiments of 
cell culture for all types of materials were conducted. 
All  data,  expressed  as  mean  values  (±SD),  were 
compared statistically by t-test. A p value < 0.05 was 
considered to be significant [9-12, 15].
3. Results
3.1. Determination of magnesium degradation
The  content  of  Mg2+  within  15  weeks  gradually 
increased  to  more  than  40  mg/dL  in  the  culture 
medium, but remained less than 10 mg/dL in the water 
(Figure 1).
3.2. Cell proliferation assays
After seeding, cells were able to attach and grow on 
the  surface,  but  the  cell  proliferation at  48  hours 
following the seeding  varies widely, according to the 
magnesium alloys (Figure 2 and figure 3). Regarding 
the magnesium alloys, for seeding of 800 cells/mm2, all 
magnesium alloys have comparable or  lower values of 
cellularity, compared to the control (all vs control (637 
cells/mm2), p<0.05). Generally, for the seeding of 800 
cells/mm2, the cellularity on each of magneium groups 
is less than 60% of control group [9-15].
3.3. Immunofluorescence microscopy
Typically  Cx43  gap  junctions,  seen  as  punctate 
labelngs at cells borders, were abundant in the control 
group,  but  less  expressed  in  the  remaining  groups 
(Figure 4). A similar pattern of expression levels was 
seen for VWF (Figure  4), the labellings of which are 
located in the cytoplasmic compartment. However, the 
trend of VWF is not obviously among these magnesium 
alloys [9-12, 15].
4. Discussion
This  study  demonstrates  that  the  phenotypic 
features of  endothelial  cells,  including growth profile 
and expression of proteins are altered when grown on 
the  biodegradable  magnesium  surface.  Therefore,  it 
suggests that strategies to improve the biocompatibility
