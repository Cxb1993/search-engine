This is the first year research result of a 
three-year project, titled “Research on 
formability of flexible subtract in 
micro/nanoimprint process and application on 
fabrication and performance enhancement of 
solar cell, OLED and photonic crystal.” The 
results include experimental nanoimprint 
formability of polymer subtracts with different 
molecular weights and molecular dynamics 
simulation by parallel computing 
In order to overcome the bottom neck of 
photolithography for producing tiny feature 
devices due to the limitation of light scattering 
and wave length of light source, nanoimprint 
lithography is a promising technology. In this 
study, textured stamp was used to transfer 
patterns into polymer materials by using hot 
embossing method. Surface roughness of stamp 
and coated anti-sticking layers was investigated 
for understanding the flow behavior of the 
deformed material, where two polymer materials 
with different averaged molecular weight were 
compared by experiments. The experimental 
results have demonstrated that PMMA 
(Mw=350K) is a good choice to nano scale mold 
transfer because its line-width can reach 
118.8nm without sticking. 
The study of nanoimprint formability for the 
polymer material with self-assembled 
monolayer using parallel computing technique 
was also conducted. The simulation codes were 
built based on molecular dynamics (MD) 
method with the parallel computing technique to 
observe deformation behaviors of polymer 
material where stamp with or without 
self-assembled monolayer. According to MD 
simulation results, stamp without SAM layer 
behaves severe adhesion phenomenon. Several 
process conditions, which will result in good

(1) Study on Nanoimprint Lithography of the Polymer Chains (CH2)n with Anti-Adhesion Layer on Stamp 
by Molecular Dynamics Method 
 
(2) Study on IC Probe Card Simulation by Molecular Dynamics and Finite Element Method 
 2 Copyright © 2008 by ASME 
increases rapidly, and ultimately, when it reaches the marginal 
value, the specimen collapses. Further, nanoimprint of Cu-Ni 
alloy has been simulated by the authors [8], which depicts a 
cyclically vibrated relationship of force and displacement 
showing a more complicated interaction between different 
kinds of atoms. The plastic deformation processes during 
nanoindentation of silicon through MD simulations have been 
investigated by Gannepalli and Mallapragada [9] to identify 
and characterize the plastic rearrangements occurring during 
indentation. However, studies regarding NIL processes by 
numerical methods are still incomplete, because few papers can 
deal with the most important issue regarding to adhesion 
problem of NIL. 
This paper aims at the study on NIL of the polymer 
material in (CH2)n Chains. The simulation codes were built 
based on MD method to observe material deformation 
behaviors in atomic scale. The deformation mechanism of 
nanoimprint lithography of polymer material (CH2)n pressed by 
silicon stamp was first studied, by which the effects of critical 
punch tip width, temperature, adhesion effect, and spring back 
were studied. Next, the nanoimprint processes with stamp tips 
covered by anti-adhesion material, which is a self-assembled 
monolayer (SAM), were studied to compare to those processes 
without having anti-adhesion layer.

METHODOLOGY 
The hardness of silicon stamp is larger than polymer 
materials, therefore, it was assumed as a rigid body. There 
were three punch tip widths studied in the proposed paper, 
namely: 3, 10 and 30nm. The imprinting depth was 5nm and 
the imprinting velocity was 100m/s. The atoms in silicon stamp 
were arranged based on the diamond structure whose 
temperature was assumed in three cases: 0, 273 and 300K. In 
the SAM layer, there are five molecules in a chain; the first one 
is CH2 which is connected onto the surface of silicon stamp, 
while the end free one is CH3. The simulation time step is 10
-
15sec. Several long chains were used to represent (CH2)n 
molecules connected with each other. The Lennard–Jones 
potential energy was used to describe the interaction energy 
between the molecules in different polymer chains, while the 
FENE potential was used to simulate the interaction energy 
between two neighbor molecules in the same polymer chain. 
Bond length stretching energy and bond angle bending energy 
were used to describe the interaction behaviors between two 
molecules in the same SAM chain. 
Computer simulation codes, developed by the authors, 
based on Hamiltonian dynamics, periodical boundary 
conditions and several potential functions were used to simulate 
the nanoimprint processes. A Cartesian coordinate system was 
used in the proposed system. The origin was set at the center of 
the lower left atom of the specimen. Regarding to the boundary 
conditions of the specimen, a periodic boundary condition was 
applied both in the x-axis (horizontal direction) and in the y-
axis (depth direction). In the z-axis (vertical direction), a real 
length was used; however, two fixed layers in the bottom of 
polymer materials were assumed in order to maintain 
motionless when the stamp imprinting into polymer. Therefore, 
simulation of three-dimensional nanoimprint process by the 
molecular-dynamics method can be simplified into two-
dimensions for the current study. 
Lennard-Jones potential function can be expressed as

The interaction energy between two molecules in different 
polymer chain was described by Lennard-Jones potential

by FENE potential function [11-12]. FENE potential function

There are five molecules in a SAM chain in the current 
study: the fist one which is connected with stamp tip is CH2, 
three molecules in the middle part which are connected with 
each other are also CH2, while the last one which belongs to 
free end is CH3. Due to the bonding energy between silicon 
wafer (stamp) and CH2 is large, therefore, the first molecule is 
assumed as fixed layer in MD simulation. The potential

unbalance force because some of the polymer molecules may 
not stay in the balance status. 
Figure 5 depicts the internal energy in polymer chains at 
three different temperatures and punch tip widths at loading 
stage. Low internal energy means more stable for molecules in 
polymer chains. When temperature is 0K, the internal energy 
increases when punch presses into polymer chains gradually. 
When temperature is 273 or 300K, the internal energy increases 
less than that at 0K which means that the mobility of molecules 
in polymer chains at these temperatures are higher and they can 
adjust themselves to lower down the system internal energy 
even when punch pressing into them. 
Figure 6 depicts the internal energy in polymer chains at 
unloading stage. Internal energy will become original value 
after unloading. However, at 273K and 300K, there is a small 
variation due to some polymer chains attached onto the punch 
tip after unloading.

CONCLUSIONS 
When deforming polymer material at or above room 
temperature, adhesion problems occur between stamp and 
polymer. Under this situation, pattern cannot be transferred. 
Polymer materials adhere to stamp more severe than they 
adhere to each others, because potential energies between long 
chains of polymers are small than those between polymer and 
stamp. The needed imprint force at 0K is proportional to the 
punch travel, however, at 300K which does not increase very 
fast due to higher motivation energy between polymer chains.  
From the relation between system energy and stamp translation 
resulted from MD simulations, the system energy increases 
when stamp moves gradually. When unloading, the system 
energy will return to its minimum energy status and remains 
stable. However, when punch leaves polymer materials, energy 
fluctuation occurs due to some polymer materials adhere to the 
stamp. If stamp presses into polymer very fast, some polymer 
materials also adhere to stamp even with anti-adhesion layer. 
By reducing the punch tip width and enlarging the imprint 
depth, if the stamp coated with SAM, then the pattern transfer 
from punch tip to polymer chains can be obtained.

used Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) to study the adhesive 
behavior of a polymer blend. Force-distance measurements 
with simultaneous X-modulation gave information on both 
lateral and normal force during loading and unloading [5] 
which belongs to nano scale experiments. Park, et. al. [6] used 
molecular dynamics simulations to study the chemical effects 
on the adhesion and friction between alkanethiol self-assembled 
monolayers on gold surface. However, there is still lack of 
research regarding to adhesion problem of IC probing test. 
In the proposed paper, a FORTRAN code based on 
molecular dynamics (MD) method was developed to study the 
deformation and penetration mechanism between probe tip 
(Tungsten) and pad surface (Aluminum) in a reduced-small 
scale. Two potential functions, such as Lennard-Jones potential 
function and Morse potential function, were used to compare 
adhesion behavior during probe testing. DEFORM 3D finite 
element package was also used to analyze the deformation 
pressure during probe testing by varying tip geometry and 
angle.

METHODOLOGY 
 
Molecular Dynamics (MD) Method 
 
The first MD simulation of a condensed phase system was 
performed by using a hard-sphere model. Then continuous 
potential functions were developed to simulate many nano 
scale phenomenon [7]. There are several contributions [8-11] 
by using MD method to study nanoindentation and nanoimprint 
which help the authors to conduct the MD simulation for 
realizing IC probe adhesion problem. 
The IC probing process in nano scale simulated in this 
study comprises one probe and one pad at an isothermal state 
of 293K, as shown in Figure 1. For simplicity, the probe was 
assumed as ideally rigid. Due to the impressing of the probe 
into the pad, the probing force and the adhesion problem can be 
analyzed. Unlike nanoimprint lithography, in which the 
specimen material being deformed is photoresist, the specimen 
material simulated here is an Aluminum (Al) FCC single 
crystal metal and the probe material is a Tungsten (W) BCC 
single crystal. In order to examine the probe angle effect on 
probing process, three probe angles were studied, namely: 60°, 
67° and 70°. The shape of pad is rectangular whose size is 
10nm×10nm×6nm. The size of probe is 28nm in length and 
2.5nm in diameter. The probing distance is 3nm. All the above 
dimensions were defined based on the 1 to 10,000 scale of the 
real IC probing size due to the computation limit of MD 
method. 
Computer simulation codes, developed by the authors, 
based on Hamiltonian dynamics, periodical boundary 
conditions and two potential functions (Lennard-Jones and 
Morse potential functions) were used to simulate the probing 
processes in nano scale. A Cartesian coordinate system was 
used in the proposed system as shown in Figure 1. The origin 
was set at the center of the lower left atom of the specimen. 
Regarding to the boundary conditions of the specimen, a 
periodic boundary condition was applied both in the x-axis 
(horizontal direction) and in the y-axis (depth direction). In the 
z-axis (vertical direction), a real length was used; however, two 
fixed layers in the bottom of Aluminum material were assumed 
in order to maintain motionless when the probe imprinting into 
specimen.

Lennard-Jones potential function ULJ [12] is widely used 
to describe the interacting energy between two particle i and j 
when ignoring the vibration, rotation and Hydrogen-bond 
effects. This function is expressed by the exponent relation of 
the reciprocal of distance as:

Probing Force by MD methods. 
 
Figure 4 shows the probing force resulted from MD 
simulation at three different probe angles: 60°, 67° and 70° 
when the probe dimension is 30nm in length, 2.5nm in 
diameter, probing distance is 3nm and Lennard-Jones potential 
function was used. The first 2nm distance of probe travel is a 
void travel which means that probe should contact with pad and 
have probing force after 2nm of probe position. However, from 
Figure 4, it is clear to find out that the probing force happens 
before 2nm of probe position, nearly about 1.8nm for three 
probe angles which means that when the probe comes close to 
pad will result in a jump-to-contact phenomenon between probe 
and pad. The probing force of case 60° is larger than case 70° 
may result from the contact area of the former is bigger than the 
latter. The needed force for pad probing is about 0.04~0.1µgf 
(400~1000nN) which is 10

~10
-5
 times of the normal scale 
probing test. 
 
Probing Force and Pad Bulge Profile by FEM. 
 
Figure 5 depicts the probing force related to probe travel at 
five probe angles resulted from FEM simulation. Even there are 
several peaks in force-stroke curves; the trend for each curve is 
the needed probing force reduces when the probe angle 
increases. The same results were also obtained based on MD 
method. Table 4 lists the maximum probing force and the 
maximum pad stress at five probe angles. The same trend also 
happens for the maximum pad stress; however, it increases at 
angle 90° due to small contact area. The reason why there are 
several force peaks in Figure 5 is because remeshing procedure 
in FEM. When there are nodes coming to or leaving from the 
pad surface, the probing force fluctuates. Figure 6 depicts the 
probing forces related to probe travel based on a revised 
meshing FEM case from mesh number 60,000 to 130,000 at 
probe angle 90°. It’s clear to find out that the force peaks were 
removed under increasing mesh number almost twice times.
