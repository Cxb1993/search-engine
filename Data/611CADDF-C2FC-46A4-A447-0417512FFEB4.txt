I. Introduction 
Microstrip antennas are attractive to present wireless communication products owing to 
the features of low profile and easy manufacture. For some specific wireless systems, such as 
radio frequency identification (RFID) and direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems, 
microstrip antenna with circular polarization (CP) is necessary because it is insensitive to the 
orientation between the transmitter and receiver. In addition, besides the ability to relax the 
tolerances of antenna dimensions, the CP microstrip antenna with broadband operation can 
also be used in multiple communication systems, so as to reduce the required antenna 
number. However, antenna designs with a CP bandwidth of more than 30 % are relatively 
few in the open articles, and hence are still a challenge for antenna engineers. 
For microstrip antennas, the perturbation technology [1] is a well-known method to 
generate CP radiations. By introducing perturbation segments into the antenna structures, 
two orthogonal resonant modes with frequency differences can be excited in parallel. This 
method only needs one input port and thus the antenna structure is simple; however, the 
obtained CP bandwidth is narrow and only occupies a fraction of its impedance bandwidth. 
Another method of generating the CP radiations is by employing a multi-feed configuration 
integrated with phase-delay circuits [2]. Although this design method can offer an optimum 
CP bandwidth within the impedance bandwidth, the feed mechanism is more complicated 
and an additional transmission loss is certainly generated in the phase-delay circuits, which 
would lead to a lower antenna gain. Recently, the design of a CP microstrip antenna fed by 
an L-shaped coupling line has also been proposed [3]-[4]. The feeding technique can excite 
two orthogonal resonant modes with a fixed phase difference in series and it does not need 
external phase-delay circuits; furthermore, the resulting CP bandwidth has an increase of 
around 40 % as compared to that obtained by the perturbation technology [4]. 
In addition to the feeding technique, the CP bandwidth of the microstrip antenna is 
greatly related to its impedance characteristic. In recent years, several microstrip antenna 
structures with a broad impedance bandwidth have been presented, such as using thick 
substrate with low permittivity and multi-resonator structures. Each of the CP feeding 
techniques mentioned previously also has been applied to these broadband antenna structures, 
 4
ls. A circular patch with radius R2 is fabricated on another FR4 substrate of thickness 0.4 mm 
and supported by a foam material at a distance h above the ground plane. When h = 0 mm 
and lc = 0 mm, the patch-loaded wide slot antenna becomes an annular-ring slot antenna that 
is similar to the structure studied in [14], and it can generate good CP radiations by tuning ls. 
Details of the parameter analyses and systematic design procedure have been reported in 
[14]. According to the procedure, the annular-ring slot antenna is supposed to have a CP 
bandwidth of around 6 %, but it seems that this bandwidth might not be enough to satisfy the 
requirements of some wireless systems.  
For finding a method to improve the CP bandwidth, a prototype of the annular-ring slot 
antenna designed at 2 GHz was initially constructed as a reference. The dimensions of the 
reference antenna are R1 = 20 mm, R2 = 14 mm, ls = 19 mm, ws = 11 mm, lc = 0 mm, l = 13 
mm, w = 0.5 mm, and h = 0 mm, which are obtained by referring to the design procedure in 
[14]. The experimental results of the reference antenna are shown in Fig. 2 along with the 
simulation results carried out by the IE3D software, and good agreements between them are 
demonstrated. Observing the results in Fig. 2, it is found that the reference antenna 
simultaneously has better impedance matching and lower axial ratios around 2.1 GHz, and 
the resulting CP bandwidth, referred to 3 dB axial ratio, is about 105 MHz (5 %). Note that 
the axial ratio mentioned throughout the paper is measured at broadside by using a 
linearly-polarized spinning source, and its value is determined by the variation magnitude of 
)(φθE  when the source is continuously rotated on the φ  plane [17]. In addition to the CP 
mode at 2.1 GHz, the reference antenna is found to possess another CP mode at 2.9 GHz. It 
is interesting to indicate that both the magnetic current distributions along the circumference 
of the annular-ring slot at 2.1 and 2.9 GHz have the variation of one wavelength. 
Consequently, the two CP modes have similar radiation characteristics and they can be 
simultaneously excited by the L-shaped feed line. Since a ring slot configuration can be 
considered as a loop slot antenna and a coplanar patch antenna [18], the two CP modes of the 
reference antenna are supposed to belong to the fundamental mode of an annular-ring slot 
antenna and the TM11 mode of a circular microstrip antenna. From the related articles [13], 
[19], the resonant frequencies of the two CP modes can be expressed as  
 6
times of the reference antenna.  
It is worth a mention that the CP bandwidth of Antenna A is nearly the same as the 
impedance bandwidth determined by 10 dB return loss. To further improve the CP 
bandwidth, one sensible way is to decrease the radius of the inner patch, which allows the 
two resonant frequencies, slotf  and 11TMf , to be separated farther. The case of R2 = 13 mm is 
evaluated, and its simulation results show that the two interesting CP modes can still be 
coupled together and the resultant CP bandwidth is more than that of Antenna A; but 
unfortunately, we failed to achieve the impedance matching across the whole CP operating 
frequencies. Another possible method to increase the CP bandwidth is by raising the inner 
patch away from the ground plane. 
  
IV. Broadband CP Design for a Patch-Loaded Wide Slot Antenna 
For the annular-ring slot antenna (h = 0 mm case in Fig. 1), Section III presents a new 
design method to improve the CP bandwidth. This method can be easily achieved by tuning 
the related parameters in order. If the design method can be applied to the case of h > 0 mm, 
the CP bandwidth will be further increased. The reason is that the impedance bandwidth of a 
wide slot antenna (h > 0 mm) is larger than that of a thin slot antenna (h = 0 mm). To realize 
the idea, the effects of various h on the axial ratio are first investigated. It is expected that the 
L-shaped feed line can still excite two adjacent CP modes for the patch-loaded wide slot 
antenna. When the other dimensions are constant and the same as those of the reference 
antenna, the simulated results for the cases of h = 0, 6, 11, ∞ mm are presented in Fig. 3. 
From the obtained results, it is observed that, for each h, the patch-loaded wide slot antenna 
can support several CP modes with lower axial ratios, in which the first two CP modes have 
the same radiation characteristics. In addition, with increasing h, the resonant frequencies, 
here defined as the frequency with a minimum axial ratio, of the two interesting CP modes 
are moved to higher frequencies and their frequency ratio is also increased. Assuming that 
the first two CP modes of the patch-loaded wide slot antenna can be properly coupled, the 
results in Fig. 3 suggest that the resultant CP bandwidth is larger and its center frequency is 
located at a higher frequency when the separated distance between the wide slot and parasitic 
 8
frequencies. As a result, the taper segment of length lc, which can be considered as another 
impedance transformer, is introduced into the L-shaped feed line, and it makes the 
impedance-matching process more easy and systematic. We suggest that lc is tuned prior to w 
and l. The effects of various lc on the return loss are shown in Fig. 7 when the other 
parameters are constant and the same as those of the ls = 20.5 mm case in Fig. 6. Observing 
the results in Fig. 7, it is seen that by increasing the length of the taper segment, the return 
loss can be obviously improved; while the impedance bandwidth is broadened and centered 
at a higher frequency. For the case of lc = 7 mm, the impedance bandwidth from 2.24 to 2.82 
GHz is still unable to cover the previously obtained CP operating frequencies. This problem 
can be solved by adjusting l, and the result is demonstrated in Fig. 8. By varying l, the 
impedance bandwidth is moved to other frequencies, and it can cover the entire CP operating 
frequencies when l is 9 mm. As for w, it needs to be adjusted only on the condition that the 
return loss cannot be noticeably improved by tuning lc. Among all the completed designs, 
this circumstance only occurs in the case of h = 0 mm.  
 
V. Experimental Results and Discussion 
In accordance to the above tuning procedure, several designs of the patch-loaded wide 
slot antennas with different h were successfully completed, in which the three examples with 
h = 6 (Antenna B), 11 (Antenna C), and ∞ (Antenna D) mm were constructed and measured 
to support their simulation results. The antenna dimensions and experimental results are 
summarized in Table 1, including the data of the reference antenna and Antenna A. Figs. 9 
and 10 respectively exhibit the input impedance and axial ratio results for the three examples. 
It is observed that the measured results are consistent with the simulated data. Also, the 
experimental results clearly indicate that when h is increased, the CP bandwidth is enhanced 
and its center frequency is moved to a higher frequency. As compared to Antenna A, the CP 
center frequencies of Antenna B, C, and D have increases of 17.4, 23, and 40.6 %, but their 
CP bandwidths are improved by factors of 1.7, 2.1, and 3.2, respectively. In addition, the CP 
bandwidth of Antenna D (an isolated wide slot antenna) is about 45 %, which is 2.5 times the 
CP bandwidth of the CPW-fed square wide slot antenna studied in [15]. 
 10
been presented in this paper. The antenna structure consists of a wide slot and a parasitic 
patch, and it can generate two adjacent CP modes with similar radiation patterns and 
polarization senses through the excitation of an L-shaped feed line. From the parametric 
analyses to the L-shaped feed line, it is found that the two CP modes can be coupled together 
and the impedance matching within the coupled CP frequency band can also be achieved. In 
addition, a tuning procedure for the related parameters is drawn. According to the tuning 
procedure, several prototypes are designed and implemented. Measured results show that by 
adjusting the distance between the wide slot and parasitic patch, the CP bandwidth of the 
patch-loaded wide slot antenna can be varied between 5 and 45 %. Moreover, the antenna 
gain can be improved if the parasitic patch is placed at a proper position.

二、與會心得 
1. 降低微帶天線交叉極化技術 
    微帶天線本身屬於一個窄頻的共振結構，而大量提升頻寬唯一且有效的方式是增加基底厚
度，但隨著厚度增加，在輻射金屬片上高模態的電流分量將會變的明顯，使電場極化的純淨度
變差；此外，若使用長直探針饋入，探針上的垂直電流所產生的輻射，不僅會造成輻射場型不
對稱，且在 H-plane上 ψ= 45° 的附近會產生明顯的交叉極化。因此，寬頻微帶天線其交叉極化
主要有兩個來源：高模態電流分佈及探針輻射。對於這兩個輻射源，過去文獻提出一些抑制的
方式並可獲得-20 dB以下的交叉極化比，例如，採用曲折型探針、使用具有相差 180°的雙饋入、
改變接地面形狀等。其中，使用具有相差 180°的雙探針饋入不僅能互相抵銷探針本身的輻射也
可抑制高模態的產生。但此設計除了需要額外的相位延遲電路外，也須改變探針的形狀使天線
能達成阻抗匹配，這將使天線結構複雜化並產生較大的傳輸損失。另一種降低交叉極化可行的
方式是採用槽孔耦合饋入取代探針，由於耦合槽孔能以對稱的方式激發輻射金屬片且本身無垂
直方向電流，因此具有良好的輻射場型及較低的交叉極化，但當基底厚度增加時，除了高模態
的橫向電流會被激發外，且為了達成阻抗匹配，耦合槽孔尺寸也將隨之增加，這將使得天線產
生大量的背向輻射。上述僅針對單一極化的純淨度做探討，而對於雙極化微帶天線的設計，由
於需有兩組饋入系統分別激發輻射金屬片中的兩個正交模態，因此還需考量兩饋入間的隔離
度。從過去文獻所提出的饋入組合及獲得的實驗結果得知，使用探針及槽孔耦合分別激發微帶
天線兩正交模態可得到至少 30 dB的隔離度，若再加入相位延遲電路則可更進一步增加隔離度
並同時改善交叉極化。根據上述心得，筆者思考以探針及槽孔饋入系統來分別激發微帶天線的
垂直及水平極化，其中探針饋入系統由一對具有反相的曲折金屬片組成，而對於槽孔饋入系
統，可使用一個全波長共振的圓形環槽孔作為耦合槽孔，不同於過去使用半波長共振的線性槽
孔。從初期的研究結果發現，所提出之槽孔饋入結構不僅可應用於不同基底厚度，也具有抑制
高模態的能力，並可獲得較細直槽孔更低的交叉極化；此外也發現在圓形環槽孔周圍埋入 H型
槽孔作為負載，可有效降低背向輻射。 
 
2. 寬頻單極天線設計 
    對於有關單極天線的研究，會議中提出許多增加頻寬的技術，例如：(1)利用金屬片或圓柱
取代細的短路探針，(2)使用耦合饋入技術，(3)使用漸進式饋入。對於使用第一種增加頻寬的技
術應用於短路負載單偶極天線，當天線高度為 0.07λ0時天線頻寬可從 3 %提升到 10 % 以上。
而對天線高度為 0.08 及 0.092λ0，使用第二種技術天線頻寬則可達到約 30 %。然而，使用類
似的耦合饋入技術應用於平面倒 F型天線時，天線頻寬可達 39 %(天線高度為 0.1λ0)，而應用於
TM01 mode之圓形微帶天線時，頻寬甚至可高達 52 %(天線高度為 0.15λ0)。因此過去文獻所完
成有關負載單極天線的頻寬與其他具有類似輻射性質的天線相比較，則略顯不足，特別是當它
應用於超寬頻系統時(頻寬至少 25 %或超過 1 GHz)。此外，過去文獻中對短路負載單偶極天線
所提出之耦合饋入方式，有使用螺旋探針及 L型探針，這些設計結構複雜且不易量產。因此可
思考一個新的耦合設計技術，不僅天線結構簡單且頻寬可超過 50 %，並能涵蓋 DCS、PCS、3G
及 WLAN頻帶，且在阻抗頻寬內天線需具有穩定之全向性輻射特性。
