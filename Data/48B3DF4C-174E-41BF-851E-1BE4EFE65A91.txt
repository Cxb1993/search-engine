purposefully signal the necessity of a direct and rigorous measurement of surface traction at cell-
substrate interface for characterizing the chemo-mechanical feedback controls in cellular 
functions. 
The microscopy approach in reconstructing traction forces was pioneered by Harris et al., 
who first applied the deformable silicone substrata to probe traction forces qualitatively by the 
wrinkling assay 19, 20. The complex relation between force and deformation (wrinkle) and the low 
resolution of wrinkling assay made the quantitative measurement difficult. A more direct 
characterization of non-wrinkling silicone with embedded particles as indicators of deformation 
was later developed by Lee et al. 11. However, the viscosity of the substrata used in Lee’s study 
led to irreversible deformation and poor conditions for cell adhesion. Dembo and Wang further 
developed traction force microscopy by using the substrata prepared from polyacrylamide (PAM) 
gel with embedded fluorescent beads 21, 22. PAM has the advantages over other materials because 
of its tunable mechanical compliance through the change of reaction condition for acryl amide 
polymerization. Furthermore, cell adhesion on polyacrylamide gel is not significant without the 
conjugating of adhesive ligands. Hence PAM is ideal for studying mechanotransduction through 
the quantitative determination of tractions on PAM gel surface induced by cells. The calculation 
of cellular traction force via the displacements of fluorescent bead is an inverse problem which 
can be ill-posed and requires some regularization (constraint with Lagrange multiplier) 4. Here 
the inverse problem means the following. Assuming beads’ displacement is obtained from the 
Fredholm integral of force with Green’s function as a kernel, i.e., )()()( rFrrGrru   d , the 
task is to search the force )(rF   which yields the minimum difference between the calculated and 
measured displacements with presumed mechanical properties. Such numerical process is 
essential an optimization problem and therefore constraints on the force )(rF   are needed to 
4 
measure the movement of objects in the images. DIC was extensively used in many studies of 
bioimaging for probing cell mobility and cytoskeleton dynamics 26, 30-32.  Another interesting 
issue is that Boussinesq solution assumes the substratum to be an infinite half-space. Such 
assumption can be accurately achieved only if the displacement field by traction force is small 
compared to the substratum’s lateral dimensions and thickness. For a medium with low elastic 
modulus like PAM, a small deformation is hard to guarantee and if its thickness exceeds 100μm, 
the substratum can be easily deformed by its own weight. One practical way to circumvent this 
limitation is to analyze the three dimensional gel by finite element (FE) analysis 26, 30-32. The 
measured displacement field from experiments is directly applied as boundary conditions 
without using any specific mapping as seen in other methods.  
In this study, rat aorta smooth muscle cells (SMC) are chosen as model for probing 
cellular traction force on a PAM substratum. The study was carried out in two steps. First, 
atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to characterize the stiffness of PAM film. Secondly, 
the deformation images of PAM substratum induced by cell traction are probed by fluorescence 
microcopy. The deformation was measured by the relative position of displaced fluorescent latex 
beads via particle image velocimetry (PIV). The measured data (displacement) was then input as 
boundary conditions for the subsequent finite simulation. In the simulation, a non-linear 
(Mooney-Rivilin) material model was employed and the optimal range of PAM mechanical 
properties was investigated as well.
