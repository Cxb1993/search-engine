前言
波與週期結構的交互作用是物理研究中的一大課題。近年來， Pendry 
(2004) 等人發表了著名的以具有表面週期孔洞結構的完美導體，有等效於具有
表面電漿金屬所產生之表面波現象的報告，更使得表面電漿的現象，有了新的
研究方向，以及操作表面波傳播元件設計與製造的可能性。
而光子與聲子的類比，促使我們想去探討具表面週期孔洞結構彈性物質之
聲音的傳播及其等效表面波的行為。表面聲波元件與表面電漿元件一樣，在工
程科技上也有許多的用處，濾波器即是一例。藉由設計彈性物質的微結構，我
們可以控制表面波的性質，進而設計聲子晶體元件。
研究目的
在理論上，即便是完美邊界(perfect boundary conditions) 之小單孔散
射體，亦尚未有一足夠精確之解析解存在，而此則包含了孔洞出口處之入射角
度及孔洞之三維幾何效應 。類似的波動現象，如電磁波，入射至單一孔洞，仍
侷限於穿透薄板孔洞之解(Bethe, 1944)，且入射角度之依存性亦未有著墨，
若將此解應用於如Garcia de Abajo (2005) 之未貫穿孔洞之表面，則不能不
無疑慮。且孔洞深度之效應與穿透薄板孔洞之探討也未得見。欠缺這方面基本
的解析，使得許多相關研究侷限於實驗，場域數值方法計算之範疇。這是吾等
認為迫切的需要一足夠精確之解析分析的原因。
　　本計畫的一個主要目的，則在於求解單一有限厚度小孔洞對波散射產生之
 等效多極波源 (Multipole expansion) 作理論探討。其中最重要的成果則是完成了
電磁波系統，半無限域完美導體中一有限深度之半孔洞散射及有限厚度完美導
體薄板之穿透孔洞之散射波的高階多極散射展開式的求解。此一理論推導建構
 於前期相關研究計畫 (NSC 96-2221-E-001-001-)，聲波散射之對應系統。
另一項希望達到的目的，在探討利用求得的多極散射式，應用於多孔洞散
射的交互作用。

研究方法
 　　在電磁波散射問題上，本研究利用電磁場的雙元性 (duality) 來推導物理方
 程式。藉由定義電及磁之純量勢 (Electric and magnetic scalar potentials) 以及利
用勞倫茲(Lorentz) gauge condition規範其共軛之磁、電向量場勢來求解散射波。
透過此一規範，這些純量勢皆滿足純量波方程式，而得以與如聲波的純量場系
統對應。更進一步，磁純量勢能對應於聲波於硬邊界(Hard boundary) 散射，而
電純量勢能對應於聲波於軟邊界(Soft boundary) 散射。
　　由於孔洞遠小於波長，我們可將散射場區分為內域和外域，而在交界間的
中間尺度擬合。所謂小孔洞是為孔洞直徑、深度 ( )* *a ,l 遠小於入射波長 ( )*λ 的狀

Method of Matched Asymptotic Expansion, Crighton et al., 1992 ) 來求解多極波之
散射場。在內域，長度尺度為孔洞大小，無因次化分析後，首階波方程式簡化
為 Laplace方程式，即靜電、磁場(static electric/magnetic fields)，由此，我們可
應用 Fabrikant  (1989a,b)  針對圓孔洞勢流的解析方法求解。最終我們可得一完
成逆變換的無限線性方程組。由於這方程組是對稱系統，且每一矩陣中元素皆
為特定的特徵函數值，這使得我們得以用簡單的線性數值方法求解。重要的是，
雖然內域具有複雜的結構因素，該內域勢能理論得以推導出一綜合的散射因子，
透過擬合的程序，轉為外域的多極散射波源的等效振幅。
外域波傳場中，長度尺度則為波長。在半無限的空間中，我們可知其波方
 程解可表示為球體之協頻特徵函數 (Spherical harmonics)，這些特徵函數即一一
對應至多極波之模態。由於為滿足向外傳遞的波傳邊界條件(Outgoing wave

首先是 TM (Transverse Magnetic)入射至半孔洞之散射回波之多極波源。在此項
入射條件下，我們有散射波的多極波源如表一及表二。其中表一為磁純量勢及
其電向量勢的散射；而表二為電純量勢及其磁向量勢的散射。多極波源之強度，
即表中多極波源的各項係數，均為與孔洞深度相關之函數。如圖二與圖三所示。
該強度函數於孔洞深度約為半徑時達到飽和強度。
　　而 TE(Transverse Electric)入射下，則除了部份如表一之磁純量勢場解（並
 加以旋轉 -90度）之外，有增加如表三及圖四之多極波源。其中特殊的是有一
高階的磁單極波源且其強度正比於孔洞深度。(但這並不意味著發現一個物理上
的磁單極波源，因為該單極波源無法單獨存在。) 該波源及其來源機制，是高階
散射波效應所得。
　　在這項高階多極波源屬展開式的探討中我們可知，電磁波散射之起始項為
雙極波源，而其次則可拆分為二、四、及八極波源。這與慣有的多極波源之極
數遞增的意像並不一致。這應是由於孔洞的有限大小所產生的效應。

electromagnetic wave system, Scharstein and Davis [3] studied
the electromagnetic wave scattering of a two dimensional sub-
wavelength semi-circular trough in a ground plane. They also
used the method of matched asymptotic expansion to solve the
multipole structure of the scattering wave. Although the mul-
tipole expansion can be derived from these studies, the two-
dimensional wave is different from the three-dimensional coun-
terpart in that the colatitude variation does not exist in the former
configuration. This variation introduces asymmetry of the mul-
tipole structure and generates new multipoles when the incident
wave sheds obliquely on the pore and, to the authors’ knowledge,
has not yet been addressed.
Our motivation began with the renewed interests on electro-
magnetic waves incident on flat surfaces with designed structures
of small poles. For example, Garcia-Vidal, et. al. [4] have inves-
tigated the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculation of
the transmission of the wave through a single rectangular hole
in a perfect conductor plate, and Garcia de Abajo and Saenz [5]
have calculated the effective permittivity of a flat perfect conduc-
tor with such a pore structure to model surface plasmon on metal
surfaces. Further development of the present theory along this
direction would provide an alternative point of view on both the
near field and the far field radiation mechanisms of these emerg-
ing interests.
The problem of interest and its coordinate definition are
sketched in Fig. 1. There is a circular pore with a finite depth
drilled in a semi-infinite domain. The pore has a radius a∗ and a
finite depth ℓ∗. An incident plan wave is directed to the pore with
an incident angle ψ. Without the loss of generality, the coordi-
nate is chosen such that the y−component of the wavenumber, k∗y
vanishes, ie. symmetric with respect to the xz plane. The spheri-
cal coordinate (s∗,φ,θ) and the cylindrical coordinate (ρ∗,φ,z∗),
with ρ∗2 = x∗2 +y∗2 and s∗2 = x∗2 +y∗2 + z∗2, are used at appro-
priate occasions.
We first demonstrate the scattering of the acoustic wave for
both of the rigid and the pressure-release surface conditions.
Then the method is repeated for the electromagnetic wave scat-
tering of the same geometric configuration with a perfect con-
ducting surface.
ACOUSTIC WAVE SCATTERING
The wave equation with a time harmonic proportional to
exp(−iω∗t∗) is
(∇∗2 + k∗2)p∗(x∗,ω∗) = 0, (1)
where p∗ is the total sound pressure. Variables with an asterisk
superscript ∗ denote the dimensional physical quantities. ∇∗2 is
the Laplace operator and k∗2 is ω∗2/c∗2, where ω∗ and c∗ are
sound frequency and speed, respectively. The incident wave is
described by p∗inc = I∗ exp(ik∗xx∗− ik∗z z∗), where I∗ is the pressure
amplitude and k∗x = k∗kx = k∗ sin(ψ) and k∗z = k∗kz = k∗ cos(ψ).
There are two characteristic length scales: the wave length
1/k∗ for the outer region, far away from the pore, and the pore
radius a∗ for the inner region, which contains the flow field in
the pore and around the pore exit region. We normalize Eq. (1)
with respect to the characteristic scales for both inner and outer
regions:
(∇2i + ε2)p(x) = 0, and (∇2o +1)P(X) = 0, (2)
where x = x∗/a∗, X = k∗x∗. The sound pressure is normalized
against 2I∗. Because the acoustic wave length is much larger
than the pore radius, we have a small parameter ε = k∗a∗ such
that X = εx.
Interactions between the incident wave and the pore take
place in the inner region. We consider two perfect conditions:
the hard surface, or no penetration condition, i.e. ∂p∗/∂n∗ = 0,
and the pressure-release condition, p∗ = 0. The resultant inner
flow, which acts as multipole acoustic sources with determinable
strengths, is then matched to the outer wave field. The matching
process reveals the types of the multipole sources.
Rigid Reflective Surface
After normalizing the sound pressure by 2I∗, the external
wave field, the incident wave and its reflection by the rigid plane
is pext = cos(kzZ)exp(ikxX). It satisfies ∂p/∂z = 0 at z = 0. This
leads to the approximation in the inner flow region
pext = (1− ε

k2z z2)(1+ iεkxx−

k2xx2)+O(ε3), (3)
where the suffix ext represents the external forcing field.
From Eqs. (2)1 and (3), it is suggested that the inner expan-
sion for the total pressure is in the form of
p(x) = 1+ εp(1)(x)+ ε2 p(2)(x)+O(ε3). (4)

of the incident angle. Equations (8) and (9) can be solved easily
without the need for any special numerical algorithms because
the multiplier matrices are all symmetric.
To match with the outer wave field, we need to find the
far field approximation of the inner field. This can be found
by inspecting the integral representation of the scatter pressure,
Eq. (5), with Eq. (4)

where s2 = ρ2 + z2 is the distance from the origin to the observer

distance factor, the term in the second line of Eq. (10), can be

using Taylor series with an accuracy up to O((ρ0/s)4). Keeping
this accuracy ensures that the match to the outer wave region is
accurate up to O(ε5).
With Eq. (11), integrals in Eq. (10) can be integrated and,
with the expansion (6) or (7), the approximation becomes

where we have expressed s in terms of the outer variable S =
|X| = εs. The leading order is O(ε3) which consists of a
monopole and a dipole. It is followed by the multipoles at O(ε5).
The strength of the monopole is proportional to the pore depth,
ie. the pore volume. This volume effect also contributes to the
third term, the degenerated quadrupole (2,0), see the second line
of Eq. (12). The dependency on the spatial distance S indicates
the singularities seen from the outer radiation fields into the pore
near the origin and, with them, we match with the wave field
solution.
The scattering wave in the outer region satisfies the govern-
ing equation (2)2, the outgoing wave condition at infinity and the
rigid wall at Z = 0. From the expansion, (12), it is suggested that
the scattering wave can be written in the form of

where (S,φ,θ) is the spherical coordinate position variables for
Z ≥ 0. Coefficients B(3,5)mn are the strengths of the multipoles yet
to be determined. We use the combination (m,n) to indicate the
spherical modes and to distinguish the different types of multi-
poles. For example, (0,0) is a monopole and (1,0) and (1,1) are
the dipoles orienting in z and x directions. Function h(1)m (S) is the
spherical Hankel function of the first kind.
Letting S → 0 in Eq. (13) and equating it with Eq. (12), we

Calculation and Discussion
We solve the multipoles of the scattering wave in the last
section and obtain a set of infinite systems of algebraic equations,
Eqs. (8), (9) and (19), for the inner flows. The convergence prop-
erties of the inversed algebraic systems has been verified by Kuo
et al. [8], that if the coefficients are truncated to N=120 terms,
we produce an absolute error no more than approximately 0.015
at the singular pore exit corner. Therefore, we use N = 150 for
the monopole and 120 for the others. The coefficients ¯A(1,2)mn and
˜A(2)0n all converges to zero with alternating signs as n increases.
The equation sets are associated with inner flow fields of
the two orders of magnitudes and the different azimuthal modes,
as sketched in Figs. 2 and 3, for the two types of the boundary
conditions, respectively.
For the rigid surface, there are four fields. We omit the duct
field because of discontinuity in pressure after subtracting the ex-
ternal flow. The first order flow is a dipole field of (1,1) which
is induced by an external uniform flow parallel to the flanged
surface, Fig. 2(a). This flow vanishes when the wave is normally
incident on the pore and reaches the maximum when the incident
angle approaches 90◦. It has a directivity pattern of a two-lobed
structure. The second order inner flow is under the influence of
both the fluid compressibility and the incident angle. The small
but non-negligible compressibility allows the flow mass being
compressed/released slightly during the compressing/releasing
phase. This mechanism becomes a monopole source, as shown
in Fig. 2(b). The strength of the monopole is linearly propor-
tional to the storage capability of the pore, i.e. the depth. The
other two fields are associated with the incident angle and they
are quadrupoles of (2,0) and (2,2).
On the other hand, for the pressure-release surface, there are
only two inner fields. The first, Fig. 3(a), is a dipole of (1,0),
aligned vertically to the flanged surface. It has no azimuthal
dependence and is caused by a uniform flow normally onto the
pore. This dipole is maximized if kz = 1. The second order inner

the nonzero factor kxkz.
The far field scattering fields are tabulated in Table 1. The
leading terms for both types of the boundary conditions are of
O(ε3). For the rigid surface, it contains one monopole and
one dipole. Interestingly, the monopole arises from the second
order inner field and becomes the leading order of the wave
field because of its slower spatial decay rate, as pointed out in
Ref. [9]. The dipole is induced from the incident angle of the
external wave. The next order of magnitude of the scattering
wave is of O(ε5), which includes quadruples and octupoles. The

where we have expanded for the inner region to O(ε2) and ex-
pressed in the potential form. Notations eρ and ez are the unit
vectors in the ρ and z axes of the cylindrical coordinates. One
can easily check that the potentials satisfy the gauge condition,
Eq. (25)3 in the inner region. These external fields provide the
forcing to produce the scattering wave when a compact pore is
present at the origin.
The scalar potentials in the external field, Eq. (27), suggest
that there are contribution from the inner potentials
B(0,1) = ∇iψ(0,1)M , E(0,1) = ∇iψ
(0,1)
E .
For the perfect conducting surface, we have ψ(0,1)E = 0, the
Dirichlet condition, and ∂ψ(0,1)M /∂n = 0, the Neumann condi-
tion, on the boundaries for the vanishing surface electric com-
ponents and the vanishing normal magnetic component, respec-
tively. Both of the electric and magnetic scalar potentials satisfy
the Laplace equation.
In the pore, the potentials are expanded by the eigenfunc-
tions in the forms of
ψ(0,1)M = κ

where κ(0,1)M,m , κ
(0,1)
E,m are the incident factors, m is the azimuthal
mode and the coefficients ¯A(0,1)M,mn are defined.
We first solve for the magnetic scalar potentials, ψ(0,1)M . Be-
cause these potentials satisfies the Neumann boundary condition
on the conductor surface, the potentials are the same as the first
and the second orders of the acoustic scattering potentials of the
rigid condition, except that the acoustic incident wave factors ikx,
−k2x are replaced by 1 and ikx; the cosine functions are replaced
by the sines; and the ordering superscripts are lowered by 1 for
the electromagnetic waves. On the other hand, for ψ(0,1)E , we
reach the same integral equations for the scattering component,
analogous to the acoustic scattering with the pressure-release
boundaries, provided that the acoustic incident wave factors ikz
and kxkz are replaced by kx and −ik2x and the lowering of the
ordering superscripts.
We can obtain the main part of the radiation terms from the
aforementioned scalar potentials by the same procedures as for
the acoustic scattering. Referring to the complete scalar potential
radiations up to O(ε4), they are the first three terms in Tables 2
and 3. We borrow the multipole moments symbols of the acous-
tics for the scalar potentials for conveniences.
Furthermore, for the electromagnetic wave system, the phys-
ical fields can only be reconstructed with properly solved vector
potentials adjunct to the scalar ones with respect to the gauge
conditions. This leads to the major difference from the acoustics
that there are corrections for the radiation terms from the higher
order inner region, say O(ε2). They are the fourth potentials in
the tables and they are dipoles. We refer the details to Kuo et
al. [10] and only report the correction terms herein.
We are now to verify the leading order radiation of the mag-
netic and electric fields, associated with the magnetic potential,
Ψ(2)M,sc and the electric vector potential, Ξ

with a linear dependence on kz. This is a dipole aligning in ex
direction. The wave-guide mode associated with the incident
polarization is a TE mode. When kz = 1,(kx = 0), this dipole
becomes the same as that of the TM incident except that the co-
ordinate is rotated by −pi/2.
CONCLUSION
The scattering of acoustic and electromagnetic waves inci-
dent obliquely on a compact pore in a semi-infinite domain is
solved analytically using the method of matched asymptotic ex-
pansion. The wave length is assumed to be much larger than
the radius of the pore. The scattering field is, therefore, divided
into an inner flow field and an outer wave field. The inner field,
described by the Laplace or Poisson equation, is solved by the
method developed by Fabrikant, while the outer scattering field
is described by the wave equation. By the matching procedures,
we obtained uniformly valid multipole expansion solutions for
the wave systems.
The multiple expansions for acoustics are solved for both
rigid and pressure-release boundaries. They are summarized in
Table 1. For the rigid surface, there is a monopole which origi-
nates from the second order inner flow due to the small but non-
negligible compressibility. Its strength is linearly proportional to
the storage capability of the pore, the depth, owing to the extra
compressed mass being stored in the pore. The pore volume also
raises two accompanying components of the quadrupole (2,0),
whose strengths scale linearly with the pore depth. The other
multipoles are all induced by the incident angle and reach max-
ima when the incident wave is parallel to the surface.
On the other hand, the multipole structure is changed ac-
cordingly for the pressure-release condition. The leading field
is a dipole perpendicular to the pore exit and is followed by the
quadrupole (2,1) and the octupole (3,0). These waves all have a
common incident angle dependence of kz and disappear from the
investigated orders of magnitude when the incident wave is par-
allel to the flanged surface. There are no compressibility terms
arising in this case, as in the rigid boundary one.
For the electromagnetic waves, we formulate the source-free
Maxwell equations with the scalar and vector potentials based
on the duality property. The magnetic field corresponds to the
acoustic problem with the rigid boundary and the electric field
corresponds to that with the pressure-release condition. The ad-
ditions of the electromagnetic system are that for satisfaction of
the Lorentz gauge, there are corrections induced from the inner
region of higher orders. The solutions of the scalar electric and
magnetic potentials are tabulated in Tables 2, 3 and 4.
The only geometric effect of the pore after normalization
with respect to the pore radius is the depth. It modifies the
wave scattering through its influence on the moment coefficients.
The coefficients (except the pore volume related monopole and
quadrupole) are shown to vanish altogether when ℓ = 0 and to
asymptote to constant values when ℓ exceeds about 1. The de-
pendence of the incident angle is extracted as multiplier factors
of the multipole moment coefficients.
In the future, the expansion enables us to treat the pore as an
individual scatterer and, thus, to investigate the wave fields from
surfaces with various pore structures by formulating the mutual
interactions as multiple scattering processes, see Ishimaru [12].

Abstract
The scattering of an oblique electromagnetic wave incident on a compact circular
pore with a finite depth on the surface of a semi-infinite perfect conductor is inves-
tigated analytically. We use the method of matched asymptotic expansion to find
the multipole structure, where ǫ = k∗a∗, the product of the incident wave number
and the pore radius is a small parameter. The expansion is based on the duality
property of the source-free Maxwell equations and the resultant scattering fields
are fully expressed in terms of the auxiliary scalar and vector potentials. There are
two regions defined by the analytical method: the near field inner region and the
radiation outer region. Thorough solution in the inner region is expanded to O(ǫ)
and, in the outer region, to O(ǫ4), with the help of the gauge condition. The striking
finding is that the dipole accelerations, i.e. the vector potentials, though one order
smaller than the leading dipole scalar potentials in the inner region, become equal
in magnitude in the outer radiation region. The radiation of the electric and mag-
netic fields can only be correctly obtained by taking these dipole accelerations into
account. Similar structures are also found for higher order multipoles. Both of the
TM and TE polarized incidences are solved and the sophisticated three-dimensional
interplay between the pore depth and the incident angle is revealed. The theoreti-
cal investigation also lays the foundation for the future extension to the scattering
problem of a circular compact aperture in a perfect conductor plate with a finite
thickness.

structure of the scattering wave to the fourth order. Although a multipole expansion is derived, the
two-dimensional wave is different from the current interest of the three-dimensional problem: the
main difference is that the former is of the cylindrical wave type but the latter is of the spherical
one. But more importantly, the colatitude variation does not exist in the former configuration,
and this variation introduces asymmetry of the multipole structure and generates new multipoles
when the incident wave sheds obliquely on the pore.
Extensive theoretical work for the electromagnetic wave scattering by various aperture structures
in conducting screens has been done in the 70s to 80s, see [2, 4, 19] and references therein.
Most of the theories are developed by matching the tangential components of the physical fields
(electric or magnetic) at the joint plane of the aperture and the radiation domain. Closely related
to the current work, Roberts [19, 20] developed a rigorous method for the scattering from a
circular aperture in a perfect conducting plate with a finite thickness. Thorough calculations were
performed for wide ranges of incident angles and incident wavenumbers. Physical fields of the
near-field region were also demonstrated and rich patterns of scattering directivities were found
for large wavenumber incidence. On the other hand, explicit forms for the scattering can be
made with classical multipole expansions for small scatterers or pores. High order accuracy of the
scattering wave can be obtained by expansions involving polynomial series of the wave number:
Rayleigh series. Various procedures are developed. For example, Stenvenson [22] formulate a set
of integro-differential equations for magnetic currents in the series and solved for scattering due
to apertures of elliptic/circular shapes in infinitely thin plates.
In principle, the general purpose theories are applicable to out present problem, with additional ac-
counts for a wave guide section connecting to the pore. One way to incorporate the long wavelength
assumption with the aforementioned wave scattering theory is to find the asymptotic expansion
by directly manipulating the spherical harmonic functions. However, for providing an alterna-
tive physical intuition, we formulate the potentials using the duality property of the source-free
Maxwell equations - a scalar electric potential and its associated magnetic vector potential and
vice versa. Lorentz gauge condition is used to solve the potentials. Use of such gauge condition also
avoids the ambiguity of the Coulomb gauge whose potential is instantly seen in the propagation
field without the retarded time of wave propagation, [10].
For the same geometric configuration, Kuo, Chern and Chang [14] use the method of matched
asymptotic expansion to solve the acoustic scattering problem. Scalar variables, the pressure per-
turbations in different orders of magnitudes, are the primary physical variables. Both rigid and
pressure-release boundary conditions are solved. In this paper, we will show that the scalar vari-
ables are related to the scalar potentials in the electromagnetic waves. Hence, their method of
solution can be extensively applied herein and analogous comparison between the two systems are
made.
One of the peculiar property of the acoustic problem is that the compressibility effect occurring at
the second order inner solution produces a monopole radiation in the outer region in the leading
order. This is because the monopole has a small spatial decay rate compared to higher multipoles,
[3, 14]. In this paper, we will demonstrate that a similar theoretical structure also exists in the
scattering potentials of the electromagnetic wave system. It is associated with the conjugate vector
potential fields, induced by the leading scalar potentials, which are one order of magnitude smaller
3
and substituting into (1)2, we obtain an accompanying scalar potential Ψ
∗
E, such that
E∗ = iω∗A∗M +∇∗Ψ∗E. (3)
Choose the Lorentz gauge condition,
∇∗ ·A∗M +
iω∗
c∗2
Ψ∗E = 0, (4)
both of the potentials satisfy the wave equations
∇∗2Ψ∗E + k∗2Ψ∗E = 0, and ∇∗2A∗M + k∗2A∗M = 0. (5)
On the other hand, because of the symmetric form of the Maxwell equations, we can define a set
of dual potentials A∗E and Ψ
∗
M , such that
E∗ = −∇∗ ×A∗E, and B∗ =
iω∗
c∗2
A∗E +∇∗Ψ∗M . (6)
Similarly, the potentials satisfy the wave equations
∇∗2Ψ∗M + k∗2Ψ∗M = 0, and ∇∗2A∗E + k∗2A∗E = 0, (7)
under the gauge condition
∇∗ ·A∗E + iω∗Ψ∗M = 0. (8)
Equations (4), (5), (7) and (8) are now our system of governing equations and the physical fields
are calculated with (2), (3) and (6).
The scattering potential is induced by the geometrical non-uniformity of the pore. Since its length
scale is the pore radius, the potentials are nondimensionalized as
AM =
c∗
2|E∗inc|a∗
A∗M , ΨM =
c∗
2|E∗inc|a∗
Ψ∗M ,
and
AE =
1
2|E∗inc|a∗
A∗E, ΨE =
1
2|E∗inc|a∗
Ψ∗E,
where 2|E∗inc| is twice the electric amplitude of the incident wave.
There are two characteristic length scales when the scattering electromagnetic wave propagates
into the vacuum ambient. They are the wave length 1/k∗ for the outer wave propagation region,
far away from the pore, and the pore radius a∗ for the inner region which includes the field in the
pore and around the pore exit region. To find the equations for the outer region, we normalize (1)
with respect to the wave length:
(∇2o + 1)AM,E = 0, (∇2o + 1)ΨM,E = 0, ∇o ·AM,E = −iΨE,M , (9)
where subscript o stands for the outer region. The physical electro/magnetic fields, (3) and (6), in
the region are, hence
B = iǫAE + ǫ∇oΨM , E = iǫAM + ǫ∇oΨE. (10)
5
Near the pore exit, we nondimensionalize the external wave field and express it in an asymptotic
series with the inner spatial coordinate

where kx = sinα and kz = cosα.
To match with the field in the pore, it is convenient to recast (13) and (14) into the dual potentials.
They are

=∇iΨ(0)E,ext +∇i × A(1)E,ext +∇iΨ(1)E,ext +O(ǫ2), (16)
where eρ and ez are the unit vectors in the ρ and z axes of the cylindrical coordinates, (ρ, φ, z).
The subscript ext denotes the external incident field. One can easily check that the potentials
satisfy the gauge condition, (11)3 in the inner region. These external fields provide the forcing to
produce the scattering wave when a compact pore is present at the origin.
3.2 Scalar potentials and their radiation
The scalar potentials in the external field, (15), and (16), suggest that the contribution of the
inner potentials read
B(0,1) = ∇iΨ(0,1)M , E(0,1) = ∇iΨ(0,1)E ,
where the bracketed superscripts, (0,1) indicate the first two orders of the magnitude in ǫ of their
physical variables. For the perfect conducting surface, we have Ψ
(0,1)
E = 0, the Dirichlet condition,
and ∂Ψ
(0,1)
M /∂n = 0, the Neumann condition, on the boundaries for the vanishing surface electric
components and the vanishing normal magnetic component, respectively.

with an accuracy up to O(s−4). The spatial dependence indicates that there are two near field

region. Later, for satisfying the gauge condition, we find that there is an additional correction

In our present notation, we keep the directivity patterns in the primitive triangular function forms

On the other hand, for the electric potentials, Ψ

9
Similar to the magnetic potential, there is a correction term from the higher order inner region,
cf. (37), to complete the radiation field.
Equations (21) and (25) are the radiation fields induced by the leading order of the electric and
magnetic inner potentials. The characteristics of the inner static potentials are reported in Garcia
de Abajo and Saenz[8], on numerical investigations into the near field of the electromagnetic waves
near rectangular pores. These radiation potentials, however, are not able to completely describe
the physical radiation field because the dipole acceleration terms, appearing in the higher order
inner field, need to be taken into account. These high order terms that are also needed for solving
the scattering wave up to the accuracy of O(ǫ4) and are described in the following two sections.
3.3 Electric vector potential and associated higher order corrections
The vector potential in general has the cylindrical coordinate components
A
(1)
E = eρA

The complexity of the solving procedures is greatly simplified if we first inspect the potential in
the pore region. To satisfy the inner gauge condition, we can verify that the pore components can
be written in the form of

.
One can apply the method described in [17] to obtain the general form of the expansion, (27),
of the vector potential for any arbitrary azimuthal mode. However, we will present the explicit
expansion in this paper for simplicity.
The Cartesian components of the vector potential (26) with (27) read
11
coefficients E(1)n and F
(1)
n . In addition, from the incident angle dependent scattering potential,
Ψ
(4)
M22,sc of (21), we expect that there are corrections arising from the second higher order field
of the inner region, say of O(ǫ2). From the ordering argument: the terms that appear in O(ǫ2)
of the inner region and are just able to provide corrections to O(ǫ4) in the outer region must
decay spatially proportional to s−2 away from the pore. This indicates that they are at most of
the dipole radiation. The corrections are from the potentials Ψ
(2)
M and A

Poisson equation ∇2iΨ(2)M = −Ψ(0)M , ∇2iA(2)E = 0, (11)1,2, and the inner gauge condition.
For the present study, we shall not solve the complete inner solution for this order of magnitude
and above, and, therefore, we only need to determine the partial solution from the terms that
radiate into O(ǫ4) in the outer region. For this purpose, we denote the radiation of Ψ

M into the
outer region is Ψ˜M,sc. The overhead tilde, (˜.), represents the corrections from the higher order
inner solutions.

and construct the inner potential fields. For ℓ = 1.5, the convergence properties of the inversed
algebraic system, cf. Appendix A, has been verified in Kuo et al. [14], that if the coefficients are
truncated to N=120 terms, we produce an absolute error no more than approximately 0.01 at the
singular pore exit corner. Figs. 2(a) and (b) show the scattering potentials of O(1) and O(ǫ) on
the φ = π/2 and π/4 cut planes, and they are normalized by the incident angle factors 1 and
ikx, respectively. Our focus is drawn to the lobe structures of the multipole inner scattering fields.
They are respectively a dipole in the y−direction and a quadrupole of (2, 2). The fields in the
pore are not shown because their values are discontinuous across the pore exit by the value of the
external fields. For visual presentation of the total fields, we refer to Kuo, et al. [14]. The multipole
moments coefficients, the strengths of the radiation terms, B¯
(2,4)
Mmn and C¯
(2,4)
Emn , are the functions of
the pore depth ℓ, as depicted in Figs. 3. They all increases from zero as increasing of ℓ from zero
and saturate to their constant values when ℓ is larger than about 1.
Another striking feature is that the multipoles are not organized in a strictly ascending manner
but exhibit an intervened structure. For example, in O(ǫ4) of the radiation field, the scattering
scalar potential wave is composed of an octupole, a quadrupole and a dipole and the Cartesian
components of the electric vector potential consist of quadrupoles and dipoles. This is due to the
finite size effect of the pore.
Till now, we only use the gauge condition to determine the unknown coefficients for the radiation.
We need to verify if the solution satisfies the boundary condition in the pore. The electric field
reads

It is clearly seen that the field fulfills the vanishing tangential electric field on the perfect conduct-
ing surface in the pore. The zero z−component in the pore indicates that the conjugate electric
field with the magnetic scalar potential is associated with a transverse electric (TE) wave-guide
mode. The normal component of the vector potential vanishes on the conducting surface and this

which obviously corresponds to a TM wave-guide mode. Across the pore exit, the magnetic vector
potential bears the same continuity property as its electric counterpart. In addition, the magnetic
vector potential has a physical interpretation, which is a field momentum available for exchange
with the kinetic momenta of charged matter in the field, [13]. From this point of view, it is found
that the external field momentum by the incident wave, containing only the ρ−component (15),
does not change its direction and enter the pore as if the pore does not exist. This causes the
peculiar property. We cannot, however, apply the same comment to the electric vector potential
discussed in the former section because there is no known similar physical association.

is clearly seen from their lobate structure that the formal is a vertical dipole and the latter is a
quadrupole (2, 1). Varying ℓ, we obtain the multipole moment coefficients as functions of the pore
depth, Fig. 5. They show the common characteristics of the previous magnetic scalar potentials
that they are zero at ℓ = 0 and saturate to their respective constant values when ℓ is larger than
about 1. In addition, the multipoles all vanish when the incident wave is normally shed on the
pore because of their dependence on the factors kx and k

in the spherical coordinate. This is the resultant field of an electric dipole aligning in the ez
direction at the pore exit. The TM suffix indicates that the fields are associated with a TM
wave guide mode in the pore. The vertical dipole strength is −kxB¯(2)E10 and, because it is linear
proportional to kx, excitation of this mode depends on the nonzero inclination angle. A physical
intuition of the dependence of the incident angle can be drawn that the nonzero incident angle
introduces an external electrical forcing normal to the pore and, hence, creates voltage potential
differences in the depth-wise direction and results in the vertical dipole radiation.
19
Observing the form of the scalar potentials between (38) and those, (15), in the TM incidence, we
conclude that the first two terms are readily associated with the magnetic scalar potentials found
in the previous section, but with an additional incident factor kz and with the triangular sine
functions of the azimuthal angles replaced by the cosines. Trivial adjustments, e.g. the component
orientations, are also needed for their conjugate vector potentials and they can be found straight-
forwardly using the gauge condition. For brevity, they are not rederived here, and the solution in
Table 1 holds (with the incident angle and directivity adjustment, see the caption).

with a linear dependence on kz. The wave-guide mode associated with the incident polarization
is a TE mode. It is simply the dipole field (36) with the factor kz, accounting for the horizontal
component of the incident magnetic field, and with a rotation with respect to the z−axis by −π/2,
ie. φ→ φ+ π/2.
23
The dependence of the incident angle is extracted as multiplier factors for the multipole moment
strengths. The only geometric effect of the pore after normalization with respect to the pore
radius is the depth. It modifies the wave scattering through its influence on the effective multipole
moment coefficients, B¯
(2,4)
MEmn and C¯
(2,4)
EMmn . The coefficients are shown to vanish altogether at ℓ = 0.
For TM incidence, the coefficients asymptote to their respective constant values when ℓ exceeds
about 1. On the other hand, for TE incidence, the non-vanishing pore depth-wise magnetic field
induces radiation multipoles of O(ǫ4) whose strengths are linearly proportional to the pore depth.
The incident factors also reveal the alternation of the induced wave guide modes in the pore.
When the wave is normally shed on the pore, kx = 0, only the TE mode in the pore is excited.
When the incident wave is inclined with a non-zero z−component of the electric field, the TM
wave guide mode is raised.
The leading dipole fields for both of the incident polarizations are explicitly calculated for verifi-
cation with the textbook examples, [10]. For the magnetic scalar potential, the dipole lies on the
horizontal xy plane and, for the electric scalar potential, the dipole is vertical to the pore exit.
The present theory can be further extended for the scattering of compact pores in perfect con-
ducting plates with a finite thickness. Similar analytical multipole structures can be obtained for
both reverse scattered and transmitted waves and allow us to investigate the effect of the plate
thickness in accordance with the classical Bethe’s solution, [1]. In the future, the expansion en-
ables us to treat the pore as an individual scatterer and, thus, to investigate the wave fields from
surfaces with various pore structures by formulating the mutual interactions as multiple scattering
processes, see Garcia de Abajo [7], Ishimaru [12].

Abstract
We present an approach to the problem of electromagnetic scattering by a subwavelength circular
hole in a perfect metal plate of finite thickness. The matched asymptotic expansion is employed
to solve the scattered fields in the inner and outer regions with respect to the hole position. By
use of the dual potentials and Fabrikant’s theory, the solutions are expressed as a combination of
special functions. In particular, the scattering behavior is illustrated with the near-field quasistatic
potentials as well as the far-field radiation patterns. The effect of plate thickness is manifest on the
attenuation of dipole strengths associated with the subwavelength hole. For a large thickness, the
dipole strengths approach the values for an infinitely deep hole, while for a very small thickness,
the results coincide with the Bethe theory.

beneath the plate) perpendicular to metal plane and/or a pair of magnetic dipoles parallel
to it. For TM incidence (where the incident magnetic field is oriented along the metal
plane), both the electric and magnetic dipole pairs are present. For TE incidence (where
the incident electric field is oriented along the metal plane), only the magnetic dipole pair
appears. The presence of plate thickness introduces the cavity modes in the hole and results
in a strength difference between the upper and lower dipoles. As the thickness increases, the
dipole strengths attenuate and asymptotically approach the values for a hole with infinite
depth [22]. On the other hand, as the plate thickness is reduced to zero, the dipole strengths
reach their maximum values and coincide with the results of Bethe’s theory [4].

FIG. 1: Schematic of a subwavelength hole in a perfect metal plate of finite thickness.
II. MATCHED ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSION
A. Overview
Consider a hole of radius a∗ in a perfect metal plate of finite thickness 2l∗, as shown in Fig.
1. The electromagnetic radiation with wavelength λ∗ is incident from the above. The domain
of interest is conceptually divided into the inner and outer regions, which correspond to the
near and far fields with respect to the hole position (cf. Fig. 2). The corresponding inner
and outer coordinates are characterized by the hole radius a∗ and wavelength λ∗ = 2pi/k∗,
respectively. The condition that the hole size is much smaller than the wavelength gives rise
to a small parameter ε ≡ k∗a∗ ≪ 1, defined as the product of wave number and hole radius.
For convenience in solving the problem, the dual potentials are introduced to represent the
fields. By use of the perturbation technique, the potentials are expanded as a series of ε,
3
where the asterisk symbol denotes the dimensional quantity. Introducing the dual potentials
ψ∗e and A
∗
m, the fields can be expressed as
B∗ = ∇∗ ×A∗m, E∗ = ∇∗ψ∗e + iω∗A∗m. (3)
In virtue of the duality between E∗ and B∗ in Eqs. (1)−(2), the fields are alternatively
expressed by another dual potentials ψ∗m and A
∗
e as
E∗ = −∇∗ ×A∗e, B∗ = ∇∗ψ∗m +
iω∗
c∗2
A∗e. (4)
In the above two formulations, the dual potentials satisfy the Helmholtz equations
∇∗2ψ∗e(m) + k∗2ψ∗e(m) = 0, ∇∗2A∗m(e) + k∗2A∗m(e) = 0, (5)
and are constrained by the Lorentz gauge conditions
∇∗ ·A∗m +
iω∗
c∗2
ψ∗e = 0, ∇∗ ·A∗e + iω∗ψ∗m = 0. (6)
C. Inner and outer variables
In the inner and outer regions, the dimensionless coordinates are defined as x ≡ x∗/a∗
and X ≡ k∗x∗, respectively. The inner and outer coordinates are therefore connected by the
small parameter ε; that is, X = εx. In addition, the fields are normalized as B ≡ B∗c∗/2E∗inc
and E ≡ E∗/2E∗inc, where E∗inc is the magnitude of incident electric field. Meanwhile, the dual
potentials are normalized as ψe ≡ ψ∗e/2E∗inca∗, Am ≡ A∗mc∗/2E∗inca∗, ψm ≡ ψ∗mc∗/2E∗inca∗,
and Ae ≡ A∗e/2E∗inca∗. Accordingly, Eqs. (3)−(6) are rewritten in the inner region as
E = ∇iψe + iεAm −∇i ×Ae, (7)
B = ∇iψm + iεAe +∇i ×Am, (8)(
∇2i + ε2
)
ψe(m) = 0,
(
∇2i + ε2
)
Am(e) = 0, (9)
∇i ·Am(e) + iεψe(m) = 0, (10)
and in the outer region as
E = ε∇oψe + iεAm − ε∇o ×Ae, (11)
B = ε∇oψm + iεAe + ε∇o ×Am, (12)(
∇2o + 1
)
ψe(m) = 0,
(
∇2o + 1
)
Am(e) = 0, (13)
∇o ·Am(e) + iψe(m) = 0, (14)

where x ≡ x∗/a∗, z ≡ z∗/a∗, l ≡ l∗/a∗, kx ≡ k∗x/k∗ = sinϕ, kz ≡ k∗z/k∗ = cosϕ, and ϕ is
the incident angle with respect to the plane normal. Using Taylor’s expansions about x = 0
and z = l, we have

Comparing the above expressions with Eqs. (17) and (18), one concludes that

ψ
(1)
e,ext,+ = −ik2x (z − l) ρ cosφ, ψ(1)m,ext,+ =

In the lower half space (z ≤ −l, denoted by the subscript ’−’), there is neither incident nor
reflected field. Therefore, Bext,− = Eext,− = 0 and ψ
(0,1)
e,ext,− = ψ
(0,1)
m,ext,− = 0.
F. Potentials of scattered fields
The potentials in the inner region satisfy the Laplace equation [cf. Eq. (19)]. On the
surface of prefect metal plate (ρ ≥ 1, z = ±l), the tangential electric and normal magnetic
fields vanish; equivalently, ψ(0,1)e = ∂ψ
(0,1)
m /∂z = 0. Using the method of images and Green’s
second identity, the scattered potentials can be written in integral from as [20]

Note that ψ(0)e is normalized by −kx, the same factor appearing on the right side of Eq.

The scattered potential ψ(0)m,sc in Fig. 3(d) corresponds to a pair of magnetic dipoles oriented
parallel to the metal plane. The upper and lower dipoles are directed rightward (+y axis)
and leftward (−y axis), respectively. This feature is also similar to the case of zero thickness
[24]. Likewise, the lower dipole strength is weaker due to the plate thickness. In Fig. 3(d),
the potential lines in the hole region are blanked. This is because ψ(0)m,sc and ψ
(0)
m,hole do not
have the same value at the upper hole exit. To avoid confusion, only ψ(0)m,sc are plotted. The
dipole feature of the subwavelength hole will be revisited in the outer solutions in Sec.

The scattered potential ψ(1)m,sc in Fig. 4(d) corresponds to a pair of magnetic quadrupoles
oriented parallel to the metal plane. For a better illustration, the viewing plane is chosen
to be φ = pi/4, where the incident external potential has a largest magnitude [cf. Eq.
(30)]. At another viewing plane where φ = 3pi/4, the potential lines possess a likewise
distribution. This feature indicates that the corresponding quadrupole is formed by two
mutually perpendicular dipoles. Likewise, the lower quadrupole strength is weaker due to
the plate thickness. In Fig. 4(d), the potential lines in the hole region are blanked for the
same reason in Fig. 3(d).

I. Far-field limits of the inner solutions

equal to the near-field limit of the outer solution [19]. The scattered potentials (31) and

K. Radiation fields and effective dipole moments
The solutions in the outer region are further represented by the radiation fields of the
effective dipole moments associated with the subwavelength hole. In particular, the scatter-
ing field of a small hole in an infinitesimally thin plate can be considered as caused by an
electric dipole perpendicular to the metal plane and a magnetic dipole parallel to it [4]. This
feature retains in the case of finite plate thickness and is manifest on the radiation feature
of the outer solutions.

numerical results for an infinitely deep hole [22]: |p+| ≈ 1.138 and |m+| ≈ 1.876.
between |p+| and |p−| arises as the thickness increases. In the limit as the thickness goes to
zero, the dipole strengths coincide with the analytical result of Bethe’s theory [Eq. (73)]. On
the other hand, |p+| approaches an asymptotic value 1.138 at large thickness. This value is
very close to the numerical result (4pi5/2/61.5) of the normalized electric dipole strength for
a circular hole with infinite depth [22]. Meanwhile, |p−| decreases to zero at large thickness.

dual potentials and Fabrikant’s theory, the solutions were expressed in terms of special
functions. The matched asymptotic expansion was employed to seek for a solution in the
form of a perturbation series, which link together the inner and outer solutions with different
characteristics. On the one hand, the inner solutions depict the quasistatic nature in the
near field by the multipolar structure of potential contours. On the other hand, the outer
solutions exhibit the wave nature in the far field through the dipole radiation forms. The
effect of plate thickness was manifest on the attenuation of dipole strengths associated with
the hole between two extremes. For a large thickness, the dipole strengths asymptotically
approach the values for an infinitely deep hole. For a very small thickness, the dipole
strengths coincide with the analytical results of Bethe’s theory.

ABSTRACT
The three dimensional wave scattering of an oblique wave
incident on a flanged circular compact pore of finite depth is
solved analytically by the method of matched asymptotic expan-
sion. We assume smallness of the product of the incident wave
number and the pore radius and divide the scattering field into an
inner region and an outer radiation region. For the wave system,
the physical variables, e.g. sound pressure, electric/magnetic
fields, satisfy the Laplace equation in the inner region. For the
circular shaped pores, they can be solved by the method devel-
oped by Fabrikant. Then via the matching processes, the wave
radiation in the outer field is determined. The theory is devel-
oped first for sound wave scattering. Both rigid and pressure-
release boundary conditions are investigated. For a pore with
a finite depth, the leading radiation terms for both conditions
are at the same order of magnitude. They contain one monopole
and one dipole for the former and one dipole for the latter.
Quadrupoles and an octupole are found in the next higher or-
der. Subsequently, the theory is applied to the electromagnetic
wave scattering. The problems are formulated based on the du-
ality property of the source-free Maxwell equations. A multipole
expansion for the scattering wave similar to the acoustic coun-
terpart is obtained. A few residue multipoles arising from the
higher order inner region are found. The leading dipoles and

INTRODUCTION
We investigate the scattering of acoustic and electromag-
netic waves incident on a small circular pore with a finite depth
in a semi-infinite flat surface. The radius and the depth of the
pore are both assumed to be much smaller than the wavelength
of the incident waves. Under these circumstances, a multipole
expansion is appropriate for understanding the mechanisms be-
cause of its ability to illustrate the physics in different orders of
magnitude and to express the multipole moments, or strengths,
explicitly in closed forms. The method of matched asymptotic
expansion is often used to solve for the expansion. In the method,
the entire wave propagation domain is divided into two regions
according to their characteristic length scales: the inner region,
for the area near/in the pore and the outer region, for the wave
radiation. The compactness of the pore is measured by a small
parameter ε, which is defined by the product of the incident wave
number k∗ and the radius of the pore a∗. The pore depth ℓ∗, being
compact, is, therefore, comparable to a∗.
In the literature, only a few references are related to the
three-dimensional configuration of the present study. A very
brief note was presented by Sato and Shirai [1] on sound wave
transmission through ducts in thick walls. The diffraction of a
two-dimensional flanged duct with external incident waves has
been solved numerically by Shenderov [2]. In two-dimensional

The first term on the right hand side is the leading term of the
external field. It is a uniform field in the inner region. The rest of
the terms contain the induced scattering fields and higher orders
of the external field. Substitution of Eq. (4) into Eq. (2)1 leads to
the governing equations of the two orders
∇2i p(1) = 0, ∇2i p(2)+1 = 0, etc.
The equations also hold for the pressure in the pore region.
The inner region consists of two zones. They are one semi-
infinite flow region, z≥ 0, and the cylindrical pore region, ρ = 1,
and −ℓ ≤ z ≤ 0. Let us define the total pressure in the semi-
infinite zone and the pore region as p(x) and ppore(ρ,φ,z), re-
spectively. The inner solution can be constructed by match-
ing the solutions of the two zones at the pore exit, z = 0 and
ρ ≤ 1. This is typically known as a mixed boundary value prob-
lem. Mathematical theories and other applications of the relevant
problems can be found in monographs, such as Sneddon [6] and
Fabrikant [7].

sc (ρ,φ,z),
The terms p(1)ext and p
(2)
ext are the external incident forcings and
they are ikxx and −(k2xx2 + k2z z2)/2, respectively. The second
terms, denoted as p(1,2)sc (ρ,φ,z), are the near-field scattering,
which is obtained by using the semi-infinite Green function with
a vanishing normal derivative at z = 0. We use the abbreviation
s2 = ρ20+ρ2+z2−2ρρ0 cos(φ−φ0) for the square of the distance
between two points (ρ,φ,z) and (ρ0,φ0,0) in the cylindrical co-
ordinate. The evaluation symbol |< represents that the operand
is evaluated in the region ρ ≤ 1 at z = 0 or ρ0 ≤ 1 at z0 = 0,
whichever is appropriate.
Because the surface sources, (∂p(1,2)/∂z0)|<, are still an
unknown, it needs to be solved by matching with the pressure
condition in the pore. For this purpose, we bring the observa-
tion point (ρ,φ,z) to the pore exit, ie. ρ ≤ 1, z = 0. At the
exit, we have the pressure continuity, p(1,2)pore |< = p(1,2) = p(1,2)ext +
p(1,2)sc |<, and the pressure derivative continuity, (∂p(1,2)pore /∂z)|< =
(∂p(1,2)/∂z)|<. With these conditions, we reach an integral equa-

which uses the pore pressure as unknowns. This is a Fredholm
equation of the first kind. We have omitted the arguments (ρ,φ,z)
in p(1,2)pore and ∂p(1,2)pore /∂z0 and abbreviated se = s|z=0 for simplicity.
The pressure in the pore region can be written as a linear

where m is the azimuthal modal number and j′mn is the nth zero of
the derivative of the mth order of the Bessel function of the first
kind, ie. J′m( j′mn) = 0. Parameter κ(1,2)m is the incident factors
of the correspondent azimuthal mode. The symmetry condition
with respect to the y= 0 plane leads to the sole dependence on the
azimuthal factor cos(mφ). There is one exception in the second
order, which reads

The extra second term on the right hand side accounts for the
pore volume contribution, which is linearly proportional to the
pore depth.
Substitution Eq. (6), or Eq. (7), into Eq. (5), we obtain a
set of integral equations for the two orders of magnitude and the
different azimuthal modes. Each of the integral equation can be
solved elegantly by the method proposed by Fabrikant [7] and
this yields an infinite linear algebraic systems for the coefficients,
say one of A(1,2)mn . The details are referred to Kuo et al. [8].

inversed explicit forms, see Appendix, are primarily dependent
on the azimuthal mode number rather than on the orders of mag-
nitude, the superscripts (1) and (2). For the zeroth and the first
orders, it is convenient to define the incident factors as κ(1)1 = ikx,

Pressure-release Surface
The pressure-release condition gives p(x) = 0 on the bound-
ary surface. As in Sec. , we carry out the inner flow up to the
second order accuracy. The external incident and reflected waves
over a pressure-release surface at z = 0 are
pext =−iεkzz+ ε2kxkzxz+O(ε3),
after normalizing by 2I∗. We denote p(1)ext = −ikzz and p(2)ext =
kxkzxz and their derivatives with respect to z are−ikz and kxkzx =
kxkzρcosφ, respectively. This expansion indicates that the to-
tal pressure expansion of the inner region is p(x) = εp(1)(x)+
ε2 p(2)(x) and, subsequently, the pressures, p(1) and p(2), satisfy
the Laplace equations, see Eq. (2)1.
The nondimensionalized total pressures in the inner flow re-
gion can be written down straightforwardly using the same Green
function in Sec.

Substitute Eqs. (18) and (21) into Eq. (20) and replace s by S/ε,
we have the singularities seen from the outer radiation field. This
is similar to expression (12) but with a different multipole expan-

quadrupole (2,0) has the most complicated structure and is un-
der the influence of both the fluid compressibility and the inci-
dent angle. For the pressure released condition, the fluid com-
pressibility does not have any influential effects and the multi-
pole structure is simpler than the former case. The leading term
is still a dipole, but vertically to the flanged surface and is maxi-
mized when the incident wave is normally onto the pore.
Figures 4 and 5 sketch the multipole moment coefficients,
¯B(3,5)mn and ˜B(3,5)mn versus the pore depth ℓ. They all vanish when
the depth is zero, which degenerates to the perfect reflection, and
saturates to constant values when the depth is about 1.
ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE SCATTERING
We consider in this section the electromagnetic wave scatter-
ing by the same pore. The boundary surface is assumed perfect
conducting. The incident polarization is defined in Fig. 1(b) and
the incident electric field amplitude is |E∗inc|.
The source-free Maxwell equations exhibit duality proper-
ties, so that we can define the dual pairs of potentials
(Ψ∗M,ξ∗E), (Ψ∗E ,ξ∗M),
where Ψ∗M,E and ξ∗E,M are the scalar and vector potentials and the
subscripts M and E denote the magnetic and the electric associa-

in the spherical coordinate. We have also omitted terms smaller
than O(S−2) for clarity. The wave guide mode associated with
the radiation is TE polarized and, hence, the T E suffix is affili-
ated. Comparing to the field radiation of a magnetic dipole, e.g.
page 457 in [11], this is a dipole aligning in the ey direction at the
pore exit. Similarly, we can find the radiation induced by Ξ(2)E,sc,

This is the resultant field of an electric dipole aligning in the ez

are associated with a TM wave guide mode in the pore.

The former, the horizontal magnetic dipole, is independent of
the incident angle and this is because the non-vanishing mag-
netic field on the boundary surface is supported and, under TM
polarized incidence, it is not changed by the incident angle. The
latter, the vertical electric dipole, is linear proportional to the in-
cident factor kx, which vanishes when the incident wave is nor-
mally onto the pore. A physical intuition of the dependence of
the incident angle can be drawn is that the nonzero incident angle
introduces an external electrical forcing normal to the pore and,
hence, creates voltage potential differences in the depth-wise di-
rection and results in the dipole radiation.
Transverse Electric Polarized Incidence
The external wave field of the transverse electric polarized
incidence is

where they have been nondimensionalized for the inner region
and expressed in the potential form.
Only magnetic scalar potentials exist in the forcings and,
therefore, only the magnetic scalar potential scattering is in-
duced. Observing the form of the external scalar potential forc-
ings with the TM incidence, we conclude that the first two terms
are readily solved. The correspondent solution is tabulated in Ta-
ble 2, but here with an additional incident factor kz and with the
triangular sine functions of the azimuthal angles replaced by the
cosines, see the caption of the table.
The still unsolved potential, now, is the first order magnetic
scalar potential, ψ(1)M of the azimuthal mode m = 0. This mode
appears in the acoustic scattering as well and it corresponds to
m = 0 of Eq. (8). Interestingly, with the gauge condition, we
find that there is a residue magnetic scalar monopole associated
with this mode. This monopole results from O(ε3) of the inner
region and radiates to O(ε4) in the outer radiation region. Table 4
summarizes the radiation terms of this zero azimuthal mode.
