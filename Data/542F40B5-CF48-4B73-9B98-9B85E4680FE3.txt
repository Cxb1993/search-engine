goiter, hypothyroidism, and mental retardation, 
nevertheless, excess intake of it can cause 
hyperthyroidism. Recently, nanostructured electrodes such 
as nanocomposites of polyoxometallates[11], conducting 
polymer[12], and redox active molecule functionalized 
conducting polymer[13] electrodes have been successfully 
prepared for the catalyzing iodate reduction. 
In this work, CTAB is applied for the preparation of 
PB films. The properties of the CTAB-modified PB films 
have been investigated. Moreover, CTAB is applied for 
the preparation of a nanostructured 
poly(5-amino-2-naphthalene sulfonic acid) modified 
glassy carbon electrode (GCE/nPANS). The 
electrochemical properties of the GCE/nPANs and its 
electrocatalytic effect on iodate reduction are studied. 
2. Experimental methods 
2.1 Chemicals and instruments 
FeCl3 (97%), K3Fe(CN)6 (>99%), KCl (99%), HCl 
(37%), ANS (95%), and CTAB (99%) are all purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium iodate (KIO3) is obtained 
from Wako Chemicals (Japan). CTAB (99%) is purchased 
from Merck. All of them are used without further 
purification. Deionized water (DIW) with 18.2 MΩ of 
resistance is used. A potentiostat/galvanostat, CHI 440 
(CH Instruments), and a spectrophotometer (model 
UV-1601PC, Shimadzu, Japan) are used. 
2.2 Preparation of PB films 
The precursor solution for PB deposition is composed 
of 0.5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 0.5 mM FeCl3, 0.02 M HCl, and 
0.1 M KCl. For CTAB-modified PB, 0.92 mM CTAB is 
included in the precursor solution. Cyclic voltammetry 
(CV) is applied for the electrodeposition of 
CTAB-modified PB and unmodified PB thin films on the 
Au and GCE. The potential of the electrode is scanned 
between -0.1 and 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at a rate of 100 
mV/s. 
2.3 Preparation of GCE/nPANs 
Prior to modification, a GCE is polished with 0.05 
µm alumina on Buehler felt pads and then ultrasonically 
cleaned for 10 min in deionized water (DIW). Finally, the 
GCE is washed thoroughly with DIW. After being cleaned, 
the GCE is immersed into 0.1 M KCl solution containing 
1 mM ANS and 1 mM CTAB for electrodeposition of a 
nPANS modification layer on the GCE. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Analyses of PB films by cyclic voltammetry and 
UV-Vis Spectrophotometer 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is used to deposit the 
CTAB-modified PB thin film on an Au electrode (0.196 
cm2), with a charge of 0.50 mC. A comparison between 
the CVs in Fig. 1(A) and 1(B) indicates that the peak 
separation in the case of the CTAB-modified PB film is 
lower than that in the case of the unmodified film. This 
lower peak separation indicates that the electron transfer is 
faster in the case of the modified film; this is especially 
beneficial for the use of PB as a mediator for biosensors[14]. 
It is well known that the redox peak separation reflects the 
resistance for the electrochemical reaction. That is, the 
reaction is rather difficult to occur if the oxidation peak is 
located at more positive potential and deviated from its 
formal potential, during the oxidation of the PB molecule 
from Everitt■?s salt state to Prussian blue state; this 
situation holds good conversely.  
From Fig. 1(A) and 1(B), there is one pair of redox 
peaks between -0.1 and 0.6 V; this reflects the equilibrium 
spectrum and indicates that the film is completely reduced 
to Prussian white state at -0.1 V and is totally oxidized to 
Prussian blue state at 0.6 V. Therefore, the proper 
operation potential window for Prussian blue film is 
considered to be from -0.1 V to 0.6 V. A maximal 
transmittance difference within the potential window can 
be observed at the wavelength of 690 nm (data not shown). 
The CTAB-modified PB film has the same trend for 
absorbance change, as that in the case of the unmodified 
film, and apparently its most distinct transmittance 
difference occurs at 690 nm as well (data not shown).

unmodified PB thin film in 0.1 M KCl at the scan rates of 
3, 5, 7, 10, 30, 50, 70, 100 mV/s. 
 
3.2 Preparation of GCE/nPANs by CV 
Fig. 2 shows the cyclic voltammogram recorded 
during the preparation of GCE/nPANS. It can be found 
that in the first cycle, an irreversible anodic peak was 
noticed at ca. 0.7 V, which is attributed to the oxidation of 
amino group of ANS to a radical cation, and then to a

Manne et al.[17] discovered via in situ AFM experiments 
that surfactants self assemble at the electrode surfaces as 
bilayers on hydrophilic surfaces and as monolayers on 
hydrophobic surfaces. On the basis, Senthil Kumar et al. 
[18] documented the way of formation of bilayer and 
orientation of CTAB molecules on GCE surface; the 
cationic surfactant can adsorb onto the GCE surface 
preferentially with its polar head group forming surfactant 
self-assembly, followed by a second monolayer of CTA+ 
molecules organizing on top of the first layer forming a 
bilayer as a result of lateral hydrophobic interaction 
amongst the neighboring tail groups, and exposing the 
second polar end of the surfactant to the aqueous solution. 
Therefore, during electrochemical polymerization of ANS 
in the presence of CTAB, negatively charged ANS is 
electrostatically attracted by positively charged head 
group of CTAB. Thus, electrostatic attractive force 
facilitates the formation of well-grown nanostrucutred 
PANS polymer film. Also this electrostatic attractive force 
may also acts as driving force to the formation of 
nanoribbon like structure of PANS[19]. 
 
3.5 Electrochemical studies of the GCE/nPANS 
The effect of scan rate on the GCE/nPANS is 
investigated. As revealed in Fig. 5, it is observed that 
anodic peak currents (at 0.27 V) are directly proportional 
to scan rate over the range of 10-500 mV/s, indicating 
redox process is surface confined and a facile charge 
transfer kinetics. The surface coverage (Γ) of the 
GCE/nPANS is obtained by integrating area under anodic 
peak and is found to be 1.6Ø10-10 mol/cm2 (n=2). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5 Plot of anodic peak current versus scan rate. 
 
The formal potential of the GCE/nPANS is also 
investigated. As shown in Fig. 6, upon an increase of pH 
from 1 to 6, a shift of the formal potential for the redox 
reaction of PANS to more negative values, a decrease of 
the redox current, and an increase in the separation 
between anodic and cathodic peaks are noticed. This 
indicates that the redox properties of nanostructured 
PANS electrode are pH dependent. The smaller redox 
peak currents, with increased pH, might be due to the 
reason that the amount of electroactive species is less. The 
plot of the formal potential versus pH (Fig. 6) is linear 
with the slope -51 mV/pH (close to -59 mV/pH), 
indicating that equal number of protons and electrons take 
part in the redox reaction of the polymer.

3.6 Electrocatalytic reduction of iodate on the 
GCE/nPANS 
The GCE/nPANS is used for the catalyzing the 
reduction reaction of iodate. Since protons are required for 
iodate reduction[20], 0.2 M HNO3, is chosen for the study 
on electrocatalytic behavior of iodate at the GCE/nPANS. 
As revealed in Fig. 7, the electro-reduction of iodate at 
GCE requires a large overpotential, and no obvious peak 
was observed in the range from +0.6 to -0.2 V in 0.2 M 
HNO3. However, with an addition of iodate, significant 
increase in reduction peak current along with decrease in 
oxidation peak current was observed in the case of PANS 
modified GCE, indicating that nanostructured PANS 
electrode shows remarkable electrocatalytic activities 
towards the reduction iodate ions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 7 CVs of the PANS modified GCE, prepared with 1 
mM CTAB in 0.2 M HNO3 solution containing zero and 2 
mM iodate. Scan rate is 10 mV/s. 
 
On the basis of the voltammetric results described 
above, the nanostructured PANS electrode was further 
subjected to the amperometric detection of iodate at a 
relatively positive applied potential of 0.15 V in a 
magnetically stirred 0.2 M HNO3 solution. Fig. 8 shows

穩定性與高效能之質子交換膜以及燃料電池模組最適化等議題，也有部分研究是針對染料敏化
太陽能電池之相關研究，包含了電解質的部分以及相關氧化還原對之機制等。而我的海報報告
的主題為「Fabrication of metal-based flexible photoanodes for DSSCs by incorporating TNT as a 
scattering layer」係屬於染料敏化太陽能電池發展與應用底下之相關研究。 
在大會主席的致詞中揭開了此次大會的序幕，接著便是會議所邀請的演講者。另外的壁報
討論時間分別安排在8月29號至9月3號，也就是會議開始的第2天至最後一天，現場參與的學者
無不熱烈關切討論，交流彼此的研究經驗。由於會場中所發表之海報大多著重在燃料電池等議
題之分析及材料的應用，對於染料敏化太陽能電池在會場中並不算是佔多數的研究。因此，對
於其他研究而言可說是相當具有新穎性。此外，由於染料敏化太陽能電池具有低成本、製備簡
易等優點，因此發表完後得到現場與會學者相當不錯的反應，並有頻繁的問答。 
 
二、 參與心得 
這是我第三次參與國際研討會，主要專注於太陽能電池材料的應用報告，並利用電化學分
析與交流阻抗分析等方法探討染料敏化太陽能電池之材料特性與界面現象，進一步的探討機制
問題。能夠有機會與全世界不同能源領域的專家相互切磋令我獲益良多，並讓我對於其他新穎
乾淨能源有了更進一步的了解與認識。這次會議已經是國際高分子電解質會議舉辦的第十二次，
已經算是資歷相當豐富的會議，因此吸引到相當多出色的學者與教授到場參加，其重要性可見
一斑。在本次經驗中，能夠在此會議中發表實驗成果，又能與來自世界各國上百名的學者站在
同一舞台上，實屬難能可貴的經歷。特別是能夠現場聆聽染料敏化太陽能電池的發明人 Prof. M. 
Grätzel的演講，其研究的深度與廣度都是我們學習的指標。 
在會議期間，參與了歐洲各國學者的口頭報告，包含了研究生、教授以及公司的開發人員
等，因此出席此次會議讓我大開眼界且增加國際視野，是一種前所未有的感受。在會議中也看
到了許多研究團隊使用許多不同系列的界面活性劑與離子液體來控制其高分子的結構與大小，
這些概念與想法都有潛力能夠應用在本計畫中所要修飾的普魯士藍，藉由界面活性劑控制其普
魯士藍之結構，進而應用在感測器之修飾電極。 
另外由於本身進入實驗室接觸到光電領域的時間不長，而且我的研究是著重在染料敏化太
