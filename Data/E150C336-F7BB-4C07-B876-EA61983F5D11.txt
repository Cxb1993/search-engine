good shielding is used between the probe head in LTCC 
and the semi-rigid coaxial cable. We take the probes 
over a 2000-μm-wide microstrip line as device under 
test (DUT) to measure the probe characteristics. The 
isolation between electric and magnetic fields for a 
reference probe based on old design using the same 
LTCC process is better than 30 dB from 0.05 to 12.65 
GHz. Type A probe has two parallel C-shaped strips, 
it has better isolation of 35 dB from 0.1 to 11.05 
GHz. Type C has one end of its strip shorted to 
ground, its 30 dB isolation frequency range can be 
extended to 0.05~17.8 GHz. With additional layout 
variation in type D, isolation can be improved to 40 
dB up to 10.9 GHz. The spatial resolution defined as 
a 6 dB reduction point for these probes is 140 μm 
when the distance between the metal surface of the 
microstrip line and the nearest edge of the loop is 
held at 120 μm. The calibration factor (CF) of the 
probe, which is defined as the ratio of the received 
magnetic field strength to the probe output voltage, 
is also given.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Complicated electromagnetic interference (EMI) [1]-[2] in high-speed, versatile, and small-sized 
electronic products is often caused from the fast switching operation of large scale integration (LSI) 
circuits. The rapid switching current usually disturbs other victims by coupling to an unpremeditated path 
or straggling along a non-ideal ground loop. These mechanisms will increase the difficulty in directly 
detecting unwanted noise interference. In order to comply with the electromagnetic regulations, pinpoint 
the unwanted emission sources is always the most efficient and low-cost solution during the development 
of a product. Thus, magnetic near-field loop probes [3]-[6] are developed to locate the EMI sources 
because of their capability to provide field mapping information associated with the current density in 
physical circuits. Fig. 1(a) shows a conventional coaxial cable shielded-loop probe with a gap on the 
shielding layer. This gap discontinuity should be located at the middle of the loop, and then the 
common-mode currents (IE) on the external surface of the shield, which are caused from the electric filed 
in the z-axis direction, can be cancelled based on the symmetric structure when the probe is placed 
perpendicular to the xy plane. This kind of probe can be home-made inexpensively but its size is usually 
too large for a chip-level circuit. Magnetic shielded-loop coils [7]-[11] are reformed and manufactured in 
the thin-film, integration circuits, printed circuit board (PCB) processes, etc. A thin-film shielded-loop 
probe comprising an inner conductor and two shielded-ground plates is shown in Fig. 1 (b). Because this 
tri-plates structure is applicable to modern electronic processes, the size of the loop aperture could be 
reduced to less than 100 μm easily, and thus the thin-film magnetic probe can achieve high spatial 
resolution to accurately pinpoint the interference sources. Some probes [12]-[13] are proposed to reduce 
electric filed coupling for high and wideband operation. The basis of these probes is to form a 
common-mode stop-band filter by adjusting the structure of the ground layer. Nevertheless, more electric 
field will directly couple into these probes through the unshielded loop of large area. If the very intense 
electric filed is asymmetric for the probe with good shield, electric field with different magnitude relative 
to the middle gap may introduce asymmetric current distribution on the outside of shield [14]. The 
unwanted common-mode voltage will still be induced from these unequal current coupling into the center 
conductor through the mutual inductance and parasitic capacitance between the center conductor and 
shielded ground. For the same reason electric field coupling will also increase for probes with unshielded 
loop of large region. These kinds of probes are not appropriable for the complicated system, or the 
larger-sized probe with high ratio of loop area to signal metal width is needed to increase the electric and 
magnetic field isolation, but increasing the loop area will result in poor spatial resolution. 
To avoid this problem, by means of stacked C-shaped strips above and below the loop to improve

where c is the velocity of the light in free space. According to (4) and (7), it is indicated that the E-field 
response increases rapidly as the frequency with a slope of +40 dB/decade. Therefore, E-field suppression 
in high frequency operation is always needed for a magnetic probe. A shielded-loop probe similar to  
Fig. 3(a) is treated as another case. In [18] some conditions are assumed as follows. The thickness of the 
shield is larger than the skin depth over all frequencies, all the impedances seen looking into the gap are 
matching, the mutual inductance and capacitance can be ignored while a loop can be modeled as two far 
separately ( seb a , sea  is the external radius of the shield) parallel lines with length identical to the arm 
length between the gap and the neck, and the linear current is distributed along two arms of the loop. 
Common-mode rejection can be evaluated as

where Have is the average magnetic field perpendicularly through the surface of the loop, ICM is the 
common-mode current across the neck, and   denotes the length difference between the two arms of the 
loop. From (8) the E-field can be completely eliminated if the probe is perfectly symmetric ( 0  ) 
regardless of other undesired factors. Although a complex equivalent model may accurately describe the 
probe behavior, the derivative process is difficult and tedious to obtain complete and accurate equivalent 
model when the parasitic elements are significant as the frequency goes up or the structure becomes 
complicated. Based on the guidelines above, we suggest that tuning the probe layout by an EM simulator 
is a much more efficient method in the design of a magnetic probe. 
B. Reference probe structure 
A horizontal magnetic near-field shielded-loop coil manufactured in LTCC had been proposed in [15] 
by us. We further adjust its size to improve the electric and magnetic field isolation, spatial resolution and 
bandwidth of the probe. It will be used as a reference to compare performance of HEFS probes proposed 
in this paper. The 3D view of the probe head is shown in Fig. 3(a). We use a tri-plate stripline-like 
structure consisting of a middle inner conductor and top and bottom ground plates. The loop apertures 
located at metal layer M3 and M5 are closest to the ladle-shaped coil at metal layer M4 to reduce the 
electric field coupling from sides of a probe. A lead section is located between the loop and the following

The line is placed on the XY plane and the middle of metal surface is at Y=Z=0. The distance between 
the metal surface of the microstrip line and the nearest edge of the loop is maintained at about 120 μm. 
Firstly, the horizontal magnetic field probe is placed over the middle of the microstrip line and its loop 
apertures is parallel to the XZ plane, i.e. θ = 0° to receive maximum magnetic field (y component) and 
electric field coupling from the microstrip line. Subsequently, the probe is rotated by 90 degrees about Z 
axis, i.e. θ = 90° to receive minimum magnetic field and electric field. The received signal at θ = 0° are 
mostly from magnetic field (H). At θ = 90°, the magnetic field is at minimum level and the received signal 
is mostly from electric field (E). When received electric field is almost not changed and the probe has 
good ability of E-field suppression, the difference between these received values is defined as the electric 
field suppression ratio (H/E) [8] and used to evaluate the probe’s insensitivity to E-field interference. The 
measurement environment including the tested line and probe is shown in Fig. 4(b). The coaxial cable 
loss has been calibrated by E-cal before executing measurements. 
Fig. 5(a) shows the simulated and measured frequency responses of the probe. We can observe that 
ripples mainly caused from the reflections between coaxial or microstrip line and probe. This can be 
confirmed by comparing the period of ripples and the lengths of tested line and probe. Besides, the 
reflection of common-mode currents along the external surface of the shield may generate standing waves 
for the very small signal from E-field. Thus, severer ripples are in the E lines. For low frequencies, in [22]

proportional to the square of the frequency, caused from the electric field coupling. Although enlarging 
the ratio of the size of loop aperture to the line width is a simple solution to improve the signal-to-noise 
ratio of the probe, larger size of the loop aperture makes the probe have inferior spatial resolution and 
narrower bandwidth due to the LC resonance possibly occurring at lower frequency. Besides, shortening 
the width of signal strip increases the conductor loss and the minimum line width is always limited by the 
process technology. To avoid these problems, we proposed an innovative magnetic probe with excellent 
E-field suppression based on the reference probe. At high frequency, since the parasitic reactance of the 
ladle-shaped strip deteriorates the capability of electric field reduction, intuitively adding the reactance 
opposite to the ladle-shaped strip can recover the symmetric mechanism for E-field noise reduction. 
Therefore, two parallel C-shaped strips are inserted into the loop part of the reference probe. Fig. 6 shows 
the detailed front end of this probe called as type A. The parallel C-shaped strips also provide shielding by 
covering the ladle-shaped strip. The following paragraph will analyze the probe characteristics for 
electric field coupling. 
B. The equivalent models of the reference probe and HEFS probe type A for electric field coupling 
We will focus on the explanation of the probe characteristics concerning the electric field coupling 
when the probe is set at θ = 90° at this section. To simplify the analysis, we assume that the probe ground 
is ideal, i.e. the mutual inductances related to shielded layers are omitted, the probe impedance matches 
50 Ω except for the loop part, and the mutual influence between the probe and DUT can be ignored, hence 
the simplified equivalent model of the probe type A is shown in Fig. 7(a). The meanings of L, ZL, Ve, and 
Vo are identical to the denotations in Fig. 2(b). To make the derivation easier, Ce represents not only the 
self capacitance of the probe but also the coupling capacitor between the probe and tested line. Only Ce 
and L are needed for the equivalent model of the reference probe in terms of E-field coupling, which 
resembles the probe type A without C-shaped strips. The effect of inserted C-shaped strips can be 
modeled as Lc, Ccs, and Ccg. Lc is the self and mutual inductances related to the C-shaped strips. This 
inductor can simultaneously add the mutual inductances at opposite sides relative to the middle gap, and 
the adding currents caused from E field will couple into the probe through these mutual inductances. This 
mechanism will result in an average effect for the E-field coupling from opposite sides related to the 
middle gap and achieve excellent E-field suppression. For high frequencies the E field will not be 
suppressed well because the strong mutual coupling between the C-shaped and ladle-shaped conductors 
becomes predominant. Ccs denotes the parasitic capacitance between the C-shaped strips and the 
ladle-shaped conductor. Ccg denotes the parasitic capacitance between the C-shaped strips and the ground 
plates. Based on this model the frequency response of the probe type A can be obtained as

from the probe and coupling capacitor included in Ce both become smaller. Smaller Ce should lead to 
larger ωn according to (12). The simulation results in Fig. 8(b) meet our expectance where the dotted line 
for largest d has smallest amplitude in the whole frequency range and highest notch frequency. 
C. The measured characteristics of probe type A 
The characteristics of the probe type A are obtained by the same measurement environment as the 
reference probe. Fig. 9(a) shows the measured and simulated frequency responses of this probe when it is 
set at θ = 0° and θ = 90°, respectively. At θ = 90°, we observe that the measured notch frequency is shifted 
about 2 GHz behind the simulated one. We consider that the deviation is caused from the process 
variation in LTCC because several samples have similar results. Fig. 9(b) shows that the measured 
electric field suppression ratio keeps at least 35 dB from 0.1 to 11.05 GHz and has maximum value of 
57.8 dB at 9.05 GHz. The normalized measured magnetic field distribution (y component) of the 
microstrip line obtained from this probe is given in Fig. 9(c). The spatial resolution of the probe type A is 
about 140 μm and identical with that of the reference probe. However, higher spatial resolution for the 
proposed probe with excellent electric field suppression can be achieved undoubtedly by placing the 
probe closer to the tested line. The calibration factor of probe type A is shown in Fig. 9(d). This value is 
slightly larger than that of the reference probe. 
D. Type B, C, and D, three variations of the probe type A 
In this section we introduce three probes with different frequency response for electric field coupling by 
varying the C-shaped strips in the probe type A. Fig. 10 shows that three different C-shaped strips cover 
the same ladle-shaped signal strip. In Fig. 10(a) the length of C-shaped strips is extended from the open 
end with vias to another metal layers. This variation increases the inductance Lc and capacitance Ccg, 
Therefore, the corner frequency, the notch frequency, and stop-band transmission of this probe type B are 
all reduced based on (11)~(13). The frequency responses for the probe type B shown in Fig. 11(a) are 
observed that the resonance drops to around 14 GHz and the measured notch point drops to around 3 GHz 
as compared with the probe type A. Besides, the transmission obtained from this probe is smaller than that 
from the probe type A before 3 GHz at θ = 90°. The measured data with respect to E field do not match the 
simulated values well.  
This is because the measured values are close to the noise floor of the VNA. The notch frequency of the 
probe type A may be shifted toward higher frequency to make the probe have wide stopband by shrinking 
the C-shaped or ladle-shaped strip. However, this method is impracticable because the longitudinal length 
of the loop is already smallest to keep high spatial resolution. Therefore, in Fig. 10(b) we short the open 
ends of the C-shaped strips in the probe type A with vias to move the notch frequency up. This is 
equivalent to shunt a smaller inductor to reduce Lc and Ccg. The frequency responses of this probe named 
as type C are shown in Fig. 11(b). The original notch point in the probe type A is changed from 8 to 
around 15 GHz. It is noticed that the probe type C has quite wideband electric field suppression. The

[23] for a DUT. The available operation frequencies of a magnetic probe can be roughly estimated by its 
output return loss. The measured return loss results of five probes proposed in this paper are shown in  
Fig. 12. We can observe that the probe type B has much deep return loss caused from the LC resonance 
around 14 GHz, this result agrees well with the E and H field responses in Fig. 11(a). 
Finally, some magnetic probes proposed in published papers are used to compare with our probes. 
Because very few single-ended passive probes with high spatial resolution are published, some 
commercial probes are also taken in comparison. These data are summarized in Table I. Since the loop 
sizes of some probes are unknown and others are different from ours, and measurement methods to 
determine the probe characteristics are not provided for some probes, the spatial resolutions of all probes 
can not be compared directly. Nevertheless, best and wideband E-field suppression and operation 
frequencies from our probes can be clearly seen. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
EMI diagnosis using a magnetic near-field probe is standardized in the IEC 61967-6 standard. High 
spatial resolution is most crucial for the non-contact magnetic probe method to accurately locate the 
interference sources. A magnetic probe with high spatial resolution may need three conditions. First is 
small loop aperture but the sensitivity of the probe must be sufficient to detect the emission sources. The 
probe should be very close to the DUT ( 0 / 6 ) but the influence of the probe on the DUT must be small. 
For third condition, the large ratio of loop aperture to signal line width is required to reduce the electric 
field coupling. To keep the smallest loop aperture (400μm×100μm), we insert parallel C-shaped strips 
clamping the ladle-shaped loop to create a high-pass and notch filter for E-field noise in the LTCC 
process. The inclusion of these C-shaped strips improves the E-field suppression ratio and keeps the 
spatial resolution unchanged. Thus the proposed probe and its variations with these common-mode filters

Abstract  —  The inductance of a helical inductor is related to 
the self inductance of each line segment and mutual inductance 
between line segments. As mutual inductance is dependent on 
the distance between coupled metal lines within helical inductors, 
mutual inductance in traditional straight line helical inductors is 
susceptible to layer-to-layer misalignment during fabrication if 
two coupled lines are located at different substrate layers. Two 
types of misalignment tolerant helical inductors (MaTHI) are 
proposed to alleviate the effect of misalignment on mutual 
inductance. Circuit model is also proposed to describe their 
mechanism. Their performance is verified and compared using 
helical inductors based resonator circuits. Simulation and 
measurement results show that two types of proposed MaTHI 
have more stable performance than traditional stacked helical 
inductor under misalignment.  
Index Terms —ʳLTCC, layer-to-layer misalignment, resonator, 
helical inductor. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The latest wireless products demand ever-greater 
functionality, higher performance, and lower cost in smaller 
and lighter formats. This demand has been satisfied to date by 
major advances in integrated circuit (IC) and high-density 
packaging technologies, even though the RF sections have 
continued to demand high-performance and miniaturized 
passive components. The multilayer structure in low 
temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) gives designer lots of 
freedom in designing inductors, capacitors and transmission 
lines with low loss ceramic substrate.  
In the stacking of layers in LTCC process, it is inevitable 
to have some misalignment between layers. Typical 
misalignment is in the range of 20μm~50μm. To achieve 
large inductance, stacked helical inductors are very popular 
structure. As coils are placed at different layers for stacked 
helical inductor within LTCC substrate, layer-to-layer 
misalignment will change the distance between line segments 
at different layers, as well as the mutual inductance between 
coupled wires at different layers. As the inductance of a 
helical inductor is the sum of self inductance from each line 
segment and two times the sum of mutual inductance between 
all pairs of line segments [1], overall inductance will be 
changed when misalignment occurs. 
Misalignment tolerant coupled inductors (MaTCI) that can 
withstand misalignment between layers are proposed by us in 
[2] and [3]. The idea of MaTCI is to split straight line coupled 
inductors (SLCI) into two or more segments and such that the 
segments have opposite direction of change when 
misalignment between layers occurs. We applied the MaTCI 
to the design of misalignment tolerant helical inductor 
(MaTHI) and the circuit model is proposed to quantitatively 
explain why the mutual coupling is more stable for MaTHI. 
Two types of MaTHI are proposed. Simulation results show 
their inductances are more stable than traditional stacked 
helical inductor (TSHI) [4]. 
To validate the performance of two types of MaTHI under 
real LTCC process, parallel L/C resonator circuits are 
implemented using MaTHI and TSHI respectively. 
Measurement results in Sec. III show that two types of 
MaTHI do have better performance as compared to TSHI. 
II. MISALIGNMENT TOLERANT HELICAL INDUCTORS 
Helical inductors are commonly used in LTCC circuit 
design. The characterization and modeling of miniaturized 
LTCC helical inductors is given in [5]. With its multilayer 
structure, helical inductors may also suffer from 
misalignment. We will show the concept from MaTCI that 
can be applied to helical inductors to achieve a more robust 
layout design. 
A helical inductor with two vertically stacked square loops 
and its equivalent circuit model corresponding to physical 
layout are shown in Fig. 1. The scale in z-direction is 
increased to allow a more clear 3D view. The distance 
between two metal layers is usually much smaller than loop 
dimensions. We can consider the circuit model as a simplified 
version from [5]. Each line segment has its own self 
inductance. Mutual inductance occurs between any pair of 
metal lines. To the first order calculation of the overall 
inductance, we only include the effect of mutual inductance 
between closest parallel wire pair. The mutual coupling 
included are between (L1, L5), (L2, L6), (L3, L7) and (L4, L8). 
We will denote these mutual inductance as M1,5, M2,6, M3,7 and 
M4,8.  
The circuit model can be converted into a more readable 
form as shown in Fig. 2(a). And it can be merged into Fig. 2 
(b), where L

The layout of the resonator circuit using proposed type I 
MaTHI and MaTC is given in Fig. 6(a). The measured top 
metal size and dielectric thickness are used in EM simulation. 
Dielectric thickness between top metal and second metal is 60 
μm. The thicknesses are both 45 μm between second metal to 
third metal and third metal to ground. The length of type I 
MaTHI is 1310 μm. The metal line width is 100 μm. The size 
of top metal of MaTC is 1410 μm×1110 μm, while the size of 
second metal is 1310 μm×1010 μm. The layout of resonator 
circuit using proposed type II MaTHI and MaTC is shown in 
Fig. 6(b) and is also fabricated at the same substrate and 
placed next to each other. The length of type II MaTHI is 
adjusted to give same Ls as in the type I MaTCI such that 
resonant frequencies are the same for all resonator circuits. 
The layout of resonator circuit using TSHI and MaTC is 
shown in Fig. 6(c) and is also fabricated at the same substrate 
and placed next to each other. The length of TSHI is also 
adjusted to give same Ls as in the type I MaTCI such that 
resonant frequencies are the same for all resonator circuits. 
Photos of fabricated resonator circuits using proposed type I 
MaTCI, type II MaTHI and TSHI are given in Fig. 7. 
In order to emulate the worst case misalignment, we shift 
top metal at +x and +y directions (i.e. at 45° direction) as well 
as –x and –y directions (i.e. at -45° direction) for 40μm at 
both x and y directions. So, there are nominal, shifted at +45° 
direction and shifted at -45° direction various for each 
resonator circuits in Fig. 6. We will denote them as nominal, 
positive shifted and negative shifted in the following. The 
measured and simulated scattering parameters are shown in 
Fig. 8. We can clearly see in Fig. 8(a) that the resonance 
frequencies of resonators are almost the same at 2.25GHz for 
three layouts that use type I MaTHI. In Fig. 8(b), the 
frequencies of resonators are almost the same at 2.26GHz for 
three layouts that use type II MaTHI. In contrast, the 
resonator frequencies are scattered between 2.24 and 2.3GHz 
from layouts using TSHI in Fig. 8(c).

Table I lists the percentage variations of frequencies of 
resonator circuits using different helical inductors for 
comparison. We can see that two types of MaTHI have about 
one third frequency variation of TSHI under same 
misalignment in measurement. The same layouts are also 
simulated by Agilent ADS Momentum. As there might have 
other process variations in real fabricated circuits, the 
percentage of frequency variations in measurement are not 
the same as in simulation. Even in the presence of other 
process variations such as shrinkage and rotation in real 
LTCC process, type I and II MaTHIs still have better tolerant 
to misalignment than TSHI in measurement.

Abstract —In this paper a compact broadband quadrature 
power splitter (QPS) on LTCC and its design procedure are 
presented. With suitable design of layout and fabricated on 
LTCC (low temperature cofired ceramic), both the high pass 
network and parasitic component are considered for bandwidth 
extension. This will enhance the fractional bandwidth of the 
phase adjusting network as well as the input matching 
bandwidth for QPS. The measured results show a phase error of 
less than +/- 5° and a power imbalance at output port of less 
than 0.6dB from 2.9~7.2GHz. The return loss and isolation is 
better than 10 dB. The size of QPS excluding pad is 
7.1mm×6.2mm. 
Index Terms — LTCC, phase shifter, quadrature power 
splitter (QPS). 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Quadrature power splitter (QPS) is  commonly used in 
balance amplifier [1], image rejection mixer [2] and I/Q 
modulator [3]. It may consist of a power divider and 90° 
phase shifter. The Wilkinson power divider equally splits the 
input power into two output ports and provides good 
isolation between them. The wideband 90° phase shifter was 
first introduced in [4] which gives 90°+/- 5° phase shift in 
80% fractional bandwidth. It provides planar structure to 
implement 90° constant phase difference, but it takes large 
area for 270° reference line at center frequency. The phase 
lead high pass network and phase lag low pass network are 
popular structure for implementing 90° phase shifter since 
they are compact in size and have wide bandwidth. The 
design consideration for high pass / low pass type phase 
shifter was proposed in [5] on RO5880 by SMD components. 
Phase adjusting circuit implemented by metamaterial 
transmission line (MM TL) is another approach. In [6], the 
inductor and capacitor of MM TL are synthesized by SMD 
component and demonstrated 90° wide bandwidth phase 
shifter from 1.1GHz to 3.5GHz. However, SMD inductors or 
capacitors usually only offer limited selection of component 
values. In addition, their parasitic components are not well 
controlled. So their self-resonant frequencies will limit the 
bandwidth of not only phase shifter but also return loss.  
The parasitic component of a MIM capacitor is an inductor 
in series with the host capacitor. For spiral inductor, the 
parasitic component is a shunt capacitor. With good control 
of parasitic components, we can enhance the phase shift 
bandwidth as well as input matching bandwidth.

In [7], the parasite of spiral inductor and MIM capacitor 
are controlled by layout for artificial transmission line by slot 
ground for inductor and aspect ratio of MIM capacitor.  
For microwave monolithic integrated circuit phase shifter, 
high pass and low pass network are often implemented also 
by spiral inductors and MIM capacitors [8].  
In this paper, the high pass network is designed and its the 
parasitic effect is considered to extend the bandwidth not 
only phase but also return loss after resonant frequency. In 
Section II, the design procedure is given. In Section III, the 
quadrature power splitter is implemented on LTCC process. 
In Section IV, measured result for a fabricated quadrature 
power splitter is provided and conclusions are presented in 
Section V. 
II. DESIGN APPROACH 
The topology of quadrature power splitter is shown in 
Fig.1 (a). The phase adjusting circuits are based on high pass 
network and microstrip line. The microstrip line is chosen for 
phase lag network due to its wide bandwidth and easy to 
design the phase delay by tuning length. The phase lead 
network is a high pass type circuit shown in Fig.1 (b). Since 
T-type high pass network only needs one inductor instead of 
two inductors in S-type high pass network, we use it to 
realize phase lead network in LTCC. However the parasitic

bandwidth. The extracted component values of high pass 
network are shown in Table I. EM simulation result shows 
that return loss of high pass network is better than 13dB and 
insertion loss less than 0.6dB from 2GHz to 8GHz. The self 
resonate frequencies of capacitor and inductor are 3.5GHz 
and 4.1GHz respectively. The high pass network can work 
well above these frequencies to 8 GHz. The phase shift at 4.5 
GHz is 42.5° as expected by step two. The length of 
microstrip line at port 3 is then adjusted to give the required 
phase lag at center frequency.

Photo of fabricated QPS is shown in Fig.4. A 100  0402 Ө
SMD resister is soldered for isolation. The measured 
scattering parameters are given at Fig.5. The bandwidth for 
90°+/- 5° phase difference between two outputs port is 85% 
from 2.9GHz to 7.2 GHz and agreed well with EM and lump 
circuit model simulation. The input port and output port 
return losses are better than 10dB from 2 to 8GHz. The 
amplitude imbalance is better than 0.6dB and isolation is 
better than 12dB. The size of QPS excluding pads is 
7.1mm×6.2mm. Table II shows the performance comparison 
with other published QPSs. The size in terms of wavelength 
at center frequency is only 9% of [6], and upper limit of 
operating frequency is two times of [6]. Relative bandwidth 
is better than QPS realized in MMIC.
