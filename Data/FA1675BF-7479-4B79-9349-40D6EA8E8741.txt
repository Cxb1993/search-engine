Abstract
Coordination between the production department and the retail department of a firm
always improves overall business. The imperfect production processes always leads to
imperfect products and decreases the profit of business. The screening process is needed to
inspect products quality. However, screening process influences the inventory holding cost.
Improving the production processes by increasing the investment cost will decrease the
defective percentage of the items. In this study, we develop an EPQ model of deteriorating
items in declining market with investment on imperfect production processes. An algorithm is
developed to derive a production policy such that the expected unit time cost/profit is
optimized. Coordinated policy is provided for comparison. Numerical examples are provided
to illustrate the theory.

1. Introduction
The researches on deteriorating items inventory model are widely done by academia and
practitioners in the past decades (Wee, 1993; Cohen, 1977; Kim and Hong, 1999). Seafood,
battery, volatile chemicals and semiconductor chips are common deteriorating items. These
products will deteriorate with time resulting in decreasing utility or price from the original
one. Most studies assumed perfect items produced. However, the assumption that items
produced and stocked are of perfect quality is unrealistic. Rosenblatt and Lee (1986) were the
early researchers who considered defective items and imperfect quality production processes.
Salameh and Jaber (2000) developed an inventory model considering imperfect items using
3h inventory holding cost per item
* the superscript representing optimal value
TR the total revenue of the retail department per cycle; which is the sum of
total sales of good quality and imperfect quality items
TC the total cost of the production department per cycle
ETC the expected value of TC
TPU the net profit per unit time
ETPU the expected value of TPU
3. Analysis of the model
In this study, the deteriorating items have a constant deterioration rate of , and the
declining demand of D(t) is considered. We assume an imperfect production process by the
production department with a constant production rate of M, the production cost of c per unit
and a setup cost of K per production. Each lot produced contains some percentage of
defectives, p, with uniformly distribution over [α, β(r)] whichβ(r) is a decreasing function as
the investment cost of r. The items are sold by retail department. The selling price of good
quality item is s per unit. The items with imperfect quality assumed a 100% screening of the
production process by the production department at a constant rate. The screening rate is
greater than the demand rate; items of poor quality are kept in stock and sold prior to the next
production as a single batch at a discounted price of v . No shortages are allowed. The
optimum operating inventory strategy is obtained by trading off the total revenues per unit
time, the production cost per unit time, the investment cost per unit time, the inventory
holding cost per unit time and the item screening cost per unit time so that the sum will be an
optimum.
To avoid shortages, it is assumed that the inventory at t1 is positive during production time,
that is
I(t1)-pM t10. (1)
Let I(t) be the inventory level during [0, T]. The differential equation governing the transition

From the production department’s perspective, the minimum of ETCU is the optimum.
However, to consider the total profit, the production department coordinates with the retail
department, and then the maximum of ETPU is the optimum, which is from the firm
perspective.
The domain constraint is considered for feasibility of the model and the solution procedure is
used.
Example 1.
In this example, a=50000, b=40000, M=80000, k=500,θ=0.01, h=5, d=0.5, c=35, s=50, and
v =5. The percentage defective random variable, p, can take any value in the range [α,β(r)]

The EPQ is Q=Mt1= 8920 units, the minimum cost per year ETCU(r, t1)=$1647770 and the
Solution Procedure
Under the constraint of I(t1)-pMt10, higher defective percentage of p would reduce the domain
of ETPU(r, t1) /ETCU(r, t1). The maximal p is considered for the sake of possible solution. For the
concave/convex function of ETPU(r, t1) /ETCU, the optimum occurs either at the interior or at the
boundary of domain (Apostol [9]). Therefore, the solution procedure of optimal (r*, t1*) is
described as follows:
Step 1. Given the maximal defective percentage, named, pm, find the optimal solution of

Step 2. Find the optimal solution of ETPU(r, t1) /ETCU(r, t1) on the boundary of domain
(i.e., I(t1)- )( r M t1 =0, t10.).
Step 3. Stop. The solution is obtained.

[7] considered a multi-product environment where

In this study, we develop an EPQ model of deteriorating
items with investment in imperfect production processes.
The renewal theory is considered in the model. An
algorithm is developed to derive a replenishment policy
such that the expected unit time profit is maximized.

V. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

v =5 and 2 =0.1 are used as the standard values, but 1 is a
variable. When 1 increases, the investment cost, r, and the
production run time per cycle, t1, decrease, but ETPU
increases.
In Table 2 and Fig. 4, the parameters, a=50000,
b=40000, M=80000, k=500, =0.01, h=5, d=0.5, c=35, s=50,
v =5, and 1 =0.01 are used as the standard values, but 1 is
a variable. When 1 increases, r and t1 increase, but ETPU
decreases.
VI. CONCLUSION
This study develops an EPQ deteriorating items model
with investment on improving the production process. An
algorithm is developed to derive a replenishment policy
such that the profit is maximized. The solution procedure of
two steps is developed. Numerical examples are provided to
illustrate the theory. Sensitivity analysis shows that when 1
increases, the investment cost and the production run time
decrease, but ETPU increases. When 2 increases, the
investment cost and the production run time increase, but
ETPU decreases.

Solution Procedure
Under the constraint of I(t1)-pMt1 0, higher defective
percentage of p would reduce the domain of ETPU(r, t1).
The maximal p is considered for the sake of possible
solution. For the concave function of ETPU(r, t1), the
optimum occurs either at the interior or at the boundary of
domain (Apostol [9]). Therefore, the solution procedure of
optimal (r*, t1*) is described as follows:
Step 1. Given the maximal defective percentage, named,

setting 

the domain constraint (i.e.,

then go to Step 3. Otherwise, go to Step 2.
Step 2. Find the optimal solution of ETPU(r,t1) on the
boundary of domain
(i.e., I(t1)- )( r M t1 =0, t10.).
Step 3. Stop. The solution is obtained.
