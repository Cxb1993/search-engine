31. Introduction
Internal waves frequently occur within subsurface layers of the ocean that is
stratified due to either temperature or salinity variations. Either in coastal regions or
deep oceans, they always play an important role in the transport of momentum and
energy within the ocean and therefore have received a great deal of attentions.
According to many observations in several of the world’s marginal seas such as, for 
example, the Andaman Sea (Osborne and Burch, 1980), the theoretical studies are
often carried out under the following two assumptions. First, the whole domain of
the ocean can be simply described by a two-layer system which comprises the
warmer, upper layer extending down to the interface with the colder, lower layer.
Second, since the difference of densities of two layers is very small, it results in a
very minimal displacement of the free surface. Thus the condition of the free surface
can be replaced by a rigid-lid boundary condition.
In past decades, many efforts have been made on modeling the internal wave
equations theoretically. Behaviors of linear internal waves were shown in Lamb’s 
eminent book (1932). He derived the dispersion relationship for either a free-surface
case or a rigid-lid case that is still widely adopted nowadays for describing the
motion of the infinitesimal-amplitude internal waves. As for the development of
theories of nonlinear waves, most of earlier theories were developed under the
condition that internal waves are weakly nonlinear. Among these, Benjamin (1966)
derived the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation which was obtained under the
assumption that the depth of both fluids is short in comparison with a typical
wavelength. Later, the Benjamin-Ono (BO) equation was provided (Benjamin, 1967;
Davis and Acrivos, 1967; Ono, 1975) to treat the case in which the lower layer is
infinitely deep. Since the KdV and the BO equations are on the basis of different
depth ratios, the finite-depth equation that provides a bridge between them was
constructed (Kubota et al., 1978). For taking account into account of higher-order
nonlinearities, the second-order KdV theory was given by Koop and Butler (1981)
and the higher-order BO theory was derived by Matsuno (1994). In addition to
above theories, a perturbation method with respect to the small wave steepness was
adopted by Matsuno (1993). He obtained a unified theory which can reduce to some
of exist theories. Evans and Ford (1996) developed integral equations by the use of
Green theorem and examined some wave properties numerically. Choi and Camassa
established the weakly (1996a) and fully (1996b, 1999) nonlinear wave equations
under the assumption that the waves are long in comparison with the undisturbed
thickness of the upper layer and, no limitation was made on the lower layer.
Recently, the solutions of the third-order Stokes internal waves were derived by
Umeyama (2000, 2002) and were compared with his experimental results. He found

As the values of uz and lz are determined due to (20), it consequently yields the
so-called optimal Boussinesq model. The ratios L under some given
conditions are plotted as the function of i ( 2,1i ) in Figure 2. Some given
conditions of Case (I) and Case (II) are investigated. It shows that the behavior of
dispersion relationship of the optimal model is very accurate in deeper water
configuration. The error is less than 10% during the range of 50  i for almost
all cases.

Second-order random internal and surface waves in a two-fluid system
Chi-Min Liu1
Received 13 December 2005; revised 9 January 2006; accepted 14 February 2006; published 24 March 2006.
[1] Second-order solutions for internal and surface waves
in a two-fluid system are derived using a perturbation
technique. As expected, solutions of the second order are
composed of the products of the first-order components.
Super- and subharmonic transfer functions describing the
relation between the first- and second-order wave
amplitudes are introduced. For the self interaction of the
first-order waves with a fixed wavenumber, there exist
three combinations of linear waves. The associated
superharmonic transfer function and the effects of
second-order waves on wave profiles are examined.
Furthermore, taking the density of the upper layer to be
zero, present results include most existing theories for
second-order surface waves as special cases. Citation: Liu,

1. Introduction
[2] The studies of second-order random waves have
attracted great attention of many researchers over several
decades. Most investigations stressed the wave profile and
properties of surface waves propagating over a single fluid.
Using the wave steepness as a perturbation parameter,
Stokes [1847] gave solutions for analysis of regular waves.
In his study only the sum frequencies (superharmonics) of
first-order waves were considered. The corresponding the-
ory was great helpful to analyze the characteristics of
random regular waves. As for irregular waves, however,
not only sum frequencies appear but also difference fre-
quencies (subharmonics) exist at second order. With the
restriction of slightly different frequencies Longuet-Higgins
and Stewart [1962, 1964] provided solutions for the sub-
harmonic waves. Ottesen-Hansen [1978] overcame the
narrow-band restriction of frequencies and represented the
subharmonic waves in a more adequate form with
the introduction of transfer functions. Transfer functions
are of importance to understand the effects of basic length
scales on the second-order waves. A unified and compact
theory for both superharmonic and subharmonic waves was
provided by Dean and Sharma [1981]. In engineering
applications, theory of second-order waves is often applied
to design the wavemaker signals [Sand and Mansard,
1986].
[3] Since many works are concentrated on surface waves,
however, investigations of internal waves at second order
are comparatively few. Tsuji and Nagata [1973] applied
Stokes theory to study the fifth-order superharmonic inter-
facial waves between two layers of infinite thickness.
Considering a two-fluid system with free surface, Umeyama
[2002] theoretically and experimentally studied the third-
order superharmonic waves. With the assumption of a two-
layer fluid bounded with two rigid plates, a theory including
super- and subharmonic waves at second order was given
by Song [2004]. As the upper boundary is assumed to be
rigid, Song’s results can be applied to practical circum-
stances with slight difference of densities of upper and
lower fluids (for example, the ocean) without great loss of
accuracy. As for the case of large difference of densities,
however, the effects of free surface cannot be ignored
anymore.
[4] In present study, second-order solutions of random
internal and surface waves in a two-fluid system are derived
using the perturbation technique in section 2. Results of
both super- and subharmonic waves at second order are
included. In section 3, the corresponding transfer functions
are defined to analyze the effects of basic length scales on
second-order waves. For the self interaction of the first-
order waves with a fixed wavenumber, the superharmonic
transfer function and internal wave profile are examined.
Conclusions and remarks are made in section 4. Present
study not only greatly improves the understanding of
characteristics of second-order internal waves, but also
includes many existing theories as special cases.
2. Governing Equations and Boundary
Conditions
[5] A two-fluid system with the presence of free surface
is considered. The definition sketch is shown in Figure 1.
The flow in each layer is assumed to be irrotational and
inviscid. The symbols Fm, rm and hm represent the velocity
potential, the density and the undisturbed layer thickness of
the upper (m = 1) and the lower (m = 2) layers. The
displacements of the free surface and the interface are
denoted as hs and hi respectively. The horizontal coordinate
is denoted by x and z means the vertical coordinate starting
at the undisturbed interface and pointing upward. The
governing equations and boundary conditions are as follows

relationship given in equation (26), there exist two solutions
of angular frequencies and it consequently yields two modes
of wave motions, which are usually referred to the fast and

1. Introduction
The problem describing the fluid motivated by an oscillatory plate is usually
referred to as Stokes’second problem [1], which is well-known and important in
fundamental fluid mechanics. Most previous studies gave a steady-state solution
composed of the product of a decaying exponential function and a cosine function,
which is in phase with the plate as ([1]-[2])

Though the above solution satisfies the governing equation and all boundary
conditions, however, it is not a complete solution after all. The so-called complete
solution must include two parts, the steady-state solution and the transient solution.
The transient solution is very important in analyzing the fluid motion at small times
even though it will disappear rapidly as time goes by. Panton [3] presented a
closed-form solution for the complete solution with transient part containing
exponential functions and error functions. Erdogan [4] also applied the Laplace
transform to treat this problem and obtained the results very similar to Panton’s 
solution. Their conclusions indicate that the transient period for the cosine oscillation
of the plate is one–half cycle and is a full cycle for the sine oscillatory case. Even if
their results are exact, the discussion of the shear stress and the velocity distribution
generated by a harmonic oscillating plate of arbitrary initial phase is still lack.
distribution. The transient solutions corresponding to different initial phases are
compared to analyze the intervals of the transient status. The shear stress is analyzed
in Section 3. By differentiating the velocity with respect to the axis perpendicular to
the plate, the stress on the oscillatory boundary can be represented mainly in terms of
sine and cosine Fresnel integrals. The discontinuity at 0t is also well discussed
herein. Conclusion is drawn in the final section.
2. Mathematical Formulation and the Transient Solution
A viscous fluid occupying the upper half-plane with an oscillating plate located on
the x-axis is considered. The y-axis indicates upwards and the fluid is at rest initially.
Hence the diffusion equation is shown as

where  tyu , represents the velocity and  is the kinematic viscosity. Owing to the
condition of no slip at the plate, the fluid velocity adhering to the plate must be equal
to that of the boundary. For the case under consideration, the boundary and initial
conditions are supposed to be

Eq.(9) is the exact solution of Stokes’second problem with arbitrary initial phase not

equation and the boundary conditions are linear, the solution corresponding to any
periodic motion of the boundary can be expressed in Fourier series. Using the

Before discussing the characteristic of the shear stress on the boundary, the basic
properties of Fresnel integrals should be briefly mentioned. The values of zFS and
zCF rapidly increase as z raises from zero and then oscillate with the mean value
about 0.5 as 2z . Finally, the amplitude of oscillations will disappear. It implies
that both the values of sine and cosine integrals will reach 5.0 as z . Hence,
for large times, one can rewrite Eq.(13) as


cosˆ  Tws , (14)
where the subscript s represents the steady-state solution. Eq.(14) can be verified by
differentiating Eq.(10) as well. Now look back on Eq.(13) again, there exists two
terms in the parenthesis. At 0T , the first term causes the wall stress approaching
one cycle passes, the amplitudes of wtˆ decrease gradually in all cases. The transient
time of the wall shear stress is longer than that of the velocity field. The ratio of the
amplitude of the transient shear stress to that of the complete solution will be less than
0.05 as 100T . The influence of different initial phases lies mainly in the slight
inconsistency of both the amplitude and the phase between the complete solution and
the steady-state solution. Finally, the transient shear stress at the plate will approach
zero.
4. Conclusion
In summary the complete solution composed of the steady-state and the transient
solutions are derived for depicting the viscous flow motivated by an oscillatory plate
of arbitrary initial phase. The velocity profile is expressed in terms of complementary
error functions. As the initial phase is closer to zero, the shorter the transient period
exists. There are two terms in expression of the stress, one of which is proportional to
5.0T and the other consists of sine and cosine Fresnel integrals. The wall shear stress
of the cosine case, like its velocity counterpart, approaches the steady state more
rapidly than that of the sine case. The transient state will disappear faster for the wall
stress than that for the velocity field.

THE O(µ6) BOUSSINESQ EQUATIONS WITH THE RECURSION
FORM FOR WAVES PROPAGATING FROM DEEP WATER TO
SHALLOW WATER
Chi-Min Liu*, Chin-Hwa Kong, and Chi-Kuo Lee
ABSTRACT
A study of the Boussinesq equations for waves propagating from deep water to
shallow water is presented.  In this paper, we derive the O(µ6) Boussinesq equations
with the recursion forms not only for main variables but also coefficients.  This greatly
reduces the efforts needed to derive the higher-order Boussinesq equations.  Param-
eters concerning the linear and nonlinear wave properties are also derived to analyze
the accuracy of present models.  The linear properties include the phase velocity, the
group velocity and the particle velocities.  The forcing terms of the continuity equa-
tion and the equation of motion are developed to analyze the nonlinear properties.  By
choosing a suitable water-depth parameter m, the optimal wave models are conse-
quently determined.  Our model provides an easier and more flexible method to ana-
lyze the wave mechanics than previous studies based on the Padé approximation.
Key Words: the Boussinesq equations, the recursion form, the optimal model.

I. INTRODUCTION
The classical Boussinesq equations, first derived
by Boussinesq (1871), are frequently applied to ana-
lyze wave mechanics in shallow water.  The promi-
nent equations are in terms of the depth-averaged
velocity and the free surface elevation for a wave propa-
gating over a flat bottom.  There are two crucial pa-
rameters associated with Boussinesq equations, the
nonlinearity represented by the ratio of wave ampli-
tude to water depth, ε = a0h 0– 1 and the frequency dis-
persion denoted by the product of wave number and
water depth, µ = k0h0.  For most of the applications
of Boussinesq equations, the dispersion parameter is
equal to the square of the nonlinearity parameter.
Another restriction is that both parameters must be
smaller than unity due to the shallow water condition.
After one century passed, Peregrine (1967) im-
proved the classical Boussinesq equations for wave
propagating over an uneven seabed.  This was a key
opening for new researches on old equations.  For
most researchers, numbers of efforts they made are
for the sake of extending the applicable depth range
of Boussinesq equations wider.  Consequently, vari-
ous kinds of optimal wave equations were evaluated
in the following two decades.  Witting (1984) applied
conservative equations to analyze wave mechanics in
a constant-depth channel.  The wave equations were
expressed in terms of the depth-averaged velocity and
the mean free surface velocity respectively.  He ex-
panded the dispersion relation into a Taylor series
form.  Then the corresponding coefficients were de-
termined to yield a Padé approximation to the Taylor
expansion of the dispersion relation given by the lin-
ear Stokes wave theory.  By applying the (2, 2) Padé
approximation, Witting obtained good results for both
deep and shallow water waves.
In 1991, Madsen et al. formulated the conventional
Boussinesq equations for a flat bottom in terms of vol-
ume flux components instead of the depth-averaged

Observing the expressions of Eqs. (7) and (8),
the recursion forms appear not only in the terms Φ i
but in the terms Ψi.  The recursion forms make the
derivation of the high-order equations more efficient.
Consequently, the corresponding variables can be
represented in the recursion forms.  Now we define
Φm which indicates the velocity potential at the el-
evation z = zm, it yields

Insert Eq. (11) into Eq. (4) and Eq. (5), then the

equations, the constant water depth h is considered
in the following analysis.  First, we introduce a new
parameter m to indicate the specific elevation zm
(= mh).  Obviously, the value of m is between –1 (for
the bottom) and zero (for the free surface).  In previ-

Stokes theory in order to decide the optimal wave
models in Section V.  The exact solutions for Eqs.

where the subscripts S denote the Stokes’ results.
IV.  NONLINEAR ANALYSIS
Two series of parameters will be defined and in-
troduced to analyze the nonlinear properties in this
section.  These two nonlinear parameters are obtained
from the equation of continuity and the equation of mo-
tion respectively.  To analyze the Boussinesq equations,
we first introduce the perturbation expansion of the free
surface elevation and the velocity potential as
Φm = Φ0 + εΦ1 + ε
2Φ2 + (26)
η = η0 + εη1 + ε2η2 + ... (27)
By applying Eqs. (26) and (27) into Eq. (5), we
order the equation by powers of ε.  At each order
O(εn), it yields (setting h = 1)
∂ηn
∂t + L1Φn = –∇ ⋅ Fn (28)

L1 = (G1∇ 2 + µ2G2∇ 2∇ 2 + µ4G3∇ 2∇ 2∇ 2

In order to obtain the optimal Boussinesq
equations, both the linear and the nonlinear param-
eters will be considered in next section to make the
closest approach to those of the Stokes theory by
choosing a suitable water-depth parameter m.
V.  THE OPTIMAL BOUSSINESQ
EQUATIONS
The different kinds of Boussinesq-type equations
can be formulated by choosing the water-depth parameter
m.  In shallow water with the condition 0 < µ < 1, all
kinds of equations provide an excellent prediction of
all properties for wave propagation.  However, as waves
travel in medium or deep water, the choice of m will
strongly dominate both the behaviors of nonlinear and
linear characteristics of waves.  Namely, though each
linear or nonlinear characteristic has its own optimal
value of m, we still need to determine the optimal m to
balance all behaviors.  Many studies based on the Padé
approximation face the dilemma that the most excel-
lent behavior of dispersion relation always leads to
poor predictions of other properties, for example, the
particle velocities.  In this section, we will provide a
new way to balance and overcome such a problem.  In
general cases, all nonlinear and linear properties should
be considered in an equivalent status.  Hence the value
of m will be generated by taking the arithmetic mean
of the optimal m of all properties.  However, it should
be remarked that the other assessment, e.g. the weighted
mean, can be also used for studies which focus on some
specific wave characteristics.  Fig. 1 shows the rela-
tion between the optimal value of m and µ.  The opti-
mal value of m will approach a certain value as µ gets
large enough.  To examine and compare the optimal
models, we choose the range of µ from 0 to 20.  The
corresponding optimal values of m are –0.346,
–0.581 –0.611 for the O(µ2), O(µ4) and O(µ6) models
respectively.  From now on, these three values will be
adopted to examine all available properties of waves.
Observing the phase velocities shown in Fig. 2, the
O(µ2) model represents a poor behavior that the curve

C. M. Liu et al.: The O(µ6) Boussinesq Equations for Waves Propagation 761
–0.8 respectively.  The O(µ6) model gives the best ap-
proximation to the exact solution.  It also shows that
the curves diverge faster in the lower elevation water
than in the upper one.  Comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 2,
the accuracy of the phase velocity is more precise than
that of the particle velocities as µ grows.  This result,
which was also mentioned by Gobbi et al. (2000), shows
that the natural characteristics of phase velocities and
particle velocities are intrinsically different.  The pa-
rameter of particle motions owns higher powers of co-
efficients so that it is harder to approach the exact
solution.
As for the nonlinear properties, two parameters
nonlinear parameters, Ei and Fi, which concern the equa-
tion of motion and the equation of continuity are slightly
different from the transfer coefficients which appeared
in Gobbi et al. (2000) and Madsen et al. (2002).  The
transfer coefficients are obtained by introducing the
Stokes-like expansion of wave amplitude and the concept
of bound waves.  Here we directly analyze the forcing
terms of two nonlinear equations, Eq. (28) and Eq. (31),
without making any assumption of wave types.  Figs.
5 and 6 display the phenomenon of the forcing terms
(E1, E2, F1, F2).  The O(µ6) model still shows a better
behavior than the other models.
Finally, we should emphasize again that the op-
timal values of m used in this section are obtained by
taking the arithmetic mean of the optimal m of all
linear and nonlinear properties.  In other words, if
the respective optimal value of m of each wave prop-
erty is adopted, the behavior will be much better than
that using the present figures.  Additionally, in some
figures we find that the accuracy of the O(µ4) model
will surpass the O(µ6) model when µ is large enough.
It is a natural phenomenon because of the highly di-
vergent behavior of the higher-order model.  In what
range of µ the accuracy of the lower-order model will
exceed that of the high-order model is another inter-
esting topic in the future.  The details will be left to
our next study.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, the O(µ6) Boussinesq equa-
tions are derived in terms of the velocity potential at
an arbitrary elevation.  A recursion form is adopted

Abstract: Progressive surface waves in open channels with trapezoid cross sections are 
studied analytically in our present paper. Two analytical methods for solving this problem are 
provided. The frequencies of longitudinal modes of progressive surface waves are also given. 
The convergence of the eigenvalues obtained by different methods is well compared and 
discussed. 
 
Key words: progressive waves, eigenvalues, open channels 
 
 
1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Although the subject of gravity waves is an old one in civil engineering, nowadays solutions 
for progressive surface waves in open channels of variable depth are important to 
hydrographers and engineers concerned with wave motion in rivers. The number of explicit 
analytical solutions for wave motion in open channels of variable depth is extremely small. 
The solutions for the frequencies of water in open channels with certain triangular sections 
presented in Lamb’s work remain to this day the only exact linear solutions in existence for 
surface waves. 
   
In all the cases of surface waves under investigation, the governing mathematical system 
represents an eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalue is the wave frequency, and the 
eigenfunction is either the velocity potential or the stream function, or else some other 
function which is an unknown function of the mathematical system. It is the purpose of this 
paper to determine the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions for the cases under study here. The 
methods of solution and the results will be presented in the following sections. 
   
In this paper, gravity waves propagate along the longitudinal axis will be studied. The wave 
length is also along the longitudinal axis of the channel. Thus we shall call the wave motion a 
longitudinal mode. The progressive surface waves in a channel may also be under the 
influence of transverse oscillation, in a to-and-fro fashion. If so, the longitudinal waves should 
include this motion. 
   
The purpose of this paper is to study the frequencies for various modes of waves propagating 
along the longitudinal axis of trapezoid channels with various depths by two different

Consider a channel of trapezoid cross section, and set the unit width and the depth of the 
channel to be unity and  respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. The following two analytical 
solutions for longitudinal modes in a trapezoid channel are introduced. Two methods for 
solving the eigenvalues of gravity waves propagating in trapezoid channels are provided 
herein. First, the Bessel-function method is applied to solve the problem. Consider the 
cylindrical coordinate system, the Laplace equation can be written as

We also can solve the eigenvalues of Eqs.(21) and (23) by inserting them into two boundary 
conditions Eqs.(19) and (20). 
 
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
To solve the eigenvalues, the beginning N terms of Eqs.(14), (16) (21) and (23) can be 
arbitrarily selected. Hence the corresponding  eigenvalues can be solved by inserting 
these  terms into boundary conditions Eqs.(19) and (20). Table 1 shows the results of 
Bessel- function solutions. The case of sloping angle  is discussed herein. It is logically 
reasonable that the more terms we taking, the more accurate eigenvalues we’ll obtain. In other 
words, the eigenvalues will converge to a specific value if N is large enough. Table 2 
represents the results of hyperbolic-function solutions. It is also needed to emphasized that the 
solution consisted of hyperbolic functions is only applicable to the case of the sloping angle 
 of trapezoid channels. Fig.2 represents the relation between eigenvalues and k for 
H=0.25 and H=0.5. Each eigenvalue will approach to a specific value as k approaches zero. 
Comparing the convergence of these two solutions on the angle , Fig.3 shows the 
convergence of different eigenvalues for the case

adoption of hyperbolic functions causes the faster convergence happening almost for each 
eigenvalue. Besides, it also shows in each case that the eigenvalue will converge to a specific 
value while . 5≥N

Weakly Nonlinear Model Equations for Internal Waves 
Chi-Min Liu 1  
ABSTRACT 
  A new model for describing internal wave propagation in a two-fluid system is constructed in this study. The 
method of derivation is analogous to that of deriving the enhanced Boussinesq equations in a single-layer fluid. This 
problem has two classifications, i.e. the thicker upper-layer and lower-layer cases. After matching the dispersion 
relationship of present model to that of exact linear solutions, the optimal model equations are consequently 
determined. Present model is expected to have wide applications to treating not only wave propagations in coastal 
regions, but in detection of submarines in deep oceans.

1. Introduction 
Internal waves frequently occur within subsurface 
layers of the ocean that is stratified due to either 
temperature or salinity variations. Either in coastal 
regions or deep oceans, they always play an important 
role in the transport of momentum and energy within 
the ocean and therefore have received a great deal of 
attentions. According to many observations in several 
of the world’s marginal seas such as, for example, the 
Andaman Sea (Osborne and Burch, 1980), the 1 
theoretical studies are often carried out under the 
following two assumptions. First, the whole domain of 
the ocean can be simply described by a two-layer 
system which comprises the warmer, upper layer 
extending down to the interface with the colder, lower 
layer. Second, since the difference of densities of two 
layers is very small, it results in a very minimal 
displacement of the free surface. Thus the condition of 
the free surface can be replaced by a rigid-lid

boundary condition. 
  In past decades, many efforts have been made on 
modeling the internal wave equations theoretically. 
Behaviors of linear internal waves were shown in 
Lamb’s eminent book (1932). He derived the 
dispersion relationship for either a free-surface case or 
a rigid-lid case that is still widely adopted nowadays 
for describing the motion of the 
infinitesimal-amplitude internal waves. As for the 
development of theories of nonlinear waves, most of 
earlier theories were developed under the condition 
that internal waves are weakly nonlinear. Among these, 
Benjamin (1966) derived the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) 
equation which was obtained under the assumption 
that the depth of both fluids is short in comparison 
with a typical wavelength. Later, the Benjamin-Ono 
(BO) equation was provided (Benjamin, 1967; Davis 
and Acrivos, 1967; Ono, 1975) to treat the case in 
which the lower layer is infinitely deep. Since the KdV 
and the BO equations are on the basis of different 
depth ratios, the finite-depth equation that provides a 
bridge between them was constructed (Kubota et al., 
1978). For taking account into account of higher-order 
???????????????????????????????March 18-19, 2006? 
potentials of the upper and lower layers on the specific 
elevations uzz =  ( )10 ≤≤ uz  and lzz =  ( )01 ≤≤− lzδ  respectively, to replace 1Φ  and 2Φ .

where 202 hk=µ , 202 ha=ε , 212 hh=δ .It is 
remarked that the valid ranges of uz  and lz  for 
Case (II) are within 20 δ≤≤ uz  and 01 ≤≤− lz . 
Certainly, the choice of uz  and lz  significantly 
dominates not only the velocity potentials uΦ and 
lΦ  but also the resulting wave properties. This choice 
also makes present Boussinesq equations more 
flexible to simulate internal waves under different sea 
circumstances. Besides, by dropping higher-order 
nonlinear terms, one can reduce present fully 
nonlinear Boussinesq equations to the weakly 
nonlinear equations which can be further reduced to 
the KdV equation.. 
3. Determination of the Optimal 
Model Equations 
 Since our derivation is based on the assumption ( ) 12 <iO µ , all possible values of uz  and lz  will 
make present equations excellent in shallow water 
configuration. If one hope to extend the applicable 
range of present equations to larger thicknesses of 
fluids, it requires to choose uz  and lz  to make the 
linear dispersion relationship of present model 
identical to that of the exact solution, which is 
expressed in the form of the (2,2) Padé approximation. 
Assuming both velocity potentials uΦ  and lΦ  are 
proportional to ( )[ ]txi ω−exp  and eliminating 2η  
from the linear-type Boussinesq equations gives the 
linear dispersion relationship

The exact solutions of F  and yF , which is valid 
for large times and small times, can be applied to 
many problems. For example, Eq.(2) can be converted 
to the momentum equation by setting b  and a  to 
be the dynamic viscosity and the porous velocity on 
the boundary. Hence, Eq.(1) can be rewritten as

The positive and negative wV  indicate the mass 
blowing and suction on the boundary, respectively. 
Treating the above momentum equation with the 
conditions of Eqs.(2) and (3) leads this problem to be 
the Stokes’ second problem with arbitrary initial phase. 
Eqs.(5) and (6) provided the exact solutions of he 
velocity distribution and the stress on the boundary 
respectively. The results [2] show the transient state of 
the wall stress will disappear faster than that of the 
velocity field and the cosine oscillation ( 0=θ ) 
reaches to the steady state more rapidly than the sine 
oscillation ( 2πθ = ).  
  Similar to the discussion of the momentum equation, 
the energy equation with the flow condition 
0=∂∂ yu  can be obtained by setting b  and a  to 
be the thermal diffusivity and the porous velocity on 
the boundary and is shown as

For the heat transfer problem, Eqs.(6) and (7) give 
the temperature profile along the y axis and the heat 
flux at the plate which is defined as the Nusselt 
number. Detailed discussions are left to next section.
