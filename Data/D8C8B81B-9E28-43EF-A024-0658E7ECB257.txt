2reversible palette based image steganography
method. We also develop a reversible palette
based steganography technique with capacity
optimization. (2) Apply the developed
techniques to the practical usage of digital media
trading. For example, buyers can preview the
images of the grayscale form before paying, and
the different level of color information will be
extracted from the grayscale image depend on
money he has spent. It means that the more the
buyer pays the richer the image will be.
We have proposed reversible palette image
steganography methods with high capacity and
these methods can also be applied in the
application of color image protection.

二、計畫緣由與目的
調色盤影像格式常見於網際網路的應用
上，著名的PNG、GIF以及微軟BMP圖檔等
格式，均為受廣泛支援的網際網路標準之調
色盤影像格式，此外，它們支援高階無失真
壓縮，支援多重影像檔案及動畫檔案等特性
都大大提昇它們的實用性而使調色盤影像在
網際網路的應用上佔有一席之地。
無失真資料隱藏技術，或稱為可回復式
(reversible)資料隱藏技術，近年來成為令人關
注的新興領域，原因是失真的資料隱藏技
術，會因嵌入所隱藏的秘密資料後，致使原
始媒體失真（distortion），而無法回復原始媒
體，甚至在抽取所隱藏的資料後，原始媒體
會發生永久性的失真。而在一些專業領域的
應用裡，數位媒體資料需要藏入相關資料，
但在資料取出後，必須完全還原回原始媒體
品質，不得有任何的失真，例如在醫學影像
(如X光片、核磁共振影像等)、軍事用途上，
用於診斷或情資研判等或是執法人員的搜證
資料方面等。因此，針對這些專業領域的需
求，設計適合的無失真資料隱藏技術有其必
要性。
針對藏入的對象媒體(cover media)類型來區
分無失真資料隱藏方法，可以大致分為(1)
原始資料、未經壓縮及空間域的資料形式
(Raw data) (2)轉換、量化及頻率域的資料形
式(lossy compressed data)(3) 無失真的資料壓
縮形式(Lossless compressed data)三類，最近
幾年來在無失真影像資料的應用上，越來越
受到重視，因為常見的影像如卡通、地圖、
電子圖鑑等其顏色數目有限，所以常以調色
盤影像的方式儲存，因為可以藏入的空間較
其他類型媒體有限，故挑戰性也較高，調色
盤影像所具備的特性如下：(1)具備顏色色
盤，利用索引值來代表像素顏色(2)顏色數目
如4、16、64、256色等，數目不大(3)利用無
失真壓縮方式如LZW方法來進行壓縮(4)常見
PNG、GIF及微軟BMP圖檔格式皆為調色盤
影像(5)當色盤顏色RGB三元素值設為相等
時，即可代表一般256灰階影像。Bao等人
[1]，利用無失真調色盤影像資料隱藏技術於
醫學電子圖鑑的保護，藉由改變水平掃描線
所經過顏色區域之像素奇偶點數，來藏入驗
證資料。如圖一所示，(a)為原始電子圖鑑，
(c)為藏入資料後的影像，(b)為兩張圖差異的
地方，合法使用者可以將圖(c)完全還原回圖
(a)。
圖一、無失真調色盤影像資料隱藏技術於醫
學電子圖鑑的保護(資料來源[1])
Liu等人[2]則提出高容量調色盤影像資
料隱藏新方法，利用調色盤不同索引值可以
指向相同顏色的方式來藏入資料，Chaumont
等人[3]提出利用調色盤影像技術於彩色影像
的保護機制，將影像的存取分成兩種等級，
一般使用者在網路上只能下載灰階影像，只
有付費合格的使用者可以在下載灰階影像
後，將之還原回彩色影像，此應用在網路交
4色調色盤影像為例，先將色盤依出現次數排
序 ， 若 各 種 顏 色 出 現 的 頻 率 分 別 為
5000,3000,1000,1000,0,…,0(如圖三(a)所示)，
總共有12個空色盤顏色，利用此法，若將索
引值0的顏色copy給其他7個空色盤索引，湊
成2的指數次方個索引值，如此這些次盤索引
都指向同一顏色，可藏入3×5000位元，剩下5
個空色盤顏色，依序分給索引1,2,3各3,1,1個
空色盤顏色，也就是將12個空色盤分成四群
(4個索引顏色有值)，記為S=(7,3,1,1)，此時
可藏入資料量為3×5000＋2×3000＋1×1000＋
1×1000＝23000位元，很明顯的這種分群方式
超過一組解，比如S=(3,3,3,3)，此時可藏入資
料量為2×5000＋2×3000＋2×1000＋2×1000＝
20000位元，在此情形下，由高頻率索引依序
以可湊成最大的2的指數次方的方式，得到較
佳的隱藏量，但這卻不適用於任何情形，如
圖三(b)所示，若各種顏色出現的頻率分別為
2600,2500,2500,2400,0,…,0，由高頻率索引依
序以可湊成最大的2的指數次方的方式，可求
得S=(7,3,1,1)，此時可藏入資料量為3×2600＋
2×2500＋1×2500＋1×2400＝18000位元；而
另一組解S=(3,3,3,3)，可藏入資料量為2×2600
＋2×2500＋2×2500＋2×2400＝20000位元。
因此Liu所提出的方法，未必會的到最佳解。
圖三(a)、非0顏色出現次數較不平均的色盤
圖三(b)、非0顏色出現次數較平均的色盤
圖三、無失真調色盤影像資料隱藏容量分析
在本研究中，我們將利用窮舉法(Exhaustive
Attack method)，假設一張調色盤影像(具有
256色)，其中共有M個未使用的色盤entries。
首先我們先將色盤顏色依照影像中出現的頻
率予以遞減排序，利用下列的演算程式可以
將所有可能的配對，全部列印出來，解的總
個數為cnt種，虛擬碼如表一所示。只要針對
所有解計算可藏的容量後，就可以求得最佳
解。學者Shannon所提出的消息理論中，資訊
量的定義稱之為熵（entropy），如公式：



q
i i
i P
P
1
2
1
log
(1)
當資訊量愈小，符號出現的機率分佈愈是懸
殊，反之當資訊量愈大則會愈平均，因此，
我們可以知道符號出現的機率是會影響整體
的資訊量。在圖十三的例子中，圖三(a)的熵
值為 1.685，而圖三(b)的熵值則為 1.997。也
就是說圖三(a)相對應的影像，比圖三(b)相對
應的影像，資訊量較少，可以壓縮的空間較
大。
四、所提出研究方法與實驗結果
4.1 提出之具有高容量的無失真資料隱
藏方法
上述演算法[9]適用於調色盤影像之
資料隱藏，可以得到高容量之隱藏量及
令人滿意的嵌入後影像品質，但終究會
對寄主影像(host image)造成不可回復的
破壞。為了達成可回復資料隱藏的目
的，我們進行的作法如下：
在影像中以疊代的方式，為使資料隱藏量
最大及額外資訊愈小，每次疊代都找出影像
中出現頻率最高的顏色，以及出現頻率最低
的顏色，為達到嵌入資料的目的，犧牲出現
頻率最低的顏色，將色盤裡的位置空出來，
與出現頻率最高的顏色形成一組配對，將來
一個若代表藏0，另一個就代表藏1。並且為
了能保持影像的視覺品質與回復原始影像，
出現頻率最低的顏色必須轉嫁予其最接近的
顏色，同時亦將犧牲的顏色像素座標加以儲
存，當作所需的額外資訊（以位元字串的格
6－資料嵌入演算法的流程與步驟
圖五、資料嵌入演算法之流程
輸入：一張調色盤顏色大小為 L（0～L-1）的調
色盤影像 f、秘密訊息 M，以及設定影像品
質的門檻值 ε，且 S =φ。
輸出：偽裝的調色盤影像 g。
Step 1: 計算影像 f裡顏色出現頻率 N(i)。
Step 2: 在出現頻率 N(i)裡，找出最高出現頻
率 N(a)及最低出現頻率 N(b)，且
S-1-L,{0,ba,  。
Step 3: 計算移動 b 顏色的額外資訊 O，及 b
與其最接近的顏色 c 之間的距離 d(b,
c)，但 c 不能包含在 S 裡。
Step 4: 假如 N(a)大於 O(b)且 d(b, c)<ε，則跳
到 Step 5，反之則跳到 Step 8。
Step 5: 記錄 b 顏色的額外資訊 O(b)，用 a 的
調色盤顏色取代 b 的調色盤顏色，以
及複製修改的調色盤給影像 g。
Step 6: 在沒有失真的情況下；假定 a<b，連
續掃描 f 影像裡的資料，會有二種情
況需要處理，即一旦遇到像素的索引
值為 b，便將變更後的像素索引值給
c；若是像素的索引值為 a，則檢查並
嵌入的位元資料（包含額外資訊及秘
密訊息），其中假設欲嵌入位元是 1
的話，則將變更後的像素索引值給
b，假設欲嵌入位元是 0 的話，則保留
像素索引值 a。
Step 7: 將這些修改後的資料複製給影像 g，
並且將 a 及 b 加入集合 S ，接
著，跳至 Step2。
Step 8: 停止動作及輸出調色盤影像 g。
以下以一張512×512的Lena調色盤影
像，其中色盤0到15個顏色及相應的索引值之
出現次數（如圖六），說明資料嵌入的流程。
而圖例中，粉紅色數字字體代表出現機率最
高、最低與最接近的顏色之出現次數，而
A、B及C則是用來表示出現機率最高、最低
與最接近的顏色及索引值。
依據上述定義，從色盤裡找尋出現機率
最高者與最低者，因此圖六中，A為一次疊
代中出現機率最高者，B為一次疊代中出現
機率最低者，而C則為與B之顏色距離最近
者。
圖六、Lena 調色盤影像與其索引值 0 至 15
的出現次數
圖七、將顏色 B 的像素值轉嫁給顏色 C
從色盤裡找到出現機率最高者A與最低
者B後，先針對顏色B找出顏色最相近的顏色
C，並且將顏色為B的像素改為顏色C，以空
出色盤裡顏色B的位置來進行資料嵌入動
作，所以，從圖七可看出，直方圖裡顏色B
8第一次疊代中，對隱藏資料的嵌入，原始影
像必須先針對顏色B1的像素位置以顏色C1取
代（如圖十一(a)）。從圖十一 (b)可清楚看
出，以顏色C1取代後，影像中顏色B1的位置
會變成顏色C1，但是像素值一經變動後，為
了到時能回復原始影像，我們會記錄被犧牲
的B1像素座標位置，當作所必須支出的代
價。對於第一次疊代，我們必須記錄的額外
資訊實際上需要63 bits的長度，這對一般大
小為256×256以上的影像而言是微不足道的，
不過為了能清楚地說明本方法，我們採用大
小為6×6的影像來說明，但此額外資訊對6×6
影像而言是過大的負荷，因此為了清楚說明
所 提 的 方 法 ， 我 們 假 設 額 外 資 訊 為
「1101001011011000」的位元資料，以利說
明。
圖十二、6×6影像中第一次疊代的額外資訊
在嵌入資料之前，演算法會先複製A1的
顏色給B1，使得A1與B1為同一種顏色。接下
來，當要嵌入資料時，A1與B1會遵從演算法
的嵌入規則來進行資料隱藏的動作，即倘若
嵌入位元為0，則不變動索引值A1，若嵌入位
元為1，則變更索引值為B1。而且，從額外資
訊（即1101001011011000）裡我們發現到，0
與1呈現均勻地分佈，所以A1的出現次數將會
平均分配到A1與B1之中。為清楚明白看出嵌
入後的變化，在圖十一(d)中，A1與B1以藍色
數字字體來標記，而紫色數字字體標記嵌入
的位元資料，最後可得到第一次疊代且資料
嵌入後大小為6×6的偽裝影像（如圖十一
(d)）。而第二次疊代裡，由於沒有最接近B2
的C2，因此做完第一次疊代後則結束資料嵌
入程序。
－資料抽取演算法的流程與步驟
圖十三、資料抽取演算法之流程
輸入：一張調色盤顏色大小為 L（0～L-1）
的偽裝調色盤影像 g。
輸出：原始的調色調影像 f 及秘密訊息 M。
Step 1: 計算影像 g 裡面的顏色出現頻率
N(i)。
Step 2: 分別找出相同調色盤顏色的配對。每
一配對依據 Step2-1 及 Step2-2 抽取出
隱藏的訊息。
Step2-1: 在沒有失真的情況下，假定
配對(a, b)且 a<b，連續掃描
g 影像裡的資料，一旦遇到
像素的索引值為 a，便輸出
位元 0，若是遇到像素的索
引值為 b，便輸出位元 1，而
這些抽取出來的資料位元用
一個集合 D 收集起來。
Step2-2: 集合 D 包含兩個主要的部
分，額外資訊及隱藏的秘密
訊息。從額外資訊中抽取出
疊代數目 j，並且分別表示額
外資訊 Oj及秘密訊息 Mj。
Step 3: 隨著疊代數目依序增加，將收集的秘
密訊息 Mj放入 M 中。
Step 4: 隨著疊代數目依序減少，利用額外資
訊 Oj，修改相對應的影像資料及影像
g 的調色盤顏色。輸出調色盤影像 f
及秘密訊息 M。
資料抽取的過程，主要的關鍵是找出具
有相同顏色的索引值配對，再依據所隱藏的

4.2 所提出之多層次影像保護機制
近幾年來，一種網路影像販售方式逐漸興
起－某些網站提供樣品低品質影像免費下
載，但是若使用者要求原始高品質影像，則
需另外付費購買，傳統方式實現這種需求，
是在資料庫中分別儲存不同品質的數位影像
以因應不同需求。Chaumont等人[3]首先提出
利用資料隱藏技術將不同等級的影像藏入另
一等級的影像中，來實現不同需求之影像下
載的機制，其作法是將影像區分成兩種品質
等級，針對任一張彩色影像先經過色彩量化
成K色後，利用調色盤索引以luminance為鍵
值再排序後，設為高等級影像；再將此K色
影像轉換成為K階灰階影像，然後將之前色
盤影像的色盤資訊加密後藏入此灰階影像
中，將此偽裝灰階影像設為低等級影像。低
等級的影像提供免費下載，如果使用者想要
取得其高等級影像，需要取得加密的鑰匙，
先將藏在灰階影像中的色盤資訊抽出，用加
密鑰匙解碼還原調色盤資訊後，再將灰階影
像回復為彩色影像。其流程如下圖所示：
圖十五、Chaumont等人提出之彩色影像保護
機制之資料隱藏流程
Chaumont等人的方法在傳送端可以分為
三個步驟：首先將原始彩色影像利用量化技
術，降階成為K色的彩色影像，再利用調色
盤重新排序方法，將彩色影像以亮度值
luminance為鍵值重新索引，之後再將索引值
直接轉換為灰階值，就可以獲得相對應的灰
階影像，最後以LSB方法將彩色影像色盤資
訊藏入這張灰階影像中，由於此灰階影像所
對應之索引值已經過排序，而且藏入的資料
量並不大，所以利用LSB方式藏入資料並不
致於造成太劇烈變化。至於接收端，在下載
此低等級影像之後，必須先將藏入的色盤資
訊抽取出來並解碼還原調色盤資訊，然後將
灰階影像像素的灰階值轉換為相對索引的色
盤顏色，如此雖然會有部份像素失真(因為資
料隱藏造成失真 )，整體的效果仍可達到
PSNR值(與原始K色影像相比) 30dB以上。
Chaumont等人的方法雖然成功達成不同需
求之影像下載的機制，但是由其實驗結果顯
示此方法仍舊存在一些缺點：(1)所回復的彩
色影像品質仍不夠好，(2) 利用調色盤重新
排序方法，將彩色影像以亮度值luminance為
鍵值重新索引，之後再將索引值直接轉換為
灰階值，所得到的灰階影像品質並不好(3)經
過資料隱藏後的灰階影像(marked image)，
常有雜訊出現。本研究利用所提出之無失真
高容量調色盤資料隱藏的方式來取代
Chaumont等人所使用的資料隱藏方法，除了
可以將資料隱藏後的灰階影像品質提昇之
外，並可以將彩色影像無失真的回復。所提
方法如下圖所示：

Abstract. This study proposes a novel reversible data-hiding method
based on an iterative approach for palette-based images. In each itera-
tion, the number of occurrences of palette color in the image is computed
in order to identify the most and least frequently occurring colors in a
palette for data hiding. Data are hidden by sacrificing the least frequent
color and placing the most frequent color in its position in the palette to
make a pair. After the most frequent color takes over the palette index of
the least frequent color, two palette indices stand for the most frequent
color. Therefore, one bit can be hidden in every pixel where the most
frequent color occurs in the image. To make the host image reversible,
the overhead information caused by sacrificing the least frequent color
must be saved for image reconstruction. The performance of the pro-
posed method is demonstrated on test images by showing the capacity
and distortion. Several successful similar efforts have also been imple-
mented for comparison. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
method has a high embedding capacity and good marked-image
quality. © 2008 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

1 Introduction
Reversible data hiding DH schemes have recently drawn
considerable attention from many scholars.1–3 In contrast to
conventional DH methods, the embedding process of re-
versible DH schemes should be invertible, so that it can
completely restore the original cover media after extracting
the embedded secret data. Reversible DH is important for
those who are very concerned about the quality of images
after information has been embedded, such as for medical
images or images adopted as evidence in court. Existing
reversible approaches can be roughly classified into three
categories, based on the image format to which the embed-
ding process is applied: 1 lossy or transformed format; 2
lossless compressed format, and 3 raw data, uncom-
pressed format.
In the first category, reversible DH is applied to the lossy
compressed domain. Fridrich et al.1 adopted a reversible
function to adjust the quantization table and embed one bit
into each discrete cosine transform coefficient of a JPEG
image. Yang et al.2 presented a reversible watermarking
technique that utilizes modified vector quantization, and
Chang et al.3,4 proposed a reversible DH scheme based on
side match vector quantization SMVQ for digitally com-
pressed images.
In the second category, the reversible DH is performed
during the lossless compression process. Xuan et al.5 em-
ployed histogram modification to embed secret data into the
middle frequency of wavelet coefficients. Shim et al.6 pro-
posed a DH Lempel-Ziv-Welch LZW method that alters
the original LZW method without losing its generality, and
embeds data in source data in a lossless manner. Since the
data compressed by DH LZW can be decompressed using a
general LZW decoder, this method can be easily adopted by
many applications like GIF, TIFF, and PDF. However, be-
cause lossless compressed data have little redundancy, they
have little room for data hiding.
Liu et al.7 proposed a high-capacity reversible DH
method for palette images using duplicate palette colors.
The palette image is made up of the color palette and the
bitmap pixel array. Their experiments have shown that
many 8-bit palette images do not use all of the 256 palette
entries. They copy the RGB value C of a used palette entry
A to an unused entry B. The bitmap pixel array of the host
image can be scanned when the information is embedded to
find the pixel p with index value A. If a data bit 0 is em-
bedded at p, then the index value of p remains A. If a data
bit 1 is embedded at p, then the index value of p is updated
as B. This method works because indices A and B point to
the same color. The embedded message is obtained after
extraction, because A and B point to color C when the test
image is scanned. This embedding algorithm does not alter
the image quality at all, so no further reconstruction is
needed. This method successfully embeds data in every oc-
currence of the most frequent color without distorting the
host image, but can only work on images with blank palette

The RGB values can be transformed to CIE XYZ via a
33 matrix transformation with D65 white point15. Let
the range for valid R, G, B values be 0,1. Then the trans-
formation matrix is given as follows:
X = 0.412453 · R + 0.357580 · G + 0.180423 · B ,
Y = 0.212671 · R + 0.715160 · G + 0.072169 · B ,
Z = 0.019334 · R + 0.119193 · G + 0.950227 · B . 2

Definition 3. The overhead O of removing the i’th entry
of a palette is defined as the number of data bits that need
to be saved for lossless reconstruction:
O = log2 L2  +  + log2 L +  + log2 W + log2 HNi .
4
In Eq. 4, log2L /2 gives the number of bits needed to
be stored for representing the iteration number in the pro-
posed scheme. For instance, given 256 different palette col-
ors, 7 bits are stipulated to record the iteration number,
because one pair of colors is selected out in an iteration.
The parameter  indicates the number of bits to represent
the value of Ni, the number of occurrences of color entry
i in the image. One needs log2 L bits to record the re-
moved entry id i, and  is the number of bits required to
describe the RGB values of a palette color. Finally, log2 W
and log2 H are the numbers of bits required to represent
the X and Y coordinates of pixels with color entry i in the
image, respectively. Notably, if Ni=0, then only
log2L /2++ log2 L bits of overhead are needed to per-
form the reconstruction, because the entry color and coor-
dinates are both null.
Definition 4. The data-embedding capacity for copying
the color of an entry j to a removed entry i is given as the
occurrence frequency of entry j in the palette image:
C = Nj 5
In this way, the actual data-embedding capacity pure ca-
pacity AC can be expressed as
AC = C − O . 6
Assume that color entries a and b represent the least and
most frequently occurring color in the image, respectively.
Before executing the data-embedding process, all the pixels
with color a are altered to a’s closest color c, so as to empty
the entry a in the palette. The related information about the
pixels with color entry a must be recorded as overhead O.
Color b thus has two occurrences in the palette. Denote the
indices of those two occurrences by a and b. Without loss
of generality, assume that ab; thus a is associated with 0,
and b is associated with 1. A total of Nb capacity bits can
be embedded in the image, where Nb is the number of
occurrences of color b in the image.
2.2 The Data-Embedding and -Extracting
Algorithms
In the embedding process, the overhead information O and
the secret data are concatenated and embedded into the im-
age. The image can be scanned by rows. If a pixel with
color b is encountered, then its pointer to the palette is
adjusted to a to embed a 0, or left as b to embed a 1.
The message extraction proceeds by scanning the image
in the same manner again and extracting the concatenated
bit stream from all pixels with pointers to colors a and b.
The overhead information is then extracted and decoded to
yield the related information to reconstruct the original im-
age. The process for restoring a marked image to the origi-
nal image involves two steps: changing all the pixels with
color entry a into b, then recovering those pixels that have
been changed to color entry c into a, based on the decoded
information. The details of the embedding and extraction
algorithms are described as follows.

In summary, the flow charts shown in Figs. 2 and 3
respectively illustrate the proposed reversible data-
embedding and -extraction algorithms. The computational
load of the proposed algorithm is light, since it does not
need to apply any transformation such as the discrete co-
sine, discrete wavelet, or fast Fourier transformation. All
processing is in the spatial domain. The required processing
mainly lies in the computation of the occurrence frequency
and the closest color for each palette entry, and in the pro-
cess of scanning pixels in the image.
Each iteration of the DH algorithm takes OL time to
calculate Ni and the closest color to color i in the palette;
OMN to scan the image data of size MN and com-
pute the overhead of entry b. This algorithm stops after at
most half of the L iterations, because it adds two color
entries into S in step 7, and these are not selected as can-
didates in step 2. Therefore, this algorithm requires total
OL2+LMN time. The total embedding time required
for the “Lena” image 5125128 is just 90 ms when
performing the proposed method on a personal computer
with Intel Core 2, 2.13 GHz, and the C++ Builder 6.0 soft-
ware.

to embed data into the image. Lin et al. [7] presented a multilevel reversible data hiding method based on histo-
gram modification of difference images. Yang et al. [8] presented a reversible watermarking technique that util-
izes modified vector quantization, and Chang et al. [9]proposed a reversible data hiding scheme based on side 
match vector quantization (SMVQ) for digitally compressed images. 
 In the second category, the reversible data hiding method is performed in frequency domain. Fridrich et al. 
[10] adopted a reversible function to adjust the quantization table and embed one bit into each discrete cosine 
transform coefficient of a JPEG image. Xuan, et al. [11] used histogram modification to embed secrete data into 
the middle frequency of wavelet coefficients and make this method suitable for the JPEG 2000 images.  
Recently, Chaumont et al. [12] proposed a new concept to access different level of images on the Internet by 
using a LSB-like data hiding technique. However, there are still some drawbacks of their method. The main 
disadvantage of their method is the low quality of reconstructed palette images. In this work, we propose a re-
versible data hiding method for palette images to generate better quality marked images and reconstruct the 
palette color images without any distortion. Our method can efficiently improve the method of Chaumont et al. 
This paper is structured as follows. The related work is illustrated in section 2. The proposed reversible data 
hiding method for palette images is illustrated in section 3, and the experimental results as well as the discus-
sions are shown in section 4. Conclusions are drawn in section 5.

2.1 Chaumont et al.’s Method 
Chaumont et al. [11] proposed a concept to access different level of images on the Internet by using a LSB-like 
data hiding technique. The objective of the method proposed by Chaumont is to allow free access to the grey-
level image and give color image access only if the user owns a secret key. Their method is performed using 
three major steps; they are fast color quantization, optimized ordering and adaptive data hiding. The principle is 
to build an indexed image which is also a semantically intelligible grey-level image. In order to obtain this par-
ticular indexed image, which should be robust for data hiding, a layer running algorithm is proceeded to sort the 
K colors of the palette. Finally, a LSB-like data hiding scheme is used to embed the palette color information in 
the grayscale image. The procedure of this method is illustrated in Figure 1. 
 
 
 
Fig. 1. The data hiding and extracting procedure of Chaumont et al.’s method 
 
Chaumont et al.’s method embeds palette information of a palette image into its corresponding grayscale im-
age in the data hiding process, and the palette information is extracted to perform the image reconstruction in the 
extracting process.  Since the palette information is encrypted with a secret key before the embedding operation,

as follows. In the data embedding process, the palette colors of the palette image are sorted according to their 
occurrence frequencies.  Then we create a grayscale image with a palette information transformation which 
denoted as follows:               ⎣ ⎦iiiiii bgrbgr 114.0587.0299.0''' ++===                                                                (1) 
Note that the RGB components are set in the same values for each palette entry i, therefore, the display of the 
palette image is a “grayscale” image. The quality of the generated grayscale image is much better than the index 
images using Chaumont et al’s method. Finally, a reversible data hiding scheme is performed to embed the 
original color palette and overhead information into the gray palette image. The main concept of the proposed 
reversible data hiding scheme for palette images is described as follows: 
Let us assume that color entries a and b denote the least and most frequently occurring color in the image, 
respectively. Before performing the data embedding process, all the pixels with color a will be changed to a’s 
closest color c to “empty” the entry a in the palette. The number and coordinates of those pixels with color entry 
a need to be recorded and are denoted as overhead O. This way, the color b will have two occurrences in the 
palette. Let us denote the indices of those two occurrences by a and b. Without loss of generality, assume that 
a<b, then we associate a ‘0’ with a and a ‘1’ with b. There are totally N(b) capacity bits can be embedded in the 
image, where N(b) is the number of occurrences of color b in the image.  
In the embedding process, we concatenate the overhead information O and the palette information and em-
bed them into the image. We can scan the image by rows and whenever we encounter a pixel with color b, we 
change the pointer to the palette to a if we need to embed a “0” or remain the pixel to b if we need to embed a 
“1”. The message extraction proceeds by scanning the image in the same manner again and extracting the con-
catenated bit-stream from all pixels with pointers to color a and b. We then extract the overhead information and 
decode it to obtain the related information for reconstructing the original image. The process for recovering a 
marked image into the original image includes two steps, the first one is to changed all the pixels with color 
entry a into b, and the second one is to recovery those pixels which have been changed to color entry c into a 
using the decoded information. The details of the embedding and extraction algorithms are described as follows. 
Algorithm: Proposed Data Hiding Algorithm 
Input:  a palette image f  and set S=φ; Output: a marked grayscale palette image g’  
Step1:   Let N(i) be the occurrence frequency of index i in image f,  sorted the palette entries according to N(i) 
in decreasing order. Change the index value of every pixel in f to its new index value which pointers to 
the same color according to the sorted palette. A new image f’ with a sorted palette is generated and the 
appearances of the palette images f and f’ are the same. 
Step2: Convert the palette image f’ to a grayscale palette image g using the following luminance transform 
equation. Every palette color PCi=(ri,gi,bi) in the palette of  f’ will be replaced with ),,( '''' iiii bgrPC =  
where ⎣ ⎦iiiiii bgrbgr 114.0587.0299.0''' ++=== .         
Step3:  The sorted color palette information {(ri,gi,bi);0<=i<=255} is encrypted and denoted as the embedded 
message M using the DES encryption system with a secret key K.  
Step4:   Derive the occurrence frequency N(i) for image f, where Si∉ .Suppose that the color of palette entry 
with the least occurrence frequency is a and the color of entry a is defined as PCa={ra,ga,ba}, and the 
color of palette entry with the most occurrence frequency is b and the color of entry b is defined as 
PCb={rb,gb,bb}. Replace all the pixels with index a to index c where the color difference between PCa 
and PCc ( Sc∉ ) is minimal. Since the occurrence frequency of b is N(b), the corresponding data em-
bedding capacity is also N(b).  
Step5:  In the case that the PCc happens to be PCb, the embedding capacity N(b) will set to be N(b)+N(a). Since 
the original locations and palette color of a have been recorded as the overhead information, the recon-
struction can be completely done.     
Step6:    The overhead O of removing the ath entry of a palette is denoted as 
                      N(a)+ ( ⎡ ⎤W2log + ⎡ ⎤H2log )×N(a)                                                                                                  (2) 
   where N(a) indicates the number of occurrences of color entry a in the image and  ( ⎡ ⎤W2log + ⎡ ⎤H2log )
×N(a) represents the numbers of bits required to represent the X and Y coordinates of pixels with color 
entry a in the image of size W × H. If N(b)-O(a)>0, then go to Step 7; else go to Step 9. 
Step7:   Sequentially scan the image data of g(i,j); once a pixel whose index value is a which is the entry with 
the least frequency, change its pixel index to c. After that, make the new color of PCa={rb,gb,bb} by 
copying the palette color of PCb to PCa and record the overhead O of removing the entry a from the 
palette. Then, concatenate the overhead information O and the secret data M as a bit stream. 
Step 8:  Without a loss of generality, assume that a<b. Sequentially scan the image data of f(i,j). Once meet the 
pixel whose index value is b, check the bit stream that is to be embedded (including the overhead in-
formation and the hidden message). If the embedded bit is ‘0’, the pixel index is changed to a. If the 
embedded bit is ‘1’, the pixel index remains as b.

cases.  Especially, it seems to be no distortion between the marked and the luminance images.  The marked 
image of images Airplane and House are lossless to their luminance images. This is because these two palette

A reversible data hiding scheme based on palette color replacement is proposed to embed the color information

3algorithms are that they do not suffer from salt-and-pepper artifacts and offer a high 
capacity. However, they are not robust like algorithms of first category.
   Palette-based image file formats such as GIF, PNG and Microsoft BMP are 
popular and widely used on the Internet web sites. However, steganographers tend not 
to like to use palette-based images, because the limitation on the colors available in a 
finite palette causes difficulties in hiding data. There are only few articles addressing 
to the reversible data hiding techniques for palette-based image. Some existed 
reversible data hiding techniques for palette-based images are belonging to the second 
category. Liu et al. [6] proposed a high capacity reversible data hiding method for 
palette images using duplicate palette color. Palette image is made up of the color 
palette and the bit map pixel array. Their experiments have shown that many 8-bits 
palette images do not use all of the 256 palette entries. They copy the RGB value C of 
one used palette entry A to the unused one B. When the information is embedded, one 
can scan the bit map pixel array of the host image and find the pixel p with index 
value A. If a data bit “0” is embedded on p, then the index value of p is remained as A. 
If a data bit “1” is embedded on p, then the index value of p is updated as B. This 
scheme works because indices A, B point to the same color. In extraction, the 
embedded message is obtained depending on the pointers A, B to color C when the 
5image to embed data. In their methods, the zeros(unused colors) can be used in 
different ways to map hidden data as “1” and “0” combinations according to the 
number of bits used in the mapping process. If the number of zeros =  and of the 
most frequent colors are repeated in these zeros locations, as each color has been 
repeated twice to map either “1” or “0” from the hidden message. Suppose the 
histogram is sorted in decreasing order according to the occurrence frequency in an 
image and denoted as N[i], the embedding capacity will be equal to the summation of 
the first α terms in the N[i] as given in (1):

For example, if the number of zeros =10 are divided into 10 sets with one entry in 
each set. Then 10 peaks (the most frequent colors) are separately used to combine into 
10 clusters. Therefore, there are two entries in each cluster and can be used to embed 
1-bit of data in the data hiding process. This way has a limited embedding capacity for 
images. To increase the capacity, different sizes of clusters are considered to embed 
variable bits of data to achieve capacity optimization. The optimization scheme 
proposed by Saleh’s [7] is discussed as follows. 
For the value of unused zeros  compute the maximum n-mapping bit n0 where 
12 0n . Create a decreasing order sequence S={Sn0, Sn0 -1,…,S1} where Si=2i -1 
and denoted as n-mapping sequence, Let T be a decreasing sequence T={ t0, t1 ,…,tβ-1}

of the sorted palette:

Where the first element in each cluster Ci is belonging to the most frequent colors and 
the other elements in Ci are all belonging to the least frequent colors. For example, if 
= 10 and T={ t0, t1, t2, t3 }={7,1,1,1} is one solution, the 4-sets of code books are 
C0={0,249,…,255},C1={1,248},C2={2,247}and C3={3,246}. In the data embedding 
process, pixel data in the image is scanned. If an entry in cluster Ci is met , iC2log
bits of data can be embedded by selecting any entry in to replace the original one, 
where iC  is the number of entry in Ci. The encoding of data bits for each entry is 
simply designed in an increasing order to represent the value from 0 to iC -1 in 
binary form.  For this example = 10, if an entry in the first set is met, it means we 
can embed 3 bits of data. If an entry in the second, third or fourth set is met it means 
we can embed only 1 bit of data. The designed 4-set code books are shown in Figure 
1.
93.2 The proposed data embedding/extracting algorithm
In the data embedding process, suppose the palette is ordered decreasingly using 
occurrence frequency and there are least frequency entries(LFE) should be 
removed, the pixels pointer to these entries will be changed to other entries not in the 
LFE with their closest color in the palette. To make the host image reversible, the 
overhead information caused by sacrificing the least frequent colors must be saved for 
image reconstruction and passed as a part of the embedded payload during embedding.
Then the spared positions will be filled with the values of the most frequency 
entries(MFE) for the purpose of data embedding. The corresponding data 
embedding and extracting algorithms are shown as follows:
Algorithm: The Proposed Data Embedding Algorithm
Input:  a palette image f with a set of palette entries which are sorted in decreasing 
order according to the occurrence frequency, the sorted occurrence frequency 
N(i), the hidden data with size of , 
Output: a marked image g’
Step1:  Compute the overhead  of removing the least frequency entries in the 
palette.  
11
Algorithm: The Proposed Data Extraction Algorithm 
Input:  a marked gary-level image g
Output: the palette image f and the hidden message M
Step 1:  Create its occurrence frequency N(i) for image g. 
Step2:  Identify the β-sets of palette entries by searching the same palette color from 
the palette colors in an increasing entry-index number. Build the β-set code 
books. Sequentially scan the image data of g. If a pixel whose index value
equals to one entry in the code book, extract and decode the embedded data 
bits according to the code book. Accumulate the extracted data bits as a data 
set D.
Step 3: Repeat Step 2 until all of the embedded data is extracted. Divide the set D into
the overhead information O, the representing value of and the hidden 
message M. 
Step 4: Reconstruct the original palette image using the extracted overhead 
information O and output the hidden message M.
In summary, the flowcharts shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively 
illustrate the proposed reversible data embedding and extraction algorithms. The 
computational load of the proposed algorithm is light, since it does not need to apply 
any transform such as DCT, DWT or FFT. All processing is in the spatial domain.

These results in Table 2 show that the proposed scheme can obtain both the high 
embedding capacity and PSNR values. The proposed method is able to embed about
60–200Kb pure data into the three test palette images of size 512×512×8 while 
maintaining the PSNR of the marked image versus the quantized image above 58dB. 
  To evaluate the proposed method, different reversible data hiding approaches were 
compared. The generally used images “Lena” and “Baboon” with 512×512×8 gray 
levels were adopted as test images. We saved these grayscale images as Microsoft 
BMP file format and performed the proposed method for comparison. Table 3 shows 
the overall comparison between Celic et al.’s method [2], Ni et al.’s method [8] and 
the proposed technique in terms of pure payload and PSNR. These comparisons 
reveal that the proposed technique has achieved the best PSNR values with a quite 
large data embedding capacity.

Keywords: Halftone image, Inverse halftoning, Reversible data hiding, Look-up table (LUT), Gaussian filtering. 
Abstract: A new inverse halftoning algorithm based on reversible data hiding techniques for halfton images is 
proposed in this research. The proposed scheme has the advantages of two commonly used methods, the 
look-up table (LUT) and Gaussian filtering methods. We embed a part of important LUT templates into a 
halfton image and restore the image lossless after these templates been extracted. Then a hybrid method is 
performed to reconstruct a gray-scale image from the halfton image. In the image reconstruction process, 
the halfton image is scanned pixel by pixel. If the scanned pattern surrounding a pixel appeared in the LUT 
templates, a gray value is directly predicted using the LUT value, otherwise, it is predicted using Gaussian 
filtering. Experimental results show that the reconstructed gray-scale images using the proposed scheme 
own better quality than both the LUT and Gaussian filtering methods. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Inverse halftoning is a process which transforms 
halftone images into gray-scale images. Halftone 
images are binary images that provide a rendition of 
gray-scale images and consists of ‘0” and ‘1”. It has 
been widely used in the publishing applications, 
such as newspapers, e-documents, magazines, etc. In 
halftoning process, it need to use a kernel to carry 
out the conversion, and the common kernel is such 
as Floyd-Steinberg kernel, and is difficult to recover 
a continuous-tone image through halftone 
manipulation, conversion, compression, etc. In the 
past few years, many efficient inverse halftoning 
algorithms have been proposed, but there is no way 
to construct a perfect gray image from the given 
halftone image. There exist several inverse 
halftoning methods, including kernel estimation 
(Wong, 1995), wavelet (Xiong, Orchard, & 
Ramchandran, 1996), filtering (Fan, 1992; Kite, 
Venkata, Evans, & Bovik, 2000), and set theoretic 
approaches (Chang, Yu, & Lee, 2001). Most of these 
methods can obtain good reconstruction image 
quality but require relatively high computational 
complexity. 
The halftoning and inverse halftoning processes can 
be regarded as the encoding and decoding processes 
of vector quantization. Therefore, the codebook 
design methods can be applied to build the inverse 
halftoning lookup tables (Mese & Vaidyanathan, 
2001, Chung & Wu, 2005). The content of a table 
entry is the centroid of the input samples that are 
mapped to this entry. The results are optimal in the 
sense of minimizing the MSE for a given halftone 
method. Although the table lookup method has the 
advantages of good reconstructed quality and fast 
speed, it faces the empty cell problem in which no or 
very few training samples are mapped to a specific 
halftone pattern.  
In this paper, a reversible data hiding scheme for 
halftone images is proposed. We embed a part of 
important LUT templates into a halfton image and 
restore the image lossless after these templates been 
extracted.  Then a hybrid method is performed to 
reconstruct a gray-scale image from the halfton 
image.  
86
 on the halfton image with the same content of A will 
be selected to embed 1-bit data. If a data bit “0” is 
embedded on p, then the content of p is remained as 
A. If a data bit “1” is embedded on p, then the 
content of p is updated as the content of pattern B. 
This scheme works because pattern A, B look 
similar. In data extraction process, the embedded 
message is obtained depending on the pattern A, B 
when the test image is scanned. To achieve a higher 
capacity of embedding data, more pattern pairs 
should be determined, whose steps can be presented 
as below. 
1. Partition the original image into non-overlapping  
3 × 3 blocks. 
2. Compute the occurrence frequencies for all 
appeared patterns. Sort these used patterns 
decreasingly and denoted them as iPH  according 
to their occurrence frequencies.  
3.  Find out all unused patterns. Assume that there 
are totally k unused patterns, k pairs of patterns 
( iPH , iPL ) should be constructed to perform the 
data embedding.    
 4.  Search all blocks in the original image. As long 
as we come across a pattern in the iPH  , if a bit 
“0” is embedded, the block is remained as iPH ; 
Otherwise the block is updated as the pattern iPL . 
Figure 3 displays the top 10 patterns iPH  and 10 unused 
patterns iPL  from Lena image.  
 
Figure 3: An example of iPH  (first row) and iPL (2nd row) 
obtained from the Lena image. 
However, the image quality of stego-image 
generated using the proposed method is not very 
well in the visual effect.  Figure 4(a) shows the 
stego-image obtained using the proposed method 
with 26317 bits embedded into Lena. 
To consider human visual effect, we should take 
notice about some situations which will cause 
“Congregation” effect of bright or dark spots.  These 
cases are displayed bellows.  To avoid these cases 
when a pattern replacement occurs, we adjust the 
weights of distance on pattern similarity  
computation and a better result is obtained. Figure 
4(b) shows a good image quality for the stego-image.

method; (a) without quality consideration (b) with quality

3.2 Determine Important LUT 
Templates to be Embedded 
The proposed method is a kind of hybrid inverse 
halftoning method which has the advantages of 
Gaussian filtering and LUT methods. Figure 6 
shows the reconstruction process for these two 
methods.  For an image block in the halfton image, 
if the difference of predicted value and the original 
real gray value using Gaussian filtering method is 
larger than the difference using LUT method, then 
the LUT template is worth to be recorded and 
embedded. This means the LUT template can obtain 
a higher image quality than using Gaussian filtering 
method in the image recovery process.  However, 
only a part of important templates which save larger 
quality loss are selected to embed since the 
embedding capacity is limit for a halftone image.  In

LUT template.

Abstract— In this study, an article recommendation 
system for English reading comprehension improvement is 
proposed. The goal of this study is to find out the most important 
attributes that affect the difficulty of an article according to the 
levels granted by the General English Proficiency Test (GEPT). 
Using the determined attributes to classify the articles gathered 
by the crawler from the Internet everyday and recommending 
the proper ones to the user, the proposed system is designed to 
keep the users from being recommended the articles those are too 
hard or too simple and retain their learning enthusiasm.   
To determine the attributes that affect the difficulty of an 
article, the classification algorithms of decision tree are used to 
construct the classification rules. The experimental result shows 
that to classify article into the 3 levels defined as elementary, 
intermediate, and high-intermediate according to GEPT, require 
5 attributes to achieve above 70% above accuracy; while to 
classify articles into just elementary and high-intermediate level, 
only 2 attributes are required for 80% above accuracy.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
In 1999, the Ministry of Education of Taiwan, as part of its 
promotion to encourage the general study of English of life-
long learning, lent support to the LTTC (language training and 
testing center) in its development of the LTTC GEPT (General 
English Proficiency Test). The aim of the test is to provide a 
fair, valid, and reliable gauge for each level of comprehension 
in English. The LTTC GEPT is used by various government 
institutions, private enterprises as well as hundreds of public 
and private schools as an admissions, placement, or graduation 
criterion. About 2.20 million people have taken the test since 
its inception in the year 2000[1].  
 
The Internet is absolutely a fast growing media. It grows 
faster than any other media that ever occurred in human history. 
According to the study of ITU, Internet only use 4 years to 
achieve 50 million of users, which take 13 years for TV to meet 
the same number. As it grows so fast, for a user who tries to 
improve his English comprehension via Internet, the good news 
is he can have numerous articles everyday for free, while the 
bad news is dealing with the tremendous amount of 
Information, finding suitable articles for learning on Internet 
has become a dirty job.  
 
This paper proposes a framework of an article 
recommendation system which makes use of the classification 
method in data mining techniques to recommend proper 
articles according to users’ English comprehension which is 
annotated in user profiles. This framework can be divided into 
2 portions, the classification model constructing portion and 
the article recommending portion. In the first part, to make the 
recommending results fit the difficulty classification principles 
of GEPT, we collects 60 articles from each of the GEPT 
reading tests of elementary, intermediate, and high 
intermediate levels respectively as the training samples to 
construct the classification rules. After the rules are 
constructed, they are applied to the recommending subsystem. 
To make use of the bountiful resource of reading articles on 
the   Internet, the second portion of this study collects articles 
from the Internet daily by the crawler programs. After the web 
pages of articles are collected, a sequence of text operations 
are applied on them including the tag-removing, stop words 
removing, and stemming. Then, the attributes required by the 
classification rules will be determined for each article. Finally 
the classification rules will be applied for recommendation.   
 
The presented paper is organized as follow, the related 
works are presented in section 2, the architecture and algorithm 
of proposed system are presented in section 3. Implementation 
and experimental results are shown in section 4. Finally, 
conclusion are discussed in section 5.  
II. RELATED WORKS 
A. Web page Recommendation System 
A user often can not obtain appropriate information using 
search engine. The research about web page recommendation is 
to help user search information that really reflects users’ 
intention. Sano et al  use bookmarks of a user[2], Kamei et al 
recommend web pages among some users[3], Hasegawa select 
a path of the web retrieval[4]. These researches perform web 
retrieval taking into account users preferences.

the occurrence of the 2001th~5000th frequently used 
wordsand W stands for the number of words in an article 
2)  Decision tree construction 
   C5.0 decision tree algorithm is adopted in this portion to 
construct the decision tree. Articles collected from the GEPT 
reading test are used as training data, so that the decision model 
trained can classify other articles collected from the Internet 
according to the difficulty ranking level of GEPT.  
 To find out the most important attributes that affect the 
difficulty of an article. We applied the C5.0 algorithm 
iteratively with training data to abbreviate the number of 
attributes which are described above. Each time an attribute is 
deleted, the decision tree is reconstructed and evaluated by the 
accuracy of classification.   The purpose of this step is to 
construct a neat decision tree which has good classification 
ability. After the decision tree is well constructed, the decision 
rules can be generated and applied to the recommendation 
system.  
C. The article collecting and recommendation subsystem 
a) The web crawler 
To make use of the bountiful resource of the Internet, the 
article collecting subsystem collects articles daily using a 
crawler program.  
Web crawlers start by parsing a specified web page, noting 
any hypertext links on that page that point to other web pages. 
They then parse those pages for new links, and so on, 
recursively. The web crawler gets web pages by simply sends 
HTTP requests for documents to other machines on the Internet.  
b) Text operation 
The documents collected from Internet by web crawlers are 
called the corpus. Before they can be classified, a sequent of 
text operations are applied to them. Tags removing, stop words 
removing and stemming are included. Fig 2 shows an example 
of text operations.

The accuracy for each classification level varies distinctly, 
as we can see in table 2, the accuracy for elementary, 
intermediate, and high intermediate are 73%, 61%, and 79%, 
respectively. It implies that the behavior of the intermediate 
level that reflects the attributes chosen is quite inconsistent to 
the other two levels. For this reason, we perform another 
experiment that constructs decision tree and classifies articles 
to only elementary and high-intermediate levels. The attributes 
abbreviation and classification accuracy are shown in Table 3 
and Figure 7. As we can see in Table 3, only 2 attributes are 
required to achieve the accuracy of 80% above in classifying 
articles into 2 levels. Decision tree constructed by using the 
most important attributes is shown in Figure 8, and the 
classification rules for this decision tree are shown in Figure 9.

一、參加會議經過  
 
  本次出國主要的目的是去參加SIGMAP 2009 報告論文  - A Reversible Data 
Hiding Scheme to Inverse Halftoning，並藉由報告論文的空檔，觀摩國際間在訊號處
理以及多媒體應用領域上的發展趨勢、方法、以及目前的現況。  
  SIGMAP 2009是 Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and 
Communication(INSTICC)協會聯合舉辦的國際電子商務與通訊研討會，是在義大利
米蘭舉行，共有四個重要的研討會議：ICE-2009、WINSYS 2009、SIGMAP 2009及
SECRYPT 2009，其領域涵蓋了多媒體、資訊安全、電腦電信網路、電子商務等等，
有來自不同國家超過兩百篇的投稿，顯示有相當多的研究者投入這次的研討會。 本
次的會議為期總共四天，許多的Keynote speech以及 Panel Discussion，讓世界各國
的學者都可以參與主題的討論，做學術上的交流。針對五場keynote比較有興趣的是
由 University of Milan ， Pierangela Samarati 教 授 主 講 的 ”PROTECTING 
INFORMATION PRIVACY IN THE ELECTRONIC SOCIETY”，探討電子社會的情
境下，資料安全與保護所面臨的挑戰與困難。 
  本人參加報告的Session屬於訊號處理以及多媒體應用，是在第二天上午的九點半
開始，順位是第一個，有許多此一領域的學者參與，也與本人做簡短的討論交流。 這
篇論文主要是發展一套以二元半色調影像為對象，進行無失真資料隱藏，經由LUT

一、參加會議經過  
中國國際電腦科學及教育研討會自2006年至今已經是第四屆，之前先後在厦
門、武漢、開封等地召開過三届。此會議已有眾多来自資訊科學、教育和控制
领域的國際知名專家、IEEE院士蒞臨在大會上做精彩演講，這次報告題目是利
用決策樹之文章閱讀推薦系統，我們嘗試利用英文文章中，內容所抽離出來的
特徵，來決定文章的難易程度，再用以作為分類以及推薦的準則。 
這次研討會的地點在中國廣西首府南寧市，參與會議的人數為歷屆之最，超
過一千人，論文發表的相當踴躍，本次的會議為期總共四天，我在會議的前一
天就抵達會場南寧飯店並check in，第一天有個開幕儀式，請到南寧市長致詞，
接著有兩場keynote，其中由University of Melbourne，工程學院院長  Iven 
Mareels，所談 The Melbourne Model – Engineering，如何教導工程學生，融入
藝術的範疇，並提增美學的概念，是未來相當重要的教育工作。尤其是現今資
訊科技一日千里，但是在追逐科技的同時，若沒有相關的藝術人文素養，很難
有創新的設計。 
這是我第一次參加在大陸舉辦的國際會議，發現大陸學者十分的認真，全程
少有離席，而且十分專注，本人參加報告的Session屬於資訊科技於教育上的應
用，是在第二天上午的十點半開始。每個作者的報告只有15分鐘，在我用英文
報告完後，多位學者提出相關問題來討論，十分熱烈。另外大陸學者對台灣來
