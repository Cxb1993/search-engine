2marketing advertisements. A trade-off exists in the economic growth and environment protection.
This also tells us that the future of smart phones continue to the popularity of the internet topology from
a fixed location expanding to everywhere in the world and the importance of network continue to grow.
Because value-added services must be transferred through wired or wireless ways to pass the
information to end users, as long as the network had reached the place, people can browse online
information such as Facebook using mobile devices. And now the most popular virtualization
technologies are also strongly dependent on the network to meet the following critical requirements:
VMotion [8] and Fault Tolerance.
The important network device, router, calculates its own routing table which satisfies specified QoS
requirements in the table entries to efficiently deliver packets to the desired destination address. The
network activities are expected to grow in the future and these devices must be placed in the server
room of extreme cooling air. Companies have a special cold place to store those routers and server
equipments in order to prevent network disconnection or suspension of services caused by high
temperature.
Router has a special component, Content Addressable Memory (CAM), to perform quick table lookup
operations. It is similar to the hash table constructs in the programming language despite that the
implementation method is designed from the hardware point of view to search data in nearly one cycle.
4the computer industry has been studied for a long period of time, which is used originally in the
prototype design of FPGA, but later this concept is extended through assembling primitive elements to
form new logic function avoiding the waste of specialized human work.
This project is to explore the concept of reconfiguration on the CAM applications. We will first start
from fixed Pre-computation-Based architecture to adaptive architecture design. We reconfigure the
smallest and most important circuit: parameter extractor to achieve the goal of saving energy by the help
of customized computer-aided software designed by ourselves.
1.2 Introduction to CAM Architecture
Figure 0-3the conceptual diagram of conventional CAM.
6Figure 0-5Static pseudo-nMOS CAM word circuit.
This kind of dynamic circuit has many drawbacks, for example, every time a search operation requires
additional time to charge the match line, there are problems of charge sharing and noise margin to
distinguish the voltage level of sense node. A clock signal is also needed to synchronize the CAM
operation. Lin et al. [10] proposed the pseudo-nMOS CAM word architecture to avoid those problems.
The logical level of sense node depends on the result of parameter comparison circuit.
8Figure 0-7Static parameter comparison circuit used in simulation [1].
In the ones count precomputation architecture, the maximum number of ones is 32. The binary
representation needs a total of up to six storage bits to represent the maximum value of 1000002. Figure
1-6 shows the static parameter comparison circuit using reversed logic. The actual parameter was first
stored in node Q, when the scenario of precomputation starts (WL = 0, CLR = 1), the output is 0 if the
value of P matches the value of Q, otherwise, the result will be 1. After all of the parameters exactly
match the stored states, the OR gate will produce logic level 0 to enable the PM1 and the sense node
will be charged to Vdd.

MatchLine, benefits greatly by using these extra transistors to represent its exact function. The inherent
encoding method of one’s count makes it capable of fully using the structure of 7T CAM cell. The truth
table of 9T and 7T CAM cells is as the following:

Although ones count PB-CAM uses 7T CAM cell as the secondary data comparison circuit, this does
not affect the correctness of the lookup operations because the case of malfunction never happens. In

P = For all data, the probability of a two fan-in gate outputting the logic 1 in one block.
0N = For all data, the number of zero entries in one parameter.
1N = For all data, the number of one entries in one parameter.
According to their experimental results, parameter extractors generated by gate-block selection
algorithm have smaller power consumption than the Block-XOR scheme because the Block-XOR
approach is a subset of the Gate-Block selection approach. The detailed computation process will be
described later.
Based on characteristics for some data, [3] proposed an effective heuristic for synthesizing an adaptive
parameter extractor in MiBench [4]. [3] appends the discard and interlace (DAI) concept in front of
parameter extractor design without changing the function of a PB-CAM. The DAI heuristic sorts input
data blocks according to their discrete standard deviation and generate new data by a shifting interlace
operation for later synthesis manipulation. The idea of DAI is to re-order the input data bits to make
parameter values generated by Block-XOR more uniformly. The detailed operations of a DAI are as the
following:

has special significant power reduction on Mibench, but there is not enough mathematical background
to estimate the results of Block-XOR after reordering input data digits. [5] proposes an iterative
algorithm to assess many kinds of DAI varieties. The following figure demonstrates the big picture of an
exhaustive exploration of ten combinations of reordering and synthesis methods:

Figure 0-14 The trend of power consumptions follows standard deviation of parameter memory.
Instead of designing a specified parameter extractor for each data set, we aim to reconfigure the
smallest but the most important extraction circuitry: parameter extractor. The method and related work
will show the operation of gate-block selection algorithm and various DAI varieties quickly. The Result
adds a new data interchange method XML to current EDA tool and this method is proved powerful in
web applications. We also examine the source of power consumption of a PB-CAM, the standard
deviation values of different iterative approaches to propose a brand new reconfigurable PB-CAM
architecture.

The early design estimation approach in [5] enumerates all combinations of DAI methods and two
effective parameter extractor synthesis algorithms in order to explore possible low power PB-CAM for
specified data set. This automated branch and bound algorithm explores ten configurations and

simulation tool.

2.3 A Reconfigurable DAI Architecture
[5] proposes a possible reconfigurable design of parameter extractor through the combination of
different DAI heuristics and Block-XOR. We realize those combinations in several truth tables:

and utilizes XML as a document to record important intermediate results. We can use several data
structures described in algorithm textbooks to model the behavior of a component such as Struct or
Class and use graph algorithms to connect those components intelligently.
This high level modeling of a PB-CAM has some advantages on building reconfigurable concepts over
PB-CAM, therefore, people can focus on designing the important parameter extractors of low power
constraints without worrying about the tedious connections of common hardware modules that those
operations by human are usually error prone.
XML is used as a shared object which can be viewed as a public interface to be consistent in
specification of a proposed design. This document driven approach integrates different flows to
synthesize, simulate a low power PB-CAM design, and track all intermediate processed information in
local XML databases for synchronization of different steps. Next we will also discuss the mechanisms
of ASP.NET to implement a customized electronic design automation software tool.

operation. The mapping stored data words to parameter values is a traditional circuit synthesis problem.
In the following sections, we first describe the transformation from PB-CAM to a logic minimization
question. The DAI approaches are effective means to transform the positions of data words while making
Block-XOR parameter extractor produce values equally. We explore the major power source of blocks and
find out the limitation of gate-block selection algorithm. Finally, a reconfigurable hardware and auxiliary
automation software to help synthesize this kind of PB-CAM are proposed.
3.1 Problem Formulation
Table 3-1 Data words are described by minterms.
Each of the words stored in data memory is referred to as a minterm. Table 3-1 lists minterms of the
eight variables D7, D6, D5, D4, D3, D2, D1, and D0. Each parameter function can be written as a sum of
minterms as in the following equations:

4 Discussion
In order to evaluate our approach, we choose translation look-aside buffer (TLB) as our primary PB-CAM
application, since TLB is the most important memory address lookup function in computer architecture
nowadays. Virtual memory hierarchy uses TLB to speed up the virtual address translation in nearly one CPU
clock cycle. To simulate this scenario, we modify the source code in the computer architecture simulator:
SimpleScalar [7]. SimpleScalar helps engineers simulate their innovative computer architecture by providing
several useful packages such as the specified cross compiler, libraries, and tools to obtain the important
factors like cache hit rate and miss rate. We modify the function "dtlb_access_fn" in sim-cache.c to dump the
address to access the data TLB as the content of major memory block in PB-CAM. The programs used to
execute in SimpleScalar are selected from MiBench and successfully pass the compilation process indicated
in their Makefile scripts. We trace their memory access patterns and dump those addresses into files as our
benchmarks. The other configurations used in our experiments are shown in Tables I, II, III, IV, and V. We
use NanoSim to simulate our Hspice files and give a command to report each block power of our PBCAM
structure. The experiments are conducted by 128 different data addresses and finished by detecting 128
consecutive hit signals for making sure the correctness of our circuit function.

By using this statistical analysis technique of high level estimation, we can synthesize the PB-CAM
consuming the least power efficiently instead of simulating all different types of PB-CAMs in Hspice to
determine which consumes the least power. The experimental results show that the DAI with Block-XOR,
DAI with GSEL approach achieves at least 30%, 29% power reduction respectively compared to the original
Block- XOR and GSEL approaches, so we notice that there is a significant power reduction on PB-CAM
when the DAI approach is applied to the Mibench [6] benchmarks. Besides, the STD of PB-CAM
pre-computation block can be calculated efficiently in all combinations of both (A) data reordering types and
(B) the different kinds of synthesis approaches so that we can quickly estimate the trend of power
consumption from a high-level view and save a great amount of time from Hspice simulation. Our
contribution is the first to propose the significant statistical findings of the different combinations of all
above steps. From observing the experimental results of Block-XOR operation and using the concept of STD

5 Conclusion
In this project, we propose the iterative approach for estimating the tendency towards power consumption
efficiently and determining which type of parameter extractor is superior in power reduction for the specific
data. Our approach is more suitable for the re-configurable design. To achieve the purposes of power
reduction in practical applications, the simulation environments are transferred from Mibench’s benchmark
to the real network data of enterprise currently. And in the future we will discuss the relation between power
consumption and the length of parameters in different levels, making the optimal combinations of PB-CAM
model more complete and more practical.
