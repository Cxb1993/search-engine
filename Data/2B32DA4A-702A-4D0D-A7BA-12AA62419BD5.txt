derived regarding the effect of ISI. A simplified formula is also provided for ease of the
following system analysis. In particular, the optimal integration time for different symbol
durations and channel models is studied. Some special phenomena due to ISI and a univer-

previous methodology, our analytical results provide a more efficient and insightful way to

Introduction
For advanced wireless communications, increasing data rate has always been a major topic.
One of the promising technologies for this demand is ultra-wideband (UWB) [1]– [6]. A
UWB device is widely defined as any device emitting signals with a fractional bandwidth
(bandwidth divided by the center frequency) greater than 20% or a bandwidth of at least
500 MHz (regardless of the fractional bandwidth), at all times of transmission [7]. Because
of its ultra-wide bandwidth and high time resolution, it makes a UWB system particularly
robustness to multipath fading. Besides, UWB systems provide other potential advantages,
such as high data rate capability and coexistence with systems using the same band.
Due to the fine time resolution capability, the Rake receiver is usually used in UWB
systems to take full advantage of signal energy. However, it requires accurate channel esti-
mation which complicates the receiver design. Instead of prior channel estimation, an alter-
native scheme which does not require the information of the transmitted signal or channel is
called transmitted-reference (TR) signaling. The basic idea of TR signaling is transmitting
a reference signal before data for the purpose of determining the current multipath channel
response. For the receiver of a TR system, a simple autocorrelation operation is usually
employed where the received waveform of the reference signal, serving as a dirty channel
estimation, is multiplied to the received waveform of the modulated signal before fed into
1
hence be characterized. Computer simulations are also conducted to verify the preciseness
of our analysis as well as the effectiveness of the proposed rule. Compared with the previous
methodology, which requires extensive simulations, our analytical results provide a more
efficient and insightful way to receiver design and optimization.
The organization of the report is as follows. The overview of IEEE 802.15.3a channel
models and useful channel statistics are presented in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, the signal
and system models are introduced, along with the SINR analysis for TR systems with ISI.
Characterization and approximation of the optimal integration time corresponding to the
maximum SINR are given in Chapter 4. Numerical and simulation results are then provided
in Chapter 5. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Chapter 6.

Γ 7.1 5.5 14.0 24.0
γ 4.3 6.7 7.9 12.0
Note that the path loss and shadowing effects are not included in the path-gain model since
we mainly focus on the multipath effect.
The above channel structure described by (2.1)–(2.4) can comprise several channel models
of interests. For example, when Lc is a point mass approaching infinity, {α(Tl,τk,l)} are com-
plex Gaussian r.v.’s, the cluster and ray inter-arrival times assume exponential distributions
of parameters Λ and λ1, respectively, and, if T0 = 0, one can obtain the complex base-
band channel model defined in [20]. When {α(Tl,τk,l)} are further modified to be real-valued
r.v.’s with log-normal distributed magnitude, the sign of {α(Tl,τk,l)} is equally probable with
{+1,−1}, and T0 is chosen according to the presence of LOS, we have the IEEE 802.15.3a
passband channel structure in absence of the shadowing effect which is described in [24], [30].
In the analysis hereinafter, we will focus on the IEEE 802.15.3a channel structure, and
the parameter specifications for IEEE 802.15.3a channel models are listed in Table 2.1.
Regarding the noise statistics, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of mean zero and
double-side power spectral density N0/2 is assumed.
2.2 Exact Channel Second-Order Joint Moment
In the following two sections, we consider the channel second-order joint moment and fourth-
order joint moment which will be useful to acquire exact channel-averaged results for later
performance analysis. The key is to apply the extended density functions (EDFs) developed
7
where ρ , (1/Γ− 1/γ)−1, and ILOS = 1 when LOS is present and zero elsewhere.
2.3 Fourth-Order Joint Moment
For the fourth-order joint moment of g(t), we first expend it as

According to the assumption on the fourth-order joint moment of the path gains, one can
remove the terms with zero contribution and obtain

3.1 Signal and System Models
3.1.1 Signal Model
In this section, the DTR signal model is considered. The block diagrams of the transmitter
and the receiver are plotted in Fig. 3.1 and 3.2. Denote the data symbols by {bi}, bi ∈
{−1,+1}, and {ai} be the modulated symbols according to ai = ai−1 · bbi/Nsc where each
data symbol is transmitted in Ns successive pulse. The transmitted signal can then be
expressed as [22], [23]
str(t) =
∞∑
i=−∞
aiwtr(t− iTs) (3.1)
where wtr(t) is the transmitted pulse function with unit energy, and Ts is the data symbol
duration. To focus on the high-rate case with severe ISI effect, we will set Ns = 1 hereinafter.
After passed through the multipath channel h(t), the received signal is given by
rrcv(t) = str(t) ∗ h(t) + n(t)
=
∞∑
i=−∞
aig(t− iTs) + n(t)
where g(t) = wtr(t) ∗ h(t) denotes the convolution of the transmitted pulse function and the
channel impulse response, and n(t) is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero
mean and two-sided power spectral density N0/2.

which d[k], ISI[k], and n1[k], n2[k], n3[k] denote the desired signal, intersymbol interference,
and noise related terms, respectively. The summation in ISI[k] excludes (i, j) = (0, 0) and
(i, j) = (−1, 1) because they correspond to the desired signal.
3.2 Average SINR
In this section, we derive the exact average SINR. This power ratio of the desired signal to
the undesired interference plus noise is an important performance index. Previous works,
however, failed to carry out analytical results averaged over the IEEE 802.15.3a channel
statistics. By virtue of the previous analytical framework in [18], [19], this is achieved in the
report, as will be detailed in this section.
We define SINR as

where the second equality comes from the independence between {ai} and g(t). We first
average over the data randomness. Conditioned on dk = 1, it can be checked that
E[aiaj ] =
{
1, if i = j or (i, j) = (k, k − 1) or (i, j) = (k − 1, k)
0, otherwise.

Further applying the result of the channel second-order moments in Section 2.2, one can
obtain

time duration and we assume that
wtr(t)wtr(t+ τ) = 0 for all τ ≥ Ts. (3.12)

In the following, we further calculate the second-order moments. From (3.5), the second-
order moment of E[n21[k]] can be expended as
E[n21[k]] = E

According to (3.10), we can have that E[ai+kaj+k] is 1 if (i, j) = (0,−1), (i, j) = (−1, 0) or
i = j and zero otherwise. It follows that

It is noticed that only fourth-order joint moments of random symbols and the channel are
related. Since the fourth-order joint moment of {ai} is nonzero only when it corresponds to
two pairs of products with nonzero mean. Specifically, we have
E [ai+kaj+k−1ai′+kaj′+k−1] =


1, if (i) E[ai+kaj+k−1] = 1, E[ai′+kaj′+k−1] = 1
or (ii) E[ai+kai′+k] = 1, E[aj+k−1aj′+k−1] = 1
or (iii) E[ai+kaj′+k−1] = 1, E[aj+k−1ai′+k] = 1
0, otherwise.
(3.22)
The equivalent condition on (i, j, i′, j′) for condition (i) can be found to be
(i, j, i′, j′) = (i, i+ 1, i′, i′ + 1) (3.23)

3.3 Simplification of SINR Results
The SINR result derived in Section 3.2 is precise. Yet, complex numerical integrations are
required to evaluate the performance. In this section, we will further simplify the SINR
result so that a closed-form SINR formula can be obtained. This is vital to our analytical
characterization of the optimal energy capture, as will be detailed in Chapter 4.
Because of the ultra-wide bandwidth, the transmitted pulse of an UWB system usually
possesses a small time duration. It is therefore reasonable to assume that
w2tr(t) ≈ δ(t) (3.29)
where δ(t) denotes the Dirac delta function. Consequently, the mean of the desired signal
E[d[k]] can be simplified as
E[d[k]]a =
∫ TI
0
∫ ∞
0
δ(t− t′)q2(t
′)dt′dt
=
∫ TI
0
q2(t)dt.
According to (2.9), the general form of integration over q2(t) can be expressed as∫ T2
T1
q2(t)dt = Ω0
[
ILOSI[T2≥0≥T1] + ΛΓ (1− λρ)
(
e−T1/Γ − e−T2/Γ
)
+λγ (ILOS + Λρ)
(
e−T1/γ − e−T2/γ
)]
. (3.30)
Therefore, E[d[k]]a can be expressed in a closed form:
E[d[k]]a = Ω0
[
ILOS + ΓΛ (1− λρ)
(
1− e−TI/Γ
)
+λγ (ILOS + Λρ)
(
1− e−TI/γ
)]
. (3.31)
For the noise-related moments, the following limit of the sinc function, assuming that its
filter bandwidth W is very large, will be applied:
lim
a→∞
a sinc(at) = δ(t). (3.32)
25
where si(y) = −
∫∞

E

by assuming that the bandwidth approaches infinity.
For the simplification of ISI-related moments, we focus on simplifying the fourth-order
moments of g(t). There are four components in (2.10), corresponding to P2(t1, t2, t3, t4),
P2(t1, t3, t2, t4), P2(t1, t4, t2, t3), and P4(t1, t2, t3, t4). Since P2(t1, t3, t2, t4) and P2(t1, t4, t2, t3)
become small for a short pulse duration, we may simplify the fourth-order moments of g(t)
by P2(t1, t2, t3, t4) + P4(t1, t2, t3, t4). Further applying (3.29), one can have
Ga(i, j, i

Chapter 4
Optimization for DTR Systems
In this chapter, we characterize the optimal integration time for DTR systems. We first
observe that the curve of the optimal integration time versus the symbol duration can be
classified into three regions. In particular, there exists a range of symbol duration where the
optimal integration time is close to the symbol duration. Based on the obtained analysis
results, we are able to analytically characterize this phenomenon. Finally, a universal energy-
capture strategy is proposed for DTR systems to attain good SINR performance over different
symbol durations or, equivalently, different transmission rates.
4.1 Characteristics of the Optimal Integration Time
In Section 3.3, a closed-form SINR formula is derived. But it is difficult to calculate the
optimal integration time analytically since the formula is still kind of complex. Yet, numerical
evaluation can be efficiently carried out to characterize the optimal integration time. In
particular, we will consider the profile of the optimal integration time for different symbol
durations and channel models and study its generic behavior.
In Figs. 4.1 to 4.4, the curves of the optimal integration time versus the symbol duration
for CM1 to CM4 channels are presented. It can be seen that, as Eb/N0 becomes smaller, the

which implies that the receiver can still collect the desired energy faster than the interference.
Therefore, the integration time can be further extended to achieve a better SINR.
Along with the above point of view, we will show that there exists a range of Ts in CM1
to CM4 channels such that

where there is only one normalized derivative for the desired signal since Ds(TI) is continuous
at Ts. On the other hand, according to Section 3.3, the left and right normalized derivatives
of the undesired energy at Ts are distinct due to the ISI term. Therefore, the existence of
the linear region is quite special because of the presence of ISI.
In Fig. 4.5, curves of Ds(Ts), DT,L(Ts) and DT,R(Ts) for CM2 and Eb/N0 = 25 dB are
plotted. In Fig. 4.6, the corresponding curve of the optimal integration time is also shown.

One can check that for symbol duration ranging from 9 ns to 28 ns, the two conditions (4.3)
and (4.4) hold in Fig. 4.5. This then closely predicts the linear region in Fig. 4.6. For other
NLOS CM3 and CM4 channels, we can also see good predictions to the linear regions by
the normalized derivatives in Figs. 4.7–4.10. For LOS CM1 channels, Fig. 4.11 shows that
DI,L(Ts) is always larger than Ds(Ts), which means that the condition (4.3) fails. Hence,
the corresponding optimal integration time does not contain a linear region in Fig. (4.12).
However, a linear region is observed with smaller Eb/N0 for LOS channels. For example, at
Eb/N0 = 15 dB as shown in Fig. 4.11, both the two conditions (4.3) and (4.4) hold. Then
in Fig. 4.14 the corresponding linear region is still closely predicted.
An intuition for the linear range is provided as follows. The ISI includes the interference
from the preceding and the succeeding symbols. Since the succeeding symbols are weighted
by the earlier and stronger path gains, applying an integration time larger than the symbol
duration take in strong interference. Therefore, it is reasonable to choose an integration time
equal to the symbol duration.
Some comments on the small and large symbol duration regions can also be obtained
from the curves of the normalized derivative. One can find that when the symbol duration
less than the linear region, both DT,L(Ts) and DT,R(Ts) are less than Ds(Ts). It means that a
larger integration time can lead to a higher SINR, and thus the optimal integration time no
longer decreases with the symbol duration. Similarly, for a symbol duration greater than the
linear region, both DT,L(Ts) and DT,R(Ts) are greater than Ds(Ts). Therefore, the optimal
integration should be less than the symbol duration.
4.3 A Universal Integration Rule
In this section, we propose a universal rule to approximate the optimal integration time with-
out resorting to numerical search. From the previous section, the optimal integration time
39
for the small symbol duration region. For LOS channels, there is a zero integration time
phenomenon when the symbol duration is small. Therefore, instead of using f(0.7), set
TI = Ts will be a better choice.
By summarizing the above, the following rule for choosing the integration time is proposed
TI,NLOS =


f(0.7), if Ts ≤ f(0.7)
Ts, if f(0.85) ≥ Ts > f(0.7)
f(0.85), if Ts > f(0.85)
(4.9)
for NLOS channels and
TI,LOS =
{
Ts, if Ts ≤ f(0.85)
f(0.85), if Ts > f(0.85)
(4.10)
for LOS channels, where f(x) is defined in (4.8). Note that the above rule is universal
and can provide good integration times for different channel types (NLOS and LOS) and
different symbol dutations. It is also simple and independent of the value of Eb/N0. If the
channel parameters are unknown, the integration time can still be obtained by averaging
the profile of the channel energy versus the delay time and estimating the integration time
corresponding to the targeted mean channel energy.

5.1 Exactness of the Analytical SINR Result
In this section, the exactness of the analytical results for SINR with ISI derived in Section
3.2 is shown. In Figs. 5.1 to 5.4, analytical results for SINR with ISI based on (3.8) are
compared with simulation results. In addition, the approximated SINR is also given. It
can be found that the analytical results match simulation results very well. In Figs. 5.1
and 5.2, the SINR descends suddenly when integration time is about 10ns, which is due
to the effect of ISI. The simplified SINR values are larger than the simulation results since
some components of undesired signal are ignored. Yet, similar tendency to the simulation
results can be observed. Most importantly, the optimal integration times obtained from the
simplified SINR formula agree well with the simulation ones, verifying its usefulness.

5.2 Performance of the Fixed Mean Energy Capture
Correlation Receiver
In this section, the profile of the integration times according to the rule proposed in Sec-
tion 4.3 is compared with the optimal values for CM1 to CM4 channels in Figs. 5.5 to
5.8, respectively. The proposed TI is obtained based on (4.9) and (4.10), and the optimal
integration time is obtained by numerically searching the best point to maximize the SINR
according to (3.44). In Figs. 5.9 to 5.12, the SINR values obtained by the proposed univer-
sal integration rule are compared with the SINR values obtained from numerical search of
the optimal integration time. Although the proposed TI is a approximation to the optimal
integration time, the resulting performances are quite close to these from optimal values.
This is particularly evident in NLOS channels. For LOS channels, the proposed TI leads to
somewhat inferior performance when the symbol duration is small. It is because the zero
correlation time phenomenon arises under this situation. Nevertheless, the proposed TI still

Concluding Remarks
In this report, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the channel-averaged SINR of
DTR systems in the presence of ISI. The statistics of the practical IEEE 802.15.3a UWB
channel models are taken into consideration, and the analytical results are shown to be
accurate by simulation. Based on the analysis results, we can characterize the profiles of the
optimal integration time for different symbol durations and channel models. In particular,
the profiles can be classified into three regions: the small-symbol-duration region, the linear
region, and the large-symbol-duration region. The existence of the linear region is a special
phenomenon due to ISI, which is also well predicted by our analytical results. Based on the
above observation, a universal rule is then proposed to approximate the optimal integration
time. The proposed rule is simple while being able to approach the optimal performance, as
verified in Chapter 5.
Since we are able to approach the optimal SINR for DTR systems of different symbol
durations or, equivalently, different transmission rates, it would be interesting to further
investigate the capabilities of the extended DTR system that can adapt its transmission rate
to SINR. Other possible future work can include extension of the analysis to multiple-user
scenarios and other UWB systems.

Abstract—In this paper, a new construction of quasi-cyclic low-
density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes for unequal error protec-
tion (UEP) is proposed. We ﬁrst give a new class of UEP block
codes. QC-LDPC codes with binomial-term parity-check matrices
which can avoid girths less than 8 and achieve an enlarged upper
bound on the minimum distance are also introduced. An effective
UEP scheme based on the proposed UEP block codes and QC-
LDPC codes which can provide ﬂexible choice of protection levels
is then presented. Simulation results show that the new QC-LDPC
codes can achieve good performance and low error ﬂoors. The
bits with different designed protection levels can indeed have
unequal bit-error-rate performance.
I. INTRODUCTION
Unequal error protection (UEP) [1], [2] means that the
codeword bits can be divided into parts with different error-
correcting capability. Important messages can be provided with
more error protection than less important ones. UEP ﬁnds
many practical applications as broadcast channels, packet-
switching networks, visual communication systems, etc.
Quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes
[3]–[7] are LDPC codes [8] whose parity-check matrices are
usually composed of permutation matrices. They can achieve
near-Shannon-limit performance, with the advantages that they
can be encoded efﬁciently and its algebraic structure allows for
many practical implementations. However, QC-LDPC codes
have a limited upper bound on the minimum distance [3]. In
[4], [7], Type-II QC-LDPC codes with binomial-term parity-
check matrices were proposed to enlarge the upper bound on
the minimum distance. In [7], the structure of Type-II (3, 4)-
regular QC-LDPC codes was analyzed. However, the general
construction for Type-II (3, t)-regular QC-LDPC codes was
not provided. Also there is no guarantee that the girth is larger
than 6 for codes proposed in [7].
Since LDPC codes have outstanding performance, UEP
LDPC codes are desirable. There are two common constructive
methods for UEP LDPC codes. The ﬁrst one is by puncturing
[9], [10]. UEP is achieved by puncturing the bits of a mother
code to obtain required protection levels. The second one is
to design UEP according to the code structure. In [11]–[15],
irregular UEP LDPC codes were designed by considering
the degree distribution of variable nodes. In [16], a lower-
triangular form of the parity-check matrix was introduced for
UEP, but only two levels could be provided. In [17], the
modiﬁed |u|u+ v| structure of Plotkin-type construction was

R.O.C., under Grant NSC 96–2628–E–007–011–MY2.
proposed; however, length-4 cycles could occur in the Tanner
graph. Moreover, the decoding capability of the codes in [17]
may be limited because the multistage decoding rather than the
message-passing decoding [18] is employed and no decoding
is done for the component of codes with short cycles.
In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a new construction of UEP
block codes, of which the parity-check matrices are of the
simple stairway structure. A new construction of QC-LDPC
codes with binomial-term parity-check matrices is also given,
which can achieve an enlarged upper bound on the minimum
distance and guarantee the girth to be at least 8. Based on the
proposed UEP block codes and QC-LDPC codes, UEP QC-
LDPC codes with desired protection levels can be obtained.
The low error ﬂoor and UEP capability of the new codes are
then veriﬁed by computer simulations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A general
construction of UEP block codes is described in Section II.
Section III presents a new construction of regular QC-LDPC
codes, along with the upper bound on the minimum distance
and conditions for the girth to be at least 8. Then in Section
IV, new UEP QC-LDPC codes are given. Simulation results
are shown in Section V for performance veriﬁcation. Finally,
the work is concluded in Section VI.
II. A NEW CONSTRUCTION OF UEP BLOCK CODES
In this section, we ﬁrst give a new construction of UEP
block codes. For the codes of length ln, we can divide the
codeword bits into l parts and each part has different error
protection capability. Consider H1 and H2 as the m×n non-
zero matrices with n > m and 0 the m × n all-zero matrix.
We have the following construction.
[New Construction of UEP Block Codes]
The lm×ln parity-check matrix of the length-ln block code
with UEP is given by
Huep =
⎛⎜⎜⎜⎝
H1 H2 0 0 · · · 0
0 H1 H2 0 · · · 0
...
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
...
0 0 0 · · · H1 H2
0 0 0 · · · 0 H1
⎞⎟⎟⎟⎠ . (1)
Part: |-1-| |-2-| |-3-| · · · · · · · · · · · · |-l-|
This construction can be viewed as a generalization of
the overlapping structure in [1] which can provide two-level
UEP only. We then proceed to explain why this structure can
achieve UEP. Represent the codeword in the following form:
c = (b1, b2, · · · bln)

for odd t where IPi,j is a p × p identity matrix with rows
cyclically shifted to the left by Pi,j positions and 0 is the
p× p all-zero matrix.
For this construction, an upper bound on the minimum
distance can be obtained in the following theorem.
Theorem 2: For the (3, t)-regular QC-LDPC codes ob-
tained by the new construction, the minimum distance is upper-
bounded by Bd, where
Bd =
⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩
32, t = 4
28, t = 5
24, t ≥ 6 and t is even
12, t ≥ 7 and t is odd.
From Theorem 2, our constructed (3, t) codes for even t
can have an upper bound on the minimum distance greater
than or equal to the original upper bound, (3 + 1)! = 24, of
QC-LDPC codes constructed from monomials.
We now assign some speciﬁc values to the Pi,j’s in the
parity-check matrices of the new QC-LDPC codes to ensure
that the resulting codes have no cycles of lengths 4 and 6. We
can have the following theorem.
Theorem 3: Consider (3, t)-regular QC-LDPC codes in our
new construction with shifting values Pi,j given by
Pi,j = a
j−1bi−1
for i = 1, 2, 3, and j = 1, 2, · · · , t. Then the corresponding
Tanner graph has a girth at least 8 if we take a = α3 and
b = αK , where α is a primitive 3Kth root of unity in GF(p),
αi = p− 1 for i = 0, 1, . . . , 3K, and K ≥ t with 3  K.
This theorem can be proved by checking the extension of
the cycle existence conditions [5] of QC-LDPC codes with
monomials only. Our constructed codes hence have good girth
properties.
Example 1: Consider a (3, 4)-regular QC-LDPC code by
our new construction with parity-check matrix given by
H =
(
I1 + I9 0 I20 + I58 0
I47 I57 I25 I42
0 I13 + I56 0 I16 + I22
)
.
It is of rate 0.25. The shifting values following Theorem 3
are given by a = 9 and b = 47 in GF(61). The corresponding
Tanner graph has a girth of 8. And from Theorem 2, the upper
bound on the minimum distance is now 32. Also consider a
(3, 4)-regular QC-LDPC code of rate 0.25 obtained form the
previous construction in (2) with parity-check matrix given by
H =
(
I1 I11 I60 I50
I47 I29 I14 I52
I13 I21 I48 I40
)
.
The upper bound on the minimum distance is then 24.
Example 2: Consider a (3, 5)-regular QC-LDPC code by
our new construction with parity-check matrix given by
H =
(
I1 + I354 0 I279 + I252 0 I377
I400 I144 I35 I181 I82
0 I20 + I344 0 I107 + I409 I383
)
.
It is of rate 0.4. The shifting values following Theorem 3 are
given by a = 354 and b = 400 in GF(421). The corresponding
Tanner graph has a girth of 8. And from Theorem 2, the upper
bound on the minimum distance is now 28. Also consider a
(3, 5)-regular QC-LDPC code of rate 0.4 obtained form the
previous construction in (2) with parity-check matrix given by
H =
(
I1 I354 I279 I252 I377
I400 I144 I35 I181 I82
I20 I344 I107 I409 I383
)
.
The upper bound on the minimum distance is then 24.
IV. NEW UEP QC-LDPC CODES
In this section, UEP LDPC codes will be constructed by
combining the UEP construction in Section II with the new
QC-LDPC codes in Section III. For our new UEP structure
in (1), if H1 and H2 are parity-check matrices of QC-LDPC
codes, the whole code is also a QC-LDPC code. We can give
speciﬁc parity-check matrices H˜1 and H˜2 as
H˜1 =
(
IP1,1 + IP1,2 0 · · · IP1,t−1 + IP1,t 0
IP2,1 IP2,2 · · · IP2,t−1 IP2,t
0 IP3,1 + IP3,2 · · · 0 IP3,t−1 + IP3,t
)
and
H˜2 =
(
IP1,t+1 0 IP1,t+3 0 · · · IP1,2t−1 0
0 0 0 0 · · · 0 0
0 IP3,t+2 0 IP3,t+4 · · · 0 IP3,2t
)
.
It is clear that H˜1 is in the form (3) of a (3, t)-regular QC-
LDPC code with even t. And H˜2 is given to connect each
level. We can then obtain the following corollaries:
Corollary 1: Suppose the nullity of
(
H˜2
T
H˜1
T
)T
is
one. If the block length p > 256/t, then the two-level UEP
QC-LDPC codes with H˜1 and H˜2 have the property that
d1 < d2.
Proof: Consider the codeword c∗2 = (v1 = 0,v2 = 0). We
have
v2
(
H˜2
H˜1
)T
= 0.
Since the nullity of
(
H˜2
T
H˜1
T
)T
is one, the only solution
other than 0 is v2 = (1, 1, · · · , 1). So we have wH(c∗2) = tp >
256. By using a method similar to that in [3] to ﬁnd the upper
bound on d2, we can obtain d2 ≤ 256. So wH(c∗2) = d2. By
Theorem 1, we have d1 < d2. 
Corollary 2: Suppose the nullity of
(
H˜2
T
H˜1
T
)T
is
one. If the block length p > 512/t, then the three-level UEP
QC-LDPC codes with H˜1 and H˜2 have the property that
d1 < d2 < d3.
The proof is similar to that of Corollary 1. These two corol-
laries ensure that the codes satisfying the sufﬁcient conditions
indeed possess the UEP capability.
The codes with no cycles of length less than 8 can be
obtained by modifying Theorem 3 as follows.
Corollary 3: Consider the repeated part
(
H˜1 H˜2
)
in
our construction with shifting values Pi,j given by
Pi,j = a
j−1bi−1

with equal error protection, as described in Example 3. Both
codes are with girth 8 and of rate 0.25. It can be seen that our
constructed code has two different levels of error protection.
And the bits of level 2 have better performance than those of
the equal error protection code. The averaged error rate of all
codeword bits is very close to that of UEP level-1 bits.
Fig. 4. shows the performance of the three-level UEP QC-
LDPC code by our construction and that of the QC-LDPC code
with equal error protection, as described in Example 4. Both
codes are with girth 8 and of rate 0.25. It can be observed that
there are three error protection levels for our constructed code
and the bits of level 2 and 3 can have better performance than
those of the equal error protection code. The averaged error
rate of all codeword bits is almost the same as that of UEP
level-1 bits.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new general construction of UEP block
codes with simple stairway parity-check matrices is provided.
Moreover, new QC-LDPC codes are introduced. By employing
binomial terms in the parity-check matrix, not only the girth of
at least 8 can be guaranteed but also the larger upper bound on
the minimum distance can be obtained. New UEP QC-LDPC
codes can then be obtained based on the above two approaches.
Simulation results show that the new QC-LDPC codes can
have better BER performance at high SNRs and lower error
ﬂoors than previously constructed codes. And our UEP QC-
LDPC codes can indeed achieve different error protection
levels, with some parts of bits having better performance
than those of equal error protection QC-LDPC codes. Possible
future work can include extension of the constructions to
higher-rate codes and the encoding problem of information
bits in different UEP levels.
