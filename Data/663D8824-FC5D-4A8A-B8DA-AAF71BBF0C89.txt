一 Introduction
Friction is inevitable in servo motion and will
deteriorate the tracking performances if
without being properly manipulated. In
applications where the Coulomb and the
viscous friction dominate, model-based
adaptive compensation schemes are especially
attractive for their unique feature of ensuring
the asymptotic tracking stability under
parametric uncertainty [1]. In contrast, the
fruitful phenomena occurring in low-velocity
regime, such as stick-slip, pre-sliding,
time-lag etc., are difficult to handle in terms of
both modeling and control designs. In the
respect of modeling, the exponential model
captures essential features of low-velocity
friction while retains relatively simple form
and is therefore adopted [1]. The major
difficulty is its nonlinear-in-parameter feature
which prohibits the direct application of
standard adaptive control methodologies.
One common remedy for that is to resemble
the model with a linear combination of a set of
suitable basis functions, after which linear
error equation can then be constructed
successfully. To minimize the degradation in
tracking performances, apparently,
approximation error should be kept as small as
possible.
NN, for its flexibility and capability of
uniformly approximating continuous functions
to arbitrary accuracy via employing sufficient
nodes, is now popular in many friction
compensation designs recently [2]. However,
to the best of our knowledge, benefits of prior
knowledge of friction have not been fully
utilized in most of the related designs. Though
NN is basically a model-free approximator,
nevertheless, it is found that the accuracy of
approximation can be improves significantly
via incorporating prior knowledge of the
friction. The main idea arises from that
stretching a time signal will squeeze its
bandwidth, a well-known property in signal
processing theory [3]. Therefore, scaling the
friction model by dividing it with its
upper-bound function will flatten its extend in
the velocity axis and hence, smaller truncation
error can be obtained with the same number of
neurons. Next, by multiplying the output of
the NN the inverse of that modulation function
will produce a resemblance of the model
function plus less approximation uncertainty.
The tracking performances can then be
improved significantly.

With m being a non-negative integer
and cc v/  . It is noted that the sine
functions have been excluded in (8) since
)(vf t is an even function.
For tackling the possible degradation in
tracking performances caused by the resulting
approximation errors, quantitative analysis of
which is essential and will be investigated
here. The first error source comes from
truncating )(vf d at cv for periodic
expansion. The bound for the difference
dtt ffd  can be estimated as
ct

t vvevd sc   ,)(

and 0td for cvv  . The other error
source comes apparently from truncating the
infinite Fourier series in (8) at the thn )'1( 
term. For deciding the amount of the robust
control ru in (3), the error bound for the
finite-term approximation error is
indispensable. Such a bound will be shown to
be closely related to the spectrum of )(vf t
defined by [7]

Based on these results, compensation design
for tackling degradation in tracking

developed.
三 Compensation Designs
Though neural network is basically a
model-free approximator, it'll first be shown
here that the bound in (16) can be effectively
reduced if 3 and the bound for sv are
known a priori. The main idea arises from a
well-known fact in signal processing that
stretching a time signal will squeeze its
bandwidth. Therefore, the error bound for

四 Numerical Examples
Simulation for demonstrating the validity of
the proposed design is conducted in this
section. The reference trajectory is
)01.0sin(0.1)( ttxd  , which results in a
relatively low velocity command in order that
the system can traverse the low-velocity
regime for most of the time. The adopted
system and control parameters are
