一、Introduction 二、Method 
 When a rigid body collides with a surface, a layer 
of dust on the surface can be resuspended, owing to 
the effects of hydrodynamic. In a previous 
experimental study, [1] examined details as a 
function of Reynolds number for 300<Re<3500. [2] 
examined experimentally particle–wall collisions 
for Reynolds numbers between 10 and 3000 and 
showed that the rebound was primarily a function of 
the Stokes number. The vortex-ring system 
generated during the impact shows similarities to 
that produced from the impact of an isolated vortex 
ring with a wall.  
2.1  Pressure correction method 
  The pressure correction method is briefly 
introduced.  The incompressible Navier -Stokes 
equations of a laminar flow can be written as

has the following structures: at the time step

  We focuses on (1) the formation and evolution of 
the vortex-ring system associated with an impact; (2) 
the vortex dynamics associated with rebound 
relative to the case of sudden arrest. The problem is 
investigated through a combined numerical and 
experimental study.

where   In this paper, a direct-forcing immersed- 
boundary (IB) pressure correction method is used 
[3]. The velocity field of a fluid is solved by a 
pressure correction method [4,5]. The pressure 
correction method is first to compute a predictor 
velocity. Next we use a divergence-free velocity 
restriction rule to correct the pressure and velocity 
field. In the pressure correction method, a Poisson 
equation was usually introduced for computing the 
pressure field to make sure a divergence-free 
velocity field. To avoid the checker-board pressure 
field occurred, a staggered grid system is used to 
simulate the flow fields. For capturing the particle 
motion in a flow, the immersed-boundary (IB) 
method is often used [6,7]. The IB method 
introduces an immersed boundary force density to 
capture the particle motion. To avoid complicated 
interpolations and transformations of the force 
density on the boundary points to flow elements, a 
direct forcing method [3] is used in this paper.

We use a second-order upwind finite volume 
method to discretize the convection operators and 
the second-order central difference method to 
discretize the diffusion operators. For the detailed

  A non-uniform Cartesian grid used in the 
simulations. The grid points are clustered around 
the sphere. In the immersed boundary region that 
embeds the sphere a uniform mesh of equal

extends over the sub-domain, 3],[ DD , D is the 
diameter of the sphere. Outside this region, a 
geometric stretching is used. The overall grid

system around a sphere on the symmetry plane, y=0. 
For the boundary conditions, the inflow and outflow 
boundary conditions are used in the streamwise 
direction. The slip boundary condition is used at the 
est and the coarse grids defined as differ
two spanwise directions. 
  First we establish the number of grids needed of 
grid points needed within the immersed boundary 
region in order to achieve adequate resolution of the 
spherical particle. The particular case considered is 
characterized by U=0.1 and Re=10. Four different 
levels of resolution are used (D = 12, 16, 20, 24). 
The drag coefficients for the different simulations 
are presented in Table 1. The finest grid results are 
taken to be the baseline and percentile difference

the results to be presented (unless otherwise stated) 
are obtained with a resolution of D = 20. Figure 2 
shows the streamlines and pressure contours on the 
symmetry plane (y=0). One can see the flow 
structures are axis symmetry and do not reveal any 
streamline to pass through the sphere by the 
proposed IB pressure correction method. Next, we

3.2  two dimension normal impact collision 
  For this section, the cylinder is started from rest, 
travels a distance L through the fluid at a constant

of contact with the wall. We perform simulations on 
the sedimentation of a single sphere falling with a 
fixed speed., the computational domain employed 
in the simulation is [-10D,10D] [0,20D], D =120, 
along the wall-normal (stream-wise) and two 
spanwise directions. The sphere was initially rest 
and its center was placed at (4.5D,0,0), then it 
suddenly moved in y-direction to the wall at a
constant speed U. We will compare with  [10]

Therefore, If we has the coefficient of thermal expansion (α), the Young's modulus (E), Poisson ratio (ν), we can obtain 
static deformation of each element node by Eqs. (4)-(6).  
On the part of thermal analysis, the thermal elements such as Solid 87 and Solid 90 are used. Since the effects of 
convection and radiation on the door surface are considered, the element Surf152 is also used on the panels facing the 
furnace. In the structural analysis, the structural elements such as Solid 186 and Solid 187 are used. 
 
3. Results and Discussions 
A steel fire safety door has the dimensions of 1.080m width, 2.00m height, and 64mm depth. It is consisted of 
Galvanized steel board, Magnesium oxide board, Perlite board, Ceramic fiber, and Iron. The hardware fittings of the 
door include of lock, tamper latch, and hinge. We investigate the unexposed temperature distribution and deformation 
under two-hour heating with the UL10C time-dependent elevated temperature curve. 
Fig.1 shows the temperature and deflection measurement locations on the unexposed side, T11~T15 are for temperature 
measurement, and D1~D8 are for deflection measurement. Fig.2 shows the comparisons of the unexposed temperature 
histories at the measurement positions. The position of the highest temperature situates at the door edge where means 
the location of steel skeleton. The steel skeleton is composed of galvanized steel board and steel and the heat can 
transfer effectively from the exposed side to the unexposed side by mechanism due to the galvanized steel board and 
steel are thermal conductivity well. The temperature around the lock is slightly lower than the steel skeleton. This is due 
to the surface of the steel coated by MgO board and ceramic fiber which will decrease the heat transfer rate. According 
to the result of simulation, the temperature at the region of gauging point is approximately 99℃, and the experimental 
value is approximately 96℃, both the results are well matched. Also, one can see that the temperature from the 
experiment data is raised rapidly from 2000 seconds to 2500 seconds. We gauss this is due to chemical reaction 
since the sandwich board and laminated plank in the door are belonged to the chemical composite insulation material. In 
this study, the chemical reaction is not considered in this simulation. After 2500 seconds, the good comparisons between 
experiment data and numerical results are presented.
