本計劃研究主要目的為建構一磨料噴射精微拋光系統並開發其製程技術，探
討磨料噴射對於放電表面精微拋光的可行性及其效率改善。藉由複合添加劑的添
加，可明顯地延緩表面硬化時間，增加拋光改善效率，結果發現經由田口實驗所
獲得之磨料噴射最佳參數水準組合，能以#2000SiC 與添加劑混合比例 500: 1000: 
1500(水蠟: 磨料: 水)條件下，可於 90 min 時將表面粗糙度 7.74 μm Rmax 的放
電表面改善至 0.45 μm Rmax，且表面呈現近似鏡面反射效果。再者利用霧化法

善，實驗結果得知對於 2.32 μm Rmax 的微溝槽可於 30min 將其改善至 0.31 μm 
Rmax。另外針對雕模放電之模穴經由 90min 的拋光處理，由粗糙度的變化得知

研究目的 
近年來，學者們逐漸提出許多高精度的拋光技術運用到精密模具表面拋光，
如化學拋光（Chemical Polishing, CP）、電解拋光（Electropolishing, EP）、磨粒流
拋光(Abrasive Flow Machining, AFM)與磁力研磨拋光（Magnetic Polishing, MP）
等。前述眾多非傳統拋光方式，雖皆能將工件表面粗糙度有效降低，但卻都有對
環境或成本的不良影響存在，如化學拋光、電解拋光或電化學研磨拋光缺點為需
依不同工件材料，選擇不同拋光液或電解液，而拋光液或電解液常具腐蝕性，且
拋光後溶液回收不容易，對環境及人體皆有不良影響。磁力研磨拋光常對於高硬
度、高強度的鋼材(如WC合金等)，必須使用高成本鑽石磁性磨料，否則拋光效
果明顯不佳，且磨料於拋光後回收不易。磨粒流拋光除設備昂貴外，另因使用磨
料具黏彈性，容易造成設備磨耗損壞，且導致工件於拋光後清洗不易且清洗過程
繁雜，非常費時費力。故如何發展出高效率、操作簡便與低成本的精密拋光技術，
以獲得細緻的模具表面就成為非常值得研究與探討的課題。 
針對這方面的問題，本研究提出磨料噴射精微拋光技術，利用高壓氣體輔助
磨粒對微精密模具表面產生研磨加工效果【2】，而達到高精密拋光的目的，同
時能減少磨料用量，使具有回收容易、價格低廉等優點，不僅有助於製程改善，
品質的提升亦會對產品競爭力大有幫助。

磨料噴射加工參數最適化  
本研究完成磨料噴射拋光系統及系統性能分析後，由於系統參數與加工參數
繁雜，為獲得重要參數與較佳設定值，研究利用田口品質工程進行直交表
(Orthogonal Arrays)進行實驗設計，並利用變異數分析輔助探討磨料噴射加工法

表面特性探討-微硬度試驗 
由於磨料噴射拋光法為類似珠擊加工方式，使磨粒以高速持續撞擊延性材料
工件表面時，容易在表面形成不均勻塑性變形，而產生壓縮殘留應力(Compressive 
Residual Stress)，使延性材料表面強度與硬度增加。使用 Micro-Vickers 微硬度計直
接量測經#8000SiC 磨料噴射拋光後之工件(0.13 μm Ra)、放電表面(1.0 μm Ra)與
SKD61 原始母材三種表面之微硬度，微硬度計的壓子(Indentor)負荷設定 50 g，時
間 30 sec，藉此觀察磨料噴射拋光法隨拋光時間增加時，對於延性材料表面是否會
產生硬化現象，而影響其表面拋光改善效果。 
圖 11 為三種不同表面微硬度量測結果，由於放電加工後表面會形成ㄧ層硬脆
再鑄層，因此放電表面微硬度量測值偏高(57.86 HRC)，而經磨料噴射拋光後之工
件表面，因再鑄層已被移除，故所量測微硬度值明顯下降至 27.9 HRC，而 SKD61
母材表面微硬度量測值為 22.6 HRC，表示放電表面硬度值＞拋光表面硬度值＞
SKD61 母材表面硬度值。因此可證明磨料噴射拋光法隨著拋光時間增加，當再鑄
層完全移除，且逐漸至 SKD61 母材表面時，其工件表面確實會受磨粒高速且大量
持續的撞擊，而產生類似珠擊現象，導致表面逐漸硬化，使硬度提高。

表面特性探討-加工表面成份分析 
本節主要探討以 SiC 磨料對 SKD61 模具鋼表面進行磨料噴射精微拋光後，其
加工表面之 Si 元素含量是否會改變，藉此證明表面硬化現象除了珠擊效應存在
外，是否尚存在些許 SiC 嵌入現象，故研究將 SKD61 母材、放電製程表面與經磨
料噴射拋光後之三組工件分別作表面定性、定量分析與 Mapping 分析。結果顯示
經磨料噴射拋光後之工件表面 Si 元素含量(1.84 %)確實較 SKD61 母材表面 Si 元素

添加液態潤滑劑之影響 
本節研究發現表面硬化現象為影響磨料噴射拋光法對於延性材料表面改善的
主要因素。為能改善表面硬化現象產生，使表面粗糙度能持續獲得改善。本節以
混合磨料之添加劑種類為探討參數，藉由添加劑披覆於磨料表面(參考圖 13)，期望
有效緩衝磨料對表面之切削力，藉以提升磨粒滑動研磨效果，進而大幅降低工件
表面粗糙度，其拋光示意如圖 13 所示。 
 
圖 13 複合添加劑拋光示意圖 
 
液態潤滑劑-水溶性加工油 
圖 14 為水溶性加工油不同混合比例對於表面粗糙度改善的影響，可明顯得知
在相同加工條件下，在加工初期對於放電表面的再鑄層均能有效地移除，但因水
溶液對磨粒緩衝力較為不足，使磨粒不易產生滑動研磨效果，導致在 20 min 後，
表面粗糙度改善值僅至 0.27~0.29 μm Ra 即趨於平緩，無法繼續表面改善。但改以
水溶性加工油與水溶液混合比例 1: 1 的複合添加劑時，雖加工初期對表面粗糙度
改善較為緩慢，但由於水溶性加工油相較水溶液對磨粒有更佳的緩衝潤滑效果，
並能均勻披覆於磨粒表面，所以可大幅提升磨粒滑動研磨效果及明顯延緩表面硬
化現象產生，使#2000SiC 磨料能在 120 min 後將 1.0 μm Ra(7.74 μm Rmax)表面
粗糙度持續改善至 0.19 μm Ra(1.16 μm Rmax)。

微溝槽拋光加工 
微溝槽被廣泛使用於如微機電系統中的微型散熱片，但目前生產微型散熱片
還是以模具為主要製作方式，其缺點為製造過程繁瑣且品質不易掌握，相對成本
不易降低，因此若能有效改善微型散熱片模具的表面精度，相信不但可降低其製
造成本、提升品質，更可大幅縮短模具製程時間。本研究利用#3000 蠟砂結合添加
劑混合比例 500: 1000: 1500(水蠟: 磨料: 水)探討對微溝槽加工表面的拋光改善效
果。由圖 21 中發現#3000 蠟砂對於表面粗糙度 0.24 μm Ra(2.32 μm Rmax)的微溝
槽，因蠟砂經由水蠟與表面固態蠟雙重的緩衝效果與 SiC 磨粒銳角僅些微露出固
體蠟表面的特點，使大粒徑磨料具有小粒徑磨料的微量研磨效果，所以可更有效
減緩磨粒對表面切削痕跡，同時降低表面 Rmax 值，並能隨加工時間增加而持續改
善其表面粗糙度，因此在 30 min 內，能將表面粗糙度改善至 0.06 μm Ra(0.31 μm 
Rmax)。

真空吸引力對微流道拋光的影響 
由圖 25 可以發現直線型微流道出口處若無加入真空吸引的力量，容易使磨料
在高深寬比的流道中失去動能，而導致在同樣加工條件下表面粗糙度改善十分緩
慢，甚至幾乎沒有改善效果。而當增加 60 cmHg 的真空吸引力之後，可維持磨料
在高深寬比的流道中之動能，大幅提升磨料的流暢性，進而提高磨料切削力，使
#1000SiC 磨料可在 60 min 內改善至 0.06 μm 的鏡面效果，明顯優於無加入真空吸
引力時在 60 min 內只能改善至 0.12 μm Ra 的表面拋光效果，且入出口表面粗糙

Abstract
This study introduces an abrasive jet polishing (AJP) technique in which the pneumatic air stream carries not only abrasive particles,
but also an additive of either pure water or pure water with a speciﬁed quantity of machining oil. Taguchi design experiments are
performed to identify the optimal AJP parameters when applied to the polishing of electrical discharge machined SKD61 mold steel
specimens. A series of experimental trials are then conducted using the optimal AJP parameters to investigate the respective effects of the
additive type and the abrasive particle material and diameter in achieving a mirror-like ﬁnish of the polished surface. The Taguchi trials
indicate that when polishing is performed using pure water as an additive, the optimal processing parameters are as follows: an abrasive
material to additive ratio of 1:2, an impact angle of 301, a gas pressure of 4 kg/cm2, a nozzle-to-workpiece height of 10mm, a platform
rotational velocity of 200 rpm, and a platform travel speed of 150mm/s. Applying these processing parameters, it is found that the
optimal polishing effect is attained using #8000SiC abrasive particles and a 1:1 mixture of water-solvent machining oil and pure water.
The experimental results show that under these conditions, the average roughness of the electrical discharge machined SKD61 surface is
reduced from an original value of Ra ¼ 1.03 mm (Rmax: 7.74mm) to a ﬁnal value of Ra ¼ 0.13 mm (Rmax: 0.90mm), corresponding to a
surface roughness improvement of approximately 87%.

1. Introduction
As the geometrical forms of engineering and commercial
products become increasingly complex, the requirement for
sophisticated micro-machining techniques capable of fab-
ricating highly precise molds has emerged as a major
concern [1]. However, the high hardness, high strength and
high toughness characteristics of many of today’s engineer-
ing materials prevent the application of traditional
machining techniques to the machining of complex,
miniature structures [2]. Accordingly, the electrical dis-
charge machining (EDM) technique has emerged as the
method of choice for mold fabrication. Although EDM
provides a cost-effective solution for the machining of a
wide variety of materials with diverse mechanical proper-
ties, the machining process leaves a large number of craters
on the machined surface. Additionally, localized cooling
effects and material structural changes induce micro-
cracking within the workpiece surface. As a result, the
surface quality of EDM-machined surfaces tends to be
rather poor [3,4]. The surface defects not only scratch the
molded products during the mold-off operation, but also
reduce the life expectancy of the mold itself. Therefore, it is
essential to develop effective techniques for removing the
recast layer from the mold surface following the machining
process. Although several micro-EDM machines have been
proposed which minimize the thickness of the recast layer,
they are rather expensive and require extremely long
machining times to obtain the required surface ﬁnish. As
a result, many researchers have attempted to improve the
quality of EDM-machined surfaces by establishing the
optimal discharge parameters, designing enhanced electro-
des, introducing abrasive particles into the machining

rotational velocity, the X–Y platform travel speed, the
additive type, and the mixing ratio of the abrasive material
to the additive.
Prior to the polishing operation, the abrasives (i.e. SiC or
Al2O3 particles) are mixed in the speciﬁed ratio with the
additive ﬂuid, i.e. pure water or pure water with a pre-
determined quantity of solvent machining oil. During the
polishing operation, the high pneumatic pressure of the air
stream prompts a siphon effect within the mixing chamber
that causes the abrasives and additives to be sucked into
the air delivery pipe and delivered to the nozzle along with
the air.
2.2. Experimental materials
The current polishing tests were performed using non-
heat treated SKD61 mold steel (SKD61 (JIS) ¼ H11
(AISI)) with a hardness of HRC 20–23. Initially, the
workpieces were machined using a surface grinder
to produce a glossy, smooth ﬁnish. Thereafter, a Sodick
EDM system was employed to process the workpieces
to create various surface roughness characteristics, i.e.
Ra ¼ 1.0, 1.7 or 8 mm, respectively. Finally, the roughened
workpieces were cut into experimental specimens with
dimensions of 10mm 10mm 5mm using a wire EDM
technique.
The EDM-machined SKD61 specimens were polished
using either SiC or Al2O3 abrasive particles, as shown in
Fig. 2. Comparing the two images, it is apparent that the
SiC particles are characterized by a large number of
irregular, shape surface features, whereas the Al2O3
particles have a relatively smooth appearance. The SiC
particles have a comparatively high hardness, i.e. Mohs
Hardness 9.5, while the Al2O3 particles have a lower
hardness of 7 (Mohs Hardness).
2.3. Experimental method
In the present Taguchi design, the machining quality is
quantiﬁed in terms of the surface roughness following the
polishing operation. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the
Taguchi trials were conducted using seven ﬁxed factors and
six variable control factors (each with three levels). In
addition to exploring the effects on the machining quality
of the six control factors listed in Table 2, it was also
desired to establish the inﬂuence of the abrasive granule
diameter. As shown in Table 3, the granule diameter factor
was assigned three levels. The Taguchi experiments were
conﬁgured using a Double Orthogonal Array, in which the
six control factors were arranged in an L18 Orthogonal

setting is indicated by the bold entry in columns 1, 2 and 3.
Fig. 3 plots the S/N response data in a graphical form.
Overall, the Taguchi results indicate that the factor level
combination which ensures the optimal surface roughness
is A1B1C3D1E1F2. However, in an experimental validation
test, it was found that when polishing was performed
without rotating the platform (i.e. E1: 0 rpm), the specimen
was deformed following a prolonged period of machining.
This is clearly undesirable since it degrades the dimensional
accuracy of the workpiece. Accordingly, the subsequent
polishing experiments were performed with Factor E
set to its second-best level setting, i.e. level 3 (200 rpm).
In other words, the optimal factor level combination
for the AJP polishing operation was determined to be
A1B1C3D1E3F2.
3.1.1. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
In general, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) data
derived from the Taguchi experimental results provide an
indication of the signiﬁcance of the individual control
factors and their interactions. Table 6 presents the
ANOVA results for the current Taguchi AJP trials.
As shown, the table gives the ANOVA results for the
sum of squares of the variance and the mean square of
the variance of the S/N response of each of the six
control factors at each level. The results show that the
variances associated with the nozzle-to-workpiece height,
the platform rotational velocity and the X–Y platform
travel speeds are much lower than those of the other
factors. In other words, changes in the values of these
particular processing parameters have only a slight effect
on the surface roughness of the machined workpiece.
Furthermore, if the L18 Orthogonal Array is arranged with
a saturation experiment design, a total of 17 degrees of
freedom are available when evaluating the effect of the
individual factors. However, in the current experiments,
the effects of just six control variables are considered.
Therefore, a total of 12 degrees of freedom can be used to
evaluate the effects of the different factors. As a result, ﬁve
error degrees of freedom exist in the current trials.
The corresponding errors in the sum of squares of the
variance and the mean variance, respectively, are indicated
in Table 6.
Table 6 also presents the F-test results for the six control
variables to provide a further indication of the inﬂuence of
each of the experimental factors and their interactions on
the quality characteristic. Note that the signiﬁcance level is
speciﬁed as 0.05, while the high signiﬁcance level is
speciﬁed as 0.01. The results indicate that the theoretical
boundary values are F0.05 (2, 5) ¼ 5.79 and F0.01 (2, 5) ¼
13.27, respectively. Therefore, it can be inferred that the
factors having the greatest inﬂuence on the surface rough-
ness of the polished specimens are the ratio of the abrasive
particles to the additive, the impact angle, and the gas
pressure. Moreover, of these three factors, it is seen that the
impact angle and the gas pressure have the most signiﬁcant
effect.
3.1.2. Confirmatory experiments
To investigate the reliability of the Taguchi experimental
results, two conﬁrmatory experiments were conducted
using #2000SiC abrasive particles under the optimal factor
level combination obtained from the Taguchi trials. The
corresponding results are presented in Table 7. It is
observed that a very slight discrepancy exists between the
experimental roughness improvement rate and the pre-
dicted value. However, overall, the results indicate that
the optimal factor level combination of A1B1C3D1E3F2
achieves a consistent improvement in the surface roughness
of the machined workpiece. In other words, the optimal
AJP parameters are as follows: an abrasive material to
additive ratio of 1:2, an impact angle of 301, a gas pressure

apparent that the time required to attain a stable surface
roughness condition is directly related to the initial
roughness of the machined surface. During the early stage
of the polishing operation (e.g. the ﬁrst 20min), the hard,
brittle characteristics of the recast layer on the EDM
surface and the numerous, widely distributed micro-pores
and cracks increase the susceptibility of the recast layer to
chipping and ﬂaking under the high-speed, high-pressure
impact of the #2000SiC abrasive particles. Therefore, the
surface roughness improves rapidly and the material
removal rate is signiﬁcantly increased. Under these
conditions, the machining mechanism is mainly one of
cutting removal, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 6(a). In
the intermediate machining period (e.g. 20–90min), the
recast layer on the surface has already been completely
removed and the surface is gradually ﬂattened by the
continuous bombardment of high-velocity SiC particles. As
shown in Fig. 6(b), during this stage of the polishing
process, the #2000SiC abrasive particles start to erode the
SKD61 substrate because their hardness is far greater than
that of the substrate material. The continuous high-speed
impact of a large number of #2000SiC abrasive particles on
the surface of the substrate material produces a ball-impact
effect which induces surface hardening. Furthermore,
during the blasting of the SKD61 substrate, some
fragments of the #2000SiC abrasive material become
embedded in the substrate surface causing a further
hardening effect. These two surface hardening phenomena
are responsible for the saturation in the material removal
rate observed in Fig. 4(b). In the ﬁnal stage of the
machining operation (i.e. after 90min), the machined
surface is already relatively ﬂat (see Fig. 6(c)) and the
ball-impact effect and superﬁcial embedment of SiC
particles cause a signiﬁcant increase in the surface hard-
ness, leading to a reduction in the material removal rate, as
shown in Fig. 4(b).
Following the polishing process, the particles embedded
in the workpiece surface cannot be removed using a post-
processing operation. However, before polishing, the
particles can be clad with a lubricant material such as
water-solvent machining oil (see Section 3.3), which
improves the sliding of the particles across the workpiece
surface, thereby reducing the embedment effect. Further-
more, the addition of an appropriate amount of water-
solvent oil improves the surface roughness considerably
compared to that obtained using a pure water additive,
despite the residual particles which remain in the substrate
surface.
From the discussions above, it is clear that for a constant
abrasive granule diameter, a strong correlation exists
between the surface hardening phenomenon and the
polishing time. Furthermore, it is observed that irrespective
of the initial surface roughness of the EDM-machined
surface, the roughness of the polished surface always
reduces to a stable value as a result of surface hardening
effects.
3.3. Influence of additive type
To investigate the effect of the additive type on the
polishing performance, the original additive (i.e. pure
water) was replaced by a compound additive comprising
pure water and a speciﬁed quantity of water-solvent
machining oil. The characteristics of the machining oil
are summarized in Table 8. The intention of adding the
water-solvent machining oil is to coat the abrasive particles
with a lubricating layer in order to enhance the sliding
abrasive effect, as shown in Fig. 7.
To enable the polishing effects of different additives to
be compared, #2000SiC abrasive particles were mixed with
three different types of additive, namely pure water, a 1:1
mixture of water-solvent machining oil and pure water and

the mobility of the abrasive particles is reduced, thereby
reducing their ability to abrade the surface. Hence, the
compound additive containing a 1:1 mixture of pure water
and water-solvent machining oil has the lowest material
removal rate of the three additives. It is observed that the
material removal rates obtained when polishing is per-
formed using pure water and a 1:2 mixture of water-solvent
machining oil and pure water, respectively, both fall
signiﬁcantly after 90min. As discussed previously, the
recast layer on the EDM surface is removed entirely during
the ﬁrst 20min of the blasting process, and hence the
abrasive particles impact the substrate material directly.
This produces a surface hardening effect as a result of the
superﬁcial embedment of abrasive particle fragments in the
substrate surface and a ball-impact hardening phenomen-
on, respectively. Consequently, the material removal rate
drops signiﬁcantly during the later stages of the polishing
process.
3.4. Influence of abrasive granule diameter
The results presented above have shown that a com-
pound additive comprising a 1:1 mixture of pure water and
water-solvent machining oil delays the onset of surface
hardening and results in a more reﬁned surface quality.
However, even though the surface roughness is reduced to
Ra ¼ 0.19 mm, a mirror-like surface effect is still not
achieved. This is likely because the #2000SiC abrasive
particles used in the experiments above have a large
diameter and therefore achieve only limited success in
removing undulations from the workpiece surface and
reducing the depth of the surface cracks, respectively.
To evaluate the effect of the particle diameter on the
polishing performance, AJP trials were performed using
#2000SiC particles (diameter 7–8 mm) and #8000SiC
particles (diameter 1–2 mm), respectively. Figs. 10(a)
and (b) show that the #8000SiC particles achieve a lower
ﬁnal surface roughness than the #2000SiC particles, but
yield a far slower material removal rate. In the ﬁrst 20min
of polishing, the surface roughness falls to approximately
Ra ¼ 0.28 mm when using the #2000SiC particles due to
their larger diameter. However, after polishing for 90min,
the hardness of the workpiece surface increases as a result
of the ball-impact and superﬁcial particle embedding
effects, and hence the material removal rate falls markedly.
By contrast, the #8000SiC abrasive particles have a smaller
diameter, and hence apply a relatively lower cutting force
to the workpiece surface. Therefore, even though these
particles yield a far lower material removal rate, the surface
roughness falls to a value of Ra ¼ 0.24 mm after polishing
for 60min because the surface hardening effect is delayed.
Following blasting for 150min, the surface roughness
reduces further to Ra ¼ 0.13 mm. This compares to a
surface roughness of Ra ¼ 0.28 mm when polishing is

of the recast layer from the EDM-machined surface.
However, after 90min, the material removal rate obtained
using the Al2O3 particles is signiﬁcantly higher than that
obtained using the SiC particles. This phenomenon arises
because once the hard, brittle recast layer has been
removed from the surface, the shape and hardness proper-
ties of the SiC particles render them more likely to become
embedded in the workpiece surface, thereby increasing the
surface hardness and reducing the material removal rate.
The results presented above suggest that for a given
initial surface roughness and equivalent machining condi-
tions, the polishing effect obtained using SiC abrasive
particles is better than that obtained using Al2O3 granules.
The superior polishing performance of the SiC particles
can be attributed to the following factors: (1) the SiC
granules have a higher hardness (Mohs Hardness 9.5) than
their Al2O3 counterparts (Mohs Hardness 7) and therefore
they have an enhanced cutting capability when applied to
the machining of SKD61 mold steel with a relatively lower
hardness of HRC 20-23 SKD61; and (2) the SiC particles
are characterized by irregular, shape angular surface
features, whereas the Al2O3 granules have a smooth
appearance, and thus the SiC particles have a superior
cutting capability.
3.6. Mirror-like reflection properties of
AJP polished specimens
This section of the paper discusses the mirror-like
reﬂection properties of SKD61mold steel workpieces
with an initial surface roughness of Ra ¼ 1.03 mm
(Rmax: 7.74 mm) following AJP polishing using #2000SiC
and #8000SiC abrasive particles, respectively, suspended in
a compound additive containing a 1:1 solution of pure
water and water-solvent machining oil. The surface
roughness values of the workpieces following polishing
using the #2000SiC and #8000SiC abrasive particles
are found to be 0.19 mm (Rmax: 1.12 mm) and 0.13 mm
(Rmax: 0.90 mm), respectively. In other words, the two
particles obtain broadly similar surface roughness results.
However, comparing Figs. 13(a) and (b), it is evident that a
considerable difference exists in the mirror-like reﬂection
properties of the two polished surfaces. The diameter of
the #2000SiC granules is larger than that of the #8000SiC
particles, and hence the scratch marks produced on the
workpiece surface are both more complex and deeper, as
shown in Figs. 13(c) and (d). Consequently, the EDM-
machined surface polished with the #8000SiC particles has
improved mirror-like reﬂection characteristics.
Figs. 14(a) and (b) illustrate the reﬂection characteristics
of an EDM-machined SKD61 workpiece with an initial
average surface roughness of Ra ¼ 1.03 mm before and after
blasting using #8000SiC particles, respectively. Meanwhile,
Figs. 14(c)–(f) present SEM images and surface proﬁles of
the non-polished and polished workpiece surfaces, respec-
tively. Finally, Figs. 15(a) and (b) present 3-D plots
of the surface proﬁles of the polished and non-polished
workpieces. In general, the results conﬁrm that the use of
#8000SiC abrasive particles enables a perfect mirror-like
reﬂective surface (Ra ¼ 0.13 mm, Rmax ¼ 0.90 mm) to be
obtained from an EDM-machined surface with an initial
surface roughness of Ra ¼ 1.03 mm (Rmax ¼ 7.74 mm).
3.7. Corrosion
As shown in Fig. 4(b), a signiﬁcant reduction in the
material removal rate was observed after 60min when
polishing was performed using SiC particles. To determine
the extent to which this phenomenon was the result of the
embedment of SiC particles in the substrate surface,
corrosion tests were performed using aqua regia acid.
SEM observations were then performed of the corroded
cross-section, as shown in Fig. 16. Comparing the two
images, it is apparent that the AJP process completely
removes the recast layer on the original EDM surface, but
leaves a signiﬁcant number of SiC particles embedded in

the substrate surface. Consequently, it can be concluded
that the reduced material removal rate following 60min of
polishing is the result both of the ball-impact effect and the
SiC embedment effect.
4. Conclusions
This study has performed a series of Taguchi and
experimental investigations to examine the feasibility of
applying the AJP technique with SiC or Al2O3 abrasive
particles and a water additive to polish EDM-machined
SKD61 mold steel workpieces. In general, the present
results support the following conclusions:
(1) The results of the Taguchi design process have shown
that in the AJP process, the gas pressure and impact
angle have the greatest effect on the surface roughness
of the polished surface. Furthermore, the Taguchi trials
have shown that the optimal AJP processing conditions
when polishing EDM-machined SKD61 mold steel
specimens using a pure water additive are as follows: an
abrasive material to additive ratio of 1:2, an impact
angle of 301, a gas pressure of 4 kg/cm2, a nozzle-to-
workpiece height of 10mm, a platform rotational
velocity of 200 rpm, and a platform travel speed of
150mm/s.
(2) For a given abrasive granule diameter, the use of a 1:1
mixture of pure water and water-solvent machining oil
reduces the cutting force applied by the particles to the
workpiece surface and enables a more reﬁned, mirror-
like polished surface to be obtained.
(3) From this research, it was found when abrasives with
the same granule diameters were added with the
additives of water-solvent machining oil, the cutting
force on workpiece surface could be actually appeased
with ﬁner machined surface reached.
(4) An optimal machine-like ﬁnish is obtained using
#8000SiC abrasive particles suspended in a 1:1 ratio
of pure water and solvent machining oil. These
processing conditions reduce the surface roughness
of the EDM-machined SKD61 mold steel specimen
from an initial value of 1.03 mm to a ﬁnal value of
0.13 mm, corresponding to an improvement of approxi-
mately 87%.
(5) In general, the actual degree of surface roughness
improvement obtained in the AJP process depends on
the initial surface roughness of the workpiece, the size,
the shape and the hardness properties of the abrasive
materials, and the composition of the machining ﬂuid.

This study investigates the abrasive jet polishing (AJP) of electro-discharge-machined and
ground SKD61mold steel specimens using #2000, #3000 or #8000SiC particles and compound
additives comprising either pure water, pure water andwater-solventmachining oil, or pure
water and water wax. The results show that when the polishing process is performed using
#2000SiC particles with a pure water and water wax additive, the surface roughness of the
electro-discharge-machined SKD61 surface is reduced from Ra: 1.0m to 0.08m within
90min. Polishing the ground SKD61 surface using #3000SiC particles with pure water and
water wax, the surface roughness is found to reduce from an initial value of Ra=0.36m
to a ﬁnal value of Ra=0.054m within 60min. To improve the polishing performance, a gas
atomization technique is employed to fabricate wax-coated #3000SiC particles. The results
show that when polishing is performed using these wax-coated particles and a compound
additive of pure water and water wax, the roughness of the ground surface is from Ra:
0.36m to 0.049m within 45min. Overall, the results show that the use of wax-coated
abrasive particles reduces the polishing time and achieves an improved surface ﬁnish.

1. Introduction
High-precision molds are invariably fabricated using electri-
cal discharge machining (EDM) and/or grinding techniques.
However, the EDM’s surfaces are characterized by a brittle
recast layer, while the ground surface usually exhibits burr
defects. The recast layer contains many small craters and
microcracks, which not only damage the molded compo-
nent during the mold-off operation, but also reduce the life
expectancy of the mold itself (Takino et al., 2005; Curodeau et
al., 2004). Researchers have proposed a variety of techniques
for stripping the recast layer, including chemical polishing
(CP), electrical polishing (EP), abrasive polishing,magnetic pol-
ishing, and so forth (Andrade et al., 2005; Lee, 2000; Yin and
Shinmura, 2004; Yamaguchi and Shinmura, 2004). However,

while these methods improve the surface ﬁnish considerably,
it is invariably necessary to carry out a cleaning operation
following the dressing process, which inevitably extends the
machining time and increases the machining cost. Further-
more, in the case of abrasive polishing, recycling the abrasive
particles and polishing liquid following the machining opera-
tion is a time-consuming and expensive process.
Compared to traditional abrasive polishing techniques, the
wet abrasive jet polishing (AJP) technique (Balasubrama et
al., 2002) has a lower abrasive consumption and enables the
abrasive particles and polishing ﬂuid to be more easily recy-
cled. Previous researchers have investigated a variety of topics
in the AJP ﬁeld, including suitable sacriﬁcial layer materials,
high-resolution AJP techniques, the use of AJP to fabricate
matrix oriﬁces in micro-components, and so on (Wensink et

a The predicted surface roughness reduction ratio, R, is 0.629.
The initial experiments compared the polishing perfor-
mance obtained using a pure water additive and a compound
additive of pure water and machining oil, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 5, the aim of adding the machining oil to the
water was to improve the polishing performance of the SiC
particles by enhancing their sliding/grinding effect. Fig. 6(a)
shows that after 20min of polishing using the purewater addi-
tive, the surface roughness of the SKD61 workpiece reduced
from Ra=1.0m to 0.27–0.29m. This result is notably bet-
ter than that achieved by either of the additives containing
machiningoil.Whenmachiningoilwas added to thewater in a
1:1 ratio, the surface roughness reduced to around Ra: 0.19m
after 120min. This represents a surface roughness improve-
ment of 80%, and is around 0.11m lower than that achieved
using pure water after the same polishing time. However, it
can be seen that the compoundadditive containing purewater
and machining oil in the ratio of 2:1 yielded a relatively poor
polishing performance (see also the SEM images in Fig. 7). This
result arises because for a constant gas pressure, the relatively
higher proportion of water to machining oil reduces the adhe-
sion force bonding the oil to the particles and hence limits
their ability to slide across the workpiece surface.

Fig. 6(b) shows that irrespective of the amount of machin-
ing oil added to the pure water-solvent, the material removal
rate is signiﬁcantly lower than that achieved using pure water
only. This suggests that the addition of machining oil reduces
the cutting force applied to the workpiece surface by the abra-
sive particles. This is beneﬁcial from a polishing point of view
since it not only reduces the depth of the scratches produced
on the workpiece surface during the blasting process, but also
delays the onset of the surface hardening effectwith the result
that an improved surface quality can be obtained. Fig. 6(b)
also shows that the material removal rates of the pure water
additive and the compound additive comprising a 2:1 mixture
of water and machining oil both fall signiﬁcantly following
90min of machining. This result arises because the recast
layer on the EDM-machined surface is completely removed
during the ﬁrst 20min of the polishing process, and hence the
abrasive particles impact directly on the substrate thereafter.
This results in a ball-impact type hardening effect of the sub-
strate surface. The surface hardness is further increased by
the embedment of high-hardness, abrasiveparticle fragments.
As a result, the machining capabilities of the abrasive parti-
cles are reduced, and hence the material removal rate falls
signiﬁcantly.
Polishing experiments were then performed using
#2000SiC particles and compound additives comprising
pure water and water wax mixed in various ratios (see
Table 7). Fig. 8 shows that when the compound additive has a

highwater wax content relative to that of the SiC particles and
pure water, the cutting force applied to the specimen surface
is reduced, and thus the surface roughness improvement is
diminished. Overall, it can be seen that the additive with a
500:1000:1500 (water wax:SiC:water) composition yields the
best polishing performance. From inspection, it is found that
the surface roughness of the EDM-machined SKD61 mold
steel specimen is reduced from an initial value of 1.03m to a
ﬁnal value of Ra=0.08m after 90min. Comparing the results
presented in Fig. 8 with those presented in Fig. 6 for the
compound additive containing machining oil, it is apparent
that the addition of water wax reduces the cutting force and
increases the sliding grinding efﬁciency, thereby resulting in
a much improved surface quality.
3.2.2. Effect of particle size
To investigate the effect of the particle diameter on the pol-
ishing performance, trials were performed using #2000SiC
particles (diameter: 7.1–8.9m) and #3000SiC particles (diam-
eter: 4.7–5.9m), respectively. The polishing trials were
performed using SKD61 specimens with an initial surface
roughness of Ra=1.03m and a compound additive compris-
ing water wax, SiC particles and pure water mixed in a ratio
of 500:1000:1500. Fig. 9 shows that the #2000SiC abrasive parti-
cles achieve a better surface roughness improvement than the
#3000SiC particles. This result ismost reasonably attributed to
the larger diameter of the #2000SiC particles, which increases
the cutting force developed by the particles upon impact and
therefore enhances the material removal rate.
3.2.3. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) compositional
analysis and corrosion analysis
Energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses were performed
of the surfaces of an electro-discharge-machined SKD61
specimen with a surface roughness of Ra=1.0m and an AJP-
polished SKD61 specimen with a surface roughness of Ra:
0.19m. The corresponding results are presented in Table 8
and reveal that the Si content of the AJP-processed surface
(1.84%) is higher than that of the EDM-machined surface
Fig. 9 – Inﬂuence of Si abrasive particle diameter on
polished surface roughness.
(1.40%). This result can be attributed to the embedding of SiC
particles in the substrate surface following the removal of the
recast layer. Fig. 10 presents Si mapping diagrams and SEM
images of the two surfaces. Overall, the results reveal that
the AJP operation not only increases the Si content of the
workpiece surface, but also improves the uniformity of the
Si distribution.
To clarify the reduction in the material removal rate
observed after 90min of polishing (see Fig. 6(b)), corrosion
tests were performed using an aqua regia corrosive liquid
and SEM images were then acquired of the transverse sec-
tion, as shown in Fig. 11. Comparing the two images, it can
be seen that the recast layer is completely removed following
the AJP process. Furthermore, it is apparent that SiC parti-
cles become embedded in the workpiece surface following
the polishing operation. Therefore, the results indicate that
in addition to the surface hardening phenomenon caused by
the ball-impact effect, themajor cause for the reduction in the
material removal rate during the later stages of the polishing
operation is the embedment of SiC abrasive fragments in the
surface of the substrate material.

3.3. Effect of additive type and particle size on
characteristics of polished ground SKD61 surface
3.3.1. Effect of additive ratio
Polishing experiments were performed using ground SKD61
mold steel specimens with an initial surface roughness of Ra:
0.36m and #3000SiC particles mixed with compound addi-
tives of water and water wax mixed in various proportions.
Fig. 12 shows that when the water wax content of the additive
is very low compared to that of the pure water (i.e. 250:1750), a
poor surface roughness occurs since the water wax is stripped
from the particles under the inﬂuence of the supply pressure.
As a result, the sliding/grinding effect of the abrasive parti-
cles is reduced, and thus a higher total surface roughness is
obtained. It can be seen that the best polishing performance
is obtained using the compound additive mixed in a ratio
of 500:1000:1500 (water wax:SiC particles:pure water). From
inspection, it is found that when polishing is performed using
this additive, the surface roughness of the ground specimen is
reduced froman initial value of Ra: 0.36–0.054mafter 60min.
3.3.2. Effect of particle diameter
Polishing trials were performed using ground SKD61 speci-
mens with an initial surface roughness of Ra: 0.36m and
particles with three different grit sizes, namely #2000SiC
(diameter: 7.1–8.9m), #3000SiC (diameter: 4.7–5.9m) and
#8000SiC (diameter: 1–2m). In every case, the particles
were mixed with water wax and pure water in a ratio of
500:1000:1500 (water wax:SiC particles:pure water). Fig. 13
shows that after 60min, the surface roughness achieved using
the #3000SiC abrasive particles (Ra=0.054m) is signiﬁcantly
lower than that achieved using the #2000SiC or #8000SiC abra-
sives. Of the three abrasives, the #8000SiC particles have the
smallest diameter, and hence generate a lower cutting force.
Conversely, the #2000SiC particles have the largest diame-
ter, and thus develop the greatest cutting force. Hence, their
impact on the workpiece surface generates deep scratch
marks, resulting in a higher surface roughness.
Fig. 13 – Inﬂuence of abrasive particle diameter on polished
surface roughness.
3.3.3. Polishing characteristics of wax-coated sic particles
Polishing experiments were conducted using wax-coated
#3000SiC particles and ground SKD61 mold steel specimens
with an initial surface roughness of Ra=0.36m. Polishing tri-
als were also performed using uncoated #2000SiC, #3000SiC
and #8000SiC particles for comparison purposes. In every case,
the abrasives were mixed with water wax and pure water in
the ratio 500:1000:1500 (water wax:SiC particles:water). Fig. 14
shows that thewax-coated particles reduce the surface rough-
ness to a value of Ra=0.049m after 45min. This result is
better than that obtained using the uncoated #3000SiC abra-
sives (Ra=0.054m; 60min) and ismost reasonably attributed
to the enhanced sliding/grinding effect induced by the wax
lubrication layer on the abrasive particles. Fig. 15 shows that
thematerial removal rate of thewax-coated #3000SiC particles
is signiﬁcantly lower than that of the uncoated #3000SiC par-
ticles. Hence, it can be inferred that the wax layer reduces the
cutting force applied by the particles on theworkpiece surface.
It can also be seen that the surface hardening phenomenon
caused by the ball-impact effect and the embedment of par-

hardness falls to a value of HRC 27.9. However, this value
is still considerably higher than that of the original SKD61

Abstract This study performs experimental investigation
into the application of abrasive jet polishing (AJP) to the
surface finishing of electrical-discharge-machined SKD61
mold steel workpieces. The results indicate that the AJP
processing conditions which optimize the surface quality of
the SKD61 workpiece when polishing using #2000SiC
abrasives are as follows: an abrasive material to additive ratio
of 1:2, an impact angle of 30°, a gas pressure of 4 kg/cm2
(0.4 MPa), a nozzle-to-workpiece height of 10 mm, a
platform rotational velocity of 200 rpm, and a platform
travel speed of 150 mm/s. Under these processing con-
ditions, a polishing time of 20 min is sufficient to reduce the
surface roughness from an initial value of Ra=1.7 μm to a
final value of Ra=0.27 μm, corresponding to an improve-
ment of 84.12%. The experimental results demonstrate that
the maximum attainable improvement in the surface quality
of the polished workpiece is limited by a surface-hardening
effect caused by the ball-impact phenomenon and the
embedment of #2000SiC fragments in the workpiece surface.

1 Introduction
Precision molds are generally fabricated using an electrical
discharge machining (EDM) technique. However, the recast
layer formed on the machined surface has a poor surface
quality, characterized by a large number of craters and
microcracks [1, 2]. These surface defects tend to result in
the formation of scratches in the product during the mold-
off operation and reduce the life expectancy of the mold.
Therefore, a requirement exists to develop effective means
for removing the recast layer from the machined surface.
Previous researchers have attempted to meet this require-
ment by optimizing the discharge parameters, electrode,
and introducing additives into the machining fluid [3–7].
These abovementioned methods enhance the machining
efficiency and significantly reduce the surface roughness,
but the traces of the recast layer still remain on the
underlying substrate. In an attempt to improve the quality
of the polished surface, various nonconventional polishing
techniques have been proposed, including chemical polish-
ing, electropolishing [8, 9], abrasive flow polishing [10–12],
and magnetic force polishing [13, 14]. Although these
methods improve the surface precision, they may result in
environmental pollution or inadvertent damage to the
workpiece surface. Furthermore, it is generally necessary

3 Results and discussions
3.1 System performance and machining characteristic
analysis
To find out the influence for system performance to affect
AJP parameters within the shortest time, firstly conduct the
performance exploration on the AJP for the convenience of
parameter design within the experiment production proce-
dures and establishment available for the mechanism of
production research.
3.1.1 Pressure variance
In the current research, the relationship between the actual
outlet pressure and the pressure setting value is defined as
follows
Useful rate of pressure
¼ Outlet pressure Pressure setting value= Þ  100%ð
ð2Þ
Figure 3a shows that the variation of the nozzle-to-
workpiece height between 10 and 20 mm has no significant
effect on the outlet pressure. In theory, the addition of
abrasive material introduces a friction effect at the tube
walls and should therefore reduce the outlet pressure.
However, in practice, the abrasive granules are driven by
a high-pressure jet in order to enhance the machining
efficiency. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3a, the outlet
pressure actually increases slightly when abrasive granules
are added to the gas supply.
Figure 3b–d illustrates the correlations between the
outlet pressure and the gas pressure, impact angle, and
abrasive ANSI mesh(#), respectively. In general, the
correlation is approximately linear. The front impact force
is increased as a result of the increment of gas pressure or
impact angles approximate to 90° and decreasing granule
diameter of abrasive material also causes the larger gravity;
therefore, the useful rate of pressure increases accordingly.

3.1.4 Abrasive to additive mixture ratio
Polishing experiments were performed using #2000SiC
abrasive granules mixed in an aqueous solution in ratios of
1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 (abrasive to water), respectively. The
abrasive were mixed into the water by mechanical stirrers
rotating at 200 rpm. The mixture was stirred continuously
for 30 min to ensure a thorough mixing effect. Figure 6b
illustrates the rate of surface roughness improvement
obtained using the three different abrasive–water solutions.
It is observed that the best polishing results are obtained
when the abrasive is mixed with water in a ratio of 1:2.
Under these conditions, the solution contains particles
mixed with water in a ratio of 1:2, for a given processing
time and area; the workpiece surface is impacted by high
proportion of abrasives, and hence both the rate of surface
roughness improvement and the material removal rate
increase. Conversely, when the proportion of abrasive
particles in the water solution is reduced, both the rate of
surface roughness improvement and the material removal
rate also reduce. The rate of improvement in the surface
roughness and the material removal rate are governed not
only by the number of particle impacts but also by the
impact force since clearly a particle impacting with a higher
force has a greater cutting capability. In the case where the
particles are mixed with the water solution in a ratio of 1:2,
the particles have a higher kinetic energy since, as a result,
the abrasive with water in 1:2 have a better cutting
capability than those mixed in ratios of 1:3 and 1:4,
respectively, and consequently both the rate of surface
roughness improvement and the material removal weight
are improved.
3.1.5 Impact angle
Figure 6c shows that an impact angle of 30° yields a higher
rate of surface roughness improvement (46.50%) than
impact angles of either 45° (38.5%) or 60° (35.5%). This
result arises because the particles impacting the workpiece
surface at a lower angle of incidence impact the small
protruding parts of the workpiece surface at a high speed by
impact angle of 30° in a glimpse moment. The removal can

than that removed at an impact angle of 45° (59.3 mg).
However, as the impact angle is increased further to 60°,
the removal weight reduces significantly to approximately
29 mg. The reduced material removal weight is a
consequence of the ball-impact effect at higher values of
the impact angle and the embedment of SiC particles in the
workpiece surface. Both phenomena lead to a hardening of
the workpiece surface and therefore result in a reduction in
the cutting capabilities of the particles.
Overall, the results presented in Fig. 6c indicate that the
AJP process may produce either a sliding grinding action or
a superficial particle embedding effect depending on the
impact angle. Figure 6c implies that an impact angle of 45°
represents the transition point between the two different
regimes. As shown in Fig. 6d, at lower impact angles, the
sliding grinding effect is more pronounced than the embed-
ding effect, while at higher impact angles, the embedding
effect is greater than the sliding grinding effect. Consequent-
ly, it can be inferred that a lower impact angle yields a
smoother, more refined polished surface, while a higher
impact angle produces a rougher surface.
3.1.6 Gas pressure
Figure 6e shows that the rate of surface roughness
improvement increases with an increasing gas pressure over
the range from 1 to 4 kg/cm2 and attains a peak value of
46.50%. However, when the gas pressure is increased further
to 5 kg/cm2, the rate of surface roughness improvement falls
slightly. The current experiments are performed using a
round nozzle with an aperture of 4 mm, which permits the
unrestricted flow of air at rates of 1∼4 kg/cm2. When the gas
pressure is increased to 5 kg/cm2, not all of the gas is able to
exit the nozzle. The gas which cannot pass through the
nozzle is returned to the air compressor pipelines causing a
deficient siphon phenomena. As a result, the kinetic energy
of the ejected abrasive particles falls slightly and hence their
ability to remove material from the workpiece surface also
falls. In Fig. 6e, the variation in the weight of the material
removed tracks that of the rate of surface roughness
improvement, i.e., it increases as the gas pressure is
increased from 1 to 4 kg/cm2 but then reduces as the gas
pressure is increased further to 5 kg/cm2.
3.1.7 Standoff distance
Figure 6f shows that both the rate of improvement of the
surface roughness and the material removal rate decrease as
the processing height are increased. This is primarily
because, for a constant gas pressure, the kinetic energy of
the particles impacting the workpiece surface decreases as
the processing height increases, and hence the cutting
capability of the particles reduces. About the improving rate
on surface roughness, it can be clearly seen that the optimal
improving rate on surface is 46.5%, when the processing
height is leveled at 10 mm. About the removal volume of
material, when the processing height is leveled at 10 mm,
the removal volume of material is 45 mg. Also, with the
increment of processing height, the removal volume of
material will be reversely reduced. Thus, it can be testified
that the processing height leveled at 10 mm can result in the
optimal improving rate on surface.
3.1.8 Platform rotational velocity
Figure 6g shows that, when the platform rotates with a
velocity of 50∼200 rpm, the rate of surface roughness
improvement remains approximately constant at around
46%. However, when the velocity is increased to 700 rpm,
the rate of surface roughness improvement falls slightly to
39%. This reduction occurs because the particles are ejected
from the workpiece surface almost immediately following
impact when the platform rotates more rapidly, and hence
the sliding grinding effect is suppressed. Furthermore, when
the processing is carried out immediately after the rotary
speed of the platform has been zeroed, it will easily cause
inferior uniformity on processed surface. Therefore, a
platform rotational speed of 50∼200 rpm not only achieves
an effective improvement in the sliding grinding effect but
also solves the deformity of the processed surface.
Figure 6g shows that, irrespective of the rotational speed
of the platform, the weight of material removed remains
constant at between 25 and 35 mg. Overall, the results
presented in Fig. 6g suggest that a rotational speed of
200 rpm represents the optimal setting when performing the
AJP processing of SKD61 mold steel workpieces.
3.1.9 Platform travel speed
Figure 6h shows that variances in the platform travel speed
in the range 50∼250 mm/s results in no more than a slight
variation in the rate of surface roughness improvement.
However, from a close inspection, it is observed that the
rate of surface roughness improvement obtains its maxi-
mum value of approximately 47% at a travel speed of
150 mm/s. In other words, a platform travel speed of
150 mm/s represents the optimal setting in the current AJP
process.
Summarizing the results presented in Fig. 6, it can be
concluded that the optimal AJP process parameters for
enhancing the rate of surface roughness improvement and
the material removal rate when using #2000SiC abrasive
particles are as follows: an abrasive material to additive ratio
of 1:2, an impact angle of 30°, a gas pressure of 4 kg/cm2, a
nozzle-to-workpiece height of 10 mm, a platform rotational
velocity of 200 rpm, and a platform travel speed of 150 mm/s.
Int J Adv Manuf Technol
significantly hardened as a result of the embedded
#2000SiC particles. Therefore, the material removal rate
falls significantly, as shown in Figs. 8b and 10c.
3.3 Analysis of surface characteristics
This section investigates the SiC contents of the polished
SKD61 workpiece surface following AJP processing using
#8000SiC granules. In the investigation, quantitative and
mapping analyses were performed of the surfaces of an
unmachined SKD61 specimen, an ED-machined SKD61
specimen (Ra=1.0 μm), and an abrasive jet (AJ)-polished
ED-machined SKD61 specimen (Ra 0.13 μm). As shown in
Table 3, the Si content of the workpiece surface following
the AJP process (i.e., 1.84%) is higher than that of either
the original SKD61 substrate (1.21%) or the ED-machined
substrate (1.4%). In other words, the superficial embedding
effect of the SiC particles during the polishing operation
results in a significant increase in the Si contents of the
substrate surface. Figure 11 presents SEM images and the
corresponding mapping profiles of the Si content distribu-
tion of the ED-machined surface (Ra=1.0 μm) and the AJ-
polished surface (Ra=0.13 μm). The results confirm that
the AJP operation not only increases the Si content of the
workpiece surface but also improves the uniformity of the
Si distribution.

4 Conclusions
This study has performed an experimental investigation into
the surface finishing of ED-machined SKD61 mold steel
workpieces using the AJP process with #2000SiC abrasive
particles. The present experimental results support the
following conclusions:
1. The use of an aqueous solution with the same particle
diameter during the AJP process reduces the cutting
force applied to the workpiece surface and results in
improved polishing performance.
2. When applying the AJP process to polish SKD61 mold
steel with #2000SiC abrasive particles, the optimal
