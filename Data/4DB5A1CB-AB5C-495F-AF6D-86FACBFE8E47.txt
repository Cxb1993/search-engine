respectively. The improvement increases significantly when 
the variation is high. Static variation can be unfair to the 
nodes assigned a lower transmit probability. To ensure 
fairness among participating nodes, we adopt a dynamic 
variation scheme that maps the transmit probabilities into a 
Latin square where an NN  table filled with N  
different symbols in such a way that each symbol occurs 
exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. 
For example, a Latin square of dimension 3 is as follows.

We may assign 1/6. 2/3, and 1/2  to 1x , 2x , and, 3x , 
respectively. Each node transmits according to a column of a 
Latin square. For example, node 1, assigned column 1 
transmits with probabilities 1/6, 2/3, and 1/2, in time slots 1, 2, 
and 3, respectively. Node 2 transmits with probabilities 2/3, 
1/2, and 1/6, respectively. Node 3 transmits with probabilities 
1/2, 1/6, and 2/3, respectively. The average transmit 
probability is constant among rows and columns to ensure 
maximal throughput of the channel and fairness among 
triggered sensor nodes. 
We propose a scheme to increase the throughput of 
slotted Aloha for single hop wireless sensor networks. The 
proposed variable transmit probability scheme based on Latin 
square not only increases the throughput but also guarantees 
fairness among triggered sensor nodes. The preliminary 
performance results have shown that the proposed variable 
transmit probability scheme can improve the throughput 
significantly when the number of nodes is relatively small. 
Variable Transmit Probability with intermixed Grouping 
In Part I, we introduce the concept of variable transmit 
probability and compare the performance gain of the 
proposed scheme. As the dimension increase (number of 
nodes) the variability decreases and thus the improvement of 
the variable transmit probability diminishes. On way to solve 
this problem is through grouping, that is, dividing the entire 
triggered nodes into groups. In the last year proposal, we have 
introduced the idea of grouping and show that there are many 
advantages of using grouping. Here we will apply the idea of 
using variable transmit probability scheme on top of the fixed 
grouping and the intermixed grouping (based on the theory of 
finite projective plane). In other words, we first divide the 
N  sensor nodes into groups, and then we apply the idea of 
variable transmit probability scheme to each of the N  
groups. Thus we can obtain the advantages of both 
inter-mixed grouping and the variable transmit probability. 
Before we move on to show how the variable transmit 
probability for the grouping, we briefly introduce the 
intermixed grouping. 
Intermixed grouping  
We consider intermixed grouping of sensor nodes using finite 
projective plane for a single hop wireless sensor networks. 
The differences between the proposed finite projective plane 
scheme and the conventional slotted Aloha are as follows. 
First, A transmitting sensor node in standard model transmits 
with a probability   in each of the time slots corresponding 
to the points of a set of the finite projective plane, where   
is between 0 and 1.  When the number of triggered sensor 
nodes increases,   is reduced to lower the probability of 
collisions. Secondly, in the proposed scheme, we divide the 
sensor nodes into groups based on the theory of finite 
projective plane, where each group transmits messages in a 
round-robin fashion. On top of that, if the percentage of active 
nodes is very high, the mode of multiple access scheme can 
be switched into the polling mode. Lastly, in the proposed 
approach, in the context wireless sensor networks, we are 
interested in both the energy cost, passage time (time delay of 
the event-driven process). 
In contrast to the intermixed grouping, the fixed 
grouping method is a rather generic scheme for selecting time 
slots for sensor nodes to transmit. For instance, a time frame 
of 30 time slots is shared by 30 sensor nodes (numbered 1 
through 30). Each sensor nodes select a number of time slots 
among the 30 time slots within the time frame. Suppose that 
each sensor node is allowed to transmit triggered message for

Intermixed Grouping with Variable Transmit Probability 
Scheme 
We describe how to  apply variable transmit 
probability scheme to the grouping as follows. For the fixed 
grouping, we first divide the N  nodes into Groups and then 
apply the variable transmit probability scheme to each of the 
N  groups. For example in the thirteen nodes, 1 through 
12, the four groups are (1,2,3), (4,5,6), (7,8,9),(10,11,12), we 
then assign a Latin square of dimension three to each of the 
four groups. 
For inter-mixed grouping, such as based on a Latin 
square, no change is required to the assignment of columns of 
Latin square. The only difference is that a node only transmits 
at the time slots corresponding to the points of a set of the 
finite projective plane. Since fewer nodes are competing at 
each time slots, the transmit probability need to be increased. 
We will illustrate this point using example in the next section. 
  
2. Variable Transmit Probability for Grouped Slotted 
ALOHA 
We have shown in PART I that the variable transmit 
probability is useful especially when the variability in 
transmit probabilities among nodes is high. In other words, 
the greater the variability, the higher the performance gain of 
the variable transmit probability scheme. However, as we note 
that when the number of sensor nodes increases, the 
variability among the transmit probabilities decreases. For 
example, the variability of transmit probabilities (0, 0.5, 1) is 
greater than that of the transmit probabilities (0, 0.25, 0.5, 
0.75,1). One way to reduce the size of competing nodes is 
through grouping. The variable transmit probabilities scheme 
can be applied to both fixed grouping and dynamic grouping 
using finite projective plane.  
As stated in last year proposal, the main reason of 
using finite projective plane is as follows. In general, the 
transmitting probability is inversely proportional to the 
number of active sensor nodes to achieve minimal expected 
time delay. However, the number of active nodes is not evenly 
distributed among the groups with the fixed grouping. Since 
we are not able to determine the percentage of active nodes in 
each group, the transmitting probability of an active node is 
determined globally, that is, based on estimating the total 
number of active sensor nodes, resulting in an 
inhomogeneous distribution of active sensor nodes among 
groups. Thus some of the groups have higher percentage of 
active sensor nodes. Using the transmitting probability 
determined globally may result in longer expected time delay 
in each case. In certain cases, starvation of some active sensor 
nodes may occur. Using the intermixed grouping, the 
starvation problem and low throughput can be fixed due to the 
fact that an active node is competing with different nodes in 
each of the consecutive slots. 
In addition, a mal-functioned sensor node may transmit 
signals in consecutive time slots. Using fixed grouping, a 
normal active sensor may be blocked indefinitely assuming 
single reception capability of the sink node. 
We now describe how the variable transmit probability 
scheme can be applied to the grouped ALOHA. 
Variable transmit probability for fixed grouping. 
This idea is simple to implement. For example, we consider 
the case that nine nodes are competing for the channel using 
slotted ALOHA. Based on a Latin square of dimension 9, the 
transmit probability assignment without grouping can be as 
follows. 
Note that the transmit probability of a cell in the matrix 
is determined by the number in a cell divided by the sum of 
the numbers. As a comparison, Table 3 shows an example of 
variable transmit probability with no grouping. The transmit 
probability varies from cell to cell. The transmit probability of 
a cell is calculated by the number of a cell divided by the sum 
of a Latin square of dimension 9.

As noted in the above example, the intermixed 
grouping and be combined with the variable transmit 
probabilities to enjoy the benefits of both schemes. We will 
provide detailed numeric results and theoretical analysis. 
3. Performance evaluation 
In the performance evaluation, we assume that there are 
12  nN  sensor nodes  triggered by an event. A 
throughput comparison is made between homogeneous 
transmit probability scheme and variable transmit probability 
scheme based on Latin square. In the homogeneous transmit 
probability scheme the probability that a triggered node 
transmits successfully is equal to 
n2)1(   . Since all the 
12 n  nodes transmit with identical probability, the 
throughput of a time slot of the homogeneous transmit 
probability, hT ,  is as follows.

With the variable transmit probability scheme. The transmit 
probabilities for the 12 n  nodes for the first time slot are 
assigned according to the first row of a Latin square denoted 
as,  i , where nin  . The transmit 
probabilities are  n ,  )1(  n ,…,  , …, 
 )1(  n ,  n , as shown in Table 3. The 
average transmit probability is equal to,  , identical to the 
homogeneous transmit probability scheme. The value   
can be adjusted to reflect the amount of variability of transmit 
probabilities among nodes. The larger the value of   is, the 
greater the variability is. Each node then transmits according 
to the Latin square of  the size 12 n .  
The throughput of variable transmit probability scheme 
is then calculated as follows. First, the probability of a 
successful transmission of the node assigned the transmit 
probability  i  is equal to the probability that it 
transmits and all other nodes withhold, that is,

time slot of the variable transmit probability, vT , is equal to

One may notice that (1) is a special case of (2) by setting 
0 .We compute the throughput of a time slot for both 
the homogeneous transmit-probability scheme and the 
variable transmit-probability scheme for various values of 
N , where 12  nN .  
 Figure 1 shows the throughputs computed based on (1) 
and (2) for various numbers of sensor nodes. The variability 
  is set to be n/2  and n/ . The variable transmit 
probability scheme shows a significant improvement in 
comparison to the homogeneous transmit probability scheme 
when the number of the sensor nodes is small. As the number 
of nodes increases, the variation of transmit probabilities gets 
even smaller, and thus, the improvement of the throughput 
diminishes. We also notice the impact of the selection of  . 
The greater the value of  , the better the throughput if the 
transmit probability of each sensor node is  greater than zero 
as is the case

continues to increase, as is the case
