Multiple scattering of flexural waves in an infinite thin plate with multiple 
circular (elliptical) holes or inclusions by using the boundary method 
Abstract 
In this project, the multipole method is employed to analytically solve the problem of multiple 
scattering of flexural wave by multiple circular holes or inclusions in an infinite thin plate subject to 
an incident flexural wave. The near-field dynamic moment concentration factor (DMCF) and the 
far-field scattering pattern are both investigated to study their influence on plate structures. The 
former has a connection with the fatigue failures and the damages in plate-like structures can be 
detected by the latter. Owing to the addition theorem, the multipole expansion for the multiple 
scattering fields can be transformed into the expression with respect to a single coordinate system, 
centered at one circle along the boundary of which continuity conditions are required. In this way, a 
coupled infinite linear algebraic system is derived as an analytical model for an infinite thin plate 
with multiple circular holes or inclusions subject to the incident flexural wave. The infinite system 
should be truncated to a finite system to evaluate the numerical results. The convergence analysis is 
conducted to provide the guideline of usage for the proposed method by using different terms of the 
multipole expansion. The effects of the size and thickness of the flexible inclusion, and the central 
distance between inclusions on the near-field DMCF and the far-field scattering pattern are 
investigated in the numerical examples, where the cases of one and two inclusions are considered. It 
shows that the scattering pattern correlates closely with the size and thickness of damages, indicating 
the importance of the scattering pattern to detect the various damages. In addition, the DMCF of two 
corrosion damages is larger than that of one, when the space between damages is small and 
meanwhile the flexural wave with a specified incident direction impinges on the plate. Therefore, it 
is essential to evaluate structural safety when multiple circular defects are very close to each other. 
Besides, the effect of the space between the inclusions on the near-field DMCF is different from that 
on the far-field scattering pattern.

analytical model for the title problem. Finally some numerical results are presented in the truncated finite 
system. Once the displacement fields of each inclusion and the surrounding plate are solved, the near-field 
DMCF and the far-field scattering pattern can be determined in a theoretical way. The effects of the size 
and thickness of the flexible inclusion, and the space between inclusions on the near-field DMCF and the 
far-field scattering pattern, respectively, are examined in this paper.  
2. Problem statement and the general solution 
An infinite thin plate containing H circular inclusions with different thickness from the surrounding 
plate, subjected to the incident flexural wave is shown in Fig. 1, where H+1 observer coordinate systems 
are used: (x1, x2) are the global plane Cartesian coordinates centered at O, ( , )p pρ φ , p=1,…,H are local 
plane polar coordinates centered at Op, Rp denotes the radius of the pth circular inclusion, hp and Bp are its 
corresponding boundary and thickness.  
When considering the time-harmonic motion exclusively, the governing equation of the flexural wave 
for a uniform infinite thin plate with distributed circular inclusions as shown in Fig. 1 is written as follows: 
4 4( ) ( ) 0, ew k w               Ω ,x x x∇ − = ∈  (1)
where 4∇  is the biharmonic operator, w(x) is the out-of-plane elastic displacement and x is the field point, 
eΩ  is the unbounded exterior region occupied by the infinite plate, 4 2 0 /k ω ρ h D= , k ( 2π /wave length) is 
the wave number of elastic wave, ω  is the circular frequency, 0ρ  is the volume density, 
3 2D Eh /12(1-μ )= is the flexural rigidity, E  denotes the Young’s modulus, μ  is the Poisson’s ratio and  
h0 is the plate thickness. 
The solution of the BiHelmholtz equation, Eq. (1), in the plane polar coordinates can be represented as 
( , ) ( ) imm

1 2 3 4( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )m m m m m m m m mw c J k c Y k c I k c K kρ ρ ρ ρ ρ= + + + , (3) 
in which imc  (i=1-4) are the coefficients, Jm and Ym are the mth order Bessel functions; and Im and Km are 
the mth order modified Bessel functions. Based on the characteristics of functions at ρ =0 and ρ→∞, the 
appropriate Bessel function and the modified Bessel function are chosen to represent the transverse 
displacement field for the infinite plate and finite inclusion. 
When harmonic forces are applied perpendicularly to a thin plate and they are far enough from the 
inclusions, an incident flexural wave with an incident wave number k and angle α  with respect to the x1 
axis can be represented by

To determine these unknown coefficients, the other three Eqs. (15)-(17) are required by applying three 
operators of Eqs. (7), (8) and (10) to Eq. (18). Not only does this procedure involve the higher order 
derivatives, Eq. (18) also involves multi-variables. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the unknown 
coefficients by using the procedure mentioned above. This problem can be solved by using the addition 
theorem [12] which can convert multi-variables into one variable so that the higher order derivatives can 
be easily determined.

3.2 Scattered far-field amplitude 
For the most part of scattering applications, it is interesting to measure the scattered field far away from 
the scatterer. On the other hand, the asymptotic behavior or uniqueness of fundamental solutions is an 
important issue for the numerical computation. Therefore, we examine the behavior of the scattered 
response in the far field. The scattered far-field amplitude ( )f φ [5] is defined as 
( )( ) lim 2 ( )scf wρφ ρ→∞= ⋅ x . (43)
In this paper, the radius of the field point is taken as 90m because ( )f φ  converges a steady value when 
this radius is more than about 90m.  
4 Numerical results and discussions 
To demonstrate the theoretical formulation in the previous section, the FORTRAN code was 
implemented to solve the flexural wave scattered by multiple circular inclusions in an infinite thin plate. 
The near-field DMCF as well as the far-field scattering amplitude is numerically determined in the 
truncated finite system from Eq. (38). In all cases, the thickness of plate h0 is 0.002m unless otherwise 
specified. The following dimensionless variables are utilized in the next computation: the incident wave 
number is ka, the space between inclusions is L/a and the thickness of flexible inclusion is h/h0, where a is 
the radius of a circular inclusion and L is the central distance between inclusions. For the special case of a 
hole, it can be modeled by reducing the value of  h/h0 to be 0.0005 in the numerical simulation.  
Case 1: An infinite plate with one circular inclusion 
An infinite plate with one circular flexible inclusion of radius a subject to the incident flexural wave 
with 0α =  was firstly considered. Considering a flexible inclusion with h/h0=0.5, Fig. 2 shows the 
DMCF on the circular boundary, at / 2π , versus the dimensionless wave number by using different 
 10
those provided by the BIEM [9] in which thirty terms of Fourier series are used. Compared with the 
convergence analysis in [9], the fictitious frequency appearing in the BIEM [9] does not appear in the 
present formulation. During the convergence analysis, the maximum of the allowable truncated number M 
is limited by the minimum value of ka concerned, for instance here ka=0.1. The reason for this is that the 
Bessel functions of ( )m pY kR  and ( )m pI kR  of Eq. (38) become large when k is small. Actually, the 
truncated number M can be increased while the concerned minimum value of ka increases. When the 
value of L/a increases to 4.0 as shown in Fig. 12, the rate of convergence becomes faster and the required 
truncated number M can be reduced, where twenty terms of Fourier series in the BIEM are used for 
comparison. 
The corresponding convergence analysis for the far-field scattering amplitude is shown in Figs. 13 and 
14, where twenty terms of Fourier series in the BIEM are used for comparison. It indicates that the 
required number of M is unrelated to the value of L/a. In addition, it can be seen that the convergence rate 
of the far-field is faster than that of the near field. The complicated calculation for the near-field DMCF 
can account for this fact. In summary, for the near-field DMCF, when the value of L/a is small, the 
required number of M mainly depends on the considered minimum dimensionless central distance L/a. 
When the value of L/a is large (such as 4.0 or 10.0) or one inclusion is considered, the value of M can be 
reduced and depends on the value of ka of the incident wave. Through the numerical experiments, it is 
found that the required number of M can be taken from 20 to 8 for the minimum separation distance L/a 
ranged from 2.1 to 10.0. As regards the far field, taking M=8 or 10 can make results accurate enough. 
For the case of L/a = 2.1, Figs. 15-17 show the distribution of DMCF along the circular boundary of the 
upper flexible inclusion when the different size of a circular damage (ka=0.5, 1.0 and 3.0) and the 
different corrosion-induced thinning (h/h0=0.0005, 0.5 and 0.75) were considered. It is observed that the 
distribution of DMCF of two circular inclusions is different from that of one, where the maximum of 
DMCF increases nearly three times since the two inclusions are close to each other. This high dynamic 
stress concentration inevitably results in the fatigue failure of engineering structures and this region should 
be taken care in the design phase. The variation of DMCF along the azimuthal coordinate is significant 
when ka or the size of a circular damage increases. Comparing with the result of one inclusion shown in 
Fig. 8, the more intensity of the far field backscattering is observed in Fig. 18 and in general the tendency 
is comparable but the case of the hole. For the case of L/a=2.1, Fig. 19 shows the variation of far field 
scattering patterns of two flexible inclusions with a corrosion-induced 30% reduction in thickness, as the 
size of a circular damage or incident wave number increases (ka = 0.1, 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0). Comparing with 
the results of one inclusion shown in Fig. 9, the larger intensity of the far field scattering is observed. The 
scattering patterns vary considerably and become more skewed towards forward scattering as ka increases. 
In the case of L/a = 4.0, Figs. 20-22 show the distribution of DMCF along the circular boundary of the 
upper flexible inclusion when the different size of a circular damage (ka=0.5, 1.0 and 3.0) and the 
different corrosion-induced thinning (h/h0=0.0005, 0.5 and 0.75) were considered. Comparing Fig. 4 with

The collocation multipole method for acoustic problems 
with elliptical boundaries

Abstract 
A semi-analytical approach is presented to solve two-dimensional interior and exterior 
acoustic problems with elliptical boundaries. The eigenproblems for the interior domain and 
the scattering problems for the exterior domain are both to be investigated. To satisfy the 
Helmholtz equation in elliptical coordinates, the multipole expansion for the acoustic pressure 
is formulated in terms of angular and radial Mathieu functions. The boundary conditions are 
satisfied by uniformly collocating points on the boundaries. The acoustic pressure at each 
boundary point is directly calculated in each local elliptical coordinate system. For the 
multiply connected domain problems, the normal derivative of the acoustic pressure is 
calculated by using the appropriate directional derivative in different coordinate systems, an 
alternative to the addition theorem. By truncating the multipole expansion, a finite linear 
algebraic system is derived. For the interior eigenproblem, the direct searching approach is 
employed to determine the natural frequencies by using the singular value decomposition 
(SVD). Eigensolutions obtained by the present method are compared well with those of the 
analytical method and finite element method (ABAQUS). The spurious eigensolutions are not 
found in the proposed formulation. For the exterior acoustic scattering problem subject to an 
incident plane sound wave, the scattered field is constructed which satisfies the Helmholtz 
equation as well as the radiation condition at infinity. Both Dirichlet (sound-soft) and 
Neumann (sound-hard) conditions are considered. The proposed results are compared well 
with those of the boundary element method. The near-field acoustic pressure and the far-field 
scattering pattern are both investigated to consider the effect of the space between scatterers 
and the incident wave number on them. Excellent accuracy and fast rate of convergence are 
the main features of the present method thanks to the semi-analytical procedure.  
1. Introduction 
Natural frequencies and their corresponding modes of an acoustic cavity can provide 
important information in the design phase for the cavity related to the mechanical system such 
as automobile mufflers and hermetic compressors. As regards the acoustic scattered by 
obstacles, it has been an object of study for a long time since its results of corresponding 
studies can be found in many applications  such as locating sound source and noise control, etc. 
Although these problems can be solved by using numerical methods, such as the finite element 
method (FEM) and the boundary element method (BEM), analytical or semi-analytical 
solutions, if available, usually result in accurate and fast rate convergence methodologies and 
provide the physical insight to the considered problems. Consequently, a semi-analytical or a 
point-matching approach to these problems will be proposed in this paper.

as shown in Fig. 1 ( for the interior case), where Bj denotes the jth elliptical boundary. We will 
use L+1 observer coordinate systems: (z1, z2) are global Cartesian coordinates centered at 
O; ( , )j jξ η , j=1,…, L are the jth local elliptical coordinates centered at Oj, ( 1 2,j jz z ). The major 
and minor semi axes of jth ellipse are aj and bj, respectively, and its local coordinate system 
makes an angle jθ  with respect to the global coordinate system. The governing equation is the 
Helmholtz equation: 
2 2( ) ( ) 0, Ωk P x x∇ + = ∈ , (2)
where 2∇  is the Laplace operator, P is the acoustic pressure, k = / cω  is the wave number, ω  
is the radian frequency, c is the speed of sound in the acoustic medium, x is a typical field 
point. 
To properly deal with the considered geometry, the elliptical coordinates [6-11] should be 
used. The elliptical coordinates ( , )ξ η  are related the rectangular coordinates ( , )x y  by the 
relation 
cosh( )x iy f iξ η+ = + , (3)
where 1i = − , ξ  is a radial coordinate ( 0ξ ≥ ), η  is an angular coordinate (0 2η π≤ < ) and 
2f is the interfocal distance. 
In elliptical coordinates, using the transformation of Eq. (3), the Helmholtz equation of 
Eq. (2) takes the form

where jξ  and jη  (j= 1, 2,…, L) denote elliptical coordinates of the field point x with respect 
to the jth local elliptical coordinate system . The normal derivative can be easily expressed 
by
hξ ξ
∂
∂  when the field point on the boundary of an ellipse is described by its local elliptical 
coordinate system. On the other hand, while the field point is on the boundary of another 
ellipse, the normal derivative should be determined with care to consider the relation between 
two corresponding coordinate systems. 
To determine these unknown coefficients, the calculation of Eq. (13) or (14) is needed. 
But this procedure involves the derivative of multivariable functions and this is not an easy 
task. It is well known that the addition theorem can be employed to solve this problem [16]. 
However, the addition theorem of Mathieu functions will make the formulation and the 
corresponding numerical calculation complicated due to its complicated form. In this project, 
Eqs. (13) and (14) are directly calculated without using the addition theorem of Mathieu 
functions. In order to achieve this, two difficulties must be surmounted. One is the 
determination of elliptical coordinates with respect to different local coordinate system. The 
other is how to calculate the generalized normal derivative of the acoustic pressure with 
respect to the elliptical coordinate system, i.e., the normal derivative with any specified 
direction which usually means the normal to the boundary at the collocation point in this 
project.

derivative in gjA . After determining the element of the linear algebraic system, based on the 
direct-searching scheme [39], the natural frequencies will be determined by detecting the drop 
of the minimum singular value of Eq. (22) by performing a frequency sweep.

6. Concluding remarks 
The eigenproblems for the interior domain and the scattering problems for the exterior 
domain have been successfully solved by using the collocation multipole method. The angular 
and radial Mathieu functions are employed to represent the acoustic field that satisfies the 
Helmholtz equation in the elliptical coordinate system and the radiation condition at infinity. 
Instead of using the addition theorem for the Mathieu functions, the normal derivative of the 
acoustic pressure is calculated using the appropriate directional derivative in the multiply-
connected domain problem. The boundary conditions are satisfied by uniformly collocating 
points on the boundaries. The proposed algorithm has a concise formulation without requiring 
complicated numerical calculations caused by the infinite series form of the addition theorem. 
Numerical results of the present method match well with those of the FEM and BEM. It 
follows from several numerical experiments that the accuracy of the present method is 
superior to the results of the FEM and the BEM, and spurious eigenvalues and fictitious 
frequencies are not found in our formulation. Good accuracy and high rate of convergence are 
the main features of the present method thanks to the semi-analytical procedure.

(英文) This project has successively developed a reliable and highly computational efficiency 
program by using the multipole method and addition theorem. It can solve the scattering 
problem for a thin plate with multiple circular holes or inclusions subject to an incident 
flexural wave and calculates the associated near field dynamic moment concentration 
factor (DMCF) around the circular inclusion and the far field scattering pattern. The 
features of the developed program are as follows: (1) the number and the dimension of 
circular holes or inclusions are unlimited, and (2) the inclusion considers different input 
parameters such as the thickness, the Young’s modulus, the density and the Poisson’s 
ratio. In addition to the numerical date to be provided, the polar plot of the DMCF, the 
dispersion curve for the DMCF and the polar plot of scattering patterns are available for 
the safety evaluation in the engineering structure.
