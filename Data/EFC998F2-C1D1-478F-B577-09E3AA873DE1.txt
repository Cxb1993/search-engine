Abstract: DNA-binding domains/proteins play essential roles in a cell, which are 
involved in transcription, replication, packaging, repair and rearrangement. 
Numerous prediction methods of DNA-binding domains/proteins were proposed by 
identifying informative features and designing effective classifiers. These researches 
reveal that the DNA-protein binding mechanism is complicated and existing accurate 
predictors such as support vector machine (SVM) with position specific scoring 
matrices (PSSMs) are regarded as black-box methods which are not easily 
interpretable for biologists. It is desirable to design predictors using interpretable 
features and classifiers, and the prediction results are explainable for knowledge 
acquisition. In this study, we propose an ensemble fuzzy rule base classifier 
consisting of a set of interpretable fuzzy rule classifiers (iFRCs) using informative 
physicochemical properties as features. In designing iFRCs, feature selection, 
membership function design, and fuzzy rule base generation are all simultaneously 
optimized using an intelligent genetic algorithm (IGA). IGA maximizes prediction 
accuracy, minimizes the number of features selected, and minimizes the number of 
fuzzy rules to generate an accurate and concise fuzzy rule base. Benchmark datasets 
of DNA-binding domains are used to evaluate the proposed ensemble classifier of 30 
iFRCs. Each iFRC has a mean test accuracy of 77.46%, and the ensemble classifier has 
a test accuracy of 83.33%, where the method of SVM with PSSMs has the accuracy of 
82.81%. The physicochemical properties of the first two ranks according to their 
contribution are positive charge and Van Der Waals volume. Charge 
complementarity between protein and DNA is thought to be important in the first 
step of recognition between protein and DNA. The amino acid residues of binding 
peptides have larger Van Der Waals volumes and positive charges than those of non-
binding ones. The proposed knowledge acquisition method by establishing a fuzzy 
rule-based classifier can also be applicable to predict and analyze other protein 
functions from sequences.

A fuzzy rule-based knowledge acquisition system (FRKAS) using an ensemble 
fuzzy rule classifier consisting of 30 iFRCs is proposed for prediction and analyse of 
DNA-BPs. Each iFRCs has two fuzzy rules, one for binding and the other for non-
binding prediction. The ensemble classifier using eight physicochemical properties 
performs well with a test accuracy of 83.33%, compared with an individual SVM with 
PSSMs (82.81%) [6] and SVM with 22 physicochemical properties (80.73%) [9]. The 
physicochemical properties of the first two ranks according to their contribution are 
positive charge and Van Der Waals volume. The amino acid residues of binding 
peptides have larger Van Der Waals volumes and positive charges than those of non-
binding ones.  
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The framework of the proposed FRKAS is given in Fig. 1. FRKAS uses an 
ensemble fuzzy rule classifier consisting of 30 interpretable fuzzy rule classifiers 
(iFRCs). The design aim of iFRCs is to generate an accurate and concise fuzzy rule 
base. The following sections present the used datasets, feature sets, the design of 
iFRCs, the ensemble fuzzy classifier and knowledge acquisition of DNA-binding 
domains.  
Datasets 
For comparisons with existing methods [6], [9], the same benchmark dataset 
DNAset, also called main dataset from Kumar et al. [6] was used to establish an 
ensemble fuzzy rule classifier. DNAset has 146 non-redundant DNA-binding domains 
(or protein chains) in which no two domains have the sequence identity of more than 
25%. A non-redundant set of 250 non-binding domains was obtained from Stawiski et 
al. [4]. They used following criteria: 1) no two protein chains have similarity more 
than 25% and 2) the approximate size and electrostatics are similar to DNA-BPs. An 
independent data set DNAiset is additionally used, having 92 DNA-binding domains 
and 100 non-DNA-binding proteins [6]. 
Feature sets 
The method Auto-IDPCPs [9] consists of three tasks: 1) clustering 531 vectors 
of physicochemical and biochemical properties in the AAindex database into 20 
classes using a fuzzy c-means algorithm, 2) utilizing an efficient genetic algorithm 
based optimization method to select an informative feature set to represent sequences, 
and 3) analyzing the selected feature vectors to identify the related physicochemical 
properties which may affect the binding mechanism of DNA-BPs. 
Auto-IDPCPs [9] used a systematic approach to automatically identify a set of 
23 properties for predicting and analyzing DNA-binding domains/proteins in the 
dataset DNAset. The 23 properties belonging to five clusters are used to design the 
proposed ensemble fuzzy rule classifiers, shown in Table 1. 
Interpretable fuzzy rule classifiers (iFRCs) 
High performance of iFRCs mainly arises from two aspects. One is to 
simultaneously optimize all parameters in the design of iFRCs where all the elements 
of the fuzzy classifier design have been transformed into parameters of a large 
parameter optimization problem. The other is to use an efficient optimization 
algorithm IGA which is a specific variant of the intelligent evolutionary algorithm

ALL, i.e., don’t care. 
In the training phase, all the variables CLj and CFj are treated as parametric 
genes encoded in a chromosome and their values are obtained using IGA. The 
following fuzzy reasoning method is adopted to determine the class of an input 
pattern xp = (xp1, xp2, . . ., xpn) based on voting using multiple fuzzy if–then rules: 
Step 1: Calculate score SClassv (v = 1, . . . , C) for each class as follows:

where FC denotes the fuzzy classifier, and μji(·) represents the membership 
function of the antecedent fuzzy set Aji. 
Step 2: Classify xp as the class with a maximal value of SClassv. 
Notably, xp is classified into the binding or non-binding class for one iFRC. The 
final classification of xp is determined using the proposed ensemble classifier 
consisting of 30 iFRCs in the study. 
Chromosome representation of IGA 
A chromosome consists of control genes for selecting useful features 
(physicochemical properties) and significant fuzzy rules, and parametric genes for 
encoding the membership functions and fuzzy rules. The control genes comprise two 
types of parameters. One is parameters for selecting features. The other is parameters 
for selecting fuzzy rules. The parametric genes determine variables of three types: 
t
jiV ∈ [0, 1], t=1, …, 5, for determining the antecedent fuzzy set Aji, CLj for 
determining the consequent class label of rule Rj, and CFj ∈ [0, 1] for determining the 
certainty grade of rule Rj , where j=1, …, N and i=1, …, n. A rule base with N fuzzy 
rules is represented as an individual. The detailed explanation of the chromosome 
representation and implementation can be referred to [12]. The design of an efficient 
fuzzy classifier is formulated as a large parameter optimization problem. Once the 
solution of IGA is obtained, an accurate classifier with a concise fuzzy rule base can 
be obtained. 
Fitness function of IGA 
We define the fitness function of IGA for designing iFRCs as follows: 
max Fit(FC) = ACC − WrNr − WfNf                                     (3) 
where Wr and Wf are positive weights. In this study, the fitness function is used to 
optimize the three objectives: 1) to maximize the classification accuracy ACC, 2) to 
minimize the number Nr of fuzzy rules, and 3) to minimize the number Nf of selected 
features. For obtaining an easily-interpretable knowledge rule base for each iFRC, the 
smaller values of Nr and Nf are better. Therefore, we used large values of weights Wr = 
0.2 and Wf = 0.1. Since the classification accuracy is not the first priority for iFRC, 
the ensemble fuzzy rule base classifier (EFRBC) consists of k (e.g., 30) iFRCs is 
necessary for obtaining high accuracy of predicting DNA-BPs. 
Ensemble fuzzy rule base classifier (EFRBC) 
There are three opinions for using an ensemble strategy [14]: 1) Statistical: the 
reason is related to lack of adequate data to properly represent the data distribution; 2) 
 - 8 - 
Hydrophobicity (Zimmerman et al., 1968)). The rules R1 and R2 with fuzzy sets are 
binding and non-binding rules, respectively. The descriptions of two rules are given as 
follows: 
R1: if H252 is {medium, large} and H398 is {medium, large}, then binding with 
CF1=0.196. 
R2: if H252 is {small, medium} and H398 is {small, medium}, then non-binding 
with CF2=0.549. 
For example, a query sequence xp has normalized values of H252 and H398, 0.4 
and 0.3, respectively. The classification procedure using this iFRC is described as 
follows: 
Step 1: Use equation (1) to calculate the values of membership functions ub() and un() 
for binding and non-binding, respectively.  
The value of ub1(0.4) is 0.537 for H252 and the value of ub2(0.3) is 1.0 for 
H398. The values of un1(0.4) is 0.606 for H252 and the value of un2(0.3) is 1.0 
for H398. The binding value of ub(xp) is ub1(0.4) x ub2(0.3)=0.537 and the non-
binding value of un(xp)=un1(0.4)* un2(0.3)= 0.606. 
Step 2:  Use equation (2) to calculate the score for each class. 
Because the non-binding score Sclass =un(xp)*CF2 =0.333 is larger than the 
binding score Sclass =ub(xp)*CF1=0.105, the query sequence by using the single 
iFRC is classified into the non-binding class. 
The fuzzy regions of binding and non-binding are illustrated in Fig. 4. The final 
classification of the query sequence using the proposed ensemble classifier is 
determined using the voting result of k=30 iFRCs. Generally, if the query sequence is 
located near the boundary of some fuzzy regions, the ensemble strategy can improve 
the prediction accuracy. 
Results 
The parameter settings of IGA [11] are Npop = 20, Pc = 0.7, Ps =1−Pc, Pm = 0.01 
and α = 15. Because the search space of the optimal design of iFRCs is proportional 
to the number Np of parameters to be optimized, the stopping condition is suggested to 
use a fixed number 100Np of fitness evaluations. 
Prediction performance evaluation 
The training samples with 23 properties in the dataset DNAset are represented as 
23-dimensional feature vectors. This set of 23 physicochemical properties is identified 
by Auto-IDPCPs [9]. The dataset DNAiset was used for evaluating test performance 
of iFRCs and the ensemble classifier EFRBC. Due to the non-deterministic 
characteristic of genetic algorithms, the best iFRC with high training accuracy is 
selected for testing DNAiset from 30 runs. The average performance of 30 
independent iFRCs in EFRBC is given in Table 2.  
The SVM-based classifier with PSSMs has the training and test accuracies of 
86.62% and 82.81%, respectively. The SVM-based classifier with 22 
physicochemical properties identified by Auto-IDPCPs has high training accuracy 
87.12% and a relatively small accuracy of 80.73%. The average performance of 
iFRCs has the training and test accuracies of 74.32% and 77.46%, respectively, 
without significant over-training problems. The average number of features is Nf 
 - 10 - 
phosphate anions, eliminating repulsive interactions with fractional negative charges 
at neighboring phosphates [17]. 
Discussion  
To avoid from overfitting the small-scale datasets in identifying 
physicochemical properties using an optimization approach, this study proposes a 
hybrid computational method of combining evidences by considering robust factors 
from the viewpoints of statistics and biological experiments from literature. It can be 
expected that the proposed method can effectively discover and rank more 
informative physicochemical and biochemical properties closely relative to the DNA-
binding mechanism if the size of the training dataset is significantly increased. These 
discovered properties in predicting and analyzing the DNA-binding mechanism can 
be further investigated by biologists.  
Conclusions  
This study has proposed a systematic fuzzy rule based knowledge acquisition 
system (FRKAS) to predict and analyze DNA-binding domains/proteins. The merits 
of FRKAS can be summarized, described below. 
1) The novel interpretable fuzzy rule classifiers (iFRCs) using informative 
physicochemical properties as features are proposed in this study. The features 
and classifiers are more helpful for understanding the binding mechanism rather 
than the SVM with PSSMs. 
2) To obtain an accurate and concise fuzzy rule base, an intelligent genetic algorithm 
is utilized to optimize simultaneously the three objectives: maximizing prediction 
accuracy, minimizing the number of features selected, and minimizing the number 
of fuzzy rules. The designers can tune the weights in the weighted sum approach 
according to the preference to the three objectives. 
3) Due to the small size of the training dataset, an ensemble classifier consisting of 
iFRCs is adopted to compensate the limitation, resulting in high-accuracy and 
robust performance. 
4) The design of FRKAS considers both prediction accuracy and interpretability at 
the same time. FRKAS can also be applicable to predict and analyze other protein 
functions from sequences.

Abstract—Carbohydrate-binding proteins play a pivotal 
role in a variety of important biological recognition 
processes. Compared with most studies of predicting 
binding sites, very few studies investigate prediction of 
carbohydrate-binding proteins. This paper proposes a 
highly interpretable scoring card method for predicting 
carbohydrate-binding proteins. First, a large-scale data set 
of carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBPDB) collected from 
three up-to-date databases, CAZy, CGF and Swiss-Prot is 
utilized. The data set CBPDB consists of 2380 positive and 
negative proteins with sequence identity 25% by removing 
sequence redundancy. Secondly, we adopt a novel scoring 
card method by way of generating an optimized scoring 
card of dipeptides to predict the carbohydrate-binding 
proteins. The prediction performance is promising with an 
independent test accuracy of 78.67%. The dipeptide score 
is helpful in discovering motif. The scoring card provides 
an insight of further analyzing the binding mechanism 
between carbohydrate and proteins.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Carbohydrates play an essential role in a variety of 
important biological recognition processes like infection, 
immune response, cell differentiation, and neuronal 
development. All of these biological phenomena may be 
regulated by the interaction of these carbohydrates with 
proteins [1-5]. Carbohydrate-binding proteins are becoming 
extremely useful in curing various illnesses. Experimental 
work for identifying carbohydrate-binding proteins is costly 
and time consuming. Therefore, effective computational 
methods for predicting carbohydrate-binding proteins are 
desirable. 
It is vitally important to develop an automated and 
efficient method for timely identification of novel 
carbohydrate-binding proteins. However, some researches of 
using empirical rules [6] or machine learning methods [7] 
mainly focused on prediction and analysis of carbohydrate-
binding sites of proteins that are already known as 
carbohydrate-binding proteins. 
Someya et al. [8] first clarified the definition carbohydrate-
binding proteins and then constructed positive and negative 
datasets. Using both informative features and an appropriate 
classifier is essential to design an effective method for 
predicting carbohydrate-binding proteins based on the primary 
sequence only. They developed a carbohydrate-binding 
protein prediction system by using support vector machines 
(SVMs) [9], where the prediction of carbohydrate-binding 
proteins was formulated as a binary classification problem. 
Someya et al. [8] trained the SVM with three different 
encoding methods: a direct encoding method (AA-20), and 
two grouping methods (Levitt-6 and Someya-7). The SVM-
based method with AA-20 performs well with a leave-one-out 
accuracy of 87% for the sequence with a sequence identity 
35%.  
Kumar et al. [10] developed SVM modules for 
distinguishing between cancer and non-cancerlectin proteins 
by using dipeptide composition, split composition, position 
specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profiles and PSSM with 14 
PROSITE domains as input features.  
The merits of this study are to 1) utilize a large-scale data 
set of carbohydrate-binding proteins collected from three up-to-
date databases, CAZy, CGF and Swiss-Prot, 2) propose an 
easily interpretable method rather than the black-box-like SVM 
for biologists, and 3) obtain a robust performance with 
accuracy of 78.67% on carbohydrate-binding proteins with 
sequence identity 25%. 
II. MATERIALS 
A. Datasets 
Carbohydrate binding proteins are obtained from the 
Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) database and 
Carbohydrate Active Enzyme (CAZy) database. All the 
records from these two databases are served as positive protein 
samples which can bind carbohydrate. The Gene Ontology 
(GO) annotation terms about carbohydrate-binding functions 
are obtained from the GOA database. The GO term, 
carbohydrate binding function, and its child terms are 
collected. Finally, the number of GO terms which are defined 
as carbohydrate binding function is 778.

C. Scoring card  
The ten statistics scoring cards in inner loop were averaged 
to one scoring card (the arrow illustration in Fig.1). Afterward 
the average scoring card was evaluated by ten validation 
datasets. Ten best thresholds would be derived from ten 
validations, and then the average of the ten thresholds was 
used in the classification of independent test. In the final step, 
there only had one scoring card, one threshold and one test 
result. 
D.  IGA-scoring card 
The scoring card is further optimized by an intelligent 
genetic algorithm (IGA) [13] [14]. IGA utilizes an orthogonal 
array (OA) [15] that was used in the crossover operation to 
bring the better children than the traditional crossover method, 
and it can efficiently obtain a high-quality solution set. 
Orthogonal array is a fractional factorial array, which assures 
a balanced comparison of levels of any factor.  
Ten validation data sets were used for evaluating the fitness 
function. The algorithm of generating the IGA-scoring card is 
described as follows: 
Step 1: Initial population 
 The half of initial population in the IGA-scoring card 
consists of the ten statistic scoring cards in an inner loop, 
and the other ten individuals in the initial population were 
randomly generated from scores 0 to 1000. Therefore, the 
initial population comprises Npop individuals totally and 
Npop＝20. 
Step 2: Evaluation 
 The fitness function of every individual was appraised via 
AUC from TPR and FPR. 
 
TPR = TP/ (TP+FN) (2) 
FPR = FP/ (FP+TN) (3) 
  
Where TP is true positive and FP is false positive. In the 
ROC curve, X axle is FPR and Y axle is TPR. The 
validation data were used to find the best threshold 
according to the highest accuracy and it can get both TPR 
and FPR values from each threshold. TPR and FPR were 
used to draw the ROC curve and evaluate the fitness 
function for every individual. 
Step 3: Selection 
 Use the traditional tournament selection that selects the 
winner from two randomly selected individuals to form a 
mating pool. 
Step 4: Crossover 
 Select Pc•Npop parents from the mating pool to perform 
orthogonal array crossover on the selected pairs of parents 
where Pc is the crossover probability. Pc＝0.9. 
Step 5: Mutation 
 Apply the real number mutation operator to the randomly 
mutated the gene from 0 to 1000 if the generated digit < 
Pm, where Pm is the mutation probability. Pm＝0.01. 
Step 6: Termination 
 When the IGA come to 100 generations is the stop 
condition and output the best individual as IGA-scoring 
card. Otherwise, go to Step 2. 
 
This flow chart is divided into training and test processes. 
In the training part of the beginning, it used the training dataset 
to build a scoring card, then the scoring card is optimized by 
IGA with the validation dataset to get the best scoring card and 
threshold value. In the test process, the input sample could 
obtain a score through the scoring card.

Abstract— Bioluminescence proteins are becoming increasingly 
important in a variety of research fields such as in situ imaging 
and the study of protein-protein interactions in vivo, and 
increased spectral variety of bioluminescent reporters is needed 
for further progress. The existing method BLProt using support 
vector machine (SVM) and physicochemical properties to predict 
bioluminescence proteins.  The BLProt method identified the 
most prominent features using various filter approaches, ReliefF, 
infogain, and mRMR. BLProt utilized 100 features to achieve a 
training accuracy of 80% and test accuracy of 80.06%. 
Physicochemical properties are well recognized to be effective in 
designing various predictors for understanding the functions and 
characteristics of proteins. In this study, we propose an efficient 
method for designing predictors of bioluminescence proteins 
using a small set of informative physicochemical properties 
obtained by using an inheritable bi-objective genetic algorithm. 
The benchmark datasets were used to evaluate the proposed 
method using SVM and informative physicochemical properties 
as the features. The prediction accuracy of independent test is 
81.79% using 15 properties. From the analysis of informative 
physicochemical properties, some knowledge of bioluminescent 
problems can be revealed. The proposed physicochemical 
property mining method can be used conveniently as the core for 
designing predictors for various types of bioluminescent 
problems.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Bioluminescence is a light producing process. The basic 
two factors included in this process are luciferase and luciferin, 
which are the catalytic enzyme and its substrate respectively. 
Work on bioluminescence is actively pursued at all levels, 
such as naturalist or phtochemist, due to it abnormal 
characters. The visible light, generated from luciferase, is 
emitted at room temperature while light often can be generated 
at extreme high temperature causing violent oxidation of some 
objects. The actual emission of bioluminescence is the 
extremely rapid final process of usually multistep reaction. 
Most often, the excited state of luciferin is excited by electron 
or photon [1].   
Bioluminescence provides an ideal tool to solve scientific 
problems. Previous studies [2] are already renowned for the 
preparation and application of an extended series of 
radiometric ion-sensitive indicators and a number of 
sophisticated reporter molecules based on fluorescence 
resonance energy transfer (FRET). In order to generate 
genetically encoded FRET probes which are suitable for 
radiometric measurements, more fluorophores are need to be 
discovered or generated. 
However, the biofunction of those bioluminescence 
proteins are quite alike, they do not share strongly 
homologous. Many orgasms use different proteins which have 
different mechanisms to generate light [3]. Bioluminescence 
proteins are becoming increasingly important in a variety of 
research fields such as in situ imaging and the study of 
protein-protein interactions in vivo, and increased spectral 
variety of bioluminescent reporters is needed for further 
progress.  
Beside the bioluminescent characters, some characters are 
also interesting. First, the luciferins are extremely hydrophobic 
macro molecules. To catalyze the molecules, the catalytic sites 
must be very different to tune the catalytic orientation between 
the enzymes and subtracts. Secondly, the bioluminescence 
light in some live orgasms, like firefly, is regulated. The GFP 
does not have a significant regulation structure like the C-
terminal ball-chain structure of voltage-dependent gate 
channel on neuron. But some regulation mechanisms still 
occur for this purpose [4]. Third, the bioluminescence does not 
share homologous but they have a similar function. 
Understanding physicochemical properties of the 
bioluminescence proteins may help improve the applications 
of bioluminescence proteins. 
Kandaswamy et al. [5] proposed an accurate prediction 
method BLProt that uses a support vector machine (SVM) and 
physicochemical properties to predict bioluminescence 
proteins. BLProt used a training dataset consisting of 300 
bioluminescence proteins and 300 non-bioluminescence 
proteins, and an independent test dataset consisting of 141 
bioluminescence proteins and 18202 non-bioluminescence 
proteins. To identify the most prominent features, they carried 
out feature selection with three different filter approaches, 
ReliefF, infogain, and mRMR. For the aim of designing 
accurate prediction methods, the major concern is to identify 
feature vectors with high discrimination abilities for 
classifying positive and negative samples. Their feature 
selection method suffers from a large set of candidate features. 
We investigate the optimal design of predictors for 
discrimination in this paper. The GA-chromosome consists of 
n=531 binary GA-genes bi for selecting informative properties 
and two 4-bit GA-genes for tuning the parameters C and γ of 
SVM. If bi=0, the i
th
 property is excluded from the SVM 
classifier; otherwise, the i
th
 property is included. This encoding 
method maps the 16 values of  and C into {2-7, 2-6…, 28}.  
The feature vector for training the SVM classifier is 
obtained from decoding a GA-chromosome using the 
following steps. Consider a given DNA-PBs sequence. At first, 
the index vectors for all selected physicochemical properties 
are constructed from AAindex for each amino acid. Feature 
vector of a peptide consists of the selected features whose 
values are obtained by averaging the values in their 
corresponding index vectors. Finally, all values of the feature 
vectors are normalized into [-1, 1] for applying SVM. 
Fitness function is the only guide for IBCGA to obtain 
desirable solutions. The fitness function of IBCGA is the 5-
CV overall accuracy. IBCGA with the fitness function f(X) 
can simultaneously obtain a set of solutions, Xr, where r=rstart, 
rstart+1, …, rend in a single run. The algorithm of IBCGA with 
the given values rstart and rend is described as follows: 
Step 1) (Initiation) Randomly generate an initial population 
of Npop individuals. All the n binary GA-genes have r 
1’s and n-r 0’s where r = rstart. 
Step 2) (Evaluation) Evaluate the fitness values of all 
individuals using f(X). 
Step 3) (Selection) Use the traditional tournament selection 
that selects the winner from two randomly selected 
individuals to form a mating pool. 
Step 4) (Crossover) Select pc ·Npop parents from the mating 
pool to perform orthogonal array crossover on the 
selected pairs of parents where pc is the crossover 
probability. 
Step 5) (Mutation) Apply the swap mutation operator to the 
randomly selected pm ·Npop individuals in the new 
population where pm is the mutation probability. To 
prevent the best fitness value from deteriorating, 
mutation is not applied to the best individual. 
Step 6) (Termination test) If the stopping condition for 
obtaining the solution Xr is satisfied, output the best 
individual as Xr. Otherwise, go to Step 2). In this 
study, the stopping condition is to perform 40 
generations. 
Step 7) (Inheritance) If r < rend, randomly change one bit in 
the binary GA-genes for each individual from 0 to 1; 
increase the number r by one, and go to Step 2). 
Otherwise, stop the algorithm. 
D. Prediction Method PBLP 
The selected m physicochemical properties and the 
associated parameter set of SVM by using PBPL are used to 
implement the computational system and analyze the 
physicochemical properties to further understand the BLPs. 
Since the PBPL is a non-deterministic method, it should make 
more effort to identify an efficient and robust feature set of 
informative physicochemical properties in five aspects. The 
procedure is as the following steps: 
 
Step 1 : We prepare the independent data sets where each set 
is used as the training data set of 5-CV. 
Step 2 : PBPL is performed R independent runs for each of 
independent data sets. In this study, R = 30. There are 
total 30 sets of m physicochemical properties for each 
of independent data sets.  
Step 3 : Choose the set of selected physicochemical properties 
with a maximal accuracy.   
 
PBLDs will automatically determine a set of informative 
physicochemical properties and an SVM-model for prediction 
bioluminescent and non- bioluminescence proteins. 
 
III. RESULTS 
A. Results of training and test datasets  
The training data sets contain 300 positive and 300 
negative samples. The sequence similarity of the training data 
set is smaller than 40%. We performed 30 independent runs of 
PBPL to select robust feature set which could improve the 
performance of SVM classifier on discriminating the two 
classes of proteins. The highest training accuracy of 30 PBPL 
runs was 84.11% and its corresponding test accuracy was 
81.79%. (Table 2).  
 
Table 2. Results of the training and independent test by 
BLProt and PBLP. 
 
B. Selected a small set of physicochemical properties. 
The quantified effectiveness of individual physicochemical 
properties on prediction is useful to characterize the PBLP 
mechanism by physicochemical properties. Orthogonal 
experimental design with factor analysis can be used to 
estimate the individual effects of physicochemical properties 
according to the value of main effect difference (MED) [7, 12]. 
The property with the largest value of MED is the most 
effective in predicting BLPs. 
According to MED, the 15 informative properties are 
ranked and their descriptions are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 1. 
The most effective property with MED=16.16668 is 
RACS820111 denoting “Differential geometry and polymer 
conformation. Conformational and nucleation properties of 
individual amino acids”.
