摘要 
隨著網際網路的普及與網站架設方法日益簡易，網路商店面對不斷增加的競爭者，
使得生存發展更加困難。經營者必須迎合或找出消費者現有或潛在的需求，以維持企業
競爭力；產品推薦系統在網路購物環境中，不僅有助於網購消費者對產品產生焦點，常
常也是完成線上交易的催化劑，是一項可以增加企業競爭力的功能。目前線上的產品推
薦系統，大多以歷史資料為基礎，利用探勘技術挖掘顧客特質和交易關聯性，作為商品
推薦依據。但資料探勘往往需要龐大的歷史資料才能準確地產生推薦商品項目。而具有
相同背景的顧客不一定擁有相同的喜好，一視同仁的資料探勘推薦方式有其盲點。此
外，由於應用歷史資料為基礎，其產品推薦無法反應瀏覽者尋找所需的商品與資訊當下
之心理狀況。因此，以歷史資料過濾探勘的推薦方式並不是一個有效率的方法。 
以女性內衣為例之時尚產品設計，內衣不只是穿著的功能，同時付予許多心理型態
特質的訴求。當產品型態特性訴求吻合瀏覽者人格特質，將吸引並影響其瀏覽行為。本
研究基於產品設計型態特性、人格特質與瀏覽即時行為，建構出瀏覽者產品喜好指數
(Custom’s product likeness index，CPLI)，作為個人化產品即時推薦依據。本瀏覽者個人
化產品即時推薦技術主要是應用瀏覽者即時的線上活動，再結合瀏覽者人格特質與產品
設計型態特性所建構而成，可彌補傳統推薦系統必需透過龐大的歷史資料才能準確推薦
的缺點。此外，透過本系統可以精確掌握並反應瀏覽者尋找所需商品與資訊當下之心理
狀況。我們以台灣知名內衣品牌產品為例建構測試系統驗證推薦產品準確性，並將瀏覽
者滿意度資訊回饋給設計者，作為設計變更或新內衣設計參考。實驗結果顯示本研究的
個人化產品推薦評估分析技術可以即時、精準地預測網路瀏覽者對產品的喜好並有效推
薦商品項目。期望本研究之分析模式及系統，能作為時尚產品購物網站業者，建構商品
推薦系統之參考。

網際網路早已成為現代人接收資訊的主要媒介之ㄧ。由於網路的發達，也促使企業投資
在網路行銷、電子商務的比重逐漸增加。根據 Neil Patel(2006)在其 five ways to optimize

本研究主要目的，在於應用瀏覽者瀏覽網站的習慣，結合使用者人格型態，建置一
個人化商品推薦系統。系統首先會分析使用者的人格特質，根據其人格特質的種類選取
瀏覽者回饋方程式各項目權重。並且記錄瀏覽者點擊商品順序、停留時間以及重複瀏覽
商品的次數等等行為，分析其對特定商品的喜好程度，進行個人化商品的推薦。同時系
也會透過網頁的人格類別問卷，收集統計各種人格特質使用者對瀏覽者偏好項目，來作
為推薦方程各行為項目的調整依據。期望能逐漸提升商品推薦系統之成效，更能提高準
確的預測使用者個人的偏好。

為建立各式商品的特性，依據研發單位初始設計概念，將每個型號依其特性分析，
先期歸納並寫入資料庫如表 2-1，並把五大人格的特性結合商品設計的特性分群如表
2-2，以利後續研究進行；本研究再以網路問卷的方式，讓使用者一進系統，就先填寫
相關問卷，以區隔使用者的人格型態，認為哪種瀏覽行為權重值較能符合自己對商品的
偏好度。將前測樣品的人格特質依照 Costa and McCrae 五大人格特質分類，共分為五種
類型。計算不同產品對瀏覽行為各項特性的重視度，其商品特性資料如表 2-1。如 R8223
由美觀、性感、舒適三種特性結合而成。 
依據各產品的商品特性分類，結合五大人格的特質，如敏感性的特質有害羞、沮喪
等等的因子，在商品特性有集中、托高與舒適性，有助於提升自信與活力等等。如 O 型
開放性具有設計感、復古、透氣、柔軟等等的商品特性。

ABSTRACT  
The rapid spread of the Internet has made both companies and customers face a new 
situation. Whereas companies are harder to survive due to more and more competitions, Web 
users have difficulty finding the information or product due to the increase in available 
information afforded by the Internet has resulted in information overload. A product 
recommendation systems, that provides users with an ordered list of items and information 
that help them to decide which items to consider or look at based on the individual user 
preferences is an enabling mechanism to overcome information overload occurred.  
To date, a variety of recommendation techniques has been developed and applied, such as 
collaborative filtering, data mining approaches, content-based prediction etc. Those 
techniques are used to determine product recommendation or to select advertisements for 
display to particular customers based on demographics and the past buying behavior of 
individual customers. A common feature of established recommendation systems is the need 
for analysis over a large set of customer data, or data for a large number of customers. 
Moreover, even in the same group, customers may differ in their likeness, it may not be 
effective to show the same advertisements to all the customers satisfying some conditions. In 
fashion products business (such as underwear), the product styles are always designed based 
on consumer’s personality traits. Beside, a product style which fits consumer’s personality 
traits will attract customer and influence upon consumer’s browsing behavior.  
To overcome the shortages of above, this paper will create a new recommendation 
technique based on a customer’s product likeness index, which integrates customer’s 
personality traits, product style with real-time browsing among in product categories. For the 
evaluation of the methodology, a product recommender prototype systems, which sale fashion 
products (such as underwear) will be developed to test the effectiveness of the product 
recommendation technique, such customer satisfaction error rate and rate of fit with browser 
favor product. It hopes that the achievement of this study can be used as consultation for 
shopping web business building product recommendation system for fashion product 
business. 
 
Keyword: Personalized product recommendation system; E-marketing; customer’s product 
likeness index; Browser activities; Personality traits; Product style. 
Intensive, frequent, and bi-directional communication and information sharing among 
product development teams are two important elements for a successful and 
competitive product development process (Clark & Fujimoto, 1991; Loch & 
Terwiesch, 1998; Nambisan,2002; Banker, et al., 2006), especially true for CPD. CPD 
involving across teams entails a greater number of interfaces and handoffs necessary 
to synchronize information and product design data across team boundaries that could 
not be efficiently fulfilled without information systems and collaboration drivers. 
Thus to achieve true collaborative product development, firms must rely on the use of 
collaboration software, which is usually called collaborative product development 
information systems (CPDIS), to manage and streamline product design and 
development processes that are not well structured or that require significant manual 
intervention, as well as to enable product design teams to collaborate by facilitating 
the sharing of product data used in the design, development, and management of 
products (Welty & Becerra-Fernandez, 2001). However, from socio-technical view, 
the implementation of information systems is not only a technical systems investment 
(Laudon & Laudon, 2007; Orlikowski & Barley, 2001). Information systems success 
needs to recognize the fit between the task and the technology (Goodhue & 
Thompson, 1995). This means that the technology must be changed and designed in 
such a way as to fit organizational and individual needs, and organizations and 
individuals must also be changed through training, learning, and planned 
organizational change to allow the technology to operate and prosper. 
Research in organizational behavior has recognized the importance of leaders to 
coordinate resources, reduce conflict, build team synergy and enhance team 
performance (Yukl, 1998). In CPD project, the impact of inter-organization 
collaborative design teams on the product development process is strongly influenced 
by their leaders (Jassawalla and Sashittal, 2000), especially heavyweight product 
manager (HPM). HPM can play as an integrator and coordinator in managing, guiding, 
and motivating diverse team members toward the common goals and objectives of 
CPD project. However, empirical research that examines the relationship between 
collaborative design team leadership, especially the role of HPM on the 
task-technology fit, computer use and CPD performance has been surprisingly limited 
(Gerwin & Barrowman, 2002; Koufteros et al., 2002; Koufteros & Marcoulide, 2006). 
The technology-to-performance chain (TPC) model developed by Goodhue and 
Thompson (1995) for assessing utilization of the technology and firm performance is 
one recent model gaining popularity and acceptance among information systems 
researchers. They proposed that an explanation of information systems success needs 
to recognize both the task for which the technology is used and the fit between the 
task and the technology.  
To bridge the existing research gap, we extend task-technology fit model by involved 
the role of HPM to study the task-technology fit, computer use and performance in 
collaborative product development. Using product design and development data 
collected from a survey of 205 companies, we empirically test our hypotheses 
regarding the role of HPM impact on the implementation of CPDIS in product 
development. 
We find that HPM has a significant impact on the level of task-technology fit, which 
in turn leads to collaboration among product design teams. Furthermore, 
improvements in the frequency and intensity of collaboration leads to improved 
performance, in terms of reduce engineering change frequencies and product 
development cost, shrink design cycle time and improve product design quality. Our 
primary contribution to the extant literature on product collaboration development is 
technologies are used to augment the capabilities of the individual specialists, and 
enhance the ability of collaborators to interact with each other and with computational 
resources.  
Furthermore, with the globalization of the manufacturing industry, members on a 
collaborative team often work in parallel and independently using different 
engineering tools distributed at separate locations, even across enterprise boundaries 
and across various time zones around the world (Shen, et al., 2008). Thus, CPDIS is 
carried out not only among multidisciplinary product development teams within the 
same company, but also across the boundaries of companies and time zones, support a 
broad range of system-to-system collaboration capabilities for processing of 
structured and unstructured product design data (Nambisan 2003), with increased 
numbers of customers and suppliers involved in the process. 
 
Task-Technology Fit 
The linkage between information technology and performance has been an ongoing 
concern for firms who pursue to adopt a technology to be effective. The 
task–technology fit (TTF) model developed by Goodhue and Thompson (1995), that 
included characteristics of information technology, tasks, and of the individual 
characteristics as explanatory variables for technology use and for individual 
performance is one recent model gaining popularity and acceptance among 
information systems researchers. The TTF model originated from the cognitive fit 
theory of Vessey (1991). Vessey proposed the cognitive fit model from the 
perspective of cognitive cost. The cognitive fit model postulates that a cognitive fit 
between the problem-solving aids and the problem-solving task reduces the 
complexity of the task at hand, thereby improving the problem solving effectiveness. 
The TTF model believes that a fit among the task, technology, and individual 
characteristics positively impacts the adoption of information technology (Goodhue 
and Thompson, 1995; Goodhue, 1998). When the users of technology feel that the 
technology is capable of supporting the task at hand, the users exhibit good 
performance. The ability of the technology to support the task means that the 
functionalities of the technology enable a smooth execution of the task, reduce the 
cost of performing the task, or make the task easily accomplished. The degree of the 
task and technology fit is affected by the interactions among the characteristics of the 
task, the functionalities of the technology, and the personalities of the users. The 
task–technology fit improves when the gap of these three aspects is narrowed. 
Moreover, different characteristics of the task will require support from different 
functionalities of the technology. For example, if the required information of the task 
comes from different organizational units of the company, the technology must have 
the capability of integrating various data sources.  
A common addition to a TTF model is individual abilities. The originally derived TTF 
included a construct of individual abilities. However, recent researchers study in 
which experience with particular information systems is generally associated with 
higher utilization of that information systems (Guinan et al., 1997). In tests of TTF 
model, individual abilities, operationalized as computer literacy, negatively affected 
perceived fit between task and technology (Goodhue, 1995) and, operationalized as 
experience with the particular IT, positively affected computer use (Dishaw & Strong, 
1998). So, a simpler version of the TTF model which drops the construct of individual 
characteristics was shown in Fig. 1. 
with upper management in a language they understand (Pawar et al., 1994) and play 
as an integrator in project (Daft & Lengel, 1986). According to Hershock et al. (1994) 
and Koufteros et al. (2002), the integrator role includes access to relevant information, 
integrate and coordinate activities, reinforce a common vision, devise processes and 
to overcome resistance and, thereby, reduce equivocality about goals and how these 
goals are to be achieved. This helps the product development team develop a shared 
vision and cut across traditional functional boundaries. They also can build the 
organization’s commitment to learning and they have the formal and informal 
authority and personal expertise to support and direct cross-teams. Furthermore, 
heavyweight managers’ access to top management improves their understanding of 
the firm’s strategic situation. This enables early top management consideration and 
buy-in on the product concept, and the alignment of project targets with strategic 
objectives (Koufteros et al., 2002). 
Existing literature on the HPM has highlighted the importance of the formal influence 
(Rauniar, et al., 2008; Wheelwright & Clark, 1992; Schilling & Hill, 1998) and also 
informal influence (Rauniar, et al., 2008; Koufteros & Marcoulide, 2006; Koufteros 
et al., 2002; Wheelwright and Clark, 1992) of such managers on the project and team. 
Based on above literature review, the objective of the current study is to empirically 
investigate the influence of the HPM on facilitating of the task-technology fit and 
computer use in collaborative product development team. 
 
RESEARCH MODEL AND RESEARCH HYPOTHESES 
In this section, we describe our research framework and its hypotheses. 
 
Research Conceptual Framework 
In an environment characterized as rigorous global market competition, global 
operations, rapid technological change as well as shortened product life cycle, 
manufacturing companies have been force to develop new high quality products at an 
increased speed, reduced cost, risk sharing and higher customer satisfaction. Product 
development environments are typically characterized by high levels of both 
uncertainty and equivocality. In this intensive-competitive, high-change and complex 
environment, companies usually strive to seek “integrative structural mechanisms” 
(Koufteros et al., 2002), which product development is characterized by the use of 
collaborative development, heavyweight product managers, and computer use. A 
successful implementation of integrative structural mechanisms needs: a series of new 
strategies, including an efficient communication strategy for a multidisciplinary group 
of people from the design and manufacturing departments to share and exchange ideas 
and comments; an integration organizational environment to link heterogeneous 
software tools in product design, analysis, simulation and manufacturing optimization 
to realize obstacle-free engineering information exchange and sharing; and, an 
interoperability structure to manipulate downstream manufacturing applications as 
services to enable designers to evaluate manufacturability or assembleability as early 
as possible (Shen et al., 2008) Majchrzak et al., (2000) also showed that the 
significant alignments among the technology's structural features, task and 
organizational environment and group's internal structure are necessary to adapt the 
use of a collaborative technology and successfully achieved its collaborative product 
development objectives. 
However, the academic as well as practitioner communities would have a question: 
who and how to shape the technology's structural features and spirit to fit task, 
organizational environment and group's internal structure and facilitate computer 
resort to the use of information technology and computers in order to cope with the 
tasks before them. This shows that each team requires significant amounts of 
information inputs, and in turn, must provide information outputs in a timely manner 
if it is to fulfill its collaborative product design responsibilities. Careful reflection on 
findings reported in the literature review leads to the following hypothesis: 
Hypothesis 1. The CPD tasks needed CPDIS support are associated with an 
improvement in the level of task-technology fit. 
 
To support collaborative design, information and communication technologies are 
used to augment the capabilities of the individual specialists, and enhance the ability 
of collaborators to interact with each other and with computational resources. CPDIS 
is a collection of hardware and software technologies that enables more rapid and 
collaboration activities spanning all product value chain elements among 
multidisciplinary product developers associated with the entire product lifecycle 
(Swink, 2006). CPDIS provides design engineers with customer and product features 
information, existing designs that might meet the design needs (eliminates 
re-inventing the wheel), tooling requirements and availability of existing tools 
(process capabilities), sources of parts and components (unique vs. off-the-shelf items) 
to compress the overall product development time. The CPDIS serves as the structure 
for efficient data storage, electronic retrieval, reuse of product designs and share 
on-line documents, thereby eliminating the need for team members to re-enter data 
and recreate drawings. It can enable collaborative design and engineering by allowing 
designers to synchronize product and process development using virtual prototyping 
tools, and share design ideas between team members electronically and conduct 
real-time version control, which enables engineers to track design defects and 
implement design changes more efficiently. A CPDIS can facilitate engineering 
changes by sharing critical data electronically with both internal and external partners. 
It can also be used to track, manage and communicate overall project status to all 
collaborators as well as to project portfolio managers and business planners (Swink, 
2006). Hence, CPDIS influences the richness of product design collaboration by 
facilitating faster information transfer, eliminating redundancies, revising task 
interdependencies, synchronous communication within and across product 
development teams, and allowing for concurrency between different tasks (Banker, et 
al., 2006). Careful reflection on findings reported in the literature review leads to the 
following hypothesis: 
Hypothesis 2. The CPDIS suitable for CPD tasks are associated with an improvement 
in the level of task-technology fit. 
 
Heavyweight product managers 
Top management support has been recognized as a key factor in facilitating the 
synchronization of business strategy and information systems functional strategy 
(Lederer and Mendelow, 1988). The alignment of information systems functions and 
CDP project task may be difficult, if not impossible, without a product development 
manager who has sufficient influence and top management support to make decisions 
that cut across functions. HPMs are usually senior managers in the organization 
(Koufteros et al., 2002). They can effectively communicate with upper management 
in a language they understand (Pawar et al., 1994), play as an integrator in project 
(Daft and Lengel, 1986), and directly response to top management for all the work 
done by the product development team (Wheelwright and Clark, 1992). Such product 
development project managers provide objective advice to the team about emergent 
technology-to performance model can explain performance for both mandatory and 
voluntary use settings, and organizational performance (Karim et al., 2007; Zigurs and 
Buckland, 1998). Different aspects of TTF have been confirmed relevant for 
information systems in general (Ferratt and Vlahos 1998; Goodhue 1998), as well as 
for specific technologies (Chang, 2008; Dishaw and Strong , 1999; Goodhue et al. 
2000), and for a variety of tasks (McGill and Klobas, 2009; Lee, et al., 
2007; ,Majchrzak et al., 2005; Staples and Seddon 2004). Continuing the TTF 
proposition, this study revalidates constituent relationships in the context of CPDIS 
with the following hypotheses: 
H5. Fitness of task and IT features will have a positive effect on utilization of CPDIS.  
H6. Fitness of task and IT features will have a positive effect on collaborative product 
design performance. 
H7. Utilization of CPDIS will have a positive effect on collaborative product design 
performance.

Tests of the Structural Model  
After assessing the measurement model, the structural equation model was used to the 
hypothesized relationships among the research variables; see Fig. 3 As the first step in 
assessing the hypothesized relationships, the structural equation model was evaluated 
by examining the (1)χ2, (2) fit indices. The results indicated that the χ2 was 241.48 
with 160 degrees of freedom (P=0.00003), thereby showing an insignificant χ2. Since 
sample size heavily influences the chi-square (Bollen and Long, 1993), researchers 
have suggested other goodness-of-fit indices to assist in the model evaluation 
(Joreskog and Sorbom, 1996). Thus, the recommendations in the literature suggest a 
more complete examination of the fit indices. For the hypothesized model (see Table 
6), the χ2/df was 1.49, less than the standard of 3 suggested by Bentler and Bonett 
(1989); the GFI was 0.89, a value exceeding the standard of 0.8 recommended by 
Hair et al. (2006); the AGFI was 0.86, a value exceeding the standard of 0.8 
recommended by Scott (1994); the RMSEA was 0.05, within the suggested standard 
(less 0.8) by Hair et al. (2006); the NFI was 0.97, the NNFI was 0.99, and the CFI was 
0.99, exceeding the standard of 0.9 recommended by Brown and Cudeck (1993). To 
summarize, these indicators are consistent in indicating an acceptable fit of the 
hypothesized model to the data.

CONCLUSIONS 
The increasing competition and complexity of products and processes require new 
organizational concepts for product development. Collaborative product development 
deals with the sharing of various interests and resources among various actors with 
the aim of reaching a common purpose. It is claimed that collaborative product design 
involves mass cross-functional information interchange and knowledge sharing that 
could not be efficiently fulfilled without information systems and collaboration 
drivers. The academic as well as practitioner communities would have a question: 
who and how to shape the technology's structural features and spirit to fit task, 
organizational environment and group's internal structure and facilitate computer 
usage to execute CPD project tasks? It is important to know for example whether 
HPMs have catalytic effects. Do they have a positive impact on the fitness between 
information technology and collaborative design task, and facilitate computer usage? 
Would those practices have in turn a positive impact on the performance of 
collaborative product development? There is relatively little empirical research in this 
area. On the base of task-technology fit model and using product design and 
development data collected from a survey of 205 companies, this study empirically 
test hypotheses regarding the role of HPM impact on the implementation of 
collaborative product development information systems in product development. The 
results indicate that HPM has a significant impact on the level of task-technology fit, 
which in turn leads to computer use among product design teams, and finally 
significant positive impact on engineering change frequencies and development cost, 
product quality and design cycle time. The extent to which a firm uses a HPM 
strategy seems to be an important contextual variable that affects the nature of the 
relationships among product development practices and performance. Firms operating 
in competitive and equivocal environments appear to adopt higher levels of integrated 
product development practices.
