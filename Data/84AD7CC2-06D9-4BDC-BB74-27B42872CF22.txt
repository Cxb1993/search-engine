results converged undesirably when the incident 
wavelength is larger than the hill width; moreover, 
they distorted severely when the hill width is larger 
than four times the incident wavelength.  
In the present work, a twofold objective is pursued. 
On one hand, the author intends to derive a novel 
series solution to the scattering problem of SH waves 
by a semi-elliptic mountain. The appropriate usage 
of the region-matching technique is the key to the 
solution. On the other hand, the author expects to 
find the similar phenomena of ‘geometric’ focusing 
in such a case. 
The criterion of classification terms for the ‘lower’ 
and ‘higher’ topographies depends on the aspect 
ratio of convex surface (height to half width). When 
this ratio is equal to one, the landform turns into a 
semi-circular convex surface. When the topography 
height is lower than that of the semi-circular case, 
this is classified as a ‘lower’ case; otherwise it is as a 
‘higher’ case (i.e. the aspect ratio is larger than one).  
2 THEORETICAL FORMULATIONS 
2.1  Lower cases 
Consider an infinitely long, lower, semi-elliptic, 
convex topography lies over a homogeneous, 
isotropic, linearly elastic half-plane (with shear 
modulus   and shear wave velocity sc ). An infinite 
train of unit-amplitude plane SH waves (with 
angular frequency  ) is incident upon this 
topography at an angle   to the x-axis. The 
geometric layout of the problem is illustrated in Fig. 
1. The half-width, height and half-focal length of 
convex topography are a , h  and b , respectively.  
As seen in Fig. 1, through introducing a 
semi-elliptic auxiliary boundary aS , the half-space 
is divided into two regions, an open region (1) and an 
enclosed region (2). In these two regions, the 
steady-state out-of-plane motions are required to 
satisfy the governing Helmholtz equations, namely

where / sk c  is the shear wave number. The 
subscripts, 1 and 2, designate the total displacement 
field in regions (1) and (2), respectively. The 
time-harmonic factor exp( )i t  is suppressed in all 
the expressions throughout this paper.

When the above coefficients nA  and nB  are 
obtained, nC  and nD  can be determined via eqs (21) 
and (22). 
It is convenient to define the dimensionless 
(a) 60    
(b) 90    
Fig. 3. Surface motions versus /x a  for / 0.3h a 
and 0.7 with 5.0   at 60    and 90 . 
  –6–
incident cases ( 90   ), the focus of focusing 
region is certainly on the central axis of convex 
topography (i.e. y-axis). Therefore, to exhibit the 
potential geometric focusing, Figs 4(a) and 4(b) give 
the spectral variations in underground motion along 
the y-axis for / 0.3h a   and 0.7, respectively. 
As seen in Fig. 4(a), the focusing regions locate at 
about / 0.3y a   , while in Fig. 4(b), they occur at 
about 0 / 0.4y a   and shift downward slightly 
with increasing frequency. One can find that the 
focusing intensity for / 0.7h a   is higher than that 
for / 0.3h a  . Such a case of / 0.7h a   is indeed 
capable of converging wave energy and producing 
high amplification, which can reach over two times 
of that for free-field response. Besides, the 
amplification seems to increase with increasing 
frequency within the range of calculated values. This 
feature consists with that given by Davis et al. (2000) 
for ‘geologic’ focusing. 
To further explore the influence of geometric 
focusing on underground motion, the near-field 
displacement distributions for / 0.7h a   with    
7.5 at 30    and 90  (selected from Fig. 4b) are 
given in Fig. 5. As observed in Fig. 5, the subsurface 
wavefields converge to a localized region obviously. 
In Fig. 5(b), the amplification can be up to about 2.5 
times of that for free-field response. Except the 
vertically incident cases, it is not easy to predict the 
focal positions under oblique incidence, which may 
depend on the incident frequency, the angle of 
incidence and the mountain height. 
 
3.2  Higher cases 
Fig. 6 shows the surface motions against the 
dimensionless distance /y a  for / 2.0h a   with 
 0.5 and 2.0 at 30    and 90 . As seen in Fig. 6, 
the motion patterns on the left-hand HGS and 
mountain surface become more complex as the 
dimensionless frequency increases. In Fig. 6(a), the
