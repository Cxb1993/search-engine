Abstract 
Based on the author’s previous study, new 
results of antiplane singularity orders at the 
apex of the magneto-electro-elastic wedge- 
junction composite structure have been obtained 
in this paper. The electromagnetic field in the 
air is considered in this model. The 
characteristic equation and numerical results are 
obtained for discussions. The results of this 
paper are compared with those of bimaterial 
magneto-electro-elastic wedge in our previous 
study. As a result, the existence of the air plays 
an important role to reduce the singularity when 
the permittivity or permeability of the solid 
approaches that of the air. The diversity of 
singularity orders between the bimaterial wedge 
and the wedge-junction becomes larger when 
the difference between the volume fractions of 
both magneto-electro- elastic materials is larger. 
This wedge-junction model is more realistic and 
shows the important role of the electromagnetic 
field in the air. This paper provides guidelines 
for the designs of actuators, sensors and other 
composite structures. 
Keywords:  magneto-electro-elastic; wedge- 
junction; singularity orders; antiplane; air. 
 
1. Introduction 
In recent years, many studies dedicate 
efforts to the field of the magneto-electro-elastic 
(MEE) composite materials. This special 
material, e.g. the BaTiO3−CoFe2O4 composite, 
composes of piezoelectric and piezomagnetic 
materials. Magneto-electro-elastic coupling 
effects of this MEE material perform the 
magnetic, electric and mechanical energy 
conversion so that it can be applied on the 
design of sensors, actuators and smart structures. 
For electromagnetic transient problems, the 
MEE material exhibits a new material property, 
i.e. the magnetoelectric coupling effect which 
does not exist in pure piezoelectric or 
piezomagnetic materials.    
In the early 1970s, the BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 
composite was first produced to perform the 
MEE properties [1-3]. Since 1990s, the material 
science, physics, mechanics, coupling fields, 
productions and applications of the MEE 
composite materials have been studied by many 
researchers [4-19]. The BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 
particulate composite is a typical MEE material. 
This composite material can compose of the 
piezoelectric BaTiO3 inclusions and the 
piezomagnetic CoFe2O4 matrix. During the 
production procedure, it can be polarized to be 
transversely isotropic by external electric and 
magnetic fields [5,7]. With different volume 
fractions of the inclusions, the material property 
of the composite can be changed to fit the 
design purpose of the electronic product.  
In the last decade, most theoretical studies 
for the MEE composites were focused on the 
micromechanics [7], multiphysical fields 
[10-11], plate problems [12] and fracture 
mechanics [13-17]. Very recently, the antiplane 
singularity problems of the MEE wedges in

where p is a complex transform parameter and

)(sin2 βα pp + =0 is obtained due to the 
mathematical condition )(11
aε = )(11aΓ =0, which is 
an artificial condition for deleting the air in the 
analysis. In fact, the permittivity and 
permeability of the air have non-zero values. 
According to [22], Eq. (26) can be ignored for 
discussions of singularities.

When the piezoelectric effects are also 
removed, Eq. (25) can be reduced to the 
following equations:

From above results, the magnetic, electric and 
elastic fields are uncoupled respectively into 
Eqs. (24), (27) and (28). This result is identical 
to the that of Chue and Chen [22] or Ma and 
Hour [21]. 
 
5. Numerical results and discussions 
The roots of the characteristic equation (22) 
could be real or complex, and may be multiple 
roots. The singularity order λ−1 is determined 
by λ= –p, where p is the root by solving Eq. (22) 
numerically. The strongest singularity order 
from Eq. (22), which the absolute value λ−1 
is the maximum, dominates the singular fields.   
 
5.1  Material constants 
The material constants of the typical MEE 
material, BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 composite, are 
adopted for numerical calculations. Table 1 lists 
the material constants of BaTiO3 and CoFe2O4 
[7,14]. The positive permeability, Γ11= 590×10-6 
Ns2/C2, is assigned to CoFe2O4 in numerical 
calculations. However, the negative 
permeability of CoFe2O4 used in many past 
studies is not adopted in this paper. The 
electromagnetic handbook [24] indicates that 
the magnetic permeability of ferrimagnetic 
materials such as CoFe2O4 should be positive.  
The composite properties of the MEE 
material containing BaTiO3 inclusions and 
CoFe2O4 matrix are obtained according to the 
macroscopic mixture rule [14]: 
)1( f
M
ijf
I
ij
C
ij VV −+= κκκ  (29) 
where Vf is the volume fraction of BaTiO3 
inclusion. The superscripts C, I and M represent 
the composite, inclusion and matrix, 
respectively. The effective material constant C
ijκ  
stands for the material constant )(i
ijc , )(iije , )(iijq , 
)(i
ijε , )(iijΓ  or )(iijλ .  
In additions, the permittivity and 
permeability of the air (almost equal to those in 
vacuum) are: =)(11aε 8.85×10-12 C/ Vm and 
=Γ )(11a 1.2566×10-6 Ns2/C2. 
 
5.2  Effects of permittivity or permeability  
In this section, the volume fractions of 
MEE material 1 and 2 are )1(fV =0.5 and 
)2(
fV =0.2 respectively. To investigate the effects 
of permittivity or permeability on the singularity 
orders, the permittivity or permeability of MEE 
material 2 is adjusted artificially. The material 
constants are changed to be )2(111εκ  and )2(112Γκ , 
where κ1 and κ2 are scaling ratios. The 
numerical results of the bimaterial wedge from 
[18] and the wedge-junction in this paper are 
compared as follows.  
Figures 2 and 3 show the effects of κ1 on 
strongest singularity orders for different wedge 
angles. Both figures show that the difference 
between the bimaterial wedge and the 
wedge-junction becomes larger when κ1 is small. 
Both curves in Fig. 3 almost overlap when κ1 is 
larger but the diversity of both curves in Fig. 2 
is obvious. In Fig. 2, the singularity of the 
wedge-junction reduces rapidly when κ1 
approaches 0.01. In this case, the permittivity of 
MEE material 2 approaches that of the air. It 
causes the three-materials electromagnetic 
junction (e.g. Fig. 1c) tends to be a bimaterial 
electromagnetic junction so that the singularity 
reduces obviously. Figures 4 and 5 show the 
effects of κ2 and the results are similar to Fig. 2 
and 3. In Fig. 2 to 5, the strongest singularity 
orders are all real, i.e. Re[λ-1]. No imaginary 
part exists. 
Above results show the existence of the air 
plays an important role to reduce the singularity 
when the permittivity or permeability of the 
solid approaches that of the air.  
 
5.3  Effects of wedge angles 
Figure 6 plots the variations of strongest 
singularity orders of the bimaterial wedge [18] 
and the wedge-junction with different wedge 
 7
singularity when the permittivity or 
permeability of the solid approaches that of the 
air. The diversity of singularity orders between 
the bimaterial wedge [18] and the 
wedge-junction becomes larger when the 
difference between the volume fractions of both 
magneto-electro-elastic materials is larger. 
Although the wedge-junction model 
investigates the lower singularity for specified 
situations, the bimaterial wedge model used in 
[18,19] still provides conservative design 
guidelines for sensors or actuators. Of course, 
the wedge-junction model is more realistic and 
shows the important role of the electromagnetic 
field in the air. This paper provides guidelines 
for the designs of actuators, sensors and other 
composite structures.

ON THE SINGULARITIES OF MAGNETO-ELECTRO-ELASTIC 
WEDGE-JUNCTION STRUCTURES IN SENSORS OR ACTUATORS∗

In this paper, the antiplane singularity orders at the apex of the magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) 
wedge-junction structure in sensors or actuators have been studied. The analytical model consists of 
three separated regions: two magneto-electro-elastic solids and the air. The model considers the 
electromagnetic field in the air. The results of this paper are compared with those of the bimaterial 
magneto-electro-elastic wedge in our previous study. The numerical results show that the existence 
of the air plays an important role to reduce the singularity order when the permittivity or 
permeability of the MEE solid approaches that of the air.   
1 Introduction 
The magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) material performs the piezoelectric/piezomagnetic 
properties [1-6]. The typical MEE material, BaTiO3−CoFe2O4 composite, composes of 
the piezoelectric and piezomagnetic materials. Magneto-electro-elastic coupling effects 
of this MEE material perform the magnetic, electric and mechanical energy conversion 
so that it can be applied on the design of sensors, actuators and smart structures. 
The singularity phenomenon of the MEE wedge or junction is that the stress, electric 
and magnetic fields may become theoretically infinite due to the geometrical or material 
discontinuities at the wedge or junction apex, e.g. sharp corners or interfaces in sensors 
or actuators as shown in Fig. 1(a) [7,8]. The mechanical failure and dielectric breakdown 
frequently initiate from the wedge or junction apex due to the singular stress and electric 
field. 
Recently, the singularity problem of the bimaterial MEE wedge has been studied in 
previous papers [7,8] but the portion of the air (or vacuum) was neglected. In this paper, 
the electromagnetic field in the air (or vacuum) is taken into account so that it is 
modelled as a magneto-electro-elastic wedge-junction structure in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). 
This consideration makes a three-materials electromagnetic junction including two MEE 
materials and the air (Fig. 1c), and a bimaterial magneto-electro-elastic wedge (Fig. 1d). 
Using analytical methods, the purpose of this paper is to study the singularity at the 
wedge-junction apex under antiplane deformation. The results will be compared with 
those in [7]. Effects of the existence of the air will be discussed. For the design of MEE 
actuators or sensors, this paper provides guidelines for the selections of wedge angles 
and materials to reduce the singularity and prevent from damage.

The superscript i denotes materials 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 1(b). The material constants 
c44, ε11, e15, Γ11, q15 and λ11 are the elastic stiffness constant, dielectric constant 
(permittivity), piezoelectric coefficient, magnetic permeability, piezomagnetic coefficient 
and the magnetoelectric coefficient, respectively. For electrostatic and magnetostatic 
analyses, the magnetoelectric coefficient λ11 is zero. The field quantities in Eq. (1a) are 
shear stresses (σrz, σθz), shear strains (γrz, γθz), displacement (w), electric displacements 
(Dr, Dθ), electric fields (Er, Eθ), electric potential (φ ), magnetic inductions (Br, Bθ), 
magnetic fields (Hr, Hθ) and the magnetic potential (ψ ). In this study, the antiplane 
elastic field couples with inplane electric and magnetic fields.  
For the electromagnetic junction in Fig. 1(c), the electrostatic and magnetostatic 
fields in the air are not neglected. The field equations in the air are as follows:

where i=a denotes parameters in the air. Also, λ11 is set to be zero.  
It is noted that the model in Fig. 1(b) combines the three-materials electromagnetic 
junction (Fig. 1c) and bimaterial MEE wedge (Fig. 1d) using Eqs. (1a) and (1b). The 
model in Fig. 1(b) is considered as a MEE wedge-junction structure. 
Without considering body forces, free electric charges and magnetic charges, the 
force equilibrium equation, the Maxwell equations, the shear strain-displacement, electric 
field-electric potential, and magnetic field-magnetic potential relations can be obtained. 
Then the governing equations for the static antiplane problem (λ11 = 0) are as follows:

where ∇2 is two-dimensional Laplace operator in (r,θ ) coordinate. Solving for w, φ and 
ψ  from Eqs. (2), we have the following solutions for w, φ, and ψ :

 θθψ ppCppCa sin)(cos)( 1615)( +=  (10h) 
where Ci (i = 1, 2, 3, … , 16) are unknown functions of p. 
The shear stresses, electric displacements and magnetic inductions have rλ−1 type 
singularities [7,11] at the wedge-junction apex (point O in Fig. 1b), i.e. 
 1−∝ λσ r ,  1−∝ λrD ,  1−∝ λrB  (11) 
where λ−1 is called the singularity order. The real part of λ−1 should satisfy the 
following condition for bounded values of the displacement, electric potential and 
magnetic potential: 
 0]1Re[1 <−<− λ  (12) 
From the definitions of Eqs. (6), it needs 0]1Re[1 <−−<− p  with –p = λ [7,11].  
3 Edge Conditions and Characteristic Equation 
In Fig. 1(b), the continuity conditions at the perfectly bonded interface denoted as x-axis 
(θ=0o) are: 
 )0,()0,( )2()1( pwpw = ,  )0,()0,( )2()1( pp φφ = ,  )0,()0,( )2()1( pp ψψ =  (13a) 
 )0,()0,( )2()1( pp zz θθ σσ = ,  )0,()0,( )2()1( pDpD θθ = ,  )0,()0,( )2()1( pBpB θθ =  (13b) 
The edge conditions (boundary and continuity conditions) on the wedge edges at θ = α 
and θ = −β  are as follows: (a) the edge is free of traction; (b) the electric displacement 
and magnetic induction normal to the edge are continuous on the edge (solid-air 
interface); (c) the electric potential and magnetic potential are continuous on the edge. 
Above conditions are:  
 0),()1( =ασ θ pz  , ),(),( )()1( αα θθ pDpD a=  , ),(),( )()1( αφαφ pp a=   
 ),(),( )()1( αα θθ pBpB a= ,  ),(),( )()1( αψαψ pp a=   (14a) 
 0),()2( =−βσ θ pz  , ),(),( )()2( ββ θθ −=− pDpD a  , ),(),( )()2( βφβφ −=− pp a  
 ),(),( )()2( ββ θθ −=− pBpB a ,  ),(),( )()2( βψβψ −=− pp a   (14b) 
 Since most edge conditions of the wedge-junction structures in sensors and actuators are 
free of tractions, only the singularity orders under Eqs. (14) are discussed. However, 
many past studies discussed the fixed edge condition, i.e. w(j)=0 (j=1,2), on θ = α or 
θ = −β. But this fixed-displacement condition is not adaptive on the solid-air interface of 
the wedge-junction structure.

In additions, the permittivity and permeability of the air (almost equal to those in 
vacuum) are: =)(11aε 8.85×10-12 C/ Vm and =Γ )(11a 1.2566×10-6 Ns2/C2. 
4.2. Effects of Permittivity or Permeability on the Singularity 
To investigate the effects of permittivity or permeability on the singularity orders, the 
permittivity or permeability of MEE material 2 is adjusted artificially. The original 
volume fractions of MEE material 1 and 2 are )1(
fV =0.5 and )2(fV =0.2 respectively. The 
material constants of MEE material 2 are changed artificially to be )2(111εκ  and )2(112Γκ , 
where κ1 and κ2 are scaling factors.  
The results of the bimaterial wedge from [7] and the wedge-junction in this paper 
are compared as follows. Figure 2 depicts values of the strongest singularity orders of 
Re[λ−1] versus different κ1. Both figures show that the difference between the results of 
the bimaterial wedge (in ref. [7]) and the wedge-junction (in this paper) becomes larger 
when κ1 is smaller. In Fig. 2(a), the singularity of the wedge-junction reduces rapidly 
when κ1 approaches 0.01. In this case, the permittivity of MEE material 2 approaches that 
of the air. It causes the three-materials electromagnetic junction (e.g. Fig. 1c) tends to be 
like a bimaterial electromagnetic junction so that the singularity reduces obviously. Both 
curves in Fig. 2(b) almost overlap when κ1 is larger but the diversity of both curves in Fig. 
2(a) is obvious. 
Figure 3 shows the effects of κ2 and the results are similar to Fig. 2. In Fig. 2 and 3, 
the strongest singularity orders are all real.  
The results show that the existence of the air plays an important role to reduce the 
singularity when the permittivity or permeability of the solid approaches that of the air. 
The electromagnetic field in the air has its effects on the singularity at the wedge-
junction apex.
