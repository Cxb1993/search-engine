1. 研究摘要
Effect of thermal treatments on the structural and electrical properties of the chemical bath
deposition derived ZnO thin films with various Ti additions are studied. XRD results show that
the annealed Ti-doped ZnO films with wurtzite structure are randomly oriented. Crystallite
structure, carrier concentration, resistivity and mobility are found to be dependent on the
treatment temperature. At a treatment temperature of 100°C, the 2 at% Ti-doped ZnO film
possesses a carrier concentration of 2.5×1020 cm-3, a resistivity of 2.8×10-3 Ω-cm, and a mobility
of 12 cm2/Vs.
2. 技術研發成果與技術特點說明：
Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers have been studied extensively because of their
broad range of applications which include use as transparent electrodes in photovoltaic and in
display devices [1, 2]. Zinc oxide is one of the versatile and technologically important
semiconducting material because of its typical properties such as resistivity control over the range
10-3 to 105 Ω cm [3], transparency in the visible range, high-electrochemical stability, direct
bandgap (3.37 eV), and absence of toxicity etc. It crystallizes in a wurtzite structure and exhibits
n-type conductivity [4]. Stoichiometric ZnO films are highly resistive, but less resistive films can
be made either by creating oxygen vacancies, which act as donors or by doping with Al, Ga or In
[5]. ZnO is one of the semiconductor having good chemical stability against hydrogen plasma [6]
and suitable for photovoltaic applications because of its high-electrical conductivity and optical
transmittance in the visible region of the solar spectrum [7], which is prime important in solar cell
fabrications. Thin films of ZnO can be used as a window layer as well as one of the electrodes in
solar cells [6].
Different chemical methods such as chemical bath deposition (CBD) [8, 9], spray pyrolysis
[10], successive ionic layer adsorption and deposition (SILAR) [11], electrodeposition [12,13],
etc. have been used to obtain ZnO films. As compared to other deposition methods, CBD also
referred to as solution deposition method, has its own advantages such as simplicity,
reproducibility, non-hazardous, cost effectiveness, etc. The CBD method is well suited for
producing large-area thin films. This method is low temperature method and it does not require
sophisticated instruments. It involves deposition of semiconductor thin films on substrates that
are kept in the aqueous solutions.
However, Ti-doped ZnO thin film fabricated using the CBD method was not clearly discussed.
In this work, a procedure that improves the efficiency of the CBD method during the growth of
the Ti-doped ZnO films is presented. By means of this procedure, the precipitation process occurs
only upon the glass substrate. Results of the structural, electrical and morphological
characterizations of the films with different Ti additions and treatment temperatures are also
presented.
Figure 1 illustrates XRD patterns of Ti-doped ZnO films on glass (Coring 7059) substrate. It
can be seen that as-deposited Ti-doped ZnO films exhibit good crystallinity corresponding to the
We have measured the carrier concentration, resistivity and mobility to observe the effect of
thermal treatment on the transport properties of Ti-doped ZnO films. Hall measurements show
that all the films are n-type. The plot of variation of carrier concentration and mobility with
temperature for the films treated in air are shown in Fig. 3. It shows a sharp increase in carrier
concentration when the temperature is changed from 100 to 300oC in air. Above these
temperatures, the carrier concentration decreases to a lower value as the temperature increases.
Generally, the formula of Ti-doped ZnO can be written as Zn1+xO implying the presence of
defects, such as oxygen vacancy (VO), zinc interstitials (Zni), etc. When it is further annealed
after the formation, zinc interstitial reacts with oxygen to form ZnO (new ZnO-like structure).
Therefore, above 100oC temperature (Fig. 3), the decrease in carrier concentration is probably
ascribed to the reformation of new ZnO like structure [15].
The change in mobility is inconsistent with the treatment temperature and is not understood
now (in Fig. 3). The transport property measurements show that the temperature at which carrier
concentration in the treated films attain a highest value and the resistivity attain a lowest value, is
close to the decomposition temperature.
