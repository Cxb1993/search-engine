collision and thus maintain a high network throughput. 
 
II. System Model 
Consider a M4 system consisting of K  base stations (BS) each with nT  transmit 
antennas and M  mobile stations (MS) each with nR  receive antennas. Assume a 
flat-fading wireless channel with Wk,m  clusters of multipaths are presented between BS 
k  and MS m.  The channel matrix can be expressed as  
( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( )( ), , , , ,, , R R, , T T, ,

k m k mW r w
k m k m k mH
k m w p w p w p

where  represents the number of multipaths in the ( ),k mr w wth  cluster, ( ),,k mw pβ  is a 
complex Gaussian random variable representing the complex fading amplitude of the 
multipath,  denotes the ( )( ,R R, ,k mw pθa ) R 1n ×  receive antenna array response vector of the 
pth  multipath of the wth  cluster with respect to the direction of arrival (DOA) ( ),R, , ,
k m

which is assumed a Gaussian random variable with its center DOA  as its mean 
and its receive angular spread 
( ,

( ),

transmit antenna array vector with respect to the direction of departure (DOD) ( ),T, ,
k m
w pθ  
which is also assumed a Gaussian random variable with its center DOD  as its 
mean and its transmit angular spread 
( ),

( ),

wσ  as its variance. 
Let us consider those propragation environments where there is strong key hole effect or 
environments where thers is few scatters. The channel matrix in (1) becomes rank 
deficient which may reduces the number of available independent subchannels in the 
MIMO channel of any transmit-receive pair in the network and hence greatly degrades 
the system throughput. In order to maintain a high data throughput in such scenarios, in 
the proposed M4 system, each MS can request data transmission from multiple BSs. Let  
denote the set of BSs having communication links, desired or undesired, with MS mκ m,  
the signal received at MS m  can be expressed as 
, ,
m
m k m k
k κ∈= + m∑y H x z  (2) 
where  ym   is the signal vector of size R 1n ×  received by the antenna array at MS m,  
xk  denotes the  transmit signal vector of BS T 1n × k,  and zm  is the additive white 
Gaussian noise (AWGN). For convenience, we ignore the sampling time index in (2) and 
the rest of our analysis. 
In a downlink channel, the transmit signal xk  carrys information intended for several 
 2
channels to the MS  into a set of MISO channels and apply Tomlinson 
Harashima precoder (THP) as the transmit encoding function for data transmission.

3.1. Iterative Receive Beamforming (IRB) 
In the trainning stage, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion is employed to 
design the receive beamformers. At the very beginning, with no knowledge of the receive 
beamformers, each BS  sends the largest mk κ∈ Uk ,m  right singular vectors of Hk,m,  
modulated by the trainning symbols as its transmit signal vectors. In the nth  iteration, 
the weight vector of the uth  MMSE beamformer at MS m  intended for receiving the 
uth  symbol from BS k  is  
[ ] [ ] [ ]1, , ,u uk m m k mn n−=w R p n  (4) 
where [ ] [ ] [ ]Hm m mn E n n=R y y , with [ ]m ny  denoting the receive signal in (2)  
within the time span of the nth  iteration, is the covariance matrix of the signal received 
by the MS m′ s antenna array, the superscript H  represents the complex conjugated 
transpose operation, [ ] [ ], ,u um k m k mn E n t=p y  is the cross correlation vector between the 
receive signal [ ]m ny  and the trainning symbol  At the end of each iteration, the 
weight vectors of the receive beamformers will be fed back to the associated BSs and 
help decide the transmit signals in the next iteration. Different transmit signals thus make

[ ]m nR  and [ ],um k np  in (4) vary with the iterations going on. With the fedback weight 
vectors, BS k  regards the uth  subchannel to MS m  as a MISO channel as  
[ ]( ) [ ]( ), ,1 ,T Hu uk m k m k mn n+ =h w ,  H  (5) 
where the superscript T  denotes the matrix transpose operation. By stacking all the 
MISO channels (5) each as a row vector into a matrix form, the downlink channels 
observed by BS k  can be reconfigured as
