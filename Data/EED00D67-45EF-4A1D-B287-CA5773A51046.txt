英文摘要 
This paper is a critical evaluation of the interpretation criteria of drilled shafts under axial 
compression loading. A wide variety of load test data are used for analysis, and these data 
are divided into drained and undrained databases. The interpretation criteria are examined 
from these load test results to establish a consistent compression interpretation criterion. 
Among these criteria, the range of each interpretation method presents approximately the 
same trend for both drained and undrained conditions. The statistical results show that the 
smaller the compression displacement, the higher the coefficient of variation is. Moreover, 
the undrained load test results reveal less variability than the drained results. The 
load-displacement curve of a drained loading also demonstrates more ductility than that 
for undrained loading. Based on these analyses, the relative merits and interrelationships 
of these criteria are established, and specific design recommendations for the 
interpretation of compression drilled shaft load test, in terms of both capacity and 
displacement, are given.

Introduction 
Owing to uncertainties in geotechnical parameters, construction factors, analytical models, 
and other variables, the capacity of a drilled shaft often needs to be verified using a load 
test. Load-displacement curves obtained from axial load tests on drilled shaft foundations 
can exhibit any one of three shapes, as shown in Fig. 1. The peak of curve A and the 
asymptote of curve B clearly define the maximum resistance of the foundation. However, 
if the load-displacement curve resembles C, the maximum resistance of the foundation is 
not clearly defined. Unfortunately, many drilled foundation load tests resemble curve C, 
hence the “capacity” needs to be evaluated based on the load test results, with “interpreted 
failure load” as a consequence. 
 
Dozens of interpretation criteria (e.g., van der Veen 1953; Terzaghi and Peck 1967; Fuller 
and Hoy 1970; DeBeer 1970; Chin 1970; Davisson 1972; O’Rourke and Kulhawy 1985; 
Hirany and Kulhawy 1988, 1989, 2002) have been proposed to interpret the failure load of 
axial compression tests on deep foundations. Table 1 lists eight representative 
interpretation criteria and their definitions for axial compression capacity. These criteria 
are based on a variety of assumptions, some of which are influenced by individual 
 
Tables 2 and 3 summarize the basic information and interpreted capacities for the drained 
and undrained load tests, respectively. Table 4 lists the sources of all load test case 
histories. Some sources in Table 4 are not presented in detail because they can be 
cross-referred from other published reports (Kulhawy, et al 1983; Chen and Kulhawy 
1994). From these tables, it is apparent that these load tests have been conducted in 
various soil types around the world at various times. For convenience, the ranges of 
foundation geometry, compression capacity, and their coefficient of variation (COV), 
which is the standard deviation (SD) divided by the mean value, are summarized in Table 
5. Evidently, the range of geometry is broad, and the shaft dimension and capacity for the 
drained and undrained load tests are roughly comparable. 
 
Interpreted Axial Compression Capacities 
Eight interpretation criteria were used for evaluation and are listed in Table 1. These 
criteria were selected because they present a wide distribution of interpreted results from 
the lower, middle, and higher ranges. In addition, these criteria include various 
interpretation bases, as noted in Table 1. Therefore, they can be considered as 
representative for the evaluation of existing compression interpretation criteria. 
 
Among the eight criteria, the interpreted capacities of van der Veen (1953) and Chin (1970) 
are based on mathematical models which correspond to the asymptote of the 
load-displacement curve. In contrast, Terzaghi and Peck (1967), DeBeer (1970), and Fuller 
and Hoy (1970) defined the interpreted capacity by an absolute settlement, function of 
shaft diameter, or rate of settlement with respect to load. The Davisson (1972) method, on 
the other hand, is a graphical construction that uses the elastic compression line and an 
offset. A subsequent study by O’Rourke and Kulhawy (1985), which is referred to as the 
slope tangent method, proposed the use of the initial slope instead of an elastic line 
because it is too steep at lower length/diameter ratios of drilled foundations. Finally, the 
L1-L2 method, proposed by Hirany and Kulhawy (1988, 1989, 2002), is also a graphical 
construction. In this method, the load-displacement curve can generally be simplified into 
three distinct regions: initial linear, curve transition, and final linear, as illustrated in Fig. 2. 
Point L1 in the figure corresponds to the load (QL1) and butt displacement (ρL1) at the end 
of the initial linear region, while point L2 corresponds to the load (QL2) and butt 
displacement (ρL2) at the initiation of the final linear region. The end of the initial linear 
region is the elastic limit, whereas the beginning of the final linear region is the failure 
threshold. The QL2 is defined as the interpreted capacity because the load beyond QL2, 
though a small increase in load, gives a significant increase in displacement. 
 
the COV that appears, with the Davisson, slope tangent, 4%B, and Fuller and Hoy 
methods having a relatively lower COV to L2. Among these low COV’s interpretation 
methods, 4%B and Fuller and Hoy have more load test cases that failed to interpret 
capacity, as can be seen in Tables 2 and 6. The reason for Q4%B is due to a larger 
displacement required for the load test, while for Fuller and Hoy, it is attributable to its 
individual definition. For that reason, these two criteria occasionally are inapplicable on an 
interpretation situation. In contrast, with their low COV and interpretation applicability, 
the Davisson, slope tangent, and L2 are considered as more suitable methods, with Q4%B 
conveniently treated as L2 for engineering practice. 
 
Table 7 shows the mean compression displacements that correspond to each interpretation 
criterion. The order of these displacements is the same as that for the capacities, from 
DeBeer to Chin, with ρ values from 7.2 mm to >63.2 mm. Values from the lower bound to 
upper bound interpretation criteria vary by more than a factor of eight, and the COV 
values of these displacement data are high in the range of 40-80%. Obviously, the mean 
displacement of DeBeer is on the conservative side, whereas Chin presents otherwise. The 
mean displacements of Terzaghi and Peck, Davisson, slope tangent, and van der Veen, 
however, are between 19-25 mm. As for L2, 4%B, and Fuller and Hoy, the mean 
displacements are between 34-45 mm. 
 
In the QL1/QL2 evaluation, the mean QL1/QL2 = 0.43 with COV = 0.32. As compared to the 
adjacent load ratios, QL1/QL2 has a lower COV. This can be explained by the fact that both 
QL1 and QL2 are constructed by using the same graphical approach. Furthermore, the 
statistics reveal that the values of COV for the L1 group are much larger than those for the 
L2 group. Consequently, the use of the L2 group is more reliable. 
 
Table 8 lists the comparisons of this study with previous studies (Hirany and Kulhawy 
1988; Cushing and Kulhawy 2001, 2002). It is evident that a more complete and detailed 
interpretation model is established in this study. Based on the available comparison data in 
Table 8, the mean load ratios are generally consistent in current and past research although 
the displacements in ρL1 and ρL2 are somehow different. For ρL1, the difference is relatively 
small. The mean ρL2 in this study is larger than the previous results. This is attributable to 
the larger shaft diameters in this database than the ones previously used. 
 
To prevent undue bias by specific sites brought on by large amounts of load tests, the 
statistical data are taken as an average value per site and are shown in Tables 6 and 7. The 
difference of a full data set and the data averaged per site is very small. Therefore, site bias 
is minimal in these data. 
are likewise shown in Table 8. The load ratios are generally consistent, but the updated 
mean ρL2 (= 30.9 mm) is somehow larger than the previous results. The reason is the same 
as the above analysis of drained condition, reflecting the practical situation of a larger 
shaft diameter. Each site was averaged as well, and the statistics data per site are shown in 
Tables 9 and 10 for load and displacement, respectively. The difference is quite small and 
site bias is minimal in these data. 
 
Comparison of the Drained and Undrained Load Tests 
A comparison of the drained and undrained load tests in Tables 6 through 10 shows some 
interesting points. First, the SD and COV for the undrained tests are generally smaller than 
those for the drained tests. The displacements at ρL1 are likewise quite consistent for both 
drained and undrained analyses; however, all displacements after ρL1 in drained loading 
are more or less larger than those in undrained loading. Furthermore, drained loading 
reveals a smaller QL1/QL2 and a larger QCHIN/QL2. In summary of these results, the trend of 
the initial linear stage is the same, but the load-displacement curve of the drained loading 
demonstrates greater ductility after the initial linear stage. It could likely be that a larger 
displacement is required to mobilize full tip resistance for drained soils. This general type 
of behavior has been previously observed (Reese and O’Neill 1988; Chen and Kulhawy 
1994, 2002; Chen 2006), and these studies demonstrated that the maximum load and full 
tip resistance can be reached at a small displacement for cohesive soils, but a larger 
displacement is needed for cohesionless soils. 
 
In general, the interpreted results for all criteria in the drained and undrained loading 
analyses display the same trend. Of these criteria, the Davisson, slope tangent, and L2 
methods present a smaller COV and more applicable interpretation. Nonetheless, Fuller 
and Hoy exhibits a good interpretation method in undrained loading while failing to 
interpret capacity in many cases for drained loading. The main reason is due to the 
tendency of the undrained load-displacement curve to reach the failure threshold faster, as 
described previously. 
 
The mean load-displacement curves for drained and undrained axial compression loadings 
are given in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. The corresponding ratio of each interpretation 
method to QL2 and its displacement also are shown. On the average, the load at 0.32%B is 
almost equal to L1, while the ratio of L1/L2 is about 0.4-0.5 and the mean Q4%B/QL2 is close 
to 1.0. 
 
Table 11 lists a comparison of regression data for different interpreted results. As 
compared to Tables 6 and 9, it should be noted that a few data points were removed, as 
Axial compression load test data were evaluated for straight-sided drilled shafts in a wide 
variety of soil profiles. The database was wide for shaft geometry, and eight representative 
interpretation criteria were used for evaluation. From these analyses, the following 
consistent results emerged. 
(1) The range of each interpretation method presents the same trend for both drained and 
undrained conditions. DeBeer shows the lowest bound, Chin has the highest bound, 
and Terzaghi and Peck, 4%B, and Fuller and Hoy are close to L2. In addition, the 
DeBeer, Davisson, slope tangent, and van der Veen methods are typically on the L1 
and L2 transition, while Chin always lies above the measured data. 
(2) The statistical data show that the smaller the compression displacement, the higher 
the COV for the interpreted comparisons. The interpretation of the undrained load 
test is less variable than that of the drained test as well. The interpretation methods of 
L1, Davisson, slope tangent, L2, and Fuller and Hoy (for undrained loading) exhibit 
the most reliable results for different displacement stages. 
(3) On the average, QL1 is close to Q0.32%B with a mean displacement of 3-4 mm, while 
QL1 has about 0.4-0.5 QL2. Also, QL2 is close to Q4%B with a mean displacement of 
30-35 mm, and QCHIN is 1.3-1.4 QL2 with a displacement greater than 60 mm. 
(4) The L2, 4%B, and Fuller and Hoy methods are suitable for a general compression 
drilled shaft design with mean displacements between 30-45 mm, while Davisson, 
slope tangent, van der Veen, and Terzaghi and Peck can be applied in a compression 
design in which the displacement is between 15-25 mm. For an extremely restricted 
design displacement (<10 mm), the methods of L1 and DeBeer are proper choices. 
(5) The trend of initial linear stage is the same for both drained and undrained loadings, 
but the load-displacement curve of the drained loading demonstrates greater ductility 
after the initial linear stage. 
(6) It is proper to use the L2 for drilled shaft design. The Q4%B can be employed as a first 
approximation, but only for conventionally constructed drilled shafts. 
(7) The suggested minimum safety factors for more straightforward interpretation 
methods, in decreasing order, are Chin [2.7], 4%B [2.0], Terzaghi and Peck [1.9], 
and Davisson [1.7]. Factored values less than QL1 will also ensure safety factors over 
2. 
(8) When necessary, load of Davisson (or QSTC) can be used to infer QL2 if the load test 
data are insufficient or are terminated prematurely.

大會同時安排 3 位國際知名的專家學者進行 Plenary Speakers，分別為 Cornell 
University 的 Prof. T. D. O’Rourke 講”Geotechnics of Pipeline System Response to 
Earthquake；Virginia Tech 的 Prof. J. K. Michell 講”Recent Developments in Ground 
Improvement for Mitigation of Seismic Risk to Existing Embankment Dams”；及 Tokyo 
Institute of Technology 的 Prof. K. Tokimatsu 講”Geotechnical Problems in the 2007 
Nigata-ken Chuetsu-Oki Earthquake”。他們從地震所引起的大地工程問題談起，先探討
土壤及岩石可能的行為及破壞機制，接著對結構物的影響及可能的破壞模式。針對這些
可能引起的破壞模式，如何用地盤改良工法或加強結構設計的防制及克服提出他們的見
解。最後人類賴以為生的維生管線針對地震及可能產生的液化議題，如何設計及預防等
多是他們演講的重點。這些議題均為相當實際務實的，尤其對於位處地震頻頻區的台灣
而言更顯示重要，值得我們更加以注意，本研討會所安排之專講對於本人的認知有相當
的幫助。 
此次大會所收錄之論文主要為地工地震及土壤動力兩大領域，這些論文可說是包羅
萬象、各俱特色，不僅包含理論發展更重要的亦頗富工程參考價值，從中可認識到世界
各國在大地工程持續發展經營中，於大地及地震工程方面所面臨的難題，以及用以解決
的方式。除此之外大會亦安排與本領域相關的廠商展示他們所開發的最新產品，各參與
技術展示之廠商亦涵蓋美國各知名之顧問公司、著名儀器商、學協會等總計約有 20多
個攤位，包括地震、大地工程、液化及結構等之分析軟體，地震及大地結構相關之量測
儀器及分析系統，各式各樣的大地工程新開發材料與技術，及施工儀器介紹等，可謂包
括各類的先進地工技術，讓我們對於國際間目前於地質、地工及地震的最新應用的新技
術有更進一步之認識。 
本人亦攜回本次研討會之論文集光碟乙份，該光碟將存放於中原大學圖書館，可供
爾後國內有興趣的研究者自由參考。
