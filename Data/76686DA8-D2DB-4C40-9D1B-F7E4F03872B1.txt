Abstract 
The α-β and α-β-γ filters based on the Kalman-like estimation scheme has been recognized as a outstanding 
tool for estimating the position, velocity and acceleration signals of moving objects. Nevertheless, the 
performance of estimation heavily depends on the parameters α, β and γ. In general, the choice of parameters 
is a trade-off optimization problem between the tracking accuracy and noise reduction capability. In order to 
obtain the suitable design of α-β and α-β-γ filters for some specifications, the hybrid Biomimetic algorithm is 
proposed for determining the decisive parameters. In addition, a new integral-type α-β-γ filter is proposed to 
provide the velocity signal based on the measured acceleration signal. The simulation results are employed to 
illustrate that the developed optimal filters are capable of tracking the desired signals accurately, and at the 
same time reducing the noise disturbance remarkably.

1. Introduction 
Motion control is a popular research topic during this notable decade of years. Various feedback control 
schemes have been proposed for linear and nonlinear systems. When practically implementing these control 
schemes, the exact and complete knowledge of system states is necessary. Unfortunately, not all the states can 
be measured due to the restricted sensors or the considerable cost. Therefore, various discrete-time estimation 
schemes have been devised for motion control in practical applications. 
Kalman filter is one of well-known and efficient methods for estimating the states of dynamic system from 
an incomplete and noisy measurement. Because its recursive algorithm, only the one-sample preceding data 
will be sufficient in the calculation. Nevertheless, the computation load is an excessive cost for practical 
implementation. For this reason, some simpler Kalman-like filters, namely α-β filter and α-β-γ filter, are 
usually considered when applied to the Newtonian systems. In literature, Sklansky [1], Benedict [2], Simpson 
[3], Neal [4], Kalata [5], Gray [6], Tenne [7] et al. published some of the earlier work on tracking filters for 
pointing commands in tracking radar.  
Even though there are many discussions about generalized parameters for α-β and α-β-γ filters, most 
developed schemes involve assuming known noise variance to formulate the optimal criteria. Little effort has 
been made about finding the optimal parameters under the condition of unknown noise variance. Therefore, 
the main aim of this study is to search the optimal parameters with the unknown noise variance, and devise a 
tuning strategy for α-β and α-β-γ filters possessing the adaptation capability. On the other hands, an α-β filter 
based integration algorithm is developed for providing velocity-type signals from acceleration-type 
measurements.

with zero mean and variance 2vσ . Once α-β filter is optimally designed to effectively reduce the covariance of 
estimation, which means the effect of the noise on the measurement is made less significant. Several criteria 
have been proposed as performance indices for the design of optimal fixed-gain filters. The most commonly 
used technique is to calculate the Variance Reduction Ratio (VRR). The VRR is defined as the ratio of output 
variance to input variance in steady-state when no input signals are fed into the estimation algorithm

2.2  α-β-γ filters 
Further, the α-β filter algorithm can be extended to a three-dimension estimation scheme which is called 
α-β-γ filter. The estimation processing of α-β-γ filters is related with fixed Kalman gains α, β, and γ. The 
mathematical equations are described as follows

3. hybrid biomimetic algorithm 
In the PSO algorithm, the potential solutions, called particles, fly through the problem space by following 
the current optimum particles.  Each particle keeps track of its coordinates in the problem space which are 
associated with the best solution (fitness) it has achieved so far.  This location is called the pbest.  Another 
"best" value that is tracked by the particle swarm optimizer is the best value obtained so far by any particle in 
the neighbors of the particle.  This location is called the lbest.  When a particle takes all the population as 
its topological neighbors, the lbest is called the gbest. 
At each time step of the PSO algorithm, the velocity and position of each particle are updated toward its 
pbest and lbest locations (local version of PSO).  Each acceleration term is weighted by a random number.  
After finding the two best locations, the particle updates its velocity and position according to (10) and (11):

The mutation property of the genetic algorithm been used in each iteration of particle swarm optimization 
method to generate the new particles.  The new generate particle has the opportunities to avoid local optima 
solution.  The whole procedures of the proposed method are shown as follows: 
Step 1. Initialize particle: each particle presents one of the possible solutions.  The whole population size 
mps ⋅= , where p is the amount of sub-population and m is the particles in each sub-population. 
Step 2. Evolution: evolutes the cost value of each particle. 
Step 3. Arrangement: arrange the particles according to the cost and store in vector E, where

Step 4. Distribution: distribute the arranged particles E into sub-population.

dotted-lines were provided by fuzzy-gain filter. The relating average absolute error (AEE) of estimated signals 
are concluded in Tab. III. We can note that the designed optimal α-β filter by proposed fuzzy gain scheduled 
method demonstrated 36.52% improvement of velocity estimation compared to that using fuzzy-gain filter, in 
addition to the 4.72% improvement of position estimation. As shown in Figs. 16-17, the moving 
root-mean-square error (RMSE) responses with data length 10 are easy to perceive the contrast between the 
proposed method and fuzzy-gain filter. In order to verify the proposed optimal α-β filter is also superior in the 
simulation of low SNR, we do the compared examples with SNR = 15 and SNR =5. The comparison results 
are concluded in Tab. IV and Tab. V. Compared with the fuzzy-gain filter, the developed optimal α-β filter 
demonstrated 67.88% and 81.83% improvements of velocity estimation within SNR = 15 and SNR = 5, 
respectively, in addition to the 19.35% and 29.99% improvements of position estimation. With the statistics as 
illustrated in Fig. 18, we can notice that the estimation performance of proposed fuzz gain scheduled α-β filter 
has an obviously improvement as compared with the fuzzy-gain filter, especially in velocity signal. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this study, we have successfully designed optimal α-β and α-β-γ filters for the motion control. The 
designed filters based on the proposed fuzzy gain scheduled optimization method could be utilized to provide 
the unmeasured kinematic states which are necessary in the implementation of state feedback controllers. 
Unlike the derivative-based optimization methods, the proposed optimization algorithm is performed without 
a smooth objective function which is advantageous in the hardware realization. From the simulation results, 
we can find that the estimated signals are indeed smooth and available for the practical applications. By 
compare with fuzzy-gain filter proposed by Chan, the presented method provides the high improvement.
