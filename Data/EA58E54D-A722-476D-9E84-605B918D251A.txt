Abstract 
Technically a precision engineering surface can 
be generated by grinding.  Grinding is an 
abrasive machining process full of uncertainty.  
Ground surface quality is usually unstable and 
will be deteriorated as the process proceeds.  If 
the variation of grinding can be forecast to alarm 
before the occurrence of unsatisfactory, the 
process can be well controlled for production.  
The purpose of this paper is to construct a grey 
model to predict CBN grinding based upon the 
input from grinding AE (acoustic emission) 
energy. The grinding AE energy extracted from 
the AE signal acquired during grinding can 
effectively reveal the roughness variation of the 
ground surface.  A grey model was constructed 
based on the data collected from a grinding 
experiment, and found to be well correlated with 
the trend of the data.  The prediction accuracy 
of the model, no matter in-sample or 
out-of-sample, is better than 90%.  It is thus 
believed that grey prediction is suited for a 
prognostic monitoring of CBN grinding.

Grey Prediction. 
 
1. Introduction 
As the global market becomes highly 
competitive, the precision industry tends to 
pursuit cost reduction, efficiency improvement, 
and quality maintenance, which may be 
achieved with the aid of process automation.  
Grinding is one of the major machining 
processes to generate engineering surface with 
required precision and quality.  Especially, 
grinding with CBN (cubic boron nitride) 
abrasive is important due to its excellent wear 
resistant and consistent quality. Usually grinding 
is operated by skilled operator to ensure the 
result due to the unstable characteristics of the 
process such that autonomous grinding may not 
be easily achieved.  However, if the process is 
operated under monitoring to ensure its quality, 
the required manpower can be reduced, and

2. Methodology and Monitoring System 
The purpose of this paper is to develop a 
predictive model for the monitoring of CBN 
grinding.  Process monitoring usually identifies 
the tool state with a pre-built algorithm, which is 
developed utilizing production logics based on a 
predictive model with input data acquired from 
the process.  This paper is to construct the 
model with grey GM(1,1) model based on the 
acquired AE data which is analyzed by wavelet 
transform to extract signal characteristics (AE 
energy).  Experiment of different grinding 
conditions was performed for data collection, 
and to confirm the correlation between AE 
energy and ground roughness.  A grey GM(1,1) 
model was then constructed from the collected 
data.  The model was also validated from 
in-sample and out-of-sample. 
 
3. Lifting Wavelet and Signal Characteristic 
When grinding is monitored, vast amount of 
data is continuously acquired by the sensor 
which can not be effectively correlated with the 
process.  Data extraction is necessary.  
Wavelet transform was then used in this study.  
Wavelet transform can analyze data within time 
and frequency domains simultaneously [15].  
Lifting Wavelet [15,16] is similar to discrete 
wavelet transform except that the number of 
samples at each stage is the same as the initial 
set of the samples. The input samples can be 
split into odd and even sets of sample and 
passed through the filters (lifting steps) to give 
rise to approximation (A) and details (D), as is 
shown in Fig. 1. 
 
Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of lifting wavelet 
transform [16] 
This analysis can be performed for many 
layers of filtering from the sampled data without 
losing accuracy.  The decomposed data can 
also be recombined back to its original signal, as 
in Fig. 2.  Lifting wavelet can filter signal to 
the designated frequency domain and still 
maintain the original characteristic.  When 
local signal characteristic is obtained, the 
amount of data is still too large to handle 
effectively and further computation is required.  
After multi-layer analysis of the signal, wavelet 
coefficient for each layer can be treated as a 
coefficient vector dj(k), j = 1,2,…, m, where j is 
the corresponding layer number, and k the scale.  
The energy of the coefficient vector can be 
expressed as an average energy [17],

where Tj is the total scale for each layer.  
Different layer may have different Tj, due to 
different resolution of each layer.

4. Grey Prediction Model 
Grey theory proposed by Deng in 1982 [18] is 
especially designed for the system of uncertain 
with information incomplete to be correlated 
with the system model.  A system is known as 
grey if its information is partly known and partly 
unknown.  Model constructed with internal 
limited information is known as grey modeling.  
Grey prediction is the analysis utilizing GM(1,1) 
as the model base to predict future event using 
the current available data.  The basic theory 
can be described by the following: 
For a given input data sequence, x(0)＝(x(0)(1), 
x(0)(2), …, x(0)(n)), an accumulated operation is 
taken on x(0) to become:

specimen.  The data was collected at 900 kHz 
of the sampling frequency via a data acquisition 
system (A/D card model, NI-PCI 6110).  Right 
after data collection, the specimen was unloaded 
to measure the ground surface roughness.  The 
procedure repeated until total material removal 
of 50000 mm3 has reached. 
Table 1 Conditions for the preliminary test 
Set vs (m/s) vw (m/min) ae (μm)
A 35 8 20
B 30 5 20
 
The test was run and data collected.  The 
recorded ground roughness was plotted against 
the accumulated material removal, as in Fig. 3.  
It can be seen that the ground roughness tends to 
increase to a high value at around 10000 mm3 of 
removal volume and starts to scatter afterward. 
The roughness was not further increased 
prominently, which suggests the variability of 
the grain sharpness during grinding has reached 
a near stable condition such that the ground 
roughness only shows a scattered situation along 
the process. 
 
 
Fig. 3 Ground roughness variation along 
grinding for set A and B 
As for the recorded AE signal, a wavelet 
transform analysis was performed. The signal 
data was decomposed into 6 frequency bands 
(cD1~cD6) to calculate average energy for each 
band.  It was found that cD1 energy contains 
most of the signal energy among these bands 
and was thus taken as the signal characteristics 
(AE energy).  The AE energy for the test was 
then plotted against the accumulated removal in 
Fig. 4.  In the figure, the AE energy was 
initially high and soon experienced a quick 
drops until removal volume reached 10000 mm3 
and then mildly scattered.  This is because the 
initially dulled CBN grain was undergone a 
vigorous micro-fracture during grinding.  As 
the process became stable and the grain sharper, 
grain fracture activity turned into moderate such 
that grinding AE energy becomes lower. 
As comparing the curves in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, 
it was found that the ground roughness becomes 
deteriorated as the AE energy soon decreases to 
the lower level, which indicates an 
over-sharpened of the wheel grain.  The AE 
energy shows an inverse trend as the ground 
roughness variation, which suggests that this 
energy can be used to describe grinding 
variation.  It was then decided that the grinding 
AE energy be used as the input to construct the 
grey model.  The AE energy was initially in 
high level, which indicates dulled wheel grain 
and thereby more grinding energy was 
consumed.  The curve then decreases down to 
the lower level, thus a state of wheel 
over-sharpened.  It is thereby a suggested 
timing for a wheel redressing.

prediction is said to be the model capability for 
prediction since larger forward prediction step 
would lead to a less accuracy system. 
 
7. Experimental Result and Discussion 
As the experiment was finished, the extracted 
AE energy from grinding signal and the 
measured ground roughness were recorded and 
plotted against the accumulated removal, as in 
Fig 5. The figure shows quite consistently that 
the AE energy decreases with the increase of the 
ground roughness for all the tests.  The trend of 
these curves is similar to what was found in the 
preliminary test.  
The recorded AE data was then fed into the 
grey model GM(1,1) to predict AE energy.  A 
total data fitness test for the prediction was 
thereby performed. The prediction error (MAE 
and MAPE) was calculated, as is shown in Table 
3. The MAE for all the test is around 0.002282~ 
0.004369, and the MAPE is less then 6%.  This 
result indicates that the grey prediction of 
grinding AE energy is in excellent level.

Average 0.000695 0.043946
 
Out-of-sample prediction was also performed 
for 3 different steps of forward prediction (SFP).  
Table 4 shows the prediction error for 1-SFP, 
4-SFP, and 8-SFP.  It is seen from the table that 
the MAE lies between 0.00356~0.00959 and 
MAPE between 0.0365~0.0467 for all the 
conditions.  It suggests a highly accurate 
prediction. The predicted results of 8-SFP for all 
the tests are plotted vs. the accumulated 
volumetric removal in Fig 6.  From the figure, 
it can be seen that the predicted data lies very 
close to the sampled measurement and is within 
90% confidence interval for most of the cases.  
Based on the prediction, the model can 
accurately predict data up to 8 future events.  It 
makes the grey predictor of great usefulness for 
a prognostic monitoring system to capture 
possible occurrence 8 events earlier such that 
preventive action may be taken accordingly.  It 
is therefore verified that grey prediction is in 
good correlation with the variation of CBN 
grinding AE energy and is suited for the 
modeling of a prognostic monitoring for CBN 
grinding. 
 
8. Conclusion 
This study utilized grinding AE energy as the 
model input to construct a grey prediction model 
for CBN grinding process.  The AE energy was 
extracted with wavelet transform from the 
recorded AE grinding signal.  This model is 
capable of predicting the trend of AE energy 
variation, and thus the corresponding ground 
roughness.  The following conclusion can be 
drawn for this study: 
(1).The developed grey model of CBN grinding 
is capable of predicting the trend of the 
process.  The prediction accuracy of the 
model within sample is better than 90% and 
is also around 90 % out of sample.  Overall 
speaking the prediction error is acceptable to 
provide good prediction. 
(2).The grey model can accurately predict up to 
8 future events based on the acquired 
samples for CBN grinding AE energy.  
Based on the prediction, a monitoring system 
may suggest preventive action early before 
the occurrence of unwanted event. 
(3).Grinding data extracted from AE signal, the 
energy of cD1 frequency band, is found to be 
inversely related to the ground roughness 
variation.  This quantity was the input to 
the grey model for CBN grinding.

Abstract:  
Surface grinding is a machining process with unstable quality which is usually deteriorated as the process 
proceeds.  If grinding can be forecast to alarm before unsatisfactory, the process can be well controlled.  
The purpose of this paper is to construct a grey model for CBN grinding based upon AE (acoustic emission) 
energy extracted from AE signal of grinding to reflect ground roughness variation.  A grey model for the 
conducted experiment was found to be well correlated with the grinding trend.  The prediction accuracy, 
in-sample or out-of-sample, is better than 90%, which makes grey prediction suitable for prognostic 
monitoring of grinding.

1. Introduction 
As the global market becomes highly competitive, the 
precision industry tends to pursuit cost reduction, 
efficiency improvement, and quality maintenance, which 
may be achieved with the aid of process automation.  
Grinding is one of the major machining processes to 
generate engineering surface with required precision and 
quality.  Especially, grinding with CBN (cubic boron 
nitride) abrasive is important due to its excellent wear 
resistant and consistent quality.  Usually grinding is 
operated by skilled operator to ensure the result due to the 
unstable characteristics of the process such that 
autonomous grinding may not be easily achieved.  
However, if the process is operated under monitoring to 
ensure its quality, the required manpower can be reduced, 
and autonomous grinding could therefore be possible. 
Grinding process utilizes abrasive grains of a rotational 
wheel to minutely remove work material with tight 
tolerance.  As the process proceeds, the grain wears and 
to some extent the wheel would act improperly to generate 
unacceptable surface.  The wheel then requires a 
reconditioning operation (dressing) to restore its function.  
In between dressing, proper grinding behavior is expected. 
If the state of wheel surface (sharp or dull) may be 
recognized instantaneously for any possible defect with a 
condition-based monitoring system, grinding could then 
be operated properly with less human attention. Typically, 
a process monitoring, including diagnostic and prognostic 
systems [1], needs to acquire data from the process with 
sensor, from which the characteristic value capable of 
describing the state of the process is extracted.  Based on 
the data, the system is able to predict the process with a 
pre-built model. 
As mentioned, the state of the process could be 
described by the data acquired via sensor.  Kwak [2] 
studied the correlation between grinding power and 
ground roughness with a power transducer.  Chen [3] 
also used a power transducer to record grinding resistant 
to material removal.  He concluded his study with a 
relation between grinding energy and ground surface.  
Couey [4] monitored grinding force to predict the timing 
for unsatisfied ground surface.  Tönshoff [5] used an AE 
sensor to monitor grinding and he found that the signal 
was related to the ground surface.  Dornfield [6] 
analyzed AE signal of surface grinding and found that AE 
energy is in logarithm relation to grinding depth. 
Usually the amount of data acquired by sensor is too 
large to be effectively correlated with the process and 
requires an extraction for signal characteristic.  Xiaoli et 
al [7] utilized wavelet transform to process AE signal into 
several frequency bands for abnormal situation in the 
worn tool.  Lundholm [8] predicted tool damage from 
cutting force with wavelet transform of the signal.  Gu 
[9] monitored the tool state with a non-stationary 
technique to separate signal into time and frequency 
domains as an index for monitoring. 
The purpose of a process model is to predict potential 
trend of the process from input data. Proper selection of 
the modeling tool could be crucial for the performance of 
monitoring.  Sun et al [10] used supportive vector 
machine to evaluate the state of tool condition for process 
monitoring with considering the process loss due to the 
tool state.  Hwang [11] utilized back propagation neural 
net work, together with Taguchi method to precisely 
predict tool wear and machined surface roughness, with 
average error less than 4.72% and 3.92% respectively.  
Shih [12] constructed a time series model to predict CBN 
grinding with a 90% accuracy of prediction.  In his 
studies, AE energy is the model input, which is extracted 
from grinding AE signal with wavelet transform.  Tie 
[13] predicted the timing for the drilling stem failure using 
theory from grey prediction, and was found to be very 
close to the actual occurrence.  In Chen’s study [14], he 
compared the grey GM(1,1) model and time series model

5. Preliminary Test 
As mentioned, the aim of this paper is to construct a 
prognostic model for CBN surface grinding process using 
signal characteristics extracted from the acquired AE data.  
It is then necessary before model construction to realize 
the potential relationship between the signal key data and 
CBN grinding with a preliminary test.  The test was to 
explore the extraction procedure for the signal and 
observe the potential relationship between key data and 
ground surface.  The condition for the test is in Table 1.  
The grinding wheel used in the test was 300N100BW3X 
(200×10×50 mm ).  The specimen was a typical mold 
material (SKD11) with hardness HRc 60.  Before every 
test, the grinding wheel was dressed with the same 
parameter such that every test run was done under the 
same wheel condition. 
During the test, AE data was acquired for one grinding 
pass at every 2500 mm3 of accumulated material removal 
by an AE sensor (Kistler 8152B211) located in the side 
wall of the specimen.  The data was collected at 900 kHz 
of the sampling frequency via a data acquisition system 
(A/D card model, NI-PCI 6110).  Right after data 
collection, the specimen was unloaded to measure the 
ground surface roughness.  The procedure repeated until 
total material removal of 50000 mm3 has reached.

The test was run and data collected.  The recorded 
ground roughness was plotted against the accumulated 
material removal, as in Fig. 3.  It can be seen that the 
ground roughness tends to increase to a high value at 
around 10000 mm3 of removal volume and starts to scatter 
afterward. The roughness was not further increased 
prominently, which suggests the variability of the grain 
sharpness during grinding has reached a near stable 
condition such that the ground roughness only shows a 
scattered situation along the process.

for set A and B 
As for the recorded AE signal, a wavelet transform 
analysis was performed. The signal data was decomposed 
into 6 frequency bands (cD1~cD6) to calculate average 
energy for each band.  It was found that cD1 energy 
contains most of the signal energy among these bands and 
was thus taken as the signal characteristics (AE energy).  
The AE energy for the test was then plotted against the 
accumulated removal in Fig. 4.  In the figure, the AE 
energy was initially high and soon experienced a quick 
drops until removal volume reached 10000 mm3 and then 
mildly scattered.  This is because the initially dulled 
CBN grain was undergone a vigorous micro-fracture

increase of the ground roughness for all the tests.  The 
trend of these curves is similar to what was found in the 
preliminary test.  
The recorded AE data was then fed into the grey model 
GM(1,1) to predict AE energy.  A total data fitness test 
for the prediction was thereby performed. The prediction 
error (MAE and MAPE) was calculated, as is shown in 
Table 3. The MAE for all the test is around 0.002282~ 
0.004369, and the MAPE is less then 6%.  This result 
indicates that the grey prediction of grinding AE energy is 
in excellent level.

Out-of-sample prediction was also performed for 3 
different steps of forward prediction (SFP).  Table 4 
shows the prediction error for 1-SFP, 4-SFP, and 8-SFP.  
It is seen from the table that the MAE lies between 
0.00356~0.00959 and MAPE between 0.0365~0.0467 for 
all the conditions.  It suggests a highly accurate 
prediction. The predicted results of 8-SFP for all the tests 
are plotted vs. the accumulated volumetric removal in Fig 
6.  From the figure, it can be seen that the predicted data 
lies very close to the sampled measurement and is within 
90% confidence interval for most of the cases.  Based on 
the prediction, the model can accurately predict data up to 
8 future events.  It makes the grey predictor of great 
usefulness for a prognostic monitoring system to capture 
possible occurrence 8 events earlier such that preventive 
action may be taken accordingly.  It is therefore verified 
that grey prediction is in good correlation with the 
variation of CBN grinding AE energy and is suited for the 
modeling of a prognostic monitoring for CBN grinding. 
 
8. Conclusion 
This study utilized grinding AE energy as the model 
input to construct a grey prediction model for CBN 
grinding process.  The AE energy was extracted with 
wavelet transform from the recorded AE grinding signal.  
This model is capable of predicting the trend of AE 
energy variation, and thus the corresponding ground 
roughness.  The following conclusion can be drawn for 
this study: 
(1). The developed grey model of CBN grinding is 
capable of predicting the trend of the process.  The 
prediction accuracy of the model within sample is 
better than 90% and is also around 90 % out of 
sample.  Overall speaking the prediction error is 
acceptable to provide good prediction. 
(2). The grey model can accurately predict up to 8 future 
events based on the acquired samples for CBN 
grinding AE energy.  Based on the prediction, a 
monitoring system may suggest preventive action 
early before the occurrence of unwanted event. 
(3). Grinding data extracted from AE signal, the energy 
of cD1 frequency band, is found to be inversely 
related to the ground roughness variation.  This 
quantity was the input to the grey model for CBN 
grinding.
