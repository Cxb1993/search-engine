摘要 
製程人員向來是持續地改善製程，而改善製程的必要步驟之ㄧ，即是有效地辨識出製
程產生干擾時的改變點或啟始點。統計製程管制(Statistical Process Control, SPC)是利用製程
操作變數對生產變數或產品的品質變數進行監控，當製程開始發生失控時，到利用 SPC 監
控製程得到失控的啟始點，有一定的時間落後存在，因此如何能在品質出現變異後，以最
短的時間找出製程出現失控的啟始點，是工業界研究的重要主題之ㄧ。以往傳統的製程大
都假設服從常態，而本研究探討在製程服從 Uniform 分配時，如何使用 SPC 管制圖結合最
大概似估計(Maximum Likelihood Estimation，簡稱 MLE)法，以估計 Uniform 製程出錯的啟
始點。同時由於應用傳統 SPC 下常態之 σμ 3± 之管制界限，很慢偵測到出錯點，因此本文
應用蒙地卡羅技術決定 X 管制圖之管制界限監控 Uniform 製程時之真實管制界限。

Abstract 
 When the process personnel can not find or fix the process immediately, it will cause the 
shatters of the product. Therefore, if we can find the change point of a process as soon as 
possible, we can decrease the waste of the cost. Thus, how to effectively estimate the change 
point of process becomes a very important research issue. Different from the traditional 
normality distributed assumption for a process, this study considers a process which follows a 
uniform distribution. This research uses SPC charts to combine maximum likelihood technique 
to estimate the change point of a process. When we apply the typical 3μ σ±  to monitor the 
uniform process, it is too slow to detect the change point. Consequently, this research employs 
the Monte Carlo technique to determine the control limits for SPC charts. 
 
Keywords: Uniform process, change point, maximum likelihood estimation, Monte Carlo 
 
1. 緒論 
監控製程是達成產品高品質的首要基石，但往往因為使用不適當的原料、不當的操作、
機器老舊或人為疏失等可歸屬原因導致製程發生變異。統計製程管制（statistical process 
control,簡稱 SPC）是監控品質的主要技術之ㄧ。 
SPC 管制圖是由 Shewhart 博士在 1931 年開始發展，SPC 管制圖主要的概念是收集製
程的品質特性之樣本資料，並且依統計檢定理論繪製出管制圖的上下限，當樣本點超出管
制上下限時，表示製程極有可能產生變異；而針對此失控樣本點，製程人員應找出導致製
程失控的可歸屬原因，並且及時修正，進而加以改善製程，以使產品維持在高品質狀態。
製程人員若能儘早找出製程失控的根本原因（root causes），對此原因及時加以修正，就能
節省因為延誤發現失控點所造成的成本與人力的浪費。通常，當製程發生干擾時，製程則
處於失控狀態，而此干擾開始產生失控的時間，稱之為製程失控的啟始點。 
 當製程發生干擾時，操作人員若不能及時發現錯誤，將會導致產品品質受損。而操作
人員如果能及時發現製程發生干擾，並且立即修正製程，則可以避免浪費不必要的時間與
成本，更能維持並提升產品的品質。在傳統上，SPC管制圖的方法，一般均假設觀測値之
間互相獨立，且具有相同分配，而相同分配通常都假設為常態分配。但是在實務上，觀測
値不一定都是常態分配，由於Uniform 製程普遍存在業界。因此，本文將以Uniform分配來
進行研究。但是在假設製程服從Uniform分配之下，以傳統的SPC管制圖對Uniform分配的

（一）問題ㄧ：如何決定Uniform製程之管制上下限？ 
（二）問題二：若製程服從Uniform分配，如何找出製程失控的啟始時間？ 
    根據問題ㄧ的闡述，我們需以正確的管制界限監控出Uniform製程產生干擾訊號之時
間，再結合MLE法往前推估製程干擾之啟始時間。如同問題ㄧ所闡述，SPC管制圖之平均
值 σ3± 管制界限，並不適用於監控Uniform製程之干擾訊號時間。因此針對此問題，我們對
Uniform製程之管制界限作進一步的推導，以找出最適用的管制界限。X 管制圖的管制界限
推導如下：

此二值分別為 X 管制圖管制上限與管制下限之估計值。 
    根據問題二的闡述，本文提出製程服從 Uniform 分配假設下，以 SPC 管制圖結合 MLE
法找出製程失控的啟始點。其推導過程如下：

Abstract: Statistical process control (SPC) charts are proven to be effective to monitor industrial 
processes.  However, the typical Shewhart control charts are insensitive in detecting small 
process shifts.  This results in large values of average run length (ARL); that is, more samples 
are required to detect the process shifts.  As a consequence, the search for the root causes may 
need more time and the process improvement may take longer. One possible solution for 
shortening the search time of the root causes is to identify the starting time of the root causes of 
the disturbances.  Once this identification is quickly and accurately made, the root causes of the 
disturbances would be easily determined.  Since neural networks (NN) are reported to be quite 
useful in classification, this study is motivated to integrate SPC charts and NN to identify the 
starting time of a disturbance.  This study employs the concept of binomial experimentation to 
integrate SPC and NN.  The benefits of using the integration mechanism and the fruitful results 
are demonstrated. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The primary function of SPC charts is that an out-of-control signal will be triggered when the 
assignable causes (i.e., the process disturbances) arise in the process.  When a signal is 
generated, a search for the root causes of the process disturbances is started.  Once the root 
causes have been determined and eliminated, the corrective actions would bring the 
out-of-control process back into an in-control state.  In practice, the root cause determination 
process is not straightforward.  Typically, techniques such as fishbone diagrams are used to 
search for the root causes of a process disturbance, and the effectiveness of these techniques is 
heavily dependant on the “starting time” of a process disturbance.  The “starting time” would 
contain the most accurate and useful evidence that enables the easy and correct determination of 
the root causes of a process disturbance.  However, the question is “when is the starting time of 
a process disturbance?”  Although SPC charts have been widely used in industry for decades, 
there are still deficiencies.  With the use of SPC charts alone, it is still not possible to identify 
the starting time of a process disturbance.  Even when the signal is generated, the only certainty 
is that something went wrong, the exact starting time of the disturbances is still unknown. 
Because of the ability of classification, neural networks (NN) are widely used in industry.

follows. 
(1) Input layer: the input variables of the NN. 
(2) Hidden layer: the operands between the input layer and the output layer. 
(3) Output layer: the output variables of the NN.  
In this study, the input and output variables of BPN models for two SPC control charts are 
showed in Table 1.  This study uses “0” to represent the in control state and “1” for the 
out-of-control state.  The classification of the observed value is the goal value, the output of the 
BPN model. 
                                             
                                             
3. EXAMPLES 
 
This study considers a certain process in which the first 100 sample observations of the process 
come from an in control state, and a process disturbance is generated starting the time period of 
101.  The first 100 observations are assumed to be N(0,1), the normally distributed with mean 
of 0 and the variance of 1.  After time 101, the process is assumed to have the following mean 
shifts:
xkσμμ += 01 , Where the 0μ  is the in control process mean, (i.e, this study consider 
0μ =0,) 1μ  is the out-of-control process  mean, and k is a mean shift quantity (typically, k is 
setup as k=0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3, respectively)

.Taking Table 2 for example, sample No.160 point is signaled by the SPC chart.  The 
purpose of this study is to identify the starting time of a disturbance.  Therefore, we would 
neglect the observed values after point No.160.  In Table 2, the column“Retro-samples＂are 
the samples of the observed value cumulating to point No.160.  In the column “NN 
out-of-control signal”, 1 represents the observed value is the out-of-control point and 0 
represents the observed value is in control and isn’t the out-of-control point.  The column “NN 
out-of-control signal cumulation” represents the sum of the NN out-of-control signals in the 
retro-samples of the observed value.  In the study, we use the retro-sample as the experiment 
times, the NN out-of-control signals cumulation as the success times, and the success probability 
as the correct estimation probability of the neural network model.  In this way, the binomial 
distribution cumulative probability could be figured out. 
In Table 2, it was understood that the NN out-of-control signals from sample No.156 to 
 16

Abstract 
 
Statistical process control (SPC) charts are useful in monitoring a process.  However, the typical 
Shewhart control charts are insensitive in detecting small process shifts.  This would require more 
samples to detect the process disturbances.  Consequently, the search for the root causes of the 
disturbances may need more time, and the process improvement may take longer. One useful solution 
for this difficulty is to identify the change point of the process in real time. Once this identification is 
correctly made, the root causes of the disturbances would be easily determined.  This study is 
motivated to integrate SPC charts and neural networks to quickly identify the change point of the 
process. The concept of the integration mechanism is discussed, and the fruitful results are also 
demonstrated. 
 
1. Introduction 
The major function of SPC charts is that an out-of-control signal would be generated when the 
assignable causes (i.e., the process disturbances) arise in the process.  When a signal is generated, a 
search for the root causes of the process disturbances is started.  Once the root causes have been 
determined and eliminated, the corrective actions would bring the out-of-control process back into an 
in-control state.  In practice, the root cause determination process is not straightforward.  Typically, 
techniques such as fishbone diagrams are used to search for the root causes of a process disturbance, 
and the effectiveness of these techniques is heavily dependant on the “starting time” of a process 
disturbance.  The “starting time” would contain the most accurate and useful evidence that enables 
the easy and correct determination of the root causes of a process disturbance.  However, the 
question is “when is the starting time of a process disturbance?”  Although SPC charts have been 
widely used in industry for decades, there are still deficiencies.  With the use of SPC charts alone, it 
is still not possible to identify the starting time of a process disturbance.  Even when the signal is 
generated, the only certainty is that something went wrong, the exact starting time of the disturbances 
is still unknown. 
Because of the ability of classification, neural networks (NN) are widely used in industry.  The 
purpose of this study is to integrate SPC charts and NN to identify the starting time of a disturbance. 
This study uses the X control chart to demonstrate the fruitful results of the proposed approaches. In 
this study binomial experimentation is applied to the neural network model, and the cumulative 
probability of the binominal distribution is used to help determine the starting time of a process 
disturbance. 
 22 
 
out-of-control signals cumulation (success times) is 5, and the binomial distribution cumulative 
probability is 1.  Thus, the fact that the process is out of control at sample No.156, and the process 
error starting time should be point No.156 instead of point No.160 as estimated by the SPC chart, 
could be confirmed.  When the process is interfered with by un-attributable factors or mistakes of 
the neural network model, leading to discontinuous out-of control signal 1, the binomial distribution 
cumulative probability value would be reduced.  From the Table 1, it was found that the binomial 
distribution cumulative probability is 0.96 at sample No.147 and it’s still in our acceptable range.  In 
the following sections the results of the proposed approach and the traditional SPC charts alone are 
discussed. 
When the sample size equals one, An X control chart is usually used to monitor the process.  
From Table 2, it can be found that the average starting time is 246.76, approximately 247 when using 
X control charts at 0.5 shift quantity.  After NN integration, the average starting time is 244.62, 
approximately 245 on accumulative probability 1.  It can be 2 points ahead.  The average starting 
time is 135.35, approximately 136 on accumulative probability 0.99.  It can be 9 points ahead to find 
the process is out of control.  And the average starting time is 197.8, approximately 198 on 
accumulative probability 0.9.  It is the best result to 47 points ahead.  The average starting time is 
167.16, approximately 168 in using X control chart at 1 shift quantity.  And the results of all the 
accumulative probabilities are the same. 
In medium process shift, the average starting time is approximately 119 at 1.5 shift quantity. From 
Table 2, it is known that when the accumulative probability is set lower, the starting time can be 
found the earlier.  And the average starting time is approximately 107 at 2 shift quantity.  The 
results in all accumulative probability are similar and the average starting times are approximately 
105.  It ahead 2 points to find the process is out of control.  In conclusion, the result of NN 
integration produces more sensitivity than only using X control charts in small and medium process 
shifts.  The process starting time can be found earlier and the standard deviation is smaller. 
 Because X control charts can be used effectively with large process shifts, the difference of using 
X control chart and NN integration isn’t obvious. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, how to quickly identify the starting time of a disturbance in the cases of process mean 
shifts has been discussed.  The X control chart have been combined with NN, and the binomial 
distribution theory has been utilized to propose our identification procedures.  Effective process 
monitoring techniques have been constructed on strong theoretical bases.  The poor capabilities of 
the SPC charts (which are unable to estimate the starting time of a disturbance in real time) have been 
improved.  The following key research findings are addressed. 
In summary, through NN integration with SPC charts we could absolutely improve the weakness 
of traditional SPC charts.  Although the result of this study showed that NN could improve the 
weakness of SPC charts, the correct estimation probability of the constructed NN model in the study 
still has large room for improvement.  If the correct estimation probability of the model could be 
raised and the false estimation probability of the model reduced, then the process starting time of the 
disturbance could be found out in advance.  Responsibly, the result of this study could be perfected.
