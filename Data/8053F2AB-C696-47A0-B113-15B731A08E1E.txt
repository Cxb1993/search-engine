中文摘要: 
無線寬頻網路例如 WiMAX （Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access）
與 LTE（Long-Term Evolution）等都具有頻寬大與距離長的覆蓋能力，對於影音串流服
務（例如 IPTV、VoD、MoD、P2P 等等）提供了一個較佳的傳輸環境，然而在無線寬頻網
路產生壅塞或可用頻寬突然改變時，即時影音串流（Real-time Video Streaming）的封
包仍然有可能會被丟棄，如此會造成影片播放不順暢與畫面模糊不清現象，如畫面停格
或馬賽克畫面。近幾年由於 SVC （Scalable Video Coding）影音壓縮技術的出現，使
得在無線網路上傳輸即時影音串流有了一個較佳的方式，尤其當無線網路發生壅塞或可
用頻寬突然改變時透過 SVC layers 的合併（Merging）與分流（Splitting），使用者可
觀看到比傳統影音壓縮方式更佳的畫面。在本計畫中，為了更有效率使用下世代無線寬
頻網路，我們將充分利用 SVC 多層級（Multi-layer）與可調整的特性，在 SVC Server
與 Client 之間設計一個 SVC 影音串流閘道器（SVC Streaming Gateway 或 SSG），SSG 可
以根據 Client 端目前的可用頻寬（Available Bandwidth）來進行 SVC Streams 的合併
與分流，其主要目的是要動態增減所傳送的 SVC Layers 數目，以有效降低無線寬頻網路
的不必要頻寬浪費。本計畫共分為三階段，在第一階段，我們首先將針對具有相同連線
要求的影音串流，利用 SVC 多層級的特性，在 SSG 上進行 Stream Splitting 與 Merging 
的演算法設計，以達到有效節省 WiMAX 的頻寬。我們在此計畫的第二階段，我們將利用
模擬器 NS-2 進行 SSG 與 Stream Splitting/Merging 的網路模擬，並且使用模擬後的數
據進一步修改第一階段中所提出的相關演算法。我們在此計畫的第三階段，將在 Linux
平台上實作此一 SSG 與相關的演算法，主要功能包括切割 SVC-NAL 的模組、可用頻寬
(Available Bandwidth)測量的模組、Merging/Splitting 的模組。最後我們將經由中山
大學建置的 WiMAX 網路，利用實測數據來驗證我們所提出的 SSG 可以有效的疏解無線網
路上的多媒體資料流量，以提供不同品質等級的影音串流服務。

英文摘要: 
 
The emerging next-generation wireless broadband networks, such as WiMAX 
(Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) and LTE (Long-Term Evolution), can 
provide better transmission quality for the services of video streaming (e.g., IPTV, VoD, MoD, 
P2P, etc.) due to their wide bandwidth and long-distance coverage. However, video packets 
may still be dropped when the available bandwidth is unexpectedly changed or when the 
network becomes congested. The large loss of video packets could make the video pictures 
become blurred, unsmooth, mosaic or even completely frozen. In recent years, the appearance 
of SVC (Scalable Video Coding) compression techniques has created a better way to transmit 
real-time video streams over wireless networks. In this project, to utilize the wireless 
bandwidth more efficiently, we adequately employ the SVC scalability of multi-layers in the 
design of a SVC Streaming Gateway (SSG). By adaptively merging and splitting SVC streams 
in the SSG, video quality can be improved when the wireless network becomes congested. 
Thus, the main purpose of this project is to dynamically increase or decrease SVC layers of a 
video stream to adapt to network changes so that unnecessary bandwidth wastage in wireless 
broadband networks can be effectively reduced. This project is divided into three stages. In the 
first stage, our goal aims at designing stream splitting and merging algorithms by fully 
utilizing SVC multi-layers characteristics to effectively save the wireless bandwidth. In the 
在 Server 與 Client 中間建置具有合併與分流功能的 SVC Streaming Gateway（SSG），
當 SVC Streams 從 Server 傳下來時，SSG 會依據目前 Client 端回報的頻寬狀態，合併與分
流所有經過它的 SVC Streams，如此可大大節省 Server 與 SSG 之間的頻寬，並且解決了圖 2-1
中不同 Layers 以不同 Session 傳送所產生的不同步問題。  
三、 文獻探討 
在本節我們針對SVC影音串流的相關研究分為三部份，第一部份是利用優先權來調整
Stream Bit Rate（SBR）。第二部份是利用中間節點來調整SBR。第三部份為其它SVC影音串流
的相關研究。 
利用優先權調整SBR: 針對高封包遺失率以及低頻寬的GPRS/EDGE網路環境和低計算能力的掌
上型裝置，C. Yuan等學者[1]提出Priority-based Layer Switching（PLS），PLS Scheme是
根據RTCP的Receiver Report回報瞬間的網路頻寬，來丟掉部分Enhancement layers的封包以
改善影音品質。Li-Na Zhang等人[2]提出在GPRS/EDGE網路環境中傳輸SVC Video，並利用SVC
分層的結構與不同的錯誤保護機制，達到提高影片的PSNR，並針對SVC不同的Layer提供不同
的FEC（Forward Error Correction）保護方法。Jen-Chun Chiang等人[3]提出當WiMAX頻寬
使用量超過設定門檻時，則在BS丟棄低優先權User的Enhancement Layer封包來達到減輕網路
負擔。Ingo Kofler等人[4]提出將Priority分為Video與Best Effort兩種，並在Proxy上透過
借用Best Effort的頻寬使SVC Video Streaming可享有夠好的品質。Giuseppe Bianchi等人
[5]在WLAN Access Point前設置Virtual BottleNeck（VBN），並將其出口頻寬調成比實際網
路可承載的頻寬小，當流量超過上限時，所有Packet Loss都會發生在VBN上，再利用VBN的排
程機制達到有效控制SVC Stream的影片品質。 
利用中間節點調整SBR: Zhao[6] Griwodz[7] Jin[8]將Stream Merging，以達到節省網路頻
寬的目的。Kultida Rojviboonchai等人[9]提出由router負責偵測各條路徑的狀況，並回報
給傳送端，這樣一來傳送端即可根據各路徑的狀況，選擇一個適合的傳送路徑。Shiwen Mao
等人[10]提出將一個影音串流分成多個部份，不同部份使用不同路徑傳送，傳送期間可以隨
時增加一條傳送路徑或是刪除一條已知的傳送路徑，等接收端收到封包後，再把資料組合回
來，用以解決網路瓶頸（Bottleneck）壅塞的問題。E. Kurutepe等人[11]提出可以動態抽取
出不同層的SVC Stream，至於傳送端需抽取哪些Layers傳送出去，則是依據接收端發出的RTCP
封包內容來決定。Peng Chen等人[12]在網路中指定一個節點，透過網際網路傳送擁有
Temporal Scalability功能的影音串流，使得SVC影音串流可以根據網路頻寬大小調整Layer
的數目，以達到調節影音串流的目的，如此可以減少網路頻寬的浪費並具體改進了影音的品
質。Che-Min Lin等人[13]提出如何挑選網路中效能較好的節點來當作Media Relay Node
（MRN），利用廣播Base Layer的封包，與群播MRN Enhancement Layer的封包來達到動態調
整Stream Bit Rate（SBR）。 
其它 SVC 影音串流的相關研究: 在 SVC Encoder/Decoder 的實做方面，最受歡迎的軟體首推
Joint Scalable Video Model（JSVM）[14]，JSVM 是根據 SVC 影音編碼所開發的軟體，它可
將 YUV編碼為三種 SVC 影音格式：Spatial Scalability、Quality Scalability、Temporal 
Scalability，並且可以從 SVC 影音格式中抽取出使用者設定的部份層級，解碼後可得到不同
品質的 YUV 影像。此外關於 Real-time Encoder 與 Rate Control 的研究，Mathias Wien 等
人[15]設計出 Real-time Encoder，其論文中指出能將 Frame Rate 為 25，與 CIF（352×288）
大小的影片，即時壓成 Frame Rate 為 12.5，QCIF （176×144） 大小的影片。Marc Jacobs

圖 4-1  Stream Splitting 的流程 
Stream Merging  
圖 4-2說明 Stream Merging 的詳細流程，因前面步驟（攔截 Request From Client、攔
截 BRM、Forward Video Streaming to Client）與 Stream Splitting 一樣，因此我們省略
這些步驟，直接從流程方塊中的第四個詳述起。SSG使用每五秒鐘攔截到 Client 1發出的 RTCP 
Receiver Report 來計算 Client 2 的可用頻寬，其計算方式如公式（4.1）。若尚有可用頻寬
（如圖 4-2 中的第五個流程方塊，AB > 0），則 SSG查看 Stream 1的 BRM，確定目前的可用
頻寬（AB）可增加幾個 Layers，其計算方式如公式（4.2），或參考圖 4-2 的倒數第二個流
程方塊。在確定可增加的 Layers 數後，SSG把這些 Layers 與 Stream 2 Merge 在一起送給 
Client 2，我們假設要 Merge 的 Layers 數目為 K，K = n-m，其中 n 代表 Stream 1的 Layers
數目，m 代表 Stream 2 的 Layers 數目。 
 (a) 傳送兩條 3 Layers 的 Streams    (b)傳送一條 3 Layers 的 Stream 並使用 Splitting

圖 5-1 Stream Splitting 對 WiMAX 網路頻寬的影響 
  接下來我們針對 Splitting機制在不同 Background Traffic干擾下呈現 Stream 2 的畫
面品質，依序為：男孩站在電梯裡、男孩按下遙控器、女孩站在柱子旁、片頭曲結束畫面，
圖 5-2 為 Background Traffic = 24 Mbps 下的畫面呈現，此時由於可用頻寬皆可 Split 4個
Layers (BL + EL-1 + EL-2 + EL-3)，所以可以看到畫面都很清晰。圖5-3為Background Traffic 
增加為 26 Mbps 下的畫面呈現，此時的可用頻寬只能 Split 一層 BL、或兩層 BL + EL-1影像
串流，可以看到畫面比圖 5-2 模糊許多。 
實驗二 : Stream Merging 
  為了更能突顯 Merged Layer 數多寡，對 Buffer Delay、Queue Length 與 Merged Packets
數量…等參數變化程度的影響，我們使用包括 BL 到 EL-5 共 6 層的影片來實驗 Stream 
Merging。接下來針對 Stream Merging 中的 Case 1，也就是 Layer 數多的 Stream 比較快的
狀況來做量測與結果分析。圖 5-4為 CM Buffer Delay 的量測結果，首先可以看到圖中有兩
條線段，一開始兩條線段重疊，但在第 120K 個 Packets 開始可以明顯看到，Merge 到 EL-5
的Packets的 CM Buffer Delay開始逐漸高於Merge到 EL-1的，到最後Merge到 EL-5與Merge
到 EL-1的 Delay差距已達 480 ms，造成這段時間差距的原因是，Merge 5個 Layer 與 Merge 
1個 Layer 的 Processing Delay 不同，隨著 Merge 的 Packet 數目持續增加，Processing Delay
開始出現明顯的差距。此外我們看到圖中的最左邊，兩條線段並不是從第 0個 Packet開始出
現量測數據，原因是當 Stream 2 要求與 Stream 1 相同的影音串流且尚有可用頻寬時，SSG
會從 Stream 1的第 6K個 Packet開始進行 Merge，即約從 Stream 1影片的第 11 秒開始。 
 
 
前已播放的時間，Y軸為目前 CM Queue Length。我們觀察到 Merge up to EL-5(Merge 5層)
的 Packet 數一開始就多於 Merge up to EL-1的 Packet 數(Merge 1層)，那是因為 Merge 5
層的 Bit Rate 本來就比 Merge 1層高，又我們從圖 4-18 已知 Merge 5層的平均每個 Frame
的 Packet 數比 Merge 1層的 Packet 數平均多 5倍，故在圖 5-5可驗證 Merge 5層的曲線，
的確約是 Merge 1層曲線的 6倍。另外我們也觀察到，此兩條曲線高低走向一致，那是因為
這是同一部影片，當目前傳送到影片 Bit rate高的地方時，Server單位時間傳送的 Packet
數就多，於是產生如第 8分鐘時 Queue 中 Packets 突然變多的狀況，而第 8分鐘後曲線又往
下掉的原因是因為前面 Bit rate 比較高的 Frames已離開 Queue，而目前影片正傳送 Bit Rate
相對低的部份，於是單位時間進 Queue 的 Packets 較少故 CM Queue Length 會變短。 
 
圖 5-5 CM Queue Length 
  圖 5-6為 Aggregated CM Merged Packets，我們量測每分鐘被 Merge 的 Stream 1 Packets
並累計加總， 可以看到 Merge 5個 Layer 與 Merge 1個 Layer 之間原本差距只有 2倍多，到
影片結束差距已達 6倍。差距的拉大，是因為 Merge 5個 Layers 的 Packets 本來就比 Merge 
1個 Layer 多，隨這時間的增加，差距自然越來越大。

Abstract - In this paper, we design and develop a dual-tunnel scheme by setting up a secondary tunnel such that HA can 
perform load sharing by splitting and redirecting video packets from the primary tunnel to the secondary tunnel when the 
former encounters extremely high traffic load. The splitting of MPEG-4 video streams is performed progressively based 
on their frame types, I, B, and P; i.e., splitting B and P-frames first, and followed by even-numbered I-frames. Video 
receiver at MN will have to merge these divided video packets and then playback the video stream utterly. For the 
purpose of demonstration, we implement the dual-tunnel schemes on Linux platform. Experiments are conducted with 
different scenarios of stream splitting by varying the ratio of on-off background traffic. From the experimental results, 
we prove that the proposed dual-tunnel schemes can significantly improve the quality of video streams even under 
severe traffic load.  
Keywords: Mobile IP, Wireless handoff, Dual tunnels, Load sharing, MPEG-4, Stream splitting and merging 
 
2. VOP in MPEG-4  
Different from the traditional encoding scheme, a video picture in MPEG-4 [14] is divided into many different 
video objects (VO). Each VO is then compressed into three types of Video Object Plane (VOP), I-VOP, B-VOP, and 
P-VOP. Similar to I, B, and P frame in MPEG-2, I-VOP can be decoded independently, while P-VOP will have to 
rely on I-VOP or other P-VOP, and B-VOP will have to rely on I-VOP and P-VOP. Thus, among the three types of 
VOP, I-VOP is considered as the most important one for decoder to playback the original MPEG stream. Delivering a 
video stream with these three types of VOP frames from a server to a client over IP network requires the 
encapsulation process. Figure 1 shows how I-VOP frames be segmented into IP packets to adapt to an MTU 
(Maximum Transfer Unit) of a physical network. 
 
 
 
Figure 1 I-VOP encapsulated within IP packets 
 
As illustrated in Figure 1, the start code (0x000001B6) within the MPEG-4 header is used to determine the 
beginning of an I-VOP frame. Unfortunately, the start code exists only in the first IP packet after segmentation. Thus, 
to reassemble all the segmented IP packets into the original I-VOP frame, a receiver will have to examine the 32-bit 
RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) timestamp of every IP packet, for the packets belonging to the same VOP frame 
all possess the same RTP timestamp. Additional, to determine whether the packet is the last one of a VOP frame, the 
one-bit marker, denoting the end of a video frame, is examined. 
3. Stream splitting and merging 
In Today’s Mobile IP, there exists a single tunnel between FA and HA, which may become performance 
bottleneck if high-quality video streams are delivered over the single tunnel. Thus, this Section aims at designing an 
effective stream splitting and merging (SSM) scheme over multiple tunnels during handoff. 
3.1 Network topology 
Figure 2 shows the topology of stream splitting and merging by setting up a secondary tunnel in addition to the 
primary tunnel. As illustrated, when MN moves away from its HA and approaches to an area where many FAs signals 
can be sensed. FA with the strongest signal will be selected by MN to acquire its CoA, through which the primary 
tunnel is built. When the traffic on the primary tunnel increases very quickly and exceeds the tunnel capacity, an FA 
with the second strongest signal is in charge of setting up the secondary tunnel with HA to share the load. 
 
WHILE (1) { 
IF (receive_advertisement())  
{// If a received Advertisement Broadcast message 
IF(advertisement_from_ha())  
// Identify whether it is from HA or not 
update_mn_location();  // Update MN Location 
IF(advertisement_from_fa())  
{// Identify whether it is from FA or not 
IF (get_mn_location() == leave_ha)  
{// If MN is leaving HA 
IF (registed_coa < 2) 
// If the number of registered CoA is less than 2 
register_coa(); // Register CoA}}}  
ELSE  
update_mn_location();     
// Update MN location 
} 
 
Figure 4 Operations of a mobile node 
As shown in Figure 4, an MN will first determine whether the advertisement message is from HA or FA. If MN 
has moved away from HA, it will register two CoAs from two different FA, respectively. As shown in Figure 5, HA 
first periodically broadcast advertisement message, and at the same time it receives CoA binding message from FA. 
HA then builds the primary tunnel for the first CoA binding, and in turn builds the secondary tunnel for the second 
CoA. At last, HA reroutes packets to MN through the primary and the secondary tunnels by classifying VOP frame. 
 
WHILE(1) { 
broadcast_advertisement(); // Broadcast advertisement 
IF (receive_register())  
{// If  a received registration message 
IF(registed_coa() < 2)  
{// If the number of registered CoA is less than 2 
IF (!pri_tun_exist()) {// If the primary tunnel not setup 
setup_pri_tun(); // Set up the primary tunnel 
re-route_pkt_to_pri_coa(); 
// Reroute packets to the primary tunnel 
} ELSE {// If the primary tunnel has been setup 
setup_sec_tun(); // Set up the secondary tunnel 
re-route_pkt_to_sec_coa();  
// Reroute packet to the secondary tunnel 
}} 
IF (pri_tun_exist() && sec_tun_exist())  
// If these two tunnels have been setup 
activate_stream_split_mechanism();  
Figure 5 Operations of HA 
3.2.2 VOP classification algorithm 
 
The start code of MPEG-4 header can be used to classify the three types of VOP. As shown in Table 1, I-VOP has 
two start codes, 0x000001B3 and 0x000001B6 with next 2 bits 00, while P-VOP and B-VOP has the same start code 
0x000001B6 but different in the next two bits (01 for P-VOP and 10 for B-VOP). It is noticed that a VOP may 
consists of more than one IP packets. 
 
 
 
 
4.   Implementations and analyses 
Figure 8 shows the topology of experiments. Initially, MN is connected to HA over wireless link (IEEE 802.11g). 
MN then moves into the overlapping area of FA-1 and FA-2. To purposely vary the traffic load on FA-1, background 
traffic is generated by a notebook PC by passing through a Hub to FA-1. Note that in the topology, six different IP 
networks are used (i.e., 192.168.0.0/24 to 192.168.5.0/24) to demonstrate the handoff of an MN while receiving video 
streams. Figure 9 shows the flow chart of the proposed SSM modules inserted through Pre-routing, one of the 
Net-filter hook [15] provided by Linux kernel for external interface. Developed new SSM modules are described one 
by one as below. 
1. ip_dest_match( ): Packet received from ip_rev( ) are examined whether its destination address matches with MN’s. 
2. ip_dest_swarp_PT( ): If the destination address of an IP packet matches with IP address of MN, the destination 
address is swapped with the CoA of the primary tunnel. 
3. mepg4_match( ): With this module, IP packets can be differentiated by I/P/B-VOP. Thus, B-VOP and P-VOP 
packets are redirected to the secondary tunnel, if traffic load on FA-1 has exceeded the minimum threshold.  
4. ip_dest_swarp_ST( ): If the destination address of an IP packet matches with the IP address of MN, the destination 
address is swapped with the CoA of the secondary tunnel. 
 
i_frame_odd_even_process() { 
IF (is_odd_i_frame) {// If it is an odd-numbered 
odd_i_frame_timestamp = rtp_timestamp; 
// Record the timestamp of an odd-numbered I-frame 
RETURN odd_i_frame_match();  
} ELSE 
{// If it is an even-numbered 
even_i_frame_timestamp = rtp_timestamp; 
// Record the timestamp of an even-numbered  I-frame 
RETURN even_i_frame_match();    
}}

Figure 11 Bit rates versus background traffic  
 
 
Figure 12 Bit rate variations on the secondary tunnel 
 
Figure 12 shows the bit rate variations on the secondary tunnel between state-2 and state-3. During the 480-sec 
experiment, the total amount of data received at FA-2 is 511.84 Mbits for state-2, and it is 547.93 Mbits for stste-3. If 
we deduct the second number from the first number, the difference is the size of even-numbered I-VOP frames, which 
are split from the primary to the secondary tunnel. 
Finally, by increasing the ratio of background traffic from 10% to 100%, Figure 13 shows the percentage of I, B, 
P-VOP frames received from the secondary tunnel. When the ratio of on-off traffic is smaller than 30%, it is observed 
that no     I-VOP frames are redirected to the secondary tunnel. However, the percentage of I-VOP frames received 
from the secondary tunnel increases gradually when the ratio of on-off traffic increases. In fact, it is about 49% of 
I-VOP frames and about 96% of B/P-VOP frames, which are redirected to the secondary tunnel when the ratio 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have presented a stream splitting and merging scheme for Mobile-IP with dual tunnels to share 
the load when network traffic becomes severely congested. To build the secondary tunnel in addition to the primary 
tunnel, we have modified Today’s mobile IP software so that two different CoAs can be bind concurrently on HA. For 
the purpose of evaluation, we implemented the proposed SSM scheme with dual tunnels on Linux platform. The 
implementations include two new developed C++ modules, the modified mobile IP handoff module, and I, B, and 
P-VOP frame classification module. By purposely injecting different percentages of on-off background traffic on the 
primary tunnel, we observed that, with the proposed SSM scheme, the traffic load on the primary tunnel has been 
evenly split to the secondary tunnel. Because of the load sharing between the two tunnels, video quality can be 
substantially improved even when a mobile node performs handoff in a heavily congested traffic condition.

表 Y04 
1 Introduction 
Due to the fast development in wireless technologies, it has increasing possibility for a small and light mobile device 
(such as cellular phone, PDA, and notebook PC) to move away from its connection through another AP/BS. Thus, a 
mobile device may encounter sudden interruption during handoffs when receiving real-time video streams. Mobile IP 
[1-2] was developed by IETF to support seamless handoffs if an MH (mobile host) lost the connection with the original 
AP (belonging to one IP subnet) and reconnects to another AP (belonging to another IP subnet). In mobile IP, a 
reconnected MH is assigned a CoA (care of address) in a foreign network. Through CoA, the MH can re-establish the 
communication with CN (correspondent node) after home agent (HA) sets up an IP tunnel to foreign agent (FA). Even 
though mobile IP can support seamless handoffs for mobile devices, unfortunately, since only one tunnel at a time can be 
established between HA and FA, a large percentage of video packets over a single IP tunnel could be lost if wireless 
network becomes heavily congested. Consequently, the quality of video streams may be seriously degraded. This paper 
therefore presents a dual-tunnel approach for Mobile IP to offer load sharing by establishing a secondary tunnel in 
addition to the primary tunnel if another FA can be nearby located by MH. 
 
Previous works on improving the quality of video streaming over wireless networks during handoffs include 
different aspects. Kashibuchi et al. [3] proposed a method to improve video quality during handoff. By predicting when 
to handoff using a modified RTCP report, his method can estimate the amount of bandwidth available to the MN after 
handoff. To overcome the problem of fast moving speed, Chao et al. [4] proposed a new handoff strategy to minimize 
the ping-pong effect between two base stations. Similarly, Mohanty et al. [5] proposed a method that combines layer-2 
signal strength and layer-3 parameters to improve handoff efficiency. 
 
Other than the improvement of handoff efficiency, many papers have focused on load sharing by dividing a video 
stream into many sub-streams. Tu et al. [6] proposed a method of adaptive split transmission for video streams in 
wireless mesh networks. Based on the estimation of available bandwidth, his method can determine whether splitting a 
video stream into several sub-streams is substantially helpful. By fully utilizing the multi-layer characteristics of 
MPEG-4, Chilamkurti et al. [7-9] improved video quality through FEC (Forward Error Correction) techniques. Pan et al. 
[10] proposed an end-to-end multipath smooth handoff scheme for video streaming. The basic idea behind his approach 
is to duplicate the critical data, such as I-frames, and then place these critical data on different multiple paths. To deal 
with load sharing over multiple paths, Leung et al. [11-12] proposed two algorithms. The first algorithm is to divide the 
traffic based on the relative importance of data packets. The second algorithm, on the contrary, is to weight the multiple 
paths for different traffic loads. Finally, Son et al. [13] proposed a soft load-balancing scheme, with which IP packets 
can be split evenly and placed over multiple paths. 
 
The main goal of this paper, different from the previous works, is to build a secondary tunnel for Mobile IP to offer 
load sharing when the primary tunnel gets congested. Thus, one of the novelties presented by this paper is to split video 
streams over two Mobile-IP tunnels by classifying MPEG frame types, I, B, and P. The splitting of video streams is 
performed progressively along with the increasing traffic; i.e., splitting B and P-frames first, and then followed by 
even-numbered I-frames. Video receiver at MN will have to merge these divided video packets and playback the video 
stream successively. For the purpose of demonstration, we implement the dual-tunnel schemes on Linux platform. 
Experiments are conducted with different scenarios of stream splitting by varying the ratio of on-off background traffic 
on the primary tunnel. 
 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce VOP (Video Object Planes) of 
MPEG-4 and Mobile IP. In Section 3, we present the proposed stream splitting and merging (SSM) scheme with dual 
tunnels. In Section 4, the implementations on Linux platform is described, and experimental results are discussed. 
Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 5.

3.2 The proposed SSM algorithms 
To split video stream on HA and merge the stream on MN, we propose the stream splitting and merging (SSM) 
algorithms as shown in Figure 3. Three states exist in the proposed SSM algorithm state-1 (S1) represents the normal 
traffic condition, i.e., stream splitting is not required. State-2 (S2) is the state when queue length of FA has exceeded the 
first threshold (qlen_threshold_A) beyond which video quality is degraded. Thus, the proposed SSM algorithm will 
begin to split P and B-VOP from the original stream and place them on the established secondary tunnel. When traffic 
load on the primary tunnel continues to increase and the queue length of FA has exceeded the second threshold 
(qlen_threshold_B), the system changes from moderate traffic load to severe traffic load. Thus, State-3 (S3) represents 
the condition where I-VOP may be dropped due to severe traffic load on the primary tunnel. At this moment, SSM 
begins to place even-numbered I-VOP on the secondary tunnel. Finally, when the queue length of FA drops below 
qlen_threshold_A, the system automatically goes back to the normal state (S1). Thus, the proposed SSM consists of two 
sub-algorithms to be performed on HA.  
1. Modified handoff scheme, 
2. Classification of VOP frames.

In this case, the start code exists only in the first IP packet. Thus, no start codes can be used to distinguish the VOP 
types for the rest of IP packets of the same VOP. Fortunately, we observe that all the IP packets of the same VOP 
possess the same timestamp within RTP header. Hence, split a video stream into two sub-streams based on VOP types 
becomes possible when network becomes congested. Figure 6 shows the VOP classification performed by HA. As it can 
be observed, start codes and RTP timestamps are used to classify different VOPs. Additionally when network becomes 
severely congested, as shown in Figure 7, the proposed SSM will switch from S2 to S3. At S3, I-VOP is further 
classified into two types; even-numbered and odd-numbered I-VOP. Even-numbered I-VOP will be redirected to the 
secondary tunnel, while odd-numbered I-VOP will stay in the primary tunnel.

Figure 9 Developed SSM modules on Linux 
Two experiments are performed. The first experiment observes the improvement of video quality when the proposed 
SSM with dual tunnels is employed. The second experiment estimates how many percentages of I, B, and P-VOP frames 
being split to the secondary tunnel when different ratios of on-off background traffic are generated.  
 
HA will periodically detect the queue length of FA-1, where background traffic is generated by iperf [16] through a 
hub in an on-off fashion. Initially, HA remains in state-1 (S1), and it will enter state-2 (S2) when the queue length of 
FA-1 exceeds 30,000 bytes. At this time, the SSM algorithm is invoked to split B and P-VOP to the secondary tunnel. 
When the queue length of FA-1 continues to increase and exceeds 50,000 bytes, the system enters state-3 (S3). At S3, 
only odd-numbered I-VOP frame remains in the primary tunnel, while B, P, and even-numbered I-VOP frames are split 
to the secondary tunnel. 
 
Table 2 shows the number and size of I, P, B-VOP frames of a video film used in the experiment. As an example, if 
I-VOP frames of the film are examined, there are total 806 frames with total frame size 9,184,548 bytes. The 806 I-VOP 
frames are segmented into 6,534 IP packets with average packet size 1,405.65 bytes. To compare the difference in video 
quality, Figure 10 (a) shows four consecutive frames by using the proposed SSM with dual tunnels, while Figure 10 (b) 
shows the same consecutive four frames without employing the SSM. As it can be observed from the figures, mosaic and 
lag phenomenon in Figure 10 (b) was removed and video quality is improved.

Figure 11 validates the effect of stream splitting and merging. By increasing the ratio of on-off background traffic on 
FA-1 from 10% to 100%, bit rates over the primary tunnel has been decreased from 1270 Kbps down to 1160 Kbps; it is 
about 113 Kbps traffic load relief in the primary tunnel. 
 
表 Y04 
I-VOP frames are redirected to the secondary tunnel. However, the percentage of I-VOP frames received from the 
secondary tunnel increases gradually when the ratio of on-off traffic increases. In fact, it is about 49% of I-VOP frames 
and about 96% of B/P-VOP frames, which are redirected to the secondary tunnel when the ratio increases to 100%. From 
the percentage of I, B, and P-VOP frames received from the secondary tunnel, we also found out that it is about 1% of 
I-VOP frames and 4% of B/P-VOP frames lost during the wireless handoff.
