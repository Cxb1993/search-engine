Abstract
In this report, we present novel model-based schemes for estimating correlated down-
link multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. Our schemes are based on
an analytic model which encompasses the popular Kronecker model and the more gen-
eral Weichselberger model as special cases. This model yields a compact representation
for correlated channels. When the transmit antenna array is such that the associated
MIMO channel has a small angle spread, our model admits a reduced-rank representa-
tion and allows an estimator to extract useful information such as the transmitter’s angle
of departure (AOD), which can be useful for potential post-processing applications.
We develop iterative algorithms for estimating static and time-varying channels,
respectively. These algorithms yield fast convergence rates and offer excellent mean
squared identification error (MSIE) performance for both block fading and frequency-
selective fading channels.

Introduction
Increasing demand for higher wireless system capacity has catalyzed several ground-
breaking transmission techniques among which the multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO)
technologies have attracted most of the recent attention. It has been shown that, in
comparison with the conventional single antenna systems, significant capacity gains are
achievable when multielement antennas (MEA) are used at both the transmit and re-
ceive sides [1]. Spatial multiplexing techniques, for example, the BLAST (Bell-labs
Layered Space-Time) system, were developed to attain very high spectral efficiencies in
rich scattering environments.
Ideal rich-scattering environments decorrelate channels between different pairs of
transmit and receive antennas so that maximum number of orthogonal subchannels is
available. In practice, however, spatial correlations do exist and should be considered in
designing an MIMO receiver and evaluating the corresponding system performance [2].
Spatial correlation depends on physical parameters such as antenna spacing, antenna
arrangement, and scatters’ distributions. Antenna correlations reduce the number of
equivalent orthogonal subchannels, decrease the spectral efficiency, and make it more
difficult to detect the transmit data [1].
A coherent MIMO receiver needs an accurate channel estimate to carry out some
critical operations and to provide satisfactory performance. Having a reliable channel
estimator that takes into account the channel correlation is thus a critical part of the

Modelling of Correlated MIMO
Channels
2.1 System Setup
Fig. 5.1 shows the setup of a MIMO system under consideration. The base station
(BS) and a mobile station (MS) are equipped with linear arrays of M and N antennas,
respectively. Independent data streams x(t) = [x1(t), x2(t), x3(t), · · · , xM(t)]
T are trans-
mitted from the BS at time t, where xm(t) denotes the source signal of the mth transmit
antenna and the superscript T denotes vector (matrix) transposition. At the MS, the
baseband received signals are given by y(t) = [y1(t), y2(t), y3(t), · · · , yN(t)]
T , where yn(t)
is the signal received by the nth receive antenna at time t. For notational simplicity,
we define the two M -dimensional vectors xi = x(i4t) and yi = y(i4t) where 4t is the
sampling interval. Without loss of generality, we assume that E{xix
H
i } = IM ,∀ i, where
IK is the K ×K identity matrix. The superscript H denotes conjugate transposition.
We consider a typical urban macrocellular environment in which an MS is surrounded
by local scatterers and waveforms impending the receive antennas are richly scattered
while the BS is unobstructed by local scatterers. Such an operating environment can be
suitably characterized by the “one-ring” model proposed in [2],[4]. In Fig. 1, ∆ denotes
the azimuthal angle spread at the BS and φ denotes the mean angle of departure (AOD)
between BS and MS. The inter-element distance is denoted as d.

Weichselberger models [11]. We present a new modelling scheme that encompasses both
Kronecker and Weichselberger models as special cases. The proposed model imposes
fewer constraints and involves much less parameters than other models based on the
system setting described in Section II.A. These features make it possible to devise sim-
ple and accurate model-based channel estimators.
Our model derivation begins with the Kronecker model and proceeds to demonstrate
that the resulting representation is valid for the Weichselberger model if the constraint
on the structure of the parametric random matrix in our model is relaxed.
The Kronecker model assumes separable statistics at the transmitter and receiver so
that the spatial correlation matrix Φ of vec(H), vec(·) being the stacking operator, is
given by the Kronecker product (⊗) of those of the transmit (ΦBS) and receive (ΦMS)
antennas,
Φ = ΦMS ⊗ΦBS = Φ

Using a similar approximation for Φ

MS leads to
Φ1/2 ≈ (WQBSΛBS)⊗ (QMSΛMS) = (WQBS ⊗QMS) (ΛBS ⊗ΛMS) , (2.15)
where we have invoked the identity [15],
(A1 ⊗B1)(A2 ⊗B2) · · · (Ak ⊗Bk) = (A1A2 · · ·Ak)⊗ (B1B2 · · ·Bk). (2.16)
From the canonical representation, vec(H) = Φ

vec(H) ≈ (WQBS ⊗QMS) (ΛBS ⊗ΛMS) vec(Hw)

= (WQBS ⊗QMS) vec(Ccoef). (2.17)

or, if ∆H denotes the modelling error,
H = QMSCcoefQ

The above derivation assumes that the spatial correlation functions for MEA at BS or
MS are approximated by suitable polynomial bases. Since the resulting basis vectors
are likely to have different norms and might result in numerical instability, we assume
that orthonormal polynomial or discrete cosine bases are used so that QMS and QBS are
M ×KT and N ×KR orthogonal matrices, and

spread 4 becomes large, the rank of C increases and there is no dominant spatial angle.
The steering matrix W becomes an identity matrix which carries no information about
spatial angle any more, and we have Ω˜V = C,UBS = QBS and UMS = QMS.
Since QMS and QBS are given and fixed, identification of the unknown channel H
is equivalent to the estimation of W and C, which usually has a lower rank and much
smaller number of entries than those of H for the link environment of interest. Thus,
using the model (2.21) reduces the channel estimator’s complexity and enhance its per-
formance.

where N = [n1,n2, · · · ,nB] is the corresponding noise matrix whose entries are i.i.d.

where, as mentioned before, QM,KT and QN,KR are known, we express the corresponding
optimal (least-squares) channel estimate in terms of Wopt and Copt
Hopt = QN,KRCoptQM,KT
TWopt (3.3)
Hence we rewrite (3.1) as
Y = HoptX + ∆HX + N
def
= HoptX + N
′, (3.4)
where N′ represents the sum of the modelling error ∆HX and the AWGN vector, N.
To derive an iterative algorithm for obtaining the joint directional and channel solution
{Wopt,Hopt}, we assume that, at the (i− 1)th iteration,
Y = Ĥi−1X + ∆Ĥi−1X + N
′ (3.5)
where ∆Ĥi−1
def
= Hopt−Ĥi−1 is the residual error at the end of the (i−1)th iteration, and
consider the estimation of the channel (coefficients) and AOD in two separate phases.
Phase I - Coefficient Estimation
Assume that the directional matrix in this phase is optimum, i.e., W = Wopt . From
(2.21), (3.1) and (16)–(2.18), we have
vec(Y) = (XT ⊗ IN)vec(H) + vec(N)
=
[
(WoptX)
T ⊗ IN
]
(QM,KT ⊗QN,KR)vec(C) + vec(N)
=
{[
(WoptX)
TQM,KT
]
⊗QN,KR
}
vec(C) + vec(N). (3.6)
Substituting the definition
Z
def
= ((WoptX)
TQM,KT )⊗QN,KR (3.7)
11
where † denotes matrix pseudoinverse. As Copt is unavailable, we replace Copt by the
previous estimate Ĉi−1 for computing G during the ith iteration and update Ŵi by
adding the correction term ∆Ŵi−1 to the previous estimate Ŵi−1. Combining both
phases, we summarize the proposed channel estimation algorithm in Table (I). Numer-
ical experiment indicates that this algorithm converges very fast, requiring less than 3
iterations in most cases. Although Algorithm A has the advantages of simplicity and
fast convergence, the estimated directional matrix Ŵ, however, is not of the diagonal
form specified by (2.11). Additional steps are needed if the AOD information contained
in Ŵi is desired.
Algorithm B - Maximum Matching Output To estimate Ŵi in diagonal form,
we start with the following lemma.
Lemma 1 For two matrices A and B of size N ×M and M × J respectively, and an
arbitrary vector c of size M × 1, the following identity holds.
vec (A · diag(c) ·B) =
[
(1E ⊗A)
(
BT ⊗ 1N
)]
c, (3.12)
where “diag” denotes the diagonal operation used to translate a vector into a diagonal
matrix with its diagonal terms being the elements of the original vector in the successive
order. Operator  denotes the Hadamard product operation.
proof: See Appendix B.
Combining with the matrix G defined in Algorithm A, (3.4) is rewritten as
Y = GWoptX + N
′. (3.13)
Let wopt be the column vector that consists of the diagonal elements of Wopt, i.e.,
wopt(i) = Wopt(i, i), for any 1 ≤ i ≤ M . Then, by Lemma 1, we have
vec (Y) =
[
(1E ⊗G)
(
XT ⊗ 1N

wopt + vec (N

delay profiles for the sub-channels between transmit and receive pairs are independent
but of the same form. With a sampling interval of 4t = T the receive signals at time
nT can be written as
Yn =
L−1∑
l=0
H(l)n X
(l)
n + Nn (3.18)
where Yn = Y(nT ) is the N × J receive vector at time nT , X
(l)
n = X(nT − lT ) is the
M ×J transmit block at time (n− l)T , and E denotes the length of training block. H
(l)
n
is the N×M matrix whose (i, j)th entry represents the fading coefficient of the lth path
at time nT for the channel between the ith transmit and jth receive antennas.
In the estimation of the time-variant fading MIMO channel, an observation window
is included to take into account the channel variation. For an observation window of size
B, the stacked receive sample vector from time nT to (n + B− 1)T can be expressed as
Yn,B
def
= [Yn,Yn+1, . . . ,Yn+B−1] . (3.19)
Applying (2.18) to the stacked version of (3.18), we have

W is the steering matrix defined in (2.11). Since the mean AOD usually varies slowly
with respect to a subchannel’s coherent time, we assume that the steering matrix W is
the same during a period of B data blocks. Similar to the narrowband model (21), we
do not impose the implicit Kronecker structure and Gaussian assumption on c˜coef.
As (3.30) can be obtained by replacing X, Y, W, vec(C), QM,KT , and QN,KR in (3.6)
by Xn,B, Yn,B, W
′, c˜coef, Q˜BS, and QMS, we conclude that both block fading and time
variant frequency selective fading channels can be described by similar models. Hence,
the two-phase iterative estimation scheme developed in Section III-A can be extended
to estimate the coefficient vector c˜coef, and the directional matrix W
′ in (3.30). In the
following, we describe our two-phase channel estimation approach for frequency-selective
time-variant fading channels.
Phase I - Coefficient Estimation
With an argument similar to that used in Section III-A, we assume that the directional
matrix W′ is optimal in the coefficient estimation phase and define
Z˜
def
=
(
(W′optXn,B)
T Q˜BS

The LS estimate of c˜coef is
̂˜ccoef = (Z˜HZ˜)−1Z˜Hvec (Yn,B) def= F˜ (W′opt), (3.32)

(
XTn,B ⊗ 1N
))
(1BL ⊗ IM)w
def
= T˜w. (3.36)
Similar to Algorithm B presented in the previous subsection, the LS estimate of wopt is
ŵLS = T˜
† · vec(Yn,B). To improve the estimate and reconstruct a steering vector ŵ,
we analogously define a steering vector v(θ)
def
=
[
1, v(θ), · · · , vM−1(θ)
]T
, where v(θ) =
exp(−j2pi d
λ
sin(θ)). The AOD information φ̂ can be retrieved by
φ̂ = arg max
−pi≤θ≤pi
Re
{
ŵHLSv(θ)
}
. (3.37)
Having obtained φ̂, we then proceed to compute Ŵ′ = IBL ⊗ V(φ̂), where V(φ̂) =
diag(v(φ̂)).
Algorithm C - Root-Finding Method The root-finding approach for the block
fading case can be used as well. It is easy to see that (3.37) is equivalent to searching
for the root of the correlation polynomial P (z) which is the closest to the unit circle,
i.e.,
ẑ = arg minz ||z| − 1|
subject to: P (z)

and then retrieving the AOD information from ẑ = exp

matrix is to be reconstructed by Ŵ′ = I⊗ diag(ẑ), where ẑ = [1, ẑ, . . . , ẑM−1].

where P⊥
Z
= I−Z(ZHZ)−1Z. The above equation indicates that, besides the terms that
have to do with the noise N, the coefficient vector estimation error is determined by the
projection error ∆Z. Hence, when the projection error ∆W is small (and thus ∆Z is
small), vec(Ĉ) is a good approximation of vec(C) at high SNR region.
Let the compound modelling order Ks be equal to (KT + 1)(KR + 1) and (KT +
1)(KR + 1)(KB + 1)L for block fading channel and frequency selective fading channel,
respectively. Considering the case that K < k ≤ Ks < χ, eigenvalues {λk}

Thus when the modelling order is chosen larger than the rank of Rh, the modelling
error, h, is negligible. In contrast, if the modelling order is not enough to span the
signal space of the channel covariance matrix there will be a underorder modelling error

which will dominate the MS error performance when the AWGN is small enough (high

Next, consider the second term in (4.4), and assume the training signal Xp and the
noise matrix N are statistically independent. The error term contributed by the thermal
noise can be easily calculated as

the directional matrix W which is a representative of the equivalence class {W + w0},
where w0 lie in the null space of QM,KT . A proper AOD estimator can be derived from
the projection QTM,KT W; see Fig. 4 for the resulting AOD estimator performance.
As the angle spread ∆ increases, correlation between the transmit antennas dimin-
ishes. A higher modelling order is necessary to describe the rapid changing waveform
at the transmit side. Dotted curves in Fig. 3 are the performance of an 8 × 8 MIMO
system with AOD= 45◦ and angle spread ∆ = 15◦ when the channel undergoes block
fading and has an approximated rank equal to 4. Since the processing dimension (mod-
elling order) is small in the case of highly correlated MEA at the BS, the number of
length-M training symbol vectors, B, can be less than 3 when ∆ = 2◦, and will be
greater than 3 when ∆ = 15◦. Fig. 5 plots the real part of original and estimate channel
response, which indicate that bases of order less than 3 tend to incur larger modelling
errors while those of order larger or equal to 3 provide satisfactory performance. Such
a behavior coincides with the performance analysis given in the section IV. Similar to
other model-based approach, modelling error dominates the performance in high SNR
scenarios.
Fig. 6 compares the MSE performance of Algorithms B and C, which both give
satisfied estimation after 10 iterations. Algorithm B searches the maximum matching
output from 200 candidate phases that are uniformly distributed in θ ∈ [−pi, pi) while
Algorithm C finds the desired phase by solving a polynomial directly. The latter yields
better performance for having a larger probability of locating the true maximum. Al-
though the convergence rate of Algorithms A is faster than that of Algorithm A or B,
the latter two algorithms give direct estimate of the AOD without extra post processing.
The MSE performance of Algorithm C in a frequency-selective time-variant fading
channel similar to that of [3] is illustrated in Fig. 7. The power delay profile of the
independent six delay pathes is given by [0, −1, −9, −10, −15, −20] dB with relative
delays at [0, 310, 710, 1090, 1730, 2510] nanoseconds, KB = 2, the vehicle speed is

Appendix B
Proof of Lemma 1
Proof:
According to the Lemma 5.1.3 in [15], we know that the ith entry of the vector[(
(1E ⊗A) (B
T ⊗ 1N)
)
c
]
coincides with the (i, i)th diagonal entry of the square ma-
trix
[
(1E ⊗A)diag(c)(B⊗ 1
T
N)
]
, for i = 1, 2, . . . , NE. Define A˜ = [a˜m,n]
def
= (1E ⊗A)
and B˜ = [b˜m,n]
def
= (BT ⊗ 1N). Rewrite i = N(p − 1) + q, for p ∈ {1, . . . , E} and
q ∈ {1, . . . , N}, then
[
(1E ⊗A)diag(c)(B⊗ 1
T
N)
]
i,i
=
M∑
j=1
a˜i,jcj b˜i,j
=
M∑
j=1
aq,jcjbj,p
= [vec (Adiag(c)B)]i , ∀i,
where aq,j is the (q, j)th entry of A and bj,p is the (j, p)th entry of B. [D]i,i denotes the
(i,i)th entry of the matrix D, while [e]i denotes the ith entry of the vector e. Hence we
have [(
(1E ⊗A) (B
T ⊗ 1N)
)
c
]
i
= [vec (Adiag(c)B)]i , ∀i = 1, . . . , NE,
which proves the Lemma 1.
