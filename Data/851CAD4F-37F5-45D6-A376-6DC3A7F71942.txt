中文摘要
研究證明神經導管若於神經修復早期快速排出炎性廢物，即可加速神經再生。
我們早期於在神經導管研究中發現：不對稱神經導管即具有此一優異特性，可保留
NGF、BDNF、ECM 等親神經物質，並在神經修復時加速修復。本實驗將精確製備
不對稱的 PLGA 三種神經導管，分別具備(1)低通透性、(2)單向通透性與 (3) 高通
透性。另外，三種特性之導管亦將製成膜狀，將 Schwann cells 及 Fibriblast cells 植
覆於膜兩側，並將膜培養於新型具兩分離腔室之生物反應器，以進行獨立之觀察與
檢測。實驗結果顯示植覆於單向通透性不對稱膜之細胞，具有較強的細胞活性與低
的細胞死亡率。最後動物實驗的結果亦顯示單向通透性不對稱導管具有較多的
A-type 與 B-type 神經髓鞘數目。

供一個正確的方向。研究證實神經的再生初期 Schwann cell 扮演一個關鍵的引導
角色，並且 Schwann cell 數量與活性對神經再生成功與否極其重要。其關鍵因素
包括：刺激 Schwann cell 分化，增生胞外基質分泌(extracellular matrix, ECM)、增
加神經生長因子 (growth factor, NGF)。然而，據統計移植手術後，植覆的 Schwann
cells 80-90%會持續死亡，增殖力、活性與遷移力亦極低。一般研究只證明導管通
透性愈高對神經修復越好，並未有人分別針對導管的流入與流出通透率(Inflow &
Outflow permeability)進行研究。實際上，神經受損部位一開始時該區域附近充滿
血腫、血塊且近乎發炎，養份廢物經由組織液輸送，導管內外環境亦並不相同，
因此，導管設計時需要針對不同流出與流入通透率進行考量。再者，導管管壁上
的孔洞，可以讓 Schwann cell 以及神經細胞再生過程順利，代謝所產生的大量廢
物加速擴散排放。同時，孔洞大小如能控制一定範圍之下，亦能阻止纖維母細胞
(fibroblast)大量入侵受傷處形成 scar，阻礙神經生長的通道， 或是防止 Schwann
cell 分泌的生長因子或再生神經分泌的 mitogenic factor 從受傷處流失，減慢神經
再生。最近亦有研究顯示，神經受傷處的新生血管生成 (angiogenesis)亦有利於神
經再生。所以，如果導管管壁上的孔洞可以讓附近循環系統的細小微血管延伸到
導管裡面，相信對於神經再生的作用有一定程度的幫助。另外在神經導管修復方
面，神經再生的環境並非只是導管內 Schwann cells 而已，其實導管外 Fibroblast
之細胞數目與活性亦極重要。研究指出，管內大量的 Schwann cells 與管外少量的
Fibroblast 是最佳的神經再生環境。因此，為研究不對稱導管對管內 Schwann cells
與管外 Fibroblast 間交互作用的影響，我們研製一共培養系統（Coculture system）
以模擬神經管修復模式。

後取下坐骨神經的實驗部位(神經導管處)取下，冷凍切片觀察神經導管中近、中、
遠端之生長情況。
四、 結果與討論
圖一為導管植入鼠坐骨神經的動物實驗。(a)手術過程 (b)導管植入。90/10導
管的孔隙度0%, 20%, 95%分別為83.55.3%, 73.64.7%, 66.13.4%，其中可看
出：相同的材質使用較高濃度的乙醇水溶液作為相轉移劑，可以得到較高的孔隙
度，而由掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察導管截面，膜厚平均為55μm，接近管腔表面的孔
洞呈現緻密，孔洞大小約5μm，而靠近管壁外層孔洞較為疏鬆，孔洞大小約20μm，
整體孔洞結構形成非對稱結構(圖二)。而管腔內部表面具有微小緻密的孔洞，可以
讓Schwann 細胞以及神經細胞有良好的再生過程，因為細胞生長時代謝速率提高
有利於因細胞生長而產生的大量廢物擴散排放。同時，能阻止外部纖維母細胞侵
入導管內部形成scar，阻礙神經生長。由圖三可看出，導管的膨潤度與導管材質有
關，可看出有以下的趨勢，PLGA50:50＞PLGA90:10，使用不同濃度的相轉移劑，
14天時高濃度的相轉移劑有較低的膨潤度， 但在21天時觀察，沒有明顯的影響。
而由圖四，部分導管降解速度可看出呈現急速的下降，可能與導管管壁過薄，稱
量時造成誤差所致。由於可降解聚酯在生物體內分解時會形成乳酸及甘醇酸等有
機酸，因此量測磷酸鹽緩衝溶液的pH值變化，亦可作為導管降解程度的參考，由
圖五可看出 90：10-0%、20%及95%沒有出現明顯磷酸鹽緩衝溶液的pH值變化，因
此可判定兩者在生物體內可穩定維持一個月以上。圖六為共培養Schwann cells與

中孔隙度的導管全部或是部份皆已經在體內降解及被吸收，且導管外壁並沒發現
有任何的塌陷；在導管內可見明顯的微血管增生以及具髓鞘之神經再生，且在導
管內沒有發現任何外來的組織。總結以上數據，結果顯示不對稱導管表現優於一
般型導管。

Abstract: The high outflow permeability of the nerve conduit used to emit the drained waste
generated from the traumatized host nerve stump is critical in peripheral nerve regeneration.
Our earlier studies have established that asymmetric conduits fulfill the basic requirements
for use as nerve guide conduits. In this study, the inflow characteristics of optimal nerve
conduits were further examined using in vivo and in vitro trials. Various asymmetric poly(DL-
lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) conduits were controlled by modifying precipitation baths
using 0, 20, and 95% isopropyl alcohol, with high-porosity (permeability), medium-porosity
(high outflow and low inflow), and low-porosity (permeability), respectively. In the in vitro
trial, the Schwann cells and fibroblasts were seeded on either side of the asymmetric PLGA
films in a newly designed coculture system that simulated the repaired nerve conduit
environment. The results of the directional permeable films indicated the statistically
significant proliferation of Schwann cells and the inhibition of the division of fibroblasts in
lactate dehydrogenase release and inhibition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl-
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction, compared with the other films. In the in vivo trial,
the PLGA conduits seeded with Schwann cells were implanted into 10 mm right sciatic nerve
defects in rats. After 6 weeks, implanted conduits were harvested. Histological examination
verified that directional permeable conduits had markedly more A-type and B-type myelin
fibers in the midconduit and distal nerve. In this work, the directional transport
characteristics were established as an extremely important factor to the design and
development of optimal nerve guide conduits in peripheral nerve regeneration. ' 2007 Wiley

INTRODUCTION
Forming a synthetic guidance conduit for repairing periph-
eral nerve defects has received considerable attention.1–5
The entubulation conduit model has been extensively inves-
tigated; in this model, proximal and distal stumps of a
severed nerve are inserted into either end of a hollow tube,
and numerous of the molecular and cellular events that
occur in the regenerating nerve ending have been eluci-
dated. These synthetic conduits can guide axon migration,
maintain regulator factors from the distal stump for contact
with the regenerated axons, and prevent the wound space
from invasion by exogenous cells and tissues.6 Investigators
have hoped to exploit the characteristics of nerve conduits
to promote such regenerative events 7–12.
Numerous tissue-engineering approaches have been de-
monstrated to improve the performance of conduits. They
include the addition of nerve growth factor, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, extracellular matrix, glial growth fac-
tor, and ciliary neurotrophic factors in the hollow conduits,

solution, was immersed in 5 mL of PBS in the vial. About
20 mL of solution was retrieved from the PBS vial and
analyzed using glucose assay and the Bio-Rad agent, after
0.5, 1, 6, 24, and 48 h. Solute concentrations were mea-
sured using a UV spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-2000) at
wavelengths of 500 nm for the glucose assay, and 595 nm
for lysozyme and BSA. The procedure was repeated on the
reverse side of the fabricated ﬁlms to determine the inﬂow
and outﬂow rates of diffusion.
Interaction Between Schwann Cells and Fibroblasts
in a Coculture System
A new coculture system that contained two connected
culture-chambers, separated by an asymmetric ﬁlm with a
diameter of 16 mm (Figure 1) was adopted to simulate the
repaired nerve conduit environment. Schwann cells and
ﬁbroblasts were obtained by a method described in our
earlier work and by Grothe et al.28,29 Schwann cells (5 3
104 cells per specimen) were cultured on the micropore
side of the asymmetric ﬁlm. After 6 h, the same number of
ﬁbroblasts were applied to the other side (macrovoid side).
The culture was maintained in a humid incubator at 378C
with 10% CO2 in air. The culture medians in both cham-
bers were retrieved on days (1, 4, and 7). Then, MTT and
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) testing were performed.
LDH Testing. Cell apoptosis was determined by LDH,
as described by Koh et al.30 After 1, 4, and 7 days, 25 mL/
specimen in the culture medium was retrieved from the
chamber in the coculture system and mixed with LDH
reagent (Promega) in a 1:1 volume ratio in 96-well plates.
The solution was incubated for 30 min at 378C, after which
the change in absorbance (490 nm) was measured in a
microplate reader (Emax).
MTT Testing. MTT assays were performed as described
by Mosman.31 Cell activity was quantiﬁed at 1, 4, and 7
days by using the MTT assays. Brieﬂy, 4 h after the incu-
bation of MTT (Sigma) at 378C, the solution was removed
and the insoluble dark blue formazan product was dissolved
in dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma). Then, 100 mL was aspirated
and poured into another 96-well plate to measure the absor-
bance change at 550 nm using a microplate reader (Emax).
Animal Study
Surgical Procedure. Sprague–Dawley rats (male, weigh-
ing 250–300 g) were deeply anesthetized using sodium
Figure 1. Schematic drawing of the coculture system. The system contained two connected cul-
ture-chambers, separated by a 16-mm diameter of asymmetric ﬁlm. The Schwann cells were cul-
ture on the micropore side of the ﬁlm, after 6 h, the ﬁbroblasts were cultured on the other side
(macrovoid side). Two ends of the coculture system were sealed by 0.22 mm pore ﬁlms to maintain
the gaseous transmission.

metric conduits were elucidated. One-way ANOVA was ap-
plied to LSD to determine its statistical signiﬁcance.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Asymmetric Conduit and Film
In Figure 2(a), the weight loss of all PLGA 90/10 conduits
remained relatively constant throughout the degradation
period. In contrast, PLGA 50/50 conduits underwent much
weight loss after 14 days in PBS, indicating their rapid
degradation. Additionally, little variation was observed
among high, low and medium-porosity conduits at a given
copolymer ratio. PBS absorption may raise a problem in
the use of nerve conduits if it sufﬁces to distort the tube
lumen space.33 The deformation of nerve guides is believed
to impede the outgrowth of regenerating nerves. As pre-
sented in Figure 2(b), the large absorption occurred within
5 day in PLGA 90/10 and 7 days in PLGA 50/50. The per-
centage of PBS adsorbed by PLGA 90/10 was maintained
at 15% to stabilize the conduit. Meanwhile, PLGA 50/50
had larger PBS sorption capacities than PLGA 90/10. PLGA
degradation products should also be considered in conduit
applications. Degradation products (lactic acid) may ad-
versely inﬂuence axonal growth and nerve function.26 The
results in Figure 2(c) indicated that the pH of the soaking
PBS in PLGA 50/50 markedly decreased in 21 days. In con-
trast, the pH of PLGA 90/10 remained almost constant. Based
on the previous results of degradation, the PLGA 50/50 was
degraded substantially during this period. Therefore, PLGA
50/50 was neglected in subsequently experiments.
The estimated porosities of three types of conduits, that
immersed in 0, 20, and 95% isopropyl alcohol, were (83.5
6 5.3)%, (73.6 6 4.7)%, and (66.1 6 3.4)%, respectively.
The porosity of various asymmetric conduits decreased as
the concentration of isopropyl alcohol increased at 258C.
Figures 3(a–i) present the cross-section and two thin skin
surfaces on both sides of asymmetric ﬁlms. As shown in
Figure 3. SEM micrographs of asymmetric PLGA 90/10 ﬁlms prepared by different concentration
of isopropyl alcohol; (a) cross-section in high-porosity ﬁlm, (b) inner surface in high-porosity ﬁlm, (c)

medium-porosity ﬁlm, (f) outer surface in medium-porosity ﬁlm, (g) cross-section in low-porosity
ﬁlm, (h) inner surface in lowporosity ﬁlm, (i) outer surface in low-porosity ﬁlm.

molecular weight 180–66,200 Da across the asymmetry
ﬁlms was studied and depicted in Figures 4(a–c). The high-
porosity ﬁlms were permeable to such molecules as glucose,
lysozyme and BSA, both in outﬂow and inﬂow directions.
The low-porosity ﬁlms exhibited little outﬂow and inﬂow
in all periods. Notably medium-porosity ﬁlms demonstrated
clear directional selectivity, which differed markedly between
the two ﬂow directions (high outﬂow and low inﬂow).
Interaction Between Schwann Cells and
Fibroblasts in a Coculture System
As an intracellular enzyme, LDH was released only in
cases of cellular injury. The release of LDH into culture
medium is an accurate and sensitive marker of cellular cy-
totoxicity. Therefore, the protective effect of an asymmetric
ﬁlm on cultured cells was determined by measuring the
amount of LDH released in the cultured medium. As
presented in Figure 5(a), the release of the LDH by
Schwann cells into the medium and low-porosity ﬁlms was
signiﬁcantly lower than that into high-porosity ﬁlms in all
periods. Additionally, the releases of LDH of ﬁbroblasts in
high and medium-porosity ﬁlms statistically signiﬁcantly
exceeded that in low-porosity ﬁlms. Notably, these results
are the complete reverse of those for Schwann cells.
The MTT assay is based on the cleavage of the yellow
tetrazolium salt MTT to purple formazan by metabolic
active cells. An increase in the number of living cells
increases the total metabolic activity of the samples. As
shown in Figure 5(b), the Schwann cells in medium and
low-porosity ﬁlms had a markedly higher total MTT reduc-
tion activity than that of low-porosity ﬁlms. Additionally
the increment in the MTT reduction activity of ﬁbroblasts
in high or medium-porosity ﬁlms, was signiﬁcantly lower
than that in low-porosity ﬁlms.
Animal Study
After 6 weeks, animals were sacriﬁced to examine the
morphology of the implanted PLGA 90/10 conduits. The
low-porosity conduits were kept intact. The high and
medium-porosity conduits were partially degraded and
absorbed, while the outer walls were decomposed into frag-
ments; no collapse was noted.

Schwann cells release a variety of neurotrophic factors
that are regarded as axonal growth-promoting factors to
stimulate axonal regeneration during Wallerian degenera-
tion. The Schwann cell membrane serves as a suitable sub-
strate for axonal outgrowth.42,43 Fibroblasts can also affect
myelin removal by producing granulocyte macrophage-
colony stimulating factor.44 The GM-CSF induces macro-
phages and Schwann cells to upregulate their surface
expression if MAC-2 (a galactose-speciﬁc lectin), which is
involved in mediating myelin phagocytosis and activating
macrophages. It was found that the perineurium composed
of ﬁbroblasts bridges the nerve gap, providing a guide for
subsequent cellular elements, such as Schwann cells and
new axons.45 However, too many ﬁbroblasts contribute to
ﬁbrosis of peripheral nerves and scar formation at suture
sites, which have an adverse effect on nerve regeneration.46
Consequently, a low level of ﬁbroblasts and a high level of
Schwann cells may provide a favorable environment for
nerve regeneration.19
Notably, results of the histological examination also
indicated statistically crucial different in relation to inﬂow
capacity. The higher number of thick ﬁbers of medium-
porosity conduits in the regenerated nerves undoubtedly
arose from stronger activity of the inner seeded Schwann
cells and the inhibition of the outer ﬁbroblasts growth,
which led to the earlier recovery of their myelin sheaths. In
fact, these three PLGA 90/10 conduit groups were all fabri-
cated by the similar procedure. The biocompatibility,
porosity and degradation were all similar. Therefore, the
low inﬂow capacity of the medium-porosity asymmetric
conduits is the optimal explanation to the results of the
histological data.
An extensive proliferation of Schwann cells and a limited
number of ﬁbroblasts were considered as an ideal environ-
ment for axonal regeneration. In this study, we demon-
strated that medium-porosity of asymmetric nerve conduits
with high outﬂow and low inﬂow rate could build a favor-
able environment and manipulate cells activities. Therefore,
the ‘‘directional’’ selectivity of asymmetric nerve conduits
hold particular promise for peripheral nerve regeneration.
CONCLUSION
This work demonstrated PLGA 90/10 as an optimal mate-
rial for fabricating nerve conduits in terms of degradation
rate. In MTT and LDH testing, high-outﬂow and low-inﬂow
ﬁlms strongly protected the seeded cells in a coculture sys-
tem. Additionally, directional permeability conduits had
substantially more regenerated A-type and B-type ﬁbers in
repairing a 10 mm rat sciatic nerve defect. In conclusion,
in vitro and in vivo results suggested that directional per-
meability should be considered in designing nerve conduits
for peripheral nerve regeneration.

1. Introduction
Autologous nerve grafts have been commonly used in
bridging peripheral nerve defects [1,2]. However, it has
unavoidable disadvantages, such as the limited avail-
ability and donor-site morbidity of autografts. Allo-
grafts were also used in peripheral nerve reconstruction.
causes another problem. Enormous effort has been
devoted to develop the synthetic nerve conduits for the
repaire of peripheral nerve defects [3–7]. These synthetic
conduits can guide axon migration, maintain regulator
factors from the distal stump for contacting the
regenerated axons, and prevent the wound space from
invasion of exogenous cells and tissues [8].Available online 10 August 2005
Abstract
This study attempted to accelerate the peripheral nerve regeneration, using the high outﬂow rate of asymmetric poly(DL-lactic
acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nerve conduits. Asymmetric PLGA nerve conduits of monomer ratio 85/15 were prepared by
immersion–precipitation method to serve as possible materials. In this study, mandrels were immersed into a 20% (wt/wt) of PLGA/
1,4-dioxane solution and precipitated in a non-solvent bath followed by freeze-drying. Different concentrations of isopropyl alcohol
(95%, 40% and 20%) were used as precipitation baths where non-asymmetric (95%) and asymmetric (40% and 20%) conduits
could easily form. The asymmetric nerve conduits that consisted of macrovoids on the outer layer, and interconnected micropores in
the inner sublayer, possessed characters of larger outﬂow rate than inﬂow rate. The asymmetric conduits were implanted to 10mm
right sciatic nerve defects in rats. Autografts, silicone and non-asymmetric PLGA conduits were performed as the control and the
contrast groups. Implanted graft specimens of all groups were harvested for histological analysis at 4 and 6 weeks following surgery.
The asymmetric PLGA conduits maintained a stable supporting structure and inhibited exogenous cells invasion during entire
regeneration process. Asymmetric PLGA conduits were found to have statistically greater number of regenerated axons at the
midconduit and distal nerve site of implanted grafts, as compared to the silicone and non-asymmetric groups at 4 and 6 weeks. Of
interest was that the results of 4 weeks in asymmetric groups were better than the non-asymmetric groups at 6 weeks in number of
axons. According to the results of permeability, the asymmetric structure in the conduit wall seemed to enhance the removal of the
blockage of the waste drain from the inner inﬂamed wound in the early stage, which may have improved the efﬁcacy of the
peripheral nerve regeneration. The asymmetric structure could be adequately employed in the future as optimal nerve conduits in
peripheral nerve regeneration.

3.1. Conduit fabrication
Highly porous and permeable conduits could be
fabricated by dipping PLGA solution over a mandrel,

omatewas conducted on the rat’s right leg, under aseptic conditions.
After an incision had been made in the skin, the sciatic nerve
was exposed by making a muscle splitting incision. An
operating microscope (Leica Micrisystems, Deerﬁeld, IL) was
used to divide the sciatic nerve near its origin, and a 10mm
nerve segment was excised with microscissors. The reversed
autografts, silicone conduits and PLGA conduits were
interposed into the 10mm nerve defects. The proximal nerve
was anchored in the conduit by 9-0 nylon microsutures. The
distal end was then sutured into the other end of the conduit.
Nerve stumps at both ends were sutured into the conduit to a
length of approximately 1mm. Hence, 10mm of the nerve gap
was left between two stumps. In addition, to ensure no
connecting between the excised nerve segment and the two
stumps during nerve regeneration, autografts were reversely
interposed into the nerve defects to prevent any potential
branching of axons or vessels through the side branches. The
wound was then closed in layers using 4-0 Dexon sutures. The
animals were housed in temperature (22 1C) and humidity
(45%) -controlled rooms with 12 h light cycles; they had access
to food and water ad libitum. All procedures followed animalEighty male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing 250–300 g were
divided into ﬁve groups (Table 1). Group 1 (n ¼ 16) received
10mm reversed autografts into their right sciatic nerves and
served as a control. Groups 2 and 3 (n ¼ 16 each) comprised
12mm silicone conduits (Silastic, RX50, Dow corning;
1.57mm ID, 2.41mm OD) and PLGA-95% non-asymmetric
conduits, respectively. Groups 4 and 5 (n ¼ 16 each) consisted
of 12mm PLGA-40% and PLGA-20% asymmetric conduits.
2.4.2. Surgical procedure2.3. Permeability studies
The permeability of the fabricated ﬁlms was measured using
a 2ml glass tube and a 10ml vial as a diffuse tank. In this
study, the solutes used were glucose (Mw 180Da), lysozyme
(Mw 14,600Da) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Mw
62,000Da). The solutes were dissolved in a 50mM phosphate
buffered solution (pH 7.5). The solute concentrations were
10mM/ml for glucose assay, 100mM/ml for lysozyme and
50mM/ml for BSA. A total of 1ml of solution was added into
the 2ml tube, which was sealed with a 0.785-cm2 diffuse area
of ﬁlm on the top. The sealed tube containing solution was
then immersed in 5ml of PBS in the vial. After 1, 24 and 48 h,
20ml of solution was retrieved from the PBS vial and analyzed
by glucose assay and the Bio-Rad agent for proteins. Solute
concentrations were measured using a UV spectrophotometer
(Hitachi Co., U-2000) at wavelengths of 500 nm for glucose
assay, and 595 nm for lysozyme and BSA. The procedure was
repeated on the reverse side of the fabricated ﬁlms to obtain
the inﬂow and outﬂow rate of diffusion.

C.-J. Chang, S.-h. Hsu / Bicare and use committee of our university guidelines.2.4.3. Histological analysis
Four and six weeks after implantation, all animals were
sacriﬁced by methoxyﬂuorane overdose. The implanted grafts
were harvested and histologically analyzed. The nerve grafts
were immediately ﬁxed in a cold buffered 3% glutaraldehyde
solution. Nerve grafts were then washed in 0.1M phosphate
buffer (Fischer Scientiﬁc, Fair Lawn, NJ) and divided into
three segments to ensure precise localization. The transverse
sections were obtained only at two sites: the start of the distal
stump and the midpoint of the resected gap. These segments
were then postﬁxed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences,
Warrington, PA); dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol
solutions, and ﬁnally embedded in spurs. The embedded nerves
were cut to 5 mm thickness, and then stained with 1% toluidine
blue, which did not stain PLGA.
All nerve sections were observed under a light microscope,
and photographs were taken using a digital camera (COOL-
PIX 995, Nikon Co., Japan). Analyses were conducted using
an image analysis system (Image-Pro Lite, Media Cybernetics,
USA) to determine the number and areas of individual
myelinated axons. Additionally, the cross-sectional area of
the whole nerve section was measured under 40 and 400
magniﬁcation. Three randomly selected ﬁelds with an area of
80 mm 60 mm in each nerve specimen were observed at a
magniﬁcation of 400 , the axons and vessels were counted.
The numbers of axons were extrapolated by applying the area
algorithm to estimate the total number of axons associated
with each nerve. Moreover, the mean area of the axons for
each nerve specimen was also determined. All data were
obtained and expressed as means7standard deviations. The
asymmetric conduits groups (PLGA-40% and PLGA-20%)
were compared with the control group (autografts), silicone
conduits group and the non-asymmetric group (PLGA-95%).
Differences were also compared between the two asymmetric

3.3. Permeability
The inﬂow and outﬂow permeability experiments
were performed to study the inward and outward
diffusion of the conduits in relation to different degrees
of asymmetric structure (PLGA-95%, 40% and 20%).
The permeability of different molecules of carbohy-
drates and proteins ranging from molecular weight
180–66,200Da across the asymmetry ﬁlms was studied
and depicted in Fig. 3a–f. The asymmetric PLGA ﬁlms
were permeable to molecules like glucose, lysozyme and
BSA. For molecules of small size such as glucose,
PLGA-95% groups exhibited the same inﬂow and
outﬂow rate at all time periods; whereas PLGA-40%
and 20% showed signiﬁcantly asymmetric effects
initially, i.e. the outﬂow rate of glucose was larger than
the inﬂow rate, but the two rates became approximately
equal at 48 h. The results of lysozyme and BSA were
similar to those of glucose except that the asymmetric
effects endured for at least 48 h. It was postulated that
the lumen layer was a semi-permeable membrane that
conferred molecular mass selectivity to the conduit wall,
whereas the porous outer wall region controlled the rate
of permeation and acted as a backing support. These
consequences closely agreed with the study of typical
asymmetric membranes [26,27]. It has been reported
that a high permeability accelerated the nerve regenera-
tion [28,29]. The asymmetric conduits with the larger
outﬂow rate thus could have positive effects on
peripheral nerve repair. This was conﬁrmed later in
the in vivo experiments.

Aebischer et al. [30] reported that, when using porous
materials, the pore size determined which molecules
would pass through the graft between the surrounding
tissue and the regenerating nerve. A molecular weight
cutoff of approximately 50,000 has been found suitable
to allow diffusion transport of nutrients and other
molecules while preventing cells from entering the
conduits. However, no researchers of nerve conduits
have focused on the outﬂow and inﬂow rate in the
conduit wall.
Castilho et al. [31] outlined some important features
of proximal stump where early regenerative events
began. Axonal end bulbs result from the enlargement
of the proximal portions of transected axons because of
the accumulation of transported axoplasmic material.
The inﬂamed may occur during the implantation
procedure itself and the immediate period (ﬁrst 1–3
days) after surgery of the nerve conduits into the novel
adult host environment. Therefore, a nerve conduit with
high outﬂow rate to exclude drained waste produced
from the traumatized host nerve stump is necessary. The
asymmetric conduit affords great exclusion ability of the
waste drain in traumatic nerve. This was analogous to
the structure of anisotropic ultraﬁltration conduits used
for separating proteins from cells and small molecules.
In addition, the thicker, macrovoids external layer of theasymmetric conduits also provided desired structural
support which will maintain the contour till the nerve
regeneration is completed.

rials 27 (2006) 1035–1042 1041According to the literatures [17,18], it is known that
the permeability and porosity of PLGA and silicone
conduits may result in great difference in nerve recovery
rate. However, the reasons why the asymmetric conduits
performed much better than non-asymmetric conduits
in early nerve repair period are still unknown. In fact,
these two PLGA conduit groups were all fabricated by
the same procedure in same materials. The biocompat-
ibility, porosity, degradation and mechanical strength
were all similar. Therefore, the geometric conﬁguration
of the asymmetric and non-asymmetric conduits which
causes the large variance in outﬂow and inﬂow rate is
the optimal explanation to the results of the histological
data.
To the best of our knowledge, this study was the ﬁrst
one to demonstrate that asymmetric conduits with a
higher outﬂow capacity were very helpful in the
early recovery period of peripheral nerve regene-
ration. Different extents of asymmetric structure
could easily form by controlling the concentrations of
isopropyl alcohol as precipitation baths. Further-
more, the in vivo results indicated that the concept of
high outﬂow permeability of asymmetric structure
could be further employed in developing novel
nerve conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration rather
than focusing only on the high permeability of the
conduits.
