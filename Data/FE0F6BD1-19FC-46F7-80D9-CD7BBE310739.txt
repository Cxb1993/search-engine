1.  Introduction 
Most researchers (e.g. Naddor [22], Liberatore [18], Magson [20], Kim and Park [12], Silver and Peterson 
[35], Foote et al. [8], Azoury and Brill [1], Chiu [5] and Hariga and Ben-Daya [11]) have used deterministic or 
probabilistic models; the lead time is viewed as a prescribed constant or a stochastic variable, which therefore is 
not subject to control when dealing with inventory problems. However, as pointed out by Tersine [36], lead time 
usually comprises several components, such as setup time, process time, wait time, move time and queue time. 
In many practical situations, lead time can be reduced using an added crash cost; in other words, it is controllable. 
By shortening the lead time, we can lower the safety stock, reduce the stock-out loss, improve the service level 
to the customer so as to increase the competitive edge in business. Firstly, Liao and Shyu [17] presented a prob-
abilistic model in which the order quantity is predetermined and the lead time is a unique decision variable. 
Secondly, Ben-Daya and Raouf [2] have also extended the model of Liao and Shyu [17] by considering both the 
lead time and the order quantity as decision variable where shortage are neglected. Recently, Ouyang et al. [28] 
considered an inventory model with a mixture of backorders and lost sales to generalized Ben-Daya and Raouf’s 
[2] model, where the backorder rate is fixed. 
In this plan, we consider to allow the backorder rate as a control variable. Under most market behaviors, we 
can often observe that many products of famous brands or fashionable commodities may lead to a situation in 
which customers prefer their demands to be backordered while shortages occur. Certainly, if the quantity of 
shortages is accumulated to a degree that exceeds the waiting patience of customers, some may refuse the back-
order case. However, the supplier can offer a price discount on the stock-out item in order to secure more back-
orders. This phenomenon reveals that, as shortages occur, the longer the length of lead time is, the larger the 
amount of shortages is, the smaller the proportion of customers can wait, and hence the smaller the backorder 
rate would be. But, the larger the backorder discount is, the larger the backorder rate would be. Thus, the back-
order rate is dependent on the amount of shortages and backorder price discounts. Therefore, we also consider 
the backorder rate that proposed by combining Ouyang and Chuang [27] (or Lee [14]) with Pan and Hsiao [30] 
to present a new form. In addition, there are many authors (Porteus [31, 32, 33], Billington [3], Nasri et al. [23], 
Kim et al. [13], Paknejad et al. [29], Sarker and Coates [34], Ouyang et al. [25, 26], Moon and Choi [21], 
Chuang et al. [6], Lin and Hou [19] and Chang et al. [4]) have investigated the effects of investing in reducing 
ordering cost. Hence, we treat the ordering cost as a decision variable in this research. 
Since Lee et al. [16] consider that the lead time demand follows a mixture of normal distributions, we relax 
the assumption about the form of the mixture of distribution functions of the lead time demand. Therefore, we 
consider any mixture of distribution functions (d.f.s), say 21* )1 ( FppFF −+= , of the lead time demand has only 
known finite first and second moments (and hence, mean and standard deviation are also known and finite) but 
make no assumption on the distribution form of *F . That is, 1F  and 2F  of *F  belongs to the class Ω of all 
single d.f.s’ with finite mean and standard deviation. Our goal is to solve a mixture inventory model by using the 
minimax criterion. This is, the minimax criterion (such as Wu et al. [37]) for our model is to find the most unfa-
vorable d.f.s 1F  and 2F  in *F  for each decision variable and then to minimize over the decision variables.

In the real market as unsatisfied demands occur, the longer the length of lead time is, the larger the amount 
of shortage is, the smaller the proportion of customers can wait, and hence the smaller the backorder rate would 
be; in addition, the larger backorder price discount is, and hence the larger the backorder rate would be. There-
fore, we also consider the backorder rate that proposed by combining Ouyang and Chuang [27] (or Lee [14]) 
with Pan and Hsiao [30] at the same time. Thus, we define 00 /ππββ x= , where  0 β = +−+ )( 1 rXEε

Besides, we also consider that the ordering cost can be reduced through capital investment and the ordering cost 
A as a decision variable. Hence, we seek to minimize the sum of capital investment cost of reducing ordering 
cost A and the inventory costs (as expressed in (2)) by optimizing over Q, A, xπ and L constrained on 0 < A

Now, we attempt to use a minimax criterion to solve this problem. If we let Ω be the class of all single c.d.f.

to find the most unfavorable c.d.f.s 1F  and 2F  in Ω for each decision variable and then to minimize over the

we need the following proposition.

Further, it is assumed that the allowable stock-out probability q during lead time is given, that is, q =P(X > r),

computer software Compaq Visual Fortran V6.0 (Inclusive of IMSL) [7] and summarized in Table 2. From 
Table 2, we note that (i) the order quantity ∗Q , the ordering cost *A , the backorder price discount ∗xπ  and

when 0 < p < 1, the model considers two kinds of customers’ demand. It implies that EAC( *Q , *A , *xπ , *L ) of

ε = 0, when δ = 1.0; (vii) the cost penalty nCEA ′ / nEAC  of using the distribution free operating policy in-
stead of the optimal one is increasing and then decreasing as ε  increases (i.e. the backorder rate β  de-
creases) for the fixed p except δ = 0.0 and ε = 0, p = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, when δ = 1.0. 
 
4.  Concluding remarks 
In this article, we consider that the backorder rate is dependent on the amount of the shortages and the 
backorder price discount by using the idea of Ouyang and Chuang [27] and Pan and Hsiao [30]. Hence, we re-
gard the backorder rate as controllable variable. In addition, we also treat the ordering cost as a decision variable. 
Moreover, we make no assumption about the form of the mixtures of distribution functions of the lead time de-
mand and apply the minimax criterion to solve the problem. We also develop an algorithmic procedure to find 
the optimal inventory policy. 
In future research on this problem, it would be interesting to deal with the inventory model with a service 
level constraint or treat the reorder point as a decision variable.
