We describe the development of cationically-modified polymeric nanoparticles with a 
core-shell structure, having the potential for use in immunotherapy. The core of 
nanoparticles is used to load fluorescent quantum dots for ultrasensitive detection of 
the migration of Langerhans cells from the skin to lymph nodes, once delivered 
transdermally by a gene gun. A reporter gene is electrostatically adsorbed onto the 
shell layer of nanoparticles, which could subsequently be released intracellularly 
through a pH-mediated mechanism.

PLGA (lactide/glycolide molar ratio of 75:25, inherent viscosity 0.17 dL/g) was obtained from 
BioInvigor (Taipei, Taiwan). PVA (MW = 30,000–70,000 ), GC (MW = 25,000), and 
dichloromethane (DCM) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). CdSe/ZnS 
QDs were purchased from Evident Technologies (Troy, NY, USA). The DNA (pEGFP-N2, 4.7 
kb), containing a CMV promoter and an enhanced green fluorescence protein reporter, used in the 
study was obtained from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA). 
CSNPs/QDs were prepared by an emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method [19]. Briefly, PLGA 
(10 mg/mL) and QDs (1 mg/mL) were dissolved in DCM. The prepared organic solution (4 mL) 
was added into an aqueous solution (8 mL) containing PVA (1.0% w/v) and GC (0.2% w/v) and 
then emulsified with a homogenizer (Polytron PT-1200, Kinematic AG, Littau, Switzerland) for 5 
min and followed by 10 min of sonication (Sonics & Materials, Newtown, CT, USA). The 
mixture was then transferred into 100 mL DI water and allowed to stir overnight at room 
temperature in a fume hood to evaporate the organic solvent. The prepared CSNPs/QDs were 
collected by centrifugation (60 min, 9000 rpm), washed three times with DI water, and then 
rsuspended in DI water. The PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) and the core-shell PLGA nanoparticles 
without incorporation of QDs (CSNPs) were prepared in a similar manner. 
The size distribution and zeta potential of the prepared nanoparticles were measured using DLS 
(Zetasizer, 3000HS, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). A fluorescence 
spectrophotometer (F-2500, Hitachi Instrument, Tokyo, Japan) was used to characterize the
