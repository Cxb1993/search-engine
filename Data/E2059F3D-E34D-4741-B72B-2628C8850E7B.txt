動態階層式 CMA 在時變性傳輸通道的效益評估 
 
    CMA 是盲蔽式等化器演算法，但是有二個缺點，首先，CMA的收斂速度太慢，其次是，CMA可能會
被陷入局部最小點。此問題可能會異常的嚴重，如果傳輸通道的多重路徑延遲分布會隨著時間快速的
改變，如此一來，等化器的長度勢必難以決定，如果等化器的長度遠超過通道的多重路徑延遲分佈，
則收斂速度慢，如果等化器的長度短於通道的多重路徑延遲分佈，則亦有發散的可能。在本研究，我
們提出一個動態階層式演算法，等化器的長度可依據多重路徑延遲分佈而調整，如此一來等化器的長
度略大於延遲分佈，就可避免以上的缺點。我們初步的分析與模擬，我們已發現，此種做法，確實可
改善 CMA 的缺點。 
    本研究的主要貢獻在於提出一個動態調整等化器長度的階層式架構，當延遲分佈大時，等化器長
度切割成比較少的段數，每一區段都大於延遲分佈，反之，當延遲分佈小時，等化器長度切割成比較
多的段數。

Abstract  
The Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) adopts the constant modulus (CM) criterion to minimize the 
deviation of the equalizer output from a fixed value. However it has two drawbacks: (1) slow rate of 
convergence (2) the likelihood of getting trapped in a local minimum. The problem gets even worse when the 
channel delay spread varies rapidly as the filter length cannot match the delay spread. If the filter length is 
significantly longer than the delay spread, the convergence rate can be slow.  In this paper, we improve the 
performance of the standard CMA by using a dynamically partitioned hierarchical structure to organize the 
taps of a filter. The filter length is dynamically partitioned according to the delay spread such that they are 
tightly matched. Preferably, the length of a sub-filter is slightly longer than the delay spread of the channel. 
The performance evaluation is divided into two parts. In Part I, we do simulation runs for both the cost 
functions and cost surfaces comparing the standard CMA, where the filter length is significantly longer than 
the delay spread, and  the dynamically partitioned CMA, where the filter length matches the delay spread. In 
Part II, an analysis is provided to show that the proposed partitioned scheme can speed up the convergence

of hierarchical CMA. A conclusion is given in Section 4.

3. Performance Evaluation 
Both analysis and simulation runs are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the HCMA. In 
subsection 3.1, we provide the cost functions vs. iteration number )(n  for both CMA and HCMA, 
respectively, through simulation runs. We also show the simulation results of CM surfaces for HCMA in 
different stages of the convergence process. In sub-section 3.2, we present a theoretical analysis to prove that 
HCMA converges faster than the CMA and reaches a lower local minimum. 
3. 1 Simulations Runs 
The cost function is plotted as the weight vector converges to a local minimum, and the cost surface is the CM 
cost function versus the weight vector. 
Cost Functions 
The channel impulse response is [0.2, 0.5, 1.0, -0.1]. The equalizer lengths are 4 and 64, respectively. As 
shown in Figures 2 through 7, the hierarchical scheme reduces the cost function minima, and improves the 
convergence rate significantly for both BPSK and QPSK. Even though the initial weight vector may affect the 
curves, but the trends remain the same.  
CM Cost Surfaces 
The cost surface is defined as follows. [5]

For the HCMA, we show the CM surface ),( 212

11 wwJCM , for weight vector of the second level with the 
weight vectors for the first level being initialized. Figures 8 and 9 show the initial view )1( n of the CM 
surface of the HCMA. Figures 10 through 15 show the CM surfaces and contour plots of the HCMA for 
n 100, 300, and 500, respectively. As HCMA iterates )(n  increases, the weight vectors of the first level 
continue to converge to their local minima. At the same time, we observe that the CM surface of HCMA gets 
narrower and the local minimum gets lower. The former indicates that the HCMA converges faster and the 
latter indicates that the cost function of the second-level sub-equalizer is lower for the HCMA due to the 
signal conditioning of the first-level sub-equalizers. For example, the local minima are (0.3757, 0.47642, 
0.37575, 0.47642) for 100n , (0.17431, 0.41464, 0.17431, 0.41464) for 300n , and (0.17413, 0.41446, 
0.17413, 0.41446) for .500n  
3.2 Theoretical Analysis 
The HCMA improves the convergence rate and reaches a better local minimum. We provide the analysis 
separately as follows. 
HCMA converges to a lower local minimum 
The HCMA falls to a better a local minimum than the standard CMA due to the following two reasons. First, 
the HCMA requires all three sub-equalizers simultaneously reach their local minima corresponding to a local 
minimum in the CMA. Second, since the local minima of the HCMA is only a subset of the CMA, the CMA 
may be trapped into a local minimum which does not exist in the HCMA, and thus the HCMA continues to 
 10 
reached their local minima, that is, HCMA has reached the steady state with the weight vector

 212122212121211112211111 wwwwwwww   is also a steady state weight vector of the CMA.

Thus, each local minimum in HCMA is also a local minimum of CMA. To prove the reverse direction, we 
look at the gradient of the cost function. From the point of view of the first level weight vectors, the cost 
function HCMAJ of the HCMA is identical to that of CMA. The local minimum require that 02 * 

proof of lemma 1) 
To complete the proof that the HCMA converges to a better local minimum, we use a probabilistic model to 
prove that the HCMA converges to a lower local minimum. Let )(ip , where ki 1 , denotes the 
probability that the HCMA trapped into i th local minimum, )(isHCMA  with deviation )(iJ HCMA , and )( jq , 
where lj 1 ,  represents the probability that the CMA trapped into the j th local minimum, 
 12 
HCMA converges faster 
To prove that the HCMA converges faster, we provide some intuitions to this phenomenon. One may consider 
the sub-equalizers at the first level of HCMA as conditioning the signals input to the sub-equalizer at the 
second level. Thus, the equalizer of HCMA is equivalent to the sub-equalizer at the second level. If so, the 
HCMA enjoys two advantages over the standard CMA: (1) a shorter equalizer length, N  vs. N . (2) A 
better channel conditioning (by the sub-equalizers at the first level). For the first point, it indicates that the 
HCMA has fewer dimensions for approaching a local minimum. A reduced dimension implies a shorter route 
to the local minimum. For the second point, since the eignvalue spread of a better channel condition is smaller, 
the HCMA exemplifies a faster convergence rate similar to the LMS as demonstrated in [4]. Lemma 2 gives 
the formal proof of the first point.

Since the weight vector of HCMA is N  instead of N , the expected value of m  is smaller than the 
expected value of n . One can expected that   mNIE HCMA   and    nNIE CMA   if we consider that each 
component of the difference weight vector takes a number of iterations to achieve. And, thus 
 14 
The main idea behind the HCMA is to have a main sub-filter to capture most of the main energy of the 
symbol (main delays of the symbol). And the rest of sub-filters are to capture the residuals of the delay spread 
of the symbol. So it is important that the main sub-filter is longer than that of the main delays of the symbol. 
For a time varying channel, the span of main delays of the symbol is also changing rapidly, the main sub-filter 
must react promptly.   A fast detection mechanism is needed to reduce or increase the length of the main 
sub-filter. A binary search scheme can be employed.  If the steady state excess mean square error is 
drastically on the rise, this is normally a sign that the span of the delay spread has increased and the main 
sub-filter is not able to cover the delay spread. If the excess mean square error is on the rise rather smoothly, it 
reflects the fact that the span of the channel spread has reduced and the length of the main sub-filter must be 
reduced.  
 
 
Note that the number of iterations required to converge depends on the channel conditions. For an 
ill-conditioned channel, the iteration number can be significantly large. The relationship between the required 
iteration number and the channel condition is not known at this time. But we do know that the HCMA 
converges faster when the main sub-filter is able to cover the main delays of the channel throughout the 
simulation runs. 
 
The selection of the number of sub-filter at the first level depends on the delay spread. If the span delay spread 
is long, the number of sub-filters is decreased such that the main sub-filter is long enough to cover the delay 
spread of the channel.
