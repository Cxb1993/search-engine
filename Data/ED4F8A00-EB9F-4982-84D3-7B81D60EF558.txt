Abstract 
The preparation and characterization of 
dispersed zero-valent metals supported on 
chitosan resins are presented. Utilizing these 
metal nanoparticles and their aggregates 
appropriately within chitosan beads are 
compatible with many chemical reactions for 
environmental remediation such as 
transformation of halogenated organic 
compounds, chromate and nitrates by 
zero-valent metal. In this study, the polymer 
supported metal nanoparticles was made. Th 
pH stability and reactivity of the material was 
discussed. The changes in the metal activity 
after repeated use were investigated. We hope 
that the metal-chitosan nanocomposites are 
reusable and could be easily reprocessed over 
many cycles of operation. Finally, the 
characteristic of chitosan-supported metal is 
examined by SEM, EDS, ESCA and ICP. 
 
Keywords: chitosan; nanoparticle; stability;

Introduction 
Nanoparticles have been intensively 
investigated because of unique electronic, 
magnetic, optical, and catalytic properties that 
are different from those of the bulk materials. 
It is well-known that the properties of 
materials undergo drastic changes when their 
dimensions are reduced to the nanometer size 
regime [1-4]. Typically, nanoparticles tend to 
aggregate during their synthesis, and the 
stabilizers such as polymers must be used [5]. 
Preparation of new organic/inorganic hybrid 
materials and nanocomposites has been 
extensively studied [6-9]. Generally, metallic 
nanoparticles-polymer nanocomposites could 
be synthesized by means of a two-step 
procedure. First, the metal ions were adsorbed 
on the polymer sorbent. Then the reduction of 
the loaded metal ions by a suitable procedure 
enables the loaded metals to be present on the 
support at the zero-valent oxidation state. 
Recently, chitosan has been used as a support 
for catalysis [10].  
Chitosan is a transformed polysaccharide 
obtained by alkaline deacetylation of natural 
chitin. With the existence of hydroxyl and 
amino groups along the polymer chain, it can 
effectively adsorb metal ions [11-12]. Because 
chitosan is soluble in acid, it makes a 
restriction for the use of such biosorbents in 
its raw form for wastewater treatment. In an 
attempt to improve its material properties used 
as chitosan-supported metal catalyst or 
reductant, acid-resistant chitosan beads were 
successfully prepared using an in-liquid 
curing method by a simple one-step 
coagulation process [13-14]. The ionic 
interactions between the positively charged 
amino groups on chitosan and the negatively 
charged counterion, tripolyphosphate, were 
successfully used to prepare chitosan beads 
through either intermolecular or 
intramolecular linkages of the anionic 
including diffusion and reaction processes 
[17-19]. Fig.2 shows a plot of Q versus t1/2 for 
the experimental results in Fig.1. This plot 
presents a multi-linearity, which indicates that 
two steps occur. Regarding the bulk diffusion, 
it has been demonstrated that it could be 
neglected under stirring. When the pH value 
was higher than 4, the chemical adsorption is 
rapid [14]. For this reason, film diffusion and 
intraparticular diffusion would be the 
rate-limiting step of sorption kinetics. As 
shown in Fig.2, the first, sharper portion is the 
film diffusion step. The second portion is the 
gradual adsorption step, where the 
intraparticular diffusion is rate-controlled. The 
intraparticular diffusion of Cu2+ ions into 
glassy chitosan-TPP beads was slow due to 
lower hydration of the beads. So the 
intraparticular diffusion would be the 
rate-limiting step of sorption kinetics. Surface 
and cross-section of coated samples was 
analyzed by EDS. In addition to the surface, 
the copper was also detected in the 
cross-section of the beads. 
The nanocomposite has been 
characterized using XPS for the determination 
of the oxidation state of copper. XPS 
measurements have shown that copper is 
present on the Cu-chitosan nanocomposite 
under Cu(0) oxidation state (Fig. 3). After 
adsorption of chromium, the oxidation state of 
copper changed from Cu(0) to Cu(II) (Fig. 4). 
The spectra of Cr-laden nanocomposite 
indicated that there were significant 
contributions of the Cr bound on the 
nanocomposite (Fig. 5). Significant bands 
appeared at binding energies of 576-579 eV 
and 586-589 eV; the former corresponds to Cr 
2p3/2 orbitals, the latter to Cr 2p1/2 orbitals. 
The spectra indicated that Cr(VI) was partially 
reduced to Cr(III). Cr(VI) might be reduced to 
Cr(III) which was in the aqueous solution 
under acidic conditions. The mechanisms are 
as follows: 
14H+(aq) + Cr2O72-(aq) + 6 e-(aq) → 2Cr2+(aq) + 7H2O(l)  ξ0 = 1.33 V 
Cu 2+(aq) + 2e- → Cu(s)  ξ0 = 0.4 V 
Fig. 6 shows serious noise peaks in the 
XPS spectrum of the chitosan after adsorption 
of chromium. The batch adsorption run in this 
study showed poor affinity of chitosan beads 
for chromium.  The adsorption experiments 
were performed and showed that chromium 
adsorption was significantly faster and better 
using Cu-chitosan nanocomposite than using 
chitosan (Figs. 7 and 8). The residual 
concentrations of chromium in the solution 
were 2.21 ppm (pH = 2.85) and 2.90 ppm (pH 
= 4.85). The figures also show the 
repeatability in the use of the same 
nanocomposite production. The second 
experiment was performed at the same 
concentration as the first one. It was found 
that the adsorption capacity on nanocomposite 
(second run) is related to the pH value.  
 
Conclusion 
This study has demonstrated that 
Cu-chitosan nanocomposite is efficient in 
removing chromium from aqueous solutions. 
The characterization of the optimum 
nanocomposite has shown that copper is fully 
reduced to Cu(0). The repeatability of the 
material was also tested.
