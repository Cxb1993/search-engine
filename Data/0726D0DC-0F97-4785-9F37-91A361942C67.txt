The effectiveness and efficiency of the 
results are compared with other 
median-based filters. Experimental results 
demonstrate that the proposed filter based 
on the ART-LMS neural network 
outperforms many well-accepted 
conventional filters in terms of both noise 
suppression and detail preservation. 
 
二、ART-LMS 類神經網路： 
2.1 ART-LMS Architecture  
Based on the framework of the CPN, 
we have developed the ART-LMS network 
to design the weight controller of the 
proposed NCWM filter. Figure 1 shows 
the topology of a three-layered ART-LMS 
network. The first layer is for input, the 
second is the competitive layer (ART 
layer), and the third is the layer of output 
nodes (LMS layer). The nodes in each 
layer are as Fig. 1 shows, fully 
interconnected to the nodes in the adjacent 
layer. The cluster layer can determine 
whether a new training pattern should be 
classified into a specific cluster or a new 
node should be automatically generated 
depending on the vigilance parameter. 
This way, unlike what happens with 
conventional unsupervised learning 
algorithms, the appropriate initial weights 
can be automatically obtained. 
The ART-LMS network functions as 
follows. The first layer of nodes is solely 
for input. The second layer is the 
competitive layer, where each node 
competes (winner takes it all) based on the 
given inputs. ART-LMS uses the 
Manhattan distance to calculate the 
similarity between the input and the 
weight vector. Let the input x  to the j -th 
node of the competitive layer be jU ,

3.1 Structure of the NCWM filter 
Let }1,1|),{( 2121 WkHkkkC ≤≤≤≤=  
denote the pixel coordinates of the noisy 
image corrupted by impulse noise, where 
H  and W  are the image height and 
width, respectively. Let )(kx  represent 
the input pixel value of the noisy image at 
location .Ck ∈ At each location ,k  the 
observed filter window }{kw  whose size 
is 12 += nN ( n  is a non-negative integer)

center pixel. The output of the CWM filter 
is }),{()( kwMEDky cc = where MED  
denotes the median operation and odd c  
),,5,3,1( Nc L=  denotes the center weight. 
Now we have 
)},(,),(),(),(,),({}{ 211 kxkxkxckxkxkw Nnnnc LL ++◊=
         (9) 
where ◊  represents the repetition 
operation. That is, the CWM filter outputs 
the median value of those cn +2  pixel 
values. However, the non-adaptive CWM 
filter processes the whole noisy image in a 
uniform way, making room for excessive 
or insufficient smoothing. To fix the 
drawback of lack of flexibility, the center 
weight c  in ],0[ N  is made adjustable 
within the filter window }{kwc  by using 
the proposed ART-LMS network. 
The framework of the proposed NCWM 
filter is illustrated in Fig. 2. It is composed 
of three parts: an observation vector for 
feature extraction, an ART-LMS weight 
controller, and a CWM filter. At first, 
according to the feature extraction result 
for the input vector, the ART-LMS weight 
controller gives the weight c  to the 
CWM filter. To improve the filtering 
performance, the noise filtering procedure 
is progressively applied through several 
iterations.

To decide the adaptive weight c , we offer

dynamically generated the cluster layer 
nodes in the training process. Figure 4 
shows the relationship between MSE 
values and the number of nodes in the 
cluster layer of the ART-LMS network. 
The figure suggests that the maximum 
number of clusters should be set to 55. 
Figure 5 shows the training processes for 
various epoch numbers and their 
corresponding MSE values. As shown in 
Figure 5, the ART-LMS network 
converged after six training epochs.  
Since the NCWM filter adaptively 
selects an optimized weight through the 
learning process to carry out the filtering 
operation for each input pixel, better noise 
attenuation can be expected without 
excessive blurring. Figure 6 shows that 
the NCWM filter obtained stable results 
after the second iteration. Thus, we 
collected the results after two iterations 
for subsequent experiments.   
For comparison, the corrupted test 
images were also filtered using 
conventional as well as recently 
developed filters, including the standard 
median (MED) filter, the center weighted 
median (CWM) with a center weight of 3 , 
the FM filter, the PSM filter, thePFM filter, 
and the ACWM filter. The filters were 
tested in terms of noise removal capability 
and detail preservation. To assess the 
effectiveness of the proposed ART-LMS 
network, the counterpropagation network 
(CPN) was also tested to see how well it 
could help with image restoration. Table 1 
shows the MSE results of removing 
impulse noise at 20%. The performances 
of PFM and ACWM are very similar for 
all images except the Barbara image, and 
they yielded satisfactory results when the 
parameters concerned were properly set. 
The results of CPN seemed to strongly 
depend on the initial weights. In contrast, 
the proposed NCWM filter exhibited 
superior performance for all test images. 
From Table 1, with consistently better 
results over various images, the 
improvement brought by the NCWM filter 
is evident. 
Detail preservation performance of the 
NCWM filter was also compared with 
those of the other filters. The resultant 
MAE values are shown in Table 2. As the 
table shows, the MAE values obtained by 
the NCWM filter gave are much lower 
than those provided by the other filters for 
all test images. That is, the proposed 
NCWM filter achieved significant 
improvement over other techniques. This 
implies that the proposed filter can 
effectively preserve image details. The 
output images for the ‘Lena’ image 
corrupted by 20% noise probability from 
all filters are shown in Figure 7 for visual 
evaluation of the noise removal and detail 
preservation performance. Clearly, the 
MED filter produces marked blurring of 
the image during removal of the impulse 
noise. Although the CWM and FM filters 
preserve more details, removal of impulse 
noise is poor. On the other hand, the PSM, 
PFM and ACWM filters outperforms the 
former two methods, but still exhibits a 
blurring effect and fails to sufficiently 
suppress impulse noise. The NCWM filter 
produces a restored image with better 
subjective visual quality by offering more 
noise suppression and detail preservation. 
 
五、討論與結論： 
In this project, a novel neural network 
for image restoration is proposed, and a 
new filter built on top of the proposed 
ART-LMS network is presented to 
preserve more image details while 
effectively suppressing impulse noise. 
ART-LMS is a self-organizing neural 
network on the basis of adaptive 
resonance theory (ART) and least mean 
square (LMS) algorithm. ART-LMS uses 
the vigilance to dynamically create the 
cluster layer nodes. Thus, LMS algorithm 
is employed to obtain the optimal center 
weight for each cluster independently.

Abstract. In this paper, a novel adaptive filter based on support vector 
machines (SVMs) that preserves image details and effectively suppresses 
impulsive noise is proposed. The filter employs an SVM impulse detector to 
judge whether an input pixel is noisy. If a noisy pixel is detected, a median filter 
is triggered to replace it. Otherwise, it stays unchanged. To improve the quality 
of the restored image, an adaptive LUM filter based on scalar quantization (SQ) 
is activated. The optimal weights of the adaptive LUM filter are obtained using 
the least mean square (LMS) learning algorithm. Experimental results 
demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms other decision-based median 
filters in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation.  
Keywords: support vector machine, least mean square, impulsive noise, image 
restoration. 
1   Introduction 
Impulsive noise is a common type of noise that often corrupts digital images during 
acquisition or transmission processes over open communication channels. Denoising 
is an essential step before image segmentation, edge detection and object recognition 
for image processing [1]. Image restoration is concerned with not only how to 
efficiently remove impulsive noise but also how to preserve image details. The 
median filter is a well-known nonlinear filter. However, while suppressing impulsive 
noise, the median filter sometimes removes fine details. 
In recent years, variants of the median filter such as weight median (WM) filters, 
fuzzy-rule-based filters, and decision-based filters have been developed in an attempt 
to improve the median filter [2-6]. Satisfactory results have been achieved using these 
filters. Nevertheless, many WM filters tend to mistakenly alter noise-free pixels; the 
generalization capability of fuzzy-rule-based filters is poor; and the parameters of 
decision-based filters inflexibly depend on a pre-assumed noise density level. The 
latest advancement is the adaptive two-pass median (ATM) filter based on support 
vector machines (SVMs) by Lin and Yu, called the support vector classifier (SVC) 
based filter [3]. The SVC-based filter can be also regarded as a decision-based filter. It 
first utilizes SVMs to classify the signal as either noise-corrupted or noise-free and 
then applies the noise-free reduction filter to remove the corrupted pixels. However,

corresponding to their block iΩ  can be adjusted in an iterative fashion along with the 
error surface toward the optimal solution. For each input )(kx  associated with block 
iΩ , the value of )(kiβ  is updated iteratively in a gradient way:

physical output )(ky . iη  denotes the learning rate (with constant), )()0( kiβ  
represents the initial weight, and )()( ktiβ  is the weight after the t -th iteration. 
3.4   Adaptive LUM Filtering  
At first, the median filter is activated for noisy pixels. The SVM impulse detector 
might make mistakes, so undetection and misdetection problems might occur with the 
ASVC filter. Undetected noisy pixels may remain in the restored image because the 
SVM impulse detector did not detect them as noisy and misdetected pixels may be 
mistakenly modified although they are noise-free. Therefore, we incorporated 
adaptive LUM filtering in the ASVC filter to reduce the number of undetected and 
misdetected pixels. Since the ASVC filter adaptively selects an optimized weight to 
carry out the filtering operation for each input pixel )(kx  corresponding to its )(kiβ  
of block iΩ , better noise attenuation can be achieved without degrading the quality of 
fine details.

5   Conclusion 
In this paper, a novel decision-based median filter based on SVMs was developed to 
preserve more image details while effectively suppressing impulsive noise. A new 
impulse detector design based on SVMs is a part of the proposed ASVC filter; it is 
responsible for judging whether the input pixel is noisy. In addition, an adaptive LUM 
filter was proposed to efficiently improve the detection error of the SVM impulse 
detector. The excellent generalization capability of SVMs and the optimal weight of 
each block allow the mean square error of the filter output to be minimized. The 
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASVC filter is superior to a 
number of well-accepted decision-based median filters in the literature.
