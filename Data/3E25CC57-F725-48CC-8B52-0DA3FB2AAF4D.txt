Abstract 
The surface effects on polyethylene 
terephthalate with polymeric hard coating 
(PET-HC) substrates treated by different manners 
used as organic solar cells have been investigated 
by measuring the contact angle. It is observed that 
detergent is quite effective in removing organic 
contamination on the flexible PET-HC substrate. 
Using a DC reactively magnetron sputter, indium 
tin oxide (ITO) thin films of 90 nm are grown on 
a substrate treated by detergent. After ITO thin 
films are deposited, various ITO surface 
treatments are made for improving the 
performance of the developed solar cell. The 
organic solar cell with structure Al/P3HT:PCBM/ 
PEDOT: PSS/ ITO/ PET-HC is fabricated. It is 
found that the surface treatments change the 
parameters of the ITO, i.e., work function, carrier 
concentration, transmittance, resistivity, surface 
morphological and significantly influence the 
solar cell performance. With the optimal 
conditions for detergent treatment on flexible 
PET-HC substrates, we can obtain the ITO film 
with a resistivity of 5.6×10-4 Ω-cm and average 
optical transmittance of 84.1% in the visible 
region. Then, the optimal ITO surface treated by 
3 
P3HT:PCBM/ PEDOT:PSS/ ITO/ PET. Then, we 
characterize the photovoltaic (PV) effects on the 
developed organic solar cell as described in our 
previous work [30]. In the meantime, we mainly 
investigated how the ITO surface treatments 
influence the performance of the developed 
organic solar cell. [31, 32] It is found that the ITO 
surface treatment obviously affects the 
short-circuit current density (Jsc) in organic solar 
cells and that there is no relationship between 
open-circuit voltage (Voc) and ITO surface 
treatments. In this research, we will investigate 
electrical, optical, structural, mechanical, and the 
surface properties of ITO grown on a flexible 
PET-HC substrate using a simple spin-coating 
system for organic solar cells. Accordingly, the 
optimal promising results can be taken from an 
efficient PV which can constitute every type of 
plastic optoelectronic devices and related 
products. 
Experiments: 
The flexible PET substrate used in this work is 
purchased from Kimoto Corp. The flexible 
substrates used in this series of experiments were 
PET with a polymeric hard coating (Kimoto Tech, 
Inc., denoted PET-HC), which surface was 
developed to ensure that repetition use does not 
produce surface scarring. Its thickness is 125 μm, 
and the transmittance is 91% throughout the 
visible spectrum. The flexible PET-HC substrates 
were cut into approximately 5×5 cm2 size pieces. 
Plastic substrates taken from the manufacturer 
have no other pretreatment. Different cleaning 
processes are used to remove the contaminations 
on the flexible PET-HC substrate surface. In this 
research, the flexible PET-HC substrates were 
cleaned by detergent, and UV ozone. In order to 
research the effect of surface wetting properties 
of PET-HC on the device performance, each 
sample contact angle was measured for the 
inspection of its surface cleanliness. 
After cleaning and mounting we used the DC 
magnetron sputter to deposit ITO on a flexible 
PET-HC substrate at room temperature. The ITO 
target includes In2O3 and SnO at a weight 
proportion of 9:1 and the target were placed at a 
distance of 60mm from a flexible PET-HC 
substrate. The sputtering power input to the target 
was adjusted to 50W. The total working pressure 
of 4×10-6 torr consisted of a gas mixture of argon 
(Ar) and oxygen, which was maintained at a fixed 
oxygen (O2) flow rate of 1 sccm. The Ar flow rate 
was adjusted in the range of 20-60 sccm during 
different treatment substrate film growth. All 
films with a thickness of around m were grown at 
room temperature. 
For the comparison of different ITO surface 
treatments, the substrates treated with different 
manners were placed on the sample holder and all 
the devices were fabricated during the same 
deposition process. The X-ray diffraction (XRD, 
Siemens D5000 with Cu Ka radiation) is adjusted 
to the 2θ mode and scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM, Hitachi Field-Emission S-4800) is used to 
characterize the crystal structure. Transmittance 
and reflectance of the ITO layers was measured 
with a Shimadzu MPC-3100 UV/VIS/NIR 
spectrometer in a wavelength range from 400 to 
700 nm. The work function and the visible light 
transmittance of the deposited ITO films were 
measured using a photoelectron spectrometer 
(Riken-Keiki, AC-2) and spectrophotometer 
(Hitachi, U4001). The sheet resistance of the 
sample was measured with a four-point probe 
(Veeco, FPP-50000), and the resistivity of the 
film was calculated. Carrier concentration and 
mobility were obtained from Hall-effect 
measurement (Keithley 2420) at room 
temperature. 
The schematic device structures for proposed 
solar cell structure were illustrated in Fig. 1. The 
proposed structure consists of P3HT:PCBM/ 
PEDOT:PSS layers that were inserted between 
the cathode Al and the anode ITO/PET-HC 
substrate. The procedure of fabricating the solar 
cell was described as follows: The substrate was 
cleaned by detergent, and ITO surface was 
treated by different manners. After substrate was 
cleaned, buffer layer (PEDOT:PSS) in the solar 
cell structure was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s 
on the ITO surface. The thickness of the dried 
PEDOT:PSS layer is about 40 nm. After the 
buffer layer formed, the device was transferred 
into a nitrogen filled glove box for coating 
photoactive layer. The photoactive layer was a 
mixed solution of P3HT and PCBM. The P3HT 
and PCBM were dissolved in 1,2- 
dichlorobenzene (DCB) in the concentration of 
16 mg/ml separately. The solution for 
photoactive layer was achieved by mixing P3HT 
and PCBM solution by 1:1 ratio and then heated 
to 80℃ for 1 hr. The photoactive layer was spin 
coated on the buffer layer at 600 rpm for 60 s and 
naturally dried in the glove box. The thickness of 
the photoactive layer is about 150 nm. Al cathode 
was deposited by evaporation through a shadow 
mask to the thickness of 100 nm. Organic solar 
cells have been prepared using the approved layer 
setup Al/P3HT:PCBM/ PEDOT:PSS/ ITO/ 
PET-HC. For simplification of terrestrial 
solar-cell characterization, the induced current 
density-voltage (J-V) curves of the developed 
devices were measured under the air mass 
5 
Compared with the untreated image in Fig.6(a), 
the morphology of the ITO film (as shown in 
Fig.6(b)) deposited on the 5-min detergent 
treatment substrate does not vary significantly, 
thus dispersing the surface spherical particles and 
showing the flat surface with low roughness. In 
which, there is no defect such as pinholes, cracks 
on the ITO films treated by detergent treatment. 
Moreover, Fig.6(c) with 5-min UV ozone 
treatment illustrates flat with no pinhole. Fig. 6(d) 
shows high-resolution cross-sectional SEM 
images of an 89-nm ITO film. Its substrate is 
treated by detergent manner. No defects are 
found on the coatings, and the surface is smooth 
on this length scale. From figures of 2, 5 and 6 
discussed above, the optimal surface condition is 
5-min detergent treatment on a flexible PET-HC 
substrate. For the as-deposited ITO film on the 
treated substrate, it is confirmed that we need to 
make surface treatment, thus determining the 
optimum process parameters for solar-cell 
applications.  
We use photoelectron spectrometer to analyze 
WF properties of the ITO surface treated by 
different manners. Fig.7 shows the variation of 
WF with different treatment as a function of the 
surface treatment time. In which, we obtain the 
highest WF values are 4.96 eV and 5.15 eV, 
separately treated by 5-min detergent and 20-min 
UV ozone methods. However, we define the step 
of 5-min detergent plus 20-min UV-ozone (D&U) 
treatment (as shown in Fig.7). Obviously, we can 
obtain the optimal WF value is 5.22 eV by D&U 
treatment, which improves about 8.30% in the 
WF compared with that of the untreated (4.82 eV, 
as-deposited) ITO film. The insert SEM images 
illustrate extreme conditions of 7-min detergent 
and 25-min UV ozone treatment, thus 
respectively deteriorating with flakes peeled (left 
photo) and pinholes punched (right photo) on the 
ITO surface. This clearly implies that the increase 
of WF relates to the oxidative degree (created 
during the UV-irradiation) on the ITO surface. 
The phenomenon is consistent with most of 
defect states created just below the edge of the 
conduction band pushing the Fermi level to lower 
values. However, comparing these data with ITO 
film deposited on substrate treated by detergent, 
we can conclude that the surface of the ITO films 
treated by D&U is best by the surface features of 
the solar cells. Finally, we believe that D&U is a 
simple, attractive, and promising technique for 
the production of ITO thin films on the substrates 
treated by detergent. 
Fig. 8 shows the current density-voltage (J-V) 
characteristics of the Al/ P3HT:PCBM/ 
PEDOT:PSS/ITO/ PET-HC device under 
AM1.5G illumination with intensity of 
100mW/cm2 at room temperature. All organic 
solar cells on the substrate treated by detergent 
shows comparable results, which indicate the 
good quality of the photoactive layer on the 
treated surface. Detailed characteristics of solar 
cells such as Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) and 
efficiency values are also given in the inset table, 
respectively. We can observe that the JSC of ITO 
surfaces treated by detergent, UV-ozone, and 
D&U are 6.7 mA/cm2, 8.48 mA/cm2, 8.77 
mA/cm2, respectively. The Jsc for ITO surface 
with D&U treatment increases from 6.42 to 8.77 
mA/cm2, which is 36.6% enhancement as 
compared to the untreated organic solar cell. The 
reason may be differences in the PEDOT:PSS 
layer or higher shunts caused by the influence of 
film preparation conditions. Nevertheless, the 
discrepancy in Jsc of the direct comparable 
(untreated) cells should be a consequence of 
differences in film morphology resulting from the 
ever individual preparation procedure. As can be 
seen in inset table, we find Voc slightly changes 
because of different treating methods. It is found 
that the Voc of the organic solar cell correlates 
directly with the acceptor strength, i.e. it is 
determined by the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of 
donor and acceptor, respectively [37-40]. As a 
consequence, the conversion efficiency for ITO 
surface treated by D&U (2.12%) is higher than 
ITO surfaces treated by detergent (1.42%) and 
UV-ozone (1.91%). Moreover, the efficiency 
increased from 1.1% to 2.12%, which is 92.7% 
enhancement as compared to the untreated 
organic solar cell. The larger enhancement for 
conversion efficiency as compared to Jsc is due 
to the increase of the FF. The short circuit current 
is the parameter showing the highest dependency 
on the ITO surface treatments. Compared with 
the untreated solar cell, Jsc under all three 
treatments is higher. It could be that the carrier 
collection efficiency and Jsc are influenced by 
the concentration of traps and defects on the ITO 
surface having connection with the surface 
treatments. [41]

known method for assessing the cleanliness of the 
substrates. The ITO films are deposited at room

ceramic target of a 90% In – 10% Sn alloy. It is 
found that optical properties of the ITO
