ABSTRACT 
Recently, the medical home has been promoted by many experts as a model for delivering 
comprehensive, coordinated, patient-centered health care. The ageing society and low birth 
rate for most developed countries faces a coming future in which populations both live longer 
and expect to live better. Although healthcare is funded, an increasing proportion of GDP is 
absorbed by escalating healthcare costs. Especially in Taiwan, the cost issues were further 
aggravated by a change in the type of disease. Therefore, to provide more immediate and 
more efficient cares to the patients with cardiovascular and brain vascular disease for drug 
compliance, this study aims antiepileptic drugs with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g. with 
little difference between lethal and therapeutic doses): Phenytoin and Valproic acid. Through 
the bottom-up technology in chemical surface treatment, biomolecular functionality and the 
top-down microfabrication on devices, the biofilm-induced nanomechanics establishes a 
platform in real-time and quantitative analysis which facilitates the point of care for fast 
detection and therapeutics effectiveness monitoring that conventionally the therapeutic drug 
monitoring (TDM) protocols cannot achieve. Thus, this critical information could provide 
doctors about patients dosage adjusted according to measurements of the actual blood levels 
achieved in the person taking it. 
On the advance technology parts, we focus to develop a portable, miniaturized CMOS 
-compatible Enzyme-based bioassay using microcantilever (MCL) where allows 
system-on-a-chip (SoC) embedded. Two novel technique will use. One is the the single 
free-standing microcantilever beam with self -thermal elimination that will reduce all 
non-ideal effects caused by real-time temperature change of environment as well as the 
unwanted chemical effects. The other is using the multiarray package and switch readout 
configuration to enhance the signal-to-noise ration. Practically, designing and implementing 
the system will use a standard CMOS MEMS process to construct a a flexible, efficient, and 
integrated design environment to speed up the design flow, reduce research cost and improve 
the product reliability.We believe the technology holds the promise of better quality of life 
through improved condition management with fewer emergency admissions, and dramatically 
lower care cost per patient.

如上圖二為 Plenary Talk Prof. Christian Amatore 的演講，解說細胞吞噬的五
個階段，由於細胞的尺寸大小，約幾微米至幾十微米，一般是透過顯微鏡的觀測，
但是，其物理極限僅觀察尺寸至微米等級，其中此細胞吞噬的細胞生理生化現象，
不易觀察，因此，利用螢光全反射技術，其螢光激發的範圍僅 3-500 奈米左右，
適合觀測細胞表面的動態觀察。 
 
 
如上圖三為 Plenary Talk Prof. Christian Amatore 的演講，現場的場景，今年
參與 2012 Biosensors 的參與者，比兩年前的參與人數更多。主要是生醫的需求
正逐漸增強，再者，微奈米科技的推動，使得生醫奈米領域，在生物醫學與科技
兩者不同領域的交會，產生了學術、科學與技術的相互衝擊與火花的產生。
