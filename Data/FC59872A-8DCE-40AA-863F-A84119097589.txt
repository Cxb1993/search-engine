Abstract—The distinct property of Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) is the ability to easily and silently track. 
This property is the basis on which many applications using 
RFID are developed. However, with the silent tracking ability 
comes the privacy problem. Recently, a RFID-enabled warranty 
service information system (RWSIS) was proposed to provide 
warranty service for both consumers and companies, and to 
simultaneously avoid unauthorized tracking. RWSIS uses two 
tags on the product and the warranty card and still allows the 
illegal tracking of warranty tag (the tag stuck on the warranty 
card). It is very unlikely that the consumer will carry product 
together with warranty card together unless it is for repairs, and  
one may use an on/off switch or non-removable shielding device 
on the warranty tag to avoid tracking. In this paper, we adopt the 
two-dimensional (2D) barcode instead of warranty tag to solve 
the privacy tracking issue. An attacker needs physical access to 
read the 2D barcode on the warranty card, and thus wireless 
scanning from unauthorized readers is moot. Also, the 2D 
barcode can carry information in addition to storing the required 
security parameters, reader identifiers and random numbers, 
which are also utilized by our proposed RWSIS.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
A radio frequency identification (RFID) system consists of a 
radio tag, reader and backend database system. Readers 
communicate with tags at distance through wireless 
transmission. The reader interfaces with the backend system to 
identify the radio tag. There are two types of RFID tags: 
passive and active. In this paper, our scheme uses passive tags 
which have no battery and are powered by readers. These tags 
only provide limited computation and storage and are nominal 
in cost. The RFID tag plays the role of a wireless barcode. 
Generally, we affix tags to products, animals or other objects. 
Many manufacturers see benefits in applications of RFID 
technology. For example, Wal-Mart recently deployed RFID 
for inventory control and supply chain management, and this 
is definitely the most powerful impetus to RFID development. 
Also, some efficient RFID enabled supply-chain management, 
e.g., inventory control and manufacturing, were introduced in 
[1-3] to speed up the efficiencies. Recently, the Computer 
Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is working with 
manufacturers to use RFID to provide warranty verification 
and returns [4]. A tag on a product can be scanned when 
consumers return products for repairs. They scan the RFID tag 
to obtain the metadata in product tag (such as the date and 
time you purchased the product, the warranty period, and 
repair records). Repair centers then verify the validity of 
warranty period and check the product information on 
company databases to decide whether provide services or not. 
Even if the consumer does not bring the warranty card with 
the product, they can obtain warranty service without hard-
copy warranty receipts. This RFID enabled approach reduces 
waiting time and provides efficient warranty services without 
hassle. Not only for simplifying returns, it can also provide a 
wealth of product information and make the repair process 
more effective. It can help companies and consumers save 
both time and money. Also, this RFID-based approach makes 
product lifecycle management possible. 
The distinct property of RFID is the ability to silently track, 
but with the silent tracking ability usually comes the privacy 
issue. Therefore, both security and privacy are important in 
RFID systems [5]. A RFID tag can be tracked whether the 
traffic between the tag and the reader is encrypted or not, so 
location privacy may be violated. Information of the 
movement and current locations of products are sensitive and 
should be kept private. Applying RFID is bright once the 
privacy concerns are sorted out. Some methods to deter 
tracking were proposed in [6-9]. For example, in [6, 7], the 
authors used the randomized hash-locking approach which 
allows the tag to respond randomized data every time. But in 
this case, the store database needs an exhaustive search to find 
the corresponding product ID. Another solution is to pre-store 
multiple authenticators in the tag [8, 9]. The powered tag 
responds with a different authenticator every time, and the 
authenticator will be renewed when the tag is scanned by an 
authorized reader. These schemes can be compromised when 
the authenticators are exhausted. 
All approaches in [6-9] used a single tag on an object. In 
[10], a RFID-enabled Warranty Service Information System 
(RWSIS) using two tags (the product tag: the tag on product; 
and the warranty tag: the tag stuck on warranty card) was 
proposed to achieve warranty service, and simultaneously 
avoid tracking. This RWSIS requires less expensive RFID tags 
than the Electronic Product Code (EPC) Gen 2 tags currently

ci=1 PRN is the first segment, and when ci=2 is the 
second segment, …, etc. 
A. Product Tag and Warranty Barcode 
Contents of the product tag and the warranty barcode are 
shown in Figure 1. The example is a standard EPC tag having a 
Class ID which consists of fields: header, domain manager, 
object class and Unique ID which is, a serial number (see 
Figure 1(a)). Header defines the length of code, type of 
identifier and the structure of coding. Domain manager is the 
company identifier. Object class gives the type and 
classification of objects. Serial number is a unique identifier for 
the tag. In addition to the Class ID and Unique ID, we need 
extra memory in the product tag to store warranty service 
information and security parameters. This extra memory is 
keyed-writable and tamper-resistant. As shown in Figure 1(a), 
security parameter ki and counter value ci are stored in the 
memory cell; also, the warranty information (the reader 
identifier RID, the product identifier IDi=(Class ID||UIDi), the 
purchased date of product and the warranty period) is 
encrypted with the key h(KR, RAN) and then stored in memory. 
The security parameter ki, the reader identifier RID and the 
random number RAN are encoded by 2D barcode and printed 
on the warranty card (see Figure 1(b)). Since 2D barcode can 
only be read by physical contact, a consumer can verify 
whether the reader is legal by SiB. Notice that the information 
{ki, RID, RAN} is not necessarily encrypted because the 
attacker needs physical contact to read the information. The 
reason we use 2D barcode rather than 1D bar code in our 
RWSIS is not only the higher capacity but also the high 
robustness against error. 
Figure 1.  Product tag and warrant bar code for our RWSIS. 
B. The Proposed Scheme 
In the proposed RWSIS, the EPC in product tag can be 
used for easy management in the supply chain, similar to the 
current use of RFID tags. When the product is sold, contents 
in the extra memory and 2D barcode provide warranty 
services to reduce waiting times and improve consumer 
service, and simultaneously protect against tracking. The text 
description can also be printed on warranty card in case of 
worn bar codes. 
There are four entities in the proposed RWSIS: the 
product tag, the warranty barcode, the reader in shop, and the 
backend database (company database). A secure VPN 
network, e.g., EPC network in [14, 15], should be established 
between all readers and the backend database. An authorized 
reader needs authority to login the backend database.  Also, 
our RWSIS includes four phases: (1) the initial phase (2) the 
product-purchase phase (3) the warranty-service phase (4) the 
information-update phase. To deal with security issues, the 
authors in [5, 8, 9] add extra memory to low-cost RFIDs to 
store some secret parameters, and assume that the EPC code of 
a powered tag cannot be read out without successful 
authentication. The proposed RWSIS is also based on this 
same assumption. In the warranty-service phase, a powered 
tag responds the encrypted metadata after the successful 
authentication. However, the EPC code can only be read out in 
the initial phase for management when the tag is scanned.  
In the product-purchase phase, the customer buys the 
product and receives a warranty card, which the reader writes 
security parameters and encrypted information into the 
product tag, and also prints the 2D barcode containing the 
security parameters, the reader identifier, and a random 
number, on warranty card. In the warranty-service phase, 
consumers return defective products together with the 
warranty card for services, repairs or replacement. Afterwards, 
the reader renews the data in product tag and warranty 
barcode. The operational procedures for the proposed RWSIS 
are described step by step as follows. 
 
(1) Initial Phase: 
Before purchasing, the extra memory cell is cleared. Tags 
attached to the products (goods or materials) operate as a 
standard EPC tag. When the RFID reader scans tags, the 
powered tags on goods or materials will respond with the EPC 
codes containing unique identifiers for goods or materials to 
make internal management more efficient in the supply chain.  
 
(2) Product-Purchase Phase: 
(2-1) Reader in shop: 
The authorized reader in the shop randomly chooses a number 
RAN, and then sends the RAN, the product tag identifier 
IDi=(Class ID||UIDi) and its reader identifier (RID) to the 
backend database. 
(2-2) Backend database: 
The backend database uses the RID to find its corresponding 
KR. Then use the hash function to create the key K=h(KR, 
RAN) used in encryption EK(⋅). Encrypt RID, IDi and warranty 
service information (e.g., purchase date, warranty, period, …). 
Afterwards, send back EK(RID||IDi||Purchase-Date||Warranty) 
to the reader. 
(2-3) Reader in shop: 
Randomly choose security parameter ki, and set the counter 
value ci=1. Then, the authorized reader in shop writes {ki, ci, 
EK(RID||IDi||Purchase-Date||Warranty)} into extra memory in 
the product tag. Simultaneously, encode {ki, RID, RAN} by 2D 
barcode and print it on the warranty card. To avoid the 
will respond ci when it is scanned, the attacker cannot 
determine PRNG(ki) to make the correct response. 
 
(4) Tag-Capture attack: 
Suppose the product tag is lost. Because the extra memory cell 
in tag is keyed-writable, the unauthorized reader cannot 
tamper with the content {ki, ci, EK(RID||IDi||Purchase-Date|| 
Warranty)} in memory. We assume one cannot retrieve the 
information physically in the product tag because the tags are 
tamper-resistant.  
 
(5) Barcode-Capture attack: 
Suppose the warranty barcode is lost. Although an attacker can 
extract {ki, RID, RAN} from the 2D barcode, he does not know 
which product uses this ki. So he cannot craft a correct response 
when receiving a ci from the product. Therefore he could not 
use this ki to track products. Also, the attacker does not have 
the authority to login to the backend database, and thus he 
cannot use {RID, RAN} to gain any information from the 
backend database.

Both schemes provide fast and efficient warranty services. 
In the proposed RWSIS, we use a 2D barcode on warranty card 
to establish a physical contact channel to enhance the privacy. 
However, the consumer cannot carry a product together with 
the warranty card together in [10] because the scheme can be 
compromised by the warranty-tag-only attack. Our RWSIS can 
resist the product-with-warranty-card attack. Therefore, 
considering the consumer’s convenience we may print the 
barcode on product itself and dispense with the warranty 
document. An attacker still needs physical contact of the 
product to obtain ki for a correct response, and thus the privacy 
is still assured. The repair store can provide warranty services 
without hard-copy warranty receipts. 
V. CONCLUSION 
By using warranty barcode, we solve the warranty-tag-only 
attack in [10]. In the proposed RWSIS, an attacker needs 
physical contact with warranty card to achieve successful 
verification from the product tag. It is impossible to scan the 
warranty card without causing suspicion. By SiB, a consumer 
can verify the reader personally to avoid the malicious 
scanning. A RFID tag stuck on the product in our RWSIS still 
performs its role faithfully to provide efficient warranty 
services without a hassle.

Suppose the serial number and the denomination of a 
banknote are S and den. Notations B, L, and M are the 
central bank, the LEA and the merchant, respectively. Juels-
Pappu RBPS includes the following operation procedures, 
creation, verification, anonymization and tracking, which 
are described step by step. 
 
Banknote Creation: (B creates banknotes) 
(1) B uses a secret key to sign the serial number and the 
denomination (Si||deni), and prints Si and the signature 
Σi= ( , )B i iSign SK S den&  on a banknote where || is the 
concatenation of two bit strings. 
(2) B selects a random number r and stores in the δ-cell. 
(3) B encrypts the ( ),i iS r∑ &  by using PKL, and stores Ci= 
( , , )L i iEnc PK S r∑ &  in the γ-cell. 
(4) B computes the key Di=h(Σi) for a banknote. 
(5) B sets the reading/writing capabilities of memory cells 
as follows: the γ-cell is universally-readable and keyed-
writable with an access-key Di; the δ-cell is keyed-
readable/keyed-writable with an access-key Di. 
 
Banknote Verification: (M verifies banknotes while 
receiving from a consumer) 
(1) M scans the optical region and obtains Si and Σi, and 
then computes an access-key Di=h(Σi), where h(⋅) is a public 
hash function. 
(2) M reads Ci from the γ-cell and keyed-reads r from the δ-
cell. 
(3) M verifies ? ( , , )i L iiC Enc PK S r∑= & . 
 
Banknote Anonymization: (M re-encrypts the ciphertext 
after verification) 
(1) M randomly chooses r′  and keyed-writes it into the δ-
cell. 
(2) M computes ( , , )Li i iC Enc PK S r′= ∑ &  and keyed-
writes it into the γ-cell. 
 
Banknote Tracking: (L tracks a banknote without the 
optical contact) 
(1) L reads Ci from the γ-cell. 
(2) L decrypts the Ci by ( , )L iDec SK C  to get ( )i iS∑ & , 
where Dec(⋅) is the inverse function of Enc(⋅). 
(3) L verifies a signature ( ) ? ( , )i B iiS den Veri PK ∑=& , where 
Veri(⋅) is the inverse function of Sign(⋅); obtains the serial 
number Si for tracking. 
 
If one of these steps in banknote verification and banknote 
anonymization fails then a merchant should warn LEA. 
Some attacks- the data recovery, the access-key tracking, 
the cookies threat, the denial of service attack and the 
ciphertext tracking- on the Juels-Pappu RBPS were shown 
in [7]. These attacks compromised the privacy by tracking 
the banknotes’ bearers without the optical contact.  
Other two minor attacks in [7] are the pickpocketing 
attack and making the banknote sleeping and dead. These 
two attacks are caused by the native property of a RFID tag 
but not the RBPS itself, and usually are overcome by a 
hardware solution. For example, the pickpocketing attack 
can be solved by using electromagnetic waves to interfere 
and prevent the intended scanning, or putting money into a 
pocket with a shielding device [9]. Therefore, in this paper, 
these two minor attacks are not discussed in our new RBPS. 
III. THE PROPOSED RBPS 
There are two access-keys DM= ( )h ∑  and DL in our 
RBPS. An access-key DM (same to an access-key D) in the 
Juels-Pappu RBPS, is used for a merchant, while a key DL is 
a global key for LEA. A central bank can create different DL 
for the different banknotes and deliver this global key to 
LEAs with the authority to track the notes through EPC 
network [11, 12]. If the central bank distributes the DL to 
every LEA, the banknotes can be tracked by any LEA like 
the Juels-Pappu RBPS. 
A. Approach 1: Using Two Extra Memory Cells 
The optical and RFID data of Approach 1 are illustrated 
in Figure 2. Two extra memory cells, the β-cell and the ε-
cell, are added. The β-cell is un-readable and keyed-writable 
with a key DM. The ε-cell is un-writable and keyed-readable 
with a key DM (or DL). The γ-cell in the Juels-Pappu RBPS 
is modified from “universally-readable/keyed-writable” to 
“universally-readable/un-writable”. The δ-cell and the 
optical data are same to the Juels-Pappu RBPS. Moreover, a 
command “(β)⊕(ε)→(γ)” is performed by a tag itself after 
that the β-cell is keyed-written, where a command 
“(β)⊕(ε)→(γ)” denotes XOR-ing the values of the β-cell and 
ε-cell and storing into the γ-cell. Two commands “R(ε)→(ε); 
(β)⊕(ε)→(γ)” are performed by a tag after that the γ-cell is 
queried, where “R(ε)→(ε)” denotes randomizing the value 
of the ε-cell. 
The above functions of memory cells are actually 
workable for RFID tags, and can be implemented by the 
current technology. The rationale is described as the 
following. About the reading/writing capabilities of memory 
cells, they are also used in [6]. Considering the command 
operation of RFID tag when the memory cell is queried, it 
can be done by preciously intelligent chip design according 
the state flow chart. For example, in [13], a tag is designed 
with many mutually exclusive states, e.g., dormant state, 
calibration state, and global command start state for 
performing the proper commands. For generating the 
random number in RFID tag, it is acceptable to store a 
randomly generated 80-bit number in a storage cell (see 
[13]). 
The operation procedures of Approach 1 are described as 
follows. In these operations, we use a term “store” to denote 
that a central bank and a tag put the data in memory cells.

we only add one extra memory cell, the ε-cell, which is 
same as Approach 1. Other two memory cells, the γ-cell and 
the δ-cell, and the optical data are same to the Juels-Pappu 
RBPS. Moreover, three commands “(γ)⊕(ε)→(γ); R(ε)→(ε); 
(γ)⊕(ε)→(γ)” are performed by a tag when the γ-cell is 
queried. Also, a command “(γ)⊕(ε)→(γ)” is performed by 
the tag after that the γ-cell is keyed-written. The optical and 
RFID data of Approach 2 are illustrated in Figure 3.

According to a new tag, the following steps in Approach 
1 should be modified: (C-3) and (C-5) in Banknote 
Creation, (V-5) in Banknote Verification, (A-2) and (A-3) in 
Banknote Anonymization, (T-6) in Banknote Tracking. 
 
Banknote Creation: 
( C -3′ ) B computes 1 2( , , )i L i iC Enc PK S r r= ∑ ⊕&  and 
stores in the γ-cell. 
( C -5′ ) B sets the reading/writing capabilities of memory 
cells as follows: the γ-cell is universally-readable and 
keyed-writable with a key DM; the δ-cell is keyed-
readable/keyed-writable with a key DM; the ε-cell is keyed-
readable with a key DM (or DL) and un-writable. 
 
Banknote Verification: 
( V -5′ ) After reading the γ-cell, the following three 
commands will start by a tag: (γ)⊕(ε)→(γ); R(ε)→(ε); 
(γ)⊕(ε)→(γ). The operation is described as follows: a tag 
firstly XORs the random number r2 with the value of γ-cell 
and stores the result 1( , , )L i iEnc PK S r∑ &  into the γ-cell. 
Then, randomizes the r2 in the ε-cell to 2r′ , and do the 
command (γ)⊕(ε)→(γ) again. Finally, the γ-cell has 
( 1( , , )L i iEnc PK S r∑ &  ⊕ 2r′ ). 
 
Banknote Anonymization: 
( A -2′ ) M computes 1( , ,  )i L i iC Enc PK S r′= ∑ &  and keyed-
writes it into the γ-cell. 
( A -3′ ) After writing the γ-cell, a command (γ)⊕(ε)→(γ) is 
started by a tag, i.e., the value of ε-cell ( 2r′ ) is XOR-ed with 
the value of γ-cell and stored back into the γ-cell. Finally, 
the γ-cell has 1 2( , ,  )  L i iEnc PK S r r′ ′∑ ⊕& . 
 
Banknote Tracking: 
( T -6′ ) After reading the γ-cell, a command (γ)⊕(ε)→(γ) is 
started by a tag. As the step ( V -5′ ), the ciphertext will be 
changed, and this is why our Approach 2 can avoid the 
ciphertext tracking. 
 
If one of these steps ( V -1′ )~( V -5′ ), and ( A -1′ )~ ( A -3′ ) 
fails then a merchant should warn LEAs. The new approach 
trades one more command (γ)⊕(ε)→(γ) in ( V -5′ ) for saving 
one memory cell. The more memory cells increase a tag’s 
size, and is not suited to attach on a note. 
IV. SECURITY ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON 
A. Security Analysis 
At first, we precisely define the scope of the privacy that 
our proposed RBPS assures. Our scheme ensures the 
privacy of the banknotes’ bearers against the data recovery 
attack, the access-key tracking, the cookies threat, the 
ciphertext tracking, and the denial of service attack. 
However, a dishonest merchant and the privacy issue that a 
backward channel can be eavesdropped by an attacker are 
beyond the scope of the privacy for our RBPS. 
The argumentation that an attacker cannot intercept a 
backward radio channel from a tag to a reader is reasonable 
due to the following rationales. Generally, there are two 
eavesdropping ranges of RFID protocols- the reader-to-tag 
eavesdropping range (i.e. a forward range), and the tag-to-
reader eavesdropping range (i.e. a backward range) [3]. 
In a forward range, since a reader transmits information 
to a tag with a higher power than a tag, so adversaries could 
easily eavesdrop with the information sent by a reader to a 
tag. This is why the authors in [7] can claim that an attacker 
can intercept a forward channel for an access-key. However, 
in a backward range, since a passive tag on banknote has a 
shorter communication range. Also, a tag has a short 
transmission time than a reader (note: a reader usually 
broadcasts radio signal as long as necessary to bring 
sufficient power to a tag and wait its response). For 
example, in steps (V-2) and ( V -2′ ), a tag just sends the 
numbers r1 and r2 in an extremely short time. As a result, if 
adversaries tend to eavesdrop the information sent by a tag, 
they need a reader staying near the tag and scanning all 
time. So, it is almost impossible to illegally steal r1 and r2 
while the note’s bearer is not aware of an adversary. 
The attacks, exclusive the ciphertext tracking, are 
attributed to the disclosure of the access-keys DM and DL. 
Hence, we first describe why an attacker cannot steal DM and 
DL. An attacker does not physically contact the banknote, so 
he cannot retrieve the ∑ to compute DM=h(∑). Also, an 
attacker cannot intercept the EPC network to get a DL 
because a secure VPN network should be established 
between all LEAs and a central bank. Moreover, we use the 
challenge-response strategy and so that an attacker only has a 
nonce and H(DM||nonce) (or H(DL||nonce)) but he cannot
