FUZZY TIME SERIES METHOD BASED ON SITUATION ADJUSTMENT 
FACTOR 
 
Abstract 
This project proposes a high-order multiple attribute fuzzy time series model, which 
incorporates a clustering method and order weighted averaging (OWA) operator. This 
research improved fuzzy clustering time series concept by Cheng et al.’s [2], further, this 
project combine the Exponential Smoothing method and adjust error method. We use 
exponential Smoothing forecasting and ME-OWA operator to adjust error. The proposed 
model can deal with the fact that there is: (1) a persuasiveness lacking in determining the 
universe of discourse and the linguistic length of intervals, and (2) only one attribute that is 
usually considered in forecasting, not multiple attributes. Furthermore, we can accord a 
different situation α to adjust high order forecasting values. To verify the proposed model, 
we use the yearly data on enrollments at the University of Alabama, TAIFEX (Taiwan 
Futures Exchange), and TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock 
Index) as experimental datasets. Finally, this project compares forecasting performances of 
the proposed methods with Huang et al.’s [1] and Cheng et al.’s [2] models; the results of 
empirical analysis conclude that the proposed model surpasses the listing models in 
accuracy.

3. The Proposed model 
In order to deal with multiple attribute prediction and improve forecasting accuracy, 
this project hence proposes a hybrid model: (1) a clustering method (fuzzy c-mean [15]) for 
the partitioning process and (2) the OWA operator for high order adjusting. 
3.1 Information Fusion Technique 
In this section, we utilized an algorithm in order to calculate the OWA weights [16]. The 
main idea is from equation (2) ~ (4)[16]. The main procedure of the program is simply 
presented as follows (as Fig. 1). 
For example, we compute the OWA weight under n=3 and situation α=0.5~1.0 in Table 1 
3.2 Algorithm of the proposed method 
In this section, we utilize the yearly data on enrollments at the University of Alabama to 
present the proposed algorithm.  
Step 1: Select attributes  
   According to research problem, select attributes by domain experts. From Table 2, the 
yearly enrollments of the University of Alabama only have one attribute; hence, we use 
enrollments as the main attribute. 
 
4. Verifications and comparisons 
In this section, to illustrate how the proposed model performs fuzzy time series 
forecasting, practically collected TAIEX (Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted 
Stock Index) futures and TAIEX data are employed as experiment datasets. Finally, we use 
MSE as a performance indicator to compare the proposed model with Hang et al.’s [1] and 
Cheng et al.’s [2] models.  
Forecasting TAIEX Futures  
In this case, we practically collected TAIEX futures (2004/1/1~2004/12/15) as 
experiment datasets. From this dataset have 208 records, which are utilized 248 records 
(2004/1/1~2004/11/19) as training datasets; others are testing datasets (18 records, 
2004/11/22~2004/12/15). To examine the improvement in performance, three fuzzy time 
series models, Hang et al.’s [1], and Cheng et al.’s [2]] models are employed as comparison 
models. The comparison result is shown in Table 3 and Table 4. We utilize an order from 3 
to 7, and each order has an α value (0.5~1.0). Hence, we compute the average MSE (α 
value:0.5~1.0) as the performance of every order. Clearly, the performance of the proposed 
model surpasses the listing models.  
Forecasting TAIEX  
In this case, we practically collected TAIEX (2000/1/4~2001/12/31) data as experiment 
datasets. We utilized 10 months as training datasets, and 2 months are testing datasets. The 
comparison result is shown in Table 5 ~ Table 8. Clearly, the performance of the proposed 
model surpasses the listing models. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this project, a high-order multiple attribute fuzzy time series method is proposed, 
which employs a fuzzy c-mean clustering method and OWA operator. From the experiment 
results, the performance of the proposed model surpasses the listing models. In order to 
enhance the forecasting accuracy, this project proposed an error adjust method to improve 
forecasting accuracy, and further utilized the OWA operator to decrease the data dimension. 
Moreover, the proposed model can overcome (1) a lack of persuasiveness in determining 
the universe of discourse and the linguistic length of intervals, and (2) that fact that only 
one attribute is usually considered in forecasting, not multiple attributes. Besides, we 
utilized a different situation α to adjust high order forecasting values. Finally, from the 
compared result, we can see that the proposed model outperforms the listing models. Based 
on the verification results, we conclude that the research goal has been reached.

1. Introduction
In recent years, time-series models have utilized the fuzzy theory to solve various forecasting
problems, such as university enrolment forecasting [3], financial forecasting [1, 4] and temperature
forecasting [5]. Many researchers have proposed different methods to predict stock price based on
fuzzy time series. In 1993, Song and Chissom[6] proposed the first fuzzy time series method, where
the definitions, the time-invariant model[4] and the time-variant model[1] of fuzzy time series were
presented. The following research proposed simple calculation methods to get a higher forecasting
accuracy [3]. Huang and Yu utilized two methods, distribution-based and average-based length, to
set the linguistic intervals of the universe of discourse to improve forecasting accuracy [1]. From
the literature above, there are drawbacks: (1) Many factors in stock markets, such as financial report,
macro economical data, and the fluctuations of foreign stock markets, influence practically the
decisions of stock investors, and, therefore, multiple attributes should be considered in forecasting
model. (2) In stock market forecasting, it is not reasonable to partition the universe of the discourse
for dataset because the distribution of stock price is not uniform.
Therefore, this paper proposes a multiple attribute fuzzy time series model, which corporate a
clustering method and order weighted averaging (OWA) operator. The proposed model can deal
with (1) lacking persuasiveness in determining the universe of discourse and the linguistic length of
intervals, and (2) only one attribute is usually considered in forecasting not multiple attributes.
Furthermore, we can according to diferent situation α to adjust forecasting value.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 introduces the related literature of fuzzy
time-series model, Order Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator; in section 3, demonstrates the
proposed model and algorithm; section 4 evaluates the performance of the proposed model; and,
finally, conclusions are presented in section 5.

where actual(t) is the actual observations on time t; forecast(t) is the forecasting value; and n is the
number of periods for forecasts.
3. The Proposed model
In order to deal with multiple attribute prediction and improve forecasting accuracy, hence, this
paper proposes a hybrid model: (1) clustering method (fuzzy c-mean [15]) for partitioning process,
and (2) OWA operator for high order adjusting.
3.1 OWA weight
In this section, we utilized an algorithm in order to calculate the OWA weights [16]. The main idea is
from equation (2) ~ (4)[16]. The main procedure of the program is simply presented as following (as fig. 1):

For example, we compute OWA weight under n=3 and situationα=0.5~1.0 in table1

3.2 Algorithm of the proposed method
In this section, we utilize the yearly data on enrollments at the University of Alabama to present the
proposed algorithm.
Step 1: Select attributes
According to research problem, select attributes by domain experts. From table 2, the yearly
enrollments of the University of Alabama only have one attribute; hence, we use enrollments as main
attribute.
Step 2: Computing difference of each period
In this step, we calculate difference of each period. From table 1, difference of 1971 and 1972 is
508(=13563-13055). Therefore, we can get difference of each period in table 2.
Step 3: Cluster multi-attributes time series S(t)
Supposed a time series S(t) with n observations of m attributes, an appropriate fuzzy clustering
procedure is selected to cluster time series S(t) into c ( 2 c n  ) clusters in this step. In this study, FCM is
chosen because it is one of the fuzzy clustering methods.
According to (Miller, 1956), seven (linguistic value) is utilized as the number of clusters for
demonstration to correspond with the limitation of human cognition in shorten memory. Hence, we use
difference of each period into FCM by equation (3).
Step 4: Rank each cluster and fuzzify the time series S(t) as fuzzy time series F(t)
In table 2, we ranked each of cluster center value and got linguistic value.
Step 5: Fuzzify the historical data
For different  and n, we can get different OWA weight. /* n is the number of attributes;  is the situation
parameter */
