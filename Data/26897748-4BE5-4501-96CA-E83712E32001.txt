shaped passively by the result of the previous sleep 
cycle without any information about traffic load or 
characteristics. 
In order to accurately determine the proper sleep 
schedule, the idea of Load-Based Power Saving (LBPS) 
has been proposed in our previous research projects. 
LBPS models and measures traffic proactively, and the 
sleep schedule is then determined by traffic 
characteristics obtained. Three LBPS schemes for MSS 
sleep schedule have been proposed, LBPS-Aggr, LBPS-
Split, and LBPS-Merge. In this project, power saving 
at the base station (BS) is considered, and 
previously proposed LBPS schemes are to be revised 
for accommodating both MSS and BS sleep schedule for 
more power saving in the IEEE 802.16e network. Two 
strategies of integrated power saving, MSS-first and 
BS-first, with associated sleep scheduling mechanisms 
are proposed as the outcome of the project. 
Simulation study shows that the proposed schemes can 
effectively achieve high power saving efficiency for 
both BS and MSS.

, where T is the length of a time
frame.
The threshold of data accumulation is
denoted by Data_TH (packets), which is
practically set as the capacity of a time frame.
The probability of data accumulation exceeding
Data_TH packets over K time frames in a row
can be calculated as follows:

The number of time frames (including the
current awake time frame) before the next
awake time frame for an MSS is calculated as
the smallest value of K such that PAcc(K,
Data_TH) is higher than a predefined
probability threshold denoted by Prob_TH. That
is,
The length of one awake-and-sleep cycle
LengthAwkSlpCyl (, Data_TH)K*
= }),(|{ Prob_THData_THKPKMin Acc  ,
where an awake-and-sleep cycle is
composed of the current awake time frame
and the following sleep window.
The size of the sleep window in a cycle is
therefore K*-1, which is sent by the BS to the
currently awake MSSs to prepare for entering
the sleep mode.
2. LBPS-Split and LBPS-Merge
LBPS-Split was proposed to improve the
performance of LBPS-Aggr in power saving as
explained briefly by the following example.
Considering the case that K* = 2 (the length of
the awake-and-sleep cycle is 2 time frames) in
LBPS-Aggr, conceptually it implies all MSSs as
a whole should be assigned with one awake
time frame out of the cycle of two time frames.
But in the schedule we could also split the
MSSs into two groups and assign a different
awake time frame for each group. Given that the
load of a split group is always lighter than the
load of the original and bigger group, it’s very
likely that the new K* value for each of the split
groups (with the same value of Data_TH) is
larger than the original value of 2. The case of
the minimal value of the two new K* values
larger than 2 implies the feasibility of further
splitting, which leads to the protocol of
LBPS-Split.
The best case of LBPS-Split in power saving
is that each of the split groups is composed of a
single MSS, and the final value of K* is
therefore determined by the MSS with least load.
In such case, with the same length (the final K*)
of the awake-and-sleep cycle, each MSS is
assigned with one whole awake time frame in a
cycle. The idea leads to another perspective of
grouping MSSs in sleep scheduling. Instead of
treating all MSSs as one group from the start,
we could firstly make each MSS a
single-member group for K* calculation. Since
the load of each MSS varies, each group usually
has a different value of K*. In order to achieve a
better gain of power saving, the sleep
scheduling algorithm should be able to
accommodate different values of K* as long as a
feasible sleep schedule can be found. In the case
that a feasible sleep schedule cannot be found
for the current state of grouping, merging of
some groups is necessary. The idea of treating
each MSS as a single-member group from the
start and merging groups when necessary leads
to another enhanced protocol namely
LBPS-Merge.
Since it’s dificult to check the 
schedulability of groups with any possible value
of K*, the value of K* is converted to the closest
and smaller power of 2, denoted by K#
(i.e.  *22# KLogK  ) in LBPS-Merge. With the
property of powers of 2, a quick check for
schedulability can be obtained. Schedulability
of a number of groups with different K# values
is defined by the following equation.
Schedulability = 
i iK
#
1
4different MSS can be further extended to
support BS power saving. Given KBS# =
 BSK2log2 and  1_  THPSEKBS , it implies one
out of KBS# time frames should be assigned as
BS’s sleep time frame in order to meet PSE_TH.
Therefore, the revised algorithm of
LBPS-Merge under S2 treats BS as a special
MSS with its own KBS# value in sleep
scheduling. Following changes are made for
LBPS-Merge under S2:
(1) For MSS groups, the value of K# means one
awake time frame out of K# time frames.
Oppositely, the value of KBS# means one
sleep time frame out of KBS# time frames for
BS.
(2) Since no MSS should be in the awake mode
when BS is in the sleep mode, BS cannot be
merged with MSS.
(3) The equation of Schedulability is revised to
include BS’s power saving as follows:
Schedulability = ##

An example of LBPS-Merge under S2 is
given in Fig. 6. The detail algorithm of
LBPS-Merge under S2 is presented in Fig. 7.
五、結果與討論 Result & Discussion
Simulation study was conducted to evaluate
the performance of the proposed schemes. A
PMP (point-to-multipoint) network consisting of
a base station and a certain number of MSSs
was simulated. The traffic pattern for each MSS
was assumed to be Poisson process. Simulation
parameters are summarized in Table 1.
Table 1: Simulation Parameters
# of MSS 10, 40
# of mini-slots in a time frame 100
Size of packet 1 mini-slot
Data_TH 80 packets
Prob_TH 0.8
Traffic pattern Poisson
Simulation time 105 sec
Three performance criteria were defined in
the simulation as presented in the following. (1)
Power saving efficiency, denoted by PSE, is
defined as the ratio of time entering the sleep
mode. For instance, for one awake time frame in
a cycle of K time frames for a device (BS or
MSS), the value of the device’s PSE is
calculated as (K-1)/K. The value of PSE for BS
or for the group of MSSs is computed by
averaging all samples in the simulation. (2) The
average access delay, denoted by AvgDelay, is
defined as the average time for a downlink
packet from the BS to reach the destination
MSS. (3) Total power consumption, in the unit
of watts (W), is measured by adding up the
power consumption of BS and all MSSs.
1. Performance results in S1
PSE of LBPS schemes under S1 is displayed
in Fig. 8, noting that PSE for BS and PSE for
MSSs in LBPS-Aggr are the same curve since
they are treated as a single group in the scheme.
If only BS’s PSE is considered, Fig. 8 shows
LBPS-Aggr is better than the others with the
following reason. Since the goal of LBPS-Split
and LBPS-Merge in S1 is to maximize MSS’s
PSE by grouping MSSs and assigning different
sleep frame to each group, BS’s PSE, which is
affected by the degree of overlapping of the
sleep frames, is compromised in both schemes.
Fig. 8 also shows LBPS-Merge outperforms the
others if both BS’s PSE and MSS’s PSE are
taken into consideration.
AvgDelay of MSS in S1 is displayed in Fig.
9, which presents complicated relationship
among LBPS schemes as the total load goes up.
The behavior of the access delay in a power
saving scheme is affected by multiple factors as
explained in the following. Firstly, the access
delay goes up as the input load goes up
according to the principle of the queuing theory.
Secondly, the length of the awake-and-sleep
cycle of an MSS makes the upper bound of the
waiting time in the buffer, meaning that the
more power saving at an MSS, the longer
waiting time the MSS would observe. Thirdly,
BS power saving would also affect the access
delay, since the more power saving at the BS,
the less available bandwidth (capacity) MSSs
