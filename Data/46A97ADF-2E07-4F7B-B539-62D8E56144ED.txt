2. Motivation and Objectives
There are many methods available for
handling a singular integral, for example,
analytical formulas and adaptive integration.
Many books of the boundary element
method mention only exact analytical for-
mulas or linear elements; nevertheless, there
is no research that has ever described
higher-order elements and the solution of
the equations. Some scholars considered
that deriving formulas to integrate singular
integrals is extremely difficult on space
surface elements. Hence, a new method
must be proposed to efficiently solve the
boundary integral equations.
This thesis proposed a simple
technique to handle the singular integral in a
three dimensional element. Instead of
deriving an analytic form, a different
approach is construed. Two line integrals
along the boundary of elements are used to
transform two types of singular integrals,
source and doublet singularities, into line
integrals. Then by using such identities, the
order of singularity of singular is reduced.
This is similar to the WS Hwang, LP Hung,
CH Ko. [1], which proposes to handle the
singular integral in two dimensional
elements. That idea used an analytical
formula to subtract a singular integrand
from a singular integral and then add it
back.
Since the engineering problems are
often solved by differential equation tech-
niques, the present research aims to trans-
form the governing equation of potential
flows from a differential equation to an
integral equation and then to solve the
velocity potential or its normal derivatives
by numerical methods. However, it can be
solved more effectively by the boundary
integral equation methods. Therefore,
improvement of the Singular Integral of
three dimensional boundary integral equa-
tions, which makes the integral equation
even more efficient, is the focus of this
thesis.
3. Theoretical and Numerical Analysis
a. Boundary integral equation
The common expression of a boundary
integral equation can be described as:
( ) ( ) ( ) Q QS S
Q Q
G
P P Q dS G dS
n n
     
   ,(1)
where P represents a source point, and Q a
point on the boundary S. The free space
Green's function G, based on the three-
dimensional Laplace equation, is given as
-1
4 ( , )
G
r P Q


(2)
where ),( QPr is the distance between points
P and Q. In general, the free term coefficient
 equals 1 when P inside the domain, 1/2
when P on the smooth part of the boundary,
and zero outside the domain. More precisely,
the coefficient  can be expressed as a flux
such that
( ) QS
Q
G
P dS
n
 
 (3)
Substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (1), one has
   

The singular term comes from the second
integral in the right-hand side of Eq. (4), and it
is only weakly singular. As for the first integral,
it is regular one and can be computed easily.
b. Singular elements
The fundamental solution G becomes
singular when P and Q are coincident. For an
arbitrary smooth surface, )(P in Eq. (3) can
be interpreted as a solid angle, and it can be
calculated as a line integral along its boundary
curve. Its expression is simply shown in Eq.
(5), as for the detailed derivation can be found
