英文摘要 
Asynchronous designs have been adopt by 
many portable devices due to its less power 
consumption on clock activities than 
synchronous designs [1]-[3]. Dynamic voltage 
scaling (DVS) techniques and boosted voltage 
technique are employed to further reduced the 
power consumption of a SoC while maintain 
required performance. Thus, silicon-IPs for those 
SoCs need the capability in wide 
operation-voltage range.  
However, embedded asynchronous SRAM 
is one of the bottlenecks for SoCs with capability 
in wide operation-voltage range. Various 
supply-voltages cause different timing skews

圖一: Timing Skews。 
 
In nominal asynchronous SRAM, the 
precharge phase happens at the  beginning and 
precedes before the data-access phase in each 
cycle to satisfy the requirement of a 
non-negative data-to-address hold-time for 
writing the last-minute-updated input-data 
[7]-[9]. Accordingly, the access time (TAC) of an 
asynchronous SRAM is longer than that of a 
synchronous SRAM with the same sub-circuits 
[8]. Furthermore, the precharge time in 
asynchronous SRAM is fixed at design time and 
cannot be extended by relaxing the cycle time, as 
in synchronous SRAM. 
Inverter chains are commonly employed in 
conventional SRAM to generate the required 
timing for precharge and data-access phases. 
However, the delays of the inverter chains hardly 
match all of the timing variations of the bitline 
activities across a wide range of supply voltages 
[9], [12], [14]. Therefore, timing skews occur for 
the conventional SRAM when the supply voltage 
is reduced or boosted. 
Fig. 1 shows the normalized timing skews on 
the precharge time of three inverter-based delay 
cells for a cell array with 256 rows. These delay 
cells are designed to match the required 
precharge time for a given drain current of 
precharge transistors at VDD=3.3V but with 
various chain stages and channel lengths. The 
positive timing skew indicates that a delay cell 
generates more time than is required for bitline 
precharge. This increase in the precharge time 
reduces the speed of asynchronous SRAM, 
especially the designs 
precharge transistor and a timing control unit 
(TCU), as presented in Fig. 2. The dummy 
column, whose bitline pair is DMYBLB and 
DMYBL, comprises dummy cells: dummy drive 
cells (DDC) and dummy load cells (DLC). 
Precharge-tracking Circuit 
 
The precharge-tracking circuit in SDMST 
utilizes one dummy bitline, DMYBLB, a voltage 
detector for precharge (VDP), a TCU, and a 
dummy precharge transistor (DPT) to track the 
precharge behavior on regular bitlines across 
various processes, supply voltages and 
temperature (PVT) conditions. 
The total number of dummy cells, DLC and 
DDC, on the dummy column equals the number 
of memory cells on a regular bitline. During the 
precharge phase, DLCs and DDCs remain 
inactive and act as the bitline load. Both DLC 
and DDC have the same device layout as a 
regular memory cell but the connection of the 
metal wires differs slightly to have the same 
parasitic effects as a regular memory cell. Thus, 
DMYBLB and DMYBL have the same parasitic 
capacitance and resistance as regular bitlines 
(BL/BLB).  
The DATAB of both DLC and DDC is fixed at 
logical ”0” by wiring the gates of PD2 and PU2 
to VDD, as  shown in Fig. 3. When BLB is at a 
low voltage, those memory cells with DATAB=1 
provide a charging leakage current to BLB 
through the pass transistors (PG2). When BLB is 
at a high voltage, those memory cells with 
DATAB=0 provide a discharging leakage 
current to BLB. The charging bitline leakage 
current increases the precharge current on 
bitlines and reduces the required precharge time. 
In contrast, the discharging bitline leakage 
current erodes the precharge current on bitlines 
and increases the required precharge time. With 
the proposed data-setting of DLC and DDC cells, 
the maximum discharging leakage current on 
regular bitlines is duplicated on DMYBLB for 
bitline precharge activity. This makes the 
SDMST technique sustainable across various 
PVT conditions at which the leakage current is 
significant.   
The DPT and VDP are located at opposite 
ends of the DMYBLB to track the RC delay of a 
bitline. The DPT, at the bottom of the dummy 
column, is duplicated from regular precharge 
transistors. Accordingly, the DPT provides the 
same precharge current as regular precharge 
transistors under various PVT conditions. The 
VDP is placed at the top of the dummy column 
to detect the voltage on DMYBLB. When the 
voltage on DMYBLB reaches the target voltage, 
the VDP emits a PRE_C signal to TCU to 
indicate the completion of the precharge phase 
and turn off the PRE signal.  
Since the DMYBLB duplicates the precharge 
current, the worst-case bitline leakage current 
and the parasitic RC of regular bitlines, the 
voltage on DMYBLB during the precharge 
phase is the same as that of the regular bitlines 
with worst-case bitline leakage under various 
PVT conditions.  
Sense-tracking Circuit 
The sense-tracking circuit in SDMST employs 
one dummy bitline, DMYBL, a TCU (share with 
precharge-tracking circuit), and a voltage 
detector for data-sensing (VDS) to track the 
sensing behavior on bitlines. This circuit adopts 
the current-ratio scheme [12] but have different 
dummy cells compared to other tracking 
schemes [10]-[14].  
k DDCs and (i-k) DLCs are present on the 
dummy column for an SRAM with i rows. The 
DDC duplicates the cell current of a nominal 
memory cell and acts as the source of discharge 
current on DMYBL during data-sensing activity. 
The Data in DDC is set to logical “0” by wiring 
the gates of PD1 and PU1 to VDD, as shown in 
Fig. 3. The DATAB in DDC is also set to logical 
“0” to duplicate the bitline leakage during 
precharge activity, as discussed earlier. Unlike 
the dummy cell without the PMOS transistors 
[14], the DDC utilizes metal wires to set the 
stored data without changing the layout of the 
devices in a memory cell: the poly and diffusion 
layers. This layout scheme achieves good 
matching in the devices and the memory cell 
current between a DDC and a nominal memory 
cell. The data-setting for both sensing and 
precharge activities causes the circuit of DDC to 
differ from those of other dummy cells in

The SDMST technique achieves good speed 
and a wide range of supply-voltages within the 
constraints of the employed technology. The

SDMST technique, 212.1% of nominal VDD

asynchronous SRAMs [5]-[8]. The access time 
and its voltage-induced speed degradation 
penalty are also less than that of previously 
reported wide voltage-range asynchronous 
SRAM [8] (Vth=0.5V, TAC =200ns at 5V, TAC 
=3000ns at VDD=1V).

A SDMST technique is proposed to reduce 
the timing skew in the precharge and the sensing 
operations of asynchronous SRAM across 
reduced and boosted supply voltages. The 
SDMST is developed by considering the effects 
of parasitic RC and the data-dependent leakage 
current on dummy bitlines. The SDMST 
employs only one dummy column and has the 
same area overhead as other sense-tracking-only 
techniques. The fabricated SDMST SRAM 
macros demonstrated a wide range of operating 
voltages, from 39.4% to 212.1% of the nominal 
supply voltage. The scalability of the SDMST 
technique was also verified using fabricated 
macros with various bitline lengths but the same 
peripheral circuit.

Abstract  
 
This work develops a hidden clustered source line control (HCSLC) technique to reduce the standby current of an 
embedded SRAM with zero area overhead. The HCSLC scheme utilizes meshed multiple source line control to reduce 
the fluctuations of virtual ground voltages that are caused by IR drops and process variations. A clustered device-hidden 
layout scheme is employed to produce compact SRAM layout and attenuate the effects of location/direction-dependent 
process variations on source line control circuits. A 512Kb HCSLC SRAM testchip was fabricated using the 0.18um 
CMOS process. The HCSLC SRAM achieves 69%~77% reductions of standby current for various processes, supply 
voltages and temperatures (PVT). The data retention voltage in sleep mode is 0.1V~0.15V higher than that in normal 
mode for the HCSLC SRAM. 
 
1. Introduction  
 
Static random access memories (SRAMs) are commonly embedded into system-on-chip (SoC) designs for storing 
programs and data. The subthreshold leakage current increases substantially as the process is scaled down. Accordingly, 
suppressing the leakage current of embedded SRAM is important for SoC designs, especially for battery-powered 
applications.  
Previous works [1]-[6] have employed sleep transistors or gated-ground approaches to reduce the leakage current of 
SRAMs. These schemes reduce the subthreshold leakage by exploiting body effects and smaller drain-to-source voltage 
in sleep mode. However, those schemes have 4%~20.7% area overheads associated with the source line control circuits. 
Furthermore, parasitic resistance of controlled source lines/virtual-ground lines and process variations in sleep 
transistors cause non-uniform virtual-ground voltage in previously developed low-leakage SRAMs.  
saturated virtual-ground voltage in sleep mode is determined by all the sleep transistors, instead of by a single sleep 
transistor. This approach prevents fluctuations in the virtual-ground voltages across various rows or banks due to 
process variations in the sleep transistors. The virtual-ground lines are also meshed in the cell array to reduce the IR 
drop. The MMSLC is placed at two edges of the cell array with metal rings around the cell array. Therefore, the 
voltages of the virtual ground across the various cell locations are more uniform and exhibits a lower IR drop than in 
other studies [1]-[6].

2.3 Clustered Device-Hidden Layout Scheme 
The height of an SRAM cell is such that row-controlled sleep transistor schemes normally have involved significant 
(4%~21%) area overhead associated with the source line control circuits. The layout of the centralized source line bias 
circuits is not suitable for configurable memories or memory compilers, which require small increasing steps in 
rows/columns to generate various memory configurations [7]-[9]. Furthermore, the direction-dependent process 
variations cause various bank-to-bank or die-to-die variations in virtual-ground voltages in those schemes in which 
sleep transistors are laid out in single direction. 
Figure 3 displays the proposed clustered device-hidden layout (PIDHL) scheme for MMSLC. The multiple sleep and 
clamp transistors are divided into two sets of sub-circuits - X-clusters and Y-clusters. Each cluster comprises an NMOS 
sleep transistor and an NMOS voltage clamper. The layout of the X-cluster fits the height of two SRAM cells, with 
vertical poly-gates and diffusion layers. The Y-cluster is laid out to fit the width of two SRAM cells, with horizontal 
poly-gates and diffusion layers. Both clusters can be tiled repeatedly to produce various memory configurations, with a 
minimum row/column increment of 2. Since the MMSLC circuits are physically distributed in both vertical and 
horizontal directions, the device mismatch associated with location-dependent and direction-dependent process 
variations can be attenuated by the PIDHL scheme.

 Both X-cluster and Y-cluster are physically hidden under the regular power/ground rings of an embedded SRAM to 
eliminate any area overhead. Since the body bias effect in sleep mode is essential to reducing the subthreshold leakage 
of SRAM cells, the bias of the body of the NMOS transistors in SRAM cells should be at real ground - not virtual 
ground. However, meshed VSSm (for SRAM cells) and VSS (for body bias) cannot easily co-exist in a cell array 
without an area overhead. Thus, the VSS lines are laid out only vertically in strap cells (SC) and are strapped in the 
Table 1 presents the percentage reductions in standby current in sleep mode at various supply voltages. The leakage 
reduction is effective across various supply voltages. The sleep mode yields the largest reduction at low supply voltage. 
Combining low supply voltage and sleep mode most reduces the standby current. Furthermore, the sleep mode provides 
a narrower distribution at low supply voltage.

3.3 Various Temperatures 
The standby currents of the samples from foundry-A are characterized at VDD=1.8V and three temperatures - 25°C, 
85°C and 125°C. Figure 6 plots the measured leakage currents in both normal mode and sleep mode at the three 
temperatures. The leakage reductions in sleep mode at 25°C, 85°C and 125°C are 69.3%, 69.1% and 68.9%, 
respectively. Clearly, the standby currents in sleep mode are more narrowly distributed than those in normal mode at 
high temperatures. Accordingly, the HSLC technique is also effective for SRAM at various temperatures. 
 
3.4 Data Retention Voltage 
Since the source line voltage in sleep mode exceeds that in normal mode, the cell stability at a low supply voltage is 
degraded in sleep mode. The minimum data retention voltages in sleep mode of HSLC SRAM are 0.1V~0.15V higher 
than those in normal mode [11], as shown in Fig. 7.

4. Summary  
 
An HCSLC technique is developed to reduce the subthreshold leakage current for embedded compilable SRAM. The 
standby currents of a 512Kb HCSLC SRAM under various PVT conditions were measured. The meshed multiple 
source line control circuit and clustered device-hidden layout scheme improve the uniformity of virtual-ground voltages 
of an SRAM against location/direction-dependent process variations with zero area overhead.
