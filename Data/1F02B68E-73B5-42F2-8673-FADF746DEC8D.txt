Abstract in English 
 
Due to redundancy in the morphology, 
dynamic cine cardiac MR imaging exhibits 
room for acquisition acceleration using the data 
sharing methods in the spatiaotemporal (k-t) 
domain.  A method reported in the past 
literature utilized several sets of basis functions 
in the x-f space to reconstruct the k-t domain 
data, with the basis extracted from another 
acquisition of the low-spatial-resolution training 
data using principal component analysis (PCA).  
This method is termed k-t PCA.  However, 
limited scan time allowed for training data 
acquisition resulted into insufficient 
representation of the true data set, causing 
increased reconstruction errors in k-t PCA.  In 
our study, we proposed the use of pre-acquired 
data set from the same anatomy, but from 
different subjects, as the training data to 
generate the basis functions.  By including 
multiple data sets, better representation of the 
true data can be achieved.  Both computer 
simulation and real experiments were performed, 
in which the images from six subjects were used 
as training data to generate the basis sets to 
reconstruct another four subject’s images.  
Results show that reduced reconstruction errors 
can be achieved both globally and within the 
myocardium.  Not only the accuracy becomes 
improved, but the removal of training data 
acquisition also shortens the total scan time 
even further.  Therefore, we conclude that 
prior-data-driven k-t PCA as proposed in this 
study not only is an effective means for cardiac 
MR imaging with high acceleration factors, but 
also alleviates possible inconsistencies due to 
motion between acquisitions of the training data 
and the actual images. 
 
Keywords: cine cardiac MR imaging, k-t PCA;

二、計畫緣由與目的 
 
Dynamic MR imaging, such as cine cardiac 
aliasing mechanism. The aliased y-f profile 
( )alias yP  for a specific phase-encoding location 
can be encoded using the PCs (2) (accelerating 
ratio is assumed to be 4). For clarity, the 
overview of the aliasing encoding mechanism is 
shown in Fig. 1c. If multiple imaging coils are 
available, sensitivity encoding can be integrated 
into k-t PCA (1,2,6). 
 
The essential part of the reconstruction is 
how to estimate a set of “good” PCs, by which 
we can encode homogeneous y-f profiles more 
efficiently.  The concept of efficient encoding 
involves dimensionality reduction and 
reconstructing a good approximation of the 
original y-f profile from the subspace of reduced 
dimension. An original y-f profile can be 
expressed as a linear combination of 
frequency-shifted versions of unit impulse 
[ ]f : 
0
0
1
0[ ]
fN
y
f
ff f w

 P     [1] 
and is a sample point in a Nf –dimension space 
which is composed of Nf individual unit impulse 
vectors. The y-f profiles from a set of 
homogeneous dynamic series, being similar in 
configuration, will not be randomly distributed 
in this huge space, and can be described by a 
relatively low dimensional subspace. A popular 
approach to find the subspace from large 
samples is PCA. The PCA (7) method captures 
the variation in a collection of y-f profiles of 
homogeneous dynamic series, and the variation 
can hence explain characteristics among these 
samples. In mathematical term, the PCA 
methods wish to find the eigenvectors of the 
covariance matrix of these y-f profiles, and the 
low dimensional subspace is composed of these 
eigenvectors which we shall call the PCs. 
 
From the statistical point of view, PCA 
often reveals arbitrary but essential feature that 
is not previously suspected from a large sample 
dataset, and thus allows alternatively encode 
and reconstruct y-f profiles with PCs from a set 
of homogeneous samples instead of from 
low-resolution training data which may be 
inconsistent with the imaged object. 
 
Fig. 2a shows the 10 PCs with highest 
eigenvalues which allow us to sort the PCs 
according to decreasing order of “significance”. 
A substantially small number of PCs can 
account for most of the variation as described in 
Fig. 2b. An individual y-f profile can hence be 
encoded using Eq.[1] with a set of PCs with 
highest eigenvalues, and  represented as a 
sample points in NPC-dimensional subspace 
which is composed of NPC PCs (columns of 
C ). 
 
We reconstruct unaliased y-f profiles from 
down-sampled data of a given accelerating ratio 
by solving the weightings of PCs ,alias yW  in Eq. 
[3]. The equation can be solved using the least 
square method: ,( )
H H
y alias y  w E EE I P , 
where xw  denotes the weightings of the best 
PCs for each unaliased y-f signal, E  is the 
encoding matrix with the best PCs, and ,alias yP  
is the aliasing y-f profile for specific spatial 
position y , respectively. I  is a term of 
regularization. 
 
We assume the geometrical distribution of 
receiving coils is orthogonal, and there are Nf Nc 
conditions for solving the NPCR unknown 
variables (the weightings of the PCs of R aliased 
y-f profiles). NPC may be small if the set of PCs 
are sufficiently representative, and Nc can be 
larger than 1 if we exploit information from 
multiple receiving coils.  The reconstruction 
problem is consequently over-determined when 
Nf Nc ≧ NPCR, which makes the reconstruction 
more stable and avoids amplification of noise. 
 
A set of PCs used for reconstruction are 
extracted intentionally from six pre-existing 
short-axis cine cardiac series by PCA. These 
pre-existing series were obtained on a Siemens 
Trio 3T scanner and a GE 1.5T HDx scanner. 
They were acquired at similar anatomical 
position of the to-be-imaged object, while 
acquired from different healthy subjects and 
different experiments. Table 1 shows the 
selected frames of the pre-existing data. 
 
The y-f profiles within regions of interest 
(ROIs) placed in the left ventricles of these 
series (red rectangles in table 1) contain the 
most important frequency information of 
dynamics in ventricular myocardium. Therefore, 
only these y-f profiles were exploited, and there 
bSI  is the signal intensity of blood, mSI  is the 
signal intensity of myocardium, and background 
noise is assumed to be 2 2b nSD SD  since the 
signal intensity of image background may 
influenced by residual aliasing. 
 
四、結果與討論 
 
Fig. 3a reports the averaged relative RMS error 
of reconstruction by prior-data-driven k-t PCA 
and conventional k-t PCA. The overall RMSE is 
mostly below 4%, and slightly rises as 
accelerating ratio increases. As can be seen in 
the figure, the error of conventional k-t PCA is 
significantly higher. It is 1% higher than that of 
prior-data-driven k-t PCA within the ROI of 
myocardium which possesses rich dynamic 
information and is indentified as the most 
demanding part of reconstruction. This confirms 
that our proposed method provided improved 
reconstruction when compared with 
conventional k-t PCA even from substantially 
down-sampled data. 
 
We further examined the result of 
reconstructing 8-fold accelerated data. Fig. 3d 
shows selected images from systolic and 
diastolic phases with corresponding absolute 
differences from true images. For conventional 
k-t PCA, although a slight loss of image details 
is discernible, the structure of reconstructed 
images is well preserved. For our proposed 
method, the reconstructed images preserved the 
overall details even better, and all image 
structures were retained faithfully. In Fig. 3b, 
we can see that our proposed method captured 
the overall dynamics well. Note that the mean 
intensity within myocardium ROI presented a 
sharp drop during systolic phases (time frame 
number 1 to number 10), and prior-data-driven 
k-t PCA endured much less error within these 
phases than conventional k-t PCA as shown in 
Fig. 3c. 
 
Fig. 3e presents the effect of different 
amounts of pre-existing series for reconstruction. 
The optimal number of pre-existing series is six, 
the elbow point of the curve, and the 
performance would not be further improved if 
more series are used by PCA. The errors of 
prior-data-driven k-t PCA with sufficient 
pre-existing series, moreover, were apparently 
less than those of conventional k-t PCA and 
compartment-based k-t PCA with training data 
from a ROI placed at left ventricle. Therefore, 
we exploit the set of PCs from six pre-existing 
series for all simulations and experiments. 
 
The in vivo experimental results are 
reported in Fig. 4, and note that these images 
cannot be compared by pixel to pixel since they 
were acquired from different experiments. As 
the images shown, the non-accelerated reference 
suffered from motion artifacts caused by 
breathing (green arrow), and reconstruction of 
under-sampled data slightly exhibited residual 
aliasing artifacts as arrows indicates. The 
anatomy was well preserved even from 
substantially under-sampled data, while blurring 
of myocardium at systolic phase was revealed 
when data was 8-fold and 6-fold accelerated 
(white arrows). CNR decreased as the 
accelerating ratio increased, while the decrease 
did not result in apparent effect on image quality. 
The results of in-vivo experiments conform to 
those of in-vivo simulation as expected, and 
demonstrated the feasibility of prior-data-driven 
k-t PCA in actually under-sampled data. 
 
Our study makes use of information from 
pre-existing series to encode the y-f profiles of 
imaged object, and is fundamentally different 
from the conventional k-t approaches exploiting 
training data of imaged object to acquire prior 
information. The elimination of acquiring 
training data simultaneously avoids the 
additional scanning time and imaging process, 
which results in improved temporal resolution 
and reconstruction. The present approach, 
moreover, is successfully integrated with 
parallel imaging to provide even better 
reconstruction. We have had simulations and 
experiments on healthy subjects, and the results 
further confirmed the feasibility and superiority 
of the proposed method. 
 
In the result of in-vivo simulation, Fig. 3b 
shows that conventional k-t PCA did not suffer 
from smoothing signal while retained the signal 
dynamics with errors, which was found in the 
original result of conventional k-t PCA as well 
(2). These findings have important implications 
about difference between PCs from pre-existing 
Within the past three fiscal years, the project 
investigator has generated about 19 journal 
articles, three (13-15) being directly supported 
financially by this grant, even though the topics 
may be at some variance to the specific aims. In 
addition, a total of 36 conference papers were 
published in one single conference (ISMRM). 
Eight graduate students, among whom two were 
executing this project at least in part, have 
graduated with their Ph.D. degrees. In short, we 
have confidence that the execution of our 
three-year project can be regarded as highly 
successful, both scientifically and educationally, 
with potentially positive impact on better 
utilization of kt-space data sharing methods in 
routine clinical MR examinations.

Fig. 2. a: 10 PCs with highest eigenvalues extracted from pre-existing datasets. The order of 
PCs is determined by their eigenvalues, which correspond to the significance. That is to say, 
PC1 with the highest eigenvalue means the most essential frequency basis; while lower 
eigenvalue corresponds to less essential frequency basis. b: Eigenvalues of 24 PCs extracted 
from pre-existing datasets in log scale. The eigenvalues decrease rapidly and energy is 
generally concentrated in the top few PCs. In this case, 99.89% of all energy is contained 
within the first 10 PCs, with ignorable low eigenvalue at above 10th PCs; hence, we can 
exploit the first 10 PCs for efficiently encoding.

Target audience: MR physicists and pulse sequence engineers working on cardiac imaging. 
Purpose 
T1 mapping of the heart  provides a quantitative method to visualize and evaluate structure variances1. Quantification of the pre- and post-contrast T1 change in 
late gadolinium enhancement allows the assessment of cardiac disease status 2,3. For cardiac T1 mapping, modified Look-Locker inversion-recovery (MOLLI) has 
been demonstrated reliable and been widely used in clinical applications4. However, the MOLLI protocol requires patients to hold their breath for about seventeen 
heartbeats. This requirement could be an obstacle to apply MOLLI on patients unable to perform long voluntary breath-hold. In this study, inspired by a recently 
study presenting a fast 3D whole brain T1 mapping5, we proposed a rapid cardiac T1 mapping method where only 
three heartbeats from MOLLI data are needed.  
Methods 
The rapid cardiac T1 mapping is based on the “ratio” method which was previously reported to achieve 3D whole 
brain T1 mapping5. It requires three gradient-echo images to sample the relaxation curve after an inversion pulse. 
The first and second images were divided by third image to generate two ratio images in which the B1 
inhomogeneity is compensated. The relaxation model of these two ratio images is derived according to the Bloch’s 
equations with the parameters of T1, delay times, flip-angle and efficiency of inversion-recovery pulse. A 
Levenberg-Marquardt least-square curve fitting with the relaxation model and the two ratio images was employed 
to generate T1 mapping. The data acquisition scheme is fully compatible to the MOLLI sequence with 3-3-5 
acquisition scheme4. We used the first three images obtained in the MOLLI sequence to perform ratio-based T1 
calculation. This method is termed Ratio-T1 method hereafter. 
Six healthy participants (males, age: 23±2.45) underwent T1 mapping study with a 3.0 Tesla scanner (Siemens, 
Tim Trio) after providing informed consent. We performed MOLLI imaging using the following parameters: 
TR/TE: 2.72/1.3 ms, matrix: 256×208, flip angle: 8°, 2-fold GRAPPA acceleration, four slice orientations: basal, 
mid-cavity, apical and two-chamber, measurement number: 3, MOLLI acquisition scheme: 3-3-5. The in vivo 
experiment totally acquired 72 MOLLI data sets (6 participants x 4 slices x 3 repeats). The 3-3-5 scheme acquired 
11 images in each data set. We then reconstructed two T1 maps, a MOLLI-T1 map and a Ratio-T1 map using each 
data set. A MOLLI-T1-map was generated with all 11 images of each data set using the original MOLLI T1 
mapping algorithm5. A Ratio-T1-map was produced with the first three images of each data set using the proposed 
ratio-based algorithm. We manually selected 19 regions of interests (ROIs) on 4 slices, including one liver ROI, 
one ROI covering blood pool in the left ventricle (LV), 17 myocardium segments using the AHA-17 standard6. We 
then calculated the average T1 value in each ROI. This procedure generates 342 T1 values (6 participants x19 ROIs 
x 3 repeats) for each T1 reconstruction method (i.e., MOLLI and Ratio-T1).  
Results 
Figure 1 displays the linear regression between T1 values obtained using Ratio-T1 and MOLLI. The regression 
analysis reveals high correlation between two methods (slope: 1.389, bias: -227.13, r2=0.989). Figure 2 shows T1 
maps (left-column: basal, right-column: apical) calculated using Ratio-T1 (Figs. 2a and 2b), Ratio-T1 adjusted with 
the regression model (Figs. 2c and 2d), and MOLLI (Figs. 2e and 2f). Using the MOLLI T1 maps as reference 
standards, the Ratio-T1 maps shows overestimation on the T1 values whereas the adjusted Ratio-T1 maps exhibits 
visually similar to the MOLLI T1 maps. We observed that the sharpness of the LV walls in Fig.2c (Ratio-T1) is 
slightly better that in Fig.2e (MOLLI). The reason of the sharpness discrepancies may be caused by the 
differences of acquisition durations of the two methods (Ratio-T1: 3 heart beats, MOLLI: 17 heart beats).  
Discussion 
This study attempts T1 mapping using only three samples of the relaxation curves. The proposed method is fully 
compatible to the original MOLLI sequence. To validate this method we acquired all 11 images using MOLLI sequence and reconstructed T1 maps using the 
Ratio-T1 method and the MOLLI method, which allows a direct comparison of T1 values obtained using the two methods. Although the results showed T1 
overestimations when using the Ratio-T1 method, the T1 values obtained using two methods were highly correlated with good precision. The Ratio-T1 method has 
advantages when a patient fails to perform voluntary breath-hold during MOLLI image acquisition, particularly when through-plane motion precludes retrospective 
motion correction. Hence the Ratio-T1 method could be a plausible alternative without the need to modify the original MOLLI acquisition with either 5-3-3 or 5-3 
schemes. The correlation result supports the possibility of quantifying the extracellular volume2,3 (ECV) of the myocardium because ECV could be estimated using 
relative T1 values of the myocardium and the blood. A phantom study expanding the range of T1 regression analysis and patient studies to evaluate the diagnostic 
value of the Ratio-T1 method merits further studies. In conclusion, this study presented a T1 mapping algorithm requiring only the first three images acquired 
using the MOLLI sequence. It is suitable to acquire T1 maps from patients who cannot perform long voluntary breath-hold or to reconstruct MOLLI data sets with 
uncorrectable motion artifacts.

Introduction 
Dual echo in the steady state (DESS) pulse sequence, which allows simultaneous acquisitions of two echoes within one TR, has evolved as an attractive technique for 
morphological imaging and quantitative T2 mapping [1]. With its compatibility with 3D acquisition, the T2 imaging method generates images with high signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) and high spatial resolution in a relatively short imaging time. Previous study shows that the flip angle dependence of DESS signal results in the systematic 
errors when computing T2 measurements [2]. Furthermore, it is well known that the actual flip angle across a 3D slab often decreases at the slab boundaries, and that 
the uniformity of the signal profile worsens as the designated flip angle increases [3]. Accordingly, in this study, we apply 3D DESS imaging for T2 measurement 
experiments to investigate the influence of the radio-frequency (RF) excitation pulse across slices within one slab, and discuss the effects of RF slab profiles.  
 
Methods 
Phantom imaging experiments were performed on a 3.0T Siemens Trio system using a 12-channel head coil. The 
image parameters were 200 mm FOV, 64 by 64 matrix size, 32 slices per slab, 5 mm slice thickness, 260 Hz/px 
BW and TR/TE1/TE2 = 30/3/57 ms, where TE1 and TE2 are the echo time of FID-like (S+) and echo-like (S-) 
images, respectively. To examine the T2 measurement, different flip angle (FA) values (10°, 20°, 30°, 40°, 50°, 
60°, 70°, 80°, and 90°) were used. The theoretical behavior of DESS signal intensity (S+ and S-) undergoing a 
continuous train of RF pulses was simulated for the same scanning parameters as described for the imaging 
experiments. The experimental and simulated T2 values corresponding to paired S+/S- derived from varied FA was 
subsequently calculated based on equation mentioned in [1, 2]. To further examine the relationship of 3D slab, two 
kinds of sinc-shaped excitation RF pulses were applied to DESS imaging separately, one with no side lobes used 
for conventional DESS imaging (RF1) and the other with 2 side lobes for better slab profiles (RF2). The RF pulse 
was simulated according to the RF parameters, and the profile of the flip angle distribution was then estimated by 
using Fourier transformation. A multiple spin echo (SE) sequence with 2000 ms TR and 32 contrasts (range from 
16 to 512 ms, 16 ms step) was performed to determine the accurate T2 value.  
 
Results 
The ground true T2 value estimated from multiple SE is 81.34±0.80 ms. Figure 1 shows the T2 error of RF1 estimated from the comparison between DESS T2 and 
ground true value along the section direction with varied FAs (10°, 20°, 30°, 40°, 50°, 60°, 70°, 80°, and 90°), indicating that larger flip angle leads to more accurate T2 
measurement and dramatic T2 changes between slices (~30% differences between central slice and the most marginal one). On the contrary, less accurate quantification 
but better T2 consistency across slices (< 10% at FA10°) can be found for smaller flip angles. Figure 2 demonstrates the slab profiles at designated flip angle of 90°, 
where the black line, blue dotted line and blue asterisks represent the flip angle distribution, simulated T2, and estimated DESS T2 profile, respectively. All are 
normalized to the value at the slab center. Distinct patterns of flip angle distribution are presented, where the left column is the result obtained by sequence with RF1, 
and right column represents results from RF2. RF2 provides DESS T2 estimation with a wider range of consistency within central portion of slab and a substantial drop 
in the marginal slices, compared with the calculated T2 profile from RF1. Note that the 
estimated DESS T2s are in a good agreement with simulated T2 values for both 
datasets, and all T2 profiles are consistent with corresponding flip angle distribution as 
well. Figure 3 demonstrates the T2 maps of the phantom, where 6 out of 32 slices are 
chosen as example. The T2 map from the RF2 shows consistent contrast in 20 of 32 
slices within central portion of slab, while only SL14 to SL20 could be viewed as 
similar contrast for T2 map from RF1.  
 
Discussion and Conclusion 
The results from this study demonstrate that the reliability of T2 quantification using 
3D DESS could vary along the section direction due to flip angle profile imperfection, 
and could be increased by acquiring data with RF pulses having better slab profiles. 
With appropriate setting of the RF profile, the wider plateau of flip angle distribution 
as well as the DESS T2 estimations across slab could be achieved. There is some 
residual T2 underestimation on both sides of most marginal slice, which may be 
caused by inherent abrupt drop of RF property (RF2); nevertheless, the most part of 
slices could be viewed as consistent when using the modified RF pulse. It should be 
noted that, in conventional 3D DESS imaging, slices across slab have distinct 
estimated T2 values due to the corresponding flip angle distribution (RF1), which 
could impair the accuracy of comparison between slices even FA of 30° is used. We 
therefore conclude that, the modified 3D DESS technique provides benefit for better 
T2 quantitative imaging for clinical applications.

Background 
Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) helps depicting hemorrhage and veins by incorporating phase information from long echo time (TE) signals to enhance contrast 
between paramagnetic substances and brain parenchyma [1]. An alternative of SWI uses multiple echoes averaged to improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and is named 
susceptibility weighted angiography (SWAN) [2]. Since the averaging operation with signals from early echoes [3] inevitably results in a dilution of T2* weighting, it is 
anticipated that the SNR improvements and loss in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) present an obvious trade-off. In this research, an adaptive averaging scheme for 
multi-echo SWI is proposed, with weights of echoes adjusted according to the phase value of each voxel to achieve SNR improvements without sacrificing CNR.  
Materials and Methods 
Imaging data from three subjects were included. The 3D multiple gradient echo imaging (8 echoes) was conducted using a GE 1.5T MR system. The imaging 
parameters were as following: TR = 55msec, TE = 5.5 ~ 50.5msec, acquisition/ reconstruction matrix = 416×256/512×512, field of view = 240*240mm2, slice thickness 
= 2mm, flip angle = 20°, slice number = 64 ~ 76, and bandwidth = 163Hz/pixel. The magnitude images of late 5 echoes were root mean squared to generate SWAN 
images. For SWI, the phase images were homodyne high-pass filtered to create the phase mask from the sixth echo (TE=38 ms) [1], followed by multiplying the phase 
mask four times with its corresponding magnitude image. For adaptive averaging, the magnitude images of the 5 late echoes were multiplied by the same phase mask 
four times as in SWI, and then averaged using the weighting function 0.5)/(-(-0.5)TE)/(-W ijiij +×+×= πθπθ , where Wij is the weighting value at the ith voxel for 
the jth echo and θ is the phase value. Using this weight adjustment, voxels with more positive (diamagnetic brain parenchyma) and negative phase (hemorrhage or veins) 
was given more weighting on early and late echoes, respectively. Hence it improves SNR and maintains the susceptibility-related darkening effect. 
Quantitative comparison of the three methods was made on minimum intensity projection (miP) of 7 slices because of its wide popularity in clinical diagnosis. For this 
purpose, the internal cerebral veins of both hemispheres and the neighboring white matter were selected as the target and reference region-of-interest (ROI), respectively. 
Standard deviations of signal intensity from bilateral homogeneous white matters of the parietal lobe were taken as the noise. The ratio between mean signal of reference 
ROI and the noise was taken as SNR, whereas the mean signal difference between target and reference ROIs divided by the noise was given as CNR. Conspicuity of the 
veins was further evaluated by plotting the signal profile (Fig.1) crossing the internal cerebral veins (line segments in Fig.2). The venous depth was defined as the signal 
difference between mean signal of pixels along line a and d and mean signal of pixels at valleys b and c (Fig.1). The venous width was defined by mean full width half 
maximum of pixels at valleys b and c (Fig.1). All three methods were evaluated for SNR, CNR, depth, and width for all subjects.     
Results 
The mIP images with adaptive averaging from one subject demonstrate higher vein-parenchyma CNR than SWAN and better SNR than SWI (Fig. 2a-c). The 1D signal 
profile of the bilateral cerebral veins from the image obtained using the proposed method is deeper and sharper than those with other two methods (Fig.2d). Quantitative 
analysis for the adaptive averaging method yields SNR/CNR/depth/width =104±15/ 47.8±16.6/ 587.0±78.8/ 2.7±0.6 pixels (Table 1), suitable for venous depiction.  
Discussions 
The adaptive averaging method benefits from the utilization of phase information as in SWI to provide the desired susceptibility contrast, at the same time improves the 
SNR of the surrounding brain parenchyma via signal averaging with the early echoes as in SWAN. Better visualization of the venous structure is thus obtained with the 
proposed approach. The weighting algorithm aiming at signal averaging only for the parenchyma can be further optimized depending on the target ROI.

 Introduction 
The human meniscus consists primarily of collagen fibers that contribute to important mechanical functions of the knee, such as load distribution, but is also 
strongly correlated with the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) [1]. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the ability of ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence 
to target the rapid decay signal from the meniscus due to short T2 of the water in this highly collagenous structure [2]. Although our previous report indicated that 
3D radial sequence with minimal phase excitation pulse is helpful in demonstration of in vivo meniscal architecture [3], relative long acquisition time restricts its 
clinical application. On the other hand, T2* relaxation time could reflect spin-spin interactions of protons bound to collagen and the degree of collagen fibril 
alignment [4]. Although UTE-T2* mapping has been used to target the short T2 components with increased sensitivity, Williams et al indicated that a UTE is not 
absolutely required to study meniscus T2* relaxation due to only low percentages of asymptomatic menisci showing T2* values less than 6.2 ms [5]. As a result, 
the purpose of this study is to design a 2D multi-slice dual echo radial sequence with a minimal phase excitation pulse for facilitating visualization of the fiber 
orientation in human meniscus based on quantitative T2* mapping. 
 
Methods 
To make sure the efficiency of the designed radial imaging sequence for yielding signal of the short T2 component, a phantom study was performed before in vivo 
human meniscus imaging. A combination of eraser array, water bottle and oil bottle was used to mimic the short T2 components of human meniscus and its 
surrounding tissues. After quality assurance of the phantom images, six asymptomatic volunteers (4 men and 2 women, aged from 25 to 32) without any known or 
suspected knee pathology were imaged in supine position at 3T MR system (TIM TRIO, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) with an eight-channel 
knee coil. More specifically, the 2D duel echo radial imaging method were repeated 4 times with 8 different echo times 0.82/2/3/4/6.95/8.13/9.13/10.13 ms, flip 
angle = 600, TR = 700ms, number of slice = 8, slice thickness = 5mm, projection number = 512, readout per projection = 512, in-plane resolution = 0.24×0.24 mm2, 
acquisition time per repeat = 5 min 58 sec. 
  
Results 
The designed pulse sequence diagram is illustrated in Fig. 1. Results of the phantom study are shown in Fig. 2, in which images acquired before and after 
correction of ADC phase error as well as gradient delay are shown, respectively. Image homogeneity was significantly improved by the latter. Moreover, a sagittal 
image acquired from one of the subjects using the optimized radial imaging with a minimal phase excitation pulse and the derived T2* map are displayed in Fig. 3. 
The obtained image shows adequate signal from human menisci including both short T2 and long T2 components. In addition, the contrast between them is 
enhanced in the corresponding T2* map image, in which fibers with longer T2* relaxation time mainly running from the peripheral zone into the inner zone of 
meniscus. The T2* values of the menisci range from 4 to 8 ms, that is consistent with the previous report. 
 
Discussion 
The study illustrates the feasibility of combining 2D radial sampling with minimal phase excitation pulse to obtain adequate signal and achieve improved image 
quality for enhanced visualization of the fiber architecture in the human meniscus. The radial acquisition method provides a means to obtain high SNR from a 
substantially reduced echo acquisition time as well as dense sampling around the center of k-space, which allows calculating T2* map of in vivo human meniscus 
with higher accuracy. Our study also indicates the demonstration of the enhanced visualization of fiber orientation in T2* map than in the original images. To 
minimize artifacts caused by imperfect gradient performance, no ramp sampling was used in this study. In conclusion, our preliminary findings demonstrate that 
the proposed method allows enhanced visualization of structural details of the human meniscus, revealing the spatial T2* distribution and fiber orientation and may 
provide opportunities for diagnosing early degenerative changes for possible intervention.

Simultaneous relaxometry and susceptibility imaging in the brain

Target Audience: Researchers interested in exploiting susceptibility imaging and relaxometry (T2 and T2*) to detect and characterize disease states. 
 
Purpose: Brain iron concentration and iron accumulation are of vast clinical interest for they may be related to brain diseases such as Parkinson’s 
disease, Alzheimer’s diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Iron content can be characterized through either susceptibility or relaxation rate measurements 
[1-3]. A novel imaging method is presented here that enables susceptibility imaging, T2 and T2
* mapping to be performed from a single rapid scan. 
 
Theory: As in the ‘dual echo steady-state’ (DESS) sequence, two different types of signals 
are sampled during readout: an FID-like (S+) and a spin echo-like (S-) signal. Both signals 
are sampled at a few different TE locations, leading to a dual-pathway multi-echo sequence 
similar to the GESFIDE [4] sequence. A main development here involves generating 
quantitative T2 and T2
* maps from the resulting images. The relaxation of the sampled 
magnetization is described as: 
 
 
where R2 and R2′ represent irreversible and reversible decay, respectively, such that T2 = 
1/R2 and T2
* = 1/(R2+R2′). Because the S
- signal is similar to a spin-echo on its way to 
formation, reversible decay is in the process of being corrected and results in the (R2 - R2′) 
factor in the second term of Eq. 2. In contrast, (R2 + R2′) appears in Eq. 1, allowing the two 
variables to be separated and quantitative T2 and T2
* values to be calculated. 
While Eqs. 1 and 2 involve the magnitude of S+ and S- and can be used for T2 and T2
* 
mapping, the phase of S+ and S- proves to be very-well suited for susceptibility imaging [5]. 
Because the S- signal is rephasing towards an echo rather than dephasing away from 
excitation, it essentially doubles the range of TE values available for field mapping 
compared to a regular GRE sequence (by allowing both negative and positive TE values). 
For this reason, having both S+ and S- signals may have SNR advantages in the resulting 
field map and susceptibility-weighted images. Both signal intensity (S.I.) and phase 
evolutions are illustrated in Fig. 1. 
 
Materials and Methods: Simulations were performed to optimize the scanning parameters 
(e.g., Fig. 2a). Assuming T1/T2/T2
* = 1500/100/60 ms, TR and flip angle values were found 
that maximized the SNR efficiency in the calculated field maps, and values of TR = 50 ms 
and flip angle = 25 degrees were selected here. Four healthy volunteers were imaged 
(Siemens Trio, 3 T, 32-ch head matrix), with informed consent from an IRB-approved 
protocol. As shown in Fig. 1, four different echo times were sampled (TE = 7.1, 19.0, 31.0, 
and 42.9 ms, bandwidth = 110 Hz/px, matrix size = 192x192x36, voxel size = 1x1x2 mm3, 
total scan time = 5:47). For field mapping, BET and PRELUDE (FSL, Oxford, UK) [6] were 
used for brain extraction and phase unwrapping, and a spherical mean value method [7] was 
adopted to filter out external field perturbations. Using the signal magnitude, Eqs. 1 and 2 
were solved for R2 and R2′. Six regions (white matter, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus 
pallidus, red nucleus, and substantia nigra) were contoured to evaluate the T2 and T2
* results. 
 
Results and Discussion: Results for the internal field Bint, R2 and R2*= R2 + R2′ are shown 
in Fig. 2 (b-d). The measured R2 and R2
* values are listed in Table 1 for various brain 
structures, along with the corresponding T2 and T2
* values. The measurements in Table 1 are 
in good agreement with findings from previous studies [8, 9]. In a scan time of less than 6 
minutes, the proposed approach proved capable of generating good quality Bint, T2 and T2
* 
measurements over a 192x192x36 3D volume. These measurements are expected to prove 
useful in the detection and quantification of iron content, a condition that has been linked 
with research-intensive conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s diseases and 
multiple sclerosis. Scan time could be further reduced by including parallel imaging. 
 
Conclusion: The proposed method is capable of simultaneously measuring R2, R2′ and the 
internal field perturbation from a single rapid scan.
