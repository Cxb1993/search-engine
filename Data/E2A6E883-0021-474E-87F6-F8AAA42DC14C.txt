the impinging jets are produced and directed toward the heated surface. In the channel with two opposite 
walls roughened by inclined perforated baffles [11], the averaged Nusselt numbers for turbulent flows were 
raised to the levels about 2-5 times of the Dittus-Boelter references. However, in despite of its drawbacks 
for structure integrities and manufacturing difficulties, the HTE performances for perforated baffles under 
fouling conditions can be significantly impaired if the orifices through the perforated baffles are blocked to 
prohibit jet impingements.  
 
Twisted tapes in ducts provide considerable HTE effects with reasonable pressure drop penalty which are 
also suitable for retrofit applications. Longitudinal swirls and the modification of near wall velocity profile 
due to the various vorticity distributions in the vortex core are two major attributes for THE effects. 
Additional HTE mechanisms for twisted tape inserts include the partitioning and partial blockage of ducted 
flow, fin effects and the elongated twisted flow path [13-16]. Impacts of such HTE measure remain very 
effective for laminar flows but fall dramatically for turbulent flows as the lateral fluid mixings promoted by 
twisted tapes are well preserved in turbulent structures. HTE ratios in tubes with twisted tape inserts could 
be respectively raised to 30 and 3.5 times of the plain tube levels for laminar and turbulent flows [14]. 
Winglet-type longitudinal vortex generators [17-18] offer considerable heat transfer elevations with 
significant pressure losses in channels. The longitudinal vortices are generated along the side edges of 
vortex generators (VG) due to flow separations at leading edges of VG as a result of pressure differences 
between the upstream and downstream sides of each VG. These VG-induced vortices swirl the bulk flow 
that promote fluid mixings close to and far from the channel walls that generates considerable heat transfer 
augmentations [17]. But the large cost of pressure loss in VG channel prevents its wide applications and has 
led to an alternative approach by fitting VG on one wall with the rib floor on the opposite wall [18]. HTE 
ratios of a VG channel from the smooth-walled references are in the ranges of 2.9-3.41 for turbulent flows 
[18]. In view of preserving the structural stiffness and integrity of a coolant channel, the scale-roughened 
surface is proposed [19]. A large amount of deepened scales over the roughened wall breaks the boundary 
layers and promotes turbulence activities. Localized vortical flow cells are triggered when the bulk flow 
traverses each scale either from the forward or backward direction. Nusselt number ratios (Nu/Nu∞) for 
laminar forward and backward flows in the scale-roughened channel of H/W=1/8 were in the range of 
7.4-9.2 and 6.2-7.4 respectively. Turbulent heat transfer rates in the scale-roughened narrow channel were 
about 4.5 and 3 times of the Dittus-Boelter levels for the forward and backward flows respectively [19]. 
 
The on-going search for better heat transfer performances is continued by combining different HTE 
elements into a compound HTE device. The so called compound enhancement generally offers the higher 
HTE ratio than the individual techniques applied separately. Research goals in this respect involve the 
further elevations of HTE ratio and thermal performance factor with the extended effective Re range. 
Typical examples of such compound HTE measures for channel flows include the combination of twisted 
tape and corrugated tube [21] and the serrated twisted tape [22]. The corrugated tube with twisted tape insert 
could elevate Nusselt numbers to 1.9-9.6 times of the plain tube value in the Re range of 4000-60000 [21].

The two opposite wide walls of test channel fitted with the compound V-ribs and scaled surfaces were 
machined from two stainless steel plates with the thermal conductivity of 15 Wm

 and electrically 
heated by two 0.5mm thick Minco thermal foils. Each heating foil was sandwiched between a 25mm thick 
Teflon plate and the roughened heat transfer surface which generated the basically uniform heat flux heating 
condition. The Minco thermal foil is attached to the back flat surface of each roughened steel plate by the 
forces generated from a series of axial bolts along the test channel. Because the ribs and scales are machined 
from the same stainless steel material of high conductivity, the Nu data generated by the present study 
represents the average Nusselt number at each axial location. As indicated in Fig. 1-b, twelve K-type 
thermocouples with equal interval were installed on the back face of along the centerline the roughened 
surface for wall-temperature measurements. These thermocouple locations for Tw measurements 
corresponded to the rib and mid-rib locations. All the temperature measurements were monitored and stored 
in a PC using through the data logger for the subsequent data processing. Wall temperature measurements at 
all the axial locations were corrected into the base-line surface as indicated in Fig. 1-b using the one 
dimensional heat conduction equation. The origins of streamwise (x) and spanwise (y) coordinate systems 
for the forward and backward flows were selected at the middle span of each entry edge. Thermal insulation 
material was wrapped over the outer surface of the test channel to minimize the external heat loss. Via the 
heat loss calibration tests, it was found that the external-heat loss over the heat transfer surface increased 
with the increase of wall-to-ambient temperature difference. As the wall temperatures over the roughened 
surface were not uniformly distributed, local heat loss fluxes varied spatially. With a uniform heat flux 
supplied from the Minco thermal foil, the convective heat flux over the heat transfer surface was not 
perfectly uniform. Axial distributions of convective heat flux were obtained by subtracting the local heat 
loss flux from the total heat flux supplied. A review for the entire data of convective heat flux revealed that 
the non-uniformities in heat flux distributions were less than 9.1 % due to the small amount of external heat

The symbols of ρ, Wm, d and μ in equation (1) are the fluid density, bulk mean flow velocity, 
hydraulic-diameter of test channel and viscosity of fluid respectively. The local convective heat flux (q) in 
equation (2) was obtained by subtracting the local heat loss flux from the supplied heat flux over the 
electrical heating foil. The heating surface adopted to evaluate the supplied and lost heat fluxes included all 
profiles of the V-ribs and scales. Having determined the local convective heat flux, the local Nusselt number 
(Nu) was defined using equation (1). All the fluid properties appeared in equations (1) and (2) were 
evaluated from the local flow bulk temperature, Tb.  
 
Dimensionless pressure drops over the test channel were evaluated as the Fanning friction factors (Cf) using 
the pressure drops (ΔP) across the test channel of length L with mean flow velocity (Wm) as:

Uncertainties of temperature measurements were the major sources to attribute the uncertainties of coolant’s 
thermal conductivity, fluid density and viscosity. The maximum uncertainties associated with Nu and Re and 
Cf were respectively estimated as 10.2% and 4.8 % and 2.1% following the policy of ASME on reporting 
the uncertainties in experimental measurements and results [23]. 
 
References to assess HTE ratios and pressure-drop augmentations in the present test channel were selected

3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Heat transfer measurements and correlations 
Figure 2 compares the axial Nu distributions along the centerline of roughened heat transfer surface at each 
Re tested between forward and backward flows. The axial Nu profiles follow a general trend of exponential 
decay subject to minor zig-zag Nu variations triggered by V-ribs. The abrupt entrance of present test channel 
generates developing flows in the axial spans about 0<x/d<1.58 and 0<x/d<2.72 for forward and backward

transfer surface. Activities of vortical flows are enhanced by these deepened circular scales that augment 
vorticity and turbulence levels with the increased friction-loss penalty. Strong cross-stream secondary flows 
are simultaneously induced by the protruding V-ribs that sweep the highly turbulent vortical cells from these 
deepened scales toward the channel core for heat exchanges via furious fluid mixings. These compound 
mechanisms of boundary layer breaking, enhancements of turbulent and vortical activities and the strong 
cross-stream secondary flows induced by V-ribs simultaneously interact to generate significant heat transfer 
augmentations. This is demonstrated in each plot of Fig. 2 by comparing the present heat transfer levels with 
the Nu∞ references. Turbulent Nusselt numbers in the developed flow regimes at Reynolds number of 30000 
are elevated to the levels about 6.8 and 6.3 times of the Nu∞ references for forward and backward flows 
respectively, which offer the very high HTE ratios for turbulent flows. 
 
A common setback for a variety of HTE devices to augment turbulent heat transfer is the decreased HTE 
ratios as Re increases. The complex flow structures generated in the test channel fitted with the present HTE 
surfaces involve the enhanced turbulence intensities and the furious vortical mixings due to the presence of 
surface scales. These scale-triggered flow phenomena tend to be augmented by increasing Re which 
consequently enhances the dependency of Nu on Re. Such weighted Re impact on Nu extends the effective 
Re range for HTE. This has been demonstrated by our previous study that showed the local Nusselt numbers 
in a channel fitted with scaled roughness were respectively correlated by Re
0.815
 and Re
0.7
 for forward and 
backward flows so that the effective Re range for turbulent heat transfer augmentations were considerably 
extended [19]. For the present test channel, heat transfer results in the developed flow regime are analyzed 
to reveal the functional relationship between Nusselt and Reynolds numbers through which the heat transfer 
correlations for the forward and backward flows are also revealed. Initially, the Nusselt number value of 
developed flow in the present test channel ( Nu ) is obtained by averaging the local Nu data collected at all 
the mid-rib locations in the developed flow region. Fig. 3 depicts the varying manners of Nu  versus Re for 
forward and backward flows. The referenced Nusselt numbers (Nu∞) for laminar and turbulent flows over 
the tested Re range are included in Fig. 3 for comparisons. Two sets of Nu  data trends shown in Fig. 3 are 
well correlated by equations (9) and (10) for the forward and backward flows respectively. 
Nu  = 0.157 × Re
0.787
 (forward flow)           (9) 
Nu  = 0.49 × Re
0.649
 (backward flow)          (10) 
In the range of 1000<Re<30000, 96% of the present experimental Nusselt numbers ( Nu ) agree within +10% 
discrepancies from the predictions of equations (9) and (10). As the Prandtl number effects are absorbed into 
the coefficients of equations (9) and (10), which are not included as a parametric effect when these 
correlations are developed, equations (9) and (10) are essentially limited to dry air. It is interesting to note in 
Figs. 2 and 3 that the heat transfer differences between the forward and backward flow conditions increase 
as Re increases. This particular result indicates that the flow interactions triggered by V-ribs and scales are 
different between the forward and backward flows. The deepened scales possibly disturb the secondary 
flows induced by V-ribs in case of backward flow so that the differences in compound heat transfer 
augmentations between forward and backward flows systematically increase as Re increases.

Augmentations of friction factor from the smooth-walled tube levels for the present compound HTE 
roughness are indexed by the Cf /Cf∞ ratios. Fig. 5(b) plots the variations of Cf /Cf∞ ratio against Re for 
forward and backward flows in which the Cf /Cf∞ data reported for varieties of single and compound HTE 
measures are included for comparison. The Cf /Cf∞ ratios for the present test channel and the scaled 
roughened channel of H/W=1/8 [19] are among the highest magnitudes between the comparative groups 
collected in Fig. 5(b). In the present test channel of aspect ratio (H/W)=1/2, the compound surface 
roughness that consolidates protruding V-ribs and deepened scales constantly exhibits the higher Cf /Cf∞ 
ratios than those counterparts in the scale roughened channel of H/W=1/8 due to the additional pressure 
drops induced by V-ribs. Ratios of Cf /Cf∞ for the present forward and backward flows also decrease with 
the increase of Re which fall respectively in the ranges of 32.4-16.8 and 46.7-27.7. The significant HTE 
impacts observed in Fig. 4 for the present test channel are accompanying with the high pressure drop 
penalty. This result has led to the requirement for comparing the thermal performance factors (η) between 
varieties of HTE measures. But for the engineering applications that request very high HTE effects with the 
Nu levels about 6 times of Nu∞, the high pressure drops incurred by the present compound HTE roughness 
must be compensated. 
 
3.3 Thermal performance factors 
Fig. 6 shows the comparison of thermal performance factors of present compound THE device with 
varieties of single and compound HTE measures. It is a common trend that the thermal performance factors 
(η) decrease as Re increases for turbulent flows. The descending rates of η versus Re curves vary with the 
HTE measures adopted. In general, the ribbed channel, twisted-tape insert and inclined perforated baffle 
exhibit the faster descending rates of η curves as shown in Fig. 6 so that the thermal performances with 
cooling applications involving high Reynolds numbers are deteriorated for these types of HTE measures. 
But the present compound HTE device and the scale-roughened channel [19] offer the relatively steady 
thermal performances as Re increases. These favorable data trends are attributed from the steady 
performance of HTE impacts for turbulent flows as demonstrated in Fig. 4. With laminar flows, the thermal 
performance factors in present test channel and the scale-roughened channel [19] increase as Re increases. 
This particular data trend reverses the typical results found in the rib-roughened channels and demonstrates 
the superiority of present compound HTE roughness in thermal performances for laminar flows. With 
Re<3000, thermal performance factors for the present forward and backward flows are considerably higher 
than the comparative groups shown in Fig. 6. Once again, the thermal performance factors for the present 
compound HTE roughness with forward turbulent flows score the highest values among the various single 
and compound HTE measures compared in Fig. 6. Even for the backward flows with Re>20000, the η 
values are higher than those developed in the channel fitted with discrete ribs. In view of the comparative 
results depicted in Figs. 4 and 6, the present compound HTE roughness with forward flows simultaneously 
offer the highest values of Nu /Nu∞ and η that is suitable for cooling applications of gas turbine blades for

secondary flows. Even with the agitated rib-flows in the rotating ribbed channels, the turbulence 
activities are promoted and suppressed over the unstable and stable walls respectively [25]. But 
rotating buoyancy effects are considerably suppressed from the scenarios found in the smooth-walled 
rotating channel due to the presence of surface ribs [26]. 
 
In the channel roughened by deepened dimples, the flow structures over the dimpled surface are 
characterized by vortex pairs those periodically shed from each dimple [19]. Local heat transfer 
enhancements are more pronounced near the downstream rim of each dimple. Averaged Nusselt 
numbers in a non-rotating dimpled channel fall between 1.85 and 2.89 times of the smooth walled 
channel [19]. Unlike the secondary flows induced by angled ribs, the strong and continuous vortical 
cells can not be established over the cross-section of a dimpled channel at the non-rotating condition. 
Vortical interactions between the Coriolis vortices and the rib-flows are absent in the rotating 
dimpled channel; but the Coriolis secondary flows sweep away the three-dimensional vortices 
triggered by dimples; and turbulences are promoted and suppressed over the unstable and stable 
walls respectively. These Coriolis effects produce typical heat transfer enhancements and 
impediments over the unstable and stable dimpled walls. Local Nusselt numbers over the unstable 
and stable walls are respectively increased and reduced to the levels about 2.2-3.4 and 1.2-1.7 times 
of Nu∞ references at the parametric conditions of 0.01<Ro<0.3 [9].  
 
Channels fitted with pin-fin array are widely adopted as a part of cooling network at the trailing edge 
of a rotor blade where the higher HTE effectiveness is required. Two primary vortex pairs 
downstream of each pin row, as the remnants of the two legs of horseshoe vortices, are formed by the 
blockage and streamline displacement effects. Even with the adiabatic pin-fin array that rules out the 
additional fin effects, the HTE ratios for a non-rotating pin-fin channel fall in the range of 2-4 times 
of Nu∞ [6, 22-23]. When the pin-fin channel rotates, the pin-fin array that penetrates across the 
rotating channel considerably disturbs the development of cross-sectional Coriolis secondary flows. 
The typical vortical flow structures dominated by the downstream convection of the Coriolis 
secondary flows, as those developed in the rotating ribbed and dimpled channels are unlikely 
followed by the rotating pin-fin channel. But the mechanisms of flow instability due to the spanwise 
pressure gradients induced by Coriolis forces still prevail over the rotating pin-fin channel that 
interact with the disturbed Coriolis vortices to generate the peripheral heat transfer variations. Heat 
transfer levels over the stable and unstable walls of a rotating pin-fin channel are respectively raised 
and reduced to about 1.2-1.4 and 0.7-0.75 times of the non-rotating levels with 0.1<Ro<0.2 [6]. Due 
to the limited heat transfer data available in the literature [6], the impacts of rotating buoyancy on 
heat transfer for the rotating pin-fin channel are not yet clear. 
 
Figure 1 summarizes heat transfer measurements in the rotating ribbed, dimpled and pin-fin channels 
on the (a) stable and (b) unstable walls in the form of Nu/Nu∞ versus Ro. Along the stable wall (see

for the present test channel roughened by the compound V-ribs and deepened scales are indicated in 
Fig. 1. This series of rotating tests follows our previous work [27] in which the characteristics of heat 
transfer, pressure drop and thermal performances for the compound roughness of deepened scales 
and V-ribs in a rectangular channel with forward and downward flows were reported. But no 
previous study has examined the heat transfer performances for a rectangular channel roughened by 
such compound surface under the rotating conditions. This experimental study performs local heat 
transfer measurements along the centerlines of two roughened walls of a rotating rectangular channel 
with Ro and Bu considerably extended from the past experiences. The parametric analysis of heat 
transfer phenomena in association with the individual and interdependent effects of Re, Ro and Bu 
are illustrated along with the development of empirical heat transfer correlations. This set of heat 
transfer correlations accounts for the local heat transfer data generated by the present study that can 
uncouples the individual but mutually interdependent Ro and Bu effects on heat transfer. 
 
2. Experimental details 
2.1 Dimensionless parameters for heat transfer experiments 
 
The technical community of experimental heat transfer for rotating channels has agreed that the 
Reynolds (Re) and rotation (Ro) numbers characterize the forced convection and the Coriolis forces 
in their own rights with the impacts of rotating buoyancy to be indexed by buoyancy number (Bu). 
The combination of density ratio (Δρ/ρ) in terms of β(Tw-Tb) with the relative centrifuge forms the 
non-dimensional group of β(Tw-Tb)Ro
2
(R/d) that is referred to as the buoyancy number (Bu) which 
physically reflects the relative strength of rotating buoyancy force. As a preliminary study to explore 
the heat transfer performances of the compound HTE measures using the deepened scales and V-ribs 
as an initial attempt, this experimental study examines the parametric variations of heat transfer 
performances in association with the relevant controlling dimensionless parameters. Variations of 
any governing dimensionless parameter such as Re, Ro, Pr or Bu for a set of pre-defined geometric 
and heating conditions result in different heat transfer performances. The heat transfer variation 
attributed from the systematic change of each of the governing flow parameters signifies the 
individual impacts of this varying parameter. Within the present tested Tb range of 302-326 K, the 
maximum variation in Prandtl number (Pr) of the tested coolant is negligible about 1.4%. Therefore 
the present parametric study is attempted to reveal the functional relationships between local Nusselt 
number (Nu) and the controlling dimensionless parameters in the form of 
 
Nu =  {Re, Ro, Bu, X, geometric and thermal boundary conditions}.  (1) 
 
The unknown functional structure  is to be discovered through this parametric study. The 
experimentally defined Nusselt number (Nu) is calculated as

2.2 Experimental program 
 
This experimental study has three phases. Initially the static duct flow conditions are examined to 
generate the database against which the heat transfer results detected from the rotating channel are 
compared. Relative heat transfer enhancements from the Dittus-Boelter levels are determined and 
compared with the typical results collected from the static ribbed, dimpled and pin-fin channels. The 
second phase of study conducts a series of rotating experiments at the parametric conditions 
summarized in Table 1. Each set of rotating data generated in the second phase is produced at fixed 
Re and Ro by adjusting the rotational speed and the pressure level of test channel. At each selected 
Re-Ro combination, four ascending heater powers that raise the highest Tw levels to 353, 373, 393, 
and 403 K are supplied to reach four different steady state conditions. This measure adjusts the level 
of rotating buoyancy at fixed Re and Ro and generates a series of Nu data to reflect the isolated Bu 
effect on heat transfer. But such adjustments of heat flux vary fluid bulk temperatures that 
accordingly vary the fluid properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity of the test coolant. In 
order to control Re and Ro at the flow entrance of test section within the maximum deviations of 
+1% from the targeting values, the mass flow rates of test coolant are frequently adjusted to 
compensate the changes of fluid properties due to temperature variations. 
 
The present study performs steady state heat transfer measurements. The steady state condition is 
assumed when the temporal wall temperature variations after several successive scans are less than 
+0.3
0
C after either the flow rate, rotational speed or the heating power is adjusted. Time intervals 
between such successive scans for checking the steady state are about 1 minute. Generally, the flow 
and heater power are kept for about 45 minutes in order to satisfy the steady state condition. All the 
relevant steady state measurements are processed into the dimensionless groups defined in equation 
(1) with the fluid properties determined from the local fluid bulk temperature.

module mounted on the platform of the rotating rig, the midspan eccentricity (R) is 350 mm. The 
maximum t rotational speed of heat transfer test channel is up to 650rev/min for this set of 
experiments. The test coolant flow (pressurized airflow) is supplied by two screw-type compressors 
from an air tank that is channeled through a set of pressure regulator and filter, a pressure transducer, 
a mass flow meter and a needle valve that controls the mass flow rate of airflow feeding into the heat 
transfer test module. Prior to entering the rotating test rig, the coolant is dehumidified and cooled to 
the ambient temperature. 
 
Figure 2 depicts the heat transfer test section that shows the assembly of test module (1-a) and the 
geometrical details of the compound V-ribs and deepened scales (1-b). As shown in Fig. 2-a, the 
rectangular test channel is made up of leading (1) and trailing (2) heated walls, together with two 
adiabatic tufnol sidewalls (3)(4). The leading or trailing roughened wall (1)(2) is made of the 
stainless steel plate of dimensions 80×40×240 mm and electrically heated by a 0.5 mm thick Minco 
thermal foil (5)(6) sandwiched between the tufnol bottom plates (7)(8) and the tufnol sidewalls (3)(4). 
Two basically uniform heat flux heating surfaces are simulated over the roughened leading and 
trailing walls (1)(2). Each heating foil (5) or (6) gives the active heating length of 240 mm. Electrical 
heating powers for these heating foils are supplied via a Variac transformer with the total power 
consumption metered by a Wattmeter. At each Re-Ro test condition, the heating powers are 
constantly adjusted in order to reach the pre-set Tw levels and vary the relative strength of buoyancy 
level.  
 
Two pairs of opposite roughened walls (1)(2) and smooth sidewalls (3)(4) are physically tightened 
together by means of a series of axial bolts to form the rectangular test channel with the hydraulic 
diameter (d) of 30 mm. The complete set of test section is secured between the end and top flanges 
(9)(10) by four draw-bolts. A needle valve (11) is fitted on the convergent exit flow passage to adjust 
the pressure level inside the rotating channel. Air leakage from each jointed surface is prevented by 
means of a series of 'O' ring seals and high temperature sealants. A cylindrical shield (12) is fitted 
between the end and top flanges with thermally insulated fiber filled to minimize the external heat 
loss. The heat transfer test module is vertically mounted onto the rotating platform with the dynamic 
balance ensured. 
 
In front of the roughened test section, several layers of fine mesh (13) are installed inside the entry 
plenum chamber (14). Such abrupt flow entrance for the rectangular with the abrupt area ratio of 3 
triggers the simultaneous development of thermal and hydrodynamic boundary layers at the 
immediate flow entrance. The entry air temperature is measured by a type K thermocouple (15) 
penetrating into the entry plenum chamber. Fluid properties used to evaluate Re and Ro at the flow 
entrance is based on this measured air inlet temperatures. At the exit plane of the rotating rectangular 
channel, three type K thermocouples (16) are positioned along the midline at three different spanwise

conduction equation. The prescribed local heat flux used to correct the wall temperatures to the 
locations on the solid-fluid interface is the convective heat flux (q) quoted in equation (2). The origin 
of streamwise (x) and spanwise (y) coordinates is selected at the middle span of the test-section 
entrance. The x-wise direction is in the radially outward direction with the coolant flow initially 
traverses the protruding rims of scales, which is referred to as the forward flow condition [23]. As 
our previous study [23] reveals that the forward flow offers the higher HTE ratios with the better 
thermal performance factor in the rectangular channel roughened by deepened scales, the forward 
flow configuration as well as the radially outward flow condition is adopted by the present study.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 Heat transfer measurements in static channel 
 
Figure 3-a depicts the axial distributions of HTE effectiveness in terms of Nu0/Nu∞ along the 
centerlines of the roughened leading and trailing walls at Re = 10000 and 24000. In the test channel 
with zero rotation, each pair of Nu0 measurements along two opposite leading and trailing centerlines 
does not exhibit significant differences but only reflect the minor differences between the rib and 
mid-rib locations due to the staggered arrangement of V-ribs on two opposite roughened walls. The 
axial heat transfer profiles along the leading or trailing centerline as shown in Fig. 3-a follow a 
general trend of exponential decay toward the developed levels subject to minor zig-zag variations 
triggered by V-ribs. The abrupt entrance generates the developing flow region in the axial span about 
0<x/d<1.58 where the overall heat transfer levels decay exponentially in the axial direction. The 
so-called periodically developed flow region emerges after the flow traversing about five pairs of 
V-ribs. Between each rib pitch on the leading or trailing roughened wall, local heat transfer rates are 
promoted by the deepened scales when the coolant flow traverses these scales. Due to such 
scale-induced regional heat transfer elevations over the area between two successive ribs, the 
amplitudes of zig-zag oscillations in the developed flow region are moderated from the results 
obtained with the smooth floor between two successive ribs as reported in [14,15,18].  
 
Three sets of rib-wise heat transfer measurements along the mid-pitch centerlines in the periodically 
developed flow region of leading and trailing walls at Re = 10000, 15000, 20000 and 24000 are 
collected in Fig. 3-b to indicate the rib-wise heat transfer variations in the static channel. As the 
V-ribs are pointed downstream, the rib-wise coolant stream flows from two edges of each roughened 
wall toward the mid-span apex of each V-rib. With the basically uniform heat flux condition, the wall 
temperatures increase in the rib-wise direction along the mid-rib centerline from two edges of each 
roughened wall toward the apex of V-rib. As a result, each Nu0/Nu∞ ratio at the central span location 
over leading or trailing wall is consistently lower than its two side counterparts along the mid-rib 
centerline (see Fig. 3-b). The Nu0/Nu∞ ratios at the two side mid-rib locations share with the same 
NSC 96-2221-E-022-015-MY3

performance is developed here. As the 0Nu  values reflect the same flow features at the leading and 
trailing surfaces in the periodically developed flow region for the static channel, the 0Nu  data at the 
mid-rib location is obtained by averaging the relevant Nu0 data collected from the leading and 
trailing walls. Fig. 4 displays the varying manners of 0Nu  versus Re. The Dittus-Boelter references 
over the tested Re range are also included in Fig. 4 for comparisons. The set of 0Nu  data trend 
revealed in Fig. 4 is well correlated by equation (3) to feature the averaged mid-rib heat transfer 
performances in the periodically developed flow region of static channel at the forward flow 
condition. 
 
0Nu  = 0.165 × Re
0.771
            (3) 
In the range of 10000<Re<24000, all the present 0Nu  measurements agree within +3% 
discrepancies from the predictions of equation (3). It is noticed that the Pr effects are absorbed into 
the coefficient of equation (3), which are not included as a parametric effect when equation (3) is 
developed. Therefore equation (3) is essentially limited to dry air and used as the non-rotating heat 
transfer references to assess the influences of rotation on heat transfer. In this heat transfer 
correlation (equation 3), the Re exponent of 0.771 is lower than but close to 0.8 in the Dittus-Boelter 
correlation. Hence the HTE effectiveness in terms of 0Nu /Nu∞ ratio in the present test channel 
decreases as Re increases; but is a very weak function of Re. Therefore the Re range offering the 
effective HTE ratio is extended by using the present compound roughness.  
 
3.2 General rotational heat transfer results 
 
In the present test channel, the cross-stream Coriolis secondary flows can be generated throughout 
the entire rotating channel. Unlike the rotating pin-fin channel in which the Coriolis secondary flows 
can not be well established throughout the entire channel, the interactions of the vortical flows 
between Coriolis secondary flows and the vortices tripped by V-ribs and scales play a dominant role 
to signify the rotational effects on heat transfer. The Coriolis secondary flows convect the cooler 
fluids from the duct-core toward the trailing wall with the heated confluent flows jointed on the 
leading surface to preserve the mass continuity. This flow feature is referred to as the Coriolis 
washing effect that interacts with the vortices induced by V-ribs and scales to create the complex of 
vortical structures in the present rotating channel and result in peripheral heat transfer variations. In 
NSC 96-2221-E-022-015-MY3

channel are showed in Fig. 5-b. Although the rib-induced secondary flows are orthogonal to the 
Coriolis secondary flows over the cross-sectional plane of the present rotating channel, the pattern of 
rib-wise heat transfer variations over the leading or trailing surface follows those found in the static 
channel as indicated in Fig. 3-b. The symmetrically spanwise Nu0/Nu∞ variations as shown in Fig. 
3-b reflect the symmetrical secondary flow cells in respect to the leading or trailing centerline of the 
rotating channel. As Ro increases from 0.1 to 2, the systematic heat transfer elevations and 
impediments over the trailing and leading surfaces, respectively, are clearly demonstrated by Fig. 
3-b. 
 
Variations of heat transfer performances from the static conditions in the rotating channel are 
revealed by presenting the heat transfer results in terms of Nu/Nu0 ratio. As Nu0 is correlated as 
function or Re in equation (3), the convergence of different Nu/Nu0 ratios obtained with different Re 
but at the same values of Ro and Bu indicates that the Re effect on Nu for the present rotating 
geometry follows that on the static heat transfer correlation for Nu0. Such a case enables the isolation 
of Re impact from the influences of Ro and Bu on Nu by way of presenting the rotational heat 
transfer data in terms of Nu/Nu0. This is testified by comparing several sets of Nu/Nu0 data that are 
obtained with four tested Reynolds numbers but at a fixed Ro with the approximately same values of 
Bu along the leading and trailing centerlines as indicated in Fig. 6. As shown in each plot of Fig. 6 at 
the representative cases of Ro = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1, four sets of axial Nu/Nu0 profiles along the 
centerline of leading or trailing wall at Re = 10000, 15000, 20000 and 24000 collapse into a tight 
data band that demonstrates the feasibility of isolating Re impact from the rotational effects on heat 
transfer using Nu/Nu0 data structure. As the Re impact on heat transfer performances in this rotating 
channel is isolated by presenting the rotational heat transfer data in terms of Nu/Nu0, the data trends 
depicted in each plot of Fig. 6 reflect the combined effects of the streamwise development of Ro-Bu 
effect. The Nu/Nu0 ratios along leading and trailing centerlines reach two asymptotic values in the 
periodically developed flow region with the higher ratios consistently developed at the trailing edge. 
Axial Nu/Nu0 profiles along the leading and trailing edges still follow the non-rotational heat transfer 
data of exponential decay. The combined Ro-Bu impacts on local heat transfer along leading and 
trailing centerlines as exemplified by Fig. 6 are consistently observed for all the heat flux settings 
tested. 
 
3.3 Parametric analysis of heat transfer results in rotating channel 
 
Variations of heat transfer performances under rotating conditions from the non-rotating scenarios 
are parametrically examined here in view of the isolated and interdependent Re, Bu and Ro impacts 
on heat transfer. As described previously, the three rib-wise heat transfer measurements at the mid-rib 
locations within the final rib-pitch over the leading or trailing wall of the rotating channel are 
averaged as Nu  to index the heat transfer level in the periodically developed flow region. The

In equation (4),  1 and  2 are functions of Ro that are correlating functions for heat transfer results 
in the periodically developed flow region of this rotating channel. The  1 function evaluates the 
zero-buoyancy heat transfer levels that features the sole Coriolis force effects on heat transfer. The 
various slopes of the fitted lines as shown in Fig. 7 are taken into account by the  2 function that 
represents the various degrees of Bu impact on heat transfer. The negative or positive sign of  2 
values respectively signify the impairing and improving heat transfer impacts while the magnitudes 
of  2 values reflect the degree of Bu impacts on heat transfer. Once again, the convergence of each 
Ro controlled data series obtained with different Re in all the plots of Fig. 7 reconfirms the 
applicability of scaling out Re effect from the combined Ro and Bu impacts on heat transfer by 
presenting the rotational heat transfer data in terms of Nu / 0Nu  ratio.  
 
Figure 8 depicts the variations of  1 value against Ro on the leading and trailing walls that reinstate 
the varying manners of the Ro controlled Coriolis force effects in isolation. Acting by the Coriolis 
force effect alone in the present rotating channel, the Nu / 0Nu  ratios on the leading wall tend to 
decrease linearly as Ro increases from 0.1 to 2. But the Nu / 0Nu  ratios increase in a form of 
complex exponential fashion as Ro increases on the trailing wall. However, the leading-wall heat 
transfer performances at the high rotation numbers (Ro>1) can be somewhat elevated by adding the 
improving buoyancy effects as Bu effects turn from impairing to improving heat transfer at the high 
rotation numbers. The present data ranges with involvements of the impairing Bu effects on trailing 
wall and the impairing or improving Bu effects on leading wall are also included in Fig. 8. The 
ranges of Nu / 0Nu  ratios on the leading and trailing walls with involvements of Bu impacts are 
0.7-0.5 and 1.1-1.6 respectively within the present parametric conditions examined. Converting the 
Nu / 0Nu  ratio into the HTE effectiveness in terms of Nu /Nu∞ for two opposite rotating surfaces 
roughened by the present compound roughness, the Nu /Nu∞ ratios on the leading and trailing walls 
respectively fall in the ranges of 2.7-3.3 and 5.7-8.8. The present type of rotating surface still offers 
the higher degrees of HTE ratios from those obtained in the rotating channels fitted with ribs, 
dimples or pin-fins. The lowest Nu / 0Nu  ratio or the so-called the worst heat transfer scenario for 
the present experimental conditions with the Bu effect involved develops at Ro = 2 with the 
NSC 96-2221-E-022-015-MY3

surface is proved itself for potential applications to the cooling networks inside rotor blades. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
The HTE performances for the novel compound roughness with V-ribs and deepened scales are 
testified under the rotating conditions with both ranges of Ro and Bu considerably extended into the 
realistic engine conditions. No previous study examines the heat transfer performances in the rotating 
channel fitted with the present compound HTE roughness. The following salient remarks are 
resolved by this study. 
 
1. Without accounting for the fin effects from the extended surfaces of the V-ribs and deepened 
scales, the HTE effectiveness in terms of Nu0/Nu∞ for the present compound roughness falls in the 
range of 5.4-5.1 with 10000<Re<24000 at the selected spanwise and centerline locations. The 
Nu0/Nu∞ ratio decreases with the increase of Re but is a weak function of Re. The 0Nu  correlation 
that evaluates the averaged mid-rib heat transfer levels in the periodically developed flow region 
of the present static channel is derived. 
2. The isolation of Re impact on rotational heat transfer from the interdependent Ro-Bu effects is 
achieved by representing the rotational heat transfer data in terms of Nu/Nu0 or Nu / 0Nu . Due to 
the combined Ro-Bu impacts with the present parametric conditions, the Nu /
0Nu  ratios are in the 
ranges of 0.5-0.7 and 1.1-1.6 on the leading and trailing walls respectively. This is equivalent to 
the Nu / Nu∞ ratios of about 2.7-3.3 and 5.7-8.8 at the detected spanwise and centerline locations. 
3. The Coriolis force effect alone consistently reduces and increases Nu  values on the leading and 
trailing walls, respectively, as Ro increases from 0.1 to 2. The worst heat transfer scenario 
develops on the leading wall that is mainly caused by the Coriolis effect and leads the ratio of 
Nu /
0Nu  ( Nu / Nu∞) to 0.4 (2.2).  
4. The individual rotating buoyancy effect impairs heat transfer on the trailing wall but such Bu 
effect is reversed from impeding to improving heat transfer on the leading wall as Ro increases 
above than 1. The degrees of Bu impacts on heat transfer are generally weakened as Ro increases. 
Inter-correlative influences of Ro and Bu on heat transfer in this rotating channel are reconfirmed. 
5. A set of heat transfer correlations that permits the evaluation of averaged Nusselt numbers at 
mid-rib locations of the periodically developed flow in the present rotating channel is derived to 
represent the experimental heat transfer data generated by this study with the individual and 
interdependent influences of Re, Ro and Bu on Nu to be assessed.

that reports the detailed flow and heat transfer phenomena for the shaker jet-swirl configuration. 
 
For piston cooling applications, the reciprocating acceleration results in the periodic body force 
acting on the coolant to modify the flow and heat transfer performances from the static conditions. 
Several relevant early studies examined a purely oscillatory flow superimposed on a steady Poiseuille 
flow, which demonstrated that the thickness of the boundary layer could be altered by flow pulsation 
and therefore affected the thickness of thermal resistance and its heat transfer rate [8,9]. A follow-up 
analytical study revealed the pulsation effect on heat transfer with the impacts of Pr and pulsation 
frequency examined [10]. This set of results indicated that, in a range of moderate pulsatile 
frequencies, there was a positive peak in the pulsation effect whereby the Nu was increased. But the 
pulsating effect on heat transfer was reversed when the frequency was out of this range [10]. For the 
shaker jet-swirl blind bore, Fig. 1(b), the previous studies that reported the thermophysics in an open 
thermosyphon (cavity) and in the blind duct with an entry jet are most relevant [1, 5-7, 11-15]. These 
studies focused on investigating the effects of channel configuration, buoyancy level, physical 
property, channel length-to-width (aspect) ratio, tilted angle and thermal boundary condition on flow 
and heat transfer in a static open thermosyphon (cavity) with the flow across the open entry [11-15]; 
but only a few studies examined the thermal-fluid physics with a jet issuing into a blind duct [5-7]. 
When the cross flow is generated across the open end of a thermosyphon duct, the largest and 
strongest vortice is induced at its immediate open entry. Depending on the channel aspect ratio (AR), 
a number of downstream coherent duct-wise vortices with weaker strengths are sequentially induced 
by their upstream vortices in a counter rotating manner [16]. As AR increases, the number of vortices 
in an open thermosyphon is generally increased but the strength of the vortice adjacent to the blind 
end is weakened. The buoyancy advection is the dominant physics for heat transfer in the flow region 
adjacent to the blind end [1]. With asymmetric wall temperature distributions around the perimeter of 
an open thermosyphon, the vortices driven by buoyancy forces in this flow region can be three 
dimensional [1]. When an open thermosyphon reciprocated, the characteristic flow structures in the 
static conditions were remained but the strengths and sizes of these vortices varied temporally in a 
periodic manner [16]. Local heat transfer rates in such a reciprocating open thermosyphon were 
initially reduced from the static levels but recovered and improved after the further increase of the 
relative strength of the reciprocating force indexed by Pu [2,16,17]. Our previous works that 
experimentally examined the heat transfer performances for a variety of piston cooling configurations 
[18-20] also reported the similar Pu-driven heat transfer variations. However, none of the previous 
works examined the detailed heat transfer performance in a simulated shaker jet-swirl blind duct. As 
depicted in Fig. 1(b), the lateral jet, which attaches on the duct wall, enters the upper portion of the 
vertical blind bore in the tangential direction to generate the swirl. The swirl, which sweeps the 
circumference of the channel, is driven toward the open end of the blind bore by the tube-wise 
pressure gradients developed within. The complex swirling flows, submerged jet and the developing 
boundary layers formulate the major, but complex, heat transfer enhancement (HTE) mechanisms.

facilities have been previously described [2]. The heat transfer test module is mounted on the 
platform of the reciprocating test rig with the orientation of the blind duct aligned with the direction 
of reciprocation. The test coolant, aerated water, is fed from a gravity tank and channeled through a 
needle valve and a volume flow meter to adjust and measure the coolant flow rate. To control the test 
Re and Pu at the targeting values, the coolant flow rate is constantly adjusted for compensating the 
changes in coolant properties due to temperature variations. The indication of the crank angle for the 
heat transfer test section at 0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 of a reciprocation period (T) is performed by an electrical 
circuit that comprises of three limited switches and three indicating lights. An infrared (IR) camera, 
which scans 60 temperature frames in one second, is secured at the supporting frames on the 
reciprocating platform. Such high scan rate of 0.016 seconds per snapshot is sufficient to detect the 
detailed wall temperature distributions at each targeting instant with the highest reciprocating 
frequency of 1.16 Hz. When the indicating light is flashed at the targeting instant, the IR system is 
activated to store the temperature data scanned from the heat transfer surface. Repeated tests are 
performed to ensure that the maximum temperature differences between several snapshots at each 
targeting instant are less than +0.5
0
C. The entry and exit fluid temperatures for the test section and 
the ambient temperature are measured by K type thermocouples which connect with the Fluke 
Net-Daq 2640A data logger to a personal computer. All the temperatures measurements and the 
relevant raw data, such as the reciprocating frequency, the coolant flow rate and the heating power, 
are monitored and stored by the personal computer. 
 
The constructional details and the geometric features of the square blind duct with a lateral entry jet 
are depicted in Fig. 2(a). The heating surface of the two opposite walls and a blind wall is made of a 
continuous 28mm wide, 0.1mm thick stainless steel foil (1), Fig. 2(a). This heating foil (1) is clamped 
between two Teflon sidewalls (2)(3), a Teflon back wall (4) and a Teflon frame (5) to form the square 
blind duct with uniform heat fluxes issuing from two opposite walls and the blind wall. The length (L) 
and hydraulic diameter (d) of the blind duct are 112mm and 28mm respectively. Only one heated 
surface allows for the visual assess of IR scan; while the remaining heating foil is secured by the 
Teflon walls for thermal insulation. A horizontal square jet nozzle (6) with width (dj) of 7mm 
penetrates through the duct sidewall (2) to issue a lateral entry jet. This nozzle (3) is machined as a 
square notch on the sidewall edge (2). The distance between the jet centerline and the blind wall is 
35mm or 0.313 equivalent duct length. A numerical analysis using the STAR CD commercial code 
[22] resolves the flow field in the present static blind duct. The conceptual flow diagram is 
accordingly constructed as Fig. 2(b) to assist the illustration of the basic flow structure in the blind 
duct. When the lateral jet, which attaches on the heating foil (1), traverses the blind duct, the 
diffusion of jet momentum causes jet expansion. After the jet impinges upon the corner constituted 
by the heating foil (1) and the sidewall (3), the jet diverts its traversing course to three directions for 
its spent flows, namely the upward, downward and circumferential streams. These three diverted 
spent flows are confined by the duct walls to induce vortices and swirls. The upward spent flow

2.2 Test program and data processing 
Initially, a series of heat transfer experiments is carried out at static conditions to generate the 
database against which the reciprocating results are compared to highlight the reciprocating effect on 
heat transfer. A parametric analysis, aimed at revealing the individual and interactive effects of Re, Pu, 
Grg (Grp) on local and area-averaged Nu, is subsequently performed with a set of Nu  correlations 
generated. In addition to the channel Reynolds number (Re), the jet Reynolds number (Rej) is also 
evaluated to specify the flow entry condition. The characteristic velocity and length selected for 
defining Rej are jet entry velocity and jet hydraulic diameter. Heat transfer tests are performed at five 
Re(Rej) of 1000(4000), 1500(6000), 2000(8000), 3000(12000), 5000(20000), 7000(28000) and 
10000(40000) with five reciprocating frequencies of 0 (static condition), 0.33, 0.5, 0.67 and 0.83 Hz. 
At each Rej (Re) and reciprocating frequency tested, four heating powers are used to raise the highest 
wall temperature on the scanned wall to 313, 323, 328 and 333 K. The quasi-steady state condition is 
assumed when the differences in the time-averaged wall temperatures (Tw) obtained from several 
successive IR scans are less than +0.5 K. Having reached such quasi-steady state, the on-line data 
acquisition system is activated to record the entire Tw measurements over the scanned area. For any 
reciprocating test condition, five sets of Tw scans at the quasi-steady states for each targeting 
periodical instant are acquired and compared to ensure the repeatability of the experimental data. 
Each set of collected raw data is post-processed into Nu, Rej, Re, Pu, Grg and Grp with their effects 
on Nu examined. The test conditions described by the controlling dimensionless parameters are 
summarized in Table 1.

The local Nusselt number is evaluated using Nu = qd/kf(Tw-Tj) where q, kf and Tj respectively stand 
for the local convective heat flux, the thermal conductivity of coolant and the jet entry temperature. 
Local q value is calculated by subtracting the external heat loss flux from the total heat flux generated 
in the stainless steel heating foil. The fluid properties of coolant such as kf and thermal expansion 
coefficient (β) are evaluated at the local film temperature (Tf) defined as (Tw+Tj)/2. The characteristic 
length selected to define Nusselt (Nu), Reynolds (Re), pulsating (Pu) and Grashof (Grg, Grp) numbers

the back wall is weaker than the jet-wall counterpart, the pressure gradients in the region of 
3.5<y/d<4 incur two asymmetrical re-circulation flow cells at the two bottom corners of the back wall, 
leading to two asymmetric low Nu0 regions on the bottom region, Fig. 3. At each fixed Re(Rej), 0Nu  
increases as Grg increases, Fig. 3. The buoyancy effect improves heat transfer for the present static 
blind duct. In this respect, a 29%-45% of 0Nu  elevation is driven by increasing Grg over the test 
ranges of Re(Rej) and Grg, indicating the considerable buoyancy effect on heat transfer. While the 
increase of Re(Rej) and/or Grg consistently elevates 0Nu , the characteristic patterns of Nu0 
distributions on the jet and back walls remain unchanged, Fig. 3. This result suggests that the basic 
flow structure in the blind duct is retained for each tested Re(Rej) and Grg. The adjustment of Re(Rej) 
or Grg varies the strengths of the spent flows, swirls and vortices in the blind duct. As Re(Rej) and/or 
Grg increases, the flow unsteadiness over the shear layers on the edges of the lateral jet and spent 
flows as well as the vortical interactions become more vigorous; which effects combine to elevate 
0Nu . 
 
The variations of 0Nu  against Grg at all Re tested for the jet and back walls are depicted in Figs. 4(a) 
and 4(b) respectively. At each Re tested, 0Nu  increases linearly as Grg increases, Fig. 4. On the jet 
wall, the slope of each Grg-driven linear 0Nu  trend increases as Re increases. Due to the 
aforementioned intergrowth Re-Grg impact on flow unsteadiness and vortical interaction, the 
improving buoyancy effect on heat transfer over the jet wall of the blind duct is enhanced as Re 
increases, Fig. 4(a). However, as the lateral jet only attaches on the jet wall, such Re dependent Grg 
effect on 0Nu  is less effective on the back wall. This is demonstrated by cross examining the 
different slopes for the Grg-driven 0Nu  trends for the jet and back walls at various Re in Figs. 4(a) 
and 4(b). By way of extrapolating each Grg-driven 0Nu  data series at a tested Re toward the limiting 
condition of Grg→0, the 0Nu  level at the tested Re with vanished buoyancy effect can be identified 
as ZBNu 0 . An additional set of 
ZB
Nu 0  results for the jet and back walls is accordingly generated using 
this curve fitting routine to reveal the individual Re effect on heat transfer. Justify by the consistent 
linear data trends revealed in Fig. 4, 0Nu  is correlated as: 
 
0Nu = 
ZB
Nu 0 {Re} + A{Re} × Grg             (1) 
 
In equation (1), ZBNu 0 and the A coefficient (slope) for each fitted line in Fig. 4 are functions of Re. 
Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) respectively depict the varying manners of ZBNu 0 and the A coefficient against Re. 
The interdependent Re and Grg effect on 0Nu is expressed as A{Re}. Such interdependent Re and 
Grg impact on 0Nu  lies in the complex interactions between the secondary flows induced by the 
lateral jet and the buoyancy induced vortices. Although the complex vortical structures are generated 
in the present blind duct, ZBNu 0  still inherits the characteristics of forced convection, which increases 
consistently as Re increases. In compliance with the forced convection characteristic for ZBNu 0 and the 
data trends depicted in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), ZBNu 0  and A-coefficients are correlated as the functions of

is followed by the jet flapping away from the jet wall as Pu increases to 4.1, suggests that the 
reciprocation induced flow modifications are lagging behind the changes in the direction of the 
reciprocating strokes due to the viscous damping effect. As depicted by the Nu snapshots in Figs. 6(b) 
and 6(c) at BDC and 3/4T, the y-wise jet deflection which develop at these test conditions can yield 
to the z-wise jet flapping when the Pu is further increased as demonstrated by Fig. 6(d). Within the 
present f range, such jet deflection and jet flapping generally take place when Re(Rej) is less than 
5000(20000) at which the jet momentum is relatively weak. With Re(Rej)>7000(28000), as typified 
by Fig. 6(a), no trace of jet flapping is observed; but the effective cooling region on the back wall 
appears to be extended from the static scenarios seen in Fig. 3. The Nu  over back wall at 
Re(Rej)=7000, Pu =1 is therefore raised above than the static 0Nu  reference. As the reciprocating 
force effect on the lateral jet is Re(Rej) dependent, there is interdependent Pu-Re impact on Nu ; 
which will be demonstrated in the later section of parametric analysis. After a complete review of all 
the reciprocating Nu snapshots, it is confirmed that such jet flapping is commonly observed at low 
Re(Rej); but the required Pu to initiate such jet flapping tends to be reduced as Grp increases. The 
upward stroke from BDC to TDC exerts the reverse reciprocating force component on the jet and on 
the vortical flows in the blind duct. But there is neither the y-wise upward jet deflection nor the 
z-wise jet flapping observed at 1/4T or TDC during the upward stroke, Figs. 6(a)-6(d). The blockage 
of the top blind end, along with the vortical flow cells generated between the lateral jet and the blind 
wall, clearly prohibit the upward and z-wise jet deflections within the present Re, Pu and Grp ranges 
tested. Therefore the jet flapping triggered by the reciprocating force effect is asymmetric along the 
blind duct. Nevertheless, justified by the Nu snapshots collected in Fig. 6 at the four periodic instants, 
the y-wise and/or z-wise jet-flaps take place in a periodic manner. These reciprocation induced 
influences on the lateral jet directly modify the Nu distributions and therefore the Nu  on the jet wall. 
Such heat transfer impacts produce the maximum and minimum Nu  at the TDC and BDC for each 
reciprocating cycle respectively.  
 
The aforementioned reciprocation effect on the lateral jet also exerts consequential influences on the 
Nu distributions over the back wall. As the characterized pattern for Nu distribution on the back wall, 
a high Nu band along the sidewall edge at x/w=1 is generated by the spent flow over this sidewall. 
While the y-wise spans for the high Nu band along the edge of x/w=1 on the back wall at the four 
periodic instants remain similar, the x-wise bandwidth for such high Nu region varies periodically. 
For 1/4 and 2/4 T at which the attached lateral jet extends its local HTE impact on jet wall, the 
bandwidth of the high Nu region along the edge of x/w =1 on the back wall also expands. Therefore 
the maximum and minimum Nu  on the back wall also respectively emerge at the TDC and BDC for 
each reciprocating cycle. However, unlike the direct Pu impact on the periodic Nu distributions over 
the jet wall, the patterns of Nu distribution on the back wall are less responsive to the variations of 
Re(Rej) and/or Pu, Fig. 6.

footprints along the attached lateral jet on the jet wall and extends the effective cooling region along 
the sidewall edge of x/w=1 on the back wall, Fig. 8. As Grp increases, the periodic Nu variations on 
the jet wall show no sign of the boosted jet flapping or the enhanced downward jet deflection, Fig. 8. 
The characteristic patterns of the Nu distributions for each reciprocating cycle remain similar for all 
the Grp tested at each set of Pu and Re. As the Grp driven Nu variations at T= 0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 in Fig. 8 
are typical for all the reciprocating test results, the increase of Grp is unlikely to promote the jet 
instability but enriching the jet momentum, leading to local Nu and Nu  elevations on jet and back 
walls. 
 
The aforementioned Pu- and Grp- driven Nu variations at each periodic instant have consequential 
influences on the area-averaged Nusselt number ( Nu ) over each scanned reciprocating wall. By 
averaging the four Nu  obtained at T = 0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, the time- and area- averaged Nusselt number 
is obtained and then normalized by 0Nu  into Nu / 0Nu  to index the reciprocating influence on the 
overall heat transfer performance. For each reciprocating Nu snapshot at the scanned instant, the 
corresponding 0Nu  is obtained by substituting the equivalent Grg, which is determined from the 
wall-to-fluid temperature differences measured from the reciprocating wall, and Re into equations 
(2)(3). Each Nu / 0Nu  quantifies the overall heat transfer modification from the static reference at 
the reciprocating condition specified by the tested Pu and Grp. It is worth noting that Nu  is 
increased by increasing Grp; while 0Nu  also increases as Grg increases. If the degree of Grp impact 
on elevating Nu  is less than the degree of Grg impact on elevating 0Nu , the Nu / 0Nu  ratios 
obtained at four ascending Grp with fixed Re and Pu will decrease with the increase of Grp. The 
varying trends of Nu / 0Nu  against Pu at several tested Re with four ascending Grp over the jet and 
back walls are showed in Figs. 9 (a)(b) respectively. When the jet momentum is relatively weak at 
Re(Rej)=1000(4000), 2000(8000) and 3000(12000), the Nu / 0Nu  ratios can fall below unity, 
indicating the reduced heat transfer levels from the static references, Fig. 9. As described previously, 
although the vortical structures in the blind duct are subject to the periodic swell and shrink due to 
the reciprocating force effect, the jet flapping developed at Re=1000, 2000, 3000 could undermine 
the heat transfer performance from the static condition, Figs. 9(a)(b). The further increases of Re up 
to 7000 and 10000 prevent the jet flapping within the f range tested so that the Nu / 0Nu  ratios on 
both jet and back walls are raised to be higher than unity, Figs. 9 (a)(b). It is also interesting to note 
that the Grp driven Nu / 0Nu  data spreads in Figs. 9 (a) and (b) at various Pu and Rej are respectively 
upward and downward for the jet and back walls. Therefore the degrees of Grp impact on elevating 
Nu  over the jet and back walls are respectively stronger and weaker than the favorable Grg impacts 
on 0Nu . The reciprocating buoyancy force exerts the stronger impacts on the jet wall than those on 
the back-wall. A review of the entire Nu / 0Nu  data generated, the ranges of Nu / 0Nu  respectively 
fall between 0.78-1.3 and 0.8-1.51 over the jet and back walls as a result of the interactive Re-Pu-Grp 
impacts. In addition to the Grp driven Nu / 0Nu  spreads showed in Figs. 9 (a)(b), the various Pu 
driven data trends obtained at different Re are not converged into a tight data band. This is in

Nu  variation in Fig. 11(a), the 
quadratic function is adopted to correlate 
ZB
Nu  into the function of Pu with its correlative 
coefficients determined as the functions of Re. Nevertheless, for physical consistency, the

 using equations (2)(3) for the jet and back walls 
respectively. The variations of the correlative coefficients in the quadratic functions that correlate the

Nu  data trends are plotted against Re as shown as Fig. 11(b). After correlating these 
coefficients, namely a0, a1, a2, as the functions of Re in accordance with the data trends depicted by 
Fig. 11(b), the

Nu  correlation is generated as equations (5)(6) for the jet and back walls.

The dependency of the reciprocating buoyancy effect on Pu at a fixed Re is indicated in Fig. 12(a) by 
plotting the variations of ξ against Pu. With the presence of the attached lateral jet, the local density 
gradients of fluids over the jet wall are higher their back-wall counterparts. Having imposed the 
various near-wall flows with different density perturbations upon the reciprocating acceleration field, 
the different degrees of reciprocating buoyancy impacts on Nu  are produced between the jet and 
back walls. This is demonstrated by cross examining the ξ values derived from the jet and back walls 
in Fig. 12(a). With the higher degrees of fluid density gradients over the jet wall, ξ for the jet wall is 
consistently higher than its back-wall counterpart, indicating the higher degree of reciprocating 
buoyancy effect over the jet wall. Nevertheless, the Pu driven ξ variations at all the tested Re over the 
jet and back walls follow a general pattern of exponential decay, Fig. 12(a). The reciprocating 
buoyancy effect is weakened as Pu increases. In particular, as the family of ξ curves in Fig. 12(a) also 
show the consistent Re-driven upward data spreads at a fixed Pu, then higher ξ values are expected at 
the lower Re. In other words, the increase of Re at a fixed Pu reduces ξ. The interdependent Grp-Pu 
and Grp-Re impacts on Nu  are confirmed by the consistent results collected in Fig. 12(a). In this 
respect, the impact of reciprocating buoyancy on Nu  is weakened by either increasing Re or Pu. 
Justified by the consistent data trends revealed in Fig. 12 (a), ξ is correlated by a general form of: 
 
ξ = B{Rej} + C{Rej} × e 
–D{Rej}× Pu
               (7) 
 
As the coefficients B, C, D in equation (6) are functions of Re, the variations of B, C, D coefficients 
against Re are plotted as Figs. 12(b) in order to correlate B, C, D coefficients into the functions of Re. 
After submitting the B, C, D correlations, which are determined in accordance with the data trends 
depicted by Figs. 12(b), into equation (6), the ξ equations for the jet and back walls are generated as

4. Conclusions 
 
1. The attached lateral jet together with the spent and swirling flows induced by the asymmetric 
impinging jet in the static blind duct generate a high Nu0 region along the jet-pathway on the jet 
wall and a longitudinal high Nu0 stripe along the sidewall edge at x/w=1 on the back wall. The 
increase of Re(Rej) and/or Grg consistently elevates 0Nu  with the distributing Nu0 patterns 
remaining unchanged. Due to the intergrowth Re-Grg HTE impact, the improving buoyancy effect 
on heat transfer is enhanced as Re increases. The 0Nu  correlations are generated as equations (2) 
and (3) for the jet and back walls respectively. 
2. In addition to the Pu and Grp impacts on the entire flow structure, the reciprocating force directly 
acts on the lateral jet in a cyclic manner to incur the downward jet deflection and z-wise jet 
flapping at high Pu as Re(Rej) is less than 5000(20000) for the present test configuration. Such 
direct reciprocating effect on the lateral jet modifies the Nu distributions with the maximum and 
minimum Nu  develop at the TDC and BDC respectively. When the reciprocation induced jet- 
flapping takes place at Re(Rej)<5000, the Pu-driven Nu  impediment is accordingly observed. 
By way of increasing Re(Rej) to leave out the jet flapping, the high Nu imprints over the jet and 
back walls remain effective so that the Pu-driven Nu  elevation re-emerge due to the wafting 
vortical structures which improve the fluid mixing in the reciprocating blind duct. The various 
Pu-driven Nu variations on jet and back walls at different Re serve as the heat transfer physics 
responsible for the interdependent Re and Pu impact on Nu  correlations. 
3. The increase of Grp at fixed Re and Pu enhances the high Nu footprints of the attached jet on the 
jet wall and extends the effective cooling region on the back wall, leading to the consistent heat 
transfer enhancements over the reciprocating jet and back walls. 
4. As an indication of the combined Re-Pu-Grp impact on the overall heat transfer performance, the 
Nu / 0Nu  ranges over the jet and back walls fall between 0.78-1.3 and 0.8-1.51 respectively. By 
taking the benefits of the attached impinging jet which also induces the downstream swirls, 
together with the developing entry flow near the sealed end to improve the fluency of coolant 
flow in the blind duct, the Nu /Nu∞ range for the present flow configuration is elevated to 2.3 – 
8.3, which is much improved from those developed in the plain shaker bore and jet-shaker bore.  
5. The isolated and interdependent Pu, Re and Grp effects on Nu  for the present blind duct with a 
lateral entry jet have been taken into account in the physically consistent Nu  correlations to 
assist the determination of the overall heat transfer levels over the jet and back walls.

In order to promote the cooling effectiveness from the shaker cooling system, the shaker-jet piston 
cooling scheme is subsequently developed, Fig. 1(b). For the shaker-jet cooling scheme, the cold jets 
enter the multiple blind bores from the nozzle array attached on the piston rod so that the penetration 
of cold coolant into each blind bore is improved from the shaker cooling scheme. After the jet enters 
each shaker-jet blind bore, the cold jet which expands in the tube-wise direction is encapsulated by 
the hot return stream. The strong shear layers are accordingly generated over the counter-flowing 
conical envelope between the cold expanding entry-jet and the hot encapsulating return-flow to 
augment turbulent activities. Heat transfer levels for such shaker-jet bore are considerably elevated 
from the shaker bore scenarios as a result of the improved coolant penetration and the augmented 
turbulent activities [22]. But the duct-wise decay of jet momentum due to the viscous diffusion and 
the adverse pressure gradients over the close end region still undermines the regional heat transfer 
performance adjacent to the close end of each blind bore. For such shaker-jet bore cooling scheme, 
the hot region still develops at its close end [22] over which the most effective cooling performance 
is requested. 
 
As an attempt to facilitate the more effective cooling performance over the end region of each blind 
bore, the shaker jet-swirl cooling scheme is recently developed, Fig. 1(c). The shaker jet-swirl 
scheme injects the cold coolant into the blind bore near its close end by way of lateral injection in a 
direction tangent to the circumference of each blind bore, Fig. 1(c). Due to the jet induced 
downstream swirls in each blind bore, the fluency and mixing of the coolant flow in each blind bore 
are considerably improved. The HTE performances for the shaker jet-swirl scheme are further 
improved from the shaker-jet cooling system [23]. However, due to the structure considerations, the 
location of the laterally tangent entry jet is not permissible at the immediate close end of each blind 
bore. Among the flow region above the jet plane, the up-surge of the spent flow from the impinging 
jet induces several longitudinal vortices underneath the sealed end of the blind bore. Although this 
cooling configuration has the specific application to the shaker jet-swirl piston cooling scheme, such 
entry jet flow configuration can be treated as an alternative HTE measure to attack the close-end 
cooling problems, such as the cooling of static gas turbine blade and the tip of an acetylene welder. 
For further HTE improvement from the shaker jet-swirl scheme, this study employs the compound 
V-ribs and scale imprints as the roughened walls of the reciprocating blind bore. Our previous studies 
have confirmed the favorable HTE performances for this type of compound roughness at the static 
and rotating conditions [24-25]. However, no previous study in the open literature has reported the 
heat transfer phenomena for the shaker jet-swirl configuration enhanced by the scaled imprints and 
V-ribs at the reciprocating condition. This study emulates closely the cooling passage of the shaker 
jet-swirl scheme with the particular emphasis on the HTE impacts using the compound scale-rib 
roughness at the reciprocating conditions. Local and averaged heat transfer performances for the 
smooth-walled and rib-scale roughened square blind ducts are cross examined. For each test duct, the 
heat transfer tests are performed by controlling the reciprocating frequency, the heat flux and the 
NSC 96-2221-E-022-015-MY3    
 
103 
 
along which the physically consistent Nu  correlations are generated. 
 
2.1 Experimental facilities 
The reciprocating test rig is driven by a crank-wheel mechanism with adjustable frequencies in the 
range of 0-2 Hz that matches the piston running frequencies in a marine heavy-duty propulsive diesel 
engine. The controlling units for the experimental facilities and the instrumentations measuring the 
flow rate, reciprocating frequency and wall/fluid temperatures have been previously reported [19-20]. 
For this investigation, the heat transfer test module is vertically mounted on the reciprocating test rig 
with the orientation of the blind duct aligned with the directions of gravity and reciprocating motion. 
The test coolant, dry air, is supplied from an air tank fed by a 15,000W screw-type compressor. Prior 
to entering the heat transfer test module, the pressurized airflow is channeled through a dehumidifier, 
a needle valve and a mass flow meter which respectively adjust and measure the airflow rate into the 
test duct. To keep Re and Pu at the predefined test values, the airflow rate is constantly adjusted for 
compensating the changes in coolant properties due to temperature variations.  
 
Fig. 2(a) shows the constructional details of the heat transfer test module. The 160mm long, square 
blind duct is formulated by four Teflon plates (1) with its top end sealed by a 15mm thick Teflon 
flange (2). The inner width (w), or the hydraulic diameter (d), of the square blind duct is 40mm. As 
indicated in Fig. 2(a), the origin of the XYZ coordinate system is positioned at the center of the duct 
width with Z=0 at the blind end. A 26mm long nozzle tube (3) with the inner diameter (dj) of 8mm 
issues the laterally tangent jet into the blind duct. The center of the jet nozzle (3) is 40mm (5dj) away 
from the sealed end. Two 3.89mm thick copper plates (4) are attached on the two opposite jet and 
back walls of the blind duct. A pair of electrical heater plates (5) is sandwiched between the Teflon 
wall (1) and the copper plate (4) to generate the basically uniform heat flux. By adjusting the heater 
powers to control the wall temperatures at a number of predefined values, the buoyancy effect on 
heat transfer are examined by comparing the set of Nu data generated with different Grp(Grg) at fixed 
Re and Pu. 
 
For the scale-rib roughened blind duct, the two cooper plates and the other two Teflon sidewalls are 
roughened as the compound scale-imprints and V-ribs as seen in Fig. 2(b). The V-ribs and scale 
imprints on each pair of the two opposite walls are arranged in staggered manner with the 
geometrical definitions defined in Fig. 2(b). The scale imprints are deepened into each roughened 
wall between two adjacent V ribs. For the smooth or rib-scale roughened blind duct, the axial wall 
temperatures (Tw) along the centerline over each of the two opposite jet and back walls are measured 
by eight Ni-Ch/Ni-Al (K type) thermocouples (TC) with the sensing junction keeping 0.5mm away 
from the inner surface of the blind duct. This is achieved by machined a 1.5mm deep, 10mm wide, 
axial groove along the centerline on the back of each copper heated plate. The location of each TC 
along the axial centerline is at the mid-rib location, Fig. 2(b). On the back of the copper heated plate

material is packed between the heated test duct and the stiffening Teflon tube for minimizing the 
external heat loss. Prior to the heat transfer tests, the calibration tests aimed at determining the 
characteristics of the external heat loss are performed [7,11,19] to correlate the external heat-loss 
flux as the function of f and wall-to-ambient temperature difference. The maximum heat loss flux 
takes place at the highest wall temperature settings and reciprocating frequency, which is about 9.4% 
of the total heat flux supplied. Table I summarizes the geometrical features of the test section.

2.2 Experimental program and data processing 
For the smooth or the scale-rib roughened heat transfer test module, a series of static heat transfer 
tests is initially carried out at Re(Rej)=5000(31850), 10000(63690), 15000(95540) and 20000(127400) 
to acquire the database against which the reciprocating results are compared. The following series of 
reciprocating heat transfer tests is performed at the targeting Pu and Re using a number of 
reciprocating frequencies. By adjusting the coolant mass flow rate and the reciprocating frequency, 
Re(Rej) and Pu can be both controlled at the predefined values. For each set of Re(Rej) and Pu, four 
heating powers are used to raise the highest wall temperature on the scanned wall to 323, 343, 363 
and 383 K with different Grp(Grg). Data batches generated at the same Re(Rej) and Pu with different 
Grp(Grg) reveals the isolated buoyancy effects on Nu and Nu . The individual and interactive effects 
of Re, Pu, Grp(Grg) on local and area-averaged Nu are subsequently examined with a set of Nu  
correlations generated. All the raw data are recorded when the flow in the blind duct reaches the 
quasi-steady state condition which is assumed when the differences in the time-averaged wall 
temperatures (Tw) obtained from several successive scans remain less than +0.3 K. The time-averaged 
wall temperature is obtained by averaging the integrated instant Tw measurements over 10 seconds. 
Having satisfied such quasi-steady state, the on-line data acquisition system is activated to record all 
the Tf, Tj, Tw and the relevant measurements, such as the heater power, the airflow rate and the 
reciprocating frequency. Each set of the collected raw data is post-processed into Nu, Re(Rej), Pu, 
Grg(Grp). Table II summarizes the test conditions using the controlling dimensionless parameters.

jet entry condition that induces swirling flows in these two test ducts, the heat transfer levels over the 
jet and back walls are elevated from the Dittus-Boelter correlation level as typified by Figs. 3 and 4; 
even if the fluid reference temperature selected to define the Nusselt number is the jet entry 
temperature. In Figs. 3(a) which displays the centerline axial Nu0 variations on jet wall, the axial Nu0 
peak develops at Z=1 (jet plane) for both smooth and roughened test ducts. Axial Nu0 decays away 
from the jet location on the jet wall are followed in the upward and downward directions from the jet 
plane, Fig. 3(a). As the lateral jet attaches on the jet wall, a low lateral (X-wise) Tw region with its 
band width expanding in the transverse jet direction to reflect the trajectory of the lateral jet on the jet 
wall is expected. It is interesting to note that, although the selected orientation of the present V-ribs is 
attempted to trip the cold fluid toward the region adjacent to the close end by the rib-induced flows as 
indicated in Fig. 2, the strong cross flows sweeping over the jet wall between the jet plane and the 
close end (0.19<Z<1) remain as the dominant flow physic for the jet-wall cooling. Therefore the 
similar centerline axial Nu0 variations, as well as the similar X-wise Nu0 profiles over the smooth and 
roughened jet walls are observed in Fig. 3. Over the back wall where the strength of the cross flow is 
weakened from the jet-wall counterpart, the influences of the surface roughness on Nu0 are observed. 
While the axial Nu0 peak consistently develops at Z=1 on the jet wall for each Re tested, the degrees 
of Nu0 peak along the centerline axial Nu0 profiles near the jet plane at Z=0.9 on the smooth and 
roughened back walls are moderated from those developed on the jet walls, Fig. 4(a). Clearly, the 
spreading of the spent flow over the impinging sidewall at −0.5X diffuses the jet momentum and 
generates a cross flow sweeping over the back wall. The axial Nu0 peak at Z=1 on the jet wall, which 
signifies the attached lateral jet on the jet wall, is therefore moderated over the back wall, Fig. 4(a). 
The X-wise Nu0 variations showed by the plots in Figs. 3 and 4 mainly reflect the circulating 
manners of the cross-sectional flows induced by the lateral entry jet. When the attached lateral jet 
flows on the jet-wall from the entrance at X=0.5 toward the X=−0.5 sidewall, the lateral jet is 
accordingly heated with the typical X-wise Nu0 decay generated on both smooth and roughened jet 
walls, Fig. 3(e). Justified by the similar pattern of the X-wise Nu0 decay on the jet wall at Z=0.19, 
0.38 and 0.69 as depicted by Figs. 3(b), (c) and (d), the cross flow sweeping over the jet wall above 
the jet plane (Z=1) follows the direction of the lateral jet. Nevertheless, the detailed vortical 
structures over the cross sectional planes above the jet plane (Z=1) vary as Z approaches toward the 
close end (Z=0). The subtle differences between the detailed X-wise Nu0 distributions at Z=0.19, 0.38, 
0.69 and 1 are therefore observed, Figs. 3(e)→3(b). In this respect, the X-wise Nu0 decay over the 
region of 0<X<0.5 on the jet wall is systematically moderated as Z approaches the close end. After 
this lateral jet impinges on the duct corner confined by the jet wall and the X=−0.5 sidewall, the spent 
flow spreads upward, downward and in the direction toward the back-wall from the impinging corner. 
This spent flow after impingement redirects the coolant to flow toward the back wall along the 
X=−0.5 sidewall over the entire duct length. Without the V-orientated rib flows, the near wall flow on 
the smooth back wall is directed from the axial edge of X=−0.5 toward the 0.5X edge. This flow 
feature gives rise to the general left-to-right Nu0 decays on the smooth back wall at Z= 0.56, 0.9 and 
NSC 96-2221-E-022-015-MY3    
 
109 
 
spread is gradually reduced as Z increases toward the open end as seen in Figs. 3, 4 (b)→(e). This 
result suggests the weakened buoyancy effect in the Z-wise direction. The most considerable 
buoyancy effect in each blind test duct prevails over the flow region adjacent to the close end. As the 
distributing patterns of the axial and X-wise Nu0 profiles showed by Figs. 3 and 4 remain similar at 
different Grg, the flow structures are not considerably altered by varying the buoyancy level at the 
present test conditions.  
 
The aforementioned Nu0 data, which typify the results obtained at all the tested Re, reflect the effects 
of Re and Grg on local heat transfer rates. A parametric assessment of the Re and Grg effects on the 
overall heat transfer performances are subsequently performed. By averaging all the Nu0 data 
measured from the jet or back wall as 0Nu  for each set of Re and Grg tested, the varying manner of 
0Nu  against Grg at a fixed Re reveals the isolated buoyancy effect. As shown in Fig. 5 for (a) jet and 
(b) back walls, 0Nu  consistently increases as Grg increases for each tested Re. This re-confirms that 
the buoyancy effect improves the overall heat transfer performance in each static blind test duct. 
Nevertheless, the slope of each Grg-driven 0Nu  elevation systematically increases as Re increases, 
Fig. 5. The improving buoyancy (Grg) effect on 0Nu  is augmented as Re increases so that the 
inter-correlative Grg-Re effect on 0Nu  correlation is demonstrated. As a HTE indication of the 
present surface roughness for the static blind duct, the variations of 0Nu roughened/ 0Nu smooth against 
Grg over jet and back walls at all the tested Re are respectively compared in Fig. 5(c). For both jet 
and back walls, 0Nu roughened/ 0Nu smooth increases as Re increases; but decreases as Grg increases, Fig. 
5(c). Due to the present surface roughness, 0Nu roughened/ 0Nu smooth can be increased up to 1.4 at 
Re=20000, Fig. 5(c). The tripping effects by the scale imprints and V-ribs, which attribute to HTE 
performances, are augmented when the flow momentum inside the blind duct is enhanced by 
increasing Re. The jet-wall 0Nu roughened/ 0Nu smooth are consistently higher than the back-wall 
counterparts. Therefore the higher degrees of HTE impact due to the present surface roughness 
develop on the jet wall over which the stronger sweeping near-wall flows are present. Justified by the 
consistent Grg driven linear 0Nu  trend in Figs. 5 (a), (b) and the inter-correlative Grg-Re effect on 
0Nu , the 0Nu  correlation takes a general form of: 
 
0Nu  =φ1{Re} + φ2{Re} × Grg              (4) 
 
The respective physical implications of φ1 and φ2 are the 0Nu  level at the condition with vanished 
buoyancy effect (Grg→0) and the degree of buoyancy effect on 0Nu . Figs. 6 (a) and (b) respectively 
compare φ1 and φ2 between the roughened/smooth and jet/back walls at the four tested Re. The φ1 
value, which is referred to as the zero-buoyancy 0Nu  at the test condition of Re≠0, Grg→0, 
increases as Re increases, Fig. 6(a). The dotted lines shown in Fig. 6(a) are the fitted curves for these 
Re driven data trends using the power law correlations. The φ2 values for the smooth and roughened 
jet walls as compared in Fig. 6(b) are in close agreements, indicating the equivalent degrees of Grg 
NSC 96-2221-E-022-015-MY3

smooth and roughened test ducts are systematically reduced with the tendency to converge toward the 
single-swirl dominant heat transfer characteristics, Figs. 7(a), 8(a). 
 
The heat transfer results depicted by Figs. 7 and 8 are typical for all the reciprocating test results; but 
the degrees of reciprocating impacts on heat transfer vary with Re, Pu and Grp. A parametric analysis 
aimed at revealing the individual and interdependent Re, Pu and Grp effects on heat transfer is 
formulated with the attempt to generate the empirical heat transfer correlations for the present 
reciprocating test ducts. Initially, the variations of the averaged reciprocating Nusselt number ( Nu ) 
against Grp at several fixed Pu are collected in each plot of Fig. 9 for a test Re. The Nu  obtained 
from the smooth and roughened ducts are also comparatively presented in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b) for the 
jet and back walls respectively. At each fixed Pu, Nu  increases linearly as Grp increases, Fig. 9. 
Each linear Nu  trend is constituted by four data points with ascending Grp at a fixed Pu and subject 
to Pu effects. In this regard, the slopes of these Grp driven Nu  elevations at a fixed Re reduce 
systematically as Pu increases. The improving Grp effect on Nu  is weakened when the relative 
strength of the reciprocating force quantified by Pu increases, revealing the interdependent Grp-Pu 
impact on Nu . For the smooth jet wall, these four-point Nu  data series keep reducing as Pu 
increases from 0.05-0.2 at all the tested Re. Such consistent reductions in Nu  series driven by 
increasing Pu from 0.05-0.2 are followed by the results obtained from the jet and back walls for both 
smooth and roughened reciprocating test ducts at Re=5000, Fig. 9. Further increase of Re to 
Re>10000, the increase of Pu keeps reducing the levels of the Nu  series for the smooth jet wall; 
but the Nu  series over the roughened jet wall and over the smooth and roughened back walls reach 
the minimum levels at Pu=0.15 or 0.18 above which the Nu  series are recovered, Fig. 9. In this 
respect, the reciprocating force effects within the present Re and Pu ranges tend to trigger the 
unfavorable jet flapping that impairs the heat transfer rates over the reciprocating smooth jet wall. 
The present surface roughness as well as the increase of Re tend to advance the heat transfer recovery 
by reducing the critical Pu above which the Nu  starts to increase with the increase of Pu. The 
consistent linear Nu  variations against Grp in Fig. 9 permit Nu  to be correlated as: 
 
Nu = 1{Pu, Re} + 2 {Pu, Re} × Grp            (9) 
 
In equitation (9), 1 and 2 are functions of Pu and Re, which respectively stand for the zero 
buoyancy Nu  and the slope of each linear Grp driven Nu  variation at a set of fixed Re and Pu. As 
2 which indicates the degree of the reciprocating buoyancy effect on Nu  varies with Pu and Re, 
the independent Re-Pu-Grp effect on Nu  is demonstrated. The variations of zero-buoyancy Nu  
(1) against Pu at all the tested Re are collected in Figs. 10 for (a) smooth (b) roughened test ducts. 
The 1 values at Pu=0 for Re=5000, 10000, 15000, 20000 in each plot of Fig. 10 need to return to the 
static heat transfer levels with vanished buoyancy effect and are evaluated as the 0Nu  at Grg=0 
using equations (4)-(7). With vanished Grp effect, the results depicted by Fig. 10 typify the isolated

The Nu  at each set of tested Re, Pr and Grp is determined using equation (9) after substituting a1-a3 
and b1-b3 coefficients into 1 and 2 correlations. The Nu  correlations generated by this study are 
complied with the limiting conditions of Pu→0 and Grp→ 0 and permitted the evaluation of the 
individual and interdependent effects of Re, Pu and Grp on Nu . To assess the overall performances 
of these Nu  correlations, Fig. 13 compares the entire experimental Nu  data with the calculated 
results using the Nu  correlations for (a) jet and (b) back walls. The maximum discrepancy of +30% 
between the experimental and correlating Nu  results is achieved for the entire data generated, Fig. 
13. The data clusters of Nu  for the roughened duct are relatively higher than those obtained from 
the smooth duct, suggesting the improving heat transfer performances by the present scale and V-rib 
surface roughness. Within the parametric ranges examined using dry air as the coolant, the ratios of 
Nu  between the reciprocating and stationary jet and back walls respectively fall between 0.68–0.9 
and 0.69–0.89 for the smooth duct; and 0.63–0.97 and 0.62–0.99 for the roughened duct. Nu  over 
the roughened reciprocating jet and back walls are respectively raised to 1.04–1.4 and 1.01–1.14 
times of the smooth-walled counterparts, suggesting the HTE impacts by the present scale and V-rib 
surface roughness for the reciprocating blind duct.

indentation; which advect over the downstream flat surface on 
the dimpled wall and (3) the periodic unsteadiness generated 
when the vortices in the form of collections of vortex pairs or 
short braids of vortical fluid are ejected and then inrushes to 
each concave dimple [20,21]. Unlike the rotating channel 
roughened by the angled ribs which induce the strong 
cross-sectional vortical flows, the HTE impact offered by the 
concave dimples is less than the HTE effect generated by the 
45
0
 ribs in a rotating channel [15,17]. Nevertheless, by 
converting the concave dimples to the spherical protrusions, 
which are referred to as the convex dimples in our previous 
comparative study for the fin channels [22], the separated 
vortical flows tripped by the spherical protrusions result in the 
higher degree of HTE impact than that generated by the 
concave dimples. The peak Nu develops over each spherical 
protrusion rather than the reduced Nu inside each concave 
dimple [22]. Such improved HTE effect by the spherical 
protrusions stimulates the present study to examine the HTE 
performance of the spherical protrusions in a rotating channel. 
 
In addition to the search into the effective HTE device for 
turbine rotor blade cooling, another goal under the constant 
pursuit is the acquisition of the full field Nu measurement 
over a rotating channel at the realistic engine conditions with 
the rotating buoyancy effect examined. The fast progress of 
these research goals has been prohibited by the extremely high 
rotor speed of a gas turbine engine and the difficulty in 
measuring the full field Nu data from a rotating channel with 
the density ratio (Δρ/ρ) effect examined. But, whilst progress 
for these research goals is moving forward by generating the 
Nu data at high Ro, the experimental technology is not yet 
sufficiently advanced to acquire the full-surface Nu 
measurement with both Coriolis and rotating buoyancy effects 
examined. The pressing needs to acquire the full Nu scans 
including the rotating buoyancy effect, together with the 
attempt to examine the HTE performance of the spherical 
protrusions in a rotating channel, motivate this study. This 
experimental study examines the Coriolis and rotating 
buoyancy effects on the detailed Nu distributions over the 
leading and trailing walls of a rectangular channel with two 
opposite walls roughened by the spherical protrusions at high 
Ro up to 0.6. The surface temperatures (Tw) over two opposite 
leading and trailing walls roughened by the spherical 
protrusions are measured by the infrared thermography which 
allows the full-field Tw scan at the prescribed buoyancy level. 
The major benefit of this experimental approach is the added 
insight gained into the heat transfer physics arising from the 
full Nu scans with the rotating buoyancy effect disclosed. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 
Rotating test facility and heat transfer test module 
The rotating test rig and its control and instrumentation 
devices have been previously described [10-12, 16-17]. A 
brief description of the rotating test facility along with the 
detailed illustration of the heat transfer test module is 
presented. The rotating test rig comprises a pair of 
counter-balanced rotating arms for securing the infrared 
camera (IC), the coolant and power supplies, the signal 
transmission devices and a rotating platform on which the 
assorted heat transfer test module is mounted. This heat 
transfer test module is mounted on the rotating platform with 
a mean rotating radius (r) of 420 mm to the mid-span of the 
test section. The rotating speed of the test channel is in the 
range of 0-110 rev/min. The dry and cool pressurized airflow 
is channeled through the rotary seal, the shaft bore, the heat 
transfer test channel and the exhaust valve located at the exit 
of the test module. The adjustment of the exhaust valve 
permits the control of the test pressure inside the heat transfer 
test section. The range of test gauge pressures inside the 
channel is 0.1-0.46 bar. By selecting the rotor speed and the 
test pressure enables both Re and Ro to be simultaneously 
controlled at the target values. The rotor assembly is driven 
by a variable-speed DC motor via a pulley system using three 
V belts. Two separate power slip rings transmit the electrical 
powers for heating the test section and for the IC. Another 
two separate sets of instrumentation slip ring units 
respectively transfer the signals from thermocouples, 
measuring the fluid entry and exit temperatures via the Fluke 
Net-Daq 2640A data logger, and the wall temperature scans 
detected by the IC. The rotor speed is measured by the optical 
pick-up and encoder unit attached to the shaft. Prior to the 
rotating heat transfer test, the rotor assembly is dynamically 
balanced by the counter weights.  
 
The rectangular test channel with two opposite leading and 
trailing walls roughened by the staggered spherical 
protrusions, as well as the layout of the test section with the 
IC positions relative to the test rig are depicted in Fig. 1. The 
channel width (W) of 80mm and channel height (H) of 40mm 
give rise the channel width-to-height ratio (aspect ratio, AR) 
of 2 and the channel hydraulic diameter (d) of 53 mm. The 
active heating length of the test channel (L) is 275mm, giving 
the L/d ratio of 5.2. The test channel is rotated orthogonally 
with respect to the axis of rotation. The leading and trailing 
walls in respect to the direction of rotation and the present x-y 
coordinate system are indicated in Fig. 1.  
 
Fig. 1 Heat transfer test module. 
The spherical protrusions are arranged as the 10×4 staggered 
array with a pitch ratio (P/Ds) of 30mm/10mm=3. The two 
opposite leading and trailing roughened walls (1)(2) are made

Δρ/ρ is the local value as Tw-Tb varies with x and y. It is 
therefore impractical to control Bu=β(Tw-Tb)Ro
2
(r/d) at a 
pre-defined targeting value during each heat transfer test. The 
nominal Bu for each rotational heat transfer test has to be post 
processed by averaging all the local Bu obtained from the 
rotating surface. By way of varying the heater power, the local 
β(Tw-Tb) and consequently the Bu value are accordingly 
adjusted. The isolated Bu effect on heat transfer is readily 
realized by comparing the four sets of Nu scans obtained at 
different Bu but with the fixed Re and Ro. As the adjustment 
of heater power varies local Tb that affects the local fluid 
properties such as the coolant viscosity, the airflow fed into 
the test channel is constantly adjusted to compensate the 
changes of fluid properties in order to control Re and Ro at the 
targeting values with +1% deviations on the flow entrance. 
Having acquired all the experimental raw data at each test 
condition specified in Table 1, the parametric analysis, aimed 
at disclosing the functional relationships between Nu and Re, 
Ro, Bu for the geometric and thermal boundary conditions 
predefined by the test section, is undertaken following the 
functional structure depicted by equation (1). 
 
Nu={Re, Ro, Bu, boundary conditions}   (1) 
 
The unknown function  is to be determined using the 
area-averaged Nu generated from the leading and trailing 
walls. The Nu variation responding to the varying parameter 
of each dimensionless parameter in equation (1) signifies the 
individual impact of the varying parameter on heat transfer. 
With the present Tb in the range of 29.1-45.5
0
C, the maximum 
variation in Prandtl number (Pr) is about 0.5%, which is 
negligible and hence the Pr effect on Nu is not examined. In 
the phase of parametric analysis, the heat transfer physics 
relevant to the Coriolis and rotating buoyancy effects are 
addressed and a set of physically consistent heat transfer 
correlations is derived. 
 
The local Nu over the scanned wall is experimentally defined 
as Nu=qfd/{kf(Tw-Tb)} in which the local convective heat flux 
(qf) is calculated by subtracting the heat loss flux from the 
total heat flux supplied to the stainless steel heating foil. The 
actual heating area, including the surface areas of all the 
spherical protrusions, is used to define the heat flux. The 
characteristics of the external heat loss are determined by 
carrying out a series of heat-loss calibration tests at five 
rotating speeds. For each heat-loss calibration test at the 
selected rotor speed, the heat loss flux is correlated as the 
function of the wall-to-ambient temperature differences 
(Tw-T∞). The proportionality between the heat loss flux and 
(Tw-T∞) increases as the rotor speed increases; and is 
correlated as the function of rotor speed. The correlation 
derived to account for the local heat loss flux is incorporated 
into the data processing program for determining the local qf. 
As the Tw distribution for each heat transfer test is not uniform, 
the distributions of heat loss flux and qf over the enhanced 
leading or trailing wall are not uniform. A review of the entire 
qf data indicates that the maximum non-uniformity for qf 
distribution is about 10.3%. Having determined the qf 
distribution over the leading and trailing walls, the streamwise 
increase of Tb is accordingly evaluated, starting from the 
measured fluid entry temperature. 
 
The experimental uncertainties for the dimensionless 
parameters summarized in equations (1) are approximated 
[23]. The temperature measurements are the major sources 
attributed to the experimental uncertainties for Nu, Re, Ro and 
Bu as all the fluid properties are temperature dependent. The 
present infrared thermal image system has the maximum 
uncertainty of +0.7K. With the pre-defined precisions for the 
measuring devices, the percentages of error for temperature 
and flow measurements are reduced at the test condition with 
the high heater power and large flow rate. As a result, the 
experimental uncertainties for Nu are generally reduced for 
the tests with high Re and high Bu. With Tw-Tb in the range of 
35-63K, the maximum uncertainties for Nu, Re, Ro and Bu are 
about 9.3%, 4.6%, 3.1% and 6.8% respectively. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Stationary channel 
With the spherical protrusions over two opposite leading and 
trailing walls, the secondary flows and the vortex shedding 
process triggered by these protrusions, as reported in [20] for 
a rectangular channel with dimples and protrusions, promote 
the HTE performance in the stationary channel. Fig. 2 depicts 
the Nu0 distributions over the protrusion-roughened wall 
where the effects of vortex shading and turbulent mixing 
considerably promote the heat transfer rates along the 
columns of the spherical protrusions. The local flow 
acceleration, triggered by the blockage effect, along with the 
separated shear layer tripped by each protrusion, generate the 
local Nu0 peak on each spherical apex. When Re increases 
from 5000-12500, the local Nu0 increases consistently and the 
high Nu0 regions along the protrusion columns on the 
roughened surface expands in the spanwise direction toward 
two sidewalls, Figs. 2(a)→(d). While the systematic Nu0 
elevation is driven by increasing Re, the Nu0 distributions 
obtained at all the tested Re are symmetrical about the axial 
centerline. Similar to the pin-fin channel [24-26], a low Nu0 
band develops alongside each channel sidewall to reflect the 
suppressed corner structures due to the increased mixing via 
the mainstream interactions with the protrusions [24] and the 
thickened sidewall boundary layers [25]. On each spherical 
protrusion as shown as the zoomed Nusselt number scan 
under each plot of Fig. 2, the heat transfer peak develops on 
top of the protrusion, reflecting the effect of the separated 
vortices tripped at the apex of each protrusion. Without the 
action of Coriolis forces, the downstream advection of these 
vortices, which serve as the major HTE mechanism in the 
present channel, is centralized along the channel centerline by 
the sidewall effects, resulting in the high Nusselt number 
region along the channel centerline, Fig.2.

Fig. 4 Nu distributions over leading and trailing walls at 
Re=5000, Ro= .4 with two different Bu. 
While the trailing Nu are consistently higher than the leading 
counterparts as a typical Coriolis force effect by generating 
the Coriolis secondary flows and modifying the local 
turbulent structures, the patterns of Nu distributions on the 
leading and trailing walls are different and varied from the 
Nu0 patterns typified by Fig. 2. Over the leading wall, the high 
Nu bumps emerge along the axial central region with the 
overall axial Nu elevation from the Nu0 levels at Ro=0.4, Figs. 
4(a)(b). On the trailing wall, the overall axial Nu increase 
from Nu0 is similarly observed but the high Nu region 
develops at the flow exit region, Figs. 4(c)(d). Clearly, the 
vortical flows tripped by the surface protrusions interact 
locally with the flow mechanisms triggered by the Coriolis 
force in the complex manners to create the different patterns 
of Nu distributions over the leading and trailing walls and 
from those in the stationary channel. In addition to these 
different heat transfer performances over the leading and 
trailing walls, the local Nu peaks still develop on the apexes of 
these spherical protrusions on both leading and trailing walls 
to reflect the local HTE effect generated by the spherical 
protrusion. But, unlike the general streamwise Nu0 decay as 
depicted in Fig. 2(e) for the stationary channel, the local Nu 
over the trailing wall increase axially in the rotating channel at 
Ro=0.4, Figs. 4 (e). The reversed patterns of the trailing axial 
Nu profiles between the Nu results obtained at Ro=0 in Fig. 
2(e) and Ro=0.4 in Fig. 4(e) indicate the streamwise growth of 
the synergetic HTE effect generated by the Coriolis force and 
the spherical protrusions. It will be demonstrated in the later 
parametric analysis that the Coriolis force effects elevate the 
heat transfer performances from the stationary Nu0 reference 
over both leading and trailing walls at Ro=0.4. The 
area-averaged Nu over the flow region after the protrusion 
row 6, Nu , is indicated on each individual plot of Fig. 
4(a)-4(d) in order to compare with the stationary 0Nu  
counterparts so that the influence of rotation on the 
area-averaged heat transfer performance can be determined as 
Nu / 0Nu . The cross examination between the various Nu  in 
Figs. 4(a)-(d) and the 0Nu  in Fig. 2(a) for Re=5000 confirms 
the improved heat transfer performances from the stationary 
condition over both the leading and trailing walls at Ro=0.4. 
 
At Ro=0.4; while the trailing-to-leading Nu differences are 
evident due to the Coriolis force effects, the Nu increase from 
Nu0 on both leading and trialing walls have been attributed to 
the large scale roll-cells over the cross sectional plane of a 
rotating channel as a result of the Taylor-Görtler instabilities 
[27,28]. Such large scale roll-cell vortices, emerging at high 
rotation rates inside the smooth-walled rotating channels 
[27,28], are also reported by the numerical simulation at the 
location near the stable wall of the rotating rib-roughened 
channel [29], which lead to the heat transfer elevation from 
Nu0 on the stable wall at high rotation numbers. Therefore the 
large scale roll-cells are likely to be generated in the present 
rotating channel at Ro=0.4. As compared between Figs. 4(a), 
4(b) and Figs. 4(c), 4(d), the increase of Bu improves local Nu 
and Nu  over both the leading and trailing walls. But the 
characteristic patterns of Nu distributions over the leading and 
trailing walls are not modified by varying Bu. Due to the 
combined Ro and Bu effects, Nu levels along the trailing 
centerline are consistently higher than their leading 
counterparts at each Bu tested, Fig. 4(e). With the presence of 
the combined Coriolis and rotating buoyancy effect in the 
rotating channel, the Nu distributions over both leading and 
trailing walls still remain symmetrical about their axial 
centerlines, Figs. 4(a)-4(e). Due to such symmetrical Nu 
distributions for all the rotational results, the Nu distributions 
over the axial regions of 0<x/w<0.5 on the leading wall and 
over the axial region of 0.5<x/w<1 on the trailing wall are 
combined into one plot for the direct comparison. 
 
Figures 5(a)-(e) compare the Nu distributions between the 
leading and trailing walls at Ro= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 with 
Re=5000. The area-averaged density ratios, β(Tw-Tb), over the 
leading and trailing walls for each plot compared in Fig. 5 are 
selected at the similar value.

distributions over the leading and trailing walls, the 
parametric analysis is performed to analyze the area-averaged 
heat transfer performances with the attempt to devise the heat 
transfer correlations. Initially, the Nu  evaluated from each 
rotating test condition is normalized by the 0Nu  obtained at 
the same Re. The isolation of Re effect from the impacts of Ro 
and Bu on Nu / 0Nu  is testified by examining the various 
Nu / 0Nu  obtained at different Re but with a fixed Ro. The 
converged data band of Nu / 0Nu  obtained with different Re at 
a fixed Ro can verify the assumption that the isolation of Re 
impact from the rotational influence is permissible by 
presenting the heat transfer data in terms of Nu / 0Nu . Fig. 7 
depicts the variations of Nu / 0Nu  against Ro at all the Re and 
Bu tested. As shown in Fig. 7, for both the leading and trailing 
walls, the tight Nu / 0Nu  band at each fixed Ro is evident. At 
the tested Ro of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15 or 0.2 with Re ranging from 
5000 to 12500, each tight Nu / 0Nu  band at the fixed Ro 
consists of 16 data points which deem to be driven by the 
various Bu rather than Re. This result suggests that the 
Nu / 0Nu  treatment enables the isolation of Re effect from the 
Ro and Bu impacts on Nu / 0Nu . The functional structure of Re 
exponent in the Nu  correlation remains unchanged from the 
Re
0.587
 in 0Nu  correlation. As compared in Fig. 7, the trailing 
Nu / 0Nu  is always higher than its leading counterpart and 
above than unity, which increases consistently as Ro increases. 
For the leading wall, the Nu / 0Nu  is initially reduced from the 
stationary reference to 0.7 as Ro increases from 0 to 0.1 but is 
recovered and turns to be higher than unity as Ro>0.3. As 
compared with the other HTE devices in Fig. 7, although the 
Ro above which the leading Nu / 0Nu  starts to be increased 
with the increase of Ro and the critical Ro above which the 
leading Nu / 0Nu  becomes higher than unity vary with the 
rotating channel configurations [2-4,10,14,15], but the general 
Ro-driven Nu / 0Nu  varying trends over the stable and 
unstable walls, as typified by Fig. 7, are followed by all the 
heat transfer results collected from the various rotating 
channels. Due to the development of high Nu in the developed 
flow region as Ro>0.2, as seen in Fig. 5, the value of Ro above 
which the leading Nu / 0Nu  turns to be increased with the 
increase of Ro, as well as the critical Ro above which the 
leading Nu / 0Nu  becomes higher than unity are both lower 
than those in the rotating channels roughened by ribs, dimples 
and pin-fins [2-4,10,14,15]. Due to the same regional HTE 
effect by these spherical protrusions, the Nu / 0Nu  levels over 
the leading and trailing walls are higher than the comparable 
counterparts collected in Fig. 7. 
 
Fig. 7 Variations of Nu / 0Nu  against Ro at rotating 
channels enhanced by various HTE devices. 
 
With the Re impact de-coupled from the Ro and Bu effects, 
the Bu influences on Nu / 0Nu  at all the tested Ro are 
examined by plotting the Nu / 0Nu  data obtained with 
different Re at the same Ro against Bu. Fig. 8 shows the 
variations of Nu / 0Nu  against Bu at the fixed Ro for the 
leading and trailing walls. As seen in Fig.8, the slopes of 
Bu-driven data trends at all the tested Ro are positive. But the 
slope of each Bu-driven Nu / 0Nu  data trend shown in Fig. 8 
varies with Ro, indicating the Bu effect on Nu / 0Nu  is 
independent with Ro. Justified by the consistent linear data 
trend for each Bu-driven Nu / 0Nu  variation at each fixed Ro 
in Fig. 8, the Nu / 0Nu is proposed as equation (3) in which ψ1 
and ψ2 respectively denote the intercept at Bu=0 and the slope 
for each Bu-driven Nu / 0Nu data trend shown in Fig. 8. 
 
Nu / 0Nu  = ψ1 + ψ2 × Bu     (3) 
 
ψ1 and ψ2 in equation (3) are functions of Ro and represent the 
Nu / 0Nu  value at the so-called zero-buoyancy condition [Ro≠0, 
β(Tw-Tb)=0)] and the interdependent Ro-Bu effect on Nu / 0Nu  
respectively.

Fig. 8 Variations of Nu / 0Nu  against Bu at fixed Ro for 
(a) leading (b) trailing walls. 
 
Clearly, as depicted in Fig. 8, the zero-buoyancy Nu / 0Nu  (ψ1) 
and the degree of the Bu impact on Nu / 0Nu  featured by ψ2 
vary with Ro, which can be readily examined by plotting ψ1 
and ψ2 against Ro. This is shown by Fig. 9 where the 
variations of ψ1 and ψ2 against Ro are respectively displayed. 
The varying manner of ψ1 against Ro is indicative of the 
individual Coriolis force effect on heat transfer. As shown in 
Fig. 9, the zero-buoyancy Nu / 0Nu  value (ψ1) increases 
consistently over the trailing wall; but reduces initially over 
the leading wall as Ro increases. The further increase of Ro 
from 0.1 results in the heat transfer recovery over the leading 
 15 
 
15 
Nu / 0Nu  is initially reduced from unity to 0.7 as Ro 
increases from 0 to 0.1 but is recovered and turns to be 
higher than unity as Ro>0.3. While the Bu effect 
improves the heat transfer performances over the rotating 
leading and trailing walls, the degree of Bu impact on 
Nu / 0Nu  decreases as Ro increases, indicating the 
interdependent Ro and Bu effect on Nu / 0Nu . 
3. A set of Nu / 0Nu  correlations for leading and trailing 
walls are generated as equations (4) and (5) to permit the 
evaluation of the individual and independent Re, Ro and 
Bu effects on Nu / 0Nu  for the present rotating channel 
with its two opposite leading and trailing walls roughened 
by the spherical protrusions.
