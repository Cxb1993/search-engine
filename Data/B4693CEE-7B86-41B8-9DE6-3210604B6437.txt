一、前言 
自然界生物體上擁有各式各樣奧秘功能的微/奈米結構，研究、模仿並進而製作
出這些特徵結構，一直是學術界及工程界的夢想。文獻研究中最具盛名的蓮花效應，
即是於荷葉表面具有許多細小不同尺寸的突起物(尺寸約數微米)。這些突起物使荷
葉表面成為超疏水性，接觸角超過 150度，水滴在荷葉上形成幾近球型水珠；接觸
面積小，可於葉面輕易滾動，而且於滾動時會一併帶走沾附於表面之灰塵，藉由此
效應使得蓮花出淤泥而不染。近年許多研究團隊均對於這種超疏水性結構進行探
討，希望能製出這些細微結構，使成品能具自我清潔功能，如建築物、衣物和太陽
能電池板等。  
2008年 Nano Technology 期刊報導指出，蟬的翅膀結構，主要是由無數的柱狀
結構組成，此柱狀結構的主要特徵是「複層」結構－在直徑較粗的柱子上另有一層
直徑較小的柱子(大柱子 150 nm，小柱子 60 nm，週期 195 nm，深度 390 nm)。此特
殊結構可使蟬翅膀具有抗沾黏效果，因為蟬在飛行途中若不慎沾附小灰塵或小水
滴，會使牠重心不穩而影響飛行安全，而此結構能讓牠飛行安穩無虞。 
2008年 Nano Technology 期刊另一篇報導，昆蟲的複眼(Compound eyes)結構，
主要是一個直徑約 1.2 mm 曲面眼球，其上佈滿著直徑約 21 µm、高度 9 µm 的微透
鏡(Micro lens)，由於這些微透鏡能同時感受到四面八方，察覺幾乎所有方向來的光
線，視角可廣達 141 度(Wide-viewing-angle)；且微透鏡上擁有次波長週期性抗反射
(Anti-reflection, AR)結構，此種抗反射結構週期大約為 350±42 nm;高度約為 120  
nm。當光波通過時，因折射率漸變，反射率會大幅下降。這種大自然之奇妙安排，
可幫助牠們及早發現及躲避天敵之攻擊威脅。  
緣此，本專題計畫提出仿生運用構想，擬模仿生物複層結構，致力於研製曲面
複層微/奈米結構，及其光學元件應用研究。其中，曲面複眼結構將應用在導光板的
入光處。入光上可同時擁有「複眼微透鏡結構(增大發散角，用來擴大光線的擴散效
果)」及  「次波長抗反射結構(增加入光效率，用來提高光耦合效率)」，可有效利用
發光。其次，蟬之翅膀特殊結構，我們擬應用在球/柱面透鏡之光學與表面超疏水性
結構研究上。在光學透鏡元件之上，其上覆蓋有奈米級抗反射結構，此結構同時具
有超疏水性之特性抗塵及自我清潔。具體應用在現行手機之照相鏡頭上，解決鏡頭
易受塵污染之問題，並超越目前折射光學元件之設計。  
導光板應用光學元件研究旨在解決現行 LED type 導光板入口之亮度不均問
題。由於全球環保意識的高漲，及顯示器考量省電、發光效率、輕薄短小化等因素，
傳統導光板所用之冷陰極管(Cold CathodeFluorescent Lamp, CCFL)光源已逐漸被淘
汰，取而代之的是以發光二極體 LED(Light-Emitting Diode)作為光源。LED光源之
優點為發光效率高、色彩飽和度充足。但 LED屬於「點光源」，相較於傳統的 CCFL
線光源，點光源的確較難以轉變成均勻線光源，也影響後續藉由導光板轉換成均勻
面光源機構。因此，環顧目前之 LED背光模組，常發現光源處附近亮暗不均勻問題。
如何將點光源轉變成為均勻線光源，再經由導光板的圖案設計轉變成為均勻面光
源，一直是當前導光板業者亟待解決的命題。  
針對 LED type導光板入口設計做全盤審視後，發現影響整體導光板光線均勻分
佈的第一道關卡，是在導光板入口處的圖案設計。吾人認為若延續以往的慣用模式，
其結果將很難跳脫亮暗不均宿命，並且增加導光板圖案(Pattern)設計的難度。且導光

ABSTRACT 
Two EDFs with different radiation sensitivities were used in the photo-annealing tests. We compared photo-annealing 
efficiencies obtained by using 532 nm and 976 nm lasers. The 532 nm laser with 10 mW showed better efficiency than 
976 nm laser with 290 mW in a ~30 cm EDF. The recovery rate was 5.6 seconds of the half-height recovery time. The 
532 nm laser possibly excited the defects and provided some thermal energy so that the defects could be recovered. The 
annealing efficiency from using the 976 nm laser was close to the one purely from thermal annealing at ~330 ℃. For 
practical tests, we also built two SPB SFSs and a bidirectional SFS and measured the output power loss dependence on 
pump power. Under the dose rate of 129.2 krad/hr, the recovery rate of output power loss was 0.009 dB/min when a 2.8 
m EDF#1 co-pumped by both the 532 nm and the 976 nm lasers.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Erbium doped fibers (EDFs) have become one of main devices utilized in optical communication and sensing. When 
employed for various applications, EDFs show good performance and stability except in radiation environments, such as 
for space or nuclear reactor applications. It has been known that the radiation induced loss (RIL) would severely degrade 
the performance of an EDF-based device. The induced loss effects are due to the optical absorption bands of the radiation 
induced defects. To reduce or eliminate these absorption bands, various methods have been reported to recover the 
defects such as thermal annealing1, material doping, hydrogen pre-loading2, and photo-annealing3. It might need to take 
more than 300 ℃ over several hours for thermal annealing to reduce RIL. Many devices could not undergo such a high 
temperature treatment. The material doping method could often deteriorate the performance of EDF devices. The 
hydrogen pre-loading method needs a hermetic coating to avoid out-diffusion of hydrogen, and its fabrication process 
might be complicated. The photo-annealing method may offer a practical way to reduce RIL, but not many works have 
been reported. Here we report the effects of photo-annealing for an EDF-based light source by using lasers of different 
wavelengths when applied in a γ-irradiation environment. 
 
2. EXPERIMENT 
Two EDFs used in this test are listed in Table 1. EDF#1 was irradiated up to 129.2 krad, and EDF#2 223.8 krad. Both 
EDFs were stored at room temperature for 5.5 months. After such long time, their unstable radiation defects were almost 
annealed. Because RIL and the absorption of erbium ions were several to tens decibel per meter, an EDF should be short 
so that the changes of absorption spectrum could be measured. Therefore, each EDF was set about 30 cm long. Two 
lasers of 976 nm and 532 nm in wavelength were used for photo-annealing tests. The reasons were that we observed an 
obvious photo-annealing effect by using a 976 nm laser in our previous work4 and high power 976 nm light could excite 
the erbium ions to produce green fluorescent light which could anneal the defects. We observe the possible lasers powers 
were available powers of our lasers, which were 290 mW and 10 mW for 976 nm and 532 nm, respectively. Each EDF

mW 532 nm laser light (b) at 0 ℃ and (c) at the room temperature. 
 
To verify the effect of photo-annealing by using the 532 nm laser, two samples of EDF#2 were photo-annealed by 532 
nm laser at 0 ℃ and thermal-annealed at high temperature, respectively. From the calculation of the heat transfer by 
using a program built in MATLAB, if the core of the EDF was heated by the laser induced phonons, the temperature in 
the core would be cooled down to ~18 % in the 0 ℃ water, for example 300 ℃ would be down to 55 ℃ in the core. Also, 
for comparison, we heated the EDF to ~330 ℃ by an increment of 50 ℃ in a step without external laser light. Thus, we 
could observe whether the excitation effect or thermal-annealing by the phonons that the 532 nm laser mainly caused. 
Fig 3 shows the results of RIL recovery of EDF#2 samples at three different conditions. The data are also fitted by the 
n-th order kinetics and the fitting parameters are shown in Table 2. We found that the thermal-annealing rapidly started 
when the temperature was up to ~330 ℃. This temperature dependence effect was also observed in single mode fibers1. 
According to the model in Reference 5, the trapped radiation induced defects were thermally activated above the 
mobility edge and recombined. The thermal-annealing could totally reduce RIL from 900 nm to 1600 nm, and its 
half-height lifetime of the recovery was 1432 seconds which was slightly faster than the photo-annealing by the 976 nm 
laser with 290 mW. If we tried to reduce the thermal effect from the photo-annealing by the 532 nm laser, the annealing 
effect seemed to limit at ~2.1 dB/m. The half-height lifetimes of the recovery were similar at 0 ℃ and the room 
temperature. This indicates that the 532 nm laser has significant annealing effect which is different with 
thermal-annealing. This annealing effect might induce excitation of some particular defects, for example, NBOHC. 
However, more energy power is needed to recover those deeply trapped defects above the mobility edge so that RIL from 
900 nm to 1600 nm can be completely reduced. In a practical test, we built up two single-pass backward (SPB) 
superfluorescent fiber sources (SFSs) by using EDF#1 and EDF#2. Both EDFs were 7 m long. We only let EDF under 
γ-ray irradiation. The dose rate was 129.2 krad/hr. In the tests, the pump power of 976 nm laser was varied at 100 mW, 
200 mW, and 290 mW. The output power loss was almost linear when the pump power was fixed. Therefore, we could 
observe the output power loss dependence on pump power. The results are listed in Table 3. As expected, the output 
power loss was lower when the pump power was higher and the photo-annealing was more significant. It was obvious 
that the higher pump power could make the rear EDF receive more pump light and the photo-annealing effect was 
stronger. EDF#1 was doped with higher Al and La concentration to enhance its pumping efficiency and linewidth. 
However, these two doping materials were reported as radiation sensitive elements. The results of the photo-annealing by 
the 532 nm and 976 nm lasers indicate that the radiation sensitivity of EDF#1 could be reduced by bidirectional pumping

Measurement of Refractive Index Profiles Variation along a 
Fusion-splicing Tapered Optical Fiber

ABSTRACT 
The assumption that a tapered fiber core diameter shrinks down as the same ratio to the cladding diameter was 
examined by observing the refractive index profiles variation along the fiber. How small the cladding diameter be and the 
core would still exist was also examined. Refractive index profiling method based on quantitative phase microscopy 
(QPM) gives the ability to mapping the two dimensional refractive index profiles, and the tapering variation can be 
obtained from this approach. A small amount of core germanium diffusion was observed, which suggests the non-ideal 
fact of the core/cladding diameter ratio. The core can still be resolved when the cladding diameter is down to ~10µm, 
proving the existence of the core down to this scale.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Optical fiber sensors have been used in different technological fields. Among the various types of fiber sensors, 
fiber-taper-based sensors are one of the simplest kinds, as they do not need expensive measurement devices or complex 
fabrication procedure. In the theory of tapered fiber, taper angle and taper waist determine the mode coupling and mode 
numbers of the sample.1,2 Typically the core diameter is assumed to shrink down as the same ratio to the cladding 
diameter, and the refractive index difference between core and cladding (∆ncore-clad) is unchanged. However, for the case 
of smaller size taper waist or a sub-micron fiber, the core is typically assumed to be vanished and the light is guided by 
air-cladding, which implies a larger evanescent field for higher sensing sensitivity. 3,4,5 It seems that there must be a 
gradual variation from the original 125µm diameter fiber to the taper waist region. In this paper, we use a bright-field 
microscope imaging method for fiber refractive index profiling 6, based on quantitative phase microscopy (QPM) 7 which 
has been recently proved to be a robust, straightforward, nondestructive technique for refractive index profile 
measurements. One of the advantages of this method to examine tapered fiber is that it can be profiled continuously, 
since the imaging-based method provides the capability of mapping of the refractive index profiles. Previous work was 
made based on cleaved fiber end face followed by hydrofluoric acid etching and atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
measurement.8 Although AFM could provide high spatial resolution, it could not be used to examine the continuous 
variation along a fiber, which implies the need of preparation of many samples and obviously impractical.  
 
2. METHOD 
The refractive index profiling method is based on Reference 6, which uses the transverse phase gradient instead of 
phase gradient in original QPM method. After the transverse phase gradient is obtained, the refractive index profile    
∆n(r) can be calculated directly by the inverse Abel transform:

To observe the tapered fiber variation along the fiber axis, a set of images (in-focus and defocus) were taken from the 
region where tapering started, and then the microscope stage was moved along the fiber axis for the same distance as the 
image height (~100µm) and the next set of images was taken. The steps were repeated until the whole taper region was 
all examined, and the images corresponding to different regions along the tapered fiber axis were utilized to calculate the 
refractive index profiles by the algorithms.  
 
Fig. 2 is a typical defocus image of the tapered fiber, and Fig. 3 is the corresponding refractive index profile focused 
on the core region. The tapering of the core can be clearly resolved, and the averaged index difference between core and 
cladding (∆ncore-clad) is about 0.006, close to the standard value of the original untapered single-mode fiber.

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are the core regions’ refractive index profiles of the thinner part of the tapered fiber. In Fig. 4, the 
core can still be clearly resolved; however, in Fig. 5 the core gradually disappears where the core diameter is smaller than 
1µm and becomes hardly resolved by optical microscope. When compared Fig. 3 to Fig. 5, it is noted that the gradually 
tapering variation can be examined. Furthermore, the gradual lowering of ∆ncore-clad along the fiber axis can be clearly 
observed. The lowering of ∆ncore-clad implies lower germanium concentration in the core, since germanium was the main 
dopants in a typical single-mode fiber to determine ∆ncore-clad. This result suggests that germanium may diffuse out during 
the fusion splicing process provided by the locally high temperature, and the core may expand slightly rather than the 
ideal equal-shrinking-ratio of core/cladding diameter. Similar results may be found in Reference 8, which also indicated 
germanium diffusion and the core profile redistribution.

ABSTRACT 
The performance of an FOG using a DPB SFS in a laboratory environment is reported, and compared with the one 
using an SPB SFS. The result shows that the DPB SFS has a larger linewidth and a higher pump efficiency than the SPB 
one. When measuring the earth rotation rate, the FOG using the DPB SFS has lower random noise and smaller bias drift 
(0.019 deg/¥h and 0.18 deg/h) than that using the SPB SFS (0.023 deg/¥h and 0.47 deg/h). If a DPB SFS was applied in 
the space, its output loss due to radiation damage could be smaller than an SPB one because a DPB SFS used a shorter 
EDF so that the total radiation induced loss is reduced.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The operation of an interferometric fiber-optic gyroscope (IFOG) is based on the Sagnac effect, which creates a phase 
shift proportional to the rotation rate. The requirements of light sources for the inertial-navigation grade IFOG are 
broadband, high power, and highly stable mean wavelength. A broader spectrum linewidth reduces errors due to 
coherence effects such as Rayleigh backscattering, polarization fluctuations, Faraday effect and nonlinear Kerr effect1, 
and enhances the sensitivity of IFOG owing to lower excess noise2. High output power improves signal to noise ratio. 
Additionally, stable mean wavelength determines the accuracy of the IFOG’s scale factor3. An Erbium-doped 
superfluorescent fiber source (SFS) which has been developed in nearly past twenty years meets the characteristics 
described above. There are four classical configurations of SFS4, i.e. single-pass forward (SPF), single-pass backward 
(SPB), double-pass forward (DPF), and double-pass backward (DPB) configurations. The SPB configuration has been 
widely used in an FOG because of its simple configuration and stable performance. However, the DPB configuration 
provides better pump efficiency, larger linewidth, and also small mean wavelength dependence of pump power. 
Additionally, when the two sources are optimally designed, the DPB configuration always needs shorter EDF. Therefore 
a DPB SFS may be considered as a good candidate light source for FOG to be utilized in a satellite deployed in radiation 
hazard space. This work shows the performance comparison between a SPB and a DPB SFS performance in a homemade 
fiber-optic gyroscope, and the results indicates that the FOG using a DPB SFS has better performance with lower random 
noise and bias drift. 
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
A simple all-fiber open-loop depolarized configuration was built in the lab, as shown in Fig. 1. A 3.4 km single mode 
fiber coil in 0.15 m diameter, not arranged in any special winding, was used in the FOG. The light sources were 
Er-doped SFSs which were configured in SPB or DPB. An electro-optic type phase modulator was input with square 
wave, and the proper frequency of the gyroscope was set 29.7 KHz. A polarizer with high extinction ratio of 55dB was 
used to minimize unwanted polarization mode. There were three Lyot-type depolarizers used in the FOG. One was put in 
front of the coupler and the others were connected to the sensing loop5. The depolarizers were fabricated by splicing two 
polarization maintaining fiber with length ratio of 1:2 whose birefringence axes were turned by 45° with respect to each 
other6. There should be some polarization coupling in the loop because the sensing coil was not polarization maintain 
pump power was also less than 10 ppm/mW. Because the mirror could reflect the forward ASE, the pump efficiency was 
larger. When the pump power was 290 mW, the output power was ~47 mW. The photodetector was InGaAs PIN type, 
and the received power level was about hundreds of microwatts. Because the DPB SFS had lager output power and 
linewidth, the angle random walk (ARW) of an FOG could be smaller than when using the SPB SFS.

3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The whole FOG system was put on the shockproof table, and the coil axis was perpendicular to the ground. The 
vertical earth rotation rate in Taipei was about 6.3 deg/h. A lock-in amplifier time constant was set to 1 second and its 
low pass filter was set to 12 dB/Octave. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 showed earth rate measurements when the SPB and DPB SFS 
were used respectively. It indicates that the FOG utilizing DPB configuration has better performance. The FOG using the 
DPB SFS had lower random noise and bias drift than SPB FOG. The reason was that the DPB SFS had larger linewidth 
which could reduce coherence errors and polarization errors.

ABSTRACT 
We demonstrate a new method that could make possible the mass production of symmetric and asymmetric corrugated 
long period fiber gratings (C-LPFG) by utilizing hot embossing and imprint lithography on polycarbonate (PC). The 
asymmetric C-LPFGs show some unique optical characteristics of two separate loss dips due to their asymmetric 
structures. A C-LPFG was well packaged by fixing itself in the PC and having some open area close to the fiber core to 
receive the liquid under test. The packaged refractive index sensor has a sensitivity of 26.7 nm/RIU.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Due to the cladding mode’s dependence on the local environment, long period fiber gratings (LPFGs) are suitable as 
sensors for the measurement of temperature, strain, torsion, and refractive index etc1,2. Many methods have been reported 
for the fabrication of LPFGs such as UV exposure, focused laser beam3, electric arc4, and ion implantation5. In a 
previous work, we first metal coated to form a periodic pattern on a fiber, and then used hydrofluoric acid to have the 
fiber etched to become corrugated. Though tedious in the processing, such an LPFG showed unique characteristics when 
mechanical forces were applied6. 
Here we report another method by the use of hot embossing and imprint lithography to fabricate LPFGs. Compared 
with the previous one, this fabrication method may reduce much time and cost. We also report some characteristics of an 
asymmetric LPFG made by this method. Finally, a well-packaged refractive index sensor is introduced to show the 
sensing ability of the C-LPFG. 
2. NEW FABRICATION METHOD OF C-LPFGS 
Hot embossing process is a production method for massively generating micro-structures at low cost. Identical structures 
can be duplicated over a large area by using this method. Fig. 1 shows the process for hot embossing optical fibers on 
amorphous polycarbonate (PC). It is noted that the embossed depth was controlled by temperature, pressure and time. 
The embossed depth is an important parameter which controls the degree of protection against HF etching. In other 
words, the asymmetry of C-LPFGs depends on the degree of protection. By using the hot embossing method, we could 
control the asymmetry of C-LPFGs. 
We used polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as an elastomer mold to achieve conformal contact with surface. Fig. 2(a) 
shows the diagram of the imprint process. PC was heated to well above its softening temperature and then PDMS was 
imprinted on it. The fiber was forced by PDMS to sink into the PC melt. An optical microscope photograph of the 
corrugated structure fabricated by the imprint lithography process is shown in Fig. 2(b). The revealed region of the fiber 
was ready for etching. 
Hydrofluoric acid (HF) was used to etch the fiber cladding in the uncovered regions. The asymmetry might not sustain 
well due to the material difference between fiber and PC that HF could permeate into the interface of the two to make it 
symmetric. Finally, the substrate was immersed in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to dissolve the PC and thus we could obtain 
C-LPFGs. The optical microscope photograph of an asymmetric C-LPFG is shown in Fig. 3. 
asymmetric C-LPFG under torsion forces. It is shown that the resonant wavelength remains unchanged below some 
critical twist rate, and then varies linearly beyond that rate. 
 
 
4. FABRICATION OF PACKAGED C-LPFGS AS REFRACTIVE INDEX SENSORS 
It is expected that the C-LPFG is capable of sensing the refractive index of liquid which covers the corrugated region. It 
is noted that a C-LPFG needs to be specially packaged to sustain enough mechanical strength when placed under tension. 
A PC plate covers most part of the C-LPFG, but leaves a small place to allow liquid to be filled in the corrugated region. 
A few drops of liquid will suffice without the need of a container. 
Ethanol solutions with different volume percentage were applied for index measurement. The shift of resonant 
wavelengths is shown in Fig. 6(a). With the solution concentration increasing from 0% to 99.99%, the resonant 
wavelength shifts to the shorter side. Fig. 6(b) shows the relationship between solution concentration and resonant 
wavelength. Accompanying to the growth of the ethanol solution concentration, the refractive index of the solution and 
then that of cladding will increase8. It will be linear due to the characteristic of C-LPFG itself and the sensitivity of 26.7 
nm/RIU can be obtained from the linear fitting. From the equation of the resonance wavelength of the C-LPFG7 
                                      (1) 
where Λ is the period of the C-LPFG,  and  the effective index of fiber core and averaged effective index of 
fiber cladding, respectively.  and  represent the self coupling coefficient of core mode and averaged self 
coupling coefficient of cladding mode and change slightly to be regarded as a constant. Therefore, it can be understood 
why the resonant wavelength shifts to the shorter side as the effective index of cladding increase.
