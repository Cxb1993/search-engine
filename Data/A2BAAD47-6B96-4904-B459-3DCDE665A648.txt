Abstract 
   The air exchanges between rooms and a 
long, internal corridor yield poor ventilation 
between corridor and rooms, even the room 
has an open window on the opposite wall. 
This research conducted a series of wind 
tunnel experiments to investigate the 
wind-driven ventilation of buildings with an 
internal corridor. The exchange rate 
between room and corridor was measured 
by the tracer gas technique. The influences 
of external wind speed, the sizes of opening 
and wind speed in the corridor was studied. 
The experimental results were analyzed to 
develop a predictive model for the 
concentration change in the corridor. In 
addition, means to improve the corridor 
ventilation were examined in this study. 
This model can provide the architects to 
evaluate the ventilation rate and thermal 
comfort of buildings with corridor. 
 
Keywords: Corridor ventilation, Tracer gas 
technique, Wind tunnel experiment  
 
1. Introduction 
 Many buildings, such as hotel, 
dormitory, classroom and hospital, have a 
long interior corridor (hallway) as shown in 
Fig. 1.  The air flow exchange between 
corridor and adjacent rooms plays a vital 
role in determining the indoor environment 
and energy use of the buildings (Gratia et al., 
2004).  Several studies (Lidwell, 1975; 
Menzies et al., 2003) have pointed out that 
the ventilated corridor is the main pathway 
for transporting of airborne materials in 
hospitals.  Luther and Ilozor (2003) studied 
the natural ventilation and associated 
thermal comfort of a building comprising of 
a central corridor with rooms to either side 
fronting an external operable window.  
Door grilles were used to allow for air 
exchange between hallway and rooms.  
They also analyzed ventilation performance 
under various external conditions.  Becker 
et al. (2007) investigated the effects of

 Before the start of the experiment, all 
the openings on the scale model were sealed.  
Tracer gas was injected into the model, and 
then a small mixing fan inside the model 
was turned on for 2 minutes to mix the 
tracer gas inside the model. Next, the mixing 
fan was turned off and the wind tunnel fan 
was turned on. After several minutes, the 
opening (or openings) on the model was 
opened to start the sampling procedure. The 
sampling procedure took about 15 - 40 min, 
depending on the flow rate.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
 Fig. 4 shows the experimental setup of 
the corridor ventilation. The windward and 
leeward sides of the model each have one 
opening (A1 = A2 = 5 cm x 10 cm).  The 
leeward opening is connected to the corridor.  
When a person enter the room from the 
corridor, the door angle β > 0 is defined as 
pushing the door, and door angle β < 0 is 
defined as pulling the door.  The door 
angle includes β = 22.5o, 45o, 67.5o, 90o, 
-22.5o, -45o, -67.5o, -90o.  External wind 
speed U = 0.  The cross-sectional area of 
the corridor Ad = 40 cm x 13 cm, with one 
side of the corridor was sealed, and the other 
side was completely open.   
 The internal pressure Pr and corridor 
pressure Pc were measured by the pressure 
scanner, and the flow rate was measured the 
nozzle meter.  The discharge coefficient Cd 
can be calculated by the orifice equation, 
given that the pressure difference, opening 
area and ventilation rate are known.   
 The discharge coefficient Cd is plotted 
as a function of Reynolds number Re in Fig. 
6-12.  As can be seen, the discharge 
coefficient Cd is independent of the 
Reynolds number when Re > 10000, but 
increased as the door angle β increased from 
0o to +90o or -90o.  The discharge 
coefficient Cd decreased as the door angle β 
closer to 0o. Fig. 6 and 7 depict the 
discharge coefficients of door angle 
β > 0 and β < 0  respectively.  The results 
indicate that the discharge coefficient Cd is 
the same for the inhale or exhale conditions. 
Fig. 8 shows the relationship between the 
discharge coefficients and Reynolds number 
for door angle β < 0.   Τhe nozzle meter 
exhale air into the room. It is called 
single-sided when one lateral opening of the 
corridor was open and another opening was 
sealed, while two lateral openings of the 
corridor was open is defined as two-side.  
It appears that the discharge coefficient Cd 
of single-side and two-side openings are the 
same. Fig. 9 compares the discharge 
coefficient Cd of door angle β = +90o, -90o 
and no door.  It suggests that the discharge 
coefficients Cd of door angle β = +90o, -90o 
(Cd = 0.567, 0.604) are slightly smaller than 
that of no door (Cd = 0.628). This indicates 
that part of airflow was obstructed by the 
door.  Fig. 10 shows the discharge 
coefficient Cd for door angle β = +67.5o and 
-67.5o, the discharge coefficient Cd = 0.512.  
The discharge coefficient Cd = 0.397 for 
door angle β = +45o and -45o (see Fig. 11).  
Fig. 12 illustrates the discharge coefficient 
Cd = 0.24 for door angle β = +22.5o and 
-22.5o.  Fig. 13 shows the relationship 
between the average discharge coefficient 
Cd and door angle β.   
 Figs. 14-17 show the concentration 
decay in the corridor for Cases 1 - 4.  
Before the start of the experiment, all the 
openings on the room were sealed.  Tracer 
gas was injected into the room.  Initial 
concentration inside the room was 400 ppm.  
After several minutes, the opening (or 
openings) on the room was opened and the 
sampling procedure start.  The sampling
