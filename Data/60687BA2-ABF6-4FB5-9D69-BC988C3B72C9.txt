the substrate like Fig. 1. The deposition angle for the sample holders are 0o and from 40o 
to 85o with 5o interval. All of these sample holders can be attached to the plate once. By 
this special holder, thin films with different deposition angle can be fabricated once. The 
photo of specific holder is also shown in Fig. 1. 
Quartz crystal is used to monitor deposition rates. The quartz crystal oscillates at a 
resonance frequency that is dependant on the thickness and mass of the film deposited 
onto it. We can get the deposition rate and deposition thickness by quartz crystal 
monitor. For position of sample in holder we used is different from position of sample in 
origin holder in e-beam system and different position of sample could affect the 
deposition rate and deposition thickness, the ratio between thickness of deposition 
sample and quartz crystal monitor should be measured. The ratio between thickness of 
deposition sample and quartz crystal monitor or so-called tooling factor is 
 tooling factor = thicknessmeasured/thicknessmonitor        (1) 
where thicknessmeasured means the thickness of thin film with deposition angle 0o and 
thicknessmonitor means thickness displayed by quartz crystal monitor. 
Different deposition materials have different tooling factors. In our experiment, 
indium tin oxide (ITO) is used. The tooling factor for ITO we measured is about 0.67. 
By the tooling factor, we can control the thickness of deposition more precisely.

Table 1 Parameter of deposition ITO thin films 
After deposition, thermal annealing is applied in clean dry air (CDA) and N2 
atmosphere at different temperature from 500oC to 700oC in 1 min to improve the 
transparency of the nanoporous thin films. Rapid thermal annealing MILA3000 is used 
for the thermal annealing. 
Optical properties of ITO nanoporous thin films 
In our experiment, the optical properties of nanoporous thin films such as 
transmittance and refractive index are measured. Effects of different annealing 
parameters would also be discussed in this section. 
Transparency of ITO nanoporous thin film 
ITO thin films deposited by e-beam have low transparency. It is because that ITO 
atoms reach surface of substrate with low kinetic energy and can only diffuse for short 
distance. Crystalline structure of ITO could not be formed and only amorphous 
structure is formed [3]. With amorphous structure, ITO has band gap lower than visible 
light that would absorbed incident visible photons. Besides, oxygen in ITO structure 
would loss for the amorphous structure. It would absorb incident photons and make
