2Abstract
To be one of effective delivery of anticancer therapeutic agents must rely on macromolecular drug
carriers because they appear to target tumors and have limited toxicity in normal tissue. However, solid
tumors consist of extreme complicated structures: a porous interstitium and a poorly organized vasculature
composed of a network of capillaries with highly permeable walls. As anticancer drugs distribute within
tumors, they form gradients from tumour blood vessels that change with time as the drug is cleared from the
body. The purpose of this study is to better understand macromolecular drug transport mechanisms within
solid tumors by numerical calculation. With integrating experimental information on dextran covalently linked
to a fluorophore in tumors, optimization scheme, mathematical modeling and numerical modeling, an
estimation scheme is proposed to predict several parameters of interest in tumour region. In the study a
one-dimensional transient solute transport equation coupled with experimental pharmacokinetics data is used.
The governing equation, which is derived from cylindrical coordinates, includes convection and diffusion
modes of transport. Applying both an optimization scheme and water-fall searching approach in the study, we
predicted macromolecular diffusivities and shifting velocities in tumour region. The results show in a good
agreement with experimental data.

1. Introduction
The neoplastic vasculature of solid tumors has significant impact on the distribution of anticancer drugs.
Investigation of drug transport phenomena within tumors is motivated by the desire to understand
macromolecular drugs in the cancer treatment. The inability to deliver adequate quantities of macromolecular
drugs to all area of solid tumors depends on many factors [1]. One of them is due to high interstitial fluid
pressure within solid tumors and it is a well recognized phenomenon. To effectively deliver drugs to all
tumorous regions is one of the most current important research issues at present [2, 3]. Most of research
groups presented studies which usually focused on experimental measurements and trials to obtain transport
properties which are used for analysis and treatment strategies. However, some of measurements were
infeasible to obtain at present technology and some of experimental trails involved complicated tumor
microenvironments that were hard to analyze. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to use
mathematical modeling and numerical modeling to assist obtaining transport properties of interested domain
and to reduce the cost of experimental procedures, predicting and accelerating outcome of results.
Rakesh K. Jain and his associates [4] used their mathematical model to gain insights of interstitial fluid
pressure (IFP) and macromolecular transport in tumors. And they confirmed in two years later after their
mathematical predictions that IFP is relatively uniform throughout the tumor and decreases precipitously in
the tumor margin. Because of this uniform IFP distribution, it implies that the convective effects would be
negligible throughout the tumor”.
The elevated IFP that contributes to a barrier to drug transport to the tumor region is one of factors in
solid tumors. Many research groups propose and suggest novel treatment strategies to overcome this issue.
Recent reviews [3] said that as anticancer drugs distribute within tumors they form gradients from tumor
blood vessels that change with time as the drug is cleared from the body. The permeability of vessel walls
43.3 kDa to 2 MDa, as dextran covalently linked to a fluorophore was administered in tumors experimentally.
The molecular weight of dextran correlates closely with their diffusivity as indicated in equation 1.
2.3 Mathematical Model
According to Fick’s first law and solute particle drift, the total flux density (or fluence rate) is the sum of
both terms which is described as
s f
C
j D r uC
r
 
 (1)
where rf is the retardation factor (it indicates the ratio of drug particles’velocity to fluid velocity and usually it
is 1.0), u is the drug particles’drifting velocity at blood vessel wall, C is the concentration of drug, D is the
diffusivity of macromolecular drug in solid tumor (assumed constant in the study) and r is radial position in
cylindrical coordinates. Dextrin of different sizes of particles is used in the study. We used dextrans with
molecular weights from 3.3 kDa to 2 MDa, as dextran covalently linked to a fluorophore was administered in
tumors experimentally.
With the theory of continuity equation ( s

 ) and conservation of mass in extravasculation and
applying Eq. 1, we are able to generate Fick’s second law, which the governing equation is expressed as

The definition of concentration is number of particles within a small control volume. It is proportional to the
unit of intensity which represents number of particles pass a small control surface. Experimental
measurements of particles use intensity and it was normalized by maximum vascular intensity. Thus we adopt
those experimental intensity measurements directly through our numerical simulations.
The concentration of drug in solid tumor depends on the intensity of drug carried in blood vessel which
is the driving force of the distribution of drug dose in solid tumor. In experimental setup, the administration
of the macromolecules was modeled as a bolus injection into a central blood compartment that was allowed to
exchange with both normal and tumor extravascular compartment and to be eliminated. Therefore we used
vascular pharmacokinetics (Fig. 4.A of the paper [18]) as boundary condition to Eq. 2 and assumed zero
concentration at the other end of boundary condition.

where rv is the radius of blood vessel and L is the location at the other end which is far away from the blood
vessel. C(t) is the driving force of drug penetrating from vascular compartment into solid tumor. The initial
condition is zero concentration in the domain of interest.

The simulator of the system equations is capable of predicting solute transport which includes two mass
transfer modes: diffusion and convection.
6where set S is defined as all selected data points for the period of 30 minutes. In this study, we take a data
point at each minute. ,expiI is the extravascular intensity at the i
th minute from experiment shown in Fig. 4.a
of [18]. ,i estI is the estimated intensity at the i
th minute from computer calculation which the estimated
intensity is the average of all location points within 35μm zone of extravascular compartment. The interval
distance among the location points is 1μm. Num(S) means total number of data points in the set S.
Therefore, we used the 30 minutes time period for the comparison. At every one minute interval we
compared the experimental data and estimated data as described by the criterion. The optimal solution reaches
when the comparison criterion value is less than 7%. Therefore iteration stops. The comparison criterion value
was chosen based on slow converging speed when approaching 10% and no significant difference on the
outcome of drug distributions at the range of 7 to 10%.
3. Results
The initial guess on drifting velocity at vessel wall is 0.1μm/s. It is based on Jain’s paper [14, 15] that
the value of fluid velocity at the periphery, for a tumor of 1 cm radius is about 0.1~0.2 μm/s, however the
value of convective velocity inside the tumor is not known. The try-and-error logical search for optimal
diffusivities and drug particles velocities for different sizes of macromolecular drug are shown in table 1.
We ran several cases of simulations and fast checked drug distribution patterns with experimental results.
Following the rule of the larger size of macromolecules, the more difficult particles can penetrate into tumor
interstitium. The purpose of this search is to first establish ranges of diffusivities and velocities for all
macromolecular sizes. It lets us to search optimal values on a smaller range of each macromolecular drug in
optimization with less computational time. To illustrate our calculated results, we compared them with
experimental results and showed them at different sizes of macromolecules in Figs. 3 and 4.
Figure 3 shows comparison of experimental apparent results and simulation results with various
macromolecular diffusivities and particles drifting velocities (by convection) for extravascular accumulation
of dextran with 3.3kDa molecular weight. The result presents relative intensity as a function of time in
extravascular compartment. The unit of diffusivities is cm2/s and that for macromolecular particles shifting
speed is µm/s. The cases of simulating transport parameters for this macromolecular drug are ({diffusivity,
drug particles shifting speed}) {1.0*10-6, 0.0}, {1.0*10-7, 0.0}, {1.0*10-6, 0.01}, {1.0*10-6, 0.05}, {7.0*10-7,
0.05}, {5.0*10-7, 0.05} and {5.0*10-7, 0.08}.
Figure 4 shows comparison of experimental apparent results and simulation results with various
macromolecular diffusivities and particles drifting velocities (by convection) for extravascular accumulation
of dextran with 2M Da molecular weights. The result presents relative intensity as a function of time in
extravascular compartment. The unit of diffusivities is cm2/s and that for macromolecular particles shifting
speed is µm/s. The cases of simulating transport parameters for this macromolecular drug are ({diffusivity,
drug particles drifting speed}) {1.0*10-9, 0.0}, {1.0*10-10, 0.0}, {5.0*10-11, 0.0}, {5.0*10-11, 0.001}, and
{5.0*10-11, 0.0011}.
After optimization scheme shown in Fig. 2, we obtained optimal diffusivities and drug particles drifting
velocity at vessel wall. According to the resultant figures in the journal paper, we presented our numerical
results in the same figure format that drug intensity as a function of the distance from vessel wall and time.
8the direction and magnitude of convection across tumor vessels were unknown in their preparation. In the
study, we assume flow moving outward to tumor interstitium and estimate drug intensity, as a function of
space, time and molecular weight, near vascular compartment. The computational results of figure 5 show in
accordance with figure 6 of journal paper [18].
