Abstract—This project analyzes the thermal deformation in SU-8 polymer materials when 
subjected to different fabricating parameters and exposed to a high power light source for 
long durations for 45° micro-mirror applications.  By experimentally optimizing the 
fabrication process, new fabricating technologies for micro-optical components can be 
developed.  During the fabrication process, a polymer-based material is subjected to 
different soft bake, post exposure bake (PEB), hard baking temperatures; also, the baking 
times and exposure dosages were varied.  Any of these variables can change the thermal 
stability of the material’s bonding energy and dynamic molecular behavior.  There have not 
been many studies on the thermal deformation of a micro-mirror structure.  A thermal 
dilatometer DIL-402C was used in this study to measure the thermal stability and determine 
changes in the material phase of SU-8 2035 material.  After optimizing the process parameters 
and finding that the inclined surface roughness was 49 nm, the thermal deformation was 
found to be 25 ppm (at 100°C).  Besides, this project tests the effect of solvent loss percentage 
of the SU-8 3035 polymer material (optimum surface roughness: 85.45% solvent remove) on the 
surface roughness of inclined surfaces.  The smallest surface roughness achieved in the 
experiments using SU-8 3035 material with a thickness of 1.4 mm was less than 34 nm (400µm

EXPERIMENT METHODS AND A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS OF 
THERMAL DEFORMATION 
The fabrication process adopted for this study is the inclined exposure technique (Hung et al. 
2004; Hung et al. 2008) (Figure 1).  The geometry dimensions of the micro-mirror are 3 mm (L) 
X 2 mm (W) X 1.4 mm (H).  The fabricated SU-8 micro-mirror was measured with dilatometer 
DIL-402C [8] find the change to the polymer material’s volume.  The platform structure and 
methodology are shown in Figure 2 (NETZSCH Company), along with the thermocouple, sample 
holder, and holding tube.  Parameters like the heating time, temperature, and stress can be 
controlled with software.  When they are heated up, the molecules begin to vibrate as if they had 
a bigger molecular radius.  During heating the mean-free-path between molecules increases, 
causing the size of material to increase as well.  The thermal expansion coefficient is related to 
the strength of the molecular bonds.  To move molecules away from their original equilibrium 
positions, materials need to be heated up.  Deeper energy troughs are created if the strength of 
molecular bonds is high, making it more difficult for molecules to leave their balanced positions.  
A smaller linear expansion coefficient means such material has a high melting point. Phase 
changes can occur when allotropic materials are heated up, while their thermal expansion 
coefficients may be anisotropic.  A parameter that describes thermal dynamic behavioral is the 
thermal expansion coefficient

Generally thermal expansion can include linear expansion, surface expansion, and volume 
expansion.  Linear expansion occurs when the length of material changes with the temperature 
in 1-dimension.  Surface and volume expansion are 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional changes, 
respectively.  For this study, we measured values like 
0L
LΔ  with a dilatometer. 
The current findings from our lab facility indicate that the thermal deformations 
associated with hard baked and non-hard baked structures are different.  As such, we can 
infer that during the manufacturing process, polymer materials subjected to different soft and 
hard bake temperatures for different durations and different exposure dosages may experience 
changes in their thermal stabilities. 
 
EXPERIMENT RESULTS 
We experimentally measured 
0L
LΔ  with a dilatometer.  The thermal expansion 
measurements of hard baked and non-hard baked structures (hardbake at 200°C, 30 mins (Hung et 
al. 2004) are as shown in Figure 3.  It can be seen from the figures that for the non-hard baked 
sample, the mirror surface experiences 3 phase changes when going from room temperature to 
200°C.  In contrast, there were only 2 phase changes for the hard-baked sample.  This finding 
shows that the thermal energy can indeed heighten the polymer material’s ability to move.  Hard 
baking at a high temperature increases the material’s ability to bond, resulting in fewer 
deformations.  We soft baked samples for 8 or 10 hours, where the materials were fabricated 
using exposure dosages of 6, 7, 8, and 10 mJ/μm2 (table 1).  Figure 4 shows the relationship 
between the temperature and thermal deformation of SU-8.  The figure shows that soft baking 
for 8 hours (No. 1, 2 and 3) produces a smaller thermal deformation than soft baking for 10 hours 
(No. 4, 5 and 6).  An excessively long soft bake will cause the photoresist or the solvent was 
reduced, affecting the exposure transmission of the molecular energy.  Then, the exposure dose

英文： Micro-optical system little to develop of manufacturing 
technology for integrating beam-splitter and other optical component. 
This project has verified that special inclined exposure technology 
could be used to fabricate polymer beam-splitter devices and therefore 
offers an alternative to conventional mechanical processing.  This 
project tests the effect of solvent loss percentage of the SU-8 3035 
polymer material (optimum surface roughness: 85.45% solvent 
remove) on the surface roughness of inclined surfaces.  The smallest 
surface roughness achieved in the experiments using SU-8 3035 
material with a thickness of 1.4 mm was less than 34 nm (400µm X 
400µm area).  After optimizing the process parameters, the thermal 
deformation was found to be 25 ppm (at 100°C). 
In comparison with optical glass, one weakness of optical plastics 
is that changes to their optical characteristics due to temperature 
changes are more pronounced.  The surface hardness of plastic optical 
components also tends to be lower than that of glass, making it easier 
to damage these components via collision or scratching.  This restricts 
the application of optical plastic components to complex and adverse 
environments.  Raising the temperature performance and surface 
hardness are two major issues associated with plastic optics.  
However, while many scholars have been able to fabricate mirror 
structures, very few explored the thermal stability of the materials.
