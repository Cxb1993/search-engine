Abstract—For the first part of the project, we developed a 
mathematical model for a typical laser printing system. The 
model integrates three of the fundamental steps, i.e., charging, 
exposure, and development, in electrophotographic process 
along with a sub-model describing the scanline spacing. 
Effectiveness of the model for predicting print images is 
verified by comparison of the simulated and actual printed 
images. The results have been documented and submitted to 
07’ International Automatic Control Conference (CACS). We 
are planning on making submission to Journal of Imaging 
Science and Technology. For the second part of the project, 
new servo control architecture was proposed for a digital color 
laser printer with under-actuated motor/gear configuration. 
The insufficiency and performance limitation of using single 
actuator (either motor or laser intensity control) for this type of 
systems is discussed first. The proposed dual-actuator control 
scheme consists of a conventional H∞  feedback controller and 
a nonlinear feedforward controller. The feedback controller 
regulates the motor velocity to reduce disturbances on the 
intermediate transfer medium, and the feedforward controller 
modulates the laser intensity to compensate for the reflectance 
variation due to the possibly amplified disturbances on the 
photoconductive drum. Experiments based on the proposed 
scheme are performed and show significant banding reduction 
on both the measured reflectance and the printed images. 
Partial results for this research have been presented in 06’ 
Asian Control Conference. Full documented results have been 
accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Control 
Systems Technology. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
LECTROPHOTOGRAPHY was first incorporated 
into a commercial product in 1959. At that time Xerox 
Corporation launched the sale of their first automatic copier 
machine (known as Xerox 915). In recent years, electronic 
document quickly gained popularity and made people 
predict that the market of printing products will gradually 
decline. Emergence of electronic document defines a new 
form of portable document, and also changes people’s 
reading habits. Many publishers or vendors now provide 
electronic copies of books or product manuals so that 
customers can read directly from their computer monitors. 
However, the need for people to print the electronic 
documents eventually drives and stimulates the sale of 
printing products. Furthermore, as the cost of hardware 
continues to drop off, a printing machine has slowly but 
surely become an indispensable electronic appliance in every 
home. After decades of progression, on-demand printing, i.e., 
printers or copiers used in the office or in the house, has 
recently become a competitive worldwide industry. For 
high-speed printing, electrophotography (EP) is the 
technology of choice, and laser printer is one of the 
well-known consumer products having EP as its kernel 
technology. 
A typical EP process constitutes six basic steps: charging, 
exposure, developing, transferring, fusing and cleaning. 
Many researchers have studied the physics and chemistry 
governing the basic steps, and have developed the 
corresponding mathematical and empirical models. For the

In general, the corotron wire will not locate exactly at the 
center of the cylinder. Nevertheless, the value of 0V  solved 
according to (1) will be close to the value of 0V  obtained 
from experiment. 
The current i  moving from the corotron wire towards 
the OPC surface can be expressed as 
 ( )0c c ci f V V V= −  (3) 
where cV  is the corotron voltage, and cf  is a function of 
ion mobility and the distance between the wire and the OPC 
surface. The current flows towards the OPC surface and 
builds up potential on the surface, which ends up decreasing 
the current. To account for this effect, (3) should be 
modified as 
 ( )( )0s c c B c Bi f V V V V V= − − −  (4) 
where si  is the current flowing towards to the OPC surface, 
and BV  is the OPC surface potential. The effect of leakage 
current can also be taken into account. Suppose that li  is 
the leakage current, which is a function of the OPC surface 
potential. Then the effective current ai  becomes 
 a s li i i= −  (5) 
Equation (5) can be further rewritten as 
 ( )( ) ' 20a c c B c B Bi f V V V V V BV= − − − −  (6) 
where 'B  is a function of the thickness of photoconductive 
material on the OPC surface and the area that the current 
flows through. Alternatively, we can obtain the effective 
current by 
 ( )a Bi C dV dt=  (7) 
where C  is the equivalent capacitance of the OPC. 
Combining (6) and (7), and performing integration, we 
arrive at

Next refer to Figure 6 and suppose a linear controller is 
designed for the system, which takes the velocity error 
measurements, i.e., e1, e2, or both, and outputs control 
voltage u to the motor. The disturbances d1 and d2 are 
assumed to act on the plant output. The case of input 
disturbances can also be considered. 
 
Case I: Single velocity measurement 
Suppose only the velocity measurement from the transfer 
belt is used, i.e.,

where the relationship between P1 and P2 is used. We 
observe from (23) that reducing the effect of the disturbance 
d2 on e2 (by making P2K2 large) actually amplifies the effect 
of d2 on e1. Furthermore, whether e1 will be reduced or not 
depends on the phase information of d1 and d2 at the 
frequency of interest. Similar conclusion can be drawn when 
considering the case with velocity measurement from the 
photosensitive drum only. 
 
Case II: Dual velocity measurements 
Suppose both velocity measurements from the drum and the 
transfer belt are used, i.e.,

Suppose the closed-loop system is well-posed, we thus can 
obtain the transfer function matrix from [d1 d2]T to [e1 e2] T, 
which is

From (26), to make e1 and e2 small at the same frequency 
region, we can make 1 1 1 2 1 3PK PK N N+  large at that 
frequency range, which can be attained by making P1K1, 
P1K2, or both large. However, making either term large will 
amplify e1 or e2 since both appear in the numerator of the 
transfer function matrix. In fact, to minimize e1, we can 
make P1K1 as large as possible while keeping P1K2 minimal. 
This unfortunately will amplify e2. Same conclusion can be 
drawn when trying to minimize e2. Thus it is impossible to

reflectance value depends on many factors, which need 
further investigations that are not the focus of this study. 
The experimental results with the combined motor/laser 
control are presented in Figure 11, which compares the 
reflectance measurement from 10 consecutive prints before 
and after the compensation. Also shown are the test patterns 
used for collecting the reflectance data. We can see 
significant banding reduction on the compensated test 
pattern.

the spatial-based repetitive controller would be robust to 
time-varying but spatially periodic references or disturbances. 
Unfortunately, such reformulation produces a class of 
nonlinear systems in spatial domain, which poses a challenge 
for designing the non-repetitive part of the overall repetitive 
control system. In one of the author’s previous work [8], it 
was proposed that the nonlinear system be linearized around 
the operating velocity, which resulted in a linear 
position-invariant system. A linear position-invariant robust 
repetitive controller was then synthesized for this linear 
system. In another of the author’s previous work [9], it was 
proposed that the nonlinear system be treated as a quasi-linear 
parameter varying (quasi-LPV) system. An LPV self 
gain-scheduling control with anti-windup feature, along with 
a spatial-based repetitive controller, was then designed for 
this system. 
In this paper, we propose another method for design of the 
aforementioned nonlinear system, i.e., the non-repetitive 
portion of the overall repetitive control system. As first step, 
input/output feedback linearization is suggested to eliminate 
the nonlinearity of the system. However, since this approach 
is sensitive to parameter uncertainty, it cannot be applied 
directly without modification. To overcome this disadvantage, 
adaptive feedback linearization as proposed by Sastry [10] is 
used instead to linearize the system while adapting the system 
parameters online to their ‘true’ values. Note that adaptive 
control plays a role here differently from that in previous 
literature (i.e., to adapt the parameters of the system instead of 
the repetitive controller). Finally, a spatial-based 
reduced-order repetitive controller along with a stabilizing 
controller is synthesized and augmented with the adaptively 
feedback linearized system. The overall adaptive repetitive 
control (ARC) system is thus robust to both structured 
uncertainty of system parameters and spatially periodic 
disturbances under variable process speed. Without loss of 
generality and for preliminary study, a second order LTI 
model of a typical rotational motion system is used for 
demonstration and derivation of the control algorithm. 
Simulation is performed to verify the feasibility and 
effectiveness of the proposed scheme. 
This paper is organized as follows. Reformulation of an 
LTI rotational motion system into a nonlinear system in 
angular displacement domain will be presented in Section II. 
Section III will cover derivation and discussion of the 
proposed ARC scheme. Simulation verification for the 
proposed scheme will be presented in section IV. Conclusion 
and future work are given in section V.

Note that Θ  is the ‘true’ parameter vector while Θ  is the 
estimated parameter vector. Since eˆ  and eˆ  are not directly 
measurable, the so-called augmented error scheme may be 
used. Denote 2 1 0( ) 1 ( )M s s sα α= + +    so that (12) implies

where ρ  is an adjustable constant or adaptation rate used to 
improve the convergence property. Stability analysis of the 
proposed adaptation scheme will not be covered here due to 
limitation of the number of pages. 
C. Reduced-Order Repetitive Controller 
Until now the design has not taken into account the output 
disturbance ˆ( )d θ . Note that the nonlinear system will behave 
like a linear system, i.e. (10), after being adaptively feedback 
linearized. Thus, a repetitive controller along with a 
stabilizing controller can be synthesized based on the 
linearized system and the spatial frequencies of the output 
disturbances (which will not vary with the process speed). 
Full-order repetitive controller, i.e., the one with delay taps 
and positive feedback loop, might have the following 
limitations: 
1) For systems with high frequency periodic disturbances, 
high-order repetitive controller is usually required. For 
example, to synthesize a repetitive controller for a system 
subject to periodic disturbance spanning up to 100 Hz, 
first we need to pick a sampling rate higher than 100 Hz. If 
ten-time rule is followed, this will produce a repetitive 
controller of order 1000/5=200.  
2) High-order design is also unavoidable if the system is 
subject to disturbances with different fundamental 
frequencies. For example, for a system subject to 
disturbances with fundamental frequencies of 30 and 35 
Hz, the designer will be forced to use 5 Hz for 
synthesizing the controller. 
3) Due to low-pass nature of the q-filter, the gain of a 
repetitive controller at the periodic frequencies will 
decrease as the frequency increases. This creates issues 
when systems are subject to periodic disturbances 
spanning over a large frequency region. A feasible 
solution is to use multiple repetitive controllers in parallel 
or series, with each aiming at periodic disturbances of 
different fundamental frequency. This, however, will 
increase the controller order and design complexity. 
In this study, we consider a reduced-order and attenuated 
repetitive controller whose continuous-position (as opposed 
to the definition of continuous-time) version can be expressed 
as

where k is the number of periodic frequencies to be rejected,   
niω  is determined based on the ith disturbance frequency in 
rad/rev, and iξ  and iζ  are two damping ratios that satisfy 
 0 1.i iξ ζ< < <  
We can adjust the gain of ˆ ( )R s  at those periodic frequencies 
by varying the values of iξ  and iζ . 
As shown in Figure 1, the output error ˆ ( )E s  and the 
control input ˆˆ ( )RU s  can be related by

where ˆ( )R s  is the repetitive controller and ˆ ( )C s  is a 
stabilizing controller, which can be determined using any 
linear controller design paradigm. The overall closed-loop 
system, after substituting (16) into (10), can be described  by

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The proposed adaptive repetitive control scheme is applied 
to a brush dc motor system. The actual system is assumed to 
be a 2nd order system as described by (1) with 0 5a = , 1 3a = , 
0 6b = , and 1 0b = . For verification purpose, the spatially 
periodic disturbance is assumed to consist of only one 
sinusoidal component: 
 ˆ( ) 0.1 sin(2 ).d θ πθ= ×  
Thus, a feasible ˆ ( )R s  can be expressed as
