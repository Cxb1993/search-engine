Objective
In this project, a quantitative characterization of the ultrasonic image texture and its
correlation with the histopathological finding is developed for facilitating clinical
diagnosis. Various texture features (including statistical feature matrix, co-occurrence
matrix… etc.) are going to be applied to quantify the texture diference of the ultrasonic
images for malignant and benign breast tumors, diffuse liver, thyroid disease and thyroid
nodules.
Methods
Selected patients for liver, thyroid and breast disease are recruited for this study. The
ultrasound imaging systems in clinical use are TOSHIBA SSA-550A, GE LOGIQ 700,
GE LOGIQ 500 and ATL HDI 3000. The parameters used for image acquisition are kept
in the same conditions during clinical examination.
Results
Cirrhotic liver parenchyma tends to have low correlation, high different entropy, low
different variance, high sum average, high variance, high sum variance, lower contrast,
high energy, low entropy, high IDM, high cluster prominence and high dissimilarity than
normal liver parenchyma. The fibrosis in thyroid parenchyma tends to have the lowest
sum average, variance, cluster shade and cluster prominence. Papillary tumors have the
sencondary lowest above values, which may be caused by frequently mixed fibrosis in
papillary tumors. Follicular cells and their elaborate colloids tends to have higher value of
sum average, variance, cluster shade and cluster prominence. The structural texture
changes of the thyroid in different patients of hyperthyroidism do not correlate well with
their function. Textural change in a single plane image may not reflect that of the whole
organ. The cellular and fibrous content with the spatial distribution of the breast masses
determine the dissimilarity values in their ultrasound images.
Conclusions
From the preliminary results, it is shown that the texture features may be used to
quantitatively represent the image and well correlated with the histopathological
description.

2meaning of the echo-texture, the histopathological causes leading to the texture variation,
and why they influence the classification rate are seldom discussed. This may limit the
further application of the texture analysis for ultrasonic image.
研究方法
The analysis model will be applied to the breast, liver and thyroid ultrasound. The
parameters affecting image acquisition were kept in the same conditions. The ultrasound
image inside of our selected rectangle region of interest is going to undergoing textural
analysis. The texture analysis methods available in the study are statistical feature matrix
(SFM) [7][8], co-occurrence matrix (spatial gray-level dependence matrices, SGLDM)
[9]. Representative tissue of the surgically obtained specimen was sampled according to
its corresponding position in the ultrasound image. Through routine hematoxylin-eosin
stain, the histopathological sections were reviewed. The histopathological findings of the
lesions with different values of ultrasound textural feature were compared.

Nodular goiters have the most variable components and heterogeneous
echogenicities. Some components within a nodular goiter are easy to define. Cystic
components present as well-defined, anechoic lesions with posterior acoustic
enhancement. If there is hemorrhagic change of the cystic lesion, low-level internal
echoes would be noted. Calcifications within the nodular goiter present as linear or
curvilinear hyperechoic lesion with posterior acoustic shadowing. The calcifications
of nodular goiter are usually large and coarse. Fibrotic bands within the nodular
goiter are linear hypoechogenicities. Other solid portions within the nodular goiters
are usually composed of follicular cells and colloids. In nodules, which are
composed mostly of follicular cells, are hypoechoic. In nodules, which have
abundant colloids, are hyperechoic (Fig.1 &2).

microcalcifications. It contains tumor cells and fibrous stroma under microscopy.
Several sonographic textural features for classification of colloid (class 1), fibrosis
(class 2), follicular cells (class 3) and papillary cells (class 4) are shown as below boxplot

The average dissimilarity value of hyperthyroidism is 4.38. The average
dissimilarity value of normal subject is 3.75. The standard deviation of hyperthyroidism
is 0.52. The standard deviation of normal subject is 0.35. The p value of two sample t test
(pooled variance) is 0.0008. The texture of thyroid parenchyma is different between the
patients with hyperthyroidism and euthyroidism.
The structural texture changes of the thyroid in different patients of hyperthyroidism
do not correlate well with their function (fig. 7).

 Dissimilarity values in between.
Pathologic findings: dense collagen lesions with small tumorous foci
