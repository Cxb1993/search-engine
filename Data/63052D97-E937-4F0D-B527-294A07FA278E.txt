by maximizing mutual information between its encoder
input and decoder output. This concatenation also im-
proves the overall error performance for i.i.d. Rayleigh
fading channels. While these concatenations may look
very different, there is actually a common ground in be-
tween: the corresponding inner space-time code max-
imizes mutual information in the considered scenarios.
These previous works indicate that mutual information
is a more sensible criterion for the design of inner space-
time codes for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channels. However,
the optimal concatenation between the inner and outer
codes remains unclear for general fading environments.
In this work, we consider the optimal concatenation
of outer LDPC codes with inner space-time codes for
spatially correlated channels. We focus on the set of
LD codes based on our recent work [7] for the inner
space-time codes, which are designed to maximize the
mutual information between the input of the LD code
encoder and the output of the LD code decoder given
channel statistics at the transmitter side. The outer LDPC
codes can then exploit the mutual information provided
by the inner LD codes. The overall error performance
can thus be much improved compared to other concate-
nation methods. Since this set of LD codes also satisfies
the generalized orthogonal condition (GOC), the decod-
ing complexity is similar to that of orthogonal space-time
block codes (OSTBCs) by decoupling the MIMO chan-
nel into the equivalent parallel single-input single-output
(SISO) fading channels. Furthermore, we can readily ap-
ply any existing technique of LDPC codes to the equiv-
alent SISO channels, thereby reducing decoding com-
plexity without much loss of error performance.

Figure 1: Overview of the system.
3.1 System Model
Assume the channel of the system to be frequency flat
and block ergodic with Nt and Nr transmit and receive
antennas, respectively. The considered space-time codes
span Nc channel uses, and then the system can be mod-
eled by the following input-output relationship
Y =
√
Es
Nt
HX+W (1)
where Y ∈ CNr×Nc is the received signal matrix, X ∈
CNt×Nc is the space-time code matrix with the normal-
ized average power constraintE[Tr(XXH)] = NtNc, Es
is the average energy per channel use, H ∈ CNr×Nt re-
mains constant over Nc channel uses, andW ∈ CNr×Nc
is the addictive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) matrix
whose entries are i.i.d. complex Gaussian with zero
mean and unity variance.
3.2 Channel Model
We capture the spatial correlation of the channel by
the following decomposition [8]
H = UrHindUHt (2)
where Ur and Ut denote unitary eigenvector matrices
of the receive covariance matrix E[HHH ] and transmit
covariance matrix E[HHH], respectively. Moreover,
the entries of Hind are statistically independent but not
necessarily identically distributed, and normalized by
E[Tr(HHH)] = NtNr.
2
The outer LDPC codes can exploit the mutual informa-
tion of the effective channel, and the dispersion matrices
of LD codes that satisfy GOC, i.e., (i)AiAHj +AjAHi = 0,
∀i ̸= j, and (ii)AiAHi = Qi, have been proven to achieve
an upper bound on the mutual information in [7]. Thus,
the problem becomes how to chooseQi for the LD codes.
When the statistics of the channel are known to the trans-
mitter, we have the following proposition [7].
Proposition 1 With {A˜i}Ki=1 = {UHt Ai}Ki=1, the optimal
LD codes that maximize the mutual information of the ef-
fective MIMO channel is obtained by choosing A˜iA˜Hi =
Qi = Λsta, ∀i, and
Λsta = argmaxQE
[
ϕ
(
Es
Nt
Tr
(
HindQHHind
))]
subject to Tr(Q) ≤ NtNc
K
(5)
where Λsta is a positive semidefinite diagonal matrix,
ϕ(a) = h(
√
ax + z|H), h(.) denotes the differential en-
tropy, x is a random variable with the same probability
distribution as the transmitted symbols {xk}Kk=1, and z is
a real zero-mean Gaussian random variable with vari-
ance 1/2.
By [7], the mutual information achieved by such codes
is a non-decreasing function ofK. We hence choose the
maximumK, i.e.,K = ⌊2Nc/r⌋ for rank-r Λsta.
The inner LD codes that satisfy GOC and (5) max-
imize the mutual information of the effective channel.
We concatenate such LD codes with an outer LDPC code
described in Section 4.1, referred to as a GOC-LD based
concatenation. On the other hand, the concatenation of
the V-BLAST scheme and the outer LDPC codes in [3]
is referred to as a V-BLAST based concatenation.
4.3 Comparison of Complexity of APP De-
tector
The decoding complexity of the APP detector is pro-
portional to the number of lattice points that must be
searched. Consequently, for the V-BLAST based con-
catenation, decoding of Nt symbols per channel use re-
quires a complexity of O
(
2NtM
(V−BLAST )
c
)
.
The data rate for the V-BLAST based concatenation is
RLDPCNtM (V−BLAST )c , and that for the GOC-LD based
concatenation is RLDPCRLDM (LD)c all in bits per channel
use. Setting these two data rates to the same value for a
fair comparison yields
M (LD)c = NtM
(V−BLAST )
c /RLD. (6)
Due to RLD ≤ 2 and (6) we have to use a larger con-
stellation size for the GOC-LD based concatenation. To
obtain the decoding complexity of the GOC-LD based
concatenation, by substituting (4) into (1), the received
signal in (1) can be expressed as
y =
√
Es
Nt
Ĥx+ w (7)
where y = [(Y)1, ..., (Y)Nr ]
H , x = [x1, ..., xK ]T , w =
[(W)1, ..., (W)Nr ]
H , and
Ĥ =

AH1 (H)H1 AH2 (H)H1 ... AHK(H)H1
AH1 (H)H2 AH2 (H)H2 ... AHK(H)H2
... ... ...
AH1 (H)HNr A
H
2 (H)HNr ... A
H
K(H)HNr
 .
Furthermore, since {Ai}Ki=1 satisfy GOC, {xi}Ki=1 are
real, and AiAHi = UtΛstaUHt , Q, ∀i, which are the
premises of Assumption 1 in [7] and Proposition 1, we
have
ĤH ŷ+ (ĤH ŷ)∗ = 2
√
Es
Nt
Tr(HQHH)x+ n (8)
where n ∼ N (0, 2Tr(HQHH)IK) (real Gaussian), and I
is aK×K identity matrix. Hence, by the linear process-
ing given by (8) at the receiver side, the MIMO channel
can be decoupled into K parallel SISO fading channels
with equivalent average SNR to be 2Es
Nt
Tr(HQHH).
By the linear processing given by (8) at the re-
ceiver side, the MIMO channel can be decoupled into
K parallel SISO fading channels. That is, K sym-
bols are transmitted over Nc channel uses. The de-
coding complexity for the GOC-LD based concatena-
tion per channel use is hence O
(
(K/Nc)2
M
(LD)
c
)
=
O
(
RLD2NtM
(V−BLAST )
c /RLD
)
by (6). So if RLD = 1, the
two concatenations have the same complexity order. If
RLD = 2, the complexity of the GOC-LD based concate-
nation is lower than that of the V-BLAST based concate-
nation whenever NtM (V−BLAST )c > 2. The complexity
reduction increases exponentially with NtM (V−BLAST )c .
Therefore, when the GOC-LD codes are of rank-one
(i.e., Λsta is of rank-one), which are optimal for highly
correlated channels, we can obtain advantages not only
in mutual information but also in decoding complexity.

model [8]. The spatially correlated channels are then de-
scribed by the following channel matrices for each sce-
nario:
1. 2 transmit-antenna, 1 receive-antenna:
• Type 1 Correlation:
V1 = [ 1 0.3 ] (2/1.3) (10)
2. 4 transmit-antenna, 1 receive-antenna:
• Type 1 Correlation:
V1 =
[
1 0.3 0.1 0.7
]
(4/2.1)
(11)
• Type 2 Correlation:
V2 =
[
1.4 0.2 0.1 0.3
]
(4/2) (12)
• Type 3 Correlation:
V3 =
[
0.25 0.25 4 0.1
]
(4/4.6)
(13)
3. 4 transmit-antenna, 2 receive-antenna:
• Type 1 Correlation:
V1 =
[
0.5 0.15 0.05 0.35
0.5 0.15 0.05 0.35
]

(14)
• Type 2 Correlation:

[
0.7 0.1 0.05 0.15
0.7 0.1 0.05 0.15
]

(15)
In order to compare how the channel correlation affects
the channel capacity, the terminology from majorization
theory [11] is used to differentiate degree of correlation
between different channels, which is defined as:
Definition 1 For two vector x,y ∈ Rn, one says that
the vector x majorizes the vector y and writes
x ≻ y if
m∑
k=1
xk ≥
m∑
k=1
yk, m = 1, . . . , n− 1,
and
n∑
k=1
xk =
n∑
k=1
yk.
By denoting the row vector v to be the sum of all the
rows of V. Since we force vi to majorize vj, ∀i > j,
the degree of channel correlation of Vi is greater than
that of Vj, ∀i > j. For the case of two transmit and one
receive antennas with i.i.d. Rayleigh channel, Alamouti
code is known as the optimal space-time code from
a mutual information point of view [5], and so this
code is used as the inner code for our GOC-LD based
concatenation.
For all following simulations, a random edge inter-
leaver, 100 decoder iterations, and an LDPC codeword
length of 4 × 104 bits with RLDPC=1/2 are used. The
error performances for our GOC-LD based concatena-
tion are summarized in Table 1 accompanied with the
corresponding capacity (in terms of the theoretical min-
imum SNR above which bit error rate (BER) drops sig-
nificantly towards zero) of each concatenation. From
the table, we first observe that for Nr = 1, the ca-
pacity of our concatenation is lower than that of the V-
BLAST based concatenation. Their difference increases
as the channel becomes more correlated. This is be-
cause when the channel becomes more correlated, the
GOC-LD codes can exploit more mutual information
by coding across space and time according to channel
statistics while the V-BLAST scheme never takes the
channel correlation into account. For Nr = 2, because
the V-BLAST based concatenation provides multiplex-
ing gain of 2 while GOC-LD based concatenation pro-
vides none, the capacity of the V-BLAST based concate-
nation is lower than that of the GOC-LD based concate-
nation. However when the channel is highly correlated,
the GOC-LD based concatenation can still have lower
capacity than that of the V-BLAST based concatenation
since the dominant eigenvalue of the channel matrix is
much larger than the rest and meanwhile the effective
multiplexing gain of the channel is close to one. This
effect of spatial correlation can be observed clearly in
Fig. 3, where the SNR of our concatenation is indeed
0.4 dB lower than that of the V-BLAST based concatena-
tion when BER=10−4. One can also observe from Table
1 that the SNRs of the GOC-LD based concatenation as-
sociated with BER=10−4 are all within 1.6 dB from their
corresponding capacities, showing the effectiveness of
our EXIT chart analysis.
Moreover, as previously mentioned in Section 4.4,
with the use of any LDPC code designed for BPSK in
AWGN channel and the use of the APP detector only
once for initial L-values for LDPC decoder, we expect
that the performance loss is small. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4
6
Proposition 2 {Ak}Kk=1 satisfy the GOC and AkAHk =
Qk = Qfull for all k where Qfull = UHΛHUHH . The
matrixUH is an eigenvector matrix ofHHH (in the stan-
dard order) and the only non-zero entry in is the leading
diagonal element whose value is
NtNc
K
.
SinceQfull is of rank-one and the mutual information
of the effective channel is an increasing function of K,
we choose the maximum possibleK = 2Nc. Hence, the
capacity of the GOC-LD based concatenation with full
CSI at transmitter can be obtained by substituting Qfull
into (16a)
CfullGOC−LD =

bits/channel use, (17c)
where I(1)Nt = diag{1, 0, . . . , 0}.
6.2 Case I: Nr = 1
When there is only one receive antenna, i.e., Nr = 1
CfullGOC−LD = EH

log2(INr + Es|max{H}|22)
]
(18a)
≥ EH
[
log2(INr + Es
‖H‖22
Nt
)
]
(18b)
= CV BLAST (18c)
We can conclude that under this scenario, the capacity
of effective channel for GOC-LD based concatenation
coincides to be water-filling, and therefore is superior to
any other scheme.
6.3 Case II: Nr > 1
On the other hand, when Nr > 1 and transmitter has
full CSI, GOC-LD based concatenation is not always su-
perior to VBLAST based concatenation as Nr = 1 case.
But by similar method used in [12], we can obtain a suf-
ficient condition that GOC-LD based concatenation out-
performs VBLAST based concatenation in capacity. By
partition the power allocated to GOC-LD based concate-
nation and VBLAST based concatenation to be xEs and
(1 − x)Es, respectively, where x ∈ [0, 1], the capacity
of the effective channel of the combined scheme is:

Since ∂2C

• In the previous discussions, we only consider the
capacity of Gaussian codebook, what will happen
if we apply fixed modulation?
• How this comparison can be applied where there
exists limited feedback. (Some directions, such as
[16–18]?)
• The technique that uses the fact that by applying
the inner space-time code, the EXIT curve would
become almost flat has also been observed in [19].
7 Conclusion
For spatially correlated channels, we have presented
an optimal concatenation of LDPC codes with GOC-LD
codes that outperforms the V-BLAST based concatena-
tion in error performance for one receive antenna. The
improvement increases as the channel becomes more
correlated. Furthermore, our concatenation has a lower
decoding complexity than the V-BLAST based concate-
nation, and the reduction in decoding complexity in-
creases exponentially as a function of NtM (V−BLAST )c
for rank-one GOC-LD codes. Moreover, the informa-
tion exchange between the LDPC decoder and the APP
detector can be eliminated with little loss in error perfor-
mance. However, there are some remaining problems to
be solved as in Sec. 6.5. This is left as a future research.

三、 建議：Such	 kind	 of	 denoting	 conferences	 give	 a	 good	 opportunity	 for	 graduate	 
students	 to	 understand	 more	 of	 the	 research	 dynamics	 in	 the	 related	 areas.	 
Nevertheless,	 the	 chances	 are	 scarce	 due	 to	 the	 limited	 funding	 for	 this	 specific	 
purpose.	 Allocating	 such	 funding	 would	 help	 graduate	 students	 to	 step	 into	 their	 
professional	 academics	 career	 in	 an	 earlier	 stage.
