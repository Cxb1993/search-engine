本計畫所設定的研究目標為：解決寬頻合作式無線多輸出入通訊系統在用戶端高速移
動下，因通道衰落及同步誤差所造成的系統效能損失。高速移動環境所造成的通道衰落及
載波間干擾問題，一直是無線通訊的核心問題，我們從實用角度出發，重新檢視現有方法
的侷限，並提出新的解決方案。合作式系統因 4G 標準開始討論協作式多點傳輸( CoMP )
而有了新的意義，但如何解決多點同步問題也浮上檯面。互相合作形成陣列的天線分散在
極為不同的傳輸環境中，因而無法像傳統處於同一地點的傳送天線陣列達成載波頻率及符
元時間的完全同步。我們經由兩個面向提出同步問題的解決方案。首先我們從設計接收機
著手，我們考慮廣泛使用的阿拉木提多輸出入系統，為其設計一套對同步誤差具有超強容
忍力的接收機，數值模擬結果表明它運用於單載波系統可抵抗極大的載波頻率誤差，運用
於多載波系統則可抵抗極大的符元時間誤差。另外、我們也從編碼設計的角度解決同步問
題。在這裡，我們不將同步誤差視做必須避免的問題，反而視為多集性增益的可能來源。

Abstract 
 
 The goal set in this project is to solve issues caused by fading channels and synchronization 
errors arise from deploying broadband cooperative Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) 
systems with highly mobile users. Performance degradation caused by fading channels and 
inter-carrier interference has always been a core issue for mobile communications. We consider 
these problems from the angle of practical deployment and point out limitations of various 
existing advanced methods. We also provide a good and practical solution. Cooperative MIMO 
obtains new meanings since the 4G standard meetings began discussing Coordinated Multi-Point 
(CoMP) transmission. This also leads to the urgent needs to solve unique challenges of 
synchronization. The synchronization issues have unique characteristics due to the fact that 
cooperating transmitters may be distributed physically and thus may be situated in widely 
different transmission environments, contrasting to co-located transmitters with which the carrier 
frequencies and symbol clocks can be synchronized perfectly. In this project we aim to 
addressing synchronization errors in cooperative MIMO systems from two perspectives. The first 
is to design a receiver which is extremely tolerant with synchronization errors when used in 
combination with common Alamouti schemes. Simulation results show that the receiver can 
retain the diversity order even when large carrier frequency offsets exit in single-carrier systems 
and large symbol timing errors in multi-carrier systems. The second perspective is to solve the 
problem via code design. Instead of viewing synchronization errors as impairments, we treat 
them as potential sources of diversity gain. A Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) scheme 
is eventually developed for cooperative scenarios in which the diversity order can be 
dramatically increased when synchronization errors exist.

1. 前言 
在第四代無線通訊系統中, 3GPP LTE (3rd Generation Partnership Project Long Term 
Evolution，第三代合作夥伴計劃長期演進技術) 以傳輸距離長、傳輸速率高、佈建快、成
本低等特性，已和 WiMAX 成為最被看好的無線寬頻技術。 LTE 的標準主要部分 Release 
8 已於 2009 年完成 [1]。參考各國際大廠日前介紹參與制定行動 LTE-advanced 和 
WiMAX[2]規格的近況，往後發展計畫要能在時速 350 Km/hr 的如此快速移動狀態下的傳
輸速率可達 100 Mb/s，在固定使用無線數據傳輸速率時可達 1Gb/s。  
為了達到如此高的傳輸速率以及保持在高速移動狀態時訊號的可靠度，必須採用
MIMO (多根傳輸天線-多根接收天線) 技術。而合作式(cooperative)或分散式(distributed)的 
MIMO 技術更開始廣受標準組織的青睞。例如， LTE-advanced 開始討論協作式多點傳輸 
Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission 用以改善細胞邊緣的訊號條件及胞內傳輸速
率的提升，其工作原理示意圖如下所示。而 IEEE 802.16e 中規範了一個稱為「協力空間多
工(collaborative spatial multiplexing)」的選項(optional)技術，可以讓兩個用戶台協力進行上
行傳輸，但兩個用戶台需要知道彼此的上傳資料。IEEE 802.16j[3]所規範的是中繼站(relay 
station, RS)技術，規範了中繼站群組(RS grouping)及合作中繼(cooperative relaying)，可以透
過兩個或更多個中繼站來共同向同一用戶台傳送同樣的訊號。IMT-Advanced 可能也都會將
協作式多點傳輸及中繼站視為整個系統的重要組件，自始就納入標準規範。這些標準制定
活動表明廣義上的合作式(cooperative) MIMO 會是熱門的無線通訊技術之一。

抵抗極大的載波頻率誤差，運用於多載波系統則可抵抗極大的符元時間誤差。另外、我們
也從編碼設計的角度解決同步問題。在這裡，我們不將同步誤差視做必須避免的問題，反
而視為多集性增益的可能來源。經由為合作式多輸出入通訊設計一種位元交錯編碼調變
(BICM)方式[24]，我們發現、當同步誤差存在時、多集性增益竟大幅增加，我們也對此結
果做了一些理論分析。至此、在 Alamouti 編碼以及 BICM 的情況下之同步問題，已獲得初
步解決，唯目前開發的接收機演算法仍具高複雜度，降低複雜度也是我們努力的方向。

2. ICI Cancellation in OFDM Systems over Time Varying 
Channels 
First, we address the most common anomaly that faces typical mobile devices, especially 
those devices that employ the current modulation technique of choice – OFDM. In time-varying 
(TV) channels, the channel frequency response (CFR) matrix of OFDM systems is no longer 
diagonal and the off-diagonal terms contribute to ICI. ICI can cause serious performance 
degradation in OFDM systems and many ICI cancellation techniques have been proposed over 
the years to deal with the imperfect CFR matrix; see [5]-[16] and references therein. In [5], [7], 
[8], [12], [15], frequency-domain zero-forcing (ZF) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) ICI 
equalizers are proposed, while time-domain equalizers are investigated in [6]. For these methods, 
the major computational cost comes from matrix inversion. So far the means to reduce the cost is 
imposing the ICI matrix to a banded structure in which all but few elements on selected 
diagonals are set to zero [5]. With the banded structure, matrix inversions of smaller sizes are 
used to calculate coefficients of MMSE or ZF ICI equalizers. A rule of thumbs in [9][12] is to 
choose the bandwidth parameter Q is Q ≥ fD/f + 1, where fD is the maximum Doppler 
frequency and f denotes the subcarrier spacing. However, the BER performance can degrade 
severely when Q is not large enough. 
Other advanced techniques such as nonlinear ICI equalizers offer superb performance, but 
they may have limited implementation readiness due to either higher computational cost or 
limitations specified by standards. Popular wireless broadband access technologies such as 
WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e) and LTE both choose orthogonal frequency division multiple access 
(OFDMA) as the downlink transmission scheme. This will cause problems for decision feedback 
or iterative equalizers, such as those in [7] and [9]; they may not be suitable for OFDMA due to 
the need to know CFR information or data on other users’ or un-occupied subcarriers. Another

where Havg is the diagonal averaged channel matrix part which is not affected by the Doppler 
spread and   is a diagonal channel matrix variation part and G is a fixed ICI channel gain 
matrix which together with  reflect the effect of Doppler spread. 
 The ICI model in provides more insights when it is examined at the subcarrier-level 
granularity. For example, the magnitude of a 32 32 CFR matrix and cross-sections at three 
different subcarriers are shown in Fig. 3. The first thing to notice is that there is no uniform band 
structure in the CFR matrix, since each subcarrier faces very different ICI situations. This 
observation gives us an idea of adapting the ICI-cancellation method according to the ICI 
situation on each sub-carrier. Once this is done, we expect that the computational cost of ICI 
cancellation can be dramatically decreased since most of the sub-carrier, even at very high speed, 
do not really need extensive ICI treatment. As can be seen from the next sub-section, this 
observation is verified by studying the statistical properties of a certain “ICI indicator”.

2.2 ICI Indicator 
 From Fig. 3, we see that the ICI situations at each sub-carrier are quite different. Therefore, 
we would like to devise a measurement which can reflect the different ICI situation at each 
sub-carrier. It is found that the ratio k/Hk (k is the sub-carrier index) can do the job. Given a 
value of |k/Hk|, the corresponding signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be easily calculated. In 
Fig. 3, the 20-th subcarrier, with a small |k/Hk | (|k/Hk | < −5 dB, roughly corresponds to SIR > 
 10 
the percentages of the ICI indicator in four ranges (<= −5 dB, −5 ~ −3 dB, −3 ~ 0 dB, and => 0 
dB) against various vehicle speeds. The table can also be used in evaluating the benefit of 
reducing complexity by adapting ICI cancellers according to the ICI indicator.

2.3 Per-subcarrier Adaptive ICI Cancellation Framework 
 We have learned that the ICI situation is quite different for each sub-carrier. So an intuitive 
way to treat ICI is to adaptively adjust your method from sub-carrier to sub-carrier.  
 
 
Fig. 5. Per-subcarrier adaptive ICI cancellation framework 
 
 Fig. 5 shows our proposed receiver architecture utilizing the ICI indicator. The 
per-subcarrier adaptive ICI equalizer adjusts its setting according to |k/Hk|. The overall 
computational complexity can be greatly reduced with little performance degradation. The 
concept is simple and intuitive, yet has not been seen in the existing literature. In addition, it 
works well with popular wireless access technologies such as WiMAX and LTE based on 
OFDMA. Not only can it be exploited in signal detection but also used for channel estimation, in 
 12 
350 km/h, while the standard requires only 60 km/h. Follow the same simulation set-up in 
Section III with NA = 864 active subcarriers in the 1024- point FFT mode, BER comparisons of 
different ICI equalizers are shown in Fig. 6. The block MMSE ICI equalizer needs to invert a 
864 × 864 matrix, either with the exact CFR matrix or a simplified approximation. The serial 
MMSE ICI equalizer inverts a local small CFR sub-matrix for each subcarrier to achieve lower 
complexity. The matrix size is set by Q which conventionally is fixed for all subcarriers. Our 
per-subcarrier adaptive ICI equalizer adjusts Q according to the ICI indicator. In our simulation, 
Q is chosen from the four settings (Q = 0, 1, 3, and 5) corresponding to the four ranges (≤ −5 dB, 
−5 ~ −3 dB, −3 ~ 0 dB, and ≥ 0 dB) of |k/Hk|. As shown in Fig. 4, our adaptive serial MMSE 
ICI equalizer with Q ≤ 5 achieves, with significantly lower complexity, the same BER as the 
conventional one with fixed Q = 5. Overall, around 86% and 78% of computation can be saved 
when the velocity is kept under 250 and 350 km/h. On the other hand, with a comparable 
complexity, our per-subcarrier approach can afford a larger upper limit on Q, say using Q = 10 
for the last range, and achieve much improved performance. 
 Next we consider how to incorporate with the Maximum APosterior (MAP) equalizer. The 
MAP equalizer offers the optimal performance yet is very costly. In our approach, reduction in 
computational complexity is achieved by reducing the size of trellis at most subcarriers. Note 
that the computational complexity of MAP equalizer grows exponentially which is in proportion 
to the number of states M(2Q+1) at each trellis stage if M-ary modulation is adopted. It is obvious 
that our per-subcarrier approach adjusting Q adaptively will dramatically reduce the complexity, 
especially for the high order modulation. 
 The MAP equalizer, even with a variable-size trellis, is still very costly to implement. In Fig. 
7, a simpler simulation setting with QPSK is used to save simulation time. The result verifies that 
adjusting trellis size does not hurt the performance even when the speed hits 500 km/h. The 
MAP ICI equalizer with variable-size trellis attains the same BER performance as that of the 
MAP ICI equalizer with fixed-size trellis (in fact, their BER curves overlap each other), yet the 
computational cost is significantly reduced. Further reduction of complexity is possible if some 
techniques reported in recent literatures can be incorporated in the future. It is interesting that for 
the case when Q ≤ 3, the MAP ICI equalizer performs better than the block MMSE ICI equalizer. 
It is due to the extra gain provided by combining signals along different ICI paths constructively. 
 
 14 
105, which are 22.2% and 14.2% of the number of flops of the conventional banded serial 
equalizer. In short, for any methods adopting banded approximation, the per-subcarrier adaptive 
framework can help further computational complexity reduction. 
 In summary, an informative indicator of ICI level and a per-subcarrier processing 
framework is proposed; they can work with many existing ICI cancellation methods to reduce 
the computational complexity and maintain the performance simultaneously. Theoretical analysis 
and simulations verify our claims. High flexibility is achieved for trade-off between performance 
and implementation cost. 
 
3. Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets in Cooperative 
Communications 
In this section, we address the first perspective of combating synchronization errors with the 
design of error-tolerant receivers. Notice that we situate our study in the context of utilizing 
space-time coding, especially Alamouti’s space time block code (STBC) in the distributed 
(virtual) MIMO scenarios, due to its effectiveness of obtaining diversity gain as well as its low 
complexity.  
As already mentioned, in distributed MIMO systems, each transmitter may have different 
local oscillators and may not be either frequency or time synchronized, i.e., there exist multiple 
symbol timing offsets (STOs) and multiple carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) [25]-[30]. It is well 
known that OFDM systems are sensitive to frequency offsets, and the performance can degrade 
significantly because of the inter-carrier interference (ICI) due to MCFOs. The resulting 
superposition of all cooperating nodes’ signal causes standard CFO compensation techniques fail 
at the receiver. To deal with this problem, various mitigation techniques have been proposed in 
the literature[25]-[30].  
Conventional equalizers can be used to combat multiple CFOs. A time domain equalizer, 
which aims to maximizing signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) is proposed for space 
frequency coded system [25]. A simple method to convert the matrix inversion to a series of 
small inversions of its diagonal sub-blocks to reduce the calculation complexity is studied in [26]. 
In [27], several detection and complexity reducing techniques are compared. An ICI-self 
cancellation scheme at the price of lowering transmission rate is proposed in [28]. A special two 
branches receiver architecture is proposed in [29]. Based on the iterative inter-carrier interference 
(ICI) cancellation, a two-step cancellation procedure is developed in [30]. Iterative interference 
cancellation is yet another popular technique [31]. However, the performance of these techniques

 Fig. 9. The block diagram of the receiver with the proposed MCFOs mitigation algorithm 
 
From Fig. 9, we can see that there are two signal sets going into the decision block. Due to 
synchronization errors, neither of the two signal sets obtained by the SFBC decoding is 
absolutely better than the other. Signal detection adopts the Minimum Euclidean distance 
decision rule, as is in [29]: the decoded signal with smaller decision error will be deemed as 
more reliable and selected. The detection rule can be expressed as

Alternatively, to show that the two signal sets indeed possess information to further improve 
SINR, we propose an ad hoc method which mimics Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) to 
combine the two signal sets. Express the signals in a short hand notation:

3.4 Simulation Results 
In this section, we show some simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the 
proposed scheme for an uncoded cooperative Alamouti SFBC-OFDM system with two relay 
nodes. The channel used is a four equal gain multipath Rayleigh fading channel (the channel taps 
are uncorrelated complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and normalized variance 
1/2). Other simulation parameters are listed in TABLE II.

Fig. 10 depicts the BER vs. bit signal-noise-ratio (Eb/N0) of the proposed scheme with 
synchronous impairments. To show the tolerance range to large multiple CFOs, the normalized 
multiple CFOs are set to be 
1R = 0.25 and 2R = -0.25. The performance is poor without iterative 
ICI cancellation. With iterative ICI cancellation, the performance improves, and the full diversity 
order is achieved. It is also shown that the MRC-like operation can further improve the SINR 
and the BER approaches the theoretical bound.

Fig. 11 compares the performance of our algorithm and Zhang’s method in [31]. In both 
cases, iterative ICI cancellation is applied. Zhang’s method works fine when multiple CFOs is

In summary, the performance of distributed SFBC-OFDM systems with the presence of 
multiple CFOs is studied. A new SFBC decoding algorithm is proposed for cooperative systems 
to combat multiple CFOs. Iterative interference cancellation is used to further mitigate the ICI 
and reduce the error floor. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective for 
asynchronous cooperative systems. The algorithm has a moderate computational complexity and 
a superior tolerance range of multiple CFOs, compared to existing techniques. Extension to 
single-carrier systems with multiple STOs is also outlined. 
 
3. BICM-OFDM to Combat Multiple Synchronous 
Errors 
In this section, we move on to the second perspective of combating synchronization errors 
in cooperative MIMO communications. We will view the synchronization errors, not as 
impairments which cause performance degradation, rather as potential sources of diversity gains. 
Through careful design of a BICM-based scheme and an iterative receiver, it will be shown that 
dramatic increase of diversity gain is actually achieved when severe synchronization errors exist. 
 
3.1 System Model 
We adopt the decode-and-forward protocol for this section, and BICM-OFDM [24] are 
chosen as the transmission technique. Fig. 13 shows a generic block diagram of a system 
employing BICM-OFDM, at the source side the information bits denoted b are first encoded by 
the outer convolutional encoder and the encoded bits are denoted by c∈C, C being the codeword 
set. The interleaver ∏ operates on K OFDM symbols of encoded bits with the output denoted by 
c’, then the inner differential precoder with recursive structure [34] is deployed to enhance 
overall performance and its output is denoted by d. The resulting bits are mapped into QAM or 
PSK symbols. The set of constellation points is denoted by χ, as γ bits are mapped into one of 2γ 
constellation points according to the mapping rule. After loading the modulated symbols onto 
active subcarriers, OFDM signal x is generated via N-point IFFT and CP is inserted. The 
performance depends on the size of interleaver that is γKN bits. Note that the encoded bits are 
interleaved across several OFDM systems and it is called time-frequency interleaving. The 
time-domain transmitted signal at Relay Node α can be written as

3.2 The Receiver Algorithm 
For the receiver, both MSE and MLSE equalizers can be used. Here we focus on the design 
of MLSE receiver in the frequency domain and the overall receiver. The iterative receiver 
consists of a Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) MLSE demapper/equalizer and Maximum A 
Posterior (MAP) decoders for both the precoder and the convolutional encoder. The soft outputs 
are typically represented by the log-likelihood ratio (LLRs). The signal detection in the 
demapper/equalizer is carried out with MLSE.  
The task of the equalizer is to estimate the transmitted X based on the received observations 
R. more specifically, the maximum likelihood sequence estimation is to choose that sequence of 
symbols X={x1,x2,…,xK} that maximizes the likelihood of the received sequence of observation 
R={R1,R2,…,RK}, i.e., maximizes the joint conditional probability the P(R|X). the obtained

3.3 Simulation Results and Discussion 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLSE receiver, Monte Carlo simulations are carried 
out, and we compare the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance between the MLSE equalizer and 
MMSE equalizer. Notice that both receivers effectively harvest the extra diversity gain provided 
by synchronization errors. 
We consider a BICM-OFDM system with N = 64, CP length = 8, and 4-QAM modulation. A 
two-path wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) Rayleigh fading channel 
(generated using Jakes Model) between any relay nodes and each relay are equal power, the 
convotional code uses G(D)=(1+D
2
,1+D+D
2
) as the generator polynomial, and G(D)=1/(1+D
2
) is 
the generator polynomial for the precoder. One frame consists of 10 OFDM symbols. 
Furthermore, perfect estimations of MCFOs and channel matrices are assumed.  
Fig. 14 shows the BER performance versus SNR for the comparison between conventional 
MMSE equalizer, traditional 1-tap equalizer and the MLSE equalizer in synchronous 
impairments. For the simulation, normalized Doppler frequency fd=0.001 is employed at both 
relays, the normalized MCFOs are 0.2 and -0.2. With the large MCFOs, the 1-tap equalizer 
suffers an obvious error floor.

Fig. 14. BER comparison between MMSE equalizer, 1-tap equalizer and MLSE equalizer in 
the cooperative communication 
 
On contrast, the MLSE equalizer not only successfully compensates for the ICI but also 
obtain an SNR gain about 3dB. The benefits of SNR gain, we can via SINR to explicit 
explanation and the derivation in appendix. The optimal solution is joint processing of 
demodulation and decoding is considered, which lead to approach low bound. Notice that with 
both equalizers the system achieves full diversity.  
Fig. 15 shows the results for the two relay nodes and three relay nodes. It can be seen from 
the figure that as the number of relay increases in the systems, the diversity order of distributed 
BICM-OFDM increases up to the maximum diversity of  min{M×rT×L,dfree}. It can be 
observed that the tree relays case has a diversity order of 5 and the BER curve is steep.  
 28 
MLSE-based frequency domain equalizer combined with a turbo decoder to break the error floor. 
The proposed approach has excellent BER performance, and it is flexible in a way that extension 
to more relays for improvement in diversity gain is straightforward. The complexity is a big 
problem in the receiver if D is greater than three, and future research in the complexity reduction 
will be considered. 
 
4. 結果與討論 
寬頻合作式無線多輸出入通訊系統如果運行在一高速移動環境中，因都普勒效應及多
重同步誤差所造成的通道衰落及載波間干擾問題，將造成嚴重的系統效能損失，大大地降
低了這類方法的實用性。在高速移動問題方面，我們探討了載波間干擾問題，瞭解到具成
本效益與良好表現的方法仍為業界急需，我們從實用角度出發，重新檢視現有方法的侷限，
並提出新的解決方案，同時我們的通道模型也非常適合寬頻合作式無線多輸出入通訊系統
的通道估測需求。 
在同步問題方面，合作式通訊系統和一般習見的情況有所不同、同步問題在傳送端便
已存在。互相合作形成天線陣列也許分散在極為不同的傳輸環境中，因而無法像傳統處於
同一地點的傳送天線陣列達成載波頻率及符元時間的完全同步。本計畫預計經由兩個面向
提出同步問題的解決方案。首先我們從設計接收機著手，我們考慮廣泛使用的阿拉木提多
輸出入系統，為其設計一套對同步誤差具有超強容忍力的接收機，數值模擬結果表明它運
用於單載波系統可抵抗極大的載波頻率誤差，運用於多載波系統則可抵抗極大的符元時間
誤差。 
其次、我們也從編碼設計的角度解決同步問題。在這裡，我們不將同步誤差視做必須
避免的問題，反而視為多集性增益的可能來源。經由為合作式多輸出入通訊設計一種位元
交錯編碼調變方式，我們發現、當同步誤差存在時、多集性增益竟大幅增加，我們也對此
結果做了一些理論分析。至此、在 Alamouti 編碼以及 BICM 的情況下之同步問題，已獲得
解決。 
 
5. 計劃成果自評 
總結我們的技術成果，在於解決合作式通訊(分散式多輸出入系統 distributed MIMO)在
搭配 Alamouti 編碼或是 BICM 的情況下之同步問題，以及高速移動下可能面臨的載波間干
擾問題。我們提出一個可評估載波間干擾嚴重性並隨時調整的處理架構，有效降低了運算
成本，確實為業界所需之實用性技術。我們也發展了兩套傳輸架構，兩者皆有極佳的同步

國科會補助專題研究計畫項下出席國際學術會議心得報告 
                                   日期： 100 年 8 月 26 日 
                                 
一、參加會議經過 
     IEEE PIMRC 在無線通訊領域雖不是頂尖、也算是較知名的會議。本次參加會議、
除了 keynote speech 和一般技術論文發表的場次，也著重參與各類 panel 
discussion ，並積極與業界工程師們交流，希望進一步瞭解實務上大家對無線通訊發
展方向的看法。 
   我的論文安排在 29 號早上之 MIMO III session ，很遺憾場地聲學狀況不理想，講
者和聽眾之間交流並不順利，也警惕我是否演講題目並未引起廣泛興趣？我在發表後
也同幾位聽眾交流，發現本場次聽眾背景較雜、應與論文題目不統一有關。 
    幾場 Panel discussion 皆緊扣當前發展熱點，聽眾參與熱情高漲，討論很盛，我也
問了兩個問題，獲益頗豐，於下節與會心得中詳述。
