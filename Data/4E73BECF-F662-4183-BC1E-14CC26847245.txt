Abstract 
In the first year of this project, the study 
mainly investigates the pipe flow with 
transverse inline fins which has different 
h e i g h t - w i d t h  r a t i o s  b u t  o f  s a m e 
cross-sectional area. Numerical technique of 
finite difference method is employed to 
solve the mixed convection problem. A 
two-dimensional steady laminar flow is 
assumed in the round tubes with rectangular 
in internal finned tubes analytically. 
Assuming isothernal fins, Masllyah and 
Nandakumar [3] investigated the heat 
transfer characteristics for a laminar fully 
developed flow with fins of triangular shape 
by finite element method. Then, Soliman et 
al. [4] presented an analysis for fully 
developed laminar convective heat transfer 
in tubes with internal longitudinal fins. It 
was shown that both the fins and fluids 
temperature are strongly dependent on 
finned tube geometry and fin conductance as 
well. For simultaneously developing flow 
and heat transfer, Rustum and Soliman [5, 6] 
presented local and average friction factor 
and Nusselt numbers for a wide range of gin 
geometries. In addition,  Mirza and 
Soliman [7] and Rustum and Soliman [8] 
numerically analyzed the effect of internal 
finning on mixed convection subject to 
uniform heat flux boundary conditions. 
Numerical solutions of the developing 
temperature field were obtained by Kettner 
et al. [9] for fully developed laminar flow in 
an finned tube of finite thermal conductivity. 
It is found that the assumption of infinite 
thermal conductivity of the fin is not 
justified and may lead to significant 
overestimated heat transfer. 
Later, Shome and Jenson [10, 11] extended 
the numerical analyses to include helical fins 
as well as variable viscosity and mixed 
convection effects for developing laminar 
flow in finned tubes. Furthermore, Shome 
[12] found that the effect of internal finning 
on buoyancy-induced secondary flow is 
complex and leads to the production of 
two-cell counterrotating vortex structure. 
Huq and Aziz-ul Huq [13] proposed a 
simple approximate way for the prediction 
of the two asymptotes for the local Nusselt 
number in laminar forced convection flows 
inside internal longitudinal finned tubes. 
Numerical simulation of steady, laminar 
heat transfer in circular tubes fitted with four 
identical longitudinal fins having tapered 
lateral profiles was presented by Alam and 
Ghoshdastidar [14]. Al-Sarkhi and 
Abu-Nada [15] performed a numerical 
investigation of a vertical internally finned 
tube subjected to forced convection heat 
transfer. Ho and Chen [16] investigates the 
effects on collector efficiency of a 
double-pass sheet-and-tube solar water 
heater with fins attached under various 
arrayed density. Very recently, Andrew et al. 
[17] conducted A numerical study to 
investigate the fluid flow and heat transfer 
characteristics of a square microchannel 
with four longitudinal internal fins. 
In experiment, Carnavos [18, 19] presented 
experimental data and empirical correlations 
for the friction factor and Nusselt number in 
internally f.i.nned tubes and found that heat 
transfer was increased by 25 ~ 180% with a 
50 ~ 500% increase of friction factor. 
Furthermore, Shome and Jenson [20] 
measured the heat transfer and pressure drop 
for thermal developing flow in an internally 
finned tubes. To make the results more 
applicable, Jenson and Vlakancic [21] 
investigated the parametric effects of fin 
geometry on turbulent friction factors and 
Nusselt numbers in internally finned tubes. 
The purpose of this work is to study the 
heat transfer characteristics of the heat 
 4
the momentum equation was first solved at 
all mesh points along a radial line. After all 
radial lines have been swept successively in 
the angular direction, one iteration is 
completed and the newly calculated 
velocities were compared with their 
corresponding values from the previous 
iteration. Convergence is assumed when the 
following criterion is met. 
Max|ui,jm+1- ui,jm|/|ui,jm+1| < 10-4        (13) 
where m is the mth iteration. Then, using 
Eqs. (2) and (4), the friction factor and 
Reynolds number can be calculated. 
In solving the temperature, the matching 
conditions imposed at the fluid-solid 
interface, are cast in backward difference for 
solid and forward difference for fluid. Since 
there were two energy equations, Eqs. (5) 
and (6), and two sets of boundary conditions, 
the solution methods are more involved and 
complicated. 
IV. Experiment 
4.1 Experimental devices 
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) shows the 
photograph and schematic diagram of 
experimental system. There are four 
thermocouples, T1, T2, T3 and T4 
arranged at the inlet and outlet of the inner 
as well as outer tubes, respectively. A 
pressure gage, P1, is installed in the 
entrance of the inner tube and a differential 
pressure gage DP1 is set on the exit of the 
inner tube. Similarly, a pressure gage, P2, 
is installed in the inlet of the outer tube and 
a differential pressure gage DP2 is made 
on the outlet of the outer tube. Two 
flowmeters are equipped on the pipe 
leaving the refrigerated water and hot 
water circulators. In addition, a signal 
converter module (B) and an SDBS 
distributor (C) are used to help the 
acquisition of experimental data with a 
portable computer. Note that the hot water 
circulator with a well-stirred design is 
installed to keep the hot water around 70 
℃.Likewise, the refrigerated water 
circulator is designed to keep the cold 
water temperature at about 15 ℃. 
A double pipe heat exchanger is tested 
with the longitudinal fins installed on the 
inside of the inner tube. The inner as well 
as outer tube and fins are made of 
aluminum alloy 6063. There are three 
kinds of test units: one is smooth inner 
tube, the other is inner tube with four 
longitudinal fins and another is inner tube 
with eight longitudinal fins. Detailed of the 
cross-sectional views of the test units can 
be observed in Fig. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c). 
4.2 Experimental procedure 
Air is purged on starter-up of the 
experimental device. This is checked with 
the cock installed on the pipe. It is ensured 
that no air is escaped from the cock before 
the test. After having set the temperatures of 
the hot and cold water, the working fluids 
are made to circulate until steady state is 
reached. This will usually take about thirty 
minutes. The inner tube either with fins or 
not are all polished mirror clean before the 
experiment. The hot water runs through the 
inner tube whereas the cold water is made to 
pass the outer tube. In order to simulate the 
constant-temperature boundary condition, 
the mass flowrate for cold water is set about 
ten times of that for hot water.

V. Results and discussion 
5.1 numerical results 
Initially, four types of fins are selected for 
analysis in this study. They all have the same 
cross-sectional area of fins, but have 
different fin length and extended angles, as 
shown in Table 1.

of fins. From the observations of Figures 3 
to 6, the isotherms of the four type heat 
exchanger are demonstrated. The red color 
stands for the high temperature region 
whereas the blue color represents low 
temperature regime. In addition, from the 
colorful diagram, the temperature gradients 
of the four exchangers can be seen clearly. 
After comparison, it shows that the 
temperature drop in type-4 exchanger is the 
largest. Also, it is proved that the most 
slender fin performs the best in heat transfer. 
 
5.2 Experimental results 
Figure 7 plots the dependence of Nu on Re 
for smooth inner tube operated at the angles 
of 0°, 30°,60°, and 90°. It is shown that the 
operating angles did not play an important 
role in the determination of Nu. The effects 
of inclination on Nu for different Reynolds 
number for four-fin and eight-fin exchangers 
are given in Figure 8 and Figure 9, respect- 
ively. Similar results are obtained. It is noted 
that Nu for heat exchanger operated under 
90° is the smallest among all.
