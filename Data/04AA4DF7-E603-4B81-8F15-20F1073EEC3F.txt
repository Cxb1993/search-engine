equations are derived, and feedback control laws for 
the linearized system for a ellipsoid shaped testbed 
glider were developed in [4]. The stability of this 
nonlinear system using linearization control was 
shown by numerical simulations. Equilibrium points 
of the nonlinear glider model were also derived in [4]. 
An estimation of energy cost for the buoyancy 
engines operating at different water depths was shown 
in [5]. In [6], design considerations of gliders and 
wings were described. Maximum velocities of gliders 
with various body sizes and buoyancy engine 
capacities were studied in [6]. 
In this work, we discuss design issues regarding 
applying buoyancy engines as the device to vary net 
buoyancy force and to alternate the position of the 
center of gravity. This kind of buoyancy engines 
arrangement contains two tanks located at the fore 
and end aft part of the hull. Buoyancy engines 
considered here are those of piston-type. The glider 
does not use longitudinal mass-shifting device. To 
glide with symmetrical gliding path in ascending and 
descending, positions of both water tanks are assumed 
to be symmetrical to the center of buoyancy (C.B.). In 
other words, the lengths between C.B. and water 
tanks are identical. To gain the best moment from the 
change of the water mass, fore and aft buoyancy 
engines are configured at the head and end parts of 
the hull. High external water pressure causes large 
energy consumption when expelling water out of tank. 
To avoid wasting energy, some operational constrains 
of glider have to be confirmed. In II, forces 
equilibrium in gliding is established. And the 
performance of gliders with fore and aft buoyancy 
engines are calculated. In III, energy cost of the 
buoyancy changes are estimated with a simplified 
model. Glide angle that corresponds to the least 
amount of energy in operating the buoyancy engines 
are specified. Design considerations with fixed wings 
to minimize energy cost and to enlarge the working 
envelop using the fore and aft buoyancy engines 
configuration is proposed. In IV, energy cost of 
buoyancy engines for horizontal distance is discussed. 
Energy cost in expelling water and holding pistons 
position are both considered. The results of 
experiments are also described. Section V gives 
conclusions.

I I .   MODELING  
 
   Graver [12] models the underwater glider as a 
rigid body with fixed wings and tail immersed in a 
fluid with buoyancy control and controlled internal 
moving mass. They assigned a coordinate frame fixed 
on the vehicle body to have its origin at the center of 
buoyancy (CB) and its axes aligned with the principle 
axes of the ellipsoid. Body axes are illustrated in 
Fig.1. In Fig. 2, the position vector ( , , )Tb x y z=  
is the vector from the origin of the inertial frame 
i j k− − , to the origin of body frame 1 2 3e e e− − . 
The vehicle moves through the fluid with translational 
velocity 1 2 3( , , )Tv v v v=  and angular velocity 
1 2 3( , , )TΩ = Ω Ω Ω , expressed with respect to the 
body frame. 
The different masses and position vectors are 
illustrated in Fig.3. 1 2 3( , , )TP P P Pr r r r=  denotes 
the position vector of movable mass. Here the hm  is 
the uniformly distributed hull mass, wm  is point 
mass for nonuniform hull mass distribution, and wr  
is the position vector from CB to wm . bm  is the 
variable mass located at CB. m  is the movable 
point mass. The total mass of the glider is then 
v h w bm m m m m= + + + . 
 
Following the discussions in Graver [12], the 
equations of motion for the gliding vehicle in the

III. GLINDING ENERGY 
 
In this section, energy cost of buoyancy engines and 
the operational constrains for gliders with fore and aft 
buoyancy engines are discussed. The work done on 
the glider by buoyancy engines are the energy source 
for gliding. The buoyancy engine was composed by a 
servo motor, a gear train, and a piston. The face of 
the piston was covered by a plastic membrane to 
isolate the piston with sea water. No friction between 
the piston and the cylinder is considered due to the 
fact that the piston is made to be floating inside the 
cylinder.  
In Fig. 7, sA  is the area of piston and s∆  is the 
displacement of piston. Firstly, assuming that 
accelerations of the piston are ignored since the 
piston expels and attracts water with small speeds. In 
other words, the force supported by motor 
m
f  is 
always equal to the force generated by water 
pressure Pre .

water tank of 8-meter depth with grids on the wall for

    Figure 11 shows ehΓ  in different velocities and 
glide angles and dep=50m. Comparing eΓ  and 
ehΓ , in Fig. 11, eΓ  is small while velocity is small. 
eΓ  in V=0.2 m/s is lager than eΓ  in V=0.6 m/s and 
V=0.4 m/s due to the energy cost of motors in holding 
pistons position. And the optimal eΓ  in V=0.6 m/s 
is also lager than eΓ  in V=0.4 m/s. So the optimal 
glide angles and velocities could be found at different 
gliding depth. At dep=50m, optimal glide angle is 
18.2° and velocity is 0.4 m/s. The values of optimal 
glide angle and velocity are determined by the hull 
shape of glider and the ratio of power for expelling 
water and holding pistons position.

In case 2, desired depths to send ascending and 
descending command were 2.5 and 0.5 meters. 
Desired dive number was 2 times. The initial ballast 
masses are 
ab
m =0.3653 kg and 
bb
m =0.3185 kg. 
Figure 14 shows gliding depth was just deeper than 
2.5 meters at 54 second and 222 second. At the mean 
time, the commands to ascend were send as shown in 
Fig. 5.13 and the desired ballast masses in ascending 
were 
ab
m =0.2328 kg and 
bb
m =0.2795 kg. At 118 
second, depth was just shallower than 0.5 meters and 
command to descend was sent. Same as in the case 1, 
response of pitch angle shown in Fig.15 displayed 
that gliding is in transient and the obvious variation is 
due to that the anterior part floats out water while the 
posterior part was still immersed in water.    The 
command was switched while depth is deeper than 
2.5 m and shallower than 0.5 m for 2 times.

V.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
Design issues of a glider equipped with fore and 
aft buoyancy engines are considered. Force equations 
are used to determine ballast masses of buoyancy 
engines in order to achieve desired glide angle and 
the forward velocity. The tank capacity of the 
buoyancy engine is determined by specifying the 
glide angle envelope. Energy cost of the buoyancy 
changes are estimated with a piston model. Glide 
angle that corresponds to the least amount of energy 
in operating the buoyancy engines are specified. 
Design with fixed rectangular wings for minimizing 
energy cost and enlarging the working envelop using 
the fore and aft buoyancy engines configuration is 
discussed. Model of glider with fore and aft buoyancy 
engines has been established.  Motion simulation of 
glider shows characteristics of gliding responds under 
buoyancy control. Pitch control method considering 
rate of expelling and attracting water are simulated. 
Experiments results show glider with fore and aft 
buoyancy engines could work as well as conventional 
glider with one buoyancy engine and weight shifting 
device. Considering energy cost per horizontal 
distance, the optimal glide angle for the testbed glider 
developed in this work while V>0.3 m/s is 22.4°.
