Advances in technology, especially the advent of VLSI circuit technology, have made it possible to 
build a large-scale parallel and distributed system involving thousands or even tens of thousands of 
processors. For example, the Connection Machine [24] contains as many as 216 processors. One crucial 
step on designing such a system is to determine the topology of the interconnection network (network 
for short). A network is conveniently represented by a graph (or digraph). The vertices represent the 
nodes of the network, i.e., processors or memory modules or switches, and the edges represent the 
communication links. Throughout this proposal, we use network and graph, node and vertex, and edge 
and link, interchangeably. 
Let G=(V, E) be a connected graph, where V and E represent the vertex set and edge set of G, 
respectively. The degree of a vertex in G is the number of edges incident with it. If all vertices have 
the same degree d, then G is called regular or d-regular. The diameter of G is the maximal distance 
between any two vertices. The vertex (edge) connectivity of G is the maximal number of vertices 
(edges) in G whose removal can cause G disconnected or trivial. Usually, connectivity is used to 
denote vertex connectivity. 
In recent decades, a large number of networks have been proposed in the literature, e.g., 
hypercubes [40], k-ary n-cubes [12], star graphs [1], generalized hypercubes [6], pancake graphs [2], 
cube-connected cycles [37], rotator graphs [10], butterfly graphs [34], wrapped butterfly graphs [4], 
crossed cubes [15], bridged hypercubes [16], folded hypercubes [17], twisted cubes [18], M√∂bius 
cubes [11], Fibonacci cubes [30], hyper Petersen networks [13], folded Petersen cube networks [35], 
alternating group graphs [32], hypercomplete networks [8], arrangement graphs [14], recursive 
circulant graphs [36], and hierarchical cubic networks [22]. 
An embedding of one (guest) graph G into another (host) graph H is a one-to-one mapping f from 
the vertex set of G to the vertex set of H [34]. Hence an edge of G can correspond to a path of H under 
f. There are four measures, i.e., dilation, congestion, load, and expansion, which are commonly used to 
evaluate an embedding. The dilation of f is the maximal length of the paths in H that are the images of 
edges in G under f. The congestion of f is the maximal number of edges in G whose images under f 
contain the same edge in H. The load of f is the maximal number of vertices in G that have the same 
image in H. The expansion of f is the ratio of the number of vertices in H to the number of vertices in 
G. If the first three measures are all constant, any algorithm executable on G can be executed on H as 
well with constant overhead. 
Linear arrays and rings, which are two of the most fundamental networks for parallel and 
distributed computation, are suitable for developing simple algorithms with low communication costs. 
Many efficient algorithms that were designed on linear arrays and rings for solving a variety of 
3 
[5] that that for any k-ary n-cube with ‚â§ 4n ‚àí 5 link faults in which each node is incident to at least two 
nonfaulty links, a fault-free hamiltonian cycle can be obtained, where k ‚â• 3 and n ‚â• 2. 
In this project, we investigated the hamiltonicity of some networks with edge faults over the 
connectivity of the networks. These networks are hypercubes, twisted cubes, crossed cubes, star 
graphs, complete graphs, and alternating group graphs. 
An n-dimensional binary hypercube (n-cube for short) is an undirected graph with 2n nodes each 
labeled with a distinct binary string b1b2‚Ä¶bn. Node b1‚Ä¶bi‚Ä¶bn and node b1‚Ä¶ ib ‚Ä¶bn are joined by an 
edge along dimension i, where 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n and ib  is the one's complement of bi. We will try to show 
that for any n-cube (n ‚â• 3) with ‚â§ 2n ‚àí 5 link faults in which each node is incident to at least two 
non-faulty links, there exists a fault-free path with a length of 2n ‚àí 1 (or 2n ‚àí 2) between two arbitrary 
nodes of odd (or even) distance. 
The node set of the twisted n-cube TQn, is the set of all binary string of length n, where n is odd. 
Let b = bn‚àí1bn‚àí2‚Ä¶b0 denote one node in TQn. For i ‚àà {0, 1, ‚Ä¶, n ‚àí 1}, let the i-th parity function Pi(b) 
= bi‚äïbi‚àí1‚äï‚Ä¶‚äïb0, where ‚äï denote the exclusive-or operation. The TQn can be defined recursively as 
follows: TQ1 is a complete graph with two nodes 0 and 1. Suppose that n ‚â• 3. We can decompose the 
nodes of TQn into four sets, 002‚àínTQ , 
01
2‚àínTQ , 
10
2‚àínTQ , and 
11
2‚àínTQ  where 
ij
nTQ 2‚àí  consists of those nodes 
b with bn‚àí1 = i and bn‚àí2 = j. For each ij ‚àà {00, 01, 10, 11}, the induced subgraph of ijnTQ 2‚àí  in TQn is 
isomorphic to TQn‚àí2. Edges which connect these four subtwisted cubes can be described as follows: A 
node b = bn‚àí1bn‚àí2‚Ä¶b0 is connected to 021 ...bbb nn ‚àí‚àí  and 021 ...bbb nn ‚àí‚àí  if Pn‚àí3(b) = 0; if Pn‚àí3(b) = 1 then 
b is connected to 021 ...bbb nn ‚àí‚àí  and 021 ...bbb nn ‚àí‚àí . We will try to show that for any TQn with ‚â§ 2n ‚àí 5 
link faults in which each node is incident to at least two nonfaulty links, a fault-free hamiltonian cycle 
can be obtained, where n ‚â• 3 and n is odd. 
The node set of the crossed n-cube CQn, is the set of all binary string of length n. Let b = 
bn‚àí1bn‚àí2‚Ä¶b0 denote one node in CQn. First, define two two-digit binary strings x and y are pair related, 
which is denoted by x ~ y, if and only if (x, y) ‚àà {(00, 00), (10, 10), (01, 11), (11, 01)}. The CQn can 
be defined recursively as follows: CQ1 is a complete graph with two nodes 0 and 1. CQn consists of 
two identical (n ‚àí 1)-dimension crossed cubes 0 1‚àínCQ  and 1 1‚àínCQ . Edges which connect these two 
subcrossed cubes can be described as follows: A node 0bn‚àí2bn‚àí3‚Ä¶b0, which is in 0 1‚àínCQ , is connected 
to node 1un‚àí2un‚àí3‚Ä¶u0 if and only if (1) bn‚àí2 = un‚àí2 if n is even, and (2) for 0 ‚â§ i < ‚é•‚é¶

This probability is very much closed to 1. Therefore, our purpose is to prove that the probability that 
the network that remains after removing ‚â§ 2n ‚àí 5 faulty links from an n-cube is still strongly 
Hamiltonian laceable is almost 1. 
Conveniently, a binary n-cube can be represented with 
n
**...* =*
n where *‚àà{0, 1}. Hence, *n‚àí11 
and *
n‚àí10, which contain the nodes of a n-cube whose rightmost bits are 1 and 0, respectively, 
represent two disjoint (n‚àí1)-cubes that are contained in the n-cube. Suppose that X = x1x2‚Ä¶xn and Y = 
y1y2‚Ä¶yn are two nodes in an n-cube. We use X (i) to denote the binary string x1‚Ä¶ ix ‚Ä¶xn and use dH(X, 
Y) to denote the Hamming distance between X and Y, i.e., the number of different bits between X and Y. 
A path from X to Y is abbreviated to an X-Y path. On the other hand, we say that a node is healthy if it 
is not faulty. 
The basic embedding idea uses an inductive proof. Clearly, an (n + 1)-cube can be partitioned into 
two node-disjoint n-cubes. It is assumed that a longest fault-free path between two arbitrary nodes can 
be embedded in an n -cube with ‚â§ 2n ‚àí 5 faulty links, where each node is incident with at least two 
healthy links. We want to embed the longest path between two arbitrary nodes in an (n + 1)-cube with 
‚â§ 2(n + 1) ‚àí 5 = 2n ‚àí 3 faulty links, in which each node is incident to at least two healthy links. First, 
the (n + 1)-cube will be partitioned into two disjoint n-cubes such that every node is incident with at 
least two healthy links in each subcube. Then, we can combine the longest paths in these two n-cubes 
into a longest path in the (n + 1)-cube. We have proven following lemma, which shows that such a 
partition method exists. 
Lemma 1. Suppose there are at most 2n ‚àí 3 link faults in *n+1 and each node is incident to at least two 
healthy links. There exists an integer j ‚àà{1, 2, ‚Ä¶, n + 1} such that each node in *j‚àí10*n+1‚àíj (or 
*
j‚àí11*
n+1‚àíj) is incident to at least two healthy links in *
j‚àí10*
n+1‚àíj (or *
j‚àí11*
n+1‚àíj), and at least one link 
along dimension j is faulty. 
On the other hand, we have following new results: 
Lemma 2. The network that remains after removing any two adjacent nodes from an n-cube is 
Hamiltonian.

n
ini q  for all q ‚àà {1, 2, ‚Ä¶, n}, where *i denotes i consecutive *s. 
Every embedded Sn‚àí1s are connected with the links along dimension i. If we regard each embedded 
Sn‚àí1 as a supernode, then all embedded Sn‚àí1s forms a complete graph. There are (n ‚àí 2)! links along 
dimension i between two arbitrary supernodes. When we consider Sn in this way, with n disjoint 
embedded Sn‚àí1s, which is joined by link along dimension i, we say that we have partitioned Sn over 
dimension i. For example, we can partition S4 over dimension 3 and then produce four embedded S3s, 
i.e., 
3
*1** , 
3
*2** , 
3
*3** , and 
3
*4** . Suppose Sn are partitioned over dimension n. 
Additionally, we have following lemma, which is very useful for our purpose. 
Lemma 4. Suppose there are at most 2n ‚àí 5 link faults in Sn+1 and each node is incident to at least two 
healthy links. We can partition Sn+1 over some dimension i ‚àà{1, 2, ‚Ä¶, n + 1} such that for all q ‚àà{1, 
2, ‚Ä¶, n + 1}, each node is incident to at least two healthy links in 
n
ini q ‚àí+‚àí 11 ** , and at least one link 
along dimension i is faulty. 
On the basis of Lemmas 4, we can investigate the hamiltonicity of Sn with 2n ‚àí 7 link faults in 
which each node is incident to at least two non-faulty links.  
The property of alternating group graphs is closed to that of the star graph. According to the 
experience of the study on the star graph, it is possible to explore the hamiltonicity of alternating 
group graphs with edge faults over their connectivity.

In the first year, we have explored the hamiltonicity of hypercubes, crossed cubes, and twisted 
cubes with edge faults over their connectivity.  
First, We have shown that for any n-cube (n ‚â• 3) with ‚â§ 2n ‚àí 5 link faults in which each node is 
incident to at least two healthy links, a fault-free Hamiltonian path can be obtained between two 
arbitrary nodes in different partite sets, and a fault-free path with length 2n ‚àí 2 can be obtained 
between two arbitrary nodes of the same partite set. 
Secondly, with the assumption of at least two fault-free links incident with each node, we have 
shown that there exists a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle in an n-dimensional crossed cube (CQn) with up 
to 2n‚Äì5 link faults. 
Last, with the assumption of at least two fault-free links incident with each node, we have shown 
that there exists a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle in an n-dimensional crossed cube (TQn) with up to 2n‚Äì5 
link faults.

crossed cube is n (see [20]). It was shown in [3] that both the n-wide diameter and the (n  1)-fault diameter
of an n-dimensional crossed cube were dn/2e + 2. In [29], the crossed cube was shown to be pancyclic. It was

such as regularity, symmetry, small diameter, strong connectivity, recursive construction, partition ability,
and relatively low link complexity [25]. On the other hand, the crossed cube [6,7], which can result by changing
some connections of the hypercube, is superior to the hypercube in diameter and mean distance. The diameter
of an n-dimensional crossed cube is d(n + 1)/2e, which is about one half of the diameter of an n-dimensional
hypercube. The mean distance of the crossed cube is smaller than the hypercube.
The crossed cube has been studied extensively in the literature [3,4,8,11‚Äì13,17,19,20,29]. It was demon-
strated in [19] that a (2n  1)-node complete binary tree can be embedded into a 2n-node crossed cube with
dilation one. The dilation will go up to two if the same tree is embedded into a 2n-node hypercube (see
[28]). Path embedding in the crossed cube can be found in [11,12]. The connectivity of an n-dimensionalThe crossed cube, which is a variation of the hypercube, possesses some properties superior to the hypercube. In this
paper, assuming that each node is incident with at least two fault-free links, we show that an n-dimensional crossed cube
contains a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle, even if there are up to 2n  5 link faults. The result is optimal with respect to the
number of link faults tolerated. We also verify that the assumption is practically meaningful by evaluating its occurrence
probability, which is very close to 1.

5666 H.-S. Hung et al. / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 5664‚Äì5674Notice that (u,v) above is a crossing link of CQd+1, which joins CQ
0
d with CQ
1
d . Such a link is called a d-link.
Every node in CQn is incident with n links, which are 0-link,1-link,2-link, . . ., (n  1)-link. A path (cycle) in a
graph G is called a Hamiltonian path (cycle) if it contains every vertex of G exactly once. The following two
lemmas were shown in [17].
Lemma 1 [17]. A CQn with at most n  2 link faults contains a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle, where nP 3.
Lemma 2 [17]. Suppose that there are fe link faults and fv node faults in a CQn. If fe + fv 6 n  3, then for every
two fault-free nodes u, v of the CQn, there is a fault-free path of length 2
n  fv  1 joining u and v in the CQn,
where nP 3.
In fact, the fault-free path of length 2n  fv  1 in Lemma 2 is a Hamiltonian path in the graph that results
by removing the fv faulty nodes from the CQn.
Fig. 1. CQn. (a) n = 3. (b) n = 4.3. Properties
In this section, some properties of the crossed cube are derived. They will be used when we construct a fault-
free Hamiltonian cycle in a faulty crossed cube, which was described in the next section.
Lemma 3 [20]. Suppose that (u, v) is a d-link in CQn, where d is odd or d = n  2. Then, (cn(u), cn(v)) is also a

For a graph G, we use V(G) (E(G)) to denote the vertex set (edge set) of G. Also we use Px,y to denote a path
between two nodes x, y of the crossed cube.
Lemma 4. Suppose that u, v, x and y are four distinct nodes in CQn, where nP 4. There exist Pu,v and Px,y so
that we have V(Pu,v) \ V(Px,y) = B and V(Pu,v) [ V(Px,y) = V(CQn).
Proof. We prove this lemma by induction on n. For n = 4, the lemma can be easily veriÔ¨Åed by exhaustive
search (by the aid of a computer program) [33]. We assume that the lemma holds for n = kP 4. The situation
of n = k + 1 is discussed with the following four cases.

Fig. 4a.
Case 2: f0 = n  3. By Lemma 1, there is a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle in CQ0n1. Since f0 + f1 + fc 6 n  2,
we have fc 6 1. There is a fault-free (n  1)-link (x,x 0)5 (u,v), where x is neighboring to u in the Hamil-
tonian cycle and x 0 = cn(x). By Lemma 2, there is a fault-free Hamiltonian path between x 0 and v in CQ

n1.
A desired fault-free Hamiltonian cycle can be obtained by the construction method of Fig. 4a.
Case 3: f0 = n  2. We have fc = f1 = 0. Suppose that (x,y) is a faulty link in CQ0n1. There are n  3 link
faults in CQ0n1, exclusive of (x,y). By Lemma 1 (imagining that (x,y) is fault-free), there exists a Hamilto-
nian cycle in that can avoid the n  3 link faults. If (x,y) is not contained in the Hamiltonian cycle, then we
select a fault-free (n  1)-link (t, t 0)5 (u,v), where t is neighboring to u in the Hamiltonian cycle and
t 0 = cn(t). A desired fault-free Hamiltonian cycle can be obtained by the construction method of Fig. 4a.
Otherwise ((x,y) is contained in the Hamiltonian cycle), if x = u, then a desired fault-free Hamiltonian cycle
can be obtained by the construction method of Fig. 4a (replacing (x,x 0) with (y,y 0), where y 0 = cn(y)). If
x5 u, then a desired fault-free Hamiltonian cycle can be constructed as shown in Fig. 4b, where s 62 {x,y}

Theorem 1. With the assumption that each node is incident with at least two fault-free links, there is a fault-free
Hamilton cycle in a CQn with up to 2n  5 link faults, where nP 3. Moreover, the result is optimal with the
respect to the number of link faults tolerated.
4. Proof of Theorem 1
For n = 3, the correctness of the theorem can be assured by Lemma 1. So we assume nP 4. We prove the
theorem by induction. When n = 4, the theorem can be easily veriÔ¨Åed by exhaustive search. We assume that
the theorem holds for n = kP 4. In the rest of this section, the situation of n = k + 1 is considered.
Let fc be the number of faulty crossing links of the CQk+1 and f0(f1) be the number of link faults in
CQ0k CQ

k
 
. We have f0 + f1 + fc 6 2k  3. Without loss of generality, we assume f0P f1. Three cases are dis-
cussed below:
Case 1: f0 6 2k  5. There is at most one node in CQ0k that is incident with only one fault-free link in CQ0k
(the other fault-free link is a crossing link of the CQk+1), for otherwise there are at least 2k  3 link faults in
CQ0k , which is a contradiction.
We Ô¨Årst assume that every node in CQ0 is incident with at least two fault-free links in CQ0. By the induction
5670 H.-S. Hung et al. / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 5664‚Äì5674k k
hypothesis, there exists a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle in CQ0k . A link (s, t) can be found in the Hamiltonian
cycle so that (s, s 0) and (t, t 0) are fault-free, where s 0 = ck+1(s) and t 0 = ck+1(t). In addition, (s, t) should be
selected to be a (k  1)-link if f1 = k  2 (it surely exists because fc 6 1 as f1 = k  2). If f1 6 k  3, then by
Lemma 2 there is a fault-free Hamiltonian path between s 0 and t 0 in CQ1k . If f1 = k  2, then by Lemma 3
(s 0,t 0) is a (k  1)-link, and by Lemma 5 there is a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle in CQ1k that contains (s 0, t 0). A
desired fault-free Hamiltonian cycle can be constructed as shown in Fig. 6a.
Then we assume that a node p in CQ0k is incident with only one fault-free link in CQ
0
k . Hence, we have
f0P k  1 (thus f1 + fc 6 k  2) and (p,p 0) is fault-free, where p 0 = ck+1(p). A faulty link (p,q) with
(q,q 0) fault-free can be found in CQ0k , where q
0 = ck+1(q). In addition, (p,q) should be selected to be a d-link
for some odd d if f1 = k  2 (thus fc = 0). By the induction hypothesis (imagining that (p,q) is fault-free
because p is incident with only one fault-free link in CQ0k), there is a Hamiltonian cycle that can avoid
all faulty links but (p,q) in CQ0k . Notice that (p,q) should be included in the Hamiltonian cycle.
If f1 6 k  3, then by Lemma 2 there exists a fault-free Hamiltonian path between p 0 and q 0 in CQ1k . If
f1 = k  2, then by Lemma 3 (p 0,q 0) is a d-link, and by Lemma 6 there exists a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle
in CQ1k that contains (p
0,q 0). A desired fault-free Hamiltonian cycle can be obtained by the construction
method of Fig. 6a (replacing (s, t) with (p,q)).Fig. 6. Construction of a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle in CQk+1. (a) f0 6 2k  5. (b) f0 = 2k  3.

method of Fig. 6b (replacing (x,y) and (g,h) with (p,q) and (w,z), respectively).
Finally, we show a distribution of 2n  4 link faults over a CQn such that no fault-free Hamiltonian cycle
can be found in the faulty CQn. Let us consider two nodes u = 0
n (n consecutive 0‚Äôs) and v = 0n212 of the
CQn. Refer to Fig. 7 where u and v have their 0-links and 1-links fault-free and the other n  2 links faulty.
It is easy to see that no fault-free Hamiltonian cycle exists in the faulty CQn.
5. The probability
Recall that we have assumed in Theorem 1 that each node in CQn is incident with at least two fault-free
links, while there are up to 2n  5 link faults in the CQn, where nP 3. In this section, we further show that
the assumption is practically meaningful by analyzing its probability when the CQn contains 2n  5 link faults.

sets of G. Stars are bipartite graphs. Throughout this study, the paired terms network and graph, node
and vertex, and link and edge are used interchangeably. The following is a formal deÔ¨Ånition of the star
graph.
DeÔ¨Ånition 1. An n-dimensional star graph is denoted by Sn, which is a graph with V(Sn) = {a1a2  anja1a2  an
is a permutation of 1,2, . . . ,n}, and E(Sn) = {a1a2  anM aia2  ai1a1ai+1  anja1a2  an, aia2   ai1a1ai+1  
an 2 V(Sn) and 2 6 i 6 n}.
Sn has n! nodes in which each node is one permutation of 1,2, . . . ,n. Two nodes are adjacent if and only if
they can be obtained from each other by swapping the leftmost number with one of the other n  1 numbers.
Obviously, Sn is regular of degree n  1. The structures of S1, S2 and S3 are a node, an edge, and a cycle with a
length of six, respectively. The structure of S4 is shown in Fig. 1. For convenience, we say that the edge
between nodes a1a2  an and aia2  ai1a1ai+1  an is along the dimension i, where 2 6 i 6 n. An Sn is a recur-
sive structure that contains many smaller stars, which are referred to as embedded Srs of Sn, where 1 6 r 6 n.
An embedded Sr is conveniently represented by hs1s2  snir, where s1 = *, si 2 {*,1,2, . . . ,n} for all 2 6 i 6 n
and exactly r of s1, s2, . . . , sn are * (* denotes a ‚Äò‚Äòdon‚Äôt care‚Äô‚Äô symbol). For example, h***2i3 represents an
embedded S3 of S4 and contains six nodes 1342, 3142, 4132, 1432, 3412, and 4312. In terms of graph,
h***2i3 is a subgraph of S4 induced by {1342, 3142, 4132, 1432, 3412, 4312}. When r = n, hs1s2  snin repre-
sents Sn. Note that for any i 2 {2, . . . ,n}, Sn consists of n disjoint embedded Sn1s, denoted by h*i1q*niin1
for all q 2 {1,2, . . . ,n}, where *i denotes i consecutive *s. Every embedded Sn1s are connected with the edgesSuppose thatW is an interconnection network. A path (respectively cycle) inW is called aHamiltonian path
(respectively Hamiltonian cycle) if it contains every node ofW exactly once.W is called Hamiltonian if there is
a Hamiltonian cycle in W. A Hamiltonian network can embed a longest cycle with dilation 1, congestion 1,
load 1, and expansion 1. The start graph is Hamiltonian [24]. Since processor or link faults may develop in real
world networks, it is important to consider faulty networks. The problems of diameter [6], routing [9], mul-
ticasting [21], broadcasting [29], gossiping [8], and embedding [11‚Äì13,30] have been solved on various faulty
networks. This study considers the embedding problem on a faulty star graph. Previously related work can
be found in [14‚Äì16,20,27].
It is generally known that the structure of the star graph is more complicated than that of the hypercube.
Therefore, to discuss the Hamiltonicity in the star graph [14‚Äì16,20,27] is more diÔ¨Écult than to discuss the
Hamiltonicity in the hypercube [12,18,26,30]. In [5], Chan and Lee showed that a fault-free Hamiltonian cycle
exists in an n-cube (nP 3) with 62n  5 edge faults in which each node is incident to at least two non-faulty
edges. In this study, we use a very simple method (compared with [5]) to show that a fault-free Hamiltonian
cycle exists in an n-dimensional star graph (nP 4) with 62n  7 edge faults in which each node is incident to
at least two non-faulty edges. Note that the degree of an n-cube is n, and that of n-dimensional star graph is
n  1. Thus, our result is comparable to that of [5].
In the next section, necessary deÔ¨Ånitions and notations are Ô¨Årst introduced. Then, the embedding is shown
in Section 3. In Section 4, we show that the probability to construct a Hamiltonian cycle in an n dimensional
star graph with at most arbitrary 2n  7 edge faults is very close to one. Finally, this paper concludes with
some remarks in Section 5.
2. Preliminaries
For convenience of discussion, a network topology is represented by a simple undirected graph, which is
loopless and without multiple edges. For the graph deÔ¨Ånition and notation, we follow [28]. A graph G is a
triple consisting of a vertex set V(G), an edge set E(G), and a relation that associates with each edge two
vertices called its endpoints. When vertices u and v are the endpoints of an edge, they are adjacent and are
neighbors. In this paper, since all graphs are simple and undirected, we can use uM v to denote the edge thatalong dimension i. If we regard each embedded Sn1 as a supernode, then all embedded Sn1s forms a com-
can be obtained (therefore, there exist a Hamiltonian path between two speciÔ¨Åed nodes). We want to embed a
Hamiltonian cycle in an Sn+1 with 62(n + 1)  7 = 2n  5 faulty edges, in which each node is incident to at
least two healthy edges. First, Sn+1 will be partitioned into n + 1 disjoint Sns such that every node is incident
with at least two healthy edges in each substar. Then, we can combine the paths of each substar into a Ham-
iltonian cycle in the Sn+1. The following lemma shows that such a partition method exists.
Lemma 2. Suppose there are 2n  5 edge faults in Sn+1 and each node is incident to at least two healthy edges,
where nP 3. We can partition Sn+1 over some dimension i 2 {2,3, . . . , n + 1} such that for all q 2 {1,2, . . . ,
n + 1}, each node is incident to at least two healthy edges in h*i1q*n+1iin, and at least one edge along dimension
i is faulty.
Proof. If each node in Sn+1 is incident to at least three healthy edges (i.e., at most n  3 incident edges are
faulty), then the proof is trivial. In the rest of the proof, we assume that at least one node is incident to exactly
two healthy edges (i.e., n  2 incident edges are faulty). Since there are 2n  5 edge faults in Sn+1, there are at
most two nodes in which each is incident to n  2 faulty edges.
When there are exactly two nodes in which each is incident to n  2 faulty edges, let u and v denote these
two nodes. Then, since there are 2n  5 edge faults in Sn+1, u is adjacent to v and uM v is faulty. Assume uM v
is along dimension i (hence, at least one edge along dimension i is faulty). We can partition Sn+1 over
dimension i. Thus, u and v are in different embedded Sns. Suppose u 2 h*i1j*n+1iin and v 2 h*i1k*n+1iin for
some j, k 2 {1,2, . . . ,n + 1} and j5 k. Then (refer to Fig. 2), u (respectively v) is incident to two healthy edges
in h*i1j*n+1iin (respectively h*i1k*n+1iin.) Moreover, each of the other nodes is incident to at least three
healthy edges in Sn+1; hence, for all q 2 {1,2, . . . ,n + 1}, each node is incident to at least two healthy edges in
h*i1q*n+1iin.

4. The probability
In this section, we show that to consider the Hamiltonicity in Sn with 62n  7 edge faults in which each
node is incident to at least two non-faulty edges is meaningful. We want to show that the probability that
Sn is still Hamiltonian after removing arbitrary 2n  7 faulty edges is very high (almost one). It is easy to
see when n = 4, the probability is 1. The following theorem derives the probability that Sn with exactly
2n  7 faulty edges is Hamiltonian, where nP 5.

Proof. According to Theorem 1, the network that remains after removing 2n  7 faulty edges from an Sn in
which each node is incident to at least two non-faulty edges is Hamiltonian. All we have to do is to derive the
probability that each node is incident to at least two non-faulty edges under the condition that exactly 2n  7
edges are faulty in Sn. The total number of ways to choose 2n  7 edges out of all edges is n!  √∞n 1√û=22n 7

iltonian path for h*nimin between um and vm, which is denoted by um () vm for all m 2 {2,3, . . . ,n,n + 1}. The
Hamiltonian cycle for Sn+1 is constructed as Fig. 3.
Case 3. jF \ E(h*nkin)j = 2n  6 for some k 2 {1,2, . . . ,n,n + 1}. Because jFj = 2n  5 and one faulty edge
along dimension n + 1, we have jF \ E(h*nqin)j = 0, for all q 2 {1,2, . . . ,n,n + 1}  {k}. Let u10 $ v10 be a
faulty edge in h*nkin such that the edge along dimension n + 1 incident with u10 (v10 , respectively) is healthy.
Excluding u1
0 $ v10 , there are 2n  7 faulty edges in h*nkin; with the induction hypothesis, there is a
Hamiltonian cycle for h*nkin that contains at most one faulty edge u10 $ v10 . If the Hamiltonian cycle does
not contain u1
0 $ v10 , then we can easily Ô¨Ånd an healthy edge u1M v1 in the Hamiltonian cycle for h*nkin
such that the edge along dimension n + 1 incident with u1 (v1, respectively) is not faulty. Therefore, the
construction of the Hamiltonian cycle of S is the same as Case 2. If the Hamiltonian cycle containsis adjamiltonian cycle for STGn+1(F). Suppose that the Hamiltonian cycle is i1M i2M   M inM in+1M i1
= i1. With similar discussion as Case 1, we can Ô¨Ånd edges v
1M u2,v2M u3, . . . ,vnM un+1, and vn+1M u1
that they are healthy and along dimension n + 1, where um,vm 2 V(h*nimin), and um and vm are in differentWe claim that there exists an edge u1M v1 in the Hamiltonian cycle for h*nkin such that the edge along dimen-
sion n + 1 incident with u1 (v1, respectively) is not faulty. Since there are n! edges in the Hamiltonian cycle for
h*nkin, we have at least n! choices. If none of edges in the Hamiltonian cycle for h*nkin meet the requirements
of such an edge u1M v1, then there are at least dn!/2e faulty edges along dimension n + 1. (This is because a
faulty edge along dimension n + 1 eliminates two edges in the Hamiltonian cycle for h*nkin.) Moreover, since
jF \ E(h*nkin)jP n  2, there are at most 2n  5  (n  2) = n  3 faulty edges along dimension n + 1.
Additionally, dn!/2e = n!/2 > n  3 for nP 4. This contradicts the fact that there are at most n  3 faulty
edges along dimension n + 1. Therefore, we can always Ô¨Ånd such a edge u1M v1 in the Hamiltonian cycle
for h*nkin. Let u1 () v1 denote the Hamiltonian path for h*nkin. Clearly, jEi;j√∞Sn√æ1√û \ F j 6 n 3 < √∞√∞n√æ1√û2√û!2
