argue that the bounds of uncertain data (i.e., determining the closed intervals to bound the possible
observed data) are easier to be handled than specifying the Gaussian distributions in stochastic
optimization problems.
The duality theory for inexact linear programming problem was proposed by Soyster [10, 11, 12]
and Thuente [14]. Falk [3] provided some properties on this problem. However, Pomerol [7] pointed
out some drawbacks of Soyster’s results and also provided some mild conditions to improve Soyster’s
results. Rohn [8] also discussed the duality in interval linear programming problem with real-valued
objective function. Now, we shall discuss the duality in interval-valued linear programming problem
with interval-valued objective function using the solution concept which is different from that of
the mentioned literature . The interval-valued linear programming problem proposed here is closely
related with the inexact linear programming problem. The main difference between those two prob-
lems are the solutions concepts imposed upon the objective functions. The solution concept in
the inexact linear programming problem used the conventional solution concept in the scalar linear
programming problems. The solution concept of interval-valued linear programming problems pro-
posed here follows from the similar concept of nondominated solution in multiobjective programming
problems by defining a partial ordering on the set of all closed intervals. On the other hand, the
primal and dual interval-valued linear programming problem are formulated by proposing a concept
of scalar product for closed intervals, which is a new attempt and is different from that of inexact
linear programming problem.
As we have known, the optimal objective value of conventional linear programming problem is
a real number, since the ordering used in the set of all real numbers is a total ordering. However,
the ordering proposed in this report on the set of all closed intervals is a partial ordering. We define
the solution concept according to the notion of nondominated solution (i.e., the Pareto optimal
solution) in multiobjective programming problem. In this case, the optimal objective values of
interval-valued linear programming problem will become a set consisting of nondominated objective
values. Therefore we also define an ordering to compare the optimal objective values of primal
and dual interval-valued linear programming problems. Under these settings, the weak and strong
duality theorems are derived.
3 Research Methodology
Let Kc(R) denote the class of all nonempty, compact and convex subsets of R. Let A,B ∈ Kc(R).
Then A+B is defined by A+B = {a+b : a ∈ A and b ∈ B} and−A is defined by−A = {−a : a ∈ A}.
Therefore, A−B = A+ (−B).
Let us denote by I the class of all closed and bounded intervals in R. Throughout this report,

Definition 3.1 The scalar product of A and B in In is defined by
〈〈A,B〉〉 = (A1 ⊗B1)⊕ · · · ⊕ (An ⊗Bn).
It is easy to see that the scalar product 〈〈A,B〉〉 is also a closed interval. Therefore, using equation
(1), we have
〈〈A,B〉〉L = (A1 ⊗B1)L + · · ·+ (An ⊗Bn)L and 〈〈A,B〉〉U = (A1 ⊗B1)U + · · ·+ (An ⊗Bn)U .
Also, using equation (2), we can obtain the more detailed formulas for 〈〈A,B〉〉L and 〈〈A,B〉〉U . We
omit the detailed description here.
We say that A is nonnegative (resp. nonpositive) if each Ai is nonnegative (resp. nonpositive)
for i = 1, · · · , n. The following result is not hard to prove.
Proposition 3.1 Let A and B be in In. If A is nonnegative or nonpositive, then
〈〈A,B〉〉 = 〈〈A,B+〉〉 ⊕ 〈〈A,B−〉〉.
Let a ∈ R. Then a can be regarded as a closed interval Aa = [a, a]. Let B be a closed
interval. When we write a ⊕ B and a ⊗ B, we shall mean Aa ⊕ B and Aa ⊗ B, respectively.
Now let a = (a1, · · · , an) ∈ Rn. Then a can also be regarded as an element Aa in In by setting
Aa = (Aa1 , · · · , Aan) = ([a1, a1], · · · , [an, an]). For notational convenience, when we write 〈〈a,B〉〉,
we will mean the scalar product 〈〈Aa,B〉〉. Let us write 〈·, ·〉 to denote the usual inner (scalar)
product in Rn. Using Proposition 3.1, we also have the following useful proposition for the further
discussions.
Proposition 3.2 Let B be in In. Suppose that a ∈ Rn is nonnegative or nonpositive.
(i) 〈〈a,B〉〉 = 〈〈a,B+〉〉 ⊕ 〈〈a,B−〉〉.
(ii) If a is nonnegative, then 〈〈a,B〉〉L = 〈a,BL〉 and 〈〈a,B〉〉U = 〈a,BU 〉.
(iii) If a is nonpositive, then 〈〈a,B〉〉L = 〈a,BU 〉 and 〈〈a,B〉〉U = 〈a,BL〉.
Let A = [aL, aU ] and B = [bL, bU ] be two closed intervals in R. We write
A  B if and only if aL ≤ bL and aU ≤ bU . (3)
It means that A is inferior to B, or B is superior to A. It is easy to see that “” is a partial ordering
on I. We also write A ≺ B if and only if A  B and A 6= B. Equivalently, A ≺ B if and only if{
aL < bL
aU ≤ bU or
{
aL ≤ bL
aU < bU
or
{
aL < bL
aU < bU

Subject to (A1j ⊗ y1)⊕ · · · ⊕ (Amj ⊗ ym)  Cj for j = 1, · · · , n
y1, · · · , ym ≥ 0,
where the decision variables y1, · · · , ym are assuming values on R.
We call the above problem (D) as the dual interval-valued linear programming problem, and it
can be rewritten as a compact form using the scalar product of closed intervals as follows:
(D) Maximize 〈〈B,y〉〉
Subject to 〈〈A·j ,y〉〉  Cj for j = 1, · · · , n
y ≥ 0,
or
(D) Maximize 〈〈B,y〉〉
Subject to yA  C
y ≥ 0.
Similarly, we let
Y = {y : 〈〈A·j ,y〉〉  Cj for j = 1, · · · , n and y ≥ 0} = {y : yA  C and y ≥ 0}
be the feasible region of the dual problem (D), and adopt the following notation
maxD(A,B,C) ≡ {〈〈B,y∗〉〉 : there exists no y ∈ Y such that 〈〈B,y∗〉〉 ≺ 〈〈B,y〉〉}.
We say that y∗ is a solution of dual problem (D) if 〈〈B,y∗〉〉 ∈ maxD(A,B,C).
4 Results and Discussions
In the sequel, we are going to investigate the weak and strong duality theorems and the complemen-
tary slackness for interval-valued linear programming problem.
Now we are going to derive the weak duality theorem. For convenience, we firstly introduce some
notations. Let H be a set of closed intervals and K be a closed interval. We write H  K if and
only if H  K for all H ∈ H. Let H and K be two sets of closed intervals. We write H  K if and
only if H  K for all K ∈ K.
Theorem 4.1 (Weak Duality Theorem) Let x and y be the feasible solutions of primal and dual
problems (P) and (D), respectively. Then
〈〈C,x〉〉  〈〈B,y〉〉.

Theorem 4.5 Suppose that one of the following condition is satisfied:
(i) there exists a feasible solution y¯ of dual problem (D) such that 〈〈B, y¯〉〉 ∈ F (X);
(ii) there exists a feasible solution x¯ of primal problem (P) such that 〈〈C, x¯〉〉 ∈ G(Y ).
Then problems (P) and (D) have no duality gap.
Let A be an interval matrix. We write AL (resp. AU ) as a matrix whose (i, j)-th entry is (Aij)L
(resp. (Aij)U ). Now we are concerned with the lower- and upper-level linear programming problems
of primal problem (P):
(PL) Minimize 〈CL,x〉
Subject to ALx ≥ BL
x ≥ 0
and
(PU ) Minimize 〈CU ,x〉
Subject to AUx ≥ BU
x ≥ 0.
We also have the lower- and upper-level linear programming problems of dual problem (D):
(DL) Maximize 〈BL,y〉
Subject to yAL ≤ CL
y ≥ 0
and
(DU ) Maximize 〈BU ,y〉
Subject to yAU ≤ CU
y ≥ 0.
We see that problems (PL), (PU ), (DL), and (DU ) are the traditional linear programming prob-
lems. It is evident that (DL) is the dual problem of (PL), and (DU ) is the dual problem of (PU ).
For further discussions, we introduce the following notations.
(optmP (A,B,C))L ≡ the set of all finite optimal solutions of problem (PL)
(optmP (A,B,C))U ≡ the set of all finite optimal solutions of problem (PU )
optmP (A,B,C) = (optmP (A,B,C))L ∩ (optmP (A,B,C))U .
Similarly, we have
(optmD(A,B,C))L ≡ the set of all finite optimal solutions of problem (DL)
(optmD(A,B,C))U ≡ the set of all finite optimal solutions of problem (DU )
optmD(A,B,C) = (optmD(A,B,C))L ∩ (optmD(A,B,C))U .
Proposition 4.1 We have the following properties.
(i) If x∗ ∈ optmP (A,B,C), then 〈〈C,x∗〉〉  〈〈C,x〉〉 for all x ∈ X, i.e., x∗ is a solution of
primal problem (P) and 〈〈C,x∗〉〉 ∈ minP (A,B,C).
(ii) If y∗ ∈ optmD(A,B,C), then 〈〈B,y∗〉〉  〈〈B,y〉〉 for all y ∈ Y , i.e., y∗ is a solution of dual
problem (D) and 〈〈B,y∗〉〉 ∈ maxD(A,B,C).
Theorem 4.6 (Strong Duality Theorem) Suppose that optmP (A,B,C) and optmD(A,B,C) are
nonempty sets. Then problems (P) and (D) have no duality gap.
