二、  計畫英文摘要  
Integration of GaAs on Si substrate III-V high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) for 
next generation lower power logic circuit application was study. SiGe metamorphic buffer layers 
will be used for the growth of III-V material on the Si substrate and the devices will be fabricated 
in this project. For the III-V on the Si substrate epitaxy, a Ge layer will first be grown on the SiGe 
metamorphic buffer layer before the III-V material growth. SiGe metamorphic buffer layer with 
Ge layer on top of the III-V structure is proposed, because Ge is only 0.07% lattice mismatched 
with GaAs, and the thermal expansion coefficient difference between Ge and GaAs is only 2%, 
i.e. the lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficients of Ge are almost identical as those for 
GaAs. Using Ge/SiGe metamorphic structure as the buffer layer can solve the thermal expansion 
mismatch and the lattice mismatch problems of the interface between GaAs and Si. After the 
GaAs epilayer growth, III-V quantum well based device structure of InGaAs and InAs will be 
grown on the Si substrate.  
In this study, we will grow the III-V based metamorphic quantum well device on the proposed 
GaAs on Si template with SiGe buffer. The SiGe buffer layer will be grown using UHV-CVD 
technology, the GaAs buffer layer will be grown by MOCVD and the III-V based channel 
structure will be grown by MBE technology. InAs HEMT structure with mobility as high as 
27,300cm

/V·s has been grown on the proposed SiGe/Si. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that 
using Si substrate not only will reduce device produce cost but also increase device mobility by 
strain relaxed between Si substrate and channel layer. Al0.12Ga0.88As/In.18Ga.82As 
high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) growth on a Si substrate using the Ge/GexSi1-x buffer is 
demonstrated. The electron mobility in the In0.18Ga0.82As channel of the HEMT sample was 3,550 
cm
2
/(V·s). After fabrication, the HEMT device demonstrated a saturation current of 150 mA/mm 
with a transconductance of 155 mS/mm.

(100) toward the <110> direction was implanted with Si
+
 ions at a dose of 5×10
15
 cm
－2 
and an 
acceleration voltage of 50 keV. After implantation, the wafer was cleaned by 10% HF dipping 
and was baked at 800℃ in the growth chamber for 5 min. Then, a 0.2 μm Ge0.8Si0.2 layer, a 0.25 
μm Ge0.9Si0.1 layer, and a 0.55 μm Ge layer were grown on the substrate at 400℃ in this sequence. 
Between successive layers, growth was interrupted in situ for 15 min annealing at 750℃. The 
compositions of the GexSi1-x layers were carefully designed so that the stress at the interfaces can 
effectively block the dislocations from propagating into the upper layers. After the Ge layer was 
grown, the dislocation density in the Ge film was determined to be 7.6×10
6 
cm
-2
 by X-ray 
measurement. After the Ge layer growth, the sample was switched to a LP-MOCVD system to 
grow the AlGaAs/InGaAs HEMT structure on the Ge/Ge0.9Si0.1/Ge0.8Si0.2/Si heterostructure. 
The InGaAs channel layer was grown at 590℃, the AlGaAs layer and the GaAs layer were 
grown at 620℃ and the growth pressure was 40 Torr. Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional 
transmission electron microscopy of the HEMT structure grown on the Si substrate. The device 
structure was composed of 150 Å  undoped In0.18Ga0.82As channel layer, 40 Å  undoped 
Al0.12Ga0.88As spacer layer, 320 Å  Al0.12Ga0.88As Schottky layer with doping concentration of 
5.34×10

 and 200 Å  GaAs cap layer with a doping concentration of 2×10

. The 
inserted image is the lattice image of the InGaAs channel of HEMT grown on the Si substrate. 
For comparison, the same HEMT structure was grown on a Ge substrate. The HEMT epi 
structures on the Ge substrate and on the Si substrate were grown by MOCVD with the same 
procedures and the wafers were processed together.    
For the HEMT device fabrication, the mesa was isolated was done by wet chemical etching. 
Ohmic contacts were formed by evaporating Au/Ge/Ni/Au (20/40/14/180 nm) on the n
+ 
GaAs 
layer and then alloyed at 350
o
C by rapid thermal annealing (RTA). For T-gate definition, the bi 
layer resist structure consisting of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and PMMA-methacrylic 
acid (PMMA-MAA) were exposed by E-beam lithography with footprint of 0.4 m. Citrate 
acid/H2O/H2O2 solution were used for the gate recess process. Ti/Pt/Au (100/100/300 nm) was 
deposited as the Schottky metal for the T-shaped gate. After T-gate formation, 100-nm-thick 
silicon nitride film was deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) as 
the passivation layer. 
For isolation etch, the HEMT structure was etched 300 nm down to the AlGaAs buffer layer. 
After the isolation etch, the HEMT structure demonstrated a leakage current of 0.016 A/m 
when the bias voltage was up to 14.2 V as measured by the isolation pattern with a pad spacing of 
10 m, as shown in Fig. 3. If the antiphase boundaries (APBs) formed at the GaAs/Ge interface, 
Ge atoms could diffuse along the antiphase boundaries into the GaAs layers during the growth 
process, and act as dopant atoms in the GaAs layers. Both the APB formation and the Ge 
diffusion into the GaAs layers will affect the isolation and result in the increased leakage current 
and influence the pinch-off characteristics of the devices 
1,2)
. The isolation data indicate that the 
use of the 6
o
-off Si substrate had efficiently suppressed the APB formation and the Ge diffusion 
into the GaAs layer, and the qualities of the AlGaAs/GaAs buffer layer and the Ge/GexSi1-x buffer 
layer were sufficiently good for device application.

There are two problems to be overcome for the growth of high-quality Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs 
HEMT epitaxial layers on Si substrate. One is the strain induced by the large lattice mismatch of 
11 % between the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure and the Si substrate, the other is the residual 
stress due to the large difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of these two material 
systems.
13)
 To obtain high-quality the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT on Si, two buffer layers of 
Ge/Ge0.95Si0.05/Ge0.9Si0.1 and Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/AlSb/GaAs were used. First, the 
Ge/Ge0.95Si0.05/Ge0.9Si0.1 layer was used as the buffer layer for the growth of GaAs on Si substrate, 
because Ge and GaAs have similar lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients.
13)
 Then, 
the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/AlSb layers were grown to accommodate the strain induced by the large lattice 
mismatch between the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs system and the GaAs layer.10 The crystalline quality of 
the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure grown on Si was analyzed by X-ray diffraction analysis, 
transmission electron microscopy(TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The thickness of 
the epitaxial layers, the dislocation distribution and the threading dislocation density were 
evaluated using the above analytical tools. A very high room-temperature electron mobility of 
27,300cm
2
/V·sec and a sheet density of 3.04 × 1012/cm2 for the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT 
structure grown on the Si substrate was obtained.    
The Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs structure grown on Si is as shown in Figure 1. A Si (100) substrate 
wafer with 60 off-cut toward the [110] direction and three epitaxial growth systems were used for 
the growth of the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure on Si in this study. First, an ultra-high 
vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV/CVD) system was used to grow the 
Ge/Ge0.95Si0.05/Ge0.9Si0.1 layers. Then, a thin GaAs film was grown by a commercial metal 
organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).13 Finally, the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure 
was grown by a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. 
For the Ge/Ge0.95Si0.05/Ge0.9Si0.1 layers growth, the Si substrate was first cleaned by 10% HF 
dipping and then went through high-temperature baking at 8000C in the growth chamber for 5 
minutes. Then, a 0.8µm Si0.1Ge0.9 layer, a 0.8µm Si0.05Ge0.95 layer, and a 1.0µm Ge layer were 
grown at 400
0
C in sequence on the Si wafer as the buffer layer.
13)
 After that, a 1.5µm GaAs layer 
was grown on Ge at a temperature of 600
0
C by MOCVD. The growth conditions of GaAs are as 
follow: growth pressure is 40 torr, V/III ratio is 100 and growth rate is 1.7µm/hour. 
13
 Finally, the 
Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT was grown on top of the Ge layer by MBE system and the wafer was 
baked at 630
0
C for 1 min before the growth. The growth of the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT 
structure can be divided into two major parts: buffer layer growth and InAs channel layer growth.  
The growth of the buffer layers includes a GaAs layer, an AlSb layer, two GaSb/AlSb 
supperlattice and two Al0.5Ga0.5Sb layers, the buffer layers were grown before the channel region 
to accommodate the 7% lattice mismatch between the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure and the 
Ge layer. The growth temperature of the buffer layers was set at 560
0
C. A 1 µm GaAs layer was 
10 
 
diffraction patterns of the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure on Si substrate wafer exhibited 
clearly seven major peaks and the diffracted peaks indicated that the crystalline quality of the 
HEMT structure was very good. The room-temperature electron mobility of 27,300cm
2
/Vsec and 
a sheet density of 3.04×10
12
/cm
2
 were achieved for the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT grown on Si 
substrate using Ge/Ge0.95Si0.05/Ge0.9Si0.1 as the buffer layer. This is the highest mobility for a 
HEMT structure grown on Si substrate reported so far and we have demonstrated that a 
very-high-mobility Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure can be grown on Si substrate if the buffer 
layers are properly designed. 
The growth of the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) epitaxial 
structure on the Si substrate is investigated. Buffer layers consisted of UHV/CVD-grown 
Ge/GeSi and MBE-grown Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/AlSb/GaAs were used to accommodate the strain induced 
by the large lattice mismatch between the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure and the Si substrate. 
The crystalline quality of the structure grown was examined by XRD, TEM, and AFM. Finally, 
very high room-temperature electron mobility of 27,300cm
2
/Vsec was achieved. It is 
demonstrated that a very-high-mobility Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure on the Si substrate can 
be achieved with the properly designed buffer layers.

(c)在提升 Al0.5Ga0.5As/InAs 高電子遷移率電晶體之電子遷移率的研究 : 
Mobility improvement by lattice mismatch induced strain for InAs high electron mobility 
transistor (HEMT) structure is investigated. The Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure was grown 
on both GaAs and Si substrates. It was found that the lattice mismatch induced strain trends to 
enhance the mobility of the carriers in the 2 DEG channel of the InAs HEMT structure. The 
crystalline quality of the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT devices on both GaAs and Si substrate were 
examined by X-ray diffraction and TEM analysis, and the induced strain was also analyzed by 
X-ray analysis. Very high room-temperature electron mobility of 27,300cm
2
/Vsec was achieved 
for the strained Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT grown on the Si substrate which is higher than the 
electron mobility of 23,104cm
2
/Vsec observed for the same InAs HEMT structure grown on the 
GaAs substrate with less lattice mismatch. This result indicates that the performance of the InAs 
HEMT can be enhanced using lattice mismatch induced strain. 
The Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs structure grown on GaAs is shown in Figure 1(b). The growth 
temperature of the GaAs buffer layers was set at 560
0
C. A 1 μm GaAs layer was grown on GaAs 
substrate first. Then, a 100nm AlSb layer, a superlattice of 50nm with 10 pairs of GaSb/AlSb and 
a 1μm Al0.5Ga0.5Sb were grown layer by layer. After that, 50nm GaSb/AlSb superlattice (10 
pairs), a 50nm Al0.5Ga0.5Sb layer, a 15nm InAs layer, a 13nm Al0.5Ga0.5Sb layer and a 3nm GaSb 
layer were grown. To obtain good quality InAs channel layer, the growth temperature was set at 
450
0
C after the growth of the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb layer. 
The quality of the structure of the layer was investigated by analytical tools. The lattice 
mismatch, the composition and crystalline quality were derived from the X-ray diffraction 
rocking curves. This transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples were prepared by using 
the standard “sandwich” technique followed by ion milling for this study. Structural analyses of 
16 
 
misfit dislocations at the interface between the AlSb layer and the GaAs layer by using Si 
substrate with 6
0
 off (100) toward to [110]. The tilted substrate increases the elastic deformation 
and induces the atoms migration at low temperatures. The dislocation climb necessary for the 
sessile configuration to move, is not possible and dislocations cannot be produced at the island 
surface once it is far from the interface. 
Fig. 2 (b) shows that the FWHM of the InAs channel on a Si substrate is about 358 arcsec. 
The FWHM of the InAs channel on a GaAs substrate is about 506 arcsec. The improved results 
on tilted substrate can be attributed part to the fact that tilted surfaces have steps terminated with 
In. As incident on the surface can form three bonds, two to the In atoms on the surface, and one to 
the In atom on the (111) face of the step.
3)
 The lateral steps might arise from the initiation of InAs 
epitaxial layer at the step edges on the misoriented substrate, they might also be enhanced by 
lateral and vertical segregation of In atoms to improve the film quality.
4)
 When the film exceeds a 
crystal thickness, misfit dislocation are introduced, possibly as half-loops from the surface, or as 
loops nucleated at a defect near the interface. This asymmetry in dislocation density can be 
explained by the asymmetry in the dislocations glide force on the two (111) slip plane caused by 
the interfacial misorientation. Glide of the dislocations glide force on the two (111) slip planes 
caused by the interfacial misorientation. Glide of the dislocation into the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb buffer layer 
tends to be more effective releasing the vertical component of tensile stress in the InAs channel 
layer. The stress fields caused by the steps is quite strong but decay rapidly with distance from the 
step, so the dislocation will not be pushed deeply into the InAs channel layer, but will locate 
within a few angstorms from the interface.  
According to the high resolution TEM image shown in Fig. 4, the lattice image shows dark 
areas between Al0.5Ga0.5Sb interface and the InAs channel layer, which are areas with high strain 
energy. The lattice constant of InAs layer is smaller than the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb layer. The large lattice 
mismatch cause high strain energy. This results in the tensile strain in the InAs layer and 
compressive strain in the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb layer. This result explains why the position of InAs peak at 
DC x-ray measurement shift 341 arcsec to Al0.5Ga0.5Sb peak. The dislocation of several lattices at 
the interface between the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb layer and InAs layer was observed. In addition, the Hall 
measurement shows the electron mobility of 27,300cm
2
/Vs with carrier concentration of 
3.04х1012 cm-2 and the electron mobility of 23,014cm2/Vs with carrier concentration of 1.45х1012 
cm
-2
 for the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb/InAs HEMT structure on Si substrate and GaAs substrate, respectively. 
The tensile strain in the InAs layer for the Al0.5Ga0.5Sb /InAs on Si substrate wafer results in 
device mobility enhancement.

 and the large conduction band offset 
for InAs channel is suitable for QWFETs applications. 
 Mesa etching was performed to provide isolated active areas by using 
phosphoric/H2O2/H2O. Low ohmic metallization was formed and showed a specific 
contact resistance of ~ 1.5 × 10
-7
 Ω cm2 after rapid thermal annealing at 250 oC for 25 
sec in a forming gas condition. A tri-layer resist system of ZEP-520/PMGI/ZEP520 
was used for the E-Beam lithography and the gate length of the T-shaped gate was 80 
nm. Gate recessing was carried out in the mixture of succinic acid/H2O2 solution. 
Besides, the recess must be controlled precisely which is the most critical step in 
fabricating the QWFETs (7). After gate recess, the Pt (12nm)/Ti (60nm)/Pt 
(80nm)/Au (180nm) were deposited as Schottky gate metal and lifted off using 
ZDMAC remover (ZEON Corporation) to form 80-nm T-shaped gate. The scanning 
electron microscope (SEM) images of the device and the T-shaped gate are shown in 
the Fig. 2 (a) and (b), respectively.  
 
Result and Discussion 
The drain–source current IDS versus drain–source voltage VDS curves and the 
transconductance gm versus gate–source voltage VGS curves of the 80-nm gate InAs 
QWFETs are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b) respectively. The 2 ×  50-μm-wide device 
exhibited good pinchoff characteristics, and the device is a depletion mode with a 
threshold voltage (VT) of −0.81 V. The current density IDS was 1015 mA/mm. The 
maximum gm of the device at a VDS of 0.5 V was 1920 mS/mm. The high 
transconductance was due to low contact resistances, high carrier concentration and 
superior electron transport properties in the InAs channel. The result indicates that the 
InAs-channel QWFETs can be operated at low bias condition to reduce dc power 
dissipation while maintaining high performance. Additionally, these devices 
performing faster switching speed and better on-current performances than Si 
transistors will play an important role on future logic devices. 
The S-parameters for the InAs QWFETs were measured from 2 to 80 GHz using 
on-wafer 100-μm-pitch ground–signal–ground probes. The current gain cutoff 
frequency was defined by extrapolating the H21 curve at a slope of 20 dB/dec. Fig. 4 
(a) shows the frequency at different VDS as a function of current density and fig. 4 (b) 
shows the fT dependence of the current gain H21, the power gain “MAG/MSG,” and 
the unilateral gain U of the InAs devices measured at VDS = 0.4 V and VGS = − 0.45 
V. The current gain cut-off frequency fT and the maximum oscillation frequency fmax
