三、報告內容 
 
(一)、前言 
 
In recent years, the widespread application of solid-state control of ac power increases the 
harmonic-related problems in the utility and power systems. In addition, many power 
facilities are inductive which induces undesirable harmonics and reactive power in the power 
systems.  
In order to eliminate harmonic contamination due to nonlinear loads, use of a converter 
with power factor correction ability becomes popular in recent decades. An ideal ac/dc 
converter (rectifier) takes energy from ac source and delivers steady power source to dc load 
with unity power factor. Traditionally, devices such as thyristors permit control of rectifier 
circuit. These phase-controlled ac/dc converters suffer from the drawbacks such as low power 
factor and high harmonics distortion in line current. Although thyristor–controlled ac/dc 
converters are simple in installation, the harmonics pollution and reactive power caused by 
these devices could damage the electronics equipments in the power system. 
Also, the harmonics in power system decrease the transmission efficiency of the power 
line and deteriorate power quality. Furthermore, except for rectifying, the need of 
regenerating ability in power converters complicates the circuit topology of the 
thyristor-based rectifier, which increases the size and cost of this type of rectifier. As 
alternatives, three-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) ac/dc boost converters have been 
considered as useful elements for power-factor correction in many industrial applications 
[1]-[2], due to their attractive features such as high power factor, nearly sinusoidal input 
current and bidirectional power flow ability. Thus, the control of PWM ac/dc boost converters 
has recently received much attention in achieving satisfactory performances. 
A major topic in recent research has been on performance improvement under unbalanced 
ac supply condition. According the report of [10]-[16], unbalance in input ac voltages causes 
an abnormal harmonic at dc bus and this in turn yields a (nonzero sequence) third-order 
harmonic component in the input line current. Therefore, the performance of the controller 
designed with balanced ac supply assumption is severely deteriorated. There are many 
situations that could cause unbalance in three-phase supply, such as: non-uniform distribution 
of single-phase loads, use of non-symmetrical transformer winding, unbalanced transmission 
impedance per phase, and influences subjected to fault or damage in the transmission 
network.

(二)、文獻探討 
 
In controlling the ac/dc converters, nonlinear methods [3]-[8] have recently received much 
attention in order to achieve global stability under large parameter variation and perturbation 
in load. In the work of [3], a Lyapunov-based scheme was proposed to synthesize a globally 
stable controller. As the controller realization requires knowledge of the equilibrium points at 
steady state, which depends on circuit parameters and load resistance, there may exist 
steady-state errors in the state variables. Vilathgamuwa et al. [4] adopt a two-time-scale 
approach to conduct sliding mode technique, in which dc-bus voltage dynamics are indirectly 
regulated through sliding modes. The input-output feedback linearization [5] and 
passivity-based controller [6]-[7] can not adjust the dc bus voltage directly due to the inherent 
non-minimum property. Instead, a cascade (inner-outer loop) control structure is adopted to 
indirectly regulate the dc bus voltage with d-axis current. In these inner-outer loop schemes, 
the PI controller is commonly adopted for the voltage loop. As integral action generally 
introduces lagging effects, the response time is usually long. In contrast, a state feedback 
design via extended linearization is reported in [8] for achieving direct dc-bus voltage 
capability without using an inner-outer loop control structure. Although a fast tracking 
response is accomplished by this approach, the lack of integral action in controller makes the 
system suffer from the robustness issue and non-zero residual tracking error. In [9], the 
authors proposed a new model for three-phase PWM boost converters based on power 
balancing between ac and dc sides.  With a nonlinear transform on dc-bus voltage, a linear 
state feedback control design is applied to the linearized model. Since the load uncertainty 
appears as an unmatched term in the model, the robustness in load perturbation had not been 
considered. Also, in their work, the control variables are the control voltages that feed into the 
switching power devices rather than the switching functions. Hence the nonlinearities 
presented at the control variables are ignored.  
As regard to performance enhancement in face of unbalanced ac supply, Rioual et al. [11] 
derive a generalized model in a-b-c frame and current commands with second-order 
harmonics components for both positive and negative sequence current controller, which 
require a higher bandwidth to achieve current tracking [12]. In the synchronously rotating 
frame (SRF), Song and Nam [12] decomposed the proportional-integral (PI) controller for 
line currents into two parts: the positive- and negative-sequence ones. The PI controller in 
positive-sequence SRF regulates the positive-sequence line currents and the PI controller in

I. Mathematical Model of the Three-Phase AC/DC Boost Converters 
A. Balanced three phase ac supply 
The power circuit of the three phase ac/dc boost converter under consideration is shown in 
Fig. 1. Under a balanced three phase ac supply, neglecting the resistance of the power 
switches, the dynamic model of the boost rectifier in synchronous d-q rotating coordinate may 
be expressed as [3], [5]:

unbalanced ac supply condition, the back-emf components dE  and qE  are slowly varying, 
the closed loop system may be stabilized by a suitably designed adaptive controller [23].  
 
II. Controller Design 
A. Control Objective 
The controller are designed to achieve dc-bus voltage tracking and unity power factor. 
Equivalently, dc-bus voltage 1x   is regulated to a given dc reference voltage 
2
dc, refv and 
q-axis current 3x  tracks its reference command 3rx . When the unbalanced power supply is 
equipped, to attenuate the harmonic component in line currents and dc-bus voltage, the q-axis 
current command, 3rx  is generated from the positive and negative sequence components of 
input voltages and currents in the d-axis of the synchronous frame as shown in Fig. 2. In this 
synchronous frame, pdE  is always located on the dE -axis and 
n
dE  is rotating in the counter 
direction against to pdE  with a difference angle of nθθ +2 . Then the average power may be 
calculated from 
( )ndndpdpd iEiEP += 230  (13) 
where nd
p
d ii  and are positive and negative sequence components of input currents in the d-axis 
of the synchronous frame. Now, the q-axis current command is given by [17]

From the control point of view, modeling the boost converter in the rotating d-q frame has 
the advantage of reducing the current control task (which sinusoidal tracking control is 
required) into a set-point tracking problem. However, one must note that the state equations 
(11)-(12) are of nonlinear nature since the control inputs dp  and qp   are multiplied by 
state variables. 
 
B. Adaptive Backstepping Controller Design 
In most case, the load resistance LR  remains unknown in advance. With the consideration 
of  unbalance in the three-phase power supply, the uncertainties in dE  and qE  are also 
assumed to be unknown. To achieve dc-bus voltage regulation and unity power factor under

where 321  and  ,    γγγ  are the adaptation gains. The positive constants 1β , 2β  and 3β  are 
design parameters.  The derivative of the Lyapuov function with respect to time becomes 
 11
From the definition of the Lyapunov function 0)( ≥tV  and (36), the integration satisfies 
∞<≤∫∞→ (0)) (0),()d(lim 0 θττ zVMtt . 
This shows that 21   , zz  and 3z  converge to zero as ∞→t . Hence, the goals of dc-bus 
voltage regulation and unity power factor have been achieved despite the uncertainty in load. 
The overall control structure of the proposed adaptive backstepping controller for the boost 
converter is shown in Fig. 3. 
Since dix =2  and in view of (9), the error variable 2z  may be considered as an estimate 
of the difference of the supplied power on the ac side and the absorbed power on the dc side. 
Indeed, when the system is at steady state, 2z  converges to zero. From (16) we have

in load is shown in Fig. 7. The phase currents and a-phase voltage at ac side are plotted in Fig. 
8. As compare these waveforms to the results of Lyapunov approach in [3] and extended 
linearization in [8], our approach can result in zero tracking error. Also, while subjecting to 
load disturbance, a small dip (less than 10 volts) and quick recovery (about 0.025 sec.) in 
dc-bus voltage are observed. This demonstrates that the proposed controller yields both fast 
dynamic response and strong robustness. From the steady-state phase currents and voltage on 
the ac side shown in Fig. 8, it is observed that the power factor is almost unity and the source 
currents are nearly sinusoidal waves. These results evidence the salient performance of the 
proposed design. 
The performance of the proposed controller is then tested under an unbalanced ac supply. 
The peak value of the b-phase voltage is dropped to 50V and the other phase voltages are kept 
at 80V. In this case, the back-emf components, dE  and qE , are no longer constants and thus 
we must adapt the parameters 2θ  and 3θ . The adaptation gains for these two parameters are 
-9

-8
2 108 and 10 ×==   γγ . Except for 32  and    γγ , the parameters of the backstepping 
controllers are the same as those of the case for balanced ac supply and listed in (39). Due the 
limitation of the power of the three-phase ac power supply (Type: Chroma 61702), which is 
used for deliberately generating an unbalance three-phase ac supply, the load resistance is 
increased to 50Ω. In this case, the adaptations of the three parameters, 1ˆθ , 2ˆθ  and 3ˆθ  are 
given in Fig. 9. For comparison and to exhibit the improvement of the performance of the 
proposed controller under unbalanced ac supply, the experimental results of both the proposed 
controller without unbalanced compensation (i.e. 0   32 ==   γγ ) and with unbalanced 
compensation (i.e. -93
-8
2 108 and 10 ×==   γγ ) are presented in Fig. 10 and 11, respectively. 
The ripple of the controller with unbalanced compensation is reduced as compared to that of 
the controller without unbalanced compensation. A significant improvement can be observed. 
Also, observing the current waveforms in Fig. 10 and 11, the controller with unbalanced 
compensation also yields better responses. This is further evidenced from the measured THD 
of these current waveforms listed in Table 2. Thus, this demonstrates the effectiveness of the 
proposed adaptive backstepping controller in reducing the ripple in dc-link voltage and line 
current harmonics due to unbalance in three-phase input power supply.

Abstract-The application of adaptive backstepping technique to 
the dc-bus voltage regulation and unity-power-factor control for a 
pulsewidth modulation  three-phase ac/dc boost converter is 
investigated. The controller design is based on a new model derived 
from power balancing between ac and dc sides. To compensate the 
nonlinearity in model and counteract uncertainty in load, the 
adaptive controller that achieves both voltage regulation and unity 
power factor is systematically derived by using feedback 
linearization and adaptive backstepping technique. The proposed 
approach provides direct regulation of dc-link voltage under large  
perturbation in load. Simulation results provide clear evidence on 
the voltage reference tracking performance under large 
perturbation in load. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In the past decade, three-phase pulsewidth modulation 
(PWM) ac/dc boost converters have been considered as useful 
elements for power-factor correction in many industrial 
applications [1]-[2], due to their attractive features such as high 
power factor, nearly sinusoidal input current and bidirectional 
power flow ability. 
In controlling the ac/dc converters, nonlinear methods [3]-[8] 
have recently received much attention in order to achieve 
global stability under large parameter variation and 
perturbation in load. In the work of [3], a Lyapunov-based 
scheme was proposed to synthesize a globally stable controller. 
As the controller realization requires knowledge of the 
equilibrium points at steady state, which depends on circuit 
parameters and load resistance, there may exist steady-state 
errors in the state variables. Vilathgamuwa et al. [4] adopt a 
two-time-scale approach to conduct sliding mode technique, in 
which dc-bus voltage dynamics are indirectly regulated 
through sliding modes. The input-output feedback linearization 
[5] and passivity-based controller [6]-[7] can not adjust the dc-
link voltage directly due to the inherent non-minimum property. 
Instead, a cascade (inner-outer loop) control structure is 
adopted to indirectly regulate the dc-link voltage with d-axis 
current. In these inner-outer loop schemes, the PI controller is 
commonly adopted for the voltage loop.  As integral action 
generally introduces lagging effects, the response time is 
usually long.   In contrast, a state feedback design via extended 
linearization is reported in [8] for achieving direct dc-bus 
voltage capability without using an inner-outer loop control 
structure. Although a fast tracking response is accomplished by 
this approach, the lack of integral action in controller makes 
the system suffer from the robustness issue and non-zero 
residual tracking error. In [9], the authors proposed a new 
model for three-phase PWM boost converters based on power 
balancing between ac and dc sides.  With a nonlinear transform 
on dc-bus voltage, a linear state feedback control design is 
applied to the linearized model. Since the load uncertainty 
appears as an unmatched term in the model, the robustness in 
load perturbation had not been considered. Also, in their work, 
the control variables are the control voltages that feed into the 
switching power devices rather than the switching functions. 
Hence the nonlinearities presented at the control variables are 
ignored. 
The backstepping control design [10] is a newly developed 
technique to synthesize nonlinear controller for systems with 
unmatched uncertainties. Many applications of this control 
methodology have been reported in industrial areas such as 
induction motors [11],  flight control [12] and dc-dc switching 
power converters [13]. 
Therefore, to achieve a direct regulation of dc-bus voltage 
with unity power factor, based on the model derived from 
power balancing [9], this study suggests use of the adaptive 
backstepping design approach for the controller design. The 
uncertainty in load is considered in the dc-bus voltage 
regulation. The effect of load disturbance is asymptotically 
eliminated via an online adaptive algorithm synthesized from 
the backstepping procedure. Simulation results with 
MATLAB/SIMULINK on a 1.5-kVA boost converter provide 
verification of the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

Thus the closed-loop system with the adaptive control laws 
(17)-(18), and (24)-(26) is stable.

define the following new function

From the definition of the Lyapunov function 0)( ≥tV  and 
(27), the integration satisfies

A direct application of the Barbalat’s Lemma [14] leads to  
      ∞→→ ttM  as  0)( . 
This shows that 21   , zz  and 3z  converge to zero as ∞→t . 
Hence, the goals of dc-bus voltage regulation and unity power 
factor has been achived despite the uncertainty in load. The 
overall control structure of the proposed adaptive backstepping 
for the boost converter is shown in Fig. 2. 
Since dix =2  and in view of (5), the error variable 2z  may 
be considered as an estimate of the difference of the supplied 
power on the ac side and the absorbed power on the dc side. 
Indeed, when the system is at steady state, 2z converges to zero.

persistent excitation [14]. 
 
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
   The functionality of the proposed controller is validated via 
computer simulation using ‘SimPowerSystems’ in 
MATLAB/SIMULINK. The specification and circuit 
parameters of the three-phase ac/dc boost converter are listed 
in Table 1. The parameter values of the proposed adaptive 
backstepping  controller are chosen as follows. 
810   , 50    ,  1 −===  ωζ n γ , 
2031 =k , 20002 =k , 000013 =k . 
The simulated responses for tracking step changes in voltage 
reference are shown in Fig. 3. Figure 4 displays the waveforms 
of the dc voltage, load current and d-q axis currents for a step 
change in dc load current from 2A to 5A and back to 2A with a 
fixed dc voltage reference set at 200V. The parameter 
adaptation in response to step change in load is shown in Fig. 5. 
The phase currents and a-phase voltage at ac side are plotted in 
Fig. 6. 
As compare these waveforms to the results of Lyapunov 
approach in [3] and extended linearization in [8], our approach 
can result in zero tracking error. Also, while subjecting to load 
disturbance, only a small dip (less than 5 volts) in dc-bus 
voltage is observed. This demonstrates that the proposed 
controller yields fast dynamic response and strong robustness. 
From the steady-state phase currents and voltage on the ac side 
shown in Fig. 6, it is observed that the power factor is almost 
unity and the source currents are nearly a sinusoidal wave. 
These results evidence the salient performance of the proposed 
design.

III. NONLINEAR ∞H  CONTROLLER DESIGN 
A. Problem Formulation 
 
In order to counteract the effect of parameter variations and 
load disturbance, a nonlinear ∞H  control scheme is proposed. 
To apply this method, the problem of voltage regulation with 
unity power factor must be formulated into an equivalent 
control framework shown in Fig. 2. In this configuration, for a 
chosen penalty variable w , the control objectives are 
expressed in terms of the following ∞H  performance ( 2L -gain) 
( )∫∫ +≤ TT βdtddtw 0 220 2 0γ  (4) 
where β  is a nonnegative function and γ  is a given positive 
number to specify the desired level of disturbance attenuation 
against the exogenous input d. Then, the ∞H  control problem 
is to find a state feedback controller such that the 2L -gain (4) 
constraint is satisfied and the closed-loop system is stable. 
As dc-side is loaded with a resistor having conductance LG , 
the goal is to regulate the output dc-bus voltage 3x  to a desired 
level rV  with unity power factor (i.e. )02 =x . At this operating 
point, the corresponding equilibrium point ) ,( * *px  may be 
calculated from (1)-(3). Indeed, by setting the right-hand sides

4 displays the nonlinear ∞H  controller structure and hardware 
configuration in the experiment. A personal computer (PC) 
equipped with data-acquisition boards was used to realize the 
control algorithm. The CPU of the PC is Pentium III running at 
a clock speed of 1GHz. For the controller, all measured signal 
inputs and control signal outputs are interfaced with PWM 
rectifier via 12-b multi-channel analog-to-digital (A/D) and 
digital-to-analog (D/A) converters whose conversion times are 
1μs and 5μs per channel, respectively. The sinusoidal PWM 
(SPWM) strategy is employed to generate the switching pattern. 
The control signals, cjv , , , , cbaj =  fed into the SPWM are 
transformed from switching functions  jp , j=a,b,c, through the 
following formula ([5], [14]) 
,jtricj pvv ×= . , , cbaj =      (25) 
where  cjv  stands for the amplitude of the triangular PWM 
carrier. The sampling period in this setup was 100µs and a 
simple zero-order Euler approximation was used to digitize the 
control law. The parameter values of the proposed nonlinear 
∞H  controller in (23)-(24) are chosen as .0501 =λ , 
.016021 =λk , 0.53 =λ  and 741 =λk .. 
The functionality of the proposed controller is first validated 
via computer simulation using ‘SimPowerSystems’ in 
MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulated results for tracking step 
changes in voltage reference (corresponding to VVr 30±=Δ  ) 
are shown in Fig. 5. Figure 6 displays the waveforms of the dc 
voltage, load current and d-q axis currents for a step change in 
dc load current from 1.8A to 4.5A with a fixed dc voltage 
reference set at 180V. Despite of a voltage drop about 30 volts 
is discovered during the transient, the dc voltage is regulated 
back to its desired level after 0.4 second, which evidences the 
effect of the integral action in the nonlinear controller. Note 
that the nonlinear ∞H  controller derived to meet the robustness 
constraint (4) can ensure closed-loop robust stability but not 
transient performance [15].  
Then, experiments were conducted to further verify the 
simulation results. For the set-point change in voltage 
reference from 120V to 180V and back to 120V, the responses 
of the dc voltage and d-q axis currents are depicted in Fig. 8. 
Figure 9 documents the responses of the dc voltage, load 
current and d-q axis currents for a step change in dc load 
current from 1.8A to 4.5A with a fixed dc voltage reference set 
at 180V. Good decoupling control performance between 
voltage loop and q-axis current loop is observed. As compare 
our results to the experimental results of Lyapunov approach in 
[3] and extended linearization in [8], the proposed approach 
can reduce the asymptotic tracking error to an almost invisible 
level due to the integral action. The steady-state phase currents 
and voltage on the ac side are shown in Fig. 10, which confirm 
that the power factor is almost unity and the source currents are 
nearly a sinusoidal wave. These results evidence the salient 
performance of the proposed design. Also from Figs. 5-10, 
there is a good agreement between the simulated results and 
experimental results, exhibiting the applicability of the 
proposed controller. 
V. CONCLUSION 
 This paper has presented a design and implementation of a 
robust controller derived according to the formulation of 
nonlinear  ∞H -control theory for a three-phase boost rectifier 
subject to step load change and parameter variations. The 
problem of dc-bus voltage regulation with unity-power-factor 
is formulated as an  ∞H -gain constraint on the augmented 
error dynamics. The control law is then derived from the 
solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi inequality. 
Generally, it is quite difficult to obtain a solution for a 
Hamilton-Jacobi inequality during nonlinear   controller 
synthesis. However, motivated from the case of dc-dc 
converters, and the connection between passivity and  ∞H -
gain, an energy storage function with suitable tuned parameters 
yields the desired result. As this storage function is also 
qualified as a Lyapunov function and radially unbounded, the 
closed-loop system is globally asymptotically stable. Simulated

III. CONTROLLER DESIGN 
A. Control Objective 
 
The objective in achieving both unity power factor and 
output dc voltage regulation can now be characterized as the 
two-fold: 3x   is regulated to zero (since qE   is zero under a 
balanced three phase supply) and  1x   tracks a given dc 
reference voltage 2dc, refv . From the control point of view, 
modeling the boost converter in the rotating d-q frame has the 
advantage of reducing the current control task (which 
sinusoidal tracking control is required) into a set-point tracking 
problem. However, one must note that the state equations (6)-
(8) are of nonlinear nature since the control inputs dp  and qp   
are multiplied by state variables. 
 
B. Adaptive Backstepping Controller Design 
 
In most case, the load resistance LR  remains unknown in 
advance. To achieve dc-bus voltage regulation and unity power 
factor under uncertainty in load, let θ  denote )2/( CRL in (6) to 
stand for the uncertain parameter due to unknown load. It can 
then be easily checked that this uncertain parameter does not 
satisfy the matching condition, which motivates the use of 
adaptive backstepping for controller design. The globally 
stable controller as well as the adaptive algorithm can be 
synthesized systematically step by step. 
Let the dc-bus voltage command is generated from the  
following reference model

10&  (9) 
with 2dc, refvr =  and Trrr xxx ]  [ 21= .  
Now, we can proceed deriving the adaptive controller via 
backstepping and Lyapunov argument. Define the error 
variables  
     111 rxxz −= , αxECz m −= 22
3  and 33 xz =  (10) 
where α  is a virtual stabilizing control for 1z . As 2z converges 
to zero, the dynamic euation of 1z  may be stabilized by the 
virtual control α . Another rationale behind the choice of the 
variable 2z  in (10) will be explained later. 
Since θ  is unknown, we introduce a variable θˆ  to estimate 
the uncertainty parameter θ and design the virtual control to be 
      1111 )(ˆ rxzθzkα &+−−= φ ,   01 >k  (11) 
where 1111 )()( xxzz r −=+−=φ . Taking the time derivative of

Abstract-Switch-mode rectifiers have been proved as effective 
devices to supply steady dc power with improved power quality at ac 
mains. In this paper, we present a new control scheme, developed 
under the formulation of nonlinear  theory, for three-phase 
pulsewidth modulation boost rectifiers to achieve unity-power-factor 
and dc-link voltage regulation with guaranteed robust performance. 
The closed-loop system is also shown to be Lyapunov stable. The 
proposed approach provides direct regulation of dc-link voltage with 
strong robustness against large parameter variations and 
perturbation in load. The validity of the proposed nonlinear   
controller is verified by means of computer simulation and 
experimental analysis. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The rapid proliferation of nonlinear loads in power systems, 
such as power supplies for consumer electronics, battery 
charging and dc motor drives, has incurred harmonic-related 
and reactive power problems. In the past decade, three-phase 
pulsewidth modulation (PWM) boost rectifiers (ac/dc 
converters) have been considered as useful elements for power-
factor correction in many industrial applications [1]-[2], due to 
their attractive features such as high power factor, nearly 
sinusoidal input current and bidirectional power flow ability. 
The aim to achieve high-performance control for PWM 
boost rectifiers has intrigued adoptation of advanced nonlinear 
controllers [3]-[8] for satisfying requirements both fast 
regulation and global stability. In the work of [3], a Lyapunov-
based scheme was proposed to synthesize a globally stable 
controller. As the controller realization requires knowledge of 
the equilibrium points at steady state, which depends on circuit 
parameters and load resistance, there may exist steady-state 
errors in the state variables. Vilathgamuwa et al. [4] adopt a 
two-time-scale approach to conduct sliding mode technique, in 
which dc-bus voltage dynamics are indirectly regulated 
through sliding modes. The research of Lee [5] on the 
geometric properties of the rectifiers revealed that with the 
choice of output variables as dc-link voltage and d-axis current, 
the boost rectifier becomes a non-minimum phase system to 
which many nonlinear inversion-based approaches are not 
applied. To avoid this situation, output variables are chosen to 
be d and q axis currents and an inner-outer loop control 
structure is adopted to indirectly regulate dc-bus dynamics [5]-
[7]. In contrast, a state feedback design via extended 
linearization is reported in [8] for achieving direct dc-bus 
voltage capability without using an inner-outer loop control 
structure. Although a fast tracking response is accomplished by 
this approach, the lack of integral action in controller makes 
the system suffer from the robustness issue and non-zero 
residual tracking error. 
The ∞H   control methodology has long been recognized as a 
powerful tool for designing robust controller in counteracting 
external disturbances and model uncertainties. More 
importantly, it is also applicable to non-minimum phase system 
and the desired robustness requirement may be incorporated in 
the controller design. This approach mainly relies on 
formulating the control objectives in terms of the ∞H -gain 
( 2L -gain) [9] constraint on a so called generalized plant. Some 
applications of this control methodology have been reported in 
various industrial areas such as induction motors [10], power 
systems [11], robot arms [12] and switching power converters 
[13].  
This paper presents the design of a nonlinear ∞H   controller 
for three-phase PWM boost rectifiers to achieve dc-bus voltage 
regulation with unity power factor. The desired robust 
performances such as insensitivity to load disturbance and 
circuit parameters are also prescribed via a ∞H -gain constraint 
on the generalized plant. Motivated from the passivity results 
for the ac/dc converters [6] and the work of Kugi and 
Schlacher [13] for the Cuk converters, the solution of the 
corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi inequality (HJI) can be found 
by considering the energy storage function candidate. Since the 
solution is also qualified to be a Lyapunov function, the 
stability of the closed loop is established along the standard 
Lyapunov criterion [9]. As in [13], an integral-error term is 
incorporated to enhance robustness under uncertainties and 
reduce the stationary tracking error to a small desired level. 
Simulated and experimental results on a 1.5-kVA laboratory 
prototype provide verification of the effectiveness of the 
proposed controller.

Now, subjecting to the generalized error equation (12), the 
objective is to find a state feedback law, )(zαv = , so that the 
closed-loop system is stable and the ∞H  performance (4) is 
satisfied for a given positive number γ . The block diagram of 
the ∞H  control formulation for the three-phase ac/dc boost 
rectifier is shown in Fig. 3. 
B. ∞H  Controller Synthesis 
 
Since the generalized plant (12) is of nonlinear nature, the 
synthesis of the ∞H  controller must be undertaken in the 
nonlinear framework. For a given positive number γ , the 
results in [9] reveal that the nonlinear ∞H  controller may be 
constructed via the solution V of the HJI

renders the closed-loop system fulfill the desired ∞H  
performance (4) with asymptotic stability. Solving the HJI is 
often intractable. However, from nonlinear ∞H  control 
literature, the solution of the HJI are usually related to the 
energy dissipative function. In other words, the energy storage 
function may be considered as a candidate to solve the HJI. 
Motivated from the passivity results [6]-[7], we consider the  
following positive definite function

the HJI  (13) is fulfilled. Thus, we have shown that the state 
feedback law (16)-(17) with parameters satisfied the 
constraints (19)-(22) achieves the ∞H  performance (4). 
Since the energy storage function (15) is positive definite, 
following the same argument in [9], we can show that )(zV  is 
a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system (12) with 
feedback law (16)-(17). That is, when d=0, the time derivative 
of V along the closed-loop system (12) is negative semidefinite. 
Then, by applying LaSalle’s invariance principle [9], we can 
deduce that the penalty variables 2z  and 3z  asymptotically 
approach to zero as ∞→t .  
For realizing the resulting ∞H  controller, the control law 
derived above is rewritten as
