2algorithm to combine both single voxel and 2D SI MRS data using phased array coils in time 
domain.  He concluded that his method allowed MRS data can be processed as efficient as those 
acquired with non-phased array coils and differences in coil sensitivity, coil proximity, and relative 
phase between coils can be compensated for prior to combination in the time domain [2].  On the 
other hand, frequency-domain fitting using LCModel [7] for MRS data from phased array coils has 
become more popular due to its automatic analysis and capability of absolute quantification. 
Mostly LCModel was applied to analyze individual spectra from each coil element, and the 
weighted sum spectrum is constructed from the individual analyzed spectra and the amplitude or 
SNR of a particular resonance in each spectrum.  Some problems of combining MRS data [8] need 
to be discussed.  One is to find the appropriate reference in order to weight the individual datasets 
acquired from each coil. Using the residual water peak poses some difficulties because the water 
resonance may have varying line shapes and phases from coil-to-coil due to the suppression 
method.  Basing the reference on a single metabolite in all the datasets may not be optimal since its 
concentration may vary spatially  [8].  As a result, an automatic algorithm that combines the 
complex spectral data becomes necessary in order to provide the possibility and flexibility  in further 
analysis and absolute quantification.
4、 研究方法
All studies were conducted at 1.5T system (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI).  Four healthy 
subjects (all males, age: 23 y/o) were included in this study. Localized single voxel MRS 
measurements were performed at temporal lobe using a PRESS sequence (TR/TE = 1600/35 ms, 
Ave =128, voxel size= 20x20x20mm3) with quadrature head coil and an 8-channel receive-only 
phased array  head coil respectively (Fig.1). Routine 3D T1 protocol was performed for voxel 
localization of MRS to ensure the identical voxel positioning for different coils (Fig.2(a)).  With 
phased array coil, both the raw data combined by phased array coil manufactory and the raw data of 
each individual channel were acquired by two different modes: Spectro-Mode and Array-Mode 
respectively.
Spectra acquired from quadrature coil were analyzed by LCModel [7] with predefined factor 
of calibration for absolute concentrations.  In the meanwhile, the spectra of each coil element 
acquired by phased array coils were underwent eddy  current correction (ECC) according to [9] 
before being combined with weighting factors.  Those weighting factors were determined by: 
                           
where Anws,i refers to the maximum absolute value of time-domain signal without water suppression. 
The corrected, combined spectra were then analyzed by  LCModel for water scaling procedure.   On 
the other hand, those uncorrected, uncombined spectra were analyzed using water scaling with eddy 
current correction provided by LCModel.  The accuracy of absolute concentrations was evaluated 
by:  
                  Error = {[M]-[M]fcal} / [M]fcal  x 100%  
where [M]fcal is the absolute concentration quantitated by factor of calibration.  SNR provided by 
LCModel, which is defined as the ratio of the maximum in the spectrum-minus-baseline over the 
analysis window to twice the RMS residuals, was used as an index of the quality  for fitting as well 
as quantification.
