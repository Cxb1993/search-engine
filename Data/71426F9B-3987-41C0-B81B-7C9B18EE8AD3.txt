三、 研究方法及成果 of computations [2]. On the other hand, the 
subspace-based algorithms, most notably the multiple 
signal classification (MUSIC) [3] and the ESPRIT [4], 
strike a good balance between the estimation accuracy 
and complexity with limited snapshots. For example, 
Li et al. [5] addressed an efficient ESPRIT-based 
algorithm for joint angle and polarization estimation 
with a COLD array. Hua [6] proposed a 
pencil-MUSIC for the 2-D angle and polarization 
estimation. However, despite its effectiveness, [6] 
stacked the received data to simultaneously estimate 
the parameters and thus called for high computational 
overhead due to taking the eigendecomposition of a 
large matrix. Furthermore, [5], [6] required an extra 
pairing process. To eliminate the cumbersome pairing 
process, [7] considered an ESPRIT-based algorithm 
for the estimation of the 2-D angles and polarization. 
The computations required by [7], however, are still 
high and it, additionally, requires more dipoles and 
loops of arrays to achieve this. 
Data Model 
Consider a uniform rectangular array (URA) with M × 
N crossed dipoles spaced Δx and Δy in the x-axis and 
y-axis, respectively. Assume that there are K 
uncorrelated narrowband transverse electromagnetic 
(TEM) wave sources with the center frequency fc and 
amplitudes {sk(t)}. Note that the polarization of a TEM 
wave is often specified by two real 
parameters, (0 / 2)i iγ γ π≤ ≤  and ( )i iη π η π− ≤ ≤

where E is the antenna sensitivity, which is an 
arbitrary (nonzero) complex constant, iφ  and iθ , are 
elevation and azimuth angles of the ith incoming signal, 
respectively. 
At time instant t, the signal observed at the output 
of the crossed dipole at the (m, n) antenna element can 
be expressed as [6] 
In order to enhance the estimation accuracy with 
low hardware or computational overhead, this project 
proposes a low complexity tree-structured 1-D 
ESPRIT-based algorithm to jointly estimate the 2-D 
angles and polarization of the signals arriving at an 
antenna array with crossed dipoles. The proposed 
algorithm estimates the 2-D angles and polarization 
alternatively in a hierarchical tree structure. The 
intrinsic data structure is fully exploited and the data 
are ingeniously stacked so that only a sequence of the 
1-D ESPRIT algorithms are required. In addition, 
spatial beamforming processes are invoked in between 
the 1-D ESPRIT algorithms to progressively partition 
the signals into finer groups to enhance the estimation 
accuracy and to mitigate the contaminated noise. With 
such an ingenious tree-structured estimation scheme, 
the pairing of these parameters is automatically 
achieved without extra hardware or computational cost. 
Simulation results show that compared with previous 
works the new algorithm provides satisfactory 
performance but substantially reduced computations, 
as it only involves the 1-D ESPRIT algorithms.

PROPOSED FAST ALGORITHM： 
In this section, we develop an efficient 1-D 
ESPRIT-based algorithm for joint estimation of the 
2-D angles and polarization. The proposed algorithm 
begins with the estimation of the 2-D angles followed 
by the polarization. To estimate the x-axis angles of 
the incoming signals, we first construct X(t) by 
stacking xmn(t) as

After the above 2-D angle estimation, we move 
on to estimate the polarization. To achieve this, we 
partition Yi,j(t) into 2 N ×M sub-block matrices and 
then stack them as , ,, , , ,( ) ( ) ( ) ( )tP N i

possesses only one signal.

estimations of the 2-D DOAs and polarizations in 
existing literature, the proposed algorithms possess the 
following attractive attributes: (1) it only employs the 
1-D ESPRIT to estimate these fours parameters, so the 
computation complexity is substantially reduced; (2) 
the pairing of parameters is automatically reached 
without extra complexity; (3) With the ingenious 
incorporation of the spatial beamforming processes, 
the noise power is reduced which results in enhanced  
estimation accuracy. Simulation results are also 
furnished to justify the proposed approach. This 
research result has been submitted to Signal 
Processing and is currently under the review process. 
Right now, we are working on the extension of this 
HSTD technique to other similar signal processing or 
communication problems
