1. 研究計畫之背景及目的
In the past decades, there were many efforts from research groups and companies to push many
novel display technologies with ever improving image qualities to fulfil the needs of the even criticizing
human eyes. Brighter image, higher contrast ratio, higher resolution, greater uniformity and
chromaticity, larger area and thinner depth are all in the list of needs. With the progresses of micro-
fabrication and nano-fabrication technologies, micro-optical and nano-optical components are used to
improve the image qualities mentioned above. The examples are the brightness enhancement film (BEF,
produced by 3M company), which is a micro-prism film, and the dual brightness enhancement film
(DBEF, produced by 3M company), which is a multiple-microlayer film, used in the back-light module
of LCD. The rear-projection screen, which is composed of a Fresnel lens and a lenticular lens used for
image uniformity and viewing angle controlling, is another example of large area micro-optical
components with the feature size of several tens to several hundred micrometers [1-9]. Pixelated
OLEDs with shaped substrates with micro-refractive structures, like arrays of micro-lenses or pyramids
or scattering layers, aligned on individual OLED pixels (see the figure below) give an increase in
extraction efficiency relative to the unstructured substrate by a factor 2-3 [10-12]. The effect of micro-
lens or pyramid arrays attached to the substrate/air interface for unpixelated OLEDs has been

of the micro-optical components and the pixelated display. Find the design rule to minimize these
artifacts and the “clever” design method for fabricating the micro-optical elements. Make a prototype
micro-optics-assisted display to verify the optimization design to achieve high efficiency and low
artifacts.
2. 研究方法
In this project, we shall evaluate the Morie pattern and optimize the image quality of the display
system using arrays of micro-optical components. Optical simulation is used to estimate and optimize
the performances of optical components and display system before fabrication. Measurements are used
to get parameters for optical simulation and check the results for fabrication. However some of the
optical simulation and measurement methods need to be developed and can be regarded as the

(3) We will study the “clever” design method for avoiding the Morie pattern. This will depend on the
specific example we would like to deal with and the functionality of the micro-optical components
will be. The experimental part of measuring the speckle pattern will be done by using a pixelated
display with a micro-lens array on it, taking high resolution images of the composite system and
making analysis of the images. The “optimized” design will be the one with the highest light
efficiency and the least Morie effect, which will be defined by the least contrast of the Morie
pattern.

(1) A systematic approach for studying the light extraction efficiency enhancement on organic light-
emitting device by microlens array attachment: [26][28], The area ratio and the height ratio are the
dominant factor in determining the light extraction enhancement of OLED’s.
(2) Luminance enhancement and blur effect of microlens array film attachment on organic light emitting
devices [29], the definition of blur width is firstly defined in this paper.
(3) White Light Generation from a Blue OLED Pumped MEH-PPV Thin-Film with microlens array
film [29]

moiré pattern such that while the angular misalignment becomes larger, the moiré fringes increase
and their sizes reduce.
(7) The simulation for the OLED display with innovative hollow microlens array attachment [31]. For
suppressing the moiré phenomenon, we propose two different arrangements of hollow microlens
array attachments on the pixelated OLED array. From the simulation results, we conclude that the
suppression of the moiré phenomenon depends on the difference of the pitches of the two arrays and
the number of the microlenses in one period.

system and the relationship between the micro-optical components and the system. This will be very
helpful to be used as the analysis tool for further research and industrial utilization.
(2) Build up an artifact-free or least-artifact display system. For academic interest, this prototype can be
used to verify the optical model. For industrial interest, this prototype can be used to be a feasible
study of miniaturized display products.
Based on the results in this project, we are preparing the patent filing and paper submitting
procedure. There are expected to be at least one fundamental patent and two international journal papers
of high impact factor.
