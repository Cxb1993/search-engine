Abstract—A compact strip dipole coupled folded resonator 
antenna is proposed for radio-frequency identification (RFID) 
tag applications. The strip dipole can be fed by a coplanar strip 
line or attached directly to an RFID chip. A prototype antenna 
is designed and fabricated, and is tested using thru-reflect-line 
(TRL) calibration technique and/or probe measurement tech-
nique in the anechoic chamber. The input impedances and the 
radiation patterns are measured and compared to the simulated 
ones. Good agreement between simulation and experiment is 
obtained. The prototype antenna is designed at 915MHz and 
conjugate matched to the chip impedance ZC = 33 - j112 Ω of the 
TI RFID tag. The measured input impedance of the antenna is 
ZA = 39 + j89 Ω, and the simulated in-band maximal antenna 
gain is 0.48 dBi.

I. INTRODUCTION 
adio frequency identification (RFID) is a special appli-
cation in automatic identification procedures (Auto-ID). 
The technology has been applied to many applications, such 
as tracking library books, corporate campuses, automatic 
parking, managing traffic, airport dispensing goods, supply 
chain management, and etc. [1]. Several frequency bands 
have been assigned to RFID applications, such as 125 kHz, 
13.56 MHz, 433 MHz, 850–960 MHz, 2.45GHz, and 5.8 
GHz. As the operating frequency for RFID systems rises into 
the ultra-high frequency (UHF) and microwave region, the 
antenna of tag has some different practical challenges: cost, 
size, polarization, getting along with the neighbors, and 
matching the IC load [2]. The basic passive RFID system is 
shown in Fig. 1. Tags can be powered by rectifying the radio 
signal sent by the readers, and send data back to the reader by 
changing the loading of the tag antenna in a coded manner, or 
by generating, modeling, and transmitting a radio signal. The 
tag antenna must be carefully designed to match the free 
space and to the following application-specific integrated 
circuit (ASIC) [3], maximizing the power transfer of the 
RFID system. It is especially important in a passive RFID 
system in which power of the ASIC is supported by the 
incoming radio wave. Kurokawa [4] proposed a concept of 
power waves travelling between the generator and the 
complex load impedance, but no lossless transmission line is 
present between them. The method can also be applied to 
analyze the antenna and the chip load. The equivalent circuit 
 
 
of an RFID tag is shown in Fig. 2, where ZA = RA + jXA is the 
antenna impedance, ZC = RC + jXC is the chip input 
impedance, and VA is the electrical field developed as a 
voltage at the terminals of the antenna [5]. The power wave 
reflection coefficient s is

and the perfect complex conjugate match is ZC = ZA*. 
Although the equivalence circuit is valid for minimum 
scattering tag antenna structures [6], it can still be effectively 
applied to several antenna and measurement problems [7]-[9]. 
In addition to the requirements of input impedance match and 
radiation performance, the conformal structure and the 
compact size are the main concerns in the design process. 
There have been various structures proposed for different 
applications of RFID tag antennas. To miniaturize the 
structure of the tag antenna, the GA-optimized self-resonant 
meander-line antennas [10] and antennas of folded structure 
have been designed [11]-[14]. For the sensing system, the 
antenna in [15] is proposed and implemented in a paper-base.

the desired chip impedance within the 902-928 MHz band, 
the design parameters are: L = 36.5 mm, d = 4.5 mm, C = 1.5 
mm, 
B = 2.0 mm, and M = 33.5 mm. Fig. 6 shows the simulated 
antenna impedances with various M. When the parameter M 
is reduced, the antenna input reactance is decreased but the 
input resistance is almost unchanged within the 902-928 
MHz band. Ansoft HSFF v11.1 is adopted as the simulation 
tool throughout the design process. TRL calibration method 
and the probe measurement technique are used to verify the 
antenna input impedance (parts A and B below), and the 
radiation patterns are measured in the anechoic chamber 
(parts C and D below). 
A. TRL Calibration 
While designing the feeding structure, the simulation, chip 
connection, and the measurement must be considered 
simultaneously. The strap connected to RFID chip is shown 
in Fig. 7. Obviously, the mismatch is tremendous between the 
chip input impedance of the prototype antenna and the 50-Ω 
system impedance of the network analyzer. It is thus difficult 
to accurately measure the input impedance of the antenna 
with the reference plane placed on the structure. To measure 
the antenna input impedance at 915MHz, a simple method to 
compare the simulation results is TRL calibration [26], which 
is intended to measure the S-parameters of a two-port device 
at the indicated reference planes [26]. In this design, it sets 
the one-port device reference plane as shown in Fig. 8. Since 
the pad spacing of chip is almost 0.3 mm [25], a suitable 
method for the measurement is by using a coplanar stripline 
(CPS) as an instrument. However, several points should be 
noted: 
1. The size of the slot of CPS, g, should be chosen in 
accordance with the pads distance of the chip. In other 
words, while changing the pads distance, g must be 
adjusted accordingly. 
2. The width of the strip of CPS, W2, must be carefully 
chosen to weld SMA connector and reduce the effects 
due to the discontinuity. 
3. To reduce the impact of the antenna by CPS, W1 should 
be as small as possible. Therefore, we use the Technical 
Data Sheet in [25] and [29] as the reference values. 
 To satisfy the requirements mentioned above, a taper CPS 
is adopted to connect the antenna and the SMA connector. 
The parameters are: W1 =1.1 mm, W2 = 2.0 mm, L1 =5.0 mm, 
L2 = 5.0 mm, R=20 mm, and g=0.3 mm. From [30] and [31] 
and by MATLAB calculations, the CPS characteristic 
impedances are found to be 98.4Ω and 91.2Ω at W1/L1 and 
W2/L2, respectively. Similarly, 1/4 guided wave length, LC, is 
50.6 mm. The "Line" in TRL calibration structure is shown in 
Fig. 9. To make the antenna conjugate match to the desired 
chip impedance, the simulated and measured antenna input 
resistance and reactance are plotted in Figs. 10(a) and (b), 
respectively. The measured input impedance is 47 + j74 at 
915MHz.

limits. The reflected serial number signal of the RFID tag is 
detected by the reader at two different distances, 0.5 and 1 m, 
with transmitted power in the range of 15 to 26 dBm [40]. 
The minimum transmitted power that produces detectable 
signals at the reader are measured for various RFID tag 
E-plane orientations, as shown in Table I. Note that the 
minimum and maximum powers occur at θ = 180° and θ = ± 
90°, respectively, in a good accordance with the simulated 
and measured results. The tag and reader antennas are placed 
on Styrofoam to reduce the effect of the sponge box. The 
measurement environment is shown in Fig. 16. 
 According to the measurement guidelines discussed above, 
the environment parameters are shown in Fig 17, where T = 
0.61 m and H = 1.37 m. Rd = 0.5 m and 1.0 m for ψ = 20° and 
36°, respectively. The pyramidal absorbers are used to reduce 
the forward scattering while providing good back scattering 
property. This ensures that it is suitable for use in all locations 
within the anechoic chamber. At either distances of Rd, the 
incidence reflectivity is less than -40dB [41], [42]. 
 The gain of the tag antenna is not directly measureable. 
This is due to the unknown power consumption in the process 
of receiving and re-sending of signals by the tag, and the 
unknown mismatch between the Strap by heat curing epoxy 
and the PCB board. To activate the tag, the minimum 
transmitted power is -13 dBm [22]. 
IV. 2.45GHZ TAG ANTENNA DESIGN  
 A 2.45 GHz RFID application is designed through the 
process described above. The input impedance of the tag 
antenna is taken to be 50 ohms. A photograph of the antenna 
with SMA connector and “Thru” Line is shown in Fig. 18. It 
is designed and fabricated on an FR-4 substrate with 
dielectric constant εr = 4.4, loss tangent tan δ = 0.02, and 
thickness h = 0.4 mm. The design parameters are: L = 13 mm, 
d = 3 mm, g = 4 mm, B = 1.2 mm, M = 3 mm, C = 5 mm, a = 
3 mm, and G = 0.3 mm. The simulated and measured input 
reflection coefficients by TRL calibration of the prototype 
antenna are shown in Fig. 19. The simulated E- and H-plane 
crosspolarization levels are less than -38 and -39 dB, 
respectively. The peak antenna gain simulated at 2.45 GHz is 
2.56 dBi. 
V. CONCLUSION 
A strip dipole coupled folded resonator antenna proposed 
for UHF RFID tag application has been presented. The 
antenna structure is uniplanar, simple, and compact in size 
with an area of merely 73.0 x 15.5 mm2. The power reflection 
coefficient method proposed by Kurokawa, in which the 
antenna and chip with complex impedances are directly 
connected, has been applied to the design. To accomplish the 
conjugate matching, the antenna structure is adjusted so that 
the input reactance of the antenna approaches the negative

Abstract—A slot dipole antenna capacitively fed by a coplanar 
waveguide (CPW) miniaturized by a pair of compact split-ring 
resonators (SRRs) is proposed. It is demonstrated that, with a 
fixed slot length, the resonant frequency of the slot can be 
lowered significantly when the SRRs are placed close to the 
central feeding CPW line. In other words, the slot length can be 
reduced significantly for a fixed resonant frequency. A prototype 
antenna is fabricated and tested to verify the proposed design. 
Keywords- Coplanar waveguides (CPWs), split-ring resonators 
(SRRs), slot antennas. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Slot dipole antennas fed by coplanar waveguides (CPWs) 
have many advantages, such as low dispersion, uniplanar 
structure, and ease of integration with RF front-end circuitry. 
CPW-fed slot dipole antennas have been proposed for many 
different applications [1]-[4]. These antennas are simple in 
structure and possess low cross-polarized radiation levels with 
only one metallization layer. However, they occupy a large 
portion of antenna size due to their inductive feeding structure. 
The capacitive type of feeding is able to reduce half of the 
antenna size as compared to the inductive type of feeding, 
since the boundary condition at the feeding point is open-
circuited instead of short-circuited. However, only a few 
works have used the capacitive type of feeding [5]-[7]. Using 
high dielectric constant substrates can also miniaturize the 
antenna size, but at the expense of degrading the antenna 
performance. Another method for reducing the antenna size is 
to change the boundary condition of the antenna. For example, 
using a shorting pin on a patch [8], replacing the two short 
circuits at the end of the resonant slot by inductive or 
capacitive loadings [9], or using the lump elements with 
periodical arrangement [10]. 
In this paper, we propose a miniaturizing approach using 
a pair of compact split-ring resonators (SRRs) to modify the 
boundary condition of the slot dipole antenna. In general, 
SRRs are used to form the left-handed transmission line 
characteristics [11]-[14]. By placing the SRRs symmetrically 
on two sides of the slot and adjusting the distance between the 
SRR and the feeding point, the resonant frequency of the slot 
can be changed. The shorter the distance is, the lower the slot 
resonant frequency will be. Moreover, the antenna perfor-
mance such as broadside and bi-directional radiation patterns, 
and low cross-polarized radiation levels are retained. 
II. ANTENNA STRUCTURE 
The geometry of the proposed antenna is shown in Fig. 1. 
The dark gray, light gray, and white areas represent the upper 
plane with SRRs, lower plane with slot dipole and the ground, 
and the dielectric substrate in between the two planes, 
respectively. The slot dipole in the lower plane has dimensions 
(2L2+2G+S) x t. A pair of SRRs on the upper plane is placed 
symmetrically above the slot. The length L2 is chosen 
corresponding to a half guided-wavelength at the fundamental 
resonant frequency. Owing to this feeding structure, the 
boundary condition at the feed point is always open-circuited. 
Therefore, the fundamental frequencies are very difficult to 
excite. We need to adjust the extended feeding gap, c, such 
that the antenna has better input match. The unit cell of the 
SRR consists of three concentric square metallic split rings as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). When excited by a time-varying external 
magnetic field directed along the x-axis, its equivalent circuit 
can be drawn as that shown in Fig. 2(b) [13], [15], where L0 
and C0 are the self- inductance and self-capacitance of the 
equivalent circuit of the SRR, respectively, and LS and CS are

of the connecting cable. The measured and simulated H-plane 
patterns are almost omni-directional, and dipole radiation 
patterns are retained. The peak antenna gain measured at 2.50 
GHz is 4.7 dBi.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
Miniaturization of a capacitive CPW-fed slot dipole 
antenna with SRRs loaded has been presented. By placing a 
pair of SRRs symmetrically above the slot dipole and close to 
the feeding CPW line, a significant reduction in the slot length 
can be achieved. Moreover, simulation and measurement 
results showed that the proposed antenna can be tuned to have 
good impedance match and the dipole radiation patterns can 
still be retained. With reduced size and good antenna 
performance, the proposed antenna is very suitable in many 
wireless applications.

named as S1. The input match of the proposed antenna would 
be better if the ground margin S1 is large enough. Therefore, 
we fixed S1 at 10 mm in all measurements and simulations. 
The height of the upper plate as well as the profile of this 
antenna, named as h, has insignificant effect on the impedance 
bandwidth. Due to the folded up structure and the presence of 
the six via holes, the proposed antenna possesses a four-band 
operation including the original two dual-band slot dipole 
resonant modes. The lower and the upper resonant paths of the 
dual-band slot dipole modes are L1 + L2 + h + L4 + L5 and L1 +
h + L3, respectively, which correspond to about a quarter 
guided-wavelength at 900 and 1900 MHz, respectively. The 
spacing between V1L and V1R as well as V3L, and V3R
corresponds to about a half guided-wavelength at 2.6 GHz, 
since these via holes introduce the short-circuit boundary 
condition at this frequency. Moreover, the length of the slot L4
+ W1 + W4 corresponds to a half guide-wavelength at 6 GHz. 
III. SIMULATED AND MEASURED RESULT
A prototype of the proposed antenna is fabricated and tested. 
The widths of the strip and gap of the 50- CPW feed line, S
and G, are determined to be 3.0 and 0.3 mm, respectively. The 
parameters of the prototype antenna are: L = 10 mm, L1 = 16 
mm, L2 = 24 mm, L3 = 19 mm, L4 = 10.5 mm, L5 = 24 mm, W
= 11 mm, W1 = 3 mm, W2 = 25 mm, W3 = 3 mm, W4 = 0.5 mm, 
W5 = 2 mm, S1 = 10 mm, S2 = 5 mm, h = 1.6 mm, h1 = 0.8 mm 
and h2 = 0.6 mm. The radius of all  via holes are 0.5 mm. The 
measured and simulated input reflection coefficients are 
shown in  Fig.  3.  The  impedance  bandwidths  (VSWR ≤ 3)  of  
the measured results are 0.88-1.06 GHz, 1.48-2.66 GHz, 3.54-
4.11 GHz, and 4.99-8.52 GHz which can cover the 
GSM900/1800/1900/GPS/WCDMA/WLAN 2.4 and 5 GHz 
bands. All simulated results are obtained by using the 
simulator Ansoft HFSS 10.0. The measured peak antenna gains 
versus the frequency are shown in Fig. 4. The peak antenna 
gains over the GSM900 band, GPS to 2.4 GHz WLAN bands, 
and 5 GHz WLAN bands range from 0.0 to 1.7 dBi, 2.2 to 3.0 
dBi, and 3.0 to 4.0 dBi, respectively. The measured radiation 
patterns  at  0.98,  2.0,  and  6  GHz  are  plotted  in  Fig.  5.  It  is  
observed that their x-y plane (horizontal) patterns are omni-
directional, which are desirable for mobile communication. 
IV. CONCLUSION
A CPW-fed folded slot dipole antenna for mobile handset 
applications has been proposed. By folding the uniplanar dual- 
band slot dipole antenna over to the other metal plane and

Besides the mentioned design principles, to further enhance 
the directivity towards the end-fire direction and raise the 
front-to-back ratio (F/B) at the same time without occupying 
additional areas, not only the bottom metal layer but also the 
top metal one is elaborately designed to be a concave 
parabolic reflector whose shapes are identical. Moreover, 
some vias connecting the top and bottom metal layers are 
employed to reinforce the reflection ability of the backward 
radiation to the forward direction; in other words, vias can 
again upgrade the directivity and enhance the front-to-back 
ratio due to the metal nature.  
Furthermore, although the director used in this design is 
only a single-stage one, it is carefully and innovatively 
designed to enhance the dragging ability for the radiation 
pattern. This single stage director is composed of the metal 
strip on the top metal layer, a metal strip on the bottom layer, 
and one metal via connecting the said two metal strips. The 
layers of the two described strips are respectively 
corresponding to the ones of the two arms of the meandered 
driven dipole so that the dragging force for the radiation 
pattern can be improved again due to no cross-layer gaps 
existing between the director and arms of the driven dipole.  
III. DESIGN AND SIMULATION RESULTS 
In Fig. 2, the white part is the FR4 dielectric substrate, the 
gray areas represent the top metal layer, and the dark ones 
stand for the bottom metal layer. The curves on top-layer and 
bottom-layer are designed with exactly the same concave 
parabolic shape, and the meandered driven dipole is located 
around the focus of the parabolic reflector. The distance 
between the focus and the apex of the concave parabolic 
reflector is designed to be around 0.25 guided wavelength to 
lead to better reflection ability from the parabolic reflector. 
The dielectric substrate used is the FR4 with the relative 
dielectric constant of 4.4, loss tangent of 0.02, and substrate 
thickness of 0.8 mm. The conductivity of the metal is 5.8×10
7
 
S/m, the radius of the metal via is 0.4 mm, and the target 
operation frequency is the GPS frequency, i.e., 1575 MHz. All 
dimensions of the proposed antenna shown in Fig. 2 are 
designed and listed in Table I.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
The miniaturization of the previously proposed planar high-
directivity Yagi-Uda antenna with a concave parabolic 
reflector [10] based on the meandered line technique has been 
implemented and demonstrated. 78% of reduction in the 
antenna size is obtained with the sacrifice of only 1.7 dB in 
the antenna directivity. Further meandering of the driven 
dipole can reduce the total antenna size more, but the 
efficiency and the directivity may become tradeoffs.
