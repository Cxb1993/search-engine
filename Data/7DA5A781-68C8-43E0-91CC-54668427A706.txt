1. Introduction 
 
This paper proposes a cost reduction distribution policy to improve the economic lot size 
solution of a manufacturing system with discontinuous issuing policy and imperfect 
rework [1]. In manufacturing sector, the economic production quantity (EPQ) model is 
commonly used to assist producers in determining the optimal production lot size that 
minimizes overall production-inventory costs [2-4]. EPQ model implicitly assumes that 
items produced are of perfect quality. But in real-life production systems, due to process 
deterioration or other factors, generation of defective items is inevitable. Hence, many 
studies have been carried out to enhance EPQ model by addressing the imperfect 
production issue [5-14]. Rosenblatt and Lee [11] proposed an EPQ model that deals with 
imperfect quality. They assumed that at some random point in time the process might 
shift from an in-control to an out-of-control state, and a fixed percentage of defective 
items are produced. Approximate solutions for obtaining an optimal lot size were 
developed. Zhang and Gerchak [14] considered joint lot sizing and inspection policy in 
an EOQ model with random yield. Defective items sometimes can be reworked and 
repaired, and hence overall production costs can be significantly reduced [15-21]. 
Examples for such production processes may include printed circuit board assembly, or 
plastic injection molding, etc., sometimes employs rework as an acceptable process in 
terms of level of quality. Chiu et al. [17] studied the optimal replenishment policy for 
manufacturing systems with failure in rework, backlogging, and random breakdown. 
Grosfeld-Nir and Gerchak [18] considered multistage production systems where 
defective units can be reworked repeatedly at every stage. They showed that a multistage 
system where only one of the stages requires a set-up can be reduced to a single-stage 
system, and proved that it is best to make the "bottle-neck" the first stage of the system. 
They also developed recursive algorithms for solving two- and three-stage systems.  
Another unrealistic assumption of classic EPQ model is the continuous inventory 
issuing policy for satisfying product demand. In real-life vendor-buyer integrated 
production- inventory system, multiple or periodic deliveries of finished products are 
commonly used. Schwarz [22] examined a one-warehouse N-retailer deterministic 
inventory system. The objective was to determine the stocking policy which minimizes 
average system cost per unit time. Necessary properties of an optimal policy were 
derived and the optimal solutions for the one-retailer and N identical retailer problems 
were given. Heuristic solutions for the general problem were also suggested, tested 
 6
discontinuous inventory issuing policy and an imperfect rework process on the optimal 
replenishment lot size of an integrated EPQ model. They assumed that the random 
defective items produced are partially repairable and the rework process is not perfect 
either, scrap items may be generated during the rework. Fixed quantity multiple 
installments of the finished batch can only be delivered to customers if the whole lot is 
quality assured at the end of rework. A closed-form optimal lot size solution to the 
problem was obtained. 
On improving the replenishment lot size solution derived by [1], this paper proposes a 
cost reduction distribution policy with the purpose of lowering producer’s stock holding 
cost. An n+1 delivery policy is introduced here in lieu of n multi-delivery plan in [1]. 
The joint effects of the n+1 multi-delivery policy and imperfect rework on the optimal 
replenishment lot size for this integrated EPQ model are studied. 
 
 
2.  Mathematical modeling and derivation 
 
Reexamine the specific EPQ model studied by Chiu et al. [1] which addressed two 
practical issues: the imperfect quality items produced and multi-delivery policy for 
transporting finished items. Assumptions of the model are as follow. Consider a 
manufacturing system which may produce x portion of random defective items at a 
production rate d. Among defective items, a θ portion is assumed to be scrap and the 
other (1-θ) portion can be reworked and repaired at a rate P1, within the same cycle 
when regular production ends. A θ1 portion (where 0<= θ1 <=1) of reworked items fails 
during the rework process and becomes scrap. Under the regular operating schedule, the 
constant production rate P is larger than the sum of demand rate λ and production rate of 
defective items d. That is: (P-d-λ)>0; where d can be expressed as d=Px. Let d1 denote 
production rate of scrap items during the rework process, then d1 can be expressed as 
d1=P1θ1. Under the proposed n+1 delivery policy, an initial installment of finished 
(perfect quality) products is distributed to customer for satisfying the demand during 
producer’s production uptime and rework time. Then, at the end of rework, when the rest 
of the production lot is quality assured, fixed quantity n installments of finished items 
are delivered to customer at a fixed interval of time. Such an n+1 delivery policy is 
intended to reduce supplier’s stock holding cost. 
The on-hand inventory of perfect quality items of the proposed model is depicted in 
Figure 1 (in black). The same for Chiu et al’s model [1] is illustrated in red. One notes 
that the yellow/shade area indicates the expected reduction in manufacturer’s stock 
holding costs which benefit results from applying the proposed model. 
The proposed system includes the following cost related parameters: setup cost K per 
production run, unit production cost C, unit holding cost h, unit rework cost CR, disposal 
cost per scrap item CS, holding cost h1 for each reworked item, fixed delivery cost K1 per 
 8
φxQ (Eq. (9)).

production cost, the setup cost, variable rework cost, disposal cost, (n+1) fixed 
distribution costs and variable delivery cost, holding cost for perfect quality items during 
production uptime t1 and reworking time t2, holding cost for defective items during t1, 
variable holding cost for items reworked during t2, and holding cost for finished goods 
during the delivery time t3 where n fixed-quantity installments of the finished batch are 
delivered to customers at a fixed interval of time (one can refer to Appendix-2 of [1] for 
detailed computations).

Taking into account of the randomness of defective rate x (which is assumed to be a 
random variable with a known probability density function), one can use the expected 
values of x in the related cost analysis. Substituting all related parameters from Eqs. (1) 
to (9) in TC(Q), one obtains the expected total E[TCU(Q)] (see Appendix A for details). 
 
 
3.  Proof of convexity and derivation of the optimal solution 
 
The optimal production lot size can be obtained by minimizing E[TCU(Q)]. 
Differentiating E[TCU(Q)] with respect to Q, the first and the second derivatives of 
E[TCU(Q)] are 
 10
scrap during rework. Other parameters include: K=$20,000; C=$100 per item; CR=$60 
per item reworked; CS=$20 per scrap item; h=$20; h1=$40 per item reworked; a fixed 
cost K1=$4,350 per shipment; and CT=$0.1 per item delivered.  
In order to show practical usages of our research results, the following two different 
scenarios are demonstrated, respectively. Scenario 1: Let total number of deliveries 
remain 4 (i.e. n=4 as was used in [1]). For the proposed model, it is (n+1)=4. An initial 
installment of finished products is distributed to customer during t1, for satisfying the 
product demand during producer’s production uptime and rework time. Then, at the end 
of rework, fixed quantity three other installments of finished items are delivered to 
customer at a fixed interval of time. Also, for the purpose of comparison, we use the 
lot-size solution Q=3,553 (from [1]) in calculating the production-inventory- delivery 
cost (i.e. Eqs. (11) of the proposed model) and obtain E[TCU(3553)]= $442,990. One 
notes that there is a reduction in manufacturer holding costs amounts to $11,356 (see Fig. 
2), or 11.03% of total other related costs (i.e. E[TCU(Q)]-(λC): total cost excludes the 
variable production cost).

policy as compared to that in Chiu et al. [1] 
 
Scenario 2: Let total number of deliveries remain 4 (that is (n+1)=4 in our model). By 
applying Eqs. (15) and (11), one obtains the optimal replenishment lot size Q*=4,271 
and the expected total costs E[TCU(Q*)]=$441,949, respectively. It is noted that overall 
reduction in production- inventory-delivery costs amounts to $12,397, or 12.16% of total 
other related costs. 
 
 
5.  Concluding remarks 
 
Chiu et al. [1] studied the optimal lot size for a manufacturing system with discontinuous 
issuing policy and imperfect rework. They adopted an n multi-delivery plan which starts 
at the end of rework process when the entire lot is quality assured. With the purpose of

severity of supply disruptions or in the behavior of unfilled 
demands. Makis and Fung [15] analyzed the effects of machine 
failures on the optimal lot size as well as on optimal number of 
inspections. Formulas for the long-run expected average cost per 
unit time was obtained. Then, the optimal production/inspection 
policy that minimizes the expected average costs was derived. 
Giri and Dohi [19] presented an exact formulation of stochastic 
EMQ model for an unreliable production system. Their model is 
formulated based on the net present value (NPV) approach, and 
by taking limitation on the discount rate the traditional long-run 
average cost model is obtained. They also provided the criteria for 
the existence and uniqueness of the optimal production time and 
computational results showing that the optimal decision based on 
the NPV approach is superior to that based on the long-run 
average cost approach. Chiu et al. [20] studied the optimal run 
time problem with scrap, the reworking of repairable defective 
items, and machine breakdown under no resumption (NR) policy. 
Formulas for the long-run expected average cost per unit time was 
derived. Theorems for convexity and bounds of run time were 
presented and a simple procedure for searching the optimal run 
time was provided. 
 
 
2.  MATHEMATICAL MODELLING 
 
Consider that there is a random defective rate x in a production 
system, and the nonconforming items produced cannot not be 
reworked; they are scrap and will be discarded soon after the end 
of production. This system is also subject to machine failure and it 
may take place randomly. An abort/resume (AR) inventory control 
policy is adopted when breakdown occurs. Under such a policy, 
the malfunction machine is under repair immediately and the 
interrupted lot will be resumed right after the restoration of 
machine. The repair time is assumed to be constant. To prevent 
shortage situation from happening, there is a safety stock policy in 
place to cope with the possibility of machine breakdown occurs in 
very earlier stage of the production. 
The production rate is a constant and is much larger than the 
demand rate λ. The production rate of defective items d can be 
expressed as the production rate times the defective rate: d=Px. 
The cost parameters considered in the proposed model include the 
setup cost K, unit production cost C, unit holding cost h, disposal 
cost per scrap item CS, and a fixed cost M for repairing and 
restoring the machine. Additional notations used are as follows. 
H1 = the level of on-hand inventory when machine 
breakdown occurs, 
H2 = the level of on-hand inventory when machine is repaired 
and restored, 
H3 = the level of on-hand inventory when machine is restored 
and the remaining production uptime is accomplished, 
Q = production lot size per cycle, 
t1 = the production uptime to be determined for the proposed 
model, 
t = time before a random breakdown occurs, 
β = number of breakdowns per year, a random variable 
follows a Poisson distribution, 
tr = time required for repairing the machine, 
t2’ = time needed for consuming all available good items 
when breakdown takes place, 
I(t) = on-hand inventory of perfect quality items at time t, 
Id(t) = on-hand inventory of defective items at time t, 
T’ = cycle length in the case of machine breakdown takes 
place, 
t2 = time required for depleting all available perfect quality 
items when machine breakdown does not occur, 
H4 = maximum level of on-hand inventory in units when 
production process ends, 
T = cycle length when machine breakdown does not occur, 
T = cycle length whether a machine breakdown or not, 
TC1(t1) = total inventory costs per cycle in the case of machine 
breakdown takes place, 
TC2(t1) = the total inventory costs per cycle when machine 
breakdown does not occur, 
TCU(t1) = the total inventory costs per unit time whether a 
breakdown takes place or not. 
 
Under regular supply, the basic assumption for EPQ model with 
random defective rate and shortages should be that the production 
rate of perfect quality items must always be greater than the sum 
of the demand rate and the production rate of defective items. 
Therefore, one should have (P-d-λ) >0. Let t denote the time 
before a breakdown taking place and t1 stands for the production 
uptime to be determined by this study in order to minimize the 
long-run average production-inventory cost. It is also assumed 
that during production uptime t1 machine failure may occur 
randomly, if the time to breakdown t < t1, then a random 
breakdown occurs during the production uptime t1. On the other 
hand, if t >= t1, then machine failure does not happen during t1. 
Hence, the aforementioned two situations are studied separately. 
 
EPQ model with random defective rate and stochastic breakdown 
 
First, the production time t before a machine breakdown taking 
place is smaller than the uptime t1. The abort/resume policy is 
adopted when random breakdown takes place. Under such a 
policy, production of the interrupted lot will be immediately 
resumed when the breakdown is fixed. The on-hand inventory 
level of perfect quality items when a breakdown occurs during t1 
is illustrated in Figure 1. 
 
 
 
Fig. 1 On-hand inventory of perfect quality items in EPQ model 
with random defective rate and stochastic breakdown 
 
The cycle length T’ contains production uptime t1, the time 
required for repairing the machine tr and the time needed for 
depleting all on-hand perfect quality items t2’ (as shown in Eq. 
(1)). The following solution procedure used by this paper is 
similar to what was presented by Chiu et al. [30]. From the 
assumption of the proposed model and Figure 1, one can obtain 
the following formulations directly

Hence, the proof of Theorem 1 is completed. 
In order to minimize the expected cost E[TCU(t1)], Eq. (24) 
must be satisfied. To search for the optimal value of t1* that yields 
minimum cost, one can set the first derivative of E[TCU(t1)] equal 
to 0. That gives

This study presents the following recursive searching algorithm 
for locating the economic production run time t1*: 
(1) Let α(t1)=0 and α(t1)=1 initially and compute the upper and 
lower bounds for t1*, respectively (i.e. to find the initial 
values of [t1L*, t1U*]). 
(2) Substitute the current values of [t1L*, t1U*] in 1te−β  and 
calculate the new bounds (denoted as δL and δU) for 1te−β . 
Hence, δL < α(t1) < δU. 
(3) Let α(t1)= δL and α(t1)= δU and compute the new upper and 
lower bounds for t1*, respectively (i.e. to update the current 
values of [t1L*, t1U*]). 
(4) Repeat steps 2 and 3, until there is no significant difference 
between t1L* and t1U* (or there is no significant difference in 
terms of their effects on E[TCU(t1*)]). 
(5) Stop. The optimal production run time t1* is obtained.
