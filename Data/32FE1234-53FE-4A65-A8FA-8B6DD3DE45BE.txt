Abstract 
Developing an effective vaccine against 
enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection provides the 
best means to control the disease.  This 
present work further investigated the virus 
growth and the immunogenicity of two high 
immunogenic strains (EV71-075 and 
EV71-117) prepared in serum-free 
microcarrier cell cultures.  Our results 
showed that serum free culture increased cell 
death rate after infection, reduced the virus 
specific productivity, but resulted in 
elicitation of higher neutralizing titers in 
immunized mice as compared to that parallel 
obtained in serum-containing cultures.  
Therefore, serum-free microcarrier culture is a 
valuable process for developing inactivated 
EV71 vaccines.

Introduction 
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a 
non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of 
the family Picornaviridae, first isolated in 
1969 in the United States [1].  EV71 
infection has caused a few outbreaks of 
hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) 
associated with severe neurological diseases 
in young children [2] and has become a 
serious public health problem in the 
Asia-Pacific region in these years [2-7].  
Since no effective antiviral agent exists to 
combat the EV71 infection, developing an 
effective vaccine against EV71 infection is 
the best strategy to control the disease.  
Recent studies have indicated that the 
inactivated EV71 virus vaccine produced 
from Vero cells elicited a more effective 
immune response than the recombinant VP1 
protein or DNA vector vaccines in mice [8]. 
Vero cells are a regulation-accepted cell 
line for human vaccine production and have 
been used to produce human polio and rabies 
vaccines [9-11].  Since Vero cells are 
anchorage-dependent, microcarrier 
technology was developed for establishing a 
large-scale cell culture process for vaccine 
production [12].  Recently, a trend of 
microcarrier technology has been to utilize 
serum-free culture to overcome the drawbacks 
include high serum-protein content for 
complicating downstream purification process 
and the risk for potential contamination of 
prions due to bovine resource [13, 14].  
Serum-free microcarrier cell culture process 
has been developed for cultured Vero cells for 
the vaccine production against poliovirus [15], 
reovirus [16], Japanese encephalitis virus [17], 
rabies [18], and recently for EV71 [19]. 
We have reported that large-scale 
preparation of a low immunogenic EV71 
strain can be achieved using serum free Vero 
Bethesda, MD, USA. 
 
Preparation of inactivated EV71s and mouse 
immunization 
 Virus stocks (the viral titer was 4.0 
x 107 TCID50/mL) were mixed with a 37% 
formaldehyde solution (Merck) at a volume 
ratio of 4000:1 ratio and stored at 4oC for 35 
days for virus inactivation.  The inactivated 
virus stocks were absorbed on aluminum 
phosphate at room temperature for 1 hour and 
at 4oC for 1 day before immunization.  A 
group of 5 female ICR mice (12-15 g, 3-4 
weeks after birth) were immunized 
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.5 mL of the 
alum-absorbed inactivated EV71s (the viral 
titer was 1.0 x 107 TCID50/0.5mL), and the 
same doses were boosted after three weeks 
after first immunization.  The immunized 
mice were bled one week after the boost, and 
the serum was collected and used in the 
analysis of virus neutralization. 
 
Neutralizing assays for mouse antibodies 
The serum samples were collected from 
immunized mice and were inactivated at 56oC 
for 30 min.  Each serum sample was added 
to a microtube and diluted in a two-fold serial 
dilution using fresh medium.  The four 
hundred microliter of a 200 TCID50 virus 
suspension was added to each tube that 
contains 400 micro-liter serial diluted serums.  
After incubation at 4oC for 18-24 hours, 100 
micro-liter of serially diluted samples were 
added to Vero cells in 96-well plates.  The 
cultures in 96-well plates were incubated for 
seven days at 37oC, and the TCID50 values 
were measured by counting the cytopathic 
effects in infected Vero cells.  The 50% 
neutralization inhibition dose (ID50) that is the 
geometric reciprocal of the serum dilution 
yielding 50% reduction in the virus titer was 
obtained using the software, ID-50 5.0. 
 
Cloning and sequence analysis of EV71 VP1 
protein 
Viral RNA was extracted from the 
culture medium using TRIzol reagent 
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's 
instructions.  The cDNA was synthesized 
using Superscript II RTase (Invitrogen) 
reverse transcriptase and a primer 
(5’-ggactgctgtccaaatttcccgag-3’) by reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) at 42 oC for 2 hours.  The 
double-strand DNA was carried out by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 
Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) 
with a pair of primers (Forward: 
5’-actggatccatggggtttcctactgagctg-3’, Reverse: 
5’-ggactgctgtccaaatttcccgag-3’) for 35 cycles 
(94 oC x 15sec, 50 oC x 30 seconds and 68 oC 
x 2min).  The DNA was purified by 
Gel/PCR DNA fragments extraction kit 
(Geneaid, Taiwan).  The PCR products were 
added A-tail using Taq enzyme at 68 oC for 1 
hour, and ligation using T4 ligase (MBI) with 
pGEM T-easy (Promega) at 22 oC for 3 hours.  
The ligation products were transfected into E. 
coli (Top 10) by 42 oC hot-shock for 90 sec 
and selected using Amp-resistant LB agar 
plate.  These colonies were transferred into 2 
mL LB broths with Amp, and purified by 
High-Speed plasmid mini kit (Geneaid, 
Taiwan).  Viral genome sequencing was 
conducted by Mission Biotech Inc., Taipei, 
Taiwan.  The genome sequences of EV71 
VP1 protein were aligned by using the 
software, Clustal W program.  Phylogenetic 
analysis of EV71 based on the VP1 sequences 
was constructed using the software, MEGA 
3.1.  The phylogenetic tree for 17 different 
strains was constructed using the 
neighbor-joining method as previously 
reported [6]. 
 
 
Results 
High immunogenic EV71 strains 
Three EV71 strains (EV71-075, 
EV71-117, and EV71-1207) were harvested 
from serum-containing microcarrier Vero cell 
culture and used for mouse immunization to 
investigate the immunogenicity.  The 
harvested EV71 virions were inactivated with 
formalin at 4oC for 35 days, and the 
inactivated EV71s were injected into a group 
of ICR mice on a three-week immunization 
schedule.  Serum samples were taken 1 week 
after each boost and tested for immunization.  
The immunization results showed that the 
neutralization ID50 values obtained from two 
Using glucose/glutamine feedings during 
infection may enhance the virus titers by 
extending the cell life as we previously 
reported [19].  The enhanced 
immunogenicity of EV71 virions produced in 
serum-free microcarrier Vero cell culture was 
in agreement with the result reported for 
rabies virus vaccine production [18].  The 
enhanced immunogenicity of the inactivated 
virions produced in serum-free cultures may 
be due to the increase of antigen content 
resulting from the noninfectious particles 
produced in serum-free cultures, as the dose 
for immunization was only based on the 
infectious particles (1.0 x 107 TCID50 per 
mouse in 0.5 mL alum absorption).  It is also 
possible that the virions produced in 
serum-free culture may give better antigen 
stability as reported for reovirus [16]. 
The high immunogenic strains of 
EV71-075 and EV71-117 were also analyzed 
for VP1 sequences and compared with a low 
immunogenic strain (EV71-1207) [19].  
Although the VP1 amino acid sequences were 
identical for EV71-075 and EV71-117 strains, 
we also further characterized the sequences of 
these three strains with other 17 strains by 
constructing VP1-based phylogenetic tree 
analysis similar to previous reports [6, 7].  
Our results showed that these two high 
immunogenic strains (EV71-075 and 
EV71-117) belong to B4 subgenotype, while 
the low immunogenic EV71-1207 strain 
belongs to the C2 subgenotype.  In addition, 
our modeling structure constructed based on 
the VP1 structure of bovine enterovirus 
Vg-5-27 strain [20] further indicates that 6 out 
of 12 residues (145, 164, 184, 240, 249, and 
289) on VP1 protein may be of greater 
importance to influence neutralizing antibody 
response.  These results obtained from two 
high immunogenic EV71 strains in serum-free 
microcarrier Vero cell cultures provide 
valuable information for EV71 vaccine 
development.
