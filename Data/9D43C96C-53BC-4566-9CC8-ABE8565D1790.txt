Abstract
A novel method (the V-shaped curve) is presented to predict the failure probability of anisotropic conductive film (ACF) in IC/substrate
assemblies. The Poisson function is used to calculate the probability of opening failure in the vertical gap between the pads, while the box and
modified box models are used to estimate the probability of bridging failure between the pads in the pitch direction. The opening and bridging
probabilities are combined using probability theory to establish four different failure prediction models. The results reveal that the model
combining the Poisson function for fewer than six particles per pad with the modified box model provides the most accurate predictions of the
failure probability of ACF in IC/substrate assemblies.

1. Introduction
Anisotropic conductive film (ACF) consists of adhesive
resins and conducting particles. ACF is widely used in
packaging technologies for liquid crystal displays (LCD)
and flat panel displays (FPD). ACF provides unidirectional
conductivity in the vertical direction and insulation in the
pitch direction. Fig. 1 presents a schematic illustration of a
typical cross-section of an IC/substrate assembly packed
with ACF. Fig. 2 shows that normal, bridging and opening
conditions in the ACF assembly.
It has been reported that in IC/substrate assemblies with an
inter-pad spacing of 50 mm, the use of an ACF with five
particles per pad ensures a stable contact resistance during
testing at high temperatures (85 8C) and relative humidities
85% [1,2]. A density of more than five particles per pad is
required if a reliable contact resistance between the IC and the
substrate is to be ensured. A density of fewer than six particles
per electrode is unacceptable. A defect (fewer than six particles
per electrode) occurrence probability of less than 10K9 ensures
a stable quality level in the electrical performance of the IC/
substrate assembly. However, an excessive number of
dispersed particles in the ACF may cause electrical short
circuits (i.e. a bridging effect between the pads in the pitch
direction). From the above, it is clear that designing ACF IC/
substrate assemblies requires the ability to determine the
optimum volume fraction for any particular IC/substrate
geometry. Consequently, developing failure prediction
methods for ACF IC/substrate assemblies is an important
research task.
The present analysis develops two models to predict the
occurrence of the opening effect, namely the Poisson function
for zero particles on the pad and the Poisson function for less
than six particles on the pad. Other two models are introduced
to predict the occurrence of bridging failure, namely the box
model [3] and the modified box model [4]. The individual
opening and bridging models are then combined using
probability theory to construct four separate failure analysis
models.
2. Opening circuit analysis using Poisson function
The Poisson function given in Eq. (1) estimates the
probability of there being n particles located on a pad [3]:

4. Failure analysis and V-shaped curve method
In the current study, the failure probability of the ACF
IC/substrate assembly (where failure means that the IC/Sub-
strate assembly cannot function) can be defined in terms of the
individual opening and bridging failure probabilities. Hence,
the failure probability (i.e. the probability that opening or
bridging occurs) can be expressed as:
POgPBZPOCPBKPOhPB (9)
where POgPB is the probability of opening or bridging; PO is
the probability of opening; PB is the probability of bridging;
and POhPB is the probability of both opening and bridging.
If opening and bridging are considered to be independent
events, the overall failure probability, POhPB, can be
expressed as:
POhPBZPOPB (10)
Substituting Eq. (10) into Eq. (9), and defining the failure
probability in the IC/substrate assembly as POgPB, the failure
probability can be formulated as:
Pfailureðf ÞZPOgPBZPOCPBKPOPB (11)
The above equation can then be processed using numerical
methods to calculate the bridging probability for specified
values of d*, h*, l* and f. The resulting failure probability
function has the form of a V-shaped curve, whose tip
corresponds to the lowest failure probability and associated
volume fraction. Hence, the minimum failure probability
can be found by differentiating Eq. (11) with respect to the
volume fraction, i.e.
d½Pfailureðf Þ
df
Z 0 (12)
The solution of Eq. (12) gives the optimum volume
fraction, i.e. the volume fraction, which minimizes the
overall failure probability.
Table 1 summarizes the opening and bridging models
used in the current failure analysis. As shown, a total of
four failure analysis models are constructed, i.e.
(PIOgP
I
Bðf Þ, PIOgPIIBðf Þ, PIIOgPIBðf Þ, and PIIOgPIIBðf Þ).
5. Results and discussions
Fig. 4 presents the V-shaped curves corresponding to the four
failure analysis models for geometry conditions of d*Z20, h*Z
5, and l*Z10. For a specificACF compound, the volume fraction
is determined by the geometry of the pads, i.e. d, h, and l, and the
radius of the particles, i.e. r. In the current study, the same
geometry conditions are used throughout, and Fig. 4 shows that
the four failure predictionmodels yield fourdifferent valuesof the
optimum volume fraction (as indicated by the tips of the curves)
and four different lowest failure probabilities. The volume
fraction and failure probability results for each of the fourmodels
are presented in thefirst two rowsofTable2. It canbe seen that the
PIIOgP
II
Bðf Þ model, which combines the Poisson function for
fewer than six particles with the modified box model, generates
the highest failure probability. In Fig. 5, themisestimated volume
fractions predicted by the other three models are substituted into
thePIIOgP
II
Bðf Þmodel and the corresponding failure probabilities
computed. The results are presented in the lower row of Table 2.
From Fig. 5 and Table 2, it can be seen that models

misestimated failure probabilities of 5.2!10K11, 9.5!10K10,
and 1.1!10K8, respectively. In fact, these misestimated volume
fraction in the curve tip will lead the failure probability up to
2.1!10K6, 2.1!10K5, and 2.7!10K6 (misestimated volume
fraction 0.126, 0.112, and 0.171 are substituted into
PIIOgP

Abstract
This paper models a real-time reliability prediction system for application in the anisotropic conductive film (ACF) manufacturing process.
The prediction system contains three major hardware/software components, namely an X-ray detection apparatus, finite element method (FEM)
modeling and simulations, and post-manufacturing reliability analysis and quality control. Initially, an X-ray detection apparatus is used to scan
the particle distribution in the ACF as it flows towards the roller. In the scanning operation, the coordinates of each particle are obtained and passed
to a PC. Based on this scanning information, a FEM computational mesh of the ACF sample is generated in which each grid node corresponds to
an individual particle. The ACF mesh is then integrated with an FEM model of the IC/substrate assembly and the relevant geometry parameters
defined, i.e. the pad height, the pad length, the pad pitch, and the particle radius. Compression simulations are performed using DEFORM or
ALPID software and the corresponding particle flow and redistribution calculated. A reliability analysis of the redistributed particle pattern is then
performed based upon the probabilities of both opening and bridging effects. The real-time reliability prediction system modeled in this paper
provides an effective reliability analysis and quality control scheme for the processing of ACF compounds.

1. Introduction
Anisotropic conductive film (ACF) has been widely used over
the past decade for the packaging of flat panel displays (FPD),
such as liquid crystal displays (LCD), and for attaching bare
chips to both flexible and rigid substrates. ACF consists of adhe-
sive resins and conducting metallic or metal-coated polymer
particles and is designed to provide unidirectional conductivity
in the vertical, i.e. Z-axis direction. Fig. 1 presents a schematic
illustration of a typical ACF assembly cross-section. It can be
seen that the volume fraction loading is designed to be suffi-
ciently low that inter-particle contact is prevented. In this way,
conductivity in the pitch direction (i.e. bridging) is avoided [1].
In general, packaging technologies should provide high-
resolution, low-weight and thin interconnection solutions, and
should minimize the material necessary to accomplish the joint.
ACF is ideally suited to the packaging of small pitch assemblies

such as those found in flip chip applications. Generally, ACF
packaging offers a number of key advantages, including: (a) a
fine pitch capability; (b) a low temperature processing capabil-
ity (resulting in reduced thermal stress during processing); (c)
low cost flexible processing; (d) a viable alternative to lead or
other toxic metals; and (e) a compatibility with a wide range
of surfaces [2]. Intensive research and development has been
carried out in the fields of flip chip and chip-on-glass (COG)
technology using ACF as an alternative to traditional soldering
methods [3,4]. Essentially, the ACF binding process is the same
as that of compression molding [5,6], and hence the same mate-
rial properties (i.e. the volume fraction, flow–stress relationship,
viscosity and material processing parameters) must be obtained
if its characteristics and performance are to be analyzed. In the
ACF compound manufacturing process, the conductive particles
are randomly distributed in the adhesive resin. During compres-
sion, the particle flow within the resin matrix is a major factor
influencing the occurrence of opening and bridging failures (pre-
sented schematically in Fig. 2).
The reliability of the IC/substrate assembly is strongly depen-
dent on the particle distribution in the lateral direction. In a

2.2.2. Compression analysis
The compression simulations can be performed using
DEFORM-3D or ALPID commercial software. In the simula-
tions, the compound mesh is introduced into the gap between
the IC/substrate and a constant strain (reduction ratio) is then
applied to compress the ACF compound. During the compres-
sion molding process, the ACF compound flows into the gap

between the IC and the substrate causing a redistribution of the
particles in the resin. The lateral displacement of the particles is
identified by tracking the changes in the individual node posi-
tions. Following compression, the final particle locations are
recorded in the analysis database.
2.2.3. Post-processing
Using the simulation results, post-processing reliability anal-
ysis is performed to evaluate the failure probability of the ACF as
a result of opening and/or bridging effects. As discussed below,
the global failure probability is computed based on the particle
volume fraction following compression, the particle size, and
the IC/substrate geometry parameters, i.e. the pad size, the pad
pitch, and the pad number.
2.3. Reliability analysis
2.3.1. V-shaped curve method
The V-shaped curve method provides an indication of the
failure reliability of the ACF compound for a specified particle
distribution, and is based on an assessment of both the opening
and the bridging probabilities. Hence, the failure probability in
the local area is expressed as:
Popening∪bridging = Popening + Pbridging − Popening∩bridging (2)
C.-M. Lin et al. / Materials Science and Engineering A 432 (2006) 239–244 243
Fig. 6. Opening effect index O(i,j) and bridging effect index B(m,n) in pad array.
In the above case, Eq. (4) can be expressed as a single variable
(volume fraction φo) in the following equation:
Pfailure(φo) = Popening(φo) + Pbridging
(
Vφ − 2rl2Nφo
V − 2rl2N
)
−Popening(φo) Pbridging
(
Vφ − 2rl2Nφo
V − 2rl2N
)
(13)
Eq. (13) can be solved and obtained an optimal volume frac-
tion in a lowest failure probability by differenting Eq. (13) with
respect to φo.
If all of the pads in the IC/substrate are considered, then Eqs.
(14) and (15) give the global opening and bridging probabili-
ties, respectively. Note that the opening effect index, O(i,j), and
the bridging effect index, B(i,j), are illustrated schematically in
Fig. 6.

(15)
where PGopening and P
G
bridging are global probability in the opening
and bridging, respectively.
2.3.2. Inclusion–Exclusion Principal
The overall global failure probability can be computed
by using the Inclusion–Exclusion Principal with the numer-
ical computation. Eqs. (17) and (18) are the formula of the
Inclusion–Exclusion Principal. To calculate P(O1∪ O2∪ . . .
∪On), first find all of the possible intersections of events from
O1, O2, . . ., On and calculate their probabilities. Then add the
probabilities of those intersections that are formed of an odd
number of events, and subtract the probabilities of those formed
of an even number of events [13]. The right hand side of the
Eqs. (17) and (18) will show many terms with a lot of pads.
Hence, an effective technique must be provided to calculate the
global probability with the unknown pads number. In our cases,
the computational unit of the four events is used to calculate the
complex formula.
The four events unit is formulated by the following
equation:
P(O1 ∪ O2 ∪ O3 ∪ O4)
= P(O1) + P(O2) + P(O3) + P(O4) − P(O1O2)
−P(O1O3) − P(O1O4) − P(O2O3) − P(O2O4)
−P(O3O4) + P(O1O2O3) + P(O1O2O4)
+P(O1O3O4) + P(O2O3O4) − P(O1O2O3O4) (16)
The next step is to combine the P(O5), P(O6), and P(O7)
with the result of the Eq. (16) and to calculate the their
unions. Similarly, a sequential calculation will present the global
probability.
Since the opening effects are independent on all the pads, Eq.
(14) can be expressed in the form shown in Eq. (17). Similarly,
Eq. (15) can be rewritten as Eq. (18). Eqs. (17) and (18) therefore
represent expressions for all the global opening and bridging
probabilities, respectively.
