1. Introduction 
Inventory includes raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. The approach proposed in this 
project can be applied to the warehouse management of raw materials and finished goods. The purpose of 
inventory is to fulfill various requests by customers, when the acceptable waiting time of customers is shorter 
than the supply lead time. Under such conditions, warehouse should make inventory ready before the 
customers arrive. How to effectively manage inventory to meet demand is an important management issue, 
especially when expected demand is more than current on-hand inventory. 
A well-known inventory control approach called ),( Ss  policy is commonly used in practice. When 
on-hand inventory is less than or equal to re-order point s , the warehouse will issue an order to suppliers or 
manufacturers to bring up the inventory position to the target level S . Thus, the quantity that the warehouse 
request is not a fixed value. There is a lead time delay between the issue of order and the receipt of goods and 
we call such a delay as replenishment lead time, or briefly, lead time, in the following presentation. Also, it is 
not uncommon that lead time is not a known constant parameter and has a certain degree of variation. 
Furthermore, the number of arrival customers and the request quantity of each customer arrives during the 
lead time are also unknown at present time. Because many uncertain factors exist in an inventory problem, 
stock-out might happen, especially, when a major unexpected event occurs. Such events may cause that the 
demand exceeds the original projected value or lead time is much longer than expected value.  
The project considers two types of problem environments. The first environment is that there is a clear 
classification among customer requests and requests are categorized into multiple priority classes. We prefer 
to fulfill the higher priority requests than lower priority requests. The second environment is that requests are 
categorized into multiple classes according to different shortage costs. The higher the class, the higher the 
shortage cost. The objective of inventory rationing is minimizing total shortage cost. When a request arrives, a 
manager must decide whether to fulfill this request or reject this request. The focus of this project is to 
develop inventory rationing decision models to dynamically allocate inventory during lead time to comply the 
class of inventory requests. 
The simplest approach to handle these problems is using the first-come-first-served (FCFS) rule which 
fulfills every arrival customer as long as the warehouse has enough on-hand inventory. This approach is the 
simplest one and is commonly used in practice. However, adopting this rule is likely to lose the ability to 
 3 
levels of importance and may impose different penalties. Therefore, the shortage costs are different for 
different requests. In practice, requests are categorized into several demand classes and each of the class has a 
different shortage cost. Rejecting a higher class request imposes a larger shortage cost. Also, each arrival 
request may request for a different quantity. At the time of each request arrival, we must determine whether or 
not to fulfill a request from the available inventory. Under the stochastic arrival of random requests, the 
objective of the problem is to minimize the total shortage cost of unfulfilled requests. Suppose that requests 
are categorized into two classes which the unit shortage cost of the class 1 is higher than that of class 2 and 
the existing inventory is only sufficient to fulfill a class 1 request or to fulfill two class 2 requests. Under such 
a condition that total shortage cost of the two class 2 requests is higher than the shortage cost of class 1 
request, in order to minimize the total shortage cost, we will fulfill the two class 2 requests and reject the class 
1 request. The decision is different from that in the first environment, in which we will reject class 2 as long 
as there is demand for class 1. Thus, to minimize total shortage cost, we might reserve inventory for future 
requests in anticipation of reducing total shortage cost by rejecting the current request, even its priority 
belongs to the highest class. 
This report is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of related literature. Section 3 introduces 
concepts, notations and assumptions of the proposed model used for solving the problems in the first 
environment. Besides, the section discusses dynamic stochastic inventory rationing (DSIR) decision 
procedure and risk level inventory rationing decision procedure (RLIR) decision procedure. Then, section 4 
illustrates the concepts, assumptions and notations of the proposed approach used for solving the problems in 
the second environment. Also, the section describes sampling expected cost gap (SECG) decision procedure. 
Finally, we make a conclusion on this project in Section 5.

the critical levels in the lost sales inventory model. Benjaafar et al. (2010) studied a production-inventory 
system with a single product and two demand classes where both backorders and lost sales were allowed. 
Continuing these studies under the assumptions of multiple demand classes and use of reserve levels, 
Nahmias and Demmy (1981) determine expected unfilled rates and developed methods to construct tables 
which allowed the users to choose the reserve level, reorder point, and order quantity to meet a desired fill rate 
rather than minimizing a cost function. Moon and Kang (1998) performed four analytical and simulation 
models to improve the existing models, including the models of Nahmias and Demmy (1981). Firstly, they 
used multiple reserve levels instead of using a single reserve level. Secondly, they used a simulation model 
adopting more realistic assumptions on the demand arrival process. Thirdly, they employed rationing trigger 
times rather than reserve levels to make decisions. Finally, they addressed a continuous review model under a 
compound Poisson process. 
 
2.2. Stochastic supply environments 
In an actual inventory environment, there are uncertainties in both supplies and demands. Since the 
replenishment lead time, arrival time and quantity of each request are unknown at the present time, the 
assumption that these values are modeled as random variables are reasonable. Ha (1997) considered a 
make-to-stock production system and a production facility that produced a single item to be stocked with 
several demand classes. A simple queuing model was analyzed to compute the operating cost of a rationing 
policy. Dekker et al. (2002) analyzed a lot-for-lot or (S-1, S) inventory model with several demand classes. 
Ayanso et al. (2006) developed an inventory rationing policy that was of interest to e-tailers, operating in a 
business to consumer (B2C) environment and selling non-perishable, make-to-stock product. A Monte Carlo 
simulation model was performed to examine this policy under that the demand arrival process and lead time 
were stochastic. Tan et al. (2009) relied the on imperfect advance demand information to estimate the future 
demand that helped to make better decisions through decreasing uncertainty on future demand.  
 
2.3. Dynamic rationing strategy 
Unlike earlier inventory models, recent studies focus on dynamic rationing approaches instead of static 
rationing policies. Teunter and Haneveld (2008) analyzed dynamic rationing approaches with two demand 
 7 
3. The decision procedures used for solving the first environment 
There is a clear classification among customer requests and requests are categorized into multiple 
priority classes. We prefer to fulfill the higher priority requests than lower priority requests. When a customer 
request arrives, the warehouse has to decide whether to fulfill or to reject. This section presents two decision 
procedures that are modified from the dynamic stochastic capacity rationing (DSCR) decision procedure 
originally proposed by Hung and Lee (2007). These two procedures are called as dynamic stochastic 
inventory rationing (DSIR) decision procedure and risk level inventory rationing (RLIR) decision procedure.  
Section 3.1 illustrates the concepts, assumptions and notations that are used in the proposed decision 
procedures. Section 3.2 and section 3.3 discuss two decision procedures, respectively, that help warehouse 
managers make a decision each time a customer request arrives. Section 3.4 presents results of simulation 
experiments compared with other inventory rationing policies. 
 
3.1. Concepts, Assumptions, and Notations 
 The above discussion indicates that it is important to adopt inventory rationing policy when expected 
demand is more than available inventory during replenishment lead time. We can employ an inventory 
rationing policy when there is a risk of stock-out for high priority requests. For example, in an ),( Ss  
inventory system, when on-hand inventory drops to re-order point s , the warehouse will issue an 
replenishment order to bring the inventory position up to the target level S . When the replenishing order is 
issued, the inventory rationing policy should be deployed to protect the high priority requests from the 
overuse by low priority requests. From this moment on, when a customer request arrives, managers should 
decide whether to fulfill or to reject the request based on available information that includes such as the 
request quantity by the customer, current on-hand inventory and the projection of future requests. Four basic 
features of inventory rationing policy are outlined below: 
1. When a customer request arrives, inventory rationing policy should make a decision of whether to fulfill or  
not quickly. 
2. It should be able to justify the rejection of lower priority requests even if there is available inventory. 
3. It should be able to justify the fulfillment of lower priority requests when there is chance of arrival of high 
priority request.

ktNkt RRRY L++= 21 ,              (1) 
where ktN  is the number of the customers with priority class higher than k  that arrive in the future. 
Since the request quantity of each customer is assumed to be a normal distribution with mean Qµ  and 
variance 2Qσ , the probability density function of ktY  can be calculated by conditioning on the number of the 
customers ( ktN ) within the time interval ],( Lt .

where )|(| nNYf ktktNY ktkt =  is the conditional probability density function of ktY  when the number of 
the future customers with priority class higher than k  is n . By the well-known addition property of normal 
distribution, the sum of n  mutually independent normal random variables with mean µ  and variance 2σ  
is also a normal distribution with mean µn  and variance 2σn . That is, )|(| nNYf ktktNY ktkt =  in equation (2) 
is a normal distribution with mean Qnµ  and variance 2Qnσ . 
( )nNP kt =  is the probability that the number of the future customers with priority class higher than k  
is n  before the arrival of replenishment. At current time t , we know that the replenishment order has not 
arrived yet. It means that the probability of lead time smaller than t  is 0 and the probability of lead time later 
than t  is 1. Hence, we can calculate ( )nNP kt =  by conditioning on the probability of lead time:

The first square bracket in the summation of equation (5) is the integral of the probability density 
function of ktY  between I  and ∞ , given that there are n  normally distributed customer requests. The 
second square bracket is the probability that there are n  future customer requests with priority class higher 
than k  that arrive before the arrival of replenishment. When there is no future customer request )0( =n , the 
probability that total request quantity between )0( >II  and ∞  is zero. Therefore, the summation can start 
from 1, instead of starting from 0.

3.3. Risk Level Inventory Rationing decision procedure 
This section uses the concept of risk level to make rationing decision. A risk level is a maximum 
 17
α  is the maximum desirable risk level of stock-out for higher priority request during lead time; that is, it 
is the maximum acceptable probability that there is no sufficient inventory for the future higher priority 
requests if we fulfill the current customer request. Whereas, ip  represents the probability that the total 
quantity of the future higher priority requests is greater than on-hand inventory minus the current customer 
request. Hence, after fulfilling the current request, if the probability that higher priority requests will 
encounter stock-out is greater than pre-specified risk level, we should reject the current customer request. That 
is, if ip  is greater than α , the decision should be rejecting the current request. On the other hand, if ip  is 
less than or equal to α , the decision should be fulfilling the current request. 
 
3.4. Computer experiments and analysis 
 Five decision procedures have been discussed in previous sections: the first-come-first-served decision 
rule (FCFS), the Haynsworth and Price rationing model (briefly, H&P in the following presentation), the 
dynamic stochastic inventory rationing decision procedure (DSIR), the risk level inventory rationing decision 
procedure (RLIR), and the solution with perfect information (PI). The FCFS approach takes earliest requests 
as long as there is sufficient on-hand inventory by FCFS decision rule. Each time a customer arrives, the H&P 
approach determines whether to ration for high priority customer or not according to H&P calculation. Each 
time a customer arrives, the DSIR approach compares the probability that fulfill is a correct decision with the 
probability that reject is a correct decision by DSIR decision procedure. Each time a customer arrives, the 
RLIR approach determines whether to fulfill the customer request by calculating RLIR decision procedure. 
The PI approach chooses which customer requests to fulfill under complete knowledge of each arrival 
customer by PI decision rule. The purpose of following simulation experiments is to validate the effectiveness 
of the proposed decision procedures by the performance measure of the fill rate. 
Two different problem conditions are simulated in the experiments of this section. In order compare with 
the previous studies, the first problem condition, presented in section 3.4.1, assumes that the replenishment 
lead time is a fixed constant, request quantity of all arrival customers are fixed at one, and the number of 
priority classes is two levels. The second problem condition, presented in section 3.4.2, generalizes the 
replenishment lead time to a random normal distribution and the request quantity also to a random normal 
distribution and extend the number of priority classes to three levels. Such generalization will make our 
 19
experiments. For all rationing approaches, we observe that the request with higher priority has higher average 
fill rate than the one with lower priority. Besides, the overall fill rate of each rationing approaches is lower 
than the overall fill rate of FCFS. The reason is that a rationing approach would sacrifice a number of priority 
2 requests to reserve inventory for priority 1 requests. Therefore, the performance in both priority 2 fill rate 
overall fill rate of each rationing approach is not as good as FCFS.

Table 3 shows the Duncan test for comparisons of the priority 1 fill rate under five approaches. We 
observe that the five approaches are classified into four distinct subsets, which RLIR(0.05) and PI approaches 
belong to the same subset. The results means that the priority 1 fill rate simulated by the five approaches are 
significantly different except that RLIR(0.05) and PI approaches are not significantly different from each 
other. Use “~” to represent “not significantly different” and “A>B” to represent that approach A is better than 
approach B. In terms of priority 1 fill rate, RLIR(0.05) ~ PI > H&P(0.05)>DSIR>FCFS. The proposed 
approach RLIR(0.05) and perfect information approach are in the same subset (not statistically significantly 
different) and they outperform all other approaches.

rp  will be increased. Keep decreasing on-hand inventory, we will have a boundary on-hand inventory value 
that makes fp  equal to rp . If the on-hand inventory is below this boundary value, rp  is greater than fp ; 
the decision is to reject all priority 2 requests. On the other hand, if the on-hand inventory is above this 
boundary, fp  is greater than rp , the decision is to fulfill all priority 2 requests. Therefore, this boundary 
value is the reserved quantity for priority 1 request at current time. As the time increases to the replenishment 
arrival, the distribution curve of the priority 1 will be shifted to the left, this boundary value, or reserved 
quantity, will be decreased. Similarly, we can calculate the reserved quantity for RLIR. To compare the 
reserved quantity of DSIR and RLIR with that of H&P, we calculate the reserved quantity at fixed intervals 
for DSIR and RLIR(0.05) to approximate the continuous reserved curves of them. Here, we set the arrival rate 
of priority 1 request to 0.3 and risk level to 0.05 to observe the reserved quantity for each approach. Also, for 
DSIR and RLIR(0.05), the number of time interval is 20. Figure 6 shows the reserved quantity for priority 1 
request of three approaches, DSIR, RLIR(0.05), and H&P(0.05). Obviously, the reserved quantity of 
H&P(0.05) is higher than other two approaches in most time intervals except the last one. It is because DSIR 
and RLIR(0.05) still ration for priority 1 request during the last time interval but H&P(0.05) does not. Also, it 
confirms to the results that H&P(0.05) and RLIR(0.05) have higher priority 1 fill rate than DSIR.

Table 11 shows the Duncan test of the priority 1 fill rates under the six approaches. These six approaches 
are classified into four distinct subsets. In terms of the performance in priority 1 fill rate, PI outperforms 
RLIR(with different risk levels), which outperforms DSIR. The last one is FCFS.

six approaches are significantly different from each other. PI > FCFS > DSIR > RLIR(0.10) > RLIR(0.05) > 
RLIR(0.01). The performance in overall fill rate of RLIR is the worst. The reason is that RLIR rations more 
inventory for priority 1 request than other approaches so that it sacrifices lower priority fill rate and overall fill 
rate, especially the one with lowest value of risk level.

the reserved quantity for RLIR is higher than DSIR. Also, for RLIR, the one with lower value of risk level, the 
reserved quantity is higher than others with higher value of risk level. Therefore, RLIR reserve inventory for 
priority 1 request more aggressive than DSIR and it confirms to the result presented above.

In conclusion, we learn about the following things. First, although the priority 1 fill rate of RLIR is 
nearly the same as PI under all kind of situation, but it sacrifices more lower priority requests. Therefore, the 
performance in overall fill rate for RLIR is not as good as DSIR. Second, whether higher priority rate or 
overall fill rate, DSIR performs well at them. Hence, if the manager wants to emphasize the priority 1 fill rate 
more extremely, the manager could adopt the RLIR. On the other hand, if the manager wants to raise fill rate 
of higher priority requests and keep overall fill rate at the same time, the manager should adopt DSIR. 
The programs are coded in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU 3.00GHz personal 
computer with 2.00 GB RAM is used to run the experiments. By timing the execution time of the above 
experiment, the average CPU time for one DSIR computation is about 0.42 seconds and for one RLIR

4. The decision procedure used in the second environment 
In inventory management, the warehouse usually set different levels of importance for different requests; 
therefore, different requests impose different penalties. In practice, the requests are categorized into different 
class of shortage cost. When a request arrives during lead time, the warehouse must immediately make a 
decision on whether or not to fulfill this request from the available inventory with the objective of minimizing 
total shortage cost. This section presents the decision procedure that is motivated by Hung and Chen’s 
expected revenue gap (ERG) for airlines. The proposed decision procedure is called as sampling expected cost 
gap (SECG) decision procedure. Section 4.1 illustrates the concepts, assumptions and notations of the 
proposed decision procedure. Sampling expected cost gap decision procedure is discussed in the section 4.2. 
Section 4.3 compares the proposed approach with other approaches by computer simulation through a full 
factorial experimental design. 
 
4.1. Concepts, assumptions and notations 
The assumptions of the second environment used in this project are as follows. 
(1) Requests are categorized into several classes based on different unit shortage costs. The higher the class, 
the higher the unit shortage cost. 
(2) The arrival of requests is a Poisson process. That is, if the arrival rate of the Poisson process is λ  
(arrivals per unit time), the numbers of arrival requests within a time interval with length L  is a Poisson 
distribution with parameter Lλ . Furthermore, the time between the arrivals of two consecutive requests is an 
exponential distribution with parameter 1λ . 
(3) The quantity of each arrival requests is mutually independent. We assume the quantity of requests is a 
normal random variable with mean Qµ  and variance 2Qσ . 
(4) Let L  be the lead time and it is usually an uncertain parameter in actual inventory environments. We 
assume lead time is a normal distribution with mean Lµ  and variance 2Lσ . 
(5) The decision for each request is fully fulfilled or totally rejected; that is, partial fulfillment is not allowed. 
 
 The following are notations for SECG under the assumptions mentioned above. 
 43
including the class, the quantity, and arrival time of each future request. Decisions under perfect information 
(DUPI) are allocation decisions provided by a certain decision method, which takes advantage of the complete 
knowledge of all future arrival requests. This project utilizes two allocation decision methods when perfect 
information is available. Note again that such decision methods cannot be actually used in realistic 
environments and are merely utilized in our computation procedure. They are discussed as follows. 
(1) 0-1 knapsack problem formulation to make allocation decisions 
The objective of this project is to minimize the total shortage cost which is the sum of the shortage cost 
of all requests that are not fulfilled. Let T  be the total shortage cost of all requests; i.e., ∑
=
=
M
i
isT
1
. T  is the 
sum of the shortage costs of all rejected requests and that of all fulfilled requests. To minimize the shortage 
cost of all rejected requests is equivalent to maximize the shortage cost of all fulfilled requests.  
Therefore, we have the following knapsack problem formulation. 
Notations: 
iX : a binary decision variable. If request i  is fulfilled, 1iX = ; otherwise, 0iX = . [ ]0,1iX ∈ . 
Mi ,,3 ,2 ,1 K= . 
is : the shortage cost per unit quantity of the i -th request. Mi ,,3 ,2 ,1 K= .

The objective (equation (1)) of this project is to minimize the total shortage cost of rejected requests or to 
maximize the total shortage cost of fulfilled requests. Constraint (2) is the capacity constraint that enforces the 
total quantity of fulfilled requests are less than or equal to on-hand inventory. Constraint (3) is binary

fulfilled and the remaining inventory is 1.0-(0.1+0.3+0.5) = 0.1. Then, since the remaining inventory of 0.1 is 
insufficient to fulfill any of the other requests, the procedure stops. The total shortage cost is 
( ) ( ) ( )0.2 0.7 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.19× + × + × = . The decision using the heuristic rule is not an optimal one and we 
call it as heuristic decision under perfect information (HDUPI). 
 
4.2.2 Decision tree 
For each class, both the number of the future requests between current time and arrival time of the new 
replenishment and the quantity of each request are unknown at present time, thus, they are modeled as random 
variables in our problem. Moreover, total shortage cost generated in the future is also unknown. Each time 
when a future request arrives, the fulfillment-or-rejection decision should be made by a certain decision model. 
Thus, the total shortage cost by rationing available inventory I  from current time t  to the arrival time of a 
new replenishment, given a decision procedure D , can be treated as a random variable, ( ) |tSC I D . This 
random variable depends on not only the current time t  and current available inventory I , but also the 
decision procedure D . 
Assume that a class j  request of quantity q  with unit shortage cost jc  arrives at current time t . A 
shortage cost qc j ×  will be incurred when this request is rejected. Total shortage cost under a 
fulfillment-or-rejection decision can be illustrated in the Figure 16. In the Figure 16, t−  denote the infinite 
small time earlier than current time t . When a class j  request arrives, if the warehouse fulfills this request, 
the quantity of remaining inventory is decreased by the request quantity q  and total shortage cost remains 
unchanged. Therefore, total shortage cost after fulfilling the current request is ( ) |tSC I q D− . On the other 
hand, if the warehouse rejects this request, the quantity of remaining inventory remains the same and total 
shortage cost is increased by shortage cost qc j ×  of the current request. Hence, total shortage cost after 
rejecting the current request can be represented by )(|)( qcDISC jt ×+ .

help the airline company make a decision. In their approach, the expected revenues under two the conditions 
of accepting the arrival customer and rejecting the arrival customer need to be calculated. These two expected 
revenues can be computed by constructing a scenario tree that represents all possible scenarios. The optimal 
decisions under each scenario can be obtained and the probability of each scenario can be computed by 
multiplying the probabilities of the numbers of all class customers in the scenario. Then, the expected 
revenues under the condition of accepting and rejecting the customer can be obtained. 
However, in the inventory rationing problem investigated by this project, the lead time L  is assumed to 
be a normal random variable with mean Lµ  and variance 2Lσ . Within time interval ],( Lt , the number of future 
arrivals of class j  requests, jtN , is a Poisson random variable with arrival rate jλ . The quantity Q  of 
each request is assumed as a normal random variable with mean Qµ  and variance 2Qσ . Since the quantity of 
each request is a continuous random variable, it is impossible to generate all possible scenarios and construct 
a scenario tree as the Hung and Chen’s (2009) approach. According to the law of large numbers, the average 
results obtained from a large number of trials should approximate the expected value of the whole population. 
Thus, this project estimates the expected value of DUPI by conducting simulation sampling rather than 
constructing a scenario tree. Given the known distribution of assumed random variables to generate a random 
sample scenario s , we can generate a random Poisson number of class j  requests, denoted as sju , and a 
random quantity of each request under scenario s , sd . Then, given the available inventory I , a minimized 
total shortage cost under scenario s  (perfect information is given), )(ISC s , can be obtained by an 
allocation decision method that could be either 0-1 knapsack problem formulation or the heuristic rule 
described in subsection 3.2.1. After generating S  random scenarios, the estimated expected shortage cost of 
DUPI can be obtained by computing DUPI under each random scenario and setting the probability of each 
random scenario equal to the reciprocal of the number of random scenarios, that is,

4.3. Computational experiments and analysis 
Under the assumptions described in section 3.1, methods that make dynamic inventory rationing decision 
and are used in this experiment include the first-come-first-served (briefly, FCFS in the following presentation) 
rule, the dynamic stochastic inventory rationing (DSIR) decision procedure, sampling expected cost gap with 
knapsack problem formulation (SECG_O) and sampling expected cost gap with heuristic rule (SECG_H). 
Each time a request arrives, the FCFS approach fulfills all arrival requests as long as there is sufficient 
inventory. The DSIR approach compares the probability that fulfilling the request is a correct decision with 
the probability that rejecting the request is a correct decision. The SECG approach, including SECG_O and 
the SECG_H, compares the expected shortage cost gap under DUPI for an arrival request. This section 
presents the computational experiments to compare the above approaches. 
The computer programs are coded in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and ILOG CPLEX 7.1. A personal 
computer equipped with Intel core 2 Duo CPU 2.93 GHz and 4Giga Bytes RAM is used to run the 
experiments. 
 
4.3.1. Experiments design 
We simulate inventory rationing problems with three classes of requests. Each random problem contains 
a constant lead time and a set of random requests that arrive at different times during the lead time. The 
following constant parameters are used to generate random problems. 
1. The number of classes is 3 ( J ). 
2. The mean of the normal distribution of lead time is 50 ( Lµ ). 
3. The mean of quantity for an arrival request is 1 ( Qµ ). 
4. Unit shortage cost of class 2 is 1000 ( 2c ). 
Moreover, the random problems are generated under various conditions characterized by the following 
five control factors, as shown in Table 17.  
(1) Arrival rates (α ) 
Arrival rates (α ) are a set of values that represents the expected arrival rate for each class. For example, 
(1.5, 1.0, 0.5) represent that the arrival rates for classes 1, 2, and 3 are 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5, respectively. 
 53
Thus, there are total 5625 (1875 3 5625)× =  random problems are simulated under each of the four 
approaches.

Shortage cost slope (γ ) 5 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 
Standard deviation of request quantity ( Qσ ) 5 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 
Standard deviation of lead time ( Lσ ) 5 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 
  
4.3.2. Comparisons 
Since, for each random problem, the optimal shortage cost can be obtained by ODUPI, thus, the 
decisions given by ODUPI are used as a base for measuring the effectives of the other four approaches. The 
difference in shortage cost between an approach and ODUPI is used to measure the performance of the 
approach. However, in order to compare the performances under different problem conditions, the cost 
difference has to be normalized. The shortage cost calculated by ODUPI might be zero; thus, the cost 
difference cannot be normalized by being divided by the shortage cost of ODUPI. In the following, the cost 
difference will be divided by the total shortage cost of all fulfilled requests calculated by ODUPI. That is, 
ODUPIfor  requests fulfilled all ofcost  shortage  theof sum the
ODUPI ofcost  shortage -approach an  ofcost  shortagegapcost  normalized = . 
Total shortage cost of all requests in a random problem is equal to the sum of the shortage costs of all 
rejected requests and that of all fulfilled requests. To minimize the shortage cost of all rejected requests is 
equivalent to maximize the shortage cost of all fulfilled request. Therefore, by treating the shortage cost of a 
request as the revenue of the request, the normalized cost gap is equal to the normalized revenue gap as used 
in Hung and Chen (2009). 
Table 18 shows the result of the average normalized cost gaps of the 5625 random problems for the four 
approaches by Duncan test and the value of alpha is 0.05. Table 18 is divided into three distinct subsets. The 
best subset is the SECG_O and SECG_H and the worst subset is the FCFS. The performance of the SECG_O 
outperforms the other three approaches and the average normalized cost gap is 0.791%. Based on average 
 55
0.39% and 0.41%, respectively. Whereas, FCFS has larger variations among different arrival rate ratios and 
the largest difference in gap is 2.05%.

Figure 19. Average normalized cost gap for a variety of arrival rates 
 
Figure 20 shows that the average normalized cost gaps of SECG_O, SECG_H and FCFS decrease as the 
supply/demand ratio increases. The lower supply/demand ratio means that there is less available inventory 
during lead time; then, the warehouse has fewer chances to fulfill arrival requests. Therefore, it is more 
difficult to make allocation decision when the supply/demand ratio is low. From Figure 20, we observe that 
SECG_O and SECG_H have the smaller gaps among different supply/demand ratios. The largest differences 
of SECG_O and SECG_H in gap among different supply/demand ratios are about 1.3%. SECG_O and 
SECG_H outperform the other methods, especially when the supply/demand ratio is low.

  Given the known parameters, a random problem is generated. By simulating SECG approach with 90 
initial available inventory in the random problem, we obtain one random sample of SECGDSC =|)90(0 . 
Similarly, we simulate again to obtain another random sample of SECGDSC =|)89(0 . Then, we can obtain a 
random sample of SECGDG =|)90(0  by calculating the difference between the two random samples, 
SECGDSC =|)90(0  and SECGDSC =|)89(0 . In the experiment, a total of 100 random problems are 
generated and 100 samples of SECGDG =|)90(0 . The DUPI approach is an allocation decision provided by 
a certain decision method; that is, we know the complete information of all future requests when we make a 
decision. . However, due to the difficulty of generating all possible scenarios, we use random samplings to 
estimate the expected value of DUPI, as discussed in subsection 3.2.3. Given 90 initial available inventory, 
[ ]DUPIDSCE =|)90(0  can be estimated by the mean of the random sample. Similarly, we can obtain the 
estimation of [ ]DUPIDSCE =|)89(0 . Then, since the relation between the three random variables 
is ( ) ( ) ( )DUPIDSCDUPIDSCDUPIDG =−=== |)89(|)90(|)90( 000 , [ ]DUPIDGE =|)90(0  is obtain 
by calculating the difference between [ ]DUPIDSCE =|)90(0  and [ ]DUPIDSCE =|)89(0 . Now, we have 
100 samples values for SECGDG =|)90(0  and a value for [ ]DUPIDGE =|)90(0 . Therefore, one sample 
t-test is used to examine whether the mean of 100 samples for SECGDG =|)90(0  differs from a 
hypothesized value for [ ]DUPIDGE =|)90(0 . 
Two allocation decision methods - knapsack problem formulation and the heuristic rule – can be used for 
making decisions under perfect information in the SECG procedure proposed in this project. Therefore, we 
use one sample t-test to test whether the mean of 100 samples for OSECGDG _|)90(0 =  significantly 
differs from [ ]ODUPIDGE =|)90(0 . Also, one sample t-test is used to test whether the mean of 100 samples

5. Conclusion 
Considering various stochastic factors, such as the arrival of customers, request quantity of each 
customer, and the length of replenishment lead time, of an inventory system that fulfills a discrete number of 
classes, this project investigate inventory rationing decision procedures. Each time a request arrives, managers 
must determine whether to fulfill or to reject immediately. We consider two types of problem environments in 
this project. The first environment is that there is a clear classification among customer requests, that is, 
requests are categorized into multiple priority classes. We prefer to fulfill the higher priority requests than 
lower priority requests. The second condition is that requests are categorized into multiple classes according 
to different shortage costs. The objective of inventory rationing is minimizing total shortage cost. 
This project develops two inventory rationing approaches, dynamic stochastic inventory rationing 
decision procedure (DSIR) and risk level inventory rationing decision procedure (RLIR), for solving the first 
condition. The simulation results show that, in both the case of constant lead time and constant request and the 
case of random lead time and random request, risk level inventory rationing decision procedure (RLIR) can 
raise the fill rate of the highest priority request more aggressively than other approaches but it also sacrifices 
overall fulfillment. On the other hand, if managers want to raise the fill rate of high priority requests and still 
maintain high overall fill rate, the managers should use dynamic stochastic inventory rationing decision 
procedure (DSIR). Unlike previous studies that can handle only two priority classes, the proposed approaches 
can be used in inventory systems in which there are more than two priority classes. Also, the proposed 
approaches can employ to inventory systems with uncertain lead time and uncertain future requests. 
Furthermore, under the same conditions as previous approach (constant lead time and constant request), our 
approaches also perform well than previous approach. The methodology proposed in this study can be used 
when total expected requests in an uncertain replenishment lead time is greater than current on-hand inventory, 
especially when some major unexpected events in supply chain has disrupt the supply of inventory. 
For solving the problems in the second environment, this study proposes a decision procedure, sampling 
expected cost gap decision procedure (SECG), for the inventory management. In order to reduce total 
shortage cost, we may reject an early request with lower shortage cost and reserve the inventory for future 
requests with higher shortage cost. When a request arrives, the comutation of SECG is executed. In SECG, 
two allocation methods are proposed. One is knapsack problem formulation used to obtain an optimal solution
