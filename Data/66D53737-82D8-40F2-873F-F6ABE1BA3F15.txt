由於行動電話和無線網路的廣泛使用，以印刷電路板製作之微波電路也越來越普遍。要
獲得微波電路之 S 參數，通常需使用向量網路分析儀，因此必須使用轉接器將網路分析儀
與電路板連接。當頻率越高，轉換器的效能變得越差並會影響測量的結果。為能測得線路
的真正特性，必須使用 TRL 校正技術。經由測量穿透、反射和線性校正線路所得資料，即
可有效算出測試中電路的的真正 S 參數。然而，TRL 技術的公式存有一項先天的基本限制：
那就是兩個連接埠必須是相同的。因此像是阻抗轉換器和微帶線至共平面波導轉接是無法
藉由 TRL 技術導出的。要克服這項限制，我們提出一經改良後的 TRL 程序，以測量擁有
非對稱連接埠的雙埠微波電路。此項技術的特點是針對非對稱雙埠之兩個不同連接埠，重

（二）計畫英文摘要。（五百字以內） 
The wide-spread use of mobile phones and wireless data network, microwave circuits fabricated 
on printed circuit board (PCB) are getting more and more popular. To measure the S-parameters 
of the microwave circuits on PCB, vector network analyzer (VNA) are always used. Adapters are 
required to connect VNAs to these PCBs. As frequency gets higher, the adapter’s performance 
gets worse and affects the measurement result. To measure the real characteristics of the circuit, 
TRL calibration technique is proposed. It can effectively compute the true S-parameters of the 
device under test (DUT) from the measure data of the thru, reflect and line calibration circuits. 
However, there is one fundamental limitation inherent in the formulation of TRL technique. That 
is, the two ports must be the same. Devices such as impedance transformers and 
microstrip-to-CPW transitions can never be derived by TRL technique. To overcome this 
limitation, in this proposal we present a modified TRL procedure that can measure asymmetrical 
2-port devices. This technique features the use of the original TRL technique two times on two 
sets of calibration kits of the two different ports. Then, from the derived error matrices, the true 
S-parameters of the asymmetrical 2-port devices can be computed. Detailed formulation of the 
original TRL technique is derived. The modified TRL procedure for asymmetrical 2-port devices 
is presented. A 4-th order Chebyshev impedance transformer and a cavity-coupled microstrip 
impedance transformer are built and measured by this procedure. Good agreement between 
full-wave simulated and measured results is reached. This proves the feasibility and correctness 
of our proposed procedure and formulation. Using the result of the TRL formulation, a 
measurement procedure for symmetrical 3-port devices are also presented. The formulation has 
been verified by circuit simulation. However, full-wave simulation shows great discrepancy at 
higher frequency. The exact cause is still under investigation. 
 
 
2number-port devices. However, to measure N modes or 2N ports, a 2N-port network analyzer is
required which is a luxury for most researches. Or, a 2-port network analyzer can be used to
measure 2 ports at a time with the remaining ports terminated by 50-  loads. However, this will
lead to errors caused by the non-ideal characteristics of a real 50-  loads.
Even with the aforementioned improvement of TRL technique, the fundamental limitation
inherent in the TRL formulation still remains. That is, for a 2-port device, the characteristic
impedances of the two  ports must be the same. Therefore, due to the limitation of VNAs and TRL
technique, the S-parameters of a 2-port device with different ports such as impedance transformers
or microstrip-to-CPW transitions, can not be measured directly. Another limitation is measuring 3-
port and 4-port devices in planar circuits by 2-port network analyzers which are the most common
and affordable among research communities. 3-port devices such as power dividers or T-junctions
and 4-port devices such as directional couplers are common devices in microwave circuits. To
measure their S-parameters by 2-port network analyzers, it is necessary to connect extra ports by
coaxial 50-  loads. However, this 50-  loads do not work ideally at higher frequencies. To make
things worse, the connectors between the 50-  loads and planar circuits also have the same
problem.
In view of the TRL formulation, we found that a two-port device with different port
impedances can be modeled as an error box in the TRL process. Therefore, we present a modified
TRL procedure that can measure impedance transformers. This technique features the use of the
original TRL technique in two steps on two sets of calibration kits for the two different ports. Then,
from the derived error matrices, the true S-parameters of the asymmetrical 2-port devices can be
computed. Similar technique has been used in measuring coaxial-to-waveguide [10] and coaxial-to-
balanced line transitions [11]. The formulation of TRL calibration will be derived in Section II. The
procedure of asymmetrical 2-port measurement will be given in Section III. Experiment results are
also given. We also propose a process to measure symmetrical reciprocal 3-port devices utilizing
2-port TRL calibration without using 50-  loads. The detail will be given in Section IV.  Finally,
conclusion and evaluation are given in Section V.
II. Formulation of TRL Calibration
To be able to proceed to the procedure for asymmetrical 2-port measurement, detailed
formulation of the original TRL calibration is needed. Figure 1 shows the configuration of the
measurement setup. At the center is the DUT. The errors between the true measured data are
modeled as error box A and B with S-parameters  and , respectively. Note that the definition
of port 1 and 2 of  is in the opposite side of  such that symmetry of A and B in the following
formulation are retained. Unlike in [3] which assume ,  and , no assumption
is made to  and . Figure 2 shows the configurations of the TRL calibration setup. The thru
section is a direct connection of the two reference planes of the DUT. The reflect section is two high
reflection loads which usually are open or short circuits. The coupling between the two load must
be very small to be negligible safely. Let  be the reflection coefficients of the two loads.
The line section is a transmission line of suitable length connecting the two reference planes. The
line must be the same type of line as the one connecting to the DUT. According to [4], the optimum
length is quarter guided wavelength at the center of the measurement frequency band. Since there

III. Procedure of TRL Calibration of Asymmetrical 2-port Devices
Assume a 2-port device with different port structure types  and  as shown in Figure 3. 
First, perform TRL calibration to . Let the error boxes be  and . Next, perform TRL
calibration to  including the device as shown in Figure 4. Let the error boxes be  and .

A second example is a cavity-coupled microstrip impedance transformer as shown in Fig.
7. The structure consists of two substrates with different microstrip lines on them. One is a 
while the other is . Coupling between the two microstrip lines is accomplished by the opening
on their common ground. This structure can achieve very high bandwidth. The example here is
design to covers the UWB bandwidth, 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. The measured insertion loss is shown
in Fig. 8. Again, the difference of our technique and the simulated results are very small except a
jump in our measured result near 11 GHz. Fig. 9 shows the measured and simulated group delays.
Again, the measured result matches the simulated result except near the end of the passband.
Overall, the measured and simulated results are matched and in quite good agreement.
IV. Procedure of Measuring Symmetrical Reciprocal 3-port Devices Utilizing 2-
port TRL Calibration
Since network analyzers have only two ports. It is not possible to measure the S-parameters
of a 3-port device directly. Usually, one of the ports has to be terminated to a match load via coaxial
adapter. Therefore, the imperfect characteristics of the adapter and the match load itself at higher
frequency causes the measured result unreliable. A measurement technique for 3-port device that
can avoid the undesired effect of the adapters is needed.
Assuming all 3 ports of the 3-port device have the same characteristic impedance, Fig. 10
shows the setup of the calibration procedure. By terminating port 2 and 3 with the reflect load used
in standard 2-port TRL calibration, two sets  of calibrated S-parameters  and  are derived and
6 equations can be formulated. At the beginning, we though since the number of the unknowns of
a reciprocal 3-port device are only 6, this 6 equations should be enough to determine the S-
parameters. However, after exhaustive trial, it appeared that the 6 equations were not completely
independent. Therefore, another assumption is made to reduce the number of the unknowns. We
assume that port 1 and 2 are symmetrical, that is,   and . This limitation does not
pose great inconvenience since many 3-port devices satisfy this criteria, for instance, Wilkinson
power dividers and T-junctions. Now, the total number of unknowns is only 4, so the following 5

V. Conclusion and Evaluation 
In the original proposal, our goals are to develop measurement techniques for asymmetrical
2-port and 3-port devices by 2-port network analyzers. The first goal is successfully accomplished,
however, the second goal is not completed yet. To sum up,
1. The asymmetric 2-port TRL calibration has been successfully implemented to
measure a 4-th order Chebysheve transformer and a cavity-coupled microstrip
impedance transformer. Measured result shows good agreement with simulation.
2. Formulation of measuring symmetrical reciprocal 3-port devices utilizing 2-port
TRL calibration is developed and implemented. Even though the formulation has
been verified by circuit simulation, full-wave simulation results of a microstrip T-
junction are not in good agreement at higher frequency. The exact cause of this
discrepancy needs to be investigated further in the second year. Also, a general 3-
port formulation will be developed too in the second year.

A Novel Tri-band Dual-port Coplanar Waveguide-Fed Slot Loop Antenna

Introduction 
 
Current design trend of integrating wireless communication devices into one package has 
created great demand for multi-band antennas. For instance, a next generation notebook 
computer may have built-in local and wide area network connectivity via 802.11a/b/g and 
WiMAX wireless technologies. To support these operations, antennas must cover 2.4–2.4835 
GHz band for 802.11/b/g, 5.15–5.825 GHz band for 802.11a, and the popular 3.4-3.7 GHz 
band for WiMAX. To save cost and space, an antenna capable of operating in at least three 
frequency bands is required. 
 
One good candidate for these antennas is the printed CPW-fed slot loop antenna which 
provides the benefits of good impedance matching, omnidirectional patterns and wider 
bandwidth, on top of the usual benefits of printed circuit technology, i. e., low cost, 
compactness and ease of fabrication. Comparing to microstripline, the CPW has the 
advantages of easy integration of passive and active components, less coupling between 
adjacent components, lower radiation loss and no via hole to effect circuit characteristics at 
higher frequencies. Since the slot loop antenna and the CPW feedline reside on the same 
metallic layer, fabrication process is also simpler. 
 
Several types of multi-band slot antennas have been presented in the recent literature, 
including the multi-rectangular slot with short-end matching [1], the annular-ring slot 
antennas with open-end matching [2,3], and the slot antennas with T-stub matching [4,5]. 
Although these antennas satisfy sufficient impendence bandwidth and omnidirectional 
patterns, they occupy larger areas. Another disadvantage of these antennas is that all 
frequency bands share the same input/output port. This might not be practical in real world 
application because, for instance, 802.11a/b/g and WiMAX signals are handled by different 
chip sets.  
 
In this paper, a novel tri-band dual-port coplanar waveguide-fed slot loop antenna operating 
in the 802.11a/b/g and the 3.5 GHz WiMAX bands is presented. The antenna is consistent of 
two slot antennas each manufactured on the different sides of a circuit board. One antenna 
covers the 802.11a/b/g bands and the other 3.5 GHz WiMAX band. Each antenna has its own 
input/output port. Shorted metal in the slots and embedding lump elements are also 
implemented to reduce the size of the antenna. 
 
Antenna design 
 
Fig. 1 shows the configuration of the proposed tri-band antenna and the photograph of the 
fabricated antenna. The antenna is designed on a FR4 PCB substrate with dielectric constant 
εr = 4.3, loss tangent tanδ= 0.02 and thickness h = 1.6 mm. A 50 Ω CPW transmission line 
with strip width W = 4.8 mm and gap S = 0.4 mm is employed to feed the antenna. For a 
traditional slot loop antenna, the radiation is caused by the magnetic current resonating on the 
slot line. Therefore, we assume that the central part of the antenna has little effect on the

多年的革命情感。雖然畢業後各奔東西，少有聯繫，然而每在國際研討會上碰面

不佩服人類的韌性。

第五天早上是我最期待的大師講座。第一位是 Tatsuo Itoh，他的題目是
“Recent advances in composite right/left hand metamaterial structures”。他是這個領

新的東西不多。 而他的英文實在不好，再加上內容枯燥，為當日掌聲最少的演
講。然而這仍無損他的學術地位。第二位則是碩果僅存的華裔電磁領域大師 K. K. 
Mei。他們雖然已經退休，仍然孜孜不倦的推導複雜的公式，專研理論，實在令
人欽佩。他的演講題目為“On the development of Maxwellian circuits”。他企圖根

Introduction 
 
Current design trend of integrating wireless communication devices into one package has 
created great demand for multi-band antennas. For instance, a next generation notebook 
computer may have built-in local and wide area network connectivity via 802.11a/b/g and 
WiMAX wireless technologies. To support these operations, antennas must cover 2.4–2.4835 
GHz band for 802.11/b/g, 5.15–5.825 GHz band for 802.11a, and the popular 3.4-3.7 GHz 
band for WiMAX. To save cost and space, an antenna capable of operating in at least three 
frequency bands is required. 
 
One good candidate for these antennas is the printed CPW-fed slot loop antenna which 
provides the benefits of good impedance matching, omnidirectional patterns and wider 
bandwidth, on top of the usual benefits of printed circuit technology, i. e., low cost, 
compactness and ease of fabrication. Comparing to microstripline, the CPW has the 
advantages of easy integration of passive and active components, less coupling between 
adjacent components, lower radiation loss and no via hole to effect circuit characteristics at 
higher frequencies. Since the slot loop antenna and the CPW feedline reside on the same 
metallic layer, fabrication process is also simpler. 
 
Several types of multi-band slot antennas have been presented in the recent literature, 
including the multi-rectangular slot with short-end matching [1], the annular-ring slot 
antennas with open-end matching [2,3], and the slot antennas with T-stub matching [4,5]. 
Although these antennas satisfy sufficient impendence bandwidth and omnidirectional 
patterns, they occupy larger areas. Another disadvantage of these antennas is that all 
frequency bands share the same input/output port. This might not be practical in real world 
application because, for instance, 802.11a/b/g and WiMAX signals are handled by different 
chip sets.  
 
In this paper, a novel tri-band dual-port coplanar waveguide-fed slot loop antenna operating 
in the 802.11a/b/g and the 3.5 GHz WiMAX bands is presented. The antenna is consistent of 
two slot antennas each manufactured on the different sides of a circuit board. One antenna 
covers the 802.11a/b/g bands and the other 3.5 GHz WiMAX band. Each antenna has its own 
input/output port. Shorted metal in the slots and embedding lump elements are also 
implemented to reduce the size of the antenna. 
 
Antenna design 
 
Fig. 1 shows the configuration of the proposed tri-band antenna and the photograph of the 
fabricated antenna. The antenna is designed on a FR4 PCB substrate with dielectric constant 
εr = 4.3, loss tangent tanδ= 0.02 and thickness h = 1.6 mm. A 50 Ω CPW transmission line 
with strip width W = 4.8 mm and gap S = 0.4 mm is employed to feed the antenna. For a 
traditional slot loop antenna, the radiation is caused by the magnetic current resonating on the 
slot line. Therefore, we assume that the central part of the antenna has little effect on the
