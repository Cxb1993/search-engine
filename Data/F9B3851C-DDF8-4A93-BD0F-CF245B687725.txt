2.1 Introduction 
We study the three-dimensional effect of 
nonnormality, autocorrelation, and estimation on the 
performance of X  charts with estimated symmetric 
control limits, assuming that the control limits are set 
as if the sample means }{ iX  were independent and 
identically distributed (iid) normal.  Traditional 
Shewhart control charts are appropriate 
statistical-process-control (SPC) tools for determining 
whether a process appears to be in or out of control.  
For example, the X  chart is useful for detecting 
changes in the process mean, while R and S charts are 
useful for detecting changes in the process variance.  
This project considers only the X  chart, but the 
results can be extended to R and S charts with careful 
interpretations.     
Suppose that a set of n quality measurements {X1, 
X2,..., Xn} is taken at a regular interval of time from the 
data process and the sample mean  ni i nXX 1 /   is 
computed for each data set.  The X  control-chart 
procedure analyzes a sequence of sample means 
,..., 21 XX  for detecting the mean shift away from the 
target value, say 0 .  An out-of-control signal is sent 
when the first sample mean, say NX , lies outside the 
control limits; and appropriate actions are taken to 
bring the process back to the in-control state.  This 
project considers only the case of symmetric control 
limits, which can be denoted as Xk 0  for any 
fixed value of n, where k is a positive constant and 
X  is the standard deviation of X .    
The performance of the control chart is usually 
measured by the statistical properties of the random run 
length N = }|:|inf{ 0 Xi kXi   .  Common 
performance measures include the average run length 
(ARL, i.e., E(N)), the standard deviation and 
percentiles of N, and the probability that N exceeds a 
certain value.  For example, when the process is in 
control with mean 0 , the ARL (called the in-control 
ARL and denoted ARL0) is preferred to be large, 
indicating lower frequency of false alarms; when the 
process is out of control with the mean shifted away 
from 0 , the ARL  (called the out-of-control ARL) 
is preferred to be small, indicating higher power in 
detecting the mean shift. 
A typical assumption on X  charts is that the 
sample means ,..., 21 XX  are independent and 
identically distributed (iid) as a normal distribution.  
Such an assumption may not be valid in practice.  
Examples of nonnormal data can be found, e.g., in 
Montgomery (2005), Figures 7-9 and 7-10, and 
examples of autocorrelated data, e.g., in Pandit and Wu 
(1983).  Furthermore, the in-control process mean 
0  and/or the variance of the sample mean X  may 
be unknown and hence, the control limits need to be 
estimated based on a set of Phase-I data.  In any case, 
the effects of nonnormality, autocorrelation, and 
estimation can cause the control-chart performance to 
stray away from the specified level.  
We study the three-dimensional effect of 
nonnormality, autocorrelation, and estimation on the 
performance of X  charts with estimated symmetric 
control limits, assuming that the control limits are set 
as if the sample means iX  were iid normal.  Special 
cases of independence and known control limits are 
also discussed.  Other assumptions include: (i) the 
2 
 standardized Gaussian AR(p) process {Zi}: Ti = 
))((1 iT ZF  , where )(  and )(TF  are the 
cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) of the 
standard-normal and T random variables, respectively.  
We choose the ARTA(p) implementation because it 
allows for the specification of the marginal distribution 
and autocorrelations p ,...,1  of the first p lags to be 
arbitrary, provided that certain restrictions on the 
autocorrelations are observed (Chen, 2001).  When 
the autocorrelations 0j  for j = 1, …, p, the 
ARTA(p) process is simply a sequence of iid random 
variables Ti. 
Furthermore, we choose the Johnson family 
(which includes normal, lognormal, bounded, and 
unbounded types of distributions) because it covers the 
entire feasible part of the (β1, β2) plane, where β1 is the 
squared skewness and β2 is the kurtosis.  For each 
point (β1, β2), there is one corresponding Johnson 
distribution.  For instance, all lognormal (β1, β2) 
values fall on a single curve; the region above the 
lognormal curve consists of bounded Johnson 
distributions, denoted by SB; the region below consists 
of unbounded Johnson distributions, denoted by SU 
(Johnson et al. 1994). 
Our robustness study for investigating the effects 
of nonnormality, autocorrelation, and estimation will 
be conducted under three cases:  (i) The sample 
means }{ iX  are iid with known X , (ii) }{ iX  are 
iid with unknown X , (iii) }{ iX  follow an ARTA(1) 
process.  When X  needs to be estimated from the 
Phase-I observations },...,{ 1 mYY  of X , we use a 
common estimate 2/1

2.4 Results 
 
(1) Nonnormality effect 
First, we consider the situation of iid Johnson SB 
data with m=∞, i.e., X  is known.  We compute the 
ARL as a function of skewness )(3 X  and kurtosis 
)(2 X , assuming that the sample means }{ iX  are iid 
as the Johnson SB bounded distributions with a known 
variance 2X .   
For this special case, the X -chart control limits 
Xk 0  can be computed exactly for any given 
value of k and hence, the Phase-I estimation step is 
unnecessary.  Let N  denote the run length of the 
X  chart when the process mean E(X) shifts from μ0 to 
μ1 = X 0 .  (Note that δ = X /)( 01   is 
unit-free.)  Because the observations of X  are 
assumed independent, N  follows a geometric 
distribution with mean p/1ARL   and standard 
deviation pp /1N  , where 
}{ 0 XkXPp   .  For example, if X  has a 
normal distribution and the shift δ= 0, the in-control 
ARL is ARL0 = [2Φ(-3)]-1 = 370, where )(  is the 
standard-normal cdf.  Here we consider only ARL , 
not  N , because for k=3, p is small and 
 N ARL .   
Here we investigate nonnormality effect. Figures 1 
to 2 illustrate ARL  as a function of the kurtosis only, 
skewness only, and both skewness and kurtosis, 
respectively.  In Figure 1, the ARL  curves for the 
Johnson distribution with skewness 0, kurtosis )(2 X  
= 3 to 50, and shift δ = 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 are plotted.  
For skewness 0, the Johnson distribution types with 
kurtosis less than, equal to, and larger than 3 are the 
bounded SB, normal, and unbounded SU, respectively.  
Although any 1)(2 X  is feasible, we consider only 
3)(2 X  to exclude the Johnson bounded 
distributions.  Furthermore, only positive δ values are 
considered since ARL  = ARL  for symmetric 
distributions.

for symmetric Johnson data with )(2 X  = 3 to 50 and shift δ = 0, 0.5, 1, 
and 1.5 
 
Figure 1 suggests two results.  First, for small δ 
(e.g., 1 ), the ARL value is extremely, moderately, 
and least sensitive to the change of the kurtosis 
)(2 X  for 4)(2 X , ]10,4()(2 X , and 
10)(2 X , respectively.  (Note that the distribution 
shapes with ]4,1[)(2 X  are widely different; as 
4 
 sufficient, to obtain an LRˆA  close to that for m=∞.  
For distributions where the kurtosis is at least 5, m = 
100 observations of the Phase-I X  data seems 
enough to obtain a good approximation of the ARL  
with known control limits (i.e., m = ∞).   On the other 
hand, the decrease in  Nˆ  is significant as m 
increases from 100 to 500.  To obtain an X -chart 
performance with a less variable run length, m = 500 is 
preferred for all cases.    
 
(3) Autocorrelation effect 
Here we investigate the distribution of the 
in-control run length for AR(1) processes: the process 
of sample mean iX  is denoted as 
)( 0iX = iiX   )( 01 , where μ0 is the 
in-control mean,   is the lag-1 autocorrelation, 
1||  , and i  independently follows a normal 
distribution with mean 0 and variance 2 . 
There are three results. (1) The probability 
}1{ 0 NP  (where N0 is the in-control run length) is 
the same for all 1||  . (Note that this result is also 
true even if the marginal distribution is not normal 
distribution.) (2) As ||  increases, }2{ 0 NP  
decreases. (3) The distribution of N0 is close to a 
geometric distribution with the probability of success 
equal to the reciprocal of 0ARL .  
We explain these results in turn.  The first result 
is true because 
)3(1}3{}1{ 0010 XX FXPNP  
)3( 0 XF   , where F is the cdf of X .  For the 
second result,

where )1/( 222   X .  Figure 3 shows the values 
of }2{ 0 NP  for AR(1) processes with 99.00   .  
Figure 3 shows that }2{ 0 NP  decreases as ||  
increases. 
Figure 4 shows the probability mass function of N0 
for }9.0 ,7.0 ,5.0 ,0{ .  Here, }1{ 0 NP  is 0.0027 
for }9.0 ,7.0 ,5.0 ,0{ .  For 0 , the values of 
}2{ 0 NP  is computed numerically using Equation 
(1), and }{ 0 iNP  , 10003  i  are estimated by 
simulation experiments.

Figure 4: The probability distribution of N0 for AR(1) 
processes with }9.0,7.0,5.0,0{  
For the third result, we compare the distribution of 
N0 with the geometric distribution with the same value 
of ARL0.  When 0 , the distribution of N0 is 
geometric.  When ||  increases, the distribution of 
N0 deviates from the geometric distribution more 
heavily.  So we choose the case of 9.0  for 
discussion here.  Figure 5 shows the distribution of N0 
and the geometric distribution with the same value of 
ARL0 for AR(1) process with 9.0 .  We define 
the absolute value of the relative error || iE  between 
}{ 0 iNP   and the probability of the geometric 
distribution, i=1, 2, ..., ∞, and the iE  is [ }{ 0 iNP   - 
the probability of the geometric distribution]/(the 
probability of the geometric distribution).  The values 
of || 1E , || 2E , || 3E , and || 4E  are 124%, 23%, 
12%, and 7%, respectively.  The values of || iE , 
5i , are lower than 7%.  When the absolute value of 
the lag-1 autocorrelation ||  gets smaller, the 
absolute relative error decreases.  Hence, the 
distribution of N0 is close to a geometric distribution 
especially the tail probabilities.   
6 
 quality measurements are independent and with a 
known marginal distribution. However, in practice the 
measurements may be autocorrelated to cause too 
many false alarms or defects.  Furthermore, the data 
process may be unknown.  Hence, in this research, we 
that the quality characteristic measurements X’s are 
autocorrelated time series data and the data process is 
unknown, but a set of Phase-I data is given. 
3.3 The Proposed Method 
Here we discuss the joint economic design for the 
X  and R control charts. That is, find the optimal 
values of the four design parameters: sample size n, 
time h between successive samples, control-limit factor 
k1 of X  chart, and control-limit factor k2 of R chart to 
minimize the expected hourly cost E(C)/E(T), where 
E(C) is the expected total cost and E(T) is the expected 
total length of a production cycle (Chen and Pao 2011). 
The framework of the proposed method is: 
 
Given a set of Phase-I 
data: {X1,…,XN}
Fit an ARTA(p) Process
Find an economic design 
of the     and R charts with 
the fitted ARTA(p) 
process: finding the 
optimal design parameter 
value of 
n, h ,k1, k2
X
 
We describe the method to fit an ARTA(p) process 
and the method to compute the optimal values of n, h, 
k1 and k2 in turns below.   
(1) Fitting an ARTA(p) process to the Phase-I data  
Given a set of Phase-I data  NXXX ,,, 21  , we 
can fit an ARTA(p) process as follows: 
(a) Compute the sample autocorrelations up to lag 
N-1.  Set p (p < N) as the value that the lag-h 
sample autocorrelations is less than 0.1 for h > p. 
(b) Fit an empirical distribution using the set of 
Phase-I data (see Bratley, Fox, and Schrage 1987).  
The fitted marginal distribution is piecewise 
constant with   NixF   for ii XxX 1 .   
(2) Computing the optimal values of n, h, k1 and k2 
Here we compute the optimal design parameter 
values of n, h, k1, k2.  Below is the flow chart of the 
computing procedure: 
Set the control limits for
  and R based on 
n, h ,k1, k2 
Estimate 
The in-control ARL (ARL0)
and out-of-control ARL (ARL1, 
ARL2, ARL3) for the joint 
design of       and R charts

First, we set the control limits based on a guess of 
the optimal n, k1, k2 and h. Then, estimate the associate 
average run length (ARL), compute the expected total 
cost E(C) and expected total length of a production 
cycle E(T), and finally compute the expected hourly 
cost E(C)/E(T).  We use the grid search method to 
find the minimum of E(C)/E(T). 
The cost model used to compute E(C) and E(T) is 
based on Chen and Pao (2011). Due to the page 
limitation, we refer the details to Chen and Pao (2011). 
3.4 Numerical Results 
First we run simulation experiments to study the 
effect of autocorrelations on the optimal value of (n, h, 
k1, k2).  The results are shown in the following table 
for an ARTA(1) process with autocorrelation  = 0, 0.5, 
the mean shift is =1 standard deviation and the 
variance shift 1.5 standard deviations. The results 
show that when the autocorrelation increases, the 
optimal values of n and h increase but not k1 and k2.

Abstract: 
 
This work applies CUSUM charts for detecting outbreaks of the 
respiratory syndrome. The data, daily ambulatory-care visits based on 
population of size 160 thousand, are from Taiwan National Health Insurance 
Research Database. We construct a standardized CUSUM chart based on 
residuals of a fitted regression model with an ARMA error term using the 
2005 and 2006 data. The CUSUM chart seems to be able to detect aberrations 
of respiratory syndrome when used to monitor the 2007 and 2008 data.

Abstract 
 
Model uncertainty arises in various contexts and is dealt with differently  
by each subculture.   The classic approach---to estimate model parameters  
and to treat those estimates as true values---has been criticized widely.   
We discuss eight examples: control charts with estimated control limits,  
the M/M/1 queue with estimated traffic intensity, portfolio optimization  
with estimated covariance matrix, confidence intervals for the mean,  
Bayesian statistics, the efforts of the simulation community during the past  
decade to combine modeling and sampling error, model selection in regression  
models, George Shanthikumar's operational statistics, and the St. Petersburg Paradox.   
Attempts to include model uncertainty can cause their own modeling issues, 
 for example when a mixture model is used to average over many models.   
A particular issue is that performance measures can unexpectedly be infinite.   
We advocate using the classical approach, supported by sensitivity analysis.
