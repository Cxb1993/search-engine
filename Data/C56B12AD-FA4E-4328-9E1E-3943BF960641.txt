Hand is one of the most major organs in human body and plays an important role in our 
daily living activities. Most prehensile functions of hand are the thumb-finger relationships, such 
as grip, grasp, pinch or similar manipulations. Loss of thumb or finger function resulting from 
different kinds of disorders has a devastating effect on hand function, even has further influences 
in our daily activities and occupational performances. 
Twisting activities such as jar turning and door opening are common functional activities in 
our daily living. However, it is a big challenge for the patients with arthritis or after hand injuries. 
Furthermore, there is little evidence of literature investigate this complicated activity. That is, 
there is no suitable method or model to measure the kinematics and kinetics of the hand during 
jar turning. The Motion Analysis Lab of Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Hand Surgery 
Laboratory, National Cheng Kung University has had excellent experiences and achievements in 
performing static and kinematics analysis of the hand and upper extremity. Therefore, we 
investigated biomechanical behavior of human hand while performing twisting activity. This 
model can provide an objective method to assess the precise kinematics and kinetics and predict 
the joint reaction and muscle/tendon force using a mathematical model. 
Three stages will be executed in this study. In the first study, a custom designed twisting 
device was designed and developed to measure the applied force of the thumb/index finger and 
total torque output while performing twisting activity using force/torque sensors. In the second 
part of the study, we investigated the individual contribution of thumb/index finger in jar opening 
from biomechanical point of view and the posture and coordination of thumb and fingers. It turns 
out to establish database of kinematics and kinetics from 20 normal subjects using the custom 
designed twisting device synchronized with computer-based motion analysis system.  In the 
third part, a biomechanical hand model was developed to calculate the joint reaction force and 
moment and predict the muscle forces for the thumb and index finger. 
In the future, it will be easily to extend the investigations to other kinds of functional 
activities based on this measurement method. The future goal and clinical application of this 
study will be to suggest appropriate treatment programs and to design suitable tools in our daily 
living and occupational uses to prevent cumulative and postoperative injuries.

INTRODUCTION 
Jar opening/closing activity requires complicated prehensile functions of the hand, and the 
activity is a common but challenging task in daily living for elder people. This twisting task 
needs not only powerful strength of the hand and wrist but also adequate range of motion to 
generate the sufficient torque. The thumb plays a very important role while performing most of 
the prehensile activities; as a result, the coordination of the thumb and fingers during performing 
twisting is important. There is no literature to study the individual contribution of the thumb and 
each finger to overall torque output. Therefore, we investigated the loads of the thumb and digits 
in jar opening and tried to develop an instrumented jar to measure the overall twisting torque and 
applied force and moment of each individual digit. 
 
PURPOSES OF THE STUDY 
The purpose of this study was set to measure the force and torque of the thumb in 
jar-opening task by a custom designed jar-like cylinder instrument. First, we developed an 
innovative device to simulate the twisting activity and measure the overall twisting torque and 
applied force and moment of the thumb/fingertip using one torque sensor and multi-axis 
force/torque sensors. Based on this study, we will be able to measure force and moment of thumb 
or index fingertip and the total twisting torque during the twisting activity. Second, we measured 
the kinematics and kinetics performances of normal subjects using the custom-design finger load 
measured device incorporating with the video-based motion analysis system. Main objectives 
included 1) observation of which position makes maximal force or torque during the activity, 2) 
analysis of the coordination of three thumb/index finger joints during performing twisting, and 3) 
ratio of the twisting torque of the thumb/index finger to overall torque output. Third, a 
three-dimensional biomechanical model describing the detail anatomical structure of the 
musculotendinous and joint complex of the hand was also be developed to calculate the resultant 
force and moment of the thumb/index finger joints and predict the muscle forces. Then, this 
model will be applied in twisting activity to investigate how much the force is generated by the 
muscle and how the musculoskeletal system keeps the balance and stable in thumb/finger joints. 
Besides, to discover the torque contribution of the thumb in female adults may also bring the 
research respect on the potential threat of cumulated trauma disorders in this complicated task.  
 
LITERATURE REVIEWS 
Jar opening activity is a common but challenging task in daily living for female adults. Many 
female adults had trouble in opening the jar with vacuum-sealed lid. The repetitive overload of 
the thumb in such task may cause a pollex tendon injury. For the patients receiving ligament 
reconstruction of the thumb, the jar opening was reported as the most difficult task to perform in 
their daily activity (Rayan & Young, 1997). Usually, in order to overcome the friction resistance 
of the vacuum-sealed lid, people tend to use the dominant hand to grasp the jar lid firmly and

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Experimental Apparatus 
A steel jar-like cylinder (66mm diameter; 84mm height) was customed to embrace two 
sensors inside to measure the force and torque generated by digits and wrist (Figure 1). One 
six-axis force transducer (Nano-25, ATI Industrial Automation, North Carolina, USA, Fx, Fy = 
±111N, Fz=±445N, Tx,Ty,Tz=±2.8N-m)) was mounted in the jar lid to detect the applied force of 
the thumb during turning movement. One single axis torque cell (TRT-200, Transducer 
Techniques, Temecula, CA, USA, torque range: ±22.6 Nm) was fitted inside the centre of the 
cylinder to record the overall torque generated by the hand and wrist. The signals of the force 
transducer were amplified and transmitted together with those of the torque cell simultaneously 
through an A/D converter (InstruNet-100, GW Instruments, Somerville, MA, USA) to a computer 
for recording and analysis. Unlike the regular jar lid, the edge of this lid was rather smooth 
without any design to promote the friction between thumb and the surface.

    Connect the force/torque sensor to the video-based motion analysis system to ensure that it 
is available to activate these two systems simultaneously: In conjunction with the measurement of 
the kinetic performance of the thumb, three-dimensional kinematic data acquired using a 
six-camera motion analysis system (Motion Analysis Corporation, California, USA). A small 
volume calibration frame will be used to calibrate the accuracy of the system. Eight 20 mm 
diameter retro-reflective markers are mounted on the calibration frame. Calibration residuals for 
this system are a measure of its accuracy in recording marker positions. Each motion data 
collection lasted for 5 seconds at a 60Hz sampling rate. The three-dimensional coordinates of the 
surface markers were registered and reconstructed. Three dorsal markers on the wrist were used 
to construct a local hand coordinate system, in which later data was referenced. A MATLAB® 
program was created to compute kinematical and kinetic data. 
 
Subjects and Procedures 
Eight female and two male healthy volunteer (mean ± SD: age, 27.2 ± 5.5 years; mass, 55.4 ± 
5.9 kg; height, 158.5 ± 5.2 cm; hand length, 18 ± 0.8 cm; hand width, 8.9 ± 0.4 cm) took part in

About the marker system for thumb in this study, thirteen 4 mm diameter retro-reflective 
markers were attached on the dorsal surface of the thumb to define the local coordination system 
of the thumb and three markers were on the jar simulator to define its coordination system 
(Figure 3). The 12th and 13th markers were use to define the IP joint center, and then would be 
removed in trial of opening jars.  
In every local coordination system of the thumb, the long axis(x) of every segment was 
defined as the unit vector form the distal marker to proximal marker of the “T” markers set. The 
dorsal axis(y) was defined as the unit vector of the cross product of the vector (from the distal 
marker to third marker of the “T” markers set) and the x axis. The radially directed axis(z) was 
the cross product of the x and y axis.

The subject was asked to sit in front of an experiment table and position the elbow joint in 
90 degree. Three-dimensional kinematic data was collected by using a six-camera motion 
analysis system (ExpertVisionTM 3D Motion Analysis system, USA) and the kinetic performance 
of the thumb was measured by the designed device (jar simulator). All the data were collected at

The value of az, Mr (radial component of moment M) and θ could be computed by the 
following equations. 
 a = [r sinθ, -r cosθ, az]Τ,   r = 33mm        (1)

 Mm = M + b × F           (5) 
Without tensile stress on the circumferential surface of the cylinder, the tangential and axial 
components of the applied moment M should be zero. The radial direction of the applied moment 
toward the origin was defined as positive. Then, M can be expressed in terms of Mr as 
 M = [-Mr sinθ, Mr cosθ, 0]Τ         (6) 
and Equation (5) can be simplified as a matrix form.

constraint forces(Cx, Cy, Cz) and two constraint moments(Mx, My). The MCP joint is regarded 
as a universal joint, and therefore has two degree of freedom with three constraint forces and one 
constraint moments (Figure 6). The CMC joint is as same as the MCP joint, is regarded as a 
universal joint.

We utilized the mechanical equilibrium ( 0, 0F MΣ = Σ =  at each joint) to solve the muscle 
and joint constraint forces. The six independent equations were derived for each thumb joint in 
the static state. Therefore there are total eighteen equilibrium equations at three joints but 21 
unknown forces and moments acting about each joint including 8 muscle forces and 13 joint 
constraint forces and moments (Table 2).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Interaction Forces between Thumb and the Jar Lid 
 The results of the applied forces of the thumb to the jar lid showed in Table 3. In those two 
activities, the normal forces applied by the thumb were average about 45N and the tangent forces 
were average about 15N. The twisting torque contribution of the thumb was average about 32.5%. 
Figure 7 and 8 showed the thumb forces and torque applied to the jar lid in power grip and 
precision handling. Table 4 was the external loading data, which the jar lid applied to the thumb, 
applied to the IP joint with respect to the distal phalanx axis system during the two activities. 
External moments tended to extend, adduct and internally rotate the IP joint.

Joint Constraint Forces and Moments 
About the results the joint constraint forces and moments of the thumb (Table 6), the external 
forces and the muscle forces were the major factors to influence the joint constraint forces and 
moments. At each articular surface, joint bore the contact forces (Cx) mainly. CMC joint bore the 
largest dorsal and lateral shear forces among three joint.

Comparisons of the Thumb Model 
We also compared our results to other thumb models of previous studies. Table 8 was the 
comparisons of the thumb model. Cooney et al. (1977) used the three-link model but Giurintano 
et al. (1995) used the five-link model to predict the muscle and joint loads of the thumb in ADLs. 
Giurintano et al. considered that the flexion-extension axis should not perpendicular to the 
abduction-adduction axis at the MCP and CMC joint. The biomechanical model of the thumb 
developed by Cooney et al. assumed that the extensor-muscle forces were excluded and that FPB 
and OPP acted as one force vector. Therefore, the muscle and joint loads of the thumb would be 
solved from a static determinate system. The moment arm of individual muscle was measured by 
Cooney et al. and Giurintano et al. from X-ray or CT images. In this study, the moment arm of 
muscles we used was measured by Smutz et al. It would cause the different moment arm of 
muscles because of the different measuring tools and then affected the muscle loads.
