prevents the wheels from locking while braking. The purpose of this is to allow the 
driver to maintain steering control under heavy braking and in most situations to 
shorten braking times. The friction force on a locked wheel is usually considerably 
less as it slides on the road. Furthermore, while the wheel is locked, steering becomes 
impossible, leading to loss of control of the vehicle. For these reasons, anti-lock 
braking systems (ABS) [7-9] have become one of the most commonly used 
automotive technologies. The most important process parameters affecting the quality 
of control are the coefficient of friction between wheel and road surface, the wheel 
slip ratio and wheel angular velocity. The optimal wheel slip ratio for most road 
surfaces is between 0.1 and 0.3. Most ABS control strategies [3], [4] aim at 
maintaining the wheel slip ratio at 0.2. This value is a compromise between achieving 
a maximum friction force during braking, acceleration and vehicle steering. However, 
in general, optimal slip ratios vary depending on different road surfaces, such as wet 
roads or icy roads. Forcing the wheel slip ratio to track optimal slip ratios, which 
causes the maximal tire/road friction force, can minimize the vehicle braking times. 
However, there are three main problems regarding the optimal slip ratios: First, if the 
road characteristics are unknown, how can the optimal slip ratio be found? Second, 
how does wheel angular velocity affect the optimal slip ratio? Third, what effect does 
road slop have? 
Typically, ABS controllers before have used design methods such as genetic 
neural control [11], fuzzy logic control [12], sliding mode control [13], and adaptive 
control [14]. Most controllers have assumed fixed road surface characteristics and a 
fixed reference slip ratio. But in general, optimal slip ratios depend on different road 
types. A tire/road friction estimator using only wheel angular velocity has been 
proposed to monitor road characteristics [2]. In [2], a LuGre model [5], [6], which 
effectively models tire/road friction based on the relative contact velocity, is used to

II. Quarter Vehicle Model 
In this section, we will design a dynamic equation of a quarter vehicle model, 
traveling the sloping road, and with an antilock brake system. The free body diagram 
for a quarter vehicle model is shown in Fig. 1. The wheel dynamic equation can be 
derived as follows: 
RFPKTTI xibtb −=−=ω&                         (1) 
where I  is the moment of inertia, bT  is the braking torque, tT  is driving torque, 
iP  is the braking pressure, ω  is the angular velocity of the wheel, bK  is the gain 
between bT  and iP , R  is the tire rolling radius, and xF is the longitudinal force.  
We now describe the braking operations. During braking, braking torque is 
applied to the wheel, and the wheel and vehicle speed decrease. As shown Fig.1, 
when the vehicle is moving at a constant speed, v , the differential equation of vehicle 
longitudinal dynamics can be written as: 
)sin(αqxq gmFmv −=&                        (2) 
where qm  is one quarter of the vehicle mass, xF is the longitudinal force, α  is the 
slope angle and g  is the acceleration of gravity.

force xF  is effective at road-surface level. That is it allows the driver to apply 
throttle and then brakes to accelerate and slow the vehicle. The normal force zF  is a 
function of the weight of the vehicle, or the component of the weight acting in a 
vertical plane relative to the road surface. The lateral force yF  controls its 
maneuverability and stability in changing the vehicle’s forward direction, but we will 
not consider it. The relationships among these are depicted in Fig. 2.

Thus, we suppose a control input u is

V. Overall Control System and Simulation Results 
Slip ratio control is a well-known method in ABS. In general, a given optimal slip 
ratio with respect to various road conditions is used as a reference signal. One main 
disadvantage of this method is the difficulty in getting the optimal slip ratio when the 
road conditions are unknown.  
Optimal slip ratios vary according to road surface, road slope and wheel angular 
velocity. The ABS with the LuGre friction model (LuGre-based ABS) proposed in 
this paper can recognize the road condition and then supply the corresponding 
reference slip ratio to the vehicle system through a mapping function. To monitor the 
road situation in the LuGre-based ABS, it is only necessary to have the wheel 
angular velocity ω , which is easily measured by actual sensors. When the slope 
angle changes, the optimal slip ratio will also change. The overall control system is 
shown in Fig. 8.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mapping function ),ˆ,( ωθαλ Md = is shown in Fig. 5. It maps the road 
condition parameterθ , the slope angle α and wheel angular velocity ω  to the 
reference slip ratio dλ . Neural networks are well-known nonlinear approximators [1], 
especially for function approximation. Thus, to quickly and accurately learn the

the reference slip, dλ . Figure 13 shows the control signal for the snowy road.  
The second simulation is of a wet road (θ  is 0.505) that slops down at a o20  
angle for 1.5 seconds, and slop angle becomes o0  after 1.5 seconds (i.e.,α  is from 
o20− to o0 ). The parameters relating to the road estimator are 6.0max =θ  and 
5105×=γ . Figure 14 shows the curve for the actual road condition θ  and the 
estimate θˆ . Figure 14 shows that the road estimator is effective by t= 0.6 seconds, 
and that the observer tracks the actual road condition. Figure 15 shows the curves of 
the vehicle speed (v) as it was reduced from 33.3 m/sec to 0 m/sec in 2.5517 seconds 
and the corresponding velocity of the wheel (ω ). Figure 16 shows the curves of the 
actual slip,λ , and the reference slip, dλ . At t=0.6 seconds, the actual slip, λ , tracks 
the reference slip dλ . Figure 17 shows the control signal for the wet road. The 
simulation results shown in Figs. 16–17 demonstrate that the proposed method is 
robust because the operation of the ABS is well when the slope angle changes after 
1.5 seconds. 
Finally, in our simulation, we compare the braking time for different slope angles. 
Table 2 shows braking time and distance for an automobile on a wet road (θ  is 
0.505). As expected, the braking time and distance decrease as the slop angle 
increases.

VI. Conclusion 
In this paper, we design a new method to estimate the optimal slip ratio using 
wheel rotational velocity and road slop information. This solves the traditional 
problem of slip ratio control when the road condition is unknown. The LuGre 
tire/road estimator is applied to estimate the road characteristics. If we want to 
know the road characteristics, the wheel angular velocity is the only signal we need 
to measure. We use a back-propagation learning algorithm to obtain a mapping 
function from road surface conditions, slope angle and wheel angular velocity to the 
optimum slip ratio. In anti-lock braking systems, certain states are difficult to obtain 
by real physical sensors, or are prone to noise and other measurement errors. To 
resolve this problem, the observer-based direct adaptive fuzzy-neural controller 
(DAFC) is applied to ABS control, and its stability is guaranteed. The simulation 
results show that the road estimator effectively and quickly captures the road 
conditions, and the DAFC can force the output to track the reference slip ratio 
obtained by the road estimator.

Abstract: - The purpose of this paper is to present an innovative method to record traffic accidents by using 
small remote-controlled robots as the distance-measuring devices. Bluetooth wireless modules are also 
combined for remote control and data communication. Unlike traditional methods using a ruler or measuring 
tape as a distance-measuring device, this technological development allows remote-controlled robots to perform 
rapid distance measurement. Thus, it is possible to provide valuable data for review of traffic accidents or 
identification of responsibility. This measuring system offers an easy and fast solution that can be used to 
measure irregular distances and calculate actual area with improved accuracy. 
 
Key-Words: - Remote-controlled robots, Distance measurement, Area measurement, Image recording. 
 
 
1   Introduction 
Typically, distance measurement methods are 
divided into contact and non-contact methods. 
Contact distance measurement often uses a straight 
scale, measuring tape or meter ruler [1]-[2], which 
must be controlled manually by the operator. 
However, it is not easy to measure distance along an 
irregular path, or measure an irregular area.  
 
Non-contact distance measurement is divided 
into “reflective” and “imaging” measurement. 
Conventional reflective methods comprise ultrasonic 
measurement [3]-[4] and laser measurement [5]-[6], 
which depend upon sound wave and optical reflective 
principles. The measurement accuracy varies 
depending on the reflective surface area and index of 
reflection. Moreover, these two methods are used for 
measuring the distance between the measuring 
system and the points to be measured, but reflective 
measurement methods may find it difficult to 
measure the distance between two arbitrary points. 
 
Image distance measurement methods typically 
comprise image identification and image signal 
analysis [7]-[9], which require high-speed computers 
and DSP systems for complete recording and 
complex calculations of image data. These expensive 
and heavy-duty devices lead to higher cost and less 
flexibility, especially when dealing with the different 
perspectives arising from taking photos at different 
angles between the camera and the ground surface. 
So, further improvement and complex 
setting/calibration are required for practical distance 
measurement and image recording at traffic accident 
sites.  
 
In this paper, an innovative method of recording 
traffic accidents by using small remote-controlled 
robots as the distance-measuring devices is proposed. 
An AI motor is the drive unit of the robot, and a 
reflective optical encoder is mounted onto the wheels. 
The pulse data from the optical encoder is converted 
into distance. The Bluetooth wireless modules 
transmit all remote-controlled signals and measured 
distance data. Meanwhile, a camera system is set at 
the front of the measured area and takes a photo of the 
targeted area. Two parallel straight paths to be 
measured will be displayed on the image screen. A 
remote-controlled robot chooses two arbitrary points 
on each path for distance measurement. The starting 
points and end points will be reflected into the 
corresponding image patterns, such that the starting 
points and end points of two paths form a rectangle.

3. Irregular Area Measurement  
In Fig. 5, ( )idm  is the real distance between the 
intersections of area boundaries and the ith horizontal 
scanning line ( )iNv  of the CCD. ( )iNm  is the 
number of pixels between the intersections of area 
boundaries and the ith horizontal scanning line ( )iNv  of the CCD. ( )ids  is the real distance between 
the intersections of rectangle path and the ith 
horizontal scanning line ( )iNv  of the CCD. ( )iNs  is 
the number of pixels between the intersections of area 
boundaries and the ith horizontal scanning line ( )iNv  of the CCD. 
In Fig. 5, ( )4321 ,,, QQQQ  which form a 
rectangle on the ground, are marked by the 
remote-controlled robot. The rectangle is centered in 
the picture along the line-of-sight. The distance 
between 1Q  and 2Q  is equal to the distance between 
3Q  and 4Q . We obtain ( ) ( ) dsjdsids == , which is 
measured by the robot. According previous studies 
[10]-[13], the relationship between the pixel values 
and real distances are formulated as
