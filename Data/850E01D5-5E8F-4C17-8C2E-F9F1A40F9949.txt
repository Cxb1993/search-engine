The architecture of proposed multiplier is shown in 
Figure 4. The function of this 4x4 abacus multiplier is 
divided into three parts as depicted in Figure 4. 
The first part is BPA (binary product to abacus) 
module. The second part is PA (parallel addition) 
module. The third part is TB (Thermometric to 
Binary) transformation module. The three modules 
are discussed in the following sections. 
 
三、研究方法與成果 
A. The first part is BPA (binary product to abacus) 
module: 
This module converts two 4x2 binary number 
(a3a2a1a0)2*(b1b0)2 and (a3a2a1a0)2*(b3b2)2 into an 
abacus representation (H2H1H0|M2M1M0|L2L1L0)abacus. 
(H2H1H0) represents three up beads with each weight 
of sixteen (42). (M2M1M0) represents three meddle 
beads with each weight of four (41), and (L2L1L0) 
represents three lower beads with each weight of one 
(40). The block diagram of the BPA is shown in 
Figure 5.

An example is demonstrated in Figure 3. 
(a3a2a1a0)2 = (1010)2 = 10 and (b1b0)2 = (11)2 = 3, 
(1010)2 * (11)2= (001|111|011)abacus = (0+0+1)*16 + 
(1+1+1)*4+ (0+1+1)*1 = 30. 
 
Figure 5. Block diagram of BPA module 
 
The behavior of BM module is modeled in the 
equations (1) – (5): 
 
In the previous sections we designed a multiplier 
by using the Chinese abacus methodology. The 
circuits of prototype have been simulated with 
HSPICE by using the transistor models of a 0.35μm, 
and 0.18μm TSMC CMOS technologies. For the 
sake of simplicity, all the lengths and widths of the 
transistors are set to the smallest values allowed by 
each technology. CMOS inverters are used as loads 
in each output in simulations. An inverter is used as 
input buffer to generate a real world signal waveform. 
The simulation results are compared with Braun 
array multiplier listed in Table I and Table Ⅱ. The 
delay is the longest time of signal from input to 
output simulated by all input patterns. The 
simulation results used 0.35μm and 0.18μm TSMC 
CMOS technologies delay time is 6.574ns and 
3.432ns for 8-bit abacus multiplier. The delay of the 
8x8 abacus multiplier is 14.8% less than Braun array 
multiplier for 0.35μm technology. 
The power consumption of these multipliers is also 
listed in Table I and Table Ⅱ. The average results of 
power consumption are all input patterns. The 
simulation is performed at a frequency of 50MHz. In 
0.35μm technology, the power consumption of 8-bit 
multiplier abacus is 3.2% less than that of Braun 
array multiplier. 
From these results, we can expect that abacus 
multiplier will remain competitive with the Braun 
array multiplier.

multiplier by using the 0.35μm TSMC CMOS 
technology.

beads to middle beads (K2K1K0). The behavior of PQ module is

This block can count two column elements with same weight 
and then transform it to thermometric representation K0~K5, 
where 0 ≦ Ki ≦ Kj ≦ 1 for i > j. 
This module acts similarly as multiplexer. The number 
(X2X1X0) is as the input signal of this multiplexer as shown in 
Figure 4. The number (Y2Y1Y0) is as selector to modify the 
configuration of the number (X2X1X0) and results the 
thermometric sum (K5K4K3K2K1K0). There are only four
