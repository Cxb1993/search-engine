resistive switching memory devices using GeOx 
material in Al/Cu/GeOx/W and Al/GeOx/W structures 
were investigated. The Ge nanowire filament can be 
formed in the Al/GeOx/W structure under SET. 
Controllable Cu nanofilament with a small CC of 1nA 
was also obtained. Therefore, a maximum memory size 
of 5000 Pbit/inch2 can be designed in the future.

simultaneously electrochemical process including the reduction/oxidation of Ag ions of the Si atoms is 
responsible. The synthesis of large area oriented nanowire arrays were conducted in a Teflon beaker at 
room temperature. The wafers were first cleaned by standard RCA. Then, the cleaned wafers were 
dipped into the etching solution for 30 min. The length of the Si nanowires could be controlled by the 
immersion time of the Si wafer into the etching solution. The morphology of the silicon nanowires 
were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), as shown in Fig. 1. The 
height of the NWs is approximately 20 µm. However, the longer Si nanowires grown by this method 
needs precise control the reaction and more study is needed.

GeOx on the shell region. The spectrum for the Ge nanowires has been decomposed into four 
component peaks using Gaussian fitting, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). They are found to be centered mainly 
around 387 nm, 402 nm, 433 nm and a weak peak at 483 nm. The origin of the PL peaks is attributed to 
oxygen vacancies Vo-, oxygen-germanium vacancy pairs (VGe,Vo)+ and related defect centers.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      Fig. 4 shows the X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) of the Ge nanowires. The binding 
energies at  32.8 and  29.3 eV are due to the GeO2 and Ge, respectively. This suggests that the shell 
region of the Ge NWs is oxygen-rich and the core region is Ge-rich.

defined through a lithography process. A GeOx film with a thickness of ~10 nm was then deposited by

RF sputtering. The chamber vacuum was 2 × 10-5 Torr. The deposition power and pressure were 50 W 
and 2 × 10-2 Torr, respectively. Argon (Ar) gas with a flow rate of 25 sccm was used. The Ge target was 
used to deposit the GeOx solid electrolyte. Then, a Cu metal layer as a top electrode (TE) with a 
thickness of ~200 nm was deposited using a thermal evaporator. A lift-off process was next performed 
to obtain the final device in a Cu/GeOx/W structure. To investigate the Cu nanofilament, HRTEM was 
performed using an FEI Tecnai G2 F-20 field emission system with an operating voltage of 200 kV. A 
molybdenum (Mo) grid was used for TEM observations. The thickness of the GeOx layer was ~10 nm 
and it appeared partial crystalline. More than 50 devices were measured randomly and all showed 
excellent repeatable unipolar resistance switching (URS) and bipolar resistance switching (BRS) 
characteristics.

 (Cuo → Cuz+ + ze-). During dissolution, the Cu+ ions from the filament also migrate through the 
nanograin boundary site and return to the Cu electrode. After the first cycle, the SET voltage lowers 
due to the easier Cu+ ion migration, which results from the creation of higher defect paths for Cu+ ions.

Repeatable switching from CCs of 1 nA to 1 µA was also observed (cycles 2–4). For CCs of < 10 µA, 
the leakage currents at a Vread of +0.4 V (or -0.4 V) are almost the same as those using a pristine device 
after the RESET operation [Figs. 6(a) and 7(a)]. This observation suggests that the conducting filament 
can be completely dissolved during the RESET process because of the nanochain-type or cylindrical 
filament. However, the leakage current at a Vread of +0.4 V (or -0.4 V) is increased to 37 (or 110) pA at 
a CC of 10 µA, as shown in cycle 6 [Fig. 5(f)]. This suggests that a small amount of Cu metal remains 
at the GeOx/W interface [Fig. 7(b)]. Therefore, the effective thickness of the GeOx film reduces; 
however, Cu/W will not behave as a Cu electrode because there is insufficient Cu at the GeOx/W 
interface. This shows that the filament diameter is increased at a higher CC of >10 µA, and that the 
shape of the filament will be conical in the GeOx film [(Fig. 5(g)]. The Cu filament that remains after 
the RESET process [Fig. 5(h)] helps to form the Cu filament easily after the next SET because of the 
local field enhancement at the tip of the remaining filament on the BE. An ideal hole current at an HRS 
was observed [Fig. 6(b)]. A maximum resistance ratio of ~106 was also found with CCs of 10–50 µA 
[Fig. 7(a)]. The hole current at an HRS was further increased to 18.9 (20.8) µA for a CC of 100 µA 
(cycle 7), which occurs because of the strong nanofilament formation [Fig. 5(i)]. This shows almost 
symmetrical currents for Vread values of both +0.4 V and -0.4 V because a sufficient amount of Cu 
metal remains at the GeOx/W interface and since the BE behaves as a duplicate Cu electrode. The ideal 
schematic current at an HRS is also shown in Fig. 6(c). The resistance ratio thus reduces. After the next 
cycle, we found that the re-growth of the Cu nanofilament starts from -0.75 V rather than dissolution. 
This indicates that a high amount of Cu can migrate through the GeOx film, which will be deposited on 
the W BE at a CC of > 100 µA. At -1.1 V, the current can reach up to 50 mA and there is no RESET 
(cycle 8). This suggests that the Cu can be re-grown on the Cu nanofilament on the TE side from the 
Cu/W BE [Fig. 5(j)]. To dissolve the Cu filament, positive polarity on the TE is reapplied. Stable URS

     where L is the length of the filament [thickness (~10 nm) of the GeOx film], ρfilament (~200 µΩ.cm is 
the resistivity, and A is the cross-sectional area of the filament. Using LRS versus CC from equations 1 
and 2, D increases linearly from 0.13 Å to 25 nm as CC increases from 1 nA to 10 mA. The Cu 
nanofilament was observed by HRTEM after keeping the memory device at SET [Fig. 8(a)]. The 
typical device size was approximately 150 × 150 nm2. The crystalline Cu nanofilament and GeOx film 
(without Cu nanofilament) are shown. The clear crystallization in the GeOx film shows a truncated 
conically shaped Cu nanofilament, which was also confirmed by EDX analysis [Fig. 8(f)]. This 
suggested that the resistive switching phenomenon was due to the Cu nanofilament 
formation/dissolution in the GeOx solid electrolyte rather than the uncontrolled defects in GeOx or at 
the interface defects of Cu/GeOx or GeOx/W.  
         The Cu signal calculated that the Cu electrode, GeOx without filament, and Cu nanofilament in 
the GeOx film are approximately 350, 200, and 400 at a typical energy of 0.92 keV, respectively. It is 
thus clear that the Cu signal is higher (400) in the Cu nanofilament than it would be without the Cu 
nanofilament in the GeOx film. The nanofilament has Cu clusters (or nanocrystals) embedded in the 
GeOx film or it is a Cu:GeOx mixture. The Ag nanocrystal in the filament has also been reported in 
previous research. The Cu clusters was also confirmed by FFT analysis [Figs. 8(b), (c), and (i)], while 
the GeOx film without Cu signals is shown in figures 8(d) and (h). Owing to the small crystals 
(nanograins), the FFT showed a weak signal or an amorphous GeOx film. The crystal d-spacing values 
of 2.0874 Å (Cu) and 2.4506 Å (Cu2O) were observed inside the nanofilament [Fig. 8(b) and (i)],

which is very close to the d-spacing value of pure Cu (111) of 2.0880 Å and similar to the Cu electrode 
[Fig. 8(e)]. The crystal d-spacing value of 2.1953 Å was observed at the Cu filament/W interface, 
which is in between the d-spacing value of Cu (111) and W (110) and was approximately 2.2378 Å 
[Fig. 8(c)]. Varandani et al. also reported (111) planes of Cu in a CuInO2-CuO bilayer structure. For 
this truncated conically shaped crystalline Cu nanofilament, the widths of the base and top are 85 and 
70 nm, respectively, which fits well with our calculated diameters shown in Fig. 8(d). After unipolar 
RESET, a small crystalline GeOx film was observed [Fig. 8(j)]. Further, small crystals (3–5 nm grains), 
an amorphous GeOx film [Figs. 8(k) and (l)], and the remaining Cu on the Cu electrode [Fig. 8(m)] 
were also found. This suggests that the Cu filament has been dissolved almost completely after the 
RESET of the URS mode and thus that the device starts to behave as a pristine device. As presented in 
Fig. 8(d), the filament diameters are consistent with some previously reported results but slightly 
different to others because of the different solid electrolytes, structures, and current overshoot effects. 
Owing to the Cu/GeOx/W structure design, enhanced resistive switching performance can also be 
realized in the future, as discussed below.

interface, (d) GeOx layer without Cu nanofilament, and (e) Cu electrode. (f) All layers and 
filaments are also confirmed by EDX analysis. (h) Some amorphous regions are also

small amount of Cu also remains on the Cu electrode because of higher joule heating on 
the filament’s weak points. Although the weak or defective region of the filament has been 
dissolved, the current at an HRS is almost the same as with the pristine device because the 
microstructure has changed.

    Fig. 9(a) shows the excellent data retention characteristics of the Cu/GeOx/W memory cell in both 
the BRS and URS modes at a Vread of +0.1 V. Data retention is measured after stressing at CCs of 1 nA 
to 50 µA for the BRS mode and 100 µA for the URS mode. Stable currents for both modes were 
observed with an elapsed time of > 104 s. An excellent resistance ratio of 102–105 for bipolar and ~109 
for unipolar modes was also obtained. To investigate the thermal stability of the Al/Cu/GeOx/W device, 
the data retention behaviors at 85oC were also studied [Fig. 9(b)]. A post metal annealing (PMA) with a 
temperature of 400oC for 10 min in N2 ambient was performed. A typical device size was 1.2 × 1.2 µm2. 
After annealing treatment, similar resistive switching memory characteristics with the as-received 
devices were also observed. Both resistance states show very stable with a high resistance ratio of >104 
for more than 200 hrs retention time. Owing to the small diameter of 0.13 Å at a small CC of 1 nA, this 
device (150 × 150 nm2) can be scalable beyond the atomic scale in the future. In the case of the URS 
mode, a memory size of > 1 Tbit/in2 can be obtained, which is higher than previously reported results 
(60 Gbit/in2 [Ref. 9]). Considering the low current operation of 1 nA, a maximum memory size of 
~5000 Pbit/in2 can thus be obtained. 
 
4. Crossbar memory using Cu/GeOx/W structure       
              4.1 Device fabrication 
      First, SiO2 layer with a thickness of approximately 200 nm was grown by wet oxidation process on 
4 inch RCA cleaned p–Si wafers. The horizontal furnace consisted of a quartz tube in which the wafers 
were placed in the middle of the furnace on a carrier made of quartz glass. The temperature of the 
furnace was maintained at 900oC during the oxidation process. To avoid cracks or warping, the wafers 
were placed inside the furnace at 600oC. The furnace was heated slowly with the ramp rate of

aligner.  After  the masking  process,  GeOx  solid–electrolyte  with a  thickness  of ~10 nm was  
deposited  by  the  same  RF  sputtering  system  under  the  same conditions  discussed  in  Chapter 3.  
Following  this,  Cu  as  a  top electrode  with  a  thickness  of ~40 nm  was  deposited  using  thermal 
evaporator. Then, the aluminum (Al) layer with a thickness of approximately 160  nm  was  deposited  
in–situ  by  thermal  evaporator.  Finally, lift–off   process was  performed  to get  the final  
Al/Cu/GeOx/W (S1) memory device. Similarly, Al/GeOx/W (S2) memory device without Cu layer was  
also prepared  for  comparison. Table 1  shows a list  of the fabricated memory  devices using GeOx 
film. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
             4.2 OM and HRTEM images 
      Schematic illustration of the fabricated GeOx –based crossbar memory device is shown in Fig. 
10(a). The GeOx solid–electrolyte is sandwiched between Al/Cu or Al TE and W BE. The optical 
micrograph (OM) of 5×5 cross points structure is shown clearly in Fig. 10(b). However, we have 
analyzed 1×1 cross points in this study for simplicity. Fig. 11 shows the TEM image of 1×1 cross point 
of Al/Cu/GeOx/W structure (device: S1). The area of the cross point is approximately 1.2×1.2 µm2, as 
shown in Fig. 11(a). Layer–by–layer deposited films are clearly observed by HRTEM image (Fig. 
11(b)). The thickness of SiO2 layer is approximately 200 nm. The thicknesses of Al, Cu, and W metals 
are ~ 160, 38, and 180 nm, respectively. The thickness of the GeOx solid–electrolyte is ~ 8 nm.

formation of AlOx (~ 5–6 nm) layer at the Al/GeOx interface (Fig. 12(b)). It is known that the Gibbs 
free energies of Al2O3, GeO2, CuO, and Cu2O films are -1582, -518.8, -129.7, and -149 kJ/mole at 300 
K, respectively. Therefore, the formation of AlOx at the Al/GeOx interface will be easiest as compared 
to those of others. The AlOx layer at the Al/Ta2O5 interface was also observed even though Al layer was 
deposited on Ta2O5 film (not shown here). This suggests that Al is reactive metal with oxygen and it is 
hard to control the reaction at the Al/switching material interface. However, the AlOx film will have 
more defective, which may lead the resistive switching phenomena.

Fig. 14 I–V measurement of pristine devices (a) S1 and (b) S2. Large formation 
voltage is needed for Al TE. Comparison of (c) leakage current and (d) formation 
voltage for device S1 and S2.   
Slightly high voltage of ~1 V is necessary to switch the memory device from HRS to LRS, which is 
shown in the 1st cycle. After formation process, the device shows normal bipolar resistive switching 
behavior. The memory device can be operated at low CC of 1 nA, and cylindrical type filament can be 
expected because the HRS is the same after RESET operation. A change of HRS state is observed at 
CC of 50 µA. At a higher CC of 50 µA, the filament diameter is increased and the shape of the filament 
will be a conical–type.

15. A high resistance ratio of 108 is obtained for future MLC applications. Compare to via structure, the 
unipolar behavior is unstable for crossbar structure. This suggests that the resistive switching properties 
may depend also on structure design.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          
       The RESET current is independent with CCs from 1 nA to 1 mA for Al/GeOx/W memory device, 
as shown in Fig. 16. This suggests that the RESET current scalability as well as device scaling is 
difficult for the Al TE devices, which is larger filament diameter formation (or many conducting 
channels) even a small CC of 1 nA. This is due to strong current overshoot effect in the Al/GeOx/W 
crossbar memory devices. However, the SET current is increasing as increases CCs from 1 nA to 100 
µA. The SET current is also constant even at CC 2 mA. At lower CC, the SET current is the same with 
Fig. 16 SET/RESET currents versus CCs curve. SET current are increasing as 
increases CCs for both the devices. The RESET current increases as increases the CCs 
for Cu TE, however, the RESET current is not scalable for Al TE because of AlOx 
formation at the Al/GeOx interface.

500 µA. Furthermore, larger SET/RESET voltages are obtained for the Al TE devices (S2), which is 
difficult for low power operation and the scalability potential is also difficult. Table 2 summarizes the 
average (SD) values of SET/RESET voltages and LRS/HRS for the devices S1 and S2. In terms of low 
current/voltage operation, the Al/Cu/GeOx/W crossbar memory device is more favorable than that of 
the Al/GeOx/W crossbar memory devices.

both structures with different CCs. The device can be operated as low current as 1 nA. 
Ge nanowire) can be formed in the GeOx switching material. The RESET process will occur when the 
applied negative bias on the Al TE is larger than the RESET voltage and the O2- ions will back to the 
original states (Fig. 18(b)). Due to the defective AlOx layer formation at the Al/GeOx interface, 
uncontrolled oxygen–vacancy filament formation and oxidation by O2- ions can be assumed under SET 
and RESET operations, which will hinder the resistive switching phenomena as well as scaling of the 
device. This suggests that Cu TE device has superior performance without series transistor. However, it 
can be possible to control Ge nanowire filament for the S2 device by using series transistor in future.

and crossbar devices in an Al/Cu/GeOx/W structure. The LRSs are decreased linearly with increasing 
the CCs from 1 nA to 50 µA for both devices, which is applicable for multi-level data storage (MLC) 
operation. By changing of CCs (1 nA to few µA), more than four orders of magnitude of the LRS is

     4.3.5 Endurance and retention characteristics 
         Fig. 20 shows the read endurance for LRS and HRS and more than 105 read cycles with a large 
resistance ratio of >104 have been demonstrated at a large Vread of +0.15 V for device S1. The retention 
behavior of the both resistance states have been studied at 85oC measurement temperature, as shown in 
Fig. 9(b). DC switching cycles and retention characteristics at small CC of 1 nA are also measured, as 
shown in Fig. 21. However, the slight variations of LRS/HRS and SET/RESET voltages are observed 
with 20 DC cycles at CC of 1 nA (Fig. 21(a)), which may be improved in future. Data retention is 
measured more than 30 min. after stressing at CC of 1 nA for Al/Cu/GeOx/W crossbar structure (Fig. 
21(b)), which can be applicable for future low–power high–density non–volatile memory applications

        The Si/Ge nanowires have been prepared by different methods. The NWs are observed by FE-
SEM and TEM images. The defective core-shell Ge NWs are confirmed by XPS and PL spectra. Due 
to defective GeOx, the resistive switching memory characteristics are observed by using Cu/GeOx/W

Report on “International Conference on Materials for Advanced

          It was my great honor and opportunity to join the ICMAT 2011, Singapore. Many scientists on 
material experts from different places of World came to share their knowledge and expertise. More 
than 3000 attendees joined this conference. There were 26 parallel sessions. I joined the Symposium L: 
Memory Nanomagnetics, Materials and Devices. The conference including 9 Plenary Talks, 3 Theme 
Lectures, 2 Public Lectures, and many invited talks has covered vast area on nanomaterials for future 
technology based applications.  I have reported our paper on “Growth of Ge nanowires for nanoscale 
memory applications”.  
 
 
Very Important Talks: 
 
          Freddy, Yin Chiang Boey, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore reported on 
"Biodegradable Cardiovascular Implants". Fully Biodegradable Cardiovascular implants are attractive 
because of the ability to completely biodegrade after fulfilling their therapeutic functions and not have  
long term liabilities that are common with permanent implants. Ideally, the fully degradable implant 
can be delivered with good trackability  and deploy safely and predictably  using minimal changes to 
the delivery system. It should also  have sufficient mechanical strength to provide  structural integrity 
for an acceptable period, and then biodegrade away predictably and harmlessly. This presentation 
reports on two  fully biodegradable  devices  – a  peripheral  cardiovascular stent  and a 
PFO/ASD/PDA (hole in the heart) occlude implant. Both have gone through  animal trials to show 
viable  patency,  minimal inflammation, no thrombogenicity and minimal  occlusion. 
 
        Albert Fert, Nobel Laureate in Physics, Unité Mixte de Physique CNRS/Thales, Route 
départementale 128, 91767 Palaiseau Cedex, and Université Paris-Sud (Orsay), France 
reported on "Challenges and Emerging Directions in Spintronics". Spintronics is a new field of 
research exploiting the influence of the electron spin on electronic transport. It is mainly known for the 
“giant magnetoresistance” (GMR) and the large increase of the hard disc capacity by read heads based 
on the GMR, but it has also revealed many other interesting effects and is now developing along 
promising novel directions. After an introduction on the fundamentals of spintronics, I will review 
some of the most promising directions of today, which will includes the study of the spin transfer 
phenomena, spintronics with semiconductors, spintronics with carbon nanotubes or graphene, 
neuromorphic devices.  In a spin transfer experiment, for example, one manipulates the orientation of a 
nanomagnet by transfusing spin angular momentum into it from a spin-polarized electronic current. 
This electronic spin transfer can be used to switch the magnetization (with near applications to the 
writing of magnetic memories) or to generates oscillations in the radio-wave frequency range (with 
promising applications in telecommunications). Spintronics with semiconductors aims to the fusion 
between conventional electronics and spintronics, while carbon-based spintronics is one of the most 
promising  ways to go “beyond CMOS”, i.e. beyond the silicon-based electronics of today. 
 
       Andre Geim, Nobel Laureate in Physics, University of Manchester, UK reported on "Graphene: 
Status and Prospects". Graphene - single atomic plane pulled out of graphite - is a wonder material. It 
has many superlatives to its name. It is the thinnest material one can imagine and the strongest one 
ever measured. Its charge carriers have zero effective mass and can travel micron distances without 
scattering under ambient conditions. Graphene can sustain current densities thousands times higher 
than copper, shows record thermal conductivity and stiffness, is impermeable to gases and liquids. It 
reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electrons in graphene behave in such a

tremendous flexibility and the ease of controlling the size, shape and various functionalities of 
resulting nanoparticles in the really small size (typically < 10 nm) limit. Targeting and tailoring 
nanocrystals with specific size or composition with desired properties require understanding the 
mechanism that governs the formation of such materials in the nm size regime. I shall discuss a few 
examples of time-resolved studies to elucidate often counter-intuitive growth mechanisms and dopant 
behaviours observed in these systems. This will be followed by illustrating how unexpected 
information on internal structures of complex nanocrystals, for example a quantum-dot quantum-well 
system, can be extracted using a photoemission technique that may be termed "microscopy without a 
microscope"! Finally, I shall relate such derived information to discuss exceptionally high 
photoluminescence efficiencies found in a variety of semiconductor nanocrystals. 
 
 
      Andrew Wee, National University of Singapore reported on "Teaching the Nano Scale – A 
Singapore Perspective". Nanotechnology is considered one of the most important growth areas this 
century. Nanoscience, the science underpinning nanotechnology, is a multidisciplinary subject 
covering atomic, molecular and solid state physics, as well as much of chemistry, with applications in 
biology. Nanostructures are known to exhibit novel and improved material properties. Fundamentally, 
these arise because the physical properties as well as chemical reactivity are very different when 
dimensions are reduced to the nanometre length scale. Nanotechnology education is being offered by 
more and more universities around the world. Universities offer a range of nano-related degrees, for 
example, Bachelor of Science/Engineering in Nanotechnology, Master of Science/Engineering in 
Nanotechnology, and PhD in Nanotechnology. The fundamental scientific principles at the nano scale 
are grounded in physics and chemistry. For this reason, at the National University of Singapore (NUS), 
"Nanoscience" is offered as a Minor programme, as well as a “Nanoscience & Nanotechnology” 
specialization in the Bachelor of Engineering Science degree. The pedagogical issues and experiences 
teaching these courses at NUS are discussed. Science is no longer studied solely within the traditional 
disciplines of physics, chemistry and biology; and scientific research today often requires contributions 
from two or more disciplines. The fields of materials science, biophysics and nanoscience are just a 
few important examples of interdisciplinary science, and our undergraduate curriculum needs to reflect 
this changing scientific landscape. In this context, I will also discuss the new Integrated Science 
Curriculum (ISC) offered at the National University of Singapore, intended for students considering a 
research career in science. The ISC, taught within the Special Programme in Science (SPS) at NUS, 
aims to encourage students to think across disciplinary boundaries, and to be able to address 
contemporary scientific problems from an integrated science perspective. Lectures and activities are 
organized around central themes in science, such as measurement, change, energy, materials, 
conservation, and information. The relationships between different disciplines are emphasized, and 
mathematical and statistical methods are applied to problems across scientific disciplines.

           It was my great pleasure and opportunity to join such a RRAM workshop in IMEC, 2011. All 
leading companies and academics came to share their expertise to develop the RRAM technology for 
future nanoscale nonvolatile memory applications. Total 182 participants were attended this workshop 
including 4 keynotes, 19 invited talks, 32 posters, and 2 panel discussions. I had invited talk and I was 
so pleased to present our recent CBRAM data in front of the leading groups in the World.

         J. A. Kittl (Imec, Belgium) gave welcome and opening remarks regarding 1st International 
Worlshop on Resistive RRAM. H. -S. P. Wong (Stanford, USA) reported the resistive switching 
memory (RRAM) including modeling and scaling studies. The speed of the device is about few ns and 
scaling can be beyond 20 nm for HfOx based memory. R. Waser (Jülich-Aachen Research Alliance-
FIT, Germany) reported the microscopic processes in redox-based resistive switching and showed 
promising for future applications. He is one of the leaders on the RRAM in the World. C. S. Hwang 
(Seoul National University, Korea) reported the collective motion of nano-filaments in Pt/n-type 
TiO2/p-type NiO/Pt stacked resistance switching memory. The nanofilament showed in TiO2 based 
material after SET operation. The interfaces and oxygen migration lead to the resistive switching 
mechanism. F. Chen (ITRI, Taiwan) reported the HfOx based RRAM device with 1T1R configuration. 
The device has high speed 300 ps and can be operated few microamperes.  
 
     J. A. Kittl (Imec, Belgium) reported the progress and challenges on resistive RAM using HfOx and 
VOx materials. The VOx material can show as a volatile, which can be used as a selector of RRAM 
device. R. Degraeve (Imec, Belgium) reported a beautiful filament conduction model of HfOx based 
material, however, it is difficult to realize. D. Ielmini (Politecnico di Milano, Italy) reported the 
switching mechanisms and modeling of filamentary switching in bipolar metal-oxide RRAM using 
NiOx based material. J. Kang (Peking University, China) reported the oxide-based RRAM with unified 
physical mechanism and implementation for cell design optimization, however, it is so complicated to 
understand. L. Larcher (Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Italy) reported the physical modeling 
of HfO2 RRAM device operations. Although many RRAM devices have been reported, however, 
switching mechanism is still debated.  
 
 
Panel Discussion: “What is the switching mechanism of metal oxide RRAM?” 
 
     Due to different systems, electrodes, and switching materials, many results published in the 
literature. Many of them are confusing for the next development. Due to unknown and un reliable data, 
the switching mechanism is not clear and it needs time to go through production line. 
 
100/10/21     
         I. G. Baek (Samsung, Korea) reported the opportunities and risks of the resistive memory in the 
future memory market. He mentioned that it is difficult to use RRAM in future because of no maturity 
of research on this topic. G. Sandhu (Micron, USA) reported the emerging memory opportunities, 
promise and challenges. He told that CBRAM is a possible candidate in future RRAM application. 
B. Govoreanu (Imec, Belgium) reported the Hf-based RRAM: towards 10 nm. It is very promising data 
for application. M. Kozicki (Adesto, USA) reported the CBRAM device using GeS material. He told 
that the CBRAM has a very goop chance and propective for application. He is father of ionic based 
memory, CBRAM device. T. Sakamoto (LEAP(NEC), Japan) reported the triode atom-switch. J. R. 
Jameson (Adesto, USA) reported the physics of Ag/GeSx/W CBRAM cells. He also mentioned that 
this CBRAM device is very useful in near future.

Visited in Winter, IIT, Kharagpur, 2012. 
 
         I went to India with my 6 undergraduate students to discuss the development of the Si/Ge 
nanowire projects. The students learned how to grow Ge nanowire in a hot furnace. The student of Prof. 
Ray demonstrated the growth mechanism of the Ge nanowires. We had also discussion with Prof. Ray, 
IIT Kharagpur, India. He is PI in India of this project. It was great time to share knowledge and 
technology. Prof. Chao-Sung Lai, Co-PI, Taiwan was also visited on end of January, 2012 to develop 
this project.
