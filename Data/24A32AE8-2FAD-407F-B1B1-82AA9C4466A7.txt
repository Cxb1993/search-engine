feedback, position feedback, and integral 
force feedback. However, the above control 
algorithms did not address the issues of 
system uncertainty such as payload changes. 
For most of the portable nanomanipulation or 
inspection equipment, payloads variations are 
often occurred due to gravity position changes 
in process. 
Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) has 
also been explored in a few works. For 
example, one of those works involving QFT 
in active vibration control of 
piezoceramic-based smart structures is discuss 
by Choi et al [15]. R. Comasòlivas et al [16] 
present a methodology to design 
automatically a QFT robust controller for 
plants with model uncertainty to minimize the 
vibration disturbances of line scan CCD 
image by PZT actuator. Sandeep Karande et 
al [17] analyze the performance of a QFT 
based controller in controlling the vibrations 
in flexible multilink robotic manipulator 
systems. Zapateiro et al[18] address the 
problem of designing a QFT based controllers 
for the vibration reduction in a 6-story 
building structure equipped with shear-mode 
magnetorheological dampers. And they also 
applied QFT to nonlinear systems of MR 
damper of suspensions in vehicles by 
representing the nonlinear dynamics as a 
linear system with uncertainties, which 
approximately represents the true behavior of 
the plant to be controlled. [19]. Tsai [20,21] et 
al design QFT controller with consideration of 
hysteresis and payload uncertainties, which is 
applied to micro vibration suppression of 
nano inspection equipment such as scanning 
probe microscope （SPM）or AFM. 
In this work, a novel pendulum type of 
vibration isolation module is proposed, and 
the structure of the vibration isolation module 
is introduced. The dynamic equations of 
motion for the isolation module are developed 
both in horizontal and vertical directions and 
both of the simulation and experimental 
results are compared. QFT controller design is 
utilized for micro vibration suppression and 
the uncertainty of payload variations is 
considered. 
The rest of the paper is organized as 
follows. The structure of the pendulum type 
of vibration isolation module is introduced in 
Section II. Equations of motion developments 
and comparisons of simulation and 
experiment are in Section III and Section IV 
respectively. The payload uncertainty and 
QFT design processes are described in 
Section V and Section VI. The experimental 
results of QFT controller design is 
summarized in Section VII and the brief 
conclusions is made in Section VIII. 
 
III. Description of Isolation Module 
The first pendulum type of micro 
vibration isolation module was developed by 
Anderson et al [7] and commercialized by 
Newport Corp, which is usually applied in the 
number of three or four modules with a huge 
optical table. It shows good performances 
both in vertical and horizontal directions but it 
face the stability problem when acting with 
one leg. Tsai [21] et al develops a novel type 
of pendulum vibration isolation module which 
can support portable nanoscale-inspection 
equipment such as AFM. Then the new type 
of module is easy to move and install instead 
of huge table and multi-modules for 
supporting. The novel pendulum-type 
vibration isolation system consisting of three 
active cables with embedded piezoelectric 
actuators and a passive elastomer layer. The 
major advantage of the design is that passive 
pendulum design attenuates vibration in the 
horizontal direction while active actions 
attenuate the vertical direction at a lower cost. 
The design has very good vibration isolation 
performance and system robustness. Because 
of embedded active piezoelectric elements in 
three pendulum links, it is difficult to 
assemble and the three piezoelectric stacks 
should have similar performances. Otherwise, 
the coupling effect between vertical and 
horizontal directions can be serious. 
In this work, a modified structure of 
vibration isolation module is proposed. As 
shown in Fig. 1. The system comprise an 
active part and a passive part, the active part 
is basically regarded as a mass which is 
separated into two portions by a ring type 
piezoelectric actuator, the upper portion is 
composed of payload disk and a stiff rod 
connecting with accelerometer. The stiff rod 
is screwed with payload disk and passed 
through the hole of ring type piezoelectric

4.2 Dynamic equation in horizontal direction 
In the horizontal direction, the isolation 
module provides a passive damping effect via 
the low first resonance frequency of the 
pendulum-type structure and elastomer layer. 
In deriving the equation of motion of the 
vibration isolation module in the horizontal 
direction, a simplified lumped mass–spring 
model is also adopted. In Fig. 3, M and m 
represent the upper and intermediate masses, 
respectively, and m is assumed to undergo a 
small and non-rotational motion. In addition, 
dh is the disturbance displacement in the 
horizontal direction, xT is the corresponding 
displacement of the upper mass in the 
horizontal direction, and  is the angle of the 　
piezoelectric cables with respect to the 
vertical direction. Finally, kT and cT are the 
stiffness and damping of the elastomer layer 
in the horizontal direction, respectively, and 
ch is the damping of the pendulum. In 
accordance with the energy method, the 
kinetic energy Th and potential energy Vh in 
the horizontal direction are obtained as

 Adopting the Lagrangian formulation, 
the nonlinear dynamic equations of the 
vibration isolation module in the horizontal 
direction can be obtained. Finally, linearizing

V. Experimental validation and analysis of 
dynamic model 
In this section, the validity of the dynamic 
model is confirmed by comparing the 
simulation results for the frequency response 
of the vibration isolation model with the 
equivalent experimental results. In addition, a 
modal analysis is performed to examine the 
dynamic characteristics of the module. The 
default parameter values used in the 
simulations are indicated in Table 1. In 
obtaining the experimental frequency 
response of the system in the vertical 
direction, a chirp sine signal is applied to the 
piezoelectric actuator and the output signal 
obtain from the accelerometers embedded in 
the intermediate mass and the upper mass is 
processed using the dynamic signal analyzer 
HP35670A. 
Figure 4 presents the simulation and 
experimental results for the frequency 
response function between the applied voltage 
V and the acceleration output signal z  in the 
vertical direction. The excitation voltage is a 
1V chirp sine signal generated from the 
dynamic signal analyzer HP35670A and then 
is amplified (five) times to drive the hollow 
ring type piezoelectric actuator. The output 
voltage corresponding to the acceleration in 
the vertical direction is measured by the 
accelerometer with the sensitivity equal to 
10.5 V/g. here g is equal to 9.8m/s2. The unit 
of the figure is given as V/V in dB. From Fig. 
4, it is observed that the simulation results are 
in good agreement with the experimental 
results. To further analyze the passive 
transmissibility in the vertical direction, Fig. 5 
presents the simulation results for the 
frequency response function of the 
transmissibility between the input disturbance

6.2.1 Bounds for robust stability 
After building the plant templates, the 
specified gain and phase margins should be 
sufficient to accomodate all plants represented 
by the nominal plant and uncertainty model to 
ensure a robust performance. To guarantee a 
sufficient phase margin, the loop gain 
(denoted as L)) must not enter the U-contour 
in the Nichols chart at any of the given 
frequencies. Here, the U-contour in Fig. 15 is 
defined as 
LM)j(L1
)j(L  
     (15) 
where L is equal to P0G. Here P0 is the 
nominal plant and G is the controller. As 
shown in [23], the gain margin and phase 
margin are related to ML as follows: 
LM
11   MarginGain  ,180   MarginPhase 0     
)1
M
5.0(cos
L
1    ]180,0[ 0   (16) 
By assigning the phase margin a value 
greater than 300, the ML has a value of 2. Fig. 
12 illustrates the U-contour bounds of the 
vibration isolation system for excitation 
frequencies of 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 Hz, 
respectively. Each of the U contours is like an 
egg shape and the size depends upon the 
variable payload in the uncertainty model. 
 
6.1.3. Bound for disturbance rejection 
Having determined the appropriate values 
of the phase and gain margins, it is necessary 
to define the required disturbance rejection 
capability of the vibration isolation system. In 
accordance with the transmissibility results 
presented in Fig. 5, the required disturbance 
rejection performance is specified as follows: 
[30,40]Hz for  )dB10(31623.0
)j(D
)j(Y
2  
   
(17) 
where D is the disturbance input and Y is 
the displacement of the base mass. Once the 
QFT bounds have been specified, a 
loop-shaping process is performed to design 
the controller. Fig. 15 illustrates the resulting 
loop gain L in the Nichols chart based on the 
nominal plant P0. It is seen that the loop gain 
L does not enter the U-contour at any of the 
specified frequencies, and thus the robustness 
of the control performance is ensured. In 
addition, it is seen that the magnitude of L at 
each frequency is higher than the given 
disturbance bound. The frequency response 
function of the controller is shown in Fig. 16. 
The two controllers using H and integrated 
H/QFT is shown in Fig. 17. It is clear that 
the H/QFT provide a high gain within the 
control bandwidth and attenuate the gain 
dramatically out of the designed bandwidth.   
 
6.2 Results and Discussions 
The performance of the designed 
controller was evaluated by performing a 
series of closed-loop experiments under 
different payload conditions using a chirp sine 
signal to simulate the disturbance. Fig. 18 
compares the response function obtained in 
the closed-loop experiment using a payload of 
30 kg with the equivalent open-loop response 
function. From inspection, the controller is 
found to achieve an average disturbance 
rejection of 10 % dB over the frequency range 
of 30–40 Hz. To verify the robustness of the 
designed controller toward variations in the 
payload mass, a further series of experiments 
was performed using payloads of 20 and 40 
kg, respectively. The experimental results 
presented in Figs. 19 and 20, respectively, 
confirm that the controller achieves the 
required disturbance rejection specification in 
both instances within the control bandwidth. 
However, there are some spillover into the 
low frequency ranges which requires further 
study in reducing the spillover effects.  
 
VII. Conclusion 
A novel active–passive pendulum-type 
vibration isolation module has been proposed 
comprising three active cables with embedded 
piezoelectric actuators and a passive 
elastomer layer. The equations of motion of 
the system in the vertical and horizontal 
directions have been derived using a 
Lagrangian formulation and have been 
verified experimentally. Moreover, based on a 
passive analysis, the active control 
specification required to achieve a broadband 
disturbance rejection capability has been 
deduced. The qualitative feedback theory is 
then applied to build the model template at the 
specified frequencies. Finally, a 
H/QFT-based controller has been designed 
to ensure a high disturbance rejection 
capability over the frequency range The

63×  Jacobian matrices which could transform the vectors 
applied at the tips jT  and kT , respectively from the Cartesian 
space into the joint space. By applying the Jacobian analysis to 
(3), the constraint forces ciλ  applied at the tips of legs are 
recognized as internal forces for the moving platform [8]. In 
the following section, the constraint forces ciλ  are used to 
decompose the reaction forces applied at the spherical joints 
iT . The dynamics of the moving platform could therefore be 
formulated as a dynamic payload upon the actuated legs.

SYSTEM 
A. Decomposition of the reaction forces 
 Let Trizriyrixi fff ][=rF  denote the reaction forces in 
the Cartesian space applied at the spherical joints iT  as shown 
in Fig. 2. Based on the identification of the constraint forces to 
be internal forces for the moving platform, the reaction forces 
irF  could be represented as follows:

where iCTF  are the constraint forces applied at the spherical 
joint iT  and they are given as:

The forces ioF  in (4) are applied at the spherical joints iT  and 
they are responsible in manipulating the motion of the moving 
platform as shown in the following paragraph.

computational efficiency for calculating the reaction forces 
such that it could be used as a feasible model for the model-
based controller design. 
IV.  DECENTRALIZED CONTROL AND SIMULATION RESULTS 
A. Decentralized control algorithm 
The architecture of the decentralized control based on the 
dynamic model in (9) consists of two parts as shown in Fig. 4. 
The first part focuses on decoupling the actuated legs from the 
moving platform through compensation of the reaction forces. 
The second part is to apply the feedback linearization 
algorithm to compensate for the dynamics of the actuated legs. 
The computation of the reaction forces involves the dynamic 
payload oXEPJ γT  and the constraint forces ccA λT . Here, the 
nominal values of the dynamic forces for the moving platform 
oγ  are calculated by the desired task coordinates dX  and then 
transformed into the joint space by the Jacobian matrix 
)()( dT XPqJ XE . The difference between oγ  calculated by the 
desired coordinates dX  and the measured X  is regarded as 
system uncertainty. After computing the dynamic payload, the 
nominal constraint forces cλ  can be determined by (10).  
 By applying the decentralized control in Fig. 4, the error 
dynamics of each decoupled actuated leg can be determined as 
follows.

The disturbance could be compensated by the observer [9] or 
some other robust control technique.  
B. Simulation results 
In this paragraph, computer simulations are performed to 
investigate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. 
Parameters used in the simulations are listed in Table I unless 
stated otherwise. To simulate the motion during the machining 
process, one can assume a cutter is attached at the mass center 
of the moving platform. The tip of the cutter is assigned to 
trace a circular trajectory on the plane Z=−1.5m with a radius 
equal to 0.05 m. The circular trajectory is obtained from a 
sphere centered at )5375.1,1745.0,0( −  with a radius equal to 
0.0625 m and the cutter is assigned to be perpendicular to the 
tangent plane of the sphere. Since the moving platform only 
possesses 3 DOF, an X–Y table is utilized to provide the 
machine tool to move on the X–Y plane and the moving 
platform could provide the tool to perform the rotational 
motion.  
The angular velocity of the circular trajectory is assigned 
to be 
2
π rad/sec. The bandwidth of the position loop is selected 
to be 31.4 rad/sec which is about 20 times that of the angular 
velocity of the assigned trajectory. To demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, two control 
strategies are compared as follows: 
Disturbance Observer based Decentralized Control (DODC): 
The DODC uses the disturbance observer to estimate the 
coupling dynamics without considering the dynamics of the 
moving platform and the constraint forces. Only the dynamics 
of each of the legs is compensated.  
Model-Based Decentralized Control with Disturbance 
Observer (MBDCDO): The MBDCDO is a model-based 
control using the proposed decoupled model where the 
coupling dynamics can be compensated in advance. The 
disturbance 
iS
Δ  is further compensated by the disturbance 
observer. To investigate the system robustness, a payload 
uncertainty 10kg is added into the moving platform.  
 The position errors using the MBDCDO and DODC are 
compared as shown in Fig. 5a and 5b. In Fig. 5a, it is shown 
that the position error 
1S
e of the DODC reaches the steady 
state in 1 sec and the maximum transient error is about 
481 um . The transient response of the DODC is apparently 
much worse than that of the MBDCDO. This is because the 
DODC cannot compensate for the reaction forces in advance 
such that the errors in the transient state are very large as 
shown in Fig. 5a. For the MBDCDO, the position error 
1S
e  
could reach the steady state in about 0.4 sec and the maximum 
transient error is about 70 um  under the 10kg payload 
uncertainty which verifies the system robustness of the 
proposed decentralized control scheme. For the steady state 
response, the discrepancy between MBDCDO and DODC is 
not obvious as compared with the transient response. The
