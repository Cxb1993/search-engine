lighting, such as incandescent and 
fluorescent lamps [1]. However, the LED 
issues with high cost, high junction 
temperature, low luminous efficiency, and 
low reliability have to be resolved before 
gaining more market penetration [2, 3].  
In case of GaN-based LED, the poor 
thermal path occurred on the sapphire 
layer (~35 W/m°C) so that the heat 
dissipation becomes an important issue [4]. 
Therefore, how to decrease the junction 
temperature of LEDs becomes significant.  
The flip-chip (FC) bonding is one of 
the advanced chip assembly techniques in 
IC packaging industry. Conventionally, 
the chip was bonded on the substrate with 
die attach adhesive and with wire bonding 
(WB) for electrical interconnects. In 
contrast, the solder bumps are deposited 
on the bond pad of the chip and then the 
chip is flipped to the substrate for bonding 
assembly. Therefore, flip chip technology 
is one of the popular advanced chip 
packaging techniques in current IC 
packaging industry. This technology may 
provide a solution to enhancing heat 
dissipation. Unlike the conventional wire 
bonding technique, the heat will flow 
directly through the interconnecting metal 
bumps between the LED chip and the 
sub-mount substrate thus improving the 
thermal conduction. Therefore, FCLED 
structure may provide high power and low 
junction temperature LED packaging. 
 
Experiments 
The goal of this study is 
experimentally and numerically to study 
the thermal performance of flip-chip LED 
(FCLED) with and without underfills and 
to compare with conventional wire bond 
LED (WBLED). The chip-on-plate (COP) 
LED package is used as the package 
platform. 
A. Specimens 
The test specimens are divided into 
conventional WBLED and FCLED with 
and without underfills in this study. The 
detailed geometry and materials 
configuration of a WBLED package and a 
FCLED are shown in Figure 1(a) and (b), 
respectively. The main materials of the 
conventional WBLED package include an 
aluminum substrate, commercial 1mm 
×1mm LED chip, and die attach of silver 
epoxy. In addition, the main materials of 
FCLED package also have an aluminum 
substrate, a commercial 1mm ×1mm LED 
chip, an aluminum nitride sub-mount and 
Au bumps. Besides, the fabrication of 
FCLED was done by flipping 1mm ×1mm 
LED chip on an aluminum nitride 
sub-mount with four Au bumps (with 110 
μm in diameter and 80 μm high). Both 
devices were housed in the chip-on-plate 
(COP) packages.

(4) There is 78% input power converted 
into heat, which is uniformly distributed

Material thermal conductivities for 
LED package used in this analysis were 
listed in Table 1. Moreover, The 
convection coefficients for the package 
were from the Ellison-based formulation 
in equation (2) associated with Table 2. 
The calculation has to be iterated until 
temperature value converges, due to the 
convection coefficients as function of the 
surface temperature.

Results and Discussion  
For studying the thermal behaviors of 
the WBLED and FCLED with four Au 
bumps in COP package, the junction 
temperature tester and thermocouples 
were used to measure the junction 
temperature (Tj) and surface temperature 
(Ts) of these LED packages. The results of 
temperatures and thermal resistance (Rth) 
for both packages under different input 
powers are shown in FIGURE 2(a) and (b), 
respectively. It is clear that the Tj, Ts, and 
Rth of  the FCLED are higher than those 
of the WBLED. For understanding this 
phenomenon, an ANSYS simulation and 
an Infrared thermal imager measurement 
were implemented and their results are 
shown in FIGURE 3. It can be found that, 
from both results, the FCLED with four 
Au bumps has a large thermal gradient on 
the sapphire’s surface (or die surface) and 
the lowest temperature occurs at the places 
where Au bumps were located. On the 
contrary, the simulation result indicates 
that the thermal field of WBLED on the 
die surface is uniform. To further 
understand this thermal problem, ANSYS 
simulation was carried out and verified by 
 6  
without underfill, the Tj and temperature 
difference between the maximum and the 
minimum on the chip surface of the 
FCLED package are shown in FIGURE 5 
from simulation results. It is shown that 
the Tj and temperature difference decrease 
as the thermal conductivity of the 
underfills increases. Thus, in the 
experiment, the 0.3 oC/W thermal 
conductivity of underfills was chosen to 
improve the thermal behavior of the 
FCLED, because this thermal conductivity 
is close to silicone encapsulant (which is a 
commercial material to protect the LED 
chip in the LED industry). The Rj-a and 
Rj-s of WBLED and FCLED with and 
without underfills packages are shown in 
FIGURE 6. It can be seen that the Rth 
decreases by up to 20.6 oC /W (~16%) 
when using the FCLED with underfills 
instead of the FCLED without underfills. 
Moreover, the Rth of FCLED with 
underfills can be closed to the WBLED. 
Furthermore, this thermal model was 
applied to the parametric study for getting 
a better design of thermal conductivity of 
underfills and number of Au bumps for 
the FCLED packages in order to decrease 
Tj, and Rth.

and FCLED with and without underfills in

Furthermore, for improving the 
thermal performance of this FCLED 
package, the number of Au bumps and the 
underfills with different thermal 
conductivity was studied by the validated 
ANSYS model. The thermal 
conductivities with 0.3 W/m°C, 1.5 
W/m°C, and 3.8 W/m°C in underfills and 
the number of Au bumps with 4, 8, 12, 
and 20, were selected. The results shown 
in FIGURE 7 indicated that the Rj-a of this
