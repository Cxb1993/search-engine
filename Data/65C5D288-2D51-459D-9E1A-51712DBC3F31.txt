 Abstract 
In the field of wireless sensor networks, existing works of channel-aware fusion 
rule design assume that the fusion center (FC) knows the local sensor detection 
probabilities. However, this paradigm ignores the possibility of unknown sensor alarm 
responses to the event occurrences. This work focuses on the case where the local 
detection probability is unknown and assumes sensors transmit their one-bit reports 
through binary symmetric channels to FC. Traditionally, Generalized Likelihood Ratio 
Test (GLRT) can tackle this scenario, but it does not guarantee optimal performance 
and is too complicated to analyze. To solve these problems, a simpler fusion rule is 
proposed based on the simplified ML estimate, and its performance is analyzed. By 
investigating the channel effects, a power allocation scheme is then proposed to further 
improve the performance. Being far less complicated than GLRT, the proposed fusion 
rule with power allocation outperforms GLRT significantly and can even achieve the 
performance of LRT, which is the optimal rule for any possible detectors.

Introduction 
 
Distributed detection systems are typically composed of many sensors and an FC, 
working collaboratively to detect an event of interest. With significant progresses in 
wireless communications, networking and microprocessors, distributed detection using 
wireless sensor networks (WSN) has become an active research area, [1-3]. In WSN, 
sensors are connected by wireless channels to each other and FC so that they can be 
flexibly deployed, enhancing the surveillance coverage and the sensing potential, 
especially in applications like battlefield and monitoring for security or environment. 
In contrast to traditional communication systems, sensors are usually cheap device 
with low power usage; together with limited channel capacity, the stringent 
communication resources make the system design quite challenging. Conventionally, 
signal processing algorithms are treated as independent part of the communication 
block, and thus most of the earlier studies are based on the idealized assumption that 
the sensor reports can be received at FC without errors [3, 4], which are so-called 
classical distributed detection problems. As is proved that designers should integrate 
the signal processing algorithms design and the communication aspect to reach the 
optimal performance, it is especially true in WSN where channels cannot be assumed 
reliable anymore compared to those in classical distributed detection. Recently there 
have been several proposals further taking into account the communication channel 
impairments [5-9]; see [10] for a tutorial introduction to distributed detection in the 
presence of non-ideal channel links. A common assumption made in these 
channel-aware schemes is that the local sensor detection performance, characterized by 
 characterization of the channel effect. Secondly, it is shown that, under certain 
conditions, the global detection performance can be improved by enhancing the 
communication-link quality, e.g., reducing the average link bit-error rate (BER). Hence, 
this work then proposes an optimal power allocation scheme to minimize the mean 
BER subject to a total power budget. Thirdly, simulations show that the proposed 
alternative scheme outperforms GLRT. The rest of this report is organized as follows. 
Chapter 2 traces the main developments in the field of distributed detection and gives 
reviews of related works in WSN. Chapter 3 starts with the problem formulation, 
presents the GLRT based detection scheme and then derives the approximate ML 
solution. Chapter 4 introduces the alternative approach and derives the associated 
analytic performance results. The issue of channel impairment mitigation for 
improving the detection performance is then addressed. In Chapter 5 the simulation 
results are shown and interpreted. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes this report and suggests 
some future works. 
 problem formulations are proposed, and one kind of the prevailing applications is the 
system involving both distributed sensors and an FC. Specifically, the fusion center 
makes the final decision based on the information gathered from local sensors. In the 
following context, let’s confine the notation “distributed detection systems” to such 
systems without otherwise noted. If the raw observations of the local sensors are 
accessible at FC, this scenario is just the classical hypothesis testing problem [13]. 
Unfortunately, due to the limited communication resources such as channel capacity 
between sensors and FC, the observations are often compressed at local sensors and 
then transmitted to FC.  
In distributed detection systems, the classical distributed detection had been an 
active research field following the seminal work of Tenney and Sandell in 1981 [14], 
where the so-called canonical distributed detection system is established. This system 
assumes that the distributed sensors communicate directly through parallel channels, as 
illustrated below,

 values describing the accuracy of the global decision, which are { }0 1Pr 1 |s = H , 
{ }0 0Pr 1 |s = H , { }0 1Pr 0 |s = H  and { }0 0Pr 0 |s = H . The first one and the 
second one is called the detection probability dP  and the false-alarm probability fP , 
respectively. In most cases of detector designs, the values of dP  and fP  are a 
trade-off, which means that designers can hardly increase dP  but decrease fP  at the 
same time. The ROC curve plots these two values of the global decision, with fP  
being the x-axis and dP  being the y-axis. A typical ROC curve is illustrated as 
follows:

According to classical distributed detection theory, a detector generally calculates a 
statistic as a function of the received reports from all sensors and then compares the 
 in many cases there are unknown parameters in the prior knowledge, for example the 
prior knowledge is probably ( )0 0; ,p θx H  and ( )1 1; ,p θx H , where 0θ  and 1θ  are 
unknowns. LRT then serves as the foundation of modification in such cases. Two 
major approaches to these situations are Bayesian approach and GLRT. 
Bayesian approach considers the unknown parameters as realizations of random 
variables and assigns to each of them a prior PDF. Following the previous example of 
binary hypothesis, it has 
( ) ( ) ( )0 0 0 0 0; | ;p p p dθ θ θ= ∫x xH H  
( ) ( ) ( )1 1 1 1 1; | ;p p p dθ θ θ= ∫x xH H  
It then applies the optimal LRT and decides 1H  if

This approach has to make further assumption about the unknowns 0θ  and 1θ , and it 
often require multidimensional integrations, which are often too complicated to 
implement in practice. 
GLRT still borrows the way LRT detects because it is the optimal rule when the 
prior knowledge of probability distribution is known. Instead of making the 
probabilistic assumption of the 0θ  and 1θ , GLRT replaces the unknown parameters 
by their maximum likelihood estimates. This replacement is straight forward but there 
are no optimal criteria involved, and it has been shown that GLRT is generally not the 
best detector in the cases where unknown parameters are present. Although it is 
probably not optimal, it is still a popular approach in practice due to easy 
implementations. 
In analyzing detectors for situations with unknown parameters, one often generates 
the optimal LRT by replacing the estimates of the unknowns with the real values, 
  
Figure 2.3: Canonical distributed detection systems with channel blocks 
 
In the block diagram, the blocks in the dotted line can be regarded as the 
communication block. A practical and straightforward approach [16] is to separate the 
global decision task into a two stage process – first, iˆs  is used to infer about is , and 
then apply the optimum fusion rule based on is . This methodology treats the 
communication block and the classical distributed detection system as two independent 
parts so that once the communication problems are solved, the fusion rules developed 
in the field of classical distributed detection can be applied directly. 
A more basic question arises whether one can design the wireless communication 
block alone irrespective of the signal processing algorithm at the local sensors and FC. 
The answer is unfortunately negative. When one designs the communication block, all 
the efforts are actually placed in recovery the is ’s from the iˆs ’s. However, the 
ultimate goal is not to recover the is ’s but to infer the underlying hypothesis, and any 
deviating intermediate processing of the signal flow is vulnerable to losing information 
for inference. It means that the signal processing algorithms designed for the classical

 approximation of low-SNR turns to the heuristic alternative 3Λ . Simulations show 
that the proposed LRT-CS rule outperform 1Λ  and 3Λ , and it performs better than 
2Λ  for most practical SNR values.  
After surveying relevant papers, we find that in general, most papers in 
channel-aware fusion rule assume that the local sensors’ decision rules, or alternatively 
their local detection performance characterized by detection probabilities and 
false-alarm probabilities, are known to FC. However, these scenarios ignore the 
possibly unknown sensor responses to the occurrence of the interested event. In our 
work, the false-alarm probability of sensors is properly assumed not to change 
significantly with the environments because false-alarm probability is defined under 
the condition where the event is not happening. However, the detection probability is 
probably varying with the intensity of the event. For example, consider a sensor 
network deployed to monitor the rise in temperature in a room to detect the outbreak of 
a fire. In practice, the characteristics of a fire are uncertain, e.g. the mean temperature 
may vary from 100 to 1000 degrees depending on the severity of the fire or the type of 
the fire. Moreover, the characteristics of the fire are probably time-varying. As is 
introduced above, when there are unknowns in the PDF of the received signals, the 
optimal LRT rule is not applicable anymore and the alternative method GLRT puts the 
ML estimate of the unknown into the original LRT statistic and then compare it with 
the predetermined threshold. Our work starts from this popular GLRT and tries to 
simplify the complex ML estimates. However, the birth of GLRT is from heuristic 
thoughts so that it works fine in practice but not optimally in theory. Moreover, the 
formulation of GLRT statistic inherited from LRT is too complicated to analyze even if 
the ML estimates are simplified. These two main reasons motivate our design of new 
simple detection rule, which even performs far better than GLRT. In the following 
sections, the performance of the proposed simple detection rule is analyzed and the 
 Chapter 3  
GLRT Based Detection Method 
 
3.1 System Model 
Consider WSN of N identical sensors for detecting the occurrence of the event of 
interest. Specifically, the sensors monitor a certain parameter in this event. If this 
parameter exceeds a certain value, they should claim the event happening and transmit 
their decisions to the FC. The FC then combines all these decisions from the sensors 
and makes a global decision on whether the event is happening. Detailed system model 
description for each stage is introduced as follows. In the first stage, the status of the 
event can be regarded as binary hypothesis with 0H  and 1H  denoting the absence 
and presence of the event, respectively. Each sensor makes its binary decision on the 
hypothesis, transmitting 1is =  if it claims 1H  and remaining silent if it claims 0H , 
i.e., { }0,1is ∈ . That is, the reports to FC are hard decisions. Assume uniformity of the 
phenomenon of interests in the area where WSN is deployed, so that each sensor 
subjects to a known identical false-alarm probability { }0 0Pr 1 |f ip s π= = H , 
which can be measured before deploying the WSN. Assume also that each sensor 
possesses an unknown identical detection probability { }1 1Pr 1 |d ip s π= = H , 
which has to be estimated at FC. 
The sensors then transmit their 1-bit decisions is  through binary symmetric 
channels with different cross-error probabilities. Assume FC knows the CSI and is in

3.3 Proposed Simplified ML solution 
To obtain the ML solution of 1π , one has to solve certain roots of the polynomial 
with order 1N − . It can probably be achieved by numerical techniques, but no 
analytic solution exists. Thus for higher SNR, an approximated solution is proposed. 
In the high SNR case, iε ’s are small and we has

Simulations tell that the proposed ML estimate approximates closely to the real one 
when the mean cross-error probability is small, for example below 0.2. 
 
3.5 Discussion 
Although the proposed Formula (3.11) is only an approximation of the true ML 
solution, the property of being affine in the data ir ’s makes it more attractive and 
potentially amenable for analysis. Simulations show that the mean square error 
between Equation (3.11) and the true ML solution is quite small when mean 
cross-error probability is small. Accordingly, the performances of GLRT by 1ˆπ  and 
the true ML solution are also quite close. The solution (3.10) also has an appealing

We arrive at the same conclusion as (3.13), which suggests the simplified ML estimate 
is actually nothing but a modification from the natural voting scheme. 
 
3.6 Summary 
An accurate approximation formula (3.11) to the true ML solution is derived and it 
has a natural interpretation related with the straightforward voting scheme. This 
formula is more tractable in that it is an affine function in the received signal ir ’s. To 
accomplish the GLRT test, the FC then adopts this simplified ML estimate in the LRT 
statistic and compares it with a predetermined threshold. However even with the 
simplified formula, the achievable detection performance of GLRT, in particular the 
impact from channel impairments, remains quite difficult to characterize especially 
when the number of sensors is finite. It motivates us to propose an alternative detection 
rule which can exploit the affine nature of 1ˆπ  and result in analytic study of the link 
error effects.

4.3 Impact due to Channel Effects 
The performance formulas in (4.8) and (4.10) remain non-linear functions of iε ’s. 
It is still difficult to assess the effects of non-ideal communication channels. 
Remember that the proposed ML solution is derived under the high-SNR assumption. 
By further exploiting the assumption that iε ’s are small, (4.8) and (4.10) can be 
simplified considerably, as in the next lemma.

Theorem 4.2 suggests that, when the condition 0 10.5π π< <  is fulfilled, the 
global detection performance improves if the summed link error rate can be made 
small. The assumption 0 10.5π π< <  is actually not too demanding for any 
reasonable sensors. Inspired by Theorem 4.2, a sensor power allocation scheme for 
enhancing the global detection performance is developed next. 
 
4.4 Proposed Power Allocation Strategy 
Recall that the ith sensor transmits 1is =  when it claims 1H  and transmits 
nothing when it claims 0H . Namely, the sensors report their one-bit decisions using 
on-off keying to conserve energy. After incorporating the power allocation strategy, the 
ith sensor actually transmits { }0,1is ∈  multiplied with an amplitude factor ia , 
which is to be designed later on, and the corresponding power allocated to this sensor 
is 2i ip a= . Assume the communication channel between the ith sensor and the FC is 
flat and Rayleigh distributed with the current channel coefficient ih , with the average 
power normalized to 1. Knowing these current channel coefficients, the FC can then 
apply the coherent detection and the received signal iy  from the ith sensor could be 
described by a commonly used discrete-time baseband model

Figure 5.3: ROC curve of fifty-sensor network 
 Figure 5.5 demonstrates the relations of the relative increase in dP  of the 
proposed rule with power allocation over that without power allocation versus the 
average transmit power per sensor. The fP  is fixed to 0.1, and other environment 
settings remain the same, i.e., 0.6dp = , 0.4fp =  and 0 0.05N = . Interestingly, 
the improvement in dP  is smaller when the average transmit power is too high or too 
low, and there is a peak improvement when the average transmit power is equal to 
about 0.8.

To illustrate why too high or too low average power leads to smaller improvement 
in dP , two ROC curves are illustrated for these two extreme scenarios. Figure 5.7 
shows the case where the average transmit power is 0.1, which is extremely small, and 
Figure 5.8 shows the case where the average transmit power is 3, which is 
comparatively high.

Figure 5.7: ROC curve of thirty-sensor network with average power 0.1 
 power allocation. In contrast to high-average-power case where the improvement in 
dP  is somewhat “upper bounded” by LRT, the low average transmit power deprives 
the FC of the margin to tackle with the channel impairments. Thus, the iε ’s decrease 
insignificantly after power allocation, which make the improvement in dP  small. 
 
5.2 Discussion on Proposed Method 
Simulations indicate that the proposed detection rule outperforms GLRT 
significantly, in terms of ROC curve. After the transmit power allocation, the ROC 
curve of the proposed rule moves to the left-upper corner and even approaches the 
LRT bound. It means that the proposed method with power allocation is nearly optimal. 
Also, we can see that for any given value of fP , the improvement in dP  has a peak 
at a certain average transmit power, termed peakp . Average transmit power lower than 
peakp  is too small to have large improvement in dP , and the ROC curve of the 
proposed method after power allocation still has gap from that of LRT. Average 
transmit power greater than peakp  is large enough to raise the ROC curve of the 
proposed fusion rule to the LRT’s ROC curve. But as the performance gap between 
LRT and the proposed fusion rule without power allocation becomes less, the extent of 
improvement is thus less. The ROC curve of the proposed rule with power allocation is 
somewhat “upper bounded” by that of the optimal LRT. Although peakp  generates the 
peak improvement, it is not really the so-called optimal transmit power from the global 
perspective. Indeed, this work suggests using the average power greater than peakp  
because the system performance can approach that of the optimal LRT, but note that 
while the transmit power is larger, the ROC curve of LRT still moves to left-upper 
 not improve much and there is still a gap from the optimal ROC curve of LRT. When 
the transmit power is larger than a threshold, power allocations can raise the ROC 
curve of the proposed fusion rule to that of LRT. However, the relative increase in dP  
diminishes because the performance with power allocation is upper bounded by the 
ROC curve of LRT. 
 scheme. However, even after replacing the simplified ML solution in the GLRT 
statistic, the GLRT statistic remains complicated. 
Aiming at reducing the complexity of GLRT and at seeking for a better 
performance, this work then proposes a simpler fusion rule in Chapter 4. The greatest 
advantage of the proposed fusion rule is that it is simple and retains the affine 
properties of the proposed ML approximation, making it easy to analyze. The rule also 
uses the core information reflecting the state of the environments. A tight bound for the 
ROC curve is proposed and for high SNR, it further indicates that the channel effects 
come into the bound of global detection and false-alarm probability only through the 
summation of cross-over probability. A proof is also given under some reasonable 
assumption, claiming that minimizing the summation term guarantees better 
performance in ROC curve, and a power allocation strategy is then proposed to meet 
this goal. Simulations show that the proposed fusion rule outperforms GLRT, and after 
power allocation, the ROC curve of the proposed fusion rule can even approach the 
optimal LRT benchmark.  
The key reason GLRT performs poorly is that in contrast to LRT where the 
environmental parameters in LRT statistic are known and identical in all hypotheses, 
GLRT replaces these fixed parameters with the ML estimates, whose values vary 
between different hypotheses. In sum, GLRT only borrows the formula but behaves 
differently. Another interesting feature of the proposed fusion rule is that channel 
effects come into the performance by the summation of cross-over probabilities. It 
means that the sensors with poor channels should transmit more power as 
compensation, which is different from the conventional communication system that to 
maximize capacity, water-filling is applied so that some parts of system with poor 
channels are allocated less power or even turned off. Note that the basic difference 
between these two systems is that in conventional communication systems, the

估計法(ML estimate)的化簡，接著根據此化簡，為融合中心設計出較GLRT簡單

不但大幅降低複雜度，效能更有顯著的改善，甚至接近偵測系統所能達到的理
論最佳值。
We focus on the detection and estimation problem in wireless sensor
network and propose a decentralized solution by using the concept of
nonlinear dynamic systems. First, a simpler fusion rule is proposed
based on the simplified ML estimate, and its performance is analyzed.
By investigating the channel effects, a power allocation scheme is
then proposed to further improve the performance. Being far less
complicated than Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), the
proposed fusion rule with power allocation outperforms GLRT
significantly and can even achieve the performance of LRT, which is
the optimal rule for any possible detectors.
