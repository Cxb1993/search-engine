中文摘要 
近年來由於半導體技術的突飛猛進，使
得快閃記憶體的單位製造成本下降及其記
憶容量得以增加，再加上快閃記憶體本身
具有低功率消耗及儲存資料不隨電源關閉
而消失的非揮發特性，因此目前快閃記憶
體已經大量使用於許多手持式消費性電子
產品如 MP3 播放器、數位相機及智慧型手
機等用途。此外隨著電子產品尺寸不斷縮
小及功能日益增強，使得快閃記憶體必需
嵌入於系統晶片中以儲存資料與程式碼。 
目前快閃記憶體的測試方法與傳統記
憶體的靜態隨機存取記憶體與動態隨機存
取記憶體的測試方法極為相似但是又不盡
相同，為滿足手機設計等業界的需求，矽
智財供應商通常會同時提供嵌入式快閃記
憶體與傳統記憶體給客戶。因此為降低晶
片面積、減少測試成本與保護商業機密，
供應商必需將快閃記憶體與傳統記憶體的
植入式自我測試電路整合在單一矽智財電
路中。 
基於此，我們在研究快閃記憶體與傳統
記憶體的測試方法後，在本研究計畫中將
各式快閃記憶體與傳統記憶體的測試方法
整合在單一植入式自我測試電路中以節省

Abstract 
With the impressive improvements of 
semiconductor technologies, the memory 
capacity of the flash memory is progressively 
increasing while the cost per unit is going 
down. Moreover, due to the power 
consumption and the non-volatile 
characteristics, the flash memories are 
superior to the other kinds of memory storage. 
Therefore the flash memories are popular and 
widely used in the electronic products, such as 
MP3 player, DSC, and smart phone, etc..  
To meet the requirements for decreasing 
the size of electronic products, the embedded 
flash memories and static (dynamic) random 
access memories (SRAM/DRAM) have been 
used in the system-on-a-chip (SOC) to save 
the data and program code. Therefore, the 
flash memory and SRAM / DRAM silicon 
intellectual property (SIP) have been usually 
integrated and shipped out to the customers. 
So far, both the test algorithms for the 
embedded flash memories and SRAMs / 
DRAMs are similar but not exactly. To save 
the testing cost, in this project, we will survey 
all kinds of the testing algorithms for the flash 
memory and SRAM/DRAM, then we will 
integrate these testing algorithms into a single 
built-in self-test (BIST) architecture with a 
reduced hardware overhead. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
With the rapid progress in the VLSI 
fabrication process, a complex system can 
now be integrated into a system-on-a-chip 
(SoC). Embedded memory cores are essential 
to the performance of an SOC. However due 
to the limitation of the I/O pins, it is difficult 
to test embedded memory cores externally. 
Thus the built-in self test (BIST) schemes 
have been widely used to solve this problem 
[1]. Flash memories are a type of non-volatile 
memory, which are becoming more and more 
popular for System-on-Chip.  
Flash memories are a type of non-volatile 
RAM cells concurrently. The Erase operation 
is much slower than the Program operation, 
which in turn is slower than the Read 
operation.  
Several March-like algorithms for flash 
memories to cover the disturbance faults have 
been proposed and developed a BIST design 
suitable for the flash memories.  
An r-step march-like algorithm with each 
element (denoted by Si) having at most k r/w 
operations can be expressed as:  
<march-like algorithm> ::= {<Si> | i = 1, …, 
r} (1) 
<Si> ::= <address order> ((<opj> | j = 1, …, 
k)) 
<address order> ::= ⇑ (ascending address 
sequence) or ⇓ (descending address sequence) 
or 1D⇑  (diagonal-one up sequence) or ! 1D⇑  
(up sequence except diagonal-one cells) or 
1D⇓  (diagonal-one down sequence) or ! 1D⇓  
(down sequence except diagonal-one cells) or 
2D⇓  (down sequence except diagonal-two 
cells) 
<opj> ::= ( )E  or ( )P  or ( )R  
where the notations E, P, and R represent the 
Erase, Program, and Read operations, 
respectively.  
Due to the cell array organization, the fault 
models of the NAND and NOR Flash 
memories are different, thus their testing 
algorithms are also distinct.  
Assume a flash memory with m rows and n 
columns is to be tested. The testing algorithms 
for NOR Flash are:  
(A1) Flash March [1]: 
{( ); ( 1, ); ( 0);( ); ( 1, ); ( 0)}E R P R E R P R⇑ ⇓c c  
(A2) March FT [2]：  
{( ); ( 1, , 0); ( 0);( ); ( 1, , 0);

( 0);( ); ( 1, , 0); ( 1);

On the other hand, the testing algorithm for 
NAND Flash is: 
(B1) NAND-FT [4]： 
! !
! ( 1, 1)
{( ); ( ); (( 1) ,( 0) );( ); ( );
(( 0) ,( 1) );( 0) }

The tradeoff between the fault coverage and 
testing time of the March-FT algorithm is 
superior to the other algorithms in the NOR 
Flash testing [3]. Therefore, in this project, the 
March-FT algorithm is used to test the NOR 
Flash.  
In the next section, the March-FT and 
NAND-FT algorithms have been integrated 
into a single BIST platform to test the NOR / 
NAND Flash memories.  
IV. THE MERGED TEST PATTERN 
GENERATOR 
Fig. 1 shows a single test platform for 
several march-like algorithms. The address 
order and operations for each march element 
can be represented by a group of seeds which 
are constituted by the operation length, 
address code, and operation code.  
 
Then these seeds are put into the test pattern
